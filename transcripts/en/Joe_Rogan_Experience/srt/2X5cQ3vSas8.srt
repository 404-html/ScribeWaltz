1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,060
Fresh back from her lion
hunting safari in Africa.

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:03,931
Esther,

3
00:00:03,931 --> 00:00:04,231
cool.

4
00:00:04,231 --> 00:00:05,064
You're here.

5
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:05,520
I,

6
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,090
I'm just this line mania today.

7
00:00:09,091 --> 00:00:09,440
I asked her,

8
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,540
I'm paying attention is I can't
know what happened with lions day,

9
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:13,920
but some dude,

10
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:14,310
uh,

11
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:15,143
killed,

12
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:15,660
uh,

13
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:18,510
like a loved lion that had a gps collar.

14
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:23,640
They lured away from this protected area
where it was living and he killed it

15
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:24,810
and uh,

16
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:26,960
they tried to hide the
fact that he killed it.

17
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:29,070
He's a dentist in Minnesota.

18
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:29,880
Yeah.

19
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:30,713
Yeah.

20
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:31,830
It's a sad story.

21
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:34,290
Tried to destroy the tracking device.

22
00:00:34,291 --> 00:00:34,740
Why?

23
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:35,860
Why do you try to distort a track?

24
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:38,340
Because he didn't want to people
to know that he killed this lion.

25
00:00:38,341 --> 00:00:39,780
That was a protected line.

26
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:43,530
Apparently they lured it away
from the protected area with the,

27
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:44,443
with meat,

28
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:46,530
it's still like drag meet behind a car.

29
00:00:46,531 --> 00:00:49,710
I like to put the sense so that this
thing would fall a scent and smell it.

30
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:52,550
And then he used a gps tracking
device to find the line.

31
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:53,130
No,

32
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:53,371
the,

33
00:00:53,371 --> 00:00:55,950
they found that allegedly
according to them,

34
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,550
they found out that it had a
tracking device after they killed it.

35
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:02,400
So they didn't know that
it was a protected lion.

36
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:04,043
Oh,

37
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:06,150
well is it going to do with the lion?

38
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:07,560
It's going to put it in his office.

39
00:01:07,561 --> 00:01:08,790
It just for the Instagram picture.

40
00:01:08,791 --> 00:01:11,940
That's why a lot of people were pissed
off because it's like this beloved lion,

41
00:01:11,941 --> 00:01:14,130
but yet they're only doing
it for like the photo,

42
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:14,700
you know.

43
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:15,090
Well,

44
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:16,320
he's got a trophy room,

45
00:01:16,321 --> 00:01:16,860
I think,

46
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,000
cause he's killed everything.

47
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:19,950
This guy's killed fucking everything.

48
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:20,310
Right.

49
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:22,650
I think Jimmy Kimmel said
he killed half a Noah's Ark.

50
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,560
Like literally it's fucked up.

51
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:28,380
Jimmy Kimmel start crying when he's
talking about it last night on TV.

52
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,030
And I think it was legit.

53
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:31,410
I know it was legit.

54
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:32,340
He's on a bullshit artist.

55
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:33,623
But um,

56
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:33,901
yeah,

57
00:01:33,901 --> 00:01:34,711
this guy's a,

58
00:01:34,711 --> 00:01:38,910
he's a one of those trophy hunters that
just wants to have these stuffed animals

59
00:01:38,911 --> 00:01:39,744
in a room.

60
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:40,700
Wow.

61
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:41,220
Ah,

62
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:41,521
you know,

63
00:01:41,521 --> 00:01:41,940
a big,

64
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:45,540
we talked about a big cat Derek
the other day and he had contacted,

65
00:01:45,541 --> 00:01:47,450
he wants to come out and fly out and uh,

66
00:01:47,451 --> 00:01:48,151
and be on the show,

67
00:01:48,151 --> 00:01:48,860
so when,

68
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:49,141
okay.

69
00:01:49,141 --> 00:01:49,381
Yeah,

70
00:01:49,381 --> 00:01:49,861
I'll definitely,

71
00:01:49,861 --> 00:01:50,251
I'm on.

72
00:01:50,251 --> 00:01:50,581
You know what,

73
00:01:50,581 --> 00:01:51,251
we should do the,

74
00:01:51,251 --> 00:01:51,991
he's one of those guys.

75
00:01:51,991 --> 00:01:52,824
We should go visit them.

76
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:53,250
Yeah.

77
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:54,450
In Texas you go to Texas.

78
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:54,840
Yeah.

79
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,160
So where was his line killing?

80
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,000
Uh,

81
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,930
it was in Africa,

82
00:01:57,931 --> 00:01:58,770
somewhere in Africa,

83
00:01:58,771 --> 00:02:00,180
which is a fucking huge place.

84
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:02,290
Somewhere in Africa is like
saying somewhere on earth.

85
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:03,420
I think it was in Zimbabwe.

86
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:04,140
Zimbabwe.

87
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:04,500
Yeah.

88
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,740
I want to know the two guys that dragged
it out knew that this was about love

89
00:02:07,741 --> 00:02:08,041
line.

90
00:02:08,041 --> 00:02:10,770
Obviously if it was such a
superhero in that that area,

91
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:11,670
like they,

92
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:13,680
it seems almost like a setup or something.

93
00:02:13,681 --> 00:02:17,700
I don't know how much of a superhero
line is the people that live there to the

94
00:02:17,701 --> 00:02:18,570
people that live there.

95
00:02:18,571 --> 00:02:19,780
That's a fucking mind.

96
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:20,530
You know,

97
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:24,870
I think a lot of the people that are
like conservationists and are people that

98
00:02:24,871 --> 00:02:28,980
are tourists and are visiting and that's
a love line that the beloved lion will

99
00:02:28,981 --> 00:02:29,814
kill you.

100
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:31,170
Just like any regular line.

101
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:31,890
It just not,

102
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:32,723
it's not the line.

103
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:36,280
Can you talk probably more mad at him
then the woman who killed the giraffe.

104
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:36,911
Ah,

105
00:02:36,911 --> 00:02:37,430
yeah.

106
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:37,621
Right.

107
00:02:37,621 --> 00:02:39,190
Cause there's no giraffe king.

108
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:40,343
No.

109
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:44,050
You know in that moment with Simba,

110
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:44,251
like,

111
00:02:44,251 --> 00:02:44,950
yeah,

112
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:48,200
I think we love lions a lot more
than giraffes don't yet think.

113
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:50,710
We love a lot of animals
based on cartoons.

114
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,090
We really do pay in cash.

115
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,750
We need a draft cartoon.

116
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:54,850
Yeah.

117
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:55,091
Oh,

118
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:55,960
toys r us.

119
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:57,150
They of have a draft,

120
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:58,660
but it's just a commercial we need.

121
00:02:59,080 --> 00:02:59,530
Yeah,

122
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:00,160
we

123
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,780
need like a real car town,

124
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:03,640
like a half hour seen.

125
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:06,910
You ever seen the video
of two giraffes fighting?

126
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:10,240
They like fight to the death
to male giraffes over breeding.

127
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:14,120
They use their next,

128
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:16,850
they use their head like a whip and they,

129
00:03:16,851 --> 00:03:17,161
they,

130
00:03:17,161 --> 00:03:19,960
they swing their neck into each other.

131
00:03:19,961 --> 00:03:21,640
It is fucking crazy.

132
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,320
And then they pull like tug of war.

133
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:23,861
No,

134
00:03:23,861 --> 00:03:26,920
they just slammed their
neck into each other's ass.

135
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:29,380
They slammed her neck
into each other's body.

136
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:29,771
You know,

137
00:03:29,771 --> 00:03:30,940
they have those like nubs,

138
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,541
like here it is.

139
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:33,850
Watch these dudes while
she's twos go to war.

140
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,121
Oh,

141
00:03:34,121 --> 00:03:35,440
we can see it on this
one in front of us here.

142
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,820
Watching students go to war.

143
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:38,080
They,

144
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:43,050
they slapped their bodies into
each other back and forth.

145
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:44,800
Come on.

146
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,670
How crazy is that?

147
00:03:45,671 --> 00:03:46,560
Oh my God,

148
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:47,511
they like whip.

149
00:03:47,511 --> 00:03:48,530
Put a wig on him.

150
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:51,430
Why would they put a wig on him?

151
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:52,743
Look cool.

152
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:54,220
Like hair,

153
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:55,630
like wailing everywhere.

154
00:03:55,631 --> 00:03:56,464
White Wig.

155
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:02,020
It's just a what?

156
00:04:02,021 --> 00:04:03,250
A crazy way to do battle.

157
00:04:03,251 --> 00:04:04,390
Don't they really have legs?

158
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:05,650
It's like sword fighting kind of.

159
00:04:05,651 --> 00:04:10,270
Then it's kind of cool if you were like
a giraffe and you were smart and you're

160
00:04:10,271 --> 00:04:10,421
like,

161
00:04:10,421 --> 00:04:10,851
okay,

162
00:04:10,851 --> 00:04:11,170
she would,

163
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:11,801
these guys are doing,

164
00:04:11,801 --> 00:04:12,880
I'm going to kick his legs,

165
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:14,521
kick him right in the fucking,

166
00:04:14,521 --> 00:04:14,800
oh yeah,

167
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,633
leg sweep it.

168
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,110
Just sweep the leg right there.

169
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:17,711
Yeah,

170
00:04:17,711 --> 00:04:17,881
that,

171
00:04:17,881 --> 00:04:17,961
that,

172
00:04:17,961 --> 00:04:19,480
that seems like I'll give
you a massive headache.

173
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:20,291
Oh yeah.

174
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:23,080
Well what they had one of them walk away.

175
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:23,591
This,

176
00:04:23,591 --> 00:04:24,251
these two guys,

177
00:04:24,251 --> 00:04:28,040
they went to war about it and they
walked away and his whole body,

178
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:28,960
it was fucked up.

179
00:04:28,961 --> 00:04:33,961
Like he had just massive open sores all
over his legs and his is open wounds all

180
00:04:34,361 --> 00:04:35,500
over his legs and body.

181
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,550
Cause those horns,

182
00:04:36,551 --> 00:04:37,540
they have their antlers.

183
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:39,070
They're slamming their antlers into,

184
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:40,450
into each other's bodies.

185
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:41,973
Bizarre.

186
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:43,750
Why did they get in a fight?

187
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:48,190
What do you think precipitated 100%
their fight over breeding rights?

188
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:49,101
No,

189
00:04:49,101 --> 00:04:49,241
no,

190
00:04:49,241 --> 00:04:49,391
no.

191
00:04:49,391 --> 00:04:51,070
They fight to make sure
that they can breed.

192
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:56,500
They fight like all a giraffe
essentially is like a type of deer.

193
00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:00,820
It's like an antelope or something so
that that kind of hooved animal and all

194
00:05:00,821 --> 00:05:01,511
those animals,

195
00:05:01,511 --> 00:05:05,290
they have real similar behavior and they
have similar behavior where they grow

196
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,750
the largest ones with the biggest antlers,

197
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:10,840
the ones that get to breed and they
clash heads to make sure that they're the

198
00:05:10,841 --> 00:05:11,471
bigger ones.

199
00:05:11,471 --> 00:05:14,740
And that's why they have these big
impressive antlers that's still at the

200
00:05:14,741 --> 00:05:15,281
females now.

201
00:05:15,281 --> 00:05:15,510
Like,

202
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:15,671
Oh,

203
00:05:15,671 --> 00:05:16,980
look at this mother fucker.

204
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:18,733
Yeah,

205
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,150
yeah.

206
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:22,270
The male giraffes get dark when giraffes,

207
00:05:22,271 --> 00:05:22,630
uh,

208
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:24,760
when they start dominating
the dominant male,

209
00:05:24,761 --> 00:05:25,810
like you could see them,

210
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:26,860
they stand out.

211
00:05:26,861 --> 00:05:28,570
They're actually darker
than the other ones

212
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:31,270
now.

213
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:32,103
You know?

214
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:35,471
But yeah,

215
00:05:35,471 --> 00:05:35,740
you,

216
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,720
you came here on a online day.

217
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:41,500
I mean I have my Twitter food feed has
never exploded like this over an animal.

218
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:42,543
It's very interesting.

219
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:43,140
Yeah.

220
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:44,580
It's all over Facebook.

221
00:05:44,581 --> 00:05:44,791
That,

222
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:45,790
and I'm also,

223
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:46,621
I've been scared.

224
00:05:46,621 --> 00:05:48,960
All my Facebook peeps are
scared about the hundred days,

225
00:05:48,961 --> 00:05:50,730
hundred nights thing
about the gang violence.

226
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:54,390
We no one really knows 100% for sure,

227
00:05:54,391 --> 00:05:56,290
but it's like the La Times has a,

228
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:56,521
you know,

229
00:05:56,521 --> 00:06:01,521
everyone's about it and it supposedly
these two that somebody died in a popular

230
00:06:01,851 --> 00:06:03,740
gang and uh,

231
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:08,950
supposedly the gangs to a rival gangs
decided to have a competition who can kill

232
00:06:09,261 --> 00:06:11,570
the most people in a
hundred days here in la.

233
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:16,130
And so it's up like a
Hashtag a hundred days,

234
00:06:16,131 --> 00:06:16,964
hundred nights.

235
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:19,700
And a lot of people are
calling bullshit on it.

236
00:06:19,701 --> 00:06:20,750
But who knows,

237
00:06:20,751 --> 00:06:21,080
you know?

238
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:21,670
No,

239
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:26,450
well it's the idea that we have so many
people that are in gangs and so many

240
00:06:26,451 --> 00:06:26,721
people,

241
00:06:26,721 --> 00:06:27,130
I mean,

242
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:30,230
you ever talked to one of those La gang
task force cars about how many gang

243
00:06:30,231 --> 00:06:31,130
members or are in la?

244
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:32,480
Every day falls me,

245
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,980
there's a lot of fucking gangs
and there's a lot of gang members,

246
00:06:36,981 --> 00:06:40,040
a lot of disenfranchised young people
that have nowhere to go criminal

247
00:06:40,041 --> 00:06:40,910
backgrounds.

248
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:41,541
Fuck,

249
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:42,500
can't get a job,

250
00:06:42,501 --> 00:06:43,071
can't vote,

251
00:06:43,071 --> 00:06:44,000
can't join the military.

252
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,193
It's everywhere.

253
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,840
I think a gangbanger
joined my high school,

254
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,470
like made high school.

255
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:50,463
Where'd you go to school?

256
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:51,521
East slide.

257
00:06:51,521 --> 00:06:52,354
In high school.

258
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:52,871
Where's that?

259
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:53,480
In Chicago.

260
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:53,811
Oh,

261
00:06:53,811 --> 00:06:54,680
you're from Chicago?

262
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:55,850
I'm from Chicago,

263
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:57,790
Ohio.

264
00:06:57,790 --> 00:06:58,551
What'd you start doing?

265
00:06:58,551 --> 00:07:00,680
Stand up Boston.

266
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:01,490
No Shit.

267
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:02,323
We're in Boston.

268
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,140
Uh,

269
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:05,210
the comedy studio in Harvard Square.

270
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:05,661
Oh,

271
00:07:05,661 --> 00:07:06,740
I didn't even know about that place.

272
00:07:06,741 --> 00:07:07,574
Where's that place?

273
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:08,630
No,

274
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:09,463
never heard of it.

275
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:10,323
Oh my God.

276
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,230
Is that the place above
the Chinese restaurant?

277
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:13,610
Yeah,

278
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:14,181
I have been there.

279
00:07:14,181 --> 00:07:14,441
Yeah,

280
00:07:14,441 --> 00:07:15,274
it was there.

281
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:16,670
That's where my first show was.

282
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:17,361
I got mad at me.

283
00:07:17,361 --> 00:07:21,170
They're some old guy got mad at me
for something I was talking about.

284
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:22,670
I forgot what I forgot what it's about.

285
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,090
Nobody got mad at me.

286
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,420
Mad At my subject matter.

287
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:31,450
The audience was laughing hard though.

288
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:31,911
Was fucked.

289
00:07:31,911 --> 00:07:32,481
It was weird.

290
00:07:32,481 --> 00:07:35,630
It's like this one guy just decided
that it wasn't fun in the wrong way,

291
00:07:35,631 --> 00:07:36,580
which is too personal.

292
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:38,810
I wish I could remember what it was,

293
00:07:38,811 --> 00:07:40,060
but I was just laughing like,

294
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,630
you really think I'm serious.

295
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:42,920
Like I forget what it was.

296
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:44,600
My might've been,

297
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:45,620
I'm not sure.

298
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:46,380
I'd be guessing.

299
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:47,061
Was he bigger than,

300
00:07:47,061 --> 00:07:47,810
you know,

301
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:48,643
it was not bigger than me.

302
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:50,443
He wants to start a fight.

303
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:51,620
I don't think you wanted to certify it.

304
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:55,630
I think you just wanted to
express just suggestion,

305
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,380
your suggestion box to your face.

306
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:59,570
It was really dumb because he was like,

307
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:02,240
like if you were at a show and
everybody else is enjoying it,

308
00:08:02,241 --> 00:08:04,850
it was all his laughter
and all this fun going on.

309
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:05,540
Then you're like,

310
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:05,871
no,

311
00:08:05,871 --> 00:08:08,990
you shouldn't be enjoying
this because I don't like it.

312
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:10,041
Like that's stupid.

313
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:10,730
Just leave.

314
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:11,470
You know?

315
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:13,580
I've had people tell me that like,

316
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,980
I would enjoy your act so much more if
you didn't use so many curse words or

317
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:22,040
didn't talk about like sex,

318
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:25,370
you know the whole time and I'm just like,

319
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:26,510
wait,

320
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:27,830
what do you want me to talk about?

321
00:08:27,831 --> 00:08:29,570
Like that's just what
I'm passionate about.

322
00:08:29,571 --> 00:08:31,130
Sometimes you're passionate about sex,

323
00:08:31,131 --> 00:08:31,964
it's beautiful.

324
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,153
It's just for days

325
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:40,640
now there's a lot of people they would
like to present that sex doesn't exist

326
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:41,930
because nobody wants to touch them.

327
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:43,790
There's a little bit of that going on.

328
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:47,240
There's a lot of that going on for sure.

329
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:50,400
But most people are
passionate about sex now.

330
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:51,201
There's a lot,

331
00:08:51,201 --> 00:08:54,530
but there's some people that don't like
you to talk about it and that's like New

332
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:54,560
England.

333
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,800
Like that area.

334
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,810
That's a big thing down there.

335
00:08:57,811 --> 00:09:01,200
Like that's a very buttoned down town and
the little very conservative and a lot

336
00:09:01,201 --> 00:09:06,150
of ways like everybody wears Khakis and
like blue collared shirts from j crew,

337
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:09,570
you know that's like the Boston uniform.

338
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:10,800
There is a lot of that going on.

339
00:09:10,801 --> 00:09:11,250
Yeah,

340
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:11,731
it's a very,

341
00:09:11,731 --> 00:09:14,370
because it's in a lot of
ways it's a liberal town,

342
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,300
a democratic town,

343
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:19,620
start comedy in because they're so tight
that you make them laugh and then you

344
00:09:19,621 --> 00:09:20,341
go somewhere it will be like,

345
00:09:20,341 --> 00:09:20,581
oh,

346
00:09:20,581 --> 00:09:21,600
this is so easy.

347
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:23,110
Those Boston people are so hard.

348
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:23,910
There's some,

349
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:24,990
some of them are tighten up,

350
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:25,291
tie in.

351
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:26,550
The other ones are mean and drunk.

352
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:31,710
So you got two good groups to
pull from the drunk Irish people.

353
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:32,360
Yeah.

354
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,050
Well it's a good spot to start that,

355
00:09:34,051 --> 00:09:34,290
that,

356
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:38,100
that Cambridge place was known
to be like a good little spot.

357
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:38,963
That's Rick Jenkins,

358
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:39,770
right?

359
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:40,071
Yeah.

360
00:09:40,071 --> 00:09:40,431
You know,

361
00:09:40,431 --> 00:09:41,360
I feel like he could,

362
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,100
he could have like a big comedy club.

363
00:09:43,101 --> 00:09:43,341
He like,

364
00:09:43,341 --> 00:09:45,440
he always prided himself
and not advertising.

365
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:46,131
He's like,

366
00:09:46,131 --> 00:09:47,870
we don't advertise it and look,

367
00:09:47,871 --> 00:09:50,930
there's still 20 people
here on a Saturday night.

368
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:51,921
And I'm like,

369
00:09:51,921 --> 00:09:53,230
you should advertise.

370
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:53,780
Like,

371
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:57,770
you can make so much money if you
like grew the club because yeah,

372
00:09:57,771 --> 00:09:58,850
it's been there for awhile.

373
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:01,490
People have very strange
ways of looking at things.

374
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:03,230
Then they just decided this is the way,

375
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:04,093
oh look,

376
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,120
I'm always aren't this way.

377
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:05,990
Right.

378
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:06,910
Not Advertising it.

379
00:10:06,911 --> 00:10:08,420
Comedy Club seems pretty silly.

380
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:10,580
Like how the fuck is
people were supposed to,

381
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:10,991
yeah.

382
00:10:10,991 --> 00:10:11,440
I mean,

383
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,221
he's here this week.

384
00:10:12,221 --> 00:10:12,701
Who knows?

385
00:10:12,701 --> 00:10:12,941
You know,

386
00:10:12,941 --> 00:10:14,260
like why would anyone go there?

387
00:10:14,261 --> 00:10:14,700
Right.

388
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:14,881
Yeah.

389
00:10:14,881 --> 00:10:15,930
That doesn't make any sense.

390
00:10:15,931 --> 00:10:16,764
But,

391
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,990
so how many people were out of there?

392
00:10:18,991 --> 00:10:21,990
There was this one gay dude that was
there that was really fucking funny.

393
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:23,970
Like really flamboyantly gay dude.

394
00:10:23,971 --> 00:10:25,260
He was hilarious.

395
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:26,730
I forget his name.

396
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,990
I want to say he's Iranian.

397
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:30,000
The calm person in Tripoli.

398
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:30,870
No,

399
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:31,703
he's not.

400
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:32,753
He's Armenian.

401
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:34,680
Um,

402
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,380
I forget his name.

403
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:37,090
K Do following them on
Twitter for a while.

404
00:10:37,091 --> 00:10:37,924
I lost track of him.

405
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:40,110
Saw him years back though.

406
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:42,770
He was very funny.

407
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:43,603
The comedy studio?

408
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:43,981
Yeah.

409
00:10:43,981 --> 00:10:44,814
From that spot.

410
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:45,841
Yeah.

411
00:10:45,841 --> 00:10:47,060
A lot of people came out of there,

412
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:49,600
but there's not that much besides there.

413
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,131
Right.

414
00:10:50,131 --> 00:10:50,491
I mean,

415
00:10:50,491 --> 00:10:52,070
what other places really grew open mind?

416
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:53,580
They still have open mic nights there.

417
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:54,533
I don't know.

418
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:55,360
You don't know?

419
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,080
You never go there?

420
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:56,771
I don't know.

421
00:10:56,771 --> 00:10:57,850
I haven't been there in awhile.

422
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:58,960
When did you start doing stand up?

423
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:00,080
Like I'm

424
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:02,823
10

425
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:04,183
10 years ago.

426
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:04,641
10,

427
00:11:04,641 --> 00:11:06,110
11 years ago.

428
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:06,411
Yeah.

429
00:11:06,411 --> 00:11:08,060
But I had a full time job when I started.

430
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:08,960
What were you doing?

431
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,460
I was a sales rep.

432
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:12,710
I was slinging pens,

433
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:13,663
pens,

434
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:14,211
kind of pen.

435
00:11:14,211 --> 00:11:14,740
You're holding?

436
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:15,080
Yeah.

437
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,080
That's why you were automatically,

438
00:11:16,081 --> 00:11:17,150
you like holding this pen,

439
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:19,040
like displaying it?

440
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:19,150
Yeah.

441
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:20,080
She has all the tricks.

442
00:11:20,081 --> 00:11:20,381
He knows.

443
00:11:20,381 --> 00:11:20,741
Let me see.

444
00:11:20,741 --> 00:11:21,574
Let me see your moves.

445
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:22,320
Well,

446
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,910
it's not really that hard while you do it.

447
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:25,570
Yeah.

448
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:26,403
Okay.

449
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:27,380
What are you doing?

450
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:28,600
You just going back and forth?

451
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:29,380
Yeah.

452
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:29,860
Okay.

453
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:30,880
I'm pretty sure I can do that.

454
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:32,343
Can I get a pen?

455
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,233
Okay.

456
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:35,410
Okay.

457
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:36,820
Let me see what you're
doing here this year.

458
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,650
How's that?

459
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:39,483
Yeah.

460
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:40,390
It doesn't seem that hard.

461
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:41,223
My doing it.

462
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:41,721
No.

463
00:11:41,721 --> 00:11:43,760
You have to get like the right balance.

464
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:45,283
This is amazing.

465
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,400
Everybody like in library students

466
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,410
college drum stick,

467
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:49,690
throwing the stick.

468
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:50,111
Oh,

469
00:11:50,111 --> 00:11:50,351
okay.

470
00:11:50,351 --> 00:11:50,800
It looks,

471
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,830
it looks cooler now.

472
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,111
No,

473
00:11:53,111 --> 00:11:53,711
you're doing it wrong.

474
00:11:53,711 --> 00:11:56,140
You have to do it between your
thumb and your index finger.

475
00:11:56,770 --> 00:11:58,450
Between your thumb and your index finger.

476
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:02,470
Put the bottom of the pen here
like in that little pocket,

477
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:03,463
right?

478
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:05,890
You have to place it here.

479
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:07,930
Oh,

480
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:09,460
there you have to put this here.

481
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,590
So what did you do you,

482
00:12:16,591 --> 00:12:18,790
you salon pens like you
used to go door to door,

483
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:20,050
like offices and stuff.

484
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,110
That's not how pens are sold these days.

485
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,120
Everybody says door to door

486
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:28,820
encyclopedia.

487
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:35,270
Have you ever bought a pen?

488
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,113
Give them samples

489
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:57,230
to everybody?

490
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:02,960
Yeah,

491
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:41,350
he gave me the best piece of advice
anybody ever gave me about driving.

492
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:45,760
He was driving back and forth from
Boston to New York and I said,

493
00:14:45,761 --> 00:14:47,170
how do you do it without going crazy?

494
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,560
When I sit in the car and I say,

495
00:14:51,561 --> 00:14:52,610
this is what I'm doing,

496
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:53,571
this is what I'm doing.

497
00:14:53,571 --> 00:14:54,170
I'm driving now.

498
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:55,100
I don't freak out.

499
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:55,911
I don't say,

500
00:14:55,911 --> 00:14:56,241
God,

501
00:14:56,241 --> 00:14:57,230
I wish I wasn't driving.

502
00:14:57,231 --> 00:14:58,670
How many more hours is there to go?

503
00:14:58,940 --> 00:14:59,401
I just say,

504
00:14:59,401 --> 00:15:00,290
this is what I'm doing,

505
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,251
and that's what I do.

506
00:15:01,251 --> 00:15:01,760
Now.

507
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,391
When I drive,

508
00:15:02,391 --> 00:15:02,751
I just say,

509
00:15:02,751 --> 00:15:03,584
this is what I'm doing.

512
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:11,410
More than one user

513
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:11,831
driving.

514
00:15:11,831 --> 00:15:12,980
I love to listen to music.

515
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:14,350
I have to listen to music,

516
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,040
have to,

517
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:15,820
I don't have to like,

518
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:17,770
I'll listen to like talk shows and stuff,

519
00:15:17,771 --> 00:15:19,390
but like something,

520
00:15:19,391 --> 00:15:22,380
it's just so powerful to
drive while playing meet,

521
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,800
but while blasting music,

522
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:24,611
you know,

523
00:15:24,611 --> 00:15:25,280

524
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,010
I just have like a party in my car.

525
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:29,160
I'm driving by myself and I'm like,

526
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:35,691
Jesus Christ.

527
00:15:35,691 --> 00:15:38,820
Why did you pick that
more of a Katy Perry?

528
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:44,840
Love Katy Perry.

529
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,580
That song was brutal.

530
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:50,680
I would like to introduce you to a
bunch of California girls are gross.

531
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,553
Yeah,

532
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:52,510
Monster.

533
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:55,840
I know all these California girls are
getting like the beach boys song too.

534
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:57,130
They get all this free publicity,

535
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:57,970
you know?

536
00:15:57,970 --> 00:15:58,340
Oh,

537
00:15:58,340 --> 00:15:58,980
could,

538
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:00,790
there's no song about Illinois girls.

539
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,433
There should be,

540
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:02,770
right?

541
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:03,040
No.

542
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:03,470
Yeah.

543
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:05,770
My girls are solid Texas girls.

544
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,330
Those are some solid girls,

545
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:08,110
right?

546
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:08,943
Yeah.

547
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:10,150
Texas origins girls,

548
00:16:10,151 --> 00:16:11,380
I think Texas.

549
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:11,631
Yeah.

550
00:16:11,631 --> 00:16:12,464
About Florida?

551
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:13,390
No.

552
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:15,910
If you want to know what
daisy that a worshiper land,

553
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:17,110
if you want to buy pills.

554
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:17,380
No,

555
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:18,213
all them,

556
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:19,480
all of them are coke heads.

557
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,400
All of the Florida girls.

558
00:16:21,401 --> 00:16:26,350
It seems like that's probably the
state is between Florida and Arizona.

559
00:16:26,351 --> 00:16:27,071
It's the state.

560
00:16:27,071 --> 00:16:28,000
We can guarantee if you go,

561
00:16:28,001 --> 00:16:29,200
I'm going to run into people coked up.

562
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:29,950
Oh yeah,

563
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:31,450
those are these two spots

564
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:33,440
I find coke.

565
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:33,921
Yeah.

566
00:16:33,921 --> 00:16:34,390
You know what,

567
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:34,700
that,

568
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:37,790
that did happen to me at a show in
Florida once somebody offered you these

569
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:38,241
girls,

570
00:16:38,241 --> 00:16:38,810
they were all like,

571
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:39,530
you know,

572
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:41,930
dressed out like dress like they're
going to the club or something,

573
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:42,531
you know,

574
00:16:42,531 --> 00:16:42,891
and they,

575
00:16:42,891 --> 00:16:43,724
after a show,

576
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:46,370
it was a comedy show in
a barbershop in Wynwood.

577
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:47,750
And after the show,

578
00:16:47,751 --> 00:16:48,531
these girls came up to me.

579
00:16:48,531 --> 00:16:48,711
They're like,

580
00:16:48,711 --> 00:16:49,544
yeah,

581
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:51,840
you know,

582
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:52,673
they're like,

583
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:53,181
come,

584
00:16:53,181 --> 00:16:53,451
come,

585
00:16:53,451 --> 00:16:53,910
come.

586
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:58,590
And they like brought me to the bathroom
and they pull out a key with coke on it

587
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:01,230
and were like handing it to me to be nice,

588
00:17:01,231 --> 00:17:01,651
I guess.

589
00:17:01,651 --> 00:17:03,690
Like let her have the
first sniff and I was like,

590
00:17:03,691 --> 00:17:04,021
no,

591
00:17:04,021 --> 00:17:04,854
I don't.

592
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:05,851
I'm like,

593
00:17:05,851 --> 00:17:06,720
I don't do that.

594
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,071
Then the hate,

595
00:17:08,071 --> 00:17:09,420
you know,

596
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:09,970
turn on.

597
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:10,740
Yeah.

598
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:11,221
Did they,

599
00:17:11,221 --> 00:17:12,054
I don't remember.

600
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:13,410
She took it for coke.

601
00:17:13,411 --> 00:17:13,591
I mean,

602
00:17:13,591 --> 00:17:14,790
why would you turn down coke?

603
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:16,430
Wow.

604
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:17,263
Yeah.

605
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:18,810
Coke is fun.

606
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:19,700
You don't know.

607
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:20,670
You've done coke before.

608
00:17:20,671 --> 00:17:21,504
You've had a

609
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:28,330
you twitch and like not stop talking and
I just start freaking out like I'm on

610
00:17:28,701 --> 00:17:29,534
too much coffee.

611
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:30,070
You know,

612
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:30,731
I never did it,

613
00:17:30,731 --> 00:17:32,110
but I did drink the tea.

614
00:17:32,111 --> 00:17:34,210
I drink this tea called Mata de Coco.

615
00:17:34,211 --> 00:17:37,210
It's made out of cocoa leaves
and I couldn't shut the fuck up.

616
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:40,540
I did it with a Stan hope and
I remember I kept telling him,

617
00:17:40,541 --> 00:17:40,841
dude,

618
00:17:40,841 --> 00:17:42,220
I can't shut the fuck up.

619
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:43,150
This is driving me crazy.

620
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:44,380
And you're aware of it?

621
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:44,591
Yeah,

622
00:17:44,591 --> 00:17:45,191
it's terrible.

623
00:17:45,191 --> 00:17:46,270
It's the worst drug for me.

624
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:48,090
It's horrible because it's like,

625
00:17:48,091 --> 00:17:50,150
it's the are like escaping.

626
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,700
It makes you stay up so
late that it does that.

627
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:55,410
Like you're just the whole next
two days that are just wasted.

628
00:17:55,411 --> 00:17:57,420
You can't be productive with anything.

629
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:58,271
Yeah.

630
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:01,180
I have a friend who just did
ecstasy and he said the same thing,

631
00:18:01,181 --> 00:18:02,170
said after it was over,

632
00:18:02,171 --> 00:18:04,750
like the next day he felt so shitty.

633
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:05,621
He's like,

634
00:18:05,621 --> 00:18:05,910
I could,

635
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:06,743
he couldn't do anything.

636
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,490
There's a way to do ecstasy,

637
00:18:08,491 --> 00:18:09,090
right?

638
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:09,810
New Mood,

639
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:11,940
take a shit load of new
mood before you go to bed.

640
00:18:11,941 --> 00:18:16,170
Just see like vitamin C and that's one
of those things where you can do it

641
00:18:16,171 --> 00:18:16,621
correctly.

642
00:18:16,621 --> 00:18:17,070
And I've known,

643
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:19,680
I've had it where I've woken up
and hadn't to zero hangovers.

644
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:20,563
And he's really funny

645
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,300
fit though.

646
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:24,000
And I wonder if the
difference between a guy that,

647
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:24,510
uh,

648
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:27,600
is like always working out and eating
healthy and drinks a lot of water and

649
00:18:27,601 --> 00:18:28,470
takes care of his body.

650
00:18:28,471 --> 00:18:32,910
Like the kind of heat when he really
feels like a shitty day or as you booze it

651
00:18:32,911 --> 00:18:34,050
up all the time,

652
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,070
you're smoking all the time.

653
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:35,471
We got some.

654
00:18:35,471 --> 00:18:35,630
Okay.

655
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:35,991
Anymore,

656
00:18:35,991 --> 00:18:36,250
right?

657
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:37,060
Well I'm still off.

658
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:38,830
I kind of fucked up in Toronto.

659
00:18:38,831 --> 00:18:40,390
So are you back on now?

660
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:41,770
I'm just not,

661
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:43,270
I'm just having a few a day now.

662
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,820
Thank smoking cigarettes.

663
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:45,290
Yeah,

664
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:45,920
Brian,

665
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:46,770
I can,

666
00:18:46,771 --> 00:18:48,120
have you ever tried to be hypnotized?

667
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:49,851
No,

668
00:18:49,851 --> 00:18:50,960
I that doesn't work on me.

669
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:51,441
No,

670
00:18:51,441 --> 00:18:52,350
it will work dude.

671
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:53,390
You just got to get a real person.

672
00:18:53,391 --> 00:18:54,260
I get people that say that.

673
00:18:54,261 --> 00:18:54,980
Read that book.

674
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:55,221
No,

675
00:18:55,221 --> 00:19:00,110
I hate reading books so much that
like fuck this book and everything.

676
00:19:00,111 --> 00:19:01,040
It stands for.

677
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,173
Books are awesome.

678
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:03,620
It's just wasting my time.

679
00:19:03,621 --> 00:19:03,910
Like I,

680
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:05,120
I look at a book and I'm like,

681
00:19:05,121 --> 00:19:05,470
I,

682
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:06,920
I'm thinking like a million things.

683
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:09,710
Other things that's like when you
say you're in the car playing music,

684
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:12,830
I'll drive and sometimes realize that I'm
not even listening to anything cause I

685
00:19:12,831 --> 00:19:17,360
have a million things I'm at thinking
about like I'm multitasking all over the

686
00:19:17,361 --> 00:19:17,750
place.

687
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:20,660
So you can't read a book because you
can't concentrate enough to read a book.

688
00:19:20,661 --> 00:19:20,841
I mean,

689
00:19:20,841 --> 00:19:23,390
I can read a book and make myself
concentrate to read a book.

690
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:24,790
You never sit down and read a book.

691
00:19:24,791 --> 00:19:25,940
He never like read the finishing.

692
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:28,340
Not since the Internet was
made cause I read the Internet.

693
00:19:28,341 --> 00:19:28,970
Yeah,

694
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:29,790
eyes are bad.

695
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:30,710
Deteriorate my,

696
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:32,210
I like 10 years.

697
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:34,940
I have to like give your eyes a break.

698
00:19:34,941 --> 00:19:35,480
Jesus.

699
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,313
I read a Stephen,

700
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:40,160
I read a Stephen King and we're going to
be doing a benefit for him in 10 years.

701
00:19:40,161 --> 00:19:43,910
Like please help save Brian redbands eyes.

702
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:46,250
You know the surgery costs don't you

703
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:48,260
really close to some artificial lens.

704
00:19:48,261 --> 00:19:50,030
Did you see that thing that they
had on the Internet recently?

705
00:19:50,031 --> 00:19:52,670
They are creating some artificial
lens for the human eye.

706
00:19:52,671 --> 00:19:54,540
That's way better than
any vision [inaudible]

707
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,433
you'll ever have.

708
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:56,641
I thought they already had that.

709
00:19:56,641 --> 00:19:57,920
Didn't they have their first implant?

710
00:19:58,010 --> 00:19:58,790
I don't know,

711
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:02,090
but there's some new one that they've
developed some artificial lens.

712
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:03,410
See if you can find it,

713
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:04,460
but they,

714
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:05,930
there was some talk about it.

715
00:20:05,931 --> 00:20:06,261
They were like,

716
00:20:06,261 --> 00:20:07,640
why would you Catlins no,

717
00:20:07,641 --> 00:20:09,800
it's going to be like something
they insert into your eyes.

718
00:20:09,801 --> 00:20:10,430
Your eye.

719
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:10,760
Yeah.

720
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:11,900
They're going to do surgery on you.

721
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:13,330
What do you think about?

722
00:20:13,331 --> 00:20:16,900
What do you think about people who
want to put chips and kids to prevent

723
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:19,870
kidnappings or to be
able to find your kid?

724
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:23,700
It sounds like a great idea
if that's what it does.

725
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,900
If it prevents kidnapping
and so he could find new kid.

726
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:30,360
The problem comes when people
use it for other reasons,

727
00:20:30,361 --> 00:20:35,361
like to know where your kids are because
I don't like you or to know where your

728
00:20:36,391 --> 00:20:38,100
kid is when they become an adult.

729
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:41,400
Maybe someone doesn't like their opinion
on something or maybe they're about to

730
00:20:41,401 --> 00:20:44,550
expose some business corruption
or government corruption.

731
00:20:44,551 --> 00:20:46,170
When people know where
they are at all times,

732
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:47,950
that seems fucked up.

733
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:52,480
It just seems fucked up because we can't
quite track everything that everybody

734
00:20:52,481 --> 00:20:53,020
does.

735
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:55,780
I think eventually we'll be able to
track everything everybody does all the

736
00:20:55,781 --> 00:20:56,310
time.

737
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:58,630
Like this is radio lab
show called eye in the sky.

738
00:20:58,660 --> 00:20:59,190
What is this?

739
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:00,090
The implant is that,

740
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:00,760
what does it say?

741
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,593
It's treated.

742
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,160
Uh,

743
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:06,010
BC optometrist sees way
for bionic Lens and plant.

744
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:10,030
Imagine seeing three times
better than 2020 vision.

745
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:12,130
Even at the age of a hundred or more.

746
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:14,950
That's the future.

747
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:18,220
So this radio lab podcast
called the eye in the sky,

748
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:18,700
uh,

749
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:18,911
is,

750
00:21:18,911 --> 00:21:20,110
I think that's the name of the episode.

751
00:21:20,111 --> 00:21:21,880
And it's all about these,

752
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:26,290
this technology they developed that they
put on planes and they fly these planes

753
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:30,790
overhead and they take detailed
images of everything on the ground.

754
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,530
So they do it like click,

755
00:21:32,531 --> 00:21:32,831
click,

756
00:21:32,831 --> 00:21:33,101
click,

757
00:21:33,101 --> 00:21:34,750
like it's constantly as it's flying,

758
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:36,490
taking millions and millions of photos.

759
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:38,200
So if something happens,

760
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:41,620
what they can do is find out where
it happened when it happened,

761
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:45,280
then go to the eye in the sky footage
that go to that section of the footage.

762
00:21:45,281 --> 00:21:45,521
They go,

763
00:21:45,521 --> 00:21:46,240
okay,

764
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,100
let's take it to three 30 today.

765
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:48,520
Yup.

766
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,390
There's the car,

767
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:51,130
there's the guy who gets out of the car,

768
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:52,360
there's a guy getting shot.

769
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:53,920
The guy gets back in
the car and drives off.

770
00:21:53,921 --> 00:21:56,200
Let's find out where the cargo
is and they just follow the car.

771
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:56,660
They,

772
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:59,740
so they have all the images of everything
that's happening and they're going to

773
00:21:59,741 --> 00:22:03,490
use this in places like Iraq and they're
going to try to use this in places like

774
00:22:03,491 --> 00:22:07,480
Detroit and places where there's a
lot of crime and a lot of violence,

775
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:08,531
but you know,

776
00:22:08,531 --> 00:22:10,780
people are resisting it obviously
because they're going to,

777
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:12,410
they're going to catch people
doing all kinds of stuff.

778
00:22:12,411 --> 00:22:14,770
They're going to catch people cheating
on their wives and their husbands are

779
00:22:14,771 --> 00:22:16,470
going to catch people stealing from work.

780
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,640
They're going to catch
people not feeling like work.

781
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:18,911
Yeah.

782
00:22:18,911 --> 00:22:19,570
Fill in the blank.

783
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:21,550
You say you're here but you're there.

784
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:23,080
Someone's going to have access to it.

785
00:22:23,081 --> 00:22:24,730
You said you couldn't
work because of this,

786
00:22:24,731 --> 00:22:26,320
but we have footage of you at home.

787
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:28,300
It's just gets weird.

788
00:22:28,301 --> 00:22:32,080
It gets weird when someone can just
find where you are all the time.

789
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:34,630
But it kind of seems like
that's where it's going.

790
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:36,460
It kind of seems right there.

791
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,393
Yeah,

792
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:38,500
almost.

793
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:38,970
Yeah.

794
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:39,660
You know,

795
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:43,830
like my problem with like putting
chips in kids is that like,

796
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:44,191
okay,

797
00:22:44,191 --> 00:22:44,630
so the,

798
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:46,530
it'll prevent people from predators,

799
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:47,580
from the kidnapping kids,

800
00:22:47,581 --> 00:22:48,001
whatever.

801
00:22:48,001 --> 00:22:53,001
But what if he finds where the chip
is and then like scrapes it up.

802
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:54,961
You know what I mean?

803
00:22:54,961 --> 00:22:58,650
Like he could hurt the child if
it's like implanted in their skin.

804
00:22:59,080 --> 00:22:59,831
That's true.

805
00:22:59,831 --> 00:23:03,370
But I don't think you're going to save
that kid by not having it in their skin

806
00:23:03,371 --> 00:23:06,610
when he's going to fuck the kid and kill
him or whatever the hell he's going to

807
00:23:06,611 --> 00:23:06,990
do.

808
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:07,420
Yeah.

809
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:08,020
You know what I mean?

810
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:08,860
I see what you're saying.

811
00:23:08,861 --> 00:23:10,420
Like someone would want to cut it out,

812
00:23:10,421 --> 00:23:11,740
but if they could find it,

813
00:23:11,741 --> 00:23:14,710
it's kind of person who would cut an
implant out of a kid is not planning on

814
00:23:14,711 --> 00:23:15,131
doing,

815
00:23:15,131 --> 00:23:15,690
you know?

816
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:15,880
Well,

817
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:16,511
other than that,

818
00:23:16,511 --> 00:23:18,850
my intentions are completely altruistic.

819
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:21,110
I fucking hate chips.

820
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:23,680
I just have to cut the
chip out of this kid.

821
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:25,540
You're dealing with it.

822
00:23:25,541 --> 00:23:29,200
So it's a weird privacy issue that I
think eventually it's going to get to a

823
00:23:29,201 --> 00:23:29,401
point,

824
00:23:29,401 --> 00:23:33,040
it was going to be a moot point because
there's going to be so much access to

825
00:23:33,041 --> 00:23:34,300
where everybody is all the time.

826
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:35,650
It's going to be pointless.

827
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:35,781
Well,

828
00:23:35,781 --> 00:23:35,960
like

829
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:38,330
these cameras are just
getting more and more HD.

830
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:40,850
But like you'll be up to like just take,

831
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:41,631
take out your phone,

832
00:23:41,631 --> 00:23:45,590
take a picture and like you're in line
at Starbucks or whatever and pulls out

833
00:23:45,591 --> 00:23:46,070
their credit card

834
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:46,401
to pay.

835
00:23:46,401 --> 00:23:49,400
You'll be able to take a picture and
then just know that that person's whole

836
00:23:49,401 --> 00:23:50,240
credit card number,

837
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:51,510
you know,

838
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:53,840
like you're going to be
able to zoom in so much.

839
00:23:53,841 --> 00:23:57,530
Like this thing is going to get
more and more spreading the fingers.

840
00:23:57,650 --> 00:23:58,483
Yeah.

841
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,550
They used that um,

842
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:05,790
are in the sky thing in Juarez to
catch this man who had killed this,

843
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:11,420
a female police officer that shot this
female police officer or may or something

844
00:24:11,421 --> 00:24:11,990
like that,

845
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:14,180
some female person in charge.

846
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:16,940
And when they shot her,

847
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:21,110
they followed the car back to this house
and then they backed up and they were

848
00:24:21,111 --> 00:24:23,420
able to follow all these other
cars back to the house too.

849
00:24:23,421 --> 00:24:28,340
And it turns out this is his house that
was filled with a drug cartel members

850
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:33,640
and they were hit men and they would
just run around doing murders and robbing

851
00:24:34,131 --> 00:24:36,140
people and they were all
hold up in this one house,

852
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:37,040
like a fucking movie.

853
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:39,650
And so they just stormed the
house and arrested everybody.

854
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:42,890
So they're trying to use it as like one
of those things where the saying that

855
00:24:42,891 --> 00:24:46,570
this is eventually going to be something
that comes in very handy and it's going

856
00:24:46,571 --> 00:24:47,300
to be everywhere.

857
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:49,520
How's that eye in the
sky deal with clouds?

858
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:51,740
Like if it's like an Ohio
could be cloudy for a week.

859
00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:52,701
It's a good question.

860
00:24:52,701 --> 00:24:55,880
I mean they probably fly
under the crowds if possible.

861
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:57,343
If not,

862
00:24:57,530 --> 00:24:58,730
there's probably nothing they could do.

863
00:24:59,120 --> 00:24:59,660
Yeah.

864
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:03,500
So if you're going to want be at the
farriers criminal live in Ohio in the

865
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:03,501
winter,

866
00:25:03,501 --> 00:25:04,100
cloudy day.

867
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:04,933
Yeah,

868
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,003
it's a good point.

869
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:08,540
You could just put those chips,

870
00:25:08,541 --> 00:25:08,980
you know,

871
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:12,230
and the kids putting them on their
Dicks of a kidnapper takes the baby.

872
00:25:12,231 --> 00:25:14,450
They're not going to ruin the best
part of the baby that you know.

873
00:25:14,451 --> 00:25:15,800
And that guy cut the dick out,

874
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:16,241
Brian.

875
00:25:16,241 --> 00:25:18,510
I'm like put it in the Dick Hall.

876
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:21,870
Best part of the baby.

877
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:24,780
It's already show cars.

878
00:25:24,781 --> 00:25:25,770
Gonna fuck up the good.

879
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:27,420
Think about that before you said it.

880
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:28,171
Did you go,

881
00:25:28,171 --> 00:25:29,550
this is the good thing to say right now.

882
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:30,930
This is perfect.

883
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:32,070
This is going to be awesome.

884
00:25:32,071 --> 00:25:33,150
Everyone's gonna enjoy this show.

885
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:35,280
Everybody thinks like me.

886
00:25:35,281 --> 00:25:36,114
This is perfect.

887
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,620
What did you,

888
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:39,970
we talked briefly last
night about that alien,

889
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:40,950
that CIA,

890
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:44,260
it's just hilarious story.

891
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,370
It's a really interesting,

892
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:47,410
and if you listen to the interview of the,

893
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:49,630
supposedly this guy died,

894
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:53,680
they found him in an SUV in the
Pacific Palisades and he was,

895
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:55,540
had been there I guess for four days.

896
00:25:55,570 --> 00:26:00,570
And what happened is his girlfriend knew
that he died and thought he was a half

897
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:06,040
a hybrid of an alien and a a CIA agent.

898
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:06,881
So he thought,

899
00:26:06,881 --> 00:26:08,920
she thought she better leave the body.

900
00:26:08,921 --> 00:26:10,600
The government knows he's dead.

901
00:26:10,601 --> 00:26:10,900
He'll,

902
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:13,900
they'll take care of the body because
he's not supposed to know it exists type

903
00:26:13,901 --> 00:26:14,410
thing.

904
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:17,170
So went up to Washington and uh,

905
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:17,980
they,

906
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:19,630
the cops found the body.

907
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:21,970
He's been there forever
and they go into his house.

908
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:24,670
He has millions of dollars worth of guns.

909
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,940
And then he also has large
amounts of cash everywhere.

910
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:29,493
That's what they're saying.

911
00:26:29,810 --> 00:26:31,250
Thousand 200 guns.

912
00:26:31,251 --> 00:26:32,310
It's not millions of dollars.

913
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:35,020
They said last night on the
news that it was a a collection.

914
00:26:35,021 --> 00:26:35,854
We're chameleons

915
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:38,270
a million if each guy is worth 1000 bucks.

916
00:26:38,271 --> 00:26:38,710
Right?

917
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:42,520
I guess some of them are just really
like antiques I collectors and stuff like

918
00:26:42,521 --> 00:26:42,760
that.

919
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:46,890
It's like huge collection so it doesn't
look like he's like was a broke,

920
00:26:46,891 --> 00:26:47,311
broke,

921
00:26:47,311 --> 00:26:48,144
right?

922
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:51,030
And $230,000 in cash.

923
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:54,060
14 vehicles stashed around Los Angeles.

924
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:56,910
14 vehicles registered to him,

925
00:26:56,970 --> 00:26:59,270
including an SUV designed
to drive under water.

926
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:03,600
He's a nut and the SUV
to drive under the water.

927
00:27:03,601 --> 00:27:05,650
It's something that this new ABC seven,

928
00:27:05,651 --> 00:27:08,790
it's just blowing up a portion that's
actually a common thing that you put on

929
00:27:08,791 --> 00:27:09,780
the bottom of the SUV.

930
00:27:09,781 --> 00:27:12,060
So when you run over a puddle
as it doesn't flood out,

931
00:27:12,061 --> 00:27:13,350
the engine will sort of,

932
00:27:13,351 --> 00:27:13,621
it's not,

933
00:27:13,621 --> 00:27:14,580
you don't put it on the bottom,

934
00:27:14,581 --> 00:27:15,450
it's a snorkel,

935
00:27:15,451 --> 00:27:17,730
it goes out the the front fender.

936
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:18,120
Right.

937
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,530
It's real common for uh,

938
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:22,980
like off road vehicles like Lang Rovers,

939
00:27:22,981 --> 00:27:23,920
like defenders,

940
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:25,260
those Land Rover defenders.

941
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:28,350
So that thing with a big pipe tube
that comes off the side of the car,

942
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:29,330
you seem in jeep,

943
00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:31,770
sometimes a Toyota land cruisers,

944
00:27:31,771 --> 00:27:33,180
a lot of times they
hooked those up with them.

945
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:34,260
People just like it.

946
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:35,730
They like the fact they could just,

947
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:36,221
I could float,

948
00:27:36,221 --> 00:27:38,580
can drive underwater
bitch play this video.

949
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,360
I want to hear this

950
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,193
Jamie.

951
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,300
1200 guns.

952
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,193
That seems a little,

953
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,720
a little excessive commercial,

954
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,033
uh,

955
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:48,683
by,

956
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:50,143
uh,

957
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:53,850
they haven't really released a picture
of him or any news and he's had prior

958
00:27:53,851 --> 00:27:55,500
convictions where he's gotten off,

959
00:27:55,770 --> 00:27:59,790
but where you could only get it off if
you were like somebody that works high up

960
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:00,210
like,

961
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:00,420
well,

962
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:01,253
you mean arrest?

963
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:02,791
He had a gun,

964
00:28:02,791 --> 00:28:04,200
I believe at lax or something.

965
00:28:04,201 --> 00:28:07,500
There's a lot of message boards that
are really digging into this guy and

966
00:28:07,501 --> 00:28:11,550
finding all this interesting stuff that
he register all these guns under him.

967
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:12,661
That's what it looks like.

968
00:28:12,661 --> 00:28:15,330
It was all somehow done with hair.

969
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,690
Body of a man is found near
he's Pacific Palisades home.

970
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:19,793
That was stuff that,

971
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:24,800
especially the weapons during a story
connected to the disappearance of an ox

972
00:28:24,801 --> 00:28:25,634
starred a woman.

973
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:27,360
Because I was doing more low all night.

974
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:28,350
Sure.

975
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:28,711
Panelists,

976
00:28:28,711 --> 00:28:31,620
age with a man's body was found
abandoned and decomposing.

977
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:33,180
Very Nasal Carlos.

978
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:35,291
Well,

979
00:28:35,291 --> 00:28:37,480
this is definitely a very straight scotch.

980
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:38,281
The man was found.

981
00:28:38,281 --> 00:28:42,010
The guys are drinking scotch or his
fiance's home in Pacific Palisades.

982
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:46,990
Nice House who was missing work for the
fiance and other wild stories at the man

983
00:28:46,991 --> 00:28:51,640
was a secret government agent and
possibly part alien from outer space.

984
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:53,290
Wait a minute from out of space,

985
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,153
not Mexican.

986
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:56,670
I shut them down.

987
00:28:56,680 --> 00:29:00,010
Is decomposing body in
his SUV inside the home.

988
00:29:00,011 --> 00:29:01,330
A huge cache of weapons.

989
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:02,711
Aussie.

990
00:29:02,711 --> 00:29:04,390
Aussie has an amazing story.

991
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:07,350
A story her attorney
found a bit far fetched.

992
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:09,430
Thought he was crazy.

993
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:10,930
It sounded crazy to me.

994
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:11,931
Catherine Nub.

995
00:29:11,931 --> 00:29:16,390
Ron Claims Lash actually died two weeks
earlier on July 4th in a parking lot in

996
00:29:16,391 --> 00:29:17,224
Santa Monica.

997
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:19,810
Nebar on say she and the
missing Oxnard woman,

998
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:23,620
Dawn Vad bunker tried to save his life
and they work for about three hours

999
00:29:23,621 --> 00:29:24,760
trying to keep him alive.

1000
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:26,950
He refused nine one one.

1001
00:29:26,951 --> 00:29:28,540
He didn't want to go
to the emergency room.

1002
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:30,250
He didn't want any police,

1003
00:29:30,251 --> 00:29:31,300
so he died there.

1004
00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:31,681
Neb.

1005
00:29:31,681 --> 00:29:34,780
Ron says she then took him back
to his home and left him there.

1006
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:39,790
She believed that he was involved
in some surreptitious activities,

1007
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,410
governmental projects,

1008
00:29:41,411 --> 00:29:42,244
whatever,

1009
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:45,640
and so her instructions were
that if anything happened to him,

1010
00:29:45,730 --> 00:29:46,151
they,

1011
00:29:46,151 --> 00:29:46,990
whatever they is,

1012
00:29:46,991 --> 00:29:48,100
we'll take care of the body.

1013
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:51,190
Favorite being watched all the time.

1014
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:53,890
I was told they were being
watched all the time.

1015
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:57,070
I was told or house was
being watched all the time.

1016
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:59,470
Never on an bad or claim.

1017
00:29:59,471 --> 00:30:02,400
They traveled bunker to Oregon
to forget about what happened.

1018
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:06,270
Never on returned two weeks later
and was stunned at what she found.

1019
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:07,310
When she got back.

1020
00:30:08,570 --> 00:30:11,840
The body was still in the car and that's
when she decided she better call a

1021
00:30:11,841 --> 00:30:12,580
lawyer.

1022
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:15,490
Ron says when he thought
the police had guns,

1023
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:20,440
six and a half tons of
ammunition and $230,000 in cash.

1024
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:23,650
That bunker was found alive
and well in a motel in Oregon.

1025
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:24,371
Meanwhile,

1026
00:30:24,371 --> 00:30:25,001
vet bunkers.

1027
00:30:25,001 --> 00:30:27,850
Mother adds another
twist about Jeffrey Lash.

1028
00:30:28,090 --> 00:30:31,930
We were all told that he
was half alien ass man.

1029
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:36,130
He was here to save the world
and he was higher than a CIA.

1030
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:38,110
Special labs for the government.

1031
00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:43,120
What detectives are now
working on the downturn?

1032
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:48,500
This is actually on the news and checking
to see if anyone else has said at

1033
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:51,120
least sketch Pacific.

1034
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:52,410
Now you don't have any pictures,

1035
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:53,341
no pictures,

1036
00:30:53,341 --> 00:30:54,031
no photos,

1037
00:30:54,031 --> 00:30:55,080
but at least get a drawing.

1038
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:58,890
There's one drawing that looks a lot
like will Smith for men and black too.

1039
00:31:00,810 --> 00:31:05,070
It's so stupid that all you have to do
is have some guns and some cash and a

1040
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:06,960
stupid story and you'll make the news.

1041
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:08,880
I mean that's really what this is about.

1042
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:12,060
This is really about guns
and k oddly no contest.

1043
00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:14,250
All we know is he was involved.

1044
00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:14,430
No,

1045
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:15,120
you don't know anything.

1046
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:15,661
This is what you know.

1047
00:31:15,661 --> 00:31:18,180
You got guns and you've got
cash and you've got a dead dude.

1048
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:19,380
And because of that,

1049
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,370
everybody is getting crazy.

1050
00:31:20,371 --> 00:31:21,600
That half alien dude,

1051
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,580
like if you only have like five guns,

1052
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:24,181
who would be like,

1053
00:31:24,181 --> 00:31:27,150
well he was a gun enthusiast
and if you had 20 guns,

1054
00:31:27,151 --> 00:31:27,631
people were like,

1055
00:31:27,631 --> 00:31:30,960
well what was he planning
when you have 1,200 guns,

1056
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:31,950
then you're on TV.

1057
00:31:32,010 --> 00:31:32,970
You didn't make the news.

1058
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:36,750
And what's weird is that
most gun collectors don't
usually have ammo for all the

1059
00:31:36,751 --> 00:31:38,760
weapons because they never plan on firing.

1060
00:31:38,761 --> 00:31:41,160
And they are these guns and
he had ammo for all this.

1061
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:42,850
I don't think he was a,

1062
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:43,471
oh,

1063
00:31:43,471 --> 00:31:45,480
he's suffering from late stage cancer.

1064
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:48,240
I don't think that's um,

1065
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:50,910
he's a collector as far as he's,

1066
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,620
I mean he's got all those guns,

1067
00:31:52,621 --> 00:31:56,370
but it's not like he's got them in
cases like this is Christopher Columbus.

1068
00:31:56,371 --> 00:32:00,210
He must get anybody with a last name lash.

1069
00:32:00,930 --> 00:32:02,680
I know it sounds like
the terminator movie,

1070
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:05,160
her real name and her name
was bunker in that picture.

1071
00:32:05,161 --> 00:32:05,581
Like what,

1072
00:32:05,581 --> 00:32:06,060
what?

1073
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:07,440
Scroll back up to that picture Jamie.

1074
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:09,210
What does it no down?

1075
00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:10,140
Yeah.

1076
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:11,430
Lash on thousand fires.

1077
00:32:11,431 --> 00:32:14,790
14 specially equipped
cars among other strange,

1078
00:32:14,791 --> 00:32:15,624
unusual items.

1079
00:32:15,810 --> 00:32:19,440
So what does that is like work bench in
there and look at all the piles of cash.

1080
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:23,460
I mean in all they're saying all
the cars were specially equipped,

1081
00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:23,761
you know,

1082
00:32:23,761 --> 00:32:24,750
like with weird things.

1083
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:25,613
So He's a nut.

1084
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,240
He's probably one of those preppers.

1085
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:31,710
It's just amazing that this can actually
become a story just because you have to

1086
00:32:31,711 --> 00:32:33,000
catch a movie out of it.

1087
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:34,103
Yeah.

1088
00:32:34,170 --> 00:32:34,720
Are there any,

1089
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,030
who's going to play less?

1090
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:37,410
This is priority a movie,

1091
00:32:37,411 --> 00:32:38,120
right?

1092
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:38,520
Um,

1093
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,380
Christian Bale.

1094
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:42,133
He's gonna play him.

1095
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,000
It's going to be like an ironic comedy.

1096
00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:44,331
No,

1097
00:32:44,331 --> 00:32:46,180
you know who they're going to get
what's to do with the cleft palate.

1098
00:32:46,210 --> 00:32:46,360
You,

1099
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:47,270
Joaquin Phoenix.

1100
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,313
He's going to do it.

1101
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:49,950
He's going to play it like that though.

1102
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,260
I'll be bloated,

1103
00:32:51,261 --> 00:32:53,240
cooked dead guide number two for the,

1104
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:54,560
did you see,

1105
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:56,420
did you see his dumb movie,

1106
00:32:56,421 --> 00:32:59,260
that movie that everybody was telling
you that was really good that walking in

1107
00:32:59,261 --> 00:32:59,800
Phoenix moves?

1108
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:00,860
It's very strange.

1109
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:01,730
Some,

1110
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:06,730
some recent movie that he did like Real
absurdist strange movie with Joaquin

1111
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,111
Phoenix with no,

1112
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:08,944
it wasn't her.

1113
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:11,720
Yeah,

1114
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:12,381
it was like a,

1115
00:33:12,381 --> 00:33:12,730
uh,

1116
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:13,491
I watched,

1117
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:14,780
I was like halfway into it and I was like,

1118
00:33:14,781 --> 00:33:15,050
yeah,

1119
00:33:15,050 --> 00:33:16,220
I'll fuck out anything.

1120
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:17,540
The girl get in trouble kind of.

1121
00:33:17,541 --> 00:33:19,040
Cause she was playing an
Asian and she's white.

1122
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:21,320
I don't know what you're talking about.

1123
00:33:21,321 --> 00:33:22,760
Stone Aloha movie.

1124
00:33:23,390 --> 00:33:24,260
I don't think that's it.

1125
00:33:24,290 --> 00:33:24,831
It was a,

1126
00:33:24,831 --> 00:33:26,360
it was a movie about,

1127
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:28,040
I don't even know what it was about.

1128
00:33:28,041 --> 00:33:29,210
It's just a ridiculous movie.

1129
00:33:29,211 --> 00:33:30,920
I think it was a private
investigator or something.

1130
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:31,850
Halfway in the movie.

1131
00:33:31,851 --> 00:33:32,511
I shut it off.

1132
00:33:32,511 --> 00:33:32,751
I'm sorry.

1133
00:33:32,751 --> 00:33:33,650
I can't even do this.

1134
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:34,401
I never do that.

1135
00:33:34,401 --> 00:33:36,320
I almost always watch a
movie all the way to the end.

1136
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:39,590
That's how I had a movie theater.

1137
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:43,130
I get up and fucking
walk that get hard movie.

1138
00:33:43,370 --> 00:33:44,840
I get a harvest bad.

1139
00:33:44,870 --> 00:33:48,200
There's not one will far Ferrell movie
that I have turned off halfway through

1140
00:33:48,201 --> 00:33:48,350
it.

1141
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:49,760
That movie was horrible.

1142
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:50,420
Uh,

1143
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:51,980
Kevin Hart and Will Ferrell,

1144
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:53,053
Kevin Hart,

1145
00:33:53,810 --> 00:33:55,580
Kevin Hart kills it as a comedian.

1146
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,630
Just kills it.

1147
00:33:56,631 --> 00:33:57,830
He's killing it on the road.

1148
00:33:57,831 --> 00:33:59,240
He's on the cover of rolling stone now.

1149
00:33:59,241 --> 00:34:01,790
I think put a lot of people
don't like his movies.

1150
00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:03,290
I don't know what that's about it.

1151
00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:04,640
He's just not good then.

1152
00:34:04,690 --> 00:34:05,590
It's not good as you.

1153
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,280
Do you think he's doing too many movies?

1154
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:09,020
Does he just just jam them in there?

1155
00:34:09,021 --> 00:34:11,510
Like whatever they come with money
that they think is going to sell?

1156
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:12,980
I don't think I've ever
seen a Kevin Hart movie.

1157
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:13,970
Second only have that one.

1158
00:34:13,971 --> 00:34:14,804
The judge,

1159
00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:16,940
he doesn't turn down his volume.

1160
00:34:16,970 --> 00:34:17,450
You know,

1161
00:34:17,450 --> 00:34:19,100
he's always on like level 10.

1162
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,150
That's what it bothers you.

1163
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,313
I don't know.

1164
00:34:21,470 --> 00:34:23,240
I don't know if I've seen
the Kevin Hart movie,

1165
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:27,230
but I'm just assuming
that he's always that way.

1166
00:34:28,370 --> 00:34:30,710
High Energy Inherent Vice.

1167
00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:31,620
That's the name of the willing,

1168
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:33,260
that poster a lot of people told me.

1169
00:34:33,261 --> 00:34:34,070
It was amazing.

1170
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:35,360
Like this is such a cool movie.

1171
00:34:35,361 --> 00:34:37,100
And I was halfway into it.

1172
00:34:37,101 --> 00:34:37,401
I was like,

1173
00:34:37,401 --> 00:34:38,600
you gotta be fucking kidding me.

1174
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,070
What are you doing to me?

1175
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:42,270
You fucks good.

1176
00:34:42,310 --> 00:34:43,143
Pallister though.

1177
00:34:43,210 --> 00:34:43,420
Oh,

1178
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:43,610
it's,

1179
00:34:43,610 --> 00:34:45,830
it's stylistically a very cool movie.

1180
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:47,053
And I loved that

1181
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:49,640
they can do that.

1182
00:34:49,970 --> 00:34:54,170
All the residuals from this movie should
go to the graphic designer for this

1183
00:34:54,171 --> 00:34:54,561
poster.

1184
00:34:54,561 --> 00:34:57,320
And then the people put together
the traders or the producers,

1185
00:34:57,370 --> 00:34:58,203
you know?

1186
00:34:58,610 --> 00:35:00,110
But it never goes that way.

1187
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:00,490
Well,

1188
00:35:00,490 --> 00:35:02,420
it's got this 1960s vibe to it,

1189
00:35:02,421 --> 00:35:03,610
or 1970s vibe too.

1190
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:04,960
It's just a very strange movie.

1191
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:06,793
Just didn't,

1192
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:07,820
didn't get into it.

1193
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:08,961
So,

1194
00:35:08,961 --> 00:35:09,141
uh,

1195
00:35:09,141 --> 00:35:10,040
you're on girl code,

1196
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,470
an girl code.

1197
00:35:12,770 --> 00:35:13,603
What do you do for that?

1198
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:15,140
What does that involve?

1199
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:16,580
Being a talking head.

1200
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:19,820
So it's like one of those things where
things play in the news and you start,

1201
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:20,713
you comment on it.

1202
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:22,611
They don't do the news,

1203
00:35:22,611 --> 00:35:23,810
they just give you topics

1204
00:35:25,450 --> 00:35:25,861
and Hoff.

1205
00:35:25,861 --> 00:35:26,694
Did he do that?

1206
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:30,830
Well I did it like once
a month when I did it.

1207
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:32,133
Yeah.

1208
00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:32,990
But yeah,

1209
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:33,890
I'm not doing anymore.

1210
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:35,533
Stopped

1211
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:38,340
was like I've had enough.

1212
00:35:39,450 --> 00:35:42,990
I've had enough of you guys dressing
me up like I'm a 14 year old girl.

1213
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:43,993
So they did.

1214
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:45,083
Yeah.

1215
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:47,310
Like I would have like bows in my hair.

1216
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:49,513
What is that?

1217
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:50,371
That's racist,

1218
00:35:50,371 --> 00:35:50,910
right?

1219
00:35:50,910 --> 00:35:53,490
Well they would like make
all of us look like that.

1220
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:55,570
All the girls on the scene,

1221
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:57,600
I mean not like all of them,

1222
00:35:57,601 --> 00:35:59,340
but maybe some of them

1223
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:03,420
know how many black girls.

1224
00:36:03,421 --> 00:36:04,830
No diversity on girl code.

1225
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:06,540
Like behind the scenes,

1226
00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:07,640
but talent.

1227
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:08,280
The talent.

1228
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:08,551
Yes.

1229
00:36:08,551 --> 00:36:08,960
Yes.

1230
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:09,960
Did they make the talent?

1231
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:10,823
The black girls?

1232
00:36:11,810 --> 00:36:12,643
They're 12

1233
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:16,053
I don't know.

1234
00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:16,903
You don't know?

1235
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:19,270
You should know.

1236
00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:22,703
You ask him.

1237
00:36:30,970 --> 00:36:31,950
Taught me how to

1238
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:35,930
go off on the spot.

1239
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,433
I don't know.

1240
00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:45,403
Kanye West,

1241
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:05,560
her damps per day.

1242
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:12,660
How many times a day does she get damped?

1243
00:37:12,661 --> 00:37:13,494
If she were to check,

1244
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,520
everybody listening would want to
know what you're talking about,

1245
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:47,860
but it seems like those shows,

1246
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:53,690
that's like pretty much

1247
00:37:58,650 --> 00:37:59,483
credit.

1248
00:38:00,090 --> 00:38:01,080
You don't get a writer's credit,

1249
00:38:01,310 --> 00:38:03,590
don't get paid very much.

1250
00:38:05,370 --> 00:38:06,660
It's a wild life show,

1251
00:38:06,661 --> 00:38:08,240
and occasionally Esther come on

1252
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:12,540
people's opinions on stuff.

1253
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:16,300
They have those VH one shows.

1254
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:25,070
Basically they show clips
splice in between people
talking about like cherry pie

1255
00:38:26,341 --> 00:38:27,240
or something like that,

1256
00:38:27,241 --> 00:38:29,250
and that's really what the whole show is,

1257
00:38:29,690 --> 00:38:30,840
but yet the people that do it,

1258
00:38:30,841 --> 00:38:31,920
they don't get paid that much.

1259
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:33,690
It's one of those little sneaky things.

1260
00:38:33,691 --> 00:38:36,100
They just figure they get you and

1261
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:38,260
then somebody makes a lot of money.

1262
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,220
Like Byron Allen,

1263
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:43,510
Byron Allen Comics
unleashed with Byron Allen.

1264
00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:47,620
The whole show is Byron Allen
talking to Comedians and they,

1265
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:48,730
hey Esther,

1266
00:38:48,730 --> 00:38:51,500
I understand you like zoos and you'll
just start talking about the zoom.

1267
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:51,800
No.

1268
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:54,160
Can you make it sound like
he's not forcing it so much?

1269
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,121
It's all forest.

1270
00:38:55,121 --> 00:38:56,680
It's all forest and no one gives a fuck.

1271
00:38:56,980 --> 00:38:58,450
But that's the whole show.

1272
00:38:58,510 --> 00:38:59,920
And but he sells that show.

1273
00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:03,250
Byron Allen grew up around
show business like what?

1274
00:39:03,251 --> 00:39:06,040
His mom worked for David Letterman or no,

1275
00:39:06,041 --> 00:39:06,580
not David.

1276
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:07,413
Johnny Carson.

1277
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:07,990
Oh Wow.

1278
00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:09,260
So his mom would clean,

1279
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:10,930
would clean her,

1280
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:15,100
his office and he would see the whole
taping and he'd be a little kid standing

1281
00:39:15,101 --> 00:39:17,650
there like six years old
watching Johnny Carson,

1282
00:39:17,651 --> 00:39:20,590
like say how to do it in the parking lot
and then go on stage and make the magic

1283
00:39:20,591 --> 00:39:21,160
happen.

1284
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:22,240
That's probably why he does it.

1285
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,350
Like old school like that.

1286
00:39:23,351 --> 00:39:23,510
Yeah.

1287
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:23,870
Yeah,

1288
00:39:23,870 --> 00:39:24,670
it does it.

1289
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:25,300
That's,

1290
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:27,070
that's who he watched every day.

1291
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:29,290
Don't you think when you
watch a talk show today,

1292
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:30,430
like if you watch like,

1293
00:39:30,431 --> 00:39:31,264
um,

1294
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:31,841
anyone,

1295
00:39:31,841 --> 00:39:32,770
Fallon or any,

1296
00:39:32,771 --> 00:39:34,390
any of these new talk shows?

1297
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:35,680
There is,

1298
00:39:35,681 --> 00:39:39,490
it seems so weird to me that no
one can move away from the desk.

1299
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:40,270
Yeah.

1300
00:39:40,270 --> 00:39:43,810
You have to have a fucking
desk and pretend like you're
working in an office and

1301
00:39:43,811 --> 00:39:47,680
right next to you in most awkward way
possible has to be someone sitting in a

1302
00:39:47,681 --> 00:39:49,050
chair next to the desk.

1303
00:39:49,570 --> 00:39:51,790
Why is it made to look like an office?

1304
00:39:51,850 --> 00:39:53,110
It's so strange.

1305
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:54,010
Wouldn't be couches,

1306
00:39:54,011 --> 00:39:55,230
be better bed.

1307
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:58,540
It's kind of like a doctor's
office or something,

1308
00:39:58,541 --> 00:40:00,250
like you're sitting
next to a receptionist.

1309
00:40:00,251 --> 00:40:01,660
It's like you don't even face them.

1310
00:40:01,870 --> 00:40:03,970
It's the weirdest way
to have a conversation.

1311
00:40:04,270 --> 00:40:04,781
It's like if we,

1312
00:40:04,781 --> 00:40:05,614
we were,

1313
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:09,490
the cameras were here where Jamie is
and you and I will be talking like this.

1314
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:09,850
That's,

1315
00:40:09,850 --> 00:40:11,620
that's literally how it
would be doing the show.

1316
00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:12,730
We'll be right back.

1317
00:40:13,690 --> 00:40:14,170
And you,

1318
00:40:14,170 --> 00:40:16,500
the camera's facing you
and you'd go sideways.

1319
00:40:16,510 --> 00:40:20,320
The first talk show host who
had a desk set up on his stage,

1320
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:23,740
probably par Jack Parr who was before.

1321
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:24,551
Is that who it was?

1322
00:40:24,551 --> 00:40:29,110
That was maybe Jack Harlan didn't like
wearing pants and he just wanted to cover

1323
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:30,580
his lower body.

1324
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:33,430
Who Do you think was the
original talk show host on TV?

1325
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:34,570
What do you want to say?

1326
00:40:36,130 --> 00:40:37,720
What was the original
television talk show?

1327
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,160
I have no idea.

1328
00:40:40,090 --> 00:40:40,960
I'll go with Jack Paar.

1329
00:40:40,961 --> 00:40:41,740
That sounds good.

1330
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:42,041
Yeah.

1331
00:40:42,041 --> 00:40:43,390
I don't even know if that's his real name.

1332
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:44,463
Okay.

1333
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:45,980
Wait,

1334
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:49,090
you talked showing Steve Allen
was a big one for a while.

1335
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:52,300
Late night talk show Wikipedia,

1336
00:40:52,350 --> 00:40:52,660
Dat,

1337
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:53,001
Dat,

1338
00:40:53,001 --> 00:40:53,320
Dat,

1339
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,153
Dat,

1340
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:55,180
dat to that on that.

1341
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:55,780
Um,

1342
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:56,081
all right.

1343
00:40:56,081 --> 00:40:56,920
Let's go with history.

1344
00:40:56,921 --> 00:40:58,810
United States forties and Whoa.

1345
00:40:58,860 --> 00:40:59,860
Forties okay,

1346
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:02,560
so they had radio ones,

1347
00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:05,050
so they had these old time radio shows.

1348
00:41:05,490 --> 00:41:06,323
That's cool.

1349
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:11,300
So they didn't have the two
chairs and since Sullivan show,

1350
00:41:11,810 --> 00:41:13,950
Ed Sullivan might've been
one of the first ones,

1351
00:41:13,951 --> 00:41:14,784
right.

1352
00:41:14,790 --> 00:41:15,623
That aired on,

1353
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:16,320
whoa.

1354
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,153
Jesus Christ.

1355
00:41:17,430 --> 00:41:18,570
Ed Sullivan,

1356
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:20,850
originally known as toast of the town,

1357
00:41:20,851 --> 00:41:25,851
which aired on CBS Sunday nights
from 1948 to 1971 holy shit.

1358
00:41:27,301 --> 00:41:29,640
Did you know I have no idea.

1359
00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:31,170
Jesus Christ,

1360
00:41:32,070 --> 00:41:33,380
23 years.

1361
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:34,400
That's insane.

1362
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:35,460
33 well,

1363
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:36,051
that's insane.

1364
00:41:36,051 --> 00:41:37,040
23 years.

1365
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:38,671
Wait,

1366
00:41:38,671 --> 00:41:41,820
48 to two doing the math

1367
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:45,180
to 70 what?

1368
00:41:45,690 --> 00:41:48,300
(712) 037-0120 three years.

1369
00:41:48,830 --> 00:41:49,280
Melvin barrel.

1370
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:49,590
Also,

1371
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:51,510
I was at a show and 23 Michael Jordan,

1372
00:41:51,930 --> 00:41:54,600
Milton Berle had one in 48 on NBC.

1373
00:41:55,110 --> 00:41:58,890
The shows aired once a week in the evening
time slots that would come to known

1374
00:41:58,891 --> 00:42:00,330
as prime time.

1375
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:05,420
The first show to air on late night was
Broadway Open House and aired on NBC in

1376
00:42:05,581 --> 00:42:07,560
1950 it was canceled a year later.

1377
00:42:07,561 --> 00:42:11,010
Not enough people own television says
to make a late night television series

1378
00:42:11,011 --> 00:42:11,844
worthwhile.

1379
00:42:12,090 --> 00:42:13,080
Whoa.

1380
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:16,080
The first version of the tonight
show starring Steve Allen.

1381
00:42:16,081 --> 00:42:19,800
So he was the first 1954 on NBC.

1382
00:42:19,801 --> 00:42:21,570
I wonder if that was 11
o'clock at night too.

1383
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:23,560
Hmm.

1384
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:26,580
The show created many modern
talk show staples earlier.

1385
00:42:28,610 --> 00:42:28,971
Yeah.

1386
00:42:28,971 --> 00:42:31,160
Maybe I went to bed
earlier back in the day.

1387
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:31,821
Yeah,

1388
00:42:31,821 --> 00:42:32,370
I'm probably,

1389
00:42:32,370 --> 00:42:33,680
did they go to sleep later?

1390
00:42:34,470 --> 00:42:36,530
I thought would think there had
been went to bed earlier earlier.

1391
00:42:37,370 --> 00:42:39,280
They wouldn't have started electricity,

1392
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:45,000
electricity to watching TV on by candle
light farmers and never have to go to

1393
00:42:45,411 --> 00:42:45,711
bed.

1394
00:42:45,711 --> 00:42:46,461
When it got dark.

1395
00:42:46,461 --> 00:42:47,870
They weren't streetlights yet.

1396
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:50,600
So this says that Steve
Allen created at all.

1397
00:42:50,601 --> 00:42:51,021
It says,

1398
00:42:51,021 --> 00:42:53,450
the show created many
monitored talk show staples,

1399
00:42:53,451 --> 00:42:55,130
including the opening monologue,

1400
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:56,540
celebrity interviews,

1401
00:42:56,630 --> 00:42:57,920
audience participation,

1402
00:42:57,921 --> 00:42:59,990
comedy bits and musical performances.

1403
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:00,981
By this point,

1404
00:43:00,981 --> 00:43:05,030
the federal communications commission
had lifted a freeze on new television

1405
00:43:05,031 --> 00:43:05,780
stations,

1406
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:10,040
which allowed new stations to pop up
across the country and television adoption

1407
00:43:10,041 --> 00:43:12,170
soon grew exponentially as a result,

1408
00:43:12,350 --> 00:43:14,120
unlike broadly open house,

1409
00:43:14,330 --> 00:43:16,820
the tonight show proved to
be a resoundingly success,

1410
00:43:16,970 --> 00:43:17,803
Huh?

1411
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:19,700
What the fuck was that like?

1412
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:24,230
Pull up a video on the tonight show with
Steve Allen from like the earliest you

1413
00:43:24,231 --> 00:43:25,064
could find.

1414
00:43:25,110 --> 00:43:27,380
No wonder is Byron and got his job.

1415
00:43:27,470 --> 00:43:29,330
He's like in the family and island.

1416
00:43:29,990 --> 00:43:30,410
Well,

1417
00:43:30,410 --> 00:43:34,580
he also found one of those niches where
you could kind of sell a show like that.

1418
00:43:34,610 --> 00:43:36,650
Like that's what I was kind
of saying is that those shows,

1419
00:43:36,651 --> 00:43:38,390
it doesn't cost much to make them,

1420
00:43:38,470 --> 00:43:40,220
you don't pay the comedians much.

1421
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:42,620
That's all stories
written by other people.

1422
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:43,430
Exactly.

1423
00:43:43,430 --> 00:43:43,970
They're like,

1424
00:43:43,970 --> 00:43:45,200
but I put it together,

1425
00:43:45,410 --> 00:43:50,000
I put it in a book and I'm going to make
all the money and my names like I'm on

1426
00:43:50,001 --> 00:43:50,834
as an author.

1427
00:43:50,870 --> 00:43:52,910
I mean that kind of is the exact show.

1428
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:55,490
The whole show is people doing their acts.

1429
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:56,570
You know what I mean?

1430
00:43:56,570 --> 00:43:57,270
Literally it's,

1431
00:43:57,270 --> 00:43:58,103
you're doing,

1432
00:43:58,770 --> 00:43:59,603
it's total ripoff.

1433
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:00,733
It's like if you were sick,

1434
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:03,950
if you were singing songs that you
wrote and then they sold the cds,

1435
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:04,401
he be like,

1436
00:44:04,401 --> 00:44:05,234
what the fuck?

1437
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:06,590
That's what they're doing.

1438
00:44:06,591 --> 00:44:08,570
I mean these people creating these bits,

1439
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:09,380
they have them,

1440
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:10,011
then they go,

1441
00:44:10,011 --> 00:44:10,340
uh,

1442
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:12,230
so I understand you've
got a two year old kid,

1443
00:44:12,231 --> 00:44:12,501
man.

1444
00:44:12,501 --> 00:44:13,251
Have a two year old.

1445
00:44:13,251 --> 00:44:14,530
It's tough buying them.

1446
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:15,410
It's hey,

1447
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:16,280
hey.

1448
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:18,370
And they do the bit and then I really,

1449
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:19,011
everyone class,

1450
00:44:19,011 --> 00:44:19,641
we'll be right back.

1451
00:44:19,641 --> 00:44:21,920
Here's some commercials we sold
based on this guy's material,

1452
00:44:22,070 --> 00:44:23,390
but they all are,

1453
00:44:23,391 --> 00:44:24,350
they're selling something

1454
00:44:28,610 --> 00:44:31,890
from 1963 of the mall.

1455
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:35,250
He plays the bicycle and
his name is Frank Zappa.

1456
00:44:35,410 --> 00:44:35,620
Look,

1457
00:44:35,620 --> 00:44:37,660
it is Frank Zappa.

1458
00:44:38,510 --> 00:44:39,490
Is that Frank Zappa?

1459
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:40,120
Yeah.

1460
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:40,660
Yeah.

1461
00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:41,540
The guy on the left.

1462
00:44:41,541 --> 00:44:43,270
That is Frank Zappa bicycle.

1463
00:44:43,850 --> 00:44:44,683
Yeah.

1464
00:44:44,930 --> 00:44:45,200
Wow.

1465
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:46,033
Musician's Union.

1466
00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:47,170
Uh,

1467
00:44:47,170 --> 00:44:47,590
no,

1468
00:44:47,590 --> 00:44:49,540
he's so musical instrument.

1469
00:44:49,541 --> 00:44:50,440
Anything more conventional,

1470
00:44:50,441 --> 00:44:52,270
perhaps you're tired of lives.

1471
00:44:52,271 --> 00:44:53,104
Bass and drums.

1472
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:54,153
Guitar,

1473
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:54,401
Bass,

1474
00:44:54,401 --> 00:44:55,300
drums and bicycle.

1475
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:59,350
Bicycle will travel from
his base to is your arms.

1476
00:44:59,380 --> 00:45:00,213
It was a good time.

1477
00:45:00,370 --> 00:45:00,791
Uh,

1478
00:45:00,791 --> 00:45:03,130
how did you happen to pick
up your first bicycle?

1479
00:45:03,940 --> 00:45:07,000
I was discussing this before with
some of the people backstage.

1480
00:45:07,001 --> 00:45:10,600
I believe that a lot of the people have
actually played by cycles from time to

1481
00:45:10,601 --> 00:45:11,530
time by side.

1482
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:12,281
They're young.

1483
00:45:12,281 --> 00:45:16,990
They take a piece of cardboard
and a clothes pin and
attach it to the rear wheel

1484
00:45:16,991 --> 00:45:17,980
and when it goes around,

1485
00:45:17,981 --> 00:45:20,170
it makes that noise and you're
playing a biocycle then.

1486
00:45:20,750 --> 00:45:20,920
Oh,

1487
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:21,241
I see.

1488
00:45:21,241 --> 00:45:23,500
You mean when they pretend they have a
little motor and just make it sound like

1489
00:45:23,501 --> 00:45:24,010
a motorbike?

1490
00:45:24,010 --> 00:45:24,161
Yes,

1491
00:45:24,161 --> 00:45:24,994
we've all done that.

1492
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:25,541
What was that?

1493
00:45:25,541 --> 00:45:25,961
What you'll do?

1494
00:45:25,961 --> 00:45:27,190
You'll make a motorbike noise.

1495
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:28,600
I see a couple of bikes over here.

1496
00:45:28,601 --> 00:45:30,730
Perhaps you'd better go over and
demonstrate and show them what you do.

1497
00:45:30,980 --> 00:45:33,780
What the fuck where people
entertained by back then Pa.

1498
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:36,830
I understand you drove a bicycle wheel.

1499
00:45:36,831 --> 00:45:38,420
Here we are a French stereo bikes.

1500
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:43,520
So Zappa's playing musical
instruments on the bikes,

1501
00:45:43,690 --> 00:45:44,230
please.

1502
00:45:44,230 --> 00:45:44,880
Uh,

1503
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:45,180
yes.

1504
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:47,620
Well Yours is Kim Dawson style in 1916

1505
00:45:48,510 --> 00:45:49,770
there's two clips that
were a little earlier,

1506
00:45:49,771 --> 00:45:50,604
but you couldn't see what we,

1507
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:54,060
this is after Kennedy was killed as
Louis know what you're doing with them.

1508
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:55,950
How crazy is that?

1509
00:45:55,980 --> 00:46:00,980
March 4th how long does it kill them to
make November microphones that clip onto

1510
00:46:01,441 --> 00:46:02,274
your shirt?

1511
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:04,590
He's like holding the
microphone back and forth.

1512
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:07,740
I know and it's a stupid
looking microphone because dumb.

1513
00:46:07,741 --> 00:46:08,610
That microphone looks,

1514
00:46:08,611 --> 00:46:09,570
looks like a corn dog.

1515
00:46:10,470 --> 00:46:13,500
Like how many years did he go
holding the microphone like that?

1516
00:46:13,501 --> 00:46:14,310
It'd be sillier than that.

1517
00:46:14,310 --> 00:46:15,071
That's what they did.

1518
00:46:15,071 --> 00:46:15,190
Yeah.

1519
00:46:15,190 --> 00:46:16,530
They had to do back and forth.

1520
00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:19,900
We had a hand it back and forth until
somebody invented the [inaudible].

1521
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:21,633
Yeah.

1522
00:46:21,750 --> 00:46:23,490
They couldn't run to my
Crohn's at the same time.

1523
00:46:23,491 --> 00:46:24,460
They were low fuses.

1524
00:46:24,470 --> 00:46:25,320
Start fires.

1525
00:46:25,321 --> 00:46:25,890
Right.

1526
00:46:25,890 --> 00:46:29,310
You will be familiar with you going to
play violin and ride a bike at the same

1527
00:46:29,311 --> 00:46:29,551
time.

1528
00:46:29,551 --> 00:46:31,110
The score for the world's greatest center,

1529
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:32,913
the,

1530
00:46:34,730 --> 00:46:36,680
he's laughing and who might that be?

1531
00:46:37,910 --> 00:46:38,800
Tommy Manville.

1532
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:40,553
Tell us about that.

1533
00:46:40,690 --> 00:46:41,390
Are you talking to me?

1534
00:46:41,390 --> 00:46:41,570
Okay,

1535
00:46:41,570 --> 00:46:42,610
let's skip ahead to the music.

1536
00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:43,160
Yeah,

1537
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:43,550
sure.

1538
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:45,980
Did the music for the world's greatest.

1539
00:46:46,580 --> 00:46:47,413
Okay,

1540
00:46:48,220 --> 00:46:49,510
but that's one of the sounds.

1541
00:46:51,150 --> 00:46:52,410
What is this?

1542
00:46:58,260 --> 00:46:58,531
Oh,

1543
00:46:58,531 --> 00:47:00,420
he's playing the bicycle wires.

1544
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:01,920
Who has like a violin?

1545
00:47:02,180 --> 00:47:02,640
Yeah,

1546
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:03,980
sounds fine.

1547
00:47:04,770 --> 00:47:07,020
Zappo was weird as fuck.

1548
00:47:07,470 --> 00:47:07,620
No,

1549
00:47:07,620 --> 00:47:07,820
no.

1550
00:47:07,820 --> 00:47:11,820
1963 when he was a buttoned
up with a tie and a suit.

1551
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:15,330
He was weird as fuck I got when
I first started smoking weed,

1552
00:47:15,331 --> 00:47:16,860
that was the first
music I would listen to.

1553
00:47:16,861 --> 00:47:20,220
Me and my friends would just sit in our
car and smoke and listened to Zachary.

1554
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:22,470
I listened to Zappa way before that.

1555
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:23,790
Before I was smoking weed.

1556
00:47:23,791 --> 00:47:25,650
I listened to Zappa
because I had a friend,

1557
00:47:25,651 --> 00:47:27,780
my friend Tommy when I lived,

1558
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:29,080
Shit,

1559
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:30,820
I think I lived in Florida.

1560
00:47:31,660 --> 00:47:32,360
My friend.

1561
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:32,561
Yeah,

1562
00:47:32,561 --> 00:47:33,230
it was Florida.

1563
00:47:33,230 --> 00:47:33,671
My friend,

1564
00:47:33,671 --> 00:47:37,570
Tommy's dad was a a real freak.

1565
00:47:37,571 --> 00:47:40,390
He was a weird dude and he had a sob.

1566
00:47:40,410 --> 00:47:43,210
I remember it was the first guy
that I've ever met that had a Saab.

1567
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:46,090
The Saa be one of those cars.

1568
00:47:46,180 --> 00:47:47,380
Those guys are freaks.

1569
00:47:47,410 --> 00:47:47,591
Well,

1570
00:47:47,591 --> 00:47:50,170
back then it was weird like he
had the key was on the ground,

1571
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:50,961
like on the floor.

1572
00:47:50,961 --> 00:47:51,161
I'm like,

1573
00:47:51,161 --> 00:47:52,260
what is this,

1574
00:47:52,261 --> 00:47:52,700
this car?

1575
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:54,890
So it was a really old site

1576
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:58,720
because it was the 1970s but a,

1577
00:47:58,721 --> 00:48:01,750
he was a fucking gigantic Zappa head.

1578
00:48:01,751 --> 00:48:02,141
This guy,

1579
00:48:02,141 --> 00:48:04,510
and he would play Zappa
for me and for his son.

1580
00:48:05,350 --> 00:48:07,060
Interesting music because it's a,

1581
00:48:07,061 --> 00:48:10,240
it was really great to listen to with
like headphones on because there were so

1582
00:48:10,241 --> 00:48:12,430
much noises and sounds going on.

1583
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:13,390
So when,

1584
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:14,550
when I was a young pothead,

1585
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:15,760
that's all I would do is like,

1586
00:48:15,850 --> 00:48:18,060
it felt like trimming pot head,

1587
00:48:18,380 --> 00:48:19,213
right?

1588
00:48:19,310 --> 00:48:19,570
No,

1589
00:48:19,570 --> 00:48:20,410
he's not young anymore,

1590
00:48:20,411 --> 00:48:21,440
but he's definitely still a potter.

1591
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:22,211
But you know,

1592
00:48:22,211 --> 00:48:22,691
like those,

1593
00:48:22,691 --> 00:48:23,230
um,

1594
00:48:23,230 --> 00:48:23,471
like,

1595
00:48:23,471 --> 00:48:23,680
uh,

1596
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:28,150
if you listen to like a old Hendricks
and you hear like different sounds going

1597
00:48:28,151 --> 00:48:29,800
back and forth across the,

1598
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:31,630
like the field of sound,

1599
00:48:31,631 --> 00:48:34,980
like when you have the headphones on and
go left and right and right and left as

1600
00:48:34,981 --> 00:48:35,830
the coolest shit.

1601
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:38,320
That's what I graduated too after.

1602
00:48:38,321 --> 00:48:38,800
Exactly.

1603
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:39,290
Yeah.

1604
00:48:39,290 --> 00:48:42,010
That was like what they
figured out how to do.

1605
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:44,050
They didn't figure it out how to
do that until like the sixties.

1606
00:48:44,051 --> 00:48:44,884
Right.

1607
00:48:45,010 --> 00:48:45,461
Jamie,

1608
00:48:45,461 --> 00:48:45,851
you know,

1609
00:48:45,851 --> 00:48:49,390
you're a sound engineer and stuff going
back and forth and back and forth,

1610
00:48:49,391 --> 00:48:50,290
like the shit like,

1611
00:48:50,291 --> 00:48:50,800
uh,

1612
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:51,970
like the like,

1613
00:48:51,971 --> 00:48:52,181
you know,

1614
00:48:52,181 --> 00:48:56,890
that long pause in whole lot of love
where everything gets really weird.

1615
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:57,700
Like they,

1616
00:48:57,700 --> 00:49:01,420
it sounds like a normal song and then
it's just weird moaning and fuck noises

1617
00:49:01,421 --> 00:49:04,210
and strange symbols and stuff
for like a minute and a half.

1618
00:49:04,540 --> 00:49:05,190
You know that.

1619
00:49:05,190 --> 00:49:05,341
Yeah.

1620
00:49:05,341 --> 00:49:08,270
There's a lot of stuff that was happening
with Zeppelin because of they were

1621
00:49:08,271 --> 00:49:10,770
using magnetic tape
and storage cause like,

1622
00:49:10,830 --> 00:49:14,940
oh get the wet that if the tape was wound
too tightly it would get taped bleed

1623
00:49:15,450 --> 00:49:16,740
and uh,

1624
00:49:16,860 --> 00:49:17,880
five seconds before.

1625
00:49:17,881 --> 00:49:20,480
That's kind of how these weird reverb
things and weird delays what happens.

1626
00:49:20,481 --> 00:49:21,780
So we're like sort of like that.

1627
00:49:22,050 --> 00:49:22,980
There'd be a weird screaming,

1628
00:49:22,981 --> 00:49:26,640
would it be a previous take on a vocal
track because of the way it was stored?

1629
00:49:26,940 --> 00:49:28,590
It would end up 30 seconds later,

1630
00:49:28,591 --> 00:49:31,770
a minute later on another part of
the song and it just sounded so cool.

1631
00:49:31,771 --> 00:49:33,060
They just kind of left that kind of stuff.

1632
00:49:33,061 --> 00:49:33,894
Then it's really,

1633
00:49:33,930 --> 00:49:35,040
instead of recording it over,

1634
00:49:35,041 --> 00:49:36,000
doing it all over again,

1635
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:38,160
really accidents would just happen.

1636
00:49:38,161 --> 00:49:38,560
They'd leave it.

1637
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:39,393
Man.

1638
00:49:39,450 --> 00:49:40,650
Dad's amazing.

1639
00:49:40,651 --> 00:49:41,700
I never heard that before.

1640
00:49:41,701 --> 00:49:43,290
So it's magnetic bleed,

1641
00:49:43,650 --> 00:49:44,483
tape bleed.

1642
00:49:45,110 --> 00:49:45,943
Wow.

1643
00:49:46,130 --> 00:49:49,200
As to learn some new shit every day.

1644
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:50,760
Kind of like when a movie,

1645
00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:53,790
an old movie has all the fucked up films,

1646
00:49:53,791 --> 00:49:57,210
you know from Mike seriation and
water damage and stuff like that.

1647
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:57,631
Well when they,

1648
00:49:57,631 --> 00:49:59,640
whenever they want to show
you like an educational film,

1649
00:49:59,670 --> 00:50:00,780
a pretend education,

1650
00:50:00,810 --> 00:50:01,591
like if it's a movie,

1651
00:50:01,591 --> 00:50:05,160
like a horror movie and they show like
an educational film for the 1950s it

1652
00:50:05,161 --> 00:50:09,600
always has this like crackles and pops
and this weird little artifacts and stuff

1653
00:50:09,601 --> 00:50:10,530
across the screen.

1654
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:12,290
Not Anymore kids.

1655
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:13,410
Yeah.

1656
00:50:13,410 --> 00:50:14,243
Not Anymore though.

1657
00:50:14,730 --> 00:50:18,600
Magazine ads from the 50s or so like cute,

1658
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:20,153
aren't they?

1659
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:21,353
They're kind of cute.

1660
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:23,720
Then the fact that people
will like dumb kids back then.

1661
00:50:24,090 --> 00:50:25,880
It's weird that your
parents are like dumb kids.

1662
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:27,560
So simple that a or just like,

1663
00:50:27,561 --> 00:50:27,741
wow,

1664
00:50:27,741 --> 00:50:28,070
that's so

1665
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:28,880
cute.

1666
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:33,880
You know like vintage advertisements
for like Sears or Woolworths or an iron,

1667
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:35,713
you know,

1668
00:50:35,870 --> 00:50:40,870
selling to the housewives in
the 50s basic basic bitches.

1669
00:50:41,090 --> 00:50:42,660
People were just dumb or back then,

1670
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:43,461
yeah,

1671
00:50:43,461 --> 00:50:45,020
women were just uneducated.

1672
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:47,360
One was not an educated,

1673
00:50:48,230 --> 00:50:52,610
they knew how to do laundry and
get grease out of aprons and shit.

1674
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:53,733
Barely knew.

1675
00:50:54,140 --> 00:50:54,510
They don't know.

1676
00:50:54,510 --> 00:50:57,020
That had a vague apple pie.

1677
00:50:58,290 --> 00:50:59,000
Apple pies.

1678
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,050
Jesus Christ asked her,

1679
00:51:00,051 --> 00:51:01,310
what the fuck are you talking about?

1680
00:51:03,020 --> 00:51:04,880
Fake Lemon Meringue Pie.

1681
00:51:05,330 --> 00:51:07,790
I think they'd still
big paws last I checked.

1682
00:51:08,150 --> 00:51:09,200
That's still common to cook.

1683
00:51:10,190 --> 00:51:11,020
I do cook.

1684
00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:11,840
What do you cook?

1685
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:12,673
Um,

1686
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:16,580
I make a curry carrot soup.

1687
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:17,361
Curry.

1688
00:51:17,361 --> 00:51:18,080
Carrot soup.

1689
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:18,350
Yeah.

1690
00:51:18,350 --> 00:51:20,450
Have you ever made that super easy to do?

1691
00:51:21,770 --> 00:51:22,281
It is,

1692
00:51:22,281 --> 00:51:22,730
yeah.

1693
00:51:22,730 --> 00:51:23,301
You just,

1694
00:51:23,301 --> 00:51:24,134
um,

1695
00:51:24,620 --> 00:51:29,620
you just boil some carrots and some
onions and garlic and then put it in the

1696
00:51:29,781 --> 00:51:32,300
food processor and you got soup.

1697
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:33,793
That seems really,

1698
00:51:34,150 --> 00:51:35,270
that doesn't seem like cooking.

1699
00:51:35,530 --> 00:51:37,580
It's like you just smash
them food together.

1700
00:51:37,610 --> 00:51:38,270
You're juicing,

1701
00:51:38,270 --> 00:51:39,080
you're juicing.

1702
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:39,650
No,

1703
00:51:39,650 --> 00:51:40,520
that's cooking.

1704
00:51:40,521 --> 00:51:41,354
Cook.

1705
00:51:42,050 --> 00:51:42,920
I also cook.

1706
00:51:43,250 --> 00:51:45,800
I also cook lamb cook lamb,

1707
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:46,760
lamb.

1708
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:48,100
I like making um,

1709
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:49,850
orange marmalade.

1710
00:51:50,300 --> 00:51:51,230
Glazed lamb.

1711
00:51:51,460 --> 00:51:52,490
Lamb is a weird one.

1712
00:51:53,230 --> 00:51:53,540
Lambs.

1713
00:51:53,540 --> 00:51:53,991
Weird one.

1714
00:51:53,991 --> 00:51:55,190
Because it's a baby.

1715
00:51:56,450 --> 00:51:57,350
Nobody thinks about that.

1716
00:51:58,950 --> 00:52:01,280
I'm going to stop making lamb baby.

1717
00:52:03,110 --> 00:52:04,520
You forget that it's a baby.

1718
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:06,080
Nobody ever talks about it like that.

1719
00:52:06,081 --> 00:52:07,190
That's why we have a name for it,

1720
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:08,030
you know?

1721
00:52:08,030 --> 00:52:08,151
Well,

1722
00:52:08,151 --> 00:52:10,430
you don't call a a cow cow.

1723
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:11,480
They call it beef,

1724
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:12,320
you know,

1725
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:12,920
chicken.

1726
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:14,250
Nobody gives a fuck about chickens.

1727
00:52:14,420 --> 00:52:15,380
You can call it chicken.

1728
00:52:15,690 --> 00:52:16,220
You know,

1729
00:52:16,220 --> 00:52:16,731
nobody has it.

1730
00:52:16,731 --> 00:52:17,850
Nobody feels bad for chicken.

1731
00:52:17,851 --> 00:52:18,890
So you can just call it a chicken.

1732
00:52:19,250 --> 00:52:22,400
You don't have to call it
some exotic poultry name,

1733
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:23,330
you know,

1734
00:52:23,330 --> 00:52:26,990
but like lamb is the name that
you have the tiny head chickens.

1735
00:52:27,890 --> 00:52:28,191
Right.

1736
00:52:28,191 --> 00:52:29,210
The smaller the brain,

1737
00:52:29,211 --> 00:52:30,170
the smaller the brain,

1738
00:52:30,171 --> 00:52:31,640
the less we care about them I think.

1739
00:52:32,060 --> 00:52:32,893
Hmm.

1740
00:52:32,980 --> 00:52:33,813
That's interesting.

1741
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:34,370
We didn't,

1742
00:52:34,370 --> 00:52:37,700
maybe we didn't have lamb growing
up because it was a religious thing.

1743
00:52:37,701 --> 00:52:40,880
My mom was against it because
it'll land was very biblical.

1744
00:52:40,940 --> 00:52:41,773
She would always say,

1745
00:52:41,780 --> 00:52:43,700
so I never ate lamb growing up.

1746
00:52:43,970 --> 00:52:44,361
Really?

1747
00:52:44,361 --> 00:52:45,194
Do you need it now?

1748
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:46,011
I don't like it.

1749
00:52:46,011 --> 00:52:46,581
I tasted it.

1750
00:52:46,581 --> 00:52:47,660
I don't know if it's just me going,

1751
00:52:47,780 --> 00:52:48,440
yeah man,

1752
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:49,460
you just never had it.

1753
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:50,960
No limbs delicious.

1754
00:52:50,961 --> 00:52:51,681
If it's prepared.

1755
00:52:51,681 --> 00:52:52,190
Right.

1756
00:52:52,190 --> 00:52:52,431
I mean,

1757
00:52:52,431 --> 00:52:54,180
the idea behind it as that it's just not,

1758
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:54,780
it's not,

1759
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:55,880
doesn't have tough muscle.

1760
00:52:55,910 --> 00:52:56,460
Like,

1761
00:52:56,460 --> 00:52:56,631
you know,

1762
00:52:56,631 --> 00:52:58,370
that moves that I cooked the
other day that I had in my,

1763
00:52:58,371 --> 00:52:59,204
uh,

1764
00:52:59,270 --> 00:53:00,103
my Instagram.

1765
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:02,660
That's not the most tender meat.

1766
00:53:02,930 --> 00:53:04,850
Like you have to cook it right.

1767
00:53:05,150 --> 00:53:06,920
Otherwise it can be
kind of tough and chewy.

1768
00:53:06,921 --> 00:53:08,660
It's cause he got to Broil it.

1769
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:09,951
No,

1770
00:53:09,951 --> 00:53:12,590
honestly the best way to
do it really is doing it.

1771
00:53:12,620 --> 00:53:14,620
It's doing is probably the best
way to deal with like the co,

1772
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:15,950
the tougher cuts of meat,

1773
00:53:15,980 --> 00:53:18,830
like a slow it down
for an hour and a half.

1774
00:53:18,890 --> 00:53:19,090
No,

1775
00:53:19,090 --> 00:53:19,940
no many hours.

1776
00:53:19,950 --> 00:53:22,550
You leave it off with five or six hours
I'm doing and one like one of those

1777
00:53:22,630 --> 00:53:25,830
crockpots you know and all
those pressure cookers.

1778
00:53:25,831 --> 00:53:26,010
Leave

1779
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:26,790
it on.

1780
00:53:26,790 --> 00:53:30,450
It's not that hot and it just stays
going all day and it breaks down all the

1781
00:53:30,451 --> 00:53:32,070
tissue and anything that's tough.

1782
00:53:32,490 --> 00:53:34,200
It makes it so that you
could chew through it easy.

1783
00:53:34,350 --> 00:53:35,161
It says becomes real,

1784
00:53:35,161 --> 00:53:35,431
really,

1785
00:53:35,431 --> 00:53:36,264
really tender.

1786
00:53:36,390 --> 00:53:37,350
But if you broil it,

1787
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:38,220
I've never had moves.

1788
00:53:38,221 --> 00:53:39,120
What does it taste like?

1789
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:42,570
Tastes like a cow.

1790
00:53:42,571 --> 00:53:45,670
Fuck the deer a little game.

1791
00:53:46,270 --> 00:53:46,950
No.

1792
00:53:46,950 --> 00:53:47,370
Yeah,

1793
00:53:47,370 --> 00:53:47,551
no,

1794
00:53:47,551 --> 00:53:49,620
it's not gave me the board game.

1795
00:53:49,621 --> 00:53:50,454
He's a weird word.

1796
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:51,530
What does that not mean?

1797
00:53:52,170 --> 00:53:54,990
Usually it means it's
just been poorly prepared.

1798
00:53:55,250 --> 00:53:55,651
Does it?

1799
00:53:55,651 --> 00:53:59,850
Someone either didn't take care of the
meat correctly or they let the tarsal

1800
00:53:59,851 --> 00:54:02,130
glands leak onto the flesh.

1801
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:03,181
Like when,

1802
00:54:03,181 --> 00:54:03,391
uh,

1803
00:54:03,391 --> 00:54:03,930
when you,

1804
00:54:03,930 --> 00:54:06,390
especially when you get
game animals like a deer,

1805
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:07,553
when they're,

1806
00:54:07,620 --> 00:54:08,730
when they're being hunted,

1807
00:54:08,731 --> 00:54:10,680
a lot of times they're being
hunted while they're breeding.

1808
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:12,030
That's when what's called the Rut.

1809
00:54:12,060 --> 00:54:13,110
That's when people hunt them,

1810
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:14,220
which is in November,

1811
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:14,600
you know,

1812
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:15,540
in the fall rather.

1813
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:19,080
And they have a gland on their
legs called the tarsal glance.

1814
00:54:19,081 --> 00:54:19,914
Especially dear.

1815
00:54:20,130 --> 00:54:21,720
If you'd get that stuff on the meat,

1816
00:54:21,750 --> 00:54:23,190
it'll be funky as fuck.

1817
00:54:23,191 --> 00:54:23,940
It stinks.

1818
00:54:23,940 --> 00:54:26,310
It smells weird and we'll
make the food taste weird.

1819
00:54:26,311 --> 00:54:26,521
It'll,

1820
00:54:26,521 --> 00:54:27,360
it'll ruin the meat.

1821
00:54:28,690 --> 00:54:29,230
Yeah.

1822
00:54:29,230 --> 00:54:30,000
The Ken,

1823
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:30,930
another thing can ruin the meat.

1824
00:54:30,931 --> 00:54:33,090
It's just letting it sit out too long,

1825
00:54:33,091 --> 00:54:34,560
letting it go bad.

1826
00:54:34,561 --> 00:54:38,900
That can the or bugs or it get x.

1827
00:54:38,930 --> 00:54:43,930
It could get exposed to the Oregon meet
the rotting Oregon meet before a while,

1828
00:54:44,161 --> 00:54:44,361
while,

1829
00:54:44,361 --> 00:54:45,780
while it's too warm,

1830
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:47,190
like that can happen.

1831
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:48,030
You know,

1832
00:54:48,030 --> 00:54:49,260
there's a lot of things that can go wrong,

1833
00:54:49,261 --> 00:54:50,790
but most of it is preparation.

1834
00:54:50,970 --> 00:54:52,620
If you have deer that's prepared,

1835
00:54:52,621 --> 00:54:53,160
right?

1836
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:54,540
If you get an animal,

1837
00:54:54,541 --> 00:54:55,740
it's taken care of correctly,

1838
00:54:55,741 --> 00:54:56,574
butchered correctly.

1839
00:54:56,790 --> 00:54:57,630
It doesn't taste game.

1840
00:54:57,631 --> 00:54:58,830
It all tastes delicious.

1841
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:00,090
Definitely tastes different.

1842
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:00,900
But they,

1843
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:01,531
as they get older,

1844
00:55:01,531 --> 00:55:02,364
they get funk here.

1845
00:55:02,490 --> 00:55:04,140
Like you get like a real old buck,

1846
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:05,010
you know?

1847
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:08,160
That's why it's kind of weird that
everybody wants to shoot the big old ones

1848
00:55:08,161 --> 00:55:11,400
with the giant antlers because those are
the ones that kind of tastes like shit.

1849
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:15,000
But you want a young deer for food.

1850
00:55:15,060 --> 00:55:15,630
Yeah,

1851
00:55:15,630 --> 00:55:16,590
you want a young deer.

1852
00:55:16,620 --> 00:55:21,620
But for conservation you kind of want an
old deer because the old deer runs off

1853
00:55:22,231 --> 00:55:24,270
the young deer and keeps
them from breeding.

1854
00:55:24,271 --> 00:55:25,650
And maybe the young deer,

1855
00:55:25,830 --> 00:55:30,510
maybe it'd be better if we got more
than me young genetics into the,

1856
00:55:30,511 --> 00:55:31,200
uh,

1857
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:33,580
into the food system there and to the uh,

1858
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:34,953
lifecycle there,

1859
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:35,873
you know?

1860
00:55:36,620 --> 00:55:37,151
So,

1861
00:55:37,151 --> 00:55:37,650
um,

1862
00:55:37,650 --> 00:55:38,281
these deer,

1863
00:55:38,281 --> 00:55:39,180
how long do they,

1864
00:55:39,690 --> 00:55:40,290
how long,

1865
00:55:40,290 --> 00:55:41,123
like how old,

1866
00:55:41,490 --> 00:55:42,121
how old is it?

1867
00:55:42,121 --> 00:55:43,890
Old Dear old,

1868
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:45,750
old dearly eight years old.

1869
00:55:46,470 --> 00:55:48,990
Eight years old is really
what his short life,

1870
00:55:48,991 --> 00:55:49,920
they have both,

1871
00:55:49,921 --> 00:55:53,250
their life is just jumping over
barbwire and dodge and coyote.

1872
00:55:54,740 --> 00:55:55,340
Unless you,

1873
00:55:55,340 --> 00:56:00,340
you leaving one of those areas where
now has like a deer sign where you might

1874
00:56:00,721 --> 00:56:01,710
get hit by a car.

1875
00:56:01,860 --> 00:56:05,100
A good majority of them either
freeze to death or starve to death.

1876
00:56:05,190 --> 00:56:06,060
That happens a lot.

1877
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:08,010
I wouldn't say majority,

1878
00:56:08,011 --> 00:56:09,000
but a good percentage.

1879
00:56:09,390 --> 00:56:11,700
The most of them get
taken out by predators.

1880
00:56:11,820 --> 00:56:13,410
Most of them or cars,

1881
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:14,700
they get hit by cars a lot.

1882
00:56:14,970 --> 00:56:17,340
Like the end of the numbers
that get killed by hunters.

1883
00:56:17,820 --> 00:56:18,960
I wonder what the number is.

1884
00:56:19,770 --> 00:56:20,430
Uh,

1885
00:56:20,430 --> 00:56:21,720
in some places for sure.

1886
00:56:21,790 --> 00:56:22,980
Some places there's hundreds of,

1887
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:24,333
of deaths,

1888
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:24,710
uh,

1889
00:56:24,710 --> 00:56:26,470
of deer killed by cars every year,

1890
00:56:26,471 --> 00:56:31,180
I think in like Michigan to find out
how many deer killed by car accidents in

1891
00:56:31,181 --> 00:56:31,570
Michigan.

1892
00:56:31,570 --> 00:56:33,550
There's places in this country
that are overrun with deer,

1893
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:37,030
like people that live in like Manhattan
and go leave those deer alone.

1894
00:56:37,031 --> 00:56:37,890
They're beautiful.

1895
00:56:38,410 --> 00:56:41,980
A deer crashed through the
dorm window in my dorm.

1896
00:56:42,260 --> 00:56:43,093
Whoa.

1897
00:56:44,010 --> 00:56:44,920
Doing something in there.

1898
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:45,311
No,

1899
00:56:45,311 --> 00:56:48,010
it was Easter weekend and this,

1900
00:56:48,250 --> 00:56:50,770
we woke up and on a
Sunday and there was only,

1901
00:56:50,771 --> 00:56:55,330
it was so creepy because everybody went
home for Easter weekend except for a few

1902
00:56:55,390 --> 00:56:56,223
kids.

1903
00:56:56,230 --> 00:56:57,550
So I was one of them.

1904
00:56:57,580 --> 00:56:58,413
And we're,

1905
00:56:58,780 --> 00:57:03,780
we wake up and go downstairs and there's
blood all over the lobby of our dorm.

1906
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:05,830
Whoa.

1907
00:57:05,830 --> 00:57:06,663
Yeah.

1908
00:57:06,820 --> 00:57:07,653
Whoa.

1909
00:57:07,950 --> 00:57:08,711
I like this dear.

1910
00:57:08,711 --> 00:57:09,820
Just jumped in.

1911
00:57:11,020 --> 00:57:11,291
Yeah,

1912
00:57:11,291 --> 00:57:11,931
that should happen.

1913
00:57:11,931 --> 00:57:12,820
So my friend Cam,

1914
00:57:12,890 --> 00:57:13,360
uh,

1915
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:17,260
some guy died in his neighborhood because
he was driving home and the car in

1916
00:57:17,261 --> 00:57:19,780
front of him hit a deer
current front of him,

1917
00:57:19,781 --> 00:57:20,560
hit a deer.

1918
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:25,560
The deer went over the roof of that guy's
car and crash through his windshield

1919
00:57:25,661 --> 00:57:27,050
and killed him hollering,

1920
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:28,000
shit,

1921
00:57:29,950 --> 00:57:30,783
what the fuck?

1922
00:57:31,090 --> 00:57:32,740
We need deer proof windows.

1923
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:33,400
You're dealing,

1924
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:34,840
if you're dealing with a big deer,

1925
00:57:34,841 --> 00:57:39,000
you're dealing with at
least 150 pounds of,

1926
00:57:39,001 --> 00:57:39,421
uh,

1927
00:57:39,421 --> 00:57:40,990
of bones and meat.

1928
00:57:41,010 --> 00:57:41,843
Oh God.

1929
00:57:42,210 --> 00:57:43,420
13 look at this.

1930
00:57:43,421 --> 00:57:44,890
This number is going to blow you away.

1931
00:57:45,190 --> 00:57:50,190
2013 there were 49,205 reported car
deer crashes in the state of Michigan.

1932
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:58,810
What the fuck that
translates into one car,

1933
00:57:58,811 --> 00:57:59,860
dear crash,

1934
00:57:59,890 --> 00:58:01,330
every nine minutes.

1935
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:02,080
Wow.

1936
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:06,790
These crashes are at
least $130 million a year.

1937
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:08,620
Oh my God.

1938
00:58:10,030 --> 00:58:10,661
In Ohio,

1939
00:58:10,661 --> 00:58:12,450
I had does whistles on my car.

1940
00:58:12,460 --> 00:58:14,760
I'd always make sure that was
the first thing I put on my car.

1941
00:58:14,761 --> 00:58:15,041
He says,

1942
00:58:15,041 --> 00:58:15,281
dear,

1943
00:58:15,281 --> 00:58:16,420
whistles on my kids are good,

1944
00:58:16,421 --> 00:58:17,350
but they don't always work.

1945
00:58:17,860 --> 00:58:20,230
You need one of those
goddamn battering ram bumper.

1946
00:58:20,231 --> 00:58:23,560
So you ever see those bumpers that
they make just for deer in places where

1947
00:58:23,561 --> 00:58:27,850
people live when they run into deer so
often they actually have bumpers that are

1948
00:58:27,851 --> 00:58:29,110
designed to,

1949
00:58:29,111 --> 00:58:31,960
they like the front of
them has like an angle.

1950
00:58:31,990 --> 00:58:32,950
So if they hit the deer,

1951
00:58:32,951 --> 00:58:34,660
the deer goes flying off the sides.

1952
00:58:34,661 --> 00:58:35,494
Yeah.

1953
00:58:35,590 --> 00:58:36,423
Yeah.

1954
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:37,091
Those are,

1955
00:58:37,091 --> 00:58:37,601
those are,

1956
00:58:37,601 --> 00:58:38,800
those are pretty good ones.

1957
00:58:38,801 --> 00:58:39,850
The one the far right.

1958
00:58:39,940 --> 00:58:40,511
Not that one,

1959
00:58:40,511 --> 00:58:40,900
Jamie.

1960
00:58:40,900 --> 00:58:41,620
Not that one.

1961
00:58:41,620 --> 00:58:42,453
The one.

1962
00:58:42,580 --> 00:58:42,790
Yeah,

1963
00:58:42,790 --> 00:58:43,623
look at that one.

1964
00:58:43,630 --> 00:58:44,650
Look at that one ahead of the deer.

1965
00:58:44,651 --> 00:58:45,484
Stuck in it.

1966
00:58:46,090 --> 00:58:46,923
Boom.

1967
00:58:47,110 --> 00:58:48,190
That's crazy.

1968
00:58:48,910 --> 00:58:49,743
That's fucked up.

1969
00:58:50,050 --> 00:58:51,310
But the first semi trucks,

1970
00:58:51,311 --> 00:58:54,700
it's a huge problem because obviously
they drive the one down there.

1971
00:58:54,701 --> 00:58:55,870
Keep going right there.

1972
00:58:55,930 --> 00:58:56,351
Right there.

1973
00:58:56,351 --> 00:58:57,130
That's it.

1974
00:58:57,130 --> 00:58:58,360
See how it's all over the uh,

1975
00:58:58,361 --> 00:58:59,194
the top.

1976
00:58:59,620 --> 00:59:02,140
It's over the top of the
hood and everything as well.

1977
00:59:02,260 --> 00:59:03,490
That's just in case.

1978
00:59:03,580 --> 00:59:03,760
Uh,

1979
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:07,450
the thing comes up and over the top of
the hood that it doesn't crush the hood

1980
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:09,790
and disable the engine.

1981
00:59:10,030 --> 00:59:13,060
But most of them are designed
so that when it hits the thing,

1982
00:59:13,061 --> 00:59:15,580
it bounces them off the left or the right.

1983
00:59:16,300 --> 00:59:17,920
It says she was problem in a lot of areas.

1984
00:59:17,921 --> 00:59:18,580
Car,

1985
00:59:18,580 --> 00:59:20,260
exactly to protect.

1986
00:59:20,261 --> 00:59:21,120
The car doesn't,

1987
00:59:21,370 --> 00:59:22,800
but the deer gets mangled in there.

1988
00:59:22,801 --> 00:59:25,100
At least you still have to stop.

1989
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:25,761
You stopped,

1990
00:59:25,761 --> 00:59:26,331
you pull it out.

1991
00:59:26,331 --> 00:59:27,380
What do you buy your business?

1992
00:59:27,410 --> 00:59:27,561
Yeah.

1993
00:59:27,561 --> 00:59:28,730
Do you have to do that or is there,

1994
00:59:28,731 --> 00:59:30,020
somebody could call it a day that,

1995
00:59:30,021 --> 00:59:32,270
cause I'm not going to want
to call a tow truck company.

1996
00:59:32,570 --> 00:59:34,190
I'm sure he could call someone to do it.

1997
00:59:34,191 --> 00:59:35,000
If you paid them,

1998
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:35,930
I'm sure someone would do it,

1999
00:59:35,931 --> 00:59:36,830
but it's not that hard.

2000
00:59:37,250 --> 00:59:38,240
You just drive off.

2001
00:59:38,290 --> 00:59:40,850
But if you're trying to get
Wifi and get on craigslist,

2002
00:59:40,851 --> 00:59:44,090
looking for somebody to remove
deer from Lane Dashboard,

2003
00:59:44,450 --> 00:59:46,310
I'm on 95 exit 18.

2004
00:59:47,150 --> 00:59:50,030
I think the people that don't live
anywhere around those animals would never

2005
00:59:50,031 --> 00:59:54,890
imagine that there's 49,000 car accidents
a year in a fucking state where cars

2006
00:59:54,891 --> 00:59:55,520
had deer.

2007
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:56,750
But if you're ever around Michigan,

2008
00:59:56,751 --> 00:59:59,600
you would know this should
be Trump's new platform.

2009
01:00:00,250 --> 01:00:03,130
Let's lower the amount of
crashes caused by deer.

2010
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:04,200
You know,

2011
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:05,033
he needs,

2012
01:00:05,390 --> 01:00:07,430
he needs to focus on
something else right now.

2013
01:00:07,780 --> 01:00:08,421
Number one,

2014
01:00:08,421 --> 01:00:09,800
why does he need to focus on anything?

2015
01:00:09,830 --> 01:00:10,790
You know what it seems to me,

2016
01:00:10,820 --> 01:00:12,080
I don't know anything about politics,

2017
01:00:12,081 --> 01:00:15,140
but what it seems to me on the
outside not knowing anything about it,

2018
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:18,510
it seems to me like everybody else is
laying back there waiting and they're

2019
01:00:18,511 --> 01:00:22,730
letting Donald just Jizz just letting
Donald get out there and fucking jerk off

2020
01:00:22,731 --> 01:00:23,750
and make all this noise.

2021
01:00:23,780 --> 01:00:24,920
No one's no other.

2022
01:00:25,010 --> 01:00:29,120
Republican's are being loud like
Jeb Bush is being very quiet.

2023
01:00:29,330 --> 01:00:30,190
No one's opposing him.

2024
01:00:30,900 --> 01:00:33,110
Let him act like a fool.

2025
01:00:33,170 --> 01:00:33,980
Chris Christie,

2026
01:00:33,980 --> 01:00:34,581
that guy,

2027
01:00:34,581 --> 01:00:37,220
he goes on the news and all
he does is talk about pot.

2028
01:00:37,430 --> 01:00:37,701
You know,

2029
01:00:37,701 --> 01:00:38,420
if you're,

2030
01:00:38,420 --> 01:00:41,960
if you're enjoying what he's trying
to do is trying to not be president.

2031
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:47,200
I think that slob has like some crazy
criminal fucking skeletons in his closet

2032
01:00:47,781 --> 01:00:50,960
from shit that he did in New Jersey
that's completely not kosher.

2033
01:00:51,260 --> 01:00:51,950
And he just like,

2034
01:00:51,950 --> 01:00:53,120
if he becomes president,

2035
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:54,380
all that Shit's going to leak out.

2036
01:00:54,381 --> 01:00:58,190
So I think he's trying to ruin it now
by like saying if you're smoking pot,

2037
01:00:58,220 --> 01:00:59,090
Colorado,

2038
01:00:59,220 --> 01:01:01,250
enjoy it now because when I'm president,

2039
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:02,570
all that stuff he's saying like,

2040
01:01:02,571 --> 01:01:03,830
why would you say stuff like that?

2041
01:01:03,831 --> 01:01:08,330
You know what popular opinion is popular
opinion is Colorado's making millions

2042
01:01:08,330 --> 01:01:09,890
of dollars a year in tax revenue.

2043
01:01:10,010 --> 01:01:12,830
They have the lowest incidence of
drunk driving they've ever reported.

2044
01:01:12,950 --> 01:01:14,600
They have lower incidents then uh,

2045
01:01:14,601 --> 01:01:17,300
in violent crime they've
had in a long fucking time.

2046
01:01:17,510 --> 01:01:19,460
And a lot of this is
attributed to marijuana.

2047
01:01:19,580 --> 01:01:21,840
So a rational fucking
person looking at that,

2048
01:01:21,841 --> 01:01:22,041
we'll say,

2049
01:01:22,041 --> 01:01:22,371
well look,

2050
01:01:22,371 --> 01:01:23,510
it's good money for the state.

2051
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:24,800
Even if you're conservative,

2052
01:01:24,980 --> 01:01:25,491
what do you want?

2053
01:01:25,491 --> 01:01:27,830
You want more tax revenue
so we can hire more cops,

2054
01:01:27,950 --> 01:01:28,783
more fire,

2055
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:30,050
more fire people,

2056
01:01:30,110 --> 01:01:31,580
more more teachers.

2057
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:32,151
That's like a,

2058
01:01:32,151 --> 01:01:33,410
what a conservative
person would look at it.

2059
01:01:33,411 --> 01:01:33,531
Like,

2060
01:01:33,531 --> 01:01:35,900
this is a smart way to do it
cause it's fiscally prudent.

2061
01:01:36,110 --> 01:01:41,110
But know that Slob in my state
fucking bagels fallen out of his face.

2062
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:45,710
Who could run for president?

2063
01:01:45,711 --> 01:01:46,790
There should be a weight limit.

2064
01:01:46,910 --> 01:01:47,181
No,

2065
01:01:47,181 --> 01:01:48,260
because you could be a giant.

2066
01:01:48,261 --> 01:01:48,891
It'd be awesome.

2067
01:01:48,891 --> 01:01:52,010
Like what if you're like some
seven foot two to waste 500 pounds.

2068
01:01:52,180 --> 01:01:52,491
Okay.

2069
01:01:52,491 --> 01:01:54,920
How about your proportionate
body fat percentage?

2070
01:01:54,921 --> 01:01:55,910
We would never let that happen.

2071
01:01:56,220 --> 01:02:00,800
If there was a seven foot two dude with
a giant fucking fire hydrant dick and he

2072
01:02:00,801 --> 01:02:03,410
wanted to be president and
he was smart in every way,

2073
01:02:03,411 --> 01:02:03,940
we'd be like,

2074
01:02:03,940 --> 01:02:04,773
hm,

2075
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:05,390
how do we,

2076
01:02:05,390 --> 01:02:06,820
how do we know his Dick was that?

2077
01:02:08,860 --> 01:02:11,120
Every time he talks Jon Hamm photo shoot,

2078
01:02:11,470 --> 01:02:14,300
he just stands there and he's got this
giant wad in his pants and everybody's

2079
01:02:14,330 --> 01:02:14,511
like,

2080
01:02:14,511 --> 01:02:15,260
I think,

2081
01:02:15,260 --> 01:02:19,410
I mean it's got to look at the signs of
them and they just assume they guys have

2082
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:20,250
big dicks.

2083
01:02:20,250 --> 01:02:21,600
Someone knows more than we do.

2084
01:02:22,110 --> 01:02:22,381
Oh,

2085
01:02:22,381 --> 01:02:23,520
is that your ratio?

2086
01:02:24,120 --> 01:02:24,481
I mean,

2087
01:02:24,481 --> 01:02:25,314
I'd be noticed.

2088
01:02:25,740 --> 01:02:26,131
I don't know.

2089
01:02:26,131 --> 01:02:26,560
I know.

2090
01:02:26,560 --> 01:02:27,600
I'm just guessing

2091
01:02:29,190 --> 01:02:30,000
because it just,

2092
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:30,833
it is what it,

2093
01:02:31,470 --> 01:02:32,460
it just wouldn't,

2094
01:02:33,060 --> 01:02:33,460
it wouldn't,

2095
01:02:33,460 --> 01:02:33,871
it wouldn't,

2096
01:02:33,871 --> 01:02:34,171
you know,

2097
01:02:34,171 --> 01:02:37,650
cause they already have the height so it
just wouldn't be fair for them to have

2098
01:02:37,651 --> 01:02:39,840
a big Dick and hike and get the girls.

2099
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:41,340
So you think the world's fair

2100
01:02:47,010 --> 01:02:50,010
giant heads and huge teeth
and antelopes on of guns.

2101
01:02:50,011 --> 01:02:51,480
This is not a fair world we're living in.

2102
01:02:51,481 --> 01:02:52,314
How dare you?

2103
01:02:52,840 --> 01:02:53,673
It doesn't make any sense.

2104
01:02:55,060 --> 01:02:56,710
I've seen short guys with big Dicks,

2105
01:02:56,711 --> 01:02:59,580
so I just assumed that tall
guys must have small dicks.

2106
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:00,540
Well that's good math.

2107
01:03:00,541 --> 01:03:01,560
You should probably,

2108
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:03,480
she probably worked for the governor then.

2109
01:03:03,940 --> 01:03:08,340
See I would think everything
is proportional to most
parts of your big tall guy

2110
01:03:08,341 --> 01:03:08,851
with big,

2111
01:03:08,851 --> 01:03:09,571
big feet.

2112
01:03:09,571 --> 01:03:13,040
You probably have a bigger
dick than a normal guy.

2113
01:03:13,850 --> 01:03:16,290
You're not thinking that well
that doesn't make any sense

2114
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:21,121
to you.

2115
01:03:21,121 --> 01:03:21,954
It makes sense.

2116
01:03:22,170 --> 01:03:23,310
As long as it makes sense to you.

2117
01:03:23,311 --> 01:03:27,240
See that means that you have fucked a
very couple of big tall guys and both of

2118
01:03:27,241 --> 01:03:27,421
them,

2119
01:03:27,421 --> 01:03:31,190
they're Dixon weren't as big as you
wanted and you're projecting it on.

2120
01:03:31,570 --> 01:03:35,390
I saw a tall guy with
a small penis one time.

2121
01:03:35,550 --> 01:03:36,383
One time.

2122
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:42,330
One time I saw a Chinese black girlfriend,

2123
01:03:43,290 --> 01:03:46,170
so I'm basing all Chinese
dudes date black girls.

2124
01:03:46,260 --> 01:03:46,930
I get what you're saying.

2125
01:03:46,930 --> 01:03:49,680
I think all Asian girls
have small vaginas like,

2126
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:51,360
like length wise.

2127
01:03:51,470 --> 01:03:51,820
Yeah,

2128
01:03:51,820 --> 01:03:52,320
that's a,

2129
01:03:52,320 --> 01:03:54,270
that's a actual stereotype.

2130
01:03:54,420 --> 01:03:55,900
It's like black eyes having big dicks.

2131
01:03:55,901 --> 01:03:56,380
That's a start.

2132
01:03:56,380 --> 01:03:57,870
Like you're not going out on a limb there,

2133
01:03:58,050 --> 01:04:00,990
but giant dudes have little dicks.

2134
01:04:01,290 --> 01:04:01,980
That's,

2135
01:04:01,980 --> 01:04:02,940
that doesn't make sense.

2136
01:04:02,970 --> 01:04:03,803
That's going on on

2137
01:04:06,440 --> 01:04:07,010
that day.

2138
01:04:07,010 --> 01:04:07,843
A little dicks.

2139
01:04:08,550 --> 01:04:09,383
How ironic.

2140
01:04:14,040 --> 01:04:15,120
Oh my God,

2141
01:04:16,790 --> 01:04:18,000
that is so ridiculous.

2142
01:04:19,230 --> 01:04:21,270
I love being stupid.

2143
01:04:22,140 --> 01:04:23,490
How long are you going to be in La for?

2144
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:24,570
Till Saturday.

2145
01:04:24,570 --> 01:04:25,351
You got gigs on here.

2146
01:04:25,351 --> 01:04:26,184
What are you doing?

2147
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:31,040
This is going on right now.

2148
01:04:33,690 --> 01:04:38,690
What is the Common Union Comedy Club?

2149
01:04:41,960 --> 01:04:42,793
Have you heard of it?

2150
01:04:47,270 --> 01:04:50,520
Do you have black comedy that you do
specifically for these African American

2151
01:04:50,521 --> 01:04:52,890
rooms or does it like
you just do your own act?

2152
01:04:55,240 --> 01:04:57,540
Do do a lot of these
African American rooms,

2153
01:04:58,590 --> 01:04:59,580
African American,

2154
01:05:00,630 --> 01:05:01,463
urban,

2155
01:05:02,280 --> 01:05:03,150
politically correct.

2156
01:05:07,110 --> 01:05:07,943
I

2157
01:05:08,990 --> 01:05:09,823
black rooms in New York.

2158
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:15,960
Why do you do a lot of them?

2159
01:05:15,970 --> 01:05:17,500
To just enjoy it because

2160
01:05:18,710 --> 01:05:19,630
they're so fun.

2161
01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:20,530
They're so fun.

2162
01:05:20,530 --> 01:05:21,363
Yeah,

2163
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:21,970
it's,

2164
01:05:21,970 --> 01:05:26,970
it's just you feel like you're
just like riding waves of laughter,

2165
01:05:27,580 --> 01:05:28,210
you know,

2166
01:05:28,210 --> 01:05:29,043
nonstop.

2167
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:30,430
Like they just laugh harder.

2168
01:05:30,670 --> 01:05:31,421
They definitely do.

2169
01:05:31,421 --> 01:05:32,254
But they also,

2170
01:05:32,260 --> 01:05:33,700
they get bored of you quick,

2171
01:05:33,730 --> 01:05:36,460
which is good because it
just makes you better.

2172
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:36,950
You know,

2173
01:05:36,950 --> 01:05:40,340
Chris Rock said that once that he did
a show with Martin Lawrence and then he

2174
01:05:40,341 --> 01:05:43,040
realized that he had been
doing too many white rooms.

2175
01:05:43,430 --> 01:05:44,960
He's like white people or to patient.

2176
01:05:45,350 --> 01:05:48,200
Like he did a black show with Martin
Lawrence and Martin Lawrence killed and he

2177
01:05:48,201 --> 01:05:49,730
had to go on after Martin
Lawrence and he was like,

2178
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:51,620
Oh snap shit.

2179
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:56,360
I better get back to the
black room because Martin
Lawrence in the 1990s fucking

2180
01:05:56,361 --> 01:05:57,194
monster.

2181
01:05:57,260 --> 01:05:58,250
A lot of people know him.

2182
01:05:58,430 --> 01:06:00,140
He's one of those guys ever seen him.

2183
01:06:00,680 --> 01:06:01,580
He's one of those guys,

2184
01:06:01,581 --> 01:06:02,271
a lot of people,

2185
01:06:02,271 --> 01:06:02,471
they,

2186
01:06:02,471 --> 01:06:05,150
they sleep on him now because
he kinda got a little bit,

2187
01:06:05,390 --> 01:06:06,230
he had some,

2188
01:06:06,290 --> 01:06:09,990
some issues with mental
health and the law.

2189
01:06:10,020 --> 01:06:10,820
Remember there was like,

2190
01:06:10,820 --> 01:06:14,030
he was running around with a wetsuit
on and yelling at people or something.

2191
01:06:14,040 --> 01:06:14,610
Remember that?

2192
01:06:14,610 --> 01:06:15,920
It was like d hydrated.

2193
01:06:15,921 --> 01:06:19,400
They were saying he was dehydrated and
saying a bunch of nutty shit and they

2194
01:06:19,401 --> 01:06:22,040
pulled them in for some sort of,

2195
01:06:22,041 --> 01:06:22,190
uh,

2196
01:06:22,190 --> 01:06:22,380
you know,

2197
01:06:22,380 --> 01:06:22,631
they,

2198
01:06:22,631 --> 01:06:24,140
they did ran some tests on him.

2199
01:06:24,140 --> 01:06:25,550
They wanted to find out what
the hell's wrong with him.

2200
01:06:25,551 --> 01:06:27,380
And then he kind of faded
off and did some movies,

2201
01:06:27,381 --> 01:06:29,570
but he kind of stopped doing
stand up until recently.

2202
01:06:30,110 --> 01:06:30,560
Yeah.

2203
01:06:30,560 --> 01:06:31,430
I forgot all about him.

2204
01:06:31,580 --> 01:06:32,610
Just started doing it again though.

2205
01:06:32,611 --> 01:06:34,190
I remember he was at the
store a few weeks ago.

2206
01:06:34,460 --> 01:06:34,611
Oh,

2207
01:06:34,611 --> 01:06:34,990
cool.

2208
01:06:34,990 --> 01:06:35,100
Yeah,

2209
01:06:35,100 --> 01:06:36,320
he was like doing the main room.

2210
01:06:36,321 --> 01:06:37,760
I didn't get a chance to see it though,

2211
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:38,833
but uh,

2212
01:06:38,970 --> 01:06:39,803
I heard it was good.

2213
01:06:40,100 --> 01:06:41,510
He was a fucking awesome when I was,

2214
01:06:41,540 --> 01:06:43,400
when I was starting out though in the 90s.

2215
01:06:43,430 --> 01:06:45,410
I used to have to go on after
him at the comedy store.

2216
01:06:46,980 --> 01:06:47,560
Oh my God.

2217
01:06:47,560 --> 01:06:48,080
Hey Dick.

2218
01:06:48,080 --> 01:06:48,913
Going on after him.

2219
01:06:49,040 --> 01:06:51,830
I ate dick when I went on
after him during this era,

2220
01:06:51,860 --> 01:06:53,180
during the you so crazy era.

2221
01:06:53,720 --> 01:06:54,201
I love that.

2222
01:06:54,201 --> 01:06:57,350
In extremely funny film where he got,

2223
01:06:57,440 --> 01:06:59,720
he's one of those guys that
got banned from MTV too,

2224
01:07:00,590 --> 01:07:01,070
didn't he?

2225
01:07:01,070 --> 01:07:03,050
He get banned for some of
the things that he said.

2226
01:07:03,051 --> 01:07:03,530
He was like,

2227
01:07:03,530 --> 01:07:06,530
it's something like made jokes
about tampons or something
like that and that was

2228
01:07:06,770 --> 01:07:11,060
Kurt Loder was liking Knopf
nothing when they banned dice clay.

2229
01:07:11,120 --> 01:07:13,340
Remember the band dice
clay for Di Deuce jokes?

2230
01:07:13,341 --> 01:07:14,174
Yeah,

2231
01:07:14,190 --> 01:07:15,230
enough.

2232
01:07:15,350 --> 01:07:19,640
Now they have whole episodes on tampons
on MTV course they do Kurt Loder.

2233
01:07:19,641 --> 01:07:20,474
Where's he at?

2234
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:22,100
I don't know.

2235
01:07:22,100 --> 01:07:24,530
Just try to be respectable
record store guy.

2236
01:07:24,890 --> 01:07:26,640
You know those guys that were like the,

2237
01:07:26,641 --> 01:07:27,920
the Djs of,

2238
01:07:28,010 --> 01:07:29,960
they were like the cool
record store clerks.

2239
01:07:30,230 --> 01:07:30,501
You know,

2240
01:07:30,501 --> 01:07:34,880
they kind of knew what was good and
what was not going to like cool Dj guys.

2241
01:07:34,881 --> 01:07:37,910
You know that like actually could
pick and choose the music they liked.

2242
01:07:38,300 --> 01:07:41,000
Like the old days when I used to
listen to radio when I was a kid,

2243
01:07:41,001 --> 01:07:43,190
Djs were stars because it,

2244
01:07:43,690 --> 01:07:47,700
no a Dj is the first famous
person I met will know a Dj like,

2245
01:07:49,450 --> 01:07:50,390
like a radio,

2246
01:07:50,430 --> 01:07:51,870
like the oldies channel Guy.

2247
01:07:51,871 --> 01:07:53,490
Who was the first one you met?

2248
01:07:53,550 --> 01:07:54,720
It was dick beyond a,

2249
01:07:55,500 --> 01:07:56,070
and he,

2250
01:07:56,070 --> 01:07:59,850
he was the DJ for the
Chicago oldies radio station.

2251
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:00,870
He's a famous guy.

2252
01:08:01,080 --> 01:08:02,700
Well to me he was famous.

2253
01:08:02,910 --> 01:08:04,680
He was famous like on the air in Chicago.

2254
01:08:04,740 --> 01:08:05,360
Yeah.

2255
01:08:05,360 --> 01:08:08,700
Like he was like Dick beyond
these forgotten the oldies.

2256
01:08:08,810 --> 01:08:08,941
Oh,

2257
01:08:08,941 --> 01:08:09,700
that's funny.

2258
01:08:09,700 --> 01:08:10,260
That's him.

2259
01:08:10,260 --> 01:08:11,093
There's Dick.

2260
01:08:11,160 --> 01:08:11,311
Yeah.

2261
01:08:11,311 --> 01:08:12,960
I went to a mattress store to meet Dixie.

2262
01:08:13,020 --> 01:08:15,060
Anandi does look exactly example.

2263
01:08:15,080 --> 01:08:15,913
That's hilarious.

2264
01:08:18,410 --> 01:08:19,260
That's hilarious.

2265
01:08:19,261 --> 01:08:20,630
It was a lot older than that.

2266
01:08:20,870 --> 01:08:24,290
Well that was drawn before
cameras were invented.

2267
01:08:25,250 --> 01:08:25,461
Yeah.

2268
01:08:25,461 --> 01:08:26,120
They um,

2269
01:08:26,120 --> 01:08:27,440
they used to be able to pick the music.

2270
01:08:27,500 --> 01:08:30,940
So those guys were the cool guys like
they used to play because I was like,

2271
01:08:31,130 --> 01:08:31,911
I love everything.

2272
01:08:31,911 --> 01:08:32,541
He pigs,

2273
01:08:32,541 --> 01:08:33,374
you know,

2274
01:08:33,510 --> 01:08:36,870
Sam Cooke and the beach boys and you know,

2275
01:08:36,890 --> 01:08:37,641
the carpenters.

2276
01:08:37,641 --> 01:08:39,080
I thought it was awesome and I was,

2277
01:08:39,081 --> 01:08:40,640
I used to really play records.

2278
01:08:41,170 --> 01:08:43,190
You don't at least
actually play the record.

2279
01:08:43,220 --> 01:08:44,090
There was at one point in time,

2280
01:08:44,091 --> 01:08:46,460
the DJ was the guy laying the needle down.

2281
01:08:47,480 --> 01:08:48,313
Think about that.

2282
01:08:49,310 --> 01:08:50,870
They used to pick the records here.

2283
01:08:50,871 --> 01:08:51,950
Mistakes probably.

2284
01:08:51,980 --> 01:08:52,370
Oh yeah,

2285
01:08:52,370 --> 01:08:54,320
I'm sure a lot Buhler dude.

2286
01:08:54,321 --> 01:08:55,190
When I was a kid,

2287
01:08:55,460 --> 01:08:58,460
you would listen to the radio and
you'd hear a fucking record skip.

2288
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:00,020
It would happen all the time.

2289
01:09:00,180 --> 01:09:01,400
It would happen all the time,

2290
01:09:01,760 --> 01:09:04,160
like once every couple months
or something like that.

2291
01:09:04,220 --> 01:09:06,920
Someone will be playing whole lot
of love or whatever and hold on,

2292
01:09:07,460 --> 01:09:08,293
hold on,

2293
01:09:08,380 --> 01:09:09,213
hold on.

2294
01:09:09,410 --> 01:09:10,140
Hello.

2295
01:09:10,140 --> 01:09:13,460
And no one would catch it
for like a minute or so.

2296
01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:16,310
And you would be like
working construction cycle.

2297
01:09:16,311 --> 01:09:17,720
What the fuck?

2298
01:09:17,900 --> 01:09:19,550
Jesus Christ get it right.

2299
01:09:19,551 --> 01:09:21,150
You fucks yelling at them.

2300
01:09:21,151 --> 01:09:25,340
And then finally someone would correct
it when I'm like a bathroom break and

2301
01:09:25,341 --> 01:09:28,820
just let the record like repeat
for like three minutes maybe.

2302
01:09:28,850 --> 01:09:29,780
Probably cigarettes.

2303
01:09:30,250 --> 01:09:30,750
They'd probably say,

2304
01:09:30,750 --> 01:09:32,800
well they probably smoking cigarettes
in the billings back though.

2305
01:09:32,801 --> 01:09:33,080
Yeah,

2306
01:09:33,080 --> 01:09:33,411
totally.

2307
01:09:33,411 --> 01:09:34,244
And the buildings.

2308
01:09:34,470 --> 01:09:37,430
Remember Greg Fitzsimmons telling about
his parents smoking cigarettes in the

2309
01:09:37,431 --> 01:09:38,900
house in the middle of the winter,

2310
01:09:39,020 --> 01:09:44,020
all the windows rolled up and solid tight
and he's just living as a little kid

2311
01:09:44,751 --> 01:09:46,580
in this house filled with chain smokers.

2312
01:09:46,840 --> 01:09:47,673
That's how my,

2313
01:09:48,170 --> 01:09:49,250
my best friend growing up,

2314
01:09:49,251 --> 01:09:51,770
his parents and I just stayed
at his house every single day.

2315
01:09:51,910 --> 01:09:55,790
And in the cars they would have the
windows rolled up in the cars during rain.

2316
01:09:56,030 --> 01:09:57,680
That's the thing about
those talk shows too.

2317
01:09:57,681 --> 01:10:00,050
They all used to smoke
cigarettes on the talk show.

2318
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:03,230
They'd all be sitting there like
Johnny Carson used to smoke cigarettes.

2319
01:10:03,350 --> 01:10:04,570
See if you can find a video of that.

2320
01:10:04,571 --> 01:10:08,930
Cause it's so weird to watch Johnny
Carson Smoking cigarettes on the tonight

2321
01:10:08,931 --> 01:10:12,860
show and be like guess would be there
and he would have an ash tray right there

2322
01:10:12,861 --> 01:10:17,861
and they would just now when we'd
is legalized in all 50 states,

2323
01:10:18,680 --> 01:10:20,960
then we'll just be smoking
weed on the tonight show.

2324
01:10:21,050 --> 01:10:21,381
No,

2325
01:10:21,381 --> 01:10:26,381
because you hotbox people you know like
that Gig and Toronto didn't wear a mask.

2326
01:10:28,830 --> 01:10:29,570
You know,

2327
01:10:29,570 --> 01:10:31,100
how about you don't smoke
weed in front of you?

2328
01:10:31,101 --> 01:10:35,150
I might just have an edible or smoke
outside or like some host will just be

2329
01:10:35,151 --> 01:10:36,050
smoking weed.

2330
01:10:36,980 --> 01:10:37,361
Look at you.

2331
01:10:37,361 --> 01:10:41,330
Imagine if you were in a bar and the
other people drinking got you drunk,

2332
01:10:42,500 --> 01:10:43,340
that'd be fucked.

2333
01:10:43,460 --> 01:10:44,293
Right.

2334
01:10:44,300 --> 01:10:45,380
That's what it's like with weed.

2335
01:10:45,470 --> 01:10:47,180
The other people getting
high literally get you high,

2336
01:10:47,181 --> 01:10:48,150
like secondhand highs.

2337
01:10:48,170 --> 01:10:49,190
Real is it?

2338
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:49,520
Like,

2339
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:50,300
I always wondered,

2340
01:10:50,300 --> 01:10:52,940
cause I swear to God I read
something once where they said no,

2341
01:10:52,941 --> 01:10:54,530
once it's in your mouth,

2342
01:10:54,860 --> 01:10:58,700
it's totally everything that
you're blowing out is absorbed,

2343
01:10:58,860 --> 01:10:59,360
uh,

2344
01:10:59,360 --> 01:11:00,193
from weed.

2345
01:11:00,260 --> 01:11:00,800
That's not true.

2346
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:01,280
It's not.

2347
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:01,641
No,

2348
01:11:01,641 --> 01:11:02,780
definitely not that.

2349
01:11:02,781 --> 01:11:03,021
You know,

2350
01:11:03,021 --> 01:11:04,970
it's proof positive that
God damn Toronto Room.

2351
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:05,211
Yeah,

2352
01:11:05,211 --> 01:11:05,721
exactly.

2353
01:11:05,721 --> 01:11:07,430
That's the only reason I believe it.

2354
01:11:07,580 --> 01:11:11,620
The people have gone up that were stone
cold sober and they got hot box and that

2355
01:11:11,630 --> 01:11:13,010
Toronto Room people been in his,

2356
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:14,340
this podcast studio

2357
01:11:14,340 --> 01:11:15,173
and got hotbox.

2358
01:11:15,180 --> 01:11:16,680
I think [inaudible] got hot box.

2359
01:11:16,920 --> 01:11:17,753
I'm pretty sure.

2360
01:11:17,790 --> 01:11:19,710
I'm pretty sure if Greg got hotbox too.

2361
01:11:20,310 --> 01:11:20,521
Yeah.

2362
01:11:20,521 --> 01:11:22,720
You get hotbox to hotbox is real.

2363
01:11:22,860 --> 01:11:24,250
Anybody that says nodded you.

2364
01:11:24,360 --> 01:11:25,680
You haven't done any tests.

2365
01:11:26,010 --> 01:11:26,790
They're liars.

2366
01:11:26,790 --> 01:11:28,440
We always used to clam bake growing up.

2367
01:11:28,470 --> 01:11:29,460
We believed it growing up.

2368
01:11:29,850 --> 01:11:31,590
I think Ed Mcmahon was ass drunk.

2369
01:11:31,860 --> 01:11:35,730
Jake Elrich senior on the tonight
show with Johnny Carson play this.

2370
01:11:36,580 --> 01:11:39,300
We hear these guys talking
back then look at Johnny.

2371
01:11:39,390 --> 01:11:40,223
The amendment.

2372
01:11:41,190 --> 01:11:45,690
Look at this and there some time ago
was a book put out by United States and

2373
01:11:45,691 --> 01:11:46,524
Canada.

2374
01:11:46,770 --> 01:11:47,780
Most all of the book,

2375
01:11:48,140 --> 01:11:53,140
both smoking and with the
committee hearing Rehab and
it was only one chapter in

2376
01:11:55,051 --> 01:11:58,920
the book was worth considering
and then was way he said

2377
01:12:00,380 --> 01:12:03,080
[inaudible]

2378
01:12:04,170 --> 01:12:06,330
right under the fifth amendment.

2379
01:12:08,520 --> 01:12:13,520
The Fifth Amendment is not good law if
we are to be called criminals because we

2380
01:12:14,191 --> 01:12:18,030
use it and then let you take
it out of the constitution.

2381
01:12:18,031 --> 01:12:18,870
Let's get rid of it.

2382
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:20,010
What's the Fifth Amendment?

2383
01:12:20,340 --> 01:12:23,010
Recall history of the reading
of history right there.

2384
01:12:23,660 --> 01:12:24,321
Any guesses?

2385
01:12:24,321 --> 01:12:25,830
Some difficulties with the,

2386
01:12:26,180 --> 01:12:27,720
with Greg

2387
01:12:29,260 --> 01:12:31,660
proceedings where they fall down,

2388
01:12:31,820 --> 01:12:36,820
no person shall be held to answer for a
capital or otherwise infamous crime and

2389
01:12:37,371 --> 01:12:42,371
less on the present or indictment
of a grand jury against them.

2390
01:12:42,950 --> 01:12:44,610
Still that no person,

2391
01:12:45,310 --> 01:12:50,310
a present moment or indictment of a grand
jury except in cases are rising in the

2392
01:12:51,771 --> 01:12:53,990
land or naval forces or militia.

2393
01:12:53,991 --> 01:12:54,824
Huh?

2394
01:12:54,930 --> 01:12:57,860
I'm not sure I have a good one.

2395
01:12:58,280 --> 01:13:00,830
Pleading the fifth means
you're not supposed to talk,

2396
01:13:00,831 --> 01:13:01,161
right?

2397
01:13:01,161 --> 01:13:03,200
You plead the fifth
you don't have to talk.

2398
01:13:03,770 --> 01:13:04,603
That's what it is.

2399
01:13:04,610 --> 01:13:08,090
It protects the person against
being compelled to a witness stand.

2400
01:13:08,720 --> 01:13:09,021
Okay.

2401
01:13:09,021 --> 01:13:11,660
Himself or herself in a criminal case.

2402
01:13:11,780 --> 01:13:14,150
How weird is that that
we have a law like that?

2403
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:15,920
Like yeah,

2404
01:13:16,360 --> 01:13:18,020
it was that like if you're a gent,

2405
01:13:18,021 --> 01:13:19,520
non gender specific person.

2406
01:13:20,750 --> 01:13:21,390
Oh,

2407
01:13:21,390 --> 01:13:22,250
but he's uh,

2408
01:13:22,280 --> 01:13:23,120
he's still a dude.

2409
01:13:23,120 --> 01:13:23,953
He was banging that check.

2410
01:13:25,460 --> 01:13:26,050
Right.

2411
01:13:26,050 --> 01:13:27,560
Maybe that's why she was sticking around.

2412
01:13:27,770 --> 01:13:28,850
Maybe it was a tentacle.

2413
01:13:28,970 --> 01:13:29,990
That's why she came back.

2414
01:13:30,200 --> 01:13:31,490
See if he came back to life again.

2415
01:13:31,880 --> 01:13:32,870
Bring that Dick back.

2416
01:13:33,710 --> 01:13:36,070
I want a social security
number for Jeffrey Lash.

2417
01:13:36,920 --> 01:13:38,930
What a weird thing it is that you can say,

2418
01:13:38,931 --> 01:13:41,030
I don't want to testify like Esther,

2419
01:13:41,031 --> 01:13:41,411
you know,

2420
01:13:41,411 --> 01:13:41,660
uh,

2421
01:13:41,660 --> 01:13:45,410
we caught you with a kilo of
cocaine and you got a gun and uh,

2422
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:46,273
how do you plead?

2423
01:13:46,430 --> 01:13:47,270
I plead the fifth.

2424
01:13:47,900 --> 01:13:48,770
You don't have to talk.

2425
01:13:49,130 --> 01:13:49,401
And they,

2426
01:13:49,401 --> 01:13:51,260
then they decide whether
or not you're guilty.

2427
01:13:52,780 --> 01:13:54,330
Look at what a great country we live in.

2428
01:13:55,680 --> 01:13:57,680
Just seems a very bizarre,

2429
01:13:58,010 --> 01:14:00,550
that seems very bizarre
that you shouldn't have to

2430
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:05,233
plead the fifth.

2431
01:14:06,550 --> 01:14:09,050
You can because you kind of
have the court of your own life.

2432
01:14:09,080 --> 01:14:09,411
It's just,

2433
01:14:09,411 --> 01:14:10,400
it's not going to fly.

2434
01:14:10,670 --> 01:14:11,190
Most people,

2435
01:14:11,190 --> 01:14:11,980
not most people

2436
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:12,640
are going to go,

2437
01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:15,130
they're going to bang that malate order.

2438
01:14:15,580 --> 01:14:16,450
Ordering the court.

2439
01:14:16,660 --> 01:14:18,400
Who's fucking underwear is this again?

2440
01:14:18,910 --> 01:14:20,200
There's no one put a gun to your head.

2441
01:14:20,410 --> 01:14:21,850
There's no fifth in this house.

2442
01:14:23,350 --> 01:14:23,840
Yeah,

2443
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:24,760
plead the fifth.

2444
01:14:25,090 --> 01:14:26,290
That's a weird thing to be able to do.

2445
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:28,660
Like if you got caught with a dead body,

2446
01:14:29,170 --> 01:14:32,110
you don't have to talk and then they
decide whether or not you're guilty.

2447
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:34,150
Ever really hold up in court course.

2448
01:14:34,160 --> 01:14:35,020
Those fifth,

2449
01:14:35,290 --> 01:14:36,970
fifth a productive

2450
01:14:38,550 --> 01:14:39,383
Dave Chappelle.

2451
01:14:39,460 --> 01:14:39,791
Yeah.

2452
01:14:39,791 --> 01:14:40,780
It holds up in court.

2453
01:14:41,030 --> 01:14:41,310
Yeah,

2454
01:14:41,310 --> 01:14:41,740
it's,

2455
01:14:41,740 --> 01:14:42,071
that's a,

2456
01:14:42,071 --> 01:14:43,630
that's an amendment to the constitution.

2457
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:45,050
I don't know if they,

2458
01:14:45,051 --> 01:14:46,810
you can be compelled to testify.

2459
01:14:46,811 --> 01:14:47,130
I don't.

2460
01:14:47,130 --> 01:14:47,670
There's a,

2461
01:14:47,670 --> 01:14:50,320
there are times we can
be compelled to answer.

2462
01:14:50,321 --> 01:14:50,770
I don't know.

2463
01:14:50,770 --> 01:14:51,160
No,

2464
01:14:51,160 --> 01:14:54,520
you can just sit there and say
nothing and be put in a whole,

2465
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:55,540
yeah,

2466
01:14:55,540 --> 01:14:55,961
I guess.

2467
01:14:55,961 --> 01:14:56,291
All right.

2468
01:14:56,291 --> 01:14:58,420
They can't force you to talk
Farris who have just written,

2469
01:14:58,421 --> 01:15:00,670
plead the fifth to every
question that they've asked.

2470
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:01,390
I'm sure.

2471
01:15:01,390 --> 01:15:03,400
Well that's why like when
should night gets arrested,

2472
01:15:03,401 --> 01:15:04,234
he falls down,

2473
01:15:04,390 --> 01:15:05,200
falls down,

2474
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:06,340
pretends he's blacking out.

2475
01:15:07,030 --> 01:15:07,870
Like that's what he does.

2476
01:15:07,871 --> 01:15:12,010
Like whenever they like say like
he's getting sentenced to bill bales,

2477
01:15:12,011 --> 01:15:15,910
10 million bucks collapses like so they
have to take him out of there and then

2478
01:15:15,911 --> 01:15:19,210
they have to take him to the infirmary
and they have to breathing hard.

2479
01:15:19,300 --> 01:15:22,380
I think it's better to be in medical
care than it is to be in the cell.

2480
01:15:22,381 --> 01:15:23,290
So if you're smart,

2481
01:15:23,710 --> 01:15:24,880
every time they sentence,

2482
01:15:24,881 --> 01:15:27,810
you just fucking have a seizure nose.

2483
01:15:28,690 --> 01:15:29,980
You don't have to even show them.

2484
01:15:30,080 --> 01:15:31,210
Just fall down.

2485
01:15:31,570 --> 01:15:32,381
Just I can't breathe.

2486
01:15:32,381 --> 01:15:33,730
I can't just fall down.

2487
01:15:34,050 --> 01:15:35,470
Just fall down and you
just say you're weak.

2488
01:15:35,500 --> 01:15:36,160
I'm blocking out.

2489
01:15:36,160 --> 01:15:37,390
They can't prove you're not blacking out.

2490
01:15:37,660 --> 01:15:40,240
So they have to take you to the
doctor and take care of you.

2491
01:15:40,570 --> 01:15:41,240
Oh,

2492
01:15:41,240 --> 01:15:41,620
what did

2493
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:42,311
great idea.

2494
01:15:42,311 --> 01:15:43,360
I love falling down.

2495
01:15:43,390 --> 01:15:43,841
He's a dude,

2496
01:15:43,841 --> 01:15:44,710
has been around the block,

2497
01:15:45,910 --> 01:15:47,170
love falling down.

2498
01:15:47,680 --> 01:15:52,680
I read a book on how to
prevent osteoporosis and
there's an entire chapter on

2499
01:15:53,170 --> 01:15:54,400
how not to fall down.

2500
01:15:55,490 --> 01:15:55,990
What?

2501
01:15:55,990 --> 01:15:56,590
Yeah,

2502
01:15:56,590 --> 01:15:58,870
that because US oil,

2503
01:15:58,871 --> 01:15:59,231
they say,

2504
01:15:59,231 --> 01:16:00,010
what's the advice?

2505
01:16:00,010 --> 01:16:02,740
They say a walk slowly and

2506
01:16:06,040 --> 01:16:08,830
your doctor talk to her ass hole.

2507
01:16:10,180 --> 01:16:11,650
Whenever there's handrails,

2508
01:16:11,651 --> 01:16:13,060
hold on to the hand rails.

2509
01:16:13,330 --> 01:16:17,170
And if there's no handrail
hold onto the wall or a person.

2510
01:16:18,940 --> 01:16:19,870
Why were you reading this?

2511
01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:22,940
Because I like reading
on how to be healthy.

2512
01:16:23,220 --> 01:16:24,230
It's all right.

2513
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:24,910
I like,

2514
01:16:24,910 --> 01:16:25,390
I like,

2515
01:16:25,390 --> 01:16:27,250
I like being able to prevent the season,

2516
01:16:29,020 --> 01:16:31,900
the idea that it's just like walk slowly.

2517
01:16:31,960 --> 01:16:33,100
Oh okay.

2518
01:16:35,740 --> 01:16:37,000
I was running around and I was

2519
01:16:37,620 --> 01:16:38,310
like if I had,

2520
01:16:38,310 --> 01:16:41,580
if I had a choice between buying a house
with stairs and buying a house with no

2521
01:16:41,581 --> 01:16:42,414
stairs,

2522
01:16:42,420 --> 01:16:43,200
I would,

2523
01:16:43,200 --> 01:16:46,530
because I've read that book
and because I know that,

2524
01:16:46,710 --> 01:16:47,420
you know,

2525
01:16:47,420 --> 01:16:47,630
ask,

2526
01:16:47,630 --> 01:16:48,463
do you like,

2527
01:16:48,750 --> 01:16:49,500
like you know,

2528
01:16:49,500 --> 01:16:52,200
falling down does weaken your bones.

2529
01:16:53,460 --> 01:16:55,330
I would rather buy crest.

2530
01:16:55,530 --> 01:16:55,821
Esther,

2531
01:16:55,821 --> 01:16:57,120
how have you made it so far?

2532
01:16:58,160 --> 01:16:58,921
That's seriously.

2533
01:16:58,921 --> 01:17:00,480
How have you made it this far in life,

2534
01:17:02,020 --> 01:17:02,940
this kind of logic?

2535
01:17:02,941 --> 01:17:03,774
How are you here?

2536
01:17:03,960 --> 01:17:04,800
Fully dressed.

2537
01:17:04,801 --> 01:17:05,634
Fed.

2538
01:17:06,580 --> 01:17:07,510
You have a car?

2539
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:09,671
No,

2540
01:17:09,671 --> 01:17:10,504
for real.

2541
01:17:11,030 --> 01:17:11,271
No,

2542
01:17:11,271 --> 01:17:11,811
for real.

2543
01:17:11,811 --> 01:17:13,580
It makes it wouldn't have stairs.

2544
01:17:13,581 --> 01:17:15,940
I've got it figured I'm going to walk

2545
01:17:18,700 --> 01:17:22,550
away from tall guys because they might
have little to the probability of you

2546
01:17:22,551 --> 01:17:26,270
falling if you live in a just
a one level house is lower.

2547
01:17:26,300 --> 01:17:27,133
So

2548
01:17:27,140 --> 01:17:27,530
true.

2549
01:17:27,530 --> 01:17:30,530
Cause a lot of times people don't
fall downstairs all the time.

2550
01:17:30,531 --> 01:17:31,610
People fall in the kitchen,

2551
01:17:31,611 --> 01:17:32,630
they fall getting out of the tub.

2552
01:17:32,631 --> 01:17:33,464
That's a big one.

2553
01:17:33,510 --> 01:17:34,720
Stairs getting out of town.

2554
01:17:34,730 --> 01:17:36,030
Almost fall in my tub.

2555
01:17:36,031 --> 01:17:37,040
But like every time I get in it

2556
01:17:37,250 --> 01:17:37,460
Mike,

2557
01:17:37,460 --> 01:17:38,070
oh shit.

2558
01:17:38,070 --> 01:17:39,920
I must Darren friend who fell in her tub.

2559
01:17:39,921 --> 01:17:40,880
She broke ribs.

2560
01:17:40,881 --> 01:17:41,714
Shit.

2561
01:17:42,320 --> 01:17:42,690
Yeah,

2562
01:17:42,690 --> 01:17:45,780
you can get fucked up and
breaking ribs is our bomber.

2563
01:17:45,810 --> 01:17:46,950
You ever broken a rib now?

2564
01:17:46,951 --> 01:17:47,850
I haven't broken anything.

2565
01:17:47,970 --> 01:17:48,803
I broke,

2566
01:17:49,020 --> 01:17:52,860
I broke ribs at least at least two times.

2567
01:17:52,950 --> 01:17:53,790
I think more.

2568
01:17:53,970 --> 01:17:55,050
I think I broken a more,

2569
01:17:55,140 --> 01:17:59,010
but I've also broken the cartilage in
between the ribs at least six or seven

2570
01:17:59,011 --> 01:17:59,531
times.

2571
01:17:59,531 --> 01:18:00,030
Yes.

2572
01:18:00,030 --> 01:18:03,600
What mostly martial arts
people were punching you?

2573
01:18:03,630 --> 01:18:04,350
Kicking him.

2574
01:18:04,350 --> 01:18:05,490
Kicking you is a big one.

2575
01:18:05,580 --> 01:18:06,180
Wow.

2576
01:18:06,180 --> 01:18:09,150
The set that what happens is
the rebs even if the ribs,

2577
01:18:09,270 --> 01:18:09,841
the ribs,

2578
01:18:09,841 --> 01:18:11,220
even if the ribs don't break,

2579
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:14,610
what happens is you get kicked
really hard and the separate,

2580
01:18:14,970 --> 01:18:15,471
so the,

2581
01:18:15,471 --> 01:18:15,690
the,

2582
01:18:15,690 --> 01:18:20,690
the cartilage in between the ribs
breaks and so then it pops like when you

2583
01:18:20,941 --> 01:18:21,421
breathe,

2584
01:18:21,421 --> 01:18:25,170
you could feel it moving and you have
to wait till that bitch stops moving and

2585
01:18:25,171 --> 01:18:26,370
you have to wait till it to heal up.

2586
01:18:26,370 --> 01:18:29,370
So it's months and months and months
where you can do anything when you smoke

2587
01:18:29,371 --> 01:18:30,204
weed.

2588
01:18:30,300 --> 01:18:31,590
This is before I was smoking weed.

2589
01:18:31,640 --> 01:18:32,270
Oh.

2590
01:18:32,270 --> 01:18:32,700
So,

2591
01:18:32,700 --> 01:18:35,940
but I would imagine you could smoke weed
but it's going to fucking hurt anytime

2592
01:18:35,941 --> 01:18:36,361
you do that,

2593
01:18:36,361 --> 01:18:36,931
it's going to hurt.

2594
01:18:36,931 --> 01:18:38,910
Like anything we expand that same aisle,

2595
01:18:38,911 --> 01:18:39,390
ribs,

2596
01:18:39,390 --> 01:18:40,650
any movement.

2597
01:18:40,860 --> 01:18:42,930
Like that was a thing like Josie Aldo,

2598
01:18:43,090 --> 01:18:46,410
one of the UFC fighters had a pullout
of his title five cause he got a broken

2599
01:18:46,411 --> 01:18:47,190
rib.

2600
01:18:47,190 --> 01:18:48,000
And uh,

2601
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:48,511
they were saying,

2602
01:18:48,511 --> 01:18:50,640
well he's going to try to
rest and try to heal up,

2603
01:18:50,641 --> 01:18:51,690
but you can't even,

2604
01:18:52,080 --> 01:18:53,070
you can't even exercise.

2605
01:18:53,071 --> 01:18:54,030
Like he would gain weight.

2606
01:18:54,070 --> 01:18:55,380
You'd never be able to make weight.

2607
01:18:55,560 --> 01:18:58,170
You can't do any kind of training and
if anybody hits you in that rib again,

2608
01:18:58,200 --> 01:18:59,033
you're fucked.

2609
01:18:59,130 --> 01:18:59,431
Like it's,

2610
01:18:59,431 --> 01:19:00,480
it's super dangerous.

2611
01:19:00,481 --> 01:19:03,420
Like the rib can actually break
loose and go into your organs.

2612
01:19:03,690 --> 01:19:07,770
It's like the whole design of that thing
is a cage around your internal organs,

2613
01:19:08,100 --> 01:19:09,660
but it's pliable.

2614
01:19:09,770 --> 01:19:13,860
So you rather get paid in the ribs or get
a concussion and brighten the ribs all

2615
01:19:13,860 --> 01:19:14,180
day.

2616
01:19:14,180 --> 01:19:14,820
100%.

2617
01:19:14,820 --> 01:19:15,270
Yeah.

2618
01:19:15,270 --> 01:19:15,870
Yeah,

2619
01:19:15,870 --> 01:19:16,081
yeah.

2620
01:19:16,081 --> 01:19:17,340
I would rather have the pain.

2621
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:19,560
The pain of getting a broken rib.

2622
01:19:19,590 --> 01:19:19,831
I mean,

2623
01:19:19,831 --> 01:19:21,960
you'd still do damage
to your organs and shit,

2624
01:19:21,961 --> 01:19:24,750
but damage to your head is a
totally different ballgame.

2625
01:19:25,170 --> 01:19:26,730
Damage to your head is very fucking day.

2626
01:19:26,790 --> 01:19:28,460
I've had damage to my head and no,

2627
01:19:32,140 --> 01:19:33,130
how recently,

2628
01:19:33,400 --> 01:19:34,510
right before they show,

2629
01:19:35,820 --> 01:19:36,670
but I can't remember.

2630
01:19:37,740 --> 01:19:38,020
No.

2631
01:19:38,020 --> 01:19:41,230
Like a few years ago I had a concussion.

2632
01:19:41,260 --> 01:19:41,621
Really?

2633
01:19:41,621 --> 01:19:42,430
What happened?

2634
01:19:42,430 --> 01:19:43,570
I got mugged in New York.

2635
01:19:43,720 --> 01:19:44,370
No Shit.

2636
01:19:44,370 --> 01:19:44,980
Yeah.

2637
01:19:44,980 --> 01:19:45,813
What happened?

2638
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:46,241
Um,

2639
01:19:46,241 --> 01:19:50,590
I was walking to a show and I
blame this purse that I bought.

2640
01:19:50,920 --> 01:19:55,920
I bought like a vintage beautiful coach
purse and that was like my first fancy

2641
01:19:56,351 --> 01:19:56,741
purse,

2642
01:19:56,741 --> 01:19:57,430
you know,

2643
01:19:57,430 --> 01:19:58,870
some walking to his show.

2644
01:19:58,871 --> 01:20:03,460
And I have this purse and all of
a sudden I'm just knocked out.

2645
01:20:04,330 --> 01:20:07,770
Like I don't remember what happened
and I never saw who hate me,

2646
01:20:07,771 --> 01:20:11,190
but somebody hit me on the head
and I was just like on the ground.

2647
01:20:11,290 --> 01:20:12,550
Oh yeah,

2648
01:20:14,010 --> 01:20:14,460
it,

2649
01:20:14,460 --> 01:20:17,610
it was in Bushwick on like
near the grand street.

2650
01:20:17,670 --> 01:20:18,503
L Stop.

2651
01:20:18,810 --> 01:20:19,420
What is Bush?

2652
01:20:19,420 --> 01:20:21,180
That Brooklyn is Brooklyn and yeah,

2653
01:20:21,181 --> 01:20:22,990
it's like past Williamsburg.

2654
01:20:24,520 --> 01:20:25,353
Yeah.

2655
01:20:25,860 --> 01:20:26,800
It's like where are all these?

2656
01:20:26,801 --> 01:20:29,070
Like artists are building
lofts and you know,

2657
01:20:29,100 --> 01:20:30,380
because it has studios.

2658
01:20:30,390 --> 01:20:30,661
Yeah.

2659
01:20:30,661 --> 01:20:32,580
And there's a bunch of art
studios and stuff there,

2660
01:20:32,860 --> 01:20:34,560
but it's still like,

2661
01:20:34,920 --> 01:20:35,251
you know,

2662
01:20:35,251 --> 01:20:36,240
a tough neighborhood.

2663
01:20:36,360 --> 01:20:40,200
So there was like nobody on the street
because it was like a Sunday at like 6:00

2664
01:20:40,200 --> 01:20:41,033
PM or something.

2665
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:43,140
And so you have no idea what happened?

2666
01:20:43,470 --> 01:20:43,681
Yeah.

2667
01:20:43,681 --> 01:20:45,480
I never saw you call the police.

2668
01:20:46,170 --> 01:20:46,411
No,

2669
01:20:46,411 --> 01:20:51,411
I woke up in some lady's apartment and
the police were already there and it was

2670
01:20:51,841 --> 01:20:55,560
like a super seventies apartment
and I was like looking at them,

2671
01:20:55,670 --> 01:20:56,580
I didn't know where I,

2672
01:20:56,640 --> 01:20:57,151
you know what I mean?

2673
01:20:57,151 --> 01:20:59,310
It was like my first time blacking out.

2674
01:20:59,670 --> 01:21:01,800
So I just like was looking at them like,

2675
01:21:01,850 --> 01:21:02,440
who are you?

2676
01:21:02,440 --> 01:21:03,060
Why,

2677
01:21:03,060 --> 01:21:03,750
what am I doing?

2678
01:21:03,750 --> 01:21:05,370
Like I felt like I was
in the twilight zone.

2679
01:21:05,830 --> 01:21:06,663
Where did you get hit?

2680
01:21:06,670 --> 01:21:07,470
You know?

2681
01:21:07,470 --> 01:21:08,160
Um,

2682
01:21:08,160 --> 01:21:09,240
I had a black eye,

2683
01:21:09,241 --> 01:21:11,400
so probably like up here somewhere.

2684
01:21:12,120 --> 01:21:12,690
Wow.

2685
01:21:12,690 --> 01:21:13,380
Yeah.

2686
01:21:13,380 --> 01:21:14,213
Nobody saw it.

2687
01:21:14,760 --> 01:21:15,450
Nobody saw it.

2688
01:21:15,450 --> 01:21:18,030
This lady heard me scream
and called the cops.

2689
01:21:18,390 --> 01:21:19,223
She screamed.

2690
01:21:19,410 --> 01:21:20,041
I screamed.

2691
01:21:20,041 --> 01:21:20,520
Yeah.

2692
01:21:20,520 --> 01:21:21,353
Huh.

2693
01:21:21,870 --> 01:21:23,890
And they ran off and my
purse was still there.

2694
01:21:25,120 --> 01:21:25,650
Yeah,

2695
01:21:25,650 --> 01:21:28,350
he got scared probably cause
I screamed really loud.

2696
01:21:29,070 --> 01:21:29,640
Yeah.

2697
01:21:29,640 --> 01:21:30,900
So you don't remember screaming?

2698
01:21:30,910 --> 01:21:31,800
You don't remember anything?

2699
01:21:31,801 --> 01:21:32,280
You don't know?

2700
01:21:32,280 --> 01:21:33,450
I don't remember screaming.

2701
01:21:34,320 --> 01:21:38,310
You must have been probably fighting
with them to try to keep your purse and

2702
01:21:38,311 --> 01:21:41,850
then you got hit because if he got knocked
out you wouldn't feel a scream after

2703
01:21:41,851 --> 01:21:42,684
you got knocked out.

2704
01:21:42,780 --> 01:21:43,613
Right?

2705
01:21:44,040 --> 01:21:44,760
Maybe,

2706
01:21:44,760 --> 01:21:46,110
but I don't remember anything.

2707
01:21:46,300 --> 01:21:46,890
Wow.

2708
01:21:46,890 --> 01:21:47,370
Yeah.

2709
01:21:47,370 --> 01:21:48,060
That's fucked.

2710
01:21:48,060 --> 01:21:48,930
When did this happen?

2711
01:21:49,410 --> 01:21:50,243
Um,

2712
01:21:50,370 --> 01:21:52,980
like maybe four or five years ago.

2713
01:21:52,981 --> 01:21:53,740
Five years ago.

2714
01:21:53,740 --> 01:21:57,410
So God damn scary to someone over a purse.

2715
01:21:58,230 --> 01:21:58,471
I mean,

2716
01:21:58,471 --> 01:21:59,790
I'm assuming it was a purse,

2717
01:21:59,791 --> 01:22:00,241
you know,

2718
01:22:00,241 --> 01:22:01,380
but who knows what they,

2719
01:22:02,760 --> 01:22:03,600
why they were doing it.

2720
01:22:03,601 --> 01:22:03,900
Some,

2721
01:22:03,900 --> 01:22:05,590
like they say that there's like a,

2722
01:22:06,040 --> 01:22:07,110
a knockout game,

2723
01:22:07,530 --> 01:22:07,891
you know,

2724
01:22:07,891 --> 01:22:10,290
where people just go around like
knocking people out for fun.

2725
01:22:10,720 --> 01:22:11,553
I've seen that.

2726
01:22:12,090 --> 01:22:15,900
That might've been Nicole about the time
period where that was going on also.

2727
01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:16,880
Yeah.

2728
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:18,450
So I don't know if that's,

2729
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:19,620
and there was no video of it,

2730
01:22:19,621 --> 01:22:19,861
you know,

2731
01:22:19,861 --> 01:22:21,480
it was just a residential block,

2732
01:22:22,410 --> 01:22:24,870
so it's horrible.

2733
01:22:25,260 --> 01:22:25,920
Yeah.

2734
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:27,450
How long did it take before you recovered?

2735
01:22:27,870 --> 01:22:29,280
A few months.

2736
01:22:29,490 --> 01:22:30,570
Jesus Christ.

2737
01:22:30,590 --> 01:22:31,030
Yeah.

2738
01:22:31,030 --> 01:22:32,130
It happened like,

2739
01:22:33,570 --> 01:22:35,370
like I would like want
to go to comedy shows,

2740
01:22:35,371 --> 01:22:37,290
but I didn't want to like
show up with a black eye,

2741
01:22:37,620 --> 01:22:38,453
you know?

2742
01:22:39,180 --> 01:22:40,950
So I just like stayed home.

2743
01:22:40,990 --> 01:22:41,823
But what about your head?

2744
01:22:43,320 --> 01:22:44,153
Um,

2745
01:22:44,790 --> 01:22:45,121
you know,

2746
01:22:45,121 --> 01:22:46,920
the cops just said I was really lucky.

2747
01:22:47,550 --> 01:22:49,710
They just kept saying that like
nothing else happened to me,

2748
01:22:49,740 --> 01:22:50,573
you know,

2749
01:22:50,580 --> 01:22:53,340
so I felt fine because I didn't,

2750
01:22:53,620 --> 01:22:53,900
I didn't,

2751
01:22:53,900 --> 01:22:56,790
I never saw anybody coming
after me with like a poll or,

2752
01:22:57,030 --> 01:22:57,863
you know what I mean?

2753
01:22:58,080 --> 01:22:58,913
Like,

2754
01:22:59,870 --> 01:23:00,840
so you just woke up,

2755
01:23:00,940 --> 01:23:01,380
it,

2756
01:23:01,380 --> 01:23:05,290
it wasn't so traumatizing because
I never remembered what happened.

2757
01:23:05,350 --> 01:23:06,160
Did you always feel

2758
01:23:06,160 --> 01:23:08,980
weird about looking around now
while you're walking after that?

2759
01:23:09,070 --> 01:23:09,611
Yeah.

2760
01:23:09,611 --> 01:23:11,110
Now I got a body guard,

2761
01:23:11,111 --> 01:23:11,944
you know,

2762
01:23:12,520 --> 01:23:13,320
traveling for you.

2763
01:23:13,320 --> 01:23:14,153
Looking at Brian,

2764
01:23:15,160 --> 01:23:17,030
if that's your bodyguard.

2765
01:23:17,110 --> 01:23:17,470
No,

2766
01:23:17,470 --> 01:23:20,050
you gotta tell me specifically what
you're planning on doing with them.

2767
01:23:22,420 --> 01:23:22,691
Yeah.

2768
01:23:22,691 --> 01:23:22,931
No,

2769
01:23:22,931 --> 01:23:23,340
no,

2770
01:23:23,340 --> 01:23:23,590
no.

2771
01:23:23,590 --> 01:23:26,890
I'm super like careful or like I'll
have somebody walk with me or something,

2772
01:23:26,950 --> 01:23:27,420
you know?

2773
01:23:27,420 --> 01:23:27,930
Right,

2774
01:23:27,930 --> 01:23:28,350
right.

2775
01:23:28,350 --> 01:23:28,830
Yeah.

2776
01:23:28,830 --> 01:23:29,663
Well,

2777
01:23:29,850 --> 01:23:31,560
it's a dark world out there sometimes.

2778
01:23:31,590 --> 01:23:33,450
Sometimes people are fucking evil is shit.

2779
01:23:33,750 --> 01:23:36,770
The fact that someone could just
hit a little tiny girl like you.

2780
01:23:36,780 --> 01:23:37,111
What do you weigh?

2781
01:23:37,111 --> 01:23:37,944
A hundred pounds.

2782
01:23:38,180 --> 01:23:39,180
100 something.

2783
01:23:39,330 --> 01:23:40,880
101 10 she's in here?

2784
01:23:41,980 --> 01:23:42,813
Yeah,

2785
01:23:43,040 --> 01:23:44,080
Raul Muscle.

2786
01:23:44,140 --> 01:23:44,920
Oh Wow.

2787
01:23:44,920 --> 01:23:45,753
Yeah.

2788
01:23:46,060 --> 01:23:48,100
It's so fun.

2789
01:23:48,170 --> 01:23:48,440
Top.

2790
01:23:48,440 --> 01:23:49,220
But someone could do that.

2791
01:23:49,220 --> 01:23:50,053
Then get hit you,

2792
01:23:50,540 --> 01:23:53,630
knock you out and just leave you on the
side of the road and that's how people

2793
01:23:53,631 --> 01:23:54,291
die like that.

2794
01:23:54,291 --> 01:23:54,860
Man.

2795
01:23:54,860 --> 01:23:56,150
People die like that all the time.

2796
01:23:56,690 --> 01:24:01,690
Kevin James was working as a bouncer and
this a nightclub in Long Island and the

2797
01:24:02,001 --> 01:24:05,840
guy who was working with kill the guy
accidentally who's a bouncer as well.

2798
01:24:05,841 --> 01:24:06,651
There's something going on.

2799
01:24:06,651 --> 01:24:07,080
Drunks,

2800
01:24:07,080 --> 01:24:07,913
craziness,

2801
01:24:08,030 --> 01:24:08,341
punch.

2802
01:24:08,341 --> 01:24:09,020
Some guy,

2803
01:24:09,020 --> 01:24:09,771
guy fell down,

2804
01:24:09,771 --> 01:24:11,810
unconscious bangs his
head off the ground dead.

2805
01:24:12,680 --> 01:24:13,513
That's what happened.

2806
01:24:13,650 --> 01:24:14,260
You never know.

2807
01:24:14,260 --> 01:24:14,621
He's like,

2808
01:24:14,621 --> 01:24:17,110
you have to hold back so many punches.

2809
01:24:17,140 --> 01:24:19,960
Like you want to punch somebody
but you never know they could die.

2810
01:24:20,200 --> 01:24:20,890
Well you seem,

2811
01:24:20,890 --> 01:24:22,750
the problem is people see movies.

2812
01:24:22,780 --> 01:24:26,020
People get like pistol whipped wack
and they fall down and you wake up.

2813
01:24:26,050 --> 01:24:26,471
Ah,

2814
01:24:26,471 --> 01:24:26,951
what happened?

2815
01:24:26,951 --> 01:24:27,330
And they,

2816
01:24:27,330 --> 01:24:28,840
they could still Duke it out and Bra.

2817
01:24:29,020 --> 01:24:31,420
Like if somebody hits you in the
back of the head with a metal hammer,

2818
01:24:31,480 --> 01:24:32,920
which is essentially what a hammer is.

2819
01:24:33,100 --> 01:24:33,510
W uh,

2820
01:24:33,510 --> 01:24:36,220
a gun is rather so he pistol whipped you,

2821
01:24:36,520 --> 01:24:37,540
you're fucked.

2822
01:24:37,680 --> 01:24:39,340
Like you're fucked for many months.

2823
01:24:39,370 --> 01:24:40,900
You might not ever be the same again.

2824
01:24:41,320 --> 01:24:42,280
My friend got hit in the head,

2825
01:24:42,310 --> 01:24:43,001
Ryan Parsons,

2826
01:24:43,001 --> 01:24:43,720
you met Ryan.

2827
01:24:43,720 --> 01:24:45,070
He got hit in the head with a golf ball.

2828
01:24:45,400 --> 01:24:47,020
He was fucked up for six months.

2829
01:24:47,170 --> 01:24:48,370
Somebody hit a line drive,

2830
01:24:48,490 --> 01:24:49,480
hit him right in the head.

2831
01:24:49,720 --> 01:24:52,090
He went down screaming in agony,

2832
01:24:52,120 --> 01:24:54,070
blacked in and out of consciousness.

2833
01:24:54,340 --> 01:24:55,570
Wasn't the same for six months,

2834
01:24:55,690 --> 01:24:56,560
couldn't go outside,

2835
01:24:56,590 --> 01:24:57,520
couldn't see the sun.

2836
01:24:57,760 --> 01:24:59,050
Sunlight would kill him.

2837
01:24:59,050 --> 01:25:00,760
It would give him piercing headaches.

2838
01:25:00,780 --> 01:25:01,120
Oh,

2839
01:25:01,120 --> 01:25:02,590
loud sounds couldn't read.

2840
01:25:03,610 --> 01:25:04,450
Fuck man.

2841
01:25:05,140 --> 01:25:05,440
Wow.

2842
01:25:05,440 --> 01:25:06,100
Yeah.

2843
01:25:06,100 --> 01:25:06,620
Shit.

2844
01:25:06,620 --> 01:25:06,940
Yeah,

2845
01:25:06,940 --> 01:25:07,773
no good.

2846
01:25:07,960 --> 01:25:10,930
We got a guy on yesterday was talking
about his friend who was in her forties.

2847
01:25:11,290 --> 01:25:11,561
Um,

2848
01:25:11,561 --> 01:25:12,394
my friend curic,

2849
01:25:12,730 --> 01:25:16,090
his friend was in her forties
and she was doing a street luge.

2850
01:25:16,300 --> 01:25:16,901
You know what it is?

2851
01:25:16,901 --> 01:25:17,590
It's kind of like,

2852
01:25:17,590 --> 01:25:17,930
you know,

2853
01:25:17,930 --> 01:25:20,980
you're like a Bob sled but on
the street and you're no like,

2854
01:25:21,430 --> 01:25:21,850
like,

2855
01:25:21,850 --> 01:25:22,091
you know,

2856
01:25:22,091 --> 01:25:23,870
you're lying down on a skateboard
or something like that.

2857
01:25:23,871 --> 01:25:24,704
And she wiped out,

2858
01:25:24,730 --> 01:25:27,250
banged her head really
hard and she was fucked.

2859
01:25:27,490 --> 01:25:30,010
Just fucked and like
pretty much permanently.

2860
01:25:30,400 --> 01:25:31,360
Permanently fucked.

2861
01:25:31,510 --> 01:25:32,320
Oh my God.

2862
01:25:32,320 --> 01:25:33,153
Yeah.

2863
01:25:34,060 --> 01:25:35,710
They told her to not read,

2864
01:25:35,711 --> 01:25:36,850
not talk to people.

2865
01:25:37,060 --> 01:25:38,310
Don't do an after six months.

2866
01:25:38,311 --> 01:25:40,000
They said you can get a pet chicken.

2867
01:25:40,510 --> 01:25:42,670
Don't get a cat or a dog
cause her to interactive

2868
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:45,740
like literally like the day,

2869
01:25:45,741 --> 01:25:47,250
like her brain's sewn.

2870
01:25:47,540 --> 01:25:48,680
Dogs are supposed to help.

2871
01:25:48,681 --> 01:25:49,100
Like,

2872
01:25:49,100 --> 01:25:49,820
you know,

2873
01:25:49,820 --> 01:25:50,750
they help some things.

2874
01:25:51,350 --> 01:25:53,060
The dog shitting all over your carpet.

2875
01:25:53,061 --> 01:25:53,630
You've got a headache.

2876
01:25:53,630 --> 01:25:54,463
You like cheese,

2877
01:25:55,090 --> 01:25:56,570
somebody's taking care of the dog.

2878
01:25:56,890 --> 01:25:57,400
Yeah.

2879
01:25:57,400 --> 01:25:59,410
You'd have to have someone
like doing everything,

2880
01:25:59,440 --> 01:26:00,580
cleaning after the dog,

2881
01:26:00,790 --> 01:26:01,550
all that jazz.

2882
01:26:01,550 --> 01:26:02,383
Wow.

2883
01:26:04,700 --> 01:26:06,750
I met a woman at one of
my shows in Brooklyn.

2884
01:26:06,780 --> 01:26:10,520
She had no hands or feet.

2885
01:26:10,730 --> 01:26:11,563
What happened to her?

2886
01:26:11,720 --> 01:26:12,140
Well,

2887
01:26:12,140 --> 01:26:16,640
she came up to me after the show and
she like wanted to like give me a hug.

2888
01:26:16,641 --> 01:26:16,911
She was like,

2889
01:26:16,911 --> 01:26:17,840
you're so funny.

2890
01:26:18,200 --> 01:26:20,030
And she had like these stubs and she said,

2891
01:26:20,060 --> 01:26:23,360
you remind me of the girls who
did my nails when I had hands.

2892
01:26:26,120 --> 01:26:26,960
And I was like,

2893
01:26:27,140 --> 01:26:27,973
whoa.

2894
01:26:28,410 --> 01:26:29,240
Then like

2895
01:26:29,240 --> 01:26:29,671
I said,

2896
01:26:29,671 --> 01:26:33,160
why so much to take table was like racism,

2897
01:26:36,260 --> 01:26:37,093
Korea,

2898
01:26:37,250 --> 01:26:38,083
Vietnamese,

2899
01:26:38,720 --> 01:26:39,640
what the fuck?

2900
01:26:39,641 --> 01:26:40,474
Oh,

2901
01:26:40,730 --> 01:26:41,563
I was like,

2902
01:26:42,110 --> 01:26:46,160
I was thinking like I want to bring
it up if I just met her any other way.

2903
01:26:46,280 --> 01:26:46,580
Right.

2904
01:26:46,580 --> 01:26:49,280
But since she brought up her hands,

2905
01:26:49,310 --> 01:26:49,761
I was like,

2906
01:26:49,761 --> 01:26:51,710
what happened to your hands?

2907
01:26:52,460 --> 01:26:54,700
And she said that she had um,

2908
01:26:54,710 --> 01:26:59,630
something wrong with her appendix went
to the hospital and the doctor put the

2909
01:26:59,631 --> 01:27:00,464
wrong name,

2910
01:27:01,180 --> 01:27:05,690
like mixed up her charts and they
amputated her hands and her feet

2911
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:11,360
when she was only supposed to get
her appendix taken out or something.

2912
01:27:11,390 --> 01:27:12,223
Very minor.

2913
01:27:15,010 --> 01:27:15,843
Yeah.

2914
01:27:16,990 --> 01:27:20,050
And then a few weeks after that
comedy show where I met her,

2915
01:27:20,260 --> 01:27:22,450
I saw on the front page
of the paper in New York,

2916
01:27:22,451 --> 01:27:23,960
it said so and so so-and-so,

2917
01:27:23,961 --> 01:27:24,761
whatever her name was,

2918
01:27:24,761 --> 01:27:25,594
I forgot her name.

2919
01:27:25,710 --> 01:27:26,260
Uh,

2920
01:27:26,260 --> 01:27:27,940
given $14 million or whatever,

2921
01:27:27,941 --> 01:27:28,211
you know,

2922
01:27:28,211 --> 01:27:30,370
like the settlement for
your hands and your feet.

2923
01:27:30,400 --> 01:27:31,570
I forget how much it was,

2924
01:27:31,571 --> 01:27:34,590
but no hand jobs maybe longer.

2925
01:27:34,840 --> 01:27:36,570
And I met her boyfriend.

2926
01:27:37,310 --> 01:27:40,920
All can imagine dating that happening
to your girlfriend and you're like,

2927
01:27:40,950 --> 01:27:41,131
ah,

2928
01:27:41,131 --> 01:27:41,341
yeah,

2929
01:27:41,341 --> 01:27:42,200
I'll stick around with it.

2930
01:27:42,220 --> 01:27:43,053
Right.

2931
01:27:45,380 --> 01:27:45,891
I asked him,

2932
01:27:45,891 --> 01:27:46,191
I said,

2933
01:27:46,191 --> 01:27:48,170
how long have you guys been together?

2934
01:27:48,410 --> 01:27:51,590
He was like a year when that happened.

2935
01:27:51,950 --> 01:27:52,640
Wow.

2936
01:27:52,640 --> 01:27:53,031
I was like,

2937
01:27:53,031 --> 01:27:53,541
well I'm man,

2938
01:27:53,541 --> 01:27:54,950
you're such a good guy.

2939
01:27:55,310 --> 01:27:55,611
You know,

2940
01:27:55,611 --> 01:27:57,500
she can't even like wipe her ass

2941
01:27:57,800 --> 01:28:00,710
or maybe he went to the fucking hospital
and switch to put things on here.

2942
01:28:00,740 --> 01:28:02,340
She is the founder.

2943
01:28:04,190 --> 01:28:05,200
All right there.

2944
01:28:06,870 --> 01:28:09,600
But you know why she was so,

2945
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:10,980
let's just so bizarre.

2946
01:28:11,010 --> 01:28:13,020
She was so happy that like,

2947
01:28:13,770 --> 01:28:14,603
you know,

2948
01:28:14,880 --> 01:28:17,990
you wonder like how that,

2949
01:28:18,270 --> 01:28:19,290
how she can be happy.

2950
01:28:19,320 --> 01:28:21,180
But she was so like,

2951
01:28:21,570 --> 01:28:22,860
she was in such a good mood.

2952
01:28:22,861 --> 01:28:24,810
Like she was just like
loving the comedy show.

2953
01:28:24,811 --> 01:28:27,630
She was so appreciative and like
she was having a great time.

2954
01:28:28,160 --> 01:28:28,710
Wow.

2955
01:28:28,710 --> 01:28:30,810
And I was like,

2956
01:28:31,290 --> 01:28:31,801
you know,

2957
01:28:31,801 --> 01:28:34,620
there's no reason that anybody
should have to commit suicide.

2958
01:28:34,621 --> 01:28:35,454
Like,

2959
01:28:35,610 --> 01:28:35,881
you know,

2960
01:28:35,881 --> 01:28:38,070
this woman doesn't even
have hands and she's happy.

2961
01:28:39,180 --> 01:28:40,860
I see your point in that regard.

2962
01:28:40,861 --> 01:28:43,530
But I think people commit
suicide because of mental issues.

2963
01:28:43,590 --> 01:28:44,850
I think that the mind,

2964
01:28:45,030 --> 01:28:46,950
the depression that people go through,

2965
01:28:46,951 --> 01:28:49,830
some people go through some
fucking unbearable depression.

2966
01:28:50,090 --> 01:28:50,730
It's just,

2967
01:28:50,730 --> 01:28:51,810
I don't understand it.

2968
01:28:51,811 --> 01:28:52,644
I don't know it.

2969
01:28:53,160 --> 01:28:57,690
But I know people have gone through it
and there's something that happens to the

2970
01:28:57,691 --> 01:29:00,870
human mind when the serotonin
dopamine levels are,

2971
01:29:01,260 --> 01:29:02,250
or you just don't

2972
01:29:02,250 --> 01:29:03,180
want to be alive.

2973
01:29:03,210 --> 01:29:04,980
You just would rather shut the lights off.

2974
01:29:05,580 --> 01:29:06,180
I get it.

2975
01:29:06,180 --> 01:29:08,610
And once you think that
you don't want to be alive,

2976
01:29:08,640 --> 01:29:12,270
that just takes over and everything's
just doomed from then on.

2977
01:29:12,300 --> 01:29:12,421
Yeah.

2978
01:29:12,421 --> 01:29:15,720
My friends going through it right now
and I was trying to talk to him the other

2979
01:29:15,720 --> 01:29:16,740
day and it's just like you can't,

2980
01:29:16,890 --> 01:29:17,940
no matter what you say,

2981
01:29:17,970 --> 01:29:22,410
it's not going to change his mind of
how horrible everything is in its place.

2982
01:29:22,490 --> 01:29:25,140
That you could just like show them
pictures of like happier times.

2983
01:29:25,141 --> 01:29:27,170
Like remember when we
went to the waterpark,

2984
01:29:27,190 --> 01:29:27,490
right.

2985
01:29:27,490 --> 01:29:30,480
And haven't worked and
have it work or you know,

2986
01:29:30,481 --> 01:29:31,830
show them memories of like,

2987
01:29:32,430 --> 01:29:34,530
you wish you could just
show them videos of,

2988
01:29:35,190 --> 01:29:35,461
you know,

2989
01:29:35,461 --> 01:29:37,080
happier times that they've had.

2990
01:29:37,200 --> 01:29:37,381
Yeah.

2991
01:29:37,381 --> 01:29:38,550
There's so many variables too.

2992
01:29:38,551 --> 01:29:39,210
There's like,

2993
01:29:39,210 --> 01:29:42,270
your life could be sucky
and there's no end in sight.

2994
01:29:42,271 --> 01:29:43,650
There's no light at the end of the tunnel.

2995
01:29:43,651 --> 01:29:48,651
Or it could be chemical and your life
is Saki or it could be a series of sad

2996
01:29:48,691 --> 01:29:53,490
things that have happened to you and
failures or losing jobs or you know,

2997
01:29:53,491 --> 01:29:55,680
being depressed and unemployable or,

2998
01:29:55,700 --> 01:29:55,890
you know,

2999
01:29:55,890 --> 01:29:57,840
there's a lot of things
that people just do,

3000
01:29:58,190 --> 01:30:01,710
a series of events take place and then
they reach a point where they feel like

3001
01:30:01,711 --> 01:30:04,100
it's never gonna get any better and
they just don't want to play anymore.

3002
01:30:04,110 --> 01:30:05,220
They just don't want to do it anymore.

3003
01:30:05,610 --> 01:30:09,030
There's a comedian who saved
a guy jumping off the bridge,

3004
01:30:09,210 --> 01:30:10,380
the George Washington bridge,

3005
01:30:10,590 --> 01:30:11,880
like a huge comedian.

3006
01:30:11,881 --> 01:30:13,050
He like held him,

3007
01:30:13,500 --> 01:30:14,161
Oh my God,

3008
01:30:14,161 --> 01:30:17,700
for like hours or something
goes really wrong.

3009
01:30:18,150 --> 01:30:18,811
I couldn't,

3010
01:30:18,811 --> 01:30:19,980
I don't think you could
hold him for hours,

3011
01:30:20,050 --> 01:30:21,540
but maybe not for hours,

3012
01:30:21,541 --> 01:30:23,850
but he was like a complete hero that day.

3013
01:30:24,860 --> 01:30:27,010
Totally got jumped the
next day was stupid.

3014
01:30:27,040 --> 01:30:28,960
I'm doing right.

3015
01:30:29,130 --> 01:30:30,210
How's your arm sore?

3016
01:30:32,480 --> 01:30:34,880
There's people that does
don't want to be here anymore.

3017
01:30:36,050 --> 01:30:37,280
They're going to die eventually.

3018
01:30:37,790 --> 01:30:38,151
You know?

3019
01:30:38,151 --> 01:30:39,260
That's what's really fucked up.

3020
01:30:39,290 --> 01:30:40,580
It's like we want them to stay alive.

3021
01:30:40,581 --> 01:30:41,361
We want to save them,

3022
01:30:41,361 --> 01:30:45,710
but we also know that this is a temporary
ride and they're hating this ride.

3023
01:30:45,740 --> 01:30:46,760
This ride sucks for them.

3024
01:30:46,790 --> 01:30:47,360
Yeah.

3025
01:30:47,360 --> 01:30:48,890
And so it's hard to tell them,

3026
01:30:48,891 --> 01:30:49,431
hey man,

3027
01:30:49,431 --> 01:30:50,720
stick around for what?

3028
01:30:51,020 --> 01:30:54,560
What am I sticking around for so they
can keep doing this for another 30 years

3029
01:30:54,710 --> 01:30:55,543
and then what?

3030
01:30:55,850 --> 01:30:56,683
And then it's over.

3031
01:30:57,460 --> 01:30:59,130
They going to talk to,

3032
01:30:59,470 --> 01:30:59,731
you know,

3033
01:30:59,731 --> 01:31:02,940
people just like people have become
hermits and they don't want to leave their

3034
01:31:02,941 --> 01:31:03,860
house and you know,

3035
01:31:04,230 --> 01:31:08,760
like our society allows it to happen
because like the way it's built nowadays

3036
01:31:08,761 --> 01:31:10,170
with so many conveniences,

3037
01:31:10,171 --> 01:31:11,820
like you could just get food delivered,

3038
01:31:11,821 --> 01:31:13,500
you can get anything
delivered to your house.

3039
01:31:13,530 --> 01:31:17,400
I had all of Guardian and you don't have
a reason to like leave your house and

3040
01:31:17,401 --> 01:31:19,320
you could just let it
pile up and become a mess.

3041
01:31:19,970 --> 01:31:20,600
Livers.

3042
01:31:20,600 --> 01:31:20,811
No,

3043
01:31:20,811 --> 01:31:22,160
but there's apps now like she said,

3044
01:31:22,161 --> 01:31:23,030
like we'll deliver anything.

3045
01:31:23,031 --> 01:31:23,330
So,

3046
01:31:23,330 --> 01:31:23,840
oh yeah,

3047
01:31:23,840 --> 01:31:24,501
go through the APP,

3048
01:31:24,501 --> 01:31:26,390
order it in like 40 minutes.

3049
01:31:26,500 --> 01:31:30,250
I had all of you could just be addicted
to internet porn and just never leave

3050
01:31:30,251 --> 01:31:30,761
your house.

3051
01:31:30,761 --> 01:31:30,830
Let's

3052
01:31:30,830 --> 01:31:31,611
do that as well.

3053
01:31:31,611 --> 01:31:32,810
There's a lot of people that do that.

3054
01:31:33,080 --> 01:31:34,710
There's a guy that I know that a,

3055
01:31:34,730 --> 01:31:37,760
he's like a professor I'm
going to get him on eventually,

3056
01:31:37,761 --> 01:31:40,670
but he thinks there's nothing
wrong with being addicted to porn.

3057
01:31:41,030 --> 01:31:44,180
He said the way he equates as being
addicted to porn is like being addicted to

3058
01:31:44,181 --> 01:31:47,840
sports or being addicted
to games or playing videos.

3059
01:31:47,900 --> 01:31:48,531
Like he's like,

3060
01:31:48,531 --> 01:31:49,180
it's just you're,

3061
01:31:49,180 --> 01:31:50,180
you're enjoying something.

3062
01:31:50,390 --> 01:31:53,900
Like everybody has this bad idea in
their head that like the obsession about

3063
01:31:53,901 --> 01:31:56,510
porn is so awful.

3064
01:31:56,750 --> 01:31:59,740
Whereas like the obsession
about video games just

3065
01:31:59,980 --> 01:32:02,560
at the most unfortunate or you know,

3066
01:32:02,561 --> 01:32:05,980
a waste of time and had sex with
a real life human being in years.

3067
01:32:06,070 --> 01:32:06,903
How do you know?

3068
01:32:07,150 --> 01:32:08,650
Maybe I think he's just a professor.

3069
01:32:08,860 --> 01:32:09,850
I'm not necessarily think,

3070
01:32:09,851 --> 01:32:11,530
I don't necessarily think
he's talking about himself.

3071
01:32:11,560 --> 01:32:12,510
I think he's trying to make

3072
01:32:12,640 --> 01:32:17,640
some sort of a rational argument for why
we have this unusual attitude about sex

3073
01:32:18,261 --> 01:32:19,670
that we don't apply to everything else.

3074
01:32:19,671 --> 01:32:19,821
Like,

3075
01:32:19,821 --> 01:32:21,620
if someone really loves cars,

3076
01:32:21,621 --> 01:32:25,490
like say if you're like a guy like loves
vintage cars and you just want like

3077
01:32:25,491 --> 01:32:25,820
there's,

3078
01:32:25,820 --> 01:32:26,361
there's people,

3079
01:32:26,361 --> 01:32:27,620
like I looked at this house,

3080
01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:28,170
uh,

3081
01:32:28,170 --> 01:32:32,810
that was for sale on there was in the
Pacific northwest and it was the guy was a

3082
01:32:32,811 --> 01:32:34,580
Ferrari fan.

3083
01:32:34,610 --> 01:32:35,990
Like you love Ferrari's,

3084
01:32:36,200 --> 01:32:37,880
so you had Ferrari design,

3085
01:32:37,881 --> 01:32:38,750
his kitchen,

3086
01:32:39,020 --> 01:32:40,580
he's like got a Ferrari kitchen.

3087
01:32:40,581 --> 01:32:45,581
And then he had a glass wall from his
living room to this enormous garage that

3088
01:32:45,891 --> 01:32:47,420
was filled with Ferrari's.

3089
01:32:47,660 --> 01:32:49,570
And this guy was just
obsessed with Ferrari.

3090
01:32:49,571 --> 01:32:49,790
He's,

3091
01:32:49,790 --> 01:32:54,170
he's just a rich guy who loved and he
had old ones and he had new ones and he

3092
01:32:54,171 --> 01:32:57,230
had like vintage ones and
this guy was just obsessed.

3093
01:32:57,380 --> 01:32:59,330
He had Ferrari books and magazines.

3094
01:32:59,900 --> 01:33:00,980
But if that was porn,

3095
01:33:00,981 --> 01:33:02,240
you'd think he's a creep.

3096
01:33:02,390 --> 01:33:02,750
Right.

3097
01:33:02,750 --> 01:33:03,230
You know,

3098
01:33:03,230 --> 01:33:03,970
if it's cars,

3099
01:33:03,970 --> 01:33:04,321
like wow,

3100
01:33:04,321 --> 01:33:05,690
he's got a fucking loves Ferraris,

3101
01:33:05,780 --> 01:33:06,680
you don't get it.

3102
01:33:06,710 --> 01:33:07,310
But he is,

3103
01:33:07,310 --> 01:33:08,210
you don't judge them.

3104
01:33:08,240 --> 01:33:08,511
You Go,

3105
01:33:08,511 --> 01:33:10,610
well I guess he just
really likes Ferrari's,

3106
01:33:10,820 --> 01:33:11,241
whatever.

3107
01:33:11,241 --> 01:33:11,781
He's got money,

3108
01:33:11,781 --> 01:33:12,530
who cares?

3109
01:33:12,530 --> 01:33:15,650
But if you went over his house and
it's all just blow up dolls and dildos

3110
01:33:15,700 --> 01:33:16,120
so far.

3111
01:33:16,120 --> 01:33:16,740
She's house.

3112
01:33:16,740 --> 01:33:17,650
Yeah,

3113
01:33:18,880 --> 01:33:20,020
it is judge his house.

3114
01:33:20,080 --> 01:33:20,381
He's like,

3115
01:33:20,381 --> 01:33:21,400
if you need a place to stay,

3116
01:33:21,401 --> 01:33:22,234
let me know.

3117
01:33:22,240 --> 01:33:22,991
Do you get pregnant?

3118
01:33:22,991 --> 01:33:24,740
Just walking through the door
and you know she's placed,

3119
01:33:25,400 --> 01:33:26,091
but you know what I'm saying?

3120
01:33:26,091 --> 01:33:26,691
It's like why?

3121
01:33:26,691 --> 01:33:27,590
Why do we get,

3122
01:33:27,800 --> 01:33:32,540
I think it's because we have weird
attitudes about sex and we also have the

3123
01:33:32,541 --> 01:33:33,950
attitude that porn,

3124
01:33:33,951 --> 01:33:37,400
at least some of it
dehumanizes women like porn.

3125
01:33:37,401 --> 01:33:40,730
At least some of it makes you look at
women like they're an object and not an

3126
01:33:40,731 --> 01:33:41,121
equal,

3127
01:33:41,121 --> 01:33:41,721
not a person.

3128
01:33:41,721 --> 01:33:42,620
Just something to fuck.

3129
01:33:43,530 --> 01:33:47,640
That's why they have a hard time meeting
a real live woman because they've been

3130
01:33:47,700 --> 01:33:48,990
desensitized to it so much.

3131
01:33:48,991 --> 01:33:50,190
They want to treat a woman like that.

3132
01:33:50,191 --> 01:33:51,150
The minute they meet her,

3133
01:33:51,540 --> 01:33:51,890
you know,

3134
01:33:51,890 --> 01:33:52,330
have time.

3135
01:33:52,330 --> 01:33:53,220
He doesn't like,

3136
01:33:53,250 --> 01:33:55,860
they don't have the
time to get to know you.

3137
01:33:55,861 --> 01:33:57,460
They don't have the patience to get to.

3138
01:33:57,470 --> 01:33:59,580
They're just like sitting there
on a date probably thinking,

3139
01:33:59,581 --> 01:34:01,890
why isn't she taking her clothes
off and licking my balls?

3140
01:34:01,920 --> 01:34:02,753
You know?

3141
01:34:02,930 --> 01:34:04,170
That's what everybody thinks by the way.

3142
01:34:06,660 --> 01:34:07,950
They just keep it to themselves.

3143
01:34:08,550 --> 01:34:09,180
Yeah,

3144
01:34:09,180 --> 01:34:09,930
definitely.

3145
01:34:09,930 --> 01:34:10,410
Well,

3146
01:34:10,410 --> 01:34:11,730
those scenarios too.

3147
01:34:11,731 --> 01:34:13,740
It's just like what we
were talking about earlier,

3148
01:34:13,800 --> 01:34:18,330
kind of any scenario that you depict in
a movie that become like the lion king

3149
01:34:18,331 --> 01:34:19,710
or Cimbar and that shit,

3150
01:34:20,010 --> 01:34:21,750
it becomes the Yogi bear.

3151
01:34:21,780 --> 01:34:23,970
It becomes like how you
start thinking of bears.

3152
01:34:24,360 --> 01:34:24,511
Well,

3153
01:34:24,511 --> 01:34:28,550
if you watched too many movies where
girls just call a plumber and starts

3154
01:34:28,551 --> 01:34:29,384
sucking his Dick,

3155
01:34:29,850 --> 01:34:34,140
you just assume that this is how
people operate and behave the same way.

3156
01:34:34,140 --> 01:34:37,860
You assume Yogi bear is going to try to
take your picnic basket and not eat your

3157
01:34:37,861 --> 01:34:38,610
kids.

3158
01:34:38,610 --> 01:34:39,240
You know,

3159
01:34:39,240 --> 01:34:43,560
we have these weird images in our
head because of the media and porn.

3160
01:34:43,860 --> 01:34:45,960
As much as it doesn't
seem like it's the media.

3161
01:34:46,170 --> 01:34:46,921
Absolutely.

3162
01:34:46,921 --> 01:34:49,260
100% is it's you're watching,

3163
01:34:49,270 --> 01:34:51,360
my college boyfriend was addicted to porn.

3164
01:34:51,510 --> 01:34:51,721
Why?

3165
01:34:51,721 --> 01:34:53,430
I think that because um,

3166
01:34:53,610 --> 01:34:57,030
I thought his name was John for the
longest time and then everybody,

3167
01:34:57,140 --> 01:34:58,190
his dorm floor was like,

3168
01:34:58,191 --> 01:34:58,401
Yo,

3169
01:34:58,401 --> 01:34:59,930
his porno John here.

3170
01:35:00,230 --> 01:35:00,741
And I was like,

3171
01:35:00,741 --> 01:35:02,240
what the fuck is Bordeaux John?

3172
01:35:02,270 --> 01:35:02,481
They're like,

3173
01:35:02,481 --> 01:35:04,050
well there's two Johns on her floor.

3174
01:35:05,570 --> 01:35:06,520
These porno John.

3175
01:35:06,560 --> 01:35:09,170
Yeah cause he like
porno cause he was like,

3176
01:35:09,440 --> 01:35:12,500
he had the most porn out
of everybody on his floor.

3177
01:35:12,590 --> 01:35:14,300
Maybe he's just really
good at collecting shit.

3178
01:35:14,930 --> 01:35:15,763
I mean,

3179
01:35:15,780 --> 01:35:16,630
I hope so.

3180
01:35:18,800 --> 01:35:20,060
I hope so now.

3181
01:35:20,061 --> 01:35:20,894
Yeah,

3182
01:35:21,870 --> 01:35:22,490
no,

3183
01:35:22,490 --> 01:35:23,540
he was like regular.

3184
01:35:23,541 --> 01:35:24,860
I was freaking than him.

3185
01:35:25,300 --> 01:35:26,500
Yeah,

3186
01:35:27,320 --> 01:35:28,250
because like,

3187
01:35:28,400 --> 01:35:28,880
I dunno,

3188
01:35:28,880 --> 01:35:33,680
I think when you're young you just like
sometimes have sex and you don't care

3189
01:35:33,681 --> 01:35:35,150
about the other people's feelings.

3190
01:35:35,460 --> 01:35:36,293
You know,

3191
01:35:41,980 --> 01:35:46,310
after he came I would keep
going and he would be like,

3192
01:35:46,400 --> 01:35:47,660
I'm trying to do my homework.

3193
01:35:47,990 --> 01:35:48,823
Do you mind?

3194
01:35:52,100 --> 01:35:53,180
You need to find a better dude.

3195
01:35:53,990 --> 01:35:55,310
That's what every guy wants.

3196
01:35:55,311 --> 01:35:56,121
Every guy wants to grow,

3197
01:35:56,121 --> 01:35:57,170
wants to have sex all the time.

3198
01:35:57,500 --> 01:35:59,180
So he wasn't that much of a freak.

3199
01:35:59,181 --> 01:36:00,860
They named him Porno John,

3200
01:36:00,861 --> 01:36:02,750
but it could be

3201
01:36:05,600 --> 01:36:07,600
eaten off like crazy white

3202
01:36:09,620 --> 01:36:10,220
woman.

3203
01:36:10,220 --> 01:36:11,060
Then once he came on,

3204
01:36:11,061 --> 01:36:12,110
so I'm done.

3205
01:36:12,111 --> 01:36:13,040
I'm fucking exhausted.

3206
01:36:13,160 --> 01:36:15,260
Cause he already ran
five marathons that day,

3207
01:36:15,660 --> 01:36:15,890
you know?

3208
01:36:15,890 --> 01:36:19,910
So running up a flight of
stairs was exhausting for a
normal person running up a

3209
01:36:19,911 --> 01:36:21,410
flight of stairs is pretty commonplace.

3210
01:36:21,460 --> 01:36:22,293
Right.

3211
01:36:22,570 --> 01:36:23,403
Porno John,

3212
01:36:23,700 --> 01:36:26,210
he just been beaten off into a couple day

3213
01:36:32,580 --> 01:36:33,413
time.

3214
01:36:34,220 --> 01:36:36,440
So why would you care if he watched porn?

3215
01:36:38,810 --> 01:36:39,810
Brainwashed by all these

3216
01:36:41,450 --> 01:36:44,780
romantic comedies or
magazines or whatever.

3217
01:36:44,840 --> 01:36:49,040
Do Romantic comedies get mad if they're
romantic comedies where a woman gets mad

3218
01:36:49,041 --> 01:36:50,300
if a guy's using porn?

3219
01:36:50,330 --> 01:36:50,900
Yeah,

3220
01:36:50,900 --> 01:36:52,900
except some of the hipper ones.

3221
01:36:55,010 --> 01:37:00,010
Like if he's watching porn that he
must not want me and I would like

3222
01:37:06,970 --> 01:37:07,860
fun to watch.

3223
01:37:09,780 --> 01:37:11,980
I don't care if he watches
girls get mad at you.

3224
01:37:12,380 --> 01:37:12,600
Yeah.

3225
01:37:12,600 --> 01:37:13,211
Like she,

3226
01:37:13,211 --> 01:37:13,770
she would get,

3227
01:37:13,770 --> 01:37:18,180
I had girls get mad at me that if I
followed porn people on Instagram,

3228
01:37:18,181 --> 01:37:19,620
Twitter to the point of like,

3229
01:37:19,621 --> 01:37:21,960
why I'm not doing it for you type thing.

3230
01:37:21,961 --> 01:37:26,961
Like it got so bad where I wasn't
allowed to do porn or even have photos of

3231
01:37:27,480 --> 01:37:30,630
women I as wallpapers
or anything like that.

3232
01:37:30,750 --> 01:37:33,590
I think when I was younger I was
taught to like think that it's,

3233
01:37:33,750 --> 01:37:34,350
you know,

3234
01:37:34,350 --> 01:37:36,630
you're just supposed to take
it personal if personally,

3235
01:37:36,631 --> 01:37:37,464
if you don't,

3236
01:37:37,500 --> 01:37:38,580
if he's watching porn,

3237
01:37:38,581 --> 01:37:38,760
he,

3238
01:37:38,760 --> 01:37:40,410
you must not be enough or something,

3239
01:37:40,500 --> 01:37:40,811
you know,

3240
01:37:40,811 --> 01:37:45,210
from your friends or was it from
probably from growing up in the Midwest.

3241
01:37:45,480 --> 01:37:46,140
That's right.

3242
01:37:46,140 --> 01:37:50,430
Chicago sort of morals like
Chicago is still the Midwest,

3243
01:37:50,431 --> 01:37:51,690
even though it's a big city,

3244
01:37:51,750 --> 01:37:52,380
it's just,

3245
01:37:52,380 --> 01:37:56,400
it's still like frowned upon

3246
01:37:56,400 --> 01:37:58,020
crazy behavior,

3247
01:37:58,120 --> 01:37:58,740
you know?

3248
01:37:58,740 --> 01:37:59,251
So I was like,

3249
01:37:59,251 --> 01:38:00,300
let me get out of here.

3250
01:38:00,390 --> 01:38:01,223
You guys suck.

3251
01:38:01,770 --> 01:38:02,790
I love Chicago.

3252
01:38:02,850 --> 01:38:03,810
But I see what you're saying.

3253
01:38:03,870 --> 01:38:05,820
I think those spots in
the middle of the country,

3254
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:06,181
you know,

3255
01:38:06,181 --> 01:38:06,930
there's a lot of,

3256
01:38:06,930 --> 01:38:10,230
there's a lot of hold overthinking
a certain of change though,

3257
01:38:10,231 --> 01:38:10,680
isn't it?

3258
01:38:10,680 --> 01:38:12,330
This is trying to change
all across the country.

3259
01:38:12,510 --> 01:38:14,160
People becoming more and more openminded.

3260
01:38:14,190 --> 01:38:15,060
Wouldn't you imagine that?

3261
01:38:15,090 --> 01:38:15,271
Well,

3262
01:38:15,271 --> 01:38:16,210
when I moved here Joe,

3263
01:38:16,620 --> 01:38:19,950
like you would talk about masturbating
all the time and I remember one time

3264
01:38:19,951 --> 01:38:21,120
you're talking about how you were math,

3265
01:38:21,150 --> 01:38:22,890
you masturbated the
other day to something.

3266
01:38:22,891 --> 01:38:23,540
And I was like,

3267
01:38:23,540 --> 01:38:25,560
I can't believe he's
telling me this right now.

3268
01:38:25,740 --> 01:38:26,640
I hope loud.

3269
01:38:26,641 --> 01:38:27,810
Like I was so like,

3270
01:38:27,840 --> 01:38:29,270
like shy about it matters.

3271
01:38:29,280 --> 01:38:30,330
Not Him like recently,

3272
01:38:30,610 --> 01:38:30,810
no,

3273
01:38:30,810 --> 01:38:32,040
this is like 13 years ago.

3274
01:38:32,850 --> 01:38:34,740
He started working for me
about 13 years ago ago.

3275
01:38:34,770 --> 01:38:35,603
Right.

3276
01:38:35,610 --> 01:38:35,851
Yeah.

3277
01:38:35,851 --> 01:38:36,684
That's cool.

3278
01:38:36,950 --> 01:38:38,550
But that's how it changed.

3279
01:38:38,580 --> 01:38:39,840
It is in the Midwest though.

3280
01:38:39,870 --> 01:38:41,850
Like talking about poop out loud.

3281
01:38:42,120 --> 01:38:42,930
No,

3282
01:38:42,930 --> 01:38:46,830
that's why Brian seems childlike because
really he's experiencing this for the

3283
01:38:46,831 --> 01:38:47,230
first time.

3284
01:38:47,230 --> 01:38:47,610
Yeah.

3285
01:38:47,610 --> 01:38:48,720
Whereas like most people,

3286
01:38:49,530 --> 01:38:50,363
by the time,

3287
01:38:51,540 --> 01:38:54,120
by the time they're 10 years
old or actually 10 yes.

3288
01:38:55,360 --> 01:38:56,820
Came here as an infant,

3289
01:38:56,821 --> 01:38:57,654
30 year old.

3290
01:38:59,190 --> 01:38:59,641
That's true.

3291
01:38:59,641 --> 01:39:00,600
But you got to agree,

3292
01:39:00,601 --> 01:39:00,901
right?

3293
01:39:00,901 --> 01:39:01,261
Like if,

3294
01:39:01,261 --> 01:39:02,220
if you know,

3295
01:39:02,221 --> 01:39:03,031
growing up in Chicago,

3296
01:39:03,031 --> 01:39:06,640
you don't want to openly talk about
masturbation and in front of people.

3297
01:39:06,641 --> 01:39:07,020
Right.

3298
01:39:07,020 --> 01:39:07,510
Right.

3299
01:39:07,510 --> 01:39:09,760
I would like xerox copy,

01:39:09,790 --> 01:39:10,630

funny and it was like,

3307
01:39:21,850 --> 01:39:22,151

3311
01:39:26,851 --> 01:39:27,850

3313
01:39:28,601 --> 01:39:33,250
hastily made drawings that just have
like one word or one phrase or something.

3314
01:39:33,270 --> 01:39:33,520
Right.

3315
01:39:33,520 --> 01:39:34,200
With like,

3316
01:39:34,200 --> 01:39:34,420

3317
01:39:34,420 --> 01:39:36,230
somebody holding a [inaudible],

3318
01:39:36,280 --> 01:39:36,820
you know?

3319
01:39:36,820 --> 01:39:40,420
And I would just like think those were
funny and I would spread rumors in my

3320
01:39:40,421 --> 01:39:42,580
school about like sex ed,

3321
01:39:42,581 --> 01:39:43,414
cause that was always like,

3322
01:39:43,420 --> 01:39:44,010
Ooh,

3323
01:39:44,010 --> 01:39:45,030
having sex ed,

3324
01:39:45,100 --> 01:39:45,361
you know,

3325
01:39:45,361 --> 01:39:47,700
we're in sixth grade and so I'd be like,

3326
01:39:48,150 --> 01:39:48,451
you know,

3327
01:39:48,451 --> 01:39:51,420
so our class went first insect set,

3328
01:39:51,450 --> 01:39:51,930
so the,

3329
01:39:51,930 --> 01:39:53,010
the afternoon class was like,

3330
01:39:53,040 --> 01:39:54,180
oh what was it like?

3331
01:39:54,480 --> 01:39:54,901
And I was like,

3332
01:39:54,901 --> 01:39:59,340
well Mrs Elmore and Mr.
Reynolds got naked and had sex.

3333
01:39:59,760 --> 01:40:00,593
They were like,

3334
01:40:02,470 --> 01:40:04,240
I would like start rumors like that,

3335
01:40:04,241 --> 01:40:04,391
you know,

3336
01:40:04,391 --> 01:40:05,650
when people believed me.

3337
01:40:05,710 --> 01:40:06,910
Is that how you became a comic?

3338
01:40:07,180 --> 01:40:07,780
Yeah.

3339
01:40:07,780 --> 01:40:09,490
By just being inappropriate,

3340
01:40:09,760 --> 01:40:11,080
but being funny in school,

3341
01:40:11,140 --> 01:40:14,050
being fine in school and then
like people didn't expect it.

3342
01:40:14,051 --> 01:40:14,320
You're,

3343
01:40:14,320 --> 01:40:15,310
you're this small,

3344
01:40:15,311 --> 01:40:16,470
cute girl and you're saying,

3345
01:40:16,471 --> 01:40:16,560
yeah,

3346
01:40:16,560 --> 01:40:17,400
these dirty things.

3347
01:40:17,420 --> 01:40:17,670
Well,

3348
01:40:17,670 --> 01:40:18,710
and the teacher like,

3349
01:40:18,840 --> 01:40:22,410
so I would never get in trouble either
because I would always just find

3350
01:40:22,411 --> 01:40:22,920
somebody,

3351
01:40:22,920 --> 01:40:25,290
somebody who looked like
red van and blame it on him,

3352
01:40:25,380 --> 01:40:26,040
you know,

3353
01:40:26,040 --> 01:40:27,090
good move and be like,

3354
01:40:27,120 --> 01:40:28,290
I didn't want to do that.

3355
01:40:29,040 --> 01:40:30,810
That's a good move and
changed the whole schedule.

3356
01:40:32,070 --> 01:40:32,850
Yeah.

3357
01:40:32,850 --> 01:40:33,683
Your bully.

3358
01:40:34,660 --> 01:40:35,493
It's funny though.

3359
01:40:35,550 --> 01:40:36,450
I am a bully.

3360
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:37,690
How you get in fights a lot though?

3361
01:40:37,691 --> 01:40:38,524
I don't you,

3362
01:40:39,180 --> 01:40:40,013
um,

3363
01:40:40,020 --> 01:40:40,890
physical fights.

3364
01:40:41,480 --> 01:40:42,930
I mean maybe not physical.

3365
01:40:43,200 --> 01:40:44,040
You get in fights.

3366
01:40:44,340 --> 01:40:44,581
No,

3367
01:40:44,581 --> 01:40:45,414
I don't get in fights.

3368
01:40:45,450 --> 01:40:45,810
No.

3369
01:40:45,810 --> 01:40:46,441
What are you talking about?

3370
01:40:46,441 --> 01:40:47,161
Where are you making this up?

3371
01:40:47,161 --> 01:40:48,900
Fairly or she said something about,

3372
01:40:48,920 --> 01:40:49,390
uh,

3373
01:40:49,390 --> 01:40:49,800
uh,

3374
01:40:49,800 --> 01:40:50,580
punching.

3375
01:40:50,580 --> 01:40:50,800
Uh,

3376
01:40:50,800 --> 01:40:51,571
you said something about it,

3377
01:40:51,571 --> 01:40:53,090
you never know when to stop punching.

3378
01:40:53,530 --> 01:40:53,980
And I thought

3379
01:40:53,980 --> 01:40:55,120
you were talking personally.

3380
01:40:55,121 --> 01:40:56,800
I think I'm just going to
ask you if you had kids,

3381
01:40:57,050 --> 01:41:00,290
do you as an anybody
out there listening you,

3382
01:41:01,340 --> 01:41:02,420
he thought I met me.

3383
01:41:02,570 --> 01:41:03,380
Oh,

3384
01:41:03,380 --> 01:41:05,810
you never know when to stop punching.

3385
01:41:05,820 --> 01:41:10,820
What you want to be careful who you
punch [inaudible] because you know they

3386
01:41:10,851 --> 01:41:14,250
might crack their head open and die soon.

3387
01:41:14,390 --> 01:41:16,080
That she got a lot of
fights because of that.

3388
01:41:16,450 --> 01:41:16,901
Well No,

3389
01:41:16,901 --> 01:41:17,261
cause she,

3390
01:41:17,261 --> 01:41:18,370
she said something like,

3391
01:41:18,390 --> 01:41:18,560
uh,

3392
01:41:18,560 --> 01:41:19,061
you,

3393
01:41:19,061 --> 01:41:19,440
you,

3394
01:41:19,440 --> 01:41:19,640
you,

3395
01:41:19,640 --> 01:41:22,480
you never know when to stop pumps
punching it and how she said it,

3396
01:41:22,481 --> 01:41:24,190
she says like you like as in like,

3397
01:41:24,340 --> 01:41:24,641
you know,

3398
01:41:24,641 --> 01:41:26,020
you never know when to stop punching.

3399
01:41:26,890 --> 01:41:27,700
I was thinking like,

3400
01:41:27,700 --> 01:41:28,533
Oh

3401
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:29,690
do you follow,

3402
01:41:29,690 --> 01:41:31,190
are you falling when he's saying no?

3403
01:41:31,520 --> 01:41:34,030
Why does he think that you get in fights
to get in arguments with people or

3404
01:41:34,040 --> 01:41:34,550
something?

3405
01:41:34,550 --> 01:41:35,930
I understand why he would think that.

3406
01:41:36,080 --> 01:41:36,531
Why do you,

3407
01:41:36,531 --> 01:41:37,364
are you feisty?

3408
01:41:37,370 --> 01:41:38,203
Is that what this is?

3409
01:41:39,080 --> 01:41:40,310
I mean I have been,

3410
01:41:40,311 --> 01:41:42,590
but I'm not like that's
not my normal state.

3411
01:41:43,670 --> 01:41:44,503
You know,

3412
01:41:44,720 --> 01:41:45,610
she doesn't seem like someone gets it.

3413
01:41:45,810 --> 01:41:46,081
No,

3414
01:41:46,081 --> 01:41:47,310
it was just how she said it earlier.

3415
01:41:47,960 --> 01:41:51,150
It's always just trying to sound like
I know how to finance it cause you guys

3416
01:41:51,151 --> 01:41:51,984
talk about MMA

3417
01:41:52,250 --> 01:41:52,830
so,

3418
01:41:52,830 --> 01:41:53,580
oh yeah,

3419
01:41:53,580 --> 01:41:54,330
that's what we do.

3420
01:41:54,330 --> 01:41:57,300
So did you fly down here just
to hang out and do some shows?

3421
01:41:57,990 --> 01:42:00,210
How many days you down
here for till Saturday?

3422
01:42:00,480 --> 01:42:03,150
Thinking about moving to
California St Fuck Miami.

3423
01:42:03,180 --> 01:42:04,080
I think you are right.

3424
01:42:04,081 --> 01:42:04,950
I love it here.

3425
01:42:05,600 --> 01:42:06,433
Right?

3426
01:42:06,670 --> 01:42:08,350
Most comedy community do.

3427
01:42:08,351 --> 01:42:12,000
She'd come last night at the comedy store
was off the fucking Hook last night.

3428
01:42:13,040 --> 01:42:13,260
Oh,

3429
01:42:13,260 --> 01:42:14,860
the bros powder and the original round,

3430
01:42:14,880 --> 01:42:16,140
the original room was sold out.

3431
01:42:16,141 --> 01:42:16,951
It was mobbed.

3432
01:42:16,951 --> 01:42:17,850
It was amazing.

3433
01:42:18,180 --> 01:42:19,140
And then upstairs,

3434
01:42:19,141 --> 01:42:23,070
a roast battle was crazy
packed and a fucking hilarious.

3435
01:42:23,130 --> 01:42:24,750
Who was the kid that went on first?

3436
01:42:24,751 --> 01:42:25,030
The Guy,

3437
01:42:25,030 --> 01:42:26,940
the guy who won the roast battle,

3438
01:42:26,970 --> 01:42:28,710
the blonde guy with the glasses.

3439
01:42:29,550 --> 01:42:30,301
Find Jamie.

3440
01:42:30,301 --> 01:42:30,840
Find that dude,

3441
01:42:30,840 --> 01:42:32,610
that guy was fucking money.

3442
01:42:32,670 --> 01:42:33,503
It's too,

3443
01:42:33,730 --> 01:42:34,370
too crowded.

3444
01:42:34,370 --> 01:42:35,590
Even go in there and watch it.

3445
01:42:35,591 --> 01:42:37,520
So like I didn't get to see any of the,

3446
01:42:37,521 --> 01:42:38,354
uh,

3447
01:42:38,690 --> 01:42:39,590

3448
01:42:39,591 --> 01:42:40,311
who's going to battle?

3449
01:42:40,311 --> 01:42:40,940
Who?

3450
01:42:40,940 --> 01:42:41,751
That's a good question.

3451
01:42:41,751 --> 01:42:42,620
I don't know the answer to that.

3452
01:42:42,621 --> 01:42:45,850
But Brian Moses is the host and it's a,

3453
01:42:45,860 --> 01:42:48,440
it's a perfect length show
cause it happens late at night.

3454
01:42:48,490 --> 01:42:48,670
Have,

3455
01:42:48,670 --> 01:42:51,650
it's like 1145 and it
only lasts like an hour.

3456
01:42:51,740 --> 01:42:52,220
It's like,

3457
01:42:52,220 --> 01:42:52,430
it's,

3458
01:42:52,430 --> 01:42:53,180
and it's over,

3459
01:42:53,180 --> 01:42:53,391
you know,

3460
01:42:53,391 --> 01:42:54,350
but one o'clock in the morning,

3461
01:42:54,351 --> 01:42:55,190
everybody's going home.

3462
01:42:55,280 --> 01:42:55,920
It's perfect.

3463
01:42:55,920 --> 01:42:56,600
It's perfect.

3464
01:42:56,600 --> 01:42:58,650
It's monstrously fun.

3465
01:42:59,550 --> 01:43:00,300
Jeff.

3466
01:43:00,300 --> 01:43:01,133
Yeah.

3467
01:43:01,370 --> 01:43:02,203
Jeff sewing.

3468
01:43:02,370 --> 01:43:02,650
God.

3469
01:43:02,650 --> 01:43:02,871
Damn,

3470
01:43:02,871 --> 01:43:03,704
that dude's funny.

3471
01:43:04,870 --> 01:43:06,140
He killed dude.

3472
01:43:06,170 --> 01:43:07,490
He's really fucking good.

3473
01:43:07,880 --> 01:43:08,930
He's a funny guy,

3474
01:43:08,931 --> 01:43:09,680
man.

3475
01:43:09,680 --> 01:43:10,880
I don't know how long
that guy has been doing.

3476
01:43:10,881 --> 01:43:11,630
Stand up.

3477
01:43:11,630 --> 01:43:12,800
I think they said four years.

3478
01:43:13,550 --> 01:43:14,390
Keep an eye on him.

3479
01:43:14,960 --> 01:43:15,740
Jeff sewing,

3480
01:43:15,740 --> 01:43:16,490
s.

3481
01:43:16,490 --> 01:43:18,230
E.

3482
01:43:18,230 --> 01:43:18,230
W.

3483
01:43:18,230 --> 01:43:18,230
I.

3484
01:43:18,230 --> 01:43:18,230
N.

3485
01:43:18,230 --> 01:43:18,500
G.

3486
01:43:18,500 --> 01:43:23,500
And one of the things I love about that
place is it's open like a to like young

3487
01:43:23,750 --> 01:43:24,890
up and coming comics.

3488
01:43:24,891 --> 01:43:26,120
They can make a name for themselves.

3489
01:43:26,121 --> 01:43:26,931
They're like,

3490
01:43:26,931 --> 01:43:27,261
people,

3491
01:43:27,261 --> 01:43:29,420
like there's some people
that on the show last night,

3492
01:43:30,010 --> 01:43:30,440
um,

3493
01:43:30,440 --> 01:43:31,273
that weren't that good.

3494
01:43:31,310 --> 01:43:31,760
And there's,

3495
01:43:31,760 --> 01:43:33,770
there's a couple that
were like kind of shaky,

3496
01:43:34,100 --> 01:43:35,900
but the fact that they get a chance,

3497
01:43:35,930 --> 01:43:36,680
like if you're,

3498
01:43:36,680 --> 01:43:37,131
if you're,

3499
01:43:37,131 --> 01:43:38,600
you don't have to have a bunch of,

3500
01:43:39,490 --> 01:43:39,800
you know,

3501
01:43:39,800 --> 01:43:41,750
resume items that you can call upon.

3502
01:43:41,751 --> 01:43:43,040
You don't have to have like a bunch of,

3503
01:43:43,041 --> 01:43:43,310
uh,

3504
01:43:43,310 --> 01:43:44,360
credits to your name.

3505
01:43:44,540 --> 01:43:48,320
You could just be a local comic
who is down on their luck.

3506
01:43:48,560 --> 01:43:50,210
You go up there and you
can crush like this guy,

3507
01:43:50,211 --> 01:43:52,310
this Jeff Guy and just smash

3508
01:43:52,310 --> 01:43:54,740
it and then we'll be talking about
you the next day and everybody will be

3509
01:43:54,741 --> 01:43:55,191
talking about,

3510
01:43:55,191 --> 01:43:55,340
yeah,

3511
01:43:55,340 --> 01:43:59,870
it's just an amazing showcase and
it's alive fucking experience.

3512
01:44:00,230 --> 01:44:02,510
Like roast battle is one of the cool,

3513
01:44:02,540 --> 01:44:05,480
like it was never there when I was there
in the old days of the comedy store.

3514
01:44:05,481 --> 01:44:06,314
This new Vr,

3515
01:44:06,320 --> 01:44:08,010
it's one of the pieces of um,

3516
01:44:08,570 --> 01:44:12,230
the new comedy store that like that I
point to when I talk about how much better

3517
01:44:12,231 --> 01:44:13,064
it is there now,

3518
01:44:13,160 --> 01:44:14,660
it's just a better environment.

3519
01:44:14,661 --> 01:44:17,060
Everything's better that a young
up and coming guys are better.

3520
01:44:17,061 --> 01:44:18,200
The young girls,

3521
01:44:18,410 --> 01:44:19,400
they're all better.

3522
01:44:19,401 --> 01:44:20,660
There's just more energy,

3523
01:44:20,661 --> 01:44:21,494
more life.

3524
01:44:21,620 --> 01:44:24,080
And then this shit like killed
Tony and the roast battle.

3525
01:44:24,081 --> 01:44:26,600
Those two things are just
giant for that place.

3526
01:44:26,960 --> 01:44:27,680
Giant.

3527
01:44:27,680 --> 01:44:29,330
It's great for new comics.

3528
01:44:29,360 --> 01:44:30,930
It's one of the best things ever.

3529
01:44:30,931 --> 01:44:34,670
Have both of those shows or shows
to kill Tony's giant for new comics.

3530
01:44:34,700 --> 01:44:35,270
Giant.

3531
01:44:35,270 --> 01:44:35,601
And there's,

3532
01:44:35,601 --> 01:44:35,841
yeah,

3533
01:44:35,841 --> 01:44:37,790
and there's so many
comics that are like a,

3534
01:44:37,791 --> 01:44:38,624
you know,

3535
01:44:38,870 --> 01:44:40,160
that are on kill Tony.

3536
01:44:40,161 --> 01:44:44,420
They have almost become regulars that
are already surpassing people that have

3537
01:44:44,421 --> 01:44:48,210
been doing it for 10 years in me and
Cami just because of the Internet and,

3538
01:44:48,230 --> 01:44:51,650
and the idea of it being
broadcast and podcasts and stuff.

3539
01:44:51,651 --> 01:44:52,700
It's great for them.

3540
01:44:52,850 --> 01:44:56,390
It forces you to like
hit another level early.

3541
01:44:56,510 --> 01:44:57,170
You know,

3542
01:44:57,170 --> 01:45:00,170
especially like girls like Kim
and Sarah because they're doing,

3543
01:45:00,200 --> 01:45:04,490
if you never watched or listened to
kill Tony on the death squad podcast

3544
01:45:04,491 --> 01:45:05,300
network,

3545
01:45:05,300 --> 01:45:05,960
it um,

3546
01:45:05,960 --> 01:45:09,860
killed Tony is a podcast where
they have new comics go up.

3547
01:45:09,861 --> 01:45:10,910
They do one minute of you.

3548
01:45:10,920 --> 01:45:11,361
You've seen it,

3549
01:45:11,361 --> 01:45:11,620
right?

3550
01:45:11,620 --> 01:45:11,780
Yeah,

3551
01:45:11,780 --> 01:45:12,350
that's true.

3552
01:45:12,350 --> 01:45:13,190
Have you ever been on it?

3553
01:45:13,240 --> 01:45:13,581
No,

3554
01:45:13,581 --> 01:45:16,550
I'd never been on it should be on
it as a host or as a judge rather.

3555
01:45:16,550 --> 01:45:17,240
It's awesome.

3556
01:45:17,240 --> 01:45:18,840
So fun seeing it happen.

3557
01:45:18,841 --> 01:45:19,320
Yeah.

3558
01:45:19,320 --> 01:45:20,210
And not really a judge.

3559
01:45:20,211 --> 01:45:23,840
They're like a comedy
expert comic working comic.

3560
01:45:24,110 --> 01:45:24,943
So they do a minute,

3561
01:45:24,950 --> 01:45:28,790
everybody knows one minute and then
the comics talk about your minute and

3562
01:45:28,791 --> 01:45:29,571
sometimes they go,

3563
01:45:29,571 --> 01:45:29,871
dude,

3564
01:45:29,871 --> 01:45:30,710
you're fucking awesome.

3565
01:45:30,711 --> 01:45:31,910
You got a real future.

3566
01:45:31,911 --> 01:45:32,631
And sometimes they go,

3567
01:45:32,631 --> 01:45:33,464
just stop.

3568
01:45:33,770 --> 01:45:36,450
Don't do this anymore for a day job.

3569
01:45:36,460 --> 01:45:37,580
Keep it actor.

3570
01:45:37,610 --> 01:45:40,280
But Kim and Sarah do a new minute.

3571
01:45:40,310 --> 01:45:41,090
Yeah.

3572
01:45:41,090 --> 01:45:41,811
Kim Cognitive.

3573
01:45:41,811 --> 01:45:44,960
Sarah wan Shank to a
new minute every week.

3574
01:45:45,680 --> 01:45:46,513
Wow.

3575
01:45:46,520 --> 01:45:47,353
Gangster.

3576
01:45:47,600 --> 01:45:49,850
So ballsy to be able to do that.

3577
01:45:49,851 --> 01:45:51,860
To be able to come up with a new
mat and to put it on the Internet.

3578
01:45:51,980 --> 01:45:54,440
So they're all of their
comedy career like for,

3579
01:45:54,441 --> 01:45:57,110
especially Kim from the beginning to like,

3580
01:45:57,111 --> 01:46:00,560
Sarah did it a little while
before she did ballsy.

3581
01:46:00,620 --> 01:46:02,660
Haulover sets all of our sets,

3582
01:46:03,160 --> 01:46:05,600
every brand new minute every week and it,

3583
01:46:05,601 --> 01:46:07,160
because of that it forces her and she,

3584
01:46:07,280 --> 01:46:08,870
she won last night in the roast battle.

3585
01:46:09,050 --> 01:46:11,150
Very close fucking battle.

3586
01:46:11,151 --> 01:46:12,860
Like he could have gone either way easily.

3587
01:46:12,940 --> 01:46:13,890
It was amazing.

3588
01:46:14,540 --> 01:46:15,171
She ended it.

3589
01:46:15,171 --> 01:46:15,680
Well,

3590
01:46:15,680 --> 01:46:16,730
she ended up with a bomb.

3591
01:46:16,760 --> 01:46:17,180
Yeah,

3592
01:46:17,180 --> 01:46:17,601
she did it.

3593
01:46:17,601 --> 01:46:18,351
She knows how to do it.

3594
01:46:18,351 --> 01:46:18,951
I mean she's,

3595
01:46:18,951 --> 01:46:21,200
this is her fifth win at roast battle.

3596
01:46:21,201 --> 01:46:22,120
She knows how to handle it.

3597
01:46:22,140 --> 01:46:22,973
She's a fighter.

3598
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:24,110
That Dude Jeff though,

3599
01:46:24,290 --> 01:46:26,960
he was fucking vicious.

3600
01:46:27,440 --> 01:46:27,890
Oh.

3601
01:46:27,890 --> 01:46:31,070
Like I felt bad laughing at some
of the shit that he was saying,

3602
01:46:31,071 --> 01:46:32,530
but it was poor girl.

3603
01:46:33,200 --> 01:46:34,040
It was ruthless.

3604
01:46:34,041 --> 01:46:34,940
So she tried,

3605
01:46:35,030 --> 01:46:35,631
she tried,

3606
01:46:35,631 --> 01:46:37,820
she went after him and she got
him with some good ones too,

3607
01:46:38,210 --> 01:46:39,920
but he had some nuclear weapons.

3608
01:46:39,921 --> 01:46:40,641
It was fucked up.

3609
01:46:40,641 --> 01:46:44,840
It was like she pulled out some big
cannons and fucked him up and then he just

3610
01:46:44,841 --> 01:46:49,110
dropped nuclear bombs and leveled the
landscape to the point where people were

3611
01:46:49,111 --> 01:46:50,700
falling out of chairs.

3612
01:46:50,880 --> 01:46:54,750
I was curled up in the fetal position on
the two chairs and then the Negro wave

3613
01:46:54,900 --> 01:46:55,061
the,

3614
01:46:55,061 --> 01:46:56,100
they have these guys,

3615
01:46:56,130 --> 01:46:58,540
if you never watched a roast
battle before these got,

3616
01:46:58,560 --> 01:46:59,970
and you can watch it on periscope too.

3617
01:46:59,970 --> 01:47:01,080
You don't have to be in la.

3618
01:47:01,260 --> 01:47:03,810
But if you are in la on a Tuesday night,

3619
01:47:04,110 --> 01:47:06,810
get to the Goddamn comedy store and
you got to get tickets early cause it's

3620
01:47:06,811 --> 01:47:07,650
always sold out.

3621
01:47:08,010 --> 01:47:08,843
But they have this,

3622
01:47:08,910 --> 01:47:10,680
whenever someone kills with a joke,

3623
01:47:10,681 --> 01:47:12,970
the Negro wave jumps up and they scream.

3624
01:47:12,971 --> 01:47:14,660
And that was a Jamal who the dude,

3625
01:47:14,661 --> 01:47:15,570
he poured water on himself.

3626
01:47:15,600 --> 01:47:17,370
Shamar Jomar Oh my God,

3627
01:47:17,371 --> 01:47:18,180
this kid's funny.

3628
01:47:18,180 --> 01:47:20,970
He's a real yoked black
dude with a shaved head.

3629
01:47:21,310 --> 01:47:24,380
He pulls his pants down to like the
middle of his Dick and he poured,

3630
01:47:24,390 --> 01:47:26,160
they pour water on him and he's dancing.

3631
01:47:26,161 --> 01:47:30,030
He climbs up on chairs and he's grinding
in people's faces and it's all just

3632
01:47:30,031 --> 01:47:31,260
because this joke was,

3633
01:47:31,290 --> 01:47:35,130
it killed so hard that they act up
and get crazy and it makes it 10 times

3634
01:47:35,131 --> 01:47:35,520
funnier.

3635
01:47:35,520 --> 01:47:36,060
Yeah.

3636
01:47:36,060 --> 01:47:37,740
It's such a good show.

3637
01:47:37,890 --> 01:47:40,770
Like every time I walk out of there I
have this giant smile on my face and I

3638
01:47:40,771 --> 01:47:42,660
feel like I've seen something cool.

3639
01:47:43,330 --> 01:47:45,960
I feel like I've been a part
of something like this is like,

3640
01:47:46,040 --> 01:47:46,680
I don't know,

3641
01:47:46,680 --> 01:47:47,880
there's no place like this.

3642
01:47:47,930 --> 01:47:48,571
I don't know any,

3643
01:47:48,571 --> 01:47:48,681
yeah,

3644
01:47:48,681 --> 01:47:50,650
I saw they did one in
Montreal this week too.

3645
01:47:50,710 --> 01:47:51,110
Yeah,

3646
01:47:51,110 --> 01:47:51,291
yeah.

3647
01:47:51,291 --> 01:47:52,520
They're doing another Montreal too.

3648
01:47:52,940 --> 01:47:53,091
Yeah,

3649
01:47:53,091 --> 01:47:54,140
they did it at the festival.

3650
01:47:54,290 --> 01:47:55,160
So it's fucking great.

3651
01:47:55,161 --> 01:47:57,080
And you're doing a
podcast with Brian Moses,

3652
01:47:57,081 --> 01:47:57,261
right?

3653
01:47:57,261 --> 01:48:01,130
It was as close to way we actually
have the podcast version of,

3654
01:48:01,150 --> 01:48:01,480
uh,

3655
01:48:01,480 --> 01:48:06,380
the roast battle on desk squat now called
verbal violence with coach t and Brian

3656
01:48:06,380 --> 01:48:06,381
Moses.

3657
01:48:06,381 --> 01:48:09,110
And it's the second episode was
released in a third episode.

3658
01:48:09,111 --> 01:48:10,010
Should be anytime now.

3659
01:48:10,070 --> 01:48:10,521
Beautiful.

3660
01:48:10,521 --> 01:48:11,960
And Brian Moses water.

3661
01:48:11,961 --> 01:48:12,740
Good Dude.

3662
01:48:12,740 --> 01:48:13,700
We got to have him in.

3663
01:48:13,760 --> 01:48:14,030
Yeah.

3664
01:48:14,030 --> 01:48:15,210
He's such a dude.

3665
01:48:15,230 --> 01:48:18,350
Such a funny dude and just a good comic.

3666
01:48:18,351 --> 01:48:19,110
He's going to be great.

3667
01:48:19,110 --> 01:48:23,130
That kid is going to be giant
verbal violence available violence.

3668
01:48:23,530 --> 01:48:24,200
Um,

3669
01:48:24,200 --> 01:48:25,011
so what else is going on?

3670
01:48:25,011 --> 01:48:25,310
Esther?

3671
01:48:25,310 --> 01:48:26,330
Why don't you have a podcast?

3672
01:48:26,331 --> 01:48:27,164
Do you have a podcast?

3673
01:48:27,650 --> 01:48:28,160
Well,

3674
01:48:28,160 --> 01:48:30,710
I do want to start a podcast
and should I actually,

3675
01:48:30,711 --> 01:48:31,544
this one today,

3676
01:48:32,020 --> 01:48:33,950
I did record three episodes.

3677
01:48:34,100 --> 01:48:34,890
What happened to them?

3678
01:48:34,890 --> 01:48:35,210
Um,

3679
01:48:35,210 --> 01:48:37,900
I'm just waiting to get
more before I released them.

3680
01:48:37,901 --> 01:48:38,734
What would you do that,

3681
01:48:39,140 --> 01:48:43,810
because like in case I don't find
more people or you know what I mean?

3682
01:48:43,830 --> 01:48:44,481
Can you say run out?

3683
01:48:44,481 --> 01:48:46,250
What if I like air three episodes,

3684
01:48:46,251 --> 01:48:47,840
one each week or once every Monday,

3685
01:48:48,080 --> 01:48:49,250
and then the fourth week I just,

3686
01:48:49,910 --> 01:48:51,120
I don't have to do a solo on.

3687
01:48:51,160 --> 01:48:51,860
That's okay.

3688
01:48:51,860 --> 01:48:53,960
And moved to California and
see the beautiful thing.

3689
01:48:53,961 --> 01:48:54,141
Yeah.

3690
01:48:54,141 --> 01:48:55,280
You can move to California and Brian,

3691
01:48:55,281 --> 01:48:58,010
I'll just sexually harass you every week,

3692
01:48:58,550 --> 01:49:00,920
but you can do one whenever you want.

3693
01:49:00,950 --> 01:49:02,750
That's the beautiful
thing about the Internet,

3694
01:49:02,751 --> 01:49:02,960
right?

3695
01:49:02,960 --> 01:49:04,280
You don't have to be regular,

3696
01:49:04,310 --> 01:49:04,730
right?

3697
01:49:04,730 --> 01:49:05,460
No,

3698
01:49:05,460 --> 01:49:06,293
no.

3699
01:49:06,730 --> 01:49:08,720
You have a bunch of of Twitter followers,

3700
01:49:08,840 --> 01:49:12,380
Facebook friends and all that jazz and
wanting to start a podcast and I have a

3701
01:49:12,381 --> 01:49:13,370
name for it.

3702
01:49:13,640 --> 01:49:14,473
What's it called?

3703
01:49:14,830 --> 01:49:15,890
Cuckoo for cocoa puffs?

3704
01:49:15,910 --> 01:49:16,281
No,

3705
01:49:16,281 --> 01:49:20,810
it's called the Poo podcast because
I like talking about my poop.

3706
01:49:21,760 --> 01:49:22,470
All right,

3707
01:49:22,470 --> 01:49:23,303
and you and Brian,

3708
01:49:25,260 --> 01:49:26,180
we should get married.

3709
01:49:26,660 --> 01:49:28,020
Well that's not gonna work out,

3710
01:49:28,120 --> 01:49:29,380
but maybe she just be friends.

3711
01:49:29,381 --> 01:49:29,981
Can put babies,

3712
01:49:29,981 --> 01:49:30,461
I think almost.

3713
01:49:30,461 --> 01:49:30,631
No.

3714
01:49:30,631 --> 01:49:31,271
What does she get married?

3715
01:49:31,271 --> 01:49:32,104
How about that?

3716
01:49:32,990 --> 01:49:33,630
Yeah.

3717
01:49:33,630 --> 01:49:33,950
Yeah.

3718
01:49:33,950 --> 01:49:35,380
Just nothing wrong with being together.

3719
01:49:35,381 --> 01:49:39,340
But here's the thing about the marriage
that's really goofy is the legal

3720
01:49:39,341 --> 01:49:43,450
contract aspect of it to bring in other
people and signing paperwork and stuff.

3721
01:49:43,950 --> 01:49:44,350
Just like,

3722
01:49:44,350 --> 01:49:46,810
but how can you like stamp that on,

3723
01:49:47,230 --> 01:49:47,711
you know,

3724
01:49:47,711 --> 01:49:47,980
it's

3725
01:49:47,980 --> 01:49:48,221
just,

3726
01:49:48,221 --> 01:49:51,550
so the only way it makes sense
to me is when you have children,

3727
01:49:51,670 --> 01:49:54,610
you have children and the wife doesn't
want to get stuck with no money.

3728
01:49:54,640 --> 01:49:55,960
I have a friend who's married,

3729
01:49:56,080 --> 01:49:58,000
who's not married and is pregnant,

3730
01:49:58,090 --> 01:50:02,380
and I know that baby is going to grow
up in a loving home with two parents.

3731
01:50:02,410 --> 01:50:03,160
You know,

3732
01:50:03,160 --> 01:50:05,770
like you don't have to get married
to have kids in that scenario.

3733
01:50:05,771 --> 01:50:06,670
I hope you correct,

3734
01:50:07,020 --> 01:50:10,060
but I think for a lot of women
they want like legal protection.

3735
01:50:10,061 --> 01:50:13,110
They want to be able to like be
able to get money out support,

3736
01:50:13,570 --> 01:50:14,530
not just child support,

3737
01:50:14,531 --> 01:50:15,311
but even alimony,

3738
01:50:15,311 --> 01:50:16,690
be able to pay for themselves too.

3739
01:50:17,110 --> 01:50:18,290
If they've been living their life,

3740
01:50:18,580 --> 01:50:22,840
being taken care of the child and made
some sort of a mutual Deon and the dude

3741
01:50:22,841 --> 01:50:24,100
just decides a fucking jet.

3742
01:50:24,280 --> 01:50:24,910
Listen Bitch,

3743
01:50:24,910 --> 01:50:25,743
I moved to Jamaica,

3744
01:50:26,650 --> 01:50:27,640
wanted to get married.

3745
01:50:28,270 --> 01:50:30,760
It just seems like you're just tied down.

3746
01:50:31,060 --> 01:50:33,040
Well that's why they made divorce.

3747
01:50:34,060 --> 01:50:35,080
But you aren't tied down.

3748
01:50:35,081 --> 01:50:36,550
I mean that's exactly what it is.

3749
01:50:36,551 --> 01:50:37,690
It's a legal contract.

3750
01:50:37,691 --> 01:50:38,200
It's crazy.

3751
01:50:38,200 --> 01:50:39,130
The only thing that makes sense,

3752
01:50:39,131 --> 01:50:39,491
like I said,

3753
01:50:39,491 --> 01:50:41,110
the only time it makes
sense if you have children,

3754
01:50:41,230 --> 01:50:42,390
this is coming from someone's happy.

3755
01:50:42,400 --> 01:50:43,680
He marries a green card.

3756
01:50:44,200 --> 01:50:45,520
That's a good move for it too.

3757
01:50:45,521 --> 01:50:46,510
I know people who've done that.

3758
01:50:46,511 --> 01:50:47,344
That's a good move.

3759
01:50:47,410 --> 01:50:47,950
I get that.

3760
01:50:47,950 --> 01:50:52,000
Make $15,000 but if you
have children I can get,

3761
01:50:52,001 --> 01:50:57,001
I can understand why a woman would want
some sort of a legally binding sort of

3762
01:50:57,070 --> 01:51:00,520
some sort of a insurance that she's going
to be getting money from this guy that

3763
01:51:00,880 --> 01:51:02,470
she had babies with.

3764
01:51:02,560 --> 01:51:03,400
That makes sense to me.

3765
01:51:03,880 --> 01:51:08,020
You know what drives me crazy
though is the non baby alimony.

3766
01:51:08,200 --> 01:51:08,370
My,

3767
01:51:08,370 --> 01:51:10,600
you don't have babies and
you have to pay forever.

3768
01:51:10,870 --> 01:51:13,720
Like I have a buddy who was married for
more than 12 years and if you know a

3769
01:51:13,721 --> 01:51:14,620
California works,

3770
01:51:14,890 --> 01:51:16,000
but California works,

3771
01:51:16,001 --> 01:51:16,241
if he,

3772
01:51:16,241 --> 01:51:17,680
if it goes over a certain amount of years,

3773
01:51:17,681 --> 01:51:20,270
I think it's like 12 you
have to pay alimony forever,

3774
01:51:20,580 --> 01:51:21,210
forever,

3775
01:51:21,210 --> 01:51:21,790
forever,

3776
01:51:21,790 --> 01:51:22,271
forever,

3777
01:51:22,271 --> 01:51:22,980
forever.

3778
01:51:22,980 --> 01:51:23,350
Forever,

3779
01:51:23,350 --> 01:51:23,740
forever.

3780
01:51:23,740 --> 01:51:24,573
Until they die.

3781
01:51:25,020 --> 01:51:25,191
No,

3782
01:51:25,191 --> 01:51:26,080
and there's no kids.

3783
01:51:26,170 --> 01:51:27,003
There's no kids.

3784
01:51:27,190 --> 01:51:27,671
Here's my,

3785
01:51:27,671 --> 01:51:29,230
here's my friend's story at common law.

3786
01:51:29,231 --> 01:51:30,064
Married,

3787
01:51:30,070 --> 01:51:30,700
married,

3788
01:51:30,700 --> 01:51:31,121
common law.

3789
01:51:31,121 --> 01:51:32,740
Marriage I believe is a much different,

3790
01:51:33,010 --> 01:51:35,710
I think you could just sue the shit out
of somebody if you have a common law

3791
01:51:35,711 --> 01:51:36,101
marriage,

3792
01:51:36,101 --> 01:51:38,650
like have you been living together and
they've been supporting you for certain

3793
01:51:38,651 --> 01:51:39,484
amount of time.

3794
01:51:39,520 --> 01:51:40,330
But this is,

3795
01:51:40,330 --> 01:51:43,150
this is my friend's story and
this is a very good friend.

3796
01:51:43,151 --> 01:51:45,070
So I know the details of this intimately.

3797
01:51:45,071 --> 01:51:49,060
I've had fucking sweaty conversations
with this guy where if I introduced him to

3798
01:51:49,061 --> 01:51:49,894
a Hitman,

3799
01:51:49,990 --> 01:51:51,340
he probably would have taken it.

3800
01:51:51,610 --> 01:51:52,810
He probably would have not really,

3801
01:51:52,811 --> 01:51:53,644
he's not a murderer.

3802
01:51:53,890 --> 01:51:55,090
I don't want to get my friend in trouble.

3803
01:51:55,360 --> 01:52:00,360
But my friend was married to this woman
for a long time and the last few years

3804
01:52:01,271 --> 01:52:02,860
it was real rough and he's just like,

3805
01:52:02,861 --> 01:52:04,480
God damn and I can't do this anymore.

3806
01:52:04,481 --> 01:52:05,470
And he doesn't know what to do.

3807
01:52:05,860 --> 01:52:06,520
And then,

3808
01:52:06,520 --> 01:52:06,881
uh,

3809
01:52:06,881 --> 01:52:11,590
one day decided to get out and she was
furious and she prolonged the divorce

3810
01:52:11,591 --> 01:52:12,251
forever.

3811
01:52:12,251 --> 01:52:15,790
She tortured him during the divorce
because when you don't have a Prenup,

3812
01:52:15,970 --> 01:52:18,070
then you have to argue over
each point of the divorce.

3813
01:52:18,250 --> 01:52:18,910
Well,

3814
01:52:18,910 --> 01:52:21,640
her idea was since it was all his money,

3815
01:52:21,820 --> 01:52:24,430
because she didn't have a job
and he was supporting her,

3816
01:52:24,550 --> 01:52:27,550
he had to pay for her lawyer
as well as his lawyer.

3817
01:52:27,580 --> 01:52:31,570
I heard some lawyers do it for free
knowing that they'll get paid at the end.

3818
01:52:31,690 --> 01:52:31,990
Oh,

3819
01:52:31,990 --> 01:52:34,030
most certainly they would do that,

3820
01:52:34,060 --> 01:52:35,740
but they don't have to do that.

3821
01:52:36,010 --> 01:52:39,970
If the woman is in a scenario where the
man pays for everything and she doesn't

3822
01:52:39,971 --> 01:52:40,804
have a job,

3823
01:52:40,840 --> 01:52:43,180
well the man has to pay
for her fucking divorce.

3824
01:52:43,360 --> 01:52:47,360
It's like going to war and you have
to pay for the other armies general.

3825
01:52:47,430 --> 01:52:51,560
She doesn't have a job and has no income
and has been living off of whatever he

3826
01:52:51,561 --> 01:52:52,394
makes.

3827
01:52:52,460 --> 01:52:55,580
How are they supposed to go to court
if he doesn't pay for her lawyer?

3828
01:52:55,770 --> 01:52:56,603
Get a fucking job.

3829
01:52:56,660 --> 01:52:56,841
I mean,

3830
01:52:56,841 --> 01:52:57,171
she's done.

3831
01:52:57,171 --> 01:52:57,861
She doesn't have kids.

3832
01:52:57,861 --> 01:52:59,630
There's no reason why
she doesn't have a job,

3833
01:52:59,810 --> 01:53:00,081
but he,

3834
01:53:00,081 --> 01:53:01,550
even though he doesn't want
to be with her anymore,

3835
01:53:01,551 --> 01:53:03,140
he's legally bound to be with her.

3836
01:53:03,141 --> 01:53:03,590
Okay,

3837
01:53:03,590 --> 01:53:04,790
so he has this,

3838
01:53:04,850 --> 01:53:06,290
this law contract with her,

3839
01:53:06,291 --> 01:53:07,940
this legal marriage contract,

3840
01:53:08,450 --> 01:53:13,450
and it goes on for almost two
years where she makes an agreement.

3841
01:53:13,551 --> 01:53:14,040
They,

3842
01:53:14,040 --> 01:53:17,060
they'd come to some sort of agreement
and then she drags it out even further.

3843
01:53:17,060 --> 01:53:17,910
She changes the,

3844
01:53:17,920 --> 01:53:19,970
what she wants and she's
allowed to do that.

3845
01:53:20,210 --> 01:53:21,050
She's allowed to change it,

3846
01:53:21,051 --> 01:53:21,481
whatever she would,

3847
01:53:21,481 --> 01:53:22,940
she doesn't have to agree to anything.

3848
01:53:23,150 --> 01:53:24,670
So she keeps fighting it as,

3849
01:53:24,750 --> 01:53:26,450
since she's fighting it with his money.

3850
01:53:26,660 --> 01:53:29,980
She's just bullying Yam and bleeding.

3851
01:53:29,981 --> 01:53:30,150
I mean,

3852
01:53:30,150 --> 01:53:31,310
she knows he has a lot of money.

3853
01:53:31,340 --> 01:53:33,200
She knows exactly how much money he makes,

3854
01:53:33,320 --> 01:53:35,780
so she keeps bleeding them
over and over and over again.

3855
01:53:35,810 --> 01:53:37,280
She used to do his bookkeeping.

3856
01:53:37,310 --> 01:53:37,640
No,

3857
01:53:37,640 --> 01:53:38,420
she didn't do his bookkeeping.

3858
01:53:38,420 --> 01:53:39,650
She's doing a damn thing.

3859
01:53:39,651 --> 01:53:42,200
She walked a little dog
around Pacific Palisades.

3860
01:53:42,320 --> 01:53:43,153
That's what she did.

3861
01:53:43,250 --> 01:53:44,180
She didn't do nothing.

3862
01:53:44,240 --> 01:53:47,270
Isn't that where Jeffrey Lash was a yes,

3863
01:53:47,271 --> 01:53:48,140
this woman's an alien.

3864
01:53:48,530 --> 01:53:49,363
Anyway,

3865
01:53:49,640 --> 01:53:50,210
anyway,

3866
01:53:50,210 --> 01:53:54,590
my point is this shit went on for
like two years and cost him insane,

3867
01:53:54,620 --> 01:53:56,150
ungodly amounts of money.

3868
01:53:56,330 --> 01:53:58,070
Then after it's all over,

3869
01:53:58,071 --> 01:53:59,030
he lost his house.

3870
01:53:59,120 --> 01:54:01,580
So she lives in this beautiful house.

3871
01:54:01,580 --> 01:54:02,750
It's overlooking the ocean.

3872
01:54:02,751 --> 01:54:02,931
I mean,

3873
01:54:02,931 --> 01:54:04,070
it is fucking stunning.

3874
01:54:04,220 --> 01:54:05,000
It's amazing house.

3875
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:10,000
And he has to pay her alimony for the
rest of her life until she gets married.

3876
01:54:11,660 --> 01:54:13,650
If she gets married or
cohabitating with a man.

3877
01:54:13,920 --> 01:54:14,480
Ah,

3878
01:54:14,480 --> 01:54:15,300
but that's where,

3879
01:54:15,300 --> 01:54:16,133
this is where it's crazy.

3880
01:54:16,190 --> 01:54:17,510
So now she has a boyfriend,

3881
01:54:17,780 --> 01:54:19,400
but the boyfriend lives with her.

3882
01:54:19,401 --> 01:54:22,100
Why would he live in his fucking shitty
house when they can live with this

3883
01:54:22,101 --> 01:54:24,170
beautiful house overlooking the ocean?

3884
01:54:24,470 --> 01:54:29,470
So the boyfriend moves in and then they
sent inspectors over to find out if the

3885
01:54:30,411 --> 01:54:31,610
boyfriend is living there.

3886
01:54:31,700 --> 01:54:33,290
She knows the inspectors are coming.

3887
01:54:33,350 --> 01:54:34,850
So he grabs all this stuff,

3888
01:54:34,880 --> 01:54:36,080
puts in a fucking u haul,

3889
01:54:36,081 --> 01:54:38,780
literally drives a mile away.

3890
01:54:38,930 --> 01:54:40,040
Parks the u haul,

3891
01:54:40,130 --> 01:54:41,710
waits for the inspectors to leave.

3892
01:54:41,840 --> 01:54:42,980
Turns back around,

3893
01:54:43,130 --> 01:54:45,320
reloads all his shit back
into the house again,

3894
01:54:46,560 --> 01:54:46,941
because he,

3895
01:54:46,941 --> 01:54:47,270
if,

3896
01:54:47,270 --> 01:54:50,750
if this guy and her married
the gravy train stops.

3897
01:54:50,960 --> 01:54:52,810
But if the guy and her are together,

3898
01:54:52,830 --> 01:54:57,830
she gets hundreds of thousands
of dollars every year,

3899
01:54:58,040 --> 01:55:00,440
hundreds of thousands of dollars.

3900
01:55:00,740 --> 01:55:02,300
Like she's living up in,

3901
01:55:02,580 --> 01:55:06,500
they went lifestyle with a man
that she just used to date.

3902
01:55:06,650 --> 01:55:07,341
She used to date him.

3903
01:55:07,341 --> 01:55:10,610
They haven't been together like
romantically in more than a decade.

3904
01:55:10,760 --> 01:55:14,090
But this guy every week
is writing fat checks,

3905
01:55:14,210 --> 01:55:17,240
fat fucking checks and
sending them off in the mail.

3906
01:55:17,360 --> 01:55:18,080
Hundreds,

3907
01:55:18,080 --> 01:55:19,070
it's driving him mad.

3908
01:55:19,100 --> 01:55:20,450
That's what Trump should run on.

3909
01:55:21,170 --> 01:55:21,351
What?

3910
01:55:21,351 --> 01:55:21,860
Divorce.

3911
01:55:21,860 --> 01:55:22,693
Alimony.

3912
01:55:23,720 --> 01:55:25,220
But it doesn't always work that way.

3913
01:55:25,221 --> 01:55:26,240
It's like this guy just,

3914
01:55:26,241 --> 01:55:29,990
it was a combination of a ruthless
woman who knows the system.

3915
01:55:30,200 --> 01:55:33,260
Good lawyers that can manipulate
a guy who makes a lot of money.

3916
01:55:33,620 --> 01:55:33,801
You know,

3917
01:55:33,801 --> 01:55:34,550
there's a lot of,

3918
01:55:34,550 --> 01:55:35,690
a lot of stuff involved in it.

3919
01:55:35,691 --> 01:55:36,524
He should uh,

3920
01:55:36,710 --> 01:55:39,800
hire inspectors are private investigators.

3921
01:55:39,860 --> 01:55:41,390
Get the inspectors to come back,

3922
01:55:41,391 --> 01:55:43,510
have the video of them taking it.

3923
01:55:44,510 --> 01:55:45,343
Not good enough.

3924
01:55:45,390 --> 01:55:46,260
It's not good enough.

3925
01:55:46,410 --> 01:55:46,570
He,

3926
01:55:46,570 --> 01:55:47,400
he could,

3927
01:55:47,400 --> 01:55:49,410
he could leave a certain
amount of personal items there.

3928
01:55:49,620 --> 01:55:50,010
The point,

3929
01:55:50,010 --> 01:55:51,460
the point is like he,

3930
01:55:51,580 --> 01:55:52,650
they're manipulating it.

3931
01:55:52,860 --> 01:55:55,770
Like all he has to do is keep an
apartment and he'd get of the shittiest

3932
01:55:55,771 --> 01:55:57,450
apartment in Compton and then like,

3933
01:55:57,451 --> 01:55:57,631
no,

3934
01:55:57,631 --> 01:55:58,464
this is my place.

3935
01:55:58,500 --> 01:56:01,110
And like stay over her
house 99% of the time.

3936
01:56:01,320 --> 01:56:02,071
Just go over his house,

3937
01:56:02,071 --> 01:56:04,920
take a shit and leave and
force them to get married.

3938
01:56:04,950 --> 01:56:05,400
Nope.

3939
01:56:05,400 --> 01:56:07,020
All they can't get on your knees.

3940
01:56:07,350 --> 01:56:08,880
Bitch proposed right now.

3941
01:56:09,210 --> 01:56:09,500
Yeah.

3942
01:56:09,500 --> 01:56:10,440
And because it's,

3943
01:56:10,441 --> 01:56:12,270
if it's common law after
a certain amount of years,

3944
01:56:12,271 --> 01:56:14,400
I wonder if the money stops then bell.

3945
01:56:14,401 --> 01:56:15,061
Either way.

3946
01:56:15,061 --> 01:56:18,840
This guy is just beyond fucked and
it drives him crazy and he doesn't,

3947
01:56:19,010 --> 01:56:19,450
you know,

3948
01:56:19,450 --> 01:56:21,090
he doesn't even like this person.

3949
01:56:21,091 --> 01:56:25,290
Not only does he not like or he knows
that she spent millions of dollars fight

3950
01:56:25,320 --> 01:56:26,130
of his money,

3951
01:56:26,130 --> 01:56:28,290
fighting him in this divorce settlement.

3952
01:56:28,560 --> 01:56:29,600
And then once it came in,

3953
01:56:30,200 --> 01:56:32,070
I was talking about a guy
who did anything terrible.

3954
01:56:32,190 --> 01:56:33,190
He didn't kill anybody.

3955
01:56:33,191 --> 01:56:34,170
He didn't rob anybody.

3956
01:56:34,171 --> 01:56:34,650
He didn't.

3957
01:56:34,650 --> 01:56:39,650
But he's become a victim of legal system
and this legal system has him obligated

3958
01:56:40,201 --> 01:56:44,610
to pay this woman until she
stops breathing on planet earth.

3959
01:56:45,030 --> 01:56:46,110
She's Christ,

3960
01:56:46,600 --> 01:56:47,670
so fuck California.

3961
01:56:47,671 --> 01:56:48,930
So she's only like,

3962
01:56:49,110 --> 01:56:51,660
I think she's in her
forties so for 12 years.

3963
01:56:52,080 --> 01:56:52,530
Yeah.

3964
01:56:52,530 --> 01:56:53,760
So if they,

3965
01:56:53,970 --> 01:56:56,160
if they live another 30 or 40 years,

3966
01:56:56,310 --> 01:56:57,430
this fucking guy has to pay,

3967
01:56:57,431 --> 01:56:59,130
or hundreds of thousands
of dollars a year.

3968
01:56:59,280 --> 01:57:00,570
And I think it's almost a million.

3969
01:57:00,750 --> 01:57:02,700
I think it's not just
hundreds of thousands.

3970
01:57:02,701 --> 01:57:03,391
I think it's many,

3971
01:57:03,391 --> 01:57:04,350
many hundreds of thousands.

3972
01:57:04,500 --> 01:57:05,550
And he's a wealthy man.

3973
01:57:05,640 --> 01:57:06,301
Don't get me wrong,

3974
01:57:06,301 --> 01:57:07,140
he's done very well,

3975
01:57:07,141 --> 01:57:08,700
but he works for a living.

3976
01:57:08,880 --> 01:57:12,260
And this is a guy who has his
own business checks for a living.

3977
01:57:12,270 --> 01:57:12,811
He's not a,

3978
01:57:12,811 --> 01:57:13,620
he's not a thief.

3979
01:57:13,620 --> 01:57:13,801
I mean,

3980
01:57:13,801 --> 01:57:14,231
he's not like,

3981
01:57:14,231 --> 01:57:14,760
this is not,

3982
01:57:14,760 --> 01:57:17,490
his guy's not doing anything
unscrupulous to make this money.

3983
01:57:17,491 --> 01:57:20,940
So this is all money that
he earned because he runs
his own business and he's a

3984
01:57:20,941 --> 01:57:21,930
fucking workhorse,

3985
01:57:21,931 --> 01:57:22,740
this guy.

3986
01:57:22,740 --> 01:57:25,260
And he dated a woman that
was better looking than him.

3987
01:57:25,560 --> 01:57:26,393
He fucked up.

3988
01:57:26,550 --> 01:57:26,881
He dated.

3989
01:57:26,881 --> 01:57:29,010
A woman has better looking at
him and it didn't work out.

3990
01:57:29,280 --> 01:57:29,821
And then,

3991
01:57:29,821 --> 01:57:30,181
you know,

3992
01:57:30,181 --> 01:57:30,930
he just thought,

3993
01:57:30,930 --> 01:57:32,160
I don't need a prenuptial.

3994
01:57:32,161 --> 01:57:32,790
I love her.

3995
01:57:32,790 --> 01:57:33,900
She hasn't won a prenuptial.

3996
01:57:34,230 --> 01:57:35,460
So this is how crazy this guy is.

3997
01:57:35,880 --> 01:57:40,830
He gets married again after this and
his new wife wants to have no prenup.

3998
01:57:41,340 --> 01:57:42,130
And he was,

3999
01:57:42,130 --> 01:57:45,030
he was thinking of going through with
it and everybody was fucking grabbing

4000
01:57:45,680 --> 01:57:46,513
this.

4001
01:57:47,370 --> 01:57:50,550
We've been going through this with
you for the past three fucking years.

4002
01:57:50,670 --> 01:57:52,330
You are not going to do it.

4003
01:57:52,680 --> 01:57:52,891
No,

4004
01:57:52,891 --> 01:57:53,220
he didn't.

4005
01:57:53,220 --> 01:57:54,053
He got a Prenup,

4006
01:57:54,060 --> 01:57:55,380
got a very generous Prenup,

4007
01:57:55,381 --> 01:57:56,660
but as a prenup and they got married.

4008
01:57:56,760 --> 01:57:58,470
The point being a prenup at least if it,

4009
01:57:58,471 --> 01:57:59,430
even if it's ridiculous,

4010
01:57:59,431 --> 01:58:02,370
even if like you know Esther and Brian
get married and and Brian is to pay

4011
01:58:02,380 --> 01:58:05,100
Esther a million dollars a
year for the rest of her life.

4012
01:58:05,101 --> 01:58:05,910
If they break up,

4013
01:58:05,910 --> 01:58:08,400
at least that's set in
stone where she can't say,

4014
01:58:08,401 --> 01:58:09,420
fuck you Brian,

4015
01:58:09,510 --> 01:58:10,740
I want $3 million.

4016
01:58:10,800 --> 01:58:12,750
I can't believe I sucked your
Dick or can't believe that.

4017
01:58:14,200 --> 01:58:17,190
That's what happens when people get angry
at each other when they get divorced.

4018
01:58:17,191 --> 01:58:20,220
They just fight and they fight and
they fight and then there becomes this,

4019
01:58:20,221 --> 01:58:23,310
I'm going to break this motherfucker
and then you figured out how to do it.

4020
01:58:23,370 --> 01:58:24,990
Getting married is a divorce.

4021
01:58:24,991 --> 01:58:27,450
Fights sound fucking awful.

4022
01:58:27,540 --> 01:58:30,390
Well the only sound awful
because they can be awful.

4023
01:58:30,420 --> 01:58:32,850
That's the thing that's
really crazy about marriage.

4024
01:58:32,960 --> 01:58:33,210
It just,

4025
01:58:33,210 --> 01:58:34,650
cause they can be awful.

4026
01:58:34,770 --> 01:58:35,850
You can demand,

4027
01:58:36,170 --> 01:58:38,550
there's a legal thing going on.

4028
01:58:38,580 --> 01:58:43,060
There's a contract that's disputed
so you can battle about it.

4029
01:58:43,210 --> 01:58:45,640
Whereas like if you guys were just dating,

4030
01:58:45,730 --> 01:58:46,750
okay and you broke up.

4031
01:58:46,751 --> 01:58:47,350
Well that's it.

4032
01:58:47,350 --> 01:58:48,183
It's over.

4033
01:58:48,260 --> 01:58:48,580
I,

4034
01:58:48,580 --> 01:58:49,151
Brian says,

4035
01:58:49,151 --> 01:58:50,080
I don't want to date you anymore.

4036
01:58:50,200 --> 01:58:50,591
And you're like,

4037
01:58:50,591 --> 01:58:51,371
fuck you went on a date.

4038
01:58:51,371 --> 01:58:51,911
You anymore either,

4039
01:58:51,911 --> 01:58:52,750
but I want money.

4040
01:58:53,290 --> 01:58:53,921
Brian would be like,

4041
01:58:53,921 --> 01:58:54,641
what are you talking about?

4042
01:58:54,641 --> 01:58:55,560
I'm not giving you money.

4043
01:58:55,780 --> 01:58:56,613
Get away from me.

4044
01:58:56,770 --> 01:58:57,760
You know like get Outta here.

4045
01:58:57,761 --> 01:58:58,181
Stop.

4046
01:58:58,181 --> 01:58:59,410
Will you change your phone number?

4047
01:58:59,411 --> 01:59:00,160
And we're over.

4048
01:59:00,160 --> 01:59:00,841
It's over the,

4049
01:59:00,841 --> 01:59:01,031
the,

4050
01:59:01,031 --> 01:59:01,290
the,

4051
01:59:01,290 --> 01:59:01,440
the,

4052
01:59:01,440 --> 01:59:02,500
the battle ends.

4053
01:59:02,710 --> 01:59:03,730
But if you're married,

4054
01:59:04,620 --> 01:59:08,260
the battle is just be just be guys.

4055
01:59:08,740 --> 01:59:10,480
And then the lawyers
get together and they,

4056
01:59:10,481 --> 01:59:13,300
they touch each other and
they rub hands and they go,

4057
01:59:13,301 --> 01:59:16,570
we're going to clean this motherfucker
out because you've got two lawyers who

4058
01:59:16,571 --> 01:59:20,920
are working for the same guy and
they're battling a different position.

4059
01:59:21,190 --> 01:59:21,970
One boy,

4060
01:59:21,970 --> 01:59:23,470
he's working for you,

4061
01:59:23,560 --> 01:59:25,510
but you're battling for the wife,

4062
01:59:25,660 --> 01:59:27,640
but you're still getting the
checks from the same guy.

4063
01:59:27,710 --> 01:59:28,440
He's fun.

4064
01:59:28,440 --> 01:59:31,210
So they know that they only have
to do is stretch this dance out.

4065
01:59:31,390 --> 01:59:35,140
So they kept this dance going
for I think more than two years.

4066
01:59:35,260 --> 01:59:36,130
More than two years.

4067
01:59:36,131 --> 01:59:37,310
This guy was going through divorce.

4068
01:59:37,890 --> 01:59:38,723
Wow.

4069
01:59:39,010 --> 01:59:39,843
Jess

4070
01:59:40,820 --> 01:59:42,370
and I would see me be gray,

4071
01:59:42,580 --> 01:59:43,840
like gray skin,

4072
01:59:43,900 --> 01:59:47,290
sweaty and fucking just
freaking the fuck out.

4073
01:59:47,590 --> 01:59:49,210
Just hemorrhaging money,

4074
01:59:49,360 --> 01:59:51,400
hemorrhaging and working all day,

4075
01:59:51,550 --> 01:59:52,270
working everyday,

4076
01:59:52,270 --> 01:59:52,571
nine,

4077
01:59:52,571 --> 01:59:53,404
10 hours a day,

4078
01:59:53,590 --> 01:59:54,071
coming home.

4079
01:59:54,071 --> 01:59:54,904
Exhausted.

4080
01:59:55,660 --> 01:59:56,350
Yes.

4081
01:59:56,350 --> 01:59:56,591
Yes.

4082
01:59:56,591 --> 01:59:57,424
You want to kids.

4083
01:59:57,700 --> 01:59:58,900
It's not just that he,

4084
01:59:58,901 --> 01:59:59,190
uh,

4085
01:59:59,190 --> 01:59:59,560
you know,

4086
01:59:59,560 --> 02:00:00,400
he loves this woman.

4087
02:00:00,401 --> 02:00:01,181
Just those other women.

4088
02:00:01,181 --> 02:00:01,690
The ladies just not,

4089
02:00:01,690 --> 02:00:03,610
it's not that he doesn't
believe in relationships,

4090
02:00:03,700 --> 02:00:06,370
it's just the relationship
that he had just didn't work.

4091
02:00:06,610 --> 02:00:07,121
And he was,

4092
02:00:07,121 --> 02:00:07,740
you know,

4093
02:00:07,740 --> 02:00:08,740
he just couldn't,

4094
02:00:08,890 --> 02:00:10,180
sometimes it doesn't work.

4095
02:00:10,630 --> 02:00:12,010
Sometimes people are great,

4096
02:00:12,040 --> 02:00:16,240
sometimes you're great and he's great
to pay alimony to the guy because when

4097
02:00:16,241 --> 02:00:17,110
they started going out,

4098
02:00:17,111 --> 02:00:20,170
he was making more money and then she
started surpassing him and wrote a

4099
02:00:20,171 --> 02:00:20,741
screenplay.

4100
02:00:20,741 --> 02:00:23,830
And then those moments are so rare.

4101
02:00:23,831 --> 02:00:25,450
I hate when people even talk about them.

4102
02:00:25,600 --> 02:00:28,480
That's like the when when women
say sometimes women rape men.

4103
02:00:29,500 --> 02:00:30,310
Okay,

4104
02:00:30,310 --> 02:00:35,290
maybe they do it a million times
that the women are paying alimony.

4105
02:00:35,291 --> 02:00:36,124
How rare are those

4106
02:00:38,150 --> 02:00:38,983
50 Joe?

4107
02:00:40,810 --> 02:00:41,341
Well then with,

4108
02:00:41,341 --> 02:00:43,000
it would be a good
argument to quit alimony.

4109
02:00:43,001 --> 02:00:43,930
Let's just bail on it.

4110
02:00:44,140 --> 02:00:44,973
You know,

4111
02:00:45,070 --> 02:00:46,480
I think alimony is nonsense.

4112
02:00:46,720 --> 02:00:49,600
I think if you do have someone know that
you've been taken care of for a certain

4113
02:00:49,601 --> 02:00:50,320
amount of time,

4114
02:00:50,320 --> 02:00:52,480
like if you care about them at all,

4115
02:00:52,660 --> 02:00:55,180
you have an obligation to help them.

4116
02:00:55,181 --> 02:00:55,571
You know what?

4117
02:00:55,571 --> 02:00:57,400
I don't like people
struggling financially.

4118
02:00:57,400 --> 02:00:59,140
I think it's a horrible thing to see.

4119
02:00:59,410 --> 02:01:01,390
That's one of the most
stressful things in your life.

4120
02:01:01,660 --> 02:01:06,330
And if someone can help someone and was
sort of like help them move along till

4121
02:01:06,331 --> 02:01:08,530
like a more prosperous
future without them.

4122
02:01:08,590 --> 02:01:09,610
There's nothing wrong with that.

4123
02:01:09,880 --> 02:01:12,700
But when you get obligations
like my friend who's like,

4124
02:01:12,701 --> 02:01:15,820
I think he has to be
seven or $800,000 a year,

4125
02:01:16,200 --> 02:01:17,110
she is forever.

4126
02:01:17,710 --> 02:01:18,543
Forever.

4127
02:01:18,580 --> 02:01:19,700
What if he start lakes?

4128
02:01:20,080 --> 02:01:22,450
What if he doesn't make
as much money next year?

4129
02:01:22,520 --> 02:01:22,991
And you know what,

4130
02:01:22,991 --> 02:01:23,830
I think I might be wrong.

4131
02:01:23,860 --> 02:01:26,480
I think it's more than a million now that
I'm thinking about it because there's

4132
02:01:26,500 --> 02:01:27,333
a bunch of other,

4133
02:01:27,460 --> 02:01:29,080
there's like a bunch of shit tacked in.

4134
02:01:29,500 --> 02:01:30,100
There's all this,

4135
02:01:30,100 --> 02:01:30,341
oh,

4136
02:01:30,341 --> 02:01:31,174
it's so crazy.

4137
02:01:31,630 --> 02:01:32,980
And this is like what he settled on.

4138
02:01:33,120 --> 02:01:37,150
This is what he settled for 400 over
400,000 people in the United States

4139
02:01:37,151 --> 02:01:38,140
receiving post divorce,

4140
02:01:38,141 --> 02:01:38,861
spousal maintenance,

4141
02:01:38,861 --> 02:01:40,010
just percent were men.

4142
02:01:41,360 --> 02:01:42,950
And how many of those
were from the gay dudes?

4143
02:01:43,700 --> 02:01:44,211
How many of those?

4144
02:01:44,211 --> 02:01:46,100
Cause Miss Melissa
Etheridge plays alimony.

4145
02:01:46,101 --> 02:01:47,060
Two or two ex wives.

4146
02:01:47,420 --> 02:01:48,860
It's funny gracing.

4147
02:01:48,920 --> 02:01:50,210
Anybody ever said on this podcast,

4148
02:01:50,630 --> 02:01:51,231
I asked her,

4149
02:01:51,231 --> 02:01:51,471
I go,

4150
02:01:51,471 --> 02:01:51,751
how do you,

4151
02:01:51,751 --> 02:01:52,521
can I go?

4152
02:01:52,521 --> 02:01:54,670
How are you paying alimony
to two ex wives go,

4153
02:01:54,750 --> 02:01:55,583
she goes,

4154
02:01:55,880 --> 02:01:56,720
bitches are crazy.

4155
02:02:02,080 --> 02:02:02,913
She might have,

4156
02:02:03,610 --> 02:02:08,170
she might be one of them fucking Turkey
based or ladies put the strap on a

4157
02:02:08,171 --> 02:02:09,820
Turkey based turns like shit.

4158
02:02:11,700 --> 02:02:12,370
Yeah,

4159
02:02:12,370 --> 02:02:17,370
she was it her that had like David
Crosby's come and pregnant in one of her

4160
02:02:17,891 --> 02:02:19,120
girlfriends or something like that.

4161
02:02:19,820 --> 02:02:20,740
People get freaky,

4162
02:02:21,340 --> 02:02:21,880
you know,

4163
02:02:21,880 --> 02:02:23,380
they do little things.

4164
02:02:24,160 --> 02:02:25,650
Try to do a little test things.

4165
02:02:26,050 --> 02:02:28,870
This gay couple of live down the
street from me and the guy is,

4166
02:02:28,871 --> 02:02:32,440
there's one guy that works all the time
and the other guys like sorta the house

4167
02:02:32,441 --> 02:02:33,010
husband,

4168
02:02:33,010 --> 02:02:33,750
they have a great,

4169
02:02:33,750 --> 02:02:35,290
great relationship with a housewife.

4170
02:02:35,590 --> 02:02:36,220
You know,

4171
02:02:36,220 --> 02:02:37,910
they have a kid and uh,

4172
02:02:37,911 --> 02:02:38,170
the,

4173
02:02:38,170 --> 02:02:42,200
the guy that doesn't work does most
of the taking care of the kid and his

4174
02:02:42,250 --> 02:02:43,083
beautiful,

4175
02:02:43,150 --> 02:02:44,200
it works for them.

4176
02:02:44,320 --> 02:02:46,780
They're there sweeties
they're the nicest folks.

4177
02:02:46,960 --> 02:02:47,591
They're like their,

4178
02:02:47,591 --> 02:02:47,831
you know,

4179
02:02:47,831 --> 02:02:51,130
their kid comes over parties
and stuff and they're like,

4180
02:02:51,160 --> 02:02:52,900
their kid is the same age as my kids.

4181
02:02:53,060 --> 02:02:54,610
We played together all the time.

4182
02:02:54,670 --> 02:02:56,920
He's always over the house
to the nicest people.

4183
02:02:56,921 --> 02:02:59,590
Just for someone who
doesn't know gay people,

4184
02:02:59,591 --> 02:03:02,440
it just seems weird that these two guys
are in love with each other and that

4185
02:03:02,441 --> 02:03:03,550
they hold hands and,

4186
02:03:03,790 --> 02:03:05,050
but once you get used to them,

4187
02:03:05,051 --> 02:03:06,070
the dynamic of them,

4188
02:03:06,071 --> 02:03:06,940
you know who they are,

4189
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:07,930
they're the nicest,

4190
02:03:07,931 --> 02:03:10,120
friendliest people and they get along.

4191
02:03:10,150 --> 02:03:10,931
It works great.

4192
02:03:10,931 --> 02:03:12,130
Like they'd been together for years

4193
02:03:12,200 --> 02:03:12,831
and the kids,

4194
02:03:12,831 --> 02:03:14,840
not traumatized kids fine.

4195
02:03:14,870 --> 02:03:16,460
The kids like this is awesome.

4196
02:03:16,461 --> 02:03:17,510
My Dad's are awesome.

4197
02:03:17,750 --> 02:03:19,080
One of the reasons why the kids finds,

4198
02:03:19,090 --> 02:03:22,300
because we live in California
and California is very
open minded when it comes

4199
02:03:22,301 --> 02:03:22,930
to gay people,

4200
02:03:22,930 --> 02:03:25,780
it's more open minded I think in
any place else I've ever lived.

4201
02:03:26,260 --> 02:03:27,093
It's like uh,

4202
02:03:27,160 --> 02:03:27,881
you know,

4203
02:03:27,881 --> 02:03:30,110
so much so that it's,

4204
02:03:30,220 --> 02:03:35,220
it's becoming more of an issue if you're
a homophobe than it is if you're gay.

4205
02:03:35,770 --> 02:03:37,540
Like if people find out you're homophobic,

4206
02:03:37,541 --> 02:03:38,680
it's so repulsive.

4207
02:03:38,681 --> 02:03:38,951
It's like,

4208
02:03:38,951 --> 02:03:40,060
what do you give a shit?

4209
02:03:40,270 --> 02:03:42,310
I that's more repulsive than it is.

4210
02:03:42,311 --> 02:03:44,020
Like if you're a homophobic person,

4211
02:03:44,021 --> 02:03:45,650
you see a gay person like this,

4212
02:03:45,670 --> 02:03:46,960
it's almost more,

4213
02:03:47,410 --> 02:03:51,340
more stigmatizing to be
homophobic than it is.

4214
02:03:51,341 --> 02:03:54,550
Like as far as like numbers go
than it is to be gay almost.

4215
02:03:54,900 --> 02:03:55,740
That would be the goal,

4216
02:03:55,741 --> 02:03:56,041
right?

4217
02:03:56,041 --> 02:03:58,970
The goal would be to make
being a homophobe horrible.

4218
02:03:58,990 --> 02:04:02,160
He's just amazing as far as just people.

4219
02:04:02,490 --> 02:04:06,210
People don't want to offend you that
they go so far as to like be like,

4220
02:04:06,240 --> 02:04:06,541
oh,

4221
02:04:06,541 --> 02:04:07,410
what'd you like to,

4222
02:04:07,700 --> 02:04:08,131
you know,

4223
02:04:08,131 --> 02:04:09,370
get a breast implant?

4224
02:04:09,371 --> 02:04:09,510
Who,

4225
02:04:09,510 --> 02:04:09,781
man,

4226
02:04:09,781 --> 02:04:10,351
you know what I mean?

4227
02:04:10,351 --> 02:04:12,510
Like it's just trans like gender.

4228
02:04:12,511 --> 02:04:13,950
People are just everywhere.

4229
02:04:13,951 --> 02:04:14,720
And it's,

4230
02:04:14,720 --> 02:04:15,570
it's so,

4231
02:04:15,571 --> 02:04:18,060
except there's a transgender
comedian in San Francisco.

4232
02:04:18,061 --> 02:04:18,894
Have you seen him?

4233
02:04:19,620 --> 02:04:19,951
Her,

4234
02:04:19,951 --> 02:04:20,680
sorry,

4235
02:04:20,680 --> 02:04:22,530
miss gendered chemists.

4236
02:04:22,560 --> 02:04:22,891
Gender.

4237
02:04:22,891 --> 02:04:23,760
It's super bad.

4238
02:04:25,380 --> 02:04:26,340
I forget her name,

4239
02:04:26,341 --> 02:04:27,570
but she was hilarious.

4240
02:04:28,030 --> 02:04:31,960
I don't understand people getting upset
at something is obviously a mistake as

4241
02:04:31,961 --> 02:04:32,794
miss gender.

4242
02:04:33,130 --> 02:04:36,760
Like if you used to be a man and now
you're a woman and someone actually calls

4243
02:04:36,761 --> 02:04:38,730
you relax.

4244
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:39,833
Okay,

4245
02:04:40,020 --> 02:04:40,853
relax.

4246
02:04:40,980 --> 02:04:42,260
Cause if you call me a she,

4247
02:04:42,450 --> 02:04:43,770
guess what I'm not getting upset at.

4248
02:04:43,771 --> 02:04:44,250
Yeah,

4249
02:04:44,250 --> 02:04:45,750
I'm just not if you like,

4250
02:04:45,751 --> 02:04:46,740
have you seen Joe Rogan?

4251
02:04:46,770 --> 02:04:47,191
Oh my God,

4252
02:04:47,191 --> 02:04:48,060
she's really funny.

4253
02:04:49,240 --> 02:04:49,480
Hmm.

4254
02:04:49,480 --> 02:04:51,240
On the regular wouldn't bug me,

4255
02:04:51,241 --> 02:04:51,581
you know,

4256
02:04:51,581 --> 02:04:52,570
like whatever.

4257
02:04:52,571 --> 02:04:53,620
So people call you a he,

4258
02:04:54,430 --> 02:04:56,680
I mean just like you make a mistake.

4259
02:04:56,681 --> 02:04:57,790
Like it's almost like,

4260
02:04:58,080 --> 02:04:58,710
like ma'am,

4261
02:04:58,710 --> 02:04:59,490
like when you got to go,

4262
02:04:59,490 --> 02:05:00,280
thanks ma'am.

4263
02:05:00,280 --> 02:05:00,670
Sure.

4264
02:05:00,670 --> 02:05:01,020
Right.

4265
02:05:01,020 --> 02:05:01,561
That's a dude.

4266
02:05:01,561 --> 02:05:02,010
What it is.

4267
02:05:02,010 --> 02:05:02,750
It's a mystery.

4268
02:05:02,750 --> 02:05:03,810
Call your your friend.

4269
02:05:03,811 --> 02:05:04,680
That's a girl brother.

4270
02:05:04,740 --> 02:05:05,161
All right brother.

4271
02:05:05,161 --> 02:05:05,994
I'll see you soon.

4272
02:05:06,190 --> 02:05:07,023
We'll miss that.

4273
02:05:07,100 --> 02:05:08,040
But oh dude.

4274
02:05:08,041 --> 02:05:08,580
Or Bro,

4275
02:05:08,580 --> 02:05:08,881
but to,

4276
02:05:08,881 --> 02:05:12,000
to dude's okay dude is
fruit called universal dude.

4277
02:05:12,060 --> 02:05:13,200
You're like guys like,

4278
02:05:13,201 --> 02:05:13,741
hey guys.

4279
02:05:13,741 --> 02:05:16,500
Like there could be like four
girls and a guy and he's like,

4280
02:05:16,501 --> 02:05:17,334
what's up guys?

4281
02:05:17,400 --> 02:05:20,550
And nobody gets upset and if they
do stop hanging out with them.

4282
02:05:20,850 --> 02:05:21,683
Right.

4283
02:05:22,050 --> 02:05:26,070
Because if someone says guys is not
really just got the problem is it's so

4284
02:05:26,071 --> 02:05:27,150
gender specific,

4285
02:05:27,151 --> 02:05:28,710
there's no like female

4286
02:05:30,270 --> 02:05:31,680
equivalent to guys,

4287
02:05:31,890 --> 02:05:32,221
you know,

4288
02:05:32,221 --> 02:05:34,300
where you could say a
bunch of girls can be guys,

4289
02:05:34,820 --> 02:05:36,420
but that just sounds dumb.

4290
02:05:36,650 --> 02:05:37,001
Do you have a,

4291
02:05:37,001 --> 02:05:37,631
nobody's scared.

4292
02:05:37,631 --> 02:05:38,340
You know what I'm saying?

4293
02:05:38,340 --> 02:05:38,581
No,

4294
02:05:38,581 --> 02:05:38,911
no,

4295
02:05:38,911 --> 02:05:40,230
no one uses it universally.

4296
02:05:40,380 --> 02:05:43,500
Like you don't see a group
of men and someone says,

4297
02:05:43,501 --> 02:05:45,390
hey girls or hey gals,

4298
02:05:45,600 --> 02:05:48,000
but you could see like five girls and go,

4299
02:05:48,001 --> 02:05:48,781
what's up guys?

4300
02:05:48,781 --> 02:05:49,614
What's up?

4301
02:05:49,650 --> 02:05:51,030
And somehow or another,

4302
02:05:51,031 --> 02:05:51,864
it's acceptable.

4303
02:05:51,960 --> 02:05:54,360
Girls like you can go up
to your friends and go,

4304
02:05:54,361 --> 02:05:55,590
what the fuck you guys doing?

4305
02:05:55,830 --> 02:05:56,880
You can actually say that,

4306
02:05:57,030 --> 02:05:57,520
right?

4307
02:05:57,520 --> 02:05:58,000
That's right.

4308
02:05:58,000 --> 02:05:58,960
It's not weird.

4309
02:05:58,990 --> 02:05:59,560
It's not weird.

4310
02:05:59,560 --> 02:06:01,390
It's like it happens all the time.

4311
02:06:01,630 --> 02:06:01,781
Yeah.

4312
02:06:01,781 --> 02:06:02,350
What is that?

4313
02:06:02,350 --> 02:06:03,183
How is that?

4314
02:06:03,760 --> 02:06:07,810
Because we just live in
such a male dominated world.

4315
02:06:08,050 --> 02:06:09,430
Is that frustrating being a woman?

4316
02:06:09,880 --> 02:06:10,713
Um,

4317
02:06:10,810 --> 02:06:13,150
well it was when I was a kid.

4318
02:06:13,180 --> 02:06:14,013
Yeah.

4319
02:06:14,410 --> 02:06:17,530
Because like I just was
surrounded by guys so I thought,

4320
02:06:17,650 --> 02:06:18,160
you know,

4321
02:06:18,160 --> 02:06:23,160
so I felt like I have three brothers so
I was just like constantly battling for

4322
02:06:24,491 --> 02:06:25,324
the toilet

4323
02:06:27,430 --> 02:06:27,870
is that way.

4324
02:06:27,870 --> 02:06:29,080
So I'm talking about poop.

4325
02:06:29,200 --> 02:06:29,801
Well No,

4326
02:06:29,801 --> 02:06:30,521
you know what it is.

4327
02:06:30,521 --> 02:06:35,110
It's like I grew up seeing my brother's
like pee in the toilet together cause

4328
02:06:35,111 --> 02:06:39,880
they could stand next to each other and
all p at the same time that I just got

4329
02:06:39,881 --> 02:06:40,571
so jealous.

4330
02:06:40,571 --> 02:06:40,960
I was like,

4331
02:06:40,960 --> 02:06:41,711
when I pee,

4332
02:06:41,711 --> 02:06:44,020
I take up the whole toilet by myself.

4333
02:06:44,021 --> 02:06:46,600
I can't hang out with people while peeing.

4334
02:06:47,410 --> 02:06:48,243
And I thought,

4335
02:06:48,310 --> 02:06:49,120
man,

4336
02:06:49,120 --> 02:06:49,960
it would be awesome.

4337
02:06:51,400 --> 02:06:52,690
You're going to see those things.

4338
02:06:52,930 --> 02:06:55,600
Have you seen those things as they have
for Women Where They Get pee outdoors?

4339
02:06:55,990 --> 02:06:57,660
It's like a funnel you put over your box.

4340
02:06:57,700 --> 02:07:00,070
They have that at like
bass pro shops and stuff.

4341
02:07:00,940 --> 02:07:01,721
I've seen it.

4342
02:07:01,721 --> 02:07:01,880
Yeah,

4343
02:07:01,880 --> 02:07:02,600
I'd you can go.

4344
02:07:02,600 --> 02:07:03,433
Yeah,

4345
02:07:03,730 --> 02:07:04,563
I want to try it.

4346
02:07:04,670 --> 02:07:06,520
It has good reviews online.

4347
02:07:06,580 --> 02:07:06,910
Yeah.

4348
02:07:06,910 --> 02:07:10,680
Well the kind of people that
I just thing I just enjoy

4349
02:07:10,970 --> 02:07:12,380
over a pile of leaves.

4350
02:07:12,510 --> 02:07:13,040
Do you know?

4351
02:07:13,040 --> 02:07:13,873
Yeah.

4352
02:07:14,450 --> 02:07:15,280
If you're camping,

4353
02:07:15,280 --> 02:07:16,113
do you camp?

4354
02:07:16,130 --> 02:07:17,000
I've gone camping.

4355
02:07:17,030 --> 02:07:17,863
How many times?

4356
02:07:17,900 --> 02:07:18,680
Twice.

4357
02:07:18,680 --> 02:07:19,513
Did you enjoy it?

4358
02:07:19,670 --> 02:07:21,140
It was so much fun.

4359
02:07:21,230 --> 02:07:21,980
Where'd you go?

4360
02:07:21,980 --> 02:07:22,671
I went in,

4361
02:07:22,671 --> 02:07:23,090
um,

4362
02:07:23,090 --> 02:07:26,000
Florida is silver's silver lake,

4363
02:07:26,001 --> 02:07:26,834
silver springs.

4364
02:07:26,950 --> 02:07:28,300
See Camping in Florida.

4365
02:07:28,301 --> 02:07:31,250
It takes on a totally different meaning
because you could easily run into a meth

4366
02:07:31,251 --> 02:07:34,450
heads are crazy people
out there in the woods.

4367
02:07:34,460 --> 02:07:34,780
Yeah.

4368
02:07:34,780 --> 02:07:35,613
Alligators,

4369
02:07:35,740 --> 02:07:36,573
snakes.

4370
02:07:37,150 --> 02:07:38,560
You're lucky you only went twice.

4371
02:07:39,040 --> 02:07:39,520
I know.

4372
02:07:39,520 --> 02:07:40,930
Well maybe the third time I will.

4373
02:07:41,070 --> 02:07:44,670
That's like going hunting for Ufo is
twice and saying that it was nothing out

4374
02:07:44,671 --> 02:07:45,420
there.

4375
02:07:45,420 --> 02:07:46,253
You never know.

4376
02:07:46,590 --> 02:07:47,320
There's a lot of,

4377
02:07:47,320 --> 02:07:47,540
yeah,

4378
02:07:47,540 --> 02:07:50,840
I was surprised at like everybody just
left all their stuff in the open when

4379
02:07:50,841 --> 02:07:51,500
they ride,

4380
02:07:51,500 --> 02:07:52,730
ride their bikes down the path,

4381
02:07:52,760 --> 02:07:53,091
you know,

4382
02:07:53,091 --> 02:07:56,150
go down to the beach and everybody just
has their stuff and you're just on the

4383
02:07:56,450 --> 02:07:57,283
honor system.

4384
02:07:57,650 --> 02:07:58,190
Yeah.

4385
02:07:58,190 --> 02:07:58,910
You know,

4386
02:07:58,910 --> 02:08:03,910
and like nothing gets stolen and it's
not like it happens right all the time.

4387
02:08:04,170 --> 02:08:05,760
That's our big problem with camp grounds.

4388
02:08:05,920 --> 02:08:06,990
Shiny problem shorts.

4389
02:08:07,010 --> 02:08:07,970
Like lock your shit up.

4390
02:08:08,160 --> 02:08:08,551
Well,

4391
02:08:08,551 --> 02:08:10,470
I mean if you have
anything really valuable,

4392
02:08:10,471 --> 02:08:11,490
you lock it up in your car.

4393
02:08:11,491 --> 02:08:11,911
But yeah,

4394
02:08:11,911 --> 02:08:13,680
people's tents get robbed all the time.

4395
02:08:14,070 --> 02:08:14,820
Oh Damn.

4396
02:08:14,820 --> 02:08:14,971
Well,

4397
02:08:14,971 --> 02:08:15,801
it's just one of those things.

4398
02:08:15,801 --> 02:08:18,930
And it also attracts a lot of
vagrants and a lot of people that are,

4399
02:08:19,440 --> 02:08:19,741
you know,

4400
02:08:19,741 --> 02:08:20,580
they're down on their luck.

4401
02:08:20,581 --> 02:08:21,780
And that's where the sleeping in a tent.

4402
02:08:21,810 --> 02:08:23,610
There's people that are
essentially homeless,

4403
02:08:23,611 --> 02:08:24,444
but they have a tent,

4404
02:08:24,780 --> 02:08:25,141
you know?

4405
02:08:25,141 --> 02:08:29,190
And if you have a cut public
campground and there's a shower there,

4406
02:08:29,260 --> 02:08:32,980
you can kind of get a reservation at a
public campground that's like hard to get

4407
02:08:32,981 --> 02:08:33,101
to.

4408
02:08:33,101 --> 02:08:37,510
Like you take a ferry and then you get a
guy in a jeep picks you up and you know

4409
02:08:37,710 --> 02:08:41,100
you're in trolley and it takes
you down to your camp site.

4410
02:08:41,530 --> 02:08:43,660
Brian ever tell you about
being from Kevin and bean.

4411
02:08:43,960 --> 02:08:45,070
He lives on an island.

4412
02:08:45,490 --> 02:08:47,650
He lives on an island outside of Seattle.

4413
02:08:47,780 --> 02:08:48,130
Mm.

4414
02:08:48,130 --> 02:08:52,450
You can't even get to it unless you take
a ferry guy lives on an island out in

4415
02:08:52,451 --> 02:08:54,310
the middle of the fucking the bay.

4416
02:08:55,240 --> 02:08:55,991
And you know,

4417
02:08:55,991 --> 02:08:57,520
he's kind of in Seattle,

4418
02:08:57,910 --> 02:08:58,421
but he does.

4419
02:08:58,421 --> 02:08:58,601
He ever,

4420
02:08:58,601 --> 02:08:59,434
did.

4421
02:08:59,470 --> 02:09:01,660
You ever know Kevin and being the best?

4422
02:09:01,680 --> 02:09:01,870
They're,

4423
02:09:01,870 --> 02:09:02,501
they're awesome.

4424
02:09:02,501 --> 02:09:03,430
And they're still around.

4425
02:09:03,460 --> 02:09:05,620
They're like one of the last
radio shows is still around,

4426
02:09:06,220 --> 02:09:07,840
but he um,

4427
02:09:07,870 --> 02:09:12,870
he is wired into the La Studio so he
lives in Seattle and Kevin still lives in

4428
02:09:13,961 --> 02:09:16,510
La and the gas come to la when I go,

4429
02:09:16,570 --> 02:09:17,560
when I do the show,

4430
02:09:17,740 --> 02:09:20,320
I do it in studio and um,

4431
02:09:20,860 --> 02:09:22,930
except when I call in
tomorrow I'm calling in,

4432
02:09:23,110 --> 02:09:24,610
but when I do it in studio,

4433
02:09:24,670 --> 02:09:29,050
you sit down there with Kevin and being
is over the loudspeaker and it sounds

4434
02:09:29,051 --> 02:09:29,980
like he's right there with you,

4435
02:09:30,310 --> 02:09:31,120
but you don't see him.

4436
02:09:31,120 --> 02:09:32,230
He's like the eye in the sky.

4437
02:09:32,231 --> 02:09:32,590
He's like,

4438
02:09:32,590 --> 02:09:33,130
God,

4439
02:09:33,130 --> 02:09:36,190
you think they would have it like at
least a Skype system going on so you could

4440
02:09:36,191 --> 02:09:37,030
at least see him?

4441
02:09:37,330 --> 02:09:37,511
No,

4442
02:09:37,511 --> 02:09:39,340
you don't see him see him bed?

4443
02:09:39,590 --> 02:09:39,941
He's,

4444
02:09:39,941 --> 02:09:40,271
well he,

4445
02:09:40,271 --> 02:09:41,260
you can see them.

4446
02:09:41,261 --> 02:09:43,900
They have some sort of a setup where
you could see him on a video camera or

4447
02:09:43,901 --> 02:09:46,030
something like where that Talia delay?

4448
02:09:46,210 --> 02:09:46,600
No,

4449
02:09:46,600 --> 02:09:47,140
no delay.

4450
02:09:47,140 --> 02:09:47,351
No,

4451
02:09:47,351 --> 02:09:48,760
because it's like an ISD n line.

4452
02:09:48,761 --> 02:09:50,660
So the delay is so minuscule knows,

4453
02:09:50,680 --> 02:09:51,513
can't tell.

4454
02:09:51,700 --> 02:09:51,941
No,

4455
02:09:51,941 --> 02:09:52,774
you can't tell.

4456
02:09:53,020 --> 02:09:53,680
Yeah.

4457
02:09:53,680 --> 02:09:56,560
W The delay is like difference
between this and this.

4458
02:09:57,100 --> 02:09:58,150
Like it's so short,

4459
02:09:58,180 --> 02:09:58,661
it's like this,

4460
02:09:58,661 --> 02:09:59,200
this,

4461
02:09:59,200 --> 02:09:59,600
it's like the,

4462
02:09:59,600 --> 02:10:00,880
it's like maybe a half second.

4463
02:10:00,881 --> 02:10:01,714
Not even,

4464
02:10:01,960 --> 02:10:02,231
you know,

4465
02:10:02,231 --> 02:10:03,490
it's like an internet lag.

4466
02:10:03,640 --> 02:10:04,600
So yeah,

4467
02:10:04,750 --> 02:10:05,351
it's like paying,

4468
02:10:05,351 --> 02:10:05,591
yeah.

4469
02:10:05,591 --> 02:10:08,630
So if you're saying
something and you know the,

4470
02:10:08,631 --> 02:10:09,464
the amount of,

4471
02:10:09,640 --> 02:10:12,820
it's not like that critical that what
you're saying has to be like an eighth of

4472
02:10:12,821 --> 02:10:13,720
a second Corker.

4473
02:10:13,810 --> 02:10:15,100
Just whenever it comes out,

4474
02:10:15,101 --> 02:10:17,570
it seems like it's real time so that he,

4475
02:10:17,571 --> 02:10:18,550
he does it from an island,

4476
02:10:18,670 --> 02:10:19,540
but I always wanted like,

4477
02:10:19,570 --> 02:10:20,590
I don't know if I could do that,

4478
02:10:20,591 --> 02:10:20,861
man.

4479
02:10:20,861 --> 02:10:22,090
I don't know if I could live on an island.

4480
02:10:22,091 --> 02:10:23,260
I would kind of weird me out.

4481
02:10:23,290 --> 02:10:23,770
Yeah.

4482
02:10:23,770 --> 02:10:25,570
There's this place in
San Diego that's like,

4483
02:10:25,571 --> 02:10:29,470
that I went to where you take a ferry
over and then it's just like this small

4484
02:10:29,471 --> 02:10:31,120
island and it's a whole community though.

4485
02:10:31,121 --> 02:10:32,560
They have like a little grocery store,

4486
02:10:32,561 --> 02:10:33,660
a little Sushi place,

4487
02:10:34,110 --> 02:10:34,943
dry cleaner,

4488
02:10:35,030 --> 02:10:36,920
but just houses everywhere.

4489
02:10:36,950 --> 02:10:37,490
Uh,

4490
02:10:37,490 --> 02:10:39,620
but it's completely cut off.

4491
02:10:39,621 --> 02:10:41,690
If there's a bad storm
or something like that.

4492
02:10:41,691 --> 02:10:43,100
They can't have the ferry.

4493
02:10:43,220 --> 02:10:45,440
Everyone's stuck or not
stuck on that island.

4494
02:10:45,650 --> 02:10:49,660
There's that island outside of a San
Diego that all the super rich people live.

4495
02:10:49,780 --> 02:10:50,660
That's the island,

4496
02:10:50,661 --> 02:10:50,870
I think.

4497
02:10:50,870 --> 02:10:51,230
Yeah.

4498
02:10:51,230 --> 02:10:52,140
That's like Dick Cheney.

4499
02:10:52,141 --> 02:10:53,620
He's got a house out there and yeah.

4500
02:10:53,660 --> 02:10:53,991
Yeah.

4501
02:10:53,991 --> 02:10:55,400
That's a spooky spot.

4502
02:10:55,430 --> 02:10:55,791
Have you been,

4503
02:10:55,791 --> 02:10:56,461
so you've been to that?

4504
02:10:56,461 --> 02:10:56,811
It's so,

4505
02:10:56,811 --> 02:10:57,620
I've never been,

4506
02:10:57,620 --> 02:10:57,771
oh,

4507
02:10:57,771 --> 02:10:58,401
it's so weird.

4508
02:10:58,401 --> 02:10:59,500
We went there and ate,

4509
02:10:59,660 --> 02:11:00,493
what's it called?

4510
02:11:01,510 --> 02:11:02,610
I think it's core natto out.

4511
02:11:02,640 --> 02:11:03,030
Yes.

4512
02:11:03,030 --> 02:11:03,930
That's exactly what it's called.

4513
02:11:04,340 --> 02:11:04,980
Yeah.

4514
02:11:04,980 --> 02:11:05,311
There was,

4515
02:11:05,311 --> 02:11:05,550
um,

4516
02:11:05,550 --> 02:11:08,640
some sort of a murder mystery
that was going on there.

4517
02:11:08,850 --> 02:11:12,030
There was some unsolved murder in some
really wealthy family that they felt like

4518
02:11:12,031 --> 02:11:13,560
some shenanigans are taking place.

4519
02:11:13,920 --> 02:11:15,000
I can't remember the store.

4520
02:11:15,240 --> 02:11:16,470
And you know the story.

4521
02:11:17,400 --> 02:11:18,100
Do you know about it?

4522
02:11:18,100 --> 02:11:18,933
You know how it goes?

4523
02:11:19,770 --> 02:11:21,570
The wife was Margaret.

4524
02:11:21,630 --> 02:11:22,350
Yeah.

4525
02:11:22,350 --> 02:11:23,010
Yeah.

4526
02:11:23,010 --> 02:11:25,320
There's some shenanigans with the son.

4527
02:11:26,550 --> 02:11:27,720
The son got murdered.

4528
02:11:27,930 --> 02:11:28,763
I don't remember.

4529
02:11:29,370 --> 02:11:29,980
No,

4530
02:11:29,980 --> 02:11:31,070
he's the worst though.

4531
02:11:32,740 --> 02:11:33,100
Murder

4532
02:11:33,100 --> 02:11:34,080
on Coronado island.

4533
02:11:34,081 --> 02:11:34,571
Say murder.

4534
02:11:34,571 --> 02:11:35,404
Mystery.

4535
02:11:35,920 --> 02:11:36,221
Murder.

4536
02:11:36,221 --> 02:11:37,054
Mystery.

4537
02:11:37,770 --> 02:11:38,603
Uh,

4538
02:11:38,970 --> 02:11:43,810
death of Rebecca is how
the cranked up here.

4539
02:11:43,870 --> 02:11:47,830
It was discovered dead July 13th,

4540
02:11:47,830 --> 02:11:48,663
2011.

4541
02:11:49,690 --> 02:11:54,370
She was like the step mom and they
thought that she killed his son.

4542
02:11:54,910 --> 02:11:58,480
And so all of a sudden she goes
missing and she's murdered.

4543
02:11:58,750 --> 02:11:58,901
Oh,

4544
02:11:58,901 --> 02:11:59,734
this is what happened.

4545
02:11:59,770 --> 02:12:03,880
She died two days after this guy's son,

4546
02:12:04,270 --> 02:12:06,850
Max took a fatal fall from a staircase,

4547
02:12:06,851 --> 02:12:09,100
banister in the same beach house.

4548
02:12:09,610 --> 02:12:12,970
The woman was the only adult
present at the time of his fall.

4549
02:12:13,710 --> 02:12:18,340
So she killed his son or she fucked up.

4550
02:12:19,510 --> 02:12:20,343
Um,

4551
02:12:20,680 --> 02:12:24,220
Bill Gore announced September 2nd,

4552
02:12:24,220 --> 02:12:24,221
2011.

4553
02:12:24,221 --> 02:12:25,031
That's a how,

4554
02:12:25,031 --> 02:12:29,440
whose death was a suicide
while the younger or something,

4555
02:12:29,441 --> 02:12:34,441
something was an accident and that
neither was the result of foul play.

4556
02:12:34,710 --> 02:12:36,700
Remember as a host family sued,

4557
02:12:37,240 --> 02:12:38,073
uh,

4558
02:12:38,150 --> 02:12:41,890
Max's parents for $10 million disputing
the contention that her death was

4559
02:12:41,891 --> 02:12:42,580
suicide.

4560
02:12:42,580 --> 02:12:43,413
Huh?

4561
02:12:43,600 --> 02:12:44,470
How'd that settle?

4562
02:12:45,090 --> 02:12:46,540
How'd the lawsuit play out?

4563
02:12:48,790 --> 02:12:52,030
So you can sue someone for something
like civil lawsuits are really tricky.

4564
02:12:52,420 --> 02:12:53,121
It's like where,

4565
02:12:53,121 --> 02:12:53,460
uh,

4566
02:12:53,460 --> 02:12:53,690
oh,

4567
02:12:53,690 --> 02:12:56,740
Jay's like got sued because of,

4568
02:12:56,741 --> 02:12:57,574
uh,

4569
02:12:57,820 --> 02:12:59,260
the dude's family.

4570
02:12:59,320 --> 02:13:00,190
What was his name?

4571
02:13:00,530 --> 02:13:00,920
You know,

4572
02:13:00,920 --> 02:13:01,753
there's a,

4573
02:13:02,230 --> 02:13:05,260
his wife and then the boyfriend Ron gold.

4574
02:13:05,290 --> 02:13:05,951
Ron Goldman.

4575
02:13:05,951 --> 02:13:06,200
Yeah.

4576
02:13:06,200 --> 02:13:08,380
Ron Goldman's family sued and won.

4577
02:13:08,950 --> 02:13:13,570
And that's why he had to like go
bankrupt his Heisman trophy or something.

4578
02:13:13,930 --> 02:13:14,171
Yeah,

4579
02:13:14,171 --> 02:13:15,010
they got his Heisman.

4580
02:13:15,340 --> 02:13:16,240
But who wants that?

4581
02:13:16,660 --> 02:13:17,410
You know,

4582
02:13:17,410 --> 02:13:19,000
try selling that fucking gross.

4583
02:13:21,100 --> 02:13:21,933
This woman,

4584
02:13:22,020 --> 02:13:22,211
no,

4585
02:13:22,211 --> 02:13:23,044
I don't think they know.

4586
02:13:23,290 --> 02:13:26,260
No one was there except the dude and
her and he probably pushed her off the

4587
02:13:26,261 --> 02:13:27,094
fucking side.

4588
02:13:27,100 --> 02:13:30,160
But I was like pitching
show my baby most likely.

4589
02:13:30,450 --> 02:13:31,170
It seems like it.

4590
02:13:31,170 --> 02:13:32,280
She might've killed herself too.

4591
02:13:32,670 --> 02:13:33,960
She might have fucking hated him,

4592
02:13:33,961 --> 02:13:35,760
blaming her for a stupid kid jumping.

4593
02:13:35,761 --> 02:13:36,061
So He's,

4594
02:13:36,061 --> 02:13:36,481
she's like,

4595
02:13:36,481 --> 02:13:36,991
you know what pitch?

4596
02:13:36,991 --> 02:13:37,860
I'm gonna get you in trouble.

4597
02:13:38,100 --> 02:13:38,960
I'm thinking to myself,

4598
02:13:39,120 --> 02:13:40,290
it was a huge house,

4599
02:13:40,291 --> 02:13:40,830
so he,

4600
02:13:40,830 --> 02:13:45,150
the boy like could've just fallen off
a staircase and just died accidentally.

4601
02:13:45,180 --> 02:13:46,710
She's probably wasn't paying attention.

4602
02:13:46,711 --> 02:13:47,430
That's probably why.

4603
02:13:47,430 --> 02:13:48,510
If someone wanted to kill her,

4604
02:13:48,511 --> 02:13:49,590
that's why they would want to kill her.

4605
02:13:49,591 --> 02:13:51,160
Just they were furious that
you weren't paying attention.

4606
02:13:51,170 --> 02:13:52,410
You got to watch two year olds,

4607
02:13:52,411 --> 02:13:54,840
like you gotta be right
there with them all the time.

4608
02:13:55,560 --> 02:13:56,280
He was six,

4609
02:13:56,280 --> 02:13:57,270
he was six it said.

4610
02:13:57,720 --> 02:13:58,380
Is that what it says?

4611
02:13:58,380 --> 02:13:58,861
What do I think?

4612
02:13:58,861 --> 02:13:59,694
It's two,

4613
02:14:00,060 --> 02:14:00,690
six.

4614
02:14:00,690 --> 02:14:01,180
Yeah.

4615
02:14:01,180 --> 02:14:01,610
He,

4616
02:14:01,610 --> 02:14:01,831
you know,

4617
02:14:01,831 --> 02:14:02,551
even six year olds,

4618
02:14:02,551 --> 02:14:02,681
they,

4619
02:14:02,681 --> 02:14:02,931
they,

4620
02:14:02,931 --> 02:14:03,750
they actually,

4621
02:14:03,750 --> 02:14:05,970
sometimes you have to watch them even
more because they get real cocky.

4622
02:14:05,971 --> 02:14:08,730
Six year olds in a big mansion
with a banister staircase.

4623
02:14:09,210 --> 02:14:09,541
Well,

4624
02:14:09,541 --> 02:14:10,440
if you do,

4625
02:14:10,470 --> 02:14:12,450
you have to fucking pay attention to them.

4626
02:14:12,480 --> 02:14:12,990
I mean,

4627
02:14:12,990 --> 02:14:13,531
who knows?

4628
02:14:13,531 --> 02:14:14,580
But who knows what happened.

4629
02:14:14,610 --> 02:14:14,821
You know,

4630
02:14:14,821 --> 02:14:16,080
we don't know what happened with the kid.

4631
02:14:16,081 --> 02:14:17,100
We don't know what happened to her.

4632
02:14:17,110 --> 02:14:19,020
There might've been some
weird shit with him or her.

4633
02:14:21,050 --> 02:14:21,650
Okay.

4634
02:14:21,650 --> 02:14:21,981
Okay.

4635
02:14:21,981 --> 02:14:26,981
What does it say in July 13 2011 a nude
body of Xy who was found bound and hang

4636
02:14:28,671 --> 02:14:31,700
from a balcony at the famous
speckled mansion Coronado.

4637
02:14:31,910 --> 02:14:35,900
A cryptic message written in black paint
was found just outside the second story

4638
02:14:35,901 --> 02:14:36,531
room in the house.

4639
02:14:36,531 --> 02:14:37,190
Which red?

4640
02:14:37,190 --> 02:14:38,330
She saved him.

4641
02:14:38,540 --> 02:14:39,650
Can you save her?

4642
02:14:40,010 --> 02:14:40,843
What?

4643
02:14:41,240 --> 02:14:42,320
I'm confused.

4644
02:14:43,160 --> 02:14:44,210
She can wait a minute.

4645
02:14:44,270 --> 02:14:45,650
I thought she fell.

4646
02:14:49,690 --> 02:14:50,410
Okay.

4647
02:14:50,410 --> 02:14:51,310
Amended Lawsuit.

4648
02:14:51,311 --> 02:14:53,710
Rebecca is a how beaten,

4649
02:14:53,711 --> 02:14:56,080
strangled and pushed off a balcony.

4650
02:14:56,530 --> 02:14:57,760
She was found dead so that,

4651
02:14:57,790 --> 02:14:58,061
oh,

4652
02:14:58,061 --> 02:14:58,331
okay.

4653
02:14:58,331 --> 02:15:00,820
This is a totally different story.

4654
02:15:00,821 --> 02:15:02,380
This was from last year.

4655
02:15:02,950 --> 02:15:03,640
Oh,

4656
02:15:03,640 --> 02:15:05,020
so now there,

4657
02:15:05,200 --> 02:15:06,460
so it's still going on.

4658
02:15:07,030 --> 02:15:07,470
Whoa.

4659
02:15:07,470 --> 02:15:08,460
Scroll down here.

4660
02:15:08,960 --> 02:15:10,660
$10 million claiming,

4661
02:15:10,740 --> 02:15:11,480
um,

4662
02:15:11,480 --> 02:15:13,320
lawsuits claiming Rebecca,

4663
02:15:13,420 --> 02:15:16,330
how was this is what homes blowing?

4664
02:15:16,331 --> 02:15:16,901
I'm saying it weird.

4665
02:15:16,901 --> 02:15:18,220
Z A h.

4666
02:15:18,250 --> 02:15:21,100
A U I think you spelled that.

4667
02:15:21,160 --> 02:15:22,180
I think you pronounce that.

4668
02:15:22,720 --> 02:15:27,720
So how so how's death was
a murder and not a suicide?

4669
02:15:28,030 --> 02:15:30,970
It's been amended to allege new details.

4670
02:15:31,330 --> 02:15:36,330
About three people conspired to kill her
being gay and strangling her with the

4671
02:15:36,401 --> 02:15:36,971
autopsy.

4672
02:15:36,971 --> 02:15:37,770
She,

4673
02:15:37,770 --> 02:15:39,370
it couldn't have been a suicide.

4674
02:15:39,820 --> 02:15:40,653
Really.

4675
02:15:40,860 --> 02:15:42,520
They found marks on her body.

4676
02:15:44,260 --> 02:15:45,220
Jesus Christ.

4677
02:15:46,830 --> 02:15:47,663
Okay,

4678
02:15:48,940 --> 02:15:50,680
well who knows,

4679
02:15:50,770 --> 02:15:51,490
who knows?

4680
02:15:51,490 --> 02:15:52,600
She might have been evil.

4681
02:15:52,601 --> 02:15:53,920
She might've killed the kid.

4682
02:15:54,370 --> 02:15:57,190
They might have killed her accident.

4683
02:15:57,850 --> 02:15:58,361
I don't know.

4684
02:15:58,361 --> 02:16:00,310
But I mean if they found her hanging,

4685
02:16:00,900 --> 02:16:02,440
if they really did find her hanging,

4686
02:16:02,441 --> 02:16:03,340
like it says there,

4687
02:16:03,610 --> 02:16:07,600
the document goes on to claim that the
trios trucks out on the head multiple

4688
02:16:07,601 --> 02:16:07,871
times,

4689
02:16:07,871 --> 02:16:10,000
the blunt instrument
physically restrained,

4690
02:16:10,001 --> 02:16:10,930
her gagged her,

4691
02:16:11,050 --> 02:16:15,040
bound her and strangled her to the
point of unconsciousness or death.

4692
02:16:17,180 --> 02:16:18,013
Huh?

4693
02:16:19,030 --> 02:16:19,810
I Dunno,

4694
02:16:19,810 --> 02:16:20,710
I don't even want to know.

4695
02:16:20,880 --> 02:16:24,760
It's creepy from a lawsuit that this is
all coming from to not like an official

4696
02:16:25,150 --> 02:16:25,900
police ruling.

4697
02:16:25,900 --> 02:16:26,350
Right.

4698
02:16:26,350 --> 02:16:27,850
So this is just their claims.

4699
02:16:28,210 --> 02:16:29,043
Is that what it is?

4700
02:16:29,440 --> 02:16:30,450
I think that's what this project,

4701
02:16:30,470 --> 02:16:32,040
I know what opened again,

4702
02:16:32,440 --> 02:16:35,380
probably some people that at one
point in time are madly in love.

4703
02:16:35,590 --> 02:16:36,520
They loved each other,

4704
02:16:36,521 --> 02:16:36,941
asked her,

4705
02:16:36,941 --> 02:16:38,980
they wanted to be together
forever and ever and ever.

4706
02:16:38,981 --> 02:16:39,731
I love you.

4707
02:16:39,731 --> 02:16:40,630
I love you.

4708
02:16:40,631 --> 02:16:41,464
I hug you.

4709
02:16:41,730 --> 02:16:45,070
How do you know who's who's going to kill?

4710
02:16:45,071 --> 02:16:45,850
You know what I mean?

4711
02:16:45,850 --> 02:16:47,380
Like these people,

4712
02:16:47,650 --> 02:16:48,370
they,

4713
02:16:48,370 --> 02:16:49,180
they weren't,

4714
02:16:49,180 --> 02:16:50,590
they didn't pick up on the red flags.

4715
02:16:50,591 --> 02:16:51,850
If there were any,

4716
02:16:52,480 --> 02:16:52,990
well,

4717
02:16:52,990 --> 02:16:57,160
there might be no indication up
until the point where that kid died.

4718
02:16:57,370 --> 02:16:57,731
I mean,

4719
02:16:57,731 --> 02:17:01,090
the kid dying might've been
like this fucking dumb bitch.

4720
02:17:01,360 --> 02:17:01,631
You know,

4721
02:17:01,631 --> 02:17:04,330
I might've been like the straw
that broke the camel's back.

4722
02:17:04,540 --> 02:17:05,021
I mean,

4723
02:17:05,021 --> 02:17:05,071
the,

4724
02:17:05,071 --> 02:17:06,370
if they did murder her,

4725
02:17:06,580 --> 02:17:08,320
that might be what or who knows?

4726
02:17:08,321 --> 02:17:09,550
She might be evil.

4727
02:17:09,700 --> 02:17:09,971
I mean,

4728
02:17:09,971 --> 02:17:13,320
she might've been just a horrible person
and they might have hated her already.

4729
02:17:13,330 --> 02:17:14,650
And then when she killed the kid,

4730
02:17:14,651 --> 02:17:15,640
she might have pushed the kid.

4731
02:17:15,641 --> 02:17:16,474
Who knows?

4732
02:17:16,570 --> 02:17:17,740
People are assholes.

4733
02:17:17,980 --> 02:17:19,960
There's a lot of creepy fucks
out there in this world.

4734
02:17:20,050 --> 02:17:22,350
Maybe she kills him
that true kind of like,

4735
02:17:22,680 --> 02:17:23,011
you know,

4736
02:17:23,011 --> 02:17:23,280
you,

4737
02:17:23,280 --> 02:17:24,730
you would think that she didn't,

4738
02:17:24,750 --> 02:17:26,640
I would like to think it was an accident.

4739
02:17:26,730 --> 02:17:26,971
Yeah.

4740
02:17:26,971 --> 02:17:28,560
I would like to think that
both of them were an accident.

4741
02:17:28,630 --> 02:17:28,990
You,

4742
02:17:28,990 --> 02:17:30,750
the civil suit is just frivolous,

4743
02:17:31,670 --> 02:17:33,620
but you never know.

4744
02:17:33,810 --> 02:17:34,061
Of course.

4745
02:17:34,061 --> 02:17:34,560
You never know.

4746
02:17:34,560 --> 02:17:35,500
You were talking about,

4747
02:17:35,530 --> 02:17:35,801
you know,

4748
02:17:35,801 --> 02:17:37,990
taking care of a two year old and Jamie,

4749
02:17:37,991 --> 02:17:39,910
I just emailed you a video.

4750
02:17:39,911 --> 02:17:43,630
There's this video that somebody posted
last night and it's one of the most we

4751
02:17:43,631 --> 02:17:44,260
saw already,

4752
02:17:44,260 --> 02:17:44,400
I,

4753
02:17:44,400 --> 02:17:45,520
and Josh it onto here.

4754
02:17:45,521 --> 02:17:47,160
I don't want to know if
we should show it on here.

4755
02:17:47,340 --> 02:17:48,670
What the escalator,

4756
02:17:48,800 --> 02:17:48,930
no,

4757
02:17:48,930 --> 02:17:49,763
no,

4758
02:17:50,150 --> 02:17:50,331
no.

4759
02:17:50,331 --> 02:17:51,250
I just emailed you,

4760
02:17:51,270 --> 02:17:52,090
uh,

4761
02:17:52,090 --> 02:17:52,810
somebody,

4762
02:17:52,810 --> 02:17:53,350
uh,

4763
02:17:53,350 --> 02:17:56,560
somebody put a posted this last night
and it's one of these videos I had

4764
02:17:56,950 --> 02:18:01,120
something to do about a kid in a little
kid in a swimming pool and this little

4765
02:18:01,121 --> 02:18:02,650
kid falls in the swimming pool,

4766
02:18:02,680 --> 02:18:04,000
but it has been trained,

4767
02:18:04,450 --> 02:18:05,283
uh,

4768
02:18:05,590 --> 02:18:05,981
to,

4769
02:18:05,981 --> 02:18:06,370
uh,

4770
02:18:06,370 --> 02:18:07,150
survive.

4771
02:18:07,150 --> 02:18:09,670
And this kid is like a
baby can't even talk.

4772
02:18:09,940 --> 02:18:10,351
And so it's,

4773
02:18:10,351 --> 02:18:11,440
it shows this little baby.

4774
02:18:11,441 --> 02:18:12,101
And at first you're like,

4775
02:18:12,101 --> 02:18:13,600
what the fuck is going on?

4776
02:18:13,900 --> 02:18:18,330
This baby falls in the pool and then the
baby just learned how to float and just

4777
02:18:18,340 --> 02:18:22,750
sitting there going and it is
the creepiest coolest video.

4778
02:18:22,920 --> 02:18:23,030
Oh,

4779
02:18:23,030 --> 02:18:24,190
babies are really fat.

4780
02:18:24,220 --> 02:18:25,360
They can float pretty good.

4781
02:18:25,400 --> 02:18:26,020
Yeah.

4782
02:18:26,020 --> 02:18:26,540
Awesome.

4783
02:18:26,540 --> 02:18:27,260
It didn't pan out.

4784
02:18:27,260 --> 02:18:27,500
Yeah.

4785
02:18:27,500 --> 02:18:28,480
But when you see this video,

4786
02:18:28,481 --> 02:18:31,300
it's one of the most interesting
videos to watch because it's,

4787
02:18:31,360 --> 02:18:35,170
it's something you don't want to see
mixed with the baby knowing what it's

4788
02:18:35,171 --> 02:18:35,800
doing.

4789
02:18:35,800 --> 02:18:38,440
So it has this really uneasy feel to it.

4790
02:18:38,620 --> 02:18:41,890
Here's the baby walking out
and has great sound on it also.

4791
02:18:41,891 --> 02:18:42,550
If,

4792
02:18:42,550 --> 02:18:43,990
um,

4793
02:18:44,020 --> 02:18:44,950
but it's uh,

4794
02:18:45,160 --> 02:18:46,270
so they did this on purpose.

4795
02:18:46,271 --> 02:18:48,970
They made this video on purpose
just to show that the baby can do,

4796
02:18:49,000 --> 02:18:49,151
yeah,

4797
02:18:49,151 --> 02:18:50,170
I can show this baby.

4798
02:18:50,171 --> 02:18:51,490
He's a baby now.

4799
02:18:51,491 --> 02:18:53,410
This is not even a two year old watch.

4800
02:18:53,411 --> 02:18:54,820
This is a little tiny toddler.

4801
02:18:55,270 --> 02:18:57,250
And who's recording this?

4802
02:18:57,310 --> 02:18:58,440
There's the,

4803
02:18:58,480 --> 02:19:00,850
the dads are recording this and watch,

4804
02:19:00,910 --> 02:19:02,500
this is where the baby falls in.

4805
02:19:03,800 --> 02:19:04,240
Okay.

4806
02:19:04,240 --> 02:19:05,330
Like this baby's done this

4807
02:19:05,400 --> 02:19:06,070
before the baby,

4808
02:19:06,070 --> 02:19:06,340
right?

4809
02:19:06,340 --> 02:19:06,630
Right.

4810
02:19:06,630 --> 02:19:07,610
Jumped in the water

4811
02:19:07,710 --> 02:19:08,311
kicks.

4812
02:19:08,311 --> 02:19:09,330
Wow.

4813
02:19:09,480 --> 02:19:11,100
Amazing flopping around.

4814
02:19:11,340 --> 02:19:13,470
And then it's up to the
surface and then watch.

4815
02:19:15,140 --> 02:19:15,973
Just relaxing.

4816
02:19:16,610 --> 02:19:17,070
I know.

4817
02:19:17,070 --> 02:19:17,700
It's beautiful.

4818
02:19:17,700 --> 02:19:17,751
Oh,

4819
02:19:17,751 --> 02:19:18,121
wait a minute.

4820
02:19:18,121 --> 02:19:20,490
Is this a suit he's
wearing is a special suit?

4821
02:19:21,090 --> 02:19:21,331
No,

4822
02:19:21,331 --> 02:19:22,830
I think this is just this little pajamas.

4823
02:19:23,310 --> 02:19:23,940
Are you sure?

4824
02:19:23,940 --> 02:19:24,300
But I don't,

4825
02:19:24,300 --> 02:19:24,511
you know,

4826
02:19:24,511 --> 02:19:25,344
I have no idea.

4827
02:19:27,500 --> 02:19:28,010
Wow.

4828
02:19:28,010 --> 02:19:28,843
Let me start.

4829
02:19:28,940 --> 02:19:30,560
It starts actually talking.

4830
02:19:33,300 --> 02:19:34,131
It's Kinda fucked it.

4831
02:19:34,131 --> 02:19:35,660
They leave them there
like this for this long.

4832
02:19:36,440 --> 02:19:37,310
I get the video,

4833
02:19:37,311 --> 02:19:37,671
dude.

4834
02:19:37,671 --> 02:19:39,590
Go of your fucking kid.

4835
02:19:40,230 --> 02:19:40,821
And guess what?

4836
02:19:40,821 --> 02:19:43,070
This goes on for another minute.

4837
02:19:45,170 --> 02:19:46,003
Cut it off.

4838
02:19:46,170 --> 02:19:47,030
If you cut to the very end,

4839
02:19:47,031 --> 02:19:48,330
you could see where the bay,

4840
02:19:48,400 --> 02:19:49,970
look how it's really cute baby.

4841
02:19:49,971 --> 02:19:53,540
When the guy grabs it at
the very end of the video.

4842
02:19:53,970 --> 02:19:54,540
Uh,

4843
02:19:54,540 --> 02:19:55,120
let's see.

4844
02:19:55,120 --> 02:19:58,460
And it's just happy as can be.

4845
02:19:58,480 --> 02:19:59,313
He's laughing.

4846
02:20:00,320 --> 02:20:01,790
I said that was interesting and creepy,

4847
02:20:01,880 --> 02:20:02,840
but it is interesting.

4848
02:20:02,870 --> 02:20:04,880
I wonder if it's a suit or if it's a,

4849
02:20:04,881 --> 02:20:07,820
they just taught the kid the line is
back and they just naturally float.

4850
02:20:08,030 --> 02:20:09,500
I think a lot of is probably they panic,

4851
02:20:09,501 --> 02:20:10,334
you know,

4852
02:20:10,750 --> 02:20:12,110
they don't even need a bathing suit.

4853
02:20:13,780 --> 02:20:15,390
It was like awesome.

4854
02:20:16,600 --> 02:20:17,030
Yeah.

4855
02:20:17,030 --> 02:20:19,220
Babies and pools are vert
very fucking dangerous.

4856
02:20:19,220 --> 02:20:22,160
That's one of the most dangerous things
when you have children as worrying about

4857
02:20:22,161 --> 02:20:23,360
them falling into a pool.

4858
02:20:23,570 --> 02:20:25,490
One of a Dhimmi Moore's kids,

4859
02:20:25,491 --> 02:20:27,800
a kid drowned at her party the other day.

4860
02:20:27,950 --> 02:20:29,390
Apparently Dimmy more has,

4861
02:20:29,480 --> 02:20:34,050
you know Bruce Willis is
kids and they are rangers.

4862
02:20:34,370 --> 02:20:35,630
When dummies out of town,

4863
02:20:35,631 --> 02:20:38,060
they just have fucking
rage or is every night

4864
02:20:41,270 --> 02:20:42,500
and somebody will end up dead.

4865
02:20:43,350 --> 02:20:45,770
Appboy wound up dead
face down in the pool.

4866
02:20:45,771 --> 02:20:47,480
I believe he was 21 nope.

4867
02:20:47,540 --> 02:20:48,373
Some boy,

4868
02:20:48,640 --> 02:20:49,473
some did.

4869
02:20:49,550 --> 02:20:51,560
Ran Out of calm high on meth.

4870
02:20:51,561 --> 02:20:52,400
Fell into the pool.

4871
02:20:53,600 --> 02:20:54,560
Fucking dead.

4872
02:20:54,561 --> 02:20:55,610
I'm sorry if it was your son.

4873
02:20:55,611 --> 02:20:56,860
I don't mean just,

4874
02:20:56,880 --> 02:20:57,450
you know,

4875
02:20:57,450 --> 02:20:58,283
little things man,

4876
02:20:59,870 --> 02:21:04,010
how insensitive they become a non did
become a note and they don't become a real

4877
02:21:04,011 --> 02:21:04,371
person,

4878
02:21:04,371 --> 02:21:05,100
you know?

4879
02:21:05,100 --> 02:21:05,933
Oh God.

4880
02:21:06,680 --> 02:21:07,370
Yeah,

4881
02:21:07,370 --> 02:21:08,203
totally.

4882
02:21:08,480 --> 02:21:09,800
That's a scary shit thing,

4883
02:21:09,801 --> 02:21:10,071
man.

4884
02:21:10,071 --> 02:21:13,880
Leave your kids alone at home and one
of their friends dies and you're fucking

4885
02:21:13,881 --> 02:21:14,510
pool like,

4886
02:21:14,510 --> 02:21:17,510
oh Christ alcohol and Waterman.

4887
02:21:17,570 --> 02:21:18,171
Super,

4888
02:21:18,171 --> 02:21:19,280
super dangerous.

4889
02:21:19,310 --> 02:21:19,581
Yeah.

4890
02:21:19,581 --> 02:21:22,490
I mean look at that girl who passed out
in the highway that we watched that one

4891
02:21:22,491 --> 02:21:22,761
time.

4892
02:21:22,761 --> 02:21:23,594
The video.

4893
02:21:23,740 --> 02:21:25,550
Now imagine somebody
just like hanging out,

4894
02:21:25,551 --> 02:21:25,990
like,

4895
02:21:25,990 --> 02:21:26,340
you know,

4896
02:21:26,340 --> 02:21:28,940
drinking beer and just
slips and falls asleep.

4897
02:21:28,941 --> 02:21:29,660
And next thing you know,

4898
02:21:29,660 --> 02:21:29,871
you know,

4899
02:21:29,871 --> 02:21:31,790
whenever I think about alcohol and pools,

4900
02:21:31,791 --> 02:21:34,190
you know what to think about those
images from the Bryan singer,

4901
02:21:34,191 --> 02:21:38,280
gay parties that he used to have with the
red pool water and the 50,000 dudes in

4902
02:21:38,281 --> 02:21:39,290
their underwear in the pool.

4903
02:21:39,320 --> 02:21:39,501
That's,

4904
02:21:39,501 --> 02:21:39,700
I,

4905
02:21:39,700 --> 02:21:42,020
I am stuck thinking about that forever.

4906
02:21:42,290 --> 02:21:43,580
Whenever I think about the fact that,

4907
02:21:43,590 --> 02:21:43,731
you know,

4908
02:21:43,731 --> 02:21:45,800
like whenever someone
says like Pool Party,

4909
02:21:45,801 --> 02:21:47,060
people drunk at the pool.

4910
02:21:47,061 --> 02:21:48,680
I think of that image cause it was,

4911
02:21:48,681 --> 02:21:49,514
have you ever seen it?

4912
02:21:49,730 --> 02:21:50,660
It's the craziest shit ever.

4913
02:21:51,050 --> 02:21:52,150
Bryan singer who uh,

4914
02:21:52,160 --> 02:21:53,510
the guy who will look at that.

4915
02:21:53,570 --> 02:21:55,010
He's the guy who directed,

4916
02:21:55,820 --> 02:21:56,211
no,

4917
02:21:56,211 --> 02:21:59,330
that's just lights his
red lights in the water.

4918
02:21:59,600 --> 02:22:01,090
The guy who directed the x men,

4919
02:22:01,490 --> 02:22:02,181
he's a gay dude,

4920
02:22:02,181 --> 02:22:03,014
likes to party.

4921
02:22:03,230 --> 02:22:05,720
And so he has these
parties with all these,

4922
02:22:05,721 --> 02:22:06,050
uh,

4923
02:22:06,050 --> 02:22:09,740
young studs and twinks
and they just fill a pool.

4924
02:22:10,240 --> 02:22:11,001
Not from rip to,

4925
02:22:11,001 --> 02:22:11,421
yeah.

4926
02:22:11,421 --> 02:22:14,360
You already talked about
when you couldn't wait.

4927
02:22:14,540 --> 02:22:15,373
Could you

4928
02:22:16,720 --> 02:22:17,051
look at that?

4929
02:22:17,051 --> 02:22:18,980
That everybody drink beet juice,

4930
02:22:19,520 --> 02:22:20,353
gay suit.

4931
02:22:24,170 --> 02:22:25,040
But that's what I think about.

4932
02:22:25,260 --> 02:22:26,160
I think about pools

4933
02:22:26,160 --> 02:22:26,881
and alcohol.

4934
02:22:26,881 --> 02:22:29,820
I think this the out of control scenario.

4935
02:22:29,830 --> 02:22:30,670
Yeah.

4936
02:22:31,140 --> 02:22:31,500
Nah,

4937
02:22:31,500 --> 02:22:31,920
Nah,

4938
02:22:31,920 --> 02:22:32,753
Nah.

4939
02:22:33,480 --> 02:22:35,400
That's what was going on
to Jimmy Moore's house.

4940
02:22:35,610 --> 02:22:37,080
The Lyft driver last night.

4941
02:22:37,081 --> 02:22:41,370
Joe Saw you 20 years ago and you said
something to an audience member that he

4942
02:22:41,371 --> 02:22:45,330
says that he says to himself every
single day since you've seen you,

4943
02:22:45,420 --> 02:22:46,200
what does loan,

4944
02:22:46,200 --> 02:22:47,550
it's because you were,

4945
02:22:47,551 --> 02:22:50,130
there was some woman heckler and you said,

4946
02:22:50,400 --> 02:22:52,710
where did you learn to whisper a sawmill?

4947
02:22:53,450 --> 02:22:54,283
That's a hack line.

4948
02:22:56,540 --> 02:22:57,373
That's a Hagwon

4949
02:22:57,710 --> 02:22:58,820
he says he uses that,

4950
02:22:58,821 --> 02:22:59,654
all of this is he the,

4951
02:22:59,660 --> 02:23:01,400
he he thinks about it every day.

4952
02:23:01,401 --> 02:23:02,670
I need he and uh,

4953
02:23:03,080 --> 02:23:03,330
yeah,

4954
02:23:03,330 --> 02:23:03,950
people that's,

4955
02:23:03,950 --> 02:23:04,820
that's a hack line.

4956
02:23:04,910 --> 02:23:06,320
That's a like a standard,

4957
02:23:06,321 --> 02:23:07,220
like a stock line.

4958
02:23:07,240 --> 02:23:08,900
Where'd you learn to lose per helicopter?

4959
02:23:09,140 --> 02:23:09,973
That's another one.

4960
02:23:10,190 --> 02:23:11,180
What'd you weren't doing this for?

4961
02:23:11,181 --> 02:23:11,980
A,

4962
02:23:11,980 --> 02:23:13,250
you know a warzone?

4963
02:23:14,180 --> 02:23:14,630
Yeah,

4964
02:23:14,630 --> 02:23:16,040
it's hack at it.

4965
02:23:16,041 --> 02:23:16,640
Write it down.

4966
02:23:16,640 --> 02:23:17,560
Cause he just also,

4967
02:23:17,810 --> 02:23:21,380
there was a guy named Brent that worked
at the comedy store and he said that him

4968
02:23:21,381 --> 02:23:22,214
and uh,

4969
02:23:22,430 --> 02:23:26,720
this guy named Brent and I lives in Vegas
and a dom Barris all went to a strip

4970
02:23:26,721 --> 02:23:27,554
club once.

4971
02:23:27,620 --> 02:23:29,180
He says it was the most insane I'd ever,

4972
02:23:29,181 --> 02:23:29,931
cause don was,

4973
02:23:29,931 --> 02:23:31,870
Don was just screaming at all this.

4974
02:23:34,350 --> 02:23:36,380
I can see Ferris doing his ass

4975
02:23:36,750 --> 02:23:37,101
to this.

4976
02:23:37,101 --> 02:23:38,390
Trippers yeah,

4977
02:23:38,391 --> 02:23:39,920
Don Barris is never,

4978
02:23:39,950 --> 02:23:42,680
that's another thing about the comedy
store that's amazing is the late night

4979
02:23:42,681 --> 02:23:43,610
sets by Brodie,

4980
02:23:43,611 --> 02:23:45,140
Brian Holtzman and dawn Barris.

4981
02:23:45,141 --> 02:23:46,100
Those are staples,

4982
02:23:46,480 --> 02:23:47,280
the staples.

4983
02:23:47,280 --> 02:23:47,550
Dot.

4984
02:23:47,550 --> 02:23:49,650
Barry's got mad at me one night for what?

4985
02:23:49,800 --> 02:23:51,120
I forgot what happened.

4986
02:23:51,121 --> 02:23:54,000
He brought me on stage on his late show.

4987
02:23:54,390 --> 02:23:57,930
Dong or Ding Dong show
or was it a regular show?

4988
02:23:58,080 --> 02:23:59,130
It was just a regular show.

4989
02:23:59,131 --> 02:24:00,270
He was just the last one.

4990
02:24:00,290 --> 02:24:00,790
Okay.

4991
02:24:00,790 --> 02:24:01,920
And he brought you on stage?

4992
02:24:01,950 --> 02:24:03,360
He brought me on stage.

4993
02:24:03,390 --> 02:24:04,680
Cause you were after the show,

4994
02:24:04,681 --> 02:24:05,430
is that what it was?

4995
02:24:05,430 --> 02:24:05,671
No,

4996
02:24:05,671 --> 02:24:05,820
no,

4997
02:24:05,820 --> 02:24:05,971
no.

4998
02:24:05,971 --> 02:24:10,140
I was just hanging out and there
were like four people there.

4999
02:24:10,190 --> 02:24:10,471
Right.

5000
02:24:10,471 --> 02:24:11,160
You know what I mean?

5001
02:24:11,160 --> 02:24:13,290
And he brought me on stage and was like,

5002
02:24:13,291 --> 02:24:13,681
what do you do?

5003
02:24:13,681 --> 02:24:13,981
I was like,

5004
02:24:13,981 --> 02:24:14,730
I'm a comedian.

5005
02:24:14,730 --> 02:24:15,061
You know?

5006
02:24:15,061 --> 02:24:15,780
Like that's what I had.

5007
02:24:15,780 --> 02:24:19,170
That's how I met Don Barris
is he brought me on stage.

5008
02:24:19,230 --> 02:24:20,100
And how did he get mad at you?

5009
02:24:20,580 --> 02:24:22,230
I don't remember what happened,

5010
02:24:22,231 --> 02:24:23,064
but

5011
02:24:24,040 --> 02:24:24,873
I dunno.

5012
02:24:24,900 --> 02:24:25,733
People were like,

5013
02:24:25,890 --> 02:24:27,600
people who are like scared for me.

5014
02:24:28,080 --> 02:24:28,950
People were scared for you?

5015
02:24:28,980 --> 02:24:29,161
Well,

5016
02:24:29,161 --> 02:24:30,560
I guarantee you who's playing.

5017
02:24:30,600 --> 02:24:30,721
Yeah,

5018
02:24:30,721 --> 02:24:31,630
he was doing Don Baer.

5019
02:24:31,680 --> 02:24:32,690
He does dom Barris.

5020
02:24:32,710 --> 02:24:33,130
Right?

5021
02:24:33,130 --> 02:24:33,570
That's fine.

5022
02:24:33,570 --> 02:24:34,381
That's what he does.

5023
02:24:34,381 --> 02:24:34,740
Yeah.

5024
02:24:34,740 --> 02:24:35,573
He starts screaming.

5025
02:24:36,180 --> 02:24:37,013
He's not mad at all.

5026
02:24:37,020 --> 02:24:37,501
I know.

5027
02:24:37,501 --> 02:24:38,101
And I said,

5028
02:24:38,101 --> 02:24:38,251
no,

5029
02:24:38,251 --> 02:24:39,250
he's just kidding.

5030
02:24:39,270 --> 02:24:39,480
Yeah.

5031
02:24:39,480 --> 02:24:39,901
You know?

5032
02:24:39,901 --> 02:24:40,560
And they're like,

5033
02:24:40,560 --> 02:24:41,393
no,

5034
02:24:42,240 --> 02:24:43,440
that was too crazy.

5035
02:24:43,500 --> 02:24:44,760
Who are the people that
said it was too crazy?

5036
02:24:44,761 --> 02:24:45,271
I don't remember.

5037
02:24:45,271 --> 02:24:46,400
It was stop hanging out with them.

5038
02:24:46,401 --> 02:24:47,940
It was like five years ago.

5039
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:48,301
Yeah.

5040
02:24:48,301 --> 02:24:49,170
You need new friends.

5041
02:24:49,470 --> 02:24:50,071
They're idiots.

5042
02:24:50,071 --> 02:24:50,371
Done.

5043
02:24:50,371 --> 02:24:50,671
But he's,

5044
02:24:50,671 --> 02:24:52,200
he might've been audience members.

5045
02:24:52,201 --> 02:24:52,801
You know,

5046
02:24:52,801 --> 02:24:54,210
they always fall for it.

5047
02:24:54,510 --> 02:24:54,661
Well,

5048
02:24:54,661 --> 02:24:55,770
that if you don't know,

5049
02:24:55,771 --> 02:24:57,630
like people used to think
that Brody was serious.

5050
02:24:57,631 --> 02:24:59,370
Like people who've never met Brody before.

5051
02:24:59,371 --> 02:24:59,790
Like,

5052
02:24:59,790 --> 02:25:02,880
I have a bunch of friends that saw
Brody for the first time and went like,

5053
02:25:02,910 --> 02:25:03,271
oh my God,

5054
02:25:03,271 --> 02:25:04,020
this guy's terrible.

5055
02:25:04,020 --> 02:25:05,970
And then they see him
five times and they go,

5056
02:25:06,030 --> 02:25:06,181
oh,

5057
02:25:06,181 --> 02:25:06,950
he's amazing.

5058
02:25:06,950 --> 02:25:07,590
I get,

5059
02:25:07,590 --> 02:25:09,320
he's my favorite comedian now learning

5060
02:25:09,320 --> 02:25:09,680
curve.

5061
02:25:09,680 --> 02:25:12,680
That's exactly when I first met him was
that the man show when I went to go see

5062
02:25:12,681 --> 02:25:14,110
man show a w uh,

5063
02:25:14,270 --> 02:25:19,270
with you and I was in the audience for
like two episodes with horse flesh and he

5064
02:25:19,611 --> 02:25:21,320
would scream at the audience,

5065
02:25:21,321 --> 02:25:21,531
you know,

5066
02:25:21,531 --> 02:25:22,161
he was the audience,

5067
02:25:22,161 --> 02:25:22,960
warm up guy.

5068
02:25:22,960 --> 02:25:24,100
But if you didn't know who

5069
02:25:24,100 --> 02:25:24,461
he was,

5070
02:25:24,461 --> 02:25:25,780
and at the time I was just like,

5071
02:25:25,990 --> 02:25:27,220
this guy's making this clap.

5072
02:25:27,221 --> 02:25:28,120
He's yelling at us.

5073
02:25:28,330 --> 02:25:29,081
We thought like,

5074
02:25:29,081 --> 02:25:30,490
I thought he was Hitler like that.

5075
02:25:30,510 --> 02:25:31,320
I mean,

5076
02:25:31,320 --> 02:25:34,720
and I remember coming up to him when I
eventually met him later at the comedy

5077
02:25:34,721 --> 02:25:35,554
store with you.

5078
02:25:35,560 --> 02:25:36,100
I remember going,

5079
02:25:36,100 --> 02:25:36,881
Jesus Christ,

5080
02:25:36,881 --> 02:25:37,091
man,

5081
02:25:37,091 --> 02:25:37,691
I was,

5082
02:25:37,691 --> 02:25:38,620
I hated you.

5083
02:25:42,290 --> 02:25:44,520
I think that's nice when
people come up to you and say,

5084
02:25:44,521 --> 02:25:45,340
I hated you.

5085
02:25:45,340 --> 02:25:45,901
You'd like that.

5086
02:25:45,901 --> 02:25:46,260
Okay.

5087
02:25:46,260 --> 02:25:46,591
Yeah,

5088
02:25:46,591 --> 02:25:48,930
because then that means you like them now,

5089
02:25:49,100 --> 02:25:49,291
right?

5090
02:25:49,291 --> 02:25:49,950
You've won them over.

5091
02:25:49,950 --> 02:25:50,550
No.

5092
02:25:50,550 --> 02:25:51,000
Yeah,

5093
02:25:51,000 --> 02:25:53,010
but it's cool when people can admit that.

5094
02:25:53,320 --> 02:25:54,160
Do people say that to you?

5095
02:25:54,320 --> 02:25:54,691
Yeah.

5096
02:25:54,691 --> 02:25:55,430
Did you,

5097
02:25:55,430 --> 02:25:59,420
is it guys usually know it can be guys.

5098
02:25:59,421 --> 02:26:00,230
Yeah.

5099
02:26:00,230 --> 02:26:02,540
Guys will say shit like the girls
just to knock him down a peg.

5100
02:26:03,050 --> 02:26:03,883
I actually hated you.

5101
02:26:03,920 --> 02:26:05,630
I don't even think you were
hot right when it first.

5102
02:26:05,631 --> 02:26:05,770
Yeah.

5103
02:26:05,770 --> 02:26:06,191
Met You.

5104
02:26:06,191 --> 02:26:06,971
I hated you.

5105
02:26:06,971 --> 02:26:07,804
Or like,

5106
02:26:07,870 --> 02:26:11,860
or because I picked on somebody because
they picked on somebody in the audience.

5107
02:26:11,920 --> 02:26:12,910
That's why they hated you.

5108
02:26:12,940 --> 02:26:13,840
They'll hate me.

5109
02:26:14,200 --> 02:26:14,740
No.

5110
02:26:14,740 --> 02:26:14,921
Yeah,

5111
02:26:14,921 --> 02:26:15,890
but why would you pick on Sunday?

5112
02:26:15,910 --> 02:26:16,120
You,

5113
02:26:16,120 --> 02:26:16,351
you,

5114
02:26:16,351 --> 02:26:17,320
if you were picking on someone,

5115
02:26:17,321 --> 02:26:18,580
I couldn't imagine being vicious.

5116
02:26:18,780 --> 02:26:19,960
You're not a vicious person.

5117
02:26:21,250 --> 02:26:23,170
So you think are very vicious.

5118
02:26:23,200 --> 02:26:24,033
Are you?

5119
02:26:24,220 --> 02:26:26,980
I can be vicious on stage
into the microphone.

5120
02:26:26,981 --> 02:26:27,430
Yeah.

5121
02:26:27,430 --> 02:26:27,860
Why?

5122
02:26:27,860 --> 02:26:30,000
I'm just going to throw a
punch because it's doggy dog.

5123
02:26:30,010 --> 02:26:31,030
Cause you gotta do what you gotta do.

5124
02:26:31,031 --> 02:26:31,690
Is that what it is?

5125
02:26:31,690 --> 02:26:31,901
No,

5126
02:26:31,901 --> 02:26:32,650
because like,

5127
02:26:32,650 --> 02:26:33,101
you know,

5128
02:26:33,101 --> 02:26:37,300
it's just easy to make fun of guys who
are alone in a comedy club when everybody

5129
02:26:37,301 --> 02:26:38,790
else is in a couple in,

5130
02:26:38,810 --> 02:26:39,970
in a relationship.

5131
02:26:40,280 --> 02:26:42,030
How ironic that you
make fun of those guys,

5132
02:26:42,190 --> 02:26:43,820
those the ones that would
rape you and kill you.

5133
02:26:44,250 --> 02:26:45,280
It's weird.

5134
02:26:47,130 --> 02:26:47,431
No,

5135
02:26:47,431 --> 02:26:48,120
I'm your enemy.

5136
02:26:48,120 --> 02:26:48,301
No,

5137
02:26:48,301 --> 02:26:49,200
I make fun of,

5138
02:26:49,350 --> 02:26:52,080
I made fun of the husbands
and the boyfriends too.

5139
02:26:52,320 --> 02:26:52,700
Ah.

5140
02:26:52,700 --> 02:26:55,980
It's like sometimes the
ones who are by themselves,

5141
02:26:56,670 --> 02:26:57,570
we'll get creepy.

5142
02:26:57,571 --> 02:26:58,410
Mad At me.

5143
02:26:58,680 --> 02:26:59,513
I'm sure.

5144
02:26:59,540 --> 02:27:00,373
I'm sure.

5145
02:27:00,690 --> 02:27:01,380
Kiana.

5146
02:27:01,380 --> 02:27:02,213
Yeah,

5147
02:27:02,220 --> 02:27:03,120
dudes are creepy.

5148
02:27:03,270 --> 02:27:03,961
They're dangerous.

5149
02:27:03,961 --> 02:27:04,620
Yeah.

5150
02:27:04,620 --> 02:27:05,940
Picking on dudes is dangerous.

5151
02:27:06,290 --> 02:27:06,561
Well,

5152
02:27:06,561 --> 02:27:09,370
picking on like happily
married or boyfriend dudes,

5153
02:27:09,840 --> 02:27:11,150
you know it's safer.

5154
02:27:11,240 --> 02:27:12,073
Safer.

5155
02:27:12,140 --> 02:27:13,040
I'm going to write this down.

5156
02:27:13,400 --> 02:27:14,233
Write it down.

5157
02:27:14,640 --> 02:27:18,390
He lesson 101 loners.

5158
02:27:18,660 --> 02:27:21,890
They don't pick on the loaner single dude,

5159
02:27:22,070 --> 02:27:26,020
the quiet loner at the colony
club with his hands inside of his

5160
02:27:28,020 --> 02:27:31,230
would those big jackets
from the outlaw Josey Wales?

5161
02:27:31,490 --> 02:27:33,210
Well those who's called
trench coach edge cuts.

5162
02:27:33,600 --> 02:27:33,900
Have you,

5163
02:27:33,900 --> 02:27:35,400
have you made any music videos lately?

5164
02:27:35,401 --> 02:27:37,530
She has so many for
hilarious music videos.

5165
02:27:37,531 --> 02:27:40,290
She's a very talented musician and
when like one of her favorites,

5166
02:27:40,320 --> 02:27:41,970
my favorite songs that she does his card,

5167
02:27:41,971 --> 02:27:45,040
I bought a dildo on Amazon and stuff
like that and she has these will really

5168
02:27:45,050 --> 02:27:45,730
close with the axis.

5169
02:27:45,730 --> 02:27:46,563
We've got to get out of here.

5170
02:27:46,570 --> 02:27:47,940
High quality videos?

5171
02:27:48,420 --> 02:27:48,660
No,

5172
02:27:48,660 --> 02:27:49,580
I'm in the process of,

5173
02:27:49,581 --> 02:27:50,150
I mean I'm,

5174
02:27:50,150 --> 02:27:54,020
I'm making videos right now so I'm
recording songs and it's so good.

5175
02:27:54,021 --> 02:27:55,310
A new one will come out soon,

5176
02:27:55,311 --> 02:27:55,820
but

5177
02:27:55,820 --> 02:27:56,750
so can we play that?

5178
02:27:57,320 --> 02:27:59,160
I bought a deldot on Amazon,

5179
02:27:59,180 --> 02:27:59,791

5180
02:27:59,791 --> 02:28:00,380

5186
02:28:06,950 --> 02:28:07,580
Okay,

let's play that one.

5188
02:28:08,660 --> 02:28:09,440
Can we feel,

5189
02:28:09,440 --> 02:28:10,790
can you feel that menstrual pain,

5190
02:28:11,120 --> 02:28:11,511
Esther?

5191
02:28:11,511 --> 02:28:11,841
Cool.

5192
02:28:11,841 --> 02:28:13,010
Thank you very much for being here.

5193
02:28:13,011 --> 02:28:13,844

5194
02:28:14,150 --> 02:28:14,983

5195
02:28:14,990 --> 02:28:15,740

Thank you for now.

5201
02:28:23,330 --> 02:28:25,370
They were about to change that you want,

5202
02:28:25,480 --> 02:28:27,050
I've never thought a dick pic on Twitter.

5203
02:28:27,890 --> 02:28:32,890
Pair yourself for a tsunami of veiny
man meat cause it's on your way.

5204
02:28:33,680 --> 02:28:34,251
Guaranteed.

5205
02:28:34,251 --> 02:28:35,510
You have a picture of their,

5206
02:28:35,511 --> 02:28:36,910
but they're about what?

5207
02:28:36,920 --> 02:28:37,753
You're going to get that too,

5208
02:28:37,840 --> 02:28:39,280
but it's more than penises.

5209
02:28:39,290 --> 02:28:41,280
Your end of buttholes or buts like

5210
02:28:43,950 --> 02:28:44,783
penis,

5211
02:28:45,230 --> 02:28:46,063
penis fan.

5212
02:28:46,140 --> 02:28:47,200
Well I am,

5213
02:28:47,201 --> 02:28:48,420
but not looking at,

5214
02:28:48,480 --> 02:28:49,020
you know,

5215
02:28:49,020 --> 02:28:50,070
so you just like,

5216
02:28:50,120 --> 02:28:51,030
you don't like the Butthole,

5217
02:28:51,050 --> 02:28:51,510
you like the,

5218
02:28:51,510 --> 02:28:56,510
but it talks like a nice no ingrown hairs.

5219
02:28:57,380 --> 02:28:58,213
Something big.

5220
02:29:00,260 --> 02:29:02,210
Something that delivers the Bacon.

5221
02:29:02,480 --> 02:29:03,980
Right Esther?

5222
02:29:04,140 --> 02:29:04,973
Cool.

5223
02:29:05,300 --> 02:29:08,870
You could see her if you want
to watch repeats of Girl Code,

5224
02:29:08,871 --> 02:29:11,210
but they didn't pay
her so she kept moving.

5225
02:29:11,450 --> 02:29:12,283
Can you see,

5226
02:29:12,290 --> 02:29:13,640
can you feel my menstrual pain?

5227
02:29:13,670 --> 02:29:18,670
You could listen to this and watch this
on youtube and you can catch Esther all

5228
02:29:18,981 --> 02:29:21,800
around the fucking world doing standup
because she's gangster like that,

5229
02:29:21,830 --> 02:29:22,663
right?

5230
02:29:27,550 --> 02:29:28,383

Isn't it?

Yes.

5241
02:29:45,950 --> 02:29:46,490

5255
02:30:10,581 --> 02:30:13,550
I'm getting you were going
to get you ham her nice.

5256
02:30:13,640 --> 02:30:15,140
We're going down hard.

5257
02:30:15,141 --> 02:30:16,200
Brought Brian.

5258
02:30:16,250 --> 02:30:18,200
Sweetie is turning 48 years old.

5259
02:30:19,720 --> 02:30:20,400
That's what I am.

5260
02:30:20,400 --> 02:30:20,870
I'm old.

5261
02:30:20,870 --> 02:30:21,910
I'll be 48 in August.

5262
02:30:22,930 --> 02:30:23,571
I'm almost 40 now.

5263
02:30:23,571 --> 02:30:25,700
Remember when you turn 40 what else?

5264
02:30:25,860 --> 02:30:28,130
Shocking time waits for no man.

5265
02:30:28,790 --> 02:30:29,200
Damn.

5266
02:30:29,200 --> 02:30:31,220
I'm going to be 48 40 dark.

5267
02:30:31,360 --> 02:30:32,091
No Dude.

5268
02:30:32,091 --> 02:30:37,091
48 I was born in 1967
I was born August 11th,

5269
02:30:37,250 --> 02:30:39,350
1967 so this August 11th,

5270
02:30:39,351 --> 02:30:40,380
I'll be 48 years old.

5271
02:30:40,440 --> 02:30:41,450
Homeless Dude,

5272
02:30:41,451 --> 02:30:43,160
I'm closing on 50 yeah,

5273
02:30:43,430 --> 02:30:45,670
dude con Tom Cruise's 50 fucking one.

5274
02:30:45,690 --> 02:30:46,580
That's ridiculous.

5275
02:30:46,610 --> 02:30:47,443
It's crazy.

5276
02:30:47,540 --> 02:30:47,990
It's just,

5277
02:30:47,990 --> 02:30:48,823
it's happening.

5278
02:30:49,760 --> 02:30:50,690
Thank you very much.

5279
02:30:51,310 --> 02:30:52,430
I feel so good now.

5280
02:30:53,420 --> 02:30:54,050
Do some good.

5281
02:30:54,050 --> 02:30:55,970
I don't get depressed about my age.

5282
02:30:56,030 --> 02:30:59,150
It's like I get depressive body
parts aren't working correctly,

5283
02:30:59,480 --> 02:30:59,781
you know,

5284
02:30:59,781 --> 02:31:01,370
like injuries and stuff like that.

5285
02:31:01,371 --> 02:31:03,350
But that's just for me being a retard.

5286
02:31:03,530 --> 02:31:04,351
It takes longer to heal,

5287
02:31:04,351 --> 02:31:05,630
to recover from an injury.

5288
02:31:05,690 --> 02:31:06,550
I fix all that other,

5289
02:31:06,600 --> 02:31:08,570
I go to doctors get the injections,

5290
02:31:11,720 --> 02:31:13,700
steroid injections
don't really fix things.

5291
02:31:14,150 --> 02:31:14,330
Uh,

5292
02:31:14,330 --> 02:31:18,200
steroids can fixing cortisone mostly.

5293
02:31:18,230 --> 02:31:18,830
Yeah,

5294
02:31:18,830 --> 02:31:19,830
that's a little bit different

5295
02:31:20,100 --> 02:31:23,160
that that would really does
with a cortisone shot does,

5296
02:31:23,161 --> 02:31:24,540
is really just numbs the pain.

5297
02:31:24,990 --> 02:31:28,800
It actually can become more problematic
for people that have injuries because

5298
02:31:28,801 --> 02:31:31,510
you get a cortisone shot
in your knee or in a,

5299
02:31:31,520 --> 02:31:31,860
you know,

5300
02:31:31,860 --> 02:31:33,180
your joints or something like that.

5301
02:31:33,181 --> 02:31:35,280
And then while you're working out,

5302
02:31:35,310 --> 02:31:36,270
you're not feeling any pain.

5303
02:31:36,271 --> 02:31:37,440
We were still doing injury.

5304
02:31:37,560 --> 02:31:40,680
You're still grinding on an injury
and you can actually like Bas Rutten,

5305
02:31:40,681 --> 02:31:44,910
he's all fucked up cause he got cortisone
shots in his knees and cortisone shots

5306
02:31:44,911 --> 02:31:46,740
in his elbows and he kept fighting,

5307
02:31:47,070 --> 02:31:47,401
you know,

5308
02:31:47,401 --> 02:31:50,490
like he had all this pain and so we just
get cortisone shots and now it's just

5309
02:31:50,610 --> 02:31:54,000
joints are destroyed and he
just like was too tough for,

5310
02:31:54,001 --> 02:31:55,080
for his own body.

5311
02:31:55,350 --> 02:31:57,090
But I got a stem cell injection.

5312
02:31:57,330 --> 02:31:58,710
I got one recently had,

5313
02:31:58,740 --> 02:32:02,970
I was worried that I was going to have
to get shoulder surgery from a woman's

5314
02:32:02,971 --> 02:32:03,804
placenta.

5315
02:32:03,850 --> 02:32:04,830
Oh my God.

5316
02:32:05,220 --> 02:32:05,761
Total.

5317
02:32:05,761 --> 02:32:06,930
You mean next level?

5318
02:32:06,931 --> 02:32:07,764
Shit.

5319
02:32:08,300 --> 02:32:12,150
There's a company that collects women's
stem cells from their menstrual blood

5320
02:32:12,180 --> 02:32:15,240
and stores planned parenthood's
cause supposedly cells,

5321
02:32:15,270 --> 02:32:18,090
they aborted stem cells and
makes money off of that.

5322
02:32:18,091 --> 02:32:19,380
But that might be abortion talk.

5323
02:32:19,650 --> 02:32:20,230
No,

5324
02:32:20,230 --> 02:32:21,960
I'm pretty sure that's not,

5325
02:32:22,020 --> 02:32:23,910
it seems like it should be bullshit,

5326
02:32:23,911 --> 02:32:26,550
but I'm pretty sure there's like
a real investigation into that.

5327
02:32:26,551 --> 02:32:27,090
Yeah,

5328
02:32:27,090 --> 02:32:27,331
look,

5329
02:32:27,331 --> 02:32:27,750
it could,

5330
02:32:27,750 --> 02:32:28,920
it could happen because look,

5331
02:32:28,921 --> 02:32:33,720
the d the cells are viable and the idea
of not using them to me is more fucked

5332
02:32:33,721 --> 02:32:34,710
up than using them.

5333
02:32:35,040 --> 02:32:35,311
I mean,

5334
02:32:35,311 --> 02:32:36,630
if you're going to end board a fetus,

5335
02:32:36,631 --> 02:32:38,430
shouldn't you at least use those cells?

5336
02:32:38,431 --> 02:32:39,720
Cycle it use every part.

5337
02:32:39,721 --> 02:32:42,240
But people were worried that people going
to have abortions on purpose to make

5338
02:32:42,241 --> 02:32:43,740
money for the stem cells.

5339
02:32:44,430 --> 02:32:44,850
But anyway,

5340
02:32:44,850 --> 02:32:46,900
what they do is when a
woman has a csection,

5341
02:32:47,100 --> 02:32:51,360
they take the placenta from the
c section and they use it to,

5342
02:32:51,390 --> 02:32:51,770
uh,

5343
02:32:51,770 --> 02:32:51,950
they,

5344
02:32:51,950 --> 02:32:53,460
they harvest the stem cells from this,

5345
02:32:53,461 --> 02:32:56,310
they freeze it and then they thought
out and injected into your injury.

5346
02:32:56,550 --> 02:33:00,090
And I had a shoulder that was
fucking with me for like a year,

5347
02:33:00,120 --> 02:33:00,990
like a solid year.

5348
02:33:00,991 --> 02:33:01,591
I'd work out,

5349
02:33:01,591 --> 02:33:02,460
it would get swollen.

5350
02:33:02,670 --> 02:33:03,990
I said it would get better,

5351
02:33:03,991 --> 02:33:06,660
but it never totally got better
and I could do most things,

5352
02:33:06,810 --> 02:33:07,860
but it was always in pain.

5353
02:33:08,250 --> 02:33:11,820
I got the stem cell injection two and a
half weeks ago cause I was worried that

5354
02:33:11,821 --> 02:33:13,050
I was going to have to get surgery.

5355
02:33:13,200 --> 02:33:14,210
I had one doctor had said,

5356
02:33:14,230 --> 02:33:15,060
get surgery.

5357
02:33:15,060 --> 02:33:15,271
He's like,

5358
02:33:15,271 --> 02:33:16,140
you're probably gonna need surgery.

5359
02:33:16,141 --> 02:33:17,130
And then another doctor said,

5360
02:33:17,580 --> 02:33:19,110
I'm went to an actual orthopedic surgeon.

5361
02:33:19,111 --> 02:33:19,501
He was like,

5362
02:33:19,501 --> 02:33:19,800
no,

5363
02:33:19,800 --> 02:33:20,940
you have too much function,

5364
02:33:21,420 --> 02:33:22,290
moves it too much.

5365
02:33:22,560 --> 02:33:25,080
Let's just try to rehab it
and see like if those tears,

5366
02:33:25,081 --> 02:33:25,501
if they'll,

5367
02:33:25,501 --> 02:33:26,334
they'll heal up.

5368
02:33:26,430 --> 02:33:28,890
I got the stem cell shot
within two and a half weeks.

5369
02:33:29,190 --> 02:33:30,780
It feels like there's nothing
wrong with my shoulder.

5370
02:33:30,960 --> 02:33:32,340
It's fucking crazy.

5371
02:33:32,550 --> 02:33:36,000
It's crazy because it's supposed to last
like it's supposed to be like six to

5372
02:33:36,001 --> 02:33:38,220
eight weeks to when you say
you feel the real impact.

5373
02:33:38,440 --> 02:33:39,710
And then I talked to Daniel Cormier,

5374
02:33:39,790 --> 02:33:40,441
Daniel Cormier,

5375
02:33:40,441 --> 02:33:41,700
the UFC light heavyweight champ.

5376
02:33:42,030 --> 02:33:45,060
He had a knee injury and his knee was
fucked up and he was thinking about

5377
02:33:45,061 --> 02:33:46,680
getting surgery and he was putting it off.

5378
02:33:46,681 --> 02:33:48,120
And I talked to him a year ago about this.

5379
02:33:48,420 --> 02:33:48,691
He's like,

5380
02:33:48,691 --> 02:33:49,524
I don't know.

5381
02:33:49,940 --> 02:33:50,250
You know,

5382
02:33:50,250 --> 02:33:51,610
eventually when we get surgery I think,

5383
02:33:51,611 --> 02:33:52,444
and I'm trying to put it off,

5384
02:33:52,470 --> 02:33:53,490
he got the stem cells,

5385
02:33:53,610 --> 02:33:54,443
Bam.

5386
02:33:54,450 --> 02:33:55,261
All of a sudden he's like,

5387
02:33:55,261 --> 02:33:56,071
it's amazing.

5388
02:33:56,071 --> 02:33:57,660
It's like right away it felt better.

5389
02:33:57,740 --> 02:33:58,170
They feel,

5390
02:33:58,170 --> 02:34:00,150
and I don't know who it was,

5391
02:34:00,300 --> 02:34:01,133
but did I give her a hug?

5392
02:34:01,510 --> 02:34:02,880
Tell her they don't tell you.

5393
02:34:02,970 --> 02:34:03,481
Oh No,

5394
02:34:03,481 --> 02:34:03,631
no,

5395
02:34:03,631 --> 02:34:06,540
they definitely don't tell you because
that woman's stem cells probably went to

5396
02:34:06,541 --> 02:34:11,010
untold numbers of people cause it's a
small amount of the amount that they had

5397
02:34:11,011 --> 02:34:11,630
in this little,

5398
02:34:11,630 --> 02:34:13,320
in this little syringe,

5399
02:34:13,321 --> 02:34:14,111
when they inject it in,

5400
02:34:14,111 --> 02:34:16,420
you kind of connected to her in some way.

5401
02:34:16,620 --> 02:34:18,130
It's somewhere starting

5402
02:34:18,130 --> 02:34:19,210
your period and your neck.

5403
02:34:19,270 --> 02:34:19,421
Well,

5404
02:34:19,421 --> 02:34:20,201
I have some other stuff.

5405
02:34:20,201 --> 02:34:21,070
I have a cadaver,

5406
02:34:21,390 --> 02:34:22,210
a joint.

5407
02:34:22,210 --> 02:34:22,560
I have,

5408
02:34:22,560 --> 02:34:23,080
um,

5409
02:34:23,080 --> 02:34:25,000
my left knee has a cadaver.

5410
02:34:25,030 --> 02:34:25,360
No,

5411
02:34:25,360 --> 02:34:25,990
my right knee.

5412
02:34:25,990 --> 02:34:28,000
My right knee has a cadaver ACL.

5413
02:34:28,030 --> 02:34:29,500
It's extra a cadavers,

5414
02:34:29,860 --> 02:34:30,693
um,

5415
02:34:30,760 --> 02:34:31,091
uh,

5416
02:34:31,091 --> 02:34:35,710
Achilles tendon cause Achilles tendon
as much fatter than a human ACL.

5417
02:34:36,130 --> 02:34:38,170
And so they take this kid Achilles tendon,

5418
02:34:38,171 --> 02:34:38,801
they open you up,

5419
02:34:38,801 --> 02:34:39,640
they put it in place,

5420
02:34:39,641 --> 02:34:40,090
screw it,

5421
02:34:40,090 --> 02:34:40,923
screw it down.

5422
02:34:41,140 --> 02:34:46,140
And then your body repopulates this
cadaver the dead person's Achilles tendon.

5423
02:34:46,481 --> 02:34:49,030
So it's much thicker than a regular ACL.

5424
02:34:49,300 --> 02:34:54,300
So my ACL and my right knee is like 150%
stronger than a regular ACL because it

5425
02:34:54,731 --> 02:34:55,330
was an a,

5426
02:34:55,330 --> 02:34:56,890
an ACL from an Achilles tendon.

5427
02:34:57,570 --> 02:34:59,620
Do you have two new inner
voices that are new,

5428
02:35:00,940 --> 02:35:01,600
new inner voice?

5429
02:35:01,600 --> 02:35:02,620
I think that might be my problem.

5430
02:35:03,470 --> 02:35:04,840
Too much dead people,

5431
02:35:04,841 --> 02:35:06,090
parts and baby farms.

5432
02:35:06,310 --> 02:35:08,230
You have a girl's voice in a guy's voice,

5433
02:35:08,710 --> 02:35:12,190
but I'll tell you that growing baby teeth
on your shoulder and we'll pull them

5434
02:35:12,191 --> 02:35:12,550
out.

5435
02:35:12,550 --> 02:35:13,750
The fucking pair of pliers.

5436
02:35:13,790 --> 02:35:14,623
And I'm a man.

5437
02:35:14,840 --> 02:35:15,440
I'm no,

5438
02:35:15,440 --> 02:35:17,140
it looks as long as it fixes my shoulder.

5439
02:35:17,141 --> 02:35:21,460
And right now if my shoulder does not
get any better and stays right here and

5440
02:35:21,461 --> 02:35:22,271
doesn't get any worse,

5441
02:35:22,271 --> 02:35:25,270
I'm fucking super happy because
there's no pain right now.

5442
02:35:25,300 --> 02:35:26,133
I mean I'm,

5443
02:35:26,580 --> 02:35:26,950
I'm not,

5444
02:35:26,950 --> 02:35:30,430
I'm not feeling any pain and I'm still
doing all these rehab exercises so it's

5445
02:35:30,431 --> 02:35:31,091
all strong.

5446
02:35:31,091 --> 02:35:32,080
I can do things with it.

5447
02:35:32,500 --> 02:35:33,760
I might be able to avoid surgery.

5448
02:35:33,790 --> 02:35:35,500
I think there's just some tears in there,

5449
02:35:35,501 --> 02:35:36,800
but I'm pretty sure they're healing up.

5450
02:35:36,801 --> 02:35:37,960
Psalms going on in there.

5451
02:35:37,990 --> 02:35:38,630
It's great.

5452
02:35:38,630 --> 02:35:40,350
Some new next level shit happening.

5453
02:35:40,360 --> 02:35:45,360
But those lenses that can make you see
way better than 2020 stem cell injections

5454
02:35:45,461 --> 02:35:46,294
when you have injuries.

5455
02:35:46,390 --> 02:35:47,171
I've never had anything.

5456
02:35:47,171 --> 02:35:49,120
He'll up this quick cause it's crazy.

5457
02:35:49,121 --> 02:35:52,450
It's kind of spooky because this thing
was fucking with me for a long time,

5458
02:35:52,451 --> 02:35:52,751
man.

5459
02:35:52,751 --> 02:35:53,291
You know what?

5460
02:35:53,291 --> 02:35:54,670
When women have their periods,

5461
02:35:54,671 --> 02:35:57,760
we lose all our stem cells
from the uterus lining.

5462
02:35:57,910 --> 02:36:02,910
They should collect it and store it and
use it for when you need a stem cell for

5463
02:36:03,070 --> 02:36:03,790
your neck.

5464
02:36:03,790 --> 02:36:04,840
I think they're doing it.

5465
02:36:04,841 --> 02:36:05,680
I think they're doing that.

5466
02:36:06,070 --> 02:36:07,480
This company went bankrupt.

5467
02:36:07,810 --> 02:36:08,501
We're not bankrupt,

5468
02:36:08,501 --> 02:36:10,570
but they said enough people didn't get it.

5469
02:36:10,571 --> 02:36:12,670
So they're not collecting
menstrual blood anymore,

5470
02:36:12,730 --> 02:36:14,320
but you know they do
them from your own fat.

5471
02:36:14,440 --> 02:36:15,400
So here's a win.

5472
02:36:15,401 --> 02:36:17,920
When they take the fat
out of your love handles,

5473
02:36:17,921 --> 02:36:19,900
they light Bo you and
they take your faith.

5474
02:36:20,440 --> 02:36:21,710
You don't need any lipid hooker.

5475
02:36:21,780 --> 02:36:22,240
We talk.

5476
02:36:22,240 --> 02:36:22,480
I,

5477
02:36:22,480 --> 02:36:23,313
I do.

5478
02:36:23,460 --> 02:36:27,610
What do they do or is
it just an even trade?

5479
02:36:27,610 --> 02:36:29,350
Like I wouldn't pay for it.

5480
02:36:29,800 --> 02:36:30,190
They don't,

5481
02:36:30,190 --> 02:36:32,020
they don't pay you for your fat.

5482
02:36:32,230 --> 02:36:34,090
Why don't take that much either.

5483
02:36:34,091 --> 02:36:34,630
Dude.

5484
02:36:34,630 --> 02:36:35,380
I have a lot though.

5485
02:36:35,380 --> 02:36:35,621
Yeah,

5486
02:36:35,621 --> 02:36:36,760
but they don't take enough.

5487
02:36:37,210 --> 02:36:40,420
Like you got to eat vegetables and go
running up hills and stopped smoking

5488
02:36:40,421 --> 02:36:40,841
cigarettes.

5489
02:36:40,841 --> 02:36:42,910
So you get to stop what you're doing.

5490
02:36:43,120 --> 02:36:44,710
I can't believe you're back
smoking cigarettes again.

5491
02:36:44,740 --> 02:36:45,800
Back to smoking a cigarette.

5492
02:36:45,801 --> 02:36:46,900
He smoked three cigarettes a day,

5493
02:36:46,901 --> 02:36:47,650
right?

5494
02:36:47,650 --> 02:36:49,180
Three cigarettes compared to two packs.

5495
02:36:49,181 --> 02:36:50,430
It's still smoking cigarettes.

5496
02:36:50,440 --> 02:36:51,280
Kinda Stop Dude.

5497
02:36:51,281 --> 02:36:52,110
I swear to God.

5498
02:36:52,110 --> 02:36:52,390
You know,

5499
02:36:52,390 --> 02:36:54,640
I talked to that writer that was in here.

5500
02:36:54,641 --> 02:36:55,860
It says one of my biggest fears,

5501
02:36:55,870 --> 02:36:57,430
I worry about you getting sick.

5502
02:36:57,790 --> 02:36:59,380
I really do cause you're always smoking.

5503
02:36:59,750 --> 02:37:01,120
You were at least for a long time.

5504
02:37:01,121 --> 02:37:01,771
I worry about it.

5505
02:37:01,771 --> 02:37:02,604
I that's a real,

5506
02:37:02,620 --> 02:37:05,020
that's one that gets you
and once it gets he like,

5507
02:37:05,021 --> 02:37:05,501
fuck,

5508
02:37:05,501 --> 02:37:06,550
I could have avoided this.

5509
02:37:07,120 --> 02:37:07,781
That's a scary,

5510
02:37:07,781 --> 02:37:10,990
it's so scary to be close to someone and
care about them like I care about you

5511
02:37:11,230 --> 02:37:15,410
and then see you smoking and know that
that's eventually going to get you like,

5512
02:37:15,470 --> 02:37:16,010
do you

5513
02:37:16,010 --> 02:37:16,521
know that?

5514
02:37:16,521 --> 02:37:19,520
I think they need to make no
smoking at the comedy store.

5515
02:37:19,850 --> 02:37:21,440
That's not going to ever happen.

5516
02:37:21,470 --> 02:37:22,700
That's never going to happen.

5517
02:37:22,730 --> 02:37:24,650
We just need to go to a vapor cigarettes.

5518
02:37:24,680 --> 02:37:26,240
Just go to vapor cigarettes and just,

5519
02:37:26,241 --> 02:37:27,470
and just tell yourself,

5520
02:37:27,471 --> 02:37:28,790
you can't smoke cigarettes.

5521
02:37:29,270 --> 02:37:30,230
I need to get new vapor.

5522
02:37:30,380 --> 02:37:31,730
You got free for a while.

5523
02:37:31,731 --> 02:37:32,720
How long did your free for?

5524
02:37:32,721 --> 02:37:33,970
A couple of months and I go,

5525
02:37:34,030 --> 02:37:34,250
yeah,

5526
02:37:34,250 --> 02:37:34,820
month,

5527
02:37:34,820 --> 02:37:35,361
month and a half.

5528
02:37:35,361 --> 02:37:36,194
Something like that.

5529
02:37:36,350 --> 02:37:36,861
You can do it,

5530
02:37:36,861 --> 02:37:38,140
dude do.

5531
02:37:38,141 --> 02:37:38,620
You can do it.

5532
02:37:38,620 --> 02:37:38,690
Oh,

5533
02:37:38,690 --> 02:37:39,523
I know a good deal.

5534
02:37:39,540 --> 02:37:40,373
Yeah.

5535
02:37:40,640 --> 02:37:41,870
You just have to want to do it.

5536
02:37:41,900 --> 02:37:42,560
Yeah.

5537
02:37:42,560 --> 02:37:43,730
I was trying to say,

5538
02:37:43,731 --> 02:37:45,260
when you're going to
stop smoking cigarettes,

5539
02:37:45,261 --> 02:37:46,310
give yourself a couple of weeks.

5540
02:37:46,311 --> 02:37:47,300
You just start smoking,

5541
02:37:47,301 --> 02:37:48,050
right?

5542
02:37:48,050 --> 02:37:49,130
Not Cigarettes.

5543
02:37:50,120 --> 02:37:50,810
Weed.

5544
02:37:50,810 --> 02:37:52,040
You smoke weed Esther.

5545
02:37:52,130 --> 02:37:52,963
Yeah.

5546
02:37:53,720 --> 02:37:54,553
Waiting man.

5547
02:37:55,310 --> 02:37:55,701
Wait a minute.

5548
02:37:55,701 --> 02:37:56,534
You smoke pot.

5549
02:37:57,380 --> 02:37:58,730
That's how she makes this great music.

5550
02:37:59,440 --> 02:38:01,490
We smoke pot with her
right before the show.

5551
02:38:01,490 --> 02:38:01,911
Brian,

5552
02:38:01,911 --> 02:38:03,870
do you think I forgot the dairy.

5553
02:38:03,950 --> 02:38:04,491
All right Esther,

5554
02:38:04,491 --> 02:38:05,930
thank you so much for being on a show.

5555
02:38:06,440 --> 02:38:07,131
It was a lot of fun.

5556
02:38:07,131 --> 02:38:08,570
It was always cool hanging
with you at the store.

5557
02:38:08,571 --> 02:38:10,160
So I'm glad we finally
got a chance to do this.

5558
02:38:10,161 --> 02:38:10,581
You're cool.

5559
02:38:10,581 --> 02:38:12,050
Chick strs for having me.

5560
02:38:12,070 --> 02:38:12,891
Cool human being.

5561
02:38:12,891 --> 02:38:14,060
I shouldn't qualify that.

5562
02:38:14,061 --> 02:38:14,570
You're a woman.

5563
02:38:14,570 --> 02:38:14,960
You're just,

5564
02:38:14,960 --> 02:38:15,441
you're just cool.

5565
02:38:15,441 --> 02:38:16,220
Cool Gal.

5566
02:38:16,220 --> 02:38:17,053
We Love Ya.

5567
02:38:17,180 --> 02:38:17,780
And uh,

5568
02:38:17,780 --> 02:38:18,860
Brian again,

5569
02:38:18,861 --> 02:38:21,950
tomorrow night he will be
at the San Jose Improv,

5570
02:38:21,951 --> 02:38:23,780
which is one of the coolest
clubs in the country.

5571
02:38:23,781 --> 02:38:24,790
It's a fantastic cloud.

5572
02:38:24,800 --> 02:38:25,820
Used to be an old theater,

5573
02:38:26,120 --> 02:38:27,020
really sweet,

5574
02:38:27,021 --> 02:38:28,370
sweet setup and that spot.

5575
02:38:28,580 --> 02:38:28,821
What?

5576
02:38:28,821 --> 02:38:31,160
The Great Dean del Rey.

5577
02:38:31,400 --> 02:38:33,770
And if you're a Harley
Davidson fan as an extra bonus,

5578
02:38:33,771 --> 02:38:35,610
there'll be Harley Davidson's onstage.

5579
02:38:35,630 --> 02:38:36,100
Yeah.

5580
02:38:36,100 --> 02:38:36,661
Slow.

5581
02:38:36,661 --> 02:38:39,530
Are you dean sponsored by Harley.

5582
02:38:39,550 --> 02:38:41,160
So he brings the motorcycles.

5583
02:38:41,440 --> 02:38:41,950
They do.

5584
02:38:41,950 --> 02:38:44,270
They just shut the Harleys
on stage with them.

5585
02:38:44,271 --> 02:38:45,470
He gets a free Harley.

5586
02:38:45,620 --> 02:38:47,450
He rides his own Harley
that they gave him.

5587
02:38:47,451 --> 02:38:49,750
And then at the end of the year
because he worked for Harley.

5588
02:38:49,780 --> 02:38:50,090
Yeah.

5589
02:38:50,090 --> 02:38:50,480
Yeah.

5590
02:38:50,480 --> 02:38:53,780
And you know there's their
sponsors sponsored by pens.

5591
02:38:54,590 --> 02:38:56,300
You could totally get sponsored by pens,

5592
02:38:56,480 --> 02:38:57,950
but you get something probably better.

5593
02:38:58,100 --> 02:38:58,610
Yeah,

5594
02:38:58,610 --> 02:38:59,780
like tampons or some shit.

5595
02:38:59,840 --> 02:39:00,673
She go for that.

5596
02:39:00,830 --> 02:39:02,150
What's like your favorite
thing in the world?

5597
02:39:03,390 --> 02:39:04,223
Um,

5598
02:39:07,250 --> 02:39:08,840
she's sponsored by Dick.

5599
02:39:09,000 --> 02:39:11,690
I'm just saying like what's your
favorite thing that you get sponsored by?

5600
02:39:11,720 --> 02:39:12,553
Um,

5601
02:39:12,950 --> 02:39:14,660
how about some kind of food?

5602
02:39:14,661 --> 02:39:15,590
I love donuts.

5603
02:39:15,620 --> 02:39:16,130
Donuts.

5604
02:39:16,130 --> 02:39:16,670
Perfect.

5605
02:39:16,670 --> 02:39:21,670
Krispy Kremes at Krispy Kreme sponsorship
with you on stage with a box of Krispy

5606
02:39:22,040 --> 02:39:24,800
Kremes in the middle of your
act you start chewing donuts.

5607
02:39:25,250 --> 02:39:25,971

5608
02:39:25,971 --> 02:39:26,330

5609
02:39:26,330 --> 02:39:27,080
bigger company.

5610
02:39:27,080 --> 02:39:28,700
Dean has like a motorcycle.

5611
02:39:29,030 --> 02:39:29,670
Let's talk about it.

5612
02:39:29,670 --> 02:39:31,490
Maybe everybody in the
audience gets his donut.

5613
02:39:31,670 --> 02:39:32,660
That's a lot of donuts.

5614
02:39:32,760 --> 02:39:33,230
It's a lot of them.

5615
02:39:33,230 --> 02:39:34,760
I know a lot of water wasted.

5616
02:39:34,761 --> 02:39:35,420
We're in a drought,

5617
02:39:35,420 --> 02:39:35,541

02:39:35,541 --> 02:39:36,374

5619
02:39:36,980 --> 02:39:37,200
Oh,

5620
02:39:37,200 --> 02:39:38,780
we'll get Brian holding it up.

5621
02:39:42,420 --> 02:39:42,861
All right,

5622
02:39:42,861 --> 02:39:43,430
