1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,630
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:02,341
Amazing is the,

3
00:00:02,341 --> 00:00:03,210
all the different shit.

4
00:00:03,211 --> 00:00:04,590
They can put webpages at four,

5
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:05,453
you know,

6
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:06,360
so the Webster story,

7
00:00:06,361 --> 00:00:07,020
so,

8
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:07,710
so I'm,

9
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:07,981
you know,

10
00:00:07,981 --> 00:00:08,814
at one of these,

11
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:09,541
um,

12
00:00:09,541 --> 00:00:10,291
network junk,

13
00:00:10,291 --> 00:00:14,640
it's where you go to promote your show
and stuff and all the other actors and

14
00:00:14,641 --> 00:00:15,840
cast or they're from the shows.

15
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,590
And this little man,

16
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:19,171
black kid,

17
00:00:19,171 --> 00:00:21,060
this tall was just cute as can be,

18
00:00:21,061 --> 00:00:21,400
man.

19
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:22,060
He's like,

20
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:25,800
I put them on my knee and I started
just playing with them and bouncing him

21
00:00:25,801 --> 00:00:30,000
around and he was giggling and
laughing and having a good time.

22
00:00:30,001 --> 00:00:31,680
And then like,

23
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:31,951
you know,

24
00:00:31,951 --> 00:00:32,611
I liked the kids,

25
00:00:32,611 --> 00:00:33,361
I've always liked kids.

26
00:00:33,361 --> 00:00:37,810
So I laid the kid back and I
blew like login in his neck.

27
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:39,800
Sherbert Zuber is that what it's called?

28
00:00:39,801 --> 00:00:43,250
But Dell calls it [inaudible] [inaudible]
bloom a couple of desserts and he's

29
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:44,370
like giggling like a little,

30
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:45,450
like a little four year old.

31
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:45,930
Right.

32
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:50,550
And I put them away in the linen and go
ahead now and I'm done playing with you.

33
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:52,200
And somebody comes over and says,

34
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:52,570
you know,

35
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:53,570
he's 16

36
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:57,053
we,

37
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,040
we're the same age ma'am.

38
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:02,820
He didn't say anything.

39
00:01:02,821 --> 00:01:03,560
He just laughs.

40
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,610
Oh my God.

41
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:07,440
That's the best story ever.

42
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:12,600
Holy Shit you fucking gave the
16 year old Webster observer

43
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:16,470
on a one on a one to 10.

44
00:01:16,471 --> 00:01:19,860
What was the embarrassment level
when you found out he was your age?

45
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:20,250
It was,

46
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:20,701
it was you.

47
00:01:20,701 --> 00:01:21,010
I feel.

48
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:21,843
Really?

49
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:22,763
What did you think?

50
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,450
I feel bad and I felt gross.

51
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:26,220
Oh my God.

52
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:27,553
Gross.

53
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,950
Did you apologize to him?

54
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:29,281
No.

55
00:01:29,281 --> 00:01:30,450
I'd call my again.

56
00:01:30,451 --> 00:01:31,190
Ever Hide?

57
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:31,441
No.

58
00:01:31,441 --> 00:01:31,771
Mike are,

59
00:01:31,771 --> 00:01:33,030
you didn't even apologize.

60
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:34,910
What's he really laughing
though when you did it?

61
00:01:34,911 --> 00:01:35,744
Or was he like,

62
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:41,190
he like if we had to go to training
because you had to go back and do it again

63
00:01:41,191 --> 00:01:41,551
today,

64
00:01:41,551 --> 00:01:42,150
would you?

65
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:42,301
Uh,

66
00:01:42,301 --> 00:01:43,140
would you apologize,

67
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:43,970
but I apologize.

68
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:44,230
No,

69
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:44,650
I just,

70
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:45,483
he wouldn't apologize

71
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,170
to Batten's humiliating to bed.

72
00:01:49,171 --> 00:01:50,640
There's no cell phone cameras back then.

73
00:01:50,641 --> 00:01:52,230
Could you imagine somebody filming that?

74
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,780
Dude can't.

75
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:56,100
Melissa Gilbert was teaching
me to juggle that day too.

76
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:56,811
I looked at it.

77
00:01:56,811 --> 00:01:57,300
Jowl.

78
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:57,661
How?

79
00:01:57,661 --> 00:01:58,021
Okay.

80
00:01:58,021 --> 00:01:58,854
How old was he?

81
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:01,500
What did he was told it was,

82
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:03,270
I thought he was like four or five.

83
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:04,740
I thought it was just like a little kid.

84
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:05,850
You know,

85
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:08,730
if we can get them can week
a film and recreate it,

86
00:02:08,731 --> 00:02:09,450
reenact it.

87
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:11,580
What exactly happened with awesome.

88
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,410
I met him once at the comedy store.

89
00:02:13,411 --> 00:02:14,400
He's a very nice guy.

90
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:16,383
Very nice guy.

91
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:17,320
He was very friendly.

92
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:17,940
Oh,

93
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:18,773
is he a nice guy?

94
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:19,081
Yeah,

95
00:02:19,081 --> 00:02:19,771
he was fine.

96
00:02:19,771 --> 00:02:20,160
He was,

97
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:20,311
well,

98
00:02:20,311 --> 00:02:23,450
you guys get killed.

99
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:25,380
The lovely tastes like sugar.

100
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:27,180
Yeah.

101
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,001
What did he tastes like?

102
00:02:28,001 --> 00:02:29,240
You remember what he tasted like?

103
00:02:29,241 --> 00:02:30,600
Belly button tastes like honey.

104
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:32,880
It's old spice.

105
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:35,340
I only feel bad when I
found out how old it was.

106
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,030
Like old spice

107
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:42,860
was baby gonna fucking stumble.

108
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:46,830
Babies got razor stubble and a tattoo.

109
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,500
Maybe he's got a heart on.

110
00:02:49,501 --> 00:02:51,750
What the fuck Michael
Jackson's glove on his ass.

111
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:57,370
[inaudible]

112
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:26,720
hello?

113
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,200
Hello?
