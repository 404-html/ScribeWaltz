1
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:06,870
And we're live. What's up dude? How
are you? Good, Joe, how are you?

2
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:12,060
Oh, very good. Good to see you. Um,
for folks who don't know the story,

3
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:15,200
uh,
Michael as he prefers to be discussing,

4
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:21,570
talk to as directed as
a referred to as you,

5
00:00:21,931 --> 00:00:25,010
uh,
you were a cop in Baltimore and you,

6
00:00:25,011 --> 00:00:28,690
you put a string of tweets
that, uh, I read, uh,

7
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:32,600
that was on Huffington Post. And, uh,

8
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:36,150
that's when I got interested in this
whole story because it's very rare that

9
00:00:36,151 --> 00:00:41,151
someone who's a cop comes out and tells
about all the shit that they experience.

10
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:44,450
Um, I have friends that are cops. Um,

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,860
and I know there's a lot
of good cops out there,

12
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:50,340
just like there's good everything,
you know, there's, you know,

13
00:00:50,341 --> 00:00:54,300
a Sam Harris and I'm Dan Carlin just
did a podcast recently together.

14
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:56,820
It's a really excellent podcasts. And one
of the things they were talking about,

15
00:00:56,821 --> 00:01:01,380
we were talking about people in power,
people that were our politicians,

16
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:05,040
that they, those are the whole
spectrum. You get great people,

17
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:09,660
people that are genuinely trying to do
good and you also get psychopaths. Um,

18
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:14,220
it seems like you ran into a
lot of fucking psychopaths.

19
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:18,420
How long were you a comp for?
I was a cop for 11 years.

20
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:22,310
But you look like you're 20. Thanks.
How's that possible? I don't know.

21
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,260
Good genetics, good genetics. And I guess
she did this trust didn't fuck with you.

22
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:30,590
It didn't really, really honest.
How did it not, my idea of, of,

23
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:35,000
uh, what an officer should be
was to be more robocop ish.

24
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:39,590
Like where I took my emotions out of
the job and handled it strictly as

25
00:01:39,591 --> 00:01:44,330
enforcing the law. So if I was spit on,
I realized they weren't spitting at me,

26
00:01:44,331 --> 00:01:46,460
they were spending at the uniform.
It was just irrelevant.

27
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:51,030
I understood it wasn't personal, so
I separate it. That as like a, a,

28
00:01:51,031 --> 00:01:53,000
a role maybe like I was acting.

29
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:57,050
That's a great attitude to
have, I guess. Um, uh, was it,

30
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:00,600
does that something that you thought
about before you became a cop or is it

31
00:02:00,601 --> 00:02:02,480
something you cultivated
while you were a cop?

32
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:05,730
I can't say for sure,
but it seems like,

33
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:08,190
I actually think that
was a wrong way to think.

34
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:12,090
But if you analyze it and you're
at that time, you think, well,

35
00:02:12,091 --> 00:02:15,270
how am I not going to be biased?
I'm not going to be biased by,

36
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:20,190
by separating myself from the situation
and kind of acting as autonomous.

37
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:21,180
Right.

38
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:25,980
But I think that that also made me blind
because if I was being blind to racism

39
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:30,240
than I was being blind to when we were
doing it, even if I wasn't doing it,

40
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:34,080
I wasn't seeing it when it occurred
either because I was really literally

41
00:02:34,081 --> 00:02:35,040
blinding myself to it.

42
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:38,230
So you're saying that if you
were blind to racism against you,

43
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:41,860
then you were also blind to cops
that were committing racism.

44
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:45,320
So if I looked at it as whether my,

45
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:50,270
whether I was talking to somebody of
Latino descent of black or whatever,

46
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,133
male,
female,

47
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:55,340
I looked at them just
as equally regardless.

48
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:57,200
So if you do that,

49
00:02:57,230 --> 00:03:02,140
then you don't see that
you're disproportionately
enforcing things against

50
00:03:02,141 --> 00:03:05,420
somebody because I'm literally
not trying to see that. Hmm.

51
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:09,340
So That's interesting.
So by,

52
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:12,550
by trying to treat everyone as equal,

53
00:03:12,551 --> 00:03:17,551
you weren't taking a count of how many
black people you were dealing with.

54
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:20,410
How many Latinos you were dealing with,
how many people of color,

55
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:22,630
how many minorities is
that fair assessment? Yeah,

56
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:25,970
it is fair to the extent that, I'll
admit that I, when I was in, uh,

57
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:27,290
in the eastern district,

58
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:32,000
I would intentionally lock white
people up so that I could make sure my,

59
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:35,480
my numbers weren't like, like my squad.
It wasn't like, oh my gosh, look,

60
00:03:35,481 --> 00:03:38,870
they look up 95% African Americans.
I didn't want to see that.

61
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,860
I wanted to see some kind of ballot.
So I was like aware that, hey,

62
00:03:42,861 --> 00:03:46,000
we're locking too many black
people up, but I don't think I, it,

63
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:49,310
it just didn't compute at the time.
It takes time for it to settle in.

64
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:52,820
So what about those poor white
people that you locked up on purpose?

65
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:57,390
I've got nothing to do with a guilty
at least. Yeah. Yeah, of course.

66
00:03:57,391 --> 00:03:59,800
I never locked the pay by, wasn't
guilty. Well, that's good. But you,

67
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:04,530
you experienced a lot of shit.
I mean, some of the things
that I read, um, that uh,

68
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,680
okay, here's one punting,
a handcuffed face down,

69
00:04:07,681 --> 00:04:10,230
suspect in the face after a foot chase.

70
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:16,280
I'm pissing and shitting inside suspects
homes during raids on their beds and

71
00:04:17,191 --> 00:04:22,191
close jacking up and illegally searching
thousands of people with no legal

72
00:04:22,531 --> 00:04:23,520
justification.

73
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:29,460
This is crazy, man. This
is crazy stuff. Well, when,

74
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,840
when you're doing it, it's
just what police do you know
it, you've seen it on TV,

75
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,280
you've seen it driving by.

76
00:04:35,281 --> 00:04:38,520
You've seen a corner full of black
guys with the cops searching them.

77
00:04:38,521 --> 00:04:40,800
You've seen him.
And when they're going into those pockets,

78
00:04:40,801 --> 00:04:45,270
you can't go into his pocket. You simply
can't. But we do. And not allowed to.

79
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:49,180
Right? You have no way of doing it
unless you're, you're getting a,

80
00:04:49,181 --> 00:04:50,610
a frisk where you have,

81
00:04:50,611 --> 00:04:54,090
you can justify Plainfield doctoring
and then you can get into the pocket.

82
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:56,420
But that's extremely rare.
I mean that,

83
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:59,190
that's a specific set of
circumstances under a Terry stop.

84
00:04:59,191 --> 00:05:01,290
And that's nothing that
you see Harry stop.

85
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,680
So Terry versus Ohio was a
case law that established,

86
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:06,500
I could be slightly
off on the particulars,

87
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:10,920
but if somebody was displaying the
characteristics of an armed person and you

88
00:05:10,921 --> 00:05:13,590
had suspicion or a hunch that
criminal activity was afoot,

89
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:16,680
you could stop that person.
And conduct a frisker the outer garments.

90
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:19,590
So how to garments, right? So
just the pat down essentially.

91
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,940
So the outer garments being
a jacket right at jacket.

92
00:05:23,941 --> 00:05:27,240
So if you had, if, if like you thought
there they had a weapon on their hip,

93
00:05:27,241 --> 00:05:29,700
you could pull back the jacket
and kind of pat it down.

94
00:05:29,701 --> 00:05:31,830
But it seems as the law is written,
it would have to,

95
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:35,220
you'd have to even like squish it and
it's just what you can touch from the

96
00:05:35,221 --> 00:05:35,860
outside.

97
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:40,120
So if you padded the outside of the jacket
and felt a gun that was in his waist,

98
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:43,860
then you could, you could arrest
him or take that gun, right?

99
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:47,020
You're perfectly fine, but you can't
dig in his pockets and look for crack.

100
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:50,910
Right? Well you can if you have
what that's playing field doctrine.

101
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:55,940
So if through my expertise I can tell
that that is packaging that is consistent

102
00:05:56,791 --> 00:05:58,070
with,
that are distributed

103
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:00,530
in the area and I can justify that,

104
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,430
then I can go and retrieve those
narcotics that that's an extremely,

105
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:05,960
I mean if you can just think about that.

106
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:10,910
How do I really know that that bag in
your pocket is marijuana, not Oregano.

107
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:14,360
It's, it's I, I don't, I'm not sure if
that should be legally justified or not.

108
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,930
So that stop and Frisk Shit that
they were doing in New York,

109
00:06:17,931 --> 00:06:19,880
they're not doing that anymore,
right? Isn't that the deal?

110
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,870
We talked about that on a podcast once we,

111
00:06:21,871 --> 00:06:25,580
we went over all the times that it was
just innocent people and it's fucking

112
00:06:25,581 --> 00:06:29,600
staggering. It's disgusting. That stopped.
They would just be able to pull white,

113
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:32,390
I mean, black kids. I said, why
kids? Not really though. Right.

114
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:36,080
It was mostly black kids. They would just
be able to pull them over and go, hey,

115
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:37,490
let me,
let me check you,

116
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:42,050
and they would just check their bodies
and most of the time they were innocent.

117
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,660
Most of the time there
was nothing to check for.

118
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:50,190
I'm going to tell you that 99.99999%
of them have nothing on them because

119
00:06:50,441 --> 00:06:54,260
they're not even usually documented.
So in Baltimore will do stop and Frisk,

120
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:55,631
stop and Frisk.

121
00:06:55,631 --> 00:06:59,650
You have to conduct an entire specific
report called a stop and Frisk report

122
00:06:59,651 --> 00:07:03,670
that justifies everything you did and,
and so it's a big pain.

123
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:07,120
So no one's going to write that.
So they just do it and they move on.

124
00:07:07,121 --> 00:07:10,270
So your stance or any
style you see as junk, so,

125
00:07:10,271 --> 00:07:11,830
and the stats that you see that are junk,

126
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:14,770
sit there and say one in a thousand
actually have something on them.

127
00:07:14,771 --> 00:07:16,240
So think about what reality is

128
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,930
Jesus. Um, what,

129
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:25,080
what led to you leaving the police
force and was this a buildup?

130
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,700
W was it something that you
thought about for a long time?

131
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:30,520
Hey, ready? Laugh. Yes. Okay.

132
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:35,740
We had a shooting range in the
basement of the eastern district.

133
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:40,840
We had to move something. Uh, we had
to put one desk on top of another desk.

134
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:42,400
It's slipped and I tore my shoulder out.

135
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:46,140
There's your exciting story for why
I left. That's it. That's it. What,

136
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:49,970
what was the injury? I had my shorter
reconstruct. It just tore at Tor. I,

137
00:07:49,971 --> 00:07:52,420
it's where everything out and had to put
it back together. I'm like, what? What?

138
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:58,840
No Mountain. So the rotator cuff,
not rotator cuff. And so the,

139
00:07:59,020 --> 00:07:59,500
the uh,

140
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:03,520
cartilage that folds over just doesn't
hold it into place anymore so it can come

141
00:08:03,521 --> 00:08:05,320
out easily.
So if it can come out easily,

142
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:08,500
they don't let you be a cop anymore
and they process it can come out easily

143
00:08:08,501 --> 00:08:09,334
right now.
Yeah.

144
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:13,660
So it's permanent forever department and
it's fucked up from moving a desk? Yes.

145
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:18,400
All the paradigms. The story.
I've got nothing. I have nothing.

146
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:23,770
Um, so you left and then you
decide how long ago was this?

147
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:29,850
I got injured in like late 2009
but it took time to do the surgery.

148
00:08:30,161 --> 00:08:32,170
He's trying to come back.
I mean I tried to come back.

149
00:08:32,171 --> 00:08:36,040
I came back and I was going code it
to a call with lights and sirens.

150
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:38,890
Went to turn down a street
and the shoulder popped out.

151
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:42,400
So I went up onto the sidewalk is I
had to grab it with the other hand and

152
00:08:42,401 --> 00:08:45,550
that's when I had to go back in and then
they said I need another surgery is not

153
00:08:45,551 --> 00:08:49,060
doing another surgery. So
from a fucking turn. Wow.

154
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,320
Fuck Cain Velasquez,

155
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:56,040
surgeon fixed that dude up.
Pretty good I guess. Um,

156
00:08:56,250 --> 00:09:00,330
so you decided once you were out,
once you knew you were out,

157
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,230
you'd done the surgery,
you,

158
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:04,800
you couldn't be a police officer
anymore cause you shoulder blows out.

159
00:09:04,801 --> 00:09:07,080
What made you decide to go
public with all this stuff?

160
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:12,220
Well I've actually talked about this
for a long time. Um, when I have,

161
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:15,970
we had a lot of local media and a local
street reporters and stuff like that

162
00:09:15,971 --> 00:09:19,630
that I was friends with on Twitter and
we would talk about these things for the

163
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:21,400
last couple of years. We would just go
back and forth talking about things.

164
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:24,580
And I had no idea that
anybody would pick up on this.

165
00:09:24,581 --> 00:09:28,000
I thought I was just going to be talking
to the same reporters in the same local

166
00:09:28,001 --> 00:09:29,890
group of people that I've been
talking to the whole time.

167
00:09:29,891 --> 00:09:32,620
So I came back and saw that
somebody started paying attention.

168
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:36,080
And what was that like
for you? Shocking. Yeah,

169
00:09:36,081 --> 00:09:40,340
we were talking about it before the
show started. This new found notoriety.

170
00:09:40,341 --> 00:09:43,580
How weird it is.
Like describe it.

171
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,170
Uh,
when we landed in La,

172
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:50,550
guy asked if I was on TV talking about
police and it's like, I don't know,

173
00:09:50,551 --> 00:09:54,660
I'm used to being anonymous.
So I'm used to just going in,

174
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:57,270
minding my own business
and not bothering anybody.

175
00:09:57,271 --> 00:10:00,360
And then suddenly people know who you
are. It's, it's, it's, it's awkward.

176
00:10:00,361 --> 00:10:01,980
And especially for what they know you are,

177
00:10:01,981 --> 00:10:06,150
because every time now a cop looks at
me, I'm like, yeah, it's, it's going to,

178
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:11,070
I'm the bad guy now,
so I can't trust them as well.

179
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:14,550
It makes it kind of a, I'm kind
of stuck in a, in a weird place.

180
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:18,540
So when this most recent Baltimore,
uh,

181
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,450
incident took place,
the Freddie gray incident,

182
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:26,690
the eruption of public attention on
police brutality in Baltimore and the

183
00:10:27,871 --> 00:10:30,600
marches and all the new stories,

184
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,230
then people start really paying
attention to you. Is that fair to,

185
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:36,060
yeah. I mean, it seems
like that was the case.

186
00:10:36,061 --> 00:10:39,810
I maybe somebody had followed me before
and somebody with a powerful retweet.

187
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:40,830
I have no idea.

188
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:45,950
And so what was the, explain how it all
went down. Like how did you become this

189
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,930
public figure?
I mean,

190
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:51,290
I literally have no
comprehension of what happened.

191
00:10:51,291 --> 00:10:55,670
I decided that I was just going to talk
about some of the things we do so that

192
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:59,150
it's like, look, this is what we do. Let's
not try to pretend that we don't do it.

193
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:00,013
We do it.

194
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:05,200
So it's not about whether we're going
to blame the cops that did it or whether

195
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:07,130
we're going to go back
and have retribution.

196
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:10,850
We need to realize that this
is what we do. Stop denying it.

197
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,250
The black community has been
lying for the last 50 years.

198
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:17,420
We need to fix it and in a realistic
scientific way and where we have some

199
00:11:17,421 --> 00:11:19,730
empathy and treat people like
human beings because we don't,

200
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:24,580
what is Baltimore like to someone whom I,
my buddy,

201
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:28,500
my buddy John Rollo lives in
Baltimore. Shout out to John Rollo. Um,

202
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:31,970
he loves to the podcasts all the time.
And the way he describes it is,

203
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:36,860
I mean I've been there a few times for
the UFC, but uh, I haven't, you know,

204
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:41,630
gone into the bad neighborhoods.
I didn't wash the wire. So,

205
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:44,420
but watching this,

206
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,680
this whole incident and seeing these
people talk about how many times they've

207
00:11:48,681 --> 00:11:52,490
been arrested and how many times they've
been fucked over by cops and how crazy

208
00:11:52,491 --> 00:11:54,130
it is there and how much
crime there was there

209
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:55,540
and how much violence there is there.
Um,

210
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:58,750
what it's like trying to grow up there
and become a normal person and what a

211
00:11:58,751 --> 00:12:03,220
fucking uphill struggle that is described
Baltimore to somebody like me. Okay.

212
00:12:03,221 --> 00:12:06,700
So Baltimore,
like anywhere else is largely good,

213
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:10,540
but it has a microcosm of it.

214
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:14,380
It's like the prototype
for the prison cycle.

215
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:18,490
So somebody comes up in a neighborhood
and they just have no hope and they keep

216
00:12:18,491 --> 00:12:23,320
feeding that school to prison cycle over
and over and over again and has a deep

217
00:12:23,321 --> 00:12:25,750
history in Baltimore.
So it invades everything.

218
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:30,850
So whether you're talking about are the
things that police do or whether you're

219
00:12:30,851 --> 00:12:35,230
talking about where they live in
Baltimore, the, you have clusters,

220
00:12:35,231 --> 00:12:38,020
so you'll have a, a black neighborhood
here, a black neighborhood here,

221
00:12:38,021 --> 00:12:41,320
black neighbor here, white money, white
money, white money, low income white,

222
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:42,640
and it's in these clusters.

223
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:47,500
But these clusters were intentionally
formed by the law, uh, in Baltimore.

224
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:50,050
I can't even say how long ago,
maybe a hundred years ago.

225
00:12:50,051 --> 00:12:54,580
And you still have deeds now that say
you can't sell the house to an African

226
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:57,940
American person. So like even if you
were a doctor there, you couldn't,

227
00:12:57,941 --> 00:12:58,810
if you were a black doctor,

228
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:02,050
you couldn't buy a house in Nice
white neighborhood six years ago.

229
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:06,100
So you had to still go buy a house in
that little area and that if you're,

230
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:07,810
if you're a clustering,
everybody like that,

231
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:11,350
it just pulls everybody down constantly.
Constantly, constantly. It's like, it's,

232
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:15,760
they're just constantly beat down.
There's just no way out. So 60 years ago,

233
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:16,630
60 years ago,

234
00:13:16,631 --> 00:13:19,780
you couldn't buy a house if you were
a black guy in certain neighborhoods.

235
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:23,050
And it was a law.
They had this on that it wasn't a deeds.

236
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,960
There's still some of the
deed still have it still. Why?

237
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:29,260
They know court's gonna uphold it,
but you'll still see it.

238
00:13:29,261 --> 00:13:32,050
You'll see it in there.
So you'll see the language.

239
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,110
So if there's a white neighborhood today,
there's,

240
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:38,800
there's a possibility that some black
person who wants to move into this white

241
00:13:38,801 --> 00:13:41,680
neighborhood might encounter
some resistance because of this.

242
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:43,060
I don't know if they're
going to count a resistance,

243
00:13:43,061 --> 00:13:45,190
but they're going to see it in the deed
that's going to make you feel awkward.

244
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:50,180
Fuck. Why is it still in their
cases, the original deed?

245
00:13:50,181 --> 00:13:53,380
They keep carrying it over. Know why
wouldn't they change that? I don't know.

246
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:56,620
I don't,
I have no idea why this city is that way,

247
00:13:56,621 --> 00:13:59,410
why these people did these things.
It doesn't make sense.

248
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:03,580
Nobody stood up objectively and we
created these racist institutions. I mean,

249
00:14:03,581 --> 00:14:06,220
they are institutional racism.
There's no doubt about it.

250
00:14:06,221 --> 00:14:09,520
And it's up and down in these urban
environments and these cities, Cleveland,

251
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:13,150
Ferguson, Baltimore, Atlanta, it's
irrelevant. They're all the same.

252
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:17,770
All these urban environment and there's
all over Compton, watts. And go would,

253
00:14:17,771 --> 00:14:22,270
there's a ton of places like that in
La as well. It's all over the world.

254
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,130
I mean all over the United
States I should say.

255
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:27,180
There's neighborhoods like that
that seem almost inescapable.

256
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:30,430
Digitas and the Malmo on
radio lab. Yes, I did. Okay.

257
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:32,270
You know how long back
that gives me think.

258
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:35,620
I mean this is so we're
denying that we have this so,

259
00:14:35,621 --> 00:14:38,200
so well people are saying
these cops aren't racist.

260
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:41,440
Not saying they are racist when I'm
telling you is they're participating in

261
00:14:41,441 --> 00:14:42,670
institutionalized racism.

262
00:14:42,671 --> 00:14:47,020
Just like everybody in Britain was doing
back in Kenya with the mouse however

263
00:14:47,021 --> 00:14:49,470
long ago that was. That was
a long time ago. And you're,

264
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:52,550
you're seeing it come out
how it's just the whole

265
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:54,890
thing. If you're participating
in it, you're guilty.

266
00:14:54,891 --> 00:14:57,370
And that's what I'm telling you.
I'm guilty. I participated in it.

267
00:14:57,590 --> 00:15:01,070
It is there a way to fix it?
Well,

268
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:05,570
the easy thing from the police thing
is I think empathy is number one.

269
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:08,900
We had to start treating human
beings like they're human beings.

270
00:15:08,901 --> 00:15:13,901
We have to like we just arrest them and
you throw him in a cage just like they

271
00:15:13,941 --> 00:15:18,941
did with Freddie Gray and you don't
focus on them being somebody's child or,

272
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:22,610
or, or, or your, I mean,
race is a social construct.

273
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:26,120
This is my brother and I'm doing
this to him. Eventually just doesn't,

274
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,620
it's inconceivable.

275
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:30,970
Um,
uh,

276
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:35,970
W we've had this conversation a hundred
times in this podcast where I have

277
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:40,840
always wondered why is it that we put
so much emphasis in trying to repair

278
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:45,910
damage that we've done in other countries.
So much emphasis in nation building,

279
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:51,130
so much emphasis in invading places
because of whatever perceived threat or

280
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:54,550
whatever natural resource we
want to dominate and monopolize.

281
00:15:54,551 --> 00:15:59,551
But no emphasis whatsoever in
fixing our own inner cities.

282
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:04,740
No emphasis whatsoever and fixing the
ghettos and just constructing social

283
00:16:05,081 --> 00:16:09,520
center is giving people places that are
safe to go to and somehow or another

284
00:16:09,521 --> 00:16:11,090
educating people and, and, and,

285
00:16:11,091 --> 00:16:16,091
and lifting them out one by one out of
the fucking constant cycle that they're

286
00:16:16,811 --> 00:16:21,811
in this never ending cycle of poverty
and crime and being surrounded by it.

287
00:16:22,631 --> 00:16:27,100
Man, you, everyone knows that
people imitate their atmosphere.

288
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:30,100
It's just a part of being a human being.
That's why accents exists.

289
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:33,850
That's why people in some parts of the
world do weird things because everyone

290
00:16:33,851 --> 00:16:35,350
around them does it. Like, you know,

291
00:16:35,351 --> 00:16:39,190
weird clothes that they
wear a weird rituals,

292
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:43,630
scarring of their face. You
know, what have you, that
we imitate what's around us.

293
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:47,560
And when you're around a lot of fucking
crime and you grow up around a lot of

294
00:16:47,561 --> 00:16:51,520
fucking crime and a lot of people
with records, criminal records,

295
00:16:51,521 --> 00:16:55,630
and it becomes normal. And I don't
know how to fix that and I don't,

296
00:16:55,720 --> 00:17:00,720
I don't see any effort whatsoever in
really engineering some sort of a solution

297
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:07,240
to what these poor,
unfortunate people are born into.

298
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:11,410
Well, for police it's even worse because
we're perpetuating that situation.

299
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:14,320
So work,
we're the ones doing that cycle.

300
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:18,340
So when we see a 61 time I was a shift
commander in the eastern district and I'm

301
00:17:18,341 --> 00:17:22,360
telling my guys,
stop pulling over old white ladies.

302
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:25,810
Stop pulling over that young cute girl.
Stop.

303
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:29,740
We focus on who committed the crimes
and who commit the crimes. In Baltimore,

304
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:32,770
16 to 24 year old black males.
That's who's committing the crimes.

305
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:35,440
So focus on them.
That makes sense.

306
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:40,810
Until you complete the cycle and realize
that you started doing that because of

307
00:17:40,811 --> 00:17:44,230
institutionalized racism
in your organization.

308
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:48,070
And so when you are jacking up those
guys in the corner and you do find that

309
00:17:48,071 --> 00:17:51,600
dime bag, so sent him to jail, now
he can't go to work the next day.

310
00:17:51,601 --> 00:17:54,060
So he loses his job and then
he can't make it to court.

311
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:58,410
So he gets his license suspended and then
he's driving and then you are focusing

312
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:01,620
on those 1624 black male. So now
you're more likely to pull them over.

313
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:04,170
Now you pull him over.
Now he has a suspended license.

314
00:18:04,171 --> 00:18:07,950
Now he gets his license is revoked and
now he can't get to the job legally and

315
00:18:07,951 --> 00:18:11,970
you just, and now, now he's dealt. It's
left with selling drugs on the corner.

316
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:14,220
So you were were creating it.

317
00:18:14,221 --> 00:18:17,910
We have to step back and realize what
the facts are and what we're doing.

318
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,830
And then the number one
problem is the drug war.

319
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:21,540
And then we have money in politics.

320
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:25,950
Those are our two big issues that we have
to solve before we get anywhere. Well,

321
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:28,050
what does the money in
politics has a player.

322
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:33,410
So I don't think we can change anything
until we stopped having politicians that

323
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:39,120
are serving their donors
versus serving the people.

324
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:43,500
So somebody that's talking like me is
never going to run a police agency as long

325
00:18:43,501 --> 00:18:45,630
as all their corporate donors
are saying, no, no, no.

326
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:48,180
You keep those animals and the cages
because that's what they do. I mean,

327
00:18:48,181 --> 00:18:51,420
that's a good joke in Baltimore that
police are actually the zookeepers.

328
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,640
She keeps everything in it. Don't
let it hit the county. So, so that's,

329
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,340
that's our role.
That's what we're doing.

330
00:18:56,490 --> 00:19:00,690
So your mayors and your politicians are
going to continue to encourage that.

331
00:19:00,691 --> 00:19:03,210
They're not going to take a risk and say,
all right,

332
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:07,770
how do we lower juvenile possession of
marijuana? You know that I know you do.

333
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:12,600
You know you legalize it. Yeah. And you
control it. And rates actually go down.

334
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:14,730
Whether we're overseas
or were in Colorado,

335
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:18,780
your possession rates for marijuana
will go down among juveniles.

336
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:19,890
But we don't do that.

337
00:19:19,891 --> 00:19:23,460
We keep looking at everything like we're
hammer searching for nouns and we keep

338
00:19:23,461 --> 00:19:25,800
looking for what we're
going to hit to stop it.

339
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:29,640
Instead of standing back and using science
and figuring out what are we actually

340
00:19:29,641 --> 00:19:32,730
going to do to fix this problem,
what we'll actually have results.

341
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:36,940
This is a very rare to hear
a cop talk like this. I'm,

342
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:40,440
I'm really happy that you're coming
forward and speaking like this,

343
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:46,130
but how many people that were with you
in the police force or upset about this?

344
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,780
My closest friends,
I think understanding.

345
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:55,590
I think the vast majority is upset with
me and they're going to be upset with me

346
00:19:55,591 --> 00:19:58,770
because what I'm really trying to do
is take power away from them. I mean,

347
00:19:58,771 --> 00:19:59,191
I really am.

348
00:19:59,191 --> 00:20:01,920
I'm trying to take power from them and
give it back to the people because we're

349
00:20:01,921 --> 00:20:03,000
supposed to be serving them.

350
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:06,780
We're not supposed to be this occupying
force and this pretty little white boy

351
00:20:06,781 --> 00:20:09,540
from the county looks like an
occupying force in the city.

352
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:14,220
There's no way around it, so I have to
be aware of that and think about that.

353
00:20:14,221 --> 00:20:17,100
Think about what I'm doing.
Not being an occupying force,

354
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:21,150
essentially actually go out of my way
to lift up a situation to deescalate it

355
00:20:21,151 --> 00:20:23,910
and do better than the, come in there
and be like, you're going to jail,

356
00:20:23,911 --> 00:20:26,610
you're going to jail. Shut up, let's
go. Which is what I did for a long time.

357
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:29,610
So when you say the county,
what does that mean?

358
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:34,410
When you say white boy from the county.
What's the county? So the suburbs,

359
00:20:34,411 --> 00:20:36,610
so in Baltimore it's kind of weird.
It's a little different.

360
00:20:36,611 --> 00:20:39,630
So Baltimore's incorporate it.
So has nothing to do with the county.

361
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,250
So there's like this hard line.

362
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:46,050
So it's not lawyer and then the county
of Baltimore County. Oh, okay. Right.

363
00:20:46,051 --> 00:20:49,570
So you have the city by itself.
So here in Los Angeles,

364
00:20:49,571 --> 00:20:53,530
do you think you have marina Delray, you
have Inglewood. You have all this stuff.

365
00:20:53,531 --> 00:20:56,740
Is Is La in Baltimore?
It's just Baltimore.

366
00:20:56,830 --> 00:21:01,120
So everything is concentrated and focused.
And me coming from the county,

367
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,450
I've never spent any time
in the city growing up.

368
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:09,490
I come in just as straight from the
Marine Corps that's ready to roll.

369
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,960
We're going to do our thing.
Uh,

370
00:21:10,961 --> 00:21:13,510
I'm going to put on a different
uniform and continue my war.

371
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:17,940
Wow. So that was, that
was why he became a cop.

372
00:21:17,941 --> 00:21:21,660
So you came right from the military
and it just seemed like a logical

373
00:21:21,661 --> 00:21:22,120
progression.

374
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:22,931
It's a logical progression.

375
00:21:22,931 --> 00:21:26,740
I think I went into the Marine Corps
to prepare myself. I was a little, uh,

376
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:32,530
uncontrolled and decided to go into the
Marine Corps to get my shit together and

377
00:21:32,531 --> 00:21:35,140
discipline mass if I could get into the
police department and everything would

378
00:21:35,141 --> 00:21:36,490
be,
and that was my always my goal.

379
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:39,810
So your goal was always to be a
police officer, right. Why was that?

380
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:41,810
I Dunno. Said it since
I was a little kid. Uh,

381
00:21:41,811 --> 00:21:46,020
I think you go in with these grandiose
ideas that you're going to help people

382
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:50,100
and, and maybe that's why I talk.
I mean, it's still evolving then I,

383
00:21:50,101 --> 00:21:51,350
then I'm saying these things,
so you're,

384
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,090
you're bringing up a point
and maybe that's why I taught.

385
00:21:53,091 --> 00:21:58,050
Maybe I feel that I wasn't doing
what I actually set out to do.

386
00:21:58,051 --> 00:22:00,030
I was actually exacerbating the situation.

387
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:03,330
So you got caught up
in the cycle yourself.

388
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:07,410
The cycle of law enforcement and the
way law enforcement behaves in Baltimore

389
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,000
and it just became habitual.

390
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:14,060
Totally. You don't think about it, you
just ignore it. So when I say that, uh,

391
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:18,100
I had that suspect that I chased and the
guy comes up and kicks him in the face.

392
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:22,300
I think to myself, God, that
guy is a fucking asshole,

393
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:26,320
but not me.
I didn't do it right.

394
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:29,980
But I have the responsibility
to do something there.

395
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:33,340
That was an assault on an innocent victim.
It's not as bad as McKinney,

396
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:37,660
but it's assault on an innocent victim
that I should have certainly stepped up

397
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:42,320
and done something about it. It's just,
you were, you were in it. You don't it,

398
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:48,130
I can't explain it how you don't see it
until you've really just start to slowly

399
00:22:48,131 --> 00:22:50,710
step back and say,
what are we doing here?

400
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:54,920
We're starting to see more and more,
um,

401
00:22:56,740 --> 00:23:01,490
videotapes s police stories of,
of police brutality.

402
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:06,730
Do you think this is just a result of
cell phones or is the violence escalating

403
00:23:07,131 --> 00:23:08,840
or is the violence always
been there like this,

404
00:23:08,841 --> 00:23:10,520
but people are finally
finding out about it?

405
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:14,610
I think it's actually deescalating
the violence. Yeah, I think you're,

406
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:17,750
I think your cell phones are
certainly scaring a lot of cops from,

407
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:22,710
from doing things. But the only variable
here is the proliferation of videos,

408
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:27,600
a video cameras. So as you get more and
more cameras, you're seeing more and more.

409
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:31,860
But imagine what it was like before the
camera's cops know the cameras are there.

410
00:23:31,861 --> 00:23:33,090
We've known it for a long time.

411
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:38,480
So like we have pole cameras in
Baltimore and so if we were going to do

412
00:23:39,301 --> 00:23:40,011
something on,

413
00:23:40,011 --> 00:23:42,720
so there's a street called monument street
that's full of these cameras that are

414
00:23:42,721 --> 00:23:46,070
monitored by the city. So
as an officer, I always knew

415
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:48,800
that if I was on that street,
I kind of had to behave in a,

416
00:23:48,801 --> 00:23:51,050
in a different manner because
I knew the camera was there.

417
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:54,220
Now we know that the camera's
there all the time, so it's,

418
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:57,680
it's gotta be much smaller.
Well, there's always these guys,

419
00:23:57,681 --> 00:23:59,930
they say that you can't even
believe they're real humans.

420
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:01,760
Like that fucking cop and Texas.

421
00:24:01,761 --> 00:24:04,280
It showed up at the pool party
and did the fucking role.

422
00:24:04,281 --> 00:24:08,240
Like he's Paul Blart Mall Cop.
Holy fucking shit.

423
00:24:08,241 --> 00:24:11,590
When you find out that that's a real
person, you just like, wait. So,

424
00:24:11,610 --> 00:24:12,920
so think about that situation.

425
00:24:12,921 --> 00:24:17,090
So that's the McKinney situation where
you have a guy assaulting a 14 year old

426
00:24:17,091 --> 00:24:21,230
girl and that chief still comes
out and still he has that blinder,

427
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:25,430
that blue blinder where he's
saying there's 11 good cops
there. My ass, there are,

428
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:27,020
there are 12 bad cops there.

429
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:30,500
Cause he just witnessed an assault on a
14 year old girl in a bathing suit and

430
00:24:30,501 --> 00:24:33,470
did shit about it.
So you have 12 bad cops.

431
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:37,670
But the reason why I'm talking is because
I do think there's 11 other ones can

432
00:24:37,671 --> 00:24:38,420
be spoken to.

433
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:41,480
I think the guy that comes up and pats
him on the back then it was like, Yo,

434
00:24:41,481 --> 00:24:42,920
what are you doing?
Why is your gun out?

435
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:47,420
If we keep talking to him then maybe he'll
be able to go talk to two more people

436
00:24:47,421 --> 00:24:49,910
maybe who realized what he's doing.
And we can kind of,

437
00:24:49,911 --> 00:24:54,770
at least on a grass roots level kind
of changed what police think they're

438
00:24:54,771 --> 00:24:57,530
supposed to be versus what we are.

439
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:02,780
We've talked about it on the podcast
many times that I think that it's one of

440
00:25:02,781 --> 00:25:06,020
the most difficult jobs
that a person can do.

441
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:11,230
And one of the jobs that has the least
amount of respect cops like almost

442
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:16,790
routinely are treated with
disrespect and also they're there.

443
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,630
No one,
no one thinks about PTSD for cops.

444
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,050
People think about it all the time when
it comes to soldiers is become much more

445
00:25:24,051 --> 00:25:27,730
in the public eye.
But the amount of stress that's,

446
00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:30,830
that's a part of being a police officer.
What does that,

447
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:33,890
like when you're going into these bad
neighborhoods and you're dealing with

448
00:25:33,891 --> 00:25:35,240
murder,
when you're dealing with

449
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:41,770
all sorts of different assaults and
domestic violence and theft and robbery,

450
00:25:41,901 --> 00:25:46,580
like what is that like to be a person who
deals with that every day and how much

451
00:25:46,581 --> 00:25:50,330
of a factor does that play in
these people snapping on people?

452
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:56,220
This is hard for me to say because
I don't feel like I had that. Um,

453
00:25:56,690 --> 00:25:59,320
I did not find the job
stressful on the streets. Uh,

454
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:03,050
the greatest enemy was from within.
Uh, they say that and then to watch,

455
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:04,340
don't worry about street.

456
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:07,550
You got to worry about what the other
officers are doing. I missed that too.

457
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,610
I thought it was good. Yeah,
that was good. It was a, the,

458
00:26:10,611 --> 00:26:14,330
the banter back and forth and then movie
is very realistic of what cops act like.

459
00:26:14,331 --> 00:26:15,860
You think cops are all professional,

460
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:19,430
but we're sitting in the car talking
about the same things and anybody else

461
00:26:19,431 --> 00:26:22,620
talks about and then you're, oh shit,
something's going on mostly pussy, right?

462
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:27,610
Yeah. Anyway, so where were we?

463
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:30,730
We were talking about how
stressful it is. Right? It's not,

464
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:34,310
it wasn't stressful for me. Are
you a Weirdo? I don't think so.

465
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:37,670
I think I built up that wall and
to do other people have that wall.

466
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:42,140
Not all of them. I knew some of them
handled things, uh, more personally.

467
00:26:42,141 --> 00:26:46,140
So they take, I don't think
we want those people as cops.

468
00:26:46,141 --> 00:26:49,710
I understand it's hard for them. I get
that. But the job's not for anybody.

469
00:26:49,711 --> 00:26:53,190
You're absolutely right. When you say
the job is nearly impossible. I think it,

470
00:26:53,390 --> 00:26:55,200
it is impossible to do.
Right?

471
00:26:55,680 --> 00:27:00,480
So that's why we have to be more human so
that when we screw up, we can say, look,

472
00:27:00,481 --> 00:27:02,040
I screwed up and this is why.

473
00:27:02,041 --> 00:27:05,970
And people will understand where you're
coming from. Whereas with Freddie Gray,

474
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:08,730
we obviously screwed up.
There's no way around this,

475
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,490
but yet we still come out and be like,
oh, but we don't know anything. We're to,

476
00:27:11,491 --> 00:27:15,060
the facts are out bullshit. You had
somebody in your possession and he's dead,

477
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:16,860
stopped denying it.
No.

478
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:20,670
What was all the bullshit about him having
a neck injury that turned out to not

479
00:27:20,671 --> 00:27:22,590
be true? Right. That's
how it was all bullshit.

480
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:25,110
Was it just something somebody made up
online? Is that what you would think?

481
00:27:25,111 --> 00:27:28,980
He had an old car accident or something
like that and the case had some kind of

482
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:32,010
final disposition that was entered into
the court records, but it was that,

483
00:27:32,011 --> 00:27:33,600
it was harking back to
something a long time ago.

484
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:38,660
So he died from being slammed up against
the wall inside the back of a paddy

485
00:27:39,271 --> 00:27:43,620
wagon. Right. So that's what happened.
And what was he arrested for? Okay,

486
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:46,750
so let's think about, let's
put this in real terms. Okay.

487
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:51,690
Police always want to put things in legal
terms, but you're in a high drug area.

488
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:54,900
Uh,
lieutenant sees Freddie Gray,

489
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:59,340
well allegedly sees Freddie gray
recognize him, turn and run.

490
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:05,190
So they chase, they follow him,
they catch him, they searched him.

491
00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:09,750
And do we have a stop and Frisk? No,
they didn't document a stop and Frisk.

492
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,630
So because he's running,
does that mean that he,

493
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:16,650
there's these suspicious.
So believe it or not,

494
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:21,420
the law says that that's fine, that
you can chase him and you can stop him.

495
00:28:21,810 --> 00:28:23,730
So my immediate objection with that case,

496
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:26,970
I don't know why I can't think of it
off top of my head, but that case,

497
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:30,870
there's no clarification on how
much force is allowed to be used.

498
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:34,800
So in a stop and Frisk, you can actually
use a, a legitimate amount of force.

499
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:36,940
But in that situation,
the running, I don't,

500
00:28:36,941 --> 00:28:39,210
I don't really know how much
force is allowed to be used there.

501
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,800
So I was curious how much force they use.

502
00:28:40,801 --> 00:28:44,040
But apparently they didn't use that much
force and they searched him and they

503
00:28:44,041 --> 00:28:47,730
got a knife out of his pocket.
So let's stop at this knife.

504
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:52,590
Now how do we get into the knife?
We searched it went into his pocket.

505
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,630
We don't have, we don't have
a stop and Frisk. Right?

506
00:28:54,631 --> 00:28:57,690
But even if you can somehow
justify that the knife that he has,

507
00:28:57,691 --> 00:29:00,090
his only illegal if it
has an internal spring.

508
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:04,020
So how could you feel whether it had an
eternal spring or not and how many white

509
00:29:04,021 --> 00:29:06,270
people do you think carry a
knife on the internal spring?

510
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:09,900
It's going to be the same amount. But
do any of them ever get arrested? Never.

511
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:12,810
The internal spring.
So fucking stupid.

512
00:29:12,811 --> 00:29:17,310
They have thumb releases for knives now
that are easier than a switch blade.

513
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,180
The whole thing is stupid.
So why do you create a law like that?

514
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:25,290
You create a law like that because you
can fuck with the people that you want to

515
00:29:25,291 --> 00:29:25,950
fuck with.

516
00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:29,260
That's why we do it because they saw
west side story and something like that.

517
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:32,700
Switch plates back and then
now everybody's scared to
switch late in high school.

518
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:35,900
I thought it was a bad ass, but then
I realized like it's just a knife,

519
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:40,230
a regular knife. It's like a better
tool. Like that switch plates,

520
00:29:40,231 --> 00:29:42,460
fucking stupid spring

521
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:47,370
breaks, it folds up. So this
guy had a switchblade, is that,

522
00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:50,430
well, well we haven't seen
the knife yet, but by we have,

523
00:29:50,431 --> 00:29:53,280
they don't even mean a switchblade
with they're saying is,

524
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:55,830
so you have an assistant
so you have a flip out.

525
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:58,050
You know how some of them you have
to use your whole force, right?

526
00:29:58,051 --> 00:30:02,910
And so some of them are assistant and
assistant pocket knife. It's this big,

527
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:04,950
it was illegal in Baltimore.

528
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:10,080
But I assure you that everybody that's
been arrested with that is 98% going to

529
00:30:10,081 --> 00:30:13,530
be black.
So the users and excuse absolutely.

530
00:30:13,531 --> 00:30:16,080
So we can fuck with who we want to
fuck with. It's exactly what we did.

531
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:20,000
So his knife was essentially
like a utility knife that
people might have in that

532
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:23,040
if you live in a hood [inaudible]
probably you might have an iPhone yet.

533
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:25,620
Probably a good idea. Yeah.
So if I would've called him,

534
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:27,960
well I would probably chased him
because I think he was dealing,

535
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:31,230
I would have chased him. Right.
But I would have stopped him.

536
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:33,870
He didn't have the drugs on
him. He wins. I searched him.

537
00:30:33,871 --> 00:30:36,360
I probably do take out the knife, but
I give it back to him and I say, okay,

538
00:30:36,361 --> 00:30:39,960
be safe. Sorry about that. And we're
good. We're playing the game. We know.

539
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:44,550
Did it bug you that you were looking
for drugs? Did that ever like go,

540
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:45,810
what the fuck am I doing?

541
00:30:45,811 --> 00:30:50,010
Being some sort of a glorified
revenue collector for the state,

542
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:53,760
pulling people over and g for drugs.

543
00:30:54,810 --> 00:30:55,890
Yeah,
you're totally right.

544
00:30:55,920 --> 00:31:00,090
There is no point in any consensual
daughter grievance to fight against them.

545
00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:05,160
But, but my whole point is to
keep it real. It was fucking fun.

546
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:09,630
It was fun. It was fucking great fun
to catch him. I live for the car chase.

547
00:31:09,631 --> 00:31:11,250
I mean,
you think about this,

548
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:15,320
think about if you're in a police car
and you have the lights and sirens and

549
00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:17,730
you're going down like coastal highway,

550
00:31:17,731 --> 00:31:20,160
or you're going down your favorite
one oh one or whatever it is,

551
00:31:20,161 --> 00:31:22,380
and you're gone through your side
roads and you're chasing this guy.

552
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:26,820
There is no adrenaline rush.
It's ever compared to that.
It you live for it. It's,

553
00:31:26,821 --> 00:31:31,750
it's incredible. It's amazing.
And you don't really, I,

554
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:36,300
I didn't really care why gimme the
car chase. It was, it was amazing.

555
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:38,330
That's so refreshing.
The honest.

556
00:31:38,331 --> 00:31:41,060
I'm so glad you're talking like this
because I always thought that too.

557
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:44,090
I was felt like they, it must be exciting
for them. Like a fucking is amazing.

558
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,920
Cheetah chasing the gazelle.

559
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:49,230
Right? Well, it's a three good stories
we could tell later on that. I mean,

560
00:31:49,231 --> 00:31:51,690
it's just like, oh, you can understand
if you're in that situation.

561
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:55,300
Is that one of the reasons
why so many cops shoot people?

562
00:31:55,301 --> 00:32:00,301
It's like the idea of the rush of being
in a gun fight of the rush of finding

563
00:32:00,581 --> 00:32:04,510
someone who deserves to get shot.
You know it's like when you're hunting,

564
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:05,523
all right,
you're,

565
00:32:05,670 --> 00:32:09,340
you know you see animals that you're
not supposed to shoot but I swear to God

566
00:32:09,341 --> 00:32:11,710
there's a party.
Fucking Brandon wants to shoot a squirrel.

567
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:13,900
It was like a 300 win mag.

568
00:32:13,930 --> 00:32:18,670
You don't do it but there's a part of
your brain you like, you have a rifle.

569
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:21,430
He looked into the crosshairs squirl
doesn't even know you're there.

570
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:22,570
You don't do it.

571
00:32:22,571 --> 00:32:25,780
But there's a part of you that wants to
and I'm like why does that even exist?

572
00:32:25,781 --> 00:32:27,640
Because people like hitting targets.

573
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:31,390
The same reason why you like going to
the range and shooting at those steel

574
00:32:31,391 --> 00:32:33,070
targets.
Like why do you like,

575
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:35,650
because people like hitting things
with guns cause you have a gun.

576
00:32:35,770 --> 00:32:40,130
Like you said when you have a hammer
everything looks like a nail and when you

577
00:32:40,131 --> 00:32:45,131
were in your cop car and someone takes
off whether or not it makes sense to

578
00:32:45,441 --> 00:32:50,390
chase him, it must feel like the right
thing to do. Right? Like your instinct,

579
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:52,040
I'm going to go with you on the car chase.

580
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:56,600
I'm not going to go with you
on the shooting for like was I

581
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:02,540
looking for the target? Yeah, I was,
you know, if I had a guy with a knife,

582
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:05,240
I was sitting there, I was telling
him, put it down, put it down,

583
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:08,300
but in my head I'm of fuck, don't put
it down. You want them to come out,

584
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:10,940
shoot him fucking cop. I'm
going out there. You know?

585
00:33:10,941 --> 00:33:15,930
It's like this is what you do, but,
but you had a line for I, yeah,

586
00:33:15,931 --> 00:33:17,630
and I go to across it.
I certainly was going across,

587
00:33:17,631 --> 00:33:20,570
I was ready to shoot if I had to,
but I was never going to cross that line.

588
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:24,250
You kind of wanted to shoot.
Sure. Wow. I killed it.

589
00:33:24,550 --> 00:33:28,250
I come from the Marine Corps. I was in
fast team. Right. This is what I did.

590
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:33,020
I was trained from 17 I went to marine
court 17 I was handed a rifle in bootcamp

591
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:38,060
and I went into special ops and I was
trained day in and day out to kill.

592
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:40,280
That's,
that's the honest truth.

593
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:43,570
And then I have to transition
into bringing those skills,

594
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:48,290
that skill set into a police department
where luckily I was able to separate

595
00:33:48,291 --> 00:33:49,730
myself and it wasn't an issue for me,

596
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:51,710
but I don't think that's where
the shooting has come from.

597
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:54,500
I'm pretty convinced that your
military members actually won't shoot.

598
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:57,290
I'm convinced that the
shooting come from fear.

599
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,640
Uh,
that makes a lot of sense.

600
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:03,240
So the military members
have more discipline,

601
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:08,270
they've been through real war and they
understand shooting and death better.

602
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:11,220
Yeah. I think you just understand
the rules of engagement better.

603
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:15,570
Whereas the people that come
from civilian life, and you know,

604
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:20,700
there's a fucking video of this guy who's
this big fat slob who's a cop and a,

605
00:34:20,701 --> 00:34:24,810
he's trying to get ahold of this guy
and the guy winds up beating his ass and

606
00:34:24,811 --> 00:34:26,880
there's like this chaos
thing running around.

607
00:34:26,881 --> 00:34:29,160
But I'm looking at that guy and I'm like,
this guy does not,

608
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:32,640
there's no way this guy should be
a fucking law enforcement officer.

609
00:34:32,641 --> 00:34:35,160
He's just way to add a shape.

610
00:34:35,161 --> 00:34:38,550
He's just way too
undisciplined. You know, his,

611
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:41,490
his body is just not
serving him correctly.

612
00:34:41,491 --> 00:34:46,491
And he's involved in physical altercations
with criminals and to be a person

613
00:34:47,910 --> 00:34:52,910
that is in day to day contact with people
that may or may not want to kill you,

614
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:54,511
you're like,

615
00:34:54,511 --> 00:34:56,880
you have to have a certain amount of
awareness and you have to have a certain

616
00:34:56,881 --> 00:34:58,050
amount of physical ability.

617
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,010
Yeah.
And you have to trust those abilities.

618
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:02,710
You have to realize that you're going
to be able to handle that situation.

619
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:07,330
I think it's easier in a city then it
would be for Pennsylvania state trooper or

620
00:35:07,331 --> 00:35:09,160
something like, I don't know
what I would do in thirst shoes.

621
00:35:09,161 --> 00:35:11,980
And they're stuck out in the middle
of nowhere by themselves in a city,

622
00:35:11,981 --> 00:35:14,080
all you gotta do is hold on for 30
seconds, you're going to get help.

623
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:18,220
But how they do it in those environments,
baffling to me,

624
00:35:18,221 --> 00:35:22,510
but they don't get into a lot of shootings
as much as urban environments because

625
00:35:22,511 --> 00:35:27,100
I think it's that fear. But I think
as a nation we fear the black man.

626
00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:30,520
He's the demon. So you saw that and
Mike Brown, when that cop says, oh,

627
00:35:30,521 --> 00:35:33,400
he had a demons look in his eye
and the team is looking at it. I,

628
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:36,970
what are you talking about? Do you ever
see anybody say that Dylan roof? Oh,

629
00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:40,080
he looked like he had a demon. Look in
his eye. They don't say that. They say,

630
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:42,730
oh this troubled youth, but
the black guys, the demon.

631
00:35:42,731 --> 00:35:45,930
So we have that in our society
that that's the criminal.

632
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:48,900
So that's who we're looking at
and that's who we're fearing.

633
00:35:48,901 --> 00:35:51,710
We're fearing the black men raping.
Our daughters were fearing that,

634
00:35:51,711 --> 00:35:54,060
that whether we want to face it or not,
as a nation,

635
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:55,800
it's real and we have to face it.

636
00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:58,920
If we want to learn how to police
properly and we actually want to get our

637
00:35:58,921 --> 00:36:01,620
nation back to where it is and we
stopped and we tear down these borders,

638
00:36:01,621 --> 00:36:05,050
these things that we do, these social
constructs, your flags, you're your,

639
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:08,850
whether we have a line now in Mexico so
that they can't come over here and we

640
00:36:08,851 --> 00:36:11,940
don't help them. And, and we have
our states and we do all this other.

641
00:36:11,941 --> 00:36:15,000
All so much dumb shit that we just
make up the separate ourselves,

642
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:18,360
but there's no difference. He's, he's
got more Melatonin than I do. Wonderful.

643
00:36:18,361 --> 00:36:21,330
Whatever. They're just human
beings. We're all the same.

644
00:36:21,331 --> 00:36:25,160
We know that scientifically. We know
this. I agree with you on that. But there,

645
00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:27,860
the guy that shot the people in Colorado,

646
00:36:27,861 --> 00:36:32,000
that was one of the first things I said,
does it, is he looked possessed. The, the,

647
00:36:32,001 --> 00:36:33,050
his eyes were,
I mean,

648
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:36,410
I absolutely agree with you that
there is institutionalized racism.

649
00:36:36,411 --> 00:36:37,250
Absolutely agree with you.

650
00:36:37,251 --> 00:36:41,150
But I think anytime someone becomes
a school shooter or, I mean they,

651
00:36:41,210 --> 00:36:44,030
they treat that person like there
are some psychopathic maniac.

652
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:45,250
Yeah,
I can see that.

653
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:49,510
Did you get into altercations
where you had to shoot people?

654
00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:53,170
I could have pulled the
trigger justifiably, quite a
few times, but he never did.

655
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:57,310
No, no. 11 years in Baltimore in the city.

656
00:36:57,610 --> 00:37:00,640
And he didn't have to shoot anybody.
No, no, no. I can't. I mean,

657
00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:04,450
I know of two that were pretty happy.

658
00:37:04,451 --> 00:37:07,600
I'm pretty close to me and that were
completely, completely clean shootings.

659
00:37:07,601 --> 00:37:10,390
And again, it was an, it was an experiene.
Maybe I'm being biased. I don't know, but,

660
00:37:10,830 --> 00:37:13,440
well, it makes sense to me. I don't
think you're being biased at all.

661
00:37:13,441 --> 00:37:18,150
I would want someone who, first of
all, it's a logical progression.

662
00:37:18,151 --> 00:37:20,820
If someone is looking for a good job
and they get out of the military,

663
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:22,230
it's a logical progression.

664
00:37:22,231 --> 00:37:25,590
I would trust military members more than
I would trust the civilian has never

665
00:37:25,591 --> 00:37:30,210
seen any, any real gunfire or
any, any real shit. You know,

666
00:37:30,211 --> 00:37:34,590
someone who has never experienced any
sort of altercation like that and all of a

667
00:37:34,591 --> 00:37:38,610
sudden being thrust into it, you just
got to hope they can keep it together.

668
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:41,880
I know some people can,
but a lot of people can't.

669
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:46,140
Someone who's been through the marine,
someone who's been through, you know,

670
00:37:46,141 --> 00:37:48,780
anything, a navy seal, someone
who's been through war,

671
00:37:48,930 --> 00:37:53,370
that person in my eyes is a much more
qualified candidate than the average

672
00:37:53,371 --> 00:37:55,110
person.
It makes sense.

673
00:37:55,111 --> 00:37:58,710
So when you're talking to me and you're
saying that you had a certain amount of

674
00:37:58,711 --> 00:38:00,540
discipline and you had a sir,

675
00:38:00,930 --> 00:38:04,870
but you're also being very honest
about you wanted them to come at you,

676
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:07,230
which I think is a natural human instinct.

677
00:38:07,231 --> 00:38:09,570
I think it's very important that
you're talking like this. I really do.

678
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:10,920
Cause I think,
um,

679
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:13,530
there's a lot of people that would
shy away from talking like that,

680
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:17,400
especially someone who's still out of
a career in law enforcement. You know,

681
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:22,000
I think my, my hopes for resuming a career
in the US first, we are probably over.

682
00:38:22,090 --> 00:38:23,350
Yeah.
And less

683
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:28,010
when it comes along and listens to this
with an open mind and realize is know

684
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,590
this fucking guy is exactly what we need.

685
00:38:30,591 --> 00:38:32,480
And I think that is exactly what we need.

686
00:38:32,481 --> 00:38:36,100
We need people like you and we
need people like you, other people

687
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:39,760
are going to listen to and say, well,
here's a guy who was on our side.

688
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:41,560
Here's a guy who's not a racist.

689
00:38:41,561 --> 00:38:44,500
Here's a guy who's not just looking
to shoot people and lock people up.

690
00:38:44,501 --> 00:38:49,501
Here's a guy who really came into this
job wanting to help and experienced a

691
00:38:50,291 --> 00:38:54,420
bunch of fucking chaos. It's chaos.
There's no other better word for it. It's,

692
00:38:54,421 --> 00:38:57,760
it's the biggest shit show you'll see is
going to an urban environment and being

693
00:38:57,761 --> 00:39:00,760
thrust in that because you were,
it's not just, that's just saying,

694
00:39:00,761 --> 00:39:03,190
it's not just a street.
It's internal as well.

695
00:39:03,191 --> 00:39:08,191
The whole thing is a big cluster fuck of
mismanagement and no one's caring about

696
00:39:08,321 --> 00:39:11,770
what we actually need to do.
We need to end the damn drug war.

697
00:39:11,830 --> 00:39:13,840
This is ridiculous that we're doing this.

698
00:39:13,870 --> 00:39:18,100
So that's most of what you're
arresting people for. Oh Gosh, I don't,

699
00:39:18,610 --> 00:39:23,380
was it all of it?
90 90% Jesus fucking Christ.

700
00:39:23,381 --> 00:39:27,400
How crazy is that? How crazy is
that? 90% that's all that matters.

701
00:39:27,401 --> 00:39:29,980
There is guns and drugs, guns
and drugs, guns and drugs,

702
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:32,200
guns and drugs and guns
probably are there.

703
00:39:32,201 --> 00:39:35,390
So they could sell drugs and
defend themselves. Defend
themselves, right? Yeah.

704
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:39,250
Fucking hey man. What a
crazy, crazy situation.

705
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:45,150
Just a bizarre police state set up
by the fact that drugs are illegal,

706
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:52,780
man. It does. I mean it
invades the entire thing.

707
00:39:52,781 --> 00:39:57,030
So when we saw what happened with alcohol,
right?

708
00:39:57,100 --> 00:40:01,120
So gangs takeover and you have violence.

709
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:03,730
Do you want to lower the violence?
Isn't that the mission of the police?

710
00:40:03,731 --> 00:40:07,030
Do you want to lower the violence than
every single chief out there needs to be

711
00:40:07,031 --> 00:40:09,130
saying, hey, we need to end
this drug war. Stop it. Yeah.

712
00:40:09,131 --> 00:40:11,320
How many cops are saying
that we need to stop bars?

713
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:14,770
How about none there a single bar?
You know?

714
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:16,170
And that's what causes all the fighting.

715
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:18,160
We all know that if they were
all sitting around smoking,

716
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:19,510
they've nothing would have happened.

717
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:23,850
But also I support their right to get
fucked up if they want. You know, I'm,

718
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:28,540
I've been drunk a lot and I've
never heard anybody. Never,

719
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:33,400
never did anything fucked up. Never cause
any crimes. Never heard anybody. Never.

720
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:37,120
You know,
I just don't think that human,

721
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:39,400
I think human beings should be able
to do whatever the fuck they want.

722
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:43,980
I think when you,
when you violate somehow or another,

723
00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:46,810
you violate either other people's
rights or other people's safety or other

724
00:40:46,811 --> 00:40:48,670
people's health and welfare,

725
00:40:48,671 --> 00:40:53,020
then it becomes a real issue and you
should be prosecuted based on whatever

726
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,120
transgressions you've committed.
Right.

727
00:40:55,121 --> 00:40:59,440
So don't you agree then that the drug war
distracts you from actually being 100%

728
00:40:59,441 --> 00:41:01,690
real police?
100% totally turned you away from it.

729
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:06,400
What kind of relationship did you have
with the people in Baltimore that you

730
00:41:06,401 --> 00:41:09,760
would, your area, did
you develop friendships?

731
00:41:09,761 --> 00:41:12,520
Did you develop any sort of
connection with those folks? None.

732
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:17,470
I was an occupying force. I handled my
stuff and I went out because so so to,

733
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:20,710
to know you. If you were
in my neighborhood, I would
have to stop and talk to you.

734
00:41:20,790 --> 00:41:24,610
I mean, I'd have to spend time with you.
I may even have to talk to your kids.

735
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:27,100
We could shoot the shit on the
corner or something like that.

736
00:41:27,101 --> 00:41:28,750
But the whole time I'm doing that,

737
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:34,040
the the departments are going to actually
be criticizing me and I'm not doing my

738
00:41:34,161 --> 00:41:38,900
job. Because you're not writing tickets,
not pulling people over. You're not,

739
00:41:38,901 --> 00:41:42,320
you don't, you're not meeting your
quotas. I'm not getting my stats.

740
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:46,280
I'm not making the arrest
that I need to make. So I was,

741
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:50,210
I came out of the academy and went and
walked foot where Freddie gray is and the

742
00:41:50,211 --> 00:41:55,040
Gilmore homes. So that was my first
foray. So I got solidified into this,

743
00:41:55,041 --> 00:41:58,070
US versus them. You threw me right into
the biggest war zone. We have foot,

744
00:41:58,100 --> 00:42:01,400
one foot. How many who,
who were you with another?

745
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:03,680
Another trainee that had no idea
what the hell he was doing. Either.

746
00:42:03,690 --> 00:42:06,820
You didn't want to team up with two
others. So you're playing cops, right?

747
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:10,550
Totally playing. Wow. And we
were doing all drug arrests.

748
00:42:11,090 --> 00:42:15,950
So we would go up and we would like go
and covert and into the projects because

749
00:42:15,951 --> 00:42:17,300
the projects had heat
and it was wintertime.

750
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:20,540
So you could like break into one of the
doors and it had heat in it and then you

751
00:42:20,541 --> 00:42:25,310
could watch what happened in the court
yard and people would sell and we would

752
00:42:25,311 --> 00:42:28,820
have one of us would run down
out of the room, circle around.

753
00:42:28,970 --> 00:42:32,930
So you would go and break into a room
because it had heat in it. Right?

754
00:42:32,931 --> 00:42:37,280
Because their projects there, they, the
heat stays on. So it'd be an empty vacant,

755
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:39,920
a vacant apartment, right? Yeah.

756
00:42:39,921 --> 00:42:42,590
And the heat would be all on
pick the lock or just kicking it.

757
00:42:42,650 --> 00:42:45,050
You can't always find a way and
just pick a lock. You get a key.

758
00:42:45,051 --> 00:42:47,840
There was always a way and
someone, someone else usually
already did it for you.

759
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:48,650
Right.

760
00:42:48,650 --> 00:42:52,250
And we would watch them and like my first
arrests went down there and grab them.

761
00:42:52,251 --> 00:42:53,680
And the first thing you
said was, uh, you know,

762
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:57,520
these aren't my pants because he
knew he had the drugs in them.

763
00:42:59,490 --> 00:43:03,320
Pants. That's the first guy
you arrested. That's hilarious.

764
00:43:03,321 --> 00:43:05,650
Boy Did you know you were
in for a fucking world of

765
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:10,970
what a great way to start off a career.
That's like the perfect way.

766
00:43:11,110 --> 00:43:13,040
The first guy you arrest has,
these are not,

767
00:43:13,041 --> 00:43:14,540
what is my first thing you I grab his arm.

768
00:43:16,430 --> 00:43:20,720
So I go there and I go to the southern,
which is a area where it's, um,

769
00:43:21,470 --> 00:43:22,760
you would be fascinated there.

770
00:43:22,970 --> 00:43:25,400
I'm just going to be bluntly honest cause
that's the whole point of this is you

771
00:43:25,401 --> 00:43:29,150
have a black ghetto,
you have white trash for the most part,

772
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:33,200
and then you have this cluster next
to it. A really good people, uh,

773
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:34,880
doctors,
lawyers,

774
00:43:34,881 --> 00:43:38,930
just regular people that in that area
that are nice and they mingled together

775
00:43:39,110 --> 00:43:40,250
and it's chaos.

776
00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:45,910
So I go from that in chaos because college
kids that are going to university of

777
00:43:46,611 --> 00:43:49,430
Maryland think that they can just
walk down the street and to the bad

778
00:43:49,431 --> 00:43:50,780
neighborhood and everything will be fine.

779
00:43:50,781 --> 00:43:53,000
They think they could drink and walk
down the street and nothing's going to

780
00:43:53,001 --> 00:43:57,350
happen to them. Uh, the, the, what does
happen? They're going to get robbed.

781
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:01,490
They know it. We know. They didn't
know we knew it and he's like, Hey,

782
00:44:01,491 --> 00:44:05,480
what are you doing? Don't do that. Uh,
the, the, the whites and the neighborhood,

783
00:44:05,481 --> 00:44:09,380
you would have a really hard time
figuring out your reports because you were

784
00:44:09,381 --> 00:44:12,980
supposed to put in like who the person's
relationship was and you're like, wait,

785
00:44:13,510 --> 00:44:17,360
is it your cousin? Is that wait, you,
so he's your cousin and your uncle.

786
00:44:17,361 --> 00:44:21,590
This isn't making sense. So what
block do I put? The guy that did it?

787
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:26,180
Was he your cousin or no, he
was your uncle. It's like, nope.

788
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:31,320
And everything was all together.
So like there's so much inbreeding really.

789
00:44:31,321 --> 00:44:34,680
You actually, you would
have these crazy things, uh,

790
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:40,100
that you would have Hispanics that came
in and were trying to come up themselves

791
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:42,510
and it was all just go together.
It's chaos.

792
00:44:42,511 --> 00:44:47,511
You can go there right now and it's just
a crazy societal test bed of everybody

793
00:44:47,641 --> 00:44:49,770
coming together from these
entirely different backgrounds.

794
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:54,080
And there's real inbreeding.
Yeah. It's like super common.
Everybody knows it. Yeah.

795
00:44:54,220 --> 00:44:57,180
Really?
What the fuck.

796
00:44:57,300 --> 00:45:01,790
So I go from there and I go
to inbreeding is like you've,

797
00:45:01,791 --> 00:45:05,210
we'd run into that every day.
Not every day. Once a week. Yeah.

798
00:45:05,230 --> 00:45:08,100
Maybe if you're working there.
Hey Man.

799
00:45:08,790 --> 00:45:11,010
So I go from there and I go
to the northern district,

800
00:45:11,011 --> 00:45:13,470
which is this area
called Mount Washington.

801
00:45:13,890 --> 00:45:18,300
Mount Washington is a
upperclass 80% to 90% white.

802
00:45:19,070 --> 00:45:22,930
Uh, you have judges that lived
there, you have nice houses, 400,

803
00:45:22,950 --> 00:45:27,660
$500,000 houses. And now I'm in
this environment and it's like,

804
00:45:27,661 --> 00:45:30,570
Holy Shit, where am I?
Yeah, I'm in white land now.

805
00:45:30,571 --> 00:45:34,200
I have this road that's
called cost country boulevard
and it has extreme next to

806
00:45:34,201 --> 00:45:35,880
it.
What the hell am I doing here?

807
00:45:36,450 --> 00:45:40,560
So I'm expected to get the same amount
of arrest and I'm Spec to write, take it.

808
00:45:40,561 --> 00:45:44,510
So I have bosses that are telling me like,
you're not doing anything like, well,

809
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:47,430
what am I supposed to do? I'm like,
in a good neighborhood, what do I do?

810
00:45:47,970 --> 00:45:50,100
So I would leave my area,

811
00:45:50,370 --> 00:45:55,370
go to the black neighborhoods and make
drug arrests so that I could appease my

812
00:45:55,621 --> 00:46:00,390
bosses with my arrest numbers. So you're
continuing that cycle. Once again,

813
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:05,840
I'm leaving that area to go poach and
specifically continue that cycle and I'm

814
00:46:06,931 --> 00:46:09,000
doing it because that's what
I'm supposed to be doing.

815
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:14,610
So if you were in a place that had
no crime, you would get in trouble.

816
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:15,600
Yeah.
Yeah.

817
00:46:15,601 --> 00:46:20,560
I had my one sergeant had to defend me
constantly because I went to a post in

818
00:46:20,580 --> 00:46:23,010
that same district where I started
bringing the crime numbers down,

819
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:25,040
but I didn't have the arrests and he's,

820
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:27,480
he had to defend me to his
bosses saying like, look,

821
00:46:27,481 --> 00:46:32,220
he hasn't had a part one a
serious crime it in a long time.

822
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:33,900
That's like that's his job.

823
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:36,700
And I was getting criticized the whole
time cause I didn't have as many rounds.

824
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:39,060
That's like the ultimate goal,
right, is to have no crime.

825
00:46:39,061 --> 00:46:41,310
Shouldn't that be the metric that
should be, it's not a metric,

826
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:45,780
but if we all had no crime, like I,
I've also, I've often proposed this,

827
00:46:45,781 --> 00:46:49,740
like if we had a moratorium on crime, if
the whole country got together and said,

828
00:46:49,741 --> 00:46:54,570
all right, no one for the next month,
we can go 30 days without speeding.

829
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:57,330
30 days without illegal turns.

830
00:46:57,331 --> 00:47:01,530
30 days without any violent crime,
30 days without any theft.

831
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:05,070
What would happen?
We'd probably make some up,

832
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:08,980
but make up some crops just
to arrest black people.

833
00:47:09,190 --> 00:47:13,230
That's what reality is.
But that's what we should be.

834
00:47:13,231 --> 00:47:18,231
So like my liberal idea of policing
would be to empower that officer.

835
00:47:18,661 --> 00:47:21,630
That's one of the street.
So even if there wasn't crime,

836
00:47:21,930 --> 00:47:25,770
than what he would really be doing is
making sure that the alley was cleaned up,

837
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:27,810
solving problems that
are in the neighborhood.

838
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:30,040
So whatever the problem could possibly

839
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:30,461
be,
you know,

840
00:47:30,461 --> 00:47:33,220
there's this guy that constantly parts
on this corner and the street sweeper

841
00:47:33,221 --> 00:47:37,040
can't get it. We'll fix all
those problems. So even if
you don't have crime, the,

842
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:41,920
the peace officer, the protector should
still have plenty of things to do.

843
00:47:42,610 --> 00:47:47,170
So it shouldn't be just crime.
Crime should be an element
of, of what police did.

844
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:51,040
Did you have to pull over people and
write tickets for speeding and shit like

845
00:47:51,041 --> 00:47:53,980
that? Or Walmart doesn't care
about that. They don't care. No.

846
00:47:54,010 --> 00:47:57,220
You can just drive crazy pretty
much. Really? Yeah. There's,

847
00:47:57,310 --> 00:48:01,260
there's no traffic cops or anything
like that in the city. What? Um, yeah,

848
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:05,590
it's just doesn't work that way. Um,
what, yeah, there's no traffic cops.

849
00:48:05,630 --> 00:48:07,240
I mean maybe a district here,

850
00:48:07,241 --> 00:48:10,000
there might have one guy that
kind of primarily does traffic,

851
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:13,630
but it's just patrol officers
are expected to handle traffic.

852
00:48:14,050 --> 00:48:18,880
And again, remember I'm not being
judged on that, so why would I care?

853
00:48:19,110 --> 00:48:20,230
Right.
So my car is not,

854
00:48:20,231 --> 00:48:23,530
the only reason I do a car stop is to
get guns or drugs or maybe a warrant.

855
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:25,180
Like so.

856
00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:29,020
So if I turn a plate right and the guy
has a warrant driver has a warrant,

857
00:48:29,290 --> 00:48:31,630
then yeah, I'm going to do that. So
I'm not going to do it unless it's,

858
00:48:32,140 --> 00:48:33,640
I haven't a possibility of an arrest.

859
00:48:33,641 --> 00:48:35,800
I'm not going to sit there
and write bullcrap tickets.

860
00:48:36,460 --> 00:48:40,270
Did you arrest the same guys more than
once? Yeah. Yeah, plenty of times.

861
00:48:40,271 --> 00:48:42,760
Especially when I was doing narcotics.
So after I went from the northern,

862
00:48:42,761 --> 00:48:46,240
I went to a unit called the
violent crime impact division,

863
00:48:46,270 --> 00:48:47,470
and it was like plain clothes.

864
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:51,080
Got To have the tats out and be all tough
and run around like you are, you are,

865
00:48:51,110 --> 00:48:52,930
you know,
they called knockers in the city.

866
00:48:53,740 --> 00:48:57,460
And so from there you're dealing with
the shame street level dealers all the

867
00:48:57,461 --> 00:49:01,790
time. And uh, uh, one of those
kids actually really struck me. Um,

868
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:02,673
maybe,

869
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:07,420
so a great irony that I had in doing
drug work is usually drug works makes you

870
00:49:07,450 --> 00:49:09,730
sent you to the deeper into it.

871
00:49:10,060 --> 00:49:15,060
And it actually pulled me out because I
would interview these guys in the little

872
00:49:15,581 --> 00:49:16,750
rooms.
And this one guy,

873
00:49:16,751 --> 00:49:20,450
Daniel Taylor is the one I'm specifically
remembering and he was just a,

874
00:49:20,451 --> 00:49:24,340
a marijuana dealer and he had a kid
and he was struggling to have this kid.

875
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:26,050
He was young,
he was trying to help,

876
00:49:26,051 --> 00:49:27,820
but he had gotten a locked
up a lot when he was younger.

877
00:49:27,821 --> 00:49:31,330
So he was selling weed just
like buy diapers for his kid.

878
00:49:31,331 --> 00:49:35,020
And he would tell me his stories and we'd
be there and he'd be crying and it was

879
00:49:35,021 --> 00:49:38,950
just like, fuck, there's no difference
between this kid and me. There's nothing.

880
00:49:38,980 --> 00:49:42,460
The only difference between this kid and
me is that when I had a dime bag in my

881
00:49:42,461 --> 00:49:46,540
pocket, there wasn't a fucking chance in
hell. Someone was going to look but him,

882
00:49:46,630 --> 00:49:50,680
he was going to get caught eventually
and it sent him into that spiral.

883
00:49:50,830 --> 00:49:54,010
And this could have been a good kid and
I wouldn't be surprised if he was still

884
00:49:54,011 --> 00:49:56,890
in jail now and there was just
nothing wrong with him. We,

885
00:49:57,190 --> 00:50:02,190
our whole system created a criminal
out of a decent kid and it was,

886
00:50:03,251 --> 00:50:04,640
it was shocking to me.
Like I,

887
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:09,490
I like I knew I was following the
rules and so I had to arrest him.

888
00:50:09,491 --> 00:50:12,220
I had to finish this up because it was
doing what I'm supposed to be doing,

889
00:50:12,370 --> 00:50:16,990
but it was kind of heartbreaking and start
to see that these people, they didn't,

890
00:50:17,140 --> 00:50:18,850
they weren't different than us.

891
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:21,970
They just had a different environment
than us and we should be changing that

892
00:50:21,971 --> 00:50:24,990
environment, not changing
them. So you felt this was,

893
00:50:24,991 --> 00:50:27,710
so let me back up a bit.

894
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:31,970
This going into this district
and this new position,

895
00:50:32,180 --> 00:50:34,970
why were you allowed to wear regular
clothes and what was the idea you're

896
00:50:34,971 --> 00:50:36,650
supposed to blend in?
So the idea,

897
00:50:37,030 --> 00:50:39,820
so you're supposed to have an advantage
to sneak up and all that. Then I also,

898
00:50:39,830 --> 00:50:42,650
I haven't taught a quick funny story
about that, but you're a white guy.

899
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:47,390
This is really good. Sorry. I appreciate
it. Okay, so I that's always the struggle,

900
00:50:47,780 --> 00:50:52,640
right? So the tattoos, blackface,
no, no. Stop it. So why is that bad?

901
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:57,080
I don't understand it. I really don't.
Go ahead and set the tats were out.

902
00:50:57,530 --> 00:51:00,830
I had a red Mazda six with tinted windows,

903
00:51:01,070 --> 00:51:04,850
Virginia tags cut off.
Sleeves was rolling down.

904
00:51:04,851 --> 00:51:08,300
Thinking I was blending is Zit.
I look like I'm some buying.

905
00:51:08,301 --> 00:51:11,960
This is going to be anything you consider
maybe like carving a lightening bolt

906
00:51:11,961 --> 00:51:15,080
and your hair. She could
have done something crazy
just to look a little more.

907
00:51:15,081 --> 00:51:18,410
It's kind of guy was out there
by like your trans racial perhaps

908
00:51:20,090 --> 00:51:24,560
not opening that kid. They're there or
any open, you don't even have to dig in.

909
00:51:25,230 --> 00:51:27,320
It's overflowing.
I don't have an opinion.

910
00:51:27,321 --> 00:51:30,760
I'm so happy that girl's
alive and so happy.

911
00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:35,690
Just debate is on and it gives you fodder.
Well, yes, I'm a fan of human folly.

912
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:40,700
So, so you're rolling around like a
white guy sticking out like a sore thumb

913
00:51:40,850 --> 00:51:45,620
thinking I wasn't and it turned the corner
and literally I was like a four year

914
00:51:45,621 --> 00:51:48,950
old boy. He's like, Yo dad
have knockers right there.

915
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:51,430
It just as good as I get.

916
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:55,820
This is all I have and I still could
blend it. So what was the point there?

917
00:51:56,750 --> 00:52:01,610
So they knew that there was a position
that cops get into where they,

918
00:52:01,770 --> 00:52:05,090
they're allowed to dress like normal
people called knockers in Baltimore.

919
00:52:05,660 --> 00:52:09,240
And you called knockers by the police
department as well or just find out by the

920
00:52:09,260 --> 00:52:13,430
civilians. Civilians. And why do
you think you're called knockers?

921
00:52:13,700 --> 00:52:17,740
Obvious answer. Why knock heads. It's
what you do. Oh, I see. On the street,

922
00:52:17,750 --> 00:52:19,940
you're the force.
You're the enforcement team.

923
00:52:19,941 --> 00:52:21,860
So that's actually what it was
caused by enforcement team.

924
00:52:21,870 --> 00:52:24,290
We went out there and stamp down the drug.

925
00:52:24,350 --> 00:52:28,820
Is there pressure to be
intimidating to like to you must,

926
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:32,660
yes. You must be intimidating.
I wouldn't survive so,

927
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:37,680
so you can look at me and you can think
of me being in the wire and Jamie would

928
00:52:38,001 --> 00:52:41,600
I have survived? If I was
not intimidating. No, no.

929
00:52:41,601 --> 00:52:44,370
I wouldn't have survived and
still watch the wire. Goddammit.

930
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:47,720
So like a technique is actually
to find one of the biggest,

931
00:52:47,721 --> 00:52:52,130
baddest dudes in your area and
kick his ass punk him. Yeah.

932
00:52:52,130 --> 00:52:55,560
You have to use weapons or would
it? How you doing? No, no, no.

933
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:57,170
You're going to arrest him for something.

934
00:52:57,380 --> 00:53:01,670
You're going to be a little rough with
him. You're going to do something to, uh,

935
00:53:01,850 --> 00:53:05,070
cause he's the, he's the king
dog in that neighborhood. Right.

936
00:53:05,110 --> 00:53:08,300
So you have to a certain the Alpha role.
If you don't do that,

937
00:53:08,301 --> 00:53:11,240
you're gonna get run over. A lot of cops
don't do it. But if you don't do that,

938
00:53:11,241 --> 00:53:13,160
you are not going to survive
in a drug unit for sure.

939
00:53:13,660 --> 00:53:17,060
You're going to get trampled. Why do
you, why do you survive if you do do it?

940
00:53:17,061 --> 00:53:20,360
I would think you're making an enemy.
Yeah. It's a battle. It's a war.

941
00:53:20,390 --> 00:53:23,420
It's what it is. It's a drug war.
Don't be fooled. That's what it is.

942
00:53:23,421 --> 00:53:26,880
That's what we've created.
It's so it's US versus them.

943
00:53:26,910 --> 00:53:30,750
And if I'm going to be ahead, I have
to be the Alpha Dog. Right. You know,

944
00:53:30,751 --> 00:53:32,520
I've never obviously never been a cop,

945
00:53:32,521 --> 00:53:35,760
but I worked as a security guard
for a while at this concert place.

946
00:53:35,761 --> 00:53:39,720
And one of the things that I've recognized
really early on was that there was a

947
00:53:39,750 --> 00:53:44,430
US versus them mentality just from fucking
security guards at a concert place.

948
00:53:44,970 --> 00:53:49,970
And I would imagine the US versus them
between cops and the people on the street

949
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:54,450
gets pretty fucking intense,
pretty big division.

950
00:53:55,110 --> 00:53:58,860
And that is how you can have a black
officer who's participating in a racist

951
00:53:58,861 --> 00:54:00,870
organization just like anybody else did.

952
00:54:00,871 --> 00:54:05,820
You have a lot of black officers in
Baltimore is about, it's about even. Wow.

953
00:54:05,850 --> 00:54:07,890
So,
but there's no difference.

954
00:54:08,220 --> 00:54:10,680
Maybe even the black officers
a little bit more aggressive.

955
00:54:10,681 --> 00:54:13,830
I have a theory on that, but I, well
that was an ice tea thing. Ice Tea,

956
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:16,530
you said talk about
that. And I said, yeah,

957
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:21,600
I think that's what they've always felt
that there was black cops that made up

958
00:54:21,601 --> 00:54:24,090
for the fact that they were
black by being extra brutal.

959
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:27,060
And that's what they thought. I don't
actually think that that's why, uh,

960
00:54:27,090 --> 00:54:31,890
it's conjecture but my part, but I
think that's because they're actually,

961
00:54:32,310 --> 00:54:36,360
they feel embarrassed that those people,
they feel like,

962
00:54:36,490 --> 00:54:41,340
like the black criminals are making the
black race, the black community look bad.

963
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:43,440
So that kind of like extra angry.

964
00:54:43,470 --> 00:54:47,480
Whereas I'm not going to be angry
because I don't care. Oh, I see. Huh.

965
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,880
Maybe it could be a little bit
of both or either or. Certainly.

966
00:54:50,881 --> 00:54:55,650
So for different people. Wow. What the
fuck dude? What a crazy life you lived.

967
00:54:56,440 --> 00:55:00,000
Yeah, I didn't think of it. I looked at
the time. Right. But now being out of it,

968
00:55:00,030 --> 00:55:02,610
how long did it take before you
realize how fucking crazy it was?

969
00:55:02,910 --> 00:55:07,780
It started when I was in, but it started
with like talking to that kid that was,

970
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:11,760
and then I would also sit and covert
and watched. So you'll love this.

971
00:55:11,761 --> 00:55:12,594
And one time I was,

972
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:17,190
we were doing a long investigation and
I had this vacant building that I would

973
00:55:17,191 --> 00:55:17,920
hide in.

974
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:20,820
A homeless dude was there and a homeless
dude with like leave magazines for me.

975
00:55:20,821 --> 00:55:23,010
And then like I would come in during
the day and he would come in at night.

976
00:55:23,011 --> 00:55:24,960
It was the weirdest exchange.
We never crossed paths though.

977
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:28,790
You would leave magazines for yeah, yeah,
yeah. It's the worst cop monthly. No, no,

978
00:55:28,820 --> 00:55:29,501
no.
It was a cop.

979
00:55:29,501 --> 00:55:33,090
I think he legally playboy or he'd lean
times or something like that whenever he

980
00:55:33,091 --> 00:55:35,430
had. And he knew I was
there. I knew he was there,

981
00:55:35,431 --> 00:55:37,850
but we never actually crossed paths.
But they had a,

982
00:55:37,860 --> 00:55:41,320
so he left them for you though? Yeah,
man. We both knew we were there and uh,

983
00:55:41,670 --> 00:55:46,410
he had a, if there was a big, huge
picture of Jesus filling the window,

984
00:55:46,650 --> 00:55:49,560
and so I carved out Jesus's eyes
and I would stand behind him.

985
00:55:49,950 --> 00:55:54,950
And that's how I watched so
double meaning Jesus Christ.

986
00:55:55,950 --> 00:55:58,350
So I was actually standing
[inaudible] watch it,

987
00:55:58,830 --> 00:56:00,630
all the drug dealers on the investigation.

988
00:56:01,110 --> 00:56:04,500
But while I would watch all
these investigations like that,

989
00:56:04,740 --> 00:56:08,820
you would see everything for what it
was and not for your perceptions because

990
00:56:08,821 --> 00:56:12,900
you were there for so long.
So I would see the dealer sitting there,

991
00:56:13,020 --> 00:56:15,510
but then I would see him
take care of his kid.

992
00:56:15,511 --> 00:56:17,190
I would see him sit down and make food.

993
00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:20,490
I would hear the other people in the
neighborhood talking about their lives and

994
00:56:20,491 --> 00:56:23,290
hearing the smells of the hearing,
the sound, smelling the smells,

995
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:27,550
and realizing that this just wasn't a war.

996
00:56:27,580 --> 00:56:30,280
This is ridiculous that we were
doing this. This was not the enemy.

997
00:56:30,370 --> 00:56:33,850
This was a socioeconomic problem that
we had to deal with, but this isn't,

998
00:56:34,060 --> 00:56:37,030
this isn't the enemy. We are not
at war. That's just preposterous.

999
00:56:37,210 --> 00:56:41,320
So by being embedded in their community,

1000
00:56:41,860 --> 00:56:44,170
you recognize that we really are,

1001
00:56:44,210 --> 00:56:49,210
are you really were an occupying force
and just a a community that's trying to

1002
00:56:49,211 --> 00:56:51,550
get by and just a bunch of people
that are just like you or I,

1003
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:55,540
but there are circumstances were
unfortunate. They were born into this,

1004
00:56:56,140 --> 00:56:57,670
this situation where this,

1005
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:01,870
this cycle is perpetuated over and over
and over again and you've got a chance

1006
00:57:01,871 --> 00:57:03,760
to see it. All right,
let's not fool ourselves.

1007
00:57:03,790 --> 00:57:06,580
We want all won the lottery
here by being born in America.

1008
00:57:07,690 --> 00:57:09,670
We all won the lottery by being white.

1009
00:57:11,110 --> 00:57:13,220
So we have to recognize that angel

1010
00:57:16,290 --> 00:57:21,040
actually did go or if she's not, she's not
white. I checked in is plaque. I don't,

1011
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:24,580
I get, I don't have an opinion of that. I
don't, sure. Don't send me to everybody.

1012
00:57:25,570 --> 00:57:29,710
Everybody should. Orange is the new
black. Right. Right. She's orange.

1013
00:57:30,350 --> 00:57:35,350
Ever look at her skin. You're
wrong. I'm not wrong. Look,

1014
00:57:35,351 --> 00:57:39,610
she did some good work too. She's a good,
uh, she was running the NAACP very well.

1015
00:57:40,140 --> 00:57:41,500
She's a great job.
She was there though.

1016
00:57:41,830 --> 00:57:45,250
She's got some issues she likes
black dudes at, she wanted to fit in.

1017
00:57:45,251 --> 00:57:47,170
There's a little farther
than that. Oh, a little bit.

1018
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:51,910
Some people want to be checks. Some
people want to be black. Who gives a fuck?

1019
00:57:52,250 --> 00:57:55,280
Whether it be black. Sure.
She's helping. I got you.

1020
00:57:55,450 --> 00:57:57,910
A lot of people got mad at her
though. Yeah, I can imagine.

1021
00:57:57,970 --> 00:58:02,290
We're getting off track. It's all
right. Did other officers share your,

1022
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:06,020
your, uh, I want to say like, I don't,

1023
00:58:06,050 --> 00:58:07,630
I don't want to say humanization,

1024
00:58:07,660 --> 00:58:12,460
but do your recognition of the fact
that these folks are just like you,

1025
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:16,870
did other officers have that same feeling?
I think a lot of them do,

1026
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:21,110
but it wasn't discussed. No. I mean you
don't discuss it while you're in. Uh,

1027
00:58:21,130 --> 00:58:23,750
except for maybe a few people.
When I was a sergeant, I had a,

1028
00:58:23,930 --> 00:58:25,930
a pretty good sphere of influence,

1029
00:58:26,170 --> 00:58:30,280
so our squad was a little more talkative
about things like that and could be

1030
00:58:30,281 --> 00:58:32,680
open and discuss those kinds of things.
Uh,

1031
00:58:32,990 --> 00:58:35,500
I took an officer once and just put
it on plain clothes and kind of walked

1032
00:58:35,501 --> 00:58:38,470
around the district just not being cops.

1033
00:58:38,830 --> 00:58:42,070
And that shows you like how much different
the neighborhood is then what you

1034
00:58:42,071 --> 00:58:45,100
think because you go from nine one
one call to nine, one one call,

1035
00:58:45,101 --> 00:58:47,260
it's nine one one call seen
everybody at their worst.

1036
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:48,820
And when you're not seeing
them at their worst,

1037
00:58:48,850 --> 00:58:53,850
you're hunting for somebody that you can
possibly pretend that they're doing at

1038
00:58:53,921 --> 00:58:56,650
their worst, whether they have
drugs on them or or, or whatever.

1039
00:58:57,220 --> 00:59:00,190
But when you go through the city,

1040
00:59:00,550 --> 00:59:02,890
it's not at all what you think it is.

1041
00:59:02,890 --> 00:59:07,890
So even me looking like a prototypical
white kid looking to sell to buy drugs in

1042
00:59:08,020 --> 00:59:10,330
the, in the hood, when I
would go through the deal,

1043
00:59:10,331 --> 00:59:13,120
it's not like the dealers are pushers.
I mean, they would come up, Yo,

1044
00:59:13,121 --> 00:59:16,810
you want a party now and you keep on
moving. Sometimes they didn't trust me.

1045
00:59:16,811 --> 00:59:20,440
I was in too good a shape. They'd
be like, no. But they want like,

1046
00:59:20,441 --> 00:59:21,770
they were like pressuring you.

1047
00:59:21,830 --> 00:59:24,950
It's not like things were crayons and
neighborhood ladies were sweeping their

1048
00:59:24,951 --> 00:59:25,550
steps,

1049
00:59:25,550 --> 00:59:30,440
but the neighborhood changes when you
have that blue uniform in those lights and

1050
00:59:30,470 --> 00:59:32,810
your now the authority,

1051
00:59:32,870 --> 00:59:36,890
you kind of have to see the city for what
it's like when you're not there. Right.

1052
00:59:36,891 --> 00:59:41,540
So your point of view riding in a car,
it's like, yeah, there's a filter.

1053
00:59:41,610 --> 00:59:42,890
Super Myopic. Yeah. Yeah.

1054
00:59:42,891 --> 00:59:47,690
And you never really get a
chance to experience it like
a person who lives there.

1055
00:59:47,780 --> 00:59:49,760
I mean, even if you don't
really, if you don't live there,

1056
00:59:49,761 --> 00:59:53,690
but I mean just you get a better
view of it walking around and not,

1057
00:59:53,750 --> 00:59:56,370
not acting as a cop. Right. It's,

1058
00:59:56,720 --> 00:59:59,990
it seems common sense
that you would do that.

1059
01:00:00,020 --> 01:00:02,810
What would you think about cops being
forced to live in the places that they

1060
01:00:02,811 --> 01:00:06,320
have to patrol? I think as a trial,
that's a real tough situation.

1061
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:10,220
It was a real tough argument
and very nuanced. Um, I would,

1062
01:00:10,550 --> 01:00:14,180
there's no way I would live in Baltimore
city because I didn't make enough money

1063
01:00:14,270 --> 01:00:17,720
for my daughter to go to a private
school and I wasn't sending her to that

1064
01:00:17,721 --> 01:00:19,240
school to prison cycle.
Right.

1065
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:23,630
So I moved the PA where I could send her
to a good school and actually afford to

1066
01:00:23,810 --> 01:00:25,640
now sure if I made enough money.

1067
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:29,150
If you're going to pay an officer
$150,000 slash $60,000, yeah,

1068
01:00:29,151 --> 01:00:33,110
he can stay in the city. He or
she can st city, but just say Pa,

1069
01:00:33,111 --> 01:00:36,780
you lived in Pennsylvania, right? So how
far away was that from where you were at?

1070
01:00:36,781 --> 01:00:39,050
40 minutes.
So you would live in Pennsylvania,

1071
01:00:39,090 --> 01:00:42,890
send your kid to school there and
then drive to work. Right. Fuck man.

1072
01:00:43,340 --> 01:00:46,520
And that's common.
So a lot of police live in,

1073
01:00:47,140 --> 01:00:49,580
in the southern Pa area,
driving back and forth in Maryland.

1074
01:00:49,581 --> 01:00:52,880
A lot of workers period do that.
There's a lot of communities around La,

1075
01:00:52,881 --> 01:00:56,360
like Simi Valley is a
big one where there's big
communities, a police officer's.

1076
01:00:56,810 --> 01:00:58,640
Is that the same thing with their,

1077
01:00:58,641 --> 01:01:02,090
where they just sort of decide live
near each other, close together.

1078
01:01:02,150 --> 01:01:06,050
But you don't do it intentionally? It's,
no, it's economically driven. Oh, okay.

1079
01:01:06,140 --> 01:01:09,140
So it's economically driven.
Like you find a place that's affordable,

1080
01:01:09,350 --> 01:01:12,710
but you don't, you don't, you don't try
to move where the other cops live. No, no,

1081
01:01:12,711 --> 01:01:16,370
I wouldn't want to do that. And
we worked with them all day. Well,

1082
01:01:16,371 --> 01:01:18,090
I know my friends that are cops,

1083
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:21,350
they actually did it on purpose or some
that live in Santa Clarita or a little

1084
01:01:21,351 --> 01:01:25,490
deeper than they were pretty deep into
that then. Well, you know how it is.

1085
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:28,460
It becomes like a gang,
right, isn't it? It is.

1086
01:01:28,461 --> 01:01:31,260
We actually say in the city that there
is one gang and that's the blue gangs.

1087
01:01:31,261 --> 01:01:36,080
So like we don't let people,
so aggression is good in a certain extent.

1088
01:01:36,081 --> 01:01:40,520
We don't let a gang members
throw flags like so in my post,

1089
01:01:40,521 --> 01:01:43,010
if somebody had a red Bandana, blue
Bandana, it's taken out of their pocket.

1090
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:46,180
That shit was not going down. So you
arrested someone who wasn't wrestling?

1091
01:01:46,220 --> 01:01:48,040
I'm just pumpkin. Pumpkin. So,

1092
01:01:48,440 --> 01:01:51,980
so you're embarrassing me in front of
his friends who take his stuff and you

1093
01:01:51,981 --> 01:01:56,180
roll out. Did you ever
experience resistance? That's
sure they're going to resist.

1094
01:01:56,181 --> 01:01:58,100
If we're going to resist that
then it's going to go bad.

1095
01:01:58,230 --> 01:02:02,060
As long as at you or anything like that?
No, nothing. No, because it's the game.

1096
01:02:02,270 --> 01:02:06,230
So I'm respecting the game. You
know, there's a game, the drug game.

1097
01:02:06,470 --> 01:02:07,970
So I have my role,

1098
01:02:08,030 --> 01:02:12,410
the drug dealer has his role and we're
playing this back and forth and as long

1099
01:02:12,411 --> 01:02:15,200
as we all play by the rules,
everything is fine.

1100
01:02:15,860 --> 01:02:19,650
As soon as the cops stopped playing by
the rules of the game, then you a problem.

1101
01:02:19,651 --> 01:02:22,470
As soon as they stopped playing by the
rules of the game, you have a problem.

1102
01:02:22,940 --> 01:02:27,180
Does, did, did the futility of it all, was
that obvious to, yeah, incredibly obvious.

1103
01:02:27,181 --> 01:02:28,570
There's, there's no point. So we had a,

1104
01:02:28,830 --> 01:02:32,700
I remember a case we had where there was
a group that was selling drugs and we

1105
01:02:32,701 --> 01:02:34,020
worked on it for about a week or two,

1106
01:02:34,170 --> 01:02:38,250
took down the whole group and two days
later there was a whole new crew writing

1107
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:41,100
the exact same neighborhood, throwing
the same product and we were just like,

1108
01:02:41,430 --> 01:02:45,090
fuck, that was pointless. We
just took the all them off.

1109
01:02:45,470 --> 01:02:49,170
There was no point to it whatsoever. And
it was all drugs anyway. It's all trucks.

1110
01:02:49,830 --> 01:02:54,030
Fucking, hey man, everything
is drugs. This, you know,

1111
01:02:54,060 --> 01:02:58,470
if I was a conspiracy theorist,
I kind of been one in the past,

1112
01:02:58,471 --> 01:03:01,500
but I've mostly abandoned that.
But if I was,

1113
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:03,930
I would feel like this is engineered.

1114
01:03:04,260 --> 01:03:09,060
I'd feel like this is just set up to
make sure that these people stay poor,

1115
01:03:09,061 --> 01:03:12,990
that you keep arresting people and you,
you keep this cycle going.

1116
01:03:13,050 --> 01:03:15,810
I don't think you're a conspiracy
theorist, is that, I think you're right.

1117
01:03:16,170 --> 01:03:21,170
Is it because it exists and because the
system sort of feeds off of it or was it

1118
01:03:22,591 --> 01:03:26,280
engineered? I think the prison industrial
complex has a huge role in that.

1119
01:03:26,610 --> 01:03:29,400
So especially with your
privatizing prisons,

1120
01:03:29,550 --> 01:03:32,760
so you're creating a vacancy
for a bed that must be filled.

1121
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:34,050
So who's going to fill that?

1122
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:36,990
So this is where institutionally
racism also comes in.

1123
01:03:37,140 --> 01:03:39,180
I'm not going to fill it with you.
We're not going to fill it with me.

1124
01:03:39,210 --> 01:03:40,170
We're not gonna fit with Jamie.

1125
01:03:40,290 --> 01:03:45,290
Jamie's sketchy looking at him now we're
going to fill it with black people.

1126
01:03:46,141 --> 01:03:47,140
We like the least,
right?

1127
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:50,500
As a society of people that you feel
like you can demonize the easiest.

1128
01:03:51,090 --> 01:03:55,980
When that judge got arrested in
Pennsylvania for sending kids to jail and

1129
01:03:55,981 --> 01:03:57,540
juvenile just for money,

1130
01:03:57,900 --> 01:04:02,900
we really got a view into this world
that I don't think would have a,

1131
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:07,140
I think a lot of people that opened their
eyes, they went, Whoa, a fucking judge.

1132
01:04:07,560 --> 01:04:10,770
Judges can be that bad.
Judges can be so evil,

1133
01:04:10,980 --> 01:04:14,670
but they would ruin a child's life just
so that they could profit off of it.

1134
01:04:15,060 --> 01:04:19,860
But that's essentially what's going on by
keeping the system the way it is today.

1135
01:04:19,860 --> 01:04:23,040
The Baltimore police,
W who was he?

1136
01:04:23,041 --> 01:04:27,480
The head of Baltimore Police Commissioner
and Commissioner, he resigned,

1137
01:04:27,481 --> 01:04:30,030
or was he fired? He was
fired. He was fired.

1138
01:04:30,090 --> 01:04:33,870
And why was he fired because of all
this shit that's going down? Yeah,

1139
01:04:35,220 --> 01:04:38,850
it's a really hard situation
to say. I mean, he's,

1140
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:42,570
he's fired because he never led the
agency. He's never had the agency ever.

1141
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:47,580
We're really don't like outsiders.
So when he comes in here from Oakland,

1142
01:04:47,660 --> 01:04:49,740
from California, now,
if he came from Oakland,

1143
01:04:50,310 --> 01:04:54,130
Oakland's fucked up to Oakland is like
one of the worst police brutalities pots

1144
01:04:54,131 --> 01:04:56,610
and California. You find that
to be coincidental? That,

1145
01:04:56,611 --> 01:04:59,700
and there was an uprising in Oakland and
an uprising in Baltimore to agencies.

1146
01:04:59,701 --> 01:05:03,780
He led this motherfucker. What's
he doing now? Put Him in jail.

1147
01:05:03,810 --> 01:05:06,690
How about that cle lasts, you know, you
don't think it's gonna happen to you,

1148
01:05:07,410 --> 01:05:12,360
is it? No. No. Um, so what is his
name again? This guy, Anthony Batts.

1149
01:05:12,570 --> 01:05:15,510
And what did he do that was fucked up?
He just never had the agency.

1150
01:05:15,511 --> 01:05:18,040
So every never take,
you

1151
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:18,873
can't.

1152
01:05:19,120 --> 01:05:24,120
So they come in and they come in with
these ideals of what it's like in

1153
01:05:24,191 --> 01:05:27,820
Baltimore and they don't know what it's
like in Baltimore because he knows what

1154
01:05:27,821 --> 01:05:31,960
it's like in Oakland. And
there's, hey Mel. I mean
hypothetically, barely. It barely,

1155
01:05:31,961 --> 01:05:36,490
it seems. Um, so they come in with
these, just these ideals and this,

1156
01:05:36,491 --> 01:05:39,810
uh, I don't know, aura and they're
never going to get us. Like,

1157
01:05:39,820 --> 01:05:44,110
they're never going to get us to follow
them. So it doesn't matter what he does,

1158
01:05:44,111 --> 01:05:46,900
we're not going to follow him.
He doesn't, he after the riots,

1159
01:05:46,901 --> 01:05:51,901
he said he should have trusted his
instincts and done more than 10 to rely on

1160
01:05:52,181 --> 01:05:53,490
his commanders.
Thank you.

1161
01:05:53,500 --> 01:05:56,470
You just threw your commanders under
the bus and public and you think this

1162
01:05:56,471 --> 01:05:58,540
agency is going to follow you.
What are you kidding me?

1163
01:05:58,570 --> 01:06:01,900
So he's a politician says they're all are.
That's one of our problems.

1164
01:06:01,901 --> 01:06:04,240
That's why we have to get money out
because we're led by politicians and

1165
01:06:04,241 --> 01:06:05,074
policing.

1166
01:06:06,620 --> 01:06:07,880
What could be done?

1167
01:06:07,940 --> 01:06:12,940
Like if you like let's say this
thing becomes bigger and look,

1168
01:06:13,041 --> 01:06:16,850
I think what you're doing today is very
courageous and you're speaking very

1169
01:06:16,851 --> 01:06:20,250
eloquently and very articulate
and you're honest and, and I,

1170
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:23,870
I really believe you man.
I believe you from the heart 100%

1171
01:06:26,090 --> 01:06:31,090
there's a possibility that people like
you and all these activists that are,

1172
01:06:32,830 --> 01:06:37,790
they're making these giant protests
happen and causing all these people to be

1173
01:06:37,791 --> 01:06:42,710
aware of all this police brutality and
this fucking horrible cycle that these

1174
01:06:42,711 --> 01:06:46,750
people are or thrust into a guide.

1175
01:06:46,751 --> 01:06:49,640
Like you could really change something.

1176
01:06:51,020 --> 01:06:55,270
A guy like you,
if you were in a position of power there,

1177
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:57,980
there might be something
that you could do.

1178
01:06:58,010 --> 01:06:59,690
Would you consider doing
something like that?

1179
01:07:01,040 --> 01:07:06,040
I would consider it if we
had the environment to do
so because it's going to be

1180
01:07:06,801 --> 01:07:11,180
ugly at first because I
can't stop the drug war. It's
not, it's not in my control.

1181
01:07:11,220 --> 01:07:14,280
Well, you shouldn't stop the drug
war. What? Like what? What if,

1182
01:07:14,460 --> 01:07:16,320
this is a big hypothetical,

1183
01:07:16,620 --> 01:07:20,300
but what if we went into some sort of
a situation that's competent in this

1184
01:07:20,310 --> 01:07:22,350
country were drugs became decriminalized,

1185
01:07:22,700 --> 01:07:26,610
where w the United States woke the fuck
up and realized we've been doing the

1186
01:07:26,611 --> 01:07:30,800
same shit that they did during the
fucking twenties during the, you know,

1187
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:33,910
prohibition. We're doing
the same shit. We're,

1188
01:07:34,010 --> 01:07:35,880
we're telling people what they can't do.

1189
01:07:35,881 --> 01:07:38,670
They're not listening and
we're feeding organized crime.

1190
01:07:38,671 --> 01:07:43,671
We're feeding crime that is filling a
vacuum just like it's going on in Mexico

1191
01:07:43,861 --> 01:07:44,610
right now.

1192
01:07:44,610 --> 01:07:47,940
Just like these poor fucking people that
live in these border towns in Mexico.

1193
01:07:48,300 --> 01:07:52,890
The, it's all being fueled by the fact
that drugs are illegal and they're selling

1194
01:07:52,891 --> 01:07:56,220
these drugs to America.
If all of a sudden that changed,

1195
01:07:56,760 --> 01:08:00,420
how much of an impact
would that have on police?

1196
01:08:00,620 --> 01:08:05,090
It, it'd be striking, uh, that, that
again, that's 90% of what I did.

1197
01:08:05,860 --> 01:08:09,530
So if we would stop doing that,
it would be incredibly advantageous.

1198
01:08:09,770 --> 01:08:13,290
But what would they do with you
guys? See what I'm saying? Focus.

1199
01:08:13,290 --> 01:08:16,190
Let's investigate violence. Let's figure
out we're going to fix things. Okay,

1200
01:08:16,280 --> 01:08:18,740
so use some science to say,
we have a problem.

1201
01:08:19,250 --> 01:08:22,280
What do we do to actually
solve this problem?

1202
01:08:22,370 --> 01:08:26,450
Instead of being fueled by ideology?
What are we actually doing?

1203
01:08:27,280 --> 01:08:27,431
Well,

1204
01:08:27,431 --> 01:08:30,850
do you saw this recent thing on Obama's
gonna release all these nonviolent drug

1205
01:08:30,851 --> 01:08:35,680
offenders? I mean, that's a
good step. I concur completely.
That's a great step. Now,

1206
01:08:35,710 --> 01:08:36,610
if he does that,

1207
01:08:37,690 --> 01:08:41,980
and the next step is obviously
not arresting violent,

1208
01:08:42,010 --> 01:08:44,890
nonviolent drug offenders,
not arresting them at all.

1209
01:08:44,940 --> 01:08:49,330
Like there's no more arrest for drugs
unless there's violence involved.

1210
01:08:49,450 --> 01:08:52,450
And then you're arresting someone for
violence, which is totally reasonable.

1211
01:08:52,830 --> 01:08:53,410
It doesn't have,

1212
01:08:53,410 --> 01:08:57,160
it doesn't matter if they're violent over
fucking stuffed animals or cocaine who

1213
01:08:57,161 --> 01:08:59,040
gives a shit. They're violent,
right? They're hurting somebody.

1214
01:08:59,070 --> 01:09:03,040
That's why they're arrested. How much
would that transform neighborhoods?

1215
01:09:03,041 --> 01:09:08,041
How much would that transform this entire
cycle of people going from communities

1216
01:09:09,761 --> 01:09:14,761
that are just engulfed in crime and
becoming a part of that themselves because

1217
01:09:15,251 --> 01:09:17,080
they were unlucky enough to be born there?

1218
01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:20,140
I think it's the biggest
thing we could do as a nation.

1219
01:09:20,410 --> 01:09:23,570
I only put wolf pack and uh,

1220
01:09:23,740 --> 01:09:27,340
getting money out of politics ahead
of it because I questioned that we can

1221
01:09:27,370 --> 01:09:31,090
actually do that as money
continues to fuel the politician

1222
01:09:31,370 --> 01:09:34,160
and wolf pack is what's set up by
the young Turks. Right, right. Yeah.

1223
01:09:34,230 --> 01:09:36,260
Let's just fucking fantastic.
I love that.

1224
01:09:36,710 --> 01:09:40,030
There's another thing that my friend
Steve Hilton put together called Crowdpac

1225
01:09:40,130 --> 01:09:45,130
where you could see exactly which
politicians are being supported by,

1226
01:09:45,590 --> 01:09:48,080
by what, where they're getting
their donations from and just,

1227
01:09:48,440 --> 01:09:50,020
and what they vote on and get,

1228
01:09:50,021 --> 01:09:55,021
get a real clear analysis of
their position based on influence,

1229
01:09:55,161 --> 01:09:57,890
based on the amount of money they're
receiving and where it's coming from.

1230
01:09:58,420 --> 01:10:00,500
So it's all shocking shit because it's,

1231
01:10:00,530 --> 01:10:05,000
I just would hope that as we move
forward as a, as a human race,

1232
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:06,440
as we move forward,

1233
01:10:06,441 --> 01:10:11,441
as a civilization moves forward and we
embrace technology and we understand that

1234
01:10:11,870 --> 01:10:14,990
we have more access to information now
than any human beings that have ever

1235
01:10:14,991 --> 01:10:17,750
lived ever to keep living the same way.

1236
01:10:18,140 --> 01:10:22,520
Even though we have all these obvious
problems right in front of us is

1237
01:10:22,521 --> 01:10:26,780
ridiculous. I mean it's literally
the definition of insanity,

1238
01:10:26,781 --> 01:10:29,840
doing the same thing over and over
again hoping for a different result.

1239
01:10:30,090 --> 01:10:32,000
And that is the definition of insanity.
Right?

1240
01:10:32,130 --> 01:10:36,420
Totally agree. There's this, there's no
way around it that we're doing this wrong.

1241
01:10:36,421 --> 01:10:40,050
And that's why I'm saying the only
reason I'm saying this is because we are

1242
01:10:40,051 --> 01:10:43,330
doing it so wrong and it's
so blatantly wrong. It's,

1243
01:10:43,331 --> 01:10:47,820
it's like you have to have a cognitive
bias to not see this. Like how,

1244
01:10:47,970 --> 01:10:49,950
how the,
it's really the older generation.

1245
01:10:49,951 --> 01:10:52,800
I kind of pretty much confidence that
our generations and younger will be able

1246
01:10:52,801 --> 01:10:54,960
to solve this and once we get in power,

1247
01:10:55,120 --> 01:10:58,590
but how they don't see this now is
absolutely baffling. And I don't,

1248
01:10:58,650 --> 01:11:00,720
I think they don't see it
because it doesn't affect them.

1249
01:11:00,721 --> 01:11:03,210
So why should they care?
Were you

1250
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:04,660
still on the force where the,

1251
01:11:04,690 --> 01:11:06,730
when that guy got choked
to death and Staten Island?

1252
01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:09,760
I don't think I was when I was
Eric Gardner. Yeah, Eric Gardener.

1253
01:11:10,420 --> 01:11:14,010
That one drove me fucking crazy because
there's a video it and you get to see

1254
01:11:14,011 --> 01:11:16,620
the fact that this guy was so innocent.

1255
01:11:16,621 --> 01:11:18,360
There's nothing wrong
with what he was doing.

1256
01:11:18,361 --> 01:11:23,310
And he's just hanging out tax
evasion. Tax evasion. Exactly.

1257
01:11:23,311 --> 01:11:26,130
But the idea that these cops are gonna
choke to death because he's not paying

1258
01:11:26,131 --> 01:11:28,440
taxes on loose cigarettes.
Not only that,

1259
01:11:28,441 --> 01:11:31,820
he didn't even have any loose cigarettes
on them and they wrestled in the ground,

1260
01:11:31,830 --> 01:11:34,100
choked him, and then tried to
say that it wasn't a choke hold.

1261
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:39,560
I mean that one just highlights
the difference between
the way they treated that

1262
01:11:40,111 --> 01:11:44,490
guy versus the way they would treat
one of their own versus it's a clear us

1263
01:11:44,491 --> 01:11:48,780
versus them. And they felt like they could
do that. They could do that. They had,

1264
01:11:49,020 --> 01:11:51,480
the papers were signed,
they had the directive.

1265
01:11:51,481 --> 01:11:56,070
It was obvious that it was within their
boundaries to take this guy and to

1266
01:11:56,071 --> 01:11:59,700
physically assault him and arrest him.
And so they don't have empathy.

1267
01:11:59,800 --> 01:12:03,600
So if you wanted to see them,
empathy, police, we need to be moral.

1268
01:12:03,601 --> 01:12:04,440
We need to be human.

1269
01:12:04,441 --> 01:12:07,650
That's what I'm [inaudible] my main
message is we have to lead with empathy.

1270
01:12:07,651 --> 01:12:12,360
That's the starting point of everything.
So if I'm going after that guy,

1271
01:12:12,450 --> 01:12:16,290
I can immediately see that brother,
there's a law or not.

1272
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:20,040
The idea that I'm going to
take someone's freedom away,

1273
01:12:20,160 --> 01:12:21,570
like they took his life away,

1274
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:25,910
but they were planning to take his
freedom away for essentially nothing in

1275
01:12:25,980 --> 01:12:27,180
stupid tax.

1276
01:12:27,330 --> 01:12:31,530
That's a penny's that he's
providing a service to somebody.

1277
01:12:31,531 --> 01:12:33,570
If you don't have five bucks
and you want a cigarette,

1278
01:12:33,571 --> 01:12:36,040
that guy's a providing a
service. So why don't you, uh,

1279
01:12:36,540 --> 01:12:39,030
let him set up a little booth
and he can take not only that,

1280
01:12:39,031 --> 01:12:43,830
didn't he paid taxes on those
fucking stats? So what? Jesus Christ,

1281
01:12:43,860 --> 01:12:47,530
I mean, you know, he's making a little bit
of a profit, but who gives a shit? Her?

1282
01:12:47,640 --> 01:12:49,470
No one's getting hurt
and no one literally,

1283
01:12:49,471 --> 01:12:53,010
no one's getting hurt and the money
that they could have made just by

1284
01:12:53,011 --> 01:12:57,900
eliminating the drug war in taxes would
make that look like a pittance. It just,

1285
01:12:57,901 --> 01:13:01,740
the amount of taxes they're getting from
Colorado, Colorado is fucking changed.

1286
01:13:02,190 --> 01:13:06,900
I mean, it is morphing right in front of
our eyes and becoming this free utopia.

1287
01:13:06,930 --> 01:13:10,080
Yeah, you got a lot of dirty hippies there
and a lot of fucking homeless people,

1288
01:13:10,260 --> 01:13:13,020
but that's part of the route you're going
to get that they don't bother anybody.

1289
01:13:13,890 --> 01:13:17,970
I mean, they might bother you a little
bit, but whatever. Yeah. Who gives a shit?

1290
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:21,660
I mean that's,
that's why don't conservative see this.

1291
01:13:22,480 --> 01:13:23,313
Why don't these days

1292
01:13:25,320 --> 01:13:28,830
they live in the suburbs then my
neighbors, they want money. I mean,

1293
01:13:28,831 --> 01:13:30,540
that money's going to go
to their schools as well.

1294
01:13:30,550 --> 01:13:33,960
That's going to make it safer for their
kid to go to 4th of July in the city

1295
01:13:33,961 --> 01:13:35,970
that's going to make
it safer for all of us.

1296
01:13:35,971 --> 01:13:40,020
The answer is blatantly obvious that we
must end the war on drugs and we must

1297
01:13:40,021 --> 01:13:43,980
get money out of politics. But we just
sit here with are sitting on our hands.

1298
01:13:44,010 --> 01:13:44,880
Well,
I agree with you,

1299
01:13:44,881 --> 01:13:49,881
but I think you having these kinds of
conversations live online in a forum like

1300
01:13:51,421 --> 01:13:53,610
this where it's going to be
distributed to millions of people.

1301
01:13:53,880 --> 01:13:58,470
You have the opportunity to influence
people that might not see things your way

1302
01:13:58,650 --> 01:14:02,140
because you have a genuine insight in a,
in a,

1303
01:14:02,141 --> 01:14:04,470
in a real perspective
that very few people,

1304
01:14:04,471 --> 01:14:09,000
including me could ever hope to have you
saying this kind of stuff and you talk

1305
01:14:09,001 --> 01:14:12,610
about this kind of stuff can shed some
light in a way that other people can.

1306
01:14:12,611 --> 01:14:14,110
I'm listening to you
talk here, man. I'm like,

1307
01:14:14,111 --> 01:14:16,360
you're the fucking perfect commissioner.
You're the,

1308
01:14:16,630 --> 01:14:20,080
you're the kind of guy that I would
want running a police department. You,

1309
01:14:20,510 --> 01:14:24,310
you're a guy who's been there,
a guy who's served the country,

1310
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:27,850
been there as a cop,
understands what the problems are and,

1311
01:14:27,950 --> 01:14:31,390
and has solutions and has
empathy and really is,

1312
01:14:31,540 --> 01:14:34,750
you're saying all the right shit.
I mean, this is what we need.

1313
01:14:34,780 --> 01:14:38,560
This is what the police of the departments
of the world of this country at least

1314
01:14:38,710 --> 01:14:40,210
need.
We need someone like you.

1315
01:14:40,600 --> 01:14:45,130
So how do I convince other cops of
that? That's, that's my struggle.

1316
01:14:45,370 --> 01:14:48,160
I don't know man. I mean, I know a lot
of cops listen to the fucking podcast.

1317
01:14:48,161 --> 01:14:51,140
I'll tell you that I, I mean, I dunno
if this is going to change them,

1318
01:14:51,141 --> 01:14:55,120
but they're going to fucking Joe Rogan's
hi. Listen in on the streets with us,

1319
01:14:55,121 --> 01:14:58,730
dude. But you know, you've seen the
blue, the blue light sticker, right? Yes.

1320
01:14:58,731 --> 01:15:00,340
The black on the top,
black on the bottom.

1321
01:15:00,610 --> 01:15:03,670
So we even visualize
ourselves the wrong way.

1322
01:15:03,730 --> 01:15:07,270
So we're this thin blue line and the
thin blue line goes to the middle and it

1323
01:15:07,271 --> 01:15:11,830
separates the good guys from the bad guys.
And it makes us neither.

1324
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:15,220
Our entire mentality is that we
are somebody that's separate.

1325
01:15:15,221 --> 01:15:19,450
We're not the good guys or the bad guys.
We're a separate entity that,

1326
01:15:19,500 --> 01:15:23,200
that runs this shit and, but
that, that shouldn't be that way.

1327
01:15:23,201 --> 01:15:25,390
There should be like a
blurred blue and black.

1328
01:15:25,391 --> 01:15:28,270
We should be part of the fabric
of our society and we should,

1329
01:15:28,510 --> 01:15:30,460
we should be ingrained in it.

1330
01:15:30,760 --> 01:15:34,240
But instead we Fitch
ourselves like a wall.

1331
01:15:34,780 --> 01:15:36,160
And we shouldn't be a wall.

1332
01:15:36,620 --> 01:15:40,280
I think human beings inherently
have a problem with power. You know?

1333
01:15:40,340 --> 01:15:42,950
That's why you see,
I mean,

1334
01:15:42,951 --> 01:15:47,870
you see it across the board when people
have power and influence over people

1335
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:51,320
alike, it seems to be a natural
inclination to abuse it.

1336
01:15:51,650 --> 01:15:55,880
And it takes someone a very strong
character and insight and objectivity like

1337
01:15:55,881 --> 01:15:57,530
yourself to not do that.

1338
01:15:57,920 --> 01:16:02,210
Or at least to recognize that you have
done that and that it is wrong or that it

1339
01:16:02,211 --> 01:16:03,044
was wrong.

1340
01:16:03,350 --> 01:16:08,030
It seems to me that like whether it's
politicians or whether it's the military

1341
01:16:08,031 --> 01:16:11,630
or whether it's, what are some of the
like fucking Bill Cosby, you know,

1342
01:16:11,660 --> 01:16:16,100
like how does a guy become that guy?
Well, I eat has to be out of power,

1343
01:16:16,520 --> 01:16:19,280
you know?
I mean it's the power even even just

1344
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:23,910
might be a stretch, but the
power to drug someone, the,

1345
01:16:24,170 --> 01:16:29,050
the ability to do that and yeah,
if it's like how, what it is,

1346
01:16:29,090 --> 01:16:34,090
what is it about human beings that that
makes them exploiting people that are

1347
01:16:34,881 --> 01:16:39,650
below them instead of trying to
raise those people up to their level.

1348
01:16:39,950 --> 01:16:44,540
There's some fundamental lack of
understanding about the brotherhood and

1349
01:16:44,541 --> 01:16:47,630
sisterhood of the human race that gets,

1350
01:16:47,930 --> 01:16:50,690
it all gets fucked up when you have a job.

1351
01:16:50,960 --> 01:16:55,160
And it seems to me that if you have
a quota and if you have a boss that's

1352
01:16:55,161 --> 01:16:59,690
telling you you need to arrest more
people, you need to lock up more people.

1353
01:16:59,810 --> 01:17:02,330
Like these streets are too safe.
You're either,

1354
01:17:02,870 --> 01:17:07,640
either you're doing the right
thing or you're not doing enough.

1355
01:17:07,790 --> 01:17:10,140
And they almost always think
not doing enough. Right.

1356
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:12,410
They never would think,
oh,

1357
01:17:12,411 --> 01:17:16,040
this guy got lucky and he created a good
relationship with all these people and

1358
01:17:16,041 --> 01:17:19,550
we locked up all the bad guys and all
the people in the community that are left

1359
01:17:19,551 --> 01:17:22,400
are all safe.
There's no more violent criminals.

1360
01:17:22,550 --> 01:17:25,550
It's a beautiful utopia of a neighborhood.
And we never,

1361
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:28,530
never have to arrest anybody there ever
again. So cops would just be there,

1362
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:32,210
just sorta say hi and patrol the streets.
Yeah,

1363
01:17:32,240 --> 01:17:37,130
that sounds like a great idea. And, but
you see it, you see that. So you see it.

1364
01:17:37,220 --> 01:17:39,110
So the first step is to recognize it.

1365
01:17:39,320 --> 01:17:43,370
It's so do we have a problem with power
we have as human beings? Maybe we do.

1366
01:17:43,550 --> 01:17:48,260
So let's acknowledge that and put measures
in place so that we don't exceed our

1367
01:17:48,261 --> 01:17:51,230
power boundaries have some checks and
balances in law enforcement because we

1368
01:17:51,231 --> 01:17:52,310
have zero.

1369
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:56,420
We did away with everything we want to
get away with until there's a camera.

1370
01:17:56,870 --> 01:17:59,810
The only difference, all these other
things that you've seen in the past.

1371
01:17:59,811 --> 01:18:02,270
You've heard these stories
of guys getting shot unarmed,

1372
01:18:02,271 --> 01:18:05,120
but yet he was attacking my
gun or he was taking my gun.

1373
01:18:05,150 --> 01:18:07,010
How much do you really believe those now?

1374
01:18:07,040 --> 01:18:10,460
Well we saw that the one where the guy
in South Carolina shot the guy in the

1375
01:18:10,461 --> 01:18:11,720
back and then drop the Taser,

1376
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:14,840
walked up to him and through
the Taser down near his body.

1377
01:18:14,841 --> 01:18:16,730
I mean there's drops anything.
There's a video of it.

1378
01:18:16,760 --> 01:18:19,090
I don't know if the other cops
saw it. I don't know. I'll do it.

1379
01:18:19,100 --> 01:18:19,933
It's right in front of them.

1380
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:24,140
You saw them doing nothing of it cause
it's video cause it's normal. It's normal.

1381
01:18:24,170 --> 01:18:27,200
We're not the only saw.
The one guy is the other guy in the video.

1382
01:18:27,200 --> 01:18:31,040
The other guys see the Taser cause
it's obvious that he sees it.

1383
01:18:31,080 --> 01:18:34,100
I mean he's the first stand right next
to him on he, I don't, I don't know.

1384
01:18:34,340 --> 01:18:37,310
But the fact that he shot him in
the back while I was running away,

1385
01:18:37,850 --> 01:18:39,980
I mean that's kind of fucking crazy.
It's crazy.

1386
01:18:40,310 --> 01:18:43,130
Is that guys being charged for
murder, right? Yeah. Well that's nice.

1387
01:18:43,230 --> 01:18:47,060
But it's because anybody, right?
Nobody ride it there. Why?

1388
01:18:47,440 --> 01:18:50,420
Because they don't get all, they're
all booked. All of the uprising.

1389
01:18:51,350 --> 01:18:55,610
Deray was booked things.
What happened with Deray?

1390
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:59,740
You got them to not this guy,
deray is a,

1391
01:18:59,900 --> 01:19:04,850
a really noble activist and I appreciate
everything this guy is doing and I

1392
01:19:04,851 --> 01:19:08,990
appreciated him, uh, making Wolf
Blitzer look like a fucking idiot on TV.

1393
01:19:09,470 --> 01:19:12,950
But uh, he had me blocked for some
reason, but you got them to unblock me.

1394
01:19:13,010 --> 01:19:17,330
I got them to unblock you. What?
I think it's totally conjecture,

1395
01:19:17,660 --> 01:19:22,190
but I think he's just leery of us. And
I understand that white people, us,

1396
01:19:22,260 --> 01:19:27,020
we're in the same group. Yeah,
I think so. And He's white.

1397
01:19:27,240 --> 01:19:29,570
He blocked me because I'm white.
That that has something to do. No,

1398
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:32,540
his blocking has something to do with
something. He thought that you said.

1399
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:35,830
What do you think? I said, I don't
remember. But how can you remember that?

1400
01:19:35,840 --> 01:19:38,960
Now you're gonna have to talk to him.
Okay. You can't say it. No, I mean,

1401
01:19:39,130 --> 01:19:42,220
I just don't know enough and I didn't
dig. It was just not my business. Okay.

1402
01:19:43,070 --> 01:19:45,650
So he thought I said something racist.
I don't know what he thought he said.

1403
01:19:45,651 --> 01:19:48,080
He said he thought you said something
that he didn't, you didn't like.

1404
01:19:48,081 --> 01:19:52,160
And I just said, you know,
trust me, he's fine. He's,
he's, he's one of the good guys.

1405
01:19:52,161 --> 01:19:56,630
Don't worry about it. Okay. Maybe I said
a joke. Even my said something off color.

1406
01:19:56,690 --> 01:19:58,550
It's always hard with being a comedian,
man.

1407
01:19:59,420 --> 01:20:02,900
Maybe heard me talk about Trans
racialism and how I support it.

1408
01:20:03,800 --> 01:20:07,800
I think he's probably a little brief
on that. And so like, should be,

1409
01:20:08,220 --> 01:20:11,040
but why not? Fuck it. He's a
good guy and I hope things,

1410
01:20:11,041 --> 01:20:15,500
but I know his lack of trust.
Well, I understand. I guess. Um,

1411
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:18,630
but I understand not, not, I don't
understand this lack of trust in me.

1412
01:20:19,110 --> 01:20:21,990
I just don't understand
that I'm so trustworthy,

1413
01:20:22,380 --> 01:20:25,380
but I understand what he's doing
and I think it's spectacular.

1414
01:20:25,381 --> 01:20:29,940
He to me is a real activist as opposed
to Al Sharpton who just makes my fucking

1415
01:20:29,941 --> 01:20:30,900
blood curdle.

1416
01:20:31,200 --> 01:20:34,710
When I see that guy show up at any
fucking event that has anything to do with

1417
01:20:34,711 --> 01:20:36,600
black people at was Jesus fucking Christ.

1418
01:20:36,830 --> 01:20:39,000
Like I got this more
harm than he does good.

1419
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:44,360
Just by his just greasy past
is history and they just,

1420
01:20:44,730 --> 01:20:49,560
there's so much about him that's just so
wrong and it's nice to see someone like

1421
01:20:49,561 --> 01:20:52,710
deray come along.
It's nice to see a real activist.

1422
01:20:52,711 --> 01:20:55,530
Someone who is intelligent,
is articulate,

1423
01:20:55,531 --> 01:21:00,531
is doing all the right things and
I think between a guy like that,

1424
01:21:01,050 --> 01:21:03,060
but trying to,
between many people I can,

1425
01:21:03,061 --> 01:21:05,310
I'm sure there's a lot more people
like him that I'm not aware of.

1426
01:21:05,640 --> 01:21:09,240
And then someone like you who shedding
light on this from the inside.

1427
01:21:09,690 --> 01:21:12,840
I think things are slowly
but surely turning.

1428
01:21:12,841 --> 01:21:16,380
I think the battleship is moving in
a different direction. I really do.

1429
01:21:16,830 --> 01:21:19,530
I really think the whole country
is moving in a different direction.

1430
01:21:19,770 --> 01:21:24,770
And I think that when we see the way
people are approaching gay rights now,

1431
01:21:25,740 --> 01:21:27,540
the way this,

1432
01:21:27,570 --> 01:21:30,780
the way the world is just
more sensitive about things.

1433
01:21:30,781 --> 01:21:34,050
And some people are angry at it as
saying everyone's over-sensitive.

1434
01:21:34,710 --> 01:21:39,180
I think it's probably better to be over
sensitive than it to be insensitive

1435
01:21:39,300 --> 01:21:42,470
cause over sensitive can be
corrected. And people were like, well,

1436
01:21:42,471 --> 01:21:43,650
the people who are,
you know,

1437
01:21:43,651 --> 01:21:46,020
there's lives are being ruined because
people were being over sensitive.

1438
01:21:46,410 --> 01:21:51,150
You know, there was a Nobel prize
winning doctor or a professor that,

1439
01:21:51,210 --> 01:21:52,043
um,

1440
01:21:52,050 --> 01:21:57,050
made a joke about women in science and
he said they should probably have a same

1441
01:21:57,841 --> 01:22:02,520
sex labs because, uh, three things
happen when women are in the labs.

1442
01:22:02,820 --> 01:22:03,121
He said,

1443
01:22:03,121 --> 01:22:07,080
either they fall in love with you or you
fall in love with them or they cry when

1444
01:22:07,081 --> 01:22:07,914
you criticize them.

1445
01:22:08,130 --> 01:22:13,130
And he was joking around against
allegedly and he had to resign.

1446
01:22:13,800 --> 01:22:16,110
He had to resign for that, for
something like that. You know,

1447
01:22:16,111 --> 01:22:18,770
they say equality and science
is more important like that,

1448
01:22:18,771 --> 01:22:21,150
that mother curing cancer.
All right,

1449
01:22:21,151 --> 01:22:25,260
this guy's a Nobel prize winning scientist
and he says something that's a little

1450
01:22:25,261 --> 01:22:27,330
goofy but it doesn't have
some history of oppression.

1451
01:22:27,540 --> 01:22:29,010
He's not some terrible person is.

1452
01:22:29,310 --> 01:22:34,310
It's this massive over sensitivity
by people where you can't even just,

1453
01:22:35,340 --> 01:22:38,980
you know, say that's probably not a
good thing to say. And He, you know,

1454
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:41,970
can kind of correct it and you can kind
of smooth it out cause you understand

1455
01:22:41,971 --> 01:22:44,070
the people talk off the top of their head.

1456
01:22:44,190 --> 01:22:49,190
This is not like a fucking story wrote
for the New York Times where he made it

1457
01:22:49,990 --> 01:22:54,360
had a clear position on women in science
and it became a real issue because he

1458
01:22:54,361 --> 01:22:57,750
criticized people that might have gotten
into science and done some real good

1459
01:22:57,751 --> 01:23:00,420
work. Now this guy, the
guy's just talking, you know,

1460
01:23:00,600 --> 01:23:03,650
and I think symptoms like that,
like the,

1461
01:23:03,651 --> 01:23:05,650
these issues that we face,

1462
01:23:06,130 --> 01:23:09,670
it's way better to have the APP
than it is to have insensitivity.

1463
01:23:09,880 --> 01:23:12,910
I think the over sensitive
things like that, it's, it
sucks at this guy got fired,

1464
01:23:12,911 --> 01:23:16,720
but, or that he resigned but he shouldn't
have. And I buy, I blame the institution.

1465
01:23:16,721 --> 01:23:19,270
I blamed the people running for that,
that are so fucking sensitive that they,

1466
01:23:19,540 --> 01:23:23,470
they, and, and so terrified that they're
worried about any criticism whatsoever,

1467
01:23:23,471 --> 01:23:26,050
that they reacted to it
and this way and him,

1468
01:23:26,290 --> 01:23:28,150
he shouldn't have fucking
back down from it.

1469
01:23:28,151 --> 01:23:31,820
Either he's going to talked about it
and explained or maybe an apologize.

1470
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:34,090
Maybe you even said it was an
off color joke or it was just,

1471
01:23:34,720 --> 01:23:38,890
I just think that that balance is,

1472
01:23:38,950 --> 01:23:42,670
is because we're moving in the right
direction. I really do. I think I,

1473
01:23:42,730 --> 01:23:46,960
even though I've been a victim of over
sensitivity, um, I shouldn't say victim.

1474
01:23:46,960 --> 01:23:50,040
That's sounds very
grandiose. I, it's, it's,

1475
01:23:50,050 --> 01:23:53,800
it's affected me or it's impacted me
or I've felt it. I've seen it rather,

1476
01:23:54,700 --> 01:23:55,570
I think it's better.

1477
01:23:55,840 --> 01:23:59,140
It's better to have all those fucking
crazy people running around looking at

1478
01:23:59,141 --> 01:24:01,720
things to be offended about looking at a,
you know,

1479
01:24:01,870 --> 01:24:06,070
examples of sexism or
homophobia or racism. It's,

1480
01:24:06,071 --> 01:24:10,360
it's better to have people reaching
too far than to not reach it all.

1481
01:24:10,540 --> 01:24:12,430
And I think because we're
seeing all this stuff,

1482
01:24:12,760 --> 01:24:16,750
I think it's evidence that
society as a whole than our,

1483
01:24:16,930 --> 01:24:20,860
our culture in America is
tipping towards being more aware.

1484
01:24:21,250 --> 01:24:25,540
And I think that's a good thing. I really
do. Um, I have a lot of hope, you know,

1485
01:24:25,541 --> 01:24:26,760
a lot of people think that I'm like,
well,

1486
01:24:26,761 --> 01:24:31,300
overly optimistic about the future of
this country and the human beings in

1487
01:24:31,301 --> 01:24:32,134
general.

1488
01:24:32,290 --> 01:24:37,290
But I'd see plenty of evidence that people
are aware and that they care and just

1489
01:24:37,630 --> 01:24:41,710
all the people that are paying attention
to your story and all these different

1490
01:24:42,040 --> 01:24:45,690
protests and marches and all these
different news stories when any,

1491
01:24:45,730 --> 01:24:49,250
whenever we see these examples
of police brutality, it's,

1492
01:24:49,450 --> 01:24:53,650
there's so highlighted now,
this is not swept under the rug at all.

1493
01:24:54,070 --> 01:24:58,330
And if anything, the cops are fucking
thrown under the bus immediately. I mean,

1494
01:24:58,331 --> 01:24:58,571
is it,

1495
01:24:58,571 --> 01:25:02,500
it's a different world and I think
there's going to be an adjustment period.

1496
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:06,340
But I think ultimately when
we look back at this time,

1497
01:25:06,520 --> 01:25:10,210
10 20 years from now, I think we're
going to look at this as a shift,

1498
01:25:10,480 --> 01:25:14,800
as a shift in our culture that we
didn't see in the 60s you know, there's,

1499
01:25:14,920 --> 01:25:17,500
when I think when the,

1500
01:25:17,501 --> 01:25:21,190
when Martin Luther King was
around and when there was a shift,

1501
01:25:21,191 --> 01:25:25,330
then there was most certainly a, an a,
an awareness, a civil rights awareness.

1502
01:25:26,200 --> 01:25:28,180
But I think it's even bigger now.
I really do.

1503
01:25:28,840 --> 01:25:31,270
I think this is a great
time to be a human being.

1504
01:25:31,720 --> 01:25:36,720
I really think that we have the real
potential to make some real change inside

1505
01:25:37,330 --> 01:25:42,330
our lifetime and change that
can give momentum to the future.

1506
01:25:43,340 --> 01:25:45,440
I think there's, without question
that you're completely right,

1507
01:25:46,310 --> 01:25:50,750
they can't avoid it. I mean we're, we're,
technology has made us communicate.

1508
01:25:50,900 --> 01:25:53,750
We see everything.
We can't hide as much anymore.

1509
01:25:53,840 --> 01:25:58,490
We just have to be human and recognize
all of our flaws and everything will be

1510
01:25:58,491 --> 01:25:59,780
fine with your doctor.

1511
01:25:59,930 --> 01:26:04,100
If we could have some empathy for his
position because empathy a two way street,

1512
01:26:04,250 --> 01:26:09,050
then maybe you can work out a solution
for understanding and that ball game and

1513
01:26:09,051 --> 01:26:11,810
that's what we're doing now is where
we're working out the understanding and

1514
01:26:11,811 --> 01:26:15,350
it's going to have this ugly
period in policing for sure,

1515
01:26:15,680 --> 01:26:17,870
but we'll get through it and it's
going to be better. It's inevitable.

1516
01:26:17,871 --> 01:26:20,870
I don't think it's me. It's going
to be somebody that comes behind me,

1517
01:26:21,140 --> 01:26:22,640
but it's going to,
it's going to work

1518
01:26:22,770 --> 01:26:26,010
well. Yeah, I think you're a part of
it. Uh, I think we're all a part of it.

1519
01:26:26,160 --> 01:26:29,340
I think someone like you is uniquely
qualified to be a part of it. You know,

1520
01:26:29,341 --> 01:26:30,840
the fact that you actually,

1521
01:26:30,870 --> 01:26:35,040
or they're on the street arresting
dude is wearing somebody else's pants.

1522
01:26:35,430 --> 01:26:40,320
I think it just shows you're uniquely
qualified to talk about this.

1523
01:26:40,830 --> 01:26:45,830
And I think that there's a real potential
with this kind of dialogue and with

1524
01:26:47,070 --> 01:26:51,480
people just being more and more aware of
it that a young kid that might be like

1525
01:26:51,481 --> 01:26:55,200
1617 years old right now that is about
to go into the marines and has the same

1526
01:26:55,201 --> 01:26:58,230
idea that you had.
He has a leg up.

1527
01:26:58,680 --> 01:27:03,680
Maybe he can learn from your experiences
and maybe his comrades and maybe his,

1528
01:27:04,741 --> 01:27:09,741
his peers can also learn from what you're
saying and your experiences and maybe

1529
01:27:09,961 --> 01:27:14,130
someone like you one day
becomes a commissioner and
maybe that time while that's

1530
01:27:14,131 --> 01:27:19,131
happening that that one
commissioner starts listening
to good politicians and it

1531
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:25,260
gets influenced by good
leaders and doesn't have to
start arresting people just

1532
01:27:25,261 --> 01:27:26,094
for drugs,

1533
01:27:26,140 --> 01:27:31,140
doesn't have to PR just perpetrate this
same stupid fucking cycle that's been

1534
01:27:31,471 --> 01:27:33,600
going on and on.
I mean is that too much to ask?

1535
01:27:33,601 --> 01:27:37,110
Is that too unrealistic to
hope that we can change things?

1536
01:27:37,680 --> 01:27:39,480
I mean you can't,

1537
01:27:39,950 --> 01:27:43,300
you can't think that we're not going
to improve if we're not going to,

1538
01:27:43,430 --> 01:27:47,190
we're going to stay stagnant as a
culture. Well that's, that's ridiculous.

1539
01:27:47,191 --> 01:27:50,190
That's shitty engineering.
That's non non thinking.

1540
01:27:50,191 --> 01:27:52,620
That's are you always
saying that we're perfect?

1541
01:27:52,960 --> 01:27:54,900
Are we saying that it's few tile?

1542
01:27:55,130 --> 01:27:58,350
Are we saying that it can't be fixed or
are we saying that we're not willing to

1543
01:27:58,351 --> 01:28:00,960
try?
One of the one of those is happening.

1544
01:28:01,430 --> 01:28:05,810
The majority is not willing
to try but you even,

1545
01:28:06,350 --> 01:28:07,930
I don't think I belong on the pedestal.

1546
01:28:07,931 --> 01:28:11,510
You're put me on maybe somebody else wants
because I participated in all of this.

1547
01:28:11,910 --> 01:28:13,170
Maybe we can have people that go on.

1548
01:28:13,600 --> 01:28:18,040
It's on a pedestal. I'm not putting you
on a pedestal. I'm just saying your, your,

1549
01:28:18,041 --> 01:28:22,570
your, your hope, what
you're doing. This is hope.

1550
01:28:23,530 --> 01:28:24,520
You

1551
01:28:24,940 --> 01:28:27,160
influenced that though with this.
Okay,

1552
01:28:27,161 --> 01:28:31,690
so you have this philosophy where you
were like it doesn't matter what you do,

1553
01:28:31,720 --> 01:28:36,520
just fucking be nice. Just be nice and
listening to youth through these years,

1554
01:28:36,610 --> 01:28:38,500
that has invaded my mind as well.

1555
01:28:38,501 --> 01:28:43,501
So if we can just talk and start
opening up as humans and be nice and be

1556
01:28:44,621 --> 01:28:47,980
empathetic, then we're going to work
that all of this out regardless.

1557
01:28:47,981 --> 01:28:50,590
Bernie Sanders might even
be a good example of that
with his message right now.

1558
01:28:51,040 --> 01:28:55,300
Huge following. Right. And
like vote for this guy. Yeah.

1559
01:28:55,330 --> 01:28:57,520
I mean we're going to make changes.

1560
01:28:57,550 --> 01:29:01,410
It's like if you're a progressive
then you want to make changes.

1561
01:29:01,560 --> 01:29:02,730
If you're a conservative,

1562
01:29:02,790 --> 01:29:05,580
you want to stay in the past.
This is what these words mean.

1563
01:29:05,760 --> 01:29:06,960
It doesn't make any sense.

1564
01:29:07,020 --> 01:29:09,600
Who would want to be conservative
and stuck in the past?

1565
01:29:09,601 --> 01:29:12,540
The only person is going to be stuck in
a past is one with the confederate flag

1566
01:29:12,600 --> 01:29:14,850
that's collecting money off
the backs of somebody else.

1567
01:29:15,150 --> 01:29:18,720
Well this a definition of conservative,
I think it's all fucked up.

1568
01:29:18,721 --> 01:29:22,100
Now conservative should be someone
who's fiscally conservative.

1569
01:29:22,101 --> 01:29:23,910
That and then the,
which is someone who's prudent,

1570
01:29:24,180 --> 01:29:27,000
someone it makes good financial choices.
That's a good thing.

1571
01:29:27,001 --> 01:29:29,550
That's a smart thing.
It's someone with discipline that's,

1572
01:29:29,580 --> 01:29:31,950
I support that 100% you know,

1573
01:29:31,951 --> 01:29:35,190
good financial decisions or
that is a conservative thing.

1574
01:29:35,550 --> 01:29:39,150
You know when you start getting socially
conservative that means you're white.

1575
01:29:40,230 --> 01:29:43,170
That's what it means. You might as
well say you're white, you know,

1576
01:29:43,350 --> 01:29:44,370
or you're a black guy.

1577
01:29:44,371 --> 01:29:46,770
He likes hanging out with white people
and being paid more than he's worth.

1578
01:29:47,610 --> 01:29:50,220
Cause you know, that's
what happens. I mean it's,

1579
01:29:50,820 --> 01:29:55,820
we live in a weird world right now and
I think society is being redefined right

1580
01:29:56,101 --> 01:29:59,130
in front of our eyes.
I think when we look back at this time,

1581
01:29:59,580 --> 01:30:02,220
a hundred years from now,
when people look back when we're dead,

1582
01:30:02,550 --> 01:30:05,640
they're going to look back and go,
guys, a fucking crazy time to be alive.

1583
01:30:05,670 --> 01:30:08,670
That Internet just fucking threw a
monkey wrench into the whole gears.

1584
01:30:09,090 --> 01:30:12,570
Kaklink you know, I mean that's
really what's happening. The, this,

1585
01:30:12,571 --> 01:30:16,200
this ability to communicate just didn't
exist before you being able to come on a

1586
01:30:16,201 --> 01:30:20,530
show like this. This is never, this wasn't
supposed to happen. No, not at all. If we,

1587
01:30:20,540 --> 01:30:22,980
if this show was on the
radio or something like that,

1588
01:30:23,400 --> 01:30:26,760
first of all we'd be interrupted by
commercials and then second of all,

1589
01:30:26,761 --> 01:30:29,580
someone will probably tell us we can't
talk about these things or we can't talk

1590
01:30:29,581 --> 01:30:32,070
about like the way we're talking.
You can't swear.

1591
01:30:32,071 --> 01:30:35,250
We had already been arrested for swearing.
You can get a fucking fine,

1592
01:30:35,251 --> 01:30:36,450
have some insane amount.

1593
01:30:36,451 --> 01:30:41,040
I think it's like $250,000 for
swearing on the radio for swearing.

1594
01:30:41,310 --> 01:30:43,710
Like just saying,
get the fuck outta here on the radio.

1595
01:30:43,920 --> 01:30:46,530
You can go to jail if you don't pay that,
fine.

1596
01:30:46,531 --> 01:30:48,420
If you don't pay that
quarter million dollar fine.

1597
01:30:48,720 --> 01:30:52,620
The vig to the government that they,
that's where Howard stern came in. Man,

1598
01:30:52,621 --> 01:30:54,270
Howard stern fought all that shit.

1599
01:30:54,271 --> 01:30:56,160
That's why that guy is always
going to be a hero to me.

1600
01:30:56,550 --> 01:31:00,030
I don't give a fuck what he says about
podcasting or Ari should fear already

1601
01:31:00,031 --> 01:31:02,430
that crazy shit that
it wasn't for that guy.

1602
01:31:02,431 --> 01:31:06,810
That guy fought the fight
and the powers that be,

1603
01:31:06,811 --> 01:31:08,760
that have set this stupid thing up.

1604
01:31:09,030 --> 01:31:12,150
They didn't anticipate that a guy like
you would be able to go on the young

1605
01:31:12,151 --> 01:31:15,360
Turks later this afternoon
and say anything you want man,

1606
01:31:15,570 --> 01:31:19,050
and that young Turks thing will be
seen by fucking million people. Easy.

1607
01:31:19,530 --> 01:31:22,410
And that's, that's hope, man. That's hope.

1608
01:31:22,411 --> 01:31:27,150
Because what we're talking about where
you listen to some of the things that

1609
01:31:27,151 --> 01:31:30,750
I've said, those things that I've said
I've heard online, you know I've read,

1610
01:31:31,020 --> 01:31:33,000
I've watched documentaries, I've, I've,

1611
01:31:33,110 --> 01:31:37,470
I'm expressing things that I've learned
and we all learn from each other and we,

1612
01:31:37,471 --> 01:31:42,471
all the community that we create by
finding likeminded people or by saying

1613
01:31:44,041 --> 01:31:47,700
things that resonate with people or by
influencing people in a positive way

1614
01:31:47,701 --> 01:31:51,000
where it actually helps their mindset
and helps their life and they become

1615
01:31:51,001 --> 01:31:51,840
thankful of that.

1616
01:31:51,841 --> 01:31:54,690
And then they spread the same kind of
message and we help spread it to each

1617
01:31:54,691 --> 01:31:57,600
other. And I could have a guy like you
want and you change the way I think about

1618
01:31:57,601 --> 01:31:59,720
certain things and you influence.
Like I'm,

1619
01:31:59,721 --> 01:32:03,310
I'm genuinely honored to have
you on the show. I'm genuinely,

1620
01:32:03,420 --> 01:32:06,670
I really admire what you've
done and what you're saying.

1621
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:10,540
And I think other people will as well.
And I think it spreads,

1622
01:32:10,541 --> 01:32:15,490
it's like a good virus.
Like it gets out there and this,

1623
01:32:15,520 --> 01:32:19,420
this wasn't available before.
Something like this wasn't available.

1624
01:32:19,870 --> 01:32:24,370
And I think that's part of why we all
got locked into this US versus them

1625
01:32:24,610 --> 01:32:25,443
mentality.

1626
01:32:25,690 --> 01:32:30,690
We didn't have a voice that distinguishes
or differentiates from the fucking

1627
01:32:30,791 --> 01:32:34,270
same bullshit corporate voice that we
keep hearing over and over and over again.

1628
01:32:34,510 --> 01:32:37,690
That doesn't differentiate. You
don't hear any, you don't hear any.

1629
01:32:37,691 --> 01:32:41,470
We are all brothers and sisters
on Fox News. You don't hear that.

1630
01:32:41,560 --> 01:32:44,890
What do you hear? You hear
crimes, statistics. You know,

1631
01:32:44,891 --> 01:32:49,750
you hear Nancy grace with two
Chainz debating about marijuana.

1632
01:32:50,260 --> 01:32:53,950
I mean he really, that's what you
hear. You hear bullshit nonsense.

1633
01:32:54,340 --> 01:32:58,450
You don't hear any soul. You know,
no one's got a goddamn heart, no one,

1634
01:32:58,750 --> 01:33:02,680
no one recognizes the fact that
this is a temporary existence.

1635
01:33:03,100 --> 01:33:06,730
We're going through a temporary
existence and there are so many of us and

1636
01:33:06,731 --> 01:33:11,110
there's pockets that seem
almost unmanageable because
they've been fucked over

1637
01:33:11,111 --> 01:33:16,111
for hundreds of years and there's just
a swarming chaos in these areas and they

1638
01:33:16,691 --> 01:33:21,640
just, they're riding a
momentum and they're riding on
the momentum of decades and

1639
01:33:21,640 --> 01:33:26,640
decades of poverty and crime and a cycle
of despair and is going to be hard to

1640
01:33:27,611 --> 01:33:28,444
fix that shit.

1641
01:33:28,540 --> 01:33:32,500
But it's critical and it's one of the most
important aspects of our civilization.

1642
01:33:32,950 --> 01:33:35,680
If we don't fix that,
our civilization is nonsense.

1643
01:33:35,950 --> 01:33:38,500
Our civilization is only as
strong as the weakest links.

1644
01:33:38,830 --> 01:33:41,500
And it just makes sense to me.
And I've always said this,

1645
01:33:41,860 --> 01:33:45,280
the best way to strengthen America. People
want to talk about a strong America.

1646
01:33:45,400 --> 01:33:50,290
Are you a patriot? Do you love
America? Good, less losers,

1647
01:33:50,530 --> 01:33:53,110
make less losers.
Then you have a stronger America.

1648
01:33:53,230 --> 01:33:55,420
Go to the fucking
neighborhoods that are fucked.

1649
01:33:55,690 --> 01:33:57,310
Go to the communities that are fucked.

1650
01:33:57,520 --> 01:34:02,520
Go to these deeply entrenched
in crime areas and fix them.

1651
01:34:04,030 --> 01:34:05,890
You fix them.
Then you got winners.

1652
01:34:06,190 --> 01:34:09,040
You got instead of 10,000 people in jail,

1653
01:34:09,130 --> 01:34:11,350
he got 10,000 people that are
starting small businesses.

1654
01:34:11,530 --> 01:34:15,130
You've got 10,000 people
that are venturing out into
the world and trying to do

1655
01:34:15,131 --> 01:34:19,030
good and influencing other people to
do the same and spreading a positive

1656
01:34:19,031 --> 01:34:22,900
message and and influencing people
with inspiration. And then they,

1657
01:34:23,060 --> 01:34:26,770
the other people see, hey this guy
became this. I can do this too.

1658
01:34:26,860 --> 01:34:28,760
And then they do it too.
And then other people say that.

1659
01:34:28,770 --> 01:34:31,450
And you've got a better country.
It's, it's not that hard.

1660
01:34:31,600 --> 01:34:35,890
Instead of being a fucking vampire and
arresting people for crack and pulling

1661
01:34:35,891 --> 01:34:40,891
people over and doing the same goddamn
shit that everybody's been doing for the

1662
01:34:41,020 --> 01:34:41,310
last hundred years,

1663
01:34:41,310 --> 01:34:43,980
it's striking how much
we do things similar.

1664
01:34:44,330 --> 01:34:47,880
One of the things we found when we were
messing around digging through files is

1665
01:34:47,881 --> 01:34:48,580
we found a,

1666
01:34:48,580 --> 01:34:52,910
an action plan a and these action plans
like so a big crime happens and you,

1667
01:34:52,930 --> 01:34:55,620
you're the shift commander were
drop an action plan and send it up.

1668
01:34:55,621 --> 01:34:59,960
What he's going to do to address this and
this action plan was from the 1970s we

1669
01:34:59,961 --> 01:35:02,750
found it in like 2010 whoa.
And you found it.

1670
01:35:02,810 --> 01:35:07,450
We found it in a drawer and it was the
exact same action plan as the other shift

1671
01:35:07,451 --> 01:35:11,270
commander was doing. It was
like the same, the same corners,

1672
01:35:11,330 --> 01:35:16,010
the same response, the same
plan. So like for 40 years,

1673
01:35:16,400 --> 01:35:20,330
nobody's changed anything and you have
the same corners being the same problems

1674
01:35:20,331 --> 01:35:23,630
with the same families and the doing
the same things and the police are doing

1675
01:35:23,631 --> 01:35:27,830
the exact same goddamn thing
in response. Wow. It's,

1676
01:35:27,910 --> 01:35:29,900
it's unbelievable how we're doing this.

1677
01:35:29,901 --> 01:35:33,770
And that's what these talks have to get
us to do is to do exactly what you're

1678
01:35:33,771 --> 01:35:36,590
saying. Communicate, lift up the country.

1679
01:35:36,591 --> 01:35:41,540
It doesn't make any sense that we would
treat a medical problem like it's a

1680
01:35:41,541 --> 01:35:46,420
criminal problem and put those people
into a jail to drug addicts into,

1681
01:35:46,540 --> 01:35:50,070
into a jail cell. It doesn't
make any sense. I'm sorry. What?

1682
01:35:50,100 --> 01:35:53,330
What happens to the cop on the
beat right now in Baltimore?

1683
01:35:53,331 --> 01:35:55,460
What happens to the cops that
are listening to this right now?

1684
01:35:55,640 --> 01:35:56,690
What the fuck can they do?

1685
01:35:56,720 --> 01:36:00,710
These guys have an incredibly hard time
right now because like you're saying

1686
01:36:00,711 --> 01:36:04,070
with bats,
he's not leading the agency properly.

1687
01:36:04,310 --> 01:36:07,030
The FOP is doing some
crazy things as well, uh,

1688
01:36:07,100 --> 01:36:09,740
to calling the uprising lynch mobs,

1689
01:36:09,741 --> 01:36:14,570
going after the wanting to send their
officers down the pike and doing all these

1690
01:36:14,571 --> 01:36:17,180
things when we need justice.
We need something.

1691
01:36:17,240 --> 01:36:21,020
The case needs to be heard in court for
anybody to have any assemblance that

1692
01:36:21,021 --> 01:36:22,640
this is going to be real.

1693
01:36:22,641 --> 01:36:26,900
And this is going to be just because in
the past we know it's all been covered

1694
01:36:26,901 --> 01:36:28,400
up.
So if we continue to cover up,

1695
01:36:28,401 --> 01:36:30,590
which is the problem that happened
in Ferguson is the cover up.

1696
01:36:30,740 --> 01:36:34,520
The problem isn't the shooting problem
is that damn cover up that prosecutors a

1697
01:36:34,521 --> 01:36:38,300
criminal, he criminally covered up that
indictment. There's no way around it.

1698
01:36:38,540 --> 01:36:42,170
That's what they did and no one seemed to
care. So what did he do? Highlight what?

1699
01:36:42,171 --> 01:36:44,480
What happened?
So when you have an indictment,

1700
01:36:44,720 --> 01:36:49,070
the old saying is as you can indict
a ham cheese sandwich because the,

1701
01:36:49,071 --> 01:36:53,300
the prosecutor goes up there and
his job or her job is to select the,

1702
01:36:53,530 --> 01:36:56,540
the evidence that will get the charge.

1703
01:36:57,110 --> 01:36:59,780
So the way that system
actually is is if there's,

1704
01:36:59,781 --> 01:37:01,340
there's four of us in the room right now.

1705
01:37:01,640 --> 01:37:04,580
If three of us think he
did it and one doesn't,

1706
01:37:04,790 --> 01:37:07,880
we don't even listen to the one that
does it. That's how an indictment works.

1707
01:37:08,370 --> 01:37:11,150
If you're not relying to witness,
you don't even come in for the indictment.

1708
01:37:11,630 --> 01:37:14,630
But in that case,
he brought in unreliable witnesses,

1709
01:37:14,840 --> 01:37:19,070
brought in everybody to taint the whole
thing when all he should have brought in

1710
01:37:19,160 --> 01:37:20,900
was the case that,
okay,

1711
01:37:20,901 --> 01:37:25,790
so this guy was shot and he was found
this way and these witnesses say that he

1712
01:37:25,791 --> 01:37:29,450
put his hands up and you would have had
an indictment and you would have had a

1713
01:37:29,451 --> 01:37:33,170
trial and you would've, he would've,
I think that shooting was justified.

1714
01:37:33,470 --> 01:37:38,470
So Darren Wilson would
have been exonerated and
everything would've been fine,

1715
01:37:38,690 --> 01:37:41,960
but we would at least heard the case.
The problem is,

1716
01:37:41,961 --> 01:37:46,940
is that the police walk away with nothing,
so it's like you shoot him,

1717
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:49,670
oh no, we're not going to indict
it. Okay, see you later. Good luck.

1718
01:37:49,671 --> 01:37:52,520
Looks like everything was clear.
Well, we need to see more than that.

1719
01:37:52,760 --> 01:37:57,060
That's why when you see the indictments,
South Carolina, there was no uprising. We,

1720
01:37:57,440 --> 01:38:00,570
we had a shooting in Baltimore just not
too long ago where a guy was robbing a

1721
01:38:00,571 --> 01:38:02,580
seven 11 I think in the
officer came in and shot them.

1722
01:38:02,700 --> 01:38:04,560
There's some speculation that
the guy wasn't even armed,

1723
01:38:04,770 --> 01:38:07,380
but he was robbing a store
so nobody freaks out.

1724
01:38:07,800 --> 01:38:09,630
The problem is is when you
have somebody on our end,

1725
01:38:09,631 --> 01:38:12,990
but no clear crime and it's
just, okay, that's what happened.

1726
01:38:12,991 --> 01:38:16,620
He was afraid what fear is not enough
justification to shoot somebody.

1727
01:38:16,621 --> 01:38:17,700
But that's what the law says.

1728
01:38:17,850 --> 01:38:20,490
The law says that if you're in
fear of your life as an officer,

1729
01:38:20,820 --> 01:38:23,580
you can pull that trigger.
That's preposterous.

1730
01:38:23,910 --> 01:38:28,910
You have to at least be some assemblance
of containing your situation and not

1731
01:38:29,011 --> 01:38:31,170
just being what it is now as
they're afraid at everything.

1732
01:38:31,470 --> 01:38:34,590
So everybody has a gun,
which you know that's an American problem,

1733
01:38:34,830 --> 01:38:38,220
but they feel like everybody is a threat
and you're ingrained into this threat.

1734
01:38:38,221 --> 01:38:42,120
So they run around with fear and they
have your shoot in a heartbeat because

1735
01:38:42,121 --> 01:38:45,270
they're so afraid.
And then the scene,

1736
01:38:45,300 --> 01:38:48,570
they just come behind and they cover it
all up like nothing happened and that's

1737
01:38:48,571 --> 01:38:51,360
when you get an uprising.
It's just when there is no justice.

1738
01:38:51,720 --> 01:38:54,630
That's what Marilyn Mosby
did, you know, like okay. Did.

1739
01:38:54,631 --> 01:38:56,640
Was there uprisings after
she came out and said, okay,

1740
01:38:56,641 --> 01:38:58,110
we're going to charge the officer's?
No,

1741
01:38:58,111 --> 01:39:00,540
because it's not that
everybody's rushing to judgment.

1742
01:39:00,541 --> 01:39:03,570
It's not that it's a lynch mob.
It's let this play out in court.

1743
01:39:03,780 --> 01:39:05,730
I think the two lower
officers are going to get off.

1744
01:39:05,731 --> 01:39:07,950
I don't think that they did
anything particularly wrong.

1745
01:39:07,951 --> 01:39:10,350
They were following their lieutenant.
They might have some things.

1746
01:39:10,350 --> 01:39:13,110
They might not be cops, but they
didn't do anything terribly wrong.

1747
01:39:13,650 --> 01:39:17,190
But you want to hear the case and
you want to know what happened.

1748
01:39:17,220 --> 01:39:18,810
We have to know what happened.

1749
01:39:18,990 --> 01:39:23,850
Just because a guy has a gun and we give
them a badge and he has a GED and he

1750
01:39:23,851 --> 01:39:27,930
went to eight months of training.
Doesn't make him above the world.

1751
01:39:27,931 --> 01:39:31,200
It doesn't make him a
separate set of rules.

1752
01:39:31,950 --> 01:39:35,220
What you think that the
Ferguson shooting was justified?

1753
01:39:36,450 --> 01:39:39,030
I can't go far as to say it's justified.
I think the evidence would say that it,

1754
01:39:39,090 --> 01:39:41,000
it would be rule justified.
I don't know why.

1755
01:39:41,070 --> 01:39:44,760
Because he struck the officer and he is
a close range and it seems like he was

1756
01:39:44,761 --> 01:39:46,300
trying to get his gun. Yeah. If,

1757
01:39:46,440 --> 01:39:49,530
I mean in that situation I think you
get the benefit of doubt to the officer.

1758
01:39:49,920 --> 01:39:53,160
But why were there so many
people that disagreed?

1759
01:39:53,250 --> 01:39:56,310
What was the hands up and all
that stuff? Right. Who knows?

1760
01:39:56,340 --> 01:39:58,530
Did he have his hands
up? Was that, who knows?

1761
01:39:58,531 --> 01:40:02,670
But I think that's enough
justification to find that out. Right.

1762
01:40:02,700 --> 01:40:05,940
And how would they find that out?
At least have the witnesses on Stan.

1763
01:40:06,090 --> 01:40:07,860
But it would just be
questioning witnesses.

1764
01:40:07,861 --> 01:40:11,250
It would just be I witness information.
Sure, sure. But let's hear it. You know,

1765
01:40:11,280 --> 01:40:15,810
maybe he gets out, but it's exonerated
and everything's fine, but let's hear it.

1766
01:40:15,811 --> 01:40:18,180
We need to,
here we have,

1767
01:40:18,300 --> 01:40:23,300
we know that we have a history of
officer's unjustly shooting black males,

1768
01:40:24,540 --> 01:40:25,380
especially on armed.

1769
01:40:25,410 --> 01:40:30,410
We know we have that so that that means
we must have an extra level of scrutiny.

1770
01:40:30,630 --> 01:40:33,930
We have to, and what is the
situation in Cleveland with the kid?

1771
01:40:33,931 --> 01:40:38,190
A 12 year old kid that had the,
that was at the school yard there.

1772
01:40:38,190 --> 01:40:40,530
That guy's being indicted
on murder charges. Right.

1773
01:40:41,040 --> 01:40:44,100
Last I knew he wasn't that
judge suggested that he,

1774
01:40:44,490 --> 01:40:48,360
there was a judge that said there was
enough probable cause to warrant the

1775
01:40:48,361 --> 01:40:51,150
charging, but somebody else
actually has to do that charging.

1776
01:40:51,151 --> 01:40:54,130
I don't believe that's taken place so
that one doesn't make any fucking sense at

1777
01:40:54,131 --> 01:40:57,880
all. Fucking murder is a
murder. It's absolute. There's
no justification for that.

1778
01:40:57,910 --> 01:41:02,440
There's not been a single thing I've
ever watched that that affected me more

1779
01:41:02,590 --> 01:41:07,590
than watching those fucking cops murder
Tamir rice and then stand over that boy,

1780
01:41:07,750 --> 01:41:12,160
a 12 year old boy as he was bleeding out
and choking, they stood there and they,

1781
01:41:12,520 --> 01:41:16,330
he's worried conjecture, but it
looks like he's worried. Oh my God,

1782
01:41:16,360 --> 01:41:17,290
I'm in this situation.

1783
01:41:17,380 --> 01:41:22,360
What am I going to do as a 12 year old
boy fucking chokes on his own blood dying

1784
01:41:22,361 --> 01:41:23,230
and he stands there,

1785
01:41:23,350 --> 01:41:26,830
stands there doing nothing until someone
else comes over and finally helps that

1786
01:41:26,831 --> 01:41:29,290
boy and he's not being indicted.
Are we kidding me?

1787
01:41:29,320 --> 01:41:32,510
That's fucking murder and
shot him within two seconds.

1788
01:41:32,520 --> 01:41:36,370
It was lesson 1.6 seconds.
They rush up on that kid.

1789
01:41:36,400 --> 01:41:38,770
There's no justification for any of them.

1790
01:41:38,950 --> 01:41:42,550
What's happening in Cleveland is absurd.
There's no doubt about,

1791
01:41:43,180 --> 01:41:45,820
is Cleveland like Baltimore
at the same sort of cycle?

1792
01:41:46,180 --> 01:41:50,920
I have no reason to believe that
Cleveland, Baltimore, Ferguson, Atlanta,

1793
01:41:50,921 --> 01:41:53,260
any of those places are different.
I think we can take an officer.

1794
01:41:53,290 --> 01:41:56,230
There's some just happened in Philly
just now before I walked in here.

1795
01:41:56,620 --> 01:42:01,420
A video was released of Philly officer's
a 12 Philly officers beating on

1796
01:42:01,421 --> 01:42:04,780
somebody that was on armed for apparently
riding a bike or something like that.

1797
01:42:04,781 --> 01:42:06,580
I have no,
I didn't get a chance to see.

1798
01:42:06,880 --> 01:42:09,040
But all of these things
seem to be the same.

1799
01:42:09,070 --> 01:42:12,490
So if you took an officer out of Philly,
you can put them in Baltimore. He's fine.

1800
01:42:12,550 --> 01:42:15,250
When we had Hurricane
Katrina, we took, uh,

1801
01:42:15,630 --> 01:42:20,630
maybe 20 officers from New Orleans and
brought them into the BPD and they,

1802
01:42:21,550 --> 01:42:24,520
there's not like, they like, oh my God,
what are we doing? It was the same.

1803
01:42:24,550 --> 01:42:27,970
Same thing. Same Shit, same shit.
Different report. That's all.

1804
01:42:28,090 --> 01:42:29,600
So it's just ghettos.

1805
01:42:32,740 --> 01:42:36,640
Ghettos. Yes. A black guy goes to a
separate, a separate level. Black ghettos,

1806
01:42:37,360 --> 01:42:42,250
mostly black, low income period. It's
the power list, the voiceless period.

1807
01:42:42,490 --> 01:42:45,670
But I think that institutional racism
that we have throughout our society,

1808
01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:48,760
it wasn't that long ago that we're having
slaves and were still arguing over the

1809
01:42:48,761 --> 01:42:49,594
confederate flag.

1810
01:42:50,830 --> 01:42:53,530
I know you said something about they're
arguing about the dukes of Hazzard.

1811
01:42:53,860 --> 01:42:57,490
I think you confused sir.
Yeah, they're fucking,

1812
01:42:57,580 --> 01:43:02,580
how about the fact that it flies over
state house until 2015 it's God damn

1813
01:43:02,651 --> 01:43:03,540
crazy.
Yeah.

1814
01:43:03,541 --> 01:43:08,110
The fact that this is the first year that
someone stepped up and stop that from

1815
01:43:08,111 --> 01:43:10,240
happening and then
people are freaking out.

1816
01:43:10,330 --> 01:43:14,560
It's about heritage southern narrative.
Imagine,

1817
01:43:14,920 --> 01:43:18,940
imagine a Nazi flag Nazi flag
flying up. I mean, oh, come on.

1818
01:43:18,941 --> 01:43:21,010
What did you say though about that
flag? Come on. I saw you say something.

1819
01:43:21,011 --> 01:43:24,760
What was it? Oh, I said about daisy
Duke. I said the real flag was the,

1820
01:43:24,761 --> 01:43:28,210
the daisy dukes. The shorts, because
that was a flag of empowerment.

1821
01:43:28,850 --> 01:43:31,510
There's it never been.
It was an article of clothing.

1822
01:43:31,780 --> 01:43:35,670
Well for females and for gay
men, sluts and gay men. That's,

1823
01:43:35,750 --> 01:43:38,020
there was never an article
of clothing that's,

1824
01:43:38,050 --> 01:43:40,950
that just clearly outlined
that you're hungry for Dick.

1825
01:43:41,800 --> 01:43:45,970
There was one that we've ever created
and that's the daisy Duke shorts.

1826
01:43:46,210 --> 01:43:48,520
Nobody wears daisy Duke
shorts if you don't want Dick,

1827
01:43:49,180 --> 01:43:52,490
if you're a dude and you were in daisy
Duke shorts hunting for Dick and if your

1828
01:43:52,491 --> 01:43:54,140
girl,
we're in daisy Duke shorts,

1829
01:43:54,230 --> 01:43:58,070
you're hunting for deck and there
was never like a flag. They like,

1830
01:43:58,071 --> 01:43:59,580
they threw up a flag that let up,

1831
01:43:59,600 --> 01:44:02,930
let people know they want some deck and
I have an objection. It's true, right?

1832
01:44:03,290 --> 01:44:06,350
It's true. That's the, that's
the real fucking travesty.

1833
01:44:06,530 --> 01:44:10,580
What they should do is go
over that fucking show, put
the show back on the air.

1834
01:44:10,581 --> 01:44:12,920
God dammit,
go over that show at some CGI.

1835
01:44:12,921 --> 01:44:16,550
Put a Goddamn American flag on the roof
and let's be done with it. How long,

1836
01:44:16,590 --> 01:44:17,600
how much would that cost?

1837
01:44:17,630 --> 01:44:20,950
They could do that shit if they could
make the Hawk and the Avengers bounced

1838
01:44:20,951 --> 01:44:23,650
through buildings and
shit. You told me. Yeah.

1839
01:44:23,660 --> 01:44:26,870
You can't fucking fake a flag
on the roof of up. First of all,

1840
01:44:27,050 --> 01:44:32,030
the real crime is to paint that fucking
beautiful car, that shitty color.

1841
01:44:32,600 --> 01:44:36,110
You took us 69 charger or a 68 charger,

1842
01:44:36,111 --> 01:44:39,980
whichever one wants to think is this nine
one of the most beautiful muscle cars

1843
01:44:39,981 --> 01:44:43,850
ever created. And you painted it
like you goddamn Spanish hooker.

1844
01:44:44,640 --> 01:44:48,050
The bullshit. That's the real
bullshit. Paint that fucking thing.

1845
01:44:48,051 --> 01:44:52,700
Orange was stupid flag of a bunch of
losers. That's a loser flag by the way.

1846
01:44:53,270 --> 01:44:57,940
Yeah, you heard me folks,
y'all lost treasonous assholes.

1847
01:44:58,090 --> 01:45:00,220
It's like raising a flag or
another country anyway, did well,

1848
01:45:00,230 --> 01:45:01,150
it's like raising a foe.

1849
01:45:01,180 --> 01:45:04,670
They wanted to win and they
didn't win was about economics.

1850
01:45:05,300 --> 01:45:09,860
It's about economics. Yeah. If you
don't pay people, you make more money.

1851
01:45:10,310 --> 01:45:12,080
So that's an economic choice.

1852
01:45:15,870 --> 01:45:16,430
You know,

1853
01:45:16,430 --> 01:45:20,990
the south represents and
that flag represented a lot
of things to people other

1854
01:45:20,991 --> 01:45:23,630
than racism.
What they need is a new flag.

1855
01:45:23,810 --> 01:45:27,890
You need a new flag that represents the
south alone and not a bunch of people

1856
01:45:27,891 --> 01:45:32,590
that were fighting to keep racism.
You know, Dan Carlin said that, um,

1857
01:45:32,690 --> 01:45:33,920
they should add to the flag,

1858
01:45:34,250 --> 01:45:38,990
like maybe keep that flag and put a
broken chain on it that represents the,

1859
01:45:38,991 --> 01:45:43,400
the abolishment of slavery that like,
it keeps southern heritage within an ads.

1860
01:45:43,401 --> 01:45:45,290
One thing to it, I mean,
that might be a thing,

1861
01:45:45,470 --> 01:45:48,920
but they could come up with
another fucking flag. It's
a flag. It's just a symbol.

1862
01:45:49,160 --> 01:45:52,760
If you want a symbol of the South
Texas has a fucking beautiful flag.

1863
01:45:53,090 --> 01:45:57,680
Texas has a flag and the star of Texas
and nobody ever thinks of it representing

1864
01:45:57,681 --> 01:46:01,880
racism or represent, it's just
fucking Texas. The Star of Texas.

1865
01:46:01,881 --> 01:46:03,980
It's just the star of Texas that's legit.

1866
01:46:04,220 --> 01:46:07,700
Like if you were a Texas flag t
shirt on, everybody knows. Wow.

1867
01:46:07,701 --> 01:46:10,070
That's the guy who was a fan of Texas.
You know what I'm saying?

1868
01:46:10,071 --> 01:46:13,790
It doesn't have any connotation that you
hate black people or you want racism or

1869
01:46:13,791 --> 01:46:16,850
you want slavery. That's
a, that's a legit flag.

1870
01:46:17,030 --> 01:46:20,570
They need to come up with a goddamn
better flag up for world with no flags.

1871
01:46:20,870 --> 01:46:25,270
A world with no flags. Mm hmm. Okay.
What about the don't tread on me.

1872
01:46:25,271 --> 01:46:30,150
That's pretty slick. I like that
one snake. Oh No, no. Nobody say,

1873
01:46:30,230 --> 01:46:34,220
I mean everybody has had it. Don't try
it on the side, but you really have,

1874
01:46:34,221 --> 01:46:36,230
are they scared of those people?
How about an eagle?

1875
01:46:37,200 --> 01:46:40,940
Probably either the fucking talent,
fuller rockets,

1876
01:46:41,410 --> 01:46:44,630
rockets and one and then
the other one a dick.

1877
01:46:45,710 --> 01:46:50,670
He's got a dick in one hand.
Represent everybody just talking shit.

1878
01:46:50,910 --> 01:46:54,990
I just think that uh, yeah, the
world, a world without flags,

1879
01:46:54,991 --> 01:46:59,970
like ideally no ideology,
you know, ideally no, uh,

1880
01:47:00,030 --> 01:47:03,120
no borders.
Ideally no nationalism,

1881
01:47:03,480 --> 01:47:07,050
no state pride and just be proud that
you're a human being and human race.

1882
01:47:07,051 --> 01:47:10,050
But there's some cool shit
about having differences.

1883
01:47:10,320 --> 01:47:13,260
There's some cool shit that you can go
to New Mexico and it's different than

1884
01:47:13,261 --> 01:47:16,020
going to Michigan. I liked
that. I liked variation.

1885
01:47:16,290 --> 01:47:19,140
I like people that are happy
that they live in Los Angeles.

1886
01:47:19,141 --> 01:47:21,240
They have pride
straightening your nice here.

1887
01:47:21,700 --> 01:47:24,700
Yeah, I like it. I never been to the
west coast. We were just driving around.

1888
01:47:24,701 --> 01:47:28,690
We went up the Pacific coast today,
coastal highway today, and uh, the canyon,

1889
01:47:28,691 --> 01:47:29,890
I can't remember his,
call it Malibu Canyon.

1890
01:47:30,600 --> 01:47:34,250
Beautiful one of my bikes so bad I was
hurting. It's like, where can I rent them?

1891
01:47:34,280 --> 01:47:37,600
Motorcycle. Malibu Canyon road is
amazing and it was unbelievable what?

1892
01:47:37,601 --> 01:47:40,720
We've never seen anything like that.
But in the northeast we have water.

1893
01:47:41,650 --> 01:47:43,660
Oh yeah, yeah. We'll
still water from Seattle.

1894
01:47:43,661 --> 01:47:47,440
They ain't gonna do shit about it
either. Stop, take that water, son.

1895
01:47:47,470 --> 01:47:49,210
Give me that shit.
This is what I think.

1896
01:47:49,240 --> 01:47:52,530
If they could bring fucking oil down
from Alaska, why can't they bring water?

1897
01:47:52,830 --> 01:47:57,490
They can hook a big tube up to one of
those melting glaciers and you steal all

1898
01:47:57,491 --> 01:47:59,620
that fucking water and we're good.

1899
01:47:59,800 --> 01:48:02,750
And then we irrigate the shit out of
this bitch and turn into a tropical rain

1900
01:48:02,751 --> 01:48:06,850
forest. Just giant sprinklers
that are in the sky. You know,

1901
01:48:06,851 --> 01:48:11,740
giant ones like 30,000 feet up,
just spraying shit. Come on,

1902
01:48:11,741 --> 01:48:16,630
man. You can make a hyperloop. They can
get to San Francisco in five seconds.

1903
01:48:16,631 --> 01:48:20,290
Like what Elon Musk is trying to do. You
can't put a sprinkler system in the sky.

1904
01:48:20,440 --> 01:48:23,890
I think you can't steal water out of the
icebergs that everybody's worried about.

1905
01:48:23,920 --> 01:48:28,030
Global warming with the iceberg smelt.
The Malibu is going to disappear.

1906
01:48:28,240 --> 01:48:30,740
Fuck it is.
We're going to put a big goddamn too

1907
01:48:32,320 --> 01:48:37,180
and suck all those icebergs.
It's sprayed all over the avocado fields.

1908
01:48:37,270 --> 01:48:40,960
That sounds crazy to watch up either
solution. It is a solution. It's why not.

1909
01:48:40,961 --> 01:48:45,490
If you can get oil from Saudi Arabia
by millions and millions of gallons and

1910
01:48:45,491 --> 01:48:49,480
tankers and bring it across
the god Damn Ocean to America,

1911
01:48:49,630 --> 01:48:53,830
you're telling me you can't take water
from somewhere and bring it down here.

1912
01:48:53,831 --> 01:48:56,050
That's stupid.
Of course they can.

1913
01:48:56,650 --> 01:49:01,090
The problem is can they get enough water?
Cause we use a lot of fucking water.

1914
01:49:01,240 --> 01:49:02,290
There's a lot of golf courses here.

1915
01:49:02,291 --> 01:49:04,960
People like to call off a lot of
white people and there's almonds.

1916
01:49:05,020 --> 01:49:08,020
Almonds apparently suck up a lot of
water and a lot of people have pools.

1917
01:49:08,140 --> 01:49:11,020
There's a lot of issues,
but I think they can be engineered.

1918
01:49:11,200 --> 01:49:13,800
You know the real issue is,
you know,

1919
01:49:14,110 --> 01:49:16,390
there's a lot of global warming talk,

1920
01:49:16,930 --> 01:49:19,990
but I think Pete places have
always turned, you know,

1921
01:49:19,991 --> 01:49:21,790
there's always been like air.
I mean,

1922
01:49:22,090 --> 01:49:25,090
all you have to do is just look back
to the ice age and you realize, well,

1923
01:49:25,091 --> 01:49:27,850
there's not an ice age anymore, so
something happened. There's some change.

1924
01:49:27,890 --> 01:49:31,810
Well that's this. We don't live in this
static place, but we're so arrogant.

1925
01:49:31,990 --> 01:49:35,620
We figured out, we feel like if we
build a city, we could stay. You know,

1926
01:49:35,621 --> 01:49:38,140
this is it. We're here now.
But if this becomes a Sahara,

1927
01:49:38,470 --> 01:49:40,600
you know there's a go to this
hair does it? What do you find?

1928
01:49:40,630 --> 01:49:43,600
You don't find a lot of fucking people.
There's a reason. There's nothing there.

1929
01:49:43,660 --> 01:49:45,940
You can't live off of it. What do
you, what are you going to eat, man?

1930
01:49:45,941 --> 01:49:49,210
You can eat your camel if you don't eat
your camera. There's not a lot to eat,

1931
01:49:49,420 --> 01:49:51,970
you know? And that's just the
reality of being a human being.

1932
01:49:52,210 --> 01:49:53,500
If we live on this earth,

1933
01:49:53,920 --> 01:49:58,330
we occasionally you have to move
because the spots socks. Now, you know,

1934
01:49:58,390 --> 01:50:02,350
this spot is fantastic.
You're this, you're here for
the first time. But listen,

1935
01:50:02,710 --> 01:50:06,070
there's a reason why there's 30 million
fucking people stuffed into this area.

1936
01:50:06,100 --> 01:50:10,420
It's because it's a sweet spot.
But all it take is one of those,

1937
01:50:11,060 --> 01:50:15,370
the, the rock style earthquakes
from that new fucking movie.

1938
01:50:15,400 --> 01:50:17,560
One real one,
which has happened before.

1939
01:50:17,920 --> 01:50:21,760
They've had some giant ones in spots
all over the world that we know of.

1940
01:50:21,790 --> 01:50:22,031
You know,

1941
01:50:22,031 --> 01:50:27,031
that human beings don't have record of
that had just been just unbelievably

1942
01:50:27,311 --> 01:50:29,860
devastating.
All we'd need is one of those just one.

1943
01:50:30,400 --> 01:50:33,920
And everybody would scatter like ants.
And then you go to boulder, Colorado,

1944
01:50:33,970 --> 01:50:35,950
be over one with chicks from Santa Monica.

1945
01:50:38,470 --> 01:50:41,320
It'd be dudes on Adderall
with fucking botox faces

1946
01:50:42,880 --> 01:50:47,020
driving the Tesla's around boulder. Hey,
that's, it's become, it's a nice car.

1947
01:50:47,200 --> 01:50:52,000
It's fast too. It's a good car.
Beautiful. Um, but you guys,

1948
01:50:52,030 --> 01:50:55,960
it's too cold in Baltimore. That's
bullshit. Yeah. We had a bad winter.

1949
01:50:56,680 --> 01:51:01,360
It's nothing. I grew up in Boston, which
is worse, way worse through though.

1950
01:51:01,810 --> 01:51:05,710
Uh, how that city, uh, it's all right.

1951
01:51:06,490 --> 01:51:10,180
It's okay. You can fucking have it
for five months. A year and a yes,

1952
01:51:10,181 --> 01:51:11,110
that's right when summer time.

1953
01:51:11,111 --> 01:51:14,860
So I'm still talking about my house at
a bit summertime in Boston's amazing.

1954
01:51:15,160 --> 01:51:17,380
It's like I'm, I'm going to Chicago, uh,

1955
01:51:17,390 --> 01:51:21,250
at the end of the month and I'm fucking
site because Chicago in the summer is

1956
01:51:21,251 --> 01:51:22,150
amazing.
You know why?

1957
01:51:22,360 --> 01:51:24,970
Because those people appreciate
the fact that it's the summer,

1958
01:51:25,210 --> 01:51:29,680
summer in la every day.
It could be 90 in January here.

1959
01:51:30,160 --> 01:51:33,260
I mean it's happened many times,
right? Jamie? You experienced 90? Yeah.

1960
01:51:33,790 --> 01:51:37,810
Walking around in shorts. Flip
flops. Tee Shirt. Nineties beautiful.

1961
01:51:37,840 --> 01:51:42,540
January convertible 75
[inaudible] 75. It's nice. I know.

1962
01:51:42,541 --> 01:51:45,160
It's a nice day to day.
It was 60 this morning when I woke up.

1963
01:51:45,190 --> 01:51:49,750
I had to get up early. It was 66 zero. Mm.

1964
01:51:50,220 --> 01:51:53,980
Yeah. That doesn't happen for us. No,
right now it's brutally hot. Yeah.

1965
01:51:53,981 --> 01:51:56,870
Well you guys get that
swampy hot. Too Nasty. Yeah.

1966
01:51:57,090 --> 01:52:00,190
That east coast hot is a
different kind of hot like Miami.

1967
01:52:00,460 --> 01:52:03,700
You don't even know what hot is until
you experienced Miami and August.

1968
01:52:03,740 --> 01:52:07,860
It might as well be in Africa. Even
the God damn jungle. You know, I,

1969
01:52:07,870 --> 01:52:11,620
we hear a funny car chase story. I want
to hear all your funny car chase stories.

1970
01:52:11,770 --> 01:52:15,400
Okay. How many got three? Okay.

1971
01:52:16,180 --> 01:52:19,900
So my first car chase,
this is,

1972
01:52:20,080 --> 01:52:24,760
this is how far after the guy having
some other dude's pants on, uh,

1973
01:52:25,090 --> 01:52:29,050
about a year. A year. So a
year. And so I have a partner.

1974
01:52:29,890 --> 01:52:33,040
You usually don't have partners
in Baltimore at a partner
on this particular day?

1975
01:52:33,270 --> 01:52:37,610
Yeah. You ride by yourself. What,
what does that to save money? Uh,

1976
01:52:37,670 --> 01:52:41,680
I think more of an omnipresence idea.
Oh, the more people that are more cops,

1977
01:52:41,681 --> 01:52:45,740
more cause it doesn't really work, I
think every jerk off in your car. No, no

1978
01:52:46,980 --> 01:52:50,720
one told me that. Real quick, just
to ask you. I would, I get bored.

1979
01:52:52,700 --> 01:52:57,040
So I have this partner, he looks like
Sammy Davis Jr. Oh Jesus. Great Guy.

1980
01:52:57,230 --> 01:53:00,380
Great Guy. We'd go to calls. Did
you call him Sammy Davis Jr? I mean,

1981
01:53:00,381 --> 01:53:05,240
maybe sometimes joking and he was dead.
He looked that bad.

1982
01:53:05,241 --> 01:53:07,150
You're kind of a Sinatra
when he was younger. Oh.

1983
01:53:07,170 --> 01:53:09,560
Can you see Sinatra when you're buying?
Nobody else thought of that.

1984
01:53:09,590 --> 01:53:13,820
Now hold on a second.
Pull up the Sinatra's Sinatra's mugshot.

1985
01:53:15,620 --> 01:53:19,140
He was a tiny dude. You know, snapchat
only weighed like 125 pounds. No, no, no,

1986
01:53:19,160 --> 01:53:22,280
not you. You're, you're handsome. Like
Sinatra muscular and big. I get it.

1987
01:53:22,281 --> 01:53:23,180
But being not tiny,

1988
01:53:23,320 --> 01:53:27,070
your, your average guy, but I'm
saying Sinatra was like 130 pounds.

1989
01:53:27,071 --> 01:53:30,040
He was like a tiny dude.
Look at that. Come on dude.

1990
01:53:30,940 --> 01:53:35,560
You're a little better looking than him.
I'll be honest. What is, where's his a,

1991
01:53:35,561 --> 01:53:38,740
what do they arrested him for it? Because
it was like a little card that had the,

1992
01:53:38,741 --> 01:53:41,620
uh, there's a thing below it. There was a,

1993
01:53:41,680 --> 01:53:46,450
I used to have it on my wall at
home actually. It's not that one,

1994
01:53:47,380 --> 01:53:47,861
but uh,

1995
01:53:47,861 --> 01:53:51,400
he was arrested and it had its site
and wait for carrying on with a married

1996
01:53:51,401 --> 01:53:54,910
woman. Yeah, yeah. It was
called seduction. That's
what he got arrested for.

1997
01:53:55,060 --> 01:53:55,893
But that's not the,

1998
01:53:55,990 --> 01:54:00,070
there was actual real piece of paper
from the arrest that you can, uh,

1999
01:54:00,100 --> 01:54:04,810
you could see they had it like handwritten
and everything when he was arrested

2000
01:54:04,811 --> 01:54:08,500
for, see if we could find
it. But it had his, uh,

2001
01:54:08,560 --> 01:54:13,560
his height and weight and I'm pretty sure
he's 130 pounds and he was like five,

2002
01:54:13,991 --> 01:54:18,040
six or five, seven. He's like a tiny
little dude, which I never would thought.

2003
01:54:18,041 --> 01:54:22,750
I thought, you know, Frank Sinatra would
be like, it's just larger than life,

2004
01:54:22,751 --> 01:54:25,810
you know? I mean like Tom
Cruise kind of thing. No,

2005
01:54:25,811 --> 01:54:30,100
I think Tom Cruise is probably not as
short as everybody says. Right? Yeah.

2006
01:54:30,140 --> 01:54:34,500
I mean he might be a little
shorter, like five, seven may be,

2007
01:54:34,510 --> 01:54:35,980
but everybody said he's like five too.

2008
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:41,490
People are just mean. Creem my partner,
he was about five, two, five, three. Oh,

2009
01:54:41,540 --> 01:54:46,110
Sammy Davis Jr Jesus Christ. And he would
cop, what does he punish me as? Good.

2010
01:54:46,350 --> 01:54:49,770
Yeah. So good. Cause he planted then
like nobody noticed him. Oh right.

2011
01:54:49,910 --> 01:54:53,080
And when he wa yeah, no one's
scared of five to Buckeye. Right.

2012
01:54:53,460 --> 01:54:56,630
We would go to places and he would be
the nicest cop. I mean, he was like,

2013
01:54:56,980 --> 01:55:01,080
like what you think the top is? That
was him. He was so nice, so courteous,

2014
01:55:01,440 --> 01:55:04,470
and I'd show up behind me like
sit down and shut the fuck up. Oh,

2015
01:55:04,500 --> 01:55:08,430
you're a bad cop. He would
get the complaint. I wouldn't.
Unbelievably hilarious.

2016
01:55:08,460 --> 01:55:12,370
I don't know why. It was just a
running joke with us cause he bought,

2017
01:55:13,060 --> 01:55:14,760
I can't throw that conjecture out there,

2018
01:55:14,761 --> 01:55:17,700
but most likely I would have
thought of that I thought was just,

2019
01:55:17,701 --> 01:55:19,860
they didn't like it or they liked me.
I don't know.

2020
01:55:19,861 --> 01:55:21,330
I never thought of it
as being a racial thing.

2021
01:55:21,960 --> 01:55:26,880
So we're going down a road and we
type a tag in a car and it comes up,

2022
01:55:26,881 --> 01:55:30,780
boop, boop, boop. The stolen
car. Oh Shit Dude, it's fucking
dog. Are we going to do,

2023
01:55:31,530 --> 01:55:35,220
why would it be whispering? I don't know.
But you start to panic. And I was like,

2024
01:55:35,221 --> 01:55:36,031
all right,
fuck it.

2025
01:55:36,031 --> 01:55:38,940
Let's just get out and I'll just yank
him out of the car real quick because

2026
01:55:38,941 --> 01:55:43,080
we're stuck in traffic. Right? So go
out. As soon as I jumped out of the car,

2027
01:55:43,320 --> 01:55:44,070
looks over at

2028
01:55:44,070 --> 01:55:48,810
me, the driver of the car, and
he slams down his, his lock
door lock. I'm like, fuck.

2029
01:55:48,811 --> 01:55:51,750
So I tried to rip the door open and
I can't do it. So for some reason,

2030
01:55:51,751 --> 01:55:55,680
instinctually I pull out my guide and I'm
like, get out of the car. And he's like,

2031
01:55:55,681 --> 01:55:58,380
no, fuck you. And it starts to turn
green and these get ready to go.

2032
01:55:58,620 --> 01:56:01,650
So I take my gun and I
hit it against the window.

2033
01:56:01,950 --> 01:56:06,450
The window doesn't break my gun.
Does the rounds go flying on the ground,

2034
01:56:06,451 --> 01:56:10,770
scattering out? And this is like noon.
And so everybody sees me doing this.

2035
01:56:10,771 --> 01:56:14,910
Like a jackass,
a glock 20 plastic plastic gun.

2036
01:56:15,020 --> 01:56:17,980
Why don't you hit her fucking window?
Fucking thinking.

2037
01:56:19,990 --> 01:56:24,300
So instinctually,
luckily I reload right and he takes off.

2038
01:56:24,960 --> 01:56:28,330
We run back into the car and we're
not going anywhere. I'm like, cream?

2039
01:56:28,340 --> 01:56:32,630
What the fuck? Let's go. And he's like, I
can't find the keys. I can't find a king.

2040
01:56:32,670 --> 01:56:36,900
Know. So he gets the key. We
take off, we go down the road.

2041
01:56:36,960 --> 01:56:39,930
What kind of car do you drive? It was
a, it was a crown Vic at the time. Okay.

2042
01:56:40,010 --> 01:56:44,370
Shitbox we cops love graphics.
Yeah, but there's 58 in them. Dude.

2043
01:56:44,760 --> 01:56:48,900
Big fucking goofy car, Shitty, shitty.
His front wheel drive Taurus's and shit.

2044
01:56:48,901 --> 01:56:53,850
They tried to give us fuck no drop. We
go down the road, the guy makes a turn,

2045
01:56:54,330 --> 01:56:55,260
we lose him.

2046
01:56:55,350 --> 01:56:59,820
But we kind of know his area where
he is and I see a guy that's running,

2047
01:56:59,821 --> 01:57:03,630
he had a blue Bandana on, he
was black guy, white t shirt.

2048
01:57:03,690 --> 01:57:07,830
So I see a guy going down the alley, blue
Bandana, white t shirt like fuck cream,

2049
01:57:07,831 --> 01:57:10,530
get out. So he gets out and he's
coming from the guy who behind.

2050
01:57:10,531 --> 01:57:14,400
I circle around with the car and
come up and I come around the corner.

2051
01:57:14,401 --> 01:57:16,860
That guy's looking at me and I'm like,
get on the ground.

2052
01:57:17,760 --> 01:57:20,070
And he starts getting on the ground
and I'm looking at him, I'm like, fuck,

2053
01:57:20,370 --> 01:57:21,960
this is,
this is not the same guy.

2054
01:57:22,820 --> 01:57:26,270
So I'm watching and creams coming up
behind him and he's like, come in hard.

2055
01:57:26,271 --> 01:57:28,500
I'm like, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2056
01:57:28,610 --> 01:57:31,230
Just as he's getting ready to hit him
and he pulls back and just get ready to

2057
01:57:31,231 --> 01:57:35,250
slam it to the ground, like this
is not him. So we leave him go,

2058
01:57:35,490 --> 01:57:38,010
we run it and we,
we actually find the car.

2059
01:57:38,010 --> 01:57:41,220
So the guy bowed out and he'd
left his cell phone in the car.

2060
01:57:41,790 --> 01:57:44,970
So we picked up the cell phone and we
called the most recent number and a girl

2061
01:57:44,971 --> 01:57:48,240
answered and we were like,
Hey, oh, I'm so and so.

2062
01:57:48,241 --> 01:57:51,360
I found this phone on the side of the
road. Do you know what belongs to,

2063
01:57:51,361 --> 01:57:53,160
I tried to get it back to
[inaudible] and she's like, oh yeah,

2064
01:57:53,161 --> 01:57:57,180
that's so and so for him up in the, in the
computer. And that was who had the car.

2065
01:57:57,181 --> 01:58:01,590
So he, oh my God, I'd be
so mad at her. I be like,

2066
01:58:01,591 --> 01:58:05,490
what the fuck did you tell him? Oh
my God, you told my fucking name.

2067
01:58:05,491 --> 01:58:09,750
All my God in the report and everything.
Oh that's hilarious. Did you get the Guy?

2068
01:58:10,020 --> 01:58:12,690
If somebody else did, so we
had the warrant. Somebody
else ended up catching him.

2069
01:58:13,200 --> 01:58:15,840
That's hilarious. That was your
first car check? First car chase.

2070
01:58:15,870 --> 01:58:19,200
Why don't they give you guys like
mustangs or something fast? Ooh,

2071
01:58:19,260 --> 01:58:23,820
I think that'd be a bad idea. Why not?
Very responsible. Is that what it is?

2072
01:58:24,210 --> 01:58:28,800
The law. We're not trained to drive
like that. Uh, the law, wait a minute,

2073
01:58:28,801 --> 01:58:33,210
hold the fuck on. They don't train you
how to drive. Not Highspeed. No, no.

2074
01:58:33,450 --> 01:58:35,760
They let you drive high speed chases.

2075
01:58:35,770 --> 01:58:39,540
They know you're breaking the rules
to do a high speed chase in Baltimore,

2076
01:58:39,750 --> 01:58:42,040
you can't do more than 10 miles
an hour was in Maryland. You

2077
01:58:42,040 --> 01:58:44,890
can't do 10 more than 10 miles an hour
over the speed limit according to the

2078
01:58:45,140 --> 01:58:47,170
rules.
So the law says you can do it,

2079
01:58:47,171 --> 01:58:50,560
but the rules of the agency say you
can only do 10 miles an hour over.

2080
01:58:50,590 --> 01:58:54,100
So every cop that pulls you over and
you're doing more than 10 miles per hour

2081
01:58:54,101 --> 01:58:54,671
over the speed limit,

2082
01:58:54,671 --> 01:58:59,070
he had the violate general orders
even pull you over was the rules.

2083
01:58:59,080 --> 01:59:04,060
I didn't make them. Okay. So the
department lets you do high speed chases.

2084
01:59:04,560 --> 01:59:08,390
They don't like it. No. But
so who lets you do it some,

2085
01:59:08,410 --> 01:59:12,580
you said you do it so somebody
tells you no. Okay. But they don't,

2086
01:59:12,700 --> 01:59:16,870
no one teaches you how to drive.
We go to a course and they kind of do it,

2087
01:59:16,871 --> 01:59:19,990
but the standards are incredibly
low and you don't go very fast.

2088
01:59:19,991 --> 01:59:22,030
So the standards for driving,

2089
01:59:22,031 --> 01:59:25,870
are they more or less stringent
than the standards for self defense?

2090
01:59:26,620 --> 01:59:30,720
I don't think there's a
standard in either. Um,

2091
01:59:30,820 --> 01:59:33,940
so that is so fucking
crazy. Right? If you,

2092
01:59:33,941 --> 01:59:36,490
if you couldn't defend yourself going in,

2093
01:59:36,640 --> 01:59:38,290
you're not going to have to
defend yourself coming out.

2094
01:59:38,291 --> 01:59:40,300
If you couldn't drive going in,
you're not going to drive coming out.

2095
01:59:40,301 --> 01:59:41,134
If you couldn't shoot going in,

2096
01:59:41,150 --> 01:59:44,920
you're not going to shoot coming out when
the scariest things is is cops ability

2097
01:59:44,921 --> 01:59:47,860
to fire a weapon. They're
terrible. They're terrible.

2098
01:59:48,400 --> 01:59:53,280
So I would estimate that may have
to be accurate or anything. No,

2099
01:59:53,290 --> 01:59:56,710
no, it's, it's, it's absurd.
Like they can't shoot.

2100
01:59:56,711 --> 01:59:57,850
So like when you hear somebody like,

2101
01:59:57,851 --> 02:00:00,850
why didn't you shoot him in the knee
for one, you, you can't do that. That's,

2102
02:00:00,851 --> 02:00:03,700
that's a silly idea.
But why can't you? Okay.

2103
02:00:03,701 --> 02:00:05,510
So if I'm shooting for
what I'm shooting at Uni,

2104
02:00:05,590 --> 02:00:09,870
I'm shooting down so I'm liable to
ricochet. I cause I'm gonna miss it.

2105
02:00:09,910 --> 02:00:12,940
You're going to be a moving target. You
know how hard it is to shoot an animal.

2106
02:00:12,941 --> 02:00:16,360
So imagine shooting a human in such a
tiny area that's trying to shoot with a

2107
02:00:16,361 --> 02:00:18,490
handgun. Right? You can't do
it. It's, it's a silly idea.

2108
02:00:18,491 --> 02:00:21,820
That's why you shoot sooner.
Center mass people criticize that,

2109
02:00:21,821 --> 02:00:23,890
but it's really the only
practical way to do it.

2110
02:00:25,240 --> 02:00:29,290
But she used to shoot animals to get,
very rarely shoot it out.

2111
02:00:29,720 --> 02:00:32,310
Imagine that even if he was standing
there and as we tried to take out a knee

2112
02:00:32,311 --> 02:00:36,150
cap of a boar sitting there,
that's, that's ridiculous. So,

2113
02:00:36,190 --> 02:00:40,460
so hopefully one day we can all dispel
that rumor about shooting a weapon at

2114
02:00:40,900 --> 02:00:42,670
somebody. I'd be like, why didn't you
shoot the knife out of his hand? Like,

2115
02:00:42,671 --> 02:00:47,020
are you kidding me? That's
hilarious. But they don't shoot,

2116
02:00:47,230 --> 02:00:52,200
they couldn't shoot a person,
let alone a neat, right. Like we,

2117
02:00:52,300 --> 02:00:56,470
the standard, a minimum score is like
a 70 and it's a silhouette target.

2118
02:00:57,420 --> 02:01:02,420
Like I minimum score meaning 70%
70% or when a silhouette you're,

2119
02:01:02,910 --> 02:01:04,060
no.
Okay.

2120
02:01:04,061 --> 02:01:07,930
So you go to hit the wholesale away from
the three to the five to the seventh to

2121
02:01:07,931 --> 02:01:11,740
the 15th I can shoot that whole course of
the 15 with my eyes closed and pass it.

2122
02:01:11,920 --> 02:01:13,830
Right. 15 yards. Is it?

2123
02:01:13,831 --> 02:01:17,140
That is so 15 yards with a handgun
hitting center mass on a tar.

2124
02:01:17,141 --> 02:01:18,260
All you have to do is just hit the target.

2125
02:01:18,300 --> 02:01:22,060
You can pass the course by
doing everything from the
three to five and I think

2126
02:01:22,061 --> 02:01:25,960
the seven it could be running is
this target. It's a human silhouette.

2127
02:01:25,961 --> 02:01:28,280
So I mean it's a full
silhouette for of the toast.

2128
02:01:29,890 --> 02:01:33,360
So you're dealing with like a two and
a half foot, three foot target. Yeah.

2129
02:01:33,530 --> 02:01:34,870
That's almost impossible to miss.

2130
02:01:36,220 --> 02:01:39,470
And all you have to do is
get 70% and you pass. Yeah.

2131
02:01:39,770 --> 02:01:44,210
So you miss 30% at 15 yards
a giant fucking targets.

2132
02:01:44,720 --> 02:01:46,460
We're not even talking about 15 yards.
We're talking about,

2133
02:01:46,520 --> 02:01:50,450
I mean some of these from three, wait
a minute. You start from the three,

2134
02:01:50,900 --> 02:01:52,820
you do a lot of random,
they get set.

2135
02:01:52,821 --> 02:01:55,970
Hold the fuck on 70% right?

2136
02:01:55,971 --> 02:01:59,840
So you can actually qualify before
you even shoot any person I know.

2137
02:01:59,960 --> 02:02:03,980
So this isn't even adrenaline.
There's not even grazes ideal situation,

2138
02:02:04,040 --> 02:02:07,520
ideal circumstances.
So that's all it should be.

2139
02:02:07,521 --> 02:02:10,990
100% I know a hundred or they kill you.
They should kill you from it.

2140
02:02:11,150 --> 02:02:14,620
Take you a bag. Yeah, a hundred
very good. A different tribe.

2141
02:02:14,621 --> 02:02:17,720
I've had 98 from time to time.
They shouldn't be there.

2142
02:02:18,630 --> 02:02:19,850
It's staggering.

2143
02:02:19,851 --> 02:02:22,100
People don't understand what we're
talking about when you say the job is

2144
02:02:22,101 --> 02:02:25,040
impossible,
it is completely impossible.

2145
02:02:25,150 --> 02:02:28,580
Especially with the amount of
training that they have. Oh my God,

2146
02:02:28,880 --> 02:02:31,220
I don't understand how they
don't train you how to do that.

2147
02:02:31,460 --> 02:02:35,020
They don't train you how to firearm
use firearms correctly. No. Nobody.

2148
02:02:35,060 --> 02:02:37,580
Accuracy treating you how to
breathe while you're shooting.

2149
02:02:37,690 --> 02:02:42,410
They tell you all these things,
but they don't have time.

2150
02:02:42,950 --> 02:02:47,040
So the instructors, they know what they're
doing, right? They don't have time to,

2151
02:02:47,120 --> 02:02:50,600
to take somebody that has no idea what
the hell they're doing or what's even

2152
02:02:50,601 --> 02:02:54,320
worse. And somebody has bad habits and
break those habits so they can be a decent

2153
02:02:54,321 --> 02:02:57,620
shooter. It's, it's, it's, there's no
time for it and it's not gonna happen.

2154
02:02:57,621 --> 02:02:59,120
There's those standards.
So if they don't pass,

2155
02:02:59,270 --> 02:03:01,700
they just keep shooting them and shooting
and shooting and shooting till you

2156
02:03:01,701 --> 02:03:03,050
pass.
So you just keep,

2157
02:03:04,340 --> 02:03:09,320
keep doing it or you learn learning to
learn and you only do it once a year.

2158
02:03:09,830 --> 02:03:14,350
What,
what the fuck are you talking about?

2159
02:03:14,351 --> 02:03:19,340
No practice once he oh
no. Yes. Oh my God. Right.

2160
02:03:19,341 --> 02:03:21,590
That's why I'm saying I couldn't do
this job without the Marine Corps.

2161
02:03:23,010 --> 02:03:26,620
So the only reason I'm,
I was any good that from the record.

2162
02:03:26,630 --> 02:03:30,840
How many guys were in the
service that you worked with? Um,

2163
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:32,833
uh,

2164
02:03:33,110 --> 02:03:38,110
maybe 20% so 80% have no experience
hit the broad side of a barn.

2165
02:03:38,840 --> 02:03:40,610
Oh my God.

2166
02:03:43,930 --> 02:03:48,050
So these people are in this situation
where they had these expectations and

2167
02:03:48,051 --> 02:03:49,550
that's why they feel so cornered.

2168
02:03:49,551 --> 02:03:53,480
So they're actually feeling like they're
being somebody who's judging them and

2169
02:03:53,481 --> 02:03:55,670
it's not so much that they're
judging them. They're judging the,

2170
02:03:55,680 --> 02:03:59,570
the ineptitude to do the job.
It's a will Ferrell movie.

2171
02:04:00,270 --> 02:04:04,530
You could do it. I mean that's what it
feels like cops say about the banter.

2172
02:04:04,531 --> 02:04:08,030
I mean that's really, it's, it
seems that way a lot. God Damn it.

2173
02:04:08,031 --> 02:04:11,360
I can't believe that. Well why don't
I know that. I should have known that.

2174
02:04:11,720 --> 02:04:15,680
I got to get John McCarthy on. He's the
next cast, you know big John McCarthy.

2175
02:04:17,470 --> 02:04:18,770
He's got,
I got to get him on soon.

2176
02:04:19,130 --> 02:04:22,130
He got to tell him he's got some great
stories about pulling over Eddie Murphy.

2177
02:04:22,610 --> 02:04:25,460
I don't know.
I'm an Eddie Murphy Fan.

2178
02:04:25,670 --> 02:04:29,420
I will only speak with him about
him with respect and Charlie Murphy

2179
02:04:31,520 --> 02:04:34,670
anyway,
so no self defense training.

2180
02:04:35,450 --> 02:04:37,290
What is there is just

2181
02:04:37,980 --> 02:04:38,813
pointless.

2182
02:04:38,970 --> 02:04:42,660
You don't have to have like a certain
degree of proficiency in hand to hand

2183
02:04:42,661 --> 02:04:47,340
combat. No, they do like, I like
wrist locks and carries this one,

2184
02:04:47,350 --> 02:04:51,090
stuff like that. But this slot,
these are things that, you know,

2185
02:04:51,120 --> 02:04:54,090
in a real scenario we can't do.

2186
02:04:54,330 --> 02:04:57,730
So you gotta be a bad motherfucker.
Yeah.

2187
02:04:58,180 --> 02:05:01,770
You can do drill and put me to the
ground with my wrist. But in real life,

2188
02:05:01,771 --> 02:05:04,320
you'll never get in my wrist. Yeah.
It's just not going to happen.

2189
02:05:04,350 --> 02:05:06,490
If I'm fighting for my life
where I'm trying to get away,

2190
02:05:06,491 --> 02:05:09,420
it's just not gonna happen. So the
things we do just are impractical. Well,

2191
02:05:09,421 --> 02:05:12,930
Steven Seagal could get you to the ground.
Yeah.

2192
02:05:13,140 --> 02:05:16,140
Have you ever seen him seen as trying
to get to see the most recent one in

2193
02:05:16,141 --> 02:05:18,510
Russia? I'm afraid so I flipped
a bunch of people around.

2194
02:05:18,780 --> 02:05:22,530
I'm sure his hair didn't move.
One serious hair helmet he's got,

2195
02:05:24,510 --> 02:05:27,480
he's still nicely overweight.
Oh yeah. He's beautiful.

2196
02:05:27,990 --> 02:05:32,370
Beautiful fucking machine.
Can hand combat. Watch this,

2197
02:05:32,880 --> 02:05:37,830
take a look at this. I like to do rag
sweat, that sweet. Do Rag, look at this.

2198
02:05:38,220 --> 02:05:41,520
See this is what you guys need to learn
this kind of shit. Can you do that?

2199
02:05:41,550 --> 02:05:44,190
This is the kind of stuff they do and
they don't factor in the fact that they're

2200
02:05:44,191 --> 02:05:48,090
suspect is going to hook you in
the face with that empty left hand,

2201
02:05:49,470 --> 02:05:52,590
but wait a minute, look how this guy
can't do anything. I know. It's amazing.

2202
02:05:52,591 --> 02:05:53,960
It's almost like learned this,

2203
02:05:53,970 --> 02:05:58,950
this before to be the victim in
this situation. You can't. No Man.

2204
02:05:58,951 --> 02:06:00,480
I'm telling you,
you got to get Steven Seagal.

2205
02:06:00,500 --> 02:06:03,630
Teach everybody because look at the
way he just throws everybody around.

2206
02:06:03,631 --> 02:06:07,170
They have no chance. Look, he
doesn't even move. Dude. Learn this.

2207
02:06:07,470 --> 02:06:09,600
Why can't you just have empathy?
Isn't he a cop?

2208
02:06:10,200 --> 02:06:13,080
I thought he was too like a
voluntary one. No, he was a real cop.

2209
02:06:13,100 --> 02:06:16,170
I remember in Louisiana every,
he was talking like he was black.

2210
02:06:16,171 --> 02:06:18,930
If you keep talking about this,
somebody, I think he's transformational.

2211
02:06:19,260 --> 02:06:23,520
I think he's Trans Racial.
Did you ever hear him talk?

2212
02:06:23,940 --> 02:06:24,810
You're saying this now,

2213
02:06:24,811 --> 02:06:27,030
but then there's going to be some agency
that does that and thought it was a

2214
02:06:27,031 --> 02:06:30,630
good idea. It's all your fault. Should
look at this. This is beautiful.

2215
02:06:30,631 --> 02:06:32,370
If you could do this,
you could kick everyone's ass.

2216
02:06:32,580 --> 02:06:34,500
They don't even let them in the
UFC because he's too deadly.

2217
02:06:34,740 --> 02:06:38,610
We've had discussions behind closed door
meetings whether or not we should allow

2218
02:06:38,790 --> 02:06:40,830
Steven Seagal a fight
and everyone says no,

2219
02:06:41,160 --> 02:06:44,760
he's too deadly to take her out and
they need him for that is too small.

2220
02:06:44,760 --> 02:06:47,400
I'd in a different weight class
became Velasquez would be fucked.

2221
02:06:47,880 --> 02:06:50,520
Junior dos Santos. What's
you gonna do to that? Huh?

2222
02:06:50,770 --> 02:06:52,290
What are you going to do
with Fabrizio for doom?

2223
02:06:52,560 --> 02:06:57,030
Steven Seagal gets a hold of your wrist.
Huh? I haven't heard you tax wrists.

2224
02:06:58,140 --> 02:07:02,470
That's a very vulnerable spot and
I'll out like pull your hands on.

2225
02:07:03,350 --> 02:07:07,170
Isn't Joe Rogan doing it? Why don't
I have fire? Why don't you teach? No,

2226
02:07:07,171 --> 02:07:08,820
why don't you teach the cops?
Well,

2227
02:07:09,210 --> 02:07:13,380
I don't think I'm qualified because
I've never been in armed situation with

2228
02:07:13,381 --> 02:07:17,190
people shooting guns. I've never
learned how to disarm anybody in hand.

2229
02:07:17,191 --> 02:07:19,710
We don't need to arm. We don't
do this. I could, you know,

2230
02:07:19,770 --> 02:07:21,900
I copied my opinions about some shit,

2231
02:07:21,901 --> 02:07:25,140
but you should bring in legit striking
coaches that teach people all the time

2232
02:07:25,410 --> 02:07:28,520
and then legit Jujitsu coach Jujitsu.
It would be,

2233
02:07:28,521 --> 02:07:33,180
or your route because it's more
about control than depends. Hurting.

2234
02:07:33,240 --> 02:07:36,400
Well, yes, but no. Sometimes
you get to hit people,

2235
02:07:36,490 --> 02:07:41,020
like there's sometimes the idea of
only defending yourself by grappling.

2236
02:07:41,380 --> 02:07:46,270
I think mixed martial arts is the best
way to learn self defense. And uh,

2237
02:07:46,330 --> 02:07:48,160
I mean,
I'm essentially a mixed martial artists.

2238
02:07:48,161 --> 02:07:52,300
I started out as a striker and then when
I got older, when I got into the UFC,

2239
02:07:52,301 --> 02:07:54,970
that's when I really
learned grappling. But, uh,

2240
02:07:55,030 --> 02:07:59,200
I think if I had to choose one martial
art that I would teach someone to defend

2241
02:07:59,201 --> 02:08:00,910
themselves,
it would definitely be Jujitsu.

2242
02:08:01,210 --> 02:08:03,730
But as far as what I would
teach police officers,

2243
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:07,150
you got to understand striking because
if you don't understand striking and a

2244
02:08:07,151 --> 02:08:09,580
guy who can keep you off him and punch
him in the face and you don't know how to

2245
02:08:09,581 --> 02:08:13,030
deal with it, you got to understand
the way he's moving. Like if a guy,

2246
02:08:13,060 --> 02:08:15,940
if a guy is going to jab you,
there's a certain stance.

2247
02:08:15,940 --> 02:08:19,120
If a guy's going to throw a right
hand, there's tells. If you don't know,

2248
02:08:19,121 --> 02:08:21,520
those tells you.
Just going to get Molly whopped.

2249
02:08:21,850 --> 02:08:23,050
You're just going to get cracked.

2250
02:08:23,290 --> 02:08:27,610
I think you have to understand at least
understand striking and the only way to

2251
02:08:27,611 --> 02:08:31,180
understand striking is this bar. You
have to do some sparring. You have to,

2252
02:08:31,270 --> 02:08:34,180
you have to definitely learn
the mechanics of striking,

2253
02:08:34,660 --> 02:08:37,060
but you also have to
understand the distance.

2254
02:08:37,180 --> 02:08:39,880
You have to understand how when a
guy can hit you, when he can hit you,

2255
02:08:40,120 --> 02:08:41,470
even if it's just defensive,

2256
02:08:41,680 --> 02:08:44,650
even if you don't have any intention
whatsoever hitting somebody,

2257
02:08:44,830 --> 02:08:47,170
just knowing how to get
the fuck out of the way,

2258
02:08:47,380 --> 02:08:50,110
knowing how to cover yourself up,
knowing how to protect herself.

2259
02:08:50,410 --> 02:08:53,020
There's a lot of people out there that
are grapplers that we'd be fucked if

2260
02:08:53,021 --> 02:08:54,160
someone punched him in the face.

2261
02:08:54,370 --> 02:08:58,010
No, I think you're onto something with
that actually like a the defensive method.

2262
02:08:58,060 --> 02:09:00,150
We're not going to really
teach cops to strike that.

2263
02:09:00,151 --> 02:09:02,260
You're just not going to get
anywhere. Best way you're, you're,

2264
02:09:02,450 --> 02:09:04,490
you're right to the,
like the, the getaway.

2265
02:09:04,530 --> 02:09:07,280
You might actually be on to something
there that that could be that that's

2266
02:09:07,281 --> 02:09:09,590
something we should probably should
be doing because what we do is we fear

2267
02:09:09,591 --> 02:09:12,200
things, so remember we fear
that that guy can hit us.

2268
02:09:12,201 --> 02:09:16,430
We fear that should have an understanding
of whether he or she would actually be

2269
02:09:16,431 --> 02:09:20,440
capable at that range are capable.
In this particular situation.

2270
02:09:20,520 --> 02:09:25,520
Judo is good for cops to because people
most of the time are wearing clothes and

2271
02:09:25,711 --> 02:09:28,770
like if you've ever fought Ronnie Ronda
Rousey and you were wearing a fucking

2272
02:09:28,890 --> 02:09:33,720
like a, like a winter coat, that bitch
would fuck you up. You're going flying.

2273
02:09:33,900 --> 02:09:34,890
You landed on your head,

2274
02:09:35,040 --> 02:09:37,980
Carl Prezi and gets a hold of you
and you got like a leather jacket on.

2275
02:09:38,160 --> 02:09:41,460
That mother is going to throw
you and hit you with the earth.

2276
02:09:41,940 --> 02:09:43,890
That's what it's like
when someone slammed you.

2277
02:09:44,010 --> 02:09:47,370
They're taking the earth and
hitting you with it. Boom.

2278
02:09:47,520 --> 02:09:52,520
They're hitting you with a giant and
mobile fucking 24,000 mile and assert

2279
02:09:53,730 --> 02:09:58,320
circumference ball. That's what they're
doing it the earth doesn't give.

2280
02:09:59,100 --> 02:10:02,490
Someone slams you in the concrete.
They literally hitting you with the earth.

2281
02:10:03,210 --> 02:10:05,910
And I think of a judo
person gets a hold of you.

2282
02:10:05,911 --> 02:10:09,930
Some Jimmy Pedro character gets a hold
of you and you have a winter jacket on,

2283
02:10:09,990 --> 02:10:12,360
you're a fuck Ceville you know,
that's uh,

2284
02:10:12,450 --> 02:10:16,050
I think Judah would be a very
important thing to learn wrestling.

2285
02:10:16,290 --> 02:10:19,190
Very important to learn to because if
you could hold someone down and it keeps

2286
02:10:19,191 --> 02:10:20,460
coming down and you can control someone,

2287
02:10:20,760 --> 02:10:24,450
cause I've seen situations where cops
get flipped and they're holding someone

2288
02:10:24,451 --> 02:10:25,390
down in some sort of a,

2289
02:10:25,460 --> 02:10:29,820
an arrest video and they just have no
idea how to control someone's body.

2290
02:10:29,821 --> 02:10:31,410
They have no idea where
to place their weight.

2291
02:10:31,620 --> 02:10:34,610
They have no idea like
how a person would move.

2292
02:10:34,790 --> 02:10:38,420
Like it good Jujitsu guy gets a hold
of you and puts you inside control.

2293
02:10:38,510 --> 02:10:41,780
You don't have any Jujitsu training,
you're not getting up. This is it.

2294
02:10:41,810 --> 02:10:44,540
You're stuck. I mean you might
be like really physically strong.

2295
02:10:44,541 --> 02:10:46,040
You might be able to
push them a little bit,

2296
02:10:46,041 --> 02:10:49,130
but he's going to grab a hold of
you again and repeat the process.

2297
02:10:49,490 --> 02:10:52,850
And that's what we saw in UFC one
when hoists Gracie was fighting chemo.

2298
02:10:53,480 --> 02:10:56,720
What do we see? We saw this fucking
enormous steroid it up, dude.

2299
02:10:56,721 --> 02:11:00,410
It's way stronger than hoists
Gracie and he just chaos.

2300
02:11:00,411 --> 02:11:02,960
But eventually always got them.
And why did he get him? Got Him.

2301
02:11:02,961 --> 02:11:05,120
Cause he understands the technique
and you understand how to grapple.

2302
02:11:05,600 --> 02:11:10,130
I think that from one, if you only had
one, I would say Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.

2303
02:11:10,131 --> 02:11:11,390
But if I was gonna teach
something to comps,

2304
02:11:11,391 --> 02:11:12,770
I would definitely teach them striking.

2305
02:11:12,771 --> 02:11:15,500
The last thing you want to do is be
someone who doesn't know how to strike and

2306
02:11:15,501 --> 02:11:18,290
you get punched in the face and you're,
you're seeing stars,

2307
02:11:18,500 --> 02:11:19,700
you're eyes are watery,

2308
02:11:19,910 --> 02:11:22,160
your legs are buckled and you
don't know what the fuck to do.

2309
02:11:22,161 --> 02:11:24,530
Cause he never been there before.
Somebody knows what to do.

2310
02:11:24,531 --> 02:11:27,470
Someone who's been there before has been
popped in the face before you got to go.

2311
02:11:27,480 --> 02:11:30,710
Oh, all right, got to keep my
hands up. Gotta move. Gotta
move gotta move. You know,

2312
02:11:30,711 --> 02:11:35,630
you'll instinctively have like a path
that you'll go to to preserve yourself.

2313
02:11:35,980 --> 02:11:36,380
The,

2314
02:11:36,380 --> 02:11:38,990
the scariest thing in the world is
watching someone in a street fight and you

2315
02:11:38,991 --> 02:11:40,990
know, they don't know how to
fight and they just, their,

2316
02:11:40,991 --> 02:11:45,050
their neck is up in the air and they're
flailing fists and you know, it's coming,

2317
02:11:45,140 --> 02:11:47,240
you know, you know it's coming
and we've all seen videos.

2318
02:11:47,600 --> 02:11:48,830
You can go online and watch.

2319
02:11:48,831 --> 02:11:52,700
Guy Gets Kod and street fight and
there's a million videos of that.

2320
02:11:53,330 --> 02:11:58,330
I just can't believe that they don't
force you guys to train first of all in

2321
02:11:58,491 --> 02:12:01,880
firearms on a regular base. I would
always thought that'd be a weekly thing.

2322
02:12:02,150 --> 02:12:05,010
I really thought that there was like a
weekly thing that you guys had to do the

2323
02:12:05,030 --> 02:12:06,950
physical standards as well.
Yeah,

2324
02:12:06,980 --> 02:12:09,530
I've seen a lot faster because there's
not a physical standard whatsoever.

2325
02:12:09,560 --> 02:12:14,280
Well how about chicks? Oh, have
standards. They don't have to have a, the,

2326
02:12:14,370 --> 02:12:17,270
you don't have to at least be able to
like lift their body weight or something

2327
02:12:17,271 --> 02:12:18,460
or do a chin up or something like that.

2328
02:12:18,470 --> 02:12:19,880
You get through the academy
and you're finished.

2329
02:12:19,910 --> 02:12:22,100
What do you have to do to get through
the academy or whatever. It is.

2330
02:12:22,190 --> 02:12:27,150
Pathetic and easy. That
seems weird. It is weird. Uh,

2331
02:12:27,430 --> 02:12:32,430
and in Baltimore they had an issue with
a fire cadet who ended up dying and

2332
02:12:32,841 --> 02:12:33,800
training because they,

2333
02:12:34,610 --> 02:12:36,620
they just didn't maintain the physical
standards they needed to make.

2334
02:12:38,310 --> 02:12:42,900
Now why is that? Is it hard to get
people to join the police force?

2335
02:12:43,110 --> 02:12:44,920
So you have to lower
the physical standards.

2336
02:12:45,260 --> 02:12:48,650
One reason why the job was impossible
there. Society doesn't seem to be willing.

2337
02:12:49,040 --> 02:12:53,600
Okay. So at this point in time,
not to sound too arrogant.

2338
02:12:53,750 --> 02:12:56,720
Too late. Too late. Okay. So
it's amaze. Well, go for it.

2339
02:12:57,350 --> 02:13:01,040
I would be the prototype.
Okay. I have a master's degree.

2340
02:13:01,310 --> 02:13:04,770
I'm confident I came from
the, from the military. Uh,

2341
02:13:04,790 --> 02:13:07,040
if you go through my training record,
you'll see it. It's all there.

2342
02:13:07,700 --> 02:13:11,960
I would be the prototype. I'm what
you're looking for, but I still,

2343
02:13:12,800 --> 02:13:17,420
you're not willing to pay me what it would
take to get somebody like me normally

2344
02:13:17,421 --> 02:13:22,220
to do it. So, so if you, right now,
if I went to a police department,

2345
02:13:22,460 --> 02:13:26,240
they would be offering me
$42,000 a year. Really? I mean,

2346
02:13:26,600 --> 02:13:29,480
you don't think I'm going to take away
2000 a year job to you at this point in

2347
02:13:29,481 --> 02:13:32,130
time. It's not going to
happen. So, so they're not

2348
02:13:32,130 --> 02:13:34,710
investing in those officers.
I really think in a,

2349
02:13:34,711 --> 02:13:36,960
in most areas where like a Baltimore,
you have 3000 officers,

2350
02:13:37,080 --> 02:13:39,870
I really think you could do
the job with a thousand. So,

2351
02:13:39,920 --> 02:13:42,270
so you would pay those guys,

2352
02:13:42,680 --> 02:13:46,950
get those guys and you'd get the guys
with the education and girls and have

2353
02:13:46,951 --> 02:13:50,910
those standards.
And I really think that one really,

2354
02:13:50,911 --> 02:13:55,680
really good cop can do the job of
the four or five of what we have now,

2355
02:13:55,710 --> 02:13:59,850
how much harder is it to be a woman
and be a cop? Incredibly hard.

2356
02:14:00,700 --> 02:14:04,530
Imagine, be really hard to get people.
Some of them are so freaking good though.

2357
02:14:04,840 --> 02:14:09,630
Um, so that's the weird line. You tow.
They do seem to make better detectives.

2358
02:14:10,620 --> 02:14:15,030
Um, as a general rule, they have
an advantage and a lot of things.

2359
02:14:15,050 --> 02:14:18,930
I think they're more empathetic, which is
one of my big pushes. They're, they're,

2360
02:14:18,931 --> 02:14:21,090
they're more considerate
of others when it,

2361
02:14:21,120 --> 02:14:24,180
when it comes to a lot and it's
harder for them with fighting.

2362
02:14:24,330 --> 02:14:26,730
But I've seen some of them
hold their own just fine.

2363
02:14:26,910 --> 02:14:31,380
And the hardest one was
actually a flamboyantly gay
cop than I know he had the

2364
02:14:31,381 --> 02:14:35,880
hardest time and I loved that
guy. Flamboyantly gay cop.

2365
02:14:35,910 --> 02:14:40,060
I love him so much. He Gay. Was he very,
he's the queen and so he referred to,

2366
02:14:40,530 --> 02:14:43,710
he calls himself the claim is the queen
of the northern. That's beautiful.

2367
02:14:43,711 --> 02:14:47,700
That's what we need to stop fucking
army of roided up gay cops and he's,

2368
02:14:48,120 --> 02:14:49,860
he would fight all the time.

2369
02:14:50,110 --> 02:14:53,850
If you could go to battle with that
dude any day and you could trust that he

2370
02:14:53,851 --> 02:14:56,790
would have your back,
you could follow him day and night.

2371
02:14:56,791 --> 02:15:01,650
Cause he was tried constantly and
he became, he was always good.

2372
02:15:02,080 --> 02:15:04,770
Love that dude. Awesome cop
to work with. But he was,

2373
02:15:04,920 --> 02:15:07,230
he constantly lived in a
different world than I did.

2374
02:15:07,230 --> 02:15:11,520
I was maybe I fell into that medium frame
where like I'm not too big to try and

2375
02:15:11,521 --> 02:15:12,600
I'm not too small to try.

2376
02:15:12,930 --> 02:15:17,520
So I kind of got away with a lot because
she was tried all the time because he's

2377
02:15:17,521 --> 02:15:22,080
flamboyantly gay. Yeah. So did he be
like license and registration? He was,

2378
02:15:22,081 --> 02:15:25,470
he has the voice, so he really say that
when he pulled people over and stuff.

2379
02:15:25,530 --> 02:15:29,950
Oh yeah. Well you going and he had a
purse for a while. Let me think about,

2380
02:15:30,140 --> 02:15:33,130
think about that though. I
love it because you do it, but

2381
02:15:35,460 --> 02:15:39,720
that's true. I actually
don't know. I don't know.

2382
02:15:39,900 --> 02:15:44,430
Maybe cause you gave it to me. I think I
do, but I thought about that. The airport,

2383
02:15:44,431 --> 02:15:44,911
like you say,

2384
02:15:44,911 --> 02:15:49,860
it's like if it would be so much easier
that people are just scared of not

2385
02:15:49,861 --> 02:15:51,300
getting laid,
that's why they don't have it.

2386
02:15:51,600 --> 02:15:54,370
They're scared of the fashion stigma
attached to it. It's bullshit.

2387
02:15:55,240 --> 02:15:56,073
It's what it is.

2388
02:15:56,290 --> 02:16:00,180
I wear one of those mother
fuckers everywhere and then
meet me and they go, dude,

2389
02:16:00,181 --> 02:16:02,700
you really wearing a fanny pack.
I'm like, that's right bitch.

2390
02:16:03,120 --> 02:16:04,230
That shit's real as fuck.

2391
02:16:08,890 --> 02:16:12,240
Why is that? Why is that a
problem? But if I wear a backpack,

2392
02:16:12,330 --> 02:16:16,050
I'm saying it's that same confidence
that you have with the confidence that he

2393
02:16:16,051 --> 02:16:18,570
has. Cause I'm married, I'm not
trying to get laid. It was admirable.

2394
02:16:18,571 --> 02:16:21,180
If I was struggling to try
to get laid, I was like, man,

2395
02:16:21,181 --> 02:16:24,720
it was window and hit her mess. I was just
had to be dressed perfectly. You know?

2396
02:16:24,721 --> 02:16:27,780
That's what I do to wear Cologne and
shit like that. And designer shoes. Why?

2397
02:16:27,781 --> 02:16:30,070
Cause they fucking trying to
tip the scales in their favor.

2398
02:16:30,370 --> 02:16:32,740
They're not confident in their personality
and their accomplishments and how

2399
02:16:32,741 --> 02:16:34,660
they come off as,
as a human being.

2400
02:16:34,710 --> 02:16:37,750
They've got to get to wear the right
clothes and the right style and that fanny

2401
02:16:37,751 --> 02:16:41,560
pack and fucking sick your
battle. Chet dammit. I had her,

2402
02:16:41,980 --> 02:16:44,530
she could have been the one that married,
had kids.

2403
02:16:44,590 --> 02:16:48,820
I was that fucking stupid panty
fanny pack. I fucked my chances.

2404
02:16:49,840 --> 02:16:52,540
I don't know if that's why.
I think you've got enough game.

2405
02:16:52,541 --> 02:16:54,730
You can do it with a fanny pack.
That's what I think.

2406
02:16:54,731 --> 02:16:56,890
I think if a girl doesn't
want to have sex with you,

2407
02:16:56,891 --> 02:16:58,840
it doesn't want to date you
because you have a fanny pack.

2408
02:16:59,020 --> 02:17:03,550
You don't want her in your life. She's
too much work. That's too much work.

2409
02:17:03,580 --> 02:17:05,740
Or you don't know how
to make fun of yourself.

2410
02:17:05,980 --> 02:17:08,890
You can't even mock the fact that you
were in a fanny pack and then explain

2411
02:17:08,891 --> 02:17:11,380
yourself can make a good show. And she's
like, why are you wearing a fanny pack?

2412
02:17:11,381 --> 02:17:13,060
Stupid. You're like, exactly.

2413
02:17:15,340 --> 02:17:17,620
Anyway, he wore a purse. Yeah,

2414
02:17:17,621 --> 02:17:21,780
he keep this kind of purse goes it
like glittery or anything. He had it.

2415
02:17:21,781 --> 02:17:25,960
It would have been stylish. It
wasn't, it wasn't no chump shit.

2416
02:17:27,430 --> 02:17:30,370
So, um, what, what was it like for him?

2417
02:17:30,371 --> 02:17:32,470
I mean I think it was
incredibly challenging for him.

2418
02:17:33,930 --> 02:17:38,800
Like they wouldn't let him arrest him.
Like they would fight like,

2419
02:17:38,860 --> 02:17:42,940
like no way. I understand I'm
going to jail but not from him.

2420
02:17:47,800 --> 02:17:51,430
Is He still on a job? Yeah, he's awesome.
Too. Good for him. What's his name?

2421
02:17:51,820 --> 02:17:54,370
I don't know. Just give his full
name. His first name. No, no.

2422
02:17:54,371 --> 02:17:55,790
I just want to give a shout out to him.

2423
02:17:56,590 --> 02:18:01,570
You can call que que you keep it sexy,
keep it sexy queue.

2424
02:18:04,960 --> 02:18:07,720
So harder for him than
women. Yeah, I think so.

2425
02:18:07,721 --> 02:18:10,530
I think it's incredibly hard for him.
And she was saying that women make better

2426
02:18:10,620 --> 02:18:15,040
detectives. What, what else besides
empathy? Do they have like intuition? It's

2427
02:18:15,040 --> 02:18:15,420
better.

2428
02:18:15,420 --> 02:18:20,410
I mean I can't say but they s they do
seem to fulfill those roles very well.

2429
02:18:20,680 --> 02:18:24,100
Hmm. Yeah. So there's a role
for females in policing.

2430
02:18:24,130 --> 02:18:28,270
Even if you're thinking of the
physical aspects, uh, there,

2431
02:18:28,271 --> 02:18:32,950
there is a like a need. Right?
So how you balance that?

2432
02:18:33,250 --> 02:18:37,660
I can't say that it required a little
more nuance, but definitely have a role.

2433
02:18:37,690 --> 02:18:39,490
Is there anything else you want
to say before we get out of here?

2434
02:18:39,491 --> 02:18:40,930
Cause I know you've got
a bunch of notes there.

2435
02:18:42,220 --> 02:18:47,220
It's just that one of the big things
that we see is everybody keeps fighting

2436
02:18:48,491 --> 02:18:49,930
against the black lives matter thing.

2437
02:18:50,490 --> 02:18:53,170
And it's like we're not
understanding what it is.

2438
02:18:53,470 --> 02:18:57,010
It's not that we come out
with things all lives matters.

2439
02:18:57,020 --> 02:19:00,670
Might wear a shirt all lives matter. No,
no shit. We understand all lives matter.

2440
02:19:00,700 --> 02:19:02,320
That's the whole point
of everything we do.

2441
02:19:02,680 --> 02:19:05,140
And they come out and they say
police lives matter. No Shit.

2442
02:19:05,170 --> 02:19:07,360
I don't know a life that's
mattered more than a police life.

2443
02:19:07,450 --> 02:19:09,880
I don't know of a single cop has been
killed or the killer wasn't called,

2444
02:19:09,970 --> 02:19:11,500
which is embarrassing for our profession.

2445
02:19:11,560 --> 02:19:14,010
Why do we always catch the
ones that hurt our own? Hmm.

2446
02:19:14,050 --> 02:19:15,550
Maybe we're not trying hard enough.
And the other ones,

2447
02:19:16,240 --> 02:19:20,200
and we go around and we say these things,

2448
02:19:20,230 --> 02:19:24,010
but the police, everyone comes to their
aid when something happens to them.

2449
02:19:24,310 --> 02:19:28,220
But when we, somebody says black
lives matter, we just, Oh, oh,

2450
02:19:28,250 --> 02:19:32,180
oh. But what they're, it's all they're
saying is, is that in our society,

2451
02:19:32,270 --> 02:19:36,290
black lives haven't mattered as much
as the other lives. And that's clear.

2452
02:19:36,350 --> 02:19:38,840
When you see something like Tamir Rice,

2453
02:19:38,960 --> 02:19:41,450
because you know that doesn't
happen then one of your kids,

2454
02:19:41,480 --> 02:19:46,190
there's not a shot in hell that that
happens to my daughter or yours. No Way.

2455
02:19:46,910 --> 02:19:50,300
Whether there are 12 year olds sit with
a BB gun in the middle of your street in

2456
02:19:50,301 --> 02:19:53,930
front of your house. That is not going
to happen because they're going to say,

2457
02:19:53,960 --> 02:19:55,760
oh well no you don't.
We're going to handle that situation.

2458
02:19:55,761 --> 02:19:57,710
We're going to approach her.
We're going to see what's really going on.

2459
02:19:57,860 --> 02:20:01,640
And they're not going to be a hero because
a hero is the person that goes up to

2460
02:20:01,641 --> 02:20:04,730
Tamir rice and approaches
and tries to figure it out,

2461
02:20:04,760 --> 02:20:08,480
risk getting shot because he wants to
make sure he's doing the right thing.

2462
02:20:08,480 --> 02:20:11,390
When you take away a life or
take away somebody's freedom,

2463
02:20:11,540 --> 02:20:12,710
you don't even have to go up to them.

2464
02:20:12,770 --> 02:20:16,060
How about you just say from the comfort
of the car, put down the gun. Sure, sure.

2465
02:20:16,430 --> 02:20:20,810
From far away, you know, figure it
out because w but we go and we, we,

2466
02:20:20,820 --> 02:20:24,620
we treat black lives like they don't
matter. And when you were putting that,

2467
02:20:24,680 --> 02:20:26,720
oh yeah,
all lives matter shirt on or oh yeah,

2468
02:20:26,721 --> 02:20:30,430
police lives matter on your proving
that police lives don't, that,

2469
02:20:30,431 --> 02:20:32,690
that black lives aren't
mattering as much to you.

2470
02:20:32,840 --> 02:20:37,100
Otherwise you would just
fucking say, yes they do. Right.

2471
02:20:37,130 --> 02:20:41,720
So they're not saying that white lives
don't matter. Let matter. Bring it up,

2472
02:20:41,721 --> 02:20:45,270
bring it up to everyone else.
That's it. Just a quality. It's not,

2473
02:20:45,620 --> 02:20:47,180
it's not a dis on anybody else.

2474
02:20:47,210 --> 02:20:51,710
It's we have this problem and we
have this problem. Recognize it,

2475
02:20:51,830 --> 02:20:56,150
let's fix it. That's when I say
that I want to team up with the ray.

2476
02:20:56,210 --> 02:20:59,900
So if I took a uh, police commissioner
job, the first thing I would do is say,

2477
02:20:59,960 --> 02:21:04,820
Deray, please come join me
please because I need you.

2478
02:21:04,970 --> 02:21:06,830
I need him.
He's a community leader.

2479
02:21:06,920 --> 02:21:10,310
The idea that we don't integrate
people like him into our system is

2480
02:21:10,400 --> 02:21:15,380
ridiculousness. He is a leader of
the black community. I need him.

2481
02:21:15,410 --> 02:21:18,890
If I'm going to run a police agency and
we should not be turning those kinds of

2482
02:21:18,891 --> 02:21:21,010
people away and acts
and making like there,

2483
02:21:21,120 --> 02:21:24,450
there was some kind of instigators from
Abbott town is what they would call the

2484
02:21:25,070 --> 02:21:29,270
instigator.
That's what they call them out of town,

2485
02:21:29,271 --> 02:21:34,070
instigator that he was coming to Baltimore
and he's making money and he's doing

2486
02:21:34,071 --> 02:21:35,870
all this and it's not an
equal one and he's doing,

2487
02:21:35,871 --> 02:21:39,520
they think he's making money doing all
this and he's simply not. Neither am I.

2488
02:21:39,570 --> 02:21:41,900
I mean we came out here on our
own arm dime with the help of,

2489
02:21:41,901 --> 02:21:46,760
well you know who's making money?
That's how sharp and CNN and Fox News,

2490
02:21:46,820 --> 02:21:51,260
anybody broadcasting it where they're
going to get advertising dollars and

2491
02:21:51,261 --> 02:21:54,880
that's something that's going to get a
lot of people watching certainly is our

2492
02:21:54,881 --> 02:21:57,920
ratings went up.
I went down to where Freddie gray was,

2493
02:21:58,010 --> 02:22:01,820
the incident happened and where
the uprising was the very next day.

2494
02:22:02,600 --> 02:22:06,020
You couldn't have told me that there was
a difference between that day and two

2495
02:22:06,021 --> 02:22:06,854
weeks ago.

2496
02:22:06,890 --> 02:22:09,920
The problem is that no one gave a shit
about Gilmore homes two weeks ago,

2497
02:22:10,310 --> 02:22:14,000
but when it comes on the news and you
saw the cvs burning and they cycled it

2498
02:22:14,001 --> 02:22:17,330
over and over and over again, it was
one God damn building that was burning.

2499
02:22:17,331 --> 02:22:20,240
You just kept seeing it over and over
after the fire department had already put

2500
02:22:20,241 --> 02:22:24,990
it out. Violence in violence in Baltimore,
the riots and all of these tapes,

2501
02:22:25,150 --> 02:22:26,190
that fucking news

2502
02:22:26,190 --> 02:22:27,960
voice,
you're your own and exactly.

2503
02:22:28,380 --> 02:22:32,760
And we do that and then we look at that
community and we're like, oh my God,

2504
02:22:32,761 --> 02:22:36,810
why would they do that? Well, nothing ever
happens without it. Without an uprising.

2505
02:22:36,910 --> 02:22:41,550
What ever great civil rights movement or
great progress if we ever made without

2506
02:22:41,551 --> 02:22:44,620
some kind of uprising. How about
the United States of America? Yeah.

2507
02:22:45,120 --> 02:22:48,000
This came about because we got
away from the fucking British.

2508
02:22:48,030 --> 02:22:51,510
I mean that's literally how this
got started. It was an uprising.

2509
02:22:52,230 --> 02:22:57,030
Boston tea party. It's a goddamn uprising.
And is anybody sit there and say,

2510
02:22:57,060 --> 02:22:59,670
oh my God, why did they just throw
their own tea in to the water?

2511
02:22:59,671 --> 02:23:02,700
That's ridiculousness.
But they don't hesitate to say,

2512
02:23:02,790 --> 02:23:04,470
why are they burning that cvs down?

2513
02:23:04,500 --> 02:23:08,820
Well that's the only symbolism
of corporate America that
they even have their,

2514
02:23:08,821 --> 02:23:11,100
cause they don't have a grocery
store like you and I do.

2515
02:23:11,250 --> 02:23:15,660
They don't have anything that
we think of as as as normality.

2516
02:23:15,661 --> 02:23:20,400
They live in a, in an area that has food
deserts, that doesn't have good schools,

2517
02:23:20,401 --> 02:23:24,470
where the kids ride MTA buses to go to
school where the life is and, and their,

2518
02:23:24,590 --> 02:23:25,890
their parents get,

2519
02:23:25,891 --> 02:23:29,400
their father gets locked up because he
has that dime bag and he perpetuates a

2520
02:23:29,401 --> 02:23:29,761
cycle,

2521
02:23:29,761 --> 02:23:33,050
but yet society keeps telling them or
we'll pick yourself up by your bootstraps

2522
02:23:33,051 --> 02:23:37,330
and I'm fucking have bootstraps because
you took them away by your boobs.

2523
02:23:37,331 --> 02:23:41,550
Judge is such a shitty argument. It's not
like everybody starts in the same spot.

2524
02:23:41,580 --> 02:23:41,821
You know?

2525
02:23:41,821 --> 02:23:45,510
It's not like we're all playing monopoly
and we all start from the same spot.

2526
02:23:45,511 --> 02:23:47,640
It's stupid.
That's such a terrible,

2527
02:23:47,641 --> 02:23:51,870
terrible mentality that people have and
it's so short sided and so dismissive.

2528
02:23:52,440 --> 02:23:57,120
Pull yourself up by your bootstraps.
It's just so dumb. It's such a short,

2529
02:23:57,121 --> 02:24:00,660
and that's a short sided conservative
argument that is a conservative argument.

2530
02:24:01,140 --> 02:24:03,960
It's just such a dumb one.
Well,

2531
02:24:04,290 --> 02:24:09,290
the last thing I wanted to say too is
that conservatives and right wing people

2532
02:24:10,621 --> 02:24:12,660
are the ones that are going
to argue with me the most.

2533
02:24:14,310 --> 02:24:16,560
If we don't do what I'm saying,

2534
02:24:17,010 --> 02:24:20,820
then they're going to lose their guns and
their argument that they want to have.

2535
02:24:20,970 --> 02:24:24,330
Because if we can't reel in police and
they're always afraid that everyone has a

2536
02:24:24,331 --> 02:24:26,250
gun and we have to do this war,

2537
02:24:26,850 --> 02:24:31,230
then that means we can't live in a society
that's armed and we can't police it

2538
02:24:31,231 --> 02:24:34,110
properly. You just said that a
bunch of people just look, Bro,

2539
02:24:34,620 --> 02:24:38,910
what the fuck lose my guns? Right? What'd
you say? Sorry. Should take my flag.

2540
02:24:40,080 --> 02:24:44,580
You're taking my fucking gun. Not,
nope. If you want to keep your guns,

2541
02:24:44,610 --> 02:24:46,350
Charlton Heston said,
yeah,

2542
02:24:46,740 --> 02:24:51,390
you can pry my cold dead hands
from it if you want. Well,

2543
02:24:51,600 --> 02:24:52,830
if you want to keep your guns,

2544
02:24:53,670 --> 02:24:56,940
then we need to have reform in policing.

2545
02:24:57,060 --> 02:24:59,700
I don't like this kind of language because
people are going to keep their guns.

2546
02:24:59,880 --> 02:25:02,370
They're keeping the fucking
gun unless reform policing.

2547
02:25:02,550 --> 02:25:05,850
I think that's a great idea. I don't
think you need to bring guns into this.

2548
02:25:05,990 --> 02:25:09,830
You know, guns and do anything to anybody.
What did the cops can on people. People.

2549
02:25:09,880 --> 02:25:12,780
People are doing it. People kill
people. People are killing people.

2550
02:25:13,410 --> 02:25:15,090
Guns are just sitting
there looking beautiful.

2551
02:25:15,210 --> 02:25:19,460
How many gun deaths happened in England?
Ah, fucking English. Bunch of pussies.

2552
02:25:19,461 --> 02:25:23,100
Scared to pull the trigger. So the
argument though, it has a funny

2553
02:25:24,300 --> 02:25:27,430
imagine. We turns out they all
had guns. I can't quite do it.

2554
02:25:28,370 --> 02:25:33,060
I was thinking about shooting just
doesn't seem Brian who's Robert Wright

2555
02:25:33,970 --> 02:25:37,750
wouldn't be proper.
Yeah, no, I, uh, listen,

2556
02:25:37,780 --> 02:25:40,960
I think you're saying some awesome things.
We do have to wrap this up, but uh,

2557
02:25:41,020 --> 02:25:43,900
I really, really appreciate you
coming on and I think you, uh,

2558
02:25:44,230 --> 02:25:47,790
you express yourself very well and uh,
I think that you're,

2559
02:25:47,791 --> 02:25:50,710
you're a very unique person.
Your perspective is very unique.

2560
02:25:50,711 --> 02:25:53,800
The fact that you have so much
experience and you're, you're,

2561
02:25:53,801 --> 02:25:57,280
you're saying all the right things.
So thank you very much. I really,

2562
02:25:57,281 --> 02:26:02,080
really appreciate it. Um, you could
catch him on Twitter. Michael A.

2563
02:26:02,080 --> 02:26:06,760
Wood Jr.
M I C h a e l a wood w.

2564
02:26:06,761 --> 02:26:11,020
O o d junior. Um, last
thing. Anything else? Yeah,

2565
02:26:11,710 --> 02:26:14,890
I mean, this is a great, no, this is
not about me. This is about the point.

2566
02:26:15,040 --> 02:26:18,250
Where's the best place for people to
reach you? Just Twitter. Just Twitter.

2567
02:26:18,251 --> 02:26:21,640
This is not about me. This is about the
message. I appreciate that very much.

2568
02:26:22,330 --> 02:26:25,630
Michael would junior ladies and gentlemen,
a bad motherfucker.

2569
02:26:25,990 --> 02:26:28,180
You have been schooled.
See you guys soon.
