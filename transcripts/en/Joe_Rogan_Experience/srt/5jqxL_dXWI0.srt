00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:02,880
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:04,480
And I feel like you guys,

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:07,340
I bought the chicken and stuff,

4
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:10,170
believe it at first I didn't believe it.

5
00:00:10,171 --> 00:00:10,901
I'm like someone said,

6
00:00:10,901 --> 00:00:14,360
well explain it to people who didn't hear
our other podcasts and I'll tell me on

7
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:14,941
the finals,

8
00:00:14,941 --> 00:00:16,260
well the match we're talking about,

9
00:00:16,261 --> 00:00:19,890
and me and Joe talked about this and
they made a Stewart Cooper made a film on

10
00:00:19,891 --> 00:00:20,011
it,

11
00:00:20,011 --> 00:00:22,510
but Oh Tavio Sousa.

12
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:27,000
His strategy was to not be honest back,

13
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:31,590
stay on top and just kind of
maybe get a takedown late,

14
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:32,011
you know,

15
00:00:32,011 --> 00:00:36,720
cause that's in that rule format or that
points format in Abu Dhabi that that

16
00:00:36,721 --> 00:00:37,141
happens.

17
00:00:37,141 --> 00:00:40,310
A lot of people will just Russell
and Russell and Russell and uh,

18
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:41,280
he wasn't engaging.

19
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:42,630
And crone is like,

20
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:43,201
like,

21
00:00:43,201 --> 00:00:44,280
just like in saying,

22
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,300
he's like Marcello,

23
00:00:45,301 --> 00:00:45,750
he's like,

24
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,070
he goes after it,

25
00:00:47,071 --> 00:00:49,920
he's going to go 100% all
he wants is the submission.

26
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:50,590
That's cronies,

27
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:52,140
especial grappler,

28
00:00:52,141 --> 00:00:52,980
special fighter.

29
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:55,260
All he wants us is the submission.

30
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:56,141
And Oh,

31
00:00:56,141 --> 00:00:57,930
Tevya wasn't really engaging.

32
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:00,060
And as a father,

33
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:00,360
no,

34
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:00,780
no,

35
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:01,090
no,

36
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:02,470
not as a fine as a coach.

37
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:07,120
I saw his coach as the fight progress.

38
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:09,640
The Guy St [inaudible] in Portuguese.

39
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:10,331
Okay man,

40
00:01:10,331 --> 00:01:10,871
that's it.

41
00:01:10,871 --> 00:01:11,860
That's all you want.

42
00:01:11,861 --> 00:01:12,221
Okay,

43
00:01:12,221 --> 00:01:12,761
keep going.

44
00:01:12,761 --> 00:01:13,510
It's perfect.

45
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:14,140
Perfect.

46
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:14,950
Perfect.

47
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:19,360
And I see a guy just running from
the fight and making strategy,

48
00:01:19,361 --> 00:01:21,760
which kind of upset me completely.

49
00:01:21,761 --> 00:01:24,340
I mean there's nothing
perfect on that in my sense.

50
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,380
And but in these strategic aspect of his,

51
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:28,543
he's doing,

52
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:34,020
so I have to counter in somehow
and then I start your make shoot,

53
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:36,130
tried to suggest the referee.

54
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:37,150
He was escaping.

55
00:01:37,151 --> 00:01:41,530
He was try to avoid the fight because
he's not positive points in the first 10

56
00:01:41,531 --> 00:01:41,921
minutes,

57
00:01:41,921 --> 00:01:42,940
but it's negative points.

58
00:01:42,941 --> 00:01:43,241
So I,

59
00:01:43,241 --> 00:01:47,330
I was hoping for a negative
point with dot well fall.

60
00:01:47,331 --> 00:01:48,164
This is stalling.

61
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:48,761
So,

62
00:01:48,761 --> 00:01:49,550
and then I started to say,

63
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:50,200
Henry,

64
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:50,771
the guy start,

65
00:01:50,771 --> 00:01:51,461
you're moving like,

66
00:01:51,461 --> 00:01:51,791
you know,

67
00:01:51,791 --> 00:01:52,611
he don't want to engage you.

68
00:01:52,611 --> 00:01:54,320
It's just moving back like a chicken la,

69
00:01:54,321 --> 00:01:54,650
la,

70
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:54,930
la,

71
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:55,763
la.

72
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,090
And as the thing starts,

73
00:01:57,091 --> 00:01:57,924
you're boiling.

74
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:58,841
I start to say,

75
00:01:58,841 --> 00:01:59,241
hey man,

76
00:01:59,241 --> 00:02:00,250
this guy like a chicken.

77
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:04,980
And the whole stage was this quiet.

78
00:02:04,981 --> 00:02:08,270
Watching the fight is just this
noise kind of overwhelming.

79
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:13,890
It's like throwing a chicken inside
it in a for a Jujitsu competitor.

80
00:02:13,891 --> 00:02:14,724
First of all.

81
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,010
I mean I know you're right here,

82
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:18,090
but I just have to be honest.

83
00:02:18,091 --> 00:02:20,100
Everybody says you're the greatest ever.

84
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:22,140
You're the greatest Jujitsu
competitor of all time.

85
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:25,590
So you are here the greatest
Jujitsu representative all time.

86
00:02:25,591 --> 00:02:26,880
Your son is competing.

87
00:02:26,881 --> 00:02:31,881
This guy has to respect you and
admire you and you're going bock,

88
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:32,281
bock,

89
00:02:32,281 --> 00:02:32,451
bock,

90
00:02:32,451 --> 00:02:32,611
bock,

91
00:02:32,611 --> 00:02:32,811
bock,

92
00:02:32,811 --> 00:02:32,970
bock.

93
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:35,280
And the whole crowd is listening to this.

94
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:39,140
I mean that's a lot of pressure on that
guy to get into his head because it is

95
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,013
going,

96
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:44,530
because I was was suggesting the
referee he needs should be punished.

97
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:45,250
Yeah.

98
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:48,490
And eventually like with 90 minutes or so,

99
00:02:48,491 --> 00:02:53,491
he get minus points and that's what's
exactly what generates him to say,

100
00:02:53,621 --> 00:02:53,921
okay,

101
00:02:53,921 --> 00:02:54,630
now I'm honeybee,

102
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:56,410
raw honey running behind.

103
00:02:56,740 --> 00:03:01,420
So I have to make it happen and as talk
and afterwards we've grown crone said,

104
00:03:01,421 --> 00:03:01,840
dad,

105
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,591
when I do start,

106
00:03:02,591 --> 00:03:03,670
you're talking like a chicken.

107
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,540
I felt like you want to explore them.

108
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,350
I don't want to make a mistake
wasting the opportunity,

109
00:03:08,351 --> 00:03:09,400
but I know he will come.

110
00:03:09,401 --> 00:03:10,960
He so I was just ready for it.

111
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:12,750
So we kind of working together,

112
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:13,070
you know,

113
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:16,330
like the father and son Ward was perfect.

114
00:03:16,331 --> 00:03:18,930
He shot right in and then
he's already waiting for me.

115
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:19,803
Boom is over.

116
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:20,850
Go home.

117
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:21,111
Oh,

118
00:03:21,111 --> 00:03:21,944
it's ice cream.

119
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:27,730
Isn't it weird how it like most cities
it's always like the south side is the

120
00:03:27,731 --> 00:03:28,331
bad side.

121
00:03:28,331 --> 00:03:29,164
It's like whoa.

122
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:30,920
Really?

123
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:31,570
Yeah,

124
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:32,403
that's what's good.

125
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:33,670
What's the best area to live in?

126
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,740
North Tampa is where
all the rednecks live.

127
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,633
That's where I grew up.

128
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:37,653
North Tampa,

129
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:38,583
Tampa,

130
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:39,670
elevated trucks.

131
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:40,240
Shit,

132
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,170
you got it.

133
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:42,191
Fireworks,

134
00:03:42,191 --> 00:03:43,030
homemade fireworks,

135
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,133
fireworks,

136
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,440
hunting gators,

137
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:46,421
hunting gators.

138
00:03:46,421 --> 00:03:47,080
When you were a kid.

139
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:47,290
Oh,

140
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:47,710
when I,

141
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:48,011
when I,

142
00:03:48,011 --> 00:03:48,760
when we,

143
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,960
I'll never forget,

144
00:03:49,961 --> 00:03:51,730
when we went to look at our land,

145
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:55,300
my dad bought like a piece of land
in North Dakota in north Florida,

146
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:56,081
Tampa and he was like,

147
00:03:56,081 --> 00:03:56,914
we're going to build on it.

148
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:01,630
We went out as a family to go look at it
and there were these two rednecks that

149
00:04:01,631 --> 00:04:04,900
had chased this other redneck in his
underwear up on a mound in the middle of

150
00:04:04,901 --> 00:04:06,490
the lake and they were
shooting Bibi's Adam.

151
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:07,930
Mike is your land.

152
00:04:07,931 --> 00:04:09,650
This is our land and my
day and this is our lake.

153
00:04:09,651 --> 00:04:10,680
And that land that,

154
00:04:10,681 --> 00:04:11,514
that little mound,

155
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:13,110
I wish I had a picture
cause it's still there.

156
00:04:13,111 --> 00:04:13,220
I,

157
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,053
it's still there.

158
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:16,360
And they had chased the
boy up there in his,

159
00:04:16,361 --> 00:04:18,340
and he was in his underwear
and my dad was like,

160
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:18,671
hey,

161
00:04:18,671 --> 00:04:19,600
everybody cut it out.

162
00:04:19,601 --> 00:04:20,470
That's enough in my,

163
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,580
they looked at my dad and they go,

164
00:04:21,581 --> 00:04:22,990
we caught him fair and square.

165
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:24,070
And I was like,

166
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:25,310
oh my God,

167
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:26,350
this is private land.

168
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:27,310
It was like your land.

169
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:28,170
It was a lake.

170
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:29,190
There's a lake they were on,

171
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:29,861
they were on a boat.

172
00:04:29,861 --> 00:04:31,090
So it was a lake and the,

173
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,050
and it was an island that was like
maybe 10 feet off the shore of where our

174
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:35,670
house.

175
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:37,000
So it's a big lake.

176
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:37,920
It's a pretty big lake.

177
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,590
But yeah,

178
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:39,550
it's not all yours.

179
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:39,851
No,

180
00:04:39,851 --> 00:04:40,340
the whole lake.

181
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:41,173
It's not all ours,

182
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:42,030
but uh,

183
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:42,340
but,

184
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:44,620
and then the other side of
the lake was like North Tampa.

185
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:45,311
It was lutes,

186
00:04:45,311 --> 00:04:45,970
it's called lutes.

187
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:48,550
We got in the car that day and
then radio stations changed.

188
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:51,320
And I remember the song was downtown loop.

189
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:53,770
This is their intro to the song downtown.

190
00:04:53,771 --> 00:04:55,030
Lutes kick off your boots,

191
00:04:55,031 --> 00:04:56,860
give a Holler in a he hall.

192
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:58,630
And that was our new neighborhood.

193
00:04:58,660 --> 00:04:59,140
Wow.

194
00:04:59,140 --> 00:04:59,980
Jesus Christ.

195
00:04:59,981 --> 00:05:02,620
Why didn't your research it a little
before you fucking bought land there?

196
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:02,861
No,

197
00:05:02,861 --> 00:05:03,141
cause it was,

198
00:05:03,141 --> 00:05:04,060
it was a cheap property.

199
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:06,470
It's like

200
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:08,830
childhood.

201
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:09,491
I fucking know.

202
00:05:09,491 --> 00:05:10,660
Probably Hunt gators.

203
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:12,790
I think the whole state of Florida,

204
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:14,860
it's considered the south
side of the United States.

205
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:16,863
That's a good point.

206
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:18,890
[inaudible]

207
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,233
matter.

208
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,140
Turning the Dick in the country.

209
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:27,580
So when you look at like
losses like that and wins,

210
00:05:27,581 --> 00:05:31,090
does that make you play more
conservatively and upcoming
events or do you just

211
00:05:31,091 --> 00:05:32,080
have to play intelligently,

212
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:33,940
period and just take the
losses when they come?

213
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:34,990
Um,

214
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:39,100
the place where you get more conservative
is your bankroll management rather

215
00:05:39,101 --> 00:05:39,934
than your play.

216
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:44,290
The play from one hand to
the next is really about,

217
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:49,950
you have to put the magnitude of the
numbers out of your head and try to make

218
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:55,090
the best play each time it's
on you to make a decision.

219
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,170
So are you in the moment?

220
00:05:56,171 --> 00:06:00,500
Are you zen or you still thinking
about that $600,000 at you?

221
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,930
I'm pretty good at just
getting myself into the moment.

222
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,393
Um,

223
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:04,681
the,

224
00:06:04,681 --> 00:06:09,681
the place where you get more
conservative is you lose for awhile.

225
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,820
You have less money than you
did before that period started.

226
00:06:13,821 --> 00:06:14,900
You reevaluate.

227
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:19,400
I have only 75% of the money
I did a few months ago.

228
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,780
Should I maybe sell,

229
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:23,390
okay.

230
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:26,180
75% of my action in this upcoming
tournament instead of 50.

231
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:26,811
Right.

232
00:06:26,811 --> 00:06:27,171
I say,

233
00:06:27,171 --> 00:06:28,390
I say that,

234
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:31,610
that that's the way in which you can
get more conservative if you're going

235
00:06:31,611 --> 00:06:34,040
through a losing stretch
is play for lower stage.

236
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:35,960
What's the biggest losing
stretch you've ever gone through?

237
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:38,530
MMM,

238
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,690
in dollar amount period.

239
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,553
Dar mounts.

240
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:43,500
Uh,

241
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,460
let's see.

242
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:47,970
I'll give you ever gone through like
a couple million dollars in a weekend.

243
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:49,340
MMM.

244
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,290
In Games where I didn't,

245
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:52,550
where I had told action,

246
00:06:52,551 --> 00:06:53,840
didn't have all of myself.

247
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:54,891
Yeah.

248
00:06:54,891 --> 00:06:55,790
I've lost,

249
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:03,040
I guess my biggest losing couple
of days was on the order of

250
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:07,960
50 million Hong Kong,

251
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:08,801
Hong Kong dollars,

252
00:07:08,801 --> 00:07:09,670
Hong Kong dollars,

253
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:10,533
which are bigger,

254
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:11,290
or let,

255
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:11,471
let,

256
00:07:11,471 --> 00:07:12,131
let last rather.

257
00:07:12,131 --> 00:07:13,270
So only like 6 million.

258
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:14,740
Oh my God,

259
00:07:14,741 --> 00:07:15,460
son.

260
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:18,550
Only 6 million u s dollars.

261
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:19,570
And personally I had,

262
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:30,100
okay.
