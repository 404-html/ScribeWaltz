1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:01,630
The Joe Rogan experience,

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:06,220
I don't need you to be my friend
Ross Broccoli was as comedians.

3
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:06,791
Great Name.

4
00:00:06,791 --> 00:00:07,330
Yeah.

5
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:08,163
He's just really.

6
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:08,861
Look this up.

7
00:00:08,861 --> 00:00:11,660
If you can rub the getaway carrot
top and make a salad shelf dot.

8
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:14,350
Is there another vegetable guy?

9
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:16,640
Mm,

10
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:18,461
I.

11
00:00:18,461 --> 00:00:18,671
Well,

12
00:00:18,671 --> 00:00:19,360
they call me.

13
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:20,250
They accidentally,

14
00:00:20,251 --> 00:00:20,570
uh,

15
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:22,060
at the faneuil hall comedy connection.

16
00:00:22,061 --> 00:00:24,280
A black woman called the club and she say,

17
00:00:24,281 --> 00:00:25,300
who on the show tonight?

18
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:26,883
She was from.

19
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:28,360
She was from the 18 hundreds.

20
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:29,381
And uh,

21
00:00:29,381 --> 00:00:29,951
and they said,

22
00:00:29,951 --> 00:00:30,161
well,

23
00:00:30,161 --> 00:00:31,150
it's Anthony Clark,

24
00:00:31,151 --> 00:00:32,950
Jackie Flynn and Greg Fitzsimmons.

25
00:00:32,951 --> 00:00:33,784
And a lady goes,

26
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:35,890
is Grapefruit Simmons the headliner?

27
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,540
That's a great call me grapefruits.

28
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:43,420
And is to this day all the comics
of Boston coming grapefruit.

29
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:46,240
Grapefruit Simmons
should've changed my name.

30
00:00:46,241 --> 00:00:46,950
Right?

31
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:48,130
That's a great name.

32
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:49,760
Like,

33
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:50,860
like emo Philips.

34
00:00:50,861 --> 00:00:51,910
I know that's not his real name.

35
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:53,103
It doesn't offend me.

36
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:54,670
Carrot top.

37
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:55,391
That's on his real name.

38
00:00:55,391 --> 00:00:56,890
Either Grapefruit Simmons.

39
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:57,610
Right.

40
00:00:57,610 --> 00:00:58,480
But look up Ross,

41
00:00:58,481 --> 00:01:01,420
Broccoli and a and chicken truck.

42
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:04,630
Maybe you could go out from
here on out as grape simmons.

43
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:05,650
Grapefruit Simmons,

44
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:07,810
the artist formerly known
as Greg Fitzsimmons.

45
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:09,640
I need something for
people to talk about it.

46
00:01:09,641 --> 00:01:10,870
That's the kind of shit.

47
00:01:10,871 --> 00:01:11,980
That's brilliant marketing.

48
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,240
If you're into that kind of thing,

49
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:17,620
just change your name every
15 years and have people,

50
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:18,161
you know,

51
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:19,630
I have to get the twitter account,

52
00:01:19,631 --> 00:01:20,440
change everything.

53
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,041
Grapefruit,

54
00:01:21,041 --> 00:01:21,874
cinnamon.

55
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,920
Greg and I started out probably
within like a week of each other.

56
00:01:24,921 --> 00:01:25,250
Yeah,

57
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:25,610
right.

58
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:25,940
Yup.

59
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:26,810
Back in Boston,

60
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:30,740
the old Boston stitches
a comedy community,

61
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:31,401
you know,

62
00:01:31,401 --> 00:01:32,690
and a dude,

63
00:01:32,691 --> 00:01:32,901
we,

64
00:01:32,901 --> 00:01:34,910
you and I have done
gone through the bucket.

65
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:37,070
We went to some crazy
gigs in the beginning.

66
00:01:37,071 --> 00:01:37,341
Man.

67
00:01:37,341 --> 00:01:39,440
We went through together.

68
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:41,950
We went through like the
darkest time for standups.

69
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,100
Well,

70
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:44,150
the early days.

71
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:44,591
Yeah,

72
00:01:44,591 --> 00:01:46,640
we went through our personal dark.

73
00:01:46,641 --> 00:01:49,030
It stays at the lightest time in comedy,

74
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:50,610
you know,

75
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:51,660
I mean we were,

76
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:56,770
I see young comics today
and my heartbreaks because
they got to scrounge up

77
00:01:56,771 --> 00:01:57,491
stage time.

78
00:01:57,491 --> 00:01:58,180
You and I,

79
00:01:58,180 --> 00:01:58,660
you know,

80
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:01,870
I would say what less than
a year into doing standup,

81
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:05,170
we were driving out and
making 50 bucks cash five,

82
00:02:05,171 --> 00:02:06,010
six nights a week.

83
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:06,380
It was,

84
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:06,651
for me,

85
00:02:06,651 --> 00:02:08,210
it was exactly one year.

86
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:13,211
I first got paid by normal of foe
to open up for Warren Mcdonald.

87
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,360
He can garden,

88
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:16,070
I don't know where it was with some bar.

89
00:02:16,071 --> 00:02:17,930
I was on a like an apple box,

90
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:20,870
like literally like standing
on an apple box doing comedy.

91
00:02:20,871 --> 00:02:24,800
You can't fucking move
and had a good time.

92
00:02:24,801 --> 00:02:28,100
And then the next time I lurked for
Lenny Clarke does a two times in a row.

93
00:02:28,101 --> 00:02:29,060
I got super lucky.

94
00:02:29,061 --> 00:02:30,830
Normally fall like gotten me here.

95
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:33,650
You shot up you motherfucker man.

96
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,150
It was like all of us were like,

97
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:36,590
there was this ascension.

98
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:37,453
You would go,

99
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,580
you'd wait in line to
get a spot on on comedy.

100
00:02:40,581 --> 00:02:42,470
Hell open mic night stitches,

101
00:02:42,471 --> 00:02:43,011
comedy club.

102
00:02:43,011 --> 00:02:43,844
George Mcdonald,

103
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:44,690
welcome to comedy.

104
00:02:44,691 --> 00:02:46,880
Hell where the jokes always die.

105
00:02:46,881 --> 00:02:48,500
That Cavita is this whole thing.

106
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:48,810
And,

107
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:50,450
and we ran out of booze.

108
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:52,520
Comedy Hell where you can fly,

109
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:57,550
fly as high as the lights on Broadway or
crash and burn and the fiery pit known

110
00:02:57,771 --> 00:02:58,940
only as comedy.

111
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,793
Hell.

112
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:00,970
And that was step one.

113
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:01,571
And then you.

114
00:03:01,571 --> 00:03:05,470
And then you would get like a guest spot
on a real show and then you would start

115
00:03:05,471 --> 00:03:06,340
to get these like,

116
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:06,620
you know,

117
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:11,620
25 to $50 Mc spots where you were driving
the headline or somewhere and you jump

118
00:03:11,831 --> 00:03:16,690
past all that shit because they would
send you out to feature and the headliners

119
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,420
couldn't follow you because you
were out of your fucking mind.

120
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:20,141
I mean,

121
00:03:20,141 --> 00:03:21,130
you were nuts.

122
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:21,851
And uh,

123
00:03:21,851 --> 00:03:22,960
and so they had to headline you.

124
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:26,410
So you started working like
the d rooms but headlining.

125
00:03:26,411 --> 00:03:26,501
Um,

126
00:03:26,501 --> 00:03:30,010
so you started to get an
hour together super fast.

127
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:30,830
Yeah.

128
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:32,530
I had to sink or swim.

129
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:37,420
Those times when the regular would make
agreements to steal each other's shit.

130
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:38,503
We were bombing.

131
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:41,081
Say,

132
00:03:41,081 --> 00:03:41,411
dude,

133
00:03:41,411 --> 00:03:44,080
you got my whole act pick up there.

134
00:03:44,081 --> 00:03:45,260
Feel free to just had.

135
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,890
He would come back to that
blow job jokes killed.

136
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:52,060
If you go back to people that you might
want to wait another three humble,

137
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:54,800
let,

138
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,480
let,

139
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,780
let the heat die out of that joke.

140
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:58,710
It was fun for us because we knew we.

141
00:03:58,780 --> 00:03:59,840
Neither one of us should.

142
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:03,650
There was a point in time where both of
us were doing like middling gigs and we

143
00:04:03,651 --> 00:04:05,030
really didn't have the time.

144
00:04:05,031 --> 00:04:07,340
We really didn't have
a real solid half hour.

145
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:09,140
So it's sometimes you just,

146
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:10,350
when you,

147
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:13,700
when you're a young comic and you
slip in the beginning of your set,

148
00:04:13,701 --> 00:04:16,180
like the odds of you pulling
yourself out of the firearm.

149
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:17,093
Oh yeah.

150
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:20,300
I remember one time I was having a good
set and I knocked over a drink and I

151
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:21,290
didn't address it.

152
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:22,491
There was,

153
00:04:22,491 --> 00:04:24,230
it was turned on me.

154
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:26,630
They smell blood.

155
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:27,980
They knew I was scared.

156
00:04:27,981 --> 00:04:28,430
They knew I was.

157
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:29,660
I was killing it.

158
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:30,410
Now

159
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:34,220
there it's all about their
uncomfort and you denied.

160
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:37,400
I remember being on this was probably the
cruelest thing anybody ever did to me.

161
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:38,263
What else on stage?

162
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:39,200
It was like,

163
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:39,560
you know,

164
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,820
half filled room back.

165
00:04:40,821 --> 00:04:43,550
It was always like the back of a Chinese
restaurant where they had a banquet

166
00:04:43,551 --> 00:04:48,551
room that they just put a microphone up
and call it a comedy night and I'm up

167
00:04:48,561 --> 00:04:51,440
there tanking it and I'm not
acknowledging that I'm tanking it.

168
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:54,350
And during one of the silences
that should've had laughed,

169
00:04:54,351 --> 00:04:55,670
rented after one of my jokes,

170
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,220
I heard this middle aged woman
whispered to her husband,

171
00:04:58,221 --> 00:05:00,290
I could hear a whisper and she just goes,

172
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,070
they'll pull best.

173
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:08,870
Oh,

174
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:10,190
worse than any heckle.

175
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,353
Oh

176
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,333
Geez.

177
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:19,220
It would be real hard when
we'd watch each other.

178
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:19,521
You know,

179
00:05:19,521 --> 00:05:22,250
your watch a friend eat
dick in the beginning too,

180
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,880
because you know how devastating you know,

181
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:26,690
there's some times where you know,

182
00:05:26,691 --> 00:05:29,960
this guy is not going to pull himself
out of this and he has 15 more minutes to

183
00:05:29,961 --> 00:05:30,794
go

184
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:32,901
watch them,

185
00:05:32,901 --> 00:05:34,340
slosh through it up there.

186
00:05:34,341 --> 00:05:35,270
Is there a way out of it?

187
00:05:35,271 --> 00:05:35,420
Do you.

188
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:36,320
What do you have to do?

189
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:36,531
Like,

190
00:05:36,531 --> 00:05:38,180
do you just have to stop?

191
00:05:38,181 --> 00:05:40,170
Or did he just materials?

192
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:41,280
That's where we come in.

193
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,390
That's where we'd steal a great job.

194
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:47,350
I knew that they were grenades that I had
in my waistband that were jealous that

195
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:50,550
they would just take the
fucking top off and lob it.

196
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:51,640
And you're back in the game.

197
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,031
Yeah.

198
00:05:52,031 --> 00:05:53,380
It's like we would help each other.

199
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:59,000
There was a time where I was headlining
where I no fucking business headline and

200
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:00,170
there was no way.

201
00:06:00,171 --> 00:06:04,220
I barely had 40 minutes and they were
letting me headline these rooms and I

202
00:06:04,221 --> 00:06:08,030
would have to stretch it all out and
if something went wrong it went wrong.

203
00:06:08,031 --> 00:06:08,760
Hard.

204
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:12,230
That's there's no better motivation to
creating new material than when you just.

205
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:16,160
Those shows happen and you just
fucking have to get to a work.

206
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:17,810
Like you need more weapons.

207
00:06:17,811 --> 00:06:18,111
Man.

208
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,490
You went on a weapons too quick,

209
00:06:19,491 --> 00:06:20,390
you're up there dying.

210
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:20,820
Well,

211
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:23,700
especially like you can do
the hour when it's going well,

212
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:26,490
you can take that one bit
and you can stretch it out,

213
00:06:26,491 --> 00:06:27,390
add shit to it.

214
00:06:27,391 --> 00:06:27,561
You're,

215
00:06:27,561 --> 00:06:27,801
you're,

216
00:06:27,801 --> 00:06:31,590
you're doing improvisational jazz and
that our fills out when they're not

217
00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:32,070
laughing,

218
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:33,930
all of a sudden it's like concentrate.

219
00:06:33,931 --> 00:06:38,400
Everything shrinks down and
now what you had as 35 minutes,

220
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,760
he just ripped through and
17 and now you're scared.

221
00:06:41,761 --> 00:06:45,550
So you're tense and then you got
nowhere to go except the crowd.

222
00:06:45,551 --> 00:06:46,860
So you start fucking with a craft.

223
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:47,791
They don't like you.

224
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:48,481
Now did that.

225
00:06:48,481 --> 00:06:48,691
They ended.

226
00:06:48,691 --> 00:06:49,524
They don't like you.

227
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:51,330
You're not making them comfortable,

228
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:55,470
so there's not like a nice
flow of energy and so yeah,

229
00:06:55,471 --> 00:06:57,240
the early can feel it.

230
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,620
And the thing about Boston is,

231
00:06:58,621 --> 00:07:00,280
and I think it was kind
of unique to a lot of,

232
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:00,660
uh,

233
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:01,491
common other companies,

234
00:07:01,491 --> 00:07:02,580
cities is it,

235
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:04,680
it is a punchline town.

236
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:05,970
It's Bam,

237
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,540
Bam,

238
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:07,021
Bam,

239
00:07:07,021 --> 00:07:07,440
Bam.

240
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:07,711
You know,

241
00:07:07,711 --> 00:07:09,690
they don't want to see something esoteric.

242
00:07:09,691 --> 00:07:11,220
They don't want to see a storyteller.

243
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:14,970
They want you to grab them and just
smack them around and then walk off stage

244
00:07:14,971 --> 00:07:15,840
with your hands in the air.

245
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:16,131
Well,

246
00:07:16,131 --> 00:07:16,330
there,

247
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:19,820
there were guys that were doing
it that we're so good at the best.

248
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:21,830
We came up with an error where,

249
00:07:21,831 --> 00:07:22,490
you know,

250
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:25,250
I've talked about this 100 times on
the podcast and people always go,

251
00:07:25,251 --> 00:07:25,511
yeah,

252
00:07:25,511 --> 00:07:25,721
yeah,

253
00:07:25,721 --> 00:07:25,970
yeah.

254
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:26,331
We know.

255
00:07:26,331 --> 00:07:27,680
They were really good comedians back then.

256
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,960
I don't think people
even understand what a,

257
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:30,980
what a.

258
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:32,330
It was like a utopia.

259
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:35,090
Boston was like this
standup comedy utopia.

260
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,530
There was one point in time,

261
00:07:36,531 --> 00:07:39,320
there was five clubs
in a tiny little area,

262
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:40,720
seven nights a week club.

263
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:41,860
I,

264
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:44,640
there was just that one
block of warranty warranty.

265
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:48,340
It was nick's comedy stop and then there
was duck soup and there was a common

266
00:07:48,341 --> 00:07:49,660
connection and then Mike,

267
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:53,700
Mike Clark had the comedy club and the
Charles playhouse above the company.

268
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,990
And then on the weekends you
cut over to Dick dirties,

269
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:56,843
comedy vault,

270
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,000
50 yards away,

271
00:07:58,130 --> 00:07:58,963
craziness.

272
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,340
And then you get in your car.

273
00:08:00,341 --> 00:08:02,090
He drove down the stitches on common APP.

274
00:08:02,091 --> 00:08:03,190
It's like Holy Shit.

275
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:04,840
And the best part really was,

276
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:05,210
um,

277
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:06,400
and those were for short sets.

278
00:08:06,401 --> 00:08:07,170
You doing five,

279
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:08,710
seven minutes with a big clubs.

280
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:09,521
Those were the big ones.

281
00:08:09,521 --> 00:08:10,750
But then you and I would get,

282
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:12,640
and this is the thing
people don't get today,

283
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:14,590
is that we would get it for a year.

284
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:16,480
We get either you get my car,

285
00:08:16,481 --> 00:08:17,051
I get in yours.

286
00:08:17,051 --> 00:08:19,660
We draft providence one night for a 15,

287
00:08:19,661 --> 00:08:21,790
20 minute set for free all the time.

288
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,080
Then we go to Hartford one night,

289
00:08:23,081 --> 00:08:24,370
then we'd go to worcester one night,

290
00:08:24,371 --> 00:08:27,370
then we go to Maine one
night we would go anywhere.

291
00:08:27,371 --> 00:08:29,170
They'd give especially a longer set.

292
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:30,131
And then,

293
00:08:30,131 --> 00:08:30,371
you know,

294
00:08:30,371 --> 00:08:34,360
we were lucky enough to come up in a
time where the word comedy in front of a

295
00:08:34,361 --> 00:08:35,890
place drew a crowd.

296
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:38,140
You didn't need to have a big name.

297
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,880
They just were comedy crazy and we just
happened to be dropped in the middle of

298
00:08:42,881 --> 00:08:45,880
it in a city that was a closed system.

299
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:48,130
They didn't have headliners
come in from out of town.

300
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:49,300
So the local,

301
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:54,170
there were four or five big
local headliners that drew
and the and the and the

302
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:56,490
club's otherwise only booked based on.

303
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,630
Do you crush?

304
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,471
Are you funny?

305
00:08:58,471 --> 00:08:59,430
Are you original?

306
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,900
So it was a meritocracy.

307
00:09:00,901 --> 00:09:01,510
Yeah.

308
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:03,730
And no one ever thought they
were going to get famous.

309
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:05,230
What career?

310
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:06,820
If someone used the word career,

311
00:09:06,821 --> 00:09:08,200
people would have looked at them confused.

312
00:09:08,201 --> 00:09:08,351
Like,

313
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:09,184
what are you talking about?

314
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:12,820
All anyone wanted to do was
become a big Boston comic.

315
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:17,270
It's like the fame that you wanted was
just the being accepted amongst your

316
00:09:17,271 --> 00:09:18,770
peers and having crowds coming to see you.

317
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:19,720
That's it.

318
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,170
That's what everybody expect to see you,

319
00:09:21,171 --> 00:09:22,580
I think wasn't until later.

320
00:09:22,581 --> 00:09:23,960
I think for us it was just,

321
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:25,303
I can't.

322
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:25,761
It's like,

323
00:09:25,761 --> 00:09:29,720
you know when your first fucking a girl
and you can't believe she's letting you

324
00:09:29,721 --> 00:09:32,270
fuck her after jerking off
for three straight years.

325
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:34,910
That's what it was like when
I was doing standup in Boston.

326
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:40,150
They're allowing me these stages that
I've watched since I was a teenager in all

327
00:09:40,251 --> 00:09:40,670
this.

328
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:42,740
I'm on it and they're letting me talk.

329
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,633
That was it.

330
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:44,623
That's all I needed.

331
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:45,271
You know,

332
00:09:45,271 --> 00:09:49,020
one of the first guys I ever saw
do a live set was tom cotter.

333
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,270
Tom Cod is one of the first guys.

334
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:56,340
He's a buddy from Boston is a great
guy and he was in like some sort of a.

335
00:09:56,821 --> 00:10:01,140
The first time I ever went on some sort
of an open mic night and he was like the

336
00:10:01,141 --> 00:10:02,670
first guy that ever went on stage.

337
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:04,050
I remember that.

338
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,040
I swear to God,

339
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:05,551
same thing.

340
00:10:05,551 --> 00:10:06,420
He was like a not,

341
00:10:06,421 --> 00:10:08,970
he had started maybe
two years ahead of us.

342
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:09,893
That guy,

343
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:13,380
he always used to bum me out
and the reason we used to
bum me out because he was

344
00:10:13,381 --> 00:10:15,930
so fucking funny to hang out with,

345
00:10:15,931 --> 00:10:20,310
but he wanted to take it down
a notch and he wanted to like,

346
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:20,880
oh,

347
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,220
maybe,

348
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,650
maybe I shouldn't go so dirty.

349
00:10:22,651 --> 00:10:23,380
Maybe I should.

350
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:24,270
And you wanted to go do.

351
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:24,781
That's you.

352
00:10:24,781 --> 00:10:25,710
When you're at your best,

353
00:10:25,711 --> 00:10:26,580
you're a pervert.

354
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:28,760
They twist the crazy twisted.

355
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:33,140
He is one of the most twisted
dudes and I don't want to.

356
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:34,550
I'd rather have him on.

357
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:37,550
We should have him on and do it
together because his stories,

358
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,410
the shit that he would do,

359
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:40,190
I,

360
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:41,023
I can't,

361
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:42,470
I can't say it on the air,

362
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,030
what I can say anything on the air,

363
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:46,100
but the Shit Tom cotter did,

364
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,650
it was what the first guys I know that
would walk around with his balls hanging

365
00:10:49,651 --> 00:10:50,484
out of his pants.

366
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:53,820
One of the first guys like no one
was doing that back when we were 20.

367
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:55,560
We were like 21 or
whatever the hell we were.

368
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:58,080
And Tom Clark was walking around with
his balls hanging out with his parents

369
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:58,321
were like,

370
00:10:58,321 --> 00:10:59,930
Jesus Christmas

371
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:03,410
party and all the comics are there and
he and he would have the hands on his

372
00:11:03,411 --> 00:11:04,190
hips still.

373
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:05,030
It wasn't like he was hiding.

374
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:05,850
Oh No.

375
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:10,280
And I remember at one point we were at
somebody's house and there was a dog.

376
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:12,320
It was a oliver's dog and it was a,

377
00:11:12,321 --> 00:11:14,750
he had rescued one of those grey hounds.

378
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,340
I think Tom was putting a dill pickle
up its ass in the middle of the party.

379
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:21,500
Like we were both beyond children.

380
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:26,090
We were like fucking really
good collection of bad kid.

381
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:30,520
It was the part of the fun of
having a guy like Tom cotter too,

382
00:11:30,521 --> 00:11:32,880
is because you knew that he
would do something like that.

383
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:34,500
You knew he would want up things.

384
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:36,830
You knew if there was a bunch
of comics hanging around,

385
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:39,030
Carter would find a way to
make something fucked up.

386
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,240
But I always felt like he kind
of pulled back on stage though,

387
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:43,000
you know.

388
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:43,090
Well,

389
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:43,361
he,

390
00:11:43,361 --> 00:11:43,601
yeah,

391
00:11:43,601 --> 00:11:44,260
he um,

392
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:48,160
in terms of practical jokes and
like guys like Kevin Knox May,

393
00:11:48,161 --> 00:11:53,161
he rest in peace was one of those guys
just so fucking funny offstage and so me

394
00:11:53,591 --> 00:11:58,450
cotter and Nazi or working at a place in
Maine called the laughing lobster which

395
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:03,280
started to slow business and suddenly
burnt down in the middle of a wet summer.

396
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:05,560
And so we're up there and we're staying.

397
00:12:05,561 --> 00:12:09,340
There's a condo complex that we're staying
in which was pretty upscale and they

398
00:12:09,341 --> 00:12:12,550
got a pool and I was always hot fucking
chicks from Montreal to come down to

399
00:12:12,551 --> 00:12:14,220
that part of Maine.

400
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:15,520
So we go,

401
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,530
we're going to go down to the pool
and I don't have my bathing suit.

402
00:12:17,531 --> 00:12:17,831
And they're like,

403
00:12:17,831 --> 00:12:18,221
fuck it,

404
00:12:18,221 --> 00:12:19,390
you've got boxer shorts.

405
00:12:19,391 --> 00:12:20,650
She was wearing boxer shorts down.

406
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,380
So they head down and I
walked down to the pool.

407
00:12:23,381 --> 00:12:25,930
I opened the gate and I walk in and it's
packed and there on the far end of the

408
00:12:25,931 --> 00:12:29,500
pool and I make it about halfway down
the pool and they both stand up and start

409
00:12:29,501 --> 00:12:30,010
screaming.

410
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:30,790
Greg,

411
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:32,830
what are you doing in your underwear?

412
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:33,893
The whole fuck

413
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:38,140
red faced the

414
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:46,820
set me up the whole,

415
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:48,171
well,

416
00:12:48,171 --> 00:12:49,160
what's the pot laws?

417
00:12:49,161 --> 00:12:50,750
Are you allowed to smoke pot street?

418
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:53,180
Can you spoke here in your studio?

419
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:54,620
Allegedly,

420
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:55,910
this is what's going on with pot.

421
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:59,950
Pot is decriminalized and with
decriminalized does not mean legal.

422
00:12:59,951 --> 00:13:03,020
So in California it's
decriminalized in Colorado.

423
00:13:03,021 --> 00:13:03,854
It's legal.

424
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,900
In Colorado you can just smoke weed,

425
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:10,280
but they were trying to institute
a law in Colorado where they would.

426
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:14,600
They would bring out these sensors
and they would have these things.

427
00:13:14,601 --> 00:13:15,650
They attach their nose,

428
00:13:15,651 --> 00:13:16,670
they look preposterous.

429
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:21,530
It looked like something from a Dr Seuss
book come to life and it's this thing

430
00:13:21,531 --> 00:13:25,760
that literally goes over your nose and
looks like a bullhorn and they would

431
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:30,800
sniff through it and if they could
detect x parts per million of marijuana

432
00:13:30,801 --> 00:13:32,240
outside of your residence,

433
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:33,253
they could go and arrest.

434
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:34,150
You were fine.

435
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:34,451
Right?

436
00:13:34,451 --> 00:13:35,284
I heard about that.

437
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:35,660
They,

438
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:36,440
everybody was.

439
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:39,590
Everybody was so negative against it
that I'm pretty sure that they dropped it

440
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:41,420
because people are so angry.

441
00:13:41,421 --> 00:13:42,290
Like how stupid.

442
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:42,710
That was.

443
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:43,491
Very 19,

444
00:13:43,491 --> 00:13:44,324
84.

445
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:45,020
Not only that

446
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:46,590
gives people the ability to stand outside.

447
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:47,640
You know what it is,

448
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:52,640
it's people that were for the longest
time enforcing a policy that's not,

449
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:54,510
it's not valid anymore.

450
00:13:54,511 --> 00:13:56,940
There's the things that
guys knows that Shit's real.

451
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:57,953
A

452
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:01,680
type asshole.

453
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:04,670
He's already frowning mean well,

454
00:14:04,671 --> 00:14:05,181
that guy needs,

455
00:14:05,181 --> 00:14:08,300
we'd more than anybody
put a smile on his face.

456
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:09,860
Which silly bitch.

457
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:10,661
But um,

458
00:14:10,661 --> 00:14:10,810
yeah,

459
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:14,480
I was just in Colorado and I didn't get
a chance to read a couple of the comics

460
00:14:14,481 --> 00:14:15,021
I talked to.

461
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:18,050
One of them isn't even doing comedy
much because he's doing pot tours.

462
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:20,780
So in everybody's doing
now for money in Colorado,

463
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,490
they just do comedy of pop shops.

464
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:22,761
No,

465
00:14:22,761 --> 00:14:23,001
no.

466
00:14:23,001 --> 00:14:23,960
The Pot tour tours.

467
00:14:23,961 --> 00:14:28,100
People come into Colorado
today when you drive around.

468
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:30,560
I don't think that they
can technically buy it.

469
00:14:30,561 --> 00:14:33,350
I think you need a Colorado
license to buy it in the shops,

470
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:36,560
but you can walk through the shop
and smell it and then buy it for you.

471
00:14:36,561 --> 00:14:39,950
And then they go out and smoke it and
it's like a whole tour and they make.

472
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:41,540
They're making fucking tons of money.

473
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:42,451
Wow,

474
00:14:42,451 --> 00:14:43,320
that's interesting.

475
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:43,611
So they,

476
00:14:43,611 --> 00:14:46,590
they probably have material that
they do just for the pot tours.

477
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:46,941
Oh,

478
00:14:46,941 --> 00:14:47,630
I'm sure there.

479
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:48,463
Yeah.

480
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:48,801
Yeah.

481
00:14:48,801 --> 00:14:50,780
They probably have a bunch of corny jokes,

482
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:52,340
but they said it's great for the economy.

483
00:14:52,341 --> 00:14:53,570
Pay everybody's making money.

484
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:53,831
Oh,

485
00:14:53,831 --> 00:14:57,910
it's unbelievable for the economy and
that's what that fat fuck from New Jersey.

486
00:14:57,911 --> 00:14:58,744
That dummy,

487
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,010
that governor Chris Christie,

488
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,330
that fucking silly cunt.

489
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:02,081
He was like,

490
00:15:02,081 --> 00:15:04,120
it'll never be there on my watch.

491
00:15:04,121 --> 00:15:04,461
Yeah.

492
00:15:04,461 --> 00:15:04,661
Yeah.

493
00:15:04,661 --> 00:15:09,661
And he cites some unbelievably
unscientific study that
came out of some major

494
00:15:10,511 --> 00:15:11,111
university,

495
00:15:11,111 --> 00:15:12,940
which is foundation.

496
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:14,350
I don't know what the study was,

497
00:15:14,351 --> 00:15:17,320
but it was about
abnormalities and marijuana.

498
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:19,150
The abnormalities in the brain.

499
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:20,740
What does that mean?

500
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:21,010
Well,

501
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:21,850
here's what it means.

502
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:23,110
What's normal?

503
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:24,203
Okay.

504
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:28,930
It just because something has a certain
content in it or your mind reacts a

505
00:15:28,931 --> 00:15:31,600
certain way without a drug,

506
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:33,650
with the idea that the,

507
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:34,960
that it changing,

508
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:35,950
being bad,

509
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:39,580
you would have to demonstrate that there's
something wrong with the people that

510
00:15:39,581 --> 00:15:40,414
it's changing.

511
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:41,111
Like what do you.

512
00:15:41,111 --> 00:15:44,560
What are you demonstrating that shows
that this abnormality is in any way

513
00:15:44,561 --> 00:15:45,394
detrimental?

514
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:46,363
What are you showing?

515
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:48,610
Like where are all these
people are smoking pot.

516
00:15:48,611 --> 00:15:52,030
That of becoming shaking messes were
all these people that are smoking pot.

517
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:57,300
Millions upon millions upon millions of
people are smoking pot on a daily basis.

518
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,620
Why is everybody,

519
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:00,850
are they falling apart?

520
00:16:00,851 --> 00:16:02,160
Is everyone losing their job?

521
00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:03,400
But they forgetting how to drive?

522
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,750
Are they looking at their phone going,

523
00:16:04,751 --> 00:16:05,740
what the fuck is this?

524
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:06,161
You know,

525
00:16:06,161 --> 00:16:07,150
this is not happening.

526
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:09,580
Like you're not demonstrating
any negative effects.

527
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,790
You're saying the studies
shows a negative effect.

528
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:13,091
No,

529
00:16:13,091 --> 00:16:13,610
it doesn't.

530
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:14,760
Study shows a chain.

531
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:17,460
She can commission a study
to say anything you want.

532
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:17,661
Well,

533
00:16:17,661 --> 00:16:18,510
when you look at the word,

534
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:20,390
the language in that study,

535
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:22,640
it's not scientific at all.

536
00:16:22,641 --> 00:16:26,540
The language is creepy because the
language says in one of the quotes,

537
00:16:26,541 --> 00:16:27,530
I'm paraphrasing,

538
00:16:27,531 --> 00:16:31,460
it was something along the lines of people
that think that smoking pot even on a

539
00:16:31,461 --> 00:16:33,010
casual basis is,

540
00:16:33,011 --> 00:16:33,844
is fine.

541
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:36,350
This study is showing
that it's not good at all.

542
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:39,020
Like you can't say not good
at all because you're not.

543
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,090
You're not demonstrating not good.

544
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:42,860
What you're demonstrating is a change.

545
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:46,610
Guess what else changes your personality,

546
00:16:46,611 --> 00:16:47,720
your creativity,

547
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,190
your compassion sex,

548
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,830
your sensitivity to sexual intercourse,

549
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:54,020
you the way food tastes in your mouth,

550
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:54,831
your way,

551
00:16:54,831 --> 00:16:55,980
you view other people,

552
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:56,370
bull,

553
00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:58,200
you're going down.

554
00:16:58,201 --> 00:16:59,640
There's a lot of things going on.

555
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:04,380
These and these are the same people that
will disagree with 98 percent of the

556
00:17:04,381 --> 00:17:08,760
scientists around the world
who say there's climate
change that are hard studies

557
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:11,100
with real numbers that are scientific.

558
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:11,431
Well,

559
00:17:11,431 --> 00:17:12,390
this Chris Christie guys,

560
00:17:12,391 --> 00:17:13,171
fat as fuck,

561
00:17:13,171 --> 00:17:15,600
which is one of the worst things you
could be as a person if you want to be

562
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:16,080
healthy,

563
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,400
shows a lack of character.

564
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:17,910
It does.

565
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:19,200
It shows a lack of willpower.

566
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:20,300
It shows a lack of focus,

567
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:20,650
goodson,

568
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:21,440
determination.

569
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,280
You look what do you,

570
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:26,060
how do you view life and you're
going around in a sloppy meat wagon.

571
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:27,321
That's what you are.

572
00:17:27,321 --> 00:17:27,541
You're,

573
00:17:27,541 --> 00:17:28,610
you're not an athlete.

574
00:17:28,611 --> 00:17:29,444
You're not someone who,

575
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:33,410
if you had a choice between being a person
who respects their body and treats it

576
00:17:33,411 --> 00:17:34,010
well,

577
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:37,850
or being a person that treats their
body like a fucking big Mac dumpster,

578
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:39,420
what's your choice?

579
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,920
What you went with big Mac dumpster?

580
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:41,161
Well,

581
00:17:41,161 --> 00:17:41,701
guess what,

582
00:17:41,701 --> 00:17:44,400
you don't get to lead
because you're not a leader.

583
00:17:44,401 --> 00:17:47,130
You don't get to decide what's
healthy when you're walking around.

584
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:48,860
Like literally represented.

585
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:50,130
We going to have a heart attack.

586
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:50,600
Know,

587
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,680
I think there was a
study that showed that,

588
00:17:52,681 --> 00:17:52,950
uh,

589
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:55,350
people wouldn't vote for him because
they'd be afraid that he would die in

590
00:17:55,351 --> 00:17:55,711
office,

591
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:56,360
have a harvest.

592
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,460
He could die of sleep apnea for sure.

593
00:17:58,461 --> 00:17:59,360
He has sleep apnea.

594
00:17:59,361 --> 00:18:00,171
When you were that fat,

595
00:18:00,171 --> 00:18:01,010
you have sleep apnea.

596
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:01,730
Yeah,

597
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:02,570
he probably snores.

598
00:18:02,571 --> 00:18:03,380
Like how?

599
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:05,430
I don't know if he sleeps
the seat CPAP machine.

600
00:18:05,431 --> 00:18:05,901
If he doesn't,

601
00:18:05,901 --> 00:18:06,560
he should.

602
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,730
There's a lot of shit going on.

603
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:08,580
That guy's proud.

604
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:09,820
They got on diapers,

605
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:11,060
a seat pack machine.

606
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,260
He's got a big Mac.

607
00:18:12,261 --> 00:18:13,094
Next pets.

608
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,890
Well there's a diaper
that they're selling now.

609
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:16,671
Tony told me,

610
00:18:16,671 --> 00:18:18,010
Tara Gousha froze.

611
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:21,530
A lot of times a menu you could
get a little drippage is a tampon.

612
00:18:21,531 --> 00:18:24,710
The were at the front of your diaper
because you're decleor and they're trying

613
00:18:24,711 --> 00:18:26,480
to sell it as like a normal thing.

614
00:18:26,481 --> 00:18:26,870
Yeah.

615
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:27,191
Meanwhile,

616
00:18:27,191 --> 00:18:29,570
it's this guy with this swollen,

617
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:34,620
inflamed gut filled with undigested food
and feces that hasn't been pushed out

618
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:37,370
yet.

619
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:42,280
Fat that permeates all the different
layers of his skin and yeah,

620
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:44,290
she's not a muscle left under there.

621
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:46,410
Then the muscles are all gone.

622
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:51,070
I'm going to throw you my broken
Thai in my because Lincoln,

623
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:51,931
trust me.

624
00:18:51,931 --> 00:18:53,700
Just wear a tampon and keep leading them.

625
00:18:53,701 --> 00:18:54,780
Fucking meatball subs.

626
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:59,900
Meatball meatballs balls inside.

627
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,690
They got Monica got they got.

628
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:07,140
They got the peppers they put
on the top 10 like my mother.

629
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,150
God bless her.

630
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:11,460
She died of a heart attack at 51.

631
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:16,920
He's the guy driving the truck
that beeped at my fucking God.

632
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:17,880
God had to make

633
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,540
my fucking pepper.

634
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:22,010
Got My meatballs.

635
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:26,070
I know and I walk my fat on my feet,

636
00:19:26,071 --> 00:19:28,230
spills over the outside of my sneakers.

637
00:19:28,231 --> 00:19:28,920
I like that.

638
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:29,260
Look.

639
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:31,710
I like a little waterfall
going into my heel.

640
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:33,140
I stepped down,

641
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:34,003
just

642
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,580
rolls over.

643
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:37,640
I liked,

644
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,480
I liked the last one

645
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:39,940
cause my fucking gun,

646
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:42,010
my gun sticking out my legs

647
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:43,930
the way the back of my head.

648
00:19:43,931 --> 00:19:44,764
Looks Dog,

649
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,270
the hot dog roll look.

650
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:50,320
Fat Sausages that have grown
out of the base of my skull,

651
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,000
it looks like it makes you
hungry for the fucking the

652
00:19:56,770 --> 00:19:57,603
sausage

653
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:00,670
face.

654
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:02,380
You see a wrinkle in my face.

655
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,690
You see any spider marks by my eyes?

656
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:05,501
Fuck no,

657
00:20:05,501 --> 00:20:09,160
because the flesh is pushing out
against the skin all the time.

658
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:10,080
It's pulled tight.

659
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:12,390
It makes me look young and vibrant.

660
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:14,430
Look at my Chin's fight.

661
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:15,720
All of them died.

662
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:18,570
I had a dude who told me that
that was William Shatner's.

663
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:20,130
Williamson has said this to him.

664
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:21,210
He said,

665
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:21,511
he goes,

666
00:20:21,511 --> 00:20:21,721
wow.

667
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:24,360
He was interviewing them and we're
shocked apparently is like 80 years old.

668
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:24,871
And he goes,

669
00:20:24,871 --> 00:20:25,704
you look great.

670
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:26,281
And he said,

671
00:20:26,281 --> 00:20:26,401
well,

672
00:20:26,401 --> 00:20:30,390
I realize that a certain year that
if I just put on five pounds a year,

673
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:33,900
I never get really wrinkly because
my face is like pushing fat out.

674
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:35,131
And he goes,

675
00:20:35,131 --> 00:20:35,964
I'm serious.

676
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:41,120
Like apparently like he was a strategy
to like to stay young looking but keeping

677
00:20:41,341 --> 00:20:42,174
your fake,

678
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:45,000
but I don't think you're supposed
to be that fat when you're 80.

679
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,710
I think that's like super bad for you.

680
00:20:46,711 --> 00:20:47,050
Right?

681
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:47,950
That's just bullshit.

682
00:20:47,951 --> 00:20:48,090
It

683
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:49,060
like because he's fat,

684
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:49,923
he's just made that shit.

685
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:50,590
Right.

686
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:51,820
He's working backwards.

687
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:52,930
But that is true.

688
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:54,430
If you will get older fat people,

689
00:20:54,431 --> 00:20:57,400
they look way better than fat
joggers or the older joggers.

690
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:57,581
No.

691
00:20:57,581 --> 00:21:01,510
I started running two years ago and I
lost weight in my face and now I look like

692
00:21:01,511 --> 00:21:02,710
a fucking skull.

693
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:03,710
I take my hat.

694
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:04,750
I looked like a look at this.

695
00:21:04,751 --> 00:21:05,411
When I take my hat off,

696
00:21:05,411 --> 00:21:06,640
I looked like a light bulb.

697
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:07,360
There's no.

698
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,720
The light hits it and
they just look at it.

699
00:21:09,721 --> 00:21:13,720
I just all my face and sunken and you
liked it better when you have like a

700
00:21:13,721 --> 00:21:18,190
little plumpish I wasn't even plugged
but this is like a receipt and my Chin

701
00:21:18,191 --> 00:21:22,300
looks like it's sticking out and I
don't know how to put weight on my face.

702
00:21:22,301 --> 00:21:22,580
You know?

703
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:22,930
That's.

704
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:23,621
Once it's gone,

705
00:21:23,621 --> 00:21:25,240
it's gone dancing.

706
00:21:25,241 --> 00:21:26,530
I mean I'm telling you,

707
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,040
springsteen is,

708
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:30,280
is a fucking experience live.

709
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:33,700
I heard you two is but
a grateful dead concert.

710
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:35,170
I mean,

711
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:35,531
first of all,

712
00:21:35,531 --> 00:21:36,280
you're tripping.

713
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:38,080
Every single person is dancing,

714
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,300
not bouncing back and forth.

715
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:45,450
Fucking are doing the backstroke and
looking at the sky like that is really

716
00:21:45,521 --> 00:21:48,870
intense to be surrounded
by that for four hours.

717
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:50,650
So is that what it's all about?

718
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:51,150
Yeah.

719
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:53,500
It's this letting go into this energy.

720
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:54,483
Is it a.

721
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:56,620
is it a show that requires drugs?

722
00:21:57,430 --> 00:21:57,971
Yes.

723
00:21:57,971 --> 00:21:58,410
Yeah,

724
00:21:58,410 --> 00:21:58,900
yeah,

725
00:21:58,900 --> 00:21:59,400
it does.

726
00:21:59,400 --> 00:21:59,860
Yeah.

727
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:03,100
And is it a show that you don't understand
until you do it with drugs and then

728
00:22:03,101 --> 00:22:07,430
you understand it 100 percent like you
ever the worst feeling in the world?

729
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:09,910
Do you ever go to a concert like pipe?

730
00:22:09,911 --> 00:22:13,900
My wife me go to fucking
Dave Matthews band.

731
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:14,830
Oh God,

732
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:16,150
that's ugly.

733
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:18,790
And the wife made me go to is always bad.

734
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:20,381
But then when you say,

735
00:22:20,381 --> 00:22:23,980
I shouldn't say the only thing worse
than Dave Matthews is John Meyer,

736
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:29,800
John Mica and John Mayer
Meyer and she was just like,

737
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,320
just enthralled by him.

738
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:32,903
Huh?

739
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:33,341
I could do.

740
00:22:33,341 --> 00:22:34,630
John Mayer will know I can do to.

741
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:34,791
No,

742
00:22:34,791 --> 00:22:35,500
I think he's great.

743
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,400
I think he's very talented.

744
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:38,050
But if your wife is really into going,

745
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:39,041
what I'm saying,

746
00:22:39,041 --> 00:22:40,870
like she dragged you there
and just stares at him

747
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:44,470
and you're like,

748
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:45,303
I paid for this.

749
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:47,530
Paid to have your wife.

750
00:22:47,531 --> 00:22:48,670
Close her eyes later.

751
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,593
Think about him.

752
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:53,300
You notice she's not clapping because
one of her hand slipped down or james

753
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:55,740
knuckle deep.

754
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:02,200
She's clapping with one hand.

755
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,680
It sounds like something stabbing a seal.

756
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:12,040
It sounds like one of those martial arts
movies where they rip the guy's heart

757
00:23:12,041 --> 00:23:12,874
out after

758
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,980
she's just fist of herself.

759
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:19,570
She's all the way to your elbow.

760
00:23:19,571 --> 00:23:21,900
Just gritting their teeth
and pounded it in there.

761
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:22,960
Get the wedding ring off.

762
00:23:22,961 --> 00:23:24,940
She's just fucking strafing the.

763
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:28,520
You can see her rib cage
expand as a goes up there.

764
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:33,713
Fucking

765
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:38,021
okay,

766
00:23:38,021 --> 00:23:38,854
let's go.

767
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,260
Then you realize it's in her asshole.

768
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,500
You thought it was bad?

769
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:48,870
It's all fucking shit up to her elbow.

770
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:52,970
What is this the fuck are you doing?

771
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,350
I thought we're going to see a concert.

772
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:56,250
Just says licking her arm.

773
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:00,633
Oh John.

774
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:01,250
Oh,

775
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:02,560
you make me my shit.

776
00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:05,891
Meanwhile,

777
00:24:05,891 --> 00:24:07,840
that's not the craziest
person that ever lived.

778
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:08,580
Nope.

779
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:09,413
That's not even close.

780
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:09,820
Nope.

781
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:10,121
And you know,

782
00:24:10,121 --> 00:24:12,250
what's amazing is every podcast,

783
00:24:12,251 --> 00:24:15,580
no matter how long I ended up hanging out
with the guests for another 45 minutes

784
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,840
afterwards and you're like,

785
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:17,920
they don't want to leave here,

786
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:18,810
but I want to leave.

787
00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:19,870
And it could have just kept going.

788
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:20,621
Well,

789
00:24:20,621 --> 00:24:21,191
I do,

790
00:24:21,191 --> 00:24:22,420
I do to a point.

791
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:25,960
I always feel like a lot of times
because I do the serious show first,

792
00:24:25,961 --> 00:24:26,980
I've already given me an hour.

793
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:28,480
And then I usually
shoot a video with them.

794
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:30,250
I do this thing called
talk your way out of it,

795
00:24:30,251 --> 00:24:32,560
where I give people and on
I'll do it to you right now.

796
00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:34,510
I'm going to give you an
uncomfortable situation.

797
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:36,130
And then in a split second,

798
00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:39,250
you're going to have to talk your way
out of it as if you're talking to the

799
00:24:39,251 --> 00:24:39,790
person.

800
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:40,001
Okay?

801
00:24:40,001 --> 00:24:40,834
All right.

802
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:42,303
Um,

803
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:48,190
are you go to the doctor's off and
he's gonna he's gonna check you out.

804
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:49,080
So,

805
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:49,750
um,

806
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:52,180
he bends you over the
table and then you go,

807
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,420
oh,

808
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:54,400
I forgot the rubber gloves.

809
00:24:54,401 --> 00:24:55,234
He walks out.

810
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,160
You notice that the
medicine cabinets open,

811
00:24:57,161 --> 00:24:58,870
you reach and you find
a bottle of Vicodin.

812
00:24:59,050 --> 00:25:00,910
You see it as he's coming in,

813
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:01,900
he's going to bust you,

814
00:25:01,901 --> 00:25:02,680
you take it,

815
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,910
you stick it up your ass to hide it.

816
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:05,950
The doctor spreads her cheeks.

817
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:06,731
He wants to look at.

818
00:25:06,731 --> 00:25:09,520
You must look at your colon.

819
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:10,900
He puts his finger in.

820
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:14,690
He pulls out the bottle of Igon
and talk your way out of it.

821
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:15,591
Oh,

822
00:25:15,591 --> 00:25:16,490
that's where that was

823
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:20,703
word

824
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,473
by word.

825
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,100
It's all you're in the clear.

826
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:25,370
Oh,

827
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:26,203
that's where it is.

828
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:30,490
Thanking them thinking maybe,

829
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:31,993
but no.

830
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:35,360
Usually it takes like two minutes.

831
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,830
People talk around it.

832
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:39,620
They described you average five words.

833
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,480
Just go right for C'mon man.

834
00:25:41,481 --> 00:25:42,110
You can't.

835
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:45,290
You already busted wagner
and bottled up your ass.

836
00:25:45,291 --> 00:25:45,960
You're a freak.

837
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:46,793
I did that.

838
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:47,761
I did that too.

839
00:25:47,761 --> 00:25:48,900
Not that particular one.

840
00:25:48,901 --> 00:25:52,290
I thought I was [inaudible] my last show
was with Natasha and I did that to her,

841
00:25:52,291 --> 00:25:55,530
but it was in her pussy and she had
her feet in the stirrups and she goes,

842
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:55,981
oh,

843
00:25:55,981 --> 00:25:57,390
I was just tightening that for you.

844
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,790
Oh yeah,

845
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:03,803
yeah.

846
00:26:03,810 --> 00:26:04,643
But um,

847
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:05,221
yeah.

848
00:26:05,221 --> 00:26:06,054
So,

849
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:06,973
um,

850
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:08,671
fuck,

851
00:26:08,671 --> 00:26:09,504
this is great.

852
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:10,381
This is great.

853
00:26:10,381 --> 00:26:11,550
I just forgot we were talking about it.

854
00:26:11,551 --> 00:26:12,150
It doesn't matter.
