1
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:04,650
Hello Freak bitches,
not I recently that,

2
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:05,390
you know,
these,

3
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:09,580
the people that want to,
to fight and then he got lost me Phi and

4
00:00:09,581 --> 00:00:10,414
Blah Blah Blah.
And then you find out what they did 

5
00:00:11,441 --> 00:00:13,960
until the runup or what did you do?
Oh,

6
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:15,700
I got drunk,
let's see,

7
00:00:15,701 --> 00:00:16,534
weeks before hello.
What a fucking surprise if you will not 

8
00:00:19,031 --> 00:00:20,770
live in it.
And if you're not,

9
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:21,590
you know,
getting,

10
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:22,423
you know,
you know,

11
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:23,433
really immersing yourself and in every 
way in the language that you speak to 

12
00:00:25,631 --> 00:00:27,910
yourself and in the way that you do 
everything else.

13
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:32,140
Once you expect your mind's not going to
support you if you don't support it.

14
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:33,653
Yeah.
That was one of the things that I felt 

15
00:00:34,771 --> 00:00:35,604
when Jon Jones tested positive for 
cocaine three weeks out of his fight 

16
00:00:38,551 --> 00:00:39,720
with Daniel Cormier,
I was like,

17
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:42,470
Ooh.
Like he's not even other.

18
00:00:42,471 --> 00:00:44,430
I look,
I only was anything wrong with doing,

19
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,130
I don't know if there's anything wrong 
with doing cocaine.

20
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,870
I just,
I don't think it's a positive drug,

21
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:51,010
but some people enjoy it.
Um,

22
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:53,100
some people enjoy drinking.
I enjoy drinking.

23
00:00:53,101 --> 00:00:55,170
I don't think that's positive drug 
necessarily either.

24
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:56,213
So,
I don't know cause I don't have 

25
00:00:56,491 --> 00:00:59,460
experience with cocaine,
but that's not something you're supposed

26
00:00:59,461 --> 00:01:00,294
to be doing three weeks outside of a 
world title fight with one of the best 

27
00:01:02,521 --> 00:01:03,354
wrestlers in the sport.
One of the most difficult challenges 

28
00:01:06,211 --> 00:01:10,350
you've ever faced in your professional 
career and you're out doing blow just 21

29
00:01:10,351 --> 00:01:11,690
days before.
That's crazy.

30
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:12,613
Yeah.
Sometimes the most talented take the 

31
00:01:14,211 --> 00:01:17,630
gifts that they've been given and just 
abused them in a way.

32
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:20,240
I met Jon Jones.
He's um,

33
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:23,090
it's different to say the least.
And what,

34
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:28,070
where he was,
I didn't know he was,

35
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:30,350
it was kind of,
I only met him briefly.

36
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:35,880
Why was it I made him in Russia,
the legend that is a show there and a,

37
00:01:36,771 --> 00:01:37,604
yeah,
he was just,

38
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:39,830
he was very sort of,
it was all over the place,

39
00:01:39,831 --> 00:01:40,664
bouncing around and I just,
I just didn't expect him to be like 

40
00:01:43,401 --> 00:01:43,970
that.
Expect.

41
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:45,650
And what do you mean by all over the 
place bounds?

42
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,450
It just,
he just said to me,

43
00:01:47,451 --> 00:01:49,460
Hi blue eyes and was like,
hello,

44
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:54,140
he's my from dangerous and I'm not.
I was like,

45
00:01:54,141 --> 00:01:56,900
hi.
I just found it a bit strange.

46
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:00,860
Maybe I read into with you.
I just found him different.

47
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:04,460
Let's just say that I just found him 
different and I,

48
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,630
I'm trying to read into this.
I,

49
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:10,890
and I'm trying to avoid it badly.
He,

50
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:13,280
I don't know him.
I met,

51
00:02:13,281 --> 00:02:14,300
he was,
it was different.

52
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:15,440
Let's put it that way,
you know?

53
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:17,030
But um,
if,

54
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,370
if they,
if someone,

55
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:20,533
I don't know,
you don't know what's going on in his 

56
00:02:21,291 --> 00:02:22,124
life and you know,
you don't know what's going on in his 

57
00:02:23,901 --> 00:02:25,360
life and you could say that about 
everyone.

58
00:02:25,361 --> 00:02:26,930
He could say that about a serial killer,
couldn't ya?

59
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,630
But we do know what's going in his life.
It's not as full,

60
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:30,591
you know,
really.

61
00:02:30,591 --> 00:02:31,424
I mean,
there is some things that you shouldn't 

62
00:02:32,091 --> 00:02:33,320
do and you know,
he shouldn't be doing it.

63
00:02:33,321 --> 00:02:34,770
But these reasons,

64
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,833
if you listen to John's coaches,
they will tell you that John Surrounds 

65
00:02:38,841 --> 00:02:43,841
himself with the wrong people.
And John is an extremely talented guy.

66
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:48,050
Amazing.
It's like maybe one of the most talented

67
00:02:48,051 --> 00:02:52,670
guys to ever compete in the sport and 
incredibly strong mentally too.

68
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:53,863
Because despite all of his issues with 
maybe not preparing as well as he could 

69
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,560
when the chips are down,
that guy gets through things.

70
00:03:02,561 --> 00:03:04,450
He overcomes adversity.
He's not a front runner.

71
00:03:04,451 --> 00:03:06,160
He's the one that broke his toe,
isn't a,

72
00:03:06,161 --> 00:03:07,930
that was terrific.
So he's gone,

73
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:11,380
but he didn't even realize that was 
happening that that happened actually in

74
00:03:11,381 --> 00:03:15,520
the final flurry where he stopped chill 
son and a more impressive performance is

75
00:03:15,521 --> 00:03:16,354
when he fought vitor Belfort,
Vito or completely hyper extended his 

76
00:03:19,721 --> 00:03:21,880
arm and he would not tap,
you know,

77
00:03:21,881 --> 00:03:24,160
it was for his title Vi tour came that 
close.

78
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:25,330
Was it for the title?

79
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:27,370
I believe it was.
It might've been non title fight,

80
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:31,210
but [inaudible] came find out if that 
was a title fight or non title fight.

81
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:36,240
Either way [inaudible] came that close 
to legitimately beating John Jones.

82
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,073
That clothes got a lot fully locked in 
Armbar that would have made 90% of the 

83
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:44,350
professional fighters in the world tap.
Well that's what makes him who he is.

84
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,593
But he,
but he couldn't say notice it was a 

85
00:03:47,141 --> 00:03:47,974
title fight.
Yeah.

86
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:50,810
Jamie just looked at him.
He couldn't say no to some blow.

87
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:52,580
Well he could say no,
he want it.

88
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:56,790
Didn't want us to get some sort of,
I don't know of any,

89
00:03:56,791 --> 00:03:58,380
his weakness,
I don't know these people,

90
00:03:58,381 --> 00:03:59,214
there's some sort of weakness,
weakness or don't know if it is 

91
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:03,720
deliberate,
it's not.

92
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,140
He shouldn't be something you should be 
doing.

93
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:10,480
It's also indulgence.
It's like he likes to party,

94
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:11,763
you know,
but then there's isn't there also the 

95
00:04:12,881 --> 00:04:13,714
issue that fighters in particular,
especially guys that are about a lot of 

96
00:04:18,431 --> 00:04:20,920
hard gym sessions and a lot of hard 
fights,

97
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:25,690
they have impulse control problems and 
those impulse control problems.

98
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:28,000
I'm obviously not a scientist or a 
doctor,

99
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:31,180
but when you talk to neurologists and 
neuroscientists,

100
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:32,373
they will tell you that there are direct
correlations between head impacts and 

101
00:04:36,371 --> 00:04:37,630
poor impulse control.
Right.

102
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,540
It is absolutely a direct impact.
And I,

103
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:41,403
you know,
not looking for a scapegoat in my own 

104
00:04:43,271 --> 00:04:46,450
life,
but I've looked back at some of the poor

105
00:04:46,451 --> 00:04:48,370
decision making that I've done in my 
life,

106
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:52,480
particularly in my fighting times,
like back then and I was like,

107
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:54,850
I wonder if a lot of that was getting 
hit in the head a lot.

108
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,253
Like,
like it can't be good to get kicked in 

109
00:04:59,171 --> 00:05:00,760
the head.
It's just never good.

110
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:02,620
Not In the past,
just not good.

111
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,250
And so if you've been kicked in the head
or punched in the face or whatever,

112
00:05:06,251 --> 00:05:07,480
you know,
any kind of impact.

113
00:05:07,481 --> 00:05:09,490
And that's the thing about football 
players,

114
00:05:09,491 --> 00:05:10,324
they're saying now is it even a shot to 
the chest even getting tackled like 

115
00:05:14,201 --> 00:05:17,170
someone rams at you and slams their 
shoulders into your chest.

116
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:20,080
The brain gets jostled around.
Yeah.

117
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:22,630
You might not have a bruise on your 
face,

118
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:27,010
but your brain is receiving essentially 
the same impact as a punch.

119
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:29,180
Yeah,
I was just kinda crazy.

120
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,070
You know,
people might not like,

121
00:05:33,071 --> 00:05:35,260
they split it as a shade that Jon Jones 
has gone.

122
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:36,730
Like,
you know what I mean?

123
00:05:36,731 --> 00:05:39,030
Cause he's got a lot back on him.
You know what I mean?

124
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,140
He's got to look back on him and they 
fuck,

125
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:42,413
you know,
he's also got to figure out what it is 

126
00:05:43,781 --> 00:05:45,040
that he took.
You know,

127
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:45,874
they,
they don't even exactly to have an 

128
00:05:46,991 --> 00:05:51,640
isolated what he took,
but the whole lifestyle,

129
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,460
it's,
it's cert most certainly an issue.

130
00:05:54,461 --> 00:05:55,294
And it's almost like one of those things
where you say you don't know what you 

131
00:05:57,531 --> 00:05:59,180
got until it's gone.
Well,

132
00:05:59,181 --> 00:06:02,150
it was kind of gone for a little while,
but not really.

133
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:06,110
He was always still in the mix and there
was always multimillion dollar fights,

134
00:06:06,111 --> 00:06:08,770
a waiting.
And then he fought over in saint proves.

135
00:06:08,771 --> 00:06:11,540
So he's back in the mix and everything's
looking good.

136
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:12,374
He's slated to fight at UFC 200 against 
Daniel cormier is gonna make like 10 

137
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,400
million bucks.
It's going to be giant.

138
00:06:19,401 --> 00:06:20,234
And then whoosh,
it's gone for something that if you 

139
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:28,841
talked to people that are experts in 
performance enhancing drugs,

140
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:32,000
they will tell you that this clomiphene 
is what he got popped for,

141
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:36,860
which is an anti estrogen supplement 
that's not even beneficial.

142
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:39,680
The only time that stuff's beneficial as
a set of,

143
00:06:39,681 --> 00:06:41,660
essentially when you're coming off of 
steroids,

144
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,560
but yet he didn't test positive for 
steroids before or after.

145
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,960
So it could have been a tainted 
supplement.

146
00:06:47,961 --> 00:06:49,850
It could have been a mistake.
It could have been,

147
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:53,000
who knows what wacky shit he was taken.
I mean,

148
00:06:53,001 --> 00:06:53,710
I don't know.

149
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:54,910
I just think that,
you know,

150
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:58,990
people forget that they locked sometimes
you've still got off guidance,

151
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:00,700
you know,
you still go,

152
00:07:00,701 --> 00:07:02,170
oh,
have a guide and you know,

153
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:03,130
to just say,
look,

154
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:05,650
is that the best thing you should be 
doing or someone to talk.

155
00:07:05,651 --> 00:07:06,400
So,
you know what I mean?

156
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,400
It's not going to be high five and you,
cause you're going to,

157
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:11,860
you know,
stick a lot of bugle your nose.

158
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:12,793
Isn't it harder though,
I think for champions because once they 

159
00:07:16,161 --> 00:07:17,990
like dominate someone to kick someone's 
ass,

160
00:07:17,991 --> 00:07:20,960
like say if you fight the,
the most difficult fight of your career,

161
00:07:20,961 --> 00:07:22,490
you fight,
you know,

162
00:07:22,491 --> 00:07:24,590
uh,
well there's Daniel Cormier,

163
00:07:24,591 --> 00:07:25,910
whoever it is,
you'd dominate them,

164
00:07:25,911 --> 00:07:29,090
you win and a beautiful fashion and then
you know,

165
00:07:29,091 --> 00:07:30,200
you like,
God damn it,

166
00:07:30,201 --> 00:07:31,630
I am the fucking man.
Yeah.

167
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:34,130
And then you just want to do whatever 
you want to do after that,

168
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,760
and it's indulgence and chaos.

169
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:37,660
Yeah.
He did it.

170
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:41,410
Or is both the eight comes to bite you 
on the ass all the time.

171
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:50,890
[inaudible] yeah.
