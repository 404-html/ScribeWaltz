1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,320
Ah,
Josh is ABS.

2
00:00:01,321 --> 00:00:02,900
We're live.
Hello mate.

3
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:04,020
What's up brother?
How you doing?

4
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:06,480
Good.
I've been all over the place.

5
00:00:06,481 --> 00:00:07,780
You have it all over that,
but I'm wondering,

6
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:09,030
don't.
I'm not even in a huff post live

7
00:00:09,031 --> 00:00:10,500
anymore.
I know you're wondering.

8
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:11,640
I'm a wonder here.
We,

9
00:00:11,641 --> 00:00:13,460
the people now I'm all the way to
people.

10
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,240
The way I like calling myself
unemployed.

11
00:00:15,241 --> 00:00:16,980
I think it's just more.
I think there's more.

12
00:00:16,981 --> 00:00:19,830
It takes more to just say that you're
unemployed until you're like,

13
00:00:19,831 --> 00:00:21,300
well,
I've got a lot of projects going on.

14
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,950
I've got a lot of fingers,
a lot of pies.

15
00:00:22,951 --> 00:00:24,600
And I'm like,
I'm freelance now.

16
00:00:24,601 --> 00:00:26,160
But aren't you self employed?
Yeah.

17
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:27,930
So that's not unemployed.
No,

18
00:00:27,931 --> 00:00:29,630
but I like fucking with people.
Oh,

19
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,510
you make them feel sad for you and make
them feel because people,

20
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,080
people want you to immediately say like
that you're doing okay and unemployed

21
00:00:37,081 --> 00:00:38,100
makes you sound like a bum.

22
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,350
So I like starting from the lowest
possible position.

23
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,580
You should tell people that you're going
to get a trailer and a,

24
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:44,920
you're going to travel across the
crunch.

25
00:00:44,921 --> 00:00:48,120
You get one of those things dragged
behind your car is going to live out of

26
00:00:48,121 --> 00:00:50,370
it yet,
and the national parks,

27
00:00:50,371 --> 00:00:53,010
the mall wakes.
I don't have a full time job that strong

28
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:56,530
of my accent skin and get pale.
I'm just dammit nickname,

29
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,960
nickname.
Here's my trailer.

30
00:00:57,961 --> 00:01:02,480
I haven't had a job in 15 years.
You can't go from Australian accent too.

31
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,590
Just did it.
Americans did it.

32
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:08,100
I just did it on allow that many people
say that things are impossible.

33
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:09,750
Joe Rogan,
but I'm here to prove them wrong.

34
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,820
Isn't it interesting?
How long have you moved to a place

35
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:16,200
you're not allowed to adopt the accent?
Like if an American moves to England,

36
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:18,690
like remember when Madonna,
she was only there for like six months.

37
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:20,640
She started talking like this and
everybody's like,

38
00:01:20,641 --> 00:01:22,320
bitch,
fuck out of here.

39
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:26,790
Like we know that people talk like that
and we know it's a style of.

40
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:28,920
It's an affectation.
You decided to talk like that.

41
00:01:28,921 --> 00:01:31,290
You don't have to talk like that.
You could obviously,

42
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:35,580
when you watch British actors play,
Americans do a brilliant job of talking

43
00:01:35,581 --> 00:01:37,860
in an American accent,
like the walking dead people.

44
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,660
When people find out that rick is,
that he's,

45
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:43,460
he's from England,
from England,

46
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,030
the girl Maggie,
she's from England.

47
00:01:45,031 --> 00:01:46,350
Everybody from fucking England.
Yeah.

48
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:48,670
And I'm in.
A lot of people don't know that those

49
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:50,850
are aussies as well.
If they're doing all over the American

50
00:01:50,851 --> 00:01:52,920
accents.
How often does Russell Crowe and don't

51
00:01:52,921 --> 00:01:55,130
have an American accent and imagery and
uh,

52
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:56,730
what's his face?
Fucking Batman.

53
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,190
Christian Bale.
He's Australian English.

54
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:03,300
Same Shit.
Don't get me started on the differences

55
00:02:03,301 --> 00:02:03,990
between New Zealand.

56
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:07,730
Isn't Australians as well?
Does this whole thing about who fuck

57
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:09,540
you?
This is the same spot,

58
00:02:09,541 --> 00:02:10,940
right?
Conduct condo.

59
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:12,810
It's about as different as Canada and
America.

60
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,330
Not really.
Not very rarely.

61
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,990
Barely close enough.
Uh,

62
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,580
there's a lot of dispute between the two
countries.

63
00:02:17,581 --> 00:02:19,590
About which one that has to cut.
Mel Gibson.

64
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:23,880
Mel was,
I think born in New Zealand and there's

65
00:02:23,881 --> 00:02:26,250
some bullshit about whether the reason
American Australian or New Zealand you

66
00:02:26,251 --> 00:02:28,020
can have him as long as he's not
Australian.

67
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:30,420
Everybody loved him for awhile.
He was so good.

68
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:33,180
He was awesome.
Just couldn't keep it together.

69
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:35,970
No wellbeing,
a wildly antisemitic,

70
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,440
racist.
Um,

71
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:40,380
religious nutjob doesn't help.
Do you think he's a crazy person though?

72
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:43,110
I don't know whether,
whether that means anything when you're

73
00:02:43,111 --> 00:02:45,090
that famous.
Of course it does.

74
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:46,680
It always means something.
I mean,

75
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:51,930
being that famous doesn't discount
certain biological realities of brain

76
00:02:52,321 --> 00:02:53,130
function.

77
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:55,530
I think people are bad.
Livers or livers go bad.

78
00:02:55,531 --> 00:02:58,950
People get lung cancer.
People without a doubt developed brain

79
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,540
diseases.
Whether or not it's a psychological

80
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:03,400
disease,
meaning is a disease of thought

81
00:03:03,401 --> 00:03:08,401
processes and taking you down bad roads.
Those bad thought process become

82
00:03:08,681 --> 00:03:13,681
ingrained and you continue them over and
over again out of habit or whether or

83
00:03:13,811 --> 00:03:16,270
not he's obviously an alcoholic,
right?

84
00:03:16,271 --> 00:03:17,890
So that's a real issue.
He,

85
00:03:17,891 --> 00:03:20,940
um,
he's had some problems like tech,

86
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:23,470
lung cancer for example.
Obviously the things that you do to your

87
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:26,560
body going to have a large impact on
whether or not you're likely to get lung

88
00:03:26,561 --> 00:03:27,394
cancer.
Sure.

89
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:29,500
And similarly,
I think that living in the rarefied

90
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:34,501
atmosphere of being incredibly,
outrageously famous probably put grooves

91
00:03:34,571 --> 00:03:37,360
in your mental pathways that predispose
you to being odd.

92
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:38,520
Good point.
Yeah,

93
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:40,120
definitely.
And as you get older,

94
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:42,310
when things start to fall apart,
you know,

95
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,600
physically and psychologically and
maritally and you know,

96
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:49,090
when he was with that crazy lady,
I mean that's what that is,

97
00:03:49,091 --> 00:03:50,680
is like the ultimate three court.

98
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:54,580
It's not midlife,
it's three quarters life like dilemma.

99
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,320
Yeah.
And how many people do you surround

100
00:03:56,321 --> 00:03:59,470
yourself with when you at that level of
superstardom who were willing to call

101
00:03:59,471 --> 00:04:01,270
bullshit on your bullshit,
right?

102
00:04:01,271 --> 00:04:05,590
Like I think a healthy famous person.
We will know them as people who are able

103
00:04:05,591 --> 00:04:07,750
to keep their head screwed on because
they still surround themselves with a

104
00:04:07,751 --> 00:04:08,710
posse who were like,
ah,

105
00:04:08,711 --> 00:04:10,330
get outta here.
What are you doing with this?

106
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:14,620
You've got a Latin mass still doing the
pre reformation Catholic,

107
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:19,180
like liturgies up on a hill in the
Hollywood hills and you're talking about

108
00:04:19,181 --> 00:04:20,860
how Jews caused all the wars in the
world.

109
00:04:20,861 --> 00:04:21,940
Get it.
What are you doing?

110
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:24,310
This is why people like buddy cop
movies.

111
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:27,550
Because in a buddy cop movie,
Danny Glover would straighten them back

112
00:04:27,551 --> 00:04:28,870
out,
he'd be like,

113
00:04:28,871 --> 00:04:30,670
come on man,
get it together,

114
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:33,340
and then he will pull it together and
you stop being crazy what?

115
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:36,430
He's by himself on a fucking mountain
and Malibu's screaming at the help

116
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:41,680
yelling at his Russian guy,
what's the name of his character?

117
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:46,500
And more open to doing what Mel Gibson's
and rigs rigs.

118
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:51,510
So Mel Gibson needs a danny glover.
The way that mountain riggs did.

119
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,320
Well,
he needs Danny Glover,

120
00:04:53,321 --> 00:04:56,830
the actual Danny Glover,
because if you pay attention to Danny

121
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,600
Glover's twitter feed and his social
media feed,

122
00:04:58,601 --> 00:05:03,601
it's all about like helping people out
and charities and spirituality and

123
00:05:04,481 --> 00:05:07,240
consideration for the earth.
And Danny Glover has got a really

124
00:05:07,241 --> 00:05:09,310
interesting.
I'll follow him.

125
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:13,810
He's a very open minded,
intelligent guy from the few things that

126
00:05:13,811 --> 00:05:16,060
I've paid attention to.
I think Danny Glover's like paying

127
00:05:16,061 --> 00:05:18,850
attention to the world.
They should be together for real.

128
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:21,880
I love,
I love it when people who you admire,

129
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:24,850
his craft you admire,
grow into being something more than

130
00:05:24,851 --> 00:05:26,140
that.
And like sort of spiritually

131
00:05:26,141 --> 00:05:26,590
enlightened.

132
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:28,820
It was like when Garry shandling died,
uh,

133
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,950
he had become someone who was super
interested in really interesting things.

134
00:05:32,951 --> 00:05:33,784
I mean,
he was,

135
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:36,160
I didn't know.
I didn't know much about them.

136
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:41,020
I didn't either until I was following
him on twitter when the day that he died

137
00:05:41,021 --> 00:05:45,940
I went to his twitter page to see what
his last tweets were and I saw that he

138
00:05:45,941 --> 00:05:47,620
was following me for some strange
reason,

139
00:05:47,621 --> 00:05:49,870
which makes me,
made me feel like all the more kind of

140
00:05:49,871 --> 00:05:53,560
close to him and started going back
through all of his old tweets and he's

141
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:58,940
just interested in spirituality,
all kinds of shit that you and I are

142
00:05:59,151 --> 00:06:00,590
interested in.
I didn't know him.

143
00:06:00,591 --> 00:06:02,450
I met him like re very briefly,
like,

144
00:06:02,451 --> 00:06:05,300
hi,
nice to meet you at the comedy and Magic

145
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,650
Club.
Never really got a chance to talk to

146
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:08,030
him,
but God,

147
00:06:08,031 --> 00:06:08,864
what a funny guy.

148
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:12,410
Larry Sanders show was amazing.
I mean two of the most groundbreaking

149
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,640
sitcoms,
like all of the,

150
00:06:13,641 --> 00:06:16,730
all of those sitcoms that now like
modern family and everything all have

151
00:06:16,731 --> 00:06:17,870
the same.
Like,

152
00:06:17,871 --> 00:06:19,850
this is a pseudo documentary and these
people are,

153
00:06:19,851 --> 00:06:22,550
for some reason talking to the camera,
it doesn't really make any sense

154
00:06:22,551 --> 00:06:24,530
anymore.
Like why is this documentary being made

155
00:06:24,531 --> 00:06:27,560
about these modern family people?
How long has this documentary?

156
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:30,020
Why not always like it's been on for
nine years or something?

157
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:32,970
Where's the documentary crew?
Why are they talking to the camera dot?

158
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:36,530
It's the whole conceit has broken down,
but all of those shows owe they're

159
00:06:36,531 --> 00:06:39,560
genesis to garry shandling,
to the fact that he did the Larry

160
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,510
Sanders show,
Larry Sanders show and it's Gary

161
00:06:41,511 --> 00:06:44,030
shandling show.
He had some great stuff.

162
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:46,440
Really great stuff.
So what's this shit about facebook?

163
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,050
I just walked in here and uh,
and you,

164
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:51,530
you told me that there are these pieces
about how facebook workers are admitting

165
00:06:51,531 --> 00:06:54,710
that they routinely suppressed
conservative news from the facebook

166
00:06:54,711 --> 00:06:55,370
newsfeed.

167
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:57,230
Yeah,
I actually got it from Steven crowder.

168
00:06:57,231 --> 00:07:00,560
He sent it to me and then I looked it up
and then I saw it was on Gizmodo and I

169
00:07:00,561 --> 00:07:01,520
was like,
wow,

170
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:06,580
this is crazy.
Like this enforcement of a liberal

171
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:10,370
liberal ideas.
Former facebook workers says we

172
00:07:10,371 --> 00:07:13,580
routinely suppressed conservative news,
so,

173
00:07:13,581 --> 00:07:15,380
uh,
they would keep conservative news from

174
00:07:15,381 --> 00:07:19,190
trending and they would,
uh,

175
00:07:19,191 --> 00:07:23,090
they would inject stories that weren't
trending.

176
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,890
They would inject them into the trending
stories if they match their ideologies.

177
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:30,500
I mean,
this is so dangerous and upsetting for

178
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:34,340
me even if you are a complete,
like liberal fascist and,

179
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:36,920
and you don't believe in freedom of
speech or freedom of ideas.

180
00:07:36,921 --> 00:07:40,550
But Jamie had a very interesting point
was that he was saying,

181
00:07:40,551 --> 00:07:43,730
but when you look at the believers,
like the Justin Bieber fans,

182
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,680
they overwhelmed the trending to the
point where twitter became the Justin

183
00:07:48,681 --> 00:07:52,100
bieber show and then twitter had to go,
okay,

184
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:53,750
all right,
settle the fuck down.

185
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,170
All these little 16 year old girls are
finger banging themselves and slamming

186
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:01,370
their fucking iphones and trying to get
this guy,

187
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:03,350
you know,
and try to pay attention to this guy

188
00:08:03,351 --> 00:08:04,880
constantly.
Twenty four hours a day.

189
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:06,980
Those believers are out of their fucking
mind.

190
00:08:06,981 --> 00:08:09,050
But that doesn't mean.
But what did twitter do?

191
00:08:09,051 --> 00:08:12,890
Something about that.
And Actually de Justin Bieber tweets is

192
00:08:12,891 --> 00:08:14,990
that long time ago,
like two or three years into twitter

193
00:08:14,991 --> 00:08:18,030
starting out.
There's 10 trending topics I believe

194
00:08:18,031 --> 00:08:20,660
that I remember is like seven out of the
10 were all Justin Bieber.

195
00:08:20,661 --> 00:08:22,880
This I love Justin Bieber,
whatever it was at the time.

196
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:29,810
I forgot to bring that up with Dan are
back from the arcs and the black keys

197
00:08:29,811 --> 00:08:34,070
when he was here because he'd got into
it with believers like they got into.

198
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:39,160
They got mad at him and done all the
people you could just in sheer numbers

199
00:08:39,381 --> 00:08:41,690
it's like,
it's like taking on a fight with an army

200
00:08:41,691 --> 00:08:43,520
of fire ants.
You're just not going to win.

201
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:46,490
You know what's interesting?
They get mad at you if you are older

202
00:08:46,491 --> 00:08:48,980
than them.
But if you use twitter,

203
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:52,430
like one of the things that they love to
say like you fucking old man.

204
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:56,340
Why are you even on twitter?
Like as if my generation invented it.

205
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,470
What they're trying to do is they're
trying to.

206
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:03,390
They're acknowledging this is a stupid
behavior and they would assume that

207
00:09:03,391 --> 00:09:07,020
you're old enough that you realize that
the stupid behavior and you should be

208
00:09:07,021 --> 00:09:07,854
better than that.

209
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,420
I'm allowed to be an immature little
bit.

210
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:13,080
John Fourteen.
What's your excuse?

211
00:09:13,081 --> 00:09:17,010
Just that there's something to that.
There's something that is a part of what

212
00:09:17,011 --> 00:09:19,650
they're saying.
Part of the technology and the

213
00:09:19,651 --> 00:09:22,420
ridiculousness,
the difference between de prioritizing,

214
00:09:22,421 --> 00:09:25,920
believer,
tweet hashtags and you know,

215
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:30,360
and using your status as the most
important social media information

216
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:32,580
company in the world.
Unless you're a believer.

217
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:35,850
And then I don't see your point bro.
I went on twitter looking for what's

218
00:09:35,851 --> 00:09:38,220
important,
what people are actually talking about.

219
00:09:38,221 --> 00:09:39,660
They're talking about Justin fucking
bieber.

220
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:44,010
Did you know you got to facetime to know
Jamie told me why.

221
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:49,110
Tell me why do you even know these?
Jamie's beyond saying Jaycee's wedding

222
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,260
24 hours a day at any given time.
You can tack how's,

223
00:09:52,261 --> 00:09:54,300
uh,
how's Bey and Jay doing right now?

224
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:55,223
They.
Okay.

225
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:57,600
And Jamie let you know what's the
latest.

226
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:00,750
Jamie's grinning like the Cheshire cat.
He's just like,

227
00:10:00,751 --> 00:10:01,810
Yep,
that's me.

228
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,800
That's what he does.
He wears yeezys.

229
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:07,140
But he buys easy's.
What's the.

230
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:12,360
Where's Justin bieber's face said to
Jamie.

231
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:15,330
Right below his eye.
Let's say you look at it like a tear or

232
00:10:15,331 --> 00:10:19,050
something.
What is it in that spot for Jesus to

233
00:10:19,051 --> 00:10:20,560
Jesus Tattoo?
Please tell me.

234
00:10:20,561 --> 00:10:22,520
You shitting me?
It's a Jesus tarries small.

235
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:26,580
Let's go with it.
It looks like it's a cross,

236
00:10:26,581 --> 00:10:29,880
bro.
It does look like it looks like a mole.

237
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,720
That's as big as it gets.
Some of us have a better version of.

238
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:36,210
It's across though,
right next to him.

239
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:37,740
Oh No.
Gay Together.

240
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:40,700
They're begging me for.
You guys are banging each other.

241
00:10:40,701 --> 00:10:44,190
You cannot tell the difference between
your tattoo and just a facial blemish.

242
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:46,310
You've got the wrong tattoo dude.
No,

243
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,300
he's got the right to that too.
Because you started off like that.

244
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,420
See what it is.
Is he wants to be like one of those

245
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:54,150
black guys like Birdman who has tattoos
all over his face.

246
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,410
Yeah.
She doesn't have that kind of balls.

247
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,900
So we're just going to go with a little
tiny thing that you eventually get

248
00:10:57,901 --> 00:10:58,980
lasered off.
Whatever,

249
00:10:58,981 --> 00:11:00,390
whatever.
Not that big a deal.

250
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:02,820
You know,
like who's got a lot of like stitches

251
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:06,600
says his name,
the white rappers got ak 47 tattooed on

252
00:11:06,601 --> 00:11:08,170
the side of his face.
Have you ever seen him know?

253
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:09,300
Oh,
he's the best.

254
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:12,460
As far as the worst as far as like if
I've asked,

255
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:15,060
you mean the worst person in the world
and the best examples of.

256
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,290
Oh,
he's got more tattoos.

257
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:17,940
Oh Wow.
That's beautiful.

258
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,950
He's got them on his neck and his
forehead now.

259
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,970
And what is the coolest thing about it
is he's got like basically the joker,

260
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:27,870
a like scars coming out of the sides of
his mouth that looked like they've got

261
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:28,860
stitches.
Hence his name.

262
00:11:28,861 --> 00:11:29,810
Stitches.
Yeah.

263
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:33,480
Well even has it on his lips,
like above his lips and to the sides and

264
00:11:33,481 --> 00:11:35,670
left and right.
What is the latest thing that he's got?

265
00:11:35,671 --> 00:11:39,300
He's got a star on his face to the AK
47.

266
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:40,131
Well,
he's got to start.

267
00:11:40,131 --> 00:11:43,020
And where Justin Bieber has his little,
his little mold.

268
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:45,900
That's the hotspot.
Sent me one of those.

269
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:48,900
That's like the dumb dudes version of a
lower back tattoo.

270
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:51,900
It's like a tramp stamp or retards.
That's what it is.

271
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,040
It's just the visibility

272
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:54,990
of it everywhere.
That would.

273
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,070
That would freak me out.
I got a couple of tattoos,

274
00:11:57,071 --> 00:11:59,890
but they're not in places where I'm
always going to be seen with them.

275
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,180
Not that it matters for Justin Bieber.
It's not like he's going to be going to

276
00:12:02,181 --> 00:12:03,790
a job interview and having to impress
them.

277
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,920
That's true,
but oh yeah,

278
00:12:05,921 --> 00:12:08,410
that's Gucci Mane.
Gucci Mane had an ice cream and an ice

279
00:12:08,411 --> 00:12:12,290
cream cone tattooed on his face with
lightening bolts and it says birth be

280
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:16,780
our our.
You know why that is?

281
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:19,660
And he also had some shit written under
his eyelids.

282
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:22,930
What does that say?
What does it say on his eyelids?

283
00:12:22,931 --> 00:12:24,560
Looks like old egg.
Looks like

284
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:29,140
a snake.
It's ingenious that he's said that he's

285
00:12:29,141 --> 00:12:33,130
got borough written on the ice cream
because ice cream is cold and when

286
00:12:33,131 --> 00:12:35,980
people are called they say so see what
he's done there.

287
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,800
Good point.
He's combined the Woodburn,

288
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:42,950
but the visual iconography of an ice
cream by linking these two formally

289
00:12:43,181 --> 00:12:45,520
disparate concepts in one beautiful
tattoo.

290
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:47,920
How about the student copy them?
Got The guy next to him.

291
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:50,020
He'd copy Gucci Mane.
That's even stupider.

292
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,720
Yeah.
He went with [inaudible].

293
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,391
He was like,
man,

294
00:12:52,391 --> 00:12:56,500
maybe I'll get to my Gucci's runoff
at the diner and be like,

295
00:12:56,501 --> 00:12:57,334
Yo,
gooch,

296
00:12:58,050 --> 00:12:59,380
they will stop.
You won't fuck.

297
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:05,020
Anyway.
The implications of a Justin bieber

298
00:13:05,021 --> 00:13:08,930
being deprioritized on twitter,
I still contend template.

299
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:11,020
You're going back not as,
not as great

300
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:15,700
as the implications of Facebook,
uh,

301
00:13:15,701 --> 00:13:19,520
hiding conservative news stories from
its uses on its news feed.

302
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:23,620
It's very unfortunate that someone did
this,

303
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:27,310
but it's very important that the workers
told us that they did this.

304
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:29,560
Yes.
Because it's supposed to be.

305
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,920
It's supposed to be an impartial.
I guess aggregator,

306
00:13:32,921 --> 00:13:33,490
I mean,
what is,

307
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:36,570
what would you call facebook?
It's a portal where doe for stories and

308
00:13:36,571 --> 00:13:38,170
things that are trending,
they've never,

309
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:42,130
they've never claimed that what you see
is just the most recent thing that is

310
00:13:42,131 --> 00:13:42,964
coming up.
Right.

311
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:46,080
I mean all of it is algorithms.
So the things that you tend to click on

312
00:13:46,081 --> 00:13:48,900
and the things that you tend to look at
and the things that you tend to like and

313
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:52,750
the stories that you tend to click
through to all go into their gigantic

314
00:13:52,751 --> 00:13:55,300
algorithm crunching machine,
which I just imagined as being like a

315
00:13:55,301 --> 00:13:57,610
big willy wonka machines with steam
coming up,

316
00:13:57,611 --> 00:14:02,611
pink steam coming out the top and
a little munchkin toy trains circling

317
00:14:02,901 --> 00:14:03,734
it.

318
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:08,890
You put in all of the data and then out
the other end of the Olympus compile

319
00:14:08,891 --> 00:14:12,970
your facebook feed and so they're making
judgments all the time about what

320
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:15,400
they're going to prioritize,
but what they shouldn't be doing is

321
00:14:15,401 --> 00:14:18,400
including any kind of their own
political preferences and we don't yet

322
00:14:18,401 --> 00:14:21,580
know if it's actually true or it just
looks like this is one person who is

323
00:14:21,581 --> 00:14:24,280
saying this
is.

324
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:27,730
Even if you.
Even if you don't these kinds of

325
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,020
policies in the.
You're a liberal.

326
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:31,840
You don't know what impact it's gonna
have and whether or not.

327
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,930
By putting this stuff out,
people are going to get more liberal.

328
00:14:34,931 --> 00:14:37,990
Maybe they'll get more frustrated with
liberal ideas and they'll become more

329
00:14:37,991 --> 00:14:41,440
conservative.
It's more likely to be that it fuels the

330
00:14:41,441 --> 00:14:45,430
idea that being a liberal is being a
person's detached from reality,

331
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:49,240
and that's one of the the the major
points of criticism.

332
00:14:49,241 --> 00:14:49,641
When,
when,

333
00:14:49,641 --> 00:14:51,440
when the conservative people go after
the liberals,

334
00:14:51,441 --> 00:14:52,280
one of the major

335
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:57,280
things that they try to harp on is that
liberals are out of touch with reality.

336
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:00,160
When you have something like this and
you're reinforcing the idea that there

337
00:15:00,161 --> 00:15:02,510
are shielding certain aspects of reality
like that.

338
00:15:02,511 --> 00:15:05,930
Some people have these conservative
opinions and if some people have a

339
00:15:05,931 --> 00:15:08,960
conservative opinion and you disagree
with that conservative opinion,

340
00:15:08,961 --> 00:15:13,640
that's where the open exchange and the
marketplace of ideas comes into place.

341
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:16,160
Now,
if you don't allow that exchange take

342
00:15:16,161 --> 00:15:20,000
place because you deny that people think
that way because you hide the stories

343
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:21,920
you're going to alienate.
You're going to create these

344
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:25,100
confirmation bias forums.
You're going to create these places

345
00:15:25,101 --> 00:15:27,320
where people like salon.com,
where people just.

346
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:30,140
They agree with each other to the point
and then they tell you why.

347
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:32,570
You know,
why is Josh Zaps the worst?

348
00:15:32,571 --> 00:15:34,790
Will tell you why,
and then they tell you.

349
00:15:34,791 --> 00:15:38,270
They ask a question like eight points,
like eight reasons why justice is the

350
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:38,600
worst.

351
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,330
Here's why he's terribly.
I'd give you a dozen,

352
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,210
but it's.
It's not news anymore.

353
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:48,470
There's so hysterically ridiculous is so
off the deep end.

354
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:51,350
I mean it used to be the case that we
thought of progressives and liberals as

355
00:15:51,351 --> 00:15:53,600
being more pro free speech,
or at least I did.

356
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:57,470
I use the side of more inclusiveness and
more tolerance and it's becoming

357
00:15:57,471 --> 00:16:00,350
increasingly not the case at all.
That there's more politically correct

358
00:16:00,351 --> 00:16:02,780
bullshit and most censorship and more
imposing,

359
00:16:02,781 --> 00:16:05,060
less tolerance of each of other people's
ideas on the lift.

360
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:06,770
Even though they're on the run.
I,

361
00:16:06,771 --> 00:16:10,160
I 100 percent believed that,
but I believe it's the pendulum effect.

362
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:13,370
I think it's the suppression of free
speech by the Conservatives and the Bush

363
00:16:13,371 --> 00:16:16,130
administration that fuck people up so
sideways.

364
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:18,470
They bounce back the other way,
ultra hard.

365
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:23,090
I think people got so angry at what was
going on with John Ashcroft covering

366
00:16:23,091 --> 00:16:25,480
statues up with drapes and oh,
I loved that.

367
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:28,770
All the craziness that was going on in
that administration and all the

368
00:16:28,771 --> 00:16:31,670
suppression of gay rights as everyone
know about that,

369
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:36,750
the fact that John Ashcroft actually had
the penis on a statue on an old Roman

370
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:42,110
statue and she was like in one of the
great temples down in Washington DC

371
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:45,320
covered up because he was so
puritanical.

372
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:48,830
He didn't want a naked penis from an
agent statue.

373
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:52,380
He was disturbing that that guy got into
office.

374
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:54,440
One of the,
one of the guys that uh,

375
00:16:54,441 --> 00:16:59,441
I correspond with online.
He had something to do with some record

376
00:16:59,841 --> 00:17:04,841
store and he sent me an album of Gospel
songs that John Ashcroft had made with

377
00:17:06,711 --> 00:17:11,090
some other dude.
He was fucking and probably still is bat

378
00:17:11,091 --> 00:17:12,650
shit crazy.
Well,

379
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:14,240
I mean they,
they,

380
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:15,350
they kind of,
what do you call it,

381
00:17:15,351 --> 00:17:19,940
like when you stack like that basically
stacked the Bush administration with a

382
00:17:19,941 --> 00:17:22,100
lot of crazy people like that.
Like the first,

383
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:25,330
especially the first administration of
the Bush administration,

384
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:28,640
the 2000 man.
You look at some of those paypal,

385
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:30,780
they basically theocrats.
I mean,

386
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,650
they're not that different from a
Christian version of what the Iranian

387
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:34,820
leaders.
Ah,

388
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:35,541
well,
not only that,

389
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:39,410
there's so caricature that they seem
like characters in a movie,

390
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:41,630
like a bad action movie.
I mean,

391
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:45,500
you think about what you've got.
You've got Donald Rumsfeld and Dick

392
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:48,560
Cheney to people arguably forged in the
center of the earth.

393
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:50,280
I mean,
they're fucking

394
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,930
straight up evil,
right?

395
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,990
Dick Cheney is straight up evil.
He got to a point where he didn't have a

396
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:57,140
fucking heartbeat.
No.

397
00:17:57,150 --> 00:18:01,260
I mean the guy had an artificial heart
put in which was pumping his blood

398
00:18:01,261 --> 00:18:03,230
through.
Still have no power.

399
00:18:03,231 --> 00:18:04,840
You had a transplant it.
Oh,

400
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:07,410
does he have a live?
Have found some dude and cut his fucking

401
00:18:07,411 --> 00:18:10,160
heart out.
You Bet your ass they did with one stone

402
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:13,560
knives.
We have to have a match your bullshit.

403
00:18:13,561 --> 00:18:15,740
You happen to have a met.
She knew that they would have killed

404
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,520
somebody.
Has some secret service agent

405
00:18:17,521 --> 00:18:20,700
disappeared.
One secret service agent and really

406
00:18:20,701 --> 00:18:24,990
healthy diet.
Fucking that guy open like a fish.

407
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:27,540
You can just imagine they've probably
got like a tinder for,

408
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:29,790
for Dick Cheney,
where he's just swiping left and swiping

409
00:18:29,791 --> 00:18:32,310
right on the people who they're going to
kill for his heart.

410
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:33,420
You got a 23 year old.

411
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:37,210
He did.
He and Ashcroft and uh,

412
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:39,750
there was,
there was a whole bunch of them

413
00:18:39,751 --> 00:18:42,810
Wolfowitz.
I mean that guy looked like a demon,

414
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,630
you know,
think,

415
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:49,350
I mean all of those fucking that the
whole administration was filled with

416
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:54,330
chicken hawks that we're all about Jesus
and wanting to go over there and kick

417
00:18:54,331 --> 00:18:56,100
some ass.
Fucking blow shit up.

418
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:59,490
It's interesting you mentioned Wolfowitz
because in terms of like what was saying

419
00:18:59,491 --> 00:19:02,370
about the left is can be intolerant of
other ideas.

420
00:19:02,371 --> 00:19:06,170
A lot of these guys,
especially Wolfowitz with Forma Marxists

421
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:09,030
when,
when Wolfowitz was young at university,

422
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,310
he was a revolutionary Marxist.
Whoa.

423
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:15,180
And it's interesting that oftentimes
people who who are hypo revolutionary

424
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:20,360
socialists can flip into becoming hyper,
an Randian idealistic reaction raise.

425
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:24,170
And there's the same kind of like when
you,

426
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:26,340
it's,
it's not that different when you think

427
00:19:26,341 --> 00:19:28,830
about it,
like people think of them as being ideas

428
00:19:28,831 --> 00:19:30,450
that are at the end of the political
spectrum,

429
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,760
but it's excellent actually more like a
horseshoe,

430
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:33,690
right?

431
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:38,160
Where at one end you think that you can
overthrow the capitalist system and

432
00:19:38,161 --> 00:19:42,840
create a utopia in which everyone is
gonna be be equal and it's going to be

433
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:45,780
from each according to his ability to
each according to his need.

434
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:50,190
And then at the other end you believe
that you can wipe society is clean,

435
00:19:50,191 --> 00:19:53,460
you can go into Iraq and raise
everything and then start from fresh and

436
00:19:53,461 --> 00:19:56,820
democracy will spring up and people will
be able to live in pace.

437
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,670
I mean they're both basically kind of
mess niantic,

438
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:03,900
Utopian ideas about change instead of
the sort of change that I think actually

439
00:20:03,901 --> 00:20:06,780
works,
which is just incremental grudging

440
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,900
change bit by bit.
Slowly Eking it out.

441
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,450
Yeah.
That's not what Chaney and Wolfowitz

442
00:20:12,451 --> 00:20:13,740
think the world is all about.
No,

443
00:20:13,741 --> 00:20:17,490
they tried to force change and force
change at home and abroad.

444
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:21,540
And that's where like the conspiracy
theories come in about nine slash 11

445
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:25,080
attacks and Dick Cheney saying that we
need something like an a

446
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:28,540
Pearl Harbor and that's where people
really freak out because they look at

447
00:20:28,541 --> 00:20:31,390
how much people actually did profit from
that event.

448
00:20:31,391 --> 00:20:31,901
So they go,
well,

449
00:20:31,901 --> 00:20:35,050
okay,
is it possible that someone had a part

450
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:39,880
in letting that event happen or helping
that event happened or ignoring the fact

451
00:20:39,881 --> 00:20:42,310
that event was gonna happen and allowing
it to happen?

452
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:46,480
Or is it a matter of people just
capitalizing on an event?

453
00:20:46,481 --> 00:20:49,740
Which is what the most logical point of
view is that they.

454
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:52,060
There's incompetent,
the event happened,

455
00:20:52,061 --> 00:20:54,670
and then they capitalized on it.
Like any good dictatorship.

456
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:55,660
Yeah,
exactly.

457
00:20:55,661 --> 00:20:57,590
I mean,
I do think when you look at Helen

458
00:20:57,610 --> 00:20:59,650
competently,
they managed Iraq.

459
00:20:59,651 --> 00:21:02,140
When you're looking at and competently
they managed Katrina.

460
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:04,960
When you look at how and competently
they manage things that they wanted to

461
00:21:04,961 --> 00:21:07,750
get right.
The idea that they could have pulled off

462
00:21:07,751 --> 00:21:09,850
something like that within eight months
of entering office.

463
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:13,380
I find implausible like whenever the.
If I have to choose between in

464
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:17,650
competence versus a massive conspiracy,
I usually think people are just

465
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:18,550
generally incompetent.

466
00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:21,290
Then do you even start that
conversation?

467
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:24,110
How do you even say,
listen here,

468
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:25,570
this out,
before you get crazy here,

469
00:21:25,571 --> 00:21:26,750
the side,
I got an idea.

470
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:32,590
We got to talk some dudes into flying
planes into the world.

471
00:21:33,171 --> 00:21:35,870
Trade Center towers one and two.
We're going to hijack planes,

472
00:21:35,871 --> 00:21:38,270
fill with people.
We're going to talk these guys into

473
00:21:38,271 --> 00:21:40,310
flying them into the,
into the buildings.

474
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:41,061
They'd be like,
wait,

475
00:21:41,061 --> 00:21:41,331
what?
What,

476
00:21:41,331 --> 00:21:41,651
what,
what?

477
00:21:41,651 --> 00:21:42,890
What?
Who the fuck is going to do that?

478
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,260
Religious people,
you got to get them to believe that

479
00:21:45,261 --> 00:21:47,690
there's a bunch of posts he waiting for
them in heaven and all they have to do

480
00:21:47,691 --> 00:21:49,490
is fly these planes into buildings to
get that pussy.

481
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:49,911
Uh,
yeah.

482
00:21:49,911 --> 00:21:50,391
But see,
Joe,

483
00:21:50,391 --> 00:21:52,930
these plans had long been hatching as
they were.

484
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,700
They were camps in Afghanistan,
which we will funding.

485
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:59,410
Is that your Alex Jones impression?
I can feel it coming on with Alex Jones.

486
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:02,080
No,
Alex Jones would be yelling at me right

487
00:22:02,081 --> 00:22:03,340
now explaining why I'm wrong.

488
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:05,280
Um,
I just.

489
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:07,440
So there's a much easier way to have
done it,

490
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:10,230
which is if,
if you wanted a pretext to go into Iraq

491
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:13,520
or you'd need to do would be.
I was talking to the national defense

492
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:14,520
guy about this.
He was like,

493
00:22:14,521 --> 00:22:19,521
there was a no fly zone over Iraq.
The CIA could have painted a US plane,

494
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:24,770
the Iraqi colors and just faked a shoot
down a US or British jet that was

495
00:22:25,411 --> 00:22:30,060
patrolling the no fly zone and you would
have a clear much clearer case actually

496
00:22:30,061 --> 00:22:33,870
in international law to go to war.
Then the vague case that they did do,

497
00:22:33,871 --> 00:22:35,460
because they didn't.
I mean it wasn't connected to nine slash

498
00:22:35,461 --> 00:22:36,810
11,
so they have to make up this shit about

499
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:40,020
wmds and all that sort of stuff.
You could easily have orchestrated

500
00:22:40,021 --> 00:22:41,760
something without bringing down the
world trade towers.

501
00:22:41,761 --> 00:22:43,530
That would have given you a good reason
to go into Iraq.

502
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:48,560
Well that was one of the main reasons
why a lot of people bought into.

503
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:52,220
Do you know about operation northwoods?
Do you know that story that's only heard

504
00:22:52,221 --> 00:22:53,054
you talk about it?
Yeah.

505
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:56,510
The operation northwoods,
that was that exact plan to get people

506
00:22:56,511 --> 00:22:58,520
to go to war with Cuba to get us excited
about it.

507
00:22:58,521 --> 00:23:00,470
They were going to blow up in American
drone.

508
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:03,230
They were going to send a jetliner up in
the air with no one in it and shoot it

509
00:23:03,231 --> 00:23:05,960
out of the sky.
They were gonna arm,

510
00:23:05,961 --> 00:23:08,060
Cuban friendlies and attack Guantanamo
Bay.

511
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:11,720
That was the main idea behind it was
like this would be the way we could get

512
00:23:11,721 --> 00:23:16,040
people excited about going to war with
Cuba because you know that whole Bay of

513
00:23:16,041 --> 00:23:19,350
pigs and all that fucking disaster that
happened when Kennedy was in office.

514
00:23:19,351 --> 00:23:20,720
I mean,
and then the missile crisis,

515
00:23:20,721 --> 00:23:22,940
there was a lot of tension going on with
Cuba,

516
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:26,210
so they had concocted this idea.
It's called operation northwoods.

517
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:28,940
It was signed by the Joint Chiefs of
staff,

518
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:31,360
so they went with it like there were
like,

519
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:35,090
sounds like democracy and they let's
just fucking lie to people and blow shit

520
00:23:35,091 --> 00:23:37,460
up and kill Americans.
They were going to fucking kill

521
00:23:37,461 --> 00:23:39,350
Americans in Guantanamo Bay.
Oh,

522
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:40,550
you've been blaming on the cube.

523
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:43,910
I'm sure they have because they're so
because there's such unscrupulous

524
00:23:43,911 --> 00:23:46,820
assholes and they do all of they.
They do these legitimate conspiracy

525
00:23:46,821 --> 00:23:48,830
theories.
That's what gives people reasons to

526
00:23:48,831 --> 00:23:51,470
believe in the more than what I regard
as being that much more ridiculous

527
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:54,020
conspiracy theories,
but it would be a lot better if they

528
00:23:54,021 --> 00:23:56,840
just didn't do any of this shit in the
first place and then people wouldn't be

529
00:23:56,841 --> 00:23:59,420
out of their minds being so suspicious
about whether or not nine slash 11 was

530
00:23:59,421 --> 00:24:00,230
an inside job.

531
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:01,220
Well,
there's also,

532
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:06,290
there was the word that Dick Cheney was
discussing the possibility of doing

533
00:24:06,291 --> 00:24:09,170
something like that for Iran before they
left office.

534
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:13,220
They were talking about orchestrating a
false flag on a ran before they left

535
00:24:13,221 --> 00:24:17,660
office and they never pulled it off.
Whether or not it's true or not remains

536
00:24:17,661 --> 00:24:19,790
to be seen,
but it's not outside the realm of

537
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:20,690
possibility.
I mean,

538
00:24:20,691 --> 00:24:25,130
it happened in so many different times
in history when Nero burned Rome,

539
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:29,180
when Hitler burned the Reichstag.
When I mean the whole.

540
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:31,580
What happened to get us into Vietnam?

541
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,540
Well that's right.
Like the Gulf of Tonkin,

542
00:24:33,810 --> 00:24:35,430
Gulf of Tonkin.
They tended,

543
00:24:35,431 --> 00:24:36,720
we got shot at.
That's right,

544
00:24:36,721 --> 00:24:39,100
and there's also a little.
You don't even have to go as far as like

545
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,310
the Nazis,
just in terms of what the CIA has done,

546
00:24:41,311 --> 00:24:44,640
encounter up counterinsurgency
operations in south South America and

547
00:24:44,641 --> 00:24:47,400
stuff.
The involvement in the coup in 1973 in

548
00:24:47,401 --> 00:24:49,350
Chile.
I was reading up about that lately

549
00:24:49,351 --> 00:24:50,850
because I went to Chile a couple of
years ago.

550
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:56,240
I mean it's not that they absolutely
completely manufacture total bullshit

551
00:24:56,251 --> 00:25:00,900
from whole cloth,
but they give voice to conspiracy

552
00:25:00,901 --> 00:25:05,460
theories in those particular countries.
They fund a media outlets that are,

553
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:08,610
that are spreading.
We know what the CIA wants to get hurt

554
00:25:08,611 --> 00:25:11,370
and they just basically put their finger
on the scales of something so that it

555
00:25:11,371 --> 00:25:13,620
goes another way.
I mean the democratically elected

556
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:17,220
government in Chile was overthrown by a
brutal military dictatorship,

557
00:25:17,221 --> 00:25:18,960
which then lasted for an entire
generation.

558
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,800
Thanks largely to the CIA.
I mean we don't even think or hear or

559
00:25:22,801 --> 00:25:26,610
learn about that stuff.
And do you think that it's possible for

560
00:25:26,611 --> 00:25:27,600
them to go,
listen,

561
00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:30,290
you got to break some eggs to make an
omelet.

562
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:34,350
You want America to be America led.
The free home of the brave was the only

563
00:25:34,351 --> 00:25:35,880
one wig.
We got to fucking lie to you.

564
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:38,280
We've got to kick some ass.
A lot of shit we'd like to tell you,

565
00:25:38,281 --> 00:25:40,770
but the world works and really fucked up
way and you don't want to know about

566
00:25:40,771 --> 00:25:42,360
that because you want to watch real
housewives.

567
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:43,870
Exactly.
What we're going to do now,

568
00:25:43,871 --> 00:25:44,610
and I,
I have,

569
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:46,140
I actually have some sympathy for that
idea.

570
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:48,660
I,
a friend of a friend of mine was easily

571
00:25:48,661 --> 00:25:52,220
former director of the CIA.
I spent a Thanksgiving with him once

572
00:25:52,221 --> 00:25:54,210
down in Washington DC.
Did you look in his basement?

573
00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:57,720
Tall skulls,
open the doors sculptural out in the

574
00:25:57,721 --> 00:26:00,810
hallway.
And when I talked to people like that,

575
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,570
yeah,
I do understand that our vision of the

576
00:26:03,571 --> 00:26:08,400
world is a very small sliver and can be
quite naive,

577
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:10,590
very naive.
Their attitude is when you're actually

578
00:26:10,591 --> 00:26:12,600
working in the national security
apparatus,

579
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:16,740
their apparatus apparatus,
we might've made a word that'll do.

580
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:19,200
I just did it.
Just showing you think he made up a

581
00:26:19,201 --> 00:26:20,034
word,
but it sounds.

582
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:23,010
I like it.
If you didn't just stop yourself,

583
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:26,130
then the apparatus would be a new word.
A lot of people at home would.

584
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:28,690
It went okay.
It seems like a smart guy.

585
00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:32,790
If you actually work there,
then I think your outlook is basically

586
00:26:32,791 --> 00:26:34,560
what you just articulated,
which is,

587
00:26:35,050 --> 00:26:35,690
um,
it,

588
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:38,880
it'll be lovely if we all lived in a
world where with ice cream and candy and

589
00:26:38,881 --> 00:26:40,940
where the lines slipped with the lambs
and the,

590
00:26:40,941 --> 00:26:43,530
and the postman hug the dogs and we were
all dancing the streets.

591
00:26:43,531 --> 00:26:46,590
But listen Honcho,
it's a tough world out there and either

592
00:26:46,591 --> 00:26:48,830
the Saddam Hussein's and the Putin's are
going to roll it away.

593
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:51,240
And sometimes you have to break a few
weeks in order to make an Omelette.

594
00:26:51,241 --> 00:26:52,590
And sometimes you have to do things
that,

595
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:54,240
uh,
that might not seem pretty on the

596
00:26:54,241 --> 00:26:55,980
surface.
But I'll tell you what were the ones who

597
00:26:55,981 --> 00:26:59,550
are standing on the wall watching God.
So you go about your business and we'll

598
00:26:59,551 --> 00:27:01,850
take care of shit.
I heard the national anthem playing.

599
00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:04,910
You really did.
Which won the Australian one.

600
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:10,230
Cool.
Who's cruise on?

601
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:13,180
Wait,
whatever.

602
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:16,640
It's all the same.
Even American.

603
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:19,070
I'm probably Canadian or something.
Barely America.

604
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:20,390
Uh,
America.

605
00:27:20,391 --> 00:27:21,680
The beautiful.
Shouldn't be the national anthem.

606
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:23,750
Can I just say that?
That's better.

607
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:27,080
Stop bangled banner.
Start rockets in it though.

608
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:29,810
I'm going to probably stick with that.
The rockets.

609
00:27:29,811 --> 00:27:34,100
Red Glare.
The bombs bursting in air.

610
00:27:34,101 --> 00:27:39,101
What you bombs bursting in air.
That's in our fucking national anthem.

611
00:27:39,661 --> 00:27:42,300
I love how warmongering so many national
anthems.

612
00:27:42,301 --> 00:27:43,850
And I like the French.
The French one.

613
00:27:43,851 --> 00:27:48,770
It literally has the lyrics about the
blood of our enemies will fill the

614
00:27:48,771 --> 00:27:51,770
canals of France.
It's serious shit.

615
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:54,700
That's unrealistic.
People you have to call you just.

616
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,690
You guys are just lying.
There's no happened.

617
00:27:56,810 --> 00:28:01,810
Bombs actually could burst in there and
do and have doubled the canals fucker.

618
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:05,810
You killing man killer.
But you'd have to kill everybody on the

619
00:28:05,811 --> 00:28:07,130
planet to fill the canals of blood.

620
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:08,840
It'd be no one left.
Well,

621
00:28:08,841 --> 00:28:10,990
I mean I killed a lot of Germans in the
gym.

622
00:28:10,991 --> 00:28:13,010
Is killed a lot of Russians.
Have you seen some of the numbers?

623
00:28:13,011 --> 00:28:16,160
There's a great graphic that I think
like vox produced or something about the

624
00:28:16,161 --> 00:28:18,440
number of people in total who were
killed in,

625
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:21,560
in the world wars.
Each one represented like each thousand

626
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,150
dollars million.
He's represented by little block.

627
00:28:23,151 --> 00:28:24,680
I don't even know what you're talking
about,

628
00:28:24,681 --> 00:28:28,010
but it's just crazy when you start
seeing how many people look at you.

629
00:28:28,011 --> 00:28:28,341
Like,
Oh,

630
00:28:28,341 --> 00:28:30,620
this is a lot who were killed in,
for example,

631
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:33,860
Iraq war and it goes back to Vietnam.
You know,

632
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:37,810
what will one world war two,
the towards the final few years will

633
00:28:37,811 --> 00:28:42,260
will to even excluding the Holocaust,
just looking at people like mainly

634
00:28:42,261 --> 00:28:47,261
Russians,
which she asked state just millions upon

635
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:50,380
millions upon millions of people,
like 20 million people don't think

636
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:52,330
about.
The Russians have died in World War II.

637
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:55,130
There was a lot more of them died than
us.

638
00:28:55,131 --> 00:28:57,830
And often,
I mean if you talk to a military

639
00:28:57,831 --> 00:29:00,290
historian,
what really ended the war?

640
00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:01,610
Yes,
Dj was important.

641
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,530
But,
but the Soviets won the war,

642
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,870
I mean it was,
it was the fact that the Nazis were just

643
00:29:05,871 --> 00:29:09,560
hemorrhaging in the east.
That meant that they couldn't put up any

644
00:29:09,561 --> 00:29:10,940
defenses in the,
in the West.

645
00:29:10,941 --> 00:29:12,170
So Dj was a,
you know,

646
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:15,410
not to insult the are great forefathers
who fought there,

647
00:29:15,411 --> 00:29:17,780
but data was a little bit of a walk in
the park in comparison to what was

648
00:29:17,781 --> 00:29:18,650
happening on the eastern front.

649
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:20,920
Well,
there was a lot going on all across the

650
00:29:20,921 --> 00:29:23,920
world,
but one of the scariest things about

651
00:29:23,921 --> 00:29:28,750
France and what happened to them during
World War II is the amount of France to

652
00:29:28,751 --> 00:29:33,751
this day that you literally can't even
visit because it's so filled with waste

653
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:39,100
from all the bombs that were dropped.
You seen as an area larger than Paris

654
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:44,280
that's completely fenced in and can't go
in it because it's got so much munitions

655
00:29:44,531 --> 00:29:46,450
and so many bombs that were dropped
there.

656
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:49,480
It's so fucked up.
That will be that way for something like

657
00:29:49,481 --> 00:29:51,550
100,000 years or something crazy.
I mean,

658
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,110
it's poison gas

659
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:55,750
bodies.
They're just still buddies,

660
00:29:55,751 --> 00:29:58,000
just bones and shit.
There's this little town in northern

661
00:29:58,001 --> 00:30:00,940
France called villas retina where the
aussies were,

662
00:30:00,941 --> 00:30:01,660
I mean,
you know,

663
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:04,600
no one ever thinks about the [inaudible]
and then using this little countries who

664
00:30:04,601 --> 00:30:06,700
were fighting there as well,
but of course they had their own little

665
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:10,630
little plots that they had to had to
fight and there was this big heroic

666
00:30:10,631 --> 00:30:13,780
stand against the Germans,
which the aussies were in charge of it

667
00:30:13,781 --> 00:30:17,890
villas retina and still to this day in
the little in the schools and the

668
00:30:17,891 --> 00:30:20,020
elementary schools there,
they sing the Australian national

669
00:30:20,021 --> 00:30:22,540
anthem.
They have little Australian flags flying

670
00:30:22,541 --> 00:30:24,940
and stuff because they have failed to
just littered with the bodies of

671
00:30:24,941 --> 00:30:28,840
Australians in northern France from the
world war.

672
00:30:29,050 --> 00:30:30,640
Wow.
That's crazy.

673
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:32,950
Naughty.
What will we do it than to make any

674
00:30:32,951 --> 00:30:35,500
sense of the side of the world should
have just stayed home?

675
00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:37,000
Well,
I think we saw some of those Hitler

676
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:37,870
speeches.
One went,

677
00:30:37,930 --> 00:30:40,300
oh,
we're going to have to do something.

678
00:30:40,301 --> 00:30:43,000
Here is this guy,
this Guy Mike.

679
00:30:43,330 --> 00:30:45,970
He might have the right stuff to fucking
become the real darth vader.

680
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:46,930
Yeah.
That's,

681
00:30:46,931 --> 00:30:47,610
uh,
that,

682
00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:51,640
that charismatic person who's completely
insane that wants to conquer the world

683
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:54,430
and gets a whole nation behind them is
so Donald Trump,

684
00:30:54,431 --> 00:30:56,080
I mean,
it's so crazy and scary

685
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:02,770
will where he's not trying to take over
the world,

686
00:31:02,771 --> 00:31:07,771
but it shows you how problematic
personality can be when it comes to

687
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:14,020
someone being chosen to be the leader,
especially to this day and in this day

688
00:31:14,021 --> 00:31:18,430
rather were so soft this day of food
coming on these little styrofoam trays

689
00:31:18,431 --> 00:31:21,610
and being able to pull up to Wendy's and
get a fucking cheeseburger and 15

690
00:31:21,611 --> 00:31:25,810
seconds.
We're so weak and it's so easy to exist

691
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:31,050
that we're excited about this guy
possibly like overturned the apple cart

692
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:32,343
where people are

693
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:35,170
who don't have any people,
don't have any other options as well.

694
00:31:35,171 --> 00:31:39,350
I feel like Bernie and trump with a,
with a ways in different ways that

695
00:31:39,370 --> 00:31:41,920
people had the people who've been on it
for a long time.

696
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:46,380
White working class dudes mostly have to
like.

697
00:31:46,390 --> 00:31:51,220
I mean when you look at the effect that
middle incomes of middle American has

698
00:31:51,221 --> 00:31:55,810
been stagnating for the past 30 years.
Manufacturing has been in decline like

699
00:31:55,811 --> 00:31:58,060
they haven't been.
There hasn't been a rise in working

700
00:31:58,061 --> 00:32:00,910
class incomes in America since the
eighties.

701
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:04,450
I was surprised that Elizabeth Warren
didn't get more traction.

702
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:07,870
It seems like once that native American
stuff came out about her,

703
00:32:07,871 --> 00:32:09,060
she just went,
Oh Kim,

704
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:11,830
just kind of stuff.
They think she believes that she is more

705
00:32:11,831 --> 00:32:13,840
useful in the Senate maybe,
but you know,

706
00:32:13,841 --> 00:32:18,280
the native American stuff where she
faked a native American heritage in

707
00:32:18,281 --> 00:32:20,320
order to get some sort of a scholarship.

708
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:22,470
When I hear things like that,
I use my brain.

709
00:32:22,471 --> 00:32:25,650
It just hits the.
This is probably a btob part of my brain

710
00:32:25,651 --> 00:32:27,570
and it just goes straight out my ear
because I don't.

711
00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:28,890
I don't really give a shit about that.

712
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:31,030
Stuff like that.
You don't care about someone faking

713
00:32:31,031 --> 00:32:33,670
their ethnicity.
Why didn't I didn't look into it enough.

714
00:32:33,890 --> 00:32:35,030
Me I

715
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,820
needed to.
She's a brilliant woman.

716
00:32:36,821 --> 00:32:37,191
What?
Why?

717
00:32:37,191 --> 00:32:38,210
Why was she doing it?
Well,

718
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,000
wanted to get into a university.
She have to go

719
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,020
pull that up.
Jamie.

720
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:43,220
Find out what the fuck that was all
about,

721
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,350
but I don't know.
I mean,

722
00:32:45,351 --> 00:32:48,080
who knows if she actually did it,
maybe someone else did it and she sort

723
00:32:48,081 --> 00:32:51,500
of went with it.
So difficult to talking to her.

724
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:54,620
If it's a Rachel dolezal thing with
someone who spent their whole life

725
00:32:54,621 --> 00:32:56,120
pretending to be something that they're
not,

726
00:32:56,150 --> 00:32:58,310
then I think yes,
that there's a quite a few of those out

727
00:32:58,311 --> 00:32:59,350
there though.
Then I,

728
00:32:59,351 --> 00:33:03,080
I do think that that's disqualifying,
but I feel like if the only thing that

729
00:33:03,081 --> 00:33:06,560
you'll political opponents can dig up on
you is that you filled out a form wrong,

730
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:09,590
but that's not filling out a form wrong.
That's being deceptive about your

731
00:33:09,591 --> 00:33:14,540
ethnicity in order to take advantage of
like people that are undermined by

732
00:33:14,541 --> 00:33:16,040
society.
I mean,

733
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:18,080
when you go with your ranking,
let's kill her

734
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:23,370
to put her into trump's concentration.

735
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:28,170
We don't have any.
Uh,

736
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:30,190
yeah.
Trump isn't,

737
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:31,170
is fascinating,
isn't it?

738
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:32,460
I can't believe it's actually going to
happen.

739
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:34,470
He might,
when he,

740
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:38,870
he's real close to winning because I
just don't know whether or not Hillary

741
00:33:38,871 --> 00:33:41,990
can hold up to scrutiny when you're
talking about her being under to

742
00:33:41,991 --> 00:33:44,690
criminal investigations and the right
now.

743
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:45,980
Right now,
the immediate future,

744
00:33:45,981 --> 00:33:47,510
this to criminal investigations going
on,

745
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:51,140
they just gave immunity to the guy who
set up that email server.

746
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:54,330
They deported him.
They brought him over to America.

747
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,270
Extra added them wanting to do.
What's that called?

748
00:33:57,710 --> 00:33:59,810
They brought them over to America and
gave him immunity.

749
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:01,770
So what the fuck man?
What,

750
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:03,260
what is gonna Happen Now?
Well,

751
00:34:03,261 --> 00:34:04,550
yeah,
we are one.

752
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:07,190
Uh,
I was talking to a guy hacked it rather

753
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,113
immunity.
Yeah.

754
00:34:09,530 --> 00:34:11,520
Um,
I was talking to body laying on the,

755
00:34:11,521 --> 00:34:12,850
on my podcast about them.

756
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:14,540
And that's not true.
Hold on a second.

757
00:34:14,850 --> 00:34:16,940
They give immunity to go set up the
server.

758
00:34:16,941 --> 00:34:19,700
The extradited.
The guy who created the hack that he

759
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:21,650
doesn't have immunity.
Where do you think I hacked?

760
00:34:21,651 --> 00:34:23,480
I think he's from Romania.
The coolest,

761
00:34:23,930 --> 00:34:24,890
coolest.
He's from Romania.

762
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:28,520
The Guy who hacked into the serve,
the email servers and exposed all that.

763
00:34:28,521 --> 00:34:31,520
I want to say he's from a very small
rural town in Romania.

764
00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:33,860
I'm not kidding.
Even if that's not true,

765
00:34:33,861 --> 00:34:36,320
I liked that picture.
I like that image of him just in a shed,

766
00:34:36,321 --> 00:34:39,830
in a bond in the middle of nowhere.
And icy cold remaining true though.

767
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:42,100
Romania.
Lucifer?

768
00:34:42,170 --> 00:34:44,150
I breached Clinton server.
It was easy.

769
00:34:44,151 --> 00:34:45,590
Yeah.
So this guy,

770
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:49,370
he got arrested and he's in jail,
but the guy was set up the actual server

771
00:34:49,371 --> 00:34:50,001
itself,
by the way,

772
00:34:50,001 --> 00:34:52,700
which is in her bathroom.
Okay.

773
00:34:52,701 --> 00:34:54,620
What?
Why would you put a server in your

774
00:34:54,621 --> 00:34:55,454
bathroom?

775
00:34:55,490 --> 00:34:56,151
Exactly.
Okay.

776
00:34:56,151 --> 00:34:59,180
Who knows?
But that guy got immunity in this guy

777
00:34:59,181 --> 00:35:03,350
got so frustratingly paranoid.
Even if there was nothing,

778
00:35:03,410 --> 00:35:07,730
even if she wasn't doing anything wrong,
the fact that she's so paranoid as to

779
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:11,090
need to set that up because she's so
terrified that someone's going to get

780
00:35:11,091 --> 00:35:12,410
access to our emails.
Well,

781
00:35:12,411 --> 00:35:14,900
you know,
they spent a million dollars to fight

782
00:35:14,901 --> 00:35:17,780
off social media opinions.
Do you know about this?

783
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:23,000
Look at this.
The Pax correct commenters on Reddit and

784
00:35:23,001 --> 00:35:25,850
facebook.
A million dollars to spend a million

785
00:35:25,850 --> 00:35:28,550
dollars to fight off people that don't
like Clinton.

786
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,700
I mean they're what they're doing as a
trend of engineer public support,

787
00:35:31,770 --> 00:35:34,160
public support that Bernie sanders has
got organically.

788
00:35:34,161 --> 00:35:34,994
Yeah,
that'd be.

789
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:38,070
Trump has organically too.
Maybe we don't

790
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:38,670
know.
Well,

791
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:40,530
here's the thing.
What he does,

792
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,530
what he does have is even people who
hate him,

793
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:45,930
acknowledged that he is not full of
bullshit and that he's not being.

794
00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:49,440
He's not spending someone else's lines.
He doesn't seem manufactured.

795
00:35:49,441 --> 00:35:51,690
He's obviously not 100 conventional
politician.

796
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:54,960
I can dislike all of his policies as
much as I do,

797
00:35:54,961 --> 00:35:57,270
but I can still regard him as being a
breath of fresh air.

798
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:58,590
Hold on.
You don't like his policies.

799
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:02,760
What about the wall?
The Wall's great idea.

800
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:06,420
Are you a big pink floyd fan?
I am a pink floyd fan.

801
00:36:06,690 --> 00:36:09,060
Actually.
I don't think the wall is the craziest

802
00:36:09,061 --> 00:36:12,060
of is even close to his craziest of
ideas.

803
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:14,760
I mean the craziest.
Keeping Muslims out of the country and

804
00:36:14,761 --> 00:36:17,550
probably not allowing any noncitizen
Muslims into the United States.

805
00:36:17,551 --> 00:36:21,810
This is not only crazy but incredibly
dangerous because I think that if we

806
00:36:21,811 --> 00:36:26,160
want to be able to conquer a Islam,
Islam and jihadism,

807
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:29,400
Islamic terrorism,
we've got to find a way of.

808
00:36:29,450 --> 00:36:32,820
I mean our best resources and moderate
Muslims inside the United States,

809
00:36:32,821 --> 00:36:33,654
right?
Who can,

810
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:37,530
who have their ear to the ground,
who will notice mosques that might be

811
00:36:37,531 --> 00:36:40,920
becoming radicalized.
You want to appear to be a friendly,

812
00:36:41,970 --> 00:36:45,120
tolerant democracy and of course you
want to put in place all the security

813
00:36:45,121 --> 00:36:48,360
precautions that unnecessarily and you
don't want to just be allowing millions

814
00:36:48,361 --> 00:36:50,820
of,
of unscreened people to come pouring in

815
00:36:50,821 --> 00:36:53,460
the way that they have in Europe.
But we don't have that problem here

816
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:58,170
because we've got ocean between us so we
can pick and choose who was also why it

817
00:36:58,171 --> 00:37:02,730
gets really weird when you start talking
about the CIA and the CIA infiltrating

818
00:37:03,210 --> 00:37:05,820
different organizations.
It's like that's where you kind of

819
00:37:05,821 --> 00:37:08,970
support it.
Kinda support clan to Stein behavior and

820
00:37:08,971 --> 00:37:11,400
sneakiness and deception because
they're,

821
00:37:11,401 --> 00:37:13,830
they're pretty good at it.
They've been doing it for a long time

822
00:37:13,831 --> 00:37:17,490
and they know how to get deep into
organizations.

823
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:19,290
You know,
like you ever see the show homeland.

824
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:20,213
Yeah.
Come on Bro.

825
00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:23,010
Yeah,
I made a documentary.

826
00:37:23,170 --> 00:37:25,060
No.
Uh,

827
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:28,350
I mean the idea of a wall to me,
but I come from a country Australia

828
00:37:28,351 --> 00:37:30,030
which is surrounded.
It's an island.

829
00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:33,660
So like of course there are not that
like the idea of people just pouring

830
00:37:33,661 --> 00:37:38,580
across the border back and forth and
coming in for seasonal seasonal work and

831
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:41,730
like that to me does strike me as as
odd.

832
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:43,540
Yeah.
There's a.

833
00:37:43,610 --> 00:37:46,060
there's an undefended border.
I don't,

834
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:48,030
I don't think it would be a good
investment of money.

835
00:37:48,031 --> 00:37:49,800
I think it's silly.
I think it's a distraction.

836
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:52,830
If you talk to technology experts,
they say that there are much better ways

837
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:55,350
of securing the border than with a
physical wall.

838
00:37:55,680 --> 00:38:00,000
You can have drones and things and you
can have all kinds of crazy shit,

839
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:03,580
but because people will dig under a wall
of the climate over,

840
00:38:03,581 --> 00:38:04,440
well it's not,
it's not.

841
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:07,170
It's not nearly as sophisticated as the
kind of technology that you could use,

842
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:11,070
but I don't think there's anything
inherently like bigoted about it.

843
00:38:11,071 --> 00:38:15,990
I think deporting every single person
who's here illegally is an overreaction

844
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:18,270
and that like,
have you seen the stats about how many

845
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,250
seven?
40 seven is full of people.

846
00:38:20,251 --> 00:38:25,170
You would need to get all of all 11
million undocumented people in America.

847
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:28,200
There's more than 11 million in la by
the way,

848
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:31,560
this idea that there's 11 million
undocumented people in America,

849
00:38:31,561 --> 00:38:33,670
it's fucking hilarious.
Four,

850
00:38:33,690 --> 00:38:36,490
oh,
five at three the afternoon and look

851
00:38:36,491 --> 00:38:41,180
around because there's fucking millions
and millions of people that are broken

852
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:44,470
that are from Canada,
millions of people from Mexico,

853
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:47,440
millions of people from all sorts of
spots that aren't supposed to be here.

854
00:38:47,441 --> 00:38:50,780
That God visas and stayed.
That shit is rampant.

855
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:53,960
I know the bloody ozzy.
He's not to mention Monica,

856
00:38:54,330 --> 00:38:57,570
if you guys don't let anybody in
Australia either,

857
00:38:57,571 --> 00:39:00,140
like boatloads of people that try to get
come in legally,

858
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:02,860
that's spinning around,
light them on fire and push them out to

859
00:39:02,861 --> 00:39:06,340
the ocean
and people don't fucking play over

860
00:39:06,341 --> 00:39:06,590
there.

861
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:10,390
Australia Australia's policy has been
since the eighties that uh,

862
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:13,600
you have a heart,
a very high level of legal migration in

863
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:16,480
a high level of refugees.
Refugee intake,

864
00:39:16,481 --> 00:39:20,050
like on a per capita basis.
Australia is one of certainly the top 10

865
00:39:20,051 --> 00:39:23,020
most generous countries in terms of
people coming in and more than half of

866
00:39:23,021 --> 00:39:25,390
the population of Australia has arrived
since the Second World War.

867
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,290
Really?
Yup.

868
00:39:26,290 --> 00:39:29,520
So it's actually a higher immigrant
proportion country than the United

869
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:30,550
States,
even if you do it legally,

870
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:34,450
if you do it legally,
but we have this quite controversial and

871
00:39:34,451 --> 00:39:38,710
pretty inhumane,
but I suppose defensible policy,

872
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:42,220
which is if you pay a people smuggler to
make your way all the way from

873
00:39:42,221 --> 00:39:46,000
Afghanistan or Iran or wherever it is,
you're coming from Syria and you pass

874
00:39:46,001 --> 00:39:48,970
through a bazillion other different
countries through Malaysia,

875
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,520
through Singapore,
you make your way down to Indonesia and

876
00:39:51,521 --> 00:39:52,720
you're rich enough to get on a boat.

877
00:39:53,130 --> 00:39:56,110
Then comes to Australia.
You will never be settled in Australia.

878
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:57,760
Really?
You ever,

879
00:39:57,790 --> 00:39:58,360
ever,
ever,

880
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:01,810
never accepted,
and you'll be sent to a one of a couple

881
00:40:01,811 --> 00:40:04,270
of Pacific island nations.
There's a place called Manus island in

882
00:40:04,271 --> 00:40:05,530
Papua New Guinea,
I believe.

883
00:40:05,890 --> 00:40:08,350
There's another place called Naru,
which is a country in its own right,

884
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:12,970
and they have set up these big detention
centers there and people can end up

885
00:40:12,971 --> 00:40:15,790
there for years or even decades while
their cases get heard.

886
00:40:15,791 --> 00:40:18,580
It's really barbaric people,
so they're fucking lips together in

887
00:40:18,581 --> 00:40:20,650
protest.
One guy just set himself on fire in

888
00:40:20,651 --> 00:40:22,480
front of United Nations inspectors who
were there.

889
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:25,360
It's really not pretty stuff,
but the government says,

890
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:27,640
listen,
we used to have under the law,

891
00:40:27,641 --> 00:40:29,860
under the previous government which
relaxed these policies.

892
00:40:29,861 --> 00:40:33,070
50,000 people died at sea trying to get
to Australia in boats,

893
00:40:33,071 --> 00:40:36,070
including women and children.
Now almost nobody tries to come to

894
00:40:36,071 --> 00:40:38,380
Australia by boat anymore because they
know they're never going to settle,

895
00:40:38,590 --> 00:40:39,520
so what do you prefer?

896
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:44,200
A few hundred people basically being
stuck in indefinite detention on some

897
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:48,370
shitty Pacific island or 50,000 people
dying at sea trying to get here because

898
00:40:48,371 --> 00:40:49,480
they think they're going to be
resettled.

899
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:53,560
Plus Australia remains awesome.
That's where it gets weird.

900
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:58,120
It's pretty fucking bad ass there.
So if you're trying to like look at the

901
00:40:58,150 --> 00:41:00,450
end result might go,
man,

902
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:03,130
the result might justify the means
because like go to Melbourne.

903
00:41:03,131 --> 00:41:04,480
It's fucking beautiful.
It's great.

904
00:41:04,510 --> 00:41:05,530
It's incredible.
Yeah.

905
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:09,580
It's like paradise.
There's this thing about Australia that

906
00:41:09,581 --> 00:41:10,890
to me it's like,
Ooh,

907
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:13,780
they might have it nailed.
There's only 20 million people in the

908
00:41:13,781 --> 00:41:16,390
entire country.
It's a fucking huge country.

909
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:19,690
The landscape is gorgeous.
You don't have any ozone layer though.

910
00:41:19,970 --> 00:41:20,890
No,
that's the problem.

911
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:23,920
You Get Sun burnt and you get cancer
into.

912
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:26,560
Yeah.
Know Australia has 23 million people,

913
00:41:26,561 --> 00:41:28,690
so what's that?
About half the population of California.

914
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:30,550
California is about $40.
That's La.

915
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:33,010
Yeah.
So the greater the greater la area if

916
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:35,270
you,
if you include all the way up through

917
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:35,561
and.
Yeah.

918
00:41:35,561 --> 00:41:37,220
Yeah.
And down to down to long beach and all

919
00:41:37,221 --> 00:41:38,620
that.
Uh,

920
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:41,900
and that's in,
that's in an area the same size as the

921
00:41:41,901 --> 00:41:44,150
contiguous United States.
Crazy.

922
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:45,920
And everybody lives in the edge.
Yeah,

923
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:50,370
the middle one.
The middle of crocodiles and Lizard.

924
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,860
Kangaroos and nuts,
man.

925
00:41:52,870 --> 00:41:54,190
It's crazy place.
Yeah.

926
00:41:54,230 --> 00:41:57,080
But Canada is kind of like that.
Canada's only got 35 million people and

927
00:41:57,081 --> 00:41:59,330
it's bigger than the United States even
including Alaska,

928
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:03,620
but it's fucking frozen my good time yet
it's the site of Canada and Australia.

929
00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:06,470
Kind of very similar in that they're
enormous,

930
00:42:06,530 --> 00:42:08,360
but totally in hospitable.
I mean,

931
00:42:08,361 --> 00:42:10,400
you could know sooner live in most parts
of Canada,

932
00:42:10,401 --> 00:42:13,250
then you could live in most parts of
Australia where there's just no water

933
00:42:13,251 --> 00:42:16,010
and no vegetation in Australia was
desert Canada is ice,

934
00:42:16,490 --> 00:42:17,630
not really icy.

935
00:42:17,630 --> 00:42:21,710
Probably be better off trying Australia
then you would see I'm going to try and

936
00:42:21,711 --> 00:42:22,990
Canada.
Then you would Australia definitely.

937
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,410
Well you could,
you could get water,

938
00:42:24,411 --> 00:42:27,470
you could make fires and stuff pulling.
If there's no water you're screwed.

939
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:29,420
Right.
But there's a lot of people that live

940
00:42:29,421 --> 00:42:30,950
like.
I have some friends that live in

941
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:33,110
Alberta.
They live way up there.

942
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:36,230
They live in.
It's fucking cold shit.

943
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:37,940
The wintertime up,
there's like 30,

944
00:42:37,941 --> 00:42:38,840
40,
below zero.

945
00:42:38,870 --> 00:42:40,430
I mean he's crazy,
but they live there.

946
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:44,930
They're fine
with modern civilization I suppose.

947
00:42:45,070 --> 00:42:45,903
Yeah.
Yeah.

948
00:42:46,250 --> 00:42:47,780
And the other thing,
the best writer in Kennedy is,

949
00:42:47,781 --> 00:42:49,550
as you say,
we all huddle along a very,

950
00:42:49,551 --> 00:42:53,120
very narrow strip in Australia.
It's the coast and in Canada it's the

951
00:42:53,121 --> 00:42:53,780
border.

952
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:57,380
Don't you think it's easier though to
live in a cold climate then in

953
00:42:57,381 --> 00:42:59,870
hospitably hot climate?
Because you could dress for a cold

954
00:42:59,871 --> 00:43:02,800
climate who can get in your car,
you drive around you all right?

955
00:43:02,810 --> 00:43:04,040
You get in your house.
It's warm,

956
00:43:04,430 --> 00:43:08,930
but hot climates are fucking scary.
Like it gets too hot to survive outside

957
00:43:08,931 --> 00:43:10,460
for whatever reason.
That's waste,

958
00:43:10,461 --> 00:43:12,140
Gary,
because you can't dress for it.

959
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:15,680
Like you could wear like really
insulated close and you can actually

960
00:43:15,681 --> 00:43:18,820
stand outside at 10 below.
But you grew up in the northeast.

961
00:43:18,870 --> 00:43:21,410
Right?
But if you're outside and it's 130

962
00:43:21,411 --> 00:43:23,120
degrees outside,
you're fuck.

963
00:43:23,410 --> 00:43:25,780
I feel like this is just.
This just comes from what you're used

964
00:43:25,781 --> 00:43:27,100
to.
I reckon because you grew up in the

965
00:43:27,110 --> 00:43:29,880
northeast,
you're not as scared of the call.

966
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:30,501
I've,
I,

967
00:43:30,501 --> 00:43:32,920
I find like when I first moved to New
York,

968
00:43:32,921 --> 00:43:34,810
I remember saying to people back in
Australia,

969
00:43:36,290 --> 00:43:38,520
why is there even a city here?
Why?

970
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:43,090
Why did anyone ever come across the
ocean and build a fucking city here

971
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:47,920
where it's literally so cold that a
dog's piss on the sidewalk will turn

972
00:43:47,921 --> 00:43:49,540
into ice.
It's like,

973
00:43:49,541 --> 00:43:51,400
um,
it's like I'm in the TV show the dome

974
00:43:51,610 --> 00:43:55,090
and it's just a giant freezer.
Because I'd never had the conception of

975
00:43:55,091 --> 00:43:58,600
actually being sub freezing like shit is
just freezing.

976
00:43:58,780 --> 00:44:02,320
You should not be living anywhere where
if you fell over drunk at night and hit

977
00:44:02,321 --> 00:44:04,510
your head,
you would be dead by the morning.

978
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:08,110
But then again we get rid of some
dummies.

979
00:44:09,330 --> 00:44:12,760
Should we send her a little bit?
You know if you're falling asleep out in

980
00:44:12,770 --> 00:44:15,210
the street drunk.
I mean it's sad when that happens to

981
00:44:15,211 --> 00:44:16,770
people.
You hear about it with like college

982
00:44:16,771 --> 00:44:17,820
kids,
they freeze to death.

983
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:21,660
That happens like every other year.
So some college kid in New Hampshire

984
00:44:21,661 --> 00:44:24,090
will get drunk,
fall asleep outside and freeze to death.

985
00:44:24,190 --> 00:44:25,690
Shouldn't be living there.
Don't do it.

986
00:44:25,930 --> 00:44:30,130
Move all of Canada and the North East
down to the mid Atlantic states and be

987
00:44:30,131 --> 00:44:31,470
done with.
It's not though.

988
00:44:31,471 --> 00:44:32,250
If you have warm

989
00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:34,020
clothes,
if you have warm clothes you could

990
00:44:34,030 --> 00:44:35,640
survive up there.
It's not that bad.

991
00:44:35,670 --> 00:44:37,140
Well,
I mean if you have air conditioning,

992
00:44:37,230 --> 00:44:39,300
you can even live in Phoenix.
But sub,

993
00:44:39,301 --> 00:44:41,520
no,
but sub zero temperatures,

994
00:44:41,521 --> 00:44:43,740
like if it's zero outside,
you can walk around,

995
00:44:43,741 --> 00:44:46,620
you can go places like if it's 130
degrees outside,

996
00:44:46,621 --> 00:44:47,454
you can't go anywhere.

997
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:49,950
That's true.
You can only go places when it's

998
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:52,390
subfreezing.
I have been swimming,

999
00:44:52,391 --> 00:44:57,370
my sister in law is finish and in
Finland they go in the Saunas and then

1000
00:44:57,371 --> 00:45:01,180
they'd go out and swim in lakes in the
middle of nowhere when it is minus 22

1001
00:45:01,181 --> 00:45:04,540
degrees.
I've been swimming in a lake when it's

1002
00:45:04,541 --> 00:45:07,420
minus 22 degrees,
the whole thing is frozen over God.

1003
00:45:07,421 --> 00:45:08,620
They just chip a hole in it.
Yeah.

1004
00:45:08,621 --> 00:45:10,060
Then I didn't need to chip it.
They uh,

1005
00:45:10,061 --> 00:45:13,000
they have a whole like add water spouts
so the water keeps moving.

1006
00:45:13,001 --> 00:45:15,160
So
uh,

1007
00:45:15,190 --> 00:45:16,470
and uh,
I made,

1008
00:45:16,471 --> 00:45:19,810
maybe they stopped by chipping it,
but it's basically like a bubbling cold

1009
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:21,670
pool.
And you sit in the sauna,

1010
00:45:21,671 --> 00:45:23,170
which is,
you know,

1011
00:45:23,171 --> 00:45:25,290
it's,
it's nudging 100 degrees Celsius.

1012
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:26,260
I don't know what that is.
200,

1013
00:45:26,630 --> 00:45:31,060
200 degrees Fahrenheit or something.
And then you come out through the air,

1014
00:45:31,061 --> 00:45:35,230
which is minus 20 Fahrenheit,
I think it crosses Fahrenheit and

1015
00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:37,540
Celsius crossover around it in the low
minus twenties.

1016
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:39,970
And then you get in the water,
you can't put your head under

1017
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:41,710
[inaudible].
You can go into this condition where

1018
00:45:41,711 --> 00:45:43,780
you,
your brain essentially shuts down and

1019
00:45:43,781 --> 00:45:46,400
goes into phrase.
But uh,

1020
00:45:46,490 --> 00:45:47,323
yeah,
there,

1021
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:51,760
the people in Finland,
they love it so that it looks like they

1022
00:45:51,761 --> 00:45:52,730
cut a hole in the ice.
Yeah.

1023
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:54,030
That looks like they got a hole in
layoffs.

1024
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:56,200
But that's not me.
If you got to my facebook and probably

1025
00:45:56,201 --> 00:45:57,790
find it back there somewhere in the
deep,

1026
00:45:57,791 --> 00:45:59,140
dark and distant.
Pam.

1027
00:45:59,650 --> 00:46:00,250
Yeah.

1028
00:46:00,250 --> 00:46:01,470
Yeah.
Well people loved that.

1029
00:46:01,471 --> 00:46:05,010
That ice cold ice cold going back and
forth between the two of them is

1030
00:46:05,020 --> 00:46:06,280
amazing.
It gives you a high.

1031
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:09,310
The does well,
it actually really does actually

1032
00:46:09,311 --> 00:46:11,320
produces certain chemicals in your
brain.

1033
00:46:11,770 --> 00:46:13,990
Epinephrin.
So what is norepinephrine?

1034
00:46:14,020 --> 00:46:15,580
Norepinephrine?
I'll believe you.

1035
00:46:15,610 --> 00:46:18,190
I'm Dr Rhonda.
Patrick was on.

1036
00:46:18,191 --> 00:46:19,370
She was talking about,
um,

1037
00:46:19,420 --> 00:46:23,500
cold shock therapy,
cold shock proteins and heat shock

1038
00:46:23,501 --> 00:46:26,120
proteins and that there's a different,
um,

1039
00:46:26,740 --> 00:46:30,310
there's different proteins that we
produce in the sauna and the sauna is

1040
00:46:30,311 --> 00:46:32,410
really beneficial for hormone
production,

1041
00:46:32,411 --> 00:46:34,300
for sleep,
Melatonin production,

1042
00:46:34,301 --> 00:46:37,000
all sorts of different things.
Things Melatonin might not have been,

1043
00:46:37,540 --> 00:46:39,420
but all sorts of growth hormone for
sure.

1044
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:42,400
That was one of them.
But things that rejuvenate the body

1045
00:46:42,460 --> 00:46:44,220
produced by these heat shock protein.

1046
00:46:44,230 --> 00:46:45,340
I mean,
just look at the nordic,

1047
00:46:45,341 --> 00:46:49,540
paypal and paypal in northern Germany.
They will swear by soreness I mean the

1048
00:46:49,541 --> 00:46:52,600
Swedes and the Norwegians and the Finns
and the Danes.

1049
00:46:52,660 --> 00:46:54,940
I mean,
it's not like these are not people who

1050
00:46:54,941 --> 00:46:56,050
you'd want to emulate.
These

1051
00:46:56,050 --> 00:46:57,550
are very attractive,
healthy,

1052
00:46:57,551 --> 00:46:58,960
long living people.
Yeah,

1053
00:46:58,970 --> 00:47:03,010
they're robust yet,
but I think there's definitely something

1054
00:47:03,011 --> 00:47:05,650
to it,
to both sauna and cold baths.

1055
00:47:05,651 --> 00:47:07,810
Like you know,
when Hoff know Wim Hof,

1056
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:13,260
Wim Hoff method of breathing and he's
got something like 26 world records.

1057
00:47:13,391 --> 00:47:16,060
She's been on the podcast for 2:26 world
records,

1058
00:47:16,061 --> 00:47:20,860
but like dealing with climate and cold,
he summited everest in his shorts with

1059
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:22,780
ice sandals on.
I'm not even kidding.

1060
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:24,550
No,
no oxygen.

1061
00:47:24,551 --> 00:47:27,400
Didn't bring any oxygen with them is a
maniac.

1062
00:47:27,490 --> 00:47:29,950
Crazy.
But he's developed ability to

1063
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:35,010
tolerate extreme temperature distance or
a temperature changes and he swears by

1064
00:47:35,771 --> 00:47:38,470
it.
He thinks it's a great teacher about

1065
00:47:38,471 --> 00:47:42,430
life and who you are and what you are
and just invigorates you in some strange

1066
00:47:42,431 --> 00:47:43,500
way that.
I mean,

1067
00:47:43,510 --> 00:47:45,220
when you meet the guy,
you believe it because he's like

1068
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:47,050
radiating energy.
Yeah.

1069
00:47:47,530 --> 00:47:48,880
It's funny what people.
I mean it's like Tim,

1070
00:47:48,910 --> 00:47:50,050
Tim Ferris as well,
right?

1071
00:47:50,051 --> 00:47:50,471
Where he,
he,

1072
00:47:50,471 --> 00:47:53,590
he'll go through periods where he's
taken my spots and doing all this crazy

1073
00:47:53,591 --> 00:47:56,410
shit and measuring the impact that it
has on his physiology.

1074
00:47:56,411 --> 00:47:58,150
And I'm just too lazy,
man.

1075
00:47:58,230 --> 00:47:59,660
I think.
Wow.

1076
00:48:01,390 --> 00:48:02,830
I can't talk to you anymore.
I'm sorry.

1077
00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:06,190
Sorry.
Yeah,

1078
00:48:06,191 --> 00:48:07,620
I understand man.
Did you say the,

1079
00:48:07,630 --> 00:48:09,790
um,
just say the Philadelphia conference

1080
00:48:09,791 --> 00:48:10,601
that I,
that I sent you,

1081
00:48:10,601 --> 00:48:11,890
which was about,
uh,

1082
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:14,710
about what people's guilt.
I'm guilty.

1083
00:48:14,711 --> 00:48:16,630
I'm guilty.
What did I do?

1084
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:17,630
It was a,
it was white.

1085
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:19,270
There was a white privileged conference.

1086
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:20,313
Oh,
that's right.

1087
00:48:20,570 --> 00:48:23,030
I love that article at that because we
did this.

1088
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:24,701
I'm sure.
Yeah.

1089
00:48:24,701 --> 00:48:25,460
Yeah,
you did.

1090
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:26,900
I was like,
why is my twitter blowing up?

1091
00:48:26,930 --> 00:48:28,040
Oh,
Joe retweeted me.

1092
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:31,610
So there was this white privileged
conference,

1093
00:48:32,330 --> 00:48:34,790
which was a kind of politically correct
talk fast.

1094
00:48:34,791 --> 00:48:38,450
Right.
And it basically ended up consuming

1095
00:48:38,451 --> 00:48:41,480
itself entirely because the people who
were attending it decided that the

1096
00:48:41,481 --> 00:48:45,030
conference itself had become too white.
So they were getting,

1097
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:47,240
they were all there.
So they had this Hashtag.

1098
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:51,230
I'm white privileged conference,
so white WPC,

1099
00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:52,920
so white.
Uh,

1100
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:56,960
and it started after one of the speakers
there who was a white historian,

1101
00:48:57,220 --> 00:49:00,830
uh,
went overtime and won an Asian American,

1102
00:49:00,860 --> 00:49:04,160
attend a,
a woman tweeted out great keynote,

1103
00:49:04,190 --> 00:49:07,820
but going over time allotted is another
example of white supremacy,

1104
00:49:09,490 --> 00:49:11,740
Hashtag white privilege conference so
wise.

1105
00:49:12,810 --> 00:49:14,550
And he also made the mistake of using
the

1106
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:17,400
inward in his speech.
I mean he obviously was using it in a

1107
00:49:17,401 --> 00:49:19,980
historical context because he was
talking about race in America.

1108
00:49:19,981 --> 00:49:22,230
But once that happened,
I mean,

1109
00:49:22,231 --> 00:49:25,350
what could possibly go wrong using the
inward at a conference about white

1110
00:49:25,351 --> 00:49:26,184
guilt,
right?

1111
00:49:26,190 --> 00:49:27,360
Then everyone starts tweeting

1112
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:32,950
would never acceptable from Hashtag
white folks lips deeply offensive and

1113
00:49:32,951 --> 00:49:35,560
traumatizing.
Hashtag white privilege conference.

1114
00:49:35,561 --> 00:49:37,750
So white.
And that was from a white Tweeta.

1115
00:49:37,751 --> 00:49:40,360
So then it's like a snake eating its
fucking title.

1116
00:49:40,361 --> 00:49:42,880
Right?
All these white people just accusing one

1117
00:49:42,881 --> 00:49:45,180
another of being too white.
You're all whites.

1118
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:47,020
We get it.
We get it.

1119
00:49:47,380 --> 00:49:49,780
It's would Michael Shermer calls virtue
signaling,

1120
00:49:50,110 --> 00:49:51,070
right?
Yeah.

1121
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:51,911
Right.
That's there.

1122
00:49:51,911 --> 00:49:56,911
They're letting the perfect term there.
They're trying to find someone who's

1123
00:49:57,341 --> 00:50:02,320
made some sort of an error.
They're attacking them with full force.

1124
00:50:02,390 --> 00:50:05,560
Yep.
And it's also like they're ignoring

1125
00:50:05,561 --> 00:50:09,630
context on purpose.
It's like by saying that the word is,

1126
00:50:09,631 --> 00:50:14,140
it's never acceptable to say the n word.
By saying that and putting that in a

1127
00:50:14,141 --> 00:50:16,180
tweet,
that's not true.

1128
00:50:16,460 --> 00:50:20,440
It's just not true.
Like if there is a reason to say it,

1129
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:23,260
if you were explaining something that
happened,

1130
00:50:23,261 --> 00:50:25,690
what someone said,
how they said it,

1131
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:27,680
you are allowed to repeat word.

1132
00:50:27,830 --> 00:50:31,010
The idea that you're not allowed to
repeat the word around grown adults is

1133
00:50:31,011 --> 00:50:34,820
to pretend that word is magic to where
that going to conjure demon,

1134
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:36,680
but it also empowers the word I,
in fact,

1135
00:50:36,681 --> 00:50:39,260
I feel stupid for even having used the
phrase the anyway because ordinarily I'd

1136
00:50:39,261 --> 00:50:39,761
just say,
Nigga,

1137
00:50:39,761 --> 00:50:42,920
if I'm talking about the existence of
that would shock the podcast on

1138
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:45,230
Australian so I don't understand
context.

1139
00:50:45,231 --> 00:50:46,670
Right?
But I mean,

1140
00:50:46,730 --> 00:50:49,670
I was talking about this on my podcast
about.

1141
00:50:49,940 --> 00:50:53,240
I do think that we,
we've gotten away from like where is the

1142
00:50:53,241 --> 00:50:55,250
other person's heart and what is their
intention?

1143
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:57,890
So like if you ever use that word in
anger,

1144
00:50:58,180 --> 00:51:01,010
add another person.
I think your total count and you should

1145
00:51:01,011 --> 00:51:03,980
not do that or you're running a nigger.

1146
00:51:06,810 --> 00:51:08,510
That's true.
Mean that gentleman,

1147
00:51:08,570 --> 00:51:10,430
I couldn't help it as a stand up
comedian in me,

1148
00:51:10,590 --> 00:51:11,423
but uh,
but,

1149
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:14,180
but if you're just using it in
conversation in order to talk about the

1150
00:51:14,181 --> 00:51:17,150
existence of the wood,
we know that though everyone knows that.

1151
00:51:17,151 --> 00:51:20,930
And I think it's a tough thing.
Here's the problem with a lot of these,

1152
00:51:21,110 --> 00:51:24,500
these things where you attack someone's
use of a word,

1153
00:51:24,890 --> 00:51:28,010
it's Duh.
It becomes one of those things like if

1154
00:51:28,011 --> 00:51:31,130
someone says sexism is bad,
racism is system is bad,

1155
00:51:31,370 --> 00:51:36,170
we need to be a more integrated and
complete and whole culture and society

1156
00:51:36,171 --> 00:51:38,660
and we need to look at each other for
like Martin Luther King said,

1157
00:51:38,661 --> 00:51:40,730
the content of their character,
not the color of their skin.

1158
00:51:40,970 --> 00:51:43,070
Isn't that Dha at a certain point in
time,

1159
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:47,360
some people think that it's not dark
enough in enough places with enough

1160
00:51:47,361 --> 00:51:49,850
people,
but we're going to educate racists or we

1161
00:51:49,851 --> 00:51:52,610
just gonna toot our own horn as to how
non racist we are.

1162
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:54,590
Right?
The latter.

1163
00:51:54,860 --> 00:51:57,350
Because another one of the tweets that
happened at this conference.

1164
00:51:57,560 --> 00:52:00,350
What red?
A white woman telling a black woman to

1165
00:52:00,351 --> 00:52:04,490
close the door at a workshop session.
Another example of Hashtag white

1166
00:52:04,491 --> 00:52:05,690
privileged conference.
So what?

1167
00:52:05,780 --> 00:52:08,690
You're not allowed to tell a person of
color to do anything.

1168
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:10,340
No charges eps.
That's right.

1169
00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:13,460
Even gentle little flowers to just leave
the water running.

1170
00:52:13,990 --> 00:52:16,490
Just whatever you're allowed to say,
hey,

1171
00:52:16,790 --> 00:52:18,040
can you shut that water off?
No,

1172
00:52:18,050 --> 00:52:19,190
that's racist.
Oh,

1173
00:52:19,191 --> 00:52:20,500
okay.
Um,

1174
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:24,290
what if they just throw lit cigarettes
on the ground outside?

1175
00:52:24,291 --> 00:52:27,110
Are you allowed to correct them or.
No?

1176
00:52:27,111 --> 00:52:28,340
That's racist.
Racist.

1177
00:52:28,550 --> 00:52:29,630
Okay.
What if,

1178
00:52:29,631 --> 00:52:32,540
um,
let's just spend the whole rest of the

1179
00:52:32,541 --> 00:52:35,720
Puc house going through hypothetical
anecdotes about what would be,

1180
00:52:35,980 --> 00:52:40,980
what would very strange that there is a
word that certain people are allowed to

1181
00:52:41,361 --> 00:52:43,730
use.
Like the black people can use it and

1182
00:52:43,731 --> 00:52:46,010
they can even use it as a form of
empowerment,

1183
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:47,960
but I think that's okay,
isn't it?

1184
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:49,560
Do you think that's hypocritical?
I reckon if you,

1185
00:52:50,020 --> 00:52:52,280
I reckon if you will,
people in your ancestors have been

1186
00:52:52,281 --> 00:52:54,110
fucked over completely full hundred
years,

1187
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:57,590
then it's a little bit rich when the,
when the people who belong to the

1188
00:52:57,591 --> 00:53:02,591
ethnicity that's been fucking you over,
don't let you reclaim the wood that was

1189
00:53:02,691 --> 00:53:03,780
previously oppressive.
Oh,

1190
00:53:03,781 --> 00:53:04,970
100 percent.
Not only that,

1191
00:53:04,990 --> 00:53:09,530
it in practice it seems correct when
it's being done.

1192
00:53:09,610 --> 00:53:12,350
Yeah.
Like if a white person uses the word and

1193
00:53:12,351 --> 00:53:15,050
they use it for me,
even me just using it in that joke,

1194
00:53:15,051 --> 00:53:17,780
just joking around and what have you
done?

1195
00:53:17,781 --> 00:53:18,790
Yeah.
It,

1196
00:53:18,860 --> 00:53:21,560
you know,
it's a joke and it still impacts and

1197
00:53:21,561 --> 00:53:25,500
some sort of a very bizarre way.
But if a rapper is using it,

1198
00:53:25,770 --> 00:53:27,230
it seems like,
like,

1199
00:53:27,390 --> 00:53:29,460
like someone saying,
you know,

1200
00:53:29,820 --> 00:53:31,260
like,
you know what I'm saying man,

1201
00:53:31,270 --> 00:53:32,320
you know,
you know,

1202
00:53:32,740 --> 00:53:33,450
it's become that.

1203
00:53:33,450 --> 00:53:35,850
But it was subversive when black people
started saying.

1204
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:36,753
Right,
right,

1205
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:39,300
right.
But my point being a white person saying

1206
00:53:39,301 --> 00:53:43,200
the exact same things as horrific and
shocking that stitches guy,

1207
00:53:43,530 --> 00:53:46,380
stitches guy likes that word.
He throws the word around all the time.

1208
00:53:46,381 --> 00:53:47,730
I'll bet he does.
Doesn't surprise me at all.

1209
00:53:48,270 --> 00:53:49,500
Yeah,
no nuts on him.

1210
00:53:49,530 --> 00:53:51,430
That's not him.
Stitches to run with the joker.

1211
00:53:51,670 --> 00:53:52,140
Yeah,
yeah,

1212
00:53:52,140 --> 00:53:53,690
yeah.
You gotta get your white people straight

1213
00:53:54,060 --> 00:53:55,170
out of the birds.
The Black Guy,

1214
00:53:55,171 --> 00:53:58,220
that's Gucci Mane.
He uses it to assist.

1215
00:53:58,290 --> 00:54:00,660
I just mistook a white person for black
fests are amazing.

1216
00:54:00,661 --> 00:54:03,090
I don't even see color president too
bad.

1217
00:54:03,091 --> 00:54:05,430
You were born and some other shit hole
and you were born here.

1218
00:54:05,431 --> 00:54:06,990
You could have a fucking real good run
at it.

1219
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:10,710
I'm just not good enough.
I can't do that.

1220
00:54:10,711 --> 00:54:13,710
Can't do what trump does.
I look at that admiringly.

1221
00:54:13,710 --> 00:54:16,560
I'm like,
how does he have the Bulls?

1222
00:54:16,561 --> 00:54:18,720
The audacity,
which you wouldn't do it that way.

1223
00:54:18,810 --> 00:54:20,310
No.
One of the things that I think is

1224
00:54:20,311 --> 00:54:24,600
fascinating about trump and really
problematic is that human beings love to

1225
00:54:24,601 --> 00:54:28,830
be united in tribes and not necessarily
always good tribes.

1226
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:33,030
We love to be united in tribes and
whether it's tribes of people who use

1227
00:54:33,031 --> 00:54:37,670
Mac over windows,
whether it's tribes of android users or

1228
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:41,850
it's tribes of people from Wisconsin
versus tribes from people from Texas.

1229
00:54:42,060 --> 00:54:45,210
We love to be in a fucking collective
group of people,

1230
00:54:45,690 --> 00:54:48,900
even if it's not a good group,
even if it's not good ideas,

1231
00:54:49,110 --> 00:54:52,980
and one of the things that I get
disturbed about what this trump thing

1232
00:54:53,490 --> 00:54:57,150
is,
how many annoying goofy white dudes are

1233
00:54:57,151 --> 00:55:01,110
really into him.
There's like there's an anti

1234
00:55:01,111 --> 00:55:06,111
intellectual aspect that got shut down,
debate aspect about this.

1235
00:55:06,420 --> 00:55:07,050
Yeah.

1236
00:55:07,050 --> 00:55:10,060
I think there's a lot of that being
sarcastic because it goes cultural

1237
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:12,790
Australian to trump's support.
Not all of us.

1238
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:14,700
It's not a,
there's intelligent people that support

1239
00:55:14,701 --> 00:55:17,940
them to totally but then not supporting
him because he,

1240
00:55:17,970 --> 00:55:20,550
his ideas are intelligent.
They're supporting him in spite of the

1241
00:55:20,551 --> 00:55:23,040
fact that they're intelligent because
there's something about his vibe that

1242
00:55:23,041 --> 00:55:25,620
appeals.
I feel like there's a bunch of people

1243
00:55:25,621 --> 00:55:29,940
supporting him cause he's winning and
they want to see him win and they want

1244
00:55:29,941 --> 00:55:33,570
to get in on some of that winning and
there's a bunch of dumb white dudes that

1245
00:55:33,571 --> 00:55:37,140
are hopping aboard that,
that are just letting you know who's

1246
00:55:37,220 --> 00:55:38,340
winning.
He's winning,

1247
00:55:38,730 --> 00:55:40,140
winning.
I think it's partly that.

1248
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:42,990
I think it's partly exhaustion with the
political correctness that we've just

1249
00:55:42,991 --> 00:55:44,880
been talking about.
I just think that they feel like they

1250
00:55:44,881 --> 00:55:49,650
can't say anything about the threat of
Islamist terrorism or about the changing

1251
00:55:49,651 --> 00:55:53,160
demographics of America or illegal
immigration without being branded as a

1252
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:54,000
bigot.

1253
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:57,360
And I think it's also just what I was
saying before about him seeming

1254
00:55:57,361 --> 00:55:59,610
refreshing.
Like it's the same back in Australia.

1255
00:55:59,611 --> 00:56:01,140
I was back in Australia,
uh,

1256
00:56:01,250 --> 00:56:05,280
about six weeks ago and I was on a panel
there and they were asking me about

1257
00:56:05,340 --> 00:56:07,200
trump,
like the audience asks questions and

1258
00:56:07,201 --> 00:56:11,790
stuff and I was trying to explain it by
reference to the fact that even in

1259
00:56:11,791 --> 00:56:14,340
Australia,
people don't feel like politicians are

1260
00:56:14,341 --> 00:56:18,440
speaking their language,
like actual human beings and are like,

1261
00:56:18,450 --> 00:56:20,190
take for example,
gay marriage in Australia.

1262
00:56:20,191 --> 00:56:23,190
Australia still doesn't have gay
marriage.

1263
00:56:23,470 --> 00:56:25,420
You should be psyched about that.
You don't have to give away half your

1264
00:56:25,421 --> 00:56:28,330
money.
Sorry honey.

1265
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:30,670
Can't do it.
I'd love to marry you.

1266
00:56:31,030 --> 00:56:33,190
Shit ain't happening.
I'd be fucking pumped.

1267
00:56:33,191 --> 00:56:35,560
Tax Laws are different though.
It's actually better to be married in

1268
00:56:35,561 --> 00:56:38,170
Australia than it is not to be married.
It's not like here where they screw you.

1269
00:56:38,230 --> 00:56:39,940
How's that?
Not An understanding that someone's

1270
00:56:39,941 --> 00:56:40,920
going to take care of your shit.
No,

1271
00:56:40,930 --> 00:56:42,700
it's not good.
If you get divorced,

1272
00:56:42,701 --> 00:56:44,290
they're going to take off.
You don't want.

1273
00:56:44,580 --> 00:56:47,800
That's what I'm saying.
Fuck taxes.

1274
00:56:48,550 --> 00:56:49,383
Don't worry about that.

1275
00:56:49,510 --> 00:56:50,420
So,
uh,

1276
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:52,990
the,
the Australia is one of the most pro gay

1277
00:56:52,991 --> 00:56:56,320
marriage places in the world when you
actually poll people 70 slash 80 percent

1278
00:56:56,321 --> 00:56:58,330
of the population wants gay marriage.
Uh,

1279
00:56:58,510 --> 00:57:00,670
it's one of the least religious
countries in the world when you poll

1280
00:57:00,671 --> 00:57:03,940
people and more than 60 percent of the
population don't believe in God or go to

1281
00:57:03,941 --> 00:57:07,120
church regularly.
The last prime minister,

1282
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:10,120
the prime minister before last was an
unmarried atheist woman.

1283
00:57:10,570 --> 00:57:13,510
So it's not like this is a place where
you would expect people to be opposed to

1284
00:57:13,540 --> 00:57:14,210
gay marriage.

1285
00:57:14,210 --> 00:57:16,030
I bet what's going on?
I Bet I get it.

1286
00:57:16,310 --> 00:57:20,570
I bet gay dudes are secretly going and
voting against gay marriage so they

1287
00:57:20,571 --> 00:57:21,800
don't have to get married.
That's it.

1288
00:57:21,801 --> 00:57:24,800
I think that's what it is.
I think it's like these pot dealers up

1289
00:57:24,801 --> 00:57:28,580
in northern California that secretly
voted against marijuana legalization

1290
00:57:28,581 --> 00:57:30,860
because he wanted to keep it illegal so
they can make more money and they

1291
00:57:30,861 --> 00:57:33,830
wouldn't have to turn in the taxes.
That's shrewd.

1292
00:57:33,890 --> 00:57:36,440
It's dirty,
it's dirty and it's prevalent.

1293
00:57:36,441 --> 00:57:39,500
I talked to some growers that were
telling me they were going to vote

1294
00:57:39,501 --> 00:57:41,030
against it,
that we're going to vote against

1295
00:57:41,031 --> 00:57:44,000
legalization because legalization would
fuck them over economically,

1296
00:57:44,001 --> 00:57:46,330
and I know I'm being selfish,
but hey man,

1297
00:57:46,331 --> 00:57:47,240
it's so we do it up here.

1298
00:57:47,990 --> 00:57:49,790
I mean,
do you think the Mexican drug cartels

1299
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:52,790
one end to the war on drugs Helena
course them.

1300
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:53,673
It's good.
Why would you?

1301
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:56,960
Why would you?
But my point is simply that the prime

1302
00:57:56,961 --> 00:57:59,330
minister of Australia currently favors
gay marriage.

1303
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:02,360
The palate,
there's a majority in parliament for it

1304
00:58:02,361 --> 00:58:06,320
and instead because he had to do some
shady backroom deal to get into power

1305
00:58:06,890 --> 00:58:10,470
with his fellow party hacks,
there's gonna.

1306
00:58:10,490 --> 00:58:12,740
They're not doing it now.
There's going to be like a plebiscite,

1307
00:58:12,741 --> 00:58:16,040
which is like a nonbinding referendum
about it or something and all my only

1308
00:58:16,041 --> 00:58:20,590
point was it's so obvious that
politicians are so full of shit and that

1309
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:23,420
they are beholden to people other than
the people who elected them.

1310
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:26,030
That whether,
whether you're listening to Ted Cruz or

1311
00:58:26,031 --> 00:58:28,670
Hillary Clinton,
people just have a sense that they're

1312
00:58:28,671 --> 00:58:32,870
being fed lines.
Did you hear Hillary talking about after

1313
00:58:32,871 --> 00:58:34,730
trump,
huge group playing the Women's card?

1314
00:58:35,060 --> 00:58:36,350
She goes,
you know,

1315
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:39,380
fat playing the Woman's Card,
Dubbo,

1316
00:58:39,410 --> 00:58:43,050
lame and weak while pay and

1317
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:45,460
what?
Nobody speaks like that.

1318
00:58:45,490 --> 00:58:50,050
Why are you speaking like that?
Why you sound like like that so I can

1319
00:58:50,051 --> 00:58:51,420
understand.
I can imagine people going,

1320
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:53,080
we'll get lists.
It's

1321
00:58:53,110 --> 00:58:56,280
so gross hearing that it's so gross.
First of all,

1322
00:58:56,281 --> 00:58:59,550
she was a person who said that marriage
should be between a man and a woman

1323
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:02,250
until 2013.
Okay.

1324
00:59:02,251 --> 00:59:05,760
Two thousand and 13.
She was still saying that that is just

1325
00:59:05,761 --> 00:59:06,780
retarded.
Isn't it?

1326
00:59:06,781 --> 00:59:10,590
Convenient how her views on everything
just happened to evolve at exactly the

1327
00:59:10,591 --> 00:59:14,040
same point so that when they win,
51 percent of the American population

1328
00:59:14,041 --> 00:59:15,990
comes around to them.
She has an awakening.

1329
00:59:15,991 --> 00:59:19,800
It's just so mysterious that I had.
I just don't understand,

1330
00:59:19,801 --> 00:59:24,801
and this is a key clue me in this who is
trying to keep gay marriage illegal in

1331
00:59:25,731 --> 00:59:27,830
Australia because if there's all those
people,

1332
00:59:28,010 --> 00:59:30,350
you would think that if the majority of
the people wanted it,

1333
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:33,440
if the prime minister wanted,
have all these people wanted it,

1334
00:59:33,441 --> 00:59:34,490
why?
Who is,

1335
00:59:34,850 --> 00:59:37,610
who's working in,
what benefit is there of keeping it

1336
00:59:37,611 --> 00:59:38,080
illegal?

1337
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:40,440
So think about,
I think everyone knows it's going to

1338
00:59:40,450 --> 00:59:41,950
happen.
It's just a matter of trying to postpone

1339
00:59:41,951 --> 00:59:43,870
it,
but it's what's basically happened is

1340
00:59:43,871 --> 00:59:47,470
that there is a rift between within the
Conservative Party between conservative

1341
00:59:47,471 --> 00:59:51,130
conservatives and progressive and like
socially liberal conservatives.

1342
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:53,710
I think about the Republican Party here
where you've got like Christian

1343
00:59:53,711 --> 00:59:58,711
evangelicals as a component of it,
but you've also got the rand poll slash

1344
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:01,390
maybe Donald Trump kind of contingent
people who aren't,

1345
01:00:01,420 --> 01:00:03,640
who don't want it,
don't really care what people do in the

1346
01:00:03,641 --> 01:00:06,610
privacy of their own homes,
but they're fiscally conservative.

1347
01:00:07,030 --> 01:00:08,470
Uh,
those people.

1348
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:13,560
That faction had previously nominated a
leader to be the prime minister and that

1349
01:00:14,051 --> 01:00:16,840
was the prime minister.
He got stabbed in the back by one of his

1350
01:00:16,841 --> 01:00:20,470
colleagues who's socially liberal and
the only way that he could get the

1351
01:00:20,471 --> 01:00:24,820
support of the faction that he needed to
become prime minister was by

1352
01:00:24,821 --> 01:00:27,250
guaranteeing them that he wouldn't move
too fast on gay marriage.

1353
01:00:28,700 --> 01:00:32,140
So it's a minority of a minority,
of concern of like culturally

1354
01:00:32,141 --> 01:00:35,890
conservative conservatives who represent
rural districts with a bunch of farmers

1355
01:00:35,891 --> 01:00:36,320
in them.

1356
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:37,790
Uh,
the farmers,

1357
01:00:37,990 --> 01:00:39,710
you know,
it's always the God damn farmers.

1358
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:42,110
I had a joke,
one of my old specials,

1359
01:00:42,380 --> 01:00:44,510
there's only two types of people that
care about gay marriage.

1360
01:00:45,590 --> 01:00:48,590
People were really dumb,
or people that are secretly worried that

1361
01:00:48,591 --> 01:00:53,591
dicks are delicious.
Think that makes sense.

1362
01:00:57,201 --> 01:00:58,700
That's right.
Fucking farmers.

1363
01:00:58,760 --> 01:01:00,230
Someone's got to get them to suck a
dick.

1364
01:01:00,231 --> 01:01:03,740
And he exactly could realize what's the,
all the Hoopla about what about

1365
01:01:05,390 --> 01:01:08,090
just go ahead and suck it.
You probably wouldn't even like it.

1366
01:01:08,670 --> 01:01:09,890
And then you'd be like,
yeah,

1367
01:01:09,910 --> 01:01:11,600
this guy,
I don't give a fuck.

1368
01:01:11,630 --> 01:01:14,190
What about the guy who was sucking all
those whole sticks and um,

1369
01:01:14,370 --> 01:01:18,980
and a claw is that Seattle was,
he was dressed up

1370
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,700
and like leather and he'd go out in the
farm in the middle of the night and he'd

1371
01:01:21,701 --> 01:01:22,460
like give.

1372
01:01:22,460 --> 01:01:25,130
Oh,
you're talking about the guy who got

1373
01:01:25,131 --> 01:01:27,530
arrested several times talking about the
guy who died.

1374
01:01:28,010 --> 01:01:31,390
He died from getting fired,
but his name was.

1375
01:01:31,430 --> 01:01:34,550
They used to call him Mr Hands.
I love that you know his name.

1376
01:01:34,551 --> 01:01:38,840
Yeah.
There was a documentary called zoo and

1377
01:01:39,130 --> 01:01:43,490
it was all about zoophilia,
which is a real sexual attraction that

1378
01:01:43,491 --> 01:01:46,790
people have to farm animals.
Always white people by the way.

1379
01:01:47,060 --> 01:01:48,200
Hollow white people.
Yeah.

1380
01:01:48,220 --> 01:01:49,640
Actually,
I think the guy who got arrested was

1381
01:01:49,641 --> 01:01:52,410
black,
I think just covered in leather,

1382
01:01:54,140 --> 01:01:57,110
black leather bro.
He's from Australia.

1383
01:01:58,940 --> 01:02:01,370
It's also kind of adding insult to
injury for the animal that you're

1384
01:02:01,371 --> 01:02:02,300
actually wearing.
Leather.

1385
01:02:02,301 --> 01:02:03,380
You,
I'm wearing your hat.

1386
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:05,390
I'm wearing your skin at the same time
as I.

1387
01:02:05,390 --> 01:02:07,000
Fuck you.
He's not wearing a horse here.

1388
01:02:07,190 --> 01:02:07,941
Maybe not.
Yeah,

1389
01:02:07,941 --> 01:02:09,290
it's different.
It's different species,

1390
01:02:09,650 --> 01:02:14,650
but I'm this guy who lived in Itam claw.
They had found each other online on a

1391
01:02:16,110 --> 01:02:17,870
him in divorce,
him and all these people,

1392
01:02:18,170 --> 01:02:20,040
they develop this relationship

1393
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:25,050
online with these people that were
really into horses and getting fucked by

1394
01:02:25,140 --> 01:02:30,140
farm animals and so they invested in
this property and they got this farm and

1395
01:02:30,901 --> 01:02:33,150
they had these horses.
There was over a hundred hours of

1396
01:02:33,151 --> 01:02:37,260
footage of these people getting fucked
by animals and one guy,

1397
01:02:37,340 --> 01:02:38,700
they type it.
Oh,

1398
01:02:38,710 --> 01:02:40,020
there's a video of it.
You can watch it.

1399
01:02:40,021 --> 01:02:40,530
You want to see.

1400
01:02:40,530 --> 01:02:44,900
Absolutely.
What else am I doing this afternoon and

1401
01:02:46,170 --> 01:02:51,170
folks who are listening only I urge you
to go to youtube just to watch the

1402
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:55,230
subtle twist of his head.
Absolutely.

1403
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:58,320
I'm going to wake in Los Angeles.
I got a lot of time on my hands between

1404
01:02:58,321 --> 01:02:59,154
meetings.
There'll be.

1405
01:02:59,460 --> 01:03:01,620
Do you want to win the lottery?
Absolutely.

1406
01:03:02,330 --> 01:03:05,670
Abandoned and famous enough.
Claw horse sex faces,

1407
01:03:05,700 --> 01:03:08,010
new charges in Tennessee.
Um,

1408
01:03:08,170 --> 01:03:10,500
was a different guy.
What year is this?

1409
01:03:10,501 --> 01:03:12,100
Two thousand nine.
It's after I'm.

1410
01:03:12,120 --> 01:03:13,830
That guy was dead.
It says.

1411
01:03:13,831 --> 01:03:14,490
Okay.
Here it is.

1412
01:03:14,490 --> 01:03:18,300
A former Washington state man who was
convicted of trespassing at an Itam

1413
01:03:18,301 --> 01:03:22,590
cloth farm where a man was fatally
injured while having sex with a horse in

1414
01:03:22,591 --> 01:03:23,790
2005.
Right.

1415
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:27,270
Is accused of having sex with animals on
a Tennessee farm.

1416
01:03:27,271 --> 01:03:29,190
So one of the same people that was in
that group,

1417
01:03:29,570 --> 01:03:31,940
the guy.
What did they grow out of it?

1418
01:03:31,941 --> 01:03:32,510
Of course.
I mean,

1419
01:03:32,510 --> 01:03:34,310
the way you're hardwired is the way
you're hardwired.

1420
01:03:34,311 --> 01:03:35,870
It's like,
I don't know about all that.

1421
01:03:35,871 --> 01:03:38,240
I would think the ones that my friend
got fucked to death.

1422
01:03:38,300 --> 01:03:39,980
I might want to reconsider it.
So yeah,

1423
01:03:40,070 --> 01:03:41,440
you would think that sensible,
but it's.

1424
01:03:41,530 --> 01:03:43,010
I mean the thing is like being gay or
something.

1425
01:03:43,011 --> 01:03:45,770
I always get in trouble because when we
talk about pedophilia and stuff like

1426
01:03:45,771 --> 01:03:47,240
that,
I sort of make the same analogy,

1427
01:03:47,241 --> 01:03:51,230
which is I have.
I mean whilst it's the worst conceivable

1428
01:03:51,231 --> 01:03:53,360
thing that I can imagine anyone doing
morally,

1429
01:03:53,540 --> 01:03:57,140
I have some sympathy for people who are
hard wired in such a way that they get a

1430
01:03:57,141 --> 01:03:59,630
hard on from infants or animals or
something.

1431
01:03:59,631 --> 01:04:00,350
Right?
I mean,

1432
01:04:00,350 --> 01:04:03,230
the reason I'm not a pedophile is not
because I'm morally superior is because

1433
01:04:03,231 --> 01:04:06,470
I've never been attracted to a,
to anyone who's not post pubescent,

1434
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:09,680
most likely you're right.
Most likely you're right.

1435
01:04:10,520 --> 01:04:15,520
The real problem becomes in trying to
decipher what is causing some person to

1436
01:04:17,121 --> 01:04:20,840
have these feelings.
Like is it an instance of them being

1437
01:04:20,841 --> 01:04:22,440
molested themselves and they were
younger.

1438
01:04:22,441 --> 01:04:22,510
Yeah.

1439
01:04:22,510 --> 01:04:24,610
Which is Mary.
It's disproportionately.

1440
01:04:24,660 --> 01:04:28,630
Yeah.
Is it just an error in the way the brain

1441
01:04:28,631 --> 01:04:30,690
works was that

1442
01:04:31,120 --> 01:04:32,290
some people have epilepsy.
Yeah,

1443
01:04:32,291 --> 01:04:34,750
but this is very different.
This is like clear victimization.

1444
01:04:34,780 --> 01:04:38,650
Gayness is to people choosing to be
attracted to the same sex or being

1445
01:04:38,651 --> 01:04:40,720
attracted the same sex and choosing to
be with each other rather.

1446
01:04:40,770 --> 01:04:42,030
Yeah.
This is different.

1447
01:04:42,680 --> 01:04:44,040
I'm just talking about what,
what,

1448
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:45,450
uh,
what you're attracted to.

1449
01:04:45,451 --> 01:04:47,070
Right.
If you separate the actual act,

1450
01:04:47,490 --> 01:04:48,840
obviously,
obviously it's very,

1451
01:04:48,841 --> 01:04:51,620
very different because you're abusing
someone who ha,

1452
01:04:51,660 --> 01:04:53,490
who doesn't,
who isn't old enough to be able to

1453
01:04:53,491 --> 01:04:54,790
consent.
Uh,

1454
01:04:54,810 --> 01:04:59,810
but the act of feeling like you're
attracted a radically to a baby,

1455
01:05:01,740 --> 01:05:03,540
right?
Regardless of whether you act on it,

1456
01:05:03,690 --> 01:05:07,380
that is something that's subjectively
must just be a horrible prison.

1457
01:05:07,381 --> 01:05:08,700
I mean,
imagine if you could never get your

1458
01:05:08,701 --> 01:05:13,701
rocks off without torturing and other
person wouldn't be a pretty place to be.

1459
01:05:14,460 --> 01:05:16,620
It would be horrific.
Just wonder,

1460
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:17,721
you know,
I,

1461
01:05:17,721 --> 01:05:18,040
I would

1462
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:22,000
like to agree with you,
but when I think about it,

1463
01:05:22,001 --> 01:05:26,120
I wonder what is the actual process that
leads someone who's.

1464
01:05:26,490 --> 01:05:28,420
I mean,
what is going on in their mind?

1465
01:05:28,421 --> 01:05:30,580
I can't grasp it.
I can't understand it,

1466
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:33,180
so may I just got to be multifactorial,
right?

1467
01:05:33,290 --> 01:05:35,950
It's got a bunch of shit.
It's probably childhood abuse.

1468
01:05:35,951 --> 01:05:37,750
It's probably a combination of who
knows,

1469
01:05:37,751 --> 01:05:40,480
but that doesn't change the fact that
they're presumably not capable of,

1470
01:05:40,690 --> 01:05:41,980
of,
of changing it.

1471
01:05:42,190 --> 01:05:45,040
I don't know if that's the case,
but it seems to be true.

1472
01:05:45,070 --> 01:05:48,430
The recidivism rate amongst people who
molest children is insanely high.

1473
01:05:48,460 --> 01:05:50,620
Absolutely.
Give them the option of chemical

1474
01:05:50,621 --> 01:05:54,820
castration as much additive to jail and
then just have them with low libido

1475
01:05:54,821 --> 01:05:58,210
goes.
The problem becomes whether or not it's

1476
01:05:58,211 --> 01:06:03,040
actually sexual or whether it's
psychological and if it's uniform,

1477
01:06:03,250 --> 01:06:06,850
like some people might be sexually
attracted to children in some way that

1478
01:06:06,851 --> 01:06:10,090
you could cure with chemical castration,
whereas some of them might be

1479
01:06:10,091 --> 01:06:14,710
psychologically attracted to the
dominance and to like what they say

1480
01:06:14,711 --> 01:06:15,490
about rape,
right?

1481
01:06:15,490 --> 01:06:18,220
That rape isn't really about sex and a
lot of the cases,

1482
01:06:18,700 --> 01:06:22,300
obviously in some cases it's about sex,
but in some cases it's not.

1483
01:06:22,330 --> 01:06:25,060
It's about power and dominance and how
many people.

1484
01:06:25,061 --> 01:06:27,670
It's not a sexual thing.
What if they wound up because they

1485
01:06:27,671 --> 01:06:32,110
couldn't get it up.
They wound up just doing things to kids

1486
01:06:32,290 --> 01:06:35,200
in a fucked up way because they wanted
to control them and dominate them.

1487
01:06:35,360 --> 01:06:39,520
Well then they're just being dicks,
but I mean it might be the origin of it

1488
01:06:39,521 --> 01:06:40,354
all.
I mean there,

1489
01:06:40,370 --> 01:06:44,050
there might be a bunch of different
versions of this and that's for them.

1490
01:06:44,051 --> 01:06:46,660
That might be the origin of it at all.
They might be just they want to torture

1491
01:06:46,661 --> 01:06:47,494
people.
Yep.

1492
01:06:47,620 --> 01:06:49,770
I mean there's associate pass out there,
the psychopaths.

1493
01:06:49,900 --> 01:06:52,870
There's people that are just fucked.
Their brain is fucked.

1494
01:06:53,140 --> 01:06:55,150
When you hear about a serial killer,
I mean,

1495
01:06:55,210 --> 01:06:58,330
is there a chemical castration for a
serial killer to stop them from enjoying

1496
01:06:58,331 --> 01:06:59,010
killing people?

1497
01:06:59,010 --> 01:07:01,330
No,
but I've spoken to experts about

1498
01:07:01,331 --> 01:07:04,060
pedophilia who say like,
what you want to do,

1499
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:08,800
we're making a mistake at the moment by
demonizing the condition rather than

1500
01:07:08,801 --> 01:07:10,460
demonizing the act.
Right,

1501
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:14,140
so what do you want to do is set up a
scenario in which it's possible for a 15

1502
01:07:14,141 --> 01:07:19,090
year old kid who realizes that he's
attracted to infants to go to a

1503
01:07:19,091 --> 01:07:24,091
psychiatrist and get help and talk about
his options without feeling like he is a

1504
01:07:25,121 --> 01:07:27,370
total monster just because he's having
those feelings.

1505
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:30,490
It's hard for us to think that way
because if he acted on those feelings,

1506
01:07:30,491 --> 01:07:33,370
he would be a monster,
but you want to find.

1507
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:37,060
You want him to be able to avail himself
of whatever kind of medical treatment is

1508
01:07:37,990 --> 01:07:41,850
available rather than just going out and
hiding in the shadows and doing and

1509
01:07:41,860 --> 01:07:44,740
committing monstrous acts.
I don't know how to get around that.

1510
01:07:44,770 --> 01:07:46,240
I don't need.
I don't think anybody does.

1511
01:07:46,241 --> 01:07:46,930
I mean think,
think,

1512
01:07:46,930 --> 01:07:48,880
think.
It's one of the reasons why this is such

1513
01:07:48,881 --> 01:07:52,390
a compelling subject is because it's one
of the most horrific things,

1514
01:07:52,690 --> 01:07:57,690
like there's some horrific,
like undeniably horrific things that

1515
01:07:58,511 --> 01:08:00,110
people are capable of doing.
Murders,

1516
01:08:00,111 --> 01:08:01,360
one of them,
red is one of them.

1517
01:08:01,510 --> 01:08:02,350
Torture,
torture.

1518
01:08:02,680 --> 01:08:04,940
This is right up there.
It's right up there with torture with

1519
01:08:04,941 --> 01:08:08,170
Isis beheadings and shit.
There was a guy on a talk show once that

1520
01:08:08,171 --> 01:08:12,520
was talking about his.
He's compelled to have sex with children

1521
01:08:12,521 --> 01:08:14,620
and he's been sexually attracted to
children all of his life,

1522
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:16,130
but he fights it off and he doesn't

1523
01:08:16,130 --> 01:08:18,230
do anything about it.
He wanted people to understand it and he

1524
01:08:18,231 --> 01:08:19,970
was talking about it openly and I was
like,

1525
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,910
first of all,
how brave is this guy that he's willing

1526
01:08:22,911 --> 01:08:26,720
to go on television and do these
interviews and talk about his compulsion

1527
01:08:26,721 --> 01:08:30,320
even though he says he's innocent of the
actual act itself.

1528
01:08:30,350 --> 01:08:35,350
He has this compulsion and I think the
spectrum of a different ways that the

1529
01:08:36,831 --> 01:08:41,831
mind functions is so complex and so
confusing as to what's the origin of

1530
01:08:42,021 --> 01:08:46,070
these behavior patterns.
Is it because of abuse is because of a

1531
01:08:46,071 --> 01:08:47,420
malfunction?
Is it a,

1532
01:08:47,430 --> 01:08:51,710
is there a tumor like what the fuck is
going on in someone's brain that leads

1533
01:08:51,711 --> 01:08:55,040
them down these paths and I don't think
that's been answered.

1534
01:08:55,490 --> 01:08:56,260
No,

1535
01:08:56,260 --> 01:08:58,430
I mean what?
Look at the take it back to be best

1536
01:08:58,431 --> 01:09:00,920
reality and like having a,
giving a horse a blow job.

1537
01:09:01,240 --> 01:09:05,840
Like is there anything necessarily
unethical about giving a host of blow

1538
01:09:05,841 --> 01:09:07,820
job?
Is the horses pushing back?

1539
01:09:07,821 --> 01:09:09,500
I say no.
What if?

1540
01:09:10,070 --> 01:09:10,970
Yeah,
exactly.

1541
01:09:11,030 --> 01:09:13,860
So yeah,
if you offer up your butt to a horse and

1542
01:09:13,870 --> 01:09:15,560
he's.
And he's just digging in there.

1543
01:09:19,540 --> 01:09:21,560
I'm telling you though,
like what is morally,

1544
01:09:21,561 --> 01:09:23,720
what is actually morally wrong with
fucking a horse?

1545
01:09:23,721 --> 01:09:26,120
If the horse is into it,
well the horse fucks you.

1546
01:09:26,121 --> 01:09:31,121
First of all the horses atop
the video of the guy getting fucked to

1547
01:09:32,691 --> 01:09:36,730
death by the horse though is horrific.
Of course available.

1548
01:09:36,820 --> 01:09:40,130
How is he not able to get out of the
situation with the horse out and pin?

1549
01:09:40,410 --> 01:09:42,770
Those are the video starts out with a
buddy of mine sent this to me.

1550
01:09:44,450 --> 01:09:47,630
I watched it 100 times to my computer
right now,

1551
01:09:47,830 --> 01:09:49,580
the screensaver.
It's in there.

1552
01:09:50,020 --> 01:09:52,790
I just copy and I put it on.
Little flash drives leaving around my

1553
01:09:52,791 --> 01:09:55,580
house just in case somebody decided to
delete it off the Internet.

1554
01:09:55,850 --> 01:09:59,240
I'm the guy.
It's the video starts out and the guy is

1555
01:09:59,241 --> 01:10:03,020
naked and he's bent over bale of Hay and
then his friend,

1556
01:10:03,230 --> 01:10:07,040
I use air quotes,
grabs a horse his penis and leaves it up

1557
01:10:07,041 --> 01:10:07,970
to his butt.
And you're like,

1558
01:10:07,971 --> 01:10:12,500
there is no fucking way.
And then what does that even happen?

1559
01:10:12,501 --> 01:10:14,570
How?
Like what kind of what?

1560
01:10:14,571 --> 01:10:17,330
No,
he's up in his laptop.

1561
01:10:17,331 --> 01:10:19,520
Ladies and gentlemen.
Here we go.

1562
01:10:19,580 --> 01:10:21,500
Don't be scared.
Homey.com.

1563
01:10:21,770 --> 01:10:22,551
What do you mean how,
I mean,

1564
01:10:22,551 --> 01:10:24,530
the guy's just got a giant,
but it's really that simple.

1565
01:10:25,180 --> 01:10:27,440
I know that like,
you gotta like you gotTa Lube up a

1566
01:10:27,441 --> 01:10:29,420
little bit beforehand,
you're going to make sure that you're

1567
01:10:29,421 --> 01:10:31,390
available,
but

1568
01:10:32,920 --> 01:10:33,753
that's a lot.

1569
01:10:33,830 --> 01:10:35,960
That's a lot of fingers.
You got to put it in before the horse

1570
01:10:35,961 --> 01:10:36,621
can go.
Yeah,

1571
01:10:36,621 --> 01:10:38,840
there's a lot going on there.
It's not that simple.

1572
01:10:39,090 --> 01:10:40,520
Um,
it's just,

1573
01:10:40,550 --> 01:10:42,170
it's again,
it's one of those things like,

1574
01:10:42,171 --> 01:10:47,171
what the fuck is it about a person's
mind that allows that in there?

1575
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:50,810
Yeah.
What and how do you get from A.

1576
01:10:50,810 --> 01:10:55,010
I think this would be an amazing thing
to try to actually being there in the

1577
01:10:55,011 --> 01:10:57,500
bond,
like straddled over the bale of Hay.

1578
01:10:57,501 --> 01:10:59,120
I don't know how you.
I'd be too.

1579
01:10:59,540 --> 01:11:01,370
I'd be too bashful.
Even if I wanted to do it,

1580
01:11:01,410 --> 01:11:02,780
I'll be too.
It's adorable.

1581
01:11:03,200 --> 01:11:06,590
I wouldn't have the guts
I think.

1582
01:11:07,220 --> 01:11:10,490
I mean I'm obviously,
I'm just thinking what the fuck do I

1583
01:11:10,491 --> 01:11:11,380
know?
But,

1584
01:11:11,460 --> 01:11:12,890
but I'm pretending to have a horse
walker.

1585
01:11:13,110 --> 01:11:15,060
I think there's,
there's just.

1586
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:17,430
Look,
there's a reason why some people love

1587
01:11:17,431 --> 01:11:22,431
jazz music and there's some people that
love basketball and some people like

1588
01:11:22,651 --> 01:11:25,500
sailing,
some people hate the water and some

1589
01:11:25,501 --> 01:11:28,710
people want to sunbathe all day and some
people want to only go out at night and

1590
01:11:28,711 --> 01:11:33,711
we're plucking people vary a lot.
And in this gigantic broad variance of

1591
01:11:34,861 --> 01:11:39,861
human beings every now and then put one
pressure cooker spits out a doodle x get

1592
01:11:40,321 --> 01:11:41,154
fucked by a horse.

1593
01:11:41,540 --> 01:11:42,650
Yeah,
I totally take that,

1594
01:11:42,651 --> 01:11:46,050
but what I mean is I'm amazed at the,
at the people who can,

1595
01:11:46,100 --> 01:11:50,660
who can translate their latent mental
desires into actual real world

1596
01:11:50,661 --> 01:11:52,670
experiences,
whether that's climbing Mount Everest.

1597
01:11:52,820 --> 01:11:54,260
I mean there's all kinds of things I'd
like to do.

1598
01:11:54,910 --> 01:11:57,890
Joe's eyes just getting real life as he
looks at something on his laptop.

1599
01:11:57,940 --> 01:12:00,770
I'm trying try to find Mr. I found it,
Mr. like whether it's a,

1600
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:03,470
I'd like to go scuba diving with sharks.
I'd like to go,

1601
01:12:03,471 --> 01:12:03,981
uh,
you know,

1602
01:12:03,981 --> 01:12:06,200
I'd like to go scuba diving under
Antarctic ice,

1603
01:12:06,201 --> 01:12:09,770
but I haven't done it because I'm too
much of a pussy and I'm too much of a

1604
01:12:09,771 --> 01:12:11,960
pussy to get raped by a horse.
That's what I'm saying,

1605
01:12:11,961 --> 01:12:14,240
dude.
It's not my thing.

1606
01:12:14,810 --> 01:12:17,900
I don't get it.
Why is it in the meantime I'm going to

1607
01:12:17,901 --> 01:12:20,060
plug my podcast,
which is which people should go and

1608
01:12:20,061 --> 01:12:21,500
check out way the people alive.

1609
01:12:21,740 --> 01:12:23,000
We have paypal as well.
One word,

1610
01:12:23,360 --> 01:12:24,890
uh,
and you can find it on the.

1611
01:12:25,190 --> 01:12:28,760
We basically get three interesting
people in a bar and we all talk about

1612
01:12:29,500 --> 01:12:31,280
about what's going on in the world.
Jim Norton,

1613
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:32,760
Artie Lange,
beautiful.

1614
01:12:32,790 --> 01:12:33,920
Looks like that.
Great.

1615
01:12:33,980 --> 01:12:36,650
Well New York's a good spot to do that.
A lot of opinionated people.

1616
01:12:36,651 --> 01:12:37,580
Yeah,
it's fantastic.

1617
01:12:37,850 --> 01:12:40,100
We did one here as well with Greg
Fitzsimmons and uh,

1618
01:12:40,370 --> 01:12:43,160
Fred's dollar and Zach Craig are funny
people and uh,

1619
01:12:43,210 --> 01:12:46,490
Joe was on it as well.
If you want to check out episode 30,

1620
01:12:46,520 --> 01:12:49,480
episode 30 Joe Rogan bars that,
uh,

1621
01:12:49,490 --> 01:12:51,710
that particular one is pine box rock
shop,

1622
01:12:52,160 --> 01:12:53,140
which is where we used to do it.

1623
01:12:53,190 --> 01:12:55,450
That was in,
it was great.

1624
01:12:55,530 --> 01:12:58,200
That place looks awesome.
And now we do it in Williamsburg.

1625
01:12:58,440 --> 01:12:59,370
Oh,
of course you do.

1626
01:12:59,400 --> 01:13:03,330
How dare Bushwick.
Do you have to roll up the,

1627
01:13:03,500 --> 01:13:04,470
the cops of your pants?

1628
01:13:04,490 --> 01:13:05,500
No,
it wouldn't be a tide.

1629
01:13:05,501 --> 01:13:09,520
It'd be like a bow tie,
like done Sinatra Style and talked or.

1630
01:13:09,540 --> 01:13:11,960
Exactly around my neck.
And he found the video.

1631
01:13:11,961 --> 01:13:13,610
I want to say some fucking.
Here it is.

1632
01:13:14,420 --> 01:13:15,620
I don't.
Do I want to say this?

1633
01:13:15,980 --> 01:13:18,200
Able to undo this.
Am I going to able to unsee this?

1634
01:13:18,201 --> 01:13:20,990
Will make sure that he doesn't.
It doesn't get shown on screen.

1635
01:13:21,050 --> 01:13:22,880
Jamie,
starring Mr Han's.

1636
01:13:22,940 --> 01:13:25,570
So here's the gentlemen.
There's a little dark,

1637
01:13:26,720 --> 01:13:30,260
it looks like a night vision type thing
because the guys lifting the horse's

1638
01:13:31,430 --> 01:13:33,380
front,
legs are on his shoulders or another

1639
01:13:33,390 --> 01:13:36,160
horse.
His front legs are on the Hay and the

1640
01:13:36,210 --> 01:13:40,340
Horse is dick and it's a Holla.
Look at this.

1641
01:13:40,390 --> 01:13:42,470
No,
I don't want to be seeing this.

1642
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:47,060
Dare he cued up and the guy's having a
hard time getting it in at first.

1643
01:13:47,061 --> 01:13:47,894
Right?
And then

1644
01:13:49,100 --> 01:13:50,270
it goes all the way.
And is that one?

1645
01:13:50,310 --> 01:13:52,820
It was just on the son.
Yeah,

1646
01:13:52,821 --> 01:13:54,750
he died.
Sounds.

1647
01:13:55,650 --> 01:13:57,440
Do you hear the sound?
Yes.

1648
01:13:57,500 --> 01:14:00,410
And now the Dick comes out and it's got
liquid all over like,

1649
01:14:01,330 --> 01:14:02,001
oh,
is that what it was?

1650
01:14:02,001 --> 01:14:03,890
Yeah.
Can't look anymore.

1651
01:14:06,390 --> 01:14:07,700
Wonder if I can go to jail for having
that.

1652
01:14:11,260 --> 01:14:14,170
Like it's totally illegal.
I'm like,

1653
01:14:14,171 --> 01:14:16,150
I'm feeling I'm feeling a little
violated.

1654
01:14:16,151 --> 01:14:18,520
Right?
Should a guy died that way.

1655
01:14:18,550 --> 01:14:22,630
I just saw him in dying from a Dick
Eighty minutes ago.

1656
01:14:22,631 --> 01:14:27,631
I pulled into the car park here on a
beautiful California day and if you'd

1657
01:14:27,641 --> 01:14:32,641
told me then that in 80 minutes time I
would have just watched a man die from

1658
01:14:33,221 --> 01:14:35,350
being anal.
He raped by a horse.

1659
01:14:35,860 --> 01:14:37,930
How about the sound he makes?
I wouldn't have believed you when you

1660
01:14:37,931 --> 01:14:38,790
hear the sound again.
No,

1661
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:40,270
I don't want to hear the sound again.
Joe.

1662
01:14:40,290 --> 01:14:42,520
This is a sound pleasant conversation is
pleasant.

1663
01:14:42,550 --> 01:14:45,100
What about doesn't happen to us.
We should be happy.

1664
01:14:45,680 --> 01:14:47,380
Be Happy.
We figured out a way to not have this

1665
01:14:47,381 --> 01:14:48,570
happen to us.
Yeah.

1666
01:14:48,720 --> 01:14:50,320
Yeah.
It's pretty easy to not have that happen

1667
01:14:50,321 --> 01:14:50,721
to you.
There are.

1668
01:14:50,721 --> 01:14:53,440
There are so many things that have to
happen in order for that to happen.

1669
01:14:54,050 --> 01:14:54,883
Okay.

1670
01:15:01,020 --> 01:15:05,490
I hear that.
That's the moment in which is which

1671
01:15:05,750 --> 01:15:08,280
horses.
Penis goes through his intestine and

1672
01:15:08,281 --> 01:15:09,840
into his head.
That's called.

1673
01:15:09,870 --> 01:15:13,830
That's a wrap.
That's a wrap for this life.

1674
01:15:13,831 --> 01:15:15,110
Folks.
Take care of.

1675
01:15:15,150 --> 01:15:18,300
See the next dimension.
Gilis fucking way to die.

1676
01:15:19,080 --> 01:15:21,870
The Darwin awards.
There's one who maybe lost.

1677
01:15:22,170 --> 01:15:23,940
Awesome.
Maybe it's better than being in a

1678
01:15:23,941 --> 01:15:25,590
nursing home and having some guy kick
you.

1679
01:15:27,660 --> 01:15:29,910
Isn't there anything in between that
allows my only two options?

1680
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:31,660
Either they get to be in a nursing home
and said,

1681
01:15:31,661 --> 01:15:34,110
somebody kicked me.
I get to get mainly raped to death by a

1682
01:15:34,111 --> 01:15:35,010
horse.
That's it,

1683
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:36,880
we're options,
but I mean,

1684
01:15:37,080 --> 01:15:39,900
listen,
my point of view is that this guy in

1685
01:15:39,901 --> 01:15:44,100
getting fucked to death by a horse
created this video and this video has

1686
01:15:44,101 --> 01:15:48,240
provided me with hundreds of hours of
entertainment that I would have never

1687
01:15:48,241 --> 01:15:50,700
gotten without this guide of videos.

1688
01:15:50,780 --> 01:15:53,510
Only one minute long.
If you have 100 times.

1689
01:15:53,940 --> 01:15:56,010
I've watched it so many times,
I'm exaggerating,

1690
01:15:56,630 --> 01:16:01,020
but think about all the people
throughout the world who will now Google

1691
01:16:01,020 --> 01:16:03,000
Mr Han's find that video.
I'm sure it's up there somewhere.

1692
01:16:03,030 --> 01:16:06,420
[inaudible] laugh their fucking ass off.
Like that guy probably gave all those

1693
01:16:06,421 --> 01:16:09,390
people a burst of happiness like through
his death.

1694
01:16:09,650 --> 01:16:13,800
Like do you think about like what you've
done in life and what having those

1695
01:16:13,801 --> 01:16:16,410
experiences and showing them to other
people,

1696
01:16:16,470 --> 01:16:19,110
what impact it has on them.
How many people have watched people like

1697
01:16:19,111 --> 01:16:21,300
do those,
those bird suits,

1698
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:24,330
the squirrel suits where they jump off
buildings and shit and they fly around

1699
01:16:24,660 --> 01:16:26,400
and you watch me get a thrill out of it.
Like,

1700
01:16:26,401 --> 01:16:27,840
whoa.
You watch those videos.

1701
01:16:27,841 --> 01:16:28,860
You get a thrill out of that,
right?

1702
01:16:28,990 --> 01:16:29,823
Yeah.
Gotcha guy.

1703
01:16:29,850 --> 01:16:31,710
Bungee jumping and get a thrill.
Yeah.

1704
01:16:31,740 --> 01:16:34,140
Watch this and millions of people.

1705
01:16:34,340 --> 01:16:35,173
Sure.
I think.

1706
01:16:35,210 --> 01:16:36,930
I think it.
Does that make you happy?

1707
01:16:36,940 --> 01:16:39,090
The same way that the birdman videos
make you happy?

1708
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:42,600
Yes.
There's a difference here at dude dies

1709
01:16:42,601 --> 01:16:44,250
getting anal.
He raped by a horse.

1710
01:16:44,570 --> 01:16:46,070
Bird guys die all the time.
Yeah.

1711
01:16:46,071 --> 01:16:49,950
I wouldn't want to save trees and shit.
These motherfuckers.

1712
01:16:50,490 --> 01:16:53,060
See that's what I'm talking about.
This is a humble bored on the road,

1713
01:16:53,110 --> 01:16:58,110
on the edge of the top of a skyscraper.
These guys are spinning around one of

1714
01:16:58,351 --> 01:16:58,951
these.
First of all,

1715
01:16:58,951 --> 01:17:01,890
you're counting on these Chinese lithium
ion batteries.

1716
01:17:01,891 --> 01:17:04,770
They were put together by slaves.
Who knows if they're going to burst into

1717
01:17:04,771 --> 01:17:06,450
flames.
This guy's doing handstands.

1718
01:17:06,720 --> 01:17:09,290
He's doing fucking handstands on top of
a skyscraper.

1719
01:17:09,950 --> 01:17:10,100
What

1720
01:17:10,100 --> 01:17:11,150
does that Dubai's?
Yes.

1721
01:17:11,210 --> 01:17:14,030
Where is he?
It looks like I can't watch this.

1722
01:17:14,180 --> 01:17:15,710
No,
he's perfect example.

1723
01:17:15,770 --> 01:17:18,560
If you saw that like that gives you a
thrill,

1724
01:17:18,860 --> 01:17:21,820
but if one of those guys did that and
then when flying off the building like

1725
01:17:21,830 --> 01:17:23,690
what did.
I wouldn't like what if Mr. Hands.

1726
01:17:23,691 --> 01:17:26,210
That was a video where he lived because
he got fucked to death.

1727
01:17:26,211 --> 01:17:26,841
A gang.
I mean,

1728
01:17:26,841 --> 01:17:28,790
you got fucked a gang at times where you
get fucked to death.

1729
01:17:28,920 --> 01:17:30,250
I'd be,
I'd be happier.

1730
01:17:30,580 --> 01:17:33,180
I'd be happier if he lived,
but then I wouldn't know.

1731
01:17:33,230 --> 01:17:38,230
I also wouldn't be happy about that.
I'm just enjoying the entire Mr Han's

1732
01:17:38,621 --> 01:17:39,670
experienced Joe Rogan.

1733
01:17:39,740 --> 01:17:41,450
What if you met him and then he was
annoying you?

1734
01:17:41,490 --> 01:17:43,550
I wish that guy got fucked to death.
He probably would be.

1735
01:17:44,480 --> 01:17:45,313
Did you hear,

1736
01:17:45,900 --> 01:17:48,300
did you hear that Oklahoma has had to
change there.

1737
01:17:48,301 --> 01:17:50,430
I was just looking this up.
But when we were talking about

1738
01:17:50,520 --> 01:17:55,520
pedophilia that uh,
there was a rape case in.

1739
01:17:55,610 --> 01:17:58,020
This is not something to laugh about,
but it is interesting about how we

1740
01:17:58,021 --> 01:18:01,890
define rape were a 17 year old kid.
This was last month.

1741
01:18:02,100 --> 01:18:04,410
Uh,
and a 16 year old.

1742
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:07,560
He made her.
Well,

1743
01:18:07,650 --> 01:18:09,750
here's what happened.
She was really drunk.

1744
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:11,550
They'd been drinking in the park with
some friends.

1745
01:18:11,670 --> 01:18:14,250
He gave her a ride home.
She woke up,

1746
01:18:14,610 --> 01:18:17,340
I think in the middle of the night,
completely deliriously drunk,

1747
01:18:17,341 --> 01:18:19,530
and her mother or grandmother took her
to the hospital because she was so

1748
01:18:19,531 --> 01:18:22,550
drunk.
She woke up in hospital.

1749
01:18:22,570 --> 01:18:26,610
First thing she kind of really
remembered was the doctor's asking her

1750
01:18:26,611 --> 01:18:31,410
what kind of sexual activity she had
happened because they'd found a some of

1751
01:18:31,470 --> 01:18:35,130
the 17 year old's DNA around her mouth
and on her legs.

1752
01:18:35,550 --> 01:18:38,430
She said,
I've got no recollection.

1753
01:18:38,820 --> 01:18:40,890
They went to the guy and he said,
yes,

1754
01:18:40,891 --> 01:18:44,250
you want it to give me a blow job,
and she gave me a blow job when she was

1755
01:18:44,280 --> 01:18:45,270
like,
blackout drunk.

1756
01:18:45,540 --> 01:18:48,960
So she charges him for rape and the
Oklahoma court found that it wasn't

1757
01:18:49,470 --> 01:18:52,140
forcible rape,
so now they're having to change

1758
01:18:52,141 --> 01:18:55,260
Oklahoma's laws because the only thing
that it would have been that would have

1759
01:18:55,580 --> 01:18:57,180
like,
it basically has to be forcible.

1760
01:18:57,181 --> 01:18:58,800
It's called forceable sodomy.
Right.

1761
01:18:59,310 --> 01:19:02,580
And if the judge was saying if a victim
is so intoxicated that they are

1762
01:19:02,581 --> 01:19:05,760
completely unconscious,
then it's not actually forcible because

1763
01:19:05,761 --> 01:19:08,190
there's nothing like.
They weren't forced to do it.

1764
01:19:08,220 --> 01:19:11,540
They didn't even know that they were or
weren't doing it.

1765
01:19:13,050 --> 01:19:13,621
Jesus.
Well,

1766
01:19:13,621 --> 01:19:14,920
how do you define that then?
Well,

1767
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:15,840
exactly.
I don't know,

1768
01:19:15,930 --> 01:19:18,780
but I mean clearly you should not be
going around putting your Dick in

1769
01:19:18,781 --> 01:19:21,300
unconscious sixteen-year-olds mouths
clearly,

1770
01:19:21,540 --> 01:19:26,540
but at the same time I can sort of
understand that maybe it's not the same

1771
01:19:27,091 --> 01:19:32,091
level of horribleness as like just flat
out raping somebody.

1772
01:19:33,421 --> 01:19:33,730
There's

1773
01:19:33,730 --> 01:19:37,690
also the problem with the girl possibly
consenting at the time just being so

1774
01:19:37,691 --> 01:19:39,580
fucked up.
She doesn't remember consenting.

1775
01:19:39,581 --> 01:19:42,160
Right?
Especially she's 16 and it's one of her

1776
01:19:42,161 --> 01:19:46,630
first ever sexual experiences or first
ever drunk sexual experiences we should

1777
01:19:46,631 --> 01:19:47,620
assume.
Yes.

1778
01:19:47,621 --> 01:19:51,960
So it is entirely possible that this boy
who was only a few months older than her

1779
01:19:51,990 --> 01:19:54,940
didn't have the wherewithal to
understand that she was compromised to

1780
01:19:54,941 --> 01:19:57,220
the point where she couldn't consent.
So who,

1781
01:19:57,250 --> 01:20:01,840
who are both drunk,
that gets real weird.

1782
01:20:01,920 --> 01:20:05,590
It gets real weird and we don't know
exactly what words were exchanged.

1783
01:20:05,591 --> 01:20:08,610
What actually did happen,
what the history of these two together

1784
01:20:08,611 --> 01:20:09,840
was like.
We don't know.

1785
01:20:10,720 --> 01:20:11,471
I mean,
if I had to,

1786
01:20:11,471 --> 01:20:13,120
if I had a son,
I would have to say now,

1787
01:20:13,121 --> 01:20:15,930
just never ever have any sexual
relations with anybody who's

1788
01:20:15,990 --> 01:20:19,740
drunk because that's frankly,
it's like getting fucked when they're

1789
01:20:19,741 --> 01:20:21,600
drunk.
Guys like fucking their girlfriends when

1790
01:20:21,601 --> 01:20:22,540
they're drunk.
What do you mean?

1791
01:20:22,550 --> 01:20:26,010
Some everybody who like who didn't.
Who's early sexual experiences with,

1792
01:20:26,160 --> 01:20:27,660
with done sober what,
what have you.

1793
01:20:27,661 --> 01:20:31,170
You're both drunk like that's.
There was a big thing that feminists

1794
01:20:31,171 --> 01:20:33,990
were trying to push for a while and they
kind of abandoned it because they

1795
01:20:33,991 --> 01:20:38,040
realized that it literally makes 90
percent of the population a rapist and

1796
01:20:38,041 --> 01:20:40,230
they were saying you shouldn't have sex.
Even with your husband.

1797
01:20:40,440 --> 01:20:42,450
If your husband is drunk and you're
sober,

1798
01:20:42,451 --> 01:20:43,570
don't have sex with them.
Yeah.

1799
01:20:44,080 --> 01:20:47,980
Logistically saying that old drunk sex
is non consensual sex with because it's

1800
01:20:48,050 --> 01:20:48,750
full.
Makes it ripe.

1801
01:20:48,750 --> 01:20:51,240
You can't consent.
But then the argument becomes,

1802
01:20:51,241 --> 01:20:53,880
well,
how come you're responsible for driving

1803
01:20:53,881 --> 01:20:56,400
your car when you're drunk?
You're responsible for that.

1804
01:20:56,401 --> 01:20:58,350
If you get caught,
you're know you're not supposed to drive

1805
01:20:58,351 --> 01:20:59,160
your car when you're drunk.

1806
01:20:59,160 --> 01:20:59,851
It's not like,
oh,

1807
01:20:59,851 --> 01:21:02,160
I was too drunk.
I couldn't consent to drive my car.

1808
01:21:02,360 --> 01:21:03,210
No,
you're responsible.

1809
01:21:03,211 --> 01:21:05,520
You're a fucking adult.
You responsible for violence.

1810
01:21:05,521 --> 01:21:06,870
You can't beat somebody up and say,
well,

1811
01:21:06,871 --> 01:21:10,560
I didn't know I was drunk,
but when it comes to sexuality for

1812
01:21:10,561 --> 01:21:13,110
whatever reason,
you're not responsible for your actions.

1813
01:21:13,111 --> 01:21:14,580
If you're intoxicated,
well you are.

1814
01:21:14,581 --> 01:21:15,720
If you.
If you have the right pissed,

1815
01:21:15,750 --> 01:21:19,230
not just not the right p,
know that women were saying this is part

1816
01:21:19,231 --> 01:21:24,231
of the argument that of man fucks you
and he's drunk and you're sober.

1817
01:21:24,540 --> 01:21:27,390
Even though he's the.
He's the proactive one,

1818
01:21:27,420 --> 01:21:28,580
right?
That he's being.

1819
01:21:28,850 --> 01:21:30,600
He's being raped.
Yes.

1820
01:21:30,810 --> 01:21:35,340
That sex with a drunk person is rape
because they cannot consent.

1821
01:21:35,430 --> 01:21:36,810
Well then you might as well just as you
say,

1822
01:21:36,811 --> 01:21:39,000
make every single activity that you do
while drunk,

1823
01:21:39,210 --> 01:21:43,110
but the real problem becomes it becomes
an attack on men because it's very,

1824
01:21:43,111 --> 01:21:46,680
very rare that any woman ever gets in
trouble for having sex with a man that's

1825
01:21:46,681 --> 01:21:50,010
drunk,
but women and men have both been drunk

1826
01:21:50,040 --> 01:21:53,040
and the men have been accused of being
rapist.

1827
01:21:53,041 --> 01:21:55,990
Whereas a woman wasn't.
That was the Occidental University then.

1828
01:21:55,991 --> 01:21:56,824
Yeah,
that's right.

1829
01:21:57,330 --> 01:21:58,800
College or university?
What is it?

1830
01:21:58,801 --> 01:21:59,960
College College,
I think.

1831
01:21:59,980 --> 01:22:00,813
Yeah,
I think so.

1832
01:22:00,840 --> 01:22:03,150
Uh,
I mean that was the guy suing and

1833
01:22:03,151 --> 01:22:03,550
frustrated.

1834
01:22:03,550 --> 01:22:07,300
Let me so much because this is one of
those areas where like Islam or like

1835
01:22:07,301 --> 01:22:09,130
political correctness or like black
lives matter.

1836
01:22:09,160 --> 01:22:13,300
I feel like the moment you try to
introduce nuance you can be very quickly

1837
01:22:13,301 --> 01:22:16,930
taken out of context and accused of
being pro that thing like 100 percent,

1838
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:18,850
you know,
because I'll say something like this and

1839
01:22:18,851 --> 01:22:21,100
then peer supporters of mine on twitter
will be like,

1840
01:22:21,101 --> 01:22:22,620
yeah,
like fuck her.

1841
01:22:22,621 --> 01:22:23,250
Or like,
you know,

1842
01:22:23,250 --> 01:22:23,800
let's.
Right,

1843
01:22:23,800 --> 01:22:27,430
but the day that is not what I'm saying
that whatsoever.

1844
01:22:27,440 --> 01:22:30,350
That's why it's horrific that they can
take what you're doing right now and

1845
01:22:30,351 --> 01:22:32,420
take it and make a little youtube clip
out of it.

1846
01:22:32,450 --> 01:22:36,320
Take that clip and put a title on it.
Josh Zap thinks rapes.

1847
01:22:36,321 --> 01:22:37,340
Okay.
Exactly.

1848
01:22:37,400 --> 01:22:38,480
That's right.
It's really not.

1849
01:22:38,790 --> 01:22:40,670
I do think it's okay.
In fact,

1850
01:22:40,671 --> 01:22:42,530
I encourage everybody to go out and
write

1851
01:22:44,850 --> 01:22:48,250
a
funny,

1852
01:22:48,330 --> 01:22:49,610
funny,
no place for jokes.

1853
01:22:49,640 --> 01:22:50,390
No,
no,

1854
01:22:50,390 --> 01:22:51,650
no more.
No more jokes.

1855
01:22:51,651 --> 01:22:52,660
But a Dojo.

1856
01:22:52,860 --> 01:22:53,693
Yeah.
If like if,

1857
01:22:53,710 --> 01:22:58,260
if I were to say for example that a
preying upon somebody,

1858
01:22:58,261 --> 01:23:03,240
praying upon a woman with like a knife
and forcing her against her will to have

1859
01:23:03,241 --> 01:23:08,241
sex with you is a class of behavior then
coming in an unconscious in your

1860
01:23:11,051 --> 01:23:14,460
unconscious girlfriend's mouth.
Would that like is that,

1861
01:23:14,500 --> 01:23:16,270
is it.
Have we gotten to a stage where it's

1862
01:23:16,271 --> 01:23:19,420
just not possible to even talk about
that because we just have to keep

1863
01:23:19,421 --> 01:23:22,810
mouthing the slogan of sexual violence
is unacceptable all the time.

1864
01:23:22,811 --> 01:23:25,990
Therefore there's no way of even
distinguishing in the law between

1865
01:23:25,991 --> 01:23:27,370
different levels.
You know,

1866
01:23:27,400 --> 01:23:30,460
someone who had a boyfriend,
a 17 year old boyfriend who makes a

1867
01:23:30,461 --> 01:23:32,440
mistake,
should go to jail for just the same

1868
01:23:32,441 --> 01:23:37,390
length of time as a repeat serial
Predator who preys upon women.

1869
01:23:37,770 --> 01:23:39,870
Well,
we don't want to admit that there is any

1870
01:23:39,871 --> 01:23:43,950
difference and that all these things are
exactly the same and one of the reasons

1871
01:23:43,951 --> 01:23:47,130
why,
because because what you just said,

1872
01:23:47,160 --> 01:23:49,860
just even introducing it as a
possibility.

1873
01:23:49,861 --> 01:23:53,190
Like there might be a variation.
There might be a there,

1874
01:23:53,240 --> 01:23:56,910
there might be a grade of like,
this is a level 10 rate,

1875
01:23:56,911 --> 01:23:58,890
but this is a level nine rape.
This is level eight.

1876
01:23:59,340 --> 01:23:59,731
Like,
Whoa,

1877
01:23:59,731 --> 01:24:00,091
Whoa,
Whoa,

1878
01:24:00,091 --> 01:24:00,491
Whoa,
whoa,

1879
01:24:00,491 --> 01:24:00,931
Whoa,
whoa.

1880
01:24:00,931 --> 01:24:04,170
As soon as you start getting into that,
it's almost like you're a rape apologist

1881
01:24:04,230 --> 01:24:08,220
or you a rape supporter,
or we want to be able to boil things

1882
01:24:08,221 --> 01:24:12,060
until fucking headline a clickbait
headline and spit it out there.

1883
01:24:12,061 --> 01:24:14,490
Here's my thoughts on rape,
you know,

1884
01:24:14,491 --> 01:24:19,110
and that's why the idea of everyone
who's drunk is getting raped is so

1885
01:24:19,111 --> 01:24:23,700
ridiculous because it's like we've all
been with someone that we love and we

1886
01:24:23,701 --> 01:24:26,190
got drunk and we wanted to have sex with
them when we did.

1887
01:24:26,370 --> 01:24:27,130
No one got raped.

1888
01:24:27,130 --> 01:24:28,330
Well,
and it's not only ridiculous,

1889
01:24:28,331 --> 01:24:30,970
it's also demeaning to the victims of
really terrible,

1890
01:24:30,971 --> 01:24:31,480
right?
Yes.

1891
01:24:31,480 --> 01:24:32,021
Right.
I mean,

1892
01:24:32,021 --> 01:24:36,280
it's also diminishes.
They have their legitimate concern.

1893
01:24:36,320 --> 01:24:40,550
It's also insanely sexist because it
shows women as being these people that

1894
01:24:40,551 --> 01:24:43,340
can't make good decisions while they're
intoxicated.

1895
01:24:43,580 --> 01:24:45,560
Whereas the men know exactly what
they're doing,

1896
01:24:45,561 --> 01:24:48,290
so they raped the woman.
So the man and the women,

1897
01:24:48,291 --> 01:24:50,210
even though they're both engaging in the
exact same,

1898
01:24:50,510 --> 01:24:54,080
the exact same act,
they're both saying they want to do it.

1899
01:24:54,500 --> 01:24:57,020
The man is the,
he's the attacker.

1900
01:24:57,470 --> 01:25:00,310
Whereas the woman is an innocent person
who doesn't know any better because

1901
01:25:00,311 --> 01:25:01,040
she's drunk.

1902
01:25:01,040 --> 01:25:03,860
There was a pace on the other.
I was waiting on the plane in the Sunday

1903
01:25:03,860 --> 01:25:04,461
Times,
uh,

1904
01:25:04,461 --> 01:25:08,360
yesterday about the woods survivor.
How the woods survivor has been,

1905
01:25:08,420 --> 01:25:09,830
has,
is getting used now.

1906
01:25:09,831 --> 01:25:12,400
It was really interesting patients in
the New York Times magazine almost with

1907
01:25:12,410 --> 01:25:14,480
survivor.
I am.

1908
01:25:14,481 --> 01:25:18,680
I had the flu and they were making the
point that like when everything,

1909
01:25:18,770 --> 01:25:22,160
when every act of sexual violence gets,
gets labeled with,

1910
01:25:22,161 --> 01:25:25,640
I'm a survivor of sexual violence.
Even if that was just unwanted touching

1911
01:25:25,641 --> 01:25:27,860
on the subway,
then like,

1912
01:25:27,861 --> 01:25:30,590
what does it mean to be.
What do you mean you survived it?

1913
01:25:30,620 --> 01:25:32,690
Were you ever.
Were you ever going to die because

1914
01:25:32,691 --> 01:25:34,910
someone likes slapped you on the ass in
the workplace?

1915
01:25:35,150 --> 01:25:37,100
Not to,
not to say that it's okay to do that,

1916
01:25:37,370 --> 01:25:39,770
but again,
you're just compressing all of the

1917
01:25:39,771 --> 01:25:44,771
actual real horrifying survival stories
down to the level of someone looked at

1918
01:25:45,591 --> 01:25:46,424
me funny and

1919
01:25:47,280 --> 01:25:48,670
yeah,
you can't call it survival,

1920
01:25:49,270 --> 01:25:51,400
but you're a victim.
Yeah.

1921
01:25:51,550 --> 01:25:53,830
Yeah.
Bit survivor sounds better.

1922
01:25:54,080 --> 01:25:56,140
It sounds much use.
You're barely made it.

1923
01:25:57,490 --> 01:26:00,280
Survivor of bullying.
I saw that someone someone wrote were a

1924
01:26:00,281 --> 01:26:02,590
survivor of high school bullying.
Yeah.

1925
01:26:02,710 --> 01:26:04,310
What the fuck happened to you?
What?

1926
01:26:04,311 --> 01:26:06,680
What was so bad?
What did someone try to stab you?

1927
01:26:06,681 --> 01:26:10,430
Did somebody beat you up to the point of
view almost dying or did someone just

1928
01:26:10,431 --> 01:26:12,350
annoy you all the time and make you feel
bad?

1929
01:26:12,560 --> 01:26:13,230
Is that what happened?

1930
01:26:13,230 --> 01:26:15,060
There are a few.
There are only a few scenarios in which

1931
01:26:15,061 --> 01:26:16,980
I think you should legitimately be
called a survivor.

1932
01:26:17,010 --> 01:26:19,690
A bear attack wouldn't be one of them.
Shark attack,

1933
01:26:19,740 --> 01:26:20,970
shark attack.
Another one.

1934
01:26:20,971 --> 01:26:25,040
Basically any kind of large carnivorous
animal attacking you online.

1935
01:26:25,190 --> 01:26:26,800
You man done.
You go through it,

1936
01:26:26,801 --> 01:26:30,960
but through them all tiger or leopard,
monkey.

1937
01:26:33,380 --> 01:26:34,890
Mayor Killed by monkeys.
Really?

1938
01:26:35,300 --> 01:26:37,630
She here that maybe we'll the olive
African,

1939
01:26:37,650 --> 01:26:39,300
African elephants are going to be dead
in 20 years.

1940
01:26:39,680 --> 01:26:41,850
What?
That's what I was reading an article.

1941
01:26:41,910 --> 01:26:44,490
They were saying there's places in
Africa that have so many elephants.

1942
01:26:44,491 --> 01:26:45,620
They have to kill them.
Yeah,

1943
01:26:45,630 --> 01:26:47,340
I know.
But there is enormous.

1944
01:26:47,341 --> 01:26:50,010
This is one of the things that people
don't understand.

1945
01:26:50,250 --> 01:26:55,230
Why is he in an area of Africa?
Africa itself is fucking huge.

1946
01:26:55,231 --> 01:26:56,820
Yes.
And there's a conference with all of the

1947
01:26:56,821 --> 01:26:57,840
people who are.
There we go.

1948
01:26:57,990 --> 01:27:00,030
No magazine.
African Americans could be extinct

1949
01:27:00,031 --> 01:27:00,840
within 20 days

1950
01:27:00,840 --> 01:27:03,510
if poaching maybe

1951
01:27:03,730 --> 01:27:04,730
because all of the,
uh,

1952
01:27:04,780 --> 01:27:08,090
there's a conference of African leaders
at the moment going on to figure out how

1953
01:27:08,091 --> 01:27:08,720
they can,
uh,

1954
01:27:08,720 --> 01:27:10,670
they can tackle poaching.
Wow.

1955
01:27:10,910 --> 01:27:13,320
But Africa is a continent.
It's fun.

1956
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:16,730
Enormous city.
It's bigger than almost all the

1957
01:27:16,731 --> 01:27:18,200
continents combined.
I know.

1958
01:27:18,201 --> 01:27:21,020
But if you keep killing them at a much
larger rate than they procreate,

1959
01:27:21,021 --> 01:27:22,910
so over time you're going to wipe them
all out.

1960
01:27:23,090 --> 01:27:25,700
What's scary is people are still hunting
them.

1961
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:27,410
Yeah.
On top of the poaching.

1962
01:27:28,310 --> 01:27:31,880
So there's,
there's these places that develop

1963
01:27:32,240 --> 01:27:37,190
African hunting safaris for elephants.
So they raise elephants in these high

1964
01:27:37,191 --> 01:27:41,780
fence operations just so people can go
over there and hunt them and that's one

1965
01:27:41,781 --> 01:27:44,600
of the ways that they ensure that their
population stay high.

1966
01:27:44,601 --> 01:27:46,290
It's very fucking twisted.
Right?

1967
01:27:46,370 --> 01:27:48,790
Trump's kids,
you've seen those photos of trump's sons

1968
01:27:48,791 --> 01:27:51,150
holding our son Shit.
Holding up Jaguars and yeah,

1969
01:27:51,790 --> 01:27:53,410
that whole African hunting thing.
I.

1970
01:27:53,860 --> 01:27:58,860
I tell people if you think it's bizarre
with from a cursory glance,

1971
01:28:00,940 --> 01:28:03,760
you gotta look at Luther's documentary
about these

1972
01:28:03,990 --> 01:28:05,610
good honey.
We mentioned this before because I've

1973
01:28:05,611 --> 01:28:08,430
been a fan since day since day one,
but that,

1974
01:28:08,431 --> 01:28:09,540
that episode is just

1975
01:28:09,710 --> 01:28:11,380
killer.
That one's nuts.

1976
01:28:11,381 --> 01:28:13,720
I love the end of it.
When the guy's going crazy,

1977
01:28:13,721 --> 01:28:15,460
you need to ask him all the questions
was like Africa,

1978
01:28:15,461 --> 01:28:16,600
he's fucked,
fucked.

1979
01:28:16,660 --> 01:28:19,630
He's fit.
You don't understand content.

1980
01:28:19,860 --> 01:28:21,880
It is fucked.
And when he was saying that,

1981
01:28:22,070 --> 01:28:25,600
really kind of get it.
I hate that term.

1982
01:28:25,601 --> 01:28:30,010
Poacher two poachers that dark term
because a lot of those people that are

1983
01:28:30,011 --> 01:28:34,210
poaching or just fucking starving,
they're poor as fuck.

1984
01:28:34,270 --> 01:28:36,850
We have this idea that these are like
these mercenaries that come over to

1985
01:28:36,851 --> 01:28:39,220
steal ivory so they can make money off
of it.

1986
01:28:39,221 --> 01:28:41,770
There's a lot of people that are killing
these animals that are homeless,

1987
01:28:41,771 --> 01:28:45,190
have no way out.
There's nothing there for them.

1988
01:28:45,191 --> 01:28:46,960
They don't know any better.
They're not educated.

1989
01:28:47,230 --> 01:28:48,940
They're just starving and someone says,
Hey,

1990
01:28:49,190 --> 01:28:51,670
you give me that Rhino Horn.
I'll give you 500 bucks,

1991
01:28:51,880 --> 01:28:53,110
and they're like,
Holy Shit,

1992
01:28:53,111 --> 01:28:56,410
500 bucks,
and then they'll kill as many rhinos as

1993
01:28:56,411 --> 01:28:57,610
they can before they get killed.

1994
01:28:57,610 --> 01:29:00,940
It's so dark.
I have a friend who went over there.

1995
01:29:01,350 --> 01:29:06,350
You went over there to Africa and he
said he was on a hunting safari where

1996
01:29:08,670 --> 01:29:13,670
they have these enormous places where
they have these hunting camps where

1997
01:29:14,190 --> 01:29:17,010
there it's a 10 hour drive to the other
side of the ranch.

1998
01:29:17,040 --> 01:29:21,390
I mean enormous,
enormous territory and while they were

1999
01:29:21,391 --> 01:29:24,270
there,
they encountered these quote unquote

2000
01:29:24,271 --> 01:29:29,230
poachers and he said,
the people from the honey cam just shoot

2001
01:29:29,231 --> 01:29:30,060
it.
The poachers,

2002
01:29:30,060 --> 01:29:32,160
they just shoot at them like the
coyotes.

2003
01:29:32,730 --> 01:29:34,590
They shoot it.
These people like,

2004
01:29:35,370 --> 01:29:36,900
I mean they don't even give them a
chance,

2005
01:29:36,930 --> 01:29:39,600
they just shoot at them and they're
allowed to.

2006
01:29:39,630 --> 01:29:41,580
It's illegal and when they shoot
someone,

2007
01:29:41,670 --> 01:29:43,920
he asked him like,
what do you do if you kill someone?

2008
01:29:44,340 --> 01:29:47,020
And he's like,
most of the time we let the hyenas

2009
01:29:47,040 --> 01:29:50,820
sorted out.
Most of the time we let the hyenas

2010
01:29:50,821 --> 01:29:53,730
short.
Let me just think about how fucking

2011
01:29:53,731 --> 01:29:58,731
crazy life is in that part of the world
that this guy is actually saying that

2012
01:29:59,580 --> 01:30:03,090
we're pretty fucking lucky and I'm
guessing that trump's kids are probably

2013
01:30:03,091 --> 01:30:05,550
not that poor that they need to be
hunting that way.

2014
01:30:05,760 --> 01:30:07,820
They're over there doing those.
Um,

2015
01:30:08,040 --> 01:30:09,360
big game so far.

2016
01:30:09,430 --> 01:30:10,870
Yeah.
There's one is a photo of one of them

2017
01:30:10,871 --> 01:30:13,600
holding up an elephant's trunk.
Just the,

2018
01:30:13,630 --> 01:30:16,440
just the dismembered trunk.
Just a big old nose just hanging in

2019
01:30:16,441 --> 01:30:17,640
there because little shit.
What?

2020
01:30:17,680 --> 01:30:20,980
Trump couldn't
pull that up.

2021
01:30:21,030 --> 01:30:22,230
I want to see it.
Yeah,

2022
01:30:22,290 --> 01:30:24,300
I do.
I do know that they've had to kill

2023
01:30:24,301 --> 01:30:27,030
elephants,
certain areas that have infiltrated

2024
01:30:27,031 --> 01:30:32,031
these villages and start killing people.
But the question is what,

2025
01:30:32,730 --> 01:30:35,460
how,
how fucked with did they get before they

2026
01:30:35,461 --> 01:30:37,710
started killing people?
Like what's the actual reality?

2027
01:30:37,940 --> 01:30:39,220
Well,
I mean as you,

2028
01:30:39,280 --> 01:30:41,100
as you say,
like what's the reality of the human

2029
01:30:41,101 --> 01:30:42,600
beings line?
So we're doing this as well.

2030
01:30:42,601 --> 01:30:43,890
I was just in a,
I would,

2031
01:30:43,920 --> 01:30:47,510
when I was coming back from Australia,
I spent a week in India and uh,

2032
01:30:47,550 --> 01:30:51,810
in Mumbai did,
there's this company that does a tools

2033
01:30:51,811 --> 01:30:55,680
of the biggest slum in Asia,
like the kind of slumdog millionaire

2034
01:30:55,980 --> 01:30:56,701
slum.
And they,

2035
01:30:56,701 --> 01:30:59,610
and they work in development there with
some of the poorest people in the world.

2036
01:30:59,970 --> 01:31:01,950
There's an area,
it's an area of the site,

2037
01:31:02,010 --> 01:31:05,250
it's called Dharavi and it's in Mumbai,
it's the,

2038
01:31:05,520 --> 01:31:09,240
it's one of the biggest slums in the
world and it's an area the size of half

2039
01:31:09,241 --> 01:31:12,330
the size of central park and it's got
like 2 million people living in it.

2040
01:31:12,570 --> 01:31:15,750
Jesus.
And they do development stuff there.

2041
01:31:15,751 --> 01:31:20,650
And you can walk through and these,
I mean you feel a little bit weird like

2042
01:31:20,670 --> 01:31:24,510
going through this place,
like it's almost like disaster porn or

2043
01:31:24,511 --> 01:31:27,750
something like huge canals which just
smell.

2044
01:31:27,751 --> 01:31:31,920
It's just shit and like dead dogs and
peace and just just,

2045
01:31:32,010 --> 01:31:33,930
I mean,
but you know,

2046
01:31:33,931 --> 01:31:37,070
what people are getting on with life,
the law firm,

2047
01:31:37,330 --> 01:31:39,330
there are,
there are soccer balls that plan with

2048
01:31:39,390 --> 01:31:39,960
like,
you know,

2049
01:31:39,960 --> 01:31:44,880
kids are scrounging around in the dust
and the dirt and the grime people.

2050
01:31:45,750 --> 01:31:48,780
People are fucking resilient in amazing
ways.

2051
01:31:48,940 --> 01:31:52,660
Well they weren't.
We wouldn't be here because it's 2016

2052
01:31:52,661 --> 01:31:55,150
shit where you go to the supermarket and
you buy a chicken breast.

2053
01:31:55,180 --> 01:31:59,070
A wish.
So out of touch touch the most recent of

2054
01:31:59,350 --> 01:32:01,690
recent.
I mean that's one of the more amazing

2055
01:32:01,691 --> 01:32:04,300
things about how upset people are about
how life is today.

2056
01:32:04,301 --> 01:32:06,560
Like God damn it,
it's the easiest it's ever been ever.

2057
01:32:06,880 --> 01:32:09,850
This is the greatest time in the history
of the world.

2058
01:32:09,990 --> 01:32:11,230
Yeah.
And everyone's.

2059
01:32:11,231 --> 01:32:12,370
The Sky's falling

2060
01:32:12,410 --> 01:32:15,110
when we don't.
And as our lives get better and better,

2061
01:32:15,140 --> 01:32:18,380
we don't.
We fail to accurately calibrate like

2062
01:32:18,381 --> 01:32:19,460
any,
any benchmark.

2063
01:32:19,461 --> 01:32:21,890
Like you always.
It's like there was a study that came

2064
01:32:21,891 --> 01:32:26,891
out that 47 percent of Americans could
not come up with $400 if they needed to.

2065
01:32:27,080 --> 01:32:29,260
If they suddenly got an unexpected bill,
right?

2066
01:32:29,300 --> 01:32:33,260
Almost half of Americans in other words
are right on the brink of the poverty

2067
01:32:33,261 --> 01:32:35,930
line,
but in terms of just being able to come

2068
01:32:35,931 --> 01:32:38,930
up with cash,
but how do we get into and get ourselves

2069
01:32:38,931 --> 01:32:40,300
into that scenario?
We,

2070
01:32:40,330 --> 01:32:44,180
we fail to recognize how prosperous we
are.

2071
01:32:44,181 --> 01:32:45,650
I mean,
if most of the people who are listening

2072
01:32:45,651 --> 01:32:49,580
to this podcast are in the top five
percent of income earners globally,

2073
01:32:50,330 --> 01:32:54,030
more than a lot of them will be in the
top one percent and the top one percent,

2074
01:32:54,040 --> 01:32:58,040
20,
34 grand a year of global global

2075
01:32:58,041 --> 01:32:58,874
incomes.
Is it?

2076
01:32:58,960 --> 01:32:59,810
Okay.
So there you go.

2077
01:33:00,280 --> 01:33:04,250
And even even within the United States,
I mean the top five percent is,

2078
01:33:04,310 --> 01:33:07,370
is surprisingly low.
It's like 50 grand or something.

2079
01:33:07,620 --> 01:33:08,600
Well,
I think it's more than that,

2080
01:33:08,700 --> 01:33:12,210
but I think it's like mm.
I thought it was either way.

2081
01:33:13,400 --> 01:33:16,070
Either way.
We are incredibly blessed and amazingly

2082
01:33:16,071 --> 01:33:20,210
fortunate and it's so hard to snip
hassles out of our complacency and

2083
01:33:20,211 --> 01:33:23,570
realize fuck.
Things actually are surprisingly

2084
01:33:23,870 --> 01:33:27,290
convenient and easy for us.

2085
01:33:27,590 --> 01:33:30,020
Yeah,
I'm gonna stop whining overall,

2086
01:33:30,110 --> 01:33:31,760
but if you're.
One of those people that can't come up

2087
01:33:31,761 --> 01:33:34,460
with that 400 bucks and the $400 bill
comes,

2088
01:33:34,461 --> 01:33:35,370
it seems daunting.

2089
01:33:35,500 --> 01:33:37,240
Yes.
And I'm not blaming,

2090
01:33:37,510 --> 01:33:38,710
blaming people for it.
I've been in,

2091
01:33:38,740 --> 01:33:41,290
I've had times in my life where I've
been below,

2092
01:33:41,410 --> 01:33:43,090
you know,
wellwell onto water.

2093
01:33:43,390 --> 01:33:44,230
Sure.
We all have.

2094
01:33:44,231 --> 01:33:47,110
But I think that's also probably one of
the reasons why you became ambitious and

2095
01:33:47,111 --> 01:33:50,110
why you worked hard and why you're in a
position right now where you don't have

2096
01:33:50,111 --> 01:33:51,160
to worry about that.
Yeah.

2097
01:33:51,220 --> 01:33:53,890
Because you worked your way through it
and you figure your way through

2098
01:33:53,891 --> 01:33:55,030
adversity,
you know,

2099
01:33:55,860 --> 01:33:57,870
has an interesting subject because,
um,

2100
01:33:58,270 --> 01:34:01,150
I had uh,
Eddie Wong in really recently and he

2101
01:34:01,151 --> 01:34:03,010
brought up something that I thought was
preposterous.

2102
01:34:03,250 --> 01:34:05,900
He brought up the idea of what do they
call it,

2103
01:34:05,910 --> 01:34:10,390
basic income where you give people
$35,000 a year to live.

2104
01:34:10,391 --> 01:34:11,860
And I was like,
get the fuck Outta here.

2105
01:34:12,190 --> 01:34:15,910
But then I started looking into it and
when I started looking into it,

2106
01:34:15,940 --> 01:34:18,610
one of the things that I was intrigued
by was like,

2107
01:34:18,611 --> 01:34:22,690
okay,
how much of crime and how much of

2108
01:34:22,691 --> 01:34:27,691
people's aberrant behavior could be.
You could write it off to them being

2109
01:34:29,411 --> 01:34:34,411
desperate and needy and poor and feeling
hopeless and how much of that crime

2110
01:34:35,681 --> 01:34:40,360
would not take place if they got $35,000
a year and if these are people that are

2111
01:34:40,361 --> 01:34:43,510
just going to fuck off anyway,
but this way they're gonna fuck off,

2112
01:34:43,511 --> 01:34:46,270
but they won't be committing crime
because they're going to have a steady

2113
01:34:46,271 --> 01:34:48,010
income for the rest of their life.

2114
01:34:48,790 --> 01:34:51,820
Is that feasible?
Like how much money is there out there?

2115
01:34:51,970 --> 01:34:56,290
Could you give everybody in America
$35,000 a year up to a certain number,

2116
01:34:56,300 --> 01:34:57,990
right?
Once you hit a cutoff,

2117
01:34:58,040 --> 01:35:00,950
like you hit like I would say like a
quarter million dollars a year,

2118
01:35:00,951 --> 01:35:03,160
you don't get the 35 grand anymore.
Like you have plenty of money.

2119
01:35:03,400 --> 01:35:06,230
Here's the.
Here's the thing that the great utility

2120
01:35:06,231 --> 01:35:09,320
of a basic income is that you don't have
to fill out forms and prove that you

2121
01:35:09,321 --> 01:35:11,350
deserve it,
that everybody gets it because it's so.

2122
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:12,470
It's super,
super simple.

2123
01:35:12,471 --> 01:35:13,730
Where's it coming from?
Well,

2124
01:35:13,780 --> 01:35:16,070
yes.
You can't start with $35,000 a year,

2125
01:35:16,100 --> 01:35:18,620
but you can.
I've heard proposals,

2126
01:35:18,650 --> 01:35:20,270
look,
Alaska has this already.

2127
01:35:20,400 --> 01:35:25,400
They just call it an oil revenue.
Everyone in Alaska gets a check from the

2128
01:35:25,761 --> 01:35:28,760
government,
which is a cut of Alaska's oil revenue.

2129
01:35:28,761 --> 01:35:30,980
They basically get a universal basic
income.

2130
01:35:30,981 --> 01:35:33,350
It's not nearly enough to live on.
It might be a thousand dollars a year or

2131
01:35:33,351 --> 01:35:34,940
something.
I'll be corrected on this,

2132
01:35:35,300 --> 01:35:39,170
but there are all kinds of experiments.
I had Felix Salmon on my podcast.

2133
01:35:39,170 --> 01:35:40,490
Who's at?
Who's over at slate?

2134
01:35:40,491 --> 01:35:41,540
I don't know if you know him.
He's a.

2135
01:35:41,600 --> 01:35:42,770
he's a money.
A big,

2136
01:35:42,920 --> 01:35:46,030
very interesting money guy.
He has a podcast called the money put

2137
01:35:46,100 --> 01:35:49,830
the slate money podcast and he's a big
advocate of this idea and there's a.

2138
01:35:51,080 --> 01:35:51,621
yeah,
you should.

2139
01:35:51,621 --> 01:35:53,420
You should get him on and he's great.
He's based out of New York,

2140
01:35:53,421 --> 01:35:56,090
but he's Felix Salmon.
Like the fish,

2141
01:35:56,580 --> 01:35:57,510
I'll,
I'll send you his.

2142
01:35:57,890 --> 01:35:59,960
I'll text you his details after,
after the show.

2143
01:36:00,310 --> 01:36:02,750
Um,
I'm making a note to myself right now.

2144
01:36:03,050 --> 01:36:06,100
Uh,
and that he was basically saying there's

2145
01:36:06,110 --> 01:36:09,650
a place in like there's a jurisdiction
and I think Finland or Sweden,

2146
01:36:09,651 --> 01:36:13,400
which has actually trying this out just
to test the proposition of like how much

2147
01:36:13,401 --> 01:36:17,780
less will people actually work.
If everyone gets a basic income,

2148
01:36:18,110 --> 01:36:21,740
how much of a deterrent will it be
bothering to get a job?

2149
01:36:21,890 --> 01:36:23,260
How much will it cost?
Well,

2150
01:36:23,300 --> 01:36:27,350
$35,000 a year would be would be a lot
of money.

2151
01:36:27,410 --> 01:36:29,900
Well,
30,000 times 300 million

2152
01:36:34,400 --> 01:36:37,910
is the thing you would start.
It are a lot of savings,

2153
01:36:37,911 --> 01:36:39,620
right?
So here's the weird thing about this

2154
01:36:39,621 --> 01:36:42,890
idea is that libertarians like it as
well as progressives because for

2155
01:36:42,891 --> 01:36:44,840
Libertarians,
this is a way of getting rid of social

2156
01:36:44,841 --> 01:36:46,040
security,
getting rid of Medicare,

2157
01:36:46,050 --> 01:36:48,470
getting rid of food stamps,
getting rid of all of these different

2158
01:36:48,471 --> 01:36:50,930
programs and streamlining everything.
I mean,

2159
01:36:50,931 --> 01:36:54,530
think of how hard it is to do your taxes
and to like to fill in the forms and to

2160
01:36:54,531 --> 01:36:58,130
figure out what you're supposed to get.
This would just be a check from the

2161
01:36:58,131 --> 01:36:59,360
government.
Everybody gets it,

2162
01:36:59,390 --> 01:37:02,210
no questions asked.
You go out and you buy what you need to

2163
01:37:02,211 --> 01:37:04,610
buy.
Now with healthcare is expensive as it

2164
01:37:04,611 --> 01:37:07,400
is in the United States.
That's not going to work for old people.

2165
01:37:07,400 --> 01:37:10,250
They're going to be able to pay for our
healthcare and health insurance and also

2166
01:37:10,310 --> 01:37:12,890
social security and also survive on
$35,000 a year,

2167
01:37:13,310 --> 01:37:15,920
but if you just thinking in terms of the
budget,

2168
01:37:16,190 --> 01:37:18,800
if you got rid of those massive line
items in the budget,

2169
01:37:18,860 --> 01:37:22,550
medicare and social security and so on,
then you will be able to start to think

2170
01:37:22,551 --> 01:37:25,550
about affording things like that.
So you might start with just $10,000 a

2171
01:37:25,551 --> 01:37:30,551
year for everybody and work your way up
from there and just test it.

2172
01:37:30,651 --> 01:37:32,600
I think a stat,
I think one of the states should start

2173
01:37:32,601 --> 01:37:35,630
to do it on a.
on a more aggressive level,

2174
01:37:35,631 --> 01:37:38,780
just like Colorado is going to be
playing around with universal healthcare

2175
01:37:39,050 --> 01:37:41,680
at the November election because we'd
baby,

2176
01:37:42,520 --> 01:37:44,450
we'd money.
Come on son.

2177
01:37:44,810 --> 01:37:47,070
I love it.
I think it's an interesting idea of

2178
01:37:47,120 --> 01:37:51,080
Colorado decided to do that and decided
to give every state resident $35,000 a

2179
01:37:51,081 --> 01:37:53,120
year.
The problem would be everybody moved.

2180
01:37:53,150 --> 01:37:54,110
Everybody moved there,
right?

2181
01:37:54,111 --> 01:37:54,620
Yeah.
But,

2182
01:37:54,620 --> 01:37:56,070
but I

2183
01:37:56,070 --> 01:38:00,000
think this is a possible solution to the
rise of robots

2184
01:38:01,510 --> 01:38:06,510
that's not as crazy as crazy as
it sounds like.

2185
01:38:08,611 --> 01:38:12,850
I've just been smoking weed at the time.
Um,

2186
01:38:14,160 --> 01:38:16,740
I,
I think that they were going to be fewer

2187
01:38:16,741 --> 01:38:21,741
and fewer jobs for individual human
beings as robots get better and better

2188
01:38:22,201 --> 01:38:23,650
at making shit.
No,

2189
01:38:23,670 --> 01:38:26,310
I think everybody believes that and also
that they're going to be cheaper and

2190
01:38:26,311 --> 01:38:27,810
cheaper to get robots.
Yeah.

2191
01:38:28,110 --> 01:38:31,380
And so what happens when you've got a,
you know,

2192
01:38:31,740 --> 01:38:36,740
silicon valley and Hollywood pumping out
huge amounts of stuff which,

2193
01:38:37,230 --> 01:38:41,310
which give us a massive GDP.
A larger GDP growth is still happening,

2194
01:38:41,700 --> 01:38:43,680
but it takes fewer and fewer people.
I mean,

2195
01:38:43,740 --> 01:38:46,530
Uber is a transportation company that
doesn't employ anybody.

2196
01:38:46,531 --> 01:38:48,840
Facebook doesn't employ very many
people.

2197
01:38:48,870 --> 01:38:51,840
Uber's been challenged on that.
That gets really problematic when you

2198
01:38:51,841 --> 01:38:54,090
deal without the actual labor laws and
things.

2199
01:38:54,090 --> 01:38:56,100
One.
But that's one particular scenario.

2200
01:38:56,250 --> 01:38:59,340
I think one thing that's happening
that's interesting is that people are

2201
01:38:59,341 --> 01:39:03,900
gravitating more towards craftsmanship
and crafts and people are gravitating

2202
01:39:03,901 --> 01:39:08,010
towards handmade things and they're
gravitating towards things that actually

2203
01:39:08,011 --> 01:39:09,330
have.
Like if somebody.

2204
01:39:09,560 --> 01:39:12,360
Like if I go to a store and I buy a
knife,

2205
01:39:12,480 --> 01:39:13,950
okay,
I buy a kitchen knife,

2206
01:39:14,430 --> 01:39:15,180
um,
you know,

2207
01:39:15,180 --> 01:39:16,560
it's nice,
it cuts my vegetables.

2208
01:39:16,800 --> 01:39:21,780
But if I know a guy who's a blacksmith
and he actually makes a knife and he and

2209
01:39:21,820 --> 01:39:24,750
he does all this craftsmanship and puts
together the handle.

2210
01:39:24,751 --> 01:39:29,751
And that to me is like there's a feeling
that you get from this object when

2211
01:39:29,851 --> 01:39:33,090
you're using it.
Like this is someone's craftsmanship.

2212
01:39:33,091 --> 01:39:36,540
This is someone's creation.
Someone learned a trade.

2213
01:39:36,750 --> 01:39:41,750
They learned the art form of making a,
a functional piece of kitchen ware.

2214
01:39:43,470 --> 01:39:46,350
And I'm using it here.
But speaking of the 47 percent of people

2215
01:39:46,351 --> 01:39:48,420
who kind of come up with $400,
I mean you,

2216
01:39:48,480 --> 01:39:50,940
you can afford to care about such
things,

2217
01:39:50,941 --> 01:39:53,820
but the majority of people are just
going to buy a pack of steak knives for

2218
01:39:53,821 --> 01:39:55,050
1499 at Walmart.

2219
01:39:55,050 --> 01:39:55,741
Right?
That's true.

2220
01:39:55,741 --> 01:39:57,090
But that's also the case with
everything,

2221
01:39:57,091 --> 01:39:59,040
with clothes and with all sorts of
different things.

2222
01:39:59,041 --> 01:40:03,230
But for the person themselves,
someone who learns a trade and someone

2223
01:40:03,231 --> 01:40:04,690
who learns a crap,
someone that learns how to make

2224
01:40:05,070 --> 01:40:07,410
furniture,
I hopefully go more that way and become

2225
01:40:07,411 --> 01:40:11,130
less of a disposable.
Just China fueled like commodity

2226
01:40:11,520 --> 01:40:14,970
consuming country and becoming cameron
about the quality of stuff.

2227
01:40:15,030 --> 01:40:17,520
In some ways I think we are for people
who can afford it.

2228
01:40:17,830 --> 01:40:21,450
I think it's becoming for the people
that are looking for something to do

2229
01:40:21,780 --> 01:40:25,920
like the that has meaning in their life.
There's like extreme meaning and hand

2230
01:40:25,921 --> 01:40:28,920
produced.
Things like when you buy something from

2231
01:40:28,921 --> 01:40:31,410
someone like a,
a piece of office furniture and you

2232
01:40:31,411 --> 01:40:33,620
know,
this guy made it like someone made my

2233
01:40:33,630 --> 01:40:36,150
friend Eric made this table.
Yeah.

2234
01:40:36,490 --> 01:40:38,730
Unless table.
We hired them to do it.

2235
01:40:38,790 --> 01:40:39,670
Yeah.
He got on your mind.

2236
01:40:39,690 --> 01:40:41,760
Not only that,
look at the fucking welding and all the

2237
01:40:41,761 --> 01:40:43,800
different shit to it.
I mean this guy,

2238
01:40:43,870 --> 01:40:48,870
he did an awesome job in,
in creating this and there's.

2239
01:40:49,830 --> 01:40:52,950
There's like something to someone making
something.

2240
01:40:53,200 --> 01:40:54,460
You're always going to remember

2241
01:40:54,460 --> 01:40:55,470
where it came from.
Yeah,

2242
01:40:55,471 --> 01:40:56,950
that's right.
It's a cutting board.

2243
01:40:57,200 --> 01:41:00,340
Somebody puts together a nice hard wood
cutting board,

2244
01:41:00,700 --> 01:41:01,420
you know,
like you like,

2245
01:41:01,420 --> 01:41:02,830
oh,
this is a guy made this.

2246
01:41:02,960 --> 01:41:04,820
Well maybe,
and then in terms of the question of

2247
01:41:04,821 --> 01:41:06,890
whether or not people can afford to buy
such things,

2248
01:41:06,891 --> 01:41:11,390
maybe the universal basic income means
that we don't necessarily have to all be

2249
01:41:11,450 --> 01:41:13,880
buying those things because the people
who make them are going to be getting

2250
01:41:13,881 --> 01:41:17,420
the universal income.
This is the theory which is that the.

2251
01:41:17,421 --> 01:41:21,620
If the overall pie is bigger every year,
then you just have to figure out how to

2252
01:41:21,621 --> 01:41:24,020
allocate the tax.
That Pie.

2253
01:41:24,050 --> 01:41:27,560
Maybe that means that you have to have
super huge taxes on silicon valley in

2254
01:41:27,561 --> 01:41:30,830
some way in order to fund the universal
basic income,

2255
01:41:30,831 --> 01:41:34,940
but if there aren't enough people being
employed to fund what the government

2256
01:41:34,941 --> 01:41:37,670
needs to do on the basis of a
conventional income tax,

2257
01:41:37,910 --> 01:41:40,820
but there's more stuff being produced
going around,

2258
01:41:40,821 --> 01:41:43,310
there's more wealth,
you should still be able to extract that

2259
01:41:43,311 --> 01:41:47,630
well somehow and maybe people can.
More people can if everyone got a

2260
01:41:47,631 --> 01:41:50,960
universal basic income and people can
become a poet or an autism,

2261
01:41:50,961 --> 01:41:55,160
all knife maker or a table maker and
they don't need to necessarily be able

2262
01:41:55,161 --> 01:41:58,040
to sustain their living doing that.
There are more opportunities for

2263
01:41:58,041 --> 01:41:58,874
creative

2264
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:02,360
output.
What's interesting to me is that it

2265
01:42:02,420 --> 01:42:05,630
might relax.
People I think will certainly.

2266
01:42:05,680 --> 01:42:07,670
Yeah.
I mean imagine not having to worry about

2267
01:42:07,671 --> 01:42:08,840
where the next meal comes from.
Well,

2268
01:42:08,850 --> 01:42:11,510
that's where it started ringing true to
me.

2269
01:42:11,511 --> 01:42:13,550
Like I was making fun of Eddie talking
about it,

2270
01:42:13,551 --> 01:42:16,730
but then I thought about it for quite a
while afterwards and then I started

2271
01:42:16,731 --> 01:42:19,670
reading some things on it that sort of
reinforced these new ideas that I was

2272
01:42:19,671 --> 01:42:23,750
starting to play around with and one of
the things that I was thinking is how

2273
01:42:23,751 --> 01:42:28,490
much of what people do that's fucked up
they're doing out of desperation or out

2274
01:42:28,491 --> 01:42:33,230
of frustration and how much could that
be eliminated and how much would that

2275
01:42:33,231 --> 01:42:37,420
change society and are ambitious people
just.

2276
01:42:37,520 --> 01:42:41,030
I mean you're not talking about anything
where you could fucking go ball and on

2277
01:42:41,330 --> 01:42:43,430
35 grand a year or 12 grand a year,
whatever you,

2278
01:42:43,670 --> 01:42:47,030
whatever you give them 12 grand a year.
Let's say that you're barely going to

2279
01:42:47,031 --> 01:42:49,310
live off that,
but you have enough money for food.

2280
01:42:49,670 --> 01:42:52,280
You have enough money for food.
Hopefully you got enough money for rent.

2281
01:42:52,310 --> 01:42:54,470
If you get some part time jobs here are
there.

2282
01:42:54,471 --> 01:42:59,471
Hopefully you can survive,
but you're less desperate and more

2283
01:42:59,721 --> 01:43:03,350
dependent upon society.
You're more dependent upon the rules of

2284
01:43:03,351 --> 01:43:04,080
society.

2285
01:43:04,080 --> 01:43:05,760
Well,
I mean to see what countries look like

2286
01:43:05,761 --> 01:43:08,790
when that sort of thing happens,
even though it's not a perfect analogy,

2287
01:43:09,120 --> 01:43:12,150
just look at the countries of northern
Europe or even you were talking about

2288
01:43:12,151 --> 01:43:13,070
Melbourne,
you know,

2289
01:43:13,080 --> 01:43:16,560
a country like Australia where it's by
no means perfect.

2290
01:43:16,561 --> 01:43:17,970
There are still poor people,
but gee,

2291
01:43:17,971 --> 01:43:21,810
the levels of poverty are a lot less
than they are here and the number of

2292
01:43:21,811 --> 01:43:25,680
people in grinding abject,
absolute poverty is almost nonexistent

2293
01:43:25,750 --> 01:43:28,380
in comparison to the way that you see it
here in the states because we have

2294
01:43:28,381 --> 01:43:30,330
social,
we have social safety nets that are just

2295
01:43:30,331 --> 01:43:32,820
much more robust,
but you only have 20 million people,

2296
01:43:32,970 --> 01:43:34,950
but even so,
I never buy that argument.

2297
01:43:34,980 --> 01:43:36,600
It everything is scalable.
Joe.

2298
01:43:36,990 --> 01:43:38,160
The fact that we.
Yeah,

2299
01:43:38,161 --> 01:43:41,190
because we only have 20 million people,
but we also have a proportionately fewer

2300
01:43:41,220 --> 01:43:42,870
number of taxpayers.
You have.

2301
01:43:43,170 --> 01:43:45,910
You have tons more people and tons more
taxpayers.

2302
01:43:46,420 --> 01:43:49,300
Like look at Germany.
Germany's a big country that's.

2303
01:43:49,380 --> 01:43:52,130
They've got 80 million people and they
manage to have very,

2304
01:43:52,130 --> 01:43:56,210
very few people basically know people in
abject poverty.

2305
01:43:56,420 --> 01:43:59,570
That might be a bad example because
they're a mess right now.

2306
01:43:59,630 --> 01:44:01,700
Like you know,
Germany is a mess with the immigration

2307
01:44:01,701 --> 01:44:03,110
issue.
That is separate,

2308
01:44:03,111 --> 01:44:04,590
but they're economy is not a mess.
Yeah,

2309
01:44:04,670 --> 01:44:07,850
but they're socially a massive scale.
I mean that's because of Syria.

2310
01:44:08,090 --> 01:44:08,421
Well,
yeah.

2311
01:44:08,421 --> 01:44:10,670
Well there's.
That whole thing is so bizarre where the

2312
01:44:10,671 --> 01:44:14,240
mayor of Munich was telling girls to
keep to themselves and not look at

2313
01:44:14,241 --> 01:44:16,000
anybody and it's crazy.
You know,

2314
01:44:16,010 --> 01:44:21,010
I'm not advocating that America should
invite a 10 million on stream into

2315
01:44:22,400 --> 01:44:25,070
documented Syrians.
Fucking insane.

2316
01:44:25,190 --> 01:44:27,800
But you could certainly.
It could certainly imagine a system in

2317
01:44:27,801 --> 01:44:29,890
which it was a lot easier for people to
wait.

2318
01:44:29,891 --> 01:44:31,990
You did just didn't have entrenched
levels of,

2319
01:44:32,170 --> 01:44:36,500
of grinding poverty.
I just wonder what the cost would be and

2320
01:44:36,501 --> 01:44:39,560
what could.
Is there a mathematical equation that

2321
01:44:39,561 --> 01:44:41,270
can be worked out where that makes
sense.

2322
01:44:42,110 --> 01:44:43,010
I wonder,
you know,

2323
01:44:43,011 --> 01:44:46,630
not doing the math.
Felix Felix will know who's Felix?

2324
01:44:46,800 --> 01:44:48,410
Felix Salmon,
the English guy who does.

2325
01:44:49,340 --> 01:44:51,270
I thought it was like Siri.
I'm like,

2326
01:44:51,410 --> 01:44:54,140
what are you using a windows phone.
You asked Felix.

2327
01:44:54,440 --> 01:44:57,760
It sounds like that sounds like
something wholesale Felix's hasn't

2328
01:44:57,770 --> 01:45:00,040
really posh English accent,
so it sounds like the kind of person who

2329
01:45:00,041 --> 01:45:02,810
you who you would expect to voice one of
those things.

2330
01:45:02,870 --> 01:45:05,780
Do you remember ask Jeeves?
Was everybody used to go to that before

2331
01:45:05,781 --> 01:45:08,180
Google was around?
I know to ask jeeves.

2332
01:45:08,580 --> 01:45:10,550
I mean I didn't have a really useful.
Maybe it was.

2333
01:45:10,640 --> 01:45:15,140
Maybe I'm too young or something.
Was it was you typed in [inaudible] dot

2334
01:45:15,141 --> 01:45:16,670
com?
Don't remember.

2335
01:45:16,671 --> 01:45:18,110
Did you have to phrase things as a
question?

2336
01:45:18,111 --> 01:45:19,140
Sounds stupid now.
I don't know.

2337
01:45:19,520 --> 01:45:21,160
I don't remember.
I know.

2338
01:45:21,290 --> 01:45:24,860
I'm sure I asked jeeves a few things.
I just don't remember what they were.

2339
01:45:25,220 --> 01:45:26,620
Now that I'm thinking about it,
James,

2340
01:45:26,630 --> 01:45:28,530
show me boobs.
I'll james.

2341
01:45:29,450 --> 01:45:31,520
Show me a guy getting raped by a horse.
What's this?

2342
01:45:31,521 --> 01:45:33,100
Ask Dot com now.
Oh,

2343
01:45:33,180 --> 01:45:35,240
just not asked her a question and it
would tell you the answer.

2344
01:45:35,270 --> 01:45:36,830
Where's the tallest waterfall in the.
Okay.

2345
01:45:36,920 --> 01:45:41,920
Ask this.
How much would it cost to give all

2346
01:45:43,011 --> 01:45:46,610
Americans?
I love saying in dollars.

2347
01:45:46,640 --> 01:45:49,550
When you're typing then
okay,

2348
01:45:49,640 --> 01:45:51,980
Bam.
Dot Com is not going to help you with

2349
01:45:51,981 --> 01:45:52,641
us.
Hey,

2350
01:45:52,641 --> 01:45:54,950
you don't look it up.
It would cost 3 trillion to give

2351
01:45:54,951 --> 01:45:59,951
everyone $10,000 a year by that time,
the extra two point five and Jesus

2352
01:46:02,600 --> 01:46:03,433
Christ.
God.

2353
01:46:03,860 --> 01:46:04,760
Damn,
that's great.

2354
01:46:04,761 --> 01:46:05,451
Yeah,
that makes sense.

2355
01:46:05,451 --> 01:46:09,060
Three more than 3 trillion to get to
give him 10 grand a.

2356
01:46:09,380 --> 01:46:10,950
okay,
so gs.

2357
01:46:11,120 --> 01:46:13,820
9 trillion plus to give everybody
authority,

2358
01:46:14,510 --> 01:46:17,960
but you wouldn't give everybody because
everybody who makes over a certain

2359
01:46:17,961 --> 01:46:19,700
amount should have to fucking work it
out.

2360
01:46:19,700 --> 01:46:23,150
But people are so gross.
They would just stay under $250,000.

2361
01:46:23,151 --> 01:46:25,400
I'll make $240.
Not Give Up,

2362
01:46:26,250 --> 01:46:31,250
you know,
because if you let over $1 you would.

2363
01:46:31,611 --> 01:46:33,460
You would have to.
But I think if you were gonna start

2364
01:46:33,470 --> 01:46:35,450
means testing it,
then you didn't have to be a sliding

2365
01:46:35,451 --> 01:46:37,760
scale so that you didn't encounter that
problem.

2366
01:46:37,761 --> 01:46:40,040
Right?
So if you hit it to 50 then you only get

2367
01:46:40,041 --> 01:46:42,680
30.
If you hit two 60 and they get 25,

2368
01:46:42,860 --> 01:46:46,580
but then it becomes complicated and that
that negates a lot of the benefit when

2369
01:46:46,581 --> 01:46:50,100
you're talking about what you really
want is just a wife desperately poor

2370
01:46:50,100 --> 01:46:53,100
people to not be desperately poor.
And there are simpler ways than giving

2371
01:46:53,101 --> 01:46:55,920
everybody a universal basic income.
There are simpler ways,

2372
01:46:56,050 --> 01:47:01,050
but I think the real work,
the real important thing is figuring out

2373
01:47:01,241 --> 01:47:05,680
a way to stop children from growing up
in desperation to stop children from

2374
01:47:05,681 --> 01:47:08,210
growing up in an environment like a.
I,

2375
01:47:08,280 --> 01:47:11,470
this guy on Michael would,
I got to get back to him this week

2376
01:47:11,530 --> 01:47:15,340
because we're working on a new date,
but he was a Baltimore police officer

2377
01:47:15,730 --> 01:47:20,730
and he talked in great detail about real
institutional racism in Baltimore where

2378
01:47:23,600 --> 01:47:24,360
they,
you know,

2379
01:47:24,360 --> 01:47:29,260
they had literally areas where you
couldn't sell black people homes and

2380
01:47:29,261 --> 01:47:31,660
this had been established in the 19
sixties.

2381
01:47:31,930 --> 01:47:35,170
And because of that,
those areas are still fucked.

2382
01:47:35,560 --> 01:47:37,780
Those areas like there,
they're still to this day,

2383
01:47:37,781 --> 01:47:40,360
he found something from the 19
seventies,

2384
01:47:40,690 --> 01:47:41,080
the,
uh,

2385
01:47:41,080 --> 01:47:45,400
the police officers in his district did
where it was like a mandate,

2386
01:47:45,430 --> 01:47:48,760
like what they were supposed to do and
where the crime was and he's like,

2387
01:47:48,940 --> 01:47:53,470
it was exactly the same place is exactly
the same crimes as they were dealing

2388
01:47:53,471 --> 01:47:54,760
with in the 2000.
And he's like,

2389
01:47:55,150 --> 01:48:00,150
how few tile and fucking crazy is this
that you're dealing with this pattern

2390
01:48:00,370 --> 01:48:03,100
that never gets fixed,
never gets corrected.

2391
01:48:03,250 --> 01:48:04,100
And just,
they just,

2392
01:48:04,350 --> 01:48:07,960
cops keep arresting the same people in
the same areas for the same problems.

2393
01:48:07,961 --> 01:48:08,830
And it's like,
Whoa,

2394
01:48:08,860 --> 01:48:10,630
you know,
they've done studies about what the most

2395
01:48:10,631 --> 01:48:12,330
effective way to,
uh,

2396
01:48:12,500 --> 01:48:16,240
to help poor people is because
oftentimes people on the left will be,

2397
01:48:16,270 --> 01:48:20,560
will be in favor of food stamps or like
a bit of public schools and so on.

2398
01:48:20,710 --> 01:48:24,640
All of those things are great,
but a lot of recent research suggests

2399
01:48:24,641 --> 01:48:29,641
that just giving people money is more
effective than trying to figure out all

2400
01:48:29,681 --> 01:48:31,840
of these tweaks because we don't like
giving poor people money because we

2401
01:48:31,841 --> 01:48:32,151
think,
well,

2402
01:48:32,151 --> 01:48:34,060
they're just gonna spend it on drugs or
they gonna spend it on booze or

2403
01:48:34,061 --> 01:48:35,700
something like that with cigarettes,
cigarettes,

2404
01:48:35,710 --> 01:48:38,320
or food up here,
but it turns out,

2405
01:48:38,350 --> 01:48:41,410
and this applies whether you're talking
about desperately poor people in Africa

2406
01:48:41,650 --> 01:48:43,630
or desperately poor people in downtown
Baltimore.

2407
01:48:43,840 --> 01:48:48,400
If you give them money,
most people use it for good ends.

2408
01:48:48,430 --> 01:48:51,190
The the,
the thing they really want the most is

2409
01:48:51,191 --> 01:48:56,191
to eat and be able to pay their bills
and to get out of the situation they're

2410
01:48:56,351 --> 01:48:57,970
in.
A minority of people will spend,

2411
01:48:57,971 --> 01:49:01,900
will blow it on booze and cigarettes,
but they are a small minority.

2412
01:49:02,290 --> 01:49:04,120
Yeah,
I know what their needs are more better

2413
01:49:04,121 --> 01:49:07,210
than we know what their needs are.
There's this paternalistic idea that we

2414
01:49:07,211 --> 01:49:08,830
always have,
like we have to figure out how to get

2415
01:49:08,831 --> 01:49:11,020
people out of poverty.
People know how to get themselves out of

2416
01:49:11,021 --> 01:49:12,870
poverty if they just had the resources
to do so,

2417
01:49:13,070 --> 01:49:14,020
so just give them a bit of money.

2418
01:49:14,120 --> 01:49:17,900
Yeah.
It's also this absolute realization that

2419
01:49:17,901 --> 01:49:21,650
this is not a level playing field and
that someone corn in the slums of

2420
01:49:21,680 --> 01:49:24,500
Inglewood is not the same as someone who
was born in

2421
01:49:24,890 --> 01:49:28,700
so crazy about libertarians when they,
when they go on about how everyone

2422
01:49:28,701 --> 01:49:29,770
should be free.
Yeah,

2423
01:49:29,990 --> 01:49:31,250
of course.
Everyone should be free.

2424
01:49:31,251 --> 01:49:36,251
I am as libertarian as you can get,
but within within the understanding that

2425
01:49:37,460 --> 01:49:40,910
it's crazy to say that people are
equally for the person in beverly who's

2426
01:49:40,911 --> 01:49:43,250
born in Beverly hills to a white middle
class.

2427
01:49:43,251 --> 01:49:48,251
Upper class family is only as free as
the baby born in the slums of Baltimore.

2428
01:49:49,751 --> 01:49:51,940
This is crazy.
Of course you should use the,

2429
01:49:51,970 --> 01:49:52,691
the,
I think,

2430
01:49:52,691 --> 01:49:55,750
the power of the state to be able to
level the playing field a little bit.

2431
01:49:55,930 --> 01:49:58,420
Just to skim a little bit off the
Beverly Hills family and give a little

2432
01:49:58,421 --> 01:50:01,540
bit to the Baltimore family.
I don't see what's so tyrannical about

2433
01:50:01,541 --> 01:50:02,520
that.
Well yeah,

2434
01:50:02,640 --> 01:50:05,060
because you're not coming from an even
start point,

2435
01:50:05,090 --> 01:50:05,841
right?
So,

2436
01:50:05,841 --> 01:50:10,841
and then there's also this notion that
as a country we were only as strong as

2437
01:50:12,591 --> 01:50:13,790
the weakest link.
Right?

2438
01:50:13,970 --> 01:50:18,970
So if we created a system where we had
less people in desperation,

2439
01:50:19,430 --> 01:50:21,830
less people in despair,
less less losers,

2440
01:50:22,340 --> 01:50:25,580
we would be more winners will get our
shit together,

2441
01:50:25,581 --> 01:50:27,110
we would,
we would produce more,

2442
01:50:27,230 --> 01:50:29,090
we'd be more effective.
I wonder.

2443
01:50:29,091 --> 01:50:33,470
I just wonder what the actual numbers
are because like how much money is being

2444
01:50:33,471 --> 01:50:35,630
spent every year on things that we don't
need,

2445
01:50:35,631 --> 01:50:39,200
how much,
how much money from our taxes goes to

2446
01:50:39,530 --> 01:50:43,970
bureaucracy and bullshit and it's really
distorted representative government that

2447
01:50:43,971 --> 01:50:46,070
most people don't agree with.
How much of that,

2448
01:50:46,071 --> 01:50:49,880
how much of it is just fucking cronyism
and handing money back and forth?

2449
01:50:49,930 --> 01:50:50,770
Well,
each other,

2450
01:50:50,830 --> 01:50:52,330
I'll tell you what,
we don't spend a lot of money and we

2451
01:50:52,331 --> 01:50:56,910
don't spend a lot of money on
bureaucracy and waste in your like

2452
01:50:57,310 --> 01:50:59,260
people.
People who want to cut government

2453
01:50:59,261 --> 01:51:00,920
spending will often say like,
you know,

2454
01:51:00,950 --> 01:51:02,620
first thing I'm going to do when I get
into,

2455
01:51:02,621 --> 01:51:05,560
when I get to Congress,
as I'm going to repaint,

2456
01:51:05,610 --> 01:51:07,450
you know,
my congressional office or something,

2457
01:51:07,451 --> 01:51:08,201
or I'm gonna,
you know,

2458
01:51:08,201 --> 01:51:09,034
I'm gonna,
I'm gonna.

2459
01:51:09,050 --> 01:51:12,400
Throw out the fancy stuff and I'm going
to get an old couch like these.

2460
01:51:12,430 --> 01:51:14,440
This is not what we're spending our
money on.

2461
01:51:14,980 --> 01:51:19,540
What we're spending our money on is the
military and Medicare and social

2462
01:51:19,541 --> 01:51:24,541
security basically.
So right in healthcare costs and stopped

2463
01:51:25,520 --> 01:51:27,730
and cut the military and you would.
And that's where the big,

2464
01:51:27,890 --> 01:51:29,500
the big,
the military.

2465
01:51:29,501 --> 01:51:30,580
But then what happened,
son,

2466
01:51:30,730 --> 01:51:31,360
let me tell you something.

2467
01:51:31,360 --> 01:51:33,550
Freedom Ain't free.
They're going to come over here and take

2468
01:51:33,551 --> 01:51:35,980
our jobs and kick our women into the
curb or something.

2469
01:51:36,040 --> 01:51:37,900
I've been,
I've been having a twitter argument with

2470
01:51:37,901 --> 01:51:39,520
a person who's been saying that,
uh,

2471
01:51:39,570 --> 01:51:42,160
that the reason why America's roads are
so bad.

2472
01:51:42,161 --> 01:51:43,780
It's because we spend too much on
foreign aid.

2473
01:51:43,960 --> 01:51:44,980
That's may do.
I'm sorry.

2474
01:51:46,310 --> 01:51:48,010
Fuck.
When am I?

2475
01:51:48,011 --> 01:51:52,750
Just say it because I know Britain,
Britain spends three or four times more

2476
01:51:52,751 --> 01:51:55,810
per capita on foreign aid.
Sweden spend six times more per capita

2477
01:51:55,811 --> 01:51:57,730
if you've seen the road in Sweden.
It really quite nice.

2478
01:51:58,820 --> 01:52:00,190
Yeah.
We have more roads,

2479
01:52:00,191 --> 01:52:01,160
don't we?
Of course,

2480
01:52:01,240 --> 01:52:03,040
but again,
you also have been more mindful.

2481
01:52:03,041 --> 01:52:04,540
You have more tax payers to pay for
them.

2482
01:52:04,630 --> 01:52:07,090
Just looking at overall numbers.
We spend more money because we have more

2483
01:52:07,091 --> 01:52:08,140
roads.
Yeah,

2484
01:52:08,141 --> 01:52:10,060
and you spend more money on foreign aid
as well,

2485
01:52:10,061 --> 01:52:11,290
but there were more likely to share it.

2486
01:52:11,380 --> 01:52:13,480
I'm a petroleum trader.
I'm going to get.

2487
01:52:13,490 --> 01:52:16,050
I'm going to be an egg with the opinion.
Here's something.

2488
01:52:16,060 --> 01:52:17,400
Here's something.
Here's a players,

2489
01:52:17,401 --> 01:52:20,500
a reform which you could support,
which would really help you figure out

2490
01:52:20,501 --> 01:52:21,880
where you.
Where the money goes.

2491
01:52:22,510 --> 01:52:25,060
When you get your tax bill at the end of
the year,

2492
01:52:25,120 --> 01:52:29,350
your tax statement from the irs,
they could as they do in Australia and a

2493
01:52:29,351 --> 01:52:32,110
bunch of other countries have a little
bar graph,

2494
01:52:32,260 --> 01:52:36,190
a colorful little graph with lines
showing how much you've spent on

2495
01:52:36,191 --> 01:52:37,660
everything.
So in Australia,

2496
01:52:37,950 --> 01:52:40,750
if you,
if you paid $18,000 in tax that year,

2497
01:52:41,170 --> 01:52:43,630
then there's a little bit,
a little purple line on the graph which

2498
01:52:43,631 --> 01:52:44,200
says,
you know,

2499
01:52:44,200 --> 01:52:47,810
you spent four,
$782 and sixteen cents on Medicare,

2500
01:52:48,130 --> 01:52:51,170
spent this much on security,
spend this much on foreign aid and then

2501
01:52:51,171 --> 01:52:52,910
you can actually see it there.
That's great.

2502
01:52:52,940 --> 01:52:56,930
There's a proposal in front of Congress
which some Democrats are pushing to

2503
01:52:56,931 --> 01:52:57,950
bring this in here.

2504
01:52:58,250 --> 01:53:01,850
And also to streamline the way that you
do your taxes because in a lot of other

2505
01:53:01,851 --> 01:53:03,200
countries,
apart from the states,

2506
01:53:03,620 --> 01:53:06,170
you don't have to go through the
rigmarole of filling out all of your

2507
01:53:06,171 --> 01:53:07,250
taxes,
the government.

2508
01:53:07,640 --> 01:53:10,400
Because when,
when you do a job and you get a,

2509
01:53:10,460 --> 01:53:15,050
you have to supply the irs with a 10,
99 or a w two at the end of the year.

2510
01:53:15,650 --> 01:53:17,450
Remember that the person who gave you
the 10,

2511
01:53:17,451 --> 01:53:21,080
99 or the w two also sent a copy to the
irs.

2512
01:53:21,530 --> 01:53:24,800
The irs already has it.
They could just fill it out themselves.

2513
01:53:25,040 --> 01:53:28,370
Instead.
They make you do it and it's difficult

2514
01:53:28,371 --> 01:53:30,710
and cumbersome.
But in a lot of other countries like the

2515
01:53:30,711 --> 01:53:33,410
UK and Australia,
they have the option of just signing off

2516
01:53:33,411 --> 01:53:34,161
on it and saying,
yeah,

2517
01:53:34,161 --> 01:53:34,994
okay,
this looks good.

2518
01:53:35,130 --> 01:53:39,740
You can just do my taxes for me and the
and the proposals to make to simplify

2519
01:53:39,741 --> 01:53:42,620
doing your taxes are being pushed by
Democrats.

2520
01:53:42,740 --> 01:53:47,460
And I find it wildly ironic that the
people who oppose these policies are

2521
01:53:47,510 --> 01:53:51,590
Republicans and Grover Norquist,
the anti tax crusader who you would

2522
01:53:51,591 --> 01:53:55,340
think would want to make it easier,
but it's in their interest to make taxes

2523
01:53:55,550 --> 01:54:00,550
as difficult to do and as difficult to
understand as possible because they want

2524
01:54:00,651 --> 01:54:02,780
you to continue hating taxes as much as
possible.

2525
01:54:02,960 --> 01:54:03,890
Also,
the republic,

2526
01:54:03,920 --> 01:54:07,420
the military industrial complex that the
Republicans essentially work for.

2527
01:54:07,430 --> 01:54:11,180
Don't want you to know how much we spend
on the Pentagon so that they oppose this

2528
01:54:11,181 --> 01:54:14,060
bar graph idea because they know that
the biggest line item would be this

2529
01:54:14,061 --> 01:54:17,540
massive thing and you'd be like,
do we really need to be spending that

2530
01:54:17,541 --> 01:54:20,840
much on the military?
Or is this really a jobs program where

2531
01:54:20,841 --> 01:54:24,620
we're building nuclear submarines that
depending on doesn't want important

2532
01:54:24,621 --> 01:54:26,780
districts in Delaware,
Delaware,

2533
01:54:27,050 --> 01:54:29,020
just so that the,
the we,

2534
01:54:29,050 --> 01:54:30,260
we can keep some,
some jobs.

2535
01:54:30,261 --> 01:54:32,330
They're in a factory that's producing
munitions that it doesn't,

2536
01:54:32,360 --> 01:54:33,320
does it no longer needs to be?

2537
01:54:33,670 --> 01:54:35,440
Well,
I think one of the good things about

2538
01:54:35,441 --> 01:54:38,860
someone proposing something like that as
you get to look at who's opposing it and

2539
01:54:38,861 --> 01:54:41,320
when someone's proposing something that
make sense and it makes it,

2540
01:54:41,321 --> 01:54:45,640
unless there's some sort of exorbitant
fee that's involved in giving people a

2541
01:54:45,641 --> 01:54:47,680
detailed rundown of where their money
goes,

2542
01:54:47,950 --> 01:54:48,820
then you would say,
well,

2543
01:54:48,821 --> 01:54:52,660
someone's against transparency and if
you're against transparency or against

2544
01:54:52,661 --> 01:54:54,640
freedom,
you fuck your against America.

2545
01:54:54,960 --> 01:54:56,640
Play the music,
Jimmy Man,

2546
01:54:56,650 --> 01:54:58,810
the free home of the brave.
Goddammit.

2547
01:54:58,900 --> 01:55:00,640
I want to know where my fucking taxes
go.

2548
01:55:01,660 --> 01:55:03,040
Yes.
If you're anti tax,

2549
01:55:03,041 --> 01:55:04,960
then you should be pro transparency and
text.

2550
01:55:04,961 --> 01:55:07,690
We found out my taxes.
I went to welfare cigarettes.

2551
01:55:09,360 --> 01:55:13,860
That's where they didn't go booze on
pills for the kids.

2552
01:55:14,250 --> 01:55:15,150
Yeah.
Yeah.

2553
01:55:15,170 --> 01:55:18,660
Imagine we should spend more on.
I just wonder what the number would be

2554
01:55:18,990 --> 01:55:20,090
like,
what to do,

2555
01:55:20,100 --> 01:55:21,720
the universal basic income.
Yeah.

2556
01:55:21,721 --> 01:55:24,520
I wonder what would the number would be
and what would be.

2557
01:55:24,610 --> 01:55:28,110
Just try to keep it up.
I'll tell you if I got a rant coming on.

2558
01:55:28,730 --> 01:55:30,690
I'll tell you if I got a rant coming on
me right now.

2559
01:55:30,691 --> 01:55:34,020
I'm not feeling that America even better
when I do an Australian accent and you

2560
01:55:34,021 --> 01:55:36,240
play the US national anthem and it
sounds really weird.

2561
01:55:36,480 --> 01:55:39,690
Cognitive dissonance.
I

2562
01:55:40,030 --> 01:55:41,610
play at Jamie.
Play the anthem.

2563
01:55:41,620 --> 01:55:44,130
Liliana,
let's just get a little of a bit of

2564
01:55:44,131 --> 01:55:46,890
patriotism going here.
Mate.

2565
01:55:47,180 --> 01:55:48,900
I want to tell you a thing or two about
this,

2566
01:55:48,930 --> 01:55:51,080
about the United States,
but talking to you.

2567
01:55:51,320 --> 01:55:52,950
I don't know.
Overdo it.

2568
01:55:53,600 --> 01:55:54,680
Can't fake it.
All right.

2569
01:55:54,840 --> 01:55:58,050
Okay.
What is country?

2570
01:55:58,860 --> 01:56:02,940
A Nation of brave,
courageous men and women who fought for

2571
01:56:02,941 --> 01:56:04,320
years now.
Centuries.

2572
01:56:04,410 --> 01:56:04,951
Okay.
Hold on.

2573
01:56:04,951 --> 01:56:07,320
Stop.
What about non binary sexual people,

2574
01:56:08,280 --> 01:56:11,440
men or women?
You being transphobic?

2575
01:56:11,760 --> 01:56:12,990
Yes.
You're very transphobic.

2576
01:56:13,320 --> 01:56:16,380
Sit on my podcast the other day that
people who vote for Hillary because they

2577
01:56:16,381 --> 01:56:19,080
voted because they.
Because she's a woman only voting for

2578
01:56:19,081 --> 01:56:21,870
her because she's got a vagina.
Someone on twitter said that that was

2579
01:56:21,871 --> 01:56:23,910
transferred it because there are women
who don't have vaginas.

2580
01:56:24,510 --> 01:56:25,350
Yeah,
I disagree.

2581
01:56:26,450 --> 01:56:28,460
Yeah.
There's an x and a y chromosome.

2582
01:56:28,461 --> 01:56:31,220
There's a lot of genetics you might
identify with being a woman.

2583
01:56:31,230 --> 01:56:33,440
If you've got a dick though,
we have a real problem.

2584
01:56:33,441 --> 01:56:35,480
I'm happy to call them limit if they
want to be called women.

2585
01:56:35,481 --> 01:56:37,060
I really don't have a problem with it,
but don't cut.

2586
01:56:37,130 --> 01:56:39,560
Don't call me.
It's not transphobic for me to make a

2587
01:56:39,561 --> 01:56:41,840
generalization that most women have
vaginas.

2588
01:56:41,930 --> 01:56:44,630
Um,
I saw an opening to call you transphobic

2589
01:56:44,631 --> 01:56:47,860
and I jumped on it because it's there.
So I sank your battleship.

2590
01:56:47,930 --> 01:56:52,930
I got 12.
I saw it as they're playing games.

2591
01:56:53,091 --> 01:56:54,680
You don't have to have a vagina to be a
woman.

2592
01:56:54,770 --> 01:56:55,750
Yeah.
You.

2593
01:56:56,210 --> 01:56:58,850
How about fuck you?
Jesus Christ.

2594
01:56:59,300 --> 01:57:00,800
What do you think about this North
Carolina law though?

2595
01:57:00,801 --> 01:57:03,470
About this?
Is Mrs the bathroom.

2596
01:57:03,750 --> 01:57:06,260
I'm so conflicted about this because I
also,

2597
01:57:06,400 --> 01:57:08,700
I also got into trouble on my podcast
was talking about this.

2598
01:57:08,730 --> 01:57:13,730
So I think it's obviously a silly beat
up and I think that trans people have

2599
01:57:13,801 --> 01:57:17,870
been and will continue to use bathrooms,
uh,

2600
01:57:17,970 --> 01:57:20,640
and we shouldn't worry about it and I
don't think that people should be

2601
01:57:20,641 --> 01:57:25,641
passing laws against it,
but I also think it's disingenuous of

2602
01:57:26,610 --> 01:57:29,340
Pro Trans people and I regard myself as
broadly pro trans,

2603
01:57:29,341 --> 01:57:31,020
just in the same sense that I'm broadly
pro,

2604
01:57:31,021 --> 01:57:32,190
hey,
whatever floats your boat,

2605
01:57:32,191 --> 01:57:33,510
just live the life that you want to
live.

2606
01:57:33,540 --> 01:57:35,050
Whoever you as do our.
Um,

2607
01:57:35,580 --> 01:57:39,090
I do think it's disingenuous when they
start saying that people who have the

2608
01:57:39,091 --> 01:57:44,091
outward appearance of the gender on
their birth certificate should be able

2609
01:57:45,781 --> 01:57:50,781
to use the opposite a restroom and that
nobody should have a problem with that

2610
01:57:52,200 --> 01:57:54,360
because they declare themselves to be
trans.

2611
01:57:54,390 --> 01:57:56,760
So I'm talking,
for example about there was,

2612
01:57:56,761 --> 01:58:00,480
I saw a facebook argument about this
where a friend of a friend of mine on

2613
01:58:00,481 --> 01:58:05,481
facebook is a trans woman who was
assigned male at birth and has no

2614
01:58:05,941 --> 01:58:09,240
intention of transitioning at all.
Right?

2615
01:58:09,241 --> 01:58:12,810
So she has a beach,
she's a fat guy with a beard who plays

2616
01:58:12,811 --> 01:58:15,420
guitar.
And that's what all of her photos are

2617
01:58:15,720 --> 01:58:18,810
and she doesn't want to have her dick
cut off and she doesn't want to grow

2618
01:58:18,811 --> 01:58:23,811
breasts and she doesn't want to lose her
beard and she's arguing that it's

2619
01:58:24,050 --> 01:58:27,930
transphobic to say that she shouldn't be
able to use the women's restroom.

2620
01:58:29,130 --> 01:58:33,210
And other people were saying,
you can understand how like a parent

2621
01:58:33,211 --> 01:58:37,050
might be concerned if their daughter
went into the girls' restroom and then

2622
01:58:37,051 --> 01:58:40,890
what appears to be a large be added fat
man walks in after her,

2623
01:58:41,730 --> 01:58:42,160
you know,

2624
01:58:42,160 --> 01:58:46,450
that is not necessarily transphobic.
And then all of a sudden she's like,

2625
01:58:46,600 --> 01:58:49,030
how dare you say that?
There has not been a single instance of

2626
01:58:49,031 --> 01:58:52,700
a trans person abusing this is just like
the gay fear back in the 1970.

2627
01:58:52,701 --> 01:58:56,140
If you're claiming that trans people are
more likely to be pedophiles and blah,

2628
01:58:56,141 --> 01:58:56,880
blah,
blah.

2629
01:58:56,880 --> 01:58:58,030
No,
no,

2630
01:59:00,640 --> 01:59:02,440
no.
We're not saying that.

2631
01:59:02,470 --> 01:59:04,720
We're just saying,
how do you expect us to know the

2632
01:59:04,721 --> 01:59:09,580
difference between you a trans woman who
looks like a man and a man when you're

2633
01:59:09,581 --> 01:59:11,140
being reasonable?
And that's the problem.

2634
01:59:11,141 --> 01:59:12,930
This is not a reasonable discussion.
Now,

2635
01:59:12,970 --> 01:59:16,090
here's what's really ironic,
what we really should be concerned with

2636
01:59:16,091 --> 01:59:21,091
is not the trans people we should really
be concerned with is heterosexual people

2637
01:59:21,251 --> 01:59:24,910
pretending to be transpeople
heterosexual people who are in fact

2638
01:59:24,911 --> 01:59:28,270
sexual predators,
who all they have to do to have to

2639
01:59:28,271 --> 01:59:29,110
pretend to be trans.

2640
01:59:29,110 --> 01:59:30,280
I mean they would do.
Oh,

2641
01:59:30,281 --> 01:59:32,680
I see what you mean.
Like all they will have to do is to wear

2642
01:59:32,681 --> 01:59:36,400
a dress and go to the woman's room and
say they're trans and they could do

2643
01:59:36,401 --> 01:59:39,790
whatever the fuck they want once they're
in there and that's the real issue is

2644
01:59:39,791 --> 01:59:43,630
not the actual trans people.
That's rice people that are using this

2645
01:59:43,870 --> 01:59:47,530
very ambiguous law there.
I mean this is a very ambiguous

2646
01:59:47,531 --> 01:59:49,510
distinction.
If someone identifies with the opposite

2647
01:59:49,511 --> 01:59:53,200
sex without having any outward
appearance of being that opposite sex,

2648
01:59:53,440 --> 01:59:57,790
all guy would have to do is say I'm
trans and you can go into a female

2649
01:59:57,791 --> 02:00:00,280
restroom.
I think the likely it's not going to

2650
02:00:00,281 --> 02:00:01,030
happen.
Yeah.

2651
02:00:01,030 --> 02:00:04,630
I don't recognize it's exactly.
It's a possibility,

2652
02:00:04,960 --> 02:00:07,030
but again,
it comes back to the conversation about

2653
02:00:07,031 --> 02:00:10,240
rape or about Islam or about what about
like black lives matter or whatever.

2654
02:00:10,450 --> 02:00:13,270
This is a new what we're trying to have
a nuanced conversation and it's

2655
02:00:13,271 --> 02:00:17,770
impossible to have because all you're
allowed to be is either pro trans or

2656
02:00:17,771 --> 02:00:19,720
you're a religious evangelical bigot,
right?

2657
02:00:19,770 --> 02:00:20,603
Yes.
You're not allowed.

2658
02:00:20,620 --> 02:00:21,790
There's no.
There's no middle ground.

2659
02:00:21,791 --> 02:00:25,240
We just have to hunker down joe into a
little trenches just and have a war of

2660
02:00:25,241 --> 02:00:26,920
attrition.
When I'm on one side and you're on the

2661
02:00:26,921 --> 02:00:29,010
other side and the last man fucking
stands,

2662
02:00:29,011 --> 02:00:29,520
it's like,
whoa,

2663
02:00:29,520 --> 02:00:29,951
Whoa,
one.

2664
02:00:29,951 --> 02:00:33,400
We don't passion dial all over again.
Just firing at each other on twitter.

2665
02:00:33,480 --> 02:00:35,950
You're not allowed to have a nuanced
perspective.

2666
02:00:35,980 --> 02:00:39,010
Don't you think this is a direct result
of the Bush administration like we were

2667
02:00:39,011 --> 02:00:40,870
talking about?
I really do think that that's what it

2668
02:00:40,871 --> 02:00:43,330
is.
I think everybody was so scared and

2669
02:00:43,331 --> 02:00:48,190
conservativism was at at such a high
point that the rebound from that,

2670
02:00:48,400 --> 02:00:51,850
the rebound from all the anti gay
hysterica.

2671
02:00:51,960 --> 02:00:54,610
I mean that administration was right
with homophobia,

2672
02:00:54,611 --> 02:00:57,640
ripe with all sorts of different types
of discrimination.

2673
02:00:57,641 --> 02:01:02,140
It was a fucking weird,
weird time dissolves the lift too much

2674
02:01:02,141 --> 02:01:06,410
and I think it also fails to recognize
the changes that social media has

2675
02:01:06,411 --> 02:01:08,140
brought.
I don't think this would be as bad

2676
02:01:08,450 --> 02:01:09,290
altogether.
Yeah.

2677
02:01:09,380 --> 02:01:10,780
Twenty four hour media.
Yes.

2678
02:01:10,810 --> 02:01:15,340
Social media.
Like Stephen Fry quit in February.

2679
02:01:15,370 --> 02:01:17,410
He was one of the first adopters and he
was like,

2680
02:01:17,411 --> 02:01:21,280
it used to be this like this,
this lake in the forest where you could

2681
02:01:21,281 --> 02:01:25,030
run and jump and play and now it's a
fitted swamp with everyone pissing in

2682
02:01:25,031 --> 02:01:26,530
the pool.
I'm a Stephen Fry fan,

2683
02:01:26,531 --> 02:01:28,300
but I got to say,
I think he went out like a bitch.

2684
02:01:29,770 --> 02:01:31,490
He should have hung in there.
Fuck yeah.

2685
02:01:31,580 --> 02:01:33,880
Come on.
That's small group of people can chase

2686
02:01:33,881 --> 02:01:38,290
you out of one of the most fucking
easily used forms of free expression the

2687
02:01:38,291 --> 02:01:40,210
world has ever known,
but he takes.

2688
02:01:40,210 --> 02:01:42,610
Is him making a joke about a dress?
Yeah.

2689
02:01:42,650 --> 02:01:44,390
And people shitting on him for making a
joke,

2690
02:01:44,420 --> 02:01:45,110
but what?
What,

2691
02:01:45,110 --> 02:01:47,840
what?
Why would you even care about the

2692
02:01:47,841 --> 02:01:51,770
opinion of people who get upset at you
for making fun of address in his blog

2693
02:01:51,771 --> 02:01:53,210
where he was talking about quitting
twitter,

2694
02:01:53,211 --> 02:01:55,790
he did begin by saying,
this is not a big deal.

2695
02:01:55,791 --> 02:01:58,370
I don't know if this is forever.
I'm not doing this as a stand.

2696
02:01:58,760 --> 02:02:02,390
I just feel so much more liberated.
Not going there because you're right.

2697
02:02:02,480 --> 02:02:05,880
He is at the pinnacle of his industry.
He was hosting the bloody baptist.

2698
02:02:05,881 --> 02:02:08,480
I mean that's like posting the Academy
Awards in the UK,

2699
02:02:08,840 --> 02:02:12,020
so he should be big enough to have
people sniping at him.

2700
02:02:12,050 --> 02:02:15,350
If you're hosting the Academy Awards.
He's a sniper.

2701
02:02:15,640 --> 02:02:18,340
Yeah.
That's what does this whole thing is.

2702
02:02:18,360 --> 02:02:20,960
I can understand.
His whole thing is marketing.

2703
02:02:20,961 --> 02:02:25,700
People say they're offended,
so he's getting offended by people

2704
02:02:25,701 --> 02:02:27,680
mocking him for being offended.

2705
02:02:27,770 --> 02:02:30,230
I'm not sure he's offended.
I think he just doesn't want to play

2706
02:02:30,231 --> 02:02:30,831
that game.
Okay.

2707
02:02:30,831 --> 02:02:32,150
What does that word then?
What?

2708
02:02:32,151 --> 02:02:37,151
Where do we looking for upset board?
No upset board and exhausted.

2709
02:02:37,490 --> 02:02:39,740
I don't believe you write a whole blog
because you're bored.

2710
02:02:39,950 --> 02:02:41,750
I think you're right.
A blog because you're upset.

2711
02:02:41,751 --> 02:02:44,480
He was angry,
he was visibly angry or at least

2712
02:02:44,990 --> 02:02:48,740
appeared to be through his tweets and
his reactions to people being upset with

2713
02:02:48,741 --> 02:02:50,660
him.
I'm making fun of that dress.

2714
02:02:51,180 --> 02:02:53,900
I mean,
I just think it's hard sometimes.

2715
02:02:54,780 --> 02:02:57,950
Who knows what was going on in his life
when that was going on.

2716
02:02:57,960 --> 02:03:00,890
He made that decision as well.
It could have been like a down point in

2717
02:03:00,891 --> 02:03:02,250
him in his life.
Emotionally.

2718
02:03:02,251 --> 02:03:04,880
You might have realized that might be an
up point because I think he just got

2719
02:03:04,881 --> 02:03:05,960
married.
He's getting married.

2720
02:03:05,961 --> 02:03:06,351
He's,
you know,

2721
02:03:06,351 --> 02:03:09,410
he's dating this guy who's like 50 years
younger than him or something,

2722
02:03:09,411 --> 02:03:12,250
so I was getting a lot of us and he's
probably,

2723
02:03:12,860 --> 02:03:14,080
he's probably having a great time.

2724
02:03:14,080 --> 02:03:15,470
He's like,
I don't need this shit anymore.

2725
02:03:15,471 --> 02:03:17,990
They can don't fuck off.
I don't have time for 140 characters

2726
02:03:18,070 --> 02:03:19,110
pitch.
Exactly.

2727
02:03:19,160 --> 02:03:20,810
But then why does he have time to write
about it?

2728
02:03:20,811 --> 02:03:22,700
Then I have to step away.
Why?

2729
02:03:22,730 --> 02:03:24,530
Why?
It's like when someone would notice it

2730
02:03:24,531 --> 02:03:25,341
and then they'd be like,
oh,

2731
02:03:25,341 --> 02:03:27,350
well we're Stephen Fry.
Why isn't he responding to things?

2732
02:03:27,351 --> 02:03:28,190
It's easy.
You just say,

2733
02:03:28,191 --> 02:03:29,024
Hey,
here I am,

2734
02:03:29,240 --> 02:03:30,570
I'm going.
I wouldn't be here for awhile,

2735
02:03:31,020 --> 02:03:31,851
but what?
Why,

2736
02:03:31,851 --> 02:03:33,250
why?
Even if you can't,

2737
02:03:33,290 --> 02:03:34,730
if you don't care,
you're gonna leave.

2738
02:03:34,731 --> 02:03:37,340
Why even make an announcement?
It's like if someone said to you,

2739
02:03:37,640 --> 02:03:38,473
you know,
hey man,

2740
02:03:38,540 --> 02:03:41,870
I just thought that your jokes you made
about rape and the Joe Rogan podcast.

2741
02:03:41,871 --> 02:03:44,390
We're totally uncalled for,
followed,

2742
02:03:46,360 --> 02:03:51,360
followed through the unfollowed dance.
See what I wrote,

2743
02:03:53,050 --> 02:03:56,730
but I'm pretty sure I read it.
I wish the audio podcast listeners could

2744
02:03:56,731 --> 02:04:00,990
see the Joe Rogan dance that just
happened of like halfway between a down

2745
02:04:00,991 --> 02:04:05,991
syndrome child and then
I unfollowed you.

2746
02:04:06,420 --> 02:04:07,253
I win in

2747
02:04:07,490 --> 02:04:10,380
a day.
This is the national anthem.

2748
02:04:10,390 --> 02:04:13,500
It's that thing that they do.
They just want to get your what,

2749
02:04:13,620 --> 02:04:17,700
how many people are talking about?
I mean one or two or three people got

2750
02:04:17,701 --> 02:04:18,560
mad at him.
No,

2751
02:04:18,570 --> 02:04:18,811
no,
no.

2752
02:04:18,811 --> 02:04:19,260
I mean,
I,

2753
02:04:19,260 --> 02:04:20,160
I take your point.
Sure.

2754
02:04:20,190 --> 02:04:21,840
Maybe it's a pussy move,
but it's his life.

2755
02:04:21,870 --> 02:04:23,640
He doesn't have to be on twitter if you
don't want to be on twitter.

2756
02:04:23,680 --> 02:04:27,770
The problem is he's so great.
Upsets me that he would have that.

2757
02:04:27,860 --> 02:04:30,390
That reaction too,
by the way.

2758
02:04:30,720 --> 02:04:32,580
I've read the things that people wrote
to him.

2759
02:04:32,581 --> 02:04:36,120
It wasn't really that big of a deal.
He made fun of a woman's dress and said

2760
02:04:36,121 --> 02:04:37,100
it looked like a garbage bag.

2761
02:04:38,150 --> 02:04:40,710
One of his friends.
It's kind of funny,

2762
02:04:41,040 --> 02:04:42,900
but of course people are gonna.
React.

2763
02:04:43,110 --> 02:04:43,890
Here's what.
Here's what.

2764
02:04:43,890 --> 02:04:45,720
Here's what.
Here's what he wrote.

2765
02:04:45,721 --> 02:04:47,970
He said,
let us grieve what twitter has become a

2766
02:04:47,971 --> 02:04:52,090
stalking ground for the sanctimoniously
self righteous who loved to second guess

2767
02:04:52,091 --> 02:04:56,400
to leap to conclusions and be offended.
Worse to be offended on behalf of others

2768
02:04:56,401 --> 02:04:58,620
they don't even know.
And then he says,

2769
02:04:58,621 --> 02:05:00,270
it doesn't matter whether are defending
women,

2770
02:05:00,271 --> 02:05:01,470
men,
transgender people,

2771
02:05:01,471 --> 02:05:02,460
Muslims,
humanists.

2772
02:05:02,520 --> 02:05:05,520
The ghastliness is absolutely the same.
Okay.

2773
02:05:05,521 --> 02:05:08,880
What's a pram?
The stroller.

2774
02:05:09,050 --> 02:05:11,580
Oh,
out of a pram as I go.

2775
02:05:12,170 --> 02:05:13,590
Well,
I thought it was like a boat,

2776
02:05:14,070 --> 02:05:15,450
a pram.
That's my.

2777
02:05:15,480 --> 02:05:17,230
That's what way in the British Cola
Cola.

2778
02:05:17,900 --> 02:05:19,620
Jamie,
Google the word Pram.

2779
02:05:19,621 --> 02:05:23,900
Why don't I think the pram was a type of
boat and a pram,

2780
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:25,110
Pram.
You got a bunch of,

2781
02:05:25,111 --> 02:05:27,930
uh,
what the fuck it had a reset your

2782
02:05:27,931 --> 02:05:28,764
computer.

2783
02:05:29,090 --> 02:05:31,980
It's a stroller.
I just told you that three times.

2784
02:05:31,990 --> 02:05:33,090
John,
trust me.

2785
02:05:33,240 --> 02:05:37,470
How do you not trust me?
But I wanted him to google boat boat

2786
02:05:38,070 --> 02:05:39,120
because why do I think?
Oh yeah.

2787
02:05:39,121 --> 02:05:40,100
It says boat.
That's one of the.

2788
02:05:40,101 --> 02:05:40,934
Yeah,
it was a boat.

2789
02:05:41,840 --> 02:05:42,780
It's type of boat.
Is it a,

2790
02:05:42,781 --> 02:05:44,980
is it a,
a sort of brand of both

2791
02:05:46,560 --> 02:05:50,040
small utility,
Dinky transom bow rather than a pointed

2792
02:05:50,041 --> 02:05:51,450
bow?
Don't make fun of me Bro.

2793
02:05:51,451 --> 02:05:54,240
I got knowledge.
Deep knowledge about shitty boats,

2794
02:05:56,640 --> 02:06:00,510
small utility biggies.
That's what I knew was like why is he

2795
02:06:00,511 --> 02:06:02,550
throwing this idea that of a small
utility data,

2796
02:06:05,090 --> 02:06:06,940
but what he said was eloquent.
I mean he's,

2797
02:06:07,080 --> 02:06:12,080
he's dead on about the sanctimonious
recreational outrage and also he lives

2798
02:06:12,301 --> 02:06:14,340
in a country.
Remember where you can actually be,

2799
02:06:14,550 --> 02:06:18,960
be prosecuted for saying things that
people find offensive like in the UK.

2800
02:06:18,960 --> 02:06:21,790
Did you,
did you hear about the mealy mouth a

2801
02:06:21,870 --> 02:06:24,990
tweet this guy.
So after the Brussels attack,

2802
02:06:25,530 --> 02:06:28,230
there was a guy,
just a regular dude who tweeted,

2803
02:06:29,480 --> 02:06:33,930
I confronted a Muslim woman yesterday.
I asked her to explain Brussels,

2804
02:06:34,050 --> 02:06:36,870
she said nothing to do with me.
Immediately.

2805
02:06:36,871 --> 02:06:41,820
Mouth reply that cools the media storm
because they were like,

2806
02:06:41,821 --> 02:06:44,700
well yeah,
there were lots of like funny reactions

2807
02:06:44,701 --> 02:06:45,720
to that.
What people will like,

2808
02:06:45,721 --> 02:06:46,650
you know,
I asked an IRA,

2809
02:06:46,651 --> 02:06:49,050
I've met an Irish person and asked them
to explain the IRA.

2810
02:06:49,080 --> 02:06:51,780
He said nothing to do with me.
I'm mainly math reply.

2811
02:06:52,120 --> 02:06:52,580
Oh,
you know,

2812
02:06:52,580 --> 02:06:55,110
I,
I asked a dog why I was bitten by a dog

2813
02:06:55,111 --> 02:06:56,160
when I was four.
He said,

2814
02:06:56,161 --> 02:06:57,420
woof,
mainly math reply.

2815
02:06:57,720 --> 02:07:01,860
But this guy was arrested.
He was arrested on suspicion of inciting

2816
02:07:01,861 --> 02:07:03,980
racial hatred.
Wow.

2817
02:07:04,560 --> 02:07:07,740
And in the UK,
that's what can happen,

2818
02:07:07,741 --> 02:07:12,240
like in the UK,
simply saying that Islam is a problem

2819
02:07:12,540 --> 02:07:15,630
and or Islamic stupid can get you
potentially arrested.

2820
02:07:15,880 --> 02:07:17,610
Wow.
Under blasphemy laws.

2821
02:07:17,640 --> 02:07:20,550
Look at this.
He subsequently expressed concerns for

2822
02:07:20,551 --> 02:07:22,440
his health,
was taken to a nearby hospital.

2823
02:07:22,441 --> 02:07:24,060
He's probably having a fucking heart
attack.

2824
02:07:24,510 --> 02:07:26,730
Doyle's tweet,
which has since been deleted.

2825
02:07:26,731 --> 02:07:28,150
Read.
I confronted a one.

2826
02:07:28,160 --> 02:07:29,610
Okay.
Mealy mouth or par.

2827
02:07:29,940 --> 02:07:32,610
Wow.
That is quite a few offensive things.

2828
02:07:32,611 --> 02:07:35,170
He was like,
in response to people getting angry with

2829
02:07:35,171 --> 02:07:35,671
him,
he was like,

2830
02:07:35,671 --> 02:07:36,910
oh,
so I offended a towel,

2831
02:07:36,911 --> 02:07:37,744
head,
big deal.

2832
02:07:38,020 --> 02:07:40,330
So you know,
he's not maybe the nicest guy in the

2833
02:07:40,331 --> 02:07:41,410
world,
but when you come,

2834
02:07:41,411 --> 02:07:42,670
when you live in a country.
Yeah,

2835
02:07:42,700 --> 02:07:44,290
when you live in a country with the
first amendment,

2836
02:07:44,291 --> 02:07:46,570
it's pretty fucking crazy that a person
can say something,

2837
02:07:46,571 --> 02:07:49,300
can tweet something like that and then
get arrested.

2838
02:07:49,330 --> 02:07:53,140
So tamid has got some issues to camera.
Has issues with comedians.

2839
02:07:53,320 --> 02:07:54,153
Yup.
There was

2840
02:07:54,320 --> 02:07:58,850
one comedian,
I'm in Montreal that made a joke about

2841
02:07:59,630 --> 02:08:04,630
some kid that was dying and he,
the kid survived and all these people

2842
02:08:06,831 --> 02:08:10,670
had donated money apparently.
So he made some joke about,

2843
02:08:11,020 --> 02:08:13,220
you know,
how the fuck is this kid still alive?

2844
02:08:13,250 --> 02:08:17,180
Something along those lines and I'm just
trying to be funny.

2845
02:08:17,181 --> 02:08:21,680
And he's been fighting it in court and
they're trying to put him in jail.

2846
02:08:21,890 --> 02:08:25,980
And this other kid in Vancouver,
the guy who was on stage and some women

2847
02:08:25,990 --> 02:08:29,270
were heckling and uh,
he said something about them being ugly,

2848
02:08:29,271 --> 02:08:33,520
lesbians and some mean shit to them.
He got sued last.

2849
02:08:33,660 --> 02:08:36,170
I mean,
they're heckling at a comedy club and

2850
02:08:36,370 --> 02:08:39,950
you know what he said,
whether it was skillful or not,

2851
02:08:39,951 --> 02:08:40,730
whether it's,
I mean,

2852
02:08:40,730 --> 02:08:44,570
it's not like someone just yelling
something to someone out randomly.

2853
02:08:44,810 --> 02:08:49,810
This is someone trying to handle a
heckler ad libbing in a comedy club with

2854
02:08:49,851 --> 02:08:53,870
a bunch of drunk people and these
hecklers who had been fucking up the

2855
02:08:53,871 --> 02:08:57,620
show up until the time he got there.
So he's trying to wreck them and make

2856
02:08:57,621 --> 02:09:02,030
them feel bad.
They sued him and won unbelievable force

2857
02:09:02,060 --> 02:09:07,060
comic to pay $15,000 for tirade of ugly
words against lesbian patron after

2858
02:09:07,551 --> 02:09:09,200
appeals falls flat.

2859
02:09:09,560 --> 02:09:14,560
Like why pay 15,000 comedy show?
Because he insulted somebody.

2860
02:09:16,190 --> 02:09:17,840
Yeah.
I got to tell you,

2861
02:09:17,841 --> 02:09:19,790
I haven't seen anything that bad in
Australia,

2862
02:09:19,791 --> 02:09:24,440
but it is also bad in Australia in terms
of like what frustrates me the most is

2863
02:09:24,441 --> 02:09:27,080
that people from certain ethnic groups
or religions,

2864
02:09:27,710 --> 02:09:29,090
uh,
claiming that you can be,

2865
02:09:29,120 --> 02:09:31,100
you can bless fame.
You can,

2866
02:09:31,101 --> 02:09:32,490
what do you call it?
When you defend that,

2867
02:09:32,510 --> 02:09:34,520
right?
You can defame like a religion or

2868
02:09:34,521 --> 02:09:35,270
ethnicity.

2869
02:09:35,270 --> 02:09:36,081
Hold on,
look at that.

2870
02:09:36,081 --> 02:09:38,060
Jamie.
Scientists say they've developed a

2871
02:09:38,061 --> 02:09:41,390
second skin you can wear for more than a
day to look younger.

2872
02:09:41,480 --> 02:09:44,510
What?
What the fuck,

2873
02:09:45,230 --> 02:09:47,150
dude,
you're going to go out some old lady or

2874
02:09:47,151 --> 02:09:48,230
old man,
whatever,

2875
02:09:48,820 --> 02:09:50,930
and you're going to think I found the
perfect guy.

2876
02:09:51,710 --> 02:09:53,300
Wow.
Get beautiful skin.

2877
02:09:54,290 --> 02:09:55,470
Smells like an old guy,
but

2878
02:09:57,650 --> 02:10:00,920
the idea sounds like fantasy and
invisible film that can be painted on

2879
02:10:00,921 --> 02:10:05,210
your skin and give it the elasticity of
youth bags under the eyes and finish and

2880
02:10:05,230 --> 02:10:08,180
seconds wrinkles disappear and this is
from the national post,

2881
02:10:08,181 --> 02:10:10,760
which is an actual publication.
This isn't bullshit.

2882
02:10:10,770 --> 02:10:13,640
Hundred 70 people have tried it under
eye bags.

2883
02:10:13,670 --> 02:10:16,850
No reported an irritation or reactions.
Whoa.

2884
02:10:17,620 --> 02:10:21,260
Bags are just to start.
You can soak the film was sunscreen and

2885
02:10:21,261 --> 02:10:24,490
protect yourself without worrying about
sweat or water washing it away.

2886
02:10:24,491 --> 02:10:27,140
The researchers say they expect it can
be used to treat Eczema,

2887
02:10:27,320 --> 02:10:30,500
psoriasis and other skin conditions by
covering dry,

2888
02:10:30,530 --> 02:10:33,170
itchy patches with a film that
moisturizes and soothes.

2889
02:10:33,620 --> 02:10:36,050
Whoa,
I'm going to get me some of that,

2890
02:10:36,080 --> 02:10:37,760
but you know,
that's one of those weird things where I

2891
02:10:37,761 --> 02:10:40,790
would have never even thought that
someone would come up with this idea.

2892
02:10:41,300 --> 02:10:42,140
It's clever though,
right?

2893
02:10:42,141 --> 02:10:44,630
It's amazing.
They developed a two step process.

2894
02:10:44,631 --> 02:10:47,350
A polymer,
a clear liquid is applied it.

2895
02:10:47,480 --> 02:10:52,070
It's chains are not very strong though,
so the next step is applying a product

2896
02:10:52,071 --> 02:10:54,680
that links them together.
By modifying the chemistry of the

2897
02:10:54,681 --> 02:10:56,810
chains.
The researchers can alter the properties

2898
02:10:56,811 --> 02:10:59,630
of the second skin depending on how it
will be used,

2899
02:10:59,631 --> 02:11:02,780
making it more or less permeable.
For example,

2900
02:11:02,990 --> 02:11:07,010
a more permeable second skin might be
used for under eye bags were a less

2901
02:11:07,011 --> 02:11:10,640
permeable one might hold a medication in
place.

2902
02:11:10,641 --> 02:11:13,420
It can be removed with a solution that
dissolves the Palmer.

2903
02:11:13,460 --> 02:11:15,260
Whoa.
We're plastic people.

2904
02:11:15,360 --> 02:11:19,910
The love of Jesus Christ.
Well as if the fucking Kardashians more

2905
02:11:19,911 --> 02:11:22,510
on plastic enough,
they're going to have plastic faces.

2906
02:11:22,620 --> 02:11:24,480
By the time it is going to look 20
again,

2907
02:11:25,110 --> 02:11:28,110
by the time I need to get botox or any
kind of facial surgery,

2908
02:11:28,111 --> 02:11:29,710
I'm not going to need it anymore.
There you go.

2909
02:11:30,040 --> 02:11:32,370
Spray some polymer on my face to a lag
by you.

2910
02:11:32,371 --> 02:11:33,940
You make lemonade.
Exactly.

2911
02:11:33,941 --> 02:11:36,330
I see something and you go,
this is a positive on this.

2912
02:11:36,660 --> 02:11:38,250
Fuck.
Having plastic people.

2913
02:11:38,251 --> 02:11:39,960
I wonder if they feel like rubbers
though.

2914
02:11:40,260 --> 02:11:44,220
Like you know like he touched people.
It feels good like skin touching skin.

2915
02:11:44,610 --> 02:11:46,530
I wonder if all the sudden it's like
touching a rubber.

2916
02:11:47,010 --> 02:11:48,690
Well especially if you're wearing it
right?

2917
02:11:49,170 --> 02:11:51,390
Like if someone caresses your,
your cheek.

2918
02:11:51,391 --> 02:11:54,420
Does it just feel like why don't worry
about what they feel like.

2919
02:11:54,421 --> 02:11:57,570
Because your hands I'm assuming won't be
covered by this shit.

2920
02:11:57,630 --> 02:11:58,590
No,
you wouldn't cover the.

2921
02:11:58,930 --> 02:12:01,830
Unless you really.
Unless you're like my fingertips give

2922
02:12:01,831 --> 02:12:02,640
away my age.

2923
02:12:02,640 --> 02:12:04,560
I don't like when I take baths in my
skin.

2924
02:12:04,561 --> 02:12:09,561
Prunes so he can do something.
A really hot bath and then spray some

2925
02:12:09,841 --> 02:12:11,250
polar moment.
My fingertips.

2926
02:12:11,340 --> 02:12:13,260
What the fuck man.
That's great.

2927
02:12:13,290 --> 02:12:14,940
We're going to cover ourselves with
rubber.

2928
02:12:15,510 --> 02:12:16,343
We're gonna.
See,

2929
02:12:16,470 --> 02:12:18,750
I mean the fact that we've got enough
money to be thinking about this.

2930
02:12:18,751 --> 02:12:22,230
Like coming back to the question about
like poaching elephants in Africa or

2931
02:12:22,250 --> 02:12:25,110
Megan to the Mumbai slum.
Like what the fuck is the world on about

2932
02:12:25,140 --> 02:12:27,690
when you talk about the inequality
between Beverly Hills and Baltimore,

2933
02:12:27,691 --> 02:12:30,930
what about the inequality between people
who are inventing polymers so that we

2934
02:12:30,931 --> 02:12:33,840
can spray them on our bet,
our eye bags so that we look a little

2935
02:12:33,841 --> 02:12:38,841
bit less old at the same time as there
are people living on a penny a day in

2936
02:12:39,151 --> 02:12:40,070
Mumbai?
Yes.

2937
02:12:40,110 --> 02:12:42,120
And Naughty.
Like if you were an alien and came down

2938
02:12:42,121 --> 02:12:44,520
to the earth right now,
you'd be like,

2939
02:12:44,521 --> 02:12:46,980
what are these guys doing?
They got plenty to go around.

2940
02:12:47,040 --> 02:12:47,970
They got tons of shit.

2941
02:12:48,100 --> 02:12:50,890
That's a super good point.
And there's something that I was reading

2942
02:12:50,891 --> 02:12:55,891
about today about a type of polymer that
they've used on.

2943
02:12:56,080 --> 02:12:57,010
Um,
God,

2944
02:12:57,011 --> 02:12:59,580
what was it on?
It was on certain,

2945
02:12:59,790 --> 02:13:01,240
you know,
let me find the history here.

2946
02:13:01,510 --> 02:13:03,410
It was on certain,
um,

2947
02:13:05,140 --> 02:13:06,830
certain types of,
uh,

2948
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:11,740
it's like a plastic that could spray on
things and when they spray this shit on

2949
02:13:11,741 --> 02:13:14,500
things it um,
it actually,

2950
02:13:14,501 --> 02:13:15,190
uh,
you could,

2951
02:13:15,190 --> 02:13:19,510
you could throw like cinder blocks off
of buildings and shit because of it.

2952
02:13:19,990 --> 02:13:22,090
Wait in the cinder block is okay or.
Yeah,

2953
02:13:22,091 --> 02:13:22,541
yeah,
yeah.

2954
02:13:22,541 --> 02:13:25,570
The cinder block stays together.
It's fucking madness pool.

2955
02:13:25,870 --> 02:13:28,060
It's really weird.
Let me guess.

2956
02:13:28,061 --> 02:13:30,940
The military developed.
It sounds like something like that

2957
02:13:30,960 --> 02:13:31,980
probably let

2958
02:13:31,980 --> 02:13:36,960
me find this stuff because it's some
shit that they spray on things and

2959
02:13:37,100 --> 02:13:39,480
they're using an uncertain automobiles.

2960
02:13:40,150 --> 02:13:40,983
Uh,
it's like,

2961
02:13:41,080 --> 02:13:42,310
hold on,
let me find it real quick.

2962
02:13:42,400 --> 02:13:43,233
It's,
um,

2963
02:13:43,240 --> 02:13:45,490
in the meantime,
you can open your podcast app and

2964
02:13:45,700 --> 02:13:47,890
subscribe to the way the people live.
There you go,

2965
02:13:48,820 --> 02:13:53,380
hold on one line and you can get more
delightful conversations with the likes

2966
02:13:53,381 --> 02:13:55,200
of myself.
It's called finance.

2967
02:13:55,350 --> 02:14:00,120
Thanks Jamie.
Google line x polymer coating because

2968
02:14:00,121 --> 02:14:02,010
this stuff,
they put it on,

2969
02:14:02,080 --> 02:14:04,330
um,
on plates and they throw it off a

2970
02:14:04,331 --> 02:14:05,250
buildings like,
look,

2971
02:14:05,280 --> 02:14:06,900
they threw this does on the history
channel.

2972
02:14:07,350 --> 02:14:10,200
They threw these cinderblocks off of,
uh,

2973
02:14:10,590 --> 02:14:15,210
off of a building and then they cover
the cinder block with paint and then

2974
02:14:15,211 --> 02:14:19,680
they throw the same cinderblock,
same size cinder block off a building

2975
02:14:19,920 --> 02:14:21,690
that's covered in this protective
coating.

2976
02:14:21,691 --> 02:14:24,300
And watch what happens.
It just found sentences.

2977
02:14:24,720 --> 02:14:27,000
Now they did it with eggs,
man,

2978
02:14:27,330 --> 02:14:30,090
they did it with plates,
they did it with eggs.

2979
02:14:30,390 --> 02:14:34,380
And then on top of that,
they did it with plastic cups where they

2980
02:14:34,381 --> 02:14:37,680
had a sumo wrestler stand on plastic
cups,

2981
02:14:38,200 --> 02:14:40,240
like look at the egg.
So they're spraying the egg.

2982
02:14:40,270 --> 02:14:43,890
And by the way this is like less than a
quarter inch coating that they put on

2983
02:14:43,891 --> 02:14:44,910
these eggs.
Boom,

2984
02:14:45,240 --> 02:14:46,580
bounces off the ground.
Wow.

2985
02:14:46,710 --> 02:14:50,400
This is crazy shit.
But look at the cups is the really weird

2986
02:14:50,401 --> 02:14:53,370
stuff.
They took this gigantic sumo wrestler

2987
02:14:53,371 --> 02:14:56,430
and they had him stand on these plastic
cups.

2988
02:14:56,431 --> 02:14:59,640
Of course he crushes them.
Then they take the same kind of cup and

2989
02:14:59,641 --> 02:15:01,860
they cover it with this line x shit.
Go Way,

2990
02:15:01,861 --> 02:15:02,760
way back.
Wait,

2991
02:15:03,010 --> 02:15:05,850
wait.
There's a sumo wrestler dude you can see

2992
02:15:05,851 --> 02:15:07,740
easily.
Obviously you can just a little sippy

2993
02:15:07,741 --> 02:15:07,950
cup.

2994
02:15:07,950 --> 02:15:10,970
It's a red like Red Cup from a frat
party or something.

2995
02:15:10,971 --> 02:15:12,140
Go way further ahead.
Jamie [inaudible].

2996
02:15:12,141 --> 02:15:13,730
He crushes you,
but go away for it.

2997
02:15:13,731 --> 02:15:15,380
No Watch.
Look at this.

2998
02:15:15,660 --> 02:15:20,660
He's standing on to read like be a cops
and they're not much big.

2999
02:15:20,810 --> 02:15:22,490
You look,
they're not much bigger.

3000
02:15:22,900 --> 02:15:26,030
It's not like daily became super thick
because of this stuff.

3001
02:15:26,720 --> 02:15:29,060
So this must just.
What does it do?

3002
02:15:29,061 --> 02:15:31,160
I guess it just disperses the energy of
the.

3003
02:15:31,400 --> 02:15:33,410
I don't know,
the full all across the.

3004
02:15:34,060 --> 02:15:35,600
The product.
I don't know man.

3005
02:15:35,601 --> 02:15:37,280
It's some super fucking polymer.
I mean,

3006
02:15:37,281 --> 02:15:39,230
what would you use it for?
You just use it to make everything

3007
02:15:39,231 --> 02:15:40,400
strong I guess.
Yeah.

3008
02:15:40,401 --> 02:15:44,030
I guess our cover your fucking whole
body with bro become iron man.

3009
02:15:44,420 --> 02:15:48,110
Become like a thing from fantastic for,
you know?

3010
02:15:48,150 --> 02:15:49,100
Yeah.
Put a little bit of a.

3011
02:15:49,130 --> 02:15:51,800
put the old,
put the anti aging polymer on first.

3012
02:15:51,860 --> 02:15:54,140
Then put this shit on jumping off a
building and bounce.

3013
02:15:54,200 --> 02:15:55,470
Dude.
That's what I'm looking at.

3014
02:15:55,730 --> 02:15:59,610
Just run right through walls.
Shit you recommend when you're going to

3015
02:15:59,630 --> 02:16:02,570
do that.
I think in 100 years from now,

3016
02:16:02,660 --> 02:16:07,660
science and technology will have
achieved results that are unfathomable.

3017
02:16:07,790 --> 02:16:10,080
Yeah.
I think we are just in the infancy.

3018
02:16:10,100 --> 02:16:14,090
I mean go back to 1916.
People lived like fucking cave people

3019
02:16:14,610 --> 02:16:17,050
there.
There were barely human monkeys.

3020
02:16:17,270 --> 02:16:18,360
Yeah.
And think about what,

3021
02:16:18,390 --> 02:16:22,730
what we're experiencing now in 2016 now
imagine what 2000,

3022
02:16:22,731 --> 02:16:25,310
116 is going to be like.
Well also think about it.

3023
02:16:25,360 --> 02:16:29,060
Think about if we can ever do like what
Ray Kurzweil wants us to do and be able

3024
02:16:29,080 --> 02:16:32,950
to unite like artificial intelligence
with our our intelligence.

3025
02:16:32,980 --> 02:16:34,810
I think it's inevitable.
If that happens,

3026
02:16:34,811 --> 02:16:36,730
then that's going to be a big game
changer.

3027
02:16:36,731 --> 02:16:39,880
That all of the physiological things
that we've been able to do in terms of

3028
02:16:39,881 --> 02:16:42,700
the evolution since the industrial
revolution where it's going to be like

3029
02:16:42,730 --> 02:16:47,730
an information revolution and we're
going to become cosmic gods in some sort

3030
02:16:47,741 --> 02:16:48,640
of a weird way.

3031
02:16:48,640 --> 02:16:50,920
I think it's inevitable because I just
think it.

3032
02:16:51,050 --> 02:16:54,600
As long as we don't blow ourselves up or
get hit by a meteor or a supervolcano

3033
02:16:54,760 --> 02:16:57,010
wipes out the planet,
I think it's inevitable.

3034
02:16:57,011 --> 02:16:58,600
We're going to continue.
Not We,

3035
02:16:58,630 --> 02:17:00,430
not you and I.
We're not going to do shit.

3036
02:17:00,940 --> 02:17:02,710
Where's it going to be talking?
Speak for yourself.

3037
02:17:03,590 --> 02:17:06,370
Don't be the first one.
We're just going to be talking,

3038
02:17:06,430 --> 02:17:08,680
but there's gonna be other people out
there that are really fucking smart.

3039
02:17:08,681 --> 02:17:11,310
They're going to come together with some
other really smart people and they're

3040
02:17:11,320 --> 02:17:15,760
going to figure out some amazing things
and we were just watching it that I'd

3041
02:17:15,761 --> 02:17:19,120
love to make skin shit when we.
When people wonder about why we haven't

3042
02:17:19,121 --> 02:17:23,080
found extraterrestrial civilizations yet
and we haven't heard their radio waves.

3043
02:17:23,480 --> 02:17:27,730
I'm so hopeful that the reason is that
like we just evolve out of that.

3044
02:17:27,730 --> 02:17:29,560
We've only had them for less than 100
years.

3045
02:17:29,561 --> 02:17:30,970
Right,
and we don't have been pumping them out

3046
02:17:30,971 --> 02:17:34,450
for Henri is maybe a.
maybe we're just about to find something

3047
02:17:34,451 --> 02:17:37,210
else and we'll realize that the universe
is actually teeming with all these

3048
02:17:37,211 --> 02:17:39,970
conversations between different
civilizations that we are just

3049
02:17:39,971 --> 02:17:43,540
completely oblivious to and they don't
care about reaching out to us because

3050
02:17:43,541 --> 02:17:46,900
we're just little ants on a.
on a little rock floating around,

3051
02:17:46,920 --> 02:17:51,400
a star on an outer spiral arm of an
insignificant galaxy called Milky Way

3052
02:17:51,730 --> 02:17:53,890
and they're like,
some of these guys will grow up and

3053
02:17:53,891 --> 02:17:55,360
they'll join the conversation when
they're ready.

3054
02:17:55,570 --> 02:17:59,170
It's probably exactly what's going on.
Or it gets to the point where it's no

3055
02:17:59,171 --> 02:18:03,130
longer necessary because intelligence
and artificial intelligence become

3056
02:18:03,131 --> 02:18:07,270
exactly the same thing and we create a
different kind of life with technology

3057
02:18:07,271 --> 02:18:11,200
in our pursuit.
Like this fucking this ibm machine

3058
02:18:11,201 --> 02:18:14,120
that's beating people that go game,
you know,

3059
02:18:14,230 --> 02:18:18,850
killing chess champions at their fucking
preferred game that one day they're

3060
02:18:18,851 --> 02:18:22,030
going to,
it's going to reach some sort of a state

3061
02:18:22,031 --> 02:18:27,031
where we have to accept it as a life
form and it has rights because it has a

3062
02:18:27,071 --> 02:18:28,090
conception of itself.

3063
02:18:28,120 --> 02:18:32,440
Can it go in any bathroom at once he
comes to computers walking to the

3064
02:18:32,441 --> 02:18:35,650
bathroom.
I was talking to someone who is,

3065
02:18:35,710 --> 02:18:37,390
who was saying that,
uh,

3066
02:18:37,420 --> 02:18:41,320
when we can grow artificial meat because
they're working on artificial meat in a

3067
02:18:41,321 --> 02:18:44,530
lab.
And then will it be the case that the

3068
02:18:44,531 --> 02:18:47,290
only ethical meat to eight,
uh,

3069
02:18:47,350 --> 02:18:51,490
that isn't artificial would be human
mate because we're the only people

3070
02:18:51,491 --> 02:18:56,170
capable of giving informed consent to
have ourselves be eaten by ourselves.

3071
02:18:56,171 --> 02:18:58,540
It would be,
maybe we can take all these fat people

3072
02:18:58,720 --> 02:19:01,540
and we could like suck body meet off of
them.

3073
02:19:01,690 --> 02:19:04,270
They'd be like,
I really wish I was thinner when you go

3074
02:19:04,271 --> 02:19:07,720
to a place and with no scars,
with 30 percent of your body weight

3075
02:19:07,730 --> 02:19:10,220
polymer that I can spray on you,
which just extract some of your,

3076
02:19:10,221 --> 02:19:12,130
uh,
your fat and calories and into a

3077
02:19:12,131 --> 02:19:15,700
smoothie for me to sell it as protein
bars that you mentioned,

3078
02:19:15,701 --> 02:19:16,930
the Gauguin,
the computer that,

3079
02:19:16,990 --> 02:19:20,130
that Bates people that go.
The thing that I find really fascinating

3080
02:19:20,410 --> 02:19:25,410
about that is the computer that Bates
people at chess is basically just a

3081
02:19:25,901 --> 02:19:27,950
brute number cruncher,
right?

3082
02:19:27,951 --> 02:19:28,130
So

3083
02:19:28,130 --> 02:19:31,070
deep blue and deep blue won whatever was
it Kasparov.

3084
02:19:31,580 --> 02:19:34,260
Um,
what that basically does is just looks

3085
02:19:34,280 --> 02:19:38,420
at all the different possible outcomes
that you might be about to play and then

3086
02:19:38,421 --> 02:19:41,990
rapidly calculates the probability that
any particular move is going to yield a

3087
02:19:41,991 --> 02:19:43,010
good result.
Right?

3088
02:19:43,011 --> 02:19:45,650
We can all imagine how that,
how that functions.

3089
02:19:45,651 --> 02:19:47,210
It's basically just lots and lots of
numbers,

3090
02:19:47,750 --> 02:19:52,750
but go is so complicated.
There are so many different options at

3091
02:19:52,791 --> 02:19:57,530
any particular point in the game that no
computer can even remotely and probably

3092
02:19:57,531 --> 02:20:00,290
ever will be able to calculate the game
itself.

3093
02:20:00,291 --> 02:20:01,870
The way that the chess computer does
there.

3094
02:20:01,880 --> 02:20:05,480
There are more options I think in a game
of go then there are like atoms in the

3095
02:20:05,481 --> 02:20:09,660
universe at some crazy stat like that.
So what the go compete,

3096
02:20:09,690 --> 02:20:11,810
I know went fuck that.

3097
02:20:16,010 --> 02:20:18,260
It's the power of exponential.
Right?

3098
02:20:18,261 --> 02:20:21,140
So like if there's,
if there are two options and then those

3099
02:20:21,141 --> 02:20:23,870
two options each lead to another two
options which include to another two

3100
02:20:23,871 --> 02:20:26,780
options which actually not have the two
options very quickly you get up to

3101
02:20:26,781 --> 02:20:29,720
numbers that are those thought
experiments of how many times would you

3102
02:20:29,721 --> 02:20:33,620
have to fold a piece of paper for it to
reach the moon and it's only like 30 or

3103
02:20:33,621 --> 02:20:36,260
40 times or something ridiculous like
that because it's doubling all the time.

3104
02:20:36,261 --> 02:20:38,600
Can you look that up Jamie?
How many times do you need to fold a

3105
02:20:38,601 --> 02:20:41,360
piece of paper for tuition to the moon?
But anyway,

3106
02:20:41,430 --> 02:20:46,220
so the point about the go computer is it
doesn't crunch numbers,

3107
02:20:46,310 --> 02:20:51,310
it learns from other go games,
so they load into it all of the go game

3108
02:20:53,091 --> 02:20:58,091
like thousands or millions of games that
have happened and it then looks at all

3109
02:20:58,311 --> 02:21:01,410
of those games and tries to find
patterns between the way the,

3110
02:21:01,420 --> 02:21:03,830
the,
the particular moves that humans have

3111
02:21:03,831 --> 02:21:08,831
done in past games and then uses its own
intuition to run billions of possible

3112
02:21:10,881 --> 02:21:12,170
games in its own head.

3113
02:21:12,620 --> 02:21:15,260
And it gradually learns from its own
mistakes.

3114
02:21:15,830 --> 02:21:18,850
So it's not just a computer,
it's not just like a gigantic calculator

3115
02:21:18,851 --> 02:21:22,700
like the chess computer is,
is a form of artificial intelligence in

3116
02:21:22,701 --> 02:21:26,780
that it is making calculations.
I mean obviously it doesn't know

3117
02:21:26,781 --> 02:21:30,020
anything we don't think but it.
But for me it's really super exciting

3118
02:21:30,021 --> 02:21:33,830
because I do think that it's really
interesting to ask the cheering test

3119
02:21:33,831 --> 02:21:36,710
question of like when is the computer
actually self aware?

3120
02:21:37,070 --> 02:21:38,810
And this is the beginning glimmers of
that.

3121
02:21:38,811 --> 02:21:43,760
I think within our lifetime there will
be computers that it's just meaningless

3122
02:21:43,761 --> 02:21:46,160
to say they're not self aware because
they claimed to be self aware.

3123
02:21:46,161 --> 02:21:47,750
They they behave as if they're self
aware,

3124
02:21:47,751 --> 02:21:50,300
they tell us that they feel pain,
they tell us that they have an interest

3125
02:21:50,301 --> 02:21:52,790
in their own,
continued existence in a way that's so

3126
02:21:52,791 --> 02:21:57,440
authentic and that learns that to say
that they're not self aware,

3127
02:21:57,441 --> 02:21:59,270
but like a chimp is would be
meaningless.

3128
02:21:59,480 --> 02:22:00,810
Do you think that they're going to say
start

3129
02:22:00,930 --> 02:22:04,320
by just trolling people on twitter with
like fake intelligence,

3130
02:22:04,380 --> 02:22:06,600
like imagine this guy that you're
arguing with on twitter.

3131
02:22:06,830 --> 02:22:09,870
He to be a person and they just realize
what,

3132
02:22:09,930 --> 02:22:14,670
what riles people up with spins their
gears and they just start sending these

3133
02:22:14,671 --> 02:22:19,110
troll twitter things out and they just
started having debates with people like

3134
02:22:19,111 --> 02:22:22,560
literally having debates and breaking
people down and then being passive

3135
02:22:22,561 --> 02:22:24,480
aggressive,
being shitty,

3136
02:22:25,020 --> 02:22:28,170
being inquisitive.
Like they try a bunch of different

3137
02:22:28,171 --> 02:22:30,150
approaches and they treat it the same
way.

3138
02:22:30,570 --> 02:22:33,590
They treat go games.
They just learned behavior

3139
02:22:33,630 --> 02:22:36,240
patterns.
That would be the worst people in the

3140
02:22:36,241 --> 02:22:39,390
world and if they learned their behavior
patterns off the way that we communicate

3141
02:22:39,391 --> 02:22:40,290
on social media,

3142
02:22:41,680 --> 02:22:43,440
you'd just be creating a monster.
Well,

3143
02:22:43,510 --> 02:22:44,530
it makes you wonder.
I mean,

3144
02:22:44,531 --> 02:22:47,500
if go games are that complicated,
yet they're able to master that.

3145
02:22:47,830 --> 02:22:50,200
What about human personality?
What do we do?

3146
02:22:50,201 --> 02:22:54,610
We kid ourselves in that we're so
complex and amazing that nothing could

3147
02:22:54,611 --> 02:22:59,611
copy us mean what if some fucking
computer figures out a way to bypass

3148
02:23:00,881 --> 02:23:02,680
personality?
Personality is overrated.

3149
02:23:02,681 --> 02:23:04,690
We figured out a way to make the perfect
personality.

3150
02:23:04,691 --> 02:23:06,490
This is the formula.
Run with it.

3151
02:23:06,550 --> 02:23:07,540
Everyone's going to love you.

3152
02:23:08,370 --> 02:23:11,490
Did you see that movie about I'm a x
Mokena.

3153
02:23:11,730 --> 02:23:12,710
See that?
Amazing.

3154
02:23:12,720 --> 02:23:14,190
No,
that's Kinda the conceit of that.

3155
02:23:14,191 --> 02:23:16,260
Right?
So there's this sort of the billionaire

3156
02:23:16,261 --> 02:23:19,620
kind of leader,
the Mark Zuckerberg type in that the way

3157
02:23:19,621 --> 02:23:22,800
that he builds the artificial
intelligence is by hoovering up all of

3158
02:23:22,801 --> 02:23:24,330
the.
All of your social media information

3159
02:23:24,331 --> 02:23:28,200
from his facebook style thing,
and I think you're right,

3160
02:23:28,230 --> 02:23:32,490
that that could be one way of creating
an artificial intelligence to collect

3161
02:23:32,491 --> 02:23:37,020
all of the communal inputs that we're
putting in every single day on social

3162
02:23:37,021 --> 02:23:38,190
media.
One hundred percent,

3163
02:23:38,340 --> 02:23:40,830
100 percent possible to learn those
patterns.

3164
02:23:40,870 --> 02:23:41,641
Yeah.
Jamie,

3165
02:23:41,641 --> 02:23:42,660
how many,
how many times?

3166
02:23:42,690 --> 02:23:45,000
I was just gonna say there's a specific
episode of that show,

3167
02:23:45,001 --> 02:23:47,940
Black Mirror I've been trying to tell
you about that deals with this exact

3168
02:23:47,941 --> 02:23:52,650
topic where there's some sort of like
android created thing and they take this

3169
02:23:52,651 --> 02:23:55,170
guy,
this whole social media presence and

3170
02:23:55,171 --> 02:23:56,610
recruit.
That's what his new being.

3171
02:23:56,611 --> 02:23:58,400
He died.
I don't want to ruin all of the.

3172
02:23:58,800 --> 02:23:59,760
Yeah,
it's Donald.

3173
02:24:01,290 --> 02:24:03,090
Yeah.
Same Guy.

3174
02:24:03,091 --> 02:24:05,590
The actor that's in next Maki now,
so it's a little bit.

3175
02:24:07,280 --> 02:24:09,020
Which guy?
The millionaire guy.

3176
02:24:09,090 --> 02:24:11,640
No,
the guy fucked over.

3177
02:24:11,800 --> 02:24:12,870
Yeah,
he's a good actor.

3178
02:24:12,960 --> 02:24:13,950
I gotta get Outta here,
man.

3179
02:24:13,980 --> 02:24:15,150
I'm sorry.
We're out of time.

3180
02:24:16,080 --> 02:24:19,290
Anytime time flew by.
Does it always does.

3181
02:24:19,340 --> 02:24:20,490
Always.
Does so much fun.

3182
02:24:20,550 --> 02:24:21,001
Yeah.
No,

3183
02:24:21,001 --> 02:24:23,200
I love it when you're back in town.
A denier,

3184
02:24:23,201 --> 02:24:25,440
but I'll give you a Holler at me.

3185
02:24:27,560 --> 02:24:31,220
My friends will be back tomorrow way
that people live and just apps on

3186
02:24:31,221 --> 02:24:32,570
twitter.
We the people live.

3187
02:24:32,660 --> 02:24:35,210
Just to pull myself out yet further.
Yeah,

3188
02:24:35,440 --> 02:24:36,273
it up,
baby.

3189
02:24:36,690 --> 02:24:39,630
Thanks man.
Tomorrow we'll be back with Alex grey.

3190
02:24:39,810 --> 02:24:43,950
A famed visionary artists should be a
goddamn blast.

3191
02:24:44,190 --> 02:24:45,260
See,
then you fucks.
