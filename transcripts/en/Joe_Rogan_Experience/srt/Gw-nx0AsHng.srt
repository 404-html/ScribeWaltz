1
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:02,850
Her low freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:05,330
Do you put the chains on man,

3
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:05,970
right.

4
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:06,571
Sweats off.

5
00:00:06,571 --> 00:00:08,040
Put those genes out right now,

6
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:10,490
Brian and a pair of the barbell jeans,

7
00:00:10,491 --> 00:00:11,760
so props to barbell jeans.

8
00:00:11,761 --> 00:00:15,600
Eddie Brown was just took it
the second large glass of Vino.

9
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:23,160
If you were in a fine restaurant,

10
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:24,650
it's a double son.

11
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:27,360
Come on most of course.

12
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,120
Wine glass.

13
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,260
He pours a slight sipping thing.

14
00:00:31,261 --> 00:00:31,710
It's a,

15
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:33,480
this is a delicious wine by the way.

16
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:34,993
Okay,

17
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,510
let me tell you something about Callin.

18
00:00:36,511 --> 00:00:38,490
This motherfucker knows his one.

19
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:41,370
I've got a dinner with him and he gets
in a conversation with this shit more.

20
00:00:41,371 --> 00:00:42,040
Yay.

21
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:42,873
The says,

22
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:47,880
what do you have in a burgundy
from 97 d and The guy goes,

23
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:48,840
oh shit.

24
00:00:48,841 --> 00:00:50,520
This motherfucker is for real.

25
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:53,100
Talking about different comp,

26
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:57,000
different grapes that are grown on
different hillsides and he'll explain,

27
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:00,550
he'll explain some shit we were at.

28
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,880
We ate at this restaurant
and the small we AA was like,

29
00:01:02,881 --> 00:01:03,600
yes,

30
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,050
correct.

31
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:04,621
That's correct.

32
00:01:04,621 --> 00:01:05,454
Correct.

33
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,160
He started,

34
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,260
he started talking about,

35
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:08,521
oh my God,

36
00:01:08,521 --> 00:01:09,690
I got to work on your technique.

37
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,110
You'd side kick is you
got to pick your knee up.

38
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:14,460
I think John Claude van Damme,

39
00:01:14,461 --> 00:01:15,510
where those two though,

40
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:18,210
for sure you have to
put your knee up higher.

41
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:20,090
They look good and it's nothing.

42
00:01:20,091 --> 00:01:21,570
It's nothing to do with stretching.

43
00:01:21,571 --> 00:01:24,230
It's just you just haven't
thrown a sidekick in a while.

44
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:25,613
A little rusty.

45
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:28,043
You can do it,

46
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,160
but you gotta put your
socks on before he came.

47
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:31,241
People ask,

48
00:01:31,241 --> 00:01:32,520
why do you want to put your socks on?

49
00:01:32,521 --> 00:01:33,510
Does that help your kicking?

50
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:35,160
You want to put a shoe on?

51
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:35,700
Oh,

52
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:36,810
you like to kick with shoes on.

53
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:43,230
Do you still wear those shiny shoes so
that you could throw a roundhouse kicks

54
00:01:43,231 --> 00:01:43,531
quicker?

55
00:01:43,531 --> 00:01:47,450
Cause you pivot if you have a shiny Sol,

56
00:01:47,451 --> 00:01:49,020
like that's terrible.

57
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:51,660
You got to pick your knee up.

58
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:53,370
Nope.

59
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:55,380
See it's not bad,

60
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,980
but you have an inherent flaw in your
technique that probably was never,

61
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:02,220
never explained to you for 49 million.

62
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,073
Ain't bad.

63
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:04,680
It's pretty good.

64
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,513
It's not right.

65
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,380
I wouldn't want to get hit by that.

66
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,120
I wouldn't want to get hit by

67
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:11,980
in the shower.

68
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:13,490
That's where you would get hit shit.

69
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:14,903
Oh Shit.

70
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:16,810
What's going on

71
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:18,720
Brian?

72
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,620
Stone spinning kicks,

73
00:02:19,621 --> 00:02:19,801
right.

74
00:02:19,801 --> 00:02:20,890
No Shit.

75
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:21,781
Dude.

76
00:02:21,781 --> 00:02:22,614
It's wrong.

77
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,400
Those sounds,

78
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,320
those genes are hell.

79
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:28,080
I used to being serious there.

80
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:28,741
Are you being serious?

81
00:02:28,741 --> 00:02:29,280
Show me what?

82
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,091
Show me a real front.

83
00:02:30,091 --> 00:02:30,970
Like psychic for real.

84
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:32,140
All Bullshit.

85
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:32,973
No bullshit.

86
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:33,950
Well,

87
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:34,783
just this,

88
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:35,540
just throw it.

89
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:36,373
Sure.

90
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,700
Let me see the spinning one though.

91
00:02:38,701 --> 00:02:40,110
The Woods show him spinning one.

92
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,000
Yeah,

93
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,440
that's my favorite that he does.

94
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:44,390
It's my favorite.

95
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:46,710
Too old tear you.

96
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:48,210
You just all you have to do different.

97
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:49,190
The all you're doing wrong.

98
00:02:49,191 --> 00:02:49,321
It's,

99
00:02:49,321 --> 00:02:50,400
you're coming up.

100
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:54,480
Your foot is going up from the ground
like an almost like a half moon,

101
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,100
right?

102
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:55,780
Yeah.

103
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:57,540
You want to get your knee up higher.

104
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,590
That's one of the cool things about jeans.

105
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:00,453
Way Higher than that.

106
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,130
You're are the cool
things about those genes,

107
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:03,100
those genes,

108
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,360
these genes that were wearing,

109
00:03:04,361 --> 00:03:05,320
they're like sweat pants,

110
00:03:05,321 --> 00:03:06,010
man.

111
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:06,221
You,

112
00:03:06,221 --> 00:03:06,881
she just had no,

113
00:03:06,881 --> 00:03:06,940
no,

114
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:07,480
no.

115
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,820
Don't throw the kick
until your knee is up.

116
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:12,310
Get your knee up first
and then throw the kick.

117
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:14,140
The problem is you're doing
both at the same time.

118
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:14,321
No,

119
00:03:14,321 --> 00:03:14,381
no,

120
00:03:14,381 --> 00:03:14,890
no.

121
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:16,570
Don't throw the kick
until your knees up high.

122
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,640
Lift your knee up way
high past your waist,

123
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:19,840
and then throw the kick.

124
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:21,400
Yes,

125
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,091
me up first.

126
00:03:22,091 --> 00:03:24,280
And then don't look over your stomach.

127
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:25,330
Look over your shoulder.

128
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:27,221
Yeah,

129
00:03:27,221 --> 00:03:28,720
but me first here.

130
00:03:28,721 --> 00:03:29,554
Hold on.

131
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:31,120
This fucking hysterical.

132
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:32,620
This is ridiculous.

133
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:34,220
This is so sad

134
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,790
is when I'm drunk.

135
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:37,683
I can't watch.

136
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,780
I can't watch

137
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:43,653
my part.

138
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:44,490
Pumped.

139
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:45,460
Joe is going to go off,

140
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:45,931
dude.

141
00:03:45,931 --> 00:03:46,751
Genes on genes,

142
00:03:46,751 --> 00:03:47,584
on genes.

143
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:48,600
Egg Up,

144
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,433
up here,

145
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:50,140
up here,

146
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:50,620
up the show.

147
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:51,161
Flexible.

148
00:03:51,161 --> 00:03:52,780
Quite companion from here.

149
00:03:52,781 --> 00:03:54,490
Turn your shoulder to the right.

150
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,990
Turn your shoulder to
the right to the right.

151
00:03:55,991 --> 00:03:57,370
Now extent extension.

152
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:58,360
Extense straight.

153
00:03:58,361 --> 00:03:59,350
Don't look over your stomach.

154
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,600
Look over your shoulder like this.

155
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,320
Like that.

156
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:02,950
That's how you look.

157
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:03,850
I know that's not the end.

158
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:04,930
That's the flexible,

159
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:06,161
flexible.

160
00:04:06,161 --> 00:04:07,360
You're fine right from here.

161
00:04:07,361 --> 00:04:08,194
Watch.

162
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:08,741
Oh,

163
00:04:08,741 --> 00:04:09,470
sons.

164
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:09,860
Okay.

165
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:10,750
Damn.

166
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:15,170
Even in the fucking Chuck Norris is lush.

167
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:17,850
You lift your knee up and then kick.

168
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:21,220
I still think John Claude van Damme
beats the fuck out of both of you first.

169
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:23,920
Then kick watch that one too.

170
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:24,221
Okay.

171
00:04:24,221 --> 00:04:24,540
Ready?

172
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,140
So I'm not mad at Joe's format.

173
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:26,974
All right.

174
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:28,083
No,

175
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,650
no one and then two.

176
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:30,610
One.

177
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:31,443
All right,

178
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,220
Eddie,

179
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:33,053
can you do play by play?

180
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:34,423
Shit.

181
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:35,800
Don't look over your stomach.

182
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:36,990
I don't know what the fuck is wrong.

183
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:37,380
Well,

184
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:39,280
I know John Claude van
Damme would be proud.

185
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:41,080
What are you telling your shoulder?

186
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:41,900
Look,

187
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,660
I'm throwing it up here.

188
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:44,830
Yeah,

189
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:45,630
I'm like this.

190
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:45,880
Okay.

191
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:46,713
I'm never like this.

192
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,710
Look at Joe's ass.

193
00:04:47,711 --> 00:04:48,544
When he throws the kick,

194
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:50,560
it's just looking at it.

195
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:51,360
Don't look,

196
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,151
don't look at the foot.

197
00:04:52,151 --> 00:04:53,040
He has a set of hunting.

198
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:55,960
You look at the foot honeydews
on them right into the glutes.

199
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:57,580
Looking deeply into them.

200
00:04:58,450 --> 00:04:58,751
Dude,

201
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:00,840
I'd love to see our
actual taekwondo match.

202
00:05:00,841 --> 00:05:02,020
Shrink Callen and relevant.

203
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:02,973
It's better.

204
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:05,440
I would just stare at their asses.

205
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:06,371
Do my Barbara.

206
00:05:06,371 --> 00:05:07,204
Okay.

207
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,410
Fucking monster.

208
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:09,131
They're awesome,

209
00:05:09,131 --> 00:05:09,580
right?

210
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:09,911
Yeah.

211
00:05:09,911 --> 00:05:10,900
Well you see my kicks.

212
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,193
You see my

213
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:16,510
fundamentally a little off.

214
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:17,200
Yeah,

215
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:17,591
a little bit.

216
00:05:17,591 --> 00:05:18,700
He's been here so you get there,

217
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:19,930
but that dose does,

218
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,940
that spin here is everybody fucks.

219
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:23,350
Everybody fucks that up.

220
00:05:23,351 --> 00:05:26,440
It's a number one thing about the side
kick that people get wrong and it changes

221
00:05:26,441 --> 00:05:27,274
everything.

222
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:28,480
If you learn as you it right,

223
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:29,650
you wanted to get that knee up high.

224
00:05:29,651 --> 00:05:30,990
The power differences.

225
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,500
Fucking substantial.

226
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:34,283
No,

227
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:36,063
no,

228
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:36,371
no.

229
00:05:36,371 --> 00:05:37,840
You just got to do it right.

230
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,220
[inaudible] with Rogan's help,

231
00:05:39,221 --> 00:05:40,570
you could be the best.

232
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:43,810
Kick yourself,

233
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:48,910
dear diary today.

234
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:49,773
Listen.

235
00:05:59,310 --> 00:05:59,360
Yeah.
