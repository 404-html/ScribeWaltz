1
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:01,591
Doh,

2
00:00:01,591 --> 00:00:01,831
Doh,

3
00:00:01,831 --> 00:00:02,071
Doh,

4
00:00:02,071 --> 00:00:02,311
Doh,

5
00:00:02,311 --> 00:00:02,581
Doh,

6
00:00:02,581 --> 00:00:03,680
Doh do.

7
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:05,580
We are live.

8
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:06,720
Hello Brian Red Ban.

9
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:07,620
Hey Joe,

10
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:08,520
what's going on fellow?

11
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,830
Not much crazy week.

12
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:12,720
Very crazy week murder

13
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:13,530
the comedy store.

14
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:14,130
Ugh,

15
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:14,740
that's,

16
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:17,000
that wasn't saying I was supposed
to go down there that night to me.

17
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:19,290
I decided the day of,

18
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:22,360
I had too much shit to do that day
and in the morning and I said no,

19
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:23,790
and I don't need to do a set tonight.

20
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:29,070
I was going to in Wam do the stand up
on the spot show which was on before the

21
00:00:29,071 --> 00:00:33,630
roast battle show and I guess where
is the show going on in the main room?

22
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:34,650
Um,

23
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:36,870
it was one of those air quotes.

24
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:38,430
Urban air quote.

25
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:40,133
Yeah.

26
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:45,180
They scratch records and they have more
melanin and some shit went down and I'm

27
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:47,041
not that it matters.

28
00:00:47,041 --> 00:00:47,874
It was a box show.

29
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:49,290
Obviously it could have been a white show.

30
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:49,681
It was,

31
00:00:49,681 --> 00:00:51,300
I don't believe it was
anybody in the show.

32
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:55,380
I think it was just people in the audience
and there was a guy on a patio and

33
00:00:55,381 --> 00:00:56,070
uh,

34
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:59,640
obviously I have like
15 tanned information,

35
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:00,920
but uh,

36
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,810
there was story is that this guy just
walked right up to this guy and just shot

37
00:01:03,811 --> 00:01:05,250
him a bunch of times.

38
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:06,223
Yeah.

39
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:07,760
It's weird how,

40
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:08,420
uh,

41
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:12,520
I sent you that China did one of those
reenactments of it where it's just

42
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:17,330
commercials rather cdis and it's
really ridiculous how they show it.

43
00:01:17,331 --> 00:01:21,830
And so I've been showing it around cause
there's a lot of us are always there

44
00:01:21,831 --> 00:01:23,900
Tuesday nights and rose,

45
00:01:23,901 --> 00:01:26,000
the bartender was standing right there.

46
00:01:26,001 --> 00:01:26,451
She,

47
00:01:26,451 --> 00:01:26,781
you know,

48
00:01:26,781 --> 00:01:28,310
she helped afterwards.

49
00:01:28,311 --> 00:01:28,451
Why?

50
00:01:28,451 --> 00:01:29,440
By putting a,

51
00:01:29,441 --> 00:01:29,630
you know,

52
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:31,280
towels and stuff on the guy.

53
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:33,800
A lot of people at Francisco Ramos,

54
00:01:33,801 --> 00:01:35,960
which was standing right
next to Matt Edgar,

55
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:40,100
a lot of our friends were hanging out
on the patio because roast battle was

56
00:01:40,101 --> 00:01:41,630
going on and it's so,

57
00:01:41,631 --> 00:01:41,900
you know,

58
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:45,370
crowded for roast battle that a lot of
us just sit in the front patio and watch

59
00:01:45,371 --> 00:01:46,204
the Chinese.

60
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,660
It's a first of all note how
everyone's white at Daca.

61
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:51,543
Yeah.

62
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:52,750
So was it from there?

63
00:01:52,751 --> 00:01:54,370
While it does like the comedy store,

64
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:55,660
is that where it happened from?

65
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:56,181
You know,

66
00:01:56,181 --> 00:01:59,960
they're saying that what rose is saying
that this is not the side that came on.

67
00:01:59,961 --> 00:02:02,030
It was more right in the middle,

68
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:02,271
you know,

69
00:02:02,271 --> 00:02:03,104
the insurance.

70
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,333
Uh,

71
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:06,960
and was he that far away?

72
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,790
They're also saying he
ran across the street,

73
00:02:08,791 --> 00:02:12,990
which is another thing a lot of people
say that he got into a car and the car

74
00:02:12,991 --> 00:02:13,890
went down the street.

75
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,510
Other people were saying
he didn't get in the car.

76
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:17,940
And it's interesting because
there are so many people there,

77
00:02:17,941 --> 00:02:20,850
but yet they haven't
released anything about the,

78
00:02:20,851 --> 00:02:21,071
the,

79
00:02:21,071 --> 00:02:22,980
the shooter except that
he had a hoodie on,

80
00:02:22,981 --> 00:02:24,630
not like color of Hoodie Height,

81
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:25,141
nothing,

82
00:02:25,141 --> 00:02:26,010
which was odd,

83
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,330
you know.

84
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:27,770
Um,

85
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:29,010
but it happened so fast.

86
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:29,680
They say,

87
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,300
I don't know how those
things usually work.

88
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:35,050
I don't know if they give up all the
information like about the suspect.

89
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:36,940
The problem is if you,

90
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:39,160
if you tell people what it was like,

91
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:40,391
here's,

92
00:02:40,391 --> 00:02:40,781
here's a,

93
00:02:40,781 --> 00:02:43,630
this is a really weird thing that
happens when people see stuff,

94
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:46,000
the people see things,

95
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:48,760
and then the recollection
of what they actually saw.

96
00:02:48,761 --> 00:02:50,560
Oftentimes it's way off.

97
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:53,860
Like they've done these experiments
with people where they've,

98
00:02:53,861 --> 00:02:54,610
uh,

99
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:56,420
put them in stressful situations.

100
00:02:56,421 --> 00:02:57,790
It's like a fake bank robbery.

101
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,270
And then they ask them to
what happened and people,

102
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:04,840
they get it so wrong and they
think their head that it's right.

103
00:03:04,841 --> 00:03:05,021
I mean,

104
00:03:05,021 --> 00:03:07,390
I'm sure I've got some
memories in my head like that,

105
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:08,680
that are all fucked up.

106
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,390
And I'm sure you have some in your head.

107
00:03:10,391 --> 00:03:11,224
I just think,

108
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:13,660
I think what our memory,

109
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:14,250
we'd love,

110
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:17,590
we would like to think it's like some
stuff written down on paper or a video

111
00:03:17,591 --> 00:03:18,850
that you can watch and review.

112
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:19,661
But it's not,

113
00:03:19,661 --> 00:03:19,981
it's,

114
00:03:19,981 --> 00:03:21,040
it's fucking very,

115
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:22,151
very strange,

116
00:03:22,151 --> 00:03:26,290
especially when it comes to something
like a murder where someone steps out and

117
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:26,621
boom,

118
00:03:26,621 --> 00:03:27,454
just shoot somebody.

119
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:28,420
So if you say,

120
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:32,110
we're looking for a five foot
10 black male with a red Hoodie,

121
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:33,550
people going to find that guy.

122
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:34,481
They're gonna see it,

123
00:03:34,481 --> 00:03:35,890
they're gonna think it thinking that.

124
00:03:35,891 --> 00:03:40,891
But if you say we're looking for a five
foot 11 thin white male with a British

125
00:03:42,821 --> 00:03:43,654
accent,

126
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:44,651
then they'll say,

127
00:03:44,651 --> 00:03:45,461
I saw that guy.

128
00:03:45,461 --> 00:03:46,300
I know it was him.

129
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:49,660
There's going to be a certain
amount of people that will tell you,

130
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,570
even though they saw a
black guy in their head,

131
00:03:52,571 --> 00:03:55,900
they'll see that five foot
tall 11 English guy and the go,

132
00:03:55,901 --> 00:03:57,100
yes was,

133
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:59,700
I did think he was English
like in their head,

134
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:03,190
especially with like trauma
and the fear of the instance,

135
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:05,110
they are notoriously unreliable.

136
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:10,230
That's why like when scientists talk
about anecdotal evidence and evidence of

137
00:04:10,781 --> 00:04:11,740
people's experiences,

138
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,410
when you're trying to talk about
like paranormal shit especially,

139
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:15,790
so people say,

140
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:16,270
dude,

141
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:17,530
you can't tell me what I saw.

142
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:18,520
I know what I saw.

143
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:19,900
Do your really,

144
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,620
do you really know what you saw?

145
00:04:21,621 --> 00:04:23,380
Because I don't know what
I saw a lot of times,

146
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,470
like if you looked at my memory
just from like yesterday,

147
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:29,620
it's a blur of some snapshots,

148
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:29,921
you know?

149
00:04:29,921 --> 00:04:31,120
And I had a great day.

150
00:04:31,121 --> 00:04:36,121
I wasn't drunk hanging out with the
family but picked out some pumpkin's w saw

151
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:40,750
fucking pig race went to this
foreign place where they,

152
00:04:40,751 --> 00:04:41,021
you know,

153
00:04:41,021 --> 00:04:42,340
they let you pick out your own pumpkin.

154
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:43,120
It's fun.

155
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:43,781
It's a bunch of kids.

156
00:04:43,781 --> 00:04:44,171
It was cute.

157
00:04:44,171 --> 00:04:47,330
We had a good time wetting up corn maze,

158
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:47,621
you know.

159
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:48,330
But my,

160
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:49,001
my memory,

161
00:04:49,001 --> 00:04:51,670
my important thing is like totally sober,

162
00:04:51,671 --> 00:04:52,870
having a great time.

163
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:54,040
Lots of laughs.

164
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:55,150
But my memory like,

165
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:55,421
oh yeah,

166
00:04:55,421 --> 00:04:56,560
then we did that and then we did it.

167
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:57,550
Oh yeah we did that too.

168
00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:00,670
I had some that eh had
a sandwich and these,

169
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,920
these like this idea that,

170
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:03,300
you know,

171
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:04,720
we have this infallible memory.

172
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:07,800
I think when you start putting
out information like a,

173
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:10,360
this is what the guy definitely
looked like based on who?

174
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:11,223
Based on whose head,

175
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,550
who said it looks like that.

176
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:13,810
The people that saw the shooting.

177
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:14,920
Hmm.

178
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,191
Okay.

179
00:05:15,191 --> 00:05:16,600
If you don't have a photo,

180
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:17,050
you,

181
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:20,200
you better be real careful what you
say because these people that saw the

182
00:05:20,201 --> 00:05:20,591
shooting,

183
00:05:20,591 --> 00:05:20,831
man,

184
00:05:20,831 --> 00:05:21,664
boy,

185
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:24,100
I mean some of them might be good at it,

186
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:27,970
but we all know somebody who fucking
sucks at remembering stories.

187
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:28,391
You know,

188
00:05:28,391 --> 00:05:28,810
we all,

189
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:31,450
we all have that one person
that is terrible at it,

190
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,770
especially in a time of panic.

191
00:05:32,771 --> 00:05:34,210
I know when I got robbed,

192
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:37,300
I remember he had a fake beard and in,

193
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,141
but that's about it.

194
00:05:38,141 --> 00:05:39,130
Like I didn't like,

195
00:05:39,131 --> 00:05:39,970
I had some kind of coat,

196
00:05:39,971 --> 00:05:41,980
but I don't remember like
I was staring at him.

197
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:43,060
I should be able to know like,

198
00:05:43,061 --> 00:05:43,301
oh yeah,

199
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:44,560
he had a purple shirt on.

200
00:05:44,561 --> 00:05:44,861
He had it.

201
00:05:44,861 --> 00:05:45,694
You know,

202
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,580
isn't it funny that fake
beards are not allowed?

203
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:49,563
But

204
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,090
if you are a man and you wear a toupee,

205
00:05:52,091 --> 00:05:53,440
you can go through Tsa with it.

206
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:54,520
Oh yeah.

207
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,810
They'll leave that stupid
fake hair glued deer.

208
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:00,920
That's so strange.

209
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:03,250
But if you tried to go through
Tsa with a fake mustache,

210
00:06:03,251 --> 00:06:03,561
he'd be like,

211
00:06:03,561 --> 00:06:05,150
what the fuck are you trying to pull?

212
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:06,011
But if you,

213
00:06:06,011 --> 00:06:07,910
you can go in there with a mop up here.

214
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:11,330
I wonder how long your fake
hair can be before they go.

215
00:06:11,331 --> 00:06:11,661
Listen,

216
00:06:11,661 --> 00:06:13,250
you fuck take that thing off.

217
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:16,070
What could you go in there
with like a giant lion's mane?

218
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,061
Like if you,

219
00:06:17,061 --> 00:06:18,860
if you went in there with some crazy,

220
00:06:18,861 --> 00:06:23,510
if you were to stone called bald and
you went in there with a glued on Fabio

221
00:06:23,511 --> 00:06:23,871
wig,

222
00:06:23,871 --> 00:06:27,980
like a full Fabio that goes all the
way down to your ass or even crazier.

223
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:29,730
Like there was a dude that I was um,

224
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:33,700
I was at the House of Blues in
Houston a couple of weeks ago and uh,

225
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:34,220
it was great.

226
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:34,671
It was awesome.

227
00:06:34,671 --> 00:06:36,410
Meaning you Edwards and a,

228
00:06:36,411 --> 00:06:38,850
there was a dude has been
grown his hair for 14 years.

229
00:06:38,851 --> 00:06:39,684
It works here.

230
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:40,820
I've got a picture of homeboy,

231
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:42,770
he said a long ponytail.

232
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,170
Is that going?

233
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:43,461
No,

234
00:06:43,461 --> 00:06:43,900
no,

235
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:44,390
no.

236
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:46,080
He went the dreadlock routes.

237
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:51,560
It just takes one guy to have like tried
to put a bomb in his hair piece too.

238
00:06:51,561 --> 00:06:54,020
We have like a line where everyone
has to get there like two pays,

239
00:06:54,021 --> 00:06:55,640
like shoveled off or scraped.

240
00:06:55,641 --> 00:06:59,030
Well there's not enough people that have
big hair like that where you would have

241
00:06:59,031 --> 00:07:00,320
to like look into it.

242
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:01,161
But yeah,

243
00:07:01,161 --> 00:07:01,340
if,

244
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:01,760
if,

245
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,511
if people,

246
00:07:02,511 --> 00:07:04,550
if there was a lot of people running
around with a hair like that,

247
00:07:04,551 --> 00:07:05,810
they would start searching your hair.

248
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:09,800
I definitely 100% but those radio
wave things that they go through,

249
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:12,200
here's how I'm boy see his hair.

250
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:14,000
Holy Shit.

251
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:14,450
Yeah.

252
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:15,920
It goes all the way down to his ass.

253
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:17,120
His ass,

254
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:17,571
excuse me.

255
00:07:17,571 --> 00:07:18,830
Almost down to his knees.

256
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:20,150
That shit's got to smell.

257
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:21,220
It probably smells great.

258
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:22,910
Pockets of nest in there.

259
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:25,820
All kinds of living
are art forms in there.

260
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,760
Ebola spite.

261
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,840
The um,

262
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:31,550
wasn't going to say,

263
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:31,731
oh,

264
00:07:31,731 --> 00:07:32,564
but you keep,

265
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:34,070
if that was fake,

266
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:36,830
like there's no way you
could wear hair that long.

267
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:37,580
That's fig.

268
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:40,070
Cause now you weren't like some
crazy costume or something.

269
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:44,600
Like it has to be within the cultural
norm and has to be like culturally

270
00:07:44,601 --> 00:07:45,950
acceptable length hair.

271
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:46,920
You know,

272
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,280
like,

273
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,690
like do you remember when that Guy
Phil Spector was on trial for murder?

274
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:52,221
That really crazy.

275
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:53,600
Fuck Phil Spector,

276
00:07:53,601 --> 00:07:56,480
who Jamie probably knows who
he is more than both of us.

277
00:07:56,481 --> 00:07:57,314
Cause he was,

278
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:58,520
he had that thing,

279
00:07:58,521 --> 00:08:01,070
the wall of sound that
he had kind of created.

280
00:08:01,071 --> 00:08:03,680
He cranked kind of
created a new way of um,

281
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:04,190
uh,

282
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:05,300
producing music.

283
00:08:05,301 --> 00:08:05,870
Is that correct?

284
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:07,150
That the best way to describe it.

285
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:08,800
That's good.

286
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,320
Yeah.

287
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:12,380
But apparently he loved
putting guns in people's faces.

288
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:16,560
He was just a fucking nut
and he showed up for trial.

289
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,513
Look at that one.

290
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:22,540
Look at that wig like he showed up
for trial wherein the different wigs,

291
00:08:22,941 --> 00:08:23,241
right?

292
00:08:23,241 --> 00:08:24,800
Didn't you wear a couple different kinds?

293
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,070
He wore it.

294
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:27,283
Just that one.

295
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:27,921
No.

296
00:08:27,921 --> 00:08:28,720
What about that one?

297
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,270
Yeah.

298
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:30,680
So he's got two different wigs.

299
00:08:30,681 --> 00:08:31,514
At least.

300
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,470
What ended up happening to him?

301
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:33,980
Is he in jail?

302
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:34,581
Oh yeah.

303
00:08:34,581 --> 00:08:35,210
He's in jail.

304
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:36,230
He might be dead.

305
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:37,430
He might be dead now.

306
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:38,413
Look how,

307
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:39,170
yeah,

308
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:41,690
look how horrific he looks.

309
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:44,690
He just looks so creepy.

310
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,490
Is that him there smiling too?

311
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:48,710
While it looks like a totally
different person when he smiles.

312
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:50,750
That's so odd.

313
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:51,973
Oof.

314
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:53,390
He's a creepy dude.

315
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:54,110
Yeah.

316
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:54,351
Well,

317
00:08:54,351 --> 00:08:55,110
so he,

318
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:55,830
um,

319
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:58,050
he put a gun in some girl's mouth,

320
00:08:58,650 --> 00:08:58,981
you know,

321
00:08:58,981 --> 00:09:01,020
he was into that kind of shit like,

322
00:09:01,021 --> 00:09:01,321
bitch,

323
00:09:01,321 --> 00:09:02,100
I'll fucking kill you.

324
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,390
And he actually did kill her.

325
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:04,283
Wow.

326
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:05,123
And she was like a,

327
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:07,080
just a young lady.

328
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,200
I think that's her up there.

329
00:09:08,201 --> 00:09:09,270
Atlanta Clarkson.

330
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:09,991
That's her.

331
00:09:09,991 --> 00:09:10,500
Right.

332
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,460
She was really pretty,

333
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,660
oh shit.

334
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:16,350
That she had done some ma acting
and stuff and she met him.

335
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:21,420
What's amazing to me was not just that
he shot her and that this crazy fuck

336
00:09:21,421 --> 00:09:21,630
with,

337
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:25,050
but that an ugly dude like that can
bang a chick that looks that hot.

338
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:27,990
Like how did he get her?

339
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:28,840
Maybe,

340
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,510
maybe she wouldn't have sex with them.

341
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,880
Maybe that's why I shot her in the mouth.

342
00:09:32,881 --> 00:09:32,990
Well,

343
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:33,960
he's awesome millionaire,

344
00:09:33,961 --> 00:09:34,890
I think at that point,

345
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:36,090
you know?

346
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:36,540
Yeah,

347
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:36,811
no,

348
00:09:36,811 --> 00:09:37,920
that definitely has got to help.

349
00:09:37,921 --> 00:09:38,161
I mean,

350
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:38,380
it's,

351
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:40,950
but isn't an amazing
that it helps that much.

352
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:41,461
I mean,

353
00:09:41,461 --> 00:09:42,990
look how scary he is.

354
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:45,700
Is that Al Pachino?

355
00:09:45,701 --> 00:09:49,870
Did Al Chino play him
in a movie Hbo Movie?

356
00:09:49,871 --> 00:09:51,010
I think really?

357
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:52,340
What was it called?

358
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:55,083
No Shit.

359
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,320
I didn't know about that either.

360
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,370
There's too many movies.

361
00:09:59,371 --> 00:10:00,540
So it just caught Phil Spector.

362
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,570
Do you know I had a revelation the
other day when it came to movies.

363
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:04,500
Uh,

364
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,490
I went to see the Martian.

365
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:06,840
It was pretty good.

366
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:08,550
Interesting.

367
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:09,210
But it's,

368
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:10,043
problem is,

369
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:12,000
the problem with that movie is,

370
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:12,691
you know,

371
00:10:12,691 --> 00:10:13,524
he's going to live,

372
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:14,041
you know,

373
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:17,400
he's gonna make it so it's like someone
gave you a spoiler alert before you even

374
00:10:17,401 --> 00:10:18,234
got to the movie.

375
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:18,990
It's like,

376
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:19,321
oh,

377
00:10:19,321 --> 00:10:20,610
is he going to die on Mars?

378
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:24,270
Am I paying money to watch two hours
of him and he's going to die on Mars?

379
00:10:24,271 --> 00:10:25,051
Get the fuck Outta here.

380
00:10:25,051 --> 00:10:26,940
Everybody knows he's not
going to die on Mars.

381
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:30,960
But the revelation was there's,

382
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:35,280
there's too many movies and
like even really awesome movies,

383
00:10:35,281 --> 00:10:40,281
like sicario supposed to be pretty bad
ass because that's the new Benicio Del

384
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:41,011
Toro movie.

385
00:10:41,011 --> 00:10:42,000
It's supposed to be pretty bad ass,

386
00:10:42,001 --> 00:10:43,380
but we couldn't get a ticket to that one.

387
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:44,280
Um,

388
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,113
in time,

389
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,080
uh,

390
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:46,371
we,

391
00:10:46,371 --> 00:10:48,330
we were sold out so we
went with the Martian.

392
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:49,020
Um,

393
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:54,020
but the point is these movies never stop
every week there's new ones and they

394
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:55,590
don't go away.

395
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:59,790
Like the old ones don't stop being
around like you can go watch them too.

396
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:01,050
It's like there's too many of them.

397
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:05,760
Like I was thinking about
all the different movies
just on iTunes and Netflix

398
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,460
and I was scrolling through them and
I started thinking like this is an,

399
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:10,980
this is a never ending equation.

400
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:13,170
Like it just keeps getting tacked onto it.

401
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:16,350
We live in the epicenter
of where it's created.

402
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:18,480
It's all around here and it's,

403
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:22,260
it's very strange because the
body of work just never stops.

404
00:11:22,261 --> 00:11:24,570
Like he used to be when I was a kid.

405
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:26,760
When a good movie came out,

406
00:11:26,761 --> 00:11:28,410
you would go to see that fucking movie.

407
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,460
Like Star Wars.

408
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:34,670
I saw star wars 13 times and I was
nothing compared to the real geeks.

409
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:36,800
Like there's,

410
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,633
there was like,

411
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:41,580
it was a big deal back then to see
how many times you could see a movie.

412
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:46,020
Like you couldn't run a movie long enough
to see for someone to see it 13 times

413
00:11:46,021 --> 00:11:48,360
now because there's new ones,

414
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:50,070
there's new ones come in.

415
00:11:50,071 --> 00:11:52,350
We've got to get this fucking
piece of shit out of the theater.

416
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,070
You would never have a
movie like star wars.

417
00:11:54,071 --> 00:11:56,650
It played over and over and over
and over and over and over again.

418
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:59,110
And if star wars came out today,

419
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:01,900
people would shit right in its mouth.

420
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:03,850
It's,

421
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:04,750
it's weird.

422
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:05,770
That is to me,

423
00:12:05,771 --> 00:12:06,760
in my childhood,

424
00:12:06,761 --> 00:12:10,900
one of the greatest movies of all time
when I was a kid and that movie came out,

425
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:15,490
I remember when Obi wan Kenobi
was talking to Luke Skywalker and,

426
00:12:15,491 --> 00:12:15,551
uh,

427
00:12:15,551 --> 00:12:16,750
they were in the sand.

428
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:17,080
I was like,

429
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:20,410
this is the greatest thing
I've ever seen in my life.

430
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,820
This is amazing.

431
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,960
This guy's in space and he's gonna Obi
wan Kenobi is going to teach them how to

432
00:12:25,961 --> 00:12:26,621
be a jet.

433
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:27,040
I,

434
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:27,641
ah,

435
00:12:27,641 --> 00:12:28,920
this is the greatest wound we have.

436
00:12:28,921 --> 00:12:29,560
Our,

437
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,270
I remember it couldn't
have been more perfect.

438
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,920
I remember seeing that movie and thinking,

439
00:12:32,921 --> 00:12:34,870
this movie is fucking perfect.

440
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:36,550
Now you go watch and you're like,

441
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:37,241
oh my God,

442
00:12:37,241 --> 00:12:38,830
it's such a clunky Turd.

443
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,390
It's clunky.

444
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:42,340
The special effects look like shit.

445
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:43,680
Why is Darth Vader evil?

446
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:43,980
Does he,

447
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:45,760
does he just not even
a reason why he's evil?

448
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:46,750
He's just evil.

449
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:50,320
What does he get when he takes over the
world is even get pussy is even going to

450
00:12:50,321 --> 00:12:51,400
get any pussy in space.

451
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:55,480
He know he's just building some
giant star that can blow up planets.

452
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:56,463
Really?

453
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:57,700
This is so dumb.

454
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:58,810
Like it's so dumb.

455
00:12:58,900 --> 00:12:59,151
Oh,

456
00:12:59,151 --> 00:13:00,370
it uses the dark side.

457
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,121
Oh,

458
00:13:01,121 --> 00:13:02,110
not the dark side.

459
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:04,960
It's so fucking dumb and it's puppets.

460
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:08,410
It's like Kermit the frog
and the Skywalker in its day.

461
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,840
Like if you judge it in
the context of its day,

462
00:13:10,841 --> 00:13:12,940
it's one of the all time classic films.

463
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:14,291
It's just,

464
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:16,750
there's so many more
now and they're better.

465
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:21,310
There's some films from back then that
still like apocalypse now is a rock

466
00:13:21,311 --> 00:13:22,144
solid.

467
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:23,650
You try to go watch apocalypse now.

468
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,290
It is rock fucking solid.

469
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:29,920
Francis Ford Coppola
just made a masterpiece.

470
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:30,521
That's who did that,

471
00:13:30,521 --> 00:13:30,790
right?

472
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:31,121
It was him,

473
00:13:31,121 --> 00:13:31,954
right?

474
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:32,863
Yeah.

475
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:33,450
Some,

476
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:34,720
it's a masterpiece.

477
00:13:34,721 --> 00:13:35,740
It's a masterpiece.

478
00:13:35,741 --> 00:13:38,320
It's like a flaw was film
and it's a film that took,

479
00:13:38,321 --> 00:13:41,680
I think it took like seven
years to make and went way,

480
00:13:41,681 --> 00:13:42,670
way over budget.

481
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:46,750
They started with Laurence Fishburne
when he was like 17 years and in that

482
00:13:46,751 --> 00:13:47,584
movie,

483
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:49,930
I mean that was a crazy fucking movie,

484
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:51,040
but it's,

485
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:51,580
it's a,

486
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:52,870
it's a movie that holds up,

487
00:13:52,871 --> 00:13:53,260
man.

488
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:54,280
It still holds up.

489
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:55,983
Ghostbusters.

490
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:56,873
It doesn't hold up.

491
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,240
He doesn't hold up.

492
00:13:58,270 --> 00:13:59,920
There's a lot that happened
watching and going.

493
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:00,530
Ah,

494
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:01,060
we were,

495
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:01,960
we were kids though,

496
00:14:01,961 --> 00:14:02,620
right?

497
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:02,950
Yeah,

498
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:03,761
we were younger,

499
00:14:03,761 --> 00:14:04,320
but we were,

500
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,070
it was just looked real back then.

501
00:14:06,071 --> 00:14:07,740
That was like realistic too,

502
00:14:07,741 --> 00:14:08,260
is you know,

503
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:09,820
those monsters made out of clay.

504
00:14:09,821 --> 00:14:10,130
We're like,

505
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:10,480
oh my God,

506
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,740
it's a monster man out of clay.

507
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:14,410
I remember I used to
like land of the lost.

508
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:14,741
Ooh,

509
00:14:14,741 --> 00:14:15,870
the sleaze tax.

510
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:16,890
There are fun.

511
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:17,651
So cool.

512
00:14:17,651 --> 00:14:19,150
Look and Ooh,

513
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,073
excited.

514
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:22,300
Godzilla King Kong movie coming out.

515
00:14:22,301 --> 00:14:23,320
Oh Christ.

516
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:24,161
Here's why.

517
00:14:24,161 --> 00:14:24,994
That's stupid.

518
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:25,900
Okay.

519
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:27,730
Godzilla is 500 feet tall.

520
00:14:27,731 --> 00:14:29,140
King Kong's 50 feet tall.

521
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:30,490
Did you stop?

522
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,410
Does Japanese people fucked you?

523
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,980
They fucked you with those movies
because they violated all the laws.

524
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:40,750
They didn't give you some reason
why King Kong grew to 500.

525
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:43,210
He grew 450 extra fee.

526
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:44,440
They didn't say a word about it.

527
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:45,820
Come on man.

528
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:46,990
How's he so big?

529
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:47,580
He was,

530
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:48,070
he,

531
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:51,470
he used to be able to climb shit and he
would carry the chicken his hand and now

532
00:14:51,471 --> 00:14:53,060
all of a sudden he's as big as Godzilla.

533
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,610
What if it was baby
Godzilla versus King Kong?

534
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:57,230
Like it was just baby Godzilla.

535
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:58,163
He was small.

536
00:14:58,190 --> 00:14:59,930
Don't make a little bit more sense.

537
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:00,380
Right?

538
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:02,090
But he would just stand
back and light them on fire.

539
00:15:02,091 --> 00:15:03,050
It's fucking stupid.

540
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,540
Fight will take 30 seconds.

541
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:06,111
I mean,

542
00:15:06,111 --> 00:15:08,000
to get killed by little tiny airplanes.

543
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:09,650
He got killed by airplanes.

544
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:13,370
And if you know anything
about like firepower and guns,

545
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:18,550
the idea that you could kill a gorilla
with these little piss ant bullets from

546
00:15:18,621 --> 00:15:18,771
a,

547
00:15:18,771 --> 00:15:19,310
um,

548
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:19,580
a,

549
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:21,790
a tiny little stupid cardboard plane.

550
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:27,050
There's there that you're killing a
gorilla that's so fucking big that it can

551
00:15:27,831 --> 00:15:30,800
carry people and climbed to the
top of the empire state building.

552
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:34,820
He can grab planes out of
the air and smashed them.

553
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:35,960
Remember it was doing that,

554
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:38,810
but yet those little baby
bullets are killing them.

555
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:43,220
Those little baby bolts would just make
him furious unless they were like the

556
00:15:43,221 --> 00:15:46,010
hollow points or something like that
where they blew up inside of him.

557
00:15:46,011 --> 00:15:46,844
It doesn't matter.

558
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:48,470
Unless they were cannons,

559
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,333
they would have to be like,

560
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:54,080
they don't have to be such of a such a
high caliber that it would be like boom,

561
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:55,133
boom.

562
00:15:55,210 --> 00:15:57,470
They would be mad fucking recoil.

563
00:15:57,471 --> 00:15:58,780
It would be me.

564
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:00,740
Especially back then they figured it.

565
00:16:00,741 --> 00:16:01,820
They have guns now that I have,

566
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:03,100
they're like a,

567
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:06,410
Donald's Serone had one that he
put a video of it on his Instagram.

568
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:06,861
It's,

569
00:16:06,861 --> 00:16:09,260
I think they call it
integrally suppressed,

570
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:11,090
so when you fire the gun,

571
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,830
it's a 300 win mag,

572
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:14,900
which is a big round.

573
00:16:14,901 --> 00:16:16,520
It's a very powerful rifle.

574
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:17,271
When you fired,

575
00:16:17,271 --> 00:16:19,430
it's like Tunc Tunc like nothing.

576
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:21,320
You don't feel anything and
you don't hear anything.

577
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:24,680
It's like a very small amount of
sound and a very small amount of kick.

578
00:16:24,681 --> 00:16:24,831
Like,

579
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:26,870
he has a girl on his Instagram picture,

580
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:30,770
just a regular sized girl shooting it
and it's not fucking her up at all,

581
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:33,170
but it should be like at least a struggle,

582
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:34,160
you know,

583
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:34,580
so,

584
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:37,370
but back then they didn't have
any of that shit back then.

585
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:40,760
It was just like an explosion and the
metal tube shooting out a piece of lead.

586
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:44,900
The idea that you're going to kill this
big gorilla with your piss ass guns.

587
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:46,970
He's going to fuck you up man.

588
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:48,290
And he's going to bang that white chick.

589
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:49,431
That's what he's there for.

590
00:16:49,431 --> 00:16:49,601
And it's,

591
00:16:49,601 --> 00:16:50,850
they got smart and you know,

592
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:53,960
it was just all like hacking
and like nuclear war.

593
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:56,510
Like God's Zelle is using
computers now and King Kong.

594
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,333
Nevermind.

595
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:01,100
Where were you going with that?

596
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:02,930
You committed to it too.

597
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:06,380
It made it a drama drama.

598
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:07,581
Well,

599
00:17:07,581 --> 00:17:07,741
the,

600
00:17:07,741 --> 00:17:08,660
the last God,

601
00:17:08,661 --> 00:17:11,360
Zillow looked like it
was going to be bad ass.

602
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:12,583
I never watched it.

603
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:13,543
It wasn't good.

604
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,290
It was kind of fun.

605
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:16,171
Like a,

606
00:17:16,171 --> 00:17:20,540
the Godzilla monster
itself was fucking Badass.

607
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,820
Like they did an amazing job with CGI,

608
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:23,931
but the,

609
00:17:23,931 --> 00:17:24,560
um,

610
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:29,560
the story was so clunky and this fucking
kid who's the hero keeps surviving.

611
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:30,981
I mean,

612
00:17:30,981 --> 00:17:32,540
he survived the most ridiculous shit.

613
00:17:32,541 --> 00:17:37,250
Like a plane fell off a or a train fell
off of a giant bridge into the water and

614
00:17:37,251 --> 00:17:39,680
he gets out of there like
over and over and over again.

615
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:40,580
It wasn't that what happened,

616
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:43,820
some stupid shit like that
over and over and over again.

617
00:17:43,821 --> 00:17:46,100
This fuck survives the most ridiculous,

618
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:50,040
preposterous disaster scenarios
to watch Godzilla kill

619
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:50,611
this bad guy.

620
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:51,840
And the spoiler alert,

621
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:54,450
Godzilla survives spoiler.

622
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:58,620
But it's just the special
effects were pretty wicked.

623
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:01,740
But the story itself was just clunky.

624
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:03,900
Did you see a movie called the guest?

625
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:05,580
I don't think so.

626
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:06,413
Who's in it?

627
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:07,100
Uh,

628
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,240
I forget his name.

629
00:18:08,241 --> 00:18:08,920
I was not,

630
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,070
no one really.

631
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:10,371
Hold on.

632
00:18:10,371 --> 00:18:11,090
I'll tell you right now.

633
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:11,923
It is,

634
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:12,740
uh,

635
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:13,760
add no,

636
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,150
Dan Stevens,

637
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:18,500
I don't know that is.

638
00:18:18,501 --> 00:18:18,981
Anyways,

639
00:18:18,981 --> 00:18:21,020
it got really good on rotten tomatoes.

640
00:18:21,021 --> 00:18:22,670
I got like 92%.

641
00:18:22,671 --> 00:18:22,971
You know,

642
00:18:22,971 --> 00:18:24,200
like it got really good reviews.

643
00:18:24,201 --> 00:18:25,820
Doug Benson told me to watch it.

644
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:27,590
It's on Netflix right now.

645
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,880
It starts off like a kid's like,

646
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:32,540
like kids like summer
or you spoiler alert.

647
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:33,090
No,

648
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:33,890
not,

649
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:34,401
it's like,

650
00:18:34,401 --> 00:18:35,151
it starts off this,

651
00:18:35,151 --> 00:18:35,720
uh,

652
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,320
uh,

653
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,150
like a kid summer teen movie,

654
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:38,631
right?

655
00:18:38,631 --> 00:18:39,500
And this guy,

656
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:40,040
uh,

657
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,520
who just got out of the army comes visits.

658
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:47,540
This family is one of the biggest
road house type version movie.

659
00:18:48,321 --> 00:18:49,610
It starts off horrible,

660
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,920
but then you wake up out of this coma,

661
00:18:51,921 --> 00:18:52,131
you're like,

662
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:52,341
wait,

663
00:18:52,341 --> 00:18:53,750
what the fuck am I watching?

664
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:54,960
And then it started like,

665
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:55,791
I swear to God,

666
00:18:55,791 --> 00:18:57,620
I laughed so hard in this movie,

667
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:58,371
like a cut,

668
00:18:58,371 --> 00:19:00,200
like a roadhouse accidentally.

669
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,330
But then I go to Doug and I'm like,

670
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:02,961
dude,

671
00:19:02,961 --> 00:19:04,040
thank you so much.

672
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:05,900
That was like holy various movie.

673
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:06,470
And he goes,

674
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:07,660
oh well you like,

675
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:09,650
he liked it for real disease.

676
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:10,543
You know,

677
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:15,080
Doug Benson quite possibly might be
the worst poster boy for wheat alive.

678
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,400
I just did is getting Doug with high.

679
00:19:19,401 --> 00:19:22,970
And he would like ask a question and
then I'd be like starting to answer.

680
00:19:22,971 --> 00:19:23,241
And he goes,

681
00:19:23,241 --> 00:19:23,450
oh,

682
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:24,180
what are you talking about?

683
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:26,830
Like took completely forgot what it,

684
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:29,750
well in his defense,

685
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,250
listen to what you just said.

686
00:19:31,251 --> 00:19:32,061
30 seconds go.

687
00:19:32,061 --> 00:19:35,660
Well Godzilla hacking computers guide.

688
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,920
Zillow was like a drama.

689
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:38,630
Like if they like it made it a drama.

690
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:41,840
King Kong was hacking
Godzilla and made it like a,

691
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:46,260
what was that picture of view?

692
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:47,490
But this uh,

693
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:50,760
this idea that Doug Benson
smokes too much pot.

694
00:19:50,761 --> 00:19:54,960
We should explore this cause I know he
enjoys the marijuana and I know he's been

695
00:19:54,961 --> 00:19:55,410
a,

696
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:57,930
an activist and letting people know,

697
00:19:57,931 --> 00:20:01,650
but this type of behavior is
perhaps negative to the cause.

698
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:06,070
He makes me a not so high.

699
00:20:06,071 --> 00:20:06,904
It's so funny.

700
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:09,940
It's so high all the time
and he gets visually high,

701
00:20:09,941 --> 00:20:13,780
which makes it so much more fun
when it closes up like razor slits,

702
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,060
he closes up like there's no ice in there.

703
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:16,931
Where's your eyes,

704
00:20:16,931 --> 00:20:17,320
man?

705
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,400
It's like you don't have any eyes.

706
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:18,611
Dot.

707
00:20:18,611 --> 00:20:20,500
Merera if he was a pirate or something,

708
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:22,241
I smoke pot.

709
00:20:22,241 --> 00:20:23,170
We have to get them a cane.

710
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:26,200
We'd have to get them
with those Wa blind canes.

711
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:27,490
You have to give them a dog.

712
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:32,020
That Ebola thing about the eyes though,

713
00:20:32,021 --> 00:20:33,310
that really freaked me out.

714
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:34,210
I should,

715
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:37,030
how should it bullet has
been living in people's eyes.

716
00:20:37,031 --> 00:20:38,890
The guys that had a Bullock spitting,

717
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:39,880
staying in his eyes,

718
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:41,830
changing their eye colors from green,

719
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:43,450
blue and getting,

720
00:20:43,451 --> 00:20:46,900
having blurry vision and then when he
gets to checked his eyes are not as

721
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:47,980
anymore than more

722
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:51,520
of like a most sure mushier
version of this sugar and more.

723
00:20:51,521 --> 00:20:51,910
Sure.

724
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:52,301
Yeah.

725
00:20:52,301 --> 00:20:54,430
They said that it actually was a,

726
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:57,100
it was affecting the structure of his eye.

727
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:57,850
Yeah.

728
00:20:57,850 --> 00:20:58,670
Fuck.

729
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:00,760
And what's weird is when
I went to my eye doctor,

730
00:21:00,761 --> 00:21:04,690
they said my eye structure was fucked
and I had scarring in the back for some

731
00:21:04,691 --> 00:21:05,111
reason.

732
00:21:05,111 --> 00:21:08,170
And you don't have a bowl
of dude so much skinnier.

733
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:09,280
You think,

734
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:09,500
yeah,

735
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,810
they lose a shit load of weight.

736
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,280
Well what if I just have my shit?

737
00:21:12,281 --> 00:21:16,740
The brains out a lazy version of our
sleeping or maybe you look a survivor,

738
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:17,860
you one of those carriers,

739
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:19,750
like there's some girls
that can give you herpes,

740
00:21:19,751 --> 00:21:21,370
but they don't show any signs of herpes.

741
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,313
Right.

742
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:24,370
This guy right here,

743
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:25,210
he girls notice.

744
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:26,710
I blame it all on the girls.

745
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:27,611
Well,

746
00:21:27,611 --> 00:21:29,880
when did the symptoms is blurry vision.

747
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:31,510
He started tripping out and stuff.

748
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:33,400
What I've been trying to deal with myself,

749
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:34,010
uh,

750
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:35,430
I don't think you,

751
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:36,180
you,

752
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:37,120
you have to be,

753
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,970
you have to consider a couple things
when you're talking about your eyes.

754
00:21:39,971 --> 00:21:41,650
You definitely don't have
to think about Ebola,

755
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:44,500
but you do have to think about
taking care of your health.

756
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:46,510
You don't take care of your health.

757
00:21:46,511 --> 00:21:47,321
And I've told you before,

758
00:21:47,321 --> 00:21:48,310
it freaks me out.

759
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:48,581
Well,

760
00:21:48,581 --> 00:21:51,220
I've cut out things like
boner pills recently and,

761
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:51,560
well,

762
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,900
you definitely should cut out those.

763
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:53,261
Look,

764
00:21:53,261 --> 00:21:55,960
they have Viagra and
Cialis and stuff like that.

765
00:21:55,961 --> 00:21:58,270
And it's like scientifically proven.

766
00:21:58,290 --> 00:21:58,451
You,

767
00:21:58,451 --> 00:22:00,280
you can adjust your dosage.

768
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:02,890
You don't know what you're taking
when you take those things.

769
00:22:02,891 --> 00:22:04,750
And a lot of times you
aren't taking Cialis.

770
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:06,340
You are taking Viagra.

771
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:06,591
What,

772
00:22:06,591 --> 00:22:08,870
what's weird is Lamar
Odom who just recently,

773
00:22:08,871 --> 00:22:09,270
you know,

774
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:11,300
I went to the hospital for a,

775
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,590
they found him at the bunny ranch.

776
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:16,570
She had sits like supposedly
cocaine around and uh,

777
00:22:16,571 --> 00:22:17,290
these,

778
00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:18,130
these boner pills,

779
00:22:18,131 --> 00:22:18,791
he's gas station,

780
00:22:18,791 --> 00:22:19,624
boner pills.

781
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:20,040
Uh,

782
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,250
what's so weird about the whole thing,

783
00:22:21,251 --> 00:22:22,660
about two days before that happened,

784
00:22:22,661 --> 00:22:25,600
I found out they fda.gov
Gov on their front page,

785
00:22:25,601 --> 00:22:26,470
if you go to it right now,

786
00:22:26,471 --> 00:22:28,780
has a whole thing about these boner pills.

787
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:33,280
And they also have links to every
single like boner pill that you can buy.

788
00:22:33,281 --> 00:22:34,720
Like I took all my wrap,

789
00:22:34,721 --> 00:22:35,920
I keep my rappers like,

790
00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:37,631
cause they come in and he's like,

791
00:22:37,631 --> 00:22:39,750
cardboard saved them like baseball cards.

792
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:42,520
They're cool because they all have
really good artwork and you know,

793
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:43,930
so they need good artwork.

794
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:48,460
It's just like David chose were
the Mona Lisa on those things,

795
00:22:48,461 --> 00:22:48,820
man.

796
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:50,620
So I looked at my favorite one.

797
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,870
My favorite one has viagara in it,

798
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:54,700
the Mexican version of Viagra in it.

799
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:57,100
But a lot of them also have steroids.

800
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:57,431
And um,

801
00:22:57,431 --> 00:22:58,510
and if you can go through this,

802
00:22:58,511 --> 00:23:00,010
like this is the hidden agreement.

803
00:23:00,011 --> 00:23:01,630
Like a lot of them are steroids,

804
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:04,750
a generic names for Viagra.

805
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:05,051
Well,

806
00:23:05,051 --> 00:23:05,321
you know,

807
00:23:05,321 --> 00:23:08,650
that was Anderson Silva's excuse
when he tested positive for steroids.

808
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:09,960
That makes totally sense.

809
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:13,090
He took a Chinese Viagra and,

810
00:23:13,091 --> 00:23:14,440
but what they think is,

811
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:16,300
this is actually one way,

812
00:23:16,301 --> 00:23:17,610
it could be what,

813
00:23:17,611 --> 00:23:18,161
what had happened,

814
00:23:18,161 --> 00:23:18,521
what he said,

815
00:23:18,521 --> 00:23:21,050
could it be true that he
might've gotten some sort of a,

816
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:22,300
it might've called it Viagara,

817
00:23:22,301 --> 00:23:25,390
but it might've been like
some super strong boner pill
that also has steroids in

818
00:23:25,391 --> 00:23:26,080
it.

819
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:26,913
But the other,

820
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:32,200
what they were thinking is that with a
company that makes this Viagra or Cialis

821
00:23:32,201 --> 00:23:32,531
or whatever,

822
00:23:32,531 --> 00:23:36,040
it was also make steroids and they just
didn't clean their batch and some of it

823
00:23:36,041 --> 00:23:36,910
got contaminated,

824
00:23:36,911 --> 00:23:37,990
which does happen.

825
00:23:38,170 --> 00:23:39,130
We've actually,

826
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:39,880
um,

827
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:40,271
we've,

828
00:23:40,271 --> 00:23:43,330
we've run tests on different
supplements that we have like,

829
00:23:43,331 --> 00:23:43,840
um,

830
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:44,890
a Alpha brain.

831
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,360
And during the early days

832
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,100
when we first started doing it,

833
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:54,380
we would notice that there would
be a certain inconsistency in,

834
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:55,010
um,

835
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:57,050
in like the amount of something.

836
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:00,470
It was just like minor,

837
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,610
but enough to we'll guy.

838
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:02,240
Hmm.

839
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,220
And then occasionally
we would find something,

840
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,150
um,

841
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:06,080
in a supplement.

842
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:07,330
Like we never found it in,

843
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:09,890
in a alpha brain or true
mood or something like that.

844
00:24:09,891 --> 00:24:11,510
But I know they've found it in like,

845
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:14,870
well you get like a B 12 supplement
and it has vitamin A in it.

846
00:24:14,871 --> 00:24:15,980
For some reason it never was like,

847
00:24:15,981 --> 00:24:16,940
well how'd that get in there?

848
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:17,600
Or You have,

849
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,540
cause you're getting your
stuff from like bulk.

850
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:23,570
You're getting it from a lot of people
are getting with if they're getting like

851
00:24:23,571 --> 00:24:25,430
Tribulus I know used to buy that stuff.

852
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:26,030
Right.

853
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:27,310
Well if you're getting vitamins you,

854
00:24:27,311 --> 00:24:29,020
you're getting them from
these bulk supplies.

855
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:32,000
Like my friend Larry used to run that
vitamin company and when you get stuff

856
00:24:32,001 --> 00:24:33,320
from bulk suppliers,

857
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,960
like a lot of times they,

858
00:24:34,961 --> 00:24:39,200
they're mixing their stuff in these
vats and they just don't clean them.

859
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:40,700
They do a shitty job of cleaning them.

860
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:42,920
Most of the time you're okay.

861
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:44,120
But if,

862
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:47,050
if someone fucks up and
doesn't do their job or you,

863
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:50,750
you deal with some low level company
that doesn't take care of their shit,

864
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,250
you definitely,

865
00:24:52,251 --> 00:24:52,791
definitely,

866
00:24:52,791 --> 00:24:57,230
definitely can get steroids and things
along those lines inside like protein

867
00:24:57,231 --> 00:24:58,590
powders and insides,

868
00:24:58,970 --> 00:24:59,870
muscle supplements.

869
00:24:59,871 --> 00:25:00,704
They shouldn't be there.

870
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:02,990
But then there's also some of them,

871
00:25:02,991 --> 00:25:04,610
they just put steroids in there.

872
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,270
You know why?

873
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:09,920
Because steroids work so and you can
get cheap Chinese steroids and you just

874
00:25:09,921 --> 00:25:13,040
throw them in your boner pills and
you'll let want to fuck like a gorilla.

875
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:14,780
Cause cause you're juiced up man,

876
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:18,530
you actually on steroids and
it will fuck with your mood.

877
00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:20,720
We had that Jeff Novitsky Guy,

878
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:24,920
he's the guy who works for the u s
antidoping agency and he's the guy busted

879
00:25:24,921 --> 00:25:28,190
Lance Armstrong and now he
works for the UFC and he's,

880
00:25:28,191 --> 00:25:28,610
you know,

881
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:30,710
doing all these crazy random drug test.

882
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:35,840
He told us about all the
different substances that
the Olympic Committee and the

883
00:25:35,841 --> 00:25:39,200
FDA finds out test positive for steroids.

884
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,820
And we're like well how many are there?

885
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:42,440
So we go to the fucking website,

886
00:25:42,441 --> 00:25:44,390
there's a website where
it lists each one of them.

887
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,670
We didn't even get through the Aes,

888
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:50,750
we were in the A's and there was
hundreds of them that are just steroids.

889
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:52,670
So when you're going into the the,

890
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:53,723
you know,

891
00:25:54,530 --> 00:25:56,960
local vitamin Shoppe and you're seeing,

892
00:25:56,961 --> 00:25:57,121
you know,

893
00:25:57,121 --> 00:26:00,680
muscle build 5,000 some
fucking guys shred it on it.

894
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,780
A lot of those are steroids,

895
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:07,820
especially more so back in the day
than today because they're a little bit

896
00:26:07,821 --> 00:26:11,000
better at busting people and there's a
little bit less people that are willing

897
00:26:11,001 --> 00:26:15,200
to take the chance of getting arrested
or of getting sued or whatever.

898
00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:17,660
But there's a lot of
that shit that's just,

899
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:21,830
there's so much monkey business involved
and like those kind of like muscle

900
00:26:21,831 --> 00:26:22,670
building things

901
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:28,010
at whether it's really dangerous because
all the ones I had were on the fda.gov

902
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:28,611
and I,

903
00:26:28,611 --> 00:26:32,030
and so then I started taking each one
of the boner pills and showing like

904
00:26:32,031 --> 00:26:34,520
looking at every single
ingredient that was in it.

905
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:39,680
A lot of them were roots and like
mixing certain things with other things.

906
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:41,450
Have net has never been tested.

907
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:42,530
And uh,

908
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:44,310
like if you have low blood pressure,

909
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:46,710
you could die off these
boner pills just from,

910
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:49,760
of you have a heart if
you're on a heart medication.

911
00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:50,130
Yes.

912
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:51,970
Like old dudes that have um,

913
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:52,620
uh,

914
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:53,131
heart attacks.

915
00:26:53,131 --> 00:26:56,010
They have to take nitrates like
nitroglycerine and stuff like that.

916
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:56,581
If you,

917
00:26:56,581 --> 00:26:58,620
if you take that like you ever
seen those in those movies,

918
00:26:58,621 --> 00:27:00,270
the guy would almost be
about to take a hard time.

919
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:02,100
Then he popped those little
pills and chew them up.

920
00:27:02,101 --> 00:27:03,390
He's got to get to my heart pills.

921
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:04,081
You remember that?

922
00:27:04,081 --> 00:27:04,920
Oh yeah.

923
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:06,240
It was always in those movies.

924
00:27:06,241 --> 00:27:06,461
Remember?

925
00:27:06,461 --> 00:27:07,060
That's real.

926
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:07,510
Yeah.

927
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:07,990
Yeah.

928
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:08,670
That's real.

929
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:09,510
There are um,

930
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:10,230
certain,

931
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:10,411
uh,

932
00:27:10,411 --> 00:27:11,610
I think it's Nitroglycerin,

933
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:17,450
but certain things that you take that
if you are on those and then you take

934
00:27:17,671 --> 00:27:18,241
Viagra,

935
00:27:18,241 --> 00:27:20,280
it can be super fucking dangerous for you.

936
00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:24,600
So these people are just taking them
thinking that what's on that label is

937
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:25,590
what's actually in it.

938
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,240
A lot of times that's not the case.

939
00:27:27,241 --> 00:27:27,781
A lot of times.

940
00:27:27,781 --> 00:27:29,100
Just a bunch of extra shit in there.

941
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:29,760
Uh,

942
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,680
the one that I recently have been taking,

943
00:27:31,681 --> 00:27:32,590
it's had,

944
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:34,740
I ended up having a fire in it,

945
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:36,450
but they had a new formula version,

946
00:27:36,451 --> 00:27:38,520
which the FDA hasn't tried yet.

947
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:40,560
But the new form live
version works really good,

948
00:27:40,561 --> 00:27:42,100
like way better than the old stuff that,

949
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:43,750
but I think that has whatever's in,

950
00:27:43,751 --> 00:27:44,730
it's making me trip.

951
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:45,850
Yeah,

952
00:27:45,850 --> 00:27:47,490
it's probably super bad for you.

953
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,920
It's probably some crazy stimulants.

954
00:27:49,921 --> 00:27:50,620
And who,

955
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:51,241
who knows,

956
00:27:51,241 --> 00:27:51,830
man,

957
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:55,380
you got to buy stuff from
reputable sources like this.

958
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:59,850
That's one thing that I disagree with
people when they want to have total

959
00:27:59,851 --> 00:28:02,910
deregulation of drugs and and things like,

960
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:03,600
man,

961
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:08,340
you gotta be careful of people that are
just going to sell you some shit and

962
00:28:08,341 --> 00:28:09,360
tell you it's one thing.

963
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,620
But it's actually something else.

964
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:16,010
Like there should be some form of
regulation when it comes to things like,

965
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:18,050
Eh,

966
00:28:18,050 --> 00:28:18,390
you know,

967
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:22,770
anything that's got something in it that
could be dangerous where it's like a

968
00:28:22,771 --> 00:28:25,800
stimulant or metals rip fuel type things.

969
00:28:25,801 --> 00:28:27,360
It turned out to kill a bunch of people.

970
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:28,493
Like you should.

971
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:29,671
We should,

972
00:28:29,671 --> 00:28:33,750
there should be some accountability and
there also should be someone checking on

973
00:28:33,751 --> 00:28:34,560
that stuff.

974
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:39,560
Like you kind of need someone checking
to make sure that you're not gonna like

975
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:43,890
inadvertently give someone who thinks
they're just going to get some herbal,

976
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:44,790
you know,

977
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:46,320
testosterone booster,

978
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,570
you're actually going to give
him steroids and Viagara,

979
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:48,960
you know,

980
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:49,980
she'd be GNC.

981
00:28:49,981 --> 00:28:50,581
Why didn't you say,

982
00:28:50,581 --> 00:28:50,791
I mean,

983
00:28:50,791 --> 00:28:52,680
I bought rip fuel when
I was in high school.

984
00:28:52,681 --> 00:28:54,480
We used to all get on that shit.

985
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:57,150
Nice school people died from that stuff.

986
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:57,660
Yeah,

987
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:58,440
definitely.

988
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:00,840
That's why a federal like you
can't get that shit anymore.

989
00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:03,240
People used to just buy a federal
used to be able to buy that.

990
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:04,930
That's uh,

991
00:29:04,930 --> 00:29:07,260
it's fucking stimulant
and the hardcore one too.

992
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:09,570
And it just jacks your heart rate up man.

993
00:29:09,571 --> 00:29:14,571
Like my good buddy used to drink that
red line stuff everyday in the gym five

994
00:29:15,151 --> 00:29:17,760
times a week and he's drinking
red bull four times a day anyway.

995
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:20,550
But he's lucky.

996
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:22,080
He's lucky he's alive.

997
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:23,540
Okay.

998
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:23,771
I,

999
00:29:23,771 --> 00:29:24,010
uh,

1000
00:29:24,010 --> 00:29:27,540
I took rip fuel once before Jujitsu and
I literally thought I was going to have

1001
00:29:27,541 --> 00:29:28,320
a heart attack.

1002
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,600
It didn't make any sense why
my heart was beating so fast.

1003
00:29:30,601 --> 00:29:31,050
I was like,

1004
00:29:31,050 --> 00:29:33,000
I know I was working
out and I know it was,

1005
00:29:33,001 --> 00:29:33,390
you know,

1006
00:29:33,390 --> 00:29:34,290
exerting myself,

1007
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:34,921
but I was like,

1008
00:29:34,921 --> 00:29:36,960
but this is just some next level shit.

1009
00:29:36,961 --> 00:29:38,130
Like I have to stop.

1010
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,310
Like I can't do it.

1011
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:39,450
Like,

1012
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:41,620
I literally couldn't work out
after a certain and I was like,

1013
00:29:41,621 --> 00:29:42,880
my heart's beating too fast.

1014
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:43,863
It was weird.

1015
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:45,340
It's like your heart's beating too fast,

1016
00:29:45,341 --> 00:29:46,810
but you're not that tired.

1017
00:29:46,811 --> 00:29:47,410
It's like,

1018
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:48,040
it's just,

1019
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,990
your body's just weird and out on you.

1020
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:50,920
It's just like,

1021
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,120
what's all this extra shit

1022
00:29:55,870 --> 00:29:57,250
and used to be able to get it everywhere.

1023
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:57,960
Yeah.

1024
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,170
And it's a lot of that stuff,

1025
00:29:59,171 --> 00:29:59,670
man.

1026
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:00,490
Lot of that stuff.

1027
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:01,720
And how they even like,

1028
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:06,040
that's what you said from my experience
of being involved with on it and the

1029
00:30:06,041 --> 00:30:07,180
creation of Alpha brain.

1030
00:30:07,181 --> 00:30:08,330
And when you find,

1031
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:08,530
you know,

1032
00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:11,560
you find out your suppliers
aren't doing the right thing,

1033
00:30:11,561 --> 00:30:15,060
you find out that like you got to
make sure that people are like,

1034
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:18,550
you have to test things and double
things every step of the way.

1035
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:21,150
And when you're running
a company like GNC,

1036
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:22,030
Jesus Christ,

1037
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,980
how many products they
have on their shelves,

1038
00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:28,270
she live aisles and aisles
and the hundreds of fucking
things from hundreds of

1039
00:30:28,271 --> 00:30:29,080
different companies.

1040
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:34,080
And all of them are broadening weight
loss and it's mental clarity and fitness,

1041
00:30:34,961 --> 00:30:35,210
uh,

1042
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:36,430
it enhancement and,

1043
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,451
and you know,

1044
00:30:37,451 --> 00:30:41,050
muscle gains in strength gains and size.

1045
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:42,970
You're going to put on weight and like,

1046
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:43,840

he sure is all this stuff legit.

1048
00:30:46,810 --> 00:30:47,650
They don't know.

1049
00:30:48,010 --> 00:30:49,000
They don't give a fuck.

1050
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:49,800
They just go,

1051
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:49,980
go,

1052
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:50,530

1053
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:52,360
What do you gotta you got Dick
Pills to bring them in here,

1054
00:30:52,361 --> 00:30:53,170
bitch.

1055
00:30:53,170 --> 00:30:53,860
You know,

1056
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:54,693
and if you bought,

1057
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:58,270
if you went to a store
and you got some um,

1058
00:30:58,570 --> 00:31:00,520
some testosterone booster,

1059
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:00,941
you know,

1060
00:31:00,941 --> 00:31:01,520
it says,

1061
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:01,840

1065
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:07,390

00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:07,990

1069
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:14,800
And it would psychologically
make you feel like,

1070
00:31:14,801 --> 00:31:15,251

1073
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:19,450
You would just go start buying it.

1074
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:20,710
Like for guys,

1075
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:24,550
you give a guy something that makes his
dick hard and they're going to think

1076
00:31:24,551 --> 00:31:25,990
that they found the fucking thing.

1077
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,520
They found the fountain of Youth.

1078
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:28,983
It found it.

1079
00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:31,480
They found that they found the holy grail

1080
00:31:31,870 --> 00:31:33,950
just makes it thicker and longer.

1081
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,120
It's not even hard.

1082
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:35,780
Right.

1083
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:36,650
What the news,

1084
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:39,380
these kinds or like a
swelling of the Dick Martin.

1085
00:31:39,381 --> 00:31:40,190
What kinds?

1086
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:44,060
Like these generic kinds with all this
extra stuff and they can know what you're

1087
00:31:44,061 --> 00:31:44,391
taking.

1088
00:31:44,391 --> 00:31:45,530
Will you take one if I give,

1089
00:31:45,531 --> 00:31:46,830
you know,

1090
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:51,380
I would have to have a scientist go
over that shit with a fine tooth comb.

1091
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:53,060
Who knows what's in those things,

1092
00:31:53,061 --> 00:31:53,410
man,

1093
00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:55,130
don't you don't even
know who's making them.

1094
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:58,730
I know fucking spray paint artwork
and you like look at the artwork.

1095
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:00,290
I'm definitely putting this in my body.

1096
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,120
I hope it doesn't do any permanent damage.

1097
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:02,550
Gee,

1098
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:04,700
why is my eyesight
going off fucking wanky?

1099
00:32:05,150 --> 00:32:07,070
You're seeing things wiggle
in front of your eyes,

1100
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:09,070
eh?

1101
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:09,610
Also,

1102
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:11,390
you know that's a symptom of diabetes.

1103
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:12,140
Yeah.

1104
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:13,550
I don't have diabetes.

1105
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,290
Did you go to the doctor?

1106
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:15,800
All right.

1107
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:15,901
Well,

1108
00:32:15,901 --> 00:32:16,970
I mean my last checkup was,

1109
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:17,930
I was fine.

1110
00:32:17,930 --> 00:32:18,830
How many years ago was that?

1111
00:32:19,610 --> 00:32:20,450
Year and a half.

1112
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:23,720
Did you have those symptoms
a year and a half ago now?

1113
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:24,530
Well,

1114
00:32:24,530 --> 00:32:24,680
right.

1115
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:28,310
I've also wasn't taking boner
pills that have crazy shit at him.

1116
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:29,091
Well,

1117
00:32:29,091 --> 00:32:29,924
that's true.

1118
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:33,350
You know I would eliminate possibilities.

1119
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:33,890
Oh yeah.

1120
00:32:33,890 --> 00:32:34,730
That's what I'm doing right now.

1121
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:35,840
I'm not doing that anymore.

1122
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:38,180
He's got to stop drinking every
night and you got to stop smoking.

1123
00:32:38,181 --> 00:32:39,014
Stop doing that.

1124
00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:40,340
I've been drinking like every other night.

1125
00:32:40,341 --> 00:32:41,174
Maybe

1126
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:44,061
that's better.

1127
00:32:44,061 --> 00:32:45,230
That's better than every night.

1128
00:32:45,231 --> 00:32:46,400
Secret to not drinking.

1129
00:32:46,401 --> 00:32:47,270
What about the smoking?

1130
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:48,410
Don't go to the comedy store.

1131
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:52,280
How much do you smoke a pack a day?

1132
00:32:53,090 --> 00:32:53,520
You got,

1133
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,650
you did so well,

1134
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:57,650
and then you just fold it up again.

1135
00:32:58,580 --> 00:32:59,230
Yeah.

1136
00:32:59,230 --> 00:32:59,330
Oh,

1137
00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:00,050
that's another thing.

1138
00:33:00,050 --> 00:33:02,000
The reason why I
originally went to the FDA,

1139
00:33:02,001 --> 00:33:02,751
I just remembered it,

1140
00:33:02,751 --> 00:33:04,370
is because my favorite cigarette,

1141
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,450
which is a new cigarette,

1142
00:33:05,451 --> 00:33:09,840
got recalled from the FDA because they
said that they were not tested like they

1143
00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:14,150
were using all this fucking imagine how
bad your cigarettes have to be for the

1144
00:33:14,151 --> 00:33:14,870
FDA to go.

1145
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:15,381
You know what?

1146
00:33:15,381 --> 00:33:17,060
These cigarettes are fucked up.

1147
00:33:17,090 --> 00:33:17,600
Yeah.

1148
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:22,600
Those other ones that are killing people
at a rate of 500,000 premature deaths

1149
00:33:23,361 --> 00:33:25,790
per year in this country alone,

1150
00:33:27,050 --> 00:33:27,920
but they're like this,

1151
00:33:27,921 --> 00:33:28,970
this one's too fucked up.

1152
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,520
Came a whites and camel crush there.

1153
00:33:31,521 --> 00:33:35,420
They were not allowed to be sold because
they never would have been tested and

1154
00:33:35,421 --> 00:33:38,450
they were using all different new
filters and things that broken made meant

1155
00:33:38,451 --> 00:33:39,620
inside the cigarette.

1156
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:41,660
Maybe it's just people that
don't like white people.

1157
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:42,553
That's one thing.

1158
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:43,880
If you're going to have camels,

1159
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:44,901
those are white people,

1160
00:33:44,901 --> 00:33:45,734
cigarettes,

1161
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:47,713
cigarettes,

1162
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:48,920
Kools and black people.

1163
00:33:48,921 --> 00:33:49,580
Cigarettes.

1164
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:50,151
Like if you,

1165
00:33:50,151 --> 00:33:50,430
uh,

1166
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:52,160
upper white lights is a white woman,

1167
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:56,570
you either get cool cools or either like
secretaries who are super stressed out

1168
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:58,040
or single moms.

1169
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:00,240
They'll smoke Kools
occasionally and they have to,

1170
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,153
they're tanned.

1171
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:03,950
Then go to tanning booths or black guys.

1172
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:09,200
I'm a cigarette expert.

1173
00:34:09,201 --> 00:34:11,180
Yo Newport's who,

1174
00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:11,691
who smokes?

1175
00:34:11,691 --> 00:34:12,950
Newports I don't know.

1176
00:34:12,951 --> 00:34:14,720
Black people and people
who like black people,

1177
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:15,200
right?

1178
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,730
People hang out with black people.

1179
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:17,833
They swung.

1180
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:21,010
The worst is when you meet a
white person that smokes menthols.

1181
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:21,261
You're like,

1182
00:34:21,261 --> 00:34:24,020
what happened to you man and filtered.

1183
00:34:24,410 --> 00:34:26,630
That's all white guys who were trappers.

1184
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:29,450
They're all like fishermen and
trappers and shit and they fucking,

1185
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:30,920
they have hides,

1186
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:32,960
tanning hides on the side of their house,

1187
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:33,471
you know,

1188
00:34:33,471 --> 00:34:35,510
like tacked down to
hide and stretched down.

1189
00:34:35,511 --> 00:34:36,440
It was Alaska shows.

1190
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:39,020
Those are the guys who
smoke camels on filtered.

1191
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:43,250
The only reason I smoke this is James
Dean used to smoke lucky cigarettes and I

1192
00:34:43,251 --> 00:34:43,431
was like,

1193
00:34:43,431 --> 00:34:43,630
I'm,

1194
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:44,001
I'd be like,

1195
00:34:44,001 --> 00:34:46,910
James Dean could move lucky unfiltered.

1196
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:49,430
You know else James Deane smoked tolls.

1197
00:34:50,930 --> 00:34:52,040
He smoked polls too,

1198
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:55,190
so he probably like just
like things in his mouth.

1199
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:55,431
I mean,

1200
00:34:55,431 --> 00:34:56,241
nothing wrong with that,

1201
00:34:56,241 --> 00:34:57,890
but maybe you shouldn't do what he does.

1202
00:34:58,130 --> 00:34:59,660
What do you think about playboy man?

1203
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:01,560
Like taking all the nudity out.

1204
00:35:01,570 --> 00:35:02,540
He was very upset.

1205
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:04,550
Bailey j are the funniest tweet about it.

1206
00:35:04,610 --> 00:35:05,030
Yeah.

1207
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:05,301
Yeah.

1208
00:35:05,301 --> 00:35:06,134
She goes,

1209
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:06,680
she goes,

1210
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:08,660
there's girls online that have fist up.

1211
00:35:08,661 --> 00:35:09,410
They're assholes.

1212
00:35:09,410 --> 00:35:10,550
You weren't reading playboy.

1213
00:35:10,551 --> 00:35:11,384
Stop it.

1214
00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:12,963
Yeah,

1215
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:14,653
it's true.

1216
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:16,040
It's totally true.

1217
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,480
It's just fucking true.

1218
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:18,373
Larry Flynt,

1219
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:21,110
it was on like CNN the other
day and he said it perfect.

1220
00:35:21,111 --> 00:35:21,291
Like,

1221
00:35:21,291 --> 00:35:21,650
like,

1222
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:22,483
like,

1223
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,680
like you're taking your
bread and butter away.

1224
00:35:24,681 --> 00:35:26,740
Why would the fuck he's at Hugh Hefner?

1225
00:35:26,741 --> 00:35:28,370
It's just a horrible businessman.

1226
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:29,091
He's like,

1227
00:35:29,091 --> 00:35:29,201
he,

1228
00:35:29,201 --> 00:35:31,460
he's the magazine's fine.

1229
00:35:31,461 --> 00:35:31,671
You know,

1230
00:35:31,671 --> 00:35:32,630
don't touch it.

1231
00:35:32,810 --> 00:35:34,070
Well he's old.

1232
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:36,530
I don't think he's necessarily
running things anymore.

1233
00:35:36,531 --> 00:35:37,650
And I think this,

1234
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:38,190
the fact

1235
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:42,450
that we're talking about it means it was
a good idea cause we're talking about

1236
00:35:42,451 --> 00:35:42,690
it.

1237
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:44,070
No one talked about playboy,

1238
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:45,061
like playboy.

1239
00:35:45,061 --> 00:35:45,781
Nobody gave a fuck.

1240
00:35:45,781 --> 00:35:49,350
They have to literally have
to do something like this
in order to get people to

1241
00:35:49,351 --> 00:35:50,010
talk about it.

1242
00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:51,120
It might be a good idea.

1243
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:51,991
Honestly.

1244
00:35:51,991 --> 00:35:52,371
I mean I'm,

1245
00:35:52,371 --> 00:35:55,170
I'm the shittiest businessman
of all time cause I don't,

1246
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,810
I literally don't think
about business ever at all.

1247
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:02,840
I just do shit that I like to do and try
to like work as hard as I can and try

1248
00:36:03,181 --> 00:36:03,840
to keep going,

1249
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,730
find things that I'm
interested in and keep going.

1250
00:36:05,731 --> 00:36:06,564
I never sit down and go,

1251
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:08,580
what's the best business model?

1252
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:10,650
What I need to do for my brand.

1253
00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:12,180
I need to expand.

1254
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:15,420
What I need to do is I need to create
some sort of a publicity stunt.

1255
00:36:15,570 --> 00:36:17,760
But if I was going to
engineer a publicity stunt,

1256
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:19,230
that's the best one.

1257
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:21,720
He take either that or you show calming.

1258
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:25,590
He just show a lot of hair polling
and nothing in people's faces.

1259
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:30,870
He show like hardcore choking and Mascara
and snot coming out of girl's nose and

1260
00:36:31,201 --> 00:36:32,400
balls hitting Chin's.

1261
00:36:32,610 --> 00:36:34,350
You're either going to
go one way or the other.

1262
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,630
Either you're going to go the route of
the Internet and the Internet is going to

1263
00:36:36,631 --> 00:36:37,231
out Internet.

1264
00:36:37,231 --> 00:36:37,530
Yeah.

1265
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:38,490
Every fucking time.

1266
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,530
Or you're going to decide,

1267
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:40,891
you know what,

1268
00:36:40,891 --> 00:36:42,120
we're a gentleman's magazine now.

1269
00:36:42,121 --> 00:36:43,110
You can get plenty of porn.

1270
00:36:43,111 --> 00:36:43,980
You don't need us for that.

1271
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:45,120
You're not buying this in,

1272
00:36:45,121 --> 00:36:45,460
uh,

1273
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:46,290
uh,

1274
00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:47,123
airport.

1275
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:48,150
Fucking one.

1276
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,920
Those little s with the plastic.

1277
00:36:49,921 --> 00:36:51,990
You're not going to go jerk
off in your hotel room with us.

1278
00:36:51,991 --> 00:36:53,280
You just not does this.

1279
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,240
You have a laptop,

1280
00:36:54,241 --> 00:36:54,810
stop it.

1281
00:36:54,810 --> 00:36:55,643
Right.

1282
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:59,790
But they can offer like good articles,

1283
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:00,360
right?

1284
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:03,420
Like there's people that
have written for playboy,

1285
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:04,980
they were like really good writers.

1286
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:07,080
There's some really good stories
that had been written for playboy,

1287
00:37:07,081 --> 00:37:11,880
but it was always sort of obscured by
the fact that really what you were doing

1288
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:14,190
was buying it for chicks.

1289
00:37:14,191 --> 00:37:14,460
It was,

1290
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:16,080
that was the inside joke is like,

1291
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:16,291
oh,

1292
00:37:16,291 --> 00:37:17,430
I read it for the articles.

1293
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,750
That was the inside joke.

1294
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:22,470
Like people would laugh about how
nobody really read it for the articles.

1295
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,430
But if you go and like you ever
see like Frank Sinatra f interview,

1296
00:37:26,431 --> 00:37:26,641
the,

1297
00:37:26,641 --> 00:37:26,941
these,

1298
00:37:26,941 --> 00:37:28,170
those interviews and playboy,

1299
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:29,880
these do,

1300
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:30,481
if you're seeing those,

1301
00:37:30,481 --> 00:37:35,430
I actually have never read one single
article in the interviews are classic.

1302
00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:36,301
You know,

1303
00:37:36,301 --> 00:37:36,571
I,

1304
00:37:36,571 --> 00:37:39,660
I did an interview with playboy a long
time ago and that's when I got into it

1305
00:37:39,661 --> 00:37:40,494
with Denis leary.

1306
00:37:40,890 --> 00:37:41,160
Uh,

1307
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:41,490
yeah,

1308
00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:43,890
that was from one of
those playboy interviews.

1309
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:44,910
This,

1310
00:37:44,910 --> 00:37:47,460
they've always had playboys,

1311
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:49,440
always had like really good interviews.

1312
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:49,860
They vote.

1313
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:50,693
They had,

1314
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:51,301
like I said,

1315
00:37:51,301 --> 00:37:55,890
I used to have this coffee table book of
all the great interviews over the years

1316
00:37:55,891 --> 00:37:56,724
in playboy,

1317
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:57,713
but the,

1318
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,460
the whole feel of playboy,

1319
00:37:59,461 --> 00:38:00,780
Timmy was always style.

1320
00:38:00,810 --> 00:38:02,070
Like it was artistic.

1321
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:02,311
You know,

1322
00:38:02,311 --> 00:38:03,840
Hugh Hefner was an artist that,

1323
00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:04,470
you know,

1324
00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:07,110
made women look beautiful and like you,

1325
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,660
you wanted to see whatever.

1326
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:10,553
Uh,

1327
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:14,130
who else is Sigourney weaver naked?

1328
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,970
But you wanted to see waiver
and then we got naked and shit.

1329
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:18,570
You wanted to see her get naked.

1330
00:38:18,571 --> 00:38:19,990
Pamela Anderson Class.

1331
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,150
He corny weaver window.

1332
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:21,331
Yeah,

1333
00:38:21,331 --> 00:38:22,160
I know what you're saying.

1334
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,010
So famous.

1335
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:26,940
You wanted to see a class like that's
where Kardashians should have had her butt

1336
00:38:26,941 --> 00:38:28,770
shots instead of that other thing.

1337
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:30,150
It was too late though.

1338
00:38:30,330 --> 00:38:31,470
By the time she came along.

1339
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:32,940
It was a ghost town.

1340
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:33,750
Right.

1341
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:34,800
But playboy,

1342
00:38:34,801 --> 00:38:35,110
yeah.

1343
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:38,020
No one's talking about playboy because
no one's talking about magazines at all.

1344
00:38:38,021 --> 00:38:39,280
Anything about magazines?

1345
00:38:39,281 --> 00:38:42,480
Playboy problem I think is like
what Larry Flynn was saying,

1346
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,200
that their business is all fucked up.

1347
00:38:44,201 --> 00:38:44,681
Playboys.

1348
00:38:44,681 --> 00:38:47,470
I believe it's subscription
based to listen to playboy radio.

1349
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:49,150
You have to pay $7 a month.

1350
00:38:49,151 --> 00:38:49,391
You know,

1351
00:38:49,391 --> 00:38:50,200
it's like a stew.

1352
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:50,560
Yeah.

1353
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:53,110
It's not like you can just
turn on all playboy radio.

1354
00:38:53,111 --> 00:38:53,400
You know,

1355
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:53,680
it's,

1356
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:54,250
wait a minute,

1357
00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:55,540
is it on serious?

1358
00:38:55,570 --> 00:38:56,500
It used to be on serious,

1359
00:38:56,501 --> 00:38:57,490
but I think Sirius was like,

1360
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,060
Eh,

1361
00:38:58,060 --> 00:38:59,080
we don't care about this anymore.

1362
00:38:59,081 --> 00:38:59,531
Bad on the,

1363
00:38:59,531 --> 00:38:59,950
sure.

1364
00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:00,281
Yeah.

1365
00:39:00,281 --> 00:39:01,900
I used to be 10 bucks a month though,

1366
00:39:01,901 --> 00:39:03,730
or something like that on serious anymore.

1367
00:39:03,731 --> 00:39:04,564
I don't think it is

1368
00:39:05,970 --> 00:39:06,803
valuable.

1369
00:39:08,990 --> 00:39:09,823
The,

1370
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:12,800
the model is definitely dying.

1371
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,180
The magazine model,

1372
00:39:14,890 --> 00:39:15,723
um,

1373
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:18,630
well it was an internet radio station
and originally launched on Xm Sirius

1374
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:21,570
on a,

1375
00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:22,291
okay,

1376
00:39:22,291 --> 00:39:22,740
here we go.

1377
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:25,380
On March 9th,

1378
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:25,410
2013,

1379
00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:27,480
Kevin Kline and Andrea,

1380
00:39:27,481 --> 00:39:30,660
they announced that playboy morning
showed that the playboy will no longer be

1381
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:32,430
featured on sm Eric,

1382
00:39:32,431 --> 00:39:33,264
Sirius Xm.

1383
00:39:33,490 --> 00:39:33,950
Hmm.

1384
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:34,230
Uh,

1385
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:37,800
you can only go to playboy radio
and they want you to pay for it.

1386
00:39:37,801 --> 00:39:39,090
Playboy radio.com.

1387
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:39,520
Yeah.

1388
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,990
See that's a big mistake.

1389
00:39:40,991 --> 00:39:41,470
Yeah.

1390
00:39:41,470 --> 00:39:43,720
That's a big mistake to get
people to pay for it because,

1391
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:43,891
well,

1392
00:39:43,891 --> 00:39:44,591
why would they do that?

1393
00:39:44,591 --> 00:39:46,960
When you can get the Ted Radio Hour,

1394
00:39:46,961 --> 00:39:48,790
you can get getting Doug with high,

1395
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:49,751
you get killed,

1396
00:39:49,751 --> 00:39:50,441
Tony.

1397
00:39:50,441 --> 00:39:52,630
You can get the Church
of what's happening now.

1398
00:39:52,631 --> 00:39:53,200
You can get,

1399
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,130
you can get fucking,

1400
00:39:54,610 --> 00:39:59,290
there's so many podcasts that are amazing
and they're free for playboy to come

1401
00:39:59,291 --> 00:39:59,861
along and say,

1402
00:39:59,861 --> 00:40:00,011
hey,

1403
00:40:00,011 --> 00:40:03,340
we want $10 a month or $7
a month or whatever it is.

1404
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:05,170
It's $7 a month.

1405
00:40:05,171 --> 00:40:06,940
Too much or $10 a month too much.

1406
00:40:06,941 --> 00:40:07,301
It's just,

1407
00:40:07,301 --> 00:40:08,080
you can't do it.

1408
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:08,860
You can't,

1409
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:09,820
it's a shitty model.

1410
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:10,511
That's you're,

1411
00:40:10,511 --> 00:40:10,781
you're,

1412
00:40:10,781 --> 00:40:11,614
you're,

1413
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:16,710
you're operating on this idea that likes
subscription based stuff still exists.

1414
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:19,840
And it really doesn't,

1415
00:40:19,841 --> 00:40:21,340
unless it's something like Netflix,

1416
00:40:21,550 --> 00:40:26,550
just think about how arrogant you would
have to be to want $7 a month for your

1417
00:40:26,591 --> 00:40:28,150
fucking podcast,

1418
00:40:28,151 --> 00:40:29,380
your radio show,

1419
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:33,160
when you can get Netflix
for nine bucks a month.

1420
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:34,001
Did they raised it right?

1421
00:40:34,001 --> 00:40:35,950
They made it nine now I think Netflix did.

1422
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:37,890
It's still a great deal.

1423
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:38,920
Amazing deal.

1424
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:40,180
Just stop and think about that.

1425
00:40:40,330 --> 00:40:43,120
Think about how many fucking
standup comedy specials I believe.

1426
00:40:43,330 --> 00:40:43,481
Oh,

1427
00:40:43,481 --> 00:40:44,270
I can't even say that.

1428
00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:45,103
I'm not supposed to,

1429
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:45,990
but um,

1430
00:40:45,990 --> 00:40:46,260
look,

1431
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:46,541
I think,

1432
00:40:46,541 --> 00:40:48,970
just think bill burrs specials.

1433
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:51,850
Thompson Sigora just
shot his second special,

1434
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:52,660
you know,

1435
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:53,290
fuck I,

1436
00:40:53,290 --> 00:40:55,690
I did one on Netflix in 2005.

1437
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:56,620
So it's like,

1438
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:57,580
you think about all,

1439
00:40:57,581 --> 00:40:58,271
it's 10 bucks an hour,

1440
00:40:58,271 --> 00:40:59,104
is that what you're showing me?

1441
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:00,393
Playboy radio

1442
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:03,610
radio is $4 and 17 cents a month.

1443
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:06,020
If you do it 12 months a description.

1444
00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:07,430
If you do it for one month,

1445
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:08,293
it's what?

1446
00:41:08,730 --> 00:41:10,520
17% about $5 a month.

1447
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:11,120
Okay,

1448
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,080
so five bucks a month.

1449
00:41:12,110 --> 00:41:14,900
It's still more reasonable
with still ridiculous.

1450
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:16,880
No one's paying that bad business model.

1451
00:41:16,881 --> 00:41:18,080
It's terrible business model.

1452
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:18,860
It's like,

1453
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:19,071
you know,

1454
00:41:19,071 --> 00:41:20,720
they're talking about doing
that with Howard Stern.

1455
00:41:21,050 --> 00:41:25,190
They were talking about doing that with
something like Spotify and make it the

1456
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:27,170
way they were talking was so gross.

1457
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:28,190
And then I said they,

1458
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:32,600
I mean these business analysts who were
quoting people who supposedly work for

1459
00:41:32,601 --> 00:41:33,230
this show,

1460
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:34,640
it could be all bullshit.

1461
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:36,080
It could be all rumors,

1462
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:38,960
but the way they were saying it
was like they were banking on it.

1463
00:41:38,961 --> 00:41:39,201
You know,

1464
00:41:39,201 --> 00:41:41,360
because at the end of the day,

1465
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:44,030
if there's anybody that can
get people to pay for war,

1466
00:41:44,090 --> 00:41:44,660
uh,

1467
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:45,860
some sort of a podcast,

1468
00:41:45,890 --> 00:41:46,520
it's him.

1469
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:46,671
I mean,

1470
00:41:46,671 --> 00:41:49,550
he's got Howard Stern's got
the most loyal listeners.

1471
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:51,260
It's been around the longest time.

1472
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:52,490
There's people that for him,

1473
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:53,300
for them,

1474
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:56,690
he's a part of their daily
commute and has been for decades.

1475
00:41:56,691 --> 00:41:57,440
Right?

1476
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:02,440
But they were talking about like doing
it where it's like $7 a month for his

1477
00:42:02,841 --> 00:42:03,560
show.

1478
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:04,191
And they were like,

1479
00:42:04,191 --> 00:42:06,950
we could get 10 million listeners,

1480
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,990
so he'd be getting $70 million a month.

1481
00:42:08,991 --> 00:42:09,380
I'm like,

1482
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:09,651
bitch,

1483
00:42:09,651 --> 00:42:11,150
are you out of your fucking mind?

1484
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:13,700
You really think you're going
to get 10 million people?

1485
00:42:13,790 --> 00:42:17,540
They're going to pay $7
a month for a podcast.

1486
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:18,650
10 million.

1487
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,120
Good luck.

1488
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,081
Good fuck.

1489
00:42:21,081 --> 00:42:22,190
That's crazy talk.

1490
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:24,470
But listen to someone
say something like that.

1491
00:42:24,471 --> 00:42:24,740
I was like,

1492
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:25,220
Ooh,

1493
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:26,330
look how they think.

1494
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:27,590
They just looking at it like,

1495
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:27,771
Ooh,

1496
00:42:27,771 --> 00:42:28,790
this is a business.

1497
00:42:28,910 --> 00:42:29,743
Not like,

1498
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:33,710
let's just keep doing the most kick ass
radio show in the history of the world.

1499
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:35,780
Let's keep having these amazing guests.

1500
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:36,950
Isn't it crazy?

1501
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:41,210
Howard's been on the air for decades
and he's got all this stuff banked up.

1502
00:42:41,211 --> 00:42:45,100
You can listen to Howard 100 and year
classic interviews from back and it's

1503
00:42:45,110 --> 00:42:45,591
amazing.

1504
00:42:45,591 --> 00:42:47,030
Let's keep this better and better.

1505
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:47,480
Nope,

1506
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:48,320
that's not how they think.

1507
00:42:48,590 --> 00:42:49,250
They think,

1508
00:42:49,250 --> 00:42:50,870
how do we make money off of them?

1509
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:56,260
How do we take this guy and how do we
turn this into 10 million subscribers

1510
00:42:56,811 --> 00:43:00,680
paying $70 a month and then they're all
thinking if I just get a piece of that,

1511
00:43:01,010 --> 00:43:01,940
if I get a piece of that,

1512
00:43:01,941 --> 00:43:05,180
that they're looking at their house in
the Hamptons and then they thinking about

1513
00:43:05,181 --> 00:43:05,781
their Porsche,

1514
00:43:05,781 --> 00:43:06,820
there'll be drive in.

1515
00:43:07,190 --> 00:43:08,300
Ah Right.

1516
00:43:08,301 --> 00:43:12,320
And then you've got all these people
around you that are like grabbing and

1517
00:43:12,321 --> 00:43:13,730
pulling and tugging.

1518
00:43:13,790 --> 00:43:14,660
That's what it's like.

1519
00:43:14,661 --> 00:43:19,661
If you work for some big
giant ass corporation that
feeds off of having a bunch

1520
00:43:20,031 --> 00:43:21,440
of different shows on its network.

1521
00:43:21,830 --> 00:43:24,110
Like if you work for some corporation,

1522
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:24,530
like a,

1523
00:43:24,530 --> 00:43:27,530
like a Sirius XM or playboy
or anything like that,

1524
00:43:27,531 --> 00:43:29,500
like they need to keep
that fucking thing alive.

1525
00:43:29,750 --> 00:43:31,190
Like we need money coming in.

1526
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,200
We cannot just operate on the ideas.

1527
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:34,610
We need money coming in.

1528
00:43:35,210 --> 00:43:35,391
Well,

1529
00:43:35,391 --> 00:43:38,750
I think we can get playboy radio and a
half people will pay about $7 a month.

1530
00:43:38,751 --> 00:43:39,584
Let's do it.

1531
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:40,341
Seven Mag.

1532
00:43:40,341 --> 00:43:40,790
That money,

1533
00:43:40,790 --> 00:43:41,210
how much?

1534
00:43:41,210 --> 00:43:42,290
How many people do you
think we're going to make?

1535
00:43:42,530 --> 00:43:43,610
I think about a million a month.

1536
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:44,900
1 million a month.

1537
00:43:45,050 --> 00:43:45,980
5 million a month.

1538
00:43:45,981 --> 00:43:46,631
We're out of the whole,

1539
00:43:46,631 --> 00:43:47,720
how the whole in six months.

1540
00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:50,210
And people start thinking
like that and then,

1541
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:51,313
you know,

1542
00:43:51,830 --> 00:43:52,790
but what the fuck do I know?

1543
00:43:53,490 --> 00:43:54,000
Oh Shit.

1544
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:54,960
Larry Flynt also said,

1545
00:43:54,961 --> 00:43:55,171
you know,

1546
00:43:55,171 --> 00:43:55,861
like look,

1547
00:43:55,861 --> 00:43:58,340
he playboy probably has 43 writers.

1548
00:43:58,360 --> 00:43:58,561
You know,

1549
00:43:58,561 --> 00:43:58,681
he,

1550
00:43:58,681 --> 00:43:58,891
they,

1551
00:43:58,891 --> 00:44:01,080
they probably have a shitload of writers.

1552
00:44:01,081 --> 00:44:01,441
He's like,

1553
00:44:01,441 --> 00:44:02,340
I have seven.

1554
00:44:02,430 --> 00:44:02,881
He's like,

1555
00:44:02,881 --> 00:44:03,600
he's like,

1556
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:04,820
he's like very Flint said that.

1557
00:44:04,830 --> 00:44:05,400
Yeah.

1558
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:06,180
And it makes sense.

1559
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:07,110
He's like Larry flynts.

1560
00:44:07,111 --> 00:44:08,550
Like I make a profit every month.

1561
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:09,150
They don't,

1562
00:44:09,150 --> 00:44:09,481
you know,

1563
00:44:09,481 --> 00:44:10,314
I mean,

1564
00:44:10,490 --> 00:44:12,750
and he's got a hardcore shit on his,

1565
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:14,033
you know,

1566
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:14,580
his,

1567
00:44:14,580 --> 00:44:15,413
his magazines.

1568
00:44:15,610 --> 00:44:16,443
Hardcores fuck.

1569
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:18,270
And I still bought,

1570
00:44:18,271 --> 00:44:18,580
you know,

1571
00:44:18,580 --> 00:44:19,230
house.

1572
00:44:19,230 --> 00:44:20,820
I still buy a penthouse occasionally.

1573
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:22,560
I actually don't with,

1574
00:44:23,830 --> 00:44:24,180
well,

1575
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:25,013
you know,

1576
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:29,310
I swear to God,

1577
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:29,940
I do.

1578
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:30,900
I bought one the other day.

1579
00:44:31,470 --> 00:44:32,303
American money.

1580
00:44:33,210 --> 00:44:34,910
You don't use bitcoin
or anything like that?

1581
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:35,260
Okay.

1582
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:37,180
Oh it's my ex girlfriend
on the cover and my bike,

1583
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:38,073
so

1584
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:38,421
yeah,

1585
00:44:38,421 --> 00:44:39,254
that's fine.

1586
00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:40,370
Yeah.

1587
00:44:40,370 --> 00:44:41,203
Um,

1588
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:43,610
I just don't think that they can make it.

1589
00:44:44,330 --> 00:44:46,760
It's like you can scrape out
as much money as you have.

1590
00:44:46,761 --> 00:44:47,900
Keep a skeleton crew,

1591
00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:48,920
run,

1592
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:51,660
run those magazines as long
as you can while there,

1593
00:44:51,690 --> 00:44:52,730
as long as they're profitable.

1594
00:44:52,731 --> 00:44:54,410
But be ready to pull that shoot,

1595
00:44:55,010 --> 00:44:56,120
be ready to pull that shoot.

1596
00:44:56,530 --> 00:44:59,540
Cause now like you can
just get shit on your iPad,

1597
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:00,433
that's new.

1598
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:03,320
And then they have these things that are
like essentially like Spotify for your

1599
00:45:03,321 --> 00:45:04,040
iPad.

1600
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:07,700
Say you can choose from a bunch of
different magazines like time and Newsweek

1601
00:45:07,701 --> 00:45:11,450
and all these different magazines
or you can get them on your iPad,

1602
00:45:11,510 --> 00:45:12,201
go through it,

1603
00:45:12,201 --> 00:45:12,981
you download it,

1604
00:45:12,981 --> 00:45:15,290
you get each page as a full image,

1605
00:45:15,291 --> 00:45:18,380
you can stretch it out and move
in and it's so much better.

1606
00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:19,820
It's so much better.

1607
00:45:19,970 --> 00:45:23,150
And once they start doing it like that
where you have like these subscriptions,

1608
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:24,733
you know,

1609
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:27,070
it's not going to last
they actual print thing.

1610
00:45:27,070 --> 00:45:28,490
It's just not going to be around anymore.

1611
00:45:28,610 --> 00:45:29,900
Why would you want that print thing?

1612
00:45:29,901 --> 00:45:32,900
It's killing paper or its killing
trees rather than make that paper.

1613
00:45:33,050 --> 00:45:34,040
You could just get the,

1614
00:45:34,041 --> 00:45:36,820
the thing downloaded to your
phone instantly like that.

1615
00:45:36,821 --> 00:45:38,210
It's just ones and Zeros in the air.

1616
00:45:38,990 --> 00:45:39,650
You know,

1617
00:45:39,650 --> 00:45:40,430
you don't,

1618
00:45:40,430 --> 00:45:41,263
it's not gonna make it,

1619
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:42,021
it's just,

1620
00:45:42,021 --> 00:45:43,940
it's like the dew tour,

1621
00:45:44,010 --> 00:45:44,843
Morse code,

1622
00:45:44,970 --> 00:45:45,270
you know,

1623
00:45:45,270 --> 00:45:45,420
like,

1624
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:45,710
listen,

1625
00:45:45,710 --> 00:45:46,543
I'm telling Ya,

1626
00:45:46,610 --> 00:45:48,100
this is the way the talk that I,

1627
00:45:48,150 --> 00:45:48,983
the,

1628
00:45:49,630 --> 00:45:50,930
it'll never go away.

1629
00:45:50,931 --> 00:45:52,820
We'll always need boys code.

1630
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:53,960
Nope.

1631
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:55,430
Nobody knows how to do that anymore.

1632
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:56,533
SOS,

1633
00:45:56,700 --> 00:45:57,171

Remember it was one,

1641
00:46:00,951 --> 00:46:01,311
two,

1642
00:46:01,311 --> 00:46:01,701
three,

1643
00:46:01,701 --> 00:46:01,881
one,

1644
00:46:01,881 --> 00:46:01,971
two,

1645
00:46:01,971 --> 00:46:02,480

1648
00:46:07,631 --> 00:46:10,670
it has to sit there and try to figure
out how many beeps that guy just did.

1649
00:46:10,671 --> 00:46:12,740
And you're spacing out
and he's beeping at you.

1650
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:15,500
Well,

1651
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:16,940
getting a message from the western front

1652
00:46:17,130 --> 00:46:17,963
today,

1653
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:20,120
Eh,

1654
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:21,530
you got to write all that down.

1655
00:46:21,770 --> 00:46:22,371
Oh my God.

1656
00:46:22,371 --> 00:46:23,540
And then you figure out when is,

1657
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:24,590
when is the word done?

1658
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:25,701
You Fuck,

1659
00:46:25,701 --> 00:46:27,110
you didn't put enough of a pause and

1660
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:30,650
you stopped do that in boy scouts SOS.

1661
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:31,341
Did you?

1662
00:46:31,341 --> 00:46:31,840
Yeah,

1663
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:33,410
that we had to know how to do it.

1664
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:36,410
We had to know like what the signal was.

1665
00:46:36,411 --> 00:46:36,741
One,

1666
00:46:36,741 --> 00:46:37,011
two,

1667
00:46:37,011 --> 00:46:37,371
three,

1668
00:46:37,371 --> 00:46:37,551
one,

1669
00:46:37,551 --> 00:46:37,671
two,

1670
00:46:37,671 --> 00:46:38,050
three.

1671
00:46:38,050 --> 00:46:38,871
But I mean,

1672
00:46:38,871 --> 00:46:39,710
how are you going to send it?

1673
00:46:39,740 --> 00:46:41,810
What do you send anything with
you going to bang on a drum,

1674
00:46:42,210 --> 00:46:43,220
radio ball,

1675
00:46:43,221 --> 00:46:43,881
ball ball,

1676
00:46:43,881 --> 00:46:44,061
ball,

1677
00:46:44,061 --> 00:46:44,710
ball ball,

1678
00:46:44,710 --> 00:46:45,680
be had an am radio.

1679
00:46:45,681 --> 00:46:47,120
You can't transmit ham.

1680
00:46:47,870 --> 00:46:48,081
Oh,

1681
00:46:48,081 --> 00:46:48,914
ham radio.

1682
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:50,151
That was a big thing,

1683
00:46:50,151 --> 00:46:50,450
man.

1684
00:46:50,450 --> 00:46:51,283
Still is.

1685
00:46:51,850 --> 00:46:52,570
I remember my,

1686
00:46:52,570 --> 00:46:53,231
my uncle,

1687
00:46:53,231 --> 00:46:53,531
uh,

1688
00:46:53,531 --> 00:46:55,990
he would always let me play
with it and he'll be like,

1689
00:46:55,991 --> 00:46:56,141
yeah,

1690
00:46:56,141 --> 00:46:57,850
this guy's in Japan right now.

1691
00:46:57,851 --> 00:46:58,181
And you're like,

1692
00:46:58,181 --> 00:46:58,361
oh,

1693
00:46:58,361 --> 00:46:58,721
hi,

1694
00:46:58,721 --> 00:46:59,530
you're in Japan.

1695
00:46:59,530 --> 00:47:00,141
What the fuck?

1696
00:47:00,141 --> 00:47:01,180
How are we talking?

1697
00:47:01,181 --> 00:47:02,014
Right.

1698
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:03,550
It was a cool thing to do,

1699
00:47:03,551 --> 00:47:04,470
but to go online,

1700
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:06,420
start a chat with some guy from Japan,

1701
00:47:06,421 --> 00:47:07,920
he's just going to show you his dick.

1702
00:47:08,370 --> 00:47:09,300
It's just a matter of time,

1703
00:47:10,340 --> 00:47:10,950
you know,

1704
00:47:10,950 --> 00:47:11,551
there's no like,

1705
00:47:11,551 --> 00:47:12,930
friendship thing like that,

1706
00:47:12,931 --> 00:47:13,920
like ham radio.

1707
00:47:14,350 --> 00:47:15,330
Like back then,

1708
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:18,030
if you were on the radio with some guy,

1709
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:18,661
you know,

1710
00:47:18,661 --> 00:47:19,260
and you're like,

1711
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:19,650
uh,

1712
00:47:19,650 --> 00:47:20,850
so you,

1713
00:47:20,851 --> 00:47:22,770
what time is it in Germany?

1714
00:47:22,950 --> 00:47:24,630
Time for me to fuck your mother,

1715
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:24,990
you know,

1716
00:47:24,990 --> 00:47:25,823
like that did,

1717
00:47:25,950 --> 00:47:27,150
they didn't talk like that.

1718
00:47:27,151 --> 00:47:28,680
They didn't talk like Internet people.

1719
00:47:28,930 --> 00:47:31,120
They had to actually
like speak to each other.

1720
00:47:31,570 --> 00:47:34,140
So because that element
of you say something,

1721
00:47:34,150 --> 00:47:35,050
someone reacts,

1722
00:47:35,290 --> 00:47:36,880
there was probably way less trolling.

1723
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:37,870
I'm sure there was like,

1724
00:47:37,870 --> 00:47:39,220
and you could get in trouble too.

1725
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:43,930
Like you get your ham radio license taken
away from you if you do shitty things.

1726
00:47:44,410 --> 00:47:45,240
Right.

1727
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:46,930
I don't even think
you're allowed to swear.

1728
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:48,850
I think on a ham radio,

1729
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:50,860
I think there's like
restrictions on language

1730
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:52,250
[inaudible] right.

1731
00:47:52,550 --> 00:47:53,510
It is regulated.

1732
00:47:53,511 --> 00:47:53,870
Right?

1733
00:47:53,870 --> 00:47:54,600
I don't know.

1734
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:55,040
I,

1735
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:55,873
let's see.

1736
00:47:55,910 --> 00:47:59,090
I know they're going to make
you a register your drones now,

1737
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:00,980
so it's gonna be like a car.

1738
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:02,480
You're gonna have to get
like a fishing license.

1739
00:48:02,481 --> 00:48:04,610
Probably every time you get a drone.

1740
00:48:05,870 --> 00:48:06,703
It makes sense.

1741
00:48:06,770 --> 00:48:08,060
That was only a matter of time.

1742
00:48:08,390 --> 00:48:09,230
I was um,

1743
00:48:09,860 --> 00:48:10,191
in,

1744
00:48:10,191 --> 00:48:11,024
uh,

1745
00:48:11,810 --> 00:48:13,160
Alberta last year or this,

1746
00:48:13,161 --> 00:48:13,281
uh,

1747
00:48:13,281 --> 00:48:13,581
this,

1748
00:48:13,581 --> 00:48:13,730
uh,

1749
00:48:13,730 --> 00:48:14,563
spring rather.

1750
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:19,340
And this guy had one that was attached
to a cell phone and he's flying it around

1751
00:48:19,350 --> 00:48:22,820
land and we're watching the
image on the cell phone,

1752
00:48:22,940 --> 00:48:23,181
you know,

1753
00:48:23,181 --> 00:48:24,110
cause it's transmitting.

1754
00:48:24,111 --> 00:48:24,471
And I was like,

1755
00:48:24,471 --> 00:48:25,880
this is fucking crazy.

1756
00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:27,350
This is way too good.

1757
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:28,850
It's way too good.

1758
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:30,800
Way Too good and way too easy.

1759
00:48:30,830 --> 00:48:32,180
Cause he's just maneuvering it,

1760
00:48:32,770 --> 00:48:33,270
you know,

1761
00:48:33,270 --> 00:48:33,891
moving it right.

1762
00:48:33,891 --> 00:48:35,090
You can do it with your phone.

1763
00:48:35,091 --> 00:48:36,200
You can do it with a remote.

1764
00:48:36,260 --> 00:48:37,700
They're the ones that they have now.

1765
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:38,870
There's a lot of them too.

1766
00:48:38,871 --> 00:48:39,890
A lot of different models.

1767
00:48:40,070 --> 00:48:41,600
They're fucking really good man.

1768
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:42,481
Yeah.

1769
00:48:42,481 --> 00:48:44,190
I was thinking about
getting one a while ago,

1770
00:48:44,191 --> 00:48:45,930
but I think I'll wait it out.

1771
00:48:46,230 --> 00:48:49,470
It looks like it would be fun
just to do like cool video stuff.

1772
00:48:50,620 --> 00:48:51,220
Yeah.

1773
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:52,000
Um,

1774
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:52,780
it is,

1775
00:48:52,780 --> 00:48:53,710
it is cool.

1776
00:48:53,740 --> 00:48:53,951
I mean,

1777
00:48:53,951 --> 00:48:54,611
they're still cool.

1778
00:48:54,611 --> 00:48:55,990
I wonder if you get grandfathered in.

1779
00:48:56,270 --> 00:48:58,220
It's like if you have like
an AK 47 or something,

1780
00:48:58,240 --> 00:48:59,150
the grant come and tag it.

1781
00:48:59,250 --> 00:48:59,580
Yeah,

1782
00:48:59,580 --> 00:49:00,413
I am now.

1783
00:49:00,550 --> 00:49:00,800
Uh,

1784
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:02,070
you posted the wrong link off.

1785
00:49:02,071 --> 00:49:03,340
So on your Twitter for what?

1786
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:06,200
So you guys are on youtube now
streaming instead of a youth.

1787
00:49:06,290 --> 00:49:06,411
Oh,

1788
00:49:06,411 --> 00:49:07,720
did I post to the use?

1789
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:08,640
Oops.

1790
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:09,740
At Jesus Christ.

1791
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:10,451
I,

1792
00:49:10,451 --> 00:49:11,900
it looks great on youtube though.

1793
00:49:11,901 --> 00:49:13,220
I'm looking at the picture quality,

1794
00:49:13,221 --> 00:49:13,371
right?

1795
00:49:13,371 --> 00:49:14,270
How do I find it right now,

1796
00:49:14,271 --> 00:49:14,571
Jamie,

1797
00:49:14,571 --> 00:49:17,990
if I want to find it so
we're not on Ustream.

1798
00:49:18,170 --> 00:49:18,890
I just tweeted,

1799
00:49:18,890 --> 00:49:22,610
I just tweeted the right still haven't
figured out how to do the Ustream at the

1800
00:49:22,611 --> 00:49:23,180
same time.

1801
00:49:23,180 --> 00:49:23,730
Yeah.

1802
00:49:23,730 --> 00:49:24,080
All right,

1803
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:24,740
hold on.

1804
00:49:24,740 --> 00:49:29,270
You should be able to just
split it that video so it's not,

1805
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:30,290
it doesn't work that way.

1806
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:32,420
The Ham radio stuff,

1807
00:49:32,421 --> 00:49:33,500
it's an amateur radio.

1808
00:49:33,501 --> 00:49:34,460
There's regulations,

1809
00:49:34,461 --> 00:49:36,130
but it depends on how big prior,

1810
00:49:36,131 --> 00:49:37,820
how strong your ham radio signal is.

1811
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:40,010
Stuff you can broadcast really strongly.

1812
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:43,310
Then you become like you're a little
radio station and then you have

1813
00:49:43,311 --> 00:49:44,144
regulations,

1814
00:49:44,170 --> 00:49:45,003
but well,

1815
00:49:45,290 --> 00:49:50,290
how has that technology work to where
people in other countries are listening to

1816
00:49:51,651 --> 00:49:51,951
it though?

1817
00:49:51,951 --> 00:49:53,780
It's like what kind of
radio station is this?

1818
00:49:53,781 --> 00:49:54,850
It's better than FM.

1819
00:49:55,090 --> 00:49:55,440
Oh,

1820
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:56,160
because it's a little,

1821
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:57,710
it's like a low frequency signal.

1822
00:49:58,810 --> 00:50:01,100
Like you can get am radio
from all over the place,

1823
00:50:01,101 --> 00:50:01,610
right?

1824
00:50:01,610 --> 00:50:02,480
Just in your house.

1825
00:50:02,970 --> 00:50:03,570
Okay.

1826
00:50:03,570 --> 00:50:06,930
You can get radio from radio,

1827
00:50:06,931 --> 00:50:08,490
radio goes further,

1828
00:50:08,790 --> 00:50:13,250
radio am radio rather it goes further
than FM but just doesn't have as high a a

1829
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:13,830
bandwidth.

1830
00:50:13,830 --> 00:50:14,011
It's,

1831
00:50:14,011 --> 00:50:16,080
I find it amazing when people
are still listening to radio.

1832
00:50:16,081 --> 00:50:16,914
That's another one.

1833
00:50:17,070 --> 00:50:18,390
I thought that would have been gone too.

1834
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:20,220
I still listen to them unfortunately,

1835
00:50:20,250 --> 00:50:22,560
but I have friends at work in it and uh,

1836
00:50:22,650 --> 00:50:23,010
you know,

1837
00:50:23,010 --> 00:50:23,281
they'll,

1838
00:50:23,281 --> 00:50:24,090
it's brutal.

1839
00:50:24,090 --> 00:50:25,140
You watch the way they work.

1840
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:27,000
It's the same thing because what they're,

1841
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:28,130
right,

1842
00:50:28,130 --> 00:50:29,720
besides the plane record part,

1843
00:50:29,990 --> 00:50:33,740
what they're doing as a podcast and
the plane record part would be fucking

1844
00:50:33,770 --> 00:50:35,210
infinitely easier,

1845
00:50:35,390 --> 00:50:37,490
infinitely easier if you
could do it on a podcast,

1846
00:50:37,970 --> 00:50:40,290
if you could just play
records on a podcast.

1847
00:50:40,291 --> 00:50:43,280
So you don't need a bunch of
people working behind the scenes.

1848
00:50:43,281 --> 00:50:43,520
You know,

1849
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:43,911
you just,

1850
00:50:43,911 --> 00:50:44,744
you just play it.

1851
00:50:44,870 --> 00:50:47,960
And if we could just play anything
you wanted but you can't really,

1852
00:50:48,410 --> 00:50:49,280
you can play it.

1853
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:50,660
But there's like fair use.

1854
00:50:50,661 --> 00:50:53,750
You could use something
in certain podcasts,

1855
00:50:53,751 --> 00:50:54,450
he could use it,

1856
00:50:54,450 --> 00:50:55,010
but it's,

1857
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:58,010
it's not a hundred percent
clearly defined right now.

1858
00:50:58,460 --> 00:50:59,690
But for radio man,

1859
00:51:00,050 --> 00:51:00,410
dude,

1860
00:51:00,410 --> 00:51:01,460
I talked to a,

1861
00:51:01,461 --> 00:51:02,390
I don't want to say their names,

1862
00:51:02,630 --> 00:51:04,190
but they're good guys and they're,

1863
00:51:04,191 --> 00:51:05,120
they're fun guys.

1864
00:51:05,121 --> 00:51:06,320
And I like doing the show.

1865
00:51:06,470 --> 00:51:07,303
But um,

1866
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:08,720
one of them was,

1867
00:51:08,721 --> 00:51:08,930
uh,

1868
00:51:08,930 --> 00:51:11,030
telling me that they
just got done with their,

1869
00:51:11,031 --> 00:51:11,864
uh,

1870
00:51:12,230 --> 00:51:12,440
you know,

1871
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:14,240
they have a review where
the company comes in,

1872
00:51:14,241 --> 00:51:14,751
sits him down,

1873
00:51:14,751 --> 00:51:15,500
he goes,

1874
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:15,861
he goes,

1875
00:51:15,861 --> 00:51:17,450
they fucking hate everything we did.

1876
00:51:17,451 --> 00:51:17,721
We,

1877
00:51:17,721 --> 00:51:17,910
we,

1878
00:51:17,910 --> 00:51:20,030
we've been successful for decades.

1879
00:51:20,150 --> 00:51:21,140
They've been around forever.

1880
00:51:21,290 --> 00:51:21,950
And he goes,

1881
00:51:21,950 --> 00:51:23,660
I've never had one of these
meetings where they say,

1882
00:51:23,661 --> 00:51:24,350
we're doing great.

1883
00:51:24,350 --> 00:51:25,070
Never.

1884
00:51:25,070 --> 00:51:26,000
Everything is bad.

1885
00:51:26,001 --> 00:51:27,260
Everything is not good.

1886
00:51:27,470 --> 00:51:28,940
They're always looking to cut staff.

1887
00:51:28,941 --> 00:51:30,320
They're always looking to fire people.

1888
00:51:30,530 --> 00:51:35,530
It's just like this total negative
meeting with these misers and these money

1889
00:51:36,021 --> 00:51:38,090
people and these numbers crunchers.

1890
00:51:38,090 --> 00:51:38,720
And they're like,

1891
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:40,670
we have to maximize profits.

1892
00:51:40,860 --> 00:51:41,421
We have to fit.

1893
00:51:41,421 --> 00:51:44,960
We have a strategy to maximize
profits when need more commercial.

1894
00:51:44,961 --> 00:51:46,190
Two I had more commercials.

1895
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:46,971
So like you'll,

1896
00:51:46,971 --> 00:51:47,300
you'll,

1897
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:52,220
you'll do a break and then they'll play
like seven minutes of commercials and

1898
00:51:52,221 --> 00:51:54,550
then they'll play a song and then
you go back to talking again.

1899
00:51:54,570 --> 00:51:54,831
You're like,

1900
00:51:54,831 --> 00:51:57,800
what is this fucking commercial
thing you guys are doing?

1901
00:51:58,130 --> 00:52:00,260
Because how many of those
can you do in an hour?

1902
00:52:00,261 --> 00:52:01,880
If you've got seven and then
you've got another time,

1903
00:52:02,030 --> 00:52:02,190
well,

1904
00:52:02,190 --> 00:52:04,790
you got a half an hour worth of
fucking commercials in an hour.

1905
00:52:04,940 --> 00:52:05,960
That's crazy.

1906
00:52:06,380 --> 00:52:08,380
But it's almost getting
to that point with,

1907
00:52:08,430 --> 00:52:10,010
with a lot of these radio stations,

1908
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:11,720
they just have so much.

1909
00:52:11,721 --> 00:52:11,961
Man,

1910
00:52:11,961 --> 00:52:12,920
it's so crazy.

1911
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:14,271
Yeah.

1912
00:52:14,271 --> 00:52:15,440
I do it out of pure,

1913
00:52:15,441 --> 00:52:15,980
uh,

1914
00:52:15,980 --> 00:52:17,780
how easy it is in my car.

1915
00:52:17,781 --> 00:52:18,051
You know,

1916
00:52:18,051 --> 00:52:18,391
it's just,

1917
00:52:18,391 --> 00:52:19,161
she turned the car,

1918
00:52:19,161 --> 00:52:20,060
the radio turns on.

1919
00:52:20,060 --> 00:52:20,451
You don't have,

1920
00:52:20,451 --> 00:52:20,691
you know,

1921
00:52:20,691 --> 00:52:22,640
it's kind of like
background noise to a point.

1922
00:52:22,710 --> 00:52:22,951
Yeah.

1923
00:52:22,951 --> 00:52:24,470
That's the only reason
I listened to radio.

1924
00:52:24,471 --> 00:52:28,890
If it gets to the point where it just
automatically turns on my Spotify my card,

1925
00:52:28,891 --> 00:52:30,890
then I will,

1926
00:52:31,220 --> 00:52:31,730
you know,

1927
00:52:31,730 --> 00:52:33,860
serious is so much better in that sense.

1928
00:52:33,861 --> 00:52:35,660
Like when I listened to opiod Jimmy,

1929
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:36,800
it's like they're swearing,

1930
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:38,840
they're being honest and swearing.

1931
00:52:38,841 --> 00:52:40,850
But even then you have to
worry about being fired.

1932
00:52:41,270 --> 00:52:45,380
They have to worry about some sort of a
public outrage situation when they say

1933
00:52:45,381 --> 00:52:48,600
something crazy and people
demand their ouster and the,

1934
00:52:48,601 --> 00:52:51,320
the heads will roll and the
corporation has to bow down.

1935
00:52:51,530 --> 00:52:51,861
Well,

1936
00:52:51,861 --> 00:52:52,161
you know,

1937
00:52:52,161 --> 00:52:52,520
we've,

1938
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:57,290
we've reviewed your file and we've found
that this is not the first time you

1939
00:52:57,291 --> 00:52:58,520
said anything outrageous.

1940
00:52:59,030 --> 00:52:59,591
Anthony Ku,

1941
00:52:59,591 --> 00:53:00,200
Mia,

1942
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:00,411
you know,

1943
00:53:00,411 --> 00:53:00,570
like,

1944
00:53:00,570 --> 00:53:01,970
well that's what he got paid for,

1945
00:53:02,430 --> 00:53:02,721
you know,

1946
00:53:02,721 --> 00:53:03,231
and they were like,

1947
00:53:03,231 --> 00:53:04,064
you're out.

1948
00:53:04,130 --> 00:53:07,650
Like he tweeted a bunch of
horrible shit where really the,

1949
00:53:07,710 --> 00:53:09,800
the great thing would be to do,

1950
00:53:09,950 --> 00:53:14,950
to have him come in and justify what he
said or explain himself or apologize on

1951
00:53:16,911 --> 00:53:20,840
the air or say he was drunk or address
it the way he would have dressed it.

1952
00:53:21,530 --> 00:53:22,730
And if he did do that,

1953
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:24,380
the fucking ratings would be giant.

1954
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:26,680
Like if they were smart about their,

1955
00:53:26,681 --> 00:53:27,480
their business,

1956
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:28,380
the business model,

1957
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:29,580
that's how they would handle it.

1958
00:53:29,790 --> 00:53:29,851
Uh,

1959
00:53:29,851 --> 00:53:30,121
you,

1960
00:53:30,121 --> 00:53:32,850
you've got a builtin
ratings boost right there.

1961
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:34,140
Let people talk more about it.

1962
00:53:34,230 --> 00:53:35,580
Have people bitch more.

1963
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:35,891
Well,

1964
00:53:35,891 --> 00:53:36,930
you should do is tweet some.

1965
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:37,890
You should.

1966
00:53:37,890 --> 00:53:41,130
You should have a sock puppet account
where you tweet some of the other

1967
00:53:41,131 --> 00:53:43,770
outrageous shit that he said
over the past five years.

1968
00:53:43,950 --> 00:53:45,350
She has just spam it,

1969
00:53:45,460 --> 00:53:46,293
spam it out.

1970
00:53:47,580 --> 00:53:48,720
It's only going to help.

1971
00:53:49,020 --> 00:53:51,780
It's only going to help is going
to get more people pissed off.

1972
00:53:51,810 --> 00:53:52,201
Yes.

1973
00:53:52,201 --> 00:53:53,940
Is it going to get more people to call up?

1974
00:53:53,941 --> 00:53:54,231
Your said,

1975
00:53:54,231 --> 00:53:55,470
we're gonna cancel serious.

1976
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:56,940
Are you really?

1977
00:53:57,150 --> 00:53:58,380
If that's all it takes,

1978
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:00,120
it's all it takes for
you to cancel serious.

1979
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:01,410
Fuck off.

1980
00:54:01,590 --> 00:54:02,730
Get out of here.

1981
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:07,880
One guy says a few retarded things after
he gets drunk and some stripper or a

1982
00:54:08,671 --> 00:54:09,091
hooker.

1983
00:54:09,091 --> 00:54:09,924
I guess she was a hooker.

1984
00:54:09,990 --> 00:54:13,650
Beats him up while he's holding a gun
and he doesn't do anything about it like,

1985
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:13,951
come on.

1986
00:54:13,951 --> 00:54:14,880
It's a great story.

1987
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:17,430
If that's what's going to
get you to quit serious,

1988
00:54:17,770 --> 00:54:18,870
think go quit bitch.

1989
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:20,100
They need to be able to say that.

1990
00:54:20,130 --> 00:54:20,963
Go quit.

1991
00:54:22,170 --> 00:54:23,040
It's a dead model.

1992
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:24,073
Yeah.

1993
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:26,670
That's a just a better
version of the dead model.

1994
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:27,810
What they are as like,

1995
00:54:28,530 --> 00:54:29,880
they're like a Betamax.

1996
00:54:30,750 --> 00:54:32,250
Like the VHS was doomed.

1997
00:54:32,290 --> 00:54:33,420
Didn't even know it was doomed.

1998
00:54:33,421 --> 00:54:37,610
It was like a little bridge before we
can get to digital media and the Beta was

1999
00:54:37,620 --> 00:54:38,453
just better.

2000
00:54:38,850 --> 00:54:40,140
It's like a better bridge.

2001
00:54:40,220 --> 00:54:41,580
Beta Max was way better,

2002
00:54:41,730 --> 00:54:43,530
better quality in wars,

2003
00:54:43,590 --> 00:54:45,480
but more in a laserdisc even better.

2004
00:54:45,570 --> 00:54:46,670
That's even better than DVD.

2005
00:54:47,210 --> 00:54:48,043
How about Blueray?

2006
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:49,290
Blue Egg can go fuck itself.

2007
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:50,870
How about that cause you,

2008
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:51,870
it's so amazing.

2009
00:54:51,871 --> 00:54:52,590
Look at the quality.

2010
00:54:52,590 --> 00:54:53,250
Good.

2011
00:54:53,250 --> 00:54:54,360
Good luck with it too.

2012
00:54:54,690 --> 00:54:55,441
Why would I get that?

2013
00:54:55,441 --> 00:54:58,380
I could stream movies instantly and
don't I have to hold your stupid Frisbee?

2014
00:54:58,410 --> 00:54:59,160
Sure.

2015
00:54:59,160 --> 00:54:59,880
It's done.

2016
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:00,713
It's over.

2017
00:55:01,140 --> 00:55:03,630
It's like they got us to that.

2018
00:55:03,690 --> 00:55:04,650
They got us to that,

2019
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:06,840
but you can't do that anymore like that.

2020
00:55:07,290 --> 00:55:09,150
That model doesn't work anymore.

2021
00:55:09,990 --> 00:55:14,990
The model of a like broadcasting shit
randomly through the air and you tune it

2022
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:16,980
in she,

2023
00:55:17,340 --> 00:55:18,000
oh I got the,

2024
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,020
I got it on the dial.

2025
00:55:19,110 --> 00:55:19,920
Here it is.

2026
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:21,390
Unless the apocalypse hits,

2027
00:55:21,510 --> 00:55:22,860
that's fucking stupid.

2028
00:55:23,220 --> 00:55:23,551
You know,

2029
00:55:23,551 --> 00:55:24,420
just stop.

2030
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:27,270
Everybody's got their own station.

2031
00:55:27,770 --> 00:55:29,680
Remember with Christian Slater had a,

2032
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:34,050
he was a rebel and he broadcasted
even though he wasn't supposed to,

2033
00:55:34,290 --> 00:55:36,900
he was like turn it up
or something like that.

2034
00:55:36,901 --> 00:55:40,980
Turned the radio and whatever the fuck
that's stupid movie was called pump up

2035
00:55:40,981 --> 00:55:41,814
the volume.

2036
00:55:44,690 --> 00:55:45,900
That's what he was doing.

2037
00:55:45,990 --> 00:55:46,690
What he was doing.

2038
00:55:46,690 --> 00:55:49,470
Was it just a really low rent podcast?

2039
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:50,940
You know he was,

2040
00:55:51,030 --> 00:55:52,590
I'm going to play real music,

2041
00:55:52,591 --> 00:55:53,160
man.

2042
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:55,760
I'm going to say what I think
we're going to chase you up.

2043
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:56,161
No,

2044
00:55:56,161 --> 00:55:56,994
you're not.

2045
00:55:57,080 --> 00:55:58,560
Doesn't change the world podcast.

2046
00:55:58,561 --> 00:55:59,520
Don't change the world.

2047
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:02,700
Nothing serious radio being able to
sweat it doesn't change the world.

2048
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:03,713
They get mites.

2049
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:07,140
The culture is slowly going to devolve
when people are allowed to communicate

2050
00:56:07,141 --> 00:56:07,830
with each other.

2051
00:56:07,830 --> 00:56:10,260
But the idea that like one guy's
going to start a revolution.

2052
00:56:10,350 --> 00:56:12,270
I'm going to tell the
truth with my radio show.

2053
00:56:12,570 --> 00:56:13,403
Listen Buddy,

2054
00:56:13,650 --> 00:56:14,483
it's not going to happen.

2055
00:56:14,490 --> 00:56:16,260
Your bone structure is too perfect.

2056
00:56:16,550 --> 00:56:19,170
You have wonderful hair and
the movie you're in sucks.

2057
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:20,370
This is crazy.

2058
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:21,910
I just had a flashback.

2059
00:56:22,620 --> 00:56:23,920
Phoned his big ass.

2060
00:56:24,370 --> 00:56:25,420
That's a cordless phone.

2061
00:56:25,421 --> 00:56:26,201
That's not even a,

2062
00:56:26,201 --> 00:56:27,010
um,

2063
00:56:27,010 --> 00:56:29,410
that's supposed to be like some
satellite phone or some shit like that.

2064
00:56:30,310 --> 00:56:32,390
I guess that's supposed to
be a cell phone right now.

2065
00:56:32,610 --> 00:56:33,280
I don't know.

2066
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:33,940
Yeah,

2067
00:56:33,940 --> 00:56:35,680
I guess that's supposed to
be like one of those early.

2068
00:56:35,890 --> 00:56:38,580
That's like a really cool
version of the early cell phone,

2069
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:40,240
high school kids listening to his show.

2070
00:56:40,570 --> 00:56:40,901
Yeah,

2071
00:56:40,901 --> 00:56:41,141
man,

2072
00:56:41,141 --> 00:56:42,430
he was changing the world with those kids.

2073
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:46,120
I bet a lot of people listen
to this podcast and uh,

2074
00:56:46,121 --> 00:56:47,380
their parents find out about it.

2075
00:56:47,381 --> 00:56:47,910
Will you,

2076
00:56:47,910 --> 00:56:52,570
you better get that off your phone
that Joe Rogan in his marijuana talk,

2077
00:56:52,750 --> 00:56:53,710
get it off your phone.

2078
00:56:53,830 --> 00:56:55,780
He doesn't even believe in our Lord.

2079
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:57,401
Have you seen,

2080
00:56:57,401 --> 00:56:57,790
uh,

2081
00:56:57,790 --> 00:56:58,660
not that I don't,

2082
00:56:58,710 --> 00:56:59,543
it's not true.

2083
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:01,330
I don't not believe in God.

2084
00:57:01,420 --> 00:57:03,610
I don't disbelieve in God.

2085
00:57:03,730 --> 00:57:04,563
Just to be clear.

2086
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:05,380
I don't,

2087
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:06,670
I've seen no evidence.

2088
00:57:07,070 --> 00:57:07,480
Um,

2089
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:09,640
it'd be seen Manny Pacquiao
was Instagram page though.

2090
00:57:09,700 --> 00:57:10,030
No,

2091
00:57:10,030 --> 00:57:10,863
it's wonderful.

2092
00:57:11,050 --> 00:57:11,920
He's got a picture.

2093
00:57:11,950 --> 00:57:13,480
It's one of the goofiest pictures.

2094
00:57:13,660 --> 00:57:15,230
If you thought Dane Cook's Instagrammers,

2095
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:20,280
a hoot I need to go to go to Manny
Pacquiao was Instagram and uh,

2096
00:57:21,001 --> 00:57:21,610
see,

2097
00:57:21,610 --> 00:57:23,140
see what's going on with this dude.

2098
00:57:23,210 --> 00:57:25,340
I have a huge Dane Cook Instagram fetish.

2099
00:57:27,550 --> 00:57:29,110
Make his name famous.

2100
00:57:29,290 --> 00:57:30,970
Make Jesus name famous.

2101
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:31,953
Wow.

2102
00:57:32,020 --> 00:57:32,590
That's,

2103
00:57:32,590 --> 00:57:34,720
and it says glorify apparel.

2104
00:57:34,810 --> 00:57:38,170
So apparently this is
like a real shirt company.

2105
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:43,680
Like if these are the people that
like worked for American apparel,

2106
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:47,800
but they got head injuries on the job
and they decided to form their own

2107
00:57:47,801 --> 00:57:49,120
business with their,

2108
00:57:49,121 --> 00:57:49,954
uh,

2109
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:52,240
the money that they were
getting from it looks like it.

2110
00:57:52,241 --> 00:57:52,600
Got It.

2111
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:53,200
You're,

2112
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:56,470
you're a store lids made it,

2113
00:57:56,620 --> 00:57:57,760
it looks really basic.

2114
00:57:57,761 --> 00:58:01,240
Looks like it like a moss shirt that you
could just get printed out in like 30

2115
00:58:01,241 --> 00:58:01,690
minutes.

2116
00:58:01,690 --> 00:58:02,710
I was trying to say something,

2117
00:58:02,711 --> 00:58:03,940
I couldn't remember
what I was going to say.

2118
00:58:04,750 --> 00:58:05,650
I was trying to rent that.

2119
00:58:05,651 --> 00:58:07,210
Brian American apparel,

2120
00:58:07,270 --> 00:58:07,750
whatever.

2121
00:58:07,750 --> 00:58:08,201
Head injury,

2122
00:58:08,201 --> 00:58:08,830
head injury,

2123
00:58:08,830 --> 00:58:10,210
make his name famous.

2124
00:58:10,211 --> 00:58:10,810
Look at that.

2125
00:58:10,810 --> 00:58:11,643
Oh,

2126
00:58:14,220 --> 00:58:15,360
she's just like what?

2127
00:58:15,990 --> 00:58:16,823
That's it.

2128
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:18,630
So this is all advertising for the salt.

2129
00:58:18,631 --> 00:58:19,200
Jesus.

2130
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:20,190
It's all Jesus people.

2131
00:58:21,510 --> 00:58:22,343
Hilarious.

2132
00:58:23,130 --> 00:58:25,350
Do you remember on TVs
where it used to have,

2133
00:58:25,380 --> 00:58:27,700
I just had like a
flashback it on our race.

2134
00:58:27,750 --> 00:58:29,730
What does that grace upon grace.

2135
00:58:29,731 --> 00:58:30,690
That's some lesbian shit.

2136
00:58:31,350 --> 00:58:32,183
Great sound great.

2137
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:33,113
You can't do that.

2138
00:58:34,030 --> 00:58:34,300
Is that,

2139
00:58:34,300 --> 00:58:35,133
what did it say that

2140
00:58:39,810 --> 00:58:42,030
that's like having a shirt that
says let Jesus come inside you.

2141
00:58:43,110 --> 00:58:45,000
You can't even though I
know what you're saying,

2142
00:58:45,030 --> 00:58:46,610
you can't adopt it with the fuck.

2143
00:58:46,611 --> 00:58:47,760
Is that so what were you saying?

2144
00:58:48,420 --> 00:58:49,210
I just had a flashback.

2145
00:58:49,210 --> 00:58:50,370
Remember on old TVs,

2146
00:58:50,450 --> 00:58:50,980
uh,

2147
00:58:50,980 --> 00:58:52,200
where you snap a Knob,

2148
00:58:52,201 --> 00:58:54,870
but then he had that knob that was in
the middle of the knob where you used to

2149
00:58:54,871 --> 00:58:56,260
find tune the channels.

2150
00:58:56,420 --> 00:58:59,720
We turn it to like channel four and
then you had this other night I forgot.

2151
00:59:01,140 --> 00:59:01,973
Yeah.

2152
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:03,330
Yeah.

2153
00:59:03,330 --> 00:59:08,330
And then there was a
UHF and VHF and UHF VHF.

2154
00:59:09,390 --> 00:59:10,900
UHF was like the,

2155
00:59:10,930 --> 00:59:13,260
the one of them was
like the good channels.

2156
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:13,770
Right.

2157
00:59:13,770 --> 00:59:15,930
And the other one was like
Benny Hill and am radio.

2158
00:59:18,540 --> 00:59:20,880
Remember Benny Hill
wasn't on the regular TV.

2159
00:59:20,881 --> 00:59:21,350
It,

2160
00:59:21,350 --> 00:59:22,340
he was on the bullshit

2161
00:59:22,700 --> 00:59:23,533
networks.

2162
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:25,970
I forgot all about that though.

2163
00:59:26,780 --> 00:59:27,613
I did too.

2164
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:28,970
Yeah,

2165
00:59:28,970 --> 00:59:29,803
I do too.

2166
00:59:30,580 --> 00:59:31,040
There's a whole,

2167
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:33,530
there's a fucking hilarious
harm movie called VHS.

2168
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:37,820
It's like one of those found
footage ones where these people,

2169
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:40,520
but the first one is
actually pretty fucking cool.

2170
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:42,500
It's one of those movies like God damn it,

2171
00:59:42,501 --> 00:59:43,760
if you could keep this up,

2172
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:46,130
if you could keep this up
through the whole movie,

2173
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:48,830
it'll be pretty bad ass cause
it's a bunch of stories.

2174
00:59:49,070 --> 00:59:49,910
And the first one,

2175
00:59:49,940 --> 00:59:51,470
spoiler alert,

2176
00:59:51,740 --> 00:59:55,340
the first one is about a girl who's a
demon and this guy picks his girl up at a

2177
00:59:55,341 --> 00:59:56,720
club but she uh,

2178
00:59:56,750 --> 01:00:00,020
she turns out to be a demon but
it's actually like really well done.

2179
01:00:00,140 --> 01:00:00,590
It's kind of,

2180
01:00:00,590 --> 01:00:01,430
it's freaky.

2181
01:00:01,610 --> 01:00:05,960
They're drunk and they pick her up and
she's got like these really weird feet

2182
01:00:06,020 --> 01:00:07,820
and then they realize like
something's wrong with her.

2183
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,680
But she keeps telling
them that she loves him,

2184
01:00:09,681 --> 01:00:10,281
she loves him.

2185
01:00:10,281 --> 01:00:10,491
It's,

2186
01:00:10,491 --> 01:00:11,390
it's really good.

2187
01:00:11,810 --> 01:00:14,060
But it's only like
watch it for 20 minutes,

2188
01:00:14,061 --> 01:00:16,970
watch that first one and then throw
that fucking thing out the window.

2189
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,080
If you have an actual copy,

2190
01:00:18,610 --> 01:00:19,520
a physical copy,

2191
01:00:19,550 --> 01:00:20,383
Blu Ray,

2192
01:00:20,950 --> 01:00:22,010
do you have a blue ray?

2193
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:27,980
That was the other thing is they fucked
up with their protocol battles with like

2194
01:00:27,981 --> 01:00:32,510
blue ray and I have a bunch
of DVDs that are HD DVDs.

2195
01:00:32,511 --> 01:00:33,740
You can't watch on anything.

2196
01:00:34,130 --> 01:00:35,120
I got a bunch of them.

2197
01:00:35,121 --> 01:00:36,170
I got a player if you want.

2198
01:00:37,130 --> 01:00:38,000
I don't even,

2199
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:39,980
you could get them all on digital now,

2200
01:00:40,370 --> 01:00:41,203
but that's,

2201
01:00:41,210 --> 01:00:42,043
see,

2202
01:00:42,290 --> 01:00:45,320
that'll be the demise of our knowledge.

2203
01:00:45,710 --> 01:00:47,990
That's what's going to happen if,

2204
01:00:48,230 --> 01:00:49,190
if you just look,

2205
01:00:49,700 --> 01:00:51,710
if you pay attention to what,

2206
01:00:51,711 --> 01:00:52,061
when,

2207
01:00:52,061 --> 01:00:55,070
when people talk about the
possibilities of natural disasters,

2208
01:00:55,071 --> 01:00:59,000
like somebody just posted this on the
message board the other day that a America

2209
01:00:59,030 --> 01:01:00,070
is basically a,

2210
01:01:00,090 --> 01:01:01,340
a ticking time bomb.

2211
01:01:01,340 --> 01:01:03,110
It's based on some article
that someone wrote.

2212
01:01:03,111 --> 01:01:04,460
Maybe I'll pull it up real quick,

2213
01:01:04,790 --> 01:01:05,300
but uh,

2214
01:01:05,300 --> 01:01:06,490
it was based on CVE.

2215
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:07,333
Find the Jamie,

2216
01:01:07,490 --> 01:01:09,140
but I think it's in the,

2217
01:01:09,141 --> 01:01:09,890
um,

2218
01:01:09,890 --> 01:01:12,590
the main form might be
in the podcast form,

2219
01:01:12,950 --> 01:01:17,900
but the idea was that there's this
giant culture of entitled people.

2220
01:01:18,110 --> 01:01:22,100
Nobody knows how to do
anything for self sustaining.

2221
01:01:22,340 --> 01:01:24,080
Nobody knows how to grow their own food.

2222
01:01:24,081 --> 01:01:25,430
Nobody knows how to get water.

2223
01:01:25,850 --> 01:01:29,060
And we live in these
giant population centers.

2224
01:01:29,061 --> 01:01:30,920
America is a bomb waiting to explode.

2225
01:01:30,921 --> 01:01:31,754
That's it.

2226
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:32,660
And uh,

2227
01:01:32,660 --> 01:01:34,760
it makes them really fucking good points.

2228
01:01:34,970 --> 01:01:35,541
Like when you,

2229
01:01:35,541 --> 01:01:36,470
when you go over it,

2230
01:01:36,471 --> 01:01:37,730
it makes some really good points.

2231
01:01:37,731 --> 01:01:41,810
It's kind of freaky when you stop and
think about how many different things we

2232
01:01:41,811 --> 01:01:46,610
rely on that are hanging by a thread
that easily could be taken out by a power

2233
01:01:46,611 --> 01:01:47,300
grid.

2234
01:01:47,300 --> 01:01:49,280
But when you think about our knowledge,

2235
01:01:49,820 --> 01:01:50,780
if we do,

2236
01:01:50,781 --> 01:01:52,010
if something does happen,

2237
01:01:52,011 --> 01:01:55,850
a solar flare or asteroid
impact that wipes out,

2238
01:01:55,880 --> 01:01:58,970
say 20% of the population stops the power.

2239
01:01:58,970 --> 01:02:00,050
And Man,

2240
01:02:00,080 --> 01:02:00,560
if,

2241
01:02:00,560 --> 01:02:02,300
if all of our shit breaks,

2242
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:04,580
if we lost half the people on earth,

2243
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:07,190
if all of our shit stops working,

2244
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:09,380
computer stop working and we really,

2245
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:12,890
we have to live like the early settlers,

2246
01:02:12,950 --> 01:02:14,270
like people are still alive.

2247
01:02:14,450 --> 01:02:17,180
The people that are alive
today still have the,

2248
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:21,270
the knowledge that they have
of live in 30 plus years with,

2249
01:02:21,500 --> 01:02:21,870
you know,

2250
01:02:21,870 --> 01:02:26,010
the education system and all the
technology that's in place today.

2251
01:02:26,340 --> 01:02:27,720
These people still out stop.

2252
01:02:27,870 --> 01:02:29,280
These people still have those things.

2253
01:02:29,281 --> 01:02:30,114
Right?

2254
01:02:31,110 --> 01:02:31,943
How,

2255
01:02:32,130 --> 01:02:32,963
how much,

2256
01:02:33,390 --> 01:02:35,040
how long could you use what we have?

2257
01:02:35,250 --> 01:02:36,140
Like how long could you,

2258
01:02:36,141 --> 01:02:37,110
well you don't have any power,

2259
01:02:37,290 --> 01:02:38,850
how are you gonna be
able to generate power?

2260
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:40,170
Some people might be able to,

2261
01:02:40,350 --> 01:02:44,370
they might be like a few people with
propane generators and still work and some

2262
01:02:44,371 --> 01:02:48,990
people might be figuring out how to
rig solar or create batteries are used,

2263
01:02:48,991 --> 01:02:49,980
the batteries that we have,

2264
01:02:49,981 --> 01:02:54,981
but all large scale industrial
shit would be stopped.

2265
01:02:56,070 --> 01:02:59,250
All construction and manufacturing
would cease and desist.

2266
01:02:59,700 --> 01:03:04,080
And then all of our knowledge that's on
these fucking computers and hard drives

2267
01:03:04,230 --> 01:03:05,250
in accessible.

2268
01:03:05,380 --> 01:03:08,830
When I was at a and Ohio a couple
of years ago for Christmas break,

2269
01:03:08,950 --> 01:03:09,400
uh,

2270
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:11,890
maybe for about a week there
is a really bad winter storm,

2271
01:03:11,891 --> 01:03:12,551
like an ice storm.

2272
01:03:12,551 --> 01:03:16,390
Homeless and power was out almost for
the large part of the state for almost an

2273
01:03:16,391 --> 01:03:17,320
entire whole week.

2274
01:03:17,630 --> 01:03:18,640
I thought about that recently.

2275
01:03:18,641 --> 01:03:19,540
If that happened here,

2276
01:03:19,750 --> 01:03:20,920
even for three days,

2277
01:03:21,310 --> 01:03:22,630
this place would almost fall apart.

2278
01:03:22,631 --> 01:03:24,100
If there is no power in Los Angeles,

2279
01:03:24,460 --> 01:03:25,270
a couple of days,

2280
01:03:25,270 --> 01:03:26,410
people are so soft

2281
01:03:26,670 --> 01:03:27,710
is fuck here.

2282
01:03:27,711 --> 01:03:28,251
First of all,

2283
01:03:28,251 --> 01:03:29,240
soft as fuck.

2284
01:03:29,450 --> 01:03:30,283
Second of all,

2285
01:03:30,320 --> 01:03:31,610
they wouldn't be able to keep food.

2286
01:03:31,740 --> 01:03:32,810
The difference between Ohio,

2287
01:03:32,820 --> 01:03:36,020
you could put your food out in the
garage and it's cold as shit and it would

2288
01:03:36,060 --> 01:03:36,430
stay,

2289
01:03:36,430 --> 01:03:37,430
stay cold out there.

2290
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:38,211
You,

2291
01:03:38,211 --> 01:03:38,810
uh,

2292
01:03:38,810 --> 01:03:40,490
in the wintertime out here,

2293
01:03:40,491 --> 01:03:43,160
it's still 70 degrees and your
food's gonna rot in a day.

2294
01:03:45,540 --> 01:03:46,351
In that article,

2295
01:03:46,351 --> 01:03:51,270
he said one of the things that is
holding on by a thread is the use of mine

2296
01:03:51,271 --> 01:03:52,260
altering drugs.

2297
01:03:52,261 --> 01:03:53,160
What was that all about?

2298
01:03:53,160 --> 01:03:53,480
Oh,

2299
01:03:53,480 --> 01:03:53,870
I dunno,

2300
01:03:53,870 --> 01:03:54,920
I didn't read the whole thing.

2301
01:03:55,040 --> 01:03:55,311
Maybe,

2302
01:03:55,311 --> 01:03:58,910
probably if you talk about
antidepressants number three,

2303
01:03:59,780 --> 01:04:01,370
FDA approved narcotics.

2304
01:04:01,430 --> 01:04:01,940
Yeah,

2305
01:04:01,940 --> 01:04:04,300
well there's a lot of
that re uptake in he,

2306
01:04:04,301 --> 01:04:04,940
yeah.

2307
01:04:04,940 --> 01:04:07,610
Selective Serotonin reuptake inhibitors,

2308
01:04:07,611 --> 01:04:08,444
Ssri,

2309
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:10,090
those are antidepressants.

2310
01:04:11,260 --> 01:04:16,260
Pop US population was up 400% of
late two thousands over the 1990s.

2311
01:04:16,790 --> 01:04:21,230
Many of these drugs are selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors.

2312
01:04:21,860 --> 01:04:24,020
These are the type the
FDA approved narcotics,

2313
01:04:24,021 --> 01:04:26,120
lone gunmen are frequently
associated with,

2314
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:27,433
you know,

2315
01:04:27,500 --> 01:04:31,610
that's so true that there's a giant
percentage of people that wind up shooting

2316
01:04:31,611 --> 01:04:34,070
people that are on antidepressants.

2317
01:04:34,460 --> 01:04:36,080
But in all fairness,

2318
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:36,381
you know,

2319
01:04:36,381 --> 01:04:36,891
there's that,

2320
01:04:36,891 --> 01:04:37,724
um,

2321
01:04:37,970 --> 01:04:38,751
causation,

2322
01:04:38,751 --> 01:04:41,210
causality paradigm like that.

2323
01:04:41,211 --> 01:04:41,510
Co,

2324
01:04:41,510 --> 01:04:42,050
you know,

2325
01:04:42,050 --> 01:04:44,540
causation does not equal causality.

2326
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:49,280
The idea that something happening
like just because these two things are

2327
01:04:49,340 --> 01:04:50,390
combined together,

2328
01:04:50,391 --> 01:04:52,070
it doesn't mean that
thing caused that thing.

2329
01:04:52,250 --> 01:04:54,470
And there's other factors
that you have to prove.

2330
01:04:54,770 --> 01:04:56,630
I know people are saying your
butcher in that right now.

2331
01:04:56,690 --> 01:04:57,620
I know I'm butchering it,

2332
01:04:57,950 --> 01:05:00,060
but there's other factors
that people have to um,

2333
01:05:00,350 --> 01:05:01,340
take into consideration.

2334
01:05:01,550 --> 01:05:05,360
One of the big factors is why was the guy
on antidepressants in the first place?

2335
01:05:05,361 --> 01:05:08,090
Why was the guy on antipsychotic
medication in the first place?

2336
01:05:08,360 --> 01:05:08,931
If he's on it,

2337
01:05:08,931 --> 01:05:10,550
it doesn't mean the
medication made him do that.

2338
01:05:10,551 --> 01:05:13,550
And it might be mean he's fucking
crazy and that's why he's taking shit.

2339
01:05:13,551 --> 01:05:15,230
And that's why eventually
wound up killing somebody.

2340
01:05:15,560 --> 01:05:16,730
But it could be that too.

2341
01:05:16,990 --> 01:05:18,340
It could be that.

2342
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:23,380
And it also could be that the SSRS with
certain people have an effect that makes

2343
01:05:23,381 --> 01:05:25,510
them less likely to feel,

2344
01:05:25,660 --> 01:05:26,080
they don't,

2345
01:05:26,080 --> 01:05:26,470
they don't,

2346
01:05:26,470 --> 01:05:29,860
they don't freak out about stuff as much
and it might make things acceptable to

2347
01:05:29,861 --> 01:05:30,430
them,

2348
01:05:30,430 --> 01:05:31,630
including violence.

2349
01:05:31,670 --> 01:05:31,890
That's,

2350
01:05:31,890 --> 01:05:32,681
that's the rub.

2351
01:05:32,681 --> 01:05:33,850
That's the scary thing.

2352
01:05:34,570 --> 01:05:36,960
Especially if you combine
them with other shit like a,

2353
01:05:36,970 --> 01:05:38,380
I know Phil Hartman's family,

2354
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:43,560
they won money from Zoloft because
Zoloft allegedly I wasn't there.

2355
01:05:43,751 --> 01:05:44,501
And when the court happened,

2356
01:05:44,501 --> 01:05:44,770
I might,

2357
01:05:44,770 --> 01:05:47,440
I have to say allegedly was
what I read on the Internet.

2358
01:05:48,340 --> 01:05:49,510
I'm pretty sure it's the case though,

2359
01:05:50,170 --> 01:05:50,951
because she was,

2360
01:05:50,951 --> 01:05:51,340
uh,

2361
01:05:51,340 --> 01:05:53,020
doing Zoloft when she shot him.

2362
01:05:53,350 --> 01:05:57,070
And that if you take Zoloft and you
combine it with recreational drugs,

2363
01:05:57,071 --> 01:05:59,320
especially alcohol and cocaine,

2364
01:05:59,890 --> 01:06:03,610
especially cocaine is supposed to make
you like really nutty when you're,

2365
01:06:03,611 --> 01:06:03,850
uh,

2366
01:06:03,850 --> 01:06:05,560
doing coke and Ssri is,

2367
01:06:05,561 --> 01:06:08,440
it's like very crazy combination.

2368
01:06:09,030 --> 01:06:09,331
Yeah.

2369
01:06:09,331 --> 01:06:09,680
And if,

2370
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:10,350
you know,

2371
01:06:10,350 --> 01:06:14,010
we run out of depression
pills or happy pills,

2372
01:06:14,340 --> 01:06:14,731
we're going to,

2373
01:06:14,731 --> 01:06:16,380
you don't really see that in the movies,

2374
01:06:16,381 --> 01:06:20,800
like a half the people are just going
crazy and angry and depressed and sad.

2375
01:06:21,210 --> 01:06:22,620
You certainly could happen and it,

2376
01:06:22,621 --> 01:06:23,454
the road movies,

2377
01:06:23,560 --> 01:06:24,041
but you know,

2378
01:06:24,041 --> 01:06:24,310
I'm,

2379
01:06:24,310 --> 01:06:26,500
I'm worried about all
that I'm worried about.

2380
01:06:26,501 --> 01:06:27,070
It's not like,

2381
01:06:27,070 --> 01:06:27,341
well,

2382
01:06:27,341 --> 01:06:29,680
you should know what you need
to be worried about is this,

2383
01:06:29,890 --> 01:06:30,161
you know,

2384
01:06:30,161 --> 01:06:31,480
people love to make that argument.

2385
01:06:31,481 --> 01:06:31,571
Well,

2386
01:06:31,571 --> 01:06:32,530
you're missing the point.

2387
01:06:32,531 --> 01:06:33,400
The point is this.

2388
01:06:33,580 --> 01:06:33,821
No,

2389
01:06:33,821 --> 01:06:34,960
that's also the point.

2390
01:06:35,260 --> 01:06:35,590
There's,

2391
01:06:35,590 --> 01:06:35,891
you know,

2392
01:06:35,891 --> 01:06:38,230
the world's not a black and white thing.

2393
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:40,240
The world has a lot of points.

2394
01:06:40,241 --> 01:06:45,070
There's a lot of areas that we need to
look at when it comes to the way human

2395
01:06:45,100 --> 01:06:48,970
life is operating today and what we were
required to keep it operating at this

2396
01:06:48,971 --> 01:06:49,804
level.

2397
01:06:49,900 --> 01:06:52,990
We need a lot of shit to think about
what we need to run this podcast.

2398
01:06:53,560 --> 01:06:53,921
You know,

2399
01:06:53,921 --> 01:06:58,000
we were talking about how it's such as
small shoestring organization cause it's

2400
01:06:58,001 --> 01:06:58,600
just,

2401
01:06:58,600 --> 01:06:59,080
you know,

2402
01:06:59,080 --> 01:07:02,290
just the three of us in this room
and it's reaching all these people,

2403
01:07:02,710 --> 01:07:05,320
but you still need like
Libson these still need,

2404
01:07:05,350 --> 01:07:05,621
you know,

2405
01:07:05,621 --> 01:07:08,950
you need like hosts and you
need websites and you need,

2406
01:07:09,250 --> 01:07:11,550
you need the fiber optic to be laid.

2407
01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:12,070
You need the,

2408
01:07:12,070 --> 01:07:12,430
the,

2409
01:07:12,430 --> 01:07:14,350
the ability to transmit.

2410
01:07:14,351 --> 01:07:15,310
You need electricity.

2411
01:07:15,311 --> 01:07:17,440
This like a lot of shit
that has to be in play.

2412
01:07:17,590 --> 01:07:19,090
And then when the power goes out,

2413
01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:21,610
all of it stops.

2414
01:07:21,910 --> 01:07:22,601
All of it stops.

2415
01:07:22,601 --> 01:07:25,030
And the power goes out
for a year or two years.

2416
01:07:25,330 --> 01:07:27,250
We might as well be living in Mad Max.

2417
01:07:27,780 --> 01:07:28,840
And that's a fact.

2418
01:07:28,930 --> 01:07:31,030
That's a fucking fact.

2419
01:07:31,270 --> 01:07:35,200
When people started getting desperate
and their kids don't have any food and

2420
01:07:35,201 --> 01:07:37,000
we're trying to figure out how to get gas,

2421
01:07:37,160 --> 01:07:37,610
Whoa,

2422
01:07:37,610 --> 01:07:38,710
shit is going to get ugly.

2423
01:07:39,130 --> 01:07:39,970
You better pack.

2424
01:07:40,120 --> 01:07:41,290
If they say,

2425
01:07:41,320 --> 01:07:42,101
ladies and gentlemen,

2426
01:07:42,101 --> 01:07:45,400
prepare for at least a year of no power,

2427
01:07:45,790 --> 01:07:49,180
you got a fucking head north immediately.

2428
01:07:49,210 --> 01:07:51,610
I mean fucking immediately.

2429
01:07:51,820 --> 01:07:53,680
I don't care what the
traffic jams are like,

2430
01:07:53,710 --> 01:07:54,910
get out of here.

2431
01:07:55,180 --> 01:07:56,170
Get out of here.

2432
01:07:56,200 --> 01:07:57,700
Get out of here while you can.

2433
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:00,700
You gotta get the fuck
away from this powder keg.

2434
01:08:00,701 --> 01:08:05,200
Cause there's a lot of really dumb people
here and a lot of poor people and a

2435
01:08:05,201 --> 01:08:07,030
lot of crime that,

2436
01:08:07,060 --> 01:08:07,450
you know,

2437
01:08:07,450 --> 01:08:07,931
what are you gonna do?

2438
01:08:07,931 --> 01:08:10,540
They're gonna keep the people in jail
and make them starve to death the fuck

2439
01:08:10,541 --> 01:08:10,931
they are.

2440
01:08:10,931 --> 01:08:14,080
They going to open those doors and Whoa,

2441
01:08:15,710 --> 01:08:15,980
having

2442
01:08:15,980 --> 01:08:18,280
enough gas to get out of
here to live somewhere.

2443
01:08:18,980 --> 01:08:20,880
It might even work that
might not even work.

2444
01:08:20,970 --> 01:08:21,803
Yeah.

2445
01:08:22,020 --> 01:08:26,370
It's just this is a terrible place to be
if everything stops because there's too

2446
01:08:26,371 --> 01:08:29,670
many people and there's too many food
requirements and it's too many entitled

2447
01:08:30,030 --> 01:08:31,050
dumb dumbs here.

2448
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:33,960
There's too many people that would
just fuck it up for everybody.

2449
01:08:33,961 --> 01:08:35,580
When you look at things like the riots,

2450
01:08:35,910 --> 01:08:37,080
like the riots that happened,

2451
01:08:37,620 --> 01:08:38,453
granted,

2452
01:08:38,720 --> 01:08:40,460
they were reacting to uh,

2453
01:08:41,110 --> 01:08:41,450
uh,

2454
01:08:41,450 --> 01:08:41,581
uh,

2455
01:08:41,581 --> 01:08:45,420
really in their mind a really
important moment where Rodney King,

2456
01:08:45,630 --> 01:08:46,140
you know,

2457
01:08:46,140 --> 01:08:47,550
got beat up by these cops.

2458
01:08:47,580 --> 01:08:52,580
They saw one segment of a very long car
chase and a prolonged fight with the

2459
01:08:53,491 --> 01:08:54,210
cops,

2460
01:08:54,210 --> 01:08:57,540
but in the segment they saw these cops
are beating that guy with the fucking

2461
01:08:57,541 --> 01:08:58,290
club.

2462
01:08:58,290 --> 01:08:59,250
The beaten the shit out of him.

2463
01:08:59,251 --> 01:08:59,731
They got to quit.

2464
01:08:59,731 --> 01:08:59,851
It's,

2465
01:08:59,851 --> 01:09:00,684
everybody went nuts,

2466
01:09:00,780 --> 01:09:04,560
but they went nuts against people
that had nothing to do with it.

2467
01:09:04,920 --> 01:09:06,960
They went nuts with people like they,

2468
01:09:06,961 --> 01:09:09,990
when they pulled that Reginald gent Denny
out of the car and hit him in the head

2469
01:09:09,991 --> 01:09:11,190
with a brick on TV,

2470
01:09:11,340 --> 01:09:12,510
I'll never forget that.

2471
01:09:12,720 --> 01:09:12,930
She's,

2472
01:09:12,930 --> 01:09:14,730
that guy's out there right now,

2473
01:09:14,820 --> 01:09:15,653
that guy,

2474
01:09:15,750 --> 01:09:17,040
there's a guy like that guy,

2475
01:09:17,070 --> 01:09:20,040
whether it's that guy or
specifically or a guy like him,

2476
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:24,090
he's out there right now waiting
for the green light waiting for it.

2477
01:09:24,120 --> 01:09:25,290
And there's a lot of them.

2478
01:09:25,380 --> 01:09:26,430
There's a lot of them.

2479
01:09:26,850 --> 01:09:28,920
And when there's no food man,

2480
01:09:28,921 --> 01:09:30,060
no food and no water,

2481
01:09:30,290 --> 01:09:30,601
they are,

2482
01:09:30,601 --> 01:09:35,040
those are not good combinations and no
gasoline to get the food or water to

2483
01:09:35,041 --> 01:09:35,874
here.

2484
01:09:36,420 --> 01:09:37,253
Whoa.

2485
01:09:37,290 --> 01:09:38,123
Good luck.

2486
01:09:39,180 --> 01:09:40,590
So all this shit that we have,

2487
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:41,461
you know,

2488
01:09:41,461 --> 01:09:41,731
we're,

2489
01:09:41,731 --> 01:09:44,010
we're so amazed that our progress,

2490
01:09:44,130 --> 01:09:44,550
we're done.

2491
01:09:44,550 --> 01:09:45,810
We've done such an amazing job.

2492
01:09:45,811 --> 01:09:46,141
Yeah,

2493
01:09:46,141 --> 01:09:46,974
definitely.

2494
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:48,330
But it could all go away.

2495
01:09:48,750 --> 01:09:50,220
It could go away real quick.

2496
01:09:50,830 --> 01:09:54,120
We're putting too much important things
on our phones and our electronics.

2497
01:09:54,121 --> 01:09:56,790
Like if my phone dies right now
and all the electricity goes out,

2498
01:09:56,791 --> 01:09:58,170
I don't have numbers to my,

2499
01:09:58,260 --> 01:09:59,910
my friends and my family.

2500
01:09:59,911 --> 01:10:01,920
I don't have any ways to contact them,

2501
01:10:01,921 --> 01:10:02,100
you know,

2502
01:10:02,100 --> 01:10:04,230
or personal information and yeah,

2503
01:10:04,380 --> 01:10:05,550
I might know 10 numbers.

2504
01:10:05,580 --> 01:10:06,150
Right.

2505
01:10:06,150 --> 01:10:07,020
I don't even know that.

2506
01:10:07,260 --> 01:10:07,571
Really.

2507
01:10:07,571 --> 01:10:07,671
And,

2508
01:10:07,671 --> 01:10:08,360
and,

2509
01:10:08,360 --> 01:10:09,180
and the other thing,

2510
01:10:09,180 --> 01:10:11,970
like I had my mom bought me
one of those big medical books.

2511
01:10:12,120 --> 01:10:12,301
You know,

2512
01:10:12,301 --> 01:10:14,130
that's something that you
don't even think about.

2513
01:10:14,131 --> 01:10:16,710
Like if we have no internet
and you get an infection,

2514
01:10:17,010 --> 01:10:17,341
you know,

2515
01:10:17,341 --> 01:10:18,330
like you should know,

2516
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:18,601
Oh,

2517
01:10:18,601 --> 01:10:20,460
poor alcohol and if
you don't have alcohol,

2518
01:10:20,461 --> 01:10:21,270
pee on it and you know,

2519
01:10:21,270 --> 01:10:22,410
or whatever you have to do.

2520
01:10:22,500 --> 01:10:22,860
You know,

2521
01:10:22,860 --> 01:10:24,600
I'm watching the showtime show,

2522
01:10:24,601 --> 01:10:28,290
the Nick Who's seen that
showtime does some crazy shit,

2523
01:10:28,291 --> 01:10:28,531
man.

2524
01:10:28,531 --> 01:10:29,364
They have to,

2525
01:10:29,610 --> 01:10:30,600
they're like playboy.

2526
01:10:31,020 --> 01:10:32,960
Like nobody gives a
fuck about them anymore.

2527
01:10:32,961 --> 01:10:35,010
They've got to do something
gangster to get noticed.

2528
01:10:35,820 --> 01:10:36,620
And uh,

2529
01:10:36,620 --> 01:10:36,891
it's,

2530
01:10:36,891 --> 01:10:38,280
it's so graphic.

2531
01:10:38,670 --> 01:10:39,420
The guys,

2532
01:10:39,420 --> 01:10:39,811
first of all,

2533
01:10:39,811 --> 01:10:40,860
it's totally unrealistic.

2534
01:10:40,861 --> 01:10:43,920
Like the guys suffering from
massive cocaine withdrawals.

2535
01:10:43,921 --> 01:10:44,191
I just,

2536
01:10:44,191 --> 01:10:46,350
whole body's going to
convulsions is about to die.

2537
01:10:46,740 --> 01:10:48,810
Every vein in his body's collapsed.

2538
01:10:48,840 --> 01:10:49,890
So she's got to try to find,

2539
01:10:49,891 --> 01:10:53,160
the nurse has to try to find a
new vein to shoot cocaine into.

2540
01:10:53,490 --> 01:10:55,740
And once she does shoot
the vein and he's fine,

2541
01:10:55,950 --> 01:10:59,040
now he's up in talking
swift and knows his stuff.

2542
01:10:59,130 --> 01:11:00,240
He's the best.

2543
01:11:00,330 --> 01:11:01,710
This is what we're going to do.

2544
01:11:01,860 --> 01:11:03,600
I'll accept your resignation.

2545
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:04,231
You know,

2546
01:11:04,231 --> 01:11:05,460
like they like the way they,

2547
01:11:05,490 --> 01:11:05,761
you know,

2548
01:11:05,761 --> 01:11:07,020
they do these operations,

2549
01:11:07,021 --> 01:11:08,610
he's like this mastermind genius.

2550
01:11:08,610 --> 01:11:13,610
But five minutes ago he was just spasming
and flailing because he couldn't get

2551
01:11:14,821 --> 01:11:16,830
his cocaine and all his
veins are collapsed.

2552
01:11:17,190 --> 01:11:18,780
They shoot it into him and now he's fine.

2553
01:11:19,610 --> 01:11:21,120
Can you see what's going on with homeland?

2554
01:11:21,900 --> 01:11:22,790
It's kind of hilarious.

2555
01:11:22,791 --> 01:11:25,470
And you were watched the artists
that worked for homeland,

2556
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:27,300
they wrote shit in Arabic.

2557
01:11:27,720 --> 01:11:32,720
How about homeland is a stupid show
about our homeland is Islamophobic and a

2558
01:11:33,060 --> 01:11:34,140
homeland is,

2559
01:11:34,380 --> 01:11:34,980
yeah.

2560
01:11:34,980 --> 01:11:35,221
Yeah.

2561
01:11:35,221 --> 01:11:35,751
Find that.

2562
01:11:35,751 --> 01:11:36,230
It's kind of,

2563
01:11:36,230 --> 01:11:36,901
it kind of interesting.

2564
01:11:36,901 --> 01:11:37,740
See if you can find the APP,

2565
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:38,970
the actual images.

2566
01:11:39,180 --> 01:11:40,080
But what they did is,

2567
01:11:40,081 --> 01:11:40,261
you know,

2568
01:11:40,261 --> 01:11:41,094
the artists were,

2569
01:11:41,160 --> 01:11:45,000
they were supposed to put
images in the background.

2570
01:11:45,150 --> 01:11:45,391
You know,

2571
01:11:45,391 --> 01:11:47,050
they create these environments.

2572
01:11:47,051 --> 01:11:51,840
They're supposed to look like Bangladesh
or Nepal or wherever the fuck they want

2573
01:11:51,841 --> 01:11:52,051
to be.

2574
01:11:52,051 --> 01:11:52,800
Right.

2575
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:54,930
And when they have Arabic writing,

2576
01:11:54,931 --> 01:11:58,020
they have to bring in an artist
to write the Arabic writing.

2577
01:11:58,350 --> 01:12:01,890
And what I tell these people are just
writing shit cause they know that these

2578
01:12:01,891 --> 01:12:06,510
dummies can't read Arabic and they're
not checking or double checking and

2579
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:07,500
apparently,

2580
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:08,160
um,

2581
01:12:08,160 --> 01:12:10,560
they get shit wrong all the time,

2582
01:12:10,620 --> 01:12:14,130
accusing homeland of racism
appearing in the latest episode.

2583
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:19,440
Apparently they get shit wrong
about like alliances and conflicts.

2584
01:12:19,441 --> 01:12:21,810
They make stuff up in order
to make the show better.

2585
01:12:22,140 --> 01:12:22,973
Wow.

2586
01:12:23,370 --> 01:12:28,260
The artist hired add authenticity
to a refugee scene shot in Germany.

2587
01:12:28,261 --> 01:12:32,910
Also scrawled messages as homeland is
a joke and it didn't make us laugh.

2588
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:35,940
That's hilarious.

2589
01:12:37,110 --> 01:12:39,630
We will get super sensitive
about shows like that.

2590
01:12:39,810 --> 01:12:40,643
You know,

2591
01:12:40,680 --> 01:12:41,640
you're dealing with,

2592
01:12:41,641 --> 01:12:42,474
um,

2593
01:12:43,140 --> 01:12:48,140
a war torn world that specifically focuses
on the most war torn aspects of the

2594
01:12:49,861 --> 01:12:50,640
world.

2595
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:55,640
All the places where the United States
has military and they're battling

2596
01:12:55,800 --> 01:12:58,860
fundamentalists having these,

2597
01:12:58,861 --> 01:12:59,430
these,

2598
01:12:59,430 --> 01:12:59,731
you know,

2599
01:12:59,731 --> 01:13:02,850
these scenes and they're putting them
in these fictional shows and they're

2600
01:13:02,851 --> 01:13:06,510
butchering the conflicts and
there when you do stuff like that,

2601
01:13:06,511 --> 01:13:06,870
man,

2602
01:13:06,870 --> 01:13:09,300
like if you're doing a
show about game of Thrones,

2603
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:10,770
you can do whatever the fuck you want.

2604
01:13:10,771 --> 01:13:13,200
You know the seven kingdoms
and you'd have dragons.

2605
01:13:13,500 --> 01:13:16,560
You know it's like Natasha is
Sheryl calls to make 'em ups.

2606
01:13:16,780 --> 01:13:17,071
She,

2607
01:13:17,071 --> 01:13:18,540
she doesn't like it cause it's like make,

2608
01:13:18,620 --> 01:13:19,453
it's a make them up.

2609
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:24,800
But what I don't like about this kind of
a show is like if you're fucking around

2610
01:13:24,871 --> 01:13:27,060
with the reality and if you,

2611
01:13:27,061 --> 01:13:31,410
if you twist the conflicts and you
twist the alliances and you twist the,

2612
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:34,920
the actual historical events
in order to make your,

2613
01:13:34,950 --> 01:13:35,251
your,

2614
01:13:35,251 --> 01:13:37,110
your show like more smooth.

2615
01:13:37,410 --> 01:13:40,470
The problem is people who
are watching that show,

2616
01:13:40,471 --> 01:13:41,520
we're going to believe you.

2617
01:13:41,860 --> 01:13:45,780
Like I know you're pretending that it's
is like this is just fiction but it's

2618
01:13:45,781 --> 01:13:48,090
about real parts of the world.

2619
01:13:48,840 --> 01:13:50,340
They should have like the
thing at the beginning,

2620
01:13:50,341 --> 01:13:52,770
like the following program is yeah.

2621
01:13:53,430 --> 01:13:56,550
Cause Yeah I would watch that
and think about the beginning.

2622
01:13:56,560 --> 01:13:57,930
You can tune in the middle.

2623
01:13:58,170 --> 01:13:58,471
You know,

2624
01:13:58,471 --> 01:13:59,161
you come in,

2625
01:13:59,161 --> 01:14:00,090
you just took a shit.

2626
01:14:00,120 --> 01:14:01,290
It's five minutes in.

2627
01:14:01,291 --> 01:14:01,471
Yeah,

2628
01:14:01,471 --> 01:14:02,370
I'll pay attention to this.

2629
01:14:02,720 --> 01:14:03,001
You know,

2630
01:14:03,001 --> 01:14:03,250
and you,

2631
01:14:03,250 --> 01:14:06,180
you missed all that stuff where
they told you this bullshit,

2632
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:07,350
but you know,

2633
01:14:07,351 --> 01:14:11,190
they'll make stuff up in order to make
their show more interesting or march

2634
01:14:11,191 --> 01:14:12,024
dramatic.

2635
01:14:12,820 --> 01:14:13,653
What are you doing over there?

2636
01:14:13,830 --> 01:14:14,390
Uh,

2637
01:14:14,390 --> 01:14:19,390
did you see the new technology where like
me and you could be sitting in a room

2638
01:14:19,701 --> 01:14:24,200
next to each other in the TV and I can
make you talk by using my facial features

2639
01:14:24,201 --> 01:14:24,710
and stuff.

2640
01:14:24,710 --> 01:14:26,480
You mean you can make the image of me?

2641
01:14:26,481 --> 01:14:26,720
Yeah.

2642
01:14:26,720 --> 01:14:27,560
Image of you talk.

2643
01:14:27,580 --> 01:14:28,413
How,

2644
01:14:28,490 --> 01:14:29,730
I mean that's a game changer.

2645
01:14:29,731 --> 01:14:29,930
Yeah.

2646
01:14:29,930 --> 01:14:30,770
It's pretty freaky.

2647
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:31,520
Do you have that link?

2648
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:32,440
I got this a,

2649
01:14:32,550 --> 01:14:33,500
I can just send this to you,

2650
01:14:33,710 --> 01:14:34,380
but yeah,

2651
01:14:34,380 --> 01:14:38,840
cause that like in the future we could
be watching Obama on the TV and it

2652
01:14:38,841 --> 01:14:40,640
wouldn't even be him talking,

2653
01:14:40,670 --> 01:14:41,450
you know,

2654
01:14:41,450 --> 01:14:42,430
it wouldn't be,

2655
01:14:42,500 --> 01:14:44,750
I had him making those facial expressions.

2656
01:14:44,751 --> 01:14:47,090
You can manipulate the image
of someone's facial expression.

2657
01:14:47,300 --> 01:14:47,930
Like I could,

2658
01:14:47,930 --> 01:14:51,950
I could make you have duck lips and
make you raise your eyebrows and,

2659
01:14:52,220 --> 01:14:54,740
and it would literally just alter your,

2660
01:14:54,830 --> 01:14:57,880
you're the face of your image to
match the expressions that I'm making.

2661
01:14:58,040 --> 01:14:58,340
Right.

2662
01:14:58,340 --> 01:15:01,880
Or if I wanted to have a voice,

2663
01:15:02,060 --> 01:15:02,893
you know,

2664
01:15:03,020 --> 01:15:03,890
a copy of it.

2665
01:15:03,891 --> 01:15:07,340
Like I can like say what can
I have another technology
where I can have you say

2666
01:15:07,341 --> 01:15:11,090
a few words and then have a mimic
voice that sounds exactly like you.

2667
01:15:11,450 --> 01:15:11,871
So then I,

2668
01:15:11,871 --> 01:15:13,150
in the future I can have a,

2669
01:15:13,480 --> 01:15:18,080
you look like you are saying something
and be completely just a program or two

2670
01:15:18,110 --> 01:15:20,480
that are working on your
voice and your face.

2671
01:15:20,540 --> 01:15:20,721
Well,

2672
01:15:20,721 --> 01:15:21,370
what they've done it

2673
01:15:21,370 --> 01:15:26,230
past is they've spliced together little
snippets of stuff to make it seem like

2674
01:15:26,231 --> 01:15:29,200
someone was saying something like
they did that with Ronald Reagan,

2675
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:32,470
Ronald Reagan during his administration.

2676
01:15:32,530 --> 01:15:33,040
He,

2677
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:35,790
he gave some speech and uh,

2678
01:15:36,040 --> 01:15:36,850
somebody,

2679
01:15:36,850 --> 01:15:38,050
some bad people.

2680
01:15:38,051 --> 01:15:38,890
So we're in the world.

2681
01:15:39,460 --> 01:15:43,880
They took his speech and they chopped
it up and made it some other broadcast.

2682
01:15:43,881 --> 01:15:46,000
Then broadcast it to people
all around the world saying,

2683
01:15:46,001 --> 01:15:48,010
this is how evil Ronald Reagan is.

2684
01:15:48,310 --> 01:15:50,110
But then they showed it on television.

2685
01:15:50,170 --> 01:15:53,050
I remember they showed
all the different pieces.

2686
01:15:53,250 --> 01:15:56,200
I think of that target reenacted.

2687
01:15:56,530 --> 01:15:57,700
It's pretty close.

2688
01:15:59,680 --> 01:16:00,071
Wow.

2689
01:16:00,071 --> 01:16:00,904
It's so weird.

2690
01:16:01,060 --> 01:16:05,500
We're looking at a source actor who's
on the left and then we're looking at a

2691
01:16:05,501 --> 01:16:07,240
guy on the right who's the,

2692
01:16:07,241 --> 01:16:08,074
uh,

2693
01:16:08,170 --> 01:16:09,330
the CGI.

2694
01:16:10,150 --> 01:16:10,720
Like there's this,

2695
01:16:10,720 --> 01:16:13,000
there's a guy who is the,

2696
01:16:13,001 --> 01:16:13,091
uh,

2697
01:16:13,091 --> 01:16:15,730
the guy has got no expression whatsoever.

2698
01:16:15,970 --> 01:16:17,800
And then there's a guy
who's manipulating him,

2699
01:16:17,801 --> 01:16:19,600
who sits above him in the frame.

2700
01:16:19,900 --> 01:16:22,750
And as he makes these
expressions in the frame,

2701
01:16:22,751 --> 01:16:23,950
the guy on the left,

2702
01:16:23,980 --> 01:16:25,090
like that guy in the left,

2703
01:16:25,180 --> 01:16:25,531
his,

2704
01:16:25,531 --> 01:16:25,930
uh,

2705
01:16:25,930 --> 01:16:26,290
his,

2706
01:16:26,290 --> 01:16:28,210
his face,

2707
01:16:28,420 --> 01:16:29,800
even though he's not moving at all,

2708
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:34,920
his face in the image is doing the
exact same things that the other guy is.

2709
01:16:35,081 --> 01:16:36,670
And what's interesting is like,

2710
01:16:36,700 --> 01:16:40,680
it's sort of seems to be accounting for
the size and shape of your face too.

2711
01:16:42,160 --> 01:16:43,620
Like the size of his lips.

2712
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:45,990
Like you see like the one
guy as the bigger lips,

2713
01:16:46,230 --> 01:16:47,480
the guy above him look at,

2714
01:16:47,500 --> 01:16:50,430
he's got them big Ole Angelina Jolie Lips.

2715
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:52,350
But to do it in the bottom
you've got some paper,

2716
01:16:52,351 --> 01:16:52,680
lips,

2717
01:16:52,680 --> 01:16:53,580
white people lips,

2718
01:16:54,180 --> 01:16:56,300
but the paper lips or what's moving.

2719
01:16:56,320 --> 01:16:57,153
See,

2720
01:16:57,270 --> 01:16:57,901
it's interesting,

2721
01:16:57,901 --> 01:16:58,734
right?

2722
01:16:59,820 --> 01:17:01,500
Like it's not that guys lips,

2723
01:17:02,250 --> 01:17:04,260
it's the guy below him is the,

2724
01:17:04,261 --> 01:17:04,770
the,

2725
01:17:04,770 --> 01:17:05,880
the guy who is not moving at all.

2726
01:17:05,881 --> 01:17:10,820
They're actually using his facial features
and like the of his facial features.

2727
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:12,200
It's really weird.

2728
01:17:13,270 --> 01:17:13,430
Yeah.

2729
01:17:13,430 --> 01:17:15,440
You're not gonna be able to
trust shit in the future.

2730
01:17:15,530 --> 01:17:16,190
Definitely not.

2731
01:17:16,190 --> 01:17:16,760
Yeah.

2732
01:17:16,760 --> 01:17:17,001
I mean,

2733
01:17:17,001 --> 01:17:18,320
it's probably already happened.

2734
01:17:18,350 --> 01:17:20,220
We just don't know me.

2735
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:22,250
If we're watching this on youtube,

2736
01:17:22,370 --> 01:17:23,870
what does the CIA have right now?

2737
01:17:23,890 --> 01:17:24,190
Yeah.

2738
01:17:24,190 --> 01:17:24,860
You know,

2739
01:17:24,860 --> 01:17:25,041
I mean,

2740
01:17:25,041 --> 01:17:25,310
they,

2741
01:17:25,310 --> 01:17:26,570
they must have some insane shit.

2742
01:17:27,410 --> 01:17:27,891
By the way,

2743
01:17:27,891 --> 01:17:28,880
speaking of the CIA,

2744
01:17:29,250 --> 01:17:29,720
uh,

2745
01:17:29,720 --> 01:17:34,720
Neil degrasse Tyson talked to Edward
Snowden for a two episodes of is a star

2746
01:17:34,941 --> 01:17:35,930
talk podcast.

2747
01:17:36,170 --> 01:17:37,250
It's a must listen,

2748
01:17:37,460 --> 01:17:38,450
so I'm must listen.

2749
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:39,313
It's amazing.

2750
01:17:39,440 --> 01:17:42,950
Fresnel Snowden's a lot fucking smarter
than I thought it was because I remember

2751
01:17:42,951 --> 01:17:44,360
I'm thinking like,

2752
01:17:44,390 --> 01:17:45,120
wow,

2753
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:45,980
like this guy,

2754
01:17:46,100 --> 01:17:50,150
like he was a high school dropout and
all of a sudden he's working for the NSA

2755
01:17:50,151 --> 01:17:50,990
and you know,

2756
01:17:50,991 --> 01:17:52,250
or the CIA or whatever.

2757
01:17:52,251 --> 01:17:54,500
He was working for gathering data.

2758
01:17:54,501 --> 01:17:55,940
Like why don't they let
a high school drama?

2759
01:17:56,210 --> 01:17:56,780
But then you,

2760
01:17:56,780 --> 01:18:00,560
you hear a story and you realize what
he actually did wind up going to college

2761
01:18:00,561 --> 01:18:02,600
and did wind up going to school and just,

2762
01:18:02,630 --> 01:18:04,700
he would just had to kind
of a tumultuous slide.

2763
01:18:04,701 --> 01:18:07,400
But he was working for the
NSA when he was like 16.

2764
01:18:07,820 --> 01:18:09,170
Like he's a super genius.

2765
01:18:09,370 --> 01:18:09,831
I'm just his,

2766
01:18:09,831 --> 01:18:11,870
he didn't graduate from high school.

2767
01:18:12,020 --> 01:18:13,130
When you listen to him talk,

2768
01:18:13,131 --> 01:18:18,131
he's very fucking smart and he's very
well read and understands exactly what the

2769
01:18:19,581 --> 01:18:22,970
problems with all of
this technology and this,

2770
01:18:22,971 --> 01:18:23,660
uh,

2771
01:18:23,660 --> 01:18:24,920
uncheck surveillance.

2772
01:18:25,130 --> 01:18:25,281
I mean,

2773
01:18:25,281 --> 01:18:26,114
he's a hero.

2774
01:18:26,210 --> 01:18:26,411
Well,

2775
01:18:26,411 --> 01:18:27,000
that I,

2776
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:27,560
I don't,

2777
01:18:27,560 --> 01:18:28,070
you know,

2778
01:18:28,070 --> 01:18:30,890
I know some people have
differing opinions on him,

2779
01:18:31,310 --> 01:18:31,581
but he,

2780
01:18:31,581 --> 01:18:36,581
that guy enlightened us to the activities
of the government that what they were

2781
01:18:37,161 --> 01:18:38,360
doing something that was illegal.

2782
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:41,720
They were doing something that 99% of
people are going to have a real problem

2783
01:18:41,721 --> 01:18:44,720
with spying on people that
haven't done anything wrong,

2784
01:18:45,740 --> 01:18:47,690
and it's a,

2785
01:18:47,700 --> 01:18:49,640
it's fascinating to listen to him talk.

2786
01:18:50,390 --> 01:18:53,120
He also had some really interesting
shit to say about aliens,

2787
01:18:53,900 --> 01:18:55,160
which I thought was really crazy.

2788
01:18:55,580 --> 01:18:58,760
He was like in a really complex,

2789
01:18:59,060 --> 01:19:00,740
super advanced society.

2790
01:19:00,980 --> 01:19:02,600
They're going to have compressed data,

2791
01:19:03,200 --> 01:19:06,740
like everything's going to be compressed
and everything's going to be encrypted,

2792
01:19:07,220 --> 01:19:09,380
and when you have compressed
and encrypted data,

2793
01:19:09,381 --> 01:19:11,750
it's going to be indistinguishable
from background noise.

2794
01:19:12,250 --> 01:19:13,790
It's like you're not going to
know what you're listening to.

2795
01:19:14,210 --> 01:19:18,710
So if you're listening to like some
super advanced aliens communications and

2796
01:19:18,711 --> 01:19:19,970
you're catching them through the air,

2797
01:19:20,660 --> 01:19:22,550
good luck trying to figure
out what that is like.

2798
01:19:22,550 --> 01:19:26,900
They're not broadcasting like unless
they're trying to reach us using our own

2799
01:19:26,901 --> 01:19:27,860
primitive methods.

2800
01:19:28,070 --> 01:19:29,870
They're not broadcasting
like that anymore.

2801
01:19:30,200 --> 01:19:30,680
Like they're,

2802
01:19:30,680 --> 01:19:33,380
if they're advanced enough so they
can get here from another planet,

2803
01:19:33,650 --> 01:19:37,250
most likely they're encrypting
everything and everything is,

2804
01:19:37,370 --> 01:19:38,150
you know,

2805
01:19:38,150 --> 01:19:38,920
it's kind of we're,

2806
01:19:38,920 --> 01:19:39,800
we're going to hear it.

2807
01:19:40,010 --> 01:19:41,450
It's going to sound like background noise.

2808
01:19:41,451 --> 01:19:42,830
We're not going to know
what the fuck it is,

2809
01:19:43,250 --> 01:19:44,840
but to them it's going to be,

2810
01:19:44,900 --> 01:19:45,201
you know,

2811
01:19:45,201 --> 01:19:49,280
it's going to go into their super advanced
systems and it will be clear as day

2812
01:19:49,730 --> 01:19:53,990
what to us it's like trying to send an
internet signal to someone who was on the

2813
01:19:53,991 --> 01:19:56,540
Santa Maria back in the Columbus days.

2814
01:19:56,541 --> 01:19:56,871
They'd be like,

2815
01:19:56,871 --> 01:19:57,770
what the fuck you doing?

2816
01:19:57,860 --> 01:19:58,820
I sent you the email,

2817
01:19:59,930 --> 01:20:01,160
you sent me the email.

2818
01:20:01,190 --> 01:20:02,240
I'm on a boat here.

2819
01:20:02,241 --> 01:20:03,230
I'm getting scurvy.

2820
01:20:03,350 --> 01:20:03,781
What do you mean?

2821
01:20:03,781 --> 01:20:04,041
He said,

2822
01:20:04,041 --> 01:20:05,060
what the fuck's in email?

2823
01:20:05,061 --> 01:20:05,894
What are you talking about?

2824
01:20:05,930 --> 01:20:06,131
Dude?

2825
01:20:06,131 --> 01:20:06,770
Check your phone.

2826
01:20:06,770 --> 01:20:07,603
Check my what?

2827
01:20:07,860 --> 01:20:08,040
Like

2828
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:09,390
they won't even know what
you're talking about.

2829
01:20:09,391 --> 01:20:09,960
Right?

2830
01:20:09,960 --> 01:20:11,670
Well you think about what that is.

2831
01:20:11,671 --> 01:20:12,120
Think of that,

2832
01:20:12,120 --> 01:20:16,260
that sort of electronic communication
that just a few hundred years ago is

2833
01:20:16,261 --> 01:20:20,370
completely alien and out of the question
to the point where they would not be

2834
01:20:20,371 --> 01:20:23,160
able to even conceptualize
what you're saying.

2835
01:20:23,370 --> 01:20:25,260
Have you tried to explain
something to them?

2836
01:20:25,470 --> 01:20:28,860
My friend keeps sending me
these Dick pics a phone.

2837
01:20:29,010 --> 01:20:29,401
He'd be like,

2838
01:20:29,401 --> 01:20:31,140
what the fuck are you talking about?

2839
01:20:31,320 --> 01:20:36,320
Now think of that and now extrapolate to
a society that's a thousand years more

2840
01:20:37,111 --> 01:20:39,780
advanced than us or a million
years more advanced than us.

2841
01:20:40,170 --> 01:20:45,170
And it's the same sort of lack of ability
to recognize what they're doing unless

2842
01:20:46,530 --> 01:20:50,310
the technology and the
science was so good,

2843
01:20:50,311 --> 01:20:53,400
how it should be that there
was like a downgrade a bubble.

2844
01:20:53,490 --> 01:20:55,410
Like it detects our language and goes,

2845
01:20:55,411 --> 01:20:55,801
okay,

2846
01:20:55,801 --> 01:21:00,801
this is English around the year 2015 I
will now convert it to a understandable,

2847
01:21:01,230 --> 01:21:01,561
you know,

2848
01:21:01,561 --> 01:21:04,830
communication like well that's if they
were trying to communicate with us.

2849
01:21:04,830 --> 01:21:05,641
That's what I said earlier.

2850
01:21:05,641 --> 01:21:08,820
If they chose to send
something non encrypted,

2851
01:21:09,090 --> 01:21:11,550
but the problem is they're going to
be communicating with each other.

2852
01:21:11,910 --> 01:21:14,100
It's like if we chose to talk to someone,

2853
01:21:14,130 --> 01:21:14,700
if we could,

2854
01:21:14,700 --> 01:21:17,400
we had a time machine and
we can go back to Columbus.

2855
01:21:17,640 --> 01:21:19,590
We would get him a scroll,

2856
01:21:19,880 --> 01:21:20,370
you know,

2857
01:21:20,370 --> 01:21:21,750
and it would have some writing on it.

2858
01:21:21,751 --> 01:21:22,371
We could do that.

2859
01:21:22,371 --> 01:21:25,140
It'd be easy as fuck if we actually
wanted to communicate with them.

2860
01:21:25,530 --> 01:21:30,300
But if Columbus was out there in the
middle of the fucking ocean and he didn't

2861
01:21:30,301 --> 01:21:33,990
know he had five bars on his phone
and he didn't know his awesome Wifi.

2862
01:21:34,270 --> 01:21:35,550
W He has no idea.

2863
01:21:35,820 --> 01:21:36,720
He's just out there.

2864
01:21:36,810 --> 01:21:37,830
There's nothing out here.

2865
01:21:38,070 --> 01:21:38,581
What do I do?

2866
01:21:38,581 --> 01:21:39,241
I'm on my own.

2867
01:21:39,241 --> 01:21:40,080
You're not on your own pitch.

2868
01:21:40,081 --> 01:21:40,890
Plot your phone.

2869
01:21:40,890 --> 01:21:41,850
He doesn't have a phone.

2870
01:21:41,970 --> 01:21:43,920
So like the,

2871
01:21:44,340 --> 01:21:49,340
the ability to do something in the future
might be completely outside of our,

2872
01:21:49,850 --> 01:21:54,360
our imagination right now are completely
outside of our comprehension front page

2873
01:21:54,361 --> 01:21:55,530
of CNN right now.

2874
01:21:55,620 --> 01:21:56,280
Uh,

2875
01:21:56,280 --> 01:21:57,840
supposedly some high school kids,

2876
01:21:57,900 --> 01:21:58,130
uh,

2877
01:21:58,130 --> 01:21:58,680
hacked,

2878
01:21:58,680 --> 01:21:58,891
uh,

2879
01:21:58,891 --> 01:22:02,160
the private accounts of CIA
and homeland security chiefs.

2880
01:22:02,670 --> 01:22:03,503
Yeah.

2881
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:04,760
And did you hear where he was doing?

2882
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:05,850
They hacked his account.

2883
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:10,530
He was on fucking all these old men.

2884
01:22:10,590 --> 01:22:10,891
Yeah.

2885
01:22:10,891 --> 01:22:11,880
These old fucks.

2886
01:22:11,881 --> 01:22:12,990
We need to get them out.

2887
01:22:13,290 --> 01:22:15,360
Get outta here grandpa.

2888
01:22:15,690 --> 01:22:16,920
Get outta here grandpa.

2889
01:22:17,040 --> 01:22:17,873
Oh my God.

2890
01:22:18,300 --> 01:22:20,040
Search your file

2891
01:22:23,730 --> 01:22:24,690
file.

2892
01:22:25,350 --> 01:22:26,430
Excuse me.

2893
01:22:26,580 --> 01:22:28,620
It was on the American.

2894
01:22:28,621 --> 01:22:29,700
What is AOL stand for?

2895
01:22:29,701 --> 01:22:32,600
America Online America Online.

2896
01:22:32,790 --> 01:22:34,800
It is a giant corporation.

2897
01:22:34,940 --> 01:22:37,650
I have never heard of them
being hacked in the past.

2898
01:22:38,370 --> 01:22:42,750
AOL email account associated
with Brennan that included,

2899
01:22:43,470 --> 01:22:44,303
what does it say?

2900
01:22:44,370 --> 01:22:49,290
Included files regarding your security
was security clearance application and

2901
01:22:49,291 --> 01:22:53,700
the hacker also claims to have access
to Comcast account associated with

2902
01:22:53,701 --> 01:22:54,390
Johnson.

2903
01:22:54,390 --> 01:22:55,860
Another old man,

2904
01:22:56,640 --> 01:22:57,540
another old man.

2905
01:22:57,541 --> 01:23:00,330
It doesn't know what the fuck is
going on with the world of technology.

2906
01:23:00,360 --> 01:23:01,380
God dammit.

2907
01:23:01,430 --> 01:23:01,600
Hey.

2908
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:02,433
Oh Man,

2909
01:23:02,550 --> 01:23:06,040
what the fuck is that guy
running the fucking secret

2910
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:08,590
service CIA director.

2911
01:23:09,190 --> 01:23:10,023
That's what he is.

2912
01:23:11,200 --> 01:23:12,400
Jesus Christ.

2913
01:23:14,040 --> 01:23:15,860
I wonder if that was just like his email.

2914
01:23:15,950 --> 01:23:20,040
Look at these two guys
probably picked up dudes.

2915
01:23:20,280 --> 01:23:22,220
Look at their two positions.

2916
01:23:22,280 --> 01:23:26,540
The CIA director and the
Director of Homeland Security,

2917
01:23:28,010 --> 01:23:29,270
Jesus Christ,

2918
01:23:29,980 --> 01:23:32,630
the Department of Homeland
Security Secretary,

2919
01:23:33,260 --> 01:23:34,400
but Jesus Christ,

2920
01:23:34,610 --> 01:23:35,300
those are,

2921
01:23:35,300 --> 01:23:37,040
those are fucking big people.

2922
01:23:37,220 --> 01:23:37,820
That's,

2923
01:23:37,820 --> 01:23:38,061
you know,

2924
01:23:38,061 --> 01:23:39,770
that's not the guy who was the plumber.

2925
01:23:40,970 --> 01:23:41,121
Oh,

2926
01:23:41,121 --> 01:23:41,980
the guy who was the plumber.

2927
01:23:41,990 --> 01:23:43,550
The CIA still use AOL.

2928
01:23:43,551 --> 01:23:48,551
Tell him he can't tell him to get
on the edu or what would they have?

2929
01:23:49,161 --> 01:23:49,700
G.

2930
01:23:49,700 --> 01:23:49,701
Dot.

2931
01:23:49,701 --> 01:23:54,701
Gov Email list along with fucking
Hillary Clinton that control in it for

2932
01:23:54,771 --> 01:23:55,540
everybody.

2933
01:23:55,540 --> 01:24:00,540
Which a private emails Hillary Clinton
and just see what's said in her email.

2934
01:24:01,490 --> 01:24:01,821
Well,

2935
01:24:01,821 --> 01:24:03,140
they got ahold of her emails,

2936
01:24:03,141 --> 01:24:03,381
you know,

2937
01:24:03,381 --> 01:24:04,011
because they were,

2938
01:24:04,011 --> 01:24:04,790
um,

2939
01:24:04,790 --> 01:24:06,920
they were concerned that she was
emailing from a private account.

2940
01:24:07,220 --> 01:24:11,960
It shows that Tony Blair and George W.

2941
01:24:11,960 --> 01:24:12,230
Bush,

2942
01:24:12,230 --> 01:24:16,190
we're trying to make plans to go
into Iraq a year before they did,

2943
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:17,870
like they were already like,

2944
01:24:17,871 --> 01:24:18,530
we're going to Iraq.

2945
01:24:18,530 --> 01:24:18,770
Right.

2946
01:24:18,770 --> 01:24:20,240
We're going in like right away.

2947
01:24:20,241 --> 01:24:20,570
They were,

2948
01:24:20,570 --> 01:24:21,590
they were planning on doing that.

2949
01:24:21,591 --> 01:24:21,741
They,

2950
01:24:21,741 --> 01:24:25,970
I think they said from 2002 there was
a emails where they were talking about

2951
01:24:25,971 --> 01:24:28,250
doing it so that before they even
announced that they were doing it,

2952
01:24:28,251 --> 01:24:29,420
they were already trying to figure it out.

2953
01:24:32,450 --> 01:24:36,050
Old people did you God damn old people
should all have to fucking go to war.

2954
01:24:36,200 --> 01:24:37,033
You should have to be,

2955
01:24:37,220 --> 01:24:37,610
it should.

2956
01:24:37,610 --> 01:24:39,620
War should be for people over 50.

2957
01:24:40,310 --> 01:24:41,143
That's it.

2958
01:24:41,300 --> 01:24:42,290
Everybody under 50.

2959
01:24:42,291 --> 01:24:42,670
Look,

2960
01:24:42,670 --> 01:24:42,870
you,

2961
01:24:42,870 --> 01:24:43,701
you lived your life,

2962
01:24:43,701 --> 01:24:44,180
bitch.

2963
01:24:44,180 --> 01:24:45,920
You need to go over there
and start shooting people.

2964
01:24:46,100 --> 01:24:46,700
US,

2965
01:24:46,700 --> 01:24:47,301
we have to,

2966
01:24:47,301 --> 01:24:48,200
I have two more years.

2967
01:24:48,560 --> 01:24:48,771
I,

2968
01:24:48,771 --> 01:24:49,371
we us,

2969
01:24:49,371 --> 01:24:49,970
we have to,

2970
01:24:49,970 --> 01:24:50,540
we have to.

2971
01:24:50,540 --> 01:24:50,961
Yeah.

2972
01:24:50,961 --> 01:24:52,130
We have to figure this world out.

2973
01:24:52,131 --> 01:24:53,450
You've left us with a mess.

2974
01:24:53,870 --> 01:24:55,550
So you guys need to go to war.

2975
01:24:55,700 --> 01:24:57,110
You're the ones who want
to fight all the time.

2976
01:24:57,290 --> 01:24:57,860
Oh yeah.

2977
01:24:57,860 --> 01:24:58,131
Okay.

2978
01:24:58,131 --> 01:24:58,964
Go to war.

2979
01:24:59,570 --> 01:25:00,041
Go over there.

2980
01:25:00,041 --> 01:25:00,710
He fuck.

2981
01:25:00,710 --> 01:25:03,830
See Hillary Clinton with a
machine gun storming the beach.

2982
01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:05,390
You watching any of the debate?

2983
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:10,280
Did you follow that whole Bernie
Sanders Time Warner's CNN thing at all?

2984
01:25:10,430 --> 01:25:12,020
What about the Time Warner's,

2985
01:25:12,120 --> 01:25:12,770
uh,

2986
01:25:12,770 --> 01:25:13,940
so Bernie,

2987
01:25:14,080 --> 01:25:15,650
lot of people think Bernie won like,

2988
01:25:15,651 --> 01:25:18,410
like online online polls to the Twitter.

2989
01:25:18,440 --> 01:25:18,981
Google,

2990
01:25:18,981 --> 01:25:20,690
if you search his name for the most part,

2991
01:25:20,691 --> 01:25:22,610
everyone say Bernie was way ahead of it,

2992
01:25:22,640 --> 01:25:23,750
but not the news,

2993
01:25:23,780 --> 01:25:24,860
but not CNN.

2994
01:25:24,890 --> 01:25:25,711
Even on CNN,

2995
01:25:25,711 --> 01:25:26,870
his own website,

2996
01:25:26,900 --> 01:25:31,900
they had a poll during the debate and
Bernie Sanders was that 75% to Clinton was

2997
01:25:32,571 --> 01:25:34,190
at 18%,

2998
01:25:34,430 --> 01:25:39,430
but they still declared Hillary Clinton
the winner of the debate on CNN.

2999
01:25:39,470 --> 01:25:40,303
Uh,

3000
01:25:40,600 --> 01:25:42,500
that's judging last comic standing.

3001
01:25:43,480 --> 01:25:43,671
You know,

3002
01:25:43,671 --> 01:25:45,800
you can't judge the winner of a debate,

3003
01:25:46,220 --> 01:25:46,551
right?

3004
01:25:46,551 --> 01:25:49,010
It's just always going to
be someone unless they're,

3005
01:25:49,130 --> 01:25:50,000
one of them's like,

3006
01:25:50,360 --> 01:25:50,750
you know,

3007
01:25:50,750 --> 01:25:53,810
Dan Quayle or someone
totally incompetent sh.

3008
01:25:53,870 --> 01:25:55,670
So find out that CNN,

3009
01:25:55,760 --> 01:25:56,120
uh,

3010
01:25:56,120 --> 01:25:57,110
owned by Time Warner,

3011
01:25:57,170 --> 01:26:01,460
Time Warner is the seventh largest
campaign tribute or to Hillary Clinton,

3012
01:26:01,461 --> 01:26:02,271
like over,

3013
01:26:02,271 --> 01:26:05,420
I think it was hundreds and
hundreds of thousands of dollars

3014
01:26:05,420 --> 01:26:08,930
Time Warner as donated
to Hillary course course.

3015
01:26:08,990 --> 01:26:10,190
I'm sure there's an agenda.

3016
01:26:10,460 --> 01:26:11,001
I mean we're,

3017
01:26:11,001 --> 01:26:12,290
we're like laughing.

3018
01:26:12,500 --> 01:26:12,801
You know,

3019
01:26:12,801 --> 01:26:13,634
those thieves,

3020
01:26:13,670 --> 01:26:14,900
they robbed somebody.

3021
01:26:15,050 --> 01:26:16,610
What's hot?

3022
01:26:16,640 --> 01:26:18,020
Did they really rob somebody?

3023
01:26:18,050 --> 01:26:18,890
That's crazy.

3024
01:26:18,950 --> 01:26:23,950
The thieves rob people like were like
surprised that some greasy politician had

3025
01:26:24,461 --> 01:26:27,290
her greasy hands and some
of the greasy company.

3026
01:26:27,440 --> 01:26:27,860
That's true.

3027
01:26:27,860 --> 01:26:28,491
Look what they did.

3028
01:26:28,491 --> 01:26:32,180
The Ron Paul and then when Ron Paul was
doing those debates and smashing people

3029
01:26:32,360 --> 01:26:33,020
and they may,

3030
01:26:33,020 --> 01:26:33,410
they,

3031
01:26:33,410 --> 01:26:38,150
he was ahead of people in the race and
they would look at the people below him

3032
01:26:38,180 --> 01:26:39,290
as qualified,

3033
01:26:39,320 --> 01:26:41,720
sincere candidates and they
would look at Ron Paul.

3034
01:26:41,721 --> 01:26:41,901
Well,

3035
01:26:41,901 --> 01:26:44,990
it's just a matter of time before
Ron Paul's out of the race.

3036
01:26:45,140 --> 01:26:45,591
But you know,

3037
01:26:45,591 --> 01:26:46,550
that's not what he's supposed to do.

3038
01:26:46,551 --> 01:26:47,420
When you're a journalist,

3039
01:26:47,510 --> 01:26:48,470
when you're a journalist,

3040
01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:52,280
you're supposed to look at the actual
event and look at the actual facts of the

3041
01:26:52,281 --> 01:26:54,020
event and then break down.

3042
01:26:54,020 --> 01:26:55,610
What's interesting about the trend,

3043
01:26:56,060 --> 01:26:56,900
but they didn't do that.

3044
01:26:56,901 --> 01:27:00,830
They put a spin on the trend and it's
a spin was clearly that Ron Paul was a

3045
01:27:00,831 --> 01:27:02,570
kook and that this wasn't going to last.

3046
01:27:02,720 --> 01:27:06,320
Even though you've got people wearing Ron
Paul for president shirts and cheering

3047
01:27:06,321 --> 01:27:07,000
and screaming.

3048
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:08,490
W how do your,

3049
01:27:08,590 --> 01:27:12,650
so you are smarter than them to the point
where you're going to dictate how the

3050
01:27:12,651 --> 01:27:13,260
information,

3051
01:27:13,260 --> 01:27:16,910
the news is getting to these people with
a biased spin that makes that guy look

3052
01:27:16,911 --> 01:27:17,744
like a Kook.

3053
01:27:17,790 --> 01:27:19,120
Like that's a Fox News did.

3054
01:27:19,121 --> 01:27:20,240
That's what a lot of people did.

3055
01:27:20,540 --> 01:27:22,070
That's what they're going
to do to Bernie Sanders.

3056
01:27:22,640 --> 01:27:23,720
They're scared of that guy.

3057
01:27:23,990 --> 01:27:24,261
Yeah.

3058
01:27:24,261 --> 01:27:25,760
CNN deleted the pole.

3059
01:27:26,060 --> 01:27:26,391
I mean,

3060
01:27:26,391 --> 01:27:27,224
like

3061
01:27:28,790 --> 01:27:30,160
they deleted the post.

3062
01:27:30,500 --> 01:27:31,420
Find the pole,

3063
01:27:31,421 --> 01:27:32,990
find out to find the email.

3064
01:27:33,050 --> 01:27:33,890
I can find the,

3065
01:27:33,900 --> 01:27:34,733
um,

3066
01:27:35,130 --> 01:27:35,630
the,

3067
01:27:35,630 --> 01:27:36,260
the uh,

3068
01:27:36,260 --> 01:27:37,340
saved image.

3069
01:27:37,400 --> 01:27:38,330
Here it is on the pole.

3070
01:27:38,360 --> 01:27:39,500
I sent it in the email.

3071
01:27:39,530 --> 01:27:41,000
It's a right there.

3072
01:27:42,880 --> 01:27:43,650
Okay.

3073
01:27:43,650 --> 01:27:44,520
When you say right there,

3074
01:27:44,521 --> 01:27:45,810
what am I supposed to see this somewhere.

3075
01:27:48,210 --> 01:27:49,043
Oh,

3076
01:27:49,310 --> 01:27:50,250
well we'll show it to me.

3077
01:27:52,740 --> 01:27:54,180
Oh my God.

3078
01:27:55,710 --> 01:27:57,120
That's hilarious.

3079
01:27:58,400 --> 01:27:59,233
Yeah.

3080
01:27:59,280 --> 01:28:00,480
That's hilarious.

3081
01:28:00,780 --> 01:28:02,160
You silly fucks.

3082
01:28:02,940 --> 01:28:03,810
Good Lord.

3083
01:28:04,410 --> 01:28:05,880
Why did they think they can do that?

3084
01:28:07,080 --> 01:28:08,160
Why would they delete that?

3085
01:28:09,630 --> 01:28:10,840
It's amazing.

3086
01:28:10,890 --> 01:28:11,880
Kind of scary though.

3087
01:28:11,881 --> 01:28:13,830
The Hillary pay 11% yeah.

3088
01:28:15,270 --> 01:28:15,840
Yeah.

3089
01:28:15,840 --> 01:28:16,890
He stumped her.

3090
01:28:18,750 --> 01:28:19,321
God,

3091
01:28:19,321 --> 01:28:22,080
75% well,

3092
01:28:22,081 --> 01:28:22,801
you know what that is?

3093
01:28:22,801 --> 01:28:24,690
That's the online trolls.

3094
01:28:25,080 --> 01:28:28,320
When people don't go
along with your opinion,

3095
01:28:28,350 --> 01:28:29,010
they're trolls.

3096
01:28:29,010 --> 01:28:29,550
O'Malley,

3097
01:28:29,550 --> 01:28:30,060
you're out.

3098
01:28:30,060 --> 01:28:31,200
We can't have red people.

3099
01:28:31,680 --> 01:28:31,951
I mean,

3100
01:28:31,951 --> 01:28:33,300
we can have native Americans,

3101
01:28:33,301 --> 01:28:34,650
but you can't be totally red.

3102
01:28:35,130 --> 01:28:35,911
That's a boozer.

3103
01:28:35,911 --> 01:28:38,940
He's either boozing or he fell asleep
while he's drunk and he got a sunburn.

3104
01:28:39,390 --> 01:28:40,223
Look at that guy.

3105
01:28:40,440 --> 01:28:42,330
He's an Irish guy with a big red face.

3106
01:28:43,260 --> 01:28:44,190
That's ridiculous.

3107
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:45,750
You can't be in there.

3108
01:28:45,750 --> 01:28:46,740
How did he get anything?

3109
01:28:46,770 --> 01:28:47,760
I never heard of that guy.

3110
01:28:49,360 --> 01:28:50,670
If I haven't heard of you by now.

3111
01:28:50,700 --> 01:28:51,533
It's over.

3112
01:28:51,910 --> 01:28:52,743
Yeah,

3113
01:28:52,980 --> 01:28:53,813
throwing the towel.

3114
01:28:54,480 --> 01:28:57,240
This is the black guy who
doesn't believe in evolution.

3115
01:28:57,660 --> 01:29:02,040
There's the Hillary who's got the bad
email account and there's Bernie Sanders

3116
01:29:02,230 --> 01:29:03,450
wants to give away everybody's money.

3117
01:29:04,500 --> 01:29:09,500
But apparently economists looked at
Bernie Sanders plans for reducing deficit

3118
01:29:09,911 --> 01:29:10,651
and like,

3119
01:29:10,651 --> 01:29:13,660
what if this doesn't work like I,

3120
01:29:13,850 --> 01:29:15,360
I don't think anybody
looks at it and goes,

3121
01:29:15,361 --> 01:29:18,360
this is a wonderful idea
that fix our problems.

3122
01:29:18,720 --> 01:29:21,840
He's a serious hardcore
socialist and a lot of ways,

3123
01:29:22,230 --> 01:29:23,190
but I think that's good.

3124
01:29:23,220 --> 01:29:25,320
It's good to have a guy
like that starting it up.

3125
01:29:25,460 --> 01:29:26,700
If that got got into power,

3126
01:29:27,090 --> 01:29:27,923
listen,

3127
01:29:28,110 --> 01:29:30,840
it's fucking better than
having another neo-con.

3128
01:29:31,050 --> 01:29:36,050
It's way better than having another Dick
Cheney behind the fucking puppet stand

3129
01:29:36,390 --> 01:29:39,450
was hand up George Bushes
ass that fucked us.

3130
01:29:39,690 --> 01:29:41,250
Those eight years fucked us.

3131
01:29:41,280 --> 01:29:43,080
They changed the tone of our country.

3132
01:29:43,560 --> 01:29:46,690
They went from a a time
where there was this,

3133
01:29:46,790 --> 01:29:49,680
this feeling of America where
everybody was sympathetic,

3134
01:29:49,800 --> 01:29:52,080
where people were making
new and even Paris,

3135
01:29:52,081 --> 01:29:53,100
they're putting other newspaper.

3136
01:29:53,220 --> 01:29:54,750
We're all Americans today.

3137
01:29:55,220 --> 01:29:55,351
I mean,

3138
01:29:55,351 --> 01:29:55,531
it was,

3139
01:29:55,531 --> 01:30:00,531
it was a amazing time where a horrible
thing happened and the whole world came

3140
01:30:00,721 --> 01:30:05,480
to us and they came to us
and they extended their,

3141
01:30:05,520 --> 01:30:07,800
their love and friendship
and what do we do?

3142
01:30:07,800 --> 01:30:09,360
Which started invading pitches.

3143
01:30:09,390 --> 01:30:11,490
We invaded people that didn't
have anything to do with it.

3144
01:30:11,670 --> 01:30:14,280
We fucked up to the point
where eight years later,

3145
01:30:14,370 --> 01:30:15,600
everybody hated us.

3146
01:30:15,810 --> 01:30:20,130
Everybody went from loving
America to why were you in Iraq?

3147
01:30:20,610 --> 01:30:20,940
Like,

3148
01:30:20,940 --> 01:30:21,541
what do you do?

3149
01:30:21,541 --> 01:30:22,590
There's no weapons there.

3150
01:30:22,591 --> 01:30:24,090
There's nothing that
you guys are assholes.

3151
01:30:24,210 --> 01:30:25,260
What are you doing with all that oil?

3152
01:30:25,290 --> 01:30:26,510
What do you know what?

3153
01:30:26,550 --> 01:30:26,701
Oh,

3154
01:30:26,701 --> 01:30:27,960
you just rebuilding shit.

3155
01:30:27,990 --> 01:30:28,441
What are you doing?

3156
01:30:28,441 --> 01:30:29,610
You just have no wait.

3157
01:30:29,910 --> 01:30:32,400
You have no bid contracts
for billions of dollars.

3158
01:30:32,730 --> 01:30:33,270
What?

3159
01:30:33,270 --> 01:30:33,691
Hold on.

3160
01:30:33,691 --> 01:30:34,080
Hold on.

3161
01:30:34,080 --> 01:30:38,550
You're fucking vice president was the
CEO of the company that gets the no bid

3162
01:30:38,551 --> 01:30:39,151
contracts.

3163
01:30:39,151 --> 01:30:39,631
They are you.

3164
01:30:39,631 --> 01:30:41,580
I said that fucking transparent.

3165
01:30:41,940 --> 01:30:43,200
That it's that transparent.

3166
01:30:43,500 --> 01:30:44,333
That's what happened.

3167
01:30:44,400 --> 01:30:46,200
That those people fucked us.

3168
01:30:46,500 --> 01:30:48,180
If we had Obama in office,

3169
01:30:48,300 --> 01:30:49,800
say what you want about Obama,

3170
01:30:50,130 --> 01:30:52,370
but Obama would've never,

3171
01:30:52,620 --> 01:30:54,660
it w there was no wet unless,

3172
01:30:54,780 --> 01:30:58,740
unless the president has no fucking
say whatsoever on how things go down,

3173
01:30:58,741 --> 01:30:59,820
unless it's that dirty,

3174
01:31:00,810 --> 01:31:03,870
there's no way that guy would
have approached it the same way.

3175
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:07,440
There's no way he would've come up with
some reason why we had to invade Iraq.

3176
01:31:08,070 --> 01:31:08,581
I say that,

3177
01:31:08,581 --> 01:31:11,160
but he did want us to invade
Syria and people were like,

3178
01:31:11,161 --> 01:31:11,994
what?

3179
01:31:12,300 --> 01:31:13,170
I remember that.

3180
01:31:13,950 --> 01:31:14,910
That doesn't come up anymore.

3181
01:31:14,911 --> 01:31:15,744
Does it,

3182
01:31:16,650 --> 01:31:17,520
do you think should end it.

3183
01:31:17,550 --> 01:31:21,990
Do you think news should be put
under stricter guidelines for,

3184
01:31:22,020 --> 01:31:22,740
you know,

3185
01:31:22,740 --> 01:31:23,090
like,

3186
01:31:23,090 --> 01:31:23,551
like that?

3187
01:31:23,551 --> 01:31:24,450
Should it be illegal?

3188
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:24,691
You know,

3189
01:31:24,691 --> 01:31:26,100
CNN picking aside,

3190
01:31:26,160 --> 01:31:30,090
giving money to a president
and then announcing it or
look at the former Fox guy

3191
01:31:30,091 --> 01:31:31,800
that just got arrested for sending,

3192
01:31:31,810 --> 01:31:32,010
you know,

3193
01:31:32,010 --> 01:31:32,843
fabricating a,

3194
01:31:32,910 --> 01:31:36,450
a fake CIA past or Bryan
Adams who you know,

3195
01:31:36,750 --> 01:31:37,300
Brian Williams,

3196
01:31:37,300 --> 01:31:38,133
Brian Williams,

3197
01:31:38,280 --> 01:31:39,113
Bryan Adams.

3198
01:31:42,950 --> 01:31:45,520
He's released a CD that covered
the whole Taylor swift album.

3199
01:31:45,521 --> 01:31:50,270
I highly recommended he re
reimagine Taylor Swiss whole album.

3200
01:31:50,390 --> 01:31:51,223
Oh boy.

3201
01:31:51,440 --> 01:31:53,390
That's been a real dark,

3202
01:31:53,530 --> 01:31:53,940
dark.

3203
01:31:53,940 --> 01:31:54,920
Doesn't sound like Taylor swift.

3204
01:31:55,250 --> 01:31:55,881
Is it like,

3205
01:31:55,881 --> 01:31:56,210
uh,

3206
01:31:56,210 --> 01:31:58,910
like when Garth Brooks had his alter ego,

3207
01:31:59,490 --> 01:32:00,130
it's

3208
01:32:00,130 --> 01:32:04,660
kind of like Willie Nelson
covering a nine inch nails.

3209
01:32:05,140 --> 01:32:05,973
Know,

3210
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:08,500
eat Johnny Cash.

3211
01:32:08,530 --> 01:32:09,281
Not Willie Nelson.

3212
01:32:09,281 --> 01:32:10,030
Yeah.

3213
01:32:10,030 --> 01:32:10,930
Jesus Christ.

3214
01:32:12,730 --> 01:32:17,730
Eddie Murphy told the Bill Cosby joke is
that he got an award for the Mark Twain

3215
01:32:17,770 --> 01:32:20,920
Comedy Award that's going to be on PBS
and he actually did like a whole bit

3216
01:32:21,300 --> 01:32:22,600
cities right in comedy again.

3217
01:32:23,030 --> 01:32:23,360
Yeah.

3218
01:32:23,360 --> 01:32:25,990
TMC had him on yesterday
saying he was gonna he should,

3219
01:32:26,590 --> 01:32:28,360
he should just go full Jim Norton.

3220
01:32:28,570 --> 01:32:28,811
Look,

3221
01:32:28,811 --> 01:32:29,710
I like trainees.

3222
01:32:30,420 --> 01:32:33,010
This is what you should just
do and come back to the fold.

3223
01:32:33,011 --> 01:32:34,180
Just tell us who you are,

3224
01:32:34,210 --> 01:32:34,871
who you got.

3225
01:32:34,871 --> 01:32:35,150
You can't.

3226
01:32:35,150 --> 01:32:36,040
Your Dick sucked by dudes,

3227
01:32:36,041 --> 01:32:37,060
but you're really straight.

3228
01:32:37,300 --> 01:32:38,133
That's okay.

3229
01:32:38,260 --> 01:32:38,921
You're Eddie Murphy,

3230
01:32:38,921 --> 01:32:39,640
man.

3231
01:32:39,640 --> 01:32:41,740
She could come clean but he can't,

3232
01:32:41,741 --> 01:32:42,130
you know,

3233
01:32:42,130 --> 01:32:42,760
it's,

3234
01:32:42,760 --> 01:32:43,780
it's different man.

3235
01:32:43,810 --> 01:32:44,643
It's different.

3236
01:32:45,370 --> 01:32:47,320
Like the black community
has different rules.

3237
01:32:47,830 --> 01:32:48,521
Dev deferrals,

3238
01:32:48,521 --> 01:32:50,920
which you can and can't do and some
things you need to keep under wraps.

3239
01:32:51,370 --> 01:32:55,660
I don't know if he picks
those trans gender prostitutes
up just because he was a

3240
01:32:55,661 --> 01:32:59,080
nice guy and he wants to give him a
ride home or if he really likes them.

3241
01:32:59,830 --> 01:33:04,480
But according to my buddy who was on the
force back then that he's actually been

3242
01:33:04,481 --> 01:33:07,600
there while I went down
there like it wasn't,

3243
01:33:07,601 --> 01:33:08,950
those wasn't just one.

3244
01:33:10,480 --> 01:33:11,200
Wow.

3245
01:33:11,200 --> 01:33:12,033
He likes him,

3246
01:33:12,580 --> 01:33:13,570
which is fine.

3247
01:33:13,630 --> 01:33:16,030
Like Norton talks about it all the time.

3248
01:33:16,031 --> 01:33:19,660
People joke about it all the
time and everybody loves Norton.

3249
01:33:20,200 --> 01:33:21,130
If you don't Love Norton,

3250
01:33:21,131 --> 01:33:22,180
go fuck yourself.

3251
01:33:22,360 --> 01:33:23,193
How about that?

3252
01:33:24,030 --> 01:33:25,990
And I think if Eddie
Murphy just came clean,

3253
01:33:28,100 --> 01:33:32,150
do people turn on though all the people
that voted for proposition eight that

3254
01:33:32,151 --> 01:33:32,441
was when,

3255
01:33:32,441 --> 01:33:34,730
when they found out that Ari
had a great joke about that,

3256
01:33:35,150 --> 01:33:37,220
but black people want to quality.

3257
01:33:37,280 --> 01:33:39,680
Everybody was like talking about a
quality except the gays like Nope,

3258
01:33:39,681 --> 01:33:40,260
not you.

3259
01:33:40,260 --> 01:33:40,940
You can't,

3260
01:33:40,940 --> 01:33:44,180
can't get married like black
people like overwhelmingly voted.

3261
01:33:44,181 --> 01:33:44,800
Again,

3262
01:33:44,800 --> 01:33:49,010
the against or for proposition
eight which repealed gay marriage.

3263
01:33:49,490 --> 01:33:51,260
There's like Mormons.

3264
01:33:51,740 --> 01:33:55,850
Mormons spent a lot of money on it and a
lot of black people voted for religion,

3265
01:33:56,360 --> 01:33:56,760
religion,

3266
01:33:56,760 --> 01:33:57,593
strong and black.

3267
01:33:57,740 --> 01:33:58,101
Yeah,

3268
01:33:58,101 --> 01:33:59,600
but it's also the gay thing.

3269
01:33:59,990 --> 01:34:00,823
It's like a,

3270
01:34:00,830 --> 01:34:04,760
there's a certain amount of homophobia
that's accepted in certain parts of the

3271
01:34:04,761 --> 01:34:06,260
African American community.

3272
01:34:07,610 --> 01:34:12,260
I was a very politically correct way of
saying that black folks don't like gays

3273
01:34:13,520 --> 01:34:15,440
and then it's not even all gays,

3274
01:34:15,441 --> 01:34:15,890
man.

3275
01:34:15,890 --> 01:34:16,310
It's just,

3276
01:34:16,310 --> 01:34:18,110
you can't really talk about it too much.

3277
01:34:18,970 --> 01:34:20,630
But what is the bill Cosby joke he told?

3278
01:34:20,900 --> 01:34:21,081
Oh,

3279
01:34:21,081 --> 01:34:21,914
you mean play it?

3280
01:34:22,430 --> 01:34:23,050
Sure.

3281
01:34:23,050 --> 01:34:23,930
That's all it took a minute.

3282
01:34:23,960 --> 01:34:24,590
Let's do it.

3283
01:34:24,590 --> 01:34:25,130
Play it.

3284
01:34:25,130 --> 01:34:27,080
We're going to get pulled off
youtube while we're on youtube.

3285
01:34:28,040 --> 01:34:29,060
I'll just play the audio.

3286
01:34:29,120 --> 01:34:29,953
Okay.

3287
01:34:32,580 --> 01:34:32,821
Oh,

3288
01:34:32,821 --> 01:34:34,980
and if you are tuning into
this now and you look good,

3289
01:34:34,981 --> 01:34:35,820
too immature Brogan,

3290
01:34:35,821 --> 01:34:38,160
would you post the wrong link on Ustream?

3291
01:34:38,161 --> 01:34:38,940
I made a mistake.

3292
01:34:38,940 --> 01:34:39,750
Sorry.

3293
01:34:39,750 --> 01:34:39,991
Uh,

3294
01:34:39,991 --> 01:34:41,760
I've been doing Ustream for six years.

3295
01:34:41,940 --> 01:34:44,160
But the other thing
about it is that you can,

3296
01:34:44,250 --> 01:34:44,881
on Youtube,

3297
01:34:44,881 --> 01:34:47,440
one of the reasons why we decided to do
it on youtube is you can just rewind it

3298
01:34:47,550 --> 01:34:48,383
to the beginning.

3299
01:34:48,480 --> 01:34:49,590
Even though it's streaming.

3300
01:34:49,650 --> 01:34:50,700
You can go back to the beginning.

3301
01:34:50,730 --> 01:34:51,300
Oh really?

3302
01:34:51,300 --> 01:34:52,110
Yeah.

3303
01:34:52,110 --> 01:34:52,710
It's a,

3304
01:34:52,710 --> 01:34:53,071
it's a,

3305
01:34:53,071 --> 01:34:54,480
it's a superior platform.

3306
01:34:54,510 --> 01:34:55,860
You'll make bill give his event.

3307
01:34:58,460 --> 01:35:00,110
It was a big outcry from people.

3308
01:35:00,111 --> 01:35:02,020
It was trying to get bill
to give his trophies back.

3309
01:35:02,980 --> 01:35:03,510
No,

3310
01:35:03,510 --> 01:35:04,960
you wouldn't want you to
give you the trophies.

3311
01:35:05,230 --> 01:35:10,230
[inaudible] he said do one show.

3312
01:35:15,541 --> 01:35:17,400
We just come out and just talk crazy.

3313
01:35:17,401 --> 01:35:21,180
Now I would like to talk to

3314
01:35:22,870 --> 01:35:25,900
some of the people who

3315
01:35:28,070 --> 01:35:30,760
that I should give back my time.

3316
01:35:32,380 --> 01:35:37,380
[inaudible]

3317
01:35:39,270 --> 01:35:40,103
it.

3318
01:35:40,760 --> 01:35:41,411
They said they go,

3319
01:35:41,411 --> 01:35:42,640
he goes on a little bit longer,

3320
01:35:42,641 --> 01:35:45,760
but this doesn't air on p
until November 23rd on coach.

3321
01:35:45,761 --> 01:35:46,150
So they don't,

3322
01:35:46,150 --> 01:35:48,190
they want you to tune in duty.

3323
01:35:48,280 --> 01:35:49,210
I like his timing.

3324
01:35:50,110 --> 01:35:51,960
He should come back with truing,

3325
01:35:52,990 --> 01:35:53,823
kill it,

3326
01:35:54,460 --> 01:35:55,293
kill it,

3327
01:35:55,840 --> 01:35:58,810
look all that training stuff aside.

3328
01:35:59,350 --> 01:36:00,700
Who cares about that stuff?

3329
01:36:00,880 --> 01:36:02,290
He's one of the all time greats.

3330
01:36:02,830 --> 01:36:05,140
Eddie Murphy when not not um,

3331
01:36:05,180 --> 01:36:06,013
raw.

3332
01:36:06,240 --> 01:36:09,850
I think rob was as good is
delirious but delirious at the time.

3333
01:36:10,120 --> 01:36:10,871
Good Lord.

3334
01:36:10,871 --> 01:36:11,704
That was good.

3335
01:36:12,190 --> 01:36:13,270
He was on fire.

3336
01:36:13,310 --> 01:36:14,530
It was so powerful.

3337
01:36:15,880 --> 01:36:17,260
Imagine him just hanging out at the store.

3338
01:36:17,261 --> 01:36:18,094
Again,

3339
01:36:18,160 --> 01:36:19,330
too many people with swarm him.

3340
01:36:20,110 --> 01:36:20,950
It's hard for us.

3341
01:36:21,810 --> 01:36:22,643
It's hard for you.

3342
01:36:22,840 --> 01:36:23,950
You get swarmed at the store.

3343
01:36:23,951 --> 01:36:27,340
Imagine if you're Eddie Murphy
stores filled with Weirdos.

3344
01:36:27,520 --> 01:36:28,750
It's a magnet for Weirdos.

3345
01:36:28,840 --> 01:36:30,290
It's always been a magnet for Weirdos.

3346
01:36:30,340 --> 01:36:31,030
It's gotten,

3347
01:36:31,030 --> 01:36:31,990
gotten crazy lately,

3348
01:36:32,080 --> 01:36:32,913
too crazy.

3349
01:36:33,220 --> 01:36:35,440
That's why they have the rope off in
the parking lot and to tell people you

3350
01:36:35,441 --> 01:36:37,690
can't go near the cars cause
people are back in their cars out.

3351
01:36:37,840 --> 01:36:40,120
This is a bunch of drunks
wander into the parking lot.

3352
01:36:40,450 --> 01:36:40,751
You know,

3353
01:36:40,751 --> 01:36:41,441
trying to,

3354
01:36:41,441 --> 01:36:41,710
uh,

3355
01:36:41,710 --> 01:36:44,770
take a picture with Steve Run is easy
and they getting run over by cars.

3356
01:36:45,460 --> 01:36:46,293
Um,

3357
01:36:46,510 --> 01:36:46,841
this,

3358
01:36:46,841 --> 01:36:47,650
this thing,

3359
01:36:47,650 --> 01:36:49,230
this article that I want to talk problem,

3360
01:36:49,240 --> 01:36:50,073
we got here,

3361
01:36:50,740 --> 01:36:52,360
a transgender woman.

3362
01:36:53,190 --> 01:36:53,710
Um,

3363
01:36:53,710 --> 01:36:54,521
she was a woman.

3364
01:36:54,521 --> 01:36:56,080
She applied to an all male,

3365
01:36:56,200 --> 01:36:57,490
all female college.

3366
01:36:57,491 --> 01:36:58,930
Well was Wellesley,

3367
01:36:58,960 --> 01:37:00,370
Wellesley college ice.

3368
01:37:00,400 --> 01:37:00,851
Actually,

3369
01:37:00,851 --> 01:37:01,390
uh,

3370
01:37:01,390 --> 01:37:03,550
no girl from Wellesley back in the day,

3371
01:37:04,040 --> 01:37:04,620
um,

3372
01:37:04,620 --> 01:37:06,190
was an all girls' campus.

3373
01:37:06,610 --> 01:37:07,540
And um,

3374
01:37:08,080 --> 01:37:10,030
so she applied for the college.

3375
01:37:10,031 --> 01:37:15,031
She was born a female but then
decided to transition into,

3376
01:37:15,700 --> 01:37:16,450
uh,

3377
01:37:16,450 --> 01:37:18,850
she had a very hilarious,

3378
01:37:18,970 --> 01:37:19,751
this is hilarious.

3379
01:37:19,751 --> 01:37:23,980
Listen to the description of how
she introduces himself herself.

3380
01:37:23,981 --> 01:37:26,770
Whatever masculine of center.

3381
01:37:26,800 --> 01:37:27,940
Gender Queer.

3382
01:37:29,920 --> 01:37:30,880
Exactly.

3383
01:37:31,660 --> 01:37:32,590
Exactly.

3384
01:37:32,640 --> 01:37:32,841
Yeah.

3385
01:37:32,841 --> 01:37:33,520
I,

3386
01:37:33,520 --> 01:37:35,860
I am in love with this story.

3387
01:37:36,240 --> 01:37:38,410
I am in love with these kinds of people.

3388
01:37:38,411 --> 01:37:43,000
I am in love with people that are so
fucking preposterous that they take

3389
01:37:43,001 --> 01:37:45,480
preposterous to an art form and they,

3390
01:37:45,481 --> 01:37:45,850
they,

3391
01:37:45,850 --> 01:37:49,300
they become living parody
whether they like it or not.

3392
01:37:49,390 --> 01:37:51,400
Listen to what the fuck I just said.

3393
01:37:51,550 --> 01:37:53,530
She goes to a college,

3394
01:37:53,531 --> 01:37:55,150
she applies to an all girls college,

3395
01:37:55,170 --> 01:37:55,951
is super liberal,

3396
01:37:55,951 --> 01:37:56,160
all

3397
01:37:56,160 --> 01:37:56,460
gone,

3398
01:37:56,460 --> 01:37:57,360
all girls college.

3399
01:37:57,750 --> 01:38:02,750
She decides that she is transgender
and decides that she wants to,

3400
01:38:02,910 --> 01:38:07,910
she introduces herself as masculine of
center gender queer changes her name to

3401
01:38:08,581 --> 01:38:13,581
Timothy decided that she's Timothy and
asked people to use the male pronoun when

3402
01:38:15,511 --> 01:38:16,470
referring to him.

3403
01:38:16,560 --> 01:38:17,393
Okay,

3404
01:38:17,850 --> 01:38:22,850
so welcome on campus until the day
that she announced he announced,

3405
01:38:23,310 --> 01:38:23,521
okay,

3406
01:38:23,521 --> 01:38:23,661
it's,

3407
01:38:23,661 --> 01:38:24,510
he now whatever,

3408
01:38:24,750 --> 01:38:28,470
that he wanted to run for the school's
Office of multicultural affairs

3409
01:38:28,471 --> 01:38:31,490
coordinator whose job is
to promote a cultural,

3410
01:38:31,620 --> 01:38:36,620
a culture of diversity now who you would
think would need diversity more than

3411
01:38:37,141 --> 01:38:39,450
someone who's a transgender man.

3412
01:38:39,660 --> 01:38:39,931
You know?

3413
01:38:39,931 --> 01:38:40,411
I mean that's,

3414
01:38:40,411 --> 01:38:45,411
that's a very small segment
of the population and they're
often maligned and you

3415
01:38:46,081 --> 01:38:46,650
know,

3416
01:38:46,650 --> 01:38:50,940
this is a socially marginalized group
and it would be nice for an open minded

3417
01:38:50,941 --> 01:38:54,540
liberal college to accept someone like
this and to recognize what a perfect

3418
01:38:54,541 --> 01:38:57,750
person to be a part of our campaign.

3419
01:38:57,870 --> 01:38:59,760
Encouraging people to,

3420
01:38:59,761 --> 01:39:00,150
uh,

3421
01:39:00,150 --> 01:39:00,660
you know,

3422
01:39:00,660 --> 01:39:00,931
to,

3423
01:39:00,931 --> 01:39:03,480
to be more open minded and accept people.

3424
01:39:05,010 --> 01:39:05,340
No,

3425
01:39:05,340 --> 01:39:10,340
they attacked her because now they felt
that she is a white man and they don't

3426
01:39:11,611 --> 01:39:16,380
want a white man in that position because
of a white man is in that position.

3427
01:39:16,500 --> 01:39:18,270
Then they're supporting the patriarchy.

3428
01:39:18,390 --> 01:39:20,370
So there was three other
candidates for the Gig,

3429
01:39:20,400 --> 01:39:21,060
right?

3430
01:39:21,060 --> 01:39:22,770
All women of color.

3431
01:39:23,910 --> 01:39:24,481
Wonderful.

3432
01:39:24,481 --> 01:39:26,040
If one of them win and then you got,

3433
01:39:26,041 --> 01:39:26,311
okay,

3434
01:39:26,311 --> 01:39:27,360
you know what your problem solved.

3435
01:39:27,390 --> 01:39:29,010
You got a woman of color in that position.

3436
01:39:29,160 --> 01:39:30,360
Plenty of diversity there.

3437
01:39:30,390 --> 01:39:30,900
You're good,

3438
01:39:30,900 --> 01:39:31,733
right?

3439
01:39:32,180 --> 01:39:32,550
No,

3440
01:39:32,550 --> 01:39:35,070
they all dropped out
and then they stayed at,

3441
01:39:35,100 --> 01:39:40,100
they started an anonymous Facebook
campaign encouraging people not to vote at

3442
01:39:40,381 --> 01:39:41,160
all,

3443
01:39:41,160 --> 01:39:44,190
to keep a white man from
winning the position.

3444
01:39:44,460 --> 01:39:45,680
Ah,

3445
01:39:46,140 --> 01:39:47,790
this is amazing.

3446
01:39:47,940 --> 01:39:50,190
This is the left eating itself.

3447
01:39:50,220 --> 01:39:51,090
That's what's happening.

3448
01:39:51,091 --> 01:39:52,350
They're eating themselves.

3449
01:39:52,500 --> 01:39:54,210
It is a feeding frenzy.

3450
01:39:54,420 --> 01:39:55,740
I used to have Paranas.

3451
01:39:55,800 --> 01:39:56,633
Okay,

3452
01:39:56,970 --> 01:39:58,280
and one of the things
about [inaudible] is,

3453
01:39:58,290 --> 01:39:58,501
well,

3454
01:39:58,501 --> 01:40:00,000
one gets a limp.

3455
01:40:00,240 --> 01:40:01,860
They just jacked that motherfucker.

3456
01:40:01,861 --> 01:40:03,480
They are the most ruthless cunts.

3457
01:40:03,750 --> 01:40:05,310
When one Parana would just be,

3458
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:06,031
you know,

3459
01:40:06,031 --> 01:40:07,410
sometimes you have a fish tank,

3460
01:40:07,650 --> 01:40:08,061
one fish,

3461
01:40:08,061 --> 01:40:09,270
we'll just start swimming weird.

3462
01:40:09,510 --> 01:40:11,940
They start swimming kind of
half sideways for some reason.

3463
01:40:11,941 --> 01:40:12,151
You're like,

3464
01:40:12,151 --> 01:40:13,140
is that fish okay?

3465
01:40:13,290 --> 01:40:14,280
And you have to look at him like,

3466
01:40:14,281 --> 01:40:15,300
what's going on with that fish?

3467
01:40:15,660 --> 01:40:17,670
That shit didn't last in that tank baby.

3468
01:40:17,920 --> 01:40:19,140
All those motherfuckers are just,

3469
01:40:21,390 --> 01:40:22,920
they just started taking
chunks out of them.

3470
01:40:23,130 --> 01:40:24,420
That's what's happening here.

3471
01:40:24,510 --> 01:40:27,330
The left is they're turning on themselves.

3472
01:40:27,510 --> 01:40:29,070
They've run out of outrage.

3473
01:40:29,190 --> 01:40:31,050
They've made so many safe places.

3474
01:40:31,051 --> 01:40:33,570
They don't want anything to be safe
anymore and they want to be able to go to

3475
01:40:33,571 --> 01:40:34,680
war over everything.

3476
01:40:35,040 --> 01:40:36,720
They're ferocious there.

3477
01:40:36,721 --> 01:40:41,721
Paranas their social idea Paranas
and they're attacking a gender.

3478
01:40:42,241 --> 01:40:43,074
Quill,

3479
01:40:43,110 --> 01:40:44,160
Gender Queer,

3480
01:40:44,310 --> 01:40:49,310
masculine of center man for not being
diverse enough for being a part of the

3481
01:40:50,641 --> 01:40:51,570
patriarchy,

3482
01:40:51,810 --> 01:40:53,460
Bardo woman board.

3483
01:40:53,540 --> 01:40:55,300
A woman lived as a woman.

3484
01:40:55,450 --> 01:40:55,810
Nope,

3485
01:40:55,810 --> 01:40:56,860
you're a white man now.

3486
01:40:56,861 --> 01:40:58,030
You fucking piece of shit.

3487
01:40:58,090 --> 01:40:59,320
You're a part of the problem.

3488
01:41:01,250 --> 01:41:02,120
Makes no sense.

3489
01:41:04,300 --> 01:41:05,830
It does make sense though.

3490
01:41:06,040 --> 01:41:08,950
It makes sense because it highlights
what this movement is all about.

3491
01:41:08,951 --> 01:41:10,180
It's socially retarded.

3492
01:41:10,181 --> 01:41:14,410
People that are left alone to their own
devices and they're just devouring each

3493
01:41:14,411 --> 01:41:15,490
other like zombies.

3494
01:41:15,640 --> 01:41:17,140
They just tearing into each other like,

3495
01:41:17,190 --> 01:41:19,480
like zombies at a trapped
into a fucking room.

3496
01:41:19,481 --> 01:41:20,380
It doesn't raw.

3497
01:41:20,530 --> 01:41:22,000
They just ripping each other apart.

3498
01:41:22,270 --> 01:41:23,650
You're not diverse enough.

3499
01:41:24,100 --> 01:41:25,300
You're not progressive enough.

3500
01:41:25,301 --> 01:41:25,961
Fuck you.

3501
01:41:25,961 --> 01:41:26,651
You're such a pig.

3502
01:41:26,651 --> 01:41:27,484
I'm triggered.

3503
01:41:27,520 --> 01:41:29,380
They just trigger each
other left and right.

3504
01:41:32,950 --> 01:41:33,431
This is,

3505
01:41:33,431 --> 01:41:33,610
uh,

3506
01:41:33,610 --> 01:41:35,200
this is an onion article.

3507
01:41:35,470 --> 01:41:37,630
This is a fucking onion
article and it's not,

3508
01:41:37,750 --> 01:41:39,250
this is the national review.

3509
01:41:39,400 --> 01:41:44,400
This is a goddamn onion article and
it's not transgender woman can't be

3510
01:41:44,801 --> 01:41:47,860
diversity officer because
she's a white man now.

3511
01:41:51,440 --> 01:41:51,720
Yeah.

3512
01:41:51,720 --> 01:41:55,020
Mixed 0 million cents makes
all the sense in the world.

3513
01:41:55,230 --> 01:41:56,460
It's not a fake article.

3514
01:41:56,461 --> 01:41:59,130
I mean that seems like a
hundred percent perfect.

3515
01:41:59,160 --> 01:41:59,993
It's perfect.

3516
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:00,900
It's amazing.

3517
01:42:01,110 --> 01:42:02,010
It's beautiful.

3518
01:42:02,160 --> 01:42:05,610
It's a rose is a rose
in a bad neighborhood.

3519
01:42:05,611 --> 01:42:08,460
It pops out of the concrete
and it comes out perfect.

3520
01:42:08,850 --> 01:42:09,683
It's amazing.

3521
01:42:09,930 --> 01:42:10,763
This is art.

3522
01:42:10,980 --> 01:42:11,381
It's,

3523
01:42:11,381 --> 01:42:14,010
it's the universe creating
art with our own folly.

3524
01:42:14,220 --> 01:42:15,053
That's what it is.

3525
01:42:15,270 --> 01:42:16,200
It's culture.

3526
01:42:16,380 --> 01:42:17,350
It's called [inaudible].

3527
01:42:17,390 --> 01:42:18,300
It's people,

3528
01:42:18,770 --> 01:42:19,110
you know.

3529
01:42:19,110 --> 01:42:21,990
There's something that happens to people
when you deny reality when you don't

3530
01:42:21,991 --> 01:42:24,030
look at things objectively like there's,

3531
01:42:24,060 --> 01:42:27,390
there's I think like
priest at molests kids,

3532
01:42:27,570 --> 01:42:27,841
right?

3533
01:42:27,841 --> 01:42:30,030
Some of that has to be from suppression.

3534
01:42:30,180 --> 01:42:32,580
Some of it has to be probably
they were abused themselves.

3535
01:42:32,790 --> 01:42:33,720
There's probably all sorts of,

3536
01:42:33,721 --> 01:42:38,400
but some of that perversion has
got to come from suppression.

3537
01:42:38,610 --> 01:42:41,670
It's like the Catholic school
girl thing that everybody knows.

3538
01:42:41,820 --> 01:42:42,091
You know,

3539
01:42:42,091 --> 01:42:43,080
when I was in high school,

3540
01:42:43,081 --> 01:42:46,200
there was no scientists in
my fucking ninth grade class,

3541
01:42:46,380 --> 01:42:50,400
but we all knew the girls went to Catholic
schools were hose and why are they

3542
01:42:50,401 --> 01:42:51,750
hose the hose?

3543
01:42:51,751 --> 01:42:53,610
Because everybody tells
them they can't be a Ho.

3544
01:42:53,730 --> 01:42:55,440
Everybody's talking to
them constantly about,

3545
01:42:55,590 --> 01:42:57,510
you are going to go to hell,

3546
01:42:57,600 --> 01:42:59,490
do not touch a man's genitals,

3547
01:42:59,700 --> 01:43:00,630
don't you do anything.

3548
01:43:00,750 --> 01:43:02,130
Those costs were freaks.

3549
01:43:02,131 --> 01:43:04,830
They were the biggest
freaks and we all knew it.

3550
01:43:05,010 --> 01:43:05,341
It was.

3551
01:43:05,341 --> 01:43:05,730
It was.

3552
01:43:05,730 --> 01:43:06,870
There was no books on it.

3553
01:43:07,140 --> 01:43:09,630
There was no youtube
videos that we could watch,

3554
01:43:09,720 --> 01:43:10,800
but we fucking knew it.

3555
01:43:10,801 --> 01:43:11,310
Man.

3556
01:43:11,310 --> 01:43:16,310
We all knew it and I think it's a
suppression issue and this is suppressing

3557
01:43:16,710 --> 01:43:18,120
individual identity.

3558
01:43:18,121 --> 01:43:19,800
This is suppressing free speech.

3559
01:43:20,010 --> 01:43:21,600
This is suppressing objectivity.

3560
01:43:21,720 --> 01:43:25,620
You're not allowed to have
unique or intertwined thoughts.

3561
01:43:25,770 --> 01:43:28,740
You're not allowed to share opinions
with the left and with the right.

3562
01:43:28,830 --> 01:43:29,820
You're not allowed to.

3563
01:43:29,940 --> 01:43:30,601
You have to have,

3564
01:43:30,601 --> 01:43:32,730
and you're constantly worried
about being called out.

3565
01:43:32,940 --> 01:43:37,410
You're constantly worried about being
outed and doxed and called out and shamed.

3566
01:43:37,560 --> 01:43:41,640
Everyone's shaming people and attacking
people and it's this fucking feeding

3567
01:43:41,641 --> 01:43:42,474
frenzy.

3568
01:43:43,920 --> 01:43:44,753
I love it.

3569
01:43:44,830 --> 01:43:45,900
I'm happy.

3570
01:43:46,050 --> 01:43:48,000
I'm so happy when I
read a story like this.

3571
01:43:48,180 --> 01:43:51,830
I would encourage this woman to
fight to the death her position.

3572
01:43:51,860 --> 01:43:52,520
Oh man,

3573
01:43:52,520 --> 01:43:53,353
she's a man now.

3574
01:43:53,420 --> 01:43:55,340
Fight to the death for that position.

3575
01:43:56,090 --> 01:43:56,923
I mean literally,

3576
01:43:56,930 --> 01:44:01,310
I want you to show up for school in a
fucking an armor with a sword and let them

3577
01:44:01,311 --> 01:44:02,420
know that you are,

3578
01:44:02,421 --> 01:44:06,520
you are here because you are a warrior
for diversity and you're going to get,

3579
01:44:06,760 --> 01:44:08,750
you're going to take this to the very end,

3580
01:44:08,900 --> 01:44:10,370
to the very end of time.

3581
01:44:11,410 --> 01:44:12,080
Oh,

3582
01:44:12,080 --> 01:44:12,913
it's amazing.

3583
01:44:14,300 --> 01:44:15,500
This is an amazing story.

3584
01:44:16,730 --> 01:44:20,660
It's like one of the greatest stories
the universe has ever told cause it's,

3585
01:44:20,661 --> 01:44:21,490
it's just,

3586
01:44:21,490 --> 01:44:21,811
and it,

3587
01:44:21,811 --> 01:44:24,530
it highlights that story that we
were just talking about where the,

3588
01:44:24,531 --> 01:44:25,364
um,

3589
01:44:25,400 --> 01:44:26,600
the thing that was up on the,

3590
01:44:26,601 --> 01:44:26,751
uh,

3591
01:44:26,751 --> 01:44:28,130
the thing earlier with the,

3592
01:44:28,131 --> 01:44:28,341
the,

3593
01:44:28,341 --> 01:44:30,140
the United States is like a powder keg.

3594
01:44:30,660 --> 01:44:32,330
This is like what we're talking about,

3595
01:44:32,331 --> 01:44:36,500
like entitled ridiculous people
that they don't live in reality.

3596
01:44:36,530 --> 01:44:36,691
You're,

3597
01:44:36,691 --> 01:44:36,971
you're,

3598
01:44:36,971 --> 01:44:37,460
you're not,

3599
01:44:37,460 --> 01:44:37,821
and you're,

3600
01:44:37,821 --> 01:44:39,410
you're concentrating on nonsense.

3601
01:44:39,650 --> 01:44:42,950
But why they concentrating on nonsense
because they don't have to worry about

3602
01:44:42,951 --> 01:44:43,820
feeding themselves.

3603
01:44:44,030 --> 01:44:45,410
They don't have to worry about shelter.

3604
01:44:45,560 --> 01:44:50,150
They don't have to worry about being in
Ohio having no fucking power for a week

3605
01:44:50,540 --> 01:44:52,190
and everybody has to stay alive.

3606
01:44:52,550 --> 01:44:53,690
You can't get to work.

3607
01:44:53,720 --> 01:44:56,390
Everybody's like walking back
and forth to each other's house,

3608
01:44:56,391 --> 01:45:01,310
Sharon food and going out and getting
firewood together and dragging it back at

3609
01:45:01,311 --> 01:45:02,510
some little kids wagon.

3610
01:45:02,720 --> 01:45:04,430
That's what people do
when they want to survive.

3611
01:45:05,030 --> 01:45:05,430
When,

3612
01:45:05,430 --> 01:45:06,650
when you want to survive,

3613
01:45:06,890 --> 01:45:10,010
you come up with ways that
you could all work together.

3614
01:45:10,220 --> 01:45:11,840
When it's too easy to survive,

3615
01:45:11,990 --> 01:45:15,530
you start attacking people for nonsense
and that's what the fuck is going on

3616
01:45:15,531 --> 01:45:15,890
here.

3617
01:45:15,890 --> 01:45:17,810
You got to campaign to keep,

3618
01:45:18,160 --> 01:45:19,580
we're going to make sure that a white man,

3619
01:45:19,581 --> 01:45:20,390
it's not going to win this.

3620
01:45:20,390 --> 01:45:22,100
Like as if she's really a white man.

3621
01:45:22,500 --> 01:45:27,500
Why are we pretending that's a man
left of Queer Gender Queer masculine of

3622
01:45:28,551 --> 01:45:28,881
center.

3623
01:45:28,881 --> 01:45:30,290
Shut the fuck up.

3624
01:45:30,530 --> 01:45:31,460
You're a girl,

3625
01:45:31,760 --> 01:45:33,110
you're a girl or a guy,

3626
01:45:33,111 --> 01:45:34,040
whatever you are.

3627
01:45:34,070 --> 01:45:37,850
Who cares what the fuck it was
probably way more to this story.

3628
01:45:37,851 --> 01:45:39,370
She's just a big bitch and I like,

3629
01:45:39,740 --> 01:45:40,640
she's just kind of got,

3630
01:45:40,710 --> 01:45:43,340
we just eating too much pussy on campus.

3631
01:45:43,341 --> 01:45:44,120
They're all mad.

3632
01:45:44,120 --> 01:45:44,310
Yeah,

3633
01:45:44,310 --> 01:45:45,680
so it's just too good at it.

3634
01:45:45,710 --> 01:45:46,670
She's too good at it.

3635
01:45:47,390 --> 01:45:48,380
But she's gender queer,

3636
01:45:48,381 --> 01:45:49,730
so that means I don't
think he'd do anything.

3637
01:45:50,690 --> 01:45:51,740
I don't know what that means.

3638
01:45:52,220 --> 01:45:53,450
I don't even think they
know what it means.

3639
01:45:53,600 --> 01:45:53,951
But you know what?

3640
01:45:53,951 --> 01:45:55,640
You've heard of pansexual.

3641
01:45:56,540 --> 01:45:57,740
There was a woman who was like,

3642
01:45:57,800 --> 01:45:59,060
she was making history.

3643
01:45:59,090 --> 01:46:00,140
This is hilarious.

3644
01:46:00,290 --> 01:46:01,730
This is a hilarious story.

3645
01:46:01,910 --> 01:46:04,460
She's making history because
she was the first Gen.

3646
01:46:04,490 --> 01:46:08,270
Oh she was the first pan
sexual person to take office

3647
01:46:10,200 --> 01:46:10,850
pants.

3648
01:46:10,850 --> 01:46:12,740
What the fuck are you talking about?

3649
01:46:13,070 --> 01:46:14,960
What does that mean to me?

3650
01:46:14,961 --> 01:46:18,050
And she doesn't sexually identify.

3651
01:46:18,200 --> 01:46:22,970
She's not particularly sexually attracted
to either race or either gender.

3652
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:24,410
It's either one or both.

3653
01:46:25,250 --> 01:46:26,830
Miley Cyrus pansexual,

3654
01:46:27,020 --> 01:46:27,853
of course she is.

3655
01:46:28,250 --> 01:46:29,330
That's called being a freak.

3656
01:46:30,650 --> 01:46:31,670
Pansexual.

3657
01:46:31,700 --> 01:46:32,960
What exactly does that mean?

3658
01:46:33,170 --> 01:46:37,220
But go find the politician
first politician as pansexual.

3659
01:46:37,790 --> 01:46:39,050
It's just so stupid.

3660
01:46:39,170 --> 01:46:40,670
Pen Sexual politician.

3661
01:46:40,850 --> 01:46:42,470
Since like a new word for bisexual,

3662
01:46:42,650 --> 01:46:43,940
it's not even bisexual.

3663
01:46:43,941 --> 01:46:48,240
It's cause like they have to be
special and that it has to be met.

3664
01:46:48,280 --> 01:46:53,280
Mary Texas state representative
identifies as pansexual in new interview.

3665
01:46:53,730 --> 01:46:54,360
First of all,

3666
01:46:54,360 --> 01:46:55,193
good for her.

3667
01:46:55,410 --> 01:46:56,221
Eat that pussy.

3668
01:46:56,221 --> 01:46:57,120
Suck that Dick.

3669
01:46:57,300 --> 01:46:58,051
Have a party.

3670
01:46:58,051 --> 01:46:58,620
Honey,

3671
01:46:58,620 --> 01:46:59,453
I'm not hating.

3672
01:47:01,260 --> 01:47:01,981
Do whatever you want,

3673
01:47:01,981 --> 01:47:04,350
but do we really have to
make it new name for it?

3674
01:47:04,410 --> 01:47:05,610
Fucking Christ.

3675
01:47:06,470 --> 01:47:07,020
I and I,

3676
01:47:07,020 --> 01:47:07,270
I,

3677
01:47:07,270 --> 01:47:10,740
I posted something about this awhile
back on Twitter and there was people that

3678
01:47:10,741 --> 01:47:12,330
were defending the term pansexual.

3679
01:47:12,331 --> 01:47:12,750
I'm like,

3680
01:47:12,750 --> 01:47:14,160
fuck you.

3681
01:47:14,400 --> 01:47:16,470
Fuck you for trying to muddy up the war.

3682
01:47:16,530 --> 01:47:18,600
Fuck you for having this on your mind.

3683
01:47:18,900 --> 01:47:20,010
Unless you're mocking it.

3684
01:47:20,160 --> 01:47:22,140
Fuck you for taking this seriously.

3685
01:47:22,620 --> 01:47:24,390
Fuck you for this being an actual thing.

3686
01:47:24,391 --> 01:47:25,860
When you want to debate it,

3687
01:47:26,130 --> 01:47:27,540
how bad is your job?

3688
01:47:27,570 --> 01:47:30,240
How bored are you at work that you're
sitting in front of your Twitter account

3689
01:47:30,241 --> 01:47:33,120
defending pansexuality you stop.

3690
01:47:34,200 --> 01:47:34,850
You stop.

3691
01:47:34,850 --> 01:47:35,760
I'm saying she could do it.

3692
01:47:35,820 --> 01:47:36,511
I have no problem with,

3693
01:47:36,511 --> 01:47:36,960
you know,

3694
01:47:36,960 --> 01:47:37,740
don't get me wrong,

3695
01:47:37,740 --> 01:47:39,300
but you fucking stop.

3696
01:47:39,301 --> 01:47:40,590
If you think you're going to defend that,

3697
01:47:40,680 --> 01:47:41,311
fuck you.

3698
01:47:41,311 --> 01:47:43,020
You need to go cut snow cuts.

3699
01:47:43,020 --> 01:47:43,860
No need to go.

3700
01:47:43,870 --> 01:47:48,870
Countries need to go cut trees and shovel
snow over Jamie's parents house in the

3701
01:47:49,560 --> 01:47:51,150
middle of the winter when the
fucking power's off for a month.

3702
01:47:52,050 --> 01:47:52,980
That's what you need to do.

3703
01:47:53,280 --> 01:47:54,900
You need to dig Brian red bands.

3704
01:47:54,901 --> 01:47:56,340
Mom out of the fucking woods.

3705
01:47:56,670 --> 01:47:57,720
Dig Out of the woods.

3706
01:47:57,780 --> 01:48:00,180
It's a mile dirt road
back to that lady's house.

3707
01:48:00,450 --> 01:48:01,500
Get get going.

3708
01:48:01,501 --> 01:48:02,340
Fuck face.

3709
01:48:02,490 --> 01:48:03,001
That's like,

3710
01:48:03,001 --> 01:48:03,421
what does that,

3711
01:48:03,421 --> 01:48:04,620
how many thousand feet is a mile?

3712
01:48:05,520 --> 01:48:06,353
5,000.

3713
01:48:06,780 --> 01:48:08,880
5,000 plus feet of snow shoveling.

3714
01:48:08,881 --> 01:48:10,590
You fuck how much for the driveway?

3715
01:48:11,780 --> 01:48:13,730
Do you remember that you've ever,

3716
01:48:13,740 --> 01:48:16,800
that when you're a kid you'd
go to a lady's house and uh,

3717
01:48:17,400 --> 01:48:17,761
ma'am,

3718
01:48:17,761 --> 01:48:17,961
we're,

3719
01:48:17,961 --> 01:48:18,810
we're shoveling stone.

3720
01:48:18,811 --> 01:48:18,931
Well,

3721
01:48:18,931 --> 01:48:20,070
how much for the driveway?

3722
01:48:20,100 --> 01:48:20,360
Like,

3723
01:48:20,360 --> 01:48:20,550
oh,

3724
01:48:20,550 --> 01:48:21,720
we're going to need 20 for this one.

3725
01:48:21,721 --> 01:48:22,830
That's too much.

3726
01:48:22,950 --> 01:48:24,180
That's too much.

3727
01:48:24,300 --> 01:48:25,290
It's a long driveway,

3728
01:48:25,291 --> 01:48:25,461
man.

3729
01:48:25,461 --> 01:48:26,760
It was going to take us a couple hours.

3730
01:48:26,970 --> 01:48:27,340
Oh,

3731
01:48:27,340 --> 01:48:28,590
that's just too much.

3732
01:48:29,160 --> 01:48:30,360
They would get mad at you.

3733
01:48:30,360 --> 01:48:33,840
Not Miss those days are
having to mow people's lawns.

3734
01:48:33,841 --> 01:48:35,150
She just take her to not miss it.

3735
01:48:35,670 --> 01:48:36,790
Miss Mowing.

3736
01:48:36,810 --> 01:48:38,100
I hated mowing lawns.

3737
01:48:38,370 --> 01:48:40,710
I was watching Anthony
Bourdain show last night.

3738
01:48:41,370 --> 01:48:44,040
He did a special on a San
Francisco is pretty bad ass.

3739
01:48:44,370 --> 01:48:45,203
But um,

3740
01:48:45,230 --> 01:48:47,550
then I watched one that I had on the DVR.

3741
01:48:47,580 --> 01:48:48,361
I was doing some work,

3742
01:48:48,361 --> 01:48:48,840
so I was like,

3743
01:48:48,840 --> 01:48:52,160
just kind of like half watching it while
I was working on the laptop and uh,

3744
01:48:52,200 --> 01:48:55,590
he had one from Montreal in the
middle of the winter and you're like,

3745
01:48:55,650 --> 01:48:56,580
oh Jesus,

3746
01:48:56,581 --> 01:48:57,600
I forgot.

3747
01:48:58,020 --> 01:48:59,400
I forgot what that was like.

3748
01:48:59,490 --> 01:49:00,323
Oof.

3749
01:49:00,870 --> 01:49:01,650
Oof.

3750
01:49:01,650 --> 01:49:03,360
They're just all bundled up outside.

3751
01:49:03,361 --> 01:49:05,250
Everyone's face is beat red.

3752
01:49:05,400 --> 01:49:10,380
Every breath that comes out of your mouth
is frozen because that place is wet.

3753
01:49:10,830 --> 01:49:12,120
That's a wet cold too.

3754
01:49:12,150 --> 01:49:17,150
That's a by the ocean cold zero degrees
by the ocean is a mother fucker.

3755
01:49:17,880 --> 01:49:18,713
Dude,

3756
01:49:19,050 --> 01:49:20,820
that's not like the cryotherapy tank.

3757
01:49:23,100 --> 01:49:25,260
I got some new videos
that you have to watch.

3758
01:49:25,270 --> 01:49:27,810
Sometimes it's a semi a dude's Dick.

3759
01:49:27,870 --> 01:49:30,570
The other day that dude
dancing and pulls his dick out.

3760
01:49:31,840 --> 01:49:34,110
Will you let you send them to me so much

3761
01:49:35,640 --> 01:49:38,520
that I accuse you of sending me
a guy's Dick and you're like,

3762
01:49:38,550 --> 01:49:40,320
why didn't eh,

3763
01:49:40,350 --> 01:49:40,501
well,

3764
01:49:40,501 --> 01:49:43,650
it sometimes people will send me shit
and I immediately just send it to whoever

3765
01:49:43,740 --> 01:49:45,800
is these.

3766
01:49:45,840 --> 01:49:47,920
These guys made this a

3767
01:49:47,980 --> 01:49:51,670
prank video and what they did is they
took a taser and they put it in the seat

3768
01:49:51,730 --> 01:49:54,880
of a bicycle and attached it
to a cell phone so he can,

3769
01:49:54,910 --> 01:49:56,290
you can call it and make,

3770
01:49:56,410 --> 01:49:57,520
activate the Taser.

3771
01:49:57,820 --> 01:49:58,391
Then they took,

3772
01:49:58,391 --> 01:50:01,090
went to Compton and just
like put their bike down,

3773
01:50:01,091 --> 01:50:01,421
you know,

3774
01:50:01,421 --> 01:50:03,550
and waited until somebody
stole their bike.

3775
01:50:03,880 --> 01:50:05,320
And so then you see people like writing,

3776
01:50:05,440 --> 01:50:09,100
like taking off and then they like
called the cell phone and it uh,

3777
01:50:09,580 --> 01:50:10,540
shocks their balls.

3778
01:50:10,541 --> 01:50:11,860
You know why they're sitting on the bike?

3779
01:50:13,270 --> 01:50:15,190
So they just fall off the bike.

3780
01:50:16,210 --> 01:50:18,510
That's like an advanced version of that.

3781
01:50:18,511 --> 01:50:20,280
A Bait car show?

3782
01:50:20,310 --> 01:50:21,143
Yes.

3783
01:50:21,300 --> 01:50:21,860
Yeah.

3784
01:50:21,860 --> 01:50:22,410
Yeah.

3785
01:50:22,410 --> 01:50:22,990
And then they have it,

3786
01:50:22,990 --> 01:50:23,350
there

3787
01:50:23,350 --> 01:50:26,080
is this other guy that
just attached a rope to it,

3788
01:50:26,081 --> 01:50:27,730
like a secret little like rope to it.

3789
01:50:27,731 --> 01:50:31,780
So people like grabbed the bike and take
off down this hill and then when the

3790
01:50:31,870 --> 01:50:35,960
rope catches up it just throws the bike
back and they just rack their balls.

3791
01:50:36,010 --> 01:50:36,620
Like,

3792
01:50:36,620 --> 01:50:37,310
God,

3793
01:50:37,310 --> 01:50:39,520
all these people are just
breaking balls and like,

3794
01:50:39,640 --> 01:50:40,071
but they,

3795
01:50:40,071 --> 01:50:40,661
they would feet.

3796
01:50:40,661 --> 01:50:41,500
So who cares?

3797
01:50:41,501 --> 01:50:42,320
You know

3798
01:50:42,320 --> 01:50:43,141
it's a loophole,

3799
01:50:43,141 --> 01:50:43,974
right?

3800
01:50:44,550 --> 01:50:46,840
You could get really fucked up doing that.

3801
01:50:46,841 --> 01:50:48,060
Like it hurt bad.

3802
01:50:48,160 --> 01:50:48,610
Yeah,

3803
01:50:48,610 --> 01:50:49,630
but they're stealing.

3804
01:50:49,631 --> 01:50:50,680
So who gives a fuck?

3805
01:50:50,681 --> 01:50:55,060
I know I'm addicted to these new things
like these bait card things and bait

3806
01:50:55,061 --> 01:50:55,361
bikes.

3807
01:50:55,361 --> 01:50:56,194
So

3808
01:50:56,340 --> 01:50:58,270
main Edwards has a hilarious bit.

3809
01:50:58,710 --> 01:51:01,050
Ian Has a hilarious bit
on that bait car show.

3810
01:51:01,110 --> 01:51:01,500
Oh yeah.

3811
01:51:01,500 --> 01:51:01,651
Oh,

3812
01:51:01,651 --> 01:51:02,520
it's so funny.

3813
01:51:02,910 --> 01:51:03,631
In San Diego,

3814
01:51:03,631 --> 01:51:03,870
right?

3815
01:51:03,870 --> 01:51:04,290
Yeah.

3816
01:51:04,290 --> 01:51:06,810
He worked with Ian San Diego Friday night.

3817
01:51:06,840 --> 01:51:07,351
Fuck.

3818
01:51:07,351 --> 01:51:08,190
He's funny man.

3819
01:51:08,610 --> 01:51:10,110
He's such a good dude too.

3820
01:51:10,140 --> 01:51:13,140
He's one of those guys and he's
been writing for shows forever,

3821
01:51:13,380 --> 01:51:16,740
so he hasn't been like touring
a lot and doing the road a lot.

3822
01:51:17,010 --> 01:51:17,400
But,

3823
01:51:17,400 --> 01:51:20,610
but he's also been doing
comedy for like 25 years.

3824
01:51:20,820 --> 01:51:22,470
He's one of the best guys in the world.

3825
01:51:22,500 --> 01:51:23,310
He really is.

3826
01:51:23,310 --> 01:51:23,850
He's like,

3827
01:51:23,850 --> 01:51:27,090
if there's one guy that people
just don't know about that I go,

3828
01:51:27,091 --> 01:51:27,811
God damn.

3829
01:51:27,811 --> 01:51:29,250
People should know about Ian Edwards.

3830
01:51:29,380 --> 01:51:31,140
Like people are knowing
about Thompson grow now.

3831
01:51:31,290 --> 01:51:31,441
I mean,

3832
01:51:31,441 --> 01:51:33,150
he's doing his second Netflix special.

3833
01:51:33,180 --> 01:51:34,013
Just did it.

3834
01:51:34,140 --> 01:51:34,471
You know,

3835
01:51:34,471 --> 01:51:35,850
everything's going great for him.

3836
01:51:35,910 --> 01:51:36,130
You know,

3837
01:51:36,130 --> 01:51:36,660
Rei,

3838
01:51:36,660 --> 01:51:38,730
obviously everything's
going great for our Dunkin.

3839
01:51:38,731 --> 01:51:40,350
If he just would put out some content.

3840
01:51:40,650 --> 01:51:42,000
Like doc is brilliant.

3841
01:51:42,210 --> 01:51:43,500
His comedy is amazing,

3842
01:51:43,530 --> 01:51:44,370
he's excellent.

3843
01:51:44,520 --> 01:51:45,840
He just doesn't put anything out.

3844
01:51:46,320 --> 01:51:47,091
He doesn't do,

3845
01:51:47,091 --> 01:51:49,490
he doesn't do any fucking specials.

3846
01:51:49,491 --> 01:51:54,491
He's actually really heard anything from
Dunkin in a while like online or it's

3847
01:51:55,141 --> 01:51:56,250
hard to find a stand up.

3848
01:51:56,460 --> 01:51:56,941
You know what I mean?

3849
01:51:56,941 --> 01:51:59,520
He works all the time and he was at
the store the other night killing it.

3850
01:51:59,521 --> 01:52:00,630
It's still hilarious.

3851
01:52:01,170 --> 01:52:02,610
He just doesn't put anything out.

3852
01:52:02,880 --> 01:52:03,241
He,

3853
01:52:03,241 --> 01:52:05,430
he's constantly working on his podcast.

3854
01:52:05,431 --> 01:52:08,670
I think Dunkin likes doing
podcasts more than anything,

3855
01:52:09,060 --> 01:52:10,140
which is fine cause it's,

3856
01:52:10,290 --> 01:52:11,160
it's amazing.

3857
01:52:11,220 --> 01:52:12,180
I mean it's a really good,

3858
01:52:12,210 --> 01:52:13,110
he's really good at it.

3859
01:52:13,111 --> 01:52:16,680
He's one of the best ranters like Dunkin.

3860
01:52:16,681 --> 01:52:18,210
Like when you do podcasts with him,

3861
01:52:18,211 --> 01:52:19,021
one of the things that happens,

3862
01:52:19,021 --> 01:52:21,110
you got to know like when to
back off and just let it go.

3863
01:52:21,120 --> 01:52:24,660
Let them rant because you don't want to
trip up what he's doing because he gets

3864
01:52:24,661 --> 01:52:29,661
in these like these like linguistic waves
that he starts riding and he just says

3865
01:52:29,971 --> 01:52:34,971
this amazing colorful way of describing
things and sometimes he'll paint a

3866
01:52:35,011 --> 01:52:38,280
picture that you wouldn't expect or you
wouldn't have ever painted without it.

3867
01:52:38,520 --> 01:52:38,820
It's,

3868
01:52:38,820 --> 01:52:39,540
and that's,

3869
01:52:39,540 --> 01:52:43,020
that's something that you don't really
do when you do stand up in a way.

3870
01:52:43,050 --> 01:52:46,250
Cause like the beauty of his style

3871
01:52:46,360 --> 01:52:46,670
of,

3872
01:52:46,670 --> 01:52:48,020
of doing podcasts,

3873
01:52:48,021 --> 01:52:52,130
the entertaining aspect of it
doesn't translate into anything else,

3874
01:52:52,131 --> 01:52:54,140
but it does a little bit to stand up.

3875
01:52:54,290 --> 01:52:58,790
But really it's just a beautiful
style of ranting about subjects.

3876
01:52:58,970 --> 01:53:00,440
That's great for a podcast.

3877
01:53:00,441 --> 01:53:03,200
It makes it look super
enjoyable and interesting.

3878
01:53:03,950 --> 01:53:04,940
But to that,

3879
01:53:04,970 --> 01:53:09,970
I think that to him is more exciting
and more fun than podcasts and it's

3880
01:53:10,821 --> 01:53:13,310
certainly reaches more
people or comedy me.

3881
01:53:13,760 --> 01:53:13,971
Yeah.

3882
01:53:13,971 --> 01:53:14,661
Then then comedy.

3883
01:53:14,661 --> 01:53:15,020
Yeah,

3884
01:53:15,020 --> 01:53:17,960
because it's certainly reaches more
people because obviously if he's doing the

3885
01:53:17,961 --> 01:53:22,670
show and unless he's putting it out on
Netflix or comedy central or something

3886
01:53:22,671 --> 01:53:23,504
like that,

3887
01:53:24,070 --> 01:53:27,470
I mean he's doing standup for a couple
hundred people at a time or a thousand

3888
01:53:27,471 --> 01:53:28,304
people at the most,

3889
01:53:28,310 --> 01:53:29,143
you know.

3890
01:53:29,420 --> 01:53:30,680
But if he's doing that podcast,

3891
01:53:30,681 --> 01:53:33,110
his podcast is hitting hundreds
of thousands every month.

3892
01:53:33,150 --> 01:53:33,340
He's,

3893
01:53:33,340 --> 01:53:34,960
he's always been one of
my favorite standups.

3894
01:53:34,970 --> 01:53:35,803
You know,

3895
01:53:36,110 --> 01:53:37,310
when we first moved out here,

3896
01:53:37,311 --> 01:53:40,820
I would like goes to almost
all his comedy shows with them,

3897
01:53:40,850 --> 01:53:41,150
you know?

3898
01:53:41,150 --> 01:53:43,290
And just because I had no friends,

3899
01:53:43,291 --> 01:53:44,124
so I'd like go with him.

3900
01:53:44,350 --> 01:53:44,620
He,

3901
01:53:44,620 --> 01:53:47,930
he's one of the funnest
people to watch on stage,

3902
01:53:47,931 --> 01:53:51,140
especially when he had little Hobo
and just like somebody stole it.

3903
01:53:51,590 --> 01:53:51,861
Yeah.

3904
01:53:51,861 --> 01:53:53,360
I know it's San Francisco,

3905
01:53:53,390 --> 01:53:54,370
but I,

3906
01:53:54,680 --> 01:53:57,590
there's people like him I
wish would do more standup.

3907
01:53:57,620 --> 01:53:58,830
Like he does Swartz in,

3908
01:53:58,831 --> 01:53:59,660
yeah.

3909
01:53:59,660 --> 01:54:00,380
I love Nick.

3910
01:54:00,380 --> 01:54:01,640
He does stand up a lot.

3911
01:54:02,450 --> 01:54:04,340
He just doesn't put anything out right.

3912
01:54:04,650 --> 01:54:07,700
And I just think he needs
to put together a special,

3913
01:54:07,790 --> 01:54:08,810
so good man.

3914
01:54:08,811 --> 01:54:09,800
He's so fucking funny.

3915
01:54:10,220 --> 01:54:10,820
But,

3916
01:54:10,820 --> 01:54:11,990
but everybody knows Dunkin.

3917
01:54:12,050 --> 01:54:12,320
You know,

3918
01:54:12,320 --> 01:54:14,870
I think a lot of people know Dunkin
because of the podcast world.

3919
01:54:15,230 --> 01:54:17,360
Ian is a guy who doesn't
really have a big,

3920
01:54:17,730 --> 01:54:19,460
he was doing something
with you for a while,

3921
01:54:19,461 --> 01:54:19,730
right?

3922
01:54:19,730 --> 01:54:23,540
The preposterous sessions kind of
do what I do with the roast battle.

3923
01:54:23,541 --> 01:54:25,610
It just replayed it on desk squad for him.

3924
01:54:25,790 --> 01:54:26,031
Oh,

3925
01:54:26,031 --> 01:54:27,550
so it was his place,

3926
01:54:27,560 --> 01:54:29,390
his initials trying to
help him out with the,

3927
01:54:29,960 --> 01:54:30,351
yeah,

3928
01:54:30,351 --> 01:54:31,190
he needs to,

3929
01:54:31,430 --> 01:54:32,390
I don't know what it is.

3930
01:54:32,391 --> 01:54:35,810
I think you just need to not write anymore
on those shows because when you write

3931
01:54:35,811 --> 01:54:36,261
on those shows,

3932
01:54:36,261 --> 01:54:37,094
you can't tour.

3933
01:54:37,130 --> 01:54:38,000
You're stuck.

3934
01:54:38,510 --> 01:54:38,841
He was,

3935
01:54:38,841 --> 01:54:42,740
he just turned down a big gig because
they told him that he couldn't pitch

3936
01:54:42,741 --> 01:54:43,574
anything else.

3937
01:54:43,670 --> 01:54:44,360
They told him,

3938
01:54:44,360 --> 01:54:44,570
uh,

3939
01:54:44,570 --> 01:54:44,781
you know,

3940
01:54:44,781 --> 01:54:47,360
Kim Kim was going through this
some shit right now with this.

3941
01:54:47,600 --> 01:54:48,433
These companies,

3942
01:54:48,740 --> 01:54:52,370
they get you and then they say
that they own you intellectually,

3943
01:54:52,371 --> 01:54:53,760
not just while you're working there.

3944
01:54:53,761 --> 01:54:55,430
Like say if you write on a show,

3945
01:54:55,580 --> 01:54:56,360
right.

3946
01:54:56,360 --> 01:54:57,140
They don't want,

3947
01:54:57,140 --> 01:55:00,170
they want you to not
just write on that show.

3948
01:55:00,320 --> 01:55:01,340
They want to own you.

3949
01:55:01,341 --> 01:55:03,500
If you have a movie script that
you're writing on the side,

3950
01:55:03,650 --> 01:55:04,431
they want to own you.

3951
01:55:04,431 --> 01:55:05,390
If you have a book,

3952
01:55:05,690 --> 01:55:08,060
they decide because they can,

3953
01:55:08,240 --> 01:55:08,780
because they're,

3954
01:55:08,780 --> 01:55:10,820
their model is kind of rotting away.

3955
01:55:11,030 --> 01:55:12,500
Like the model of the Sitcom.

3956
01:55:12,650 --> 01:55:13,490
That's a fucking,

3957
01:55:13,700 --> 01:55:16,910
they used to be a lot of
sitcoms back in the day,

3958
01:55:17,090 --> 01:55:19,220
like in the 90s when I was on news radio,

3959
01:55:19,280 --> 01:55:20,540
everything was a sitcom.

3960
01:55:20,690 --> 01:55:24,830
There was four or five sitcoms a night
and you know you had sex in the city,

3961
01:55:24,831 --> 01:55:25,970
you had friends,

3962
01:55:25,971 --> 01:55:27,020
you had the single guy,

3963
01:55:27,021 --> 01:55:29,720
you had Caroline in the
city for sex in the city.

3964
01:55:29,721 --> 01:55:30,554
I was confusing him.

3965
01:55:30,860 --> 01:55:31,030
You,

3966
01:55:31,030 --> 01:55:34,460
you know you had all these different
networks that all these different shows.

3967
01:55:34,461 --> 01:55:35,720
Everybody had sitcoms.

3968
01:55:35,840 --> 01:55:37,520
He had four or five sitcoms a week,

3969
01:55:37,521 --> 01:55:37,851
six,

3970
01:55:37,851 --> 01:55:38,930
seven sitcoms a week,

3971
01:55:39,110 --> 01:55:40,220
whatever the fuck the number was.

3972
01:55:40,221 --> 01:55:40,821
He had dramas,

3973
01:55:40,821 --> 01:55:41,654
all these different shows.

3974
01:55:41,830 --> 01:55:43,980
They're dying now.

3975
01:55:44,190 --> 01:55:45,023
They have a few,

3976
01:55:45,180 --> 01:55:47,880
you know you have like undateable this
doing that weird shit where they're

3977
01:55:47,881 --> 01:55:49,200
trying to do a live version of it.

3978
01:55:49,201 --> 01:55:49,351
Yeah.

3979
01:55:49,351 --> 01:55:50,184
We'll talk about that.

3980
01:55:50,370 --> 01:55:51,360
And then you have like,

3981
01:55:52,050 --> 01:55:56,940
I guess two broke girls is still doing
Freilla Big Bang theory is Big Bang

3982
01:55:56,941 --> 01:55:57,580
theory.

3983
01:55:57,580 --> 01:55:58,980
It seems to me like,

3984
01:55:59,460 --> 01:55:59,911
like a,

3985
01:55:59,911 --> 01:56:02,070
you know how they do that music
that they play for the Cobra,

3986
01:56:02,270 --> 01:56:05,450
Eh,

3987
01:56:05,760 --> 01:56:06,481
and then the Cobra,

3988
01:56:06,481 --> 01:56:07,830
just like he can't move,

3989
01:56:07,890 --> 01:56:09,150
he gets hypnotized by the music.

3990
01:56:09,510 --> 01:56:11,700
I think that is what happens with retards.

3991
01:56:11,701 --> 01:56:12,930
When they watched the Big Bang theory,

3992
01:56:13,320 --> 01:56:18,030
I think it's somehow or another guest
them to tune in just long enough to play

3993
01:56:18,031 --> 01:56:20,220
those commercials and
then it ends and they go,

3994
01:56:20,221 --> 01:56:20,911
what just happened?

3995
01:56:20,911 --> 01:56:21,690
And they wake up.

3996
01:56:21,690 --> 01:56:22,650
What did I just watch?

3997
01:56:24,330 --> 01:56:25,770
There's only a few now though.

3998
01:56:25,860 --> 01:56:27,000
So because of that,

3999
01:56:27,330 --> 01:56:29,880
they want to own everybody.

4000
01:56:29,910 --> 01:56:30,810
They want to own,

4001
01:56:30,900 --> 01:56:32,670
they want to own all the stuff he did.

4002
01:56:32,880 --> 01:56:33,990
Now what our friend Kim,

4003
01:56:34,170 --> 01:56:36,870
it gets even crazier because
she's not even a writer.

4004
01:56:37,050 --> 01:56:39,570
She's employed as a
secretary for a company.

4005
01:56:39,870 --> 01:56:41,610
And this the company that she's employed,

4006
01:56:41,611 --> 01:56:42,444
four options.

4007
01:56:42,660 --> 01:56:43,110
Yeah,

4008
01:56:43,110 --> 01:56:43,650
same thing.

4009
01:56:43,650 --> 01:56:44,380
Yeah.

4010
01:56:44,380 --> 01:56:49,380
The company that she's employed for wants
to own a project that she's created.

4011
01:56:49,650 --> 01:56:49,950
Well,

4012
01:56:49,950 --> 01:56:51,120
I kind of her own,

4013
01:56:51,150 --> 01:56:52,920
I kind of get where they're coming from.

4014
01:56:52,950 --> 01:56:53,820
How um,

4015
01:56:53,910 --> 01:56:57,300
because she works at a
place that there's a lot of,

4016
01:56:57,420 --> 01:56:58,920
they make a lot of shows.

4017
01:56:58,950 --> 01:56:59,311
All right.

4018
01:56:59,311 --> 01:57:02,160
So she has to interact with
a lot of important people.

4019
01:57:02,161 --> 01:57:05,010
She sees a lot of things
behind the scenes.

4020
01:57:05,220 --> 01:57:08,340
So what they do that for is
like a basic thing in Hollywood.

4021
01:57:08,341 --> 01:57:10,620
So where she can't tell
the competition like,

4022
01:57:10,800 --> 01:57:11,341
Oh hey,

4023
01:57:11,341 --> 01:57:11,731
you know,

4024
01:57:11,731 --> 01:57:15,120
a Jeff Foxworthy is going to
be on the next show and uh,

4025
01:57:15,121 --> 01:57:15,371
you know,

4026
01:57:15,371 --> 01:57:18,320
it's just a confidentiality waiver there.

4027
01:57:18,390 --> 01:57:21,330
They're pretty much saying is
that's not according to her.

4028
01:57:21,360 --> 01:57:22,171
I think you're wrong.

4029
01:57:22,171 --> 01:57:24,270
I've read what she said
and once you sent me,

4030
01:57:24,430 --> 01:57:25,150
right.

4031
01:57:25,150 --> 01:57:25,500
She,

4032
01:57:25,500 --> 01:57:25,950
she,

4033
01:57:25,950 --> 01:57:29,010
I talked to her last night and she said
she made it seem like their reasoning is

4034
01:57:29,040 --> 01:57:31,560
that they don't want
me to create like the,

4035
01:57:31,820 --> 01:57:35,970
like the like a show using
secrets that they use,

4036
01:57:35,971 --> 01:57:36,421
you know,

4037
01:57:36,421 --> 01:57:37,111
on the side,

4038
01:57:37,111 --> 01:57:37,381
you know,

4039
01:57:37,381 --> 01:57:37,770
like,

4040
01:57:37,770 --> 01:57:38,820
cause she's open.

4041
01:57:39,390 --> 01:57:40,800
She's who a lot of secrets.

4042
01:57:40,801 --> 01:57:41,410
A lot of

4043
01:57:41,410 --> 01:57:42,370
the words.

4044
01:57:42,450 --> 01:57:42,670
Yeah.

4045
01:57:42,670 --> 01:57:44,110
We own your brain.

4046
01:57:44,820 --> 01:57:45,160
Yeah,

4047
01:57:45,160 --> 01:57:45,993
that's what they said there.

4048
01:57:46,160 --> 01:57:46,620
Yeah.

4049
01:57:46,620 --> 01:57:47,261
A lot of places.

4050
01:57:47,261 --> 01:57:49,210
We own your brain while you work here.

4051
01:57:49,211 --> 01:57:50,044
We own your brain.

4052
01:57:50,260 --> 01:57:51,093
That's retarded.

4053
01:57:51,610 --> 01:57:52,360
That's retarded.

4054
01:57:52,360 --> 01:57:55,090
I don't give a fuck what
reasoning they have.

4055
01:57:55,960 --> 01:57:57,790
She's a secretary or receptionist,

4056
01:57:57,791 --> 01:57:58,061
whatever.

4057
01:57:58,061 --> 01:57:58,894
She answers phones.

4058
01:57:59,410 --> 01:58:02,950
If they wanted to sign a
confidentiality agreement you do that.

4059
01:58:03,580 --> 01:58:05,920
But the idea that they say that her,

4060
01:58:05,921 --> 01:58:06,910
we own your brain,

4061
01:58:06,940 --> 01:58:08,380
they want to own her project,

4062
01:58:08,560 --> 01:58:10,480
they want to own the
projects that she creates.

4063
01:58:10,510 --> 01:58:11,343
That particular,

4064
01:58:11,460 --> 01:58:15,660
I think things she worked for
though is very close to TV shows.

4065
01:58:15,661 --> 01:58:20,370
So like they can't have somebody just
making and TV shows based off secrets that

4066
01:58:21,010 --> 01:58:21,880
the secrets,

4067
01:58:22,390 --> 01:58:22,901
see look,

4068
01:58:22,901 --> 01:58:23,980
if you smell something,

4069
01:58:24,750 --> 01:58:25,690
but what does that look?

4070
01:58:25,691 --> 01:58:28,780
That's the purpose of her working for
some place where you making shit money

4071
01:58:28,960 --> 01:58:30,070
when you work as an intern.

4072
01:58:30,071 --> 01:58:32,620
So if you work for an intern for
the opiate Anthony show or whatever,

4073
01:58:33,480 --> 01:58:34,140
they're,

4074
01:58:34,140 --> 01:58:34,930
the reason why you're not,

4075
01:58:34,930 --> 01:58:37,600
they're not paying you shit is because
you're learning about the business.

4076
01:58:37,601 --> 01:58:37,781
Like,

4077
01:58:37,781 --> 01:58:38,230
good,

4078
01:58:38,230 --> 01:58:40,990
well we're going to not pay you anything
and then what are you going to do?

4079
01:58:41,080 --> 01:58:42,010
You got to learn shit

4080
01:58:42,010 --> 01:58:42,311
here.

4081
01:58:42,311 --> 01:58:45,400
And the figured out on your own and
then you can't be my slave anymore.

4082
01:58:45,580 --> 01:58:49,810
That's ridiculous that that company's
full of cuts that that's a country

4083
01:58:49,811 --> 01:58:50,644
company.

4084
01:58:50,920 --> 01:58:51,700
Like why?

4085
01:58:51,700 --> 01:58:52,271
Why would he,

4086
01:58:52,271 --> 01:58:53,680
why are you paying her five bucks an hour?

4087
01:58:53,681 --> 01:58:54,071
They're like wait,

4088
01:58:54,071 --> 01:58:54,461
or whatever.

4089
01:58:54,461 --> 01:58:56,390
She's getting some getting much like Wah.

4090
01:58:56,500 --> 01:58:58,190
That's the whole purpose of working in a,

4091
01:58:58,390 --> 01:59:00,670
an entry level Gig is
you supposed to learn,

4092
01:59:00,970 --> 01:59:02,560
well you're going to took it
and you're going to learn.

4093
01:59:02,561 --> 01:59:03,790
You need going to go profit elsewhere.

4094
01:59:03,910 --> 01:59:05,560
It's one thing if she steals an idea,

4095
01:59:05,710 --> 01:59:06,521
she steals an idea,

4096
01:59:06,521 --> 01:59:07,354
they should sewer.

4097
01:59:07,570 --> 01:59:09,180
But if she's not stealing ideas,

4098
01:59:09,181 --> 01:59:12,580
if she just learning about the business
and you're trying to penalize her or

4099
01:59:12,581 --> 01:59:13,030
you're trying to,

4100
01:59:13,030 --> 01:59:15,070
they're trying to own what she's doing,

4101
01:59:15,250 --> 01:59:15,581
you know,

4102
01:59:15,581 --> 01:59:17,110
not just like kinda own it,

4103
01:59:17,260 --> 01:59:18,041
but according to her,

4104
01:59:18,041 --> 01:59:19,210
they want to own it.

4105
01:59:19,450 --> 01:59:21,520
They want to own everything
she does when she works there.

4106
01:59:22,210 --> 01:59:23,043
That's crazy.

4107
01:59:23,530 --> 01:59:25,480
But that's also why he
shouldn't have a job like that.

4108
01:59:25,770 --> 01:59:26,800
She should just be a comic.

4109
01:59:27,550 --> 01:59:28,151
Just struggle.

4110
01:59:28,151 --> 01:59:28,984
Get a waitress job.

4111
01:59:28,990 --> 01:59:29,651
You know this,

4112
01:59:29,651 --> 01:59:29,920
this,

4113
01:59:29,920 --> 01:59:30,753
everybody wants to

4114
01:59:30,860 --> 01:59:32,770
like nothing wrong with waitress jobs.

4115
01:59:32,771 --> 01:59:33,550
They're fine.

4116
01:59:33,550 --> 01:59:34,383
It's good.

4117
01:59:34,840 --> 01:59:37,960
Unless you waitressing on fat
Tuesday at the comedy store.

4118
01:59:37,990 --> 01:59:38,470
Fuck,

4119
01:59:38,470 --> 01:59:39,700
that doesn't exist anymore.

4120
01:59:39,850 --> 01:59:40,870
Do you watch the daily show?

4121
01:59:40,871 --> 01:59:41,950
Do you like this new guy?

4122
01:59:42,310 --> 01:59:44,860
Cause I saw you tweet something the other
day about it and I don't know if you

4123
01:59:44,861 --> 01:59:45,161
actually,

4124
01:59:45,161 --> 01:59:46,500
I mean I tried to watch it.

4125
01:59:46,560 --> 01:59:48,490
I'm not on board with that guy.

4126
01:59:48,520 --> 01:59:49,360
I haven't seen it yet.

4127
01:59:49,670 --> 01:59:50,120
Um,

4128
01:59:50,120 --> 01:59:51,110
but there,

4129
01:59:51,170 --> 01:59:52,003
there's a,

4130
01:59:52,430 --> 01:59:53,900
there's a Russell Peters thing.

4131
01:59:54,200 --> 01:59:54,381
We're,

4132
01:59:54,381 --> 01:59:56,060
Russell Peters said
that the guy's a thief.

4133
01:59:56,300 --> 01:59:57,440
And then after he said,

4134
01:59:57,441 --> 01:59:58,274
uh,

4135
01:59:58,430 --> 01:59:58,701
you know,

4136
01:59:58,701 --> 01:59:59,960
he said the guy stole from him,

4137
01:59:59,961 --> 02:00:00,980
guys stole from someone else.

4138
02:00:01,310 --> 02:00:03,470
I saw the bit that Russell
said he stole from him.

4139
02:00:03,471 --> 02:00:04,850
It's the same exact premise.

4140
02:00:05,030 --> 02:00:06,170
And if you saw Russell do it,

4141
02:00:06,171 --> 02:00:07,430
that's probably exactly
where he got it from.

4142
02:00:08,210 --> 02:00:10,220
And then there was a thing
where he recently did a bit,

4143
02:00:10,880 --> 02:00:13,710
there was a straight up Dave
Chappelle bit from like a,

4144
02:00:13,770 --> 02:00:14,810
the early two thousands,

4145
02:00:14,811 --> 02:00:15,170
right?

4146
02:00:15,170 --> 02:00:15,800
Yeah.

4147
02:00:15,800 --> 02:00:16,290
And uh,

4148
02:00:16,290 --> 02:00:17,920
100% that was banked.

4149
02:00:18,680 --> 02:00:19,490
It was the same.

4150
02:00:19,490 --> 02:00:19,941
It wasn't,

4151
02:00:19,941 --> 02:00:21,080
it was the same wording.

4152
02:00:21,200 --> 02:00:22,220
Same premise,

4153
02:00:22,340 --> 02:00:23,150
same everything,

4154
02:00:23,150 --> 02:00:24,740
and it's a Dave Chappelle bit,

4155
02:00:24,741 --> 02:00:25,640
so you know that bit.

4156
02:00:25,850 --> 02:00:27,110
So if you're a standup comic,

4157
02:00:27,111 --> 02:00:27,944
you know that bit.

4158
02:00:28,130 --> 02:00:29,650
I mean it's like Louis C.

4159
02:00:29,650 --> 02:00:30,830
Case bag of Dicks joke.

4160
02:00:31,010 --> 02:00:34,640
There's like jokes that like you
kind of know or like a Cosby.

4161
02:00:34,700 --> 02:00:35,031
Yeah,

4162
02:00:35,031 --> 02:00:35,271
yeah.

4163
02:00:35,271 --> 02:00:37,700
The Noah's Ark bit or like a,

4164
02:00:37,790 --> 02:00:38,623
you know,

4165
02:00:38,780 --> 02:00:41,750
Richard Pryor's vampire
bit vampire in the hood.

4166
02:00:42,230 --> 02:00:43,310
You know that bit man,

4167
02:00:43,350 --> 02:00:47,630
there's a class at Sam Kinison is having
sex with the homosexual necrophiliac

4168
02:00:47,631 --> 02:00:47,961
joke.

4169
02:00:47,961 --> 02:00:48,790
That bit,

4170
02:00:48,790 --> 02:00:49,520
you know that bit.

4171
02:00:49,520 --> 02:00:50,353
People know that bit.

4172
02:00:50,390 --> 02:00:51,021
So if you,

4173
02:00:51,021 --> 02:00:52,280
if you try to steal that,

4174
02:00:52,460 --> 02:00:53,330
come on son,

4175
02:00:53,570 --> 02:00:54,403
you can't,

4176
02:00:55,060 --> 02:00:55,893
then you get it.

4177
02:00:56,030 --> 02:00:56,580
He didn't,

4178
02:00:56,580 --> 02:00:57,740
didn't mix it up a little,

4179
02:00:58,130 --> 02:00:58,521
but he,

4180
02:00:58,521 --> 02:00:59,990
he mixed it up a little with,

4181
02:00:59,991 --> 02:01:00,770
uh,

4182
02:01:00,770 --> 02:01:01,700
with Russell,

4183
02:01:01,760 --> 02:01:02,301
with Russell,

4184
02:01:02,301 --> 02:01:05,630
you could tell the origin
was most likely the same.

4185
02:01:05,750 --> 02:01:06,950
Did he probably saw Russell do it,

4186
02:01:06,951 --> 02:01:10,520
but it's a race joke
and it's vague enough.

4187
02:01:10,630 --> 02:01:11,090
So,

4188
02:01:11,090 --> 02:01:11,841
and the way he did,

4189
02:01:11,841 --> 02:01:12,200
he did,

4190
02:01:12,200 --> 02:01:13,400
he danced around it enough.

4191
02:01:13,560 --> 02:01:14,393
Yeah.

4192
02:01:14,700 --> 02:01:15,740
Russell in that interview,

4193
02:01:15,800 --> 02:01:16,141
by the way,

4194
02:01:16,141 --> 02:01:18,130
that woman that interviewed
Ralph Soul in that,

4195
02:01:18,530 --> 02:01:19,363
oh my gosh.

4196
02:01:19,560 --> 02:01:20,240
She's like,

4197
02:01:20,240 --> 02:01:24,810
she's not jealous cause he's
hotter and skinnier and skinnier.

4198
02:01:24,990 --> 02:01:25,411
Cuter.

4199
02:01:25,411 --> 02:01:26,244
She said,

4200
02:01:26,510 --> 02:01:26,940
Russell,

4201
02:01:26,940 --> 02:01:27,970
you can tell he got,

4202
02:01:27,971 --> 02:01:30,330
he also mentions another
person that he stole from.

4203
02:01:30,400 --> 02:01:32,090
I don't know any other comic is,

4204
02:01:32,100 --> 02:01:34,140
but it seems like a
smoke versus fire thing.

4205
02:01:34,141 --> 02:01:35,490
Definitely smoked smoking fire.

4206
02:01:35,550 --> 02:01:36,300
Yeah.

4207
02:01:36,300 --> 02:01:36,870
Yeah.

4208
02:01:36,870 --> 02:01:37,703
Most.

4209
02:01:37,980 --> 02:01:38,730
Most likely.

4210
02:01:38,730 --> 02:01:38,941
Yeah.

4211
02:01:38,941 --> 02:01:39,730
And he's there.

4212
02:01:39,730 --> 02:01:40,130
They're hanging

4213
02:01:40,130 --> 02:01:40,640
out though.

4214
02:01:40,640 --> 02:01:42,560
Do you think that who gives a fuck?

4215
02:01:42,890 --> 02:01:43,300
It's not,

4216
02:01:43,300 --> 02:01:44,133
it's not.

4217
02:01:44,180 --> 02:01:46,100
Dave probably doesn't read low Internet.

4218
02:01:46,410 --> 02:01:47,470
He's probably not even online.

4219
02:01:48,110 --> 02:01:48,750
Yeah,

4220
02:01:48,750 --> 02:01:49,520
it's true.

4221
02:01:49,520 --> 02:01:50,690
Probably has no idea it happened.

4222
02:01:51,020 --> 02:01:51,591
People getting,

4223
02:01:51,591 --> 02:01:52,011
Damn.

4224
02:01:52,011 --> 02:01:52,300
I was like,

4225
02:01:52,300 --> 02:01:53,050
hmm.

4226
02:01:53,050 --> 02:01:54,320
So they stole his jokes,

4227
02:01:54,321 --> 02:01:55,070
but their friends.

4228
02:01:55,070 --> 02:01:55,251
Well,

4229
02:01:55,251 --> 02:01:55,551
okay.

4230
02:01:55,551 --> 02:01:56,121
First of all,

4231
02:01:56,121 --> 02:01:58,280
if you're a calculated
guy like Trevor Noah,

4232
02:01:58,520 --> 02:01:59,353
right?

4233
02:01:59,480 --> 02:02:01,280
Why wouldn't you do that
when you put this up,

4234
02:02:01,430 --> 02:02:04,490
what is it a fucking coincidence that
a couple of days later he takes his

4235
02:02:04,491 --> 02:02:07,490
picture with Dave and who knows
when this picture happened?

4236
02:02:07,870 --> 02:02:08,171
When?

4237
02:02:08,171 --> 02:02:09,710
When did this picture take place?

4238
02:02:10,880 --> 02:02:11,451
Did the pig,

4239
02:02:11,451 --> 02:02:13,160
but did the photo get taken yesterday?

4240
02:02:13,550 --> 02:02:17,870
They went out to dinner or lunch yesterday
before that Mark Twain thing that

4241
02:02:17,871 --> 02:02:18,810
Eddie Murphy was just app.

4242
02:02:18,811 --> 02:02:20,000
There's a bunch of comedians together.

4243
02:02:20,090 --> 02:02:20,780
Well who,

4244
02:02:20,780 --> 02:02:21,350
okay,

4245
02:02:21,350 --> 02:02:22,310
well maybe he,

4246
02:02:22,311 --> 02:02:22,700
uh,

4247
02:02:22,700 --> 02:02:23,120
you know,

4248
02:02:23,120 --> 02:02:25,880
got together with day because he wanted
to talk to him about it and tell him he

4249
02:02:25,881 --> 02:02:26,990
had no idea or blah,

4250
02:02:26,991 --> 02:02:27,141
blah,

4251
02:02:27,141 --> 02:02:27,321
blah,

4252
02:02:27,321 --> 02:02:27,471
blah,

4253
02:02:27,471 --> 02:02:28,100
blah.

4254
02:02:28,100 --> 02:02:29,510
But when Russell did it,

4255
02:02:29,511 --> 02:02:34,511
Russell said that he had this massive
media backlash after he said the guy was a

4256
02:02:35,061 --> 02:02:37,220
thief and then he said it was a prank.

4257
02:02:37,340 --> 02:02:38,360
He said it was a prank.

4258
02:02:38,720 --> 02:02:41,570
Now in the interest of confidentiality,

4259
02:02:41,720 --> 02:02:42,920
I will go no further.

4260
02:02:43,070 --> 02:02:43,490
Right.

4261
02:02:43,490 --> 02:02:45,110
But you can fucking do the math.

4262
02:02:45,140 --> 02:02:50,140
I think my personal gas would
be that it wasn't a prank.

4263
02:02:50,930 --> 02:02:51,640
Well,

4264
02:02:51,640 --> 02:02:52,760
we don't need to go further.

4265
02:02:52,980 --> 02:02:54,800
That's what go no further means Brian.

4266
02:02:55,790 --> 02:02:56,061
But,

4267
02:02:56,061 --> 02:02:56,420
uh,

4268
02:02:56,420 --> 02:02:56,860
you know,

4269
02:02:56,860 --> 02:02:58,580
Russell's the nicest fucking
guy on the planet earth.

4270
02:02:58,610 --> 02:02:59,443
He really is.

4271
02:02:59,540 --> 02:03:01,190
If Russell Peter says
you're a piece of shit,

4272
02:03:01,450 --> 02:03:01,701
I,

4273
02:03:01,701 --> 02:03:02,534
I tend to,

4274
02:03:02,660 --> 02:03:03,500
I tend to agree.

4275
02:03:03,950 --> 02:03:05,000
I usually,

4276
02:03:05,080 --> 02:03:05,271
I mean,

4277
02:03:05,271 --> 02:03:05,930
I don't know,

4278
02:03:05,930 --> 02:03:08,330
but it's whatever,

4279
02:03:08,331 --> 02:03:08,820
man.

4280
02:03:08,820 --> 02:03:09,170
You know,

4281
02:03:09,170 --> 02:03:12,080
you also got to realize this fucking
dude was doing it in South Africa.

4282
02:03:12,320 --> 02:03:13,430
That's like being on the moon.

4283
02:03:13,670 --> 02:03:15,020
It's like doing standup on the moon.

4284
02:03:15,200 --> 02:03:16,970
I mean there's a few
comics there I'm sure,

4285
02:03:16,971 --> 02:03:20,000
but they're seen is it's so,

4286
02:03:20,620 --> 02:03:25,620
it might have been their style to do other
people shit and I'm a not exonerating

4287
02:03:27,471 --> 02:03:28,304
him in any way,

4288
02:03:28,370 --> 02:03:30,830
but you got to think
like if you're at a band,

4289
02:03:30,890 --> 02:03:33,080
okay and you're in fucking Florida,

4290
02:03:33,500 --> 02:03:34,333
guess what?

4291
02:03:34,490 --> 02:03:36,290
You're going to do other people's music.

4292
02:03:36,560 --> 02:03:36,861
You know,

4293
02:03:36,861 --> 02:03:40,400
if you really want to be a big band and
you're learning and one day you guys

4294
02:03:40,401 --> 02:03:41,234
want to be huge,

4295
02:03:41,240 --> 02:03:45,080
you're going to do some cover
songs and in the world of stand up,

4296
02:03:45,110 --> 02:03:47,180
you don't do that in
the world of stand up.

4297
02:03:47,210 --> 02:03:48,170
You can't get away with that.

4298
02:03:48,171 --> 02:03:53,171
But I guarantee you there are some people
right now that could be really good

4299
02:03:53,331 --> 02:03:57,680
comedians some day and they're in some
really obscure market in the middle of

4300
02:03:57,681 --> 02:03:58,101
nowhere.

4301
02:03:58,101 --> 02:04:03,101
Or perhaps they're in some place that
speaks Dutch or some places speaks French

4302
02:04:03,500 --> 02:04:05,600
and they're stealing some
bill Cosby bit right now,

4303
02:04:05,601 --> 02:04:07,280
or they're stealing some
bill hicks bid right now.

4304
02:04:07,340 --> 02:04:09,140
That was always a big thing with Hicks.

4305
02:04:09,780 --> 02:04:10,880
There was a guy in Amsterdam,

4306
02:04:11,090 --> 02:04:14,750
there was doing standup and Dutch and he
was just stealing all of Bill Hicks is

4307
02:04:14,751 --> 02:04:15,440
shit.

4308
02:04:15,440 --> 02:04:18,590
But some other guy who is bilingual
realized it and it was like,

4309
02:04:18,591 --> 02:04:20,450
what is this in Montreal?

4310
02:04:20,451 --> 02:04:21,440
It's a huge issue.

4311
02:04:21,740 --> 02:04:23,920
The French people up there like the,

4312
02:04:23,921 --> 02:04:28,390
the French speaking to do French speaking
shows and these guys will just gag

4313
02:04:28,400 --> 02:04:29,420
dude's material,

4314
02:04:29,540 --> 02:04:32,930
just Yank American's material and
just translate it into France.

4315
02:04:33,180 --> 02:04:34,550
They don't leave that area.

4316
02:04:34,820 --> 02:04:35,250
It's a,

4317
02:04:35,250 --> 02:04:38,490
it's a very centralized area

4318
02:04:38,640 --> 02:04:40,770
like Montreal and Quebec.

4319
02:04:40,800 --> 02:04:41,633
Totally like they,

4320
02:04:41,790 --> 02:04:42,960
they're very proud.

4321
02:04:42,961 --> 02:04:47,010
There's a giant population of French
speaking people and you can get away with

4322
02:04:47,011 --> 02:04:49,530
doing a French speaking act
and steal a bunch of shit.

4323
02:04:50,040 --> 02:04:52,800
But if they are doing that,

4324
02:04:52,801 --> 02:04:53,370
man,

4325
02:04:53,370 --> 02:04:54,510
if they're listening to this,

4326
02:04:54,780 --> 02:04:55,650
you got to stop.

4327
02:04:55,930 --> 02:04:57,120
It's gonna fuck you up.

4328
02:04:57,510 --> 02:04:58,410
It's going to ruin you.

4329
02:04:59,280 --> 02:05:00,270
It's going to fuck you up.

4330
02:05:00,300 --> 02:05:00,960
Even if you know,

4331
02:05:00,960 --> 02:05:02,400
even if you're getting away with it now,

4332
02:05:02,760 --> 02:05:03,031
you'll,

4333
02:05:03,031 --> 02:05:07,980
you'll develop tendencies and you're
going to want to steal when things aren't

4334
02:05:07,981 --> 02:05:08,814
going well.

4335
02:05:08,820 --> 02:05:09,181
You know,

4336
02:05:09,181 --> 02:05:11,730
and that's those moments when
things aren't going well.

4337
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:13,740
That's what defines you as a comic.

4338
02:05:14,340 --> 02:05:15,930
That's what pulls you out of the fire.

4339
02:05:16,560 --> 02:05:20,550
There's moments I will tank bits on
purpose when I'm working on shit.

4340
02:05:20,850 --> 02:05:23,100
I will take the energy down.

4341
02:05:23,340 --> 02:05:23,881
I will,

4342
02:05:23,881 --> 02:05:27,330
I will put myself in bad positions
because it's the only way you will.

4343
02:05:27,390 --> 02:05:31,740
You learn how to get out
of them and figure out what
if I don't believe in a bit

4344
02:05:31,741 --> 02:05:32,550
that much.

4345
02:05:32,550 --> 02:05:36,630
I'll do a strong part of a bit and then
I'll back off of it and almost like put

4346
02:05:36,631 --> 02:05:40,860
myself in a scared spot where I have to
flail around to try to find a punchline.

4347
02:05:41,040 --> 02:05:45,150
I always have another bit on the ready
to jump in with to to bring the crowd

4348
02:05:45,151 --> 02:05:45,451
back,

4349
02:05:45,451 --> 02:05:48,150
but if you don't do that
and everybody does that,

4350
02:05:48,151 --> 02:05:49,230
Diaz does it that way.

4351
02:05:49,231 --> 02:05:49,471
Our,

4352
02:05:49,471 --> 02:05:50,400
he does it that way.

4353
02:05:50,640 --> 02:05:51,840
A lot of people do it that way.

4354
02:05:51,841 --> 02:05:52,260
We all,

4355
02:05:52,260 --> 02:05:53,370
we've talked about it.

4356
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:57,330
We do it that way because that's the
way you find CHIBE got to go out in the

4357
02:05:57,331 --> 02:06:00,420
deep water and people don't
want to go on that deep water.

4358
02:06:00,810 --> 02:06:01,350
They,

4359
02:06:01,350 --> 02:06:02,580
those guys who steal,

4360
02:06:02,610 --> 02:06:04,230
they never go in that deep water man.

4361
02:06:04,380 --> 02:06:04,861
They get,

4362
02:06:04,861 --> 02:06:09,480
they go into those shallow kill zones
and they elect to have these tight,

4363
02:06:09,660 --> 02:06:13,080
nice short chopping sets where they,

4364
02:06:13,081 --> 02:06:14,250
there's no pause,

4365
02:06:14,370 --> 02:06:14,641
Bam,

4366
02:06:14,641 --> 02:06:14,851
Bam,

4367
02:06:14,851 --> 02:06:15,091
Bam,

4368
02:06:15,091 --> 02:06:15,691
next joke.

4369
02:06:15,691 --> 02:06:16,081
Oh my God.

4370
02:06:16,081 --> 02:06:17,610
Was that a pause or they not laughing?

4371
02:06:17,670 --> 02:06:18,810
Fuck steel.

4372
02:06:18,960 --> 02:06:21,930
And then they'll jump in with a
steel and that's dementia approach.

4373
02:06:22,140 --> 02:06:22,973
That's why when men see,

4374
02:06:22,990 --> 02:06:24,060
would always say he never,

4375
02:06:24,061 --> 02:06:25,200
he never bombed ever.

4376
02:06:25,660 --> 02:06:26,760
Everybody.

4377
02:06:26,820 --> 02:06:27,900
Everybody was like,

4378
02:06:27,901 --> 02:06:28,350
what?

4379
02:06:28,350 --> 02:06:29,160
Never.

4380
02:06:29,160 --> 02:06:30,810
You never bombed dude.

4381
02:06:30,811 --> 02:06:34,080
Chappelle bombed a year ago and
there's a video of it online.

4382
02:06:34,350 --> 02:06:38,310
He in 22,000 people and if he's not
the best comic in the world today,

4383
02:06:38,400 --> 02:06:39,450
he's top three,

4384
02:06:39,600 --> 02:06:40,260
right?

4385
02:06:40,260 --> 02:06:41,430
I think the best is Joey.

4386
02:06:41,970 --> 02:06:42,960
But Joey's bombed.

4387
02:06:43,170 --> 02:06:43,671
I've seen Joe.

4388
02:06:43,671 --> 02:06:44,670
Joey called me the other day,

4389
02:06:44,671 --> 02:06:45,001
told me,

4390
02:06:45,001 --> 02:06:45,900
bombed in Toledo.

4391
02:06:46,050 --> 02:06:47,280
Those fucking white people,

4392
02:06:47,281 --> 02:06:48,114
Joe Rogan,

4393
02:06:48,180 --> 02:06:50,430
those fucking white people hated me.

4394
02:06:50,700 --> 02:06:51,630
He goes to desk squat.

4395
02:06:51,631 --> 02:06:52,321
People came out,

4396
02:06:52,321 --> 02:06:53,580
but those fucking white people,

4397
02:06:53,730 --> 02:06:54,511
oh my God,

4398
02:06:54,511 --> 02:06:55,344
they hated me.

4399
02:06:55,440 --> 02:06:56,370
He was in Toledo.

4400
02:06:56,730 --> 02:06:57,600
But you see what I'm saying?

4401
02:06:57,601 --> 02:06:58,150
And he's,

4402
02:06:58,150 --> 02:06:58,983
in my opinion,

4403
02:06:59,220 --> 02:07:01,770
I think Joey's the funniest
guy I've ever seen in my life.

4404
02:07:01,890 --> 02:07:05,460
I've never seen anybody that makes me
laugh as hard as he does and even he can

4405
02:07:05,461 --> 02:07:06,180
still bomb.

4406
02:07:06,180 --> 02:07:08,850
You can just cause he's
out there doing it.

4407
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:10,050
He's got notebooks,

4408
02:07:10,051 --> 02:07:11,880
he's fucking flinging jokes around.

4409
02:07:12,030 --> 02:07:14,670
You have his days where you're
on days where you're off.

4410
02:07:15,450 --> 02:07:18,720
That's part of developing
and it's constant.

4411
02:07:18,990 --> 02:07:19,860
It keeps going.

4412
02:07:20,280 --> 02:07:22,140
So these guys like these Trevor Noah Katz,

4413
02:07:22,141 --> 02:07:22,974
man,

4414
02:07:23,790 --> 02:07:25,050
if that's your tendency,

4415
02:07:25,350 --> 02:07:26,183
you're going to keep what?

4416
02:07:26,240 --> 02:07:28,230
He's going to be very hard
for that dude to break.

4417
02:07:28,310 --> 02:07:28,890
Yeah,

4418
02:07:28,890 --> 02:07:29,723
that's it's getting,

4419
02:07:29,790 --> 02:07:32,820
he might be able to break that
tendency because he's famous now.

4420
02:07:32,940 --> 02:07:36,250
He might be able to hire writers and he's
smart and he's obviously calculating,

4421
02:07:36,251 --> 02:07:37,630
which is why I put that photo up.

4422
02:07:37,900 --> 02:07:40,180
He didn't put that photo up
as a fucking coincidence.

4423
02:07:40,330 --> 02:07:41,140
You think he's like,

4424
02:07:41,140 --> 02:07:41,381
oh,

4425
02:07:41,381 --> 02:07:42,340
I didn't even know that.

4426
02:07:42,341 --> 02:07:45,790
People were thinking that I stole that
bit and please everybody fucking knows.

4427
02:07:46,060 --> 02:07:47,020
Everybody knows.

4428
02:07:47,021 --> 02:07:49,030
He knows that everybody
knows and he's made,

4429
02:07:49,060 --> 02:07:51,550
he made a calculated effort to put up at,

4430
02:07:51,551 --> 02:07:53,710
makes me more suspicious of them.

4431
02:07:54,250 --> 02:07:57,040
More suspicious if Dave
Chappelle put that picture up,

4432
02:07:57,400 --> 02:07:58,001
I would be like,

4433
02:07:58,001 --> 02:07:58,540
Dave's fuck.

4434
02:07:58,540 --> 02:07:59,170
I would be like,

4435
02:07:59,170 --> 02:08:00,460
what does Dave doing here?

4436
02:08:00,590 --> 02:08:05,590
Is he laughing is as an inside joke but
him doing it makes me more suspicious.

4437
02:08:07,060 --> 02:08:08,020
It's hard out there for a pimp.

4438
02:08:08,021 --> 02:08:08,854
Brian Read Ben,

4439
02:08:08,890 --> 02:08:11,350
you know when you going
to put together a special

4440
02:08:12,350 --> 02:08:12,831
I need to.

4441
02:08:12,831 --> 02:08:13,700
I just need to do it.

4442
02:08:14,090 --> 02:08:14,441
Yeah,

4443
02:08:14,441 --> 02:08:15,410
and I have the material.

4444
02:08:15,440 --> 02:08:17,810
I stopped half,

4445
02:08:17,810 --> 02:08:19,310
like half hour's worth
of material recently.

4446
02:08:19,640 --> 02:08:20,473
What do you mean he stopped?

4447
02:08:20,480 --> 02:08:21,410
I just stopped doing it.

4448
02:08:21,580 --> 02:08:22,640
But you have it written down.

4449
02:08:22,760 --> 02:08:22,971
I mean,

4450
02:08:22,971 --> 02:08:23,181
yeah,

4451
02:08:23,181 --> 02:08:26,990
I have it recorded and it's on video.

4452
02:08:27,100 --> 02:08:28,370
You should totally put something out.

4453
02:08:29,030 --> 02:08:29,863
Put something out.

4454
02:08:30,230 --> 02:08:32,300
Some guy just advertise
the other day on Twitter,

4455
02:08:32,301 --> 02:08:34,550
like $1,500 four camera shoot.

4456
02:08:34,551 --> 02:08:36,640
We'll make your comedy special
or something like that.

4457
02:08:36,670 --> 02:08:36,860
You know,

4458
02:08:36,860 --> 02:08:37,693
100 bucks like,

4459
02:08:37,770 --> 02:08:37,980
Hey,

4460
02:08:37,980 --> 02:08:39,200
I should just do that for fun.

4461
02:08:39,650 --> 02:08:40,610
Does he know what he's doing?

4462
02:08:40,790 --> 02:08:41,241
I don't know.

4463
02:08:41,241 --> 02:08:41,691
Probably.

4464
02:08:41,691 --> 02:08:43,160
It's so easy nowadays.

4465
02:08:43,460 --> 02:08:43,850
I mean,

4466
02:08:43,850 --> 02:08:46,550
I may remember when I used to go
on the road with you all the time,

4467
02:08:46,551 --> 02:08:47,900
I would bring three cameras,

4468
02:08:47,901 --> 02:08:48,860
have a front back,

4469
02:08:48,861 --> 02:08:49,641
two sides.

4470
02:08:49,641 --> 02:08:50,290
And that was,

4471
02:08:50,290 --> 02:08:52,400
those were shitty little
old school cameras.

4472
02:08:52,401 --> 02:08:54,230
Two in comparison to
what's available today.

4473
02:08:54,260 --> 02:08:54,830
Yeah.

4474
02:08:54,830 --> 02:08:57,500
But we were on kind of on top
of the game on all the cameras.

4475
02:08:57,501 --> 02:09:00,720
You would always upgrade them
to like the best Sony Cams.

4476
02:09:01,930 --> 02:09:02,541
But yeah,

4477
02:09:02,541 --> 02:09:03,051
I think,

4478
02:09:03,051 --> 02:09:03,860
um,

4479
02:09:03,860 --> 02:09:05,330
my next one that I'm going to do,

4480
02:09:05,630 --> 02:09:07,880
which I'm going to probably
do within the next six months,

4481
02:09:08,180 --> 02:09:09,770
I'm working out all the details right now.

4482
02:09:10,010 --> 02:09:11,390
I think I'm going to
do it at the Ice House.

4483
02:09:11,830 --> 02:09:13,490
I'm at the Ice House on October 30th,

4484
02:09:13,491 --> 02:09:13,641
too,

4485
02:09:13,641 --> 02:09:14,360
by the way.

4486
02:09:14,360 --> 02:09:15,193
Me and Ian.

4487
02:09:15,280 --> 02:09:15,660
Um,

4488
02:09:15,660 --> 02:09:18,110
and maybe Diaz might stop
by for the 10 o'clock show,

4489
02:09:18,230 --> 02:09:18,920
but,

4490
02:09:18,920 --> 02:09:19,753
um,

4491
02:09:20,930 --> 02:09:21,650
I think,

4492
02:09:21,650 --> 02:09:22,131
I think,

4493
02:09:22,131 --> 02:09:22,430
um,

4494
02:09:22,430 --> 02:09:23,241
that's the future.

4495
02:09:23,241 --> 02:09:26,390
I think the future is just doing it
old school at a club and you know,

4496
02:09:26,391 --> 02:09:30,260
having the production value be in the
quality of the video itself so that it

4497
02:09:30,261 --> 02:09:32,840
captures the room as
accurately as possible.

4498
02:09:33,020 --> 02:09:36,740
But don't try to make it like this big
swooping camera and all that bullshit.

4499
02:09:36,741 --> 02:09:38,750
I want people to feel like
they're sitting down in the crowd.

4500
02:09:39,060 --> 02:09:41,600
And I think the only way to do
that is to put it in a small spot.

4501
02:09:42,220 --> 02:09:42,950
Cause uh,

4502
02:09:42,950 --> 02:09:43,783
you know,

4503
02:09:43,790 --> 02:09:45,140
I'll do big shows,

4504
02:09:45,320 --> 02:09:47,180
I'll do these big shows and they're fun.

4505
02:09:47,181 --> 02:09:48,380
Man Theaters are fun.

4506
02:09:48,530 --> 02:09:49,970
It's a different kind of experience.

4507
02:09:50,300 --> 02:09:51,041
But the,

4508
02:09:51,041 --> 02:09:51,861
the real show,

4509
02:09:51,861 --> 02:09:53,450
we all know the real,

4510
02:09:53,470 --> 02:09:57,710
the really fun show that's
going to translate into
sitting at home and watching

4511
02:09:57,711 --> 02:09:59,270
it is like 200 at a comedy club,

4512
02:09:59,290 --> 02:10:00,190
especially Ice House.

4513
02:10:00,220 --> 02:10:01,360
I love the Ice House so much.

4514
02:10:01,361 --> 02:10:01,661
I had some,

4515
02:10:01,661 --> 02:10:03,040
one of my favorite sets Friday,

4516
02:10:03,041 --> 02:10:07,510
just do stuff and just
positive people go their staff,

4517
02:10:07,550 --> 02:10:08,860
everything's awesome man.

4518
02:10:09,250 --> 02:10:10,880
Well it's got 65 fucking

4519
02:10:10,880 --> 02:10:13,220
years of comedy burned into the walls too,

4520
02:10:13,310 --> 02:10:14,143
you know.

4521
02:10:14,240 --> 02:10:17,270
And also I think I learned
something from doing that.

4522
02:10:17,271 --> 02:10:18,350
A comedy central special,

4523
02:10:18,351 --> 02:10:19,280
the rocky mountain high.

4524
02:10:19,640 --> 02:10:19,881
I'm like,

4525
02:10:19,881 --> 02:10:20,714
that's the way to do it.

4526
02:10:20,840 --> 02:10:24,740
That felt more to me like a regular
set than anything else I've ever done.

4527
02:10:24,920 --> 02:10:26,000
You could see the audience,

4528
02:10:26,001 --> 02:10:27,320
the right there on top of me,

4529
02:10:27,530 --> 02:10:28,070
you know,

4530
02:10:28,070 --> 02:10:28,790
it was fun.

4531
02:10:28,790 --> 02:10:29,623
That's the way to do it.

4532
02:10:30,080 --> 02:10:31,460
And the ice house is
even better than that.

4533
02:10:31,461 --> 02:10:32,630
Ice Houses our home too,

4534
02:10:32,631 --> 02:10:32,811
you know,

4535
02:10:32,811 --> 02:10:33,860
that's home base.

4536
02:10:34,220 --> 02:10:36,920
Other than the comedy store that
that place feels like home to me.

4537
02:10:37,550 --> 02:10:38,600
Even I do the factory,

4538
02:10:38,601 --> 02:10:39,530
I've done the laugh factory.

4539
02:10:39,920 --> 02:10:42,740
Who knows how many times over
decades still always feels weird.

4540
02:10:42,850 --> 02:10:43,790
Yeah man,

4541
02:10:44,680 --> 02:10:45,950
the Improv is pretty cool,

4542
02:10:45,951 --> 02:10:46,760
but that's not,

4543
02:10:46,760 --> 02:10:47,120
you know,

4544
02:10:47,120 --> 02:10:47,953
it's not the same.

4545
02:10:48,230 --> 02:10:50,660
The Ice House to me is like
right up there with the store.

4546
02:10:50,990 --> 02:10:51,560
Yeah,

4547
02:10:51,560 --> 02:10:52,140
absolutely.

4548
02:10:52,140 --> 02:10:52,973
Yeah.

4549
02:10:54,620 --> 02:10:54,860
Damn.

4550
02:10:54,860 --> 02:10:59,510
Germany orders recalled 8.5 million
Volkswagens said they recall yours.

4551
02:10:59,780 --> 02:11:00,740
I don't have that anymore.

4552
02:11:00,830 --> 02:11:01,301
I got rid of it.

4553
02:11:01,301 --> 02:11:02,134
You got rid of it?

4554
02:11:02,270 --> 02:11:03,103
Yeah,

4555
02:11:03,110 --> 02:11:03,651
they uh,

4556
02:11:03,651 --> 02:11:04,371
they fucked up.

4557
02:11:04,371 --> 02:11:05,210
They tried to lie.

4558
02:11:05,810 --> 02:11:07,550
I think I figured out what
car when want get though.

4559
02:11:08,210 --> 02:11:09,950
I three that BMW I,

4560
02:11:09,980 --> 02:11:10,700
those are dope.

4561
02:11:10,700 --> 02:11:12,510
They look like an iPhone on wheels.

4562
02:11:12,810 --> 02:11:13,640
It looks cool.

4563
02:11:13,640 --> 02:11:13,881
Yeah.

4564
02:11:13,881 --> 02:11:14,714
Those are pretty dope.

4565
02:11:14,750 --> 02:11:18,380
I think my way to get a
used one kind of expensive.

4566
02:11:18,420 --> 02:11:18,540
Oh,

4567
02:11:18,540 --> 02:11:19,373
are they?

4568
02:11:19,520 --> 02:11:21,230
I heard those things
break down a lot though.

4569
02:11:21,230 --> 02:11:22,070
Is that it right there?

4570
02:11:22,960 --> 02:11:24,770
That's the video that
autopilot from Tesla.

4571
02:11:24,830 --> 02:11:25,730
Oh Jesus.

4572
02:11:25,731 --> 02:11:26,211
Play this.

4573
02:11:26,211 --> 02:11:28,640
So this is something we've got to leave
on this cause I gotta get Outta here.

4574
02:11:28,790 --> 02:11:30,680
So this is some update.

4575
02:11:30,770 --> 02:11:32,930
Jamie when she explained
the update because Tesla,

4576
02:11:32,990 --> 02:11:34,160
they did an over the air update,

4577
02:11:34,161 --> 02:11:35,990
which is something that I
didn't know that they could do,

4578
02:11:35,991 --> 02:11:38,630
but they said they're going to do it
multiple times and I think it's just in

4579
02:11:38,631 --> 02:11:39,500
Beta right now.

4580
02:11:39,810 --> 02:11:40,460
Um,

4581
02:11:40,460 --> 02:11:44,480
so Tesla has an auto pilot
and also an auto park.

4582
02:11:45,280 --> 02:11:47,870
The autopilot think it's just
made for the freeway right now,

4583
02:11:47,900 --> 02:11:51,140
but they've been testing it and
there's some videos showing it used in,

4584
02:11:51,170 --> 02:11:51,650
uh,

4585
02:11:51,650 --> 02:11:53,510
like in New York on 12th Avenue.

4586
02:11:53,810 --> 02:11:54,321
And this is,

4587
02:11:54,321 --> 02:11:58,790
I think this looks like it's back on
like a movie lot and they're showing the,

4588
02:11:58,791 --> 02:11:59,420
uh,

4589
02:11:59,420 --> 02:11:59,840
that,

4590
02:11:59,840 --> 02:12:01,190
that crazy button first.

4591
02:12:01,220 --> 02:12:05,180
So it shoots up to 75 miles an hour and
then it's going to go into autopilot

4592
02:12:05,181 --> 02:12:08,510
mode and you see it like a read street
signs and it's reading the white lines on

4593
02:12:08,511 --> 02:12:09,220
the road.

4594
02:12:09,220 --> 02:12:13,520
She kind of moved her car and then at
the very end it will stop it as it sees a

4595
02:12:13,521 --> 02:12:14,510
car in front of it too.

4596
02:12:15,890 --> 02:12:16,470
I hope this,

4597
02:12:16,470 --> 02:12:17,900
this is video from slash gear,

4598
02:12:17,901 --> 02:12:18,411
so this was,

4599
02:12:18,411 --> 02:12:19,970
shouldn't bother us too much,

4600
02:12:19,971 --> 02:12:21,200
but wow.

4601
02:12:23,480 --> 02:12:24,440
Just full door.

4602
02:12:24,680 --> 02:12:26,850
Sit down and we started over to there.

4603
02:12:27,530 --> 02:12:28,820
They're getting ready to launch right now.

4604
02:12:32,650 --> 02:12:33,483
So

4605
02:12:36,090 --> 02:12:38,070
just look at that fucking screen.

4606
02:12:38,580 --> 02:12:40,080
This is on autopilot right now.

4607
02:12:40,610 --> 02:12:40,880
Yeah,

4608
02:12:40,880 --> 02:12:41,713
that's fast.

4609
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:42,441
Trust.

4610
02:12:42,441 --> 02:12:43,274
Just follow.

4611
02:12:43,470 --> 02:12:44,281
Sit down in the world.

4612
02:12:44,281 --> 02:12:45,550
You say never.

4613
02:12:46,140 --> 02:12:47,300
This is not driving itself.

4614
02:12:47,301 --> 02:12:50,940
I mean you can't as can turn
on the autopilot system.

4615
02:12:51,750 --> 02:12:52,583
Engaging it now.

4616
02:12:53,220 --> 02:12:54,053
Wow.

4617
02:12:54,500 --> 02:12:55,450
Queriness so cool.

4618
02:12:55,750 --> 02:12:56,820
The accelerator,

4619
02:12:57,420 --> 02:13:00,930
the car will observe the 30 mile
an hour sign and increase in speed.

4620
02:13:00,990 --> 02:13:02,340
As we go through this bend.

4621
02:13:03,450 --> 02:13:08,450
I'd be texting like a motherfucker right
now on the road and as it observes this

4622
02:13:08,491 --> 02:13:10,020
25 mile an hour speed,

4623
02:13:10,530 --> 02:13:15,120
it's going to reduce Jesus Christ and
it click the turn signal on where people

4624
02:13:15,121 --> 02:13:17,460
are going to fuck around
and put 90 on those things.

4625
02:13:17,730 --> 02:13:19,710
Just taping it and now the nine,

4626
02:13:19,711 --> 02:13:21,360
the car over the too nice.

4627
02:13:21,380 --> 02:13:22,230
So many problems.

4628
02:13:22,231 --> 02:13:23,430
I can see just with like,

4629
02:13:23,690 --> 02:13:24,480
but I'm sure they've thought

4630
02:13:24,480 --> 02:13:26,400
there are a lot of things but wow,

4631
02:13:27,630 --> 02:13:28,440
that's so,

4632
02:13:28,440 --> 02:13:30,230
oh that's amazing.

4633
02:13:32,460 --> 02:13:32,980
This guy,

4634
02:13:32,980 --> 02:13:37,290
Elon Musk is freaking me out because
it makes me feel really stupid,

4635
02:13:37,770 --> 02:13:41,970
really stupid and really unambitious
and really insignificant.

4636
02:13:42,120 --> 02:13:44,730
When I see him with his beautifully
tailored suits and he's talking about

4637
02:13:44,731 --> 02:13:45,451
changing the world.

4638
02:13:45,451 --> 02:13:45,810
I'm like,

4639
02:13:45,810 --> 02:13:47,580
am I looking at Tony Stark for real?

4640
02:13:47,850 --> 02:13:48,450
This is like,

4641
02:13:48,450 --> 02:13:50,130
when is he going to come
out with an iron man suit?

4642
02:13:50,270 --> 02:13:50,640
Right.

4643
02:13:50,640 --> 02:13:52,950
Cause he's gonna you know
that fucks got one already.

4644
02:13:53,430 --> 02:13:54,840
He's probably gotten one
already in his basement.

4645
02:13:54,841 --> 02:13:55,710
He's probably all Adderall.

4646
02:13:55,720 --> 02:13:57,300
Dot Steve Jobs too.

4647
02:13:57,301 --> 02:13:57,710
Right?

4648
02:13:57,710 --> 02:13:59,730
Like he's more than to see jobs to me.

4649
02:13:59,810 --> 02:14:00,211
Write to me,

4650
02:14:00,211 --> 02:14:02,760
he's way more innovative because
what Steve Jobs did was amazing,

4651
02:14:02,761 --> 02:14:04,350
but it was all in the world of computing,

4652
02:14:04,560 --> 02:14:07,950
which is arguably the reason why this
guy is able to do this in the first place

4653
02:14:08,250 --> 02:14:11,460
is because he's incredibly powerful
computers and the access to them and

4654
02:14:11,700 --> 02:14:15,390
changing the way people use the Internet
is probably what started this all off

4655
02:14:15,391 --> 02:14:16,020
in the first place.

4656
02:14:16,020 --> 02:14:20,150
But what he's doing between this
and the bullet trains like keys.

4657
02:14:20,180 --> 02:14:24,570
He's going to create these magnetic
trains that can go across the country in a

4658
02:14:24,571 --> 02:14:26,310
fraction of the time it takes to fly.

4659
02:14:26,370 --> 02:14:27,830
What kind of plan do
you think he flies in?

4660
02:14:27,840 --> 02:14:28,531
Something crazy.

4661
02:14:28,531 --> 02:14:29,010
Sorry.

4662
02:14:29,010 --> 02:14:30,390
Stealth bomber type shit.

4663
02:14:30,590 --> 02:14:31,200
Yeah.

4664
02:14:31,200 --> 02:14:31,771
Who knows,

4665
02:14:31,771 --> 02:14:32,041
man.

4666
02:14:32,041 --> 02:14:33,630
He's probably got some ridiculous jet.

4667
02:14:33,660 --> 02:14:34,493
Gs Six.

4668
02:14:34,680 --> 02:14:36,420
Imagine electric plane.

4669
02:14:36,440 --> 02:14:36,630
Madge,

4670
02:14:36,630 --> 02:14:37,820
he's been flying electric.

4671
02:14:38,090 --> 02:14:39,810
Got To have something
that no one knows about.

4672
02:14:39,811 --> 02:14:41,370
He's got to have special prototype stuff.

4673
02:14:41,490 --> 02:14:43,800
Says phones and computers
that we haven't seen yet.

4674
02:14:44,010 --> 02:14:44,191
Yeah.

4675
02:14:44,191 --> 02:14:45,390
With no chem trails.

4676
02:14:45,420 --> 02:14:46,920
It doesn't even make chem trails.

4677
02:14:49,080 --> 02:14:49,980
Oh my God.

4678
02:14:50,460 --> 02:14:51,001
Kim Trail.

4679
02:14:51,001 --> 02:14:51,840
Black helicopters.

4680
02:14:52,010 --> 02:14:52,230
All right,

4681
02:14:52,230 --> 02:14:53,630
we've got to get the
fuck out of here folks.

4682
02:14:53,910 --> 02:14:54,421
That's it.

4683
02:14:54,421 --> 02:14:55,254
