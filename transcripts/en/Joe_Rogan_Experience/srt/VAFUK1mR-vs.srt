1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:00,540
Oh

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:07,280
yes,
we live Tommy buttons.

3
00:00:07,281 --> 00:00:08,450
Let's do it.
Dude.

4
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:09,710
Did you,
um,

5
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:11,960
did you go to the comedy store at all 
yesterday?

6
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:12,990
Yesterday?
No,

7
00:00:12,991 --> 00:00:16,010
I'm going tonight is heavy,
heavy,

8
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:17,250
heavy.
Yeah.

9
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:21,470
I imagine it would have it the day after
Mitzi died.

10
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:26,590
The clothes,
the comedy store down on Wednesday and 

11
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:26,590
yesterday was the first day it was open.
It was heavy.

12
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:27,590
Imagine this the first time it's been 
closed in a law.

13
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:32,640
Like they never close.
I can't remember the last time it was 

14
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:32,640
closed.
It was heavy.

15
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,810
You could just feel it in the air.
Oh yeah.

16
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:39,870
Yeah.
I felt it was everybody talking about 

17
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:39,870
it,
but it was bombing to really.

18
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:43,360
Not on my show wasn't too bad,
but the o man,

19
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:47,150
it was thick.
Know boy is in the air,

20
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,130
you know,
that's real sadness.

21
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,550
Oh yeah.
Paul was.

22
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,580
I've never seen he cry.
He was there.

23
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:55,460
Yeah.
He was crying in the onstage.

24
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:57,040
No,
he didn't go on stage.

25
00:00:57,041 --> 00:00:58,160
She's not going to go on stage for a 
while.

26
00:00:58,161 --> 00:01:00,710
I wouldn't have gone onstage if I wasn't
getting ready for the special.

27
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:02,270
I would have definitely taken the night 
off.

28
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:03,350
Yeah,
if I could have,

29
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:04,430
you know,
if it wasn't early,

30
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,770
if people aren't,
are going to see it,

31
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:11,570
it just felt I didn't feel silly,
you know what I mean?

32
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,970
I like to feel silly,
feel loose,

33
00:01:13,971 --> 00:01:15,560
loose in a good mood,
happy.

34
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:18,230
Everybody felt vulnerable.
Everybody felt,

35
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:20,090
you know,
I mean,

36
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:26,100
I don't know all the people in the world
that are not comedians.

37
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:30,860
She's into the number one most important
figure in all of comedy.

38
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:35,450
That wasn't a comedian.
And then even when you say the ones that

39
00:01:35,451 --> 00:01:36,890
were comedians,
damn,

40
00:01:36,891 --> 00:01:40,160
she's in the running for number one.
Even with the comedians.

41
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:40,640
I know

42
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:42,690
she shaped so many,
you know,

43
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:45,750
she built that whole,
that place and,

44
00:01:45,751 --> 00:01:47,100
and,
and she,

45
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:47,940
she,
you know,

46
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:52,941
they call her godmother,
but it really was like that because she 

47
00:01:52,941 --> 00:01:54,480
advised so many people.
And actually here's the thing,

48
00:01:54,481 --> 00:01:59,481
a lot of people have advice for you,
but she was giving good advice to 

49
00:01:59,481 --> 00:01:59,940
people.
I mean,

50
00:01:59,941 --> 00:02:02,190
look how many people hire.
Hold her in that regard.

51
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,240
Yeah.
You know,

52
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:06,030
legendary people are like,
she's it man.

53
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:07,290
Universally.
Yeah.

54
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:08,370
Yeah.
There's no one going.

55
00:02:08,371 --> 00:02:09,690
Mitzi shore ain't shit.
No,

56
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,640
nobody says that unless you didn't pass 
you.

57
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:12,880
Yeah.
Like me,

58
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:16,980
I met her once and she was like,
no thanks.

59
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:20,880
But what year was this?
2,000.

60
00:02:20,881 --> 00:02:22,590
Six or seven.
Oh yeah,

61
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,520
I remember.
Well,

62
00:02:23,521 --> 00:02:24,810
here's the thing,
when I met her,

63
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:27,040
she was um,
she was already like,

64
00:02:27,041 --> 00:02:29,100
it was at the end of when she would be 
at the store.

65
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,290
She was,
she was not 100 percent doing well.

66
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:33,870
No,
she was rough around then when you would

67
00:02:33,871 --> 00:02:35,460
see her,
she'd be shaking.

68
00:02:35,461 --> 00:02:36,390
It would be very hard.

69
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:37,520
Yeah.
I just,

70
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,520
you know,
when someone's gone,

71
00:02:40,521 --> 00:02:43,340
you stop and think about those times 
when you were around them.

72
00:02:43,341 --> 00:02:48,341
You just like,
I wish I took it in and realize more 

73
00:02:48,341 --> 00:02:49,220
that she wasn't.
She wasn't going to be there one day,

74
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:51,500
you know?
Did you guys have a good relationship?

75
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:52,940
Yeah,
we did.

76
00:02:52,941 --> 00:02:57,941
I mean,
up until the seven years that I wasn't 

77
00:02:57,941 --> 00:02:57,941
there.
And even then it was never her fault.

78
00:02:57,941 --> 00:03:01,120
I called her the date.
That whole Mensa thing broke out.

79
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:06,630
I called her up and told her everything.
I told her the guy's been stealing 

80
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:10,201
material and the whole deal.
And every comedian feels so 

81
00:03:10,201 --> 00:03:13,801
uncomfortable working around them that 
they flashed a light whenever he's in 

82
00:03:13,801 --> 00:03:13,801
the room so that no one does their 
material.

83
00:03:13,801 --> 00:03:15,490
And you just start working the crowd.
I go,

84
00:03:15,491 --> 00:03:17,860
it's a fucking war zone there.
It's terrible.

85
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:20,680
And her exact words.

86
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,950
Well,
while Jess Day away from,

87
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:27,960
um,
what time you want to go up tonight 

88
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:27,960
knows it.
Yeah.

89
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:27,960
And I,
I said,

90
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,340
and whenever you want to put me up,
she gave me a spot.

91
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,580
And then the comedy store called me an 
hour,

92
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:34,030
two hours later,
whatever it was.

93
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,270
Instead I was banned.
And that's how I go.

94
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:39,370
What the fuck are you talking about?
I just got off the phone with Mitzi.

95
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,230
She gave me a 10:00
spot.

96
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:42,250
They're like,
well,

97
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,710
Muzzi wasn't aware of everything that 
was happening.

98
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:46,720
I got the fuck she wasn't.
I told her,

99
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,580
I told her everything.
I go,

100
00:03:48,581 --> 00:03:50,260
who's running the store now?
You,

101
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:52,720
you run running the store and the fuck 
Outta here.

102
00:03:52,721 --> 00:03:56,320
I'm not working for you.
And you guys are going to ban me because

103
00:03:56,321 --> 00:03:59,860
I added a joke.
Thief like this is you guys sell art.

104
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:03,160
You gotta a thief of art that's in your 
midst.

105
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:05,770
You did you understand that?
What a big deal that is,

106
00:04:05,771 --> 00:04:10,771
someone is making millions of dollars of
stealing other people's ideas and you 

107
00:04:10,771 --> 00:04:11,830
guys are just going to let it go because
he sells tickets.

108
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:16,140
The Fuck Outta here,
but my cora was never with her.

109
00:04:16,141 --> 00:04:21,141
I was with the other guys.
Did you guys speak after that happened 

110
00:04:21,141 --> 00:04:21,141
to?
He never spoke to her again.

111
00:04:21,141 --> 00:04:22,540
Wow.
Wow.

112
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:24,040
I said,
yeah,

113
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:28,450
well by the time I came back she was 
real rough,

114
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:29,860
real rough.
You know,

115
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:31,870
she had other things to worry about.
Of course.

116
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:35,260
I just had one.
I had that one showcase.

117
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:40,290
Those.
My only direct experience with her when 

118
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:41,080
I met her in 1994.
She gave me a lot of good advice.

119
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:42,730
She did.
She.

120
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:46,300
She always gave me good spots,
like hard fucking spots,

121
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:51,660
always after dice after Martin Lawrence 
after if anybody would crush,

122
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:54,670
I'd gone after him after Chris Rock,
after this guy,

123
00:04:54,671 --> 00:04:57,390
after that guy anyway that would crush 
she.

124
00:04:57,450 --> 00:04:58,860
She liked you.
She would give you the.

125
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:03,940
The deaths spots really well,
which you realized that you have to.

126
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,010
You gotta eat shit,
man.

127
00:05:06,011 --> 00:05:07,840
You got to develop.
You can't just have.

128
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:13,040
It's like there's an analogy with 
fighting like you can't just fight 

129
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,050
people that you could beat the shit out 
of.

130
00:05:14,051 --> 00:05:15,670
You have to fight people that are going 
to test you.

131
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:20,730
Sure,
because otherwise you're going to 

132
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:22,070
develop like a,
an unrealistic sense of your abilities 

133
00:05:22,451 --> 00:05:26,800
and an unrealistic sense of other 
people's abilities and you have to.

134
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:29,530
You have to.
You have to feel what it's like.

135
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:34,800
I think as an up and comic comic,
like you start thinking you're pretty 

136
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,350
good and then you have to see someone 
who's really good and then you go,

137
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:36,490
oh my God,
I'm terrible.

138
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:41,510
Yeah,
and then you go on after them and that 

139
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:43,111
feeling of just total ineptitude or you 
just feel so shitty and clunky and 

140
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:47,260
awful.
You have to feel that too.

141
00:05:47,261 --> 00:05:49,420
Just it's.
That's the number one motive,

142
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:52,440
like bombing is one of the best things 
that can happen to a comedian.

143
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:55,300
That feeling of following someone great 
is basically.

144
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:57,290
It almost feels like shame,

145
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:59,340
shame,
shame.

146
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,500
Like someone goes,
Hey,

147
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:03,590
do you want to feel humiliated?
Like it's fucking shame,

148
00:06:03,591 --> 00:06:04,360
man.
Yeah,

149
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:09,610
I see it all the time too.
I watched it the other day at the 

150
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:09,610
Improv.
I watched somebody bomb.

151
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:14,980
They went on after somebody's crushed 
and they just would just choking like 

152
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:15,470
right away and you just go,
woof.

153
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:16,990
You got to reexamine.
Yeah,

154
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:19,460
but it's a gift.
It really is.

155
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:24,490
It helps you in those moments are gifts.
Those moments of failure are gifts.

156
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:30,040
They just feel like shit at the time,
but you got to realize that that like 

157
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:33,860
every like leap that I've made in my act
in or in my,

158
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:34,400
you know,
my,

159
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:37,610
my career as a comedian has come from a 
humiliation,

160
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,430
like you hit that humiliation,
they go fuck.

161
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:43,880
Then he come back strong in that.
That's what everything else to totally.

162
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:47,120
Because as long as you actually think 
about it and try to address it.

163
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,440
Yeah,
because it is a,

164
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:51,920
it's devastating.
It's only not helpful if you go,

165
00:06:51,921 --> 00:06:56,921
well,
I'm just not going to even put any 

166
00:06:56,921 --> 00:06:57,950
thought into that experience at all guys
do do that.

167
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:59,960
Of course they did lock it out,
block it out,

168
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:04,961
block everything out,
and they never go anywhere and they're 

169
00:07:04,961 --> 00:07:04,961
still doing the same 15.
Yeah.

170
00:07:04,961 --> 00:07:07,130
Yeah.
It's a defense mechanism.

171
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:12,300
You get just get scared and you can sort
of just autopilot your way through some 

172
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:18,440
half ass bullshit.
Meanwhile you're about to go.

173
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:21,110
Do you have a weak man one week from 
today,

174
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,880
son?
I'm ready.

175
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:26,570
I'm excited that I'm doing it in a cycle
around when you're doing it,

176
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:31,640
you know,
like you just did yours and then you 

177
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:31,640
know,
there's a couple other guys.

178
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,310
Joe Is getting ready to do one.
Everybody's Kinda getting ready to.

179
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,990
Joey lined up for one.
She always got something cooking.

180
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:41,020
We're trying to figure out what's 
happened and either he's going to do 

181
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:41,750
something with Netflix or I'm going to 
direct it and then if,

182
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:44,000
if Netflix doesn't do anything with 
them,

183
00:07:44,001 --> 00:07:46,430
I'm just going to find out something and
that's enough.

184
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:49,490
Just we're going to take over the ice 
house for three days.

185
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:52,580
That's just fucking go bananas.
Just let him go.

186
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:54,530
He's on fire right now.
Yeah.

187
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:58,300
He lost a ton of weight now.
I haven't seen him and I'm like,

188
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:00,770
I don't know,
a month ago or so last night I was like,

189
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:02,570
Holy Shit Dude.
He's like,

190
00:08:02,571 --> 00:08:04,480
I'm down 30 pounds.
So when Shit,

191
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:07,280
you could tell he's.
It's weightwatchers taking my vitamins.

192
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:08,600
Counting points.
Yeah.

193
00:08:08,601 --> 00:08:10,880
Those eggs.
Zero points for Exxon.

194
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:12,410
He only eats the yoke.

195
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:16,850
He cuts.
So you see them cut the egg white out.

196
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:17,540
You're like,
oh yeah,

197
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,280
egg whites.
He's like,

198
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:20,570
throws it off the plate.
He's like,

199
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:22,410
yolks.
Wait,

200
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:23,750
everybody eats the egg.
White was like,

201
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:27,530
that's for pussies jokes.
They don't do that anymore.

202
00:08:27,531 --> 00:08:30,290
You know that egg white thing is 
bullshit.

203
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,510
They realized that most of the protein 
and.

204
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,700
Well,
the whole idea was about.

205
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:38,360
It's just,
it's hard to shake off old ideas when it

206
00:08:38,361 --> 00:08:43,361
comes to nutrition and the old idea was 
that dietary cholesterol is bad for you,

207
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:47,690
but it's not right.
Dietary cholesterol is actually good for

208
00:08:47,691 --> 00:08:49,500
you.
It sounds crazy to hear it.

209
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:50,540
And also,
by the way,

210
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:52,360
I mean,
I know this sounds like a real simpleton

211
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:57,400
thing to say,
but how do they get this shit wrong for 

212
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:57,400
so long?

213
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:57,400
You know?
Good.

214
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:01,910
It's a good question.
All we here for years and years is this 

215
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:06,020
is doctors are telling you to do this 
and then it feels like one day like,

216
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:07,680
oh,
we got all that shit wrong.

217
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:12,900
What?
You can use someone like Chris crusher 

218
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,670
or Dr Rhonda Patrick,
or like Robb Wolf,

219
00:09:14,671 --> 00:09:19,671
like real nutrition experts that really 
understand the way nutrients like the 

220
00:09:21,901 --> 00:09:25,320
way your body absorbs them and what's 
what's necessary,

221
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:30,360
what's not necessary.
What they're finding out is that first 

222
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:30,360
of all,
there was,

223
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:34,950
you know about the whole thing where the
sugar industry paid off scientist to say

224
00:09:34,951 --> 00:09:37,050
that saturated fat was the cause of 
heart disease.

225
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,250
No,
he didn't know about that.

226
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:39,540
Oh my God.
I was in the New York Times.

227
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:41,280
It was crazy.
In 19 fifties.

228
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:47,060
Sugar Industry paid off scientists to 
take the blame away from sugar and put 

229
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:51,921
it on saturated fat.
I know the sugar lobby is insanity and 

230
00:09:51,921 --> 00:09:54,420
that that's the only thing we haven't 
seen on the percentages of,

231
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:57,930
of daily value is the percentage of that
sugar you're supposed to have.

232
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:58,650
Yeah.
In other words,

233
00:09:58,651 --> 00:10:00,690
when you see like,
you know,

234
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,240
presenting.
Yeah.

235
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,140
And then what percentage of and then 
sugar,

236
00:10:04,141 --> 00:10:06,640
it'll be like 52 grams percentage 
nonexistent.

237
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:11,890
So yeah,
they fucked everybody up because they 

238
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:13,590
got everybody thinking that it was 
saturated fat.

239
00:10:13,591 --> 00:10:17,010
That was a problem.
And it's really a refined carbohydrates,

240
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:18,750
bread,
pasta.

241
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:21,060
Your body converts that into sugar and 
then sugar itself.

242
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,530
So there was that,
there was,

243
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:23,850
you know that.
And then there's also,

244
00:10:23,851 --> 00:10:28,440
there's a reality of refined 
carbohydrates mixed with saturated fat.

245
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,290
It's not a good combination.
When you mix the two of them together,

246
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:34,530
it is not good for you.
Especially for some people,

247
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,320
you know,
different people's body bodies absorb it

248
00:10:37,321 --> 00:10:40,770
differently.
But when you're on a high fat,

249
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:43,350
low carb diet,
it's very important that you,

250
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:45,720
that's how you do it.
You can cut that out.

251
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:50,760
You don't want to go high fat and 
refined carbohydrates and sugars as 

252
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:50,940
well.

253
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:53,660
It's not good for you.
And that that is like a.

254
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:57,300
So there's a mechanism to it that Dr 
Rhonda Patrick explained.

255
00:10:57,301 --> 00:10:59,700
But essentially it's just terrible for 
you.

256
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:00,740
Yeah.
If I have,

257
00:11:00,741 --> 00:11:05,250
I have high fat and if I go one week 
just not even go crazy.

258
00:11:05,251 --> 00:11:06,150
But just like,
yeah,

259
00:11:06,151 --> 00:11:11,151
I'll have bread with this and like that,
like in three days I'll weigh eight 

260
00:11:11,151 --> 00:11:13,110
pounds more.
It's crazy and I just go,

261
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:18,190
I can't do that.
It's crazy how the weight just piles on 

262
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:18,190
you.
Yeah.

263
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:21,760
It's bananas.
Speaking to wait bird specialist also 

264
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:21,760
coming out.
Speaking a way.

265
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:21,760
Yeah,
it's coming out.

266
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,950
I think.
What does it have to do with weight?

267
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:25,090
I was just saying births fast.
I was just kidding.

268
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:28,330
I was just associating words,
attitude that.

269
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:31,650
But I think it's considered a Hashtag.
Hashtag Bert is enormous.

270
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,050
Uh,
it's great.

271
00:11:34,051 --> 00:11:35,970
I love that.
He's also shirtless in this one.

272
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:40,430
He took his shirt off and special.
Well,

273
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,250
at least you'd be able to see the 
background being different.

274
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:46,320
It's true.
He's so crazy.

275
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:46,980
Um,
but yeah,

276
00:11:46,981 --> 00:11:49,020
that was coming out.
Netflix this summer I think.

277
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:51,720
Does he just always take your shirt off 
now?

278
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:53,070
I don't know.
I think on,

279
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:54,190
I think when it's a big,

280
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:56,380
like a.
If he's doing his weekend,

281
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:57,490
it's big shows.
Yes.

282
00:11:57,970 --> 00:11:59,530
What is that?
I think he's doing spots.

283
00:11:59,531 --> 00:12:00,770
He doesn't necessarily do it.
What is it,

284
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:04,580
Jamie?
Just put up the pool.

285
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:06,040
What is wrong with your microphone?
Yeah.

286
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:08,660
Fix that son.
He uh oh.

287
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:12,350
Oh my goodness.
He's swimming.

288
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,550
Yeah.
Okay.

289
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:15,590
We're watching them swim.
Why are you showing us this champion?

290
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:20,090
Just to fuck is wrong with you.
Jamie just follows everything burt does.

291
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:20,660
He does?
Yeah.

292
00:12:20,661 --> 00:12:22,040
He's a disciple.
He's a machinist.

293
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:22,730
He's.
Oh,

294
00:12:22,731 --> 00:12:24,290
that's a.
They called them that.

295
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:26,900
Fix your mic pro.
You're a.

296
00:12:26,901 --> 00:12:29,110
you're an audio engineer.
Fix your mic.

297
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:35,030
That was fucked up yesterday too.
You might need a new mic.

298
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,560
I got some backup links I can drive 
over.

299
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:44,650
Yeah.
I mean your mom's house right down the 

300
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:44,650
street.
Right down the street about now.

301
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:45,260
Try it.
Nothing.

302
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,450
I don't hear God damn nothing.

303
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:48,220
Oh.
Hey.

304
00:12:48,221 --> 00:12:49,370
There's still a little crackly.
No.

305
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:51,710
Yeah,
I think it's actually a fader.

306
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:53,390
Yeah,
there's something wrong with that.

307
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:55,960
Oh Shit.
Jesus.

308
00:12:55,961 --> 00:12:59,270
The problems.
So we were talking before the show about

309
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:04,660
you doing a whole new hour now.
How long did it take you to concoct a 

310
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:05,150
whole new hour?
Well,

311
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:07,460
I mean it's definitely still building,
you know,

312
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:08,990
it's new,
it's new.

313
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:09,650
And I,
and I know,

314
00:13:09,651 --> 00:13:12,740
I'm like,
I know it's 15 away from being something

315
00:13:12,741 --> 00:13:13,550
where I'm like,
oh,

316
00:13:13,551 --> 00:13:15,210
this is a solid,
you know,

317
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:16,730
70 minute show,
which is what,

318
00:13:16,731 --> 00:13:20,450
how I liked to do a theater,
so it's going to be months still,

319
00:13:20,451 --> 00:13:25,451
but it's,
I did an hour at the tabernacle last 

320
00:13:25,451 --> 00:13:25,451
week of,
of uh,

321
00:13:25,451 --> 00:13:29,890
it's all new and I did 10 that I didn't,
that I did before that I didn't put it 

322
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:30,520
in my special.
So it's like,

323
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:32,450
that's mine to manipulate.

324
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:33,760
Nice.
I mean,

325
00:13:33,761 --> 00:13:38,761
it was,
I've been working on it for I guess 

326
00:13:38,761 --> 00:13:38,761
since December.
No,

327
00:13:38,761 --> 00:13:38,761
you know,
like,

328
00:13:38,761 --> 00:13:39,770
around then December,
January.

329
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:41,240
Yeah.
So four months,

330
00:13:41,241 --> 00:13:42,720
five months.
Um,

331
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:44,230
it was a blast.
That was one of the most.

332
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:48,320
It was so much fun because I had so much
anxiety going into it.

333
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:53,370
Oh yeah.
Because it was the first big show of 

334
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:56,231
new.
I've been doing some club weekends and 

335
00:13:56,231 --> 00:13:56,231
you know,
clubs are just different.

336
00:13:56,231 --> 00:13:57,260
They're just different and you can get 
away with more,

337
00:13:57,410 --> 00:14:00,800
you can get away with more and you're 
more exposed in a big room.

338
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,930
Oh yeah.
So I was like,

339
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:04,400
I mean,
the night before I was like,

340
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:08,540
what if none of this works like that,
that kind of feeling,

341
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:09,650
or I was like,
what am I doing?

342
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:11,810
And uh,
you know,

343
00:14:11,811 --> 00:14:14,030
I woke up early that morning and I was 
just like,

344
00:14:14,031 --> 00:14:14,860
Nah,
it'll be all right now.

345
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:16,580
You got to be fun now.
It's going to be fucking terrible.

346
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:21,690
Like I was going,
I was going back and forth like that on 

347
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:23,330
that show,
but it ended up being just utter chaos.

348
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:24,650
I mean,
they were just,

349
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,510
they were all about it.
So it was really fun.

350
00:14:26,511 --> 00:14:27,740
I mean I just,
it was,

351
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:32,950
it was so much more fun because I had 
that feeling of uncertainty of course.

352
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:37,500
So that's one of the cool things about 
doing a special is that like you,

353
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:43,030
you get so introspective,
you examine every bid with a microscope,

354
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:47,540
you go over it with a fine tooth comb 
for like weeks before you shoot.

355
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:49,760
Yeah.
You start second guessing everything.

356
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,530
And then that week of,
and that,

357
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:54,530
you know,
on the last one I did in Denver,

358
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:59,890
I did a show Wednesday and Thursday I 
did Oakland.

359
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:06,690
And then Friday I came into Denver,
I did a midnight show at the works 

360
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:09,800
downtown and every show is different and
you're like,

361
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:15,370
this is terrible.
But then you know,

362
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:19,590
and then you have those two tapings.
And I think every.

363
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:20,690
This.
I did my,

364
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,130
that was my third,
uh,

365
00:15:22,131 --> 00:15:26,150
I think our one and you know,
I think almost all three.

366
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:28,820
The first taping is over and you're like
this good.

367
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:31,040
That's fine.
We could use it.

368
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:34,300
And then every time.
The second one is just

369
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:35,390
loops.
Yeah.

370
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:37,190
Yeah.
Once you get it into camp,

371
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:40,100
that's why I decided to do for.
That's smart.

372
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,800
Yeah.
Because I feel like you do four and then

373
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:44,660
one of them's going to be like a real 
show.

374
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,860
True.
Yeah.

375
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:47,690
And the thought,
what I've found out,

376
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:50,540
what I've found out though is if I have 
for the first one,

377
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:52,950
turns out to be a real show because 
you're not as.

378
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:55,330
Not as under as much pressure.
Right?

379
00:15:57,850 --> 00:15:59,450
Because if you have to,
you have two barrels,

380
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:02,850
like you get the one done and then you,
you feel like,

381
00:16:02,851 --> 00:16:03,680
oh,
I got it now.

382
00:16:03,681 --> 00:16:05,690
It can be loose for the second one,
but if you have four,

383
00:16:05,691 --> 00:16:06,470
you feel like,
Eh,

384
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:11,620
let's see what happens with this one.
And you could at least that's how San 

385
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:12,780
Francisco was when I did.
Um,

386
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,270
uh,
the fillmore.

387
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:16,820
That's a good spy.
That's great spot.

388
00:16:16,821 --> 00:16:19,660
But it's a high ceiling.
I'm really excited about the Wilbert.

389
00:16:19,661 --> 00:16:20,960
Wilbert is kind of a high ceiling too.
But the,

390
00:16:20,961 --> 00:16:22,280
Wilbur,
I liked the wilburn.

391
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:27,340
Each place has a low ceiling was three 
stacks of people and then like you have 

392
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:30,500
a high ceiling and there's a high 
ceiling and Bong amongst the,

393
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:33,680
a above the front people in the very 
front row.

394
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:38,800
But it's basically the three,
300 seat comedy clubs stacked on top of 

395
00:16:39,051 --> 00:16:40,020
each other.
That's what it's like.

396
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:42,110
Such a great room.
Fucking amazing.

397
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:43,110
I think I'm,
I'm,

398
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:43,930
I'm looking.
I mean,

399
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:44,310
you know,
my,

400
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:49,350
my next one will be a while from now,
but I've already started talking about 

401
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:50,630
with my guy about how I,
you know,

402
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:52,790
even though on the tour I'll do some big
rooms,

403
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:58,100
I go,
I think I want to go to like a 1200 

404
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:58,100
seater that to actually shoot it.
Yeah,

405
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,740
I think those,
those are in my experience as of recent,

406
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:05,300
that thousand to 1500 seat venue is the 
most fun show.

407
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:08,720
It's like where it's big enough where 
there's crazy energy,

408
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:13,930
but it's small enough.
You still kind of connect with the 

409
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:13,930
audience.

410
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:14,060
Well,
sometimes those big shows that are crazy

411
00:17:14,061 --> 00:17:15,890
fun too.
Like I did 6,000

412
00:17:15,891 --> 00:17:17,280
seats in,
in um,

413
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:20,150
Dallas.
Fuck yeah.

414
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:25,450
Me and Tony and Ian were pulling up and 
this is a big fucking traffic jam or 

415
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:25,880
like,
God damn,

416
00:17:25,881 --> 00:17:27,950
we're all these people going.
And then we realized,

417
00:17:27,951 --> 00:17:32,951
Holy Shit,
they're going to the show coming to see 

418
00:17:32,951 --> 00:17:32,951
me.
That's crazy.

419
00:17:32,951 --> 00:17:32,951
It was very bizarre.

420
00:17:32,951 --> 00:17:34,840
Yeah.
That place was hyped up.

421
00:17:34,841 --> 00:17:39,841
That was a lot of fun.
I did this one theater last year and 

422
00:17:39,841 --> 00:17:39,970
that was a 3000 seater.
Which one is Toronto?

423
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:41,320
Oh yeah,
I've done that.

424
00:17:41,321 --> 00:17:42,640
That's great.
That was a great,

425
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,990
great.
Like for like a pretty big size.

426
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:46,540
Great Energy.
She ever do.

427
00:17:46,541 --> 00:17:48,520
Massey Hall?
No,

428
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:49,650
I never did hall.

429
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:54,900
Some of these places you get to work at.
It's like they're like museums.

430
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,910
Yeah.
Well the Tabernacle is.

431
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:58,920
Yeah,
I mean that we're talking about.

432
00:17:58,921 --> 00:18:01,350
I go.
Can you imagine if the Baptist ministers

433
00:18:01,351 --> 00:18:05,070
that used to give sermons heard what I 
was saying on their stage and I like how

434
00:18:05,071 --> 00:18:07,500
upset they are.
Those guys.

435
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:10,290
That's what.
That was a baptist church.

436
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:15,610
Yeah.
I mean it doesn't have an Oregon behind 

437
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:15,610
her,
so they still have.

438
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:15,610
The pipes are still there.
Yeah.

439
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:16,860
Wow.
Over 100 year old church.

440
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:19,140
It's fucking amazing venue.
Yeah,

441
00:18:19,141 --> 00:18:20,610
it really is.
Yeah.

442
00:18:20,611 --> 00:18:23,010
We're super lucky.
We get to work these places.

443
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:26,140
I did the king's theater in Brooklyn 
last weekend I was at.

444
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:28,590
Oh amazing.
That's old,

445
00:18:28,591 --> 00:18:30,780
right?
All this fuck from the 19 hundreds,

446
00:18:30,781 --> 00:18:35,781
early 19 hundreds.
And then it closed down from like 77 to 

447
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:37,920
2005.
And then in 2005 they started renovating

448
00:18:37,921 --> 00:18:38,010
it.

449
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,240
It's a long time,
that close,

450
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:42,060
long time it was just sitting there and 
then they,

451
00:18:42,061 --> 00:18:47,061
they took forever to renovate it and 
then they reopened it in 2015,

452
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:49,590
2010.
They restarted it somewhere.

453
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,270
Oh my God.
Dude.

454
00:18:51,271 --> 00:18:56,271
I'm telling you,
you walk around the place and it's just 

455
00:18:56,271 --> 00:18:57,140
lavish.
How many seats is debt?

456
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,100
$3,000.
Oh my God.

457
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:00,570
It's gorgeous,
man.

458
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:04,360
That's in Brooklyn and it's in Brooklyn.
Brooklyn,

459
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:07,650
Brooklyn.
Well,

460
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:09,300
gorgeous.
Stunning.

461
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:14,190
Like the inside of it is amazing.
Not totally designed for comedy.

462
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:16,860
Yeah.
You know what's normally there were kind

463
00:19:16,861 --> 00:19:18,780
of like,
I dunno bands probably.

464
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:21,000
I'm sure some comedy.
I think,

465
00:19:21,001 --> 00:19:23,520
uh,
think Chris rock did it.

466
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:25,500
I think some people do comedy there,
but it's,

467
00:19:25,501 --> 00:19:30,501
you know,
I think they've only been doing shows 

468
00:19:30,501 --> 00:19:31,680
there since 2015.
So what it says.

469
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:34,090
Hmm.
Yeah.

470
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:36,380
This is their calendar.
Yeah.

471
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:40,020
Yeah.
There's Jamie's boys.

472
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:40,860
How do you say their names?

473
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:45,990
Jesus fucking thing's broken.
This faded.

474
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,250
It sounds better than I did their show 
on there.

475
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:51,690
I did their show a couple of weeks ago.
Amazing.

476
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:54,360
Those guys are hilarious.
Really?

477
00:19:54,361 --> 00:19:55,800
Yeah.
There's so much fun.

478
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:57,930
They are a really good time and they 
have,

479
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,480
they have such good rapport,
like chemistry together.

480
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:02,490
They're a blast.
They're a blast.

481
00:20:02,491 --> 00:20:04,020
Yeah.
And that show is,

482
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:05,970
it's a fun show.
They do like,

483
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:10,971
you know,
they just do commentary on a bunch of 

484
00:20:10,971 --> 00:20:10,971
bullshit,
whatever current events.

485
00:20:10,971 --> 00:20:15,060
Weird shit happening and then they just 
bring a guest on and they're very loose.

486
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:16,620
Very funny guys.
Man.

487
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,480
That's good to hear.
Yeah.

488
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,810
We need more good people.
Yeah.

489
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:22,980
If you go to,
if you go to bk next time,

490
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,020
you should definitely do.
Is that where they do it?

491
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:25,620
Yeah.
Oh,

492
00:20:25,621 --> 00:20:26,180
okay.
Yeah.

493
00:20:26,181 --> 00:20:27,840
Advice offices there in Brooklyn.
Yeah,

494
00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:30,270
five.
I haven't had much time to do anything,

495
00:20:30,271 --> 00:20:30,540
man.

496
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:35,810
Yeah.
Well you're scrambling a little busy 

497
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:35,810
scrambling.
Yeah.

498
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:35,810
No,
it's good.

499
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:36,210
It's good man.
Speaking to current events.

500
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,820
Is the president going to jail?
I'm trying to figure this out.

501
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,220
Is he going to jail?
It seems like.

502
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:44,040
Seems like some serious shit is going 
down.

503
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:46,880
[inaudible] it sure feels like it is,
you know,

504
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,490
when it feels like it's really 
interesting.

505
00:20:48,491 --> 00:20:50,530
It's like a,
it's like you're watching a show.

506
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:52,840
It's a really entertaining show.
Yeah,

507
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:57,930
I mean I don't mind that house of cards 
is in production because this is a good 

508
00:20:57,930 --> 00:20:59,010
show we're watching.
Yeah,

509
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:02,080
I mean it's ramping up whatever,
whatever is going on.

510
00:21:02,081 --> 00:21:07,081
It's like they're building towards an 
event and it seems like they have been 

511
00:21:07,081 --> 00:21:10,921
planning this,
like they're systematically attacking 

512
00:21:10,921 --> 00:21:13,150
different parts of his administration,
getting people to fold,

513
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:18,480
getting people to turn state's evidence,
getting people to to plead guilty and 

514
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:20,560
they're slowly chipping away.

515
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,700
There's no way that the end result could
be like,

516
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,470
eh,
that's it.

517
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:25,240
We're done this.
As far as we got,

518
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,510
it feels like there's definitely a 
shoe's going to drop.

519
00:21:28,511 --> 00:21:29,170
Right?
I mean,

520
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:34,200
the crazy thing is they're going to get 
them for campaign financing because of 

521
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:39,580
his attorney paint off stormy Daniels.
I think the thing that I read,

522
00:21:39,581 --> 00:21:44,581
I could be getting this wrong,
is that it's that pay off within a 

523
00:21:44,581 --> 00:21:44,860
certain number of days of the election,
right?

524
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:49,890
That starts to break a finance law.
I guess because they said that that 

525
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:53,110
payment was within a certain number of 
days of the election.

526
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:58,140
So what it means is that it's affecting 
the election potentially,

527
00:21:58,630 --> 00:21:59,440
is what.
Yeah,

528
00:21:59,441 --> 00:22:01,630
what the accusation could be.
Isn't that interesting?

529
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:06,840
It's like you're paying someone to 
affect opinion and so that's like,

530
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:10,660
it's a campaign finance violation.
Yeah.

531
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,600
It's also amazing that,
I dunno,

532
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:17,640
I mean I guess at the time somebody 
comes to you with that check and you're 

533
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:17,640
like,
sure.

534
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:21,030
But in retrospect,
thinking how much leverage she would've 

535
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:21,030
had done.
If you go back then and,

536
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:23,110
and,
and she gets to say,

537
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,240
you want me to keep this thing silent?
No problem.

538
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:29,020
But you need to up that check.
Bill O'reilly,

539
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:33,050
Bill paid one lady 32 million.
Not.

540
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:35,050
Did he do?
No,

541
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:38,020
that's not a squeezing an ass cheek.
Right?

542
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:40,120
What did he do?
What did he do?

543
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,250
First of all,
how much money does he have?

544
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:43,790
Thirty $2.
Million is like,

545
00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:45,230
just pay it.
Just pay it off.

546
00:22:45,231 --> 00:22:46,300
Just write it off.
Yeah.

547
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,680
What does that.
A years our.

548
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:52,710
They have a lot of fucking settlements.
Roger ailes and seen the bit I'm doing 

549
00:22:52,951 --> 00:22:54,070
on Fox News.
No,

550
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:58,480
it's one of my favorite belly.
Oh,

551
00:22:58,481 --> 00:22:59,890
I love doing this will be in the new 
one.

552
00:22:59,891 --> 00:23:00,480
Yeah,
yeah,

553
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:01,390
yeah,
yeah.

554
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:03,440
No,
I look forward to seeing you there.

555
00:23:03,441 --> 00:23:06,490
So it's such a fascinating little place 
over there.

556
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:09,730
Yeah,
and right now they're what they're doing

557
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:11,230
for the most part.
Not every show,

558
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:16,500
but the show other than Tucker Carlson I
think is one of the few guys over there 

559
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:20,110
that is,
he seems.

560
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,920
He seems the most reasonable.
Really?

561
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:27,160
Yes.
You think he's more reasonable than like

562
00:23:27,161 --> 00:23:28,960
Shepard Smith?
Wow.

563
00:23:28,961 --> 00:23:31,990
I never watched that guy.
Well that guy is saying he has a.

564
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:37,020
he's there,
but he seems to have like a little more 

565
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:37,020
back,
like unbiased.

566
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:41,371
Balanced.
They give you are doing ecstasy with 

567
00:23:41,371 --> 00:23:41,371
Shepard Smith.
He tried to kiss you?

568
00:23:41,371 --> 00:23:41,890
I hope so.
I think I've been losing weight.

569
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,860
Yeah,
but the

570
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:51,340
rest of it.
My point is the rest of this show seems 

571
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:51,890
like state run propaganda.
Here's,

572
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:54,020
and here's the thing.
He also,

573
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:56,660
when it's not a secret,
it's kind of fascinating,

574
00:23:56,661 --> 00:24:01,661
right?
That it's not a secret that he has real 

575
00:24:01,661 --> 00:24:02,990
relationships with multiple on air 
talent.

576
00:24:02,991 --> 00:24:05,780
Like the president is like I'm friends 
with Jeanine Pirro.

577
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:07,760
I'm really good friends with Sean 
Hannity.

578
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,680
I'm really good.
I've watched.

579
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:10,910
Yeah,
everyday.

580
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:16,210
I watched a morning show called Fox and 
friends and as they report things I 

581
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:21,191
tweet out like policy change based on 
this morning show and it's not secret,

582
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:24,770
like if you see the segment and then 
he's like,

583
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:27,080
like there was this aired at 6:30
AM,

584
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:32,110
6:32.
He's like we're going to have to do 

585
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:34,391
something about this shit,
and they just did a segment on it and 

586
00:24:34,391 --> 00:24:37,931
then that also throws his aids and his 
staff a curve balls because there'll be 

587
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,420
not expecting that he's going to bring 
this up,

588
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,850
but he sees it on tv and there and then 
they have to go like,

589
00:24:43,851 --> 00:24:48,851
yeah,
of course we are going to do that 

590
00:24:48,851 --> 00:24:48,851
because keep him from the TV.
Yeah,

591
00:24:48,851 --> 00:24:51,530
it's fucking nuts.
He watches a lot of cable TV.

592
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:56,680
They say watches eight hours a day.
He doesn't like to go to the office 

593
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:56,680
early and that's one of my other 
favorite ones.

594
00:24:56,770 --> 00:25:00,980
Like the like John Kelly has been like,
you've got to get here earlier.

595
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:07,060
That's hilarious.
I said I sit out for a.

596
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:12,180
He was showing up at 11 and that they 
were trying to get them to come at nine 

597
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:13,640
and then I think they settled on 10 or 
something.

598
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:17,540
Yeah.
Just want to get their fucking nine.

599
00:25:17,541 --> 00:25:19,310
That's ridiculous.
Yeah.

600
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:21,400
It's so interesting.
They really.

601
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:26,100
He doesn't get us into a war.
Having him as the president will be very

602
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:27,800
beneficial.
Yeah.

603
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:33,160
Yeah,
because I think that we're going to 

604
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,021
realize how fucking crazy it is to give 
one person so much power based on a 

605
00:25:35,021 --> 00:25:35,920
popularity contest.
It.

606
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:40,310
It does kind of highlight the absurdity 
of not just of him of the presidency.

607
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,720
Right.
Completely absurd.

608
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:46,780
Yeah.
We'd never do it that way today if we 

609
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:49,031
had no government at all,
if we lived in some sort of Bizarro 

610
00:25:49,031 --> 00:25:51,971
universe where a government had never 
been established when decided enough is 

611
00:25:51,971 --> 00:25:51,971
enough.

612
00:25:51,971 --> 00:25:54,380
We can't live with anarchy anymore.
We need to have some sort of a system of

613
00:25:54,381 --> 00:25:56,300
rules,
checks and balances and put an.

614
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,530
We never say,
all right,

615
00:25:57,531 --> 00:26:00,710
let's have a popularity contest.
See One dude,

616
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:05,660
and let's let them get financed by giant
groups of people know.

617
00:26:05,661 --> 00:26:07,340
That shit's all.
It's ridiculous.

618
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:12,640
It's so fucked.
I know this and then it seems like 

619
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,440
everybody agrees that that's fine,
but they never changes.

620
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:20,500
Yeah.
I've been hearing for a decade plus 

621
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:22,130
about campaign finance reform stuff and 
then it's still,

622
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:24,790
you know,
powerful Super Pacs,

623
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:26,130
collect them.
Oh,

624
00:26:26,131 --> 00:26:28,250
we'll just find a loophole and then we 
get them money that way.

625
00:26:28,251 --> 00:26:29,270
I mean,
nothing changes.

626
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:34,660
Well,
the just the amount of money and 

627
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:36,221
influence,
it's all tied in together to try to 

628
00:26:36,221 --> 00:26:38,620
completely shake that off.
You'd have to get people to be 100 

629
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:38,620
percent ethical.
They would have to say,

630
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:38,620
you know what?

631
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:40,490
This is just not the way to run the 
government.

632
00:26:40,491 --> 00:26:42,710
It's not right for the people,
but they're not going to do that.

633
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:44,100
Of course,
too much influence.

634
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:47,760
It just shows you how sneaky and snaky 
the whole thing is,

635
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:53,030
but it's also really interesting too,
because we're going to be forced with 

636
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:54,240
this guy because of all this fucking 
chaos.

637
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:56,670
We're going to be forced to reexamine 
how we do things.

638
00:26:57,180 --> 00:27:02,180
Maybe it'll be a little change for the 
next president with the.

639
00:27:03,010 --> 00:27:08,010
I'm sorry.
The real worry would be that he would 

640
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:08,010
get through eight years.
Then one of his sons would take over.

641
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:10,180
I guess it's not out of the realm of 
possibility.

642
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:15,190
It's not even a little.
I have this theory that I think he 

643
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:18,111
actually in a way will really relish and
enjoy the midterms in November going 

644
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:25,350
Democrat because that totally feeds into
his.

645
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:30,510
They're attacking and like being able to
be like course nothing gets done because

646
00:27:30,511 --> 00:27:35,511
he's fucking concert or an office now 
and I think that he would really 

647
00:27:35,511 --> 00:27:37,140
actually almost enjoy because he loves 
combative,

648
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:41,050
combative relationship.
I think he's actually going to.

649
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:44,520
If it goes that way,
I think he will like really enjoy it.

650
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:50,000
I think so,
but I also think that he likes winning 

651
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:50,000
though.
He does like winning.

652
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,070
Of course he likes winning and it's a 
compulsive.

653
00:27:53,071 --> 00:27:55,930
You can tell that when they'll,
you know oprah,

654
00:27:55,931 --> 00:27:56,820
you're going to run.
She's like,

655
00:27:56,821 --> 00:27:57,180
no.
He's like,

656
00:27:57,181 --> 00:27:58,820
I hope she runs.
Kick her fucking ass.

657
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,460
He can't help himself.
You know?

658
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:03,450
He has that kind of competitive side to 
him.

659
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:04,650
Yeah.
No,

660
00:28:04,651 --> 00:28:09,651
he definitely does.
Well they say they don't want them to 

661
00:28:09,651 --> 00:28:09,970
testify because they know they're going 
to catch him lying there.

662
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:11,150
Like,
you can't do it.

663
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:13,070
Don't worry,
I'm not gonna lie it.

664
00:28:13,170 --> 00:28:15,140
All his lawyers have said like,
a hundred percent,

665
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:16,110
don't do that.
He was like,

666
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:17,070
oh,
I'll think about it.

667
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:19,230
Which means that like,
he,

668
00:28:19,231 --> 00:28:20,100
you know,
because he,

669
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:25,180
he says that a lot with uh,
you can tell them when they have those 

670
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:25,620
off the cuff,
you know,

671
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:27,750
press,
when he lets the press in,

672
00:28:27,930 --> 00:28:28,920
they'll ask him something,
he'll be like,

673
00:28:28,921 --> 00:28:30,810
we'll see what happens.
Which is totally like,

674
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:32,880
I might do it,
I might not,

675
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:35,600
but you know,
that everybody in his size,

676
00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:38,850
like please don't say anything at this 
point.

677
00:28:38,851 --> 00:28:41,010
They might not even be.
They might be like,

678
00:28:41,011 --> 00:28:42,030
go ahead.
Yeah,

679
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:43,170
yeah.
Go ahead.

680
00:28:43,171 --> 00:28:44,630
Tough guy.
Go talk,

681
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:46,080
go talk.
Who knows,

682
00:28:46,081 --> 00:28:47,340
man,
I'll get another job.

683
00:28:47,341 --> 00:28:50,420
How amazing would it be to watch that 
deposition or,

684
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:51,600
or,
you know,

685
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:53,190
uh,
interview.

686
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:56,870
Do you remember when Bill Clinton was 
grilled about Monica Lewinsky?

687
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,440
The word is,
yeah.

688
00:28:58,850 --> 00:28:59,760
Yeah.
It's amazing.

689
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:04,770
And just the term sexual relations,
as I understand it,

690
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:08,590
the way I understand the word,
that's not it.

691
00:29:08,970 --> 00:29:10,680
Yeah.
No,

692
00:29:10,681 --> 00:29:12,520
I mean that was fascinating.
Eight.

693
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:14,850
He's so shameless.
Well,

694
00:29:14,851 --> 00:29:15,870
not just that,
it's just,

695
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:19,170
it seems so strange.
Yeah.

696
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:24,230
Back then in the 19 nineties to be able 
to watch the president in video get 

697
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:27,450
grilled and clearly they wanted to 
release this video to humiliate them.

698
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:28,590
Of course,
you know,

699
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,840
but it was just bizarre.
It's like I've never,

700
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:35,870
we'd never seen anything like this.
You've never seen a sitting president 

701
00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:39,960
like getting grilled by people and 
especially about sex and the shift mode.

702
00:29:39,961 --> 00:29:40,890
Like uh,
you know,

703
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:45,990
we knew him as this.
Obviously you'd see him on the campaign 

704
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:47,170
trail or meeting people.
He's like this super charming,

705
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:48,800
right?
Like personable guy.

706
00:29:48,810 --> 00:29:53,810
Yeah.
Really good at being basically a 

707
00:29:53,810 --> 00:29:53,810
celebrity.

708
00:29:53,810 --> 00:29:53,990
You don't really good at that.
And he's like,

709
00:29:53,991 --> 00:29:56,290
you know,
knows how to be a politician.

710
00:29:56,740 --> 00:30:01,670
But in that deposition,
I mean he switched onto lawyer mode and,

711
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,090
and like,
I'm not here to charm you motherfucker,

712
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:09,100
because he was spin on is what does is 
mean is like,

713
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:11,020
I remember just,
I mean I'm a kid,

714
00:30:11,021 --> 00:30:12,670
I think I was in high school watching 
that and be like,

715
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:16,050
how does anyone struggle with is like,
is this.

716
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:18,910
And I didn't know he was like playing a 
game with them too,

717
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:20,020
you know?
Oh yeah.

718
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:22,500
Well they were playing lawyer games.
Yeah.

719
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:25,690
Total war games.
Trump can't do that.

720
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:28,100
He's not smart enough to do that.
No,

721
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:30,520
he's not a lawyer.
So he's not.

722
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:33,820
I wouldn't say he's not.
I don't think that trump is not smart.

723
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:36,070
I think he's smart.
I've,

724
00:30:36,071 --> 00:30:37,660
I've.
Especially when you listen to interviews

725
00:30:37,661 --> 00:30:40,750
of him from the past,
like he's like,

726
00:30:40,751 --> 00:30:41,910
there's some interviews in the past.

727
00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:43,150
Very articulate.
Yeah.

728
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:45,010
And obviously been very successful in 
business,

729
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:50,250
but I don't think he's an interested in 
expanding his horizons mentally.

730
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:52,120
I don't think he's interested in 
reading.

731
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:57,150
No,
I don't think he also thinks that he 

732
00:30:57,150 --> 00:30:59,101
really 100 percent does the,
did run his business off of instinct 

733
00:30:59,770 --> 00:31:04,770
and,
and like gut and relationships and 

734
00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:07,270
loyalty and stuff that he's promoting.
When they say like,

735
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:09,310
you can't do that here.
He's like trucking,

736
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,440
mark.
I'm the president.

737
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:13,000
Fuck off.
People want it.

738
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:16,090
Do you want to read this briefing?
No,

739
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:18,070
I don't like to be brief.
I don't like to read.

740
00:31:18,071 --> 00:31:19,300
Yeah,
he doesn't like to read.

741
00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:22,180
They say they put the word trump in his 
briefings a bunch of times,

742
00:31:22,181 --> 00:31:24,460
just so that he reads it screwed ahead.
What?

743
00:31:24,461 --> 00:31:26,770
This is about me.
What else about me?

744
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:29,820
Amazing French.
I don't know,

745
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:34,830
man.
It does feel like it's going to star 

746
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:34,830
report.

747
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:34,830
This is what?
Yeah,

748
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:36,590
blood to a star.
Yeah.

749
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:42,080
This will be like Miller's report that 
would be coming out maybe later this 

750
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:42,080
year or something like that.
Is that the equivalent?

751
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,270
I don't know.
Uh,

752
00:31:43,271 --> 00:31:44,250
yeah.
I guess if they get,

753
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:46,900
if they get to a real special council 
report.

754
00:31:46,901 --> 00:31:47,410
Yeah,
sure.

755
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:52,600
The Mueller thing is so strange because 
technically can he fire Mueller?

756
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:56,080
Well that's,
there was a big article about whether or

757
00:31:56,081 --> 00:32:01,081
not.
So the White House said that they 

758
00:32:01,081 --> 00:32:02,350
believe that he does have the power to 
do that.

759
00:32:03,210 --> 00:32:04,600
But.
And you don't know if that's.

760
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:09,660
I mean,
you would think that that means that 

761
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:12,151
they're sent.
He just wants to put that signal out 

762
00:32:12,151 --> 00:32:12,151
there,
like,

763
00:32:12,151 --> 00:32:15,600
I can't do this.
But there was other legal minds that 

764
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:19,261
said that he couldn't do it,
that he would have to get a bra because 

765
00:32:20,231 --> 00:32:22,840
sessions has recused himself from this.
Uh,

766
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:26,230
the deputy attorney general Rod 
Rosenstein is it,

767
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:30,790
and that he would have to get him to do 
it and then they said that,

768
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:32,200
you know,
that he would,

769
00:32:32,410 --> 00:32:36,460
would not do that unless,
I mean Rosenstein said he wouldn't do it

770
00:32:36,461 --> 00:32:40,040
unless a Mueller had done ms.ms
dot

771
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,030
conduct.
Right.

772
00:32:41,031 --> 00:32:41,470
So,
and,

773
00:32:41,471 --> 00:32:43,160
and that if the president tried to get 
him do that,

774
00:32:43,161 --> 00:32:48,161
he would resign,
in which case they would have to get 

775
00:32:48,161 --> 00:32:48,950
another person either appointed to do it
or whoever's below him to do it.

776
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:52,610
So it's a,
it's a really good episode.

777
00:32:56,360 --> 00:33:01,360
I can't remember a time where I felt 
like there was nobody at the wheel more 

778
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,030
than I do now.
Yeah.

779
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:05,920
It does feel like chaos.
Like it's,

780
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:08,960
there's all people that are in 
positions,

781
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:11,150
you know,
there's the secretary of state,

782
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:12,830
there's the chief of staff,
there's all these,

783
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:15,620
there's all these different people that 
are in positions,

784
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:17,160
but it feels like a,
uh,

785
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:22,500
like make believe and you know,
what happens because this happens 

786
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:25,271
everywhere.
We get lost in our experience of it 

787
00:33:25,271 --> 00:33:28,901
because we live here.
I'm really fascinated by how it looks 

788
00:33:28,901 --> 00:33:30,920
outside of have here.
Oh yeah.

789
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:33,770
Am I.
It must really seem like an even crazier

790
00:33:33,771 --> 00:33:34,670
show.
Oh,

791
00:33:34,671 --> 00:33:39,671
it's got to.
And then Mike Pence is holding Bible 

792
00:33:39,671 --> 00:33:41,340
study classes for the first time in 100 
years in the White House lacked.

793
00:33:41,430 --> 00:33:42,320
Yeah.
Really?

794
00:33:42,321 --> 00:33:45,080
And women aren't allowed to read what?
Yes.

795
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:45,800
No,
no.

796
00:33:45,801 --> 00:33:48,260
Women read the Bible there.
This is for real.

797
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:49,910
No women.
The women are not teaching.

798
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:51,950
There's no women teaching these Bible 
study.

799
00:33:51,951 --> 00:33:52,400
No,
he doesn't.

800
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:54,620
He doesn't like dinner with that Mama 
there.

801
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:56,870
No.
No women next to him at dinner.

802
00:33:57,410 --> 00:34:00,380
Mike pence must be an animal.
I'm just trying to keep it together.

803
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:04,340
He just backed up the ball hog and yeah,
just got to keep them away.

804
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:05,960
No dinner with women.
No women.

805
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:11,350
Mike Penn Sponsors Whitehouse Bible 
study led by Anti Lgbtq anti women.

806
00:34:12,111 --> 00:34:14,000
Extremist.
That this is real.

807
00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:18,470
This is what we got to be careful for 
folks.

808
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:23,920
We've got to be careful of this.
This guy could be president and that 

809
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:23,920
ain't no better.
This is.

810
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:27,290
This guy is fucking radical.
Radical.

811
00:34:27,291 --> 00:34:29,110
Fundamentalist Christianity.
Yeah.

812
00:34:30,390 --> 00:34:31,830
Oh boy.
Ooh.

813
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:34,940
Let me see that little bit bigger.
What does it say?

814
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:38,380
Bible Study Group led by Ralph 
Drollinger,

815
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:42,470
an extremist who says Lgbtq people are 
illegitimate.

816
00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:48,010
Secretary of state nominee Mike Pompeo,
attorney general jeff sessions and 

817
00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:52,691
Education Secretary Betsy Devos attended
the weekly sessions in Washington.

818
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:55,370
While trolling ger claims he doesn't 
tell members,

819
00:34:55,371 --> 00:34:58,550
he's advised in the past how to vote.
He notes that he would,

820
00:34:58,890 --> 00:35:02,270
in quotes,
put the blueprint on the engineer's seat

821
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:06,410
on the train.
I don't know what's going on.

822
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:12,250
People look to their faith as a source 
of guidance and inspiration and Lgbtq 

823
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:13,880
people in our family and friends are no 
different.

824
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,890
Drone jurors,
brand of faith,

825
00:35:15,891 --> 00:35:18,950
however,
seeks to drive a wedge between the LG,

826
00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:21,140
that lgbt thing.

827
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:26,650
First of all,
how did trans people get locked in with 

828
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:30,350
queer people or gay people?
Isn't that a different thing?

829
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,170
It is.
I think they're just all marginalized.

830
00:35:33,171 --> 00:35:34,480
Marginalized groups.
Yeah,

831
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:37,710
but they do.
You know there's a to an a plus.

832
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:39,240
Do you know that?
Yes.

833
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:41,340
Now it's a and a plus.
This is like a.

834
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:46,640
This is an abbreviated list,
but if you really want to be completely 

835
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:49,611
not inclusive,
you have to include asexual people as 

836
00:35:49,611 --> 00:35:51,711
well.
They feel marginalized because they're 

837
00:35:51,711 --> 00:35:51,711
not trans than not gay.
They're not straight,

838
00:35:51,711 --> 00:35:52,910
they just not sex weight.
Why cute?

839
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:57,920
Q for Queer Queer,
but why is that as African Gay and 

840
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:57,920
lesbian?
Because it's just Ahmad.

841
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,090
I'm just a weird guy.

842
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:04,500
I don't know.
What is queer?

843
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:06,250
I don't know.
I thought that men,

844
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:10,780
people right now are screaming at us.
Gendered assholes.

845
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:12,030
CISGENDER,
white,

846
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:15,060
white,
privileged assholes.

847
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:18,120
Pretty wealthy to um,
I don't know.

848
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:18,890
Acu.
Why?

849
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:20,130
That is different.
Why?

850
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:22,740
What is queer?
What is the devastating what?

851
00:36:22,770 --> 00:36:25,620
It's good because we're used to be just 
gain gay.

852
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:30,680
Right?
So Google what is the cue and Lgbtq and 

853
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:35,460
then let's get into a.
and a plus is asexual as a plus.

854
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:36,990
By the way.
A huge thanks.

855
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:38,820
I got a huge gift.
Goodie bag.

856
00:36:38,850 --> 00:36:40,660
Can I say thanks to the roots of fight 
guy?

857
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:45,680
Oh,
this is a great soccer going on right 

858
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:45,680
now.
That's crazy.

859
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:45,680
Julio Cesar Chavez shirt.
We didn't even plan that.

860
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:48,480
We did not plan this.
I came home to a bunch of free shit,

861
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:51,000
like the best.
Okay.

862
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:56,450
LGBT G,
L or G L B e t on what is initialism?

863
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:00,690
Initialism.
I never said that word before.

864
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:02,430
That stands for lesbian,
gay,

865
00:37:02,431 --> 00:37:03,480
bisexual,
transgender.

866
00:37:03,481 --> 00:37:08,481
To recognize this inclusion.
A popular variant adds the queue for 

867
00:37:08,481 --> 00:37:11,220
those who identify as queer or are 
questioning their sexual identity.

868
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,720
That makes you like.
I'm not sure.

869
00:37:12,721 --> 00:37:14,910
I'm not sure.
Talking about Andy Dick.

870
00:37:16,290 --> 00:37:17,250
Yeah,
I might be.

871
00:37:17,690 --> 00:37:18,840
It might be.
I might be.

872
00:37:18,841 --> 00:37:20,550
I'm not sure.
Or at least that's an answer.

873
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:22,040
It's fence sitters.
Yeah,

874
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:24,330
I'm here.
I'm there.

875
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:28,070
They should have to fence it and my 
genders,

876
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:29,500
whatever.
Yeah.

877
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:30,930
What is it?
Movement.

878
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:33,420
A fluid gender fluid.
That's my favorite.

879
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,040
You're a girl.
One day a boy.

880
00:37:35,041 --> 00:37:37,580
The next day I had somebody email me 
too.

881
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:40,470
They said at work they said,
you know,

882
00:37:40,530 --> 00:37:44,640
you can pick your gender for emails,
for company emails.

883
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:49,840
So like this person picked a agenda and 
he's like,

884
00:37:50,191 --> 00:37:51,960
I think I'm going to do this.
And I said,

885
00:37:51,961 --> 00:37:53,580
well what if your gender is changing?

886
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:55,260
I think you should send them an email 
every day.

887
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:58,510
So it'd be like today.
Yeah.

888
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:00,090
He's like,
I'm going to try it.

889
00:38:00,091 --> 00:38:01,140
See what happens.
What do they.

890
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:02,660
They can't say shit.
I guess they can't.

891
00:38:02,690 --> 00:38:03,690
No,
you can't say shit all.

892
00:38:03,691 --> 00:38:05,820
You have to just keep a straight face 
today.

893
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,580
Identify as a woman.
You,

894
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:10,290
you literally can do whatever you want.
Definitely.

895
00:38:10,350 --> 00:38:11,640
Yeah.
Which I mean,

896
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:14,130
and then people argue that you should 
have the right to do that,

897
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:17,970
to change whenever you want.
I guess.

898
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:22,710
I mean it's not convenient for everyone,
but I guess you can.

899
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:24,570
Yeah,
I guess you can.

900
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,280
It's not the worst thing in the world.
No.

901
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,520
But when,
when do we call it nonsense?

902
00:38:32,130 --> 00:38:37,130
Yeah.
I guess there would be a limit because 

903
00:38:37,130 --> 00:38:37,130
if you switched it on the hour,
like get the fuck Outta here with that.

904
00:38:37,130 --> 00:38:41,630
Yeah.
Well what if you decide that you like 

905
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:41,630
identify with things that aren't even 
real?

906
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:46,450
Like elves does Elf kin.
It's a good point.

907
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:48,940
I think I would have you just decide 
that I'm in now.

908
00:38:48,970 --> 00:38:50,530
But again,
if somebody came in your office,

909
00:38:50,531 --> 00:38:53,650
especially if they were a valuable 
employee and they were like,

910
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:57,280
I'm an Elf and they had a straight face 
and you're like,

911
00:38:57,281 --> 00:38:59,680
you're a high producer here at the 
company.

912
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:05,260
Okay.
But if someone comes into your office 

913
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:05,260
and they're a woman and they say,
today I'm a man.

914
00:39:05,370 --> 00:39:06,280
Yeah,
today.

915
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:11,520
Yes.
And I reserved the right to be a woman 

916
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:11,520
back again tomorrow.
Okay.

917
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:11,950
Yeah.
Do you have a penis?

918
00:39:12,370 --> 00:39:12,820
No.
No,

919
00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:14,380
just to man,
man.

920
00:39:14,381 --> 00:39:14,680
Today.

921
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:19,240
Okay.
There they,

922
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:23,350
they're letting you decide whether or 
not you can accept nonsense.

923
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,150
That's true.
I mean,

924
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:26,130
here's the thing,
it's,

925
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:32,340
it's spreading though.
It is growing and it's really a matter 

926
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:35,791
of how many people that don't do that 
except that this is a new reality.

927
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:42,740
Well,
and then there's also the thing that we 

928
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:45,271
all know is that some people have an 
extreme desire to be special without 

929
00:39:45,271 --> 00:39:45,271
doing any work whatsoever.
Yeah.

930
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,830
They don't want to have to work to be 
special.

931
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:51,190
They just want to be special.
So if they can just say there's a lot of

932
00:39:51,191 --> 00:39:52,200
them on instagram.
Yes.

933
00:39:52,870 --> 00:39:53,390
Instagram.
Yeah.

934
00:39:53,570 --> 00:39:56,290
If they could just say they're a part of
some marginalized group,

935
00:39:56,860 --> 00:40:01,860
then instantaneously they get more 
respect and this is not taken away from 

936
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:02,380
the people that I think are legitimately
trans.

937
00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:04,830
I think there's definitely people that 
are legitimately transfers.

938
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:06,960
I think those people that are 
legitimate,

939
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:09,910
Lee Trans,
she'd be upset at these gender fluid.

940
00:40:09,911 --> 00:40:12,160
Fucking weird.
I was bouncing back and forth all day.

941
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:17,080
There's a radio lab about that where the
guy decides during the conversation that

942
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:19,510
he's a man and then he's a woman.
Now I switched over.

943
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:20,920
Now I'm Paul,
now I'm betty.

944
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:25,450
I just changed.
How do we address that as 100 percent?

945
00:40:25,451 --> 00:40:27,730
Either you're fucking with me or you're 
mentally ill,

946
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:30,730
right?
You can't say mentally ill when it comes

947
00:40:30,731 --> 00:40:34,120
to gender.
That's the one area where mentally ill,

948
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:36,020
like if it's violence.
Okay.

949
00:40:36,310 --> 00:40:39,910
If it's impulsive things like gambling 
or something along those lines,

950
00:40:40,390 --> 00:40:42,430
all that stuff.
You could say you're mentally ill.

951
00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:45,760
You cannot say you're mentally ill when 
it comes to gender.

952
00:40:45,790 --> 00:40:47,890
Why?
Because we're scared.

953
00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:50,950
We're scared of being called out,
but if somebody is like,

954
00:40:51,010 --> 00:40:53,690
I'm talking right now and they switch 
and this switch gender again,

955
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:57,160
then they switched and they switched the
fourth time in an hour conversation.

956
00:40:57,170 --> 00:41:02,170
We're supposed to just be like,
that's exactly that fucking dude that 

957
00:41:02,170 --> 00:41:03,100
we've been sending each other back and 
forth.

958
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:04,430
Homeboys,
instagram.

959
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,560
What is his name?
Kyle.

960
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:07,180
Done again?
Holy Shit.

961
00:41:07,181 --> 00:41:08,680
Is he funny?
He's so funny.

962
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:10,840
He's.
There's a guy named kyle done again.

963
00:41:10,841 --> 00:41:14,170
He's on instagram and he's doing that 
face swap thing.

964
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:19,810
He takes Caitlyn Jenner's face and Kim 
Kardashians space in all the family.

965
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:24,820
He does all.
He does all their voices on a fake face 

966
00:41:25,021 --> 00:41:26,130
times.
Oh.

967
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:28,560
And then he does.
He'll do trump talking to sessions.

968
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:30,940
He uh,
he's really good.

969
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:34,190
He's a really funny comic.
I've never seen his standup,

970
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:37,850
but my favorite instagram place over 
this play this.

971
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:38,080
So

972
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:44,580
I'm close to my first female orgasm 
isn't quite working.

973
00:41:55,090 --> 00:41:56,360
Oh,
that's good.

974
00:42:00,350 --> 00:42:01,920
You did some shit on there.

975
00:42:05,170 --> 00:42:07,360
You're distracting me.

976
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:18,600
Therapy,

977
00:42:20,370 --> 00:42:20,790
right?

978
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:29,670
I just want checkers head girl.

979
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:33,900
He's got his whole fucking instagram is 
filled with those maps.

980
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:34,660
Yeah,
they're hilarious.

981
00:42:34,661 --> 00:42:36,360
And it's right now it's kind of a 
secret,

982
00:42:36,361 --> 00:42:37,510
like not a lot of people.
No,

983
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:39,870
no.
I could get 44,000

984
00:42:39,871 --> 00:42:44,280
people just change.
That is one of the best instagram pages.

985
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:46,370
I've reposted his videos.
There's.

986
00:42:46,450 --> 00:42:48,580
So what does this one?
Sure.

987
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:50,850
Hey,
here's a problem.

988
00:42:50,910 --> 00:42:52,540
Let's go bro.
Come on Bro.

989
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:55,470
Let's go bro.
I'll knock you out by the style.

990
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:01,590
I'll kick you in the nuts bottles.
Okay.

991
00:43:01,770 --> 00:43:04,840
Looking to the left.
You'd make you could take tape.

992
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:08,330
Tape that I'm going to kiss you on the 
mouth.

993
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:12,420
Kiss you on the map of your throat.
Yeah.

994
00:43:12,430 --> 00:43:13,100
That deal.
Yeah.

995
00:43:13,270 --> 00:43:13,750
Yeah,
yeah.

996
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:16,500
We feel good,
but okay.

997
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:25,030
I mean,
how much time does this dude have?

998
00:43:25,210 --> 00:43:29,740
This is a guy with no kids.
Definitely get down to center.

999
00:43:30,070 --> 00:43:32,050
If I made one of these,
my wife would be like the fuck.

1000
00:43:32,051 --> 00:43:34,050
Are you going?
Oh,

1001
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:34,840
this is what.
Okay.

1002
00:43:34,841 --> 00:43:37,000
You still want the glasses?
This one is just a silly one.

1003
00:43:37,001 --> 00:43:37,510
Okay,
good.

1004
00:43:37,511 --> 00:43:38,680
I love this one.
Watch this one.

1005
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:39,980
So sorry.

1006
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:41,920
Yes ma'am.
Guess what?

1007
00:43:42,150 --> 00:43:47,150
His real mom triggered by chicken.
But chicken.

1008
00:43:48,940 --> 00:43:52,260
That's what you're supposed to guess.
Ma'Am.

1009
00:43:52,410 --> 00:43:55,130
Guess she's on the phone right here.
Bam.

1010
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:59,060
Bam.
Bam.

1011
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:05,500
Triggering.
But guess what?

1012
00:44:07,690 --> 00:44:12,340
Guess what?
Guess what,

1013
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:14,380
Ma'am?
Ma'Am,

1014
00:44:15,390 --> 00:44:17,620
ma'am.
Ma'Am,

1015
00:44:18,130 --> 00:44:22,360
ma'am,
guess why chicken?

1016
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:33,350
He's 40.

1017
00:44:36,710 --> 00:44:41,180
He's a funny dude in New York guy.
Was He an La Guy?

1018
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:43,040
I think he lives in La.
Oh my God.

1019
00:44:43,041 --> 00:44:43,850
He's funny,
man.

1020
00:44:44,030 --> 00:44:46,190
Yeah.
See me live at Largo in La.

1021
00:44:46,191 --> 00:44:47,800
May Fourteenth.
Go see him now.

1022
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:49,130
God.
Holy Shit.

1023
00:44:49,190 --> 00:44:54,190
And just go to his instagram.
You spend your whole day because his 

1024
00:44:54,190 --> 00:44:57,281
instagram is one of the one of the few 
instagrams where literally everything's 

1025
00:44:57,281 --> 00:44:57,281
funny.
Yeah,

1026
00:44:57,281 --> 00:44:58,880
like half of my shit.
I'm most of my shit.

1027
00:44:58,881 --> 00:45:00,230
I'm not trying to be funny.
No,

1028
00:45:00,290 --> 00:45:02,410
that guy's funny on all of them.
It's just a.

1029
00:45:02,510 --> 00:45:04,610
it's a party.
Fucking hilarious man.

1030
00:45:06,230 --> 00:45:08,460
Guess what?
Chicken Butt Horn.

1031
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:09,860
Mothered.
Sleeping.

1032
00:45:10,490 --> 00:45:13,400
Trump impressions of hilarious.
I know him and bite.

1033
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:18,460
That was nuts when him and biden were 
talking shit on twitter about fighting 

1034
00:45:18,460 --> 00:45:18,620
Biden.
Oh,

1035
00:45:18,670 --> 00:45:20,270
Cindy's.
He kick his ass.

1036
00:45:20,271 --> 00:45:22,490
His ass by the trumps like you'd go down
quick,

1037
00:45:23,370 --> 00:45:23,620
quick.

1038
00:45:27,190 --> 00:45:32,190
You ever think there was gonna be a time
in your lifetime where the president of 

1039
00:45:32,190 --> 00:45:34,220
the United States was saying would kick 
someone's ass?

1040
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:35,960
No.
Kick your ass easy,

1041
00:45:36,110 --> 00:45:39,200
easy,
and he doesn't even fight the keys.

1042
00:45:39,290 --> 00:45:42,230
He doesn't even exercise at all.
He said he would run.

1043
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:45,500
He would have run into that Parklin and 
school without a.

1044
00:45:45,501 --> 00:45:46,520
without a gun.
Yeah.

1045
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:48,590
I would have run.
I'll run in there without a course.

1046
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:50,420
I would have.
Would have taken the guy out.

1047
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:55,600
It's nuts.
It's nuts to say that if that was the 

1048
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:55,600
only thing he had said in the last year,
people were like,

1049
00:45:55,600 --> 00:46:00,251
that is fucking a fascinating guy.
It's a fascinating study and watching 

1050
00:46:00,801 --> 00:46:05,801
someone like we,
we have this strange attraction to 

1051
00:46:05,801 --> 00:46:08,120
people that have like powerful 
confidence like that.

1052
00:46:08,510 --> 00:46:11,520
Like we want to watch it play out that 
guy.

1053
00:46:11,570 --> 00:46:16,570
We don't want to watch that guy.
Just play out watches confidence here 

1054
00:46:16,570 --> 00:46:16,570
goes watch,
watch them.

1055
00:46:16,570 --> 00:46:17,810
Well,
a lot of people are really attracted,

1056
00:46:18,140 --> 00:46:22,480
really attracted instinctively,
intuitively to somebody with the WHO,

1057
00:46:22,540 --> 00:46:24,830
you know the balls to say anything.
Oh yeah.

1058
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:27,530
That's a really appealing quality to a 
lot of people.

1059
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:29,030
Yeah,
we've never had one like this though,

1060
00:46:29,031 --> 00:46:30,110
right?
No.

1061
00:46:30,250 --> 00:46:33,200
Well he was fun when he was on the 
contender or whatever the fuck it was.

1062
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:34,670
The apprentice.
Yeah,

1063
00:46:34,730 --> 00:46:35,840
he was fun.
Yeah,

1064
00:46:36,010 --> 00:46:38,540
and like a stern always said that,
you know,

1065
00:46:38,810 --> 00:46:40,820
he's like,
I've had a great guest.

1066
00:46:40,950 --> 00:46:42,170
Yeah,
there's always a great guest.

1067
00:46:42,230 --> 00:46:47,230
It's a funny,
but he cultivated that whole thing his 

1068
00:46:47,230 --> 00:46:47,570
whole life and then all of a sudden you 
become president.

1069
00:46:47,571 --> 00:46:49,310
You're supposed to be a different thing.
He's like,

1070
00:46:49,311 --> 00:46:49,880
no,
no,

1071
00:46:50,310 --> 00:46:50,760
no,
I am.

1072
00:46:50,860 --> 00:46:52,220
It's what I do.
Bang Hoes,

1073
00:46:52,221 --> 00:46:53,720
man.
Did you see me?

1074
00:46:53,721 --> 00:46:58,260
Said that he asked me.
He asked me to check on the pep story.

1075
00:46:58,261 --> 00:47:00,470
Yeah,
because Melania was like,

1076
00:47:00,471 --> 00:47:04,340
serious,
you made him piss on you didn't.

1077
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:09,700
I swear that's not true and I'm going to
get the FBI on the case on the pis 

1078
00:47:09,861 --> 00:47:11,630
tapes.
Get them on the piss tapes.

1079
00:47:11,780 --> 00:47:14,450
That's how confident I am.
That cold call me.

1080
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:16,790
Can you look into that?
Do I have your loyalty?

1081
00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:21,980
Checking those pits tapes on real man.
Crazy man.

1082
00:47:22,070 --> 00:47:24,260
That'd be another thing.
Would be fun to watch other pis tapes.

1083
00:47:24,740 --> 00:47:26,990
He's fun for comedy though.
Tell you what,

1084
00:47:26,991 --> 00:47:27,980
because he's,
he's like,

1085
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:30,370
Eh,
at the same time

1086
00:47:31,150 --> 00:47:36,150
you're seeing this massive political 
correctness backlash where like people 

1087
00:47:36,150 --> 00:47:38,390
are angry at,
at him and they,

1088
00:47:38,410 --> 00:47:41,140
they're like pushing really hard and the
other direction.

1089
00:47:41,141 --> 00:47:44,860
So it's created this very volatile 
social environment.

1090
00:47:44,890 --> 00:47:48,430
You know the,
the Zeit geist yeah.

1091
00:47:49,190 --> 00:47:51,430
Verizon.
It's possible.

1092
00:47:51,431 --> 00:47:54,100
Trump was with hookers peeing on each 
other.

1093
00:47:56,900 --> 00:47:58,410
It's possible.
Well,

1094
00:47:58,650 --> 00:48:00,760
how did he say that in an interview?
Right?

1095
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:05,020
How did he say it though?
I want to hear it like his actual words.

1096
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:08,230
If it's on here,
this is to.

1097
00:48:08,250 --> 00:48:11,050
He says it's possible.
It could it be like,

1098
00:48:11,051 --> 00:48:11,560
I don't know,

1099
00:48:12,730 --> 00:48:17,730
per conversation about how the trump 
team would position this and what they 

1100
00:48:17,730 --> 00:48:22,711
could say about this.
They actually started talking about 

1101
00:48:22,711 --> 00:48:24,880
drafting a press release with us still 
sitting there and the reason that was so

1102
00:48:24,881 --> 00:48:27,730
striking to me is that that's just not 
done.

1103
00:48:28,270 --> 00:48:30,880
That the intelligence community does 
intelligence.

1104
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:36,250
The White House does pr and spin.
You also said you were struck by what?

1105
00:48:36,251 --> 00:48:40,720
They didn't ask very much.
No one to my recollection asked,

1106
00:48:40,990 --> 00:48:44,230
so what?
What's coming next from the Russians?

1107
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:47,620
How might we stop it?
What's the future look like?

1108
00:48:47,830 --> 00:48:52,830
It was all might not come up.
What can we say about what they did and 

1109
00:48:52,830 --> 00:48:56,461
how it affects the election that we just
had call me then asked to meet alone 

1110
00:48:56,461 --> 00:49:00,751
with trump,
but was it a longer than trump's ties to

1111
00:49:02,111 --> 00:49:07,111
Russia,
including allegations of trump's 

1112
00:49:07,111 --> 00:49:07,111
encounters with prostitutes,
Moscow.

1113
00:49:07,111 --> 00:49:09,730
I'm about to meet with a person who 
doesn't know me.

1114
00:49:10,090 --> 00:49:15,090
It's just been elected president of the 
United States by all accounts and from 

1115
00:49:15,641 --> 00:49:20,641
my watching him during the campaign 
could be volatile and I'm about to talk 

1116
00:49:20,711 --> 00:49:25,711
to him about allegations that he was 
involved with prostitutes in Moscow and 

1117
00:49:26,171 --> 00:49:29,230
that the Russians taped it and have 
leverage over him.

1118
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:34,320
Was there any choice there a why?
If this was salacious and this 

1119
00:49:35,261 --> 00:49:38,110
particular part of the dossier?
Unverified.

1120
00:49:38,111 --> 00:49:40,000
Still unverified by the way?
Yes.

1121
00:49:40,690 --> 00:49:42,730
So far as when I got fired,
it was unverified.

1122
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:47,820
Did you tell him that the steele dossier
had been financed by his political 

1123
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:47,820
opponents?
No,

1124
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:52,020
I didn't.
I don't even think I used the term 

1125
00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:52,020
steele dossier.
I just talked about additional material,

1126
00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:56,760
but did he have a right to know that 
that had been financed by his political 

1127
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:57,400
opponents?
That I don't know the answer to,

1128
00:49:57,430 --> 00:50:01,390
that it wasn't necessary for.
My goal was

1129
00:50:01,870 --> 00:50:05,410
okay for us to play to get us to stop a 
second ago.

1130
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:07,090
We can't really play that I the whole 
thing.

1131
00:50:07,091 --> 00:50:08,210
That's what I was.
Yeah.

1132
00:50:08,410 --> 00:50:09,820
At the minute.
Are we gonna get in trouble?

1133
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:12,080
I don't think so.
I don't know.

1134
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:13,380
I'm gonna come down on us.
No,

1135
00:50:13,410 --> 00:50:16,780
I mean it might notice a ABC News owns 
this interview,

1136
00:50:16,781 --> 00:50:17,500
so.
MMM.

1137
00:50:17,980 --> 00:50:18,640
Yeah.
Okay.

1138
00:50:18,641 --> 00:50:20,620
Cut it out then.
Either way.

1139
00:50:20,770 --> 00:50:22,240
Let's take it from here.
There's some APP,

1140
00:50:22,510 --> 00:50:26,500
some he said it's possible.
So people listening,

1141
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:29,030
we just played it.
Jamie's going to edit it out later so we

1142
00:50:29,031 --> 00:50:30,680
don't get in trouble.
We don't get pulled off of Youtube.

1143
00:50:31,010 --> 00:50:31,760
Yeah,
it should be okay.

1144
00:50:31,761 --> 00:50:35,120
But.
But I'm just madness.

1145
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:37,670
The whole thing is just so crazy.
I just,

1146
00:50:38,450 --> 00:50:40,280
I'm glued to my seat.
I can't,

1147
00:50:40,330 --> 00:50:42,380
I,
I can't see where it's going.

1148
00:50:42,381 --> 00:50:43,910
I know,
I know.

1149
00:50:43,911 --> 00:50:44,770
It's why,
uh,

1150
00:50:45,230 --> 00:50:48,440
there's so much coming at every day that
there's,

1151
00:50:48,530 --> 00:50:53,530
you know,
you realize that there's entire 

1152
00:50:53,530 --> 00:50:55,810
entertainment shows now just addressing 
the reality.

1153
00:50:56,090 --> 00:50:59,840
That is our political spectrum now.
Why doesn't he have to take a pee test?

1154
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:01,640
You have to take a peek.
Trump,

1155
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:04,700
you have to take a pee test.
If you work at ups,

1156
00:51:04,980 --> 00:51:07,360
they had to check.
You give me something.

1157
00:51:07,410 --> 00:51:08,480
Yeah.
Interesting.

1158
00:51:08,510 --> 00:51:10,970
I think he's on speed.
You do 100 percent.

1159
00:51:12,340 --> 00:51:14,680
He doesn't sleep.
He doesn't sleep a lot.

1160
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:19,700
There's a lot of energy and there's some
evidence from many different reporters 

1161
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:22,670
that one reporter even named the 
pharmacy where he used to get a speed.

1162
00:51:22,940 --> 00:51:25,730
He was on diet pills that you're only 
supposed to take for a little while.

1163
00:51:25,731 --> 00:51:30,731
He took him for like six years and then 
there was another reporter we talked 

1164
00:51:30,731 --> 00:51:34,790
about recently that was saying that he's
on one of the fence.

1165
00:51:35,570 --> 00:51:38,150
He's won one of those now,
which totally makes sense.

1166
00:51:38,151 --> 00:51:40,490
He is 70 what?
Seventy one?

1167
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:42,810
Seventy one?
Yeah.

1168
00:51:43,190 --> 00:51:44,870
How does he have so much fucking energy?

1169
00:51:45,030 --> 00:51:47,210
Yeah.
That guy has a shit ton of energy.

1170
00:51:47,211 --> 00:51:48,830
I mean,
when he was on the campaign trail,

1171
00:51:48,831 --> 00:51:49,670
he just would go,
go,

1172
00:51:49,671 --> 00:51:53,150
go.
It was like three stops of fucking day,

1173
00:51:53,410 --> 00:51:54,980
you know,
getting on plane land somewhere.

1174
00:51:54,990 --> 00:51:58,490
I do a rally good.
No Problem Eating Kentucky Fried Chicken

1175
00:51:58,860 --> 00:52:02,330
wasn't eating healthy fried chicken.
I know.

1176
00:52:02,540 --> 00:52:04,160
And uh,
yeah man,

1177
00:52:04,161 --> 00:52:09,161
I think he's on speed and it makes me 
want to get on speed pace.

1178
00:52:10,170 --> 00:52:12,260
We want to be more productive.
I mean that's,

1179
00:52:12,290 --> 00:52:14,630
there's so many people I know that are 
on adderall.

1180
00:52:14,660 --> 00:52:15,980
So many.
I've never tried it.

1181
00:52:16,100 --> 00:52:18,170
I never have either.
Jamie gave me some of them scared,

1182
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:20,000
just sitting around.
Do you watch that documentary yet?

1183
00:52:20,030 --> 00:52:25,030
No,
it just talks about how many people are 

1184
00:52:25,030 --> 00:52:25,030
on.
It just is crazy.

1185
00:52:25,030 --> 00:52:26,040
So many all day everyday.
Well,

1186
00:52:26,170 --> 00:52:31,170
um,
my stem cell doctor was telling me that 

1187
00:52:31,170 --> 00:52:33,020
when he was in medical school that the 
people that it was with,

1188
00:52:33,170 --> 00:52:34,080
like all the,
you know,

1189
00:52:34,081 --> 00:52:39,081
the people who's going to school with,
they were all taken adderall and he was 

1190
00:52:39,081 --> 00:52:41,681
like,
I would watch them finish papers and I 

1191
00:52:41,681 --> 00:52:41,681
just couldn't understand where they had 
the energy from.

1192
00:52:41,681 --> 00:52:41,681
And he's like,
dude,

1193
00:52:41,681 --> 00:52:46,451
we're on adderall.
Like this is the way to go and just 

1194
00:52:46,451 --> 00:52:46,451
like,
Holy Shit.

1195
00:52:46,451 --> 00:52:50,740
He's like,
it makes you feel like you have to get 

1196
00:52:50,740 --> 00:52:51,830
on it because all these people are so,
so productive when they're on it.

1197
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:56,920
I've heard comics talk about it to 
comics really don't think I would think 

1198
00:52:56,920 --> 00:53:01,841
you'd be to ramped up.
I think when they said they had like a 

1199
00:53:01,841 --> 00:53:02,690
lot of work to do those jobs and they're
like,

1200
00:53:02,691 --> 00:53:04,640
I gotta get this done and get that done.
Yeah.

1201
00:53:04,910 --> 00:53:08,570
Yeah.
The downsides got to be rough though.

1202
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:10,240
Uh,
I don't.

1203
00:53:10,241 --> 00:53:11,630
Yeah.
I don't know anything about it really.

1204
00:53:11,631 --> 00:53:13,910
I mean I know that it's popular and 
people have been taking it for,

1205
00:53:14,150 --> 00:53:17,750
but I mean like when you come off it,
I'm sure Jamie did you ever.

1206
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:20,870
You did it right?
I did it twice I think,

1207
00:53:20,871 --> 00:53:23,600
but I think I also took two different 
versions of it because there's different

1208
00:53:23,601 --> 00:53:24,680
kinds.
There's not just like,

1209
00:53:24,710 --> 00:53:26,040
was it in a row and now you're taking

1210
00:53:26,060 --> 00:53:27,300
adderall?
Was it to work?

1211
00:53:27,301 --> 00:53:29,580
Or like just recreation had like art 
projects or something.

1212
00:53:29,581 --> 00:53:31,820
I was trying to get done.
Like I really wanted to get it done.

1213
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:36,920
I was also interested to see what it 
would be like because I've never taken 

1214
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:36,920
it and I've heard friends take it.
Some,

1215
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:37,310
some of my friends really just take it 
to drink more,

1216
00:53:37,890 --> 00:53:39,570
most of it because we're not in college 
anymore,

1217
00:53:39,571 --> 00:53:41,130
you know?
But uh,

1218
00:53:41,340 --> 00:53:46,340
yeah.
So the one time I took it I had a day 

1219
00:53:46,340 --> 00:53:46,650
off and it kept me up the whole time,
which is what I thought would happen.

1220
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:49,410
But then the next day I was also,
I was just still up.

1221
00:53:49,411 --> 00:53:51,150
I tried to go to bed,
couldn't go to,

1222
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:53,710
couldn't fall asleep with a,
it's out of your system.

1223
00:53:53,711 --> 00:53:55,440
It's just a little bit to like five 
milligrams,

1224
00:53:55,441 --> 00:53:58,500
maybe 10 of the slow release because 
there's also fast release.

1225
00:53:58,530 --> 00:54:03,530
You can pop the pill and take the salts 
directly in without having a time 

1226
00:54:03,530 --> 00:54:04,410
release.
So there's different variations.

1227
00:54:04,411 --> 00:54:06,240
What about the day after that?
Do you just crash?

1228
00:54:06,241 --> 00:54:07,340
Super.
It was fine.

1229
00:54:07,350 --> 00:54:08,730
I was normal.
I just thought I was.

1230
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:10,230
I was afraid to go to work.
So I was serving.

1231
00:54:10,231 --> 00:54:15,231
I thought I was going to crash while I 
was serving people's tables and drop 

1232
00:54:15,231 --> 00:54:15,231
food everywhere.
I have the day off,

1233
00:54:15,231 --> 00:54:15,231
so.
Yeah.

1234
00:54:15,231 --> 00:54:15,450
Right,
right.

1235
00:54:16,090 --> 00:54:17,460
Hmm.
Oh,

1236
00:54:17,490 --> 00:54:19,410
you remember Robert Schimmel?
Yeah.

1237
00:54:19,470 --> 00:54:21,660
He accidentally took it once.
Accidentally.

1238
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:25,470
He got the.
So not bob shoveled personality.

1239
00:54:25,470 --> 00:54:25,470
They.

1240
00:54:25,570 --> 00:54:26,410
No,
it's not.

1241
00:54:27,310 --> 00:54:28,480
Yeah.
He was like super mellow.

1242
00:54:28,810 --> 00:54:29,950
But uh,
he told me,

1243
00:54:29,951 --> 00:54:34,951
uh,
he accidentally took it and he called 

1244
00:54:34,951 --> 00:54:35,090
his doctor panicking because he had 
serious heart condition.

1245
00:54:35,091 --> 00:54:36,850
Yeah.
And the doctor said,

1246
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:38,320
you're going to be fine.
Just,

1247
00:54:38,321 --> 00:54:40,540
it's just gonna.
It's gonna last for about 12 hours.

1248
00:54:41,260 --> 00:54:41,890
And he goes,
man,

1249
00:54:41,891 --> 00:54:43,540
I got so much shit done.
He goes,

1250
00:54:43,541 --> 00:54:45,940
I just sat in front of my computer and 
organize my notes.

1251
00:54:45,941 --> 00:54:49,540
I got all my act together just makes you
really productive apparently,

1252
00:54:50,350 --> 00:54:55,350
but we're gonna you know,
it's going to change the way people 

1253
00:54:55,420 --> 00:54:58,030
interact.
It's going to change the way he made.

1254
00:54:58,050 --> 00:55:00,000
If more and more people continue to do 
this,

1255
00:55:00,010 --> 00:55:02,870
going to change the way people feel 
about other people,

1256
00:55:02,871 --> 00:55:07,871
they're going to be all jazzed up.
You think he's on some version of that 

1257
00:55:07,871 --> 00:55:07,990
president?
Yes.

1258
00:55:08,260 --> 00:55:10,850
Yes.
I want to try it.

1259
00:55:10,850 --> 00:55:13,210
And I think if these,
if these reporters are correct,

1260
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:18,190
pull up that story about the reporter 
that even listed the Duane Reed pharmacy

1261
00:55:18,191 --> 00:55:23,191
in New York where trump was on the shit 
for six years and then they think that 

1262
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:28,440
trump is on something now and they even 
specified the stuff that he's on.

1263
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:34,600
Hillary was on some shit too.
She's on either in new vigil or pro 

1264
00:55:34,811 --> 00:55:37,210
vigil.
They're both very similar.

1265
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:42,600
Um,
but that's the stuff that they give to 

1266
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:42,600
narcolepsy.
People with narcolepsy.

1267
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:43,510
Really awake.
Yeah.

1268
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:44,830
It's amazing.
It keeps you awake,

1269
00:55:44,831 --> 00:55:46,030
man.
If you have to drive,

1270
00:55:46,060 --> 00:55:47,380
he'd pop on them.
New vigils.

1271
00:55:47,740 --> 00:55:52,740
That's an interesting one because it 
doesn't give you the same sort of 

1272
00:55:52,740 --> 00:55:52,740
speediness I'm really bad at night 
driving.

1273
00:55:52,740 --> 00:55:57,511
I feel tired.
Those lines they started hitting into 

1274
00:55:57,511 --> 00:56:00,720
just to embrace you will,
we'll keep you calm.

1275
00:56:01,070 --> 00:56:02,140
And if you,
if it's warm,

1276
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:04,390
if you're in a cold place,
you know the heat on in the car,

1277
00:56:05,290 --> 00:56:10,290
that's rough.
Cold with heat driving by yourself on 

1278
00:56:10,290 --> 00:56:10,290
the rope.
No good.

1279
00:56:10,290 --> 00:56:11,290
Especially with no lights on the road.

1280
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:14,020
Night,
night,

1281
00:56:14,310 --> 00:56:14,890
night,
night.

1282
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:17,170
Have you ever fallen asleep and woken 
yourself up?

1283
00:56:17,171 --> 00:56:18,550
Changing lanes?
Yes.

1284
00:56:18,580 --> 00:56:19,870
That's terrifying.
Yeah.

1285
00:56:20,310 --> 00:56:25,310
It's not good and secure as it should 
and it scares the shit out of me 

1286
00:56:25,310 --> 00:56:29,200
fighting Jeremy.
I can't find him because he took it off 

1287
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:30,010
the Internet.
He had the boys cleaned it up.

1288
00:56:30,050 --> 00:56:31,550
Why's?
Why that?

1289
00:56:31,980 --> 00:56:34,690
Michael Cohen on that case got a big 
Dick.

1290
00:56:37,030 --> 00:56:39,820
Michael Cohen,
that Guy Hilarious.

1291
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:45,000
All of them in.
It's like where do they go from 

1292
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:45,000
characters,
man?

1293
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:50,000
It was real weird.
Nothing was coming up on Google like it 

1294
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:50,000
really was being taken off really well.
I found it.

1295
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:50,500
Yeah.
Hmm.

1296
00:56:50,630 --> 00:56:51,850
Okay.
Fun Fact.

1297
00:56:52,180 --> 00:56:57,180
Nineteen 82.
Trump started taking amphetamine 

1298
00:56:57,180 --> 00:56:57,180
derivatives.
Abused them.

1299
00:56:57,180 --> 00:56:59,800
Only supposed to take two for 25 days.
Stayed on him for eight years.

1300
00:57:00,490 --> 00:57:01,480
Really?
Wow.

1301
00:57:01,780 --> 00:57:03,520
Right.
Here's the White House.

1302
00:57:03,521 --> 00:57:08,521
Admitted it to me saying only for a 
short time for diet when he was not 

1303
00:57:08,521 --> 00:57:08,521
overweight.

1304
00:57:08,530 --> 00:57:10,990
I countered with medical records.
They cut me off.

1305
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:15,910
People misreading drug was die.
Ethel probe,

1306
00:57:16,490 --> 00:57:21,490
p n d I e t h y l p r o p t I o n 75 
milligrams a day prescription filled at 

1307
00:57:26,411 --> 00:57:31,411
Duane reed on 57th street in Manhattan.
Not that I know things get crazy.

1308
00:57:32,590 --> 00:57:37,590
I'm the doctor wrote the prescription Dr
Joseph Greenberg diagnosed him with 

1309
00:57:37,751 --> 00:57:41,080
metabolic imbalance,
which we have never heard about.

1310
00:57:41,081 --> 00:57:46,081
Again.
Greenberg was later publicly slammed as 

1311
00:57:46,081 --> 00:57:47,560
someone who would provide uppers to rich
people in Manhattan,

1312
00:57:47,830 --> 00:57:52,830
metabolic imbalance,
if true could be an electrolyte 

1313
00:57:52,830 --> 00:57:55,180
insufficiencies,
anaerobic imbalances,

1314
00:57:55,510 --> 00:58:00,510
acid imbalances,
and as sort of an assortment of related 

1315
00:58:00,510 --> 00:58:02,680
disorders that can have serious health 
consequences.

1316
00:58:02,681 --> 00:58:07,200
Yet his other doctor,
Dr Harold Bornstein said,

1317
00:58:07,210 --> 00:58:12,210
been trump's dr since 1988.
Never mentioned the metal bulk and 

1318
00:58:12,210 --> 00:58:14,020
balance found by Greenberg.
So this guy would just like Tommy,

1319
00:58:14,140 --> 00:58:17,490
you've got a medical imbalance or 
metabolic metabolic imbalance.

1320
00:58:17,530 --> 00:58:18,760
What I say here,
take these,

1321
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:19,690
take these.
What are they?

1322
00:58:19,691 --> 00:58:21,520
That's fucking great.
That's what they are.

1323
00:58:22,340 --> 00:58:23,170
How do I take it?
Before,

1324
00:58:23,260 --> 00:58:24,190
I don't know,
eight years,

1325
00:58:24,430 --> 00:58:26,500
but there was another one.
Yeah,

1326
00:58:26,530 --> 00:58:27,820
there's.
That's the amphetamine.

1327
00:58:27,890 --> 00:58:29,740
A drug of phenylalanine.
See,

1328
00:58:29,741 --> 00:58:34,741
this is m,
m fab pra Moan,

1329
00:58:35,050 --> 00:58:40,050
and fet promotes a stimulant of the 
phenol phen phen phen asylum mean 

1330
00:58:46,450 --> 00:58:51,450
amphetamine.
So this is the shit they think he's on 

1331
00:58:51,450 --> 00:58:51,450
now.
Yeah,

1332
00:58:51,450 --> 00:58:51,670
that's what came up when I grew up with 
that.

1333
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:53,920
Yeah,
they think he's on something now.

1334
00:58:54,310 --> 00:58:55,300
I think.
Look man,

1335
00:58:55,330 --> 00:58:57,880
I think this is a not so dirty little 
secret.

1336
00:58:57,910 --> 00:58:59,020
I don't think there's anything wrong 
with it.

1337
00:58:59,050 --> 00:59:00,880
We take coffee.
That's a stimulant.

1338
00:59:00,881 --> 00:59:02,470
Sure.
These people are just taking pills.

1339
00:59:02,890 --> 00:59:03,910
Yeah,
I don't think he does.

1340
00:59:03,911 --> 00:59:05,320
Right.
Isn't he like a not a coffee guy?

1341
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:06,880
No,
I don't think he drinks coffee.

1342
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:08,920
I don't think he drinks booze at all.
No.

1343
00:59:08,950 --> 00:59:09,580
No.
So,

1344
00:59:09,700 --> 00:59:11,800
so he's just in the uppers diet coke 
though,

1345
00:59:11,801 --> 00:59:12,460
right?
Yeah.

1346
00:59:12,630 --> 00:59:15,330
Like 19 dcs.
Press downs.

1347
00:59:15,340 --> 00:59:16,050
Those.
Yeah.

1348
00:59:16,790 --> 00:59:18,710
It's crazy.
That's caffeine,

1349
00:59:18,810 --> 00:59:19,540
right?
You well,

1350
00:59:19,541 --> 00:59:21,220
yeah,
he's definitely into caffeine.

1351
00:59:21,230 --> 00:59:26,230
So he drinks the caffeine all day and 
he's taken these uppers and that's how 

1352
00:59:26,230 --> 00:59:28,500
he gets shit done for America.
That's how it brings coal back.

1353
00:59:28,580 --> 00:59:33,580
Yeah.
It's bringing sexy back to strange mean 

1354
00:59:34,340 --> 00:59:35,390
the,
those pills.

1355
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:38,930
The thing about when you think about 
amphetamines,

1356
00:59:39,020 --> 00:59:44,020
when you think about brash decisions,
think about people that are overly,

1357
00:59:45,290 --> 00:59:47,420
overly confident,
you know,

1358
00:59:47,510 --> 00:59:48,480
arrogant.
Like,

1359
00:59:48,670 --> 00:59:53,670
look,
this is exactly what you expect from 

1360
00:59:53,670 --> 00:59:53,670
him.
Totally.

1361
00:59:53,670 --> 00:59:53,670
Super aggressive.
Yeah.

1362
00:59:53,670 --> 00:59:55,220
It doesn't strike me as a crazy 
conspiracy.

1363
00:59:55,370 --> 00:59:56,690
No.
To say that that's happening.

1364
00:59:56,780 --> 00:59:58,310
It's fascinating.
But now that's my question,

1365
00:59:58,311 --> 01:00:00,600
like why don't they test them?
Yeah.

1366
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:03,230
We found out he's off the charts.

1367
01:00:03,530 --> 01:00:05,480
You get his charts backing like,
whoa.

1368
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:08,420
It's just like cocaine out of control.
He's like,

1369
01:00:08,450 --> 01:00:08,990
yeah,
whatever.

1370
01:00:08,991 --> 01:00:11,320
I do an eight ball a day.
So a ball while here.

1371
01:00:11,321 --> 01:00:13,460
A little there.
What do you think Putin's doing?

1372
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:16,880
Trying to keep the wolves out of our 
door.

1373
01:00:17,570 --> 01:00:22,570
Do you see that video that was going 
around yesterday of the dog that got 

1374
01:00:22,570 --> 01:00:22,940
killed by the two wolves?
Oh No,

1375
01:00:22,970 --> 01:00:24,290
it was horrible.
German shepherd.

1376
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:25,550
Oh,
don't show it please.

1377
01:00:25,610 --> 01:00:30,610
German shepherd.
They dragged it out of the yard and 

1378
01:00:30,610 --> 01:00:30,610
they're killing it in the street on 
security camera.

1379
01:00:30,610 --> 01:00:31,670
We're like,
we're part of the,

1380
01:00:31,730 --> 01:00:33,830
I don't know,
somewhere in a community.

1381
01:00:33,860 --> 01:00:38,110
It's a neighborhood neighborhood though.
I mean it's like a paved street here.

1382
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:40,130
Coyotes at night.
I see them during the day,

1383
01:00:40,131 --> 01:00:43,550
sometimes two running down the street.
One killed my chicken last week.

1384
01:00:43,630 --> 01:00:44,420
Really?
Two weeks ago,

1385
01:00:44,510 --> 01:00:46,010
two weeks ago.
And another one got a chicken.

1386
01:00:46,010 --> 01:00:47,960
Do you feel like you're just gone around
the other day?

1387
01:00:47,961 --> 01:00:51,670
They were on the roof of the chicken.
The Hen house plucking at the pulling of

1388
01:00:51,671 --> 01:00:53,840
the chicken wire,
trying to pull the chicken wire off.

1389
01:00:53,890 --> 01:00:54,950
Ooh.
Yeah.

1390
01:00:55,220 --> 01:00:56,660
Especially if they're do it for the 
roof.

1391
01:00:56,900 --> 01:01:01,900
They do it from the roof.
They're going to fall in and if they 

1392
01:01:01,900 --> 01:01:01,900
fall,
fallen,

1393
01:01:01,900 --> 01:01:01,900
they going to be stuck in the chicken 
coop.

1394
01:01:01,900 --> 01:01:03,680
Just kill them all and yeah,
they'll just kill them all and then I'll

1395
01:01:03,681 --> 01:01:04,630
kill them.
Yeah.

1396
01:01:05,210 --> 01:01:07,220
But that's just fucked.
What would you do?

1397
01:01:07,290 --> 01:01:08,780
Shoot him?
Oh yeah,

1398
01:01:08,930 --> 01:01:10,350
yeah,
yeah.

1399
01:01:10,360 --> 01:01:14,130
I wonder if my neighbors would tell the 
cops if they're heard pop,

1400
01:01:14,360 --> 01:01:14,870
pop,
pop.

1401
01:01:15,030 --> 01:01:19,010
We just hit him with a gun.
That shotgun fucking head checking.

1402
01:01:19,220 --> 01:01:22,190
Uh,
I don't know what I would use.

1403
01:01:22,310 --> 01:01:27,310
It'd be hard to shoot him with a bow 
because I'd have to get them to sit 

1404
01:01:27,310 --> 01:01:27,740
still.

1405
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:32,800
Right.
Well I drew back and then they'd be 

1406
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:34,901
running around the chicken coop.
So I'd be in there with them in the 

1407
01:01:34,901 --> 01:01:34,901
chicken coop.
No.

1408
01:01:34,901 --> 01:01:35,340
Good.
Like what would they do?

1409
01:01:35,341 --> 01:01:36,740
Would they attack me?
Maybe.

1410
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:38,840
Maybe if they're feeling panicked to 
that panic,

1411
01:01:38,940 --> 01:01:43,940
they felt trapped.
It certainly will be running around in 

1412
01:01:43,940 --> 01:01:43,940
circles with whether or not they decide 
to just leap at me,

1413
01:01:43,970 --> 01:01:45,890
bite my face off.
Maybe a rifle.

1414
01:01:46,010 --> 01:01:48,680
That'd be the easiest.
Probably loud as fuck.

1415
01:01:48,681 --> 01:01:49,730
Super loud.
Yeah.

1416
01:01:49,731 --> 01:01:54,731
You,
you have a couple of those going off in 

1417
01:01:54,731 --> 01:01:54,731
the backyard.
People gonna call the cops.

1418
01:01:54,731 --> 01:01:57,880
Oh yeah.
But then would you get in trouble for 

1419
01:01:57,880 --> 01:01:58,430
that?
I don't think you're supposed to shoot a

1420
01:01:58,431 --> 01:01:59,810
gun in your yard,
Tom.

1421
01:01:59,930 --> 01:02:02,840
Yes,
but what if you feel threatened?

1422
01:02:03,050 --> 01:02:04,520
Well,
if you were,

1423
01:02:04,580 --> 01:02:09,580
if someone was breaking into your home 
and threatening your life and you shot 

1424
01:02:09,580 --> 01:02:09,680
them,
that would be one thing.

1425
01:02:09,770 --> 01:02:12,620
Defensive Life and property.
That's not this.

1426
01:02:13,790 --> 01:02:15,830
This is like you have a varmint in your 
backyard.

1427
01:02:16,220 --> 01:02:18,830
I don't think you'd get in trouble for 
killing coyotes.

1428
01:02:19,830 --> 01:02:20,430
Coyotes

1429
01:02:20,490 --> 01:02:25,490
are thought of as like rats as crazy as 
that because we have a hierarchy when it

1430
01:02:25,561 --> 01:02:26,430
comes to animals.
Right?

1431
01:02:26,490 --> 01:02:28,020
Yeah.
I mean we love,

1432
01:02:29,010 --> 01:02:34,010
we love dogs and cats,
but we don't really give a shit about 

1433
01:02:34,010 --> 01:02:34,010
mice.
No.

1434
01:02:34,010 --> 01:02:34,740
Oh No.
Everywhere you go.

1435
01:02:34,741 --> 01:02:36,780
You buy mice traps.
Snap their necks.

1436
01:02:36,781 --> 01:02:38,190
Electrocute them.
Yeah.

1437
01:02:38,790 --> 01:02:39,930
Yeah.
Even glue traps.

1438
01:02:39,931 --> 01:02:42,270
Those are the worst mice.
Get stuck on the glue.

1439
01:02:42,360 --> 01:02:47,360
Put One of those.
I tell you that like 10 years ago I 

1440
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:48,030
lived in silver lake.
I see rats crawling over here.

1441
01:02:48,031 --> 01:02:49,710
Rats.
You see rats all the time.

1442
01:02:50,010 --> 01:02:54,000
I went to this at this office.
I was working part time and they go,

1443
01:02:54,001 --> 01:02:54,780
uh,
the guy was like,

1444
01:02:54,810 --> 01:02:55,950
oh,
just take these,

1445
01:02:55,951 --> 01:02:58,470
uh,
take these rat traps with you,

1446
01:02:58,620 --> 01:03:01,030
like glue traps and they'll get stuck in
it and uh,

1447
01:03:01,420 --> 01:03:02,340
it,
it's perfect.

1448
01:03:02,341 --> 01:03:03,060
That's what you should do.

1449
01:03:03,630 --> 01:03:05,790
So I took it,
put some peanut butter on it,

1450
01:03:05,791 --> 01:03:10,791
like you said,
put it in the backyard and the next day 

1451
01:03:10,791 --> 01:03:13,300
they were flipped over and shit on.
It's like the rat step.

1452
01:03:13,301 --> 01:03:14,640
Then it was like,
fuck this,

1453
01:03:15,030 --> 01:03:17,190
flipped it over and took a shit on it.
Like,

1454
01:03:17,220 --> 01:03:17,970
fuck you,
man.

1455
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:19,590
I was like,
I told him.

1456
01:03:19,591 --> 01:03:20,010
He was like,
oh,

1457
01:03:20,020 --> 01:03:22,410
that's pretty big rat then.
Okay.

1458
01:03:22,830 --> 01:03:27,450
I caught a big one in my backyard,
my garage rather when I lived in Encino,

1459
01:03:28,050 --> 01:03:28,590
uh,
the,

1460
01:03:28,670 --> 01:03:30,330
the,
the trap came down,

1461
01:03:30,331 --> 01:03:31,770
snapped his neck,
killed him.

1462
01:03:31,830 --> 01:03:33,240
I went out there,
he's up fat boy.

1463
01:03:33,241 --> 01:03:34,260
I was like,
Ooh,

1464
01:03:34,290 --> 01:03:36,780
there's a big rat.
I'm like,

1465
01:03:36,781 --> 01:03:39,180
I'll get that in the morning.
I just left it out there.

1466
01:03:39,181 --> 01:03:44,181
I went back in the morning.
It was eating everything except the 

1467
01:03:44,181 --> 01:03:44,181
tail.
They ate him though.

1468
01:03:44,181 --> 01:03:44,400
Yeah,
that makes sense.

1469
01:03:44,970 --> 01:03:45,990
On each other.
Yeah.

1470
01:03:46,470 --> 01:03:47,630
Yeah,
yeah.

1471
01:03:47,640 --> 01:03:52,640
The tear each other up.
Did you see that rats documentary on 

1472
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:52,640
Netflix?
No.

1473
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:54,480
Woo.
Say it should.

1474
01:03:54,540 --> 01:03:56,760
I don't like rats scare you.
Yeah.

1475
01:03:57,050 --> 01:03:58,470
I don't need it in my head.
I don't need it.

1476
01:03:58,770 --> 01:04:00,070
Need it.
Jeremy saw it.

1477
01:04:00,080 --> 01:04:01,920
Right.
It's fucking great.

1478
01:04:02,600 --> 01:04:07,600
Let me just makes you realize the sheer 
volume of them in American cities 

1479
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:07,600
everywhere.
Oh yeah.

1480
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:08,820
It's more rats in New York City than 
there are people.

1481
01:04:08,850 --> 01:04:10,810
They said that they'll get through the,
you know,

1482
01:04:10,890 --> 01:04:15,890
or mice.
At least we'll get through a hole the 

1483
01:04:15,890 --> 01:04:18,250
size of a dime or something like that.
They're flexible and they're.

1484
01:04:18,251 --> 01:04:21,420
They just shove their way in.
They're not like us.

1485
01:04:21,750 --> 01:04:23,220
They're crazy.
They're crazy smart.

1486
01:04:23,221 --> 01:04:27,000
To the older rats,
they'll send younger rats to go check on

1487
01:04:27,001 --> 01:04:32,001
bates and stuff like that.
Or someone leaves behind rat bait that 

1488
01:04:32,001 --> 01:04:32,100
is poisoning.
The old rats will sit back like,

1489
01:04:32,101 --> 01:04:34,200
man,
I don't think so on the young rats,

1490
01:04:34,210 --> 01:04:35,360
like,
move over here.

1491
01:04:35,370 --> 01:04:36,450
Was that food?
Your car,

1492
01:04:36,470 --> 01:04:38,100
your car is not going to eat.
You're not going to eat.

1493
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:39,070
Good man.
Good.

1494
01:04:39,120 --> 01:04:41,910
I eat and then he'll eat and die and 
they'll go,

1495
01:04:41,911 --> 01:04:43,470
yep.
I thought so.

1496
01:04:43,980 --> 01:04:47,080
So because of that,
they've developed poisoned.

1497
01:04:47,100 --> 01:04:49,620
That takes like 10,
11 hours to kick in.

1498
01:04:50,070 --> 01:04:51,640
So one rattle eat it.
He's like,

1499
01:04:51,641 --> 01:04:52,740
how are you feeling?
I'm feeling great,

1500
01:04:53,010 --> 01:04:54,270
I'm fine,
I'm fine.

1501
01:04:54,540 --> 01:04:56,400
And then the other rats will eat it too 
because they're like,

1502
01:04:56,430 --> 01:04:57,180
oh,
he's okay.

1503
01:04:57,780 --> 01:04:59,120
And then yeah.
So they're,

1504
01:04:59,121 --> 01:05:04,121
they're,
they're developing these slow release 

1505
01:05:04,121 --> 01:05:06,261
poisons,
but then you just have this rotting rat 

1506
01:05:06,261 --> 01:05:07,320
like you're not stop.
There's no way you're going to eradicate

1507
01:05:07,321 --> 01:05:08,580
the problem.
Like if someone said,

1508
01:05:08,581 --> 01:05:13,581
hey,
I've got a solution to completely 

1509
01:05:13,581 --> 01:05:13,581
eliminate all the rats were New York 
City,

1510
01:05:13,581 --> 01:05:14,130
like,
no you don't.

1511
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:15,970
Is there no solution?
There's no solution isn't.

1512
01:05:16,100 --> 01:05:21,100
No.
Unless you little robot rats that eat 

1513
01:05:21,100 --> 01:05:21,100
rats.

1514
01:05:21,100 --> 01:05:23,050
Oh right.
All they do is eat rats.

1515
01:05:23,080 --> 01:05:26,950
That's what you'd have to let loose.
He'd have to let loose a scourge.

1516
01:05:27,430 --> 01:05:32,430
Just a pack of robot rat eating rats 
that only eat rats and they can do what 

1517
01:05:33,491 --> 01:05:35,770
rats do there.
That's the one that had a bought flying.

1518
01:05:35,780 --> 01:05:37,840
It's body that was like the size of a 
football.

1519
01:05:38,110 --> 01:05:40,660
What was in his body?
A Bot fly that lava.

1520
01:05:41,290 --> 01:05:43,750
See that whole next to his neck.
That was a.

1521
01:05:43,751 --> 01:05:45,640
There was a parasite in there that was 
that big.

1522
01:05:45,820 --> 01:05:49,030
That's like if you had a soccer ball 
growing out of your chest.

1523
01:05:49,900 --> 01:05:54,900
Yeah,
and the rats dead and that thing is 

1524
01:05:54,900 --> 01:05:54,900
alive still.
Really?

1525
01:05:54,900 --> 01:05:55,120
Yeah.
It's in the dock.

1526
01:05:55,210 --> 01:05:56,960
Yeah,
on the.

1527
01:05:56,961 --> 01:06:01,090
And they were finding all these crazy 
diseases that are just totally fatal,

1528
01:06:01,390 --> 01:06:04,600
just floating around inside the rat's 
body and rats,

1529
01:06:04,780 --> 01:06:07,960
like they're fine,
but it would kill us.

1530
01:06:08,050 --> 01:06:09,280
How's that happened?
Oh,

1531
01:06:09,281 --> 01:06:11,270
there's a foul,
foul little creature.

1532
01:06:11,310 --> 01:06:16,310
So fat.
Why don't we just set like all these 

1533
01:06:16,310 --> 01:06:17,971
sewers on fire that's going to work like
a little kid then?

1534
01:06:18,091 --> 01:06:19,450
Yeah,
it's like a little kid solution.

1535
01:06:20,650 --> 01:06:22,600
Just fucking poor gasoline in the 
sewage,

1536
01:06:22,990 --> 01:06:25,390
but there's certain problems that we 
just don't have an answer to.

1537
01:06:25,420 --> 01:06:29,050
That's the problem of rats in cities.
They don't have an answer to.

1538
01:06:29,530 --> 01:06:33,490
I mean you can mitigate it by 
controlling your trash or this or that.

1539
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:37,690
There's a few things you could do to 
sort of keep them like at least at bay,

1540
01:06:38,200 --> 01:06:40,510
but they're going to be hungry and 
they're going to be searching around and

1541
01:06:40,511 --> 01:06:41,950
people are always going to leave 
garbage.

1542
01:06:41,951 --> 01:06:43,720
There's always going to be food in New 
York,

1543
01:06:44,050 --> 01:06:44,980
in New York City.
Right.

1544
01:06:46,060 --> 01:06:51,060
So much filth.
How many rats do you think are in 

1545
01:06:51,060 --> 01:06:51,060
Manhattan?
Oh,

1546
01:06:51,060 --> 01:06:53,910
let's see how many people.
I think there's $7,000,000.

1547
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:56,620
This is about eight point 6 million pa 
point 6 million people.

1548
01:06:56,830 --> 01:07:01,780
I'd say 13 million rats come.
I'm going to go with 24.

1549
01:07:02,350 --> 01:07:06,970
This estimate says there are 
approximately 33 point $6 million,

1550
01:07:06,971 --> 01:07:09,490
which is as many as five rats per 
person.

1551
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:14,560
So many.
Wow.

1552
01:07:15,160 --> 01:07:16,660
That's.
How do they get that?

1553
01:07:16,661 --> 01:07:18,520
And there's different ones.
Uptown and downtown.

1554
01:07:18,521 --> 01:07:23,521
There's a dip.
Genetically Genetically Distinguishable 

1555
01:07:23,521 --> 01:07:26,431
groups.
How many groups to to genetically 

1556
01:07:26,431 --> 01:07:26,680
distinguishable groups of uptown and 
downtown?

1557
01:07:26,681 --> 01:07:28,480
They have those uppity.
Uptown Rats,

1558
01:07:29,710 --> 01:07:31,850
upper west side,
rat hoes.

1559
01:07:31,870 --> 01:07:36,870
Fucking upper east side.
The lounge in those cool soho rats.

1560
01:07:38,830 --> 01:07:43,830
Bark has genetically distinct uptown and
downtown that is fucking crazy.

1561
01:07:45,640 --> 01:07:48,430
There's so many of them too,
and when you see them there's like.

1562
01:07:49,350 --> 01:07:54,350
It's such a like an instantaneous 
feeling of panic and like moving 

1563
01:07:54,350 --> 01:07:55,210
quickly.
I'm terrified of them.

1564
01:07:55,310 --> 01:08:00,310
I don't like it at all.
No ones running around your house like 

1565
01:08:00,310 --> 01:08:00,310
Jesus.
Oh Man.

1566
01:08:00,310 --> 01:08:00,310
Oh Man.
I to get my son.

1567
01:08:00,310 --> 01:08:01,540
He's over there.
I just want to run away.

1568
01:08:01,630 --> 01:08:06,630
I've had friends that were camping and 
one ran over their face while they're 

1569
01:08:06,630 --> 01:08:07,180
sleeping.
That caring pizza.

1570
01:08:08,250 --> 01:08:10,120
Do you ever seen the one that kills a 
pigeon?

1571
01:08:11,100 --> 01:08:16,070
You see the rat killing the pigeon.
This rat killed a fucking pigeon and was

1572
01:08:16,070 --> 01:08:19,010
killing it in front of all these people 
in New York City in a park.

1573
01:08:19,100 --> 01:08:20,540
Look at this.
Whoa.

1574
01:08:20,750 --> 01:08:22,270
Yeah.
Killing the pigeons.

1575
01:08:22,280 --> 01:08:26,450
The pigeons alive.
The rat got ahold of the pigeon and look

1576
01:08:26,451 --> 01:08:28,280
how much stronger they are.
Then pigeons,

1577
01:08:28,610 --> 01:08:30,950
he's just carrying that poor fucking 
pigeon around.

1578
01:08:31,410 --> 01:08:36,050
He's taking a break now who winded 
fucking hard out there carrying and he's

1579
01:08:36,051 --> 01:08:41,051
like,
he's really trying to do the choke hold 

1580
01:08:41,051 --> 01:08:41,051
on him.
He's killing it.

1581
01:08:41,051 --> 01:08:44,620
I mean,
he's a Predator like I never would have 

1582
01:08:44,620 --> 01:08:44,620
imagined.
I never thought that rats are predators.

1583
01:08:44,620 --> 01:08:49,540
Yeah.
I thought of him as just being sort of 

1584
01:08:49,540 --> 01:08:49,540
scavengers,
but this is.

1585
01:08:49,540 --> 01:08:50,570
This is fucking pigeons alive,
dude.

1586
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:52,790
He's eating this pigeon and he's killing
it.

1587
01:08:53,140 --> 01:08:54,320
Drag it in a way.
Look at him.

1588
01:08:55,220 --> 01:08:56,390
Oh yeah.
He's taken this.

1589
01:08:56,740 --> 01:08:57,920
Wow.
Look at.

1590
01:08:57,921 --> 01:08:58,940
He's trying to get away.
Fuck you.

1591
01:08:59,150 --> 01:09:00,740
Fuck you.
Pigeons.

1592
01:09:00,741 --> 01:09:01,400
All jacked.

1593
01:09:01,490 --> 01:09:02,910
Pigeons trying to get away trying.
No,

1594
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:04,250
that's chasing them.
Look at that.

1595
01:09:04,750 --> 01:09:09,440
That is so whoever's doing the camera.
There's terrible at it.

1596
01:09:09,470 --> 01:09:12,560
He got it.
That's wild,

1597
01:09:12,561 --> 01:09:13,080
man.
He's going.

1598
01:09:13,820 --> 01:09:14,570
Oh,
we dropped it.

1599
01:09:14,690 --> 01:09:16,130
Oh,
where are you going with still alive?

1600
01:09:16,160 --> 01:09:17,310
Yeah,
in a man.

1601
01:09:17,311 --> 01:09:19,580
It's fighting book.
I was writing it.

1602
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:22,460
I was like,
he's got back control and said the first

1603
01:09:22,461 --> 01:09:24,060
time doing it,
you know he's bobbing,

1604
01:09:24,110 --> 01:09:24,770
killing.
He's like,

1605
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:27,450
that one changed.
That'd been killing birds for a minute,

1606
01:09:27,451 --> 01:09:28,670
man.
He realized like,

1607
01:09:28,671 --> 01:09:30,380
you know what man?
Fuck cheeseburgers.

1608
01:09:30,710 --> 01:09:33,670
You can get your own fresh meat fresh.
Got It.

1609
01:09:34,310 --> 01:09:36,470
Do you know the pigeons were actually 
brought in for food?

1610
01:09:36,890 --> 01:09:38,930
No.
That's what squad is.

1611
01:09:39,410 --> 01:09:42,110
When you go to a fancy restaurant and 
have a squabble pigeon.

1612
01:09:42,320 --> 01:09:43,500
Pigeon.
Yeah.

1613
01:09:43,870 --> 01:09:47,680
I went to a restaurant the other day 
that had squabbles it good.

1614
01:09:48,220 --> 01:09:48,670
I don't know.

1615
01:09:48,680 --> 01:09:50,330
I didn't need it.
It's probably good.

1616
01:09:50,510 --> 01:09:54,080
What'd you have?
I had steak instead of tried and true,

1617
01:09:54,710 --> 01:09:58,800
but squabbles like pigeon.
They brought them in for food that's not

1618
01:09:58,820 --> 01:10:00,650
as a non native bird.
Their squad.

1619
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:03,950
There you go.
Little pigeon dish looks good.

1620
01:10:03,980 --> 01:10:06,200
Fire Grill looks good there and that 
funny though,

1621
01:10:06,201 --> 01:10:08,790
they have to call it squad.
It's like nobody wants to eat it.

1622
01:10:09,140 --> 01:10:10,150
It wasn't pigeon.
Yeah.

1623
01:10:10,151 --> 01:10:13,300
That wouldn't sell as well.
People aren't eating pigeons.

1624
01:10:13,580 --> 01:10:17,990
Plug that those pigeons.
Goddamn squad farm in Los Angeles.

1625
01:10:17,991 --> 01:10:19,370
Back in the design.
Yeah.

1626
01:10:19,371 --> 01:10:22,010
All these things I think.
I believe they brought them in.

1627
01:10:22,650 --> 01:10:25,100
I want to say from Europe,
but I might just be guessing that.

1628
01:10:25,610 --> 01:10:27,960
But pitches or non native?
Yeah.

1629
01:10:28,100 --> 01:10:30,860
La was once home to the largest pigeon.
Fuck God.

1630
01:10:30,890 --> 01:10:32,000
Damn.
That's crazy.

1631
01:10:32,550 --> 01:10:33,270
That's near,
isn't it?

1632
01:10:33,271 --> 01:10:34,760
Near Dodgers Stadium,
right?

1633
01:10:35,500 --> 01:10:36,230
Right.
Yeah.

1634
01:10:36,260 --> 01:10:39,470
Christian Park.
Was it Alucien Park now?

1635
01:10:39,470 --> 01:10:42,170
Why are they just sitting there?
It's a painting,

1636
01:10:42,250 --> 01:10:43,160
but.
Oh,

1637
01:10:43,161 --> 01:10:43,850
is it?
Yeah.

1638
01:10:44,050 --> 01:10:46,060
Yeah,
but why would they be sitting there?

1639
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,020
There must be ton of feed there.
Right?

1640
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:51,470
Right.
And then how do they get them throw nuts

1641
01:10:51,471 --> 01:10:54,290
over him at the end of the day?
I don't know when they want to eat them.

1642
01:10:55,730 --> 01:10:57,020
Yeah,
there was a food source.

1643
01:10:57,260 --> 01:10:59,090
They brought them over as a food source 
from where?

1644
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:02,450
Like just I guess I want to say Europe.
Yeah,

1645
01:11:03,650 --> 01:11:05,420
but the alligator farm.
Oh,

1646
01:11:05,421 --> 01:11:10,421
great assholes.
You see that they had a 14 footer and 

1647
01:11:10,421 --> 01:11:11,080
someone's pulling in Florida.
Yeah.

1648
01:11:11,930 --> 01:11:14,040
Big fucking cage.
Oh Wow.

1649
01:11:14,070 --> 01:11:15,660
This little babies playing with 
alligators.

1650
01:11:16,170 --> 01:11:19,080
The fuck is that 19.
Oh,

1651
01:11:19,081 --> 01:11:23,430
six people were just different than they
were made out of wood or hardy.

1652
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:25,020
Even babies had callouses.

1653
01:11:27,450 --> 01:11:32,450
That is some shit that would not be done
today to leave your kid by the gator 

1654
01:11:32,450 --> 01:11:32,850
pool.
Oh yeah.

1655
01:11:33,060 --> 01:11:34,230
Cool.
Normal.

1656
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:36,370
We'll go have lunch.
That's not really.

1657
01:11:36,590 --> 01:11:37,560
Yeah,
it is.

1658
01:11:37,880 --> 01:11:38,680
Are.
Yeah,

1659
01:11:38,730 --> 01:11:42,300
California Alligator Farm Los Angeles.
If they're well fed,

1660
01:11:42,301 --> 01:11:43,470
you don't really have to worry about 
them.

1661
01:11:44,620 --> 01:11:46,380
Their welfare.
They're just tired.

1662
01:11:46,470 --> 01:11:48,240
Just chilling all the time.
Look at that guy though.

1663
01:11:48,241 --> 01:11:49,410
It doesn't even look.
You're a real person.

1664
01:11:49,411 --> 01:11:51,780
Real fake.
It's fake.

1665
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:57,480
It looks real fake.
I just think it's just shitty shitty 

1666
01:11:57,480 --> 01:11:57,480
photography and they probably added 
color to it later.

1667
01:11:58,770 --> 01:12:03,770
So Tommy buttons yet.
Tell me about the controversy 

1668
01:12:03,770 --> 01:12:06,150
surrounding your use of the r word in 
your last special.

1669
01:12:06,240 --> 01:12:09,450
Oh yeah,
it was good that that was,

1670
01:12:09,780 --> 01:12:12,180
that was bizarre.
It was a lot man.

1671
01:12:12,410 --> 01:12:14,340
It was.
Well it was also.

1672
01:12:14,550 --> 01:12:19,550
What I found interesting about it was 
people were lying about the bit and they

1673
01:12:21,001 --> 01:12:25,200
were doing it in articles and they were 
doing it in email campaigns.

1674
01:12:25,201 --> 01:12:26,970
They were lying about the content of the
bit.

1675
01:12:27,650 --> 01:12:30,690
There were changing what you were saying
in the bit and the.

1676
01:12:30,691 --> 01:12:35,691
They had to be doing it on purpose.
They definitely didn't listen to the 

1677
01:12:35,691 --> 01:12:35,691
bit.

1678
01:12:35,691 --> 01:12:36,610
Yeah.
And I think it took me a while to figure

1679
01:12:36,611 --> 01:12:41,611
out what was,
what really was happening was that 

1680
01:12:41,611 --> 01:12:45,420
someone,
someone's agenda or idea of what they 

1681
01:12:45,420 --> 01:12:49,201
want to accomplish is to highlight a 
campaign to eradicate saying a word and 

1682
01:12:50,951 --> 01:12:55,951
then they had a channel to pursue by 
having a comedy bit that did it,

1683
01:12:58,450 --> 01:12:59,920
but they could be like,
let's,

1684
01:12:59,970 --> 01:13:01,670
let's go after it like this.
Yeah,

1685
01:13:01,870 --> 01:13:03,250
but it didn't,
they didn't go.

1686
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:04,690
I mean,
you know,

1687
01:13:05,020 --> 01:13:07,480
basically what it was funny thing is 
that like the,

1688
01:13:07,540 --> 01:13:12,540
that joke was something that I worked 
back when I did that bit backwards.

1689
01:13:14,530 --> 01:13:18,280
In other words,
I had the end piece of the bit,

1690
01:13:18,660 --> 01:13:21,100
uh,
was that while I was doing by itself,

1691
01:13:21,370 --> 01:13:24,790
which was a story about I saw,
I witnessed a fight in Philly,

1692
01:13:25,240 --> 01:13:26,950
have a white guy,
a black guy in the park,

1693
01:13:27,370 --> 01:13:30,700
and the white dude was screaming and 
bombs and it was,

1694
01:13:30,730 --> 01:13:31,480
it was nuts.

1695
01:13:31,690 --> 01:13:34,140
So I would tell that story and then I 
would,

1696
01:13:34,190 --> 01:13:37,920
I worked backwards into getting into the
story because I always try to figure out

1697
01:13:37,930 --> 01:13:41,620
like if something funny happens or 
something I want to tell a story,

1698
01:13:41,890 --> 01:13:46,890
it's always better to figure out why are
you telling the story than just to be 

1699
01:13:46,890 --> 01:13:46,890
like,
here's the story.

1700
01:13:46,890 --> 01:13:49,090
Right.
So I told the story of the,

1701
01:13:49,180 --> 01:13:52,150
the fight in the park.
Then I worked into,

1702
01:13:52,180 --> 01:13:56,140
like I figured out right before that I'm
talking about racial slurs and how,

1703
01:13:56,680 --> 01:13:59,020
you know,
most racial slurs are not acceptable.

1704
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:04,200
And then I figured out they were like,
unless they're like white racial slurs 

1705
01:14:04,200 --> 01:14:08,431
are totally acceptable,
like call people mix and crowds and 

1706
01:14:08,431 --> 01:14:11,510
frogs,
polacks Guinea wipes like this whole 

1707
01:14:11,510 --> 01:14:11,510
list of that.
And then I worked before that,

1708
01:14:11,510 --> 01:14:16,230
just the way into saying that was like,
why should talk about words that you 

1709
01:14:16,230 --> 01:14:18,640
can't say that that kind of changed over
time.

1710
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:21,790
Right.
So it was just like one of those jokes.

1711
01:14:21,791 --> 01:14:22,120
It's like,
oh,

1712
01:14:22,121 --> 01:14:24,460
it's helping me get into the bit,
you know.

1713
01:14:24,461 --> 01:14:24,920
So I,
I,

1714
01:14:25,250 --> 01:14:27,690
I started the bit by saying,
uh,

1715
01:14:27,700 --> 01:14:29,450
you can't say retarded anymore,
does the,

1716
01:14:29,500 --> 01:14:31,990
that's the first line of the,
of the entire bit,

1717
01:14:32,410 --> 01:14:34,300
which ended up being like eight or 10 
minutes long.

1718
01:14:34,870 --> 01:14:38,150
And then people would say to me like,
to start with,

1719
01:14:38,160 --> 01:14:39,820
when I started getting mail about it,
they're like,

1720
01:14:39,821 --> 01:14:40,850
you know,
you can't say retarded.

1721
01:14:40,851 --> 01:14:43,240
And I go,
that's the line that I say like,

1722
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:45,190
yeah,
that's the line in the joke.

1723
01:14:45,340 --> 01:14:48,400
But they didn't hear the bet.
He will just heard that you were doing a

1724
01:14:48,401 --> 01:14:51,700
bit about the word retarded once it blew
up.

1725
01:14:51,910 --> 01:14:56,890
Like once it got to a huge amount of,
uh,

1726
01:14:56,920 --> 01:14:59,530
like when it was an organized,
orchestrated campaign,

1727
01:14:59,560 --> 01:15:02,650
you're right,
there was people messaging me that would

1728
01:15:02,651 --> 01:15:03,310
say,
um,

1729
01:15:03,380 --> 01:15:06,790
I heard you want to kill all children 
with down's.

1730
01:15:06,790 --> 01:15:07,540
And I'd be like,
what,

1731
01:15:08,680 --> 01:15:10,820
where did you see that facebook 
somewhere said it.

1732
01:15:10,821 --> 01:15:15,821
Someone said it does have the message 
messages I started to get and how many 

1733
01:15:15,821 --> 01:15:18,691
people at the height of it sign this 
petition to get you kicked off in that 

1734
01:15:18,691 --> 01:15:20,530
floats over 100,000.
Yeah.

1735
01:15:21,730 --> 01:15:23,140
But here's the thing,
here's what I mean.

1736
01:15:23,380 --> 01:15:27,700
I don't want to portray myself as a 
victim or anything,

1737
01:15:27,701 --> 01:15:28,360
right?
Like I,

1738
01:15:28,840 --> 01:15:33,840
I did a bit.
I can handle people not liking it or 

1739
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:33,840
liking it.
I mean,

1740
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:37,291
a lot of people message me that they 
were into it and I just didn't share 

1741
01:15:37,291 --> 01:15:39,130
those because you don't want to be like,
here's someone who said they like it,

1742
01:15:39,160 --> 01:15:41,710
you know,
and people and people,

1743
01:15:41,711 --> 01:15:44,710
even people with a children and siblings
and,

1744
01:15:44,711 --> 01:15:45,540
and,
uh,

1745
01:15:45,670 --> 01:15:47,170
with downstream messaged me,
you know,

1746
01:15:47,171 --> 01:15:50,470
I just didn't post those messages.
But I don't know,

1747
01:15:51,010 --> 01:15:56,010
I,
I'm not the victim in this whole thing 

1748
01:15:56,010 --> 01:15:56,010
at all.

1749
01:15:56,010 --> 01:15:58,470
I learned,
I feel like I learned that when people 

1750
01:15:58,470 --> 01:16:00,541
are super upset about something,
you have to let them just be upset and 

1751
01:16:00,541 --> 01:16:02,350
be outraged if they want to be outraged,
you know,

1752
01:16:02,590 --> 01:16:03,310
that's,
you're right.

1753
01:16:03,510 --> 01:16:08,510
It,
of course it's uncomfortable to me that 

1754
01:16:08,510 --> 01:16:09,100
you can't get out in front and be like,
Hey,

1755
01:16:09,101 --> 01:16:10,900
you're,
you're misrepresenting it.

1756
01:16:11,310 --> 01:16:16,310
Because people,
like even in the campaign language it 

1757
01:16:16,310 --> 01:16:17,950
said like,
we want this bit taken out of the,

1758
01:16:18,010 --> 01:16:23,010
of the joke.
We went the trailer for the special 

1759
01:16:23,010 --> 01:16:24,790
removed and I was like,
why?

1760
01:16:25,170 --> 01:16:30,170
And then I realized that the trailer has
a joke that they're confusing with the 

1761
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:34,150
joke where I say retarded,
like they're,

1762
01:16:34,300 --> 01:16:36,760
they think the two are related.
What's the one on the trailer?

1763
01:16:37,100 --> 01:16:38,380
The trailer is,
I say,

1764
01:16:38,381 --> 01:16:39,930
uh,
uh,

1765
01:16:40,150 --> 01:16:42,580
like some of something's funny.
Um,

1766
01:16:42,610 --> 01:16:45,400
disabilities are not funny,
but some are,

1767
01:16:45,670 --> 01:16:50,670
and it's a whole bit about obscure 
things like a foreign accent syndrome 

1768
01:16:50,890 --> 01:16:55,890
and oh,
it was hit on the head and then they 

1769
01:16:55,890 --> 01:16:55,890
start speaking in French.

1770
01:16:55,890 --> 01:16:57,670
So that was the setup to that bit.
And they were,

1771
01:16:57,880 --> 01:17:02,880
but they were saying they were basically
making it where that setup is about 

1772
01:17:03,280 --> 01:17:04,900
downs or something.
You know what I mean?

1773
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:07,030
Like,
but they happened 40 minutes apart.

1774
01:17:07,031 --> 01:17:09,740
One has nothing to do with the other,
but by not it,

1775
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:11,600
by just watching the trailer,
they're going,

1776
01:17:11,630 --> 01:17:16,630
oh see,
this is like how he's making fun of us 

1777
01:17:16,630 --> 01:17:19,220
will.
You shouldn't even have a point where 

1778
01:17:19,220 --> 01:17:19,220
you could say some disabilities are 
funny.

1779
01:17:19,220 --> 01:17:19,400
Right?
You,

1780
01:17:19,440 --> 01:17:20,780
she can't do that.
Right?

1781
01:17:20,840 --> 01:17:22,010
Yeah,
that's what,

1782
01:17:22,040 --> 01:17:23,420
that's what I was told.
It's,

1783
01:17:23,660 --> 01:17:28,660
it's what it is,
is the new power that people have to 

1784
01:17:28,660 --> 01:17:29,570
complain.
I mean people have always complained but

1785
01:17:29,571 --> 01:17:34,571
they haven't had the instantaneous 
access to complaining and then you can 

1786
01:17:34,571 --> 01:17:38,531
get.
And here's the thing I learned about 

1787
01:17:38,531 --> 01:17:39,380
Kinda like mob mentality too.
That was kind of fascinating to watch.

1788
01:17:39,410 --> 01:17:41,810
I mean I was in it so it's different.
Once I could step back,

1789
01:17:42,110 --> 01:17:45,980
I realized that once you get signed to a
certain message out,

1790
01:17:46,430 --> 01:17:51,430
you know,
people would read the thing that says 

1791
01:17:51,430 --> 01:17:52,850
this guy hates people with downs.
And I'm like,

1792
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:57,880
what?
And that's not a hard thing to get 

1793
01:17:57,880 --> 01:17:57,880
behind.
Oh yeah,

1794
01:17:57,880 --> 01:18:01,630
so then people would just,
they would sign it and I would also get 

1795
01:18:01,630 --> 01:18:03,350
messages that said things like,
uh,

1796
01:18:03,410 --> 01:18:06,410
I didn't know evil like you existed in 
this world,

1797
01:18:06,530 --> 01:18:07,370
you know,
things like that,

1798
01:18:07,371 --> 01:18:08,240
and I'd be like,
what,

1799
01:18:08,870 --> 01:18:11,030
and you're isis.
I mean,

1800
01:18:11,031 --> 01:18:14,900
like really crazy stuff man.
And I didn't engage nearly,

1801
01:18:14,901 --> 01:18:16,000
you know,
the,

1802
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:19,250
the amount of people that,
that would contact me.

1803
01:18:19,251 --> 01:18:24,251
But I did engage a few.
I did like go back and forth with one 

1804
01:18:24,251 --> 01:18:24,251
guy.
He was like,

1805
01:18:24,251 --> 01:18:24,950
he opened,
he was like,

1806
01:18:24,951 --> 01:18:27,110
you fucking cock sucking piece of shit.

1807
01:18:27,410 --> 01:18:29,630
I would stab you if I saw you on the 
street.

1808
01:18:29,631 --> 01:18:30,980
And I go,
what's this all about?

1809
01:18:31,010 --> 01:18:36,010
That was my,
like my opening thing to him and he was 

1810
01:18:36,010 --> 01:18:36,010
like,
I heard you,

1811
01:18:36,010 --> 01:18:40,150
uh,
you want to kill everybody with Down's 

1812
01:18:40,150 --> 01:18:40,150
syndrome.
And I'm like,

1813
01:18:40,150 --> 01:18:43,220
what are you talking about men?
And then we had a back and forth about,

1814
01:18:43,640 --> 01:18:44,630
about the bit.
I'm like,

1815
01:18:44,660 --> 01:18:46,820
you should go watch it,
you know,

1816
01:18:47,150 --> 01:18:50,070
just watch it and then get back to me.
And then he writes me that.

1817
01:18:50,071 --> 01:18:50,810
He was like,
yeah,

1818
01:18:51,020 --> 01:18:51,770
yeah,
yeah.

1819
01:18:51,800 --> 01:18:56,800
Sorry.
The way I spoke earlier didn't was 

1820
01:18:56,800 --> 01:18:57,360
fucking seriously was stabbed me.
He saw me.

1821
01:18:57,361 --> 01:18:58,970
He would have killed me.
You'd be in jail forever.

1822
01:18:59,130 --> 01:19:01,850
They'd be like a defendant,
please rise.

1823
01:19:02,110 --> 01:19:03,380
Well,
I just dabbed Mr Herrera.

1824
01:19:03,381 --> 01:19:04,930
I didn't see the bits.
I didn't walk.

1825
01:19:05,240 --> 01:19:08,030
I didn't watch the bed.
Somebody told me it was a but at the St.

1826
01:19:08,170 --> 01:19:13,170
terrible things about in the now in 
there and people's defense who got 

1827
01:19:13,170 --> 01:19:13,170
upset.
Some people watched it and they're like,

1828
01:19:13,170 --> 01:19:14,900
I saw it.
I don't think it's horrible and I think,

1829
01:19:14,901 --> 01:19:16,040
you know,
I'm like,

1830
01:19:16,041 --> 01:19:17,450
okay.
You know?

1831
01:19:17,540 --> 01:19:19,100
Yeah.
But there's some people that if you just

1832
01:19:19,101 --> 01:19:21,860
say the word,
say the word retarded,

1833
01:19:21,861 --> 01:19:23,750
like that's it,
it's over.

1834
01:19:23,780 --> 01:19:26,420
You can't do that.
It's like so many other words.

1835
01:19:26,480 --> 01:19:31,480
Yeah.
But it's gotten to the point where you 

1836
01:19:31,480 --> 01:19:33,851
don't even say the word Nigger,
like just saying it.

1837
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:36,350
It's like,
Holy Shit,

1838
01:19:36,351 --> 01:19:40,040
what are you doing?
We'll say the n word instead of it.

1839
01:19:40,130 --> 01:19:42,410
Right.
And you're not even calling someone yet,

1840
01:19:42,411 --> 01:19:45,020
but it just acknowledging it that that's
a real word.

1841
01:19:45,021 --> 01:19:46,340
It's like a forbidden thing.
Well,

1842
01:19:46,341 --> 01:19:50,390
part of this campaign is to refer to it 
as the r word,

1843
01:19:50,410 --> 01:19:50,870
like.
Yeah,

1844
01:19:50,900 --> 01:19:52,910
say it right.
You should never say it.

1845
01:19:53,240 --> 01:19:54,230
I mean,
it's weird,

1846
01:19:54,231 --> 01:19:55,460
man.
Yeah,

1847
01:19:55,461 --> 01:19:56,300
I mean,
you know,

1848
01:19:57,350 --> 01:19:58,940
people.
People were,

1849
01:19:59,660 --> 01:20:03,190
some people were very,
very upset about it and you know,

1850
01:20:03,200 --> 01:20:08,200
I,
I get why someone could be upset about 

1851
01:20:08,200 --> 01:20:08,200
it.
It's not like I go like,

1852
01:20:08,200 --> 01:20:08,430
I don't even understand how you can be 
upset.

1853
01:20:08,700 --> 01:20:13,700
I mean,
the natural thing I think if you're a 

1854
01:20:13,700 --> 01:20:15,300
comic is you want to walk someone 
through the joke,

1855
01:20:15,390 --> 01:20:19,140
but what you realize later is like 
somebody who's,

1856
01:20:19,320 --> 01:20:24,320
who's,
who's advocating to stop saying a word 

1857
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:25,860
that doesn't care the details of the 
joke.

1858
01:20:25,910 --> 01:20:30,910
I mean the joke.
Here's the other thing that sucks about 

1859
01:20:30,910 --> 01:20:30,910
reading.
People would read transcripts.

1860
01:20:30,910 --> 01:20:34,230
It's like,
transcripts have no intent tone.

1861
01:20:34,300 --> 01:20:36,450
You know,
if you just read people's like,

1862
01:20:36,630 --> 01:20:39,690
I know we've talked about what your 
closing on now,

1863
01:20:39,691 --> 01:20:41,160
which will probably close out your 
special.

1864
01:20:41,340 --> 01:20:43,320
If you just type that out and give us 
the one,

1865
01:20:43,321 --> 01:20:45,010
they'd be like,
you like,

1866
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:49,440
you're a horrible man,
but it's in a couple of days.

1867
01:20:49,440 --> 01:20:54,440
It's like it's in the context of a 
comedy show where there's an unspoken 

1868
01:20:54,440 --> 01:20:55,770
agreement between performer and 
audience.

1869
01:20:56,130 --> 01:20:58,020
It's the intent.
Like what?

1870
01:20:58,021 --> 01:21:03,021
How did you intend this bit to go tone?
You mean is it said satirically?

1871
01:21:03,421 --> 01:21:07,570
Ironically,
that bit what I'm doing in the bit is,

1872
01:21:07,610 --> 01:21:12,480
is basically lamenting but accepting 
that words are changing,

1873
01:21:12,500 --> 01:21:13,740
right?
Like that's the tone of it.

1874
01:21:14,070 --> 01:21:16,800
The tone of it is I'm going like,
can't say retarded anymore.

1875
01:21:16,801 --> 01:21:18,720
That fucking sucks.
But I'm also like,

1876
01:21:19,110 --> 01:21:20,460
alright,
you know what I mean?

1877
01:21:20,461 --> 01:21:21,780
Like you're saying,
okay,

1878
01:21:21,810 --> 01:21:24,210
you want to do it,
and I make an example.

1879
01:21:24,211 --> 01:21:27,870
Like one thing that people got really 
upset about it was like I said,

1880
01:21:27,900 --> 01:21:30,000
at the end of this bit of the retarded 
part,

1881
01:21:30,001 --> 01:21:33,180
I say like you got now you got to be 
like that.

1882
01:21:33,181 --> 01:21:36,930
Your idea has an extra 21st chromosome 
if you asked me.

1883
01:21:37,050 --> 01:21:39,390
Right.
And then the next part,

1884
01:21:40,110 --> 01:21:45,110
the very next line that they would cut 
out when people were sharing this thing 

1885
01:21:45,110 --> 01:21:48,620
is I go like,
not the same meaning that the example 

1886
01:21:48,620 --> 01:21:51,810
was they purposely bad example.
The joke is that if you were to say 21st

1887
01:21:51,811 --> 01:21:53,490
chromosome,
it's absurd.

1888
01:21:53,491 --> 01:21:56,650
It doesn't work like you wouldn't make 
it,

1889
01:21:56,820 --> 01:22:01,820
but people would attack me and go like 
you're telling people to start saying 

1890
01:22:01,820 --> 01:22:01,820
that.
I'm like,

1891
01:22:01,820 --> 01:22:02,310
no,
I'm sharing that.

1892
01:22:02,311 --> 01:22:03,420
It's a bad idea.

1893
01:22:03,880 --> 01:22:08,880
I saw someone getting mad at someone 
calling someone stupid because they were

1894
01:22:09,581 --> 01:22:12,820
saying that's ablest.
Do you know what a it is?

1895
01:22:12,890 --> 01:22:14,540
Ablest.
Oh yeah.

1896
01:22:14,541 --> 01:22:17,690
Because you have your of sound.
You're able.

1897
01:22:17,900 --> 01:22:18,860
You're able to do it.
Yeah.

1898
01:22:18,930 --> 01:22:20,570
Yeah.
Like a.

1899
01:22:21,060 --> 01:22:25,650
If you are mocking someone who's 
diminished mentally.

1900
01:22:26,070 --> 01:22:27,300
Oh,
you fucking idiot.

1901
01:22:27,330 --> 01:22:28,310
That's ablest.
Yeah,

1902
01:22:28,710 --> 01:22:30,510
sure.
Which is crazy.

1903
01:22:30,600 --> 01:22:32,340
Yeah.
You're able bodied.

1904
01:22:32,850 --> 01:22:37,850
Their brain doesn't work so good.
You're an ableist if you call them 

1905
01:22:37,850 --> 01:22:40,821
stupid.
I mean it's going to get to the point 

1906
01:22:40,821 --> 01:22:42,330
where if you give up certain words,
I mean if we keep going like this,

1907
01:22:42,360 --> 01:22:47,360
it's going to get to the point where 
we're just gonna have a very hard time 

1908
01:22:47,360 --> 01:22:47,730
communicating effectively.
I totally agree.

1909
01:22:47,731 --> 01:22:49,380
I mean there's.
I don't know.

1910
01:22:49,500 --> 01:22:54,500
There's an.
Here's the thing that it is an endless 

1911
01:22:54,500 --> 01:22:54,500
cycle.
Yeah.

1912
01:22:54,500 --> 01:22:57,351
I mean,
we just don't have that next 

1913
01:22:57,351 --> 01:22:57,351
unacceptable word,
right.

1914
01:22:57,351 --> 01:22:58,740
You know,
like everybody knows.

1915
01:22:58,741 --> 01:23:03,741
I think a lot of people know that as far
as somebody who's a doesn't have is 

1916
01:23:03,741 --> 01:23:07,120
developmentally disabled.
Retarded was kind of the Mo.

1917
01:23:07,210 --> 01:23:10,900
The latest term that was once acceptable
is clearly not.

1918
01:23:10,900 --> 01:23:12,610
Now.
That is kind of the point.

1919
01:23:12,940 --> 01:23:14,200
But before that,
you know,

1920
01:23:14,290 --> 01:23:17,080
moron was a medical term wasn't.
Yeah,

1921
01:23:17,440 --> 01:23:21,790
mongoloid idiot was what they used to 
call 'em down syndrome children.

1922
01:23:21,850 --> 01:23:24,820
that was like 100 years ago was on the 
birth certificate.

1923
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:25,720
Right.
But I'm saying,

1924
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:28,570
you know,
people who are saying,

1925
01:23:29,110 --> 01:23:30,670
you know,
just to stop saying return,

1926
01:23:30,700 --> 01:23:35,700
they're not wrong,
but there is also another word down the 

1927
01:23:36,041 --> 01:23:36,730
pipeline,
right?

1928
01:23:36,731 --> 01:23:41,731
There's something else that's coming 
that's going to be a medical word or 

1929
01:23:41,731 --> 01:23:43,540
term and then that'll be used to insult 
people,

1930
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:48,600
but that's the way people use language.
Like once we identify this is the word 

1931
01:23:49,211 --> 01:23:53,710
people use to label someone with a 
developmental disability,

1932
01:23:54,040 --> 01:23:58,330
people in the slang will grow from that.
People will start using that.

1933
01:23:59,110 --> 01:24:04,110
Well,
what's interesting to me is that when 

1934
01:24:04,110 --> 01:24:07,350
we're talking about words,
you're not going to change the way 

1935
01:24:07,350 --> 01:24:07,350
people think.

1936
01:24:07,350 --> 01:24:08,310
So words are supposed to convey intent.
Yes.

1937
01:24:08,311 --> 01:24:13,311
Supposed to be sounds that we all agree 
mean a certain thing and the more depth,

1938
01:24:15,430 --> 01:24:20,430
the more access towards you have,
the more you can sort of flavor your 

1939
01:24:20,430 --> 01:24:21,280
conversation.
So I uNderstand what you're saying.

1940
01:24:21,580 --> 01:24:24,850
Like if you're saying this guy,
I kind of get it,

1941
01:24:24,851 --> 01:24:27,370
but you feel like this fucking guy.
I'm like,

1942
01:24:27,371 --> 01:24:28,860
well tom is really mad.
You know whaT I mean?

1943
01:24:28,980 --> 01:24:31,180
That and to take that out.
Yeah.

1944
01:24:31,270 --> 01:24:32,860
it's like,
I don't know.

1945
01:24:33,350 --> 01:24:37,900
So sometimes you take those things out 
when you're like on a television show or

1946
01:24:37,901 --> 01:24:41,140
something like that,
but all television shows because of that

1947
01:24:41,170 --> 01:24:46,060
all censored television shows only 
exists within a certain band.

1948
01:24:46,150 --> 01:24:48,430
Yes.
A certain frequency they'd never get out

1949
01:24:48,431 --> 01:24:50,560
of that.
Like the joey diaz frequency is like,

1950
01:24:50,561 --> 01:24:51,880
ah,
there's no fucking roof.

1951
01:24:52,210 --> 01:24:54,010
There's no fence.
Ah,

1952
01:24:54,250 --> 01:24:55,060
true.
This,

1953
01:24:55,210 --> 01:24:59,740
this frequency that you get on like late
night talk shows or a sitcom,

1954
01:24:59,980 --> 01:25:04,980
this very narrow band that,
that there's no concept in that band.

1955
01:25:05,560 --> 01:25:08,860
There's no motherfucker this,
all those things are not in there,

1956
01:25:08,890 --> 01:25:10,840
which is what you're all.
I feel like whenever you're.

1957
01:25:11,320 --> 01:25:13,360
For me,
when I'm watching something like that,

1958
01:25:13,720 --> 01:25:16,390
part of my Brain is always like,
go find a motherfucker somewhere.

1959
01:25:17,150 --> 01:25:19,610
You kind of want it.
Especially now we're,

1960
01:25:19,780 --> 01:25:22,060
we're just,
we're so used to being free,

1961
01:25:22,420 --> 01:25:25,330
especially us because a podcast and 
live,

1962
01:25:25,340 --> 01:25:26,260
stand up,
stand up,

1963
01:25:26,560 --> 01:25:31,560
you know,
and I was gonna bring this up like your 

1964
01:25:31,560 --> 01:25:32,881
show,
like your show that you do with your 

1965
01:25:32,881 --> 01:25:32,881
wife,
your mom's house.

1966
01:25:32,881 --> 01:25:37,380
If anybody just wanted to go cherry pick
things and write them down.

1967
01:25:38,170 --> 01:25:43,170
Write some of the things you guys joke 
around about where you're clearly 

1968
01:25:43,170 --> 01:25:45,220
joking,
but take it and write it down in quotes.

1969
01:25:45,221 --> 01:25:48,310
And then tom said to his wife,
oh yeah,

1970
01:25:48,400 --> 01:25:50,290
and by the way,
100,000

1971
01:25:50,291 --> 01:25:55,291
times worse than anything in life 
stanhope ever said is set on that 

1972
01:25:55,291 --> 01:25:55,291
podcast.
I mean,

1973
01:25:55,291 --> 01:25:58,510
it's not even comparable.
It's so much worse.

1974
01:25:58,540 --> 01:26:03,540
The content.
It's like we don't go into the show of 

1975
01:26:03,540 --> 01:26:03,590
like,
let's be offensive,

1976
01:26:03,890 --> 01:26:04,160
but

1977
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:08,930
we play in a no rules like have fun 
environment.

1978
01:26:09,390 --> 01:26:10,880
You know,
it's like free flowing,

1979
01:26:11,450 --> 01:26:13,490
just say whatever.
And that's the fun of the show.

1980
01:26:13,730 --> 01:26:18,730
Yeah.
And it's also everybody knows you're 

1981
01:26:18,730 --> 01:26:20,810
joking.
The fan base is like 100 percent on 

1982
01:26:20,810 --> 01:26:24,881
board with this is an uncensored just 
loose,

1983
01:26:25,160 --> 01:26:27,230
fun going for it,
going for jokes.

1984
01:26:27,290 --> 01:26:31,010
What I also found too is that during 
this whole controversy,

1985
01:26:31,011 --> 01:26:35,060
after your special was released,
you got bigger.

1986
01:26:35,450 --> 01:26:40,450
It's like people,
they by doing that campaign and then 

1987
01:26:40,450 --> 01:26:45,040
people who did investigate the guy 
actually this guy was really fucking 

1988
01:26:45,040 --> 01:26:45,040
funny.
I mean I got,

1989
01:26:45,040 --> 01:26:45,800
I usually,
you know,

1990
01:26:45,801 --> 01:26:50,801
again,
I never publicize these things because 

1991
01:26:50,801 --> 01:26:50,801
it's gross,
you know,

1992
01:26:50,801 --> 01:26:52,160
to be like check out this compliment or 
whatever.

1993
01:26:52,790 --> 01:26:55,940
But like I got so manY messages from 
people who are like,

1994
01:26:56,210 --> 01:27:01,210
I saw this thing on the news because it 
was on a lot of local news that there's 

1995
01:27:01,210 --> 01:27:03,080
a controversial netflix thing out.

1996
01:27:03,590 --> 01:27:07,130
People would message me and I saw this 
thing so I decided to check you out.

1997
01:27:07,131 --> 01:27:12,131
new fan,
just bought tickets to see you at blah 

1998
01:27:12,131 --> 01:27:14,111
blah blah.
So I started to get a bunch of messages 

1999
01:27:14,111 --> 01:27:17,051
like that for sure,
because you're going to get 30 percent 

2000
01:27:17,051 --> 01:27:17,051
of the people that aren't even going to 
read it,

2001
01:27:17,051 --> 01:27:17,300
they're just going to call you piece of 
shit,

2002
01:27:17,570 --> 01:27:19,910
but the other people are going to go,
what is going on over here?

2003
01:27:19,911 --> 01:27:24,911
And then next thing you know they're 
going to investigate and they got to go 

2004
01:27:24,911 --> 01:27:24,911
what?
They're doing.

2005
01:27:24,911 --> 01:27:24,911
This guy dirty.
Yeah.

2006
01:27:24,911 --> 01:27:25,970
Yeah.
And then boom,

2007
01:27:26,420 --> 01:27:29,510
I got a lot of.
I got a lot of support that I never.

2008
01:27:30,050 --> 01:27:35,050
Like I said,
I never made light of the fact that 

2009
01:27:35,050 --> 01:27:35,050
people were being supportive,
but people were being very supportive.

2010
01:27:35,050 --> 01:27:36,800
Well,
it just seems like there,

2011
01:27:36,860 --> 01:27:41,860
there's different,
there's different rules now for standup 

2012
01:27:41,860 --> 01:27:42,500
and you got to really cover your ass.

2013
01:27:42,620 --> 01:27:47,620
But in your case you did cover your ass 
and they disingenuously left that part 

2014
01:27:48,111 --> 01:27:50,810
out.
Like they deceptively left that out when

2015
01:27:50,811 --> 01:27:52,430
they were writing down what you had 
said.

2016
01:27:52,630 --> 01:27:55,070
He didn't put it in the context.
That's true.

2017
01:27:55,071 --> 01:27:55,760
And uh,
and then,

2018
01:27:55,761 --> 01:27:58,280
you know,
part of you goes a man,

2019
01:27:58,281 --> 01:28:03,281
like I'm not trying to paint myself as a
martyr or you know what I mean,

2020
01:28:04,610 --> 01:28:08,240
and like people who are going down this 
path of,

2021
01:28:08,780 --> 01:28:13,780
you know,
they have family or friends with a 

2022
01:28:13,780 --> 01:28:16,890
disability.
It's like I'm not gonna my whole thing 

2023
01:28:16,890 --> 01:28:20,711
was never to attack them,
so I'm not going to try to make it a 

2024
01:28:20,711 --> 01:28:23,120
battle that I have to win.
So once,

2025
01:28:23,360 --> 01:28:26,870
once I saw like kind of what I thought 
clearly was happening,

2026
01:28:26,900 --> 01:28:27,560
I was like,
you know,

2027
01:28:27,561 --> 01:28:32,561
just let people vent their frustration 
about if it's about me or about what I 

2028
01:28:32,561 --> 01:28:33,710
said,
just let it happen.

2029
01:28:33,860 --> 01:28:34,910
And um,
you know,

2030
01:28:34,911 --> 01:28:39,911
because I don't,
I don't hold it against them that 

2031
01:28:39,911 --> 01:28:41,891
they're,
that they have that they're upset about 

2032
01:28:41,891 --> 01:28:41,891
this issue,
you know?

2033
01:28:41,891 --> 01:28:43,600
And even though like you're saying your 
instinct is,

2034
01:28:43,660 --> 01:28:45,140
is wants to go like,
hold on,

2035
01:28:45,170 --> 01:28:47,050
why don't you put it clearly.
RighT.

2036
01:28:47,070 --> 01:28:49,670
I said,
after a moment of it,

2037
01:28:49,671 --> 01:28:52,940
I realized that that wasn't the point 
for me in that,

2038
01:28:52,941 --> 01:28:55,070
in that time I was like,
just let people.

2039
01:28:55,440 --> 01:28:57,170
Because I also figured out that if 
people,

2040
01:28:57,330 --> 01:28:58,940
yeah,
a lot of people were going to read it,

2041
01:28:59,540 --> 01:29:04,540
say something and go like,
this guy's fucking worst and it's kind 

2042
01:29:04,540 --> 01:29:04,540
of feels good.
Sometimes it'd be like,

2043
01:29:04,540 --> 01:29:06,820
you want to know who the bad guy is,
this guy and I,

2044
01:29:06,860 --> 01:29:08,280
you know,
even though you want to be like,

2045
01:29:08,281 --> 01:29:10,460
hey,
I'm not that bad of a guy a.

2046
01:29:10,680 --> 01:29:15,680
If someone wants to just go there,
you just kind of have to let it go and 

2047
01:29:15,680 --> 01:29:19,050
then let the people who were enjoying it
or who were investigating it and finding

2048
01:29:19,051 --> 01:29:19,440
like,
oh,

2049
01:29:19,441 --> 01:29:21,240
it's a little different than it's being 
presented.

2050
01:29:21,440 --> 01:29:22,730
Yeah,
discovery.

2051
01:29:22,750 --> 01:29:23,050
That one.

2052
01:29:23,220 --> 01:29:27,990
There's so many outlets that are looking
for outrageous stories.

2053
01:29:28,110 --> 01:29:29,010
Yeah,
that's true.

2054
01:29:29,011 --> 01:29:31,800
More than ever.
And recreational outlet age,

2055
01:29:32,010 --> 01:29:35,150
recreational outrage.
Peddlers or like an an all time high and

2056
01:29:35,151 --> 01:29:36,420
there's so many people out there that 
are working.

2057
01:29:36,450 --> 01:29:41,450
The journalists,
the writers they work in for these 

2058
01:29:41,450 --> 01:29:42,150
websites and they got to produce 
content.

2059
01:29:42,151 --> 01:29:42,420
Man,

2060
01:29:42,470 --> 01:29:47,470
I got to tell you,
the one of the most amazing discoveries 

2061
01:29:47,470 --> 01:29:51,100
of that process is not the people who 
got upset at me and would start whatever

2062
01:29:52,340 --> 01:29:54,260
emailing,
saying pam saying things.

2063
01:29:54,650 --> 01:29:59,650
It was the reporters who would do these 
news pieces and also not familiar with 

2064
01:30:00,771 --> 01:30:02,690
what they were reporting.
They don't care.

2065
01:30:03,230 --> 01:30:06,140
I don't send that kind of make.
I mean doesn't that kind of stand out to

2066
01:30:06,141 --> 01:30:11,141
you?
Like you'Re gonna you're going to do a 

2067
01:30:11,141 --> 01:30:12,980
piece on television that you report to?
I don't know how many people.

2068
01:30:13,220 --> 01:30:18,220
And you're not familiar.
You can tell that they had not even 

2069
01:30:18,220 --> 01:30:18,820
watched the clip.
Yeah,

2070
01:30:19,040 --> 01:30:20,370
and they're doing.
It wasn't like a,

2071
01:30:20,470 --> 01:30:25,470
just an anchor reading copy.
It was the person doing the piece aBout 

2072
01:30:25,470 --> 01:30:29,831
It.
Had no idea what they were talking 

2073
01:30:29,831 --> 01:30:29,831
about.
Yeah,

2074
01:30:29,831 --> 01:30:29,831
they're lazy,
super lazy.

2075
01:30:29,831 --> 01:30:31,200
There's a lot of bad shit out there just
to.

2076
01:30:31,330 --> 01:30:36,330
People just barely just phone it in 
barely paying attention to what they're 

2077
01:30:36,591 --> 01:30:39,590
doing and then pretending that they're 
on the moral high ground.

2078
01:30:39,680 --> 01:30:42,050
Yeah.
You got to like.

2079
01:30:42,290 --> 01:30:47,290
But I think it's kind of a challenge too
because it forces me to like really 

2080
01:30:47,290 --> 01:30:48,700
cover all my bases and in these bits.
Yeah.

2081
01:30:48,740 --> 01:30:52,250
Like I did that with the bruce jenner 
bit from last year.

2082
01:30:52,370 --> 01:30:56,480
Like I was trying to figure out a way to
make fun of this.

2083
01:30:56,510 --> 01:30:58,220
I'm like,
what is the best way to make fun of it?

2084
01:30:58,221 --> 01:31:03,221
Well,
the parallel to my own life that have 

2085
01:31:03,221 --> 01:31:03,221
never been more of a bitch.
I've never been happier.

2086
01:31:03,221 --> 01:31:06,140
But I live with all girls and I'm never 
been more of a bitch.

2087
01:31:06,141 --> 01:31:08,690
I just given everything around me all 
the time.

2088
01:31:08,700 --> 01:31:13,700
Sure.
And that I'm not going out like bruce 

2089
01:31:13,700 --> 01:31:17,201
jenner,
that I've never been more of a bitch in 

2090
01:31:17,201 --> 01:31:17,201
my life.

2091
01:31:17,201 --> 01:31:17,240
But I'm not going out like that is 
people like,

2092
01:31:17,270 --> 01:31:22,270
oh,
he's always been a man that's really a 

2093
01:31:22,270 --> 01:31:22,480
woman,
a woman trapped in a man's body.

2094
01:31:22,481 --> 01:31:23,090
I'm like,
maybe,

2095
01:31:23,600 --> 01:31:28,600
maybe,
or maybe if you live with crazy bitches 

2096
01:31:28,600 --> 01:31:29,270
long enough,
you fucking become one maybe.

2097
01:31:29,510 --> 01:31:31,970
Did you get a lot of for that?
You had to get some right?

2098
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:37,000
None.
I skated through that one as well 

2099
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:37,000
because i.
First of all,

2100
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:38,270
I caught it right when people were 
annoyed.

2101
01:31:38,440 --> 01:31:39,020
Yeah,
right.

2102
01:31:39,021 --> 01:31:39,920
When people are like,
okay,

2103
01:31:39,921 --> 01:31:41,720
enough of this,
like I rode.

2104
01:31:41,721 --> 01:31:44,360
The timing was really good.
Like when it came out,

2105
01:31:44,361 --> 01:31:49,361
it's like people like enough the fucking
articles and she's pretending she's 

2106
01:31:49,361 --> 01:31:51,710
beautiful and she's amazing and stopped.
Stopped.

2107
01:31:51,920 --> 01:31:55,420
What about the fact she killed somebody?
What about the ones to.

2108
01:31:55,790 --> 01:31:57,830
Kyle does.
Kyle does a whole bit.

2109
01:31:58,030 --> 01:32:00,760

2113
01:32:13,210 --> 01:32:13,690

2114
01:32:14,890 --> 01:32:17,350
I just got my driver's license back,

2115
01:32:17,351 --> 01:32:17,920
Man,

01:32:18,310 --> 01:32:21,400
Fuck me when he killed that lady with 
the chicago right now.

2117
01:32:21,430 --> 01:32:26,430

but I'm a much better driver then broke 

2118
01:32:26,500 --> 01:32:29,360

Don't be afraid to hit the streets.

2119
01:32:31,090 --> 01:32:32,470
Retarded kid.

Oh yeah.
There you go.

2121
01:32:45,230 --> 01:32:49,630
Tied everything together.
That was the lower one with todd.

2122
01:32:49,680 --> 01:32:50,780
What's trump?
Who's that?

2123
01:32:50,781 --> 01:32:53,380
With trump in the corner with the girl.
Who's that?

2124
01:32:53,520 --> 01:32:54,450

Hi danny.
It's stormy.

2126
01:32:57,871 --> 01:33:01,050
Danielle darby.
Why are you calling me here?

2127
01:33:01,740 --> 01:33:04,110
Because I can't stop thinking about our 
night.

2128
01:33:04,111 --> 01:33:09,111
They gather more hard.
A nobody but you like nine slash 11 to 

2129
01:33:11,271 --> 01:33:15,570
my athol ground.
Zero a meth.

2130
01:33:15,600 --> 01:33:19,550
But all I know about.
I haven't had go.

2131
01:33:19,710 --> 01:33:23,240
Don't call here again late.
I was going to tell you a bang.

2132
01:33:23,640 --> 01:33:25,830
Make it quick.
You have gonorrhea,

2133
01:33:25,831 --> 01:33:27,400
syphilis and super aids.

2134
01:33:36,070 --> 01:33:40,460
Face that face that he chose to.
It's such a perfect face for trump.

2135
01:33:40,490 --> 01:33:42,470
Oh my god.
Hilarious.

2136
01:33:43,490 --> 01:33:45,270
Oh my god.
Yeah.

2137
01:33:45,400 --> 01:33:50,400
Oh fuck.
Well kudos to netflix for the way they 

2138
01:33:50,400 --> 01:33:53,030
handled it because they just stepped 
back and just let it.

2139
01:33:53,031 --> 01:33:56,090
Let it.
Let the fucking erase washover.

2140
01:33:56,091 --> 01:33:57,890
Let the fire go out.
I kinda took,

2141
01:33:57,950 --> 01:34:01,310
I took cues from that after a minute 
because at first I was like,

2142
01:34:01,380 --> 01:34:04,160
I should fucking talk to people.
And then I kinda was like,

2143
01:34:04,161 --> 01:34:06,110
I'm just waiting for someone to kilo 
hooker,

2144
01:34:07,550 --> 01:34:10,490
someone's gonna to do something to take 
over in the news.

2145
01:34:10,491 --> 01:34:12,310
Now I got 20 minutes out of it too.
So that word.

2146
01:34:12,900 --> 01:34:13,510
Oh,
that's.

2147
01:34:13,720 --> 01:34:18,720
There you go.
I feel like you have to address 

2148
01:34:18,720 --> 01:34:18,720
something like that.
Oh yeah.

2149
01:34:18,720 --> 01:34:19,280
Why wouldn't do two chapels?
Got a bunch of shit.

2150
01:34:19,281 --> 01:34:22,380
It is new special about some shit that 
he got in trouble with his old special.

2151
01:34:22,550 --> 01:34:26,630
I'm hoping it goes,
goes this way.

2152
01:34:26,790 --> 01:34:27,710
It's.
I mean,

2153
01:34:27,711 --> 01:34:29,030
you know the audit.
Here's the thing.

2154
01:34:29,031 --> 01:34:33,290
When I do a show now,
the audience is so aware of that stuff.

2155
01:34:33,350 --> 01:34:34,400
Oh yeah.
That it's like,

2156
01:34:34,430 --> 01:34:37,010
it would be disingenuous for me to not 
mention it,

2157
01:34:37,070 --> 01:34:37,790
you know?
Yeah.

2158
01:34:37,791 --> 01:34:38,870
That becomes a thing,
right?

2159
01:34:38,930 --> 01:34:43,930
The more stand up you're doing,
the more people know what you're doing 

2160
01:34:43,930 --> 01:34:45,920
and then when something goes sideways,
that becomes a bit.

2161
01:34:46,160 --> 01:34:48,920
Yeah,
of course you're feeding off yourself.

2162
01:34:49,150 --> 01:34:51,470
Yeah,
yeah,

2163
01:34:51,760 --> 01:34:52,460
yeah.
that's true.

2164
01:34:52,550 --> 01:34:56,660
I mean,
I just say Louisiana and is like,

2165
01:34:56,840 --> 01:34:57,680
ah,
that's right.

2166
01:34:57,681 --> 01:34:58,800
The Louisiana,
they put.

2167
01:34:59,150 --> 01:35:04,150
That was the thing.
People get mad at you for real pissed 

2168
01:35:04,150 --> 01:35:04,150
off a whole state.
A whole state.

2169
01:35:04,150 --> 01:35:07,100
People were saying that they were saving
up bail money.

2170
01:35:07,130 --> 01:35:08,020
What?
I've never even.

2171
01:35:08,180 --> 01:35:09,650
I know,
it's like when I saw that,

2172
01:35:09,880 --> 01:35:10,900
yeah,
they're like,

2173
01:35:10,990 --> 01:35:15,990
I would see comments like we got to 
start saving our bail money because 

2174
01:35:15,990 --> 01:35:17,260
we're going to go fuck up thompson girl 
and then we can bail out.

2175
01:35:17,261 --> 01:35:18,970
I'm like,
you're saving up for that.

2176
01:35:19,300 --> 01:35:22,810
It's one of the most white trash,
fucking amazing,

2177
01:35:22,990 --> 01:35:26,140
shitty things I've ever heard.
So a savings account for bail.

2178
01:35:26,230 --> 01:35:28,150
what did you do about security after 
that?

2179
01:35:28,660 --> 01:35:30,190
Um,
I had to take some.

2180
01:35:30,390 --> 01:35:30,980
They,
like I was,

2181
01:35:31,120 --> 01:35:36,120
it was recommended to me by a whole 
bunch of industry people to take 

2182
01:35:36,120 --> 01:35:39,070
security precautions in Louisiana.
That's it.

2183
01:35:39,770 --> 01:35:44,770
They're just like,
well you sold out like crazy and 

2184
01:35:44,770 --> 01:35:46,451
Louisiana nine months in advance.
So you haven't even gotten there yet?

2185
01:35:47,931 --> 01:35:49,680
No,
no.

2186
01:35:49,970 --> 01:35:50,960
Yeah,
iT sold out.

2187
01:35:51,320 --> 01:35:52,000
We added.
Yeah,

2188
01:35:52,001 --> 01:35:54,320
it's going to be all dudes in the,
in the audience going like this.

2189
01:35:54,370 --> 01:35:56,060
Yeah.
I'm like,

2190
01:35:56,061 --> 01:35:56,690
you're kidding.

2191
01:35:57,060 --> 01:36:00,630
That money to attack.
That'd be hilarious if feel like we paid

2192
01:36:00,631 --> 01:36:03,540
you to fucking just certain states.
Yeah.

2193
01:36:03,600 --> 01:36:06,210
I've been shitting on Connecticut for 
years and we've had low back.

2194
01:36:07,050 --> 01:36:12,050
You're shitting on Connecticut.
Gets to meet people come up to me and 

2195
01:36:12,050 --> 01:36:16,401
they're like,
I'm talking like in a coffee shop 

2196
01:36:16,401 --> 01:36:16,401
somewhere.
Be like,

2197
01:36:16,401 --> 01:36:16,401
why does joe hey kinetic,

2198
01:36:17,070 --> 01:36:22,070
I don't really hate Connecticut.
One of my best friends lives in 

2199
01:36:22,070 --> 01:36:22,070
Connecticut.
Shout out to tommy junior,

2200
01:36:22,070 --> 01:36:23,790
don't really hate Connecticut.
I'm talking shit,

2201
01:36:23,880 --> 01:36:25,470
you got to understand,
and by the way,

2202
01:36:25,471 --> 01:36:28,420
if you get like real sensitive about 
your state,

2203
01:36:28,440 --> 01:36:31,680
it might be a fucking idiot stop.
It's a patch of dirt.

2204
01:36:31,681 --> 01:36:36,681
There's no real estate.
There's lines arbitrarily drawn in the 

2205
01:36:36,681 --> 01:36:39,711
sand.
You just drive near clock across this 

2206
01:36:39,711 --> 01:36:39,711
line.
Now you're in Massachusetts.

2207
01:36:39,711 --> 01:36:40,200
Does that make any sense to you?

2208
01:36:40,270 --> 01:36:40,630
Well,
no.

2209
01:36:40,631 --> 01:36:43,210
And the other thing is,
you know what helps you see that clearly

2210
01:36:43,510 --> 01:36:46,480
you've had this.
I know I had this for sure is moving.

2211
01:36:46,810 --> 01:36:48,940
When you move a bunch of times in your 
life,

2212
01:36:48,941 --> 01:36:50,230
you're like,
oh yeah,

2213
01:36:50,231 --> 01:36:53,050
like why?
Why would you be married in love to that

2214
01:36:53,051 --> 01:36:58,051
patch of land would never move.
They feel like a certain tie to that 

2215
01:36:58,391 --> 01:37:00,880
place and they don't.
They're more sensitive.

2216
01:37:01,640 --> 01:37:04,510
Like I've lived in Ohio,
Minnesota,

2217
01:37:05,350 --> 01:37:07,450
Wisconsin,
dc,

2218
01:37:07,570 --> 01:37:08,920
Maryland,
Florida,

2219
01:37:08,980 --> 01:37:13,980
Massachusetts and California and anytime
I've mentioned any one of those places,

2220
01:37:14,710 --> 01:37:17,290
somebody somewhere has been like,
that place fucking sucks.

2221
01:37:17,291 --> 01:37:18,010
I'm like,
okay,

2222
01:37:18,400 --> 01:37:20,100
sure.
Go ahead.

2223
01:37:20,120 --> 01:37:21,240
But like your birthplace,
sex,

2224
01:37:21,280 --> 01:37:22,540
fine.
I don't care man.

2225
01:37:22,720 --> 01:37:25,870
It's just a place that I was squeezed 
out of someone's vagina.

2226
01:37:25,990 --> 01:37:27,100
I don't care.
Yeah,

2227
01:37:27,101 --> 01:37:28,870
you moved around a lot.
You get it.

2228
01:37:29,260 --> 01:37:29,830
Yeah.
It's like,

2229
01:37:30,190 --> 01:37:34,840
why would you be so like people take it 
like you're insulting their family,

2230
01:37:34,930 --> 01:37:36,670
you know,
it is my family.

2231
01:37:36,700 --> 01:37:37,300
No,
it's not.

2232
01:37:37,410 --> 01:37:39,850
do you know where they,
the nuttiest about it?

2233
01:37:39,910 --> 01:37:41,650
Texas main.
Oh really?

2234
01:37:41,651 --> 01:37:43,480
They call them maniacs.
Really?

2235
01:37:43,510 --> 01:37:43,840
Yup.

2236
01:37:44,200 --> 01:37:49,200
I was doing gigs up in Maine and I was 
shitting on main and this guy was this 

2237
01:37:49,200 --> 01:37:53,101
old guy literally got up and he was 
blood in his eyes coming towards the 

2238
01:37:53,101 --> 01:37:55,040
stage screaming at me.
Yeah.

2239
01:37:55,260 --> 01:37:56,040
I had this whole bit

2240
01:37:56,040 --> 01:38:01,040
about how if you get pulled over that I 
got a speeding ticket when I was driving

2241
01:38:01,530 --> 01:38:04,830
because it's like there's this long 
stretch from portland and bangor.

2242
01:38:04,831 --> 01:38:07,050
It's like an hour drive where there's 
nothing on the road.

2243
01:38:07,310 --> 01:38:12,310
And I go,
I got a speeding ticket because they 

2244
01:38:12,310 --> 01:38:12,310
just,
you know,

2245
01:38:12,310 --> 01:38:12,310
you can't help yourself.
I go,

2246
01:38:12,310 --> 01:38:14,310
but you got to figure like the cops from
Maine,

2247
01:38:14,640 --> 01:38:18,270
you should be able to trick them.
And I had this whole bit about trick the

2248
01:38:18,271 --> 01:38:23,271
cop really fucking stupid copy,
throw a potato out the window with the 

2249
01:38:23,271 --> 01:38:23,910
potato go.
That's a pretty good one,

2250
01:38:24,420 --> 01:38:29,420
nice and round and the guy drives off 
and while I'm in the middle of doing 

2251
01:38:29,420 --> 01:38:30,360
this,
guy jumps up and he's screaming,

2252
01:38:30,540 --> 01:38:32,700
just screaming at me,
fuck you.

2253
01:38:32,910 --> 01:38:36,810
Fucking main is the best package date.
You're a piece of shit,

2254
01:38:36,811 --> 01:38:41,811
and he's really,
really mad at me and I couldn't believe 

2255
01:38:41,811 --> 01:38:41,811
it.

2256
01:38:41,811 --> 01:38:41,811
I was like,
do you really mad?

2257
01:38:41,811 --> 01:38:43,260
And someone's making fun of Maine.
he's going to be mad,

2258
01:38:43,261 --> 01:38:45,360
but I always think someone's got to be 
mad about something else.

2259
01:38:45,361 --> 01:38:47,790
Right.
That's their turf.

2260
01:38:48,300 --> 01:38:50,420
They're defending their turf.
That's right.

2261
01:38:50,430 --> 01:38:52,380
Yeah.
That's their spot.

2262
01:38:53,020 --> 01:38:54,840
Yeah.
They call them maniacs.

2263
01:38:55,310 --> 01:38:56,580
Yeah.
They get really,

2264
01:38:56,581 --> 01:38:57,810
really,
really angry.

2265
01:38:57,840 --> 01:39:00,270
It's funny people,
but people who have audiences will like,

2266
01:39:00,271 --> 01:39:02,220
if you like you,
people are nuts.

2267
01:39:02,330 --> 01:39:03,540
If you're like,
you're crazy people.

2268
01:39:03,541 --> 01:39:04,320
They're like,
that's cool.

2269
01:39:04,530 --> 01:39:09,530
I like that.
It was certain places like Texas is 

2270
01:39:09,530 --> 01:39:09,530
Texas.
Yeah.

2271
01:39:09,530 --> 01:39:13,250
I have a bit that I opened with in Texas
all the time about this one spot in 

2272
01:39:13,250 --> 01:39:13,770
Texas.
It's like it's.

2273
01:39:13,860 --> 01:39:17,130
It defines Texas pete,
like you ever seen.

2274
01:39:17,180 --> 01:39:19,260
You know what a buckeys is?
[inaudible]?

2275
01:39:19,440 --> 01:39:19,750
No.
Yeah.

2276
01:39:19,780 --> 01:39:22,080
This whole bit about buckets,
not like a gas station,

2277
01:39:22,081 --> 01:39:23,850
kind of.
It's like a gas station.

2278
01:39:23,890 --> 01:39:28,890
If you created a gas station while you 
were in the middle of a cocaine binge 

2279
01:39:28,890 --> 01:39:29,040
and someone said,
dude,

2280
01:39:29,041 --> 01:39:30,650
I want you to make me the ultimate 
guide.

2281
01:39:31,500 --> 01:39:33,150
That's true.
That's true.

2282
01:39:33,151 --> 01:39:38,151
It's fucking crazy pLace,
but it's so light and when you bring it 

2283
01:39:38,151 --> 01:39:38,530
up to texans,
they get all excited.

2284
01:39:38,531 --> 01:39:39,270
They get excited.
Yes.

2285
01:39:39,271 --> 01:39:39,930
It's like,
yeah,

2286
01:39:39,931 --> 01:39:43,380
this is something that defined.
That's a buckeys later that lose size of

2287
01:39:43,381 --> 01:39:45,480
that place doesn't even make sense.
No,

2288
01:39:45,510 --> 01:39:46,800
that's 100 pumps.
Easy.

2289
01:39:47,390 --> 01:39:50,010
Yeah.
You get 100 people pulling over for gas.

2290
01:39:50,011 --> 01:39:50,850
That's crazy.
I mean,

2291
01:39:51,060 --> 01:39:52,920
they're just all prepped for the end of 
the world.

2292
01:39:53,250 --> 01:39:57,990
There are stretches.
This is how dumb I am of a I 10 in Texas

2293
01:39:58,560 --> 01:40:03,560
that you will hit maybe like 75 miles 
without gas and you tempt fate,

2294
01:40:06,090 --> 01:40:07,560
you know,
if you're driving,

2295
01:40:07,740 --> 01:40:08,640
that's not good.
No,

2296
01:40:08,641 --> 01:40:10,500
and twice I've been like,
eh,

2297
01:40:10,501 --> 01:40:11,370
I'll get it.
The next one.

2298
01:40:12,060 --> 01:40:14,700
And almost been just fumes.
You know,

2299
01:40:15,130 --> 01:40:17,760
somebody did it in a tesla,
died out.

2300
01:40:18,030 --> 01:40:20,280
he died out of out driving with a tesla.

2301
01:40:22,440 --> 01:40:25,280
Good luck.
Some farmer pulls over seas.

2302
01:40:25,290 --> 01:40:28,130
You have your shitty electric scooter.
doesn't want to work anymore.

2303
01:40:29,100 --> 01:40:33,660
I read the elon musk is sleeping on the 
floor of the tesla factory.

2304
01:40:34,270 --> 01:40:39,270
They said he's sleeping on the floor of 
the tesla factory where they're trying 

2305
01:40:39,511 --> 01:40:42,160
to get production ready.
Uhm,

2306
01:40:42,630 --> 01:40:46,200
and that tesla's finally going to leave 
this eli musk is stressed.

2307
01:40:46,250 --> 01:40:50,400
oh son of a bitch.
Elon musk is stressed.

2308
01:40:50,460 --> 01:40:55,460
Says he's sleeping on the tesla factory 
floor and has no time to go home and 

2309
01:40:55,460 --> 01:40:56,500
shower.
Wow.

2310
01:40:57,320 --> 01:40:59,080
That guy's an animal.
He really is.

2311
01:40:59,560 --> 01:41:01,450
Has there ever been a guy who does more 
shit?

2312
01:41:02,290 --> 01:41:04,170
Benjamin franklin?
Nah,

2313
01:41:04,290 --> 01:41:06,610
but asshole with a kite and key.
Fuck,

2314
01:41:06,611 --> 01:41:10,150
that guy wouldn't teeth.
Now what he's done,

2315
01:41:10,840 --> 01:41:15,840
think of is he's in the middle of making
this boring company that bores holes 

2316
01:41:15,840 --> 01:41:18,670
under the ground and then they'll have 
the high speed train speed train.

2317
01:41:18,760 --> 01:41:21,160
Yeah.
He's in the middle of the hyperloop.

2318
01:41:21,610 --> 01:41:26,230
He's in the middle of space x.
He's in the middle of tesla production.

2319
01:41:26,260 --> 01:41:29,950
They got approved for those satellites 
to go in the space for the internet that

2320
01:41:30,480 --> 01:41:31,960
didn't hear about that.
Yeah,

2321
01:41:32,020 --> 01:41:32,710
yeah,
yeah.

2322
01:41:32,711 --> 01:41:34,720
At least can provide worldwide internet.
Right?

2323
01:41:34,780 --> 01:41:35,530
That's the idea.
Yeah,

2324
01:41:36,040 --> 01:41:37,150
dude.
Yeah.

2325
01:41:37,390 --> 01:41:42,390
It says,
how does one has one guy able to do so 

2326
01:41:42,390 --> 01:41:43,390
much?
It's a better.

2327
01:41:43,391 --> 01:41:45,550
Now the crazy thing.
I was saying the other day,

2328
01:41:47,020 --> 01:41:50,260
he's so smart that people just let them 
drill under the ground in la.

2329
01:41:50,330 --> 01:41:50,740
They're like,
yeah,

2330
01:41:50,741 --> 01:41:52,120
go ahead.
Go ahead man.

2331
01:41:52,180 --> 01:41:57,180
Nobody else like,
who the fuck would let anybody just 

2332
01:41:57,180 --> 01:41:57,180
drill into the ground?
Who do you.

2333
01:41:57,180 --> 01:42:01,800
Where do you,
what office do you walk into with that 

2334
01:42:01,800 --> 01:42:01,800
presentation?
You know,

2335
01:42:01,800 --> 01:42:06,770
it's like people,
it's like a six month thing to build a 

2336
01:42:06,770 --> 01:42:06,770
fence in la.
He was like,

2337
01:42:06,770 --> 01:42:10,410
nice to go down a bunch like way far and
then make trains.

2338
01:42:10,570 --> 01:42:15,570
They would never listened to him if he 
was like a regular person know or even 

2339
01:42:15,570 --> 01:42:19,951
regular genius.
Like you almost have to be like elon 

2340
01:42:19,951 --> 01:42:19,951
musk.
He's like our.

2341
01:42:19,951 --> 01:42:22,960
It's like a guy and tips.
He's like our guy,

2342
01:42:23,320 --> 01:42:25,300
you know,
elon musk,

2343
01:42:25,301 --> 01:42:29,380
plan for high speed car tunnel,
gets initial approvals from la.

2344
01:42:29,440 --> 01:42:32,470
I would like to see the documentary 
about the presentation.

2345
01:42:32,560 --> 01:42:37,560
I'd like to see what happens when the 
earthquake kits and that thing fills up 

2346
01:42:37,560 --> 01:42:38,920
with water rushing towards you and 
you're on that scooter.

2347
01:42:39,140 --> 01:42:44,140
God damn.
Two point seven mile proof of concept 

2348
01:42:44,140 --> 01:42:44,140
puddle along alongside polenta.

2349
01:42:45,940 --> 01:42:48,860
Damn.
Zero missions.

2350
01:42:48,970 --> 01:42:53,970
High speed underground alternative means
of transit for personal vehicles and 

2351
01:42:53,970 --> 01:42:58,351
slash or single rider use according to 
urbanize which reported on the approval 

2352
01:42:59,050 --> 01:43:00,520
man.
I mean,

2353
01:43:00,521 --> 01:43:01,060
what,
what,

2354
01:43:01,270 --> 01:43:04,390
what motivates a guy like that to do so 
many different things.

2355
01:43:04,391 --> 01:43:05,890
That's what's so confusing.
It's,

2356
01:43:05,891 --> 01:43:06,670
it's,
it's,

2357
01:43:06,671 --> 01:43:09,490
um,
it really is that real curious.

2358
01:43:09,550 --> 01:43:11,780
He's an engineer at heart and it's that.
See,

2359
01:43:11,980 --> 01:43:13,910
I think it's the curiosity and,
uh,

2360
01:43:13,930 --> 01:43:18,930
of,
of the challenge and accomplishing 

2361
01:43:18,930 --> 01:43:21,250
something that hasn't been done before 
and I want to make it possible.

2362
01:43:21,430 --> 01:43:22,750
I feel like that has to be the real 
drive.

2363
01:43:22,751 --> 01:43:25,100
It can't be the money and the,
the,

2364
01:43:25,120 --> 01:43:30,120
the stardom of it.
I feel like he really gets off on how 

2365
01:43:30,120 --> 01:43:30,760
can I find a solution to this thing?
Yeah,

2366
01:43:30,761 --> 01:43:32,860
well they're all technologically based 
things.

2367
01:43:33,160 --> 01:43:35,960
Everything he's doing is like tesla,
the tesla,

2368
01:43:36,250 --> 01:43:38,470
those home units,
the tiles,

2369
01:43:38,500 --> 01:43:42,850
the solar tiles that he's putting on 
people's roofs and also it all ties into

2370
01:43:42,970 --> 01:43:45,030
better for humanity.
Yeah.

2371
01:43:45,230 --> 01:43:46,720
Yeah.
It was amazing.

2372
01:43:47,050 --> 01:43:47,550
Yeah,
he's an,

2373
01:43:47,620 --> 01:43:49,780
he's an incredibly lucky that we got a 
guy like that.

2374
01:43:49,781 --> 01:43:52,310
I mean he's,
he's essentially like our version

2375
01:43:52,310 --> 01:43:57,310
of a tesla.
Nikola tesla guy just keeps coming up 

2376
01:43:57,310 --> 01:44:01,430
with new crazier shit to just.
It's amazing.

2377
01:44:01,820 --> 01:44:04,040
there's only one of those guys though.
That's crazy.

2378
01:44:04,460 --> 01:44:09,460
Of course.
The other ones like you would think 

2379
01:44:09,460 --> 01:44:09,460
there'd be a bunch of those kind of guys
now he's.

2380
01:44:09,550 --> 01:44:11,810
Yeah.
What if he wasn't born?

2381
01:44:13,130 --> 01:44:15,690
You know what I mean?
Like when,

2382
01:44:15,860 --> 01:44:18,440
when you have a guy who's that much of 
an outlier,

2383
01:44:19,060 --> 01:44:22,310
it's just so it's so strange because 
you're forced to consider like how,

2384
01:44:22,390 --> 01:44:24,800
how is kind of creePy and a nation of 
300,

2385
01:44:24,801 --> 01:44:28,310
20 million people,
that one individual be such an outlier,

2386
01:44:28,970 --> 01:44:33,970
but even I would even outside of that,
there's not even someone like really 

2387
01:44:33,970 --> 01:44:34,650
liked him somewhere else.
So it's really like,

2388
01:44:34,930 --> 01:44:36,800
no,
like 7 billion people.

2389
01:44:36,900 --> 01:44:37,730
Yeah.
Yeah.

2390
01:44:37,731 --> 01:44:42,731
Who is,
who is the one person that you think of 

2391
01:44:42,731 --> 01:44:45,250
when it comes to technological 
innovation and and producing crazy new 

2392
01:44:45,250 --> 01:44:49,070
inventions and using them to the public 
of jobs like that.

2393
01:44:49,070 --> 01:44:51,100
Right.
I mean it Was sorta,

2394
01:44:51,310 --> 01:44:56,310
sorta.
He didn't do it the way that this guy 

2395
01:44:56,310 --> 01:44:57,881
does know.
He was just within my company is new 

2396
01:44:57,881 --> 01:44:57,881
shit you're going to want.
Yeah.

2397
01:44:57,950 --> 01:45:00,460
That was really him.
It's crazy.

2398
01:45:00,461 --> 01:45:05,461
You see so much.
So many people talking shit about apple 

2399
01:45:05,461 --> 01:45:05,461
lately,
but their laptops,

2400
01:45:05,461 --> 01:45:09,020
people are just tired of.
I'm tired of the lack of innovation.

2401
01:45:09,021 --> 01:45:13,370
It's just all the same thing.
All the mac books look the same but by a

2402
01:45:13,371 --> 01:45:18,371
windows laptop you by infinite variety,
bunch of different types and styles and 

2403
01:45:18,371 --> 01:45:22,700
macbook air.
Thirteen inch or 15 inch macbook pro was

2404
01:45:22,730 --> 01:45:25,830
considered kind of a dud I think,
and I know that sucks.

2405
01:45:25,870 --> 01:45:30,870
Home pod didn't sell well.
They thought that it was going to be a 

2406
01:45:30,870 --> 01:45:33,221
big thing.
Well that's the thing where it's like 

2407
01:45:33,221 --> 01:45:35,320
you only have so much momentum.
That's by jobs and then the new guy tim 

2408
01:45:35,361 --> 01:45:40,361
cook has to takeover and he's got to 
figure out a way to keep that thing 

2409
01:45:40,361 --> 01:45:42,590
rolling and it's just,
he's not the same guy.

2410
01:45:42,820 --> 01:45:44,640
it seems like way healthier.
Right,

2411
01:45:45,340 --> 01:45:46,430
right.
He's not,

2412
01:45:46,431 --> 01:45:47,960
I mean healthier,
not just physically,

2413
01:45:47,961 --> 01:45:49,070
but mentally.
He's not.

2414
01:45:49,130 --> 01:45:50,780
He's not obsessed,
man,

2415
01:45:50,860 --> 01:45:51,800
you know?
Yeah.

2416
01:45:51,980 --> 01:45:53,450
Yeah.
Because jobs was obsessed.

2417
01:45:54,230 --> 01:45:56,480
You need to be obsessed to be that guy.
Yeah.

2418
01:45:57,360 --> 01:46:02,360
I mean,
it's probably one of the things that 

2419
01:46:02,360 --> 01:46:02,360
made them sick.
what was your take on it and you know,

2420
01:46:02,360 --> 01:46:03,110
you've probably already talked about it,
so sorry if you did,

2421
01:46:03,111 --> 01:46:07,100
but uh,
with that whole connor in New York thing

2422
01:46:08,180 --> 01:46:10,730
pretty fucking crazy.
Um,

2423
01:46:11,240 --> 01:46:16,240
there's a whole story behind it.
And the story behind it is that artem 

2424
01:46:16,240 --> 01:46:20,021
low bob,
who is one of connor stablemates,

2425
01:46:21,080 --> 01:46:26,080
had an issue with khabib number go 
madoff because he said something in an 

2426
01:46:26,090 --> 01:46:28,880
interview that could be pulled out of 
fights and the conners,

2427
01:46:28,881 --> 01:46:32,660
the real real fighter,
and then khabib's a coward,

2428
01:46:32,870 --> 01:46:36,290
so could be found him and kind of 
smacked him a little.

2429
01:46:36,440 --> 01:46:39,080
Said you'd call me a coward,
motherfucker like that kind of shit,

2430
01:46:39,530 --> 01:46:41,090
and there's a video of him saying it to 
them,

2431
01:46:41,091 --> 01:46:46,091
talking to them in russian and connor 
saw that video and flew from Ireland 

2432
01:46:47,511 --> 01:46:51,450
with a bunch of fucking gangsters all 
the way to New York to crazy.

2433
01:46:51,510 --> 01:46:56,510
Yeah.
There might've been some substances 

2434
01:46:56,510 --> 01:46:56,510
involved.

2435
01:46:56,790 --> 01:46:57,910
Not good though.
No.

2436
01:46:58,020 --> 01:47:03,020
I mean he might.
He literally might wind up wind up in 

2437
01:47:03,020 --> 01:47:05,031
jail.
It's entirely possible that new york's 

2438
01:47:05,031 --> 01:47:05,031
going to prosecute him.
I mean that was like a salt.

2439
01:47:05,031 --> 01:47:09,620
he threw a dolly at a car.
People get their eyes cut their face 

2440
01:47:09,620 --> 01:47:09,620
cut.
Glass shatter,

2441
01:47:09,620 --> 01:47:09,930
right?
Yeah.

2442
01:47:11,190 --> 01:47:13,020
Yeah.
And luckily it wasn't.

2443
01:47:13,220 --> 01:47:18,220
I mean,
I don't want to Say it any better that 

2444
01:47:18,220 --> 01:47:18,220
men get cut,
but imagine if he did it to rose.

2445
01:47:18,220 --> 01:47:18,220
Nama.
Eunice,

2446
01:47:18,220 --> 01:47:23,210
she's beautiful little 24 year old girl 
who's a world champion would have.

2447
01:47:23,431 --> 01:47:26,070
she got cut by the glass.
What if he ruined her career?

2448
01:47:26,400 --> 01:47:28,620
Like what if she never got to fight 
again with the glass?

2449
01:47:28,621 --> 01:47:33,230
Cut her eye and we lost rose and that 
would've been the day of or day before a

2450
01:47:33,231 --> 01:47:34,430
fight.
Before a fight.

2451
01:47:34,650 --> 01:47:39,650
She,
she thought about pulling out of the 

2452
01:47:39,650 --> 01:47:39,650
fight.

2453
01:47:39,650 --> 01:47:40,590
She was so distraught by the whole event
that she really pulling out.

2454
01:47:40,591 --> 01:47:41,970
Yeah,
because she was on that bus.

2455
01:47:42,030 --> 01:47:43,220
Yeah.
Yeah,

2456
01:47:45,610 --> 01:47:47,130
yeah.
definitely not going to get them.

2457
01:47:47,131 --> 01:47:50,520
I guess I don't know it,
but then in a way it does.

2458
01:47:50,670 --> 01:47:52,320
I know there's people who are talking 
about,

2459
01:47:52,350 --> 01:47:57,350
oh,
this is all coordinated planned like 

2460
01:47:57,350 --> 01:47:57,350
teams on your rent press thing.
Yeah.

2461
01:47:57,350 --> 01:47:59,880
I mean you can definitely see how,
how it could be.

2462
01:47:59,970 --> 01:48:01,080
It's not.
It doesn't,

2463
01:48:01,230 --> 01:48:02,130
but I mean,
yeah,

2464
01:48:02,810 --> 01:48:04,880
it's just not.
But it.

2465
01:48:04,881 --> 01:48:06,840
It's not gonna is it gonna lower his 
draw.

2466
01:48:06,930 --> 01:48:10,110
Probably gonna.
He's gonna be even bigger than ever.

2467
01:48:10,111 --> 01:48:12,810
That's what I'm saying.
So when he actually does fight khabib,

2468
01:48:13,220 --> 01:48:16,110
if those to do fight,
if let's say,

2469
01:48:17,890 --> 01:48:21,760
let's say they solve everything civilly,
meaning connor pays everybody off,

2470
01:48:21,850 --> 01:48:25,660
pays off,
pays ray borg off.

2471
01:48:25,930 --> 01:48:29,530
Pays off emotional duress to anyone who 
sues him.

2472
01:48:29,531 --> 01:48:34,531
That was on the bus.
PaY some sort of a fine to the state of 

2473
01:48:34,531 --> 01:48:35,590
New York.
That'S pretty significant.

2474
01:48:35,890 --> 01:48:38,050
Gives up a few million dollars for sure.
Right?

2475
01:48:38,470 --> 01:48:43,470
Then they put the fight together.
It's going to be giant.

2476
01:48:44,250 --> 01:48:46,060
It's going to be giant.
Maybe that would be the rule.

2477
01:48:47,530 --> 01:48:51,220
Conor mcgregor's comeback fight as 
already being mooted as.

2478
01:48:51,520 --> 01:48:55,180
What does that mean as the biggest 
record breaker in ufc history?

2479
01:48:55,181 --> 01:48:56,720
I've never seen that word.
Mu did.

2480
01:48:58,120 --> 01:48:59,920
Have you ever seen it?
I think it means touted it,

2481
01:48:59,921 --> 01:49:04,921
but never seen it either.
The biggest record breaker in ufc 

2482
01:49:04,921 --> 01:49:04,921
history.
Yeah.

2483
01:49:04,921 --> 01:49:05,980
I will be.
If he fights khabib.

2484
01:49:07,210 --> 01:49:12,210
Experts are predicting.
He'll be back in the octagon within a 

2485
01:49:12,210 --> 01:49:12,210
year.
Okay.

2486
01:49:12,210 --> 01:49:14,200
I'd say a year from now,
that's not a like a much of a stretch.

2487
01:49:15,710 --> 01:49:17,790
That's a crazy prediction of six to 12 
months to.

2488
01:49:17,791 --> 01:49:22,040
I just saw and maybe 81,000
seat stadium in moscow.

2489
01:49:22,490 --> 01:49:23,880
That's what they're gonna do 
potentially.

2490
01:49:23,900 --> 01:49:27,410
I mean it's not signed obviously,
but that's what this article is going to

2491
01:49:27,411 --> 01:49:30,410
be right here.
Watching right here,

2492
01:49:30,430 --> 01:49:33,350
watching that shit on that tv.
It's going to be awesome.

2493
01:49:33,560 --> 01:49:35,990
We're going to be in american on 
american soil drinking,

2494
01:49:36,020 --> 01:49:38,660
budweiser,
drinking american beer.

2495
01:49:39,800 --> 01:49:42,020
Maybe some sam adams,
so I'm american.

2496
01:49:42,440 --> 01:49:44,510
I'm not going to.
Russia not going.

2497
01:49:44,570 --> 01:49:46,980
Come to me and Russia cut to you in 
Russia.

2498
01:49:47,230 --> 01:49:49,360
Got to,
you mean the ufc?

2499
01:49:49,390 --> 01:49:50,980
They sit down and get me excited about 
it.

2500
01:49:52,490 --> 01:49:54,400
And how many hours is the flight?
Shit?

2501
01:49:54,730 --> 01:49:56,050
It's a long flight.
Yeah.

2502
01:49:57,570 --> 01:49:58,020
Yeah.

2503
01:49:58,850 --> 01:50:00,680
It just seems like a.
do a show there?

2504
01:50:00,860 --> 01:50:02,660
Nope.
No,

2505
01:50:02,661 --> 01:50:04,090
I really want to stay here.
Really?

2506
01:50:04,240 --> 01:50:04,750
Yeah.
I don't,

2507
01:50:04,751 --> 01:50:05,970
I don't.
The,

2508
01:50:05,980 --> 01:50:08,900
the beat up that you get from 
international travel.

2509
01:50:09,020 --> 01:50:14,020
Yeah.
It's not worth it and quite honestly I 

2510
01:50:14,020 --> 01:50:17,981
like doing fight companions as much or 
more than I like actually being at the 

2511
01:50:18,651 --> 01:50:19,240
fights.
Really?

2512
01:50:19,370 --> 01:50:21,080
Oh yeah.
It's the most fun ever.

2513
01:50:22,290 --> 01:50:27,290
when me and brendan and eddie and brian 
get together and just talk shit and get 

2514
01:50:27,290 --> 01:50:30,200
high and start drinking wine and just 
getting silly.

2515
01:50:30,290 --> 01:50:32,810
Sometimes we barely comment on the 
fights.

2516
01:50:32,870 --> 01:50:35,240
It's just like being silly.
he's having a good time.

2517
01:50:35,590 --> 01:50:40,450
Eddie have some new conspiracy theory 
about whatever and eddie will go off and

2518
01:50:40,460 --> 01:50:43,880
want to hear that new dinosaurs not 
being real or there's always something.

2519
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:47,140
I mean he just never gives up.
He loves him the fuck.

2520
01:50:48,320 --> 01:50:53,320
I mean,
he left and then every now and then 

2521
01:50:53,320 --> 01:50:53,320
there's something that comes out that 
sort of confirms it.

2522
01:50:53,320 --> 01:50:57,780
Like,
did you see that sinclair broadcasting 

2523
01:50:57,780 --> 01:50:57,780
network compilation?
Yes.

2524
01:50:57,780 --> 01:50:59,930
Which shows all the different anchors,
same exact same thing,

2525
01:50:59,931 --> 01:51:00,680
and you realize,
oh,

2526
01:51:00,681 --> 01:51:03,080
they were given a script all across the 
country.

2527
01:51:03,081 --> 01:51:07,370
All these local news places.
We're giving a script to try to chastise

2528
01:51:07,430 --> 01:51:10,160
fake news and say we have to be careful 
about fake news.

2529
01:51:10,280 --> 01:51:11,330
Yeah.
Yeah.

2530
01:51:11,331 --> 01:51:12,920
It's fascinating.
It's weird.

2531
01:51:13,080 --> 01:51:14,960
[inaudible] and they're growing.
They're growing.

2532
01:51:14,961 --> 01:51:16,830
Sinclair's growing a lot.
Yeah,

2533
01:51:16,940 --> 01:51:19,760
they have.
There's know studies show to that.

2534
01:51:20,360 --> 01:51:25,360
I guess one of the biggest opinion 
formers still a that people kind of 

2535
01:51:26,031 --> 01:51:29,180
write off because it's not as sexy and 
big as local news.

2536
01:51:29,390 --> 01:51:32,650
Local news is huge at at forming 
opinions,

2537
01:51:32,651 --> 01:51:33,750
which I believe it.
Yeah,

2538
01:51:33,980 --> 01:51:35,730
I believe it.
It's.

2539
01:51:35,850 --> 01:51:40,850
It's so fascinating to me.
And then this facebook thing is 

2540
01:51:40,850 --> 01:51:44,231
fascinating to me too,
because we were talking about facebook 

2541
01:51:44,231 --> 01:51:44,450
yesterday that what we were watching 
this,

2542
01:51:45,130 --> 01:51:47,300
you know,
when he was being grilled zuckerberg.

2543
01:51:47,330 --> 01:51:52,330
Yeah.
One of the things they were talking 

2544
01:51:52,330 --> 01:51:52,330
about his upcoming elections 
internationally.

2545
01:51:52,330 --> 01:51:52,520
He's talking about how facebook has 
really,

2546
01:51:52,790 --> 01:51:57,790
you know,
we have to concentrate and all these 

2547
01:51:57,790 --> 01:51:58,820
upcoming elections and make sure there's
no bad actors that are like what?

2548
01:51:58,880 --> 01:52:02,720
Like facebook is involved in shaping the
world.

2549
01:52:02,750 --> 01:52:04,090
It'S incredible.
Yeah.

2550
01:52:04,580 --> 01:52:05,030
I,
you see,

2551
01:52:05,031 --> 01:52:10,031
I saw an article about how they said 
that these senators that grilled him 

2552
01:52:10,760 --> 01:52:13,580
miss so many things,
basically because they're old,

2553
01:52:13,850 --> 01:52:18,850
they're just like,
they didn't ask so many questions 

2554
01:52:18,850 --> 01:52:19,730
because they don't understand how 
facebook works.

2555
01:52:20,180 --> 01:52:22,610
There's a funny video that I put up,
jamie,

2556
01:52:22,730 --> 01:52:27,730
you find it,
it's on twitter of some of the more 

2557
01:52:27,730 --> 01:52:31,511
hilarious things that came out of that 
interaction and one of them was the guy 

2558
01:52:31,641 --> 01:52:36,641
asks a zuckerberg,
would you tell us the hotel you're 

2559
01:52:36,641 --> 01:52:38,540
staying at?
He's like,

2560
01:52:38,570 --> 01:52:39,640
no,
like,

2561
01:52:39,690 --> 01:52:44,150
would you be willing to tell us and show
us all the messages,

2562
01:52:44,600 --> 01:52:47,660
all the that you've sent?
And he's like,

2563
01:52:47,720 --> 01:52:48,590
no,
like,

2564
01:52:48,620 --> 01:52:49,220
listen to this.

2565
01:52:49,500 --> 01:52:50,180
I'Ll get to that part,

2566
01:52:56,860 --> 01:52:57,470
those,
this,

2567
01:52:58,380 --> 01:52:58,920
uh,

2568
01:52:59,130 --> 01:53:00,620
back up,
back it up.

2569
01:53:00,640 --> 01:53:04,120
That's nine fertilizer or campaign,
uh,

2570
01:53:04,210 --> 01:53:05,420
who,
who asks for it?

2571
01:53:05,830 --> 01:53:08,740
Mr zuckerberg,
would you be comfortable sharing with us

2572
01:53:08,741 --> 01:53:10,480
the name of the hotel you stayed in last
night?

2573
01:53:15,550 --> 01:53:17,530
Uh,
no.

2574
01:53:20,090 --> 01:53:24,470
If you've messaged anybody this week,
would you share with us the names of the

2575
01:53:24,471 --> 01:53:25,340
people you've messaged?

2576
01:53:26,670 --> 01:53:27,290
Senator?
No,

2577
01:53:27,291 --> 01:53:29,870
I would probably not choose to do that 
publicly here.

2578
01:53:30,160 --> 01:53:30,410
I think

2579
01:53:30,660 --> 01:53:32,250
maybe what this is all about,

2580
01:53:32,870 --> 01:53:34,850
here's what everybody's been trying to 
tell you.

2581
01:53:34,851 --> 01:53:35,570
That,
and I,

2582
01:53:35,690 --> 01:53:40,690
I say this gently,
your user agreement shocks.

2583
01:53:44,120 --> 01:53:49,120
I'm going to suggest to you that you go 
back home and rewrite it until you're 

2584
01:53:49,550 --> 01:53:51,190
$1,200
an hour lawyers.

2585
01:53:51,200 --> 01:53:52,970
No disrespect,
they're good,

2586
01:53:53,840 --> 01:53:58,840
but,
but tell hIm you want it written in 

2587
01:53:58,840 --> 01:54:00,941
english and swahili so the average 
american can understand that would be a 

2588
01:54:02,691 --> 01:54:04,600
start quite a story,
right?

2589
01:54:08,540 --> 01:54:10,520
There's no competition.
That's what's really weird.

2590
01:54:10,720 --> 01:54:12,200
Yeah.
Like as far as like,

2591
01:54:12,260 --> 01:54:13,790
there's twitter.
Yeah,

2592
01:54:13,820 --> 01:54:18,820
that is just,
it's cool that we have these three 

2593
01:54:18,820 --> 01:54:18,820
different ones too,
which is really fascinating.

2594
01:54:19,640 --> 01:54:22,130
You got twitter,
which is just some text,

2595
01:54:22,340 --> 01:54:25,790
like I saw this article,
check it out and then people retweet it.

2596
01:54:25,791 --> 01:54:27,770
I liked that aspect of the product.
And then,

2597
01:54:27,771 --> 01:54:29,840
you know,
you could state your opinion on things,

2598
01:54:29,841 --> 01:54:34,250
you could clarify things,
but then there is instagram,

2599
01:54:34,280 --> 01:54:35,620
just photos,
hey,

2600
01:54:35,750 --> 01:54:39,700
this is my time in Peru,
look at the beautiful buildings.

2601
01:54:39,701 --> 01:54:41,180
They own that one,
that's not a competitor.

2602
01:54:41,210 --> 01:54:43,260
Right.
But I mean the three different things.

2603
01:54:43,990 --> 01:54:48,990
And then there's facebook,
which is like a lot of arguments in 

2604
01:54:48,990 --> 01:54:50,260
discussions,
deep discussion,

2605
01:54:50,300 --> 01:54:53,120
politics.
That's like the big one when it comes to

2606
01:54:53,121 --> 01:54:55,640
like deep political discussions.

2607
01:54:57,420 --> 01:55:02,420
It's a wonder what is coming next 
because these we typically people try to

2608
01:55:02,890 --> 01:55:05,020
my goals,
I know you're right.

2609
01:55:05,021 --> 01:55:07,090
But I feel like,
I don't know,

2610
01:55:07,150 --> 01:55:09,010
they have a,
they have a pretty strong grip.

2611
01:55:09,011 --> 01:55:09,460
I mean,
you know,

2612
01:55:09,461 --> 01:55:14,461
snapchat is really popular,
but as soon as snapchat looked like it 

2613
01:55:14,461 --> 01:55:19,081
was about to just really explode an 
meaning that it would be the kind of 

2614
01:55:19,210 --> 01:55:21,100
premier,
you know,

2615
01:55:21,160 --> 01:55:23,680
a visual one.
Instagram was like,

2616
01:55:23,681 --> 01:55:26,470
we're going to add that that same,
uh,

2617
01:55:26,740 --> 01:55:31,740
aspect to instagram,
instagram stories just squashed that 

2618
01:55:31,740 --> 01:55:33,730
squashed.
Instagram's a better platform.

2619
01:55:34,570 --> 01:55:39,570
But it's just really interesting to see 
like what we choose to put our time and 

2620
01:55:39,570 --> 01:55:42,910
our energy and where it's going.
And when Is the first virtual reality or

2621
01:55:42,930 --> 01:55:47,930
augmented reality,
social network going to what's got to be

2622
01:55:48,660 --> 01:55:53,660
around the corner?
They must be scrambling to be the first 

2623
01:55:53,660 --> 01:55:53,660
to come up with it.

2624
01:55:53,660 --> 01:55:56,400
Because if you can like if you tried,
there was a thing called views.

2625
01:55:56,401 --> 01:55:58,470
There still is a Thing called views.
I got on it.

2626
01:55:58,471 --> 01:56:03,471
I told them once people get on it,
I haven't even opened it and fucking 

2627
01:56:03,471 --> 01:56:07,401
month if you put a cup v use,
I put a couple pictures up and then I 

2628
01:56:07,401 --> 01:56:08,700
was like,
I gave up.

2629
01:56:08,701 --> 01:56:12,330
I mean I signed up for it but I can't do
another one right now.

2630
01:56:12,450 --> 01:56:16,840
I just can't see.
I don't even know what it's called.

2631
01:56:16,841 --> 01:56:18,420
The,
I forgot his fucking name.

2632
01:56:18,810 --> 01:56:21,790
Nobody's on that goddamn thing.
But it was also confusing,

2633
01:56:21,791 --> 01:56:24,630
like no one could comment on my pictures
and less like accepted them.

2634
01:56:24,900 --> 01:56:27,630
And then I looked at thirtY 5,000
people to accept.

2635
01:56:27,631 --> 01:56:29,460
I'm not doing that.
I gotta do one by one.

2636
01:56:29,520 --> 01:56:31,260
I don't know.
It seemed like it.

2637
01:56:31,860 --> 01:56:34,800
Put them in groups.
Oh come all the way off.

2638
01:56:34,800 --> 01:56:38,100
Fuck off with that gap all the way.
Fuck outta here wIth that.

2639
01:56:38,120 --> 01:56:40,500
Am I going to do that?
How am I going to do that with 35,000

2640
01:56:40,501 --> 01:56:42,150
people?
IT might even be more than that now.

2641
01:56:42,330 --> 01:56:44,580
I don't even know how many I have now.
tell me how many I have.

2642
01:56:44,850 --> 01:56:47,790
I haven't been there in forever.
I don't even know the name of it.

2643
01:56:48,180 --> 01:56:53,180
Kona views veered so far off.
Google views.

2644
01:56:55,620 --> 01:56:57,960
It's hard to figure out how to look to.
What's Your.

2645
01:56:58,020 --> 01:57:03,020
Have a favorite one?
You have a favorite platform or like 

2646
01:57:03,020 --> 01:57:04,440
instagram added to it seems to be the,
the most.

2647
01:57:04,441 --> 01:57:05,980
Uh,
It's the,

2648
01:57:06,200 --> 01:57:08,850
it's the most flexible.
You can put text up,

2649
01:57:08,851 --> 01:57:11,880
you can put an image of text,
you can put a video up.

2650
01:57:12,090 --> 01:57:12,930
It's great.
You know,

2651
01:57:13,050 --> 01:57:18,050
I think it's the most flexible.
You're fucking instagram makes me 

2652
01:57:18,050 --> 01:57:18,420
hungry.
Yeah.

2653
01:57:18,670 --> 01:57:19,410
Do you cook?

2654
01:57:19,860 --> 01:57:22,830
I do not got some milk.
I just got some new sausages.

2655
01:57:23,100 --> 01:57:24,640
It's very easy.
Easy to cook.

2656
01:57:24,960 --> 01:57:26,340
Elk sausage.
I have some.

2657
01:57:26,400 --> 01:57:28,120
Oh yeah.
Tommy?

2658
01:57:28,240 --> 01:57:29,280
Yes.
Fuck yeah,

2659
01:57:29,340 --> 01:57:30,360
there's some here.
Yes,

2660
01:57:30,361 --> 01:57:31,130
I do.
Oh,

2661
01:57:31,140 --> 01:57:33,240
can I take some reserve?
Oh shit.

2662
01:57:33,300 --> 01:57:34,120
Oh,
it does hurt stocks.

2663
01:57:34,121 --> 01:57:35,820
Doxil I.
This is a good year.

2664
01:57:36,060 --> 01:57:38,230
Good year for the rogan meet.
Collecting from.

2665
01:57:38,800 --> 01:57:40,500
Yeah.
I got to elk this year,

2666
01:57:40,501 --> 01:57:45,501
so that's like 800 pounds of meat.
I've already given away a couple of 

2667
01:57:45,501 --> 01:57:45,501
hundred pounds.
Really?

2668
01:57:45,501 --> 01:57:45,960
Yeah,
I'd give it away for everybody.

2669
01:57:46,110 --> 01:57:47,160
That's awesome.
I love it.

2670
01:57:47,640 --> 01:57:49,270
I feel like I'm a provider.
Yeah,

2671
01:57:49,280 --> 01:57:52,260
you are like give it to people and then 
they send me pictures of food.

2672
01:57:52,261 --> 01:57:52,920
They cooked.
I'm like,

2673
01:57:53,370 --> 01:57:55,470
you're the village elder man.
You're fucking.

2674
01:57:55,890 --> 01:57:58,560
Duncan sent me a picture of these 
meatballs and he made with the elk,

2675
01:57:58,561 --> 01:57:59,670
with the ground elk.
I waS like,

2676
01:57:59,700 --> 01:58:01,020
oh my god,
that looks so good.

2677
01:58:01,020 --> 01:58:02,430
That was crazy.
Duncan obviously.

2678
01:58:02,431 --> 01:58:03,840
Very good.
I saw him last night.

2679
01:58:03,890 --> 01:58:04,590
Yeah,
last night.

2680
01:58:04,591 --> 01:58:05,430
He's here.
Yeah,

2681
01:58:05,431 --> 01:58:06,810
he's back.
He's back.

2682
01:58:06,870 --> 01:58:09,120
move back.
He's great man.

2683
01:58:09,210 --> 01:58:11,280
He's such a good dude.
He is a sweetheart.

2684
01:58:11,430 --> 01:58:12,930
We did brooklyn together.
Me,

2685
01:58:12,931 --> 01:58:15,400
him and ari.
Oh really?

2686
01:58:15,401 --> 01:58:16,860
I didn't.
Yeah,

2687
01:58:16,920 --> 01:58:18,030
it was fun,
man.

2688
01:58:18,270 --> 01:58:20,860
And then we went to peter luger's.
I saw the Peter Lynch.

2689
01:58:21,490 --> 01:58:23,550
Oh fuck.
Yeah.

2690
01:58:23,580 --> 01:58:24,540
You know,
they put those.

2691
01:58:24,630 --> 01:58:29,160
I think it's the second part of it.
They have like a process there that they

2692
01:58:29,161 --> 01:58:34,161
put in at 1200 degree broiler,
so like that's why it pops.

2693
01:58:34,850 --> 01:58:36,390
This shits that.
By the way,

2694
01:58:36,391 --> 01:58:38,700
I think obviously peter luger does it 
right.

2695
01:58:39,240 --> 01:58:42,010
To me it's one of the only.
I'm not somebody that

2696
01:58:42,010 --> 01:58:43,450
complains at restaurants.

2697
01:58:44,200 --> 01:58:45,120
Yeah,
come on.

2698
01:58:47,680 --> 01:58:51,540
Yeah,
I was camp.

2699
01:58:53,240 --> 01:58:56,440
It was a beautiful.
Those are beautiful.

2700
01:58:56,740 --> 01:58:58,570
You don't get that over a plate of 
carrots.

2701
01:58:58,690 --> 01:59:00,270
I don't.
I like fuck it.

2702
01:59:00,270 --> 01:59:00,540
I can

2703
01:59:00,810 --> 01:59:05,420
meet piping hot.
I can't do luke warm,

2704
01:59:05,600 --> 01:59:06,930
you know,
it's like I'll,

2705
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:09,120
I'll tell them,
can you make it hotter?

2706
01:59:09,121 --> 01:59:10,380
And they're like,
you want hot sauce?

2707
01:59:10,420 --> 01:59:10,830
And I'm like,
no,

2708
01:59:10,840 --> 01:59:11,070
no,
no.

2709
01:59:11,290 --> 01:59:14,790
And you put it back on fire so that it's
hot when I eat it.

2710
01:59:16,080 --> 01:59:18,180
That's the only way you like it.
I like meat.

2711
01:59:18,240 --> 01:59:19,890
I like it.
Particularly steak,

2712
01:59:20,550 --> 01:59:22,590
like temperature wise,
very high.

2713
01:59:22,610 --> 01:59:27,610
I don't like it cooked through,
but I liked it like on a hot plate or 

2714
01:59:27,610 --> 01:59:31,431
just like off the grill in my mouth.
That's interesting because some people 

2715
01:59:31,431 --> 01:59:32,970
think that you should let it rest.
I know letting it rest before you.

2716
01:59:32,971 --> 01:59:33,520
I mean,
you know,

2717
01:59:33,540 --> 01:59:38,540
taking,
letting them eat rest before you grill 

2718
01:59:38,540 --> 01:59:38,540
it and.
No,

2719
01:59:38,540 --> 01:59:38,540
no.
Letting it rest after your grill.

2720
01:59:38,540 --> 01:59:40,670
It supposed to let it rest for 10 
minutes now.

2721
01:59:40,671 --> 01:59:42,600
Fuck that.
No way.

2722
01:59:43,370 --> 01:59:43,660
No.

2723
01:59:46,110 --> 01:59:47,670
Yeah,
there's all sorts of weird rules.

2724
01:59:47,690 --> 01:59:49,620
What you're supposed to do and not 
supposed to do with meat.

2725
01:59:50,190 --> 01:59:52,860
I watched the whole steg documentary.
Which one?

2726
01:59:52,960 --> 01:59:57,960
I think it might be called steak or was 
it just followed like all over the 

2727
01:59:59,251 --> 02:00:04,251
world.
Different people who either are chefs or

2728
02:00:04,620 --> 02:00:06,990
raise cattle and,
and you know,

2729
02:00:07,230 --> 02:00:10,020
theories on how to make that.
This might be it here.

2730
02:00:10,830 --> 02:00:11,520
Yeah.
This is it.

2731
02:00:11,580 --> 02:00:12,960
I watched this.
Is it good?

2732
02:00:13,500 --> 02:00:18,500
It was a production wise is a little 
[inaudible] but we will do shit 

2733
02:00:18,500 --> 02:00:18,500
different ways.
Yeah,

2734
02:00:18,500 --> 02:00:18,770
I mean,
but it's,

2735
02:00:18,830 --> 02:00:23,830
it's entertaining and you know,
seeing how they make it different in 

2736
02:00:23,830 --> 02:00:27,411
different parts of the world was cool.
You could go down a rabbit hole when it 

2737
02:00:27,411 --> 02:00:27,870
comes to food preparation.
Oh yeah.

2738
02:00:27,920 --> 02:00:29,370
You know,
like anthony bourdain show,

2739
02:00:29,371 --> 02:00:34,371
no reservations got me into it and now 
his new show parts unknown is fucking 

2740
02:00:36,121 --> 02:00:36,900
amazing for that.

2741
02:00:36,930 --> 02:00:41,930
Yeah.
Just traveling everywhere and eating 

2742
02:00:41,930 --> 02:00:41,930
exotic food everywhere.
It's great.

2743
02:00:41,930 --> 02:00:43,060
I love bordain.
You know,

2744
02:00:43,080 --> 02:00:44,550
he's all skinny now.
Have you seen him?

2745
02:00:44,640 --> 02:00:46,200
Yeah,
he looks carves out.

2746
02:00:46,290 --> 02:00:48,060
Did he cut out the booze?
Cut out the car.

2747
02:00:48,070 --> 02:00:51,630
He has that naturally thin frame to 
never was really like a big,

2748
02:00:51,631 --> 02:00:53,610
big guy.
Now he does jujitsu every day.

2749
02:00:53,670 --> 02:00:57,440
He's shredded to izzy.
It's got a six pack full on six pack.

2750
02:00:57,450 --> 02:00:58,830
He used to have a pot belly.
Good for you,

2751
02:00:58,831 --> 02:00:59,760
ant?
Yeah,

2752
02:01:00,480 --> 02:01:03,290
that's nice man.
Pimping pimping.

2753
02:01:03,320 --> 02:01:08,320
He used to like,
used to have like a pot belly just 

2754
02:01:08,320 --> 02:01:10,821
eating.
He told me that he got on statens which 

2755
02:01:10,821 --> 02:01:12,090
are um,
those uh,

2756
02:01:12,240 --> 02:01:13,830
cholesterol blockers,
you know,

2757
02:01:14,520 --> 02:01:18,150
he got on those instead of not,
instead of changing his diet,

2758
02:01:18,330 --> 02:01:19,080
just like,
fuck it,

2759
02:01:19,081 --> 02:01:21,350
I'm just gonna get on the statens.
I'm just gonna keep you may.

2760
02:01:21,410 --> 02:01:22,830
His whole show was just.
I mean,

2761
02:01:22,890 --> 02:01:27,890
I'd like to,
for him to do an episode just on 

2762
02:01:27,890 --> 02:01:29,451
diarrhea and where he's headed and what 
the worst one was because I'm sure he's 

2763
02:01:29,451 --> 02:01:33,291
got some epic stories.
Almost shit my pants last night at the 

2764
02:01:33,291 --> 02:01:33,291
improv.
Really?

2765
02:01:33,291 --> 02:01:33,291
Yup.
I came so close,

2766
02:01:33,300 --> 02:01:36,000
same in my car,
I'm on my way to the improv.

2767
02:01:36,001 --> 02:01:39,030
I was coming over the hill and I was on 
laurel and I was like,

2768
02:01:39,080 --> 02:01:40,140
oh my god,
I'm

2769
02:01:40,160 --> 02:01:45,160
several miles away and I'm not going to 
make it real and I was going to try to 

2770
02:01:45,160 --> 02:01:48,110
get into the mcdonald's on sunset and 
take a shit there.

2771
02:01:48,290 --> 02:01:50,210
And I was like,
if I just get into that mcdonald,

2772
02:01:50,211 --> 02:01:55,211
but then I'm like,
I'm gonna have to buy something because 

2773
02:01:55,211 --> 02:01:55,211
this is all a lot of homeless people in 
that area.

2774
02:01:55,211 --> 02:01:57,260
You can't just use the bathroom,
you have to be a customer.

2775
02:01:57,690 --> 02:01:59,810
I kind of have the time and I'm like,
I'm just going to keep it together.

2776
02:01:59,930 --> 02:02:04,930
And it was just sweating,
willpower alone that I didn't shit 

2777
02:02:04,930 --> 02:02:05,990
myself.
It was an internal wrestling.

2778
02:02:05,991 --> 02:02:10,991
Did you park in front or did you parked 
right in front and I ran into the 

2779
02:02:10,991 --> 02:02:14,900
bathroom and I got to the toilet,
got my pants down,

2780
02:02:15,170 --> 02:02:19,360
put my butt and then my shit so hard.
I lifted like,

2781
02:02:19,370 --> 02:02:24,370
yeah,
it's like one of those jet things with 

2782
02:02:24,370 --> 02:02:25,610
the dudes and the ocean and the water.

2783
02:02:25,610 --> 02:02:28,040
The jets like got him up in the air,
a jet pack,

2784
02:02:28,070 --> 02:02:32,000
like drag racing when the foot hit the 
gas money cars front.

2785
02:02:33,410 --> 02:02:35,750
Oh,
I barely made it and I miss my spot.

2786
02:02:36,050 --> 02:02:37,610
Were you scared someone was going to be 
on the toilet?

2787
02:02:37,611 --> 02:02:40,070
Did mr highspot?
Yeah,

2788
02:02:40,071 --> 02:02:42,530
nikki glaser.
I'd take my spot when I went after.

2789
02:02:42,620 --> 02:02:45,920
What did beforehand?
Nothing unusual.

2790
02:02:45,970 --> 02:02:47,870
It's just,
it didn't make any sense.

2791
02:02:48,230 --> 02:02:50,900
I don't know what it was.
I don't know what got me,

2792
02:02:50,960 --> 02:02:53,390
but something got me and it got and it 
was like,

2793
02:02:54,150 --> 02:02:56,840
it was like on the way,
on the way over the hill.

2794
02:02:56,841 --> 02:02:58,070
I was like,
oh no,

2795
02:02:58,120 --> 02:03:00,010
like I'm not gonna make it.
And I was,

2796
02:03:00,040 --> 02:03:00,540
I was,
you know,

2797
02:03:00,590 --> 02:03:02,990
you start thinking of different places 
you could pull over to shit.

2798
02:03:03,230 --> 02:03:05,180
Like maybe if I just jumped in this 
guy's bushes,

2799
02:03:05,510 --> 02:03:07,910
like maybe I was trying to think of 
places where I could.

2800
02:03:07,911 --> 02:03:10,600
Shit.
That's how bad acadian.

2801
02:03:11,220 --> 02:03:13,020
Yeah,
on laurel worse.

2802
02:03:15,300 --> 02:03:18,830
I was thinking of pulling over on a side
street and just shitting in some bushes.

2803
02:03:20,710 --> 02:03:25,710
It's just the cleanup it because 
yesterday I'm thinking now because I 

2804
02:03:25,710 --> 02:03:28,790
know now I know this is a possibility.
I didn't shit myself,

2805
02:03:28,940 --> 02:03:33,940
but I came close close.
I need an extra pair of underwear and 

2806
02:03:33,940 --> 02:03:33,940
pants in my car at all times.
Yeah.

2807
02:03:33,940 --> 02:03:36,590
It's a small package.
Pair of pants or underwear.

2808
02:03:36,830 --> 02:03:40,610
Maybe not totally paper to maybe.
Maybe it goes,

2809
02:03:40,700 --> 02:03:45,700
goes low.
Where was callin going when he said he 

2810
02:03:45,700 --> 02:03:45,700
shit himself?
Didn't.

2811
02:03:46,190 --> 02:03:48,740
He didn't.
He said he did and then he showed up and

2812
02:03:48,741 --> 02:03:49,250
I'm like,
what happened?

2813
02:03:49,251 --> 02:03:49,640
Oh,
it changed.

2814
02:03:49,641 --> 02:03:50,520
My parents were like,
what?

2815
02:03:50,810 --> 02:03:53,180
You just changed your payment?
Changes their pants.

2816
02:03:53,210 --> 02:03:55,010
Just change your pants.
Do you just pull it?

2817
02:03:55,020 --> 02:03:56,380
Where'd you change your pants?
Where?

2818
02:03:56,490 --> 02:03:59,720
Where'd you go with your shitty pants?
Did you go to a gas station?

2819
02:03:59,750 --> 02:04:01,520
What the fuck are you talking about,
calvin?

2820
02:04:01,720 --> 02:04:02,180
Yeah.
No,

2821
02:04:02,580 --> 02:04:04,460
he was supposed to be doing a spot at 
the ice house.

2822
02:04:04,470 --> 02:04:08,450
That god can't make it a shit mY pants.
Like your people waiting for you here.

2823
02:04:08,480 --> 02:04:11,060
Get over here.
Twenty minutes later he's there.

2824
02:04:11,390 --> 02:04:13,220
No shit.
Fresh pAnts,

2825
02:04:13,670 --> 02:04:16,730
son of a bitch.
I hate shooting at clubs.

2826
02:04:17,340 --> 02:04:19,130
You got to do what you gotta do though.
Of course.

2827
02:04:19,131 --> 02:04:20,570
I know I'm saying that.
I mean I've done it.

2828
02:04:20,710 --> 02:04:25,710
Yeah.
He shouldn't have planes too and I 

2829
02:04:25,710 --> 02:04:25,710
fucking sometimes god dammit.
Yeah.

2830
02:04:25,710 --> 02:04:30,250
Planes are the worst when you go in 
there after someone shit and all that 

2831
02:04:30,250 --> 02:04:32,800
smear as over the log smear over the 
inside of that bowl.

2832
02:04:32,801 --> 02:04:36,830
That's a very ineffective way of 
containing odor and cleaning the.

2833
02:04:37,290 --> 02:04:38,160
I've seen it.
I've

2834
02:04:38,160 --> 02:04:40,920
walked into a plane bathroom like get.
Oh my god.

2835
02:04:41,940 --> 02:04:46,560
You lift up the seat and it's stuck to 
the side and put like a chunk.

2836
02:04:46,620 --> 02:04:47,340
Oh,
log.

2837
02:04:47,370 --> 02:04:52,370
Yeah.
And then you hit flush and you see the 

2838
02:04:52,370 --> 02:04:52,370
water go over it.
Just like not moving it at all.

2839
02:04:52,370 --> 02:04:54,600
You got to pee on it and knock it loose 
and sometimes you don't even have enough

2840
02:04:54,601 --> 02:04:56,270
strength for that.
I've,

2841
02:04:56,470 --> 02:05:01,470
I've told the flight attendants and 
someone really dropped a crazy shit in 

2842
02:05:01,470 --> 02:05:04,671
there.
They gave me spray like from their 

2843
02:05:04,671 --> 02:05:05,720
personal,
like go spray that in there myself.

2844
02:05:05,790 --> 02:05:07,590
It's not going to shake it loose off the
side.

2845
02:05:07,591 --> 02:05:08,550
No,
it's a clear.

2846
02:05:09,110 --> 02:05:11,010
Yeah.
It's intense.

2847
02:05:11,370 --> 02:05:13,610
Intense man.
Yeah.

2848
02:05:13,620 --> 02:05:16,170
Why is,
why is your body have to smell so awful,

2849
02:05:17,180 --> 02:05:20,130
like wouldn't know.
What purpose does that serve,

2850
02:05:20,550 --> 02:05:24,270
I guess to let you know that that is not
something you want to put in your body.

2851
02:05:24,420 --> 02:05:26,100
You don't want to eat that,
you know,

2852
02:05:26,101 --> 02:05:29,130
because otherwise,
like I told you about my dog when he was

2853
02:05:29,131 --> 02:05:30,750
a puppy,
he would eat his shit.

2854
02:05:30,751 --> 02:05:33,210
He wants you to show up so bad that as 
he was shitty,

2855
02:05:33,211 --> 02:05:35,500
he will be turning around and trying to 
bite it out of his apple.

2856
02:05:35,580 --> 02:05:36,930
Oh my god.
Really?

2857
02:05:37,470 --> 02:05:39,600
This little golden retriever.
Wow.

2858
02:05:39,650 --> 02:05:41,940
Was when he was a little baby.
He would do that.

2859
02:05:41,941 --> 02:05:44,160
It was hilarious and disgusting at the 
same time,

2860
02:05:44,340 --> 02:05:45,960
but he'd be like shitting and they'd go,
oh,

2861
02:05:45,961 --> 02:05:48,080
what do we got here?
And then they apparently they,

2862
02:05:48,360 --> 02:05:51,000
they,
they such a common thing with dogs.

2863
02:05:51,300 --> 02:05:53,010
There's something to give them,
you know,

2864
02:05:53,090 --> 02:05:53,790
to,
to keep,

2865
02:05:54,380 --> 02:05:56,190
to make their shit tastes like,
oh,

2866
02:05:56,380 --> 02:05:59,100
it's not a terrible enough on this shit 
isn't.

2867
02:05:59,440 --> 02:05:59,940
And they're like,
no,

2868
02:05:59,941 --> 02:06:01,160
this will really make it bad.
I'm like,

2869
02:06:01,170 --> 02:06:01,770
oh,
okay.

2870
02:06:02,810 --> 02:06:05,490
Yeah.
Some people spray something on the shit.

2871
02:06:06,170 --> 02:06:07,620
I'm like,
why don't you just clean it up?

2872
02:06:07,621 --> 02:06:10,650
You lazy bitch can just claim it.
Hang up the phone.

2873
02:06:10,790 --> 02:06:13,290
I'm just going to spray something.
We'll spray some hot sauce.

2874
02:06:13,310 --> 02:06:14,660
Teach a little fellow.
Wasn't,

2875
02:06:16,770 --> 02:06:21,770
you know,
I watched this thing on spies and they 

2876
02:06:21,770 --> 02:06:21,770
used to,
uh,

2877
02:06:21,770 --> 02:06:25,680
they used to leave notes like,
this is back in the cold war,

2878
02:06:25,681 --> 02:06:30,681
days in dead animals.
And like that would be one way to pass 

2879
02:06:31,111 --> 02:06:36,111
on information,
but those animals would get eaten by 

2880
02:06:36,111 --> 02:06:36,790
other animals because it's dead,
right?

2881
02:06:36,870 --> 02:06:39,880
So then they,
they figured out that nothing.

2882
02:06:39,940 --> 02:06:44,940
No wild animal basically likes tabasco.
So they would douse dead animals with 

2883
02:06:46,381 --> 02:06:48,900
tabasco and have a note.
Wow.

2884
02:06:48,930 --> 02:06:50,670
Tucked into it.
Never get eaten.

2885
02:06:51,240 --> 02:06:53,250
They would smell that and be like,
fuck that.

2886
02:06:53,460 --> 02:06:54,930
Isn't that crazy?
You'd be like,

2887
02:06:55,160 --> 02:06:56,070
hmm.
That was pretty good.

2888
02:06:56,100 --> 02:06:57,150
This might be doable.

2889
02:06:57,150 --> 02:06:59,220
Now,
when I was in new orleans,

2890
02:06:59,221 --> 02:07:03,940
they have hot chicken,
fried chicken dipped in hot sauce.

2891
02:07:03,941 --> 02:07:06,210
Yeah.
I think in nashville has a nashville,

2892
02:07:06,220 --> 02:07:07,620
new orleans,
nashville,

2893
02:07:08,510 --> 02:07:11,460
the nashville hot chicken is confused 
it.

2894
02:07:11,520 --> 02:07:12,410
Yeah,
I confused it.

2895
02:07:12,411 --> 02:07:14,460
It's nashville.
It was fucking amazing.

2896
02:07:14,461 --> 02:07:15,120
Amazing,
right?

2897
02:07:15,210 --> 02:07:16,020
Yeah.
Yeah.

2898
02:07:16,290 --> 02:07:18,510
There's a big one here I think downtown.
Yep.

2899
02:07:18,720 --> 02:07:21,790
What is it not ready?
Just one North Carolina.

2900
02:07:21,860 --> 02:07:24,210
Was that one of those ones?
You have to wait in line all day.

2901
02:07:24,240 --> 02:07:26,130
But that's the nashville one too,
which makes me.

2902
02:07:26,490 --> 02:07:27,390
I'm like,
fuck this,

2903
02:07:27,391 --> 02:07:29,160
I only make a certain amount of day.
Yeah.

2904
02:07:29,161 --> 02:07:30,480
So they don't like,
they're not cooking it all day.

2905
02:07:30,481 --> 02:07:32,960
They make one batch and that's how much 
you get.

2906
02:07:33,090 --> 02:07:35,860
Let that kind of demand for your,
like a made this and they're like,

2907
02:07:35,861 --> 02:07:36,130
we'll

2908
02:07:36,130 --> 02:07:39,190
wait outside in the sun.
Please.

2909
02:07:39,191 --> 02:07:40,780
Can I have some like I'm out,
I'm leaving,

2910
02:07:40,781 --> 02:07:41,800
I'm leaving for the day.
I'll see you.

2911
02:07:41,801 --> 02:07:44,250
The franklins and austin franklin's 
barbecue.

2912
02:07:44,260 --> 02:07:49,260
Famous for that.
They people pay people to wait in line 

2913
02:07:49,260 --> 02:07:49,880
for them and here.
Um,

2914
02:07:49,990 --> 02:07:52,060
I mean I've driven by it.
I mean for years.

2915
02:07:52,240 --> 02:07:53,530
What's it called?
On the brayer.

2916
02:07:53,740 --> 02:07:54,610
Pinks.
Yeah.

2917
02:07:54,611 --> 02:07:58,450
You see that line sometimes you're like,
that's just a regular hot dog to get mad

2918
02:07:58,451 --> 02:07:59,290
once you eat it.
Yeah,

2919
02:07:59,291 --> 02:08:00,820
of course.
I'm a fucking moron.

2920
02:08:01,470 --> 02:08:06,470
And in philly,
almost all the good cheese steak places 

2921
02:08:06,470 --> 02:08:07,300
have a crazy line.
Well there's something about booze.

2922
02:08:07,301 --> 02:08:09,070
And then food that's cooked out in the 
open,

2923
02:08:09,071 --> 02:08:10,150
you're like,
ah,

2924
02:08:10,310 --> 02:08:12,390
that,
that smell fly around the.

2925
02:08:12,520 --> 02:08:16,380
The night air.
Yeah.

2926
02:08:16,830 --> 02:08:20,110
Yeah.
The last time I drank a of substance,

2927
02:08:20,111 --> 02:08:23,050
I think it was in columbus,
and they have a carts,

2928
02:08:23,110 --> 02:08:25,640
street carts guys making,
you know,

2929
02:08:25,780 --> 02:08:27,850
uh,
euros and hot dogs.

2930
02:08:27,850 --> 02:08:30,100
And like,
you have a little booze and you,

2931
02:08:30,170 --> 02:08:31,810
you tear it down and you're like,
that was good.

2932
02:08:31,990 --> 02:08:33,130
Round two,
let's do it.

2933
02:08:33,160 --> 02:08:38,160
And then it's like 10 minutes after you 
eat your second thing when you're 

2934
02:08:38,160 --> 02:08:38,160
drinking,
you're like,

2935
02:08:38,160 --> 02:08:42,810
this was a bad idea.
I should have just stuck to the one we 

2936
02:08:42,810 --> 02:08:46,591
were in columbus once and we went to a 
bar after we did the comedy show and 

2937
02:08:46,960 --> 02:08:51,960
there was a guy in front of the bar that
was selling venison sausage sandwiches 

2938
02:08:52,150 --> 02:08:56,590
with peppers and onions and whole lease 
shit.

2939
02:08:56,591 --> 02:09:01,591
Was it good?
I felt like the first time I'd ever 

2940
02:09:01,591 --> 02:09:02,500
eaten a venison sausage,
but this guy killed the deer himself.

2941
02:09:02,620 --> 02:09:05,860
Was selling venison sausages.
Had a cart and the cart.

2942
02:09:05,890 --> 02:09:08,020
Yeah.
That's the coolest fucking amazing.

2943
02:09:08,470 --> 02:09:12,380
And all kinds of crazy sauces that he 
was putting on him as an artist.

2944
02:09:12,490 --> 02:09:13,180
I think about that.

2945
02:09:13,270 --> 02:09:15,730
That's an artist.
Just I hope one day I walk out.

2946
02:09:15,731 --> 02:09:16,540
There he is.
There he is.

2947
02:09:16,541 --> 02:09:18,820
Yeah.
The venison sausage guy.

2948
02:09:20,510 --> 02:09:22,270
I got some elk sausage for you telling 
me about them.

2949
02:09:22,300 --> 02:09:23,400
I can't wait.
I can't.

2950
02:09:23,820 --> 02:09:25,570
Let's wrap this up because I gotta get 
outta here.

2951
02:09:25,571 --> 02:09:27,370
I gotta drive all the way to fucking 
irvine tonight.

2952
02:09:27,880 --> 02:09:30,610
I was gonna ask you if tom could tell 
you about the cursive little b.

2953
02:09:31,990 --> 02:09:33,010
He knows all about it.
Yeah.

2954
02:09:33,090 --> 02:09:35,800
I think you know more about the curse of
little b.

2955
02:09:35,800 --> 02:09:38,860
Little b.
He really did curse Kevin Duran,

2956
02:09:38,861 --> 02:09:40,750
right?
He did carson and it works.

2957
02:09:40,751 --> 02:09:41,670
Kevin wants.
No,

2958
02:09:41,790 --> 02:09:43,160
no part of that.
Wow.

2959
02:09:43,240 --> 02:09:45,040
I mean,
not even apologize now,

2960
02:09:45,070 --> 02:09:47,950
but kevin switched teams because of the 
curse.

2961
02:09:48,220 --> 02:09:53,220
Who knows?
He said he was never going to win a 

2962
02:09:53,220 --> 02:09:53,220
championship ever again or ever.
Really.

2963
02:09:53,220 --> 02:09:55,630
I think that's what he said.
And then he took the curse off,

2964
02:09:55,631 --> 02:09:56,080
I believe.

2965
02:09:56,110 --> 02:09:56,750
Yeah.
I think you're right.

2966
02:09:56,830 --> 02:10:01,830
These people.
But it didn't occur as harden because 

2967
02:10:01,830 --> 02:10:03,420
took his uh,
then credited from it.

2968
02:10:03,460 --> 02:10:07,180
I believe his wife movement,
I don't know if it was like cooking,

2969
02:10:07,210 --> 02:10:09,840
like I got to eat whatever,
starting food up.

2970
02:10:10,560 --> 02:10:11,490
I'm eating right now.
You're like,

2971
02:10:11,500 --> 02:10:14,050
when you're,
when you're killing it and like that was

2972
02:10:14,051 --> 02:10:17,920
a little bees move so nobody lifted.
It looks like you lift at sea lifts.

2973
02:10:17,921 --> 02:10:19,790
Curse and james harden.
Chris,

2974
02:10:19,840 --> 02:10:22,240
multiple people on twitter.
It's a thing you don't want.

2975
02:10:22,241 --> 02:10:23,690
That's when it happened.
I took,

2976
02:10:23,691 --> 02:10:27,250
I texted you and I was like,
oh see when the thing was when,

2977
02:10:27,310 --> 02:10:31,060
when a guy like that says he's cursing 
and that's what [inaudible] all about.

2978
02:10:31,480 --> 02:10:33,010
It gets in your head.
That's right.

2979
02:10:33,020 --> 02:10:33,830
Mind fucks you.

2980
02:10:34,040 --> 02:10:38,090
What does he dress like?
Dress like that?

2981
02:10:38,091 --> 02:10:40,400
Yes.
He just like a chick with a,

2982
02:10:40,730 --> 02:10:45,730
like an old lady's hat and a dress on.
He's definitely had a wide variety of 

2983
02:10:45,730 --> 02:10:46,880
outfits.
Fascinating.

2984
02:10:47,510 --> 02:10:49,340
Fascinating.
He wants to do a podcast.

2985
02:10:49,610 --> 02:10:50,300
Oh,
you should do it.

2986
02:10:50,340 --> 02:10:50,930
It does.
God,

2987
02:10:51,330 --> 02:10:52,250
he's going to come in.
Base.

2988
02:10:52,251 --> 02:10:53,390
Guys are going to come down here.
Yep.

2989
02:10:53,990 --> 02:10:56,540
We're gonna.
Keep popping feet and face photo.

2990
02:10:56,541 --> 02:10:58,660
Send them in feet and face.
Yeah.

2991
02:10:58,820 --> 02:11:00,020
That's what he wants.
One of his themes.

2992
02:11:00,021 --> 02:11:05,021
Yeah.
He wants girls feet and their face 

2993
02:11:05,021 --> 02:11:05,021
showed me your face too.
I'll be going to show your feet.

2994
02:11:05,021 --> 02:11:06,140
Yeah,
because it can't be busted.

2995
02:11:06,280 --> 02:11:06,860
Well like.
Yeah.

2996
02:11:06,861 --> 02:11:09,680
What if you have a nice fee and your 
face is on the other thing.

2997
02:11:09,681 --> 02:11:10,600
Yeah.
The other way around.

2998
02:11:10,610 --> 02:11:12,860
You keep your socks on if you're hot,
funky feet.

2999
02:11:13,310 --> 02:11:14,930
Right?
No one wants to see that shit.

3000
02:11:15,980 --> 02:11:17,720
He is a serious character though.

3001
02:11:17,750 --> 02:11:18,920
Yeah man.
He's an interesting guy.

3002
02:11:18,921 --> 02:11:22,820
Interesting guy.
He's probably the first guy to come with

3003
02:11:22,821 --> 02:11:25,250
the public curse.
Like who?

3004
02:11:25,370 --> 02:11:27,710
Who else?
Who's publicly curse people,

3005
02:11:27,740 --> 02:11:28,940
I dunno.
And it's worked.

3006
02:11:29,870 --> 02:11:34,870
That's what's crazy is this is bold.
Just to have that in your arsenal of I'm

3007
02:11:35,031 --> 02:11:40,031
saying of of insults or beef,
like to be the first like if somebody 

3008
02:11:40,031 --> 02:11:40,180
was.
Somebody said like,

3009
02:11:40,190 --> 02:11:42,620

this dude was talking shit about you and

3010
02:11:42,621 --> 02:11:43,310
you're like,
that's fine.

3011
02:11:43,340 --> 02:11:48,340
I just cursed that motherfucker.
Like that in and of itself is just 

3012
02:11:48,340 --> 02:11:48,340
terrifying.
Yeah.

3013
02:11:48,440 --> 02:11:50,060
Especially if it works.
Confident move,

3014
02:11:50,090 --> 02:11:52,550
man.
I want to say that the base,

3015
02:11:52,551 --> 02:11:57,551

under are free now to win future games.

3016
02:11:58,220 --> 02:12:01,280
You can't win hating.

3017

02:12:03,600 --> 02:12:04,880

Okay,

3019
02:12:04,881 --> 02:12:07,140
so he took that off awhile ago.
I didn't realize it was that.

3020
02:12:07,640 --> 02:12:09,050
I remember when it happened.
I was like,

3021
02:12:09,110 --> 02:12:10,460
ooh,

3022
