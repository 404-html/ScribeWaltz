1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:03,570
The general experience.
So,

2
00:00:03,571 --> 00:00:04,141
um,
yeah,

3
00:00:04,141 --> 00:00:07,170
so mma,
who named it mixed martial arts,

4
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:11,190
you know what that's a look at.
That's a whole story.

5
00:00:11,191 --> 00:00:13,800
And you're going to hear it was you.
Well,

6
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:18,780
I give credit to Jeff Blatnick as far as
looking at.

7
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:21,300
Oh,
he didn't come up with the term who did?

8
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:23,680
But the truth,
you know,

9
00:00:23,681 --> 00:00:25,320
and this is the first thing I can tell
you,

10
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,870
I wrote,
I wrote a,

11
00:00:27,871 --> 00:00:30,840
uh,
I had to do what's called a work permit

12
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:36,290
for lapd because I worked for lapd back
in 1993 93 in [inaudible] 94.

13
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:44,570
And it was because I was going to
referee the second UFC which was March

14
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,450
11th of 1994.
And for me to actually work,

15
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,740
the department has to allow me to,
I have to ask for permission and then

16
00:00:52,741 --> 00:00:56,160
they have to grant that permission.
Was there a concern that it was too

17
00:00:56,161 --> 00:00:57,000
outrageous?

18
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:00,450
That was part of the whole thing is I
didn't want to say,

19
00:01:00,451 --> 00:01:02,040
oh,
I got two guys going into a cage.

20
00:01:02,041 --> 00:01:03,510
They're going to beat the shit out of
each other.

21
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:06,610
Right.
So the first thing I put was martial

22
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:08,280
arts referee.
Hm,

23
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:09,480
okay.
And then they said,

24
00:01:09,481 --> 00:01:10,860
well,
what kind of martial arts?

25
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:16,040
So I wrote mixed martial arts referee,
now I can tell you that that was in 90,

26
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,020
right at the end of [inaudible] 93.
And the term I didn't get it from

27
00:01:22,021 --> 00:01:24,470
anywhere other than I'm sitting there
trying to think it.

28
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,940
But I do know that there was a
columnist,

29
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:31,970
a sports writer from the La Times that
wrote about the very first UFC and in

30
00:01:33,991 --> 00:01:37,030
his article wrote mixed martial arts.
Ah,

31
00:01:37,031 --> 00:01:38,160
so maybe it was him.
So I.

32
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,350
well you got John Perretti saying that
he's,

33
00:01:40,351 --> 00:01:43,080
you know,
he did it back in 1983 and it's like,

34
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,690
okay,
well if no one's saying it,

35
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:47,010
it doesn't mean shit.

36
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,313
Right.
Okay.

37
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:52,050
So the truth of the matter is,
so already might have said it in 83,

38
00:01:52,051 --> 00:01:55,170
he might have said it,
but it didn't mean anything because the

39
00:01:55,171 --> 00:01:57,870
fact of the matter is,
and it doesn't matter what I wrote,

40
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,890
what matters is when you know,
when you joined,

41
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:06,420
when you joined the UFC,
it was still considered no holds barred

42
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:09,690
NHB yeah.
And it was what we called it and it was

43
00:02:09,691 --> 00:02:12,960
something that was,
and this is probably part of my problem

44
00:02:12,961 --> 00:02:16,510
with Campbell Mclaren is back before UFC
two,

45
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:17,720
you know,
good.

46
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:21,420
They had them on Good Morning America
with Jim Brown and you go back to that

47
00:02:21,421 --> 00:02:25,080
and he came up with the line that you
could win by knockout,

48
00:02:25,081 --> 00:02:27,730
tap out or death.
Okay.

49
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:34,220
And for years after that I was in court
having that thrown in my face by the

50
00:02:35,851 --> 00:02:39,360
fricken attorney trying to put us down
saying,

51
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:41,340
isn't this what you're companies?

52
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:42,620
No,
that's not what my son says.

53
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:44,940
That's what an idiot said.
Yeah.

54
00:02:44,941 --> 00:02:48,030
Okay.
And so he still to this day things,

55
00:02:48,031 --> 00:02:52,020
he was magnificent with that.
Maybe it was kind of demonic ceremony.

56
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,870
Maybe it wouldn't be a problem at all.
Here's the deal.

57
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:58,500
It's all one thing getting fucked up.
Shamonic,

58
00:02:58,501 --> 00:03:00,160
whatever.
If you in drugs and you fucked up,

59
00:03:00,161 --> 00:03:03,460
you fucked up.
Doesn't matter if it's shamonic or not.

60
00:03:03,461 --> 00:03:07,030
If you.
If you get high and that tweaks,

61
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:09,700
that little thing in my brain that goes
on here.

62
00:03:09,701 --> 00:03:11,710
I go.
Remember in your brain,

63
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:16,420
I got high for 30 years.
I'm from the sixties with the best of

64
00:03:16,421 --> 00:03:19,750
them.
I got high and it took them down.

65
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:21,310
Some of them,
most of them.

66
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:24,520
You came through it remarkably unscathed
if you think about it.

67
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:25,870
Yeah.
Thank you God.

68
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,100
It's pretty amazing.
Thank you God.

69
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:29,913
Thank you God.

70
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:32,440
Think about that one.
Yeah.

71
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,150
Think about that.
We could talk for two hours.

72
00:03:34,151 --> 00:03:37,210
About Times I did shit and almost died.
So.

73
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:38,530
Sure.
You know,

74
00:03:38,531 --> 00:03:43,531
and then I could also tell you
how many times I took shit and wrote

75
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:47,890
things like,
you know,

76
00:03:47,891 --> 00:03:50,200
I'm listening to this guitar lick that
chose plan.

77
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:54,010
He did an interview here with you,
but he didn't tell you how it his

78
00:03:54,011 --> 00:03:57,070
fucking sleep.
He would play these riffs and I come

79
00:03:57,071 --> 00:03:58,620
down the hallway because,
you know,

80
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:01,890
as I see it,
of course not as ace it,

81
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:05,080
but as I see it,
we were up in New England and he was

82
00:04:05,081 --> 00:04:07,430
playing at a place and I mowed the lawn,
my,

83
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:08,530
my,
my,

84
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:13,530
my parents place and I quit my last band
and I was fucking a little who saw her.

85
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,960
I was crying.
I was no more bands.

86
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:20,950
The dream was over.
He drives up in an mg we go and he's

87
00:04:20,951 --> 00:04:21,784
playing that night.

88
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:27,030
I swear to God this happened and so we
decided to move down to Boston,

89
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:32,590
but all in an apartment because I
thought I knew why those bands didn't

90
00:04:32,591 --> 00:04:36,400
make it,
but I knew in my heart that if I had a

91
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:38,980
broan band,
like I'm making a keith.

92
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,850
Like the kinks.
Yeah.

93
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:41,730
David,
Dave,

94
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:45,210
and you know ray,
any of those bands they had,

95
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:46,063
they had,
you know,

96
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:48,760
have.
It was two guys that were really tight.

97
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,650
They feed off each other.
The Fed off each other.

98
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:53,110
Exactly.
So we moved down there.

99
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:55,780
I got really tight with Joe.
I hear him.

100
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:57,720
He gets,
we get so swept.

101
00:04:57,770 --> 00:05:02,770
We were so stoned on blue boone's farm.
I mean fucking.

102
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:07,150
I said,
what'd you say?

103
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:08,440
What'd you say?
Anyway,

104
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:11,920
but he would play these licks.
It was so fucking for every song you've

105
00:05:11,921 --> 00:05:13,600
ever heard.
Sweet emotion.

106
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:19,230
Every one of those legs walk this way.
There's 20 that got lost in the ether,

107
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:22,720
right?
Twenty that got lost in the ether.

108
00:05:22,721 --> 00:05:25,360
So I went out and bought a little thing
on the tape recorder back then.

109
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:27,450
Remember this was 71.
You know,

110
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:30,520
a lot of shit wasn't no phones,
no cell phones.

111
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:33,880
So I would record that shit.
So anyway,

112
00:05:33,881 --> 00:05:35,020
what we're going with this,
that's,

113
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,390
that's what,
that's where these songs came from and

114
00:05:37,391 --> 00:05:42,390
stuff would come out of my head while I
was like sweet

115
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:46,060
white,
Ypo.

116
00:05:46,061 --> 00:05:46,894
Fuck.
Get me paper,

117
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,810
paper and pen.
I write that shit down suddenly.

118
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:51,700
Whoops.
On the radio.

119
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,850
See?
So I used that place.

120
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:57,220
You get you go to,
when you eat edibles,

121
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:02,210
do you ever write some of your routines
when you know for sure?

122
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:06,830
Well and also check this out.
The best part of it is when I got sober,

123
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:11,630
I started writing even better shit.
I go in a room with four guys and say,

124
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:15,200
we're going into right ahead.
We're going to say in this fucking room

125
00:06:15,201 --> 00:06:18,110
until we do or until we can't stay in
each of the smell

126
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:24,670
and we would leave in seven hours with a
fucking song and a good one and one that

127
00:06:25,881 --> 00:06:27,320
would live way past all of us.

128
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:30,660
Check that shooter,
but that's a lot of damage out.

129
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:35,910
What can be done is the ideas can die.
The ideas of of fascism,

130
00:06:35,911 --> 00:06:37,950
the ideas of racism,
the,

131
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:38,610
the,
those,

132
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:43,380
those things we can kill,
but are those ideas,

133
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:47,680
are those ideas being fostered in these,
in these communities?

134
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:48,990
Yes.
Yeah.

135
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:52,260
They're being cultivated.
Yeah,

136
00:06:52,261 --> 00:06:53,940
because you experienced it.
Yeah.

137
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:55,890
Yeah.
I mean if I'm a white guy,

138
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:58,110
white guy walking down the street,
I am.

139
00:06:58,111 --> 00:07:02,340
I am a higher degree than the locals.
You know,

140
00:07:02,341 --> 00:07:04,830
like I can.
I can go and shop in some places that

141
00:07:04,831 --> 00:07:07,590
they can't.
I can go in and sit down and have a meal

142
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:10,800
in some places that they can't.
I can and being greeted on the street.

143
00:07:10,801 --> 00:07:11,900
Good Morgan,
you know,

144
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:14,580
I'm not,
not the brown dude next to me.

145
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:18,060
He's not.
And His kid definitely can't date the

146
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,480
blue eyed blonde girl at the high
school.

147
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:24,720
That's not allowed.
So they'll basically created these

148
00:07:24,721 --> 00:07:26,770
little colonies.
Yeah.

149
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:31,000
Yahtzee colonies in South America.
Did you Google Google Colonia dignity

150
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:31,990
data?
Yeah.

151
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:33,580
Did you?
You will have nightmares.

152
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:35,720
Do not freak it out right now.
It's diverse.

153
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:39,300
It's crazy how many people got away with
it that Joseph Mengele died on a beach.

154
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:42,320
That's Lillian wife.
I mean that,

155
00:07:42,321 --> 00:07:42,741
that,
that,

156
00:07:42,741 --> 00:07:45,900
that would hurt me because he's a guy
like me just on the ops because he,

157
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:47,340
I mean,
he's a special operations guy.

158
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:48,550
He was an ss.
Um,

159
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:49,170
he,
he was,

160
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:51,510
he was a physical specimen,
especially for the time,

161
00:07:51,511 --> 00:07:52,030
you know,
like we didn't,

162
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:53,310
we didn't understand.
I mean,

163
00:07:53,311 --> 00:07:57,390
he was,
he was very early on into the,

164
00:07:58,110 --> 00:07:59,790
one of the first real Nazis,
like,

165
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:02,730
this isn't okay.
All of Germany's going this way.

166
00:08:02,731 --> 00:08:06,810
The chancellor is Adolf Hitler.
This is where we're going.

167
00:08:06,811 --> 00:08:11,060
I kind of just have to go along and you
see some of that in the third year,

168
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:14,220
like 43,
44 now it's okay.

169
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:16,660
We might be losing this war now.
It's not so in vogue,

170
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:22,130
but when you got guys like 1939 that are
talking to eugenics and um,

171
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:28,110
you know,
higher calling for breeding and

172
00:08:28,111 --> 00:08:29,800
segregation.
Um,

173
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,680
early on you're like,
Eh,

174
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:36,210
I don't like that guy.
Kona beat him to death with my hands,

175
00:08:36,211 --> 00:08:38,010
but he's massive.
So it'd be a pretty good fight.

176
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:43,040
It was a,
there we go form Nazi cult.

177
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:43,950
Trying to.
What does it say?

178
00:08:43,951 --> 00:08:45,360
Jimmy was the full,
uh,

179
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:48,210
full Nazi Colt.
What is the uh,

180
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:49,011
so that,
that,

181
00:08:49,011 --> 00:08:51,810
that's just a marketing thing because
it's still the same place.

182
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,990
Reformed Nazi,
cult trying to open it's colony to.

183
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:57,300
And is this,
that's in Chile?

184
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:00,030
Yeah.
I spent a lot of time.

185
00:09:00,031 --> 00:09:03,990
They're right there.
How they made a movie about it.

186
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:08,450
So that's current day right there.
Jesus Christ.

187
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:12,560
That later hose in range is freaking
gorgeous though.

188
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,310
It's,
I mean it is Shangri la.

189
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,700
Yeah,
German flag flying.

190
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:19,330
Wow.
They've tried to hide the Nazi things

191
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,770
they've had.
I've met some people that I'm like,

192
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:22,610
I talked to him.
I go,

193
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:23,690
oh,
I'm like a monkey

194
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:28,820
dude.
I talked to your Buddy Eddie Bravo,

195
00:09:28,821 --> 00:09:31,400
and that guy is a real.
He's out there.

196
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:34,190
He's like a.
he's like a deaf deaf Jack Russell

197
00:09:34,191 --> 00:09:35,020
almost,
you know,

198
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:37,310
a deaf Jack Russell,
because once he gets going,

199
00:09:37,311 --> 00:09:37,941
you can't.
Oh,

200
00:09:37,941 --> 00:09:39,060
Jack Russell terrier?
Yeah.

201
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:41,330
You ever been around with the dog?
You open the car and then next thing you

202
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:42,164
know they're like,
oh yeah,

203
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:43,550
they're like sick.
Yeah,

204
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:45,980
but how's he depth?
Because you can't get them back.

205
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:50,300
Like once he goes,
you can't say you can't get them back in

206
00:09:50,301 --> 00:09:53,570
the car.
Like you're sitting there honking the

207
00:09:53,571 --> 00:09:56,120
horn.
You can't that guys out there,

208
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:57,950
you know my home.
You know what I'm talking about.

209
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:01,390
Two totally talking about,
but I've never heard anybody make a

210
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:04,790
description like that.
Jack Russell terrier.

211
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:07,130
That is hilarious.
Extravagant dude.

212
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,500
That means extravagant.
He's motivated.

213
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:13,610
He loves conspiracies more than anybody
I've ever met in my life.

214
00:10:13,611 --> 00:10:15,140
And he thinks everything is a
conspiracy.

215
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:16,171
Yeah.
No,

216
00:10:16,171 --> 00:10:16,780
no,
he definitely.

217
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:19,100
Yeah,
but then he gets into it like,

218
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,680
I dunno,
it was fascinating to me how he went

219
00:10:21,681 --> 00:10:25,370
from this like one genre of life to the
next and created a business in each one

220
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:27,440
and kept moving forward.
A business.

221
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:28,251
Yeah.
He got like,

222
00:10:28,251 --> 00:10:29,510
he was a,
he liked music.

223
00:10:29,511 --> 00:10:31,070
He started a band,
you know,

224
00:10:31,071 --> 00:10:33,590
he liked karate.
He started doing,

225
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,450
um,
you know,

226
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,400
organized karate.
He liked,

227
00:10:37,401 --> 00:10:38,730
uh,
you know,

228
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,910
what else did he pee?
A couple of other businesses.

229
00:10:40,911 --> 00:10:42,440
I think you got a new couple of other
things.

230
00:10:42,441 --> 00:10:45,930
I don't know what the other two.
He lost the,

231
00:10:45,931 --> 00:10:46,940
uh,
chapter 70.

232
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:49,340
But he'll hit you with too much
information.

233
00:10:49,341 --> 00:10:50,270
Man.
It was crazy.

234
00:10:50,271 --> 00:10:51,950
A lot of people to Google.
I was like,

235
00:10:51,951 --> 00:10:55,910
I want to climb through a black hole
right now into a case he did shit.

236
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:56,571
Like,
wait a minute,

237
00:10:56,571 --> 00:10:57,590
is this guy legit?
Dude?

238
00:10:57,591 --> 00:11:00,200
The other night 2:00 AM,
he sends me a couple of links.

239
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,810
You got to shut your phone off friends
with Eddie.
