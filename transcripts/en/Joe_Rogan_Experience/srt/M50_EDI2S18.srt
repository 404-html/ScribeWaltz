1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:03,570
The joe rogan experience.
So,

2
00:00:03,571 --> 00:00:04,141
um,
yeah,

3
00:00:04,141 --> 00:00:07,170
so mma,
who named it mixed martial arts.

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:08,800
You know what?
That's it.

5
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:11,190
Look it.
That's a whole story.

6
00:00:11,191 --> 00:00:12,960
And you're going to hear,
I heard it was you.

7
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:14,123
Well,
I,

8
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:18,780
I give credit to Jeff Blatnick as far as
looking at,

9
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:21,330
ah,
he didn't come up with the term who did,

10
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:25,170
but the truth,
and this is the first thing I can tell

11
00:00:25,171 --> 00:00:26,220
you,
I wrote,

12
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:28,190
I wrote a,
uh,

13
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:32,880
I had to do it what's called a work
permit for lapd because I worked for

14
00:00:32,881 --> 00:00:37,560
lapd back in 1993,
93,

15
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:41,550
[inaudible] 94.
And it was because I was going to

16
00:00:41,551 --> 00:00:45,420
referee the second UFC,
which was March 11th,

17
00:00:45,421 --> 00:00:48,450
in 1994.
And for me to actually work,

18
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:52,740
the department has to allow me to,
I have to ask for permission and then

19
00:00:52,741 --> 00:00:56,160
they have to grant that permission.
Was there a concern that it was too

20
00:00:56,161 --> 00:00:56,940
outrageous?

21
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:00,450
So that was part of the whole thing is I
didn't want to say,

22
00:01:00,451 --> 00:01:02,040
oh,
I got two guys going into a cage.

23
00:01:02,041 --> 00:01:03,510
They're going to beat the shit out of
each other.

24
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:07,380
So the first thing I put was a martial
arts referee.

25
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,650
Hmm,
okay.

26
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:09,600
And then they said,
well,

27
00:01:09,601 --> 00:01:13,740
what kind of martial arts?
So I wrote mixed martial arts referee.

28
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:19,550
Now I can tell you that that was in 90
right at the end of [inaudible] 93 a

29
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:23,490
term.
I didn't get it from anywhere other than

30
00:01:23,491 --> 00:01:26,100
I'm sitting there trying to think of,
but I do know that there was a

31
00:01:26,101 --> 00:01:30,330
columnist,
a sports writer from the La Times that

32
00:01:30,331 --> 00:01:35,331
wrote about the very first UFC,
and in his article wrote mixed martial

33
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:37,020
arts.
Ah,

34
00:01:37,021 --> 00:01:38,150
so maybe it was him.
So,

35
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,080
well,
you've got John Perretti saying that

36
00:01:40,081 --> 00:01:40,770
he's,
you know,

37
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:44,160
he did it back in 1983 it's like,
okay,

38
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:47,010
well if no one's saying it,
it doesn't mean shit.

39
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:48,253
Right.
Okay.

40
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,700
So the truth of the matter is,
so peretti might have said it in

41
00:01:51,701 --> 00:01:55,140
[inaudible] 83 he might've said it,
but it didn't mean anything because the

42
00:01:55,141 --> 00:01:57,870
fact of the matter is,
and it doesn't matter what I wrote,

43
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,820
what matters is when,
you know,

44
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,570
when you joined it,
when you joined the UFC,

45
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:07,260
it was still considered no holds barred.
NHB.

46
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,660
Yeah,
he was what we called and it was

47
00:02:09,661 --> 00:02:11,250
something that was,
and this is,

48
00:02:11,251 --> 00:02:13,110
you know,
probably part of my problem with

49
00:02:13,111 --> 00:02:16,620
Campbell Mclaren is back at you before
ufc too,

50
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:17,773
you know,
good.

51
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:21,420
They had them on Good Morning America
with Jim Brown and you go back to that

52
00:02:21,421 --> 00:02:25,070
and he came up with the line that you
could win by knockout,

53
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,840
tap out or death.
Okay.

54
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:34,220
And four years after that,
I was in court having that thrown in my

55
00:02:34,711 --> 00:02:39,360
face by the fricking attorneys trying to
put us down saying,

56
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,580
isn't this what your company's,
no,

57
00:02:41,581 --> 00:02:43,260
that's not what my cock fighting.

58
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:45,390
That's what an idiot said.
Okay.

59
00:02:45,391 --> 00:02:49,350
And so he still to this day thinks he
was magnificent with that.

60
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:50,140
Maybe,
you know,

61
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:53,520
it was kind of a shamanic ceremony.
Maybe it wouldn't be a problem at all.

62
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:57,960
Here's the deal.
It's all one thing getting fucked up.

63
00:02:57,961 --> 00:03:00,190
Shamonic whatever.
If you taking drugs and you fucked up,

64
00:03:00,191 --> 00:03:03,160
you fucked up.
It doesn't matter if it's shamonic or

65
00:03:03,161 --> 00:03:03,651
not.
If you,

66
00:03:03,651 --> 00:03:07,030
if you get high and,
and that and the tweaks,

67
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:09,700
that little thing in my brain that goes
here,

68
00:03:09,701 --> 00:03:11,690
I go,
remember in your brain,

69
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:13,200
I got high for 30 years,
right.

70
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:18,800
I'm from the 60s with the best of them.
I got high and it took them down.

71
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:21,310
Some of them,
most of them.

72
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:24,520
You came through it remarkably unscathed
if you think about it.

73
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:25,870
Yeah.
Thank you God.

74
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:28,180
It's pretty amazing.
Thank you God.

75
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:32,110
Thank you God.
Think about that one.

76
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:32,980
Yeah.
Think about that.

77
00:03:32,981 --> 00:03:36,490
We could talk for two hours about times
I did shit and almost died.

78
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:38,530
So sure.
You know,

79
00:03:38,531 --> 00:03:41,700
and then I could also tell you,
um,

80
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:46,690
how many times I took shit and wrote
things like,

81
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:49,540
you know,
I'm listening to this guitar lick that

82
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:51,520
Joe's playing.
He did an interview here with you,

83
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:55,930
but he didn't tell you how it is.
Fucking sleepy would play these rifts.

84
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:59,590
And I come down the hallway because as I
see it,

85
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:03,670
of course not as ac it,
but as I see it,

86
00:04:03,671 --> 00:04:07,210
we were up in New England and he was
playing at a place and I mowed the lawn,

87
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,250
my,
my,

88
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:09,460
my,
my parents place.

89
00:04:09,461 --> 00:04:14,170
And I quit my last band and I was
fucking a Lou who saw her.

90
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,990
I was crying,
I was no more bands.

91
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:19,990
The dream was over.
He drives up in an mg,

92
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:21,730
we go and he's playing that night.

93
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:27,030
I swear to God this happened.
And so we decided to move down to

94
00:04:27,101 --> 00:04:29,950
Boston,
but all in an apartment because I

95
00:04:29,951 --> 00:04:33,010
thought I knew why those bands didn't
make it.

96
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:37,180
But I knew in my heart did,
if I had a borrowed a band,

97
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:40,330
like a mic and a keith,
like the kinks,

98
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:41,780
David,
Dave,

99
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:43,060
and you know,
ray,

100
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:45,550
any of those bands they have,
they have,

101
00:04:45,551 --> 00:04:47,140
you know,
have,

102
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:49,660
it was two guys that were really tight.
They feed off each other.

103
00:04:49,661 --> 00:04:51,400
The Fed off each other.
Exactly.

104
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:55,070
So we moved down there.
I got really tight with Joe [inaudible].

105
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,440
I hear him.
He'd get,

106
00:04:56,441 --> 00:05:00,100
we'd get so swept.
We were so stoned on booze,

107
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:04,210
boone's farm,
you know when we fucking her,

108
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:07,150
I said,
what'd you say?

109
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,440
What'd you say?
Anyway,

110
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:11,890
but he would play these licks.
It was so fucking for every song you've

111
00:05:11,891 --> 00:05:13,600
ever heard.
Sweet emotion.

112
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:19,200
Every one of those lex walk this way.
There's 20 that got lost in the ether,

113
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:22,150
right?
20th ago.

114
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:24,210
Lawson ether.
So I went out and bought a little thing

115
00:05:24,211 --> 00:05:27,720
called the tape recorder back then.
Remember this was 71 you know it's a lot

116
00:05:27,721 --> 00:05:29,740
of shit.
Wasn't no phones,

117
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:33,340
no cell phones.
So I would record that shit.

118
00:05:33,341 --> 00:05:34,750
And so anyway,
what were we going with this?

119
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:35,890
That's,
that's what,

120
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:39,700
that's what these songs came from and
stuff would come out of my head while I

121
00:05:39,701 --> 00:05:44,701
was like sweet [inaudible] low tion
wait,

122
00:05:45,911 --> 00:05:46,391
Whoa,
fuck,

123
00:05:46,391 --> 00:05:49,810
get me paid paper and pen.
I write that shit down suddenly.

124
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,700
Whoops.
On the radio.

125
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:56,140
So I use that place you get,
you go to,

126
00:05:56,141 --> 00:05:58,690
when you eat edibles,
do you have a ride?

127
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:01,320
So many routines when you in animals.
Well there you go.

128
00:06:01,321 --> 00:06:01,701
Yeah,
no,

129
00:06:01,701 --> 00:06:04,070
for sure.
Well and also check this out.

130
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:08,080
The best part of it is when I got sober,
I started right.

131
00:06:08,081 --> 00:06:11,630
Even even better shit.
I go in a room with four guys and say

132
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:15,230
we're going into right ahead.
We're going to say in his fucking room

133
00:06:15,231 --> 00:06:18,110
until we do or until we can't stand each
other smell.

134
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:24,700
And we would leave in seven hours with a
fucking song and a good one and one that

135
00:06:25,851 --> 00:06:27,320
would live way past all of us.

136
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:30,300
Check that shit out.
But that's a lot of damage.

137
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:35,090
What can be done is the ideas can die.
The ideas of,

138
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:37,680
of fascism,
the ideas of racism,

139
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:38,550
the,
those,

140
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,260
those things we can kill.
Right.

141
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:43,410
Um,
but are those ideas,

142
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:47,670
are those ideas being fostered and these
in these communities?

143
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:49,010
Yes.
Yeah.

144
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:52,230
They're being cultivated.
Yeah.

145
00:06:52,231 --> 00:06:53,910
Cause it's like you experienced it.
Yeah.

146
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:55,890
Yeah.
I mean if I'm a white guy,

147
00:06:55,891 --> 00:06:58,080
white guy walking down the street,
I am,

148
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:02,340
I am a higher degree than the locals.
You know,

149
00:07:02,341 --> 00:07:04,830
like I can,
I can go and shop in some places that

150
00:07:04,831 --> 00:07:06,890
they can't.
I can go in and sit down and,

151
00:07:06,891 --> 00:07:09,000
and have a meal in some places that they
can't.

152
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:11,490
I cannot be greeted on the street and
good Morgan,

153
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:12,710
you know,
um,

154
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,580
not,
not the brown dude next to me.

155
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:18,090
He's not.
And His kid definitely can't date the

156
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,480
blue eyed blonde girl at the high
school.

157
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:24,930
That's not allowed.
So they basically created these little

158
00:07:24,931 --> 00:07:26,730
colonies.
Yeah.

159
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:31,000
Yahtzee colonies in South America.
Did you Google Google cloney digging?

160
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:32,310
Yeah.
Did you,

161
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:33,860
you will have nightmares.
She did.

162
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,630
I'm freaking out right now.
It's years.

163
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:39,300
It's crazy how many people got away with
it that Joseph Mengele died on a beach.

164
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:42,280
That's [inaudible] wife.
I mean that,

165
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:42,741
that,
that,

166
00:07:42,741 --> 00:07:45,900
that would hurts me cause he's a guy
like me just on the ops cause he,

167
00:07:45,901 --> 00:07:48,120
and he's a special operations guy.
He was an ss.

168
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:48,801
Um,
he's,

169
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:50,610
he was,
he was a physical specimen,

170
00:07:50,611 --> 00:07:51,660
especially for the time,
you know,

171
00:07:51,661 --> 00:07:53,570
like we didn't understand.
I mean he was,

172
00:07:53,571 --> 00:07:57,370
uh,
he was a very early on into the,

173
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:00,780
one of the first real Nazis.
Like this isn't okay.

174
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:05,250
All of Germany's going this way.
The chancellor is Adolf Hitler.

175
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:09,270
This is where we're going.
I kind of just have to go along and you

176
00:08:09,271 --> 00:08:11,880
see some of that in the third and
they're like 43,

177
00:08:11,881 --> 00:08:12,840
44.

178
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:14,220
Um,
now it's okay.

179
00:08:14,221 --> 00:08:16,620
We might be losing this war.
Now it's not so in vogue,

180
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:22,130
but when you got guys in like 1939 that
are talking eugenics and um,

181
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:28,110
you know,
higher calling for breeding and

182
00:08:28,111 --> 00:08:29,790
segregation,
um,

183
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,680
early on you're like,
Eh,

184
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:36,180
I don't like that guy.
Kona beat him to death with my hands,

185
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:38,010
but he's massive.
So it'd be a pretty good fight.

186
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,490
Yeah,
it was a,

187
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:43,530
there we go.
A form Nazi cult trying to,

188
00:08:43,531 --> 00:08:45,030
what does it say?
Jamie was the full,

189
00:08:45,031 --> 00:08:46,740
uh,
title Nazi Colt.

190
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,810
What does the uh,
so that,

191
00:08:48,811 --> 00:08:50,760
that,
that's just a marketing thing because

192
00:08:50,761 --> 00:08:54,450
it's still the same place.
Reformed Nazi cult trying to open it's

193
00:08:54,451 --> 00:08:56,430
colony to,
and where's this?

194
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:57,730
That's in Chile.
Yeah.

195
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:02,050
I spent a lot of time there right there.
Oh,

196
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:05,760
they made a movie about it.
So that's current day right there.

197
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:11,700
Jesus Christ.
That later hoses range is freaking

198
00:09:11,701 --> 00:09:12,570
gorgeous though.

199
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:14,360
It's,
I mean it is Shangri la.

200
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:16,680
Yeah.
German flag flying.

201
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:19,290
Wow.
They've tried to hide the Nazi things

202
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,780
they've had.
I met some people that I'm like,

203
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,620
I talked to him.
I go,

204
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:23,700
oh,
I'm like a monkey

205
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:28,770
dude.
I talked to your Buddy Eddie Bravo.

206
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:31,410
And that guy is a real,
he's out there.

207
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,780
He's like a jack.
He's like a death,

208
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:34,980
like a death Jack Russell almost,
you know,

209
00:09:34,981 --> 00:09:37,290
a deaf Jack Russell because once he gets
going,

210
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:37,921
you can't,
oh,

211
00:09:37,921 --> 00:09:40,100
Jack Russell terrier.
You ever been around with his dog?

212
00:09:40,101 --> 00:09:41,460
He opened the car and then the next
thing you know,

213
00:09:41,461 --> 00:09:42,294
they're like,
oh yeah,

214
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:43,530
they're like sick.
Yeah,

215
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:44,640
but well,
how's he depth?

216
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:47,280
Cause you can't get him back.
Like once he goes,

217
00:09:47,281 --> 00:09:49,510
you can't,
I was saying,

218
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:53,550
you can't get them back in the car.
Like you're sitting there honking the

219
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:54,420
horn.
You can't,

220
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,060
that guy's out there.
You know my home.

221
00:09:57,090 --> 00:10:01,370
You know what I'm talking about.
But I've never already might make a

222
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:04,770
description like that.
Jack Russell terrier.

223
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:07,140
That is hilarious.
Extravagant dude.

224
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:08,640
Yeah.
That means extravagant,

225
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:12,540
so motivated.
He loves conspiracies more than anybody

226
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:14,550
I've ever met in my life.
And he thinks everything is a

227
00:10:14,551 --> 00:10:15,930
conspiracy.
Yeah,

228
00:10:15,931 --> 00:10:16,351
no,
no,

229
00:10:16,351 --> 00:10:17,184
he definitely,
yeah,

230
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:20,130
but then he gets into it like,
I dunno,

231
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:23,370
it was fascinating to me how he went
from this like one John Rowe of life to

232
00:10:23,371 --> 00:10:26,760
the next and created a business in each
one and kept moving forward.

233
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:27,780
A business.
Yeah.

234
00:10:27,781 --> 00:10:28,790
He got like,
he was a music.

235
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:30,510
He liked music.
He started a band,

236
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:32,700
you know,
he liked karate.

237
00:10:32,701 --> 00:10:34,530
He started doing,
um,

238
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:36,570
you know,
organized karate.

239
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:38,140
He liked,
uh,

240
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,540
you know,
what else did he pee?

241
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:41,610
A couple of other businesses.
I think he got a new,

242
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:43,380
a couple of other things.
I don't know what the other two,

243
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:48,720
he lost me a chapter 70.
But he'll hit you with too much

244
00:10:48,721 --> 00:10:49,590
information,
man.

245
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,510
It was crazy.
A lot of people to Google.

246
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:53,100
I was like,
I want to climb through a black hole

247
00:10:53,101 --> 00:10:55,730
right now.
Casey reason shit.

248
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:56,551
Like,
wait a minute.

249
00:10:56,551 --> 00:10:58,080
It's just kind of the jet dude the other
night,

250
00:10:58,081 --> 00:11:01,980
2:00 AM he sends me a couple of legs.
You gotta shut your phone off.
