1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,230
People though. They really are.
It's just fucking hard business,

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,740
especially when you didn't
see it coming to one.

3
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:12,150
Hello Renee. Hello. Thanks for
doing this. I really appreciate it.

4
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:13,013
Thanks for having me.

5
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:16,680
I listened to you on Sam Harris'
podcast and I was utterly stunned.

6
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:20,610
I had to listen to it twice cause I just
couldn't believe it. Let's get into,

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,430
let's get into this from the beginning.
How did this start out?

8
00:00:23,431 --> 00:00:25,520
How did you start researching these,

9
00:00:25,521 --> 00:00:30,000
a online Russian trolls
and bots and all this jazz?

10
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:34,680
Yeah, so a couple of years
back in around 2015, um, I,

11
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:35,600
I had had my,

12
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,010
my first baby in 2013 and I was getting
on these preschool lists and what I

13
00:00:39,011 --> 00:00:41,860
decided to do was I started looking at,
um,

14
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:46,540
anti vaccine activity in California
because I had a kid and I wanted to, uh,

15
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:48,000
you know,
put them on preschool list.

16
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:50,430
I was going to fit with
the parents basically, um,

17
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:55,440
as someone who vaccinates and I started
looking at the way that small groups,

18
00:00:55,901 --> 00:01:00,220
we're able to kind of disproportionately
amplify messages on social channels.

19
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:03,340
And some of this was through
very legitimate activity.

20
00:01:03,341 --> 00:01:06,370
And then some of it was through really
kind of coordinated deliberate attempts

21
00:01:06,371 --> 00:01:10,540
to Kinda game, um, ways that
algorithms were amplifying content,

22
00:01:10,541 --> 00:01:12,580
amplifying particular types of narratives.

23
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:18,100
And I thought it was interesting and
I started writing about it and I, um,

24
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:22,360
I wound up writing about ways in
which, um, hashtag gaming, um,

25
00:01:22,361 --> 00:01:26,050
ways in which people were kind of using
automation to just be in a Hashtag all

26
00:01:26,051 --> 00:01:26,500
the time.

27
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:29,620
So it was kind of a way to really gain
control of share voice and what that

28
00:01:29,621 --> 00:01:33,640
meant when very small groups of people
could achieve this kind of phenomenal

29
00:01:33,641 --> 00:01:38,500
amplification and what the pros and cons
of that were. And then this was, um,

30
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:42,140
2015. So the way that,
that this sort of, um,

31
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:45,860
awareness of social media challenges came,

32
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:48,460
came about was actually
when I was working on this.

33
00:01:48,461 --> 00:01:52,240
Other people were looking at it from the
same, I'm looking at the same tactics,

34
00:01:52,241 --> 00:01:54,760
but how they were being used by Isis,
by the terrorist organization.

35
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,051
And they're also,

36
00:01:56,051 --> 00:01:59,200
you had this very small group of
people that manage to use bots and

37
00:01:59,201 --> 00:02:02,500
amplification to really kind of own
a narrative, really pushed this,

38
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:06,730
this brand is this digital caliphate to
kind of build it on all social platforms

39
00:02:06,731 --> 00:02:07,840
almost simultaneously.

40
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:12,170
And the ways in which information was
hopping from one platform to another, um,

41
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:15,460
through kind of deliberate coordination
and then also just ways in which

42
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:18,820
information flows, kind
of contagion style. Um,

43
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:23,850
and I wound up working on thinking about
how the government was going to respond

44
00:02:24,821 --> 00:02:28,360
to the challenge of
terrorist organizations using
American social platforms to

45
00:02:28,361 --> 00:02:30,310
spread propaganda.
Uh,

46
00:02:30,311 --> 00:02:34,990
so what we came to realize was that
there was just this information ecosystem

47
00:02:34,991 --> 00:02:38,800
and it had evolved in a certain way over
a period of about eight years or so.

48
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:44,220
And the kind of unintended consequences
of that and the way that Russia kind of

49
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:49,660
came into the conversation
was around October,

50
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:52,510
2015 when we were thinking about what,
what to do about Isis,

51
00:02:52,511 --> 00:02:55,630
what to do about terrorism
and terrorist, uh, you know,

52
00:02:55,631 --> 00:02:57,370
kind of proliferation on social platforms.

53
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:00,460
This was right around when
Chen had written the article,

54
00:03:00,461 --> 00:03:02,110
the Agency for the New York Times.

55
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,710
And that was one of the first big expos
A's of the Internet research agency.

56
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,590
The first time in American journalist
had gone over there and actually met the

57
00:03:08,591 --> 00:03:10,090
trolls,
been in Saint Petersburg,

58
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:14,410
and began to write about
what was happening over
there and the ways that they

59
00:03:14,411 --> 00:03:17,920
had pages that we're targeting
certain facets of American culture.

60
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:23,370
So while we were in DC talking about
what to do about terrorists using these

61
00:03:23,441 --> 00:03:24,940
platforms to spread propaganda,

62
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:29,140
there were beginning to be rumblings
that Russian intelligence and you know,

63
00:03:29,141 --> 00:03:32,680
Russian entities, we're doing the same
thing. And so the question became,

64
00:03:32,681 --> 00:03:36,310
can we think about ways in which the
Internet is vulnerable to this type of

65
00:03:36,311 --> 00:03:39,730
manipulation by anyone? And then, um,

66
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:41,950
and then come up with ways to stop it.

67
00:03:41,951 --> 00:03:44,710
So that was how the Russia
investigation began,

68
00:03:44,711 --> 00:03:49,510
was actually around 2015 and a handful
of people started looking for evidence of

69
00:03:49,511 --> 00:03:51,820
Russian bots and trolls
on social platforms.

70
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:56,920
So 2015 if we think about social
media and the birth of social media,

71
00:03:56,921 --> 00:04:01,510
essentially, it had only been alive
for, I mean, what was Twitter,

72
00:04:01,511 --> 00:04:06,250
2007 I believe. I think so, yeah.
Something like that. So eight years,

73
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:10,780
like eight years of social media and
then all of a sudden they figured out how

74
00:04:10,781 --> 00:04:15,781
to game the system and then they figured
out how to use this to make people

75
00:04:16,601 --> 00:04:17,710
argue against each other.

76
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:22,420
Yeah, I think so. There was this,
uh, if you go back to like, um,

77
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:27,400
you remember like Geo cities and they,
yeah. Okay. AOL Use that course. Um,

78
00:04:27,401 --> 00:04:32,070
so we're probably about the same age.
Um, so there have always been, you know,

79
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,410
kind of the thing thing that was great
about the Internet, like Internet 1.0,

80
00:04:35,411 --> 00:04:36,121
we can call it,
right.

81
00:04:36,121 --> 00:04:39,370
It was this idea that everybody was
given a platform and you could use your

82
00:04:39,371 --> 00:04:42,380
platform, you could put up your blog,
you could say whatever you wanted. Um,

83
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,550
you didn't necessarily get attention,
but you could say whatever you wanted.

84
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:49,070
And so there is this
kind of consolidation as,

85
00:04:49,071 --> 00:04:52,840
as social platforms kind of came
into existence, content creators.

86
00:04:52,841 --> 00:04:56,440
We're really excited about the fact
that now they not only had this, um,

87
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,390
this access to write their own stuff,

88
00:04:58,391 --> 00:05:02,420
but they also had access to this audience
because as the network effects got

89
00:05:02,421 --> 00:05:06,130
more and more pronounced, more and more
people came to be on social platforms.

90
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,740
And an originally it wasn't even Facebook,
if you remember, it was like, you know,

91
00:05:08,741 --> 00:05:12,160
there's like Friendster and myspace
and social networks kind of evolved.

92
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:15,100
When I was in college, Facebook was
still limited to like, you know,

93
00:05:15,101 --> 00:05:19,720
a handful of like Ivy League schools.
And so I wasn't even eligible. And, um,

94
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:23,590
as you watch this consolidation happen,
you,

95
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:27,940
you start to have this information
ecosystem really dominated by a handful of

96
00:05:27,941 --> 00:05:31,240
companies that grow very large because
they're providing a service that people

97
00:05:31,241 --> 00:05:32,490
really want.
Um,

98
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:36,280
but there's a kind of mass consolidation
of audiences onto this handful of

99
00:05:36,281 --> 00:05:37,090
platforms.

100
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:41,050
So this becomes really interesting for
regular people who just want to find

101
00:05:41,051 --> 00:05:44,950
their friends, reach people, spread
their message, growing audience.

102
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:49,630
It also becomes really interesting for
propagandists and trolls and in this case

103
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:51,940
terrorist organizations and
state intelligence services.

104
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:54,490
Cause instead of reaching
the entire Internet,

105
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,410
they really just kind of have to
concentrate their efforts on a handful of

106
00:05:57,411 --> 00:05:58,244
platforms.

107
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,390
So that consolidation is one of the
things that kind of kicks off some of the,

108
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,090
um, one of one of the reasons
that we have these problems today,

109
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:08,250
right? So the, the fact that
there's only a Facebook,

110
00:06:08,251 --> 00:06:13,251
a Twitter and Instagram and a couple
other minor platforms other than Youtube,

111
00:06:13,711 --> 00:06:16,800
I mean anything that you can
tell it's an actual person,

112
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:20,040
like youtube is a problem, right? Because
you could see it's an actual person.

113
00:06:20,041 --> 00:06:23,400
If you have, you're narrating
something, you, you know,

114
00:06:23,401 --> 00:06:27,450
if you're in front of the camera and
explaining things and people were going to

115
00:06:27,451 --> 00:06:28,980
know that you're an actual human being.

116
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:33,380
Whereas there's so many of these
accounts that I'll go to, like I'll,

117
00:06:33,381 --> 00:06:37,740
I'll watch people get involved in these
little online beefs with each other and

118
00:06:37,741 --> 00:06:38,850
then I'll go to some of these accounts.
I'm like,

119
00:06:38,851 --> 00:06:42,210
this doesn't seem like a real person.
And I'll go and it's like Hashtag Maga,

120
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:46,060
there's a American Eagle in
front of a flag. And then you,

121
00:06:46,061 --> 00:06:47,910
you read their stuff and
you're like, wow, this is,

122
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:51,810
this is probably a Russian troll account.
And it's strange,

123
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,060
like you feel like you're not
supposed to be seeing this.

124
00:06:54,061 --> 00:06:56,790
Like you've seen the wiring under the
board or something and then you'll go

125
00:06:56,791 --> 00:07:01,791
through the timeline and all they're
doing is engaging people and arguing,

126
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:05,340
you know, for Trump and against, you know,

127
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:08,700
whatever the fuck they're angry
about, whatever, whatever it is,

128
00:07:08,701 --> 00:07:10,420
it's being discussed and they're,

129
00:07:10,421 --> 00:07:14,070
they're basically just like some
weird little argument mechanism.

130
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:17,340
Yeah. So in 2016, um,

131
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:21,080
there was a lot of that during
the presidential campaign,
right. And there were,

132
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:24,200
um, there was so much that
was written, you know,

133
00:07:24,201 --> 00:07:26,840
we can go back to the free speech thing
we were kind of chatting about before.

134
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:28,950
There's so much that was written about,
um,

135
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:33,410
harassment and trolling and negativity
and these kind of hoards of accounts that

136
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:35,930
would brigade people and harass them.
Of course,

137
00:07:35,931 --> 00:07:37,790
a lot of that is just real Americans,
right?

138
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:40,670
There are plenty of people who are just
assholes on the Internet. Sure. Um,

139
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,420
but there were actually a fair
number of these as we began to do the

140
00:07:44,421 --> 00:07:47,250
investigation into the
Russian operation in,

141
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:52,430
and it started on Twitter and
about, um, 2014, actually, so 2013,

142
00:07:52,431 --> 00:07:57,170
2014, the Internet research agency
is targeting Russian people.

143
00:07:57,171 --> 00:08:01,100
So they're tweeting in Russian,
at Russian and Ukrainian are folks,

144
00:08:01,101 --> 00:08:03,620
people in their sphere of influence.
So they're already on there.

145
00:08:03,621 --> 00:08:04,700
They're already trying this out.

146
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:08,090
And what they're doing is they're
creating these, uh, these, these accounts.

147
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:10,790
It's kind of wrong to call them
bots because they are real people.

148
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:13,220
They're just not what they appear to be.

149
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:16,490
So I think the unfortunate term
for it has become like Cyborg,

150
00:08:16,491 --> 00:08:19,250
like semi automated. You know,
sometimes it's automated,

151
00:08:19,251 --> 00:08:20,480
sometimes it's a real person,

152
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,750
but a sock puppet is the other
way that we can refer to it.

153
00:08:23,751 --> 00:08:25,970
A person pretending to be somebody else.

154
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,580
So you have these sock puppets and
they're out there and they're tweeting.

155
00:08:28,581 --> 00:08:33,581
And in 2014 about the Russian
annexation of Crimea or about mh 17.

156
00:08:34,251 --> 00:08:35,870
That plane that went down with Russia,
you know,

157
00:08:35,871 --> 00:08:38,210
of course I had no idea what happened
and it wasn't their fault at all.

158
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:43,780
And gradually as they begin to experience
what I imagine they thought of what

159
00:08:44,751 --> 00:08:49,460
success, that's when you see some of these
accounts pivot to targeting Americans.

160
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:53,840
And so in 20, late 2014, early
2015, you start to see the,

161
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:58,770
um, the strategy that for a long
time had been very inwardly focused,

162
00:08:58,771 --> 00:09:01,980
making their own people think a certain
way or feel a certain way or have a

163
00:09:01,981 --> 00:09:06,690
certain experience on the Internet. Uh,
it begins to spread out. It begins to, uh,

164
00:09:06,691 --> 00:09:07,524
to look outwards.

165
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:11,310
And so you start to see these
accounts communicating with Americans.

166
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:15,450
And as we were going through the datasets,
which the Twitter data set is public,

167
00:09:15,451 --> 00:09:17,960
anyone can go and look
at it at this point. Um,

168
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,800
you do see some of the accounts that
are kind of, um, you know, that were,

169
00:09:22,801 --> 00:09:26,790
that were somewhat notorious for
being really virulent, nasty trolls.

170
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:30,150
I'm Andy Semitic, trolls
going after journalists. You
know, some of these accounts,

171
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:31,493
um,

172
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:37,740
being revealed as actually being a
Russian trolls now it doesn't kind of, um,

173
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:42,390
Xcel paid the actual American trolls
that were very much real and active and

174
00:09:42,391 --> 00:09:44,670
part of this and expressing their opinion.
Uh,

175
00:09:44,671 --> 00:09:46,860
but you do see that
they're mimicking this,

176
00:09:46,861 --> 00:09:50,190
they're using that same style of tactic,
that harassment to,

177
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:51,510
to get it real people.

178
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,800
Then if they do get banned,
if their account gets banned,

179
00:09:54,801 --> 00:09:59,030
they just simply make another
account. They use some sort of, uh,

180
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:04,370
you know, um, what is it, a virtual
virtual server? What does that call mean?

181
00:10:04,371 --> 00:10:07,880
Vpns or, yeah, so if they do that,

182
00:10:07,881 --> 00:10:10,100
they can kind of do that
as long as they want.

183
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:15,130
They can continue to make new accounts
and it probably also emboldens the actual

184
00:10:16,581 --> 00:10:20,750
mirror controls because they're going
to go out a little bit further than

185
00:10:20,751 --> 00:10:22,340
everybody else.
A little bit crazier.

186
00:10:22,341 --> 00:10:26,540
And it kind of changes the
tone of discourse within
these communities that are

187
00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:27,830
arguing about a certain subject.

188
00:10:27,831 --> 00:10:32,360
Things get nastier and they're getting
nastier because of the interference of

189
00:10:32,361 --> 00:10:34,580
these trolls.
I Gade seems like they've,

190
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:39,140
they've actually managed to not
just cause a lot of discourse,

191
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:43,400
but to change the way people were
interacting with each other and to make it

192
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:45,710
just make it more,
more vicious.

193
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:50,120
Yeah. So the, what they're doing is
they're operating in communities.

194
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:53,960
So one of the really common criticisms
of, you know, people who, um,

195
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,990
lot of people think that this didn't
have a huge impact. Didn't, you know,

196
00:10:56,991 --> 00:11:00,230
did it swing the election?
We have no idea. Um, but the,

197
00:11:00,231 --> 00:11:04,670
what it does do in the communities that
it targets is it can change that tone.

198
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,020
And that's where you see,
um, it's, it's, I mean,

199
00:11:09,021 --> 00:11:10,490
I think everybody's probably
had this experience,

200
00:11:10,491 --> 00:11:13,040
you're part of a group and then a new
person gets added to the group and the

201
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:15,590
dynamic changes. Yeah. It's very
much the same kind of thing.

202
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:19,080
Just that these are not real people
who are joining the group. Uh,

203
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:23,710
and so there's this,
um, opportunity to, to,

204
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:24,770
to,
you know,

205
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:29,480
kind of expand the bounds of tolerance
just that little bit more or try to

206
00:11:29,481 --> 00:11:34,190
normalize using particular ways of
communicating that maybe a group wouldn't

207
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:37,060
naturally gravitate to.
But then it does. So there,

208
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:41,060
there are definitely a ways in which any,

209
00:11:41,061 --> 00:11:43,790
any type of troll during this doesn't
have to be a Russian troll has this

210
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:47,190
ability to kind of shift the language
shift the community shifts the, uh,

211
00:11:47,191 --> 00:11:48,380
the culture just a little bit.

212
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:53,650
Now, when did, why did the agency
do this and do we, do we know,

213
00:11:53,651 --> 00:11:58,000
do we have someone who's ever left there
or become a whistle blower who can give

214
00:11:58,001 --> 00:12:02,650
us some information about what the
mandate was and how it was carried out?

215
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:06,770
There've been a couple of a whistle
blowers and actually some investigative

216
00:12:06,771 --> 00:12:11,110
journalism in Russia that's, that's
covered this. Um, they describe the,

217
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:13,850
the employees of the,
it says the Internet research agency.

218
00:12:13,851 --> 00:12:18,170
So it's a little bit like a social
media marketing agency plus, um,

219
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:21,380
tactics that we would not expect a
social media marketing agency to use.

220
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:25,460
Things that are a little more like
what you would expect to see from an

221
00:12:25,461 --> 00:12:26,420
intelligence agency.

222
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,260
So besides just making your pages
and your blogs and your social posts,

223
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:32,990
they're also in their kind of,
uh,

224
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:36,980
connecting with real people and real
activists and pretending to be something

225
00:12:36,981 --> 00:12:41,960
that they're not to develop kind of a
one on one relationship, but most of the,

226
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:44,630
most of the, um, the whistle
blowers who have come out,

227
00:12:44,631 --> 00:12:48,260
there's a woman named Ludmila,
Mila salvage chuck. Um,

228
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:53,350
she wrote an say I believe on this and
it's described as being much like you

229
00:12:53,741 --> 00:12:56,300
would expect if you were doing
social media grunt work. Um,

230
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:59,030
you have a certain number of posts per
day. You, you know, you're driving,

231
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:02,150
trying to get a certain amount
of engagement. Um, you're trying,

232
00:13:02,151 --> 00:13:05,480
you've got to kind of hit your quotas.
I'm, most people are young millennials,

233
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:09,170
the people that work there, um, they're
well versed in trolling culture.

234
00:13:09,171 --> 00:13:11,030
They're well versed in internet culture.
You know,

235
00:13:11,031 --> 00:13:14,510
they're up to speed on like
popular memes and things like that.

236
00:13:14,511 --> 00:13:18,410
And so you do see, um, this, you know,

237
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:21,200
and then the other thing that they do is
they talk about in Mueller indictment,

238
00:13:21,201 --> 00:13:24,800
you see some really interesting
descriptions of like the
standups that they have

239
00:13:24,801 --> 00:13:26,300
stand is a thing you do at a tech company.

240
00:13:26,301 --> 00:13:29,780
Everybody kind of stands up and you talk
about your goals and responsibilities

241
00:13:29,781 --> 00:13:30,620
and blockers and things.

242
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:34,190
And in these standups they would be
sitting there saying things like, um,

243
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:37,370
if you're targeting black LGBT people,

244
00:13:37,371 --> 00:13:39,470
make sure you don't use
white people in your,

245
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:43,140
in your image and your mean because that's
going to trigger them. Um, you know,

246
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:46,460
so trying to get at
the, the very niche, um,

247
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:51,230
rules for, you know, for communicating
authentically and an American community,

248
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:53,770
which is, you know, online,
you know, you sometimes, um,

249
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:58,790
there are very specific ways in which
a community expects a member of that

250
00:13:58,791 --> 00:13:59,760
community to communicate.

251
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:05,150
And so they are in there and you can read
in these filings by Mueller's team and

252
00:14:05,151 --> 00:14:09,670
by the Eastern District
of Virginia. Um, the, the,

253
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:14,720
the degree of granularity that they have
to recognize that if you are running a

254
00:14:14,721 --> 00:14:17,390
black LGBT page and your
meme is of white people,

255
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:21,770
you're going to cause some tension and
consternation and assuming that that's

256
00:14:21,771 --> 00:14:23,180
not necessarily what you want to be doing,

257
00:14:23,181 --> 00:14:27,310
you should go find the meme of black
LGBT people to put in the, you know, to,

258
00:14:27,311 --> 00:14:30,590
to put as your meme for the
day. So there's a lot of, um,

259
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,000
there's a lot of sophistication,

260
00:14:32,001 --> 00:14:35,990
there's a lot of understanding of
American culture and then there's a lot of

261
00:14:35,991 --> 00:14:37,370
understanding of trolling culture.

262
00:14:37,371 --> 00:14:41,720
And so these things combined to be
a rather effective, uh, you know,

263
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:43,640
very effective social media agency.

264
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:48,120
Then is there an overwhelming sort of
narrative that they're trying to pursue?

265
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:49,740
The trying to push?
Yeah,

266
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,460
so what we saw, so I did the, um,

267
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:56,630
I did some of the research for the
Senate and the Senate data came from the

268
00:14:56,631 --> 00:15:00,290
platforms. So what I had was, um, the
attribution was made by the platforms.

269
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:04,680
It wasn't like Renee deciding
this was IRA. It was the
platforms giving it to, uh,

270
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:07,520
to our government.
And the

271
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:11,390
information in there.
Um,

272
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:16,520
what it showed was that
across all platforms, across
Twitter, across Facebook,

273
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:20,120
Instagram, youtube, they
were building up tribes.

274
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:24,620
So they were really working to create
distinct communities of distinct types of

275
00:15:24,621 --> 00:15:27,860
Americans. And that would be, for example,

276
00:15:27,861 --> 00:15:32,190
there's an LGBT page that is very
much about LGBT pride. There is,

277
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:37,940
and they created it, they curated
and they create it, curate it.

278
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:41,390
Um, it has a, you know,
there, it's like a persona.

279
00:15:41,391 --> 00:15:45,230
A lot of the posts on the LGBT page were
written by what sounded kind of like a

280
00:15:45,231 --> 00:15:50,150
millennial lesbian was the voice.
Um, so it was a lot of, um, you know,

281
00:15:50,151 --> 00:15:54,080
memes of LGBT actresses and they
would brand it with a specific brand.

282
00:15:54,081 --> 00:15:58,820
Market was a rainbow heart. Um, uh,
LGBT United was the name of the page.

283
00:15:58,821 --> 00:16:00,290
It had a matching Instagram account,

284
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:02,780
which you would also expect to
see from a media property. Right.

285
00:16:02,781 --> 00:16:06,830
You would expect them to see in
both places. And this, um, you know,

286
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:11,580
they're red liga or like a, a
young woman talking about, um,

287
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:15,980
crushes on actresses and things. Actually,
you know, it was, it was, it was really,

288
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:20,720
besides the sometimes walking English
virtually indistinguishable from what you

289
00:16:20,721 --> 00:16:24,620
had read on any kind of like
young millennial focused, um,

290
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:27,230
social page.
It wasn't,

291
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:32,090
none of it was radical or divisive.
It wasn't like,

292
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:33,163
um,

293
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:38,060
the way that they got the division
across was they built these tribes where

294
00:16:38,061 --> 00:16:42,560
they're reinforcing in group dynamics.
So you have the LGBT page,

295
00:16:42,561 --> 00:16:45,800
you have a numerous pages
targeting the black community.

296
00:16:45,801 --> 00:16:49,460
That was where they spent most of their
energy. A lot of pages targeting, um,

297
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:53,920
far right? So, uh, both
old far right, meaning, um,

298
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:57,620
people who are very concerned about what
does the future of America look like.

299
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:00,620
And then young, far right,
which was much more angry,

300
00:17:00,621 --> 00:17:02,150
much more like trolling culture.

301
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:04,970
So they recognize that there's a divide
there that the kinds of memes you're

302
00:17:04,971 --> 00:17:07,190
gonna use to target younger,

303
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:10,190
right wing audiences are not the same
kinds of memes are going to use to target

304
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:14,900
older right wing audiences. So there's
a tribe for older rightwing younger,

305
00:17:14,901 --> 00:17:17,690
right wing and the black community.
There's a baptist tribe,

306
00:17:17,691 --> 00:17:21,680
there's a black liberation tribe,
there's a add black women tribe,

307
00:17:21,681 --> 00:17:25,910
there's one for people who have
incarcerated spouses. There's a, uh,

308
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:28,160
Brown,
I'm Brown.

309
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,660
Power I believe was the name of it page
that was very much about Mexican and

310
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:37,430
Chicano culture. There was native
Americans United I, all of these are fake.

311
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,370
All these are fake. And what are
they trying to do with all these?

312
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:45,050
So you build up this in group dynamic
and over, and I did this over years.

313
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:49,410
So this was not a short term thing.
They started these pages and 20, 14, 20,

314
00:17:49,411 --> 00:17:51,780
15 timeframe, most of them, um,

315
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:54,570
they started some other ones that
were much more political later.

316
00:17:54,571 --> 00:17:58,670
And we can talk about the election if you
want to, but with this tribal thing, um,

317
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:02,880
you're building up tribe. So you're
saying like as black women in America,

318
00:18:02,881 --> 00:18:06,900
this is, um, here's posts about
things that we care about.

319
00:18:06,901 --> 00:18:10,110
Here's posts about black hair,
here's posts about child rearing,

320
00:18:10,111 --> 00:18:12,960
here's posts about fashion and culture.

321
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:18,240
And then every now and then there would
be a post that would reinforce like as

322
00:18:18,241 --> 00:18:21,120
black people, we don't do this. And so,

323
00:18:21,121 --> 00:18:25,560
or as LGBT people we don't like this.
And so you're building this rapport.

324
00:18:25,561 --> 00:18:27,480
So like me and you were
having a conversation,

325
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:30,150
we're developing a relationship
on this page over time.

326
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:35,790
And then I say like as this kind
of person, we don't believe this.

327
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:40,530
So it's a way to subtly influenced
by appealing to an ingroup dynamic or

328
00:18:40,531 --> 00:18:43,800
appealing to like as members
of this tribe, as LGBT people.

329
00:18:43,801 --> 00:18:46,650
Of course we hate Mike
Pence as black people.

330
00:18:46,651 --> 00:18:48,840
Of course we're not going to vote because,
you know,

331
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:52,830
we'd hate Hillary Clinton because
we hate her husband as, um,

332
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:58,010
as people who are concerned about the
future of America is Texas assumptionists

333
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:02,700
you know, so, so everything is
presented as members of this tribe.

334
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:06,360
We think this as members of this tribe,
we don't think this,

335
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:07,860
that's why you see the,

336
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:10,930
I had a lot of,
the posts were not even political.

337
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:15,220
They were just sort of affirming
the standards of the tribe. Yes.

338
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:19,480
So they were kind of setting
up this whole long game. Yep.

339
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:24,100
And then once they got everybody on
board or how many followers are these,

340
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:25,690
do these pages have?

341
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:29,460
So the, there was kind of
a long tail. There were um,

342
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:34,230
I think 88 pages on Facebook and 133
Instagram accounts. And I would say maybe

343
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:40,230
30 of the Facebook pages had
over a thousand followers,
which is not very many.

344
00:19:40,231 --> 00:19:45,210
And then, um, maybe the top 10
had upwards of 500,000 followers.

345
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,240
So there's, you know, same way
you run any social campaigns.

346
00:19:48,241 --> 00:19:50,560
Sometimes you have hit,
sometimes you have flops. Right.

347
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:54,210
And what was interesting with the flops
as you would see them repurpose them so

348
00:19:54,211 --> 00:19:58,320
they would decide, you know, the same way
if you're running a social media agency,

349
00:19:58,321 --> 00:20:01,050
well we've got this audience,
this page isn't doing so well.

350
00:20:01,051 --> 00:20:04,260
It's like rebrand it a little
bit, change it up, try to, um,

351
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:08,850
try to make it appeal to somebody else.
So you, so you do see this, there is a,

352
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,133
there is,
um,

353
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:15,740
I got this data set and I was going
through these Instagram memes and you 130,

354
00:20:15,811 --> 00:20:19,440
3000 of them.
And I was um,

355
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:24,150
there was a cluster of
images of Kermit the frog.

356
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:29,370
I was like, what the hell
is Kermit the frog doing in
here? And so I, so then I go,

357
00:20:29,371 --> 00:20:30,240
so this,
the,

358
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:34,590
the way the platforms provide the data
is I got like a CSV of the posts and then

359
00:20:34,591 --> 00:20:37,290
I got a folder of the images.
And so in order to like connect the dots,

360
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:39,750
I had to have the image up on one screen.
And the,

361
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:43,950
this I'm thinking to the CSP up
on the other screen, CSV. Uh,

362
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,810
it's like a spreadsheet. Okay. Yeah.

363
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:50,990
And I turned it into a database that
we could track things a little bit more

364
00:20:51,611 --> 00:20:53,410
easily across the platforms. But, um,

365
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:55,930
so I have this cluster
of Kermit the frog memes.

366
00:20:55,931 --> 00:20:57,680
And I go and I look
and I realize that the,

367
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:01,540
they're attributed to an account
called army of Jesus. And I thought,

368
00:21:01,541 --> 00:21:03,490
well that's interesting because you know,
these are,

369
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:07,960
some of them are really Raunchy. It was
like, it was like Kermit Miss Piggy,

370
00:21:07,961 --> 00:21:12,730
like you know, I mean it was just like,
like stupid, a stupid crappy memes.

371
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:16,000
Um, attached to army of Jesus and
like the hell is going on here.

372
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:17,591
I keep going through it.

373
00:21:17,591 --> 00:21:21,540
Hundreds of Kermit memes and then I
get to a post where they say like, um,

374
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:26,830
this page is owned by homer Simpson.
Now Kermit went to jail for being like,

375
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:29,060
I don't know,
they made some like some joke,

376
00:21:29,061 --> 00:21:34,061
it was stupid and all of a sudden the
data set turns into homer Simpson memes.

377
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:38,620
So again, like this kind of
Raunchy homer Simpson culture, um,

378
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:41,570
and again, it's attributed to
army of Jesus. And then, yeah,

379
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:45,490
go through all this and realize that they
didn't get to actually making army of

380
00:21:45,491 --> 00:21:49,660
Jesus a Jesus focused page
until like 900 posts in.

381
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:52,570
So the, they just renamed
the account at some point.

382
00:21:52,571 --> 00:21:54,220
It used to be called nuts news.

383
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:57,940
And then they nuts news was what they
called it when it was the Kermit the frog

384
00:21:57,941 --> 00:22:01,300
meme page. And then it gets repurposed
when they realize Kermit's not doing it.

385
00:22:01,301 --> 00:22:04,840
It's not getting the audience they want
homer Simpson's not getting the audience

386
00:22:04,841 --> 00:22:05,740
or engagement they want.

387
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:09,790
And then they pivot over to Jesus and
then all of a sudden they start, you know,

388
00:22:09,791 --> 00:22:11,980
the likes and,
and things start pouring in.

389
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:16,270
So what they're doing is they're actually
like either deliberately or they're

390
00:22:16,271 --> 00:22:19,180
just creating placeholders.
Um,

391
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:23,770
it's kind of a red flag when a brand
new account that was created yesterday

392
00:22:23,771 --> 00:22:27,070
suddenly starts talking about some highly
politically divisive thing or whatever.

393
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:30,340
But if you lay the groundwork and
you do it over a period of two years,

394
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:34,660
then somebody who goes and checks
to see what the account was,

395
00:22:34,661 --> 00:22:36,250
where it came from,
how old it is,

396
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:38,140
is going to see something
that was two years old.

397
00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:42,910
So it's an opportunity to create almost
like sleeper accounts where you create

398
00:22:42,911 --> 00:22:45,880
them now and then you activate them,
you politicize them,

399
00:22:45,881 --> 00:22:48,490
you actually put them to use a
couple of years in the future.

400
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:53,380
So we saw all kinds of, uh, you know,
we, we saw this over and over again.

401
00:22:53,381 --> 00:22:58,381
There was a black guns matter account
that turned into an anonymous account at

402
00:22:58,451 --> 00:23:02,260
one point. Um, they were pretending to be
anonymous, you know, the hacktivist. Yeah.

403
00:23:02,261 --> 00:23:06,700
So, so they repurpose this black guns
matter page, which just had, it was,

404
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:10,630
it was advocating that black people buy
weapons and carry and it was like a pro

405
00:23:10,631 --> 00:23:12,850
second amendment page,
but for the black community.

406
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,520
And they took that page
when it wasn't getting,

407
00:23:15,521 --> 00:23:20,150
I guess a ton of engagement and
it became a, it was called, um,

408
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:23,620
oh gosh, I don't remember the
exact name of the anonymous page.

409
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:27,310
And I don't want to say it was
something that's legit, but, but ah,

410
00:23:27,311 --> 00:23:30,940
they pivoted into an anonymous page.
And when they do that,

411
00:23:30,941 --> 00:23:35,470
do they go back and repurpose the
con the content of the earlier posts?

412
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:38,980
Do they change? That was not
clear. That wasn't clear.

413
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:41,650
We didn't get that information
from the platforms. Um,

414
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:46,340
there was a lot of stuff that I
would've loved to have insight into.

415
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:47,750
We could see again,
you know,

416
00:23:47,751 --> 00:23:51,020
you'd think if you started following
an army of Jesus page and yet all this

417
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:53,360
Raunchy Kermit shit from like a year
ago that would raise some flags.

418
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:57,440
I would assume that they scrubbed
it and restart it. But I don't know

419
00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:01,940
your podcast with Sam changed how I look
at a lot of the pages that I actually

420
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:06,941
follow cause I follow some pages like
that have classic cars or something like

421
00:24:07,161 --> 00:24:11,690
that. And then I'll see them in, most
of it is just photographs of cars,

422
00:24:11,691 --> 00:24:14,390
like beautiful cars and it'll have,
you know,

423
00:24:14,391 --> 00:24:17,450
they'll have a giant following and
then all of a sudden something will get

424
00:24:17,451 --> 00:24:21,230
political and I'll, I'll
look at it and go, oh wow.

425
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:23,960
Like this is probably one
of those weird accounts.

426
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:29,350
Like they're getting people to get
engaged with it because it represents

427
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:30,830
something that they're interested in,

428
00:24:30,831 --> 00:24:35,831
like classic muscle cars and then they
use it for activism and they use it for,

429
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:37,880
to,
to get this narrative across.

430
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:42,140
I think I, I mean I've seen it
happen with some of mine too. Um,

431
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:45,530
I think one of the challenges is like,

432
00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:49,220
you want people to be aware
that this stuff exists,

433
00:24:49,221 --> 00:24:51,410
but you don't want them to be
paranoid that it's everywhere.

434
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:54,150
I know that's a problem.

435
00:24:56,930 --> 00:24:59,900
I look at this all day long and
sometimes I see things and I'm like,

436
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:05,030
[inaudible] what are the odds? Um,
but, and I, and I try to, you know,

437
00:25:05,031 --> 00:25:06,110
not feel like, you know, you know what,

438
00:25:06,111 --> 00:25:10,760
I'm like filmmaker in some like Tom
Clancy novel. But yeah, the, um, it's,

439
00:25:10,761 --> 00:25:14,540
it's this balance between when
you make people aware of it,

440
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,090
and I think people deserve to be aware,

441
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:17,780
but they deserve to
understand how this plays out.

442
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:21,260
The flip side of that is you do
wind up in these weird, you know,

443
00:25:21,261 --> 00:25:23,850
you see it happen on
social media now, or, um,

444
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:26,810
click into a Trump tweet and you'll
see like, you're a Russian Bot. No,

445
00:25:26,811 --> 00:25:30,750
you're a Russian Bot. Know you're like,
they're probably not rushing pots.

446
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:33,410
You know, it's in everybody who don't,
like on the Internet is not a Russian Bot.

447
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:35,900
Yeah,
exactly.

448
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:41,290
And so that's where you get at
the interesting conversations of,

449
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:46,700
you know, in some ways
getting caught. This is,

450
00:25:46,701 --> 00:25:49,640
this is one of the challenges with running
disinformation campaigns, right? It,

451
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:53,620
it makes it really hard for people to
know what's real after the fact that it

452
00:25:53,621 --> 00:25:58,160
leaves you a little bit off balance,
right? Feel like, um, you know,

453
00:25:59,060 --> 00:25:59,893
when

454
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:05,240
you feel like you can't quite tell
what's real and that's part of the goal,

455
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:10,250
right? It's to make you not have a,
not feel entirely balanced and, um,

456
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:12,770
and your information environment
is this real? Is this not?

457
00:26:12,771 --> 00:26:17,000
And so in some ways there's not
much downside to doing this right,

458
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:18,320
because you do,
you know,

459
00:26:18,321 --> 00:26:22,070
if you either knock it out of the park
and you influenced the election and you

460
00:26:22,071 --> 00:26:26,090
influence people and you have this secret
covert operation going on for years,

461
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:30,350
um, or you get caught and
then there's a, you know,

462
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:35,660
until there's some confidence and the
ability of platforms to detect this stuff,

463
00:26:35,661 --> 00:26:39,640
there's real concern among everybody
that, um, that you're either,

464
00:26:39,641 --> 00:26:44,190
you're encountering something
fake. Now, the overwhelming

465
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:49,190
narrative is that the Russians were
very much invested in having Trump win.

466
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:51,990
Right.

467
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:56,700
And if they were very much invested in
having Trump win was the reason why they

468
00:26:56,701 --> 00:27:00,270
focus so heavily on the African American
community because the African American

469
00:27:00,271 --> 00:27:02,970
community traditionally
seems to vote Democrat.

470
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:07,680
So they were trying to do something to
break that up or trying to do something

471
00:27:07,681 --> 00:27:11,370
to weaken the position
of the, the, you know,

472
00:27:11,371 --> 00:27:15,450
the incumbent or a Hilary Clinton and
maybe put some emphasis on Jill Stein or

473
00:27:15,451 --> 00:27:16,890
some alternative candidates.

474
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:21,960
Yeah. So the, the way that
the political campaign,

475
00:27:21,961 --> 00:27:24,210
the political aspect of it played out.
So they established,

476
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:28,320
they started building these relationships
in 2015 and yeah, they're doing this,

477
00:27:28,321 --> 00:27:31,290
this tribal thing. We've got our
ingroup are part of this community.

478
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:35,640
And then what you start to see them
do is, um, early, they're actually,

479
00:27:35,650 --> 00:27:36,540
there was a tiny,

480
00:27:36,541 --> 00:27:41,541
tiny cluster in the early primaries
where they were supporting rand Paul and

481
00:27:42,330 --> 00:27:45,900
then they pivot to Trump pretty
quickly and use, I'm probably ran,

482
00:27:45,901 --> 00:27:47,490
Paul just didn't pull
well and they were like,

483
00:27:47,491 --> 00:27:52,110
there's no way to get any lift here. But,
but maybe Trump was getting, you know,

484
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:56,760
some actual lift in the media. And so, so
you see them move into supporting Trump,

485
00:27:56,761 --> 00:28:00,810
and then for the remainder of the
Dataset for it from 2015 through the end,

486
00:28:00,811 --> 00:28:04,770
which was mid 2017 or so, is
when this thing ends. Um, it's,

487
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:08,660
it's adamantly pro Trump on
the right and on the right.

488
00:28:08,661 --> 00:28:09,990
And you see not only pro Trump,

489
00:28:09,991 --> 00:28:14,991
but you see them really working to
like a road support for mainstream or

490
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:18,060
traditional Republicans,
traditional conservatives.

491
00:28:18,061 --> 00:28:20,490
You see a lot of the memes about like,
um,

492
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:23,460
are you with the Conservatives are
the Conservatives and there, you know,

493
00:28:23,461 --> 00:28:25,500
and so the Conservatives
of course, her, like,

494
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:29,580
they've got pictures of
like Lindsey Graham and John
Mccain, the, Hey John Mccain,

495
00:28:29,581 --> 00:28:34,350
John Mccain shows up a million
times. Um, and, uh, Marco Rubio,

496
00:28:34,351 --> 00:28:38,850
Ted Cruz. Well, I think that they,
you know, one of the theories is,

497
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:41,580
um, and, and I believe
this is probably true.

498
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:46,050
They really strongly disliked Hillary
Clinton because there was concern that she

499
00:28:46,051 --> 00:28:46,531
would,
you know,

500
00:28:46,531 --> 00:28:49,410
things that she was saying about
increasing freedoms in Russia were very

501
00:28:49,411 --> 00:28:54,080
threatening. Uh, they thought the best bet
to get sanctions removed was Trump. Um,

502
00:28:54,090 --> 00:28:59,010
so they had specific outcomes that they
were hoping for. And that was one of,

503
00:28:59,011 --> 00:29:01,020
you know, so there's always
like a political motivation.

504
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,650
So there is this narrative around they
just want to kind of like screw with

505
00:29:04,651 --> 00:29:07,560
American society, create
divisions, amplify divisions.

506
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:10,640
When you look at the political content,
the clear and,

507
00:29:10,930 --> 00:29:15,180
and sustained support for Trump.
And even more than that,

508
00:29:15,181 --> 00:29:19,680
the clear disdain for Hillary Clinton.
There is not on Facebook and Instagram,

509
00:29:19,681 --> 00:29:23,160
there was not one single pro Hillary post.

510
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:26,670
There were some anti Trump posts.
Because if you're running an LGBT page,

511
00:29:26,671 --> 00:29:30,170
of course they're going to say negative
things about Trump, you know, and,

512
00:29:30,171 --> 00:29:34,350
and they're saying it. So you should vote
for Jill Stein. There was early support,

513
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:37,050
um, and some of the left leaning
pages for Bernie Sanders,

514
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:41,830
but you actually see the support for
Bernie Sanders come in more after it

515
00:29:41,831 --> 00:29:46,060
becomes clear that he's not going to
win because then they're using Bernie

516
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:51,060
Sanders as a way to say this was stolen
from him by the evil Clintons or Jill

517
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:55,470
Stein. You know, here's a true, a
true independent, real liberal, uh,

518
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,670
we should be voting for her
if we want to support a woman.

519
00:29:57,671 --> 00:30:01,150
So there these feminism pages really
pushing this narrative of Jill Stein.

520
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:04,990
So you have the left leaning pages,
totally anti Clinton,

521
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,260
and then you have the right leaning pages,
staunchly pro Trump,

522
00:30:08,261 --> 00:30:13,150
and also strongly anti cruise,
Anti Rubio, a anti Lindsey Graham,

523
00:30:13,151 --> 00:30:18,140
basically ante every now what's
called establishment Republican. Um,

524
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,900
and there's this,
uh,

525
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:24,880
kind of pushing of people two opposite
opposite ends of the political spectrum.

526
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:28,930
So this is where you get
at the conversation around
facilitating polarization.

527
00:30:29,290 --> 00:30:32,380
So not just, um, it,

528
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:35,020
it wasn't enough to just
support Donald Trump.

529
00:30:35,021 --> 00:30:39,430
It was also necessary
to strongly disparage,

530
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:43,750
um,
the kind of traditional conservative,

531
00:30:43,751 --> 00:30:48,400
moderate center right in the course
of amplifying the Trump candidacy.

532
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:51,040
Does that make sense? Yes, it
does. And it was a lot of stuff.

533
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:53,180
Yeah, it is a lot of stuff,
but it does make sense.

534
00:30:53,181 --> 00:30:57,230
And one of the things that was really
bizarre to me watching the election and I

535
00:30:57,231 --> 00:31:01,790
was trying to figure out is this because
Trump is so bombastic and he's so

536
00:31:01,791 --> 00:31:04,610
outrageous and he's just a
different person that the,

537
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:08,450
the way I was describing it on stage was
that like finally the assholes have a

538
00:31:08,451 --> 00:31:10,940
king because they never had a king before.

539
00:31:10,941 --> 00:31:15,941
Like everyone who was running for
president was at least mostly dignified.

540
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:21,050
I mean basically it's really difficult
to go back in time and find someone who

541
00:31:21,051 --> 00:31:23,300
isn't going to find someone who,

542
00:31:23,810 --> 00:31:26,420
there's no one who insults
people like he does.

543
00:31:26,810 --> 00:31:30,500
I mean he insults people's appearances.
He calls them losers.

544
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:34,970
He called stormy Daniels Horseface.
I mean he said some outrageous shit.

545
00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:39,140
So part of it was me thinking like, wow,
maybe he's just ignited and embolden.

546
00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:42,310
I actually had this conversation
with my wife today. She was like a,

547
00:31:42,390 --> 00:31:46,430
it feels like racism is more prevalent.
Like it's more,

548
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:51,440
it's more accepted. People feel more
emboldened because they're in their mind,

549
00:31:51,441 --> 00:31:55,520
they think he is a racist. I can get away
with more things. Trump is president.

550
00:31:55,790 --> 00:31:59,450
Like there's actually videos of people
saying racist Shit and saying, hey,

551
00:31:59,451 --> 00:32:03,080
Trump's president, now we can
do this. So I was thinking that,

552
00:32:03,081 --> 00:32:04,110
well maybe that's what it was,

553
00:32:04,111 --> 00:32:08,960
is just sort of like some rare flower
that only blooms under the right

554
00:32:08,961 --> 00:32:11,090
conditions. Poof, it's back. Right?

555
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:16,630
But when you think about the influence
that these pages have had in establishing

556
00:32:17,781 --> 00:32:21,530
communities and this long
game that they're playing,

557
00:32:21,890 --> 00:32:25,520
like the LGBT pages,
even though they're shitting on Trump,

558
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:29,240
they really want to support Jill Stein
because they know that I'll actually help

559
00:32:29,241 --> 00:32:32,930
Trump because it'll take votes away
from Hillary Clinton that they,

560
00:32:33,650 --> 00:32:38,650
it seems different like
political discourse discussions
online and social media,

561
00:32:40,461 --> 00:32:42,280
the way social media reacted.
I mean,

562
00:32:42,281 --> 00:32:46,490
there's a lot of people that were anti
Obama, uh, before me. No, me either,

563
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:50,450
either of his election, he
won, but it seemed different.

564
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:53,870
It seemed different to me than this one.
This one seemed like,

565
00:32:54,790 --> 00:32:58,760
like we had moved into another level of
hostility that never experienced before

566
00:32:58,761 --> 00:33:03,290
and another level of division between
the right and the left that I had never

567
00:33:03,291 --> 00:33:05,360
experienced before. And, uh,

568
00:33:05,361 --> 00:33:10,361
up like a willingness to
engage with really harsh,

569
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:15,860
nasty comments and just to dive into it,

570
00:33:15,861 --> 00:33:17,870
you would see it all day.
I mean there's,

571
00:33:17,871 --> 00:33:21,740
there's certain Twitter followers that I
think they're pretty much human beings,

572
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:26,980
but I would follow them and they would
just be engaged with people all day long

573
00:33:27,441 --> 00:33:31,820
just shitting on people and
criticizing this and insulting that.

574
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:35,630
And it seemed like it seemed dangerous.

575
00:33:35,810 --> 00:33:39,470
It seemed like things had moved
into a much more aggressive,

576
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:45,280
much more hostile and confrontational
sort of chapter in American history.

577
00:33:46,010 --> 00:33:50,450
If this is all done at the same
time that this is happening,

578
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:55,470
w how much of an influence do you think
this IRA agency had on all this stuff?

579
00:33:58,390 --> 00:33:59,223
That's the,
uh,

580
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:02,530
that's the question that we would all
like the answer to and I unfortunately

581
00:34:02,531 --> 00:34:05,920
can't give it. And so in your
mind though, yeah, let me, let me,

582
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:07,750
let me kind of caveat that.
Um,

583
00:34:08,770 --> 00:34:13,690
the thing that we don't have that nobody
who looks at this on the outside has,

584
00:34:13,691 --> 00:34:17,110
is we can't see what people
said in response to this stuff.

585
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:22,060
So I've looked at now almost
200,000 of these posts,

586
00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:25,990
um, as what I spent most of last year
doing was, was this, was this research,

587
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:30,790
and we can see that they have
thousands of engagements,

588
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:33,070
thousands of comments,
thousands of shares.

589
00:34:33,430 --> 00:34:37,690
We have no idea what happened afterwards.
And that's the problem.

590
00:34:37,691 --> 00:34:40,390
So when once the stuff comes down,

591
00:34:40,391 --> 00:34:42,610
it's really hard to go
back and piece it together.

592
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:47,530
So I can see that there are some,
uh, per your point, the really,

593
00:34:47,531 --> 00:34:50,890
really just fucking horrible
troll accounts that they ran.

594
00:34:51,310 --> 00:34:54,520
They didn't necessarily have a lot of
followers, but you see them in there,

595
00:34:54,521 --> 00:34:57,350
like adding people, so
they're, you know, at,

596
00:34:57,351 --> 00:35:00,250
and then the name of a reporter
at the name of a prominent person.

597
00:35:00,251 --> 00:35:03,250
And so they're in their kind of like
draft on the popularity of, you know,

598
00:35:03,251 --> 00:35:08,080
famous people basically. Um, and
they're just saying like horrible shit

599
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:11,740
and it's,
the tone is so spot on.

600
00:35:11,741 --> 00:35:14,020
And one thing that was interesting with
a couple of them is like if you go and

601
00:35:14,021 --> 00:35:17,140
you look at their profile information,
which was also made public,

602
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:21,700
they would have like, um, they would
have like a gab account in their,

603
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,940
in their profile that was
like, so they would, um,

604
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:27,580
so it was a remarkable piece of,
of,

605
00:35:27,910 --> 00:35:29,770
of kind of the culture
in which you see that.

606
00:35:29,771 --> 00:35:32,320
Like they're actually sitting on Gab too,
right.

607
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:35,440
And so they can also go and they can
draw on there and read it. And there's,

608
00:35:35,441 --> 00:35:37,230
you know,
900 or something,

609
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,540
a troll accounts were found
on reddit there on tumbler.

610
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:44,840
And so they're just picking
the most divisive content
and they're pushing it out

611
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:49,470
into communities. And at the same
time we can see that they're doing it,

612
00:35:49,471 --> 00:35:52,650
but we can't see what people do in
return. We can't see, did they just block?

613
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:56,100
Did they have the fight back?
Did, was there a huge, you know,

614
00:35:56,490 --> 00:35:59,310
when this happens on a Facebook page,
um,

615
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,200
and they're doing something like
telling black people not to vote, um,

616
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:07,920
as black people, we shouldn't vote.
Um, what do people say in response?

617
00:36:07,921 --> 00:36:10,860
And that's the piece that we don't have.
So when we talk about impact,

618
00:36:10,890 --> 00:36:13,430
a lot of the impact
conversation is really uh,

619
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:16,890
focused on did this swing the election?

620
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:21,030
We don't have nothing that I've seen
has the answer to that question. Um,

621
00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:24,780
the other thing is, but the
second question, the thing
when I think about impact,

622
00:36:24,781 --> 00:36:28,350
I think from, from, I think
you and I agree on this, um,

623
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:31,620
it also matters how does this change
how people relate to each other.

624
00:36:32,370 --> 00:36:37,170
And we have no real evidence of
no information on that either.

625
00:36:37,171 --> 00:36:39,960
This is the kind of thing that lives
in some, you know, Facebook has it,

626
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:43,830
the rest of us haven't seen it.
No. Are Most of these people,

627
00:36:43,831 --> 00:36:47,760
is this mostly Facebook? Is it
mostly Twitter or where, what is,

628
00:36:47,761 --> 00:36:50,310
how does it break down?
Yeah, so there were, um,

629
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:52,920
here am I like little stats here cause
that would give you the wrong data.

630
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:57,870
There were 10 and a half million tweets
of which about 6 million were original

631
00:36:57,871 --> 00:37:01,890
content created by about 3,800 accounts.
Um,

632
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:07,200
there were about 133,
I me just read it,

633
00:37:07,201 --> 00:37:12,201
133 Instagram accounts with about 116,000
posts and then 81 Facebook pages and

634
00:37:14,611 --> 00:37:18,630
17 youtube channels with
about 1100, um, videos.

635
00:37:18,930 --> 00:37:23,930
And so they got about 200
million engagements on
Instagram and about another 75

636
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:28,560
million or so on Facebook. Um, engagements
are like, likes, shares, comments,

637
00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:31,710
reactions, you know, um, so

638
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:36,840
it's hard to contextualize what,
what we think happened, you know,

639
00:37:36,841 --> 00:37:39,300
you can go and you can try to look at,
um,

640
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:44,700
how well did this content perform
relative to other real authentic media

641
00:37:44,701 --> 00:37:45,990
targeting these communities.

642
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:50,760
And what you see with the black community
in particular is their Instagram game

643
00:37:50,761 --> 00:37:55,410
was really good. Um, they're, so
they're on their Instagram accounts,

644
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,980
the, you know, the top five, three of
them targeted the black community and got,

645
00:37:59,130 --> 00:38:03,240
you know, tens, 200
millions of engagements.

646
00:38:03,390 --> 00:38:08,070
So I would have to pull up
the exact numbers off the
top of my head. Yeah. It's,

647
00:38:08,071 --> 00:38:12,270
um, it's on Instagram. It's
all memes and then you know,

648
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:15,240
so we have the memes and then
we have the text on Instagram.

649
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,530
You can't really share.

650
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,560
So it's amazing that they got the
kind of engagement that they did.

651
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:22,200
Even without the sharing function.

652
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:26,560
One of the things you can do is if you
know the names of the accounts and there

653
00:38:27,050 --> 00:38:29,250
a lot of them are out there publicly now,
um,

654
00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:33,690
you can actually see them
in regram apps. So, uh,

655
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:37,540
people were regramming the content.
So Facebook says about 20 million people,

656
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:39,940
excuse me,
engaged with the Instagram content,

657
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:44,740
but what isn't included in that is all
of the re grams of the content that were

658
00:38:44,741 --> 00:38:46,240
shared by other accounts.

659
00:38:46,810 --> 00:38:51,070
So the spread and the dispersion of this.

660
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:53,410
It's an interesting,
uh,

661
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:57,160
interesting thing to try to quantify
because we have engagement data,

662
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:00,160
but we don't know,
did it change hearts and minds?

663
00:39:00,161 --> 00:39:04,450
We don't know if it influenced
people to go follow other accounts.

664
00:39:04,451 --> 00:39:07,720
We don't know if it influenced
people to not vote. Uh,

665
00:39:07,721 --> 00:39:10,890
there's just so much more,
I think still to,

666
00:39:11,090 --> 00:39:14,140
to understand about how these
operations work. Well, we can kind of,

667
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:17,180
we can assume that it had some
impact, right? I mean, yes, as,

668
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:20,940
as you were saying earlier, when a
new person enters into a conversation,

669
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:22,300
it changes the tone of it.

670
00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:26,920
How much of what they did was their own
original post and how much of it was

671
00:39:26,921 --> 00:39:28,840
commenting on other people's posts.

672
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:31,820
So I thought you're actually going
to ask a different thing there.

673
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:36,340
How much of it was then
repurposing our own posts, right.

674
00:39:36,341 --> 00:39:40,300
Repurposing real American content.
Um, did they do that as well? Yeah,

675
00:39:40,301 --> 00:39:42,850
tons of times. But let me, let me, uh,

676
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:47,290
so they created a lot of their own stuff,
particularly in the early days.

677
00:39:47,350 --> 00:39:49,270
And so you can actually read the Dataset.

678
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:52,630
And one of the things when we
started finding these posts,

679
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:57,690
I was struck by how sometimes it read
like Esl and then sometimes it red lake,

680
00:39:58,090 --> 00:40:02,020
perfect, flawless, um,
professional English.

681
00:40:02,350 --> 00:40:04,720
And then other times it read
like normal English vernacular.

682
00:40:04,721 --> 00:40:06,040
Just the way that we
would talk to each other.

683
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:10,060
And I started digging into what that was.

684
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:13,700
So when it was vernacular
English, when it was, when it,

685
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:17,260
when it read like fluent American
American English, it was, um,

686
00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:18,790
usually cribbed from somewhere else.

687
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:21,970
So they would go and they would find a
local news story from some obscure local

688
00:40:21,971 --> 00:40:25,870
paper and they would crib and then
they would paste that. And then,

689
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:29,680
so the Facebook posts would be that
cribbed a sentence from that article and

690
00:40:29,681 --> 00:40:31,050
then their meme,
ah,

691
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:34,080
maybe they would add a sentence underneath
it to give it some kind of context or

692
00:40:34,081 --> 00:40:38,350
angle. When they would write their own
stuff, you would see the sloppiness.

693
00:40:38,351 --> 00:40:43,330
That's where you could see, um, subject
verb agreement is not quite there. The,

694
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:44,213
you know,

695
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:48,580
ways in which like Russian possessives
are different than American possessives

696
00:40:48,581 --> 00:40:53,200
the slips there. Um, and then the
other thing was the really funny stuff,

697
00:40:53,201 --> 00:40:55,150
which was, um, you know,

698
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:58,570
a post that's supposed to supposedly
written by a Texas secessionist, right?

699
00:40:58,571 --> 00:41:01,690
So you can probably have an image of a
Texas secessionists in your mind as I say

700
00:41:01,691 --> 00:41:03,880
this. And it would be things like, um,

701
00:41:05,110 --> 00:41:09,190
Hillary Clinton is a terrible
individual and as a, uh,

702
00:41:09,191 --> 00:41:10,330
as a terrible individual,

703
00:41:10,331 --> 00:41:14,410
it's completely impossible for us to back
her in her candidacy for the American

704
00:41:14,411 --> 00:41:18,690
presidency. Furthermore, you know what
it's like, furthermore, air go, you know,

705
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:22,090
it is clear that, and I'm
like, it reads like memory.

706
00:41:22,091 --> 00:41:25,120
You're like in English in college or
something and you got to like write a

707
00:41:25,121 --> 00:41:28,900
formal essay. I was like, all right,

708
00:41:28,901 --> 00:41:31,320
so nobody actually talks like
that, especially not, you know,

709
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:36,020
your gear stereotypical Texas is
Ashiana. So it was funny seeing these,

710
00:41:36,021 --> 00:41:36,854
um,

711
00:41:36,950 --> 00:41:41,870
incongruities and that's unfortunately
one of the best ways to tell what you're

712
00:41:41,871 --> 00:41:45,960
dealing with is actually to kind of look
for those incongruities now and see ya

713
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:50,990
as you read communications
online, like, can, you know,

714
00:41:50,991 --> 00:41:55,070
does this,
does this read like an American,

715
00:41:55,071 --> 00:41:57,080
does this read like a communication?

716
00:41:57,081 --> 00:42:02,081
And what we started to see was one way
to not get caught for your lousy English

717
00:42:04,641 --> 00:42:08,450
or you're, you know, yeah.
How your cultural, um,

718
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:11,960
lack of, uh, kind of native, native, um,

719
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:16,370
abilities is to just repurpose
other people's stuff.

720
00:42:16,610 --> 00:42:20,520
And so that's where you would see
memes getting shared from, uh,

721
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:22,160
on both the right and the left.
You know,

722
00:42:22,161 --> 00:42:24,800
you'd see a lot of these like turning
point USA members that they were

723
00:42:24,801 --> 00:42:27,830
repurposing and pushing
out or you would see, um,

724
00:42:27,890 --> 00:42:30,500
occupied Democrats or the other 98%.

725
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:34,610
So memes from real American pages,

726
00:42:34,611 --> 00:42:35,870
real American culture.

727
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:39,800
And they would just sometimes slap a new
logo on and just repost it as if it was

728
00:42:39,801 --> 00:42:44,060
theirs. So it does in those
instances read just like, you know,

729
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:47,570
authentic American content. And in many
ways it is authentic American content.

730
00:42:47,990 --> 00:42:50,120
How many people were
working for this agency?

731
00:42:52,550 --> 00:42:54,980
I don't remember off the
top of my head. It was, um,

732
00:42:55,670 --> 00:42:57,440
somewhere between a couple
hundred, a thousand, I think.

733
00:42:57,441 --> 00:42:59,160
I don't know if it's bigger than that.
They're just,

734
00:42:59,270 --> 00:43:04,260
they just moved offices and um, it's
a funny story. I guess they, um,

735
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:09,400
moved offices and then people started
calling in bomb threats to the office and

736
00:43:10,851 --> 00:43:13,400
it was just like every day a new bomb
threat would get called on so they

737
00:43:13,401 --> 00:43:14,510
couldn't work.
Basically.

738
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:17,630
I assume this is like some American
intelligence agency just like fucking with

739
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:17,730
them,

740
00:43:17,730 --> 00:43:21,560
but just people calling in these bomb
threats to try to keep them from working.

741
00:43:21,561 --> 00:43:23,930
And I think,
um,

742
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:26,660
there was an article that came out
really recently that said that like army

743
00:43:26,661 --> 00:43:30,620
cyber or one of our, uh, one of
our agencies work to just like, um,

744
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:33,500
take them offline during the,
during the midterms,

745
00:43:34,110 --> 00:43:35,120
couple of days around the midterms.

746
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:38,380
I wonder if whoever's calling and then
is doing it and bad Russian. Yeah.

747
00:43:39,710 --> 00:43:42,140
Be So ironic because I was really funny,
like move to the right,

748
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:44,940
nice new office building on someone
chucked a Molotov cocktail through the

749
00:43:44,941 --> 00:43:47,460
window at some point. Like
of course, yeah, of course.

750
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:51,930
Versus spy. Yeah. I mean,

751
00:43:52,050 --> 00:43:56,460
it only makes sense that in this
bizarre and unpredictable and really

752
00:43:56,461 --> 00:43:59,820
unprotected, unprecedented
environment that we find ourselves in,

753
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,570
that something like this would come up
and just sort of throw a monkey wrench

754
00:44:03,571 --> 00:44:08,010
into the gears of,
of real conversation online.

755
00:44:08,011 --> 00:44:09,420
I mean it's,

756
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:14,100
it's a really amazing time in that
we're getting to see this kind of stuff

757
00:44:14,670 --> 00:44:17,640
happen in real time. We're,
we're getting to see these,

758
00:44:17,641 --> 00:44:22,530
these sort of weird attempts
at manipulating things.

759
00:44:22,531 --> 00:44:25,020
And I think in a lot of the successful,

760
00:44:25,021 --> 00:44:29,370
especially with less sophisticated
people that don't really understand that

761
00:44:29,371 --> 00:44:33,240
they're being trolled and that someone
fucking with them. And there's, it seems,

762
00:44:33,510 --> 00:44:34,230
I mean I've,

763
00:44:34,230 --> 00:44:38,520
there's a bunch of accounts that
I have bookmarked that I follow,

764
00:44:38,521 --> 00:44:41,360
but I don't follow.
So I don't follow them online lungs,

765
00:44:41,361 --> 00:44:43,830
I don't want them to know I'm following.
I'm going to just go to them.

766
00:44:43,831 --> 00:44:48,300
And some of them are so strange,
a few of them are flat earth accounts.

767
00:44:48,330 --> 00:44:51,780
This is something that I'm finding
the conspiracy theorists. Yes.

768
00:44:51,870 --> 00:44:55,440
And some of them literally have almost,
no,

769
00:44:55,441 --> 00:44:59,520
it's all memes and they don't say much.

770
00:44:59,550 --> 00:45:03,690
If anything underneath the memes
and I go to it, I'm like, what?

771
00:45:03,691 --> 00:45:05,580
What exactly are they doing here?

772
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:10,260
Like what exactly are they trying
to do with these? Because they just,

773
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:11,580
they're very weird.

774
00:45:12,110 --> 00:45:16,100
There was one that I came across,
um, I was looking at the, uh, the,

775
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:21,340
the conversation around Gmos and because
we have seen one of the things that

776
00:45:22,551 --> 00:45:26,630
Russia does besides the social bots and
the, you know, the amount, you know,

777
00:45:26,631 --> 00:45:30,230
screen with like Americans
directly, um, is the house.

778
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:32,240
So this was a Republican House
committee. The House, uh,

779
00:45:32,241 --> 00:45:35,870
science and technology committee about
a year ago said that they were seeing

780
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:37,370
evidence of,
um,

781
00:45:38,570 --> 00:45:42,460
both kind of overt propaganda
and then ways of, um,

782
00:45:42,590 --> 00:45:43,940
disseminating the propaganda.

783
00:45:44,090 --> 00:45:47,390
So there's always the dissemination and
then the account and then the content.

784
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:50,120
So it's like you look at three different
things to try to get a handle on

785
00:45:50,450 --> 00:45:53,300
whether or not this is real or fake.
Um,

786
00:45:53,330 --> 00:45:55,610
so when we talk about the
accounts we're looking at,

787
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:59,540
are they real people or they, you know,
automated, are they not automated?

788
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:03,570
When you're looking at the content,
you're usually looking at the domains. Um,

789
00:46:03,860 --> 00:46:05,180
and that's kind of the last piece,

790
00:46:05,181 --> 00:46:07,370
cause you don't want to have
any kind of bias get in there,

791
00:46:07,371 --> 00:46:11,570
but you're just trying to see is it
being pushed through like overt Russian

792
00:46:11,571 --> 00:46:14,300
propaganda domains,
like their think tanks and things.

793
00:46:14,301 --> 00:46:16,220
And then the third is the
dissemination pattern.

794
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,800
Is it being pushed out
through automated accounts?

795
00:46:18,830 --> 00:46:23,830
Is it spreading in ways that
look anomalous versus how
normal information would

796
00:46:23,871 --> 00:46:24,650
spread.

797
00:46:24,650 --> 00:46:28,460
So one of the things that the house
committee looked at was using that kind of

798
00:46:28,461 --> 00:46:32,090
rubric. Um, Russian, uh, you know,

799
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:34,110
these dubious,
um,

800
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:37,940
pieces of content and narratives
around American strategic industries.

801
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:43,070
So the energy industry, oil and
fracking for example, or the, um,

802
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:49,130
uh, you'd see a lot of stuff
with, um, Gmos and agriculture.
You know, this is very,

803
00:46:49,131 --> 00:46:53,150
his narrative of, um, you know, Putin
and Russia being the land of organic,

804
00:46:53,151 --> 00:46:57,710
plenty in the United States, a serving
it's people, toxic poisoned vegetables,

805
00:46:57,711 --> 00:47:00,590
this, the sort of stuff. And
meanwhile, at the same time,

806
00:47:00,591 --> 00:47:03,640
there's competition for who's
going to get the, you know,

807
00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:08,240
large contract to provide rice
to some part of the world. So,

808
00:47:08,241 --> 00:47:12,260
so there's like an economic motivation
underlying this, this kind of narrative.

809
00:47:12,770 --> 00:47:17,770
And I was looking at one of these accounts
and it was tweeting and article about

810
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:21,530
Hillary Clinton.
A vote for Hillary is a vote for Monsanto,

811
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:25,400
but it was tweeting this in, you know,
just like three months ago or something.

812
00:47:25,401 --> 00:47:29,620
It was like mid 2018 or late 2018
when I was at this. I'm like,

813
00:47:29,621 --> 00:47:33,820
well that ship sailed a long
time ago guys, why are we,
why are we tweeting about,

814
00:47:33,850 --> 00:47:36,670
you know, Hillary's vote just because
they just, they're just there to,

815
00:47:37,330 --> 00:47:39,520
it was written by a Russian think tank.
And so they're,

816
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:42,760
they just have these
automated accounts retweeting,

817
00:47:42,761 --> 00:47:46,990
repurposing this content from forever
ago. And it, it doesn't even make sense,

818
00:47:46,991 --> 00:47:50,740
it's just out there to amplify a
particular point of view or bump up, uh,

819
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:55,390
mentions of the site. What were they
trying to do with the Anti vaccine posts?

820
00:47:55,750 --> 00:47:57,640
Yeah, that was a, that
was an interesting thing.

821
00:47:57,641 --> 00:48:00,720
So I would say not much to be honest.
Um,

822
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:06,550
the,
there were 900,

823
00:48:06,551 --> 00:48:10,780
maybe 800, I think, um, tweets
about vaccines in the content.

824
00:48:11,230 --> 00:48:16,090
And so Facebook and Twitter,
you have this, uh, sorry,

825
00:48:16,091 --> 00:48:21,070
Facebook and Instagram. You have this
building up of tribes. Twitter you have,

826
00:48:21,220 --> 00:48:25,150
instead they're just talking
about whatever is popular, right?

827
00:48:25,151 --> 00:48:27,910
They're talking to her shit posting.
They're talking about whatever's current,

828
00:48:27,911 --> 00:48:31,450
new whatever scandal has just
broken anywhere. And you know, um,

829
00:48:31,510 --> 00:48:36,010
so Twitter is less about establishing
relationships and more about joining the

830
00:48:36,011 --> 00:48:40,540
conversation and nudging it.
And so most of the vaccine related posts,

831
00:48:40,541 --> 00:48:41,980
it was not a big theme for them.

832
00:48:41,981 --> 00:48:44,680
It wasn't something that was on like
Facebook and Instagram where that's where

833
00:48:44,681 --> 00:48:48,280
they're really leaning in. Like, this is
what we want Americans to think about.

834
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:51,850
So no mention of vaccines on those
platforms. Not on Youtube, on Twitter.

835
00:48:51,851 --> 00:48:56,540
You see it in 2015. Funny enough, during
the Disneyland measles outbreak, um,

836
00:48:56,800 --> 00:49:00,040
much like there's a whole
lot of conversation around
vaccines right now because

837
00:49:00,041 --> 00:49:02,650
of the outbreaks in
Washington in New York. Uh,

838
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:04,450
back in 2015 you saw the same thing,

839
00:49:04,540 --> 00:49:07,600
lots of conversations about measles
because the Disneyland thing that happened

840
00:49:07,601 --> 00:49:12,550
down here. And so they're in there and
they're saying, I'm vaccinate your kids.

841
00:49:12,551 --> 00:49:16,300
Don't vaccinate your kids. They had a
couple of conspiracy theorist accounts.

842
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:21,250
Um, I am trying to remember
the name. It was a,

843
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:26,020
it looked like a blonde woman. I
think it's name was Amy. Um, and uh,

844
00:49:26,021 --> 00:49:30,880
Amy was a, was a conspiracy
theorists. Amy was a fake person.

845
00:49:30,910 --> 00:49:34,540
Yeah. I wish I could remember
his Twitter account. Um,

846
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:40,410
God, what the Hell was her name?
She Wa Amy Black. Um, there,

847
00:49:40,420 --> 00:49:43,240
there are certain of the certain of their
personas actually got a lot of lift.

848
00:49:43,241 --> 00:49:46,630
There was one called Woke Louisa that
was a black woman. There was a, yeah,

849
00:49:46,631 --> 00:49:50,650
I mean they nail it right then
and there. They're not dumb. Um,

850
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:54,070
there was 10 GOP,
the fake Tennessee GOP page.

851
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:57,410
How much autonomy do you think these
people have that are creating these things

852
00:49:58,670 --> 00:50:02,680
are the, it sounds like some of them
are actually pretty funny. Yeah,

853
00:50:02,681 --> 00:50:05,440
they're funny. They're funny. That's why
they work. That's what everybody thinks.

854
00:50:05,441 --> 00:50:09,610
It's just like, you know, in competent
shit, it's not, it's actually really good.

855
00:50:09,611 --> 00:50:13,390
That's where that, that's, I
think the thing that, you know,

856
00:50:14,260 --> 00:50:17,860
even with, um, whatever, you know,

857
00:50:17,861 --> 00:50:19,960
political proclivities you may have,

858
00:50:19,961 --> 00:50:23,770
I think you can at least recognize humor
even if it's laughing at your side.

859
00:50:23,771 --> 00:50:28,640
And I will say that some of the
stuff, especially the, the right wing,

860
00:50:28,670 --> 00:50:31,580
you know, the right wing, like youth
kind of pages where they were funny,

861
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:35,210
they really work.
And it was,

862
00:50:35,870 --> 00:50:40,460
I think that is, people assume that
like they're too smart to fall for it.

863
00:50:41,150 --> 00:50:45,890
Um, it's just those liberals or it's
just those conservatives or you know, uh,

864
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:47,030
it's, it's really, it,

865
00:50:47,060 --> 00:50:51,920
it targets everybody and they
understand the psychology,

866
00:50:51,921 --> 00:50:52,731
the motivation,

867
00:50:52,731 --> 00:50:57,110
the narratives and the culture and
they produce the content accordingly.

868
00:50:57,410 --> 00:51:00,560
And I imagined that they had a grand old
time doing it because there were some

869
00:51:00,561 --> 00:51:04,670
stuff and, um, two narratives
that came out in 2017,

870
00:51:05,420 --> 00:51:09,830
um, the first was when Facebook
started to moderate their pages,

871
00:51:10,250 --> 00:51:12,860
they started to scream about
how Facebook was censoring them.

872
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:18,640
So the exact same narrative that you
see today about how any moderation is

873
00:51:18,801 --> 00:51:23,090
censorship. It's, you know, a picture of
like Zuckerberg. And it's like, nice page.

874
00:51:23,091 --> 00:51:25,220
You've got to be a shame if
anything happened to it, you know,

875
00:51:25,221 --> 00:51:27,650
and that's the meme that they're putting
out there when they're complaining that

876
00:51:27,651 --> 00:51:32,090
they're fake. Page got taken
down. Um, there was, uh,

877
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:35,600
tons and tons of these memes also about,
um,

878
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:40,550
the Russians did it mocking the
idea that the Russians did it. Uh,

879
00:51:40,551 --> 00:51:45,020
so this is as the story is beginning
to come out before we've had the tech

880
00:51:45,021 --> 00:51:47,750
hearings before we've had the Mueller
indictment's before we've had the

881
00:51:47,751 --> 00:51:51,740
investigation, you see these memes, um,

882
00:51:51,950 --> 00:51:54,230
where it's like, oh, my
speedometer was broken.

883
00:51:54,231 --> 00:51:57,350
It must've been the Russians
or picture of Hillary Clinton.

884
00:51:57,351 --> 00:51:59,930
And it's like a in a like little
golden book kind of thing.

885
00:51:59,931 --> 00:52:03,140
And it's like the whiny child's guide
to blaming Russia for your failures.

886
00:52:03,350 --> 00:52:04,820
You know, and it's, again, it's funny,

887
00:52:04,821 --> 00:52:08,030
like the stuff is funny and they're
like Metta trolling and you imagine them

888
00:52:08,031 --> 00:52:10,700
sitting there like, you know, they have
a picture of like some like, you know,

889
00:52:10,701 --> 00:52:13,400
buff guy carrying a gun and they're like,
I'm not a Russian troll man.

890
00:52:13,401 --> 00:52:16,880
I'm an American. Wow. Okay.

891
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:22,040
So you're looking at this and you're
like, it's just so spot on. And again,

892
00:52:22,041 --> 00:52:25,190
I can't see what the people commented
under it if they were like right on or if

893
00:52:25,191 --> 00:52:29,120
they were like, ah, this is bullshit.
But so that's where you get at the,

894
00:52:30,020 --> 00:52:33,530
they, it's, you know,
people think like, Oh,

895
00:52:33,531 --> 00:52:37,370
I'm too smart to fall for it, or Oh,
this is targeting those other people. No,

896
00:52:37,371 --> 00:52:39,530
it isn't. That's the
problem. It's just, um,

897
00:52:39,980 --> 00:52:42,980
it's going to target you with the thing
that you're most likely to be receptive

898
00:52:42,981 --> 00:52:47,981
to just because of psychological bias
and tribal affiliation and you're not

899
00:52:48,531 --> 00:52:49,700
sitting there thinking,

900
00:52:49,730 --> 00:52:54,380
how is this person who is purportedly
just like me screwing with me?

901
00:52:54,381 --> 00:52:55,850
And that's why,
uh,

902
00:52:55,910 --> 00:52:59,990
that's why it does manage to attract a
following and get retweeted, get reshared.

903
00:53:00,620 --> 00:53:02,900
Um,
it's good.

904
00:53:03,270 --> 00:53:06,540
Well, it's so clever because
it's so comprehensive.

905
00:53:06,541 --> 00:53:09,480
There's so much involved in it and the
fact that they're willing to do this for

906
00:53:09,481 --> 00:53:13,110
years and years before they really sort
of activate the political aspect of what

907
00:53:13,111 --> 00:53:15,180
they're trying to do. It also, it's,

908
00:53:15,181 --> 00:53:19,050
it's strange that they're so sophisticated
about our culture because we don't

909
00:53:19,051 --> 00:53:23,400
know a goddamn thing about Russia.
The average person knows Putin, bad,

910
00:53:23,730 --> 00:53:27,470
evil, warlord, Crimea, he
invade. You know, like we, we,

911
00:53:27,510 --> 00:53:31,050
we have like a four year olds
understanding. Like if you had a,

912
00:53:31,060 --> 00:53:34,030
if you just grabbed a person,
random person that's true,

913
00:53:34,031 --> 00:53:38,760
college educated person and ask them to
describe what's so bad about Russia. Wow.

914
00:53:38,761 --> 00:53:42,630
It's like communist over
there or something man. Me,
they fucking, they hate us.

915
00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:44,660
First of all,
they have bombs like this.

916
00:53:44,670 --> 00:53:46,830
There's so little
understanding of their culture,

917
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:49,860
but yet they know so much about hours.

918
00:53:50,340 --> 00:53:53,550
That's one of the weird things about
being an American. When you go,

919
00:53:53,580 --> 00:53:57,540
when you travel overseas and you realize
how much they know about our elections,

920
00:53:57,541 --> 00:53:58,374
how much they know,

921
00:53:58,380 --> 00:54:00,870
we don't even know who the fuck
there was running their country.

922
00:54:00,871 --> 00:54:02,160
We don't have any idea,

923
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:06,780
but they know about Trump and they know
that Hillary did this and they know that

924
00:54:06,781 --> 00:54:11,670
Bernie wants to give the money away. And
you know, it's, it's crazy. It's, it's,

925
00:54:11,671 --> 00:54:12,600
it's weird.

926
00:54:12,930 --> 00:54:17,610
And these people must have
like a deep education on, uh,

927
00:54:17,611 --> 00:54:22,110
American culture, American politics. Do
you think they're training these kids?

928
00:54:22,111 --> 00:54:22,530
Yeah,

929
00:54:22,530 --> 00:54:23,590
absolutely.
I would.

930
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:26,480
So they did a couple things that
came out in the Mueller indictment.

931
00:54:26,660 --> 00:54:27,291
First of all,

932
00:54:27,291 --> 00:54:29,780
a couple of people actually came here
and did a road trip around America.

933
00:54:30,590 --> 00:54:33,380
Oh. Literally just to
learn when to Texas? Yeah.

934
00:54:33,381 --> 00:54:38,280
Like basically telling me where you
keep the beef jerky. But that's a,

935
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:42,300
that was in the, uh, one of the, I
think the Mueller indictment of a,

936
00:54:42,330 --> 00:54:45,440
from February 28 teen,

937
00:54:45,950 --> 00:54:48,900
there've been three kind of big documents
that have come out to from eastern

938
00:54:48,901 --> 00:54:52,620
district and one from Mueller
on, um, on how it all worked out.

939
00:54:53,010 --> 00:54:57,120
I think another misconception is
this notion of $100,000 in ads.

940
00:54:57,330 --> 00:55:01,680
They spent $18 million in 2017,

941
00:55:01,681 --> 00:55:04,050
I believe was the stat that came out
during another one of the Mueller

942
00:55:04,051 --> 00:55:06,150
indictment's. So they're
not just, you know,

943
00:55:06,510 --> 00:55:08,970
the money's not just going for
the salaries and the ad buys.

944
00:55:08,971 --> 00:55:13,860
The money's also going for, um, they were
talking about using kind of consultants.

945
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:17,850
And this is where you get at this thing
that comes out during the standup or

946
00:55:17,851 --> 00:55:22,380
they're like black people who are LGBT
don't want to see white LGBT memes and,

947
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:26,670
and this degree of granularity,
the degree of sophistication.

948
00:55:26,671 --> 00:55:30,840
But then also what you see them doing is
engaging one on one and that's where it

949
00:55:30,841 --> 00:55:35,670
crosses the line from social media
operation to this as much more like,

950
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:40,260
uh, like spying. You want to watch the
Americans no idea. Oh, I love that show.

951
00:55:40,261 --> 00:55:42,960
You should definitely go to that. Great.
It's great. It's too many things to watch.

952
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:47,130
Totally. But what's
interesting is the, um, it,

953
00:55:47,270 --> 00:55:50,340
it does paint a pretty interesting
picture of like this, um,

954
00:55:50,370 --> 00:55:54,630
this couple under deep cover that are
engaging with and pretending to be

955
00:55:54,631 --> 00:55:55,920
Americans and forming relations.

956
00:55:55,980 --> 00:55:59,120
Jen, apparently it's based
loosely on real people. Yeah.

957
00:55:59,260 --> 00:56:02,400
That's what I've read also.
But what you see in the, um,

958
00:56:02,470 --> 00:56:05,940
in the Mueller indictment is the
text messages is the messenger,

959
00:56:05,980 --> 00:56:09,280
the Facebook messenger messages where
they're going back and forth with real

960
00:56:09,281 --> 00:56:13,870
activists and they're saying
things like, um, you know, hey,

961
00:56:13,871 --> 00:56:16,540
my ad account got shut down.
Can you run some ads for me

962
00:56:18,940 --> 00:56:23,010
or the, um, hey, I want
to help your protest. Um,

963
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:27,350
we're fellow black lives matter activists
and we see you're running a protest up

964
00:56:27,390 --> 00:56:31,750
and I think it was like
Ethica or something. Um,
Binghamton. How can we help you?

965
00:56:31,780 --> 00:56:36,160
We can give you some money for posters
and they're sending money for posters or

966
00:56:36,161 --> 00:56:38,710
they reach out to a Trump
supporter and they say like,

967
00:56:39,130 --> 00:56:43,210
we think it'd be really funny to have a
Hillary Clinton impersonator sitting in

968
00:56:43,211 --> 00:56:47,250
a truck flatbed truck that's made
up to look like a jail. Let us, um,

969
00:56:47,340 --> 00:56:50,200
and if we give you some money, will you
find the Hillary Clinton impersonator?

970
00:56:50,201 --> 00:56:54,100
And, um, put her in Jalan do
this Hillary for prison thing.

971
00:56:54,610 --> 00:56:57,440
And so this is where another
thing that they did was, um,

972
00:56:57,580 --> 00:57:02,580
using Facebook events to create real
world protests so they're not limiting it

973
00:57:04,211 --> 00:57:07,180
to shit, posting online and
making people feel tension online.

974
00:57:07,750 --> 00:57:11,830
They're actually sending people out
into the real world to have in street

975
00:57:11,831 --> 00:57:12,664
violence.

976
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:17,050
And so one of the things that they did
was they coordinated Facebook event, um,

977
00:57:17,140 --> 00:57:21,520
one for the Texas secessionist page.
And one for the,

978
00:57:21,521 --> 00:57:25,510
there was a pro Muslim called
United Muslims. And on the same day,

979
00:57:25,570 --> 00:57:30,430
at the same time in Texas,
they have a rally to support,

980
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:30,820
um,

981
00:57:30,820 --> 00:57:35,820
Texas culture and resist
the Islamicization of Texas
across the street from a

982
00:57:35,981 --> 00:57:40,120
rally to defend Muslim
culture. And so they, like,

983
00:57:40,121 --> 00:57:44,620
there's literally no, they just create
these Facebook events on these pages and,

984
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:47,380
and then they promote them with
ad dollars and other things. And,

985
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:51,340
and you literally, if you go and you look
at the Texas reporting from that day,

986
00:57:52,140 --> 00:57:54,790
um, I don't remember if
it was dozens or hundreds,

987
00:57:54,791 --> 00:57:59,110
but a sufficient number of people showed
up that they had literally on opposite

988
00:57:59,111 --> 00:58:00,160
sides of barricades,

989
00:58:00,161 --> 00:58:04,420
police officers in this center screaming
at each other because one group is

990
00:58:04,421 --> 00:58:06,730
there for the resists,
the Islamization of Texas,

991
00:58:06,731 --> 00:58:11,080
and the other group is there to like
defend Muslim culture. And so you get to,

992
00:58:11,140 --> 00:58:14,830
you know, two opposite sides
of the spectrum in the same
place at the same time.

993
00:58:14,831 --> 00:58:18,070
And you literally insight like
a mini riot. So they were there.

994
00:58:18,071 --> 00:58:21,320
There were about 81 of these
events where they were holding, um,

995
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:26,800
black lives matter style rallies for
victims of violence, police violence, um,

996
00:58:27,790 --> 00:58:31,630
memorials for people who were
killed by police officers. You know,

997
00:58:31,631 --> 00:58:33,910
things that real Americans would do,

998
00:58:34,300 --> 00:58:36,490
but this wasn't being done by
real Americans. And that's,

999
00:58:36,491 --> 00:58:41,380
that's the insidious thing, right? Is
how does, how does Facebook detect that?

1000
00:58:41,381 --> 00:58:42,310
How to,
you know,

1001
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:47,640
how to you when you see this come to
defend Texas culture and you're a diehard

1002
00:58:48,430 --> 00:58:53,050
proud Texan, you know, you're not thinking
like somebody in St Petersburg is, is,

1003
00:58:53,300 --> 00:58:55,930
is organizing this.
And that's the, I mean,

1004
00:58:56,740 --> 00:59:00,670
I think that the idea that
this was just some memes,

1005
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:03,070
um,
is just not,

1006
00:59:03,170 --> 00:59:08,170
it doesn't respect the significance
of what they were trying to do and how

1007
00:59:09,701 --> 00:59:13,570
effective that they were with these
other things where even if they're just

1008
00:59:13,571 --> 00:59:16,540
trying it out just a little bit,
just working to see what works.

1009
00:59:16,780 --> 00:59:18,160
They're always experimenting.

1010
00:59:18,161 --> 00:59:22,100
They're always trying to find
ways to create that tension. Um,

1011
00:59:22,190 --> 00:59:25,340
and that's the thing that I think
is so interesting about this, right?

1012
00:59:25,341 --> 00:59:29,900
This evolving, this idea of an information
war where these tactics evolve,

1013
00:59:30,290 --> 00:59:31,040
um,

1014
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:34,640
and you are really at a disadvantage
when it comes to actually detecting them.

1015
00:59:35,250 --> 00:59:38,340
Yeah. And on the outside, if you're
looking at that, you'd say, well, okay,

1016
00:59:38,341 --> 00:59:39,660
what is their objective?

1017
00:59:39,810 --> 00:59:44,310
Why would they have this Texas a session
as page across or rally across the

1018
00:59:44,311 --> 00:59:48,000
street from a pro Islam rally?
Why would they do that? You know,

1019
00:59:48,001 --> 00:59:48,990
if you're on the outside,

1020
00:59:48,991 --> 00:59:51,780
you think about the amount of effort
that's involved in doing something like

1021
00:59:51,781 --> 00:59:55,290
this and they are also doing
this with no leaders, right.

1022
00:59:55,291 --> 00:59:57,760
There's no one there that's running
it when they get there. Yeah.

1023
00:59:57,870 --> 01:00:01,860
So all the pro Texas people go
here we are looking over there.

1024
01:00:01,890 --> 01:00:05,610
So mother fucking enemy.
I think

1025
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:10,000
couple times there were comments,
um,

1026
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:13,400
on some of the like archived pages
and things where you could see the

1027
01:00:13,401 --> 01:00:17,720
screenshots of people being like, Dude,
you hell, it has all come out there.

1028
01:00:17,721 --> 01:00:18,980
And like nobody showed up.

1029
01:00:19,090 --> 01:00:22,240
Right. Who is in charge? You know,

1030
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:25,680
they're probably throwing a lot of
things against the wall hoping that

1031
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:28,270
seven something stacks. Will
you see this on the, um,

1032
01:00:28,300 --> 01:00:33,250
there was a page called black matters
and black matters was interesting cause

1033
01:00:33,251 --> 01:00:36,550
they went and made a whole website.
So they made a website, black matters,

1034
01:00:36,551 --> 01:00:40,840
you ask.com, which I think is
still active. It's dormant.

1035
01:00:40,841 --> 01:00:44,230
They're not updating it, but I believe
that you can go in and read it. Um,

1036
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:48,130
and it was designed to call attention
to police brutality type things.

1037
01:00:49,070 --> 01:00:49,990
And so they had this black manners.

1038
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,660
You ask page and then there's
the black matters Facebook page,

1039
01:00:52,661 --> 01:00:55,450
the Twitter account, the Instagram
page, the youtube channel,

1040
01:00:55,570 --> 01:00:59,410
the soundcloud podcast,
the tumbler,

1041
01:00:59,411 --> 01:01:00,910
the Facebook stickers.

1042
01:01:01,110 --> 01:01:04,630
They had Facebook stickers that look like
little black panthers. Like little, um,

1043
01:01:04,990 --> 01:01:07,750
little cats. Yeah, a little black
cats. They were actually really cute,

1044
01:01:07,751 --> 01:01:09,430
very well done.
Um,

1045
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:13,570
so you have this entire fake media
ecosystem that they've just created out of

1046
01:01:13,571 --> 01:01:14,800
whole cloth,
all theirs.

1047
01:01:15,460 --> 01:01:18,100
And then what they start to do
is they start to put up job ads.

1048
01:01:18,970 --> 01:01:23,860
And so it's Cumbia designer for us.
Come be a, uh, come write for us,

1049
01:01:23,861 --> 01:01:27,520
come photograph our
protests come, um, you know,

1050
01:01:27,530 --> 01:01:32,350
they have like a kind of like, um, black,
I dressed in a cool outfit like hipster,

1051
01:01:32,410 --> 01:01:34,890
you know, holding a sign,
like join black matters. Um,

1052
01:01:35,140 --> 01:01:37,780
you see them go through a couple of
different logos the same way you would if

1053
01:01:37,781 --> 01:01:40,470
you were starting a, you
know, a media brand. Um,

1054
01:01:41,290 --> 01:01:44,170
they start posting ads for,
do you want to be a calendar girl?

1055
01:01:44,171 --> 01:01:48,010
Send us your photos and do you want
to be on a black reality TV show,

1056
01:01:48,011 --> 01:01:52,330
send us video clips of
you. Um, do you like,

1057
01:01:52,420 --> 01:01:57,420
they begin to do real work to ingratiate
themselves with the community that a

1058
01:01:58,461 --> 01:02:03,370
physical fitness thing. It
was called black fest. And
the idea was that it was, um,

1059
01:02:04,510 --> 01:02:07,210
kind of vaguely militant task.
Um,

1060
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:11,650
and that it was supposed to teach a
black people how to handle themselves at

1061
01:02:11,710 --> 01:02:14,320
protests. Should there be police
violence had a fight back.

1062
01:02:15,070 --> 01:02:19,000
And they actually went and found a guy,
a physical fitness, you know, martial

1063
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:23,970
guy, and they were paying
him via paypal. So, so,

1064
01:02:24,210 --> 01:02:28,670
so he was running classes for the black
community under this black fist, um,

1065
01:02:28,860 --> 01:02:33,120
brand.
And they would like text him or call him.

1066
01:02:33,390 --> 01:02:36,230
He played some of the voicemails
on TV. Actually I heard them, um,

1067
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:41,250
after my report came out,
I think they tracked him down and um,

1068
01:02:41,610 --> 01:02:44,540
and he just talks about how they,
yeah, they just pay pal them, you know,

1069
01:02:44,550 --> 01:02:47,550
a couple hundred bucks. Every time you
run a fitness class, the voicemails,

1070
01:02:47,551 --> 01:02:51,620
like it was a little
concerned.

1071
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:55,530
The police say you'd, you'd
be, you'd be surprised.

1072
01:02:55,530 --> 01:02:59,640
They actually had a youtube channel with
two black men named Williams and Calvin.

1073
01:03:00,450 --> 01:03:04,760
And there was this channel, Williams
and Calvin and actual book actual, yeah,

1074
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:10,320
they hired these guys to
be a fake youtube channel.

1075
01:03:10,530 --> 01:03:15,210
Um, and it was a, it was called a word of
truth, I think was what the name of it.

1076
01:03:15,211 --> 01:03:18,350
And so Williams and Calvin
and these two guys would, um,

1077
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:23,130
would give their word of truth and
their word of truth was usually about,

1078
01:03:23,131 --> 01:03:25,730
you know, how fucked up America
is, which I mean, there,

1079
01:03:25,731 --> 01:03:28,650
there are very real grievances underlying
all of this. And that's the problem,

1080
01:03:28,651 --> 01:03:31,170
right? They have things to exploit. Um,

1081
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:36,030
and writing these things for these
gentlemen. I imagine. I mean,

1082
01:03:36,031 --> 01:03:39,180
imagine they were definitely paying
them and they organize the channel seems

1083
01:03:39,181 --> 01:03:42,000
likely channels organized. Yeah.
All that. That particular one,

1084
01:03:42,001 --> 01:03:44,460
I think that they were actually,
they were in on it.

1085
01:03:44,460 --> 01:03:47,020
They knew what they
were doing that because

1086
01:03:48,870 --> 01:03:53,850
one of the guys who was in that channel
popped up again in 2018 right before the

1087
01:03:53,851 --> 01:03:56,280
midterms.
Like maybe even the day before.

1088
01:03:56,281 --> 01:03:58,590
I'm trying to remember the timeline here.
Um,

1089
01:03:58,710 --> 01:04:02,850
and he made a different video saying
he wanted to, this was amazing,

1090
01:04:03,060 --> 01:04:06,540
saying he wanted to leave the internet
research agency kind of. So he was saying,

1091
01:04:06,570 --> 01:04:11,310
um, basically, um, I'm
tired of doing this work.

1092
01:04:11,700 --> 01:04:13,230
I want to,
I want to do a leak.

1093
01:04:13,231 --> 01:04:16,110
I want to show you all of the things that
the Internet research agency has done.

1094
01:04:16,111 --> 01:04:18,150
And so they actually put out this.

1095
01:04:18,540 --> 01:04:21,180
So this guy who had been in
the Williams and Calvin video,

1096
01:04:21,181 --> 01:04:26,181
so people recognize his face in the
2018 midterms goes and says he wants to

1097
01:04:26,911 --> 01:04:31,500
leave and he's going to leak
all this information and sorry,

1098
01:04:31,501 --> 01:04:35,840
this damn cough.
And he wants to to like confess.

1099
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:39,120
I don't remember all the specifics because
it was right before my thing came out

1100
01:04:39,121 --> 01:04:41,850
and I was so busy
working. But um, but yeah,

1101
01:04:41,851 --> 01:04:46,851
he pops up again and he is saying he like
wants to expose the truth and I think

1102
01:04:48,060 --> 01:04:51,420
most people didn't cover it,
didn't pay attention. Youtube,

1103
01:04:51,421 --> 01:04:55,320
shut down the channel and deleted the
video immediately. Um, why they do that?

1104
01:04:56,010 --> 01:04:58,620
I think that it was seen as another
influence operation. You know,

1105
01:04:58,621 --> 01:05:00,480
you don't trust the,
um,

1106
01:05:00,970 --> 01:05:05,970
so even intention that he's going to
expose it was probably just another level.

1107
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:11,370
Well, what wound up coming out, this
was, this is so convoluted. I'm sorry.

1108
01:05:11,371 --> 01:05:15,030
I know it's like hard to
explain without visuals. Um,

1109
01:05:15,150 --> 01:05:17,860
what they wound up doing was
they did drop a bunch of docs.

1110
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:22,240
So they did release a pile of documents
in which they claimed they actually

1111
01:05:22,241 --> 01:05:24,970
hacked the Mueller investigation.
Mueller had nothing.

1112
01:05:25,900 --> 01:05:29,580
And so this is again, another kind of, um,

1113
01:05:29,980 --> 01:05:33,370
convoluted piece of this where
they do release information.

1114
01:05:33,371 --> 01:05:35,710
And so in this particular example,

1115
01:05:35,711 --> 01:05:39,190
they release information that we
believe they actually got through legal

1116
01:05:39,191 --> 01:05:40,024
discovery.

1117
01:05:40,270 --> 01:05:44,080
So the documents that the investigation
provided to one of the indicted Russians

1118
01:05:44,081 --> 01:05:47,920
were the documents that they then leaked
claiming they had hacked the Mueller

1119
01:05:47,921 --> 01:05:52,780
investigation. So they're constantly
doing these things to generate press,

1120
01:05:52,781 --> 01:05:57,100
generate attention, create just that
degree of people don't know what's real.

1121
01:05:57,460 --> 01:05:58,060
Um,

1122
01:05:58,060 --> 01:06:03,060
or they read the headlines that are then
released by the more propagandist overt

1123
01:06:03,341 --> 01:06:08,110
Russian propaganda. And they think that
that is the true story, that, that, that,

1124
01:06:08,111 --> 01:06:10,870
that is, um, that, that the Russians
hacked the Mueller investigation.

1125
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:16,360
So there's always this, um, how do we
create fear, uncertainty and doubt?

1126
01:06:16,450 --> 01:06:17,710
How do we throw people off?

1127
01:06:17,770 --> 01:06:22,390
How do we come up with these extremely
convoluted spy games that leave people

1128
01:06:22,391 --> 01:06:26,440
feeling unbalanced, that make
people wonder what they can trust,

1129
01:06:26,441 --> 01:06:30,130
who they can trust and what's real. And
even as somebody who looks at this stuff,

1130
01:06:30,131 --> 01:06:34,300
you know, day in and day
out for years, um, I,

1131
01:06:35,360 --> 01:06:39,130
I do still regularly get surprised by the,
uh,

1132
01:06:39,580 --> 01:06:43,840
by the sheer kind of ballsiness
and ingenuity of, of, of, you know,

1133
01:06:44,230 --> 01:06:46,360
some of the stuff is it
as it comes to light?

1134
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:46,991
Well,

1135
01:06:46,991 --> 01:06:51,991
it's really fascinating that they went
so far as to hire people to make a fake

1136
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:57,960
account on youtube and hired these black
guys to pretend that they're doing that

1137
01:06:58,301 --> 01:07:01,270
on their own and they're really
being hired by the Russians.

1138
01:07:02,080 --> 01:07:05,590
And then when the guys leave, you don't
know if they really did leave. Yeah.

1139
01:07:05,830 --> 01:07:09,110
You don't know if this is just
more bullshit. It's like in,

1140
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:12,730
like you were saying earlier, if they
get you and you buy into it, hook,

1141
01:07:12,731 --> 01:07:15,610
line and sinker, they win. If
they get you to think, well,

1142
01:07:15,611 --> 01:07:18,370
how much else is bullshit?
They still went, Yup.

1143
01:07:18,460 --> 01:07:22,540
Because you're looking at everything
with sort of this tainted lens now

1144
01:07:22,840 --> 01:07:23,673
everything seemed,

1145
01:07:23,830 --> 01:07:28,830
and the sense that's probably the ultimate
goal is to disrupt our social media

1146
01:07:30,281 --> 01:07:33,400
environment and to sort of hijack the,

1147
01:07:33,640 --> 01:07:36,850
the natural conversations
that are taking place.

1148
01:07:37,170 --> 01:07:40,860
Yeah. And I think it's, I mean, it's
effective. There's certain, you know,

1149
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:43,620
I was in Estonia last year,
um,

1150
01:07:44,040 --> 01:07:46,200
and they've been targeted by
this stuff for decades now,

1151
01:07:46,560 --> 01:07:48,720
have a 25% Russian speaking population.

1152
01:07:48,721 --> 01:07:52,020
And most of the news that they get is
from Russian media, right. You know,

1153
01:07:52,021 --> 01:07:53,730
right on the border.
Um,

1154
01:07:53,790 --> 01:07:58,790
they talk a lot about the
extreme commitment to educating
their citizens to make

1155
01:08:01,891 --> 01:08:03,570
them realize that this
kind of thing does happen.

1156
01:08:04,350 --> 01:08:09,030
This is what it usually looks like.
Um, don't share it here. You know,

1157
01:08:09,130 --> 01:08:10,830
just ignore it.
Let it go by.

1158
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:14,190
And I don't think we're quite there yet.

1159
01:08:14,700 --> 01:08:19,370
I think there's still plenty of people
in the country who don't believe it

1160
01:08:19,371 --> 01:08:20,630
happened.
Um,

1161
01:08:21,140 --> 01:08:26,140
or for some reason are completely
incapable of separating the Russian social

1162
01:08:28,191 --> 01:08:33,170
media influence campaign happened from
it means Donald Trump's election is a

1163
01:08:33,171 --> 01:08:35,810
legitimate, or it means
Donald Trump colluded, right?

1164
01:08:35,810 --> 01:08:39,710
Those are very different statements that
you don't have to collude in order for

1165
01:08:39,711 --> 01:08:43,820
someone somewhere to unsolicited
go and support your candidacy.

1166
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:47,570
So you can believe two
things simultaneously. One,

1167
01:08:47,571 --> 01:08:51,290
that Trump did not collude and that his
election is perfectly legitimate and

1168
01:08:51,291 --> 01:08:55,880
that this had no impact and to that it
still happened. And that I think is, um,

1169
01:08:56,150 --> 01:09:01,150
I am consistently amazed when I read
my social media mentions it at how hard

1170
01:09:03,381 --> 01:09:06,650
that ability to hold those
two ideas is for, for people.

1171
01:09:06,651 --> 01:09:09,500
They just believe that if
they're supporters of Trump,

1172
01:09:10,070 --> 01:09:14,360
they absolutely cannot acknowledge
that this operation took place.

1173
01:09:15,020 --> 01:09:19,700
And I, or if they are passionate
supporters of the far left,

1174
01:09:20,150 --> 01:09:24,050
um, it's more of like an
equivocation, you know? Well,

1175
01:09:24,051 --> 01:09:26,840
we don't really know if they did it
well. The rest us bad things too. Well,

1176
01:09:26,841 --> 01:09:31,100
how do we know? You know,
so that's where, um, it, it,

1177
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:34,340
it plays out very differently depending
on which part of the political spectrum

1178
01:09:34,341 --> 01:09:38,980
you sit on. Well, it
falls right into our, the

1179
01:09:38,980 --> 01:09:40,870
issue that we have with
cognitive dissonance.

1180
01:09:41,250 --> 01:09:43,630
If we believe in someone or
if we want someone to win,

1181
01:09:43,631 --> 01:09:48,550
especially if it's our team or our person
or on our side, you know, like I, I,

1182
01:09:49,060 --> 01:09:49,361
yeah,

1183
01:09:49,361 --> 01:09:54,361
I saw a lot of this when Donna Brazil
released her book detailing how the DNC

1184
01:09:55,691 --> 01:10:00,340
sort of rigged the primaries against
Bernie Sanders and, and, and for Clinton,

1185
01:10:00,341 --> 01:10:01,750
there was so many people
that were Clinton supporters.

1186
01:10:01,751 --> 01:10:03,700
It just didn't want to
believe it. I was like, well,

1187
01:10:03,701 --> 01:10:05,110
why wouldn't you believe this woman?

1188
01:10:05,140 --> 01:10:07,960
Like you believed her before when she
was supporting Clinton and then when she

1189
01:10:07,961 --> 01:10:11,590
leaves now you know, you won't believe
her. It's because it's inconvenient.

1190
01:10:11,830 --> 01:10:15,310
And we were real weird in our binary view.

1191
01:10:15,610 --> 01:10:19,990
We want things to be good or bad.
It was one or zero. This is it.

1192
01:10:20,160 --> 01:10:23,770
And this is a super complex issue.

1193
01:10:24,160 --> 01:10:28,120
It seems like they've been doing this
for a long time and they've gotten really

1194
01:10:28,121 --> 01:10:29,200
sophisticated at it.

1195
01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:31,990
And I think there's a lot of people that
have been sucked into it that have no

1196
01:10:31,991 --> 01:10:33,960
idea that it's actually
influenced the way they've,

1197
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:37,240
they've formed their own opinions.
This is where it gets really strange.

1198
01:10:37,241 --> 01:10:41,410
People are so malleable and
they're so easily manipulated.

1199
01:10:41,650 --> 01:10:46,450
Many people are that something like this,
like a real good solid,

1200
01:10:46,451 --> 01:10:51,451
concentrated effort to try to target
these groups that have these very specific

1201
01:10:52,091 --> 01:10:57,091
interests and really dig in
and form roots and then go out.

1202
01:10:57,610 --> 01:11:00,220
I mean, it's so sophisticated.
They're their approaches.

1203
01:11:00,990 --> 01:11:05,000
I'm on one hand horrified and the
other hand deeply impressed. Yep.

1204
01:11:05,740 --> 01:11:06,573
Me Too.

1205
01:11:07,570 --> 01:11:12,190
Now was this freaking you out when you
had to like go over all these memes and

1206
01:11:12,191 --> 01:11:13,650
you were actually laughing them

1207
01:11:14,070 --> 01:11:17,880
and you're like, God
damn it. Well, you know,

1208
01:11:17,881 --> 01:11:20,250
there's the tweet that goes
around every now and then.

1209
01:11:20,460 --> 01:11:23,480
You don't have to hand it to them.
And I'm always like, ah, how do I, um,

1210
01:11:24,300 --> 01:11:27,510
how do I properly convey, uh, um,

1211
01:11:27,990 --> 01:11:32,160
recognition for the,
you know,

1212
01:11:32,161 --> 01:11:35,580
I don't think we do ourselves any favors
by pretending it all sucked and didn't

1213
01:11:35,581 --> 01:11:36,580
matter in they're incompetent.

1214
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:39,960
I think that you have to acknowledge
that you have a sophisticated adversary

1215
01:11:40,410 --> 01:11:44,870
that is very capable. They're
very determined, that is
constantly evolving. Um,

1216
01:11:45,090 --> 01:11:48,000
and to treat that with the
degree of respect it deserves.

1217
01:11:48,120 --> 01:11:52,620
I think that that's just
common sense actually. Um, I,

1218
01:11:54,450 --> 01:11:59,400
I, I read media on both sides of
the aisle and I, I, you know, um,

1219
01:11:59,970 --> 01:12:03,720
I feel I try to stay current actually
on what memes are percolating in lots of

1220
01:12:03,721 --> 01:12:07,380
different spaces and part just because
I am always curious about what's organic

1221
01:12:07,381 --> 01:12:11,790
versus what seems to be disproportionately
amplified or what new communities are

1222
01:12:11,791 --> 01:12:12,930
popping up.
I just think it's an,

1223
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:17,640
I think be spread of information
among people is just very interesting.

1224
01:12:18,090 --> 01:12:19,740
You know, it's, it's something
that interests me a lot.

1225
01:12:19,741 --> 01:12:21,840
I think crowd psychology
is really interesting.

1226
01:12:21,990 --> 01:12:26,220
I think ways that crowd psychology has
transformed as the Internet has kind of

1227
01:12:26,221 --> 01:12:27,120
come into being,

1228
01:12:29,220 --> 01:12:32,460
particularly with things
like the mass consolidation,

1229
01:12:32,700 --> 01:12:34,650
the ease with which we can target people.
You know,

1230
01:12:34,651 --> 01:12:38,760
we didn't even really talk about that.
But the, um, one of the things with,

1231
01:12:39,190 --> 01:12:41,100
there's all, you know, even
in the decentralized Internet,

1232
01:12:41,101 --> 01:12:44,860
there's always been propaganda. There's
always been crazy conspiracy theories,

1233
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:45,690
all this stuff.

1234
01:12:45,690 --> 01:12:48,960
But it's that you can reach the people
who are likely to be receptive to it now

1235
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:53,670
and as people self select into tribes,
particularly in this country right now.

1236
01:12:54,150 --> 01:12:54,983
Um,

1237
01:12:55,170 --> 01:12:59,340
one of the things that's remarkable
is the way in which once you've self

1238
01:12:59,341 --> 01:13:02,880
selected into that tribe and this is the
media in your ecosystem and you share

1239
01:13:02,881 --> 01:13:05,970
it with your friends and Facebook and
that the people who see it are the people

1240
01:13:05,971 --> 01:13:07,650
who are most likely to be receptive to it.

1241
01:13:07,890 --> 01:13:11,490
Where if you run the ad
targeting you directly, you know,

1242
01:13:11,550 --> 01:13:14,040
send it into the feeds of people
most likely to be receptive to it.

1243
01:13:14,550 --> 01:13:19,550
We have this interesting phenomenon where
consolidation targeting and then these

1244
01:13:19,771 --> 01:13:24,771
gainable algorithms mean that it's
just this kind of information goes way

1245
01:13:26,311 --> 01:13:28,800
farther away,
faster than it ever could in the past,

1246
01:13:28,801 --> 01:13:33,580
regardless of whether it's
Russia pushing it or, um,

1247
01:13:33,630 --> 01:13:38,140
Iran as we've seen a, you know, a network
of Iranian pages went down recently. Um,

1248
01:13:38,190 --> 01:13:39,450
we see this globally now.

1249
01:13:40,230 --> 01:13:45,030
We see countries targeting their own
people with it and it's just this is the

1250
01:13:45,060 --> 01:13:47,610
information ecosystem.

1251
01:13:47,611 --> 01:13:51,360
This is like the new
infrastructure for speech at it.

1252
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:56,820
Sorry. Privileges this kind
of sensationalist content.
Yeah. Do you have hopes?

1253
01:13:56,821 --> 01:13:57,654
Would be great.

1254
01:14:04,260 --> 01:14:08,070
Don't feel bad. Um, who's,

1255
01:14:08,130 --> 01:14:12,400
who's seen all this stuff?
I mean, has, obviously

1256
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:15,310
Facebook has a check this out.

1257
01:14:15,640 --> 01:14:17,470
I'm sure Twitter's aware.

1258
01:14:18,130 --> 01:14:21,700
What has their reaction been and is
there any sort of a concerted effort to

1259
01:14:21,701 --> 01:14:24,910
mitigate some of the, some of the
impact of these these sites have?

1260
01:14:25,040 --> 01:14:29,930
Yeah, lots of it actually.
So I think, um, in,

1261
01:14:33,130 --> 01:14:38,130
in 2017 was when we started,

1262
01:14:39,470 --> 01:14:41,120
like we being independent researchers,

1263
01:14:41,121 --> 01:14:45,260
I guess people on the outside
of the company's academics, um,

1264
01:14:45,470 --> 01:14:48,290
began to find the content,
you know,

1265
01:14:48,291 --> 01:14:52,640
really began to investigative journalists
would identify the name of a page and

1266
01:14:52,641 --> 01:14:55,670
then me and people like me would go and
we would scour the Internet looking for

1267
01:14:55,730 --> 01:14:59,810
evidence of what was on that page. So I
found a bunch of the stuff on Pinterest,

1268
01:14:59,811 --> 01:15:04,330
for example, wrote about it. Um, guy
by the name of Jonathan Albright, uh,

1269
01:15:04,340 --> 01:15:05,930
found a crowdtangle data cache.

1270
01:15:06,050 --> 01:15:09,170
And with that we got the names of a
bunch more pages, bunch more posts,

1271
01:15:09,171 --> 01:15:12,170
and we had some really interesting
stuff to work with. Originally.

1272
01:15:12,171 --> 01:15:15,170
The platforms were very resistant
to the idea that this had happened.

1273
01:15:16,820 --> 01:15:21,500
And so as a result of that, they were, um,

1274
01:15:23,720 --> 01:15:26,000
in, you know, there was a,

1275
01:15:26,010 --> 01:15:31,010
the first thing that Zach said in
2016 when Trump gets elected Twitter,

1276
01:15:32,061 --> 01:15:36,410
it goes crazy that night with people
who work at Twitter saying, oh my God,

1277
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:40,830
where are we responsible for this? Which
is very silicon valley thing to say. Um,

1278
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:44,900
but what I think they meant by that was
their platform had been implicated as

1279
01:15:44,901 --> 01:15:48,710
hosting Russian bots and fake news and
harassment mobs and a number of other

1280
01:15:48,711 --> 01:15:49,071
things.

1281
01:15:49,071 --> 01:15:51,380
And there was always the sense that
it didn't have an impact and it didn't

1282
01:15:51,381 --> 01:15:55,400
matter. And so this was the first time
that they started to ask the question,

1283
01:15:55,401 --> 01:15:59,820
did it matter? And then Zach
made that statement. Um,

1284
01:15:59,900 --> 01:16:02,720
fake news is a very small percentage
of, you know, whatever on Facebook,

1285
01:16:02,721 --> 01:16:06,260
the amount of information on Facebook
and the idea that it could have swung on

1286
01:16:06,261 --> 01:16:10,190
election was ludicrous.
So you have the platforms,

1287
01:16:10,460 --> 01:16:15,460
kind of the leaders at the platforms
digging in and saying it's inconceivable

1288
01:16:16,251 --> 01:16:19,310
that, that, that this, you
know, could have happened.

1289
01:16:20,100 --> 01:16:25,100
And as the research and the discovery
begins to take place over the next nine

1290
01:16:25,551 --> 01:16:30,180
months or so, you, you, you get to
the one the tech hearings happen.

1291
01:16:30,180 --> 01:16:34,460
So I worked with, um, high by
the name of Tristan Harris.

1292
01:16:34,461 --> 01:16:39,290
He's the one who introduced
me to Sam. Um, and he,

1293
01:16:40,010 --> 01:16:44,840
he and I started going to DC with a
third fellow, Roger Mcnamee and saying,

1294
01:16:44,841 --> 01:16:46,760
Hey,
there's so much,

1295
01:16:46,790 --> 01:16:51,380
there's this body of evidence that's
coming out here and we need to have a

1296
01:16:51,381 --> 01:16:52,214
hearing.

1297
01:16:52,310 --> 01:16:56,840
We need to have congress ask the tech
companies to account for what happened,

1298
01:16:57,350 --> 01:16:59,240
to tell the American people what happened.

1299
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:02,270
Because what we're seeing
here as outside researchers,

1300
01:17:03,050 --> 01:17:05,000
what investigative
journalists are writing,

1301
01:17:05,450 --> 01:17:09,020
the things that we're finding just
don't line up with the statements that,

1302
01:17:09,170 --> 01:17:11,360
that nothing happened.
And this was all no big deal.

1303
01:17:11,900 --> 01:17:16,520
And so we start asking for
these hearings and actually,

1304
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:21,200
um, myself and a couple of others then
began asking them in the course of these

1305
01:17:21,201 --> 01:17:23,930
hearings,
can you get them to give you the data?

1306
01:17:24,110 --> 01:17:25,970
Because the platform's
hadn't given the data.

1307
01:17:26,240 --> 01:17:31,160
So it was that lobbying by concerned
citizens and journalists and researchers

1308
01:17:31,161 --> 01:17:33,650
saying,
we have to have some accountability here.

1309
01:17:33,651 --> 01:17:36,080
We have to have the platforms
account for what happened.

1310
01:17:36,290 --> 01:17:38,690
They have to tell people,
um,

1311
01:17:38,870 --> 01:17:42,290
because it had become such a politically
divisive issue. Did it even happen?

1312
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:47,800
And we felt like having them actually sit
there in front of Congress and account

1313
01:17:47,811 --> 01:17:51,740
for it would be the first step towards,
um,

1314
01:17:52,370 --> 01:17:54,590
towards moving forward in a
way, but, but also towards

1315
01:17:56,090 --> 01:17:59,870
changing the minds of the public and
making them realize that what happened on

1316
01:17:59,871 --> 01:18:01,670
social platforms matters.

1317
01:18:02,540 --> 01:18:06,720
And it was,
it was really interesting to,

1318
01:18:06,830 --> 01:18:10,340
to be part of that as
it, as it played out. Um,

1319
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,580
because one of the things that
Senator Blumenthal, one of the,

1320
01:18:13,610 --> 01:18:15,520
one of the senators said
was actually said, um,

1321
01:18:16,190 --> 01:18:18,980
Facebook and Twitter have to notify
people who engage with this content.

1322
01:18:19,370 --> 01:18:22,580
And so they are, there
was this idea that, um,

1323
01:18:23,810 --> 01:18:28,190
if you are engaging with
propagandas content, you
should have the right to know.

1324
01:18:28,730 --> 01:18:30,830
And so they started to push messages,
Twitter,

1325
01:18:30,831 --> 01:18:34,320
send out these emails to all these people,
um,

1326
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:37,770
saying you engaged with
this Russian troll. And, um,

1327
01:18:38,540 --> 01:18:41,510
Facebook created a little field,

1328
01:18:41,630 --> 01:18:45,260
a little little page that told people if
they had liked or followed a troll page.

1329
01:18:45,740 --> 01:18:50,540
So it was really trying to get at making
the platform's accountable outside the

1330
01:18:50,541 --> 01:18:52,550
platform through email. Huh. Too.

1331
01:18:52,900 --> 01:18:56,240
Which is interesting because I would never
read an email that Twitter sends you.

1332
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:00,700
This has just gotta be nonsense.
I didn't get one. So I maybe,

1333
01:19:02,360 --> 01:19:06,980
I guess I just got lucky,
but, um, I might've had a
multiple day back and forth.

1334
01:19:06,981 --> 01:19:11,720
It's a rush. But that was I think one
of the first steps towards saying like,

1335
01:19:11,780 --> 01:19:13,490
how do we make the platforms accountable?

1336
01:19:14,480 --> 01:19:18,800
Because the idea that platform
should be accountable was not a,

1337
01:19:19,130 --> 01:19:22,370
a thing that everybody agreed on in 2015
when we were having this conversation

1338
01:19:22,371 --> 01:19:26,810
about isis. And that's where there's
the, the through line here, which is, um,

1339
01:19:26,840 --> 01:19:29,090
and it does connect into some
of the speech issues too,

1340
01:19:29,780 --> 01:19:34,760
which is what kind of
monitoring and moderation do
you want the platforms to do.

1341
01:19:35,450 --> 01:19:40,190
And when we were having this
conversation about Isis, there was a, um,

1342
01:19:41,180 --> 01:19:46,180
not insignificant collection of voices
that were really concerned that if we

1343
01:19:47,391 --> 01:19:51,590
moderated isis trolls on Twitter,
they're not the beheading videos.

1344
01:19:51,591 --> 01:19:53,960
There were sort of universal agreement
that the beheading videos should come

1345
01:19:53,961 --> 01:19:58,400
down. But if we took out what were called
the Isis fanboys, which were like 30,

1346
01:19:58,401 --> 01:20:02,930
40,000 accounts at their
peak, um, that we would, yeah,

1347
01:20:02,931 --> 01:20:05,720
there's a document called the isis
Twitter census for anyone who wants to

1348
01:20:05,721 --> 01:20:10,320
actually see the research done on
understanding the Twitter network in 2015

1349
01:20:10,770 --> 01:20:14,160
there is a sense that like
one man's terrorist is
another man's freedom fighter.

1350
01:20:14,280 --> 01:20:17,520
And if we took down Isis fanboys,
um,

1351
01:20:17,580 --> 01:20:19,290
where we stifling their freedom of speech,

1352
01:20:19,291 --> 01:20:21,900
freedom of expression and like goodness,
what would come next.

1353
01:20:22,830 --> 01:20:26,360
And that when you, when
you look at that, um,

1354
01:20:26,460 --> 01:20:31,290
that fundamental swing that
has happened now in 2018,

1355
01:20:31,291 --> 01:20:33,530
2019 where those are,

1356
01:20:33,531 --> 01:20:38,040
is that same narrative because originally
no moderation was taking place and

1357
01:20:38,041 --> 01:20:40,590
then now there's a feeling that it's
kind of swung too far in the other

1358
01:20:40,591 --> 01:20:44,340
direction. Um, but the original
conversations were really,

1359
01:20:45,690 --> 01:20:49,470
how do we make Twitter take
responsibility for this?

1360
01:20:50,040 --> 01:20:54,240
And legally they aren't
responsible for it, right?

1361
01:20:54,270 --> 01:20:57,210
They are legally indemnified against the,

1362
01:20:57,960 --> 01:21:00,120
they're not responsible for any
of the content on their platforms.

1363
01:21:00,121 --> 01:21:01,140
None of the platforms are.

1364
01:21:01,490 --> 01:21:05,370
There is a law called communications
decency act section two 30,

1365
01:21:05,820 --> 01:21:07,890
and that says that
they're not responsible.

1366
01:21:07,891 --> 01:21:12,010
They have the right to moderate but not
the obligation to moderate because they

1367
01:21:12,011 --> 01:21:13,920
are indemnified from responsibility.

1368
01:21:14,370 --> 01:21:18,570
So the question becomes now that we know
that these platforms are used for these

1369
01:21:18,571 --> 01:21:21,940
kinds of harms and they are used
for this kind of interference, um,

1370
01:21:22,140 --> 01:21:23,370
where is that balance?

1371
01:21:23,371 --> 01:21:28,371
What do we want them are responsible
for monitoring and moderating and how do

1372
01:21:29,431 --> 01:21:30,780
we,
um,

1373
01:21:30,810 --> 01:21:35,670
how do we recognize that that is
occasionally going to lead to an incorrect

1374
01:21:35,671 --> 01:21:38,820
attribution's people losing
accounts and things like that. So

1375
01:21:41,540 --> 01:21:45,890
yeah, they're, they're in a
weird conundrum right now or
they don't, they, they're,

1376
01:21:45,910 --> 01:21:49,310
they're trying to keep everything safe
and they wanna encourage people to

1377
01:21:49,311 --> 01:21:53,930
communicate on the platform. So they
want to keep people from harassing folks.

1378
01:21:54,380 --> 01:21:59,380
But because of that, they've also,
they've got these algorithms and they,

1379
01:21:59,381 --> 01:21:59,870
they,

1380
01:21:59,870 --> 01:22:04,870
they tend to miss very often like this
whole learn decode fiasco where people

1381
01:22:05,451 --> 01:22:08,120
are getting banned for life
for saying learn to code,

1382
01:22:08,420 --> 01:22:10,790
which is about as preposterous as a guest.

1383
01:22:10,791 --> 01:22:14,480
I think the learn to code fiasco is going
to be the tipping point where a lot of

1384
01:22:14,481 --> 01:22:17,540
people in the,
in the future when they look back on,

1385
01:22:17,750 --> 01:22:20,900
when did the heavy
handedness become overreach,

1386
01:22:21,230 --> 01:22:23,630
learn to code because I mean,
Jesus Christ,

1387
01:22:23,631 --> 01:22:27,380
I mean that if you can't say learn to
code. I mean I look in my mentions,

1388
01:22:27,381 --> 01:22:31,100
I mean on any given day, especially
like yesterday I had um, uh,

1389
01:22:31,210 --> 01:22:35,790
a vaccine proponent. Yeah,
yeah. Peter's Great. And, and,

1390
01:22:35,791 --> 01:22:39,500
and you know, and it seemed like what
was really disturbing to me was like,

1391
01:22:39,530 --> 01:22:44,530
the vast majority of the comments were
about vaccines and so few about these

1392
01:22:45,740 --> 01:22:48,650
unchecked diseases that are running
rampant in poor communities,

1393
01:22:48,651 --> 01:22:51,230
which was the most disturbing
aspect of the conversation to me.

1394
01:22:51,470 --> 01:22:56,390
That there's diseases that rob you of
your intellectual capacity that are

1395
01:22:56,391 --> 01:22:57,410
extremely common,

1396
01:22:57,411 --> 01:23:01,190
that as many as 10% of people in these
poor neighborhoods have almost no

1397
01:23:01,191 --> 01:23:06,040
discussion. It was all just insults
and, and you know, you fucking chill and

1398
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:10,300
this and that. You know, it's
going to be interesting, but no,

1399
01:23:10,301 --> 01:23:14,950
they're going to be a disaster. I
know, I know. Well, let me, let me,

1400
01:23:17,020 --> 01:23:20,230
I think that one of the
challenges for the platforms,

1401
01:23:21,030 --> 01:23:23,050
there's a lot of things start
out like learned to code.

1402
01:23:23,051 --> 01:23:27,580
I remember I watched that play out. Um,
Covington Catholic was another thing that,

1403
01:23:27,820 --> 01:23:30,970
I mean, God, um, I learned to code.

1404
01:23:30,971 --> 01:23:34,810
There was some of the people who are
trolling and just saying learn to code and

1405
01:23:34,840 --> 01:23:37,330
you know, whatever, you don't
have a right to not be offended.

1406
01:23:37,510 --> 01:23:38,920
But then there was the,
um,

1407
01:23:39,550 --> 01:23:43,060
the other accounts that kind of took it
that step further and began to throw in

1408
01:23:43,061 --> 01:23:45,820
like the ovens and the other stuff like
that. It would learn to code. Right.

1409
01:23:46,960 --> 01:23:48,520
And that's one of the
challenges with the platform,

1410
01:23:48,521 --> 01:23:53,521
which is if you're trying to assess the,

1411
01:23:55,170 --> 01:23:59,800
um, just the content itself, like
if you start doing keyword bands,

1412
01:24:00,630 --> 01:24:02,740
you're going to catch a lot of
shit that you don't want to catch.

1413
01:24:03,220 --> 01:24:07,330
But the flip side is if
you, you know, the, the,

1414
01:24:07,360 --> 01:24:12,060
this is the challenge of
moderating at scale, which
is, um, where, you know, what,

1415
01:24:12,061 --> 01:24:13,840
what side do you come down on,

1416
01:24:13,841 --> 01:24:18,370
do come down on saying like 75% of people
with Hashtag learn to code or just,

1417
01:24:18,400 --> 01:24:23,290
you know, I'm not doing
anything incredibly offensive.

1418
01:24:23,291 --> 01:24:24,940
And then the 25% who are,

1419
01:24:25,150 --> 01:24:29,410
they really changed the tone of the
overall campaign and the Hashtag for the

1420
01:24:29,411 --> 01:24:30,520
entire community.

1421
01:24:30,521 --> 01:24:34,900
And that's where you see Twitter I think
come in with the more heavy handed and

1422
01:24:34,901 --> 01:24:38,080
just shut it down kind
of thing. Um, I don't,

1423
01:24:38,350 --> 01:24:42,850
I don't know that there's an easy
answer. I think that we are, you know,

1424
01:24:42,851 --> 01:24:45,760
even today, what was the latest
kerfuffle? Elizabeth Warren got a,

1425
01:24:45,761 --> 01:24:48,640
an ad taken down on Facebook and then
there was a whole conversation about,

1426
01:24:48,641 --> 01:24:51,460
was Facebook censoring Elizabeth Warren.
I,

1427
01:24:51,640 --> 01:24:55,960
I personally didn't think that it
read like censorship, but it was, um,

1428
01:24:56,170 --> 01:24:59,680
it was an ad about, funny enough
her a platform to break up Facebook

1429
01:25:02,700 --> 01:25:07,570
is kind of, it seemed like it sort
of read more like a cell phone.

1430
01:25:07,570 --> 01:25:10,780
Like she had a picture of
Facebook's logo in the, um,

1431
01:25:11,290 --> 01:25:15,040
in the image and there that
violates the ads terms of service.

1432
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:19,870
And the reason behind that is actually
because Facebook doesn't want people

1433
01:25:19,871 --> 01:25:22,690
putting up ads that have the Facebook
logo in it because that's how you scam

1434
01:25:22,691 --> 01:25:25,640
people or if it's a great way to,
to rip people often.

1435
01:25:25,660 --> 01:25:28,760
So probably just like an
automated, um, you know,

1436
01:25:28,780 --> 01:25:30,250
an automated take down like an automated,

1437
01:25:30,330 --> 01:25:32,980
they get halts the ad you have to go
and make some changes and then you can

1438
01:25:32,981 --> 01:25:36,490
proceed it back out again. Uh, but it
just happens at a time when there's like,

1439
01:25:36,491 --> 01:25:40,540
so little assumption of good faith
and so little assumption of, um,

1440
01:25:41,230 --> 01:25:46,080
such extreme, uh, anger
and polarization and, um,

1441
01:25:46,150 --> 01:25:50,230
you know, assumption that, um,
the platforms are censoring with,

1442
01:25:50,260 --> 01:25:54,790
with every little kind of moderation
snafu that it, it makes it,

1443
01:25:54,880 --> 01:25:55,713
I think,

1444
01:25:56,680 --> 01:26:00,590
I don't know how we have the conversation
in a way that's healthy and look

1445
01:26:00,591 --> 01:26:04,910
towards solutions as opposed to the left
screaming that it sends her the right

1446
01:26:04,911 --> 01:26:08,990
screaming that it's censored.
The platforms, um, you know,

1447
01:26:08,991 --> 01:26:11,750
trying to get around,
how do we both moderate and not moderate,

1448
01:26:11,751 --> 01:26:15,740
which is a tough position
to be in. Um, I think,

1449
01:26:17,310 --> 01:26:18,170
I don't have any

1450
01:26:18,170 --> 01:26:19,400
good,
no one does.

1451
01:26:19,401 --> 01:26:24,170
No could answer the issue
in Vigia discussed that
pretty much in depth what she

1452
01:26:24,171 --> 01:26:24,681
was saying.

1453
01:26:24,681 --> 01:26:29,681
This is about moderating and scale
when you're talking about millions and

1454
01:26:29,721 --> 01:26:34,070
millions and millions of posts and a
couple thousand people working for the

1455
01:26:34,071 --> 01:26:38,210
organization. And then
algorithms and computer learning
that's trying to keep up.

1456
01:26:38,211 --> 01:26:42,200
And that's where things like learned
to code and people are so outraged and

1457
01:26:42,201 --> 01:26:45,950
pissed off because when they
do get banned, they feel
like they've been targeted.

1458
01:26:45,980 --> 01:26:50,720
Whether you really just ran into some
code and then it's really hard to get

1459
01:26:50,721 --> 01:26:52,940
someone to pay attention to your appeal.
Right.

1460
01:26:52,970 --> 01:26:56,900
Because there's not enough people that
are looking at these appeals and there's

1461
01:26:57,080 --> 01:27:01,070
probably millions of appeals every day.
It's almost impossible.

1462
01:27:01,660 --> 01:27:05,080
Yeah. And there's, you know,
you'd depending on which,
um, which side you're on,

1463
01:27:05,081 --> 01:27:06,930
you're also here like,
um,

1464
01:27:07,240 --> 01:27:10,150
this person is harassing me and I'm
demanding moderation and nobody's doing

1465
01:27:10,151 --> 01:27:14,230
anything about it. Uh, so
it's, it's definitely I think,

1466
01:27:14,950 --> 01:27:19,330
gotten worse. Um, it's,

1467
01:27:19,570 --> 01:27:23,800
it's interesting to look back at
2016 and wonder how much of the,

1468
01:27:24,530 --> 01:27:25,363
um,

1469
01:27:26,130 --> 01:27:30,760
where we are now is in part because not
a whole lot happened in 2016 in 2016 it

1470
01:27:30,761 --> 01:27:34,300
was 2015 in particular, very
light, like almost no moderation,

1471
01:27:34,301 --> 01:27:38,150
just kind of let it all hang
out there and I look at it, um,

1472
01:27:39,310 --> 01:27:39,851
I look at it now,

1473
01:27:39,851 --> 01:27:42,640
particularly as it evolved into
this conversation about free speech,

1474
01:27:42,641 --> 01:27:44,940
public squares,
um,

1475
01:27:45,880 --> 01:27:50,880
and what the new kind of infrastructure
for speech and what rights we should

1476
01:27:51,911 --> 01:27:56,890
expect on it.
It's a really tough,

1477
01:27:57,310 --> 01:28:02,080
um, you know, I think some of it is,

1478
01:28:02,140 --> 01:28:04,150
is almost like the people who are,

1479
01:28:04,900 --> 01:28:08,590
who hear the words free speech and they
just assume that it's people asking for

1480
01:28:08,591 --> 01:28:12,400
carp launch, right. To harass
and saying, you know, um,

1481
01:28:12,430 --> 01:28:13,630
how do we balance that?

1482
01:28:13,800 --> 01:28:16,760
You have to think Jack and vagina
were saying this on your show. 'Em,

1483
01:28:17,410 --> 01:28:20,530
how do we maximize the number of people
who are involved in making sure that all

1484
01:28:20,531 --> 01:28:25,531
voices do get heard without
being unnecessarily heavy
handed and moderating a

1485
01:28:26,861 --> 01:28:31,861
thought or content and instead
moderate behavior and um,

1486
01:28:32,530 --> 01:28:34,040
and said moderate,
um,

1487
01:28:34,660 --> 01:28:39,130
particular types of signatures of things
that are inauthentic or things that are

1488
01:28:39,131 --> 01:28:43,660
coordinated and looking at this again
gets to disinflation too rather than

1489
01:28:43,661 --> 01:28:46,750
trying to police disinformation
by looking at content,

1490
01:28:47,380 --> 01:28:51,250
really looking instead at actions and
behavior and account authenticity and

1491
01:28:51,251 --> 01:28:54,490
dissemination patterns cause a lot of
the worst trolls and stuff or just using

1492
01:28:54,491 --> 01:28:58,330
these throw away accounts
and then they disappear. Well

1493
01:28:58,990 --> 01:29:03,990
you have the impression myself that when
we're talking about censorship we're

1494
01:29:04,651 --> 01:29:09,060
talking about moderating content that
really we're talking about this current

1495
01:29:09,061 --> 01:29:12,150
era and that what's
coming is essentially a,

1496
01:29:12,151 --> 01:29:17,151
we're like putting up a small like twig
fence and a herd of stampeding buffaloes

1497
01:29:19,921 --> 01:29:22,320
on the way in terms of the,

1498
01:29:22,650 --> 01:29:26,790
the more invasive or the more,

1499
01:29:27,810 --> 01:29:32,160
the more potent levels of
technology that are on the way.

1500
01:29:32,460 --> 01:29:35,340
I just feel like I feel like we're,

1501
01:29:35,400 --> 01:29:38,910
everything is moving into very specific
direction and that very specific

1502
01:29:38,911 --> 01:29:43,620
direction is less boundaries between
people and information and that includes

1503
01:29:43,621 --> 01:29:46,590
communication and it's going
to be insanely impossible,

1504
01:29:47,670 --> 01:29:52,380
insanely difficult or nearly
impossible to to moderate in 10 years.

1505
01:29:52,620 --> 01:29:54,630
I just don't think,
I don't think that's going to be,

1506
01:29:55,020 --> 01:29:58,290
I don't think it's going to be in the
wheelhouse. I just, I think it's going to,

1507
01:29:58,320 --> 01:29:58,561
we're,

1508
01:29:58,561 --> 01:30:02,490
we're entering into some weird place
where we either going to have to stay off

1509
01:30:02,491 --> 01:30:07,491
of social media because it's just too
toxic or grow a thick skin and just be

1510
01:30:07,591 --> 01:30:10,560
able to deal with anything.
And then if that's the case,

1511
01:30:10,740 --> 01:30:13,110
how are we going to be able to
differentiate between things that are

1512
01:30:13,111 --> 01:30:15,070
particularly designed to,

1513
01:30:15,420 --> 01:30:18,870
to manipulate a specifically designed
to manipulate us and change our opinions

1514
01:30:19,200 --> 01:30:23,760
by foreign entities like this.
You know, this Russian troll farm.

1515
01:30:24,610 --> 01:30:27,940
I do think the, the, you
know, when I think about like,

1516
01:30:29,650 --> 01:30:34,650
so if we believe that the misinformation
is impart facilitated by gainable

1517
01:30:34,781 --> 01:30:37,690
algorithms,
consolidation and then the targeting,

1518
01:30:37,691 --> 01:30:40,090
the kind of things we've talked
about through this conversation,

1519
01:30:41,080 --> 01:30:45,040
then I think that the algorithms piece,

1520
01:30:45,041 --> 01:30:46,300
the manipulatable algorithms,

1521
01:30:46,301 --> 01:30:49,000
that's really squarely the
responsibility of the platforms.

1522
01:30:49,360 --> 01:30:52,930
I don't think that there's any
regulation or, um, you know,

1523
01:30:52,931 --> 01:30:56,970
any kind of framework that's going to
come from Congress that's going to address

1524
01:30:56,980 --> 01:30:59,830
that. Well, that was pretty clear from
the Facebook hearings, right? I mean,

1525
01:30:59,831 --> 01:31:03,550
they barely understand that don't
know an android phone, an iPhone.

1526
01:31:04,150 --> 01:31:07,020
They really don't know what's
going on. Tim Apple. Yeah. Yeah.

1527
01:31:07,970 --> 01:31:09,540
That's the king of the world.
Right?

1528
01:31:12,080 --> 01:31:14,620
So as he did that on purpose,
which is even more hilarious,

1529
01:31:15,310 --> 01:31:19,930
just say you fucked up, man. I mean
to say that you've nuked Tim Cook,

1530
01:31:20,440 --> 01:31:25,060
his real name wasn't Tim Apple two.
It is funny. Call them to apple.

1531
01:31:25,061 --> 01:31:26,710
Although I did.
I appreciate it.

1532
01:31:26,711 --> 01:31:29,390
The rest of like every CEO in silicon
valley changing their Twitter handle

1533
01:31:29,470 --> 01:31:32,940
afterwards. Yeah. That was fun.
But I think the, uh, which,

1534
01:31:32,950 --> 01:31:35,170
and I just lost my train of
thought on that too. Sorry.

1535
01:31:36,150 --> 01:31:39,550
We're talking about you were, you
were talking about them. Oh yeah.

1536
01:31:39,551 --> 01:31:41,740
Regulate any algorithm.
Yeah.

1537
01:31:42,040 --> 01:31:47,040
So I think that ultimately the algorithmic
piece does remain squarely in the

1538
01:31:48,011 --> 01:31:51,250
purview of the platforms. And that's
because it's an arms race, right?

1539
01:31:51,251 --> 01:31:54,760
As they change their algorithm a little
bit, tweak it for the product function,

1540
01:31:55,480 --> 01:31:58,240
which they just do in
their roles business. Um,

1541
01:31:58,600 --> 01:32:01,540
there is no that's going to come
down fast enough to catch that.

1542
01:32:01,900 --> 01:32:05,560
I think actually finance is an interesting
parallel here cause like in the

1543
01:32:05,561 --> 01:32:10,270
financial markets there kinase multi
tiered levels of regulation and oversight

1544
01:32:10,271 --> 01:32:12,580
so that there's always
some entity responsible,

1545
01:32:12,581 --> 01:32:16,620
whether it's the exchange or a self
regulatory organization or the government.

1546
01:32:16,621 --> 01:32:21,621
And the SEC looking to see
if like information integrity
in the markets is being

1547
01:32:23,141 --> 01:32:27,850
maintained. Right. There's no shitty
algorithm coming in to manipulate people.

1548
01:32:28,180 --> 01:32:30,580
It's just making sure that
we have that level of trust.

1549
01:32:30,940 --> 01:32:34,420
So I think that right now the tech
ecosystem is lacking regulation and all of

1550
01:32:34,421 --> 01:32:37,000
its forms.
So that will likely change.

1551
01:32:37,540 --> 01:32:40,870
But the argument for decentralization is,

1552
01:32:40,930 --> 01:32:42,700
I don't know how you execute it.

1553
01:32:42,730 --> 01:32:47,650
I the antitrust thing in particular as
it as it comes up so much more now, um,

1554
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:48,251
just me,

1555
01:32:48,251 --> 01:32:53,251
I don't know under what economic grounds
you make that claim that's way outside

1556
01:32:53,531 --> 01:32:55,630
of my wheelhouse and my area.

1557
01:32:56,140 --> 01:32:59,260
But there is something to
be said for this, you know,

1558
01:32:59,261 --> 01:33:02,670
return to decentralization in some way.
Yeah,

1559
01:33:02,680 --> 01:33:07,620
I like it lets people have what
they want. Um, and it lets you,

1560
01:33:07,621 --> 01:33:09,760
you know, read, it's a great
example. You have these, um,

1561
01:33:10,410 --> 01:33:12,850
it's almost like federalism.
You have this central platform,

1562
01:33:12,851 --> 01:33:16,990
but then you have these little communities
under it and each community has its

1563
01:33:16,991 --> 01:33:19,660
own norms.
Each community has its own rules.

1564
01:33:20,380 --> 01:33:25,120
Nobody who violates the moderator rules
in a reddit and scream censorship has

1565
01:33:25,121 --> 01:33:27,180
really taken seriously, right. The,

1566
01:33:27,260 --> 01:33:29,530
this is the rules of the community
or in the community. There you go.

1567
01:33:29,860 --> 01:33:33,280
And this was how in the olden days of
the Internet, like use nets and things,

1568
01:33:33,281 --> 01:33:36,010
you would have this as the community
that you've chosen to be a part of.

1569
01:33:36,400 --> 01:33:39,700
If you don't like the
moderation standards, you'd
go to this other community.

1570
01:33:39,880 --> 01:33:40,121
Right.

1571
01:33:40,121 --> 01:33:45,000
I think the concern with consolidation
is that people who do get moderated away

1572
01:33:45,010 --> 01:33:47,800
feel like there's nowhere for them to go,
um,

1573
01:33:48,190 --> 01:33:52,330
that they've lost access
to the entire world. Um,

1574
01:33:54,040 --> 01:33:57,910
so I think if you have that
decentralization that it in some ways,

1575
01:33:58,990 --> 01:34:01,240
um, it, it,

1576
01:34:01,360 --> 01:34:04,690
it stops being quite so much
of a freedom of speech issue.

1577
01:34:04,691 --> 01:34:08,350
If you can't speak on,
you know, if, if you,

1578
01:34:08,680 --> 01:34:12,880
if everything is like if there's 50
different platforms and you fall foul of

1579
01:34:12,881 --> 01:34:16,510
some sort of norms or standards or
community membership in this one,

1580
01:34:16,511 --> 01:34:18,580
you can go over here to this other one.
Right.

1581
01:34:18,581 --> 01:34:21,700
And then the idea that somebody has
moderated you away or a d platform,

1582
01:34:21,701 --> 01:34:25,360
do you or something is
much less, um, potent.

1583
01:34:25,361 --> 01:34:26,980
Maybe if there are alternatives

1584
01:34:27,170 --> 01:34:30,070
though, if you dock someone or
something along those lines. Yeah,

1585
01:34:30,090 --> 01:34:32,250
there's still like federalism thing.
It's like

1586
01:34:33,930 --> 01:34:38,070
moderation at the lower levels
versus, um, it's kind of top level.

1587
01:34:38,071 --> 01:34:40,070
Like you're summarily booted off.

1588
01:34:40,190 --> 01:34:42,740
Yeah. That seems like the
best approach. Right? Like,

1589
01:34:42,741 --> 01:34:46,400
it seems like the best approach is to
sort of let these communities sort of

1590
01:34:46,401 --> 01:34:48,830
establish themselves.
But even inside those communities,

1591
01:34:48,831 --> 01:34:53,660
then you have people that gained power
through moderation and they sorta abusing

1592
01:34:53,690 --> 01:34:57,890
it and then it becomes some sort
of a weird hierarchy. It's like

1593
01:34:59,590 --> 01:35:02,270
the decentralization in general.

1594
01:35:02,960 --> 01:35:05,210
It's probably the right
move for all this stuff.

1595
01:35:05,630 --> 01:35:09,980
But how does that happen with something
like Facebook or Twitter without

1596
01:35:09,981 --> 01:35:12,860
government intervention?
And I, you know, this,

1597
01:35:12,861 --> 01:35:17,450
one of the things that Tim
Paul was bringing up, like
if you guys don't do this,

1598
01:35:17,451 --> 01:35:18,320
if you don't handle this,

1599
01:35:18,350 --> 01:35:21,620
it's entirely possible somewhere down
the line you're going to be regulated by

1600
01:35:21,621 --> 01:35:23,090
the government.
Do you really want that?

1601
01:35:23,740 --> 01:35:26,480
But that's an inevitability whether they
think so. Yeah. At this point, yeah,

1602
01:35:27,410 --> 01:35:28,243
it's going to happen.

1603
01:35:30,390 --> 01:35:31,051
Well,
you know,

1604
01:35:31,051 --> 01:35:36,051
honestly I say that and I think back to
the reality which is in this congress

1605
01:35:36,061 --> 01:35:39,810
with this executive, I don't know how
we get any regulation through. Um,

1606
01:35:43,400 --> 01:35:44,233
I,

1607
01:35:44,520 --> 01:35:48,450
I think we've seen some examples
like the honest ads act,

1608
01:35:49,740 --> 01:35:54,570
which was introduced right
before the first tech hearing,

1609
01:35:54,571 --> 01:35:56,010
if I'm remembering the timeline correctly.

1610
01:35:56,011 --> 01:35:59,100
So that would have been like late 2017.

1611
01:36:00,150 --> 01:36:02,830
And what they said was,
um,

1612
01:36:04,280 --> 01:36:07,260
it's when you can no longer have like
a free for all with ads on social

1613
01:36:07,261 --> 01:36:09,900
platforms where nobody knows who paid
for it or where it's coming from or

1614
01:36:09,901 --> 01:36:14,790
anything like that. And um,
and what they, you know,

1615
01:36:14,791 --> 01:36:15,081
that,

1616
01:36:15,081 --> 01:36:18,680
so senator Klobuchar and Senator Warner
and I think Senator Mccain also was, uh,

1617
01:36:18,730 --> 01:36:20,360
was part of this,
um,

1618
01:36:21,270 --> 01:36:24,390
create this law saying that the platforms
have to follow the rules that TV and

1619
01:36:24,391 --> 01:36:25,410
radio already follow.

1620
01:36:26,250 --> 01:36:30,920
And this is an example of
recognizing the role that, that,

1621
01:36:31,020 --> 01:36:34,430
you know, these are no longer
startups. They can't be, you know,

1622
01:36:34,431 --> 01:36:36,330
that that can't meet these obligations.

1623
01:36:36,810 --> 01:36:41,380
It used to be that Facebook was
exempt from these, um, from these, uh,

1624
01:36:41,400 --> 01:36:43,410
disclosure requirements because
they're ads used should be those,

1625
01:36:43,500 --> 01:36:46,170
remember those tiny postage stamp sized
things that were on the right side of

1626
01:36:46,171 --> 01:36:51,090
the page. So they had a finding.
It was, they were, they were,

1627
01:36:51,091 --> 01:36:51,924
um,

1628
01:36:52,260 --> 01:36:57,090
given the same exemption that campaign's
kept for like skywriting and postage

1629
01:36:57,150 --> 01:36:58,490
and pencils,
you know,

1630
01:36:58,500 --> 01:37:03,150
where it's like literally the form factor
of the content makes it such that you

1631
01:37:03,151 --> 01:37:04,800
can't put the ad disclaimer on there.

1632
01:37:05,250 --> 01:37:09,390
And it used to be that
all of the advertising on
Facebook was regulated using

1633
01:37:09,391 --> 01:37:10,740
that same finding that,
that,

1634
01:37:10,860 --> 01:37:13,870
that these postage stamp size
things are too small to put the,

1635
01:37:14,710 --> 01:37:16,380
the disclosures on.
And then of course,

1636
01:37:16,381 --> 01:37:19,740
as we know that evolved into the ads
being looking much like an organic post.

1637
01:37:19,741 --> 01:37:23,310
And so now they do have these
little little things that
pop up where you can see

1638
01:37:23,311 --> 01:37:25,380
why you got targeted and what it is.

1639
01:37:25,381 --> 01:37:29,850
I think that that's an example of like
the credible threat of regulation and the

1640
01:37:29,910 --> 01:37:34,440
public opinion moving the platform to
take an action that it wouldn't have

1641
01:37:34,441 --> 01:37:39,120
necessarily done on its own. So
it's not regulation, but it's, um,

1642
01:37:40,320 --> 01:37:44,160
it's a nudge through public opinion and,
um,

1643
01:37:44,970 --> 01:37:46,740
the credible threat of future regulation.

1644
01:37:46,920 --> 01:37:50,580
We've seen California go after
the platforms. Also recently,

1645
01:37:50,581 --> 01:37:54,300
there was a California GDPR
thing from last year, um,

1646
01:37:54,720 --> 01:37:58,830
California legislature saying we're
going to pass a privacy requirement. Um,

1647
01:37:59,670 --> 01:38:04,170
and uh, and they did it. They got it
done. What is the privacy requirement?

1648
01:38:05,100 --> 01:38:05,940
Oh boy.
Um,

1649
01:38:07,520 --> 01:38:11,880
I feel like I'm probably not the best
person to explain this because I don't

1650
01:38:11,881 --> 01:38:16,730
know the specifics, but the GDPR was
the law in the UK and in Europe. Um,

1651
01:38:16,770 --> 01:38:21,090
that protects the data. It creates
particular protections like you're,

1652
01:38:21,720 --> 01:38:22,553
um,

1653
01:38:22,710 --> 01:38:25,620
you have to re opt in for targeting there
certain kinds of targeting that they

1654
01:38:25,621 --> 01:38:28,320
can't do, certain types of data
that you can request they delete.

1655
01:38:28,740 --> 01:38:33,450
So this is a provision that took effect
in Europe last year and we don't have

1656
01:38:33,451 --> 01:38:36,390
that same law here in the u s where we
don't have the same data protections as

1657
01:38:36,391 --> 01:38:37,224
the Europeans.

1658
01:38:37,530 --> 01:38:42,030
And so California Gdpr was the
California state government,

1659
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:46,320
the state Senate legislature passing a
law that basically mimicked a lot of the

1660
01:38:46,321 --> 01:38:49,650
provisions of what the
Europeans were given under Gdpr.

1661
01:38:50,460 --> 01:38:55,350
But what that did was it created a law
that applied to the people of California.

1662
01:38:55,710 --> 01:38:59,040
And so Facebook and Twitter and the
others don't want to be in a position of

1663
01:38:59,041 --> 01:39:03,620
having to have this, um, you know,
kind of balkanization or a bomb,

1664
01:39:04,030 --> 01:39:07,740
a legal requirements.
And so they in turn have now I believe,

1665
01:39:07,800 --> 01:39:10,290
gone to Congress suggesting that a,

1666
01:39:10,291 --> 01:39:13,560
that we're going to need to have a federal
solution that applies to all of the u

1667
01:39:13,560 --> 01:39:17,110
s so a federal level privacy regulation,
um,

1668
01:39:17,190 --> 01:39:20,630
because they don't want to have to
adhere to the privacy regulations of like

1669
01:39:20,670 --> 01:39:22,020
each individual us state.

1670
01:39:22,770 --> 01:39:27,770
One solution that's been tossed up was
that people would have to somehow or

1671
01:39:29,611 --> 01:39:30,930
another confirm their identity.

1672
01:39:31,110 --> 01:39:34,860
Then instead of it being an anonymous
posts that it would have to say,

1673
01:39:34,861 --> 01:39:38,820
Rene de Resta, like, I know who you
are. You have to have a photograph,

1674
01:39:39,060 --> 01:39:41,640
have some sort of a government
id shows that it's you,

1675
01:39:42,120 --> 01:39:46,110
that we would somehow or
another minimize trolling,

1676
01:39:46,530 --> 01:39:49,350
minimize this information if you,

1677
01:39:49,380 --> 01:39:52,950
if your account was connected to a social
security number or whatever it was.

1678
01:39:53,130 --> 01:39:56,640
The problem, of course is that these
damn things get hacked all the time.

1679
01:39:56,970 --> 01:39:59,160
And if your Twitter account gets hacked,

1680
01:39:59,190 --> 01:40:02,220
now they have your social security number,
they have your address,

1681
01:40:02,221 --> 01:40:05,490
they have your information that
you use to sign up. And you know,

1682
01:40:05,491 --> 01:40:09,900
there's a lot of it unless there's
some way and there isn't too,

1683
01:40:09,901 --> 01:40:14,430
absolutely lock down all that data and
make sure that it's an accessible to some

1684
01:40:14,431 --> 01:40:18,990
sort of third party that doesn't seem
like a likely course of action either.

1685
01:40:19,540 --> 01:40:23,700
And I think, um, the question of identity,

1686
01:40:23,701 --> 01:40:26,860
I think most social science research,
um,

1687
01:40:27,450 --> 01:40:32,400
that I've read has suggested that that's
not necessarily the be all and end all.

1688
01:40:33,080 --> 01:40:37,020
I think it depends on, um, [inaudible]
per your point what you're trying to do.

1689
01:40:37,380 --> 01:40:38,820
I'm thinking right now of the,
um,

1690
01:40:38,880 --> 01:40:43,880
there was this request for FTC comments
for net neutrality and I know that,

1691
01:40:45,300 --> 01:40:49,620
um, a lot of them were, you know,
whoever left them there, lot tons,

1692
01:40:49,621 --> 01:40:50,830
I think millions actually of,

1693
01:40:50,850 --> 01:40:53,690
of these fake comments that were
left on the net neutrality, um,

1694
01:40:54,580 --> 01:40:58,780
call for public comment
where they were scraping, um,

1695
01:40:59,380 --> 01:41:00,670
like the, you know, those, um,

1696
01:41:01,060 --> 01:41:04,030
those crappy data brokers as horrible
things where like your name and your

1697
01:41:04,031 --> 01:41:06,910
address is up there and like, no matter
how hard you try, you can't get it done.

1698
01:41:07,610 --> 01:41:08,050
Um,

1699
01:41:08,050 --> 01:41:13,050
so scraping those to grab names and
addresses and then email addresses and

1700
01:41:13,481 --> 01:41:18,100
leaving. I'm leaving comments
pretending to be those people. It's,

1701
01:41:18,310 --> 01:41:19,180
it's hard.
Nobody,

1702
01:41:19,210 --> 01:41:22,840
most people don't want to enter their
social security number and to some form or

1703
01:41:22,841 --> 01:41:27,580
validation. Um, a lot of people
will point to things like, well,

1704
01:41:27,581 --> 01:41:31,840
you know, America has a strong
commitment to anonymous speech. So,

1705
01:41:32,470 --> 01:41:35,800
um, so there's that and cultural
thing. Oh, I think, you know,

1706
01:41:35,920 --> 01:41:39,490
people will point to like a federalist
papers and penis and so on and so forth.

1707
01:41:39,880 --> 01:41:44,250
Official blowers and whistleblowers.
Yeah, I think I've seen, uh,

1708
01:41:44,251 --> 01:41:48,880
I remember when Facebook did make it a
requirement to you have to validate your

1709
01:41:48,881 --> 01:41:50,230
actual name and address.

1710
01:41:50,231 --> 01:41:53,920
They send a postcard to your house
if you want to run political ads. Um,

1711
01:41:54,790 --> 01:41:59,350
and then I remember people complaining
that people who didn't have you know,

1712
01:41:59,351 --> 01:42:02,710
that this was going to,
um, what was it? Oh God,

1713
01:42:02,711 --> 01:42:07,250
this was during the Daca
arguments. So, um, that, yeah,

1714
01:42:07,300 --> 01:42:12,220
during the, it was during some of the
illegal immigration debates, right? Right.

1715
01:42:12,221 --> 01:42:13,490
As this was happening,
um,

1716
01:42:13,600 --> 01:42:17,470
people began complaining that immigration
activists who are undocumented would

1717
01:42:17,471 --> 01:42:22,060
not be able to run Facebook ads because
they didn't have a identification to

1718
01:42:22,061 --> 01:42:25,300
verify with.
So no matter what people put out,

1719
01:42:25,301 --> 01:42:28,840
there's going to be somebody
who has a complaint about it.

1720
01:42:29,770 --> 01:42:34,060
So we're in this, this
like, um, this gridlock,

1721
01:42:34,061 --> 01:42:39,061
everybody recognizes that the situation
sucks and that social media is a

1722
01:42:40,690 --> 01:42:44,080
disaster on a myriad number of,
of fronts.

1723
01:42:44,081 --> 01:42:49,081
And there's not much in the way of
a plausible solutions I think for

1724
01:42:53,081 --> 01:42:56,440
disinflation in particular,
just to stay in my wheelhouse,

1725
01:42:56,490 --> 01:43:00,250
we're trying to push towards
multistakeholder ism,

1726
01:43:00,280 --> 01:43:02,510
which is just to say can we create,
um,

1727
01:43:03,610 --> 01:43:07,420
the back channel channels of communication
that have come up for election

1728
01:43:07,421 --> 01:43:10,840
integrity and things over the last
few years, last year and a half.

1729
01:43:11,230 --> 01:43:15,370
Can we standardize that in some way?
Um, can we create an oversight body?

1730
01:43:15,400 --> 01:43:18,850
Maybe the FTC that is at
least responsible for, um,

1731
01:43:19,210 --> 01:43:23,800
having some oversight to make sure the
platforms are doing enough. But this is,

1732
01:43:23,801 --> 01:43:26,770
I think this is going to be
the, the theme of 2019. Does it,

1733
01:43:26,771 --> 01:43:29,710
does it go the antitrust route?
Does it go the privacy route?

1734
01:43:29,720 --> 01:43:33,820
Like does it do a kind of
hybrid combination of multiple,

1735
01:43:34,800 --> 01:43:36,980
um,
tackling multiple problems at once.

1736
01:43:36,981 --> 01:43:41,981
It really curious to see how we shake
this out cause it just seems like no even

1737
01:43:43,661 --> 01:43:48,230
agreeing on what the problem is or
not quite there yet. And you're,

1738
01:43:48,340 --> 01:43:52,100
you are seeing calls like
particularly from Elizabeth Warren for

1739
01:43:52,820 --> 01:43:56,390
breaking up a lot of these
larger institutions, not just,

1740
01:43:56,780 --> 01:43:59,360
not just even social media,
but even Amazon.

1741
01:43:59,361 --> 01:44:03,440
She's talking about breaking up a
lot of these bigger companies. Um,

1742
01:44:04,100 --> 01:44:09,100
it's the problem with that is like to
what and make them what and then what

1743
01:44:09,711 --> 01:44:11,170
happens. And then, you know, one of the,

1744
01:44:11,400 --> 01:44:14,810
what if one of those things that you
broke up that becomes Twitter becomes more

1745
01:44:14,811 --> 01:44:19,811
popular than the other Twitter and it
has much more attendance than what he'd

1746
01:44:19,881 --> 01:44:20,610
do.

1747
01:44:20,610 --> 01:44:24,210
Yeah. You should get one of those
people onto it to just talk about that.

1748
01:44:24,211 --> 01:44:27,990
Cause um, Lena Connor or somebody who, um,

1749
01:44:28,020 --> 01:44:31,940
really Matt Stoller knows this space
in and out and I just don't, um,

1750
01:44:32,730 --> 01:44:36,900
the eye, you know,

1751
01:44:37,230 --> 01:44:39,330
personally what I feel like the,

1752
01:44:40,170 --> 01:44:42,630
a lot of people are moving
into smaller communities.

1753
01:44:42,631 --> 01:44:46,050
A lot of people are moving into
groups are moving into whatsapp chats.

1754
01:44:46,051 --> 01:44:51,051
They're recognizing that the system as
it is right now has this toxicity and are

1755
01:44:55,110 --> 01:44:57,570
withdrawing a bit. I don't know if
you've seen this in your friends,

1756
01:44:57,571 --> 01:44:58,404
your community,
but yeah.

1757
01:44:58,720 --> 01:44:59,710
Well I have it in,

1758
01:44:59,711 --> 01:45:02,560
Jamie and I were actually talking
about it yesterday in terms of the,

1759
01:45:02,590 --> 01:45:06,610
the use of Twitter, the use
of Twitter dropped. And um,

1760
01:45:07,060 --> 01:45:12,060
one thing that I notice is that my
follower numbers doesn't move very much on

1761
01:45:12,341 --> 01:45:16,990
Twitter as opposed to like Instagram. I
don't really use Facebook, but Instagram,

1762
01:45:17,060 --> 01:45:21,160
there's a giant difference in how
many followers I get per day on either

1763
01:45:21,161 --> 01:45:25,090
platform. And it seems to me that
the people that are using Twitter,

1764
01:45:25,200 --> 01:45:27,010
they have kind of like locked in.

1765
01:45:27,100 --> 01:45:31,450
They've found their little
communities and it's mostly toxic.

1766
01:45:32,260 --> 01:45:36,500
I mean, I mean, I'm sure I'm
generalizing, I'm not, it's,

1767
01:45:36,670 --> 01:45:41,560
I am for sure. It's probably not even
10% toxic, but it seems toxic. You know,

1768
01:45:41,561 --> 01:45:44,410
when you look at those kind of
comments and anytime something happens,

1769
01:45:44,411 --> 01:45:49,411
it seems like the reaction to it is very
rarely is it some sort of a objective,

1770
01:45:50,411 --> 01:45:54,250
rational discourse.
It's most likely just insults and

1771
01:45:55,750 --> 01:45:58,980
swears. It's weird. It's just, uh, it, it,

1772
01:45:59,020 --> 01:46:04,020
people are communicating in a way online
that they communicated in real life.

1773
01:46:06,370 --> 01:46:08,440
There would be blood in the streets.

1774
01:46:08,600 --> 01:46:13,190
I think about that a lot actually.
Yeah, I do. I think that the um,

1775
01:46:13,500 --> 01:46:17,030
and what are the, you know, especially I
was listening to your, to your thing with,

1776
01:46:17,031 --> 01:46:19,130
with Tim and Andy and Jack and vagina,

1777
01:46:20,110 --> 01:46:20,943
the

1778
01:46:21,980 --> 01:46:25,640
yeah. Of the Public Square.
And I use this metaphor too,

1779
01:46:25,670 --> 01:46:28,160
like when I write about them that
the privatized public square,

1780
01:46:28,610 --> 01:46:33,320
but then I think about it sometimes I'm
like we've never had a national public

1781
01:46:33,321 --> 01:46:33,561
square.

1782
01:46:33,561 --> 01:46:38,030
There is no such thing in the history
of America as a National Public Square.

1783
01:46:38,270 --> 01:46:41,540
There are regional public squares
or a town squares, state squares,

1784
01:46:41,541 --> 01:46:45,740
you know where there is again
this kind of federalism, um,

1785
01:46:46,190 --> 01:46:49,920
people who have self selected to live
in a particular community norms in that

1786
01:46:49,921 --> 01:46:50,754
community.

1787
01:46:50,880 --> 01:46:54,420
But if I were to go up to you in a
public square and start screaming in your

1788
01:46:54,421 --> 01:46:56,400
face or you know,

1789
01:46:56,520 --> 01:46:59,730
being an asshole and trying to get a
whole mob together to go after you,

1790
01:46:59,731 --> 01:47:03,060
like probably somebody would intervene
either a bystander or the police.

1791
01:47:03,390 --> 01:47:05,880
And we have notions of like
nuisance and things like that.

1792
01:47:05,881 --> 01:47:08,480
We have notions of like there's,
there's more of a,

1793
01:47:08,481 --> 01:47:12,000
an intuitive sense of the
balance between speech,

1794
01:47:12,060 --> 01:47:16,230
which is to be protected and then the
kind of fighting words and that sort of

1795
01:47:16,231 --> 01:47:19,860
thing. There's no clear lines on that.
There's not much in the way of norms.

1796
01:47:20,190 --> 01:47:23,580
And when you're online there is nobody
who is going to come in and step in and

1797
01:47:23,581 --> 01:47:27,000
intervene in a way that would play out in,
in real life.

1798
01:47:27,750 --> 01:47:31,610
So the, I think that we, we have,

1799
01:47:31,620 --> 01:47:36,620
we just haven't quite ported those
norms of basic good behavior in the real

1800
01:47:38,191 --> 01:47:39,640
world,
um,

1801
01:47:39,840 --> 01:47:44,840
into this massive roiling crowd that's
just sort of always on at all times.

1802
01:47:45,780 --> 01:47:48,090
And that's, that's sort of more
where we are on social media.

1803
01:47:48,220 --> 01:47:48,521
Well,

1804
01:47:48,521 --> 01:47:52,060
I think there's actually a carry over
to real life from social media that you

1805
01:47:52,061 --> 01:47:57,061
can find in these protests at universities
when conservative speakers come and

1806
01:47:57,101 --> 01:47:59,350
then antifa wants to shut them down.

1807
01:47:59,351 --> 01:48:02,140
And then you have people like
the proud boys fight with Antifa.

1808
01:48:02,710 --> 01:48:06,700
I don't remember that before ever.
I think this is,

1809
01:48:06,880 --> 01:48:11,770
this is a byproduct of the
type of communication that's
the norm on social media.

1810
01:48:11,950 --> 01:48:13,360
I really think that's
what's happening here.

1811
01:48:13,361 --> 01:48:18,361
I really think that instead of
social media mimicking real life,

1812
01:48:18,400 --> 01:48:21,550
real life is starting to mimic the kinds
of interactions that people have on

1813
01:48:21,551 --> 01:48:26,050
social media and with
violent repercussions. It's
certainly if not violent,

1814
01:48:26,051 --> 01:48:31,051
very aggressive and angry in a way
that it go back before social media.

1815
01:48:31,751 --> 01:48:32,530
When was the law,

1816
01:48:32,530 --> 01:48:37,530
I mean in 2000 and in the 1990s how often
were there these incredibly volatile

1817
01:48:41,590 --> 01:48:46,590
protests at universities where you have
conservatives and liberals screaming at

1818
01:48:47,051 --> 01:48:48,230
each other and you have these,

1819
01:48:48,231 --> 01:48:50,410
these people that are being
deployed at formed and,

1820
01:48:50,580 --> 01:48:54,040
and they won't let them speak at
these colleges and then they're,

1821
01:48:54,041 --> 01:48:58,870
they're gathering up this online mob to
try to bolster support and then people

1822
01:48:58,871 --> 01:49:02,920
come to meet them. We're going to stop
them at all costs. And it's kind of,

1823
01:49:03,070 --> 01:49:08,070
it's kind of flavoring real life versus
real life being represented in social

1824
01:49:09,221 --> 01:49:13,270
media. Yeah, I don't, I don't remember
it from when I was in college either. No,

1825
01:49:13,271 --> 01:49:16,390
it didn't exist. Not, not the expert on,

1826
01:49:16,630 --> 01:49:18,430
you got to go back college
protests and the, you know,

1827
01:49:18,431 --> 01:49:21,730
maybe people would point to the
60s want to go back to Kent State.

1828
01:49:21,731 --> 01:49:23,640
That's what I was gonna say.
You gotta go back to war protest.

1829
01:49:23,641 --> 01:49:26,620
But they were protesting
something very specific,

1830
01:49:26,650 --> 01:49:31,540
an unjust war that nobody wanted to
be a part of. This is a weird time.

1831
01:49:32,010 --> 01:49:34,290
Yeah, it is. It, um,

1832
01:49:34,990 --> 01:49:39,700
I know it feels unstable.
Yes, yes. That's the best way.

1833
01:49:40,060 --> 01:49:44,750
But it's also awesome. I'm enjoying
the shit out of it. I mean it's,

1834
01:49:45,080 --> 01:49:49,150
well, because I, I love fact that it, it,

1835
01:49:49,960 --> 01:49:51,670
for the first time in my life,

1836
01:49:51,671 --> 01:49:54,640
it does not seem like the government
has a fucking handle on how people are

1837
01:49:54,641 --> 01:49:58,240
behaving and thinking at all.
Like they don't know what's going on.

1838
01:49:58,270 --> 01:50:01,600
It's like you've got people that are,
you know,

1839
01:50:02,380 --> 01:50:06,390
people that are trying out
socialists tropes and, and,

1840
01:50:06,391 --> 01:50:09,970
and socialist ideas for the first time
in the main stream and they're getting a

1841
01:50:09,971 --> 01:50:11,560
big groundswell of support behind it.

1842
01:50:11,561 --> 01:50:15,840
And then you have a lot of people that
are like pro nationalists and Pro America

1843
01:50:15,870 --> 01:50:19,270
for the first time. In a long time.
And that's getting a lot of support.

1844
01:50:19,510 --> 01:50:22,570
There's more discourse now,
even if it's toxic.

1845
01:50:22,870 --> 01:50:27,460
And I think a lot of it isn't, I
think, like I said, if 10% is toxic,

1846
01:50:27,461 --> 01:50:30,910
it seems like it's all toxic. One out
of 10 people calls you a piece of shit.

1847
01:50:30,911 --> 01:50:33,730
You're like, I've got to get out of this
fucking forum. Right. I mean, that's,

1848
01:50:33,731 --> 01:50:35,020
that's really how it feels.

1849
01:50:35,340 --> 01:50:38,630
I think that's true. There's definitely
a, um, I've noticed that too.

1850
01:50:38,631 --> 01:50:42,080
The actual numbers of,
of,

1851
01:50:42,320 --> 01:50:46,460
of a horrible trolls or maybe this
afternoon will be different. I don't know,

1852
01:50:47,200 --> 01:50:51,620
don't try to prove you
wrong. It's, I, you know,

1853
01:50:52,100 --> 01:50:56,990
I'm on Twitter a lot and, uh, it's the
platform I use more than any other. Um,

1854
01:50:57,230 --> 01:50:59,270
so for all the, you know,
for all the complaints,

1855
01:50:59,271 --> 01:51:04,271
I do feel like there's some real
value there for me personally.

1856
01:51:05,450 --> 01:51:08,930
And, um, and I, I like,

1857
01:51:11,270 --> 01:51:13,700
I like the serendipity of,

1858
01:51:14,390 --> 01:51:17,600
of the unexpected being pushed into
my feed occasionally. Sometimes it's,

1859
01:51:17,601 --> 01:51:22,010
you know, uh, sometimes of
course I get angry or, you know,

1860
01:51:22,130 --> 01:51:26,990
feel annoyed or think, why the hell
didn't you know, why, why this? Um,

1861
01:51:27,050 --> 01:51:31,220
but I think ultimately the,
there is a lot of value to the platform.

1862
01:51:31,520 --> 01:51:32,600
I think we're,
unfortunately,

1863
01:51:32,630 --> 01:51:37,630
I really do believe that so much of the
polarization and the conversation around

1864
01:51:38,181 --> 01:51:43,181
speech is people who got burned
during the laissez faire days of 2015,

1865
01:51:43,851 --> 01:51:48,851
2016 in mentally linking up the idea
of free speech with the idea of being

1866
01:51:50,991 --> 01:51:54,610
harassed online. And I
think when you look at, um,

1867
01:51:55,420 --> 01:51:57,620
this is purely an opinion, I have
absolutely no data to bear this out.

1868
01:51:57,680 --> 01:52:01,770
But when you look at those
Pew studies that show, um,

1869
01:52:02,330 --> 01:52:07,160
that younger people are
more likely to want,

1870
01:52:07,600 --> 01:52:12,440
you know, it's safe spaces or less,
you know, less offensive opinions. I,

1871
01:52:12,680 --> 01:52:15,970
I do sometimes wonder if that's a,
um,

1872
01:52:16,020 --> 01:52:18,800
an effect of coming of age
at a point when, you know,

1873
01:52:18,801 --> 01:52:22,910
random ass holes were screaming at you on
social platforms 24, seven versus like,

1874
01:52:23,150 --> 01:52:24,890
I didn't have that experience growing up.

1875
01:52:24,891 --> 01:52:28,700
I didn't have that experience until
I was like 25, you know, so, um,

1876
01:52:29,570 --> 01:52:33,290
so maybe there is something
pre your point about that. Um,

1877
01:52:33,320 --> 01:52:38,000
the almost there is not much
of a difference as you know,

1878
01:52:38,001 --> 01:52:39,440
people spend so much time online.

1879
01:52:39,441 --> 01:52:43,190
This is where you're having your social
engagements is where you're having your

1880
01:52:43,191 --> 01:52:46,940
conversation. So it does shape
the way people think about,

1881
01:52:48,130 --> 01:52:50,550
you know,
their experience of,

1882
01:52:50,551 --> 01:52:53,690
of what it means to have a conversation
and what it means to speak freely.

1883
01:52:53,691 --> 01:52:58,220
I think that's one of the interesting,
uh, you know, it doesn't help that the um,

1884
01:52:58,280 --> 01:53:03,280
but free speech has sometimes in many
cases become a Figley for I want carte

1885
01:53:03,381 --> 01:53:08,000
blanche to, you know, say all kinds
of mean shit to people all day long.

1886
01:53:08,180 --> 01:53:09,860
No consequences.
Yeah.

1887
01:53:09,861 --> 01:53:13,040
They think they should be able to do that
cause that that falls into the blanket

1888
01:53:13,041 --> 01:53:14,590
of freestyle.
Um,

1889
01:53:14,630 --> 01:53:19,630
there's also an issue I think with
young kids today that have smartphone

1890
01:53:19,791 --> 01:53:23,510
addictions. People today I should say,
I forgot young kids. How about me?

1891
01:53:23,840 --> 01:53:28,840
Humans with smartphone addiction and when
you're online and when you think about

1892
01:53:29,541 --> 01:53:32,150
the majority of your
interactions with human beings,

1893
01:53:32,640 --> 01:53:36,560
but there's a lot of folks that are
on their phone eight hours in a day.

1894
01:53:36,740 --> 01:53:39,620
That's probably me.
But think about those interactions.

1895
01:53:39,800 --> 01:53:43,970
That's a shocking number of interactions
with people that you're not even direct

1896
01:53:43,971 --> 01:53:48,920
physical, the presence of your,
you're, you're not looking
at them. You're not, you,

1897
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:50,930
you're not waiting for them to talk.

1898
01:53:50,931 --> 01:53:54,020
You're not considering what they're
saying in our reading, social cues,

1899
01:53:54,140 --> 01:53:56,930
all the things that make us human,
those are all thrown out the window.

1900
01:53:56,931 --> 01:54:00,230
You're just looking at text and
it might be coming from Russia,

1901
01:54:01,610 --> 01:54:06,610
the texts that you're getting upset at
in responding to mean per year research.

1902
01:54:06,740 --> 01:54:09,140
Really there's a direct possibility.

1903
01:54:09,141 --> 01:54:12,620
It's not even a fucking
person or a person, but not,

1904
01:54:12,680 --> 01:54:15,740
not really representing
their actual thoughts. Just
trying to push your buttons.

1905
01:54:15,830 --> 01:54:20,030
Yeah, no, that's true. It's a, it's
not even Russian trolls. It's just the,

1906
01:54:20,300 --> 01:54:25,010
um, the amount of, I think it really is,

1907
01:54:25,400 --> 01:54:27,320
we're in the unique time work.

1908
01:54:27,500 --> 01:54:30,920
It's hard to know who
you're engaging with.

1909
01:54:30,921 --> 01:54:33,430
It's hard to gauge whether it's
good faith. It's, I mean, I,

1910
01:54:33,490 --> 01:54:38,490
I react sometimes where
I'll see a response and go
click into the person's feed

1911
01:54:38,821 --> 01:54:42,710
to try to decide if I should take this
as a seriously good faith inquiry or if

1912
01:54:42,711 --> 01:54:46,480
it's like a, like a, you
know, kind of vaguely cloaked.
Fuck you, you know? Right,

1913
01:54:46,750 --> 01:54:49,730
right. You don't have to do
that when you're in person.

1914
01:54:49,731 --> 01:54:51,820
It's a very different and
very different experience.

1915
01:54:51,890 --> 01:54:54,680
Yeah. I have a friend of
mine who's a, a young,

1916
01:54:54,681 --> 01:54:59,450
single male and he was going
through his direct messages and uh,

1917
01:54:59,490 --> 01:55:03,980
these girls were sending him all these
naked photos and videos and uh, he's like,

1918
01:55:03,981 --> 01:55:06,590
look at this man. I go, let
me see your phone. And I said,

1919
01:55:06,591 --> 01:55:09,880
let me click on that link. I go, she
has one picture on her page. Right.

1920
01:55:10,220 --> 01:55:13,550
You fucking dummy. This is
probably not even a person. Like,

1921
01:55:13,580 --> 01:55:14,391
who knows what this is.

1922
01:55:14,391 --> 01:55:17,700
Someone from Nigeria is trying to get
your credit card information. Yeah.

1923
01:55:17,840 --> 01:55:21,650
Cat Fishing. Yup. Yeah. I mean, they're
trying to get you and he's like, oh yeah.

1924
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:24,860
Like, wow. How do you did not go to
her page? Cause I had just, you know,

1925
01:55:25,250 --> 01:55:28,750
I thought it was a girl send
me naked pictures. Just, yeah,

1926
01:55:28,760 --> 01:55:32,150
they just do that sometimes.
Well they definitely do do that sometimes,

1927
01:55:32,151 --> 01:55:35,470
but I mean, people are weird. They do
all kinds of weird things. But you know,

1928
01:55:35,480 --> 01:55:35,870
there's,

1929
01:55:35,870 --> 01:55:39,320
there's a lot of these fake accounts and
I don't know what they're trying to do.

1930
01:55:39,321 --> 01:55:41,030
They're trying to get money from people or

1931
01:55:41,470 --> 01:55:44,550
that does come up. I've seen
'em every now and then, uh,

1932
01:55:44,750 --> 01:55:48,360
if you follow reporters on Twitter,
particularly ones who have like open dms,

1933
01:55:48,361 --> 01:55:51,080
I'll periodically post the
insane catfishing, you know,

1934
01:55:51,090 --> 01:55:56,070
stuff that they get where it's like
all about money or I don't have,

1935
01:55:56,080 --> 01:55:59,730
I don't know. I, God bless people who have
opened dams. I don't know how they do. It

1936
01:56:01,550 --> 01:56:06,540
makes me glad I'm not a
journalist. Yeah. So overall,

1937
01:56:07,800 --> 01:56:11,400
are you happy that you got into all this?
Does this,

1938
01:56:11,401 --> 01:56:15,420
does this change your
perceptions on communication?

1939
01:56:16,650 --> 01:56:20,850
I feel like there's,
I have tried over the years,

1940
01:56:20,910 --> 01:56:25,770
whether it's conspiracy theorists,
communities are terrorists or, um,

1941
01:56:26,460 --> 01:56:29,640
or, uh, you know, Russia, Iran
state. The state sponsored actors,

1942
01:56:29,641 --> 01:56:33,960
the domestic ideologues. Um, I
have tried to always say like,

1943
01:56:34,050 --> 01:56:39,050
here's the specific kind of forensic
analysis of this particular operation and

1944
01:56:40,711 --> 01:56:44,880
then here is what we can maybe take
from it and make, make changes.

1945
01:56:45,600 --> 01:56:49,770
Um, we've, we've seen some
of that begin to take shape.

1946
01:56:49,771 --> 01:56:51,660
And so I feel grateful to

1947
01:56:53,490 --> 01:56:57,270
have had the opportunity to work towards
connecting those dots and work towards

1948
01:56:57,271 --> 01:56:58,440
having this conversation.

1949
01:56:58,980 --> 01:57:02,730
I'm meaning meaning helping
people understand what's going on.

1950
01:57:03,030 --> 01:57:05,310
I think I am not,

1951
01:57:06,600 --> 01:57:11,190
I am most concerned about the,

1952
01:57:13,080 --> 01:57:18,080
as this gets increasingly easy to
do through things like chatbots.

1953
01:57:18,600 --> 01:57:23,460
Um, you know, now there's these, um,
you've seen the, uh, the website,

1954
01:57:23,570 --> 01:57:26,730
this person does not exist.com.
So it's a,

1955
01:57:26,731 --> 01:57:29,310
there's a technology called
a machine learning technique,

1956
01:57:29,311 --> 01:57:31,500
generative adversarial
networks. And they, um,

1957
01:57:31,530 --> 01:57:36,510
it's these basically there in this
particular application working to create

1958
01:57:36,750 --> 01:57:41,640
pictures of people, faces of people. And
so this website is, when you go to it,

1959
01:57:41,641 --> 01:57:44,750
it pulls up a, yeah, there you go. So
this person does not actually exist.

1960
01:57:44,751 --> 01:57:48,130
It's not a religion. Yeah.
And so these are all, um,

1961
01:57:49,160 --> 01:57:52,980
these are computer generated. Yup. So,
and you can see created by against,

1962
01:57:53,370 --> 01:57:55,680
it says it down at the bottom there.
So these are not real people.

1963
01:57:56,100 --> 01:57:59,430
And so we have increasingly
sophisticated chat technology.

1964
01:57:59,431 --> 01:58:00,990
We have increasingly sophisticated,

1965
01:58:00,991 --> 01:58:03,840
like you're not going to detect
that image somewhere else.

1966
01:58:03,870 --> 01:58:06,720
That old trick of like right click and
look and see if you're talking to someone

1967
01:58:06,721 --> 01:58:10,170
with a stock photo that goes right out
the window is stuff like this gets easier

1968
01:58:10,171 --> 01:58:14,430
and easier to do. Deep faking the
deep fakes on the video front.

1969
01:58:14,760 --> 01:58:16,680
I think that it does change.

1970
01:58:17,370 --> 01:58:22,370
I think we haven't quite adapted to what
is it like to live in a world where so

1971
01:58:22,951 --> 01:58:24,270
much of the Internet is fake.

1972
01:58:24,660 --> 01:58:29,040
And I do think per your point
about identity that there
will be groups of people

1973
01:58:29,041 --> 01:58:33,180
that self select into
communities where identity is
um, mandatory. You know, we're,

1974
01:58:33,210 --> 01:58:33,331
we're,

1975
01:58:33,331 --> 01:58:37,410
this is who you are and you have some
sort of verification versus people who

1976
01:58:37,411 --> 01:58:40,950
choose to live in the world of,
um, you know, drink from the fire,

1977
01:58:41,110 --> 01:58:44,380
take it all in and try to
filter it out yourself. Um,

1978
01:58:45,340 --> 01:58:50,340
so we look at these evolving
technologies and I don't necessarily feel

1979
01:58:53,520 --> 01:58:57,310
particularly optimistic in the short term.
I think that ultimately it does,

1980
01:58:57,610 --> 01:59:01,870
like we change as a society to a
large extent. And in response to this,

1981
01:59:01,871 --> 01:59:05,470
we think about, um, you know,

1982
01:59:05,500 --> 01:59:08,380
they're going to be some fixes that the
platforms are gonna be able to undertake.

1983
01:59:08,381 --> 01:59:11,350
They're going to be, we're going to get
better at detecting the stuff. Maybe,

1984
01:59:11,670 --> 01:59:12,880
you know,
the adversary will evolve.

1985
01:59:12,881 --> 01:59:15,820
Hopefully we get better at
detecting it as it evolves.

1986
01:59:15,821 --> 01:59:17,980
But it's,

1987
01:59:18,220 --> 01:59:21,140
I think we fundamentally
ultimately change.

1988
01:59:21,141 --> 01:59:24,700
Like people become more aware that this
is a thing. They are more skeptical, uh,

1989
01:59:24,701 --> 01:59:29,390
that does change are there are ways of
interacting with each other. Uh, but I,

1990
01:59:29,391 --> 01:59:32,860
I feel like that is going to be
the direction that this goes.

1991
01:59:33,450 --> 01:59:36,010
There's the more like,
you know,

1992
01:59:36,011 --> 01:59:39,010
the thing that keeps me up at
night would be more the, um,

1993
01:59:40,990 --> 01:59:41,830
the ease of,

1994
01:59:41,860 --> 01:59:46,120
of turning this from a social
media problem until like
a real world war problem.

1995
01:59:46,360 --> 01:59:49,180
Meaning, um, as an example,

1996
01:59:49,181 --> 01:59:52,900
back in 2014 when the first thing
is internet research agency dead,

1997
01:59:53,380 --> 01:59:57,250
September 11th, 2014,
they created a hoax, um,

1998
01:59:57,760 --> 02:00:02,230
saying that isis had attacked a chemical
plant down in Louisiana and it's called

1999
02:00:02,231 --> 02:00:05,680
the Columbia, the Columbia
Chemical Pr. Um, plant hoax is,

2000
02:00:05,681 --> 02:00:07,810
I think there's a Wikipedia
article about it now.

2001
02:00:08,290 --> 02:00:13,050
But what happened was they
created a collection of websites.

2002
02:00:13,060 --> 02:00:15,760
They created fake CNN mockups,
Twitter accounts,

2003
02:00:15,761 --> 02:00:19,690
text messages that went to local people,
radio station, Collins, you name it,

2004
02:00:19,691 --> 02:00:24,691
everything to create the impression that
a chemical factory had just exploded in

2005
02:00:25,720 --> 02:00:28,420
Louisiana.
And there was some attribution to isis.

2006
02:00:28,421 --> 02:00:30,010
And this was done on September 11th.

2007
02:00:30,430 --> 02:00:33,220
So this is the kind of thing
where this actually did go viral.

2008
02:00:33,250 --> 02:00:36,040
Like I remember this happening,
not as a social media researcher.

2009
02:00:36,041 --> 02:00:39,190
I just remember it actually being
pushed into my social media feed.

2010
02:00:39,580 --> 02:00:41,410
So you have these,
um,

2011
02:00:41,440 --> 02:00:44,710
and we didn't know that it
was the Internet research
agency for year and a half

2012
02:00:44,711 --> 02:00:45,544
after.

2013
02:00:45,970 --> 02:00:50,970
But this is the kind of thing where you
look at parts of the world that aren't

2014
02:00:51,011 --> 02:00:54,580
the u s like the recent, um,
drama between India and Pakistan.

2015
02:00:55,030 --> 02:00:57,670
And you can see how these kinds
of things can go horribly,

2016
02:00:57,671 --> 02:01:02,350
horribly wrong if the wrong person is
convinced that something has happened or

2017
02:01:02,351 --> 02:01:03,330
if there's a,
you know,

2018
02:01:03,400 --> 02:01:07,480
or if this leads to our riot or if
this leads to real world action.

2019
02:01:07,481 --> 02:01:11,860
I think that's, um, one of the main fears.

2020
02:01:11,861 --> 02:01:14,620
As this gets better and better,
the video fakes get better,

2021
02:01:14,621 --> 02:01:19,600
the people fakes get better. What,
you know, what do you do then?

2022
02:01:20,110 --> 02:01:20,943
So,

2023
02:01:20,970 --> 02:01:25,050
yeah, what do you do when you see those
images, those images, fake images.

2024
02:01:25,560 --> 02:01:30,210
Those are stunning. They're so good. I
mean, it just makes you wonder, I mean,

2025
02:01:30,260 --> 02:01:33,990
and we're going to get to a point where
if someone's not in front of you talking,

2026
02:01:34,230 --> 02:01:36,810
you're going to look at a video. You're
not going to have any idea. You know,

2027
02:01:36,811 --> 02:01:41,180
they're doing those deep fakes when were
famous faces and they put them in porn

2028
02:01:41,181 --> 02:01:45,770
films and it's, it's stunningly
good. I mean, it's a, it's amazing.

2029
02:01:45,800 --> 02:01:49,310
And they're there.
They're also with someone like me,

2030
02:01:49,311 --> 02:01:53,150
I'm fucking doomed because there's
thousands of hours of me talking.

2031
02:01:53,151 --> 02:01:57,350
I've said everything. Yeah. So
you could take this new, uh,

2032
02:01:57,530 --> 02:02:01,190
there's this new product programs that
are editing audio and you could splice

2033
02:02:01,191 --> 02:02:05,780
together audio and video. Now did I even
splice it? The computer will generate,

2034
02:02:05,781 --> 02:02:10,220
yeah, just, it's insane. It generates
your lip movements, everything. I mean,

2035
02:02:10,221 --> 02:02:12,080
it's really stunning.
It's really stunning.

2036
02:02:12,110 --> 02:02:15,560
And it's only gonna get
crazier and crazier and it's
going to be very difficult

2037
02:02:15,561 --> 02:02:18,860
to, unless something is actually
happening right in front of your face,

2038
02:02:19,100 --> 02:02:21,260
it's going to be very difficult
to be able to differentiate.

2039
02:02:22,120 --> 02:02:25,250
And then I'm more worried about augmented
reality and virtual reality and this

2040
02:02:25,251 --> 02:02:26,960
stuff making its way into it.

2041
02:02:26,961 --> 02:02:31,130
And when we're going to dive w w willingly
with a big smile on her face into the

2042
02:02:31,131 --> 02:02:31,964
majors.

2043
02:02:32,790 --> 02:02:34,510
Have you watched that
recently? No, I haven't.

2044
02:02:34,570 --> 02:02:38,760
I watched that on a plane like
a month ago or something. No,

2045
02:02:38,820 --> 02:02:42,500
it holds up really well. Top, like
it's, it's insane except for the, um,

2046
02:02:42,600 --> 02:02:44,090
except for the phone boots and so on.

2047
02:02:44,091 --> 02:02:48,630
One thing where like there's no fun
was anymore, but everything else is um,

2048
02:02:48,660 --> 02:02:52,050
wow. Yeah. It's, it's, I don't know
you as you've seen it recently.

2049
02:02:52,380 --> 02:02:57,380
I just bought it on four k cause like
I forgot and 99 there wasn't barely HD

2050
02:02:58,111 --> 02:03:01,830
back then and I just wanted to see what
it was like rewashed it forgot how good

2051
02:03:01,831 --> 02:03:05,190
it was. And two, two and a half
hours flew by the whole movie.

2052
02:03:05,620 --> 02:03:06,453
Yeah.
It's,

2053
02:03:06,730 --> 02:03:11,730
it's amazing how that seemed preposterous
in 99 or whatever it was like,

2054
02:03:13,151 --> 02:03:16,390
oh, this is just psi Phi
and now you're like, hey,

2055
02:03:16,780 --> 02:03:18,640
this is a little closer.

2056
02:03:19,360 --> 02:03:24,360
Like the idea of have you messed around
at all with like HTC vive or Oculus?

2057
02:03:25,680 --> 02:03:30,410
I, I tried, I was a VC briefly
like back in, back in, um,

2058
02:03:31,200 --> 02:03:35,820
five, six years ago now. And I tried
one from, um, I think it's USC, right?

2059
02:03:35,821 --> 02:03:38,130
Those southern California has a
bunch of really good labs down here.

2060
02:03:38,610 --> 02:03:42,900
And I tried one where it was like a
Zombie holodeck simulator and it was, um,

2061
02:03:42,930 --> 02:03:46,950
it wasn't just the Vr, it was also, it was
immersive. So they had a backpack on me.

2062
02:03:47,550 --> 02:03:52,290
Um, and it was, it was
actually scary as hell. Yeah.

2063
02:03:52,291 --> 02:03:55,710
I was like, this is really good. This
is, I like, I love first person shooters.

2064
02:03:55,711 --> 02:03:58,770
I think there's so much fun, but this
was just the first time or in the,

2065
02:03:58,771 --> 02:04:02,670
in the game you have like a
bat or something and you're
your lecture of beats on

2066
02:04:02,671 --> 02:04:05,850
piece together with the band and they're
like all up in your face. And um,

2067
02:04:06,570 --> 02:04:09,400
I don't know if that thing ever came
to market, but Dan was a good too. Well

2068
02:04:09,430 --> 02:04:10,810
they have a company called,

2069
02:04:11,410 --> 02:04:16,410
it's called the void now and they have
this a wreck it Ralph one and I did it

2070
02:04:16,631 --> 02:04:21,040
with my kids recently and you put on a
haptic feedback vest and you go through

2071
02:04:21,041 --> 02:04:23,680
this environment and it's crazy.
I mean you're,

2072
02:04:23,840 --> 02:04:27,820
it's very clear that you're in a
video game. It doesn't seem real,

2073
02:04:27,821 --> 02:04:32,340
but it is so much better than anything
that existed five years ago. And you go,

2074
02:04:32,360 --> 02:04:36,190
okay, well what is with the exponential
increase in power of technology,

2075
02:04:36,191 --> 02:04:37,650
what does this going to be like 10 years?

2076
02:04:37,920 --> 02:04:40,320
What's it going to be like in
15 it's going to be impossible.

2077
02:04:40,321 --> 02:04:42,600
Differentiate cause now it's a vest.

2078
02:04:42,601 --> 02:04:47,400
It's just a vest and not strapped
into a chair. He can move around.

2079
02:04:47,401 --> 02:04:50,010
So you're going through this whole
warehouse that they have set up for these

2080
02:04:50,011 --> 02:04:54,270
games and even picking up physical objects
and they look different in your hands

2081
02:04:54,271 --> 02:04:55,620
than they do when you,

2082
02:04:55,650 --> 02:04:59,790
when you look at them without the headgear
on centers for that, they have them.

2083
02:05:00,060 --> 02:05:03,870
I haven't been to, they have one
outside of Disneyland. It's in Disney,

2084
02:05:03,871 --> 02:05:08,220
downtown Disney. It's called the
void. And then you go into these,

2085
02:05:08,221 --> 02:05:13,020
this one star wars one is a wreck it
Ralph one now they have them in malls,

2086
02:05:13,710 --> 02:05:14,371
small ones.

2087
02:05:14,371 --> 02:05:18,450
You sit in these little eggs and you go
on rollercoaster rides and you fight off

2088
02:05:18,451 --> 02:05:20,100
zombies and go into a haunted house.

2089
02:05:20,490 --> 02:05:24,810
It's getting weird and it's just
that we're, we're, you know,

2090
02:05:25,440 --> 02:05:30,000
I was a kid when video games were
these ridiculous Atari things.

2091
02:05:30,001 --> 02:05:33,720
We stuck cartridges in and you're
playing pong and now we're looking at

2092
02:05:33,721 --> 02:05:38,340
something that you're looking at these
images of people you see pores you see

2093
02:05:38,341 --> 02:05:42,620
there, you see the, the glistening of
their lips, you see their eyes. It's,

2094
02:05:42,700 --> 02:05:44,010
it's very strange.

2095
02:05:44,040 --> 02:05:47,370
It's very strange to think that those
are not really people and that we are

2096
02:05:47,371 --> 02:05:49,840
probably going to look at the,

2097
02:05:50,490 --> 02:05:55,490
all you have to do is create something
that is so large and the propaganda,

2098
02:05:56,371 --> 02:06:00,240
the so terrifying that it causes
you to act without double checking,

2099
02:06:00,241 --> 02:06:03,330
triple checking and making sure you
verify the fact that something has really

2100
02:06:03,331 --> 02:06:07,830
happened and then it sets into motion
some physical act in the real world that

2101
02:06:07,831 --> 02:06:12,510
you can't pull back. Like, and this
is does not related necessarily,

2102
02:06:12,511 --> 02:06:17,511
but what happened with Hawaii when they
got that false warning that nuclear

2103
02:06:18,780 --> 02:06:20,070
missiles were headed their way,

2104
02:06:22,130 --> 02:06:25,890
he imagined it was crazy and it was
just someone hit the wrong button.

2105
02:06:26,160 --> 02:06:31,160
I mean if we come to some sort of a point
in time where someone does something

2106
02:06:32,881 --> 02:06:37,881
like that on purpose and shows you video
that you really think New York City

2107
02:06:37,891 --> 02:06:40,110
just got nuked and you know,

2108
02:06:40,111 --> 02:06:43,260
you have to head to the hills and there's
a giant traffic jam on the highway and

2109
02:06:43,261 --> 02:06:45,620
people start shooting
each other. I mean, if,

2110
02:06:45,750 --> 02:06:50,750
if Russia really wants to fuck with us
what they're doing now with just this,

2111
02:06:52,860 --> 02:06:53,310
you know,

2112
02:06:53,310 --> 02:06:58,310
this IRA agency and all of these different
trolls that they've got set up to

2113
02:06:58,820 --> 02:07:02,280
sort of trying to get people to get
being conflict with each other. This is,

2114
02:07:02,430 --> 02:07:07,290
this is with primitive
crude text and memes.

2115
02:07:09,150 --> 02:07:11,670
What could be done in the future.
It's terrifying,

2116
02:07:13,110 --> 02:07:17,820
but live in a weird world.
Yeah, we're in agreement.

2117
02:07:18,810 --> 02:07:22,320
Yup. Let's end it there. All right.
Thank you so much. Really appreciate it.

2118
02:07:22,321 --> 02:07:23,530
Thanks for coming down.
It was,

2119
02:07:23,730 --> 02:07:26,880
and thank you for all your work and
exposing all this stuff. It's really,

2120
02:07:26,881 --> 02:07:29,060
really interesting and terrifying.
Uh,

2121
02:07:29,070 --> 02:07:31,440
tell people how they can get ahold of
you so they control you on Twitter.

2122
02:07:32,730 --> 02:07:35,210
My handle is at no upside,
no upside.

2123
02:07:35,440 --> 02:07:38,950
And you don't necessarily have an
Instagram. It's more like family.

2124
02:07:38,951 --> 02:07:42,820
My instruments, my kids. Yeah. All right.
Thank you Renee. Really appreciate it.

2125
02:07:42,821 --> 02:07:43,810
Thank you.
Bye everybody.
