1
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:12,610
The Joe Rogan experience podcast by 
night.

2
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:21,440
I need a new song.
It's time.

3
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:27,230
600 episodes.
I think it's that you haven't had that 

4
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:27,630
for the first hundred.
Yeah,

5
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:30,120
whatever.
500 maybe.

6
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,620
It's great.
I love it.

7
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:33,000
I used to like the,
uh,

8
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:38,270
tell Nick Diaz that if he doesn't win 
then you've got to get a new theme song 

9
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:41,070
because I will never take his,
his voice off the theme song.

10
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,160
We'll do a neat new theme song and 
incorporate his voice.

11
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:46,080
That was the one of the coolest moments 
in my life.

12
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:50,130
You kidding me?
He's got his hands up in the air.

13
00:00:50,131 --> 00:00:52,630
It's like train by day Joe Rogan podcast
by night.

14
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:57,770
I was like,
that's the coolest thing that's ever 

15
00:00:57,770 --> 00:00:57,770
happened to me next to the birth of my 
children.

16
00:00:57,980 --> 00:00:59,150
It's right up there.
Wow.

17
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:03,060
So,
uh,

18
00:01:03,061 --> 00:01:06,540
we're all here because we're friends and
this is an intervention Dunkin.

19
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:10,260
I know you thought this was a podcast 
masturbating.

20
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:11,280
You're gonna.
You're gonna.

21
00:01:11,281 --> 00:01:16,250
Have to tell them about the demons.
Tell them what happens when.

22
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:19,710
I don't know if we know those Jews.
Know that when people masturbate,

23
00:01:19,711 --> 00:01:23,400
they're actually fucking beaman.
That's on top of you that you can't even

24
00:01:23,401 --> 00:01:28,401
see when you come.
It comes into her belly and you have 

25
00:01:28,401 --> 00:01:30,291
demon babies.
The only way to get the Jews out of my 

26
00:01:30,291 --> 00:01:32,781
body as to jerk off Jews really bleeding
and the only way to get the juice out of

27
00:01:33,001 --> 00:01:35,750
your body is a jerk off.
Oh,

28
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:40,760
you have to get possessed by demons and 
they swell up in my chest and they 

29
00:01:42,211 --> 00:01:46,620
caused my penis to expand and to change 
shape.

30
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:51,800
You know what I'm talking about?
When inside of a shape,

31
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,450
it's very strange.
I've seen that comes like this.

32
00:01:55,470 --> 00:02:00,470
Tape up marshmallow guy so you get 
demons to sexy movie.

33
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:05,670
The only thing that gets the demon out 
is if I jerk off a Semitic man,

34
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:11,170
then when I do that,
I see the demon come out of my penis in 

35
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:12,600
the form of this white,
salty substance.

36
00:02:12,601 --> 00:02:16,350
Either it goes back to normal.
Your penis stays like crazy,

37
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:21,240
crazy aggressive.
It's always screaming howling at night.

38
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:26,260
So we're here.
This is not happening.

39
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:30,420
The new show on comedy central or should
fear officially a baller,

40
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:33,240
just had his new comedy central hour 
special,

41
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:35,760
paid regular and that was the coolest 
shit man.

42
00:02:35,761 --> 00:02:40,761
The comedy store was tweeting photos of 
the red band tweeted some to of the 

43
00:02:40,761 --> 00:02:41,330
patio,
the field.

44
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:47,080
Everybody out there watching your 
special on tv while you were performing 

45
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:47,850
in the or.
That was the craziest picture.

46
00:02:47,851 --> 00:02:52,851
Jeff Scott Show Shit onstage live at 
this store and on standby special was 

47
00:02:54,991 --> 00:02:57,740
from that same stage and you know what's
even cooler?

48
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,340
People come to see you now.
I think your new material now.

49
00:03:00,341 --> 00:03:05,341
Some of the best shit you've ever done.
It's right up there with the best bits 

50
00:03:05,341 --> 00:03:05,341
you've ever done.
The new show that you're doing now.

51
00:03:05,341 --> 00:03:07,840
That stuff you did in Vegas.
It's fucking great man.

52
00:03:07,841 --> 00:03:10,470
It's really funny.
Shit without telling anybody to have it.

53
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:13,270
Say a good eight minutes.
Eight minutes.

54
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:17,050
That's all right dude.
Keep swinging.

55
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:22,710
I'm really good about 40 right now,
but it's 40 that I don't.

56
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,800
I don't know it that well.
That was still a ever evolving like 

57
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,810
these,
like Jarvis Jarvis,

58
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:31,930
Jarvis.
He's just say the bits where like,

59
00:03:31,931 --> 00:03:36,931
I'm like cooling metal or cooling honey,
so it was like real fluid and then as it

60
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:42,270
gets cooler it like more and more shape 
until it becomes like the same thing 

61
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:42,270
every time.
It's cool.

62
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:42,270
Yeah.
I remember that.

63
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:46,950
I never,
I don't remember total talent 

64
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:46,950
coordinator.
You told me that.

65
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:49,980
That's an interesting way to look at it.
I've always felt that they grow though 

66
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,100
always felt that there are living thing 
and it becomes sturdy.

67
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:53,920
Like they started off as like little 
saplings and they're like,

68
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:58,980
oh,
sometimes they look impressive and 

69
00:03:58,980 --> 00:03:58,980
sometimes they come.
Sometimes they come out,

70
00:03:58,980 --> 00:03:58,980
they're fucking trees.

71
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:03,840
There's certain bits that I've done that
we're already a tree before they ever 

72
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,680
got to the stage,
like the Vegan bit.

73
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:09,690
That was just on my last special.
I wrote that bit all after one 

74
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:10,240
conversation.
Did you name that bit?

75
00:04:10,241 --> 00:04:14,110
Jamie Kilstein to Jv.
Kelsey and Jamie Kilstein,

76
00:04:14,111 --> 00:04:17,140
believe it or not,
even though he talks a lot about being a

77
00:04:17,141 --> 00:04:22,141
Vegan,
he's not preachy about it and he also 

78
00:04:22,141 --> 00:04:22,141
admits it.
He ate a lot of meat.

79
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:27,540
He's a bad example that Jamie Chelsea 
gets a bad rap and part of it's because 

80
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:28,840
the conversation that he and I had on 
the show,

81
00:04:28,841 --> 00:04:32,410
but he's not,
he's not a bad conversation.

82
00:04:32,411 --> 00:04:33,640
I don't remember if he's out there 
listening.

83
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,270
Jamie Kilstein.
I think you're a good dude.

84
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,270
I really do.
I think he's a,

85
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:39,890
he's a genuinely like what he's trying 
to do.

86
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:43,940
He genuinely thinks he's doing really 
good things and he's just,

87
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:48,680
it was about the um,
the Daniel Tosh rape thing.

88
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:54,290
Daddy touched me that joke where he 
asked the audience what they wanted to 

89
00:04:55,281 --> 00:05:00,281
talk about.
Some guy yells out rape and Daniel Tosh 

90
00:05:00,281 --> 00:05:00,620
start saying like,
oh yeah,

91
00:05:00,621 --> 00:05:01,460
what a great subject.
Like,

92
00:05:01,461 --> 00:05:04,760
what's so funny about rape is it,
the humiliation is the violence.

93
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,700
Some woman says,
actually,

94
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:09,890
nothing is funny about rape.
And he goes,

95
00:05:09,891 --> 00:05:11,870
wouldn't it be funny if five guys just 
rape her right now?

96
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:14,740
And it became this big,
sent me.

97
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:15,320
Well,
first of all,

98
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:18,440
that's the kind of shit that happens at 
a goddamn comedy club.

99
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:19,820
No,
we all know that.

100
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:24,350
And the guy's just trying to be funny 
while he's on his toes.

101
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:27,870
On a stage in the spur of the moment,
that's what to me it's like a non issue,

102
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:33,230
so jamie and I disagreed with it heavily
because he felt like the lazy and he 

103
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:34,880
felt like your contributed to rape 
culture,

104
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:38,820
which is a term that gets bandied about.
It's a.

105
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:42,560
it's a weird term.
Some people think it's horse shit term,

106
00:05:42,561 --> 00:05:44,150
you know?
There is no rape culture.

107
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:49,550
The real thing.
That's why if you say the Indian comics 

108
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:49,640
from India and stuff,
they're super rape joke.

109
00:05:49,641 --> 00:05:52,710
He comes out and they're consistent gang
rapes.

110
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:53,590
No,
that's all.

111
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:58,690
That's pretty much all our comics just 
talk about rape and gang rape and then 

112
00:05:58,690 --> 00:05:58,690
it

113
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:03,250
really in the ecommerce peters from 
Houston,

114
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,920
they're Indians.
They're brown is fuck barrier.

115
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:18,020
Our Indian garment for sure,
until they have a seat stay.

116
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:23,380
There's giant movie industry.
Their movie industry is bigger than our 

117
00:06:24,321 --> 00:06:25,790
movie and Super Porny,
right.

118
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:31,080
It's not always long sex scenes and 
those considered juggling a fruit and 

119
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:35,231
singing in between a gun fighting movies
still have a musical numbers where they 

120
00:06:37,701 --> 00:06:40,070
will start in the middle of a real 
action movie.

121
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:45,250
When I went to,
we would take volume and go to this 

122
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:49,421
movie theater in New Delhi and just 
watch their movies because there's so 

123
00:06:49,421 --> 00:06:49,421
trippy.
But yeah,

124
00:06:49,421 --> 00:06:51,360
in the middle of like an action movie,
uh,

125
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:56,210
it'll stop and do a musical number that,
like a real serious action movie.

126
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:58,550
Why?
It's just their culture did like it.

127
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:03,640
They like it.
They like that style of to will mean we 

128
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:03,640
used to like it.

129
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,780
And if you go back and try to watch 
those old Oklahoma,

130
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:08,270
well all those,
like gene Kelly movies,

131
00:07:08,271 --> 00:07:13,271
there was start dancing in the streets,
but he would stand there and people 

132
00:07:13,271 --> 00:07:16,361
would dance around them and they had 
music videos at broke out in the middle 

133
00:07:16,361 --> 00:07:17,330
of a movie.
So they have also applied to put it.

134
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,890
Yeah.
They have all these plots.

135
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:22,010
They have real language.
They're real dialogue.

136
00:07:22,011 --> 00:07:27,011
They have a real storyline.
You see like why there wouldn't be 

137
00:07:27,011 --> 00:07:31,521
singing about,
well,

138
00:07:32,901 --> 00:07:36,260
it's someone's desire,
the one person's desire in the middle of

139
00:07:36,261 --> 00:07:38,630
a gigantic performance where people are 
interacting with each other.

140
00:07:38,631 --> 00:07:41,390
It's one person's desire to totally 
steal the spotlight.

141
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:46,720
And the best way to do that is by saying
everybody has to stand around and listen

142
00:07:47,601 --> 00:07:50,000
while John,
like we're all like support.

143
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:53,010
We're in the back and John's in the 
century snapping.

144
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:58,110
Yeah.
And he's got this great point and we're 

145
00:07:58,110 --> 00:07:58,110
all like,
wow,

146
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:01,151
yeah,
senior angle above live and everyone's 

147
00:08:01,151 --> 00:08:03,830
letting him move around and nobody stops
and go,

148
00:08:03,831 --> 00:08:08,831
what are you fucking doing man?
Like why are you saying like nobody 

149
00:08:08,831 --> 00:08:08,831
interacts with them.
There's no interacting.

150
00:08:08,831 --> 00:08:12,470
It's just this one guy,
which is what the theater to some folks.

151
00:08:12,471 --> 00:08:15,700
It's all about that moment on stage 
holding the stoll.

152
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:18,710
Who Got Paul?
Reminds me,

153
00:08:18,711 --> 00:08:20,450
man,
I got a million dollar idea.

154
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:24,620
What's a found footage musical like this
found footage?

155
00:08:24,621 --> 00:08:29,621
Movies.
But they find one where like people are 

156
00:08:29,621 --> 00:08:31,901
actually real music.
You know,

157
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,650
music is playing.
They just start saying,

158
00:08:35,651 --> 00:08:36,250
hey,
like what?

159
00:08:36,251 --> 00:08:40,160
The flare.
That will be great.

160
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:44,360
Really bad songs.
But Linda's choppy video,

161
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:47,720
it's totally happening right now.
I've got another.

162
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:52,780
I've got a great idea to do with it of 
an improvised musical reality show,

163
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,240
but they gotta

164
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:57,570
do it.
That's a great idea.

165
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:02,880
That's a great idea to bring them into a
situation and the audience doesn't know,

166
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:09,770
so they have to.
They're are people going to interact 

167
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:11,270
with them to sing out to this restaurant
or bar?

168
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:16,850
Have you ever seen the video?
There's a video with this bringing you 

169
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:18,480
back to a activists that get that.
Sometimes ms dot point.

170
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:23,750
There was a video of this lady,
she steps into a chicken restaurant and 

171
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:24,900
she starts talking about this is not 
food,

172
00:09:24,901 --> 00:09:26,740
this is violence,
you know,

173
00:09:26,741 --> 00:09:30,990
and there's a little girl and her saying
and she just wants to live.

174
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:36,140
She just wants to be happy and she just 
wants to live and this little girl was 

175
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:40,011
going to die just like all of her 
sisters and all of her brothers and her 

176
00:09:40,011 --> 00:09:41,820
family chicken a chicken and she rescued
this,

177
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:46,880
this chicken.
And so she just like videos of the same 

178
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,060
gal with her chicken at home,
you know,

179
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:48,560
it's like.

180
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:54,270
So she goes into a restaurant and 
disrupts all these people and like tells

181
00:09:54,271 --> 00:09:59,271
this whole story and then explains that 
it's hurt our chicken and then a whole 

182
00:09:59,271 --> 00:10:01,260
crew of assholes come in behind her with
signs.

183
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:03,840
This is not food.
It's violence.

184
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,280
It's so weird.
And they're like,

185
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:09,540
we're just running a restaurant.
Did it seems like a parody.

186
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:14,541
It seems like someone is just bad ass.
Some Tim and Eric type dude really just 

187
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:16,680
put together some bad ass parody that's 
so subtle.

188
00:10:16,681 --> 00:10:21,681
You like not sure like is this bitch 
really this crazy that she's referring 

189
00:10:21,681 --> 00:10:22,770
to this chicken as her girl?

190
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:28,170
So it seems sometimes that like 
activists aren't aware of the fact that 

191
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:32,270
if they're stumped isn't pulled off in 
the right way.

192
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:36,440
It seems like it could be more 
detrimental comes off course,

193
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:37,670
you know,
like people will,

194
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:42,820
their response is going to be too rude 
to eat more chicken people.

195
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:44,180
Yeah.
Just because you're like,

196
00:10:44,181 --> 00:10:49,181
I don't want to be associated with this 
kind of behavior and if that means 

197
00:10:49,181 --> 00:10:51,530
eating chicken,
then I guess I'll eat more chicken.

198
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:56,980
So it's like it's,
it's dangerous to be an activist if you 

199
00:10:57,111 --> 00:11:01,370
are not really subtle or if you're 
aren't skillful in what you're doing.

200
00:11:01,371 --> 00:11:04,430
Like being an activist is awesome.
Just make sure that you're graceful when

201
00:11:04,431 --> 00:11:04,910
you do it

202
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:05,780
well.
Not only that,

203
00:11:05,781 --> 00:11:10,781
you have to have a real objective sense 
of what actions you're putting out there

204
00:11:11,091 --> 00:11:13,310
and how those actions are going to be 
perceived.

205
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:16,040
If you fake it,
you can see through and it seems lame.

206
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:21,070
Well,
there's some people that have this idea 

207
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:22,541
that their idea,
what they're protesting against is more 

208
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:24,990
important than anything that's going to 
disrupt anything that's going to involve

209
00:11:24,991 --> 00:11:29,991
that.
Like Greenpeace Greenpeace did with the 

210
00:11:29,991 --> 00:11:29,991
Nazca lines.
Oh yeah.

211
00:11:29,991 --> 00:11:33,500
They fucked him up so fucking crazy.
He's dumb ass holes.

212
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:36,380
Went to the Nazca lines and they set up 
a graph,

213
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:37,830
looks unethical,
Nazca lines.

214
00:11:37,831 --> 00:11:40,100
So these,
they don't even know how old they are.

215
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,140
Okay?
There are thousands of years old.

216
00:11:42,141 --> 00:11:43,850
These law.
Meanwhile I'm like,

217
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:48,920
because we know how old they are.
You just revealed that you're an 

218
00:11:49,071 --> 00:11:54,071
immortal.
They've dated more than a thousand 

219
00:11:54,071 --> 00:11:54,071
years.
Whatever it is.

220
00:11:54,071 --> 00:11:54,160
They're all sorts

221
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,590
of geometric patterns,
animals,

222
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:59,050
all sorts of different things.
Some of them are animals,

223
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:02,290
some of them are spiders were all these 
weird patterns you can only see from the

224
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:03,790
sky patterns.
Okay,

225
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:08,820
I'm sorry.
So there are patterns that are in their 

226
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:11,780
patterns are made on these flat plains 
and some of them are just a bunch of 

227
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:15,931
rocks that are pieced together in these 
lines and people have left them 

228
00:12:15,931 --> 00:12:19,030
undisturbed because they're so cool 
forever.

229
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:22,000
So you can't just go there and walk 
around on them.

230
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:27,030
You can't fuck these assholes went there
and they use some of the stones as 

231
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:31,440
paperweights.
They pick some of the rocks on the 

232
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,191
ground or they go to sign up this 
fucking stupid green peace sign.

233
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:35,610
Oh,
see that?

234
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:36,850
Pull it.
You got a photo of it,

235
00:12:36,851 --> 00:12:38,590
Jamie?
Put up with Dick's.

236
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:40,750
Yeah,
but so douchey.

237
00:12:40,751 --> 00:12:44,020
And because a lot of what Greenpeace 
does is really good,

238
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:48,940
which stop people from killing whales.
Remember lines of just.

239
00:12:48,941 --> 00:12:50,620
There's photos.
Jamie go to photos.

240
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:55,740
Greenpeace Nazca lines the seal outside 
of a store.

241
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:58,810
GRANDPA's.
So look what these assholes did.

242
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,780
See,
see how cool that that design is,

243
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:05,060
that pattern,
that pattern has been there for.

244
00:13:05,061 --> 00:13:06,720
That just naturally happened in the 
time.

245
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,600
Oh right.
And they were,

246
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:13,660
they were using stones from that to put 
their sign with the,

247
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:16,220
with the foot thing.
So they weren't disturbing people.

248
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:19,190
I don't know what the fuck they think 
they're doing.

249
00:13:19,191 --> 00:13:21,620
They're still disturbing it by doing 
that.

250
00:13:21,621 --> 00:13:23,390
Like sometimes standing on that,
look,

251
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:25,790
you're fucking footprints are also in 
that paper.

252
00:13:25,791 --> 00:13:28,100
I could see the bottom of your tread.
You know what that means.

253
00:13:28,101 --> 00:13:29,990
That means you stand.
You stood on that shit.

254
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:35,620
You stood on that shit somewhere and I'm
supposed to believe that you're doing 

255
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:36,530
this all ethically.
You're not fighting fire.

256
00:13:36,531 --> 00:13:38,120
They shouldn't have done that.
It backfired.

257
00:13:38,121 --> 00:13:43,121
And that sucks because all the people 
who are doing good work look like 

258
00:13:43,121 --> 00:13:44,270
assholes.
Exactly.

259
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:46,130
That sucks.
Yeah.

260
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,120
Okay.

261
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:52,180
So this is,
this is the actual of those are the 

262
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:52,240
lines like that?
Yeah.

263
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:53,300
Yeah.
What makes them.

264
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:55,910
We don't know.
They don't know who made them.

265
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:59,780
They really don't know that shit.
Wow.

266
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:00,740
That kid.
That's not,

267
00:14:00,741 --> 00:14:03,710
that's not just like movement,
like a kinetic movement.

268
00:14:03,711 --> 00:14:04,670
Right?
Oh No,

269
00:14:04,671 --> 00:14:05,120
no,
no,

270
00:14:05,121 --> 00:14:05,540
no,
no.

271
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:07,580
These are mad that someone.
Definitely.

272
00:14:07,581 --> 00:14:08,750
Definitely.
Without a doubt.

273
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:13,550
Is that in sand or is that in stone?
This is so funny.

274
00:14:13,551 --> 00:14:18,551
Some people think that the geometric 
ones could be indicated flow of water 

275
00:14:18,551 --> 00:14:20,450
that's connected to rituals to summon 
water.

276
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:21,920
Spiders,
birds,

277
00:14:21,921 --> 00:14:23,810
plants.
Could be fertility symbols.

278
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:28,910
Other possible explanations include a 
irrigation schemes or giant astronomical

279
00:14:28,911 --> 00:14:33,911
calendars.
Why isn't everyone trying to figure it 

280
00:14:33,911 --> 00:14:33,911
out?
That looks like a bird.

281
00:14:33,911 --> 00:14:33,911
Yeah,
well they're definitely trying to figure

282
00:14:33,911 --> 00:14:34,460
it out.
There's a dog.

283
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,920
There's a monkey.
The monkey.

284
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,630
No,
pull up the monkey.

285
00:14:38,631 --> 00:14:39,020
Jeremy.

286
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:43,380
They're so good.
There's a date.

287
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:46,560
There's a sport.
There's this binder that looks like.

288
00:14:46,561 --> 00:14:47,880
What's his name?
If you,

289
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:53,780
you'll find you'll find a monkey down 
there and there's a monkey and one of 

290
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:53,780
them.
It's really cool.

291
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:53,980
It's got like A.
There's a,

292
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:57,470
there's birds which bird feet and shit.
There's a gang of.

293
00:14:57,471 --> 00:15:00,260
I didn't bill cosby and ecstasy get 
makes them like that.

294
00:15:00,261 --> 00:15:03,040
It's weird to see the images that 
people.

295
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:08,020
Do you remember when they used to do 
that with a.

296
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:10,930
whether they would code certain words in
the websites.

297
00:15:10,931 --> 00:15:13,190
It's like a person that porn porn porn.
Funny,

298
00:15:13,191 --> 00:15:15,140
funny.
People think it's an alien.

299
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:16,940
That thing,
that person with the eyeball,

300
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:17,990
so click on that.

301
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:20,720
Well,
yeah,

302
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:23,360
but I mean that's how my daughter draws 
people.

303
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:27,740
You know,
everybody says it's an alien.

304
00:15:27,741 --> 00:15:28,880
It's an alien.
Well,

305
00:15:28,881 --> 00:15:33,260
maybe maybe somebody might be a giant 
two year old,

306
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:38,530
might be really shitty artists for 
thousands of years.

307
00:15:38,661 --> 00:15:40,310
The shitty artists,
the jetty.

308
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:43,150
Like I had this conversation with this 
dude who was trying to tell me,

309
00:15:43,151 --> 00:15:45,470
but you know,
these images on cave walls,

310
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,440
we're,
we're,

311
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,420
you know,
aliens,

312
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:49,760
depictions,
valence like Graham Hancock,

313
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:51,350
who I love.
But it was like,

314
00:15:51,351 --> 00:15:52,940
come on man,
I might not be an alien.

315
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:54,980
That can be a lot of shit.
These people,

316
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:57,470
if they want to believe in,
and not only that,

317
00:15:57,471 --> 00:16:02,471
but it was thousands of years ago.
Just what they saw back then was aliens.

318
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:08,000
That's when they pull up the monkey,
Jamie,

319
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:13,360
and you just see this monkey see monkey 
because it's really cool.

320
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,740
It's got a curly tail is go down a 
little bit,

321
00:16:15,741 --> 00:16:17,990
go down a little bit more and more and 
more and more and more and more.

322
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:21,210
Start up a little up.

323
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:22,680
We got it.
It's gone.

324
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,890
It was a dog to the left.
Do you see that?

325
00:16:25,891 --> 00:16:26,910
One of the far left,
Jamie.

326
00:16:26,911 --> 00:16:28,620
About three down.
Oh,

327
00:16:28,621 --> 00:16:30,870
it's okay.
Just let's try to find a monkey.

328
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:35,390
Whereas that monkey.
Where's the fucking monkey?

329
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:37,680
The monkey from us?
No.

330
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:39,990
Well,
if you go to the Wikipedia,

331
00:16:39,991 --> 00:16:43,090
you could see the month.
Here's the cool.

332
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:48,230
Here it is.
So it's like it's puking or it's on the 

333
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:49,230
wikipedia.
If you go to the Wikipedia,

334
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:50,410
look at them like,
oh,

335
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:53,930
that'll look.
You can see it there.

336
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:58,080
It's enormous.
How big is a person to toe?

337
00:16:58,770 --> 00:17:00,360
I don't know.
That's a good question.

338
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:03,480
That's a very good question,
but they're really big.

339
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:08,840
I mean you,
you see when those people were walking 

340
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:08,840
around,
I mean digitally,

341
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:13,050
they were laying that out.
It looks like it was drawn like with a 

342
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:16,011
finger on a tablet or something.
It doesn't look like a shit ton of 

343
00:17:16,011 --> 00:17:18,720
people spend a long time look.
The tail kind of wore out.

344
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:21,450
They've had some damage with mud slugs 
to apparently.

345
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:23,280
Yeah,
they.

346
00:17:23,281 --> 00:17:24,330
But they,
they really.

347
00:17:24,331 --> 00:17:27,090
There's all sorts of explanations,
but nobody goes there.

348
00:17:27,091 --> 00:17:30,190
They just look at it and then the 
Greenpeace people want.

349
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:33,870
They're aliens came,
visited these people,

350
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:36,450
gave them like showed them some 
incredible shit.

351
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,420
They left.
The people want them to come back.

352
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:43,220
So they draw these shapes on the ground 
and hoping that our attorney,

353
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:46,890
it's classic cargo cult behavior.
That's where it all is right in the same

354
00:17:46,891 --> 00:17:48,550
place in Peru.
Yeah.

355
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:49,650
Yeah.
This one area,

356
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:55,580
it's really fascinating also because 
there's what looked like landing strips 

357
00:17:55,801 --> 00:17:59,550
there as long parallel lines.
They want them to come back.

358
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:00,870
That's what it is.
That's got to be.

359
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:04,490
That's what it is.
Doesn't have to be.

360
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,090
It could be.
They just know.

361
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:11,350
They just figured out how to draw it in 
the ground that you can see from the 

362
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:13,741
sky.
Maybe they just thought it was an 

363
00:18:13,741 --> 00:18:13,741
interesting way to do something that 
they couldn't see your will.

364
00:18:13,741 --> 00:18:15,930
They could.
They just couldn't see it really well,

365
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:18,570
you know,
you can only really truly see what it is

366
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:22,110
when you're up above it,
but I mean it's not impossible that they

367
00:18:22,111 --> 00:18:23,880
could measure it and do it all on the 
ground.

368
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:26,790
I'm just proposing being the devil's 
advocate,

369
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:28,800
like it's not impossible that they did 
those.

370
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,750
You could see the ground.
I mean,

371
00:18:30,751 --> 00:18:32,100
you're looking down at your feet.

372
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,170
It's not like you're invisible to you to
help.

373
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:40,090
You do like 12 mile wide monkey sabic.
They're not that big.

374
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:44,130
They're not that big.
They're a few hundred feet wide.

375
00:18:44,131 --> 00:18:49,131
I think the really big ones,
but there's not like 12 miles long or 

376
00:18:49,131 --> 00:18:51,711
anything crazy.
Maybe I do it the lines themselves or 

377
00:18:51,711 --> 00:18:55,450
they're superficial.
They're only 10 to 30 centimeters deep 

378
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:58,820
and could be washed away really.
So that's why nobody goes there because 

379
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:02,541
I'll wear it down.
It's only ever received a very small 

380
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:05,241
amount of rain,
but there's issues also that the great 

381
00:19:05,241 --> 00:19:06,930
changes that we're seeing to the climate
that it might start raining.

382
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:12,190
They're not fucked crops.
Well,

383
00:19:12,191 --> 00:19:17,191
at least you know,
everybody's like really hooked up crops 

384
00:19:17,191 --> 00:19:20,920
ever,
but everyone will be better than the 

385
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:20,920
stupid lines.
Right.

386
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:24,060
But everybody's really localized.
They have it in their head that,

387
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:25,080
you know,
this,

388
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:26,970
um,
that this site is like,

389
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:28,710
it's super important.

390
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:31,230
But we have all the images,
like once we have the images,

391
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:33,450
if the water comes in,
washed everything away,

392
00:19:33,451 --> 00:19:37,470
at least at least we've documented.
We know these people made these things.

393
00:19:37,471 --> 00:19:42,471
We don't know why or when,
where they think it's the nascar 

394
00:19:42,471 --> 00:19:42,471
culture,
which is like,

395
00:19:42,471 --> 00:19:45,100
I think it said here,
400 to 650 add.

396
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:48,870
So they lived there and maybe carve 
those things they think.

397
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:51,290
So that's over a thousand years ago.
That's,

398
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:53,300
you know,
more than it as,

399
00:19:53,301 --> 00:19:56,820
as much as 1500 years ago.
Go to work and show it could be longer.

400
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Crazy shit man.
They don't really have any explanation 

401
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:02,640
for why.
But there's a lot of.

402
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:03,280
I mean,
you could,

403
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:04,320
it could be aliens,
right?

404
00:20:04,321 --> 00:20:06,510
I mean if we can go to Mars,
man,

405
00:20:06,511 --> 00:20:07,920
we can send a robot.
Tomorrow's.

406
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:11,400
It's so arrogant to think that we're the
only ones that could do that.

407
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:16,430
I've never seen any evidence whatsoever 
that's even remotely compelling that 

408
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:17,250
aliens have visited here.

409
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:18,690
None of it.
None of it.

410
00:20:18,691 --> 00:20:23,040
That's outside of other.
There's not one thing that stands out.

411
00:20:23,041 --> 00:20:28,041
We say that had to be aliens.
It couldn't have just been really smart 

412
00:20:28,041 --> 00:20:31,161
people.
Now one thing and why would any of them 

413
00:20:31,161 --> 00:20:31,161
left anything?
Well,

414
00:20:31,161 --> 00:20:31,600
it might've.
It might've when,

415
00:20:31,601 --> 00:20:36,090
when we're looking at the pyramids,
when we might be looking at is someone's

416
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,910
knowledge and information from another 
culture.

417
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:42,750
Well done.
The pyramids somehow point to serious,

418
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,550
serious sort of,
sort of.

419
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:49,610
Well it depends.
He said there's a thing called the 

420
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:49,610
procession of the.
So the earth spins.

421
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:49,610
Yeah,
right.

422
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:50,190
You know,
it's like,

423
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:55,200
it's,
there's like a wobble to the earth and 

424
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:55,200
so when you see this,
the stars,

425
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,010
it's not always the same and it,
it wobbles like,

426
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:00,310
you know,
every x amount of thousands of years.

427
00:21:00,311 --> 00:21:04,480
So depending upon where you think these 
were constructed,

428
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:06,410
you would have a different star line.

429
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,080
You'd have a different thing that you 
would see.

430
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:13,030
There is a guy named John Anthony West 
who's just amazing when it comes to this

431
00:21:13,031 --> 00:21:15,220
shit,
his whole video series.

432
00:21:15,221 --> 00:21:18,640
It's called magical Egypt.
So good if you've never been.

433
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:21,430
I mean it's like if you're not even 
interested at all in Egypt,

434
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:21,730
like,
yeah,

435
00:21:21,731 --> 00:21:26,731
that's fucking boring.
Bunch of people living in the sand like 

436
00:21:26,731 --> 00:21:27,850
assholes if you want,
if you want one of these videos.

437
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:33,600
I would love it if I was high.
I was just trying to be funny.

438
00:21:33,821 --> 00:21:35,270
I would say that.
But um,

439
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,000
his videos are super in depth about the 
construction methods and how big it is 

440
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:45,760
and like all the magical things about 
the way they built them,

441
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:49,990
they think that it was a culture that 
lived a long fucking time before.

442
00:21:49,991 --> 00:21:52,910
We think not just like $2,500
per se,

443
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:54,630
but like he's of uh,
the,

444
00:21:54,631 --> 00:21:56,920
the,
the notion that it's like 10,000

445
00:21:56,921 --> 00:22:01,921
plus BC and if you go to 10,000
BC apparently where the lion is a 

446
00:22:02,381 --> 00:22:07,381
sphinx,
where it's pointing would be directly 

447
00:22:07,381 --> 00:22:07,381
over the Constellation Leo.

448
00:22:07,381 --> 00:22:09,510
Oh,
I like the serious theory.

449
00:22:09,511 --> 00:22:13,800
Better the dog star.
It's like Robert Anton Wilson.

450
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:15,600
Crazy idea that,
uh,

451
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:21,440
that we are possibly currently existing 
in the serious star cluster in what 

452
00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:31,370
we're having this experience of reality 
pumped into our consciousness as a form 

453
00:22:31,591 --> 00:22:35,160
of training for something like Matrix 
pods,

454
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,650
pods,
and that there is like,

455
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:42,800
so there's like clues left in the 
simulator pointing back home and just to

456
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:46,110
just as a little cookie like you even 
video games,

457
00:22:46,111 --> 00:22:51,111
you know,
or maybe people a long time ago or more 

458
00:22:51,111 --> 00:22:54,261
aware of the fact that this is a inner 
interdimensional academy at kind of 

459
00:22:54,601 --> 00:22:58,710
hogwarts for young God links who are 
trying to like,

460
00:22:58,711 --> 00:23:01,650
who have the potential to become like 
universe creators.

461
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:05,340
But before they're elise to like create 
their own dimensions.

462
00:23:05,341 --> 00:23:09,240
They have to go through this infinite 
loop again and again and again until you

463
00:23:09,241 --> 00:23:14,241
learn that the most important thing is 
to love the people around you more than 

464
00:23:14,241 --> 00:23:14,241
you love yourself.
And then boom,

465
00:23:14,241 --> 00:23:15,960
and then you can be a god.
Well,

466
00:23:15,961 --> 00:23:20,961
yeah,
then you can then we can trust you to 

467
00:23:20,961 --> 00:23:20,961
fuck around with like our black hole 
machine or whatever.

468
00:23:20,961 --> 00:23:25,760
I'm not going to put you in charge of 
black holes while you're a selfish 

469
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,030
shithead.

470
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,640
Yeah.
That always seems to me like if that was

471
00:23:28,641 --> 00:23:32,810
really like a plot,
if someone had designed like people with

472
00:23:32,811 --> 00:23:34,820
this sort of like puzzle in front of 
them,

473
00:23:34,821 --> 00:23:38,000
the plot is eventually they're going to 
get intelligent enough to figure out the

474
00:23:38,001 --> 00:23:43,001
plot.
That seems to me to be like a really 

475
00:23:43,001 --> 00:23:44,500
shitty way of doing things.
There's God that's like various.

476
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:46,670
Tell them how do it.
It's very godlike.

477
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:47,760
Yeah.
It's very good.

478
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:52,810
Lord.
Eventually just tell me that's the only 

479
00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:55,661
way to teach kids in that sense.
Eventually that confusion that people 

480
00:23:55,661 --> 00:23:58,040
feel of the existential angst of being a
person.

481
00:23:58,041 --> 00:24:00,110
We don't know what the fuck you are.
Where are you going?

482
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:04,820
What happens when I die?
Like almost universally that needs to be

483
00:24:04,821 --> 00:24:09,821
plugged up.
Whether it's plugged up with this alien 

484
00:24:09,821 --> 00:24:11,430
story or whether it's plugged up with a,
you know,

485
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,140
a Mormon story.
What happened?

486
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,750
You just got to plug it up.
Yes.

487
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:22,090
That aching feeling of terror that like 
some people that's meant that.

488
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,590
What are we doing here?
What are we doing here though?

489
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,310
I understand they,
there's a,

490
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:27,530
there's a great,
uh,

491
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:31,780
existentialist philosopher slash author 
Khumbu.

492
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:33,710
You ever heard?
Of course horse.

493
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:36,360
I haven't heard of.
You haven't?

494
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,750
No strangers.
One of my favorite books.

495
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:42,320
I love them.
Yeah,

496
00:24:42,321 --> 00:24:42,830
you'd love him.

497
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:47,980
But here's the thing.
You just did it yesterday or was it the 

498
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:47,980
day before?
I can't remember.

499
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:49,190
That's the first line.
Yeah.

500
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,000
Wow.
Yeah,

501
00:24:50,001 --> 00:24:55,001
it's really good.
But he liked that thing that you're 

502
00:24:55,001 --> 00:24:55,001
talking about that at aching fucking 
thing.

503
00:24:55,001 --> 00:24:59,860
His premise c,
a m u s his premise in a lot of,

504
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:02,570
uh,
of his ilk,

505
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,950
their premise is that,
that,

506
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:07,880
that is being human,
like that awful feeling of like having a

507
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:11,900
whole that you are constantly trying to.
That's the name of his book.

508
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:16,370
The Myth of sisyphus.
The stranger illustrated is a novel.

509
00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:21,570
Let's try the myth of sisyphus.
If you want to get into the philosophy 

510
00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:21,820
Anglo,
but uh,

511
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,900
it's pretty,
it's pretty cool stuff,

512
00:25:23,901 --> 00:25:28,901
but it will give you that chilling kind.
Sufis s y s is there another wine there?

513
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:35,170
Assistant s y s y p e h u s fuss as if 
it's beautiful.

514
00:25:35,361 --> 00:25:37,100
I don't really need to totally know 
that.

515
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:42,440
Google next to be on the kindle crack 
crack.

516
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,050
This specificity was cursed.
It's a Greek myth,

517
00:25:48,051 --> 00:25:53,051
was cursed by the gods to eternally push
a boulder up to the very top of a hill 

518
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,970
and then to let it roll back down the 
hill.

519
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:58,570
And when it gets to the top of that 
story,

520
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:02,180
is that like the Colonel Turner?
So the,

521
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:07,210
so like the excess,
some existentialists look at the human 

522
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:08,900
predicament and they point out the fact 
that you're going to die.

523
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:11,540
No one will remember you in a few 
hundred years.

524
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:16,720
All,
most human achievements that have 

525
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:16,720
happened in the past are completely 
lost,

526
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,480
gone,
forgotten.

527
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:22,600
Even though they're in history,
it's still ultimately a meaningless 

528
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:25,691
thing in a sense that you have this 
inevitable personal extinction that's 

529
00:26:25,691 --> 00:26:26,020
going to happen.
Uh,

530
00:26:26,021 --> 00:26:30,650
and so the predicament and life is one 
of being sisyphus.

531
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:32,450
Here we are.
Anything we do,

532
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:33,590
push it up the fucking hell.

533
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:35,660
It's gonna like roll back down.
We got to start over,

534
00:26:35,661 --> 00:26:37,310
push it up the hill,
roll back down.

535
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:41,630
This is the kind of human archetype for 
how do we,

536
00:26:41,631 --> 00:26:46,080
in the midst of what appears to be 
meaninglessness and the infinite scale,

537
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:50,250
find meaning in an in like human 
endeavors.

538
00:26:50,251 --> 00:26:53,610
When the whole thing's going to get 
wiped out by the star,

539
00:26:53,670 --> 00:26:58,670
the sun.
Some of those philosophies have brought 

540
00:26:58,670 --> 00:26:58,670
them to God.
What's that?

541
00:26:58,670 --> 00:27:02,390
Some of those existentialist that 
brought them to God because there were 

542
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:02,390
like,
this must be the answer.

543
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:03,180
The access.
There are weirdly,

544
00:27:03,181 --> 00:27:06,390
there are theological or theistic 
existentialists,

545
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:08,820
Soren Kierkegaard.
There's some of them are,

546
00:27:08,821 --> 00:27:12,620
and you believe in God.
We're start.

547
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:14,610
Yeah.
Then they're the ones who are just like,

548
00:27:14,611 --> 00:27:17,430
no,
it's just all nausea and confusion.

549
00:27:17,431 --> 00:27:19,390
My friends,
it's just a lot.

550
00:27:19,410 --> 00:27:22,170
I don't buy that because I don't buy 
them knowing.

551
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:25,380
I don't know anyone that says no.
It's nothing.

552
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:27,060
Nope.
There's nothing like,

553
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:28,080
how do you know?
There's nothing.

554
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:30,900
You have no idea where.
There's no examples.

555
00:27:30,901 --> 00:27:32,720
There's no price for something.
You're right.

556
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:34,020
Don't even bring it up,
right?

557
00:27:34,021 --> 00:27:36,020
You don't bring it up,
but you don't say no,

558
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:39,090
but you don't.
You don't say it's not something either,

559
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:41,710
but are you land more in that camp,
don't you?

560
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:44,790
It's not even part of the conversation.
Get out of here with that shit.

561
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:49,880
What is what a fish were once there?
Well,

562
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:55,790
if you look at the fossil record,
is there any reason to think that 

563
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:56,160
otherwise,
what are you talking about?

564
00:27:56,220 --> 00:28:01,220
I think there is.
I think there's reason to think that 

565
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:02,040
Fisher bears or whatever the fuck you 
want to think if it gets you in the zone

566
00:28:03,370 --> 00:28:08,370
because there's like a.
that's like taking two dribbles worth a 

567
00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:08,370
shot.

568
00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:09,190
Like it's just like ritual,
ritual.

569
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,640
It makes you feel better.
That's fun thing you just described.

570
00:28:11,641 --> 00:28:15,930
The two dribbles before the foul shot 
that the that's called chaos magic.

571
00:28:15,931 --> 00:28:20,931
That's the roots of a magical system 
that just that it's based on the idea 

572
00:28:20,931 --> 00:28:25,281
that these symbols themselves,
they lack any inherent meaning outside 

573
00:28:25,281 --> 00:28:29,511
of the mind state that they place you in
and so if they help you transform your 

574
00:28:30,511 --> 00:28:35,160
will into reality,
so if that ritual helps you score,

575
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:39,690
if whatever the fucking thing is that 
you do prior to sitting down to write or

576
00:28:39,691 --> 00:28:42,390
prior to whatever it is that your job 
happens to be,

577
00:28:42,391 --> 00:28:47,391
if that actually puts your mind in a 
state where you are more likely to 

578
00:28:47,431 --> 00:28:52,431
receive inspiration or you're going to 
be more graceful or athletic and that's 

579
00:28:53,731 --> 00:28:55,470
all that fucking matters.
Who Cares?

580
00:28:56,390 --> 00:28:57,450
Yeah.
That's all that matters.

581
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:58,950
Who the symbols themselves,
do you.

582
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:03,950
I mean,
are you really going to like worry over 

583
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:05,850
the actual existence of a elephant 
headed god?

584
00:29:05,851 --> 00:29:10,851
That right?
It can shrink down and ride around 

585
00:29:10,851 --> 00:29:10,980
family unit over at Rosewell and it's 
like,

586
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:16,040
oh,
they've fallen out of the issue is a 

587
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:18,141
belief system as much as the issue is 
getting caught up in an ideology that 

588
00:29:18,141 --> 00:29:20,790
you can't question.
That's because when you do that,

589
00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:25,850
if you want to go into thor camp or 
whatever camp you want to go to and you 

590
00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:27,690
believe is the,
you know the grand ruler of the fucking.

591
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:30,420
Yeah,
no matter who it is.

592
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:31,710
In the name of God,
Odin,

593
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:32,540
Odin,
renter,

594
00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:33,410
praise,
Odin.

595
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:34,680
Praise Odin.
Yes.

596
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:39,000
Anytime you can't question anything,
you're fucks bill.

597
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,250
If you have something you believe

598
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:47,010
that's probably empowering.
It's not empowering is when you 

599
00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:50,371
subscribe to an ideology because if you 
believe that there's some all eternal 

600
00:29:50,371 --> 00:29:54,750
loving God that's looking over you and 
judging you everyday and that you have 

601
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:57,340
to do your best to make him proud.
That is your divine father.

602
00:29:57,550 --> 00:30:00,400
He created you and you know,
deepen your DNA.

603
00:30:00,401 --> 00:30:04,780
What the good things you're supposed to 
do is if that if you really go live your

604
00:30:04,781 --> 00:30:09,781
life like that,
you'll probably live a pretty fucking 

605
00:30:09,781 --> 00:30:09,781
cool life.
Yup.

606
00:30:09,781 --> 00:30:09,790
You'll be really nice to people.
You'd be super righteous.

607
00:30:09,791 --> 00:30:12,490
You would want to make your daddy God 
all proud of you and shit.

608
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:16,300
The problem is when you subscribe to an 
ideology,

609
00:30:16,301 --> 00:30:18,760
and that doesn't let you question 
anything,

610
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:23,940
the problem is not believing in a god.
The problem is now what do you have to 

611
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:23,940
do?
Because you believe that God,

612
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:25,930
well,
now you have to stop gay marriage.

613
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:31,080
You have to stop masturbating.
You have to stop people from doing this 

614
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:31,340
and stop.
Yeah,

615
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:36,390
you gotta.
You have to listen to me because my way 

616
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:36,940
is the right way and the Lord is the 
true Islam is the truth.

617
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:39,220
All of that stuff.
It's all the same shit.

618
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:41,130
It's all the same shit.
The ideologies,

619
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:43,030
the problem.
It's not the believing in God.

620
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:45,100
What does this motherfucker God want you
to go?

621
00:30:45,101 --> 00:30:49,390
Do you want me to strap dynamite to your
chest and walk into a cafe,

622
00:30:49,870 --> 00:30:52,270
but God gets associated just like you're
talking about the chicken lady.

623
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:54,370
God gets associated with that,
so you want to be like,

624
00:30:54,371 --> 00:30:59,371
no,
fuck them and fuck the thing that they 

625
00:30:59,371 --> 00:30:59,371
believe in.
Exactly.

626
00:30:59,371 --> 00:30:59,371
Well,
yeah,

627
00:30:59,371 --> 00:31:02,881
it's like a guy that.
What happens is there's violent people 

628
00:31:02,881 --> 00:31:03,220
in the world and they like to be 
violent.

629
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:05,410
They enjoy it.
It gets them off,

630
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:10,440
but they can't rationalize the fact that
they enjoy being violent because it's 

631
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:13,540
seems so monstrous and animalistic need.
You need a reason.

632
00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:18,870
See,
their religion is a fantastic way to 

633
00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:20,790
justify every dark activity that humans 
engage with.

634
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:22,660
Yes.
You can fucking like.

635
00:31:22,661 --> 00:31:24,490
Did you see the thing that popped up on 
the Internet?

636
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:27,100
Isis is guide to having child sex 
slaves.

637
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:32,400
Did you see that?
Like I have a guidebook which is like 

638
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:32,400
they have questions like there's 
important questions.

639
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:36,820
If you have a slave that's under aged,
that's a girl and you're wanting,

640
00:31:36,821 --> 00:31:37,920
or a,
I guess a guy,

641
00:31:37,921 --> 00:31:38,100
I don't know.

642
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:43,110
I guess they don't like gay people.
So if you have an underage sex slave 

643
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:45,370
that's a girl and you are an isis,
you're going to have some questions.

644
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:48,910
The number one being,
when do I get to fuck her?

645
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:53,940
Yeah.
And this is a guidebook where they're 

646
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:53,940
like,
well,

647
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:53,940
can you fucker.
Well,

648
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:55,860
if she's able to have sex in this 
guidebook,

649
00:31:56,150 --> 00:31:58,470
it's as if she's able to have sex.
Uh,

650
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:00,190
yeah.
But if she's not,

651
00:32:00,191 --> 00:32:03,970
then you can enjoy her in other ways,
like just don't penetrate her.

652
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:05,320
But that's a real thing,
man.

653
00:32:05,321 --> 00:32:06,310
They put,
they're putting that in there

654
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:11,330
quoting,
how do we know this is real and how do 

655
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:11,330
we CIA plant?
We

656
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:15,710
don't know that it could be an.
I did think that this could be 

657
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:15,750
propaganda.
I thought that this could be propaganda,

658
00:32:16,170 --> 00:32:21,170
but they do.
There are taking slaves like it is a 

659
00:32:21,170 --> 00:32:23,481
thing that they are taking slaves and 
some of those slaves are women and if 

660
00:32:23,481 --> 00:32:24,420
you have a female slave that you've 
taken,

661
00:32:24,421 --> 00:32:29,421
that you've captured from your enemy,
then you are going to have some 

662
00:32:29,421 --> 00:32:30,420
questions about the role.
Like as a religious person.

663
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:31,680
Definitely.
Absolutely.

664
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:32,980
Yeah.
What are you going to do with your.

665
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:38,270
How do you ethically fuck this girl?
Like when like when the dishwasher was 

666
00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:39,200
invented,
Jews had to go to the rabbis and said we

667
00:32:39,201 --> 00:32:42,050
allowed to put milk and meat dishes in 
here.

668
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:44,190
What's the ruling here?
That shit,

669
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:46,190
that kind of logic.
They use that based on,

670
00:32:46,370 --> 00:32:46,830
in a second.

671
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:47,520
Are you,
uh,

672
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:50,700
what is the answer to that?
A lot of Jews have separate dishwashers.

673
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:51,660
Dad,
Syria,

674
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:54,840
lariat conflation.
Oh my goodness.

675
00:32:54,841 --> 00:32:56,370
If you want to be kosher.
Yeah.

676
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:58,260
The main thing is the main thing is 
this,

677
00:32:58,580 --> 00:32:59,440
right?
What the.

678
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:04,480
I mean it's awful.
It's like the sex slavery isn't as 

679
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:04,500
ridiculous as that as the structure is 
always the same,

680
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:07,830
which is a very manipulative,
charismatic power,

681
00:33:07,831 --> 00:33:12,831
hungry narcicisstic guy has convinced 
some dumb people that he has got the 

682
00:33:12,871 --> 00:33:17,871
line end God and as long as they're 
coming to him to ask him what to do,

683
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:20,700
it's great.
That's the main structure.

684
00:33:20,701 --> 00:33:25,701
The structure needs to be that have 
certain amount of people believe that 

685
00:33:25,701 --> 00:33:29,151
there is one person who has contact with
an invisible guy and that that that 

686
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:32,010
person will tell them what's right and 
what's wrong.

687
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:34,620
It's very comforting.
We don't have to worry about it.

688
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:39,710
You don't have to worry about it.
Just go to the guy and ask him like you 

689
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:40,950
can feed her moral quantitative figure.
Yeah,

690
00:33:41,050 --> 00:33:45,440
but it's so dark,
but really when you see what's what,

691
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:50,470
what's happening,
there is this incredibly awful version 

692
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:54,831
of snm it sadomasochism you're going to 
your daddy to find out how the fuck.

693
00:33:55,530 --> 00:33:58,320
It's like this dark say to mass.
That's what it is.

694
00:33:58,321 --> 00:34:03,321
It's snm.
You're going to your daddy to find out 

695
00:34:03,321 --> 00:34:04,680
if you can put milk with whatever in 
your in your washing machine,

696
00:34:04,681 --> 00:34:07,260
you're going to daddy to find out if you
can use birth control.

697
00:34:07,261 --> 00:34:09,720
It's always set.
A lot of times it's sex related.

698
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:14,960
Like the pope just said something like,
didn't you just come out and say like 

699
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,170
you don't have to.
He was talking about how to have sex.

700
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:21,560
You know,
they'll tell you you can't use birth 

701
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:21,560
control.
You know that.

702
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:24,650
They tell you things involving sex,
like a man who is connected to an 

703
00:34:24,650 --> 00:34:27,990
invisible being will tell you how to 
fuck on this planet.

704
00:34:33,130 --> 00:34:37,230
What I mean it is stupid.
It is as dumb as it gets,

705
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:39,120
but when you consider the fact that it 
is,

706
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:44,300
not only is it real,
but it is like these people doing this 

707
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:48,261
are behind businesses that are making 
billions of dollars every year and that 

708
00:34:48,961 --> 00:34:53,961
money is going in the direction of 
paying for lobbyists to control 

709
00:34:53,961 --> 00:34:57,291
government and politics.
That's when it becomes minister 

710
00:34:57,291 --> 00:34:57,291
government.
Sinister.

711
00:34:57,291 --> 00:34:59,800
If you look at it from a picture 
perspective,

712
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:04,890
do you think it's possible for people to
have gotten where we've gotten as 

713
00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:06,340
quickly as we've gotten without 
religion,

714
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:11,370
without some organizing ethical behavior
was the big jump early on now?

715
00:35:11,811 --> 00:35:13,960
What's holding us back?
We're back then it was really helping us

716
00:35:13,961 --> 00:35:15,220
like guys,
guys don't kill.

717
00:35:15,370 --> 00:35:17,710
Well,
we would be raping and pillaging.

718
00:35:17,711 --> 00:35:22,711
Still.
There's a Judeo Christian way of living 

719
00:35:22,711 --> 00:35:25,741
they say,
which is just like the basic tenants 

720
00:35:25,741 --> 00:35:25,741
like don't murder,
don't steal,

721
00:35:25,741 --> 00:35:25,741
don't,
don't,

722
00:35:25,741 --> 00:35:25,741
don't rape.
Well,

723
00:35:25,741 --> 00:35:30,451
it's almost like an idea virus that is 
introduced into a system in order to 

724
00:35:30,641 --> 00:35:35,641
force growth in a certain direction 
because I never would have gotten 

725
00:35:35,641 --> 00:35:36,460
society without a doubt it.
I doubt it.

726
00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:39,630
Dudes want to fuck the Greeks.
People want to rape.

727
00:35:40,010 --> 00:35:42,240
Yeah,
but they had a gang of different gods,

728
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,520
but I think they were kind of like Greek
gods.

729
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:47,010
I think even back then they were.
I think even back then.

730
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:48,780
I don't know for sure.
You know what?

731
00:35:48,810 --> 00:35:53,810
I'm not even going to that part of me 
that likes to chime in as though I know 

732
00:35:53,810 --> 00:35:56,160
anything about Greek gods to come in,
have no idea.

733
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:57,900
I have no idea.
I don't know.

734
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:02,130
I'm not really sure about that man,
but I do think that it's a.

735
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:06,420
The predicament that regardless of that 
being,

736
00:36:06,421 --> 00:36:11,421
whether that was a kind of cast that 
needed to be placed on humanity as a 

737
00:36:11,431 --> 00:36:15,570
whole to allow this growth or this thing
to do.

738
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:21,140
Now we're in a place where we've 
outgrown the cast time to take off the 

739
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:22,290
cast.
It's starting to smell like a.

740
00:36:22,370 --> 00:36:26,040
like somebody sneezed into erotic 
vagina.

741
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:28,740
Well,
it's being replaced with a new one.

742
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:33,270
It's being replaced with atheism.
Atheism is very much a religion,

743
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:35,240
but we take those tenants of like,
yeah,

744
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:36,230
we got killed.

745
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,340
We lost that one.
I don't mean it in a negative way.

746
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:41,400
I mean it's like religion is the wrong 
word.

747
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:44,790
It's an organized group.
The people that are a part of it,

748
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:49,880
they.
They subscribed to the ideology of this 

749
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:53,181
organized group and or almost like for a
large percentage at least,

750
00:36:53,551 --> 00:36:57,420
I shouldn't say almost the majority,
but a large percentage or liberal,

751
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,520
a large percentage of atheists are 
liberal people.

752
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:08,300
They tend to lean left with their ideas.
I would say if you had to gauge the 

753
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:10,080
difference between the Republican side 
and there were Democrats are like,

754
00:37:10,081 --> 00:37:13,530
which one has more atheist?
It would clearly be Democrat.

755
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:14,640
Right?
Is that right?

756
00:37:14,641 --> 00:37:16,170
Am I guessing?
I'm just guessing.

757
00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:18,450
I don't know.
Let's see if we're right.

758
00:37:18,451 --> 00:37:19,730
I'm sure that's been done.
That's.

759
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:22,230
Yeah,
that seems pretty logical to think that.

760
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,840
You mean it does seem logical,
but let's see if it's true.

761
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:30,590
Also the more into their super into God.
The Republicans might have some 

762
00:37:30,590 --> 00:37:31,540
atheists,
but the ones that are super undergone,

763
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:34,440
those are more Republicans.
I don't really know.

764
00:37:34,770 --> 00:37:37,500
Could you be a single president?
Is that even country?

765
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,540
Nope.
The candidates of the president.

766
00:37:39,541 --> 00:37:40,140
You can't be like.
No,

767
00:37:40,141 --> 00:37:42,530
if you haven't figured that out.
I hardly think.

768
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:47,540
I was wondering what would happen like 
if Obama as a president allowed to have 

769
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:50,040
another job like in Obama start like 
working on comedy.

770
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:53,700
Could he do stand up if he wanted to at 
night?

771
00:37:53,701 --> 00:37:57,660
If he wasn't working at better could.
That would be amazing.

772
00:37:57,690 --> 00:37:59,730
I've done my job.
It's 6:30

773
00:37:59,730 --> 00:38:01,050
PM.
I worked an extra hour.

774
00:38:01,051 --> 00:38:06,051
I'm clocked out president.
A lot of the people in Congress are 

775
00:38:06,121 --> 00:38:09,810
closeted that are atheist closet.
That's hilarious.

776
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:14,840
Wow.
What a bunch of fucking fakers it's 

777
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:15,720
saying there's an article about this on 
a progress.

778
00:38:15,870 --> 00:38:20,100
Why all of the atheists in Congress are 
are closeted.

779
00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:25,790
That's.
We'll say it had to pretend like you 

780
00:38:25,790 --> 00:38:25,790
can't.
It's not popular.

781
00:38:25,790 --> 00:38:29,240
Atheism is not unpopular.
There's a certain thing that people want

782
00:38:29,241 --> 00:38:30,990
to do.
They want to say something really stupid

783
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:34,590
and have everybody else go you like,
we're not going to think anymore than we

784
00:38:34,591 --> 00:38:36,340
already.
Yeah.

785
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:37,600
When people say,
well,

786
00:38:37,601 --> 00:38:42,601
I'll tell you what,
I meet somebody and they're an atheist 

787
00:38:42,601 --> 00:38:45,550
walk way because they're a damn fool.
Who said a Steve Harvey.

788
00:38:45,610 --> 00:38:50,610
That's right.
I did it in a white boy damn food and it

789
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:58,890
gets silly.
Silly,

790
00:38:59,050 --> 00:38:59,500
silly,

791
00:39:02,130 --> 00:39:04,760
that's an argument,
PJ Harvey or whatever it was,

792
00:39:05,330 --> 00:39:07,950
kind of moral compass.
Do you operate on them?

793
00:39:08,010 --> 00:39:13,010
That's the idea.
I can't trust you if you don't believe 

794
00:39:13,010 --> 00:39:15,681
and assemble.
That was created a long time ago by 

795
00:39:15,681 --> 00:39:18,360
people trying to control other people.
This is like silly,

796
00:39:18,361 --> 00:39:21,420
so forget it.
There's a book I read in God dammit.

797
00:39:21,421 --> 00:39:26,421
I wish I could remember the name of it,
but the very first chapter in the book 

798
00:39:26,421 --> 00:39:29,391
was talking about how fascinating it is 
that in the old testament when God is 

799
00:39:31,201 --> 00:39:33,240
asking for offerings,
yeah,

800
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:38,950
killed only want stuff that humans like.
Like he only wants the best thing.

801
00:39:38,971 --> 00:39:43,971
Like God never tells priests to ask 
people for like a jar of wasps.

802
00:39:45,290 --> 00:39:48,510
It's only,
it's only like goats.

803
00:39:48,930 --> 00:39:53,930
Like now the same system worked.
Then the priest would come out and be 

804
00:39:53,930 --> 00:39:54,360
like,
God wants.

805
00:39:54,361 --> 00:39:55,620
They do money.
That's what they do.

806
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:58,280
The fucking people,
Jimmy or whatever his name is.

807
00:39:58,580 --> 00:39:59,150
Yeah.
Yeah,

808
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:04,160
but it's.
The difference is money now it's this 

809
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,901
ambiguous thing,
but back then what was kind of 

810
00:40:05,901 --> 00:40:07,581
interesting is like you would actually 
ask for like the fatted calf or you'd 

811
00:40:07,681 --> 00:40:12,681
ask her stuff was only stuff pad.
God wants a new ipad.

812
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,210
Technology.
Yeah.

813
00:40:15,211 --> 00:40:17,700
God wants a.
don't let your computers.

814
00:40:17,730 --> 00:40:18,510
Yeah,
it's very.

815
00:40:18,570 --> 00:40:20,970
It's fascinating that way.
But I still.

816
00:40:20,971 --> 00:40:22,620
I mean I do like.
I don't know.

817
00:40:22,650 --> 00:40:24,540
I don't know.
I think God's an overused word,

818
00:40:24,541 --> 00:40:27,000
but I do think there is definitely like 
I don't know what God wants.

819
00:40:27,001 --> 00:40:28,620
He didn't really tell us officially.
How about,

820
00:40:28,830 --> 00:40:30,000
how about we just give him some of this 
shit.

821
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:31,440
It's our favorite shit.
Yeah.

822
00:40:31,441 --> 00:40:33,420
Just get on the ice,
man.

823
00:40:33,421 --> 00:40:38,421
That's really fascinating stuff.
I've been reading this book that I know 

824
00:40:38,421 --> 00:40:39,300
it's a controversial book and some 
people say that it's like,

825
00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:40,080
I don't know.

826
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,490
I liked the book.
It's well written.

827
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:46,760
It's called a zealot by Reza as la land.
It's the historical Christ and his 

828
00:40:48,091 --> 00:40:53,091
premise is that Jesus,
the regardless of its premise,

829
00:40:53,461 --> 00:40:58,461
what's really fascinating is he just 
talking about what it was like back 

830
00:40:58,461 --> 00:40:59,000
then,
which is that the Romans had,

831
00:40:59,010 --> 00:41:01,290
were occupying,
um,

832
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:02,520
that,
that,

833
00:41:02,521 --> 00:41:07,521
that land and that the priests were 
actually people who were used to be used

834
00:41:08,161 --> 00:41:13,161
to be like a religious thing,
but they were by their positions from 

835
00:41:13,161 --> 00:41:14,130
the Romans.
So everybody wanted the Romans gone.

836
00:41:14,310 --> 00:41:15,270
And so.
Oh,

837
00:41:15,271 --> 00:41:16,280
right.
So like,

838
00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:18,480
you know,
in the story in the Bible,

839
00:41:18,481 --> 00:41:23,481
Jesus is crucified between two thieves.
And so Reza Aslan says that if you look 

840
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:28,221
at the actual word for thief,
it actually translates into bandit and 

841
00:41:28,681 --> 00:41:33,681
bandit is the word that the Romans used 
to describe people who are trying to 

842
00:41:33,681 --> 00:41:35,030
overthrow them.
So Jesus,

843
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:40,280
his premises was somebody who was pro 
violence and wanted to overthrow the 

844
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:40,850
Romans.

845
00:41:40,850 --> 00:41:43,010
And there were a lot of other people I 
came to.

846
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:48,200
And so when people were saying they were
like the son of God or the Messiah,

847
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:52,910
the Term Messiah actually meant like the
King of the Jews.

848
00:41:52,911 --> 00:41:56,120
Somebody who is going to like lead the 
liberate the Jews from the Romans.

849
00:41:56,330 --> 00:41:59,060
It's a really great book.
In the very first chapter,

850
00:41:59,061 --> 00:42:00,860
title,
it'd be a cool fucking movie.

851
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:06,040
It would be really cool,
but the version of when they talk about 

852
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:06,850
the the same,
well they weren't.

853
00:42:06,970 --> 00:42:11,970
No,
I mean a lot of like what he says is 

854
00:42:11,970 --> 00:42:11,970
like if you read in the,
in,

855
00:42:11,970 --> 00:42:15,190
in the,
in the Bible now they haven't scrubbed 

856
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:17,741
all of the violence.
Debbie said one thing he said is like 

857
00:42:17,741 --> 00:42:18,190
something about I will turn you away.
I will turn,

858
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:21,980
turn father against son.
I will turn like,

859
00:42:21,981 --> 00:42:26,780
if you aren't able to leave your family 
then you'll never be able to follow me.

860
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:31,780
It's like all these things which are 
crazy to liberty is fucking Romans Outta

861
00:42:32,211 --> 00:42:32,800
here,
man.

862
00:42:32,810 --> 00:42:37,810
That was the idea.
These assholes are occupying our 

863
00:42:37,810 --> 00:42:37,810
country.
They've taken over our religion.

864
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:42,940
We're going to fucking overthrow them.
And they really couldn't understand why 

865
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:44,690
God let the Romans in there in the first
place.

866
00:42:44,691 --> 00:42:49,100
So that was a real monkey wrench in 
their ideas were the chosen people.

867
00:42:49,101 --> 00:42:49,760
But it's like,
no,

868
00:42:49,761 --> 00:42:54,761
you're not really that fucking chosen 
people because they're guys who are 

869
00:42:54,761 --> 00:42:57,240
guarding your temples now wearing Roman 
outfits.

870
00:42:57,241 --> 00:43:02,241
And mine's got freedom from slavery that
we're sorta half slaves again quickly 

871
00:43:02,241 --> 00:43:03,140
and they couldn't tie.
Didn't work,

872
00:43:03,141 --> 00:43:08,141
man.
It was like the to the paradigm did not 

873
00:43:08,141 --> 00:43:08,420
fit in with their idea that we're the 
chosen people.

874
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:11,240
Suddenly there's these fucking Romans 
occupying everything.

875
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:16,420
And so a lot of the,
these messiahs and there are many 

876
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:16,700
besides before Jesus,
by the way,

877
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:20,120
John the Baptist executed.
Why was he executed?

878
00:43:20,121 --> 00:43:25,121
He was executed because they looked at 
him as a threat to the Roman power 

879
00:43:25,121 --> 00:43:25,121
structure.
That was it.

880
00:43:25,121 --> 00:43:27,200
All these people getting crucified.
And by the way,

881
00:43:27,201 --> 00:43:29,120
man,
crucifixion was in back then,

882
00:43:29,121 --> 00:43:32,180
like they were throwing people on 
crosses every day.

883
00:43:32,181 --> 00:43:37,181
So it was like,
it was like a constant attempt to like 

884
00:43:37,181 --> 00:43:38,080
take down a rebellion.
That's it.

885
00:43:38,090 --> 00:43:39,620
Silence the rebellion.
Yeah.

886
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:41,360
Yeah.
I silenced the rebellion.

887
00:43:41,390 --> 00:43:42,550
It's really interesting.
Great Book.

888
00:43:42,630 --> 00:43:47,630
It's really crazy.
But those sort of volatile moments in 

889
00:43:47,630 --> 00:43:51,021
history,
crazed insane violent moments of control

890
00:43:51,181 --> 00:43:54,060
and then the repercussions of that 
control,

891
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:59,280
those are like the engines that fuel 
change and oftentimes fuel innovation 

892
00:43:59,610 --> 00:44:01,160
and I know we'll look at them as being,
yeah,

893
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:06,200
we look at them as being as like 
horrible moments when they're happening 

894
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:07,680
because they are for everyone involved.
But like for the future,

895
00:44:07,910 --> 00:44:12,910
like the,
I think all these chaotic moments where 

896
00:44:12,910 --> 00:44:15,651
these people struggling to get into a 
position for power in the fact that 

897
00:44:15,651 --> 00:44:16,350
nobody could really hold it and it keeps
and people have their complaints and the

898
00:44:16,351 --> 00:44:18,480
people that are rising up,
they have the will of the people because

899
00:44:18,481 --> 00:44:20,690
the will of the people is we don't want 
any as fucking terror anymore.

900
00:44:20,950 --> 00:44:21,330
Yeah,
yeah,

901
00:44:21,370 --> 00:44:21,810
yeah.
All right,

902
00:44:21,811 --> 00:44:23,790
let's go get them.
And then they get in and they become the

903
00:44:23,791 --> 00:44:25,050
person that we're fighting against.

904
00:44:25,050 --> 00:44:28,680
Like this process repeats itself over 
and over again.

905
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,840
And it seems like objectively,
if you look at it,

906
00:44:30,841 --> 00:44:33,780
it's this process of cleansing or 
filtering,

907
00:44:33,781 --> 00:44:38,781
almost like water coming down from a 
glacier and going through all those 

908
00:44:38,781 --> 00:44:39,660
rocks until it becomes pure.
It's like,

909
00:44:39,661 --> 00:44:42,000
it's got to go through all these trials 
and tribulations.

910
00:44:42,001 --> 00:44:45,120
There's got to be all these fucking 
chaotic moments of horror.

911
00:44:45,121 --> 00:44:47,730
So we understand what har is.
We never repeat her.

912
00:44:47,910 --> 00:44:50,910
You got to have a holocaust,
understand where the sixties came from.

913
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:56,120
You've got to have these bad moments 
that sort of make you like long for and 

914
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:58,350
accomplish the great height.

915
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:03,740
This is why I,
I just had Alex Gray on my podcast and 

916
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:05,740
I'm not going to try to repeat what he 
said about the Jews,

917
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:08,220
the chosen people because they're 
creating psychedelics,

918
00:45:08,221 --> 00:45:11,970
but he did one of his premises because 
Hoffman was a Jew.

919
00:45:12,150 --> 00:45:17,150
But when will,
the idea is that we needed scientific 

920
00:45:17,150 --> 00:45:18,450
materialism,
atheism.

921
00:45:18,451 --> 00:45:23,451
We needed people to turn their backs on 
the ancient version of God so that we 

922
00:45:23,791 --> 00:45:28,791
can understand the universe at a deep 
enough level to be able to,

923
00:45:29,790 --> 00:45:32,240
uh,
create the,

924
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:36,990
to synthesize lsd and all the various 
smart to figure that shit out.

925
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:37,990
Yeah,
it's really cool.

926
00:45:37,991 --> 00:45:42,991
But it's kind of what you're saying,
which is like we needed like these 

927
00:45:42,991 --> 00:45:44,950
phases in human evolution are really 
important because like if,

928
00:45:44,990 --> 00:45:46,170
if you,
if you're constant,

929
00:45:46,171 --> 00:45:51,171
if you're caught up and are ridiculous 
version of the deity and then maybe 

930
00:45:51,171 --> 00:45:55,701
you're not going to be so inclined to 
study molecular biology or maybe you're 

931
00:45:55,701 --> 00:45:59,271
not gonna be able to study chemistry in 
the same way and without studying that 

932
00:45:59,271 --> 00:46:02,901
stuff,
then we wouldn't have some of the 

933
00:46:02,901 --> 00:46:06,021
psychoactive compounds that I think a 
lot of people consider as being one of 

934
00:46:07,141 --> 00:46:11,910
the potential ways that our species can 
evolve.

935
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:13,800
And so these,
these,

936
00:46:14,070 --> 00:46:19,070
these psychedelics can actually be ways 
to connect with the thing that the 

937
00:46:19,070 --> 00:46:23,721
ancient religions were talking about.
And then the thing that ended up being 

938
00:46:23,721 --> 00:46:26,490
like turning turned into like a painted 
clown,

939
00:46:26,730 --> 00:46:28,060
you know,
that people will.

940
00:46:28,170 --> 00:46:30,030
Somebody had a vision,
you know,

941
00:46:30,031 --> 00:46:32,650
Moses by that.
What was the burning Bush Bush,

942
00:46:32,730 --> 00:46:34,320
what was that?
What was it made of though?

943
00:46:34,330 --> 00:46:38,280
It was called a Acacia or something 
which has what in it?

944
00:46:38,310 --> 00:46:39,780
DMT.
Tryptamine.

945
00:46:39,781 --> 00:46:42,240
So the premise here is godliness

946
00:46:42,670 --> 00:46:43,510
fucking hurt.
Well,

947
00:46:43,511 --> 00:46:47,480
the idea of what is,
what would the story really big?

948
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:52,500
Well,
if you're translating something from 

949
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:52,500
ancient Hebrew and then you put into the
Latin and then eventually the English,

950
00:46:52,830 --> 00:46:54,810
what when you're doing that,
you're going to.

951
00:46:55,030 --> 00:46:58,180
The way they explain things is going to 
come off very different.

952
00:46:58,181 --> 00:47:01,540
Like if you ever read like Russian 
story's translated to English.

953
00:47:01,910 --> 00:47:03,240
There's.
It's so bizarre.

954
00:47:03,241 --> 00:47:05,530
Yeah.
Throw it through Google translate.

955
00:47:05,890 --> 00:47:08,080
It's so busy.
It's so hard to understand what is their

956
00:47:08,081 --> 00:47:13,081
language works so much differently.
So by saying that like God took the form

957
00:47:13,091 --> 00:47:18,091
of a burning Bush,
they easily could be saying he was 

958
00:47:18,091 --> 00:47:18,091
smoking dmt.
That's right.

959
00:47:18,091 --> 00:47:18,610
Easily.
Yeah,

960
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:23,720
and that's the fucking answer.
You dry the fucking that Bush out.

961
00:47:24,090 --> 00:47:26,230
Figure out a way to get the fucking dmt 
out of it.

962
00:47:26,231 --> 00:47:27,730
You smoke it.
Like if you.

963
00:47:27,731 --> 00:47:30,070
And especially if that's how they did.
Like what if they just lit

964
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:32,690
those bushes on fire and then just read 
it all in,

965
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:35,470
some out of it.
Just breathe in wholesale smoke.

966
00:47:35,890 --> 00:47:39,190
They did it like totally caveman style.
Just take those bushes,

967
00:47:39,191 --> 00:47:40,540
hack them down,
dry them out,

968
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:45,720
make a fucking a tent,
like one of those sweat lodges and let 

969
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:49,870
it fill up.
Hot herself with dmt and then he saw God

970
00:47:49,871 --> 00:47:50,500
was like,
dude,

971
00:47:51,070 --> 00:47:52,040
everybody down there.
Hold on.

972
00:47:52,650 --> 00:47:53,680
I got.
Oh my God,

973
00:47:53,681 --> 00:47:55,730
I got some stuff to tell you.
Oh my God.

974
00:47:57,010 --> 00:48:01,060
Because God was telling you that not to 
covet your neighbor's wife,

975
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:06,120
not because your neighbor's wife is like
his leaves my life while was alone.

976
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:09,510
The idea was that the guy owns that 
white.

977
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:10,180
Hey.
Yeah.

978
00:48:10,270 --> 00:48:14,530
That's crazy.
Like this insane archaic way of thinking

979
00:48:14,531 --> 00:48:16,480
that's connected to that time.
Yeah.

980
00:48:16,540 --> 00:48:20,380
So we don't even if Moses did say those 
things,

981
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:22,810
we have no idea what the actual words 
that came out.

982
00:48:22,930 --> 00:48:25,250
If Moses did have this psychedelic,
ancient,

983
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:28,300
he was not used anymore.
And not only that,

984
00:48:28,330 --> 00:48:31,660
like who the fuck wrote it down?
It wasn't Moses.

985
00:48:31,780 --> 00:48:34,630
Moses didn't write it down.
If I told you some shit that happened to

986
00:48:34,631 --> 00:48:39,631
me when I was a child and then you were.
It was your job to write a book after I 

987
00:48:39,631 --> 00:48:39,631
died.
Oh,

988
00:48:39,631 --> 00:48:41,200
you would butcher it.
I would put your,

989
00:48:41,210 --> 00:48:42,590
your life,
you would butcher Milo.

990
00:48:42,610 --> 00:48:47,610
We would butcher each other's lives if 
Moses wasn't writing it himself to 

991
00:48:47,610 --> 00:48:47,610
Moses.
Yeah.

992
00:48:47,610 --> 00:48:52,140
You know,
if you're not getting his fucking 

993
00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:53,791
notebook,
like who knows what was actually said 

994
00:48:53,791 --> 00:48:55,840
but jealous.
Written the same way throughout history.

995
00:48:55,841 --> 00:48:57,880
Like they write every letter the same 
exact way.

996
00:48:57,910 --> 00:49:01,330
That's the written tour world tour or 
something crazy looking,

997
00:49:01,331 --> 00:49:06,331
by the way is a language that's cool.
It's beautiful and it's so strange and 

998
00:49:06,331 --> 00:49:06,800
psychedelic.

999
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:10,450
They have to have a musical notes on 
each one of the letters.

1000
00:49:10,540 --> 00:49:15,540
You can really,
you know what to go up and say it while 

1001
00:49:18,060 --> 00:49:21,340
you're reading at the Toro road or 
partial.

1002
00:49:21,820 --> 00:49:23,830
Can you read Hebrew?
Of course.

1003
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:24,940
Fucking crazy,
man.

1004
00:49:24,941 --> 00:49:28,480
I'd like to learn it.
You lived in Israel,

1005
00:49:29,830 --> 00:49:31,870
religious studies.
Was it fun?

1006
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:32,410
Yeah,
I can.

1007
00:49:32,411 --> 00:49:34,420
I'm going to have.
It was just like a given for awhile,

1008
00:49:34,470 --> 00:49:36,040
but now that I look,
step back and look at it,

1009
00:49:36,041 --> 00:49:37,390
I was like,
that's pretty fucking cool.

1010
00:49:38,770 --> 00:49:39,880
Three weeks.
I thought it was cool.

1011
00:49:39,881 --> 00:49:43,000
I lived in Israel for two years.
Wow.

1012
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:44,590
How old were you?
18.

1013
00:49:44,620 --> 00:49:49,620
18 to 20.
So it was all that got drunk there for 

1014
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:49,620
the first time.
Pre,

1015
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:50,010
post,
pre pussy.

1016
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:52,390
Wow.
I haven't do anything back there.

1017
00:49:52,420 --> 00:49:54,360
Wow.
That's a fast.

1018
00:49:54,380 --> 00:49:57,400
So slowly take the buses and stuff.
What's it like there?

1019
00:49:57,460 --> 00:49:58,990
Everything's made of stone.
Jerusalem.

1020
00:49:59,290 --> 00:50:01,930
The whole city made up stuff.
The old all stone.

1021
00:50:02,170 --> 00:50:04,390
But everywhere else is like stone 
outside,

1022
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:07,000
you know the buildings.
It just looked really pretty.

1023
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:11,110
Did you go to that wall,
climbed up in that movie,

1024
00:50:12,850 --> 00:50:15,760
you know,
security cameras.

1025
00:50:16,150 --> 00:50:21,150
Why Monitor to the wall?
Separating from a mass of zombies 

1026
00:50:22,450 --> 00:50:25,930
dancing and having a great time and then
all of a sudden it's not fine.

1027
00:50:27,050 --> 00:50:32,050
Yeah.
He escaped to easily a lot in that 

1028
00:50:32,050 --> 00:50:34,511
movie.
Like plane crash and then only the two 

1029
00:50:34,511 --> 00:50:34,511
of you survive.

1030
00:50:36,250 --> 00:50:39,260
It's like Godzilla.
Same sort of situation.

1031
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:42,260
But.
So you were there from 18 to 20?

1032
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:44,700
Eighteen to 20.
I really got drunk for the first time.

1033
00:50:44,701 --> 00:50:45,770
I was like,
what years was that?

1034
00:50:46,250 --> 00:50:51,250
Well first I went.
My high school does it half year for 

1035
00:50:51,250 --> 00:50:51,740
senior year.
The second semester,

1036
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:55,250
second for six months we go to Israel 
and we all get tour groups.

1037
00:50:55,251 --> 00:50:56,750
That was the foods.
It's really two and a half years.

1038
00:50:56,780 --> 00:50:58,520
So one year and calendar year was this 
[inaudible]?

1039
00:50:58,670 --> 00:51:01,580
Ninety two,
I think.

1040
00:51:01,581 --> 00:51:04,310
January of [inaudible] 92.
So this is like Clinton presidency,

1041
00:51:04,340 --> 00:51:06,590
Bush.
I voted absentee ballot for Clinton.

1042
00:51:06,591 --> 00:51:08,180
That was the only time I ever go to the 
president.

1043
00:51:08,770 --> 00:51:11,830
Did you were religious garb while you 
were there?

1044
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:16,920
I mean Yamaka and the tassels man,
one thing we love doing because there 

1045
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:21,361
was no black people there,
only Ethiopians and they were like in 

1046
00:51:21,361 --> 00:51:21,361
like a different part of the town.

1047
00:51:21,361 --> 00:51:22,540
I'm of the country,
um,

1048
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:26,600
who just yelled nigger already each 
other down the street.

1049
00:51:26,930 --> 00:51:31,930
Oh no,
because it doesn't mean anything.

1050
00:51:35,301 --> 00:51:38,510
Doesn't mean anything to anybody.
That's fascinating.

1051
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:41,150
Scariest word.
Every.

1052
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:46,160
Yes.
You'd have to do like a full three 60 

1053
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:49,090
sweep of your surroundings with a 
helicopter parachute down and yell it to

1054
00:51:49,890 --> 00:51:54,890
feel super confident.
Someone was like the only word that you 

1055
00:51:54,890 --> 00:51:57,300
can yell out and the group is allowed to
punch you.

1056
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:03,260
If you yell at people.
Women can't just run up to you and punch

1057
00:52:03,261 --> 00:52:04,230
you,
you know,

1058
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:08,450
but if you didn't yell out Nigger,
they have a free pass.

1059
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:11,000
Just punch.
You want people to know this.

1060
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:15,920
The only racial slur that that is a free
pass to violence.

1061
00:52:16,150 --> 00:52:18,170
Yeah.
Chinese,

1062
00:52:18,290 --> 00:52:22,690
if you yell out change now look at you 
like you motherfucker,

1063
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:25,910
you piece of shit.
But there are certain dudes,

1064
00:52:25,911 --> 00:52:28,280
not all of them,
but there are certain dudes that if they

1065
00:52:28,281 --> 00:52:33,281
catch you yelling out that word,
they will fuck on Prophet Mohammed of 

1066
00:52:33,281 --> 00:52:33,281
words.

1067
00:52:37,290 --> 00:52:38,090
What?
It's crazy.

1068
00:52:38,091 --> 00:52:40,940
If you're in a place,
I mean there's guaranteed.

1069
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,400
There's people that just heard you say 
that,

1070
00:52:42,420 --> 00:52:43,800
that are going to be offended.
They're like,

1071
00:52:43,850 --> 00:52:44,910
you know,
fuck that guy.

1072
00:52:44,911 --> 00:52:47,360
You know who?
Fuck he think he is yelling at shit out.

1073
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:50,910
Dropping bombs podcast 22 years ago.
No,

1074
00:52:50,930 --> 00:52:55,930
it doesn't even matter.
Just the fact that you had just said it 

1075
00:52:55,930 --> 00:52:55,930
now,
right?

1076
00:52:55,930 --> 00:52:56,840
Just the fact that making fun,
that how irresponsible.

1077
00:52:56,841 --> 00:53:01,841
What's to say that you remember like the
bit about the three magic words and that

1078
00:53:02,031 --> 00:53:04,940
was one of them that like,
you can't even say it,

1079
00:53:05,060 --> 00:53:08,150
like you're not even allowed to say the 
word reference to if your weight.

1080
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:08,750
Yeah.

1081
00:53:09,190 --> 00:53:12,490
It is a really interesting thing because
symbols are harmless,

1082
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:17,940
but it somehow they justified violence.
Like whenever this ridiculous thing and 

1083
00:53:18,850 --> 00:53:21,800
image of the prophet,
the word round,

1084
00:53:21,910 --> 00:53:26,910
whenever it's there,
it's like that thing itself is 

1085
00:53:26,910 --> 00:53:26,910
meaningless.
Harmless.

1086
00:53:26,910 --> 00:53:31,430
But it allows,
it allows violent people an excuse to be

1087
00:53:32,551 --> 00:53:37,551
violent and there is nothing I think 
more satisfying than some people,

1088
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:39,230
uh,
to,

1089
00:53:39,250 --> 00:53:44,250
to,
to be violent and righteous at the same 

1090
00:53:44,250 --> 00:53:47,391
time.
Like American sniper that guys like 

1091
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:48,900
pegging like,
oh,

1092
00:53:48,901 --> 00:53:52,740
it's just some propaganda over from 
kills.

1093
00:53:52,741 --> 00:53:54,540
Not One role.
Even though every time it was like,

1094
00:53:54,810 --> 00:53:55,980
I don't know what that is,
is because man,

1095
00:53:56,070 --> 00:53:57,090
fuck it.
I'll tell you the shot.

1096
00:53:57,750 --> 00:53:58,930
Never got it wrong.
Oh,

1097
00:53:58,931 --> 00:54:00,990
awesome.
Oh Rah Rah movie.

1098
00:54:01,050 --> 00:54:01,800
Yeah,
it was,

1099
00:54:02,310 --> 00:54:05,160
it was really exciting.
Was horrible.

1100
00:54:05,370 --> 00:54:06,810
And you seen it?
No.

1101
00:54:08,220 --> 00:54:13,220
Howard stern was raving about it this 
fuck you old man was a horrible job.

1102
00:54:15,601 --> 00:54:17,580
There was no plot,
it was just some scenes.

1103
00:54:17,581 --> 00:54:20,610
The wife was only annoyed.
I haven't seen entire time.

1104
00:54:20,611 --> 00:54:22,570
She was just like,
are you going out there?

1105
00:54:22,571 --> 00:54:23,690
And again,
he'll give.

1106
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:24,870
Never built a relationship.

1107
00:54:24,870 --> 00:54:27,300
There's no fucking move.
You haven't written this fucking movie.

1108
00:54:29,260 --> 00:54:31,530
Don't give a fuck at the very edge they 
go,

1109
00:54:31,620 --> 00:54:33,360
they go that he,
okay.

1110
00:54:33,361 --> 00:54:35,490
So he comes home,
he's all fucked in the head.

1111
00:54:35,670 --> 00:54:36,830
He meets some,
uh,

1112
00:54:37,350 --> 00:54:38,010
some,
some,

1113
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:40,380
his wife,
he meets some veterans.

1114
00:54:40,381 --> 00:54:43,080
It helps them fucking sniper and that's 
how he gets his life together,

1115
00:54:43,110 --> 00:54:48,110
helps them sleep and shit.
And then he picks one guy up and he's 

1116
00:54:48,110 --> 00:54:48,110
like,
yeah,

1117
00:54:48,110 --> 00:54:48,110
we're going to go snipe today.
And then,

1118
00:54:48,110 --> 00:54:52,971
uh,
just at home on the range and the guy 

1119
00:54:52,971 --> 00:54:52,971
looks at his wife weird and then it cuts
away.

1120
00:54:52,971 --> 00:54:53,190
It goes,
uh,

1121
00:54:53,310 --> 00:54:56,030
he was killed by a veteran.
Oh,

1122
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:58,230
is that guy?
But they didn't even show what happened.

1123
00:54:58,231 --> 00:55:03,231
They didn't even show up to our 20 
minute movie show every tour fucking 

1124
00:55:03,231 --> 00:55:03,720
forward toward combine them,
but they won't show.

1125
00:55:03,780 --> 00:55:08,780
Forget that they failed to mentioned 
that your son or your daughter and they 

1126
00:55:08,780 --> 00:55:08,780
showed footage of the funeral 
procession.

1127
00:55:08,780 --> 00:55:13,220
Also.
The guys like Jesse Ventura sued that 

1128
00:55:13,220 --> 00:55:13,920
guy and one the guy who lied.
Yeah,

1129
00:55:13,921 --> 00:55:16,130
that's how ridiculous it was.
There was no.

1130
00:55:16,140 --> 00:55:17,450
It wasn't just dad.

1131
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:22,070
Apparently a whole long laundry list of 
questions.

1132
00:55:22,460 --> 00:55:25,230
That was that guy.
No wonder Carbon Jasper.

1133
00:55:25,231 --> 00:55:27,350
They probably didn't take out the plot 
like A.

1134
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:33,280
Well,
there was a bunch of other things that 

1135
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:33,280
he did that he said he did.
Like one of them was,

1136
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:35,620
there was a car jacking or two people 
shot and killed it.

1137
00:55:35,630 --> 00:55:37,940
Read like a fucking men talking about 
himself.

1138
00:55:38,030 --> 00:55:42,710
Apparently that's how I saw no evidence 
of the car jacking.

1139
00:55:42,711 --> 00:55:47,711
Took that guy to guy and there was 
another one where he killed a bunch of 

1140
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:52,421
people in Katrina.
He was a sniper and Katrina would shoot 

1141
00:55:52,421 --> 00:55:52,550
shooting looters and talked about,
which is like,

1142
00:55:52,940 --> 00:55:57,940
okay,
like it's one thing if you're shooting 

1143
00:55:57,940 --> 00:55:58,820
terrorists who have rocket launchers,
but you're shooting people that are poor

1144
00:55:58,821 --> 00:56:03,821
people that are stealing shit because 
they're involved in chaos because the 

1145
00:56:03,821 --> 00:56:07,400
fucking water has come and surrounded 
the city and there's no resources and so

1146
00:56:07,580 --> 00:56:12,580
you're shooting looters like it should 
be really fucking careful about who we 

1147
00:56:13,221 --> 00:56:16,100
celebrate.
If you're shooting looters,

1148
00:56:16,180 --> 00:56:17,030
yeah,
you're a murderer.

1149
00:56:17,090 --> 00:56:18,740
Yeah.
We're not talking about war.

1150
00:56:18,741 --> 00:56:23,741
We're not talking like even Michael 
Moore was talking about his pollutant 

1151
00:56:23,741 --> 00:56:23,900
though.
That's not what you get for Luda.

1152
00:56:23,901 --> 00:56:23,980
You

1153
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:26,390
don't get that from God.
Damn.

1154
00:56:26,700 --> 00:56:30,160
It's not made for people who want an 
agnostic for a judge to say,

1155
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:32,170
well,
it's not only that,

1156
00:56:32,171 --> 00:56:37,171
it's not the fucking roof.
It's going to be delivered because you 

1157
00:56:37,171 --> 00:56:39,070
go to a trial and you have a jury of 
your peers.

1158
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:44,080
That's what.
That's what the government is supposed 

1159
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:44,260
to be established for,
like to be on a rooftop.

1160
00:56:44,290 --> 00:56:46,970
Then you're just murdering.
This movie was like a full liar.

1161
00:56:47,740 --> 00:56:49,020
Crazy.
Well,

1162
00:56:49,030 --> 00:56:52,240
Jesse Ventura fucking navy seal.
He was in.

1163
00:56:52,241 --> 00:56:54,790
What's called the Udt before it was the 
navy seals,

1164
00:56:54,791 --> 00:56:56,500
I believe that's the name of the 
organization.

1165
00:56:56,501 --> 00:56:58,960
There was a predating name.
The same.

1166
00:56:58,990 --> 00:57:00,360
Jesse Ventura was one of them.
Yeah.

1167
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:05,520
So apparently this guy told the story 
about knocking out Jesse Ventura and 

1168
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:07,720
Jesse Ventura badmouthing the troops and
bad mouth no more,

1169
00:57:07,721 --> 00:57:10,060
which he said he would never do,
never did,

1170
00:57:10,270 --> 00:57:12,670
never argued with this guy that he never
got hit.

1171
00:57:12,850 --> 00:57:15,670
And he gave the guy an opportunity to,
uh,

1172
00:57:15,780 --> 00:57:20,780
to tracked it.
Otherwise he was [inaudible] he wrote 

1173
00:57:20,780 --> 00:57:21,280
about in his book he called them scruffy
face or something like that.

1174
00:57:21,460 --> 00:57:24,520
But then on radio shows he admitted that
it was Jesse Ventura,

1175
00:57:24,580 --> 00:57:26,980
so can do the math.
I think he did it on Opie and Anthony.

1176
00:57:26,981 --> 00:57:28,660
Actually,
I think that's where it came out.

1177
00:57:28,661 --> 00:57:32,500
So they realize that it's not true.
So the guy got killed.

1178
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:37,800
Okay.
Chris Kyle gets killed and now Jesse 

1179
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:38,770
Ventura goes through with the lawsuit 
with the guy's wife,

1180
00:57:39,490 --> 00:57:41,440
which that's.
See?

1181
00:57:41,470 --> 00:57:42,850
No,
she's got all the profits from the.

1182
00:57:42,910 --> 00:57:47,910
Yes,
fuck her off the fucking lie about him 

1183
00:57:47,910 --> 00:57:50,260
her.
Then she started saying,

1184
00:57:50,261 --> 00:57:52,060
I give that money to charity and then it
comes out later.

1185
00:57:52,061 --> 00:57:53,900
She's a liar too.
She kept 20 percent of it.

1186
00:57:55,210 --> 00:58:00,210
I think as long as her look,
if her why should life isn't.

1187
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:03,910
I mean it's,
he's suing the guy who lied.

1188
00:58:04,030 --> 00:58:06,190
It just so happened to the guy who lied,
died,

1189
00:58:06,780 --> 00:58:11,780
let's stop selling the book,
but that's the issue because you're 

1190
00:58:11,780 --> 00:58:11,780
dead,
right?

1191
00:58:11,780 --> 00:58:12,820
You're dead.
I'm going to the issue on the book.

1192
00:58:12,821 --> 00:58:15,880
Random guys like who owns the book?
Who put but.

1193
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:21,120
But then the issue is does he represent 
them when he goes on radio stations and 

1194
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:21,700
says something that's not even in the 
book.

1195
00:58:21,850 --> 00:58:23,650
Does he name the guy in the story in the
book,

1196
00:58:23,651 --> 00:58:28,651
but does that make them responsible?
I say it doesn't say it's not random 

1197
00:58:28,651 --> 00:58:29,980
house because he said scruffy face with 
a.

1198
00:58:30,390 --> 00:58:33,070
But then when he says,
now I've told you it was graffiti faces.

1199
00:58:33,071 --> 00:58:35,770
Now what you've printed label or 
whatever is the thing man,

1200
00:58:35,771 --> 00:58:40,771
if he wrote about all that other shit 
about shooting looters and all that 

1201
00:58:40,771 --> 00:58:40,780
other shit.
Like if that turns out to be not true,

1202
00:58:40,810 --> 00:58:43,510
which people are saying it's not true,
you really got to take the whole book.

1203
00:58:43,510 --> 00:58:48,510
Took the book off like this is what's 
important to separate had that book,

1204
00:58:48,701 --> 00:58:50,310
but the shattered a little pieces or 
whatever.

1205
00:58:50,311 --> 00:58:51,540
A thousand little pieces.
Yeah.

1206
00:58:51,541 --> 00:58:52,480
Yes.
He was like,

1207
00:58:52,481 --> 00:58:53,590
no,
it was all a lie and she was like,

1208
00:58:53,610 --> 00:58:54,220
what?
Because again,

1209
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:57,100
I'm a fucking kid.
He just said he went to heaven and he's.

1210
00:58:57,190 --> 00:58:58,990
He came out and said the whole thing was
a lie.

1211
00:58:59,260 --> 00:59:00,580
You know that?
Yeah.

1212
00:59:01,010 --> 00:59:03,160
They pulled that book too.
They went to heaven.

1213
00:59:03,490 --> 00:59:03,820
Well,
no,

1214
00:59:03,821 --> 00:59:07,390
there's this cheesy buck where a kid 
goes into a coma,

1215
00:59:07,700 --> 00:59:11,490
flies around having for awhile,
comes back right to this best seller.

1216
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:16,500
People are like,
I knew everyone was real and I knew it 

1217
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:16,500
was like this.
I never read it,

1218
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:17,910
but it's funny.
It's just the La area,

1219
00:59:18,190 --> 00:59:22,220
but the kid got religion actually got 
religion was and felt

1220
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:24,860
so guilty about wanting that.
He came out and said the whole thing was

1221
00:59:24,861 --> 00:59:26,420
alive,
that I could get attention.

1222
00:59:26,610 --> 00:59:27,800
It's not real great.

1223
00:59:27,910 --> 00:59:30,310
It's really,
it's the Nicole that there's a great,

1224
00:59:30,820 --> 00:59:35,820
there's a great blog that I read called 
a if you just google truth justice and 

1225
00:59:35,891 --> 00:59:38,420
the curious case of Chris Kyle.
It's really,

1226
00:59:38,590 --> 00:59:43,590
really well written.
I wrote which explains all of the 

1227
00:59:43,590 --> 00:59:48,180
various stories and here's why they 
couldn't be true and here he's not 

1228
00:59:48,180 --> 00:59:49,900
casting a judgment,
not using the inflammatory language.

1229
00:59:50,050 --> 00:59:55,050
Just trying to explain like what may be 
or may not have been true said in the 

1230
00:59:55,050 --> 00:59:55,780
beginning of this movie that was just 
released.

1231
00:59:55,810 --> 00:59:59,860
This is all a true story.
Some of it I'm sure was.

1232
01:00:00,040 --> 01:00:02,090
That's the thing,
the guy that the shoot some kid and they

1233
01:00:02,091 --> 01:00:03,340
go like,
if you're wrong about this,

1234
01:00:03,341 --> 01:00:08,341
you'll find that your spotter spotter is
telling you you're going to go to jail 

1235
01:00:08,341 --> 01:00:12,781
forever if you take this wrong shot.
Another thing you have to remember too 

1236
01:00:12,781 --> 01:00:13,630
is Clint Eastwood,
Clint Eastwood,

1237
01:00:13,631 --> 01:00:16,420
who used to be the baddest motherfucker 
and I'm done now.

1238
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:20,080
He's an old dude.
Talk to the chair.

1239
01:00:21,630 --> 01:00:23,410
Yeah.
You are dressed.

1240
01:00:23,411 --> 01:00:23,920
Obama.

1241
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:26,300
Yeah.
How do you direct a movie?

1242
01:00:26,390 --> 01:00:27,950
When I saw the thing?
No,

1243
01:00:27,980 --> 01:00:29,780
seriously,
when I saw the thing.

1244
01:00:29,930 --> 01:00:30,770
Oh,
I thought was,

1245
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:35,800
oh,
this is just clearly wartime propaganda 

1246
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:38,700
tweeted that he considered,
he compared it to the sniper movie and I

1247
01:00:38,701 --> 01:00:41,780
Tarantino's movie,
I think Rogan backpedaled a little bit,

1248
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:46,610
but in Tarantino's movie inglorious 
bastards there watching this in Germany,

1249
01:00:46,611 --> 01:00:51,611
they're watching a movie about a sniper 
and it's being celebrated propaganda.

1250
01:00:52,670 --> 01:00:55,790
It's propaganda.
American sniper is propaganda.

1251
01:00:55,791 --> 01:00:58,070
There's no question about it,
so we know that.

1252
01:00:58,280 --> 01:00:59,150
Then I was thinking like,
oh,

1253
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:04,200
let's make this shot of Clint Eastwood 
really direct this because when you see 

1254
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:04,250
him at the Republican National 
Convention,

1255
01:01:04,430 --> 01:01:08,360
he seemed kind of like out of it,
so then I was thinking,

1256
01:01:08,361 --> 01:01:13,361
how the fuck is this guy directing like 
this kind of hardcore action forum and 

1257
01:01:13,361 --> 01:01:16,700
the vase there because he's this manly,
rugged,

1258
01:01:16,701 --> 01:01:21,701
right wing Republican hero,
and they knew that that would like get 

1259
01:01:21,701 --> 01:01:25,181
more people to watch this movie,
which is essentially a lubricated water 

1260
01:01:25,181 --> 01:01:27,440
slide that leads to your nearest 
recruiting office.

1261
01:01:27,590 --> 01:01:29,600
If you get hypnotized by the thing 
enough,

1262
01:01:29,780 --> 01:01:30,670
that's what it is.
Oh,

1263
01:01:30,700 --> 01:01:35,700
you want to fight it?
You want to fight for justice and I'll 

1264
01:01:35,700 --> 01:01:35,700
tell you this now.
No,

1265
01:01:35,700 --> 01:01:35,700
you want to be noble.
You know what,

1266
01:01:35,700 --> 01:01:37,020
you don't want to work in the oil 
fields.

1267
01:01:37,060 --> 01:01:39,840
You want to be noble straight to seal.
It was 30.

1268
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:42,510
Think about a lot of people that are in 
this country that are.

1269
01:01:42,570 --> 01:01:47,570
You got boring as shit town with no 
fucking opportunity and you're 

1270
01:01:47,570 --> 01:01:51,260
surrounded by a bunch of dummies and 
then you go see this movie and you're 

1271
01:01:51,260 --> 01:01:51,260
like,
Holy Shit.

1272
01:01:51,260 --> 01:01:53,460
But I think when you make a movie about 
someone's life story,

1273
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:56,970
and this is what I was pissed off at Fox
catcher for the same reason,

1274
01:01:57,210 --> 01:02:02,210
that movie foxcatcher about a John 
Dupont who was that crazy old man who 

1275
01:02:02,210 --> 01:02:06,560
shot a Dave Schultz who's an Olympic 
champion wrestler and it was based on 

1276
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:10,941
his brother Mark Schultz in this one.
They fucked with everything in that 

1277
01:02:10,941 --> 01:02:10,941
movie.
They.

1278
01:02:10,941 --> 01:02:15,110
He's so angry.
He's been Mark Schultz have been 

1279
01:02:15,110 --> 01:02:15,110
tweeting like crazy because he's still 
alive.

1280
01:02:15,270 --> 01:02:17,410
He's an Olympic gold medalist.
I mean that.

1281
01:02:17,690 --> 01:02:18,900
It killed him in the movie.
Well,

1282
01:02:18,930 --> 01:02:19,330
no,
no,

1283
01:02:19,350 --> 01:02:19,680
no,
no.

1284
01:02:19,681 --> 01:02:22,770
John Dupont killed the,
an Olympic gold medalist in the movie,

1285
01:02:23,010 --> 01:02:24,900
but his brother,
Mark Schultz,

1286
01:02:24,901 --> 01:02:28,560
who the book the movie and the book is 
based on is still alive and they changed

1287
01:02:28,561 --> 01:02:31,470
all these aspects of his life for this 
movie and he's like,

1288
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:34,440
I'm still alive,
but this is me.

1289
01:02:34,740 --> 01:02:39,740
Like this isn't like a Chris Kyle thing 
where they made the movie after he's 

1290
01:02:39,740 --> 01:02:40,520
dead and who knows what,
you know,

1291
01:02:40,530 --> 01:02:43,290
he let put in and not put.
This is like mark was saying,

1292
01:02:43,470 --> 01:02:48,470
this didn't happen.
Like they messed with shit that didn't 

1293
01:02:48,470 --> 01:02:48,470
even make sense.
Like they had the UFC in their movie,

1294
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:52,450
but it was in 1988.
There was no fucking UFC until 1993.

1295
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:57,600
I didn't even exist.
So they're watching an actual fight 

1296
01:02:57,600 --> 01:03:01,400
between big daddy goodrich who was the 
eventual opponent of Mark Schultz and a 

1297
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:01,620
lot of people like,
you're real good.

1298
01:03:01,870 --> 01:03:04,260
You're all read true view.
Nobody gives a shit.

1299
01:03:04,261 --> 01:03:05,040
It's a both.
The story.

1300
01:03:05,190 --> 01:03:06,360
No,
it's not dummy.

1301
01:03:06,390 --> 01:03:11,390
It's about history because why would you
make up any aspects of history when 

1302
01:03:11,390 --> 01:03:15,060
you're doing a true story and you don't 
need to change the timeline for the UFC.

1303
01:03:15,150 --> 01:03:20,150
That's totally arbitrary.
Like someone deciding to do that is 

1304
01:03:20,150 --> 01:03:21,890
their own creative flair.
Just kissing,

1305
01:03:22,020 --> 01:03:25,170
just comping their balls and jizzing 
over history.

1306
01:03:25,380 --> 01:03:30,380
If you did that with that.
How the fuck am I going to believe any 

1307
01:03:30,380 --> 01:03:30,380
of the aspects of the story because you 
lied about something.

1308
01:03:30,380 --> 01:03:35,211
I know you lied about.
This is weird shit where there's like 

1309
01:03:35,211 --> 01:03:38,210
there's like this weird relationship 
between the two and they're looking at 

1310
01:03:38,210 --> 01:03:40,080
each other weird and he's wearing shorts
and now he's got frosted tips and people

1311
01:03:40,081 --> 01:03:45,081
were saying that it seemed like it was 
gay and shoulds got really upset that 

1312
01:03:45,081 --> 01:03:45,960
they were insinuating there was some 
sort of a gay relationship.

1313
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:51,320
They like fucked with the timeline of 
his achievements too because he had 

1314
01:03:51,320 --> 01:03:55,371
already won the world championships.
I mean he was already the best wrestler 

1315
01:03:55,371 --> 01:03:55,650
in the world,
in his weight class and they were making

1316
01:03:55,651 --> 01:03:58,910
it look like,
like he needed his brother and he was.

1317
01:03:58,911 --> 01:04:00,720
He was sucking in,
dupont was,

1318
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:05,920
his career was falling apart.
He was the best wrestler in his weight 

1319
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:05,920
class,
in the word mark.

1320
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:10,551
Fucking show was an animal.
If you watch him wrestle when he was at 

1321
01:04:10,551 --> 01:04:15,381
his peak form,
he was a fucking animal and like the 

1322
01:04:15,381 --> 01:04:18,540
changed like the aspects of his 
achievements in this movie,

1323
01:04:18,541 --> 01:04:23,541
like he was already a world champion,
like the way they made it and the way 

1324
01:04:23,541 --> 01:04:24,930
they.
It's like the guy was fucked and nothing

1325
01:04:24,931 --> 01:04:29,931
was going right for him and then he 
needed this John Dupont situation and 

1326
01:04:29,931 --> 01:04:31,250
that's why he moved in,
in a beautiful mind when,

1327
01:04:31,270 --> 01:04:32,640
when,
when the wife stuck with them,

1328
01:04:32,641 --> 01:04:33,770
even though it was going crazy.
Yeah.

1329
01:04:33,780 --> 01:04:35,220
The real life.
She just left.

1330
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:40,280
Of course,
soon as you run the bath water in the 

1331
01:04:40,280 --> 01:04:40,280
kitchen,
I was like,

1332
01:04:40,280 --> 01:04:40,280
I'm out.
I'm divorcing you.

1333
01:04:40,280 --> 01:04:40,280
It's over.
Yeah.

1334
01:04:40,280 --> 01:04:41,220
It was like,
we're going to make it together.

1335
01:04:41,230 --> 01:04:46,230
Baby is American snipers that were going
to tell the whole story like what whole 

1336
01:04:46,230 --> 01:04:51,141
story.
There was also a shitty father and 

1337
01:04:51,141 --> 01:04:51,141
husband.
I thinking about the Ari Shaffir story.

1338
01:04:51,141 --> 01:04:51,830
When it comes out,
they're going to.

1339
01:04:52,310 --> 01:04:55,560
They're going to show him like with a 
bag of mushrooms,

1340
01:04:55,561 --> 01:04:57,690
but he's like weeping as he eats.
I'm like,

1341
01:04:57,691 --> 01:05:02,691
I can't stop calling him.
Like Arya.

1342
01:05:03,230 --> 01:05:07,180
Got To stop eating those mushrooms.
No one is watching child porn.

1343
01:05:07,230 --> 01:05:08,520
Fuck you.
I don't even know why.

1344
01:05:08,580 --> 01:05:12,060
Why should it be legal?
I didn't fuck any kids.

1345
01:05:12,180 --> 01:05:15,450
Why isn't the video themselves legal and
put some words in your mouth.

1346
01:05:16,630 --> 01:05:18,400
Someone could could totally see.

1347
01:05:18,460 --> 01:05:20,380
Put it like on a newspaper quote or 
something.

1348
01:05:20,540 --> 01:05:25,540
I have it come up.
Did you ever see lenny with Dustin 

1349
01:05:25,540 --> 01:05:25,540
Hoffman?
You know,

1350
01:05:25,540 --> 01:05:25,540
I missed it.
I can see.

1351
01:05:25,540 --> 01:05:27,340
Look,
I'm a huge fucking Lenny Bruce Fan,

1352
01:05:27,341 --> 01:05:32,341
so I'm fascinated by.
I'm not a huge fan of is this is a 

1353
01:05:32,341 --> 01:05:36,931
tricky way to say it because like I 
think if I'm not endorsing what right 

1354
01:05:36,931 --> 01:05:41,041
now,
I'm saying like if you go like have 

1355
01:05:41,041 --> 01:05:41,041
lenny bruce is performing at the laugh 
factory.

1356
01:05:41,041 --> 01:05:42,460
Knew what the comedy store.
I would tell people to go see you.

1357
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:45,460
I would go because it wouldn't be freaky
just to see him,

1358
01:05:45,940 --> 01:05:49,000
but you're dealing with a completely 
different era.

1359
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:51,850
The world was just way different.
But anyway.

1360
01:05:51,851 --> 01:05:53,920
This is great.
Dustin Hoffman movie,

1361
01:05:53,921 --> 01:05:57,880
where Dustin Hoffman fucking nailed it.
He sounds just like lenny bruce.

1362
01:05:58,150 --> 01:06:03,150
I mean one of the few times where a 
guy's on stage and it seems like he's a 

1363
01:06:03,150 --> 01:06:03,150
real comic.

1364
01:06:03,150 --> 01:06:03,280
Huh?
It really,

1365
01:06:03,290 --> 01:06:06,280
it's really good.
But he says a bunch of Shit and you go,

1366
01:06:06,281 --> 01:06:07,480
did he say that?
How do I know?

1367
01:06:07,481 --> 01:06:08,570
He said that guy.
No,

1368
01:06:08,710 --> 01:06:13,710
you know,
I know you don't know exactly what came 

1369
01:06:13,710 --> 01:06:14,860
out of his mouth at any given moment.
So a lot of this is just bullshit.

1370
01:06:15,230 --> 01:06:15,990
You know?
So like if you,

1371
01:06:16,030 --> 01:06:21,030
there's a real person,
you got to try your best to make 

1372
01:06:21,030 --> 01:06:25,380
everything as on the money as possible.
Whatever you fill in has got to be 

1373
01:06:26,321 --> 01:06:29,140
directly related to everything that you 
absolutely know happen,

1374
01:06:29,290 --> 01:06:30,370
but you're not going to have to fill in 
stuff.

1375
01:06:30,371 --> 01:06:32,440
Like when he tells his wife he loves her
for the first time,

1376
01:06:32,441 --> 01:06:32,980
it's like,
that's your,

1377
01:06:32,981 --> 01:06:34,980
like I'm guessing this heart one.
It's fine.

1378
01:06:35,060 --> 01:06:38,560
Unless the wife's alive and she can tell
you that could help.

1379
01:06:38,950 --> 01:06:43,950
But I think what you're talking about is
a controversial subject.

1380
01:06:44,290 --> 01:06:48,300
I think some people say that you got 
creative license when things,

1381
01:06:48,330 --> 01:06:50,020
and you can say,
based on a true story,

1382
01:06:50,040 --> 01:06:55,040
it's.
This is a true story would look he's Ra 

1383
01:06:55,040 --> 01:06:57,100
Ra all the way.
He's a flag waving old man.

1384
01:06:57,610 --> 01:06:59,590
He really is.
All those old men stick together.

1385
01:06:59,770 --> 01:07:01,060
We'll look.
I think this is.

1386
01:07:01,061 --> 01:07:02,770
I mean,
does it look.

1387
01:07:03,100 --> 01:07:05,440
I think Howard Stern,
just saying he enjoyed it as a movie.

1388
01:07:05,441 --> 01:07:08,800
It's supposed to be a very good movie.
It was like well made as a movie.

1389
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:13,990
There was no story.
The acting was horrible.

1390
01:07:14,170 --> 01:07:17,440
There were some cool shit like fucking 
sleeping shots.

1391
01:07:17,780 --> 01:07:22,320
This thing was cool and that was it,
but it wasn't much labeled.

1392
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:27,600
He's not like a war,
like the one victim of bad guy wants to 

1393
01:07:27,731 --> 01:07:29,330
get the whole time.
It's like I don't understand.

1394
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:31,110
It's down to you,
man.

1395
01:07:31,120 --> 01:07:33,030
I think I've sat on the podcast called 
Atlanta.

1396
01:07:33,070 --> 01:07:36,010
Here's what it boils down to.
You want to use military equipment,

1397
01:07:36,011 --> 01:07:37,090
right?
And a movie.

1398
01:07:37,450 --> 01:07:40,340
You're not going to get your own fucking
tanks and where are you going to get the

1399
01:07:40,341 --> 01:07:45,341
military equipment from?
You're going to get the military 

1400
01:07:45,341 --> 01:07:47,050
equipment from the military and the 
military and you can load that's over on

1401
01:07:47,080 --> 01:07:49,270
this.
They get to have script approval,

1402
01:07:49,420 --> 01:07:54,420
so the military,
they look through your script and they 

1403
01:07:54,420 --> 01:07:56,821
make sure that the staff that is in your
script is going to get people down to 

1404
01:07:56,821 --> 01:07:59,990
their local recruiting office and that's
why they let you use their machinery.

1405
01:08:00,320 --> 01:08:04,450
Don't use it to send them to cooper that
there's never been an antiwar movie that

1406
01:08:04,451 --> 01:08:08,340
hasn't made an enlistment go up.
Antiwar movie.

1407
01:08:08,410 --> 01:08:13,410
Yeah.
You feel like you literally cannot make 

1408
01:08:13,410 --> 01:08:14,560
an antiwar movie because every single 
depiction of war makes people go,

1409
01:08:14,590 --> 01:08:15,130
oh,
that's cool.

1410
01:08:15,170 --> 01:08:15,950
Like platoon,

1411
01:08:16,490 --> 01:08:17,570
all of it,
all of it.

1412
01:08:17,571 --> 01:08:22,571
You can see the trend right afterwards.
Enlistments shoots up after those big 

1413
01:08:22,571 --> 01:08:23,870
movies tell you see the same front of 
Ryan.

1414
01:08:23,871 --> 01:08:25,520
The guy gets blown up the close night,
but everyone's like,

1415
01:08:25,580 --> 01:08:28,250
I want to be a sniper.
You forget the fact they got blown up.

1416
01:08:28,251 --> 01:08:33,251
His people like being violent and this 
is why Sebastian younger's book war is 

1417
01:08:33,251 --> 01:08:37,301
such an incredible book because it.
It portrays war with no attempt to be 

1418
01:08:37,911 --> 01:08:39,440
like,
this is right or this is wrong.

1419
01:08:39,620 --> 01:08:41,750
It just says if you take it.
I can't remember the exact wording,

1420
01:08:41,751 --> 01:08:46,751
but it's like if you take a 22 year old 
and put them behind one of those giant 

1421
01:08:46,751 --> 01:08:48,270
fucking southern.
Yeah,

1422
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:51,620
it feels good.
It's fun to like.

1423
01:08:52,730 --> 01:08:55,460
It feels like that's Bob.
He pulled love violence.

1424
01:08:55,580 --> 01:09:00,580
So if you can figure out a way to get 
people to be violent without the guilt 

1425
01:09:01,221 --> 01:09:06,221
that goes along with like you're killing
other members of your species than what 

1426
01:09:06,221 --> 01:09:06,230
do you do.

1427
01:09:06,350 --> 01:09:08,720
You create an imaginary story.
Right,

1428
01:09:08,810 --> 01:09:12,200
and the imaginary story in Iraq was the 
weapons of mass destruction.

1429
01:09:12,380 --> 01:09:14,380
Also,
Saddam Hussein,

1430
01:09:14,460 --> 01:09:15,750
what they said this movie like,
Oh,

1431
01:09:16,220 --> 01:09:18,860
if I don't do my job to come to San 
Diego and then knock on your door.

1432
01:09:19,730 --> 01:09:24,730
Apparently another aspect of the book 
that has been the question is that the,

1433
01:09:25,721 --> 01:09:28,910
the barrels of weapons of mass 
destruction that they found,

1434
01:09:29,180 --> 01:09:31,790
like he said that they found like 
chemical weapons.

1435
01:09:31,930 --> 01:09:32,660
Right?
Really?

1436
01:09:33,040 --> 01:09:38,040
Oh.
He said we actually saw them laid eyes 

1437
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:38,040
on them,
but they're like,

1438
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:38,040
well then why don't you tell anybody 
what,

1439
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:39,110
what do you mean?
Where's the enrichment?

1440
01:09:39,150 --> 01:09:44,150
Google search,
do a google search on birth defects in 

1441
01:09:44,150 --> 01:09:47,231
some of the parts of Iraq that we attack
because we used a shells that had some 

1442
01:09:47,231 --> 01:09:51,350
kind of radioactive isotope in it and 
now the babies are being born with birth

1443
01:09:51,351 --> 01:09:56,351
defects because the other thing people 
say is Saddam Hussein gas his own 

1444
01:09:56,351 --> 01:09:56,351
people,
right?

1445
01:09:56,351 --> 01:09:58,540
He gets his own people.
Well,

1446
01:09:58,620 --> 01:10:01,580
what are we doing to them?
And we're dropping all these bombs.

1447
01:10:01,640 --> 01:10:03,140
Targeted strikes,
man.

1448
01:10:03,141 --> 01:10:05,000
They know exactly where they're heading.
No,

1449
01:10:05,001 --> 01:10:06,170
they don't.
People,

1450
01:10:06,230 --> 01:10:10,850
babies are being born with severe birth 
defects because of what we did there.

1451
01:10:10,851 --> 01:10:15,110
So I think in a movie like that,
you need to at least illustrate the fact

1452
01:10:15,290 --> 01:10:20,290
that the reason that man was sitting on 
the tops of buildings in that area,

1453
01:10:20,570 --> 01:10:22,130
killing them people was,
he was,

1454
01:10:22,460 --> 01:10:27,460
was because he was sent there based on 
bad information to say the least.

1455
01:10:27,990 --> 01:10:30,530
And uh,
the people he's killing,

1456
01:10:30,620 --> 01:10:33,710
like in the very beginning,
it's like anybody over the age of 18,

1457
01:10:33,860 --> 01:10:38,060
this is anybody over the age of 18 in 
this area.

1458
01:10:38,090 --> 01:10:42,350
This is an evacuation zone.
So there's no one except people that are

1459
01:10:42,351 --> 01:10:43,940
out to kill us.
It's all open game.

1460
01:10:43,941 --> 01:10:44,900
It's like,
oh wait a minute.

1461
01:10:44,900 --> 01:10:46,760
So you're saying that because the first 
shot,

1462
01:10:46,761 --> 01:10:51,761
so don't worry about this question,
but morally know anyone who was there 

1463
01:10:51,761 --> 01:10:52,250
over 18,
that's what they're there for.

1464
01:10:52,370 --> 01:10:56,420
Monsters did not leave the city that we 
bombed,

1465
01:10:56,630 --> 01:11:00,290
that they lived in when we told them to.
So if they're still here,

1466
01:11:00,500 --> 01:11:03,260
kill and then still like shows 
restraint.

1467
01:11:03,340 --> 01:11:04,670
And then when he found the house,
it was a kid,

1468
01:11:04,671 --> 01:11:09,671
but he has a fucking grenade launcher.
He waits until the kids running at the 

1469
01:11:09,671 --> 01:11:10,730
fuck is about to throw it.
And then he shoots him.

1470
01:11:11,150 --> 01:11:13,590
But it's totally just shooting kid.

1471
01:11:14,180 --> 01:11:15,780
And then the mom,
what the fuck

1472
01:11:15,790 --> 01:11:17,560
and wait.
But why would they be angry?

1473
01:11:17,561 --> 01:11:19,150
I mean really?
Why would you be angry?

1474
01:11:19,240 --> 01:11:21,820
They only destroyed your city that you 
lived in.

1475
01:11:22,060 --> 01:11:25,210
This is another thing of why we 
shouldn't marines.

1476
01:11:25,810 --> 01:11:28,030
Why the Marines right there where they 
can get shot,

1477
01:11:28,610 --> 01:11:31,390
remember thousands of miles away back to
America.

1478
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:37,640
Well we were saying earlier about 
ideologies are the problem and being a 

1479
01:11:37,640 --> 01:11:40,030
nationalistic person,
subscribing and being a patriot,

1480
01:11:40,031 --> 01:11:43,870
subscribing to one nation only 
regardless of what the actual act itself

1481
01:11:43,871 --> 01:11:45,510
is.
Looking at it like this.

1482
01:11:45,580 --> 01:11:50,580
Okay.
Because it's one of the books like that 

1483
01:11:50,580 --> 01:11:50,580
is an ideology.
There you go.

1484
01:11:50,580 --> 01:11:51,910
That is as much of an ideology as a 
religion.

1485
01:11:52,330 --> 01:11:54,470
It's an unquestioning thing.
Like,

1486
01:11:54,790 --> 01:11:56,500
you know,
one of the things that Michael Moore was

1487
01:11:56,501 --> 01:11:59,050
saying was that he put it on his 
twitter,

1488
01:11:59,080 --> 01:12:02,710
his twitter that a sniper as a coward 
and everybody got really pissed off.

1489
01:12:03,070 --> 01:12:04,780
You know,
like the,

1490
01:12:04,781 --> 01:12:07,090
I think the logic behind is kind of 
silly.

1491
01:12:07,270 --> 01:12:09,010
Like you have to look them in the eye 
when you shoot him.

1492
01:12:09,011 --> 01:12:10,990
Like shooting someone in the back is a 
coward.

1493
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:16,200
Like well in that sense 90 percent of 
war is cowardly because you're,

1494
01:12:16,201 --> 01:12:17,840
you're saying some kind of wars.

1495
01:12:17,890 --> 01:12:20,020
Okay.
But some kind of what you have rules.

1496
01:12:20,050 --> 01:12:20,720
Yeah.
Yeah.

1497
01:12:20,750 --> 01:12:23,800
Look at somebody with or the back or 
like what about a from 100 yards?

1498
01:12:23,820 --> 01:12:25,690
How about rock,
but that means no more rockets.

1499
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:30,880
That means a lot of them want to do is 
you're shooting people like you don't 

1500
01:12:31,301 --> 01:12:33,250
necessarily look them in the eye when 
you shoot them.

1501
01:12:33,251 --> 01:12:35,270
Are you having a dual?
Like what are you doing?

1502
01:12:35,300 --> 01:12:38,110
Standing back to back and walking 10 
paces like assholes,

1503
01:12:38,111 --> 01:12:39,550
like what kind of is the reason to be 
there?

1504
01:12:39,551 --> 01:12:42,040
Can you look at some of the negative 
effects that we want to pull those back?

1505
01:12:42,290 --> 01:12:46,360
Like what if 30 percent of children the 
Yemen have ptsd now because of drones?

1506
01:12:46,940 --> 01:12:51,940
I can't say that's a negative.
It's really important that that 

1507
01:12:51,940 --> 01:12:54,851
information gets out there when you are 
putting a movie out that's going to get 

1508
01:12:54,851 --> 01:12:59,171
people in the same way.
Like when Beverly Hills Chihuahua came 

1509
01:12:59,171 --> 01:13:01,961
out,
everybody bought a Chihuahua and the 

1510
01:13:01,961 --> 01:13:03,830
pounds filled up with your hours because
they also have a sniper.

1511
01:13:03,831 --> 01:13:08,270
Is gonna do the exact same thing for 
people who are a little confused on what

1512
01:13:08,271 --> 01:13:10,130
to do in their lives and they're going 
to think,

1513
01:13:10,131 --> 01:13:15,131
well,
I guess the best thing I can do right 

1514
01:13:15,131 --> 01:13:16,610
now is kill people that my government 
tells me are evil.

1515
01:13:16,611 --> 01:13:21,611
Even though if I study the facts,
I find that it's a far more complex 

1516
01:13:22,071 --> 01:13:27,071
issue than that and maybe my decision 
should not be to become a hired killer 

1517
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:32,440
for people who are telling me that 
actually killed people who more than 

1518
01:13:32,440 --> 01:13:35,861
likely are innocent or just trying to 
defend their home from an invading 

1519
01:13:36,321 --> 01:13:37,520
occupying force.

1520
01:13:37,820 --> 01:13:39,560
It's really important to realize that.
Now.

1521
01:13:39,561 --> 01:13:43,670
I'm not saying all war is bad because 
some people will be like,

1522
01:13:43,671 --> 01:13:45,890
you naive son of a bitch.
You don't even realize.

1523
01:13:46,040 --> 01:13:48,620
Let me repeat the speech.
At the beginning of American sniper,

1524
01:13:48,950 --> 01:13:51,840
this is what the day the speech,
so test.

1525
01:13:51,860 --> 01:13:56,120
Here's the speech the dad gives at the 
dinner table after the American sniper.

1526
01:13:56,121 --> 01:13:57,560
What's his name?
Chris.

1527
01:13:57,561 --> 01:13:58,860
What was his name?
Chris.

1528
01:13:58,861 --> 01:14:03,861
Because Chris Kyle is just defended his 
brother from a beating by a bully and 

1529
01:14:04,371 --> 01:14:09,371
they're sitting around the table.
His brothers got bruised up a little 

1530
01:14:09,371 --> 01:14:12,971
bit.
Chris Kyle's sitting there and his dad 

1531
01:14:12,971 --> 01:14:12,971
gives this.
There's three

1532
01:14:12,971 --> 01:14:14,620
types of people.
Hold on before you get the speech.

1533
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:20,280
He goes,
I was just defending my brother and he 

1534
01:14:20,280 --> 01:14:20,280
looks at the little brother with a black
guy and he goes,

1535
01:14:20,280 --> 01:14:20,440
is that true?
Like,

1536
01:14:20,470 --> 01:14:22,600
what do you mean?
Obviously he has a black guy.

1537
01:14:22,630 --> 01:14:24,080
He just got beat up.
That's right.

1538
01:14:24,890 --> 01:14:26,620
That's right.
What a shitty movie.

1539
01:14:26,621 --> 01:14:27,540
Is that true?
He goes,

1540
01:14:27,570 --> 01:14:29,960
Yep.
It is three tax people in the world.

1541
01:14:30,310 --> 01:14:32,650
Three types.
There's sheeps.

1542
01:14:32,890 --> 01:14:36,850
Needs are the people who believe that 
there aren't evil people in the world,

1543
01:14:36,851 --> 01:14:39,270
and by the way,
I'm paraphrasing your own.

1544
01:14:41,650 --> 01:14:46,650
These are the people who believe that 
there aren't even people in the world 

1545
01:14:46,650 --> 01:14:49,390
and that everything is safe,
and then there's the wolfs and these are

1546
01:14:49,391 --> 01:14:54,280
the people who try to use eval to 
overpower others,

1547
01:14:54,281 --> 01:14:59,281
something like that.
And then there's the sheep dogs and 

1548
01:14:59,281 --> 01:14:59,281
these are the people who defend the 
sheep.

1549
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:01,420
Oh God,
what are you going to be?

1550
01:15:01,480 --> 01:15:03,910
It goes,
if you're anything,

1551
01:15:03,940 --> 01:15:08,610
if you're the sheep or the wolf,
and he took his belt off and puts down,

1552
01:15:08,910 --> 01:15:13,910
will be fucked us up.
Your us.

1553
01:15:16,030 --> 01:15:16,750
Watch it,
man.

1554
01:15:16,751 --> 01:15:19,690
It is from the very beginning.
It's pure.

1555
01:15:19,960 --> 01:15:22,520
It really is like the way were talking 
about how,

1556
01:15:22,590 --> 01:15:23,010
how,
uh,

1557
01:15:23,110 --> 01:15:25,260
soldiers are on their dying breath will 
tell him.

1558
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:30,360
I'm just glad I got to tell that story.
Telling that story.

1559
01:15:36,020 --> 01:15:38,000
Story,
story.

1560
01:15:38,110 --> 01:15:43,110
He told me.
I remember going around telling people 

1561
01:15:43,110 --> 01:15:43,110
like y'all.
I met his,

1562
01:15:43,110 --> 01:15:43,110
his,
uh,

1563
01:15:43,110 --> 01:15:43,990
his fucking buddies and arms when he was
dying.

1564
01:15:43,991 --> 01:15:44,440
He was like,
you know,

1565
01:15:44,450 --> 01:15:49,450
I got married and at least I got it.
All right.

1566
01:15:56,591 --> 01:15:58,740
I would imagine if that really did 
happen though,

1567
01:15:58,750 --> 01:16:03,160
that's,
that's Saturday than him lying.

1568
01:16:05,630 --> 01:16:08,980
Assuming it didn't happen,
but people are definitely dumb enough to

1569
01:16:08,981 --> 01:16:13,981
do that you don't understand about the 
punisher tour of was magical.

1570
01:16:17,260 --> 01:16:20,170
Oh my God.
Wow.

1571
01:16:21,160 --> 01:16:23,530
That's fucking hilarious.
Last words,

1572
01:16:23,590 --> 01:16:24,460
you know,
like I'll be like,

1573
01:16:24,461 --> 01:16:26,290
but what about,
what about him stealing jokes?

1574
01:16:26,440 --> 01:16:28,450
His last words,
but he did it better.

1575
01:16:31,170 --> 01:16:33,080
Better,
better,

1576
01:16:34,660 --> 01:16:37,450
different in my country,
man.

1577
01:16:39,130 --> 01:16:43,870
Already I will give you $100,000
if on your death bed you say the least,

1578
01:16:43,871 --> 01:16:47,960
I got $200,000.
It would really give him 100,000

1579
01:16:47,961 --> 01:16:49,060
dollars.
And how would he use it?

1580
01:16:49,061 --> 01:16:52,910
He's dead.
Oh No,

1581
01:16:53,130 --> 01:16:55,870
you won't need this and I am one of your
best friends.

1582
01:16:55,871 --> 01:16:59,400
So aspiration.
At least.

1583
01:16:59,530 --> 01:17:03,370
Like I said,
I got that back by the way,

1584
01:17:03,580 --> 01:17:05,170
by storytelling show.
This is not happy.

1585
01:17:05,171 --> 01:17:09,980
Premieres this Thursday with Bobby 
Meibomian Keegan key and

1586
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:15,000
Dunkin.
We've done these extra stories that 

1587
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,531
we're doing for the web only they'll be 
on youtube and Dunkin's premiering 

1588
01:17:17,531 --> 01:17:18,210
tomorrow.
That's all right.

1589
01:17:18,240 --> 01:17:21,290
That's all I can tell.
A cool story about going to LSD trip.

1590
01:17:21,410 --> 01:17:26,410
Grateful dead concert.
Is there a reason they didn't want to 

1591
01:17:26,410 --> 01:17:28,061
put that on television?
The to book another white male was 

1592
01:17:28,061 --> 01:17:30,260
nearly impossible and too many white 
males.

1593
01:17:30,290 --> 01:17:31,840
Did you need diversity training?
Yeah.

1594
01:17:31,910 --> 01:17:33,380
There was like,
who else can we get?

1595
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:38,520
That's a little knock that out of your 
way to look for non white males.

1596
01:17:39,990 --> 01:17:42,290
Yeah,
so it's a Jerry Seinfeld type situation.

1597
01:17:42,350 --> 01:17:42,800
Yeah.
They're like,

1598
01:17:42,801 --> 01:17:44,090
look,
we'll just going to get to attack.

1599
01:17:44,100 --> 01:17:46,880
If you don't get some others to attack,
it's just like bottom line.

1600
01:17:46,881 --> 01:17:49,570
It was just fucking pissed about that.
What is it?

1601
01:17:49,580 --> 01:17:51,260
The Oscars,
they don't have to get half,

1602
01:17:51,680 --> 01:17:53,810
but they just got.
You got to be representative.

1603
01:17:54,020 --> 01:17:58,310
That's so crazy about the Oscars.
It's all like all white people.

1604
01:17:59,180 --> 01:18:03,650
Black people are being excluded and less
Asian people are being excluded.

1605
01:18:05,040 --> 01:18:06,500
Joey does.
Yeah.

1606
01:18:06,620 --> 01:18:11,620
Those are both fucking ethnos,
but you can't have affirmative action 

1607
01:18:11,620 --> 01:18:14,190
comedy.
Your account,

1608
01:18:14,260 --> 01:18:16,280
you're going to ruin the whole thing.
You can't do that.

1609
01:18:16,281 --> 01:18:18,820
You can't like you will.
Whoever's funny you got to say,

1610
01:18:19,040 --> 01:18:19,460
yeah,
yeah,

1611
01:18:19,461 --> 01:18:24,461
yeah,
but you get what you can do it like 

1612
01:18:24,461 --> 01:18:24,461
this.
Like show me the pool of people that are

1613
01:18:24,461 --> 01:18:25,310
qualified and you show them 100 people,
like two of those.

1614
01:18:25,490 --> 01:18:27,920
There's only six blacks that are 
qualified of those hundreds,

1615
01:18:27,921 --> 01:18:30,530
but pick two of them.
I don't mind being on the Internet.

1616
01:18:30,531 --> 01:18:31,520
I love the Internet.
Yeah.

1617
01:18:31,530 --> 01:18:34,940
That's where I live is on the flip side.
It can be way longer to just like we did

1618
01:18:34,941 --> 01:18:35,900
last year,
completely,

1619
01:18:35,901 --> 01:18:40,901
like don't worry about any.
The one that you put that we did that 

1620
01:18:40,901 --> 01:18:40,901
was on the Internet.

1621
01:18:40,901 --> 01:18:41,390
It was great.
It was fun.

1622
01:18:41,480 --> 01:18:44,390
It was just actually before the show was
even on TV.

1623
01:18:44,620 --> 01:18:46,880
It's totally awesome to have something 
on the Internet.

1624
01:18:46,881 --> 01:18:51,800
I was just confused as to the reasoning 
for it because it came later to Eric,

1625
01:18:51,801 --> 01:18:52,940
the guy who runs it with me,
he was like,

1626
01:18:52,970 --> 01:18:53,600
Hey,
let's do it.

1627
01:18:53,601 --> 01:18:57,590
Also a web series,
the web series and that way goes to.

1628
01:18:57,591 --> 01:19:00,050
It's like if we show some short ones,
we want to bump somebody up.

1629
01:19:00,051 --> 01:19:05,051
We can.
If they're a good short story Rothbart 

1630
01:19:05,051 --> 01:19:05,051
and with Ms Dot Pat.
You know what though?

1631
01:19:05,051 --> 01:19:07,280
It's fucking awesome about the web too.
It doesn't get canceled.

1632
01:19:07,340 --> 01:19:09,380
Doesn't get canceled.
It's on anytime you want.

1633
01:19:09,410 --> 01:19:11,900
It's actually a way better medium for 
distribution.

1634
01:19:12,350 --> 01:19:14,120
Like a youtube channels.
Way Better.

1635
01:19:14,121 --> 01:19:18,590
Especially now you have youtube on apple
tv so you can go right to youtube.

1636
01:19:18,830 --> 01:19:23,830
Yeah,
I mean you can get youtube on a lot of 

1637
01:19:23,830 --> 01:19:23,830
those little netflix.

1638
01:19:23,830 --> 01:19:25,010
You can watch tv,
you can watch them on your phone.

1639
01:19:25,011 --> 01:19:27,620
You can watch anywhere you want it.
If it's on comedy central,

1640
01:19:27,621 --> 01:19:29,630
you're going to be guaranteed a very 
large audience,

1641
01:19:30,020 --> 01:19:35,020
you know,
like million plus audience of people 

1642
01:19:35,020 --> 01:19:35,020
sitting there watching a lot of them 
that aren't even your fans.

1643
01:19:35,020 --> 01:19:39,160
When you get good online,
you're going to get all of your fans so 

1644
01:19:39,160 --> 01:19:40,220
they watch it more intently.
See your name right there.

1645
01:19:40,221 --> 01:19:42,220
It's way easier for them.
Like to fan wise,

1646
01:19:42,840 --> 01:19:44,950
we want to do it on TV.
Like okay,

1647
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:45,700
that's a no weapons.
No,

1648
01:19:45,710 --> 01:19:45,880
no,
no,

1649
01:19:45,910 --> 01:19:46,580
no,
no,

1650
01:19:46,581 --> 01:19:46,820
no,
no.

1651
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:52,200
Also all those stories go on the web.
Let's make a cool looking clip story 

1652
01:19:52,200 --> 01:19:54,290
about trying to buy acid in a parking 
lot on tv.

1653
01:19:54,320 --> 01:19:55,540
Exactly.
Like black,

1654
01:19:55,580 --> 01:20:00,580
white one that's great.
About some sex and a dog is involved and

1655
01:20:00,921 --> 01:20:02,510
they're like,
you're not doing beastiality on here.

1656
01:20:02,980 --> 01:20:04,760
Put It on the web though.
Like five golden.

1657
01:20:04,761 --> 01:20:06,270
I don't care.
As long as that area.

1658
01:20:06,340 --> 01:20:08,040
I just think the way,
like if

1659
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:09,400
I get to choose.
Yeah,

1660
01:20:09,450 --> 01:20:12,480
doc had said that because I don't even 
want to say like I'd rather be the wet.

1661
01:20:12,481 --> 01:20:13,820
You can say whatever the fuck you want.
Yeah,

1662
01:20:13,910 --> 01:20:14,730
I would.
Yeah,

1663
01:20:14,731 --> 01:20:15,690
for sure.
Because they,

1664
01:20:15,730 --> 01:20:18,570
cause he called me and he's like,
can we go through what your story is?

1665
01:20:18,690 --> 01:20:23,690
The idea being if we can,
like maybe we can make it so it could 

1666
01:20:23,690 --> 01:20:23,690
possibly be on TV.
And I said,

1667
01:20:23,690 --> 01:20:28,250
oh no,
I just rather not be on TV because I 

1668
01:20:28,250 --> 01:20:28,410
don't want to deal.
I don't want to worry about that.

1669
01:20:28,411 --> 01:20:33,411
I don't want to think about that because
the story I'm telling is a story about 

1670
01:20:33,411 --> 01:20:36,870
being in high school,
trying to buy drugs and uh,

1671
01:20:36,880 --> 01:20:41,040
in just the worst slash best acid trip I
ever had in my life.

1672
01:20:41,100 --> 01:20:42,830
You don't even have to worry about 
someone going,

1673
01:20:43,090 --> 01:20:48,090
can you make it sound a little less pro 
the we won't get into it because I am 

1674
01:20:48,090 --> 01:20:52,071
pro lsd and the moment they actually say
that maybe could happen,

1675
01:20:52,650 --> 01:20:54,260
you know,
like my special Ed.

1676
01:20:54,260 --> 01:20:57,570
Go do more drugs.
I do drugs.

1677
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:01,250
What drugs?
Most rooms.

1678
01:21:01,290 --> 01:21:03,930
Other sort of like a bill look like 
you'll never.

1679
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:05,580
There's nothing ever bad happened to 
you.

1680
01:21:06,180 --> 01:21:07,770
Bush gets in office.
That could be an issue.

1681
01:21:08,580 --> 01:21:09,630
Well,
yeah,

1682
01:21:09,631 --> 01:21:11,010
I mean there's a statute.
I mean,

1683
01:21:11,011 --> 01:21:12,630
you could it.
Could it be an issue?

1684
01:21:12,631 --> 01:21:15,300
Is that really loud cry all both.
You stop it.

1685
01:21:15,301 --> 01:21:16,980
You're going to get ideas in their 
heads.

1686
01:21:17,700 --> 01:21:22,700
For sure.
She's talking about a schedule one 

1687
01:21:22,700 --> 01:21:22,700
drugs.
Oh,

1688
01:21:22,910 --> 01:21:24,330
comedy central's heads that what you're 
saying.

1689
01:21:24,350 --> 01:21:25,830
You're not worried about the 
politicians.

1690
01:21:25,860 --> 01:21:28,780
Oh No,
don't be pussies.

1691
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:31,470
You guys are rebels.
I think with mushrooms especially,

1692
01:21:31,560 --> 01:21:34,140
I think mushrooms like,
okay,

1693
01:21:34,141 --> 01:21:36,270
remember when marijuana was deeply 
illegal,

1694
01:21:36,271 --> 01:21:41,271
way back in the day,
you'd fantasize with your friends about 

1695
01:21:41,271 --> 01:21:44,181
the idea of marijuana becoming legalized
and you can see that it could be on the 

1696
01:21:44,181 --> 01:21:44,760
horizon maybe,
but it was still kind of like,

1697
01:21:44,761 --> 01:21:45,750
it's never going to be legal.

1698
01:21:45,750 --> 01:21:49,320
It's a ridiculous dream.
I think mushrooms is the new marijuana.

1699
01:21:49,890 --> 01:21:51,780
Mushrooms is gonna.
Silicide.

1700
01:21:52,080 --> 01:21:57,080
Ben is going to become a prescription 
medication that's given to people to 

1701
01:21:57,080 --> 01:21:57,580
stop smoking.
Yeah,

1702
01:21:57,590 --> 01:21:57,930
yeah,
yeah,

1703
01:21:57,931 --> 01:21:59,340
exactly.
That's going to happen.

1704
01:21:59,370 --> 01:22:01,200
They'll wilson once,
once they start realizing that there are

1705
01:22:01,201 --> 01:22:03,480
medical benefits that they're looking 
like they're proving that.

1706
01:22:03,481 --> 01:22:05,520
It's like they'll try to separate them 
again.

1707
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:08,300
Thank God for Doblin,
right?

1708
01:22:08,490 --> 01:22:09,440
Oh yeah.
He's at.

1709
01:22:09,480 --> 01:22:12,360
He's a champion hero.
That guy is a,

1710
01:22:12,570 --> 01:22:16,380
that guy deserves to be a,
deserves a Nobel prize for the work he's

1711
01:22:16,381 --> 01:22:21,381
doing for a second because he's doing 
stringent hardcore studies proving that 

1712
01:22:22,261 --> 01:22:25,170
many of these psychoactive compounds 
have medicinals up.

1713
01:22:25,530 --> 01:22:30,530
Rick Doblin from the Multidisciplinary 
Association for Psychedelic studies 

1714
01:22:31,050 --> 01:22:34,410
maps.
It's just they do these like real stuff.

1715
01:22:34,440 --> 01:22:37,470
They will hardcore studies where it's 
undeniable,

1716
01:22:37,471 --> 01:22:42,471
oh look,
what do you know silicide been helps 

1717
01:22:42,471 --> 01:22:44,520
longterm smokers quit and when you 
compare it to Chantix,

1718
01:22:45,060 --> 01:22:50,060
it's like the silicide minutes a million
times better because it'll help with my 

1719
01:22:50,060 --> 01:22:50,430
depression.
Yeah,

1720
01:22:50,431 --> 01:22:51,660
it does.
It heals.

1721
01:22:51,661 --> 01:22:56,661
You,
changes the way your brain is 

1722
01:22:56,661 --> 01:22:59,211
functioning you the path that you're on.
I think the past year on like someone 

1723
01:22:59,211 --> 01:23:04,120
tried to explain this to me once a voice
try to remember the exact way it's 

1724
01:23:04,120 --> 01:23:06,250
explained,
but that we want to think

1725
01:23:06,250 --> 01:23:10,570
of our moments as being moments 
individual unto themselves,

1726
01:23:10,630 --> 01:23:15,630
but they're not.
They're a chain of unique moments 

1727
01:23:15,630 --> 01:23:19,411
throughout your entire life.
Your interpretations of those unique 

1728
01:23:19,411 --> 01:23:22,531
moments.
I'm paraphrasing the shit out of this 

1729
01:23:22,531 --> 01:23:22,531
guy,
said it,

1730
01:23:22,531 --> 01:23:25,230
and then all of your associations with 
life itself that are connected to your 

1731
01:23:25,571 --> 01:23:28,000
interpretations of these moments and 
then boom,

1732
01:23:28,180 --> 01:23:31,750
here you are today and you want to think
that this is life,

1733
01:23:31,960 --> 01:23:36,960
but it's only life because of all these 
pathways that you've carved in the way 

1734
01:23:37,061 --> 01:23:40,420
you view the world.
As soon as you change those pathways,

1735
01:23:40,840 --> 01:23:45,840
you open up a whole new world because 
now your associations are different,

1736
01:23:46,420 --> 01:23:51,420
so now your brain's reaction to life 
changing your route to work and almost 

1737
01:23:51,420 --> 01:23:51,420
saying like,
oh,

1738
01:23:51,420 --> 01:23:53,740
look at these stores for your

1739
01:23:53,990 --> 01:23:58,990
in chemistry,
and it's such a great feeling when ever 

1740
01:23:58,990 --> 01:24:00,930
any if that happens just slightly 
because a lot of people are in a cave in

1741
01:24:00,931 --> 01:24:05,931
situation when it comes to their lives.
They're literally buried under a series 

1742
01:24:05,931 --> 01:24:10,811
of antiquated,
stale symbols that they're looking at 

1743
01:24:10,811 --> 01:24:12,710
the universe through and they feel 
trapped.

1744
01:24:12,860 --> 01:24:17,860
It's like their shoes are too tight and 
if like a psychedelic or meditating too,

1745
01:24:19,011 --> 01:24:24,011
and I really mean that.
I'm not just saying that to because of 

1746
01:24:24,011 --> 01:24:24,011
that,
because I'm.

1747
01:24:24,011 --> 01:24:25,550
I really think meditation has a very 
similar effect,

1748
01:24:25,700 --> 01:24:28,790
but any of these things,
they reset those symbols,

1749
01:24:28,791 --> 01:24:33,791
structures in your brain and if you just
like if you're in a cave in and you get 

1750
01:24:33,791 --> 01:24:36,710
an extra inch compared to like being 
compressed against the wall,

1751
01:24:36,770 --> 01:24:40,280
that's a big fucking deal man.
So it's slightly percentage difference.

1752
01:24:40,290 --> 01:24:45,290
Change change is like,
oh thank God I'm 13 percent less 

1753
01:24:46,161 --> 01:24:48,620
frightened than I was for my entire 
life.

1754
01:24:48,710 --> 01:24:52,640
Have you ever heard Tony Robbins talk 
about changing paths in life is a really

1755
01:24:52,670 --> 01:24:56,120
interesting analogy.
He talks about like you're going to cars

1756
01:24:56,300 --> 01:25:01,300
going the exactly saying or a boat or 
two boats going exactly the same 

1757
01:25:01,300 --> 01:25:04,691
direction,
but one boat just takes a two degree 

1758
01:25:04,691 --> 01:25:04,930
turn,
just two degrees here.

1759
01:25:05,180 --> 01:25:09,740
As they go further down the one boat 
that took two degree turn is going to go

1760
01:25:09,741 --> 01:25:14,741
wider and wider away from the original 
path and that each decision that you 

1761
01:25:14,741 --> 01:25:14,741
make,
that's a good decision.

1762
01:25:14,960 --> 01:25:19,960
Takes you closer.
Like even though it's just like you're 

1763
01:25:19,960 --> 01:25:21,350
just steering your ship,
just dirt as you go out.

1764
01:25:21,650 --> 01:25:26,650
It's going to be a much different path,
much different end than if you just 

1765
01:25:26,650 --> 01:25:28,700
stayed on the original path.
That's incredible.

1766
01:25:28,930 --> 01:25:31,460
The different and psychedelics makes you
go right.

1767
01:25:31,461 --> 01:25:36,050
Turn Clyde,
looking at the.

1768
01:25:36,190 --> 01:25:36,650
The,
the,

1769
01:25:36,670 --> 01:25:38,240
the currents.
Try to bring you back though.

1770
01:25:38,300 --> 01:25:43,300
Yes.
Well Ego tries to keep the current kind 

1771
01:25:43,300 --> 01:25:43,430
of bring it back to where you were gone 
so it's got to take them a good.

1772
01:25:43,610 --> 01:25:48,610
Well,
I've always said get off that current 

1773
01:25:48,610 --> 01:25:50,510
doing psychedelics.
It's like pressing the reset button for 

1774
01:25:50,510 --> 01:25:50,510
your brain,
like control all the,

1775
01:25:51,220 --> 01:25:56,220
your,
your desktop reboots and there's only 

1776
01:25:56,220 --> 01:25:58,340
one folder on the desktop that desktop 
says the folder says my old bullshit and

1777
01:25:58,341 --> 01:26:01,550
you have two choices.
Either you just like create a completely

1778
01:26:01,551 --> 01:26:03,320
different desktop.
Look at reality,

1779
01:26:03,500 --> 01:26:08,500
a completely different or open up my old
bullshit and fall back into these 

1780
01:26:08,500 --> 01:26:09,770
familiar patterns because they're very 
comforting,

1781
01:26:09,980 --> 01:26:14,980
right?
You know in those moments after the 

1782
01:26:14,980 --> 01:26:17,711
psychedelic experience are so important 
to grab and hang onto because it gives 

1783
01:26:17,711 --> 01:26:22,511
you this opportunity to make this new 
way of thinking like a part of your 

1784
01:26:22,511 --> 01:26:22,880
habit.
Once you get into that habit,

1785
01:26:22,881 --> 01:26:24,560
whether it's fucking,
you know,

1786
01:26:24,561 --> 01:26:29,561
the 30 days or 60 days or 90 days,
like people say that once you like have 

1787
01:26:29,561 --> 01:26:34,331
a pattern ingrained in how you behave 
and think and do it just takes a 

1788
01:26:34,331 --> 01:26:38,891
consistent approach to that pattern and 
then it becomes like an like a part of 

1789
01:26:38,891 --> 01:26:40,250
you like that's why people quit smoking.

1790
01:26:40,250 --> 01:26:43,040
Like get past 90 days and you'll be all 
right.

1791
01:26:43,050 --> 01:26:44,660
Right.
Jews say when you have,

1792
01:26:44,740 --> 01:26:46,500
if you go sit in the same feed three 
times,

1793
01:26:46,501 --> 01:26:47,780
he's just keep sitting there.
That's your,

1794
01:26:47,830 --> 01:26:48,840
that's your do all time.
Suit.

1795
01:26:50,060 --> 01:26:52,660
That's smart.
Makes Sense.

1796
01:26:53,460 --> 01:26:58,460
When you take a psychedelic,
it's like if your life is a polluted 

1797
01:26:58,460 --> 01:26:58,460
city,
like what are those polluted like what's

1798
01:26:58,460 --> 01:26:59,610
Detroit?
Detroit,

1799
01:26:59,640 --> 01:27:04,640
right?
And it's like the psychedelic all of a 

1800
01:27:04,640 --> 01:27:06,060
sudden takes you in a helicopter outside
the pollution and so now you're seeing,

1801
01:27:06,780 --> 01:27:08,460
Oh God,
the air up here so fresh.

1802
01:27:08,461 --> 01:27:13,461
It's so nice.
But the thing is helicopters going to 

1803
01:27:13,461 --> 01:27:13,461
land,
it's going to put you back out into your

1804
01:27:13,461 --> 01:27:15,700
city and that's where the job starts,
which is like,

1805
01:27:15,780 --> 01:27:18,080
shit man.
I don't remember if the city was wearing

1806
01:27:18,090 --> 01:27:21,330
like how can I clean this fucking thing 
up and then that's,

1807
01:27:21,360 --> 01:27:26,360
that's like the,
that's when you start doing things like 

1808
01:27:26,360 --> 01:27:26,360
exercising,
meditating,

1809
01:27:26,360 --> 01:27:30,890
or that's where you like create just a 
very simple intention in everything you 

1810
01:27:30,890 --> 01:27:31,830
do,
which is as much as possible.

1811
01:27:31,830 --> 01:27:36,420
I'm going to try to alleviate the 
suffering of people around me as much as

1812
01:27:36,421 --> 01:27:37,650
I can,
you know,

1813
01:27:37,651 --> 01:27:38,840
not.
That might not be a lot.

1814
01:27:38,910 --> 01:27:42,880
It might just be call.
It might just be those two.

1815
01:27:42,930 --> 01:27:47,930
We got back from,
from this last UFC just a little bit of 

1816
01:27:47,930 --> 01:27:50,841
mushrooms was enough.
I saw a homeless guy and he was looking 

1817
01:27:50,841 --> 01:27:50,841
for.
I was like,

1818
01:27:50,841 --> 01:27:50,910
I open my wallet and I only have 
twenties,

1819
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:51,630
and I was like,
no,

1820
01:27:52,180 --> 01:27:53,520
fuck it.
There you go.

1821
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,130
That's what it does.
And those little moments,

1822
01:27:56,131 --> 01:28:01,131
man,
it shows you that you get those moments 

1823
01:28:01,131 --> 01:28:01,230
present themselves to you all day,
fucking long,

1824
01:28:01,470 --> 01:28:04,050
but if you are stuck in selfishness,
you don't see it.

1825
01:28:04,280 --> 01:28:06,090
Yeah.
It's real simple little things,

1826
01:28:06,420 --> 01:28:08,520
but it's fun.
It's a very wonderful.

1827
01:28:08,700 --> 01:28:12,220
That kind of simple intention can really
deep pollute your,

1828
01:28:12,390 --> 01:28:16,770
your subjective city that you've been 
sucking in shitty gas.

1829
01:28:16,770 --> 01:28:21,770
There was one time I saw that I was the 
only time I was looking for a guide to 

1830
01:28:21,770 --> 01:28:26,031
somebody,
but it was Willie Hunter was on him and 

1831
01:28:26,031 --> 01:28:27,921
he was shitting on following.
He was shitting on some like comic who 

1832
01:28:27,921 --> 01:28:27,921
would become like a vine star,
you know,

1833
01:28:27,921 --> 01:28:29,700
she was a shitty comment,
but it became like a and he was like,

1834
01:28:29,780 --> 01:28:30,530
I hate falling.
We're like,

1835
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:32,760
just for fun.
There's six second videos.

1836
01:28:32,761 --> 01:28:33,210
I was like,
no,

1837
01:28:33,211 --> 01:28:34,110
I hate him.
Like,

1838
01:28:34,111 --> 01:28:35,780
what about a six second youtube video?
Watch that.

1839
01:28:35,900 --> 01:28:36,860
I don't,
whatever.

1840
01:28:36,870 --> 01:28:38,820
He was just big,
shitty or like try to talk about it.

1841
01:28:38,821 --> 01:28:40,740
He wouldn't stop that.
We started with the mushrooms.

1842
01:28:40,750 --> 01:28:41,940
He was like,
I'm a bad person.

1843
01:28:43,200 --> 01:28:44,520
I never was like,
no,

1844
01:28:44,521 --> 01:28:45,270
no,
you're fine.

1845
01:28:45,300 --> 01:28:46,740
And he kept doing it and eventually I 
was like,

1846
01:28:46,850 --> 01:28:47,490
really?
Listen,

1847
01:28:48,450 --> 01:28:49,830
you're right.
That was you.

1848
01:28:49,831 --> 01:28:52,440
Being a bad person was like,
I'm so sorry.

1849
01:28:52,460 --> 01:28:57,460
There was like,
it's okay because here's the deal from 

1850
01:28:57,460 --> 01:28:57,460
now on,
you don't have to be that anymore.

1851
01:28:57,460 --> 01:28:59,220
You can just let that go and let people 
talk,

1852
01:28:59,221 --> 01:29:00,880
and he's like,
yeah,

1853
01:29:01,460 --> 01:29:06,460
yeah,
that's what it shows you like you can 

1854
01:29:06,460 --> 01:29:08,301
change,
but that thing you're talking about 

1855
01:29:08,301 --> 01:29:08,301
where you realize,
shit,

1856
01:29:08,301 --> 01:29:09,300
I'm a bad person.
That is there is,

1857
01:29:09,301 --> 01:29:10,530
I can't remember.
Name and Buddhism.

1858
01:29:10,531 --> 01:29:15,531
There's an actual name for that and it's
considered to be a very sweet moment 

1859
01:29:15,531 --> 01:29:19,310
where you need that moment.
It's virtualizer where you need that 

1860
01:29:19,310 --> 01:29:23,001
moment where you look at your life and 
you feel this very specific kind of 

1861
01:29:23,131 --> 01:29:28,131
sadness because you look at all the 
times you could have been kinder all the

1862
01:29:28,351 --> 01:29:33,351
times.
You could have called that person back 

1863
01:29:33,351 --> 01:29:35,780
all the time.
You could have made decisions that were 

1864
01:29:35,780 --> 01:29:38,630
pushing your boat in the direction of a 
better world and you didn't do it and 

1865
01:29:38,630 --> 01:29:43,011
you should feel sad about that,
but you shouldn't spend your whole life 

1866
01:29:43,011 --> 01:29:43,011
feeling sad about it.
Right?

1867
01:29:43,011 --> 01:29:45,210
You should just spend some time there 
and look at it and think,

1868
01:29:45,480 --> 01:29:47,400
okay,
well that's gone.

1869
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:52,410
The past has been devoured by time.
There's only this moment now and so from

1870
01:29:52,411 --> 01:29:54,570
this point forward,
as much as I can,

1871
01:29:54,810 --> 01:29:59,810
my decisions are going to be based on 
reducing the suffering of my species and

1872
01:30:00,750 --> 01:30:05,750
that means your trash before doesn't 
mean you have to let her keep going 

1873
01:30:05,750 --> 01:30:05,750
forever.

1874
01:30:05,750 --> 01:30:05,880
Yeah,
yeah,

1875
01:30:07,370 --> 01:30:08,180
yeah.
The,

1876
01:30:08,181 --> 01:30:13,181
the path of,
of trying to figure out like what's the 

1877
01:30:13,181 --> 01:30:16,400
best way in life is obscured by law and 
going amazing.

1878
01:30:16,430 --> 01:30:21,430
Like there's laws that they've created 
that make the best tools to find out who

1879
01:30:22,071 --> 01:30:25,670
you really are illegal.
That's like there's not a therapy in the

1880
01:30:25,671 --> 01:30:29,390
fucking world that will get a crazy 
sociopathic ego,

1881
01:30:29,391 --> 01:30:32,690
maniacal person to really look at 
themselves like a bag of mushrooms.

1882
01:30:32,691 --> 01:30:33,490
Well,
there's nothing,

1883
01:30:33,890 --> 01:30:36,320
nothing.
All those moments in film with like,

1884
01:30:36,520 --> 01:30:39,020
Oh,
I realize now that's all bullshit.

1885
01:30:39,640 --> 01:30:44,640
Creating a mushroom trip.
People that you know that are 

1886
01:30:44,640 --> 01:30:44,640
untrustworthy,
that you can't.

1887
01:30:44,640 --> 01:30:45,170
You can't.
Like,

1888
01:30:45,950 --> 01:30:48,230
you can't trust their stories.
You can't trust.

1889
01:30:48,360 --> 01:30:53,360
They're like,
those are the people that we all agree 

1890
01:30:53,360 --> 01:30:56,830
could have like the best experience on 
psychedelics because it'll give them 

1891
01:30:56,830 --> 01:31:00,761
like the best view of themselves,
but those are the same type of people 

1892
01:31:00,761 --> 01:31:01,220
that are going to argue against it.

1893
01:31:01,220 --> 01:31:06,220
Like if you ever talked to people that 
don't want mushrooms to be legal or 

1894
01:31:06,220 --> 01:31:06,220
don't want like,
oh,

1895
01:31:06,220 --> 01:31:07,630
but fuck that.
You think that should be.

1896
01:31:07,870 --> 01:31:12,870
You'll lose your fucking mind.
What about people who have lost her 

1897
01:31:12,870 --> 01:31:12,870
fucking model now?
It's like what?

1898
01:31:12,870 --> 01:31:14,180
People have lost their mind.
What are you talking about?

1899
01:31:14,270 --> 01:31:17,180
Those 14?
There's been some people that have blown

1900
01:31:17,181 --> 01:31:20,420
their brains out with LSD for sure.
There's definitely been some people that

1901
01:31:20,421 --> 01:31:25,421
had some psychotic episodes and it can 
be argued that a lot of those are 

1902
01:31:25,421 --> 01:31:27,170
psychotic episodes are people who are 
control freaks,

1903
01:31:27,171 --> 01:31:30,770
are egomaniacs that are struggling with 
the reality that's presented with them.

1904
01:31:31,310 --> 01:31:33,500
Present it to them that you shouldn't 
try it.

1905
01:31:33,501 --> 01:31:36,380
That's for sure.
People with a history of schizophrenia,

1906
01:31:36,410 --> 01:31:37,750
the family,
bipolar,

1907
01:31:38,910 --> 01:31:40,620
bipolar people,
they probably shouldn't try it either.

1908
01:31:40,621 --> 01:31:45,621
I mean,
there's probably a whole slew of people 

1909
01:31:45,621 --> 01:31:45,650
who have abnormal human chemistry.

1910
01:31:45,690 --> 01:31:46,800
You know what else?
Bipolar,

1911
01:31:46,801 --> 01:31:51,801
people shouldn't try.
Caffeine really shouldn't take caffeine 

1912
01:31:51,801 --> 01:31:51,801
pills.
Yeah,

1913
01:31:51,801 --> 01:31:53,250
you shouldn't do anything that's going 
to push you into a manic state.

1914
01:31:53,490 --> 01:31:55,920
It's like we can't consider,
you know,

1915
01:31:55,921 --> 01:31:56,580
it's like,
uh,

1916
01:31:56,780 --> 01:31:57,400
the,
the,

1917
01:31:57,410 --> 01:32:00,490
the victim thing about the victims of 
psychedelics,

1918
01:32:01,280 --> 01:32:03,370
you know,
and I know you think climbing up,

1919
01:32:03,550 --> 01:32:04,600
what is it?
That math?

1920
01:32:04,740 --> 01:32:06,130
Yeah,
I think it's ridiculous,

1921
01:32:06,131 --> 01:32:09,880
but there is a valley there called the.
I just read about this on Reddit,

1922
01:32:09,881 --> 01:32:11,350
I think it's called.
There's an area,

1923
01:32:11,351 --> 01:32:16,351
I think it's called the valley of 
rainbows and they call it that because 

1924
01:32:16,351 --> 01:32:19,960
of the brightly colored jackets on the 
corpses that are all laying there dead.

1925
01:32:20,190 --> 01:32:22,570
And I think psychedelics have the same 
kind of valley.

1926
01:32:22,750 --> 01:32:27,750
I think that there is an undeniable 
valley that must be filled with people 

1927
01:32:29,350 --> 01:32:34,350
who have been pushed into psychotic 
episodes or who are under the influence 

1928
01:32:34,421 --> 01:32:37,660
of a psychedelic made bad decisions,
car accidents,

1929
01:32:37,780 --> 01:32:40,990
all the things that come from 
irresponsibly using toxic.

1930
01:32:41,100 --> 01:32:46,100
You've got to admit that's real,
but just because that is real doesn't 

1931
01:32:46,100 --> 01:32:51,090
therefore exclude all the people who are
saying again and again and again and 

1932
01:32:51,731 --> 01:32:52,180
again.

1933
01:32:53,290 --> 01:32:56,500
Relationships are better,
so the marriages,

1934
01:32:56,540 --> 01:32:59,650
he even with alcohol or if there's some 
trump terms don't trump drawing,

1935
01:33:00,040 --> 01:33:05,040
but it's pretty fun to get fucked up 
with your friends once in a while you 

1936
01:33:05,040 --> 01:33:06,100
got to look at the whole picture,
look at the whole thing.

1937
01:33:06,130 --> 01:33:09,010
Don't deny the fact that they're 
dangerous chemicals and that people have

1938
01:33:09,011 --> 01:33:12,580
more than likely completely lost their 
shit because of them.

1939
01:33:12,581 --> 01:33:17,581
Don't deny that,
but then also don't deny the benefits 

1940
01:33:17,581 --> 01:33:21,331
and the same way with American sniper,
much better movie if that character was 

1941
01:33:21,551 --> 01:33:26,551
actually dealing with the fact that he's
blowing people away in a war that has 

1942
01:33:26,551 --> 01:33:28,690
been shown to be based on bad 
information.

1943
01:33:28,780 --> 01:33:32,170
You think that when you get to be as old
as clinics with us,

1944
01:33:32,590 --> 01:33:35,830
don't you think to you or your faculties
have been compromised?

1945
01:33:35,860 --> 01:33:36,150
Yeah,
yeah,

1946
01:33:36,151 --> 01:33:36,590
yeah,
yeah,

1947
01:33:36,591 --> 01:33:38,280
yeah.
It's almost 100 percent nothing thinking

1948
01:33:38,290 --> 01:33:39,820
the same way he was.

1949
01:33:39,820 --> 01:33:40,940
He's not as sharp.
No.

1950
01:33:40,980 --> 01:33:42,670
Honest million dollar baby was really 
good.

1951
01:33:43,030 --> 01:33:44,650
Yeah,
but this is not that.

1952
01:33:44,730 --> 01:33:49,730
It's also,
it's the subject matter that he's prone 

1953
01:33:49,730 --> 01:33:51,520
to go into these very right wing and 
also you probably get over.

1954
01:33:51,530 --> 01:33:56,530
You can't separate your feelings.
He didn't have any feeling about women 

1955
01:33:56,530 --> 01:33:56,980
boxers exactly.
Has deep feelings about this,

1956
01:33:56,981 --> 01:33:58,890
but it's got to be 100 percent raw Rah 
Rah,

1957
01:33:58,891 --> 01:33:59,770
and it's like,
all right man,

1958
01:33:59,771 --> 01:34:01,000
now you're not.
Even if you were younger,

1959
01:34:01,001 --> 01:34:02,070
you're still wouldn't be able to see 
this.

1960
01:34:02,170 --> 01:34:07,170
It's like when someone,
when someone talks like in their own 

1961
01:34:07,170 --> 01:34:07,510
words and you get to hear them talk in 
their own words,

1962
01:34:07,840 --> 01:34:09,850
you get a sense of like,
oh,

1963
01:34:09,851 --> 01:34:14,350
I see why you created this piece of art.
I see why this is your perspective.

1964
01:34:14,530 --> 01:34:17,500
And when you saw that the Republican 
national convention thing,

1965
01:34:17,501 --> 01:34:19,720
whatever the fuck it was when he was 
talking to Obama,

1966
01:34:19,960 --> 01:34:21,310
that's,
that's Clint Eastwood.

1967
01:34:21,460 --> 01:34:22,460
That was,
you know,

1968
01:34:22,540 --> 01:34:25,750
he.
So he's so fucking crazy that he thought

1969
01:34:25,751 --> 01:34:27,820
that up like on the spot.
That was ad libbed,

1970
01:34:28,210 --> 01:34:29,800
but you didn't even have anything 
planned out.

1971
01:34:29,960 --> 01:34:34,960
This fucking guy is giving this speech 
in front of this gigantic group of 

1972
01:34:34,960 --> 01:34:36,250
people.
He's so confident in his ideas.

1973
01:34:36,460 --> 01:34:41,260
Then he's going to ad Lib a conversation
with Obama complete with punchlines.

1974
01:34:41,560 --> 01:34:44,290
Oh yeah.
He comes from a non video world to where

1975
01:34:44,291 --> 01:34:44,900
he's like,
man.

1976
01:34:44,980 --> 01:34:49,980
So it was a group of a thousand people 
completely confident in his position in 

1977
01:34:50,771 --> 01:34:55,771
life and who he is and he's a movie star
has been a movie star for fucking 

1978
01:34:55,771 --> 01:34:55,771
100,000
years.

1979
01:34:56,230 --> 01:34:59,540
Everybody's been kissing his ass long 
before the Internet came along.

1980
01:35:00,020 --> 01:35:02,330
He's also a guy that agreed to do a 
fucking reality show.

1981
01:35:02,331 --> 01:35:05,180
Do you know that?
Where his wife was in a reality show.

1982
01:35:05,210 --> 01:35:07,510
His wife was in some crazy reality show,
man,

1983
01:35:07,530 --> 01:35:09,200
his wife,
I don't know if they're still together.

1984
01:35:09,201 --> 01:35:12,200
I think they might've got divorced,
but he wanted to be a star,

1985
01:35:12,201 --> 01:35:16,490
so she married when she was young and 
hot and then she did a reality show.

1986
01:35:17,200 --> 01:35:18,350
Well,
I didn't know it.

1987
01:35:18,860 --> 01:35:19,880
Yeah,
it didn't last.

1988
01:35:20,070 --> 01:35:22,520
I'm not sure if he's still with her.
Has No real,

1989
01:35:22,640 --> 01:35:25,100
real cool.
I will look at worth it.

1990
01:35:25,160 --> 01:35:30,160
I looked up an interview with Eastwood 
about directing the movie because I 

1991
01:35:30,160 --> 01:35:31,640
didn't understand how the guy at the 
Republican National Committee by this.

1992
01:35:32,150 --> 01:35:32,460
Oh,
well,

1993
01:35:32,480 --> 01:35:33,800
I mean I was just like,
Oh wow,

1994
01:35:33,801 --> 01:35:38,801
this is such blatant propaganda.
They're not even trying to make it 

1995
01:35:38,801 --> 01:35:38,801
subtle.
This is just like war,

1996
01:35:38,801 --> 01:35:40,100
war,
time movie out of it.

1997
01:35:40,160 --> 01:35:41,150
Yeah.
Yeah.

1998
01:35:41,210 --> 01:35:42,680
That I was curious like,
okay,

1999
01:35:42,681 --> 01:35:47,681
I wonder how involved eastwood was in 
directing this just based on what I saw 

2000
01:35:47,681 --> 01:35:49,400
at the Republican national convention.
Didn't know it was improvised.

2001
01:35:49,401 --> 01:35:54,401
So now that kind of explains it.
I thought maybe he was just suffering 

2002
01:35:54,401 --> 01:35:54,710
from senile dementia or something

2003
01:35:54,910 --> 01:35:58,450
called Mrs Eastwood and company.
It was on 2012.

2004
01:35:58,451 --> 01:36:00,970
It was a reality show.
So what the interview say though?

2005
01:36:01,250 --> 01:36:02,390
Well,
the interview was,

2006
01:36:02,540 --> 01:36:04,160
you know,
it was just him saying like,

2007
01:36:04,161 --> 01:36:07,610
he had actually been reading the book 
when they called and he said,

2008
01:36:08,090 --> 01:36:13,090
let me finish the book.
I've got 40 pages left and so I read it 

2009
01:36:13,090 --> 01:36:14,320
the next day and decided,
you know,

2010
01:36:14,330 --> 01:36:17,690
I was just a basic basic interview,
but I just,

2011
01:36:17,990 --> 01:36:20,230
it was just so appalled by that.

2012
01:36:20,560 --> 01:36:22,730
That was her.
It's pretty God damn hot that his wife,

2013
01:36:22,790 --> 01:36:27,790
it was his wife divorced him.
Of course he would marry a super hot 

2014
01:36:27,790 --> 01:36:27,790
person.
She's hot as fuck.

2015
01:36:27,790 --> 01:36:31,930
Should compounds a wowza son.
Yeah.

2016
01:36:32,560 --> 01:36:37,220
Movie Star Yachty is what each expect.
Yeah.

2017
01:36:37,221 --> 01:36:39,910
You can't really say.
You also have some that.

2018
01:36:40,070 --> 01:36:45,070
Oh yeah.
I also have a story that's out on 

2019
01:36:45,070 --> 01:36:45,070
youtube now.
My first story,

2020
01:36:45,070 --> 01:36:45,560
they put it out.
Beautiful smuggling we did in Australia.

2021
01:36:45,740 --> 01:36:46,660
Oh Shit.
Cool.

2022
01:36:46,850 --> 01:36:49,100
Don't talk about that on online.
What are you doing?

2023
01:36:49,190 --> 01:36:52,680
The beginning of it,
I should say,

2024
01:36:52,681 --> 01:36:55,830
this is all a lie you just got done 
talking about.

2025
01:36:55,840 --> 01:36:58,450
Truthfully,
you should be our reality.

2026
01:36:58,490 --> 01:37:00,830
I don't do it anymore because the 
results of this story,

2027
01:37:01,520 --> 01:37:05,480
but even then you could be like 
admitting to an Interpol related crime.

2028
01:37:05,900 --> 01:37:10,900
I don't find any of that.
You're going to fucking have every bag 

2029
01:37:10,900 --> 01:37:13,631
of garbage time and they have them like 
locked up by date labeled so that if you

2030
01:37:15,561 --> 01:37:20,561
talk about something,
they can go back to the house and they 

2031
01:37:20,561 --> 01:37:20,561
go,
we found it.

2032
01:37:20,561 --> 01:37:20,870
We found the bag.
We got the rappers,

2033
01:37:21,020 --> 01:37:24,350
best fucking kids on the pot and that 
you brought those.

2034
01:37:24,351 --> 01:37:27,740
They'll find your DNA from the rapper,
from your sweat though,

2035
01:37:27,741 --> 01:37:32,741
isolate it,
and they'll bring you up into some sort 

2036
01:37:32,741 --> 01:37:32,741
of tribunal.
The next time you try to go to Sydney.

2037
01:37:32,741 --> 01:37:34,940
Here's a little like care about that.
Just youtube search.

2038
01:37:34,941 --> 01:37:37,490
This is not happening already.
Smuggles weeding into Australia.

2039
01:37:37,530 --> 01:37:39,890
You can see it right now.
You are gangster sir.

2040
01:37:39,940 --> 01:37:42,460
You know man,
that makes me think it is a movie that's

2041
01:37:42,461 --> 01:37:43,930
coming out.
I'm really excited about.

2042
01:37:43,931 --> 01:37:48,931
Timothy leary's kid is releasing this 
movie about his dad and and and Richard 

2043
01:37:49,330 --> 01:37:54,330
Alpert,
but it's got all this like Bradley 

2044
01:37:54,330 --> 01:37:54,330
Cooper Place Timothy Leary.
I heard.

2045
01:37:54,330 --> 01:37:55,060
What's that documentary?
Oh,

2046
01:37:55,070 --> 01:37:55,860
I see.
I missed it.

2047
01:37:55,861 --> 01:37:56,160
God

2048
01:37:56,160 --> 01:37:56,850
Damn it.
Sorry.

2049
01:37:57,360 --> 01:38:02,360
Totally.
That's such a slow ball too and I just 

2050
01:38:02,360 --> 01:38:04,761
thought he was going to give you acid to
this kid and he wasn't going to.

2051
01:38:05,641 --> 01:38:08,340
But then the kid picked up a Bible so he
gave the kid acid.

2052
01:38:08,640 --> 01:38:13,640
Now this the real movies of this sniper 
moment,

2053
01:38:16,020 --> 01:38:18,060
the kid is about to pick up the Bible.
I can't do it.

2054
01:38:18,270 --> 01:38:23,270
Gets the eyedropper and squirts in the 
kid's mouth and you see the kids 

2055
01:38:23,270 --> 01:38:26,211
eyeballs dilate,
falls back into a kaleidoscope and 

2056
01:38:26,211 --> 01:38:30,760
Sufjan Jesus.
We hope you do to do something.

2057
01:38:36,031 --> 01:38:38,360
Probably worse.
Some of the more ridiculous than that.

2058
01:38:38,480 --> 01:38:40,510
What smart people will see through this.
Yeah.

2059
01:38:40,530 --> 01:38:42,000
That's not as watching this though.
Yeah.

2060
01:38:42,001 --> 01:38:44,280
Those sniper movies aren't really for 
smart people,

2061
01:38:44,310 --> 01:38:49,310
but it's cool to watch clinches.
Timothy leary at the Senate hearings 

2062
01:38:49,310 --> 01:38:49,310
apologized to my data.
Cool.

2063
01:38:49,310 --> 01:38:52,290
Watching him like having to talk to 
Senate about lsd.

2064
01:38:52,291 --> 01:38:53,750
It's bad ass.
So he just,

2065
01:38:53,820 --> 01:38:56,820
you apologize to your date while we were
talking.

2066
01:38:56,821 --> 01:38:57,410
I was like,
ah.

2067
01:38:57,460 --> 01:39:00,090
So I thought that'd be better.
Sorry.

2068
01:39:00,680 --> 01:39:02,020
Just a poor pick.
Um,

2069
01:39:02,021 --> 01:39:03,050
uh,
you get to pick the next one.

2070
01:39:03,870 --> 01:39:06,920
That's hilarious.
That's hilarious.

2071
01:39:07,570 --> 01:39:12,570
Um,
there's a lot of stories about this and 

2072
01:39:12,570 --> 01:39:12,570
I'm getting a shitload of tweets of 
people asking me,

2073
01:39:12,570 --> 01:39:15,320
like to substantiate.
But there's a lot of stories.

2074
01:39:15,321 --> 01:39:17,920
It's all over online.
What are the Himalayan?

2075
01:39:18,500 --> 01:39:19,360
Yeah,
the weld.

2076
01:39:19,370 --> 01:39:24,370
The concerns are,
I can't say I don't know who the fuck 

2077
01:39:24,370 --> 01:39:24,370
is.
Right.

2078
01:39:24,370 --> 01:39:24,370
And who's wrong?
I didn't do any research.

2079
01:39:24,370 --> 01:39:28,240
Clipped a jury to the jury,
decided that Ventura was right,

2080
01:39:28,750 --> 01:39:30,740
and then nothing else has been.
They owe him.

2081
01:39:30,880 --> 01:39:31,340
They,
oh,

2082
01:39:31,341 --> 01:39:34,070
I'm Jesse Ventura.
One point $8 million dollars.

2083
01:39:34,071 --> 01:39:37,190
Apparently one point eight,
one point 9 million.

2084
01:39:37,710 --> 01:39:40,600
Say one point seven,
one point seven feet with the fight.

2085
01:39:40,640 --> 01:39:45,410
So it's also crazy that that's how it's 
never like one point eight,

2086
01:39:45,411 --> 01:39:45,890
one,
three,

2087
01:39:45,891 --> 01:39:46,880
seven,
4 million.

2088
01:39:47,180 --> 01:39:49,070
Like it's not exact amount is the pain.

2089
01:39:49,100 --> 01:39:54,100
How do they come up with it?
That narrowed it down to the close 

2090
01:39:54,100 --> 01:39:54,100
800,000.
That's so weird.

2091
01:39:54,100 --> 01:39:55,550
Thousand to weird thing,
man,

2092
01:39:55,551 --> 01:40:00,551
to make a movie about a guy who might 
have been a liar and put those lines in 

2093
01:40:01,581 --> 01:40:03,230
a movie.
And that gets all miracle.

2094
01:40:03,240 --> 01:40:05,490
All frothy.
I mean,

2095
01:40:05,840 --> 01:40:06,980
well that means that,
you know what that means?

2096
01:40:06,981 --> 01:40:08,780
That means another fucking attacks 
coming.

2097
01:40:09,410 --> 01:40:14,410
Does that what it means?
So we had to get salt orchestrated 

2098
01:40:14,410 --> 01:40:14,410
because we've got to get people ready to
join up.

2099
01:40:14,410 --> 01:40:18,850
I don't think it's better than a draft.
I guess if you got to pick between that 

2100
01:40:18,850 --> 01:40:20,720
draft and a,
uh,

2101
01:40:22,190 --> 01:40:25,370
that means for like ridiculous 
propaganda movies coming out every year.

2102
01:40:25,520 --> 01:40:28,600
You know what I think?
I think you shouldn't have no wars.

2103
01:40:29,030 --> 01:40:31,280
We should fight no wars with anyone 
under 50.

2104
01:40:32,030 --> 01:40:35,150
I think everybody who goes to war should
be over 50 lps.

2105
01:40:35,440 --> 01:40:40,440
Let's see.
Let's see how quick we fucking settle 

2106
01:40:40,440 --> 01:40:40,440
this thing.
I bet it would be pretty God damn quick.

2107
01:40:40,440 --> 01:40:44,380
Oh,
a bunch of old people that just don't 

2108
01:40:44,380 --> 01:40:44,380
want any trouble.
I mean he was like,

2109
01:40:44,380 --> 01:40:48,190
how can we,
is there a way to solve this without 

2110
01:40:48,190 --> 01:40:48,190
shooting them?
It's like those feet on the ground.

2111
01:40:48,190 --> 01:40:48,190
He was coming at me and it's like,
okay,

2112
01:40:48,190 --> 01:40:53,051
but shooting him to death is the only 
way to stop a guy because you think 

2113
01:40:53,051 --> 01:40:54,070
about the consequences of the decisions 
or think

2114
01:40:54,070 --> 01:40:59,070
about the consequences of a decision to 
fly in a plane to a place where you've 

2115
01:40:59,070 --> 01:41:02,281
never been and shoot someone he never 
known based on the directions by some 

2116
01:41:02,281 --> 01:41:04,870
people who you don't know.
We're making you march.

2117
01:41:05,110 --> 01:41:06,260
They're making you go,
shoo.

2118
01:41:06,340 --> 01:41:07,150
Shoo.
Shoo.

2119
01:41:07,280 --> 01:41:12,280
Shoo.
They're making you do all this shit 

2120
01:41:12,280 --> 01:41:13,180
preparing you for.
You have to listen to them.

2121
01:41:13,240 --> 01:41:18,240
Unquestionably known.
Imagine that with 50 year old.

2122
01:41:19,270 --> 01:41:21,170
Yeah,
never going to happen.

2123
01:41:22,130 --> 01:41:23,420
We're going to go wait a minute.
Wait and why?

2124
01:41:23,421 --> 01:41:24,540
We're shooting these guys winning and 
winning.

2125
01:41:24,550 --> 01:41:25,540
We're breaking down.
What door?

2126
01:41:25,570 --> 01:41:27,430
Who the fuck are you?
Who the fuck are you?

2127
01:41:27,431 --> 01:41:29,380
And where'd you go to school?
What's your degree in?

2128
01:41:29,500 --> 01:41:31,300
And you're going to tell me about 
international politics.

2129
01:41:31,301 --> 01:41:36,301
Do you even know these fucking Sunni's?
What's the difference between the Sunni 

2130
01:41:36,301 --> 01:41:36,301
and Shia?
Sir?

2131
01:41:36,301 --> 01:41:36,301
Tell me what the difference is.
Do you know?

2132
01:41:36,370 --> 01:41:37,900
Do you know why these people were at war
with each other?

2133
01:41:37,901 --> 01:41:39,850
Do you know why they hate each other?
Do you know how to hate us?

2134
01:41:39,940 --> 01:41:42,580
Do you know this is Holy Land.
Do you know how long this has been?

2135
01:41:42,581 --> 01:41:44,360
Holy Land.
Do you know when they're in?

2136
01:41:44,660 --> 01:41:47,830
If you had a group of 50 year old people
there and slug it.

2137
01:41:49,610 --> 01:41:51,610
I'm talking to you.
Oh,

2138
01:41:51,611 --> 01:41:53,080
you're allowed.
So I have to listen.

2139
01:41:53,230 --> 01:41:55,670
Is that what's going on?
Oh,

2140
01:41:55,960 --> 01:42:00,960
you don't have anything to say,
but you're going to get my face in spit 

2141
01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:02,430
is that gonna make me intimidated and so
I'll listen,

2142
01:42:02,500 --> 01:42:04,750
so I'll just go and kill some people 
that you say are bad.

2143
01:42:05,350 --> 01:42:10,350
If we did that,
if we just had only 50 year olds and 

2144
01:42:10,350 --> 01:42:11,020
above go to war,
the whole fucking thing would change.

2145
01:42:11,440 --> 01:42:16,440
The whole thing.
It's just it's easy to send fucking 

2146
01:42:16,440 --> 01:42:16,440
kids.

2147
01:42:16,440 --> 01:42:17,770
They don't know any better detail.
Your cerebral cortex,

2148
01:42:17,771 --> 01:42:20,560
your frontal lobe.
They're saying like for young males,

2149
01:42:20,561 --> 01:42:25,561
especially because fucking influx,
the rowdy or not making rational 

2150
01:42:26,291 --> 01:42:28,240
decisions like when you're a 16 year old
kid,

2151
01:42:28,360 --> 01:42:31,210
your balls are filled with testosterone.
There's a completely new experience.

2152
01:42:31,360 --> 01:42:33,100
By the time you've got to be 40 years 
old,

2153
01:42:33,250 --> 01:42:35,440
you've had a lifetime of wanting to 
come.

2154
01:42:35,590 --> 01:42:39,280
A lifetime of like knowing what that is 
and knowing how to mitigate it.

2155
01:42:39,450 --> 01:42:41,620
When you're 17,
18,

2156
01:42:41,800 --> 01:42:44,500
you don't know what the fuck is 
happening to your body.

2157
01:42:44,650 --> 01:42:49,650
You add into that masturbation guilt 
like people who were actually avoiding 

2158
01:42:49,650 --> 01:42:51,340
masturbation.
Most of us don't,

2159
01:42:51,550 --> 01:42:56,120
but there are some who so they try it as
little as top of the white gloves on the

2160
01:42:56,510 --> 01:43:01,510
guns when they get comments,
when they put Megan where a white glove 

2161
01:43:01,510 --> 01:43:04,350
around something.
Wasn't that a thing with white gloves 

2162
01:43:04,350 --> 01:43:07,291
and someone who's not matched with that 
going to blow this shit.

2163
01:43:08,620 --> 01:43:12,760
Every fucking one of those gopros under 
over your bunk and if they don't see you

2164
01:43:12,761 --> 01:43:15,310
beaten off under the sheets,
I can fucking asked you questions.

2165
01:43:15,560 --> 01:43:20,560
Doctor,
do you want to come in here and talk to 

2166
01:43:20,560 --> 01:43:20,560
us real quick?
You got anything on your mind like maybe

2167
01:43:20,560 --> 01:43:23,710
putting pussy or booties or something on
your mind.

2168
01:43:23,711 --> 01:43:28,711
You're trying to keep boys as social.
I'm just thinking about killing right 

2169
01:43:28,711 --> 01:43:33,480
now was Duncan.
This is not the type of soldier will 

2170
01:43:33,480 --> 01:43:33,480
good for and this here,
army,

2171
01:43:33,480 --> 01:43:37,741
we want well balanced individuals that 
make rational choices based on the 

2172
01:43:37,741 --> 01:43:38,290
evidence at hand,
not based on lust,

2173
01:43:38,560 --> 01:43:40,750
not based on a ball full of cum.
Just waiting.

2174
01:43:40,751 --> 01:43:45,040
A fucking g is all over some new part of
the world to spread your fucking seed.

2175
01:43:45,130 --> 01:43:50,130
My gun is my cock bullets.
Serum Ige is and the brains of my job

2176
01:43:52,400 --> 01:43:57,190
are my pussy.
Oh my God.

2177
01:43:57,220 --> 01:44:02,220
And best moving to either go jim's dead 
bro Bro Bro,

2178
01:44:08,030 --> 01:44:13,030
when you get up and leave,
but like are you going to call me on 

2179
01:44:13,030 --> 01:44:14,690
American if I just think the filmmaking 
of this as bad.

2180
01:44:15,050 --> 01:44:17,090
Manipulative.
It is like you want to walk out,

2181
01:44:17,091 --> 01:44:19,390
but simultaneously you feel like you're 
being.

2182
01:44:19,670 --> 01:44:23,260
You want to go to 18 on this.
This is kind of done this in an hour.

2183
01:44:23,330 --> 01:44:27,040
I our 26 to 18

2184
01:44:27,900 --> 01:44:32,900
embarrassing.
If this turns out that this guy really 

2185
01:44:32,900 --> 01:44:35,121
did make up all this shit because 
there's another article I'm looking at 

2186
01:44:35,121 --> 01:44:37,200
right now about the criticism of the 
Post Katrina in New Orleans story.

2187
01:44:37,201 --> 01:44:40,470
Like how it's all total horseshit.
How they can prove it tore shit cause he

2188
01:44:40,471 --> 01:44:42,750
wasn't even there at that time.
Oh yeah.

2189
01:44:42,880 --> 01:44:46,440
It's like there's a lot of horseshit.
You mean there's,

2190
01:44:46,470 --> 01:44:51,470
there's,
there's facebook and in the movie it's 

2191
01:44:51,470 --> 01:44:53,121
all.
He's just trying to downplay all of his 

2192
01:44:53,121 --> 01:44:54,681
legend even though he's now.
It's like he's the one who was saying 

2193
01:44:54,681 --> 01:44:54,681
it.
Don't fall for this if you're wrong,

2194
01:44:54,681 --> 01:44:55,430
good luck.
Good luck her.

2195
01:44:55,640 --> 01:44:57,180
I'm not supposed to.
I'm not going to do out here,

2196
01:44:57,181 --> 01:44:58,530
but for all of you,
for it,

2197
01:44:59,200 --> 01:45:00,390
they'll fry you,
put you in life.

2198
01:45:00,400 --> 01:45:02,300
And why aren't you looking at the 
spotter?

2199
01:45:02,310 --> 01:45:05,010
Look,
you an Iud.

2200
01:45:05,810 --> 01:45:10,810
Will you just crouching behind a wall?
I just fucking up his shot looking at 

2201
01:45:10,810 --> 01:45:15,620
extra pressure on this.
There's a facebook page not endorsing 

2202
01:45:15,620 --> 01:45:16,410
this.
I'm just letting you know this dedicated

2203
01:45:16,411 --> 01:45:20,540
entirely to the subject and it's Chris.
Kyle was a murderous liar.

2204
01:45:20,740 --> 01:45:25,740
It's a community on facebook and it's 
all a bunch of different posts saying 

2205
01:45:26,311 --> 01:45:27,160
that,
you know,

2206
01:45:27,360 --> 01:45:30,150
saying how much it was bullshit.
This is crazy,

2207
01:45:30,151 --> 01:45:30,480
man.

2208
01:45:32,720 --> 01:45:34,340
Yeah,
I guess people don't want to.

2209
01:45:34,760 --> 01:45:39,090
It's really hard for people to digest 
the simple fact that Pete,

2210
01:45:39,230 --> 01:45:42,630
that war makes a lot of money for a 
small amount of people.

2211
01:45:42,631 --> 01:45:45,270
It's a profitable endeavor.
And uh,

2212
01:45:45,740 --> 01:45:48,590
if you want to make money in that 
industry,

2213
01:45:48,591 --> 01:45:53,220
then you've got to convince heroes 
because that is the heroic ends.

2214
01:45:53,270 --> 01:45:58,270
It's a really sweet mpulse the idea that
I will give my life for you to protect 

2215
01:45:59,151 --> 01:46:00,550
you,
to protect people.

2216
01:46:00,560 --> 01:46:05,560
I don't know.
That's the one of the highest human 

2217
01:46:05,560 --> 01:46:05,560
aspirations.
It's like an incredible thing,

2218
01:46:05,690 --> 01:46:10,690
but so you take those people who have 
this incredible aspiration to give their

2219
01:46:11,001 --> 01:46:16,001
life to protect people and you lie to 
them and brainwash them and send them to

2220
01:46:16,851 --> 01:46:21,851
a place to kill people based on this 
very incredible thing and leave the nfl 

2221
01:46:22,640 --> 01:46:24,500
and fucking give us.
And by the way,

2222
01:46:24,530 --> 01:46:26,540
well no,
Pat Tillman did it on his own.

2223
01:46:28,220 --> 01:46:33,220
We need you to do this.
But Pat Tillman was a huge critic once 

2224
01:46:33,220 --> 01:46:33,220
he got over there,
the,

2225
01:46:33,220 --> 01:46:38,071
you know,
he was killed by friendly fire and 

2226
01:46:38,071 --> 01:46:38,071
there's many people that have speculated
they murdered him,

2227
01:46:38,071 --> 01:46:38,840
that murdered him because he wouldn't 
shut the fuck up.

2228
01:46:39,490 --> 01:46:42,320
Organize.
Everything was about what a dog and pony

2229
01:46:42,321 --> 01:46:44,510
show and everything was fucked up.
The people that are to listen to,

2230
01:46:44,520 --> 01:46:46,070
we're all assholes.
Who was like,

2231
01:46:46,071 --> 01:46:48,650
this is crazy.
Like this is not what I signed up for.

2232
01:46:48,651 --> 01:46:50,070
This is not what I wanted to

2233
01:46:50,110 --> 01:46:55,110
be in total chaos,
which led to this fucking crossfire 

2234
01:46:55,110 --> 01:46:58,281
situation.
It killed fucking talent to stop 

2235
01:46:58,281 --> 01:46:58,940
shooting and then they shot him.
They shot his whole troop up.

2236
01:46:58,950 --> 01:46:59,880
Though,
I mean,

2237
01:46:59,910 --> 01:47:02,040
look,
when you start shooting things,

2238
01:47:02,041 --> 01:47:07,041
that's the other thing.
It'd become target and then say we've 

2239
01:47:07,041 --> 01:47:07,200
become targets.
They don't comment on drone mistakes.

2240
01:47:07,290 --> 01:47:08,750
They don't comment on the times when 
it's.

2241
01:47:08,751 --> 01:47:10,770
It blows up a fucking wedding 
convention,

2242
01:47:10,771 --> 01:47:13,530
which is most of the time that's why 
there's more mistake,

2243
01:47:13,531 --> 01:47:15,780
the innocence and that our policy is not
the comment on that.

2244
01:47:15,781 --> 01:47:16,380
Like,
wait,

2245
01:47:16,381 --> 01:47:18,090
why is that an allowable policy?
Yeah,

2246
01:47:18,091 --> 01:47:23,091
the percentage is terrifying.
If you look at the percentage of people 

2247
01:47:23,091 --> 01:47:24,420
that are actually killed by drones that 
are their intended targets,

2248
01:47:24,720 --> 01:47:26,130
it's terrible.
It shouldn't be terrorists,

2249
01:47:26,160 --> 01:47:29,310
but they're not surgical strikes.
How close is it?

2250
01:47:29,340 --> 01:47:34,340
You're not.
It's not a scalpel on the end of a 

2251
01:47:34,340 --> 01:47:34,340
fishing pole,
you know?

2252
01:47:34,340 --> 01:47:36,330
It's just the idea that surgical is 
retarded.

2253
01:47:36,360 --> 01:47:41,360
If we had drones going overhead and then
I found out who's responsible for it 

2254
01:47:41,360 --> 01:47:41,360
yet,
and I'm a little kid,

2255
01:47:41,370 --> 01:47:46,370
I'm like,
this is fucking Yemen drone that's over 

2256
01:47:46,370 --> 01:47:46,370
here.
Killed my kids.

2257
01:47:46,370 --> 01:47:46,370
Like,
Goddamn right,

2258
01:47:46,370 --> 01:47:48,870
I'm going to want attack Yemen.
Stop fucking set of that shit over here.

2259
01:47:49,220 --> 01:47:50,620
It killed my father.
Yeah.

2260
01:47:50,670 --> 01:47:51,660
Well,
not only that,

2261
01:47:51,661 --> 01:47:54,960
but why wouldn't they want to know?
If you look at the,

2262
01:47:54,990 --> 01:47:58,110
like we were talking earlier about what 
you were saying about this,

2263
01:47:58,220 --> 01:48:03,220
these invading armies in Iraq and the 
other people that have ptsd and the 

2264
01:48:03,220 --> 01:48:07,761
birth defects.
You've got to go way back to the 

2265
01:48:07,761 --> 01:48:08,640
original Gulf War.
They were using fucking depleted uranium

2266
01:48:08,641 --> 01:48:13,641
and everybody forgets about this.
Everybody completely sweep this under 

2267
01:48:13,641 --> 01:48:13,641
the rug.
It was proven.

2268
01:48:13,740 --> 01:48:17,550
They use depleted uranium shells that 
blew right through fucking tanks.

2269
01:48:17,700 --> 01:48:22,700
This incredibly dense nuclear waste that
poisons everything around it for 100,000

2270
01:48:23,551 --> 01:48:28,551
years and that was 25 years ago.
We're expecting those 15 year olds who 

2271
01:48:28,551 --> 01:48:29,570
were the 40 year olds now to go,
oh well I don't care anymore.

2272
01:48:29,580 --> 01:48:32,790
No big deal,
but not just forget about that time.

2273
01:48:32,791 --> 01:48:34,520
You killed my entire family.
Oh,

2274
01:48:34,530 --> 01:48:39,530
and you're right here.
Someone representing your governments 

2275
01:48:39,530 --> 01:48:39,530
right here.
Totally cool,

2276
01:48:39,530 --> 01:48:40,230
but it's something that we're not 
supposed to talk about.

2277
01:48:40,231 --> 01:48:43,230
Just like the ideologies that we just 
discussed earlier,

2278
01:48:43,231 --> 01:48:45,500
just like religion,
it falls into a religion.

2279
01:48:45,530 --> 01:48:47,700
Got To talk about Elysium falls into a 
religion.

2280
01:48:47,701 --> 01:48:51,810
Don't all start talking about it,
but you can't talk about it.

2281
01:48:51,930 --> 01:48:56,930
Well,
it's also because there are bad people 

2282
01:48:56,930 --> 01:48:59,091
keep talking about the weed.
It's like that's why it's all lead 

2283
01:48:59,091 --> 01:48:59,091
because I've got another deal,
right?

2284
01:48:59,091 --> 01:49:01,770
Everyone talks about becomes normalized.
You got to just talk about it all time.

2285
01:49:01,800 --> 01:49:06,800
Exactly.
You're friends with whatever and it 

2286
01:49:06,800 --> 01:49:06,800
doesn't mean that you're done.
This is where people get confused.

2287
01:49:06,800 --> 01:49:11,681
It doesn't mean that there aren't heroes
and doesn't mean you don't need a 

2288
01:49:11,681 --> 01:49:14,181
defense.
You don't need to be able to protect 

2289
01:49:14,181 --> 01:49:14,181
yourself from some fucking North Korean 
asshole.

2290
01:49:14,181 --> 01:49:16,320
That guy decides to start taking over 
the world.

2291
01:49:16,321 --> 01:49:21,321
Like what if they had massive resources.
We're lucky they're in a resource 

2292
01:49:21,321 --> 01:49:23,160
starved environment,
so you have this communist dictator with

2293
01:49:23,161 --> 01:49:28,161
nuclear weapons that a resource starved 
environment where they have to shut the 

2294
01:49:28,161 --> 01:49:28,560
lights off at night because they can't 
afford to keep them on,

2295
01:49:28,800 --> 01:49:33,800
but if that guy had oil or gold or 
something crazy and like Saudi Arabia 

2296
01:49:33,961 --> 01:49:38,961
type money,
if like one of those guys became some 

2297
01:49:38,961 --> 01:49:39,390
sort of a fucking world spreading 
villain,

2298
01:49:39,540 --> 01:49:44,540
you need heroes.
You need real soldiers that are willing 

2299
01:49:44,540 --> 01:49:46,750
to fight against bad people.
That's what happened in World War Two,

2300
01:49:47,500 --> 01:49:49,370
World War II when you had the Nazis and 
all that.

2301
01:49:49,370 --> 01:49:51,310
I mean,
I'm sure there's all sorts of flexes.

2302
01:49:51,510 --> 01:49:53,350
They use the justified war,
uh,

2303
01:49:53,360 --> 01:49:57,790
argument as proof to get us into sort of
less way less justified war.

2304
01:49:58,710 --> 01:50:02,200
We're sending them to the best thing to 
happen to the US army.

2305
01:50:02,330 --> 01:50:03,430
When we're saying,
look,

2306
01:50:03,490 --> 01:50:06,160
now we can do anything.
We just say we're doing the right thing.

2307
01:50:06,310 --> 01:50:11,310
Exactly what is exactly the same thing 
we were saying about religion is that 

2308
01:50:11,310 --> 01:50:14,590
it's not that these people are bad 
people and it's not that God is bad.

2309
01:50:14,740 --> 01:50:17,380
No one's saying that.
But what we're saying is like,

2310
01:50:17,381 --> 01:50:21,640
look what's being done in the name of 
this and look how there's no thinking.

2311
01:50:22,060 --> 01:50:24,670
Whenever there's no thinking and 
horrific acts are being done,

2312
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:30,000
there's no thing.
If you're ever in a situation where a 

2313
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:30,000
fucking little kid has a rocket 
launcher,

2314
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:31,150
everybody should stop what they're 
doing.

2315
01:50:31,330 --> 01:50:34,800
Get the fuck out of there and try to 
figure out a how.

2316
01:50:35,210 --> 01:50:37,240
How did this happen?
Or B,

2317
01:50:37,330 --> 01:50:39,370
how do you fix it and the way you don't 
fix this,

2318
01:50:39,371 --> 01:50:44,371
but shooting kids that doesn't fix shit 
that just like the mother is doing now.

2319
01:50:45,520 --> 01:50:50,520
Oakland PD is starting up like Youth 
Basketball Leagues and they're coaching 

2320
01:50:50,520 --> 01:50:51,820
and stuff to so the youth grow up.
Not going fuck the police,

2321
01:50:51,821 --> 01:50:52,190
but like,
no,

2322
01:50:52,210 --> 01:50:53,650
the police were cool there.
Help sell it and stuff.

2323
01:50:53,710 --> 01:50:55,510
That's like,
you can't solve it right now,

2324
01:50:55,511 --> 01:50:58,150
but 20 years from now it'll be better 
than it is now.

2325
01:50:58,210 --> 01:51:03,210
Will also.
What's happened in New York when they 

2326
01:51:03,210 --> 01:51:04,420
did the police slow down where they just
wouldn't arrest anybody for anything.

2327
01:51:04,421 --> 01:51:05,560
After those two kids got,
oh,

2328
01:51:05,561 --> 01:51:08,200
there's two cops got shocked by that one
guy,

2329
01:51:08,920 --> 01:51:12,070
that one guy who by the way also shot 
his fucking ex girlfriend,

2330
01:51:12,071 --> 01:51:16,150
like the guy was a piece of shit to 
people to think he's a hero.

2331
01:51:16,510 --> 01:51:19,570
Like Jesus Christ.
He shot his girlfriend first and then he

2332
01:51:19,571 --> 01:51:22,780
went and shot those cops.
He was a psychotic murderous person,

2333
01:51:23,050 --> 01:51:27,640
but because of that act,
the cops backed up.

2334
01:51:27,700 --> 01:51:31,120
The cups finally started.
Stopped fucking with people they need to

2335
01:51:31,121 --> 01:51:33,130
stay where they're at right there.
Yeah,

2336
01:51:33,131 --> 01:51:33,660
exactly.
What?

2337
01:51:33,661 --> 01:51:35,780
Where they are right there.
Cameras.

2338
01:51:35,870 --> 01:51:40,870
Are you finding this camera's not saying
that they should be scared all the time 

2339
01:51:40,870 --> 01:51:43,711
of being murdered,
but I'm saying the attitude that they 

2340
01:51:43,711 --> 01:51:43,711
devote like,
okay,

2341
01:51:43,711 --> 01:51:43,711
we're not going to arrest anybody for 
anything.

2342
01:51:43,711 --> 01:51:48,211
That's not important.
That's all you should have ever been 

2343
01:51:48,211 --> 01:51:48,211
doing.
Exactly.

2344
01:51:48,260 --> 01:51:50,530
New Collector.
It's illegal to sell cigarettes outside,

2345
01:51:50,531 --> 01:51:53,500
so tell them to get lost or don't.
You'll shake them down.

2346
01:51:53,950 --> 01:51:57,850
How about you hire a fucking lawyer to 
go sue that guy and then you find out he

2347
01:51:57,851 --> 01:51:59,230
doesn't have any money.
He's not gonna pay anyway.

2348
01:51:59,350 --> 01:52:02,260
There's your problem.
You got a problem with tax collecting.

2349
01:52:02,380 --> 01:52:04,120
You don't have a pr.
If that guy rob somebody,

2350
01:52:04,240 --> 01:52:09,240
then you bring it up,
Jay walking and he comes in and he 

2351
01:52:09,240 --> 01:52:09,240
breaks into your house and steals your 
TV.

2352
01:52:09,240 --> 01:52:10,810
Then you have the cops,
but anything,

2353
01:52:10,900 --> 01:52:13,360
any use of that other than protecting 
people.

2354
01:52:13,630 --> 01:52:17,500
Fucking choking a guy because he's not 
paying cigarette tax.

2355
01:52:17,950 --> 01:52:22,950
What the fuck are the cops?
It's not like New York plunged into 

2356
01:52:22,950 --> 01:52:23,320
chaos,
but as they started enforcing,

2357
01:52:24,160 --> 01:52:26,680
write him a ticket.
You don't much nicer.

2358
01:52:26,690 --> 01:52:30,430
The world would be if cops only acted in
that slow down manner,

2359
01:52:30,460 --> 01:52:32,100
but they don't act like that with big 
black man.

2360
01:52:32,101 --> 01:52:34,510
There's a huge racism.
It would be incredible.

2361
01:52:34,511 --> 01:52:37,390
Don't act though where you've been there
over the last few months.

2362
01:52:37,420 --> 01:52:42,420
You moved there like half the uh.
What is your experience like at the 

2363
01:52:42,420 --> 01:52:44,260
difference racism out here as opposed to
erase all joined in here.

2364
01:52:44,261 --> 01:52:46,070
We're wastes more separated,
but

2365
01:52:46,070 --> 01:52:51,070
it's like,
I don't think we see shit like why 

2366
01:52:51,070 --> 01:52:51,350
people don't even see the.
Like they're constantly getting like,

2367
01:52:51,560 --> 01:52:52,820
you don't want resisting.
Arrest is,

2368
01:52:52,970 --> 01:52:54,770
was this the residence after the first 
time someone's like,

2369
01:52:54,771 --> 01:52:55,460
Hey,
let me see your Id.

2370
01:52:55,461 --> 01:52:58,520
And they grab you and they push you.
The second time the same shit happens.

2371
01:52:58,521 --> 01:53:03,521
A cop pushes you the fourth time out of 
your car and they grab your wrist and 

2372
01:53:03,521 --> 01:53:03,521
go,
c'mon man.

2373
01:53:03,521 --> 01:53:04,460
If you pull back,
you've resisted arrest.

2374
01:53:04,790 --> 01:53:06,910
Wow.
Come on mom.

2375
01:53:06,920 --> 01:53:08,690
I'm late for a movie.
What?

2376
01:53:08,750 --> 01:53:11,480
Let's just talk about this first.
You've resisted arrest,

2377
01:53:11,560 --> 01:53:16,560
right?
It's up to their discretion whether or 

2378
01:53:16,560 --> 01:53:16,560
not they choose to arrest you or known 
restaurant people.

2379
01:53:16,560 --> 01:53:19,160
Some people get off on the exact same 
charge and they skate.

2380
01:53:19,250 --> 01:53:24,250
Whereas other people get arrested like a
year old white guy with a suit and you 

2381
01:53:24,250 --> 01:53:26,960
do a certain thing to stop and Frisk was
based on stop and Frisk people,

2382
01:53:27,020 --> 01:53:29,780
Latinos and blacks who looked like they 
might have some shit.

2383
01:53:29,810 --> 01:53:31,340
Right.
You didn't see it on Wall Street.

2384
01:53:31,341 --> 01:53:32,290
You didn't see them.
Of course,

2385
01:53:32,291 --> 01:53:37,291
to getting stopped and frisked on Wall 
Street on Wall Street weren't as 

2386
01:53:37,291 --> 01:53:40,001
outraged about it.
Stop and Frisk for shit that shouldn't 

2387
01:53:40,001 --> 01:53:40,001
be illegal in the first place.
So that's like illegal search.

2388
01:53:40,001 --> 01:53:41,210
It's like saying we're going to just 
search you,

2389
01:53:41,211 --> 01:53:42,890
but we have no reason to search it and 
well,

2390
01:53:42,891 --> 01:53:44,550
he could have been weapons,
right?

2391
01:53:44,610 --> 01:53:47,030
We shouldn't say we're looking for 
weapons they're looking for.

2392
01:53:47,170 --> 01:53:48,620
I mean it's dope,
man.

2393
01:53:48,621 --> 01:53:53,621
They want to get you for that.
Arrested you for dope or something that 

2394
01:53:54,531 --> 01:53:57,590
grows out of the earth that help scans.
I'll be honest,

2395
01:53:58,580 --> 01:53:59,130
if I.
Yeah,

2396
01:53:59,150 --> 01:54:01,730
if I'm a cop and I don't like you and I 
see something,

2397
01:54:01,731 --> 01:54:04,520
even if I don't think it's wrong,
if I'm a 23 year old,

2398
01:54:04,521 --> 01:54:05,120
I'm like,
well,

2399
01:54:05,121 --> 01:54:06,200
I'm going to put you in jail now.

2400
01:54:06,380 --> 01:54:07,820
Meanwhile you don't even think it's 
wrong.

2401
01:54:07,880 --> 01:54:10,370
Wall Street guy with a leather bound 
briefcase,

2402
01:54:10,371 --> 01:54:14,450
it has your in your engraved with your 
initials and your family crest on it.

2403
01:54:14,570 --> 01:54:16,910
They pull you over,
they stop and Frisk,

2404
01:54:16,911 --> 01:54:19,950
you pop open,
you see a bottle of pills,

2405
01:54:19,970 --> 01:54:21,650
heroin,
heroin,

2406
01:54:21,651 --> 01:54:24,950
pills,
but on that bottle has your name on it.

2407
01:54:24,951 --> 01:54:28,520
They will see heroin,
but I've registered.

2408
01:54:28,750 --> 01:54:30,860
You've registered,
you've paid your taxes.

2409
01:54:31,640 --> 01:54:34,940
The king got his price up.
This doctor as well,

2410
01:54:34,970 --> 01:54:39,970
you know,
I know that people would abuse their 

2411
01:54:39,970 --> 01:54:39,970
privileges based on stuff they don't 
believe in.

2412
01:54:39,970 --> 01:54:42,700
We have a comedian's basketball league 
and role playing and if it's directly 

2413
01:54:42,700 --> 01:54:44,030
they call technicals on curses and stuff
and so if you hear somebody.

2414
01:54:44,670 --> 01:54:49,670
Yup.
Well they don't know what the comedians 

2415
01:54:49,670 --> 01:54:49,670
league.
There's.

2416
01:54:49,670 --> 01:54:51,550
We just made her own comedians league,
but if we hear somebody cursing some 

2417
01:54:51,550 --> 01:54:52,120
other committee,
if I hear fucking Jeff Dye curse,

2418
01:54:52,130 --> 01:54:57,130
I'm cars,
the cars and we all try to get a 

2419
01:54:57,130 --> 01:54:57,450
technical shit.

2420
01:54:57,630 --> 01:54:59,870
No comment believes they should be not 
allowed.

2421
01:54:59,871 --> 01:55:01,400
Right?
But isn't that just for fun?

2422
01:55:01,401 --> 01:55:04,040
Like,
but we want the fucking benefit.

2423
01:55:04,041 --> 01:55:07,870
We're going to use our power so we don't
believe in 23,

2424
01:55:08,180 --> 01:55:09,110
somebody goes,
fuck you cop.

2425
01:55:09,111 --> 01:55:14,111
Like,
well I'll look at anything I can to put 

2426
01:55:14,111 --> 01:55:16,181
you in jail right now.
That would be like if we were playing 

2427
01:55:16,181 --> 01:55:16,181
pool and I go,
oh,

2428
01:55:16,181 --> 01:55:16,730
it's fucking shot.
Oh,

2429
01:55:16,731 --> 01:55:21,731
give me Paul enhance.
Exactly because I cursed and you 

2430
01:55:21,731 --> 01:55:21,731
actually ask for it.
No,

2431
01:55:21,731 --> 01:55:21,731
no,
no.

2432
01:55:21,731 --> 01:55:21,731
Dude,
you gotta give me a bond in.

2433
01:55:21,930 --> 01:55:23,870
Be a decline.
That rule.

2434
01:55:23,940 --> 01:55:27,700
Douchey came.
You guys do that playing basketball.

2435
01:55:27,710 --> 01:55:32,710
You need to stop.
You need to get on mushrooms and think 

2436
01:55:32,710 --> 01:55:34,190
about that call and technicals like that
or not having your jersey.

2437
01:55:34,191 --> 01:55:34,970
I'm like,
we're comics.

2438
01:55:34,971 --> 01:55:38,690
Nobody remembers to wash the Jersey and 
it's only comics playing against comics.

2439
01:55:38,720 --> 01:55:40,130
We made our own league.
So you know,

2440
01:55:40,180 --> 01:55:42,930
it's an open mic at least to get on that
thing.

2441
01:55:43,190 --> 01:55:43,670
Hilarious.

2442
01:55:44,070 --> 01:55:45,320
We have one team,
we call them the,

2443
01:55:45,370 --> 01:55:48,000
the corporate sellouts and that's all 
the agents and managers.

2444
01:55:48,960 --> 01:55:49,840
That's funny.
Yeah.

2445
01:55:49,841 --> 01:55:54,841
You know what you should do.
You should recruit really fucking good 

2446
01:55:54,841 --> 01:55:54,841
players and just get them to do an open 
mic.

2447
01:55:55,170 --> 01:55:56,970
Glassman shit.
That's what he does.

2448
01:55:56,971 --> 01:55:58,640
And he gets them to do one of the mic.
Like No.

2449
01:55:59,260 --> 01:56:04,260
The point is the play,
the game of comics while having fun 

2450
01:56:04,260 --> 01:56:05,390
playing games with will used to have a 
comics,

2451
01:56:05,391 --> 01:56:07,840
have a softball league back in Boston.
Really?

2452
01:56:07,890 --> 01:56:10,080
Oh my God.
He would get so competitive.

2453
01:56:10,410 --> 01:56:14,730
It was so crazy.
It was like competitive people screaming

2454
01:56:14,731 --> 01:56:19,620
at people over fucking fouls or,
or were ball was in the ball was out,

2455
01:56:19,621 --> 01:56:20,100
you know?
I was like,

2456
01:56:20,160 --> 01:56:21,300
oh my God.
Yeah.

2457
01:56:21,540 --> 01:56:24,180
I remember like people in each other's 
face throwing the gloves down,

2458
01:56:24,181 --> 01:56:26,640
screaming at each other.
A comics bat baseball game.

2459
01:56:27,420 --> 01:56:29,760
But that's Boston Davey babies without 
their bottles.

2460
01:56:29,820 --> 01:56:31,620
I was back at Boston that they fixed 
that club,

2461
01:56:31,860 --> 01:56:34,440
that laugh.
Boston sound system is awesome.

2462
01:56:34,441 --> 01:56:35,820
Okay.
You don't have to worry about it anymore

2463
01:56:35,840 --> 01:56:40,840
on the automation because everybody had 
that rumor that was out at the sound 

2464
01:56:40,840 --> 01:56:43,611
system.
Sucked is loud as fuck it did feedback 

2465
01:56:43,611 --> 01:56:43,790
once when I got like on top of the,
the,

2466
01:56:44,010 --> 01:56:47,730
the actual speaker was talking about.
But that happens almost everywhere,

2467
01:56:47,880 --> 01:56:48,990
you know,
unless it's perfect.

2468
01:56:49,190 --> 01:56:54,190
It's something the Improv does you.
There's never a fuck up if you're 

2469
01:56:54,190 --> 01:56:57,471
working in Improv.
Like if the sound system's always 

2470
01:56:57,471 --> 01:56:57,600
perfect,
the seeding is always perfect.

2471
01:56:57,601 --> 01:57:00,690
There's never sight line issues.
They don't ever fuck around.

2472
01:57:00,870 --> 01:57:02,940
Like you know,
some clubs that your work out there kind

2473
01:57:02,941 --> 01:57:07,941
of funky.
Like if you stand on one medium so you 

2474
01:57:07,941 --> 01:57:10,041
can't even see flyballs yeah.
But it was worse because there's often 

2475
01:57:10,041 --> 01:57:11,940
pillars in the room and if you're behind
that pillar and you will go to the right

2476
01:57:11,941 --> 01:57:16,941
side,
like the people that are behind that 

2477
01:57:16,941 --> 01:57:16,941
pillar literally can't even see you.
Like they're there,

2478
01:57:16,941 --> 01:57:18,750
but unless they're,
they have to watch monitors in a club.

2479
01:57:18,751 --> 01:57:21,470
The improv has that nailed.
They always say like,

2480
01:57:21,480 --> 01:57:23,670
