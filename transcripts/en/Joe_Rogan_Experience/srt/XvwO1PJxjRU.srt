1
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:10,020
[inaudible] this episode of the podcast.

2
00:00:10,021 --> 00:00:14,520
See, didn't say it already
took my Alpha brain. I'm Brody,

3
00:00:14,521 --> 00:00:18,060
Steve and I took on the Brody Stevens,
a cadence.

4
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,820
A lot of people already
took my Alpha brain.

5
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:24,300
Eight one eight I need to hang around
him while I used to be able to do a good

6
00:00:24,301 --> 00:00:26,940
Brody imitation,
but it's gotten very generic.

7
00:00:26,941 --> 00:00:31,860
Now I've lost the tone. You know I
still have Joe D as in my arsenal,

8
00:00:31,861 --> 00:00:34,680
but I've lost the Brody tone. I need
to be around him. I need to see him.

9
00:00:34,681 --> 00:00:35,514
I need to feel him.

10
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:40,980
This episode is brought
to you by Squarespace and
Squarespace is the all in one

11
00:00:40,981 --> 00:00:45,210
platform that makes it fast and easy to
create your own professional website.

12
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,330
Yes. You the average person,
the Sam Tripoli's of the world,

13
00:00:48,331 --> 00:00:51,870
the Joe Rogan's the world. Brian Redman
is far more computer savvy than us.

14
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:54,420
He can actually,
he can actually create a real website.

15
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:58,650
He knows co we are not capable of that.
I'm sure Jamie can do that as well. Me,

16
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:02,990
not so much. I'll show you how to
throw a sidekick. I can't do nothing.

17
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:08,790
I came do sidekick, but you can
do Squarespace, Sam, Tripoli.

18
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:12,360
You can do it. You could set
up a fucking online store son.

19
00:01:12,361 --> 00:01:16,350
I have faith in you and it's
all done through a simple,

20
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,270
easy drop and drag interface.

21
00:01:18,271 --> 00:01:22,680
Just like if you are attaching an email
to your Facebook page or a picture,

22
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:27,270
you know, cutting and pasting and email,
posting a picture, posting a video,

23
00:01:27,271 --> 00:01:29,160
you know how to do that on Twitter.
If you can do that,

24
00:01:29,161 --> 00:01:33,330
you can make your own fucking
website and it can be awesome.

25
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:37,410
It can be awesome with a full
online store, sand triplet,

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,990
sell copies online of your new CD
that came out motherfucking today,

27
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:48,420
Sam Tripoli. What's it called? Believe
in yourself. I liked that message.

28
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:53,520
This message can all be relayed through
squarespace.com and if you go to

29
00:01:53,521 --> 00:01:58,500

support. Um, and uh,

31
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:03,870
as I said,

32
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:07,230
simple drag and drop interface
and websites that work
on everything had to work

33
00:02:07,231 --> 00:02:11,850
on your iPad. It'll work on a
android device, an android tablet,

34
00:02:11,851 --> 00:02:16,500
or work on Unix. If you're a one of those
fucking Weirdos who had cysts on Unix.

53
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,020

Save yourself some mother fucking money.

56
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:37,720
Yeah. We're also brought to you
by [inaudible] dot com that is,

57
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:42,750
oh and and I t on it is a website where
you can buy shit that can make things

58
00:03:43,481 --> 00:03:46,500
better. What do I mean
by that? What on it is,

59
00:03:46,501 --> 00:03:49,840
is what we call a human
optimization website.

60
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:54,190
And what we sell is shit like Alpha brain,
which does work.

61
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:58,930
How to prove it. Show I took one, I took
four, I take four. I'm fucking crazy.

62
00:03:58,931 --> 00:04:02,440
I'm accessive cause she got a brain.
You got a big brain. I feel like, um,

63
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:04,930
there's nothing in their toxic,
I'm going to let this pitch right.

64
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,820
What are you afraid of?
Not Afraid of much,

65
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:10,270
but I'm definitely not afraid to take it.
For Alpha brains for a show,

66
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:11,411
what is Alpha brain?

67
00:04:11,411 --> 00:04:13,510
Alpha brain is a nootropic and
if you don't know what neutral,

68
00:04:13,511 --> 00:04:15,100
because I suggest you Google it.

69
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:18,730
Google all the people that say the
vitamins dealt worked. Goodall, Google,

70
00:04:18,731 --> 00:04:22,690
all the people that say
nootropics do work vitamins,

71
00:04:22,691 --> 00:04:24,670
new tropics nutrition.

72
00:04:24,671 --> 00:04:29,280
There's so many contradicting
opinions when it comes to um,

73
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:33,040
uh, health and wellness. I am no expert.

74
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:37,180
I have talked to a fuck load of experts
though and we've been very fortunate to

75
00:04:37,181 --> 00:04:42,070
have some experts on the podcast exports
like a doctor, Rhonda Patrick, uh,

76
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:45,450
experts that actually
understand nutrition.

77
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:47,800
So it's a very complicated
thing and there's a lot of like,

78
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,560
you'll real read on one website.
This is going to kill you.

79
00:04:50,561 --> 00:04:52,480
And then another website,
this is essential.

80
00:04:52,481 --> 00:04:57,340
One website says this prevents
cancer. Um, believe in yourself.

81
00:04:57,410 --> 00:05:02,410
Logos being created right now while
we're doing this at hot males,

82
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:08,680
like what am I, yeah, it's
the black hotmail. Anyway,

83
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:09,041
uh,

84
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:14,041
on it.com we sell 'em all sorts of various
supplements as well as strength and

85
00:05:14,621 --> 00:05:15,520
conditioning equipment.

86
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:19,930
All sorts of shit that you can use to
benefit your life are our idea behind

87
00:05:19,931 --> 00:05:24,931
doing this show is what's the stuff that
I use that I feel makes my life work

88
00:05:25,781 --> 00:05:28,300
better? Like what's the things
that make my body work better?

89
00:05:28,301 --> 00:05:32,000
What's the things that make my mind work
better? And Aubrey and I have a Servo.

90
00:05:32,001 --> 00:05:36,840
The similar idea about that. The
similar, a similar opinion. You know,

91
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:41,560
both of us are fascinated
by, um, the latest trends and
strength and conditioning.

92
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:46,450
Both of us. This is distracting
me. What does the tea,

93
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:50,110
what are the people see right
now? They see a logo. Yeah. Okay.

94
00:05:50,111 --> 00:05:54,190
That is not a fucking commercial
jackass. You confusing. Fuck.

95
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:56,950
That's the problem, right? You distract,

96
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,460
distract me. There's just no way for
me to do a logo at the same time. No,

97
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:05,810
don't do it. Leave on it.com. Just
leave this little thing scrolling it.

98
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,180
Can you do all that shit off
screen? Is that possible? Yeah.

99
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:13,310
It's not that it has to. Oh Wow. Punched
rock's going to have to wait. That's fine.

100
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:15,913
I'm good with that.

101
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,080
On [inaudible] dot com go, go there. O, n,

102
00:06:19,081 --> 00:06:22,290
n I t used the Codeword Rogan save
10% off any and all supplements.

103
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:25,710
Everything is explained. They're far
better than I can explain to you. Um,

104
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:29,970
but one thing I will say is
that on it has a 100% 30 pill,

105
00:06:29,971 --> 00:06:34,320
90 day money back guarantee on all the
controversial shit like shroom tech sport

106
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:35,213
or Alpha brain.

107
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:40,450
Reason being is people are justifiably
skeptical about things that claim to, uh,

108
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:44,190
enhance cognitive function or things
that claim to give you more endurance.

109
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:47,910
He should be skeptical. There's
a lot of bunk shit out there. Um,

110
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:52,410
what we had on and have done is
taken what we believe is the law,

111
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:55,290
the best body of research
that explains you supplements,

112
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:56,610
put it up under research.

113
00:06:56,970 --> 00:07:01,080
And we've also done our own tests on
our own tests on Alpha brain and ongoing

114
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:04,710
other tests on the other various
supplements that we have.

115
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:08,490
But all of them are backed by science
and that science is all researched with

116
00:07:08,491 --> 00:07:12,960
references all uh, under
the, the research tab, uh,

117
00:07:12,961 --> 00:07:16,920
whether it's for Alpha brain or for
any of the other supplements, there's,

118
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:19,860
if you don't think they
work and you try him,

119
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:23,280
just say this is bullshit and you get
your money back. It's that simple.

120
00:07:23,281 --> 00:07:24,510
You don't even have to return the product.

121
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,840
No one's trying to rip you off just
trying to sell you shit that I use.

122
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:33,590
Your body is made out of food and
vitamins are in food and we've isolated

123
00:07:34,201 --> 00:07:36,900
certain, not we obviously
not me, I'm retarded.

124
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:41,280
But they have isolated certain things
in vitamins that can enhance various,

125
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:42,960
various parts of your life,

126
00:07:42,961 --> 00:07:47,460
whether it's your endurance or whether
it's cognitive function. All of it. Again,

127
00:07:47,461 --> 00:07:48,840
explained that on it. O, n,

128
00:07:48,841 --> 00:07:52,740
n I t use the Codeword Rogan and
save 10% off any and all supplements.

129
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:56,070
Oh, that's, wow. That's a website.

130
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:59,960
It's an amazingly designed

00:07:59,961 --> 00:08:02,690
it's cool when you scroll
down, it moves. Yeah.

132
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,740
But what's really dope is
that it's all made in house.

133
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:08,900
Ah, the, the honor people that
work in the actual studio itself,

134

All Day.

143
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:50,410
We're full Sam Tripoli. Boom,
back in the saddle. Powerful.

144
00:08:50,411 --> 00:08:54,950
Which Sam Tripoli and with a brand
new comedy CD I brought one for.

145
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:56,063
I know

146
00:08:56,070 --> 00:09:00,360
some people don't even have CD players
anymore, but uh, I bought it for you.

147
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:04,270
This our work by my buddy and uh,
and it's called, you can do this,

148
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:06,990
it's called believe in yourself.
It was either that,

149
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:10,080
it's either that or I was
going to call it shady shit,

150
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:14,660
but I didn't think iTunes would let
me put that up. So it's good. Yeah.

151
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:18,840
Well kind of a, if you listen to the
album, you get why I call it that.

152
00:09:18,841 --> 00:09:22,530
So it's like fun. Well I have no your
materials. So I would agree with that.

153
00:09:22,531 --> 00:09:27,180
Like thematically sort of a,
a fun, having fun with it.

154
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:29,410
It just goes against the grain.

155
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:33,000
It's the feedback that people have
already listened to it really love it.

156
00:09:33,001 --> 00:09:35,760
And I'm, you know, I haven't
put out a CD for a while.

157
00:09:35,761 --> 00:09:40,560
So I was like really excited to put this
whole group of hour of power together.

158
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:43,620
And I did at the Edmonton comedy strip,

159
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:47,970
which is one of my favorite clubs to
play because it's literally the only club

160
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:52,330
where I got off stage and two
separate times the owners one, uh,

161
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:56,430
Tammy one, Rick Bronson would pull
me aside and literally go, dude,

162
00:09:57,150 --> 00:10:01,560
can you work dirtier? And I go, what? They
go, we'd really like you to work dirtier.

163
00:10:01,561 --> 00:10:05,250
And I'm like, are you crazy? So
ridiculous. So then I go up and say,

164
00:10:05,251 --> 00:10:08,370
I'm just getting filthy for the
sake of getting filthy. And uh,

165
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:10,710
but it's one of the grays
clubs. And I said, you know,

166
00:10:10,711 --> 00:10:13,440
this would be great place to do
CD. So I decided to do it. They're,

167
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,350
they're maniacs up there and
now they're at Minton's crazy.

168
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:18,080
Well they're living in a place,
you know,

169
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:21,570
it gets 50 fucking below zero in the
winter there and those are hardy folk and

170
00:10:21,571 --> 00:10:24,270
everyone's got cash cause
they're fracking. Oh yeah.

171
00:10:24,271 --> 00:10:25,320
They're all fracking up there.

172
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:30,600
It's their unemployment is like 0.0001%.

173
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:34,920
Like they're giving like 12 year olds
shops because there's not enough people.

174
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:38,040
None of people that go around
for all the jobs. Well it's uh,

175
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:41,040
it's interesting too because people
that live in that kind of environment,

176
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:45,480
if you could survive that kind of a
winter and you stay job or no job,

177
00:10:45,481 --> 00:10:49,820
if you don't fucking plot and escape a
year, you're a different kind of breed.

178
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:53,850
Like yeah, it's blue collar with
money, which is a dangerous situation.

179
00:10:53,851 --> 00:10:55,140
It's blue collar with money,

180
00:10:55,141 --> 00:10:59,310
but it's also people with like
a certain level of character,

181
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:03,540
like you have to, to get
through the winter, you can't
be too much of a fuck off.

182
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:06,600
You know what I mean? Yeah.
Like when Shit gets 50 below,

183
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:09,270
you've got to be on your God Damn Toe.
You gotta be on your game.

184
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:12,810
Like if you are a real case,
fuck up.

185
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:16,770
The kind of guy who like winds up falling
asleep and parking lots all the time

186
00:11:16,771 --> 00:11:20,490
and you have security guard
finds you at 9:00 AM you die.

187
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,560
That chick that happened to some,
I dunno where it was,

188
00:11:22,561 --> 00:11:23,600
somewhere in the northeast,

189
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:28,660
she passed out on her doorstep and then
she woke up and like half her body had

190
00:11:30,721 --> 00:11:34,710
all frostbites and they were going to
have to amputate shit because she had

191
00:11:34,711 --> 00:11:38,330
passed out on her who just walked
and somebody had walked by going,

192
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:42,510
I think that girl is dead. Nobody
says anything. She was only 19 also.

193
00:11:42,511 --> 00:11:45,720
She was like, oh, it's
awful. It's blues man.

194
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:49,620
Especially when you're 19 when you're
19 you don't fucking, you know,

195
00:11:49,621 --> 00:11:53,220
you don't know how to drink yet. You could
go way too deep. Like she was probably,

196
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:54,160
forget the frostbite.

197
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:57,870
She's probably on death's
door. Yeah. So how,

198
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:01,120
how fucked up is her body and
she's hot too. How fucked up.

199
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:08,530
Scroll up. What does it
say? What's the story? Hey,

200
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:12,010
this isn't as good as may
lose limbs. Oh God. Damn.

201
00:12:12,011 --> 00:12:14,080
It's her hands were three times the size,

202
00:12:14,081 --> 00:12:17,170
but their skin split from palm to finger.
Oh my God.

203
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:20,830
They spent the night playing drinking
games with friends during which he lost

204
00:12:20,831 --> 00:12:22,270
several rounds to check off,

205
00:12:22,271 --> 00:12:26,770
like down at least 10 Tequila shots
tweeted earlier that day to kill shots

206
00:12:26,771 --> 00:12:30,250
tonight. Yup. All my
God. That's awful. Joe,

207
00:12:30,251 --> 00:12:33,610
do you remember a guy named Fast Eddie
that use hang out at the comedy store?

208
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:37,840
The Fat Mexican. He was called
fast that he's there all the time.

209
00:12:37,841 --> 00:12:41,020
He was there for his birthday
one time. Was he a comedian? No,

210
00:12:41,021 --> 00:12:43,450
he's just one of the guys that
really nice due to hangs out.

211
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:45,290
He's saying out the patio.
I know him.

212
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:48,790
You hear them start to hang
out there forever. Okay.

213
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:51,700
I probably know him that for ever.
And uh,

214
00:12:51,701 --> 00:12:55,420
it was his birthday and everyone was
buying them shots and we're driving around

215
00:12:55,421 --> 00:13:00,200
and I mean he is gone. I mean, he is God,
he's like dropped me off at the club.

216
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:03,590
You know, it's the guys who were like,
yeah, we'll drop you off. You know,

217
00:13:03,591 --> 00:13:06,590
we will just throw you out of the car
and you might die in a dumpster. But,

218
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:11,140
but if it's a chick, nobody lets that
happen. Everyone's like, no, you come on,

219
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:14,470
you too drunk. That's not true.
Depending on what kind of chicken is,

220
00:13:14,471 --> 00:13:17,260
if it's a giant mouthy
chick collects to fight,

221
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:21,280
dudes will kick that bitch out of the
car and hit the gas. Get your ass kicked.

222
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:22,240
Yeah.

223
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:26,830
I mean only bad people would kick anyone
out of the car in the fucking winter.

224
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:30,730
Oh, you have to be a really bad person
and you're like, okay, good luck.

225
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:35,320
Or that guy's a total piece of shit. He
some loud mouth dude wants to fight cops,

226
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:38,530
you know, driving by in a
rolled on, we fuck you pig.

227
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:41,680
Like put the fucking window down dude,
what are you doing?

228
00:13:41,681 --> 00:13:45,100
We were driving and I just heard my window
down and go, what's up? And he's like,

229
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:49,810
whew. And he just hold down the
side of my window, which is nice.

230
00:13:49,811 --> 00:13:54,811
They got outside the car and didn't just
fill up my backseat with Mexican vomit.

231
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:58,870
You ever hung out with a dude who doesn't
have it? The whole lot of friends,

232
00:13:58,871 --> 00:14:02,380
but he seems like a cool guy and you're
like, man, this guy's pretty cool.

233
00:14:02,381 --> 00:14:04,750
You know when or why did nobody's
hanging around with this guy?

234
00:14:04,751 --> 00:14:07,220
Come hang out with us and
then the dude gets drug.

235
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:12,370
It just becomes a maniac.
Fuck you to the bouncers and fucking,

236
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:16,820
I mean there are dudes like that that
gets this. Jekyll and Hyde just get, oh,

237
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:20,240
I used to be way back in the
day you used to be used to be,

238
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:24,160
do know you were Jacqueline Hyde because
I knew I would just get drunk and I was

239
00:14:24,161 --> 00:14:28,990
just like, but did you feel big?
You becoming Jacqueline Hyde? Yeah,

240
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:31,940
but you would do it again.
You don't really know.

241
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:35,020
That's why I don't really drink that much.
I don't even drink at all.

242
00:14:35,021 --> 00:14:37,540
Actually back then when you would
do it, you would like, okay,

243
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:40,570
here comes taking my medicine.
I used to warn people.

244
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:45,580
Sometimes I get a little crazy. I
been around. You are drunk, dude. I'm,

245
00:14:45,581 --> 00:14:47,500
I'm gonna be honest with you.
I don't,

246
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:52,030
I don't think you're a
Jekyll and Hyde Guy lion now.

247
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,840
Well No, no, no. I've been around you
and you're drunk and you were younger.

248
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:57,590
However I fucking doing
you at least 10 years.

249
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:03,310
Probably like 13 I got picked up at the
comedy store and just be around 2000 so

250
00:15:04,581 --> 00:15:08,890
during that time we have all seen
each other in completely in a,

251
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:11,360
in a state of,
if somebody wanted to have sex with us,

252
00:15:11,361 --> 00:15:14,800
it would technically be raped.
Yeah, that'd be raping us. We've,

253
00:15:14,801 --> 00:15:18,290
we've all been in that state seeing
each other that can't rape the willing.

254
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,390
Right.
But you can according to,

255
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:24,080
there's like a lot of people that are
actually arguing this and they have to see

256
00:15:24,081 --> 00:15:25,190
you can rape guys.
Yes.

257
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:28,340
There have to say it about
guys when they're saying
you about women if you want,

258
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:32,570
there's obviously they recognize that
there's a real issue with that when it

259
00:15:32,571 --> 00:15:36,320
comes to like being contradictory
and being hypocritical.

260
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,890
If you start saying that if a man has
sex with a woman who's had a few drinks,

261
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:44,000
that's rape where you have
to also conversely say that
if a woman has sex with a

262
00:15:44,001 --> 00:15:47,870
man, has had a few drinks, that's
rape and if you're both drunk,

263
00:15:47,871 --> 00:15:51,470
you're raping the shit out of each
other. That is the weird thing, dude,

264
00:15:51,471 --> 00:15:55,910
is that it's a double illegal act.
So yeah,

265
00:15:55,911 --> 00:15:58,730
technically she did rape pim,

266
00:15:58,731 --> 00:16:03,590
but I mean is it not the same
face on technical at all?

267
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:05,840
It's not a tactical at all
because she didn't write them.

268
00:16:05,841 --> 00:16:08,870
She had sex with a drunk guy and we all
know what that is and we have to add all

269
00:16:08,871 --> 00:16:12,950
these goddamn extra layers. It doesn't
change the actual act of what it is.

270
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:16,970
The real problem with defining all these
things is this is rape and that is rape

271
00:16:16,971 --> 00:16:21,020
and this is privilege and that
is, no, no, no, no, no. It's,
those are all just labels.

272
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:25,010
You're putting labels on things that
we know exactly what they are. Okay.

273
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:29,540
If a school teacher blows a 14 year old,
it's not rape.

274
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:33,920
I totally agree with you on that one,
but here's the thing. If she's gross,

275
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:38,600
it's an issue. It's not at all,
and we all know that to be a fact.

276
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:40,940
We all know that.
If a chick who looks like Tara,

277
00:16:40,941 --> 00:16:45,020
Patrick winds up blowing
some 17 year old kid,

278
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:49,010
that's not a goddamn crime. I mean, yeah,
it's going to fuck that kid's head up,

279
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:53,150
but it's not a god damn. Not in a bad way
though. What Dude's like? Oh my God, Tara,

280
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:56,810
Patrick's suck my dick. How has it
been raped by high fiving people?

281
00:16:56,811 --> 00:16:59,150
How was it rape? No, I
agree with you on that one,

282
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:03,320
but not live in the country where it's
like you can't technically have different

283
00:17:03,321 --> 00:17:06,410
laws for different people, right? We
have to apply these laws to everybody.

284
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:08,690
I agree with everything you're saying.
It's good though.

285
00:17:08,691 --> 00:17:12,610
It's good that people would
that hypocritical because
it exposes it when the end

286
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:13,640
is subject like this,

287
00:17:13,641 --> 00:17:17,450
which becomes so preposterous when you
start talking about it exposes how crazy

288
00:17:17,451 --> 00:17:22,040
it is. There are people, men and
women like to get drunk and fuck.

289
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,940
If you engage them in that activity,
you don't automatically become a rapist.

290
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:30,680
Yeah. But there is a level that
you get to that gets rapey. Yeah,

291
00:17:30,681 --> 00:17:34,400
there is. And we all know this.
Yes. Label it all you want.

292
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:38,570
We all know there's something wrong if
someone's really fucked up and blacked

293
00:17:38,571 --> 00:17:42,470
out and you say fuck it and
you have sex with them anyway.

294
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:45,920
That's crazy. That's fucked
up. There's also women,

295
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:49,650
there's also women that you've met that
her so conniving that could probably

296
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:50,210
rate like,

297
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:52,920
like, Hey, I want to have
a Joe Rogan baby, you know,

298
00:17:52,921 --> 00:17:56,940
and like gets you drunk to the point
where you fuck them and comment on Condo.

299
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:57,893
Yeah,
yeah.

300
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:02,620
It's totally possible. But again,
you, there's had to take a condom,

301
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,900
they have to grab the condom,
take it,

302
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:10,320
put it in the toilet and flush it because
these women will take that card and

303
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:15,340
squirt that bait and it's this x and the
thought of just having a baby for the,

304
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:20,290
for the sake of making money.
The fact that that's acceptable or not

305
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,560
just that it is definitely that.

306
00:18:22,561 --> 00:18:26,820
But I think there's also a part of it is
having a baby with a guy who ordinarily

307
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,690
doesn't want anything more than sex from
you. Yeah. Now you connect with them,

308
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:35,400
you know, so there's, there's
those options. There's
someone who just wants a baby,

309
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:38,400
you know, there's some people that just
want a baby and this girls had just like,

310
00:18:38,401 --> 00:18:39,340
God damn it,
I want a baby.

311
00:18:39,341 --> 00:18:43,110
I'm going to give a fuck if this guy wants
a baby or not. I want a baby. You know,

312
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:46,520
obviously not supposed to do that.
You should probably like tell the guy,

313
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:49,530
like you could probably find a guy
who's willing to just give you a baby.

314
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:52,560
But then it comes back and then
there's all that legal stuff.

315
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:56,330
Well, there was legal stuff
with a guy who, uh, got he got,

316
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,960
he was a sperm donor.
He gave sperm to these people.

317
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:02,360
They had a kid and then the,

318
00:19:02,361 --> 00:19:07,361
he got sued for a child support and he
lost because his DNA made the child,

319
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:13,760
I mean, this poor guy, he wasn't involved
in the raising of this kid at all.

320
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:18,900
That's incredible. This new thing with
the guy from Los Boys Up, lost sellers,

321
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:23,870
Patrick, the movie, what's his name? Pat.
He was like the lead vampire. He, uh,

322
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,190
his ex wife,
he had,

323
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:29,250
they had donated sperm or some
shit like that and she took in,

324
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,140
had a kid and then he,

325
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:34,520
he was trying to get custody or at least
get visitation rights and he finally

326
00:19:34,521 --> 00:19:37,580
got, got the right by the
judge because he is the father.

327
00:19:37,581 --> 00:19:40,950
But it's like that's some crazy shit
that you could donate sperm and then it,

328
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:43,850
then it comes all this crazy
issues with it. How's that?

329
00:19:43,851 --> 00:19:48,810
Even society's just crazy. Jason. Patrick.
Yeah. Patrick. Right. What I say? Uh,

330
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:53,150
we all think we remembered his name. Yeah.
The lead to God about that dude. Yeah.

331
00:19:53,151 --> 00:19:56,300
He like, he was really big and
the, I think he did like speed too,

332
00:19:56,301 --> 00:19:57,140
and then it just went off

333
00:19:57,140 --> 00:20:00,890
the rails. He, um, is uh,
John John Machado student.

334
00:20:00,891 --> 00:20:03,290
I've seen him hanging around with
John Job before it takes Jujitsu.

335
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:06,540
I love that name. John Chalk. You can't
work at Burger King with a name Sean Joke.

336
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,660
You could, yeah. I'm John Jock.

337
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:13,490
Jason Patch closer to be
reunited with Sun. Okay,

338
00:20:13,491 --> 00:20:17,570
let's let me read this. I'll get sad.
He's a sperm donor and now he's got a kid.

339
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:21,230
Well he was married to
this woman I believe,

340
00:20:21,231 --> 00:20:25,020
and she took his sperm and had a
child and now he wants the beans.

341
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,600
Kids' life. Oh boy. Bar. Bar Bar.

342
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,260
That's why even when you
get into massage parlors,

343
00:20:30,261 --> 00:20:32,750
they tied the condom in a night
and throw it in the frigerator.

344
00:20:32,751 --> 00:20:34,970
I think it's sell that shit.
They don't throw it away.

345
00:20:34,971 --> 00:20:36,410
And they take the condom out of that room.

346
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:41,240
Yeah. They don't want your
loads. Do they nuke your lows?

347
00:20:41,241 --> 00:20:46,060
I throw them in the microwave and then
make Godzilla mother load is out there

348
00:20:46,061 --> 00:20:50,940
talking about that's his gold and then
their condoms and like we'd find a mate.

349
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:55,470
Got It. Boas. How smooth sailing
from here. What do I got here?

350
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:58,630
Calling their friends up to you to do. Do,
do, do. Oh, what's up Matt? Too little.

351
00:20:58,631 --> 00:21:02,810
I got here. I tell you what I got. I
got a little rubber baggies of goals.

352
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,840
This is our ticket out of here.

353
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:10,570
I got red band come by
and calm down Twitter.

354
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:15,680
He got a hundred town
Jean come.

355
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:19,680
He's gonna want it back. Rubber band, man.

356
00:21:19,681 --> 00:21:22,180
It's a little more talent than I
think people give him credit for.

357
00:21:22,181 --> 00:21:25,990
I got to work with recently and
I feel like a, I never really,

358
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:28,540
I mean it was just fun hanging out with
them and they think he's a little more

359
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:33,250
time looking at him because I don't
say while you're looking at him,

360
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:37,480
that's his weird. I am weird though.
You are weird. I'll give you that.

361
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:41,680
I'll give it back. I'm a weird
dude. I'm a little crazy,

362
00:21:41,681 --> 00:21:46,510
but I got a new CD out.
Believe in yourself by it. Is
it on iTunes? Awesome. Yes,

363
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:50,100
and it's on all things. records.com
Brian, we talked about this before, but

364
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:54,650
why don't you put together like a set
and do like a CD or something digital

365
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:59,130
release? I need to do. They just need to
do more stage time first though. Yeah. Do,

366
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:03,780
yeah. Do comedy is that Shit. I can't,
I can't get spots anywhere in La.

367
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:05,960
Um, you can, you just put
together your own shows.

368
00:22:05,961 --> 00:22:09,710
Do dual those fucking small idea.
I can tell you where you can go.

369
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:11,750
You can go to the John Lovitz,

370
00:22:11,751 --> 00:22:15,590
you can go to this new club
out on Hollywood boulevard.

371
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:16,910
There's a bunch of place you can go.

372
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:19,310
I mean if he can't get the
store and you can't do the,

373
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,000
I don't know why the Improv
doesn't put you up. Yeah.

374
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:26,280
Probably someone doesn't like your
sexiness. That's right. I do believe

375
00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:31,070
your man, he makes people
very, very intimidated. You
can get spots though, dude.

376
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:36,250
You can get spots. You just got to
hustle. You got to hustle and do it is,

377
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:39,140
you know, that's the issue. You've
got to decide what do you like doing,

378
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:42,840
like doing a million other podcasts or
do you want to do like two or three your

379
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:46,750
podcasts,
podcasts a lot lately and be smart.

380
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:50,120
It's focusing on the comedy thing,
which is so tiring. Cause as you know,

381
00:22:50,121 --> 00:22:52,610
like going on the road and
finding a spot yourself doing it.

382
00:22:52,611 --> 00:22:55,860
The Doug Stanhope Way getting like a
rock club and getting the door and doing

383
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:59,030
all it is the most stressful thing ever.
That's why managers,

384
00:22:59,031 --> 00:23:04,031
I get that 10 or 20% that
they take because that shit
is just annoying as fuck.

385
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:07,990
It's just hard though.
It's stressful. And Harvey,

386
00:23:08,010 --> 00:23:11,810
I just went to Vegas and it was such a,
it was so fun. That place was amazing.

387
00:23:11,811 --> 00:23:16,280
But there this the headache around
booking it and getting everything.

388
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:19,370
You could get somebody, dude, you can
get somebody to book you. It's worth it.

389
00:23:19,371 --> 00:23:22,850
And they can put you in places where you
ordinarily might not have a connection

390
00:23:22,851 --> 00:23:26,110
with a guy. And have you tried
to get a booking agent? No,

391
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:27,470
I don't even know what to do.

392
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:30,560
Well you should get one like other comics
are doing it and you're friends with a

393
00:23:30,561 --> 00:23:32,900
lot of comics. You know, it's
not hard to do. But once,

394
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:37,730
once you like start doing it on a weekly
basis and really hammered and then the

395
00:23:37,731 --> 00:23:39,050
act like starts to take shape.

396
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:40,920
I've doesn't blessed man lately.

397
00:23:40,921 --> 00:23:44,460
I've been touring a lot and it's
totally fun when you just keep going.

398
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:48,320
When you get to work on a joke and over
and over again and then all of a sudden

399
00:23:48,321 --> 00:23:50,660
you just riff on a new
punchline now just boom, boom,

400
00:23:50,661 --> 00:23:52,780
boom and it just builds and you know,

401
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:57,470
cause I'm trying to now write a new hour
to do an the finally shoot something

402
00:23:57,471 --> 00:23:58,970
I've never shot in our special.

403
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,140
So you want to ride an hour additional
to that and then shoot it and how much

404
00:24:03,141 --> 00:24:05,330
time?
Well I'm debating whether I do like,

405
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:09,770
cause I have another CD called crime
fighter and that material's really old but

406
00:24:09,771 --> 00:24:13,400
do the best of this and this best of this
new stuff I'm doing and then shoot an

407
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,440
hour or just do a whole new hour.

408
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:19,930
They do a whole new hour because that way
people could still find this stuff and

409
00:24:19,931 --> 00:24:22,560
they could still tuned to
the old stuff. Yeah. I'm,

410
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:25,210
I'm a about 35 minutes into a new hour.

411
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:29,290
I made a mistake once of not doing a
totally new set because my, my set,

412
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:31,270
like I had certain jokes
that were just better,

413
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:35,320
which in my showtime special and then
when I did my CD on comedy central,

414
00:24:35,321 --> 00:24:37,270
there was a couple of bits that
I don't know how many bits,

415
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:40,570
but there was more than one that crossed
over. That was just a better bit now.

416
00:24:40,571 --> 00:24:42,460
And I've just stuck to the
in any way cause I was like,

417
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:46,840
not too many people saw the Netflix
one because Netflix in 2005 was in its

418
00:24:46,841 --> 00:24:50,980
infancy. It was a completely different
thing. But uh, I regret that now.

419
00:24:50,981 --> 00:24:51,910
I probably shouldn't have done that.

420
00:24:51,911 --> 00:24:53,420
I probably should have
just done totally new,

421
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:56,950
but I had better versions of
those bits. I'm like, God damn it.

422
00:24:56,951 --> 00:24:58,030
These are so much better.

423
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:01,840
I saw your new special,
it was on youtube and yeah,

424
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:05,340
it's hard. He, yeah, people take it and
they stick it online. You know, you can,

425
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:06,990
I don't really try to take it down.

426
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,550
I uh,
down a couple of times.

427
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:12,270
I feel like there's a bunch of bits
on there that I hadn't heard before.

428
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:17,160
Did you do new stuff in that
special? Yeah, some of the
brave as shit right there.

429
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:22,600
Putting out new bits on
the, and especially I guess,
well one of the things about

430
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:25,050
doing a podcast is you're,

431
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:28,500
even if you're not writing during the
time that you're doing the podcast,

432
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:32,130
you're thinking about shit it a
way and you're going over like,

433
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:35,910
especially if we're like doing a podcast
like this, like hanging out with comics,

434
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:36,900
just talking shit.

435
00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:40,680
It's not like someone who's promoting a
very specific book or you know about a

436
00:25:40,681 --> 00:25:42,960
very specific subject,
which is fascinating as well,

437
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:48,110
but doing these kind of podcasts like
you're forced to think for long periods of

438
00:25:48,901 --> 00:25:52,770
time and you get ideas and I
think it's easier to write.

439
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:54,150
I think it's easy to write shit.

440
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:55,830
I think there's a bunch of
different ways to write,

441
00:25:56,610 --> 00:26:00,240
but I think that just talking as a is a
way to write too well, you know what is,

442
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:04,440
what does writing, it's just coming up
with an idea, having a creative idea.

443
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:07,650
You get a lot of those just talking,
you know they're not,

444
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:12,150
it's not the only thing. You know that
you also get a lot of them doing stand up.

445
00:26:12,330 --> 00:26:15,270
You get a lot of them writing stand up
and you get a lot of them writing other

446
00:26:15,271 --> 00:26:15,630
shit.

447
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:18,570
You might write an email to somebody and
have a fucking great idea in the middle

448
00:26:18,571 --> 00:26:21,660
of just trying to be silly in an email
and you're like, Holy Shit, that's a bit,

449
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:24,490
and then take it and copy and paste it.
It's a bitch.

450
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,880
Just a matter of just being
in motion all the time.

451
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:28,860
View. Right. If let's
say you write 10 beds,

452
00:26:28,861 --> 00:26:33,510
how many do you think actually
make the act if out of worth it?

453
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:37,230
Yeah. There's a few that are
just like, what was that?

454
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:41,490
Go back over the notes and you're
like, the fuck was I thinking, man.

455
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:44,010
I tried to take everything that happens

456
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:45,330
and tries to turn it in.

457
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:48,240
I tried to turn into a bit and
then sometimes you're like,

458
00:26:48,241 --> 00:26:51,510
this is going to kill and you go
out there and it just flat lines.

459
00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:55,500
But I also get Bambi legs when I'm doing
new material, when I have material,

460
00:26:55,501 --> 00:26:57,330
I know that kills. I just, you know,

461
00:26:57,331 --> 00:27:01,920
I'm like for throwing like fucking
hammers of the God and then I get up there

462
00:27:01,921 --> 00:27:03,390
and I do this new bit and I,
it just like,

463
00:27:03,391 --> 00:27:06,870
I get the Bambi legs where my legs
start shaking and I thought I started

464
00:27:06,871 --> 00:27:10,890
dropping f bombs. I like every
other word is a fuck. Fuck, fuck.

465
00:27:10,891 --> 00:27:14,280
You can't let that happen. See,
you know what happens, right?

466
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:17,340
You know that that happens and you talk
about it, but you, you let it happen.

467
00:27:17,341 --> 00:27:21,480
You can never let that happen and
try not to never let it happen.

468
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:23,590
You just never let it happen.
It's not going to happen.

469
00:27:23,591 --> 00:27:26,480
It's just you could feel the energy
of just go. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

470
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:30,960
But when guys do that,
like you'll see guys like on the road,

471
00:27:30,961 --> 00:27:33,870
especially if you bring guys in the row
that has been on the road before and you

472
00:27:33,871 --> 00:27:36,450
see like the first time they
go on stage and you know,

473
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:39,240
fucking Fort Lauderdale or something
like that. That's so funny. Yeah,

474
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:42,700
that's happened to me. And a joke
doesn't go over well in the, in the,

475
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:46,980
the fuck's to start flying out. And what
it is is like they're saying, ah Yup.

476
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:49,530
They're like, it's a, the guy,

477
00:27:49,531 --> 00:27:53,790
a fucking guy with the fucking thing and
the audience does not want to hear that.

478
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:56,160
A poor use of words.

479
00:27:56,190 --> 00:28:00,210
You see that at the Hollywood improv a
lot because a lot of people think that's

480
00:28:00,211 --> 00:28:01,440
like the office.

481
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,560
That's where you go to work when
the industry is going to be there.

482
00:28:04,561 --> 00:28:08,490
And when you're young comic and it's
the first time he gets set there,

483
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:13,020
a lot of them put like this humongous
amount of pressure on themselves to do

484
00:28:13,021 --> 00:28:16,800
well there. And I've always felt
like as you move up to comedy chain,

485
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:20,920
I feel the gigs kind of get easier.
You know, you, you know the DA,

486
00:28:21,010 --> 00:28:24,210
the ticket price goes up and
as a ticket price goes up.

487
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,580
I always feel like people want to laugh.
They're like,

488
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:30,030
I'm dropping 50 bucks on this
ticket. I'm going to laugh. You know,

489
00:28:30,031 --> 00:28:34,150
I want to laugh. So, so people, at
least I couldn't disagree more real.

490
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:35,071
Yeah.

491
00:28:35,071 --> 00:28:38,550
Why would I don't understand why anybody
would be more inclined to laugh cause

492
00:28:38,551 --> 00:28:41,910
they paid a lot. They would love,
they want to have a good time.

493
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,170
Like if you're paying $50 compared to
going to show where it's like free comedy.

494
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:50,100
Okay. That's the difference. Because I
think that people who go free comedy,

495
00:28:50,101 --> 00:28:53,100
they could've done anything else. They're
not really there for comedy. Right.

496
00:28:53,101 --> 00:28:56,160
Someone pays for comedy, even if it's
10 bucks, you know, whatever it is.

497
00:28:56,550 --> 00:29:00,070
If they're paying for comedy, they're
going there to see a show. Right.

498
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:03,390
But there's a, there's a big difference
between that and like we paid 50 bucks.

499
00:29:03,391 --> 00:29:07,590
We're going to laugh hard. Right? I mean
I think it's the opposite really. Yes.

500
00:29:07,591 --> 00:29:08,970
When the ticket prices get high,

501
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:12,150
people do a little bit of this like
how much should I have to fucking pay?

502
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,280
There's guys out there that
charge 150 bucks a ticket.

503
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:18,660
I've seen those $50 a ticket. You know
there's like they have tiered seating,

504
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:19,660
like the seating in the front,

505
00:29:19,661 --> 00:29:23,550
it's like 200 bucks seating behind
that is 150 and you see people in that

506
00:29:23,551 --> 00:29:24,480
audience like this.

507
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:28,260
I was just in Pachangas Brian Regan's
playing there and I think it's like a,

508
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:32,790
he's like $110 but some of it's up there.
Oh Shit.

509
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:35,550
I pay that to see him.
He's hilarious I think is great.

510
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:37,800
You know we talked about
that on the podcast before,

511
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:41,770
but apparently we were incorrect
when was about Jay Leno,

512
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:44,740
so we should probably correct.
It's a good opportunity. The uh,

513
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:47,650
when you see the super high tickets,
those are actually scalpers.

514
00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:50,290
That's like ticket hub and shit like that.

515
00:29:50,291 --> 00:29:54,970
But this was an advertisement
on, yeah, tango. I understand.

516
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:58,780
But we were talking about Jay left and
we were quoting like $250 tickets and

517
00:29:58,781 --> 00:30:03,040
shit like that. Apparently his tickets are
not that expensive. It's just that, uh,

518
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:05,470
you know, scalpers. They exist.

519
00:30:05,890 --> 00:30:09,070
I've been doing his spots on Sunday
nights at the comedy Magic Club. Oh,

520
00:30:09,071 --> 00:30:11,110
he's not doing it anymore.
Well, he's on the road a lot,

521
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:14,020
so I do some of those some of the times
and he's not there. I'd do a spots.

522
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:15,161
That's great.

523
00:30:15,161 --> 00:30:19,300
I think you'll be in there
as great because it allows
it to a kind of shift the

524
00:30:19,301 --> 00:30:22,870
comedy a little bit when they were talking
about the differences in the crowds

525
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:25,570
between my crowds and Jay Leno's crowds.
It's pretty hilarious.

526
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:29,590
I think it's great, man. Well,
it's, it's a good spot, man.

527
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:32,650
I mean it's in the place has
been there for a long time,

528
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:36,640
but now chow and I'm there. Dude,
you owe the food. I chowed down.

529
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:38,050
That's a good club, man. I mean,

530
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:41,260
it's a club that's owned by a guy
who really has a love of comedy.

531
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:43,900
He's a great place. He, I
think he started that club.

532
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:48,220
I think he bought it in 1978 I don't
know if he started it or if he was the

533
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:52,260
first. I think he was the first, but
either way it's like a goddamn museums.

534
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:54,550
I'm blown that stinky shit in the air.
That's stuff's gross.

535
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:58,000
Slide love stinky man.
It's like,

536
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:01,120
it's like spraying perfume in
the air at Abercrombie and Fitch,

537
00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:05,620
which fucking gross. It smells
bad. You don't do those cigarettes.

538
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:10,340
I don't want to smell it.
It's fucking gross band.

539
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,520
Stop it some.

540
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:14,440
I saw some guy doing that at a restaurant
the other day and it was like it

541
00:31:14,441 --> 00:31:17,530
filled the room with this stinky
smoke or they're starting to band.

542
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:21,010
But I mean you could see it all over
the place and people are looking around

543
00:31:21,011 --> 00:31:24,430
like, is that smoke? Like what is
technically what the fuck is going on?

544
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:28,930
If I have to breathe your shit, we're in
a gray area. Yeah, but it's not illegal.

545
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:32,170
It's not legal and people are still
doing restaurants and then nobody,

546
00:31:32,171 --> 00:31:35,380
it's like if you lit up a cigar
in a restaurant, people go nuts.

547
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:38,260
They would fucking beat your ass.
Somebody would kick you out.

548
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:42,530
But this guy pulled one of these
things out and start puffing it in,

549
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:46,210
in a restaurant, and nobody did anything.
It was like this weird state of mind,

550
00:31:46,211 --> 00:31:47,980
like,
are we breathing it and smell it?

551
00:31:47,981 --> 00:31:52,060
Smells it had like a strawberry
smell to it or something icky. Yeah.

552
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:56,110
It isn't smoke though. It's
vapor, but I don't believe that.

553
00:31:56,380 --> 00:32:00,040
And it smells just vape shit to him. If
it's just vapor. Okay. You tell me this.

554
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:03,040
What's the difference between you and
hailing that vapor and me and hailing that

555
00:32:03,041 --> 00:32:06,760
vapor. It's going into your
body and you're blowing it out.

556
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:11,740
So inside when you're doing that,
it's transporting the t the nicotine.

557
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:13,360
So when it goes out into the air,

558
00:32:13,361 --> 00:32:17,530
isn't it also transporting at
least some of the nicotine? Uh,

559
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:20,740
it has to be. It is. It's
so small and it's nicotine.

560
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:22,990
It doesn't matter if you're
forced to that, but what?

561
00:32:22,991 --> 00:32:25,830
You can't say that because you're,
you're asking other people to in the,

562
00:32:25,831 --> 00:32:30,610
in gesture nicotine. That's
the whole purpose of making
secondhand smoke illegal.

563
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:34,340
I think it's so smart that it will,
you won't even feel any,

564
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,310
shouldn't be anything.
It should be zero,

565
00:32:36,311 --> 00:32:39,560
should be zero amount of drugs that you
could put in the air that affect other

566
00:32:39,561 --> 00:32:42,710
people. That's not something we have
to deal with. We don't do that as a,

567
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,590
let me guess. We do. I was going to
say we don't do it with our bodies,

568
00:32:45,591 --> 00:32:48,560
but I guess some checks give off a fuck
the purchase volume or like when you're

569
00:32:48,561 --> 00:32:53,330
in a mall and you go buy a can like a
Yankee that's way worse. Not like perfume.

570
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:56,900
It's not like perfume. You're actually
breathing in. I see it in the air.

571
00:32:56,930 --> 00:33:00,320
It's like when you blow that thing
out, I can see it. It's a fog machine.

572
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:04,340
I don't believe that. I
don't believe that. I think
there's some of them that are,

573
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:07,340
but I think some of them, man,
that shit lingers. Like smoke.

574
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:10,090
Like there's some that
you see it like the plot.

575
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:13,250
It blows out and within seconds it's gone.
It just disappears.

576
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:17,120
But there's other ones that float around
in the air and that's the thing they're

577
00:33:17,121 --> 00:33:19,040
saying about these e-cigarettes.
They're saying, look,

578
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:23,540
they're absolutely better for you
than regular cigarettes. Cigarettes,

579
00:33:23,541 --> 00:33:24,890
health experts are saying this.

580
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:28,580
But what they're not saying
is all e-cigarettes are equal.

581
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:32,150
And what they're not saying is that
all cigarettes that are, you know,

582
00:33:32,151 --> 00:33:36,350
using these little electronic mechanisms
have the same mechanism that they act

583
00:33:36,351 --> 00:33:39,830
in the same way. So when you see
what looks like fucking smoke,

584
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:44,390
you're seeing a guy who
burned some tobacco oil. Yup.
I mean that's what it is.

585
00:33:44,391 --> 00:33:47,870
It might not be plant matter.
It might be just the oil,

586
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,280
but I feel like it's smoke.

587
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:52,940
There's no regulated standards that
everybody must have the same thing. Yeah.

588
00:33:52,941 --> 00:33:56,090
I'm not sure enough to
really discuss the wild west,

589
00:33:56,091 --> 00:33:59,810
but what I've understood by
listening to people talk about it,

590
00:33:59,811 --> 00:34:03,830
this is the standards are very different.
Like, like you can get like one,

591
00:34:03,831 --> 00:34:06,950
like a blue e-cigarette.
Like if somebody had a blue in this room,

592
00:34:06,951 --> 00:34:10,580
there's smoking in.
I'm pretty sure that is just vapor.

593
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:11,840
Like that's all you're getting.

594
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:13,970
You're inhaling this thing and
you're puffing out just vapor,

595
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:16,930
but when you buy one of those
fucking fire hydrant looking bitch,

596
00:34:16,931 --> 00:34:21,170
it's like Rosanne has those light
sabers with a two bucks thing.

597
00:34:21,171 --> 00:34:23,570
One of those flute things that,
what are those things called?

598
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:26,960
Those like a flute w when
you suck on the end of it,

599
00:34:26,961 --> 00:34:31,070
what would the the mouthpiece called?
Fluke. Oh yeah. Fluke. Now that's a fish.

600
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:35,780
This thing, a fluke. F
L. U. K E is a fish. Oh,

601
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:39,530
well maybe it's a fluke in it. That's
she had a mouth. I thought it was,

602
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,480
this could be, look it
up. All right. Here.

603
00:34:41,570 --> 00:34:46,340
I thought it was a flute
wasn't a flew f l u e flute.

604
00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:50,770
That that was a fluke. But isn't that a
part of like a musical instrument? Yeah,

605
00:34:50,850 --> 00:34:53,500
I fell you e. Yeah, and I think
that's what it, that's why the call,

606
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:55,310
same thing because it's like,
well that's why we

607
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:00,430
googled times.
That little thing you put in like a,

608
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:03,560
that little thing would be to put
on the end of a wooden instrument.

609
00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:06,500
It's also hot dog joint.
You're read it flew keys,

610
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:11,060
the many different words of the
English language. Um, well, okay.

611
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:15,040
The flying, the Flying Fluke, um,

612
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:19,310
the part of an anchor
that catches the ground,

613
00:35:19,311 --> 00:35:23,300
especially in the triangular
piece at the end of an,

614
00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:26,820
of the end of each arm.
Hmm.

615
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:32,960
Under anchor a Barb or a
barbed head of a harpoon,

616
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:38,220
a spear Arrow or the like,
and either half of the triangular

617
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:42,960
tale of a whale. Okay. There's
another, um, there's an accidental,

618
00:35:42,961 --> 00:35:45,510
like there's a fluke,
like it was a fluke victory.

619
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:49,920
That's one that was a fluke or an
accident or chance happening. Uh,

620
00:35:49,921 --> 00:35:54,660
an accidental accidentally successful
stroke such as in billiards.

621
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:59,430
It's a fluke shot and billiards.
They say, uh, obscure origin.

622
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:05,100
Okay. Fluke. Like a guess. All
right. Any of several flute.

623
00:36:05,101 --> 00:36:08,400
Perry, no. American flounders.

624
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:11,730
I used to catch those when we lived
in Massachusetts. Just catch a summer.

625
00:36:11,731 --> 00:36:15,630
Flounders they're called flukes
and uh,

626
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:20,640
any of a variety of other flatfishes no,
it doesn't say that.

627
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:24,870
Now let's look up flu. Flou he, cause
I think that's what we're thinking of.

628
00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:27,240
Oh,
I might be wrong about that too.

629
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:32,520
Flu is a passage or duct for smoke
booth chimney. So it's a flu.

630
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,030
It's not a fluke.
You fuck heads ruined the whole thing.

631
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:40,140
And he ducked our passage for air gas
or the like. So it has to be that,

632
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:43,830
you know what I've found man,
you know, uh, those uh, you know,

633
00:36:43,831 --> 00:36:47,220
green mountain grills, they make those
pellet grills, they make appellate,

634
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:49,320
not green mountain grills,
but other companies,

635
00:36:49,321 --> 00:36:52,530
they make pellet smokers really
well. You can do like, you know,

636
00:36:52,531 --> 00:36:55,290
you go to the barbecue, like I've been
looking up the smokers man, you know,

637
00:36:55,291 --> 00:36:59,190
because I did that smokey thing with
the ham. My smokers kind of wack.

638
00:36:59,430 --> 00:37:01,020
It fell over in the wind,

639
00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:04,830
the wind knocked it over and it's
all fucked up now I'm like, hmm.

640
00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:06,550
I mean it worked fine for the mom,

641
00:37:06,551 --> 00:37:09,930
but it was kind of a pain that Dick like
you had to get up every couple hours

642
00:37:09,931 --> 00:37:11,580
and stick a wood chips in it.

643
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:15,270
I thought it would be more
self contained in that,

644
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:17,880
but they have these things like green
mountain grills or you know the green

645
00:37:17,881 --> 00:37:21,330
mountain grows a pellet smoker
or its appellate cooker. Um,

646
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:25,050
but they have pellet smokers to that
work like in a kind of a different way.

647
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:28,650
It's more smoke than it is just the
heat from burning the pellets I guess.

648
00:37:29,310 --> 00:37:31,530
But you could make ribs and shit on them.

649
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:32,360
Yeah.
When,

650
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:35,620
when Joey Diaz says that he got the meat
sweats because I got it the other day

651
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:40,690
from eating meat for eating meat
ribs. Uh, what is that from?

652
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:41,740
Because I mean it was serious.

653
00:37:41,741 --> 00:37:43,750
Like I thought it was having a heart
attack after eating cause I was,

654
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:46,020
I was getting hot and then shaky and then

655
00:37:46,270 --> 00:37:48,750
your body's just trying to
burn off all that extra flesh.

656
00:37:48,751 --> 00:37:52,210
He just stuffed on your law. I mean
that's what it is. Your body's just going,

657
00:37:52,211 --> 00:37:54,730
Holy Shit.
We aid a Fogo de Chao

658
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:59,120
eddies match with boiler and
we were sweating like crazy.

659
00:38:00,450 --> 00:38:02,620
Just dig in when you eat a lot of meat.

660
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:03,880
I love it.

661
00:38:03,881 --> 00:38:06,640
I take one of those things where I'm
driving by the hospital in Burbank and I'm

662
00:38:06,641 --> 00:38:09,430
like, should I just like pull over and
just wait and wait this out to make sure I

663
00:38:09,431 --> 00:38:14,110
don't need to be there soon.
We thinking you were dying.

664
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:17,980
It felt something was not right, man.
I, I felt like I was something was up.

665
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:19,360
Are you worried about your health?

666
00:38:19,361 --> 00:38:21,350
Is that why you go into
the electronic cigarettes?

667
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:22,840
You just doing this because
you were in the studio?

668
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:27,660
No, I I I mostly do electronic cigarette
cause the girl, she'd only do it.

669
00:38:27,690 --> 00:38:30,930
The girl I'm with hates it so much.
So I have good, good for her. Good.

670
00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:35,950
What does she hate more your
cigarettes or your a hand job places.

671
00:38:36,050 --> 00:38:40,630
I know. Shh. Jesus. Sam,
you are spell it out.

672
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:45,040
No denial.
You fucking cock blocker.

673
00:38:45,770 --> 00:38:50,240
Yeah.
Well let me have Sam said the robot.

674
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:52,413
Hey listen,

675
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:57,700
uh, Sam Shabbily knows what you
do. He always does that shit man.

676
00:38:57,701 --> 00:39:00,480
There's been so many times for Sam
has said something where I'm like,

677
00:39:00,481 --> 00:39:01,790
you're fucking,
what are you shooting?

678
00:39:01,890 --> 00:39:05,950
Like trip
out maps.

679
00:39:06,730 --> 00:39:09,910
What are you talking about?
Interesting guy.

680
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:14,020
You'll get mad at me all the time for
just bringing up something you talk about

681
00:39:14,021 --> 00:39:15,500
onstage.
He's got a big,

682
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:20,350
like everybody mad at me
on Twitter because it's
something that I just literally

683
00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:22,240
just was like, Hey, did you
see write back and say this?

684
00:39:22,241 --> 00:39:26,980
And then at the firestorm breaks out.
Not think she's on Twitter.

685
00:39:26,981 --> 00:39:31,060
She's like a social media person.
It's so weird.

686
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:36,280
I know. I'm out of shape. No Way. Because
I was running one day in La Jolla.

687
00:39:36,610 --> 00:39:41,230
People randomly started cheering me
on as I was running down the street.

688
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:45,790
Guys on bikes were giving me high
fives and thumbs up. I was like,

689
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:50,000
dude, I'm just running. This isn't
like a fucking marathon. Yes. You

690
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,910
know that they didn't see you
perform at the comedy store there.

691
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:54,350
That's right next to La Jolla.

692
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:58,220
Or maybe it was so funny seeing your boobs
that they were like, yeah, how honey,

693
00:39:58,270 --> 00:40:01,100
you know hog called.
Why would you assume?

694
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,780
Why wouldn't you assume
that they knew who you were?

695
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,550
You were performing in that fucking town.

696
00:40:04,850 --> 00:40:08,620
How many people do you think are in
La Jolla? I know, but it was in PB.

697
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:12,680
I know it's the same basic place, but
nobody knows for. How long ago was this?

698
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:16,880
This was like a couple of weeks ago. Sam
Tripoli. You're internet famous in a way,

699
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:20,690
you know that, right? Do you have a
fucking CD? That's number 11 on it.

700
00:40:21,110 --> 00:40:24,050
Believe in yourself. Yeah, but I mean
seriously stop and think about that.

701
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:27,320
What are you confused that people would
like give you the thumbs up if they

702
00:40:27,321 --> 00:40:31,130
think you're funny? Yeah, I do, but I
just feel it himself down. Sam triply.

703
00:40:31,970 --> 00:40:36,350
Yes. I'm the, I'm the, I'm the house of
self doubt. That's where I come from. Yes,

704
00:40:36,351 --> 00:40:37,250
I do have self doubt,

705
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:42,230
but I really had to think it more has
to do with me looking like I'm barely

706
00:40:42,231 --> 00:40:44,750
holding on as I run.
Well there's a little of that,

707
00:40:44,751 --> 00:40:46,700
but I'm trying to give you a fucking half,

708
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:50,570
half glass full option and you're not
even willing to take it at some defeatist

709
00:40:50,571 --> 00:40:52,670
type thinking. Sam, I don't know why.

710
00:40:52,671 --> 00:40:56,360
I just have a feeling as more to do
with the running kind of rocking cause

711
00:40:56,361 --> 00:40:59,900
you're trying to work in your material
about running and people getting true at

712
00:40:59,901 --> 00:41:02,840
all. Working in a bed. Come on. Okay.

713
00:41:02,841 --> 00:41:07,640
There's a bit of a bear. A little bit
of a little, a bit of a something there.

714
00:41:07,641 --> 00:41:12,020
I know I can ramble with Pacific beach.
It's fucking beautiful isn't it?

715
00:41:12,050 --> 00:41:14,060
It's gorgeous. I don't know why. I like,

716
00:41:14,061 --> 00:41:17,690
why would you live in Cleveland
when you could live in PB?

717
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:19,160
People get stuck.

718
00:41:19,190 --> 00:41:22,460
They don't have enough money to move in
the hairy scary to try to relocate to a

719
00:41:22,461 --> 00:41:23,150
new spot.

720
00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:27,350
I would smoke a ton of crack that way I
wouldn't have to eat for like two weeks

721
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:32,620
and I just save all my money for
a great crack grows on trees.

722
00:41:33,350 --> 00:41:34,070
A gray,
I

723
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:37,340
mean give it a crack bullish on the
corner. I mean cracked. He grown trees.

724
00:41:37,690 --> 00:41:40,160
It'll put crack dealers at a
business but everybody be on crack.

725
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:42,710
Everybody would be imagine if
that was like a real issue.

726
00:41:42,711 --> 00:41:45,470
Like crack was just growing everywhere.
A lot of people in trees.

727
00:41:46,610 --> 00:41:47,930
There'll be a lot of people that are dead.

728
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:52,270
This is a joke on my CD.
I was walking my dog next door.

729
00:41:52,271 --> 00:41:55,480
I've crackheads everywhere. I was
walking my dog, I looked in the trees,

730
00:41:55,510 --> 00:41:58,250
there were crack heads in the trees.
That's a true story.

731
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:03,010
They were hanging up out there and there's
like five Prac gets in these trees.

732
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:04,910
That's, you know, you got good crack.

733
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:08,840
It's like if you go buy a pasture
and you see big fat, healthy cows,

734
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:13,030
that's some good grass. Those, those
cows are eating good. But if you, uh,

735
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:14,810
if you see a crack head up in a tree,

736
00:42:14,930 --> 00:42:17,110
did you see the one nearby
has some really good,

737
00:42:17,530 --> 00:42:18,580
do you see the video of the,

738
00:42:18,730 --> 00:42:23,300
the jazz band playing jazz and the cows
just all walk up and start listening to

739
00:42:23,350 --> 00:42:25,370
the band jam. Really? Yeah.

740
00:42:25,371 --> 00:42:28,760
And it was like the co they have to pull
over and take a piss and guys starts

741
00:42:28,761 --> 00:42:30,350
playing his thing and all the cows,

742
00:42:30,351 --> 00:42:33,740
you start looking and then you see them
walk over and they start listening to

743
00:42:33,741 --> 00:42:34,410
the band.

744
00:42:34,410 --> 00:42:37,650
That's so cool. Cows than people. I'm
such a fascinating relationship, man.

745
00:42:38,130 --> 00:42:40,560
That's a weird thing. Yeah.
We eat them. We'll need,

746
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:44,370
we don't just eat them like
very, very, very, very, very,

747
00:42:44,371 --> 00:42:47,310
very few people have them as pets,
you know,

748
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:48,750
and the people that do have them as pets,

749
00:42:48,751 --> 00:42:51,690
they usually get something out
of them like milk. Yeah, welcome.

750
00:42:52,290 --> 00:42:56,790
And then the big male ones, boy, not
really interested in being your friend.

751
00:42:57,060 --> 00:42:59,160
You've got to keep them in
the fuck away from people.

752
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:03,540
You got to cut their balls off at an
early age and those are the ones you cook.

753
00:43:03,630 --> 00:43:06,300
Yup. You make your, your dairy.

754
00:43:06,301 --> 00:43:10,860
I've won a fucking weird relationship
that these animals have somehow or another

755
00:43:10,861 --> 00:43:15,861
like sort of developed and been groomed
to develop to be these docile giants

756
00:43:16,561 --> 00:43:20,310
that we just pick meat from.
So strange.

757
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:24,840
I mean we've accepted it because it's
normal. But if, if human beings, the,

758
00:43:24,850 --> 00:43:29,600
if the concept of eating other animals
didn't exist and then, you know,

759
00:43:29,750 --> 00:43:31,980
we started introducing the idea,

760
00:43:31,981 --> 00:43:36,150
we found a better way to get
our protein then beans. In fact,

761
00:43:36,151 --> 00:43:41,010
if you eat animals, animal protein
is high in omega three fatty acids.

762
00:43:41,011 --> 00:43:44,920
And we started extolling the
virtues of murdering cows and Edm

763
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,480
people will be like, what the fuck are
you talking? What are you crazy man?

764
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:51,540
Eat animals flipped the
fuck you going to eat him.

765
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:55,850
But because we eat animals all the time,
it's just no big deal.

766
00:43:55,860 --> 00:44:00,470
They acceptables totally murders fine.
Well and we just have this thing.

767
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:03,350
Well you know animals eat animals
and fucking they would eat us,

768
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:06,440
which is totally true. Yes
they would. But it's weird.

769
00:44:06,530 --> 00:44:09,470
What I'm getting at is it's weird and it
goes back to what we were talking about

770
00:44:09,471 --> 00:44:13,670
about living in Edmonton, cause it's
weird what people just get used to.

771
00:44:14,030 --> 00:44:16,310
It's weird that people
get used to 50 below zero.

772
00:44:16,340 --> 00:44:19,700
It's weird that people get used to
plowing themselves out of the driveway

773
00:44:19,701 --> 00:44:22,260
everyday because it snowed a foot and a
half over night while they were asleep.

774
00:44:22,261 --> 00:44:25,520
And so they have to get up two hours
early just so they can get out of their

775
00:44:25,521 --> 00:44:28,910
fucking driveway and drive down that
slippery road to a job. That sucks.

776
00:44:29,150 --> 00:44:31,040
But people do it.
They just fucking do it.

777
00:44:31,130 --> 00:44:34,590
They just accept it, they accept it,
and she's like, this is my reality.

778
00:44:34,650 --> 00:44:38,910
Cold as fuck. Even prison. That's
where it gets really weird, man.

779
00:44:39,090 --> 00:44:41,100
People except their prison reality.

780
00:44:41,310 --> 00:44:44,100
That's why they say that men
become institutionalized.

781
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:48,270
Like I guess women as well.
Probably right. If they're
locked up for a long time,

782
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:51,630
they become used to the
community and the, uh, the,

783
00:44:51,631 --> 00:44:55,440
the social schedule schedule,
they get used to that world.

784
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:57,090
And when I say the community,
I don't see it. It's like,

785
00:44:57,091 --> 00:45:01,140
it's fucking great community. Great
NBC show. No, I don't mean that either.

786
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:04,530
What I meant was that it's like they
get used to that sort of structure.

787
00:45:04,531 --> 00:45:05,790
That's social structure.

788
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:09,240
They get used to that world and they're
scared and when they get, they get free,

789
00:45:09,241 --> 00:45:12,030
they'll commit like some stupid
little crime to get locked up.

790
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:15,300
Nobody gets hurt so they get sent back.
Yeah. That definitely does happen.

791
00:45:15,390 --> 00:45:18,510
There's a guy of the option,
I think stay in. Look,

792
00:45:18,511 --> 00:45:22,200
I think if someone's gotten you to
the point where you're so fucked up,

793
00:45:22,201 --> 00:45:24,540
you want to stay in prison
and you don't want to be free,

794
00:45:24,630 --> 00:45:28,860
or if you are so fucked up and you
have the, the ability to recognize it,

795
00:45:29,130 --> 00:45:31,770
you know, like if you're a child
molester or something along those lines,

796
00:45:32,070 --> 00:45:33,750
which you know,

797
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:37,770
take away from the horrific act of
what molesting a child is fucking

798
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:42,930
unbelievably evil, disgusting,
disgusting and evil. But imagine,

799
00:45:43,110 --> 00:45:47,880
I don't understand like some people's
motivations for things. I don't, I don't,

800
00:45:47,881 --> 00:45:50,370
I don't, I'm not inside their
head. I could speculate,

801
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:55,170
but I really couldn't imagine what it's
like to be a child molester. Somewhat.

802
00:45:55,171 --> 00:45:59,970
Obviously can, could you imagine being
a person who does not want that in them?

803
00:46:00,170 --> 00:46:03,970
It does not want that, that
whatever the fuck it is that, that,

804
00:46:03,980 --> 00:46:06,000
that aberration,
that fuck up,

805
00:46:06,001 --> 00:46:10,800
that horrible left turn in their mind
that makes them want to molests kids.

806
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:14,040
But it's there. And so, you know what? If
one of them was like, you know what, man,

807
00:46:14,041 --> 00:46:15,750
don't let me out just to leave me in here.

808
00:46:15,990 --> 00:46:18,750
I think in here I'm having a good
life or they're good enough life.

809
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:22,470
There was a story about a guy who
infected women with HIV and he,

810
00:46:22,471 --> 00:46:25,760
he had infected a bunch
of them because he said,

811
00:46:26,010 --> 00:46:30,300
because he didn't believe he had it.
He thought it was bs and he's just him.

812
00:46:30,301 --> 00:46:32,910
Tommy Morrison. Toni Morrison
was saying that. Remember,

813
00:46:33,210 --> 00:46:36,210
but he went to jail and this guy,
they wouldn't let him out.

814
00:46:36,510 --> 00:46:39,510
They kept him in jail for longer till
they figured out what they were going to

815
00:46:39,511 --> 00:46:41,040
do with them.
What can you do?

816
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:44,890
How can you stop someone from giving
a disease and how can you, you know,

817
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:48,930
just you have it, dude. You got it. You
can't give it to other people. Yeah.

818
00:46:48,931 --> 00:46:52,410
I mean people have been giving people the
clap from the beginning of time. Right.

819
00:46:52,411 --> 00:46:55,500
You know, I mean, how many
fucking people have chlamydia? No,

820
00:46:55,501 --> 00:46:58,680
they have chlamydia and still go
out and fuck, that's gotta be rough.

821
00:46:58,700 --> 00:47:01,530
It was rough. But then they
would do it with aids to man.

822
00:47:01,531 --> 00:47:04,170
People do with everything.
There's obviously they, you know,

823
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:08,400
obviously people do give it up
because it gets spread around. Right.

824
00:47:08,401 --> 00:47:12,750
Well how about this fucking magic
Johnson Donald Sterling thing,

825
00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:17,430
this, this whole thing like a part of
his whole thing that a lot of people are

826
00:47:17,431 --> 00:47:22,410
ignoring was her and the guide sterling
and her having this conversation where

827
00:47:22,470 --> 00:47:25,500
he was saying, you can go
fuck these guys. He was like,

828
00:47:25,501 --> 00:47:29,260
I don't care what you do with them.
Fuck 'em go out. You know, fuck them.

829
00:47:29,650 --> 00:47:32,320
Like you're, you're hanging out
magic. Wait a minute, hold on. Well,

830
00:47:32,321 --> 00:47:33,820
he even said that he,

831
00:47:33,821 --> 00:47:38,500
I said that in the Anderson Cooper
interview that this guy was going around

832
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:41,830
having sex with people
when he knew had HIV. Yeah.

833
00:47:41,831 --> 00:47:45,250
He said that in the Anderson Cooper
thing and I'd heard that before.

834
00:47:45,750 --> 00:47:46,660
We'd probably does.

835
00:47:47,190 --> 00:47:51,490
But what's crazy is that it's
just like everything else.

836
00:47:51,670 --> 00:47:55,420
It's just like having plumbing Ia. It's
just like having herpes. It's just like,

837
00:47:55,660 --> 00:47:58,090
like people don't think of HIV,

838
00:47:58,091 --> 00:48:01,570
which can be potentially fatal.
I mean,

839
00:48:01,571 --> 00:48:04,690
I guess less fatal now that
they have a lot more drugs.

840
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:08,010
I think eventually it's just
going to be like diabetes almost,

841
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:10,870
but you can give it to somebody. I think
that's where it got an hourly thing.

842
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:15,210
Drugs for it forever. They ever
kind of wore it. I think lover,

843
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:18,520
I think what they should do is
whoever's got billion dollars go,

844
00:48:18,521 --> 00:48:22,300
this is $1 billion. You need a
lot more than that to secure it.

845
00:48:23,050 --> 00:48:26,170
If you like to have scientists
that can have this billion dollars,

846
00:48:26,171 --> 00:48:30,710
if he could cure it. No, it's, it doesn't
matter you the funding in order to, uh,

847
00:48:30,790 --> 00:48:35,790
to make a drug that's capable of doing
something as incredible as curing HIV or

848
00:48:36,401 --> 00:48:41,170
curing aids. I mean right now they've
got them apparently now again,

849
00:48:41,470 --> 00:48:42,550
when I'm discussing this,

850
00:48:42,610 --> 00:48:47,610
I have zero medical background or just
two dudes talk to idiots that happened to

851
00:48:47,651 --> 00:48:50,430
be dirty and smarter than the other,
but we don't have,

852
00:48:50,431 --> 00:48:53,800
I don't know who the fuck is up tomorrow.
Leave it out there. You know, big words.

853
00:48:53,801 --> 00:48:55,960
I'm sure. I know it does
it. I'm saying it again.

854
00:48:56,050 --> 00:48:59,440
It's just the words that they use,
actual mechanism behind the smart.

855
00:48:59,470 --> 00:49:03,940
It's very debatable, but the
look, the bottom line is,

856
00:49:04,870 --> 00:49:07,570
I don't know shit about
medical science at all,

857
00:49:07,630 --> 00:49:12,550
so anything that I say about
a, about what's, what's good
for you and bad for you,

858
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:15,100
it's just fucking pure speculation.
However,

859
00:49:15,310 --> 00:49:19,270
what I understand is that they've got
it down to a point where you don't even

860
00:49:19,271 --> 00:49:22,870
test positive for HIV anymore.
Like you.

861
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:24,790
They've had people that are HIV positive,

862
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:30,000
but the drug goes into such remote places
and squashes out the virus in such a

863
00:49:31,091 --> 00:49:35,480
way that even though you still have
it, it's like, and you could shut it.

864
00:49:35,950 --> 00:49:39,250
I don't know. That's the question. I don't
know. None of it makes any sense to me.

865
00:49:39,251 --> 00:49:43,280
It's chaos, but viruses don't
make any sense to me. Bacteria,

866
00:49:43,281 --> 00:49:44,140
it doesn't make any sense to me.

867
00:49:44,141 --> 00:49:47,560
The fact that you need bacteria
makes no fucking sense to me.

868
00:49:47,610 --> 00:49:52,300
Can like a virus. It lives forever.
That's a good question. Some of them,

869
00:49:52,301 --> 00:49:55,090
they've eradicated and they've come back.
You know, like some of them they got,

870
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:58,090
well, that's one of the things that people
get so upset about with anti vaccine

871
00:49:58,091 --> 00:49:59,050
people.
It's like,

872
00:49:59,051 --> 00:50:04,000
do you understand that they have taken
shit like polio and made it almost

873
00:50:04,010 --> 00:50:05,290
nonexistent?

874
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:09,790
They've taken things like smallpox
and made them almost nonexistent.

875
00:50:10,390 --> 00:50:15,040
What about this mers or mar immerse
takers like has that always been around or

876
00:50:15,041 --> 00:50:17,800
is that just like something comes out of
nowhere and they ain't got to be like,

877
00:50:17,890 --> 00:50:22,750
oh, it was the Middle East thing. How
much is this manmade? You know, like,

878
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:27,770
well, don't get crazy. I will. All that
is the thing that people do do this.

879
00:50:27,771 --> 00:50:32,570
I do have a a little bit of information
about this because I did a whole special

880
00:50:32,571 --> 00:50:36,650
on it on that Scifi show on infectious
diseases and I got a chance to talk to a

881
00:50:36,651 --> 00:50:39,440
lot of these guys.
They're not making any new diseases.

882
00:50:39,470 --> 00:50:41,360
They don't have to make any new diseases.

883
00:50:41,510 --> 00:50:45,710
They have some shit weaponized
smallpox that if they released,

884
00:50:46,430 --> 00:50:48,080
we're Foxville.
Yeah,

885
00:50:48,110 --> 00:50:51,980
they had this stuff in mass quantities
in Russia and that's a fact.

886
00:50:52,130 --> 00:50:54,680
There's no need to make
any new thing like mers.

887
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:58,100
Mers is not very effective because look,
it's not spreading.

888
00:50:58,260 --> 00:51:01,340
There's a very small amount of people
have gotten and they were talking about it

889
00:51:01,341 --> 00:51:05,300
years ago. It's a very dangerous and
deadly disease once people get it,

890
00:51:05,330 --> 00:51:08,180
but there's not that many people
that have it. It's a very small,

891
00:51:08,181 --> 00:51:10,370
I only think like six people
ever have died from it.

892
00:51:10,580 --> 00:51:15,290
The problem is it's like half the people
that get it. It's, it's just bird flu.

893
00:51:15,291 --> 00:51:18,200
New Bird flu is not new.
All of these fluids.

894
00:51:18,201 --> 00:51:19,790
This is another thing that
I found out during the show.

895
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,510
They're almost all of
them come from livestock,

896
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:28,250
whether it's a swine flu, whether
it's the avian flu, bird flu,

897
00:51:28,251 --> 00:51:33,200
all these different flu's a shit ton
of them come from the way people raise

898
00:51:33,201 --> 00:51:37,580
animals in factory to make love
to them. No. Okay. That's up.

899
00:51:37,581 --> 00:51:40,980
There was a lot of fucking, and
that was the aids one. The monkey,

900
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:42,640
Sam Kennison.

901
00:51:45,260 --> 00:51:49,430
Yeah, that Sam kinisons
bit UN aids. It was like,

902
00:51:49,790 --> 00:51:52,730
at the time it was so taboo and so wrong,

903
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:56,030
but there's so much of it that
was so fucking true and funny.

904
00:51:56,630 --> 00:51:58,800
The thing that we're used
to like, you know, he's like

905
00:51:58,980 --> 00:52:02,550
Sam, they say Sam, Hey,
just a heterosexual disease.

906
00:52:03,210 --> 00:52:07,610
Straight people die from it.
Do they want fucking guy?

907
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:09,760
Fuck you.
It's not our,

908
00:52:12,270 --> 00:52:14,600
it's not our fucking dance.

909
00:52:16,270 --> 00:52:20,230
That's a horrible joke.
Terrible. And mean.

910
00:52:20,260 --> 00:52:22,750
Who is someone's talking
about? Right. They were,

911
00:52:22,970 --> 00:52:27,040
they went back and they watch Eddie
Murphy's like delirious or raw, I forgot.

912
00:52:27,340 --> 00:52:31,600
And they were watching it with their kids
and then at some point you had to stop

913
00:52:31,601 --> 00:52:32,051
and go,
listen,

914
00:52:32,051 --> 00:52:36,790
we don't talk like this anymore because
it was like very raw and obviously not

915
00:52:36,791 --> 00:52:37,624
just raw,

916
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:42,840
like the difference between like a gay
joke and an evil like homophobic joke.

917
00:52:45,340 --> 00:52:49,030
There's a difference in, they used to
that what used to be pretty normal,

918
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:53,110
like an evil, homophobic joke
in the 80s was pretty normal.

919
00:52:53,530 --> 00:52:57,760
Like you could get away with it. Yeah.
You know, and now it's like, whoa.

920
00:52:57,790 --> 00:53:02,520
It's like you can't just shit on someone
just for their sexual orientation. Yeah.

921
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:05,890
It's gotta be an observation of it.
I mean, what is the line on that?

922
00:53:05,891 --> 00:53:09,520
Because I feel like some people
think that if you just bring it up,

923
00:53:09,550 --> 00:53:13,170
it's homophobic and I just completely
disagree with that. Yes, that's,

924
00:53:13,390 --> 00:53:18,390
I agree with you 100% that the subjects
are always going to be completely open.

925
00:53:19,511 --> 00:53:22,300
You can talk about
anything you want on stage.

926
00:53:22,390 --> 00:53:24,370
People may or may not find it funny.

927
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:29,400
There's the question is do you find it
funny and can you find a way to relay it

928
00:53:29,401 --> 00:53:32,940
to an audience? If that's your
intent. Just finding humor in life.

929
00:53:33,090 --> 00:53:35,130
There's nothing wrong with
that. And you can, you know,

930
00:53:35,131 --> 00:53:36,900
you could talk about any subject you want,

931
00:53:37,350 --> 00:53:41,340
but that's not what they were doing
back then. They were just destroying,

932
00:53:41,970 --> 00:53:43,770
destroying gay people.
You know,

933
00:53:43,771 --> 00:53:47,640
you remember when US Sebastian Bach
from skid row had a t shirt on.

934
00:53:48,060 --> 00:53:52,230
AIDS kills fags dead. Yeah,
man. You could find it.

935
00:53:52,260 --> 00:53:55,170
Pull up the picture. It was a
huge controversy, but it's like,

936
00:53:55,171 --> 00:53:56,580
why would you say that?

937
00:53:56,850 --> 00:54:01,350
It's so weird that is as
homophobic as you can get.

938
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:04,860
It's probably the worst it, well, it's
just right up there with God hates fags.

939
00:54:04,861 --> 00:54:07,080
That, uh, Phelps guy that died recently

940
00:54:08,940 --> 00:54:12,570
walking around with a shirt on like that.
Like someone thought that was cool.

941
00:54:12,571 --> 00:54:14,970
It's cooler than not wearing that shirt.
There it is.

942
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:21,060
Is there irony loss in the way he's
pouting with his gay lips and his fucking

943
00:54:21,061 --> 00:54:26,061
Farrah Fawcett hair and just that whole
loop of that music genre was all dudes

944
00:54:26,341 --> 00:54:27,910
who tried to look like chicks.
Yeah.

945
00:54:28,190 --> 00:54:30,570
You remember when you first saw
the poisoned CD, you're like,

946
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:34,560
those are some smoking hot chicks and
your friend's like, dude, those are, Gosh.

947
00:54:34,561 --> 00:54:38,530
You're like, ah, I want weird.
What a weird time in music, man. I,

948
00:54:38,531 --> 00:54:43,531
I blame Rob Halford Cause Rob Halford
of Judas priest who was gay as fuck and

949
00:54:43,621 --> 00:54:47,190
coolest shit all around bad motherfucker.
He,

950
00:54:47,430 --> 00:54:52,430
he's such a bad mother fucker that he
was wearing like obvious gay biker garb

951
00:54:52,890 --> 00:54:56,010
and he got people to
think that gay biker garb,

952
00:54:56,011 --> 00:54:59,880
like onstage with
something cool manly shit.

953
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:02,560
And because he was sort of closeted,
you know,

954
00:55:02,650 --> 00:55:05,790
I guess it was understood in the industry,
but they didn't talk about it,

955
00:55:05,791 --> 00:55:09,180
but he didn't hide it. You know, it's one
of those things. It wasn't like Liberace,

956
00:55:09,270 --> 00:55:09,541
you know,

957
00:55:09,541 --> 00:55:12,540
back in the just flaming constantly ask
him when he was going to get married.

958
00:55:12,541 --> 00:55:16,120
It was, it was a different sort of
a scenario but rob Halford, God,

959
00:55:16,140 --> 00:55:19,140
he changed like metal.
They all started dressing like that.

960
00:55:19,141 --> 00:55:23,100
They all started dressing like gay
bikers and I think that during that time

961
00:55:23,430 --> 00:55:26,780
everybody got so perplexed.
I think bad gay motherfuckers,

962
00:55:26,790 --> 00:55:31,790
just bad ass gay dudes infiltrated the
music business and got everyone to dress

963
00:55:32,191 --> 00:55:33,720
like a homeowner. Yeah, they all,

964
00:55:33,721 --> 00:55:38,490
everyone was wearing spandex tights and
their cock was pin there to pick up.

965
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:42,540
Everybody looked like that's not,
but that's not for women.

966
00:55:42,870 --> 00:55:45,750
Like that flowing lock
thing with a tight pants.

967
00:55:46,050 --> 00:55:48,090
Chicks like the Marlboro man.

968
00:55:48,870 --> 00:55:51,660
They want a guy who's built
like Don Frye who's got like,

969
00:55:51,661 --> 00:55:55,320
they know he's got a six pack under
that like fucking cowboy shirt,

970
00:55:55,530 --> 00:55:57,690
but they don't see,
they want to see it on the outside.

971
00:55:57,780 --> 00:56:02,490
That's a guy thing like guys want
to see like yoga pants on a chick.

972
00:56:02,700 --> 00:56:05,760
Like a girl could walk down the street
with yoga pants and a camel toe.

973
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:07,740
Totally acceptable.

974
00:56:08,170 --> 00:56:12,750
Guy Walked down the street with
fucking ballet tights on and no shirt.

975
00:56:12,810 --> 00:56:17,700
Jesus Christ is Hugh Jackman. That's
not real. Yeah. No it's not. Come on.

976
00:56:17,701 --> 00:56:20,460
That's not real. That guy's face is
Photoshop. You're so full of shit.

977
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:24,330
Look at that guy on the left
last night. The lighting,

978
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:26,170
the lighting is totally bad.

979
00:56:26,230 --> 00:56:29,440
Not Real there they have their
shadows are in the wrong direction.

980
00:56:29,441 --> 00:56:31,120
Hugh Jackman Shadow's coming towards us.

981
00:56:31,121 --> 00:56:35,530
This guy's shadow is going towards
his left shoulder in unreal.

982
00:56:35,890 --> 00:56:40,600
Kicked the fuck out of here. How dare you
think that Dude's HGH in? Uh, probably.

983
00:56:40,601 --> 00:56:45,300
Yeah, if he's smart. Shred it out,
Bro. We were, for whatever reason,

984
00:56:45,310 --> 00:56:48,040
Brian was obsessed with the
fact that Hugh Jackman was Kay.

985
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:51,730
He wouldn't stop talking about it.
It's fucking hands were moving.

986
00:56:51,731 --> 00:56:55,930
He kept puffing on the glass. Dick. He
was like, I hear you. Jacqueline's gay.

987
00:56:57,710 --> 00:57:01,570
There's multiple pictures of him
holding hands with guys. Come on,

988
00:57:01,571 --> 00:57:04,030
son is multiple pictures of me
with big black dicks in my mouth.

989
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:09,580
Hold on a second. Back that up because
one of those look real. Go ahead.

990
00:57:09,581 --> 00:57:11,320
Go piss you weak bladder
at son of a bitch.

991
00:57:11,860 --> 00:57:14,290
Who's the guy with the
beard is a Wolverine Fan.

992
00:57:14,380 --> 00:57:17,740
He's telling them how I'm watching
that movie. Uh, made him cure cancer.

993
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:22,690
That's what it is. So Hugh Jackman's
guy in the right, let me see,

994
00:57:22,691 --> 00:57:24,670
is he really holding that guy's
hand or is that a perspective,

995
00:57:24,671 --> 00:57:28,420
that perspective thing.
Who cares if he's gay?

996
00:57:28,630 --> 00:57:30,280
But it's a weird thing like a chicken.

997
00:57:30,281 --> 00:57:35,050
Be Gay like a Jodie foster and everyone
knows she's gay. She's out. It's all good.

998
00:57:35,140 --> 00:57:39,970
And she could play elite. Okay.
That is super gay. God sexy.

999
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:44,500
He looks so,
he's looked so big.

1000
00:57:48,490 --> 00:57:53,230
But you know, if a woman like Jodie foster
be decides to come out and you know,

1001
00:57:53,410 --> 00:57:57,280
proclaims that she's gay, that's not
real either. Stop it. Just stop. Stop.

1002
00:57:57,281 --> 00:58:01,720
Now it's a my pants.
What's this guy doing?

1003
00:58:01,721 --> 00:58:05,200
It's talking about cook.
I didn't play on this. Um,

1004
00:58:05,770 --> 00:58:08,080
a woman could still play
a heterosexual woman,

1005
00:58:08,380 --> 00:58:11,500
but a man has a really hard
time unless it's that, um,

1006
00:58:11,710 --> 00:58:16,030
the dude on how I met your mother.
What's his name? Neil. Neil.

1007
00:58:16,031 --> 00:58:19,120
Patrick Harris. Neil Patrick Harris.
His case. He's still lovable. Yeah.

1008
00:58:19,150 --> 00:58:20,020
Well he's not just level,

1009
00:58:20,021 --> 00:58:23,710
but he plays a guy who's like
a ladies' man on the show,

1010
00:58:24,490 --> 00:58:27,430
which is quite hilarious.
But you know why I think though,

1011
00:58:27,431 --> 00:58:31,330
I think because he had some money from
that Howard Kumar movie where he plays

1012
00:58:31,331 --> 00:58:35,590
such a pimp. I think that's, that's
kind of Burton people's thoughts still.

1013
00:58:35,650 --> 00:58:38,650
I never saw that movie, so I have no idea
what the white castle, I never saw it.

1014
00:58:38,650 --> 00:58:41,470
Never know.
But he's a funny guy and a talented actor.

1015
00:58:41,471 --> 00:58:44,180
I think that's more likely than ever.
And I think we're,

1016
00:58:44,181 --> 00:58:45,160
we're in a different time.

1017
00:58:45,161 --> 00:58:49,570
I think people like supporting the idea
of a guy being out and open. You know?

1018
00:58:49,571 --> 00:58:52,930
I think especially in Hollywood,
that's like the place where people,

1019
00:58:53,140 --> 00:58:57,190
but when it comes to movies, movies
are a different animal because movies,

1020
00:58:57,191 --> 00:59:01,930
you got to sell tickets, you got to
sell hard fucking tickets. And you know,

1021
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:04,300
if the Midwest, no
worries. I'm just talking.

1022
00:59:04,790 --> 00:59:07,540
The Midwest comes over and you know,

1023
00:59:07,541 --> 00:59:11,920
they see that some big gay guy like Hugh
Jackman is in some fucking movie where

1024
00:59:11,921 --> 00:59:13,900
he's playing a girlfriend too.

1025
00:59:14,110 --> 00:59:17,820
Who's the chick that's always on sports
illustrated? Kate Upton. Oh, Kate Upton.

1026
00:59:18,490 --> 00:59:21,470
He's playing Kate Upton's husband. You're
going to like get the fuck out of it.

1027
00:59:21,471 --> 00:59:26,210
Yeah, he's good. He
wins. He wins. He wins.

1028
00:59:26,210 --> 00:59:29,420
He's big. He's gay. He's beautiful.
He's got, he's got it both ways.

1029
00:59:29,660 --> 00:59:32,600
The New York Times apparently wrote
a thing about him being by, right.

1030
00:59:32,601 --> 00:59:33,550
That's what you guys are saying.
Yeah.

1031
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:37,580
But I think that's just someone's wishful
thinking because he does musicals.

1032
00:59:38,030 --> 00:59:41,690
Yeah. No. If you like theater, musical
theater, apparently you've got to be gay.

1033
00:59:42,040 --> 00:59:45,590
Yeah. But manage. If you were straight,
how much asks you be crushing,

1034
00:59:45,980 --> 00:59:46,761
cause it'd be you,

1035
00:59:46,761 --> 00:59:51,560
a bunch of gay dudes and chicks everywhere
if you are in musical theater. Yeah.

1036
00:59:51,561 --> 00:59:53,160
If you were straight guy,
musical theater,

1037
00:59:53,180 --> 00:59:57,020
do you really think women are the
primary viewers of musical theater?

1038
00:59:57,050 --> 01:00:00,670
I think there's, I mean, acting
and dancing. How dare you.

1039
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:04,760
Dancers in musical theater pull you,
push your seat back and think this over,

1040
01:00:04,761 --> 01:00:08,840
put your hand on your Chin like
this and do this. So Fuck No.

1041
01:00:09,300 --> 01:00:13,910
The whole room is not gay. The whole
audiences, gay and menopausal women,

1042
01:00:13,940 --> 01:00:17,240
that's who goes to see musicals in the
few confused young girls who eventually

1043
01:00:17,241 --> 01:00:21,620
abandon the art form and then just go to,
they want to look cool in college.

1044
01:00:21,621 --> 01:00:23,090
They say, Oh my God, I love musicals.

1045
01:00:23,091 --> 01:00:26,180
And then they go and they realized
musicals are dog shit. If it was any good,

1046
01:00:26,181 --> 01:00:29,090
it would be in a goddamn movie. All
right. You'd be able to see things happen.

1047
01:00:29,091 --> 01:00:32,210
Real monsters. Amazing. Blowguns it is,

1048
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:36,380
but like a comedy performance
than it is a musical.

1049
01:00:36,530 --> 01:00:41,240
I mean they call it a musical, but it's
really like a sketch comedy performance,

1050
01:00:41,241 --> 01:00:44,240
like a Saturday night live piece that
goes on for an hour and a half. I mean,

1051
01:00:44,241 --> 01:00:47,780
that's really what it was like really
good. But to call that a musical, no,

1052
01:00:47,870 --> 01:00:51,170
musicals are drab.
There's like fucking,

1053
01:00:51,350 --> 01:00:56,210
there's songs in there about romance
and love and the two people meet again,

1054
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:59,480
they're nonsense.
We have movies now.

1055
01:00:59,570 --> 01:01:04,190
If you want to tell me Chicago chicks
don't like to the musical Chicago,

1056
01:01:04,220 --> 01:01:05,053
they'd love to tell you.

1057
01:01:05,690 --> 01:01:09,500
I've seen the musical
Chicago and it is dog shit,

1058
01:01:10,430 --> 01:01:13,220
dog shit. And I went to watch
a very good friend of mine.

1059
01:01:13,460 --> 01:01:16,220
I went to support her and
sit there and watch Chicago.

1060
01:01:16,460 --> 01:01:19,210
And when it was the halfway through,
we were all sitting around,

1061
01:01:19,220 --> 01:01:22,430
we're all talking and really, so what do
you think? Wow. It's really, really good.

1062
01:01:22,431 --> 01:01:26,300
Like everybody was like, you know, like
hedging the words. I go, it's dog shit.

1063
01:01:26,510 --> 01:01:28,100
It's watchable dog shit.

1064
01:01:28,220 --> 01:01:32,120
And finally the older gentlemen in
the group who we look to for guidance,

1065
01:01:32,121 --> 01:01:34,880
it goes, it's, I've never been a fan
of the art form. It's fucking terrible.

1066
01:01:35,180 --> 01:01:38,420
And we were like, it's not
good, right? Like what's going
on here? Like you go see,

1067
01:01:38,450 --> 01:01:39,920
go see,
they don't do cats anymore.

1068
01:01:39,950 --> 01:01:42,980
But if you went to see cats
halfway through cats, he'd be like,

1069
01:01:43,310 --> 01:01:47,210
what the fuck am I watching?
What are you doing to me here?

1070
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:51,230
This is a murderous assault
on my attention span.

1071
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:53,480
And somehow I know that
you've convinced to,

1072
01:01:54,020 --> 01:01:56,690
I'm sure a lot of people think
that in my act, but that's fine.

1073
01:01:56,720 --> 01:02:00,920
You don't have to go see it.
All right. Some people like
it. Some people like cats.

1074
01:02:00,980 --> 01:02:04,730
I get that as well. I just don't
understand those people at all.

1075
01:02:05,510 --> 01:02:08,000
Have you heard of, Oh, have
you heard of that movie?

1076
01:02:08,001 --> 01:02:11,900
That's a like or I mean that play, that's
like we're guys all act like horses.

1077
01:02:12,050 --> 01:02:16,130
I there's like three. Yeah, I heard
that's pretty sweet. You should go.

1078
01:02:16,370 --> 01:02:19,950
You should go and give a full lines.
Kre King.

1079
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:24,270
I see lions fuck out of here.
Get the fuck out of here.

1080
01:02:24,610 --> 01:02:27,090
I would say I saw Cirque
de Solei and that was dope.

1081
01:02:27,540 --> 01:02:29,250
Cirque de Solei is because it's uh,

1082
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:33,450
it's like watching the Olympics with
music and it's like you're watching people

1083
01:02:33,451 --> 01:02:35,040
do shit that's impossible.

1084
01:02:35,220 --> 01:02:39,900
Guys doing handstands and they have like
a woman like attached to their hand and

1085
01:02:39,901 --> 01:02:42,900
they were like supporting her.
Like they have one hand on the ground,

1086
01:02:43,080 --> 01:02:45,120
one hand up in the air that's
holding a woman you like.

1087
01:02:45,121 --> 01:02:47,130
How are you even fucking doing that?

1088
01:02:47,310 --> 01:02:50,670
The guys like there's guys who are
doing handstands on each other's arms.

1089
01:02:50,671 --> 01:02:52,260
Unbelievable.
It's insane.

1090
01:02:52,470 --> 01:02:57,470
You feel so weak and feeble when you
go to see more so than going to see the

1091
01:02:57,871 --> 01:02:59,890
UFC,
you feel weak and feeble.

1092
01:02:59,891 --> 01:03:02,560
When you go to Cirque de Solei
cause you watch them do things.

1093
01:03:02,561 --> 01:03:05,730
Do you like how long would it take me
to even come close to being to fuck,

1094
01:03:05,910 --> 01:03:08,880
I can't do that. If I have
those skills, I become a Ninja.

1095
01:03:09,510 --> 01:03:13,350
Did someone die recently? It started. So
yeah, they did some, but it wasn't, no,

1096
01:03:13,351 --> 01:03:15,150
it was Ringling brothers.
It was both.

1097
01:03:15,390 --> 01:03:18,900
It was Cirque de Solei and then
there was like nine people that died.

1098
01:03:18,930 --> 01:03:21,030
I went and saw a show
where the guy missed it,

1099
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:26,360
missed the thing and he just felt hope
and the whole room was just quiet.

1100
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:30,010
How was he? Uh, he got
back up. Up Man. Whoa.

1101
01:03:30,060 --> 01:03:31,940
I'm sure he took a beating off stage.

1102
01:03:31,941 --> 01:03:36,360
Fall only like about six or seven feet.

1103
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:41,070
That's still, man, that
jumped from the ceiling. That
would fuck you up. It's like,

1104
01:03:41,071 --> 01:03:44,580
well, how tall is that ceiling is about
eight feet. No. Yeah, that's good.

1105
01:03:44,581 --> 01:03:49,380
I got to be more jammy. 10, eight, eight,
nine two the droplets go nine. Okay,

1106
01:03:49,381 --> 01:03:53,400
let's go nine. You, you know,
that would suck. That would suck.

1107
01:03:53,401 --> 01:03:57,120
I would suck and hurt,
but we're so weak.

1108
01:03:57,270 --> 01:04:02,010
My cat is 17 fucking years old.
I got a cat that I've had forever,

1109
01:04:02,011 --> 01:04:06,720
man. My sister gave him to me, her
to me, she had a bunch of kittens.

1110
01:04:06,721 --> 01:04:09,450
There were all these
wacky kittens and her cat.

1111
01:04:09,451 --> 01:04:11,870
She had this one cat and they like you.

1112
01:04:12,090 --> 01:04:15,270
They lived in this rural place and they
didn't fix their cat and their cat one

1113
01:04:15,271 --> 01:04:19,140
up getting fuck by some other, cause I've
heard the cats fucking outside my door.

1114
01:04:19,190 --> 01:04:21,960
It sounds like murders going
on. Well, anybody who does that,

1115
01:04:23,160 --> 01:04:24,690
you release a male cat.

1116
01:04:24,730 --> 01:04:29,370
Like you're creating a real fucking
problem and an a spade and unspayed female

1117
01:04:29,371 --> 01:04:31,440
cat.
You're creating a real fucking problem.

1118
01:04:31,441 --> 01:04:33,690
Like feral cats are fucking huge issue.

1119
01:04:33,900 --> 01:04:38,190
Not just because of the fact that they
decimate bird populations and things

1120
01:04:38,191 --> 01:04:41,070
along those lines,
but also because of diseases they carry.

1121
01:04:41,340 --> 01:04:45,460
They're the number one purveyor
of this toxo plasma. Uh,

1122
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:47,010
in toxoplasmosis,

1123
01:04:47,020 --> 01:04:52,020
a bacteria or a disease rather parasite
that people have really common in third

1124
01:04:53,131 --> 01:04:56,130
world countries,
dirty pussies effects your affects.

1125
01:04:56,131 --> 01:04:59,160
Your brain does a lot of fucked
up shit to your oh yeah. Yeah.

1126
01:04:59,161 --> 01:05:03,270
And it's super common and it, it also,
the cat shit gets in the meat. It's like,

1127
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:06,060
it's like a real issue
with, uh, with fucking cats.

1128
01:05:06,120 --> 01:05:10,230
Is this something about like some
bacteria that gets in or a virus, virus?

1129
01:05:10,231 --> 01:05:14,400
It gets into a mouse's head and he
has it to run inside the, it's a rat.

1130
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:17,040
If it's a,
what it does is,

1131
01:05:17,230 --> 01:05:20,260
I've talked about this many times
in this podcast, but it hasn't,

1132
01:05:20,290 --> 01:05:21,730
it's been a long time,
more than a year.

1133
01:05:22,210 --> 01:05:27,210
The way it works is it rewires the rats
sexual reward system and it makes a rat

1134
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:29,471
attracted,

1135
01:05:29,471 --> 01:05:34,420
sexually attracted to the smell of cat
piss to the point where it's testy swell

1136
01:05:34,421 --> 01:05:38,320
up and he gets like, he's in
estrus, he's like, he's hurting,

1137
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:43,560
he's got blue balls because he smells
this cat piss like red ban on hot rod,

1138
01:05:43,691 --> 01:05:47,560
5,000 red ban all day.
So all day.

1139
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:52,260
So he essentially on a double
dose of Cialis with, uh,

1140
01:05:52,330 --> 01:05:57,150
an added a acorns. It, it's no,
well it does a weird thing to um,

1141
01:05:57,240 --> 01:05:58,870
their,
their fear system.

1142
01:05:59,250 --> 01:06:02,050
It hijacks their fear system so
they're not afraid of cats anymore.

1143
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:05,540
If there's videos like pull
up his video, Brian. Um,

1144
01:06:05,560 --> 01:06:10,560
it's a toxo plasmosis
infected rat chases cat.

1145
01:06:11,480 --> 01:06:15,730
This rat is running after the
cat trying to get some cat piss.

1146
01:06:16,110 --> 01:06:19,600
It's like go running up to the cat's ass.
Like has no fear of the cats.

1147
01:06:20,020 --> 01:06:23,650
So cats eat these rats
and then the cats get it.

1148
01:06:23,651 --> 01:06:27,910
And apparently it doesn't really affect
the behavior of the cats because cats

1149
01:06:27,911 --> 01:06:31,540
are evil from the jump, that evil
from the evil, from the jump.

1150
01:06:31,541 --> 01:06:34,960
It doesn't make a more evil. They don't
get the worst roommate ever. They're like,

1151
01:06:35,680 --> 01:06:38,650
pick up my shit. Yeah, feed me.
I'm out of here. This is the video.

1152
01:06:38,651 --> 01:06:42,370
These cats are like, what the
fuck is going on? I look this rat.

1153
01:06:42,850 --> 01:06:46,150
You could kill them the language,
but this,

1154
01:06:46,151 --> 01:06:50,740
this rat starts going towards these cats
and he's like literally trying to get

1155
01:06:50,741 --> 01:06:52,150
at their,
their bag.

1156
01:06:53,380 --> 01:06:57,940
Give me that buck that Iran is not afraid
of. He just jumped on. That cat's back.

1157
01:06:58,120 --> 01:07:01,870
Look how crazy that is. Give me
that. But Yo dude, how crazy is that?

1158
01:07:01,871 --> 01:07:04,570
That rat just jumped on.
That cat's back.

1159
01:07:05,500 --> 01:07:10,150
They're not afraid of peep of cats at all.
Like how does that even happen?

1160
01:07:10,151 --> 01:07:13,270
How does that sort gangster man,
they really are gangster animals.

1161
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:16,960
But why does that virus come around
or that bacteria, whatever it is,

1162
01:07:16,961 --> 01:07:20,890
and how's that form and how did know
to do that to that mouse and make that

1163
01:07:20,891 --> 01:07:25,810
happen? And there's only one answer.
Jesus. There is the Jesus man. Jesus.

1164
01:07:25,811 --> 01:07:30,580
The Jesus is the answer. It must be
God. Why? Jesus? Yeah, we'll look.

1165
01:07:30,581 --> 01:07:35,410
God has a plan. Sam.
That cat's ass. Yes. Yes.

1166
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:38,620
That people right now angry. They're
angry. And you know why you're angry.

1167
01:07:38,770 --> 01:07:40,850
You know why you're angry?
Because what I'm saying,

1168
01:07:40,851 --> 01:07:44,290
it makes you feel like what you
believe is silly. And do you know why?

1169
01:07:44,500 --> 01:07:48,340
Why wait for it?
Because of what you believe is silly.

1170
01:07:48,550 --> 01:07:50,260
Silly talk wasn't silly.

1171
01:07:50,590 --> 01:07:55,590
I wouldn't be able to make you angry
if like people were joking around about

1172
01:07:56,410 --> 01:08:01,130
what men when I was sex with women.
Well cause it feels good. Oh,

1173
01:08:01,720 --> 01:08:02,860
you'd be like,
okay,

1174
01:08:03,380 --> 01:08:06,880
if that's the reason why
Hetero phobic doesn't work.

1175
01:08:07,150 --> 01:08:10,120
Like if homophobic people looking
at us like, Eh, yeah, what do you,

1176
01:08:10,150 --> 01:08:12,550
but you fucked girls,
Eh,

1177
01:08:12,910 --> 01:08:16,760
what do you a breeder ill he'd be
like, okay, you're just being mean.

1178
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:19,310
You're not hurting my feelings.
I feel your mean energy.

1179
01:08:19,311 --> 01:08:23,900
But this shit doesn't work. Doesn't
change how I feel about life. You know?

1180
01:08:24,470 --> 01:08:27,050
That's what's going on Sam. I
get it man. It's just weird.

1181
01:08:27,310 --> 01:08:30,470
And I was talking about this on
stage the other day about how like,

1182
01:08:30,850 --> 01:08:32,690
is this a bit you working on
another bit right now? No,

1183
01:08:32,760 --> 01:08:36,950
but I'm just saying that it goes along
the lines of what you're saying is just

1184
01:08:36,951 --> 01:08:38,360
like, you know, there's all this,

1185
01:08:39,230 --> 01:08:42,230
these people who are conservative
morals and stuff and they don't,

1186
01:08:42,260 --> 01:08:43,640
oh you shouldn't do this,
shouldn't do that,

1187
01:08:43,641 --> 01:08:45,710
shouldn't do that because you've
been told us over these years,

1188
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:48,770
but yet over the last century or so,

1189
01:08:49,100 --> 01:08:51,740
most of those thoughts have been debunked.

1190
01:08:51,770 --> 01:08:55,820
Meaning there's places where people
allow what you're saying is evil.

1191
01:08:55,850 --> 01:08:59,480
It's going to ruin society and
a society is going to crumble.

1192
01:09:00,140 --> 01:09:04,970
People allow this happen and it doesn't.
Yeah. And so what are you saying?

1193
01:09:05,140 --> 01:09:07,790
Cause if like all this stuff where
you're like you shouldn't pay for sacs.

1194
01:09:07,791 --> 01:09:11,140
He shouldn't do drugs, you shouldn't do
all this shit cause it's gets the, the,

1195
01:09:11,141 --> 01:09:14,780
you know the god yet in Amsterdam,

1196
01:09:14,781 --> 01:09:19,781
all of that is legal and there's not fires
coming from the skies and monkey find

1197
01:09:19,881 --> 01:09:23,690
monkeys, tea bag and everybody and
you know, just like it just is,

1198
01:09:23,691 --> 01:09:28,220
it's been proven that that
what suppression is not
good for people that don't

1199
01:09:28,221 --> 01:09:32,360
like it. It's a bad way to raise children.
It's a bad way to raise a nation, right?

1200
01:09:32,361 --> 01:09:35,600
It's just people don't like suppression.
It's really that simple.

1201
01:09:35,690 --> 01:09:37,220
They don't like it.
They got upset.

1202
01:09:37,250 --> 01:09:39,770
[inaudible] you're another person and
you're telling the guy what to do,

1203
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:42,020
telling the guy can't shirk off.
What does that guy want to do?

1204
01:09:42,021 --> 01:09:45,830
He wants a jerk off as soon as he gets
away from you and wants a book doors and

1205
01:09:45,831 --> 01:09:50,300
just jerk off in privacy and then feel
terrible about it and then repent and you

1206
01:09:50,301 --> 01:09:54,650
know, Kellogg, no sense. You know,
Kellogg's, the guy from the cereal,

1207
01:09:54,651 --> 01:09:58,220
Kellogg's cereal. W The reason why
this is you got to read this book,

1208
01:09:58,221 --> 01:10:03,150
sex at dawn by this Guy Chris Ryan,
podcast guest, fascinating guy. Um,

1209
01:10:03,710 --> 01:10:07,100
I've read that book. I've done a bunch
of podcasts with him and Duncan Trussell.

1210
01:10:07,101 --> 01:10:09,190
He's a really interesting guy,
but one of the things the,

1211
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:12,770
he sent me hip to his like Kellogg's,
you can find us online,

1212
01:10:13,100 --> 01:10:14,540
created cornflakes,

1213
01:10:14,630 --> 01:10:18,050
created mild tasting food to keep
people from getting sexually aroused.

1214
01:10:18,590 --> 01:10:21,950
Said that he lived with his wife for
like 40 years and bragged about having

1215
01:10:21,951 --> 01:10:23,720
never having had sex with her,

1216
01:10:24,110 --> 01:10:28,280
but kept a male intern who
would give him daily enemas.

1217
01:10:30,680 --> 01:10:33,230
That's fucking Kellogg's.
So think about that.

1218
01:10:33,500 --> 01:10:38,210
Repressing sexual thoughts,
unbelief, pressing and actively,

1219
01:10:38,270 --> 01:10:40,070
actively repressing sexual thoughts.

1220
01:10:40,071 --> 01:10:44,960
And yet obviously fighting off
the gay tooth claw and Fang,

1221
01:10:45,380 --> 01:10:47,180
right?
Obviously fighting off the gay.

1222
01:10:47,330 --> 01:10:51,540
The guy had a male assistant who's
mustache gay, he's gay as fuck

1223
01:10:53,240 --> 01:10:57,290
face boy. Put a leather, uh,
paper boy cap on him and uh,

1224
01:10:57,320 --> 01:11:01,580
no shirt and cutoff jeans.
Okay, you see it? Please do.

1225
01:11:01,700 --> 01:11:05,540
Let me do that right now, Jack. Now,
I mean if you see that guy's face,

1226
01:11:05,720 --> 01:11:06,710
just what a great book,

1227
01:11:06,740 --> 01:11:09,650
you'll probably get an even better
picture of them where you could go full,

1228
01:11:09,651 --> 01:11:13,530
full fucking body and then go with
the color specific thing. Mcdonald,

1229
01:11:13,570 --> 01:11:16,020
get an obvious Photoshop, make
it. I think it really looked real.

1230
01:11:16,100 --> 01:11:19,400
I wonder if she was getting Dick
on the side. Mrs Kellogg's. Oh,

1231
01:11:19,401 --> 01:11:21,230
sh Mrs Kellogg was fucking
a personal trainer.

1232
01:11:21,410 --> 01:11:24,540
They didn't even have post
personal trainers back then.
She invented, vented it.

1233
01:11:25,870 --> 01:11:28,910
She'd vented just so that she
can have somebody touch me.

1234
01:11:29,170 --> 01:11:33,410
Did Jesus touch me?
Unbelievable.

1235
01:11:33,640 --> 01:11:34,810
Well, that's people, man.

1236
01:11:34,930 --> 01:11:39,100
People that are suppressing other people
are usually doing it to try to suppress

1237
01:11:39,101 --> 01:11:40,090
him.
Something in themselves.

1238
01:11:40,280 --> 01:11:44,150
That's why a lot of conservatives, I
just, I just, it's like you're lying.

1239
01:11:44,151 --> 01:11:47,630
I think a lot. I'm not judging all, but
it's like when you sit there and you say,

1240
01:11:47,631 --> 01:11:50,810
Oh, you shouldn't do this, this and
this. Most of the time you're doing this,

1241
01:11:50,811 --> 01:11:53,390
this and this.
You just want to put laws on other people.

1242
01:11:53,391 --> 01:11:57,500
Like I go to Arizona a lot to do
gigs and it's a fun state to do gigs,

1243
01:11:57,501 --> 01:12:00,350
but they have all these crazy laws.
Yeah,

1244
01:12:00,770 --> 01:12:03,170
they party more than anybody I know.

1245
01:12:03,580 --> 01:12:07,730
So it's like they're just making laws
for other people that doesn't apply to

1246
01:12:07,731 --> 01:12:10,930
them. Why do you think that is? What
do you think that is? I don't get,

1247
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:15,260
I don't know why, man. You're
right. It's fear. It's also theirs.

1248
01:12:15,470 --> 01:12:16,020
Here's the other,
the

1249
01:12:16,020 --> 01:12:19,800
problem with fear and this idea
of everyone should be loving.

1250
01:12:20,700 --> 01:12:23,460
There's certain folks
that are already done.

1251
01:12:23,610 --> 01:12:25,920
See this is one of the real problems,
okay?

1252
01:12:26,250 --> 01:12:30,000
This is one of the real problems
with society as a whole.

1253
01:12:30,120 --> 01:12:32,940
Cultural in general and
just human interaction.

1254
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:37,800
This is one of the real problems
is that some people already done,

1255
01:12:38,030 --> 01:12:42,510
somebody has made them, they've done
a piss poor job of feeding them,

1256
01:12:42,570 --> 01:12:47,100
raising them, and then sending them
out into the world and they're fucked.

1257
01:12:47,160 --> 01:12:51,720
These people are fucked.
If you can run into those people,

1258
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:54,510
they can ruin your fucking life.
And that's a fact.

1259
01:12:54,810 --> 01:12:59,460
So there's no way of fixing them either,
by the way, they might fix themselves,

1260
01:12:59,461 --> 01:13:02,220
but it depends on the severity
of how fucked up they are.

1261
01:13:02,340 --> 01:13:05,850
Some people are too far fucked.
You never bring them back.

1262
01:13:06,330 --> 01:13:10,140
And those people are out there
wandering through the world too.

1263
01:13:10,350 --> 01:13:14,700
So when people see that and they see
that you can't treat that with love.

1264
01:13:14,910 --> 01:13:17,370
And some people say, well, you got
to treat him with love. And they go,

1265
01:13:17,371 --> 01:13:19,050
oh you fucking liberals ruin everything.

1266
01:13:19,170 --> 01:13:22,620
And then you have this division between
people that are conservative and that

1267
01:13:22,621 --> 01:13:26,520
care and then people who are liberal than
care and the liberal people think the

1268
01:13:26,521 --> 01:13:30,900
conservatives are cruel
and the conservative people
think that the liberals have,

1269
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:34,650
you know, some idealized view
of the world that doesn't work.

1270
01:13:34,651 --> 01:13:39,240
It only works because hard man are out
there doing the bad deeds to keep the

1271
01:13:39,241 --> 01:13:42,330
world safe and they fucking
support the troops on their bumper.

1272
01:13:42,840 --> 01:13:46,590
The real problem is it's a
mass, it's huge. It's a mass.

1273
01:13:46,740 --> 01:13:50,670
It's constantly changing and
it's going on all the time,

1274
01:13:50,671 --> 01:13:51,600
whether you like it or not.

1275
01:13:51,601 --> 01:13:54,690
When we sit in this podcast
room for three hours and talk,

1276
01:13:54,870 --> 01:13:59,870
there's murders and rapes and robberies
and car accidents and lies and there's

1277
01:14:00,061 --> 01:14:03,870
just so many people that it's going
on in some way, shape or form.

1278
01:14:03,870 --> 01:14:06,000
Someone's doing something fucked up.
Yes,

1279
01:14:06,180 --> 01:14:10,530
and that's why we need to figure out how,
first and foremost,

1280
01:14:10,830 --> 01:14:13,180
how fix people that are fucked up.

1281
01:14:13,390 --> 01:14:15,760
That would should be before
we talk about going to Mars,

1282
01:14:15,880 --> 01:14:19,910
before we taught what we should be
concentrating as a whole, as a co,

1283
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:20,890
as a culture,

1284
01:14:20,890 --> 01:14:25,890
is not just like figuring out how to
fucking frack or figuring out how to pull

1285
01:14:26,351 --> 01:14:29,550
out of Afghanistan, how you fix
all these fucking crazy people.

1286
01:14:30,040 --> 01:14:32,140
How do we think some,
can you fix them?

1287
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:36,730
Could it be done with mushrooms
and Mtma and electro shock therapy?

1288
01:14:36,820 --> 01:14:38,110
Can we change their blood?

1289
01:14:38,230 --> 01:14:43,230
Can we add artificial fucking genes
to their system that induces empathy?

1290
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:45,760
Is there a way,
is if there's not a way,

1291
01:14:46,060 --> 01:14:49,480
then we're always going to
have this vicious cycle of
dealing with shitty people.

1292
01:14:49,510 --> 01:14:51,100
Sheedy people making more shitty people.

1293
01:14:51,101 --> 01:14:52,690
Should he be bill
fucking shitty people up?

1294
01:14:52,780 --> 01:14:56,320
People dealing with people who fucked
them up their whole life in therapy their

1295
01:14:56,321 --> 01:14:57,340
whole life.
You know,

1296
01:14:57,341 --> 01:15:00,150
constantly talking about the abuse had
happened and then when they were wrong.

1297
01:15:00,160 --> 01:15:01,540
Cause it's defined them as a person.

1298
01:15:02,010 --> 01:15:06,070
And I also feel that there's so many
people making money off of Shitty people.

1299
01:15:06,730 --> 01:15:09,820
You know, the drug war,
the, uh, the, uh, uh,

1300
01:15:09,910 --> 01:15:12,370
privatized prisons and stuff like that,

1301
01:15:12,371 --> 01:15:16,330
that you're fighting against this group
who it's not in their best interest that

1302
01:15:16,331 --> 01:15:19,870
these people get fixed. Yeah.
Well, it's like anything else,

1303
01:15:20,100 --> 01:15:21,100
anything that comes along,

1304
01:15:21,130 --> 01:15:26,050
even if it's a legit issue like
global climate change. You know,

1305
01:15:26,051 --> 01:15:29,220
the real issue that a lot of people have
when it comes to global climate change

1306
01:15:29,221 --> 01:15:32,350
is when you see a guy like Al Gore
who's made a fuck load of money off of

1307
01:15:32,351 --> 01:15:35,140
climate change, then people start
saying, oh, it's a business.

1308
01:15:35,290 --> 01:15:38,320
These kinds of invested interest. There's
thousands and thousands of people. Like,

1309
01:15:38,650 --> 01:15:43,560
yes, but still the world's the
fucking, the climate is changing. No,

1310
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:45,820
but yes, yes, people
are making money off it,

1311
01:15:45,940 --> 01:15:49,360
but it doesn't mean that it's
all bullshit. Like there's
a lot going on here, man.

1312
01:15:49,361 --> 01:15:51,580
It's not an,
it's like almost everything else in life.

1313
01:15:51,730 --> 01:15:53,050
It's not a black and white issue.

1314
01:15:53,200 --> 01:15:55,840
There's a whole lot of different
fucking things going on. There's,

1315
01:15:55,841 --> 01:15:57,460
there's people that are bad,

1316
01:15:57,650 --> 01:16:01,660
then there's a problem and then there's
people that are bad that that profit off

1317
01:16:01,661 --> 01:16:02,770
of a real problem too.

1318
01:16:03,130 --> 01:16:07,090
Did you watch the last vice I or two
vices ago when they were doing about the

1319
01:16:07,091 --> 01:16:08,980
drought in Texas? Oh, I didn't see that.

1320
01:16:09,180 --> 01:16:12,350
People were just praying to the
God for this and then they bring,

1321
01:16:12,360 --> 01:16:14,860
do you believe in global
warming? Nah, not really.

1322
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:17,770
But then they would have
singing hymns to God too.

1323
01:16:18,070 --> 01:16:23,070
It's just so interesting about how like
people have manipulated other people to

1324
01:16:23,321 --> 01:16:27,730
believe in their best interest
when you're like, it's like, well,

1325
01:16:27,731 --> 01:16:30,250
it's not just that though.
It's also voluntary.

1326
01:16:30,670 --> 01:16:35,080
I've seen people that want to believe that
the world is not changing temperature.

1327
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:40,330
I've seen people that want to believe in
global warming simply because it's like

1328
01:16:40,331 --> 01:16:43,270
the conservative viewpoint.
They're like, oh, come on.

1329
01:16:43,271 --> 01:16:46,240
It ain't cause they've been told that
from the top. You know, I had this guy,

1330
01:16:46,241 --> 01:16:48,220
Randall Carlson on the podcast recently.

1331
01:16:48,221 --> 01:16:50,410
You've talked about climate
change throughout the history,

1332
01:16:50,430 --> 01:16:51,700
the known history of the earth.

1333
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:56,110
And it was incredibly fascinating and he
absolutely believes that a human beings,

1334
01:16:56,111 --> 01:17:00,790
and you know our carbon footprint
plays a part in, in global warming.

1335
01:17:00,940 --> 01:17:03,760
But he said that the real issue is
there's a lot of other factors that play a

1336
01:17:03,761 --> 01:17:05,290
part and they have throughout history,

1337
01:17:05,291 --> 01:17:08,860
like we're co concerning
ourselves primarily with people,

1338
01:17:08,861 --> 01:17:09,950
with what people have done.

1339
01:17:09,950 --> 01:17:12,260
And we have done a fucked up
job on this earth and he said,

1340
01:17:12,261 --> 01:17:15,800
I'm more concerned with the particulate
matter that like burning coal and

1341
01:17:15,801 --> 01:17:16,820
pollution and stuff,

1342
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:20,780
but what it does to our air quality
than I am the actual warming.

1343
01:17:21,020 --> 01:17:25,400
Cause he started going off about global
cooling and about what it used to be

1344
01:17:25,401 --> 01:17:26,270
like here on earth.

1345
01:17:26,420 --> 01:17:30,200
And it was one of the most terrifying
podcast I've ever listened to.

1346
01:17:30,220 --> 01:17:34,220
Jesus this cause he knows a lot
and he's not just making shit up.

1347
01:17:34,221 --> 01:17:36,710
He's talking about ice core samples.
You're talking about known history.

1348
01:17:36,830 --> 01:17:37,940
Even just the known history.

1349
01:17:37,970 --> 01:17:42,970
Totally noncontroversial known history
that all scientists accept is that 10,000

1350
01:17:43,071 --> 01:17:47,390
years ago North America
was almost entirely covered
with ice and that there was

1351
01:17:47,400 --> 01:17:52,220
a two mile high thick
wall of ice over Canada.

1352
01:17:52,460 --> 01:17:57,140
Oh my God. Two miles. It's
insane. It's unbelievably insane.

1353
01:17:57,170 --> 01:18:00,380
It's unbelievably insane and
it's a fact. Oh man, that's real.

1354
01:18:00,470 --> 01:18:03,620
It's like this fine line between
wanting to know the facts and just like,

1355
01:18:03,621 --> 01:18:07,790
it's out of my hands, dude. He was also
talking about some without a doubt,

1356
01:18:08,030 --> 01:18:09,980
beyond a shadow of a doubt,

1357
01:18:09,981 --> 01:18:14,270
factual evidence about the
amount of species that used
to exist during that time

1358
01:18:14,271 --> 01:18:15,170
that died off.

1359
01:18:15,690 --> 01:18:20,120
I got a huge percentage of all the
animals that were alive back then.

1360
01:18:20,220 --> 01:18:24,860
Our jobs are gone. That's just 10,000
years ago. It was like unbelievably scary.

1361
01:18:24,920 --> 01:18:27,620
It's just a cycle in a weird way.
It's not just a cycle.

1362
01:18:27,680 --> 01:18:31,460
He believes that it ended abruptly and
it probably ended because of a meteor

1363
01:18:31,461 --> 01:18:35,870
impact. That cycle was like
how people dealt with life.

1364
01:18:36,110 --> 01:18:38,540
They're just like those people
that live up in Edmonton. You know,

1365
01:18:38,541 --> 01:18:41,750
the people that were in a place like
Canada, the guy, there was nobody there.

1366
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:44,900
The reason why there's so few fucking
people in Canada and they're so cool,

1367
01:18:45,050 --> 01:18:47,030
it's because they've only been
there for a couple of hundred years.

1368
01:18:47,060 --> 01:18:50,000
Everything's fresh and new,
like a new chick fucking nobody there.

1369
01:18:50,001 --> 01:18:53,090
There was native Americans, you know,
some of them had ventured up there,

1370
01:18:54,110 --> 01:18:58,530
excuse me. But most of them, you know,
most of them fucking came, you know,

1371
01:18:58,820 --> 01:19:02,740
around the same time that settlers
came to North America, you know, the,

1372
01:19:02,741 --> 01:19:05,670
the Columbus days, that's
most of the, uh, the,

1373
01:19:05,671 --> 01:19:10,520
the people that wound up settling up
there in Canada before that man, not much.

1374
01:19:10,730 --> 01:19:12,430
And well, you know, why is
that? Because if you fuck,

1375
01:19:12,431 --> 01:19:17,360
a thousand years ago was under ice,
two miles giant glaciers do.

1376
01:19:17,370 --> 01:19:22,190
And I was there three feet dropped
the day I flew into of snow. I'm like,

1377
01:19:22,460 --> 01:19:23,320
this is insane.

1378
01:19:23,510 --> 01:19:28,310
Like giant walls of snow in between
each lane as you're driving where there

1379
01:19:28,311 --> 01:19:32,050
should have been like traffic,
little, little things, ma'am. Boom.

1380
01:19:32,090 --> 01:19:34,880
Just giant walls of snow.

1381
01:19:34,940 --> 01:19:37,480
And occasionally polar
bears and occasionally Paul,

1382
01:19:37,550 --> 01:19:41,780
I haven't seen one in Edmonton. Edmonton,
a woman was working on a rig recently.

1383
01:19:41,781 --> 01:19:46,190
She got killed, eaten alive by
a black bear. What? Yeah. Ah,

1384
01:19:46,220 --> 01:19:50,150
which is rare. Blackberries rezone
people, but if they catch you slipping

1385
01:19:51,710 --> 01:19:54,910
bears, you know, they'll
look at you though I might
be able to make this happen.

1386
01:19:54,911 --> 01:19:57,200
I mean the child down on
that tasty hot pocket,

1387
01:19:57,230 --> 01:19:59,810
you know what they're really
worried about. They're
really worried about hybrids.

1388
01:20:00,170 --> 01:20:03,710
Grizzlies and polar bears are
apparently getting their freak on little

1389
01:20:03,711 --> 01:20:08,160
interracial.
So hybrids

1390
01:20:08,190 --> 01:20:11,790
are very different than the regular grid
disaster. Stronger Blake Griffin's well,

1391
01:20:11,791 --> 01:20:14,850
they're more like polar bears
who are strictly carnivores.

1392
01:20:14,950 --> 01:20:18,120
So different seen a grizzly bear and a
polar bears. If you see a grizzly bear,

1393
01:20:18,510 --> 01:20:20,280
that bear might not give a fuck about you.

1394
01:20:20,430 --> 01:20:22,890
Have you see a grizzly bear out in
the fields and they're eating berries,

1395
01:20:23,100 --> 01:20:26,700
that bear might just look at go, I mean,
I don't give a fuck. It's plenty of food.

1396
01:20:26,701 --> 01:20:27,660
He's not hungry at all.

1397
01:20:27,780 --> 01:20:30,930
So the build a bear has a belly full
of berries and it's just sitting there

1398
01:20:30,931 --> 01:20:32,850
chewing along.
It doesn't give a fuck at all.

1399
01:20:33,060 --> 01:20:35,580
But if a grizzly bear sees
you and you're hungry,

1400
01:20:35,820 --> 01:20:38,970
is that the guy hanging out?
Yeah, it looks pretty good.

1401
01:20:39,290 --> 01:20:43,500
Kellogg mean Kellogg.
I think your chest tattoo.

1402
01:20:44,200 --> 01:20:47,700
Very Brock Lesnar is a new
thing I'm working on. Um,

1403
01:20:48,840 --> 01:20:52,710
a polar bear sees you.
You better run if not worth running.

1404
01:20:52,711 --> 01:20:55,290
Cause all polar bears do is eat meat.
That's all they do.

1405
01:20:55,291 --> 01:20:58,560
So anything that's moving a polar bear
is going to eat. There's no berries.

1406
01:20:58,620 --> 01:21:00,810
So I don't go where polar bears are.
That's a good move.

1407
01:21:00,870 --> 01:21:03,330
That's why I go with the La Jolla
California. That's a good move.

1408
01:21:03,490 --> 01:21:06,870
Where they laugh at me when I run there.
There's a polar bear den. The zoo though.

1409
01:21:07,260 --> 01:21:10,080
Careful that motherfucker gets out.
You're doomed. You will find me.

1410
01:21:10,081 --> 01:21:14,010
Cause he sees how slow I run.
He'll give you a thumbs up and let you go.

1411
01:21:14,640 --> 01:21:17,370
It's like when you see a retarded fish,
see a fisherwoman sideways.

1412
01:21:17,371 --> 01:21:21,780
You don't try to snag it. Let that
one go. That one going down river.

1413
01:21:21,820 --> 01:21:24,810
Did you see all the sardines that
are washing up in Venice right now?

1414
01:21:24,870 --> 01:21:29,400
I guess because the water got so hot
that it's oxygen and tons and tons and so

1415
01:21:29,401 --> 01:21:32,370
like now sharks are just dying and all
these fish keeper dying because there's

1416
01:21:32,371 --> 01:21:35,880
no oxygen. Cause there's so many
sardines. Yeah. They call it dead zones.

1417
01:21:35,881 --> 01:21:39,960
Apparently it happens all the time. And
the ocean smells like ass hole. Yeah,

1418
01:21:39,990 --> 01:21:42,500
it's bad. You know what
a good ass. I'll leave it

1419
01:21:42,650 --> 01:21:46,400
found out a way that they think they're
going to be able to bring back a plant

1420
01:21:46,401 --> 01:21:51,401
vegetation and shit in the ocean and a
sort of recede areas and a [inaudible]

1421
01:21:52,490 --> 01:21:57,490
the oxen and Jane the Ocean kitchenaid
and it involves dumping iron in the

1422
01:21:57,771 --> 01:22:02,420
water. Like iron scraps and iron
is a really interesting thing.

1423
01:22:02,421 --> 01:22:05,210
I read about it. I'll pull it up. Um, the,

1424
01:22:05,211 --> 01:22:10,211
the idea was that dumping iron into
the ocean would increase the amount of

1425
01:22:10,881 --> 01:22:15,881
plankton and that all these plants
would grow off of the a rusting iron.

1426
01:22:16,490 --> 01:22:21,170
Oh, the metal and the iron would
actually facilitate plant lysis. Yeah.

1427
01:22:21,200 --> 01:22:24,770
And that plant life would uh,
develop more oxygen in the ocean.

1428
01:22:24,940 --> 01:22:28,060
It was really kind of interesting
shit, man. Dumping Iron in the,

1429
01:22:28,270 --> 01:22:32,760
there are some people are way
smarter than I am. Yes. Yeah.

1430
01:22:32,761 --> 01:22:37,710
In this room, dude, I'm a human
being. I know. I hear you.

1431
01:22:37,711 --> 01:22:42,270
I have feelings. I know you do.
Thank you dude. Jesus Christ.

1432
01:22:42,271 --> 01:22:47,130
What do you need? Oh, cookie. There
I put it. Okay. Stop. That's enough.

1433
01:22:49,190 --> 01:22:51,650
Yeah.
Adding iron to the oceans.

1434
01:22:51,920 --> 01:22:55,310
They're slowing down global warming.
This is the idea

1435
01:22:56,840 --> 01:23:01,010
and they're throwing, this is a weird
fucking idea, but it kind of makes sense.

1436
01:23:01,070 --> 01:23:01,881
The premise is simple.

1437
01:23:01,881 --> 01:23:06,190
It says iron acts as a fertilizer
for many plants and some like the

1438
01:23:06,191 --> 01:23:10,120
phytoplankton that forms the base
line of marine food web need to grow.

1439
01:23:10,600 --> 01:23:14,740
They needed to grow and adding iron to
the water stimulates phytoplankton growth,

1440
01:23:14,741 --> 01:23:18,520
which in turn gobble up carbon
dioxide through photosynthesis.

1441
01:23:18,521 --> 01:23:23,521
This results in a decrease in carbon
dioxide and reduces temperature.

1442
01:23:24,011 --> 01:23:28,420
Since carbon dioxide is one of the main
gases responsible for trapping heat on

1443
01:23:28,421 --> 01:23:32,710
the earth's surface through the greenhouse
effect. Interesting. Unbelievable.

1444
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:34,360
There's interesting shit.
Yeah.

1445
01:23:34,361 --> 01:23:39,040
That's the other thing that this guy
Randall Carlson was talking about is how,

1446
01:23:39,160 --> 01:23:43,260
um, this, uh, increase in carbon
dioxide that we have there.

1447
01:23:43,261 --> 01:23:46,510
They're also directly correlating
it with an increase in plant growth,

1448
01:23:47,170 --> 01:23:51,250
which is kind of fucked because we
always think of like people adding carbon

1449
01:23:51,251 --> 01:23:55,030
dioxide to the air being a poison
and they were poisoning the air.

1450
01:23:55,180 --> 01:23:58,600
But the reality is that plants
need carbon dioxide to grow.

1451
01:23:59,140 --> 01:24:02,950
So it's not saying that you should go
out and burn carbon dioxide to fucking

1452
01:24:02,951 --> 01:24:07,000
help the plants, but it's one of
those things again where it's,

1453
01:24:07,030 --> 01:24:11,260
it's not black and white for station.

1454
01:24:11,290 --> 01:24:16,020
They're cutting down the plants mean
there's last plants to take in the CO2.

1455
01:24:16,030 --> 01:24:19,640
And that's where the problem is
right now. No, that's, no, but okay.

1456
01:24:19,930 --> 01:24:24,460
But what he's saying is there's more
forest than before that forests are

1457
01:24:24,461 --> 01:24:28,090
actually increasing in size and
there's more plants into the plant.

1458
01:24:28,091 --> 01:24:32,230
Growth is actually increasing because
of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

1459
01:24:32,380 --> 01:24:35,020
But there's definitely concern that
people have, like in the Amazon,

1460
01:24:35,021 --> 01:24:37,030
a lot of different places
that people are chopping down.

1461
01:24:37,230 --> 01:24:40,450
Well what the real problem with what
they're doing in the Amazon is that those,

1462
01:24:40,690 --> 01:24:43,810
they're changing the whole weather
system in those places because these,

1463
01:24:43,900 --> 01:24:46,780
these plants, they're responsible
for, like they're there,

1464
01:24:46,870 --> 01:24:50,230
the whole ecosystem is wrapped around
these plants and he chopped them down.

1465
01:24:50,230 --> 01:24:53,920
Then you have these dry areas is exposed
to the sun where they weren't exposed

1466
01:24:53,921 --> 01:24:57,640
to the sun before because this is
deep canopy of leaves and the rain,

1467
01:24:57,641 --> 01:25:01,870
the [inaudible], yeah, this is
just flat. And so then it becomes,

1468
01:25:01,900 --> 01:25:05,680
they don't have the root system. So then
you get mud slides and then though the,

1469
01:25:05,681 --> 01:25:08,860
the, uh, the ground, it becomes
very difficult to grow crops on it.

1470
01:25:09,160 --> 01:25:11,290
It's really kind of fucking crazy.
Like what they're doing.

1471
01:25:11,291 --> 01:25:16,230
They're just chopping down trees and
thousands and thousands of acres just damn

1472
01:25:17,220 --> 01:25:21,670
deforestation. Yeah, that's not
good. What about cows farting?

1473
01:25:21,671 --> 01:25:24,040
Do you ever buy into that?
That that's a big problem?

1474
01:25:24,041 --> 01:25:27,760
I always feel like they just picked
something that they could blame it on and

1475
01:25:28,130 --> 01:25:30,720
like there's way more people. No. But the,

1476
01:25:30,721 --> 01:25:34,330
the amount of impact that a cow has is
way more powerful than the amount of

1477
01:25:34,331 --> 01:25:38,740
impact that a person has. But
there's way more people. Yes.

1478
01:25:38,770 --> 01:25:41,380
Cow farts. Every cow,
there's probably what?

1479
01:25:41,710 --> 01:25:46,120
100200300 400 I don't know.
But here it says,

1480
01:25:46,121 --> 01:25:50,890
my dad can crushed scientists say cow
farts are more dangerous than they feared.

1481
01:25:51,550 --> 01:25:53,530
This is trip man.
There's a real study.

1482
01:25:53,740 --> 01:25:57,970
How'd he has revealed that the amount
of methane greenhouse gas 20 times more

1483
01:25:57,971 --> 01:26:01,260
potent, but far less prevalent
than CO2? Well, so it's,

1484
01:26:01,510 --> 01:26:04,250
it would be 20 cows to every person

1485
01:26:04,280 --> 01:26:07,130
to balance that out or 20
people to every cows rather.

1486
01:26:07,131 --> 01:26:11,690
It's about balance that out because it's
20 times more potent if a cow was the

1487
01:26:11,691 --> 01:26:13,730
size of a person,
but it cows way bigger than a person.

1488
01:26:13,731 --> 01:26:16,760
So it's even more so if is product
five times bigger than a person,

1489
01:26:16,900 --> 01:26:19,460
so instead of 20 times,
probably a hundred times more impact.

1490
01:26:19,790 --> 01:26:22,730
That's my unscientific calculation.

1491
01:26:22,740 --> 01:26:26,690
Cow Fart is 20 times in the environment.
That's crazy.

1492
01:26:26,691 --> 01:26:27,830
20 times more potent,

1493
01:26:27,831 --> 01:26:31,700
far less prevalent than CO2
released into the u s atmosphere.

1494
01:26:31,730 --> 01:26:34,160
It's significantly higher
than previously thought.

1495
01:26:34,670 --> 01:26:39,200
We find greenhouse gas emissions from
agricultural and fossil fuel extraction

1496
01:26:39,560 --> 01:26:41,740
and processing. Uh, I,

1497
01:26:41,750 --> 01:26:46,730
he oil or natural gas are likely a
factor of two or greater than cited in

1498
01:26:46,731 --> 01:26:47,840
existing studies.

1499
01:26:49,190 --> 01:26:53,480
So agriculture just by
itself is a big impact.

1500
01:26:53,750 --> 01:26:55,520
Unbelievable man.

1501
01:26:56,870 --> 01:27:01,790
Blessing methane is a fucking
issue though, man. When I
used to visit my parents,

1502
01:27:02,750 --> 01:27:04,340
my parents used to live in Pennsylvania.

1503
01:27:05,190 --> 01:27:09,320
I was driving from New York to a rural
Pennsylvania and there's this stretch of

1504
01:27:09,321 --> 01:27:13,520
highway where it's all farms,
dairy farms and slaughterhouses and shit,

1505
01:27:13,521 --> 01:27:14,480
I guess saw cows.

1506
01:27:14,690 --> 01:27:19,690
It's unbelievably bad smelling like you
can't imagine these poor fucking people

1507
01:27:20,391 --> 01:27:23,470
that have to live in these areas.
And it was hot. It was in the summer.

1508
01:27:23,710 --> 01:27:25,100
We'll just that it goes back to,

1509
01:27:25,101 --> 01:27:28,550
I've been to some people just accept
that I'm from kind of that area.

1510
01:27:28,940 --> 01:27:32,900
I'm from Cortland, New York, which
is, is a Pennsylvanian Cortland, ours.

1511
01:27:32,901 --> 01:27:35,400
Same kind of country. You know
what I'm saying? I got tough.

1512
01:27:35,750 --> 01:27:40,110
I have tons of cows in my hometown,
man. Really? Yeah. I mean,

1513
01:27:40,111 --> 01:27:43,580
I didn't realize how redneck my
hometown was until I left it.

1514
01:27:43,730 --> 01:27:45,230
What does it smell like when you go back?

1515
01:27:45,260 --> 01:27:49,970
Because they say that all factory senses
like the sense of smell is a newer

1516
01:27:49,971 --> 01:27:53,870
everywhere you can pack your senses. The
sense of smell is something that alters,

1517
01:27:54,260 --> 01:27:57,770
um, or it, it only picks
up a alterations and smell.

1518
01:27:57,890 --> 01:27:59,300
It doesn't pick up constant smells.

1519
01:27:59,480 --> 01:28:03,490
So if you live in a town town
stinks like some of those, uh,

1520
01:28:03,510 --> 01:28:05,990
industrial you ever been in New Jersey,

1521
01:28:06,170 --> 01:28:08,720
when you drive it through New Jersey
and you smell industrial pollution,

1522
01:28:09,050 --> 01:28:10,550
those towns,
they don't smell it.

1523
01:28:10,730 --> 01:28:14,240
You only smell it because you're driving
for fresh air or reasonably fresh air

1524
01:28:14,270 --> 01:28:17,150
into that area. That's how you used
to be. When I went to Niagara Falls,

1525
01:28:17,170 --> 01:28:21,560
had this giant factory called Hooker
Chemicals and that's what the name of it

1526
01:28:21,561 --> 01:28:22,730
was.
Hooker Chemicals.

1527
01:28:22,731 --> 01:28:26,300
And you would drive in and you're
like this day like saber plants,

1528
01:28:26,320 --> 01:28:30,470
paper stink like up in Portland. Now
here's the thing about hooker chemicals.

1529
01:28:30,471 --> 01:28:32,090
It's pretty much been closed down,

1530
01:28:32,091 --> 01:28:35,750
but they won't completely close it down
because if they completely close it down

1531
01:28:35,990 --> 01:28:37,640
then they're going to have to
go through and clean it up.

1532
01:28:37,670 --> 01:28:39,530
All the environmental cleanup.

1533
01:28:39,531 --> 01:28:44,531
So they just keep like 30
employees in this giant factory.

1534
01:28:45,111 --> 01:28:48,080
That's just huge.
And they just keep it open.

1535
01:28:48,081 --> 01:28:51,650
Hooker gets cheaper for them to do that
than it is for them to hire someone to

1536
01:28:51,651 --> 01:28:55,100
come in and clean it up. That makes
sense. There was something, a love canal.

1537
01:28:55,101 --> 01:28:58,970
Do you remember the old love canal?
A thing that's hooker chemicals.

1538
01:28:59,090 --> 01:29:03,900
They dumped all these these name company.
Yep. And they're still open. Yeah.

1539
01:29:04,110 --> 01:29:07,140
And they won't close it down because
then they have to clean up the

1540
01:29:07,141 --> 01:29:11,640
environmental mistakes.
That's awful. That's weird.

1541
01:29:11,641 --> 01:29:14,640
Did they let them get away
with that? Well I, yeah,

1542
01:29:14,650 --> 01:29:17,640
that's good because it's like a one of
those legacy companies cause it's been

1543
01:29:17,641 --> 01:29:20,160
around for a long time.
I think that's just probably the rule.

1544
01:29:20,161 --> 01:29:22,140
If you demolish or shut some down,

1545
01:29:22,141 --> 01:29:24,510
you've got to clean it up so
it's environmentally safe.

1546
01:29:24,510 --> 01:29:27,960
And so these guys just keep it
going cause it's cheaper to do that.

1547
01:29:27,961 --> 01:29:31,380
Dan is so fucked up.
That's so weird.

1548
01:29:31,800 --> 01:29:35,520
Well it's the same thing with like
GM right now with their cars. Right.

1549
01:29:35,521 --> 01:29:37,470
They'd like,
they knew forever.

1550
01:29:37,560 --> 01:29:40,920
Don't they do something where they like
they guesstimate how much it would cost

1551
01:29:40,921 --> 01:29:45,600
to do a recall versus how much it would
cost to go to court and if really yeah,

1552
01:29:45,601 --> 01:29:49,540
if something's cheaper they go with the
cheaper option. Oh Man, I'm not sure dude.

1553
01:29:49,590 --> 01:29:54,240
I'm not sure. I'm not sure.
I'm not sure about that.

1554
01:29:54,300 --> 01:29:58,100
I think they do that. I think that
was the big thing on uh, what was the,

1555
01:29:58,260 --> 01:30:02,910
what was it? You got to pull that shit up.
You can't just say that. That is, if, if,

1556
01:30:02,970 --> 01:30:07,560
if it's cheaper to go to court,

1557
01:30:08,580 --> 01:30:13,110
they'll go to court. But if it's Oh, you
shut. Shut the fuck up dude. Seriously.

1558
01:30:15,060 --> 01:30:18,300
Okay, I'll shut up. You got to
Google that. We can't say that.

1559
01:30:18,510 --> 01:30:20,190
You can't say that when it comes to cars,
man,

1560
01:30:20,270 --> 01:30:22,650
everything comes to any major corporation.

1561
01:30:22,830 --> 01:30:26,580
They'll do the re what's going to cause
us more a recall or going to the court

1562
01:30:26,610 --> 01:30:30,510
if it, if it recalls cheaper, they'll do
that if course cheaper than go to cheat.

1563
01:30:30,550 --> 01:30:33,620
I, I've heard it. I don't,
I'll put I think can't,

1564
01:30:33,630 --> 01:30:36,240
you can't just say that when
you say something like that.

1565
01:30:36,241 --> 01:30:39,870
Like you gotta really know what you're
saying. I do. I you're saying GM,

1566
01:30:39,871 --> 01:30:41,650
you're saying like a specific company.
Yes.

1567
01:30:41,730 --> 01:30:44,760
Somebody might have gotten in
trouble for some sort of recall,

1568
01:30:44,761 --> 01:30:49,000
but it could've been a safety
issue. Google that. Okay.
I'll Google it right now.

1569
01:30:49,001 --> 01:30:52,710
So let me Google it. Gm. Am I saying okay.

1570
01:30:52,890 --> 01:30:57,450
Avoids recall. Look Google, Google,

1571
01:30:57,451 --> 01:31:01,500
whether corporations decide
whether recall or court is cheaper,

1572
01:31:01,650 --> 01:31:05,100
they go with the cheaper option. Can
you do that? I'm doing that right now.

1573
01:31:05,380 --> 01:31:09,230
It's from a movie cause
I remember something like
that like like right now and

1574
01:31:09,231 --> 01:31:11,760
there's not enough people that are
having the problem so we're not going to

1575
01:31:11,761 --> 01:31:16,640
worry about it. They, they guesstimate
if it's cheaper for them too.

1576
01:31:16,750 --> 01:31:20,040
You can't just say that.
Here's the problem with just
saying something like that.

1577
01:31:20,280 --> 01:31:21,900
You have to really know
what the fuck you're saying.

1578
01:31:22,680 --> 01:31:25,440
You've got to really know what you're
saying because if you just say it,

1579
01:31:25,441 --> 01:31:29,790
then you don't have to do that anymore.
It's 2014 it did actually find out.

1580
01:31:29,791 --> 01:31:32,700
So if you want to talk about something
and you want to talk about something as

1581
01:31:32,701 --> 01:31:37,170
serious as someone not doing a recall
because they'd rather just like get sued

1582
01:31:37,171 --> 01:31:40,230
because they can save money that way you
gotta know what the fuck you're saying.

1583
01:31:40,260 --> 01:31:41,550
But I'm saying now I know that.

1584
01:31:41,551 --> 01:31:44,340
But you don't know that because
you're not pulling up any facts.

1585
01:31:44,490 --> 01:31:48,600
You're not stating any guys in here. The
super computer, which was great hair.

1586
01:31:48,601 --> 01:31:51,420
Dawn is some legacy shit.
You don't have to do that anymore.

1587
01:31:51,421 --> 01:31:54,450
You have a fucking iPhone. You know
how to get online. Battery's dead. Oh,

1588
01:31:54,451 --> 01:31:58,710
we'll plug it in. So it's an old one.
Oh, well you fucking cheap bastard.

1589
01:31:59,640 --> 01:31:59,980
Go get a

1590
01:31:59,980 --> 01:32:02,320
new one.
When they get done with this.

1591
01:32:02,530 --> 01:32:06,880
I'm sure there's been some
problems with, uh, oversight.

1592
01:32:06,910 --> 01:32:09,340
I'm sure there's been some
problems with recalls,

1593
01:32:09,670 --> 01:32:13,960
but saying that they like actively got
together and said, hey, let's just, uh,

1594
01:32:14,020 --> 01:32:17,770
not fucking, let's just not recall
these things and just take our role,

1595
01:32:17,771 --> 01:32:21,910
our chances with the lawsuit because the
study has shown that we can save money

1596
01:32:21,911 --> 01:32:24,760
if we go that route. I believe
that's what happened. I have no,

1597
01:32:24,761 --> 01:32:29,290
can't just say that. Okay. I
will. That's how you get sued.

1598
01:32:29,350 --> 01:32:31,900
I understand that you could get
sued, Sam. What if they come, what?

1599
01:32:31,960 --> 01:32:35,710
GM comes down with the hammer of the law?
Well, they can take what I don't have.

1600
01:32:35,830 --> 01:32:40,180
Why would you say that you have a
number 11 on the fuck it's called.

1601
01:32:40,181 --> 01:32:44,920
You can do it for the move. You believe in
yourself. Believe in yourself. Go Rocky.

1602
01:32:45,040 --> 01:32:49,480
When rocky, believe in
yourself. Believe in yourself.

1603
01:32:49,481 --> 01:32:52,220
Do you ever thought about doing a
song like a wacky songs go along with,

1604
01:32:52,420 --> 01:32:55,000
I do like red bands, great
songs though. He has a,

1605
01:32:55,660 --> 01:32:59,380
he should do some live music songs.
Gm says safety is our top priority.

1606
01:32:59,381 --> 01:33:03,460
And today's announcement
puts all manufacturers on
notice that they will be held

1607
01:33:03,461 --> 01:33:08,260
accountable if they fail to quickly
report and address safety related defects.

1608
01:33:08,710 --> 01:33:11,870
Oh, this is us transportation
secretary secretary, uh,

1609
01:33:12,070 --> 01:33:13,960
Anthony Fox with two exes.

1610
01:33:14,620 --> 01:33:18,940
He said he would continue to aggressively
monitor GM efforts in this case and

1611
01:33:18,941 --> 01:33:23,020
called on Congress to support a
move to increase the penalties.

1612
01:33:23,021 --> 01:33:28,021
The regulator can levy in cases like this
from a maximum of 35,000 or 35 million

1613
01:33:28,871 --> 01:33:29,980
to 300 million,

1614
01:33:30,520 --> 01:33:34,270
sending an even stronger message
that delays will not be tolerated.

1615
01:33:34,630 --> 01:33:37,120
So this is what they're saying.
The GM was fine.

1616
01:33:37,150 --> 01:33:40,900
35 million bucks and agreed to take
part in an unprecedented oversight

1617
01:33:41,440 --> 01:33:43,050
requirements,
um,

1618
01:33:43,630 --> 01:33:48,220
on Friday over its massive recall of
cars with faulty ignition switches that

1619
01:33:48,221 --> 01:33:49,840
have been linked to 13 deaths.

1620
01:33:50,110 --> 01:33:54,550
The U s department of Transportation
imposed the records civil penalty for the

1621
01:33:54,551 --> 01:33:58,880
automobile makers, a failure to
report a safety defect in the,

1622
01:33:59,110 --> 01:34:02,020
in the vehicle to the federal
government in a timely manner.

1623
01:34:02,140 --> 01:34:04,270
So it didn't report it in time.
What does that mean?

1624
01:34:04,570 --> 01:34:07,600
Did they find out that it was bad
and didn't report it into the scene?

1625
01:34:07,601 --> 01:34:09,670
John Oliver's new show,
but hold on. I'm sorry.

1626
01:34:09,671 --> 01:34:11,800
We should figure this out because we've
been talking about this for a while.

1627
01:34:11,801 --> 01:34:13,360
It has something to do with that.
We'll go ahead and talk.

1628
01:34:13,530 --> 01:34:16,710
All right, well here I found it an
article to help you out. Sam, on Ge, uh,

1629
01:34:16,720 --> 01:34:21,700
justice.org, there's a, uh, they
all knew and failed to pdf. Uh,

1630
01:34:21,710 --> 01:34:23,890
it's called, uh, they knew and failed to.

1631
01:34:24,070 --> 01:34:26,920
And these are true stories of
corporations that knew their products were

1632
01:34:26,921 --> 01:34:29,620
dangerous, sometimes deadly, but
they failed to do anything about it.

1633
01:34:29,621 --> 01:34:32,920
And one of the things it says is that car
company that discovers that if it does

1634
01:34:32,921 --> 01:34:36,070
not spend $11 per car to fix a defect,

1635
01:34:36,100 --> 01:34:39,820
a hundreds of people be horribly burned
and decides it would be cheaper to let

1636
01:34:39,821 --> 01:34:43,120
them burn. What company did
that? I don't know, but it's a,

1637
01:34:43,121 --> 01:34:45,890
it's on justice.org though. If
there's a whole pdf, wait a minute,

1638
01:34:46,030 --> 01:34:50,260
we got to read that. It says, it actually
says that right here. What company?

1639
01:34:50,290 --> 01:34:55,150
A car company just has a car company
and it goes through all of it.

1640
01:34:55,600 --> 01:34:58,600
Like here's medical devices like
heart defibrillators that, that,

1641
01:34:58,601 --> 01:35:01,220
that the title of it
again, uh, it's called,

1642
01:35:01,250 --> 01:35:05,790
they all they knew and failed to a true,
true stories of course,

1643
01:35:05,820 --> 01:35:08,670
operations that knew their products
were dangerous, sometimes deadly.

1644
01:35:08,700 --> 01:35:13,230
So as far as a, this GM thing, it looks
like they definitely fucked up. Well,

1645
01:35:13,231 --> 01:35:16,740
you know, the reason I brought
John Oliver because he got,

1646
01:35:16,800 --> 01:35:21,630
he was talking about these memos in which
they would tell their employees words

1647
01:35:21,631 --> 01:35:24,150
they could not use.
And it's crazy.

1648
01:35:24,151 --> 01:35:28,950
Like they knew that these were death
traps and that they were telling their

1649
01:35:28,951 --> 01:35:29,970
employees, you, you know,

1650
01:35:29,971 --> 01:35:34,860
you can't say certain words about
the cars to describe to cars.

1651
01:35:34,861 --> 01:35:38,080
And they were like insane
words like Kevorkian,

1652
01:35:38,081 --> 01:35:40,350
NASC and stuff like that.

1653
01:35:40,610 --> 01:35:45,410
Here's one from Firestone tires.
Uh, I guess that they, uh,

1654
01:35:45,470 --> 01:35:49,270
they knew their tires are bad. Yeah,
I remember that too. I think. Oh,

1655
01:35:49,340 --> 01:35:53,120
they finally announced they knew about
it in 1997 and then finally announced in

1656
01:35:53,121 --> 01:35:54,950
two thousands.
Uh,

1657
01:35:55,340 --> 01:35:58,500
you know, I think that that
was a different era. You
know, that sounds crazy.

1658
01:35:58,501 --> 01:36:02,970
But 1996, 1997, like comparing
that to 2014, I mean,

1659
01:36:02,971 --> 01:36:05,190
I know there was only 20
years ago or 18 years ago,

1660
01:36:05,340 --> 01:36:08,370
but didn't it fascinating that that might
as well been a hundred fucking years

1661
01:36:08,370 --> 01:36:08,460
ago

1662
01:36:08,460 --> 01:36:10,570
that cause that was all pre
and in terms of the internet,

1663
01:36:10,740 --> 01:36:13,830
Morton Pinto, remember the Pinto when
it, we used to blow up all the time.

1664
01:36:14,760 --> 01:36:19,390
They found out they actually had a
chart where it says the 180 burned desks

1665
01:36:19,400 --> 01:36:21,660
would be 200,000 per death.

1666
01:36:21,661 --> 01:36:24,030
And then they just added up
how much it would cost to that.

1667
01:36:24,031 --> 01:36:27,910
And to recall a $11 perch car with uh,

1668
01:36:28,410 --> 01:36:30,510
looks like 11 million cars and

1669
01:36:31,680 --> 01:36:34,230
affiliated it.
Also the calculated severe burns,

1670
01:36:34,231 --> 01:36:39,231
serious burns 2,100 burn vehicles
and it all came to 49.5 million.

1671
01:36:40,080 --> 01:36:44,790
Whether, but if to recall 11
million cars came to 137 million.

1672
01:36:45,040 --> 01:36:45,873
God,

1673
01:36:45,990 --> 01:36:48,510
God, that's unbelievable. You know,

1674
01:36:48,520 --> 01:36:52,990
the whole thing was at GM
was trading their, their,

1675
01:36:53,260 --> 01:36:55,900
their, their people, their employees,

1676
01:36:56,170 --> 01:37:00,040
how to answer these questions,
how to deflect,

1677
01:37:00,041 --> 01:37:03,610
how to do all this stuff because
they knew they had a faulty thing.

1678
01:37:03,670 --> 01:37:05,050
And when was this,
uh,

1679
01:37:05,051 --> 01:37:08,890
this was when they discovered
the faulty part in their car?

1680
01:37:09,470 --> 01:37:11,960
Well, the, the, the, uh, actual, uh,

1681
01:37:11,990 --> 01:37:16,990
thing was an ignition switch that disabled
the airbags and the Chevy cobalt and

1682
01:37:18,141 --> 01:37:20,870
a Saturn ion. Did you have a
Saturday night on what do you have?

1683
01:37:21,020 --> 01:37:23,020
Did you have one of those a
long time ago? Saturday. Sunday.

1684
01:37:23,140 --> 01:37:24,340
Oh,
it's Saturday an l 200.

1685
01:37:25,090 --> 01:37:29,020
Oh, in the, uh, ion in the cobalt.
They knew about it for 10 years.

1686
01:37:30,130 --> 01:37:31,120
Chevy Malibu,

1687
01:37:31,240 --> 01:37:35,050
a general motors and new
for several decades that the
placement of the fuel tank

1688
01:37:35,051 --> 01:37:39,370
and a Chevy Malibu created
a big risk exploding in the
event of a rear collision.

1689
01:37:39,610 --> 01:37:41,710
So for a couple of decades
they knew that that was,

1690
01:37:41,850 --> 01:37:44,340
I never even heard about that with the
Malibu. I was hurting with the Pinto.

1691
01:37:44,341 --> 01:37:47,320
That was like a joke. Yeah. The Pinto
would blow up. That was the, yeah,

1692
01:37:47,680 --> 01:37:48,513
I remember that.

1693
01:37:48,720 --> 01:37:53,270
Still use the pinto as a punchline
the other day and I'm like, dude,

1694
01:37:53,271 --> 01:37:56,790
nobody gets that. And
that reference, hipster,

1695
01:37:56,791 --> 01:38:01,540
ironic at this point. It's kind of
hipster, ironic old Milwaukee beer. Yeah.

1696
01:38:02,070 --> 01:38:02,431
Yeah.

1697
01:38:02,431 --> 01:38:07,431
So I mean that's his craziest when
people start picking cash over lives.

1698
01:38:07,550 --> 01:38:11,070
That makes it sad. Hmm.
Well, it's just fucking evil.

1699
01:38:11,100 --> 01:38:14,100
Does it now that paper that you saw,
that was an internal paper,

1700
01:38:14,101 --> 01:38:15,180
is that what that was?
Yeah.

1701
01:38:15,181 --> 01:38:20,181
This is actually from a court records
where GM actually decided that they could

1702
01:38:20,311 --> 01:38:22,860
have up to 500 fatalities per year.

1703
01:38:22,890 --> 01:38:27,890
Each fatalities valued at $200,000
there are approximately 41 million GM

1704
01:38:29,281 --> 01:38:32,380
automobiles currently operating on
the US highways, and so they had,

1705
01:38:32,610 --> 01:38:34,080
they were like,
you know,

1706
01:38:34,170 --> 01:38:38,670
doing the math on the cable where they
doing the math about a particular issue,

1707
01:38:38,730 --> 01:38:42,830
Chevy Mal, but yet the amount when
it blows up. Oh, thank God. Yeah.

1708
01:38:42,920 --> 01:38:45,060
It's so awful.
I don't want to ever buy a Chevy again.

1709
01:38:45,340 --> 01:38:48,760
I don't want to ever buy a Ford again
either because the Ford fucking horrible.

1710
01:38:48,990 --> 01:38:50,940
Let's not the same people anymore.
Obviously,

1711
01:38:50,970 --> 01:38:54,510
obviously it's a totally different
group people, but still it's like, okay,

1712
01:38:54,511 --> 01:38:57,090
what is it?
What do we do?

1713
01:38:57,091 --> 01:39:00,930
We do we recall or is it going to be
cheaper just to go to court and deal with

1714
01:39:00,931 --> 01:39:03,250
lawsuits? And that's what
sucks. It's kind of like,

1715
01:39:04,860 --> 01:39:05,180
it's,

1716
01:39:05,180 --> 01:39:07,620
it's Kinda like one of those things that
I don't think is going to be around the

1717
01:39:07,621 --> 01:39:11,520
future. Uh, I think with like wikileaks
and shit along these lines, like you're,

1718
01:39:11,521 --> 01:39:14,130
you're not going to be able to get away
with that and not gonna be able to get

1719
01:39:14,131 --> 01:39:17,250
away with saying that someone's
life is worth $200,000.

1720
01:39:17,251 --> 01:39:20,970
And so we have x amount of dollars
invested here and you know,

1721
01:39:21,120 --> 01:39:25,710
we'd say 50 million if we just let these
people burns. Unbelievable. You all, they,

1722
01:39:25,840 --> 01:39:29,810
they should hang them by their ankles
in a, in a fucking room fold with Rad.

1723
01:39:29,860 --> 01:39:34,290
Do you think there's a level of like
psychopath that you have to get to be like

1724
01:39:34,291 --> 01:39:39,291
super high up in a corporation
where people become just numbers?

1725
01:39:42,510 --> 01:39:46,890
I think people definitely can justify
a lot of shit. Like you have to,

1726
01:39:46,980 --> 01:39:51,980
you have to detach from humanity and look
at people as numbers and resources and

1727
01:39:53,221 --> 01:39:57,150
all that, whether it's super high up, a
military, super high up and corporations,

1728
01:39:57,330 --> 01:40:00,370
any corporations. I'm not just
saying like, you know, uh,

1729
01:40:00,420 --> 01:40:04,860
oil corporations even just like high
up in entertainment, like, you know,

1730
01:40:04,861 --> 01:40:07,290
it's like sometimes I'll have to,
no, you don't have to be there.

1731
01:40:07,530 --> 01:40:12,040
But definitely a lot of the people
that get there are, yeah. But, but

1732
01:40:12,090 --> 01:40:14,730
I think that's all a lot of
that is going to be in the past.

1733
01:40:14,731 --> 01:40:16,710
I think it's still going on
right now to a certain extent.

1734
01:40:17,160 --> 01:40:20,850
But transparency is making it more and
more difficult to get away with shit like

1735
01:40:20,851 --> 01:40:24,600
that. You know? It's just, it's gonna
make it more and more difficult to hide.

1736
01:40:24,601 --> 01:40:28,350
What the fuck you did. You know, when
you were talking about things like this,

1737
01:40:28,590 --> 01:40:31,140
I don't think you can hide this
anymore, man. That's why, you know,

1738
01:40:31,141 --> 01:40:33,960
going back to what we're talking about,
all the hackers and all that stuff,

1739
01:40:33,990 --> 01:40:37,230
that's why like when this net
neutrality stuff is coming up, I'm like,

1740
01:40:37,410 --> 01:40:40,230
I just don't think the hackers
will let that happen. Well,

1741
01:40:40,231 --> 01:40:43,590
they're going to have to for a while, but
they're already fighting back. One Dude,

1742
01:40:43,591 --> 01:40:48,180
uh, hacked into the, uh, FC FEC,
SCC. SCC, right. That's what it is.

1743
01:40:48,240 --> 01:40:51,450
FCC, no. Federal Communications.
Is that what it is?

1744
01:40:51,750 --> 01:40:54,940
They are responsible for the Internet.
Yeah. Well they're the ones making the,

1745
01:40:55,450 --> 01:41:00,070
whether they're going to let time Warner
and what was the other one? Verizon,

1746
01:41:00,110 --> 01:41:04,840
Verizon, whatever. Ones can be huge. A
T and t is about to buy direct TV. Yeah.

1747
01:41:04,841 --> 01:41:08,530
And they're freaking out about that.
But doesn't that go,

1748
01:41:08,531 --> 01:41:11,320
who does that go back to?
Was that Clinton,

1749
01:41:11,500 --> 01:41:15,910
they've just made it so that every,
you know, they could consolidate more.

1750
01:41:16,270 --> 01:41:19,980
I'm trying to do that. But
the, the point about the, what,

1751
01:41:19,981 --> 01:41:22,390
what they're doing with the FCC is a,

1752
01:41:22,391 --> 01:41:25,480
that these hackers attacked the,

1753
01:41:25,481 --> 01:41:29,590
a SCCs website and turn
the FCC website down to 28,

1754
01:41:29,591 --> 01:41:33,520
eight like an old school, 28 eight
pit Mod Modem. So they, they,

1755
01:41:33,540 --> 01:41:37,180
they throttled them down. I love, this
is what this what it's like stupid.

1756
01:41:37,510 --> 01:41:41,530
Like you can't do this. This
is ridiculous. Yeah. Well
basically making it so, uh,

1757
01:41:41,560 --> 01:41:42,100
you know,

1758
01:41:42,100 --> 01:41:45,370
certain websites you can get to quicker
and then if they won't find mine,

1759
01:41:45,371 --> 01:41:48,700
it's going to take forever for them
to find where it is. It's evil,

1760
01:41:48,970 --> 01:41:53,380
it's evil and it's just another
opportunity that people have to corrupt

1761
01:41:53,381 --> 01:41:56,710
something to make some money off of
it. So people do, if you let them,

1762
01:41:56,800 --> 01:41:59,080
if you let them, but I
think transparency, again,

1763
01:41:59,081 --> 01:42:02,110
like this is something they would have
pulled off in the 80s like that no one

1764
01:42:02,111 --> 01:42:05,170
would have had a say about it.
No one would have even known about it.

1765
01:42:05,171 --> 01:42:07,360
Maybe a few protests on schools.
Yeah.

1766
01:42:07,361 --> 01:42:09,310
You'd be walking through the
campus and someone would be like,

1767
01:42:09,520 --> 01:42:13,090
save net neutrality. He'd be like,
Oh, save the whales, save the CEO's.

1768
01:42:13,091 --> 01:42:14,500
I got to go to class. You know, you would,

1769
01:42:14,530 --> 01:42:17,440
you would sort of like be into it
for a little bit but not really.

1770
01:42:17,440 --> 01:42:20,410
Totally understand it. Whereas now
it's like hitting your email every day.

1771
01:42:20,411 --> 01:42:23,110
Twitter every day. And my constant
here and about net neutrality,

1772
01:42:23,111 --> 01:42:24,340
I'm constantly hearing about it.

1773
01:42:24,700 --> 01:42:28,810
So it's this different thing where I
think today it's way hard to cover shit up

1774
01:42:28,811 --> 01:42:29,920
and the people that are involved,

1775
01:42:30,100 --> 01:42:33,850
the last thing those motherfuckers want
to do is be up for any public office or

1776
01:42:33,851 --> 01:42:36,520
being, you know, applying
for any sort of a job.

1777
01:42:36,521 --> 01:42:40,480
And explain your role without
eliminating net neutrality.

1778
01:42:40,660 --> 01:42:44,170
And what was your position? Well, he sent
the guy that who's in charge of the FCC,

1779
01:42:44,171 --> 01:42:46,930
like used to work at like
time Warner or something,

1780
01:42:46,931 --> 01:42:51,250
has something where it's like he was
high up and the customer is the king of,

1781
01:42:51,251 --> 01:42:54,110
has a co sort of an idea what's going on.
His head

1782
01:42:54,250 --> 01:42:56,650
isn't the guy where's the dresses?

1783
01:42:56,830 --> 01:43:01,510
Isn't Wolverine Holding hands with guys?
I've been so far though,

1784
01:43:01,511 --> 01:43:04,410
with the exception of the Wolverine,
I've been right on everything else,

1785
01:43:04,690 --> 01:43:05,560
right about wolverine.

1786
01:43:05,590 --> 01:43:08,290
And you know where he got the car thing
for him by the way, where it costs money.

1787
01:43:08,291 --> 01:43:10,480
I think you got that from
fight club that cause that

1788
01:43:11,710 --> 01:43:12,910
character.
Actually

1789
01:43:17,480 --> 01:43:19,860
I read that. I read, I read it

1790
01:43:20,130 --> 01:43:22,170
occasionally. Come on son.
How often do you read,

1791
01:43:22,590 --> 01:43:25,470
now I'm reading a book about the
Guy who thought his dad was the,

1792
01:43:25,510 --> 01:43:28,530
might've been the Zodiac killer.
Oh you seem that were really reading that,

1793
01:43:28,940 --> 01:43:29,190
you know,

1794
01:43:29,190 --> 01:43:34,020
he's not the first and several of them
thinking that their dads were the Zodiac

1795
01:43:34,021 --> 01:43:37,940
killer by, have you seen that
picture of his dad versus the sketch?

1796
01:43:38,070 --> 01:43:40,470
That's identical. Really? Oh yeah.

1797
01:43:40,590 --> 01:43:44,790
Imagine if your dad was out killing
other people and you were worried that he

1798
01:43:44,791 --> 01:43:47,730
was going to get you, but you want
to keep your mouth shut about.

1799
01:43:47,731 --> 01:43:52,040
Unbelievable because he's your dad
bullying. Well, the work, cause I bought

1800
01:43:52,040 --> 01:43:54,560
the book. Hmm. Did you
hear about that killer? Uh,

1801
01:43:54,561 --> 01:43:57,530
the guy from shield that just killed
his wife in front of the kids today.

1802
01:43:57,550 --> 01:44:00,530
The one actor a shield.
Think he was the guy.

1803
01:44:00,531 --> 01:44:03,690
He was the black lab cost guy right here.
Watch.

1804
01:44:03,750 --> 01:44:07,910
Remember fucking way.
I was on the news last night.

1805
01:44:07,911 --> 01:44:12,360
They showed him my tough God. No, he
killed his wife in front of their kids,

1806
01:44:12,510 --> 01:44:14,510
the kids,
and it was over a money problems.

1807
01:44:14,511 --> 01:44:19,040
I guess he filed for bankruptcy recently.
Oh, he had stopped paying off his house.

1808
01:44:19,870 --> 01:44:23,260
Ah,
fuck.

1809
01:44:23,440 --> 01:44:27,490
What is it about people I shot my wife.
What?

1810
01:44:27,610 --> 01:44:30,580
How do people get to that place?
Where do you get the kill?

1811
01:44:30,581 --> 01:44:33,790
Somebody that they loved at least
at one point in time, loved.

1812
01:44:33,940 --> 01:44:38,200
How do you get so low bankruptcy
problems? That's really, that's that.

1813
01:44:38,201 --> 01:44:43,030
Did you got to the point where you were
on fucking the shield so you don't get

1814
01:44:43,031 --> 01:44:46,870
back? Everybody was on one of the best
cop shows ever, so you don't get back.

1815
01:44:47,050 --> 01:44:51,130
Do you see it fucking guy who was just
has a normal life freaking out because he,

1816
01:44:51,640 --> 01:44:56,500
wow, look at them. They're man, Jesus
Christ. It's over. That is so crazy.

1817
01:44:56,530 --> 01:45:00,880
You imagine how crazy that guy has to
be to have just shot his fucking wife.

1818
01:45:01,030 --> 01:45:05,350
He goes from being on like one of the
all time greatest cop shows has a crazy

1819
01:45:05,351 --> 01:45:08,440
role on it. A really good role.
Like here's the gay guy, remember

1820
01:45:10,030 --> 01:45:12,970
man, you think that's
drugs also? Who knows, man.

1821
01:45:13,890 --> 01:45:18,300
I've heard stories about that people
owe Dan and their kids are in the house,

1822
01:45:18,301 --> 01:45:22,560
got hanging themselves. Kids are in the
house. It's like what are you doing dude

1823
01:45:24,090 --> 01:45:26,250
killing the wife man. Some, no. So,

1824
01:45:26,430 --> 01:45:31,410
so much more common than the wife killed
the husband. That's a fucking awful,

1825
01:45:31,830 --> 01:45:33,860
awful shit man. Real. Yes,

1826
01:45:33,870 --> 01:45:38,820
he was a file bankruptcy and his house
was about to go in foreclosure. Oh butter,

1827
01:45:38,821 --> 01:45:43,390
kill my wife.
It's not only ready to get a job or kids,

1828
01:45:43,400 --> 01:45:47,010
it's like the thing where people hit
that wall where they don't have any other

1829
01:45:47,011 --> 01:45:50,670
solution and you know, someone will say,
oh it's depression. You know it's, yeah,

1830
01:45:50,700 --> 01:45:54,630
okay, I get it. But how
does it make you kill them

1831
01:45:54,700 --> 01:45:57,300
now? There's no solution
and silver. I mean,

1832
01:45:57,310 --> 01:46:00,610
cause he called nine one one and said it.
Oh my God,

1833
01:46:00,760 --> 01:46:03,310
that's going to be used against them.
I mean like, what are you going to do?

1834
01:46:05,460 --> 01:46:08,350
Who knows, man? It's like, what do
you deal with that? I mean, it's like,

1835
01:46:08,351 --> 01:46:10,990
I'm not married, ma'am.
I just seen these guys.

1836
01:46:10,991 --> 01:46:13,770
He's married guys that are just like,
the only way out is to often,

1837
01:46:13,780 --> 01:46:18,160
it's always the always the
husband. So he's just so, you know,

1838
01:46:18,161 --> 01:46:20,410
it's like so funny because, well,
it's not always the husband.

1839
01:46:20,440 --> 01:46:23,030
I mean it's more often the
husband more often. Yeah,

1840
01:46:23,040 --> 01:46:26,710
like people that I know where the
guy in the woman, you know it was,

1841
01:46:26,720 --> 01:46:30,910
it was Phil Hartman was killed
by his wife, wasn't she?

1842
01:46:32,710 --> 01:46:37,420
Yeah, sure what? Yes he was. Yes, I heard
that. Awesome. Heard it all day. All Day.

1843
01:46:38,640 --> 01:46:43,300
She was on Zoloft and cocaine.
And when does she eat an ex escort?

1844
01:46:43,540 --> 01:46:47,230
I don't know how it goes.
I'm sure people have alleged that,

1845
01:46:48,550 --> 01:46:52,800
but you know, she'd go and fuck a guy
for dinner. Basically. You're an escort.

1846
01:46:53,130 --> 01:46:56,070
A lot of escorts out there.
God bless him. You know,

1847
01:46:56,071 --> 01:46:57,090
there's a lot of girls that go like,

1848
01:46:57,160 --> 01:47:00,920
go on dates with guys and that and that
for a free meal. Why not fucking them.

1849
01:47:00,921 --> 01:47:04,320
Just because they feel bad. He got
went out and bought drinks and dinner.

1850
01:47:04,530 --> 01:47:07,800
That's real. It does happen. I don't
encourage him, but it does happen.

1851
01:47:08,670 --> 01:47:12,420
You don't need to fuck a guy for dinner.
Joey Diaz has a funny joke about that,

1852
01:47:13,140 --> 01:47:17,760
about the Liberace movie. I don't
think he does it anymore, but he uh,

1853
01:47:17,820 --> 01:47:21,810
he goes, uh, he goes, he goes, if a, if
somebody buys you dinner and he goes,

1854
01:47:21,811 --> 01:47:25,560
you don't have to fuck them.
But if you fly a person out somewhere,

1855
01:47:25,590 --> 01:47:29,460
he was talking about Liberace flying that
guy out to Vegas. He goes, you fly outs,

1856
01:47:29,580 --> 01:47:34,450
someone's getting the Dick
sock. Yeah. This is different.

1857
01:47:34,451 --> 01:47:36,030
This gene,
someone visiting you.

1858
01:47:36,060 --> 01:47:39,030
That's like what people always have an
issue with like a girl flying out to hang

1859
01:47:39,031 --> 01:47:42,950
out with a guy and see the weekend I've
had the comics have heard that happened

1860
01:47:42,951 --> 01:47:46,690
to them. Like they meet a
girl on the road. Like, man,
I think she's really cool.

1861
01:47:46,920 --> 01:47:48,660
She's going to come out and visit me.
We'll see what's up.

1862
01:47:48,870 --> 01:47:52,020
And the girl flies out to visit them.
And then nothing.

1863
01:47:52,470 --> 01:47:55,470
I had a buddy who in the hell fluid chick,

1864
01:47:55,890 --> 01:48:00,710
he met a chick here in La
Fluor to Toronto. She took
the flight, got to truck,

1865
01:48:00,720 --> 01:48:04,800
cause she's from Toronto, got there,
never called him, never hung out.

1866
01:48:04,980 --> 01:48:08,730
He kept calling her like, where
are you? She like did, no, I can't.

1867
01:48:08,731 --> 01:48:10,110
I can't hook up right now.

1868
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:15,630
She uses them for a plane ticket. Hey,
there's unscrupulous people out there.

1869
01:48:15,930 --> 01:48:20,280
Some of them have vaginas. Yeah. Some of
them have penises. Yup. No one's immune.

1870
01:48:20,430 --> 01:48:23,490
Yup. Some of them are crazy. Comes
in all sizes. Some of them are gay,

1871
01:48:24,060 --> 01:48:25,410
some of them are transgender.

1872
01:48:25,950 --> 01:48:29,670
There's some fucking shady people
out there in all walks of life.

1873
01:48:29,700 --> 01:48:33,510
What do you think about the word tranny?
Transgender and all that stuff.

1874
01:48:33,590 --> 01:48:35,760
I think of it's okay to call a cab driver.
A cabbie.

1875
01:48:36,020 --> 01:48:40,200
She'd be able to call a transgender a
training. It's just an abbreviation.

1876
01:48:42,210 --> 01:48:46,170
I don't think it's, I believe intent. I
think what we were talking about earlier,

1877
01:48:46,171 --> 01:48:49,560
like when you're talking about
what, what is rape? You know,

1878
01:48:49,561 --> 01:48:53,010
we all know what's bad.
When you define something by a name,

1879
01:48:53,120 --> 01:48:54,390
you know when you say like,
Oh,

1880
01:48:54,391 --> 01:48:56,700
you have a couple of drinks and then
you have sex with somebody that's rape,

1881
01:48:57,150 --> 01:48:57,983
they have sex with you,

1882
01:48:57,990 --> 01:49:00,630
it's rape because you've had three
drinks or we have two drinks.

1883
01:49:00,631 --> 01:49:05,400
Now it becomes rape. I think defining
people like this is this, this guy,

1884
01:49:05,430 --> 01:49:10,110
oh, he's a fag. Oh, this guy, oh, he's
a homo, this guy. Oh, he's gay man.

1885
01:49:10,140 --> 01:49:13,840
Like what do you, what's in your
mind? What's the intent? Yeah.

1886
01:49:13,890 --> 01:49:17,340
What's your in your mind when
you know, if Justin Martin, Dale,

1887
01:49:17,341 --> 01:49:19,250
we're here and we're like,
well,

1888
01:49:19,251 --> 01:49:23,040
if homeowners like you could stop
fucking monkeys, what would we be doing?

1889
01:49:23,040 --> 01:49:25,650
What would the word intent be?
Are we love Justin? It would,

1890
01:49:25,770 --> 01:49:29,550
our intent would be to make fun and have
a good time and with no hate at all.

1891
01:49:29,730 --> 01:49:32,970
But if we were like sitting
here going, well, you know,

1892
01:49:32,971 --> 01:49:36,920
it's pretty clear in the Bible that the
gay will suffer and we say it today,

1893
01:49:37,060 --> 01:49:39,180
let me say it to him.
And like in an evil way,

1894
01:49:39,300 --> 01:49:41,700
there's nothing wrong with
calling someone gay. Right, right.

1895
01:49:41,850 --> 01:49:43,560
But there's something wrong
with saying those words.

1896
01:49:43,561 --> 01:49:46,950
It's something went wrong with projecting.
Where is it coming from? Of course.

1897
01:49:47,020 --> 01:49:48,370
Do you try?
It's like Patrice O'Neal

1898
01:49:48,370 --> 01:49:52,420
when um, you know, he got on that
MSNBC show or whatever the fuck it was.

1899
01:49:52,600 --> 01:49:57,250
Would that lady lady who was arguing about
a opie and Anthony get in trouble for

1900
01:49:57,251 --> 01:50:01,000
a rape jokes, rape joke
or is it a joke about, no,

1901
01:50:01,030 --> 01:50:04,870
you know what it was was that homeless
guy got on the show and the homeless guy

1902
01:50:04,910 --> 01:50:08,800
w started talking about Condoleezza Rice
and he was doing like saying he would

1903
01:50:08,801 --> 01:50:13,801
rape her and then they got suspended and
what Patrice O'Neal was trying to say

1904
01:50:14,141 --> 01:50:17,890
was that when someone is
trying to be funny like that,

1905
01:50:17,900 --> 01:50:19,720
it's all coming from the same place.

1906
01:50:19,721 --> 01:50:21,460
It's all coming from a
place of trying to be funny.

1907
01:50:21,850 --> 01:50:25,180
If it's coming from a place where you're
trying to hurt someone's feelings or

1908
01:50:25,181 --> 01:50:28,750
you are discriminating or you are
being evil, that's a different thing.

1909
01:50:28,780 --> 01:50:31,960
It's not the label.
It's the intent behind it.

1910
01:50:32,110 --> 01:50:36,180
And we get all tied up in the words
like they were trying to stop bossy for

1911
01:50:36,200 --> 01:50:38,440
awhile. Were you aware of that? Yeah,

1912
01:50:38,441 --> 01:50:41,590
they were trying to say that bossy
is like the new cont, you know,

1913
01:50:41,591 --> 01:50:43,150
like calling someone bossy is like

1914
01:50:43,420 --> 01:50:48,060
they're doing that with,
uh, he's a what's a ghetto?

1915
01:50:48,061 --> 01:50:53,061
But what is the word that like these NFL
players we're trying to say gangster or

1916
01:50:53,341 --> 01:50:54,360
get oh yeah,

1917
01:50:54,361 --> 01:50:58,770
ghetto is the new n word ghetto when
he's acting really ghetto like a,

1918
01:50:58,771 --> 01:51:03,390
this one guy, uh, what's
the, what's Richard Sherman?

1919
01:51:04,290 --> 01:51:06,630
People really flipped out
on him because he was like,

1920
01:51:06,631 --> 01:51:09,600
went off on this football player
in the middle of this, uh,

1921
01:51:09,601 --> 01:51:13,380
interview after game and he's like, oh,
he's all ghetto. He's acting all ghetto.

1922
01:51:13,590 --> 01:51:17,130
And they were trying to say that's
the new way of saying the n word. Oh,

1923
01:51:17,131 --> 01:51:20,760
that's hilarious. Yeah. And it's just
an, he just becomes something new every,

1924
01:51:20,940 --> 01:51:24,600
you know, everybody wants to get offended
by other words and it's just like,

1925
01:51:24,780 --> 01:51:26,340
listen to the n word and the f word.

1926
01:51:26,460 --> 01:51:28,890
There's definitely history behind
that when you're asked for it.

1927
01:51:28,891 --> 01:51:32,200
Compared to when you're talking
about gay guys, right? There's,

1928
01:51:32,220 --> 01:51:36,720
there's a history of oppression out
there that comes with that work.

1929
01:51:37,080 --> 01:51:41,280
Whereas some every group wants get
their own word, but what about faggotry?

1930
01:51:41,940 --> 01:51:45,120
I love that word. I can
really say why. Okay, listen,

1931
01:51:45,150 --> 01:51:48,480
you don't like the word faggot. I totally
understand that you couldn't eat fat.

1932
01:51:48,630 --> 01:51:52,620
It's the same thing. I mean, listen, I say
everybody can say whatever they want to.

1933
01:51:53,220 --> 01:51:56,430
Either you like it or you don't and
we move on. If you don't like it,

1934
01:51:56,730 --> 01:52:00,030
you don't like it. Don't watch
the comedy. Don't watch the show.

1935
01:52:00,150 --> 01:52:02,130
Don't buy the product.
Move the fuck on.

1936
01:52:02,140 --> 01:52:04,720
There's two different things that are
problem here. Two very different things.

1937
01:52:04,750 --> 01:52:09,310
There's one, there's the, the thing
is people saying actual slurs,

1938
01:52:09,430 --> 01:52:14,410
having mean intent and being, you know,
a an evil person with evil intent.

1939
01:52:14,650 --> 01:52:19,650
Then there's also another thing going on
where people just going after words and

1940
01:52:19,661 --> 01:52:23,170
the use of words and trying to limit
the use of words and try to limit the

1941
01:52:23,171 --> 01:52:24,340
language that we use,

1942
01:52:24,580 --> 01:52:29,530
not the intent and not the thought
behind the words, not the, the,

1943
01:52:29,531 --> 01:52:31,720
the philosophy or the
way of looking at life,

1944
01:52:31,721 --> 01:52:35,260
which I think for most of us is constantly
evolving and changing from the time

1945
01:52:35,261 --> 01:52:38,830
we're younger to the time we're older.
We learned life lessons along the way.

1946
01:52:38,831 --> 01:52:41,200
We have fought cops. We, we make mistakes.

1947
01:52:41,201 --> 01:52:42,970
We'd say things we wish
we could take back.

1948
01:52:42,971 --> 01:52:46,190
We say things all the time and
then we see things that we,

1949
01:52:46,190 --> 01:52:50,690
you know, we realize her. Cool. Well
when you had to know six together,

1950
01:52:50,691 --> 01:52:52,010
you got a lot of
different things going on.

1951
01:52:52,160 --> 01:52:54,230
It's not just about the words themselves.

1952
01:52:54,440 --> 01:52:58,550
What it's about is people having like
good intent and there's a lot of people

1953
01:52:58,551 --> 01:52:58,941
also,

1954
01:52:58,941 --> 01:53:03,941
I think that they use these words to
inject some serious fucking hate and

1955
01:53:06,891 --> 01:53:09,200
vitriol out into the world.

1956
01:53:09,410 --> 01:53:14,410
They use other people using those words
to be more hateful than the actual use

1957
01:53:15,111 --> 01:53:20,090
of the word itself. You know, the
more angry like fine, you know,

1958
01:53:20,091 --> 01:53:24,290
youtube comments where
people think they're being
social justice warriors going

1959
01:53:24,291 --> 01:53:28,350
after someone you know who might
have a used an incorrect term. Yeah.

1960
01:53:28,490 --> 01:53:32,660
Or going after someone who says said
as disparaging thing about transgender

1961
01:53:32,661 --> 01:53:34,040
people or whatever the fuck it is,

1962
01:53:34,270 --> 01:53:39,270
and you're just going to find fucking
anger and hate coming from people that are

1963
01:53:39,801 --> 01:53:44,801
supposedly progressive on a scale that
you rarely see even coming from people

1964
01:53:45,651 --> 01:53:46,730
that are conservative.

1965
01:53:46,730 --> 01:53:50,960
What I hate about the political correct
movement is that how much fine print

1966
01:53:50,961 --> 01:53:54,020
comes with that word,
meaning like they should,

1967
01:53:54,170 --> 01:53:59,170
they totally accept it and almost in their
brains convinced themselves that this

1968
01:54:00,111 --> 01:54:04,850
person who they approve of uses the word
is actually use that word to make fun

1969
01:54:04,851 --> 01:54:08,800
of those who used the word is negative.
They actually convinced themselves of it.

1970
01:54:08,870 --> 01:54:12,520
There's so much fun about the coal Baer
report them. Well, not even though that,

1971
01:54:13,670 --> 01:54:17,600
yeah, that girl drives me fucking
nuts. If you don't know that story,

1972
01:54:17,601 --> 01:54:21,560
it's a genius story. Cole Bear.
Um, [inaudible] smart. Yeah.

1973
01:54:21,561 --> 01:54:26,160
Well this cancel cold bear was
this thing that started, uh,

1974
01:54:26,220 --> 01:54:26,660
you know,

1975
01:54:26,660 --> 01:54:31,660
trending online because they thought
that Steven Colbert put out a,

1976
01:54:32,060 --> 01:54:36,140
a racist joke, like pull, pull the
video. Probably pull us off of Youtube,

1977
01:54:36,141 --> 01:54:40,970
but I think it's fair use. Um, we can
just do that. Our article about it. Yeah.

1978
01:54:40,971 --> 01:54:45,260
But the two e two is her neighbor
spark suey park and you know, she's,

1979
01:54:46,520 --> 01:54:49,940
she uses a lot of big words and she
uses a lot of progressive lingo.

1980
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:53,510
Well she was interviewed by us,
somebody on huffing, but let's explain.

1981
01:54:53,540 --> 01:54:54,890
It's explained that the thing,

1982
01:54:55,160 --> 01:55:00,160
the punchline was I'm willing to show
the Asian community I care by introducing

1983
01:55:00,651 --> 01:55:05,651
the Ching Chong Ding Dong Foundation for
sensitivity to orientals or whatever.

1984
01:55:06,680 --> 01:55:11,680
And it was meant to be a satirical analog
to the Washington Redskins original

1985
01:55:13,460 --> 01:55:17,970
Americans Foundation, which is
hilarious. Yeah. I mean, it's funny.

1986
01:55:17,971 --> 01:55:20,590
It's so funny when you
hear it coming from Kobe.

1987
01:55:20,600 --> 01:55:23,000
He's making fun of their callous,

1988
01:55:23,030 --> 01:55:27,980
how safe they are that the people who want
to keep the name red skins. So people,

1989
01:55:27,981 --> 01:55:30,470
some people only saw one part of it.

1990
01:55:30,471 --> 01:55:33,410
And I think it was a tweet
that was a was put out.

1991
01:55:33,560 --> 01:55:36,370
So cancel cold bear,
um,

1992
01:55:36,450 --> 01:55:38,570
to comedy central actually
put out the tweet,

1993
01:55:39,020 --> 01:55:43,900
the hashtag cancel cold bear became one
of Twitter's twinning trending topics

1994
01:55:45,210 --> 01:55:50,100
across the United States.
And it was because this one chick,

1995
01:55:50,280 --> 01:55:53,520
but it's not just her because
whether she was wrong,

1996
01:55:53,521 --> 01:55:58,521
I mean she might have like saw that and
overreacted and didn't understand what

1997
01:55:58,681 --> 01:56:02,520
was going on. That tire didn't see
the whole thing, just saw part of it,

1998
01:56:02,550 --> 01:56:07,110
started it off and then boom, she was
caught up in this wave of interaction.

1999
01:56:07,140 --> 01:56:10,260
Well I would say I would disagree with
that statement that she was caught up in

2000
01:56:10,261 --> 01:56:14,940
it because she would keep doing
interviews about, well after, you know,

2001
01:56:15,120 --> 01:56:18,810
like a week or so after people are like,
you understand it's satire.

2002
01:56:18,960 --> 01:56:21,210
And then the guy interview
on this hub team posting,

2003
01:56:21,211 --> 01:56:25,350
which was really funny and she's like,
I know it's sad. And she gives the,

2004
01:56:25,530 --> 01:56:27,480
the literal definition of satire,

2005
01:56:27,481 --> 01:56:32,260
meaning that she basically read what the
definition was. She didn't get the joke,

2006
01:56:32,310 --> 01:56:34,680
well, here's where it gets
even better by lunchtime.

2007
01:56:35,120 --> 01:56:40,120
Deadspin published a post by two Korean
American writers with the tongue and

2008
01:56:40,171 --> 01:56:43,700
cheek headline Guccis
don't get redskin joke.

2009
01:56:48,390 --> 01:56:53,390
So fellow Asian Americans were attacking
her and cancel co bear became a joke

2010
01:56:56,401 --> 01:56:59,130
more than anything.
And then not only did it not get canceled,

2011
01:56:59,160 --> 01:57:03,150
well he got the goddamn tonight show
or the late show with David Letterman.

2012
01:57:03,151 --> 01:57:07,230
He's the new lunch almost makes me wonder
if the whole thing was fake. I mean,

2013
01:57:07,231 --> 01:57:11,340
my hope opinion is that I'm
starting to see like these things,

2014
01:57:11,670 --> 01:57:16,670
these internet outrageous over statements
being made by comedians and it almost

2015
01:57:17,011 --> 01:57:21,690
gets to the point where I sometimes I
wonder if they're just fake outrage.

2016
01:57:21,810 --> 01:57:26,700
Just the drum up publicity behind this.
What's being said?

2017
01:57:26,701 --> 01:57:29,280
No, it's people realize
that they can get attention.

2018
01:57:29,370 --> 01:57:30,720
That's exactly what's going on.

2019
01:57:30,750 --> 01:57:34,320
They would realize they can get attention
or they get attention by pretending to

2020
01:57:34,321 --> 01:57:35,490
be upset at something.

2021
01:57:35,780 --> 01:57:40,650
Or what if the people who said the
statement people behind them drum up fake

2022
01:57:40,651 --> 01:57:45,090
outrage. Put out this,
pull up this outrage.

2023
01:57:45,270 --> 01:57:50,270
P O u t outright cash rage a
of Suey Park as co bear lands,

2024
01:57:51,511 --> 01:57:56,070
the late show. There's this guy who
does, is a online commentary, uh,

2025
01:57:56,220 --> 01:57:59,430
picking apart everything from this,

2026
01:57:59,820 --> 01:58:04,320
this controversy to feminism
to everything. I mean he's,

2027
01:58:04,590 --> 01:58:08,660
he's pretty hilarious.
So we palm council coal there,

2028
01:58:08,710 --> 01:58:11,790
his name is that under
phones in Time magazine,

2029
01:58:12,230 --> 01:58:17,230
Corose promotion of more white male
celebrities prove is it the entertainment

2030
01:58:18,421 --> 01:58:22,770
industry has perfected the
development of white cis,

2031
01:58:22,950 --> 01:58:27,950
straight male characters
and the marginalization of
other voices except one of

2032
01:58:28,441 --> 01:58:29,580
those others.

2033
01:58:29,670 --> 01:58:34,290
A bolt in only to eat in
the punchline of a joke.

2034
01:58:39,810 --> 01:58:42,370
This is a,
they're showing people

2035
01:58:42,370 --> 01:58:43,900
of color being bad ass

2036
01:58:46,080 --> 01:58:46,913
and women.

2037
01:58:47,220 --> 01:58:52,220
This is all the voices except one of
those others are boarding only to eat in

2038
01:58:53,221 --> 01:58:56,490
the CIC.
Punchline joke is complete.

2039
01:58:57,160 --> 01:59:00,240
This is aggression.
We do not have to accept,

2040
01:59:00,630 --> 01:59:05,490
we will protect this until
it ends of this one to seven,

2041
01:59:05,570 --> 01:59:07,050
just immediately.

2042
01:59:07,260 --> 01:59:11,220
Young Asian American women with
little institutional power.

2043
01:59:11,280 --> 01:59:12,750
I'm not supposed to be loud.

2044
01:59:13,020 --> 01:59:17,540
Our voices are not expected to be
ready on believable. Oh, raised.

2045
01:59:18,030 --> 01:59:20,970
They're not meant to travel.
Actually silly.

2046
01:59:21,210 --> 01:59:25,680
If you all lucky they weren't following
that. There's the old saying goes,

2047
01:59:26,170 --> 01:59:31,170
it's better to remain silent and before
to fall the top open one's mouth and

2048
01:59:31,891 --> 01:59:33,990
remove all doubt

2049
01:59:34,120 --> 01:59:39,120
and how genocide and slavery in oriental
have them all work together to uphold

2050
01:59:39,611 --> 01:59:44,290
white supremacy. Right. Really kind of
the way that I understand as my work,

2051
01:59:44,291 --> 01:59:45,430
which is why a lot of my work,

2052
01:59:45,440 --> 01:59:48,910
anything essentially with these
mainstream Asian American activist groups,

2053
01:59:49,530 --> 01:59:53,790
because the simple truth is the young
people generally don't hold institutional

2054
01:59:53,791 --> 01:59:57,270
power because they lack
general experience.

2055
01:59:57,271 --> 01:59:58,800
They'd like life experience.

2056
01:59:59,010 --> 02:00:02,880
Now I know you left home to go
to university for a year or two.

2057
02:00:03,730 --> 02:00:04,660
My mom just came home.

2058
02:00:05,490 --> 02:00:10,130
Okay, maybe you went to university for
a year or two and now you think you know

2059
02:00:10,190 --> 02:00:14,200
everything about the world
president suing you park.

2060
02:00:14,240 --> 02:00:19,240
They all shrunk as you with your 23
year old wisdom set about solving of the

2061
02:00:20,241 --> 02:00:23,270
world's problems and
many will have chuckle,

2062
02:00:23,271 --> 02:00:25,360
a quiet chuckle of mirth.

2063
02:00:25,361 --> 02:00:29,240
And then I sold as you got
whole lot on your own Hubris,

2064
02:00:29,420 --> 02:00:33,160
only about a week or so after your
campaign though, cancel Colbert.

2065
02:00:33,440 --> 02:00:38,440
It turns out the coal bat was indeed
couldn't cancel and instead he's now going

2066
02:00:38,831 --> 02:00:43,430
to take over the reins from David
Letterman on the eminently prestigious

2067
02:00:43,550 --> 02:00:45,470
leacher.
Oh this seems to trigger,

2068
02:00:45,471 --> 02:00:49,970
these tears are range from you
in your latest article. It's not,

2069
02:00:49,971 --> 02:00:54,971
oh you were till we say it's all the
is a taste of unfashionable sorrow.

2070
02:00:56,601 --> 02:00:57,021
They are.

2071
02:00:57,021 --> 02:01:02,021
So the white man as you frequently refer
to him has now become the beloved white

2072
02:01:02,571 --> 02:01:03,440
one.
Yeah.

2073
02:01:03,470 --> 02:01:08,240
Because being white must mean that
the white man was always reasonable,

2074
02:01:08,300 --> 02:01:10,940
always pure,
always deliberate,

2075
02:01:11,030 --> 02:01:14,330
always complex and always innocent.

2076
02:01:14,570 --> 02:01:19,570
So he continues the recent which the
game by correcting us dismissing.

2077
02:01:20,081 --> 02:01:20,490
Yes.

2078
02:01:20,490 --> 02:01:23,940
No, this is kind of unfair. And
this is like a part of the Internet.

2079
02:01:24,480 --> 02:01:25,890
You know that a young person.

2080
02:01:25,891 --> 02:01:30,090
Cause if I was 23 and you ask my
opinions on virtually anything,

2081
02:01:30,120 --> 02:01:32,460
you would get something
half as intelligent as that.

2082
02:01:32,940 --> 02:01:35,220
We're all idiots at 23 years old.
Well No,

2083
02:01:35,221 --> 02:01:39,970
just a bit unfair about just
the nature of the Internet that

2084
02:01:40,010 --> 02:01:42,200
someone can just,
I agree man.

2085
02:01:42,201 --> 02:01:45,590
But I just think there's something in
this country we're like, and listen,

2086
02:01:45,591 --> 02:01:50,330
racism does exist.
100% save it for that real rate.

2087
02:01:50,360 --> 02:01:54,980
This fake out. This girl wants, this
girl wants credit for oppression.

2088
02:01:54,981 --> 02:01:58,330
She never went through. Well, she's got
a tension. That's what's going on her.

2089
02:01:58,331 --> 02:02:01,700
Her Butler, her like her, her brothers
are like all doctors and lawyers.

2090
02:02:01,730 --> 02:02:05,570
I mean like she's, I mean I
do joke about her, you know,

2091
02:02:05,571 --> 02:02:10,571
it's like she's born in like 1991 like
talk about the dark years of 98 we'll

2092
02:02:11,660 --> 02:02:16,490
Usui like what did you go through in
1988 the oppression that you had to go

2093
02:02:16,491 --> 02:02:19,880
through, like they didn't let you wear
your hello kitty backpack to school.

2094
02:02:19,881 --> 02:02:23,630
Like that's racist. No, it's not. Ranking
them on Asians were in hello kitty is,

2095
02:02:24,470 --> 02:02:28,580
I'll totally okay. Call me racist them
right. Shuts my points at least racial.

2096
02:02:28,640 --> 02:02:32,390
That's my point. What are you going
through? I don't think you have a point.

2097
02:02:32,391 --> 02:02:34,100
I'm going to be honest with you.
I do have a point.

2098
02:02:34,400 --> 02:02:38,150
What was 98 that's the year where you
kind of come into consciousness like point

2099
02:02:38,151 --> 02:02:40,730
is there,
was it just the thought of that?

2100
02:02:40,790 --> 02:02:44,180
She's trying to equate what she's
gone through with like what,

2101
02:02:44,540 --> 02:02:46,370
but I don't think she is.
You know what she is?

2102
02:02:46,430 --> 02:02:49,760
She's getting attention and then she's
running with it and I think you know,

2103
02:02:49,940 --> 02:02:53,660
as much as she might have thought she's
thought this stuff out, what's going on?

2104
02:02:53,661 --> 02:02:57,140
Is she looking at a white belt in life?
She's a white belt.

2105
02:02:57,350 --> 02:03:01,940
She's a young person who's sort of, you
know, maybe she's smart, maybe she's not.

2106
02:03:01,970 --> 02:03:04,640
I don't know. Maybe she's educated.
Maybe she's not. I don't really know.

2107
02:03:04,641 --> 02:03:08,090
It's hard to tell from this because
what you have is a bright spotlight on a

2108
02:03:08,091 --> 02:03:12,290
person who probably shouldn't have had
it on them. Yup. Made a big mistake,

2109
02:03:12,770 --> 02:03:16,220
hit a chord.
That chord is the racism cord and hit it,

2110
02:03:16,280 --> 02:03:20,710
hit it accidentally because
didn't understand the
satire of have a joke and it

2111
02:03:20,711 --> 02:03:24,080
didn't understand the context of a tweet
that it was a part of a much larger

2112
02:03:24,081 --> 02:03:25,280
piece.
And,

2113
02:03:25,320 --> 02:03:28,880
and taking that out of context and
running with it connected to a system.

2114
02:03:29,120 --> 02:03:30,590
And once she's a part of that system,

2115
02:03:30,680 --> 02:03:33,260
once she starts being
interviewed and you know,

2116
02:03:33,261 --> 02:03:36,560
people were calling her a fucking
idiot on Fox News. Like I said,

2117
02:03:36,590 --> 02:03:39,540
I think it was Fox News where
someone called her stupid, like he,

2118
02:03:39,590 --> 02:03:42,920
the guy actually called her stupid.
Like I said, you're, you're,

2119
02:03:42,921 --> 02:03:45,890
what you're saying is so
stupid that I can't even,

2120
02:03:46,320 --> 02:03:50,000
whatever the fuck the guy's statement was.
The point was he called her stupid.

2121
02:03:50,360 --> 02:03:55,360
Like that's when you gotta
be pretty fucking bad at
relaying a point on the news

2122
02:03:56,001 --> 02:03:59,570
for someone to call you stupid.
Well, I, I just, I mean,

2123
02:03:59,571 --> 02:04:04,270
I understand that to have 23 it's just,
she's a black belt. She's white belt.

2124
02:04:04,300 --> 02:04:07,180
He's cute though. Yeah. That's my
whole thing. Who's been meaning?

2125
02:04:07,520 --> 02:04:11,630
Who has been more oppressive
to hot young Asian girls?

2126
02:04:12,500 --> 02:04:16,190
Why old white men or like they're
Asian parents. A young kid.

2127
02:04:16,760 --> 02:04:21,140
She's young kid, you know, she's 23 years
old. Yeah. She so she was called stupid.

2128
02:04:21,650 --> 02:04:24,440
Um,
by uh,

2129
02:04:24,590 --> 02:04:28,700
Josh Huffington post lives.
Josh Zaps.

2130
02:04:28,760 --> 02:04:32,720
That was a funny interview in a heated
debate. Yeah. It's kind of funny,

2131
02:04:32,780 --> 02:04:36,140
by the way. She's doing the interview
on that one in the background.

2132
02:04:36,170 --> 02:04:38,100
She has stuffed animals on her bed.

2133
02:04:40,040 --> 02:04:43,970
Meanwhile, she wrote after that in case
anyone thought I was censoring Cole Bear,

2134
02:04:43,971 --> 02:04:48,971
please know that I was just talked down
to muted and silenced by Josh Zips and

2135
02:04:49,011 --> 02:04:50,270
Huffington Post live.

2136
02:04:51,500 --> 02:04:54,530
And then Josh Zap tweets to her,
uh,

2137
02:04:54,531 --> 02:04:57,290
the righteousness of
professional umbrage takers.

2138
02:04:57,530 --> 02:04:59,360
Suey Park wasn't muted or silence.

2139
02:04:59,361 --> 02:05:03,170
I invited her to explain herself
and she declined. That's funny.

2140
02:05:03,500 --> 02:05:06,680
She pulled that whole thing like you
can't say that because you're a white guy

2141
02:05:06,681 --> 02:05:08,550
thing,
which is a classic like,

2142
02:05:08,960 --> 02:05:13,010
well that's a new thing. The
new thing. Chicago peeps.

2143
02:05:13,011 --> 02:05:16,900
I'm going to be doing a comedy show
on June 26th. Suey park rights away.

2144
02:05:17,070 --> 02:05:21,760
Show off the cackle. Oh my God.
That's not real. That's real. Yeah.

2145
02:05:22,120 --> 02:05:25,820
Oh, she's now getting into stand up
comedy, which is the store. I like.

2146
02:05:26,130 --> 02:05:28,760
Jamie Kelsey is going to coach her.
It's going to work out well.

2147
02:05:29,550 --> 02:05:33,410
We'll welcome you with open dicks.
Don't open your Dick Up.

2148
02:05:33,950 --> 02:05:38,000
Things will fall out of there
like hey is this is crazy.

2149
02:05:38,250 --> 02:05:41,420
She's so the guy said to her, he
said, it's just a stupid opinion.

2150
02:05:42,320 --> 02:05:46,670
She argued that satire is
supposed to punch up. Oh okay.

2151
02:05:46,671 --> 02:05:50,930
It's that thing you shouldn't,
you shouldn't say anything.
Oh please pull that up.

2152
02:05:51,060 --> 02:05:55,190
Pull that video up. Cause
Suey Park and uh, Josh zips

2153
02:05:55,590 --> 02:05:59,430
basically said that he's pretty much not
allowed to comment on it because he's

2154
02:05:59,431 --> 02:06:01,770
not an Asian man cause he's not Asian

2155
02:06:01,970 --> 02:06:03,020
and pays with white privilege.

2156
02:06:03,470 --> 02:06:05,650
Do you know like privilege
is a thing that there was a,

2157
02:06:05,651 --> 02:06:09,080
a recent article that everybody
critiqued or criticized it.

2158
02:06:09,081 --> 02:06:13,520
Some young kid at Yale wrote about being
told to check his privilege. You know,

2159
02:06:13,670 --> 02:06:17,330
this, this whole thing that's check
your privilege thing. It's nice. Uh,

2160
02:06:17,450 --> 02:06:19,430
let's pause that for a
second there. It's, it's,

2161
02:06:19,431 --> 02:06:23,780
it's a nice thing to want people to be
kind and considerate is a nice thing.

2162
02:06:24,050 --> 02:06:26,780
But when you give them a tool,
like check your privilege,

2163
02:06:26,870 --> 02:06:28,640
whenever it involves anything racial,

2164
02:06:28,790 --> 02:06:32,870
you're going to silence the debate because
now someone is being told essentially

2165
02:06:32,990 --> 02:06:36,890
to shut up because they're white,
which is wait for it.

2166
02:06:37,430 --> 02:06:38,263
Racist.

2167
02:06:38,600 --> 02:06:41,900
So you're not even allowed to have a
point of view if you're the wrong race to

2168
02:06:41,901 --> 02:06:44,600
talk because your privilege,
that racist privilege.

2169
02:06:44,660 --> 02:06:48,170
So there's like a balancing act going on
and the white people are not allowed to

2170
02:06:48,171 --> 02:06:49,280
even debate ideas.

2171
02:06:49,460 --> 02:06:53,240
You're supposed to check your privilege
and shut up and listen to whatever,

2172
02:06:53,270 --> 02:06:56,870
whether it's a woman or an Asian or
whoever it is other than the white man.

2173
02:06:56,970 --> 02:06:59,660
I always feel that like
really young boys like, uh,

2174
02:06:59,840 --> 02:07:03,120
like young white boys have to pay
for the sins of their fathers and the

2175
02:07:03,121 --> 02:07:03,954
grandfathers.

2176
02:07:04,050 --> 02:07:07,530
I live near a high school and I drive
by it all the time and I see groups of

2177
02:07:07,531 --> 02:07:09,630
kids hanging out and
they're all multiracial.

2178
02:07:09,631 --> 02:07:13,530
So the whole experiment that's been done
in this country about making everybody

2179
02:07:13,650 --> 02:07:15,690
integrated has worked to a point.

2180
02:07:15,691 --> 02:07:17,850
There's a lot of integration
in these young kids.

2181
02:07:17,851 --> 02:07:21,630
It's working and it's getting
better and it's got more room to go.

2182
02:07:21,840 --> 02:07:25,750
But I feel like young white boys
sometimes have to pay for the sins of thy

2183
02:07:25,751 --> 02:07:27,210
fathers and their grandfathers.

2184
02:07:27,240 --> 02:07:31,170
There's this whole thing in the Mba
that people get really mad that the last

2185
02:07:31,171 --> 02:07:36,171
couple spots on an NBA team tend to be
given to guys and there are really upset

2186
02:07:37,931 --> 02:07:41,440
because you know, it's like well why
should they be making that for white kids?

2187
02:07:41,440 --> 02:07:44,470
Well it's the same thing that
they're doing in Hollywood where, uh,

2188
02:07:44,471 --> 02:07:48,280
you know where the,
the TV shows have to have multiracial,

2189
02:07:49,090 --> 02:07:50,680
multiracial characters.

2190
02:07:50,830 --> 02:07:54,670
The commercials are multiracial so the
young kids see themselves in there and

2191
02:07:54,671 --> 02:07:57,790
realize they could do that too.
It's about reaching everybody.

2192
02:07:57,880 --> 02:08:02,050
Well as I grew up as a young kid
who wanted to play pro basketball,

2193
02:08:02,080 --> 02:08:04,450
there was a woman, yeah. You know,

2194
02:08:04,570 --> 02:08:09,570
I wanted to play pro basketball and
I wanted to be the first white guy,

2195
02:08:10,240 --> 02:08:15,010
the plan Georgetown's basketball team.
Cause at the time it was all black guys.

2196
02:08:15,220 --> 02:08:18,640
Right. And I always wanted to be on
that cause I want to be the white kids.

2197
02:08:18,641 --> 02:08:22,390
So I can understand to a point why you
have a couple of white guys on the team

2198
02:08:22,510 --> 02:08:24,670
because a lot of kids who are young,

2199
02:08:24,790 --> 02:08:28,870
white kids dream of being plain
dream of playing pro basketball.

2200
02:08:28,990 --> 02:08:31,140
So it's the same thing.
The thoughts of,

2201
02:08:31,430 --> 02:08:34,100
of action for white
people. Tools point. Yeah.

2202
02:08:34,340 --> 02:08:38,630
I think that here's the problem with all
this white guy stuff. Without a doubt,

2203
02:08:38,870 --> 02:08:39,800
white people have it

2204
02:08:41,010 --> 02:08:45,150
Wazier way better way, way, way,
way, way complaining it. Yep.

2205
02:08:45,200 --> 02:08:49,670
All about it makes you look like a
fucking idiot because the idea of white

2206
02:08:49,671 --> 02:08:50,181
privilege,

2207
02:08:50,181 --> 02:08:53,870
the real idea is that white people have
an advantage and they had an advantage

2208
02:08:53,871 --> 02:08:56,750
culturally and how they're treated
by society. I think that's true.

2209
02:08:56,900 --> 02:08:57,890
I think it's 100% true.

2210
02:08:58,310 --> 02:09:01,610
It doesn't mean that you should have to
check your white privilege when you're

2211
02:09:01,611 --> 02:09:04,700
talking about ideas cause he cause
saying something like that to someone.

2212
02:09:05,510 --> 02:09:08,600
You're not saying, hey look,
white people have an advantage.

2213
02:09:08,601 --> 02:09:12,110
But realistically that's all unfair and
we should all be equal and we should all

2214
02:09:12,111 --> 02:09:16,340
be one and just let's just go and talk
about ideas from an even playing field.

2215
02:09:16,341 --> 02:09:17,210
I totally agree.

2216
02:09:17,240 --> 02:09:20,000
But this whole thing of like anybody
having an issue on something,

2217
02:09:20,090 --> 02:09:20,840
but then again,

2218
02:09:20,840 --> 02:09:23,480
imagine if you were going to school and
you are a black guys experienced a lot

2219
02:09:23,481 --> 02:09:27,650
of oppression, some rich white twat
was giving you some dude who just like,

2220
02:09:27,651 --> 02:09:27,891
you know,

2221
02:09:27,891 --> 02:09:31,280
grew up with rich parents on the fucking
Hamptons and he's giving you a hard

2222
02:09:31,281 --> 02:09:34,970
time and he doesn't understand that he
got a fucking easy run. The sperm. Yeah.

2223
02:09:35,150 --> 02:09:38,840
So you would want to say
check your privilege to him.
I checked. I get that too.

2224
02:09:39,320 --> 02:09:42,500
I get it when it's appropriate to
let everyone know, like, look dude,

2225
02:09:42,501 --> 02:09:47,180
you got lucky. You, you, you fucking,
you found five aces. That's what it is.

2226
02:09:47,181 --> 02:09:50,240
You were, you were born on third
base. He didn't hit a triple. Okay,

2227
02:09:50,390 --> 02:09:52,250
you're right there.
I got lucky as fuck.

2228
02:09:52,251 --> 02:09:54,260
And that's a lot of people
and that's annoying to folks.

2229
02:09:54,770 --> 02:09:59,770
But the idea that a white person can't
have an opinion about satire because he's

2230
02:10:00,111 --> 02:10:03,230
white and he doesn't understand what
it's like to be an Asian woman who didn't

2231
02:10:03,231 --> 02:10:07,090
get the joke. Holy Shit, that's
dumb. I agree. But that's the PR.

2232
02:10:07,130 --> 02:10:10,350
The problem is she's 23, she's
23 years old. She's, you know,

2233
02:10:10,460 --> 02:10:15,080
a young person with ideas that maybe
aren't completely formed yet thrust into

2234
02:10:15,081 --> 02:10:17,870
this weird position to defend
something that was a mistake.

2235
02:10:18,110 --> 02:10:20,660
I've always said that, uh, you
know how the Israel, Israel,

2236
02:10:20,661 --> 02:10:21,950
you have to serve in the army.

2237
02:10:21,980 --> 02:10:25,620
I've always felt that people in America
after they graduate high school,

2238
02:10:25,730 --> 02:10:27,920
high school, they should all
have to wait tables at Denny's.

2239
02:10:28,080 --> 02:10:29,280
Dude,
I'll tell you this man,

2240
02:10:29,520 --> 02:10:32,850
people aren't canceling core bear
up and fucking Edmonton. Okay?

2241
02:10:32,880 --> 02:10:34,160
They're beaten seals to keep

2242
02:10:34,160 --> 02:10:37,550
their fire warm. They're fucking,
it's cold as shit up there.

2243
02:10:37,670 --> 02:10:41,360
It's a different world.
If you have this really fucking easy life,

2244
02:10:41,570 --> 02:10:45,620
you start finding shit to bitch about
and you start finding shit when you have

2245
02:10:45,621 --> 02:10:46,670
his Internet connection,

2246
02:10:46,671 --> 02:10:49,160
you have the ability to get a bunch
of other knuckleheads involved.

2247
02:10:49,520 --> 02:10:52,700
You start bitching about shit and you
find that there's a bunch of people that

2248
02:10:52,701 --> 02:10:55,250
it resonates with and then
you're caught up in a wave,

2249
02:10:55,490 --> 02:10:58,370
you caught up in a wave of attention
and you see it all the time.

2250
02:10:58,580 --> 02:11:02,180
A lot of these people that are the
so called social justice warriors,

2251
02:11:02,510 --> 02:11:05,090
they're aggressively asshole ish.
Oh.

2252
02:11:05,091 --> 02:11:08,420
I also think there's a lot of it
that there's a lot of personal.

2253
02:11:08,450 --> 02:11:10,040
They're trying to make a dollar off.

2254
02:11:10,070 --> 02:11:12,960
They're like the Susie chew now she's
going to go out there and you should

2255
02:11:12,961 --> 02:11:16,430
choose. So what park wood over
him is more racism. I'm first,

2256
02:11:16,431 --> 02:11:19,820
it was hello kitty now as soon as you
chew. So she's gonna go out there.

2257
02:11:19,821 --> 02:11:21,830
She going to do stand up.
She's probably going to write a book.

2258
02:11:21,831 --> 02:11:24,260
She's going to be making an appearance.
It's only eight and four.

2259
02:11:24,261 --> 02:11:25,220
Let her make the money.

2260
02:11:25,250 --> 02:11:30,250
But my point is how much of it is pure
B B behind actual wanting change and how

2261
02:11:30,951 --> 02:11:33,800
much is it just to make a buck
off it? Well, I don't know,

2262
02:11:33,801 --> 02:11:36,680
but let's listen to this video because
it's quite fascinating. I liked it.

2263
02:11:37,040 --> 02:11:41,630
This a Joshua's apps video weeding.
Suey Park. No, don't do that asshole.

2264
02:11:41,660 --> 02:11:43,470
What are you doing man?
Don't do that.

2265
02:11:43,471 --> 02:11:46,220
I was going to ask her if she want
to do podcasts. Dude, don't do that.

2266
02:11:46,890 --> 02:11:49,580
Oh God. Uh, cancel Cole Bear.

2267
02:11:49,910 --> 02:11:53,100
That's what some Twitter users are
demanding after the call. Bear rapport.

2268
02:11:53,101 --> 02:11:57,440
Put out an album now deleted
tweet reading. I'm willing
to show Asian community.

2269
02:11:57,441 --> 02:12:01,460
I care by introducing the Ching Chong
Dingdong Foundation for sensitivity to

2270
02:12:01,461 --> 02:12:05,390
orientals or whatever they're set off
a Twitter firestorm late Thursday night

2271
02:12:05,391 --> 02:12:06,500
with people sounding off.

2272
02:12:06,770 --> 02:12:10,070
Hashtag cancel call back cause we
really don't need another white liberal

2273
02:12:10,071 --> 02:12:14,270
celebrity trying to justify racism
using satire that ironically ridiculous

2274
02:12:14,271 --> 02:12:18,170
Asians is not productive for indigenous
or nor any marginalized group.

2275
02:12:18,200 --> 02:12:20,380
White humor blows.
Hashtag cancel call bear.

2276
02:12:20,470 --> 02:12:23,930
Why and the willows via
suey park white people.

2277
02:12:23,931 --> 02:12:27,230
Please keep a hashtag cancel Colby
or trending until there's an apology.

2278
02:12:27,350 --> 02:12:30,800
This is not the burden of people
of color. Fix it. Do something.

2279
02:12:31,280 --> 02:12:33,230
Joining us now is the author
of that very same tweet.

2280
02:12:33,260 --> 02:12:36,530
So we park and also still
with us is huffpost politics
reporter Jason Lincoln's.

2281
02:12:36,531 --> 02:12:39,500
Thanks for being with us. Sui
acquire. Thanks for having me.

2282
02:12:39,920 --> 02:12:43,970
Why cancel Cole Bear?
What did you hope to achieve with that?

2283
02:12:45,700 --> 02:12:48,670
Well, that's a loaded
question. I think it's sad,

2284
02:12:48,671 --> 02:12:52,330
but unfortunately a lot of times our
demands aren't really met unless we have

2285
02:12:52,420 --> 02:12:55,930
really serious asks, are we generating
these larger conversations? Um,

2286
02:12:56,060 --> 02:12:59,680
unfortunately people usually don't listen
to us when we're being reasonable. So,

2287
02:12:59,950 --> 02:13:00,340
um,

2288
02:13:00,340 --> 02:13:03,130
I think it's really to make a statement
that this sort of thing happens weekly,

2289
02:13:03,131 --> 02:13:05,930
that I'm Asian Americans
are always a punchline. Um,

2290
02:13:05,950 --> 02:13:08,740
and so I think we're just trying to
make a point that people will be held

2291
02:13:08,741 --> 02:13:10,270
accountable the next time
they do these studies.

2292
02:13:10,700 --> 02:13:12,100
So just to clarify the context,

2293
02:13:12,101 --> 02:13:15,130
the tweet was related to a segment
that was lampooning Dan Snyder,

2294
02:13:15,131 --> 02:13:19,390
who is the owner of a certain Washington
DC football team that has a racist name.

2295
02:13:19,720 --> 02:13:22,330
It was meant to be, it was
meant to be satire. I mean,

2296
02:13:22,331 --> 02:13:24,640
do you understand the point of
satire that you say something that's

2297
02:13:24,641 --> 02:13:27,610
intentionally absurd in order to ridicule
or not the people who are the target

2298
02:13:27,611 --> 02:13:29,920
of what you're saying, but the pit,
but other people who might say it

2299
02:13:30,780 --> 02:13:32,250
of I understand satire.

2300
02:13:32,260 --> 02:13:33,093
I'm a writer.

2301
02:13:33,670 --> 02:13:36,420
I think that tire caters to the
audience that you're speaking to you.

2302
02:13:36,421 --> 02:13:40,110
So it says something about what the
audience finds humorous or acceptable when

2303
02:13:40,111 --> 02:13:43,770
you're using this sort of
jokes. And I think that Tyra's
supposed to punch up. Um,

2304
02:13:43,790 --> 02:13:46,500
so unfortunately he's not doing that when
he draws a parallel to orientalism to

2305
02:13:46,501 --> 02:13:49,190
make a point about a
native American mascot,

2306
02:13:49,880 --> 02:13:53,990
but isn't his point that there are lots
of stupid racist people who isn't even

2307
02:13:53,991 --> 02:13:56,390
in their attempt to be
conciliatory on race,

2308
02:13:56,391 --> 02:13:58,520
end up putting their foot in
it and saying something dumb.

2309
02:13:59,580 --> 02:14:02,130
I really don't think that we're going
to end racism by joking about it.

2310
02:14:02,160 --> 02:14:05,670
Like I'm glad that the white liberal,
it feel like they are less rates.

2311
02:14:05,671 --> 02:14:08,220
That's because they can joke about
people that are more explicitly racist,

2312
02:14:08,221 --> 02:14:11,830
but that actually does nothing to help
people of color. Why? Why attack us?

2313
02:14:11,940 --> 02:14:13,220
Tickle,
attack on dance,

2314
02:14:13,221 --> 02:14:15,590
not as racism instead of just
attacking dance night as racism.

2315
02:14:16,720 --> 02:14:19,340
Uh, well if you're familiar
with my activism where my work,

2316
02:14:19,341 --> 02:14:22,080
I've been very vocal about
a native American mascot.

2317
02:14:22,081 --> 02:14:25,730
So I went to the University of Illinois
for my undergraduate career and when we

2318
02:14:25,731 --> 02:14:29,150
had [inaudible] and I was incredibly
vocal about it and I had the same sort of

2319
02:14:29,151 --> 02:14:30,230
backlash,
um,

2320
02:14:30,260 --> 02:14:32,810
and that kind of backlash happens no
matter what you're really attacking,

2321
02:14:32,811 --> 02:14:36,650
whether it be, um, you know, the word
oriental being used as a slur, um,

2322
02:14:36,651 --> 02:14:40,190
yellow face jokes against Asian American
people or if I'm really just talking

2323
02:14:40,191 --> 02:14:43,970
about native American mascots and Dan
Snyder, um, I know I helped trend,

2324
02:14:43,971 --> 02:14:47,810
I'm not your mascot. Um, on
Superbowl night. Um, if I, you know,

2325
02:14:47,811 --> 02:14:49,640
the name red skins and not your Tonto.

2326
02:14:49,641 --> 02:14:51,770
And I had the same sort
of backlash though.

2327
02:14:51,771 --> 02:14:55,370
It really isn't fair to
kind of individualize these
things and ask why I'm not

2328
02:14:55,371 --> 02:14:56,900
shifting my behavior.
Because honestly,

2329
02:14:56,901 --> 02:14:59,900
if white liberals cared about
really getting rid of the mascot,

2330
02:14:59,930 --> 02:15:03,050
there's a lot they can do to help organize
or get involved besides caring about

2331
02:15:03,051 --> 02:15:06,490
their joke. So for them, it's not
really about whether or not, um,

2332
02:15:06,860 --> 02:15:09,680
the Redskins exists or
whether or not racism is over.

2333
02:15:09,681 --> 02:15:12,680
It's really about them feeling
like they can't have fun anymore.

2334
02:15:12,681 --> 02:15:15,650
I'm feeling entitled to be able to laugh
at things that aren't really funny.

2335
02:15:15,990 --> 02:15:19,980
Jason, a part of the whole, the whole gag
here is the use of the term orientalism,

2336
02:15:19,981 --> 02:15:24,120
which is such a weird old loaded, like
it's just, it, it's a stupid, stupid,

2337
02:15:24,121 --> 02:15:26,730
a word that the butt to
get upset about that,

2338
02:15:26,731 --> 02:15:29,460
about the use of that word when it's
in a satirical context strikes me as

2339
02:15:29,461 --> 02:15:30,000
misguided.

2340
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:32,940
I want to take a look though at a
tweet which a cold bear rapport has a,

2341
02:15:32,941 --> 02:15:34,110
has tweeted out,
says for the record,

2342
02:15:34,610 --> 02:15:36,650
bear rapport is not the white man.
You know,

2343
02:15:37,410 --> 02:15:39,540
hang on till we all come to you
in just a sec. Uh, for the record,

2344
02:15:39,541 --> 02:15:42,090
cold bear rapport is not controlled
by Stephen Colbert. All his show.

2345
02:15:42,091 --> 02:15:44,970
He is at Steven at home.
Sorry for the confusion. I,

2346
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:47,370
Kobe himself has responded to
some of the criticism on Twitter.

2347
02:15:47,640 --> 02:15:52,620
Hashtag cancel Kobe. I agree. Just saw
at Colby report tweet. I share your rage.

2348
02:15:52,770 --> 02:15:56,520
Who is that though? I'm Steven at home.
Uh, so you were just going to jump in.

2349
02:15:57,840 --> 02:15:59,320
Uh, yeah, I was gonna say that.

2350
02:15:59,321 --> 02:16:01,900
I feel like it's incredibly patronizing
for you to paint these questions this

2351
02:16:01,901 --> 02:16:03,460
way,
especially as a white man.

2352
02:16:03,461 --> 02:16:06,430
I don't expect you to be
able to understand what
people of color are actually

2353
02:16:06,450 --> 02:16:08,520
same with regards to cancel.
Call there

2354
02:16:11,470 --> 02:16:12,730
being a white man doesn't give him,

2355
02:16:12,731 --> 02:16:15,370
it doesn't prevent me from being able to
think and doesn't prevent me from being

2356
02:16:15,371 --> 02:16:18,630
able to have, uh, have thought reason,
perspectives on things I don't,

2357
02:16:18,670 --> 02:16:19,503
I didn't give up.

2358
02:16:19,520 --> 02:16:22,450
I didn't give up my right to be able
to have an intellectual conversation.

2359
02:16:23,120 --> 02:16:24,440
I know,
but oh well.

2360
02:16:24,470 --> 02:16:26,630
White men definitely feel like
they are entitled to talk over me.

2361
02:16:26,631 --> 02:16:30,130
They definitely feel like they're entitled
to kind of minimalize experiences and

2362
02:16:30,131 --> 02:16:33,550
they definitely feel like they are
somehow exempt and so logical compared to

2363
02:16:33,551 --> 02:16:35,440
them women who are painted as a personnel,
right?

2364
02:16:35,670 --> 02:16:38,280
Oh No, no one's minimalizing
your your experiences.

2365
02:16:38,281 --> 02:16:41,370
No one's minimalizing your right to have
an opinion. It's just a stupid opinion.

2366
02:16:41,371 --> 02:16:43,620
I mean it's,
it's a misunderstanding of what,

2367
02:16:46,830 --> 02:16:49,280
yes,
you just called my opinion stupid.

2368
02:16:49,281 --> 02:16:53,030
That's incredibly unproductive and I
don't think I'm going to enact the labor.

2369
02:16:53,031 --> 02:16:56,010
I've had any to explain to you why that's
incredibly offensive and patronizing.

2370
02:16:57,040 --> 02:17:01,550
Explain. I just told you that
when the neck, that Labor, okay.

2371
02:17:01,580 --> 02:17:02,280
Thanks for being with us.

2372
02:17:02,280 --> 02:17:06,660
Sui Looking.

2373
02:17:07,220 --> 02:17:11,420
It's unfair. That's a black belt
versus a white belt. That's what it is.

2374
02:17:11,421 --> 02:17:15,890
I mean even if she had a point, you
know, in some way, shape or form,

2375
02:17:16,160 --> 02:17:21,160
that's sort of wrapped up in
all this fucking craziness.

2376
02:17:21,890 --> 02:17:25,180
Even if she had a point, it's just
what if, what if she's complaining?

2377
02:17:25,181 --> 02:17:27,070
Like to me it's,

2378
02:17:27,071 --> 02:17:32,071
it's so interesting cause some of the
most damaging Asian racial material is

2379
02:17:32,391 --> 02:17:36,530
done by Asian comedians. Like what's
your take on that? Well they do.

2380
02:17:36,531 --> 02:17:39,740
Why do they do it though? They do it
because it works like why they do it.

2381
02:17:39,741 --> 02:17:42,500
They do it to break the
ice like why they got fat,

2382
02:17:42,501 --> 02:17:45,650
guys tell fat jokes so that you can't,
right? Because if you go on stage,

2383
02:17:45,660 --> 02:17:48,830
you're a fat fuck and your entire act
is just about all. She's called me fat.

2384
02:17:48,831 --> 02:17:53,690
Fuck Bro. I said if you know, if you're
a guy and you're, you're a giant guy,

2385
02:17:53,750 --> 02:17:55,880
you better talk about that on stage.
I agree.

2386
02:17:55,910 --> 02:17:58,820
Because if you don't and the audience
is going to fucking pointed out what is

2387
02:17:58,821 --> 02:18:03,440
this. Okay. She talks back
and forth. Oh and best buddies

2388
02:18:05,480 --> 02:18:09,200
course Jamie Kilstein.
Oh my God,

2389
02:18:09,710 --> 02:18:12,650
it's so bastard. Just a show
cause is all a simulation theory.

2390
02:18:13,610 --> 02:18:17,210
I was choking when I say that he would
help her with her comedy. Oh my God.

2391
02:18:17,211 --> 02:18:18,530
It probably helped her with her comedy.

2392
02:18:21,980 --> 02:18:25,400
He means, well I swear to God
he does. I just can't. I just,

2393
02:18:25,401 --> 02:18:30,320
it's like it's great to males. So much
fine print. It's bad to be a guide.

2394
02:18:30,330 --> 02:18:33,470
Don't you know men are men
getting all these women pregnant.

2395
02:18:33,471 --> 02:18:37,760
Doing all the raping, building, all
the roads. Unbelieving are assholes.

2396
02:18:38,660 --> 02:18:42,650
It's a mess. The whole thing
is, gosh, it's, it's especially
in this country where,

2397
02:18:42,651 --> 02:18:46,010
I mean like everything I
know is not perfect, Bam,

2398
02:18:46,011 --> 02:18:49,250
but when you hear what goes on
in other countries by that it's,

2399
02:18:49,320 --> 02:18:51,890
it's just so big that don't buy that.
This is why I don't buy that.

2400
02:18:51,891 --> 02:18:56,480
People always say that, but we know
that it could be better. So yeah,

2401
02:18:56,481 --> 02:18:59,130
it's better than what it is. Another
kind of agree with Dell, it's,

2402
02:18:59,131 --> 02:19:03,320
it's a crazy thing to say with all the
information awareness we have the least

2403
02:19:03,321 --> 02:19:07,030
important thing to concentrate on is
how much better it is here. Right? Yeah.

2404
02:19:07,040 --> 02:19:10,100
About dwelling on like patting ourselves
on the back for making this country

2405
02:19:10,101 --> 02:19:11,300
better than the other.
Not saying that,

2406
02:19:11,420 --> 02:19:13,310
but that's what everybody
does and not saying that,

2407
02:19:13,730 --> 02:19:18,730
but she is sitting there and taking a
joke and just making it into this giant

2408
02:19:18,891 --> 02:19:23,120
global issue or she's trying to do it
when we have a situation in China where

2409
02:19:23,121 --> 02:19:25,130
they chuck girls when they were like,
man,

2410
02:19:25,131 --> 02:19:29,030
I don't expect you to understand
chucking girls China as a white man.

2411
02:19:29,031 --> 02:19:30,870
I think it's incredibly
condescending and patronizing.

2412
02:19:30,910 --> 02:19:33,550
Use the network to we pack.
Can I open?

2413
02:19:37,580 --> 02:19:42,440
I would love to you a man will
do it for laid down in Edmonton.

2414
02:19:42,441 --> 02:19:46,760
By the way, Sam Shipley's new CD
available to believe in yourself.

2415
02:19:46,970 --> 02:19:50,330
Believe in yourself.
You thank you in there and you please Bro.

2416
02:19:50,331 --> 02:19:52,850
The set that you laid down when we
were working together in Edmonton,

2417
02:19:52,851 --> 02:19:55,590
you [inaudible] did,
did it.

2418
02:19:55,600 --> 02:19:58,530
It was a lot of fun and that was
right before you filmed it. Right.

2419
02:19:58,531 --> 02:19:59,470
And we're recording it rather,

2420
02:19:59,540 --> 02:20:03,110
and it was really worked up because
a bunch of people that we came to the

2421
02:20:03,111 --> 02:20:05,570
commissary and said they'd saw me
at your show in Edmonton. Yeah,

2422
02:20:05,571 --> 02:20:07,250
we totally worked out ways.
Yeah,

2423
02:20:07,310 --> 02:20:10,040
we were at the river Cree and then
Sam was there like how long later?

2424
02:20:10,210 --> 02:20:13,160
Like literally the next week.
Perfect. It was awesome. Yeah,

2425
02:20:13,161 --> 02:20:14,330
and then they came down to support.

2426
02:20:14,360 --> 02:20:17,390
That's awesome because that was a fun
set dude. But you were only doing,

2427
02:20:17,570 --> 02:20:20,430
he did a half an hour at my show. How
long has the CD, you have a lobbyist?

2428
02:20:20,500 --> 02:20:22,970
Almost an hour.
So even if they did come to see it,

2429
02:20:22,971 --> 02:20:24,410
they still got a bunch
of shit that they didn't.

2430
02:20:24,510 --> 02:20:28,820
The fucking rob Ford stuff was funny.
Is that on this? That's funny shit man.

2431
02:20:28,940 --> 02:20:32,300
Get it on there before it's old school.
Fucking caught him again since then.

2432
02:20:32,540 --> 02:20:34,760
They caught him again.
He's at the comedy store.

2433
02:20:34,790 --> 02:20:38,510
He showed up with a store and
Brian didn't even pictures of him.

2434
02:20:38,570 --> 02:20:42,240
Did you get pictures of him that no,
I was out of town, but everyone, yeah.

2435
02:20:43,300 --> 02:20:46,430
I'm like, why don't we just open the
bar and see what we can get into?

2436
02:20:46,460 --> 02:20:47,750
If we were back there,

2437
02:20:48,080 --> 02:20:50,600
if that was like during the days when
I was hanging out at the comic store,

2438
02:20:50,601 --> 02:20:53,760
we would have the greatest video of
all time and he talking to rob Ford.

2439
02:20:54,030 --> 02:20:58,070
I would have got him shot. Sweat standings
are bringing shots to open, open,

2440
02:20:58,580 --> 02:21:00,020
open bar,
have fun.

2441
02:21:00,080 --> 02:21:03,890
I wouldn't call Uber in advance knowing
those going to be too drunk to drive.

2442
02:21:03,920 --> 02:21:08,030
I would have just fucking threw my
keys in a in a condom, swallowed them,

2443
02:21:08,330 --> 02:21:12,040
lock my car and just
start hitting it hard. Oh,

2444
02:21:12,050 --> 02:21:17,050
I would love to all the crazy cocaine
running around that place swallowed my

2445
02:21:17,270 --> 02:21:18,860
keys like a fucking drug mule.

2446
02:21:19,270 --> 02:21:22,550
I was so jealous watching everyone's
Twitter feed because if you're in La Jolla

2447
02:21:22,580 --> 02:21:26,680
and I was like, the one time I'm not at
the comedy story. That's hilarious man.

2448
02:21:26,750 --> 02:21:31,010
Have you heard about Drug
Carmichael? Rogan? What?

2449
02:21:31,610 --> 02:21:36,050
This kid named Gerard Carmichael,
the nicest kid. That kid right there,

2450
02:21:36,290 --> 02:21:41,290
he just shut his first standup special
was a one hour HBO special directed by

2451
02:21:44,061 --> 02:21:47,090
Spike Lee in the o are at
the comedy store. Yeah.

2452
02:21:47,091 --> 02:21:52,010
You know who told me that was the nicest
kid in Edwards told me he was doing

2453
02:21:52,011 --> 02:21:55,550
that there. Dude could not,
I mean really dude. Yeah.

2454
02:21:55,580 --> 02:21:58,970
Ian Actually came over to the
ice house after we had done it.

2455
02:21:58,971 --> 02:22:02,410
He did it like on a Wednesday
night, right? Yeah, I did
on some crazy nightmare.

2456
02:22:02,450 --> 02:22:05,120
Yeah. It was a Wednesday night cause Ian
went to see and then he came down to the

2457
02:22:05,300 --> 02:22:09,320
comedy store afterwards. Such a
nice kid, but that's legendary dude.

2458
02:22:09,410 --> 02:22:14,190
That is legendary. Ever stand
up on television is a one hours.

2459
02:22:14,420 --> 02:22:19,100
It's pretty bad in the most, the most
sacred of rooms. I mean the ors crazy.

2460
02:22:19,101 --> 02:22:23,030
How many specials have ever been done
in the or? I think that's the first,

2461
02:22:23,900 --> 02:22:26,760
well maybe they're smart and
opening that place up to specials.

2462
02:22:26,820 --> 02:22:30,730
They're getting internet. Oh that's right.
Oh well I don't want them to show soon.

2463
02:22:31,470 --> 02:22:33,990
I going to see what's there. We're
getting nutty. Why are they doing that?

2464
02:22:34,280 --> 02:22:38,300
That's the dangerous dolch.
I don't want them showing our live sets.

2465
02:22:38,301 --> 02:22:40,560
You've got to work on stuff.
That's why there was a,

2466
02:22:40,561 --> 02:22:43,200
with the laugh factory was doing that
for awhile. There's a comedy club,

2467
02:22:43,340 --> 02:22:45,360
and I don't want to say the
name, but they were, they were,

2468
02:22:45,630 --> 02:22:49,140
if you signed the agreement, the play
there, they record your set. And I'm like,

2469
02:22:49,141 --> 02:22:52,890
I don't want your record my set because
I'm coming here to work out material

2470
02:22:54,360 --> 02:22:58,890
that's fucked. That's fucked.
Yeah. That's not good. You know,

2471
02:22:59,220 --> 02:23:01,220
I think people that run clubs,
you know,

2472
02:23:01,230 --> 02:23:02,970
they're just trying to
get asses in the seats,

2473
02:23:02,971 --> 02:23:05,910
try to get people excited about the
colony. And if you don't do the,

2474
02:23:05,911 --> 02:23:07,590
the process of creating it yourself,

2475
02:23:07,591 --> 02:23:10,350
you don't know how vital that is
unless you're really paying attention.

2476
02:23:10,620 --> 02:23:14,010
A lot of club owners do know, but some
of them just think, hey, you know,

2477
02:23:14,011 --> 02:23:17,010
we're getting people to look, or you
got 100,000 views on youtube channel,

2478
02:23:18,430 --> 02:23:21,450
you know, Sham, triple. He just
worked right. New materials that hard.

2479
02:23:21,451 --> 02:23:23,040
We're giving you have a
great place to perform.

2480
02:23:23,140 --> 02:23:26,850
She should be happy to perform here.
But that was the thing about some clubs,

2481
02:23:26,851 --> 02:23:29,760
especially like the Hollywood
clubs where they have this odd,

2482
02:23:30,270 --> 02:23:33,780
this attitude that like working
there was supposed to be prestigious,

2483
02:23:33,781 --> 02:23:37,240
that the club itself was like the star.
Like um,

2484
02:23:37,290 --> 02:23:40,020
you're a box with a
microphone. Yes. Right.

2485
02:23:40,050 --> 02:23:43,230
It's the comedians that have
performed here that are legendary.

2486
02:23:43,440 --> 02:23:46,890
It's not this box with a microphone
cause they could've gone next door to the

2487
02:23:46,891 --> 02:23:50,970
fucking Hyatt. They could have built a box
there. I'll do, we'd have to do is say,

2488
02:23:50,971 --> 02:23:52,860
Hey, you know what? I'm not
performing here anymore.

2489
02:23:53,160 --> 02:23:55,950
I'm going to build a box next door
at the Hyatt. Let's pack that bitch.

2490
02:23:56,190 --> 02:23:58,470
And you know, if Kennis he never
wanted to do that or let them in.

2491
02:23:58,470 --> 02:24:01,170
Everyone or any of those guys
that made the comedy store famous,

2492
02:24:01,171 --> 02:24:04,830
ever wanted to perform next door,
they could have done that.

2493
02:24:04,890 --> 02:24:08,780
I thought after a wild Sam Kennison
started just doing rock clubs, he didn't.

2494
02:24:08,840 --> 02:24:13,820
I'm like sunset. Well he did a lot of
that. But you know, he's the best example.

2495
02:24:13,850 --> 02:24:17,460
I've talked about it before about a guy
who was really good and became a really

2496
02:24:17,461 --> 02:24:22,080
bad in a short period of time from
making it, just making it just the, the,

2497
02:24:22,140 --> 02:24:22,840
the,

2498
02:24:22,840 --> 02:24:27,840
the fucking overwhelming pressure of being
famous and being huge at one point in

2499
02:24:29,131 --> 02:24:33,180
time. Fuck, I just fell apart. I shrugged.
She think had something to do with it.

2500
02:24:33,181 --> 02:24:37,200
Fuck yeah. Dude. Boobs and it drugging
it. His brother talked about in his book.

2501
02:24:37,350 --> 02:24:41,160
Really fascinating brother Sam. Have
you read it? Yeah, yeah. It's good man.

2502
02:24:41,280 --> 02:24:44,070
It's really good. Get it. It's
great. But I'll read it out of print,

2503
02:24:44,071 --> 02:24:48,990
but you can get it off and go to your
house and steal it. Don't do, don't steal.

2504
02:24:48,991 --> 02:24:53,880
Sam, what kind of a message that I say
send to the, especially the Asians steel.

2505
02:24:53,910 --> 02:24:54,980
Do you see that?
A video?

2506
02:24:55,020 --> 02:24:58,390
Elisabeth Hasselbeck was talking to
some guy who was a former NFL players.

2507
02:24:58,410 --> 02:25:02,910
Now a lawyer, really smart guy. And they
were talking about marijuana and uh,

2508
02:25:02,911 --> 02:25:05,580
you know, she was, it was on Fox
News and Elisabeth Hasselbeck,

2509
02:25:05,690 --> 02:25:08,120
they're really conservative,
hot, blonde chick. The view,

2510
02:25:08,430 --> 02:25:11,650
she found her rightly place in the
universe. She must be so excited.

2511
02:25:11,651 --> 02:25:15,030
She's one of the hot blondes on Fox News.
She was like a reality show.

2512
02:25:15,031 --> 02:25:17,340
What was it like as survivors?
Yes,

2513
02:25:17,341 --> 02:25:20,580
it was on survivor and then she got
on the view and then a pop popup.

2514
02:25:20,581 --> 02:25:24,580
How and now she's a,
now she's Fox News where she belonged.

2515
02:25:24,580 --> 02:25:28,180
She is happy to be there
just spreading sate and seed.

2516
02:25:28,510 --> 02:25:33,310
And she was talking to this guy who's
a former football player and they were

2517
02:25:33,311 --> 02:25:36,110
talking about weed and the guy made
an excellent point. You just said,

2518
02:25:36,310 --> 02:25:38,590
isn't it going to send the wrong
message to the children? He was like,

2519
02:25:38,740 --> 02:25:43,570
if the NFL today decided to ban
alcohol use for all of its players,

2520
02:25:43,840 --> 02:25:48,370
it wouldn't affect teen alcohol use
at all. And she was just like earth.

2521
02:25:48,730 --> 02:25:52,400
Yeah, that's her. That's her face. That's
the face that she had. He was like,

2522
02:25:52,940 --> 02:25:55,120
there's worst things to worry about.
We're gonna have to play it. I don't,

2523
02:25:55,121 --> 02:25:59,650
I didn't want to play it. So fucking dumb.
Those conversations are so brutal too.

2524
02:26:00,070 --> 02:26:00,880
When you,
uh,

2525
02:26:00,880 --> 02:26:04,390
when you have long form conversations
like on a podcast and like say all the

2526
02:26:04,391 --> 02:26:05,201
things we were talking about,

2527
02:26:05,201 --> 02:26:09,340
whether it's we're talking about the
cancel called bear thing or racism or

2528
02:26:09,341 --> 02:26:12,640
privilege.
These are like long discussions.

2529
02:26:12,760 --> 02:26:15,160
They're long debates where if you're,

2530
02:26:15,161 --> 02:26:17,980
if you're going to really get to the
heart of something and find out a person's

2531
02:26:17,981 --> 02:26:19,950
real opinions on something you,

2532
02:26:19,980 --> 02:26:23,350
it's a very subtle and nuanced
sort of a thing. There's,

2533
02:26:23,351 --> 02:26:26,470
you need to really be able to
talk for long periods of time.

2534
02:26:26,800 --> 02:26:27,880
There's nothing wrong with that,

2535
02:26:28,450 --> 02:26:32,260
but when you're doing that on
a show like a Fox News show,

2536
02:26:32,440 --> 02:26:33,273
you have three minutes.

2537
02:26:33,490 --> 02:26:36,250
This conversation with this football
player was three and a half minutes long.

2538
02:26:36,370 --> 02:26:39,850
Football player turned lawyer three
and a half minutes and then at the end

2539
02:26:39,851 --> 02:26:42,160
they're like, okay, well thank you
for your time. We appreciate it. Bye.

2540
02:26:42,310 --> 02:26:43,600
We're done covering this subject.

2541
02:26:43,601 --> 02:26:47,560
We're going to discuss a gay
military people and fucking
what about gay marriage?

2542
02:26:47,561 --> 02:26:49,570
And they're wearing
cammo now what do we do?

2543
02:26:49,571 --> 02:26:53,830
We take camelback believable.
It is unbelievable what it's,

2544
02:26:53,860 --> 02:26:57,250
it's that form of entertainment,
that form of communication,

2545
02:26:57,610 --> 02:26:58,660
that form of entertainment.

2546
02:26:58,660 --> 02:27:01,000
Let's call it entertainment cause
that's really what it is. It's,

2547
02:27:01,240 --> 02:27:03,580
it is not just unsuitable.

2548
02:27:03,830 --> 02:27:08,770
It's not adequate for complex
topics. It's not, it's not adequate.

2549
02:27:08,800 --> 02:27:11,950
When you discuss the subject
of marijuana and teenagers,

2550
02:27:11,980 --> 02:27:16,090
if you discussing it like that and
discuss the subject of the NFL,

2551
02:27:16,120 --> 02:27:20,650
telling players that they can't or can
use marijuana and whether or not you

2552
02:27:20,651 --> 02:27:24,220
support that, what you're supporting,
if you support that, they can.

2553
02:27:24,250 --> 02:27:25,660
They can tell players they can't use it.

2554
02:27:25,780 --> 02:27:30,070
You're supporting people having control
over their employees. You're not,

2555
02:27:30,130 --> 02:27:33,430
it's no one, they're gone
from work. Exactly. Exactly.

2556
02:27:33,431 --> 02:27:36,280
You're not even talking about something
that they're like in showing up at work

2557
02:27:36,281 --> 02:27:39,220
drunk. You can't play football drunk
and you probably can't play at high.

2558
02:27:39,370 --> 02:27:43,300
Maybe you can. I think fastball plus
dealers do. They love it. They love it

2559
02:27:45,310 --> 02:27:49,450
of how big the moment is. Do you know
what I'm, they're not really thinking.

2560
02:27:49,450 --> 02:27:53,470
They're more like just in the moment of
playing basketball. Then realizing, oh,

2561
02:27:53,471 --> 02:27:56,170
this might be game seven of this playoff
game. Do you know what I'm saying?

2562
02:27:56,171 --> 02:28:00,460
To a point, you don't like the smoke the
weed that much, but when when you're,

2563
02:28:00,610 --> 02:28:04,480
when you smoke the weed and you do things,
whether it's Jujitsu or playing pool,

2564
02:28:04,510 --> 02:28:09,010
those are the two things I could speak
of. You play better. It's enhancing drug.

2565
02:28:09,060 --> 02:28:13,390
Yeah. You have a more, you
have more sensitivity, you
feel things better. You, you,

2566
02:28:13,391 --> 02:28:17,620
you've, you literally, you're tuned
into like whatever the fuck it is.

2567
02:28:17,621 --> 02:28:22,250
Better tune into distance better. He
tuned into the rotations, have a ball.

2568
02:28:22,400 --> 02:28:25,610
You tuned into the way a person moves.
Like when you do Jujitsu and you're high,

2569
02:28:25,611 --> 02:28:28,090
you can feel things better.
You feel that sounds okay.

2570
02:28:28,670 --> 02:28:32,120
You can feel movement better.
You feel balanced and shifting better.

2571
02:28:32,180 --> 02:28:36,800
I, the only time we ever perform high
is when I go to the underground cafe.

2572
02:28:36,801 --> 02:28:39,440
I'm doing it in June.
Like the Toronto. Yeah,

2573
02:28:39,441 --> 02:28:43,370
the 12th through the 14th and it's like,
I don't have a say in it.

2574
02:28:43,460 --> 02:28:47,300
As soon as I hit the stage,
by the time my foot presses down on that,

2575
02:28:47,330 --> 02:28:50,030
I am gone.
And it's just,

2576
02:28:50,150 --> 02:28:52,640
it's very interesting because once your,
Wayne,

2577
02:28:52,641 --> 02:28:57,260
why you don't have a say in it because
the room is, well basically it's this,

2578
02:28:57,320 --> 02:28:57,740
uh,

2579
02:28:57,740 --> 02:29:02,450
we'd bar that has a comedy club
in it and it's so much fun to do.

2580
02:29:02,690 --> 02:29:05,810
So they have a standup show,
but usually before the standup shows,

2581
02:29:05,811 --> 02:29:08,990
sometimes there's like an improv
troupe or there's an open mic,

2582
02:29:09,380 --> 02:29:13,370
which it can be like two hours long.
So people are a hot box and in there.

2583
02:29:13,550 --> 02:29:16,940
And then everybody smoked weed all
the whole time before the show.

2584
02:29:17,360 --> 02:29:20,810
The stamp show even starts and then the
standup show starts and there's usually

2585
02:29:20,811 --> 02:29:24,440
like two or three people go on before
the headliner and everybody's just

2586
02:29:24,441 --> 02:29:27,860
hotboxing smoking weed, smoking
weed. So when you walk out,

2587
02:29:27,920 --> 02:29:32,920
you're just walking into this just this
room of fucking weed smoke and it looks

2588
02:29:33,531 --> 02:29:38,060
like gorillas in the mist. Like you
just see black objects moving in the,

2589
02:29:38,120 --> 02:29:42,710
in the background under this,
like this cloud of smoke and,

2590
02:29:42,720 --> 02:29:46,160
but by the time my foot hits the stage,
I am gone.

2591
02:29:46,820 --> 02:29:49,460
I can tell you I'm high just
from breathing in a second,

2592
02:29:49,461 --> 02:29:52,220
just breathing in and I've stopped
going. Okay, I'm so high now.

2593
02:29:52,250 --> 02:29:55,220
I just accept it and just start riffing.

2594
02:29:55,250 --> 02:29:58,490
Hinchcliffe had a green out there where
he actually had to take off his shirt

2595
02:29:58,520 --> 02:30:01,570
and it's so unlike him that he had to
go like sit outside on the sidewalk was

2596
02:30:01,580 --> 02:30:05,940
after he was trying to rustle
up some boys that nice gay,

2597
02:30:06,030 --> 02:30:09,490
super twink tweak,
shining super tank,

2598
02:30:09,860 --> 02:30:12,650
put on an extra show.
Sometimes people that want attention,

2599
02:30:12,651 --> 02:30:17,000
they want it all the time,
not just onstage, offstage
as well. I took my shirt off.

2600
02:30:17,001 --> 02:30:17,834
I'm so hot.

2601
02:30:19,230 --> 02:30:22,330
Anger.
Mm.

2602
02:30:22,840 --> 02:30:27,340
So hot outside. Yeah. He's a, he's a,
he's a flirt. That's what he's doing.

2603
02:30:27,341 --> 02:30:30,910
He's not even gay gay flair. He just knows
what he's got. He knows what he's got.

2604
02:30:30,911 --> 02:30:33,600
He's like a hot chick who's married
and she likes to wear short skirts and

2605
02:30:34,020 --> 02:30:37,530
walked past the bar and know
that every guy is like, Ooh God.

2606
02:30:37,540 --> 02:30:40,950
She not even trying to
cheat. She's trying. She just
likes the attention. Yeah.

2607
02:30:40,970 --> 02:30:43,450
Just trying to like likes the head turns.
Get the party started.

2608
02:30:44,090 --> 02:30:46,680
Let's get people excited. Let,
let it, let her, you know,

2609
02:30:46,750 --> 02:30:49,990
let her know she's still rocking it.
Keep on rocking in the free world.

2610
02:30:50,650 --> 02:30:54,820
So we parked suey park. I don't have
anything against that girl. By the way,

2611
02:30:54,821 --> 02:30:58,060
if she ever listens to this much
love to you kid, I'll take her out.

2612
02:30:58,480 --> 02:30:59,410
Brian will take you out.

2613
02:30:59,500 --> 02:31:03,670
I don't think that's a good thing and
will help him cause I don't think that

2614
02:31:03,671 --> 02:31:07,770
helps anybody. But maybe Brian, I
don't even think it helps him. Um,

2615
02:31:07,810 --> 02:31:11,590
it doesn't help anybody, but he's
just saying that if you were into it,

2616
02:31:11,620 --> 02:31:14,500
you know you can hang out
with them. Yeah. I just,

2617
02:31:14,890 --> 02:31:19,060
I don't like anybody who puts restrictions
on comedians and what they can say.

2618
02:31:19,260 --> 02:31:20,070
There's this whole thing with

2619
02:31:20,070 --> 02:31:23,760
Leslie Jones too.
She got Leslie Jones,

2620
02:31:23,761 --> 02:31:27,510
she's a comedy store comedian one. It's
just one of those people where it's like,

2621
02:31:27,540 --> 02:31:32,100
that's why every time you follow her at
the store to education, you just learn,

2622
02:31:33,000 --> 02:31:34,770
man.
You gotta go up there and focus.

2623
02:31:35,340 --> 02:31:39,930
And she did some on Saturday night live
where she did an old bit that she's been

2624
02:31:39,931 --> 02:31:44,310
doing together about how she would have
been a first round draft pick in slave

2625
02:31:44,311 --> 02:31:49,311
days cause she would put out great slaves
and she did it on there and internet

2626
02:31:49,381 --> 02:31:53,940
explodes. She'd gets out of her bunch of
people did, including other comedians,

2627
02:31:53,941 --> 02:31:55,710
which I really hate,
man.

2628
02:31:56,070 --> 02:31:58,140
I need to wait and wait and
wait and wait and wait a minute.

2629
02:31:58,350 --> 02:32:03,270
She said she'd be a first
round draft pick. If these
is, she's a slave girl. Yeah.

2630
02:32:03,271 --> 02:32:07,590
She's a big tall, thick chick. Why would
constantly love to ask you for Dick,

2631
02:32:07,680 --> 02:32:09,120
why would that be controversial?

2632
02:32:09,450 --> 02:32:14,380
That's funny because well the whole
thing was at that one chick up, uh,

2633
02:32:14,490 --> 02:32:18,720
prettiest person in the world. It was
the girl from 12 years a slave. Right.

2634
02:32:19,250 --> 02:32:22,230
She on she it,
that's kind of where it started from.

2635
02:32:22,231 --> 02:32:25,950
Like what draft pick she would have been
and how Leslie would have been a first

2636
02:32:25,951 --> 02:32:29,520
round draft pick. Right. Cause she
could put out strong stock. You know,

2637
02:32:30,030 --> 02:32:33,760
you talk about that on stage wanting
to fuck a gladiator check. Yeah.

2638
02:32:33,761 --> 02:32:36,240
I wanted to make some fun like John Jones,
his mom,

2639
02:32:36,241 --> 02:32:38,090
I don't want to get in trouble,
but you know,

2640
02:32:38,370 --> 02:32:41,350
you know just the whole thing
about know how amazing that one.

2641
02:32:41,630 --> 02:32:45,540
Oh Mr all love for my oak.
It's all my luck.

2642
02:32:45,660 --> 02:32:48,690
He's just saying theoretically
in the joke universe.

2643
02:32:48,930 --> 02:32:52,830
Well she put out three super
top and super athletes.

2644
02:32:52,831 --> 02:32:55,320
That's the amazing woman.
That's the point of the joke.

2645
02:32:55,350 --> 02:32:57,320
And he had nothing to do with slavery.

2646
02:32:57,330 --> 02:33:00,120
Has to do with how amazing
she is and well that's,

2647
02:33:00,150 --> 02:33:04,500
that's what Leslie can you pull up?
Leslie Jones is ran on a,

2648
02:33:04,740 --> 02:33:08,730
she did it on weekend update. You know
how the whole thing was that you know,

2649
02:33:08,731 --> 02:33:12,600
so and I like didn't have enough
diversity, especially when it came to,

2650
02:33:12,810 --> 02:33:15,180
she was my mentor. I live,
she's on sending her life.

2651
02:33:15,181 --> 02:33:20,181
She did us a little monologue on
weekend update and people flipped out.

2652
02:33:21,180 --> 02:33:23,550
Oh okay.
I'm so fucking confused.

2653
02:33:23,551 --> 02:33:26,190
Cause you were saying it was a part
of her comedy special, but no, no.

2654
02:33:26,191 --> 02:33:30,930
It's a part of her standup act and she
did as a monologue on Saturday night live.

2655
02:33:30,990 --> 02:33:34,680
Why don't you do that? Because it was
weekend update and they would put to the,

2656
02:33:34,830 --> 02:33:38,430
she probably pitched it as a
little thing for that girl getting,

2657
02:33:40,200 --> 02:33:42,900
pulling it up. Well, yeah, I think
we'd like, you know, if we're smart,

2658
02:33:42,901 --> 02:33:45,200
we should hear both versions.
We should hear the,

2659
02:33:45,250 --> 02:33:49,200
the special version and the
version that she did on,

2660
02:33:49,350 --> 02:33:51,630
let's hear the fucking version
she did on comedy central.

2661
02:33:51,631 --> 02:33:55,770
Fuck the Saturday night live version.
But I think the Senate I live versions,

2662
02:33:55,771 --> 02:33:58,650
the one that got in trouble. Yeah,
but it's the same thing, right?

2663
02:33:59,130 --> 02:34:03,330
Is it on her special? I just seen her do
it at the comedy store a thousand times.

2664
02:34:03,331 --> 02:34:05,790
I think he only did it at the comedy
store. I don't think that was on,

2665
02:34:06,390 --> 02:34:09,990
I couldn't imagine someone would really
get upset about that. Oh yeah. I mean,

2666
02:34:10,410 --> 02:34:13,080
you just hear comics laying
into her and I'm just like,

2667
02:34:13,081 --> 02:34:18,040
what do what fucking comic who? Ah,
don't say Jamie Kelsey. I actually

2668
02:34:18,040 --> 02:34:20,500
tweeted the comic that did it and he,

2669
02:34:20,700 --> 02:34:25,060
he wrote me back saying that he took
down all of his posts about it and he

2670
02:34:25,061 --> 02:34:29,350
retracted everything about it. Oh,
cool. So what the fuck happened, man?

2671
02:34:30,250 --> 02:34:34,090
What was it all about? Uh,
oh, Shang I know Shang. Yeah,

2672
02:34:34,690 --> 02:34:39,520
he did it. Yeah. Oh, oh, got a little
crazy. Maybe he was drunk. Yeah,

2673
02:34:39,610 --> 02:34:42,640
I mean you took it down. So, yeah. Well,
I don't know who we're attracted it. Well,

2674
02:34:42,641 --> 02:34:44,320
I just, I just think you should, I,

2675
02:34:44,321 --> 02:34:49,321
I don't understand that the thought of
restricting what people can say you were,

2676
02:34:49,440 --> 02:34:52,390
it's reward and punishment.
If you like what he says,

2677
02:34:52,391 --> 02:34:56,740
you reward him by going to his shows,
buying a CD. If you don't like it,

2678
02:34:56,860 --> 02:34:59,530
you don't go to his shows.
You don't buy cds.

2679
02:34:59,680 --> 02:35:04,300
I disagree because I think that if someone
is saying something evil and hurtful,

2680
02:35:04,390 --> 02:35:06,860
that there's nothing wrong
with going after that and all,

2681
02:35:06,890 --> 02:35:09,990
nothing wrong with pointing out that
something is evil or hurtful. Right.

2682
02:35:10,180 --> 02:35:14,320
But when something is just a joke about
themselves and their own body and their

2683
02:35:14,321 --> 02:35:19,120
own race in their own origins, I mean,
and the idea that this is good. I play it.

2684
02:35:22,390 --> 02:35:24,300
Thank you very much.

2685
02:35:24,940 --> 02:35:26,340
Hello everybody.
Uh,

2686
02:35:26,380 --> 02:35:31,000
I wanted to come out here tonight and
congratulate the Peter on winning people's

2687
02:35:31,090 --> 02:35:35,350
most beautiful person.
And I agreed that she is very beautiful.

2688
02:35:35,620 --> 02:35:37,000
But for me personally,

2689
02:35:37,001 --> 02:35:41,530
I'm waiting for them to put out the most
useful list. You know what I'm saying?

2690
02:35:41,700 --> 02:35:45,730
Cause that's where I'm going. Shot
most useful. That's what I said.

2691
02:35:45,731 --> 02:35:50,380
You delectable Caucasian
asking for Dick. By the way,

2692
02:35:50,390 --> 02:35:51,340
let me ask you a question.

2693
02:35:51,490 --> 02:35:54,790
If you walked into a club and you saw
me and lapita standing at the bar,

2694
02:35:55,270 --> 02:35:58,900
who would you pick? Wow. Yeah, I
know you would pick lapita. Wow.

2695
02:35:58,930 --> 02:36:01,360
Well let me ask you this.
If he was in the parking lot,

2696
02:36:05,620 --> 02:36:06,020
three

2697
02:36:06,020 --> 02:36:10,460
crips is about to whoop yo ass.
Who Do you going to pick?

2698
02:36:12,050 --> 02:36:13,490
I would pick you.
You're damn right.

2699
02:36:13,690 --> 02:36:14,523
Sure.

2700
02:36:17,010 --> 02:36:21,810
And that's my point. The way we view
black beauty has changed. Look at me. See,

2701
02:36:21,840 --> 02:36:25,020
see, I'm single right now.
But back in the sleigh days,

2702
02:36:25,140 --> 02:36:30,140
I would have never been single six
feet tall and I'm strong Kotlin Straub.

2703
02:36:31,670 --> 02:36:32,670
I may look at me,

2704
02:36:32,671 --> 02:36:37,230
I'm a Mandingo saying you'd
rather be a slave. No,

2705
02:36:37,320 --> 02:36:40,230
that is not what I'm saying. I
do not want to be a slave. Hell,

2706
02:36:40,260 --> 02:36:44,280
I don't like working for you. White
people right now. Y'All pay me.

2707
02:36:46,440 --> 02:36:48,480
I'm just saying that
back in the slave days,

2708
02:36:48,481 --> 02:36:50,880
my love life would have been way better.

2709
02:36:51,180 --> 02:36:55,470
Master would hook me up with the best
brother owned the plantation and every

2710
02:36:55,471 --> 02:36:57,870
nine months I'll be in the
corner having a super baby.

2711
02:36:59,190 --> 02:37:03,140
Every night I'd just be in a corner
just popping them out just up.

2712
02:37:06,870 --> 02:37:11,470
No Bra.
Both slaps.

2713
02:37:16,190 --> 02:37:17,930
That's what I'm saying.
I'm saying

2714
02:37:18,870 --> 02:37:21,960
the number one slave draft pick.

2715
02:37:22,160 --> 02:37:22,993
Okay.

2716
02:37:24,210 --> 02:37:25,500
Plantations move on me.

2717
02:37:25,650 --> 02:37:28,050
I'll be on television like
Lebron announcing which planes.

2718
02:37:30,660 --> 02:37:33,690
I like to take my talents
to South Carolina.

2719
02:37:36,220 --> 02:37:40,810
I do believe that there's going to be a
lot of opportunities there for me. Now.

2720
02:37:40,930 --> 02:37:43,870
I can't even get a brother to
take me out for a cheap dinner.

2721
02:37:44,380 --> 02:37:46,320
I mean damn 10 a bitch get a beef bar.

2722
02:37:52,010 --> 02:37:53,510
It's weird that she had to do that.

2723
02:37:54,810 --> 02:37:57,600
It's weird shit to do it like that.
Like using him as I go, like Oh,

2724
02:37:57,660 --> 02:38:01,200
got a banter back and forth to make
it look like it wasn't a bit fucking

2725
02:38:01,201 --> 02:38:05,460
hilarious. So it was funny. I bet it's
even better on stage though. She's uh,

2726
02:38:05,790 --> 02:38:09,780
she's dude, we call like a,
we call their education man.

2727
02:38:09,781 --> 02:38:13,270
You got her to education cause you
got to learn to survive. She sweat.

2728
02:38:13,300 --> 02:38:16,120
Oh she loves the sweat
and Hog. Yeah. Yeah.

2729
02:38:16,200 --> 02:38:20,070
And then she used to corner me in the
back during the Dublin's days and just beg

2730
02:38:20,071 --> 02:38:23,550
for Dick. It was so great. How long
ago was this? Back in Dublin's Day.

2731
02:38:23,551 --> 02:38:25,350
You remember that girl? Was
this, what year was that?

2732
02:38:25,560 --> 02:38:30,090
Dublin's was like 2006
was it 2000 so yeah,

2733
02:38:30,160 --> 02:38:34,590
I'd say 2003 or four. Three or
four. Yeah. It was the early days.

2734
02:38:34,830 --> 02:38:36,180
Well Dublin's changed.
You know,

2735
02:38:36,330 --> 02:38:39,930
Dublin's was like a spot where it's like
a very few people were going and then

2736
02:38:39,931 --> 02:38:42,270
it became like a Dane Cook
spot for awhile. Yeah.

2737
02:38:42,290 --> 02:38:47,290
While the Fryer I sit the first year or
two it was great because you know Jay

2738
02:38:47,310 --> 02:38:48,020
Davis and Ahmed Ahmed,

2739
02:38:48,020 --> 02:38:52,260
it brought in this pretty insane
crowd and like you know people,

2740
02:38:52,410 --> 02:38:55,320
you would go up there and you find out
how good comedian you were and if he did

2741
02:38:55,321 --> 02:39:00,321
really well there were widespread and
then there's a thing where I'm not going

2742
02:39:00,331 --> 02:39:03,660
on after him and you've got to put
me on beforehand and people started

2743
02:39:03,661 --> 02:39:04,770
controlling the lineup,

2744
02:39:05,030 --> 02:39:09,090
sort of become a prima Donna and doing
an hour in the middle of the show and

2745
02:39:09,091 --> 02:39:11,060
stealing people's material,

2746
02:39:11,170 --> 02:39:14,310
sitting in the back watching and saying
that they were going to get their

2747
02:39:14,311 --> 02:39:17,130
lawyers on you if you kept doing
the bit that happened to me.

2748
02:39:17,180 --> 02:39:21,660
And that happened to you Dane Cook,
that's crazy. Sam Aaa. What happened?

2749
02:39:21,661 --> 02:39:25,770
What was the bit,
I did a bit about the time.

2750
02:39:26,460 --> 02:39:30,270
I was a big tool fan at the time.
And I did and I still am,

2751
02:39:30,271 --> 02:39:33,450
but I did a bit about when I got pulled
over by the cops and they wrote me a

2752
02:39:33,810 --> 02:39:38,160
ticket for like two 50 for speeding.
And he handed to me and I said thank you.

2753
02:39:38,650 --> 02:39:42,360
And I remember how stupid that was to
say thank you for this fucking ticket.

2754
02:39:42,620 --> 02:39:46,020
And I at the time I'm like, that's like
saying thank you after get prison rape.

2755
02:39:46,350 --> 02:39:49,800
And I used the line, I'm breathing so
I guess I'm still alive. Thank you.

2756
02:39:49,801 --> 02:39:51,930
Which is a,
a lyric from a tool song.

2757
02:39:52,200 --> 02:39:55,770
And they did on stage cause I
was showcasing for Jamie and I,

2758
02:39:56,100 --> 02:39:59,250
Jamie made me this thing showcase
regular where I would always just get to

2759
02:39:59,251 --> 02:40:00,060
showcase.

2760
02:40:00,060 --> 02:40:04,410
And then I just became a regular really
quick and I was going to do a showcase

2761
02:40:04,411 --> 02:40:07,350
and Jamie didn't show up. So I'm like, I'm
just gonna do my regular set, you know?

2762
02:40:07,590 --> 02:40:11,040
And so I go up and I started doing my
act and I do that joke where I'm like, I,

2763
02:40:11,250 --> 02:40:13,080
you know,
I basically did the joke and I got,

2764
02:40:13,350 --> 02:40:16,710
I got huge laughs and I'm
leaving there. And, uh,

2765
02:40:16,900 --> 02:40:20,730
all these comics who were my friends were
hanging out in the laugh factory lobby

2766
02:40:21,150 --> 02:40:23,910
and it was like Butch Bradley and a
couple of other people and Dane was there.

2767
02:40:23,911 --> 02:40:27,930
And I didn't really know Dane by
new of Dane. So I'm leaving with my,

2768
02:40:27,960 --> 02:40:28,800
with Scott Ross.

2769
02:40:29,010 --> 02:40:33,390
Time
is a picture of him shirtless.

2770
02:40:33,960 --> 02:40:37,170
So I, uh, I do the, I, you know
what I'm saying goodbye to everyone.

2771
02:40:37,171 --> 02:40:39,810
And I'm with Scott Ross,
who was my roommate at the time,

2772
02:40:40,500 --> 02:40:44,300
and I say goodbye to everybody and I saw
Dan and go, Hey Dane, thank you Mike.

2773
02:40:44,310 --> 02:40:45,830
Hey Dan, I'll see you
later. And he goes, Yep.

2774
02:40:45,930 --> 02:40:50,580
Oh, by the way, you're doing my bit
in front of everybody and I go, what?

2775
02:40:51,390 --> 02:40:56,050
And all of a sudden, armo rage just starts
coming through me. Armo rage and range.

2776
02:40:56,190 --> 02:41:00,660
Yeah, just that arm RMO rage.
And this is his latest Instagram.

2777
02:41:01,110 --> 02:41:06,110
He's got his shirt off and bedrooms
sucking the stomach into the point where

2778
02:41:06,511 --> 02:41:08,760
he's probably losing circulation.

2779
02:41:10,440 --> 02:41:15,210
He mean that is read the caption.
Does it say,

2780
02:41:15,230 --> 02:41:19,320
oh, well that's a caption and a half.
Read the caption. Thank you too. Okay.

2781
02:41:19,390 --> 02:41:24,000
Ah, all my fans and friends over my
career. I'm starting a new film next week,

2782
02:41:24,030 --> 02:41:24,391
writing,

2783
02:41:24,391 --> 02:41:29,340
then my next one and prepping a lot for
a press tours and interviews over the

2784
02:41:29,340 --> 02:41:33,720
next couple of months for planes to
a huge surprise and a huge and a huge

2785
02:41:33,721 --> 02:41:38,340
surprise. I'm in the best place in
my life. I love the people around me.

2786
02:41:38,370 --> 02:41:43,230
I have let go over my past and that held
me and I've embraced a future that is

2787
02:41:43,231 --> 02:41:44,700
whatever I want it to be.

2788
02:41:44,880 --> 02:41:48,630
I've worked with wonderful
charity organizations over
the years and I'm grateful

2789
02:41:48,631 --> 02:41:53,400
to have always given back and being
mindful that the future success depends on

2790
02:41:53,401 --> 02:41:56,590
how I can create for others now.
Oh

2791
02:41:57,530 --> 02:42:01,510
hmm. How and sign hardware. The
more pound signs by the way,

2792
02:42:01,511 --> 02:42:04,270
you have after you fucking statements
to more. I think you're an idiot.

2793
02:42:04,630 --> 02:42:05,500
I'm just going to let you know more.

2794
02:42:05,650 --> 02:42:10,650
The more time you Hashtag yeah fucking
you have more than three hashtags.

2795
02:42:10,961 --> 02:42:13,800
I can't really talk to you unless
they're really funny. Yeah.

2796
02:42:13,940 --> 02:42:16,630
And the last one of them says one thing,
one of them says not really.

2797
02:42:16,631 --> 02:42:19,300
And in the next one says something
even funnier. Other than that,

2798
02:42:19,301 --> 02:42:23,770
if you have a fuck fuck five or six
motivational hashtags like what he needs a

2799
02:42:23,771 --> 02:42:27,420
hug man. I mean maybe it's trying
to be ironic or funny Plone what's,

2800
02:42:27,470 --> 02:42:31,850
what's that Hashtag lets stop shitting
on Dane here. Jay Did you have an aging?

2801
02:42:32,980 --> 02:42:33,940
He's a,
you know it's,

2802
02:42:33,970 --> 02:42:37,780
it's interesting guys that were all
like in this great place at one point in

2803
02:42:37,781 --> 02:42:41,410
time and then everything is kind of like
kicked out from under them, you know?

2804
02:42:41,470 --> 02:42:46,290
And with Dane, like the allegations of
plagiarism, the, the Louis CK thing,

2805
02:42:46,490 --> 02:42:50,560
it was very similar in a lot of ways to
the Carlos men see it thing. It's just,

2806
02:42:50,680 --> 02:42:54,340
well I think men see us worse because he
found out that people found out it was

2807
02:42:54,341 --> 02:42:58,900
a Mexican. That's th that's why
it's, he lost that whole group.

2808
02:42:59,380 --> 02:43:03,160
That was devastating. You know, it's all
a lot. That's what people, Hey, I mean,

2809
02:43:03,161 --> 02:43:04,420
you'll always,
no matter what,

2810
02:43:04,421 --> 02:43:08,890
you'll always have a core group of fans
that no matter what people say with you

2811
02:43:08,980 --> 02:43:10,840
about you,
they're going to stick with you.

2812
02:43:10,870 --> 02:43:13,690
But Dane Cook thing was so crazy
that people were sending it to me.

2813
02:43:14,080 --> 02:43:16,000
Like people were like,
like laughing,

2814
02:43:16,220 --> 02:43:17,860
let's not go through all
his fucking Instagram,

2815
02:43:18,080 --> 02:43:21,850
but peep that people were sending it
to me going, what the fuck is this?

2816
02:43:22,120 --> 02:43:25,450
It's interesting. I don't know. Well,
I mean, he's trying to pump himself up.

2817
02:43:25,451 --> 02:43:28,840
He's getting excited about things,
trying to be positive. I get all that.

2818
02:43:28,910 --> 02:43:32,300
I know he went through a really dark
time, so that's kind of suck. Why? Why,

2819
02:43:32,440 --> 02:43:35,830
why he's standing there with your stomach
sucked in like that, looking all sexy

2820
02:43:36,390 --> 02:43:39,150
because maybe that's his cry. I
don't know, man. It's just like,

2821
02:43:39,460 --> 02:43:41,500
you should do that. You,
you know what you should do.

2822
02:43:41,620 --> 02:43:45,310
You should do like the same
thing that, um, that uh,

2823
02:43:45,520 --> 02:43:50,080
Steevo did with Angelina Jolie
where all the tattoos that she gets,

2824
02:43:50,350 --> 02:43:54,490
he gets this, you should do the same
thing with all Dane. Cook's tweets, Elvis,

2825
02:43:54,491 --> 02:43:55,900
and every time he does an Instagram,

2826
02:43:56,020 --> 02:43:59,950
you should do an Instagram in the
exact same pose with the exact same

2827
02:44:00,020 --> 02:44:04,630
caption. Hope my tits hanging out. I
mean considering what you just told us,

2828
02:44:04,631 --> 02:44:08,230
you know that whole thing. Oh that
was long. I know, I know, I know.

2829
02:44:08,231 --> 02:44:11,350
But it would be fun for a week
project for one, for one week.

2830
02:44:12,190 --> 02:44:16,240
Every time I do the same work thing,
he does just the same words,

2831
02:44:16,350 --> 02:44:17,230
same everything.

2832
02:44:18,770 --> 02:44:22,250
Poor bastard. He ain't a bad guy. Did
you, did you think he had a hard life?

2833
02:44:22,350 --> 02:44:25,440
Do you see that fight that as Seth
Rogan's doing with Macklemore right now,

2834
02:44:25,500 --> 02:44:29,880
now it's Macklemore. I thought it was
fine with Macklemore. Did that kind of,

2835
02:44:30,200 --> 02:44:34,980
he put on a costume and a lot of people
say it was a antisemetic cause it's like

2836
02:44:34,981 --> 02:44:36,490
it is.
Oh yeah,

2837
02:44:36,590 --> 02:44:37,700
I saw that.
He said,

2838
02:44:37,760 --> 02:44:41,810
hey that it sort of just a random costume
that a wig and a fake nose is just a

2839
02:44:41,811 --> 02:44:44,130
random costume.
It looks Hasidic.

2840
02:44:44,410 --> 02:44:47,500
Yeah, look at that. I mean that's
ridiculous that if he's even saying,

2841
02:44:48,510 --> 02:44:52,280
let me see the, the photo. The
image. Hold on. I gotta get it fixed.

2842
02:44:53,490 --> 02:44:56,440
Macklemore's the one who did it.
That's it right there at the grammys.

2843
02:44:56,460 --> 02:44:58,850
Who's the guy who's mad at him?

2844
02:44:59,430 --> 02:45:02,910
I think that's just Randy from American
idol or something. But yeah, that's,

2845
02:45:02,911 --> 02:45:07,350
I mean he says it's just a random witches
nose and a wig and something like that.

2846
02:45:07,351 --> 02:45:08,850
I'm like, yeah. What
are you trying to make?

2847
02:45:08,851 --> 02:45:10,560
What else are you
supposed to be right now?

2848
02:45:10,680 --> 02:45:10,921
Okay,

2849
02:45:10,921 --> 02:45:14,100
so what is a Seth Rogen say first you
tricked people into pretending you're a

2850
02:45:14,101 --> 02:45:16,500
rapper. Now you tricked them
into thinking you're Jewish.

2851
02:45:16,680 --> 02:45:19,560
Yeah. If you go to is Seth
Rogan's a thing? He's,

2852
02:45:19,620 --> 02:45:24,270
he's going back and forth with them
all day. Like, cause Macklemore's said,

2853
02:45:24,300 --> 02:45:28,440
uh, a fake, which is knows wig
and a beard equals random costume.

2854
02:45:28,441 --> 02:45:32,730
Not my idea of a stereotype of any,
anyone and then any, any anybody's.

2855
02:45:32,760 --> 02:45:34,350
And then Seth Rogan guys,
Mac more really,

2856
02:45:34,351 --> 02:45:37,650
because if I told somebody to put
together an antisemitic geo costume, they,

2857
02:45:37,670 --> 02:45:40,910
they have the exact same
shopping list and you know, yeah.

2858
02:45:41,030 --> 02:45:45,620
Okay. But here's my question. Why is it
antisemetic cause he's got a big note.

2859
02:45:45,630 --> 02:45:47,240
So what?
What if you did one,

2860
02:45:47,300 --> 02:45:50,390
it was an Italian guy and he had a wife
beater on one spaghetti stains on and a

2861
02:45:50,391 --> 02:45:51,860
lot of gold chains and he went on stage.

2862
02:45:52,580 --> 02:45:56,540
Maybe there's some fucking morons and
the Italian American anti-defamation.

2863
02:45:56,541 --> 02:45:59,750
They were playing about it. But you're
telling me that people don't exist.

2864
02:45:59,751 --> 02:46:03,140
It looked like that. They
do. That's why for me,

2865
02:46:03,141 --> 02:46:06,170
who's predominantly Italian wouldn't have
a problem with someone to be on stage

2866
02:46:06,171 --> 02:46:10,010
with a wife beater on and gold chains
with pizza stains it. I mean you could,

2867
02:46:10,011 --> 02:46:13,430
you could make a stereotypical
Italian outfit and no one care. Why.

2868
02:46:13,431 --> 02:46:16,740
If you made an outfit that makes
you look like an acidic chew,

2869
02:46:16,760 --> 02:46:18,530
why is that Anti Hasidic Jew?

2870
02:46:18,950 --> 02:46:23,090
If you can tell that that
looks like a Jew, why is that?

2871
02:46:23,150 --> 02:46:26,270
Antisemetic because Jews are
sensitive, but right. I mean,

2872
02:46:26,271 --> 02:46:29,090
you know what I'm saying? I mean, look,
we're not talking about blackface here.

2873
02:46:29,330 --> 02:46:32,420
Black face has a history of the Minstrel,
you know?

2874
02:46:32,600 --> 02:46:34,370
Well juice would say there was a,
you know,

2875
02:46:34,371 --> 02:46:37,080
there was a lot anti Hebrew propaganda.

2876
02:46:37,081 --> 02:46:40,310
It was there in Germany that
lead to the expression as well,

2877
02:46:40,490 --> 02:46:45,140
a third of their population. There was
but, but is that what that is? Cause the,

2878
02:46:45,141 --> 02:46:46,970
did they dress up?
You know what I'm saying?

2879
02:46:46,971 --> 02:46:50,270
Like I think it goes back minstrel
shows. It was tent, right?

2880
02:46:50,420 --> 02:46:55,420
I don't think Macklemore who had gay
marriage on his grammy song while he did a

2881
02:46:56,541 --> 02:47:01,220
grammy song is going to be antisemitic.
I Dunno, maybe I'm wrong, but I don't,

2882
02:47:01,280 --> 02:47:04,780
I don't feel that. But people
are like, there's a lot of sense.

2883
02:47:04,880 --> 02:47:07,490
They're not all Ari where they
can joke about it all the time.

2884
02:47:07,490 --> 02:47:10,490
Like something we're very sensitive
about that. It's too sensitive,

2885
02:47:10,491 --> 02:47:12,860
I think in that situation.
I just think, look,

2886
02:47:12,890 --> 02:47:16,880
if you dressed up like a Hasidic Jew, all
right. Say if you went on stage. Okay.

2887
02:47:17,120 --> 02:47:21,730
What's a, the rapper's name? Bad
ass rapper. Eminem. No, it guy.

2888
02:47:22,390 --> 02:47:26,330
Oh, ah, yeah. My motto, Ciu.
What did I say it again?

2889
02:47:27,320 --> 02:47:31,490
[inaudible] that guy. Montas Yahoo.
Modest yacht. Fuck you man. Say it right.

2890
02:47:31,970 --> 02:47:34,670
How dare you rude.
Um,

2891
02:47:37,210 --> 02:47:41,480
I don't even know what it was five
seconds ago, pretending I'm offended.

2892
02:47:41,870 --> 02:47:46,130
Um, Matisyahu uh, if you went
on stage dressed up like him,

2893
02:47:46,520 --> 02:47:51,290
is that antisemetic? That's, if that's how
he dresses and you dressed up like him.

2894
02:47:51,320 --> 02:47:55,070
If you said it was him, like
he was just being a Jew. Right?

2895
02:47:55,071 --> 02:47:58,130
But what was you saying?
These not just being Macklemore.

2896
02:47:58,131 --> 02:47:59,990
Was He in wearing that costume?

2897
02:47:59,991 --> 02:48:04,190
Was he like doing an offensive Jewish
accent or was he doing the same act or was

2898
02:48:04,191 --> 02:48:06,080
he just being silly?
If I can find video of it,

2899
02:48:06,590 --> 02:48:10,460
I just don't understand why
looking someone has to be
looking like someone or a

2900
02:48:10,461 --> 02:48:14,720
parody of someone has to be anti.
And I use my own nationality,

2901
02:48:15,020 --> 02:48:19,800
but I guess Italians there.
So let me ask you into being Italian,

2902
02:48:19,801 --> 02:48:23,810
that they're not really marginalized by
their, uh, well, there were people like,

2903
02:48:23,811 --> 02:48:28,600
I had a cousin, my cousin who's Italian,
he apologized. He fucking caved. Yup.

2904
02:48:28,820 --> 02:48:30,920
You never apologize.
Macklemore issues,

2905
02:48:30,921 --> 02:48:35,510
apology for antisemetic chew costume
as Seth Rogan heads out on Twitter.

2906
02:48:35,720 --> 02:48:40,310
Seth Rogan wins again. That's why
we went again. What does that,

2907
02:48:40,410 --> 02:48:42,640
that was,
that's my Seth Rogen from Yoda.

2908
02:48:42,660 --> 02:48:46,910
You fuckhead riced just stop
talking. Well, you know,

2909
02:48:46,911 --> 02:48:51,140
it's like a lot of Italians.
Hey, the soprano. So I'm
like, dude, it's not that bad.

2910
02:48:51,350 --> 02:48:56,240
It's, it's the, it's the mob. It's not
like he, he's not running gay bath house.

2911
02:48:56,241 --> 02:48:59,210
You know? It's like, it's actually
like kind of a cool, I don't know.

2912
02:48:59,211 --> 02:49:01,310
I didn't find a fence to it.
Well,

2913
02:49:01,700 --> 02:49:04,550
it's ridiculous to say that
people like that don't exist.

2914
02:49:04,551 --> 02:49:09,551
Like you're allowed to make a fictional
and if a fictional character is really

2915
02:49:10,081 --> 02:49:13,530
close to actual people, that's when
people start getting pissed off.

2916
02:49:13,770 --> 02:49:15,900
That's when people start
saying it's stereotypes.

2917
02:49:16,140 --> 02:49:20,280
But stereotypes exist for a fucking
reason. I don't know if he just went up.

2918
02:49:20,340 --> 02:49:22,110
I think you're right.
If he just went up there and

2919
02:49:22,330 --> 02:49:26,710
sang dress in that costume as him.
I don't know what the,

2920
02:49:26,980 --> 02:49:28,550
what is actually going on,
but

2921
02:49:28,750 --> 02:49:30,460
I don't read about it.
About their soprano's thing.

2922
02:49:30,461 --> 02:49:33,850
Like the idea of like
not using stereotypes is,

2923
02:49:33,851 --> 02:49:37,030
so in painting a story
is so fucking ridiculous.

2924
02:49:37,060 --> 02:49:41,050
Well because sometimes stereotypes are
accurate and if you're going to be able

2925
02:49:41,051 --> 02:49:43,870
to paint a story,
create pain and creative vision,

2926
02:49:43,871 --> 02:49:48,100
whether it's a television show or a movie,
what's wrong with having a black pimp?

2927
02:49:48,520 --> 02:49:51,760
Is that okay? I mean, it seems like
there's black pimps. There's been black,

2928
02:49:51,761 --> 02:49:55,810
I saw pimps up hoes down.
Is it a stereotype? I mean,

2929
02:49:55,840 --> 02:49:59,680
is this stereotype I tell people,
I mean, I've walked Hollywood.

2930
02:49:59,681 --> 02:50:02,710
I think stereotypes work,
especially in commercial.

2931
02:50:02,860 --> 02:50:07,450
It's like casting directors like, oh, you
fit the stereotype of the character. Why?

2932
02:50:07,600 --> 02:50:09,160
You know,
it's just not just that.

2933
02:50:09,161 --> 02:50:11,650
It's like if you want to
paint a story about real life,

2934
02:50:11,830 --> 02:50:15,300
you would paint a story about things
that people can relate to and one things

2935
02:50:15,330 --> 02:50:18,490
that people can relate to as an Italian
guy with fucking pizza stains on his t

2936
02:50:18,491 --> 02:50:22,480
shirt and gold chains on, those are
real people. We're in sweat suits.

2937
02:50:22,570 --> 02:50:25,810
If you got a guy like we're in sweatsuits
like fucking Tony Soprano, go, hey,

2938
02:50:25,900 --> 02:50:28,240
where's the gap? I'll go, where's
the fucking guy with the thing? Yeah,

2939
02:50:28,241 --> 02:50:32,500
it was his GED, the fucking GED. Those are
real people. Like you know those people.

2940
02:50:32,580 --> 02:50:36,440
If you listen to Floyd Mayweather, it's
dad. Okay, that's a real guy. Yeah.

2941
02:50:36,520 --> 02:50:38,320
It's a real old black boxer.

2942
02:50:38,590 --> 02:50:42,520
If you're going to make a parody of an
old black boxer and you had a guy who

2943
02:50:42,521 --> 02:50:45,850
could speak very well and he looked
like that guy and he started like,

2944
02:50:45,851 --> 02:50:49,930
if you've got Ian Edwards to do Floyd
Mayweather, would that be a stereotype?

2945
02:50:50,080 --> 02:50:52,160
Is it a terrorist stereotype
when he's a real person?

2946
02:50:52,161 --> 02:50:55,450
That's not that I grew out of them.
I understand it's a stereotype,

2947
02:50:55,570 --> 02:50:58,120
but shouldn't you be allowed to do
that when you're portraying fiction?

2948
02:50:58,300 --> 02:50:59,350
The idea that they,

2949
02:50:59,440 --> 02:51:03,490
that Italian American Defamation League
would want every Italian to be like

2950
02:51:03,520 --> 02:51:08,410
Leonardo Da Vinci or
Michelangelo or something like
that. Only the most positive.

2951
02:51:08,740 --> 02:51:10,900
You're not allowing
people to create fiction.

2952
02:51:11,350 --> 02:51:12,730
You're not allowing them to create art.

2953
02:51:12,800 --> 02:51:16,550
Is it because it's like actual facial
features are like Macklemore's knows or

2954
02:51:16,551 --> 02:51:17,810
Asian person's eyes.

2955
02:51:17,811 --> 02:51:21,110
That's actually what they look like
instead of wearing what they're wearing.

2956
02:51:21,260 --> 02:51:22,730
Right. Well I can see what
you're saying. So like,

2957
02:51:22,731 --> 02:51:26,180
like Jerry Lewis when he would do
like the nutty professor and he would,

2958
02:51:26,690 --> 02:51:31,670
they would, uh, the old days when they
would do like a fake Asian characters.

2959
02:51:32,800 --> 02:51:36,830
Well, that's obviously a precedent. That
was, yeah, that was very stereotypical,

2960
02:51:36,831 --> 02:51:39,490
but also very racist. What
about that famous actor, actress

2961
02:51:39,520 --> 02:51:41,280
who won as the,
uh,

2962
02:51:41,480 --> 02:51:45,010
orange is the new black character who
was black and she wanted to be that

2963
02:51:45,011 --> 02:51:47,500
character and everyone's like,
that's blackface.

2964
02:51:47,590 --> 02:51:52,360
But goes back to what is the attention? I
have no idea. Can you look that up? The,

2965
02:51:52,630 --> 02:51:57,630
the actress who went for a Halloween
costume as orange is the new black,

2966
02:51:58,060 --> 02:52:03,060
she's a hot blonde actress and she went
and black face as a Latino or black

2967
02:52:04,751 --> 02:52:06,010
character.
People like that's

2968
02:52:06,090 --> 02:52:09,400
blackface. But the intention
is if I'm a, if I'm sewing,

2969
02:52:09,401 --> 02:52:13,540
I want to go is Dwayne Wade.
There's someone when it,
that's it. That's her. Okay.

2970
02:52:13,630 --> 02:52:15,580
She loves to show what's the,

2971
02:52:15,610 --> 02:52:18,820
what's the intention there or do we
have just a set rule? Blackface. Yeah.

2972
02:52:18,821 --> 02:52:23,800
You can't, you can't even go a Tan
face. Yeah. 10 faces. Dangerous.

2973
02:52:24,100 --> 02:52:27,370
Right. If you're not tan, like
say you want to be a Brazilian,

2974
02:52:27,371 --> 02:52:32,130
you want to pretend to be Brazilian, you
can't do that. You can't do that. No, no,

2975
02:52:32,131 --> 02:52:35,530
no, no, no, no. You can't do tan
face. You can't do brown face,

2976
02:52:35,650 --> 02:52:39,490
but what you can do is wider face. If
you're a white person, white girls,

2977
02:52:39,491 --> 02:52:41,140
you can make, no, you could do,

2978
02:52:41,141 --> 02:52:45,280
a white person could make the fucking
like make their skin white as shit and

2979
02:52:45,281 --> 02:52:49,300
give themselves red hair and no one
picks up like no one picks up the slack.

2980
02:52:49,340 --> 02:52:52,810
I can go as Conan O'brien. Is that what
you're saying? That's what I'm saying.

2981
02:52:52,840 --> 02:52:56,100
Sounds like a Halloween costume.
Sam Aaa. All right, dude.

2982
02:52:56,101 --> 02:52:59,380
What's the name of your CD again?
One more time. I believe in yourself.

2983
02:52:59,410 --> 02:53:03,600
Believe in yourself, ladies and
gentlemen. It's fucking hilarious. Good.

2984
02:53:03,610 --> 02:53:07,000
It's very good material.
You can get it on iTunes or all things.

2985
02:53:07,001 --> 02:53:10,330
records.com if you get it right now,
it'll a pump Sam up.

2986
02:53:10,360 --> 02:53:14,320
Let's get them past the top 10 let's
say where he's at right now while this

2987
02:53:14,321 --> 02:53:18,360
podcast has been going on. Oh,
so we're looking for music.

2988
02:53:18,820 --> 02:53:21,360
Do we look for music and
then we'd go to genres.

2989
02:53:21,370 --> 02:53:24,910
Let's go to comedy because it's a
genre of music or some fucking reason.

2990
02:53:25,450 --> 02:53:27,040
And let's see where we're at right now.

2991
02:53:27,710 --> 02:53:31,750
Comedy albums number one
and June group are good.

2992
02:53:31,890 --> 02:53:34,100
It's been never went for a while.
He's a bad motherfucker.

2993
02:53:34,120 --> 02:53:37,780
Bullet one with the bullet. Brian
Regan's number 11. He's hilarious.

2994
02:53:38,770 --> 02:53:42,790
Louis C K is number 14.
Where are you at? Sun.

2995
02:53:43,000 --> 02:53:45,980
I guess I've dropped.
I can't find

2996
02:53:48,260 --> 02:53:51,400
a punch. Drunk sports
food. You're number eight.

2997
02:53:51,430 --> 02:53:55,870
That's why you're feeding Louis C K
man. You're beating everybody. Yay.

2998
02:53:55,871 --> 02:53:57,880
You're kicking ass, man.
You're beating Brian Regan.

2999
02:53:57,881 --> 02:54:00,730
That's why I couldn't find you
been beating Lewis Black. Powerful.

3000
02:54:01,150 --> 02:54:05,620
Just through the fucking power of the
Internet. I'm so excited to be top 10.

3001
02:54:05,650 --> 02:54:07,390
You're not on any TV shows right now.

3002
02:54:07,391 --> 02:54:10,810
He's just slamming it home to the
internets. I'm really excited.

3003
02:54:10,811 --> 02:54:14,200
Thank you everybody. That's my brother.
Congratulations. Best thing ever.

3004
02:54:14,330 --> 02:54:19,330

3010
02:54:39,790 --> 02:54:41,350
That's not what he sounds like.

3011
02:54:43,140 --> 02:54:47,380
Oh No, no, no.
