1
00:00:02,470 --> 00:00:07,230
Sweet. The Joe Rogan experience
podcast is brought to you by the foot.

2
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:12,240
We do like these two commercials
before we actually get the flashlight.

3
00:00:12,431 --> 00:00:12,640
Yeah,

4
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:17,230
we do a flash light commercial in a
commercial for on at.com but they're very

5
00:00:17,231 --> 00:00:21,730
informal. So if you want to add a
jug, Ben, even if it's derogatory,

6
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:25,270
it's free speech. We
don't mind. Um, feel free.

7
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:27,760

You should switch up the fleshlight. Yeah.

12
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:45,290
At [inaudible] ads and like
mix up boys are about, yeah,

13
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:49,750
I should just confusing that wouldn't be,
that's how appeal of paying you for it.

14
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:51,510
Can't do that.

15
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:54,120
I'm just trying to keep my mouth shut
because I don't want to be like the first

16
00:00:54,121 --> 00:00:56,220
time you had me out and
costs you your sponsors.

17
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:01,100
I've never looked at a flashlight
and went, oh man, fuck.

18
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:04,460
The shit of the concept of it
is super creative is a, yeah.

19
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:06,970
It's like you took an
apple core to a person.

20
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:11,590
This is all I'm looking forward
just despite, no, it's creepy.

21
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:16,540
And how do you hold it? You just
grab it. It's fairly textured.

22
00:01:16,541 --> 00:01:20,440
It's got like ridges to it. It's kind
of a slippery, yeah. Sort of a device.

23
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,750
I don't know why I'm
uncomfortable talking about this.

24
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:27,010
It's an uncomfortable subject.
It just is. Uh, but the,

25
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:30,630
but the Dildo isn't it? No, not
really. I mean women can laugh about,

26
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:32,820
especially when they call it a vibrator.
Yeah.

27
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:37,930
A dildo is like a big sloppy thing.
I'm a vibrator is like,

28
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:40,980
you know, up the tool of empowerment
and I've never been doing standup.

29
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:44,620
And then there's a bachelor party comes
in and guys have flashlights hanging on

30
00:01:44,621 --> 00:01:45,454
there.

31
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:50,100
He's getting married, he's
getting married. Oh my

32
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:50,521
God.

33
00:01:50,521 --> 00:01:55,080
We were in Vegas this past weekend and a
whole table full of people actually got

34
00:01:55,081 --> 00:01:58,560
up in the restaurant and said,
we have a bachelor right here.

35
00:01:58,561 --> 00:02:02,920
And they wanted everybody
to clap for, oh, so crazy.

36
00:02:02,921 --> 00:02:06,600
It's the worst part of our job.
But this wasn't even at a comedy club.

37
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:09,570
Just a restaurant.
This is just a restaurant.

38
00:02:09,571 --> 00:02:12,870
A woman just cut up and what is it that
I didn't say anything. He just said, hey,

39
00:02:12,871 --> 00:02:16,290
good luck with that.
I just didn't 50% end in divorce.

40
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:21,960
I didn't even, I said, Huh,
okay. Just do your thing. You
know, don't be too imposing.

41
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:26,040
Well, people can't comprehend an
evening without being about themselves.

42
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:28,260
That's what's the most
frustrating thing right now. Well,

43
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:31,260
I think it's also for a lot of people,
they don't like what they do.

44
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,090
They don't like their,
their situation.

45
00:02:33,091 --> 00:02:35,850
And when they have a moment
for it to be special for them,

46
00:02:35,851 --> 00:02:38,340
like you feel like a
Bachelorette party is like,

47
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:42,300
that's that girl is getting married. All
right, boom. It's her night. You know,

48
00:02:42,301 --> 00:02:43,200
she owns it.
Right.

49
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:47,220
And so it's sort of gives you this weird
cultural license to just be off fucking

50
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:51,450
terrible. Odd. Yeah. Yeah. And he away
in a way that you never should be.

51
00:02:51,451 --> 00:02:53,370
You'd never should be the one look at me.

52
00:02:53,371 --> 00:02:58,020
Look at me like who the fuck is
that person? Yeah, I uh, yeah, I,

53
00:02:58,050 --> 00:02:59,770
well we got,
we should get to your next sponsor.

54
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:05,070
Factionalism told wait
knows how to Fuckin Zack.

55
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:08,380
It's about professionalism. Yeah. Awesome.

56
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:13,160
We are also sponsored by on at.com
makers of Alpha brain. It's O, n n,

57
00:03:13,161 --> 00:03:17,360
I t.com. Makers of Alpha brain,
shroom, tech, sport, shroom, tech,

58
00:03:17,361 --> 00:03:19,520
immune and new mood.

59
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,440
If all these things
are nootropics and the,

60
00:03:22,441 --> 00:03:26,240
a couple of them are more for
athletic performance enhancing stuff,

61
00:03:26,241 --> 00:03:29,900
but the uh, what, what a nootropic
is that you should really,

62
00:03:29,901 --> 00:03:31,700
if you're interested in this stuff,
you should Google it.

63
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:35,870
It's essentially vitamins that
aid and cognitive function.

64
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:39,470
It's very controversial. I've been
using them for a long time. It's um,

65
00:03:39,471 --> 00:03:42,650
it's not like limitless. It's not
going to turn it more on into a genius,

66
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:45,830
but I do believe it has a positive
effect on the way your brain works.

67
00:03:45,831 --> 00:03:49,700
And there's, there's been studies to back
this up and more being done right now.

68
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:53,540
But the most important thing with me if
I got behind anything is to make sure

69
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:56,570
that nobody feels like they're getting
ripped off. So because of that,

70
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,690
the first 30 pills, when you buy
30, you know your first order,

71
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:03,410
you get a 100% money back guarantee.
If you try it, you don't believe in it.

72
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,470
You're not into it though. You
don't feel it. You think it sucks.

73
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:09,530
You don't even have to send it back.
You just say this stuff sucks.

74
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:12,920
You get your money back. It's
that easy. Use The coast. Uh,

75
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:18,010
you use the code word Rogan
and save yourself 10%. And uh,

76
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:20,930
that's on a.com. O. N. N. I. T.
All right ladies and gentlemen,

77
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,310
Bobcat Goldthwait is here.

78
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:25,510
Thanks for having me. Yeah, thanks for
being on. We're going to play music.

79
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:29,110
I don't know why we had
to do this experience

80
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:32,740
day.
Joe Rogan podcast by night all day.

81
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:38,170
I know a few other people's
podcast recently and uh,

82
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:42,300
a lot of people are turning them into
radio shows. They're like really produced.

83
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:44,340
I don't like the, the, the,
there's a couple of them.

84
00:04:44,341 --> 00:04:46,890
They are doing the commercial things
were like, they're like, all right now,

85
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:50,360
every 10 minutes or 15 minutes ago, all
right, now here's a sponsor. I hate that.

86
00:04:50,361 --> 00:04:54,060
That's what a lot of them are doing now.
Adam Carolla those that it's awful. Yeah.

87
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:58,590
It's weird. Everyone's, they have a
introductions. I mean, seems really slick.

88
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:02,070
It's super slick. I'm not kissing
your ass. Your introduction is the,

89
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:07,080
the briefest to, that's good. I try to
just, yeah. Get right into the show.

90
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:09,660
Yeah. Well, sometimes it's not
though. Sometimes these flashlights,

91
00:05:09,661 --> 00:05:13,140
it just goes onto a conversation about
rubber pussies that last 20 minutes.

92
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:18,620
People are hearing it now.
You're here to done iTunes. Yeah.

93
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:23,610
But they're not hearing it on a serious,
Eh, you know, whatever. Then, uh, well,

94
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:25,440
subscribe to it on iTunes.
Right.

95
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:28,760
It's definitely an extra 10 minutes
each show about rubber pussies.

96
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:31,770
Usually just the con, well, it's,

97
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:36,030
it's a weird thing like as a human being.
Like, we all know that we masturbate,

98
00:05:36,031 --> 00:05:40,820
but we, you know, we're comedians and
yet we both really uncomfortable. Right.

99
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:43,230
While we're talking about
fucking this rubber pussy,

100
00:05:43,231 --> 00:05:48,090
like it's a weird thing to
admit this human need it for,

101
00:05:48,091 --> 00:05:51,240
you know, to, cause it's like
breaking up with your hand.

102
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:56,760
That's why I had some weird, it is
a little bit, a little bit. Yeah.

103
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,220
She tried to fake yourself

104
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:02,630
out. Yeah, it's definitely a fake out.
I uh, we were talking to me about,

105
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:07,430
uh, about the Bachelorette party, the,
the, the bane of the comedy a thing.

106
00:06:07,431 --> 00:06:12,230
But I had a group of women in Sioux City,
Sioux falls,

107
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:15,680
I can't remember which
one, but um, came in late,

108
00:06:15,681 --> 00:06:19,280
sat and took over the whole show,
just wouldn't shut up, you know, and,

109
00:06:19,281 --> 00:06:23,300
and I do my stock Glines about quieting
people down and they're not going to,

110
00:06:23,301 --> 00:06:26,360
and they're going to make it all about
themselves the whole night. And, uh,

111
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:28,640
it got to the point where the
crowds are, they going, you know,

112
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:31,220
kick them out and stuff.
And then finally, like,

113
00:06:31,221 --> 00:06:35,900
I have this rage that I don't love or
I'm proud of, but you know, it's there.

114
00:06:35,901 --> 00:06:39,210
And so it's so fun. I go, okay, you
want the show to be about you. You know?

115
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:42,290
And it's like, whoa. And I really
don't know what I'm saying during that.

116
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:46,820
I'm serious. It's just like, Oh
ah, you know, and Sanger just pure.

117
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:51,380
Yeah. And so I stopped because the
crowds cheering because by the way,

118
00:06:51,381 --> 00:06:55,790
like a comedy club, people love tension.
They love conflict. You know what I mean?

119
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:57,620
A bars never empty because you said,

120
00:06:57,621 --> 00:07:01,260
hey chill guys are getting along in
the parking lot. Let's watch. So,

121
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:05,240
so the crowds cheering and then I go back
and I started doing my act and all of

122
00:07:05,241 --> 00:07:08,960
a sudden one of the women in the middle
of the group stands up and she's sobbing

123
00:07:08,961 --> 00:07:13,130
and she goes, I'm not a
whore. It's my birthday. Oh.

124
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:16,910
Cause apparently in the
middle of the Diageo

125
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:23,690
he called her a whore and I remember it.
Wow. I'm not a whore. It's my birthday.

126
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,720
That's a good tee shirt.
Maybe that'll be my, uh,

127
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,260
that's going to be my good are done.
That's going to be mine.

128
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,380
I'll be selling them after shows.
We get through that a,

129
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:39,200
it's my birthday. I show hold a
tee shirt up at the end of my set.

130
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:44,850
It is bizarre how many people that think
they have like some license to be a con

131
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:48,470
because it's their birthday.
Well, just, just so weird.

132
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:53,330
It's my birthday weekend too.
It's not the just one day anymore.

133
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:56,960
It's like the whole week
and guys do it also.

134
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:58,880
Like I saw a guy the other day
was his birthday and I'm like,

135
00:07:58,881 --> 00:08:01,610
when is your birthday? I don't want to
say hit the comic is, and he's just like,

136
00:08:01,611 --> 00:08:04,040
oh, it was Wednesday. And I'm like,
you're telling everyone to buy his shots.

137
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:07,670
It's Friday. Your birthday was two
days ago. You're a grown man. What?

138
00:08:07,671 --> 00:08:11,840
The hours were long weird. Is it to get
super excited? Hey about your birthday,

139
00:08:11,841 --> 00:08:16,370
but be about like the days are
rounded, right? Your birthday. Wow.

140
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:17,810
What the fuck?

141
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:23,330
I had a birthday Saturday and uh,
that was, uh, it's depressing.

142
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:27,320
I turned 50 but everyone always thinks
I'm a lot older. Right? They always think,

143
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,050
because I look, I know, I
know I'm not aging gracefully,

144
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:31,760
but people always think I'm a lot older.

145
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:36,560
But I got on Letterman was 27
doing this for a long time. Man,

146
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:41,870
Boston, a Boston by weight. But I also
started like in Syracuse and then,

147
00:08:41,871 --> 00:08:44,870
and then,
and then I moved to Boston was like 18.

148
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,880
You were a part of that crazy time
period of Boston comedy, Boston comedy.

149
00:08:49,881 --> 00:08:53,500
Like if you look back at all the
great comedians that came out of that,

150
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:56,340
that one town really incredible

151
00:08:56,780 --> 00:09:01,200
even right. And Jay Leno and you know, I
mean there's so many guys when he Clark,

152
00:09:01,201 --> 00:09:03,570
there were so many great
guys that came out of Boston

153
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:07,240
when I was there.
It was Steve Wright and uh,

154
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:10,600
Paula Poundstone and well, a lot
of guys are still there. Like Tony,

155
00:09:10,601 --> 00:09:15,380
me and Barry Crimmins, Kenny Rogers
in and Mike Dunn at Sweeney. Yeah.

156
00:09:15,381 --> 00:09:19,040
All those guys. Uh, it was a
really, really, really crazy part,

157
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:21,290
but I didn't realize it.
I guess it wasn't

158
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:25,120
that crazy and other cities and it
must've been right. I don't know. I mean,

159
00:09:25,121 --> 00:09:26,170
I think that was the,

160
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:31,230
I think that spot your spot in the 80s
was it like it was like early eighties,

161
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:34,870
like 80 yeah.
That was like the,

162
00:09:34,871 --> 00:09:37,360
I think that was like the
best spot ever in the country.

163
00:09:37,361 --> 00:09:40,060
I don't think there's ever
been that many great comedians.

164
00:09:40,061 --> 00:09:43,430
It came out of one spot, but it was one
of them that people don't even know about

165
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:48,790
Jordy of the comedy clubs at that time
in Boston we're kind of ran and booked by

166
00:09:48,891 --> 00:09:52,670
the comics. So that's why. And like if
you were derivative of someone else,

167
00:09:52,671 --> 00:09:55,160
you would get kind of iced
out of a scene and stuff. So

168
00:09:55,340 --> 00:10:00,260
you, yeah, you're, you had
a really original group. It
was a very original group,

169
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:03,570
but it was really insane.
I remember being like with uh,

170
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,790
I dunno why he would
tell a story like this,

171
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:10,590
but I remember like I don't drink or take
drugs and people don't know that cause

172
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:14,070
cause I always seem like I'm
fucked up anyways. You know?

173
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:17,450
But you don't do anything. No, no.
And I haven't since I was 19. Wow.

174
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:22,900
Those crazy performances that you did
completely stone sober. Yeah. Yeah.

175
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,130
It makes him ever more
impressive and frightening.

176
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,230
Oh. But he was kind
of, I think it's weird.

177
00:10:27,231 --> 00:10:29,870
It's like people will blame drugs
for that stuff and it's like,

178
00:10:29,871 --> 00:10:33,410
what are you on drugs? You don't scream
and run around, you know what I mean?

179
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:37,870
What kind of drugs are you on?
Like what makes you do that?

180
00:10:37,871 --> 00:10:41,140
You know? Uh, but yeah,
but I think like, uh,

181
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:46,010
like really straight people assume that
that's what happens when you're on drugs.

182
00:10:46,011 --> 00:10:50,090
You know what I mean? Right. That's funny.
Yeah. You're like a fake drugged out guy.

183
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:55,340
Like when Charlie Sheen was
having his manic episodes,

184
00:10:55,341 --> 00:10:59,120
instead of feeling bad for
the guy, everybody was like
going, oh, he's on drugs.

185
00:10:59,121 --> 00:10:59,954
You know?
That's,

186
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:04,280
that's someone who's a huge nerd that's
never done drugs saying that he's on

187
00:11:04,281 --> 00:11:06,680
drugs. You know? It's like when
you're on drugs, you don't go,

188
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:10,040
I need a press conference.
You know, you're on drugs,

189
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:14,720
you stand here in the closet thinking
black helicopters are flying over under

190
00:11:14,721 --> 00:11:17,810
the couch. I mean, if you're
having bad experiences on drugs,

191
00:11:17,811 --> 00:11:20,330
I think that's why people
don't think I'm sober either,

192
00:11:20,331 --> 00:11:23,630
because I'm not one of these annoying
people that thinks people shouldn't be on

193
00:11:23,631 --> 00:11:28,250
drugs. You know? I, you know,
I'm not against them. I just,

194
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:30,770
I blew it, you know what I mean? But I,

195
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:34,340
I feel uncomfortable around people
who don't drink or take drugs,

196
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:36,540
you know what I mean? Like, well,

197
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:40,550
I think that's part of growing up doing
comedy where I did two or the life I

198
00:11:40,551 --> 00:11:41,480
grew up as a kid,

199
00:11:41,481 --> 00:11:46,220
but I remember being in Boston and this
was when I still did drink and, uh,

200
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:49,520
doing drugs. I was doing
a, I remember that I,

201
00:11:49,521 --> 00:11:53,620
I'm embarrassed to say I was doing
coke because coke is so douchey.

202
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,950
It's the ax Cologne of drugs,
you know? Yeah. And, and,

203
00:11:58,951 --> 00:12:03,220
and it was like four 35 in the morning,
maybe even earlier. It was earlier,

204
00:12:03,221 --> 00:12:07,770
because what we, uh, what we had done, it
had all the windows at the Ding Ho, uh,

205
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:11,040
cardboard boxes. So people sort of
light couldn't come in. And, well,

206
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:16,090
it's just like all these comics drinking
and partying and it's like the door

207
00:12:16,211 --> 00:12:20,970
swings open and home. Was it? What
time? We mean when the day, yeah,

208
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:23,680
it was like morning because
when the door swung open,

209
00:12:23,681 --> 00:12:28,681
all this sunlight poured in and these
cops like backlit fill the door and I'm

210
00:12:29,471 --> 00:12:34,330
like, wow, I'm going to jail. And
then the cops were like, Lenny, Lenny,

211
00:12:34,331 --> 00:12:38,610
you fucking prick. How are you friends?

212
00:12:38,611 --> 00:12:43,611
And then I just sat down and started
drinking and partying with us and I was

213
00:12:43,991 --> 00:12:48,250
like, 18 years old ago, I'm going to
jail. Oh, this is my scene and blow.

214
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:51,070
This is the best scene
ever. You know, it's funny,

215
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:55,050
when I was in below the night before,
I had some sort of cold and I,

216
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,920
and I couldn't feel my
nose and I was like, oh,

217
00:12:56,921 --> 00:12:59,650
this is what it was like to do
coke, you know, I, I, you know,

218
00:12:59,651 --> 00:13:03,900
so I ad libbed the line in this movie,
what was the wig budget on this moment?

219
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:08,650
I ad libbed Lyda, I
can't feel my face, which

220
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:13,810
it was. Uh, it's very 50.

221
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:20,210
Fuck me. Running 160. Jesus Christ,

222
00:13:20,211 --> 00:13:23,680
the 170, 180, a hundred,

223
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:29,200
187.
Where did you get this stuff?

224
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:37,630
Oh, uh, oh. Do you mind if I do online?

225
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:40,390
Fuck it.
Let's all do one.

226
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:53,360
She mentioned doing coke with p.
It was a,

227
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:58,520
we're doing baby laxative here. Oh
really? Yeah. I just shit a lot, Derek.

228
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:01,320
I Shat a willow tree.
Uh,

229
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:06,560
what am I supposed to do with all
this solid Jesus Christ. George,

230
00:14:06,561 --> 00:14:10,310
I don't see you in two years and you show
up at my fucking door with 110 pounds

231
00:14:10,311 --> 00:14:14,570
a blow. Just fucking sell
it. They're all right.

232
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:16,610
But it's going to take me a year.

233
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:22,730
I can't feel my face.
I mean I can touch it,

234
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:24,350
feel it inside.

235
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:30,960
So that's the scene. I actually, uh,

236
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:34,290
you know, uh, w when I say,
where did you get this? Uh,

237
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:38,620
Johnny Depp actually hadn't lived a
funny line. He goes, my dentist. But

238
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:43,060
it was funny cause he's turns
out he's a very funny guy.

239
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:46,690
But I did say this when I was filming
that scene and it became in my standup,

240
00:14:46,691 --> 00:14:49,630
I hate to be corny and do a story
from my standard, but it is true.

241
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:54,920
I didn't really know those guys
at well at all. And uh, I go,

242
00:14:54,921 --> 00:14:57,350
is anybody in this scene not on probation?

243
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:02,300
And Johnny Depp's like what did you do?
I go, I said, the tonight show I'm fired.

244
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:05,240
He's like, yeah, why did you do that?
I go, I dunno, I thought it was funny.

245
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:10,250
And then I'm like, you smashed it,
that hotel. He goes, yeah, I go,

246
00:15:10,251 --> 00:15:13,580
were you drunk? And Johnny Depp
is funny. He goes, in my defense,

247
00:15:13,581 --> 00:15:15,200
the hotel room made the first move

248
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:19,580
and this is a true story cause then I
look over at Paul Reubens and he's just

249
00:15:19,581 --> 00:15:22,870
trying to ignore the conversation.
It wasn't like, hey yeah, I rubbed

250
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:28,190
weird rock and roll thing.
The trash, the hotel room,

251
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:32,810
have accountants pay for it all.
But I've always felt like

252
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:36,460
during, there was a period where I was
trashing television shows, you know,

253
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:40,900
and it was just, I had the same kind of
frustration and rage and I thought, well,

254
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:45,340
if I do it at a Holiday Inn, you know,
big deal. Why don't I do it on a TV show?

255
00:15:45,341 --> 00:15:47,160
That's kind of funny at least.
Yeah,

256
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:48,650
I know.
That makes no sense.

257
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:54,250
Look at me like that RCA victor
dog just then staring at me.

258
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,890
I'm going to kind of see your
point, but I don't, I mean,

259
00:15:57,891 --> 00:16:01,040
I don't see the point of doing hotel
rooms. I've never understood it.

260
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:05,330
Just smashing shit and like, what are
you doing? That's just out of boredom.

261
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:08,890
But I'm the rule, but it's so
stupid to me. Just so childish.

262
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:13,360
Me, I couldn't do that because I'd be
afraid of waking up people next door.

263
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:14,703
I'm serious.

264
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:19,480
Like I have no problems sending the
tonight still on fire or or, yeah.

265
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:22,270
Or smashing up the ice Sidney hall show.
But the idea of,

266
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:25,940
I don't want to put somebody else out.
You smashed Arsenio Hall shows too.

267
00:16:25,941 --> 00:16:30,010
What did you do there? Yeah. Way crazier
than the tonight show. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

268
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:33,330
Cause he got fired,
you know, because of a,

269
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:37,390
they put Chevy Chase on and
70 markets in front of them.

270
00:16:37,391 --> 00:16:42,040
So paramount kind of fucked him over.
So I went out and I said,

271
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:45,820
are you really quitting? It was like the
week or two before. And he goes, yeah.

272
00:16:45,821 --> 00:16:48,370
And I go, well let's not make
it easy on them, you know.

273
00:16:48,371 --> 00:16:51,490
So I spray painted paramount
sucks on the backdrop.

274
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:54,940
And then I,
uh,

275
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:59,020
I started throwing the couches into the
audience and the crowd was going crazy.

276
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:03,070
Oh. And then I remember I
took a television set and
monitor and just threw it and

277
00:17:03,071 --> 00:17:07,690
then put my, uh, put my work boots
through the back of it. She's crying.

278
00:17:07,691 --> 00:17:10,600
She's way more expensive than anything
I did on the tonight show. But yeah.

279
00:17:10,601 --> 00:17:13,570
So then they,
they like tell Arsenio like get him.

280
00:17:13,571 --> 00:17:16,510
And so he wrestles me down and as
he's got me on the ground, he goes,

281
00:17:16,511 --> 00:17:17,344
thank you man.

282
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:22,110
Well cause it,
cause it was such a colossal

283
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:24,640
fuck you. And then like,
you know, a week later,

284
00:17:24,641 --> 00:17:28,220
Jay had booked me on the tonight
show, you know, which end,

285
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:30,580
he came in the dressing room
and he's like, you know, don't,

286
00:17:30,581 --> 00:17:33,550
don't smash up to more
stuff. You know, cause,

287
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:37,300
cause they were hoping and
I'd do something fucked up.
Now I'm not blaming them.

288
00:17:37,301 --> 00:17:38,134
I mean I wasn't,

289
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:41,660
that was a bit of the green light.
Oh

290
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:45,660
yeah. I mean I knew that I was on there
to do something screwy, but, but uh,

291
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:49,830
you know, what made it arson
was that I actually had the, uh,

292
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:54,600
this uh, lighter, a barbecue, lighter
taped to my wrist. Like I was like,

293
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:57,120
that's what made it arson.
Yeah.

294
00:17:57,121 --> 00:18:00,750
Because it meant that it was a
predetermined yeah, exactly. Yeah.

295
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:05,610
It was like a taxi driver.
Do you didn't worry about doing,

296
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:09,230
we worried we did that nobody was on fire.
I mean,

297
00:18:09,231 --> 00:18:12,180
cause I knew it burden clean
and the lighter fluid and stuff.

298
00:18:12,181 --> 00:18:14,340
And then I also had a
buddy, I said, you know,

299
00:18:14,341 --> 00:18:18,630
stand next to this fire extinguisher if
it gets out of control. But, but you know,

300
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:20,780
uh, I, I don't mean that.

301
00:18:20,781 --> 00:18:23,840
Make this my hook cause I've talked
about it on other podcasts but,

302
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:28,950
but I guess it's good to clean, clear
the air, you know? But um, I don't know.

303
00:18:28,951 --> 00:18:30,840
People think like I was
banned from the tonight show,

304
00:18:30,841 --> 00:18:33,870
but they had me on immediately right
after. And it was, it was weird.

305
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:38,240
What was weird was see is a lot bigger
than I always try to make Aiga. That's it.

306
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,990
The little fire.
Jesus Christ.

307
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,600
Well that's cause I'm squirting
lighter fluid right there.

308
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:47,540
Why? Why, why did you do that?

309
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:54,010
I love that I show to get ready and
this is like speechless twice now.

310
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:59,860
He just looking at why,
I mean I can,

311
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:03,870
I guess you were pissed off, but I mean,
I guess you know what it is. You're,

312
00:19:03,871 --> 00:19:07,410
you're, you're, you're, um, I don't know.

313
00:19:07,411 --> 00:19:11,160
I mean I think maybe you're too hippie.
You know what I mean? I think it's funny.

314
00:19:11,161 --> 00:19:15,420
You know, you're the mixed martial
artists guy and I've got more rage,

315
00:19:15,421 --> 00:19:19,230
which is really weird. Oh, it's
probably just because I exercise.

316
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:22,610
So you get it all out,
get it all out physically so you don't,

317
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,740
what about laying on stage?
Do you ever snap?

318
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:29,820
Very rarely. I mean, if I do,
I, it's for fun and I don't,

319
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:34,950
you know what I mean?
Like No. It's like, oh,

320
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:37,550
that's like part of what
you know to shut someone up.

321
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:41,330
You have to get into a rage.
But am I actually enraged? No,

322
00:19:41,331 --> 00:19:44,430
I'm just doing what I have to do
to keep the show rolling. Yeah.

323
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:48,920
Well I got to feel more pity for people
like that than anything at this point.

324
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:53,620
But like a heckler, hecklers, just
anyone who just completely over,

325
00:19:53,621 --> 00:19:56,660
over anxious to get attention.
Just obnoxious.

326
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:58,640
Moronica I feel bad for them.

327
00:19:58,641 --> 00:20:03,641
I feel bad that that people are at that
stage in their life where they're just

328
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:08,060
so fucking stupid. They want to yell out
in the middle of his show and interrupt.

329
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:08,870
What about winning?

330
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:12,860
It's like when, when look,
when they do that and they,

331
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:17,260
and they make it so you can't do your ad,
then you have to go after though. Right.

332
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:22,010
I try not to be actually angry though.
Yeah. If that makes any sense. You know,

333
00:20:22,011 --> 00:20:24,980
I understand. It's like what I was saying
like that rage, it's like a switch.

334
00:20:24,981 --> 00:20:28,430
It's like a, it's like a tool
that I have that I'm not proud of,

335
00:20:28,431 --> 00:20:32,090
but unfortunately it doesn't
really boil up in my real life.

336
00:20:32,091 --> 00:20:36,560
I do think people think that might be
out of control and the rest of my life,

337
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:41,300
I don't think I am. Why do you
like what? You seem very friendly.

338
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:46,270
I don't, I don't think of you as a guy
that would be like filled with rage.

339
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,370
I think of you,
it was a guy who

340
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:53,640
probably would have rage if you felt like
someone was fucking with you. Yeah. And,

341
00:20:53,641 --> 00:20:55,810
and, and it's Corny and played out. And I,

342
00:20:55,811 --> 00:20:59,770
I really don't have any
patients for bullying, which,

343
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:03,010
which I hate that term now.
Like people use it. It's so, uh,

344
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:07,240
it doesn't mean the same thing, but,
but yeah, I don't, I don't like bullies,

345
00:21:07,241 --> 00:21:09,730
bullies, uh, ever since I
was a little boy, you know,

346
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:14,920
but if you think that the
world should be a adjust place,

347
00:21:14,921 --> 00:21:19,920
you do spin out a lot, you know?
I mean, so I mean, you know, I,

348
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:22,240
I dunno,
I think and I don't actually,

349
00:21:22,241 --> 00:21:26,580
I'm not helping my case cause we talked
a little bit about my new movie a,

350
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:31,460
if people see that they think
I'm angry too, you know,
it's okay. So spoiler alert,

351
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:34,150
maybe a baby does get shot
in the first two minutes.

352
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:38,580
Oh look,
it's not a real break of view.

353
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:44,260
Joe Ever seen a baby gets shot.

354
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:48,820
Whoa. That isn't, well in my defense
that baby wasn't asshole. No,

355
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:51,960
it was a baby. It's a, oh
well there's the jailer,

356
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:55,840
but I think someone's posted the jeep
of the baby getting shot. Holtzman,

357
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:57,800
no standup comic.

358
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,900
He's one of these guys that is
probably one of the funniest guys ever.

359
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:05,290
But for whatever reason he can never get
it together enough to write like career

360
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:08,860
and stand up.
When Susan Smith drown her kids,

361
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:12,790
he came into the comedy store and he goes,
I heard those were bad kids. He goes,

362
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:15,910
I heard they sat that close
to the television than
ever put away their blocks.

363
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:20,350
They're constantly spilling those milk.
The kids will not be missed. It was,

364
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:25,630
everybody was like Holy Shit. And if
you see him as kids, like he's like,

365
00:22:25,631 --> 00:22:29,230
it's really big and tense guy with
the slicked back hair and you know,

366
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:30,400
he stands right in front of them.

367
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:33,630
It was one of the funniest fucking
things I ever saw. Anybody say no.

368
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:37,180
Do you think he means that?
No. No. Yeah, character.

369
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:41,110
Cause Cause I've done that where I've
gone over the line and I've said things

370
00:22:41,111 --> 00:22:42,370
that I don't believe in.

371
00:22:42,371 --> 00:22:47,060
It made me feel bad later I
opened for Nirvana and uh,

372
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:51,640
and I know comics are always like, oh,
you know, getting heckled and stuff,

373
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:54,370
you know.
I mean I got hit with teenagers.

374
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:59,400
They would successfully throw people
from the pit and hit me and I had

375
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:04,030
[inaudible] going off around me and
I get hit with bibles a lot too,

376
00:23:04,031 --> 00:23:07,930
which was weird. Whoa. Wow.
Yeah. And so boots and stuff.

377
00:23:07,931 --> 00:23:11,440
So I learned like I learned like the
Serpentine, you know what I mean?

378
00:23:11,441 --> 00:23:15,190
I would just go back. How many times did
you open for that? I did, I think like 16,

379
00:23:15,191 --> 00:23:20,170
17 shows and every once in a while he
would go, okay. Which was weird, you know,

380
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:24,070
but I was more comfortable
when it was horrible.

381
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:26,860
I know that sounds weird,
but that was my,

382
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:30,250
that felt right to do.
You know what I mean?

383
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:34,210
He deserved no, I just thought
it was kind of funny. You know,

384
00:23:34,211 --> 00:23:37,960
like when you get laughs,
that means the crowd likes you.

385
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:42,520
When you get like rage, that means
you have all of their attention.

386
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:45,860
Do you know what I mean? Like Robin
Williams is my good friend and Robin,

387
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:46,731
you know,

388
00:23:46,731 --> 00:23:51,050
he goes on stage and people love him and
then I would go on after him when we do

389
00:23:51,051 --> 00:23:54,050
sets and, and, and, and in a weird way,

390
00:23:54,051 --> 00:23:58,220
it meant more for me for people to go,
oh, Robin Williams showed up last night.

391
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,820
Yeah. And then Bobcat Goldthwait
was there. Do you know
what that fucking asshole,

392
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:06,260
and a weird way that meant more to me,
you know,

393
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:10,640
his form of neuroses is way
more lucrative. You know, my,

394
00:24:10,641 --> 00:24:14,570
I'm telling people to fuck off isn't
as lucrative, but uh, but yeah,

395
00:24:14,571 --> 00:24:18,320
so it was opening for Nirvana in Chicago
and Michael Jordan every tired from

396
00:24:18,321 --> 00:24:22,280
basketball. And I went,
Hey Chicago, by the way,

397
00:24:22,281 --> 00:24:25,910
they hated me to begin with, but I go,
Hey Chicago, I feel bad, but you know,

398
00:24:25,911 --> 00:24:29,840
for $40 million a year, I'd shoot my
own dad in the fucking head, you know?

399
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:38,420
And there was a noise that wasn't
even like a Bu. It was just like,

400
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:42,920
fuck you.
I wish I had that sample.

401
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,490
It was the best.
And

402
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:51,950
what did you think at that moment when you
heard that? It was funny, you know, but,

403
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:55,610
but I did, you know, I don't have a beef
with Michael Jordan. I felt bad. I mean,

404
00:24:55,611 --> 00:24:56,151
even though,

405
00:24:56,151 --> 00:24:59,000
cause people just because they're super
famous doesn't mean they're still not

406
00:24:59,001 --> 00:25:02,450
human. So I did, I go, why'd I do that?
But you know, so he had to live in,

407
00:25:02,451 --> 00:25:07,160
you learn it's baby steps, but the
only person laughing that night really,

408
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:09,590
I remember walking by Kirby
on the amp and he goes,

409
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:14,570
I can't believe you said
that. But yeah, I had uh, met,

410
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:17,540
uh, Nirvana. I met Kurt before they broke.

411
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,540
He was a fan of mine and
wanted to interview me.

412
00:25:20,541 --> 00:25:23,390
So he interviewed me at a
college radio station in Anarbor.

413
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,540
I know that blows people's mind.

414
00:25:25,541 --> 00:25:29,660
It's like finding out that like a Jimmy
Hendricks really loved Buddy Hackett or

415
00:25:29,661 --> 00:25:33,170
something. But uh, yeah, he did.

416
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,170
I love that.
Talking Duck Moose.

417
00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:44,450
It blew my mind. Wow. That's
pretty fucking cool. Yeah.

418
00:25:44,451 --> 00:25:46,160
So I toured in the open forum.

419
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:50,400
I repelled in nude from the roof of the
Oakland Coliseum on new years when the,

420
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:55,130
with them cause they were playing
there. And uh, and uh, yeah.

421
00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:59,110
Are you called, did you meet Courtney?
Where you around Courtney a little bit,

422
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:02,690
yeah. You see their relationship?
Yeah, I mean the, what I saw actually,

423
00:26:02,691 --> 00:26:06,860
I don't have any, uh, any good dirt for
people. They seem to like each other.

424
00:26:06,861 --> 00:26:11,750
I'm not, you know, I, I, uh, I,
you know, I think people, you know,

425
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:12,830
I,
you know,

426
00:26:12,831 --> 00:26:16,340
people get involved in all this crazy
conspiracy stuff and all that stuff.

427
00:26:16,341 --> 00:26:18,170
I think what happens with some things,

428
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,750
and I know where I am when I'm
talking about crazy conspiracy,

429
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:25,990
but sometimes I think like huge tragedies
happen and people can't justify them,

430
00:26:26,391 --> 00:26:29,990
so they have to make up some other thing.
You know what I'm saying?

431
00:26:29,991 --> 00:26:34,640
I think sometimes it's, it's,
it's just, um, you know,

432
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:39,390
I, I, you know, Kurt was a really
sweet guy, but he certainly was a,

433
00:26:39,391 --> 00:26:42,260
a manic depressive. And I
almost think like, again,

434
00:26:42,261 --> 00:26:45,050
when we were talking about earlier,
people are talking about drugs, it's like,

435
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:49,070
like that killed them. It's
like, well, that didn't really
kill him. You know, he, he,

436
00:26:49,071 --> 00:26:51,670
he had some in his system when
he died, but he, he, he, he,

437
00:26:51,671 --> 00:26:54,420
he'd cleaned up enough to commit suicide.
You know,

438
00:26:54,421 --> 00:26:56,600
there's some people that
are chemical imbalances.

439
00:26:56,610 --> 00:26:58,380
There's some people that
are prone to suicide.

440
00:26:58,381 --> 00:27:02,010
And I think blaming drugs is
really lazy, you know? Well,

441
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:05,040
certainly upsets the balance though,
right? I mean, I swear to God,

442
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:08,040
I'm 30 years sober and I'm
saying this, but, but you know,

443
00:27:08,041 --> 00:27:12,960
I think it's just easy to blame drugs.
Oh, well yeah, I see what you're saying.

444
00:27:12,961 --> 00:27:15,660
I mean it's, it's a personal
choice, right? I mean,

445
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:19,890
to get to get addicted in the first place.
Yeah. But I don't think all addictions,

446
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:25,020
I think with think heroin kills.
I think running out of heroin kills.

447
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:31,580
So what does heroin, you know,
not good, but whatever. Well,

448
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:35,250
I look, the only time I've been
high, high in the past 30 years,

449
00:27:35,251 --> 00:27:39,180
I had back surgery and I was on
dilaudid and uh, I'll tell you what, uh,

450
00:27:39,181 --> 00:27:43,050
I certainly didn't have any suicidal
thoughts that fucking week and a half.

451
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:48,560
That was beautiful.
I'm not gonna lie,

452
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:50,690
it's essentially like an
opium lucky experience.

453
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:54,860
My wife came home and I was
crying watching lifetime.

454
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:57,080
This is the story

455
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:06,450
and watching a lifetime show marquis post
is still going to take away your son.

456
00:28:07,191 --> 00:28:10,730
And
my wife goes,

457
00:28:10,731 --> 00:28:15,300
you don't get any more.
I was just crying.

458
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:19,370
That sounds awesome.
That would've been great to videotape

459
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:24,760
people like those fucking pills, man.
Is that what I see going on July?

460
00:28:24,761 --> 00:28:27,210
Cause at the same thing. I
don't know. I never done it,

461
00:28:27,211 --> 00:28:32,100
but I'm assuming it is opiates.
Yeah. Scared of that shit.

462
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:36,450
Yeah, it's bad times, man. Because
it's the, it's the, it's the,

463
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:40,980
the need and the getting off of
them, which are horrible. I've heard,

464
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:45,900
I don't know why we're talking so much
about drugs today, but it's all right.

465
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:47,041
Do you have any,

466
00:28:47,041 --> 00:28:50,880
did you document your time with Nirvana
at all with curt or anything like that

467
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:55,740
at that time? New. Did you have like an
video cam and you kept around? I have a,

468
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:59,730
I have,
I have seen a photo of me nude behind him,

469
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,000
stage with the,

470
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:07,040
I have the in Nutro wings on and I'm
naked with a repelling little thing and

471
00:29:08,081 --> 00:29:10,930
then I love them back. And I
also have a hat on. I like that.

472
00:29:10,931 --> 00:29:15,580
I don't mind people seeing my dick when
my love handles, but not my balding pate,

473
00:29:15,610 --> 00:29:19,480
you know? So I've got
a hat. I will say this,

474
00:29:19,481 --> 00:29:22,630
if you're a comedian or perform and
you're going to be nude publicly,

475
00:29:22,631 --> 00:29:27,340
give it a tug. You'll, you'll thank
me later cause uh, yeah, it was cold.

476
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:32,890
I really wish I did pull my Dick. How
many photos are there of that out there?

477
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:37,090
Surprising. Not a ton.
You know, this was, uh,

478
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,060
was in the mid nineties,
I guessing. Right.

479
00:29:39,061 --> 00:29:43,450
Did they have even have digital though
now? It would have been everybody's phone.

480
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:46,510
Yeah. But still, I mean it wasn't
hot. It was just weird, you know,

481
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:50,380
there was so much ma'am going on stage
too, by the way, cause it was midnight,

482
00:29:50,381 --> 00:29:53,290
you know, fireworks were going
off. It was just like, oh yeah.

483
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:56,740
And there's Bob Scratch Goldfarb
nude walking around like a chair.

484
00:29:57,910 --> 00:30:01,000
I was, we were going to,
the way that it was set up,

485
00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:03,820
it was men, you know, New Year's.

486
00:30:03,821 --> 00:30:06,580
So they wanted to do an extra
thing where there's explosions.

487
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:11,230
And I remember saying, the curt, I said,
you know, you know, I go, fuck you man.

488
00:30:11,231 --> 00:30:15,790
I'm tired of being your scatter. That was
Elvis's chimp, you know, fuck you man.

489
00:30:15,791 --> 00:30:18,790
I don't want to cheer you up, you know,
go called Pauly shore's something.

490
00:30:18,791 --> 00:30:22,030
You know. So, uh, when we,

491
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:26,050
when we set up the thing about me
repelling, the guy took a cult,

492
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:29,140
the stage manager took cold cuts
and he built the stage out of the,

493
00:30:29,141 --> 00:30:32,310
out of the food tray in the back. And
he's like, okay, here's what Chris's,

494
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:36,820
here's Dave years curtain and Bob's
going to repel in nude in these m and m's

495
00:30:36,821 --> 00:30:41,680
are where the explosives
are. It's so, and so, um, I,

496
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:45,190
it's still, they go, Kurt will count,
we'll tell you when it's midnight,

497
00:30:45,191 --> 00:30:49,900
you count back from 10 or whatever,
you know. [inaudible] okay, so,

498
00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:52,150
so, uh, it's midnight and they
give them the sing though.

499
00:30:52,151 --> 00:30:56,500
And he looks up and I'm holding my
own weight, like rappelling down,

500
00:30:56,501 --> 00:30:59,650
but I stopped, you know, so he can
count. And so I'm giving them the Brown.

501
00:30:59,651 --> 00:31:03,670
I basically, from 150 feet up,
he goes, he looks up and he goes,

502
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:07,120
Hey, Oakland, you want
to hear a drum solo?

503
00:31:09,010 --> 00:31:12,070
And so I'm barely control my own way.

504
00:31:12,071 --> 00:31:15,610
And then finally he just goes one.
And I,

505
00:31:15,611 --> 00:31:17,380
and I shot down really fast.

506
00:31:17,381 --> 00:31:21,610
I had rope burns on my ass and stuff
and I landed right behind him, Bam.

507
00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:25,090
And then, uh, I came down so
fast, he actually didn't see
it. And then you're like,

508
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:27,970
he looks up and he's like Paulie,
Paulie.

509
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:33,550
So until then I ducked behind this amp
looking for a cover because there's

510
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:37,600
supposed to be, my closers was to be there
with someone had taken him as a joke,

511
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:40,630
you know? And so I just kind of had
to stand in the middle of the stage,

512
00:31:40,631 --> 00:31:43,720
cause everywhere there was bombs
going off, I learned those.

513
00:31:43,721 --> 00:31:45,970
If you're nude at midnight,
you don't get a kiss.

514
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,600
Like everywhere I went people were like,
Whoa,

515
00:31:49,601 --> 00:31:54,040
nude guy walking around a little weird.
So yeah.

516
00:31:54,041 --> 00:31:58,720
So again, all this was in
sobriety. That's hilarious.

517
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:03,010
No one would have assumed I would always,
I always thought you definitely were a,

518
00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:07,630
I lose a weed guy. Know
what it is, is like,

519
00:32:07,631 --> 00:32:12,580
often I see something and I go, well
this, this is never going to happen again.

520
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:16,990
So I got to a Carpe Diem, man. You know, I
gotta I gotta seize the moment. You know,

521
00:32:16,991 --> 00:32:21,100
when things align. Yeah. Collide
the couch on the couch up fight.

522
00:32:21,130 --> 00:32:23,080
You got to dry Hump Michael Bolton.
I'm like,

523
00:32:23,081 --> 00:32:26,440
once I was it dry humped
Weigel bolts. Yeah, he was,

524
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:31,800
he was singing and it was this benefit
and he was the headliner and yeah.

525
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:34,570
And uh, and so I just see
him and I'm like, well,

526
00:32:34,571 --> 00:32:37,210
I'm never going to have this kind
of access to Michael Bolton again.

527
00:32:37,211 --> 00:32:40,970
So I walk out behind him
and now just grab him.

528
00:32:40,971 --> 00:32:43,850
I just started dry humping
him and his crew tackled me,

529
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:46,760
drag me off stage and the guy's like,
what the fuck?

530
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:51,650
[inaudible]

531
00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:56,450
I'm Michael, I'm sorry this is me,
no softball tomorrow. And he's like,

532
00:32:56,451 --> 00:32:57,770
just get out of here man.

533
00:32:57,771 --> 00:33:01,940
So I walked and ran actually around the
whole auditorium and came up through the

534
00:33:01,941 --> 00:33:05,370
other side and I started booking out
again. But I got tackled that down.

535
00:33:05,371 --> 00:33:07,640
I didn't make it to him. I got like,
I didn't even get packed again.

536
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:10,850
Pass the kick drum. Did
they hurt you? No, no, no.

537
00:33:10,851 --> 00:33:14,240
Cause they're used to grab and you know,
Chubby Catholic women and tackling them.

538
00:33:14,241 --> 00:33:16,640
You know, not like, you know, that's the,

539
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:19,040
that's the threat at a
Michael Bolton concert.

540
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:22,460
Well you would think though that security
would want to kick your ass for doing

541
00:33:22,461 --> 00:33:26,210
something like that, but it was his
security. So they wear kid gloves.

542
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:31,040
How bad ass as Michael Bolton security.
I don't know if that,

543
00:33:31,041 --> 00:33:35,780
like chicks would go crazy for that game.
Bow and arrows know that for real man,

544
00:33:35,781 --> 00:33:39,500
he called, we had a really hard time
keeping crazy chicks away from here.

545
00:33:39,610 --> 00:33:43,810
It's better. It's not like the stones
at Oakmont hiring hell's angels.

546
00:33:43,850 --> 00:33:47,600
The kickass.
Some of those clerical workers,

547
00:33:47,601 --> 00:33:52,220
they're going to give us a lot of strife
today. Guys. Clerical workers. Yeah.

548
00:33:52,221 --> 00:33:57,221
He represents like he's this singing
version of those really great looking good

549
00:33:57,981 --> 00:34:02,360
guys that are like paintings on the cover
of those really stupid romance romance

550
00:34:02,361 --> 00:34:07,220
now flowing long fiber.
Exactly. The Fabio Kinda guy.

551
00:34:07,930 --> 00:34:12,770
A woman. It's a man, woman hybrid
thing. You know the long hair like that.

552
00:34:12,770 --> 00:34:14,960
I mean, you see what
they're doing. I mean, why,

553
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:19,970
what men do you know that have like
open chested shirts and they have long

554
00:34:20,031 --> 00:34:23,960
flowing hair? Like, oh that,
that's a ridiculous you're
yet, that's partly a woman.

555
00:34:24,370 --> 00:34:25,790
They,
that's what they're looking for.

556
00:34:25,791 --> 00:34:29,570
They're looking for some weird
amalgamation of man and woman.

557
00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:33,650
Uber Romantic that doesn't
exist in an actual man.

558
00:34:33,651 --> 00:34:37,120
Is that Guy gonna have sex with a woman.
You know what I'm saying?

559
00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:42,230
Once she wants it on her terms, it's
not like a pirate. It's just like, no,

560
00:34:42,231 --> 00:34:45,890
no, no. He's super romantic
lives only for her. See,

561
00:34:45,970 --> 00:34:48,770
this is why this twilight thing worked.

562
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:54,010
The women founded to be a romance film.
I mean it really wasn't a vampire movie.

563
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:56,580
Well, and I mean that's the
American idol thing. It's,

564
00:34:56,581 --> 00:34:59,990
it's guys who are non threatening
to old ladies and young girls.

565
00:34:59,991 --> 00:35:03,420
But I think when a woman grows up, she
wants to get laid, she wants to get fuck,

566
00:35:03,421 --> 00:35:04,254
she doesn't want

567
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:05,530
some do.

568
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:10,560
And they retained the need for
intense amounts of romance in,

569
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:15,700
in almost fictional form.
And that's where it bounces out in these,

570
00:35:15,701 --> 00:35:19,670
these twilight to sort of things where
we don't understand it. And we'd go,

571
00:35:19,671 --> 00:35:21,010
what the fuck is going on?

572
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:24,580
And yet you're seeing flocks of
women lining up to buy these books.

573
00:35:24,581 --> 00:35:29,220
But I find that those women are
really arrested. I, I find them. Yeah,

574
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:30,030
they're very

575
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:32,710
did. They're very immature.
You know what I mean? I know in

576
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:37,200
a certain way or that's just what
they like and they indulge it. Yeah.

577
00:35:37,201 --> 00:35:40,920
But do you think he's older women
that are like that? I don't know.

578
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:45,760
I would assume, I would assume
there's probably some, I dunno.

579
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:48,750
I'd like to, I want to know the,
uh, the ages on that. So you will,

580
00:35:48,751 --> 00:35:51,090
you're thinking is that as
they get wiser and older,

581
00:35:51,091 --> 00:35:52,620
that seems more and more ridiculous.

582
00:35:52,621 --> 00:35:57,360
And they said the idea of running off
and with some pirate and [inaudible] sexy

583
00:35:57,361 --> 00:36:00,930
hair, I don't think it's that they
really want to do that. You know?

584
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:04,170
I don't think it's like they would
really run off with the vampire.

585
00:36:04,171 --> 00:36:07,830
They love reading the story about the
woman who runs off with the vampire.

586
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:11,800
She's the one for him.
I don't know anything about the twice

587
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:17,400
a Mormon version of the thing.
The woman who was a Mormon,

588
00:36:17,401 --> 00:36:21,330
so she didn't even know too much
about the vampire culture, I believe.

589
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:26,220
Yeah. Well she made up a bunch of shit.
Like they can even be in the sunlight.

590
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:30,860
It just sparkle. Well, what the
fuck is he supposed to dial in?

591
00:36:30,861 --> 00:36:34,800
A real band fire? Fheg
that's big. That's bullshit.

592
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:38,100
It burst into flames. Let
you see blade what? Fix me.

593
00:36:38,101 --> 00:36:43,080
More of a nerd that I'm upset that they're
like, that is so bullshit. Vampires.

594
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:48,110
I got upset a blade because they got away
with the something with sunscreen and

595
00:36:48,281 --> 00:36:52,580
I'm like, that is fucking,
that's his laziest fuck bullshit.

596
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:58,430
Bullshit. You can't fucking wear sunscreen
bitch. I'm calling bullshit on blame.

597
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:03,270
100% bullshit again. Yeah, I
guess that's a sensitive empire,

598
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:06,150
but that's at least better to me.
I'll,

599
00:37:06,210 --> 00:37:09,390
I'll take the sunscreen over.
They sparkle.

600
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:12,760
Like you can't just reinvent the vampire.
You can't guess

601
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:17,650
Ken. I mean, but no, that's ridiculous.
But I mean there's, you know,

602
00:37:17,651 --> 00:37:21,810
I mean, what universe do they really
exist in anyways? You know, I, uh,

603
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:24,960
I would not know anything
about what would make a loop

604
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:26,990
creative story.
I think they should just,

605
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:32,550
I don't think you understand. My movies
makes the cloud and I fucking loved it.

606
00:37:32,551 --> 00:37:36,670
And I movies make hundreds of dollars.
So I've use the

607
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:39,640
cloud. And then I did a movie
called Windy city heat that,

608
00:37:39,730 --> 00:37:40,780
that one I didn't write,

609
00:37:40,781 --> 00:37:44,590
but that's when I directed and kind
of help put all the pieces together.

610
00:37:45,610 --> 00:37:50,140
John Barrett, I still haven't watched
that. And then there's the heart.

611
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:54,850
World's greatest dad is a movie
I did with Robin Williams. No,

612
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:59,170
I didn't see worlds groups there. And
he's staring shakes the clown, the clown.

613
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:02,800
Well,
these movies shakes is a fucked up movie.

614
00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:06,370
That's a very angry movie.
And every once in a while, uh,

615
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:09,550
like Tom Kenny and I went to a screening,
Tom Candy plays binky.

616
00:38:09,551 --> 00:38:12,160
The evil clown is now
the voices spongebob.

617
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:17,710
So I always think Nickelodeon probably,
it doesn't really ever quickly drill.

618
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:19,690
I'm sure Nickelodeon,
hey,

619
00:38:19,691 --> 00:38:24,280
you know the guy who's doing
coke and killing people with
Ra? Juggling pins. Yeah,

620
00:38:24,281 --> 00:38:29,090
that's our, that's our,
that's our cornerstone. Yeah.

621
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,930
So Spongebob, I, no, Tom Kenny
since I was six years old, but,

622
00:38:31,931 --> 00:38:34,620
so Tommy was a binky decline.

623
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:37,900
He and I watching shakes at this thing
and it was just packed with people and

624
00:38:37,901 --> 00:38:39,610
they're just as the
characters and they were,

625
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:41,830
there was clown whores
there and everything.

626
00:38:41,831 --> 00:38:44,410
It was really strange and
people were really fucked up.

627
00:38:44,411 --> 00:38:47,470
And then the middle of a Tom
Kenny leans over to me, he goes,

628
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:50,800
what the fuck were we thinking?
And I'm like, I don't know man.

629
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:57,580
It was like that star trek sketch on SNL.
You know what I mean?

630
00:38:57,581 --> 00:39:01,510
Like these people were really passionate
about it and I'm like, get a life.

631
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,660
I didn't say that I was very nice to them,

632
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:08,770
but I was a junior in high school and
shakes the clown was the first, uh,

633
00:39:08,771 --> 00:39:11,830
independent move. I didn't know
what independent movies were.

634
00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:15,010
And that was the first movie that I
had to go to a different movie theater.

635
00:39:15,011 --> 00:39:16,690
Then I was used to,
you know,

636
00:39:16,691 --> 00:39:21,691
like off the AMC and I watched it and
it was my favorite movie in high school

637
00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:26,490
growing up. Uh, and uh, what,
what was weird about six to con?

638
00:39:27,010 --> 00:39:31,800
Have you ever gone back to like do
like a commentary commentary on it?

639
00:39:32,110 --> 00:39:35,820
Like to do that? I'd like to do
that and get everybody together. Uh,

640
00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:38,990
cause I mean there's a ton of comics
in that movie that just Robin,

641
00:39:38,991 --> 00:39:41,540
but there's like Adam Sandler and,
and uh,

642
00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:44,870
Blake Clark and I might do that,
like get it like a case

643
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:47,500
beer and get us all together
and do it as a podcast.

644
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:50,660
If you ever want to use a studio park
as you can always use desk garden.

645
00:39:50,770 --> 00:39:55,060
There we go. And then many people
would actually sink it up though.

646
00:39:55,130 --> 00:39:56,810
I think a lot of people we do,

647
00:39:56,840 --> 00:40:00,380
we do it a lot of times with like UFC fcs
and like TV shows and stuff like that.

648
00:40:00,381 --> 00:40:04,160
But I think I like a lot of these movies
would be great to just go back and

649
00:40:04,161 --> 00:40:07,760
revisit as some kind of, you
know, yeah. You know what,

650
00:40:07,761 --> 00:40:12,350
that would be a cool video to
release online of you doing that.

651
00:40:12,351 --> 00:40:14,760
And I bet it would really
pump up the DVD sales.

652
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:19,790
Well shakes. Uh, I don't have a
problem revisiting it. I tried,

653
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:24,470
I'm wondering if I remember many of
the stories. Uh, but I do remember it.

654
00:40:24,471 --> 00:40:29,270
I ended up on the today show with a
real clown debating the program. Yeah.

655
00:40:29,271 --> 00:40:32,660
Cause clowns are protesting it.
There were mad. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

656
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:36,950
So I just beat the guy before we go
on, I was like, what's your name?

657
00:40:36,951 --> 00:40:41,030
And he's like, I'm bamboozle. And I'm
like, no dude, what's your real name?

658
00:40:41,031 --> 00:40:45,760
He's like, I'm in my clown attire, so
call me by my clown name. Okay, bamboozle.

659
00:40:45,770 --> 00:40:47,660
I'm going to rip you a new
one when we get out there.

660
00:40:47,661 --> 00:40:51,230
So we get on TV and Katie Kirk says
this was her worst interview ever.

661
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:55,220
So we get on TV and she's
like going the clowns.

662
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:59,390
Like clowns do a lot of good for a lot
of good causes and bobcat's film portrays

663
00:40:59,391 --> 00:41:03,140
them in a negative like good. And
I go, nobody thinks you're funny.

664
00:41:03,141 --> 00:41:05,210
The only reason you perform and hospitals,

665
00:41:05,211 --> 00:41:08,960
because that's one place that kid can't
get up and run away from you. And then,

666
00:41:08,961 --> 00:41:12,740
uh, Katie Kirk's like, would you
please be serious? I was like, no,

667
00:41:12,741 --> 00:41:14,270
you're interviewing me in a clown.

668
00:41:15,450 --> 00:41:20,030
So would you please be serious about
this very important issue of cloud abuse,

669
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:22,160
clown clown abuse.

670
00:41:22,450 --> 00:41:26,780
So I liked the fact that my dad actually
was always like saying what did you do

671
00:41:26,781 --> 00:41:29,780
to kid Kirk? Cause she says you were
the worst interview like she had,

672
00:41:29,950 --> 00:41:32,100
he had her back. Matt Mine, that'd

673
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:34,010
be the worst interview.
That's the worst energy

674
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:34,843
you've ever had.

675
00:41:35,930 --> 00:41:38,780
And this is someone who at the time was
probably interviewing the backstreet

676
00:41:38,781 --> 00:41:39,560
boys and stuff.

677
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:43,480
But so me because I came out and character
was the worst thing she'd ever seen.

678
00:41:43,481 --> 00:41:44,750
The worst thing ever.

679
00:41:44,751 --> 00:41:48,860
He ruined my month mo because I answered
it was my birthday month I think.

680
00:41:48,890 --> 00:41:49,460
Cause I also,

681
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:53,330
she wasn't familiar with me and I think
I sacrad punchier cause I think she met

682
00:41:53,331 --> 00:41:57,560
me and I was like oh hi. And then I
came out and I was like Ah. Oh I see.

683
00:41:57,570 --> 00:41:58,430
Yeah.

684
00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:05,230
Cause she expecting you to have some
sort of a rational debate or she couldn't

685
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:08,900
switch gears. Yeah. As you were
in character can be wigged out.

686
00:42:08,901 --> 00:42:12,180
Like if I didn't know me and I met the
guy and then I come out and I'm like,

687
00:42:13,150 --> 00:42:16,220
how did you create that character?
Where did that come from?

688
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,510
I just never felt comfortable doing
traditional stand up, you know?

689
00:42:20,511 --> 00:42:25,220
So the idea of just doing this guy who
was, I wasn't comfortable on stage,

690
00:42:25,221 --> 00:42:27,600
so just to be nervous,
you know,

691
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:31,700
like my early standup would just be me
reading a dear John Letter and crying a

692
00:42:31,701 --> 00:42:35,880
real dear John Letter. And then cause
they'd go, Hey, please love them me back.

693
00:42:35,881 --> 00:42:39,740
Get Gold and you want
to hear jokes. You know,

694
00:42:39,741 --> 00:42:42,590
I'd be sobbing and it'd be
like two guys walk into a bar.

695
00:42:43,430 --> 00:42:47,780
I'd read the letter and it goes,
my wife was so fat, you know,

696
00:42:47,781 --> 00:42:52,100
how fed is she? I told you I don't even
have a girlfriend. You fucking listen.

697
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:55,040
You know, it wasn't, it wasn't stand of,

698
00:42:55,041 --> 00:42:57,740
it was just this real weird
thing I would do. And,

699
00:42:58,020 --> 00:43:02,330
and eventually people would start picking
on that character and then he would

700
00:43:02,331 --> 00:43:05,900
become, I would become more
angry and, and kind of defensive.

701
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:07,550
And it became crazier and crazier.

702
00:43:07,850 --> 00:43:11,060
But I also just didn't like the idea of
going out on stage and pretending I was

703
00:43:11,061 --> 00:43:13,310
me because, uh, all the comics,

704
00:43:13,311 --> 00:43:17,190
I always looked up to be at Groucho Marx
or Andy Kaufman or anyway, you know,

705
00:43:17,210 --> 00:43:19,160
they had a persona they hid behind,
you know,

706
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:23,010
and the idea for me just to go out in a
sweater and talk about dating seems so,

707
00:43:23,030 --> 00:43:26,180
it seems so foreign to me also.
I was so young too.

708
00:43:26,181 --> 00:43:27,680
So that was the other
reason why it was weird.

709
00:43:28,010 --> 00:43:31,550
What kind of a persona did Groucho Marx
of? Well, I mean, that's not Groucho,

710
00:43:31,551 --> 00:43:34,610
you know what I mean? That, that whole,
the cadence in his voice and all that,

711
00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:38,270
it painted on a mustache for God's sakes,
you know?

712
00:43:38,271 --> 00:43:41,320
But I think people are pain
than most of us really? Man,

713
00:43:41,870 --> 00:43:43,400
he was painting on his mustache.

714
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:50,153
Oh my God.

715
00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:55,580
Was that weird seeing you? Yeah, mostly.
Mostly because I sound like a dinosaur.

716
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:59,770
I thought it was going to need a
black guy who makes the funny night.

717
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:05,520
I didn't realize that joke is so old.

718
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:11,170
I actually still have to do that
joke when people introduce me.

719
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:16,770
I thought it was good to be the black
guy. That's funny. I think it's sad that,

720
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,580
you know,
Bubba Smith passed away and I get a call,

721
00:44:21,581 --> 00:44:26,530
the way I found out about it is I get a
call from the AP wire service and they

722
00:44:26,531 --> 00:44:30,010
go, Hey, do you have a common on Bubba
Smith passing away? And I was like, well,

723
00:44:30,011 --> 00:44:33,870
I didn't know he died.
And he had just died a few hours before.

724
00:44:35,070 --> 00:44:39,420
And uh, yeah, I have a quote. Um,
he was a really good guy who, uh,

725
00:44:39,450 --> 00:44:44,450
didn't take any bs and he was a lot
smarter than people realized and he told

726
00:44:44,641 --> 00:44:49,350
great stories. That's what I was saying.
But the whole time I'm thinking, man,

727
00:44:49,351 --> 00:44:52,570
when I die, I hope they don't
call fucking Gutenberg. You know,

728
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:58,200
I hope. I'm like, I didn't see Bubba
in 20 years. And they called me.

729
00:44:58,660 --> 00:44:59,493
Right.

730
00:44:59,830 --> 00:45:04,120
Did you see 'em Gutenberg
when something happened?

731
00:45:04,121 --> 00:45:07,630
There was when Phil Hartman
was, uh, killed Gutenberg,

732
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:12,740
like dressed up in like a suit and a tie
and went down to talk to the reporters

733
00:45:14,171 --> 00:45:18,550
and sort of represent celebrities
and to ask for privacy.

734
00:45:18,551 --> 00:45:21,040
It was one of the weirdest
fucking things I've ever seen.

735
00:45:21,370 --> 00:45:26,370
It was like he knew that cameras were
going to be there and he vaguely knew

736
00:45:26,411 --> 00:45:30,700
them, so he decided to represent the
situation. It was really strange.

737
00:45:30,790 --> 00:45:34,180
No, I'd never seen that. So he
goes out and he starts acting like

738
00:45:34,710 --> 00:45:38,820
sort of talking to the press and
talking to, you know, it was really,

739
00:45:38,821 --> 00:45:40,470
it was a really good neighborhood.

740
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:44,130
I don't even think he lived in the same
neighborhood, man just showed up there.

741
00:45:44,170 --> 00:45:47,400
Yeah, I was one of those things
where I think you like blew a fuse.

742
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:50,820
He's the sergeant of arms of
show business. It was weird.

743
00:45:50,850 --> 00:45:53,190
I'm the press secretary for famous people,

744
00:45:53,191 --> 00:45:57,000
particularly weird for me because
you know, I was on the show,

745
00:45:57,180 --> 00:46:02,180
Phil friends with them. It wasn't like,
who the fuck is this guy? This guy.

746
00:46:02,190 --> 00:46:04,230
It wasn't, he wasn't like talking
about this dude all the time,

747
00:46:04,290 --> 00:46:07,470
but that's the, that's the nature of
death, you know? I mean, when you die,

748
00:46:07,590 --> 00:46:12,210
people have to make it
all about themselves. They
can't, they can't, you know,

749
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:14,620
that's,
now I'm being a plugfest.

750
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:17,460
But you're talking about a guy who
you actually knew passed away and then

751
00:46:17,461 --> 00:46:19,200
someone tried to explain them,
but you know,

752
00:46:19,201 --> 00:46:23,100
that's the plot of a world's
greatest dad kid. Spoiler alert,

753
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:27,710
Robin's son in that movie
dies rubbing one out, uh,

754
00:46:27,870 --> 00:46:30,600
with a belt around his neck
and he's this horrible kid.

755
00:46:30,601 --> 00:46:33,240
And then everybody at
school now loves his kid.

756
00:46:33,241 --> 00:46:36,900
And he was a great friend because
Robin makes it look like a suicide.

757
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:42,630
Hangs the kid from a chin up bar and
then writes a suicide note that is way

758
00:46:42,631 --> 00:46:45,990
better written than anything. This kid
who was a fucking numb nuts could ever,

759
00:46:45,991 --> 00:46:49,960
right. And the kids go online and
they publish it in the school papers.

760
00:46:49,961 --> 00:46:53,700
So now Robin keeps writing as
his dead son to get play. Like,

761
00:46:53,730 --> 00:46:56,780
like there's a woman he's trying to bang.
It's just like going,

762
00:46:57,230 --> 00:47:00,690
did Kyle writing anything
else? And he's like, yeah,

763
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:03,030
he keeps writing as his dead son.

764
00:47:03,140 --> 00:47:05,810
Wow. That's bizarre. And
it's called the world. That's

765
00:47:05,830 --> 00:47:09,140
great. His Dad. But there's
a scene in that, you know,
Chris from Nirvana was, and,

766
00:47:09,220 --> 00:47:14,220
and Chris just had weird cameo because
Robin's son is really into a fucked up

767
00:47:14,801 --> 00:47:19,770
porn, you know, like shies of porn and
all this stuff in the movie. And then, uh,

768
00:47:19,810 --> 00:47:24,490
not, not Robin's real stuff. And so,

769
00:47:24,850 --> 00:47:29,680
and so there's just a scene where Robin
is standing in front of a porn and he

770
00:47:29,681 --> 00:47:31,140
just starts sobbing and,

771
00:47:31,141 --> 00:47:34,660
and Chris plays the newsman when he
comes over and he gives him a hug.

772
00:47:34,661 --> 00:47:39,040
And it's a really weird scene because
hardcore porn reminds him of his dead son.

773
00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:44,230
It's a very touching, odd, fucked
up scene. Jeez. But Chris, uh,

774
00:47:44,290 --> 00:47:47,590
you know, I'd say, Hey, Chris, you know,
what's the scene about? He know, he said,

775
00:47:47,591 --> 00:47:49,600
what's the scene by? I go, you
know, when someone passes away,

776
00:47:49,601 --> 00:47:53,140
people tend to make it all
about themselves and they
don't really make it about

777
00:47:53,141 --> 00:47:57,970
the person that, or the
people that actually knew the
person. And, and Chris goes,

778
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:02,970
I have no idea what you're
talking about. So, so it's, uh,

779
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,640
that's one of my favorite
scenes in the movie. It's like,

780
00:48:04,870 --> 00:48:06,190
it's just such a short scene.

781
00:48:06,191 --> 00:48:09,870
But I realized that he gets over his
son's death way too fast. Now what?

782
00:48:09,871 --> 00:48:12,730
We're ruining the movie for anyone
who would be interested in seeing it.

783
00:48:12,731 --> 00:48:14,530
But at this point,
if you haven't seen it,

784
00:48:14,570 --> 00:48:18,710
the good news is 90% of the people
listening to this are high as fuck.

785
00:48:18,711 --> 00:48:23,050
And they will have forgotten everything
that you said. What about the movie?

786
00:48:23,110 --> 00:48:26,050
Bobcat just says it's awesome,
but did you know it's really weird

787
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:27,270
because you don't normally,
like,

788
00:48:27,271 --> 00:48:29,820
I think people see the movie and
then that gets going to be, you know,

789
00:48:29,821 --> 00:48:33,270
him and his kid are always just
bashing each other and they think, oh,

790
00:48:33,271 --> 00:48:36,750
at the end they're going to become
friends. And it's like, no, page 40,

791
00:48:36,751 --> 00:48:40,100
I killed the fucker. Whoa. Right.

792
00:48:42,630 --> 00:48:45,990
So, uh, yeah. So that's
world's greatest dad.

793
00:48:46,050 --> 00:48:50,880
And then God bless America is the new
one, which is, uh, it's about a guy again.

794
00:48:50,910 --> 00:48:55,240
Uh, it's about a guy who's suicidal, um,

795
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:57,780
kind of pushed over the edge by,
uh,

796
00:48:57,810 --> 00:49:00,480
diagnosed with a brain tumor
and a bunch of other things.

797
00:49:00,540 --> 00:49:04,200
And he's sitting at home with a gun in
his mouth and he's watching my super

798
00:49:04,201 --> 00:49:07,680
sweet 16. So he decides instead of, uh,

799
00:49:07,710 --> 00:49:09,770
committing suicide that he's going to,
uh,

800
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:14,310
drive 400 miles and shoot and kill
the girl from my super sweet 16,

801
00:49:14,430 --> 00:49:18,930
which he does. He shoots the girl
and then her classmates like,

802
00:49:18,931 --> 00:49:22,200
did you kill Chloe? And he doesn't
say anything. And she goes, awesome.

803
00:49:22,410 --> 00:49:25,650
And so this young girl convinces them
that there's so many more douchebags in

804
00:49:25,651 --> 00:49:30,210
the world that needs to die. So, uh,
another lighthearted movie from me

805
00:49:36,630 --> 00:49:40,770
sing with a woman, Schumer. This side
throws the Tampon. Every other woman.

806
00:49:41,850 --> 00:49:45,870
Do you have any family? Oh God, take this.

807
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:53,010
My name is Chloe. I live in
Virginia Beach and everyone must be,

808
00:49:53,011 --> 00:49:53,930
because I'm so pretty

809
00:49:59,970 --> 00:50:02,580
creepy isn't a school girl
thing a little played out.

810
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:06,000
Don't move and don't make a sound if you
want the car just taking my parents got

811
00:50:06,001 --> 00:50:08,340
me the wrong one. Anyways,
that's a fucking tragedy.

812
00:50:10,170 --> 00:50:11,340
Did you just kill flowy?

813
00:50:13,350 --> 00:50:14,183
Awesome.

814
00:50:14,860 --> 00:50:18,850
That was a fantastic start. That new.
Who else really rips my cock off to her?

815
00:50:18,851 --> 00:50:22,270
Dashi and will we use rock stars?
Magic 10 and who called their tits?

816
00:50:22,271 --> 00:50:24,130
The girl who was crystals.

817
00:50:26,630 --> 00:50:28,020
You're aiming the bear, right? This

818
00:50:28,030 --> 00:50:28,863
is the best day.

819
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:39,730
Don't let me
recording this.

820
00:50:42,190 --> 00:50:45,190
Thanks for turning off your cell phone.
You're welcome.

821
00:50:46,670 --> 00:50:51,190
Why have a civilization if we no
longer interested in being civilized

822
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:58,300
buddy? What's wrong? Not
a crazy people out there

823
00:51:00,630 --> 00:51:04,930
who want to kill people who deserve to
die. We're going to do this or what.

824
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:10,060
I know it's not normal to want to kill,
but I am no longer normal

825
00:51:15,670 --> 00:51:19,780
here. We got to take both of those
spots. Yeah. Fuck you. Fuck you.

826
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:24,780
So awesome.
Got a lot of region.

827
00:51:27,870 --> 00:51:28,703
I did not.

828
00:51:29,090 --> 00:51:33,300
I like to say that movie is
a very violent movie about

829
00:51:33,460 --> 00:51:35,040
kindness.
That's how I describe it.

830
00:51:35,140 --> 00:51:38,290
Because all frank wants his people
to act right. You know, and,

831
00:51:38,291 --> 00:51:42,880
and the movie came about when I kept
seeing people acting really insane.

832
00:51:42,881 --> 00:51:44,230
You know,
like at these uh,

833
00:51:44,410 --> 00:51:48,610
town hall meetings where people were
shouting down people in. And you know,

834
00:51:48,611 --> 00:51:52,840
I remember seeing a tea party sign.
It's kind of a popular one. It says,

835
00:51:52,841 --> 00:51:57,410
we came on arm this time and I was like,
well, that's really crazy, man. You know?

836
00:51:57,460 --> 00:51:59,830
That's really, yeah. And I was like, okay,

837
00:51:59,831 --> 00:52:03,010
I see you're crazy and I
raise you're crazy. You know?

838
00:52:03,011 --> 00:52:07,420
And that's the idea behind this
movie. It's just that it isn't, um,

839
00:52:07,510 --> 00:52:10,960
a list of people who I really wish
would die. Um, I am nonviolent.

840
00:52:10,961 --> 00:52:15,400
I don't believe in the death penalty
or anything, but, but, but I, you know,

841
00:52:15,430 --> 00:52:19,830
it's kind of fighting fire with
fire. I, I just wanted to, you know,

842
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:23,170
really push it and not make a movie.
You know,

843
00:52:23,220 --> 00:52:27,580
if you make a movie and you make fun of
these people, then they can go, oh yeah,

844
00:52:27,581 --> 00:52:29,590
that's me. Ha ha ha. You know,

845
00:52:29,591 --> 00:52:33,370
there's like in the new sneaky
shows up in the three stooges, so,

846
00:52:33,371 --> 00:52:37,450
so even snuck his family can go, oh,
that's funny. Ha ha ha. But in my movie,

847
00:52:37,451 --> 00:52:40,660
I just kill sneaky, you know? Fuck
you. You know what I mean? I'm done.

848
00:52:43,830 --> 00:52:48,280
I keep wigging out, Joe. So,
no, it's, it's, so, it's,

849
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:52,320
I'm just trying to wrap my head around
it. I don't kill them for real. I mean,

850
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:53,430
I'm not just

851
00:52:53,430 --> 00:52:58,350
don't feel comfortable saying and
making it, you know, we're, we really,

852
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:01,390
you know, I, my point
is, is, is what is the,

853
00:53:01,470 --> 00:53:05,490
why do we have all these distractions? Do
you know what I'm saying? And, and, um,

854
00:53:05,850 --> 00:53:09,300
I'm not against reality television show.
I'm not against all this stuff,

855
00:53:09,330 --> 00:53:13,830
but what I'm saying is we're not really
going to come to any solutions when we

856
00:53:13,831 --> 00:53:18,120
spend all of our time and name
calling and bashing each other.

857
00:53:18,150 --> 00:53:23,070
Now people go, well, your movie is
very, you know, slanted to the left.

858
00:53:23,071 --> 00:53:25,770
And it's like, yeah, I think
the left has lot of problems.

859
00:53:25,771 --> 00:53:30,150
But I do believe the right
his way Nastier. And it
was kind of like me saying,

860
00:53:30,750 --> 00:53:34,530
all right, this might be funny. Uh, a
liberal with a brain tumor and a gun.

861
00:53:34,900 --> 00:53:36,730
I hate the idea of the left and the right.

862
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:40,150
I really do our thing because it doesn't
come up when they solutions. Well,

863
00:53:40,151 --> 00:53:44,350
not only that, it's just this idea that
there's only two ideologies. So stupid.

864
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:47,000
Everyone's a combination
of both for the mall

865
00:53:47,550 --> 00:53:51,240
to be or, but, but people choose
not to be. People just say,

866
00:53:51,241 --> 00:53:56,241
I've decided that I am this ideology and
so all my decisions are made up for me

867
00:53:56,431 --> 00:54:00,870
and I don't have to make my own
opinion on certain things. And, and um,

868
00:54:01,530 --> 00:54:04,410
and, and, you know, uh,
an example would be like,

869
00:54:04,470 --> 00:54:09,360
I agree with bill O'Reilly on the
death penalty. He's against it.

870
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:14,840
He and I can never come together because
he is too busy making his living just,

871
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:18,750
you know, a fanning flames.
He against the death penalty,

872
00:54:19,130 --> 00:54:22,950
I'm sure for him it has to do with his
Catholicism. You know, that's my guess.

873
00:54:22,951 --> 00:54:23,784
I don't know why,

874
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:30,040
but yet he's pro war.
Yeah. Well, yeah. Well,

875
00:54:30,050 --> 00:54:34,960
I also, uh, yeah, well, Catholicism
as an adult is fascinating.

876
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:39,280
I mean, it's one thing if you're stuck
in it as a child, but as you get older,

877
00:54:39,310 --> 00:54:42,940
did you grow up Catholic? Went to Catholic
school. I went to Catholic school too.

878
00:54:42,941 --> 00:54:46,630
Did you go one year? Only one o one
year. It was horrible. It was ridiculous.

879
00:54:46,631 --> 00:54:50,260
It fixed me. It was a very true
for me. It was very traumatic time.

880
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:52,800
My parents were getting divorced and uh,

881
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:56,950
my dad would hit my mom and there was
a lot of crazy shit and we were living

882
00:54:56,970 --> 00:54:58,210
with my grandmother at the time.

883
00:54:58,890 --> 00:55:01,780
That's when I started going to
Catholic school and it was so,

884
00:55:01,790 --> 00:55:06,790
it was a trying time in my life and I
remember being really excited that I was

885
00:55:07,271 --> 00:55:10,090
going to go to Catholic school because
I was really excited about doing the

886
00:55:10,091 --> 00:55:13,600
right thing and about following the Bible
and that's how you live a happy life.

887
00:55:13,780 --> 00:55:16,960
I really like frank. The reason
why this was going on in my house,

888
00:55:16,961 --> 00:55:19,450
it was all fucked up because
everybody wasn't down with God.

889
00:55:19,451 --> 00:55:23,710
They weren't doing the right thing.
So this one can't have a nun.

890
00:55:23,711 --> 00:55:26,770
Sister Mary Josephine completely cured me.

891
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:29,320
This bitch was so evil.

892
00:55:29,321 --> 00:55:33,940
She was just so mean and just
there was nothing loving about her.

893
00:55:33,941 --> 00:55:37,960
There's nothing warm and friendly about
it. She was never happy. She never smiled.

894
00:55:38,530 --> 00:55:41,770
She just had me convinced that it was
all horse shit. I was like, oh, okay.

895
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:46,420
There's no fucking way this lady is
involved with anything legitimate.

896
00:55:46,540 --> 00:55:50,640
And he says, God, God has nothing
to do with this craziness.

897
00:55:50,670 --> 00:55:53,440
What about whose idea was
it for you to go there?

898
00:55:53,470 --> 00:55:58,070
Was it yours or it was my
parents. Uh, I think, you know,

899
00:55:58,090 --> 00:56:00,340
it was probably one of the
better schools in the area.

900
00:56:00,370 --> 00:56:04,150
It's hard to find good public schools.
It was, you know, New York, New Jersey.

901
00:56:04,310 --> 00:56:07,730
Yeah. Yeah. No, I, yeah, I went
to Catholic school my whole life.

902
00:56:07,731 --> 00:56:10,340
I want like a half a
year to a public school.

903
00:56:10,370 --> 00:56:15,200
And it was so behind that I ended up being
the janitor and my own high school so

904
00:56:15,201 --> 00:56:18,920
I could pay my tuition,
not because of any religious things,

905
00:56:18,921 --> 00:56:23,290
but the fact that the education was
better there. Wow. So I, I, you know,

906
00:56:23,291 --> 00:56:24,124
it's kind of funny.
We,

907
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:28,150
I didn't have any stigma about being
the janitor at the high school. I mean,

908
00:56:28,151 --> 00:56:33,030
I still, oddly enough, I was like
the homecoming king too. So you,

909
00:56:33,031 --> 00:56:36,700
you bought while you were going to
school there, you were also the janitor.

910
00:56:36,790 --> 00:56:40,510
I was the guy that was dayglo. Why did it
have a stigma though? I was, well, I mean,

911
00:56:40,511 --> 00:56:43,360
you know, it's not like being
the captain of the football team,

912
00:56:43,361 --> 00:56:46,630
being the guy dragging out the
empty milk carton bags, you know?

913
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:49,630
Right. But at least you were industrious
enough to figure out how to get a job.

914
00:56:49,780 --> 00:56:51,190
Yeah. No, I didn't. I mean,

915
00:56:51,191 --> 00:56:54,370
I didn't think anything was embarrassing
about it was only till later on as an

916
00:56:54,371 --> 00:56:57,610
adult, I would tell that story and
people would go, wow, you know?

917
00:56:57,730 --> 00:56:59,470
Yeah.
There's something about being a janitor,

918
00:56:59,471 --> 00:57:04,000
this particularly humbling for people.
You know, just the word janitor. You're a,

919
00:57:04,001 --> 00:57:06,940
you're a guy who's essentially,
you cleaned things up. That's it.

920
00:57:07,620 --> 00:57:09,960
I don't know why it didn't bother me.
I don't know why.

921
00:57:09,961 --> 00:57:13,620
It just seemed like it made sense to me.
If I was a janitor,

922
00:57:13,621 --> 00:57:15,090
that meant I could go to the school.

923
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:19,620
Right. Well, it's just,
it's not an impressive,

924
00:57:19,650 --> 00:57:23,330
that's why it bothers
people. You know, who, uh,

925
00:57:23,370 --> 00:57:25,380
wants to impress you with what they do.

926
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:29,130
You're right. But then I started doing
standup when I was like 15, 16 years old.

927
00:57:29,131 --> 00:57:32,610
So when I was in highschool, Tom,
Kenny and I were doing standup. Wow.

928
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:36,660
Where were you doing it?
They get dog shows and things
like that. Open mic nights.

929
00:57:36,661 --> 00:57:39,930
A Barry Crimmins who was one
of the Boston comedy guys. Uh,

930
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:44,050
he had an open mic that was in Syracuse
outside of Syracuse at the time.

931
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:48,960
We would do that every week and why our
teenagers and we had fake ids to get

932
00:57:48,961 --> 00:57:53,040
into the clubs and stuff.
Holy Shit. So what, what, how
old did you have to be? Well,

933
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:56,130
18 but then when I moved
to Boston it was 19,

934
00:57:56,131 --> 00:57:59,910
so I use my brother's Jimmy's
id to go do standup comedy.

935
00:57:59,911 --> 00:58:02,900
So sometimes like I'd be in
Worcester and bomb and, and,

936
00:58:02,940 --> 00:58:07,680
but as Jim Gulf wait,
cause I had to use my brother's ID.

937
00:58:07,770 --> 00:58:08,610
Wow.

938
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:12,550
Wow. That's fucking awesome. Then
one of the coolest things about boss,

939
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:15,600
it was all those different places you
can go in and around it, you know, to,

940
00:58:15,601 --> 00:58:16,870
to work so much

941
00:58:17,210 --> 00:58:19,110
road work.
There was a million gigs in,

942
00:58:19,111 --> 00:58:23,280
you would just pile into a car and there'd
be like four or five of you and then

943
00:58:23,610 --> 00:58:27,870
you know, that's the thing you miss
in life is, is is, is the, you know,

944
00:58:27,871 --> 00:58:29,580
the hell Gig and then the,
all of you,

945
00:58:29,581 --> 00:58:34,500
we just laugh all the way on your
tits off on the way home. Yeah. Yeah.

946
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:38,730
So that, that goes away as you get
older, which is kind of a drag. Yeah.

947
00:58:38,731 --> 00:58:42,630
That was that, that time
though, so unstable.

948
00:58:42,660 --> 00:58:46,710
You can't wait for it to be over.
When did you start doing standard 88 and,

949
00:58:46,900 --> 00:58:48,060
and how old were you?

950
00:58:48,380 --> 00:58:52,730
21 and New York and Boston.
Yeah, I started at a stitches.

951
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:57,650
Sure. Jonathan Katz was the host,
the first, neither one on stage.

952
00:58:58,560 --> 00:59:01,740
One of my last shows in Boston when I
moved out of there with it stitches,

953
00:59:01,741 --> 00:59:03,480
I took all the old one or the new one,

954
00:59:03,510 --> 00:59:07,080
the one that was the front of the
paradise, the old one, that's the Os one.

955
00:59:07,110 --> 00:59:11,940
And I had it all filled with all this
shit from my apartment and I had a garage

956
00:59:11,941 --> 00:59:16,140
sale. And up and down the street
there was signs that said garage sale,

957
00:59:16,141 --> 00:59:20,160
free coffee and like I had coffee
and donuts set up when you walked in.

958
00:59:20,161 --> 00:59:24,470
And then I sold the shit that I
lived with. All my shit was on stage.

959
00:59:24,740 --> 00:59:27,860
Wow. Oh, that's hilarious.
Well, I never really,

960
00:59:27,950 --> 00:59:30,500
I guess I've not doing
traditional standup a bunch.

961
00:59:30,501 --> 00:59:34,610
When I first got started I was kind of
making fun of it and then I became the

962
00:59:34,611 --> 00:59:36,770
thing I was trying to make fun of.
You know,

963
00:59:37,270 --> 00:59:39,970
you were trying to make fun of it
and then you got trapped in the act.

964
00:59:40,110 --> 00:59:44,670
Yeah, definitely. Yeah, definitely.
Because, because by the time I was a kid,

965
00:59:44,700 --> 00:59:47,760
I mean I loved comedy when I was
a little boy, like, you know,

966
00:59:47,761 --> 00:59:48,930
seven or eight years old,

967
00:59:48,931 --> 00:59:52,320
I was watching George Carlin on the
Dinah shore show and I said to my mom,

968
00:59:52,321 --> 00:59:55,810
what does he do for a living? And she's
like, that's what he does for a living.

969
00:59:55,811 --> 00:59:59,640
And I was like, oh, that's the, yeah,
that's the best thing ever. You know,

970
00:59:59,641 --> 01:00:02,910
I got to figure this out.
So by the time I was a teenager,

971
01:00:02,911 --> 01:00:07,620
I was kind of snarky and stamp and I was
Kinda over the comedy that was popular

972
01:00:07,621 --> 01:00:10,440
at the time. And then Steve Martin
came out and blew my mind and stuff.

973
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:14,620
So you were sort of a comedy nerd before
comedy nerds who were rowing huge, huge,

974
01:00:14,621 --> 01:00:14,920
huge.

975
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:18,670
So, so that's probably why I got burnt
out by the time I was in my early twenties

976
01:00:18,671 --> 01:00:21,040
you know about comedy, you know, people,

977
01:00:21,340 --> 01:00:25,690
people now take it so serious that it's
kind of weird. They take it, they make it,

978
01:00:25,691 --> 01:00:28,930
turn it into almost like a sports
mentality, which, you know,

979
01:00:28,931 --> 01:00:31,060
I always thought in my mind,

980
01:00:31,061 --> 01:00:34,660
the comedy I liked was always about
outsiders and Weirdos. You know,

981
01:00:34,661 --> 01:00:38,440
it wasn't about who's the best comic
and who's the number one comic and who

982
01:00:38,450 --> 01:00:43,180
sells more and who's got the most popular
podcast and Blab, Blab, Blab, you know,

983
01:00:43,570 --> 01:00:48,490
it just because just because your art
is popular pretty much sometimes doesn't

984
01:00:48,491 --> 01:00:52,210
mean it's very valid. You know, the two,
two things don't really connect, you know,

985
01:00:52,211 --> 01:00:56,500
if something's good and popular, that's
really strange. When it does happen.

986
01:00:56,810 --> 01:01:00,550
We really think so. Yeah. Yeah. But I mean
black keys. No, that's what I'm saying.

987
01:01:00,570 --> 01:01:03,400
But like something like that,
there's still not like a household name.

988
01:01:03,401 --> 01:01:05,860
You know my brain pretty huge.
Huge.

989
01:01:05,861 --> 01:01:07,930
But they're not like if I
brought those up to my sisters,

990
01:01:07,931 --> 01:01:09,940
they wouldn't know who
they are. Yeah, yeah.

991
01:01:10,060 --> 01:01:14,940
I bet they would have heard their
songs. My sister, none of my,

992
01:01:14,950 --> 01:01:17,320
yeah, no sparky. That's incredible.
And they're from a Hong Kong?

993
01:01:17,620 --> 01:01:20,280
Well they're filling
arenas. No. Really? Yeah.

994
01:01:20,460 --> 01:01:25,230
Oh they, they um, they sold out Madison
Square Garden but in like 15 minutes.

995
01:01:25,450 --> 01:01:27,900
But I'm not saying that
everything that's popular is bad,

996
01:01:27,901 --> 01:01:30,570
but I'm also saying it sounds
like I'm backpedaling now, but,

997
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:34,020
but you Kardashians is not really,

998
01:01:34,040 --> 01:01:37,490
I know what you're saying that there's a
lot of popular shit that sucks and that

999
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:40,090
just because something's probably would,
it doesn't mean it's good. I know,

1000
01:01:40,091 --> 01:01:43,650
I know what you're saying. Yeah. And
I get tired of that argument. It's a,

1001
01:01:43,770 --> 01:01:45,000
but it's easy for me,
you know,

1002
01:01:45,330 --> 01:01:48,450
cause I make my movies that
only play film festivals. Well,

1003
01:01:48,451 --> 01:01:52,230
it's a weird go right to Vod,
you know, it's, it's what are,

1004
01:01:52,290 --> 01:01:56,040
what are you trying to do, you know, are
you trying to make a blip that hits the,

1005
01:01:56,041 --> 01:01:59,160
the, the, the, the most
amount of numbers possible?

1006
01:01:59,170 --> 01:02:01,560
Are you trying to like calculating your,

1007
01:02:01,561 --> 01:02:05,730
your attack or are you doing something
that genuinely you would love?

1008
01:02:05,940 --> 01:02:09,390
And it just, this is the way you do it
and you know, people are going to like it.

1009
01:02:09,391 --> 01:02:10,680
They're not going to like it,
but you're not like,

1010
01:02:10,860 --> 01:02:14,670
you're not engineering
it for financial success.

1011
01:02:14,970 --> 01:02:18,480
Right. But I mean, look what you're
doing. I mean, look at this on paper.

1012
01:02:18,510 --> 01:02:20,010
It make any sense at

1013
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:24,390
all? You know, we're going to
combine, uh, mixed martial arts,

1014
01:02:24,391 --> 01:02:26,340
comedy and art bell.

1015
01:02:28,130 --> 01:02:31,890
It's kind of be popular no fucking way.
Well,

1016
01:02:31,891 --> 01:02:35,820
as a Canadian comedian slash cage
fighting commentator, that doesn't,

1017
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:38,500
that doesn't seem to work, you
know? Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

1018
01:02:38,501 --> 01:02:40,440
It shouldn't work.
I think it's funny.

1019
01:02:40,441 --> 01:02:43,960
It's like I owe you an apology and
you don't even know it. Like I,

1020
01:02:43,961 --> 01:02:47,100
I had until I started listening to
the show. I had some baggage with you.

1021
01:02:47,101 --> 01:02:48,750
Just because, uh, and,

1022
01:02:48,751 --> 01:02:53,340
and why it's really unfair of me to have
it was I had a preconceived notion of

1023
01:02:53,341 --> 01:02:57,990
you from, from what you did on
television and, and I'm like,

1024
01:02:58,350 --> 01:03:02,040
if anybody should cut
anyone's in fucking slack,

1025
01:03:02,070 --> 01:03:05,420
it's the dude from police academy.
Do you know what I mean? Like I like,

1026
01:03:05,570 --> 01:03:09,990
like I had this ego thing
going, well, she's doing
standard. You know what I mean?

1027
01:03:09,991 --> 01:03:13,930
We're just like, oh, you're the fucking
purist. He said, oh, that's funny.

1028
01:03:13,950 --> 01:03:16,970
The dude from hot to trot and
you're going to be the guy from,

1029
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:20,130
from fear factors to a
natural thing though.

1030
01:03:20,131 --> 01:03:24,540
If you have any personal anx to sorta
like look for different little weak spots.

1031
01:03:24,541 --> 01:03:27,900
Some of that's not cool, man. That's
not cool. But it's a natural thing.

1032
01:03:28,740 --> 01:03:29,670
I don't,

1033
01:03:29,671 --> 01:03:33,540
I didn't owe you an apology because I
never went anywhere and said that openly.

1034
01:03:33,541 --> 01:03:36,750
But you know what I mean?
I would completely understand it,

1035
01:03:37,050 --> 01:03:40,650
but for me it was like there's no way
I can not do that shows too much money.

1036
01:03:40,660 --> 01:03:42,970
It was to look,

1037
01:03:43,170 --> 01:03:47,040
I was the voice of a fruitcake last
year so I'm not about to fucking judge

1038
01:03:47,130 --> 01:03:50,610
anything you do, but I completely
understand people making fun of it.

1039
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:54,630
I mean I make fun of it. Yeah. I
didn't make fun of my stuff too, but,

1040
01:03:54,660 --> 01:03:57,600
but I shouldn't judge anybody.
I went,

1041
01:03:57,630 --> 01:04:01,320
they asked me there was a celebrity
version of the show. Is that right?

1042
01:04:01,710 --> 01:04:04,050
Of what show of your
sheriff? Yeah, there's a few.

1043
01:04:04,350 --> 01:04:08,700
We did a bunch of them cause they asked
me to and and like I only like things

1044
01:04:08,701 --> 01:04:12,450
that can fuck up that I know
will make air and I really did.

1045
01:04:12,451 --> 01:04:15,000
The idea I came up with
it was like to put like a,

1046
01:04:15,001 --> 01:04:20,001
a bag of putting in my pants like brown
pudding and then wait until me being

1047
01:04:20,671 --> 01:04:22,620
suspended somewhere and be like,

1048
01:04:23,510 --> 01:04:28,350
oh I really got to get down and just
open up the bag of pudding. It just said,

1049
01:04:30,690 --> 01:04:34,860
but it wouldn't have made the air.
I would have fought for it.

1050
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:39,570
It was really the thing I was thinking.
I was like, how can I fuck this up?

1051
01:04:39,570 --> 01:04:41,520
Maybe it would have made
it, you know, my commitment.

1052
01:04:41,521 --> 01:04:44,610
I actually wouldn't have sat there all
day with a bag full of pudding in my

1053
01:04:44,611 --> 01:04:49,530
pants because my commitment to fuck
things up is pretty good. I believe it.

1054
01:04:50,820 --> 01:04:53,280
We did it with the,
like Penn and teller did it.

1055
01:04:54,170 --> 01:04:56,640
A bunch of different people do it.
It was fun.

1056
01:04:56,790 --> 01:05:00,930
It was the food things that turned me off.
I couldn't do the most recent,

1057
01:05:00,931 --> 01:05:03,360
you know, we did it again recently.
We did another season of it,

1058
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:06,400
like after like six years of
being wealthier and the the,

1059
01:05:06,500 --> 01:05:09,660
the new season people had
a drink donkey suburb.

1060
01:05:11,490 --> 01:05:15,390
It got leaked out on GMC.
It got leaked on Tmz,

1061
01:05:15,391 --> 01:05:18,130
TMZ got pictures of the glasses,
these

1062
01:05:18,220 --> 01:05:23,220
fucking venti Starbucks
mug full of donkey come.

1063
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:29,520
Then people started protesting
and then pull the episode and so,

1064
01:05:29,941 --> 01:05:32,280
and then NBC pulled the episode and
they just cancel the show. They're like,

1065
01:05:32,281 --> 01:05:36,780
that's it. That's me. That's
my morning radio show moniker.

1066
01:05:36,840 --> 01:05:40,410
Donkey come doggy called
Dennis tele come and Dave.

1067
01:05:42,030 --> 01:05:47,020
But so, well that was it. They
all did it. It was nailed.

1068
01:05:47,021 --> 01:05:47,510
It

1069
01:05:47,510 --> 01:05:51,830
play horseshoes and this one is
who's three, three groups of twins.

1070
01:05:52,040 --> 01:05:56,330
One boy, two girls. So
four, four, four girls.

1071
01:05:56,331 --> 01:05:57,200
And one of them,

1072
01:05:57,201 --> 01:06:01,400
they had to decide they would play
horseshoes and one of them would be one

1073
01:06:01,401 --> 01:06:06,401
represent a donkey come and the other
one would represent donkey urine,

1074
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:09,800
which is a was actually cows,
Yara and I think it was,

1075
01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:13,370
which is way the urine
is way easier to swallow.

1076
01:06:13,371 --> 01:06:16,970
Once you get past the fact that it's
you're in and just throw it down,

1077
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:18,080
it's really not that big a deal.

1078
01:06:18,081 --> 01:06:21,020
It's actually you can get
away with it and they boil it.

1079
01:06:21,021 --> 01:06:23,070
They make sure it's sterile,
but

1080
01:06:25,010 --> 01:06:26,150
it's just so ridiculous.

1081
01:06:27,020 --> 01:06:29,780
But the other person would
have to drink the come so they,

1082
01:06:29,930 --> 01:06:33,350
they would play horseshoes and
everyone landed on the same thing.

1083
01:06:33,351 --> 01:06:37,590
They all wound up drinking 24 ounces and
you can't believe they're really going

1084
01:06:37,591 --> 01:06:40,100
to do it. You can't believe the real
good. Do they lay it out in the glasses?

1085
01:06:40,280 --> 01:06:41,113
These people drank.

1086
01:06:41,430 --> 01:06:44,900
I mean it's really crazy to watch
because there's essentially come all over

1087
01:06:44,901 --> 01:06:47,240
their face because they're not,
it's not going down. And clean.

1088
01:06:47,330 --> 01:06:51,320
So calm is dripping down, their cheeks
comes in their clothes. And I'm like,

1089
01:06:51,350 --> 01:06:53,540
for Real,
this is my job,

1090
01:06:53,640 --> 01:06:55,070
Disney,
this is a job.

1091
01:06:56,640 --> 01:07:00,120
And so I was telling them that this
ridiculous, I was like, you can't,

1092
01:07:00,180 --> 01:07:04,260
this is never going to air on NBC.
He's given us the green light.

1093
01:07:04,270 --> 01:07:07,080
They approve this episode.
They approved the, you know,

1094
01:07:07,260 --> 01:07:09,690
it got through standards and practices.
Like really,

1095
01:07:09,720 --> 01:07:13,680
really what time was that going to
be on regular time? Eight o'clock.

1096
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:17,520
And so did they actually,
uh, they actually,

1097
01:07:17,630 --> 01:07:22,200
did they say it was not a, what
word am I looking for? Not Purified.

1098
01:07:22,590 --> 01:07:23,423
Sterilized.

1099
01:07:23,610 --> 01:07:27,420
Well, donkey come is sterile
because donkeys are hybrids.

1100
01:07:27,510 --> 01:07:31,950
Sea Horse come is the reason. This is
how fear factor it would work safe.

1101
01:07:31,980 --> 01:07:35,220
We found some people were eating something
and some other culture like Balut,

1102
01:07:35,221 --> 01:07:39,090
which is like this chicken embryo
or duck embryo that they love.

1103
01:07:39,091 --> 01:07:42,540
And the Philippines in America
is like, what the fuck is
that? Oh, it's disgusting.

1104
01:07:42,780 --> 01:07:44,730
And their country, it's, it's normal.

1105
01:07:44,731 --> 01:07:46,800
So we have to just find
something that's fucked up.

1106
01:07:46,801 --> 01:07:49,440
And other countries that people
eat because they're starving.

1107
01:07:49,441 --> 01:07:51,690
And we get people to eat it.
So in New Zealand,

1108
01:07:51,691 --> 01:07:56,691
some crazy assholes decided to start
selling shots of horse semen at bars.

1109
01:07:57,060 --> 01:07:59,450
So people get fucked up.
You have a few tequilas like

1110
01:08:00,130 --> 01:08:04,030
hotshot mate, let's do it all shot.
And you're doing it red bull. Yeah.

1111
01:08:04,830 --> 01:08:07,780
Natural red bull supposedly supposedly
gives you like a little letter.

1112
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:11,910
I think the energy is just like, I just
swallowed the fucking, that's exciting.

1113
01:08:12,050 --> 01:08:15,710
No fucking way. Doing your heart's
beating faster. You just like Holy Shit.

1114
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:21,020
It feels like drugs. So the, because
of that, the producers extrapolated.

1115
01:08:21,050 --> 01:08:25,130
Oh well then we'll make people drink
a big gulp of donkey jazz and they got

1116
01:08:25,131 --> 01:08:28,490
donkey just cause it's cheaper
chiller because it's useless.

1117
01:08:28,520 --> 01:08:30,540
It doesn't really make
donkeys. Oh I got, yeah,

1118
01:08:30,620 --> 01:08:32,750
because they're sterile cause
the shooting blanks. Yeah.

1119
01:08:32,751 --> 01:08:36,050
And the way they get them
is they use a cattle prod,

1120
01:08:36,110 --> 01:08:39,530
they stick it up to donkey's ass and it,
you know,

1121
01:08:39,780 --> 01:08:42,110
say rusty tromboning
next year. Yeah, exactly.

1122
01:08:42,590 --> 01:08:47,590
Triggers is his area blasts and then
they just gather it all up and sell it to

1123
01:08:48,981 --> 01:08:49,814
fear factor.

1124
01:08:50,050 --> 01:08:52,820
And now you said you tasted it just
because you wanted it to taste it?

1125
01:08:53,240 --> 01:08:54,530
I ate some,
some

1126
01:08:55,830 --> 01:09:00,020
wait, well, I'd say some cooked cop.
No, wait, what are you talking about?

1127
01:09:00,790 --> 01:09:01,630
I'm just kidding.

1128
01:09:07,300 --> 01:09:10,200
I'm trying to come up with a way that
it's better. I don't know man. Tom,

1129
01:09:10,210 --> 01:09:12,810
my aid was totally cool.
Omelet.

1130
01:09:14,310 --> 01:09:14,521
Yeah,

1131
01:09:14,521 --> 01:09:17,700
I was watching the Anthony Bourdain show
and he was at a Sushi restaurant where

1132
01:09:17,701 --> 01:09:21,900
they were serving com. They serve
a sperm sacks and they, they're,

1133
01:09:21,940 --> 01:09:25,500
they're eating this sperm sacks in the
sperm and they're like, oh, this is,

1134
01:09:25,501 --> 01:09:26,370
I'm good sperm.

1135
01:09:27,380 --> 01:09:32,190
Well, you were talking about a
sterilize. My, my wife was, uh, uh,

1136
01:09:32,210 --> 01:09:36,710
worked on jackass too, where
they did drink the member, the,

1137
01:09:36,980 --> 01:09:40,280
there's the horse berm, I believe
his Pontius, I think, but,

1138
01:09:40,310 --> 01:09:44,660
but there's a scene where
she's glowing pubes guys face.

1139
01:09:44,980 --> 01:09:48,730
If you saw that, did you
see it? No. No. Check us two

1140
01:09:50,430 --> 01:09:51,680
good movies give me anxiety.

1141
01:09:52,430 --> 01:09:57,230
She's gluing pukes out and the
guy's face as a fake beard,

1142
01:09:57,231 --> 01:10:02,030
but he thinks it's, he likes
his real hair or whatever. But,

1143
01:10:02,031 --> 01:10:06,540
um, they asked, they said,
did you, did you sterilize
this? And she's like, oh yeah,

1144
01:10:07,050 --> 01:10:11,110
like, are you going to
sterilize the condition? It's
like all the guys in the, uh,

1145
01:10:11,111 --> 01:10:15,350
you know, all the jackass guys had had
shaved their pubes and then, I mean,

1146
01:10:15,351 --> 01:10:16,970
there was a longer gag going on and I was,

1147
01:10:16,971 --> 01:10:20,880
the guy didn't know that they
gave him a Pew Beers, but, uh,

1148
01:10:22,470 --> 01:10:27,160
I love that, that look where
he's at. That's my gal, you
know, just, uh, but, but um,

1149
01:10:27,240 --> 01:10:31,460
it's funny story was, uh, after
that I was at a screening and, um,

1150
01:10:32,180 --> 01:10:36,040
and I know Billy crystal over the
years and uh, he comes up and goes, oh,

1151
01:10:36,060 --> 01:10:38,720
I just saw that jackass
too, you know. Oh my God,

1152
01:10:38,721 --> 01:10:43,340
that the glue and pubes on a guy's
face. And I go, Oh yeah, that's,

1153
01:10:43,341 --> 01:10:46,270
that's my wife. That's, that's,

1154
01:10:46,790 --> 01:10:51,230
that's the old girl.
He looks and he realizes,

1155
01:10:51,240 --> 01:10:52,980
Holy Shit,
it really is though.

1156
01:10:54,610 --> 01:10:57,630
It's pretty uncomfortable for
a beat there. But you know,

1157
01:10:57,860 --> 01:11:00,890
what are you going to do though? I
shouldn't, she's a costume designer.

1158
01:11:00,891 --> 01:11:04,850
But she did that, you know, cause she'll,
she'll go along with the gag. Right.

1159
01:11:04,851 --> 01:11:09,830
But um, but, but, but she gets
called still for people saying,

1160
01:11:09,831 --> 01:11:14,010
hey, will you do makeup? And
it's like I only have one makeup

1161
01:11:14,010 --> 01:11:15,990
look glue and pubes on the guy's face.

1162
01:11:17,340 --> 01:11:20,820
If you want Brian Wilson to
have a big beard, I'm your guy.

1163
01:11:21,780 --> 01:11:25,560
Somehow or another, she just got
attached to that. I think you do it once,

1164
01:11:25,561 --> 01:11:28,740
you know, just one, give
one, one cube beard.

1165
01:11:28,950 --> 01:11:32,490
I couldn't watch a jackass after I
watched the one clip of Johnny Knoxville

1166
01:11:32,491 --> 01:11:35,940
putting a blindfold on and
he lets a bowl launch, Adam,

1167
01:11:36,450 --> 01:11:39,300
the ball just attacks him and he goes
flying through the air and I'm like,

1168
01:11:39,301 --> 01:11:43,050
what the fuck? You're a movie
star Dude. What are you doing?

1169
01:11:43,110 --> 01:11:47,000
There's so much more to those movies other
than that you'd love and you would be,

1170
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:51,240
can't watch you play
clips in her way more.

1171
01:11:51,270 --> 01:11:56,160
Sometimes offensive or shocking than
that. But on the Shelly, me, if we do it,

1172
01:11:56,161 --> 01:11:59,760
it's, you know, not for the whole
show, you know, like an hour.

1173
01:11:59,761 --> 01:12:03,440
I know Jack has like an hour and a half
of guys getting fucking hitting the nuts,

1174
01:12:03,810 --> 01:12:07,840
shotgun blast and it's like I
can't watch it all. It's too crazy.

1175
01:12:08,370 --> 01:12:10,980
You're too sensitive.
I might be,

1176
01:12:11,420 --> 01:12:13,250
you know,
you would think that I would be,

1177
01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:15,980
I've seen so many people get
fucked up in a real life.

1178
01:12:16,280 --> 01:12:20,900
Like the May commentary being that close
to the cage. You think I'd be like,

1179
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:24,080
you know that that kind of stuff
wouldn't bother me anymore.

1180
01:12:24,230 --> 01:12:26,390
But the stuff like where I know
someone's going to get injured

1181
01:12:26,420 --> 01:12:31,010
still still still make,
it gives me the Heebie jeebies crashes,

1182
01:12:31,250 --> 01:12:33,200
anything ski crashes,

1183
01:12:33,350 --> 01:12:38,350
anything where your leg trip twists
backwards and slow mo and these injuries

1184
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:41,750
that way I've had on him. I
know what it's like. Yeah.

1185
01:12:41,830 --> 01:12:46,400
It's not funny when see it once you
pee blood once. It's just not as funny.

1186
01:12:46,610 --> 01:12:47,443
It's not funny.

1187
01:12:50,820 --> 01:12:54,690
Did you have others? Japanese chef
who's a, he says he's asexual.

1188
01:12:54,691 --> 01:12:55,680
He's 22 years old.

1189
01:12:55,980 --> 01:12:59,810
He auctioned his cock
and balls off for uh,

1190
01:12:59,811 --> 01:13:03,570
a banquet that he was going to give.
He gave a banquet,

1191
01:13:03,870 --> 01:13:06,660
had his dick and balls surgically removed.

1192
01:13:07,530 --> 01:13:12,530
And then serve them to the patrons
for like 150,000 yen or something.

1193
01:13:14,100 --> 01:13:16,560
No, it wasn't. I don't really
think it was that much money. No,

1194
01:13:16,561 --> 01:13:20,170
it wasn't that much money. It was
like pretty cheap. Yeah. How crazy.

1195
01:13:22,130 --> 01:13:25,710
I'm haggling here. Um, I'm
trying to figure, well, you know,

1196
01:13:25,711 --> 01:13:29,100
it'd be a shame if he did all that trouble
and then they didn't taste so good.

1197
01:13:29,220 --> 01:13:33,630
You know what I mean? Sure. I showed
up my balls a little over done.

1198
01:13:33,900 --> 01:13:36,360
If Dick's tasted really good,
people beating them all the time.

1199
01:13:36,390 --> 01:13:40,470
There's a reason why you buy at the
pet store and they serve them to dogs.

1200
01:13:40,610 --> 01:13:43,350
You know, if Dick was like better
than flaming yawn, you know,

1201
01:13:43,380 --> 01:13:47,240
we would be eating dick, eating an
animal. But the Japanese do. I mean,

1202
01:13:47,241 --> 01:13:50,370
they're all lead animal. Dick's.
I know he's balls, balls.

1203
01:13:50,371 --> 01:13:54,900
Are they actually taste good though? Like
Rocky Mountain Oysters? No, I haven't,

1204
01:13:56,120 --> 01:14:00,480
but I mean, people love them.
No, I haven't had them. But
people say they love him.

1205
01:14:00,481 --> 01:14:04,080
You know, Rocky Mountain Oysters
apparently to people have had them,

1206
01:14:04,120 --> 01:14:07,410
they taste delicious.
I just don't think I ever had one.

1207
01:14:07,800 --> 01:14:11,530
I've never looked down at my junk.
Gets at, you know, with some parsley

1208
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:13,390
maybe with some onions.

1209
01:14:13,930 --> 01:14:14,201
Yeah.

1210
01:14:14,201 --> 01:14:17,890
Just imagine if that was the best part
of the bowl to kill a whole bowl just to

1211
01:14:17,891 --> 01:14:18,730
get his balls.

1212
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:23,740
People do it pulls away the cow
bull balls where the caviar of the,

1213
01:14:23,860 --> 01:14:24,850
the animal kingdom

1214
01:14:24,990 --> 01:14:29,580
now do you, do you uh, yeah, I w how did
we end up talking about eating balls?

1215
01:14:30,120 --> 01:14:33,840
Probably a fear factor
subject. Oh, sorry. My bad.

1216
01:14:34,620 --> 01:14:37,620
That's what it was, is the people
who drink come. That's what,

1217
01:14:38,100 --> 01:14:42,840
that's what killed the second season.
You mean the new season, the newest,

1218
01:14:42,990 --> 01:14:47,320
the second version where you bummed out
that got killed. No. Was happening. Like

1219
01:14:49,160 --> 01:14:52,350
I could have been doing that show
again for those six years because they,

1220
01:14:52,710 --> 01:14:56,300
they're doing a reboot of police academy.
Are they really going to do it?

1221
01:14:56,890 --> 01:15:01,110
No, they're not even going to ask
me, but I said that I go, yeah,

1222
01:15:01,111 --> 01:15:02,750
they're going to reboot it. Like, um,

1223
01:15:03,480 --> 01:15:06,570
like how they did a 21 jump street.

1224
01:15:06,571 --> 01:15:08,620
They're going to make it
a comedy sexy and cool.

1225
01:15:09,860 --> 01:15:12,680
They're going to make it a comedy.
You know,

1226
01:15:12,810 --> 01:15:16,740
I think I annoyed the producers so much
that they wouldn't actually have me back

1227
01:15:16,741 --> 01:15:18,780
and police academy. Really? Why?

1228
01:15:19,110 --> 01:15:22,620
Cause I was kind of a deck when we made
those movies. I mean, I wasn't like,

1229
01:15:23,850 --> 01:15:27,930
it wasn't like I was an asshole, but
I was also, I wasn't like going, hey,

1230
01:15:27,931 --> 01:15:31,740
this is really great what we're doing. Do
you know what I mean? Like I, you know,

1231
01:15:31,741 --> 01:15:35,550
I had a sense of humor about it. I didn't
really think, oh, this is the, you know,

1232
01:15:35,551 --> 01:15:40,180
the finest moments in cinema, you know?
So, uh, because of that I was, uh,

1233
01:15:40,260 --> 01:15:43,680
considered a pain in the ass that,
and sometimes I would say, hey,

1234
01:15:43,681 --> 01:15:45,360
how about at the beginning of the movie,

1235
01:15:45,361 --> 01:15:49,200
we have these bad guys that at the end
we could catch and the producer get

1236
01:15:49,201 --> 01:15:51,710
really mad. Like, oh, what are
you trying to do? You know,

1237
01:15:51,720 --> 01:15:55,050
they get mad at me for trying
it tried it suggest a plot.

1238
01:15:55,870 --> 01:15:59,090
Like I just thought
maybe if, oh, all right.

1239
01:15:59,130 --> 01:16:02,990
Did you try to change the
tone of the movie? No.

1240
01:16:03,370 --> 01:16:07,600
Make grittier this. I mean, you ever
come to them and go, listen man, listen,

1241
01:16:07,620 --> 01:16:09,750
do something to mix this up.
This is bullshit.

1242
01:16:09,780 --> 01:16:13,230
Zed wouldn't say this set
is from the streets, man.

1243
01:16:13,350 --> 01:16:17,820
A friend of mine is a director and a,
she's a very reasonable person.

1244
01:16:18,090 --> 01:16:22,410
And she was telling me some great stories
about working with actors that would

1245
01:16:22,411 --> 01:16:26,020
come to them and say, I think my character
should be in a bikini. And this theme,

1246
01:16:26,550 --> 01:16:30,030
like for no reason, like this is
a mother. She's a mother of four,

1247
01:16:30,250 --> 01:16:32,410
which she's going to answer
the door in a bikini, you know,

1248
01:16:32,420 --> 01:16:35,400
and she has a really like young haircut.
I'm thinking like shaved and this.

1249
01:16:35,401 --> 01:16:38,130
I was like, bitch, you're 50. [inaudible]
the fuck are you talking about?

1250
01:16:38,131 --> 01:16:41,790
Like they want to like
completely reworked. All of
a sudden they're creative.

1251
01:16:41,890 --> 01:16:44,020
You know, they take a Xanax or
whatever the fuck they're on.

1252
01:16:44,120 --> 01:16:48,500
Yeah, no, I would have, uh, I
remember, uh, the guy who played, uh,

1253
01:16:48,590 --> 01:16:53,270
pepe the clown and shakes and he would
just be for the scene just before we say

1254
01:16:53,271 --> 01:16:56,050
action, we've got, I think Bobcat, I'm,

1255
01:16:56,570 --> 01:16:59,060
I think my character
would have a Schnauzer

1256
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:07,870
wowzers door. Oh yeah, sure.

1257
01:17:08,370 --> 01:17:10,160
Go get you a snazzier.
Let's

1258
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:14,880
just do the scene. The way
it's written, the people there,

1259
01:17:14,881 --> 01:17:17,840
there are certain actors that
when they go on to a movie you,

1260
01:17:17,841 --> 01:17:20,960
you sort of assume that they're
going to rewrite things, right?

1261
01:17:21,530 --> 01:17:24,050
There's certain actors that
have that kind of launch,

1262
01:17:24,160 --> 01:17:28,120
but you kind of, you know, you hope
folks are on the same page. So,

1263
01:17:28,540 --> 01:17:31,420
so when they're,
when they're rewriting or changing stuff,

1264
01:17:31,421 --> 01:17:35,080
it's in a similar tone and it's about
the story and it's making you better,

1265
01:17:35,081 --> 01:17:35,630
you know?

1266
01:17:35,630 --> 01:17:38,870
Right. But when you have an actor
doing that, there's nothing get weird.

1267
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,730
It's so far I've, I've
only, I think I, you know,

1268
01:17:41,731 --> 01:17:44,850
everybody I work with are friends of
mine and there are always people that are

1269
01:17:44,851 --> 01:17:46,080
on the same page,
you know,

1270
01:17:46,900 --> 01:17:49,920
if he can just work with a group of
your friends or on a regular basis.

1271
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,490
Yeah. I mean I really do think
that like people thought like,

1272
01:17:52,520 --> 01:17:55,580
oh you work with Robin Williams, you know,
that he was going to be spinning out,

1273
01:17:55,610 --> 01:17:58,880
you know, doing his Improv's and
stuff. And it was more like, you know,

1274
01:17:58,881 --> 01:18:01,460
he knew this guy and he ad libs or any

1275
01:18:01,490 --> 01:18:05,780
changes were really valid. You know,
they were his suggestions. You know,

1276
01:18:05,870 --> 01:18:10,430
I think people confuse Robbins standup
with his acting. Yeah. And you know,

1277
01:18:10,431 --> 01:18:13,670
Robin's interesting,
he takes acting really serious.

1278
01:18:13,671 --> 01:18:16,730
Like I think he actually thinks of
himself as an actor first, you know,

1279
01:18:16,731 --> 01:18:20,450
cause he went to Julliard and stuff like
that. You know, he's a, he's a, he's a,

1280
01:18:20,480 --> 01:18:23,990
he's one of the best actors in the
world. I agree. I think as an actor,

1281
01:18:23,991 --> 01:18:25,500
I think he's amazing.
I think,

1282
01:18:25,880 --> 01:18:28,340
I think he's better as an
actor than even as a standup.

1283
01:18:28,550 --> 01:18:32,420
I think he's just incredible. I
think photo booth movie, what?

1284
01:18:32,421 --> 01:18:36,710
It was at one hour photo.
Yeah, he's a, he's incredible.
He's, you should check out

1285
01:18:36,780 --> 01:18:40,440
the movie. He and I made,
it's a, he's, you know,

1286
01:18:40,470 --> 01:18:43,710
it was funny cause like before we
started to work on it, I was like,

1287
01:18:43,711 --> 01:18:47,650
is he going to listen to me? You know, and
I'm not going to say let's do this one.

1288
01:18:47,680 --> 01:18:49,470
Just do kind of mellow and uh,

1289
01:18:49,950 --> 01:18:53,100
oh is he going to say you
were in hot to try it?

1290
01:18:53,130 --> 01:18:56,790
And I have an Oscar so we're going
to do it my way. But that's not,

1291
01:18:56,791 --> 01:18:59,730
he never pulled any shit like
that. He was, uh, he was, you know,

1292
01:18:59,810 --> 01:19:02,760
we hope to keep Megan movies.
We'll probably do another movie together.

1293
01:19:03,110 --> 01:19:05,450
Do you feel free from police academy?

1294
01:19:06,830 --> 01:19:11,740
No. I mean, I know when I
die the, there'll be a photo
of me in a police uniform.

1295
01:19:11,750 --> 01:19:12,880
You know what I mean?
There's no way.

1296
01:19:16,870 --> 01:19:20,510
There's no way around it, but you
know, if people remember me at all,

1297
01:19:20,511 --> 01:19:25,400
it'll be that way. Yeah. Did you
ever have regrets? Um, yeah, always.

1298
01:19:25,401 --> 01:19:28,640
You know, but, but I don't, I
don't, it just took me almost,

1299
01:19:29,750 --> 01:19:31,850
it's taken me almost, you know, 25,

1300
01:19:31,851 --> 01:19:35,090
30 years to get where I am now and
now I make these small little movies.

1301
01:19:35,091 --> 01:19:38,990
I do stand up, so, you know,
to pay my rent and, uh,

1302
01:19:39,110 --> 01:19:40,160
I'm really happy.

1303
01:19:40,161 --> 01:19:44,330
So all the things that I would file
under regrets actually helped me get to

1304
01:19:44,331 --> 01:19:45,410
where I am.
You know,

1305
01:19:45,580 --> 01:19:47,890
when you're doing stand up,
do you ever,

1306
01:19:48,580 --> 01:19:51,200
are you doing it as you,
are you doing?

1307
01:19:52,090 --> 01:19:55,900
No, it's me now. I think. I'm like, yeah,

1308
01:19:55,901 --> 01:19:59,590
and I think like if I did do the
persona and some of the markets,

1309
01:19:59,591 --> 01:20:04,591
it would be more helpful
because a lot of the country,

1310
01:20:04,901 --> 01:20:08,160
it still is the eighties you know
what I mean? You know, if you say,

1311
01:20:08,161 --> 01:20:10,440
if you go to Kansas and they go,
oh,

1312
01:20:10,441 --> 01:20:12,690
the guy from police academy
and he's come in and,

1313
01:20:12,840 --> 01:20:15,690
but he's not going to do that voice.
Oh really?

1314
01:20:16,290 --> 01:20:21,090
Why do I want to go see that? He's
going to tell funny stories, you know?

1315
01:20:21,120 --> 01:20:26,090
But I think if it's like a poisons come
in and they're not doing every roses.

1316
01:20:28,200 --> 01:20:30,690
Yeah. So, uh, but you know,

1317
01:20:30,691 --> 01:20:34,530
it was a decision I had to make just
because I was back on the road and I was

1318
01:20:34,531 --> 01:20:36,000
like,
why do I hate the road?

1319
01:20:36,001 --> 01:20:40,620
And I thought it was because I hated the
wacky morning teams in the shyster club

1320
01:20:40,621 --> 01:20:44,990
owners and the shitty opening
acts. Sorry Brian. [inaudible].

1321
01:20:46,010 --> 01:20:49,930
No, no. I just,

1322
01:20:50,550 --> 01:20:54,720
I haven't even seen your standard. Right.
It was right there. It was just like, no,

1323
01:20:54,721 --> 01:20:55,554
but,
but,

1324
01:20:55,990 --> 01:20:59,970
but I realized I just hated doing this
persona that I had no connection to

1325
01:20:59,971 --> 01:21:03,390
anymore. You know, just because of
people's obligated. People were, you know,

1326
01:21:03,391 --> 01:21:07,230
wanted to see it. Did you drop it and
then go back to the same club like that?

1327
01:21:07,231 --> 01:21:09,600
You were there a year before and
they were like, Hey, what the fuck?

1328
01:21:09,750 --> 01:21:12,090
There's certain clubs.
I think definitely because you know,

1329
01:21:12,630 --> 01:21:16,000
what happens eventually is it, I think
it did affect my ticket sales, you know,

1330
01:21:16,001 --> 01:21:19,020
so there's a certain rooms I don't
work anymore, but, but you know,

1331
01:21:19,050 --> 01:21:23,550
I have to do what so I can hit
the pillow at night and feel okay.

1332
01:21:23,880 --> 01:21:25,320
Yeah.
Well it's,

1333
01:21:25,321 --> 01:21:29,100
and it's also the idea that you could
only be funny as our character. Silly.

1334
01:21:29,630 --> 01:21:31,860
You know what I mean? But
here's the thing, it's funny,

1335
01:21:31,861 --> 01:21:36,450
it's like back in the day on my early HBO
specials, there was material, you know,

1336
01:21:36,451 --> 01:21:41,310
I was doing stuff about the Iran contra
hearings and things like that in my act,

1337
01:21:41,311 --> 01:21:44,120
you know, eh, but, but
because of my persona,

1338
01:21:44,130 --> 01:21:47,790
people didn't understand that there was
anything going on in my act, you know?

1339
01:21:47,791 --> 01:21:52,140
So it never bothered me because I thought
it was a great way I could sneak my

1340
01:21:52,141 --> 01:21:56,640
message in. But in hindsight,
um, you know, sometimes,

1341
01:21:56,910 --> 01:22:00,800
sometimes I'll read something snarky
when I'm Ego surfing on the web and it'll

1342
01:22:00,820 --> 01:22:05,040
be like the guy for police,
you can, we believe blah,
blah, blah. And I'm like, gone,

1343
01:22:05,070 --> 01:22:09,960
dude. You watch those movies.
That's the only reason you're
mad, you know, I didn't,

1344
01:22:10,230 --> 01:22:14,490
you know what I mean? So, so
whatever, you know, I don't,

1345
01:22:15,060 --> 01:22:19,170
I don't let too much of it bothered me
because I'm so much into my own thing.

1346
01:22:19,171 --> 01:22:22,860
And, and the other thing is
funny is, is I'm not really
nostalgic, you know, I mean,

1347
01:22:22,861 --> 01:22:25,140
I,
I'm really always onto the next project.

1348
01:22:25,141 --> 01:22:29,190
I'm always riding after world's greatest
dad. I wrote five screenplays, you know,

1349
01:22:29,191 --> 01:22:32,130
so, and, uh, God bless
America is just one of them.

1350
01:22:32,131 --> 01:22:33,570
Should I just keep writing all the time?

1351
01:22:33,750 --> 01:22:36,060
Windy city.
He's one of my favorite movies.

1352
01:22:36,061 --> 01:22:40,570
And there was some talk for your time
too, to bring a second one around. Uh,

1353
01:22:40,890 --> 01:22:45,060
and I know there's a lot of fans of
like Perry and dawn and all that,

1354
01:22:45,070 --> 01:22:48,030
and they even have a pretty
successful podcast. Did you,

1355
01:22:48,031 --> 01:22:51,030
did you enjoy making this movie? Did you
ever think about making a s, you know,

1356
01:22:51,060 --> 01:22:51,960
a second one or,

1357
01:22:52,180 --> 01:22:55,650
um, only if, uh, uh, only if, uh,

1358
01:22:56,530 --> 01:23:00,130
if Perry was on board.
I think I, uh, you know,

1359
01:23:00,131 --> 01:23:04,270
obviously you can't do it
without him, but, but I, uh, the,

1360
01:23:04,330 --> 01:23:09,310
the idea doing another one, you know,
maybe I don't rule it out, you know,

1361
01:23:09,340 --> 01:23:13,070
it is, I do think it's, it's, uh, it's,

1362
01:23:13,170 --> 01:23:16,410
it's probably the funniest thing
I've ever been involved in. Yeah,

1363
01:23:16,450 --> 01:23:19,720
that's for sure. It had to.
Yeah. That's such a great cast.

1364
01:23:20,230 --> 01:23:23,680
Did you have anything, any of the,
are these a lot of your friends?

1365
01:23:23,681 --> 01:23:27,960
Like Dang Coco was in it. Did you
just do comedy standup with no, the,

1366
01:23:28,150 --> 01:23:29,800
it's a combination of
a bunch of different,

1367
01:23:30,310 --> 01:23:34,540
a bunch of different comedians
and their friends and, and uh,

1368
01:23:34,600 --> 01:23:36,070
and actors and stuff.

1369
01:23:36,670 --> 01:23:41,670
Rolling Polanski film that was
dramatic to dramatic people.

1370
01:23:44,500 --> 01:23:45,333
People don't know.

1371
01:23:45,730 --> 01:23:50,020
Can you explain the whole story behind
windy city heat or is that too much of a

1372
01:23:50,021 --> 01:23:53,230
giveaway giveaway?
I think people should just watch it.

1373
01:23:53,231 --> 01:23:57,250
I know people watch it and they
think it's fake. Uh, that's,

1374
01:23:57,280 --> 01:24:01,090
that's fine. You know, I don't argue it.

1375
01:24:01,240 --> 01:24:03,730
Kimmel doesn't argue that
either. You know, so, you know,

1376
01:24:03,731 --> 01:24:08,440
people just have to explore it on their
own. But I do know that I think it is, uh,

1377
01:24:08,620 --> 01:24:12,760
it's clearly, I think the funniest thing
I've been involved in. Really? Oh yeah,

1378
01:24:12,761 --> 01:24:17,390
yeah, yeah. A lot of people don't
know this is Perry on the left

1379
01:24:18,580 --> 01:24:23,510
and it's Don Berenson Moodle. Okay guys,
thanks a lot. I just call my agent,

1380
01:24:23,630 --> 01:24:27,830
you know, can make a
decision. Thanks. Okay. Hey,

1381
01:24:28,520 --> 01:24:30,980
Carson Daly. All right.
Yeah. Hi, I'm Don Burris.

1382
01:24:34,190 --> 01:24:35,180
Everyone's in on the joke.

1383
01:24:35,750 --> 01:24:40,530
Parents on the fanny pack in
the jackets were in the hat. Oh,

1384
01:24:40,660 --> 01:24:41,290
I'm looking at,

1385
01:24:41,290 --> 01:24:46,290
I'm looking at myself or somebody
that wants to be me and I'm saying,

1386
01:24:48,260 --> 01:24:49,970
and I'm thinking to my head,

1387
01:24:52,290 --> 01:24:56,670
this is somebody that needs
his ass kicked bad, real bad.

1388
01:24:57,270 --> 01:25:00,690
I
think he got the role.

1389
01:25:01,570 --> 01:25:06,340
They want to see one another guy,
some scary. So scary. Fairly.

1390
01:25:06,760 --> 01:25:11,480
Is that what you're calling
me, Perry Perry, I'm stolen.

1391
01:25:12,440 --> 01:25:15,260
Stolen.
Listen you later.

1392
01:25:17,680 --> 01:25:21,460
Did you ever worry at any point in time
that you're dealing with a crazy person

1393
01:25:21,490 --> 01:25:23,170
when you were doing this movie?
Got Embarrassed?

1394
01:25:24,080 --> 01:25:28,370
Yeah. I worry about that every
time I deal with that bear.

1395
01:25:29,920 --> 01:25:33,550
I love Don Baer. Yeah, I, uh,

1396
01:25:33,620 --> 01:25:38,490
I get to the other guy is a, is
a, is a great actor actually. But,

1397
01:25:38,500 --> 01:25:42,760
um, uh, besides being
a funny guy, um, I, uh,

1398
01:25:42,850 --> 01:25:47,610
uh, yeah, yes. Yeah, of course.
I mean, it's, it's, it's, it's,

1399
01:25:47,890 --> 01:25:49,690
it's really on the edge, man. I mean,

1400
01:25:49,691 --> 01:25:54,310
it was a really strange and uncomfortable
and scary movie to make. I mean,

1401
01:25:54,670 --> 01:25:59,470
it was really fucking weird.
Do you feel bad at all? No,

1402
01:25:59,471 --> 01:26:01,600
because Perry gets what
he wants and what's he,

1403
01:26:01,750 --> 01:26:06,230
what's he want more than anything is fame,
you know? Yeah. Right. But he's crazy.

1404
01:26:06,880 --> 01:26:10,220
Nice nights. No, I mean, you know,

1405
01:26:10,250 --> 01:26:12,720
as opposed to other comedians.
Yeah.

1406
01:26:14,850 --> 01:26:19,010
Let me tell you a little about stone.
He's a, uh, he's a hard drinking,

1407
01:26:19,100 --> 01:26:21,080
hard talking,
hard live in tough guy.

1408
01:26:21,710 --> 01:26:23,150
And we've seen a lot of
people for this role.

1409
01:26:23,151 --> 01:26:27,890
We saw Kendall Feeney Liotta and a Whoa,
pat.

1410
01:26:28,400 --> 01:26:30,680
We actually narrowed down the field,
uh,

1411
01:26:30,740 --> 01:26:35,300
to yourself and one other actor who we
just saw who was just walked out of here.

1412
01:26:35,360 --> 01:26:38,090
He was quite, uh, quite good. Carson

1413
01:26:40,540 --> 01:26:42,260
is a joke.

1414
01:26:45,880 --> 01:26:49,370
That's your painting
can do this role of me.

1415
01:26:49,880 --> 01:26:53,070
That's great. Wow. He's
crazy though. Are you ready?

1416
01:26:54,700 --> 01:26:59,650
And
Perry,

1417
01:26:59,720 --> 01:27:03,820
I, I'm sorry, a Lotta Lotta
Draegers. They say action.

1418
01:27:04,030 --> 01:27:07,470
I just said, and thank you.
So when you're hearing me say,

1419
01:27:07,960 --> 01:27:12,940
and you go,
and

1420
01:27:15,570 --> 01:27:18,000
my name is stone,
stone fury,

1421
01:27:23,380 --> 01:27:26,760
let him
very seriously.

1422
01:27:28,380 --> 01:27:31,380
I'm sorry. I apologize. I know
you're excited guys. We're just,

1423
01:27:31,440 --> 01:27:35,680
we're just getting into this key.
Please. Just step out. Okay. Carrie,

1424
01:27:38,370 --> 01:27:40,710
you get these guys evacuated
from this building.

1425
01:27:40,990 --> 01:27:44,660
They're gone next. I like, I
like what you were on that.

1426
01:27:45,720 --> 01:27:48,400
Okay. This is not gonna
make any sense. Yeah.

1427
01:27:48,420 --> 01:27:51,670
This is not for me right now.

1428
01:27:51,780 --> 01:27:54,720
People are not in a form is not making
any sense. I'm going to have to give,

1429
01:27:54,760 --> 01:27:58,400
can I give away a little bit of
us going ahead? The Guy Perry the,

1430
01:27:58,420 --> 01:28:00,480
they have him convinced that he's a star.

1431
01:28:00,510 --> 01:28:04,870
They make a movie around him and he's
just a crazy guy and he's crazy enough to

1432
01:28:04,871 --> 01:28:08,900
actually believe that he really is like
a movie star. He's The star of a movie.

1433
01:28:09,050 --> 01:28:12,070
[inaudible] city heat.
And so they, you basically

1434
01:28:12,160 --> 01:28:14,920
shoot a movie with him
and winked a crazy guy.

1435
01:28:15,910 --> 01:28:19,610
Everybody. Everybody. Yeah.

1436
01:28:19,640 --> 01:28:23,350
Everybody's in on the joke that he's
this movie star and Dog Barris tries to

1437
01:28:23,351 --> 01:28:26,620
ruin. Like, I mean Don Barrett's is pretty
much tortures him like he does well,

1438
01:28:26,621 --> 01:28:28,840
it's brilliant. The thing,
it's really brilliant.

1439
01:28:29,020 --> 01:28:32,650
Once you realized that this guy does not
know and then you realize what a crazy

1440
01:28:32,651 --> 01:28:37,651
fucking must be to let this go this
deep without like stepping back once and

1441
01:28:37,691 --> 01:28:40,030
going, hey wait a minute,
what the fuck's going on here?

1442
01:28:40,530 --> 01:28:42,850
Did you, I mean if
there's giant, you know,

1443
01:28:43,150 --> 01:28:48,150
trucks out front and everybody and you
have your parking spot and you'd drive

1444
01:28:48,211 --> 01:28:53,211
onto the lot and well he had to sign off
on those and know in the women love you

1445
01:28:54,240 --> 01:28:58,800
and he loves this movie.
But I mean when you see the movie,

1446
01:28:58,801 --> 01:29:02,420
it's really interesting because
immediately, you know, making demands and,

1447
01:29:03,030 --> 01:29:07,960
and bossing bossing his intern
around and so fascinating.

1448
01:29:07,990 --> 01:29:12,790
It's a, it's a, it's a onion that
never stopped peeling away. Seriously.

1449
01:29:12,791 --> 01:29:13,181
You know,

1450
01:29:13,181 --> 01:29:17,330
cause I showed it recently at all Lana
and people had questions and they said,

1451
01:29:17,930 --> 01:29:21,620
you know, that is Perry real. And
so I just called him on the phone.

1452
01:29:22,680 --> 01:29:26,340
It's like he's off and running.
You know,

1453
01:29:26,460 --> 01:29:30,560
what does Perry do to take care of
himself these days? I, you know, he,

1454
01:29:30,561 --> 01:29:31,830
he w he is a,

1455
01:29:32,030 --> 01:29:36,440
a sag extra,
he does show up in movies as a sag extra.

1456
01:29:36,441 --> 01:29:39,830
And for the longest time he worked in
his family's print shop that I heard

1457
01:29:39,831 --> 01:29:40,840
recently.
100.

1458
01:29:41,600 --> 01:29:44,040
So yeah,
I didn't know when he city

1459
01:29:44,380 --> 01:29:49,120
it's a, it, it's like I said, it's,
it's really a fascinating movie.

1460
01:29:49,121 --> 01:29:53,230
I mean, I, I can't say it's not
my baby because don and, and,

1461
01:29:53,231 --> 01:29:55,120
and mall and, and, uh,

1462
01:29:55,150 --> 01:29:58,930
Jimmy Kimmel and all these folks have
been doing this for about 11 years before

1463
01:29:58,931 --> 01:30:00,640
I got involved in directed this.

1464
01:30:01,030 --> 01:30:04,800
They had been doing this with the same
guy for years and they still do it today

1465
01:30:04,801 --> 01:30:07,500
on the big three podcasts
that Don Barris does.

1466
01:30:07,530 --> 01:30:11,070
So he's still thinks he's a movie star.
Oh yeah. They, they, uh, they actually,

1467
01:30:11,071 --> 01:30:13,440
it's even gotten crazier
now because if you're,

1468
01:30:13,441 --> 01:30:17,460
especially if you're a local La guy,
they have like people like leads mattress,

1469
01:30:17,461 --> 01:30:19,150
that guy goes,
we won't be beat.

1470
01:30:19,170 --> 01:30:22,500
He's now like a sponsor and
he's just a crazy person.

1471
01:30:22,501 --> 01:30:25,830
So you have this guy that you're used
to on the match or sky from the TV

1472
01:30:25,831 --> 01:30:30,180
commercials here now is somehow
part of this show and it's just,

1473
01:30:30,240 --> 01:30:33,300
it's amazing. It's amazing. You know,

1474
01:30:33,850 --> 01:30:37,540
Perry and you go, well Perry, here's
refrigerator Perry. And it really is him.

1475
01:30:37,541 --> 01:30:41,230
So I mean, you know, all these things
kind of made it easier. So when you say,

1476
01:30:41,231 --> 01:30:45,670
and here's our still photographer,
Ansell Adams, hello, Mr. Adams.

1477
01:30:45,671 --> 01:30:48,290
You know what I mean?
So why wouldn't it be ancillary

1478
01:30:50,170 --> 01:30:54,280
if I just met the real refrigerator?
Perry dude,

1479
01:30:54,281 --> 01:30:55,330
I can't figure it out.

1480
01:30:55,690 --> 01:30:59,470
I used to have backaches when I was
making the movie going. I was like,

1481
01:30:59,650 --> 01:31:01,540
this isn't same. You know what? You know,

1482
01:31:01,610 --> 01:31:04,170
I started thinking people were
filming me when I was peeing.

1483
01:31:06,110 --> 01:31:08,840
You started getting
paranoid and really crazy.

1484
01:31:09,200 --> 01:31:11,280
No sense of guilt whatsoever for

1485
01:31:12,980 --> 01:31:15,290
not now.
Not now,

1486
01:31:15,291 --> 01:31:20,110
but I know that he's very happy with
the outcome. When all said and done,

1487
01:31:20,111 --> 01:31:23,410
he's happy that again, it gave them a lot
of attention. Yeah, it still does. Right?

1488
01:31:23,870 --> 01:31:27,980
He got paid. He got paid very well when
he did it and stuff. So, you know, and um,

1489
01:31:28,580 --> 01:31:32,210
but, uh, you know what,
what's, I don't know, you know,

1490
01:31:32,360 --> 01:31:33,610
I,

1491
01:31:34,210 --> 01:31:38,400
Ooh, this is for the rest of my life.
I love it. I hope there's more bearish.

1492
01:31:38,410 --> 01:31:42,960
Never had a problem fucking clown when
the guy, oh, he's still, you know,

1493
01:31:43,190 --> 01:31:46,600
bears has his hand in like a million
different pots and now he does the Ding

1494
01:31:46,600 --> 01:31:46,811
Dong show.

1495
01:31:46,811 --> 01:31:50,650
We had podcast here the other day where
we had a live Ding Dong show and it was

1496
01:31:50,651 --> 01:31:54,700
the craziest thing I've ever seen
in my life. I was half what's alive,

1497
01:31:54,701 --> 01:31:58,080
Ding Dong show. He, it was dawn Barris,

1498
01:31:58,100 --> 01:32:02,750
a Iko Tanaka Jane, and they brought,
uh, uh, two other Ding Dong years,

1499
01:32:02,760 --> 01:32:06,070
schizophrenia surfer who's
a schizophrenia. We'd guy,

1500
01:32:06,071 --> 01:32:07,900
he's like smoking weed and,

1501
01:32:08,350 --> 01:32:12,280
and then you have a Tennessee I think
is his name and who's also from Tim and

1502
01:32:12,281 --> 01:32:16,810
Eric and Andy. They just pretty much had
a show. And it was the craziest thing.

1503
01:32:16,811 --> 01:32:18,580
I've, if you watch it, it's, it's,

1504
01:32:18,581 --> 01:32:23,350
it's like watching a train wreck that
you can't look away. It's amazing. Uh,

1505
01:32:23,351 --> 01:32:25,600
but yeah, it will be up on
death squad soon, but a heat,

1506
01:32:25,750 --> 01:32:28,420
don ha does the shit he does. You
know, like the Ding Dong show,

1507
01:32:28,421 --> 01:32:31,630
he has the big three.
He also has a, his band,

1508
01:32:31,631 --> 01:32:34,510
which is an air guitar band where he
has this whole band where people are

1509
01:32:34,511 --> 01:32:38,800
playing fake instruments that he does
almost every single night at the comedy

1510
01:32:38,801 --> 01:32:43,060
store. This guy. And he does open
up for Kimmel every single day.

1511
01:32:43,510 --> 01:32:47,000
Every single day. He, you
know, or whenever Kimmel has
it, she has the warm up here,

1512
01:32:47,001 --> 01:32:51,670
just the warm up. He is the most busy.
Don is a workaholic and that guy is,

1513
01:32:51,730 --> 01:32:53,760
you know,
fucking working every single day.

1514
01:32:53,761 --> 01:32:57,730
This is really good at tricking crazy
people. Yeah. It's going to be excellent.

1515
01:32:57,731 --> 01:33:00,130
I was going to be here Friday
for the desk would show Friday.

1516
01:33:00,160 --> 01:33:02,090
So tickets are available now.
I

1517
01:33:02,990 --> 01:33:04,850
Don Don barristers a motherfucker.

1518
01:33:05,150 --> 01:33:08,120
He's another one of those guys where I
never quite understood why he never got,

1519
01:33:08,780 --> 01:33:09,600
you know,

1520
01:33:09,600 --> 01:33:13,800
more recognition. Yeah. He's
a funny dude. But you know,

1521
01:33:13,810 --> 01:33:17,730
you're implying that show business
based on merit and talent and stuff.

1522
01:33:18,870 --> 01:33:22,740
I always hoped that someone
finds the good ones.

1523
01:33:22,990 --> 01:33:24,150
But I think that's a lot of,

1524
01:33:24,151 --> 01:33:28,860
it has to be a tenacity and your
ability to compromise. You know,

1525
01:33:28,861 --> 01:33:32,340
I think, I think those are the things
that really rewarded in show business.

1526
01:33:32,890 --> 01:33:35,680
Tenacity for sure.
The ability to compromise.

1527
01:33:36,610 --> 01:33:39,030
You mean do things you
don't really enjoy doing

1528
01:33:39,080 --> 01:33:43,360
to further your career?
Yeah. That can help

1529
01:33:45,380 --> 01:33:49,750
get help that money is, money is the
most important thing. Get some money,

1530
01:33:49,751 --> 01:33:52,600
then you don't have to worry
anymore. But do you, uh,

1531
01:33:52,720 --> 01:33:57,310
do you find money does make
you happy? No. No it does not.

1532
01:33:57,311 --> 01:34:02,020
But it definitely takes away the unhappy
feeling of being broke so it doesn't

1533
01:34:02,021 --> 01:34:06,670
make you happy. Yeah. And then, and
then, you know, my thing would be,

1534
01:34:07,030 --> 01:34:09,740
you know, do things for money
and then, and then below it

1535
01:34:11,360 --> 01:34:16,120
because it's so self destructive.
Yeah. So now I'm much happier, uh,

1536
01:34:16,210 --> 01:34:20,050
trying to kind of live a life that's way,
way smaller.

1537
01:34:20,051 --> 01:34:22,060
So I know some of my nuts not as big

1538
01:34:22,630 --> 01:34:26,140
think to not have to think about shit like
that. And then money, Mo problems. Well,

1539
01:34:26,141 --> 01:34:29,170
there's that to a certain
extent too, you know? But I,

1540
01:34:29,360 --> 01:34:33,280
I remember very clearly when I was young
when I first started making some money

1541
01:34:33,281 --> 01:34:37,030
doing stand up, like, like not having
to worry about paying my bills anymore.

1542
01:34:37,060 --> 01:34:38,700
I remember that feeling,
you know,

1543
01:34:38,950 --> 01:34:43,600
it was really when I got a development
deal from based on stand up for some

1544
01:34:43,601 --> 01:34:47,170
Disney thing and they gave me like a
chunk of money and I remember at, wow,

1545
01:34:47,180 --> 01:34:50,980
there's some money in the bank right now
I don't have to worry about now I can

1546
01:34:50,981 --> 01:34:53,920
stop thinking about my bills for a while.
Like it was a huge like,

1547
01:34:54,180 --> 01:34:56,970
well wait, what was the first thing
you bought? Like without like,

1548
01:34:56,990 --> 01:34:57,940
you know what I mean?
Like going

1549
01:34:58,400 --> 01:35:00,140
like, you know, like Jethro Bodine.

1550
01:35:00,150 --> 01:35:03,080
Like what was the first thing that you
just pointed at and said it's like a

1551
01:35:03,081 --> 01:35:07,730
massage chair. Hold those massage
chairs. Yeah, those are awesome.

1552
01:35:08,310 --> 01:35:13,070
Like a Barca lounger. They
had a, yeah, yeah, exactly.

1553
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:17,670
Yeah. Yeah. Really good.
The sharper image. Yeah.

1554
01:35:18,470 --> 01:35:19,980
Threw it away. No, no. I still have them.

1555
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:24,770
Actually the first things I got when I
got some money when I first came out to

1556
01:35:24,771 --> 01:35:28,990
California and I was on a sitcom. That
was the first thing. I got massage too.

1557
01:35:29,790 --> 01:35:30,660
So cool.

1558
01:35:32,090 --> 01:35:36,200
I remember sitting in one of them at a
mall and going, this is the most amazing,

1559
01:35:36,980 --> 01:35:40,690
the rich people live rollers.
Tappers it goes

1560
01:35:42,360 --> 01:35:45,500
down your bag. It's really pretty
awesome. Some day I'm going to be famous.

1561
01:35:46,040 --> 01:35:49,340
I'm going to get what I mean. The new
ones are even better than new ones.

1562
01:35:49,341 --> 01:35:53,810
They were in your arms go into cases and
it massages your arms and your legs and

1563
01:35:53,820 --> 01:35:55,460
massages your legs.
Yeah, it's really crazy

1564
01:35:58,100 --> 01:36:00,650
and grabs it. Yeah. You just have
to hope it doesn't go haywire.

1565
01:36:01,280 --> 01:36:03,710
Fuck [inaudible] earthquake happens.

1566
01:36:03,711 --> 01:36:08,260
Do you want to get the fuck out of there
and it's Howard crap with the flashlight

1567
01:36:10,160 --> 01:36:14,630
we met.
We've actually got completely full circle.

1568
01:36:14,660 --> 01:36:17,630
While you're screaming for help,
you think I have to throw this flashlight.

1569
01:36:17,660 --> 01:36:21,200
It's far away with possible so it
seems like we're not connected.

1570
01:36:22,600 --> 01:36:25,190
I'm going to go out.
It's throw it down the hallway.

1571
01:36:25,250 --> 01:36:27,080
I think that's the way to go out though.

1572
01:36:27,081 --> 01:36:30,920
I know people are always talking about
being afraid to be found that way. I say,

1573
01:36:30,921 --> 01:36:33,470
you know, whatever,
you're dead. It's over.

1574
01:36:33,471 --> 01:36:38,000
It's an opportunity for people to
make fun. Put a rubber fist in my ass.

1575
01:36:38,960 --> 01:36:43,760
You know? Even she even in favor of
faking it. Yeah. Oh, that's beautiful.

1576
01:36:43,761 --> 01:36:46,880
You're a team player.
Always. Always. Again,

1577
01:36:46,881 --> 01:36:51,140
I know the distance for the laugh.
You know what you gotta do. You know?

1578
01:36:51,310 --> 01:36:54,920
I would only hope someone with a sense
of humor, which fine me. Well, you know,

1579
01:36:54,921 --> 01:36:57,900
there was that video of the guy
who got fucked to death by a horse.

1580
01:36:58,370 --> 01:37:02,210
You've seen the video? I
haven't watched it, but I know
the movie zoo. Yes, exactly.

1581
01:37:02,211 --> 01:37:05,990
I heard you talking about, I was at
Sundance when that movie was there. Yeah.

1582
01:37:06,440 --> 01:37:11,440
After that guy dying that way and
that video being on the Internet,

1583
01:37:11,720 --> 01:37:14,690
that guy gave like a
huge amount of people,

1584
01:37:14,700 --> 01:37:16,930
a big burst of positive energy.

1585
01:37:19,700 --> 01:37:22,700
I don't watch it. I don't want
to be positive. I laugh, man.

1586
01:37:22,701 --> 01:37:24,140
This fucking something funny.

1587
01:37:24,141 --> 01:37:29,141
This is a guy and there's a guy helping
the Horse Dick in his ass and it's

1588
01:37:29,241 --> 01:37:31,860
ridiculous.
It's one of the most ridiculous trends.

1589
01:37:32,200 --> 01:37:36,680
How do you make that car go?
Hey, I want to fuck a horse,

1590
01:37:36,710 --> 01:37:40,910
but I'm going to need a little,
how can I help you? Well,

1591
01:37:40,911 --> 01:37:42,980
you're going to have to put the
Horse Dick in my ass. All right.

1592
01:37:42,981 --> 01:37:47,030
What time we had done it many, many
times is not good. I have a mini panic.

1593
01:37:52,530 --> 01:37:56,110
They did it. Yeah, they
actually to Seattle just

1594
01:37:56,110 --> 01:37:59,760
to, to do that. I think it's weird
that you can't watch jackass,

1595
01:37:59,850 --> 01:38:04,090
but you can watch that. That's quick.
It's really quick. So it's about the time,

1596
01:38:04,091 --> 01:38:07,190
you know, it's about, I mean I'm
sitting down watching jackass.

1597
01:38:07,191 --> 01:38:09,320
So committing to an hour and a half of,
you know,

1598
01:38:09,720 --> 01:38:13,830
soccer kicks to the balls and the
horses running over people and ah,

1599
01:38:14,280 --> 01:38:15,630
get anxiety.
But a quick,

1600
01:38:16,010 --> 01:38:20,460
have a quick clip of a dude getting
raped to death by a stallion.

1601
01:38:20,461 --> 01:38:24,120
Fuck that.
Fuck that.

1602
01:38:24,320 --> 01:38:28,260
Just first of all, if there's a guy
who's out there willing to do that,

1603
01:38:28,261 --> 01:38:30,900
you need to know. I just think you need
to know to put it in your computer,

1604
01:38:30,901 --> 01:38:33,780
Bank of human behavior.
This is the full spectrum.

1605
01:38:33,990 --> 01:38:36,760
You should know the full spectrum.
We shouldn't be shocked by it.

1606
01:38:37,790 --> 01:38:42,510
That's only the spanx from when they had
a camera handy. True. You know, I mean,

1607
01:38:42,600 --> 01:38:45,540
well they had a hundred hours of footage.
Well this is what happened.

1608
01:38:45,541 --> 01:38:49,650
The guy bled out. They drive
him to the, to the hospital.

1609
01:38:49,740 --> 01:38:52,950
The police said your friend's dad to
fuck what's up with all the hay and blood

1610
01:38:52,951 --> 01:38:55,710
around his asshole.
And then they confessed.

1611
01:38:55,920 --> 01:38:59,240
And so they had to explain what happened.
And on a technicality,

1612
01:38:59,250 --> 01:39:02,940
it wasn't really illegal because
they were living in Washington state.

1613
01:39:02,941 --> 01:39:06,540
And until this movie zoo came out,
when the movies who came out,

1614
01:39:06,541 --> 01:39:09,960
they changed the law.
That was what the actual take mean.

1615
01:39:09,961 --> 01:39:13,440
They had to have a fucking movie written
about the fact that people were moving

1616
01:39:13,441 --> 01:39:16,740
to their states specifically so
they can get fucked by animals.

1617
01:39:17,010 --> 01:39:21,860
So his death was a romantic
spat. It was a, uh,

1618
01:39:22,050 --> 01:39:27,050
a blip of laughter and happy that I should
smile at the feeling of if your life

1619
01:39:27,061 --> 01:39:28,450
is fucked up and you're,
you know,

1620
01:39:28,620 --> 01:39:31,410
credit card debt and you don't know what
the fuck you want to do with yourself

1621
01:39:31,411 --> 01:39:34,920
and somebody sends you a clip of a guy
getting fucked to death by a horse,

1622
01:39:35,250 --> 01:39:38,880
put it all in perspective. Do you go
before, that's what floats your boat.

1623
01:39:39,030 --> 01:39:43,640
It's not floating anybody's boat.
What it is is oh, W as watching it,

1624
01:39:43,641 --> 01:39:47,010
I'm talking about the guy who's doing it.
Like how do you get to that point? Well,

1625
01:39:47,011 --> 01:39:48,000
here's the other thing.

1626
01:39:48,060 --> 01:39:52,920
He also has piercings all over his
balls and this is why the related,

1627
01:39:53,040 --> 01:39:57,570
they think that people who get a lot of
like genital piercings and things along

1628
01:39:57,571 --> 01:40:01,920
those lines may be suffering,
not just from trauma,

1629
01:40:01,980 --> 01:40:05,460
childhood trauma,
which most likely there some of that too.

1630
01:40:05,461 --> 01:40:06,690
And sexual trauma usually,

1631
01:40:07,140 --> 01:40:11,400
but also that they might have a disorder
that makes it very difficult for them

1632
01:40:11,401 --> 01:40:15,530
to feel pain like a normal person.
So they try to get pain, right?

1633
01:40:15,570 --> 01:40:19,510
So they do things like pierce themselves
in very sensitive areas and you know,

1634
01:40:19,511 --> 01:40:21,000
a thing,
things along those lines.

1635
01:40:21,001 --> 01:40:25,440
And that might also be connected to
the idea of letting a horse fuck you.

1636
01:40:25,470 --> 01:40:29,370
It's like, you know what I mean? Like
they need like an extreme sensation.

1637
01:40:29,400 --> 01:40:33,750
They have a need for extreme sensation.
And that makes sense. That makes sense to,

1638
01:40:33,751 --> 01:40:34,500
to me,

1639
01:40:34,500 --> 01:40:39,240
if you just think about the variations
in behavior and people that you've met,

1640
01:40:39,450 --> 01:40:42,450
well I could see it being completely
haywire and being like that. You know,

1641
01:40:42,451 --> 01:40:46,740
that may ball piercings needs a horse
dick in his ass. It's this the spectrum.

1642
01:40:46,830 --> 01:40:48,990
And the guy was like,
the guy was like an architect man.

1643
01:40:49,170 --> 01:40:50,400
He's like a professional dude.

1644
01:40:51,060 --> 01:40:53,980
They probably have a lot of
qualities that are all together,

1645
01:40:54,310 --> 01:40:57,000
you know, like, like, or like when
they get married, you know, he,

1646
01:40:57,400 --> 01:41:00,700
the guy takes on the woman's last name
or something like that. Those same,

1647
01:41:00,730 --> 01:41:02,140
same kind of group of people

1648
01:41:04,220 --> 01:41:08,370
guessing that is some weak shit.
Look guys,

1649
01:41:08,380 --> 01:41:10,290
it takes on the woman's
now and that is some weeks.

1650
01:41:11,150 --> 01:41:14,500
It's a battle you're already
losing. Yeah, I saw, uh, some,

1651
01:41:14,501 --> 01:41:18,280
some reality show. Was it,
some guy did that recently?

1652
01:41:19,750 --> 01:41:22,680
I can't remember. Well, I
knew a dude who, uh, the,

1653
01:41:22,681 --> 01:41:27,681
the hyphen hyphen names or even worse
if he killed combine or you combine both

1654
01:41:28,181 --> 01:41:30,860
of your last name and last name.
Well that's, you know, that's our

1655
01:41:30,960 --> 01:41:34,710
mayor. You know, our
mayor in a, in California.

1656
01:41:35,010 --> 01:41:37,750
What the fuck is his name? Uh, uh,

1657
01:41:37,900 --> 01:41:42,040
go egg will Arlo wa I don't know
what the fuck is. His name doesn't,

1658
01:41:42,050 --> 01:41:45,310
it doesn't even matter does it? That's
ridiculous. But it doesn't matter what it,

1659
01:41:45,360 --> 01:41:49,230
his name is. His name was like,
okay, no, I have to pull it up.

1660
01:41:49,380 --> 01:41:54,150
His name was not a Latino name. And he
combined his name and his wife's name.

1661
01:41:54,151 --> 01:41:57,540
It became a Latino name. They
got divorced. He kept that.

1662
01:41:58,940 --> 01:42:00,770
What's ridiculous?
See,

1663
01:42:00,771 --> 01:42:04,490
that's the kind of person that gets fucked
in the ass by horse. Uh, did you ever,

1664
01:42:04,491 --> 01:42:08,460
I know Steve Martin, you said that
was one of your influences, uh,

1665
01:42:08,950 --> 01:42:13,340
for Standup, I guess. Uh, so, so was mine.
Uh, did you ever get to meet Steve Martin?

1666
01:42:13,341 --> 01:42:17,660
Did you have any cool Steve Martin
story? I mean, I guess, you know,

1667
01:42:17,661 --> 01:42:20,810
now if I see him, we, we will be friendly.

1668
01:42:21,200 --> 01:42:25,220
But the first time I met him I was
doing Letterman and, and he said, uh,

1669
01:42:25,610 --> 01:42:27,350
he goes,
Hi Howie.

1670
01:42:28,960 --> 01:42:33,910
He thought I was how I met. Oh. And
how he's a nice guy and everything,

1671
01:42:33,911 --> 01:42:37,690
but I felt like a Ming vase that got hit
with a ball peen hammer. And he's like,

1672
01:42:37,720 --> 01:42:42,610
Oh, I'm not, how are you man, don't.
Right. That's hilarious. Nice to meet you,

1673
01:42:42,611 --> 01:42:47,290
mark. No, I didn't say that back. So
you just played the role as Holly?

1674
01:42:47,920 --> 01:42:49,270
Actually,
I put a rubber glove on

1675
01:42:55,150 --> 01:42:57,790
Los Angeles. His name is Tony
Vlr. That's his real name.

1676
01:42:57,910 --> 01:43:01,310
He calls himself Antonio Villaraigosa.
Yes.

1677
01:43:01,440 --> 01:43:06,160
He completely Latino the fuck out
of his name. He combined his name,

1678
01:43:06,161 --> 01:43:07,150
but his wife's name.

1679
01:43:07,540 --> 01:43:12,340
And then when they got divorced he
just kept riding the Latino bull three

1680
01:43:12,341 --> 01:43:15,520
ticketless. That's cute.
That shouldn't be legal.

1681
01:43:16,540 --> 01:43:20,320
That seems like, that
seems like a, a hoax. What?

1682
01:43:20,770 --> 01:43:24,600
You shouldn't be able to just
change your name and, and, and, oh,

1683
01:43:24,601 --> 01:43:29,320
you mean for voters? Well, it just
seems like it's a, it seems unethical.

1684
01:43:29,321 --> 01:43:31,300
I know a couple of girls,
I want to change their names,

1685
01:43:31,780 --> 01:43:36,700
especially if it's your fucking former
wives name man. That's ridiculous.

1686
01:43:37,510 --> 01:43:40,930
Well I think it's weird when you get a
divorce and then the person's still keeps

1687
01:43:40,931 --> 01:43:45,220
the name that
it's less confusing,

1688
01:43:45,221 --> 01:43:50,140
but you know, well they
could do it forever to, they
can keep that shit forever.

1689
01:43:50,900 --> 01:43:52,010
Once they changed their name,

1690
01:43:52,010 --> 01:43:52,840
they just thinking

1691
01:43:52,840 --> 01:43:57,420
they can just rock it forever. It
should expire. Should totally expired.

1692
01:43:57,421 --> 01:43:58,254
It doesn't make any sense.

1693
01:43:58,840 --> 01:44:02,920
How could you be married for a year and
that woman becomes how many years you

1694
01:44:02,921 --> 01:44:06,750
were living with that person is how
long they could have your name. Oh yeah,

1695
01:44:06,810 --> 01:44:10,000
I was that. That's a good one. Yeah. Cause
you can hear you then. That's ridiculous.

1696
01:44:10,001 --> 01:44:14,560
It should be half the time. Get over it.
They shouldn't be. Yeah. I think, uh,

1697
01:44:14,620 --> 01:44:15,250
you know,

1698
01:44:15,250 --> 01:44:20,250
well for me alimony is crazy because
I'll be paying it until my ex wife passes

1699
01:44:20,741 --> 01:44:25,270
away or gets remarried. Yeah. Why? Yeah.

1700
01:44:25,390 --> 01:44:30,170
How's that work? Well, how
will you respond to me? Look
at me. I'm looking at it.

1701
01:44:30,171 --> 01:44:35,020
She had a fuck this. No, I don't know.

1702
01:44:35,021 --> 01:44:36,630
I mean, I think it's, uh, it's no,

1703
01:44:36,730 --> 01:44:39,850
but that sounds bizarre that people can
never get their life together without

1704
01:44:39,851 --> 01:44:43,780
you. Let's say you tainted,
she can't make a living.

1705
01:44:43,781 --> 01:44:48,280
There's no way it's impossible. I'm going
to hold up to Bob's Grad school after,

1706
01:44:50,170 --> 01:44:51,640
but it seems like,
you know,

1707
01:44:51,641 --> 01:44:55,030
like why should you be responsible
for her for the rest of your life?

1708
01:44:55,970 --> 01:45:00,100
More than other adult. Yeah. It's so
weird. Childish Law. Yeah. It's terrible,

1709
01:45:00,140 --> 01:45:04,600
but it's foolish, you know?
But, but when you get married,
you know, that's, you know,

1710
01:45:04,601 --> 01:45:07,330
you don't expect that you're going
to get divorced. So, you know,

1711
01:45:07,331 --> 01:45:10,540
you're not thinking about that. I mean,
I guess if you did, you were kind of,

1712
01:45:10,570 --> 01:45:12,340
I guess that would be healthier,

1713
01:45:12,370 --> 01:45:16,090
but it's also kind of a pessimistic
way to enter a relationship.

1714
01:45:16,640 --> 01:45:19,330
Laws is so preposterous.
It's just so ridiculous.

1715
01:45:19,350 --> 01:45:22,650
You should have to pay for
her forever. Like why, why,

1716
01:45:22,970 --> 01:45:27,970
why it did you take from her
her ability to make a living?

1717
01:45:28,101 --> 01:45:31,320
Did you take from her her ability to take
care of herself? Of course you didn't.

1718
01:45:31,550 --> 01:45:32,930
No, but I think it's, it's, it,

1719
01:45:33,040 --> 01:45:37,160
it stems from a very old timey
kind of thing. Like, you know,

1720
01:45:37,161 --> 01:45:38,850
when the woman stayed at home and,

1721
01:45:39,170 --> 01:45:43,610
and w weren't allowed to be professional
and get a job and stuff like that.

1722
01:45:44,540 --> 01:45:48,430
Yeah. It's, it's weird how many
shit laws like that are in place.

1723
01:45:48,970 --> 01:45:52,950
It's like whenever there's a situation
where someone can get fucked it,

1724
01:45:53,880 --> 01:45:54,550
you know,
and,

1725
01:45:54,550 --> 01:45:58,770
and you do see it like in the case of
divorces in like something like your case

1726
01:45:58,771 --> 01:46:03,070
where you have to pay someone for that
many years. It is very, very frustrating.

1727
01:46:03,071 --> 01:46:04,570
It's very frustrating to watch.

1728
01:46:04,630 --> 01:46:07,210
It's very frustrating to see
something that's not logical.

1729
01:46:07,570 --> 01:46:11,520
Well it's not logical, but you know, it's
like the old street joke, uh, you know,

1730
01:46:11,530 --> 01:46:14,080
why his divorce expensive.
Cause it's worth, it

1731
01:46:17,500 --> 01:46:22,500
doesn't fuck with your head that
you have to send alimony sometimes.

1732
01:46:22,751 --> 01:46:24,670
Sometimes when I'm like, you know, when I,

1733
01:46:24,730 --> 01:46:28,870
when I booked the gathering of the
Juggalos Oh did you do that? Sure. Yeah.

1734
01:46:30,030 --> 01:46:34,780
It's part of the alimony. He had to go to
training. I don't know. It's coming up.

1735
01:46:35,930 --> 01:46:39,180
You have your spinning training, you
could probably dodge still. Yeah, I, yeah,

1736
01:46:39,190 --> 01:46:43,540
I'll go back to the serpentine
serpentine. Holy Shit. Just sweet gig.

1737
01:46:43,800 --> 01:46:47,950
Wow.
And you think about that when you,

1738
01:46:48,060 --> 01:46:50,010
when you get those gigs.
Yeah. When you get a call

1739
01:46:50,010 --> 01:46:51,030
like that and you know,

1740
01:46:51,080 --> 01:46:53,850
and actually when I got the call
for the gathering of the Juggalos,

1741
01:46:53,851 --> 01:46:57,990
I didn't think of it as in money gig.
I was like, yeah, all right, I'm there.

1742
01:46:57,991 --> 01:47:01,620
Whatever man, this is going to be
awesome. That's gonna be crazy.

1743
01:47:02,670 --> 01:47:06,920
Why are you smiling at me again? It's
hilarious. I like taking gigs that,

1744
01:47:06,930 --> 01:47:10,950
that other people when I do enjoy that
for some reason, I don't know why.

1745
01:47:10,980 --> 01:47:12,950
Did you take time off of dual stand up?
Yeah,

1746
01:47:12,960 --> 01:47:15,210
I did for years when I was
directing the Kimmel show.

1747
01:47:16,080 --> 01:47:18,300
How much time did you take her off?
It was then.

1748
01:47:18,301 --> 01:47:22,320
It was probably about three years.
Maybe like about five altogether.

1749
01:47:22,720 --> 01:47:27,480
What drew you back in? It was, it was,
you know, going back and making a living.

1750
01:47:27,481 --> 01:47:32,370
Doing it was, was what, what drew
me back in. Yeah. I mean, you know,

1751
01:47:32,400 --> 01:47:35,610
I don't like putting that
out there. It's like, hey,

1752
01:47:35,611 --> 01:47:40,470
and now coming to the stage a guy, he
was only here to make money. It's bobcat.

1753
01:47:40,471 --> 01:47:41,970
Goldthwait phoning it in.

1754
01:47:43,260 --> 01:47:46,270
Did you feel like you're falling in
or when you actually just went on?

1755
01:47:46,750 --> 01:47:48,840
When I got back I tried to do comedy.
Yeah.

1756
01:47:48,841 --> 01:47:51,510
I mean I have a blue collar background,

1757
01:47:51,511 --> 01:47:55,170
so my whole thing is actually trying
to go out and do a show for people.

1758
01:47:55,171 --> 01:47:59,760
You know? I mean it sounds corny and
stuff, but if you're there to see me,

1759
01:47:59,761 --> 01:48:01,260
I've tried to work really hard.

1760
01:48:01,261 --> 01:48:04,680
Now if I ended up being on
a bill when other comics,

1761
01:48:05,130 --> 01:48:07,350
then I don't mind screwing around.
Do you know what I mean?

1762
01:48:07,351 --> 01:48:11,100
Like at a comic relief when I would
dress up as Christ and do magic tricks,

1763
01:48:11,101 --> 01:48:15,300
you know, water to wine, wine to water,
tap the deck and back to rice again.

1764
01:48:15,330 --> 01:48:18,780
You know, and I was the amazing
Christ out and stuff. But I mean that,

1765
01:48:18,781 --> 01:48:23,460
that's an example of me just having fun.
But, but if you come out to see my show,

1766
01:48:23,461 --> 01:48:25,620
I am going to work really
hard. I mean, you know,

1767
01:48:25,621 --> 01:48:29,040
you don't want to disappoint people
that actually paid to see you.

1768
01:48:29,140 --> 01:48:30,770
I, yeah, I feel the exact same way.

1769
01:48:30,771 --> 01:48:34,810
And I know what you're saying about it
sounds kind of Corny, but it's, it's,

1770
01:48:35,090 --> 01:48:38,360
it's admirable, you know? I
mean, that's the relationship.

1771
01:48:38,390 --> 01:48:40,040
That's how it's supposed to be there.
They're paying,

1772
01:48:40,450 --> 01:48:44,270
you want to do the best fucking
possible job you can to just,

1773
01:48:44,271 --> 01:48:48,490
the fact that you're asking people to
pay to hear you talk sounds ridiculous.

1774
01:48:48,491 --> 01:48:49,580
You've got to work really hard.

1775
01:48:50,940 --> 01:48:54,090
You worked really hard. But you
know, uh, my friend John Evans,

1776
01:48:54,091 --> 01:48:59,040
and I always say this is kind of
true, unfortunately in comedy, you're,

1777
01:48:59,050 --> 01:49:02,640
you're trying to keep the dumbest
person in the room occupied.

1778
01:49:03,120 --> 01:49:05,830
You know what I'm saying? And
that's why like when, you know,

1779
01:49:05,910 --> 01:49:08,880
I do like making these small
indie movies because you know,

1780
01:49:08,881 --> 01:49:11,520
the dumbest person goes to battleship.
You know what I mean?

1781
01:49:11,650 --> 01:49:15,550
Do you think that in this day in age
that that has to be the case though?

1782
01:49:15,670 --> 01:49:18,580
No, I think now that's why. That's
what's exciting about podcast.

1783
01:49:18,581 --> 01:49:21,760
That's what's exciting about, you know,
people are talking to their audience.

1784
01:49:21,761 --> 01:49:26,350
I think it's, it's great. Like some
people go, I think that, well, you know,

1785
01:49:26,351 --> 01:49:31,000
alternative comics are comics that just
performed for their podcast crowds.

1786
01:49:31,390 --> 01:49:33,430
You know, that's copping
out. That's, you know,

1787
01:49:33,431 --> 01:49:37,060
it's harder just to be a bar comic and
it's like, well what's the big deal?

1788
01:49:37,061 --> 01:49:41,650
Being in a bar comic, you know, making
every crowd again now if you can.

1789
01:49:41,710 --> 01:49:46,150
I never heard that argument.
That's hilarious argument.
If you make every crowd,

1790
01:49:46,840 --> 01:49:48,040
if can perform for

1791
01:49:48,040 --> 01:49:52,270
every crowd and kill, I guarantee
your act is about absolutely nothing.

1792
01:49:52,760 --> 01:49:53,593
Do you know what I'm saying?

1793
01:49:53,880 --> 01:49:56,380
I guarantee you there's some
puppets involved or something.

1794
01:49:56,460 --> 01:49:59,930
There's nothing wrong with finding
a crowd in the idea that you know,

1795
01:49:59,931 --> 01:50:03,680
you find your own crowd that's going to
soften you up. No Way. It's preposterous.

1796
01:50:03,760 --> 01:50:05,260
No, because that's like, if anybody,

1797
01:50:05,261 --> 01:50:08,230
interesting you ever watched
when they found their own crowd,

1798
01:50:08,231 --> 01:50:09,460
that's when they took off,
you know,

1799
01:50:09,461 --> 01:50:12,070
like prior or Bill Hicks
even or you know what I mean?

1800
01:50:12,071 --> 01:50:13,330
People who had something to say.

1801
01:50:13,690 --> 01:50:18,050
Yeah. Once you have people that they're
expecting you to be, you, then you're,

1802
01:50:18,060 --> 01:50:22,720
you're fine. You don't have
to, everybody's got their
own sense of humor, man.

1803
01:50:22,721 --> 01:50:27,400
And to to do so just have a show that
says comedy is like just having a show

1804
01:50:27,401 --> 01:50:29,120
that says music.
No,

1805
01:50:29,180 --> 01:50:32,950
not knowing if it's going to be Barry
Manilow or guns and roses or what the fuck

1806
01:50:32,951 --> 01:50:36,700
is going to be, you know? Yeah, exactly.
It's just weird that comedy is so,

1807
01:50:36,730 --> 01:50:41,620
it's so generic, you know, and it's
term. Well, it's supposed to be.

1808
01:50:41,621 --> 01:50:46,540
Yeah, but it's in its actual application
though, it's very, it's very, very,

1809
01:50:47,410 --> 01:50:50,920
and it's very personal. You know the idea
that like, well, I didn't like your act,

1810
01:50:50,921 --> 01:50:54,010
and then it's like, Whoa, you
know, I don't want to be rude,

1811
01:50:54,011 --> 01:50:56,680
but I probably wasn't
trying to entertain you.

1812
01:50:56,730 --> 01:50:57,950
That Holtzman gathered I was selling.

1813
01:50:57,951 --> 01:51:01,470
He was one of the funniest guys ever
that people don't know if I brought some

1814
01:51:01,471 --> 01:51:05,130
friends, the comedy store, and
they said, you were so funny, lol,

1815
01:51:05,190 --> 01:51:07,860
but I have to tell you that one guy,
oh my God,

1816
01:51:07,861 --> 01:51:12,540
he needs to give it up is just not funny.
It's so mean.

1817
01:51:12,541 --> 01:51:16,150
Exclamation point.
You went work.

1818
01:51:18,560 --> 01:51:21,050
I go,
okay.

1819
01:51:21,180 --> 01:51:24,930
Everybody's different when that twilight
lady sells a lot of fucking books, man.

1820
01:51:25,290 --> 01:51:29,550
Yeah, that's true. People like it,
you know, but to you or I, it's shit.

1821
01:51:29,790 --> 01:51:33,960
Would we want to read it? No. Would we
be angry if you wanted to talk about it?

1822
01:51:33,961 --> 01:51:36,660
Probably,
but it doesn't mean it shouldn't exist.

1823
01:51:36,830 --> 01:51:41,570
Well, that's the thing. It's like in the
new movie, you know, God bless America,

1824
01:51:42,470 --> 01:51:47,090
people go, well, this character, she just
turned off the TV and it's like, well,

1825
01:51:47,300 --> 01:51:50,900
if you try to avoid this stuff,
you can move. You would suck.

1826
01:51:52,140 --> 01:51:56,730
Turn the TV off and he doesn't
kill anyone. He says, ah,

1827
01:51:56,900 --> 01:52:00,830
I'm going to go read a book.
Go fucking movie one kid. Well,

1828
01:52:00,831 --> 01:52:02,210
that's the other thing.
People are going,

1829
01:52:02,330 --> 01:52:06,350
how could I do the Q and a and people
are going, they don't get caught, man.

1830
01:52:06,351 --> 01:52:09,590
They'd get caught. It's
a movie man. You know,

1831
01:52:09,710 --> 01:52:13,190
you know I wasn't going to have a scene
where I kept cutting back to Harvey

1832
01:52:13,190 --> 01:52:16,160
Keitel in front of a map going,
I got to get inside their brain,

1833
01:52:17,170 --> 01:52:19,160
kind of figure out where
they're going to hit next.

1834
01:52:19,870 --> 01:52:23,030
That would be funny if you did
do that though. Just a random,

1835
01:52:24,830 --> 01:52:28,490
that's the end of the movie.
To be continued.dot dot.

1836
01:52:28,920 --> 01:52:32,450
Kaytel looking down at a
map one day in the desert.

1837
01:52:32,540 --> 01:52:34,370
They seem to be killing reality stars.

1838
01:52:34,371 --> 01:52:37,760
Someone quick get over to
the Kardashians house asap.

1839
01:52:38,360 --> 01:52:41,810
I figured it out. That's
the pattern. What,

1840
01:52:42,110 --> 01:52:43,370
what does it look to you

1841
01:52:43,470 --> 01:52:46,220
to have grown up in an era with no

1842
01:52:46,220 --> 01:52:49,970
internet to grown up in an
error with uh, you know, doing,

1843
01:52:49,971 --> 01:52:54,860
stand up as a teenager with all these
like real comics to seeing shit like

1844
01:52:55,460 --> 01:53:00,460
reality stars to seeing Shit like the
Kardashians and Jersey shore housewives of

1845
01:53:00,861 --> 01:53:05,630
this, of that. What is that?
Is it freak you out at all?

1846
01:53:05,631 --> 01:53:10,580
Does it worry you about the, the course of
our culture? Well, I think, yeah, I mean,

1847
01:53:10,581 --> 01:53:15,370
uh, you know, it is what, why do,
what's the point of these shows?

1848
01:53:15,380 --> 01:53:19,850
What's, why are we fascinated? What, why,
why is it, you know, it's the coliseum,

1849
01:53:19,851 --> 01:53:22,250
you know, that's what we're doing
now. We're taking our week and,

1850
01:53:22,630 --> 01:53:27,140
and our dumbest and we're
making entertainment out of
them. You know, like Terry,

1851
01:53:28,400 --> 01:53:33,120
it was that bad. I said, well,
I mean, you know, maybe a,

1852
01:53:33,140 --> 01:53:36,560
and maybe you are what you hate. I mean,
maybe that's why I made the new movie,

1853
01:53:36,561 --> 01:53:39,950
you know, uh, Kimmel's that bad actually.

1854
01:53:40,190 --> 01:53:43,240
He said that frank would shoot
the people who made Wendy's,

1855
01:53:46,770 --> 01:53:50,310
but I think, uh, you know, uh,

1856
01:53:50,340 --> 01:53:54,810
I don't get as angry about them,
their success and stuff.

1857
01:53:54,811 --> 01:53:59,280
I'm more angry at our
appetite for the distraction.

1858
01:53:59,400 --> 01:54:00,810
Do you have an appetite for it?

1859
01:54:01,140 --> 01:54:04,890
I used to and I actually just like the
character about about four or five years

1860
01:54:04,891 --> 01:54:07,610
ago, I said, I'm out. You know, I'm
not watching anymore this stuff.

1861
01:54:07,840 --> 01:54:09,230
What were you watching?
I would,

1862
01:54:09,280 --> 01:54:12,450
I would watch the freak
show part of American idol.

1863
01:54:13,510 --> 01:54:18,010
And then I started feeling really
guilty. I was like, I'm out, man.

1864
01:54:18,630 --> 01:54:19,463
I'm out.

1865
01:54:19,630 --> 01:54:21,190
Yeah.
That was what was good about it.

1866
01:54:21,191 --> 01:54:25,180
What was good about it was
that it was terrible. And
then I said, I can't do this.

1867
01:54:25,181 --> 01:54:28,990
I go, I the, the, the, the,
you know, the little ting,

1868
01:54:28,991 --> 01:54:33,580
it takes out of my soul. I'm out.
Can you watch people bomb? Yeah.

1869
01:54:33,581 --> 01:54:38,020
I have no problem watching. Doesn't
bother you at all. It feels right.

1870
01:54:38,140 --> 01:54:42,040
Yeah.
I like watching people watching

1871
01:54:42,620 --> 01:54:47,220
shit is probably one of the few things
that entertains me in a comedy club. Yeah,

1872
01:54:47,221 --> 01:54:52,190
yeah, yeah. Wow. I have no compassion
for them. You know? I think it's great.

1873
01:54:52,640 --> 01:54:57,140
I love to watch someone eat shit.
Why is that? Because, because it,

1874
01:54:57,160 --> 01:54:58,550
cause here's the thing,
it's like,

1875
01:54:58,580 --> 01:55:02,540
here's something at one point that I
took really serious and you're trying to

1876
01:55:02,541 --> 01:55:06,350
think that it's just easy or are
you just thinking that is bombing?

1877
01:55:06,850 --> 01:55:09,710
There's have to be thinking again.
Again,

1878
01:55:09,711 --> 01:55:13,730
like a talented comedian bombing is
hilarious. You know what I mean? Like,

1879
01:55:13,760 --> 01:55:16,460
you know,
oh my God,

1880
01:55:16,461 --> 01:55:21,090
Kevin Meeney bombing is the funniest
fucking thing on the planet. You know,

1881
01:55:21,110 --> 01:55:26,090
I went to that and he's very animated.
Very funny guy. Best Kevin Meeney bombing.

1882
01:55:26,091 --> 01:55:30,470
I don't care about jokes. No,
go over. That's the Kevin me,

1883
01:55:30,471 --> 01:55:33,860
that's not even real bombing. He's
singing. He's telling a joyous time.

1884
01:55:34,190 --> 01:55:37,850
Real bombing is not knowing what's
coming out next. So what's next?

1885
01:55:37,851 --> 01:55:39,620
And you just eat it up there.

1886
01:55:39,670 --> 01:55:44,670
You can't remember your material and your
fucking mouth is dry bricks of shit or

1887
01:55:46,111 --> 01:55:49,860
tumbling out of your mouth. He tried
to pass him off as gold to the crowd.

1888
01:55:50,400 --> 01:55:52,160
It sounded like an Eminem Song,
man.

1889
01:55:52,161 --> 01:55:54,840
Over hyping every fucking
premise cause you're gonna.

1890
01:55:54,900 --> 01:55:57,570
This is the one that's going to turn
this set around. I'm telling you,

1891
01:55:57,571 --> 01:56:01,580
if you threw some beats to that Jag,
he just went on s and m and m's song.

1892
01:56:02,550 --> 01:56:05,300
I feel it. I feel it. You
know I'm from the street.

1893
01:56:06,990 --> 01:56:09,300
I'm from the streets now from every,

1894
01:56:09,301 --> 01:56:12,660
it's an everybody for one fucking
street who was from the prairie.

1895
01:56:12,700 --> 01:56:17,520
I'm from the colder sack motherfucker.
I uh,

1896
01:56:17,820 --> 01:56:19,590
I'm from such a New York bitch.

1897
01:56:21,060 --> 01:56:23,120
You were around when you,

1898
01:56:23,450 --> 01:56:26,360
you saw America pre and post crack too.

1899
01:56:26,600 --> 01:56:30,780
That's something people in their late
forties have seen something that most

1900
01:56:30,781 --> 01:56:32,970
people in this country
didn't know existed.

1901
01:56:33,180 --> 01:56:37,830
There was a pre and post crack period
and a lot of people aren't aware of that.

1902
01:56:37,860 --> 01:56:41,790
Like crime and cities and things.
Accelerated

1903
01:56:41,820 --> 01:56:46,400
drove salary. Yeah. And that was about the
same time that we dumped, uh, you know,

1904
01:56:46,401 --> 01:56:50,230
our mentally ill people out on the street.
It was the Reagan years. Yeah, yeah.

1905
01:56:50,270 --> 01:56:52,310
Do you remember when
Reagan was like the enemy?

1906
01:56:52,580 --> 01:56:56,570
Do you remember when everybody hated
Reagan? Now Obama's quoting him and stuff,

1907
01:56:56,571 --> 01:56:59,870
it's so weird. But Reagan,
you know, uh, you know,

1908
01:56:59,900 --> 01:57:03,050
I remember like when they dump the uh,
uh,

1909
01:57:03,080 --> 01:57:06,560
mentally ill and homeless folks on
the street, it was like a switch.

1910
01:57:06,590 --> 01:57:09,690
It wasn't like,
it was almost like instantaneous,

1911
01:57:09,950 --> 01:57:14,480
like totally different and
how, you know, so that's like,

1912
01:57:14,840 --> 01:57:18,890
you know, when people say, you know,

1913
01:57:18,920 --> 01:57:22,940
the way we treat the mentally ill
and our country, you know, it is,

1914
01:57:22,941 --> 01:57:25,790
we just choose to ignore them,
put them in movies

1915
01:57:25,980 --> 01:57:28,740
or you're not going to let
it go. All right. Yeah.

1916
01:57:29,100 --> 01:57:31,110
Because I've had people say
because of the new movie,

1917
01:57:31,610 --> 01:57:31,941
you know,

1918
01:57:31,941 --> 01:57:36,941
what if somebody saw and then went out
and killed people and you know I have two

1919
01:57:37,311 --> 01:57:38,480
responses to that.

1920
01:57:38,481 --> 01:57:43,481
One is if you could make people
killers by making movies,

1921
01:57:44,210 --> 01:57:46,670
the military would make more films.

1922
01:57:47,360 --> 01:57:51,590
And the other is if we're going to
start banning violent works of fiction,

1923
01:57:51,591 --> 01:57:53,880
we need to start with the Bible.
Those are my two bear.

1924
01:57:54,920 --> 01:57:58,930
Good. Very good one.
Yeah, it's ridiculous.

1925
01:57:58,940 --> 01:58:01,860
There are the idea that you can't
have violent fictions. It's fun.

1926
01:58:02,110 --> 01:58:07,110
Fiction is great and it's actually been
proven to instead of give people the

1927
01:58:07,341 --> 01:58:10,490
need to go and commit crime and
actually satiates our crowd just like,

1928
01:58:10,550 --> 01:58:12,800
like porn does for people porn,

1929
01:58:12,801 --> 01:58:15,890
like people that have access
to porn or less likely to rape.

1930
01:58:15,970 --> 01:58:19,390
It's like statistics that showed us.
But the thing is is

1931
01:58:20,200 --> 01:58:24,070
is if you, with the killers, it's when,

1932
01:58:24,130 --> 01:58:26,280
when people do do a Columbine and stuff,

1933
01:58:26,290 --> 01:58:28,990
it's easier to blame
Marilyn Manson then to look.

1934
01:58:29,260 --> 01:58:31,540
Those kids weren't even Marilyn
Manson fans. First of all,

1935
01:58:31,541 --> 01:58:33,550
it's just like some witch hunt and,

1936
01:58:33,551 --> 01:58:35,740
and the thing is is
whenever someone does snap,

1937
01:58:36,100 --> 01:58:40,030
there's always like Gabby Giffords.
You know, when someone's snaps,

1938
01:58:40,150 --> 01:58:45,070
that kid gave a ton of signs. It
didn't happen one day. He, you know,

1939
01:58:45,071 --> 01:58:48,580
the teachers didn't want to show up
when he was in his class and they have

1940
01:58:48,581 --> 01:58:52,090
security. So we have like
a whole ostrich, you know,

1941
01:58:52,091 --> 01:58:55,870
we stick our head in the
sand when someone's crazy
and just hope that they don't

1942
01:58:55,871 --> 01:58:59,740
snap instead of if you're on the left, you
want them to get help. If you're right,

1943
01:58:59,741 --> 01:59:03,250
let's say you want them to carceration
but the way we treat people who are

1944
01:59:03,251 --> 01:59:07,960
dangerous now with absolutely having no
policies at all is way more dangerous

1945
01:59:08,320 --> 01:59:10,270
than my goddamn movie.
So get off

1946
01:59:10,460 --> 01:59:13,670
Dick. Yeah, I hear you.
And those Columbine kids,

1947
01:59:13,671 --> 01:59:16,280
weren't they on antidepressants
or they're on something?

1948
01:59:18,470 --> 01:59:22,170
I don't know. I mean
I, I don't, I know that

1949
01:59:24,480 --> 01:59:27,230
them by antidepressants,

1950
01:59:27,950 --> 01:59:31,100
it's probably probably the
hottest kind of drug right now.

1951
01:59:31,130 --> 01:59:33,860
Call Him Barney antidepressants is,
imagine,

1952
01:59:33,861 --> 01:59:38,000
imagine living that town and that town
is forever attached to the fuck it is the

1953
01:59:38,001 --> 01:59:42,140
Columbine. Yeah. You could
say, don't go all call him,
buy it on. Right, right, right,

1954
01:59:42,141 --> 01:59:45,620
right. That's that school. That's
crazy. I mean that's that, uh, that,

1955
01:59:45,650 --> 01:59:50,610
that neighborhood forever attached to a,
yeah. They run into the presence. Yeah.

1956
01:59:51,650 --> 01:59:56,210
Well they say that like there's certain
modes of antidepressants that aren't

1957
01:59:56,211 --> 02:00:00,170
good for teens. Obviously that might be
a case. There's a lot of people, I mean,

1958
02:00:00,210 --> 02:00:02,610
the antidepressant thing is a very,
it's,

1959
02:00:02,620 --> 02:00:07,470
it's not an exact sort of a methodology.
They give him the,

1960
02:00:07,471 --> 02:00:09,980
on the gold, try this, tell us
how you feel and you could say,

1961
02:00:09,981 --> 02:00:12,440
I feel great and he's like, good,
we're going to keep you at this dose.

1962
02:00:12,440 --> 02:00:15,470
You can say, um, I'm just
not feeling enough. Okay.

1963
02:00:15,471 --> 02:00:19,010
We're going to crank up your dose.
Like think it's all based on you saying,

1964
02:00:19,011 --> 02:00:22,280
you know, how, how are we dealing
with this medication? This one sucks.

1965
02:00:22,281 --> 02:00:23,390
We're going to try something new.

1966
02:00:23,510 --> 02:00:26,480
I've had friends that have gone through
the three or four different medications

1967
02:00:26,600 --> 02:00:30,970
that tells me that there's
a lot of my exact, yeah. Or,

1968
02:00:30,971 --> 02:00:35,960
or friends who suddenly the personalities
gone, which is weird. Too Spooky.

1969
02:00:35,961 --> 02:00:40,370
That's like, yeah. I've seen people
like everything becomes okay. Okay.

1970
02:00:42,010 --> 02:00:45,590
You know, just started, they stop Karen.
They just doesn't, whatever they're on,

1971
02:00:45,591 --> 02:00:50,030
whatever. Which one it is to shuts
it all off. It's okay. Right now,

1972
02:00:50,031 --> 02:00:54,910
my camp peeps larue is on some heavy
shit. The cat is on. Yeah, she's a,

1973
02:00:55,310 --> 02:00:58,640
hopefully she'll be off of it soon,
but yeah, she's a little zonked out.

1974
02:00:58,670 --> 02:01:01,130
What is she on? I don't know.
Whatever we're given her.

1975
02:01:01,131 --> 02:01:04,130
Every once in a while she will find
them in the corner. She like, doesn't,

1976
02:01:04,131 --> 02:01:08,420
she spits him out. She's like,
Angelina Jolie curl interrupted.

1977
02:01:08,500 --> 02:01:12,510
I like peeps. Lou. It's spitting
out or antidepressants. You know,

1978
02:01:12,900 --> 02:01:17,720
cat tranquilizers are
actually a famous drug. Yeah.

1979
02:01:17,721 --> 02:01:18,554
Well what does it mean?

1980
02:01:18,570 --> 02:01:22,590
Yeah. Academy, but I don't
think she's on ketamine because,
because, uh, one of them,

1981
02:01:22,591 --> 02:01:23,311
my wife had it,

1982
02:01:23,311 --> 02:01:27,110
a syringe in her mouth and she got
some inner under government gone.

1983
02:01:27,240 --> 02:01:31,680
No. Hope it wasn't kicking
him. Jesus Christ. And, okay,

1984
02:01:34,140 --> 02:01:38,790
so you had to inject this fucking cat.
Well, you inject it in a, in a pill too.

1985
02:01:39,080 --> 02:01:40,010
Wow.

1986
02:01:40,070 --> 02:01:44,800
Inject your cat. Good fucking
luck. Why inject uh, uh,

1987
02:01:44,870 --> 02:01:48,380
the widow? Madeline paramin
gets her insulin twice a day.

1988
02:01:48,530 --> 02:01:53,420
You have a cat that needs insulin?
Yeah. Yeah. Whoa. Dude was 15 years old.

1989
02:01:53,450 --> 02:01:57,740
Holy Shit Man. I have a lot of
cats. How many cats do you have?

1990
02:01:57,800 --> 02:02:02,720
I have four cats, Jane. A lot
of cats. Joey Diaz has 11.
Oh really? That's a lot of,

1991
02:02:02,800 --> 02:02:05,030
oh, actually tag the is
about it. That's good. Oh,

1992
02:02:05,110 --> 02:02:09,350
Joey Diaz lives a two bedroom apartment
with 11 cat. Smells delicious.

1993
02:02:09,660 --> 02:02:13,280
It's beautiful. He says it cleans
the litter box every day. You got it.

1994
02:02:13,281 --> 02:02:17,960
That's not enough. I can, I got four.
I got four boxes. No waiting, you know?

1995
02:02:17,990 --> 02:02:21,720
Yeah. So two cats toolbox. W
what are your cats' names? Uh,

1996
02:02:21,770 --> 02:02:26,720
Oliver and Spazz spazz and wise fans was
that she's just, when she was a kitten,

1997
02:02:26,790 --> 02:02:28,310
shoes,
she would just run out of the room.

1998
02:02:28,310 --> 02:02:31,880
Like something was chasing her out of
nowhere. They're like clashing and things.

1999
02:02:31,881 --> 02:02:33,530
And she was always knocking things over.

2000
02:02:33,650 --> 02:02:37,860
She's 15 years old and she's
still asking a kitten. I, uh, I,

2001
02:02:37,910 --> 02:02:40,550
I probably am not so crazy about mankind,

2002
02:02:40,580 --> 02:02:43,430
but I haven't gotten a lot
of love for a little animals.

2003
02:02:43,940 --> 02:02:47,540
Every time I bring a cat home, my
wife's like, she goes, stop it.

2004
02:02:47,570 --> 02:02:51,710
She says you're the Schindler
of cats because you fight
cancer. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

2005
02:02:51,711 --> 02:02:56,330
Like squeaky Fromme. I had a dog named
squeaky Fromme. Yeah. Redhead. No.

2006
02:02:56,390 --> 02:03:00,860
Oh, she was a, she was a brown, but
he named her squeaky. Fromme yeah.

2007
02:03:00,920 --> 02:03:05,150
That doesn't make sense.
Squeaky Fromme had red hair.
Well, when I, when I met her,

2008
02:03:05,210 --> 02:03:09,050
uh, her, a voice was gone because she was
in the pound and when she was barking,

2009
02:03:09,051 --> 02:03:13,940
she lost her voice. Squeaky squeaky.

2010
02:03:13,941 --> 02:03:17,780
Squeaky. FROMME is because she'll
kill for me to feel for it.

2011
02:03:19,190 --> 02:03:21,460
I can tell it to kill. No, she, uh,

2012
02:03:21,480 --> 02:03:24,740
it's squeaky Fromme cause she's a dodgy
redhead that I found on the streets of

2013
02:03:24,741 --> 02:03:28,550
Hollywood. I didn't even know
the squeaky Fromme was a redhead.

2014
02:03:28,600 --> 02:03:33,590
I don't think I have, that was a wee bit
before my time, but she, she didn't act.

2015
02:03:33,591 --> 02:03:37,070
Did she actually attempt to kill no word.
No. Yeah, she tried to kill Ford. Yeah.

2016
02:03:37,430 --> 02:03:41,600
She wasn't on any of the creepy
crawly she wasn't on any of the, uh,

2017
02:03:41,630 --> 02:03:45,950
the Manson, uh, kills. She was
just, she lived at the spawn ranch.

2018
02:03:46,370 --> 02:03:47,203
And then,
uh,

2019
02:03:47,240 --> 02:03:49,880
I love the fact that I know all this about
her and I didn't know who the fucking

2020
02:03:49,881 --> 02:03:50,714
mayor was

2021
02:03:56,880 --> 02:04:01,770
it out. It goes Tonio of it. But uh,

2022
02:04:01,800 --> 02:04:06,750
yeah, so, so squeaky from Pete's Lu,
the, oh, the detective Carla Wisconsin.

2023
02:04:06,780 --> 02:04:11,160
That's the, uh, the latest cat and
they blamed all that stuff on, on uh,

2024
02:04:11,550 --> 02:04:13,530
LSD. Yeah, that's what
they blamed on. You know,

2025
02:04:13,531 --> 02:04:16,800
they blame this most recent Miami attack.
Did you see this guy a bit?

2026
02:04:16,801 --> 02:04:20,610
The guy's face off the white looking
animals. I did to see the photos.

2027
02:04:20,611 --> 02:04:24,190
Don't pull him up though. I don't show
them when you stream. How dare you. Um,

2028
02:04:24,240 --> 02:04:28,230
but the, um, the, there, the
police are saying that the
guy was on some new, crazy,

2029
02:04:28,231 --> 02:04:31,620
potent form of LSD. That's what
they're saying. But it's on Lsd at all.

2030
02:04:31,621 --> 02:04:34,210
It's this stuff called bath salts.
Do you know what Bass on?

2031
02:04:34,230 --> 02:04:38,220
So that's what he was on. Yeah, was
on bass off. It's, it's like a crystal

2032
02:04:38,220 --> 02:04:40,980
meth that you can sell
legally because they,

2033
02:04:41,180 --> 02:04:43,770
they modify one of the molecules.

2034
02:04:43,920 --> 02:04:48,900
So do you know like the for a long
time like bath salts, bath salts,

2035
02:04:48,930 --> 02:04:49,960
that's what they call it.
Okay.

2036
02:04:50,100 --> 02:04:52,770
They call it bath salts and they
can sell it in head shops and,

2037
02:04:52,780 --> 02:04:56,580
and in different places. But essentially
it's like a form of meth. It's,

2038
02:04:56,581 --> 02:05:01,440
it's really, and it's legal. See
if you have just one molecule,

2039
02:05:01,441 --> 02:05:03,660
something's different
from an illegal drug.

2040
02:05:03,750 --> 02:05:07,300
You can make like cousins that have
like very similar side effect or some

2041
02:05:07,340 --> 02:05:10,770
similar effects. And that's what
they've done. So they've is,

2042
02:05:10,850 --> 02:05:13,140
it's essentially like a
super potent form of meth.

2043
02:05:13,350 --> 02:05:17,760
And this guy took it and ate a guy's face.
But it does it make you,

2044
02:05:19,400 --> 02:05:22,760
does it make you hallucinate? I mean,
I don't know what the fuck it does too.

2045
02:05:22,930 --> 02:05:27,590
Obviously gas is a roast.
I think he just went fucking crazy.

2046
02:05:27,591 --> 02:05:28,360
I just think you were

2047
02:05:28,360 --> 02:05:30,280
absolutely crazy.
There was another guy,

2048
02:05:30,281 --> 02:05:35,200
I think that was unmet that cuts
some guys hard out recently. Yeah.

2049
02:05:35,500 --> 02:05:37,510
I think,
I think some people,

2050
02:05:37,511 --> 02:05:41,680
you get the right mind with the right
substance and they just completely lose

2051
02:05:41,681 --> 02:05:42,310
their shit.

2052
02:05:42,310 --> 02:05:46,150
But this guy who is eating the face, he
kept eating the face. That's why I to use.

2053
02:05:46,151 --> 02:05:49,450
Where are they? I mean he was, he was,
he's the guy, his whole face. You saw it,

2054
02:05:49,451 --> 02:05:52,120
right? Like people bite all
the time and the fighting. But,

2055
02:05:52,121 --> 02:05:55,990
but the fact that he was swallowing
and then went back for more,

2056
02:05:56,020 --> 02:05:58,810
he ate the guy's face. He held him
down, he ate his nose, you know,

2057
02:05:58,811 --> 02:06:02,800
and the guy was screaming and writing.
The guy was not unconscious.

2058
02:06:02,980 --> 02:06:05,890
I was conscious the whole
time he made his face.

2059
02:06:05,920 --> 02:06:08,690
He was conscious while the guy whose
face that silence of the lambs.

2060
02:06:08,860 --> 02:06:12,390
Yeah. And the guy, I mean he ate
his whole face or people don't know.

2061
02:06:12,400 --> 02:06:15,900
I mean these entire front of his
face is missing. His nose is missing.

2062
02:06:15,930 --> 02:06:18,660
His eyebrows are missing. The
guy just, it took a while.

2063
02:06:18,661 --> 02:06:21,360
The guy ate him for a while.
It's really incredible.

2064
02:06:21,580 --> 02:06:26,140
Mrs This guy part chimp.
Oh No, just a regular dude.
Well, we were all part chimp,

2065
02:06:26,141 --> 02:06:28,870
Bob. Apparently this,
you believe in the Bible.

2066
02:06:29,210 --> 02:06:31,210
We're all part of chimp apparently.

2067
02:06:31,211 --> 02:06:35,820
If you give me a red wine and
a bath salts and bath salts,

2068
02:06:35,830 --> 02:06:38,380
I might bite your face.
Yeah.

2069
02:06:38,381 --> 02:06:41,470
That's a wonder if this guy is
a squeaky clean record. Who?

2070
02:06:41,471 --> 02:06:45,260
The guy who bit the by
stuff. Here's his face. Now

2071
02:06:48,510 --> 02:06:53,510
for the folks who didn't want to
see that face and I didn't eat it,

2072
02:06:53,980 --> 02:06:57,400
I've seen it already. Oh, you saw
it. Sometimes I listen to the show.

2073
02:06:57,401 --> 02:07:00,310
I'm surprised and stuff that
you will watch and look at

2074
02:07:02,140 --> 02:07:04,180
things that are violent. You'll
say, hey, check this out.

2075
02:07:04,181 --> 02:07:07,120
There's a guy who gets his arm
ripped off or whatever. You know?

2076
02:07:10,070 --> 02:07:12,540
We'll look at them like tigers in a zoo.
Yeah.

2077
02:07:12,550 --> 02:07:16,270
Someone getting reaches in and take
a picture. Post hole fucking arm off.

2078
02:07:16,600 --> 02:07:17,433
I saw that video.

2079
02:07:18,610 --> 02:07:21,770
I like those videos and then
you play Yakety sax under him.

2080
02:07:22,540 --> 02:07:24,190
What's the Acne Benny Hill thing

2081
02:07:26,590 --> 02:07:31,120
makes anything funny. Getting your
arm ripped off at the zoo. Oh,

2082
02:07:31,750 --> 02:07:36,010
fucking silly. But again, the
guy who we have the guy reach in

2083
02:07:36,040 --> 02:07:37,120
or did the line just,

2084
02:07:37,210 --> 02:07:39,710
just grab a few of them out there?
There's a few videos.

2085
02:07:39,730 --> 02:07:42,400
I mean it an individual circumstances.
I think a lot of them,

2086
02:07:42,401 --> 02:07:46,840
when the guys were reaching in trying
to take pictures. Okay. One of them,

2087
02:07:46,841 --> 02:07:51,040
a guy got to close that he sat with his
back to the lions and so that they can

2088
02:07:51,041 --> 02:07:54,600
take a photo of him in the
lion's reach through Tim.

2089
02:07:54,910 --> 02:07:56,290
And as they pulled him close,

2090
02:07:56,291 --> 02:07:58,870
they bid him and then they got his arm
through and they just ripped his arm off

2091
02:07:58,871 --> 02:08:03,820
his body. Wow. Youtube.
Well a couple of them,

2092
02:08:03,850 --> 02:08:05,530
some of them were on live leak.

2093
02:08:05,560 --> 02:08:08,490
They're on different webs is like
they'll find them on youtube and they'll

2094
02:08:08,491 --> 02:08:09,950
remove them because they're so gorgeous.

2095
02:08:10,270 --> 02:08:13,720
There's so many things that are so
gory that I don't want him in my head.

2096
02:08:13,870 --> 02:08:17,230
You know what I mean?
And I know that when the Alzheimer's

2097
02:08:17,280 --> 02:08:20,130
kicks in, that will be the only
thing that'll be in a loop.

2098
02:08:20,131 --> 02:08:25,131
And last screen saver on my screen saver
will beat a guy getting his nuts chewed

2099
02:08:25,171 --> 02:08:29,550
up by tag or, and you know, I do
know that like when I'm senile,

2100
02:08:29,580 --> 02:08:33,360
like two girls and one cup is going to
be the only thing I can remember and

2101
02:08:33,361 --> 02:08:35,100
they'll be like,
let's not go see grandpa.

2102
02:08:35,101 --> 02:08:37,530
He just talks about girls
pooping and drinking it.

2103
02:08:38,880 --> 02:08:42,630
It's amazing that things like two girls,
one cup can be that viral.

2104
02:08:42,840 --> 02:08:45,660
That's something can literally hit and
millions and millions and millions of

2105
02:08:45,661 --> 02:08:49,800
eyes. Actually something like
that is what will cause world

2106
02:08:49,870 --> 02:08:54,370
piece. Or as you say, the hundredth
monkey, you know it will be two girls,

2107
02:08:54,371 --> 02:08:56,950
one cup. That'll be the universal. Yeah,

2108
02:08:56,951 --> 02:09:01,000
because it transcends nationalities
and that's where it starts.

2109
02:09:01,180 --> 02:09:02,580
That's where the revolution started.

2110
02:09:03,030 --> 02:09:06,470
I realize we're all the same cause
we're 100 million people have seen this

2111
02:09:06,471 --> 02:09:09,640
because we're laughing at the same
thing because we are not laughing,

2112
02:09:09,641 --> 02:09:14,641
but we all have the same reaction that
may stop wars that may turn everything

2113
02:09:14,651 --> 02:09:15,484
around.

2114
02:09:15,720 --> 02:09:17,100
Not everybody has the same reaction.

2115
02:09:17,101 --> 02:09:20,370
Some people were probably
beating off to that. Right.

2116
02:09:21,460 --> 02:09:25,440
I mean there's a reason why there's that
shit, that shit porn is out there, right,

2117
02:09:25,720 --> 02:09:29,610
Jack? Yeah. Do they beat off to
this? People are beating off the,

2118
02:09:29,611 --> 02:09:32,050
that face pic of that guy,
that Zombie guy.

2119
02:09:32,190 --> 02:09:36,270
Mm. Maybe. Maybe they are. It's probably
two people at least. Sure. That you,

2120
02:09:36,271 --> 02:09:37,500
if you could think it,

2121
02:09:37,501 --> 02:09:41,200
someone's doing that Japanese guy cut
his dick off and served it to booth,

2122
02:09:42,210 --> 02:09:45,800
you would say, no way. Just when we were
kids, you would say, no way. You know,

2123
02:09:45,840 --> 02:09:48,180
in the 1980s you'd say,
no, no one's doing that.

2124
02:09:48,210 --> 02:09:51,090
No one's cutting the dick off and
serving it. That's an urban myth.

2125
02:09:51,390 --> 02:09:54,890
But they are kind of wine. Do you serve
with that? I would say a white wine.

2126
02:09:54,900 --> 02:09:58,650
White wine. A lusty red wine.
What do you have? No Dick.

2127
02:09:58,710 --> 02:10:02,190
Now, if it was two buck, fuck
now if it was a woman's genitals,

2128
02:10:02,310 --> 02:10:07,060
it's definitely a fish. Yeah. Right.
So that would be a white wine. Dairy.

2129
02:10:07,690 --> 02:10:12,510
Well, it's an eel. An Eel. You would have
white wine with eal. How's your cock?

2130
02:10:12,540 --> 02:10:15,540
It's good. No, I really don't know.
You didn't eat all of it? I know.

2131
02:10:15,541 --> 02:10:20,130
Here's the thing, I just,
my eyes are bigger than my
stomach when I came in here.

2132
02:10:20,190 --> 02:10:22,830
Imagine if you had to throw some of his
cock in the garbage because he didn't

2133
02:10:22,831 --> 02:10:26,820
finish it. No one finished it. Reheating
the cock in the microwave the next day.

2134
02:10:26,870 --> 02:10:27,990
Don't take it so hard.

2135
02:10:29,190 --> 02:10:31,530
Awesome. Legal. How are you
allowed to serve people?

2136
02:10:31,950 --> 02:10:34,250
Human food now food

2137
02:10:34,250 --> 02:10:37,100
here. When she serve yourself?
I guess maybe it doesn't matter.

2138
02:10:37,120 --> 02:10:41,990
Is that the loophole for cannibalism?
I guess? I guess if you eat yourself,

2139
02:10:42,410 --> 02:10:42,711
I mean,

2140
02:10:42,711 --> 02:10:46,400
what's the difference between that and
when you chew the skin on your fingers?

2141
02:10:46,401 --> 02:10:47,234
Yeah,

2142
02:10:47,310 --> 02:10:51,360
my hair. Oh yeah, but that's if
you eat yourself. Who the fuck?

2143
02:10:51,361 --> 02:10:55,960
What kind of fucking doctor
moved that guy's cock? Where?

2144
02:10:55,980 --> 02:10:57,960
Where in hippocratic oath.

2145
02:10:58,050 --> 02:11:02,960
It was the same doctor that did
Kanye west mother's a lifeboat. Oh.

2146
02:11:04,420 --> 02:11:08,470
Oh, oh, oh no.

2147
02:11:11,100 --> 02:11:14,010
Oh no he didn't.
Well,

2148
02:11:14,011 --> 02:11:18,950
I mean what kind of doctor you said
like one out of a hot dick and that's

2149
02:11:18,970 --> 02:11:22,500
someone in a top notch hospital is
what I'm saying. That's not a doctor.

2150
02:11:22,560 --> 02:11:27,540
I mean a doctor supposed to. That's like
against the less in Japan is different.

2151
02:11:27,810 --> 02:11:29,660
Maybe they felt that this,

2152
02:11:29,661 --> 02:11:34,530
this guy probably hit some sort of mental
disorder that felt that his penis was

2153
02:11:34,531 --> 02:11:39,180
holding him back. So this guy was
helping them by removing his penis.

2154
02:11:39,660 --> 02:11:42,690
He said he was asexual.
You know that he does not,

2155
02:11:42,720 --> 02:11:45,900
not that he's not male or not female,
but both.

2156
02:11:45,930 --> 02:11:49,650
But what he meant was that he
has no desire for sex, nothing.

2157
02:11:49,680 --> 02:11:53,790
And then he had no need for his junk.
That's probably like abuse. Right?

2158
02:11:53,850 --> 02:11:57,350
Wouldn't you assume?
I'm guessing this guy was in his 50s no,

2159
02:11:58,070 --> 02:12:00,810
22 and you're done.
You're over your joining too.

2160
02:12:01,020 --> 02:12:03,400
Wow. Yeah. Wow. Yeah.

2161
02:12:04,620 --> 02:12:06,600
What kind of chef are you at?
22

2162
02:12:08,430 --> 02:12:10,810
currently didn't go to one
of the finer colon area.

2163
02:12:10,910 --> 02:12:13,070
Gave you a dick for later
when you're really good.

2164
02:12:13,680 --> 02:12:16,740
Yeah. When you know what you're
doing. Oh, I should have t boned it.

2165
02:12:17,160 --> 02:12:18,390
I should've butterflied it.

2166
02:12:20,310 --> 02:12:25,290
Now the way the sauce that I use now with
Kakuma, oh my goodness. Cock and balls,

2167
02:12:25,590 --> 02:12:28,830
everybody, all they said was they could
taste the butter. That's all they tasted.

2168
02:12:29,010 --> 02:12:30,910
There is no fenna get some moly.

2169
02:12:32,910 --> 02:12:35,190
Removes Cock fish sticks in his mouth.

2170
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:39,150
This poor fucking guy, man. I mean,

2171
02:12:39,151 --> 02:12:43,750
just thinking of what a ridiculous idea
that is. The how years later. Well,

2172
02:12:44,160 --> 02:12:47,820
well, think about what you did in your
youth and then you, you know, I mean,

2173
02:12:48,210 --> 02:12:51,900
I mean now I don't feel bad about being
in police academy two and three and four.

2174
02:12:53,450 --> 02:12:54,730
I didn't cut my cock off

2175
02:12:54,920 --> 02:12:59,450
service. Yeah, this guy,
he had this, oh my God,

2176
02:12:59,451 --> 02:13:04,370
there's photos of it. Oh my
God, Dude. Okay. Heart chaos.

2177
02:13:04,371 --> 02:13:07,470
Go to Heart K. I'm not going to see
that. I don't care. Well it's, it's,

2178
02:13:07,480 --> 02:13:11,840
it's like Google has tapas food. I don't
want to see it. All right. Just Google it.

2179
02:13:12,860 --> 02:13:16,010
Need to look out. But he got it to look
exactly like, I don't want to see it.

2180
02:13:16,210 --> 02:13:19,850
Like if I get awesome boiled or
was it cooked? It looks like,

2181
02:13:20,210 --> 02:13:23,950
I don't want to tell you man. He's
slicing it up. It's hard core.

2182
02:13:24,010 --> 02:13:26,640
So it's like Shashimi oh,

2183
02:13:26,660 --> 02:13:30,560
it's cooks to cook Dick and
balls. This is horrific, man.

2184
02:13:30,561 --> 02:13:35,561
This guy is fucking Dick and balls off
and made people eat it and who's eating

2185
02:13:35,581 --> 02:13:36,870
it?
A bunch of people,

2186
02:13:37,070 --> 02:13:41,040
I think a lot about a lot of money per
per a table and now they're all in the

2187
02:13:41,041 --> 02:13:45,900
same frat. Oh, scary. It's pledge week,

2188
02:13:45,970 --> 02:13:50,430
motherfucker.
I just,

2189
02:13:50,670 --> 02:13:52,050
you know,
I would love to

2190
02:13:53,750 --> 02:13:55,670
just talk to the guy.

2191
02:13:56,550 --> 02:14:01,290
You sure man, let's,
let's think this over.

2192
02:14:01,620 --> 02:14:03,930
Even if you, you know, you
don't want to have sex anymore.

2193
02:14:03,931 --> 02:14:05,310
You don't have to remove your deck.

2194
02:14:05,870 --> 02:14:10,200
Like you could just not
upset an angry breakup. Yeah.
That's a really angry break.

2195
02:14:10,470 --> 02:14:14,250
His Dick did something. He's
like saying, you know, fuck you.

2196
02:14:14,400 --> 02:14:16,920
I'm going to eat my dick now.
Wow.

2197
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:19,620
There's no laws against cannibalism

2198
02:14:20,740 --> 02:14:21,573
in Japan.

2199
02:14:22,910 --> 02:14:27,710
As long as you acquire that.
I'm guessing so you could like,

2200
02:14:27,711 --> 02:14:31,880
if someone donated their body when they
died, you could eat it. I guess you could.

2201
02:14:32,420 --> 02:14:35,240
Yeah. Jesus. So still frightening.

2202
02:14:36,560 --> 02:14:40,760
This is something crazy days.
After his 22nd birthday,

2203
02:14:41,570 --> 02:14:46,040
the artist's underwent elective general
removal surgery divided up to separate

2204
02:14:46,041 --> 02:14:51,020
penis shaft testicles and scrotal skin
between five people and garnished it with

2205
02:14:51,021 --> 02:14:52,940
button mushrooms and Italian Parsley.

2206
02:14:53,120 --> 02:14:58,120
I want that guy literally made people
eat his Dick Button mushrooms bold.

2207
02:14:59,210 --> 02:15:03,800
I would want would like an asparagus.
Wow. This is the spectrum, man.

2208
02:15:03,890 --> 02:15:06,080
This fits right in the spectrum.
There's no,

2209
02:15:06,081 --> 02:15:09,500
but I mean that's the bottom
or top of the spectrum,

2210
02:15:09,501 --> 02:15:12,020
whichever way you want to go.
You really think so.

2211
02:15:12,021 --> 02:15:14,570
I think the bottom is people
eating other people's dicks.

2212
02:15:14,571 --> 02:15:17,900
You think things have gotten
any weirder? I don't. I think,

2213
02:15:17,930 --> 02:15:19,670
I think we just now know about it.

2214
02:15:19,700 --> 02:15:23,300
I can't get exposure to different things.

2215
02:15:23,301 --> 02:15:28,301
It's certainly jaded people and it's
certainly reflected in porn and porn is

2216
02:15:28,341 --> 02:15:31,610
where people are naked and you
know seeking pleasure. Right? Well,

2217
02:15:31,611 --> 02:15:32,570
when you look at Porn,

2218
02:15:32,571 --> 02:15:36,980
you can see a clear change between the
way people were before the Internet and

2219
02:15:36,981 --> 02:15:41,170
the way people are after the Internet.
First of all, the porn industry vanished.

2220
02:15:41,290 --> 02:15:44,150
There is no industry anymore. It's
all like free stuff. It's all,

2221
02:15:44,151 --> 02:15:47,690
everything's online. It's free. Like very
few people are paying for it much less.

2222
02:15:48,110 --> 02:15:50,230
And second of all,
it's fucking violent man.

2223
02:15:50,240 --> 02:15:55,240
A lot of it is like choking and slapping
and gagging and an opening up your

2224
02:15:55,851 --> 02:15:59,390
eyelids and shooting Lowe's into
your eyes and shooting lows,

2225
02:15:59,410 --> 02:16:01,100
the glasses and making you drink.

2226
02:16:01,450 --> 02:16:05,580
Tell you I'm watching more than I've
ever paid for my life because of a web

2227
02:16:05,581 --> 02:16:08,970
webcams. Well yeah, but you're a, you're
a broken man. They're just more crazy.

2228
02:16:09,430 --> 02:16:13,330
[inaudible] you pay for web
cams. That's what you're
doing. Tipping girls. Oh, okay.

2229
02:16:13,331 --> 02:16:17,120
So you like getting on Webcam with
them? Well No, no. I may see you.

2230
02:16:17,180 --> 02:16:21,250
There's websites we've talked about before
where you just sit there and you know,

2231
02:16:21,350 --> 02:16:23,330
they're talking to you
back and forth and then,

2232
02:16:23,420 --> 02:16:27,250
and that's how you're beating off these
days. Hell yeah. Ben On these things. Oh,

2233
02:16:27,251 --> 02:16:29,820
it's the best for somebody that likes,
it's,

2234
02:16:29,821 --> 02:16:34,150
it's completely like heaven because you
fall in love with the girls and asking

2235
02:16:34,151 --> 02:16:36,890
me where are, you know,
but it's, it's, it's,

2236
02:16:36,891 --> 02:16:40,630
it's way better for anyone that
masturbates in porn wise now.

2237
02:16:40,631 --> 02:16:42,610
Cause now you get to
actually talk to the people.

2238
02:16:42,611 --> 02:16:47,320
It's like being at a strip club with
it, you know, you're, you're typing.

2239
02:16:47,320 --> 02:16:50,770
But uh, on some of them you can,
you pay for like a private room,

2240
02:16:50,890 --> 02:16:52,450
but it's more like,
it's like a huge chat room.

2241
02:16:52,451 --> 02:16:55,120
It's like watching this like on Ustream
where you're just sitting there getting

2242
02:16:55,121 --> 02:16:55,631
to know that girl.

2243
02:16:55,631 --> 02:16:58,810
The girl's talking back and forth
and you tipper like 20 tokens,

2244
02:16:58,811 --> 02:17:02,020
which is like a dollar. And then
she's like, oh, thank you. Oh here,

2245
02:17:02,021 --> 02:17:05,270
here's my tits out. What do you want?
All you have to depose a dog dude,

2246
02:17:05,300 --> 02:17:09,580
kind of third world. They think
Webcams, they've changed that.

2247
02:17:09,600 --> 02:17:12,190
They've changed it to like
where it's like a token amount.

2248
02:17:12,191 --> 02:17:15,580
Say it's really confusing. So,
uh, like kind of like Xbox.

2249
02:17:15,581 --> 02:17:18,980
So you might be into it a lot
more than you think. Yeah.
Well No, I mean I'll, I'll,

2250
02:17:18,981 --> 02:17:23,320
I'll, I'll, I'll put $20 into my
account and it'll last me a month.

2251
02:17:23,350 --> 02:17:25,990
And it's just like fucking chicks,
like hot,

2252
02:17:26,110 --> 02:17:30,070
normal girls that are in a lot of these
girls get to block the state that they

2253
02:17:30,071 --> 02:17:33,820
live in so that no one, their coworkers
don't know about it and stuff like that.

2254
02:17:33,821 --> 02:17:37,330
So these girls are just fucking normal
girls that like I just got off olive

2255
02:17:37,360 --> 02:17:39,040
garden,
capture them in video.

2256
02:17:39,070 --> 02:17:41,440
They don't know that they like
all these websites are saying

2257
02:17:43,580 --> 02:17:48,400
these tags, all these, all
these girls are saying,

2258
02:17:48,570 --> 02:17:51,190
cause I've actually heard people talk
about this before. It's like, oh no,

2259
02:17:51,191 --> 02:17:54,220
they have this protective,
you know, technology. So that
can't happen. And I'm like,

2260
02:17:54,221 --> 02:17:56,040
whenever I do it all the Chin and happen.

2261
02:17:59,100 --> 02:18:00,730
So these girls are
throwing away their lives.

2262
02:18:00,731 --> 02:18:03,650
And how far down the rabbit
hole of you gone? I mean do you,

2263
02:18:03,680 --> 02:18:08,100
do you $40 I mean have you talked to him
outside of the center? No, no, no, no, no.

2264
02:18:08,110 --> 02:18:11,080
They like using toys and stuff.
Was that what they do?

2265
02:18:11,140 --> 02:18:15,610
They're using toys that this one girl
has a fuck machine that she built that

2266
02:18:15,611 --> 02:18:17,740
looks like an erector set.
I don't know.

2267
02:18:17,870 --> 02:18:21,520
But it's using like I think imagine
trying to make that girl come. Yeah,

2268
02:18:21,910 --> 02:18:25,220
but it's awesome. So sit there
and just like it's broken callus.

2269
02:18:25,221 --> 02:18:29,560
Vagina is overstimulated
from this fucking machine,

2270
02:18:31,720 --> 02:18:34,600
but it's great.
Like the more you tip,

2271
02:18:34,601 --> 02:18:38,020
the faster she takes it and does
it. They're selling, these are,

2272
02:18:38,021 --> 02:18:41,800
these are girls like fucking trying to
sell some a new thing so she'll have this

2273
02:18:41,801 --> 02:18:44,410
fuck machine fucking are really
slow. And she's like, ah.

2274
02:18:44,620 --> 02:18:46,180
And then the more she gets in tips,

2275
02:18:46,181 --> 02:18:49,570
the faster she goes and then it goes to
like where she's just getting fucking

2276
02:18:49,571 --> 02:18:53,350
nailed. But she also just
made $1,000, you know,

2277
02:18:53,380 --> 02:18:58,050
so and it's completely free.
Like all these like my free cams,

2278
02:18:58,060 --> 02:19:00,340
all of this when I was
a young man did you,

2279
02:19:04,060 --> 02:19:05,010
but you know,

2280
02:19:05,011 --> 02:19:10,011
that's the thing to get the machine that's
fucking a woman that will get fucked

2281
02:19:10,781 --> 02:19:14,950
harder. It sort of backs up. My point
is that things, things are different.

2282
02:19:15,040 --> 02:19:19,990
They are different pistol to the fucking
fuck.

2283
02:19:19,991 --> 02:19:24,790
Rome, Rome, Rome, nothing on
that. Where are we going? Crazy.

2284
02:19:24,950 --> 02:19:28,310
That's a good question to you
are going to be a two years.

2285
02:19:28,550 --> 02:19:31,390
Um,
the Mysterians man,

2286
02:19:31,391 --> 02:19:35,060
the Mayan calendar man.
Well,

2287
02:19:35,061 --> 02:19:37,550
whatever the mines didn't predict
whatever it took them down.

2288
02:19:37,551 --> 02:19:41,650
So you know how good we
missed out on their shit.

2289
02:19:41,690 --> 02:19:44,090
Maybe their counter was like 12.

2290
02:19:44,120 --> 02:19:46,940
They actually recently found a
new version of the Mayan calendar,

2291
02:19:47,690 --> 02:19:51,350
even older that has
everything past December 21st,

2292
02:19:51,350 --> 02:19:53,750
2012 it's like we just saw it.
I mean they would like,

2293
02:19:53,751 --> 02:19:57,230
why keep going though the fuck
they live thousands of years ago.

2294
02:19:57,770 --> 02:20:02,770
Was that not ambitious enough that they
made a calendar up to 2012 this was me

2295
02:20:03,991 --> 02:20:05,900
is the end of the world.
They stopped here.

2296
02:20:06,320 --> 02:20:09,980
I don't even put anything three
months ahead on my Google calendar,

2297
02:20:10,280 --> 02:20:14,300
so I'm expecting the minds
get the blackout 2000 years.

2298
02:20:14,790 --> 02:20:18,020
December 21st,

2299
02:20:18,020 --> 02:20:21,470
2012 I think it's going to be another y
two k sort of situation. Remember that?

2300
02:20:21,840 --> 02:20:25,640
Everybody's terrified.
I think.

2301
02:20:25,910 --> 02:20:30,830
I haven't even given it any thought
to mind at all at all. I know who are,

2302
02:20:30,831 --> 02:20:34,400
you are concerned that there
is a possibility that we
could fuck up the world.

2303
02:20:34,430 --> 02:20:39,050
Then the next few years I do
question constantly like, you know,

2304
02:20:39,170 --> 02:20:42,730
where are we going as people like,
you know,

2305
02:20:42,740 --> 02:20:46,370
where just where are we going?
I mean I think, you know,

2306
02:20:46,371 --> 02:20:48,050
I know you're a fan of the technology,

2307
02:20:48,051 --> 02:20:51,950
but a lot of the technology I think
does help us isolate. You know,

2308
02:20:51,951 --> 02:20:56,600
people don't communicate people comment
and blog instead of actually use the

2309
02:20:56,601 --> 02:20:59,570
protocol of conversations,
which is like, you know,

2310
02:20:59,900 --> 02:21:04,160
there's boundaries when you're standing
next to someone talking, you know, and so,

2311
02:21:04,230 --> 02:21:06,050
and yeah,

2312
02:21:06,051 --> 02:21:09,860
I do wonder where we're going as people
this over entitled sense of where

2313
02:21:09,890 --> 02:21:13,880
everywhere you go you should be connected
into the Internet and not, you know,

2314
02:21:13,881 --> 02:21:16,790
you don't have to acknowledge the people
that are four feet in front of you.

2315
02:21:16,880 --> 02:21:19,700
It's weird, man. Well, the idea is
that they're mutually exclusive.

2316
02:21:19,940 --> 02:21:24,940
The idea is that you can't have ethics
and morals and be friendly and nice and

2317
02:21:26,121 --> 02:21:27,860
be on the Internet.
I think that's kind of silly.

2318
02:21:27,861 --> 02:21:32,590
I think what it is is we removed social
cues. We remove the interaction of the,

2319
02:21:32,591 --> 02:21:34,760
the one human to another where there's,

2320
02:21:34,820 --> 02:21:38,750
you have a direct result of the things
you say. You say something negative,

2321
02:21:38,751 --> 02:21:40,520
you see the person's face,
you feel it.

2322
02:21:40,910 --> 02:21:44,630
You don't feel shit when you just
rag on people from your snarky blog.

2323
02:21:44,770 --> 02:21:48,650
Right now you just write some country
words down designed to get some sparks.

2324
02:21:49,250 --> 02:21:52,220
And I think we could both
as comics relate to that.

2325
02:21:52,221 --> 02:21:55,610
We've all said things that we probably
didn't really necessarily mean,

2326
02:21:55,611 --> 02:21:57,680
but we knew we'd get a good response.

2327
02:21:57,880 --> 02:22:01,660
Like the guy who just made the
Cotonou s mom's joke. But the,

2328
02:22:02,540 --> 02:22:05,170
but here's the thing, I have to
feel the repercussions from that.

2329
02:22:05,360 --> 02:22:06,500
If he comes after me,

2330
02:22:06,501 --> 02:22:10,550
I have to apologize because I did step
over the line honestly when I said that.

2331
02:22:10,570 --> 02:22:15,390
Right. So, but the anonymous nature
of it makes it okay. You know, and,

2332
02:22:15,391 --> 02:22:19,580
and that's, that's, that's just a
tiny part of it. I mean, really it is,

2333
02:22:19,581 --> 02:22:21,740
but I don't think it's necessary.
I think a,

2334
02:22:21,741 --> 02:22:24,350
I think you can surround
yourself with a group of people.

2335
02:22:24,351 --> 02:22:26,010
Even online if you construct your own,
like

2336
02:22:26,070 --> 02:22:30,510
I have a message board and I try the
hardest I can to cut all the cons out.

2337
02:22:30,720 --> 02:22:34,290
Well then whenever people just start
getting really insulting for no reason,

2338
02:22:34,291 --> 02:22:38,160
a shitty or does negative, I just,
I get rid of them, I cut them out,

2339
02:22:38,190 --> 02:22:41,160
I send them to a pink room,
I have a room where they,

2340
02:22:41,170 --> 02:22:44,700
their names are all pink and this is
now they can only post in this new place

2341
02:22:44,701 --> 02:22:49,590
called the cont farm. And then, you
know, it tries as hard as, I mean,

2342
02:22:49,591 --> 02:22:53,270
it's not completely,
it's not flawless. The,

2343
02:22:53,560 --> 02:22:55,740
it's still a lot of assholes
slipped through the cracks.

2344
02:22:56,100 --> 02:23:00,940
But I have a friend who's on social media
and she's in show Biz, I'd say. And uh,

2345
02:23:01,320 --> 02:23:06,320
people will post or tweet something about
her and she'll respond and then they

2346
02:23:07,411 --> 02:23:09,990
always back down and
they go, oh, well I, oh,

2347
02:23:09,991 --> 02:23:13,410
I didn't know you were trying to get a
rise out of, but it just seems so crazy.

2348
02:23:13,410 --> 02:23:17,340
And then it gives people feel inadequate
and they feel like someone is doing

2349
02:23:17,341 --> 02:23:21,300
something that they can't do or on a
television show, and they can find,

2350
02:23:21,570 --> 02:23:25,290
they're not in the same situation as
that person, but they find a flaw,

2351
02:23:25,291 --> 02:23:27,990
they find a weakness, they find
something and they just lash out.

2352
02:23:28,230 --> 02:23:30,350
And what they're really lashing
out. It's not that, you know,

2353
02:23:30,420 --> 02:23:31,770
her acting is so atrocious.

2354
02:23:31,771 --> 02:23:35,220
It really drives him nuts to the point
where he's going to lash out and attacker,

2355
02:23:35,370 --> 02:23:39,690
no, it's just he's, he's a, he hates
his own life. He hates his own life. So

2356
02:23:40,960 --> 02:23:44,620
everybody's saying I exist and
stuff and, and a lot of, yeah,

2357
02:23:44,621 --> 02:23:47,240
I understand all that. But I
don't even think that's the, the,

2358
02:23:47,900 --> 02:23:52,480
the fact that we really are, I don't
know where we're going. I mean, really,

2359
02:23:52,481 --> 02:23:56,350
you know, and you ask yourself in
my part of the problem, or am I,

2360
02:23:56,351 --> 02:23:58,030
and where am I contributing to it?
I mean,

2361
02:23:58,031 --> 02:24:01,450
I'm not on social media and I don't
think of that as you were for a while.

2362
02:24:01,451 --> 02:24:05,830
We are on Twitter for a while. No, those
are fake. There's been fake mes, you know,

2363
02:24:06,340 --> 02:24:10,270
which kicking off the fake me,
it was pretty funny because it was so,

2364
02:24:10,420 --> 02:24:13,600
it was such a huge hassle where
I had to send in my passport,

2365
02:24:13,601 --> 02:24:17,560
sang that I'm me giving out my passport
information, you know what I mean?

2366
02:24:17,561 --> 02:24:21,490
That's kind of weird.
Twitter to Twitter to prove that I'm me,

2367
02:24:22,210 --> 02:24:25,990
you know? So yeah. And, and
I, you know, I have said like,

2368
02:24:25,991 --> 02:24:27,970
why would you say you're me in cyberspace?

2369
02:24:27,971 --> 02:24:31,810
Cause my daughter wants came in backward
and you know, my space, she's like, Dad,

2370
02:24:31,811 --> 02:24:36,560
there's some guy trying to get pussy
saint. He's on my space. I was like,

2371
02:24:36,880 --> 02:24:41,590
oh well we got to stop him. No,
but it really wasn't me. But,

2372
02:24:41,920 --> 02:24:45,190
but yeah, just recently I kicked the guy
off Twitter, a couple Twitter things,

2373
02:24:45,191 --> 02:24:48,250
you know, how come you have no desire? Um,

2374
02:24:48,730 --> 02:24:53,620
because I really don't give a shit what
po or you're 69 thanks in me. And uh,

2375
02:24:53,650 --> 02:24:57,700
the other part of it is,
is I already know that it's a warm hole.

2376
02:24:57,701 --> 02:25:00,400
I would go down and not come back out.
You know,

2377
02:25:00,430 --> 02:25:05,080
like I would rather spend my time
being creative now as a comedian.

2378
02:25:05,081 --> 02:25:08,470
I really should be out there so I could
plug my dates and all that stuff. But,

2379
02:25:08,920 --> 02:25:13,470
but I think it's the exposure to be
that exposed to people, uh, that,

2380
02:25:13,480 --> 02:25:17,600
that I don't like the idea of
that. And then also, um, it,

2381
02:25:17,670 --> 02:25:19,510
it feels like another job,
you know,

2382
02:25:19,511 --> 02:25:23,020
the constantly writing material
and posting it and stuff, you know,

2383
02:25:23,110 --> 02:25:24,130
don't have to constantly,
one

2384
02:25:24,130 --> 02:25:27,280
of the things that happens is developed
like a little community and they send

2385
02:25:27,281 --> 02:25:29,320
you cool shit and you can
just retweet them. You know,

2386
02:25:29,321 --> 02:25:32,110
sometimes when I'm running around in
the day and I don't have time to write

2387
02:25:32,111 --> 02:25:33,280
anything and put it on Twitter,

2388
02:25:33,281 --> 02:25:37,270
but I'll occasionally check in
and I get these really weird,

2389
02:25:37,271 --> 02:25:40,360
crazy tweets where people send
me some, you know, naughty,

2390
02:25:40,361 --> 02:25:43,600
fascinating thing and I'll retweet
it. And then, you know, they'll,

2391
02:25:43,630 --> 02:25:48,040
it develops like a whole community of
people like looking out for that stuff and

2392
02:25:48,041 --> 02:25:51,460
people that, like that stuff. And
every, you know, and I think it,

2393
02:25:51,500 --> 02:25:55,420
it provides a service to,
it provides a connection.

2394
02:25:55,660 --> 02:25:59,500
You know you're the catalyst and you
connect all these hundreds of thousands of

2395
02:25:59,501 --> 02:26:03,580
people together and the exchange ideas.
I think that's nothing but good.

2396
02:26:03,880 --> 02:26:04,630
You know the,
the,

2397
02:26:04,630 --> 02:26:09,630
the thing about it is trying to
make sure that you don't overuse it.

2398
02:26:09,970 --> 02:26:10,803
You know,
you don't,

2399
02:26:10,870 --> 02:26:15,100
you could get stuck on Twitter all day
just responding to people and never and

2400
02:26:15,130 --> 02:26:17,950
never leave your office and never,
never leave in front of the computer.

2401
02:26:17,951 --> 02:26:18,940
You really could share.

2402
02:26:18,941 --> 02:26:22,660
Of course you got to learn how to walk
away at a certain point in time for sure.

2403
02:26:22,690 --> 02:26:26,920
And you know, got to learn how to not not
let it be obsessive, but as a comedian,

2404
02:26:26,921 --> 02:26:30,620
it's an amazing tool. You still do morning
radio and all that kind of stuff. Yeah.

2405
02:26:30,660 --> 02:26:32,140
Yeah. You don't have to
do that if you ever, ever,

2406
02:26:32,160 --> 02:26:34,160
and I have to do it anywhere it's
going to play out is really good.

2407
02:26:34,270 --> 02:26:36,910
Twitter and podcasts to dragged
that. Yeah. We don't have,

2408
02:26:36,940 --> 02:26:41,050
we don't do that anymore. Like we
have a show tonight that Joe put up,

2409
02:26:41,390 --> 02:26:43,810
start talking about yesterday
and it's almost sold out. Yeah.

2410
02:26:43,811 --> 02:26:46,840
We just decided to do a show. We said,
oh, we're going to do it. By the way,

2411
02:26:46,841 --> 02:26:51,160
if you want to get it, get tickets now.
It's already should fear Joey Diaz, me,

2412
02:26:51,250 --> 02:26:53,680
Christina [inaudible] is John [inaudible].
John Heffrons,

2413
02:26:53,681 --> 02:26:56,560
not by Randy licky from
bones on us. Powerful. It's,

2414
02:26:56,561 --> 02:27:00,160
it's a serious show and it's only 15 bucks
and it's at the Ice House comedy club,

2415
02:27:00,161 --> 02:27:03,580
which is one of the oldest clubs,
if not the oldest in the country.

2416
02:27:03,581 --> 02:27:06,430
This place started in 1950 and uh,

2417
02:27:06,460 --> 02:27:08,960
it's just a super cool
club filled with the,

2418
02:27:09,000 --> 02:27:13,090
everyone that works here is like really
nice. It's like a good vibe place, right?

2419
02:27:13,410 --> 02:27:16,900
Who says we love doing the
podcast here? Yeah. It's like,

2420
02:27:16,901 --> 02:27:20,410
it's such a warm environment. It's
like they're cool people. So you'll,

2421
02:27:20,411 --> 02:27:23,590
you'll like coming here and so it's
a big show tonight at 10 o'clock.

2422
02:27:23,860 --> 02:27:25,630
Anything else ma'am? No, that's it.

2423
02:27:25,800 --> 02:27:28,510
That you can get my new movie.
Uh,

2424
02:27:28,530 --> 02:27:32,760
God bless America and Vod and, uh,
all the other movies are on Netflix.

2425
02:27:32,761 --> 02:27:36,930
Sleeping dogs lie. World's greatest
dad. All my movies have last.

2426
02:27:37,070 --> 02:27:40,230
The world's greatest dad.
Uh, God bless America.

2427
02:27:40,500 --> 02:27:42,840
My buddy of mine a build a labs like a,

2428
02:27:42,841 --> 02:27:44,700
as soon as the next one it
would be I'm with stupid

2429
02:27:46,510 --> 02:27:50,260
tee shirt or a coffee mug series.
Is that what you doing when you're doing?

2430
02:27:51,740 --> 02:27:53,880
No, I don't know why. I mean I,

2431
02:27:53,890 --> 02:27:58,270
I'm going to probably break it soon and
make a movie without a three name title.

2432
02:27:58,660 --> 02:28:00,430
Could fit on a t shirt.
Yeah. If you come back again,

2433
02:28:00,431 --> 02:28:04,810
I promise you I will see world's greatest
dad and I will see God bless America.

2434
02:28:04,860 --> 02:28:07,360
We will discuss both of them
next time we come back. Cool man.

2435
02:28:07,361 --> 02:28:09,760
Thanks for having me. Yeah. Oh, it was
a lot of fun, man. I really enjoyed it.

much. Thank you. Bobcat.
