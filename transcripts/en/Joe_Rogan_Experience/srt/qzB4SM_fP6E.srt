00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:02,880
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:03,720
What did you,

3
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:06,300
what is the big thing that you
got out of this personally?

4
00:00:06,301 --> 00:00:07,950
Or sort of intellectual above?

5
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:08,910
I mean,

6
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:09,960
intellectually as personally,

7
00:00:09,961 --> 00:00:10,590
right?

8
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:11,423
Personally,

9
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:12,150
you know,

10
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:12,840
there was,

11
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,720
I'd been through sort of lifetime of,

12
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:17,010
I dunno,

13
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:19,560
like I was a late bloomer as a kid.

14
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:21,360
I'm real small,

15
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:25,410
always sort of the front
of my school came into my,

16
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:25,990
my throat,

17
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:27,150
an average sized guy now,

18
00:00:27,151 --> 00:00:30,630
but I came to my growth really
late and so I sort of have a basic,

19
00:00:30,631 --> 00:00:31,230
you know,

20
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:34,160
schoolboy story about getting
pushed around and bullied and,

21
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:35,363
and it's,

22
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:38,640
there's no heroism in that
story that always backed down.

23
00:00:38,641 --> 00:00:39,620
I always ran for it.

24
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,170
I always found some way out of it.

25
00:00:41,171 --> 00:00:43,680
And it wasn't because I was a pacifist.

26
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:47,370
It wasn't like had some noble high
minded reasons for avoiding the violence.

27
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,920
It was that I was scared and I
knew I was gonna get my ass kicked.

28
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:52,530
But I've always kind of felt like
that's no excuse for not for fighting,

29
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:53,790
you know,

30
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:54,830
that there's a huge,

31
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,310
you should stand up to the bully.

32
00:00:56,410 --> 00:00:56,700
Um,

33
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:58,620
I've always felt that way and
even though I never did it so,

34
00:00:59,280 --> 00:00:59,700
so,

35
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:03,270
so part of what I wanted to
do was I wanted to go into
that cage and I wanted to

36
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:07,800
sort of stand up to guys who were stronger
than me and more skilled than me and

37
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:10,980
sort of taken those beatings that I felt
like I should have taken 20 years ago.

38
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:11,843
You know what I mean?

39
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:12,390
Um,

40
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:13,500
and so as deep.

41
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:13,951
Well,

42
00:01:13,951 --> 00:01:14,360
yeah,

43
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,193
you know,

44
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:17,910
I don't know if you've ever had
experience like that as a boy.

45
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:19,180
Um,

46
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:20,013
where were you?

47
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:23,460
Were you behaved in a fashion
that you define as cowardly?

48
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:23,791
Yes,

49
00:01:23,791 --> 00:01:24,420
definitely.

50
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:25,890
And it's amazing to me.

51
00:01:25,891 --> 00:01:27,210
I'm 42 years old now.

52
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:29,750
I've had a lot of
accomplishments in my life,

53
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,750
have a beautiful wife,

54
00:01:30,751 --> 00:01:32,730
I have little children who are wonderful.

55
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:38,420
It's amazing to me how much psychological
weight that still carries from me that

56
00:01:38,461 --> 00:01:39,390
I could still meet myself,

57
00:01:39,391 --> 00:01:40,224
blush,

58
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:40,650
uh,

59
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:41,850
thinking back to those moments.

60
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:44,160
And so part of it was a redemption
story for me about whether I could,

61
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:47,790
whether I could do
something to redeem myself,

62
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:52,140
at least in my own eyes for those
times when I'd flinched a as a kid.

63
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:52,861
That's awesome.

64
00:01:52,861 --> 00:01:53,551
I love that.

65
00:01:53,551 --> 00:01:54,570
I love that you did that.

66
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:55,411
I don't love that.

67
00:01:55,411 --> 00:01:56,430
You're still blushing over it.

68
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,360
Silly social a little bit.

69
00:01:58,380 --> 00:01:59,131
It's so crazy.

70
00:01:59,131 --> 00:02:00,660
But it just means you've got work to do.

71
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,541
That's all it is.

72
00:02:01,541 --> 00:02:01,800
You know,

73
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,200
just kind of worked before you
realize you're not that guy anymore.

74
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:04,861
Right.

75
00:02:04,861 --> 00:02:05,694
You know.

76
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,800
So when you're doing these heavy,

77
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:08,920
heavy lifting,

78
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,230
it dead ends,

79
00:02:10,231 --> 00:02:11,130
that impulse,

80
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,020
it slows it down.

81
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,320
And uh,

82
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:14,640
not,

83
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,650
not to mention you're
neglecting the forefoot.

84
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:19,340
All these exercises are pretty
much done on the ball on the hill.

85
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,791
I was squatting.

86
00:02:20,791 --> 00:02:22,120
I remember as you're,

87
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:25,560
you're taught to press through that
heel deadlifting the same thing.

88
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:26,041
So your,

89
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:26,371
your,

90
00:02:26,371 --> 00:02:30,540
your training over and over
these movements that are
not practical for a sports

91
00:02:30,541 --> 00:02:31,020
movement,

92
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:33,900
which pretty much every sport
is played on the forefoot.

93
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:34,351
Yeah,

94
00:02:34,351 --> 00:02:34,801
that's true.

95
00:02:34,801 --> 00:02:36,150
Like he never really in a sport.

96
00:02:36,151 --> 00:02:38,790
You very rarely push off
the back of the foot,

97
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:42,570
so kind of moving forward when you're
punching the back heels off the ground.

98
00:02:42,571 --> 00:02:43,404
Absolutely.

99
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,710
And so knowing that it's kind of like,

100
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:49,190
why are we doing this?

101
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:49,550
You know,

102
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:50,030
like w,

103
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:50,250
W,

104
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:50,470
W,

105
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:51,303
W,

106
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,830
it's improper training.

107
00:02:52,831 --> 00:02:54,140
I mean it really makes sense.

108
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:57,180
Mark has been preaching
this for years and you know,

109
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:02,050
and people of Scoff at it and you see
now I got to get my heavy back squat and

110
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:03,101
that's fine,

111
00:03:03,101 --> 00:03:04,960
but maybe this can help you with it.

112
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,320
You know,

113
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,270
start training the feet,

114
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:10,120
looking at looking at what we're talking
about here and the sequence of muscles

115
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:13,180
that you're going to start firing
when you do start training the feed,

116
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:18,450
like how is this a better option for
squatting would be a front squat.

117
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:23,440
And now let's say you take a couple of
45 pound plates and you put them under

118
00:03:23,441 --> 00:03:24,310
the balls of your feet.

119
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:27,550
So now you're engaging more of a sports
movie and you're on the balls of your

120
00:03:27,551 --> 00:03:29,950
feet and you're loading up
the front instead of the back,

121
00:03:29,951 --> 00:03:33,190
which is the back squat is
technically a lower back exercise.

122
00:03:33,191 --> 00:03:35,740
It really hits the lumbar
and his lower back a lot.

123
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:36,610
Uh,

124
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:40,540
the front squat is going to hit more
quadricep muscles required for jumping,

125
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,553
you know what I mean,

126
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:45,190
as well as the core and stabilizing
the spine with the abdominals and

127
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:46,360
everything.

128
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:49,570
So that's just a thought
like maybe you can do that.

129
00:03:49,571 --> 00:03:50,140
You think,

130
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:54,250
start thinking in that process where
you're training from the feet up the

131
00:03:54,251 --> 00:03:55,001
forefoot up,

132
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:58,630
not just the heels of the forefoot up
and you'll start connecting different

133
00:03:58,631 --> 00:04:00,520
muscles require for sports movements.

134
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:01,541
Okay.

135
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:01,960
Let's see.

136
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:04,510
Not a hero and other stuff with Alex.

137
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:06,293
this is Kevin.

138
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:08,940
Kevin Right now can crank up the volume,

139
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:09,750

I don't know.

143
00:04:12,571 --> 00:04:12,990
This.

144
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:17,990
Kevin Pereira was the host of attack of
the show for network and the objective

145
00:04:18,931 --> 00:04:19,740
is asking.

146

00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:28,180
Boom.

150

00:04:30,121 --> 00:04:31,260
Did they dispatch a shot?

153
00:04:31,261 --> 00:04:32,340
That dude in the face so much.

154
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:35,043
He's got a partner.

155
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:35,331
Oh,

156

157
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:37,990
Headshot blogs.

158
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:40,010

What a weird world we live in
respect to the CS go communities.

168
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:12,550
So is that Kevin's studio that
we're looking at in the corner?

169
00:05:13,871 --> 00:05:14,070
Yeah,

170
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:14,903
this is man cave.

171
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:17,090
This is one part of his studio.

172
00:05:17,091 --> 00:05:20,660
This is where he does all his twitch
gaming and stuff in his podcast.

173
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,040
The first thing you think
of in all these rooms,

174
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:25,420
it's like where did they rub one out?

175
00:05:25,421 --> 00:05:26,254
Like what part of

176
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:31,270
the script on you?

177
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,353
Motherfucker.

178
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:34,683
Rogan.

179
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:35,500
Alright,

180
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,161
how can we do this?

181
00:05:36,161 --> 00:05:37,270
Let's enter the Matrix.

182
00:05:37,271 --> 00:05:38,104
We can somehow.

183
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:39,940
There's a lag though.

184
00:05:39,941 --> 00:05:40,960
Unfortunately.

185
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:42,430
It's probably like seven to 10 seconds.

186
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,120
Look at that.

187
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,180
You just opened the floodgate of racist.

188
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,053
Yeah.

189
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:49,953
No,

190
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,900
it's always racist stuff for some reason.

191
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:59,080
That's I subscribers Kevin.

192
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:00,760
There we go.

193
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,050
Oh,

194
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:01,883
not logged in.

195
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:03,530
Then Joe Rogan wants to the studio.

196
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:05,510
Are you logged in to see your studio?

197
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:06,270
The studio.

198
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:06,511
Oh,

199
00:06:06,511 --> 00:06:07,011
how cool.

200
00:06:07,011 --> 00:06:08,220
This is getting way confusing.

201
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:09,180
This is so bizarre.

202
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,010
It's like two mirrors facing each other.

203
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:11,510
Who?

204
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:12,630
Nice Sriracha shirt.

205
00:06:12,631 --> 00:06:13,464
Yes sir.

206
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:15,690
Get that attorney Kevin Pereira.

207
00:06:15,691 --> 00:06:17,340
Would that get dope studio?

208
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:20,050
Can we go full screen?

209
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:20,831
Full screen on the Cam.

210
00:06:20,831 --> 00:06:21,131
Look at that.

211
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:21,731
Hey Kevin,

212
00:06:21,731 --> 00:06:23,590
we're finally getting to hear you.

213
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:24,130
Now.

214
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:24,963
Here's this.

215
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:26,480
Want that jail.

216
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:27,350
This is doe.

217
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:32,350
That experience podcast table Alex
and what we call the band room,

218
00:06:33,371 --> 00:06:34,960
but I don't even know how
we get up to the band room.

219
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:35,600
Alright.

220
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:35,890
Alright.

221
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:37,060
Can you sprint?

222
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:38,560
This is a place he's renting.

223
00:06:38,561 --> 00:06:40,270
They need like a USB extension cord.

224
00:06:40,271 --> 00:06:40,870
Walk me.

225
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:41,381
Look at this.

226
00:06:41,381 --> 00:06:42,490
This is hilarious.

227
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:43,001
Boy,

228
00:06:43,001 --> 00:06:44,800
this is so bizarre watching Kevin

229
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:47,703
get out of there.

230
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:55,000
So we're watching Kevin Pereira
and it's the attack on twitch.

231
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:56,480
It's getting way confused.

232
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,910
We'll get a gun AC.

233
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:59,990
You're hearing too far in los looks,

234
00:06:59,991 --> 00:07:00,271
Bro.

235
00:07:00,271 --> 00:07:02,590
Is fucked today backward.

236
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,780
That was brought out.

237
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:05,091
Wow.

238
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:06,740
This is very strange studio.

239
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,210
Oh Joe,

240
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:08,661
just wait.

241
00:07:08,661 --> 00:07:10,080
I'm going to give you the Kevin.

242
00:07:10,081 --> 00:07:11,960
We're finally getting to hear you.

243
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:12,501
Now.

244
00:07:12,501 --> 00:07:13,334
Here's a student.

245
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:14,480
This is interesting.

246
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:15,880
Oh,

247
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:18,680
so he's freaking me out.

248
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:19,743
Now we've got the

249
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,333
bar

250
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:24,321
watching us.

251
00:07:24,321 --> 00:07:25,190
Watching them.

252
00:07:25,191 --> 00:07:26,380
This is fucking.

253
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:29,660
I think we can time travel somehow.

254
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:30,783
We just did.

255
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,030
Look what we're doing here.

256
00:07:32,031 --> 00:07:34,410
We're showing his dick
again back to his tablet.

257
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:35,600
Chose.

258
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,470
Got a full head of hair.

259
00:07:36,471 --> 00:07:37,304
What's good?

260
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:39,200
This is all so bizarre.

261
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:39,621
Run.

262
00:07:39,621 --> 00:07:42,160
So this is where he plays pinball,

263
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:43,643
foods ball.

264
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:44,630
It's bunch of couches.

265
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:47,180
There's also has a humongous
green screen on the side.

266
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,620
Here's this kitchen area,

267
00:07:48,621 --> 00:07:49,700
which is like a bar in the middle.

268
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,230
Here's this bar here.

269
00:07:51,231 --> 00:07:52,050
You can just turn it up.

270
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:53,180
Oh yeah.

271
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:55,880
So this is joe is a pool table,

272
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:57,050
like a drink of whatever.

273
00:07:57,051 --> 00:07:57,884
Poison your mind.

274
00:07:58,810 --> 00:07:59,643
Wow.

275
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,340
This is the best room,

276
00:08:01,341 --> 00:08:02,174
right?

277
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:04,670
Okay.

278
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:06,170
This is really fascinating.

279
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,150
Oh Kevin,

280
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:10,190
that's a whole recording studio.

281
00:08:10,191 --> 00:08:11,024
Set up,

282
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,370
messing around already.

283
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:13,490
Sessions and whatnot.

284
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,061
Oh my God.

285
00:08:14,061 --> 00:08:15,380
This place must be huge.

286
00:08:15,381 --> 00:08:17,470
His keys and guitar.

287
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:22,480
Joe wrote it out because we have issues
and then so loungy sorta hang out area.

288
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:27,080
We can also unlatch the barn
doors here and push them out.

289
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:29,690
It's just push out and we
have room for like 150 people,

290
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,420
so he has shown he has live shows,

291
00:08:32,421 --> 00:08:37,130
concerts and stuff invites his
friends and fam dicks we can allow.

292
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:38,450
This is crazy.

293
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:40,910
Kevin Pereira is taken to the next level.
