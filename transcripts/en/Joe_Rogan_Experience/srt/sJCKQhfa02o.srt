ladies and gentlemen,

15
00:00:41,401 --> 00:00:45,100
we have returned back from the
depths from the silence of two weeks.

16
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:45,611
Two weeks,

17
00:00:45,611 --> 00:00:46,360
two plus weeks.

18
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:46,601
Yeah,

19
00:00:46,601 --> 00:00:47,790
it's been fucking long time.

20
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:48,850
Even I wasn't missing it.

21
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:49,720
It's been a long time.

22
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:50,650
I was miss doing it.

23
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:51,933
I was missing it.

24
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:52,630
And uh,

25
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:54,010
I appreciate all the
emails and everything.

26
00:00:54,011 --> 00:00:56,830
I had to do a movie and
it took off all my time.

27
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:57,330
There was no,

28
00:00:57,330 --> 00:01:01,360
there was no time to do it and I was
going to half ass a podcast on the set,

29
00:01:01,361 --> 00:01:02,194
but some people,

30
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:03,220
but I got sick.

31
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:05,710
Tommy Segora fucked me up,

32
00:01:05,711 --> 00:01:06,070
man.

33
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:07,580
Fuck me up to Thompson.

34
00:01:07,581 --> 00:01:09,940
Gora is one of those
dudes that's always sick.

35
00:01:09,941 --> 00:01:10,570
He gets sick,

36
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:11,770
sick like four times a year.

37
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:12,160
Like,

38
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:12,670
you know,

39
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:12,910
that's,

40
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:13,480
that's a lot,

41
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:13,780
you know,

42
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:14,760
three or four times a year or so.

43
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:15,670
And uh,

44
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:19,720
we did cobs and he showed up first
day sick as shit and I'm like,

45
00:01:19,721 --> 00:01:20,380
you okay?

46
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:20,921
Like you okay?

47
00:01:20,921 --> 00:01:21,131
He's like,

48
00:01:21,131 --> 00:01:21,251
yeah,

49
00:01:21,251 --> 00:01:21,461
yeah,

50
00:01:21,461 --> 00:01:22,151
I think I'm going to be okay.

51
00:01:22,151 --> 00:01:22,361
I just,

52
00:01:22,361 --> 00:01:22,700
you know,

53
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:23,770
just get some rest tonight.

54
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:25,240
And meanwhile he had the flu.

55
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:25,990
All right.

56
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:27,790
He had the flu and he
gave it to all of us.

57
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:28,271
He just,

58
00:01:28,271 --> 00:01:28,571
you know,

59
00:01:28,571 --> 00:01:29,550
didn't know he had the float.

60
00:01:29,551 --> 00:01:30,790
He just thought he was
going to gut it out.

61
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:32,200
And I was okay on Thursday,

62
00:01:32,201 --> 00:01:34,450
but then Friday night I
started feeling like shit.

63
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:36,070
And then Saturday I took,

64
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:36,240
uh,

65
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,073
you know,

66
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:38,200
as see me phentermine,

67
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:39,160
what it was that stuff.

68
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:39,561
Yes.

69
00:01:39,561 --> 00:01:42,390
Some Meta phenom in and then really long
name that's from a different country.

70
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,180
I took that shit and you know,

71
00:01:44,181 --> 00:01:46,210
a dried out my nose up
enough so I could perform,

72
00:01:46,211 --> 00:01:48,010
but I was clearly like a little cloudy,

73
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:48,491
you know,

74
00:01:48,491 --> 00:01:48,790
I was like,

75
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:49,361
I was feeling it.

76
00:01:49,361 --> 00:01:49,811
Come on.

77
00:01:49,811 --> 00:01:52,840
And then I had to fly all the way to
fucking Boston and it's just something

78
00:01:52,841 --> 00:01:57,730
about those tubes filled with other
people's air that is like the worst thing

79
00:01:57,731 --> 00:01:58,780
for your immune system.

80
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:02,620
If you've got like a kink in your immune
system and then you get on a plane.

81
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:03,431
Whoa.

82
00:02:03,431 --> 00:02:04,450
Do you get jacked?

83
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:05,523
I landed in,

84
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:06,341
in Boston.

85
00:02:06,341 --> 00:02:07,900
I had the shakes.

86
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:11,110
I was like sweating in bed
and then I wake up freezing.

87
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:12,970
Like all of it just swamped.

88
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:13,870
What are you telling me now?

89
00:02:13,871 --> 00:02:14,531
I'm going to be sick.

90
00:02:14,531 --> 00:02:16,510
The don't make out with Tom Segura.

91
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:18,160
I've been healthy for like a whole week.

92
00:02:18,161 --> 00:02:18,251
Yeah,

93
00:02:18,251 --> 00:02:19,210
but you still let the bugging.

94
00:02:19,211 --> 00:02:21,370
What the fuck dog that
I got shit to do this.

95
00:02:21,371 --> 00:02:21,610
Well,

96
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:23,770
as long as we're not making
out or sharing a microphone,

97
00:02:23,771 --> 00:02:25,060
but he gonna fuck a swap spit here,

98
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:25,721
but it's in the air.

99
00:02:25,721 --> 00:02:26,001
You don't what?

100
00:02:26,001 --> 00:02:26,770
These microbes,

101
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:27,760
we just shared a joint.

102
00:02:27,761 --> 00:02:29,360
What do you guys tie going fucking son.

103
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:32,380
I've got to go home and fucking
open up on the old vitamin C pacs,

104
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:34,820
I think like eight of
tonight and I got a flat,

105
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:35,320
I think.

106
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,310
I don't think I'm contagious.

107
00:02:36,311 --> 00:02:37,960
The doctor told me I'm not contagious.

108
00:02:37,961 --> 00:02:38,441
Once your,

109
00:02:38,441 --> 00:02:39,410
once your fever breaks,

110
00:02:39,411 --> 00:02:40,280
she says you're not contained.

111
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:42,160
My girlfriend got fucked
and I felt right though.

112
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:44,500
I got a little bit of it
but my girlfriend is dead.

113
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:45,071
Yeah,

114
00:02:45,071 --> 00:02:45,904
it skipped over me.

115
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:49,750
You gotta be careful if you this when
you pull all nighters and do stupid shit.

116
00:02:49,751 --> 00:02:50,770
And this is when you realize it.

117
00:02:50,771 --> 00:02:51,790
Like when I got it,

118
00:02:51,791 --> 00:02:55,330
I was playing pool in San
Francisco Cause Thursday night,

119
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:55,601
uh,

120
00:02:55,601 --> 00:02:59,290
we did a show and then I went out and
played pool late late til like six,

121
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:03,010
six 30 in the morning and then drove it
and I was exhausted and I just jacked my

122
00:03:03,011 --> 00:03:03,800
immune system.

123
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,360
Yeah.

124
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:07,690
And then the next day I had it plus the
night before plus your ci was down from

125
00:03:07,691 --> 00:03:08,800
the flag flying.

126
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:09,970
The CI is down.

127
00:03:09,971 --> 00:03:12,760
That's when the fucking flu
goes right to the news and boom,

128
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:13,621
once it grabs you,

129
00:03:13,621 --> 00:03:14,321
you would look at,

130
00:03:14,321 --> 00:03:15,041
grab your bro.

131
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:16,120
That's a strong flu.

132
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:18,610
Well you're telling me is by
the time you got on the plane,

133
00:03:18,611 --> 00:03:19,301
you are really getting,

134
00:03:19,301 --> 00:03:20,600
the children should had just strong.

135
00:03:20,601 --> 00:03:21,460
That's fucking flu.

136
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:22,990
What is it going on in the plane?

137
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,470
Is it just the recycled air
is just terrible for you?

138
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,610
It's the APP altitude.

139
00:03:27,611 --> 00:03:28,850
Is that terrible for you too?

140
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:30,510
And my attitude,

141
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:31,760
I heard CCI,

142
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:32,391
we've talked about that.

143
00:03:32,391 --> 00:03:33,021
I think there's probably a bit,

144
00:03:33,021 --> 00:03:36,460
I heard that the recycled air and the
plane and it's actually really good like

145
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:36,860
that.

146
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:39,380
There's a really good air since
you moved that for my Ann Coulter.

147
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:39,610
No,

148
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:39,890
no,

149
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:42,770
they did like a dateline thing about it
and I think they actually talked to the

150
00:03:42,771 --> 00:03:45,740
people that design the air systems
and planes and they said that no,

151
00:03:45,741 --> 00:03:46,580
they're really good.

152
00:03:46,581 --> 00:03:47,780
They're filtered really well.

153
00:03:47,781 --> 00:03:48,710
So what's the problem?

154
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:50,830
I think it has to be an altitude.

155
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,370
Just just the flu marinated in you,

156
00:03:52,371 --> 00:03:52,611
Bro.

157
00:03:52,611 --> 00:03:52,950
This,

158
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:53,783
but the fluid,

159
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:54,441
the flu,

160
00:03:54,441 --> 00:03:55,540
Marin Ellison,

161
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:56,131
you know,

162
00:03:56,131 --> 00:03:57,610
we've been getting fluids once a year,

163
00:03:57,611 --> 00:03:58,444
especially the case.

164
00:03:58,620 --> 00:03:59,610
We're over 40 years.

165
00:03:59,611 --> 00:04:01,290
I haven't gotten one in a couple of years.

166
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:04,980
I've been real good about blue gets
stronger these days is a strange,

167
00:04:04,981 --> 00:04:05,814
isn't that what they call it?

168
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:06,481
A flu.

169
00:04:06,481 --> 00:04:07,610
A fucking getting stronger.

170
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,930
Know that are they all
come from farm animals?

171
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:11,753
Yes.

172
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:14,550
Almost all of them come
from domesticated animals.

173
00:04:14,551 --> 00:04:17,290
They come from pigs and
chickens and birds and you know,

174
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,170
that's why when they said this
is the bird flu and it was like,

175
00:04:19,171 --> 00:04:19,651
Holy Shit,

176
00:04:19,651 --> 00:04:20,370
the bird flu.

177
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:23,460
Well they're kind of all bird
flus or pig flu is a swine flu.

178
00:04:23,461 --> 00:04:23,841
They're there,

179
00:04:23,841 --> 00:04:25,290
they're fucking livestock diseases.

180
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:26,124
A lot of times,

181
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:26,701
you know,

182
00:04:26,701 --> 00:04:26,881
we,

183
00:04:26,881 --> 00:04:30,060
we're probably making these fucking things
by forcing all these animals to live

184
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:30,710
in shit.

185
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:30,930
Right.

186
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:31,111
You know,

187
00:04:31,111 --> 00:04:32,220
and be on top of each other.

188
00:04:32,221 --> 00:04:33,810
That's probably where
these things come from.

189
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:34,081
I mean,

190
00:04:34,081 --> 00:04:34,914
I don't know.

191
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:38,190
But when you start telling me that a lot
of fluids or livestock diseases and you

192
00:04:38,191 --> 00:04:38,431
know,

193
00:04:38,431 --> 00:04:40,080
what the fuck we do to livestock,

194
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:42,270
there's gotta be some
sort of a connection.

195
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,410
Absolutely.

196
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:43,830
You know,

197
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:46,380
the livestock industry should be
responsible for all those deaths,

198
00:04:46,381 --> 00:04:47,340
if that can be proven.

199
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:50,370
But if it's possible to prove that
they're the reason why the flu exists,

200
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:52,680
but then again you need pork chops.

201
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:53,723
So what the fuck

202
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:57,590
did you see that the pyramid shit
where they took a robot through that?

203
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,470
That did,

204
00:04:58,470 --> 00:04:58,770
yeah.

205
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:03,770
They saw some writing that had been
unseen for at least 4,000 years I think.

206
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:04,101
Yeah.

207
00:05:04,101 --> 00:05:04,551
What is it?

208
00:05:04,551 --> 00:05:07,010
It was like red and we're
going to figure it out.

209
00:05:07,011 --> 00:05:08,970
I can even see by this pictures I was

210
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:11,940
in Boston and while I was there
when I started feeling better,

211
00:05:11,941 --> 00:05:15,960
which the museum and went to the Museum
of fine arts and they had all these

212
00:05:15,961 --> 00:05:20,961
Egyptian art and it was all like
ancient ancient shit like 2000 BC,

213
00:05:21,181 --> 00:05:23,090
you know all the way up
to like Cleopatra's era,

214
00:05:23,091 --> 00:05:24,210
which is like the later errors.

215
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:26,820
It's fucking fascinating stuff man.

216
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:28,470
You know when you really get into Egypt,

217
00:05:28,471 --> 00:05:30,690
how weird they are in comparison to us.

218
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:33,030
Like when you just look
at like what they did,

219
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:37,470
they had is like super advanced culture
that was completely different than ours.

220
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:41,520
Like so completely different that
their writings was all image based.

221
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:43,020
Instead of like having letters,

222
00:05:43,021 --> 00:05:48,021
they had like images that represents
symbols and so all the writing is their

223
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:49,320
conceptual.

224
00:05:49,321 --> 00:05:53,580
Like the way they looked at the world
was completely different than the way we

225
00:05:53,581 --> 00:05:54,270
look at it.

226
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:57,060
The way we look at things with
our writing and our language,

227
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:58,340
our our western

228
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:01,760
interpretation of morals and
values and what's important,

229
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:02,594
what's not important.

230
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,140
This is just something we sort of settled
on and what you see with the ancient

231
00:06:06,141 --> 00:06:10,760
Egyptians as well here was this really
advanced culture that was incapable of

232
00:06:10,761 --> 00:06:15,761
these incredible architectural
masterpieces that we're puzzled by today.

233
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,480
Like they'll tell you that.

234
00:06:17,481 --> 00:06:19,580
They know how they built the
pyramids all we figured it out.

235
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:24,940
It is a such a staggering
accomplishment that these people,

236
00:06:25,131 --> 00:06:30,131
2,500 BC built these immense
perfect stone structures.

237
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:33,500
I mean they're fucking big.

238
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,461
2 million,

239
00:06:34,461 --> 00:06:39,461
300,000 stones the way between two and
80 tons and some of them were cut from a

240
00:06:39,531 --> 00:06:42,590
quarry that was 500 fucking miles away.

241
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:44,750
I mean these people were bad,

242
00:06:44,751 --> 00:06:46,040
bad mother fuckers.

243
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:48,990
They were doing some shit that none of
us in this room could ever fucking figure

244
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:49,410
it out.

245
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:54,410
It was complex mathematics to cause you
had to have every stone cut perfectly by

246
00:06:54,681 --> 00:06:57,800
the time you got to the top
because any little room for error,

247
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:59,240
you're shit would be cockeyed.

248
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:00,590
You're 2 million,

249
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:03,230
300,000 stones in the Great Pyramid.

250
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:07,940
Think about how perfect you have to be
the entire way and adjust all the way.

251
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:11,480
And now it's not like those stones are
like this smaller one side and huge on

252
00:07:11,481 --> 00:07:12,470
the other and it's all,

253
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:14,060
they tried to balance it out the end.

254
00:07:14,061 --> 00:07:14,210
No,

255
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:14,390
no,

256
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:14,421
no,

257
00:07:14,421 --> 00:07:14,481
no,

258
00:07:14,481 --> 00:07:14,840
no.

259
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,980
The shit is perfect.

260
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:18,950
And 2,500,000 years ago,

261
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:19,641
and it used to be,

262
00:07:19,641 --> 00:07:20,474
we look at it now,

263
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:21,440
it's all fucked up.

264
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:22,720
And crumply that's cause they,

265
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,720
they rated it,

266
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,270
it was covered in smooth limestone.

267
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:28,550
They must have been so fucking beautiful.

268
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:30,200
But when they built Cairo,

269
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:33,020
they stole all the
limestone from the pyramids.

270
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:36,800
Those little eight monkey people just
chipped away at what their great,

271
00:07:36,801 --> 00:07:38,420
great ancestors had created.

272
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:41,660
You know these people that are living
today on her fucking stupid cars and all

273
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,880
the ridiculous way that
we look at the world,

274
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:45,830
these crazy fucking people.

275
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:47,300
They didn't have electricity.

276
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:48,950
They didn't have any leadership roles?

277
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:49,620
No,

278
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:51,000
not copper tube.

279
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:56,460
All they can probe when you don't see
that monotherapy drink a five hour fucking

280
00:07:58,251 --> 00:07:59,210
energy like us.

281
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:00,740
Is there anything mobile?

282
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:01,331
Think about that.

283
00:08:01,331 --> 00:08:04,760
Is there anything that makes you respect
a dude less than when he gets into a

284
00:08:04,761 --> 00:08:07,190
Twitter world with his girlfriend online?

285
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:09,020
That's the worst.

286
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:09,680
I don't even know.

287
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:09,861
Why.

288
00:08:09,861 --> 00:08:11,120
Have you seen one recently?

289
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:11,481
God,

290
00:08:11,481 --> 00:08:12,530
I seen a ton of them.

291
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,740
I seen people arguing with
their spouses on Twitter.

292
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:17,540
Jenna Jameson and Tito Ortiz do it.

293
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:19,550
They do like public,

294
00:08:19,551 --> 00:08:21,230
like really public important shit.

295
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:23,080
Get arrested for fucking Twitter.

296
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:25,280
Let me say they do it,

297
00:08:25,281 --> 00:08:26,660
but that's like a publicity thing.

298
00:08:26,661 --> 00:08:27,980
Maybe because there there's,

299
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:28,863
I mean maybe,

300
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:30,080
maybe they're savvy.

301
00:08:30,081 --> 00:08:31,640
Maybe there's celebrity
savvy and you know,

302
00:08:31,641 --> 00:08:32,840
they had to keep her name out there.

303
00:08:32,841 --> 00:08:33,500
I mean that there's,

304
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:33,891
you could,

305
00:08:33,891 --> 00:08:36,710
you could come up with a rational
for a famous person doing it.

306
00:08:36,711 --> 00:08:39,980
I guess if you're one of those famous
people that want to be on a reality show,

307
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,180
you know I can,

308
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:42,050
I can understand,

309
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,860
but I know due to our regular dudes who
are having like Twitter wars with the

310
00:08:45,861 --> 00:08:49,460
girlfriend online with the girlfriend
will say it would be amazing if I had a

311
00:08:49,461 --> 00:08:54,140
man in my life that actually cared about
what I think and then you know the guy

312
00:08:54,141 --> 00:08:55,040
will come back on.

313
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:55,900
It would be amazing.

314
00:08:58,620 --> 00:08:59,370
That'd be smacking.

315
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:01,410
Getting that Dick suck carrying rocks.

316
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,300
We'll fucking day like savages.

317
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:06,630
Me Ask you since she invented shine,

318
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,780
cut the lips to remind you that she suck.

319
00:09:08,781 --> 00:09:10,890
Cock think I'll beat these
fucking what the fuck does it?

320
00:09:10,891 --> 00:09:14,100
But you know what to tell you on the
job roles it might mean that was very

321
00:09:14,101 --> 00:09:14,610
interesting.

322
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:15,060
Google it.

323
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:18,060
We're really part of the AAD society.

324
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:19,620
What is it going to take?

325
00:09:19,621 --> 00:09:21,030
When are people going to talk about us?

326
00:09:21,031 --> 00:09:22,740
Like that was BC,

327
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:27,890
there was aid d then what's
going to happen post nuclear?

328
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:29,780
Maybe it's posted to not be posted on.

329
00:09:29,781 --> 00:09:30,810
I was thinking about this the other day,

330
00:09:30,811 --> 00:09:35,811
how interesting and not that some day
we're going to be what BC is to us post

331
00:09:36,181 --> 00:09:38,640
nuclear makes sense that
they would one day he said,

332
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:39,330
yeah,

333
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:40,530
I would think that makes sense.

334
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,760
Then one day they would just say,

335
00:09:41,761 --> 00:09:42,251
you know what?

336
00:09:42,251 --> 00:09:43,200
What changed everything?

337
00:09:43,201 --> 00:09:43,340
Right.

338
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:44,700
You a piano or an eight beat.

339
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:45,573
Yeah.

340
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:46,771
I don't know dog.

341
00:09:46,771 --> 00:09:47,604
I'll be back.

342
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:50,310
Yeah.

343
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:50,850
What uh,

344
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:51,601
what do you want to be?

345
00:09:51,601 --> 00:09:52,650
How do you want to be defined?

346
00:09:52,651 --> 00:09:53,910
How fucking crazy is that?

347
00:09:53,911 --> 00:09:56,100
That someday we're going
to be part of a di.

348
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,091
He would,

349
00:09:57,091 --> 00:09:58,160
it's going to be something like that.

350
00:09:58,161 --> 00:09:59,130
And you know,

351
00:09:59,190 --> 00:09:59,461
I mean,

352
00:09:59,461 --> 00:09:59,601
no,

353
00:09:59,601 --> 00:10:00,450
same way BC,

354
00:10:00,451 --> 00:10:02,350
I can't even imagine thinking about BC.

355
00:10:02,351 --> 00:10:03,120
Why don't think it'd be silly.

356
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,040
I think of people with sandals were beads,

357
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,121
you know,

358
00:10:06,121 --> 00:10:10,210
smoking fucking trees looked
at a d stand for after death.

359
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:11,480
The Christ dying.

360
00:10:11,481 --> 00:10:12,970
So I don't think so.

361
00:10:12,971 --> 00:10:13,750
I think there's a,

362
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:18,520
I think it's actually a term for something
that it's been sort of accepted along

363
00:10:18,521 --> 00:10:19,354
the way.

364
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:20,320
Yeah.

365
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,220
I'm fucked up.

366
00:10:21,221 --> 00:10:22,720
Already hinted that Joe Rogan,

367
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:25,510
Henry Winkler twittered me or did
you work with him on the movie?

368
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:26,920
That was so amazing.

369
00:10:26,921 --> 00:10:27,161
I was like,

370
00:10:27,161 --> 00:10:27,401
whoa.

371
00:10:27,401 --> 00:10:29,140
Henry Winkler and then went to his page.

372
00:10:29,141 --> 00:10:31,050
He's like only following like 50 people.

373
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:31,601
One was me.

374
00:10:31,601 --> 00:10:31,841
I was like,

375
00:10:31,841 --> 00:10:33,820
what the fuck is going on here?

376
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:34,841
He's a great guy,

377
00:10:34,841 --> 00:10:38,710
said some about bad flavors and we will
all those guys on the set of heard the

378
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,553
podcast

379
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,400
guys who know you guys who often move on.

380
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,730
Henry Henry Winkler is cool as fuck.

381
00:10:45,731 --> 00:10:46,564
Who was loves.

382
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,860
He loves fly fishing.

383
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:49,510
We were talking about fly fishing.

384
00:10:49,511 --> 00:10:53,050
Someone took him fly fish and I think in
the late eighties or early nineties and

385
00:10:53,051 --> 00:10:54,010
he wrote a book called,

386
00:10:54,011 --> 00:10:55,930
I never met an idiot on the river.

387
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:59,380
All about the cool people that he met
fly fishing and he has all these photos

388
00:10:59,381 --> 00:11:01,300
and the books a places
he's gone fly fishing.

389
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:03,340
That's bad ass fishing is fun as fuck man.

390
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:04,450
When I was living in Boulder,

391
00:11:04,451 --> 00:11:07,750
there was a company that would take
you out and I was totally down to go.

392
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,640
I just never had the time before.

393
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,473
We had to move back.

394
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:11,110
But uh,

395
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:11,943
this dude,

396
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:14,470
there was one of those guys that will
like make his own flies and shit.

397
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:17,320
They have like a station
where they sell like feathers,

398
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:21,610
little things and that's like that type
of fishing is a completely different

399
00:11:21,611 --> 00:11:22,444
type of fishing.

400
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:22,841
You know,

401
00:11:22,841 --> 00:11:24,680
it's like there's an art form to it.

402
00:11:24,681 --> 00:11:25,600
It's difficult.

403
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:28,930
Like the art of casting a fly Rod,

404
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:29,980
it's very difficult.

405
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:33,360
It's not like you can't be drunk and
fucked up and yelling with your buddies.

406
00:11:33,361 --> 00:11:34,570
You just dunk align in.

407
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:37,300
So like some of those
guys get a little elitist.

408
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:39,010
Some of those fly Fisher guys,

409
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:40,270
they want to pretend that there's some,

410
00:11:40,271 --> 00:11:43,420
but there is something that's a
little more intimate about it.

411
00:11:43,421 --> 00:11:44,830
Like you make your own little lure,

412
00:11:44,831 --> 00:11:46,270
you make your own little fake bug,

413
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:46,901
you know,

414
00:11:46,901 --> 00:11:50,170
and they have all these different
instructional video tapes on how to make

415
00:11:50,171 --> 00:11:50,950
lures.

416
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:55,210
You could find them online and dudes are
like fashioning and a little feathers

417
00:11:55,211 --> 00:11:55,661
and shit.

418
00:11:55,661 --> 00:11:57,370
And that's something crafty about that.

419
00:11:57,371 --> 00:11:58,800
You cast it out or catch a big

420
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:00,130
Stephanie Lockhart does.

421
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:01,371
He's into all that.

422
00:12:01,371 --> 00:12:04,700
He just went fishing the other day
at echo park or something like that.

423
00:12:04,701 --> 00:12:05,451
I didn't catch anything,

424
00:12:05,451 --> 00:12:05,841
but it's like,

425
00:12:05,841 --> 00:12:08,090
that's crazy fishing it echo park really

426
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:10,583
in a way.

427
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:11,260
What?

428
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:15,270
Silver Lake or the ocean STD of some
sort of hole in a river or whatever the

429
00:12:15,271 --> 00:12:17,940
fuck it's gotta be so
therapeutic for those people.

430
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:19,890
I just don't think I have the patients.

431
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,540
I've done it a thousand times.

432
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:25,190
It's so awesome when
you're catching fish oil,

433
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:26,310
you're not catching fish.

434
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:27,720
It can be such a drag.

435
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:30,990
I've been on fishing trips where
it's like two days of nothing.

436
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:31,621
You know,

437
00:12:31,621 --> 00:12:31,741
you,

438
00:12:31,741 --> 00:12:31,951
you,

439
00:12:31,951 --> 00:12:32,231
you,

440
00:12:32,231 --> 00:12:34,080
you will go with a buddy and then on the,

441
00:12:34,081 --> 00:12:34,540
by the time,

442
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:35,380
second day rolls around,

443
00:12:35,381 --> 00:12:35,551
I'm like,

444
00:12:35,551 --> 00:12:37,020
you still haven't caught shit.

445
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:37,530
You know.

446
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:41,550
But if you go to someplace like
where like salmon or fucking running,

447
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:41,941
you know,

448
00:12:41,941 --> 00:12:44,250
you go to Oregon where the
salmon are running like,

449
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:44,641
Bro,

450
00:12:44,641 --> 00:12:46,830
you're going to catch
some fish caught fish,

451
00:12:46,831 --> 00:12:47,350
salmon,

452
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:48,151
or have you really,

453
00:12:48,151 --> 00:12:49,330
what'd you catch your story?

454
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:50,753
What'd you catch?

455
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:53,750
A couple of fucking savages
and some white things are,

456
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,593
boy Gerald,

457
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:55,970
Eddie's a blackbelt,

458
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:56,873
Gerald's treatment.

459
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:57,620
He loves.

460
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:58,620
He lives up in Oregon.

461
00:12:58,621 --> 00:13:01,170
He goes fishing all the time and he was
telling Mike Pyle was telling us about

462
00:13:01,171 --> 00:13:01,381
it too.

463
00:13:01,381 --> 00:13:01,861
Mike Pyle,

464
00:13:01,861 --> 00:13:03,150
when we were in Portland,

465
00:13:03,151 --> 00:13:04,770
he offered to take us
out on his dad's pub,

466
00:13:04,771 --> 00:13:06,030
but we couldn't stay an extra day.

467
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:10,020
But that Portland supposed
to have something awesome.

468
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,370
I just wish,

469
00:13:11,371 --> 00:13:11,610
you know,

470
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:13,200
sometimes you watch the deadliest catch.

471
00:13:13,201 --> 00:13:14,070
That's a little much.

472
00:13:14,071 --> 00:13:14,904
That's crazy.

473
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:15,481
That's a little,

474
00:13:15,481 --> 00:13:18,690
but those poor motherfuckers
crab is not worth that much.

475
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:20,280
It's not that good.

476
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:21,360
I mean it's okay,

477
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:23,550
but I guess for them though,

478
00:13:23,551 --> 00:13:23,881
look,

479
00:13:23,881 --> 00:13:24,071
it's,

480
00:13:24,071 --> 00:13:26,400
it's worth a fuck load of
money and it's out there.

481
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:27,660
They go out six weeks,

482
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:28,680
right?

483
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,070
Yeah.

484
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:29,281
Eight,

485
00:13:29,281 --> 00:13:29,821
two months.

486
00:13:29,821 --> 00:13:31,380
You come back with 60 grand.

487
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:32,430
Is that what happens?

488
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:35,040
It's not some real money and
they go on three times a year,

489
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:35,890
twice a year.

490
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:36,270
You know,

491
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:36,901
that's real money.

492
00:13:36,901 --> 00:13:41,580
But God damn dangerous
guys fallen that water man.

493
00:13:41,581 --> 00:13:42,420
And that's no joke.

494
00:13:42,421 --> 00:13:43,254
That water,

495
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:43,711
first of all,

496
00:13:43,711 --> 00:13:48,711
that water is so fucking cold that you
only have a couple minutes to live like

497
00:13:49,711 --> 00:13:50,820
you won't live.

498
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:52,710
If you're in the water for
more than a few minutes,

499
00:13:52,711 --> 00:13:54,270
it's just too fucking cold.

500
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:55,680
You're just not going to make it.

501
00:13:55,681 --> 00:13:56,520
Your body is going to,

502
00:13:56,521 --> 00:13:57,480
you're in Alaska,

503
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,310
motherfucker,

504
00:13:58,310 --> 00:13:59,970
you were in the ocean and in Alaska.

505
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,230
Fucking Seattle.

506
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:02,100
Listen,

507
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:02,933
let's be honest.

508
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:04,470
Let's see as honest as we can.

509
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,120
Nobody in this room could tell me,

510
00:14:06,121 --> 00:14:06,921
look at my face and go,

511
00:14:06,921 --> 00:14:08,760
I jumped in at the San
Diego when it was warm.

512
00:14:08,761 --> 00:14:11,070
It's never fucking know before.

513
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:14,220
Now I swam in Oregon
like a fucking Malcolm,

514
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:14,770
that story,

515
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:16,470
cause it's triple used to have a room.

516
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:18,090
But one time I had a jump.

517
00:14:18,091 --> 00:14:18,860
Treble is uh,

518
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:19,140
uh,

519
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:20,010
the booking agent.

520
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:23,640
But one time I jumped into the ocean
because the cops were actually looking for

521
00:14:23,641 --> 00:14:24,570
me in Seattle.

522
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:27,780
Awful fucking owl Chi beach right there.

523
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,880
But he channeled that into the ocean.

524
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:31,670
That fucking stripper.

525
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,740
We used to beat each other
up once a fucking weekend.

526
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:34,583
The conflict,

527
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:35,611
you know what I'm saying?

528
00:14:35,611 --> 00:14:36,570
I stab her.

529
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:37,740
She hit me in the head with a chair.

530
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:41,010
So one night I went over
there on the ecstasy.

531
00:14:41,011 --> 00:14:43,360
I never forget those high end
a piece execute with Josh Wool.

532
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:45,810
This is 1995 I go over there,

533
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:48,810
I started fucking with the lady next
door and knew if I came over to call the

534
00:14:48,811 --> 00:14:49,440
cops.

535
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,550
So I am banging on them.

536
00:14:50,551 --> 00:14:52,010
The cops not going to do and I have kind

537
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:52,431
of a belly.

538
00:14:52,431 --> 00:14:53,264
I went under the bed,

539
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:56,030
the cops are looking at us and they look
under the bed and the bed's going up

540
00:14:56,031 --> 00:14:57,980
and down from fucking Oh yeah,

541
00:14:58,010 --> 00:14:58,900
come on right there.

542
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:01,640
And they arrested me with no shirt on.

543
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,440
So I put the fucking handcuffs on.

544
00:15:03,441 --> 00:15:05,660
I'm on the bus waiting to
go to fucking Seattle jail.

545
00:15:05,661 --> 00:15:06,890
They take them to Seattle jail.

546
00:15:06,891 --> 00:15:07,820
So like a four block.

547
00:15:07,821 --> 00:15:11,150
The ecstasy that I eat at nine in the
morning started hitting me in the fucking

548
00:15:11,151 --> 00:15:11,990
Seattle jail.

549
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:13,010
Oh my God.

550
00:15:13,011 --> 00:15:13,161
Well,

551
00:15:13,161 --> 00:15:15,230
I was hiding to book another time.

552
00:15:15,231 --> 00:15:18,200
I went over there and I tried to sneak
around and they called the cops on me.

553
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:22,520
I actually jumped into the fucking
ocean and I'll tell you what,

554
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:24,060
that water is high bulk.

555
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,010
That's what they should call that.

556
00:15:25,011 --> 00:15:25,970
Beach Hypothermia.

557
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:26,833
That's what it's called.

558
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:27,670
That and I,

559
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:30,200
she used to see people out there
playing soccer in the water,

560
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:30,801
like you know,

561
00:15:30,801 --> 00:15:32,060
playing with a soccer ball out there.

562
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:32,960
What does that volleyball,

563
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:33,081
oh,

564
00:15:33,081 --> 00:15:34,010
they're so crazy.

565
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:36,170
Not even penguins do that shit.

566
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:37,250
That Ocean is,

567
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:39,470
and I've said it before
on this show that out.

568
00:15:39,471 --> 00:15:40,970
That is a place called Bremerton,

569
00:15:40,971 --> 00:15:41,804
Washington.

570
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:43,580
It's where the navy has all their,

571
00:15:43,581 --> 00:15:46,910
we leech before they've
even makes it move.

572
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:47,751
Bremerton.

573
00:15:47,751 --> 00:15:48,830
Washington gets a call.

574
00:15:48,831 --> 00:15:51,770
That's what were some marines come
out because it's the deepest part.

575
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:52,611
Oh yeah,

576
00:15:52,611 --> 00:15:53,151
that's right.

577
00:15:53,151 --> 00:15:54,500
We had this discussion before.

578
00:15:54,501 --> 00:15:55,880
It's where they go all the way down.

579
00:15:55,881 --> 00:15:56,331
You can't,

580
00:15:56,331 --> 00:15:57,170
they go like right.

581
00:15:57,171 --> 00:15:57,981
It goes like right.

582
00:15:57,981 --> 00:15:58,814
Drops right off,

583
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:01,460
right under jock who stolen shit.

584
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,630
So the Russians,

585
00:16:02,631 --> 00:16:03,290
the Japs,

586
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:06,150
nobody could trace that
shit deep from that.

587
00:16:06,151 --> 00:16:06,561
They're all,

588
00:16:06,561 --> 00:16:08,060
those motherfuckers are
living in Bremerton.

589
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,190
Nobody gives you that.

590
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:12,350
They have submarines are the biggest mind.

591
00:16:12,351 --> 00:16:13,590
Fuck ever.

592
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:19,110
Imagine if we were right now in some
sort of a metal tube that is under the

593
00:16:19,341 --> 00:16:22,640
fucking ocean a mile deep.

594
00:16:22,641 --> 00:16:23,870
How deep to those fall?

595
00:16:23,871 --> 00:16:24,580
My God.

596
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:24,770
Oh,

597
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:26,150
and what's the deepest and submarine goes?

598
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:28,320
We have to type it up cause I
don't want to give you a full,

599
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:31,550
do you think it would be like if we
didn't fly as much would think the same

600
00:16:31,551 --> 00:16:32,331
thing about the flying.

601
00:16:32,331 --> 00:16:33,230
Now you're in a metal tube

602
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:34,450
like way up in the sky.

603
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:35,660
The wheel,

604
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:36,840
the fucking bread strip.

605
00:16:36,841 --> 00:16:41,080
We would die because what's that shit
goes into your mind like wait a sec.

606
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:44,330
Who are the little wallet?

607
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:45,320
There's a leak.

608
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:48,770
We'll flop at the bard
is in San Francisco.

609
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:49,850
You know how I found out about,

610
00:16:49,851 --> 00:16:51,890
I've talked about this on
stage in San Francisco,

611
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,060
but it's a true story.

612
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:54,380
I was with fear factor.

613
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:54,621
We were,

614
00:16:54,621 --> 00:16:56,940
we were filming in Oakland and uh,

615
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:58,190
everyone was going to get together,

616
00:16:58,191 --> 00:17:01,520
the crew and everybody was going to
get together and have dinner in San

617
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:01,850
Francisco.

618
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:02,930
And I love those guys.

619
00:17:02,931 --> 00:17:03,470
They're there,

620
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:04,340
they're all fun guys.

621
00:17:04,341 --> 00:17:05,600
I'm super comfortable with them.

622
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:09,770
So I thought it would be way more fun
to do this to get fucking barbecued.

623
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:14,360
So I eat this fucking cookie
in my room and I am on pollute.

624
00:17:14,361 --> 00:17:15,194
Oh Dude.

625
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:19,490
It's one of those cookies where he
started having very mild hallucinations,

626
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,600
like trails,

627
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,640
like there'll be trails
when people are moving,

628
00:17:22,641 --> 00:17:26,120
you'll see like little bits of light
following behind them and I'm starting to

629
00:17:26,121 --> 00:17:28,550
see things that aren't
there necessarily like a,

630
00:17:28,570 --> 00:17:28,960
I'll,

631
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:29,151
I'll,

632
00:17:29,151 --> 00:17:31,610
I'll start to see like
movement in front of people.

633
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:32,211
It doesn't exist.

634
00:17:32,211 --> 00:17:34,670
I mean I was fucking gone man.

635
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:36,770
I was like way too high
to be out in public.

636
00:17:36,771 --> 00:17:37,604
I was having like,

637
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:42,470
I was having some sort of a membrane
moment where I'm like on the brink of

638
00:17:42,471 --> 00:17:44,360
passing through to some other dimension.

639
00:17:44,361 --> 00:17:45,560
It's like right next to us,

640
00:17:45,561 --> 00:17:48,800
but we can't normally
access pat fucking hot.

641
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:49,160
Wow.

642
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:49,401
I mean,

643
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:50,280
I'm way too.

644
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:55,530
And then all of a sudden we're in this
bar thing and my ears are popping and so

645
00:17:55,531 --> 00:17:56,010
I go,

646
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:57,420
why are my ears popping?

647
00:17:57,421 --> 00:17:58,440
Why aren't my ears popping?

648
00:17:58,830 --> 00:17:59,391
And whether you got,

649
00:17:59,391 --> 00:17:59,611
he goes,

650
00:17:59,611 --> 00:17:59,850
Huh?

651
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:00,500
You don't know.

652
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,040
Or 500 feet of the ocean right now

653
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:09,000
and all I could think of is what a dumb
way to die and how scary that would be

654
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:13,890
if that thing just started moving and
it was a leak broke and then the water

655
00:18:13,891 --> 00:18:15,090
comes rushing in.

656
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:20,480
What a nutty idea to put a fucking tube
under the ocean in a place where the

657
00:18:20,761 --> 00:18:23,630
ground is famous for movie half.

658
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,480
Fuck that.

659
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:25,860
How long has that been open?

660
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:27,180
A long time.

661
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:28,080
It's a camp.

662
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:28,771
It's a come on.

663
00:18:28,771 --> 00:18:29,520
Seven thing.

664
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,001
Come on.

665
00:18:30,001 --> 00:18:31,260
Seven every time they get to the end.

666
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:31,990
Yes,

667
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:34,230
and it's like the same
thing with Jack Japan man.

668
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,880
So same thing with this
nuclear power plant.

669
00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:36,120
Come on.

670
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:36,970
They said it can.

671
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:40,680
You can avoid up to an 8.2 I think we're
going to be good while sudden they're

672
00:18:40,681 --> 00:18:41,514
nine hits.

673
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:42,623
Boom.

674
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:44,430
This bart system,

675
00:18:44,431 --> 00:18:45,181
what does a good for?

676
00:18:45,181 --> 00:18:48,650
Is it good for a five is a good for a
seven we're pretty sure it can survive as

677
00:18:48,651 --> 00:18:52,680
seven would if it's a nine what if you're
in there and it's one of those five

678
00:18:52,681 --> 00:18:57,681
minute jammies where the whole fucking
Dang is going for five minutes.

679
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:01,110
You are just shit your pants.

680
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:04,720
How much can this little
flexible metal tube underwater,

681
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:05,850
how long can this last?

682
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:07,170
How much can it hold?

683
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:07,520
What did,

684
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:12,520
what did the insane pressures it's
experiencing every foot of the way as it's

685
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:15,750
anchored down to this moving ground.

686
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:21,540
Ocean is moving in a tsunami fashion
over it as well because wherever the fuck

687
00:19:22,141 --> 00:19:27,141
the epicenter of it that the shelf lifts
up in a fucking giant 500 foot wall of

688
00:19:28,231 --> 00:19:30,450
water going 50,000 miles an hour.

689
00:19:30,451 --> 00:19:31,340
It's headed to the coast.

690
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:32,930
Shit man

691
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:33,291
fuel.

692
00:19:33,291 --> 00:19:34,770
If they want to get on the Lincoln tunnel.

693
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:35,663
Yeah,

694
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:37,440
I get out the fucking,

695
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:39,630
you know they say here when
you get on the train in La,

696
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:42,090
they built it a certain
way so it has barriers.

697
00:19:42,091 --> 00:19:43,290
Even if there is an earthquake,

698
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:45,390
it bounces off the fucking things.

699
00:19:45,391 --> 00:19:45,951
Let me tell you something.

700
00:19:45,951 --> 00:19:50,680
Every morning I kiss my wife and I
say a fucking pray overpass Jack,

701
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,110
or worse under one.

702
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:53,400
We saw those pictures.

703
00:19:53,401 --> 00:19:57,660
Those pictures from 94 were shit was
flattened with a top level fell on the

704
00:19:57,661 --> 00:19:58,590
bottom level.

705
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,900
It's fucking crazy man.

706
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:02,670
And we live here every morning I get up,

707
00:20:02,671 --> 00:20:03,001
I could go,

708
00:20:03,001 --> 00:20:04,540
this could be the last mother fucker.

709
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:05,903
This could be,

710
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:09,930
I think about it every day type thing
like like the grocery store last night I

711
00:20:09,931 --> 00:20:11,280
was thinking about it when I was at,

712
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:13,230
I had a whole thing of
grocery store card and like,

713
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:13,561
all right,

714
00:20:13,561 --> 00:20:15,090
if it happened now at
least I have a bunch of.

715
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:16,350
Meanwhile,

716
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:17,130
by the way,

717
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:20,730
were pussies compared to these
people that live in like Alabama.

718
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:22,320
These people in Joplin,

719
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:22,981
Missouri,

720
00:20:22,981 --> 00:20:26,790
where three quarters of
the town just disappeared,

721
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:28,530
just disappeared.

722
00:20:28,531 --> 00:20:29,010
Man.

723
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:34,010
They said that the tornado when
it touched down was miles wide.

724
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:35,850
Do you not crazy.

725
00:20:35,851 --> 00:20:37,510
That is miles.

726
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:38,520
Why Joey?

727
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,980
So it literally is like a giant array,

728
00:20:40,981 --> 00:20:41,281
sir.

729
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:46,230
On a chalkboard just erasing
giant swaths of land.

730
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:49,090
Feet Times nine common action.

731
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,080
We used to have a ton
of tornadoes in Ohio.

732
00:20:51,081 --> 00:20:52,310
That's one thing I don't miss.

733
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:52,910
But uh,

734
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:53,680
California.

735
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,620
Have you ever seen that?

736
00:20:54,621 --> 00:20:54,771
Yeah,

737
00:20:54,771 --> 00:20:55,850
we talked about how he got shit.

738
00:20:55,851 --> 00:20:58,760
We got chased once on the way home
from an amusement park in a bus.

739
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:02,330
There was one chasing our bus and we
were in high school or middle school or

740
00:21:02,331 --> 00:21:03,050
something.

741
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:05,960
There was one in California
though the other day lately.

742
00:21:05,961 --> 00:21:07,430
Rare Sacramento.

743
00:21:07,431 --> 00:21:08,264
Sacramento

744
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:09,721
for this.

745
00:21:09,721 --> 00:21:10,381
They had one.

746
00:21:10,381 --> 00:21:11,400
They reported in La,

747
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:12,151
not in la,

748
00:21:12,151 --> 00:21:12,990
but la area.

749
00:21:12,991 --> 00:21:13,980
Southern California.

750
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:14,731
It was recent,

751
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:15,840
like the last five,

752
00:21:15,841 --> 00:21:17,160
six years or something crazy.

753
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:19,040
We see that I seen on
the news they showed up.

754
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:19,480
Yeah.

755
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:23,150
And then it snowed two days ago in
Sacramento or three days ago in soccer.

756
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:23,610
Yeah.

757
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:25,530
I was reading Josh Berkeley's Twitter yet.

758
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:27,090
If it was yesterday or last night,

759
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,250
maybe might might've been
this morning where he said,

760
00:21:29,251 --> 00:21:31,410
I can't believe there's
fucking snow on my front yard.

761
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:33,390
Like the getting snow in Utah Right now.

762
00:21:33,391 --> 00:21:36,840
Still you think the government's
fucker would all weather system.

763
00:21:36,841 --> 00:21:37,980
We didn't call these balloons.

764
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,750
Something's gotta be going on in guys.

765
00:21:39,751 --> 00:21:42,360
I don't know if that's what's
responsible for all this.

766
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:42,961
I think it's fun.

767
00:21:42,961 --> 00:21:46,360
I do know that they're definitely fucking
with the weather guys don't know this

768
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:47,220
responsible,

769
00:21:47,221 --> 00:21:48,031
those tornadoes,

770
00:21:48,031 --> 00:21:48,990
a deadly guys.

771
00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:49,501
It's true.

772
00:21:49,501 --> 00:21:50,161
But you know,

773
00:21:50,161 --> 00:21:55,080
we only have a very limited number
of years that we can study a very,

774
00:21:55,081 --> 00:21:56,730
very complex system.

775
00:21:57,050 --> 00:21:57,230
The,

776
00:21:57,230 --> 00:21:57,441
the,

777
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:57,751
the,

778
00:21:57,751 --> 00:21:59,040
the system of the,

779
00:21:59,041 --> 00:22:01,200
the balance of the ecosystem of the earth,

780
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:02,460
like where it's warm,

781
00:22:02,461 --> 00:22:03,450
where it's stormy,

782
00:22:03,451 --> 00:22:03,721
where,

783
00:22:03,721 --> 00:22:03,931
you know,

784
00:22:03,931 --> 00:22:06,840
where were thing that
shit moves and changes,

785
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:07,321
you know,

786
00:22:07,321 --> 00:22:08,580
there's parts of like,

787
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:09,311
it's one of the,

788
00:22:09,311 --> 00:22:09,421
uh,

789
00:22:09,421 --> 00:22:13,620
the big pieces of evidence
that they point to a much,

790
00:22:13,621 --> 00:22:18,150
much older Egyptian society is that
Egypt at one point in time where the Nile

791
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:18,451
River was,

792
00:22:18,451 --> 00:22:18,931
where the,

793
00:22:18,931 --> 00:22:21,960
like the Sphinx is 9,000 years ago,

794
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:23,850
that was a tropical rain forest,

795
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:25,080
like 9,000 BC.

796
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,120
And there's like all this water erosion
on the Sphinx and the instincts and

797
00:22:29,121 --> 00:22:32,910
closure and some of the scientists use
that as a point to evidence that they

798
00:22:32,911 --> 00:22:36,660
need to reconsider the age of the
Egyptian culture because this is like a

799
00:22:36,661 --> 00:22:37,980
completely different environments.

800
00:22:37,981 --> 00:22:40,680
This was under initially as opposed
to when they found everything,

801
00:22:40,681 --> 00:22:41,210
which was,

802
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:42,780
it was all desert and
they were saying like,

803
00:22:42,781 --> 00:22:43,201
this is like,

804
00:22:43,201 --> 00:22:43,441
wait,

805
00:22:43,441 --> 00:22:43,591
wait,

806
00:22:43,591 --> 00:22:43,741
wait,

807
00:22:43,741 --> 00:22:45,420
wait way older than you think it is.

808
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:46,470
Like we don't know.

809
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:51,090
We don't really know like
the real disasters that
happened 20 30,000 years ago.

810
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:53,310
Like they just found it Lantis in Spain,

811
00:22:53,311 --> 00:22:54,990
it was reading about it in Time magazine.

812
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:59,610
They're almost positive that they've
found the actual area where Atlantis was

813
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:04,140
and it guess what it is in Spain and
it was hit by a fucking giant tsunami,

814
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:06,030
3000 something BC.

815
00:23:06,090 --> 00:23:06,780
And that's a wrap.

816
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:08,640
The whole thing just changes,

817
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:09,211
you know?

818
00:23:09,211 --> 00:23:09,601
And that's,

819
00:23:09,601 --> 00:23:11,730
that happens for everywhere on the planet.

820
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:17,060
So we have such a limited number of years
where we're sort of analyzing data as

821
00:23:18,031 --> 00:23:19,370
far as changing of,

822
00:23:19,371 --> 00:23:20,520
of the climate of the earth.

823
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:21,630
North America,

824
00:23:21,631 --> 00:23:23,130
just 10,000 years ago,

825
00:23:23,131 --> 00:23:24,930
a blink of an eye north America,

826
00:23:24,931 --> 00:23:27,810
half of it was under a mile of ice.

827
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,210
That's just 10,000 years ago,

828
00:23:30,211 --> 00:23:30,511
man.

829
00:23:30,511 --> 00:23:31,620
In terms of the earth,

830
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,513
that ain't shit.

831
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:34,710
10,000 years ago there
was people just like you.

832
00:23:34,711 --> 00:23:36,390
And I indistinguishable.

833
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:37,530
They could be at a movie theater.

834
00:23:37,531 --> 00:23:38,281
You wouldn't be able to tell,

835
00:23:38,281 --> 00:23:39,360
put them in new people clothes.

836
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:43,740
They were the same as us and yet North
America was under a half a mile of ice,

837
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:44,611
you know?

838
00:23:44,611 --> 00:23:46,280
So there's sorts of shit that happens

839
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,360
that we don't know about.

840
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:47,710
We,

841
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:48,411
we know,

842
00:23:48,411 --> 00:23:51,620
we know we have ice core samples and
we know that we've gone through some

843
00:23:51,621 --> 00:23:53,700
cooling periods and warming periods that,

844
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:54,950
but shit,

845
00:23:54,951 --> 00:23:55,340
man,

846
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:55,701
you know,

847
00:23:55,701 --> 00:23:56,041
there's,

848
00:23:56,041 --> 00:24:00,080
there's a giant mystery is to hold it
this whole cycle of the earth and whether

849
00:24:00,081 --> 00:24:00,381
or not,

850
00:24:00,381 --> 00:24:00,531
you know,

851
00:24:00,531 --> 00:24:02,990
human beings are interrupting
it with global warming,

852
00:24:02,991 --> 00:24:05,870
whether it's man made or whether
it's just a natural cyclical thing.

853
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:06,590
We,

854
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:06,920
there's,

855
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:07,221
you know,

856
00:24:07,221 --> 00:24:10,460
there's a that you can argue one way or
the other and most scientists believe

857
00:24:10,461 --> 00:24:11,960
what we're doing is not good.

858
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:14,560
But the bottom line is it changes
on its own no matter what.

859
00:24:14,561 --> 00:24:15,740
It changed for the dinosaurs.

860
00:24:15,741 --> 00:24:17,090
It changed for everything.

861
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,020
Everything.

862
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:18,590
That book.

863
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:22,340
Not only do we evolve with the planet
evolves and 300 years we might be on the

864
00:24:22,341 --> 00:24:23,250
fucking ice heat,

865
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:28,100
probably will be an article be the hot
fucking the Rio de Janeiro with the

866
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:28,953
Saunders.

867
00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:30,120
Yeah,

868
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,760
it's the,

869
00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:32,810
well they said that the,

870
00:24:32,811 --> 00:24:33,240
the,

871
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,420
the North Pole is moving,

872
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:36,560
the poll is moving,

873
00:24:36,561 --> 00:24:39,500
set some weird rate of
like 40 miles a year.

874
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:43,130
It's going gonna take a long time a year.

875
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:46,190
But the like there's some sort of a,

876
00:24:46,191 --> 00:24:46,780
I mean it's,

877
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:49,430
it's a natural system and
it constantly moves slowly,

878
00:24:49,431 --> 00:24:51,110
slowly in a certain direction.

879
00:24:51,111 --> 00:24:53,060
But they've had to like recalibrate land,

880
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:56,480
landing strips and Florida rarely because,

881
00:24:56,481 --> 00:24:56,811
yeah,

882
00:24:56,811 --> 00:24:57,650
because of the fucking,

883
00:24:57,651 --> 00:24:58,550
the moving of,

884
00:24:58,551 --> 00:24:59,630
of of the Poles,

885
00:24:59,660 --> 00:24:59,950
it's,

886
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:00,500
it's all,

887
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,450
it's shit is constantly changing mat.

888
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:03,620
Like this Japan thing,

889
00:25:03,621 --> 00:25:03,801
man,

890
00:25:03,801 --> 00:25:05,690
I feel terrible for those people.

891
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:10,550
I feel it's terrible that these scientists
built this thing and didn't really

892
00:25:10,551 --> 00:25:14,690
think it totally through and didn't
really know that if you fuck this up,

893
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:17,270
you leave a sun in the
middle of the field,

894
00:25:17,271 --> 00:25:19,940
it's going to burn through the fucking
earth and you can never shut it off.

895
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:22,520
Don't we have that in the United
States so they have it all over.

896
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:22,910
Of course.

897
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:23,780
It's not just Japan,

898
00:25:23,781 --> 00:25:24,290
it's us.

899
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:25,180
We do gentlemen,

900
00:25:25,181 --> 00:25:26,110
this is a wanting thing.

901
00:25:26,111 --> 00:25:27,380
United States in the United States.

902
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:27,600
None.

903
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:27,750
No.

904
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:28,583
God's about this.

905
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:30,650
They're not even seeing
this for what this is.

906
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:31,311
You know what?

907
00:25:31,311 --> 00:25:35,420
We have the most nuclear plants and
plants that anybody in the fucking world

908
00:25:35,421 --> 00:25:38,060
right here in the United States
and one of these tornadoes,

909
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:38,660
anything.

910
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:39,650
We're just getting a warning,

911
00:25:39,651 --> 00:25:40,490
which we're fucking,

912
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:41,890
we're not even worried about it.

913
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:42,441
It's again,

914
00:25:42,441 --> 00:25:44,510
the same thing is with
with climate change,

915
00:25:44,511 --> 00:25:45,680
we don't have that much data.

916
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,590
We have way more data on climate change
that we do and what happens when you

917
00:25:48,591 --> 00:25:50,210
keep a nuclear power plant around?

918
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:51,111
We know a few.

919
00:25:51,111 --> 00:25:51,820
We know Chernobyl,

920
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:54,650
we know three mile island and now
we know all this shit in Japan,

921
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:57,890
but we don't even know exactly
how long that thing stays active.

922
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:59,750
We don't know how long
it takes to cool off.

923
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:01,490
We don't know how long exactly.

924
00:26:01,491 --> 00:26:02,360
It's radioactive.

925
00:26:02,361 --> 00:26:03,240
There's always just done.

926
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:03,860
It's there.

927
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:04,400
It's there,

928
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,570
but it's thousands of years.

929
00:26:05,571 --> 00:26:05,781
Man.

930
00:26:05,781 --> 00:26:06,990
Everybody agrees on that.

931
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,360
It's thousands of years.

932
00:26:08,361 --> 00:26:10,420
So that area is far hooked up.

933
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:11,670
When you live in Colorado,

934
00:26:11,671 --> 00:26:14,420
did you hear much about rocky
flats was in a paper much?

935
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:14,781
No,

936
00:26:14,781 --> 00:26:15,261
I didn't.

937
00:26:15,261 --> 00:26:17,600
Rocky flats is the big place in Colorado,

938
00:26:17,601 --> 00:26:19,960
which people have died
over cause you know,

939
00:26:19,961 --> 00:26:20,581
the Colorado,

940
00:26:20,581 --> 00:26:22,460
all you need is a fucking
movement in boulder.

941
00:26:22,970 --> 00:26:26,400
They would walk up to the road and
blocking light themselves on fire.

942
00:26:26,401 --> 00:26:27,280
Rocky flats is,

943
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:27,791
you know,

944
00:26:27,791 --> 00:26:28,100
it's uh,

945
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:28,341
you know,

946
00:26:28,341 --> 00:26:30,230
everybody talks about golden scores.

947
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,900
The other side of the
fucking Matt is rocky flats.

948
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:37,730
If you want to look at the golden
being good for growing the Rado cores.

949
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:39,440
So everybody's happy,

950
00:26:39,441 --> 00:26:40,191
everybody's happy.

951
00:26:40,191 --> 00:26:40,851
Oh my God,

952
00:26:40,851 --> 00:26:41,180
cool.

953
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:41,391
You know,

954
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:42,080
we have jobs.

955
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,940
Well next to it is rocky flats,

956
00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:46,081
which is,

957
00:26:46,081 --> 00:26:46,600
you know,

958
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:49,500
why'd you put it in this beautiful
fucking part of the world?

959
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:49,920
You know,

960
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:50,850
what is rocky flats?

961
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:52,860
Rocky flats a nuclear fucking John,

962
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:53,260
I think thing.

963
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:54,270
Is it a power plant?

964
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:55,060
I'm not sure.

965
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:55,751
The double check,

966
00:26:55,751 --> 00:26:57,120
so I don't stick my foot in my mouth.

967
00:26:57,121 --> 00:26:57,954
This is the Joe Rogan.

968
00:26:57,980 --> 00:26:58,620
What's it called again?

969
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:01,990
Rocky when rocky flats just put
rocky flats and see what comes.

970
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:07,040
It's a strip club man trainees
and some dirty fucking,

971
00:27:08,071 --> 00:27:08,904
it's a plant.

972
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,190
It's a nuclear weapons
production facility.

973
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:11,850
Wow.

974
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:13,030
You have no fucking idea.

975
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:13,883
Crazy shit.

976
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:15,600
That's page of the prairie.

977
00:27:15,601 --> 00:27:18,030
Close their nuclear weapons they make.

978
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:22,240
They make the fucking Bhagavad Gita
right there and that explains the airport

979
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:25,470
about that stuff living there.

980
00:27:25,530 --> 00:27:27,080
It's at the craziest expression ever.

981
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:30,810
Duncan Trussell told us
that when Oppenheimer,

982
00:27:30,811 --> 00:27:32,850
when the first nuclear bomb was detonated,

983
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:35,160
he quoted the ancient Hindu scripture,

984
00:27:35,161 --> 00:27:36,180
the Bhagavad Gita.

985
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,390
He said,

986
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:38,230
I am.

987
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:39,720
I am.

988
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:42,450
I am become God destroyer of worlds.

989
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,500
Is that the exact quote?

990
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:45,540
I should know his exact quote,

991
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:50,460
but just the fact that he did that
man that he quoted this ancient Hindu

992
00:27:50,461 --> 00:27:55,461
scripture when he came up
with some machine that cuts
through the fabric or the

993
00:27:55,801 --> 00:27:57,060
fucking universe,

994
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:59,180
it makes everything exploded.

995
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:01,070
It just disappear around.

996
00:28:01,071 --> 00:28:01,904
The

997
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:07,230
rocky flats was a very sore spot in a
beautiful part of the fucking country,

998
00:28:07,231 --> 00:28:08,100
which is Colorado.

999
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:10,081
I'll be granted,

1000
00:28:10,081 --> 00:28:11,250
there is nothing out there,

1001
00:28:11,251 --> 00:28:11,700
Joe.

1002
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:14,500
You pull up your car and there's
God's there with fucking guns.

1003
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:18,300
Zucker's I am become
death destroyer of worlds.

1004
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:20,560
That's your death here.

1005
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:22,980
Pull this up because it's him saying it.

1006
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:24,990
Just pull up Oppenheimer.

1007
00:28:24,991 --> 00:28:29,220
I am become death to destroyer of worlds
cause it's crazy listening to this

1008
00:28:29,221 --> 00:28:29,551
dude.

1009
00:28:29,551 --> 00:28:30,384
Say it.

1010
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:32,580
[inaudible] guys located.

1011
00:28:32,581 --> 00:28:33,730
Do you remember what the saying was?

1012
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:35,850
Rocky flats is near Denver.

1013
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:36,450
It,

1014
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:37,050
uh,

1015
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:40,140
it's operated from 1952 to 1992.

1016
00:28:40,141 --> 00:28:43,590
It was under the control of the United
States Atomic Energy Commission.

1017
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:45,083
Listen,

1018
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:46,650
this is Oppenheimer.

1019
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:55,560
People were silent,

1020
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,690
tear the Bhagavad Gita,

1021
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:14,673
but

1022
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,820
now I ended up coming the,

1023
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:31,963
by

1024
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,433
the way or another.

1025
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:37,010
Holy Shit.

1026
00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:41,920
Could you imagine the responsibility
that you must feel that were

1027
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:47,040
at least credited as the one man that
without whom the nuclear bomb might have

1028
00:29:47,351 --> 00:29:48,460
never been created.

1029
00:29:49,290 --> 00:29:50,860
It just took eight minutes to say,

1030
00:29:50,861 --> 00:29:51,191
listen,

1031
00:29:51,191 --> 00:29:52,630
I fucked some shit up Jack.

1032
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:53,081
Yeah,

1033
00:29:53,081 --> 00:29:55,440
you do much drama just to
get to the fucking bat.

1034
00:29:55,441 --> 00:29:55,961
When he said,

1035
00:29:55,961 --> 00:29:56,561
come on man,

1036
00:29:56,561 --> 00:29:56,920
you don't,

1037
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,240
you don't think that's fascinating.

1038
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:58,450
Oh,

1039
00:29:58,450 --> 00:30:00,550
that guy's a super duper genius.

1040
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:01,493
Again,

1041
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:03,460
he quotes Hindu scripture.

1042
00:30:03,490 --> 00:30:04,810
I am become death.

1043
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:09,930
The destroyer of worlds and knowing that
what he's done was change everything.

1044
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:15,310
Change everything to the point where you
have some device that you can detonate

1045
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:16,540
that makes everything around.

1046
00:30:16,541 --> 00:30:17,180
It disappeared.

1047
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:17,860
It disappeared,

1048
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:19,630
and there's so much
bigger now than they were.

1049
00:30:19,631 --> 00:30:20,640
There's the fucking months,

1050
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,150
like the power that we have,

1051
00:30:22,151 --> 00:30:23,500
like those Hiroshima ones,

1052
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,281
the Nagasaki went,

1053
00:30:24,281 --> 00:30:25,114
those are okay,

1054
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:28,990
but we got like way stronger shit now
and they're working on shit that's even

1055
00:30:28,991 --> 00:30:29,830
stronger than that.

1056
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:30,131
You know,

1057
00:30:30,131 --> 00:30:32,260
they're working on anti matter weapons.

1058
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:34,570
They're working on anti-matter weapons,

1059
00:30:34,571 --> 00:30:37,480
which would literally
like dissolve matter.

1060
00:30:37,630 --> 00:30:38,470
They would literally,

1061
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:41,290
whatever the fuck form
it takes as a weapon,

1062
00:30:41,291 --> 00:30:45,250
whether it's a bomb or a beam
or it would just everything.

1063
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,050
It would just destroy everything.

1064
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:51,100
It would be like thousands
of times stronger than we
could ever imagine any bomb

1065
00:30:51,101 --> 00:30:51,850
being today,

1066
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:52,960
and maybe even more than that.

1067
00:30:52,961 --> 00:30:54,250
Maybe I'm just coming up with numbers,

1068
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,350
but they don't stop.

1069
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,191
They don't stop.

1070
00:30:57,191 --> 00:30:58,024
They don't stop with,

1071
00:30:58,060 --> 00:30:59,620
they don't stop with nuclear bombs.

1072
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:00,760
They don't stop with this,

1073
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:01,211
this,

1074
00:31:01,211 --> 00:31:01,921
this possible.

1075
00:31:01,921 --> 00:31:02,140
I mean,

1076
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:04,600
if they really can do anti-matter weapons,

1077
00:31:04,601 --> 00:31:05,530
they're not gonna stop with that.

1078
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:06,730
Whatever the next thing is,

1079
00:31:06,731 --> 00:31:07,810
it's going to be even more fun.

1080
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:09,900
Does it just seems like they should stop?

1081
00:31:09,930 --> 00:31:10,470
It should.

1082
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:12,570
It should stop retarded.

1083
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:16,500
I figured out how to kill life as it
stands today with a press of a button

1084
00:31:16,501 --> 00:31:16,790
button.

1085
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:16,990
Right,

1086
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:17,220
right.

1087
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:18,180
What else is worth?

1088
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:20,220
I could dissolve you with a fucking gun.

1089
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:22,440
Go below you to fuck up.

1090
00:31:22,441 --> 00:31:23,550
I'm going to blow you to fuck up.

1091
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:26,750
Why do you think people continue
to push in that direction?

1092
00:31:26,751 --> 00:31:30,620
Is it just that we have this natural
tendency to accelerate everything

1093
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:31,703
king of the hill?

1094
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:32,540
You know,

1095
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:34,230
we want to be bigger than that.

1096
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:36,030
The next person we want to have,

1097
00:31:36,290 --> 00:31:37,123
you know?

1098
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:37,461
Yeah.

1099
00:31:37,461 --> 00:31:40,290
But even in a position where
the United States is right now,

1100
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:42,570
we're not really threatened by anybody.

1101
00:31:42,810 --> 00:31:43,051
I mean,

1102
00:31:43,051 --> 00:31:43,710
there's some other,

1103
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:46,440
there's some other countries that have
nuclear power and there's other countries

1104
00:31:46,441 --> 00:31:47,340
that have strong armies,

1105
00:31:47,341 --> 00:31:48,510
but without a doubt,

1106
00:31:48,511 --> 00:31:51,780
this is the biggest super power the
world has ever known by a long shot.

1107
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:54,720
But we continue to come up with newer,

1108
00:31:54,721 --> 00:31:55,650
crazier shit.

1109
00:31:55,890 --> 00:31:56,131
I mean,

1110
00:31:56,131 --> 00:31:57,930
I guess you have to stay where you at.

1111
00:31:57,990 --> 00:31:58,500
You have to,

1112
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:58,891
you have to,

1113
00:31:58,891 --> 00:31:59,161
you know,

1114
00:31:59,161 --> 00:32:00,170
if you're the big bully your,

1115
00:32:00,171 --> 00:32:01,860
you've got to always
have the biggest stick.

1116
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:03,330
You have always be ready.

1117
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:05,310
Always be ready for those
motherfuckers coming up.

1118
00:32:05,311 --> 00:32:05,790
Keep them,

1119
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:06,660
keep them down.

1120
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:08,460
Keep our fucking way of life.

1121
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:09,840
And who was memorial day?

1122
00:32:10,050 --> 00:32:11,040
That's what our troops,

1123
00:32:11,041 --> 00:32:11,874
boys,

1124
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:12,783
God.

1125
00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:13,770
But God damn man,

1126
00:32:13,771 --> 00:32:14,021
when you,

1127
00:32:14,021 --> 00:32:16,140
when you really fucking think
about it like where does it end?

1128
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:16,561
You know,

1129
00:32:16,561 --> 00:32:20,040
I mean I know they thought about this
shit when he was saying that when he was

1130
00:32:20,041 --> 00:32:20,670
saying this,

1131
00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:21,001
you know,

1132
00:32:21,001 --> 00:32:22,770
I am become death to story of worlds.

1133
00:32:22,771 --> 00:32:27,060
He was terrified with the fuck had he
done with the fuck even when he was

1134
00:32:27,061 --> 00:32:28,790
fucking doing can imagine
going to pink berry.

1135
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:29,880
What the fuck he was doing.

1136
00:32:29,881 --> 00:32:30,840
Of course he did Joey.

1137
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:33,210
But what it's also one
of those things with,

1138
00:32:33,211 --> 00:32:34,110
with scientists,

1139
00:32:34,111 --> 00:32:34,440
man,

1140
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:38,940
they are scientists because they are
inherently incredibly curious people

1141
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,480
curious and they're fucking
genius and they want,

1142
00:32:41,481 --> 00:32:42,860
it's amazing your things out.

1143
00:32:42,861 --> 00:32:45,020
And if there is a problem
presented to them,

1144
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:45,350
it,

1145
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:45,710
you know,

1146
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:46,280
it's like,

1147
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:46,540
like,

1148
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:48,320
can you develop a nuclear bomb?

1149
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,370
Can I,

1150
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:49,761
I don't know.

1151
00:32:49,761 --> 00:32:50,300
Can I?

1152
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:51,080
Hmm.

1153
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,580
I think I think we can.

1154
00:32:52,850 --> 00:32:53,061
I said,

1155
00:32:53,061 --> 00:32:53,151
well,

1156
00:32:53,151 --> 00:32:53,540
yeah.

1157
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:54,080
And you know,

1158
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:54,431
it's the,

1159
00:32:54,431 --> 00:32:57,980
the natural inclination whether or
not it's used or not is to create it.

1160
00:32:58,130 --> 00:32:59,450
And you can always justify it by saying,

1161
00:32:59,451 --> 00:32:59,571
well,

1162
00:32:59,571 --> 00:33:02,750
we have to create it first because if
we don't create it first than the Nazis

1163
00:33:02,751 --> 00:33:03,171
will get it.

1164
00:33:03,171 --> 00:33:04,280
And then the fuck everybody up.

1165
00:33:04,370 --> 00:33:05,203
That's all you need.

1166
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,021
And then everybody says,

1167
00:33:06,021 --> 00:33:06,350
okay,

1168
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:06,950
let's make it,

1169
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:07,820
and it's right.

1170
00:33:07,821 --> 00:33:08,390
It's true.

1171
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:08,720
Look,

1172
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,930
the world is way better with America
running things and of Nazi Germany had

1173
00:33:11,931 --> 00:33:13,910
taken over in 1947 hopefully.

1174
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,500
Hopefully it's way better now.

1175
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:16,820
Who knows?

1176
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:17,601
But Shit,

1177
00:33:17,601 --> 00:33:18,434
man,

1178
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:19,910
when does it end?

1179
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:21,650
When do we figure this out?

1180
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,420
Do you remember when you
were a kid in Vietnam ended?

1181
00:33:23,421 --> 00:33:24,254
Do you remember it?

1182
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:26,703
How old were you?

1183
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:28,560
Five.

1184
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:28,991
Seven,

1185
00:33:28,991 --> 00:33:31,060
maybe six hours due to this country.

1186
00:33:31,061 --> 00:33:31,870
So I didn't really,

1187
00:33:31,870 --> 00:33:32,351
I was,

1188
00:33:32,351 --> 00:33:33,510
wasn't America dog,

1189
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:34,120
right.

1190
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:34,811
How long would it be?

1191
00:33:34,811 --> 00:33:36,990
You been in America for years,

1192
00:33:37,010 --> 00:33:37,540
so I didn't,

1193
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:40,540
I was just happy to be having to
give a fuck who were beaten up.

1194
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:42,070
I was living in San Francisco.

1195
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:42,370
I,

1196
00:33:42,370 --> 00:33:43,240
so you've seen it,

1197
00:33:43,241 --> 00:33:43,510
you know,

1198
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:44,710
you've seen the other half of it.

1199
00:33:44,711 --> 00:33:46,210
You've seen the demonstrations and

1200
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:48,560
I was a little bit since
a little kid though,

1201
00:33:48,561 --> 00:33:49,860
I didn't understand any of it.

1202
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:50,301
You know,

1203
00:33:50,301 --> 00:33:51,380
I saw demonstrations.

1204
00:33:51,381 --> 00:33:51,681
It was just,

1205
00:33:51,681 --> 00:33:52,970
to me like the gay pride parade.

1206
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:53,601
It was just like,

1207
00:33:53,601 --> 00:33:53,691
oh,

1208
00:33:53,691 --> 00:33:55,160
there's a bunch of people doing
something and I don't know.

1209
00:33:55,210 --> 00:33:55,880
Stand.

1210
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:56,440
I don't know.

1211
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,940
I was dripping down my mom's leg.

1212
00:33:58,130 --> 00:33:58,963
Are you?

1213
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:01,150
I've never understood war anymore.

1214
00:34:01,151 --> 00:34:03,970
I've never understood all these lives.

1215
00:34:03,971 --> 00:34:05,320
To get your point across.

1216
00:34:05,321 --> 00:34:06,310
I have a disagreement.

1217
00:34:06,490 --> 00:34:07,670
I never understood this,

1218
00:34:07,671 --> 00:34:11,140
and I understand there's
going to be disagreements
between countries is going to

1219
00:34:11,141 --> 00:34:11,974
be radicals.

1220
00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:15,700
I don't like all these lives to
figure to make your fucking point.

1221
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:18,640
That's what I've never
really enjoyed about war.

1222
00:34:18,970 --> 00:34:19,751
But on the other hand,

1223
00:34:19,751 --> 00:34:21,550
war was cash wore.

1224
00:34:21,551 --> 00:34:22,361
His economy.

1225
00:34:22,361 --> 00:34:24,250
War is manufacturing.

1226
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:24,871
You know,

1227
00:34:24,871 --> 00:34:25,990
that's what America does.

1228
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:26,741
That's what we do.

1229
00:34:26,741 --> 00:34:27,101
We get,

1230
00:34:27,101 --> 00:34:27,934
you know,

1231
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:30,720
so I hold a fucking mind to be pro.

1232
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:33,970
My con is I don't want to all these
people losing their fucking lives.

1233
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:35,650
You want the oil motherfucker,

1234
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:36,633
go get it.

1235
00:34:36,910 --> 00:34:38,440
You want the cash that he had?

1236
00:34:38,441 --> 00:34:39,190
Go get it.

1237
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:40,630
You want this month and go get it.

1238
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:43,990
That's one thing that we've always had
the resources to do and that's where I

1239
00:34:43,991 --> 00:34:45,040
don't have patients.

1240
00:34:45,430 --> 00:34:47,830
Why all of these fucking 18 year old kids?

1241
00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:51,880
I don't know who watched apocalypse
now yesterday unplugged on AMC.

1242
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:52,961
You get stoned.

1243
00:34:52,961 --> 00:34:53,950
You walked through the house.

1244
00:34:53,951 --> 00:34:57,430
You have an hour before you go to a
barbecue and you put something on them.

1245
00:34:57,460 --> 00:34:59,700
Fucking sitting there
and I'm sitting at Mt.

1246
00:34:59,701 --> 00:35:04,530
When I was 18 I rob this guy and I used
to do fucking coke and these kids would

1247
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:07,150
19 waking up to machine gun fire.

1248
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:08,320
Are you fucking,

1249
00:35:08,321 --> 00:35:10,090
what are you going to fucking tell me?

1250
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:14,740
What do you have to tell me that you
had a crack problem that you smoked weed

1251
00:35:14,741 --> 00:35:15,330
when you oh,

1252
00:35:15,330 --> 00:35:19,240
be do these kids woke up the
fucking machine gun fire,

1253
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:20,890
they legs getting blown up.

1254
00:35:20,891 --> 00:35:23,260
Just seeing these people and pieces.

1255
00:35:23,261 --> 00:35:24,430
You know what that does to you.

1256
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,590
I would never want to see that.

1257
00:35:26,591 --> 00:35:29,860
I would never want my children or
anybody involved in my life to see that.

1258
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:31,300
That ain't no coming back.

1259
00:35:31,301 --> 00:35:33,430
When you see that type
of death at that age,

1260
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:36,100
I think we don't understand
like no fucking idea.

1261
00:35:36,101 --> 00:35:38,700
I don't like that people
suffering for your point,

1262
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:39,361
Brian.

1263
00:35:39,361 --> 00:35:40,230
I don't like what you're doing.

1264
00:35:40,231 --> 00:35:43,140
I'm about to send the fucking
missile that's so strong.

1265
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:45,810
It's going to go in your house and knock
on your door bell going your asshole

1266
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:46,663
and you're gonna blow up.

1267
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:48,030
That impress me.

1268
00:35:48,930 --> 00:35:53,930
But I don't want 18 million fucking
18 year olds going down for no reason.

1269
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:55,140
It's not just that,

1270
00:35:55,141 --> 00:35:55,411
man.

1271
00:35:55,411 --> 00:35:58,170
That's the a minor thing in
comparison to the casualties.

1272
00:35:58,440 --> 00:35:59,490
They suffer in Iraq.

1273
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:00,031
I mean,

1274
00:36:00,031 --> 00:36:00,840
there's nothing.

1275
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:01,051
Oh,

1276
00:36:01,051 --> 00:36:01,261
what?

1277
00:36:01,261 --> 00:36:03,060
We'd never good when anybody dies.

1278
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:04,840
It's terrible when American soldiers die,

1279
00:36:04,841 --> 00:36:08,220
but it's also terrible when Iraqi
and Afghanistan civilians die too.

1280
00:36:08,610 --> 00:36:09,210
And you know,

1281
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:10,050
we don't hear too much.

1282
00:36:10,051 --> 00:36:11,100
Talk about that man.

1283
00:36:11,310 --> 00:36:12,030
You don't hear him too much.

1284
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:12,601
Talk about that.

1285
00:36:12,601 --> 00:36:15,050
1 million people have
died in Iraq altogether.

1286
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:16,140
That's a giant number,

1287
00:36:16,141 --> 00:36:16,800
man.

1288
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:17,111
That's a,

1289
00:36:17,111 --> 00:36:18,000
that's a scary,

1290
00:36:18,001 --> 00:36:20,100
crazy mind bending number,

1291
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:21,510
but more no Nazis,

1292
00:36:21,511 --> 00:36:21,721
right?

1293
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:22,590
Wheat and way more.

1294
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:23,520
I don't know.

1295
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,290
Who knows Nazis like 6 million Jews.

1296
00:36:25,291 --> 00:36:27,910
It wasn't any count to
Juke per for one person to,

1297
00:36:27,911 --> 00:36:28,111
oh,

1298
00:36:28,111 --> 00:36:28,640
how dare you,

1299
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:29,210
everybody.

1300
00:36:29,210 --> 00:36:31,470
So I think the Nazis chose to be more,

1301
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,240
I think the Nazis just like 6 million,

1302
00:36:33,330 --> 00:36:33,600
right?

1303
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,120
Wasn't it?

1304
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:34,520
Yeah,

1305
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,400
we disputed whatever,

1306
00:36:35,401 --> 00:36:35,941
whatever it was.

1307
00:36:35,941 --> 00:36:37,020
I think it was more but either.

1308
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:37,531
Either way.

1309
00:36:37,531 --> 00:36:38,191
It's not no one,

1310
00:36:38,191 --> 00:36:39,570
no one saying what's bad or what's worse.

1311
00:36:39,571 --> 00:36:41,460
They're both fucking
horrible and disgusting.

1312
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:42,211
It's just,

1313
00:36:42,211 --> 00:36:42,441
it's,

1314
00:36:42,441 --> 00:36:42,810
it's,

1315
00:36:42,810 --> 00:36:43,320
we don't,

1316
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,640
we don't experience it over here.

1317
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:46,320
And because we don't
experience it over here,

1318
00:36:46,321 --> 00:36:49,200
the only people that truly appreciate
what the fuck is happening in the world

1319
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:50,100
are veterans.

1320
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,960
They're the only ones
who truly appreciate it.

1321
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:52,411
You know?

1322
00:36:52,411 --> 00:36:53,250
And I know a lot of them,

1323
00:36:53,251 --> 00:36:53,461
man.

1324
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:55,110
I know a lot of them because of the UFC.

1325
00:36:55,111 --> 00:36:56,910
I knew a lot of them
because of the Jujitsu.

1326
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,930
I know a lot of dudes
who have been over there.

1327
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,920
I went to high school with a bunch of
dudes who went to the first Gulf War,

1328
00:37:02,310 --> 00:37:02,551
you know,

1329
00:37:02,551 --> 00:37:03,480
and talk to them about it.

1330
00:37:03,481 --> 00:37:04,080
It's a,

1331
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,670
it's a mind bending shit man.

1332
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:06,840
It never the same human being.

1333
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:07,580
My,

1334
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:11,150
my grandfather was a pow and they actually
wrote a book about him and everything

1335
00:37:11,151 --> 00:37:11,990
like that about his,

1336
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,550
a unit because he was at war,

1337
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:14,571
World War Two.

1338
00:37:14,571 --> 00:37:19,571
He was a beat was at B 52 bomber or he
was a gunner on when the bombers and that

1339
00:37:20,721 --> 00:37:24,590
plane fell from the sky and he had to
parachute out and he had like this huge

1340
00:37:24,591 --> 00:37:26,930
piece of metal in his parachute
that he kept on his desk,

1341
00:37:26,931 --> 00:37:27,070
you know,

1342
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:28,460
that he kept somehow,

1343
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:29,181
anyways,

1344
00:37:29,181 --> 00:37:31,970
he was a prisoner of war and
my full family thought he was,

1345
00:37:31,990 --> 00:37:32,510
they were,

1346
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:33,200
he was gone,

1347
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:33,501
you know,

1348
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:35,270
and then you finally got
released and stuff like that.

1349
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:36,433
And uh,

1350
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,490
how long was he in jail for?

1351
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:38,181
Or He,

1352
00:37:38,181 --> 00:37:41,120
I think it was six to eight
months or something like that.

1353
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:41,983
I forget.

1354
00:37:42,050 --> 00:37:42,351
But,

1355
00:37:42,351 --> 00:37:42,680
uh,

1356
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:43,820
they like tortured on,

1357
00:37:43,821 --> 00:37:45,440
they did everything to them and stuff.

1358
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:49,910
And I remember right
before he died was when um,

1359
00:37:49,970 --> 00:37:53,600
call of duty one came out
or two came out and uh,

1360
00:37:53,601 --> 00:37:57,290
I was playing it and he came over and I
remember him sitting down there and just

1361
00:37:57,350 --> 00:37:58,370
like freak,

1362
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,620
like his eyes were just staring at the TV.

1363
00:38:00,621 --> 00:38:01,221
Like he couldn't,

1364
00:38:01,221 --> 00:38:01,641
well one,

1365
00:38:01,641 --> 00:38:02,540
cause it was a video game.

1366
00:38:02,541 --> 00:38:02,781
Predator.

1367
00:38:02,781 --> 00:38:03,680
I saw a video game before,

1368
00:38:03,681 --> 00:38:04,011
but two,

1369
00:38:04,011 --> 00:38:07,210
it was just like you could tell
it kind of put them back in there.

1370
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:08,360
It was kind of creepy man.

1371
00:38:08,361 --> 00:38:10,320
I had to turn it off because
it was freaking me out.

1372
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:11,640
Fuck yeah it would,

1373
00:38:11,641 --> 00:38:12,780
holy Shit.

1374
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:13,681
Wow.

1375
00:38:13,681 --> 00:38:16,230
He was a prisoner of war in Japan.

1376
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:18,850
Is that where it was or
wasn't returning to Germany?

1377
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:20,980
You don't get why fly?

1378
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:22,023
I just thought,

1379
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:23,191
you know what I'm saying,

1380
00:38:23,191 --> 00:38:24,024
suck my Dick.

1381
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,390
You fucking don't get Wifi.

1382
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:29,090
You have a nervous breakdown.

1383
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:29,730
You know what I'm saying?

1384
00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:30,563
Yeah.

1385
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:31,800
That's what I'm talking about.

1386
00:38:31,801 --> 00:38:32,520
We've,

1387
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,980
that's why we allow all this shit
to happen in other countries.

1388
00:38:35,170 --> 00:38:36,010
We allow it because we

1389
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:36,430
don't,

1390
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:38,500
we don't experience it here
so we don't understand it.

1391
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:40,870
And the only people that do experience
it are veterans and they were already

1392
00:38:40,871 --> 00:38:41,261
over there.

1393
00:38:41,261 --> 00:38:41,950
It's too late.

1394
00:38:41,950 --> 00:38:43,090
By the time they experience it,

1395
00:38:43,091 --> 00:38:43,924
it's too late.

1396
00:38:44,050 --> 00:38:44,470
You know,

1397
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:45,010
they can't,

1398
00:38:45,010 --> 00:38:45,191
I mean,

1399
00:38:45,191 --> 00:38:48,580
whether the change the way that
non-experienced understand war.

1400
00:38:48,610 --> 00:38:48,761
No,

1401
00:38:48,761 --> 00:38:49,510
there's no way.

1402
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:50,640
The only way to understand wars,

1403
00:38:50,650 --> 00:38:51,483
you'd have to be in it.

1404
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:53,020
And if you were in it then
everybody would be like,

1405
00:38:53,021 --> 00:38:54,040
let's stop this.

1406
00:38:54,041 --> 00:38:55,300
What the fuck are we doing?

1407
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:56,111
You know,

1408
00:38:56,111 --> 00:38:57,550
there's a Jake shields,

1409
00:38:57,551 --> 00:38:58,570
a head trainer,

1410
00:38:58,690 --> 00:38:59,230
uh,

1411
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:02,410
I forgot his name to rock
something truck Aziz.

1412
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:04,480
He's a over in Afghanistan right now.

1413
00:39:04,481 --> 00:39:05,020
And he saw it.

1414
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:07,230
He was tweeting about it and
he was tweeting about how uh,

1415
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:08,470
there's like there,

1416
00:39:08,471 --> 00:39:12,280
no one's talking about these NATO's
tracks that are killing all the civilians.

1417
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:15,070
And there was parts of
some woman stuck to a tree.

1418
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,230
Like he was walking near this,

1419
00:39:17,231 --> 00:39:17,651
this site.

1420
00:39:17,651 --> 00:39:19,690
And there's parts of a
woman's stuck to a tree.

1421
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:20,553
Just some,

1422
00:39:20,610 --> 00:39:21,310
yeah,

1423
00:39:21,310 --> 00:39:22,210
just some poor,

1424
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:24,190
innocent person in the wrong place.

1425
00:39:24,191 --> 00:39:25,030
When the missiles come,

1426
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:26,260
you know,

1427
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:28,110
how do you know it was a woman
was just like better on the gym.

1428
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:28,953
And he didn't,

1429
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:29,950
he didn't specify,

1430
00:39:29,951 --> 00:39:30,790
but I guess he knew,

1431
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:31,300
you know,

1432
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:32,190
I got me to seeing it.

1433
00:39:32,191 --> 00:39:34,760
It's something like that to Joe Rogan.

1434
00:39:34,761 --> 00:39:36,200
So she imagined this is,

1435
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:39,970
this is the scene yesterday I'm
watching because it's piece,

1436
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:40,521
I watch her,

1437
00:39:40,521 --> 00:39:41,800
she was very fucking funny.

1438
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:44,620
It's the part with a
dude from the Godfather,

1439
00:39:44,621 --> 00:39:45,910
strong cards in the body.

1440
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:47,201
I don't remember that.

1441
00:39:47,201 --> 00:39:48,430
Robert Duval is all

1442
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,530
cards on the bodies,

1443
00:39:49,531 --> 00:39:49,920
you know,

1444
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:50,261
asis,

1445
00:39:50,261 --> 00:39:51,094
spades.

1446
00:39:51,270 --> 00:39:53,760
And all of a sudden he
does just death everywhere.

1447
00:39:54,150 --> 00:39:55,620
And all of a sudden they
come to him and they go,

1448
00:39:55,621 --> 00:39:55,801
Hey,

1449
00:39:55,801 --> 00:39:56,700
this guy is here.

1450
00:39:57,030 --> 00:39:57,900
He wants to talk to you.

1451
00:39:57,901 --> 00:39:58,201
And it's,

1452
00:39:58,201 --> 00:39:58,740
uh,

1453
00:39:58,740 --> 00:39:59,041
you know,

1454
00:39:59,041 --> 00:39:59,491
winnings.

1455
00:39:59,491 --> 00:40:01,720
Father Charlie [inaudible],

1456
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:03,360
who was brilliant is awesome.

1457
00:40:03,361 --> 00:40:04,170
He comes over and,

1458
00:40:04,170 --> 00:40:05,003
excuse me sir,

1459
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:08,550
he comes over with the fucking thing.

1460
00:40:08,551 --> 00:40:09,061
Excuse me,

1461
00:40:09,061 --> 00:40:09,780
sir,

1462
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:10,380
Major,

1463
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:10,941
whatever that,

1464
00:40:10,941 --> 00:40:11,041
that,

1465
00:40:11,041 --> 00:40:11,150
that,

1466
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:12,810
that the tie and Robert do vowels.

1467
00:40:12,811 --> 00:40:14,880
Got a little thing on him without a shirt.

1468
00:40:14,881 --> 00:40:17,910
I would his fucking hat
on spoken and he's like,

1469
00:40:17,911 --> 00:40:18,151
yeah,

1470
00:40:18,151 --> 00:40:18,391
yeah,

1471
00:40:18,391 --> 00:40:19,050
whatever.

1472
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:20,550
And Lawson in the middle
of the conversation,

1473
00:40:20,551 --> 00:40:21,420
some other guy comes and goes,

1474
00:40:21,421 --> 00:40:22,254
hey sir,

1475
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:23,221
that's lance.

1476
00:40:23,221 --> 00:40:24,210
Whatever Johnson,

1477
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:27,210
the famous surfer in the
middle of conversation,

1478
00:40:27,211 --> 00:40:29,070
he just walks away from weddings.

1479
00:40:29,071 --> 00:40:30,350
Father walks up and goes,

1480
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:31,141
excuse me.

1481
00:40:31,141 --> 00:40:32,730
So both the black kid,

1482
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:35,790
the break black kid that's now in on CSI.

1483
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:36,360
Yeah,

1484
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,410
they both goals sir.

1485
00:40:37,590 --> 00:40:38,520
And the lesson that the guy goes,

1486
00:40:38,521 --> 00:40:42,870
let's Justin is going to last and Laurence
Fishburne cause [inaudible] he goes,

1487
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,130
[inaudible] Jasmine the surfing.

1488
00:40:44,131 --> 00:40:44,341
He goes,

1489
00:40:44,341 --> 00:40:44,461
yeah.

1490
00:40:44,461 --> 00:40:47,240
He goes and he looks at fucking
Charlie Sheen's following Leo.

1491
00:40:47,270 --> 00:40:47,820
He goes,

1492
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:48,653
they will you.

1493
00:40:48,930 --> 00:40:50,280
That's a classic line.

1494
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,180
He didn't give a fuck.

1495
00:40:51,181 --> 00:40:52,260
This guy was a major,

1496
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,150
this guy was a surfer and he goes,

1497
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,980
they would do that is,

1498
00:40:56,010 --> 00:40:56,781
I never caught that.

1499
00:40:56,781 --> 00:40:58,420
I've seen the movie 18 fucking times.

1500
00:40:58,421 --> 00:41:02,790
I never seen that when a crazy movie where
he's he fucking one movie ticket like

1501
00:41:02,791 --> 00:41:03,750
six years to make.

1502
00:41:03,810 --> 00:41:04,141
Listen,

1503
00:41:04,141 --> 00:41:06,060
they had on the crazy one,

1504
00:41:06,061 --> 00:41:10,950
the one that got redux on AMC
would no commercial and came home.

1505
00:41:10,951 --> 00:41:15,240
I bumped into flip Schultz and he gave
me two fucking candies that put me in

1506
00:41:15,241 --> 00:41:15,681
Jupiter,

1507
00:41:15,681 --> 00:41:16,140
had it.

1508
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,700
I had to come home and
make a pot of coffee.

1509
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:21,570
So I'm watching that last scene when
he's creeping in there shooting at the

1510
00:41:21,571 --> 00:41:22,351
Chinese and he goes,

1511
00:41:22,351 --> 00:41:23,310
he's up on a hill,

1512
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:24,390
and he goes,

1513
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:24,691
he goes,

1514
00:41:24,691 --> 00:41:25,280
who's your,

1515
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:25,500
uh,

1516
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:26,321
whatever officer.

1517
00:41:26,321 --> 00:41:27,020
He goes,

1518
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:29,610
isn't it you the black guy?

1519
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:30,930
I thought it was human,

1520
00:41:30,931 --> 00:41:31,764
but that guy's funny.

1521
00:41:32,130 --> 00:41:35,390
That guys are stoked when he keeps
walking is a guy that he goes,

1522
00:41:35,391 --> 00:41:36,950
you got the mortars and the brothers,

1523
00:41:36,970 --> 00:41:38,630
real yoked member.

1524
00:41:38,631 --> 00:41:39,464
This Joyce,

1525
00:41:39,810 --> 00:41:40,880
he takes his time.

1526
00:41:40,881 --> 00:41:42,020
He looks at Pomona fucker.

1527
00:41:42,350 --> 00:41:46,190
He's got those black eyes from Memphis
with the veins and I'm fucked up.

1528
00:41:46,490 --> 00:41:49,670
You can hit Jimmy Hendrix in the
back and it tastes not his thing,

1529
00:41:49,671 --> 00:41:52,490
and he puts a mortar in it
and with them looking at him,

1530
00:41:52,491 --> 00:41:53,324
he just goes,

1531
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:58,040
and you see a bad and awesome the G,

1532
00:41:58,041 --> 00:42:00,950
they're yelling stops
and he just looks at him.

1533
00:42:00,951 --> 00:42:02,480
He don't say a fucking word.

1534
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:03,990
Okay?

1535
00:42:03,990 --> 00:42:04,621
He goes,

1536
00:42:04,621 --> 00:42:05,401
the guy in the morning,

1537
00:42:05,401 --> 00:42:06,234
she goes,

1538
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:07,770
do you know who the commanding officer?

1539
00:42:07,771 --> 00:42:08,970
And the Black Guy goes?

1540
00:42:10,330 --> 00:42:11,350
He just walks away.

1541
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,170
He don't even give mine
and seen an answer.

1542
00:42:14,171 --> 00:42:15,160
He just walks away.

1543
00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:17,390
I don't remember this is
this when a it this way.

1544
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,710
He's on finding Kurtz.

1545
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,310
The way the the,

1546
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:23,410
and this is the last stop
before Kurtz cursing.

1547
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:26,000
This is the last stop
before he gets up there.

1548
00:42:26,001 --> 00:42:27,760
Marlon Brando's too fucking fat.

1549
00:42:28,030 --> 00:42:28,990
He supposed to show up.

1550
00:42:29,350 --> 00:42:30,310
If you know the story,

1551
00:42:30,311 --> 00:42:34,600
he supposed to show up at training camp
to 40 he shows up at three 20 it says,

1552
00:42:34,601 --> 00:42:34,691
well,

1553
00:42:34,691 --> 00:42:35,710
what are Marlon Brando?

1554
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:36,851
Well,

1555
00:42:36,851 --> 00:42:37,301
I feel like,

1556
00:42:37,301 --> 00:42:38,290
so what are we going to do?

1557
00:42:38,350 --> 00:42:39,790
You're supposed to be an ex soldier.

1558
00:42:39,791 --> 00:42:40,710
What are you supposed to do?

1559
00:42:40,711 --> 00:42:41,950
He was just fucking black.

1560
00:42:41,951 --> 00:42:46,690
My fucking stomach cover put black
on me and just showing my face.

1561
00:42:46,990 --> 00:42:47,410
That's why.

1562
00:42:47,410 --> 00:42:49,270
And all this seems all
you see is his face.

1563
00:42:49,271 --> 00:42:50,230
You don't see his body.

1564
00:42:50,590 --> 00:42:52,240
You see him rubbing his fat head and shit,

1565
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:53,410
but they don't show you his body.

1566
00:42:53,450 --> 00:42:53,601
Yeah.

1567
00:42:53,601 --> 00:42:54,820
That is one of the weirdest,

1568
00:42:54,821 --> 00:42:57,760
most singular performance has ever insane.

1569
00:42:57,790 --> 00:43:00,340
And the guy nagging him
the whole time and his ear,

1570
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,410
you're getting tortured.

1571
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:02,360
Who's the guy with the fall?

1572
00:43:02,410 --> 00:43:04,210
But the man is a genius,

1573
00:43:04,211 --> 00:43:05,470
but his soul is mad.

1574
00:43:05,710 --> 00:43:06,940
What's that crazy hippie?

1575
00:43:07,030 --> 00:43:07,700
I don't know.

1576
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:07,960
You know,

1577
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:09,190
he wanted to kill me yesterday,

1578
00:43:09,191 --> 00:43:09,491
dude.

1579
00:43:09,491 --> 00:43:10,241
He wanted to kill me,

1580
00:43:10,241 --> 00:43:11,500
but he's powerful.

1581
00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:11,801
He,

1582
00:43:11,801 --> 00:43:11,981
you know,

1583
00:43:11,981 --> 00:43:13,510
he was just kept bad hippie talk.

1584
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:13,901
It's,

1585
00:43:13,901 --> 00:43:15,060
it's just an amazing,

1586
00:43:15,070 --> 00:43:18,330
at the end they killed a bull at
the same time when they kill him,

1587
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:21,130
Marlon Brando and you hear
the end with the doors,

1588
00:43:21,131 --> 00:43:22,160
they just do it perfect.

1589
00:43:22,161 --> 00:43:24,250
And then doing the dance
and the Vietnamese,

1590
00:43:24,251 --> 00:43:26,910
whatever the fuck they are
killing chickens and they kill it.

1591
00:43:26,930 --> 00:43:27,763
It just,

1592
00:43:27,970 --> 00:43:28,840
it's brilliant.

1593
00:43:28,990 --> 00:43:30,010
Fucking brilliant movie.

1594
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:31,450
I forgot all about the fucking phone.

1595
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:34,180
So what Happy Memorial Day is what
I'm trying to fucking say to you.

1596
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:35,380
That's one of those movies.

1597
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:38,050
That's one of those movies
that every time you watch it,

1598
00:43:38,051 --> 00:43:40,210
if you haven't seen it a couple of
years to just shake your head and go,

1599
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:41,110
God damn.

1600
00:43:41,111 --> 00:43:42,580
They did trick him with acid.

1601
00:43:42,670 --> 00:43:44,350
They did give him mass in the movie.

1602
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:44,620
Who?

1603
00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:45,340
Marlon Brando.

1604
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:45,971
Martin Sheen.

1605
00:43:45,971 --> 00:43:50,971
So think about a day Martin Sheen gave
Marlin Brando director gave Martin sheen

1606
00:43:51,041 --> 00:43:52,300
acid and he really,

1607
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:52,780
and he did.

1608
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:56,080
So that scene when he's in the bedroom
and he's smashing the window with karate

1609
00:43:56,081 --> 00:43:57,060
and he was at,

1610
00:43:58,030 --> 00:43:58,750
he was on acid.

1611
00:43:58,750 --> 00:43:59,610
They just tricked him.

1612
00:43:59,620 --> 00:44:00,453
They just said,

1613
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:02,920
because he talks about it and
go and then it's off the lazy.

1614
00:44:03,010 --> 00:44:03,760
They were gone.

1615
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:04,770
They was the Philippines.

1616
00:44:04,771 --> 00:44:05,640
It's very rude.

1617
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:09,250
Didn't shoot that movie in that
way on some fucking went to vista.

1618
00:44:09,251 --> 00:44:10,084
You know what I'm saying?

1619
00:44:10,150 --> 00:44:11,620
They didn't shoot that on location.

1620
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:16,690
They'd cook that Martin whatever
launch he was 16 and took him to the

1621
00:44:16,691 --> 00:44:17,231
Philippines.

1622
00:44:17,231 --> 00:44:18,870
His parents had a fucking dog.

1623
00:44:21,090 --> 00:44:21,923
Shit.

1624
00:44:22,670 --> 00:44:23,150
Meanwhile,

1625
00:44:23,150 --> 00:44:26,980
that that accurately represents the age
of some soldiers mean it's not 16 it's

1626
00:44:26,981 --> 00:44:30,220
18 but how much difference is
16 to 18 what's the difference?

1627
00:44:30,221 --> 00:44:32,220
16 and 18 are in fucking right there,

1628
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:32,720
man.

1629
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:34,020
Just a few months.

1630
00:44:34,050 --> 00:44:34,231
You know,

1631
00:44:34,231 --> 00:44:35,160
what is it 30 months?

1632
00:44:35,161 --> 00:44:38,130
20 it's supposed to be 24 but what is
it like the woods to under and once the

1633
00:44:38,131 --> 00:44:38,580
over,

1634
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:39,930
you know what's the
lowest amount of months?

1635
00:44:39,931 --> 00:44:42,660
It can be 1314 months difference.

1636
00:44:42,661 --> 00:44:43,090
Boom.

1637
00:44:43,090 --> 00:44:45,360
All of a sudden you're in
a fucking kid outta here,

1638
00:44:45,361 --> 00:44:45,960
man.

1639
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:49,830
You're in the army at 18
eight bullets flying at that,

1640
00:44:49,831 --> 00:44:52,830
just the army camp Pendleton
doing push ups with your buddies.

1641
00:44:52,910 --> 00:44:53,281
Cheese.

1642
00:44:53,281 --> 00:44:53,761
I was talking,

1643
00:44:53,761 --> 00:44:56,640
they'd take you and they take it to
the fucking jungles of over there.

1644
00:44:57,020 --> 00:45:00,390
I mean just 18 dog and
you've seen death every day.

1645
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:02,220
You can't even imagine that life.

1646
00:45:02,250 --> 00:45:02,970
My gone.

1647
00:45:02,970 --> 00:45:05,100
Every time you've got
tight with somebody's boom,

1648
00:45:05,101 --> 00:45:06,660
he gets it and they just don't get shot.

1649
00:45:06,750 --> 00:45:07,390
You can,

1650
00:45:07,390 --> 00:45:12,090
can you how old you have to be to go to
war is at 18 I think so 18 you can sign

1651
00:45:12,091 --> 00:45:13,980
up before that though and like wait.

1652
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:14,220
Right.

1653
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:17,160
Or your parents could take it and I
go look at my son's fucking retarded.

1654
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:18,091
You don't want,

1655
00:45:18,091 --> 00:45:19,260
he don't give a fuck about to track.

1656
00:45:19,290 --> 00:45:22,100
Say you don't give a fuck
sick or he wore that.

1657
00:45:22,210 --> 00:45:23,790
All he wants to do is shoot people.

1658
00:45:23,850 --> 00:45:26,760
Isn't it funny though that when you
talk about like the 16 to 18 thing,

1659
00:45:26,761 --> 00:45:30,180
it's funny that we have like an age
when we decide you're ready for shit.

1660
00:45:30,690 --> 00:45:31,081
You know,

1661
00:45:31,081 --> 00:45:34,440
I mean it's important but like there's
an age like in some countries or in some

1662
00:45:34,441 --> 00:45:35,040
parts of the,

1663
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:35,791
even this country,

1664
00:45:35,791 --> 00:45:37,960
they'll let you marry
when you're 16 and like,

1665
00:45:37,961 --> 00:45:40,140
cause you can fuck and
Mary when you're 16.

1666
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:40,330
Yeah,

1667
00:45:40,330 --> 00:45:43,170
it should be against the law that you
shouldn't even be allowed to have have

1668
00:45:43,171 --> 00:45:44,610
babies before 21.

1669
00:45:44,650 --> 00:45:48,030
Well you know that that teacher
that got busted up in Seattle,

1670
00:45:48,031 --> 00:45:48,721
the Seattle,

1671
00:45:48,721 --> 00:45:49,441
Washington area,

1672
00:45:49,441 --> 00:45:50,221
he was banging his,

1673
00:45:50,221 --> 00:45:50,461
uh,

1674
00:45:50,461 --> 00:45:51,294
his student,

1675
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:52,171
he was a,

1676
00:45:52,171 --> 00:45:52,860
um,

1677
00:45:52,860 --> 00:45:53,311
I think it was like,

1678
00:45:53,311 --> 00:45:53,520
uh,

1679
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:56,610
he was like a fifth grade teacher or
something like that and he was like Super

1680
00:45:56,610 --> 00:45:56,610
Christian.

1681
00:45:56,610 --> 00:45:58,720
It was really creepy cause
you go to his website,

1682
00:45:58,750 --> 00:45:59,440
he's like all like,

1683
00:45:59,440 --> 00:45:59,630
Ooh,

1684
00:45:59,630 --> 00:46:00,750
this is how we stop bullies.

1685
00:46:00,970 --> 00:46:05,970
Meanwhile he's banging some 15 year old
and he apparently they got together and

1686
00:46:06,090 --> 00:46:08,190
made out a few times when she was 15.

1687
00:46:08,191 --> 00:46:11,850
But she says they didn't have a
sexual relationship until she was 16,

1688
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,180
which is technically illegal
in the state of Washington.

1689
00:46:15,181 --> 00:46:17,550
But they're going after him
anyway because he was a teacher.

1690
00:46:17,551 --> 00:46:18,690
And because it's creepy.

1691
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:20,280
It's creepy.

1692
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:22,950
It's creepy as well.

1693
00:46:22,951 --> 00:46:23,790
Listen man,

1694
00:46:23,850 --> 00:46:25,830
they can go after you
for things being creepy.

1695
00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:26,461
I mean it,

1696
00:46:26,461 --> 00:46:27,690
you don't want to think so,

1697
00:46:27,691 --> 00:46:28,524
but look,

1698
00:46:28,970 --> 00:46:29,490
there's the,

1699
00:46:29,490 --> 00:46:31,530
like they have obscenity laws.

1700
00:46:31,650 --> 00:46:34,310
There's still obscenity laws on the books
and certain parts of the country where

1701
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:35,790
luckily that Max hardcore guy,

1702
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:37,380
that guy's a porno star,

1703
00:46:37,381 --> 00:46:38,340
it made disgusting.

1704
00:46:38,341 --> 00:46:38,970
Porns.

1705
00:46:38,970 --> 00:46:41,370
And so that guy's in a jail
somewhere because of that.

1706
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:43,050
Have you heard about this thing,

1707
00:46:43,051 --> 00:46:43,770
Joey?

1708
00:46:43,770 --> 00:46:44,603
Go take a leak.

1709
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:45,240
The uh,

1710
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:50,240
Supreme Court decided to change the
fourth amendment over marijuana smell the

1711
00:46:51,631 --> 00:46:52,620
supreme court.

1712
00:46:52,710 --> 00:46:54,210
This is a crazy story.

1713
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:56,220
And Kentucky versus King,

1714
00:46:56,221 --> 00:47:00,540
the U s supreme court has ruled that
cops who smell marijuana coming from your

1715
00:47:00,541 --> 00:47:05,541
home can break down your door and arrest
you as long as they knock first and

1716
00:47:06,181 --> 00:47:10,710
claim to have heard evidence or
heard you destroying evidence,

1717
00:47:11,550 --> 00:47:12,390
that's all they have to do.

1718
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:12,930
Wow.

1719
00:47:12,930 --> 00:47:14,640
And it isn't only in what state?

1720
00:47:15,060 --> 00:47:15,391
Well,

1721
00:47:15,391 --> 00:47:17,820
this is the supreme
court sets a precedent.

1722
00:47:17,821 --> 00:47:19,950
I mean all the marijuana laws or federal,

1723
00:47:20,190 --> 00:47:20,581
the real,

1724
00:47:20,581 --> 00:47:21,001
I mean there's,

1725
00:47:21,001 --> 00:47:23,460
there's state laws but they're
not supposed to be real.

1726
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:24,600
Like in the marijuana,

1727
00:47:24,601 --> 00:47:24,891
like in,

1728
00:47:24,891 --> 00:47:25,960
in the medical marijuana,

1729
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:28,980
California met California says
we allow medical marijuana,

1730
00:47:28,990 --> 00:47:32,530
it's passed in 1994 and everyone
says it's legal and Hunky Dory.

1731
00:47:32,710 --> 00:47:34,930
The federal government
can still come in and say,

1732
00:47:34,931 --> 00:47:35,560
no,

1733
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:39,280
federally marijuana is a schedule
one drug and you're all under arrest.

1734
00:47:39,490 --> 00:47:42,100
All you people that are helping out
cancer patients and AIDS patients,

1735
00:47:42,101 --> 00:47:42,790
you're in jail.

1736
00:47:42,790 --> 00:47:44,890
And they did that for a long ass time.

1737
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:46,390
Not only did they do that,

1738
00:47:46,510 --> 00:47:47,680
but when they got arrested,

1739
00:47:47,681 --> 00:47:49,150
this is where it's really fucked up.

1740
00:47:49,330 --> 00:47:53,740
They didn't allow them to use
the expression medical marijuana,

1741
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:57,460
you can't use it because
federally that term doesn't exist.

1742
00:47:57,760 --> 00:47:58,331
So they say,

1743
00:47:58,331 --> 00:47:58,481
well,

1744
00:47:58,481 --> 00:47:59,320
you selling weed,

1745
00:47:59,500 --> 00:47:59,831
you go,

1746
00:47:59,831 --> 00:48:00,311
well yeah,

1747
00:48:00,311 --> 00:48:01,970
but I was selling medical
matter that did the,

1748
00:48:01,971 --> 00:48:02,251
did the,

1749
00:48:02,251 --> 00:48:03,084
did the,

1750
00:48:03,740 --> 00:48:04,970
so you have to say yes,

1751
00:48:04,990 --> 00:48:05,823
I was telling we,

1752
00:48:05,860 --> 00:48:07,090
you can't say no.

1753
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:09,160
They're not going to ask
you if it's cancer patients,

1754
00:48:09,161 --> 00:48:10,750
they're not going to ask
you if it's aids patients.

1755
00:48:10,930 --> 00:48:11,890
They don't give a fuck.

1756
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:15,820
What they're going to say is they're
gonna allow you to only say what they want

1757
00:48:15,821 --> 00:48:17,560
you to say that will incriminate you.

1758
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:22,240
They're not gonna allow you to even use
the expression medical marijuana so that

1759
00:48:22,270 --> 00:48:24,640
that federally shows how they operate.

1760
00:48:24,641 --> 00:48:26,560
But now this new new,

1761
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:29,770
the fourth amendment of the constitution
is that the right of the people to be

1762
00:48:29,771 --> 00:48:31,780
secure in their persons houses,

1763
00:48:31,781 --> 00:48:36,550
papers and effects against unreasonable
searches and seizures shall not be

1764
00:48:36,551 --> 00:48:38,950
violated and no warrants shall issue,

1765
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:44,040
but upon probable cause supported by
oath or affirmation and particularly

1766
00:48:44,261 --> 00:48:48,340
describing the place to be searched
and the persons or things to be seized.

1767
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:50,350
So they have to have a notice.

1768
00:48:50,351 --> 00:48:51,070
They have to have,

1769
00:48:51,070 --> 00:48:52,180
they have to go to a judge.

1770
00:48:52,210 --> 00:48:52,631
If it was,

1771
00:48:52,631 --> 00:48:52,931
listen,

1772
00:48:52,931 --> 00:48:53,380
judge,

1773
00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:55,480
this guy has been selling marijuana.

1774
00:48:55,630 --> 00:48:56,770
This guy has guns.

1775
00:48:56,771 --> 00:48:59,200
This guy's a bad guy and this
is what we know about them.

1776
00:48:59,201 --> 00:49:00,010
There's these,

1777
00:49:00,010 --> 00:49:01,720
this is the people that
have snitched on him.

1778
00:49:01,721 --> 00:49:04,270
This is the photographs we
have of his fucking grow up.

1779
00:49:04,570 --> 00:49:04,781
You know,

1780
00:49:04,781 --> 00:49:05,470
we need a warrant.

1781
00:49:05,470 --> 00:49:05,771
Okay,

1782
00:49:05,771 --> 00:49:06,470
you got a warrant.

1783
00:49:06,470 --> 00:49:09,950
And the judge reviews it to make
sure that the cops aren't Joey,

1784
00:49:09,951 --> 00:49:10,750
what are you doing?

1785
00:49:10,750 --> 00:49:11,520
I can't figure it.

1786
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:13,180
It's just keep going
with it the other way.

1787
00:49:13,330 --> 00:49:14,163
The other way.

1788
00:49:14,350 --> 00:49:14,860
There you go.

1789
00:49:14,860 --> 00:49:15,370
There you go.

1790
00:49:15,370 --> 00:49:16,900
Lift it up like a Rubik's cube.

1791
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:17,793
Oh my God.

1792
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:19,660
How can you not figure this out?

1793
00:49:19,661 --> 00:49:20,494
You're driving me crazy.

1794
00:49:20,740 --> 00:49:22,740
Well that doubt there cope bank guy.

1795
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:23,260
So,

1796
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:23,770
so now,

1797
00:49:23,770 --> 00:49:26,320
so now you don't have to go
through all that whole process.

1798
00:49:26,350 --> 00:49:27,400
Probably don't have to go through that.

1799
00:49:27,401 --> 00:49:27,880
All the,

1800
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:31,690
all the cop has to do is
knock on your door and say,

1801
00:49:32,410 --> 00:49:34,480
I think that you're smoking weed in there.

1802
00:49:34,570 --> 00:49:35,470
Let me in.

1803
00:49:35,620 --> 00:49:38,740
And then if they hear
you destroying evidence,

1804
00:49:38,770 --> 00:49:39,250
which is,

1805
00:49:39,250 --> 00:49:42,480
it could be a toilet flush going,

1806
00:49:42,490 --> 00:49:42,941
holy shit.

1807
00:49:42,941 --> 00:49:44,610
The cops are here are destroying evidence.

1808
00:49:44,850 --> 00:49:47,760
I think whatever noise that they're
going to decipher might be you,

1809
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:49,630
but it's up to them to decide.

1810
00:49:49,631 --> 00:49:50,540
And then they kicked down

1811
00:49:52,150 --> 00:49:54,640
the United States of America
when they kicking their door.

1812
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:57,790
This is Kentucky versus
kings is a u s supreme court.

1813
00:49:58,150 --> 00:49:58,541
This is,

1814
00:49:58,541 --> 00:50:02,860
this is a federal case when they kick in
your door though and they see that you

1815
00:50:02,861 --> 00:50:05,500
have marijuana and you
get like the $80 ticket,

1816
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:07,780
I mean are they allowed to
bust you for anything else?

1817
00:50:07,781 --> 00:50:08,310
They see,

1818
00:50:08,310 --> 00:50:11,560
cause you know how like with $80
ticket is only a state thing.

1819
00:50:11,561 --> 00:50:12,700
It's not a physical thing.

1820
00:50:12,830 --> 00:50:13,540
Right.

1821
00:50:13,540 --> 00:50:15,010
But I'm saying if they,

1822
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:16,960
if they bust on your door,

1823
00:50:16,961 --> 00:50:19,180
can they only arrest you for
weed or you know how like,

1824
00:50:19,181 --> 00:50:21,190
you know how they gonna arrest you for
anything that you got in your fucking

1825
00:50:21,191 --> 00:50:22,660
house once they're in,

1826
00:50:23,410 --> 00:50:23,740
if they,

1827
00:50:23,740 --> 00:50:24,690
if see if they'd get it.

1828
00:50:24,690 --> 00:50:25,060
Let's see.

1829
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:27,200
Let's say if they get a war
and they search your house,

1830
00:50:27,201 --> 00:50:28,430
like if they had a warrant for good,

1831
00:50:28,431 --> 00:50:29,510
they think you're selling cocaine,

1832
00:50:29,590 --> 00:50:29,810
right?

1833
00:50:29,810 --> 00:50:31,520
And they go to your house
and there's five dead bodies,

1834
00:50:31,550 --> 00:50:32,031
there's still,

1835
00:50:32,031 --> 00:50:33,650
they're going to arrest you for murder.

1836
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:34,873
You know,

1837
00:50:34,910 --> 00:50:35,631
this is a,

1838
00:50:35,631 --> 00:50:39,950
this is a scary thing because this is
allows cops just say they smelled pot,

1839
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:41,870
but these were only talking about pot.

1840
00:50:42,140 --> 00:50:45,590
The idea that you are going to break
down someone's fucking house because not

1841
00:50:45,591 --> 00:50:47,330
even you smelled them growing it.

1842
00:50:47,570 --> 00:50:48,950
You smell the smoke,

1843
00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:50,480
you smell them using it,

1844
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:55,160
so you smell them doing something that
they want to do and you have a law where

1845
00:50:55,161 --> 00:50:59,370
you can break down the door if you think
that they're destroying that pod that

1846
00:50:59,380 --> 00:51:00,170
they wanted to smoke.

1847
00:51:00,170 --> 00:51:01,100
You think they're flushing it?

1848
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:03,980
That is so these are the feds
and they come with the house.

1849
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:04,730
Exactly.

1850
00:51:04,730 --> 00:51:05,780
That's what this is all about.

1851
00:51:06,410 --> 00:51:07,790
The feds ain't coming to my house.

1852
00:51:07,791 --> 00:51:08,810
Your House or web band.

1853
00:51:09,830 --> 00:51:10,281
That's what I,

1854
00:51:10,281 --> 00:51:11,690
that's what I was just going to get to.

1855
00:51:11,750 --> 00:51:12,583
It's like,

1856
00:51:13,050 --> 00:51:13,490
I mean,

1857
00:51:13,490 --> 00:51:15,630
just to add to people guys,

1858
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:19,430
it's like a ricoh or Rico fucking
fucks everybody up in the ass.

1859
00:51:19,670 --> 00:51:20,960
I don't talk to Joe Rogan.

1860
00:51:20,990 --> 00:51:22,550
I just see him once a fucking month.

1861
00:51:22,790 --> 00:51:25,610
But if you're going to Joe Rogan and you
give him cash and he brings it to me,

1862
00:51:25,611 --> 00:51:27,440
I'm involved with whatever
Joe Rogan's doing.

1863
00:51:27,860 --> 00:51:28,521
You understand me?

1864
00:51:28,521 --> 00:51:29,720
It's a criminal enterprise.

1865
00:51:29,721 --> 00:51:34,070
So now they added this so you can
nail you in a different fucking man.

1866
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:35,210
It's not going to apply now.

1867
00:51:36,210 --> 00:51:36,440
I mean,

1868
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:40,480
when are they going to bust out my door
and get it or you go get a warrant.

1869
00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:42,170
I just,

1870
00:51:42,170 --> 00:51:43,010
I agree with you.

1871
00:51:43,190 --> 00:51:44,023
I agree with you,

1872
00:51:44,030 --> 00:51:45,680
but it's still retarded in scaring.

1873
00:51:45,700 --> 00:51:45,920
Oh,

1874
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:47,090
I understand the idea.

1875
00:51:47,110 --> 00:51:49,790
I agree that it's probably not
going to come up in our lives,

1876
00:51:49,820 --> 00:51:52,580
but it's going to come up in somebody's
life and the only reason why it exists

1877
00:51:52,581 --> 00:51:57,581
at all is because is these a bunch of
clueless old fucks that are in charge of

1878
00:51:57,951 --> 00:51:58,420
running shit

1879
00:51:58,420 --> 00:51:59,253
this country?

1880
00:51:59,260 --> 00:51:59,381
Well,

1881
00:51:59,381 --> 00:52:00,490
this isn't always going to happen.

1882
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:01,410
If they went by sending your door,

1883
00:52:01,430 --> 00:52:03,490
they'll find a thousand of
their ways to get in the door.

1884
00:52:03,690 --> 00:52:04,270
Yeah,

1885
00:52:04,270 --> 00:52:05,020
it's true.

1886
00:52:05,020 --> 00:52:05,411
You know,

1887
00:52:05,411 --> 00:52:05,621
but,

1888
00:52:05,621 --> 00:52:06,281
but you know,

1889
00:52:06,281 --> 00:52:07,180
they don't need help.

1890
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:08,073
They don't need this now.

1891
00:52:08,260 --> 00:52:11,500
They don't need to help buy the fucking
federal government nine 11 I was going

1892
00:52:11,501 --> 00:52:12,940
to change our life forever.

1893
00:52:13,150 --> 00:52:15,340
It wasn't an AED type deal,

1894
00:52:15,341 --> 00:52:18,580
but it changed our life and our liberties.

1895
00:52:18,820 --> 00:52:22,210
A lot of our liberties chains and it
goes back to the 11 I don't know how this

1896
00:52:22,211 --> 00:52:23,044
goes back to it,

1897
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:25,480
but this is just one of the
steps that they're taking.

1898
00:52:25,820 --> 00:52:26,031
Yeah,

1899
00:52:26,031 --> 00:52:27,080
but it's the Joey.

1900
00:52:27,081 --> 00:52:28,250
You can say that all you want,

1901
00:52:28,251 --> 00:52:28,861
but when you're there,

1902
00:52:28,861 --> 00:52:32,500
the law is specifically
about smelling marijuana.

1903
00:52:32,740 --> 00:52:33,241
It's hot.

1904
00:52:33,241 --> 00:52:33,891
It's not.

1905
00:52:33,891 --> 00:52:35,960
That's not protecting
anybody from anything,

1906
00:52:35,961 --> 00:52:36,440
man.

1907
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:37,520
This is nonsense.

1908
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:39,080
This is just nonsense.

1909
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:43,400
That by people that bought into propaganda
and have shown through the decisions,

1910
00:52:43,580 --> 00:52:44,870
if you showed that this is the way you,

1911
00:52:44,871 --> 00:52:45,380
you,

1912
00:52:45,380 --> 00:52:49,040
you think after you've really
experienced and look at all the evidence,

1913
00:52:49,310 --> 00:52:51,980
all that tells me is
you're grossly incompetent.

1914
00:52:52,190 --> 00:52:53,630
Not just grossly incompetent,

1915
00:52:53,631 --> 00:52:55,250
but criminally incompetent.

1916
00:52:55,370 --> 00:52:59,660
The idea that you're there to serve and
protect and you would actively seek to

1917
00:52:59,661 --> 00:53:02,630
lock people up in jail for
a plant that's never killed.

1918
00:53:02,631 --> 00:53:05,600
A single fucking human being
on the face of the planet.

1919
00:53:05,870 --> 00:53:07,580
No one's ever owed deed from it ever.

1920
00:53:07,581 --> 00:53:08,220
It can't.

1921
00:53:08,220 --> 00:53:09,230
It can't happen.

1922
00:53:09,470 --> 00:53:13,070
It's one of the most innocuous natural
substances you could possibly wrap your

1923
00:53:13,071 --> 00:53:13,904
fucking head around.

1924
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:19,190
And the fact that these cons have made
a law where if they smell you enjoying

1925
00:53:19,191 --> 00:53:23,450
this fantastic plant that makes sex better
and food tastes better and makes you

1926
00:53:23,451 --> 00:53:24,830
more creative and they smell it,

1927
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:25,890
they can kick down your

1928
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:28,260
fucking door and lock you in a cage.

1929
00:53:28,350 --> 00:53:31,320
This is some draconian or well,

1930
00:53:31,380 --> 00:53:33,990
1984 movie type shit.

1931
00:53:34,020 --> 00:53:35,520
This is ridiculous.

1932
00:53:36,990 --> 00:53:41,990
I fucking go and hit a weed store
with a gun at lunchtime would read,

1933
00:53:42,091 --> 00:53:46,530
man read Ben's real driver is he
the driver gets the gun a thousand.

1934
00:53:46,590 --> 00:53:47,423
They love the story.

1935
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:49,050
They come in front of my house.

1936
00:53:50,170 --> 00:53:51,150
Let's go over there.

1937
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:56,480
Let's go over there and watch whatever
the fuck they got to do now is knock on

1938
00:53:56,790 --> 00:53:57,660
the fucking door,

1939
00:53:58,490 --> 00:53:59,370
knock on the door and say,

1940
00:53:59,371 --> 00:54:00,900
we smoked weed and flying to go,

1941
00:54:00,901 --> 00:54:01,141
whoa.

1942
00:54:01,141 --> 00:54:01,974
Red Bands here.

1943
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:02,881
Let's say you had,

1944
00:54:02,881 --> 00:54:04,400
let's say Joe Rogan has a warrant.

1945
00:54:04,401 --> 00:54:05,820
He comes to my house for dinner.

1946
00:54:06,330 --> 00:54:07,350
This is all this.

1947
00:54:07,351 --> 00:54:09,770
This is just less paperwork
for his cock suckers.

1948
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:12,120
This doesn't even make you
go home and get a warrant.

1949
00:54:12,121 --> 00:54:13,680
So what you're telling
me is that they smell it.

1950
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:17,310
They don't even have to go to the judge
and get signed off on a warrant telling

1951
00:54:17,311 --> 00:54:17,940
me exactly,

1952
00:54:17,940 --> 00:54:19,530
this is all part of something different.

1953
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:21,870
This is all part of the rolling.

1954
00:54:21,990 --> 00:54:22,823
Uh,

1955
00:54:23,370 --> 00:54:24,360
I can understand that.

1956
00:54:24,361 --> 00:54:28,230
If you say you smelled the
gun shot and smell gun powder,

1957
00:54:28,260 --> 00:54:31,920
you know what the best thing about
[inaudible] smell that he showed up at one

1958
00:54:31,921 --> 00:54:32,200
hand,

1959
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:33,200
he showed you the other one.

1960
00:54:33,210 --> 00:54:34,200
It became a depressant.

1961
00:54:34,380 --> 00:54:35,910
The problem that's going
on in this country,

1962
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:36,751
none of you fucking Mo,

1963
00:54:36,751 --> 00:54:37,250
most of you.

1964
00:54:37,250 --> 00:54:41,550
This is a slow mind fuck of communism
from all your little fucking computers and

1965
00:54:41,551 --> 00:54:42,720
you Twitter and your message,

1966
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:44,010
they just taking your fuck.

1967
00:54:44,011 --> 00:54:44,910
This is communism,

1968
00:54:45,330 --> 00:54:45,931
communism,

1969
00:54:45,931 --> 00:54:47,550
that this is all communism.

1970
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:48,480
They got us,

1971
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:53,070
they got us everything we say they got
us now and they're gonna keep getting

1972
00:54:53,071 --> 00:54:54,060
worse and worse.

1973
00:54:54,210 --> 00:54:57,510
They're knocking on your fucking
door for smelling marijuana.

1974
00:54:57,510 --> 00:54:57,811
Really?

1975
00:54:57,811 --> 00:54:58,890
It's 2011.

1976
00:54:58,950 --> 00:54:59,491
It's crazy.

1977
00:54:59,491 --> 00:55:01,050
And Japan is dying over there.

1978
00:55:01,260 --> 00:55:01,801
You know what I'm saying?

1979
00:55:01,801 --> 00:55:02,760
That these countries,

1980
00:55:02,761 --> 00:55:05,070
there's going to be another
earthquake and a few fucking weeks.

1981
00:55:05,250 --> 00:55:05,461
I mean,

1982
00:55:05,461 --> 00:55:06,150
you know,

1983
00:55:06,150 --> 00:55:08,130
but when we're worried
about you will really,

1984
00:55:08,670 --> 00:55:09,150
really,

1985
00:55:09,150 --> 00:55:11,100
so what communism aren't
you talking about?

1986
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:12,660
They take everything on.

1987
00:55:12,661 --> 00:55:14,190
Every computer is a fucking camera.

1988
00:55:14,191 --> 00:55:15,024
People,

1989
00:55:15,150 --> 00:55:16,380
I dunno if you want to call it,

1990
00:55:16,620 --> 00:55:18,030
I don't know if you want
to call it communism,

1991
00:55:18,031 --> 00:55:19,320
but I agree that it's government.

1992
00:55:19,530 --> 00:55:22,830
It's government is getting bigger and
government wants more and more power and

1993
00:55:22,831 --> 00:55:26,010
government wants less and
less responsibility and
they want to be able to get

1994
00:55:26,011 --> 00:55:26,844
away with shit.

1995
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:28,050
Fucking that sample.

1996
00:55:28,051 --> 00:55:28,884
It's hard to,

1997
00:55:28,950 --> 00:55:30,360
it's hard to run all these people,

1998
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:31,140
you know?

1999
00:55:31,140 --> 00:55:32,310
A lot of us are retarded.

2000
00:55:32,370 --> 00:55:33,420
A lot of us are idiots.

2001
00:55:33,421 --> 00:55:34,500
It's tough to keep us in line,

2002
00:55:34,501 --> 00:55:35,580
but I'll tell you what I did here.

2003
00:55:35,850 --> 00:55:37,980
I'll tell you what I did hear from
somebody who works at the airport.

2004
00:55:38,370 --> 00:55:40,230
Then if you show up to La Actual Burbank,

2005
00:55:40,231 --> 00:55:41,190
one of those airports and say,

2006
00:55:41,191 --> 00:55:44,160
I'm going to Mississippi
and I'm taking a week,

2007
00:55:44,161 --> 00:55:45,080
they'll let you bring it out there.

2008
00:55:45,150 --> 00:55:49,970
Why is this is what I heard
now through the town cop,

2009
00:55:51,020 --> 00:55:51,421
that guy,

2010
00:55:51,421 --> 00:55:51,881
first of all,

2011
00:55:51,881 --> 00:55:52,041
I'm,

2012
00:55:52,041 --> 00:55:53,430
I'm every fucking day smoker.

2013
00:55:53,830 --> 00:55:54,661
You hear this from a car,

2014
00:55:54,661 --> 00:55:56,130
from fucking weed stores and shit.

2015
00:55:56,131 --> 00:55:57,630
And I'm telling you have to check.

2016
00:55:57,650 --> 00:55:59,700
You have to check your
license and show him Michelle.

2017
00:55:59,850 --> 00:56:01,830
And what they tell you is
that when you get there,

2018
00:56:01,831 --> 00:56:02,664
you worry about it.

2019
00:56:02,820 --> 00:56:03,810
That's your own problem.

2020
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:05,580
But now you need your medicine.

2021
00:56:06,690 --> 00:56:07,100
Tell him.

2022
00:56:07,100 --> 00:56:09,420
But they're telling me to save your
receipts cause you could put them on your

2023
00:56:09,421 --> 00:56:10,080
taxes.

2024
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:11,040
Do I do that?

2025
00:56:11,070 --> 00:56:11,670
No,

2026
00:56:11,670 --> 00:56:13,230
but this is what's crack
a lack of you guys.

2027
00:56:13,231 --> 00:56:14,100
I'm just fucking talent.

2028
00:56:14,101 --> 00:56:14,820
I wouldn't say,

2029
00:56:14,820 --> 00:56:15,780
I wouldn't claim that.

2030
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:16,270
No,

2031
00:56:16,270 --> 00:56:17,160
no shit.

2032
00:56:18,780 --> 00:56:19,560
No more.

2033
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:22,420
Fuck you to manage the last thing
you want to put your fucking,

2034
00:56:22,810 --> 00:56:24,050
he's receipt for

2035
00:56:24,050 --> 00:56:26,120
$20 a fucking bag of one example.

2036
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:26,590
Yeah.

2037
00:56:26,590 --> 00:56:29,380
What they're saying that people are
claiming on their fucking taxes.

2038
00:56:29,410 --> 00:56:29,651
Yeah.

2039
00:56:29,651 --> 00:56:31,110
Those people are going to use a Jag.

2040
00:56:31,140 --> 00:56:31,261
It's,

2041
00:56:31,261 --> 00:56:32,094
Oh shit.

2042
00:56:32,420 --> 00:56:33,150
Oh Shit.

2043
00:56:33,150 --> 00:56:33,811
What the fuck?

2044
00:56:33,811 --> 00:56:35,650
I think I'm going to show
up with my fucking receipts.

2045
00:56:35,651 --> 00:56:36,370
You all right.

2046
00:56:36,370 --> 00:56:38,430
You fucking retard and get the fuck away

2047
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:41,200
in Burbank.

2048
00:56:41,590 --> 00:56:42,850
You show what will I do it?

2049
00:56:42,980 --> 00:56:43,330
No,

2050
00:56:43,330 --> 00:56:43,780
no,

2051
00:56:43,780 --> 00:56:46,990
but I know people who
will do that and they say,

2052
00:56:46,991 --> 00:56:48,370
worry about it on the other side,

2053
00:56:48,371 --> 00:56:50,950
we will not contact the
other story to danger.

2054
00:56:51,310 --> 00:56:51,791
Danger.

2055
00:56:51,791 --> 00:56:52,271
My friend.

2056
00:56:52,271 --> 00:56:54,980
That's like going to your mother and
telling me you fucking your cousin,

2057
00:56:54,981 --> 00:56:57,460
but don't tell your dad fly bro.

2058
00:56:57,850 --> 00:57:00,180
He takes things across
state lines and shapes.

2059
00:57:01,050 --> 00:57:01,360
Yeah.

2060
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:02,890
Then becomes a federal issue.

2061
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:03,990
It's like when you,

2062
00:57:03,990 --> 00:57:06,340
if you kidnap somebody
and just driving to Vegas,

2063
00:57:06,341 --> 00:57:07,200
you're fuck,

2064
00:57:07,201 --> 00:57:07,421
you know,

2065
00:57:07,421 --> 00:57:08,240
Fab at once.

2066
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:09,073
Not Worth it.

2067
00:57:09,370 --> 00:57:10,203
Let's pretend.

2068
00:57:10,870 --> 00:57:11,980
Let's pretend you don't have a warrant.

2069
00:57:12,690 --> 00:57:13,700
That's even harder there.

2070
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:14,690
That's pretty man.

2071
00:57:14,690 --> 00:57:16,690
I'm glad to be some other
you haven't dealt with.

2072
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:18,550
Let's pretend I'm under suspicion.

2073
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:19,040
Okay?

2074
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:24,040
For a trafficking narcotics and they
don't have a warrant for my arrest,

2075
00:57:25,060 --> 00:57:27,970
but that listening to my
conversations on the phone,

2076
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:29,680
this is how bad this is.

2077
00:57:30,190 --> 00:57:32,470
What is the first thing I say to
you when they answer the phone?

2078
00:57:32,471 --> 00:57:33,370
When you answer the phone,

2079
00:57:33,970 --> 00:57:34,630
Hey,

2080
00:57:34,630 --> 00:57:35,231
can you talk?

2081
00:57:35,231 --> 00:57:36,064
Do you wanna talk?

2082
00:57:36,090 --> 00:57:37,060
What's the first thing I say,

2083
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:37,901
Hey Cox.

2084
00:57:37,901 --> 00:57:39,440
Haycock if you're,

2085
00:57:39,441 --> 00:57:42,630
and if you're in Vegas
and now I'm in La in the,

2086
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:44,140
let's say you have a suspicion,

2087
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:48,150
I get arrested for saying that
over a fucking line was awesome.

2088
00:57:48,190 --> 00:57:49,030
State the state.

2089
00:57:49,031 --> 00:57:49,661
Did you know that?

2090
00:57:49,661 --> 00:57:49,881
Fuck,

2091
00:57:49,881 --> 00:57:50,290
go.

2092
00:57:50,290 --> 00:57:50,951
Wait a minute.

2093
00:57:50,951 --> 00:57:51,784
Wait.

2094
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:56,170
Before you say anything
before you say you're saying,

2095
00:57:56,180 --> 00:57:58,630
if I can't curse and an open line,

2096
00:57:58,780 --> 00:58:00,160
it's a federal law.

2097
00:58:00,250 --> 00:58:01,150
You don't know it.

2098
00:58:01,230 --> 00:58:02,710
It knocked on our rescue.

2099
00:58:03,100 --> 00:58:05,560
But if you're on suspicion for something,

2100
00:58:05,770 --> 00:58:09,200
this is just the way they can
fuck to fuck with you to start.

2101
00:58:09,201 --> 00:58:10,450
Stop you at an airport.

2102
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:10,990
It,

2103
00:58:10,990 --> 00:58:12,040
they have a law for it.

2104
00:58:12,310 --> 00:58:14,920
You can't curse over
an open line and state,

2105
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:16,001
did you know this?

2106
00:58:16,001 --> 00:58:16,301
Okay,

2107
00:58:16,301 --> 00:58:16,610
this is,

2108
00:58:16,610 --> 00:58:17,443
this is,

2109
00:58:17,540 --> 00:58:19,120
that is a fucking genius.

2110
00:58:19,121 --> 00:58:20,080
But nobody knows.

2111
00:58:20,350 --> 00:58:22,030
But these are the stop you liberties.

2112
00:58:22,031 --> 00:58:26,650
This is just to stop you for 15 minutes
and stop you and see if something could

2113
00:58:26,651 --> 00:58:28,860
come up in 24 hours then through a rescue.

2114
00:58:29,070 --> 00:58:31,930
So we use this like if you were swearing,

2115
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:35,800
they could use that as a law to bring you
in and then they start getting you for

2116
00:58:35,801 --> 00:58:36,520
other things.

2117
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:36,910
No,

2118
00:58:36,910 --> 00:58:37,361
listen,

2119
00:58:37,361 --> 00:58:38,260
you fucking nothing.

2120
00:58:38,261 --> 00:58:38,831
What the fuck?

2121
00:58:38,831 --> 00:58:39,510
Joe Rogan,

2122
00:58:39,510 --> 00:58:41,140
nobody ask me a question.

2123
00:58:41,141 --> 00:58:41,291
Okay.

2124
00:58:41,291 --> 00:58:42,220
When you were a detective,

2125
00:58:42,221 --> 00:58:43,500
let's say you're a fan of this technique.

2126
00:58:43,770 --> 00:58:44,890
Let's say you're a felon detective.

2127
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:45,340
Each,

2128
00:58:45,340 --> 00:58:47,170
each state has guidelines and Seattle,

2129
00:58:47,171 --> 00:58:47,950
Washington.

2130
00:58:47,950 --> 00:58:51,160
If I push red man and
Redman has no witnesses,

2131
00:58:51,310 --> 00:58:54,300
they have 72 hours to charge
me with the crime for Redman,

2132
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:55,330
for Bush and red band.

2133
00:58:55,570 --> 00:58:59,860
If they don't get 72 those 72 hours or
a window for them to get you for other

2134
00:58:59,861 --> 00:59:00,520
things,

2135
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:01,780
it's called detainment.

2136
00:59:02,050 --> 00:59:06,310
So when those 12th so let's
pretend Oj stabbed his wife.

2137
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:07,120
All right,

2138
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:09,220
and then have nothing to do with in la,

2139
00:59:09,430 --> 00:59:10,960
but they want to get them for something.

2140
00:59:11,110 --> 00:59:14,970
They'll detain them until
they find something and then
after 24 hours think I'll

2141
00:59:14,980 --> 00:59:15,491
let you go.

2142
00:59:15,491 --> 00:59:17,430
Whatever that state
particularly the law is.

2143
00:59:17,530 --> 00:59:20,860
So you don't have to have knowledge of
the fact that it's on an open line for it

2144
00:59:20,861 --> 00:59:21,470
to,

2145
00:59:21,470 --> 00:59:21,950
yeah,

2146
00:59:21,950 --> 00:59:24,020
and it's a federal wire tap.

2147
00:59:24,050 --> 00:59:25,280
It's a federal wiretap.

2148
00:59:25,490 --> 00:59:26,930
The next time I do the podcast,

2149
00:59:26,931 --> 00:59:28,370
I'll come up here and bring you letters.

2150
00:59:28,371 --> 00:59:30,350
I get bring me some Spotify letters.

2151
00:59:30,620 --> 00:59:31,670
Certify that Shit.

2152
00:59:31,780 --> 00:59:36,110
Get that Shit signed by a Notary Jersey
from New Jersey Federal Prosecutor's

2153
00:59:36,111 --> 00:59:36,381
office.

2154
00:59:36,381 --> 00:59:38,090
I have a friend who is
involved in bookmaking.

2155
00:59:38,420 --> 00:59:39,830
Can we get a wax stamp?

2156
00:59:40,250 --> 00:59:40,671
What do you mean?

2157
00:59:40,671 --> 00:59:44,000
Whenever he calls me know
whenever he called seal.

2158
00:59:44,060 --> 00:59:45,590
Whenever they tapped you on the phone.

2159
00:59:45,591 --> 00:59:46,880
If I have a phone tap,

2160
00:59:46,940 --> 00:59:47,421
it's like crying.

2161
00:59:47,421 --> 00:59:49,610
You don't know when you just
call me because you're my friend.

2162
00:59:49,700 --> 00:59:51,620
Right after they arrested me
and they take me to trial,

2163
00:59:51,621 --> 00:59:54,950
you're going to get a bunch
of mail telling you that
we were listening to you on

2164
00:59:54,951 --> 00:59:55,784
an open line.

2165
00:59:55,880 --> 00:59:56,490
Really?

2166
00:59:56,490 --> 00:59:56,871
Yeah,

2167
00:59:56,871 --> 00:59:57,291
they have.

2168
00:59:57,291 --> 00:59:58,670
These are things they have to do.

2169
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:02,060
See in the old days you knew
if your line was tapped,

2170
01:00:02,061 --> 01:00:03,740
all you had to do was
go to your phone box.

2171
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:04,960
The feds in those days,

2172
01:00:04,961 --> 01:00:08,360
we're putting a tag on your phone that
said property of the United States

2173
01:00:08,361 --> 01:00:09,620
government didn't take a genius.

2174
01:00:09,770 --> 01:00:11,450
They would have to put tags
now that don't have that.

2175
01:00:11,451 --> 01:00:11,961
No more of that.

2176
01:00:11,961 --> 01:00:15,020
And they can tag you or bugs or they
could tag in the box and the tree.

2177
01:00:15,350 --> 01:00:16,161
But in the old days,

2178
01:00:16,161 --> 01:00:17,210
if you lived in an apartment,

2179
01:00:17,211 --> 01:00:18,200
you'll find phone line.

2180
01:00:18,201 --> 01:00:20,130
It was getting tagged or
there was a box in a tree.

2181
01:00:20,131 --> 01:00:21,840
Somewhere we didn't do
was kick the bucket.

2182
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:22,713
Forget.

2183
01:00:22,850 --> 01:00:23,870
Did you ever have your shit?

2184
01:00:24,030 --> 01:00:24,470
Yeah,

2185
01:00:24,470 --> 01:00:25,240
yeah,

2186
01:00:25,240 --> 01:00:25,361
yeah.

2187
01:00:25,361 --> 01:00:25,760
Your water.

2188
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:29,200
And I had friends that had their shit dog.

2189
01:00:29,210 --> 01:00:30,100
I'm not going to sit here and go,

2190
01:00:30,230 --> 01:00:31,160
you hear a click?

2191
01:00:31,220 --> 01:00:32,180
Are you wearing a wire right now?

2192
01:00:32,630 --> 01:00:32,781
Yeah.

2193
01:00:32,781 --> 01:00:32,961
Yeah.

2194
01:00:32,961 --> 01:00:35,660
It's up by Dick sucker.

2195
01:00:36,260 --> 01:00:36,781
Come over here.

2196
01:00:36,781 --> 01:00:37,660
Suck on this phone.

2197
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:38,810
Might get a little dirty.

2198
01:00:38,811 --> 01:00:40,190
It's wire sheriff smile.

2199
01:00:40,340 --> 01:00:41,670
But this is what it is,

2200
01:00:41,671 --> 01:00:43,190
is what do you understand?

2201
01:00:43,191 --> 01:00:43,890
My point is,

2202
01:00:43,890 --> 01:00:45,940
so Joe Rohde,

2203
01:00:45,941 --> 01:00:49,170
what did they a wire tap you
for drugs and 85 and ask him.

2204
01:00:49,171 --> 01:00:50,004
But I would never,

2205
01:00:50,030 --> 01:00:50,863
do you understand me?

2206
01:00:51,110 --> 01:00:55,160
You think of are going to be listening
to our conversation because now they can

2207
01:00:55,161 --> 01:00:56,000
listen to anything.

2208
01:00:56,080 --> 01:00:56,390
Right?

2209
01:00:56,390 --> 01:00:58,200
And so right now I'm at home,

2210
01:00:58,201 --> 01:01:00,600
but for some reason I tap
into red bands and whatever.

2211
01:01:00,610 --> 01:01:04,010
This conversation and I was
in Vegas for the UFC and I go,

2212
01:01:04,370 --> 01:01:04,960
bread bag,

2213
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:05,793
cock sucker.

2214
01:01:06,260 --> 01:01:08,510
They're not going to get a
cop car to come arrest me.

2215
01:01:08,540 --> 01:01:10,770
But so that why you say cock sock?

2216
01:01:10,771 --> 01:01:14,210
And everybody said that he got arrested
and they can't come or whatever.

2217
01:01:14,211 --> 01:01:15,800
And then she got a call
from the cop look up.

2218
01:01:15,801 --> 01:01:17,510
They can't come over to the
rest of it because they're not,

2219
01:01:17,540 --> 01:01:18,950
they're just saying
they're fucking around.

2220
01:01:19,250 --> 01:01:23,060
But let's pretend joggers and under
suspicion for something and they're trying

2221
01:01:23,061 --> 01:01:24,600
to arrest me for some trainer things

2222
01:01:26,100 --> 01:01:26,691
that we know.

2223
01:01:26,691 --> 01:01:28,550
All we need is 24 hours to get them.

2224
01:01:28,730 --> 01:01:30,320
They're wiring me while
they're listening to me.

2225
01:01:30,321 --> 01:01:30,940
They go,

2226
01:01:30,940 --> 01:01:32,360
we're tap that fucking line.

2227
01:01:32,361 --> 01:01:34,190
This is how beautiful
the law works for you.

2228
01:01:34,191 --> 01:01:34,910
Some time,

2229
01:01:34,910 --> 01:01:35,691
tap that line.

2230
01:01:35,691 --> 01:01:37,010
Where is he talking to Vegas?

2231
01:01:37,130 --> 01:01:37,521
Go get,

2232
01:01:37,521 --> 01:01:40,670
go get him for opening over
talking over a fucking,

2233
01:01:40,700 --> 01:01:41,210
uh,

2234
01:01:41,210 --> 01:01:44,030
ultimately they have an open line
wearing over an open level or federal

2235
01:01:44,031 --> 01:01:46,200
boundaries and they'll come
fucking knock on my door.

2236
01:01:46,201 --> 01:01:47,780
And take me down there for 24 hours.

2237
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:49,940
Then released me to say
it was a technicality,

2238
01:01:50,300 --> 01:01:53,930
but at least they took me off the street
for 24 hours and Austin as I'm getting

2239
01:01:53,931 --> 01:01:54,110
up,

2240
01:01:54,110 --> 01:01:54,620
I'll say,

2241
01:01:54,620 --> 01:01:55,191
by the way,

2242
01:01:55,191 --> 01:01:56,030
Mr. Diaz,

2243
01:01:56,300 --> 01:01:58,050
we have another sheet of
paper for your warrant.

2244
01:01:58,280 --> 01:01:58,971
That's what they do.

2245
01:01:58,971 --> 01:02:00,680
That and then they bring it right back.

2246
01:02:00,681 --> 01:02:00,981
Can Be,

2247
01:02:00,981 --> 01:02:04,220
all these rules are going to
be to help a different case.

2248
01:02:04,580 --> 01:02:07,940
A Rico case strengthens the case
when I got in trouble for kidnapping.

2249
01:02:08,270 --> 01:02:11,810
If you get arrested for two or more
violent crimes at the same time,

2250
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:12,591
so let's see,

2251
01:02:12,591 --> 01:02:14,210
you got a shot one and assault to,

2252
01:02:14,510 --> 01:02:17,330
they automatically have to charge
you with crime of violence.

2253
01:02:17,331 --> 01:02:18,230
It's a state law.

2254
01:02:18,650 --> 01:02:20,070
So the assault one,

2255
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:21,270
what's an assault to Swat?

2256
01:02:21,271 --> 01:02:22,950
Why'd you hit him in the
head with a fucking pipe?

2257
01:02:22,951 --> 01:02:24,690
I sought to you shut
the bottle up his ass.

2258
01:02:24,750 --> 01:02:25,583
I'm not sure.

2259
01:02:25,620 --> 01:02:26,890
There's different degrees of,

2260
01:02:26,891 --> 01:02:29,290
you see this guy in
Oklahoma that's getting a,

2261
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:33,420
he's getting first degree murder
because he got robbed and he,

2262
01:02:33,421 --> 01:02:34,081
this is what he did.

2263
01:02:34,081 --> 01:02:35,520
He went outside is a video of it.

2264
01:02:35,700 --> 01:02:36,150
He,

2265
01:02:36,150 --> 01:02:36,451
um,

2266
01:02:36,451 --> 01:02:37,330
they pull out a gun.

2267
01:02:37,360 --> 01:02:37,591
They said,

2268
01:02:37,591 --> 01:02:38,280
give us your money.

2269
01:02:38,280 --> 01:02:41,550
He pulls out his gun and
shoots the fucking guys run.

2270
01:02:41,551 --> 01:02:42,600
There's two guys in the place.

2271
01:02:42,601 --> 01:02:45,810
The first guy he hit with a bullet and
he was a guy who didn't have the gun.

2272
01:02:46,080 --> 01:02:47,010
So the one guy had a gun,

2273
01:02:47,011 --> 01:02:47,700
one guy didn't,

2274
01:02:47,700 --> 01:02:49,140
he shoots the guy who
doesn't have the gun.

2275
01:02:49,170 --> 01:02:50,310
The guy with the gun runs,

2276
01:02:50,460 --> 01:02:53,400
he runs outside with his gun looking
for the guy trying to shoot him.

2277
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:54,300
The guy's gone.

2278
01:02:54,300 --> 01:02:55,350
He comes back inside.

2279
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:57,180
The guy who shot first is on the ground,

2280
01:02:57,450 --> 01:02:58,800
he puts his gun down,

2281
01:02:58,801 --> 01:02:59,790
grabs another gun,

2282
01:03:00,030 --> 01:03:01,830
walks over to the guy and unloads on him.

2283
01:03:01,950 --> 01:03:04,240
Don't do and execute some.

2284
01:03:04,260 --> 01:03:04,870
That's murder.

2285
01:03:04,870 --> 01:03:05,703
That's murder.

2286
01:03:06,750 --> 01:03:07,583
The first time.

2287
01:03:07,830 --> 01:03:09,090
The second time he didn't have them,

2288
01:03:09,130 --> 01:03:11,730
but Texas in Texas,

2289
01:03:11,731 --> 01:03:15,600
they have crimes of passion and now
might be a different motherfucker.

2290
01:03:15,810 --> 01:03:17,550
They might allow you
to get away with that.

2291
01:03:17,551 --> 01:03:18,031
In Texas,

2292
01:03:18,031 --> 01:03:18,160
yeah,

2293
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:19,410
you can pretty much do
whatever you want to you.

2294
01:03:19,411 --> 01:03:21,030
If somebody on your property in Texas,

2295
01:03:21,031 --> 01:03:22,140
you can catch your wife,

2296
01:03:22,141 --> 01:03:25,410
don't bone in some dude and kill the bulk
of them and get away with it and it's

2297
01:03:25,411 --> 01:03:27,080
a crime not to do fashion.

2298
01:03:27,180 --> 01:03:27,421
I mean,

2299
01:03:27,421 --> 01:03:28,280
I'm not saying it's going to happen,

2300
01:03:28,410 --> 01:03:30,030
but the do we seen you could,

2301
01:03:30,060 --> 01:03:30,940
you could argue it.

2302
01:03:30,970 --> 01:03:31,860
The dude in Texas,

2303
01:03:31,861 --> 01:03:34,070
the old dude that had the shotgun
in the house and he was on,

2304
01:03:34,071 --> 01:03:35,520
he called the police
and the police is worse.

2305
01:03:35,840 --> 01:03:36,980
Car Rider will fuck you.

2306
01:03:36,981 --> 01:03:37,730
You are.

2307
01:03:37,730 --> 01:03:39,680
I'm to go shoot these
motherfuckers right now.

2308
01:03:39,700 --> 01:03:40,160
They're like,

2309
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:40,993
come back sir.

2310
01:03:41,250 --> 01:03:41,731
There wasn't that.

2311
01:03:41,731 --> 01:03:43,280
You want us then I come back man.

2312
01:03:43,281 --> 01:03:44,270
But he was an ex cop.

2313
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:45,900
He was like fucking 80 and they're like,

2314
01:03:45,910 --> 01:03:46,550
sir,

2315
01:03:46,550 --> 01:03:47,390
Mine Your Business.

2316
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:48,590
And my dad got,

2317
01:03:48,591 --> 01:03:49,760
damn my my business.

2318
01:03:49,761 --> 01:03:50,690
I'm getting a shotgun,

2319
01:03:50,780 --> 01:03:51,380
sir,

2320
01:03:51,380 --> 01:03:51,830
sir.

2321
01:03:51,830 --> 01:03:52,071
You hear?

2322
01:03:52,071 --> 01:03:53,380
Where was it?

2323
01:03:53,390 --> 01:03:53,990
Houston.

2324
01:03:53,990 --> 01:03:54,561
Boom.

2325
01:03:54,561 --> 01:03:55,131
And he comes back.

2326
01:03:55,131 --> 01:03:55,540
He Goes,

2327
01:03:55,540 --> 01:03:56,600
God damn,

2328
01:03:56,601 --> 01:03:59,240
I got me two motherfuckers
fuckers stay in the house.

2329
01:03:59,241 --> 01:04:00,050
I'm coming right back.

2330
01:04:00,050 --> 01:04:01,490
He went out there in Charlotte again.

2331
01:04:02,460 --> 01:04:03,390
That's right.

2332
01:04:03,460 --> 01:04:05,180
Berglund next dog store.

2333
01:04:05,210 --> 01:04:06,230
Fucking classic.

2334
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:08,233
I'm going to go shoot him.

2335
01:04:08,360 --> 01:04:08,901
No Sir.

2336
01:04:08,901 --> 01:04:10,940
Stay in the house when we were,

2337
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:12,710
we were like working in town that week.

2338
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:13,680
Did it happen?

2339
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:16,870
Then we see where are we in Houston
that weekend when it was happening fast.

2340
01:04:17,300 --> 01:04:18,450
Now it's coming back to me.

2341
01:04:18,450 --> 01:04:19,670
And what happened to that dude?

2342
01:04:19,671 --> 01:04:22,370
That dude get arrested for refusing
a fucking a hundred years old.

2343
01:04:22,490 --> 01:04:26,300
You give that guy of metal and a gallon
of milk and you're going to say you give

2344
01:04:26,301 --> 01:04:28,350
him a fucking bell in
the pass at Disneyland.

2345
01:04:28,950 --> 01:04:30,000
That guy's boss.

2346
01:04:30,110 --> 01:04:30,591
You know what I'm saying?

2347
01:04:30,591 --> 01:04:32,300
When they get to be 80 he was like,

2348
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:34,600
I'm going to say he was like 68 right.

2349
01:04:34,610 --> 01:04:35,443
But just to say,

2350
01:04:35,570 --> 01:04:38,080
and do you remember like they
had footage of them subtle,

2351
01:04:38,600 --> 01:04:41,930
something hit him like
out there with a gun,

2352
01:04:41,931 --> 01:04:44,900
like come back Negro in
Chicago running behind,

2353
01:04:45,110 --> 01:04:45,560
boom.

2354
01:04:45,560 --> 01:04:47,640
And then he went back in the
house and called the web.

2355
01:04:49,160 --> 01:04:49,611
Yes.

2356
01:04:49,611 --> 01:04:52,430
He could dial nine one
one they said I got it.

2357
01:04:53,630 --> 01:04:54,020
Yeah,

2358
01:04:54,020 --> 01:04:57,170
but what I was saying to you is
they charge you with something Joe.

2359
01:04:57,171 --> 01:04:59,200
So it makes the plea bargain easier.

2360
01:04:59,230 --> 01:04:59,730
Right.

2361
01:04:59,730 --> 01:05:00,563
I understand.

2362
01:05:00,780 --> 01:05:02,690
I understand that they
can use it to arrest.

2363
01:05:02,710 --> 01:05:03,543
Come bags.

2364
01:05:03,590 --> 01:05:03,801
Hey,

2365
01:05:03,801 --> 01:05:05,300
we smelled pot.

2366
01:05:05,570 --> 01:05:06,051
We came in,

2367
01:05:06,051 --> 01:05:07,630
he had white slavery going on.

2368
01:05:07,640 --> 01:05:08,690
Just getting high at the same time.

2369
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:09,673
I can understand.

2370
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:10,430
I can understand.

2371
01:05:10,430 --> 01:05:14,540
I understand the idea behind making
it easier for law enforcement.

2372
01:05:14,541 --> 01:05:17,150
I'm hundred percent pro law enforcement.

2373
01:05:17,380 --> 01:05:18,340
I know a lot

2374
01:05:18,340 --> 01:05:21,460
of cops and I know a lot of good cops
and I know a lot of cops that are good

2375
01:05:21,461 --> 01:05:22,180
dudes.

2376
01:05:22,180 --> 01:05:23,940
And I know most cops get a shitty wrapped.

2377
01:05:23,941 --> 01:05:25,370
But most of the time when
you're talking to the cops,

2378
01:05:25,371 --> 01:05:26,440
it's cause you fucked up.

2379
01:05:26,680 --> 01:05:27,371
That's reality.

2380
01:05:27,371 --> 01:05:28,690
And we've all fucked up before.

2381
01:05:28,870 --> 01:05:33,140
But I've found in my life that if
you're respectful and you treat the cops

2382
01:05:33,141 --> 01:05:35,590
straightforward and don't give
him a fucking hard time and,

2383
01:05:35,670 --> 01:05:37,630
and don't challenge their position,

2384
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:38,291
you know,

2385
01:05:38,291 --> 01:05:40,270
just accept what's going on.

2386
01:05:40,271 --> 01:05:41,260
He's doing a job.

2387
01:05:41,261 --> 01:05:42,940
We have fucking rules there.

2388
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:43,481
Society.

2389
01:05:43,481 --> 01:05:45,130
And this guy represents those rules.

2390
01:05:45,160 --> 01:05:46,210
So you treat her with respect.

2391
01:05:46,211 --> 01:05:47,020
Thank you sir.

2392
01:05:47,020 --> 01:05:48,790
And I've never had a
fucking problem with cops,

2393
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:50,500
but I'm not a criminal.

2394
01:05:50,740 --> 01:05:51,700
I'm not a scumbag.

2395
01:05:52,070 --> 01:05:54,320
I'm a criminal and I never
had problems with cops.

2396
01:05:54,530 --> 01:05:57,160
I had a cop one time
with handcuffs on gold,

2397
01:05:57,170 --> 01:05:58,430
my zipper pocket over here,

2398
01:05:58,431 --> 01:06:00,340
and I had 30 fucking volumes in there.

2399
01:06:00,341 --> 01:06:01,680
The blue owns the old school.

2400
01:06:01,820 --> 01:06:02,690
The v in the middle,

2401
01:06:02,930 --> 01:06:04,190
which would kill a fucking horse,

2402
01:06:04,220 --> 01:06:05,053
isn't have Viagara.

2403
01:06:05,060 --> 01:06:05,331
No.

2404
01:06:05,331 --> 01:06:09,350
He looked at them to say to fucking Momo
looked at Nfi aggravated to put them

2405
01:06:09,351 --> 01:06:10,850
fucking button and just smile.

2406
01:06:10,910 --> 01:06:11,930
I had a cop in bold,

2407
01:06:11,931 --> 01:06:12,410
really,

2408
01:06:12,410 --> 01:06:14,640
who I took my sides to
tell this story on stage.

2409
01:06:14,650 --> 01:06:14,841
The other,

2410
01:06:14,841 --> 01:06:15,674
when you got arrested,

2411
01:06:15,890 --> 01:06:17,540
you got to take your
shoes off then your socks,

2412
01:06:17,620 --> 01:06:18,860
but you have to turn your socks out.

2413
01:06:19,190 --> 01:06:21,490
I had this fucking skunk in my sneaker,

2414
01:06:21,700 --> 01:06:22,330
you know,

2415
01:06:22,330 --> 01:06:23,163
I had a deep,

2416
01:06:23,390 --> 01:06:23,871
deep,

2417
01:06:23,871 --> 01:06:24,770
deep in the yard.

2418
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:25,710
It was so much in there.

2419
01:06:25,711 --> 01:06:28,220
I was walking with a fucking
limp and they pulled me over.

2420
01:06:28,220 --> 01:06:29,120
I had a speeding ticket.

2421
01:06:29,121 --> 01:06:31,670
The Guy fucking arrested me
and when they'd take me back,

2422
01:06:31,671 --> 01:06:35,630
the guy who went to pull the sock off
and look at the week and he looked at it

2423
01:06:35,890 --> 01:06:36,541
as Joe.

2424
01:06:36,541 --> 01:06:37,580
He looked at his happiest.

2425
01:06:37,581 --> 01:06:38,414
She goes,

2426
01:06:38,510 --> 01:06:39,710
it's a Tiva season.

2427
01:06:39,740 --> 01:06:40,850
He didn't even know he was talking about.

2428
01:06:41,480 --> 01:06:44,330
The next day I go to get charged
and they tried with everything,

2429
01:06:44,331 --> 01:06:46,670
but they're not charging with the way
you've got to charge with the wheat.

2430
01:06:47,290 --> 01:06:47,540
Well,

2431
01:06:47,540 --> 01:06:49,450
he stole my weakness
and charging me ticket.

2432
01:06:50,120 --> 01:06:50,953
Fuck you.

2433
01:06:51,140 --> 01:06:52,820
If you're going to charge it
and trials and everything,

2434
01:06:52,821 --> 01:06:53,511
you'd take my week.

2435
01:06:53,511 --> 01:06:56,970
Just tried to me one day he tried to run
everything except the fucking Charlie

2436
01:06:56,971 --> 01:06:57,860
wanted the weed.

2437
01:06:57,861 --> 01:06:58,880
If he charged you with the weed,

2438
01:06:58,881 --> 01:06:59,930
he couldn't keep the weed.

2439
01:06:59,990 --> 01:07:00,380
I've been,

2440
01:07:00,380 --> 01:07:01,340
I've been the one thing,

2441
01:07:01,341 --> 01:07:02,061
I was pretty simple.

2442
01:07:02,061 --> 01:07:05,390
I fucked up a lot and I've
always had no problems.

2443
01:07:05,590 --> 01:07:06,190
Big Man.

2444
01:07:06,190 --> 01:07:06,360
Look,

2445
01:07:06,360 --> 01:07:08,080
I know there's some dirty cops out there.

2446
01:07:08,081 --> 01:07:09,430
I know there's bad cops.

2447
01:07:09,431 --> 01:07:09,880
I know that.

2448
01:07:09,880 --> 01:07:10,251
I know that.

2449
01:07:10,251 --> 01:07:10,490
Some,

2450
01:07:10,490 --> 01:07:11,440
I've read some shit.

2451
01:07:11,441 --> 01:07:12,430
I've seen documentaries.

2452
01:07:12,431 --> 01:07:14,380
I know there's no bad everything.

2453
01:07:14,410 --> 01:07:18,790
I watched the cocaine cowboys where they
talk about how the entire fucking year

2454
01:07:18,791 --> 01:07:19,660
graduating year,

2455
01:07:19,661 --> 01:07:20,171
one year,

2456
01:07:20,171 --> 01:07:21,370
it was like 84 or something.

2457
01:07:21,550 --> 01:07:22,990
The entire graduating year,

2458
01:07:22,991 --> 01:07:24,280
the Miami Police Department,

2459
01:07:24,300 --> 01:07:24,431
the,

2460
01:07:24,431 --> 01:07:24,560
the,

2461
01:07:24,560 --> 01:07:24,761
the,

2462
01:07:24,761 --> 01:07:25,300
what was it,

2463
01:07:25,300 --> 01:07:26,140
what is the police?

2464
01:07:26,141 --> 01:07:26,974
Uh,

2465
01:07:26,990 --> 01:07:31,990
academy attire either died or got
murdered or got put in prison.

2466
01:07:32,140 --> 01:07:33,220
All of them became corrupt.

2467
01:07:33,790 --> 01:07:34,061
It was,

2468
01:07:34,061 --> 01:07:36,070
it was one of the worst
things that ever happened.

2469
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:37,600
It was like one of those things,

2470
01:07:37,601 --> 01:07:38,680
what is it when you have to open up,

2471
01:07:38,681 --> 01:07:43,681
they open up a program in Miami in 82 to
promote more police officers that were

2472
01:07:44,471 --> 01:07:45,304
Spanish.

2473
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:47,140
So they took all these cops.

2474
01:07:47,141 --> 01:07:49,360
I had juvenile records
like a motherfucker.

2475
01:07:49,361 --> 01:07:53,230
All these kids erased them and just
gave them jobs to give the department a

2476
01:07:53,231 --> 01:07:54,064
better thing.

2477
01:07:54,190 --> 01:07:56,410
And there was this one case
where they had these four cops,

2478
01:07:56,411 --> 01:07:58,570
I forget what they called
the harbor cops or whatever,

2479
01:07:58,870 --> 01:08:03,870
that they were just pulling people over
on the road shooting you and taking your

2480
01:08:04,541 --> 01:08:04,931
shit,

2481
01:08:04,931 --> 01:08:07,990
throwing you into roared all four of
them just on the road like pirates,

2482
01:08:07,991 --> 01:08:08,590
bro.

2483
01:08:08,590 --> 01:08:10,480
Then have your information and one guy,

2484
01:08:10,570 --> 01:08:11,530
what did they call them again?

2485
01:08:11,740 --> 01:08:15,290
I forget a four car and then
one got out and this happened.

2486
01:08:15,291 --> 01:08:16,370
The navy three

2487
01:08:16,370 --> 01:08:21,370
82 and the one guy got out in 99 and he
became a cook at club mumble in coconut

2488
01:08:22,131 --> 01:08:22,521
grove.

2489
01:08:22,521 --> 01:08:24,740
And they had signs all
over cooking the grove,

2490
01:08:24,950 --> 01:08:25,790
don't hire him,

2491
01:08:25,791 --> 01:08:26,870
don't go to Mambo.

2492
01:08:27,080 --> 01:08:28,010
The guy was a killer.

2493
01:08:28,011 --> 01:08:28,641
They would kill us.

2494
01:08:28,641 --> 01:08:29,474
They were just going to,

2495
01:08:29,570 --> 01:08:31,940
they weren't even arrested and they would
just go on and you'd have to know him.

2496
01:08:31,941 --> 01:08:32,610
Brian Reichel.

2497
01:08:32,610 --> 01:08:36,680
How did that guy get out of jail by
your hair blowing your brains out,

2498
01:08:36,681 --> 01:08:37,880
throwing you over the causeway,

2499
01:08:38,180 --> 01:08:40,120
taking your Mercedes
with the fucking porch.

2500
01:08:40,180 --> 01:08:41,240
I'm going it back.

2501
01:08:41,480 --> 01:08:42,740
When they each got popped,

2502
01:08:42,741 --> 01:08:47,300
they each had millions plus they
each had 300 kilos of cocaine.

2503
01:08:47,540 --> 01:08:49,100
Like they were so far gone,

2504
01:08:49,101 --> 01:08:49,791
doing blown.

2505
01:08:49,791 --> 01:08:50,660
Just shoot with people.

2506
01:08:50,990 --> 01:08:53,300
The harbor cobb's the roadway cops,

2507
01:08:53,301 --> 01:08:53,870
the,

2508
01:08:53,870 --> 01:08:56,260
and there were all these crazy
little fucking specs that,

2509
01:08:56,330 --> 01:08:56,630
you know,

2510
01:08:56,630 --> 01:08:59,030
Cuban kids dog that had juvenile records,

2511
01:08:59,360 --> 01:09:00,680
but they had a promote them.

2512
01:09:00,770 --> 01:09:01,880
How'd they get out of jail?

2513
01:09:02,480 --> 01:09:04,230
I mean half of them got shouted.

2514
01:09:04,250 --> 01:09:05,000
Fuck knows.

2515
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:05,220
I mean,

2516
01:09:05,220 --> 01:09:05,531
is it,

2517
01:09:05,531 --> 01:09:06,980
I mean when you do something like that,

2518
01:09:06,981 --> 01:09:08,210
you got to get life right.

2519
01:09:08,420 --> 01:09:11,390
If they catch you executing people,

2520
01:09:11,660 --> 01:09:11,901
what did,

2521
01:09:11,901 --> 01:09:12,530
what the fuck did they,

2522
01:09:12,530 --> 01:09:13,221
how was this guy?

2523
01:09:13,221 --> 01:09:14,320
How's it possible that he got,

2524
01:09:14,321 --> 01:09:15,154
could've got out.

2525
01:09:16,220 --> 01:09:17,510
I have no fucking idea,

2526
01:09:17,511 --> 01:09:18,800
but I was 20 fucking years.

2527
01:09:18,801 --> 01:09:19,634
I'm sorry about that.

2528
01:09:20,330 --> 01:09:21,680
So you vibrating over there.

2529
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:23,541
So what does it,

2530
01:09:23,541 --> 01:09:28,100
just different laws back then up to
the cops or different laws for like,

2531
01:09:28,101 --> 01:09:28,731
listen dog,

2532
01:09:28,731 --> 01:09:29,321
if I give you the,

2533
01:09:29,321 --> 01:09:30,410
always remember one time,

2534
01:09:30,411 --> 01:09:34,310
this is why people don't explain this
on television or what he's getting 10

2535
01:09:34,311 --> 01:09:34,701
years,

2536
01:09:34,701 --> 01:09:36,080
he's getting four fucking years.

2537
01:09:37,210 --> 01:09:37,790
Okay?

2538
01:09:37,790 --> 01:09:38,710
He's getting four fucking years,

2539
01:09:38,711 --> 01:09:39,830
especially with overcrowding door,

2540
01:09:39,831 --> 01:09:40,341
four years,

2541
01:09:40,341 --> 01:09:41,300
overcrowded prisons,

2542
01:09:41,301 --> 01:09:42,134
programs,

2543
01:09:42,140 --> 01:09:43,580
first time offenders,

2544
01:09:43,790 --> 01:09:46,370
you know all this fucking
bullshit that you qualify for,

2545
01:09:46,371 --> 01:09:47,600
especially if you're not in violence.

2546
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:49,700
So what you sold the grandma fucking blow.

2547
01:09:50,010 --> 01:09:52,040
They don't want you in
there really in a way.

2548
01:09:52,041 --> 01:09:52,510
You know,

2549
01:09:52,510 --> 01:09:54,320
they'll make you pay it and
get the fuck out of there.

2550
01:09:54,530 --> 01:09:55,101
You're going to pay,

2551
01:09:55,101 --> 01:09:56,340
it's going to cost you to get out of it.

2552
01:09:56,370 --> 01:09:57,110
But this guy,

2553
01:09:57,110 --> 01:09:58,820
these guys were like hardcore murder,

2554
01:09:58,880 --> 01:09:59,600
hardcore murder,

2555
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:01,340
but they still get out before,

2556
01:10:01,430 --> 01:10:03,920
I think the one guy got out.

2557
01:10:03,921 --> 01:10:07,070
But you gotta remember this was 84 and
we weren't in coconut grove in 2000,

2558
01:10:07,460 --> 01:10:08,780
so that's 15 fucking years.

2559
01:10:08,781 --> 01:10:11,540
So they gave this guy a
20 year sentence member.

2560
01:10:11,541 --> 01:10:12,860
The more the violent crime,

2561
01:10:12,861 --> 01:10:14,300
the parole board turns you down.

2562
01:10:14,570 --> 01:10:15,590
So if you're getting 20 years,

2563
01:10:15,591 --> 01:10:16,191
you do 10.

2564
01:10:16,191 --> 01:10:20,960
But the parole board could turn you down
eight times is even if you do heinous

2565
01:10:20,961 --> 01:10:21,291
shit,

2566
01:10:21,291 --> 01:10:21,471
man.

2567
01:10:21,471 --> 01:10:24,980
There was a dude who got released a couple
of years ago in Houston and this guy,

2568
01:10:24,981 --> 01:10:25,400
uh,

2569
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:26,330
years ago,

2570
01:10:26,390 --> 01:10:27,440
I forget how many,

2571
01:10:27,710 --> 01:10:28,170
uh,

2572
01:10:28,170 --> 01:10:29,120
it was a long time ago,

2573
01:10:29,121 --> 01:10:32,300
murdered some grandmother
and this little girl,

2574
01:10:32,720 --> 01:10:35,510
I think the girl was like three or
four and he drowned her in the fucking

2575
01:10:35,511 --> 01:10:35,991
toilet,

2576
01:10:35,991 --> 01:10:36,824
man.

2577
01:10:36,830 --> 01:10:38,540
I mean this guy was a killer.

2578
01:10:38,570 --> 01:10:41,360
This guy was a hardcore evil motherfucker.

2579
01:10:41,361 --> 01:10:43,760
Killed this grandmother
in front of the daughter,

2580
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,340
the granddaughter and the good dark
granddaughters making too much noise.

2581
01:10:46,341 --> 01:10:49,850
So he drowned her in the toilet and killed
the both of them and went to jail and

2582
01:10:49,851 --> 01:10:51,470
then they let them out and
then we'll let him out.

2583
01:10:51,471 --> 01:10:54,350
He just immediately started
killing checks immediately.

2584
01:10:55,070 --> 01:10:56,360
By the time they got to his house,

2585
01:10:56,840 --> 01:10:59,600
they found a one of those big drums,

2586
01:10:59,660 --> 01:11:03,650
those big metal drums with some woman
chopped up and stuffed inside of it and

2587
01:11:03,651 --> 01:11:06,020
they found evidence of another
murder somewhere else in this house.

2588
01:11:06,021 --> 01:11:07,280
And then they couldn't find the fuck.

2589
01:11:07,700 --> 01:11:09,230
I don't know if they
ever saw many fucked up.

2590
01:11:09,231 --> 01:11:09,771
But then again,

2591
01:11:09,771 --> 01:11:13,520
you're a very intelligent guy and you
understand that people make mistakes when

2592
01:11:13,530 --> 01:11:14,280
you can drown

2593
01:11:14,280 --> 01:11:14,860
a baby.

2594
01:11:14,860 --> 01:11:15,840
Sure you're dead.

2595
01:11:15,870 --> 01:11:18,150
So you right now what I'm
trying to say to you in person,

2596
01:11:18,210 --> 01:11:20,220
I'm trying to say to
you is things are bad.

2597
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:21,360
I got a family,

2598
01:11:21,570 --> 01:11:24,300
I know people and I go out
there and I sling some weeds.

2599
01:11:24,301 --> 01:11:26,580
I get fucking eight years for
swinging fucking weed and they,

2600
01:11:26,581 --> 01:11:28,650
and they locked me and put
me under the fucking jail.

2601
01:11:28,950 --> 01:11:31,860
But this guy that the system
failed and they let their mind,

2602
01:11:31,890 --> 01:11:33,980
and this is the flaws I
see that they got out.

2603
01:11:34,010 --> 01:11:35,040
They listen man.

2604
01:11:35,700 --> 01:11:37,920
If it's your first time
offender and for cocaine,

2605
01:11:37,921 --> 01:11:41,550
I think they should give
you a stiff penalty upfront
so you understand what it's

2606
01:11:41,551 --> 01:11:42,720
like behind back there.

2607
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:44,280
And that's the only way you'll learn.

2608
01:11:44,281 --> 01:11:45,420
The same way I learned,

2609
01:11:45,810 --> 01:11:48,150
because once you go back there
and they ain't no fucking joke,

2610
01:11:48,270 --> 01:11:50,820
and I'm not talking about what are you
going to get a rate and don't drop the

2611
01:11:50,821 --> 01:11:53,910
song I'm talking about
you miss your peeps,

2612
01:11:53,911 --> 01:11:54,330
Bro,

2613
01:11:54,330 --> 01:11:54,500
right?

2614
01:11:54,500 --> 01:11:56,250
The people who love you
and have faith in you,

2615
01:11:56,270 --> 01:11:57,210
they're the ones you hurt.

2616
01:11:57,450 --> 01:11:58,800
And when you see their faces,

2617
01:11:58,920 --> 01:12:00,090
that's when you make a decision.

2618
01:12:00,091 --> 01:12:02,310
Either you're going to go back
there or you're fucking not.

2619
01:12:02,311 --> 01:12:05,220
I feel that everybody should pay
for what they've done in society.

2620
01:12:05,221 --> 01:12:06,510
It's the only way you're
going to learn from it.

2621
01:12:06,780 --> 01:12:08,220
I keep giving you probation.

2622
01:12:08,340 --> 01:12:10,520
You're going to keep doing the
same shit and let's do it all hand.

2623
01:12:10,530 --> 01:12:15,530
Nothing these fucking years with a bunch
of hard sisters with no fucking Afro

2624
01:12:16,200 --> 01:12:16,830
Sheen and their hair,

2625
01:12:16,830 --> 01:12:17,670
when they start looking like,

2626
01:12:17,671 --> 01:12:17,921
fuck,

2627
01:12:17,921 --> 01:12:18,754
I'm a Goomba.

2628
01:12:18,810 --> 01:12:20,130
You'll see what fucking happens.

2629
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:21,690
You'll see what fucking happens.

2630
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:22,280
You'll see us.

2631
01:12:22,280 --> 01:12:25,020
You have a shoplift again dog
and up from the honest truth.

2632
01:12:25,170 --> 01:12:27,650
When you start sitting down and talking
to people and the way you and I talking

2633
01:12:27,651 --> 01:12:28,110
about,

2634
01:12:28,110 --> 01:12:28,291
oh,

2635
01:12:28,291 --> 01:12:30,300
we fucked this check or we did a show.

2636
01:12:30,300 --> 01:12:33,300
When I talk to you and saying that the
time I snapped that mother fucking the

2637
01:12:33,301 --> 01:12:33,570
neck,

2638
01:12:33,570 --> 01:12:35,100
that was my best day of my life.

2639
01:12:35,101 --> 01:12:35,934
And you're like,

2640
01:12:36,360 --> 01:12:37,193
uh,

2641
01:12:37,530 --> 01:12:38,080
this ain't,

2642
01:12:38,080 --> 01:12:40,200
that motherfucking has
covered to make its baptism.

2643
01:12:40,530 --> 01:12:41,221
You understand me?

2644
01:12:41,221 --> 01:12:42,960
So I feel that.

2645
01:12:42,961 --> 01:12:43,380
Yeah,

2646
01:12:43,380 --> 01:12:46,230
but for me to give you like a Michigan,

2647
01:12:46,231 --> 01:12:46,621
I'm reading,

2648
01:12:46,621 --> 01:12:50,400
they give motherfuckers 12 years for
selling cocaine on the street and shit.

2649
01:12:50,520 --> 01:12:51,480
12 years old.

2650
01:12:51,481 --> 01:12:52,680
He is nine years.

2651
01:12:52,681 --> 01:12:52,951
Hey,

2652
01:12:52,951 --> 01:12:53,760
four years.

2653
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:56,130
Did you hear about what they're doing
in Palm Beach County in Florida?

2654
01:12:56,450 --> 01:12:56,681
He here,

2655
01:12:56,681 --> 01:12:57,570
they're having kids,

2656
01:12:58,200 --> 01:12:59,033
young,

2657
01:12:59,190 --> 01:13:03,330
1920 year old cops and they're putting
them in high school and they're busting

2658
01:13:03,331 --> 01:13:04,260
kids for selling weed.

2659
01:13:05,310 --> 01:13:06,110
Have you heard about this?

2660
01:13:06,110 --> 01:13:06,930
Yeah,

2661
01:13:06,930 --> 01:13:07,790
we talked about Rogen.

2662
01:13:07,830 --> 01:13:07,931
Yeah,

2663
01:13:07,931 --> 01:13:08,960
we talked about him before we left.

2664
01:13:08,990 --> 01:13:09,990
Do you have three children?

2665
01:13:10,170 --> 01:13:12,240
What do you want to do
you you're mad at that?

2666
01:13:12,540 --> 01:13:13,020
Yeah.

2667
01:13:13,020 --> 01:13:13,261
Yeah,

2668
01:13:13,261 --> 01:13:14,094
I am at tech.

2669
01:13:14,290 --> 01:13:16,260
It's high school and they're smoking weed.

2670
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:17,720
That's all you're arrested him for.

2671
01:13:17,820 --> 01:13:18,031
Look,

2672
01:13:18,031 --> 01:13:22,340
if you're resting is on the cover of
a murder for hire plots and you know

2673
01:13:22,350 --> 01:13:24,660
they're planning on knocking over banks
and shit when they get out of high

2674
01:13:24,661 --> 01:13:24,901
school.

2675
01:13:24,901 --> 01:13:25,101
Yeah,

2676
01:13:25,101 --> 01:13:25,261
yeah,

2677
01:13:25,261 --> 01:13:25,481
yeah.

2678
01:13:25,481 --> 01:13:28,290
I'm not a rust and for that
I understand it's just pot.

2679
01:13:28,410 --> 01:13:29,161
It's all they did.

2680
01:13:29,161 --> 01:13:32,070
They went in and this chick pretended
to be a fucking high school student.

2681
01:13:32,190 --> 01:13:32,401
Hey,

2682
01:13:32,401 --> 01:13:33,211
you guys want to buy pot?

2683
01:13:33,211 --> 01:13:33,511
And they're like,

2684
01:13:33,511 --> 01:13:33,781
yeah,

2685
01:13:33,781 --> 01:13:36,000
well you got some next thing
and now they're in jail.

2686
01:13:36,300 --> 01:13:37,950
I mean the whole thing's ridiculous.

2687
01:13:37,960 --> 01:13:39,450
That's now our tax dollars.

2688
01:13:39,451 --> 01:13:42,780
Went for a woman to pretend that she
was in high school so she could find out

2689
01:13:42,781 --> 01:13:43,620
who's got the weed.

2690
01:13:44,290 --> 01:13:45,123
You know

2691
01:13:46,530 --> 01:13:47,400
you have children now,

2692
01:13:47,401 --> 01:13:49,230
so you understand that
when you've said it,

2693
01:13:49,260 --> 01:13:50,520
I've heard it come out of your mouth.

2694
01:13:50,970 --> 01:13:53,520
You know that that's west
blurb and that Miami,

2695
01:13:53,550 --> 01:13:54,570
that areas assessed.

2696
01:13:54,590 --> 01:13:55,423
Pull the phone.

2697
01:13:56,580 --> 01:13:57,331
Let's be honest.

2698
01:13:57,331 --> 01:13:59,180
But the problem with that area's pills.

2699
01:14:00,680 --> 01:14:01,010
Well,

2700
01:14:01,010 --> 01:14:02,280
if that even makes it worse,

2701
01:14:02,340 --> 01:14:03,260
my fucking lip.

2702
01:14:03,380 --> 01:14:05,490
The problem is pills and
pills are everywhere.

2703
01:14:05,550 --> 01:14:07,500
We talked about it on the podcast before,

2704
01:14:07,501 --> 01:14:08,370
but if you haven't seen it,

2705
01:14:08,580 --> 01:14:09,870
it's available online.

2706
01:14:10,470 --> 01:14:12,280
You need to watch episode of Van Guard

2707
01:14:12,280 --> 01:14:17,280
called the Oxycontin Express and
they go into a vanguard is this net?

2708
01:14:17,470 --> 01:14:20,740
It's one of those shows on one of those
weird networks or you're not exactly

2709
01:14:20,741 --> 01:14:21,311
sure what it is,

2710
01:14:21,311 --> 01:14:22,900
like true TV or some shit like that.

2711
01:14:22,901 --> 01:14:25,300
But if you can find it on your Dvr,

2712
01:14:25,301 --> 01:14:29,590
it's the shit because they go on
these like investigative journalistic

2713
01:14:29,591 --> 01:14:31,540
adventures and undercover a lot of shit.

2714
01:14:31,690 --> 01:14:34,330
And one of the things they did is they
uncovered the whole situation down in

2715
01:14:34,331 --> 01:14:35,020
Florida.

2716
01:14:35,020 --> 01:14:36,580
It's called the Oxycontin Express.

2717
01:14:36,581 --> 01:14:39,340
And it shows how they have these
pain management centers in Florida.

2718
01:14:39,670 --> 01:14:41,230
And Florida doesn't have a database.

2719
01:14:41,231 --> 01:14:43,840
So if you got a
prescription for Oxycontin,

2720
01:14:43,870 --> 01:14:45,640
which you could easily down there say,

2721
01:14:45,641 --> 01:14:45,821
oh,

2722
01:14:45,821 --> 01:14:46,840
my back's fucked up.

2723
01:14:46,841 --> 01:14:47,411
They look at you,

2724
01:14:47,411 --> 01:14:47,950
they go,

2725
01:14:47,950 --> 01:14:49,270
one of the guys a little overweight,

2726
01:14:49,271 --> 01:14:50,290
maybe he's got a back problem.

2727
01:14:50,291 --> 01:14:50,890
Here you go,

2728
01:14:50,890 --> 01:14:52,000
they write you a prescription,

2729
01:14:52,001 --> 01:14:56,530
they're in the office and you go right
next door in the same fucking building.

2730
01:14:56,620 --> 01:14:58,750
And they've got the Oxycontin
and they sell it to you.

2731
01:14:58,900 --> 01:15:02,530
It's like they're legal heroin
dealers and they have no database.

2732
01:15:02,590 --> 01:15:05,710
So if you went to doctor Joey
Diaz and got your prescription,

2733
01:15:06,250 --> 01:15:07,330
you could get out of the car,

2734
01:15:07,450 --> 01:15:10,780
drive right down the street and go to
doctor Joe Rogan and doctor Joe Rogan

2735
01:15:10,781 --> 01:15:11,950
writes a prescription for you too.

2736
01:15:12,070 --> 01:15:13,270
And then you go down the street,

2737
01:15:13,390 --> 01:15:16,540
another fucking 20 miles down the road
and get another prescription and you can

2738
01:15:16,541 --> 01:15:18,580
do it over and over again
because they can't compare.

2739
01:15:18,670 --> 01:15:22,000
So you can just show up these pain
management centers and get 30,

2740
01:15:22,001 --> 01:15:23,080
40 fucking pills.

2741
01:15:23,260 --> 01:15:27,040
And these people are the
called the oxycontin express
because people are driving

2742
01:15:27,041 --> 01:15:28,900
down from Kentucky and Ohio.

2743
01:15:28,990 --> 01:15:31,780
They're driving down this
highway to access the,

2744
01:15:31,781 --> 01:15:31,961
uh,

2745
01:15:31,961 --> 01:15:33,730
the Florida fucking oxycontin.

2746
01:15:33,910 --> 01:15:35,440
They're hanging out and fun in this place.

2747
01:15:35,441 --> 01:15:35,681
I mean,

2748
01:15:35,681 --> 01:15:36,730
it is a trip,

2749
01:15:36,731 --> 01:15:37,220
man.

2750
01:15:37,220 --> 01:15:37,450
They,

2751
01:15:37,450 --> 01:15:39,070
they show the inside of this building.

2752
01:15:39,190 --> 01:15:43,840
This is all these people Jones in and
walking back and forth like zombies and

2753
01:15:43,841 --> 01:15:46,300
they're sitting there smoking cigarettes
sitting in front of the place,

2754
01:15:46,301 --> 01:15:47,134
waiting for

2755
01:15:47,950 --> 01:15:49,210
it's fucking nuts,

2756
01:15:49,211 --> 01:15:49,630
man.

2757
01:15:49,630 --> 01:15:51,400
The waiting to get in and get their shit.

2758
01:15:51,700 --> 01:15:55,120
And they have all these undercover
comics in the undercover cameras are in

2759
01:15:55,550 --> 01:15:56,520
interviewing all these people.

2760
01:15:56,530 --> 01:15:57,610
So where are you coming from?

2761
01:15:57,611 --> 01:15:57,800
Me,

2762
01:15:57,800 --> 01:15:58,900
I'm coming to him conduct the,

2763
01:15:58,901 --> 01:16:00,610
I'm make this trip once a month,

2764
01:16:00,670 --> 01:16:00,920
you know,

2765
01:16:00,920 --> 01:16:03,040
I'm need most dope so he can't get,

2766
01:16:03,041 --> 01:16:04,060
can't get it in Kentucky,

2767
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:06,970
they have the bus and people
left and right and said,

2768
01:16:08,140 --> 01:16:09,400
I don't know if it's on Netflix.

2769
01:16:09,401 --> 01:16:13,510
I know I watched it online and
then I found the show on TV.

2770
01:16:13,511 --> 01:16:16,050
I didn't even know about the show
to somebody that's on Twitter.

2771
01:16:16,051 --> 01:16:16,900
It's at boulevard.

2772
01:16:17,560 --> 01:16:19,410
Everybody's holding on the documentary,

2773
01:16:19,880 --> 01:16:24,860
the documentary's everybody look
you mean that you can get oxycontin.

2774
01:16:24,930 --> 01:16:28,180
I know a dude who had a problem and
he had a problem because he got a

2775
01:16:28,181 --> 01:16:31,210
prescription for it when he lived in
Texas and then he moved to California.

2776
01:16:31,211 --> 01:16:34,330
He got another prescription for it
here and decided to just have himself a

2777
01:16:34,331 --> 01:16:35,260
little fucking party.

2778
01:16:35,410 --> 01:16:36,191
And so when he did that,

2779
01:16:36,191 --> 01:16:37,024
he got jacked.

2780
01:16:40,130 --> 01:16:41,500
That looks like Kermit the frog.

2781
01:16:43,140 --> 01:16:45,220
The body of Christ compels you.

2782
01:16:45,490 --> 01:16:47,110
I overdosed the other day,

2783
01:16:47,111 --> 01:16:47,470
Jeff.

2784
01:16:47,470 --> 01:16:47,771
Yeah,

2785
01:16:47,771 --> 01:16:50,790
I heard you can eat that
whole thing or you fuck you.

2786
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:51,633
Fuck you.

2787
01:16:52,690 --> 01:16:53,380
I'm scared.

2788
01:16:53,380 --> 01:16:54,310
I'm scared of that cookie.

2789
01:16:54,311 --> 01:16:56,590
So I had mushrooms and solving,

2790
01:16:56,591 --> 01:16:58,600
I don't really remember it and
it wasn't that big of a trip.

2791
01:16:58,601 --> 01:17:00,130
So I've been kind of Joan solving,

2792
01:17:00,370 --> 01:17:01,550
which people should know is in town.

2793
01:17:01,551 --> 01:17:02,440
So he up there,

2794
01:17:02,441 --> 01:17:03,670
it's like wine country,

2795
01:17:04,020 --> 01:17:04,211
go.

2796
01:17:04,211 --> 01:17:05,500
Which girl have a nice time,

2797
01:17:05,501 --> 01:17:07,390
pop a few mushrooms and it did.

2798
01:17:07,410 --> 01:17:08,880
It wasn't as good as I wanted,

2799
01:17:08,890 --> 01:17:10,040
so I've been kind of Jonesing

2800
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:10,821
to do it again.

2801
01:17:10,821 --> 01:17:11,840
So me and my girlfriend were like,

2802
01:17:11,841 --> 01:17:12,230
Hey,

2803
01:17:12,230 --> 01:17:13,050
let's do you,

2804
01:17:13,050 --> 01:17:15,170
are you measuring your dose or
you just like looking at it?

2805
01:17:15,410 --> 01:17:16,010
Um,

2806
01:17:16,010 --> 01:17:20,360
I usually buy like a quarter or an
eighth and usually take half of that.

2807
01:17:20,361 --> 01:17:21,330
And Eighth of an artist?

2808
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:22,460
Yes.

2809
01:17:22,460 --> 01:17:23,090
Okay.

2810
01:17:23,090 --> 01:17:23,660
What is a,

2811
01:17:23,660 --> 01:17:24,860
what does announced 16 grams?

2812
01:17:25,770 --> 01:17:26,300
What does it,

2813
01:17:26,300 --> 01:17:27,200
I saw it the beautiful,

2814
01:17:27,500 --> 01:17:28,790
what does announce 16 grams?

2815
01:17:28,820 --> 01:17:29,780
I don't know.

2816
01:17:29,781 --> 01:17:31,310
I don't go by ounces at all.

2817
01:17:31,311 --> 01:17:31,880
I always just,

2818
01:17:31,880 --> 01:17:33,670
my by quarters and an age,

2819
01:17:34,520 --> 01:17:37,880
28 to 28 grams a quarter,

2820
01:17:37,910 --> 01:17:38,743
half a quarter,

2821
01:17:38,840 --> 01:17:39,501
half a quarter.

2822
01:17:39,501 --> 01:17:41,990
So quarter to seven fucking
grant and you're reading a Naif.

2823
01:17:42,230 --> 01:17:42,650
Okay.

2824
01:17:42,650 --> 01:17:44,010
So I ate,

2825
01:17:44,140 --> 01:17:47,180
I ate a full quarter if
not more this time around.

2826
01:17:47,390 --> 01:17:49,250
And so you went over five grams?

2827
01:17:49,251 --> 01:17:49,470
Yeah,

2828
01:17:49,470 --> 01:17:50,260
he's fucking crazy.

2829
01:17:50,260 --> 01:17:50,500
Oh No.

2830
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:52,160
I went over probably a quarter.

2831
01:17:52,950 --> 01:17:54,110
Seven grams or more.

2832
01:17:54,111 --> 01:17:55,580
So you crossed over to the dark side?

2833
01:17:55,580 --> 01:17:55,730
Yeah,

2834
01:17:55,730 --> 01:17:56,620
it was the,

2835
01:17:56,630 --> 01:17:57,421
what happened is,

2836
01:17:57,421 --> 01:17:57,960
is the,

2837
01:17:57,960 --> 01:17:58,521
the mushrooms like,

2838
01:17:58,521 --> 01:17:59,250
I don't know if I saw it,

2839
01:17:59,250 --> 01:18:00,083
you saw a picture.

2840
01:18:00,320 --> 01:18:02,890
One of the caps I had
was about the size of a,

2841
01:18:03,150 --> 01:18:04,490
a baseball,

2842
01:18:04,550 --> 01:18:06,880
maybe it was huge and uh,

2843
01:18:06,930 --> 01:18:08,570
the stem was about that big,

2844
01:18:08,571 --> 01:18:09,800
which was about the size of,

2845
01:18:09,801 --> 01:18:10,620
I don't know,

2846
01:18:10,620 --> 01:18:11,660
and and thick.

2847
01:18:11,690 --> 01:18:13,460
It was like a huge,

2848
01:18:13,461 --> 01:18:14,294
chunky fat.

2849
01:18:14,300 --> 01:18:16,850
I've never seen mushrooms that
I thought they weren't real.

2850
01:18:16,880 --> 01:18:17,840
Like I thought they were like,

2851
01:18:17,870 --> 01:18:20,990
they picked the wrong kind and it wasn't
going to work because there were so

2852
01:18:20,991 --> 01:18:21,230
big,

2853
01:18:21,230 --> 01:18:22,760
there was no way to really judge it.

2854
01:18:22,940 --> 01:18:23,780
So I'm just like fuck.

2855
01:18:23,820 --> 01:18:25,790
And a half of it I was,

2856
01:18:25,810 --> 01:18:26,960
it was the dumbest thing ever.

2857
01:18:26,961 --> 01:18:27,530
I was just,

2858
01:18:27,530 --> 01:18:27,920
I was,

2859
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:28,221
I was like,

2860
01:18:28,221 --> 01:18:28,641
you know what,

2861
01:18:28,641 --> 01:18:29,840
I want to see a lot of crazy shit.

2862
01:18:29,841 --> 01:18:31,010
I'm ready to go deep this time.

2863
01:18:31,130 --> 01:18:33,400
And so I made team a girl from a,

2864
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:34,433
uh,

2865
01:18:35,530 --> 01:18:36,171
with the mushrooms.

2866
01:18:36,171 --> 01:18:36,860
We both made money.

2867
01:18:36,860 --> 01:18:41,030
We both made our own separate t so we
both had about a quarter each and each one

2868
01:18:41,031 --> 01:18:41,864
of our teas.

2869
01:18:42,140 --> 01:18:45,860
And she only drank half of it because she
started feeling it halfway through the

2870
01:18:45,861 --> 01:18:46,070
tea,

2871
01:18:46,070 --> 01:18:46,881
drinking the tea.

2872
01:18:46,881 --> 01:18:47,540
She's,

2873
01:18:47,540 --> 01:18:47,721
yeah.

2874
01:18:47,721 --> 01:18:48,620
So she didn't eat,

2875
01:18:48,710 --> 01:18:52,640
I did it quick and I just ate it and
drank the whole thing real quick.

2876
01:18:52,850 --> 01:18:55,940
And then we're both laying on the
couch and my body starts twitching.

2877
01:18:56,090 --> 01:18:58,820
Like immediately I had all
these twitches over my body,

2878
01:18:58,821 --> 01:19:00,020
like it was twitching.

2879
01:19:00,530 --> 01:19:01,161
And uh,

2880
01:19:01,161 --> 01:19:03,470
the only thing I'm rumblings
of the universe coming.

2881
01:19:03,500 --> 01:19:03,980
Yeah.

2882
01:19:03,980 --> 01:19:05,060
The only thing I had eight today,

2883
01:19:05,061 --> 01:19:07,130
cause that's another thing in
solving that we had eight before.

2884
01:19:07,220 --> 01:19:09,950
So the only thing I eat today
that day was at beet salad.

2885
01:19:09,980 --> 01:19:10,970
That's how you're supposed to do it,

2886
01:19:10,990 --> 01:19:11,270
right?

2887
01:19:11,270 --> 01:19:13,200
You're supposed to fast for 12 hours.

2888
01:19:13,201 --> 01:19:16,430
So I had a small beat sound
like seriously small beats out.

2889
01:19:16,820 --> 01:19:20,890
So I'm laying on the couch and suddenly
I looked at my hand and it would turned

2890
01:19:20,891 --> 01:19:21,860
into triangles,

2891
01:19:22,100 --> 01:19:22,820
pyramids.

2892
01:19:22,820 --> 01:19:24,440
Like I couldn't see my fingers,

2893
01:19:24,441 --> 01:19:25,400
there were just tons,

2894
01:19:25,401 --> 01:19:26,540
a little pyramids.

2895
01:19:26,840 --> 01:19:29,500
And then I looked to the
ground dual geometric patterns.

2896
01:19:29,930 --> 01:19:31,520
And I've always had in the past,

2897
01:19:31,550 --> 01:19:32,420
whenever I was swimming,

2898
01:19:32,421 --> 01:19:33,320
I knew where I was.

2899
01:19:33,321 --> 01:19:34,940
I looked around and I saw the room.

2900
01:19:35,060 --> 01:19:36,020
I knew it was my room,

2901
01:19:36,021 --> 01:19:37,010
but it just look trippy.

2902
01:19:37,340 --> 01:19:38,061
This was like,

2903
01:19:38,061 --> 01:19:38,361
no,

2904
01:19:38,361 --> 01:19:41,360
I was not seeing anything
that looked familiar.

2905
01:19:41,390 --> 01:19:44,630
It was like pyramids and gears and,

2906
01:19:44,780 --> 01:19:45,290
and,

2907
01:19:45,290 --> 01:19:45,650
and,

2908
01:19:45,650 --> 01:19:46,070
uh,

2909
01:19:46,070 --> 01:19:49,200
a lot of clock tower type things like
inside a clock where it has all this,

2910
01:19:49,201 --> 01:19:50,120
the gears and stuff.

2911
01:19:50,710 --> 01:19:53,090
It's like you seeing the inner
workings of the universe.

2912
01:19:53,240 --> 01:19:56,300
And so me and my girlfriend
both fucked up as hell.

2913
01:19:56,300 --> 01:19:56,601
We're like,

2914
01:19:56,601 --> 01:19:56,811
you know,

2915
01:19:56,811 --> 01:20:00,240
let's go upstairs and lay in your bed and
just chill out and look at things that

2916
01:20:00,241 --> 01:20:01,074
you get upstairs.

2917
01:20:01,120 --> 01:20:01,530
Uh,

2918
01:20:01,530 --> 01:20:05,600
I fell to the ground four times
while walking up to the stairs.

2919
01:20:05,601 --> 01:20:07,220
My feet would not work anymore.

2920
01:20:07,530 --> 01:20:10,600
My legs just would not work and
you're supposed to be lying down yet.

2921
01:20:10,710 --> 01:20:13,650
So I laid down and it started smelling
like dog pee where I was laying,

2922
01:20:13,651 --> 01:20:13,841
sorry,

2923
01:20:13,841 --> 01:20:17,590
I was trying to crawl and
so it's trying to crawl.

2924
01:20:17,591 --> 01:20:22,080
So I somehow got in bed and I'm
looking at what was the ceiling fan.

2925
01:20:22,081 --> 01:20:24,000
But to me it was just a spinning vibe,

2926
01:20:24,210 --> 01:20:24,510
like,

2927
01:20:24,510 --> 01:20:25,740
like black hole,

2928
01:20:25,830 --> 01:20:27,180
like fucking of colors.

2929
01:20:27,181 --> 01:20:28,080
And I did,

2930
01:20:28,170 --> 01:20:29,160
I thought it was dead.

2931
01:20:29,190 --> 01:20:29,760
I was like,

2932
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:30,593
I am dead.

2933
01:20:30,630 --> 01:20:32,850
And then I just started
getting really sick,

2934
01:20:33,060 --> 01:20:33,450
like,

2935
01:20:33,450 --> 01:20:33,810
like,

2936
01:20:33,810 --> 01:20:35,430
like a poisoned sick.

2937
01:20:35,580 --> 01:20:36,331
And so then I was like,

2938
01:20:36,331 --> 01:20:36,840
Holy Shit,

2939
01:20:36,840 --> 01:20:37,673
I gotta Puke.

2940
01:20:37,710 --> 01:20:37,951
No,

2941
01:20:37,951 --> 01:20:38,551
I'm not going to Puke.

2942
01:20:38,551 --> 01:20:39,930
I tried not to make myself puke.

2943
01:20:40,230 --> 01:20:41,130
Finally I get up,

2944
01:20:41,430 --> 01:20:42,570
ran to the bathroom south,

2945
01:20:42,610 --> 01:20:44,400
fell on the ground to Arenda bathroom,

2946
01:20:44,401 --> 01:20:45,450
puked my Puke,

2947
01:20:45,451 --> 01:20:47,880
turn into what was beets
turned into this red,

2948
01:20:47,881 --> 01:20:48,690
furry,

2949
01:20:48,690 --> 01:20:51,780
a tree that came out and was
just shooting lasers and stuff.

2950
01:20:51,930 --> 01:20:56,130
And so I started recording myself trying
to find my phone and I couldn't even

2951
01:20:56,131 --> 01:20:56,881
use my phone.

2952
01:20:56,881 --> 01:21:00,660
So like it took me maybe a half hour to
find out how to use my phone because the

2953
01:21:00,661 --> 01:21:02,640
phone was just a big kaleidoscope of Shit,

2954
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:03,833
you know?

2955
01:21:03,870 --> 01:21:06,180
And then suddenly it all
stopped and I was like,

2956
01:21:06,181 --> 01:21:07,080
what the fuck was that?

2957
01:21:07,081 --> 01:21:07,914
I feel normal.

2958
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:09,120
I don't see anything and everything.

2959
01:21:09,150 --> 01:21:12,450
And so it just immediately
right back into the world.

2960
01:21:12,720 --> 01:21:13,553
And it was,

2961
01:21:13,950 --> 01:21:14,550
it was,

2962
01:21:14,550 --> 01:21:15,780
I swear to God,

2963
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:17,550
I thought I had a poison.

2964
01:21:17,670 --> 01:21:18,960
I thought I had died.

2965
01:21:19,080 --> 01:21:20,460
I had no idea what's going on.

2966
01:21:20,520 --> 01:21:23,900
But girlfriend was laying in bed
just seeing all the same shit,

2967
01:21:23,920 --> 01:21:24,810
not feeling she was diags.

2968
01:21:24,820 --> 01:21:26,070
You only had half of what I had.

2969
01:21:26,190 --> 01:21:27,480
She wasn't puking or anything,

2970
01:21:27,630 --> 01:21:28,230
but I was,

2971
01:21:28,230 --> 01:21:29,430
I couldn't stop puking.

2972
01:21:29,620 --> 01:21:30,510
It was just,

2973
01:21:30,620 --> 01:21:31,530
I had nothing in me.

2974
01:21:31,531 --> 01:21:34,100
I don't even know what I was
puking and I thought I fucking,

2975
01:21:34,410 --> 01:21:34,620
no,

2976
01:21:34,620 --> 01:21:35,261
it's fascinating.

2977
01:21:35,261 --> 01:21:37,530
And you talk about the big ones
because I've never had big ones.

2978
01:21:37,531 --> 01:21:38,870
I've only had like little ones too.

2979
01:21:39,240 --> 01:21:41,130
But Dennis and Terence Mckenna,

2980
01:21:41,340 --> 01:21:46,340
when they were in the Amazon in like the
1970s this is when they started having

2981
01:21:48,001 --> 01:21:51,780
their psychedelic adventures and they
would go take the Iowasca and eat the

2982
01:21:51,781 --> 01:21:52,530
mushrooms.

2983
01:21:52,530 --> 01:21:54,600
They said the mushrooms
are like dinner plates,

2984
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:55,830
like in the Amazon.

2985
01:21:55,831 --> 01:21:57,390
These motherfuckers grow and they're like,

2986
01:21:57,530 --> 01:21:57,930
you know,

2987
01:21:57,930 --> 01:22:00,480
if you grow into a real
fertile environment like that,

2988
01:22:00,481 --> 01:22:02,550
that's one of the reasons
why look at the size of that.

2989
01:22:02,551 --> 01:22:03,384
Holy Shit.

2990
01:22:03,510 --> 01:22:05,190
Brian's holding one up a picture.

2991
01:22:05,191 --> 01:22:07,160
Once they do that looks like
a spaceship and then yeah,

2992
01:22:07,170 --> 01:22:08,003
look inside of it.

2993
01:22:08,320 --> 01:22:10,600
Then on it looks like a fucking like,

2994
01:22:10,630 --> 01:22:11,031
I don't know,

2995
01:22:11,031 --> 01:22:14,180
like a whale or sperm or an idea

2996
01:22:14,250 --> 01:22:14,581
ball.

2997
01:22:14,581 --> 01:22:17,400
It only makes sense that those
big ones would be even stronger.

2998
01:22:17,401 --> 01:22:18,510
Like what if they're stronger?

2999
01:22:18,511 --> 01:22:19,890
Poor ounce as well.

3000
01:22:20,670 --> 01:22:21,970
But then when I was going to say is dance,

3001
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:25,020
Dennis Mckenna went
crazy for like two weeks.

3002
01:22:25,140 --> 01:22:27,450
He had some sort of a
schizophrenia episode from,

3003
01:22:27,510 --> 01:22:31,500
from the mushrooms and lost his marbles
and it was like gone for two weeks.

3004
01:22:31,501 --> 01:22:33,060
They don't know what happened or what.

3005
01:22:33,210 --> 01:22:34,470
They don't know exactly what you mean.

3006
01:22:34,471 --> 01:22:35,790
He eventually came back,

3007
01:22:36,030 --> 01:22:38,880
but he was apparently just
gone for like the longest time.

3008
01:22:39,060 --> 01:22:40,020
That's some scary shit.

3009
01:22:40,270 --> 01:22:41,290
That was scary.

3010
01:22:41,320 --> 01:22:46,320
It was four hours of being inside of a
Salvia or a DMT trip and not a bathroom,

3011
01:22:47,321 --> 01:22:50,590
which I thought where I was
at and my girlfriend sent out.

3012
01:22:50,591 --> 01:22:53,140
She would walk in and I
would be sitting like Buddha,

3013
01:22:53,200 --> 01:22:56,770
like legs cross facing the wall
like two inches from a wall.

3014
01:22:56,771 --> 01:23:01,120
Just staring at it with my eyes open
and that I would look at her and my eyes

3015
01:23:01,121 --> 01:23:05,530
would be cross side and then like I would
turn back towards the wall and says,

3016
01:23:05,740 --> 01:23:06,070
she's

3017
01:23:06,070 --> 01:23:06,280
like,

3018
01:23:06,280 --> 01:23:07,750
I didn't know what she's like,

3019
01:23:07,751 --> 01:23:08,710
I thought you were mad.

3020
01:23:08,770 --> 01:23:09,101
She's like,

3021
01:23:09,101 --> 01:23:11,560
you were just sitting there
facing a wall or something.

3022
01:23:13,030 --> 01:23:15,010
I have no idea what the
fuck that was about,

3023
01:23:15,011 --> 01:23:15,880
but you wouldn't.

3024
01:23:15,881 --> 01:23:18,130
You had what's called a
breakthrough experience.

3025
01:23:18,131 --> 01:23:20,080
You have with all those
psychedelic freaks.

3026
01:23:20,081 --> 01:23:21,580
All really want to see,

3027
01:23:21,820 --> 01:23:22,001
you know,

3028
01:23:22,001 --> 01:23:23,100
a lot of people will talk about,

3029
01:23:23,120 --> 01:23:24,280
they like to do mushrooms,

3030
01:23:24,281 --> 01:23:25,840
but they never really have done mushrooms.

3031
01:23:26,020 --> 01:23:28,570
You don't really do mushrooms
until you see what you saw.

3032
01:23:28,780 --> 01:23:30,910
What you did is have the
full blown experience.

3033
01:23:30,911 --> 01:23:35,200
And that's one of the reasons why people
talk about like why do you make such a

3034
01:23:35,201 --> 01:23:35,621
big deal?

3035
01:23:35,621 --> 01:23:36,340
They'll say to me like,

3036
01:23:36,340 --> 01:23:38,050
why do you make such a
big deal about mushrooms?

3037
01:23:38,051 --> 01:23:41,080
Why do you make big deal about
DMT or the psychedelic experience?

3038
01:23:41,081 --> 01:23:41,371
Why do you,

3039
01:23:41,371 --> 01:23:42,460
why do you make such a big deal out of it?

3040
01:23:42,460 --> 01:23:43,300
So infant tile,

3041
01:23:43,630 --> 01:23:43,901
well,

3042
01:23:43,901 --> 01:23:46,510
I make a big deal about it
because to me it is a big deal.

3043
01:23:46,810 --> 01:23:47,950
What I've experienced,

3044
01:23:48,100 --> 01:23:49,330
especially DMT,

3045
01:23:49,630 --> 01:23:51,370
it's like it's impossible.

3046
01:23:51,400 --> 01:23:56,400
It is impossible and it's impossibly
beautiful and it's impossibly wise.

3047
01:23:56,680 --> 01:23:57,790
And after it's over,

3048
01:23:57,940 --> 01:23:59,410
I feel like I'm a better person.

3049
01:23:59,470 --> 01:24:03,520
I feel like I learned something and I
come back better and nicer and improved

3050
01:24:03,521 --> 01:24:04,510
and more enlightened.

3051
01:24:04,660 --> 01:24:04,931
I mean,

3052
01:24:04,931 --> 01:24:06,130
it sounds ridiculous.

3053
01:24:06,131 --> 01:24:06,411
I'm,

3054
01:24:06,411 --> 01:24:07,300
I'm agreeing with you.

3055
01:24:07,301 --> 01:24:08,980
It sounds ridiculous here in my own voice,

3056
01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:09,971
but God damn,

3057
01:24:09,971 --> 01:24:10,990
that shit is important.

3058
01:24:11,200 --> 01:24:12,490
You know what you did,

3059
01:24:12,520 --> 01:24:12,761
you know,

3060
01:24:12,761 --> 01:24:15,970
you didn't know exactly how much to take
and what if there was a sham and what

3061
01:24:15,971 --> 01:24:18,340
if there was a center where you
could go to and there's some fucking,

3062
01:24:18,420 --> 01:24:19,000
you know,

3063
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,790
place in Malibu and there's some fucking
people that have been doing it forever.

3064
01:24:21,940 --> 01:24:23,350
And Joey Diaz greets you at the door,

3065
01:24:23,380 --> 01:24:24,220
come on and got soccer.

3066
01:24:24,230 --> 01:24:24,750
We've got a room,

3067
01:24:24,750 --> 01:24:25,330
Voya,

3068
01:24:25,330 --> 01:24:28,060
he's got his robot and he takes you
to the place and everybody does it

3069
01:24:28,061 --> 01:24:28,870
correctly.

3070
01:24:28,870 --> 01:24:30,880
You know what a beautiful
world we could live in,

3071
01:24:30,881 --> 01:24:31,180
man.

3072
01:24:31,180 --> 01:24:32,110
I'll tell you what I,

3073
01:24:32,250 --> 01:24:35,800
I started fucking with that shit when I
was younger and that was from the east

3074
01:24:35,801 --> 01:24:36,100
coast.

3075
01:24:36,100 --> 01:24:37,250
There was no fucking mushrooms.

3076
01:24:37,780 --> 01:24:38,860
But I had these scientists,

3077
01:24:38,861 --> 01:24:41,490
kids that were like 30 when
I was like 15 and they,

3078
01:24:41,550 --> 01:24:45,330
they were scientists that he's Strausberg
and every week they were into all this

3079
01:24:45,331 --> 01:24:48,880
psychedelic and Syd
Barrett and all this shit.

3080
01:24:49,360 --> 01:24:50,290
And it would make stuff.

3081
01:24:50,291 --> 01:24:51,190
And I gotta be honest with you,

3082
01:24:51,191 --> 01:24:52,960
when I first started
fucking around with acid,

3083
01:24:53,440 --> 01:24:55,810
to me it was just another
way of getting fucked up,

3084
01:24:55,870 --> 01:24:56,703
killing the pain.

3085
01:24:57,150 --> 01:25:00,850
Because I started doing acid before my
mom died and I started triple like I

3086
01:25:00,851 --> 01:25:04,690
remember the trip and could well people
don't know is you found your mom dad was

3087
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:07,000
dad and I was on the way down.

3088
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:10,870
But what's really fucked up
was that that was just amazing.

3089
01:25:10,871 --> 01:25:11,740
But you know,

3090
01:25:11,741 --> 01:25:14,230
I started doing acid for the
same reasons that everybody else.

3091
01:25:14,350 --> 01:25:19,350
I didn't even learn about hallucinogenics
and the alt button until you use

3092
01:25:19,811 --> 01:25:20,644
later.

3093
01:25:20,650 --> 01:25:22,500
Like when I did window
pane in the eighth grade,

3094
01:25:22,520 --> 01:25:24,130
I went to see the stones.

3095
01:25:24,430 --> 01:25:25,410
I was mind boggling.

3096
01:25:25,450 --> 01:25:26,890
What do you mean by the alt button?

3097
01:25:26,920 --> 01:25:27,460
You know,

3098
01:25:27,460 --> 01:25:28,450
you made a very,

3099
01:25:28,451 --> 01:25:30,130
you made one of the best ever,

3100
01:25:30,260 --> 01:25:31,270
uh,

3101
01:25:31,420 --> 01:25:32,253
correlations.

3102
01:25:32,500 --> 01:25:35,620
He said that doing DMT is like
pressing the alt and delete,

3103
01:25:36,250 --> 01:25:36,641
control,

3104
01:25:36,641 --> 01:25:36,820
alt,

3105
01:25:36,820 --> 01:25:37,480
delete,

3106
01:25:37,480 --> 01:25:37,811
control,

3107
01:25:37,811 --> 01:25:37,991
alt,

3108
01:25:37,991 --> 01:25:38,350
delete.

3109
01:25:38,350 --> 01:25:39,250
It's like rebooting.

3110
01:25:39,251 --> 01:25:40,300
It's like we blew the world.

3111
01:25:40,450 --> 01:25:43,810
And I remember being a kid and
not just doing it to be high.

3112
01:25:43,930 --> 01:25:46,710
And then after my mother died and you
know that you use when buying them,

3113
01:25:46,930 --> 01:25:47,741
even six months,

3114
01:25:47,741 --> 01:25:52,060
I started selling microdot acid and every
weekend pick up a different 500 hits

3115
01:25:52,061 --> 01:25:52,370
or something.

3116
01:25:52,370 --> 01:25:53,790
Dell a four way acid.

3117
01:25:54,160 --> 01:25:55,600
I pick up and these guys were great.

3118
01:25:55,601 --> 01:25:56,440
That's what they did.

3119
01:25:56,470 --> 01:25:57,303
They trip,

3120
01:25:57,310 --> 01:25:58,450
they tripped the right way.

3121
01:25:58,480 --> 01:25:59,140
They would,

3122
01:25:59,140 --> 01:26:02,610
they would take sheets for a
weekend and go camping and you know,

3123
01:26:02,620 --> 01:26:03,980
I would be petrified of the staying

3124
01:26:03,980 --> 01:26:06,050
out in the fucking louvers for three days.

3125
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:06,471
That one,

3126
01:26:06,471 --> 01:26:09,020
they listen to led Zeppelin
and I mean it was crazy,

3127
01:26:09,021 --> 01:26:10,520
but that way eggs in campfire,

3128
01:26:10,820 --> 01:26:12,290
they would fucking cook and trip.

3129
01:26:12,470 --> 01:26:13,071
That wasn't me.

3130
01:26:13,071 --> 01:26:14,660
Like they had no hundred hits.

3131
01:26:14,661 --> 01:26:15,590
One time for him.

3132
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:19,610
Took him in four days and the camping
trip and they had the pictures and it was

3133
01:26:19,611 --> 01:26:20,121
just great.

3134
01:26:20,121 --> 01:26:20,901
But it wasn't for me.

3135
01:26:20,901 --> 01:26:21,734
I wasn't ready.

3136
01:26:21,980 --> 01:26:23,270
But then after my mom died,

3137
01:26:23,271 --> 01:26:25,370
I'd go into these a psychosis.

3138
01:26:25,371 --> 01:26:25,761
He's like,

3139
01:26:25,761 --> 01:26:28,580
I couldn't figure out why an uncle
wouldn't talk to me or something.

3140
01:26:29,220 --> 01:26:30,500
And that night on the way home,

3141
01:26:30,501 --> 01:26:32,180
I knew that my uncle,

3142
01:26:32,190 --> 01:26:33,490
me always at war when I was like,

3143
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:34,610
I'm just making an example.

3144
01:26:34,611 --> 01:26:35,421
There was just a problem.

3145
01:26:35,421 --> 01:26:39,680
Maybe a girl didn't like me or you
know what killed my mother always had a

3146
01:26:39,681 --> 01:26:40,490
dilemma in my head.

3147
01:26:40,490 --> 01:26:40,820
When you're,

3148
01:26:40,820 --> 01:26:42,770
when you're 16 you always
want to know answers.

3149
01:26:43,190 --> 01:26:46,700
And I remember I would take a hit
of acid and go home and you know,

3150
01:26:46,730 --> 01:26:51,730
fucking come tripping like one had been
a junior in high school or sophomore,

3151
01:26:52,010 --> 01:26:53,810
but I knew if I trip on myself,

3152
01:26:53,811 --> 01:26:57,530
that's when I got the full effect and
have to go home and take a fucking,

3153
01:26:57,760 --> 01:27:02,480
he had a window pane or fall away acid
and I get speakers and I listened to like

3154
01:27:02,481 --> 01:27:05,390
black sabbath sabotage or master reality,

3155
01:27:05,391 --> 01:27:07,430
which just blows you out
of the fucking water.

3156
01:27:07,980 --> 01:27:08,430
And I would,

3157
01:27:08,430 --> 01:27:09,410
and at the end of the night,

3158
01:27:09,411 --> 01:27:10,141
whatever prom,

3159
01:27:10,141 --> 01:27:12,670
my hat or whatever inner
problem I was thinking about,

3160
01:27:12,730 --> 01:27:13,730
that was really in a way,

3161
01:27:13,731 --> 01:27:16,130
I mean it'd be gone or solved.

3162
01:27:16,850 --> 01:27:18,710
It sued over right?

3163
01:27:18,860 --> 01:27:19,460
It was Susie.

3164
01:27:19,460 --> 01:27:19,791
Oh yeah,

3165
01:27:19,791 --> 01:27:20,091
yeah.

3166
01:27:20,091 --> 01:27:21,880
At least now I knew where I stood.

3167
01:27:21,920 --> 01:27:24,230
Don't you think that's why
I want so many problem kids,

3168
01:27:24,231 --> 01:27:25,910
so many troubled kids have this deep,

3169
01:27:25,911 --> 01:27:27,410
deep connection to music,

3170
01:27:27,770 --> 01:27:28,160
you know?

3171
01:27:28,160 --> 01:27:28,371
I mean,

3172
01:27:28,371 --> 01:27:30,710
how many kids do you see
that are just all fucked up?

3173
01:27:30,711 --> 01:27:31,700
And they got long,

3174
01:27:31,701 --> 01:27:32,930
crazy greasy hair,

3175
01:27:32,931 --> 01:27:35,480
but they got a shirt on
if their favorite band,

3176
01:27:35,481 --> 01:27:39,980
they're headed to that concert and their
fucking life depends on this show being

3177
01:27:39,981 --> 01:27:40,550
good.

3178
01:27:40,550 --> 01:27:41,320
You know what I mean?

3179
01:27:41,320 --> 01:27:41,481
I mean,

3180
01:27:41,481 --> 01:27:45,020
you're talking about like some really
fucking dark and depressed people,

3181
01:27:45,200 --> 01:27:47,630
but they loved their music man.

3182
01:27:47,631 --> 01:27:48,231
Very funny.

3183
01:27:48,231 --> 01:27:49,460
When we were in Philadelphia,

3184
01:27:49,520 --> 01:27:52,480
a kid I hadn't been at the
bitter end came up to me.

3185
01:27:52,510 --> 01:27:53,680
What's the bitter end had been around?

3186
01:27:53,681 --> 01:27:54,411
It was a rock club.

3187
01:27:54,411 --> 01:27:55,244
I did a rock club.

3188
01:27:55,820 --> 01:27:56,720
You did that in New York.

3189
01:27:56,721 --> 01:27:56,881
Right.

3190
01:27:56,881 --> 01:28:00,110
And if he came to my neighbor
and he brought me a joint and he,

3191
01:28:00,111 --> 01:28:00,500
uh,

3192
01:28:00,500 --> 01:28:01,311
he brought me to join.

3193
01:28:01,311 --> 01:28:02,121
He was very nice.

3194
01:28:02,121 --> 01:28:02,770
And then Phil,

3195
01:28:02,770 --> 01:28:03,770
he came with his other friend,

3196
01:28:03,771 --> 01:28:04,790
he drove from New York City.

3197
01:28:04,790 --> 01:28:07,940
They go like Nyu and he came
up to me and he said to me,

3198
01:28:07,941 --> 01:28:08,391
hey man,

3199
01:28:08,391 --> 01:28:09,620
I'm thinking of doing mushrooms,

3200
01:28:09,680 --> 01:28:10,040
ash,

3201
01:28:10,040 --> 01:28:10,873
which should I do?

3202
01:28:11,120 --> 01:28:13,000
And I want him to fucking
reach over and smack them.

3203
01:28:13,490 --> 01:28:13,791
You know,

3204
01:28:13,791 --> 01:28:14,630
in my mind I'm like,

3205
01:28:14,631 --> 01:28:14,811
Yo,

3206
01:28:14,811 --> 01:28:16,730
that loss that you want to ask me,

3207
01:28:16,731 --> 01:28:17,750
what the fuck to do?

3208
01:28:17,810 --> 01:28:17,961
Well,

3209
01:28:17,961 --> 01:28:18,591
if he's a yard,

3210
01:28:18,591 --> 01:28:19,050
hold on.

3211
01:28:19,050 --> 01:28:19,430
I was,

3212
01:28:19,430 --> 01:28:21,620
one of the story was 19 point okay,

3213
01:28:21,980 --> 01:28:24,950
so I fucking talked about
it and then I emailed them,

3214
01:28:24,951 --> 01:28:28,820
we emailed each other and I really
thought about it his age and stuff.

3215
01:28:28,821 --> 01:28:32,300
And then I thought about when
I was 16 and I had no answers.

3216
01:28:32,390 --> 01:28:33,320
I had no answers.

3217
01:28:33,470 --> 01:28:34,340
I had no mother,

3218
01:28:34,490 --> 01:28:35,181
no father,

3219
01:28:35,181 --> 01:28:37,580
no social security check and all that one.

3220
01:28:37,581 --> 01:28:38,151
It was answers.

3221
01:28:38,151 --> 01:28:40,970
All I wanted was help and
I remember that at all.

3222
01:28:40,971 --> 01:28:43,370
I would get my help was was
listening to black sabbath,

3223
01:28:43,410 --> 01:28:44,360
doing a hit of acid,

3224
01:28:44,780 --> 01:28:45,650
listened to music.

3225
01:28:45,650 --> 01:28:46,431
It always sued me.

3226
01:28:46,431 --> 01:28:47,600
I always thought I had a connection,

3227
01:28:47,601 --> 01:28:52,601
but I was he asthma when I was walking
the 30 years after the blizzard of Oz was

3228
01:28:52,791 --> 01:28:53,930
on VH one yesterday.

3229
01:28:53,931 --> 01:28:58,310
Tremendous about how he left Sabbath and
opens up this bandwidth is Randy Rhoads

3230
01:28:58,700 --> 01:28:59,481
and no songs.

3231
01:28:59,481 --> 01:29:00,051
But you know what?

3232
01:29:00,051 --> 01:29:01,440
They were dumb fucking songs.

3233
01:29:01,441 --> 01:29:02,274
Who gives a fuck?

3234
01:29:02,280 --> 01:29:02,820
Some of them,

3235
01:29:02,820 --> 01:29:06,270
but they made me go through
at that period of my life.

3236
01:29:06,660 --> 01:29:09,620
So what differences are making
when people watch this podcast,

3237
01:29:09,621 --> 01:29:10,920
who they listened to this podcast.

3238
01:29:11,430 --> 01:29:12,001
You know what,

3239
01:29:12,001 --> 01:29:12,211
man?

3240
01:29:12,211 --> 01:29:14,010
We feel the same void for some people.

3241
01:29:14,700 --> 01:29:15,620
And I'm telling you this,

3242
01:29:15,630 --> 01:29:16,441
I didn't know this.

3243
01:29:16,441 --> 01:29:18,810
I didn't know how responsible
you are when you do this.

3244
01:29:19,050 --> 01:29:22,170
When you talk and you say certain things
about your feelings and your emotions,

3245
01:29:22,410 --> 01:29:25,920
people jump onto you because they feel
your pain or their admiration or their

3246
01:29:25,921 --> 01:29:28,680
happiness and all the sudden you become
a part of them and they become a part of

3247
01:29:28,681 --> 01:29:30,480
the human because that's
what happened to me.

3248
01:29:30,480 --> 01:29:31,890
As stupid as this may sound,

3249
01:29:31,920 --> 01:29:32,753
you've known it.

3250
01:29:32,850 --> 01:29:33,870
You had martial arts,

3251
01:29:33,871 --> 01:29:35,160
your escape when you were a kid.

3252
01:29:35,400 --> 01:29:37,860
We all have to have some fuck
of escape when you're a kid,

3253
01:29:38,070 --> 01:29:40,950
especially when you don't come from
the fucking Brady bunch you're doing.

3254
01:29:41,010 --> 01:29:44,640
I think that one of the things that
helps people with this podcast too,

3255
01:29:44,641 --> 01:29:46,250
and I get a lot of emails and Twitter,

3256
01:29:46,251 --> 01:29:49,560
it's about it is you know there's a lot
of people that don't have anybody cool

3257
01:29:49,561 --> 01:29:50,220
to hang out with.

3258
01:29:50,220 --> 01:29:50,531
They,

3259
01:29:50,531 --> 01:29:51,930
they go and they're stuck.

3260
01:29:51,960 --> 01:29:53,070
They're stuck wherever the fuck.

3261
01:29:53,071 --> 01:29:55,620
They don't need to know that
there's people out there like this.

3262
01:29:55,790 --> 01:29:56,551
They need to know that.

3263
01:29:56,551 --> 01:29:58,560
They don't have to think the way
that everybody else is thinking.

3264
01:29:58,700 --> 01:30:00,090
You can think positive man.

3265
01:30:00,091 --> 01:30:01,140
You can be cool to people.

3266
01:30:01,290 --> 01:30:02,280
You can get the fuck out.

3267
01:30:02,520 --> 01:30:02,851
You know?

3268
01:30:02,851 --> 01:30:03,181
Don't,

3269
01:30:03,181 --> 01:30:04,500
don't blame the world.

3270
01:30:04,530 --> 01:30:05,220
Just get out.

3271
01:30:05,220 --> 01:30:07,530
I know when I was a matter how
you got started with Jersey,

3272
01:30:07,560 --> 01:30:09,870
I knew when I was 16 I was
leaving Jersey jump rope.

3273
01:30:09,990 --> 01:30:10,823
I didn't know that.

3274
01:30:11,010 --> 01:30:11,843
I know I had to go.

3275
01:30:11,850 --> 01:30:12,480
Absolutely.

3276
01:30:12,480 --> 01:30:14,370
I knew it because it wasn't for me.

3277
01:30:14,371 --> 01:30:15,690
I didn't want to fuck [inaudible].

3278
01:30:16,050 --> 01:30:17,760
I thought there was something in Colorado.

3279
01:30:17,761 --> 01:30:18,990
I thought the answer man.

3280
01:30:19,020 --> 01:30:20,010
I thought there was something.

3281
01:30:20,370 --> 01:30:21,480
I didn't know how to get there.

3282
01:30:21,570 --> 01:30:23,010
Don't even talk to me about Colorado.

3283
01:30:23,011 --> 01:30:23,410
I still want.

3284
01:30:23,410 --> 01:30:24,570
This is what this podcast is.

3285
01:30:24,571 --> 01:30:26,460
One of the things that
keep me around for real,

3286
01:30:26,790 --> 01:30:29,040
this podcast him since we came back,

3287
01:30:29,041 --> 01:30:30,210
that's when we started it.

3288
01:30:30,390 --> 01:30:33,900
I came back from Colorado in November
and Brian and I started this thing in

3289
01:30:33,901 --> 01:30:34,560
December.

3290
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:35,100
Boom.

3291
01:30:35,100 --> 01:30:36,810
Just like that and needed something to do.

3292
01:30:36,840 --> 01:30:37,081
I was,

3293
01:30:37,081 --> 01:30:37,740
I was sick.

3294
01:30:37,740 --> 01:30:38,161
I was sick.

3295
01:30:38,161 --> 01:30:41,490
I was living in the woods on a top of a
mountain and all of a sudden here I am

3296
01:30:41,491 --> 01:30:42,960
back in the fucking grind again.

3297
01:30:42,990 --> 01:30:45,030
I thought I escaped shit.

3298
01:30:45,360 --> 01:30:46,440
Talking about Colorado,

3299
01:30:46,450 --> 01:30:47,001
I got to give up.

3300
01:30:47,001 --> 01:30:48,350
I got to give a shout out to customers.

3301
01:30:48,460 --> 01:30:49,350
[inaudible] son.

3302
01:30:49,860 --> 01:30:51,210
When I first went to Colorado,

3303
01:30:51,211 --> 01:30:51,811
I had problems.

3304
01:30:51,811 --> 01:30:52,140
You know,

3305
01:30:52,140 --> 01:30:55,020
I was 1920 I just wanted
to live and I didn't know,

3306
01:30:55,021 --> 01:30:56,810
but I had a friend who was going to,

3307
01:30:56,880 --> 01:30:57,330
he was in the,

3308
01:30:57,330 --> 01:30:58,050
let's all go together.

3309
01:30:58,050 --> 01:30:58,940
He was in the [inaudible].

3310
01:30:59,060 --> 01:31:00,270
Where did you train for judo?

3311
01:31:00,720 --> 01:31:03,660
I just want to call and to
Colorado Springs Air Force.

3312
01:31:03,990 --> 01:31:04,400
He was in the,

3313
01:31:04,400 --> 01:31:05,050
I didn't actually,

3314
01:31:05,050 --> 01:31:05,290
well,

3315
01:31:05,290 --> 01:31:06,440
I train the train.

3316
01:31:06,640 --> 01:31:08,790
I went up there to watch the World Cup.

3317
01:31:09,030 --> 01:31:09,370
Okay.

3318
01:31:09,370 --> 01:31:11,310
I got a chance to work
out why I was up there.

3319
01:31:11,330 --> 01:31:14,220
So I technically trained at
the Olympic training center,

3320
01:31:14,400 --> 01:31:15,960
but I didn't like train with the team.

3321
01:31:16,020 --> 01:31:16,890
I just was up there.

3322
01:31:16,920 --> 01:31:18,750
So he was inspirational.

3323
01:31:18,910 --> 01:31:22,410
He had gone to school there and got
thrown out and then he was living in Aspen

3324
01:31:23,100 --> 01:31:23,881
and he talked me,

3325
01:31:23,881 --> 01:31:24,121
he's like,

3326
01:31:24,121 --> 01:31:24,521
go out there.

3327
01:31:24,521 --> 01:31:25,950
They shoveled snow and I didn't know.

3328
01:31:26,190 --> 01:31:29,550
So one day I go out and talk to my Stepdad
and I see this like distant cousin of

3329
01:31:29,551 --> 01:31:30,360
mine.

3330
01:31:30,360 --> 01:31:33,130
He's like cousins through
marriage and he's telling me,

3331
01:31:33,200 --> 01:31:33,820
I'm thought,

3332
01:31:33,820 --> 01:31:34,171
he was like,

3333
01:31:34,171 --> 01:31:34,921
what are you gonna do with your life?

3334
01:31:34,921 --> 01:31:35,910
And I'm thinking of going to Colorado.

3335
01:31:35,911 --> 01:31:36,121
He's like,

3336
01:31:36,121 --> 01:31:37,430
Colorado is the place to be.

3337
01:31:37,431 --> 01:31:38,940
I got a house in Aspen and shit.

3338
01:31:41,280 --> 01:31:43,130
What the fuck did you get
money to live in Aspen?

3339
01:31:43,440 --> 01:31:45,480
Cuba's dude who plays congress in a band.

3340
01:31:46,080 --> 01:31:46,411
He's like,

3341
01:31:46,411 --> 01:31:46,760
yeah,

3342
01:31:46,760 --> 01:31:49,110
I've got a house and has
been next to Nicholson Bitch.

3343
01:31:49,500 --> 01:31:49,951
And I'm like,

3344
01:31:49,951 --> 01:31:50,784
stop it.

3345
01:31:52,070 --> 01:31:53,970
I'm going to look your shit up dog.

3346
01:31:53,971 --> 01:31:55,070
Don't fuck know me.

3347
01:31:55,080 --> 01:31:55,800
I'll show up.

3348
01:31:55,800 --> 01:31:57,000
Right dog.

3349
01:31:57,030 --> 01:31:58,080
I get to Colorado.

3350
01:31:58,081 --> 01:31:58,801
I ask around,

3351
01:31:58,801 --> 01:31:59,020
I go,

3352
01:31:59,020 --> 01:31:59,261
listen,

3353
01:31:59,261 --> 01:32:01,450
I gotta get up to ask me
to go to this borough.

3354
01:32:02,020 --> 01:32:03,100
This is pre cell phones.

3355
01:32:03,101 --> 01:32:03,934
By the way,

3356
01:32:04,160 --> 01:32:05,500
here's this hitchhiking up there.

3357
01:32:05,530 --> 01:32:05,701
No,

3358
01:32:05,701 --> 01:32:05,780
no,

3359
01:32:05,780 --> 01:32:05,920
no.

3360
01:32:05,920 --> 01:32:06,131
Yeah,

3361
01:32:06,131 --> 01:32:06,970
this is one you just hit.

3362
01:32:06,971 --> 01:32:08,590
So you can take the bus from basalt path.

3363
01:32:08,591 --> 01:32:11,110
Did you hitch or did you take it back
in those days there was a hitching post

3364
01:32:11,111 --> 01:32:13,360
and Aspen and besought
brought the hitching policy.

3365
01:32:13,390 --> 01:32:16,060
I'm more stories about you cause
there was a hitching post and aspirin.

3366
01:32:16,090 --> 01:32:17,320
Didn't you get picked up?

3367
01:32:17,320 --> 01:32:18,280
I one of the eagles.

3368
01:32:18,310 --> 01:32:19,001
Fuck yeah.

3369
01:32:19,001 --> 01:32:21,130
Darn motherfucking Henley and a half.

3370
01:32:21,870 --> 01:32:23,660
And I got picked up on the bottom,

3371
01:32:23,661 --> 01:32:27,430
must snow mass by John Denver on
the bottom going up for 4th of July.

3372
01:32:27,431 --> 01:32:28,264
And we just talked,

3373
01:32:28,270 --> 01:32:29,440
he picked me up in a brown jeep.

3374
01:32:29,441 --> 01:32:29,711
My mother,

3375
01:32:29,711 --> 01:32:31,000
when they had the eagles and on the front,

3376
01:32:31,190 --> 01:32:33,430
I remember the old school that
James used to have the eagles.

3377
01:32:33,850 --> 01:32:34,580
He had an ego.

3378
01:32:34,580 --> 01:32:35,680
Colorado is the bomb.

3379
01:32:35,710 --> 01:32:39,250
Don Henley seems like mother picked me
up in the truck and they kept saying,

3380
01:32:39,251 --> 01:32:39,640
dog,

3381
01:32:39,640 --> 01:32:40,740
I fucking know you.

3382
01:32:41,360 --> 01:32:42,161
And he can say,

3383
01:32:42,161 --> 01:32:43,120
no you don't.

3384
01:32:43,370 --> 01:32:46,240
And then he was recommending me for
something or something like he was like,

3385
01:32:46,241 --> 01:32:47,590
I'll tell you where the restaurant is.

3386
01:32:47,920 --> 01:32:50,830
And he moved shit over and he
had a checkbook and I said,

3387
01:32:50,831 --> 01:32:52,260
Don Henley construction company.

3388
01:32:52,270 --> 01:32:56,530
Well motherfucker [inaudible] his
big song was done at that time.

3389
01:32:56,531 --> 01:32:57,364
It was uh,

3390
01:32:58,030 --> 01:33:01,120
it was the first single out that
he put on the dirty laundry.

3391
01:33:01,360 --> 01:33:02,560
That's how long ago that was.

3392
01:33:02,561 --> 01:33:04,450
That was fucking dirty
laundry motherfucker.

3393
01:33:04,690 --> 01:33:05,650
Holy Shit.

3394
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:06,970
Did you have to suck his dick?

3395
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:07,560
No,

3396
01:33:07,560 --> 01:33:08,620
he was very nice.

3397
01:33:08,621 --> 01:33:09,270
Very,

3398
01:33:09,270 --> 01:33:10,410
I had never hitchhiked.

3399
01:33:10,450 --> 01:33:11,710
I could never do that shit.

3400
01:33:11,860 --> 01:33:12,693
They

3401
01:33:13,920 --> 01:33:14,280
listen,

3402
01:33:14,280 --> 01:33:15,340
this is aspen,

3403
01:33:15,341 --> 01:33:19,090
Colorado guys circa 1983.

3404
01:33:19,330 --> 01:33:21,040
They didn't even have
cable television then.

3405
01:33:21,300 --> 01:33:22,750
We ain't nothing but white people.

3406
01:33:22,751 --> 01:33:26,470
He will tell the leader up there at the
time they had one channel channel too

3407
01:33:26,620 --> 01:33:29,440
and all they did was play Charles
Bronson movies cause he lived up there.

3408
01:33:29,441 --> 01:33:31,930
They would play Mr Majestic
and something else to the end.

3409
01:33:32,230 --> 01:33:36,780
I loved it and it was just
so I was telling you about
this dude tweety his name

3410
01:33:36,781 --> 01:33:39,010
was tweeting while I was
growing up and he's like,

3411
01:33:39,011 --> 01:33:40,660
dog look me up when you go out there.

3412
01:33:40,661 --> 01:33:41,660
I get the basalt,

3413
01:33:42,280 --> 01:33:42,701
boom.

3414
01:33:42,701 --> 01:33:43,421
I got a ride up.

3415
01:33:43,421 --> 01:33:44,980
The fucking maroon bells.

3416
01:33:45,250 --> 01:33:46,360
When I'm in Maroon Bells,

3417
01:33:46,361 --> 01:33:46,901
I walk,

3418
01:33:46,901 --> 01:33:47,441
I walk,

3419
01:33:47,441 --> 01:33:47,891
I walk,

3420
01:33:47,891 --> 01:33:48,940
it's fucking far.

3421
01:33:49,480 --> 01:33:50,500
I get to his house,

3422
01:33:50,501 --> 01:33:52,000
he's got a gorgeous house.

3423
01:33:52,390 --> 01:33:54,670
There's a fucking
Mercedes in the driveway.

3424
01:33:55,060 --> 01:33:56,890
I rang the bell is tweety here?

3425
01:33:56,891 --> 01:33:57,400
Who?

3426
01:33:57,400 --> 01:33:57,820
Tweedy?

3427
01:33:57,820 --> 01:33:59,510
Oh you're talking about a and hold on.

3428
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:02,440
Robert comes out with a robe and
he invites me in and he's like,

3429
01:34:02,441 --> 01:34:03,460
come on nose money.

3430
01:34:04,120 --> 01:34:04,953
Listen,

3431
01:34:05,200 --> 01:34:06,520
I don't ask no questions.

3432
01:34:06,521 --> 01:34:06,971
You know me.

3433
01:34:06,971 --> 01:34:07,600
I'm an AI.

3434
01:34:07,600 --> 01:34:09,070
And those days I didn't
ask him a question.

3435
01:34:09,340 --> 01:34:14,050
I had gone to his wedding when he married
into my distance type of Cuban family.

3436
01:34:14,650 --> 01:34:16,210
So he has this house.

3437
01:34:16,600 --> 01:34:19,780
So we're there and also that would go
up there like once a weekend and party

3438
01:34:19,781 --> 01:34:20,051
with them,

3439
01:34:20,051 --> 01:34:20,651
my party.

3440
01:34:20,651 --> 01:34:24,340
But like a cook and we talk about
human shit and one day he's like,

3441
01:34:24,341 --> 01:34:25,174
come here for a second,

3442
01:34:25,390 --> 01:34:25,971
look down there.

3443
01:34:25,971 --> 01:34:27,290
Look who sunbathing down there.

3444
01:34:27,610 --> 01:34:28,443
Sure enough bench.

3445
01:34:28,490 --> 01:34:30,970
It was Jack Nicholson with
three little fucking blind hose.

3446
01:34:30,970 --> 01:34:32,200
I was a kid from New York.

3447
01:34:32,201 --> 01:34:34,510
Sound like Aspen and act.

3448
01:34:34,560 --> 01:34:35,760
This is maroon bells.

3449
01:34:35,770 --> 01:34:38,380
This is one of the
prettiest spot in the world.

3450
01:34:38,410 --> 01:34:39,490
They say Maroon Bells,

3451
01:34:39,491 --> 01:34:40,324
Colorado.

3452
01:34:40,450 --> 01:34:41,970
It's just fucking Boise.

3453
01:34:42,010 --> 01:34:45,430
Jack Nicholson last talk
killed it before CMC.

3454
01:34:45,480 --> 01:34:50,480
This is 80 fucking three
had three Batman and shit.

3455
01:34:51,580 --> 01:34:52,413
Stop it.

3456
01:34:52,450 --> 01:34:54,070
Is this some pre,

3457
01:34:54,220 --> 01:34:55,190
this is pre Batman.

3458
01:34:55,210 --> 01:34:56,920
Is this pre that the fucking,

3459
01:34:57,230 --> 01:34:57,441
yeah,

3460
01:34:57,441 --> 01:34:58,274
but not Batman.

3461
01:34:58,760 --> 01:35:01,460
Who's the crazy movie in Colorado?

3462
01:35:02,240 --> 01:35:02,721
What movie?

3463
01:35:02,721 --> 01:35:03,610
What the fuck is it called?

3464
01:35:03,611 --> 01:35:04,360
All over the Cuckoo's nest?

3465
01:35:04,360 --> 01:35:04,671
No,

3466
01:35:04,671 --> 01:35:04,881
no.

3467
01:35:04,881 --> 01:35:05,870
The one that horror movie.

3468
01:35:05,871 --> 01:35:08,000
The Stephen King of all the shining.

3469
01:35:08,070 --> 01:35:08,903
The shining,

3470
01:35:09,170 --> 01:35:09,500
shining.

3471
01:35:09,500 --> 01:35:11,120
I think it was after the show.

3472
01:35:11,690 --> 01:35:12,710
This is after each visit.

3473
01:35:12,711 --> 01:35:15,650
Why he fell in love with Colorado
mountains and they pay you up.

3474
01:35:15,651 --> 01:35:16,041
There you lay,

3475
01:35:16,041 --> 01:35:16,874
I can live here.

3476
01:35:17,660 --> 01:35:19,160
So fucking I kept visiting him.

3477
01:35:19,170 --> 01:35:19,910
He would say to me,

3478
01:35:19,910 --> 01:35:20,211
dog,

3479
01:35:20,211 --> 01:35:21,410
meet me up at Galena Street,

3480
01:35:21,420 --> 01:35:22,041
Galina streets.

3481
01:35:22,041 --> 01:35:23,150
The biggest treat NASPA.

3482
01:35:23,510 --> 01:35:24,021
I grew up there,

3483
01:35:24,021 --> 01:35:26,090
he had a store named Far East treasures.

3484
01:35:26,560 --> 01:35:27,800
They had one carpet in it.

3485
01:35:30,080 --> 01:35:30,861
I swear to God,

3486
01:35:30,861 --> 01:35:32,810
every time I go to have one
fucking carpet in there.

3487
01:35:32,870 --> 01:35:33,760
Oh my God,

3488
01:35:33,770 --> 01:35:35,030
what fucking carpet of this.

3489
01:35:35,031 --> 01:35:37,040
So to make a long story short,

3490
01:35:37,160 --> 01:35:38,600
he would come and pick me up and bizarre.

3491
01:35:38,630 --> 01:35:40,100
He was more like distant cousins.

3492
01:35:40,280 --> 01:35:41,091
We became friends.

3493
01:35:41,091 --> 01:35:42,710
I introduced them to my friends and shit.

3494
01:35:43,010 --> 01:35:43,641
So one day,

3495
01:35:43,641 --> 01:35:44,474
one fucking,

3496
01:35:44,490 --> 01:35:44,870
well,

3497
01:35:44,870 --> 01:35:46,610
I'm living in Snowmass now.

3498
01:35:46,611 --> 01:35:50,630
This is like four months later and I
hadn't seen tweet and like two months and

3499
01:35:50,631 --> 01:35:51,730
all of a sudden my bag of the call,

3500
01:35:51,750 --> 01:35:53,180
they're like dog dog,

3501
01:35:53,360 --> 01:35:54,290
put on cs,

3502
01:35:54,291 --> 01:35:55,820
whatever to it was dead.

3503
01:35:55,821 --> 01:35:56,451
Two channels,

3504
01:35:56,451 --> 01:35:57,284
don't ask me,

3505
01:35:57,440 --> 01:35:58,070
I think,

3506
01:35:58,070 --> 01:35:59,270
I don't want to insult your dog,

3507
01:35:59,271 --> 01:36:01,820
but there's been some problems
and you've got to see,

3508
01:36:01,821 --> 01:36:03,770
I think this is the dude
that says he's your cousin.

3509
01:36:03,771 --> 01:36:03,951
I'm like,

3510
01:36:03,951 --> 01:36:04,784
what are you talking about?

3511
01:36:04,790 --> 01:36:06,560
That dude that lives in maroon bells.

3512
01:36:06,560 --> 01:36:07,550
You got to see this shit.

3513
01:36:07,940 --> 01:36:11,350
So that's when I pull on the fucking TV
and they go back to what happened today

3514
01:36:11,351 --> 01:36:11,811
and Aspen,

3515
01:36:11,811 --> 01:36:12,644
Colorado,

3516
01:36:12,710 --> 01:36:15,500
a DEA and caught with a guy.

3517
01:36:15,501 --> 01:36:19,430
In the end they show this airplane and
they show a DEA plane behind them and

3518
01:36:19,431 --> 01:36:22,340
they show bales of cocaine
going get thrown out

3519
01:36:25,280 --> 01:36:27,020
and they show this guy and I'm like,

3520
01:36:27,140 --> 01:36:28,640
oh fucking tweeny.

3521
01:36:28,960 --> 01:36:31,910
So to tweedy was a DEA
agent or PT will tweet.

3522
01:36:31,911 --> 01:36:32,744
He was a dealer.

3523
01:36:32,880 --> 01:36:33,350
Okay.

3524
01:36:33,350 --> 01:36:35,390
Sba chasten him on the plane.

3525
01:36:35,630 --> 01:36:36,680
He's on the fucking plane.

3526
01:36:36,681 --> 01:36:37,371
Wave in this shit.

3527
01:36:37,371 --> 01:36:40,640
Throwing up gang signals was
out of the fucking plane.

3528
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:41,751
I see this.

3529
01:36:41,751 --> 01:36:42,171
I kept,

3530
01:36:42,171 --> 01:36:43,370
my head's about to explode.

3531
01:36:43,400 --> 01:36:44,121
Oh my God,

3532
01:36:44,121 --> 01:36:44,871
my stepfather,

3533
01:36:44,871 --> 01:36:45,141
he's like,

3534
01:36:45,141 --> 01:36:45,711
you didn't fuck it.

3535
01:36:45,711 --> 01:36:46,071
And all that.

3536
01:36:46,071 --> 01:36:46,970
I used to big time,

3537
01:36:46,971 --> 01:36:47,261
I'm like,

3538
01:36:47,261 --> 01:36:48,094
come on.

3539
01:36:48,200 --> 01:36:48,771
And I'm like,

3540
01:36:48,771 --> 01:36:49,041
Bro,

3541
01:36:49,041 --> 01:36:50,300
he lives next to Nicholson.

3542
01:36:50,300 --> 01:36:51,260
He must be doing something.

3543
01:36:51,620 --> 01:36:52,341
So I go home.

3544
01:36:52,341 --> 01:36:53,660
I'd never seen tweedy again.

3545
01:36:53,990 --> 01:36:56,230
Thursday night I go to
flap was with my boy,

3546
01:36:56,240 --> 01:36:57,270
talked about on stage.

3547
01:36:57,271 --> 01:36:57,891
So Matt side,

3548
01:36:57,891 --> 01:36:58,840
these two guys coming to me,

3549
01:36:59,200 --> 01:37:00,021
you want to smoke a bong?

3550
01:37:00,021 --> 01:37:00,351
Let's go.

3551
01:37:00,351 --> 01:37:01,250
We walked across the street,

3552
01:37:01,460 --> 01:37:02,190
started smoking it,

3553
01:37:02,190 --> 01:37:02,411
bond.

3554
01:37:02,411 --> 01:37:02,680
They're like,

3555
01:37:02,680 --> 01:37:02,841
oh,

3556
01:37:02,841 --> 01:37:07,660
you must know her uncle tweety
I grew up with too greedy,

3557
01:37:07,670 --> 01:37:08,031
always,

3558
01:37:08,031 --> 01:37:08,781
whatever it says.

3559
01:37:08,781 --> 01:37:09,411
If we knew you,

3560
01:37:09,411 --> 01:37:12,110
I got dog tweenies out of jail thinking,

3561
01:37:12,111 --> 01:37:12,811
well he just guy.

3562
01:37:12,811 --> 01:37:14,300
He just 17 fucking years,

3563
01:37:15,020 --> 01:37:17,390
17 years for trafficking.

3564
01:37:18,320 --> 01:37:18,960
Wow.

3565
01:37:18,960 --> 01:37:19,540
Mom,

3566
01:37:19,540 --> 01:37:21,450
did they get all his money or they too,

3567
01:37:21,520 --> 01:37:22,790
he's working in a supermarket.

3568
01:37:22,850 --> 01:37:23,600
It's a tragic,

3569
01:37:23,600 --> 01:37:23,871
you know,

3570
01:37:23,871 --> 01:37:24,770
it's the American dream.

3571
01:37:24,780 --> 01:37:25,613
Dove.

3572
01:37:25,690 --> 01:37:26,523
Wow.

3573
01:37:28,130 --> 01:37:31,690
Someone needs to find that dude and get
a fucking Martin Scorsese script written

3574
01:37:31,700 --> 01:37:32,710
and when you're fuck,

3575
01:37:32,711 --> 01:37:33,544
you know what I'm saying?

3576
01:37:33,620 --> 01:37:34,610
But that they shit,

3577
01:37:34,611 --> 01:37:35,930
they played that video.

3578
01:37:36,020 --> 01:37:36,561
It became,

3579
01:37:36,561 --> 01:37:37,221
in those days,

3580
01:37:37,221 --> 01:37:38,180
there was no web page.

3581
01:37:38,450 --> 01:37:41,000
It became a viral television thing.

3582
01:37:41,390 --> 01:37:45,320
Like the war on drugs continues
to look at this video from Aspen.

3583
01:37:45,400 --> 01:37:49,310
So he was throwing it out of them and
playing around on the fucking plane and

3584
01:37:49,311 --> 01:37:50,960
they were being chased me and chased.

3585
01:37:51,020 --> 01:37:51,860
Wow.

3586
01:37:51,920 --> 01:37:54,050
That's a complete different
level of drug dealer.

3587
01:37:54,120 --> 01:37:54,490
That's,

3588
01:37:54,490 --> 01:37:55,080
you know,

3589
01:37:55,080 --> 01:37:56,280
there was a lot of those guys.

3590
01:37:56,280 --> 01:37:57,900
There's a lot of those
guys that made it very,

3591
01:37:57,901 --> 01:38:01,650
very high up and they always
maintain the celebrity connections.

3592
01:38:01,980 --> 01:38:02,311
You know,

3593
01:38:02,311 --> 01:38:07,170
they always maintain these weird weird
network of movie star friends and I mean

3594
01:38:07,171 --> 01:38:09,080
that's always the case whenever like in,

3595
01:38:09,090 --> 01:38:09,560
in,

3596
01:38:09,560 --> 01:38:10,950
in cocaine cowboys.

3597
01:38:10,951 --> 01:38:12,600
Did they talk about that
and cooking cowboys?

3598
01:38:12,940 --> 01:38:13,520
They would.

3599
01:38:13,520 --> 01:38:13,980
Was it?

3600
01:38:13,980 --> 01:38:14,251
No,

3601
01:38:14,251 --> 01:38:15,030
it was a different one.

3602
01:38:15,030 --> 01:38:16,650
It was another documentary
where they're talking about,

3603
01:38:16,651 --> 01:38:16,940
uh,

3604
01:38:16,940 --> 01:38:17,401
how these,

3605
01:38:17,401 --> 01:38:17,670
uh,

3606
01:38:17,670 --> 01:38:20,340
drug dealers love to be around
celebrities and you know,

3607
01:38:20,350 --> 01:38:21,840
kind of makes them feel
like they're legit.

3608
01:38:23,240 --> 01:38:24,570
It could be around Jack Nicholson,

3609
01:38:24,571 --> 01:38:24,781
man,

3610
01:38:24,781 --> 01:38:25,930
if you're a Jack Nicholson,

3611
01:38:26,970 --> 01:38:29,740
maybe it was the black dudes from Atlanta,

3612
01:38:29,830 --> 01:38:30,541
that valley,

3613
01:38:30,541 --> 01:38:32,880
they would just painful for
celebrities to come hang out with them.

3614
01:38:33,030 --> 01:38:33,390
Really,

3615
01:38:33,390 --> 01:38:34,171
they would just pull up,

3616
01:38:34,171 --> 01:38:37,050
gauge just how much the Joe Rogan
accomplish this mother fuckers.

3617
01:38:37,190 --> 01:38:39,360
Really the whole 50,000.

3618
01:38:39,361 --> 01:38:40,690
We'll give him 75 get his ass.

3619
01:38:40,690 --> 01:38:41,580
He a Friday night.

3620
01:38:41,760 --> 01:38:42,091
Do you,

3621
01:38:42,091 --> 01:38:44,430
do you ever do a
corporate gigs or someone,

3622
01:38:44,460 --> 01:38:46,740
some corporation asks you
to show up and do stand up?

3623
01:38:47,040 --> 01:38:47,520
Really?

3624
01:38:47,520 --> 01:38:48,960
I do one a year and I bombing.

3625
01:38:49,990 --> 01:38:50,910
That's the problem.

3626
01:38:50,940 --> 01:38:53,150
They're all death John
have on does a lot of,

3627
01:38:53,210 --> 01:38:54,210
it tends to like him.

3628
01:38:54,211 --> 01:38:55,110
He always get killer.

3629
01:38:55,320 --> 01:38:56,520
He's a killer for that stuff though.

3630
01:38:56,521 --> 01:38:57,540
His Act is perfect.

3631
01:38:57,541 --> 01:38:58,920
His Act is hilarious.

3632
01:38:58,921 --> 01:39:00,120
But squeaky clean.

3633
01:39:00,420 --> 01:39:01,770
You know John Half Ron is a,

3634
01:39:01,771 --> 01:39:03,720
he's the perfect guy for
like any corporate thing.

3635
01:39:03,940 --> 01:39:05,850
Stefan came up with a new idea,

3636
01:39:06,090 --> 01:39:06,331
you know,

3637
01:39:06,331 --> 01:39:07,040
I don't know if we should,

3638
01:39:07,040 --> 01:39:07,300
I don't know.

3639
01:39:07,300 --> 01:39:10,170
I can't say it because
it be giving up his idea,

3640
01:39:10,380 --> 01:39:11,213
but he's going to,

3641
01:39:11,480 --> 01:39:13,730
he's going to teach
comedy to people to like,

3642
01:39:13,790 --> 01:39:14,160
uh,

3643
01:39:14,160 --> 01:39:15,540
to help their businesses.

3644
01:39:15,870 --> 01:39:16,640
It's going to help them.

3645
01:39:16,640 --> 01:39:16,750
Uh,

3646
01:39:16,750 --> 01:39:17,580
I don't want to say anymore.

3647
01:39:17,580 --> 01:39:17,871
Right.

3648
01:39:17,871 --> 01:39:18,840
So his idea

3649
01:39:18,960 --> 01:39:19,350
something,

3650
01:39:19,350 --> 01:39:19,610
one,

3651
01:39:19,610 --> 01:39:21,840
one of those weird things
and I happened the other day,

3652
01:39:22,030 --> 01:39:24,150
we had a guy named Carlos on our,

3653
01:39:24,180 --> 01:39:25,980
one of our desk squad shows the other day.

3654
01:39:26,060 --> 01:39:26,880
I saw his name.

3655
01:39:26,880 --> 01:39:28,650
His name is Carlos Harena.

3656
01:39:29,130 --> 01:39:30,360
I'm saying his last name wrong.

3657
01:39:30,720 --> 01:39:32,130
Harissa Carlos.

3658
01:39:32,220 --> 01:39:32,850
I can't spell it.

3659
01:39:32,850 --> 01:39:36,360
H.

3660
01:39:36,360 --> 01:39:36,360
E.

3661
01:39:36,360 --> 01:39:36,360
R.

3662
01:39:36,360 --> 01:39:36,360
R.

3663
01:39:36,360 --> 01:39:36,360
E.

3664
01:39:36,360 --> 01:39:36,360
R.

3665
01:39:36,360 --> 01:39:36,820
A.

3666
01:39:36,820 --> 01:39:38,430
I always was Herrera Herrera.

3667
01:39:38,431 --> 01:39:39,410
I can never say his last name.

3668
01:39:39,820 --> 01:39:40,350
Anyways.

3669
01:39:40,350 --> 01:39:40,830
Uh,

3670
01:39:40,830 --> 01:39:41,663
we,

3671
01:39:42,300 --> 01:39:44,480
the Salvia show you're talking about.

3672
01:39:44,530 --> 01:39:44,780
Yeah.

3673
01:39:44,780 --> 01:39:47,520
What we did is we had a show where
we had all these people do Salvia,

3674
01:39:47,550 --> 01:39:49,760
Ari Shaffir did Salvy
we have a lawn tomorrow,

3675
01:39:50,010 --> 01:39:51,330
so we'll talk about talking about.

3676
01:39:51,331 --> 01:39:51,940
Nice.

3677
01:39:51,940 --> 01:39:52,420
Uh,

3678
01:39:52,420 --> 01:39:54,370
and then we had a couple of
other people that never did sell.

3679
01:39:54,430 --> 01:39:55,650
One person was Alison.

3680
01:39:55,860 --> 01:39:57,810
We had her on the podcast a while back.

3681
01:39:57,870 --> 01:39:58,201
Uh,

3682
01:39:58,201 --> 01:40:00,060
Alison Shula and out of nowhere,

3683
01:40:00,061 --> 01:40:01,000
I haven't talked to her months.

3684
01:40:01,030 --> 01:40:01,410
I just,

3685
01:40:01,410 --> 01:40:02,071
I just thought,

3686
01:40:02,071 --> 01:40:02,281
Hey,

3687
01:40:02,281 --> 01:40:03,240
I'm gonna call Alison up.

3688
01:40:03,480 --> 01:40:05,760
So she comes over and we have Carlos on.

3689
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:07,590
And the reason why we had Carlos on his,

3690
01:40:07,710 --> 01:40:10,860
because he was one of the guys
responsible making this thing called,

3691
01:40:10,940 --> 01:40:11,100
uh,

3692
01:40:11,100 --> 01:40:14,970
the mostly normal show presents
the outing of a joke thief.

3693
01:40:15,360 --> 01:40:16,480
See what happened is this,

3694
01:40:16,500 --> 01:40:18,210
there's this guy that we
had talked about and they,

3695
01:40:18,220 --> 01:40:18,990
Mitch,

3696
01:40:18,990 --> 01:40:19,710
Mitch [inaudible],

3697
01:40:19,710 --> 01:40:20,370
Mitch [inaudible],

3698
01:40:20,370 --> 01:40:22,680
he's a really nice guy
who died a few years back.

3699
01:40:23,430 --> 01:40:24,061
He said this,

3700
01:40:24,061 --> 01:40:24,780
he died.

3701
01:40:24,780 --> 01:40:25,613
And uh,

3702
01:40:25,680 --> 01:40:30,680
this guy has taken his act joke
by joke and it wasn't even like,

3703
01:40:30,931 --> 01:40:32,430
he just took the joke out of it.

3704
01:40:32,580 --> 01:40:37,530
He actually watched a video of it
and memorized how the guy did it.

3705
01:40:37,670 --> 01:40:37,950
Like,

3706
01:40:37,950 --> 01:40:39,240
like almost like an actor.

3707
01:40:39,700 --> 01:40:41,130
It's so creepy to watch.

3708
01:40:41,131 --> 01:40:41,880
So these guys,

3709
01:40:41,880 --> 01:40:42,270
uh,

3710
01:40:42,270 --> 01:40:43,010
they kind of,

3711
01:40:43,010 --> 01:40:43,400
hmm,

3712
01:40:43,400 --> 01:40:44,690
I I see where this is going.

3713
01:40:44,780 --> 01:40:46,130
I would rather not play this on the show.

3714
01:40:46,180 --> 01:40:46,451
Oh No,

3715
01:40:46,451 --> 01:40:47,150
we won't play that.

3716
01:40:47,150 --> 01:40:47,801
People can check it out.

3717
01:40:47,801 --> 01:40:49,450
But this is how crazy this is.

3718
01:40:49,451 --> 01:40:49,880
I mean,

3719
01:40:49,880 --> 01:40:50,290
uh,

3720
01:40:50,290 --> 01:40:54,030
the video is identical
from the two like sure.

3721
01:40:54,070 --> 01:40:54,760
Like it's crazy.

3722
01:40:54,760 --> 01:40:55,600
But the weird thing is,

3723
01:40:55,601 --> 01:40:56,980
remember when Alison was on,

3724
01:40:56,981 --> 01:41:01,390
and we had talked about being a open mic
comic and how a lot of these guys are

3725
01:41:01,391 --> 01:41:04,600
doing these tricks and one of the things
that Allison was talking about is how

3726
01:41:04,601 --> 01:41:09,340
this guy wanted her to pay $100 in order
to do five minutes in the belly ring

3727
01:41:09,670 --> 01:41:10,360
belly room.

3728
01:41:10,360 --> 01:41:13,210
And she was going to do that because she
thought that's what you had to do to be

3729
01:41:13,211 --> 01:41:15,100
an open mic comic hundred dollars.

3730
01:41:15,410 --> 01:41:17,110
This guy was scamming her,

3731
01:41:17,350 --> 01:41:21,580
found out that during that episode of
the Salvia video found out this is the

3732
01:41:21,581 --> 01:41:22,241
same guy,

3733
01:41:22,241 --> 01:41:26,170
that joke thief guy that was scamming her
add money and other open comics out of

3734
01:41:26,171 --> 01:41:27,004
money.

3735
01:41:27,360 --> 01:41:30,630
She paid a hundred girls sucking my
dick and giving me cope from Julie.

3736
01:41:31,230 --> 01:41:32,340
You think I'm fucking kidding you?

3737
01:41:32,341 --> 01:41:32,791
Fuck yeah,

3738
01:41:32,791 --> 01:41:35,340
you got to suck my Dick Nigga up in
the belly room and make a call for you.

3739
01:41:35,341 --> 01:41:36,030
That's the,

3740
01:41:36,030 --> 01:41:38,220
that's the fucking gateway
in to come in the Hollywood.

3741
01:41:38,221 --> 01:41:38,910
Everybody knows that.

3742
01:41:38,910 --> 01:41:40,020
How many girls did you have to do that?

3743
01:41:40,110 --> 01:41:40,950
All 20 of them.

3744
01:41:41,850 --> 01:41:45,510
I had this little blind open mic check
dog that used to come up to the comedy

3745
01:41:45,511 --> 01:41:49,400
store with 20 and just take me up to the
belly room was suck my dick then go do

3746
01:41:49,401 --> 01:41:49,771
his set.

3747
01:41:49,771 --> 01:41:50,610
She was tremendous.

3748
01:41:50,760 --> 01:41:51,211
Wow.

3749
01:41:51,211 --> 01:41:54,960
Finally freaked out when she got the
Hollywood bowl and she was beautiful and

3750
01:41:54,961 --> 01:41:59,070
when she left she had dirty fucking nails
with dirty and then a year later she

3751
01:41:59,071 --> 01:42:00,170
wrote me a letter to the calm,

3752
01:42:00,171 --> 01:42:00,451
you still,

3753
01:42:00,451 --> 01:42:01,141
you cock sucker.

3754
01:42:01,141 --> 01:42:01,974
You left me.

3755
01:42:02,820 --> 01:42:06,920
I kept shooting sperm balls
in her fucking hair ball.

3756
01:42:07,350 --> 01:42:10,020
Every time she went down
to the body I bought Bingo.

3757
01:42:10,540 --> 01:42:11,221
It ain't broken.

3758
01:42:11,221 --> 01:42:11,371
Throw.

3759
01:42:11,371 --> 01:42:12,250
Somebody fixes it.

3760
01:42:13,470 --> 01:42:17,220
This is the picture that guy that stole
the comics and he look what he's reading

3761
01:42:17,220 --> 01:42:19,230
is reading the idiot's
guide to comedy writing.

3762
01:42:19,290 --> 01:42:20,010
Yeah.

3763
01:42:20,010 --> 01:42:20,843
Listen man,

3764
01:42:21,210 --> 01:42:22,800
that dude's living in his own hell.

3765
01:42:22,830 --> 01:42:23,930
There's no need to outdoor guy.

3766
01:42:23,950 --> 01:42:24,550
He's,

3767
01:42:24,550 --> 01:42:26,890
it's obviously all out there,

3768
01:42:28,650 --> 01:42:29,340
but check it out.

3769
01:42:29,340 --> 01:42:29,970
I don't really

3770
01:42:29,970 --> 01:42:31,770
shocking video Joe you and actually like,

3771
01:42:31,771 --> 01:42:32,730
I didn't really want to watch it

3772
01:42:32,780 --> 01:42:34,790
but I don't want to watch it
because Mitch was a friend of mine.

3773
01:42:34,791 --> 01:42:35,624
He was a nice guy.

3774
01:42:36,820 --> 01:42:37,490
Poor fuck.

3775
01:42:37,490 --> 01:42:41,810
What this guy is is just some guy who
thinks he can slither into this world.

3776
01:42:42,020 --> 01:42:42,381
You know,

3777
01:42:42,381 --> 01:42:45,120
it's like we were talking about earlier
this comics and then this people who

3778
01:42:45,121 --> 01:42:47,270
think they could figure
out a way to be a comic,

3779
01:42:47,480 --> 01:42:48,020
you know,

3780
01:42:48,020 --> 01:42:48,411
let me look.

3781
01:42:48,411 --> 01:42:51,380
We all want to be's were all
want to in the beginning,

3782
01:42:51,590 --> 01:42:54,980
but eventually you either embrace
the art form or you don't.

3783
01:42:55,160 --> 01:42:56,660
Everybody in the beginning is a fraud.

3784
01:42:56,690 --> 01:42:59,420
Everyone is in the beginning is
pretending you're make believing you're a

3785
01:42:59,421 --> 01:43:02,240
comedian and some people think
that this is the way to do it.

3786
01:43:02,241 --> 01:43:02,901
This guy's an idiot.

3787
01:43:02,901 --> 01:43:03,470
He's probably been,

3788
01:43:03,470 --> 01:43:05,060
you hear about the hundred dollars thing.

3789
01:43:05,210 --> 01:43:06,890
He's probably been running
his whole life like that.

3790
01:43:06,891 --> 01:43:08,160
Just one scan.

3791
01:43:08,630 --> 01:43:11,240
I wouldn't have asked for
$100 a blow job is legit.

3792
01:43:11,390 --> 01:43:12,590
That's known.

3793
01:43:12,620 --> 01:43:13,111
You know what I'm saying?

3794
01:43:13,111 --> 01:43:13,944
And that's right.

3795
01:43:14,230 --> 01:43:16,040
A blow job in the hundred dollars is bad,

3796
01:43:16,160 --> 01:43:16,371
right?

3797
01:43:16,371 --> 01:43:16,971
When you shoot it,

3798
01:43:16,971 --> 01:43:18,020
I am become death.

3799
01:43:18,100 --> 01:43:20,510
If you strongly believe by sucking a Dick,

3800
01:43:20,511 --> 01:43:21,530
you're going to get onstage.

3801
01:43:21,830 --> 01:43:22,663
Shame on you.

3802
01:43:22,940 --> 01:43:24,650
But sometimes if they buy it,

3803
01:43:24,651 --> 01:43:26,430
I got the fucking Russian you,

3804
01:43:26,450 --> 01:43:27,710
they did get onstage.

3805
01:43:27,740 --> 01:43:28,251
What are you saying?

3806
01:43:28,251 --> 01:43:30,120
If you believe that's
how you got him on stage,

3807
01:43:30,150 --> 01:43:30,650
you suck.

3808
01:43:30,650 --> 01:43:31,520
They suck your Dick.

3809
01:43:31,521 --> 01:43:32,540
You did put them on stage.

3810
01:43:32,541 --> 01:43:33,860
So why wouldn't they believe it?

3811
01:43:33,890 --> 01:43:34,070
I'm,

3812
01:43:34,070 --> 01:43:34,761
that's reality.

3813
01:43:34,761 --> 01:43:37,790
Never forget that that blonde
girl at first time I told it dog,

3814
01:43:38,150 --> 01:43:38,601
I was like,

3815
01:43:38,601 --> 01:43:40,010
she came up on a Friday night.

3816
01:43:40,011 --> 01:43:40,700
She's like,

3817
01:43:40,700 --> 01:43:41,081
Joey,

3818
01:43:41,081 --> 01:43:42,150
I know you know people.

3819
01:43:42,151 --> 01:43:42,530
You get me.

3820
01:43:42,530 --> 01:43:45,910
And I looked at straight to
the face as a joke and I go,

3821
01:43:45,980 --> 01:43:46,460
go,

3822
01:43:46,460 --> 01:43:47,580
you're gonna have to say no.

3823
01:43:47,581 --> 01:43:47,991
I said to,

3824
01:43:47,991 --> 01:43:49,200
I didn't even say Suck Dick to be.

3825
01:43:49,240 --> 01:43:50,073
I said,

3826
01:43:50,120 --> 01:43:51,010
I get you on stage,

3827
01:43:51,050 --> 01:43:51,883
we have to work.

3828
01:43:52,220 --> 01:43:52,671
And she goes,

3829
01:43:52,671 --> 01:43:55,480
what do you mean like a little
put you to work at this?

3830
01:43:55,490 --> 01:43:56,330
You got to do something.

3831
01:43:56,360 --> 01:43:57,230
You gotta do something

3832
01:43:57,690 --> 01:43:58,080
rather way.

3833
01:43:58,080 --> 01:43:58,913
They know.

3834
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:01,230
They know there's a
fucking cost at the gate.

3835
01:44:01,620 --> 01:44:02,640
They even look at you like,

3836
01:44:02,641 --> 01:44:02,791
what?

3837
01:44:02,791 --> 01:44:03,510
Those puppets,

3838
01:44:03,510 --> 01:44:04,560
and she even looked at me and goes,

3839
01:44:04,800 --> 01:44:06,690
I'm not really good at
you have to teach me.

3840
01:44:06,750 --> 01:44:07,501
Oh,

3841
01:44:07,501 --> 01:44:08,100
sell for it.

3842
01:44:08,100 --> 01:44:09,510
Beautiful for themselves.

3843
01:44:09,511 --> 01:44:10,321
They know that.

3844
01:44:10,321 --> 01:44:11,330
Told that that's what,

3845
01:44:11,340 --> 01:44:12,173
that's comedy.

3846
01:44:13,040 --> 01:44:18,040
Would it make it even better when a girl
says that you can have to ta was this

3847
01:44:18,511 --> 01:44:19,390
that Oh God damn.

3848
01:44:19,410 --> 01:44:20,243
Just to learn.

3849
01:44:20,400 --> 01:44:23,430
Should we gave a seven twenties for a
hundred went back to her house and I told

3850
01:44:23,431 --> 01:44:24,770
him at the house we had a great time of,

3851
01:44:24,810 --> 01:44:25,950
but she had a period,

3852
01:44:25,951 --> 01:44:27,490
but I went to either
ask you a tissue paper.

3853
01:44:30,090 --> 01:44:30,923
Oh

3854
01:44:32,810 --> 01:44:33,471
and I just suck.

3855
01:44:33,471 --> 01:44:34,310
You Suck my Dick.

3856
01:44:34,311 --> 01:44:35,144
I can't handle that.

3857
01:44:35,170 --> 01:44:35,850
Buffalo,

3858
01:44:35,850 --> 01:44:37,280
it was like five in the morning.

3859
01:44:37,560 --> 01:44:37,720
Oh,

3860
01:44:37,720 --> 01:44:38,181
that point.

3861
01:44:38,181 --> 01:44:39,230
I'll get all fucked up.

3862
01:44:40,430 --> 01:44:42,410
I wouldn't need to get a little
pussy if you had a period,

3863
01:44:42,411 --> 01:44:42,721
but I will.

3864
01:44:42,721 --> 01:44:43,061
I'll look.

3865
01:44:43,061 --> 01:44:43,400
Yes.

3866
01:44:43,400 --> 01:44:45,030
I'll just write the payment cycle.

3867
01:44:45,050 --> 01:44:45,320
Whack,

3868
01:44:45,320 --> 01:44:46,141
lump on your neck,

3869
01:44:46,141 --> 01:44:46,700
us up.

3870
01:44:46,700 --> 01:44:47,533
You know what I'm saying?

3871
01:44:52,420 --> 01:44:52,910
Oh,

3872
01:44:52,910 --> 01:44:54,600
I got to look a little muffly just to,

3873
01:44:54,680 --> 01:44:57,320
I get the party started and
she had like a little crumble,

3874
01:44:57,321 --> 01:45:00,410
like it was just not even
like what it was like a,

3875
01:45:00,420 --> 01:45:02,870
it was like a little crumble
dingleberry like not even,

3876
01:45:02,871 --> 01:45:03,681
it wasn't a dingleberry.

3877
01:45:03,681 --> 01:45:05,370
It's like somebody shut a
spit ball and then it has

3878
01:45:08,610 --> 01:45:12,930
fuck this and it was just dangling
there that it just killed me dog.

3879
01:45:12,931 --> 01:45:13,250
I was like,

3880
01:45:13,250 --> 01:45:13,351
oh,

3881
01:45:13,351 --> 01:45:17,040
I can't even use a rest my dick the whole
night and I haven't known how to work

3882
01:45:17,041 --> 01:45:19,950
with Paul Rodriguez and I can say mark
Babbitt picked me up like at eight in the

3883
01:45:19,951 --> 01:45:20,440
morning.

3884
01:45:20,440 --> 01:45:21,000
I know,

3885
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:21,680
ma'am.

3886
01:45:21,680 --> 01:45:22,730
Did you get a good night's sleep?

3887
01:45:22,740 --> 01:45:23,071
Oh yeah,

3888
01:45:23,071 --> 01:45:23,904
sure.

3889
01:45:24,240 --> 01:45:25,073
Fuck out of here.

3890
01:45:26,220 --> 01:45:27,880
I'm going to get my dick sucked him.

3891
01:45:27,950 --> 01:45:32,400
My boss Lik that's commonly
stole one old one the old days,

3892
01:45:32,401 --> 01:45:33,234
Joe Rogan.

3893
01:45:33,350 --> 01:45:33,890
God,

3894
01:45:33,890 --> 01:45:37,100
a bunch of Shit happens since we stopped
doing the podcast in the last two

3895
01:45:37,101 --> 01:45:37,670
weeks.

3896
01:45:37,670 --> 01:45:39,740
One of them is the Arnold
Schwartzenegger thing.

3897
01:45:40,550 --> 01:45:44,210
God Damn is this one of the
craziest fucking stories ever.

3898
01:45:44,690 --> 01:45:48,530
Arnold Schwarzenegger apparently
was not just fucking this lady.

3899
01:45:48,560 --> 01:45:51,380
This housekeeper tried to fuck her mom.

3900
01:45:51,590 --> 01:45:52,220
What?

3901
01:45:52,220 --> 01:45:52,700
Yeah,

3902
01:45:52,700 --> 01:45:55,280
he groped her mom and
he groped her sister.

3903
01:45:55,340 --> 01:45:59,060
They all worked for him and those pitches
will I get out of here and then he

3904
01:45:59,061 --> 01:46:01,060
great grow up that one
lady and she was like,

3905
01:46:01,080 --> 01:46:01,260
oh,

3906
01:46:01,260 --> 01:46:03,080
come on and do some of that Conan Dick.

3907
01:46:03,590 --> 01:46:04,423
That's crazy.

3908
01:46:04,460 --> 01:46:07,900
It's hotter cause I had to be all there.

3909
01:46:08,220 --> 01:46:08,781
They're all got,

3910
01:46:08,781 --> 01:46:09,140
come on.

3911
01:46:09,140 --> 01:46:10,340
Little don't think it matters.

3912
01:46:10,520 --> 01:46:12,080
I think he's one of those dudes.

3913
01:46:12,081 --> 01:46:12,501
And you know,

3914
01:46:12,501 --> 01:46:13,830
Ryan Parson said it pat.

3915
01:46:13,831 --> 01:46:15,860
So I was hanging out
doing a movie with Ryan,

3916
01:46:16,130 --> 01:46:16,601
who's a,

3917
01:46:16,601 --> 01:46:16,790
the,

3918
01:46:16,790 --> 01:46:17,241
one of the,

3919
01:46:17,241 --> 01:46:18,074
uh,

3920
01:46:18,350 --> 01:46:20,990
one of the best coaches in
MMA and he cheese mayhem,

3921
01:46:20,991 --> 01:46:21,824
Miller's coach.

3922
01:46:21,830 --> 01:46:22,310
And we were,

3923
01:46:22,310 --> 01:46:23,390
he's a smart dude.

3924
01:46:23,391 --> 01:46:26,300
He breaks things down and we were
talking about Arnold and he goes,

3925
01:46:26,301 --> 01:46:26,541
you know,

3926
01:46:26,541 --> 01:46:26,931
one man,

3927
01:46:26,931 --> 01:46:27,201
he goes,

3928
01:46:27,201 --> 01:46:28,250
I'm not surprised at all.

3929
01:46:28,251 --> 01:46:28,491
He goes,

3930
01:46:28,491 --> 01:46:31,640
he was a professional
bodybuilder and I was like,

3931
01:46:31,641 --> 01:46:32,091
you're right.

3932
01:46:32,091 --> 01:46:35,810
Like don't a lot of those guys do a lot
of gay shit because they need money and

3933
01:46:35,811 --> 01:46:37,670
apparently gay dudes
will pay bodybuilders.

3934
01:46:37,671 --> 01:46:38,504
Ridiculous heels.

3935
01:46:38,540 --> 01:46:38,720
Like,

3936
01:46:38,720 --> 01:46:39,470
Oh yeah,

3937
01:46:39,470 --> 01:46:39,741
he was,

3938
01:46:39,741 --> 01:46:41,720
especially back in the 70s he goes,

3939
01:46:41,721 --> 01:46:43,830
they were all suck and rich guys cost

3940
01:46:45,370 --> 01:46:45,810
money.

3941
01:46:45,810 --> 01:46:46,320
Yeah.

3942
01:46:46,320 --> 01:46:49,560
He said it used to dress up my Batman
suit and go to fucking rich white bodies

3943
01:46:49,561 --> 01:46:50,760
and shit with a little mask on it.

3944
01:46:50,761 --> 01:46:52,170
I don't think he would even have a copy,

3945
01:46:52,180 --> 01:46:53,013
which is of him,

3946
01:46:53,070 --> 01:46:53,341
you know,

3947
01:46:53,341 --> 01:46:53,820
he's,

3948
01:46:53,820 --> 01:46:54,241
he,

3949
01:46:54,241 --> 01:46:54,540
he's,

3950
01:46:54,540 --> 01:46:55,590
he was so weird.

3951
01:46:55,830 --> 01:46:56,031
You know,

3952
01:46:56,031 --> 01:46:58,170
I can remember when he did
pumping iron and he started,

3953
01:46:58,200 --> 01:46:58,800
man,

3954
01:46:58,800 --> 01:46:59,760
I'm always gumming.

3955
01:46:59,910 --> 01:47:02,790
Every time I have a palm
bay bamboo is like calming.

3956
01:47:02,850 --> 01:47:04,860
So I'm always palmed them always coming.

3957
01:47:04,861 --> 01:47:06,120
I'm coming all the time.

3958
01:47:06,360 --> 01:47:09,030
Like just the fact that he would think
that it's cool to just like talk about

3959
01:47:09,031 --> 01:47:12,210
just shooting loads all the time in
1978 or whatever the fuck it was.

3960
01:47:12,420 --> 01:47:15,780
He's doing a documentary
about bodybuilding and here's
this dude with a little

3961
01:47:15,781 --> 01:47:18,150
fucking banana hammock
on talking about coming.

3962
01:47:18,151 --> 01:47:19,390
I'm coming off the dime.

3963
01:47:20,160 --> 01:47:20,580
He's,

3964
01:47:20,580 --> 01:47:21,840
he's a weird man.

3965
01:47:21,841 --> 01:47:22,260
He's a,

3966
01:47:22,260 --> 01:47:23,190
he's a freak.

3967
01:47:23,310 --> 01:47:27,360
He's a freak and then Jane Seymour comes
out and says that he's apparently got a

3968
01:47:27,361 --> 01:47:28,650
bunch of little love children.

3969
01:47:29,290 --> 01:47:30,810
I guarantee he's going
to buy eight of them.

3970
01:47:30,930 --> 01:47:32,100
He's just a savage.

3971
01:47:32,101 --> 01:47:36,270
He's just shooting those barbarian loads
and the women that the ball from the

3972
01:47:36,271 --> 01:47:39,070
seventh I shouldn't make
them Germans go cray.

3973
01:47:39,080 --> 01:47:41,860
That's what killing him to go bananas.

3974
01:47:42,190 --> 01:47:44,140
That people that the ball,

3975
01:47:44,141 --> 01:47:47,010
what's not a shift in the 70s I
used to just swell your shit up.

3976
01:47:47,130 --> 01:47:48,810
See now they got refined steroids.

3977
01:47:48,811 --> 01:47:53,270
I don't make you a fucking savage or
Arnold was legendary for doing every day.

3978
01:47:53,290 --> 01:47:53,800
Every day.

3979
01:47:53,800 --> 01:47:55,620
Always talk about whatever everybody,

3980
01:47:55,680 --> 01:47:58,980
anyone who was doing Arnold was
taking shit to the next level.

3981
01:47:58,981 --> 01:48:00,150
Ball walking.

3982
01:48:00,320 --> 01:48:03,030
He even shot fucking
Lance Armstrong and shit.

3983
01:48:03,031 --> 01:48:03,864
That motherfucker,

3984
01:48:03,980 --> 01:48:04,813
you're seeing,

3985
01:48:05,770 --> 01:48:07,410
you had lance Armstrong suck.

3986
01:48:07,411 --> 01:48:07,831
It lands.

3987
01:48:07,831 --> 01:48:08,940
You're doing an old wrong.

3988
01:48:09,870 --> 01:48:12,600
You don't even nuts and
berries and the designer.

3989
01:48:12,601 --> 01:48:16,170
I don't think I've ever heard of the nice
thing about Lance Armstrong and when I

3990
01:48:16,171 --> 01:48:17,760
seen that thing on 60 minutes,

3991
01:48:18,090 --> 01:48:21,330
all I kept thinking about was it
couldn't happen to a fucking nice a guy.

3992
01:48:21,360 --> 01:48:21,481
Well,

3993
01:48:21,481 --> 01:48:22,710
I'll tell you one in Austin,

3994
01:48:22,711 --> 01:48:23,550
when we go to Austin,

3995
01:48:23,551 --> 01:48:25,530
we never hear nothing but
shitty things about him.

3996
01:48:25,530 --> 01:48:25,741
Yeah,

3997
01:48:25,741 --> 01:48:26,101
I couldn't.

3998
01:48:26,101 --> 01:48:27,450
I've heard this weird man.

3999
01:48:28,190 --> 01:48:29,730
He did something to somebody I know in La,

4000
01:48:29,731 --> 01:48:31,080
something shitty at a restaurant.

4001
01:48:31,081 --> 01:48:31,590
Something happened.

4002
01:48:31,590 --> 01:48:32,370
You talked to the Lord,

4003
01:48:32,370 --> 01:48:33,480
the wrong people.

4004
01:48:33,481 --> 01:48:35,520
You can get shitty stories
about the nicest people.

4005
01:48:35,521 --> 01:48:35,640
No,

4006
01:48:35,640 --> 01:48:36,660
I bet up somewhere out there,

4007
01:48:36,661 --> 01:48:37,494
Henry Winkler,

4008
01:48:37,530 --> 01:48:40,170
there's some asshole
shitty Henry Winkler story.

4009
01:48:40,171 --> 01:48:41,820
It's just if you deal with sheer numbers,

4010
01:48:42,030 --> 01:48:42,571
but you know,

4011
01:48:42,571 --> 01:48:44,910
if you do like most people
you talk to and they say,

4012
01:48:44,911 --> 01:48:45,181
oh,

4013
01:48:45,181 --> 01:48:46,260
I met Randy coture.

4014
01:48:46,270 --> 01:48:47,220
I such a nice guy,

4015
01:48:47,221 --> 01:48:47,491
isn't he?

4016
01:48:47,491 --> 01:48:48,720
Like most people will tell you that,

4017
01:48:48,860 --> 01:48:49,651
but he a few.

4018
01:48:49,651 --> 01:48:52,650
Every now and then you get some one dude
that was probably annoying as fuck and

4019
01:48:52,770 --> 01:48:55,580
came up to Randy and tried to get him
in a headlock by picture when you're at

4020
01:48:55,590 --> 01:48:56,400
the restaurant,

4021
01:48:56,400 --> 01:48:57,221
interrupted him.

4022
01:48:57,221 --> 01:48:59,370
I was eating dinner or something
and whatever the fuck it was.

4023
01:48:59,520 --> 01:49:01,260
And so then you'll get a
shitty Randy coture story.

4024
01:49:01,261 --> 01:49:05,550
But I never heard a good Lance Armstrong
story every time you were in Austin.

4025
01:49:05,551 --> 01:49:05,950
I have a hard,

4026
01:49:05,950 --> 01:49:09,100
but we were all hearing it from
waiters and waitresses and yeah,

4027
01:49:09,101 --> 01:49:11,670
and people that know
people that ran into him.

4028
01:49:11,671 --> 01:49:12,900
It was never good.

4029
01:49:13,720 --> 01:49:14,010
You know,

4030
01:49:14,010 --> 01:49:18,750
to be that dude to be a one
dude who pretends that he's
the one who wasn't doing

4031
01:49:18,751 --> 01:49:21,200
shit when everyone else is doing.

4032
01:49:21,210 --> 01:49:22,050
I love that shit.

4033
01:49:22,051 --> 01:49:23,160
I love when they get nailed.

4034
01:49:23,161 --> 01:49:24,470
Don't have some fucking dignity.

4035
01:49:24,500 --> 01:49:25,380
Be a fucking man.

4036
01:49:25,740 --> 01:49:26,041
Nah,

4037
01:49:26,041 --> 01:49:26,731
he don't know.

4038
01:49:26,731 --> 01:49:28,350
He wants to stand behind the paperwork.

4039
01:49:28,470 --> 01:49:33,240
Yes and no because there's a big business
behind all this k and there's a lot of

4040
01:49:33,241 --> 01:49:36,150
people that knew he was doing things
is one of the things in the 60 minutes

4041
01:49:36,151 --> 01:49:37,260
documentary about it,

4042
01:49:37,261 --> 01:49:38,400
the 60 minutes coverage of it.

4043
01:49:38,610 --> 01:49:43,200
They say that he tested positive for EPO
at one point in time and then after he

4044
01:49:43,201 --> 01:49:44,011
tested positive,

4045
01:49:44,011 --> 01:49:46,020
he donated money to this,

4046
01:49:46,140 --> 01:49:51,140
this blood scanning foundation that bus
people for for fucking testing positive

4047
01:49:51,521 --> 01:49:52,000
for shit.

4048
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:55,480
He don't even like 25 grand and then
he donated another hundred grand in the

4049
01:49:55,481 --> 01:49:55,760
future.

4050
01:49:55,760 --> 01:49:56,540
Like what?

4051
01:49:56,540 --> 01:49:58,120
But you mean that's a payoff man.

4052
01:49:58,121 --> 01:49:59,360
That's like a direction shit.

4053
01:49:59,520 --> 01:50:02,260
This guy was really doing
EPO and all the other dudes,

4054
01:50:02,261 --> 01:50:03,640
they're busting them left and right.

4055
01:50:03,700 --> 01:50:04,600
They all have to,

4056
01:50:04,670 --> 01:50:07,720
they all have to come clean and
they have to tell only the truth.

4057
01:50:07,721 --> 01:50:10,750
Cause if they get caught with anything
then their immunity goes out the window.

4058
01:50:10,870 --> 01:50:12,610
So they give him a limited
amount of immunity.

4059
01:50:12,700 --> 01:50:15,370
We tell them we want to know
every fucking thing that happened.

4060
01:50:15,460 --> 01:50:17,140
And if you lie about one thing,

4061
01:50:17,200 --> 01:50:18,250
you're going to jail,

4062
01:50:18,310 --> 01:50:19,420
your immunities gone.

4063
01:50:19,510 --> 01:50:21,250
You're going to jail for everything
you've already admitted to.

4064
01:50:21,251 --> 01:50:24,700
So that 25 fucking years you
believe that shouldn't go steroids.

4065
01:50:25,330 --> 01:50:29,110
I'm sorry because I made a joke and
I got plenty for the five emails from

4066
01:50:29,111 --> 01:50:29,590
people.

4067
01:50:29,590 --> 01:50:30,460
Hey fat ass.

4068
01:50:30,770 --> 01:50:32,110
He wasn't doing steroids,

4069
01:50:32,320 --> 01:50:33,670
he was doing tests or whatever.

4070
01:50:33,850 --> 01:50:34,780
You know what bitch,

4071
01:50:34,870 --> 01:50:35,710
he was still cheap.

4072
01:50:36,160 --> 01:50:38,140
That's like me telling
you I wasn't doing heroin.

4073
01:50:38,141 --> 01:50:38,974
I was doing though.

4074
01:50:39,190 --> 01:50:40,300
It's the same fucking different.

4075
01:50:40,380 --> 01:50:41,850
I think they all do it though.

4076
01:50:41,910 --> 01:50:43,140
I think in that sport.

4077
01:50:43,170 --> 01:50:44,820
I think in that sport they have to,

4078
01:50:44,940 --> 01:50:45,541
I don't think,

4079
01:50:45,541 --> 01:50:46,010
you know,

4080
01:50:46,010 --> 01:50:46,340
um,

4081
01:50:46,340 --> 01:50:48,180
they test you and you're
not supposed to do it,

4082
01:50:48,181 --> 01:50:48,420
right?

4083
01:50:48,420 --> 01:50:48,810
Yeah.

4084
01:50:48,810 --> 01:50:48,991
Yeah.

4085
01:50:48,991 --> 01:50:52,230
And then they'd blood dope as well
instead of taking just the EPO,

4086
01:50:52,231 --> 01:50:53,160
they blood dope dope.

4087
01:50:53,580 --> 01:50:54,120
And there,

4088
01:50:54,120 --> 01:50:54,480
that's,

4089
01:50:54,480 --> 01:50:55,380
that's a fact.

4090
01:50:55,410 --> 01:50:55,651
I mean,

4091
01:50:55,651 --> 01:50:55,851
you know,

4092
01:50:55,851 --> 01:50:56,190
Joe,

4093
01:50:56,190 --> 01:50:56,881
they've been doing that.

4094
01:50:56,881 --> 01:50:58,170
He can't catch people.

4095
01:50:58,590 --> 01:51:02,270
We have it right in the wrong sometimes
in life is sometimes for fucking riding

4096
01:51:02,271 --> 01:51:02,671
a bike.

4097
01:51:02,671 --> 01:51:03,540
You gotta do this shit.

4098
01:51:04,110 --> 01:51:05,340
This guy was said somewhere,

4099
01:51:06,060 --> 01:51:06,361
you know,

4100
01:51:06,361 --> 01:51:09,750
I don't think they should arrest Barry
bonds now after he retired two years ago.

4101
01:51:09,751 --> 01:51:11,340
Now I'm breaking his balls.

4102
01:51:11,700 --> 01:51:12,140
It's over.

4103
01:51:12,140 --> 01:51:13,470
And when did they get Barry bonds on?

4104
01:51:13,471 --> 01:51:14,970
They got him on some real minor shit.

4105
01:51:14,971 --> 01:51:15,571
Like lying.

4106
01:51:15,571 --> 01:51:15,781
Right.

4107
01:51:15,781 --> 01:51:16,570
You're talking about?

4108
01:51:16,570 --> 01:51:19,270
Probably about they'll help you
with something that gets you,

4109
01:51:19,271 --> 01:51:19,661
they'll find,

4110
01:51:19,661 --> 01:51:20,251
so yeah,

4111
01:51:20,251 --> 01:51:21,240
they get you on perjury,

4112
01:51:21,241 --> 01:51:21,540
right?

4113
01:51:21,540 --> 01:51:23,270
So even if you lie,

4114
01:51:23,370 --> 01:51:24,570
who was going to tell
me that you would go?

4115
01:51:24,571 --> 01:51:24,711
Come,

4116
01:51:24,711 --> 01:51:25,830
can I talk to any other room?

4117
01:51:25,980 --> 01:51:26,520
Listen,

4118
01:51:26,520 --> 01:51:28,530
I got 19 fucking sponsorships for right.

4119
01:51:28,650 --> 01:51:30,000
One of them is a Catholic church.

4120
01:51:30,150 --> 01:51:32,490
You want it all Christian Church
and the other one's gate array.

4121
01:51:32,700 --> 01:51:34,950
You want to ask me if I do
steroids on a fucking camera?

4122
01:51:34,951 --> 01:51:35,790
What do you want me to tell you?

4123
01:51:36,210 --> 01:51:36,871
What are you want me to tell you?

4124
01:51:36,871 --> 01:51:38,220
I've got millions of fucking stake here.

4125
01:51:38,230 --> 01:51:39,063
What do you want me to tell you?

4126
01:51:39,150 --> 01:51:40,050
It's not perjury.

4127
01:51:40,170 --> 01:51:40,651
We did it.

4128
01:51:40,651 --> 01:51:41,940
You don't want me in the hall of fame?

4129
01:51:42,150 --> 01:51:43,170
Go Fuck Yourself.

4130
01:51:43,260 --> 01:51:44,900
I got a pension and I got money coming,

4131
01:51:45,090 --> 01:51:47,070
but you're going to
waste taxpayers' money.

4132
01:51:48,540 --> 01:51:49,770
Barry Bonds to court.

4133
01:51:49,771 --> 01:51:50,604
Who did he hurt?

4134
01:51:51,090 --> 01:51:52,710
It is interesting though,

4135
01:51:52,711 --> 01:51:56,370
because you got to think that if these
guys are doing shit that's dangerous for

4136
01:51:56,371 --> 01:51:59,220
their body and you know
it is kind of dangerous,

4137
01:51:59,310 --> 01:52:00,690
especially the guys that go deep.

4138
01:52:00,750 --> 01:52:02,670
You go the Arnold Schwarzenegger levels,

4139
01:52:02,940 --> 01:52:03,600
you know,

4140
01:52:03,600 --> 01:52:05,770
you know you go to like
pro wrestling levels,

4141
01:52:05,771 --> 01:52:07,500
re those giant fucking dudes.

4142
01:52:07,710 --> 01:52:08,850
That's dangerous as fuck.

4143
01:52:08,880 --> 01:52:09,241
Like you're,

4144
01:52:09,241 --> 01:52:09,511
you're,

4145
01:52:09,511 --> 01:52:10,770
you're really overclocking.

4146
01:52:12,280 --> 01:52:12,790
It's true.

4147
01:52:12,790 --> 01:52:14,040
60 [inaudible] he's still here.

4148
01:52:14,100 --> 01:52:14,380
Yeah,

4149
01:52:14,380 --> 01:52:14,600
true.

4150
01:52:14,600 --> 01:52:17,280
For him being he also
guys open heart surgery,

4151
01:52:17,281 --> 01:52:17,420
right?

4152
01:52:17,420 --> 01:52:17,470
I,

4153
01:52:17,470 --> 01:52:18,740
but there's 10 guys that the gun,

4154
01:52:19,130 --> 01:52:19,371
it's true.

4155
01:52:19,371 --> 01:52:20,490
Every time you listen to it.

4156
01:52:20,570 --> 01:52:22,130
Anytime you'd do a bump of cocaine,

4157
01:52:22,400 --> 01:52:23,270
a mushroom,

4158
01:52:23,510 --> 01:52:25,130
a fucking five hour energy,

4159
01:52:25,370 --> 01:52:26,151
a steroid,

4160
01:52:26,151 --> 01:52:26,660
you always,

4161
01:52:26,660 --> 01:52:27,980
you always gone in that area.

4162
01:52:28,340 --> 01:52:31,400
You're always 55th
coaching to buy anything.

4163
01:52:31,490 --> 01:52:32,420
You're pushing them body.

4164
01:52:32,421 --> 01:52:33,200
So yeah,

4165
01:52:33,200 --> 01:52:35,420
maybe 50% 50% of that would do it.

4166
01:52:35,421 --> 01:52:36,110
How many times?

4167
01:52:36,110 --> 01:52:37,340
I did coke for 30 years.

4168
01:52:37,341 --> 01:52:40,490
The basketball player pushes Boston
the line and had a heart attack.

4169
01:52:40,850 --> 01:52:41,601
We're all different.

4170
01:52:41,601 --> 01:52:42,421
You say it the best.

4171
01:52:42,421 --> 01:52:43,130
Some guy,

4172
01:52:43,130 --> 01:52:44,930
the Georges has a certain number.

4173
01:52:45,020 --> 01:52:45,620
Yup.

4174
01:52:45,620 --> 01:52:46,070
The head

4175
01:52:46,070 --> 01:52:47,150
just has a certain number.

4176
01:52:47,151 --> 01:52:50,450
It could be five shots to the head to
get brain or it could be a hundred and

4177
01:52:50,451 --> 01:52:51,284
fucking,

4178
01:52:51,430 --> 01:52:52,700
it depends on if you're Samoan.

4179
01:52:53,240 --> 01:52:54,680
Well it depends on anything.

4180
01:52:54,710 --> 01:52:55,820
We don't know that number,

4181
01:52:56,030 --> 01:52:59,760
but once you get to the
steroids or whatever,

4182
01:52:59,930 --> 01:53:00,860
any of that shit.

4183
01:53:01,500 --> 01:53:01,850
Yeah,

4184
01:53:01,850 --> 01:53:02,683
it's true.

4185
01:53:02,750 --> 01:53:03,110
Yeah,

4186
01:53:03,110 --> 01:53:03,531
it's all,

4187
01:53:03,531 --> 01:53:04,364
look,

4188
01:53:04,400 --> 01:53:05,870
I'm a personal freedom person,

4189
01:53:06,020 --> 01:53:07,430
but I also think that man,

4190
01:53:07,431 --> 01:53:08,990
if a kid wants to be a cyclist,

4191
01:53:08,991 --> 01:53:11,420
he shouldn't have to take some
shit that might give them a stroke.

4192
01:53:11,750 --> 01:53:12,770
And the only way to win,

4193
01:53:12,800 --> 01:53:14,840
if you're going to have a
bunch of dudes were an EPO,

4194
01:53:14,841 --> 01:53:16,370
an EPO can give you strokes.

4195
01:53:16,580 --> 01:53:18,590
I don't know how many
people have died from it,

4196
01:53:18,591 --> 01:53:21,740
but I assume it's gotta be
a few and it is dangerous.

4197
01:53:21,741 --> 01:53:23,150
I know people that have told me,

4198
01:53:23,151 --> 01:53:24,470
they know people who took it.

4199
01:53:24,650 --> 01:53:27,470
You know the guys that are professional
cyclist and they detailed how difficult

4200
01:53:27,471 --> 01:53:30,950
and dangerous it was and how they would
have to wake up in the middle of the

4201
01:53:30,950 --> 01:53:32,120
night and do cardio.

4202
01:53:32,240 --> 01:53:35,060
They would have to get up and go ride
their bike because their heart would be

4203
01:53:35,061 --> 01:53:36,280
fucking pounding because their,

4204
01:53:36,281 --> 01:53:39,440
their blood is too thick because they
have all this shit in their body that

4205
01:53:39,441 --> 01:53:40,290
makes them make an,

4206
01:53:40,400 --> 01:53:42,350
an abnormal amount of red blood cells.

4207
01:53:42,620 --> 01:53:44,810
So on the plus side you
carry all this oxygen.

4208
01:53:44,811 --> 01:53:45,621
But on the downside,

4209
01:53:45,621 --> 01:53:45,741
man,

4210
01:53:45,741 --> 01:53:48,320
if you don't work out all
the time and you could die,

4211
01:53:48,540 --> 01:53:50,390
like you could have a fucking stroke man,

4212
01:53:50,690 --> 01:53:51,380
these dudes would,

4213
01:53:51,380 --> 01:53:53,030
he was a cyclist and he was staying on a,

4214
01:53:53,031 --> 01:53:55,100
on a bus and he said you
would hear him at two,

4215
01:53:55,101 --> 01:53:58,130
three in the morning and you would know
who was on EPO cause those are the guys

4216
01:53:58,131 --> 01:53:59,150
who would get up and they would,

4217
01:53:59,151 --> 01:54:00,110
and you would hear their bike,

4218
01:54:00,140 --> 01:54:03,410
you'd hear them disconnect their bike
and go Rodan till three in the morning,

4219
01:54:03,411 --> 01:54:03,830
man,

4220
01:54:03,830 --> 01:54:04,550
they had to do it.

4221
01:54:04,550 --> 01:54:05,061
If you don't do it,

4222
01:54:05,061 --> 01:54:05,810
you're gonna die.

4223
01:54:05,810 --> 01:54:07,430
So in on one hand,

4224
01:54:07,490 --> 01:54:08,810
I believe in personal freedom.

4225
01:54:08,840 --> 01:54:09,770
Then another hand I go,

4226
01:54:09,771 --> 01:54:12,410
well you know you got to let people
know what the fuck you're doing.

4227
01:54:12,560 --> 01:54:15,860
You can't make it so that the only the
guys at the top are taking the shit in

4228
01:54:15,861 --> 01:54:16,850
line about taking it.

4229
01:54:16,970 --> 01:54:18,830
That does become a problem if you say,

4230
01:54:18,831 --> 01:54:19,191
hey look,

4231
01:54:19,191 --> 01:54:19,851
we all take it.

4232
01:54:19,851 --> 01:54:20,621
Everybody takes it.

4233
01:54:20,621 --> 01:54:24,170
It's a part of the world of cyclists
and it's been there forever.

4234
01:54:24,830 --> 01:54:27,020
Then expose light on it and then
you've got to figure out what,

4235
01:54:27,021 --> 01:54:28,400
if anything you can do about it.

4236
01:54:28,700 --> 01:54:30,620
But it is a dangerous thing.

4237
01:54:30,830 --> 01:54:31,041
You know,

4238
01:54:31,041 --> 01:54:31,260
you're,

4239
01:54:31,260 --> 01:54:35,060
you're telling kids that want to be
athletes that they have to do this shit.

4240
01:54:35,710 --> 01:54:35,960
You know,

4241
01:54:35,960 --> 01:54:39,560
there's no way around it and be
professional sport today there's gotta be

4242
01:54:39,561 --> 01:54:41,960
something involved or supreme genetics.

4243
01:54:42,560 --> 01:54:44,100
You can have a guy like Jon Jones,

4244
01:54:45,320 --> 01:54:47,990
magnificent genetics and
he doesn't need anything.

4245
01:54:48,140 --> 01:54:48,741
Or you know,

4246
01:54:48,741 --> 01:54:50,270
there's other guys that
are built like that too.

4247
01:54:50,330 --> 01:54:51,260
Or you know,

4248
01:54:51,320 --> 01:54:52,060
or similar,

4249
01:54:52,060 --> 01:54:52,310
you know,

4250
01:54:52,310 --> 01:54:52,911
there's a lot of guys,

4251
01:54:52,911 --> 01:54:53,750
you don't need anything.

4252
01:54:53,920 --> 01:54:55,060
They just have awesome genetic,

4253
01:54:55,061 --> 01:54:57,470
I don't care what you do as long
as you're a professional athlete.

4254
01:54:57,471 --> 01:54:59,660
I know the stresses of being
a professional athlete,

4255
01:54:59,990 --> 01:55:02,160
especially football bat one should there,

4256
01:55:03,040 --> 01:55:04,190
the pressure is amazing.

4257
01:55:04,191 --> 01:55:05,420
Every year that rook and people,

4258
01:55:05,421 --> 01:55:08,100
even in the UFC now watch
ramp pays the other night.

4259
01:55:08,360 --> 01:55:11,360
But then you got my man Rick story than
other young kid to the company in the

4260
01:55:11,361 --> 01:55:13,100
UFC that 20 and a half away,

4261
01:55:13,101 --> 01:55:13,820
whatever.

4262
01:55:13,820 --> 01:55:14,091
You know,

4263
01:55:14,091 --> 01:55:15,530
people come on every once in a while,

4264
01:55:15,650 --> 01:55:18,830
but also kids had come in
that pop that piss hot,

4265
01:55:19,100 --> 01:55:21,800
they get rid of them right away
about pissing holiday anything.

4266
01:55:21,830 --> 01:55:26,030
What I'm saying is that it's very tough
to not want to stay at your sharpest,

4267
01:55:26,270 --> 01:55:28,160
but if you do steroids
against what you did,

4268
01:55:28,161 --> 01:55:28,994
steroids,

4269
01:55:29,060 --> 01:55:30,200
there's no way are we tracking them.

4270
01:55:30,201 --> 01:55:31,070
So do me a favor.

4271
01:55:31,280 --> 01:55:33,980
Figure out a way that when you
make that first fucking statement,

4272
01:55:33,981 --> 01:55:37,010
you can edit it instead of
dragging off the fucking 10 years.

4273
01:55:37,500 --> 01:55:38,271
What are you going to say?

4274
01:55:38,271 --> 01:55:39,140
You got to say nothing.

4275
01:55:39,141 --> 01:55:43,440
Don't hit me with a story that you guys
shot him into yarn because I'm too for

4276
01:55:43,441 --> 01:55:44,060
that one.

4277
01:55:44,060 --> 01:55:47,500
Told me anything but don't tell me that
and that's what I'm sick of right now at

4278
01:55:47,510 --> 01:55:48,343
this point in my life.

4279
01:55:48,600 --> 01:55:49,261
Tell me something.

4280
01:55:49,261 --> 01:55:50,011
Don't hide.

4281
01:55:50,011 --> 01:55:50,844
Don't get the prep.

4282
01:55:51,030 --> 01:55:51,421
You know what?

4283
01:55:51,421 --> 01:55:52,254
You got busted.

4284
01:55:52,380 --> 01:55:53,940
Get the fucking cameras and let's go.

4285
01:55:54,240 --> 01:55:54,600
That's cool.

4286
01:55:54,600 --> 01:55:56,670
Y'All silver had some nonhuman pis.

4287
01:55:56,810 --> 01:55:57,361
Oh please.

4288
01:55:57,361 --> 01:55:58,350
I'm what the fuck the showing up.

4289
01:55:58,351 --> 01:55:59,450
We're pissed on Brazil.

4290
01:55:59,490 --> 01:56:00,090
Kevin Random.

4291
01:56:00,090 --> 01:56:01,160
It was the first guy to do that.

4292
01:56:01,170 --> 01:56:01,721
Kevin ran one,

4293
01:56:01,721 --> 01:56:02,554
had a rubber Dick.

4294
01:56:02,580 --> 01:56:03,420
He used a rubber deck.

4295
01:56:03,500 --> 01:56:05,340
Any really non human urine.

4296
01:56:07,020 --> 01:56:07,291
Ben,

4297
01:56:07,291 --> 01:56:08,520
have you heard anything from him lately?

4298
01:56:08,550 --> 01:56:09,450
He's kind of retired,

4299
01:56:09,770 --> 01:56:10,710
fought recently.

4300
01:56:10,740 --> 01:56:12,270
Real recently in the last,

4301
01:56:12,360 --> 01:56:14,790
I love people who think they're
going to be the urine test.

4302
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:16,710
I just want to be great
to those fucking clowns.

4303
01:56:16,770 --> 01:56:17,880
Kevin Randleman was awesome.

4304
01:56:18,490 --> 01:56:21,180
I love those fucking clowns
because I was with them.

4305
01:56:21,570 --> 01:56:23,970
I always thought I was a
little bit beat the system.

4306
01:56:24,180 --> 01:56:25,380
I used to drink vinegar,

4307
01:56:26,040 --> 01:56:26,851
that would be it.

4308
01:56:26,851 --> 01:56:29,550
So I would snort coke
Friday and Saturday night.

4309
01:56:30,210 --> 01:56:31,043
Listen to me,

4310
01:56:31,080 --> 01:56:31,913
listen to me,

4311
01:56:32,130 --> 01:56:34,260
listen to what addiction
does or any level.

4312
01:56:34,290 --> 01:56:34,770
God,

4313
01:56:34,770 --> 01:56:38,700
I used to do an eight ball on Friday
ball on Saturday and then they would have

4314
01:56:38,701 --> 01:56:42,360
to test me on Monday for federal
probation or Wednesday or Friday.

4315
01:56:43,050 --> 01:56:44,760
I could make the Piss test Wednesday,

4316
01:56:44,790 --> 01:56:48,540
but there's no way I can make this
rock candy coming out his deck.

4317
01:56:48,780 --> 01:56:51,310
I would fucking vinegar
flavored rock candy,

4318
01:56:51,370 --> 01:56:56,040
go and get white distilled vinegar
with a bottle of Gatorade and I'd be

4319
01:56:56,240 --> 01:56:56,910
cranberries,

4320
01:56:56,910 --> 01:56:57,743
but be,

4321
01:56:58,560 --> 01:57:00,180
I drink the whole thing of vinegar,

4322
01:57:00,240 --> 01:57:01,010
the whole thing again.

4323
01:57:01,010 --> 01:57:02,320
The rape kiss all day come.

4324
01:57:02,321 --> 01:57:03,390
Where did you learn this?

4325
01:57:03,391 --> 01:57:04,410
This is the stories on this.

4326
01:57:04,411 --> 01:57:06,850
This is all the analogies you
learned from people in your read.

4327
01:57:06,900 --> 01:57:08,310
That time there was no Internet Joe,

4328
01:57:08,430 --> 01:57:08,640
right?

4329
01:57:08,640 --> 01:57:10,550
So then I failed actor,

4330
01:57:11,740 --> 01:57:13,320
then I came up with another idea.

4331
01:57:13,321 --> 01:57:13,870
I must do it.

4332
01:57:13,870 --> 01:57:15,420
And so how many days had it been?

4333
01:57:15,421 --> 01:57:15,721
You did.

4334
01:57:15,721 --> 01:57:18,840
You did coke Friday and said if you do
coke on a Friday and you have a test on a

4335
01:57:18,841 --> 01:57:19,201
Monday,

4336
01:57:19,201 --> 01:57:20,034
you're going down.

4337
01:57:20,460 --> 01:57:22,020
But if you wait till Wednesday,

4338
01:57:22,021 --> 01:57:22,854
you're good.

4339
01:57:23,430 --> 01:57:24,061
Two hours,

4340
01:57:24,061 --> 01:57:27,390
70 to 72 hours and you can't flush
it out at some can't flush that.

4341
01:57:27,391 --> 01:57:29,310
Some magnetic fucking correlation.

4342
01:57:29,340 --> 01:57:31,410
Weed is 30 days.

4343
01:57:31,560 --> 01:57:34,020
But if you keep your normal level,

4344
01:57:34,200 --> 01:57:36,960
like if you just hit two hits
off a joint and go to a gym,

4345
01:57:37,080 --> 01:57:37,861
I did a dog,

4346
01:57:37,861 --> 01:57:38,950
they won't catch it real.

4347
01:57:39,040 --> 01:57:40,620
It can't be nothing in your system.

4348
01:57:40,890 --> 01:57:42,090
You can't show up now.

4349
01:57:42,091 --> 01:57:42,630
And then a month.

4350
01:57:42,630 --> 01:57:42,791
No,

4351
01:57:42,791 --> 01:57:42,880
no,

4352
01:57:42,880 --> 01:57:43,350
no.

4353
01:57:43,350 --> 01:57:43,951
I can go.

4354
01:57:43,951 --> 01:57:45,820
If at that time all I needed,

4355
01:57:45,840 --> 01:57:46,920
we was to go to the gym.

4356
01:57:46,950 --> 01:57:48,480
How do you think Nick Diaz is doing it?

4357
01:57:48,870 --> 01:57:49,590
He dog.

4358
01:57:49,590 --> 01:57:50,620
He wrestles every,

4359
01:57:50,700 --> 01:57:51,780
you do Jiu Jitsu every day.

4360
01:57:51,810 --> 01:57:54,970
Just sweat Sadie and not do 50
bucks enough fat to a story.

4361
01:57:55,020 --> 01:57:56,460
CanNot do 50 bond hits,

4362
01:57:56,461 --> 01:57:58,590
but you could do to bond gets
and keep it under the level.

4363
01:57:58,620 --> 01:58:00,180
Nick did a lot of bagels.

4364
01:58:00,420 --> 01:58:01,021
I do whatever,

4365
01:58:01,021 --> 01:58:02,310
but holds on about Nick Diaz.

4366
01:58:02,340 --> 01:58:03,720
Forget about Nancy poppy seeds.

4367
01:58:03,721 --> 01:58:05,420
So that's for heroin.

4368
01:58:05,421 --> 01:58:06,300
So that's a different thing.

4369
01:58:07,120 --> 01:58:08,970
But take it to the point where those days,

4370
01:58:09,240 --> 01:58:12,160
what's the funny thing was I figured
I'm smarter than these motherfuckers.

4371
01:58:12,210 --> 01:58:13,140
Forget about drinking.

4372
01:58:13,530 --> 01:58:17,190
I'm going to take my own circumcised
Dick and I'm gonna pull the skin back and

4373
01:58:17,191 --> 01:58:18,920
I'm going to put byproducts in there.

4374
01:58:20,610 --> 01:58:21,443
Sit down,

4375
01:58:21,810 --> 01:58:22,800
sit out bitch.

4376
01:58:22,801 --> 01:58:23,181
Cause you don't,

4377
01:58:23,181 --> 01:58:28,181
what about Joey Diaz Circa 1987
I would have to go in my mind.

4378
01:58:29,851 --> 01:58:31,500
I thought it out and I said to myself,

4379
01:58:31,501 --> 01:58:33,870
what kills piss on contact.

4380
01:58:34,300 --> 01:58:35,180
Got Clorox.

4381
01:58:35,190 --> 01:58:36,690
But I can't sneak that into money.

4382
01:58:37,590 --> 01:58:38,131
So I said,

4383
01:58:38,131 --> 01:58:40,110
what's the next best thing to kill pissed?

4384
01:58:40,380 --> 01:58:41,850
So I figured out pool cleaners,

4385
01:58:42,460 --> 01:58:43,293
right?

4386
01:58:43,690 --> 01:58:45,640
So I went to my buddy's
house who had a pool,

4387
01:58:45,670 --> 01:58:46,930
you know those big things that he'd say,

4388
01:58:46,931 --> 01:58:47,780
oh no,

4389
01:58:47,870 --> 01:58:52,810
Maureen and I grind it that I
like rather that motherfucker.

4390
01:58:53,200 --> 01:58:57,790
I grinded that motherfucker like a fucking
grab a blow to a powder and I took my

4391
01:58:57,791 --> 01:59:01,870
little skin on my helmet and I pulled
my dick back before I went to probation

4392
01:59:02,110 --> 01:59:03,270
and I did my dick in.

4393
01:59:03,320 --> 01:59:05,230
It didn't hurt and I just pull it all the,

4394
01:59:05,620 --> 01:59:07,330
the whole fucking thing on my dick.

4395
01:59:08,880 --> 01:59:12,150
And I pulled the skin over
and I like a rubber band that

4396
01:59:15,340 --> 01:59:17,080
this is what addiction makes you do,

4397
01:59:17,081 --> 01:59:17,914
Brian.

4398
01:59:18,160 --> 01:59:19,670
I walk into probation,

4399
01:59:20,370 --> 01:59:21,310
ready a Piss,

4400
01:59:21,410 --> 01:59:26,410
Mr. I take that Dick out and I popped
that skin back and all of that volcano bus

4401
01:59:26,831 --> 01:59:30,010
goes in there and that thing
starts breathing on his own booboo,

4402
01:59:30,030 --> 01:59:30,190
blah,

4403
01:59:30,190 --> 01:59:31,023
blah.

4404
01:59:31,060 --> 01:59:31,990
I put the cap on it.

4405
01:59:31,991 --> 01:59:34,300
The thing is on his desk and
you could see it in my fucking,

4406
01:59:34,510 --> 01:59:35,290
we've,

4407
01:59:35,290 --> 01:59:36,610
you could see it like shaking.

4408
01:59:36,611 --> 01:59:37,444
I'm like,

4409
01:59:37,600 --> 01:59:37,750
oh,

4410
01:59:37,750 --> 01:59:38,583
great to see you.

4411
01:59:39,610 --> 01:59:40,443
Do you know what bitch,

4412
01:59:40,450 --> 01:59:41,800
I still came back positive.

4413
01:59:42,760 --> 01:59:44,230
Now here's the clinker,

4414
01:59:44,500 --> 01:59:45,280
the clinker.

4415
01:59:45,280 --> 01:59:47,230
This is when you know
you're fucking crazy.

4416
01:59:47,920 --> 01:59:51,820
Then the last thing I figured
was Draino I'll take drain,

4417
01:59:51,950 --> 01:59:52,783
but this was the,

4418
01:59:52,840 --> 01:59:53,673
you were drinking.

4419
01:59:53,740 --> 01:59:53,960
No.

4420
01:59:53,960 --> 01:59:56,570
Can't they detect who?

4421
01:59:56,700 --> 01:59:58,180
Listen to me now listen to me.

4422
01:59:58,450 --> 02:00:00,160
The chlorine the next day didn't hurt.

4423
02:00:00,161 --> 02:00:02,410
I went right to the halfway
house on wash my dick off,

4424
02:00:02,740 --> 02:00:05,380
but the next day I went to Piss
and my dick was like one of those.

4425
02:00:06,760 --> 02:00:08,110
This was coming out of everywhere.

4426
02:00:10,060 --> 02:00:10,541
But yeah,

4427
02:00:10,541 --> 02:00:11,230
I had like,

4428
02:00:11,230 --> 02:00:12,100
it would just broke.

4429
02:00:12,130 --> 02:00:13,210
It was like a fucking thing.

4430
02:00:14,140 --> 02:00:16,880
I came back for that one little holes.

4431
02:00:16,920 --> 02:00:18,220
It burnt right to my helmet.

4432
02:00:18,280 --> 02:00:19,300
Oh my God.

4433
02:00:19,540 --> 02:00:20,373
At this point,

4434
02:00:20,420 --> 02:00:22,420
fucking Britain on the blow Jack.

4435
02:00:22,540 --> 02:00:22,901
Oh my.

4436
02:00:22,901 --> 02:00:24,160
So I came back positive.

4437
02:00:24,161 --> 02:00:27,460
They made me go to rehab
that time or a check in,

4438
02:00:27,461 --> 02:00:30,730
but one that you give them a grant and
you go three to six and you signed papers

4439
02:00:30,731 --> 02:00:32,830
and Elizabeth Therapy,

4440
02:00:32,831 --> 02:00:33,551
here's 20 bucks.

4441
02:00:33,551 --> 02:00:34,260
I'll be back on that.

4442
02:00:34,260 --> 02:00:34,590
And nobody,

4443
02:00:34,590 --> 02:00:35,090
even the folks,

4444
02:00:35,090 --> 02:00:37,450
they just want that grand
up front and that's it.

4445
02:00:37,451 --> 02:00:37,870
You don't need,

4446
02:00:37,870 --> 02:00:38,990
that's what we have is you don't,

4447
02:00:39,020 --> 02:00:39,640
at that time,

4448
02:00:39,640 --> 02:00:40,411
this was boulder.

4449
02:00:40,411 --> 02:00:42,070
This is 1800 bucks.

4450
02:00:42,071 --> 02:00:43,390
I got a grant from the state.

4451
02:00:43,750 --> 02:00:45,810
It cost me 400 but it kept
me out of jail for it.

4452
02:00:45,820 --> 02:00:47,080
So you don't have to actually be there.

4453
02:00:47,200 --> 02:00:48,970
Now you just go from
three to six at night.

4454
02:00:48,971 --> 02:00:50,050
You tell him you got a day job.

4455
02:00:50,080 --> 02:00:50,920
It was tremendous.

4456
02:00:51,250 --> 02:00:54,160
So this last time they
get me again for blow.

4457
02:00:54,190 --> 02:00:55,660
I know they're going to fucking sick me.

4458
02:00:55,661 --> 02:00:56,471
So this time I said,

4459
02:00:56,471 --> 02:00:56,831
fuck it.

4460
02:00:56,831 --> 02:00:58,870
I'm going to plan the one I heard,

4461
02:00:58,871 --> 02:01:01,320
I heard Draino so I took drain on.

4462
02:01:01,330 --> 02:01:04,570
I pulled it off my dick
go home and I went down.

4463
02:01:04,571 --> 02:01:07,300
Eric Gad fucking pissed with the drain.

4464
02:01:07,301 --> 02:01:07,540
Okay.

4465
02:01:07,540 --> 02:01:08,650
And this time dog,

4466
02:01:08,651 --> 02:01:10,780
that thing was turning
red right in front of me.

4467
02:01:11,140 --> 02:01:15,370
You could see the thing going up and
down is the pis and about four days late,

4468
02:01:15,371 --> 02:01:16,204
I get a call.

4469
02:01:16,570 --> 02:01:17,201
Mr. Diaz,

4470
02:01:17,201 --> 02:01:18,460
can you come down to probation?

4471
02:01:18,490 --> 02:01:20,380
I had to throw going to
handcuff me a probation.

4472
02:01:20,381 --> 02:01:22,170
I get there and as a car does it,

4473
02:01:22,171 --> 02:01:23,800
probation loss and the
gang got in the check.

4474
02:01:23,801 --> 02:01:24,970
There was a chick that really liked me.

4475
02:01:24,971 --> 02:01:25,804
She goes,

4476
02:01:25,840 --> 02:01:26,591
I don't know what you did,

4477
02:01:26,591 --> 02:01:28,630
but you fucking broke
the machine this time.

4478
02:01:29,050 --> 02:01:32,080
I really literally broke
the testing thing they had.

4479
02:01:32,530 --> 02:01:33,251
They couldn't even,

4480
02:01:33,251 --> 02:01:34,810
they didn't know what was in my system.

4481
02:01:35,200 --> 02:01:37,490
[inaudible]

4482
02:01:38,960 --> 02:01:39,793
I drop her a quick,

4483
02:01:39,860 --> 02:01:40,410
where was the,

4484
02:01:40,410 --> 02:01:41,840
you put the drain on your Dick.

4485
02:01:41,870 --> 02:01:43,000
Oh my God.

4486
02:01:43,001 --> 02:01:44,240
Was calling them possible.

4487
02:01:44,241 --> 02:01:45,440
Doesn't it eat right through your Dick?

4488
02:01:45,441 --> 02:01:48,230
I mean that's during the day before,

4489
02:01:48,310 --> 02:01:48,500
right.

4490
02:01:48,500 --> 02:01:50,710
Just had chlorine the day
before at this planning.

4491
02:01:50,730 --> 02:01:51,590
Give a fuck.

4492
02:01:51,740 --> 02:01:53,570
I was living like a bitch.

4493
02:01:53,990 --> 02:01:54,823
Yo

4494
02:01:56,140 --> 02:01:58,630
dismisses the next day
after you had to Corrine.

4495
02:01:58,930 --> 02:02:00,050
This was about a month later.

4496
02:02:00,610 --> 02:02:01,460
I had sores on there.

4497
02:02:01,461 --> 02:02:03,980
It looked like a fucking bay root
cause you said the day before I got

4498
02:02:04,130 --> 02:02:06,500
[inaudible] but it was
funny that they nailed me.

4499
02:02:06,501 --> 02:02:06,921
They were like,

4500
02:02:06,921 --> 02:02:07,250
Joey,

4501
02:02:07,250 --> 02:02:09,500
we know you have coke but
we can't prove it in court.

4502
02:02:10,470 --> 02:02:11,680
How do they know he had coke done?

4503
02:02:11,690 --> 02:02:12,530
Because whatever.

4504
02:02:12,531 --> 02:02:15,830
I had in my broke the fucking drink.

4505
02:02:15,860 --> 02:02:18,990
You sure it was real drain cause I know
I was running from the fucking flea

4506
02:02:18,991 --> 02:02:19,311
market.

4507
02:02:19,311 --> 02:02:19,521
Yeah,

4508
02:02:19,521 --> 02:02:20,470
it was real fucking drain.

4509
02:02:20,680 --> 02:02:25,100
I think draino like it could
sound like a Chi Empire.

4510
02:02:25,910 --> 02:02:26,870
My fucking helmet,

4511
02:02:27,200 --> 02:02:30,310
his girlfriend and clogged his
girlfriend split or something dog.

4512
02:02:30,320 --> 02:02:32,180
My Dick was rare for a fucking month.

4513
02:02:32,600 --> 02:02:33,920
Let's not get away with this shit.

4514
02:02:34,400 --> 02:02:35,233
It was rather,

4515
02:02:35,240 --> 02:02:38,020
you know when you pee and it goes on get
help and it would stick with me and he

4516
02:02:38,030 --> 02:02:39,080
brought it on a Thursday.

4517
02:02:39,110 --> 02:02:39,860
That's how sick.

4518
02:02:39,860 --> 02:02:41,540
That's how bad the stick of this was.

4519
02:02:42,230 --> 02:02:42,370
Your

4520
02:02:42,370 --> 02:02:43,880
life is when your dick a sore.

4521
02:02:44,030 --> 02:02:45,030
There's something wrong with your dad.

4522
02:02:45,031 --> 02:02:45,451
He realize,

4523
02:02:45,451 --> 02:02:46,284
what have I done?

4524
02:02:46,480 --> 02:02:47,480
The fuck is wrong with me.

4525
02:02:47,740 --> 02:02:50,370
Crazy off till I got blisters on my feet.

4526
02:02:50,450 --> 02:02:52,360
Dog Find that like three times in my life.

4527
02:02:52,430 --> 02:02:53,263
All the time.

4528
02:02:53,970 --> 02:02:57,410
Fucking the other day I scraped my nail
against my dick and then fucking start

4529
02:02:57,411 --> 02:02:57,920
bleeding.

4530
02:02:57,920 --> 02:02:58,753
It's discussed.

4531
02:02:59,970 --> 02:03:02,270
What's the latest with
Joe Eddie Bravo fighting?

4532
02:03:02,330 --> 02:03:03,163
Uh,

4533
02:03:03,610 --> 02:03:04,820
it's off completely off.

4534
02:03:05,360 --> 02:03:06,260
The dude wants money.

4535
02:03:06,261 --> 02:03:07,940
He wants a $50,000.

4536
02:03:08,250 --> 02:03:09,110
We agreed to the fight,

4537
02:03:09,111 --> 02:03:12,200
but then he said he wants $50,000
and then 25,000 if he wins.

4538
02:03:12,410 --> 02:03:14,300
So apparently the shake talked moon,

4539
02:03:14,301 --> 02:03:16,210
whoever was putting together
one of the shakes over there,

4540
02:03:16,230 --> 02:03:16,611
not put dollar.

4541
02:03:16,611 --> 02:03:17,444
He was like,

4542
02:03:17,870 --> 02:03:18,501
you can't do that,

4543
02:03:18,501 --> 02:03:18,830
dude.

4544
02:03:18,830 --> 02:03:19,970
You're asking for too much money.

4545
02:03:20,750 --> 02:03:21,320
But who knows?

4546
02:03:21,320 --> 02:03:21,740
They might.

4547
02:03:21,740 --> 02:03:23,180
They might come to some
sort of an agreement.

4548
02:03:23,210 --> 02:03:24,770
I think Horley is 45 years old,

4549
02:03:24,771 --> 02:03:24,950
man.

4550
02:03:24,950 --> 02:03:25,580
You know,

4551
02:03:25,580 --> 02:03:26,810
it's tough to get that due to fight.

4552
02:03:26,811 --> 02:03:27,411
If he's going to fight,

4553
02:03:27,411 --> 02:03:28,200
he wants some cash.

4554
02:03:28,200 --> 02:03:30,040
Isn't Eddie just then
fight that best grade?

4555
02:03:30,110 --> 02:03:32,990
It's not that would fight him because
he doesn't really want to fight anybody.

4556
02:03:33,020 --> 02:03:35,900
He just was going to fight this dude
because this dude's always saying that him

4557
02:03:35,901 --> 02:03:37,940
beating him was a fluke and then it was,

4558
02:03:37,941 --> 02:03:38,990
it would never happen again.

4559
02:03:38,991 --> 02:03:40,910
Lightning doesn't strike
twice and he's like,

4560
02:03:40,940 --> 02:03:41,121
oh,

4561
02:03:41,121 --> 02:03:41,421
okay.

4562
02:03:41,421 --> 02:03:41,781
Really?

4563
02:03:41,781 --> 02:03:42,614
Well let's do it again.

4564
02:03:42,710 --> 02:03:44,780
I'll tell you the reality
is Eddie's better.

4565
02:03:44,960 --> 02:03:46,910
I don't know if boilers
better than he was back then,

4566
02:03:46,911 --> 02:03:49,910
whether it's an all time great and was
beating Eddie before he tapped him.

4567
02:03:50,050 --> 02:03:50,310
Right.

4568
02:03:50,310 --> 02:03:51,143
But I don't know,

4569
02:03:51,320 --> 02:03:51,600
you know,

4570
02:03:51,600 --> 02:03:53,120
a boiler consistently improves.

4571
02:03:53,121 --> 02:03:54,560
I don't know if he still
has the passion for it,

4572
02:03:54,770 --> 02:03:57,230
but I know Eddie is a lot
better than it was back then.

4573
02:03:57,310 --> 02:03:59,060
It doesn't mean he would win quite grace.

4574
02:03:59,061 --> 02:04:00,380
He's a bad motherfucker dude.

4575
02:04:00,381 --> 02:04:01,910
I mean he won a ton of tournaments.

4576
02:04:01,911 --> 02:04:03,440
He won Abu Dhabi several times.

4577
02:04:03,650 --> 02:04:06,350
He's one of the most active
members of the Gracie family.

4578
02:04:06,470 --> 02:04:09,860
Like he was the guy that was holding it
down for the Gracie family in Jujitsu

4579
02:04:09,861 --> 02:04:10,580
tournament.

4580
02:04:10,580 --> 02:04:10,791
You know,

4581
02:04:10,791 --> 02:04:13,880
back when Hixon wasn't competing anymore
and Hickson was always the greatest.

4582
02:04:13,881 --> 02:04:14,840
Everybody always says that.

4583
02:04:15,080 --> 02:04:17,420
But hoist was doing the
UFC for a little bit.

4584
02:04:17,421 --> 02:04:18,890
But as far as like straight Jujitsu,

4585
02:04:18,891 --> 02:04:20,150
fighting the best in the world,

4586
02:04:20,390 --> 02:04:22,880
oil or Gracie was holding
it down for years,

4587
02:04:22,881 --> 02:04:23,151
man.

4588
02:04:23,151 --> 02:04:23,990
And he was the man.

4589
02:04:23,991 --> 02:04:25,070
He was beating everybody.

4590
02:04:25,370 --> 02:04:26,210
So you know,

4591
02:04:26,240 --> 02:04:28,760
it was a big upset when Eddie
tapped him and you know,

4592
02:04:28,790 --> 02:04:29,601
it was embarrassing,

4593
02:04:29,601 --> 02:04:30,021
I'm sure.

4594
02:04:30,021 --> 02:04:33,830
And he doesn't like it and I'm sure he
doesn't want to have a repeat of that for

4595
02:04:33,831 --> 02:04:34,550
nothing,

4596
02:04:34,550 --> 02:04:35,001
you know?

4597
02:04:35,001 --> 02:04:36,920
And when he wants to get
paid and if he beats him,

4598
02:04:37,050 --> 02:04:37,621
he wants to,

4599
02:04:37,621 --> 02:04:37,980
you know,

4600
02:04:37,980 --> 02:04:41,040
and once I get motivated to work
out to beat him and for Eddie,

4601
02:04:41,760 --> 02:04:42,241
Eddie says,

4602
02:04:42,241 --> 02:04:42,421
look,

4603
02:04:42,421 --> 02:04:43,231
I'll fight that guy.

4604
02:04:43,231 --> 02:04:44,160
That's the only guy I want to fight.

4605
02:04:44,370 --> 02:04:45,900
I want to prove to everybody
that wasn't a fluke.

4606
02:04:46,170 --> 02:04:47,190
I think Yeti's better man.

4607
02:04:47,191 --> 02:04:48,600
He's way better than he was back then.

4608
02:04:48,660 --> 02:04:48,901
I don't,

4609
02:04:48,901 --> 02:04:50,850
I'm not saying he's better
than a boiler still.

4610
02:04:50,851 --> 02:04:51,570
Like I said,

4611
02:04:51,570 --> 02:04:52,470
I'll respect the heuler.

4612
02:04:52,471 --> 02:04:53,370
He's an all time great,

4613
02:04:53,550 --> 02:04:55,980
but I know that Eddie's a lot better
than he was when he beat him last time.

4614
02:04:56,100 --> 02:04:58,050
People go in there like just like,

4615
02:04:58,170 --> 02:04:58,580
I don't always,

4616
02:04:58,580 --> 02:04:59,413
students love him,

4617
02:04:59,970 --> 02:05:01,800
but people go there for a couple of days.

4618
02:05:01,801 --> 02:05:03,660
We'll come back with that say bro.

4619
02:05:03,720 --> 02:05:04,800
And he's bare to the bone.

4620
02:05:04,830 --> 02:05:05,101
Yeah,

4621
02:05:05,101 --> 02:05:05,671
you take the,

4622
02:05:05,671 --> 02:05:06,900
you know his guard ain't shit.

4623
02:05:06,930 --> 02:05:08,730
He's going to wrap you
up and fuck you up dude.

4624
02:05:08,731 --> 02:05:11,070
Even if you're a lot bigger than he tell
you the whole story about what he went

4625
02:05:11,071 --> 02:05:13,560
over there and I would Dobbin
weight train with the guy,

4626
02:05:13,561 --> 02:05:16,380
but the guys trainer was a hen's old guy.

4627
02:05:16,830 --> 02:05:17,191
Yeah,

4628
02:05:17,191 --> 02:05:17,700
the whole story.

4629
02:05:17,700 --> 02:05:18,301
Very interesting.

4630
02:05:18,301 --> 02:05:19,134
Yeah it is.

4631
02:05:19,670 --> 02:05:20,920
I slowed down that.

4632
02:05:20,921 --> 02:05:21,820
It's a bad motherfucker.

4633
02:05:22,140 --> 02:05:23,370
Eddie's a Jujitsu genius.

4634
02:05:23,400 --> 02:05:24,210
I've always said this,

4635
02:05:24,210 --> 02:05:24,511
you know,

4636
02:05:24,511 --> 02:05:28,050
he's just a crazy guy and people look at
him and he does all this music and all

4637
02:05:28,051 --> 02:05:29,790
these different things
so they get it twisted.

4638
02:05:30,090 --> 02:05:31,480
But when it comes to straight Jujitsu,

4639
02:05:32,900 --> 02:05:34,430
Nicole Nicole's,

4640
02:05:34,630 --> 02:05:35,460
they can't man,

4641
02:05:35,460 --> 02:05:37,200
he's a great fucking instructor.

4642
02:05:37,230 --> 02:05:37,441
Let's,

4643
02:05:37,441 --> 02:05:38,940
the way he breaks down techniques,

4644
02:05:38,941 --> 02:05:39,960
he's excellent at it,

4645
02:05:39,961 --> 02:05:40,320
man.

4646
02:05:40,320 --> 02:05:44,100
I've been to a lot of UFC is with
you and I've never had a bad time.

4647
02:05:44,160 --> 02:05:49,050
But one of the funniest things beside
this trip and at the UFC was the way and

4648
02:05:49,051 --> 02:05:53,580
would Eddie and what's the kid that I
love him with the fucked up I for a while.

4649
02:05:53,581 --> 02:05:55,590
He's fighting against now big kid,

4650
02:05:55,990 --> 02:05:59,040
one 84 Yak Akiyama and he beat them.

4651
02:05:59,190 --> 02:06:01,890
Akiyama beat him the first
Akiyama his first fight.

4652
02:06:02,460 --> 02:06:03,750
I always forget his name,

4653
02:06:03,751 --> 02:06:04,140
cubs,

4654
02:06:04,140 --> 02:06:04,830
Alan Belcher,

4655
02:06:04,830 --> 02:06:05,663
Alan Belcher.

4656
02:06:05,970 --> 02:06:07,080
So we're hanging out.

4657
02:06:07,400 --> 02:06:08,233
I haven't,

4658
02:06:08,250 --> 02:06:11,060
I forbid I don't go to the front
and the way in the back of my,

4659
02:06:11,080 --> 02:06:11,701
my business,

4660
02:06:11,701 --> 02:06:13,350
I won't say nothing cause
somebody might beat me up.

4661
02:06:14,220 --> 02:06:15,053
They're talking,

4662
02:06:15,510 --> 02:06:16,970
they're talking like the way we are.

4663
02:06:17,520 --> 02:06:18,353
Awesome.

4664
02:06:18,390 --> 02:06:18,721
He goes,

4665
02:06:18,721 --> 02:06:19,190
Bro.

4666
02:06:19,190 --> 02:06:19,531
He goes,

4667
02:06:19,531 --> 02:06:20,250
Bro,

4668
02:06:20,250 --> 02:06:22,800
did you just see my new
technique and Allen Belt?

4669
02:06:22,801 --> 02:06:23,101
Just like,

4670
02:06:23,101 --> 02:06:23,371
no,

4671
02:06:23,371 --> 02:06:23,761
what is it?

4672
02:06:23,761 --> 02:06:24,120
He's like,

4673
02:06:24,120 --> 02:06:24,271
oh,

4674
02:06:24,271 --> 02:06:25,081
it's called this.

4675
02:06:25,081 --> 02:06:28,440
And so like I dunno and the next
thing you know they're on the ground.

4676
02:06:28,680 --> 02:06:29,431
Fuck you.

4677
02:06:29,431 --> 02:06:30,264
They in the ring.

4678
02:06:30,270 --> 02:06:30,800
Yeah,

4679
02:06:30,800 --> 02:06:31,760
bitch dumb in the ring.

4680
02:06:32,030 --> 02:06:34,160
And they got their shoes off and
I was sitting there and I went,

4681
02:06:34,260 --> 02:06:35,400
oh my God.

4682
02:06:35,880 --> 02:06:38,370
And he's just taken Alan Belcher and just,

4683
02:06:38,371 --> 02:06:38,761
you know,

4684
02:06:38,761 --> 02:06:39,930
hooks and legs.

4685
02:06:39,931 --> 02:06:41,340
I don't know what they're called,

4686
02:06:41,640 --> 02:06:44,080
but I know Alan Belcher was blown away in

4687
02:06:46,310 --> 02:06:46,950
golf.

4688
02:06:46,950 --> 02:06:47,340
You know,

4689
02:06:47,340 --> 02:06:48,480
Jujitsu with something that,

4690
02:06:48,481 --> 02:06:48,810
you know,

4691
02:06:48,810 --> 02:06:49,081
Eddie,

4692
02:06:49,081 --> 02:06:52,110
Eddie Bravo would be like one of the
most respected coaches in the country.

4693
02:06:52,130 --> 02:06:53,340
He was a huge,

4694
02:06:53,490 --> 02:06:53,761
you know,

4695
02:06:53,761 --> 02:06:56,370
and I don't think he's a just a golfer,

4696
02:06:56,520 --> 02:06:57,353
I don't think his coach.

4697
02:06:57,780 --> 02:06:58,441
But you know what I'm saying?

4698
02:06:58,441 --> 02:06:58,621
I mean,

4699
02:06:58,621 --> 02:06:59,670
if it was like something that was,

4700
02:07:00,060 --> 02:07:03,000
golf's a terrible example because it's
sort of a game instead of a sport where

4701
02:07:03,001 --> 02:07:03,091
it's,

4702
02:07:03,091 --> 02:07:04,320
Jujitsu is clearly a sport.

4703
02:07:04,800 --> 02:07:05,281
He just,

4704
02:07:05,281 --> 02:07:05,521
uh,

4705
02:07:05,521 --> 02:07:05,970
you know,

4706
02:07:05,970 --> 02:07:06,330
he's,

4707
02:07:06,330 --> 02:07:09,000
he's always wanted to be a musician.

4708
02:07:09,090 --> 02:07:10,080
That's the real problem.

4709
02:07:10,170 --> 02:07:13,040
If he just wanted to only
be a Jujitsu fighter and,

4710
02:07:13,041 --> 02:07:13,181
and,

4711
02:07:13,181 --> 02:07:13,410
and,

4712
02:07:13,410 --> 02:07:14,520
and keep competing,

4713
02:07:14,700 --> 02:07:15,030
you know,

4714
02:07:15,030 --> 02:07:16,620
there's always been
dudes that will beat him.

4715
02:07:16,621 --> 02:07:16,771
You know,

4716
02:07:16,771 --> 02:07:18,720
Havi Vasquez beat him a
few times and this guy,

4717
02:07:18,750 --> 02:07:18,990
I mean,

4718
02:07:18,990 --> 02:07:21,810
Eddie's not the best in the world
because he's not the best athlete,

4719
02:07:22,140 --> 02:07:24,390
but he's a Jujitsu genius man.

4720
02:07:24,450 --> 02:07:25,440
He sees shit.

4721
02:07:25,441 --> 02:07:29,250
He knows how to break shit down and
everybody thinks that he like takes credit

4722
02:07:29,251 --> 02:07:30,210
for all this other shit,

4723
02:07:30,330 --> 02:07:31,860
but he really doesn't,

4724
02:07:31,950 --> 02:07:32,161
you know,

4725
02:07:32,161 --> 02:07:34,890
when you listen to him talk and teach
and actually get to know the guy,

4726
02:07:35,110 --> 02:07:36,190
he gives credit for every

4727
02:07:36,190 --> 02:07:37,900
single person and learned every move from,

4728
02:07:38,200 --> 02:07:38,590
you know,

4729
02:07:38,590 --> 02:07:38,890
he,

4730
02:07:38,890 --> 02:07:39,640
there's certain,

4731
02:07:39,640 --> 02:07:39,851
you know,

4732
02:07:39,851 --> 02:07:41,070
there's a move called the do Dodd.

4733
02:07:41,071 --> 02:07:42,450
This is the John Joc sweep.

4734
02:07:42,460 --> 02:07:44,110
Like he doesn't rename shit.

4735
02:07:44,111 --> 02:07:45,100
That's other people's stuff.

4736
02:07:45,250 --> 02:07:46,510
If you learned it from somebody else,

4737
02:07:46,511 --> 02:07:46,781
man,

4738
02:07:46,781 --> 02:07:47,530
he always,

4739
02:07:47,530 --> 02:07:49,120
he literally call it,

4740
02:07:49,330 --> 02:07:49,541
you know,

4741
02:07:49,541 --> 02:07:50,210
this is a,

4742
02:07:50,210 --> 02:07:51,640
this is what Marcello uses,

4743
02:07:51,641 --> 02:07:52,510
this is the Marcello,

4744
02:07:52,511 --> 02:07:52,900
you know,

4745
02:07:52,900 --> 02:07:54,100
get to back position.

4746
02:07:54,510 --> 02:07:54,730
You know,

4747
02:07:54,730 --> 02:07:55,810
he gives up credit.

4748
02:07:56,010 --> 02:07:56,561
I left and right.

4749
02:07:56,561 --> 02:07:57,700
He's just a weird dude,

4750
02:07:58,000 --> 02:07:58,271
you know,

4751
02:07:58,271 --> 02:07:59,051
that's the problem.

4752
02:07:59,051 --> 02:07:59,351
You know,

4753
02:07:59,351 --> 02:07:59,621
he's,

4754
02:07:59,621 --> 02:08:00,460
he's a fucking,

4755
02:08:00,790 --> 02:08:01,601
he's basically,

4756
02:08:01,601 --> 02:08:01,781
you know,

4757
02:08:01,781 --> 02:08:02,620
he's an entertainer,

4758
02:08:02,650 --> 02:08:03,250
you know.

4759
02:08:03,250 --> 02:08:03,521
I mean,

4760
02:08:03,521 --> 02:08:03,751
he's a,

4761
02:08:03,751 --> 02:08:05,230
he music is his thing,

4762
02:08:05,920 --> 02:08:07,090
but it could have just as well been in.

4763
02:08:07,100 --> 02:08:07,451
He'd been,

4764
02:08:07,451 --> 02:08:08,410
it could have been an actor.

4765
02:08:08,500 --> 02:08:09,910
He easily could have been a comic.

4766
02:08:10,090 --> 02:08:10,361
You know,

4767
02:08:10,361 --> 02:08:10,750
we,

4768
02:08:10,750 --> 02:08:11,830
I tried to talk him into it,

4769
02:08:11,831 --> 02:08:12,940
he tried it for a while,

4770
02:08:13,060 --> 02:08:14,560
but he was doing too
many different things.

4771
02:08:14,560 --> 02:08:18,340
He was trying to teach Jujitsu and try
to do music and try and do comedy and it

4772
02:08:18,341 --> 02:08:19,174
was just too hard for him.

4773
02:08:19,230 --> 02:08:19,430
He,

4774
02:08:19,430 --> 02:08:19,740
he,

4775
02:08:19,740 --> 02:08:22,690
he came up with some good material
and he was trying for a little bit,

4776
02:08:22,691 --> 02:08:24,010
but he's an entertainer,

4777
02:08:24,040 --> 02:08:24,311
you know,

4778
02:08:24,311 --> 02:08:24,611
it was just,

4779
02:08:24,611 --> 02:08:28,210
Jujitsu became something for him
to focus his energy on and he got,

4780
02:08:28,211 --> 02:08:29,800
he's got a special knack for it.

4781
02:08:30,010 --> 02:08:32,470
And he's just a dude that
if he focuses on shit,

4782
02:08:32,590 --> 02:08:33,700
he can get real good at shit.

4783
02:08:34,060 --> 02:08:36,940
He just doesn't get taken seriously
because he's an entertainer.

4784
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:37,750
You know,

4785
02:08:37,750 --> 02:08:39,080
we thought of,

4786
02:08:39,120 --> 02:08:39,911
you get thought of.

4787
02:08:39,911 --> 02:08:42,160
We all get thought of when
you're an entertainer,

4788
02:08:42,760 --> 02:08:44,140
you get thought of as
being a silly person.

4789
02:08:44,380 --> 02:08:44,771
You're not a,

4790
02:08:44,771 --> 02:08:46,330
you're not a person to be taken seriously.

4791
02:08:46,331 --> 02:08:47,380
You're a frivolous person,

4792
02:08:47,770 --> 02:08:47,951
you know,

4793
02:08:47,951 --> 02:08:49,090
because you're doing this and you know,

4794
02:08:49,091 --> 02:08:49,451
you're like,

4795
02:08:49,451 --> 02:08:50,181
look at me.

4796
02:08:50,181 --> 02:08:51,210
And when the game rude,

4797
02:08:51,211 --> 02:08:52,044
it could me

4798
02:08:52,610 --> 02:08:54,560
saw Doug Stan hope over the weekend.

4799
02:08:54,740 --> 02:08:55,573
That was Doug.

4800
02:08:55,730 --> 02:08:56,511
Really good man.

4801
02:08:56,511 --> 02:08:56,661
He,

4802
02:08:56,661 --> 02:08:58,010
and he did a really good show.

4803
02:08:58,400 --> 02:08:59,690
Different from his Oslo.

4804
02:08:59,880 --> 02:09:00,713
Yeah.

4805
02:09:00,970 --> 02:09:01,803
Yeah.

4806
02:09:01,910 --> 02:09:02,091
Well,

4807
02:09:02,091 --> 02:09:02,561
I didn't see that.

4808
02:09:02,561 --> 02:09:03,440
I saw most of it,

4809
02:09:03,740 --> 02:09:05,450
but what I saw was on new to me,

4810
02:09:05,690 --> 02:09:07,460
but a really cool seeing him,

4811
02:09:07,461 --> 02:09:07,880
man.

4812
02:09:07,880 --> 02:09:08,181
He,

4813
02:09:08,181 --> 02:09:08,710
uh,

4814
02:09:08,710 --> 02:09:09,010
yeah,

4815
02:09:09,010 --> 02:09:09,300
he,

4816
02:09:09,300 --> 02:09:09,631
he,

4817
02:09:09,631 --> 02:09:11,720
he packed the comedy store by the way,

4818
02:09:11,721 --> 02:09:16,200
that main room two shows is packed
night standing people Friday,

4819
02:09:16,380 --> 02:09:17,680
no one at night,

4820
02:09:17,710 --> 02:09:18,543
Thursday and Friday.

4821
02:09:19,190 --> 02:09:21,280
I told her that mother Fucker,

4822
02:09:21,340 --> 02:09:22,101
he's a bad dude.

4823
02:09:22,101 --> 02:09:22,790
It was 800.

4824
02:09:22,790 --> 02:09:24,380
All of this is 900 seats.

4825
02:09:24,590 --> 02:09:25,850
That's a weekend in some way.

4826
02:09:25,910 --> 02:09:26,920
What you just did it the two,

4827
02:09:27,110 --> 02:09:29,750
not even for 50 in the main route.

4828
02:09:29,780 --> 02:09:30,613
400.

4829
02:09:31,100 --> 02:09:31,261
And then,

4830
02:09:31,261 --> 02:09:31,520
you know what,

4831
02:09:31,520 --> 02:09:34,760
what's so awesome is that after the
show I was sitting outside with my

4832
02:09:34,761 --> 02:09:36,620
girlfriend and we're just
hanging out watching sunset.

4833
02:09:36,800 --> 02:09:38,240
About five people came up.

4834
02:09:38,241 --> 02:09:39,074
I was like,

4835
02:09:39,380 --> 02:09:39,741
hey man,

4836
02:09:39,741 --> 02:09:40,071
what's up?

4837
02:09:40,071 --> 02:09:43,340
All his fans knew I listened
to your podcasts and stuff,

4838
02:09:43,520 --> 02:09:45,460
but it gave me so much
Brownie points and like,

4839
02:09:45,461 --> 02:09:45,771
I was like,

4840
02:09:45,771 --> 02:09:45,951
wow,

4841
02:09:45,951 --> 02:09:46,790
you're famous.

4842
02:09:46,850 --> 02:09:47,270
Wow.

4843
02:09:47,270 --> 02:09:48,740
Did you get some extra
pussy because of that?

4844
02:09:48,770 --> 02:09:49,580
Yes.

4845
02:09:49,580 --> 02:09:50,001
Look at him.

4846
02:09:50,001 --> 02:09:50,834
He's so happy.

4847
02:09:50,900 --> 02:09:51,680
That's all right.

4848
02:09:51,680 --> 02:09:53,300
So how was the Stan Hope set?

4849
02:09:53,630 --> 02:09:54,020
Good.

4850
02:09:54,020 --> 02:09:54,621
Really good man.

4851
02:09:54,621 --> 02:09:54,981
It was,

4852
02:09:54,981 --> 02:09:55,630
uh,

4853
02:09:55,630 --> 02:09:56,540
it was his best shit.

4854
02:09:56,610 --> 02:09:57,320
Um,

4855
02:09:57,320 --> 02:09:58,310
it was all new to me.

4856
02:09:58,311 --> 02:10:02,240
It was a lot of just regular
Stan hope style material.

4857
02:10:02,241 --> 02:10:03,074
It was pretty good.

4858
02:10:03,200 --> 02:10:03,740
He uh,

4859
02:10:03,740 --> 02:10:05,780
he had a really funny joke a bit about,

4860
02:10:05,810 --> 02:10:06,110
uh,

4861
02:10:06,110 --> 02:10:06,861
baby pictures.

4862
02:10:06,861 --> 02:10:10,040
I don't have you ever heard him about
my baby pictures were showing him baby

4863
02:10:10,041 --> 02:10:10,401
pictures.

4864
02:10:10,401 --> 02:10:11,870
So don't do as material who've you crazy.

4865
02:10:11,900 --> 02:10:12,291
No I'm not.

4866
02:10:12,291 --> 02:10:13,160
I'm not saying what it is.

4867
02:10:13,161 --> 02:10:13,880
Give up the premise.

4868
02:10:13,880 --> 02:10:14,770
It's about the big picture.

4869
02:10:15,610 --> 02:10:16,370
Did you um,

4870
02:10:16,370 --> 02:10:17,780
did you have to stand or did you sit down?

4871
02:10:18,110 --> 02:10:18,801
I stood just,

4872
02:10:18,801 --> 02:10:19,650
I mean I could've have stayed.

4873
02:10:19,680 --> 02:10:21,620
I didn't have a ticket so
I just stood in the back.

4874
02:10:21,740 --> 02:10:24,590
That's the I learned from
watching his last show.

4875
02:10:24,650 --> 02:10:25,100
No more.

4876
02:10:25,100 --> 02:10:26,630
No more standing on
you and I both learned.

4877
02:10:26,940 --> 02:10:30,840
So I changed our whole show and we talked
about it and Joey talked about to you

4878
02:10:30,841 --> 02:10:32,850
standing and watching a
show is a fucking bitch.

4879
02:10:32,880 --> 02:10:33,713
That fun.

4880
02:10:33,780 --> 02:10:34,070
It ain't

4881
02:10:34,070 --> 02:10:34,641
fun for people.

4882
02:10:34,641 --> 02:10:37,520
So sit down bitches cause
we got some shows coming up.

4883
02:10:37,540 --> 02:10:37,790
Yeah.

4884
02:10:37,790 --> 02:10:42,770
Joey and I are going to be in Pittsburgh
at the Carnegie Music Hall and that is

4885
02:10:43,220 --> 02:10:44,030
Saturday,

4886
02:10:44,030 --> 02:10:47,990
January 25th it is already or not January,

4887
02:10:47,990 --> 02:10:47,991
June,

4888
02:10:47,991 --> 02:10:48,560
excuse me.

4889
02:10:48,560 --> 02:10:49,071
Saturday,

4890
02:10:49,071 --> 02:10:52,430
June 25th and it's already
more than half sold out.

4891
02:10:52,790 --> 02:10:55,700
And then Joey can't go
to Canada unfortunately.

4892
02:10:56,030 --> 02:10:56,511
But uh,

4893
02:10:56,511 --> 02:10:57,530
the vogue theater,

4894
02:10:57,531 --> 02:11:01,580
I'm going to be there with young Tom
Segura and that motherfucker better not be

4895
02:11:01,581 --> 02:11:02,414
sick.

4896
02:11:02,480 --> 02:11:05,420
That's June 9th in Vancouver
and that I believe is sold out.

4897
02:11:05,421 --> 02:11:06,710
I think there's the only
thing that's available.

4898
02:11:06,711 --> 02:11:07,610
It's like a couple of seats.

4899
02:11:07,970 --> 02:11:12,970
And then on July 1st the full death
squad will be at Mandalay Bay theater.

4900
02:11:14,930 --> 02:11:16,190
It'll be Joey Diaz.

4901
02:11:16,340 --> 02:11:20,660
Ari should fear me and Doug Benson is
going to be in the neighborhood too.

4902
02:11:20,661 --> 02:11:22,640
So Doug Benson to probably
do a guest set as well.

4903
02:11:22,850 --> 02:11:25,240
And if we get Brian fucked up enough,

4904
02:11:25,250 --> 02:11:26,750
maybe we'll throw him to the dogs too.

4905
02:11:27,110 --> 02:11:29,300
It's a big crazy theater and uh,

4906
02:11:29,360 --> 02:11:29,571
yeah,

4907
02:11:29,571 --> 02:11:30,530
that's a UFC weekend.

4908
02:11:30,531 --> 02:11:34,880
It's Dominick Cruz versus Uriah Faber
bitches on Saturday jet July 2nd dop and

4909
02:11:34,881 --> 02:11:35,331
Faby.

4910
02:11:35,331 --> 02:11:36,590
God dammit calls.

4911
02:11:36,591 --> 02:11:37,400
I have to do it.

4912
02:11:37,400 --> 02:11:37,881
I don't,

4913
02:11:37,881 --> 02:11:38,760
don't come out him.

4914
02:11:38,940 --> 02:11:40,100
There's a bunch of good fighters,

4915
02:11:40,310 --> 02:11:41,450
a lot of good fights at July.

4916
02:11:41,451 --> 02:11:42,680
Second Card is the shit.

4917
02:11:42,980 --> 02:11:45,230
I'm sorry that we were away for so long,

4918
02:11:45,231 --> 02:11:46,011
but God damn,

4919
02:11:46,011 --> 02:11:47,690
it feels good to be back
talking to you guys.

4920
02:11:47,930 --> 02:11:48,950
I hope you enjoyed the show.

4921
02:11:49,080 --> 02:11:49,913
I knew a plug.

4922
02:11:50,330 --> 02:11:50,550
Yeah,

4923
02:11:50,550 --> 02:11:50,730
sure.

4924
02:11:50,730 --> 02:11:53,510
How about Winston's is San Diego Sunday.

4925
02:11:53,780 --> 02:11:55,730
Saturday jewel fought the seven o'clock.

4926
02:11:55,731 --> 02:11:56,630
I've been there before.

4927
02:11:56,900 --> 02:11:57,860
It's a great little place.

4928
02:11:57,861 --> 02:11:58,970
Come on out and say hello.

4929
02:11:58,971 --> 02:12:00,530
We'll have some fucking banana bread.

4930
02:12:00,590 --> 02:12:02,120
Winston's and San Diego.

4931
02:12:02,180 --> 02:12:03,650
June 4th Saturday.

4932
02:12:03,680 --> 02:12:04,130
Yup.

4933
02:12:04,130 --> 02:12:04,491
Sat.

4934
02:12:04,491 --> 02:12:05,324
That's next weekend.

4935
02:12:05,400 --> 02:12:05,960
Next weekend.

4936
02:12:05,960 --> 02:12:06,540
Next weekend.

4937
02:12:06,540 --> 02:12:07,373
Who you there with?

4938
02:12:07,430 --> 02:12:08,070

4939
02:12:08,070 --> 02:12:09,610
Bunch of fucking San Diego guys.

4940
02:12:09,620 --> 02:12:11,300
Just rocking a lot of guys
down there in San Diego.

4941
02:12:11,301 --> 02:12:11,401
La,

4942
02:12:11,401 --> 02:12:12,234
San Diego comicon.

4943
02:12:13,130 --> 02:12:14,600
There's a little community
going on down there.

4944
02:12:14,601 --> 02:12:14,931
Fuck you.

4945
02:12:14,931 --> 02:12:16,610
Ocean beach or it's always a great time.

4946
02:12:16,611 --> 02:12:17,444
Itselves up.

4947
02:12:17,460 --> 02:12:18,400
So get down there.

4948
02:12:18,760 --> 02:12:20,090
The only pack like two incidents.

4949
02:12:20,091 --> 02:12:21,790
The place you played that big dome?

4950
02:12:21,800 --> 02:12:22,390
No,

4951
02:12:22,390 --> 02:12:22,870
he played.

4952
02:12:22,870 --> 02:12:23,301
I did.

4953
02:12:23,301 --> 02:12:24,134
Um,

4954
02:12:24,350 --> 02:12:26,870
fifth and main and always prop.

4955
02:12:26,890 --> 02:12:28,000
Juvenate oh,

4956
02:12:28,010 --> 02:12:28,970
June 8th is though.

4957
02:12:28,971 --> 02:12:30,020
That's your Wednesday show.

4958
02:12:34,200 --> 02:12:34,550
No,

4959
02:12:34,550 --> 02:12:36,650
I'm not taking my fucking CD in Vancouver.

4960
02:12:36,651 --> 02:12:36,891
I cut.

4961
02:12:36,891 --> 02:12:38,540
I couldn't get it cleared in time.

4962
02:12:38,750 --> 02:12:41,210
I'm going to have to hold
it off for a few months.

4963
02:12:41,260 --> 02:12:41,570
Good.

4964
02:12:41,570 --> 02:12:42,700
Let's do Houston bit.

4965
02:12:44,040 --> 02:12:45,200
All the shots.

4966
02:12:47,520 --> 02:12:50,890
Ten nine we just take over
fucking Improv or theater.

4967
02:12:50,900 --> 02:12:51,733
You had a choice.

4968
02:12:51,830 --> 02:12:52,191
What is it?

4969
02:12:52,191 --> 02:12:56,660
October 10 10 October 8th
you'll definitely be ready.

4970
02:12:56,661 --> 02:12:57,494
Everybody's ready.

4971
02:12:57,560 --> 02:12:59,760
October 8th is the UFC heavy off?

4972
02:12:59,860 --> 02:13:04,130
So maybe we'd do it October like seventh
sixth and seventh 87 till the two shows

4973
02:13:04,131 --> 02:13:04,850
in Houston.

4974
02:13:04,850 --> 02:13:05,710
Houston to be perfect.

4975
02:13:06,260 --> 02:13:07,370
We ain't been there forever.

4976
02:13:08,010 --> 02:13:12,080
Or you could just do the bud light
extravaganza in New Orleans and make the

4977
02:13:12,081 --> 02:13:13,760
motherfucker drive from,

4978
02:13:14,150 --> 02:13:15,710
you've never done it New Orleans before.

4979
02:13:16,340 --> 02:13:17,920
Never done a fucking special.

4980
02:13:17,921 --> 02:13:18,754
That's a,

4981
02:13:18,950 --> 02:13:20,480
I think that's so September,

4982
02:13:20,481 --> 02:13:22,820
September 16th and
that's already too quick.

4983
02:13:22,821 --> 02:13:23,301
But I don't know.

4984
02:13:23,301 --> 02:13:24,950
Maybe that gave up that
information too early.

4985
02:13:24,951 --> 02:13:26,530
I don't know if that's public knowledge.

4986
02:13:26,540 --> 02:13:26,931
Public.

4987
02:13:26,931 --> 02:13:27,491
Is it public?

4988
02:13:27,491 --> 02:13:30,150
I've Jones and my man
got a commercial lot.

4989
02:13:30,170 --> 02:13:31,440
That's why when he went to the doctor,

4990
02:13:31,441 --> 02:13:31,741
they said,

4991
02:13:31,741 --> 02:13:32,221
Jon Jones,

4992
02:13:32,221 --> 02:13:32,701
you kidding me?

4993
02:13:32,701 --> 02:13:33,750
You'll fight motherfucker.

4994
02:13:34,100 --> 02:13:35,280
You go into the warm leads,

4995
02:13:35,281 --> 02:13:35,930
motherfucker.

4996
02:13:35,930 --> 02:13:38,040
Joe is going to fight but think about it.

4997
02:13:38,041 --> 02:13:41,220
But by the way through the commercial
with Dana as Dana was walking away,

4998
02:13:41,221 --> 02:13:42,720
twenties are falling out of his pocket.

4999
02:13:42,990 --> 02:13:44,250
So you know how that goes.

5000
02:13:44,251 --> 02:13:46,950
It's going to be a
rampage versus John Jones.

5001
02:13:47,200 --> 02:13:48,033
That'll be,

5002
02:13:48,060 --> 02:13:50,400
where would you put that with the shit?

5003
02:13:51,290 --> 02:13:53,640
I put that New Orleans New
Orleans ain't bad either.

5004
02:13:53,641 --> 02:13:57,480
Same mother fucking difference cause
there's only two from Memphis to from

5005
02:13:57,481 --> 02:13:58,260
Houston.

5006
02:13:58,260 --> 02:13:59,510
They could come from all over.

5007
02:13:59,530 --> 02:14:00,363
You know what I'm saying?

5008
02:14:00,650 --> 02:14:03,480
Pick up by the check yourself
before you wreck yourself.

5009
02:14:04,260 --> 02:14:07,680

Ari's going to talk about
his a mushroom initiative.

5024
02:14:45,481 --> 02:14:47,670
He's trying to have a day where
everyone in the country does mushrooms.

5025
02:14:47,671 --> 02:14:49,320
He's going to promote the
shit out of that red bed.

5026
02:14:49,350 --> 02:14:49,921
Did it already.

5027
02:14:49,921 --> 02:14:51,420
And then we got Wednesday.

5028
02:14:51,510 --> 02:14:51,781
Yeah.

5029
02:14:51,781 --> 02:14:53,040
When red bands already done,

5030
02:14:53,320 --> 02:14:54,110
he's done for like I said,

5031
02:14:54,110 --> 02:14:55,200
six month period at least.

5032
02:14:55,260 --> 02:15:00,150
And then Wednesday we got Duncan Trussell
so we've got a full three day death

5033
02:15:00,151 --> 02:15:02,730
squad week Dunkin Ren Joey,

5034
02:15:02,731 --> 02:15:03,371
just to make it up.

5035
02:15:03,371 --> 02:15:04,500
Thank you very much for having me.

5036
02:15:04,501 --> 02:15:05,420
Thank you for how you,

5037
02:15:06,300 --> 02:15:07,290
you always got some guy.

5038
02:15:07,320 --> 02:15:08,580
I've known you for 20 fucking years.

5039
02:15:08,581 --> 02:15:11,620
You always got new stories that haven't
been all I've got on the GRE experience

5040
02:15:11,680 --> 02:15:12,790
cause this is all we gotta.

5041
02:15:13,130 --> 02:15:15,090
We gotta make some Jie experienced shirts.

5042
02:15:15,520 --> 02:15:16,500
Oh well I got the,

5043
02:15:16,501 --> 02:15:17,334
I got you.

5044
02:15:17,480 --> 02:15:17,850
I'm going to wait.

5045
02:15:17,850 --> 02:15:18,750
I shouldn't wear your shirt today.

5046
02:15:18,751 --> 02:15:19,321
I work tomorrow.

5047
02:15:19,321 --> 02:15:20,300
I can't worry a gyro.

5048
02:15:20,301 --> 02:15:21,180
And that's kind of a critique.

5049
02:15:21,510 --> 02:15:22,410
Where'd your own shirt?

5050
02:15:22,620 --> 02:15:25,020
It's so we up and talked
about the hire desk,

5051
02:15:25,030 --> 02:15:28,140
primary.com they sold out
literally within an hour,

5052
02:15:28,141 --> 02:15:30,960
and we got new ones coming in and we've
got a bunch of new designs up their cock

5053
02:15:30,970 --> 02:15:31,530
suckers.

5054
02:15:31,530 --> 02:15:31,831
And,

5055
02:15:31,831 --> 02:15:31,951
uh,

5056
02:15:31,951 --> 02:15:32,580
we love you.

5057
02:15:32,580 --> 02:15:33,000
That's it.

5058
02:15:33,000 --> 02:15:33,740
Thank you very much.

5059
02:15:33,740 --> 02:15:35,220
Glad we ain't going nowhere.
