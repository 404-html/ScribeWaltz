1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:01,380
Oh,
we're live.

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:05,550
Will you guys betting on look,
look around real quick.

3
00:00:05,551 --> 00:00:08,020
Do you know what's new?
Hm?

4
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:09,750
Easy.
It's easier than you think.

5
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:13,260
Bruce Lee.
Bruce Lee.

6
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:14,370
Yeah,
but still.

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,680
But still though.
He didn't say it.

8
00:00:15,681 --> 00:00:16,720
He goes,
I wonder if he'll say rise.

9
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:17,310
He gets out.
I said,

10
00:00:17,311 --> 00:00:18,300
no,
I should have bet you money.

11
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:21,750
I was going to say it this way.
You've seen it right away.

12
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:22,920
No,
I saw it immediately.

13
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,510
Pretty Dope.
That is dope.

14
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,560
Just sent those in.
This guy's a bad motherfucker.

15
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:31,200
Plastic.
Sell this shit.

16
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:36,260
There's a great.
As a great hip hop album I listened to 

17
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:36,260
in high school and they use one of his 
quotes,

18
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:36,260
one of my favorites.
He says,

19
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:38,970
honestly,
expressing oneself is really hard to do.

20
00:00:38,971 --> 00:00:43,971
I can use.
I can use really fancy movements and 

21
00:00:43,971 --> 00:00:45,420
show you really crazy things,
but to honestly express myself,

22
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:47,610
that is really hard to do.

23
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:53,090
It's a.
it's like a beautiful little sound clip 

24
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:55,220
before they start the song,
but it's like just him talking to 

25
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:57,891
someone isn't an humbling when someone 
dies really young like he does and they 

26
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:59,340
did way more in their life than you ever
will.

27
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,410
Makes me sad.
I'm like,

28
00:01:01,411 --> 00:01:03,600
what am I going to do?
You stop and think about it.

29
00:01:03,601 --> 00:01:08,040
Like who the fuck else has had that kind
of an impact and you know,

30
00:01:08,041 --> 00:01:11,040
he died in what,
1970 something in the seventies.

31
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:12,930
Yeah.
And he was young.

32
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:18,170
Yeah,
I think he was like 30 or 31 or 32 or 

33
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:21,531
something like that.
Find out how old Bruce Lee was when he 

34
00:01:21,531 --> 00:01:21,570
died.
It's not like I was listening to Hendrix

35
00:01:21,571 --> 00:01:24,810
last night on the way the studio or a 
lot of the comedy store.

36
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:29,400
You have one of my 33 and he died when 
he was 27.

37
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:34,480
How much Hendrix music is there out 
there and he died when he was 27 here.

38
00:01:34,481 --> 00:01:39,481
But then you think,
do you think he'd be happy with what's 

39
00:01:39,481 --> 00:01:41,991
going on?
Like I always find that like what would 

40
00:01:41,991 --> 00:01:42,660
they be doing today?
That trips me up.

41
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,520
Yeah.
Well you can't do that.

42
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:45,150
No,
I know,

43
00:01:45,151 --> 00:01:46,030
but that'll be like,
oh,

44
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:49,470
they had such like a because right.
There's guys that lasted a long time and

45
00:01:49,471 --> 00:01:54,471
they either like or making garbage or 
they're slowly still making cool shit 

46
00:01:54,471 --> 00:01:55,410
here and there whenever they want to.
Yeah.

47
00:01:55,411 --> 00:01:57,570
There's the variety.
So.

48
00:01:57,571 --> 00:02:00,750
And then there's people that just,
nobody wants to hear their new shit.

49
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:02,550
Right.
It's like the rolling stones.

50
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:03,180
Yeah.
You're like,

51
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:04,410
Nah,
start me up.

52
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:09,680
Come on.
Nobody wants to hear like new rolling 

53
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:09,680
stones.
One's called car tire.

54
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,860
Don't play that.
Don't play that.

55
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:11,820
Isn't that weird though?

56
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:14,790
Because they're all time greats.
Yeah.

57
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,560
But if they started playing some song 
you haven't heard,

58
00:02:16,561 --> 00:02:19,680
you're like,
fuck is all this.

59
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:20,460
That's kind of like A.
Yes.

60
00:02:20,461 --> 00:02:21,900
Yesterday I was,
when I was running,

61
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,030
they had this thing called the big 
three.

62
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:29,330
It's a,
it's a post NBA League for players to 

63
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:32,961
play in once,
once I retire it was just three on 

64
00:02:32,961 --> 00:02:35,271
three,
but it's really sad to watch guys that 

65
00:02:35,271 --> 00:02:35,271
have been retired for like 10 years 
who've been because you're like,

66
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,250
this is just bad.
It's like,

67
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:39,690
it's like say you want to just remember 
them when they were amazing,

68
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:41,580
but now they're just old,
too old to be.

69
00:02:41,581 --> 00:02:43,620
It's like,
it's like circusy,

70
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:48,621
you know what I mean?
Like people are showing up just to like 

71
00:02:48,621 --> 00:02:48,621
see those names,
but they're there.

72
00:02:48,621 --> 00:02:48,840
It's really bad to watch how old they 
are.

73
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,090
I mean there is no minimum.

74
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:56,150
I just think it's,
you have to be retired from the league 

75
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:56,150
to play in it.
But like,

76
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:57,720
I mean the average age has got to be 40.
Maybe seat.

77
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:00,220
It depends on the.
And the athlete.

78
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:05,050
Like Hopkins was fighting in his forties
at his best.

79
00:03:05,051 --> 00:03:06,250
Different though.
Yeah.

80
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,850
Basketball is just,
it's such a young man's game.

81
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:11,980
I mean it was boxing.
I know,

82
00:03:11,981 --> 00:03:16,981
but there's something about it that's 
like a hard to watch and I'll do with 

83
00:03:16,981 --> 00:03:19,711
gray hair missing free throws.
That's a weird guy who used to be 

84
00:03:19,711 --> 00:03:20,740
phenomenal.
I understand what you're saying,

85
00:03:20,741 --> 00:03:25,741
but I disagree in the fact that it's 
even sadder watching an old guy get the 

86
00:03:25,741 --> 00:03:27,040
fuck beat out.
Used to be good.

87
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:27,790
Yeah.
That's sad.

88
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,910
That's sad.
But fighting.

89
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:34,950
But.
But he's still probably fights because 

90
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:34,950
he loves it.
No,

91
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:34,950
no,
just for the money.

92
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:35,740
It's for money.
Yeah.

93
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:37,720
I mean they fight because they love the 
competition,

94
00:03:37,721 --> 00:03:39,940
but they get paid.
They're doing it from us.

95
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:42,400
But these guys are doing the big three.
There's no way they enjoy it anymore.

96
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,510
Oh,
how do you know?

97
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:45,430
There's no way.
It just looked so sad.

98
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,010
So sad.
Do you think that.

99
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:53,100
I think with basketball too,
it's wear and tear on the knees so that 

100
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:53,100
your back,
your knees,

101
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:54,520
everything left.
Right?

102
00:03:54,521 --> 00:03:55,720
Left.
Right when you walked.

103
00:03:55,721 --> 00:03:58,630
There's a guy named Glen Davis,
Big Baby Davis and he was.

104
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:01,600
He always had like big problems in 
league being so heavy on his,

105
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:03,640
on his knees and his back and it's even 
worse there.

106
00:04:03,641 --> 00:04:06,190
He fell once during it and rolled around
for like five minutes.

107
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,510
I was like,
this is so sad to watch like this.

108
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,330
And their cameras are just focusing on 
him.

109
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,030
And rapaport is doing the announcing.
Michael Rob Portman.

110
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:13,910
Man,
he's doing.

111
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:16,390
He's doing the interview.
It's so weird,

112
00:04:16,391 --> 00:04:17,590
man.
It's so weird.

113
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:22,600
He's like a 80 year old,
20 year old yet.

114
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:29,040
He's just,
his career is on this crazy revival 

115
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,790
train and it's almost like he is going 
back to young rappaport style.

116
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:32,820
He's a funny dude,
man.

117
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:33,700
Oh,
he's hilarious.

118
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:34,940
Interviewing.
Um,

119
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:37,930
I guess it was,
I forget what it was,

120
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:41,740
but he was interviewing these guys and 
he's like Kinda hunched over,

121
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:47,050
like talking to him and he's a big guy 
and he's got this look on his face.

122
00:04:47,051 --> 00:04:49,600
He's interviewed them.
Like this is such a weird combination of

123
00:04:49,601 --> 00:04:51,240
like an old guy at a young guy.
Yeah,

124
00:04:51,241 --> 00:04:51,530
yeah,
yeah.

125
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:52,180
He,
but he,

126
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:54,130
but he's connected with the youth so 
heavily.

127
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:55,450
Oh yeah.
Well he did that,

128
00:04:55,451 --> 00:05:00,451
but things.
He did that documentary for a tribe 

129
00:05:00,451 --> 00:05:00,451
called quest,
like he still wants.

130
00:05:00,451 --> 00:05:04,580
He still is in like that,
that youthful world of like music and 

131
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:04,580
sports.

132
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:06,670
And do you ever see the rent that he 
went on after Charlottesville?

133
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:12,170
But those Tiki torch carrier and white 
guy did Tiki torch motherfuckers,

134
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,470
but he's loose,
you know,

135
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,610
I mean he's out there.
He's,

136
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,650
he's very funny on the fighter and the 
kid too.

137
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:21,550
He goes on,
he's hysterical and he,

138
00:05:21,551 --> 00:05:26,551
you know,
he goes and he fights with the whole 

139
00:05:26,551 --> 00:05:28,381
Howard stern staff.
He loves fight with those guys because 

140
00:05:28,381 --> 00:05:28,381
they all do like fantasy football and 
all that stuff.

141
00:05:28,381 --> 00:05:30,070
He's,
he's vocally a massive sports fan,

142
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:35,430
which I think him that keeps him in that
youth circle so much that he just loves 

143
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:36,970
sports and loves talking sports to 
everybody.

144
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,880
Yeah.
He hosts sports shows sometimes,

145
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:43,730
like he's hosted different peoples.
One of those radio TV shows,

146
00:05:43,731 --> 00:05:45,220
those radio shows.
They constantly,

147
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:48,650
they show on TV occasionally.
One of those who does those.

148
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:49,750
They're like a Dan.

149
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:52,230
Patrick and Patrick has one.
Yeah,

150
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:53,550
yeah,
yeah.

151
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:58,590
Those are the guys that left espn.
I don't know Jack Shit about sports man.

152
00:05:59,330 --> 00:05:59,900
Yeah,
you do.

153
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,670
I don't know about sports that you know 
about,

154
00:06:01,671 --> 00:06:06,671
but that's all I know about.
Like the problem is people try to talk 

155
00:06:06,671 --> 00:06:06,671
to me about other sports because I 
fucking believe that game.

156
00:06:06,671 --> 00:06:10,550
Like that's everybody.
Like some like Ian Edwards loved soccer.

157
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:16,420
I can't tell you.
I couldn't tell you a position other 

158
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:16,420
than goalie.
Yeah.

159
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:17,420
You named one forward.
See,

160
00:06:17,421 --> 00:06:19,280
but I think that then I think about 
hockey because I'm like,

161
00:06:19,281 --> 00:06:21,810
I know hockey,
but I had no idea about isn't talking to

162
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:26,390
the same soccer just with like know very
close.

163
00:06:26,391 --> 00:06:31,391
They're pretty close as a midfielder.
Did Senator Defense forward and defense?

164
00:06:33,321 --> 00:06:34,430
Yeah.
Are They all defense?

165
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:36,500
SORTA when you're on defense?
Yeah.

166
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:37,850
Same as hockey.
I can't.

167
00:06:37,851 --> 00:06:38,660
I'm sorry I couldn't.

168
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:43,660
I was in Italy when the World Cup was 
going on and it was amazing to watch 

169
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:44,900
Europeans watched that shit because they
love it rather go crazy.

170
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:46,130
Check the APP.
Totally checked out.

171
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:48,290
I was talking about this before would 
ruin it for me.

172
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:53,291
It was.
I was in boulder when the World Cup was 

173
00:06:53,291 --> 00:06:55,001
happening and these dorky white guys 
pretending to be way too enthusiastic 

174
00:06:55,001 --> 00:06:56,900
about the World Cup dude.
Because the World Cup.

175
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:57,740
Yeah.
You know,

176
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:01,650
it's that thing not into it.
He knew that fake thing that people do.

177
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:06,350
They're like fucking yes,
but it's not real.

178
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:11,400
The Olympics does that to.
The Olympics has this thing when people 

179
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,201
get into like,
it's cool to cheer for your country or 

180
00:07:14,201 --> 00:07:16,811
whatever,
but it's so funny when people get into 

181
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:16,811
the Olympics and they're like,
do you watch us and lose?

182
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:17,530
Did you watch us rip it up and loose?
No,

183
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:18,680
I don't fucking why?

184
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:21,960
What are you talking about?
That's not where we rip it up.

185
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:27,610
Was I asleep?
We were fucking shit up and loose 

186
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:27,610
yesterday.
I didn't know.

187
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:30,020
I had no idea.
Like the Winter Olympics,

188
00:07:30,021 --> 00:07:35,021
everyone freaks out and they have sports
that you would never even think about 

189
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:37,691
wanting to watch.
Like the cross country ski and then you 

190
00:07:37,691 --> 00:07:37,691
shoot on the ground in the ski some 
more.

191
00:07:37,691 --> 00:07:42,520
You would never.
I would never do again through 

192
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:42,520
basketball is going to be in the summer 
Olympics.

193
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,600
Is it really?
This big three thing is a big three.

194
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:45,410
That's it.
That's the.

195
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:50,440
That's the big three is the three on 
three tournament we were talking about 

196
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,050
with the ex NBA players,
but wait a minute,

197
00:07:51,051 --> 00:07:53,220
they put them in an Olympics.
Yeah,

198
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:55,820
dude,
I looked this up and I was so surprised.

199
00:07:55,821 --> 00:07:56,930
I was like,
what the fuck?

200
00:07:56,931 --> 00:08:01,931
I don't even,
I don't know what kind of competition 

201
00:08:01,931 --> 00:08:03,791
it's going to be,
but the big three success has led to it 

202
00:08:03,791 --> 00:08:04,460
being included in the next summer 
Olympic.

203
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:06,380
How many people are in a normal 
basketball game?

204
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:07,430
Ten,
five and five.

205
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:12,460
Five on five.
This three on three and it's half court 

206
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:12,860
and they have a four point shot,
which doesn't exist it.

207
00:08:12,861 --> 00:08:13,700
Yeah.
So you could shoot it.

208
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:18,701
I have a weird rule to it at once.
It gets down to four minutes that like 

209
00:08:18,701 --> 00:08:18,701
there are no,
I'm sorry.

210
00:08:18,701 --> 00:08:20,890
This was the basketball tournament has a
weird Rolando.

211
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:26,060
I just confuse the two things.
There's another tournament going on 

212
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:28,250
which is like amateur players and teams 
and it's a $1,000,000

213
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,420
tournament taste.
Actually 2 million,

214
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:32,510
2 million bucks.
So it's a tournament going on all across

215
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:35,090
the country.
We could have edited if we wanted to.

216
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,140
We should.
Would have lost,

217
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:41,141
but we wouldn't it be fun.
Just don't talk negative to me bro Bro.

218
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:45,900
You don't know my heart.
You know we would have been trading goes

219
00:08:45,901 --> 00:08:48,590
on of my head Bro.
This former NBA guys,

220
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,370
former college players,
whatever broke.

221
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:55,380
Don't put limitations on us.
We would have had an average height of 

222
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:55,380
five,
10.

223
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:57,550
We'd be killing,
but they have six,

224
00:08:57,730 --> 00:09:00,360
nine black dudes.
And these three white heads just.

225
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:01,740
Hey,
we're here to play.

226
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,720
Hi fellas.
Hey guys.

227
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:07,590
Just tying my shoes.
So,

228
00:09:07,591 --> 00:09:08,850
um,
what are the rules?

229
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,260
There's a four point.
Oh,

230
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:19,410
Joe just hugs the ball.
Just started fucking head money people 

231
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:19,410
out of the way.
Why can't we do that?

232
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:20,480
Why can,
why can't we play like that guys,

233
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,540
you got to go.
Well,

234
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:23,790
we tried.
I don't have any sports skills.

235
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:29,270
I don't know if you fell out,
so maybe you could just use you as the 

236
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:31,110
bowl and fall out.
You just feel what happens when you fall

237
00:09:31,111 --> 00:09:32,130
out.
You kick you out,

238
00:09:32,131 --> 00:09:37,131
you're done.
You can't play anymore else other than 

239
00:09:37,131 --> 00:09:37,131
this.
Then the game's over now.

240
00:09:37,131 --> 00:09:37,131
But they have two other players on their
bench that they rotate.

241
00:09:37,131 --> 00:09:42,050
Oh Jesus.
But we would have you fall as hard as 

242
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:42,050
you can to really fuck up their best 
players.

243
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:43,500
Oh,
you know what I mean?

244
00:09:43,501 --> 00:09:48,501
That strategy.
And then Jamie and I would have to bang 

245
00:09:48,501 --> 00:09:48,501
it out way to Dickie.
Do they have that?

246
00:09:48,501 --> 00:09:50,520
They have that in hockey.
The NBA,

247
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:55,580
same thing.
The Mba and guys get pissed because it 

248
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:55,580
ruins their career.
It costs millions of dollars.

249
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:57,600
I mean heck heck.
A shack was the original,

250
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:01,140
like they used to foul shack so because 
they knew what would they can do to stop

251
00:10:01,141 --> 00:10:02,880
him.
He's a fucking truck,

252
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:06,240
so he would just get the ball.
They would tomahawk them as hard as they

253
00:10:06,241 --> 00:10:07,470
could.
Oh my God.

254
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,160
Yeah man.
It was.

255
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:10,860
And he used to complain about it.
It was funny because because you know,

256
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:13,020
couch sports fans are always like,
oh,

257
00:10:13,021 --> 00:10:14,460
shut the fuck up.
You're huge.

258
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:16,770
You have no idea how he.
He is big.

259
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:21,890
But another huge dude that's just 
throwing their arms as hard as they can 

260
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:23,160
all gain duty.
He gets totally fucked up from that.

261
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:25,370
Wow.
Your handcuffs check was like the.

262
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:30,440
He was like the beginning.
It happened before that old NBA people 

263
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:30,440
will be like,
that's bullshit.

264
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,230
They didn't the 70,
but Shaq was just the biggest guy that's

265
00:10:31,231 --> 00:10:34,260
ever played with so much agility.
Whenever I shake his hand,

266
00:10:34,261 --> 00:10:35,340
I'm like,
what is that?

267
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:37,740
It's absurd.
It's like a desk.

268
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:38,690
It's like shit.

269
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:41,790
He's like,
hey man,

270
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:46,520
what's up Joe?
He did fear factor with me and him.

271
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:48,810
Him and I were like,
he was a huge fear factor fan.

272
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:54,040
So he did like a whole episode where he 
co hosted it with me and he stood next 

273
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:54,660
to me and he like,
he would do this.

274
00:10:54,661 --> 00:10:59,480
I'm going to do to Carol Boone.
Shocker ta,

275
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:02,270
Ta.
And when he would do the countdown,

276
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:07,280
almost standing next to him like this is
like an eight year old hanging out with 

277
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:07,280
his.
His Dad.

278
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,160
Oh all I hear stories like that that 
he's like,

279
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:09,750
he's a big kid on set.
They can like,

280
00:11:09,751 --> 00:11:14,751
you can't stop fucking around.
I felt an eight year old nephew who 

281
00:11:14,751 --> 00:11:14,751
grown up pig.
Yeah.

282
00:11:14,751 --> 00:11:16,470
He's so,
he's a big kid.

283
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,850
That's all I ever hear.
Anybody that works with him.

284
00:11:17,851 --> 00:11:19,320
Like he fucked.
He loves fucking around.

285
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,180
He loves not taking it serious.

286
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,800
Super Fun guy.
Very friendly.

287
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:23,730
No,
he's so dynamic.

288
00:11:23,731 --> 00:11:25,520
He's like a cop.
Yeah.

289
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:30,780
He,
he wants to do undercover work for in 

290
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:30,780
Miami or something.
Right.

291
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:32,900
Workflow for Lord or some shit like 
that.

292
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:33,420
He,
he,

293
00:11:33,421 --> 00:11:38,421
uh,
he would be involved in raids and Shit 

294
00:11:38,421 --> 00:11:38,421
and pretty hard to be undercover when 
you're 6:11

295
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:40,620
black dude.
He's,

296
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:42,960
he's got to be one of the biggest guys 
it's ever played,

297
00:11:42,961 --> 00:11:44,130
right.
Not the tallest,

298
00:11:44,131 --> 00:11:46,800
but probably one of the most.
Probably the most mass.

299
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,120
Yeah.
And Muscle.

300
00:11:48,121 --> 00:11:48,600
I mean,
you know,

301
00:11:48,601 --> 00:11:50,400
when you get up next to his arm,
it's,

302
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:51,960
it's,
it's this,

303
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:55,030
it's like two of my thighs.
He got into MMA for awhile.

304
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:57,370
Did the,
I don't know if he's doing it.

305
00:11:57,371 --> 00:11:58,030
Yeah,
training,

306
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:00,040
but there was videos of him training and
I'm just like,

307
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:02,830
look,
if there was no weight limitations,

308
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:04,030
a key.
So got,

309
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:04,920
look at him.

310
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:12,670
So fucking big.
That does look like a man in his buddy.

311
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:16,120
Yeah.
Child child and a grown man.

312
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:17,260
Yeah.
I have a picture.

313
00:12:17,261 --> 00:12:21,820
I have a picture of me at the MTV.
Was it at movie awards or something like

314
00:12:21,821 --> 00:12:26,821
that with him next to me and where I was
interviewing him for this thing and he 

315
00:12:26,821 --> 00:12:26,980
will always be the roast one of the 
road,

316
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,590
a Bieber and I'm in and I'm doing this 
with a microphone,

317
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:32,200
like full extension with it and he's 
bending down still.

318
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,810
You still have to doug?
I'm like it checked.

319
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:38,470
It's kind of weird that like the UFC has
a weight limit.

320
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:41,630
What's the top out to 65?
Yeah.

321
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:42,640
Isn't that weird?
Yeah.

322
00:12:42,641 --> 00:12:44,230
Why is that?
I don't know.

323
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:47,710
Does it get these super heavy,
super heavy?

324
00:12:47,711 --> 00:12:52,711
We've never had a super heavy fight,
but super heavyweight is to 65 and 

325
00:12:52,711 --> 00:12:52,711
above.
Well,

326
00:12:52,711 --> 00:12:57,151
who's the heaviest fighter that's ever 
fought to 65 when they weigh in after 

327
00:12:57,151 --> 00:12:59,980
that,
probably brock brock was cut and wait to

328
00:12:59,981 --> 00:13:02,640
make to 65.
Wasn't he around 300 pounds?

329
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:04,750
That.
That's fucking insane.

330
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:09,810
And it's a different kind of 300 pounds 
to 37 foot one.

331
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:15,010
His shoes are 22,
22.

332
00:13:15,011 --> 00:13:16,600
They're almost to.
His foot is two feet.

333
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:18,600
That's his foot.
That's all fucking bit.

334
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:19,690
Yeah.
His foot to two feet,

335
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:25,140
Jesus,
but like a guy like that could never 

336
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:25,720
fight in the UFC because you probably 
can't make two 65.

337
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:26,980
No.
If he did,

338
00:13:26,981 --> 00:13:31,300
he'd be fucking zero.
Zero fat.

339
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:36,500
I want.
But I wonder about how because he's so 

340
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:36,500
big.
He didn't have to lose 75 pounds.

341
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:36,500
Right?
Is it?

342
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,720
They say 3:30.
Is that what he weighed?

343
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:38,560
Yeah,
3:30.

344
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:42,310
It looked like as a rookie.
Oh my God.

345
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:45,310
He was so big.
So big.

346
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:47,620
And he's a kid right there,
by the way.

347
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:49,570
He's.
He's 20 or 19 or 20 years old,

348
00:13:49,571 --> 00:13:50,170
right?
That God.

349
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:51,040
Damn.
That's crazy.

350
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:54,310
It's a fucking full grown man at 20.
I mean,

351
00:13:54,311 --> 00:13:54,970
what?
Did you ever see this?

352
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,200
Do you ever see the movie blue chips?

353
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,010
Do you ever see that?
No.

354
00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:59,070
That's a great movie.
What she like about,

355
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:03,130
about Shaq mcnulty,
he's recruiting him.

356
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,590
Shaq.
Yeah.

357
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:07,490
It's fun.
It's a phenomenal book.

358
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:08,710
You would have.
You would love old tea.

359
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:10,390
What?
How good is that guy?

360
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,170
Oh,
that's awesome.

361
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:13,120
Oh,
he's so good in this fucking movie.

362
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,680
You know what?
He's amazing in.

363
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:18,040
It wasn't even a good movie,
but that movie warrior ever that.

364
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:22,960
Oh yeah,
he's fucking cook.

365
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:27,130
So the movie wasn't that good.
It was flawed.

366
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:28,000
Yeah.
But he's good.

367
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:30,910
You Know Brian Coulombs in that movie,
he played me,

368
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:36,180
literally did my role in the UFC and 
that movie.

369
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:36,640
Oh yeah.
He,

370
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:37,770
the,
he's the announcer.

371
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:39,550
He was telling me this.
I'm just going to.

372
00:14:39,551 --> 00:14:42,880
Do you want to pretend I'm you?
Except for like the skill and the talent

373
00:14:42,881 --> 00:14:44,240
and all that stuff.
Burn.

374
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:45,610
Listen,
I'm coming after you.

375
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:49,000
You son of a bitch.
Fight me Brian.

376
00:14:49,001 --> 00:14:51,010
There he is right there.
But Nick Nolte,

377
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:52,160
ds in that fucking movie.

378
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:57,160
Nick naulty plays the dad of one of the 
guys that's fighting and dairy is like 

379
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,180
total fucking.
I ran into him once,

380
00:14:59,181 --> 00:15:04,181
man at FRY's.
I was so happy that he knew my name 

381
00:15:04,181 --> 00:15:04,730
because he used to date Vicky Lewis,
who's a friend of mine.

382
00:15:04,731 --> 00:15:07,170
She was on news radio.
Very talented girl.

383
00:15:07,171 --> 00:15:09,830
She's that girl.
Extremely talented.

384
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:10,660
She's young,
Huh?

385
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:11,960
Vicky?
Not Anymore.

386
00:15:11,961 --> 00:15:14,690
Compared to him though,
because that was a big age gap.

387
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:16,740
It was a big age gap.
But um,

388
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:18,800
so I knew him from the set,
you know,

389
00:15:18,801 --> 00:15:23,801
he'd come to the set and hanging out and
I'm going to fry's and he's got his 

390
00:15:23,801 --> 00:15:25,070
reading glasses on and I said,
hey nick,

391
00:15:25,071 --> 00:15:26,400
what's up?
He'll told Joe,

392
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:31,940
I'm only,
I'm trying to get a computer from my 

393
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:32,840
kid.
Things that's really good.

394
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,880
Hey Joe.
It was weird.

395
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,830
It's like I'm talking to nick naulty.
Should I get a Mac?

396
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,610
So I was only like 27.
They'll still confused.

397
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:45,850
I'm still like,
I can't believe I'm really talking to 

398
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:45,850
Nick Nolte ended up right now.
No real.

399
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:47,120
This is real.
We're at FRY's.

400
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:51,950
Hey Man.
Nicknames Electronics too.

401
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:57,930
That was during my um,
my quake days when I was addicted to 

402
00:15:57,930 --> 00:15:58,480
quake and I'd make my own computers.
You,

403
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:02,480
you did all that shit.
I'll do 15 screens and all that shit.

404
00:16:02,481 --> 00:16:05,780
Like everyone does that.
I had a room in my house where it had a,

405
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:10,460
like a conference table and it was lined
up with computer monitors and computers.

406
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:12,530
I used to build computers.
But you play,

407
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:15,110
you don't play any games anymore while 
we're going to.

408
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:18,060
We just got,
when we set up his origin pcs,

409
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,810
we got to land room,
set up local area.

410
00:16:20,811 --> 00:16:22,370
Network Room.
Oh Shit.

411
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:25,160
Oh Shit.
All over the world.

412
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:26,840
Fire down.
Well,

413
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:29,270
you know what man,
now that we have the studio,

414
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:32,690
there's so much room here and my kids 
come here and play too.

415
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:35,240
You know,
there's plenty of stuff to do.

416
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:36,500
Yeah,
this is a lot.

417
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,340
Lots of.
So I'm just going to fuck it.

418
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,330
Put some games on for them,
put some games on for me.

419
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:41,990
Yeah,
that works.

420
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:44,150
I never got.
I never got into it for some reason.

421
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:49,270
Video Games,
like I loved him when I was a kid and 

422
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:49,380
then there was this weird cutoff then I 
was growing up now.

423
00:16:49,381 --> 00:16:51,650
But so many people still play.
Yeah,

424
00:16:51,651 --> 00:16:53,750
the non grownups,
those,

425
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:56,960
those non growing up guy.
But I wish I could play like I shamed me

426
00:16:56,961 --> 00:16:59,090
looking at him over there.
He's a sweet kid.

427
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:04,550
Ultimate watershed.
It's like ultimate warrior shirt is 

428
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:08,470
fully grown.
Mad Chicks love ultimate warrior.

429
00:17:08,841 --> 00:17:11,010
Did they love guys to play video games 
too,

430
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:11,270
right?
Yeah.

431
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:13,660
To sit inside all day.
Fuck yes dude.

432
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:18,680
Like just putting out just I want to get
pale more pale.

433
00:17:20,001 --> 00:17:22,790
I want to Paler and Paler.
Jamie the Paler.

434
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:24,200
You know what scares the shit out of me 
though.

435
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:29,590
Those multi role player,
what does it multi those giant role 

436
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:29,960
player go to work and I call them 
border.

437
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:35,080
What's the name?
Massively massive multiplayer online 

438
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:35,650
role playing.
Is that what fortnight is?

439
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,390
No,
I sound like a fucking dad.

440
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:40,250
They'll laugh at me shooter.
It's a third person.

441
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,540
Third Person.
That's their parents,

442
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:44,270
but isn't there but aren't you with a 
massive community of people?

443
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:44,800
Yeah.
People.

444
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:45,160
Yeah.
Yeah.

445
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:47,030
That's fucking 100 people in the game 
with you.

446
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,920
That's a lot to.
Yeah,

447
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,220
well that's a death match.

448
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:55,220
A quake death match.
A lot of times you're not really a 

449
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:55,220
hundred,
but it can be 100.

450
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:55,830
100.
Seems like it's absurd.

451
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:58,470
How many people are on your squat,
on your team up to four.

452
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:01,230
Oh,
50 on 50 match.

453
00:18:01,231 --> 00:18:03,930
Which is like a special.
Is it random assignments to teams or you

454
00:18:03,931 --> 00:18:07,970
go in picking your team or you can.
You actually can go in random to it.

455
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,780
You can do everything you want.
God,

456
00:18:09,781 --> 00:18:11,190
I can't wait to hear the comments on 
this video,

457
00:18:11,191 --> 00:18:13,230
but I do not know about fort night.
Dude,

458
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:18,340
I'm so mad that I have idea.
I see so many references online to it 

459
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:23,040
and I know what it is,
but I have no idea what it is.

460
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:26,770
I remember when people would call you a 
noob and they used to for ohs.

461
00:18:26,771 --> 00:18:28,640
Yeah,
new fucking knew.

462
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:32,950
It still goes on.
Does it still goes on?

463
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:33,660
Shit.
Like today,

464
00:18:33,661 --> 00:18:35,700
they're like brave.
Even right now there's $2,000,000

465
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:37,410
tournaments going on.
There's one there.

466
00:18:37,411 --> 00:18:42,411
I think they're both for charity today,
but one for fortnight and then another 

467
00:18:42,411 --> 00:18:42,411
one another.
Again,

468
00:18:42,411 --> 00:18:44,130
that's just like a called [inaudible],
which we've talked about before,

469
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:46,680
a million bucks.
How long do they have to play?

470
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:48,390
It might be like a two or three hour 
tournament.

471
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:51,990
That's fucking unreal.
So much money in video games now.

472
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:55,190
Parents used to tell their kids and not 
play video games like you don't.

473
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:57,510
Don't be a loser and they still have 
that shit in their head,

474
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:59,310
but it's.
There's more money in it.

475
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:02,640
Then like most games,
then you make people make careers out of

476
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:04,230
it.
What if there were a tennis player?

477
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:06,090
Oh,
bobby's a pro tennis player,

478
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:09,660
but will might blow his fucking ankles 
out timmy.

479
00:19:09,661 --> 00:19:13,710
Over there I was making a billion 
dollars playing fortnite hands.

480
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:15,000
Yeah.
This all day.

481
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:18,540
I do it all at Iowa guys.
I got a friend of my old roommate,

482
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:23,541
my first roommate in La.
He was like a PR professional online 

483
00:19:23,541 --> 00:19:23,541
Gamer,
and I thought I was like,

484
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:26,580
what?
That dude fatality reached out to us,

485
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,580
Jonathan Wendell tonality.
I'm going to try to get them on.

486
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:34,700
I figured out he's still playing.
He was the greatest quick player or one 

487
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:35,340
of the.
It's hard to say.

488
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:38,760
It's hard to say the greatest.
There was a few of those guys.

489
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,440
He was one of them.
How old is he now?

490
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:43,350
Probably in his late thirties.
Something like that.

491
00:19:43,351 --> 00:19:44,220
Yeah,
that sounds great.

492
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:45,540
What is he doing?
I always know what the.

493
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:47,370
I want to know what they do when they 
quit all that shit.

494
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:50,110
Just just breathe.
Just chilling,

495
00:19:50,111 --> 00:19:52,740
trying to figure out how to deal with 
all the radiation they'd been absorbing.

496
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:55,810
He's working at FRY's,
sat in front of that screen is.

497
00:19:58,050 --> 00:20:01,020
Hi Joe.
All your cells are mutated.

498
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:06,110
Some of them now I think.
I think some of them are smart enough 

499
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:08,421
now that they realized the uh,
how quick arises and how quick the fall 

500
00:20:08,421 --> 00:20:12,861
might be that they're just sort of 
banking money and just riding it out to 

501
00:20:12,861 --> 00:20:12,861
see how long it goes.
Yeah.

502
00:20:12,861 --> 00:20:16,821
But it's Kinda like Kinda like how 
engulf you only get paid paid if you 

503
00:20:16,821 --> 00:20:19,280
win.
Now not a lot of these guys can bank all

504
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:20,070
that money.
Right?

505
00:20:20,071 --> 00:20:21,780
They still got to have something to do 
after it's done.

506
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:27,660
That's the best bank.
But time majority of guys are just 

507
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:27,960
making a lady I just said,
and this the way.

508
00:20:27,961 --> 00:20:29,640
It's different though.
They don't have to pay a coach.

509
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:31,100
They don't.
They're just at home in their part.

510
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:36,200
In some cases their parent's house still
most cases where it might just by their 

511
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:36,270
parent's new house.
That might be their goal.

512
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:41,300
They buy their parents house and kick 
them the fuck out that's happening by 

513
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:41,300
their parent's house.
The.

514
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,780
Yeah.
You remember when you were playing video

515
00:20:42,781 --> 00:20:43,650
games,
Mike?

516
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:45,600
Getting the fuck out and take care of in
with you.

517
00:20:45,601 --> 00:20:46,580
Pack our shit up too.

518
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:51,100
Ryan's kicking us out.
Yeah.

519
00:20:51,101 --> 00:20:54,520
Get the fuck out.
You should have been so mean to him.

520
00:20:55,290 --> 00:20:57,580
Yeah.
Know the mom's bitching at him.

521
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:00,810
I didn't fucking know he could have 
bought us this nice.

522
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:05,470
Tom Toughening them up.
His wife became such a good player twice

523
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:09,440
when they're fucking assholes.
They take credit for it.

524
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:11,760
Did that toughened you up and that's why
you liked this?

525
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:16,300
Like a UC I tonya.
No I didn't and I can't do that.

526
00:21:16,301 --> 00:21:17,590
But that's what that is.
Is it?

527
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:20,830
Her mom was,
you saw that shit of her mom was fucking

528
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:25,860
atrocious.
And then when every time she got 

529
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:28,321
something she's like,
you know why that is because I made you 

530
00:21:28,321 --> 00:21:28,321
that way.
So she,

531
00:21:28,321 --> 00:21:30,400
she mind fucked her her whole life into 
being like even at her,

532
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:33,280
even when she,
even after the,

533
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:35,500
after the incident,
you know,

534
00:21:35,501 --> 00:21:38,050
even after the Kerrigan thing,
she was like,

535
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:41,050
I was always the one that made you the 
killer.

536
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:43,910
That's why we do this.
Oh she fucked her.

537
00:21:43,911 --> 00:21:45,850
So I mean she fucked with her head.
So deep.

538
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:48,070
Someone she was boxing.
Oh yeah man.

539
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:53,250
Tonya harding was boxed.
They talk about it unboxed and hope she 

540
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:53,980
bucks here.
And I was his coach.

541
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:56,640
She was actually all right.
She looked all right.

542
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:58,380
Well she's an athlete man.
Yeah,

543
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:01,790
like a legit.
And when she bulked up to I remember and

544
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:06,810
she was doing it because she was trying 
to cash check because she lost all her 

545
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:06,810
money,
man.

546
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:07,180
She lost all her machine.
Made much.

547
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:12,550
And what do you think she does now?
They talk about at the end of the film 

548
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:12,730
and I don't remember.
They tell you where,

549
00:22:12,731 --> 00:22:14,030
you know,
when they're like in the Chi,

550
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:16,240
run with it,
like she lives in so and so with her new

551
00:22:16,241 --> 00:22:21,241
husband and none of them.
She'll never talk to Jeff Gillooly 

552
00:22:21,241 --> 00:22:21,241
again.

553
00:22:21,241 --> 00:22:21,370
And who's Jeff Gillooly?
The Guy,

554
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:26,490
her boyfriend,
the one that was like the head Nancy 

555
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:26,740
Kerrigan's legs work the.
He is the kingpin.

556
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:29,860
Jesus Christ.
That's a dark thing to do,

557
00:22:29,861 --> 00:22:31,720
man.
To have some fucking Dumbo.

558
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:32,860
And the way they describe it,
the movie,

559
00:22:32,861 --> 00:22:37,861
it's even funnier that the guy.
He's the guy is he hires are fucking 

560
00:22:37,861 --> 00:22:39,510
brain dead.
Fucking brain dead dudes.

561
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:41,980
Imagine thinking there's nothing go 
wrong with that plan.

562
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:47,320
That plan is going to go off.
They they claim in the movie and then 

563
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,760
their story I think to the courts were 
always.

564
00:22:48,761 --> 00:22:53,761
They were supposed to threaten her and 
these two dumbbells went up there and 

565
00:22:53,761 --> 00:22:53,761
they were like,
yeah,

566
00:22:53,761 --> 00:22:55,150
we'll threatened her.
And they were like,

567
00:22:55,151 --> 00:22:55,390
no,
no.

568
00:22:55,391 --> 00:22:57,240
Threatened her.
You're like her.

569
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,710
They fucking shows up with a police 
baton.

570
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:01,600
You believe that?
No Dude,

571
00:23:01,601 --> 00:23:02,980
no chance,
no chance.

572
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:08,070
You know what I believe?
I believe if I'm going to believe that 

573
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:08,070
guy side,
I bet he said,

574
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:09,670
go up there and and scare and do what 
you need to do.

575
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:11,170
Right?
I bet he left it vague and was like,

576
00:23:11,171 --> 00:23:12,370
these fucking idiots.
We'll figure it out.

577
00:23:12,371 --> 00:23:14,330
I bet they were on meth and there were 
all good.

578
00:23:14,331 --> 00:23:15,620
Yeah.
Fucking geeked out.

579
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:19,740
Yeah.
They're all just geeking out going,

580
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:20,650
dude.
You know what?

581
00:23:20,651 --> 00:23:24,040
Fucking skaters need.
Knees will fuck up her knees and they're

582
00:23:24,041 --> 00:23:24,630
just like,
yeah,

583
00:23:24,631 --> 00:23:26,080
I'm taking a math.
Did you see the video?

584
00:23:26,081 --> 00:23:29,950
That guy who drove into the parking lot 
of the comedy store and smash into a car

585
00:23:29,951 --> 00:23:31,360
and almost hit one of the guys that were
there.

586
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:36,630
When was this real recently?
Some fucking dude tweaked out of his 

587
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:40,711
mind.
He came driving through the back of the 

588
00:23:40,711 --> 00:23:42,040
parking lot in the store during the day,
slammed into a car,

589
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:44,740
slammed into one of the employees 
because it was parked back there.

590
00:23:44,741 --> 00:23:45,980
They got security camera footage of

591
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,630
it.
Guys are jumping out of the way.

592
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:49,280
This guy's just like completely out of 
his mind.

593
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:51,170
Holy Shit.
It turns out the guy,

594
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:55,190
um,
years ago killed a kid driving.

595
00:23:55,470 --> 00:24:00,470
Yeah.
Slammed his car into some fucking kid 

596
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:01,190
and killed him like a young girl.
Fuck.

597
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:04,610
And then many years later is still 
driving fucked up.

598
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,880
Holy Shit.
Tried to back out.

599
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,230
Tried to get out of there.
That stopped.

600
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:09,830
Grabbed him?
Yeah.

601
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:15,130
What is this?
This the guy arrested after vehicle 

602
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:15,130
collision at the comedy store?
Yeah.

603
00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:18,200
That guy killed a kid driving and he's 
still doing it.

604
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:23,370
He killed.
He was peeling off a sunset and it 

605
00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:23,370
smashed into the comedy store.
He was out of his mind,

606
00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:25,670
man out of his mind,
came in sideways,

607
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:29,330
went around the corner,
and we went through the driveway,

608
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:34,480
went around the corner to the lot and 
came in like literally turned sideways 

609
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:34,940
and slammed into a car.

610
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:40,000
What the fuck drugs do to the wrong kind
of drugs or who knows what kind of pills

611
00:24:41,421 --> 00:24:45,560
that's fucking assholes on,
but that same guy had killed a kid.

612
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:48,110
He's still driving like that pump.
Imagine.

613
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,780
Imagine you kill a kid driving fucked 
up.

614
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:53,450
You get out of jail and then you're 
still doing it.

615
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:54,680
Yeah.
What the fuck?

616
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:56,760
He's not even that old.
He looked at me.

617
00:24:56,770 --> 00:24:58,850
He looked like a lot of young.
Here's the thing,

618
00:24:58,851 --> 00:25:01,220
man.
Somebody made that kid so many made that

619
00:25:01,221 --> 00:25:06,221
kid.
Somebody somebody fuck somebody and the 

620
00:25:06,221 --> 00:25:06,221
man,
the woman got together,

621
00:25:06,221 --> 00:25:07,730
they got pregnant,
the girl got pregnant,

622
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:10,580
gave birth.
Raise that kid and this is what you got.

623
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:12,860
What a bad deal.
But you can't tell me that.

624
00:25:12,861 --> 00:25:17,861
That's not part of their fault too.
There's got to be some shit that they 

625
00:25:17,861 --> 00:25:17,861
fucking did have that kid.
Yeah.

626
00:25:17,861 --> 00:25:17,861
Oh,
for sure.

627
00:25:17,861 --> 00:25:19,220
There's got to be something.
I mean,

628
00:25:19,221 --> 00:25:20,600
that's a.
that's a collective effort.

629
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:25,630
You get someone that's that fucking 
stupid that you kill a kid and you don't

630
00:25:25,971 --> 00:25:28,400
learn like that's not enough of a 
lesson.

631
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:33,580
You're still driving fucked up.
How did Caitlin Jenner get away with 

632
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:36,221
killing that dude?
What was the turned into a woman that 

633
00:25:36,221 --> 00:25:36,221
was the best?
Just slice off your Dick.

634
00:25:36,221 --> 00:25:36,980
That's it.
If us,

635
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:40,490
they can't get.
You know what it is,

636
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:42,590
man.
In this day and age,

637
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:47,680
it's like she entered into this category
of the most marginalized group in 

638
00:25:48,231 --> 00:25:53,231
America currently,
which is transgender people and doing 

639
00:25:53,231 --> 00:25:57,191
that by becoming a transgender person.
That became the entire focus of the 

640
00:25:57,191 --> 00:26:00,881
nation.
She got exonerated for all of these 

641
00:26:00,881 --> 00:26:02,771
things though,
so I wasn't paying attention and she 

642
00:26:02,771 --> 00:26:05,381
slammed into the back.
All we can say he because it was still a

643
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:10,660
Bruce Jenner.
He slammed into the back of this 

644
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:10,660
person's car.

645
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:10,660
It was a dude,
but it was a single.

646
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:11,480
Oh,
it was a woman.

647
00:26:11,481 --> 00:26:14,840
Woman slammed into an old lady and 
pushed her into traffic.

648
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:19,990
Fuck.
Than they hit a car with a family of 

649
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:21,050
five members.
Two kids and a grandma and way they live

650
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:26,240
the same family,
but the grandma sued because she like 

651
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,020
broke her hip and pelvis or something 
like 79 year old woman.

652
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,390
Yeah.
It's a fucked up story and it was almost

653
00:26:29,391 --> 00:26:34,391
like it just disappeared.
Crazy thing is Caitlin doesn't even 

654
00:26:34,391 --> 00:26:37,811
address it.
Like it's like some horrific moment in 

655
00:26:37,811 --> 00:26:37,811
their life.
No,

656
00:26:37,811 --> 00:26:40,340
completely irresponsible,
but it shows you the type of person.

657
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:42,710
Do you ever see Kyle Dunnigan staying on
it?

658
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:44,010
Nigger,
it's

659
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:49,010
the funniest.
But have you ever see the one he did on 

660
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:49,010
that will engender CBF finance?
Oh No.

661
00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:54,130
Where he's driving fucking fucked up and
killed that lady.

662
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:59,940
But now Caitlin has got a clean record.
Hey Dude.

663
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:05,490
Done again.
That is such a fucking hysterical 

664
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:07,160
character character that he does on his 
instagram everyday.

665
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:07,860
I watched that shit.
Yeah,

666
00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:08,610
here it is.
Play it.

667
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:15,240
I got my driver's license back.
Fuck me when he killed that lady with 

668
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:18,750
the Chicago.
Carolyn's got a clean record.

669
00:27:18,751 --> 00:27:21,730
Bad Man.
I'm a much better driver then bro.

670
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,760
Show.
Don't be afraid to hit the streets.

671
00:27:25,690 --> 00:27:27,260
Look,
I just hit a retarded kid.

672
00:27:31,810 --> 00:27:33,880
He's such an odd guy.
I love it.

673
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:35,440
He's very,
very funny.

674
00:27:35,441 --> 00:27:36,580
That's where that comes from,
man.

675
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,490
There's beauty in that fucking oddity.
Oh,

676
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:40,390
I love that.
Well,

677
00:27:40,391 --> 00:27:43,730
he found his groove groove is instagram 
with face swap.

678
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:45,040
Yup.
He's brilliant.

679
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:48,460
He's got the funniest instagram page by 
far.

680
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,630
I do.
When he fucks with his mom,

681
00:27:49,631 --> 00:27:50,950
it makes me.
It kills.

682
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:52,810
Maybe you seen him do that,
Craig,

683
00:27:52,811 --> 00:27:53,650
is that.
Guess what?

684
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:55,450
Guess what?
Get she.

685
00:27:55,451 --> 00:28:00,451
You can tell she's so fucking.
She's on the phone like on a business 

686
00:28:00,451 --> 00:28:00,451
call and she's like,
I'm on the phone.

687
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:02,210
He doesn't give a fuck.
He keeps bugging.

688
00:28:02,270 --> 00:28:03,400
It's so funny,
man.

689
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:06,590
Chicken.
But it does it.

690
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:07,840
That great character.
You know,

691
00:28:07,841 --> 00:28:09,850
people are mad at him for that Craig 
character.

692
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:10,690
Why?
Of course,

693
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,820
with the flux new.
He's being an ableist.

694
00:28:12,910 --> 00:28:15,520
Oh my God.
Oh my list.

695
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:20,610
You being unable list passed by chick 
fil a new chick filet near me this 

696
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:22,000
morning.
Uh,

697
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:23,980
the vegans are protesting.
Oh wait,

698
00:28:23,981 --> 00:28:25,600
this sim destroying his mother's pain.

699
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:30,670
But handbag dealer call her the 
hamburglar in case you're in that.

700
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:33,670
Sorry,

701
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:46,250
I'm just fixing the painting.
Painting the dough on that doesn't make 

702
00:28:47,291 --> 00:28:48,070
any sense.

703
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:54,340
You haven't even seen it yet.
Maybe you'll like it better.

704
00:28:57,650 --> 00:29:02,650
Sure.
Does the smartstack much.

705
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:18,120
I'm just going to cut out the cookie.
Men look pretty much the same

706
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:31,330
drugs did school.
I wish it hadn't every podcast here that

707
00:29:31,331 --> 00:29:34,980
sell drugs to school.
Oh my God.

708
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:37,030
These kids.
That kills it.

709
00:29:37,031 --> 00:29:39,470
Kills me every fucking time already.
So funny man.

710
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,390
Every time you post something with that,
great fuck.

711
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:46,400
It rips me up.
But it's funny how he found this niche 

712
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,010
and that,
that this,

713
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:51,730
this new thing of like face swap with a 
character.

714
00:29:51,731 --> 00:29:52,630
It's Pr.
It's perfect.

715
00:29:52,631 --> 00:29:54,130
Well,
it's perfect because his impressions are

716
00:29:54,131 --> 00:29:55,210
so good.
Oh,

717
00:29:55,211 --> 00:29:58,450
that's so fucking Bill Maher is insane.
Oh my God.

718
00:29:58,451 --> 00:30:00,760
It's so good.
It's really creepy when I see.

719
00:30:00,761 --> 00:30:01,420
When you see it,
you're like,

720
00:30:01,421 --> 00:30:06,421
that's bill Maher behind the face.
Swap doing the voice when he does the 

721
00:30:06,431 --> 00:30:09,400
Kim and Kanye talking,
talking to each other with Caitlin.

722
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:10,840
Yeah.
It's brilliant,

723
00:30:10,841 --> 00:30:11,830
man.
He's a fucking.

724
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:14,110
He.
He found he found the perfect group,

725
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:17,680
but I love the fact that there's this 
new thing that people can do.

726
00:30:17,730 --> 00:30:18,560
You know,
the,

727
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:22,930
this face swap thing is like a 
completely new way of doing sketches,

728
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,460
making characters.
Yeah.

729
00:30:24,461 --> 00:30:29,461
It's wild.
It's almost funny earlier because you 

730
00:30:29,461 --> 00:30:31,150
know that he's behind it.
You know what I mean?

731
00:30:31,151 --> 00:30:34,840
It's like you're in on it so you know,
but yet it's so good.

732
00:30:34,841 --> 00:30:37,330
Like when he does like Kim and Kanye 
West,

733
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:39,390
Dad,
dad,

734
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:42,320
I'm lost in my house.
Oh Shit,

735
00:30:42,530 --> 00:30:44,210
look around you.
What do you say?

736
00:30:44,390 --> 00:30:47,960
There's a washing machine is a weird 
white box.

737
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:52,990
What is that white box?
But it's so perfect.

738
00:30:55,431 --> 00:31:00,431
It's like clueless family that's so 
wealthy that they completely detached 

739
00:31:00,431 --> 00:31:01,770
from.
What is that white box?

740
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:02,850
Really mad now

741
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:08,760
I just love that these technologies 
created.

742
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,920
There's a bunch of youtube people that 
do that.

743
00:31:10,921 --> 00:31:12,720
They're doing ladies weird youtube 
videos.

744
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:16,650
There's so many people doing it now,
but it's like he but he's found a,

745
00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:19,770
like a real specifically funny niche 
because he's.

746
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:24,780
Because he's related to the characters,
like a lot of times when people are 

747
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:27,711
thrown characters together and sketches 
and they're just kinda so cheaply done 

748
00:31:27,711 --> 00:31:30,681
and they don't have any.
Like they don't mean comedic base that 

749
00:31:30,681 --> 00:31:31,230
just like weird to be fucking goofy and 
it's like,

750
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:33,540
ah,
you got to have some kind of basement.

751
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:36,930
There's a few people that do it right.
My kid loves this lady,

752
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:39,150
Miranda sings.
Do you know that?

753
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,710
That is.
She's this.

754
00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:43,740
She's got this show called the fuck.
We'll show a picture.

755
00:31:43,741 --> 00:31:45,240
Miranda sings.
Yeah.

756
00:31:45,241 --> 00:31:46,890
I think that's her name.
Isn't that her name?

757
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:47,550
What does she do?

758
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:49,980
I try to get her on the podcast.
Did Not respond at all.

759
00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:51,870
That's so fun.
Do it just for my daughter.

760
00:31:53,610 --> 00:31:57,780
She's so into this lady's show,
but it's a show that's not for kids.

761
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:00,510
That's her.
It's a weird show.

762
00:32:00,511 --> 00:32:01,360
Like the show.
I'm like.

763
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:03,990
She had.
She had a Netflix show.

764
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:04,600
She.
Yeah.

765
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:06,090
Is it over?
Did they cancel it?

766
00:32:06,091 --> 00:32:07,440
I don't know if it was a movie or a 
show.

767
00:32:07,441 --> 00:32:10,010
Actually I might bunk Ronkin kid loved 
that show and I was.

768
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:11,700
I was watching it with a gun.
The movie one?

769
00:32:11,701 --> 00:32:13,970
Yeah.
What does that haters back back off?

770
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,570
That's what it's called.
Haters back off.

771
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,370
Is that a movie or a show?
It's a show.

772
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:19,350
Yeah.
Play the trailer,

773
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:24,650
Ben,
humiliating.

774
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:28,800
They whole family left you sure this 
time?

775
00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:32,720
I'm sure he'll be fine.
Right?

776
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:35,490
Right now you're just a boring famous 
person.

777
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:38,100
We need to get you to.
Great.

778
00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:40,120
It's where mentions are boring.

779
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:46,060
I don't let him slap her daughter who's 
eight.

780
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:50,920
We'll do an impression.
Not Thought Mermaids.

781
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:53,450
She'll like.
She does that voice,

782
00:32:53,451 --> 00:32:58,451
that voice that she does to show like.
It's almost like a tim and Eric type 

783
00:32:58,451 --> 00:33:02,021
show.
It's not really a show for eight year 

784
00:33:02,021 --> 00:33:02,021
olds.
It's just a mind fuck show.

785
00:33:02,021 --> 00:33:04,230
Yeah.
So I'm like letting her watch and like,

786
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:05,930
I don't even think you should be 
watching this,

787
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:08,710
but then again she lives with me.
Yeah,

788
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,280
no shit.
He's going to say what?

789
00:33:10,281 --> 00:33:15,281
But what did you watch that you knew you
shouldn't have been watching when you 

790
00:33:15,281 --> 00:33:17,351
were a kid?
To try to not swear for the first five 

791
00:33:17,351 --> 00:33:17,351
years of their life and then I'm like,
impossible.

792
00:33:17,351 --> 00:33:19,820
Stop.
My wife would get mad.

793
00:33:19,821 --> 00:33:24,821
I'm like,
what are they going to learn about 

794
00:33:24,821 --> 00:33:24,821
something early?
He has a shit.

795
00:33:24,821 --> 00:33:27,341
I'm nice.
They'll just showcasing I say shit or 

796
00:33:27,341 --> 00:33:27,341
fuck,
what's the big deal?

797
00:33:27,341 --> 00:33:28,860
I don't say like,
I'm going to fuck you to my wife.

798
00:33:28,861 --> 00:33:30,050
I'm real.
Fuck you lady.

799
00:33:30,290 --> 00:33:33,080
I don't say that in front of your kids 
are eating dinner.

800
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:35,460
I'm going to fuck your late night.
I'm fucking you guys.

801
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:38,450
Your mom fucking ghetto.
I made you.

802
00:33:39,610 --> 00:33:41,930
You're upset.
It's how I fucking made you.

803
00:33:42,570 --> 00:33:44,850
That's where you came from.
My Duck.

804
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,120
There was a moment when my daughter was 
three.

805
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:49,340
We were skiing and we packed up all the 
stuff.

806
00:33:49,341 --> 00:33:54,341
We're getting ready to leave,
but we didn't pack up her helmet and so 

807
00:33:54,341 --> 00:33:54,341
we got all that stuff back.
We got everything.

808
00:33:54,341 --> 00:33:55,520
Got Everything.
Oh,

809
00:33:55,610 --> 00:33:57,020
the helmet.
I go,

810
00:33:57,021 --> 00:34:02,021
we haven't packed the helmet and my 
three year old daughter looks at the 

811
00:34:02,021 --> 00:34:02,021
helmet,
looks at her bag and goes,

812
00:34:02,021 --> 00:34:05,470
shit,
that's great.

813
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:08,080
But there's a moment where like,
oh no.

814
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:10,820
And we're laughing,
but we try not to look at it like,

815
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,390
Oh,
turn it away laughing.

816
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:16,850
Listen.
It's like those videos on the Internet.

817
00:34:16,851 --> 00:34:19,550
Always funny when there's a kid trying 
to say duck and they're like,

818
00:34:19,551 --> 00:34:20,630
what is he like,
fuck,

819
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:21,830
fuck.
And you're like,

820
00:34:21,850 --> 00:34:22,760
it's fine.
I don't give a fuck.

821
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:27,790
It's funny.
There was no way the parent can't not 

822
00:34:27,790 --> 00:34:27,790
laugh,
but he's like,

823
00:34:27,790 --> 00:34:27,790
fuck the fuck.
And they're like,

824
00:34:27,790 --> 00:34:31,601
yeah,
the dog is a girl told me he tried to 

825
00:34:31,601 --> 00:34:32,240
kiss his son is his three year old and 
he's like,

826
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:35,270
he goes up,
like give daddy a kiss and it says no,

827
00:34:35,271 --> 00:34:36,020
no,
no push.

828
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:38,300
He pushes him away.
But as he pushes him away,

829
00:34:38,301 --> 00:34:39,340
says push.
No,

830
00:34:39,341 --> 00:34:39,590
no,
no.

831
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:40,500
Push,
push,

832
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:41,690
push,
push,

833
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,670
push,
push.

834
00:34:43,671 --> 00:34:47,250
Get away from me.
Homo Baghdad.

835
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:52,700
Push Push.
What are you going to make?

836
00:34:52,701 --> 00:34:57,701
Little Sandino's try and man,
are you shooting some loads in there 

837
00:34:57,701 --> 00:34:59,160
pumping?
Why not?

838
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,560
Why not?
What's the difference?

839
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:01,930
Live rounds.

840
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:05,520
So you guys doing the thing where you 
like checking the calendar should have.

841
00:35:05,521 --> 00:35:08,450
So that's such a weird thing too.
I think it's a mental thing as well that

842
00:35:08,451 --> 00:35:10,040
gets in the way.
Banger every night.

843
00:35:10,041 --> 00:35:12,240
Pump banger every night.
Yeah,

844
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,190
let the fucking chips fall where they 
may.

845
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,820
True.
You know what you gotta do?

846
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:19,730
Eat mixed nuts.
Literally nuts make you nuts.

847
00:35:19,731 --> 00:35:21,230
Grow nuts.
Yeah.

848
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:26,440
I'm fucking Dr Rhonda.
Patrick posted something on our twitter 

849
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:26,440
page the other day about it.
She was like,

850
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:27,620
just fucking nuts.
Help help sperm production.

851
00:35:27,621 --> 00:35:29,390
Say it that way.
She's like scientific.

852
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:29,930
She's like,
yo,

853
00:35:29,931 --> 00:35:31,130
bro,
fucking nuts.

854
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:34,770
You fucking just flow.
You want juice,

855
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:39,790
you got to eat a lot of nuts.
But apparently if you eat a certain 

856
00:35:39,790 --> 00:35:42,090
amount of grams of see if he could find 
the tweet.

857
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:44,070
Certain a certain percentage helps you 
out.

858
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:48,870
Certain like quantity of mixed nuts 
makes your balls grow,

859
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:51,050
literally makes your sperm increase.

860
00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:56,070
What makes your ball shrink?
There's got to be a food that does the 

861
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:56,070
opposite of steroids.
Yeah.

862
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:56,580
I stopped eating those,
uh,

863
00:35:56,581 --> 00:35:59,520
years ago.
It makes your uh,

864
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:02,970
your balls shrink because your balls 
aren't making any testosterone anymore.

865
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:08,030
But my,
I asked the doctor and he said that it 

866
00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:09,891
doesn't,
it doesn't reduce the amount of semen 

867
00:36:09,891 --> 00:36:10,260
you produce.
It makes your physical nuts smaller.

868
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,970
Does your doctor son?
He said you can.

869
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:17,030
Yeah,
because I asked him about a different 

870
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:17,030
doctor.
Yeah,

871
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:18,750
I met him at trader Joe's parking lot.
He was a good doctor.

872
00:36:18,930 --> 00:36:22,650
He had like one of those little stands.
This is why you're nuts or swallow.

873
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:25,340
He made me show.
I showed him my nuts.

874
00:36:25,341 --> 00:36:27,240
He maybe I let him hold him.
He had to inspect them.

875
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:29,880
Are put gloves on.
She put the.

876
00:36:29,881 --> 00:36:31,400
Put them in my mouth and I'll tell you 
what.

877
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:31,830
What's wrong

878
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:34,750
mom?

879
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:39,960
Do you have a girl that put.
Put your nuts in her mouth in the and 

880
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:40,610
home.
Look,

881
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:45,620
a monk makes your brain.
She put my nuts like a wildebeest.

882
00:36:47,890 --> 00:36:51,360
Oh.
Oh,

883
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:53,040
nutmeg.

884
00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:55,930
It will make you feel weird because it's
such a deep sound.

885
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:58,240
You'd be like,
why am I coming to this deep sound?

886
00:37:00,090 --> 00:37:04,480
No.
Then he'd get an imprint like deep sound

887
00:37:04,481 --> 00:37:08,470
coming noises like baby.
Then it's Pamela noise for me.

888
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:10,570
Deeper,
deeper,

889
00:37:10,571 --> 00:37:11,110
deeper,
deeper,

890
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:13,520
deeper.
Once you make a deal,

891
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:18,750
what the fuck do you mean?
Like I dude sound like a dude like a 

892
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:22,081
dog.
And you shoot the hardest loads,

893
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:29,710
man.
That supplemented their diet with 60 

894
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:32,251
grams of mixed nuts daily for 14 weeks,
increased their sperm count by 16 

895
00:37:32,251 --> 00:37:35,881
percent of the shit sperm vitality by 
four percent and sperm motility by six 

896
00:37:36,581 --> 00:37:39,580
percent according to a randomized 
controlled trial.

897
00:37:39,610 --> 00:37:44,610
This controlled trial was.
My husband does a cup and dudes just 

898
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:49,710
into it every day for 14 weeks.
What you got going on this week,

899
00:37:51,521 --> 00:37:53,560
man,
badge isn't into cup with mixed.

900
00:37:53,561 --> 00:37:55,730
I mean mixed nuts and shit tight you 
get.

901
00:37:55,830 --> 00:38:00,830
Instead,
let's make a deal with this guy in this 

902
00:38:00,830 --> 00:38:03,751
study.
Like you can't come at all except for 

903
00:38:03,751 --> 00:38:07,921
the study in the cup or otherwise we're 
not going to know because if you're 

904
00:38:07,921 --> 00:38:09,070
banging all day one day and the next day
you don't do anything.

905
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,030
You're tired.
Come Sad.

906
00:38:13,031 --> 00:38:15,250
Lazy Cup comes,
comes out different.

907
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:17,450
I don't know if anybody knows,
but you ever take a few days off,

908
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:19,440
beaten off.
Hey and then you beat off and it's like,

909
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:21,010
Hey,
put a hole in the ceiling.

910
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:26,470
It's flying all over the place.
If I'm jerking off too much and it just 

911
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:28,600
kind of dribbles out,
you feel like I'll lose or hey,

912
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,330
I feel very depressed if my com volumes 
low.

913
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:34,930
Like if I beat off and it's just like 
think she said why did I do?

914
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:37,060
Why?
Why?

915
00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:43,170
Why?
I find it always depends on how much I 

916
00:38:43,170 --> 00:38:43,170
build up.
If I'm building up to it,

917
00:38:43,170 --> 00:38:43,360
I get a big one.

918
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:44,070
Build A.
Oh,

919
00:38:44,071 --> 00:38:48,280
you edge fucking pervert.
I didn't know about etching.

920
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:49,740
It's fucking awesome.
Norton had.

921
00:38:49,741 --> 00:38:53,080
Tell me about it.
Does he edges he edge with prostitutes?

922
00:38:53,470 --> 00:38:55,810
He'd get a prostitute and you'd get 
right to the porn and come and go.

923
00:38:55,811 --> 00:38:58,300
All right,
thanks for call another one next.

924
00:38:58,590 --> 00:38:59,950
Yeah.
Why not get another prostitute?

925
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:01,060
When was this?
How long ago?

926
00:39:01,530 --> 00:39:02,570
Like yesterday.
Now.

927
00:39:02,610 --> 00:39:04,120
When was this one?
Was the prostitutes?

928
00:39:04,330 --> 00:39:05,170
Oh,
Norton's.

929
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:06,610
Still similar.
Yeah,

930
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:07,280
still.
Yeah.

931
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:12,190
Darden's an animal bro.
That doesn't give a fuck.

932
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:17,250
He does give a fuck,
but he doesn't give a fuck at the same 

933
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:17,250
time.
Like secretly.

934
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:17,250
Secretly when they leave.
Yeah,

935
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:18,160
he's been the fuck out.
Yeah.

936
00:39:18,161 --> 00:39:20,860
He gets disgusted with themselves,
but that's what he enjoys.

937
00:39:21,010 --> 00:39:22,840
I feel like he should be free.
You know the,

938
00:39:22,841 --> 00:39:23,540
the,
there's like a,

939
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:26,530
there's some guy I was reading 
something.

940
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:30,520
Some guy was doing something on anti 
shame things as a doctor.

941
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:33,250
Like fuck.
Shame was like is his thing.

942
00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:38,310
But that shame is a weird thing.
Like there's things that people are 

943
00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:40,390
ashamed of that we're not ashamed of.
It all like sex,

944
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,600
like it,
like normal sex,

945
00:39:43,601 --> 00:39:48,601
like say if your wife's walking around 
the house at a pair of shorts and you 

946
00:39:48,601 --> 00:39:48,601
grab her ass and she,
you know,

947
00:39:48,601 --> 00:39:53,070
and she turns around,
she smiles at you and the two of you 

948
00:39:53,070 --> 00:39:53,070
start banging.
That's fine.

949
00:39:53,070 --> 00:39:53,070
Yes.
No.

950
00:39:53,070 --> 00:39:54,790
Are you married?
You're going to love each other.

951
00:39:54,791 --> 00:39:56,350
You've,
you're attracted to each other.

952
00:39:56,351 --> 00:39:57,310
It's all normal.
Right?

953
00:39:57,430 --> 00:40:02,430
But if you lived in like a crazy 
religious household where she supposed 

954
00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:02,650
to be dressed like a fucking table 
cloth,

955
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:06,070
that would be a real problem.
He would,

956
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:09,370
she would feel awful.
She would feel ashamed.

957
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:12,730
So it's like what causes shame?
Cultural acceptance.

958
00:40:12,731 --> 00:40:13,800
Right.
And well,

959
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,450
and the building blocks of how your 
race,

960
00:40:15,490 --> 00:40:15,670
right?

961
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:20,670
Like some people get shamed for from 
their parents for stuff that's they 

962
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:20,670
shouldn't feel ashamed about.
Oh yeah,

963
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:21,730
for sure.
Yeah.

964
00:40:21,731 --> 00:40:26,731
And for Norton.
So he pays these nice ladies to touch 

965
00:40:26,731 --> 00:40:26,731
his penis and that's why they don't have
to work at Denny's.

966
00:40:26,731 --> 00:40:28,940
But they still do.
Yeah.

967
00:40:28,990 --> 00:40:33,990
That's their shifting their break.
They go on a smoke break and go to edge 

968
00:40:33,990 --> 00:40:36,500
him for an hour and a half dishwasher.
Hands Kinda like real rink,

969
00:40:36,501 --> 00:40:38,920
like really,
really strong fingerprints,

970
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:43,980
you know what I mean?
Fucking indentation on his really 

971
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:45,120
strong,
like the,

972
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:50,190
you know,
the lines and the fingerprints that 

973
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:51,160
deeper than normal.
The grooved all chemicals.

974
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:53,170
Dishwasher,
washing all day.

975
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:54,920
What did,
what does he tell you or cost of?

976
00:40:54,970 --> 00:40:57,430
How much money do you spend on hookers?
I'm,

977
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,130
well,
I don't know.

978
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:01,180
He's never really.
He's a wealthy guy,

979
00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:02,920
so it's not a problem.
That's the.

980
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:08,020
That's part of the problem.
Part of the problem is that it's not a 

981
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:08,020
problem.
He's so successful.

982
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:10,060
You know,
Jim sells out comedy shows everywhere.

983
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:13,660
He's got a Sirius xm show.
He's written books.

984
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,700
He's got plenty of money for hookers.
So he's like,

985
00:41:15,701 --> 00:41:20,230
fuck it here.
He's like the most free guy that I know.

986
00:41:20,231 --> 00:41:23,400
In terms of like talking about his 
weirdness and his perversion.

987
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:25,030
Is he sober?
Yes,

988
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:26,980
he has been since he was like really 
young.

989
00:41:27,210 --> 00:41:27,820
Yeah,
yeah,

990
00:41:27,821 --> 00:41:32,821
yeah.
He had a problem and he got sober I 

991
00:41:32,821 --> 00:41:32,821
think when he was 19.
Holy Shit.

992
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,370
He's been sober the entire time.

993
00:41:34,790 --> 00:41:36,100
That's fucking mile.
Yeah.

994
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:38,060
Everyone's got advice.
Yeah.

995
00:41:38,090 --> 00:41:40,520
Well his vices.
It's a strong one,

996
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:43,910
but it's like trannies.
He's really into trannies for real.

997
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:44,580
Yeah.
Yeah.

998
00:41:44,810 --> 00:41:45,550
Good for him.
Whatever.

999
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:50,580
Whatever the fuck.
He says it like you're not supposed to 

1000
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:50,580
say it anymore.
Like I just,

1001
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:51,050
I guess just got in trouble.
Oh Dude.

1002
00:41:51,051 --> 00:41:53,320
I got fucking lit up for that online.
I,

1003
00:41:53,330 --> 00:41:54,210
I didn't,
I,

1004
00:41:54,510 --> 00:41:59,510
I was with gay friends at a.
What I put online,

1005
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:01,730
having the most fun at a Mexican,
20 bucks.

1006
00:42:01,790 --> 00:42:04,610
People leave me the fuck up that it's 
not,

1007
00:42:04,611 --> 00:42:05,430
that's not a word.
We.

1008
00:42:05,490 --> 00:42:06,320
I was like,
okay.

1009
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,870
I was with gay dudes that they joked 
about it with me.

1010
00:42:08,871 --> 00:42:10,970
I thought it was okay.
It's a,

1011
00:42:11,330 --> 00:42:14,450
you can say transvestite.
You can't say tranny.

1012
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,880
Justin Martin.
Dale can say whatever he wants.

1013
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:18,710
He does.
He can.

1014
00:42:18,790 --> 00:42:19,580
Yeah.
Yeah,

1015
00:42:19,581 --> 00:42:24,581
he does.
He says whatever the fuck he wants 

1016
00:42:24,581 --> 00:42:24,581
because he's a flamboyant gay guy.

1017
00:42:24,581 --> 00:42:24,581
Yeah.
He can get away with it.

1018
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:26,840
He does.
He gets away with.

1019
00:42:26,990 --> 00:42:28,360
He says fucking every.
Yeah,

1020
00:42:28,370 --> 00:42:31,010
but like a flamboyant gay guy could say 
that no one says shit,

1021
00:42:31,011 --> 00:42:33,830
but a straight white guy from Chicago 
done you asshole.

1022
00:42:33,831 --> 00:42:36,060
You piece of shit.
Fucking ask Justin Mernda.

1023
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:38,000
He yells the n word all the time 
constantly.

1024
00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:40,100
I didn't know that.
No he doesn't,

1025
00:42:40,101 --> 00:42:42,290
but I just wanted to put that up there.
Tell him stop.

1026
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:47,340
No,
I don't think you'd get that kind of 

1027
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:47,340
freedom just by being gay,
but if you were gay black guy.

1028
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:48,530
Yeah.
Then you can't.

1029
00:42:49,070 --> 00:42:49,910
Then you.
I think you're good.

1030
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:54,960
A black transgender God could do 
whatever you want with no legs and one 

1031
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,390
eye.
He's disabled.

1032
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:57,590
Gay,
black,

1033
00:42:57,591 --> 00:43:00,200
trans.
You know what's interesting?

1034
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:02,210
Nobody.
I mean,

1035
00:43:02,211 --> 00:43:06,810
no one accepts transracial can't do it.
No one except transracial.

1036
00:43:06,890 --> 00:43:08,840
That is the one thing that woman won.

1037
00:43:08,870 --> 00:43:09,980
Yeah.
Rachel Doles out.

1038
00:43:10,030 --> 00:43:14,330
Just that one line that we're not 
willing to cross no fucking way,

1039
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:17,030
which is meanwhile it is one of the most
realistic lines.

1040
00:43:17,150 --> 00:43:19,730
This is why totally human beings came 
from Africa.

1041
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:21,680
All of them will also.
Race.

1042
00:43:21,710 --> 00:43:24,620
Race has a lot to do with culture.
Oh yeah,

1043
00:43:24,621 --> 00:43:25,970
for sure.
But I mean,

1044
00:43:26,150 --> 00:43:28,360
literally all human beings came from 
Africa.

1045
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:30,840
That is the cradle of civilization.
Yeah.

1046
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:35,000
So we're all African.
So why can't you pretend to be African?

1047
00:43:35,390 --> 00:43:37,070
Why can't,
why can't you just be it?

1048
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:38,410
That's really what it is.
His name pretending.

1049
00:43:38,411 --> 00:43:39,950
If you just say,
that's what I identify with.

1050
00:43:39,951 --> 00:43:42,420
I get it.
That to me is that,

1051
00:43:42,450 --> 00:43:45,020
that's more on the other side of when 
people say like,

1052
00:43:45,021 --> 00:43:50,021
you can't,
you can't be a gender other than a male 

1053
00:43:50,021 --> 00:43:51,080
or a female.
And people say yes you can.

1054
00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:52,130
And that's accepted.

1055
00:43:52,370 --> 00:43:54,920
But if you said identify as Puerto 
Rican,

1056
00:43:56,210 --> 00:43:57,680
they're like,
no fucking way.

1057
00:43:57,681 --> 00:44:01,150
Is there any race that would let you in?
Like that is anyways?

1058
00:44:01,170 --> 00:44:01,610
Uh,
yeah.

1059
00:44:01,611 --> 00:44:03,430
Come on.
You could be a radiant.

1060
00:44:03,470 --> 00:44:07,010
I feel like redheads or like the.
I think I've got a little bit of a pass.

1061
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:10,040
He should have a pet.
We have a passengers maligned.

1062
00:44:10,070 --> 00:44:11,750
Yeah.
We have a pass ginger's.

1063
00:44:11,751 --> 00:44:13,550
Just kick a ginger dance.
South Park.

1064
00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:14,290
We're dead.
We're,

1065
00:44:14,370 --> 00:44:14,920
we're,
we're,

1066
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:18,560
we're going to be gone in like 50 years.
Everything a dying your hair now.

1067
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:20,360
I knew a dude who had red hair.
He used to dies.

1068
00:44:20,361 --> 00:44:22,580
Eyebrows.
What a fucking Weirdo man.

1069
00:44:22,581 --> 00:44:27,581
That's a weird fucking thing.
Did hair dyed his eyebrows look 

1070
00:44:27,581 --> 00:44:28,970
different because he was that sad about 
having red hair when I was a kid.

1071
00:44:29,030 --> 00:44:34,030
When I was a kid it bothered me like 
crazy and then I got and didn't give a 

1072
00:44:34,030 --> 00:44:34,030
fuck.

1073
00:44:34,030 --> 00:44:35,240
And then when you get older there are 
some women that like it that like that,

1074
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:35,880
that,
that,

1075
00:44:35,970 --> 00:44:38,700
that think that's a more attractive 
because it's real bad for them.

1076
00:44:39,050 --> 00:44:42,330
Yeah,
I think they're dumb fucking idiots.

1077
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:45,690
I know something went wrong.
It's funny.

1078
00:44:45,691 --> 00:44:48,720
Like what people,
like some people like thick ankles.

1079
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:50,530
Oh yeah,
girl.

1080
00:44:50,830 --> 00:44:52,980
Gang.
What's your weirdest specific thing that

1081
00:44:52,981 --> 00:44:57,981
you.
When you like when you first started 

1082
00:44:57,981 --> 00:44:59,721
getting into checks,
when you find it figured out what your 

1083
00:44:59,721 --> 00:44:59,721
style was,
what was the one thing you're like,

1084
00:44:59,721 --> 00:44:59,721
that's weird and most people don't like 
that about girls.

1085
00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:01,470
I don't have one.
You don't have any of that shit?

1086
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:02,300
No.
No.

1087
00:45:02,370 --> 00:45:03,870
Like some guys love cellulite.
You know?

1088
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:04,560
Some girls like,
like,

1089
00:45:04,561 --> 00:45:06,570
like,
like Chunky bitches,

1090
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:08,190
Jamie over there.

1091
00:45:11,090 --> 00:45:11,990
He's like,
Hey,

1092
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:15,300
don't talk.
He'll put that evil on me.

1093
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:18,120
He's going to have so many dms from 
these bad chicks.

1094
00:45:18,121 --> 00:45:19,220
It didn't bump.
Yeah.

1095
00:45:19,410 --> 00:45:24,410
You get your cellulite picks.
Do you know that there's a new show on 

1096
00:45:24,410 --> 00:45:24,410
Netflix and they're trying to take off 
the air.

1097
00:45:24,410 --> 00:45:28,850
It's about a girl who used to be fat and
then she got skinny and she's getting 

1098
00:45:28,850 --> 00:45:28,850
revenge on everybody.
That's fucking.

1099
00:45:28,850 --> 00:45:29,610
What's that called?
I want to watch.

1100
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:35,000
How would they take that off?
That sounds even if you find it as some 

1101
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,970
really pretty girl.
She's going back to all the people that 

1102
00:45:37,970 --> 00:45:37,970
talk shit to her when she was young 
about being fast.

1103
00:45:37,970 --> 00:45:39,570
I don't really pay attention to 100 
percent,

1104
00:45:40,110 --> 00:45:42,300
but uh,
people were very angry about it.

1105
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:45,510
About the premise.
Why fat shaming.

1106
00:45:45,570 --> 00:45:48,150
Oh Gosh.
Don't you know about fat shaming?

1107
00:45:52,860 --> 00:45:54,820
What is it called?
God.

1108
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:57,830
That girl Debbie Ryan fat phobic.
Disney is.

1109
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:58,890
Oh,
it's a fat foot.

1110
00:45:58,891 --> 00:45:59,970
Hold on a second.
Hold on.

1111
00:45:59,971 --> 00:46:00,420
Let me read that.

1112
00:46:00,450 --> 00:46:05,340
Fat phobic Netflix series supports 
damaging stereotypes for young women.

1113
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:07,710
Well,
listen,

1114
00:46:08,070 --> 00:46:10,470
I'm going to tell you guys this really,
really clearly.

1115
00:46:10,530 --> 00:46:12,990
If your children are fat,
they're eating too much sugar.

1116
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:15,510
Okay,
so that's a fact.

1117
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:17,310
Fix that.
Yeah.

1118
00:46:17,670 --> 00:46:22,670
Or try but don't.
Don't just call people fat phobic of 

1119
00:46:22,670 --> 00:46:26,931
your children.
There's a lot of nonsense that's 

1120
00:46:26,931 --> 00:46:28,200
involved in people's bodies and 
education and the.

1121
00:46:28,330 --> 00:46:32,010
The big one is what they eat has no 
bearing on what they look like.

1122
00:46:32,011 --> 00:46:33,050
That is horseshit.
Yeah,

1123
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:38,060
it's bullshit.
You didn't have giant fat people in the 

1124
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:40,200
twenties and you go back and look at 
fucking people in the twenties.

1125
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:45,500
They were all starving to death.
They were all skinny and the bread they 

1126
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:45,500
was,
you know what someone fucking told me,

1127
00:46:45,510 --> 00:46:47,240
Jordan Peterson told me this.
We got to look up.

1128
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:50,280
Look this up.
I'm emulsifiers.

1129
00:46:50,510 --> 00:46:55,510
I'm also fires.
And he was reading something about a 

1130
00:46:55,510 --> 00:46:58,761
most of fires that are used in fast 
rising yeast and in a lot of bread 

1131
00:46:58,761 --> 00:47:03,231
products are responsible for leaky gut 
and they have an impact on people's,

1132
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:07,050
uh,
sensitivities to gluten.

1133
00:47:07,350 --> 00:47:11,310
And he was saying that like emulsifiers 
or basically like fucking shampoo,

1134
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:14,170
you know,
you have oil in the water of your,

1135
00:47:14,380 --> 00:47:19,380
you know,
your wash some dishes and all that 

1136
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:20,340
greasy oil and you pour some dishwashing
soap in there and the water he goes,

1137
00:47:20,430 --> 00:47:24,330
that's in food.
Like that's a similar quality

1138
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:29,400
and that's a cost.
That's what's causing all these like a 

1139
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:29,800
gluten allergies and just a bunch of 
different that are causing it.

1140
00:47:29,830 --> 00:47:30,010
One

1141
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:34,210
of them is the more complex glutens 
because it used to be that you would get

1142
00:47:34,211 --> 00:47:37,420
like a,
like if you had wheat you would have,

1143
00:47:37,450 --> 00:47:41,560
it's like old wheat was like a small 
little sort of grain.

1144
00:47:41,561 --> 00:47:46,561
It was a smaller plant and then they,
they started changing it and as they 

1145
00:47:46,561 --> 00:47:48,670
started changing and selectively 
breeding it,

1146
00:47:48,671 --> 00:47:52,150
what they started doing it as making it 
thicker and more dense and,

1147
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:54,610
and that way you get a much higher yield
per acre.

1148
00:47:55,330 --> 00:47:59,710
But in doing so they also made it more 
difficult for your body to process.

1149
00:48:00,220 --> 00:48:01,030
Yeah.
So,

1150
00:48:01,031 --> 00:48:06,031
but he was saying that it's also the 
uses fast rising yeast and that there's 

1151
00:48:06,031 --> 00:48:07,720
emulsifiers in it.
And then I'm also,

1152
00:48:07,721 --> 00:48:09,670
fires are apparently terrible for your 
body,

1153
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:15,240
which makes sense because you go to 
fucking Italy and I know you like to go 

1154
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:16,420
to Italy and you eat some of that funk 
and pasta over there.

1155
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:17,800
It doesn't make you feel the same.

1156
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:18,530
No,
it doesn't.

1157
00:48:18,620 --> 00:48:20,030
No.
You actually don't feel as thick.

1158
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:25,120
I feel like you.
I feel way thicker when I feel dumpy 

1159
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:25,120
when I eat it back home.
Yeah,

1160
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:27,140
positive that I can buy online.
That's from Italy.

1161
00:48:27,141 --> 00:48:29,480
Fresh made pasta from there and what's 
not fresh made,

1162
00:48:29,481 --> 00:48:31,500
but it's using it.
It tastes

1163
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:33,930
better if you feel better when you need 
it.

1164
00:48:33,990 --> 00:48:34,740
Now you do.
Actually.

1165
00:48:34,750 --> 00:48:39,750
I know that sounds like a thing and an 
American traveler would say it's better 

1166
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:39,750
over there,
but it's.

1167
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:40,940
But it is true.
You know,

1168
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:42,510
you go over there,
they're not fat.

1169
00:48:42,540 --> 00:48:43,800
It's us.
If there there's someone fat,

1170
00:48:43,801 --> 00:48:44,810
it's an American.
That's what.

1171
00:48:44,830 --> 00:48:49,830
Every time I see a fat burners have a 
thousand bucks and they're from the 

1172
00:48:49,830 --> 00:48:49,830
state.

1173
00:48:49,830 --> 00:48:50,520
They've got Tiramisu,
they've got spaghetti,

1174
00:48:50,630 --> 00:48:53,090
good dessert,
and have coffee every fucking night.

1175
00:48:53,150 --> 00:48:55,790
Why aren't they fat and live for.
They live their lifestyle.

1176
00:48:55,791 --> 00:48:57,930
And their food choices,
fat,

1177
00:49:01,820 --> 00:49:03,340
fat phobic.
I'm going to,

1178
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:08,360
I'm going to purposely have two kids and
I'm going to feed one of them very 

1179
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:08,360
healthy food.
And the other one I'm just going to have

1180
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:12,320
sugary diet and just fat in the fuck out
of them just to show society what's up.

1181
00:49:13,530 --> 00:49:18,530
Dress them on to seal.
And Paul had a boat and I'm going to 

1182
00:49:18,530 --> 00:49:20,930
have a rope.
You don't have a rope through the 

1183
00:49:20,930 --> 00:49:22,331
premise of the show.
Know like the plot I guess would be one 

1184
00:49:22,581 --> 00:49:25,490
of the fat show used to be fat.
And then she lost weight.

1185
00:49:25,610 --> 00:49:27,360
She got punched in the face.
Now target or Walmart.

1186
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:29,660
Her jaw wired shut.
That's all she lost the weight.

1187
00:49:33,170 --> 00:49:35,630
Oh my God.
That is so fucked up.

1188
00:49:35,660 --> 00:49:37,370
That's fucked up.
Wait a minute.

1189
00:49:37,430 --> 00:49:40,910
Who punched her in the face?
Her Dad's eating cake.

1190
00:49:41,050 --> 00:49:43,400
Stop eating cake.
You fucking cunt.

1191
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:46,730
It worked.
Watch stupid.

1192
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:49,550
That's just stupid premise.
And then.

1193
00:49:49,551 --> 00:49:51,440
But she's getting revenge on people that
talk shit.

1194
00:49:51,441 --> 00:49:51,980
That's it,
right?

1195
00:49:51,981 --> 00:49:54,230
She's going back for vengeance on the 
people who hurt her.

1196
00:49:54,740 --> 00:49:57,320
So the idea is that girls are going to 
watch that and they're gonna want to get

1197
00:49:57,321 --> 00:50:02,321
their jaw wired shut.
They're gonna tell their friends to 

1198
00:50:02,321 --> 00:50:02,321
punch them,
break their fucking hit me with a bat,

1199
00:50:02,321 --> 00:50:03,770
right in my head.
I'm going to jump off my roof.

1200
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:08,800
There'll be a kyle dunnigan sketch that 
would be a great dentist that had hit 

1201
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:13,391
me,
hit me in the face while weight got my 

1202
00:50:13,391 --> 00:50:17,230
fucking God summer body.
But people do lose weight when they get 

1203
00:50:17,230 --> 00:50:18,320
the award.
Well,

1204
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:21,290
yeah,
you can only liquid drunk drunk her.

1205
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:23,990
It was a conflict.
Kanye,

1206
00:50:23,991 --> 00:50:25,730
when he shattered his,
you want to get in that car accident.

1207
00:50:25,731 --> 00:50:28,070
He lost all that weight and he talked it
because he couldn't eat

1208
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:30,470
anything and he was so fucked up on 
painkillers and shit.

1209
00:50:31,590 --> 00:50:32,980
Oh No,
no.

1210
00:50:32,981 --> 00:50:34,090
Thanks dude.
Fuck that shit.

1211
00:50:34,091 --> 00:50:37,000
It's weird how vulnerable your jaws 
feel.

1212
00:50:37,030 --> 00:50:39,190
That gold coast side of Saudi jaw.
Yeah.

1213
00:50:39,910 --> 00:50:40,920
It breaks so easy.
Uh,

1214
00:50:40,940 --> 00:50:43,240
so vulnerable.
I can't be more.

1215
00:50:43,241 --> 00:50:45,610
People don't crack their fucking jaw.
When I was fighting,

1216
00:50:45,820 --> 00:50:48,280
I was always.
My jaw was always sore.

1217
00:50:48,610 --> 00:50:50,920
Like you always get dinged.
Like you'd always get.

1218
00:50:51,190 --> 00:50:54,010
Inspiring.
So like you'd be chewing and eating like

1219
00:50:54,011 --> 00:50:54,940
this,
like Oh,

1220
00:50:55,830 --> 00:50:58,060
it's painful.
Jaw was always sore.

1221
00:50:58,090 --> 00:51:00,040
You feel it in your teeth.
Do you feel it?

1222
00:51:00,041 --> 00:51:05,041
And you're like where the joint is?
You gotta realize your jaw is in many 

1223
00:51:05,041 --> 00:51:05,410
ways.
Like your knee.

1224
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:06,040
Yeah.
Right.

1225
00:51:06,041 --> 00:51:08,940
Like you know your knee,
your knee gets sore,

1226
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:10,690
like Ah.
It hurts when you do that.

1227
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:13,840
When you get punched a bunch,
your jaw gets sore.

1228
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:17,050
Like when you're chewing it hurts.
What is that the worst?

1229
00:51:17,051 --> 00:51:19,580
Or is like rib,
rib content read punching worse.

1230
00:51:20,230 --> 00:51:25,230
The worst is your head always by far by 
far because it's scary and your ribs 

1231
00:51:25,241 --> 00:51:27,610
aren't scary.
It's like I've had broken ribs,

1232
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:33,080
like one of my ribs,
like on this side like sticks out more 

1233
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:33,610
because it's been cracked and it's all 
fucked up.

1234
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:38,920
I probably broke at least three ribs,
maybe more.

1235
00:51:38,921 --> 00:51:41,140
I think I broke.
I probably broke at least three.

1236
00:51:41,170 --> 00:51:41,870
I don't know.
I've,

1237
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:46,880
I've,
I've definitely had some tears in the 

1238
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:46,880
cartilage in between the ribs to 
promise.

1239
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:49,450
They don't really do much about it.
When you get a broken rib,

1240
00:51:49,451 --> 00:51:51,070
they don't put you in a cast.
You can't do shit.

1241
00:51:51,071 --> 00:51:56,071
I don't really do much about it.
You're just in fucking agony for awhile 

1242
00:51:56,071 --> 00:51:56,071
until it heals up.
I never broke ribs.

1243
00:51:56,071 --> 00:52:00,750
I don't know that.
I don't know if that painful and rip 

1244
00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:00,750
suck.
But you're still okay.

1245
00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:01,030
When your head hurts,
you're scared.

1246
00:52:01,060 --> 00:52:02,290
Oh yeah.
I've had three concussions.

1247
00:52:02,291 --> 00:52:04,050
I fucking.
How'd you get concussions?

1248
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:06,760
So all sports.
One football to basketball,

1249
00:52:07,180 --> 00:52:07,870
basketball,

1250
00:52:07,950 --> 00:52:10,860
basketball was bad.
Basketball as twice the same way.

1251
00:52:11,010 --> 00:52:12,000
Because you fall.
Yeah.

1252
00:52:12,030 --> 00:52:13,410
Bam.
Got My legs taken out from under me.

1253
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:15,450
Both toes.
Jesus Christ on my neck.

1254
00:52:15,630 --> 00:52:17,340
I'll never forget my mom tells this 
story.

1255
00:52:17,341 --> 00:52:20,130
I'll never forget my friend who's now 
passed away.

1256
00:52:20,131 --> 00:52:20,790
Sadly,
he,

1257
00:52:20,791 --> 00:52:21,570
uh,
he's gone.

1258
00:52:21,571 --> 00:52:25,530
But he called my mom and was like,
don't freak out,

1259
00:52:26,010 --> 00:52:28,210
but don't freak out.
The first words to apparent.

1260
00:52:28,290 --> 00:52:33,290
Don't freak out.
But Andrew's in the hospital and of 

1261
00:52:33,290 --> 00:52:33,290
course my mom

1262
00:52:33,290 --> 00:52:33,290
is it.

1263
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:38,010
I got my fucking knees.
I went up to get a rebound.

1264
00:52:38,250 --> 00:52:41,730
And on my way down all I just remember 
seeing the ceiling.

1265
00:52:41,850 --> 00:52:44,700
That's the last thing I remember.
My legs were oof right out from under me

1266
00:52:44,820 --> 00:52:48,030
and I hit my head so hard on the ground 
that I bounced up.

1267
00:52:48,710 --> 00:52:53,710
Everyone playing was like standing 
around in shock and I was blacking in 

1268
00:52:53,710 --> 00:52:54,210
and out,
but I was so.

1269
00:52:54,211 --> 00:52:55,770
It was so strange because you don't 
really,

1270
00:52:56,190 --> 00:52:59,280
you don't really know it right away.
You're like,

1271
00:52:59,281 --> 00:52:59,970
what's going?
I'm good.

1272
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:01,040
I'm good.
I'm good.

1273
00:53:01,050 --> 00:53:01,710
I'm walking,
I'm good,

1274
00:53:01,711 --> 00:53:02,580
I'm good.
And everybody's like,

1275
00:53:02,700 --> 00:53:03,840
sit down.
Are you okay?

1276
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:04,620
Like,
are you fucking,

1277
00:53:04,621 --> 00:53:05,340
you know,
you hurt me.

1278
00:53:05,341 --> 00:53:07,980
You could hear it from outside.
And then I sat down,

1279
00:53:08,010 --> 00:53:13,010
they had ems come and I remember like 
clear as day when the emt fucking 

1280
00:53:13,290 --> 00:53:15,570
grabbed my hand and he started to walk 
and I go,

1281
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:16,330
I'm going to follow this.

1282
00:53:16,380 --> 00:53:18,330
I'm going to fall down and pass out.
I said,

1283
00:53:18,380 --> 00:53:20,100
I don't feel good.
I'm not going to go to a black.

1284
00:53:20,340 --> 00:53:23,520
And I remember I threw up.
I barfed everywhere all over this.

1285
00:53:23,550 --> 00:53:26,280
I puked and then I woke up again in the 
hospital.

1286
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,770
That was bad.
That was the worst one I ever had.

1287
00:53:28,771 --> 00:53:33,180
I had bruised a bruise all these 
vertebrae and the doctor kept saying how

1288
00:53:33,250 --> 00:53:38,250
was inches of pressure away from 
cracking from bringing my fucking neck 

1289
00:53:38,250 --> 00:53:40,200
because all of my weight went one way.
That was bad.

1290
00:53:40,530 --> 00:53:42,600
Football was bad.
Football was helmet to helmet.

1291
00:53:42,601 --> 00:53:45,090
Shit.
That shit sucks.

1292
00:53:45,091 --> 00:53:50,091
I was a kid.
I was kicking the ball because our 

1293
00:53:50,091 --> 00:53:50,091
kicker was hurt and the kid over snapped
and went right over my head.

1294
00:53:50,091 --> 00:53:51,030
I went and grabbed me.
Soon as I turned around,

1295
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:54,930
I got fucking locked and then a guy in 
the sideline goes,

1296
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:56,910
you got your bell wrong boy.
I mean,

1297
00:53:56,911 --> 00:53:57,630
I got,
fuck it.

1298
00:53:57,631 --> 00:53:58,490
I mean,
everyone was okay.

1299
00:53:59,110 --> 00:54:01,570
They were loving it.
Fucking smart.

1300
00:54:01,970 --> 00:54:04,740
I got smoked.
I look like a fucking rag.

1301
00:54:05,110 --> 00:54:06,590
Sure.
It's.

1302
00:54:06,850 --> 00:54:10,480
It's a weird thing when people cheer.
When someone gets gravely injured.

1303
00:54:10,510 --> 00:54:15,510
Oh yeah.
People love it because it's because you 

1304
00:54:15,510 --> 00:54:15,510
[inaudible] the force of it is like,
Oh shit.

1305
00:54:15,510 --> 00:54:17,710
It looks incredible to see.
Let me think about fights.

1306
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:18,610
Same thing.
Yeah.

1307
00:54:18,690 --> 00:54:22,510
I mean when someone gets head kick 
fucking insane,

1308
00:54:23,140 --> 00:54:25,180
you can't believe you're watching it.
That's why the human,

1309
00:54:25,570 --> 00:54:26,700
the human emotion of like

1310
00:54:27,250 --> 00:54:30,590
it could be fucking dead soon.
Like the most disturbing ones I ever saw

1311
00:54:30,591 --> 00:54:35,591
was Francis and knocked out Alistair 
overeem with this fucking left hook 

1312
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:40,030
uppercut combination.
Sent his head like literally he was like

1313
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:45,040
looking at his asshole,
snapped his head back so far it was 

1314
00:54:45,530 --> 00:54:48,170
fucking her.
And he literally flatlined.

1315
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:51,230
Yeah.
I just flatlined leg legs,

1316
00:54:51,260 --> 00:54:54,740
spread out,
toes curled one punch.

1317
00:54:54,741 --> 00:54:59,741
And it was,
it was so powerful and so horrific that 

1318
00:54:59,741 --> 00:54:59,741
I was like,
yeah,

1319
00:54:59,741 --> 00:55:00,930
you can't help but go,
Oh God,

1320
00:55:03,530 --> 00:55:04,420
yeah.
And,

1321
00:55:04,430 --> 00:55:09,430
but see,
people are cheering for someone getting 

1322
00:55:09,430 --> 00:55:09,430
horribly injured.

1323
00:55:09,430 --> 00:55:09,430
Well,
I had a moment at,

1324
00:55:09,430 --> 00:55:12,200
at UFC two to five and that's what it 
was in Chicago.

1325
00:55:12,260 --> 00:55:17,260
I had a moment where I'm sitting on the 
floor and I was looking around and Tony 

1326
00:55:17,260 --> 00:55:17,770
and I were um,
you know,

1327
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:18,440
it was uh,
it was,

1328
00:55:18,530 --> 00:55:20,300
it was between fights and Tony and Tony 
goes,

1329
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:22,160
this fucking awesome man.
And I go,

1330
00:55:22,161 --> 00:55:24,620
it is.
And as I'm looking around it like soaked

1331
00:55:24,621 --> 00:55:29,621
for a second in me that I was like,
this is so a hit like historic in nature

1332
00:55:29,901 --> 00:55:32,750
of like people gathering to watch people
fight.

1333
00:55:32,780 --> 00:55:37,780
It was so like,
it brought me to this weird place of 

1334
00:55:37,780 --> 00:55:40,961
like,
isn't this insane to think that all 

1335
00:55:40,961 --> 00:55:43,260
these humans are just coming to watch 
these two athletes just grapple at one 

1336
00:55:43,260 --> 00:55:43,520
another?
It was just,

1337
00:55:43,790 --> 00:55:45,530
it was interesting because the other 
sporting events don't,

1338
00:55:45,531 --> 00:55:46,730
don't hit,
didn't hit me like that.

1339
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:49,950
But when remember when you were a kid 
and the kids would decide we're going to

1340
00:55:50,260 --> 00:55:51,750
fight,
one wants to watch.

1341
00:55:52,220 --> 00:55:53,720
Fuck.
Everybody gathered around.

1342
00:55:53,780 --> 00:55:58,780
Yeah.
It was way more exciting than what was 

1343
00:55:58,780 --> 00:55:58,780
going on in the stupid classrooms.
There was,

1344
00:55:58,780 --> 00:55:58,990
there was little,
there was a little area in,

1345
00:55:59,030 --> 00:56:01,400
in my high school that people fought at 
this like little secret guard.

1346
00:56:01,401 --> 00:56:02,600
It was like a place that you could get 
to,

1347
00:56:02,830 --> 00:56:04,490
you know what I mean?
And people love.

1348
00:56:04,491 --> 00:56:05,410
They do.
They set up fighting.

1349
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:08,700
Two dudes fought over this one girl.
They were both fucking and,

1350
00:56:08,910 --> 00:56:10,280
and she was there.
That was,

1351
00:56:10,460 --> 00:56:15,460
that was even more fucking brutal.
The the kid that they thought was going 

1352
00:56:15,460 --> 00:56:15,590
to win,
he was.

1353
00:56:15,591 --> 00:56:17,360
He was.
I mean he was just a tough kid,

1354
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:18,380
but he had.
He had,

1355
00:56:18,410 --> 00:56:19,370
it was the middle of winter.
I'll,

1356
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:22,190
I'll never forget,
and he had really bad acne and the other

1357
00:56:22,191 --> 00:56:24,040
kid,
every time landed a punch.

1358
00:56:24,220 --> 00:56:26,680
You would see the redness get worse in 
his acne,

1359
00:56:26,681 --> 00:56:28,450
in the blood start coming out of his 
face,

1360
00:56:28,950 --> 00:56:31,810
zit blood as rough as it was,
the fight.

1361
00:56:31,811 --> 00:56:36,811
It was zip blood.
One blood,

1362
00:56:37,290 --> 00:56:39,790
one fighting over a girl.
Not only do you lose the girl,

1363
00:56:39,791 --> 00:56:41,620
but you also get your ass kicked.
He was,

1364
00:56:41,621 --> 00:56:46,621
and she was there,
which was even more fucking brash 

1365
00:56:46,621 --> 00:56:46,621
occurred.
That's how girls are such assholes.

1366
00:56:46,621 --> 00:56:47,950
She stood there and watched these two 
dickheads fight over her shit.

1367
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:49,720
Did she say,
don't stop.

1368
00:56:50,530 --> 00:56:52,210
Cut it out guys,
please.

1369
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:53,020
Now she.
No,

1370
00:56:53,021 --> 00:56:58,021
she didn't say shit.
She said and she knows she did the 

1371
00:56:58,990 --> 00:57:00,680
triangle.
Yeah,

1372
00:57:02,410 --> 00:57:07,410
she watched them do it and the whole 
fucking school watching and then 

1373
00:57:07,410 --> 00:57:07,510
somebody would probably wasn't that 
fight,

1374
00:57:07,511 --> 00:57:10,000
but one fight.
I remember somebody taped and tapes were

1375
00:57:10,001 --> 00:57:11,590
getting passed around.
Oh Jesus.

1376
00:57:11,620 --> 00:57:13,390
But this is what's fucked about school.

1377
00:57:13,420 --> 00:57:17,260
The school rule things like athletes,
we always had this uh,

1378
00:57:17,470 --> 00:57:22,470
guilty by association shit,
if you're there you get suspended even 

1379
00:57:22,470 --> 00:57:23,590
if you had nothing to do with it because
athlete code of conduct.

1380
00:57:24,010 --> 00:57:25,220
Wait a minute.
So,

1381
00:57:25,230 --> 00:57:30,230
so,
so if I'm at a party and it gets busted 

1382
00:57:30,230 --> 00:57:30,230
up by the cops and I don't have alcohol 
or drugs on me or nothing,

1383
00:57:30,310 --> 00:57:35,310
but I'm at that party and it gets back 
to the school and the coaches I get 

1384
00:57:35,310 --> 00:57:35,380
suspended from whatever.
Oh.

1385
00:57:35,381 --> 00:57:36,820
Speaking of which,
Bursa me.

1386
00:57:36,821 --> 00:57:39,970
This one,
there's a code of conduct at Netflix.

1387
00:57:41,110 --> 00:57:42,940
Yeah.
In like an internal thing.

1388
00:57:42,941 --> 00:57:45,100
I'm sorry,
just for laughs rather.

1389
00:57:45,190 --> 00:57:46,120
Oh Shit.
Yeah.

1390
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:49,630
Just for.
I'm going to send you this young Jamie a

1391
00:57:49,780 --> 00:57:54,190
Netflix has a or why don't we keep 
saying Netflix just laughs Montreal.

1392
00:57:54,370 --> 00:57:59,370
Yeah.
Has a code of conduct that they posted 

1393
00:57:59,370 --> 00:57:59,370
everywhere,
I'm sure.

1394
00:57:59,370 --> 00:57:59,370
Oh yeah,
yeah,

1395
00:57:59,590 --> 00:58:00,130
of course.
Yeah.

1396
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:01,150
Yeah.
Hold on one second.

1397
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:04,510
For artists or for people.
It's got to be for artists,

1398
00:58:04,750 --> 00:58:08,990
for the comics here.
That's so jamie.

1399
00:58:09,580 --> 00:58:11,170
Yeah,
a code of conduct,

1400
00:58:11,171 --> 00:58:14,320
how to behave for comic,
for adults grown people.

1401
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:18,700
Listen,
you sell what fucked up people make?

1402
00:58:18,860 --> 00:58:19,340
Yep.
Okay.

1403
00:58:19,390 --> 00:58:20,140
Yep.
Okay.

1404
00:58:20,170 --> 00:58:22,420
But we're going to take it as a code.
Oh Shit.

1405
00:58:22,450 --> 00:58:25,780
Can you make that bigger?
In order to accomplish our purpose?

1406
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:29,260
The just for laughs festival must be 
exempt of abuse.

1407
00:58:29,530 --> 00:58:33,430
Inappropriate or vexatious.
I've never read that before.

1408
00:58:33,431 --> 00:58:35,600
Have you ever heard that word before?
To Vex two VEC,

1409
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:40,640
somebody vexatious behaviors.
Everyone participating in the just for 

1410
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:45,301
laughs festival must treat artists,
festival goers and employees with 

1411
00:58:45,301 --> 00:58:47,410
equality,
respect and dignity.

1412
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:50,140
No matter the gender,
sexual identity,

1413
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:52,780
sexual orientation,
disability,

1414
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:56,440
physical appearance,
race or religion.

1415
00:58:56,470 --> 00:58:57,540
I hope they love it.
About out.

1416
00:58:58,090 --> 00:59:00,040
Yeah.
What about cognitive function?

1417
00:59:00,190 --> 00:59:05,190
Right?
It sounds like you can pick on really 

1418
00:59:05,190 --> 00:59:07,231
stupid people.
Still JFL adopt a zero tolerance policy 

1419
00:59:07,811 --> 00:59:12,730
on harassment in all its forms.
Whether it is verbal comments,

1420
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:15,250
actions,
or gestures that are repeated,

1421
00:59:15,340 --> 00:59:16,810
hostile,
that,

1422
00:59:16,811 --> 00:59:21,811
uh,
affect a person's dignity or 

1423
00:59:21,811 --> 00:59:22,100
psychological or physical.
Oh,

1424
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:24,760
so you can't talk shit anymore.
That's what we do.

1425
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:26,030
What we,
what do we do?

1426
00:59:26,031 --> 00:59:27,560
And we're hanging around.
Fuck Shit.

1427
00:59:27,650 --> 00:59:29,690
That's the whole thing.
You've been harassing me.

1428
00:59:29,691 --> 00:59:31,190
You've been vexatious with me,
sir.

1429
00:59:32,690 --> 00:59:37,690
Nothing in this policy should be 
interpreted as a barrier to artistic 

1430
00:59:37,690 --> 00:59:40,310
freedom too late,
less heroin days.

1431
00:59:40,510 --> 00:59:45,510
They got,
they had to put a French word and that 

1432
00:59:45,510 --> 00:59:45,890
motherfucker.
Discussion teams and security squads,

1433
00:59:45,950 --> 00:59:46,970
what?
Hold on.

1434
00:59:47,150 --> 00:59:52,150
Intervention teams and security squads 
of specialized responders with the 

1435
00:59:52,150 --> 00:59:57,101
mission of increasing the safety of 
women and vulnerable persons during the 

1436
00:59:57,101 --> 01:00:01,781
outdoor events will be on street 
festival site every day between seven 

1437
01:00:01,781 --> 01:00:03,680
and 11,
so if you want to molest,

1438
01:00:03,950 --> 01:00:08,950
here's your hours after 11 up to seven,
they'll be wearing pink armbands and 

1439
01:00:11,841 --> 01:00:15,410
luminous bracelets for v.
better visibility in the dark.

1440
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:20,800
They will also have a tent located on a 
plus last bottom between bone mode,

1441
01:00:25,110 --> 01:00:26,960
bumble news,
God French's.

1442
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:28,040
Awesome.
What were the streets?

1443
01:00:28,041 --> 01:00:29,090
We were.
What were the streets?

1444
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:32,120
They're trying to remember if we can,
we can molest on these streets boys,

1445
01:00:32,121 --> 01:00:34,720
so it's branch out.
We're going to go into the forest lesson

1446
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:36,530
on a road safety.
Catherine,

1447
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:39,260
in addition,
if you are the victim of a witness,

1448
01:00:39,261 --> 01:00:40,700
a prohibited act.
Okay,

1449
01:00:41,030 --> 01:00:42,320
well,
it's a prohibited act.

1450
01:00:42,890 --> 01:00:44,930
Anything listed above.
It seems like everything.

1451
01:00:44,980 --> 01:00:46,180
Yeah,
it is zero conduct.

1452
01:00:46,350 --> 01:00:49,550
I mean them for no rape,
no touching,

1453
01:00:49,551 --> 01:00:54,551
no harassment model of that,
but it seems like they're just covering 

1454
01:00:54,551 --> 01:00:54,980
their ass.
Let's go back up to that.

1455
01:00:55,010 --> 01:00:56,150
What you can't do.
Again,

1456
01:00:56,990 --> 01:00:59,780
I want to know what vexatious is.
What's vexations?

1457
01:00:59,810 --> 01:01:01,340
Inappropriate,
abusive,

1458
01:01:01,580 --> 01:01:06,580
inappropriate or vexatious behaved.
That everything we do is inappropriate.

1459
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:07,660
Yeah.
Okay.

1460
01:01:07,870 --> 01:01:10,040
The idea of what we do for a living is 
inappropriate.

1461
01:01:10,041 --> 01:01:13,160
That whole back alley where everybody 
goes and smokes.

1462
01:01:13,210 --> 01:01:13,420
Yes.

1463
01:01:13,420 --> 01:01:15,650
An inappropriate zone.
Every single time.

1464
01:01:15,651 --> 01:01:16,850
It's.
Every time you go back there,

1465
01:01:16,851 --> 01:01:20,090
people would just say an annoyance,
frustration or worry,

1466
01:01:20,290 --> 01:01:21,900
Huh?
Wow.

1467
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:25,550
Wow.
Who was the thesaurus holder that pulled

1468
01:01:25,551 --> 01:01:28,210
that fuck that bad boy out.
Have you heard that word before?

1469
01:01:28,230 --> 01:01:29,300
No,
never heard that.

1470
01:01:29,370 --> 01:01:31,340
We're covering up their.
Their shit.

1471
01:01:31,430 --> 01:01:36,430
This is them being so overly cautious 
because whatever insurance they've got 

1472
01:01:36,430 --> 01:01:40,001
on fucking whatever is like,
you have to give fair warning that we 

1473
01:01:40,001 --> 01:01:40,250
have security for this,
this and this.

1474
01:01:40,730 --> 01:01:45,730
What's amazing is think about how long 
it's been going on where they didn't 

1475
01:01:45,730 --> 01:01:47,060
have that.
Yeah.

1476
01:01:47,450 --> 01:01:49,790
I was in just for laughs in [inaudible] 
93.

1477
01:01:49,940 --> 01:01:54,940
That your first.
What was your first year and just for 

1478
01:01:54,940 --> 01:01:54,940
JFL?
Nineteen 93 was your first year?

1479
01:01:54,940 --> 01:01:54,940
Yeah,
93.

1480
01:01:54,940 --> 01:01:56,630
Yeah.
So how the fuck?

1481
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:59,000
Ninety three,
but they're pulling this out now.

1482
01:01:59,210 --> 01:02:00,320
That's crazy.
Yeah,

1483
01:02:00,321 --> 01:02:05,321
it's been around for forever,
but I also love that it said on it that 

1484
01:02:05,321 --> 01:02:07,150
you shouldn't.
You have to immediately email you.

1485
01:02:07,160 --> 01:02:09,290
Imagine and we'll get back to you.
You get molested,

1486
01:02:09,291 --> 01:02:11,900
you go to email.
Your Pussy still hurts.

1487
01:02:11,930 --> 01:02:13,970
Someone grabbing it.
You fucking assholes.

1488
01:02:14,210 --> 01:02:15,870
I got email now.
You know what?

1489
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:17,870
I'm going to fucking send this in.
Yeah.

1490
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:20,100
You got an ice zero tolerance

1491
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:24,930
at A.
Hey,

1492
01:02:24,931 --> 01:02:28,140
if you get physically abused,
the email you have to email is.

1493
01:02:28,210 --> 01:02:33,210
Ha Ha.
You probably shouldn't put that email 

1494
01:02:33,210 --> 01:02:33,210
online.
Gone.

1495
01:02:33,210 --> 01:02:34,200
Sorry.
Listen,

1496
01:02:34,330 --> 01:02:34,720
what do you mean?
That's,

1497
01:02:35,220 --> 01:02:36,420
that's public.
That's public.

1498
01:02:37,330 --> 01:02:39,180
Don't get us wrong,
but this is really public.

1499
01:02:39,260 --> 01:02:39,690
No.
Well,

1500
01:02:39,691 --> 01:02:42,020
you know,
you get what you get with it.

1501
01:02:42,030 --> 01:02:43,010
Yes,
but I mean,

1502
01:02:43,080 --> 01:02:46,980
look,
we're not pro harassment,

1503
01:02:47,070 --> 01:02:52,070
don't get us wrong,
but this just seems like a little over 

1504
01:02:52,070 --> 01:02:52,070
the top.
But see this,

1505
01:02:52,070 --> 01:02:55,380
this in some semblance of irony.
This is harassing.

1506
01:02:56,040 --> 01:02:58,200
It's just like poking the bear at people
to be like,

1507
01:02:58,710 --> 01:03:03,710
these are all the things you can't do.
All it's doing is like steering people 

1508
01:03:03,710 --> 01:03:06,531
to go.
I wasn't going to do any of that shit 

1509
01:03:06,531 --> 01:03:06,531
anyway.
Why are you fucking.

1510
01:03:06,531 --> 01:03:08,990
Why are you,
why are you employing people to walk 

1511
01:03:08,990 --> 01:03:11,121
around and armbands to,
to make sure I'm not doing a thing that 

1512
01:03:11,121 --> 01:03:11,121
I was never going to do?

1513
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:12,360
Well,
was it an issue?

1514
01:03:12,420 --> 01:03:14,970
If it was a huge issue than that,
then I'd like to know.

1515
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:18,990
Well drunk him comedians can be gross,
so drunk and are pieces of shit.

1516
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:24,320
But you've created a festival where 
there's drunken animals walking the 

1517
01:03:24,320 --> 01:03:24,320
streets all night long.
Right?

1518
01:03:24,320 --> 01:03:28,760
So w w,
I mean you need a shirt that says 

1519
01:03:28,760 --> 01:03:30,210
vexatious vexatious fixation vex me 
baby.

1520
01:03:30,530 --> 01:03:34,090
If exit up,
going it up and it up.

1521
01:03:34,620 --> 01:03:38,300
I've been vexing all over him.
All vexatious over here.

1522
01:03:38,900 --> 01:03:43,900
I'm all inappropriate stuff being 
vexatious inappropriate to weird word 

1523
01:03:43,900 --> 01:03:44,700
too,
because by WHO's definitions?

1524
01:03:45,210 --> 01:03:47,850
But all that stuff is all subjective.
Who standards of anything.

1525
01:03:47,940 --> 01:03:52,320
It's to vex main means to annoy or to 
like poke and prod annoyances.

1526
01:03:52,370 --> 01:03:54,320
Such a commonality in our fucking daily 
life.

1527
01:03:54,350 --> 01:03:55,560
Yeah.
I'm annoyed by that comment.

1528
01:03:55,620 --> 01:03:56,550
Yeah.
That's vexed.

1529
01:03:57,270 --> 01:04:00,270
Vexed by the vexatious fucking the 
signed document.

1530
01:04:01,470 --> 01:04:02,890
But what burst that all over?

1531
01:04:03,950 --> 01:04:05,600
He said it to me today.
Yeah,

1532
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:10,640
I'm sure.
I'm sure they posted them all over and 

1533
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:10,640
people walking around trying to protect 
people who.

1534
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:12,210
What is that about?
It's weird.

1535
01:04:12,211 --> 01:04:17,211
It's like you want.
You need fucked up people to make rock 

1536
01:04:17,211 --> 01:04:19,910
and roll and comedy and rap music.
Yep.

1537
01:04:20,020 --> 01:04:22,860
Like you need it,
but in this day and age,

1538
01:04:22,890 --> 01:04:25,860
nobody.
Everybody wants no one to be fucked up.

1539
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:31,280
I think when people love,
when people like reminisce about a time 

1540
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:33,130
when a amazing artist who was a Weirdo,
they do that because they don't.

1541
01:04:33,180 --> 01:04:34,830
They didn't realize what also came along
with it.

1542
01:04:35,070 --> 01:04:37,170
You know,
like they're like fucking,

1543
01:04:37,610 --> 01:04:39,870
you know,
whatever.

1544
01:04:39,900 --> 01:04:41,280
An amazing musician.
They were like,

1545
01:04:41,310 --> 01:04:42,780
they were totally fucked up.
They did crazy,

1546
01:04:42,781 --> 01:04:45,210
fucked up shit all the time.
It's like they couldn't do that today.

1547
01:04:46,110 --> 01:04:51,110
Yeah.
You mentioned Jim Morrison fucked be 

1548
01:04:51,110 --> 01:04:51,110
fine.
You'd be fucked.

1549
01:04:51,110 --> 01:04:51,470
He couldn't do any of the things he did.
Fuck.

1550
01:04:51,540 --> 01:04:56,540
They fucked.
I mean that guy used to pull his dick 

1551
01:04:56,540 --> 01:04:56,540
out on stage.
All the tested for it.

1552
01:04:56,540 --> 01:04:56,540
Piss on.
She piss on people.

1553
01:04:57,360 --> 01:05:00,960
He pull out his dick and piss on someone
and people think that like tea today.

1554
01:05:00,961 --> 01:05:02,520
It'd be.
That'd be the end of times for him.

1555
01:05:03,090 --> 01:05:04,260
The end.
That's all.

1556
01:05:04,620 --> 01:05:06,180
I want to kill you.

1557
01:05:08,940 --> 01:05:12,120
Pissing off people on the front row.
But that's the thing.

1558
01:05:12,121 --> 01:05:12,650
It's like,
that's,

1559
01:05:13,610 --> 01:05:18,610
that's,
that's the whole irony of this whole 

1560
01:05:18,610 --> 01:05:21,321
performers getting unbridled.
I had a buddy of mine who loved music 

1561
01:05:21,910 --> 01:05:25,000
who's really into like old bands but did
not like Jim Morrison.

1562
01:05:25,001 --> 01:05:25,960
He's like,
please anything,

1563
01:05:25,970 --> 01:05:28,720
but why did he not like the doors?
Because he was a good looking guy.

1564
01:05:28,721 --> 01:05:31,150
I've got tons of pussy.
It bothered him.

1565
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:33,370
I guarantee you that was part of it.
I'm like,

1566
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:38,400
wait a minute.
You don't think that Jim Morrison and 

1567
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:40,480
the doors were good music?
You don't think that break on through to

1568
01:05:40,481 --> 01:05:42,610
the other side is a good song.
Yeah.

1569
01:05:42,611 --> 01:05:45,910
What do you look me in the eyes?
You tell me.

1570
01:05:46,180 --> 01:05:51,180
Break on through to the other side isn't
a fucking amazing song and it was in 

1571
01:05:51,180 --> 01:05:53,020
1968 or some shit.
Yeah.

1572
01:05:53,530 --> 01:05:55,180
Fuck you man.
And he's like,

1573
01:05:55,181 --> 01:05:56,710
that's just not.
It's not good music,

1574
01:05:56,711 --> 01:05:57,460
man.
Yeah.

1575
01:05:57,461 --> 01:06:02,461
I'm fucking Jim Morrison and the doors 
locked because he just slinging dick 

1576
01:06:02,461 --> 01:06:04,000
half out of it.
It's so hot.

1577
01:06:04,120 --> 01:06:05,140
So hot,
so high.

1578
01:06:05,141 --> 01:06:06,850
So gone.
No shirt on.

1579
01:06:06,851 --> 01:06:11,851
Still making phenomenal fucking music 
lunch out on like a scarecrow beads 

1580
01:06:14,280 --> 01:06:15,100
everywhere.
Certified.

1581
01:06:15,140 --> 01:06:20,070
Get this cocksucker candles,
riders on the storm.

1582
01:06:23,500 --> 01:06:28,500
He made that intro so long so he could 
finish when he was getting blown up to 

1583
01:06:28,500 --> 01:06:31,561
this house.
Come on,

1584
01:06:33,281 --> 01:06:38,281
man.
Break on through to the other side of 

1585
01:06:38,281 --> 01:06:38,281
the fucking amazing.
So good.

1586
01:06:38,281 --> 01:06:39,220
He had.
They had so many amazing songs,

1587
01:06:39,880 --> 01:06:42,250
but that era of music had so much good 
music.

1588
01:06:42,280 --> 01:06:44,980
I think it was also another part of the 
problem was when Val kilmer played them,

1589
01:06:45,730 --> 01:06:46,990
that was a big fucking issue.
I mean,

1590
01:06:46,991 --> 01:06:48,130
yeah,
that was a big bummer for me.

1591
01:06:48,131 --> 01:06:50,200
I'll kilmer who is a beautiful man at 
the time.

1592
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:54,610
He added all the beautiful men who are 
not beautiful men who fell so far.

1593
01:06:54,670 --> 01:06:55,920
Woo,
what happened?

1594
01:06:55,960 --> 01:07:00,960
Val?
Val just got into cake and heroin looks 

1595
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:02,710
like pull up a picture,
but it makes me sad every time I see it.

1596
01:07:02,711 --> 01:07:04,900
Like I'm like,
that guy was fucking bat.

1597
01:07:04,940 --> 01:07:07,790
He was a batman.
He was one of the best path man.

1598
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:10,990
And now you're like,
what did he do?

1599
01:07:10,991 --> 01:07:15,020
Did you just start drinking booze?
I don't quite remember what I remember.

1600
01:07:15,021 --> 01:07:17,290
There was rumors about he had,
he was like covering up papers,

1601
01:07:17,291 --> 01:07:18,760
really sick.
He had cancer,

1602
01:07:18,761 --> 01:07:23,761
right?
But then he denies it doesn't even deny 

1603
01:07:23,761 --> 01:07:23,761
it.
I thought he denied it for years.

1604
01:07:23,761 --> 01:07:25,330
I thought it was like a thing where 
people were like,

1605
01:07:26,470 --> 01:07:28,240
he's,
he that he said he was sick,

1606
01:07:28,241 --> 01:07:33,241
but it wasn't cancer that he was like 
val cameras and comeback and the top 

1607
01:07:34,091 --> 01:07:35,650
guns sequel.
Oh.

1608
01:07:35,860 --> 01:07:37,180
So he got throat cancer.
Oh man,

1609
01:07:37,181 --> 01:07:38,350
he's,
he's thin again.

1610
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:39,460
Yeah,
he's looking better there.

1611
01:07:39,580 --> 01:07:41,130
Let me see that.
Don't scrawl.

1612
01:07:42,280 --> 01:07:44,020
Stopped with the flashes.
You assholes.

1613
01:07:44,110 --> 01:07:46,300
Can't even see what it looks like.
That's what it used to look like.

1614
01:07:47,370 --> 01:07:49,840
The actor revealed the news on Reddit 
during an ask me anything.

1615
01:07:49,930 --> 01:07:50,890
Q and a.
Oh,

1616
01:07:50,891 --> 01:07:52,690
how weird.
Red,

1617
01:07:52,691 --> 01:07:53,650
it's so funny,
but that shit,

1618
01:07:53,950 --> 01:07:58,950
one commenter said awhile ago,
Michael Douglas claimed you have 

1619
01:07:58,950 --> 01:07:58,950
terminal cancer.
What was the story behind that?

1620
01:07:59,860 --> 01:08:02,470
And he said,
killer responded.

1621
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:05,530
Okay.
We can read that quicker.

1622
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:08,680
He was probably trying to help me 
because.

1623
01:08:08,890 --> 01:08:10,600
Oh,
what the fuck,

1624
01:08:12,030 --> 01:08:15,980
what the fuck folks,
because the screen got filled

1625
01:08:16,310 --> 01:08:21,310
with all of these popups for possibly 
new videos that you want to watch while 

1626
01:08:21,310 --> 01:08:22,380
you're watching a video.
Uh,

1627
01:08:22,590 --> 01:08:26,300
I did have a healing of cancer,
but my tongue is still swollen,

1628
01:08:26,360 --> 01:08:31,360
although healing all the time because I 
don't sound my normal self yet.

1629
01:08:31,970 --> 01:08:34,010
People think I may still be under the 
weather.

1630
01:08:35,410 --> 01:08:37,910
I like to refer to cancer as under the 
weather.

1631
01:08:38,360 --> 01:08:40,070
That's a fucking,
that's a pretty bold leap.

1632
01:08:40,750 --> 01:08:42,100
But when he got really fat,
but it's,

1633
01:08:42,101 --> 01:08:43,840
that's one of the reasons why I got 
cancer,

1634
01:08:43,860 --> 01:08:48,770
but he was really unhealthy because I 
think it wasn't just see what.

1635
01:08:48,830 --> 01:08:50,840
I don't think it was just that he got 
cancer.

1636
01:08:50,841 --> 01:08:55,820
I think he also was like really fucked 
up for awhile health wise in terms of he

1637
01:08:55,821 --> 01:08:57,980
just looked so different.
Bu's and chant.

1638
01:08:58,190 --> 01:09:01,040
Yeah.
Two Thousand 15.

1639
01:09:01,050 --> 01:09:02,720
He was rushed to the hospital.
Yeah,

1640
01:09:02,840 --> 01:09:06,410
but this is before that,
but see before 2015,

1641
01:09:06,411 --> 01:09:07,580
he looks so strange there.

1642
01:09:07,580 --> 01:09:09,860
That doesn't look like the same guy.
Well,

1643
01:09:09,861 --> 01:09:14,861
it looks like he's got a Bandana.
It looks and it looks like he's got to 

1644
01:09:14,861 --> 01:09:16,800
look at his left eye,
but that's what.

1645
01:09:16,910 --> 01:09:17,870
What,
what does that say?

1646
01:09:18,020 --> 01:09:23,020
Scroll up to what is his left eye 
looking at and as you're looking at 

1647
01:09:23,020 --> 01:09:23,020
someone choose.
Someone's got a nice tip.

1648
01:09:23,020 --> 01:09:26,100
Someone's got great shoes.
Looking at one ticket.

1649
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:27,660
Left it.
Geez,

1650
01:09:29,090 --> 01:09:31,490
I'd love just that left head.
Left to the juicy.

1651
01:09:31,860 --> 01:09:34,750
I'm running errands and London without 
his trick.

1652
01:09:34,820 --> 01:09:36,050
A tracheotomy.
Trey.

1653
01:09:36,230 --> 01:09:37,040
Trey,
how do you say that?

1654
01:09:37,041 --> 01:09:38,870
Tracheotomy.
Craig asked me to.

1655
01:09:39,350 --> 01:09:40,130
Oh,
so he did.

1656
01:09:40,131 --> 01:09:41,270
He had a whole.
Yeah,

1657
01:09:41,271 --> 01:09:43,860
that's why he's it out.
Wow.

1658
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:45,440
But see,
that's what I mean when they say rumors.

1659
01:09:45,441 --> 01:09:50,441
Right.
I do remember that he had denied it 

1660
01:09:50,441 --> 01:09:50,441
heavily that he had cancer.
It was like a whole 2013.

1661
01:09:50,860 --> 01:09:54,590
Oh,
Michael Douglas for oral cancer.

1662
01:09:54,700 --> 01:09:55,790
Woo.
Fuck me.

1663
01:09:56,240 --> 01:10:01,240
I could douglas do them now.
It wasn't that whole thing about him 

1664
01:10:01,240 --> 01:10:01,240
saying that he went down on his,
on his wife too much,

1665
01:10:01,240 --> 01:10:02,600
wasn't it like a big thing that he was 
like,

1666
01:10:03,340 --> 01:10:08,340
he said that there was a rumor that he 
said find out what the story about that 

1667
01:10:09,441 --> 01:10:14,441
is.
We should probably should clarify 

1668
01:10:14,441 --> 01:10:14,441
because I want to know what she got 
really mad at that apparently.

1669
01:10:14,441 --> 01:10:14,441
I mean,
yeah,

1670
01:10:14,441 --> 01:10:15,470
because she's like,
I don't got cancer pussy.

1671
01:10:15,810 --> 01:10:18,260
Imagine your wise pussies.
So funky.

1672
01:10:18,380 --> 01:10:21,260
But people do get a lot of cancer from 
throat cancer,

1673
01:10:21,261 --> 01:10:22,940
from HPV apparently.
Well,

1674
01:10:22,941 --> 01:10:24,060
that's real shit.
Yeah.

1675
01:10:24,100 --> 01:10:25,080
That's really from Lincoln.

1676
01:10:32,160 --> 01:10:32,780
Even,
uh,

1677
01:10:32,790 --> 01:10:37,790
even,
even a lot of pussy venereal diseases 

1678
01:10:37,790 --> 01:10:38,540
are so weird because diseases that 
specifically come from sex.

1679
01:10:38,690 --> 01:10:39,920
Michael Douglas.
Sorry,

1680
01:10:39,921 --> 01:10:43,490
I was sorry for the effect of oral sex 
cancer comments on my wife.

1681
01:10:44,300 --> 01:10:46,520
Okay.
What did he say though?

1682
01:10:47,270 --> 01:10:52,270
Inside regretted the embarrassment 
caused to his wife Catherine Zeta Jones 

1683
01:10:52,270 --> 01:10:56,441
by the revelation two years ago that has
cancer may have been caused by 

1684
01:10:56,441 --> 01:10:57,290
performing oral sex.
Probably just joking.

1685
01:10:57,620 --> 01:11:02,620
No,
I don't think it was that his illness 

1686
01:11:02,620 --> 01:11:03,560
was a result of contracting the human 
papilloma virus,

1687
01:11:03,561 --> 01:11:08,450
which experts believe can be brought on 
by Cunnilingus.

1688
01:11:08,451 --> 01:11:13,451
I love that word.
The store made headlines around the 

1689
01:11:13,451 --> 01:11:16,601
world when Douglas was promoting his 
emmy winning role in liberace bio pic 

1690
01:11:17,011 --> 01:11:20,610
behind the candelabra after being 
declared free of cancer.

1691
01:11:20,910 --> 01:11:22,500
By the way,
did you ever see that movie,

1692
01:11:23,230 --> 01:11:28,230
Diaz and a fucking bit on that.
That unfortunately has been lost because

1693
01:11:28,471 --> 01:11:32,490
Joey Diaz has never really done a 
special other than he didn't one special

1694
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:37,010
couple of years back,
but you to do a special on Joey Diaz,

1695
01:11:37,020 --> 01:11:42,020
what you really do need to have joey do 
like five nights in a row and just turn 

1696
01:11:42,020 --> 01:11:46,971
the cameras on every night and just let 
them go loose and then fill it all and 

1697
01:11:46,971 --> 01:11:48,200
then eventually you'll get that Joey 
Diaz mom 100 percent.

1698
01:11:48,200 --> 01:11:50,040
Get that experience.
But when you say,

1699
01:11:50,041 --> 01:11:50,760
okay,
Joey,

1700
01:11:50,850 --> 01:11:54,210
be yourself now,
get on camera and guys clap it in.

1701
01:11:54,280 --> 01:11:59,280
It's just hard for a guy who's that wild
and loose to be wild and loose on demand

1702
01:12:00,270 --> 01:12:03,810
with a bunch of lighting on and they 
want to put makeup on him and everything

1703
01:12:03,811 --> 01:12:06,960
becomes artificial and it ruins the vibe
of what standup is.

1704
01:12:07,080 --> 01:12:09,390
One hundred percent.
So unfortunately,

1705
01:12:09,660 --> 01:12:11,700
you know joey being the wild man that 
is.

1706
01:12:11,701 --> 01:12:15,480
He's never a lot of his greatest bits 
are never been captured,

1707
01:12:15,570 --> 01:12:19,470
but he had a Michael Douglas doing 
liberace bit.

1708
01:12:19,500 --> 01:12:24,500
That was so good.
It was so good because if you're 

1709
01:12:24,500 --> 01:12:25,200
watching that documentary,
I watched it yet.

1710
01:12:25,210 --> 01:12:27,510
We're not documentary movie drama.
What is it?

1711
01:12:28,300 --> 01:12:29,720
Bio Pick.
What would you call it?

1712
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:31,440
Bio Pic.
Yeah.

1713
01:12:31,830 --> 01:12:33,110
It's so good.
Yeah,

1714
01:12:33,111 --> 01:12:34,500
it's phenomenal.
You realize like,

1715
01:12:34,501 --> 01:12:35,310
wow,
crazy.

1716
01:12:35,311 --> 01:12:40,311
Liberace was.
He ended up like a pump for his dick 

1717
01:12:40,311 --> 01:12:40,311
couldn't get hard anymore.

1718
01:12:40,311 --> 01:12:44,690
She had like a little Dick was just 
always ready to rock and he's just 

1719
01:12:45,510 --> 01:12:46,890
banging his boy and his boyfriend was 
like,

1720
01:12:46,891 --> 01:12:48,020
what is going on?
Like,

1721
01:12:48,150 --> 01:12:49,590
why don't you ever get solved?
He's like,

1722
01:12:49,660 --> 01:12:50,440
no,
no,

1723
01:12:51,080 --> 01:12:56,080
no,
ain't no fucking explained to Canada 

1724
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:56,910
with his Dick thing,
thing,

1725
01:12:56,980 --> 01:12:57,370
thing,
thing,

1726
01:12:57,371 --> 01:12:58,200
thing,
thing.

1727
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:03,800
And you know,
he would always do this thing where 

1728
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:03,800
ladies would be like liberace.
When are you gonna?

1729
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:08,570
Find a woman soon date that was really 
famous that they cut,

1730
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:11,580
that he dated someone super,
super famous.

1731
01:13:12,210 --> 01:13:13,720
Liberace.
And who he dated.

1732
01:13:13,730 --> 01:13:16,380
Like a really famous actress.
There's a great song.

1733
01:13:16,440 --> 01:13:19,410
Pull.
Pull up the video for the song.

1734
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:22,980
When liberace winks at me.
It is.

1735
01:13:24,370 --> 01:13:27,160
What will we get kicked off youtube for 
that one trouble before?

1736
01:13:27,161 --> 01:13:27,730
Yeah.
Yeah.

1737
01:13:27,910 --> 01:13:31,060
Can we play it?
And so we can hear it with the people at

1738
01:13:31,061 --> 01:13:33,820
home can't.
Unfortunately.

1739
01:13:33,821 --> 01:13:36,420
Folks that you can look it up yourself.
Well we can play.

1740
01:13:36,610 --> 01:13:39,070
Would that,
would the people on Youtube and not hear

1741
01:13:39,071 --> 01:13:39,910
it?
That's the problem yet.

1742
01:13:39,930 --> 01:13:41,350
But Youtube,
itunes would hear it,

1743
01:13:41,351 --> 01:13:44,650
right?
Or RSS feeds if you're android.

1744
01:13:44,830 --> 01:13:46,960
Do you know this more android phones.
There are phones.

1745
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:49,210
Yeah.
Good fucking iphone.

1746
01:13:49,211 --> 01:13:49,930
Shit.
So annoying.

1747
01:13:49,931 --> 01:13:51,390
Now it's annoying.
I'm getting second.

1748
01:13:51,400 --> 01:13:52,380
We're going Andrew.
One too,

1749
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:53,500
man.
I'm tired of the bullshit.

1750
01:13:53,980 --> 01:13:55,180
Let's do it.
Let's go together.

1751
01:13:55,210 --> 01:13:58,030
Let's go.
Every listener switch.

1752
01:13:58,060 --> 01:13:59,590
Switch switches me.
Crazy.

1753
01:13:59,620 --> 01:14:00,920
Here it is.
Let's listen to this song.

1754
01:14:00,921 --> 01:14:02,770
So it's peggy king.

1755
01:14:11,070 --> 01:14:15,270
I found a brand new idol.
He's charming as can be.

1756
01:14:15,590 --> 01:14:19,110
This is a different world,
a different world back then,

1757
01:14:19,111 --> 01:14:20,590
man.
Oh,

1758
01:14:20,610 --> 01:14:22,950
get liberace.
Hi.

1759
01:14:22,951 --> 01:14:25,880
Like sucking Dick guy like that.
I like to again,

1760
01:14:25,890 --> 01:14:29,490
my bud.
Uh,

1761
01:14:29,491 --> 01:14:34,491
I started to shake.
I started to shiver and every fiber in 

1762
01:14:34,491 --> 01:14:37,090
my being begins to quiver and she's 
smoking,

1763
01:14:37,380 --> 01:14:37,740
right?
Yeah.

1764
01:14:37,750 --> 01:14:38,650
Yeah.
Actually writing.

1765
01:14:38,690 --> 01:14:43,690
I don't know.
It's a pencil when liberace winks and 

1766
01:14:44,300 --> 01:14:46,160
queuing sent me.
You hear the clink.

1767
01:14:46,161 --> 01:14:47,300
When he winks clink,

1768
01:14:49,650 --> 01:14:52,030
I just tell people to go to it.
Go to go to youtube.

1769
01:14:52,900 --> 01:14:57,390
Google Peggy King.
When liberace winks at me,

1770
01:14:57,900 --> 01:14:59,520
it's a crazy video.
I imagine he would like.

1771
01:14:59,560 --> 01:15:02,680
He would sing that to him while he was 
pumping some dude.

1772
01:15:02,681 --> 01:15:07,681
He was whatever.
Visit boyfriend at that time when they 

1773
01:15:07,681 --> 01:15:07,870
have a.
He winks at me.

1774
01:15:08,070 --> 01:15:09,880
He didn't really.
He Sang,

1775
01:15:09,881 --> 01:15:12,490
but he was more known for playing the 
piano.

1776
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:13,680
But he was a singer too.
Yeah,

1777
01:15:13,720 --> 01:15:14,410
yeah.
Yeah.

1778
01:15:14,411 --> 01:15:15,340
But he was what?
That song.

1779
01:15:15,370 --> 01:15:16,640
He's not saying it at all.
I don't know.

1780
01:15:16,870 --> 01:15:20,140
He's winking when liberace winks at me.
She was a huge star.

1781
01:15:20,530 --> 01:15:22,660
Mass piano players.
Fucking massive.

1782
01:15:22,661 --> 01:15:25,240
Imagine if you were a kid today and 
you're like,

1783
01:15:25,310 --> 01:15:27,850
I'm going to get famous.
Playing the piano was like,

1784
01:15:27,851 --> 01:15:31,150
fuck you and get the fuck out.
Fuck you and fuck Kenny g,

1785
01:15:31,270 --> 01:15:34,430
she's the last.
Who's kidding?

1786
01:15:34,450 --> 01:15:34,610
Geez.

1787
01:15:34,620 --> 01:15:38,110
The last guy to get famous for an 
instructor for one solo into one single.

1788
01:15:38,111 --> 01:15:41,670
Instruments it fuck off.
Well now because now you've got them.

1789
01:15:41,690 --> 01:15:46,690
If you'd like playing the violin,
you got also had like a hip hop beat to 

1790
01:15:46,690 --> 01:15:46,690
it or something like they have to do 
like a layer of something.

1791
01:15:46,690 --> 01:15:47,770
No one does one thing and then that's 
it,

1792
01:15:48,280 --> 01:15:50,500
but it's like,
imagine if you're a kid today and you're

1793
01:15:50,501 --> 01:15:55,501
like,
I'm going to get famous riding the bike 

1794
01:15:55,501 --> 01:15:55,501
like Lance Armstrong,
belkoff no.

1795
01:15:55,501 --> 01:15:55,630
Chunk off.
Get outta here.

1796
01:15:55,690 --> 01:15:59,320
There's no no one now,
no one liberace used.

1797
01:15:59,380 --> 01:16:04,380
Judy Garland's West as Jesus Christ.
Fucking popups today are so annoying.

1798
01:16:05,950 --> 01:16:10,950
Mae West,
Midwest West as least convincing beards 

1799
01:16:10,950 --> 01:16:10,950
ever.
Yeah,

1800
01:16:10,950 --> 01:16:12,040
right there.
If you looked at them,

1801
01:16:12,130 --> 01:16:14,350
they're looking at him right there.
Make that picture bigger.

1802
01:16:14,890 --> 01:16:19,890
He looks so good.
I mean there's just people that look 

1803
01:16:19,890 --> 01:16:21,190
gay.
Well,

1804
01:16:21,640 --> 01:16:22,540
you know,
here's the problem.

1805
01:16:22,570 --> 01:16:24,310
Those other guys would gay to.
Well,

1806
01:16:24,311 --> 01:16:29,230
they're all presented to people just 
look gay or back then he's on her left.

1807
01:16:29,320 --> 01:16:30,440
Yes.
That's him right there.

1808
01:16:30,441 --> 01:16:30,970
Yeah,
right there.

1809
01:16:30,990 --> 01:16:32,560
Let me look at that smile.
That's gay,

1810
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:37,120
but so's the guy on her right eye.
Got Gaze is probably one of his buddies.

1811
01:16:37,170 --> 01:16:38,440
Yeah.
One of his roommates.

1812
01:16:39,160 --> 01:16:39,970
Yeah.
Midwest is like,

1813
01:16:40,030 --> 01:16:42,100
I'm so confused.
Nobody wants to affect me.

1814
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:47,640
It's just been typed in weight so we're 
liberace.

1815
01:16:47,831 --> 01:16:52,831
Had no trouble getting all the dates he 
wanted and he gloried in escorting.

1816
01:16:53,711 --> 01:16:58,711
Well known entertainers to parties.
Getting his picture taken with Susan 

1817
01:16:59,260 --> 01:17:00,760
Hayward Stone.
Rosemary Clooney?

1818
01:17:00,850 --> 01:17:03,250
Yeah.
May West was a pure garland.

1819
01:17:03,580 --> 01:17:08,580
May West was the only one of his so 
called lady friends that I actually met 

1820
01:17:08,650 --> 01:17:09,980
as they say in Texas.

1821
01:17:10,220 --> 01:17:12,740
May was a hoot.
Who wrote this?

1822
01:17:12,770 --> 01:17:14,310
She was a drunk.
Hmm.

1823
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:19,800
This is a gay website because what's up 
with that guy in the lower right hand 

1824
01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:20,570
corner from his boyfriend?
Oh.

1825
01:17:21,050 --> 01:17:23,120
Oh.
The website's called Queer Queer.

1826
01:17:23,150 --> 01:17:25,190
Queer.
That's the name of the website.

1827
01:17:26,750 --> 01:17:31,040
Jamie's this on a favorites.
He's got that Shit bookmarked,

1828
01:17:31,100 --> 01:17:36,100
so we'll get.
Look that fucking Michael Douglas 

1829
01:17:36,100 --> 01:17:36,100
playing them.
Look how good that is.

1830
01:17:36,100 --> 01:17:40,720
Look,
he looked exactly like him behind the 

1831
01:17:40,720 --> 01:17:40,720
candelabra.
Well,

1832
01:17:40,720 --> 01:17:40,720
they'll you that.
Scroll down where they go side by side.

1833
01:17:40,720 --> 01:17:42,950
Look at that one right there in the red 
with the Red Hue.

1834
01:17:42,980 --> 01:17:44,210
Yeah.
Look at that.

1835
01:17:44,570 --> 01:17:49,570
Well,
didn't they put makeup on him and shit 

1836
01:17:49,570 --> 01:17:49,570
and make them look more likely.
I know what it still does.

1837
01:17:49,570 --> 01:17:49,910
Structurally.
Still kind of looks at.

1838
01:17:49,911 --> 01:17:52,270
He has the same kind of close enough.
Yeah.

1839
01:17:52,490 --> 01:17:54,410
But I think they did something with his 
chin.

1840
01:17:54,490 --> 01:17:56,750
Chin.
The lower the upper right hand one.

1841
01:17:56,751 --> 01:17:57,170
Where the,
the,

1842
01:17:57,230 --> 01:17:59,450
the upper right hand.
Upper right hand or lumps.

1843
01:17:59,460 --> 01:18:00,240
Lumpski.
I'm sorry.

1844
01:18:00,290 --> 01:18:02,190
Upper lefthand.
The one with the uh,

1845
01:18:02,220 --> 01:18:06,560
the guy that actually got the work done.
Yeah.

1846
01:18:06,561 --> 01:18:07,370
Look,
he,

1847
01:18:07,700 --> 01:18:12,700
he made him get plate fat.
Facial plastic surgery.

1848
01:18:13,220 --> 01:18:18,220
So he resembled liberace.
So he gets his face looked like 

1849
01:18:18,220 --> 01:18:18,920
liberace.
His boyfriend,

1850
01:18:18,921 --> 01:18:23,921
he wanted him to look like himself.
And he made his boyfriend looked like 

1851
01:18:23,921 --> 01:18:23,921
him.
How crazy is that?

1852
01:18:24,890 --> 01:18:26,870
Yeah.
Because liberace had a wig.

1853
01:18:27,080 --> 01:18:29,660
So.
And part of the movie liberace takes the

1854
01:18:29,661 --> 01:18:32,660
wig off.
Rob Lowe,

1855
01:18:33,410 --> 01:18:36,290
Rob Lowe was amazing in that movie.
That's a great book.

1856
01:18:36,350 --> 01:18:41,350
What years that movie from.
I was just gonna say it's not too long 

1857
01:18:41,350 --> 01:18:41,350
ago,
dude.

1858
01:18:41,350 --> 01:18:44,861
Let me tell you something.
Joey Diaz had one of the best bits of 

1859
01:18:44,861 --> 01:18:44,861
all time about that movie.
I'd like to get jude.

1860
01:18:44,880 --> 01:18:46,910
Joey d is high and make them watch it 
again.

1861
01:18:47,390 --> 01:18:50,490
He should read.
He should read birth.

1862
01:18:50,500 --> 01:18:52,640
That video.
I want to know this bit.

1863
01:18:52,641 --> 01:18:54,830
So fucking it was so committed to beg 
them to do it,

1864
01:18:54,831 --> 01:18:55,700
but he won't do it.
Good.

1865
01:18:56,700 --> 01:19:00,010
Don't do that shit anymore.
The problem is you would have to.

1866
01:19:00,080 --> 01:19:05,080
He would have to want to do it.
You really couldn't talk him into doing 

1867
01:19:05,080 --> 01:19:06,620
it and he would also have to be 
enthusiastic about it again,

1868
01:19:06,770 --> 01:19:09,530
like why he'd want to want.
He'd want to tell a half to want to tell

1869
01:19:09,531 --> 01:19:10,540
the joke.
Yeah.

1870
01:19:10,550 --> 01:19:12,260
What was the whole bit?
So it was.

1871
01:19:12,261 --> 01:19:15,770
The story was he was watching the you 
drama.

1872
01:19:16,610 --> 01:19:19,970
He can't eat pussy with asthma behind 
the candelabra by joy.

1873
01:19:20,470 --> 01:19:21,240
Is this it?
I don't know.

1874
01:19:21,250 --> 01:19:24,050
It's a 10 minute rant about it came from
his podcast.

1875
01:19:24,120 --> 01:19:26,240
Jesus play this.
I didn't even know this existed.

1876
01:19:26,390 --> 01:19:27,870
Look at that.
That should be a shirt.

1877
01:19:29,010 --> 01:19:29,900
What was the last good movie?

1878
01:19:30,150 --> 01:19:33,330
The last good movie I seen the last one.
He was with men on fire that said,

1879
01:19:34,340 --> 01:19:39,340
why don't go to Mexico because Mexico.
Have you made friends with Denzel 

1880
01:19:40,081 --> 01:19:41,550
Washington?
Don't go to Mexico.

1881
01:19:41,551 --> 01:19:45,020
You understand me if you don't about 
watch fucking man on fire.

1882
01:19:45,230 --> 01:19:46,440
Play this.
Who did this?

1883
01:19:46,620 --> 01:19:51,620
And the second best movie.
I've seen this movie on Hbo called 

1884
01:19:51,620 --> 01:19:54,120
behind the Candelabra,
behind the candelabras.

1885
01:19:54,150 --> 01:19:56,670
Liberace scoring.
Some of you guys are very young.

1886
01:19:56,671 --> 01:19:59,160
You don't remember liberace.
There's a lot of people that are long in

1887
01:19:59,161 --> 01:20:00,150
the tooth.
You know what the fuck?

1888
01:20:00,151 --> 01:20:05,151
Liberace.
Liberace was a piano player from the 

1889
01:20:05,151 --> 01:20:06,360
sixties or seventies that was very 
popular.

1890
01:20:06,361 --> 01:20:10,570
He was flaming and he had a fucking wig,
but he,

1891
01:20:10,600 --> 01:20:11,970
he,
he pulled a Michael Jackson.

1892
01:20:11,971 --> 01:20:16,971
He told people he was engaged,
so nobody really believed that he was 

1893
01:20:16,971 --> 01:20:17,040
gay.
I don't give a fuck either way if you're

1894
01:20:17,041 --> 01:20:18,840
gay and that I.
It makes no difference to me.

1895
01:20:19,140 --> 01:20:24,140
He was a good piano player.
They did this movie about them and the 

1896
01:20:24,140 --> 01:20:24,390
funny thing about this movie that he was
played by Gecko,

1897
01:20:24,690 --> 01:20:28,050
Michael Douglas Played Liberace,
so we came home one day and I'm like,

1898
01:20:28,051 --> 01:20:29,310
fuck it,
let's watch this thing.

1899
01:20:29,311 --> 01:20:33,000
Right?
So I'm watching this liberace dude,

1900
01:20:33,001 --> 01:20:35,010
and he's playing the piano and shit and 
whatnot.

1901
01:20:35,250 --> 01:20:36,480
When you watched a movie,
you're like,

1902
01:20:36,510 --> 01:20:38,970
look at this fucking old guy.
He's got game old guys.

1903
01:20:38,971 --> 01:20:42,450
Got Damn okay.
A lot of people don't realize.

1904
01:20:42,451 --> 01:20:44,010
It's like the DOS equis fucking guy.

1905
01:20:48,440 --> 01:20:53,440
You ever see him hanging out with Betty 
White and a bunch of old hags do you 

1906
01:20:53,440 --> 01:20:54,690
know?
He's hanging out with 19 year old chants

1907
01:20:54,700 --> 01:20:56,660
at the mall and there's always like two 
of them,

1908
01:20:56,661 --> 01:20:58,970
but there's always a third one that 
comes and she's like,

1909
01:20:58,971 --> 01:21:00,410
why are you hanging out with this creepy
guy?

1910
01:21:00,650 --> 01:21:02,840
He's old little girls like he's not 
creepy.

1911
01:21:03,290 --> 01:21:04,880
He's just lonely.
His wife died.

1912
01:21:04,910 --> 01:21:07,700
He just wants to conversation.
He doesn't want none from us.

1913
01:21:07,880 --> 01:21:12,880
He's like your grandpa and all of a 
sudden there's that one girl that goes,

1914
01:21:15,830 --> 01:21:19,040
grandpa,
he fucking around with these old guys.

1915
01:21:19,041 --> 01:21:23,100
You will suck one of their fucking dicks
because patient,

1916
01:21:23,210 --> 01:21:27,620
they're very patient and like young guys
go right for you.

1917
01:21:27,621 --> 01:21:32,621
A little vagina on old guy throws you in
a web and they play you like they 

1918
01:21:37,521 --> 01:21:40,550
fucking call on you.
You ladies have been taken by an old guy

1919
01:21:40,820 --> 01:21:45,820
at one point your fucking life.
They rock your world and they'll fuck 

1920
01:21:45,820 --> 01:21:48,971
your brains out.
You catch them with some good old blood 

1921
01:21:48,971 --> 01:21:48,971
transfusion or they been eating that 
shit.

1922
01:21:49,430 --> 01:21:54,430
I had a friend who was a stripper that 
said she went home with a 50 year old 

1923
01:21:54,430 --> 01:21:54,470
guy one night.
She didn't walk for three fucking days.

1924
01:21:55,240 --> 01:21:56,480
I'd go again.
That's not me.

1925
01:21:56,481 --> 01:21:58,490
I come in a minute and a half,
but it's not me at all.

1926
01:21:59,090 --> 01:22:04,090
I'm just talking about that.
There's guys out there that will rock 

1927
01:22:04,090 --> 01:22:04,090
your fucking world and liberace was 
probably one of them.

1928
01:22:04,090 --> 01:22:09,080
The other guy that played,
the guy that fell in love with him was 

1929
01:22:09,080 --> 01:22:12,401
played by Matt Damon.
Now I love Matt Damon.

1930
01:22:13,161 --> 01:22:15,680
I'm watching this and I'm like,
this is going to be fucked up.

1931
01:22:15,681 --> 01:22:20,681
Matt Damon plays a confused kid that 
he's bisexual and one night he goes to 

1932
01:22:20,961 --> 01:22:23,850
see liberace play the fucking piano at 
EDC,

1933
01:22:23,900 --> 01:22:25,460
gets impressed by liberace.
He goes,

1934
01:22:25,461 --> 01:22:30,461
oh my God,
look at the way he's moving his head 

1935
01:22:30,461 --> 01:22:32,650
that an afterward he sneaks into vip,
at least sneaks in with this little 

1936
01:22:32,650 --> 01:22:33,860
blonde hair.
He looks beautiful.

1937
01:22:33,861 --> 01:22:38,210
Matt Damon,
he's all yoked up and shit and liberace.

1938
01:22:38,211 --> 01:22:43,211
He's got his robe on with his sandals 
and he looks and he sees Matt Damon and 

1939
01:22:43,211 --> 01:22:47,360
you could see he loses his fucking mind.
He's just looking at them with that gay.

1940
01:22:47,361 --> 01:22:50,480
Looked to him like,
I'm going to fucking kill this pork chop

1941
01:22:50,510 --> 01:22:51,290
when I get my hand.

1942
01:22:51,720 --> 01:22:52,340
No,

1943
01:22:54,050 --> 01:22:59,050
Matt Damon sees this.
Andrew Santina was a dig and he's 

1944
01:22:59,050 --> 01:22:59,050
looking at me.
He walks over to him.

1945
01:22:59,050 --> 01:22:59,050
He goes,
oh my God,

1946
01:22:59,050 --> 01:23:03,701
Linda playing something.
He started texting people or I was 

1947
01:23:03,701 --> 01:23:05,030
taking selfies.
I'm pushing the show.

1948
01:23:05,170 --> 01:23:05,730
Oh you,

1949
01:23:06,170 --> 01:23:11,170
thank you.
When I was a kid and I can't shut it 

1950
01:23:11,170 --> 01:23:11,170
off,
I'll go,

1951
01:23:11,170 --> 01:23:13,180
we'll go listen to the bit folks to run 
the candelabra.

1952
01:23:13,330 --> 01:23:18,330
The problem with like planning a bit,
everybody stops and then you pull your 

1953
01:23:18,330 --> 01:23:21,751
phone out while I was checking to see 
about the shit to be there for it there 

1954
01:23:21,751 --> 01:23:22,840
and forgot to put it back up.
So that was on youtube.

1955
01:23:22,841 --> 01:23:25,000
Either half of it was.
Oh well that's a problem.

1956
01:23:25,170 --> 01:23:27,300
I'll fix the board just for a second 
day.

1957
01:23:27,301 --> 01:23:30,310
The fuck are you listening to you just 
stand there staring.

1958
01:23:30,311 --> 01:23:32,470
We're watching Santina play with his 
phone.

1959
01:23:33,160 --> 01:23:38,160
You're,
you're one of those no cases on your 

1960
01:23:38,160 --> 01:23:38,160
phone.
Fuck that.

1961
01:23:38,160 --> 01:23:38,160
What's the difference in risk taking 
move.

1962
01:23:38,160 --> 01:23:38,630
But.
But what,

1963
01:23:38,631 --> 01:23:39,600
what?
What's gonna Happen?

1964
01:23:39,620 --> 01:23:41,320
That's gonna break.
But then I get a new one.

1965
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:44,810
So first world,
but the apple care shit.

1966
01:23:44,890 --> 01:23:48,460
It's 90 bucks and you get a new one.
But do you want it to get a new one?

1967
01:23:48,490 --> 01:23:53,490
Don't you want to just protect your 
phone so you have to go to the fucking 

1968
01:23:53,490 --> 01:23:53,490
apple store when you drop your phone.
Here's my argument.

1969
01:23:53,650 --> 01:23:54,980
You have an argument for that here?
Yeah,

1970
01:23:55,060 --> 01:23:56,260
because everyone says it's white.
Look.

1971
01:23:56,570 --> 01:23:58,990
Okay.
This is why I liked the sleekness.

1972
01:23:58,991 --> 01:24:01,060
The design,
the feel is beautiful.

1973
01:24:01,240 --> 01:24:02,650
Then we put cases on them and fuck them 
up.

1974
01:24:02,680 --> 01:24:04,170
They brag about how thin and one of them
they are.

1975
01:24:04,180 --> 01:24:09,180
Then you shove a fucking case on it.
It loses all the beauty and the 

1976
01:24:09,180 --> 01:24:12,781
architecture of why I like the from 
Steve Jobs was in love with the idea of 

1977
01:24:12,781 --> 01:24:14,200
like the design of the phone and that's 
what apple's whole stance used to be.

1978
01:24:14,380 --> 01:24:19,380
Sleekness design could thin like 
everything about it was how sexy it was 

1979
01:24:19,380 --> 01:24:19,990
and then we're like,
yeah,

1980
01:24:19,991 --> 01:24:20,860
put a fucking case on it.

1981
01:24:20,860 --> 01:24:22,720
So it never breaks.
Still succeed with this case.

1982
01:24:23,420 --> 01:24:25,840
No chunky.
This sounds classist,

1983
01:24:25,930 --> 01:24:28,870
but like I have enough money.
You obviously way more than me,

1984
01:24:28,871 --> 01:24:31,750
but like you can afford to break it,
so I just don't care if I.

1985
01:24:32,500 --> 01:24:35,170
most Americans that like breaking a 
phone is a big deal.

1986
01:24:35,260 --> 01:24:37,180
I get it.
I can afford to buy a new phone.

1987
01:24:37,181 --> 01:24:40,810
I don't care.
I know you're so first world.

1988
01:24:40,830 --> 01:24:41,950
Yeah,
but that's fucking honest.

1989
01:24:41,951 --> 01:24:43,290
That's like saying,
you know,

1990
01:24:43,690 --> 01:24:45,730
I get it dude.
Some people treat shit.

1991
01:24:46,150 --> 01:24:50,140
Some people treat it like it's also 
everyone will go.

1992
01:24:50,141 --> 01:24:52,270
Knock on wood,
I've never broken a phone.

1993
01:24:52,420 --> 01:24:55,180
I've never had a case watts.
This is my fifth iphone.

1994
01:24:55,420 --> 01:24:57,720
Come on.
You never broken A.

1995
01:24:57,720 --> 01:25:00,910
I swear on my fucking mother's life.
I've never shattered a phone in my life.

1996
01:25:01,420 --> 01:25:02,590
Never once.
I've never had a case.

1997
01:25:02,650 --> 01:25:04,420
You Ever Shit your pants twice?

1998
01:25:04,990 --> 01:25:05,980
Once,
once in Japan.

1999
01:25:05,981 --> 01:25:08,170
Once here ever.
I Shit my pants.

2000
01:25:08,650 --> 01:25:10,250
Ever once in Japan.
Once,

2001
01:25:10,270 --> 01:25:11,020
here,
here.

2002
01:25:11,021 --> 01:25:13,240
Not here,
here and right here in the studio.

2003
01:25:13,270 --> 01:25:17,050
I'm shitting my pants.
I Shit my pants in Japan.

2004
01:25:17,051 --> 01:25:18,340
That's a real fucking story.
Yeah.

2005
01:25:18,341 --> 01:25:19,260
What happened?
We,

2006
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:21,310
we,
we went out the night before.

2007
01:25:21,311 --> 01:25:26,311
I had the most fun I've ever had in my 
entire life and my stomach was not 

2008
01:25:26,311 --> 01:25:29,611
having a good time with whatever we ate 
for breakfast and I was walking the 

2009
01:25:29,611 --> 01:25:32,281
street.
We were going to a temple and I and I 

2010
01:25:32,281 --> 01:25:32,281
had,
I just had a little,

2011
01:25:32,281 --> 01:25:34,300
a little far came out and I and I 
stopped and I thought,

2012
01:25:34,720 --> 01:25:36,040
no,
no way.

2013
01:25:36,310 --> 01:25:37,840
No Way.
Really.

2014
01:25:37,960 --> 01:25:38,860
I couldn't.
Like,

2015
01:25:38,861 --> 01:25:41,170
I couldn't comprehend it.
Actually it happened.

2016
01:25:41,340 --> 01:25:46,340
I had to go to like a little seven,
11 type place and in this little tiny 

2017
01:25:46,340 --> 01:25:46,340
room,
take off my pants,

2018
01:25:46,340 --> 01:25:51,180
take off my shit,
underwear leaving in the fucking in the 

2019
01:25:51,180 --> 01:25:51,430
bathroom and then and then go wrong.

2020
01:25:51,550 --> 01:25:54,790
Even shit underwear and bathrooms brewed
move.

2021
01:25:54,820 --> 01:25:58,250
And now I know those people have to go 
in there and smell that underwear.

2022
01:25:58,600 --> 01:26:01,150
I just posted in the trashcan and I 
covered up as much as I could.

2023
01:26:01,370 --> 01:26:03,980
You coming up the smell?
Shit.

2024
01:26:03,981 --> 01:26:08,981
The trashcan out.
Why don't you throw it in the garbage 

2025
01:26:08,981 --> 01:26:09,890
can outside.
Carried out.

2026
01:26:09,950 --> 01:26:11,490
Carried out two fingers.
My poop.

2027
01:26:11,491 --> 01:26:12,800
When my shit.
My Shit underwear.

2028
01:26:12,880 --> 01:26:14,090
Yeah.
No,

2029
01:26:14,150 --> 01:26:15,140
just go like this.
No,

2030
01:26:16,120 --> 01:26:17,390
no.
I had shit.

2031
01:26:17,400 --> 01:26:20,300
I had to throw it right in the trash can
and disappear.

2032
01:26:20,720 --> 01:26:21,620
That's kind of like.
Yeah,

2033
01:26:21,621 --> 01:26:23,270
but that's not okay.
Okay.

2034
01:26:23,540 --> 01:26:27,140
This isn't that uncommon like in a lot 
of places around the world.

2035
01:26:27,260 --> 01:26:29,990
You can't throw toilet paper in the 
toilet.

2036
01:26:29,991 --> 01:26:31,480
You have to put it in the trash can.
What?

2037
01:26:31,610 --> 01:26:32,090
Yeah.
Fuck.

2038
01:26:32,091 --> 01:26:32,810
Yeah.
Yeah.

2039
01:26:32,890 --> 01:26:35,990
You go to central and South America.
You can't.

2040
01:26:36,020 --> 01:26:37,790
They don't.
They say please no toilet paper.

2041
01:26:37,900 --> 01:26:41,260
So people shit in the toilet and then 
they throw the fuck.

2042
01:26:41,280 --> 01:26:42,960
They're asked wipes in the trash.
Jamie say,

2043
01:26:42,961 --> 01:26:44,980
alright,
I'm not playing.

2044
01:26:45,320 --> 01:26:46,700
You've never been to a country like 
that.

2045
01:26:47,750 --> 01:26:50,720
Maybe I didn't read their sign because 
they don't because the pipes are old.

2046
01:26:50,721 --> 01:26:52,400
They can't handle all that.
People pay.

2047
01:26:52,420 --> 01:26:54,980
Fix your pipes.
You fucking cave people.

2048
01:26:54,981 --> 01:26:58,490
Fucking cave.
Monks get pvc.

2049
01:26:58,520 --> 01:26:59,600
Cheap.
Fuck Dude.

2050
01:26:59,601 --> 01:27:03,500
In Thailand,
every bathroom that I went to right next

2051
01:27:03,501 --> 01:27:08,501
to the toilet has a goddamn garden hose.
Like you would use to wash your car on 

2052
01:27:08,501 --> 01:27:08,750
your ass.
Yeah,

2053
01:27:08,751 --> 01:27:10,400
like nothing.
Not a gentle,

2054
01:27:10,401 --> 01:27:12,780
but day like we have those toilets.
Those.

2055
01:27:12,850 --> 01:27:15,650
What do they bond Dell's.
Those are so dope.

2056
01:27:15,710 --> 01:27:16,760
Yeah,
they're amazing.

2057
01:27:16,761 --> 01:27:18,020
Yeah.
The seats warm.

2058
01:27:18,021 --> 01:27:20,360
When you sit down,
you press the button,

2059
01:27:20,900 --> 01:27:25,430
a gentle warm jet of air hits your butt 
hole and like,

2060
01:27:25,850 --> 01:27:26,720
oh,
that's so nice.

2061
01:27:26,890 --> 01:27:29,120
Yeah.
This wasn't like that at all.

2062
01:27:29,300 --> 01:27:31,950
This was a Goddamn like you'd clean an 
elephant with a green.

2063
01:27:31,970 --> 01:27:32,980
Whoa.
A garden hose.

2064
01:27:33,100 --> 01:27:34,700
No.
It's like one of those guns.

2065
01:27:34,701 --> 01:27:35,130
You know,
you,

2066
01:27:35,140 --> 01:27:36,660
you have a lot of pressure on it.

2067
01:27:38,680 --> 01:27:43,680
That's what it was.
You can't flush the toilet paper down 

2068
01:27:43,680 --> 01:27:47,651
the loo and these European countries.
You go my friend or look at all these 

2069
01:27:47,651 --> 01:27:47,651
different ones.
Bulgaria,

2070
01:27:47,651 --> 01:27:48,200
Turkey,
Greece,

2071
01:27:48,210 --> 01:27:49,160
Turkey,
Greece,

2072
01:27:49,370 --> 01:27:52,640
Macedonia.
You can't flush toilet paper.

2073
01:27:52,850 --> 01:27:54,350
You can.
It'll fucking break a pipe though.

2074
01:27:55,100 --> 01:27:58,640
What kind of thin walled pipes they have
over there?

2075
01:27:58,641 --> 01:28:00,330
That toilet paper's breaking big.
No,

2076
01:28:00,350 --> 01:28:02,870
that doesn't make any sense.
The mass amount,

2077
01:28:02,960 --> 01:28:06,770
it clogs up.
The pipes are too many people.

2078
01:28:06,771 --> 01:28:08,210
Shit.
No one seems so crazy.

2079
01:28:08,211 --> 01:28:13,211
Like what?
Have you have a lot of fiber in your 

2080
01:28:13,211 --> 01:28:14,651
pool?
Like what if you're eating a lot of 

2081
01:28:14,651 --> 01:28:14,651
Broccoli and you have like elephant type
who?

2082
01:28:15,200 --> 01:28:17,390
Riley in rock shit.
Another thing in Thailand,

2083
01:28:17,391 --> 01:28:22,391
they sell poop paper.
They sell paper that they make out of 

2084
01:28:22,391 --> 01:28:22,391
elephant shit.
Yeah,

2085
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:27,400
because elephant shit is all fiber.
So what they do is they take that 

2086
01:28:27,400 --> 01:28:27,400
elephant shit.

2087
01:28:27,400 --> 01:28:31,420
They wash out the fecal bacteria and 
they use the actual plant fiber 

2088
01:28:31,790 --> 01:28:36,790
material.
They turned that into the toilet paper 

2089
01:28:36,790 --> 01:28:36,790
and you.
It's a novelty.

2090
01:28:36,790 --> 01:28:39,350
You wipe your ass with elephant shit.
So you wipe your shit with Shit.

2091
01:28:39,410 --> 01:28:41,000
You're wiping horseshit.
Yeah.

2092
01:28:41,030 --> 01:28:43,480
How does it.
It can't smell good even if they've done

2093
01:28:43,500 --> 01:28:44,660
by the smell and it.
Bro.

2094
01:28:45,020 --> 01:28:47,780
What is this poop paper park?
Yeah,

2095
01:28:47,781 --> 01:28:49,380
that's it.
Elephant who?

2096
01:28:49,381 --> 01:28:52,050
Paper poop paper.
The poop poop poop.

2097
01:28:52,100 --> 01:28:52,510
Yeah.
Paypal.

2098
01:28:52,520 --> 01:28:57,520
They take it and they break it down.
Building a future in which humans live 

2099
01:28:57,520 --> 01:28:58,030
in harmony with nature.
Okay.

2100
01:28:58,790 --> 01:29:02,060
And they sell this stuff and wipe your 
butt

2101
01:29:02,070 --> 01:29:04,800
with it.
Who sold here?

2102
01:29:04,980 --> 01:29:06,210
Funny.
I get all of it.

2103
01:29:06,450 --> 01:29:08,200
Uh,

2104
01:29:11,300 --> 01:29:14,520
it's like when someone has a clever 
family reunion shirt and it's just like,

2105
01:29:14,521 --> 01:29:15,560
okay,
I got it.

2106
01:29:15,640 --> 01:29:16,830
Fuck it.
You know what?

2107
01:29:16,831 --> 01:29:18,390
I'm sick and fucking tired of who by the
way,

2108
01:29:18,391 --> 01:29:23,391
people that make shitty slide jokes.
I think they're funny flight attendants 

2109
01:29:23,391 --> 01:29:27,291
now that are trying to make her like 
funny little jokes that that's like a 

2110
01:29:27,291 --> 01:29:30,411
culture now.
Do you know what I'm talking about on 

2111
01:29:30,411 --> 01:29:30,411
the fucking Internet started it.
Yeah.

2112
01:29:30,411 --> 01:29:31,380
But a lot of other airlines are doing 
because they think it's cute,

2113
01:29:31,470 --> 01:29:33,840
like southwest does it all the time 
because their trash,

2114
01:29:33,841 --> 01:29:36,450
they don't give a fuck fucking trash 
cans and this guy,

2115
01:29:37,050 --> 01:29:41,610
but no seriously unlike maybe delta,
but like they make little cute jokes.

2116
01:29:41,611 --> 01:29:43,890
Like if you don't know what we have to 
drink,

2117
01:29:43,950 --> 01:29:48,950
maybe you've never flown before because 
it's been the same thing for 20 years 

2118
01:29:48,950 --> 01:29:50,880
and then a few people like few idiots on
the plane that you're.

2119
01:29:50,970 --> 01:29:53,160
Don't make jokes.
Did fucking this isn't the time.

2120
01:29:53,370 --> 01:29:56,010
Just tell me that bullshit and go sit 
the fuck down and shut up.

2121
01:29:56,080 --> 01:29:57,420
Dude.
I don't like the jokes.

2122
01:29:57,421 --> 01:30:00,780
This is coming from a guy who makes 
jokes for a living for money.

2123
01:30:00,781 --> 01:30:05,781
That's not their job.
Their job is to make sure I get my 

2124
01:30:05,781 --> 01:30:05,781
fucking sprite.
Let them in my peanuts.

2125
01:30:05,781 --> 01:30:06,330
A little rush.
Fuck them,

2126
01:30:06,331 --> 01:30:07,590
Jo.
I don't like them.

2127
01:30:07,680 --> 01:30:10,680
I don't like them.
Do you remember the first thing that you

2128
01:30:10,681 --> 01:30:12,690
ever did in front of a group of people 
that got a laugh?

2129
01:30:13,500 --> 01:30:15,180
Like a little inappropriate laugh?
Yeah.

2130
01:30:15,181 --> 01:30:17,180
My Buddy's sleepover type of shit.
Yeah.

2131
01:30:17,210 --> 01:30:19,200
Little thrill that you get with that.
Inappropriate.

2132
01:30:19,230 --> 01:30:20,250
Yeah,
but it's not my job.

2133
01:30:20,880 --> 01:30:25,880
Their job is to be the flight of 10.
I don't need the job from the flight 

2134
01:30:25,880 --> 01:30:25,880
attendant.
She's so rude.

2135
01:30:25,880 --> 01:30:25,890
Fuck them.
He was so mean.

2136
01:30:25,980 --> 01:30:27,400
They're fucking mean.
Use their man.

2137
01:30:27,930 --> 01:30:30,000
They're fucking mean.
Most of them are assholes.

2138
01:30:30,030 --> 01:30:34,020
One Lady told me that I had to put my 
fanny pack in the overhead compartment,

2139
01:30:34,021 --> 01:30:36,720
fine,
shake it off and how to use it as a bag.

2140
01:30:36,730 --> 01:30:38,280
I a stored as a bag.
I'm like,

2141
01:30:38,281 --> 01:30:41,160
why should I go?
What if I take everything out of the bag

2142
01:30:41,161 --> 01:30:43,980
and put it in my pockets you could do,
and then she couldn't say.

2143
01:30:43,990 --> 01:30:45,720
She just take the bag off.
I'm like,

2144
01:30:45,721 --> 01:30:48,600
this is a power move.
No one's ever told me that before.

2145
01:30:48,601 --> 01:30:50,730
One Lady told me to take the fanny pack 
off.

2146
01:30:50,850 --> 01:30:53,160
I think she was just anti fanny pack,
but you don't see.

2147
01:30:53,161 --> 01:30:58,161
But you know this and Americans that 
have experienced that know when you fly 

2148
01:30:58,161 --> 01:31:02,221
in business or first they treat you like
a fucking king and when you fly in the 

2149
01:31:02,221 --> 01:31:02,890
bud of the plane,
they don't give a fuck about true.

2150
01:31:03,360 --> 01:31:04,860
This was in first class?
Yeah,

2151
01:31:04,870 --> 01:31:08,070
but she was doing that because she's fed
up with whatever her day was,

2152
01:31:08,190 --> 01:31:09,900
but most time they let you get away with
anything.

2153
01:31:10,020 --> 01:31:14,700
I think she was Chubby and she wasn't 
getting Dick and that fancy.

2154
01:31:14,720 --> 01:31:19,720
I felt at the time to fanny packs,
you get snack and I just asked you a 

2155
01:31:19,720 --> 01:31:21,330
question,
are you chubby and do not get any dick?

2156
01:31:21,450 --> 01:31:24,060
Is that why you're doing this?
Imagine if you said that.

2157
01:31:24,090 --> 01:31:29,090
I just need to know before I put my 
fanny pack away just because of a lack 

2158
01:31:29,090 --> 01:31:29,090
of Dick.
It'd be great if she goes,

2159
01:31:29,090 --> 01:31:30,090
you know what?
Yes.

2160
01:31:30,270 --> 01:31:35,270
And then just walked away.
You want to give me some deck you can 

2161
01:31:35,270 --> 01:31:35,310
wear the fact that you fucked me with 
just the fatty package.

2162
01:31:35,390 --> 01:31:39,090
Back Click taking it off overhead 
apartment.

2163
01:31:39,091 --> 01:31:44,091
It is.
I'll be right back with liberace winks 

2164
01:31:44,091 --> 01:31:44,091
sent me today.

2165
01:31:45,450 --> 01:31:47,800
I can't wait till everyone at home has 
that stuck in their fucking heads.

2166
01:31:48,300 --> 01:31:53,300
I started to shake.
I was articulate the things that people 

2167
01:31:55,861 --> 01:31:58,110
thought were entertaining and like the 
fifties,

2168
01:31:58,170 --> 01:32:01,210
it's so strange.
You go back now and watch that stuff,

2169
01:32:01,250 --> 01:32:04,420
but that was like a.
That was almost like sultry to back.

2170
01:32:04,421 --> 01:32:06,130
Then you know that she's like with our 
pen,

2171
01:32:06,131 --> 01:32:09,610
like this innocent girl writing note.
What the fuck was she even writing down?

2172
01:32:09,611 --> 01:32:10,960
And then she's,
she's gone.

2173
01:32:11,650 --> 01:32:13,530
Oh,
just when the piano man winks at me,

2174
01:32:13,540 --> 01:32:15,100
like that's the naughtiest shit of the 
day.

2175
01:32:15,160 --> 01:32:19,690
If I had a time machine,
what I would love to do is take like all

2176
01:32:19,691 --> 01:32:24,691
these old folks that are like in,
in the audience watching that weren't 

2177
01:32:24,691 --> 01:32:24,760
even old folks at the time.
Right.

2178
01:32:25,300 --> 01:32:30,300
Young people like in their thirties 
thought that was wonderful and put on 

2179
01:32:30,341 --> 01:32:32,410
like a modern day mumble rapper.

2180
01:32:33,850 --> 01:32:38,840
Have 20 people on stage with them,
puff and blow,

2181
01:32:39,290 --> 01:32:41,500
you know,
freaking fucking lean and trap,

2182
01:32:41,501 --> 01:32:45,000
trap,
trap music and just give it a hobby.

2183
01:32:45,010 --> 01:32:46,950
The booze were already did the,
about who these people.

2184
01:32:46,970 --> 01:32:50,620
Just like,
like the kid with the hair,

2185
01:32:50,970 --> 01:32:53,290
the rainbow hair kid.
What's his fucking name?

2186
01:32:53,400 --> 01:32:55,840
Is he a mumble rapper guy got beat up in
New York.

2187
01:32:56,170 --> 01:32:58,540
He got pistol whipped right?
Allegedly.

2188
01:32:59,040 --> 01:33:04,040
You never know when a guy like that you 
made it up himself was just gonna say 

2189
01:33:04,040 --> 01:33:04,040
that's a great promo.
Yeah.

2190
01:33:04,040 --> 01:33:06,310
He might have punched himself in the 
head because I saw a photo online.

2191
01:33:06,311 --> 01:33:08,440
It didn't look like he got.
Why can't I think of his name?

2192
01:33:08,770 --> 01:33:13,770
A friend of mine was breaking up with 
her husband at the time and they were 

2193
01:33:13,770 --> 01:33:15,250
screaming and yell at each other and 
dude starts clawing at himself,

2194
01:33:15,900 --> 01:33:19,540
start to scratch marks on him saying 
that she was attacking him,

2195
01:33:19,690 --> 01:33:21,520
ripped his clothes.
He called the police,

2196
01:33:21,780 --> 01:33:22,490
a guy did it.

2197
01:33:24,940 --> 01:33:29,940
Listen,
it's not outside the realm of 

2198
01:33:29,940 --> 01:33:31,400
possibility.
A mumble rapper took that fucking dunked

2199
01:33:31,420 --> 01:33:33,410
himself at the head,
the security to call,

2200
01:33:33,430 --> 01:33:36,580
call the ambulance right away when in 
this day and age,

2201
01:33:36,610 --> 01:33:39,280
people are just doing anything to stay 
relevant,

2202
01:33:39,320 --> 01:33:41,380
to stay relevant,
to get attention.

2203
01:33:41,440 --> 01:33:42,370
They'll do anything.
Well,

2204
01:33:42,371 --> 01:33:44,140
that's what the.
That's what instagram has become.

2205
01:33:44,141 --> 01:33:48,490
That's what the Internet has become.
It's just become the way to be like what

2206
01:33:48,491 --> 01:33:53,491
it's become,
but it's certainly a venue for people 

2207
01:33:53,491 --> 01:33:53,560
that don't have any other options.
It's big.

2208
01:33:53,561 --> 01:33:54,580
It works.
A lot of people make,

2209
01:33:54,610 --> 01:33:56,650
make actual careers on just on 
Instagram,

2210
01:33:56,740 --> 01:33:59,710
but there's people that like Kendrick 
Lamar is not doing that.

2211
01:33:59,980 --> 01:34:00,310
Yeah,
he's.

2212
01:34:00,580 --> 01:34:01,780
Yeah,
but what I'm saying,

2213
01:34:01,870 --> 01:34:03,790
he doesn't need that shit where he 
doesn't need that shit,

2214
01:34:03,910 --> 01:34:08,910
but some people do need that shit.
Then they're tattooing their face and 

2215
01:34:08,910 --> 01:34:09,430
mumble rap and pistol whipping 
themselves.

2216
01:34:09,430 --> 01:34:11,020
Face Tattoo blows.
It blows my mind.

2217
01:34:11,140 --> 01:34:13,150
Do you know that Travis Barker just got 
a new one?

2218
01:34:13,480 --> 01:34:18,480
She got a face.
Tattoos says blessed where on his cheek 

2219
01:34:18,480 --> 01:34:18,480
we doin,
Bro.

2220
01:34:18,480 --> 01:34:20,500
He's just.
He's covered man.

2221
01:34:20,530 --> 01:34:22,030
He's got a little more room.
I see and yeah,

2222
01:34:22,031 --> 01:34:23,320
he's had his whole name.
I know his whole.

2223
01:34:23,321 --> 01:34:25,200
All of his neck has done.
He's done.

2224
01:34:25,210 --> 01:34:27,280
Is he heads done but he stopped at one 
point,

2225
01:34:27,281 --> 01:34:27,760
right?
He doesn't.

2226
01:34:27,761 --> 01:34:29,240
He never did his face.
Yeah,

2227
01:34:29,241 --> 01:34:30,790
he's done.
He's doing his face now.

2228
01:34:31,310 --> 01:34:32,420
Shit.
Yeah.

2229
01:34:32,950 --> 01:34:36,220
It's on his instagram.
Says blessed right below his cheeks.

2230
01:34:36,340 --> 01:34:37,360
No.
Who's the guy who wrote?

2231
01:34:37,450 --> 01:34:39,370
Always tired.
Post Malone.

2232
01:34:39,460 --> 01:34:40,610
Post Malone.
Yeah.

2233
01:34:40,660 --> 01:34:41,800
Above his eyebrow.
Right.

2234
01:34:41,801 --> 01:34:44,010
It's not on his eyebrow.
Below his eyebrow.

2235
01:34:44,050 --> 01:34:49,050
Somebody had a great meme of post Malone
and in high school his high school 

2236
01:34:49,050 --> 01:34:49,050
yearbook photo and they wrote pre 
malone.

2237
01:34:49,050 --> 01:34:49,600
I thought that was hilarious.

2238
01:34:51,620 --> 01:34:56,620
That was not the face tattoo thing is.
It's a bummer because there was no 

2239
01:34:57,650 --> 01:35:00,320
authorities.
Look shared dude.

2240
01:35:00,321 --> 01:35:02,930
What the fuck he had done.
He's blessed bro.

2241
01:35:03,170 --> 01:35:05,930
How blessed,
what got on top of his head to his whole

2242
01:35:06,050 --> 01:35:08,150
head.
The entire head.

2243
01:35:08,180 --> 01:35:09,230
Right.
But if you grow out his hair,

2244
01:35:09,231 --> 01:35:10,220
you wouldn't see it.
Right?

2245
01:35:10,310 --> 01:35:11,930
That's the thing.
Yeah,

2246
01:35:11,960 --> 01:35:16,010
he.
But that is fucking come on the head.

2247
01:35:16,011 --> 01:35:18,650
The full head tattoos a trip.
You one man.

2248
01:35:18,800 --> 01:35:23,800
The top of your head.
Like could you ever get one on your 

2249
01:35:23,800 --> 01:35:23,800
head?
I'm sure my whole arms are done,

2250
01:35:23,800 --> 01:35:24,480
I'm sure.
But I mean,

2251
01:35:24,490 --> 01:35:26,690
would you.
Would you ever want to know?

2252
01:35:26,750 --> 01:35:28,310
Never.
I don't think so.

2253
01:35:28,311 --> 01:35:30,260
Maybe.
Maybe the back of my head.

2254
01:35:30,261 --> 01:35:33,110
A Bake Eagle for a big.
That's him when he was young.

2255
01:35:33,140 --> 01:35:34,730
Look at that.
Is that him?

2256
01:35:34,731 --> 01:35:37,130
No tattoos.
It's not come on really,

2257
01:35:37,310 --> 01:35:39,160
really younger.
Say Wow.

2258
01:35:39,280 --> 01:35:40,480
Oh Wow.
Is that a cigar?

2259
01:35:40,481 --> 01:35:41,950
A blunt?
I think it's got to be.

2260
01:35:43,980 --> 01:35:48,980
God The knows that bold thing.
Septum don't like that one on chicks.

2261
01:35:50,211 --> 01:35:51,600
It's kind of sexy.
It's grow.

2262
01:35:51,601 --> 01:35:56,601
Some chicks.
The chicks with the nostril one I think 

2263
01:35:56,601 --> 01:35:59,981
is sexy right here.
You don't like this weird except them 

2264
01:35:59,981 --> 01:35:59,981
can be.
Cool.

2265
01:35:59,981 --> 01:36:04,150
Listen,
the one thing that's cool about it as a 

2266
01:36:04,150 --> 01:36:04,150
girl with a tattoo will definitely suck 
your Dick.

2267
01:36:05,540 --> 01:36:09,050
She's not scared of controversy or get 
it yet.

2268
01:36:09,860 --> 01:36:10,610
What's that one?
What's that?

2269
01:36:10,611 --> 01:36:11,230
Video?
What?

2270
01:36:11,270 --> 01:36:11,810
Oh,
see that.

2271
01:36:11,811 --> 01:36:13,820
Go there to that video with him where 
you see his shirts off.

2272
01:36:13,821 --> 01:36:15,410
It's all the way up his neck and his 
face and shit.

2273
01:36:15,530 --> 01:36:16,970
Yeah.
Yeah.

2274
01:36:16,971 --> 01:36:19,790
He's tatted the fuck out.
I mean his whole body.

2275
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:21,980
He's completely covered.
Front and back.

2276
01:36:22,070 --> 01:36:23,780
Jesus.
That's a strange thing.

2277
01:36:23,781 --> 01:36:27,710
Then people do that coming from a guy 
with two sleeves.

2278
01:36:28,430 --> 01:36:28,880
Yeah,
but how.

2279
01:36:29,040 --> 01:36:31,640
But what do you think the.
What do you think the movement is to get

2280
01:36:31,641 --> 01:36:32,570
another one at this point?

2281
01:36:32,600 --> 01:36:34,370
Because you have a lot.
Do you want to get more?

2282
01:36:34,880 --> 01:36:37,430
I'd like to finish my right sleeve.
Yeah,

2283
01:36:37,431 --> 01:36:39,200
but I'm saying Brent,
branching away from the sleeves.

2284
01:36:39,201 --> 01:36:41,030
Like is it now the next thing you'd be 
like,

2285
01:36:41,050 --> 01:36:42,260
you know,
I'll fuck with my neck now.

2286
01:36:42,380 --> 01:36:43,630
I don't know man.
Maybe he'll leg.

2287
01:36:43,910 --> 01:36:45,920
Maybe a calf.
Get a calf done.

2288
01:36:46,100 --> 01:36:48,320
Yeah,
I have zero.

2289
01:36:48,650 --> 01:36:50,030
How come?
I don't know.

2290
01:36:50,480 --> 01:36:55,480
I think we've talked about this before.
I think you get across your stomach a 

2291
01:36:55,480 --> 01:36:55,780
gangland style.
Ginger's rule.

2292
01:36:55,810 --> 01:36:57,530
Rope.
Ginger's rule.

2293
01:36:57,700 --> 01:37:00,200
Yeah.
Ginge the Gel,

2294
01:37:00,240 --> 01:37:00,650
right?
Joe?

2295
01:37:00,680 --> 01:37:02,670
The ginger on my chest.
How about suck?

2296
01:37:02,671 --> 01:37:07,671
Not Carrot Shelf.
Eat My carrot right above my dick.

2297
01:37:11,360 --> 01:37:12,880
Get your vitamin K right.
If I.

2298
01:37:13,040 --> 01:37:15,290
What if I did a.
What if I did a bunny rabbit?

2299
01:37:15,291 --> 01:37:16,850
Right?
Right next to my cock.

2300
01:37:16,880 --> 01:37:17,930
Yeah.
Nice.

2301
01:37:17,960 --> 01:37:18,680
Do you know a.
do you know?

2302
01:37:18,681 --> 01:37:19,860
This article came out about redheads.

2303
01:37:19,880 --> 01:37:24,880
We produce our own vitamin D.
You have to at like twice the rate of a 

2304
01:37:24,880 --> 01:37:24,880
normal human being.
In fact,

2305
01:37:24,880 --> 01:37:27,170
while you're so white.
Thanks.

2306
01:37:27,600 --> 01:37:29,390
I'm not that white for a redhead.
I'm not that bad.

2307
01:37:29,420 --> 01:37:31,960
He's fucking more pale than I.
Am you guys getting angry?

2308
01:37:32,660 --> 01:37:34,460
He does.
That's the thing.

2309
01:37:34,620 --> 01:37:35,540
Irish.
Yeah.

2310
01:37:35,580 --> 01:37:38,030
That's the whole reason why people got 
white in the first place.

2311
01:37:38,060 --> 01:37:39,390
We don't,
but I read redheads,

2312
01:37:39,391 --> 01:37:41,300
pacifically producers more than any 
other.

2313
01:37:41,570 --> 01:37:44,090
We produce twice as much.
Vitamin D is anybody else on the planet?

2314
01:37:44,091 --> 01:37:44,900
Wow.
Yeah.

2315
01:37:45,110 --> 01:37:46,760
I wonder if there's a correlation,
but you read heads.

2316
01:37:46,761 --> 01:37:51,761
Been happy because vitamin D is one of 
the things that fucks people up like in 

2317
01:37:51,761 --> 01:37:51,890
Seattle.
It does.

2318
01:37:51,970 --> 01:37:52,760
Yeah,
it does.

2319
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:55,160
That's why they tell people the most red
heads are happy.

2320
01:37:55,320 --> 01:38:00,320
You think there's.
Do you think there's a correlation 

2321
01:38:00,320 --> 01:38:00,320
between A.
I don't know,

2322
01:38:00,320 --> 01:38:00,320
a lot of funny,
mean Burger.

2323
01:38:00,320 --> 01:38:02,270
You Louie.
Three really funny redheads.

2324
01:38:02,280 --> 01:38:03,300
Yeah,
but I would say this though,

2325
01:38:03,390 --> 01:38:08,390
the majority of American red had 
different than European red heads 

2326
01:38:08,390 --> 01:38:09,260
because they grew up in dreary shit.
Right?

2327
01:38:09,540 --> 01:38:11,970
So their conditions are different.
Will you have sun?

2328
01:38:12,180 --> 01:38:17,180
You live in California.
Every state probably have massive 

2329
01:38:17,180 --> 01:38:17,180
amounts of vitamin D.
probably too much.

2330
01:38:17,180 --> 01:38:17,640
Like if someone checked you out,
they'd be like,

2331
01:38:17,641 --> 01:38:22,360
this guy's dying a vitamin D.
he's overdosing on vitamin D and d here.

2332
01:38:22,450 --> 01:38:23,490
Santino data,
vitamin D,

2333
01:38:23,500 --> 01:38:24,870
Man,
it's fucking terrible.

2334
01:38:25,410 --> 01:38:28,800
That is a weird thing that we have a 
vitamin that we get from the star.

2335
01:38:28,970 --> 01:38:30,240
Yeah.
That's star.

2336
01:38:30,241 --> 01:38:32,400
That gives us a vitamin.
Yeah.

2337
01:38:33,140 --> 01:38:37,560
I mean we make it ourselves,
but we get it from exposure to a star.

2338
01:38:37,620 --> 01:38:40,950
You've read about these people that just
like eat sunlight for breakfast.

2339
01:38:41,250 --> 01:38:44,040
You know this shit,
you've never heard of this shit,

2340
01:38:45,220 --> 01:38:45,490
Joe.

2341
01:38:45,540 --> 01:38:47,190
This is real.
He knows me.

2342
01:38:47,191 --> 01:38:49,110
No,
they eat sunlight for breakfast.

2343
01:38:49,111 --> 01:38:50,940
They say that they get supplemental 
stay.

2344
01:38:50,941 --> 01:38:55,941
Get enough supplemental nutrition from 
taking in the sun from certain hours of 

2345
01:38:55,941 --> 01:38:56,290
the day.
That's real.

2346
01:38:56,300 --> 01:38:59,310
I swear to God they live by it.
When I was doing that Scifi show,

2347
01:38:59,640 --> 01:39:00,990
Joe Rogan questions,
everything.

2348
01:39:00,991 --> 01:39:03,120
One of the things we did,
we went to this guy who was.

2349
01:39:04,200 --> 01:39:09,200
He had some cockamamie device that he 
was claiming did something that it 

2350
01:39:09,200 --> 01:39:13,521
really didn't do,
but when we went over to the guy's 

2351
01:39:13,521 --> 01:39:15,561
house,
one of the things he shows me this 

2352
01:39:15,561 --> 01:39:16,170
picture on the wall,
some Indian guy from India with like his

2353
01:39:16,171 --> 01:39:18,570
face is covered in white makeup and I 
go,

2354
01:39:18,571 --> 01:39:20,640
what is this guy's deal?
And he goes like,

2355
01:39:20,700 --> 01:39:22,170
oh,
that's shrieked Bali,

2356
01:39:22,171 --> 01:39:23,320
Gaga.
You know,

2357
01:39:23,340 --> 01:39:28,080
he hasn't eaten any food or drinking any
water in 10 years and impossible.

2358
01:39:28,560 --> 01:39:30,450
Literally impossible is.
I said to him,

2359
01:39:30,451 --> 01:39:31,800
I go,
that's not true.

2360
01:39:32,280 --> 01:39:34,430
What does this Guy Henry called eat the 
sun?

2361
01:39:34,530 --> 01:39:37,800
He bought this bullshit.
Eat The sun.

2362
01:39:38,070 --> 01:39:40,710
He weighs a puny hundred and 35 pounds.
What does that say?

2363
01:39:41,070 --> 01:39:42,540
But he could lift weights.
What does,

2364
01:39:43,920 --> 01:39:45,630
what does it?
But he can.

2365
01:39:46,020 --> 01:39:51,020
He weighs 100,
but they can hoist 965 now knowing 

2366
01:39:51,361 --> 01:39:53,630
fucking impossible.
No,

2367
01:39:53,631 --> 01:39:57,030
he can't look at them with a socks.
Are Those old school gym socks?

2368
01:39:57,150 --> 01:40:01,090
Old School gym socks or coming back to 
the other girls?

2369
01:40:01,340 --> 01:40:04,170
Yeah.
Hot Girl with like old school gym shorts

2370
01:40:04,171 --> 01:40:06,360
and old school gym socks that go up to 
the knee.

2371
01:40:06,480 --> 01:40:08,930
Why is that sexy?
Because it's raw.

2372
01:40:09,030 --> 01:40:14,030
It's reminiscent of like sexy youth does
something youthful about a teen teen 

2373
01:40:14,940 --> 01:40:15,690
summer moving.
Yeah.

2374
01:40:15,810 --> 01:40:18,120
There's something about that.
Like the hot chick with long socks and a

2375
01:40:18,121 --> 01:40:20,010
short skirt.
Socks with Stripes,

2376
01:40:20,560 --> 01:40:22,340
stripes.
Blue Stripe at the top.

2377
01:40:22,810 --> 01:40:26,190
Hot chunky shoes.
Big chunky white shoes underneath.

2378
01:40:26,280 --> 01:40:31,280
Yeah.
What's with the stripes at the top of 

2379
01:40:31,280 --> 01:40:31,280
the sock?
Like the socks are good,

2380
01:40:31,280 --> 01:40:32,490
but you know to make it all perfect.
Fucking stripes of color.

2381
01:40:32,520 --> 01:40:34,920
You know that was an accident and 
threading and they just leave it.

2382
01:40:34,921 --> 01:40:36,410
Yeah.
Come that side.

2383
01:40:36,420 --> 01:40:38,040
It's so fucking hot.
Look at that girl.

2384
01:40:38,080 --> 01:40:41,160
Woo.
The diary of Jane?

2385
01:40:41,310 --> 01:40:42,660
Yeah.
Keep your socks on,

2386
01:40:42,661 --> 01:40:43,650
baby.
Really?

2387
01:40:43,770 --> 01:40:44,460
Yeah.
Yeah.

2388
01:40:44,461 --> 01:40:48,870
Your feet are fucking garbage.
Cover those fucking hooves up.

2389
01:40:50,220 --> 01:40:51,150
Yeah.
That's a look.

2390
01:40:51,180 --> 01:40:52,420
Gym,
socks and pigtails.

2391
01:40:53,100 --> 01:40:54,910
Entire threads dedicated to it.
It's.

2392
01:40:55,180 --> 01:40:56,470
Yeah.
That's weird.

2393
01:40:57,610 --> 01:40:59,920
That's a weird thing that people in see.
Well,

2394
01:40:59,921 --> 01:41:01,600
this is a tube.
Socks.

2395
01:41:01,660 --> 01:41:04,060
Compression socks is a big thing in.
Girls will wear them out out of the.

2396
01:41:04,110 --> 01:41:06,520
Out of cross fit and all that shit.
Now that's a big thing too.

2397
01:41:06,580 --> 01:41:07,960
Why do they wear compression socks?

2398
01:41:08,770 --> 01:41:13,770
What's the benefit of compression socks?
It's the same thing as compression 

2399
01:41:13,770 --> 01:41:13,810
sleeves.
It's exact same thing.

2400
01:41:13,910 --> 01:41:16,180
She keep the muscles warm.
Was that war?

2401
01:41:16,210 --> 01:41:17,290
That would.
It does.

2402
01:41:18,100 --> 01:41:23,100
Athletes.
Certain athletes claim that it helps 

2403
01:41:23,100 --> 01:41:25,411
keep their muscles in between place.
See I've where rash guards for Jujitsu.

2404
01:41:26,770 --> 01:41:28,460
Functional,
but it's compressed.

2405
01:41:28,461 --> 01:41:29,400
It's like,
you know,

2406
01:41:29,500 --> 01:41:31,630
it's compression.
It's like it's tight.

2407
01:41:31,670 --> 01:41:36,370
It's the main functionalities not to get
your skin super fucked up right now.

2408
01:41:36,371 --> 01:41:39,310
There's this for,
for to keep the muscle tightened warm.

2409
01:41:39,490 --> 01:41:42,250
That's weird.
That's fucking weird man.

2410
01:41:42,270 --> 01:41:45,730
Like it's marketing,
but I don't know the science behind it.

2411
01:41:45,850 --> 01:41:46,850
Fucking weird.
I mean,

2412
01:41:46,960 --> 01:41:47,490
listen,
there's.

2413
01:41:47,680 --> 01:41:52,680
I mean there's something to be said 
about keeping muscles warm when you're 

2414
01:41:52,680 --> 01:41:52,680
working out,
when muscles get cold,

2415
01:41:52,680 --> 01:41:54,010
but is that what it does?
Lets lets google.

2416
01:41:54,130 --> 01:41:57,520
What are the benefits of compression 
clothes for athletics?

2417
01:41:57,521 --> 01:41:59,310
There's going to be some,
some compression.

2418
01:41:59,310 --> 01:42:02,550
A salesman that fucking hit us up and 
just give rights to nine.

2419
01:42:02,590 --> 01:42:07,590
Our paragraph.
I started to shake for compression 

2420
01:42:08,051 --> 01:42:09,520
socks,
ties quick,

2421
01:42:09,580 --> 01:42:14,580
properly designed and fitted compression
like we're prevent venous blood pooling 

2422
01:42:14,580 --> 01:42:16,840
in the legs and improve leg symptoms and
decrease the risk of blood clots.

2423
01:42:17,910 --> 01:42:22,910
Yeah,
but there's so much blood flow when 

2424
01:42:22,910 --> 01:42:22,910
you're working out.
I,

2425
01:42:22,910 --> 01:42:22,910
I highly doubt there's a lot of pooling 
and athletes.

2426
01:42:22,910 --> 01:42:25,390
One of the things that I saw when I was 
in Thailand where they had stores,

2427
01:42:25,470 --> 01:42:26,500
stores,
stores,

2428
01:42:26,920 --> 01:42:31,920
stores that were was all compression 
clothing including face masks and 

2429
01:42:32,681 --> 01:42:33,490
gloves.
It's just a.

2430
01:42:33,540 --> 01:42:35,880
that's just like a leather daddy suit 
with that was like.

2431
01:42:35,890 --> 01:42:39,430
It was tan skin card.
It was fucking strange,

2432
01:42:39,431 --> 01:42:39,950
man.
Weird.

2433
01:42:40,030 --> 01:42:41,260
We're outside the store.
I was like,

2434
01:42:41,261 --> 01:42:44,380
what is this?
What is this?

2435
01:42:44,410 --> 01:42:46,780
Oppression shops through.
They had it for little kids.

2436
01:42:47,170 --> 01:42:48,850
No little masks.

2437
01:42:49,020 --> 01:42:54,020
A little kid.
Now you're getting into a weird 

2438
01:42:54,020 --> 01:42:54,020
territory,
little pants,

2439
01:42:54,020 --> 01:42:54,220
little masks,
little shirts.

2440
01:42:54,420 --> 01:42:56,140
It was real strange shit.
That shit is gross.

2441
01:42:56,150 --> 01:42:57,720
Then you get into a territory of 
something pervy.

2442
01:42:58,060 --> 01:42:59,740
I think it's people that eat too many 
noodles.

2443
01:43:00,040 --> 01:43:03,940
You just eat all those carbs.
He's just fed down.

2444
01:43:04,050 --> 01:43:05,090
See,
I know people that travel.

2445
01:43:05,091 --> 01:43:10,091
My Dad used to work with this guy and he
would travel a lot and he always wore 

2446
01:43:10,091 --> 01:43:10,091
compression.
He was a bigger dude.

2447
01:43:10,091 --> 01:43:14,580
He wore compression sleeves and socks 
and stuff on planes because traveling a 

2448
01:43:14,580 --> 01:43:14,580
lot.
That's why that piece.

2449
01:43:14,580 --> 01:43:19,291
Some people like it for that.
I think some people use compression 

2450
01:43:19,291 --> 01:43:21,421
socks when they travel up there on 
planes all the time because you do pool 

2451
01:43:21,421 --> 01:43:21,421
and clot on planes.
Yeah.

2452
01:43:21,421 --> 01:43:25,470
It happens to people all the time.
You Pool and clot blood can pool on 

2453
01:43:25,470 --> 01:43:25,470
planes very easily.

2454
01:43:25,470 --> 01:43:26,800
Don't you need to just go to the gym?
You Lazy.

2455
01:43:26,801 --> 01:43:31,801
Fuck fact.
God damn fact fucking compression 

2456
01:43:31,801 --> 01:43:31,801
shorts.
It's not going to fix it.

2457
01:43:31,810 --> 01:43:32,980
That's just wrong with your body,
bro.

2458
01:43:32,981 --> 01:43:34,420
It's pooled and pooling.
They could.

2459
01:43:34,421 --> 01:43:38,290
You just sunk in the seat.
You're gelatinous membrane.

2460
01:43:38,291 --> 01:43:39,070
Would you like it?
If they,

2461
01:43:39,310 --> 01:43:44,310
if they,
if they had an airline that you could 

2462
01:43:44,310 --> 01:43:44,980
work out on the fly and play a pay a 
premium and had a gym in the back of the

2463
01:43:44,981 --> 01:43:46,980
plane,
like on a commercial jet,

2464
01:43:47,800 --> 01:43:52,800
dickheads doing cleans and he drops the 
bar and it goes right through the be 

2465
01:43:52,800 --> 01:43:52,800
fucking hilarious.

2466
01:43:52,800 --> 01:43:54,440
Kids start getting sucked through the 
list.

2467
01:43:54,480 --> 01:43:57,470
All your own risk and you're in the 
middle of the perfect bit.

2468
01:43:57,471 --> 01:43:59,420
You're writing and you're like,
yes,

2469
01:43:59,650 --> 01:44:04,650
I got it.
You clap your hands together and you'd 

2470
01:44:04,650 --> 01:44:06,641
show your lab.
Cop goes flying through the whole floor 

2471
01:44:06,641 --> 01:44:10,020
because some dickhead wants to do is 
cross fit workout on the crossfit gym in

2472
01:44:11,421 --> 01:44:13,100
the sky.
You couldn't,

2473
01:44:13,120 --> 01:44:14,960
um,
couldn't lift weights there,

2474
01:44:14,961 --> 01:44:16,580
but maybe you can have machines.
Yeah,

2475
01:44:16,581 --> 01:44:21,581
that'd be a cool machine.
You could do or presented those 

2476
01:44:21,581 --> 01:44:21,581
resistance bands.
Machines.

2477
01:44:21,581 --> 01:44:22,090
Those was like a cable cable machines,
right?

2478
01:44:22,260 --> 01:44:24,560
Those three 60 machines.
What does this,

2479
01:44:24,561 --> 01:44:26,540
Jamie.
It's on its way.

2480
01:44:26,870 --> 01:44:31,130
What's Santina knows ahead of the curve 
ahead of the modular modular planes.

2481
01:44:31,131 --> 01:44:36,131
I think that they've sort of the fuck 
out of here in the flight exercise 

2482
01:44:36,131 --> 01:44:36,131
project.
Hold on,

2483
01:44:36,131 --> 01:44:38,330
let's go up.
So we could read that inflight exercise.

2484
01:44:38,600 --> 01:44:41,480
Your next flight abroad could include a 
Jim.

2485
01:44:41,510 --> 01:44:42,950
When's this article published?
May,

2486
01:44:42,980 --> 01:44:47,980
may pose an Airbus project.
Is displaying a prototype flying jim 

2487
01:44:48,381 --> 01:44:49,940
module,
the San Jose airport.

2488
01:44:50,180 --> 01:44:54,170
The modules can be used for spas,
napping pods or gaming center.

2489
01:44:54,171 --> 01:44:56,090
That's tight trans.
Stop,

2490
01:44:56,091 --> 01:44:57,050
stop,
stop scrolling.

2491
01:44:57,320 --> 01:45:02,320
Transpose isn't the first to suggest 
using cabin space for activities that 

2492
01:45:02,320 --> 01:45:04,070
promote wellness.
Although such ideas are intriguing.

2493
01:45:04,400 --> 01:45:09,400
A lot of these concepts don't really 
account for the business model of air 

2494
01:45:09,400 --> 01:45:12,611
travel.
Says Devin Lidl principle behind 

2495
01:45:12,611 --> 01:45:15,490
strategist of fatigue.
Yet he's what's called the fund stopper.

2496
01:45:16,610 --> 01:45:19,270
Devin,
you fucking fuck head.

2497
01:45:19,640 --> 01:45:21,220
What does that.
Those are sleep.

2498
01:45:21,230 --> 01:45:22,130
Oh,
that's like a,

2499
01:45:22,150 --> 01:45:23,780
um,
like rubber bands.

2500
01:45:23,781 --> 01:45:27,710
Like you do like yoga mats or something 
like that.

2501
01:45:29,150 --> 01:45:32,480
That's Kinda cool man.
See that seems reasonable,

2502
01:45:32,481 --> 01:45:37,481
but I feel like so few people are going 
to use it that it's going to be one of 

2503
01:45:37,481 --> 01:45:37,730
those things where after awhile it's 
just like,

2504
01:45:37,731 --> 01:45:42,731
hey,
remember when we used to have a smoking 

2505
01:45:42,731 --> 01:45:42,731
port at the back of the plane?
That's what's going to be like.

2506
01:45:42,731 --> 01:45:43,640
Remember that used to have a fucking.
Oh,

2507
01:45:43,670 --> 01:45:46,940
so these are the napping pods.
That shit's awesome.

2508
01:45:47,030 --> 01:45:52,030
When we were flying to Thailand,
there was this one dude that went to 

2509
01:45:52,030 --> 01:45:53,120
sleep immediately and he was an enormous
guy.

2510
01:45:53,900 --> 01:45:58,900
Andy,
who's the loudest I've ever heard in 

2511
01:45:58,900 --> 01:45:58,900
your life.

2512
01:46:01,140 --> 01:46:02,600
Wake the fuck up.
I go,

2513
01:46:02,601 --> 01:46:03,200
no.
Hey,

2514
01:46:03,380 --> 01:46:04,200
hey,
you're young.

2515
01:46:04,230 --> 01:46:05,240
You're fucking.
You're loud.

2516
01:46:05,260 --> 01:46:06,410
I'll wait cheap.
Allowed you wake them up.

2517
01:46:06,440 --> 01:46:07,280
I do it.
I've done it before.

2518
01:46:07,281 --> 01:46:08,390
I'm playing with you.
Say I go,

2519
01:46:08,391 --> 01:46:09,410
excuse me,
and they,

2520
01:46:09,970 --> 01:46:11,330
you're,
you're fucking,

2521
01:46:11,390 --> 01:46:16,390
you're snoring.
Just want to let you know you're 

2522
01:46:16,390 --> 01:46:16,390
snoring.
And they give me.

2523
01:46:16,390 --> 01:46:16,390
They give you like a fuck.
You look,

2524
01:46:16,390 --> 01:46:19,751
but it's fuck them.
I don't want to sit there while the 

2525
01:46:19,751 --> 01:46:20,480
plane is quite here.
You having fucking apnea.

2526
01:46:20,481 --> 01:46:21,540
I don't need to hear it.
Yeah,

2527
01:46:21,550 --> 01:46:22,430
it was bad.
Yeah,

2528
01:46:22,431 --> 01:46:23,810
it's fucking gross.
Went,

2529
01:46:23,990 --> 01:46:28,990
went on for hours.
See people covering their head with 

2530
01:46:28,990 --> 01:46:28,990
pillow.
How long is that flight?

2531
01:46:28,990 --> 01:46:30,350
Fifteen hours.
Twelve hours.

2532
01:46:30,410 --> 01:46:32,360
Thirteen hours to Taipei.
Fuck.

2533
01:46:32,361 --> 01:46:34,430
That shit was gray.
Rome.

2534
01:46:34,550 --> 01:46:37,220
Rome from here is 14.
One fifth,

2535
01:46:37,230 --> 01:46:38,510
something like that.
Yeah.

2536
01:46:38,511 --> 01:46:43,160
So no mother fucking listening to think 
about.

2537
01:46:43,370 --> 01:46:46,040
Think about that.
They put a gym on there for a premium.

2538
01:46:46,800 --> 01:46:49,430
People might pay man for long flights 
and not in that,

2539
01:46:49,440 --> 01:46:49,830
not

2540
01:46:50,070 --> 01:46:51,780
in the US,
but overseas flights.

2541
01:46:51,781 --> 01:46:52,560
People might be like,
man,

2542
01:46:52,561 --> 01:46:54,070
I can fucking get a workout in before I 
land.

2543
01:46:54,090 --> 01:46:56,310
Take that snoring guy,
bring them back there and goes,

2544
01:46:56,330 --> 01:46:57,390
well,
you're still on a machine.

2545
01:46:58,040 --> 01:46:58,780
Yeah,
you fat.

2546
01:46:58,830 --> 01:47:02,250
Fuck you fucking heads to fat.
That's the sign that says p,

2547
01:47:02,340 --> 01:47:04,980
everyone pays fat.
Fat,

2548
01:47:04,981 --> 01:47:05,600
head,
fun.

2549
01:47:06,640 --> 01:47:11,640
Workout for free.
I want to know like what?

2550
01:47:12,180 --> 01:47:14,730
When did people start getting fat?
Fat?

2551
01:47:15,920 --> 01:47:16,310
Well,
I'm,

2552
01:47:16,440 --> 01:47:21,440
I mean,
I mean that sugar documentary claims 

2553
01:47:21,440 --> 01:47:21,870
that it's in the revolution of corn 
syrups.

2554
01:47:21,871 --> 01:47:24,660
Introduction into the fucking.
I would like to know though,

2555
01:47:24,990 --> 01:47:26,880
like when people,
when the transition,

2556
01:47:27,110 --> 01:47:31,140
what was a rare person like way back in 
the day they got that fat,

2557
01:47:31,200 --> 01:47:33,540
like what do you think?
Like the six sixties in the seventies,

2558
01:47:33,541 --> 01:47:36,210
things started to change.
I don't know.

2559
01:47:36,330 --> 01:47:41,330
I imagine when our technology boom 
happened in the eighties as probably 

2560
01:47:41,330 --> 01:47:41,330
when it all started.

2561
01:47:41,330 --> 01:47:45,980
Well it happened before that for sure,
but it was also like sugary cereals and 

2562
01:47:45,980 --> 01:47:46,020
stuff.
Right?

2563
01:47:46,021 --> 01:47:47,430
And doesn't that stuff introducing the 
eighties,

2564
01:47:47,570 --> 01:47:50,610
seventies were like that.
That was the end of like natural cereal?

2565
01:47:50,670 --> 01:47:55,670
No,
they had those sugary cereals in the 

2566
01:47:55,670 --> 01:47:55,670
seventies for sure because I was a 
little kid,

2567
01:47:55,670 --> 01:47:56,700
a little kid in the seventies where they
like they are today.

2568
01:47:57,120 --> 01:47:58,500
Oh yeah.
Cocoa puffs in like.

2569
01:47:59,010 --> 01:48:04,010
But I mean the amount of hunger,
I wonder what it is comparatively 

2570
01:48:04,010 --> 01:48:06,411
because.
Because now it's like 40 grams of 

2571
01:48:06,411 --> 01:48:06,411
fucking cup.
It's,

2572
01:48:06,411 --> 01:48:06,411
it's absurd.
I think it was the same.

2573
01:48:06,411 --> 01:48:11,120
He do.
But then do you think it's because they 

2574
01:48:11,120 --> 01:48:11,120
were using cane sugar then?
In different times?

2575
01:48:11,120 --> 01:48:13,590
I think people got fat even back then.
But I think it's expanded.

2576
01:48:13,860 --> 01:48:15,840
It's expanded to everything.
Well,

2577
01:48:15,841 --> 01:48:18,720
convenience to write those.
You can get any fast food everywhere all

2578
01:48:18,721 --> 01:48:19,050
the time.

2579
01:48:19,530 --> 01:48:21,330
Twenty four hours is brilliant.
It doesn't.

2580
01:48:21,331 --> 01:48:23,130
Mcdonald's really put sugar in their 
fries.

2581
01:48:23,520 --> 01:48:23,910
Yeah,
man.

2582
01:48:23,911 --> 01:48:25,980
They put them in their fucking buns.
They put in everything.

2583
01:48:26,130 --> 01:48:29,160
Sugar's in everything and everything.
They make their buttons.

2584
01:48:29,190 --> 01:48:31,520
The buttons have sugar in them.
They add sugar to the bottle.

2585
01:48:31,530 --> 01:48:32,730
Yeah.
Wow.

2586
01:48:33,570 --> 01:48:34,860
Dextrose?
It's dextrose.

2587
01:48:35,220 --> 01:48:36,300
Sugar,
sugar.

2588
01:48:36,330 --> 01:48:41,330
Howard taft.
The president was 340 pounds and that 

2589
01:48:41,330 --> 01:48:41,330
was a long time ago.
Three 40.

2590
01:48:41,950 --> 01:48:46,950
How tall was.
He was trying to look up more 

2591
01:48:46,950 --> 01:48:46,950
information on that,
but it was all come,

2592
01:48:46,950 --> 01:48:51,620
just loved come.
He just drank a gallon of come.

2593
01:48:52,810 --> 01:48:55,140
I'm ready to address the state of the 
union,

2594
01:48:55,150 --> 01:49:00,150
but first I need my kids,
you know,

2595
01:49:01,830 --> 01:49:03,180
task.
There's a big juggernaut.

2596
01:49:03,630 --> 01:49:08,220
That was this thing.
My fellow Americans burp Kennedy.

2597
01:49:08,221 --> 01:49:09,810
Same thing.
Kennedy was a little,

2598
01:49:09,870 --> 01:49:11,300
little,
little teacups.

2599
01:49:11,580 --> 01:49:13,530
Kennedy apparently was on all sorts of 
drugs,

2600
01:49:13,531 --> 01:49:16,740
including crystal Meth,
the meth them up.

2601
01:49:16,920 --> 01:49:18,140
He was a,
he was in a meth.

2602
01:49:18,360 --> 01:49:19,950
Yeah.
Yeah.

2603
01:49:19,980 --> 01:49:24,730
Kennedy apparently had some serious 
physical ailments and um,

2604
01:49:24,810 --> 01:49:27,510
he was in dire straights.
Is that true?

2605
01:49:27,540 --> 01:49:29,910
He was a big pill head who's in massive 
pain.

2606
01:49:30,450 --> 01:49:32,520
They said that in the,
like,

2607
01:49:32,521 --> 01:49:35,910
it's like if he didn't get assassinated,
he would've never done two terms.

2608
01:49:35,911 --> 01:49:39,360
He would have been dead just from 
whatever the fuck was going on was going

2609
01:49:39,361 --> 01:49:40,250
on with them.
Yeah.

2610
01:49:41,400 --> 01:49:45,670
He had some serious back problems and so
he was such a young fit guy.

2611
01:49:46,530 --> 01:49:47,860
Like he didn't look,
he didn't look.

2612
01:49:48,400 --> 01:49:50,350
He looked in shape.
Not really.

2613
01:49:50,770 --> 01:49:53,100
He looked young,
but compared to most presidents,

2614
01:49:53,130 --> 01:49:53,950
anything.
He looked in shape.

2615
01:49:54,310 --> 01:49:56,740
Here's a picture of taft.
Look at that fat.

2616
01:49:56,741 --> 01:49:58,830
Fuck that Walrus.
Looking at motherfucker.

2617
01:49:58,870 --> 01:50:02,020
What year was this?
Nineteen.

2618
01:50:02,920 --> 01:50:04,450
He's got.
He's got food in that hat.

2619
01:50:04,451 --> 01:50:05,440
Maybe 19,
19,

2620
01:50:05,441 --> 01:50:06,200
but I can't say.

2621
01:50:06,230 --> 01:50:07,720
Well,
I bet it's booze,

2622
01:50:08,020 --> 01:50:08,930
right?
He was solid.

2623
01:50:09,910 --> 01:50:12,910
Serious booze.
That's so big.

2624
01:50:13,540 --> 01:50:15,520
That's crazy.
How big he was so easy.

2625
01:50:15,521 --> 01:50:20,521
Our fattest president,
who's our skinny as President Lincoln,

2626
01:50:20,650 --> 01:50:21,940
that tall,
skinny motherfucker.

2627
01:50:22,010 --> 01:50:25,150
Lincoln's pretty God damn skinny.
He was a rail wirey.

2628
01:50:26,270 --> 01:50:28,270
How would that look?
Three 40.

2629
01:50:28,271 --> 01:50:30,460
That's what's funny.
Those pictures make him look to $50.

2630
01:50:30,500 --> 01:50:32,170
I was gonna show you this one.
Photoshop,

2631
01:50:32,800 --> 01:50:34,780
Photoshop,
and in 1929.

2632
01:50:34,840 --> 01:50:36,850
This is White House portrait.
Oh yeah.

2633
01:50:36,851 --> 01:50:38,560
They skinned him.
Skinning him up for that.

2634
01:50:38,830 --> 01:50:43,830
Yeah,
they did the trim them up a little bit 

2635
01:50:43,830 --> 01:50:44,650
because it's a portrait.
Because they made that chair look big.

2636
01:50:45,530 --> 01:50:46,900
It was smart.
Move on.

2637
01:50:46,901 --> 01:50:47,830
The artists.
Yeah.

2638
01:50:47,920 --> 01:50:52,920
They shrunk them up a little bit there 
and make them look a little bit more 

2639
01:50:52,920 --> 01:50:55,771
regal.
Like Obama may have been one of our 

2640
01:50:55,771 --> 01:50:55,771
skinny.
He was skinny as shit.

2641
01:50:55,771 --> 01:50:56,920
He was fit even though he smoked 
cigarettes.

2642
01:50:57,160 --> 01:51:01,080
George Bush,
I guess was our most recent Bush was was

2643
01:51:01,140 --> 01:51:03,490
not out of shape.
He wasn't just a big.

2644
01:51:03,520 --> 01:51:05,800
He wasn't a big guy.
Reagan was thin for an old guy.

2645
01:51:05,890 --> 01:51:07,810
He's saying he was like in the 
seventies,

2646
01:51:08,860 --> 01:51:10,780
right?
James Madison was five,

2647
01:51:10,781 --> 01:51:13,510
four and 100 pounds.
Damn.

2648
01:51:13,511 --> 01:51:18,511
Not even a real guy for $100.
That's not even a real guy.

2649
01:51:22,690 --> 01:51:24,730
That's a fake number.
What year was that?

2650
01:51:26,200 --> 01:51:27,580
James Madison.
Boy.

2651
01:51:27,581 --> 01:51:32,320
That's tiny.
Five for a 100 pound or pound grown man.

2652
01:51:32,740 --> 01:51:34,180
What did he eat?
Presidential term?

2653
01:51:34,181 --> 01:51:34,520
18.
Oh,

2654
01:51:34,521 --> 01:51:37,480
nine slash 18 slash 17 people back then.
Didn't have any food.

2655
01:51:37,510 --> 01:51:39,010
I think the average height person 
probably five,

2656
01:51:39,011 --> 01:51:39,430
five,
five,

2657
01:51:39,440 --> 01:51:44,440
six.
When they were always just dodge and 

2658
01:51:44,440 --> 01:51:44,620
Indians.
If you were a smaller,

2659
01:51:44,621 --> 01:51:46,750
the arrows that go over your head.
If we didn't have to duck,

2660
01:51:46,751 --> 01:51:47,530
you can just stand there.

2661
01:51:50,060 --> 01:51:52,630
Well,
what do you think?

2662
01:51:52,860 --> 01:51:54,430
That's not funny though.
I bet you if you.

2663
01:51:54,431 --> 01:51:56,950
If you had a sliding scale of the height
of the presidents,

2664
01:51:58,840 --> 01:52:02,110
but there was a thing about the civil 
war where they said that,

2665
01:52:02,111 --> 01:52:07,111
uh,
the average soldier in the civil war 

2666
01:52:07,111 --> 01:52:07,490
weighed 125 pounds because they were 
like 17,

2667
01:52:07,500 --> 01:52:09,580
16,
17 years since they were kids.

2668
01:52:10,030 --> 01:52:11,890
Right.
Most of the soldiers were like children.

2669
01:52:12,040 --> 01:52:12,910
Yeah,
I'm sure.

2670
01:52:12,911 --> 01:52:14,950
Well,
most of the soldiers today or young,

2671
01:52:14,951 --> 01:52:16,930
same thing,
we use 18 as a standard,

2672
01:52:16,931 --> 01:52:18,520
but back in the day there wasn't a 
fucking number.

2673
01:52:19,030 --> 01:52:20,470
Wow.
Wonder what the number was?

2674
01:52:20,830 --> 01:52:25,000
Google the average size of a soldier in 
the civil war.

2675
01:52:25,001 --> 01:52:28,030
I'm pretty sure it was 125 pounds,
you know,

2676
01:52:28,031 --> 01:52:32,380
that I have are so tiny.
I got a picture out there of Sinatra.

2677
01:52:32,510 --> 01:52:34,780
His mugshot.
You weighed 125 pounds.

2678
01:52:34,781 --> 01:52:35,140
Yeah,
he was.

2679
01:52:35,141 --> 01:52:36,160
He was a skinny,
tiny,

2680
01:52:36,410 --> 01:52:37,270
tiny,
tiny dude.

2681
01:52:37,270 --> 01:52:38,470
Five eight.
One 43.

2682
01:52:38,930 --> 01:52:41,140
The average.
I look up the Ed.

2683
01:52:41,141 --> 01:52:42,500
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

2684
01:52:42,730 --> 01:52:44,810
I spoke to quick.
This was a no.

2685
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:46,520
Yeah,
civil war.

2686
01:52:46,580 --> 01:52:49,910
An average civil war soldier was white,
native born farmer,

2687
01:52:49,911 --> 01:52:53,050
Protestants single between 18 and 29 and
he stood about five,

2688
01:52:53,070 --> 01:52:54,350
eight,
1:43.

2689
01:52:54,620 --> 01:52:55,690
That's weird.
One of the.

2690
01:52:55,750 --> 01:52:58,250
It was smaller than that.
That also sounds very under 43.

2691
01:52:58,251 --> 01:53:02,840
Seems like a reasonable size for that 
time when there's no food,

2692
01:53:03,140 --> 01:53:08,140
but you're also talking about it.
There wasn't this like how could they 

2693
01:53:08,140 --> 01:53:10,451
have been that organized?
I'm sure people were just fighting who 

2694
01:53:10,451 --> 01:53:12,210
were around.
I'm sure people just join the ranks and 

2695
01:53:12,210 --> 01:53:12,210
they weren't like,
you got to go through the process.

2696
01:53:12,210 --> 01:53:12,210
They were like,
here's a gun.

2697
01:53:12,210 --> 01:53:16,511
Go fucking kill somebody.
Do you think they didn't measure their 

2698
01:53:16,511 --> 01:53:16,511
size?
I think they've.

2699
01:53:16,511 --> 01:53:16,940
I think they took anything they could 
get.

2700
01:53:17,090 --> 01:53:17,990
I think they were like,
fuck this.

2701
01:53:17,991 --> 01:53:20,600
We need everyone we can get.
Especially in the south,

2702
01:53:20,630 --> 01:53:21,290
Metro,
southwest,

2703
01:53:21,440 --> 01:53:24,140
the southwest.
Just all against be.

2704
01:53:24,260 --> 01:53:26,690
Everybody wanted to join in the south 
and the north people were like,

2705
01:53:26,960 --> 01:53:31,960
alright,
I guess we'll fuck you guys up if we 

2706
01:53:31,960 --> 01:53:33,371
have two soldiers was 12 told you?
Look at the little drummer boy,

2707
01:53:36,711 --> 01:53:40,650
common age was 19.
Holy Shit old.

2708
01:53:40,651 --> 01:53:43,880
His age was 80.
You imagine you're 80 and you're.

2709
01:53:43,960 --> 01:53:45,860
You're in Gettysburg.
What are you doing,

2710
01:53:45,861 --> 01:53:49,340
man?
Just go sit down fucking 80.

2711
01:53:49,370 --> 01:53:50,780
You have to fight,
man.

2712
01:53:50,781 --> 01:53:55,781
You want to keep that stupid flag flying
to the fact that they still bitch about 

2713
01:53:55,781 --> 01:54:00,641
it.
Did you watch fucking Sasha Baron cones 

2714
01:54:00,641 --> 01:54:02,490
thing it.
It's a holy shit of him getting this 

2715
01:54:02,490 --> 01:54:05,981
Georgia.
This is Georgia state representative to 

2716
01:54:05,981 --> 01:54:07,760
be like fucking huck and the n word out 
like 10 times saying why did he say it?

2717
01:54:07,760 --> 01:54:09,420
What was the,
cause you know it.

2718
01:54:09,430 --> 01:54:12,560
Sasha.
Sasha finagles him into doing these fake

2719
01:54:12,561 --> 01:54:17,561
psa ads or whatever of like 
antiterrorism shit without be given.

2720
01:54:18,410 --> 01:54:20,030
I don't want to give away Stacie's 
Oscars.

2721
01:54:20,090 --> 01:54:22,010
One of the head writers over there,
he was telling me he was,

2722
01:54:22,100 --> 01:54:22,820
he was,
he was.

2723
01:54:22,850 --> 01:54:24,810
He says it gets crazier.
Oh Dude.

2724
01:54:24,860 --> 01:54:27,200
You could tell it that you could tell 
them just tipping you.

2725
01:54:27,230 --> 01:54:27,740
They're like,
man,

2726
01:54:27,741 --> 01:54:31,280
here's a little something for you.
It gets really crazy at the last episode

2727
01:54:31,520 --> 01:54:32,490
from this.
This care.

2728
01:54:32,530 --> 01:54:33,920
The one character that's like,
uh,

2729
01:54:33,921 --> 01:54:35,090
the Israeli guy.
Yeah.

2730
01:54:35,110 --> 01:54:36,570
Too fucking good.
As I care.

2731
01:54:36,580 --> 01:54:41,580
It's great.
Pull up a video of that character when 

2732
01:54:41,580 --> 01:54:45,190
he was talking the a second amendment 
guy like making like cute guns for kids.

2733
01:54:48,320 --> 01:54:50,270
They do.
They do ads for guns,

2734
01:54:51,970 --> 01:54:56,970
but the character is so crazy.
This is the most sugar is the Israeli 

2735
01:54:57,201 --> 01:54:57,570
commandment.

2736
01:54:57,600 --> 01:55:01,400
And tell the kid that have safety gun 
and it's got big,

2737
01:55:01,670 --> 01:55:06,670
big plush doll on top.
They put like little plush towels on 

2738
01:55:06,670 --> 01:55:06,670
kids,
guns and shit.

2739
01:55:06,670 --> 01:55:06,670
Pull his mouth.
Eat,

2740
01:55:06,670 --> 01:55:11,230
shoot gun.
Apparently they like those really 

2741
01:55:11,230 --> 01:55:13,790
hardcore Christian Second Amendment 
cause they love Israelis of course.

2742
01:55:14,050 --> 01:55:16,240
So they love Israeli soldiers.
Man.

2743
01:55:16,640 --> 01:55:19,340
This is why he decided to have.
This is really character.

2744
01:55:19,610 --> 01:55:22,610
This dude is hilarious.
Gop lawmakers who enjoys giving,

2745
01:55:22,820 --> 01:55:23,990
endorse,
giving three-year-olds,

2746
01:55:23,991 --> 01:55:25,490
guns,
stuffed animal.

2747
01:55:25,520 --> 01:55:27,780
The stuffed animals surrounds the gun.
You're not gonna.

2748
01:55:27,790 --> 01:55:32,790
See any day,
but see if you can get a video of him 

2749
01:55:32,790 --> 01:55:32,790
doing the character.
Yeah,

2750
01:55:32,790 --> 01:55:36,170
see click.
That's just going to be the full 

2751
01:55:36,170 --> 01:55:36,170
trailer.
They won't show you,

2752
01:55:36,170 --> 01:55:36,170
but play it.
Play it,

2753
01:55:36,170 --> 01:55:36,170
play it,
play it.

2754
01:55:36,380 --> 01:55:37,010
No,
that's it.

2755
01:55:37,070 --> 01:55:42,070
That's it.
My next guest is a gun rights advocate 

2756
01:55:42,811 --> 01:55:44,270
and he the bushmaster semiology

2757
01:55:44,280 --> 01:55:49,280
rifle.
The type of rifle Adam Lanza used to 

2758
01:55:49,280 --> 01:55:51,801
killed 20 children and six mile ride is 
quite a blast to shoot with tons of fun.

2759
01:55:52,650 --> 01:55:54,630
Some of them are much more cool than 
others.

2760
01:55:55,020 --> 01:55:59,390
Are you proud of what you said?
It's just a fact.

2761
01:55:59,420 --> 01:56:04,420
In America there have been a lot of 
shootings in the school and into 

2762
01:56:04,420 --> 01:56:08,520
university.
What do the liberal say is the solution?

2763
01:56:10,820 --> 01:56:15,820
Well,
they blame it on guns because the guns.

2764
01:56:16,310 --> 01:56:19,120
Yes,
we've got sugar.

2765
01:56:19,190 --> 01:56:24,190
It is.
We started a program in Israel for 

2766
01:56:24,190 --> 01:56:26,450
kindle guardians.
Okay.

2767
01:56:26,600 --> 01:56:30,500
We train them from the age 16 down to 
the age three.

2768
01:56:30,740 --> 01:56:31,600
Yeah.
Well I.

2769
01:56:31,601 --> 01:56:36,601
I think it would be a good idea.
We'd been pushing something along this 

2770
01:56:36,601 --> 01:56:40,841
line for years,
but really haven't gotten any traction 

2771
01:56:40,841 --> 01:56:43,571
with it.
We were thinking seventh or eighth 

2772
01:56:43,571 --> 01:56:43,571
grade.
You're talking much younger than that.

2773
01:56:43,571 --> 01:56:48,020
My son was in the very first program.
May he rest in peace night doing what I 

2774
01:56:50,281 --> 01:56:50,730
love.

2775
01:56:52,700 --> 01:56:57,700
Quite developed a conscious where you 
you feel guilty about doing something 

2776
01:56:57,951 --> 01:57:00,590
wrong that's developing that you're 
learning right and wrong.

2777
01:57:00,680 --> 01:57:02,150
If they don't,
haven't developed that yet.

2778
01:57:02,151 --> 01:57:07,151
They could be very effective soldiers.
This year in our state government,

2779
01:57:08,090 --> 01:57:13,090
they had a bill put in that would have 
made it illegal for someone four years 

2780
01:57:13,551 --> 01:57:16,970
old to 12 years old and have access to a
gun.

2781
01:57:17,340 --> 01:57:17,920
Uh,
we,

2782
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:19,910
we killed it.
We killed the bill.

2783
01:57:20,230 --> 01:57:25,230
They tried to stop.
Four year old children benefit from 

2784
01:57:25,230 --> 01:57:25,870
having access to guns.
Yes.

2785
01:57:26,230 --> 01:57:28,840
Yes.
What is the logic that these people come

2786
01:57:28,841 --> 01:57:33,841
up with?
May just think that children can't 

2787
01:57:33,841 --> 01:57:37,771
handle them.
We want players who are really experts 

2788
01:57:37,771 --> 01:57:41,191
at what they doing not play.
Also a checklist and we don't teach 

2789
01:57:41,191 --> 01:57:45,290
toilets because they call it the 
terrible twos for me.

2790
01:57:47,290 --> 01:57:50,730
Do Instructional video to show you?
Yeah,

2791
01:57:50,880 --> 01:57:55,880
well you should folks watch that.
But what's really crazy is the makeup 

2792
01:57:55,880 --> 01:58:00,381
man.
Let's look at the makeup that he's 

2793
01:58:00,381 --> 01:58:00,381
wearing.
He does one where he's like a,

2794
01:58:00,381 --> 01:58:02,250
an NPR type of cat and he goes to 
Kingman,

2795
01:58:02,251 --> 01:58:05,330
Arizona and he tries to build a mosque 
and they,

2796
01:58:05,750 --> 01:58:08,960
the initiative that comes out of their 
mouth off on it.

2797
01:58:09,090 --> 01:58:14,090
The one dude goes,
there's blacks in this town and we 

2798
01:58:14,090 --> 01:58:14,090
don't.
They don't belong here either.

2799
01:58:14,090 --> 01:58:15,080
And the guys.
And of course he's,

2800
01:58:15,140 --> 01:58:16,380
he makes a joke and then he goes,
no,

2801
01:58:16,381 --> 01:58:19,050
what I'm telling you is we tolerate 
them.

2802
01:58:19,440 --> 01:58:24,440
We tolerate the blacks.
It like sit and it sits in the room for 

2803
01:58:24,440 --> 01:58:24,440
a second.
You're like,

2804
01:58:24,440 --> 01:58:28,761
good fucking God.
These are real people that exist there 

2805
01:58:28,761 --> 01:58:28,930
exist.
Take tolerate the blacks.

2806
01:58:29,010 --> 01:58:30,690
Great.
Great name of his show too.

2807
01:58:30,691 --> 01:58:32,070
This is America.
Yeah,

2808
01:58:32,071 --> 01:58:37,071
this is it.
This is the guy from new mosque per 

2809
01:58:37,071 --> 01:58:37,110
gigabit,
Mpr guy with the wooden beads around his

2810
01:58:37,111 --> 01:58:38,360
neck.
He nailed it.

2811
01:58:38,400 --> 01:58:43,400
His intro was hilarious because he goes,
I'm a self hating white man plays at 

2812
01:58:43,400 --> 01:58:45,030
play that video.
Try to find that video.

2813
01:58:45,060 --> 01:58:46,850
It's really fucking funny.
And then you.

2814
01:58:47,060 --> 01:58:48,310
And he's a genius.
He,

2815
01:58:48,340 --> 01:58:49,090
he,
uh,

2816
01:58:49,870 --> 01:58:51,280
he lays us.
What is this,

2817
01:58:51,890 --> 01:58:52,500
this,
this,

2818
01:58:53,110 --> 01:58:53,270
this

2819
01:58:54,350 --> 01:58:59,350
huge economic growth here.
Wants to see an investment of 

2820
01:59:04,070 --> 01:59:09,070
$385,000,000.
Guess what?

2821
01:59:12,440 --> 01:59:17,440
You guys are going to get it here to 
tell you chosen as the location of a 

2822
01:59:20,991 --> 01:59:25,280
brand.
You state of the art mosque.

2823
01:59:30,700 --> 01:59:32,180
I know some of you are thinking,
okay,

2824
01:59:32,181 --> 01:59:37,181
this is just another typical mosque.
This guys is going to be the world's 

2825
01:59:39,920 --> 01:59:43,070
largest mosque outside of the Middle 
East.

2826
01:59:48,130 --> 01:59:50,730
The word alone scares you,
Jimmy.

2827
01:59:50,800 --> 01:59:52,480
When I hear the word mosque,
I think of terrorism.

2828
01:59:52,530 --> 01:59:55,060
This guy,
is there a need for this and kingman?

2829
01:59:55,090 --> 01:59:56,440
Yes,
there is.

2830
01:59:57,760 --> 02:00:01,140
Your town will become for the whole 
thing for tourism,

2831
02:00:04,870 --> 02:00:09,650
but the character,
the character is this guy right there.

2832
02:00:09,920 --> 02:00:14,920
That guy that.
The toothless dude that was just on him 

2833
02:00:14,920 --> 02:00:14,920
too,
but the other dude,

2834
02:00:14,920 --> 02:00:16,780
he's the one that's like the fucking 
blacks we tolerate.

2835
02:00:16,830 --> 02:00:17,950
It's a.
We have to.

2836
02:00:18,120 --> 02:00:20,890
We do it because we have to look at his 
shoes.

2837
02:00:20,950 --> 02:00:23,760
Ready fucking outfit.
This is amazing.

2838
02:00:23,860 --> 02:00:28,860
Every detail of every character he does 
the clothing is is some of the funniest 

2839
02:00:28,860 --> 02:00:28,860
shit.
It's real specific.

2840
02:00:28,860 --> 02:00:33,590
Hilarious is he kind of had to do this 
because everybody knew what he looked 

2841
02:00:33,590 --> 02:00:37,471
like.
He could just do just do Ali g except 

2842
02:00:37,471 --> 02:00:37,780
for people in these.
You don't want someone goes.

2843
02:00:37,780 --> 02:00:39,910
Someone will notice she's famous.
Not In those worlds.

2844
02:00:39,970 --> 02:00:40,900
They don't.
They.

2845
02:00:40,960 --> 02:00:43,360
If he'd had no makeup on,
no money in King Lewin who?

2846
02:00:43,370 --> 02:00:44,740
Sacha Baron Cohen is.
Do you know what I mean?

2847
02:00:44,780 --> 02:00:47,950
The crazy thing is these people must.
Must've had to signed releases.

2848
02:00:48,120 --> 02:00:49,900
Yeah.
And I did hidden camera shit,

2849
02:00:49,901 --> 02:00:51,890
so I know how that works.
I've done that too.

2850
02:00:52,390 --> 02:00:53,800
How did they get us?
Two ways.

2851
02:00:53,860 --> 02:00:55,540
There's money,
which is always the best way.

2852
02:00:56,020 --> 02:00:57,870
And you make them sign before.
That's,

2853
02:00:57,880 --> 02:00:59,630
that's it.
There's two ways to get rewards the way.

2854
02:00:59,770 --> 02:01:00,730
Yeah.
You'd make them sign,

2855
02:01:00,940 --> 02:01:05,940
you know,
we're going to be featuring you on this 

2856
02:01:05,940 --> 02:01:05,940
thing.
We did this bit.

2857
02:01:05,940 --> 02:01:08,280
Ian Edwards and I did this bit for 
comedy central for the show that never 

2858
02:01:08,280 --> 02:01:08,280
went.
Um,

2859
02:01:08,280 --> 02:01:10,500
I don't know if I've ever told you this,
but we,

2860
02:01:10,510 --> 02:01:15,510
this bit was so fun to do.
We made a thing called Melanin Mayo 

2861
02:01:15,510 --> 02:01:16,240
Mayonnaise,
mayonnaise,

2862
02:01:16,241 --> 02:01:17,530
that,
that made you darker,

2863
02:01:21,250 --> 02:01:21,880
real shit.

2864
02:01:22,440 --> 02:01:27,280
And we put food coloring in Mayo,
but we introduced it as new Brown Mayo.

2865
02:01:27,580 --> 02:01:30,940
It's a new generation of Mayo.
And so we got people in this test group.

2866
02:01:31,120 --> 02:01:32,650
We know that real people in a real test 
group,

2867
02:01:32,651 --> 02:01:34,960
they go and take tests all the time and 
they emanate sample shit.

2868
02:01:35,440 --> 02:01:37,840
We put them in a room,
we made them eat the sandwiches,

2869
02:01:38,110 --> 02:01:40,370
just fucking mail is the eat the 
sandwiches,

2870
02:01:40,371 --> 02:01:43,040
all these white people eat the 
sandwiches and then when they're done,

2871
02:01:43,041 --> 02:01:46,520
we sent in this black dude al and she 
shows them a video and it was a pre tape

2872
02:01:46,521 --> 02:01:49,910
video basically of white people 
confessionals who have turned.

2873
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:50,540
We've,
you know,

2874
02:01:50,550 --> 02:01:55,550
we photoshop them to have turned more 
brown to start to turn black online and 

2875
02:01:55,550 --> 02:01:56,480
we're like in three to five weeks you 
start to see results.

2876
02:01:56,840 --> 02:01:59,390
You start to see cultural results,
mental results you're getting,

2877
02:01:59,600 --> 02:02:01,640
you're getting more black by culture,
you're getting smarter,

2878
02:02:01,641 --> 02:02:06,641
black,
you're getting cooler black and your 

2879
02:02:06,641 --> 02:02:06,641
neighborhood to your friends.

2880
02:02:06,641 --> 02:02:07,710
Like their faces.
Their faces were perfect.

2881
02:02:07,850 --> 02:02:09,560
If we didn't have any volume,
you'd have laughed.

2882
02:02:09,620 --> 02:02:12,650
Everyone's like,
wait a minute.

2883
02:02:12,680 --> 02:02:14,960
No one said we be black.
We'd be turning black.

2884
02:02:15,650 --> 02:02:17,290
I mean,
they lost their fucking minds.

2885
02:02:18,320 --> 02:02:20,300
People got so scared.
It was amazing.

2886
02:02:21,900 --> 02:02:23,600
That was incredible.
They MTV,

2887
02:02:24,230 --> 02:02:25,510
comedy central never aired to any of 
that.

2888
02:02:25,670 --> 02:02:27,890
Is it comedy central?
Probably hasn't fucking vault.

2889
02:02:27,891 --> 02:02:29,960
They throw away.
Oh my God.

2890
02:02:29,980 --> 02:02:34,980
Yeah.
That was one of our favorite bits that 

2891
02:02:34,980 --> 02:02:34,980
we,
that made us laugh so fucking hard.

2892
02:02:34,980 --> 02:02:36,860
They're faces.
One woman,

2893
02:02:37,100 --> 02:02:38,540
one woman to her credit,
she goes,

2894
02:02:38,790 --> 02:02:39,150
she,
you know,

2895
02:02:39,300 --> 02:02:44,300
people are freaking out and the route 
people started yelling at him and 

2896
02:02:44,300 --> 02:02:44,300
they're like,
this is,

2897
02:02:44,300 --> 02:02:44,330
I'm going to fucking show you.
I'm going to and he's black.

2898
02:02:44,331 --> 02:02:44,810
And he said,
Yep,

2899
02:02:44,811 --> 02:02:46,910
I'm going to fucking sue your ass if I'm
black.

2900
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:48,740
Kids like the flooding to watch him go.

2901
02:02:49,040 --> 02:02:50,570
It's not as bad as you're making it out 
to be.

2902
02:02:50,571 --> 02:02:51,050
I mean,
I was,

2903
02:02:51,150 --> 02:02:54,350
I was born black and I'm liking it a lot
and one woman goes,

2904
02:02:54,920 --> 02:02:59,920
you know,
it's disturbing because it's shocking 

2905
02:02:59,920 --> 02:02:59,920
just to spring this on me,
but I don't,

2906
02:02:59,920 --> 02:03:04,301
I'm,
I'm not scared I could take on being 

2907
02:03:04,301 --> 02:03:04,301
black.
I'll just,

2908
02:03:04,301 --> 02:03:04,301
let's,
let's,

2909
02:03:04,301 --> 02:03:04,301
we'll see what happens.
I mean,

2910
02:03:04,301 --> 02:03:06,770
she was like,
turn credit.

2911
02:03:07,600 --> 02:03:08,420
She goes,
we'll just,

2912
02:03:08,421 --> 02:03:10,220
I'll just live with.
We'll just figure this out.

2913
02:03:10,221 --> 02:03:11,000
I guess.
I mean,

2914
02:03:11,450 --> 02:03:14,510
it was insane that they bought into it,
but also that that's how we did it.

2915
02:03:14,540 --> 02:03:19,540
We fucking made him sign beforehand and 
then you paid them out and when it's 

2916
02:03:19,540 --> 02:03:22,811
over we broke them off more money so 
they wouldn't say no because they still 

2917
02:03:22,811 --> 02:03:23,470
have the legal right to be like,
I'm pulling that up.

2918
02:03:23,500 --> 02:03:24,710
You,
you pull it or I'm suing you.

2919
02:03:24,830 --> 02:03:29,830
So once it was over,
did they understand that it was for 

2920
02:03:29,830 --> 02:03:30,230
comedy central after,
after everything was said and done,

2921
02:03:30,290 --> 02:03:35,290
and then do they laugh?
A few did not laugh a few laps if you 

2922
02:03:36,150 --> 02:03:39,350
people are not,
but that was one of my favorite bits.

2923
02:03:39,890 --> 02:03:43,130
Melanin Mayo and man didn't work like a 
charm.

2924
02:03:43,400 --> 02:03:45,440
People were like,
this man needs is delicious.

2925
02:03:45,650 --> 02:03:48,740
It was fucking almonds or whatever with 
a little brown dye in it.

2926
02:03:49,370 --> 02:03:54,370
It's unconventional,
but I really like so stupid.

2927
02:03:54,590 --> 02:03:55,820
That's so funny.
Yeah,

2928
02:03:55,821 --> 02:03:56,810
that was a funny bit,
man.

2929
02:03:57,080 --> 02:03:58,460
They killed,
murdered a bit.

2930
02:03:58,640 --> 02:04:03,640
Seeing people think they're about to 
turn black and they panic and the black 

2931
02:04:03,640 --> 02:04:03,800
guys a presenter.
That was the best part.

2932
02:04:03,801 --> 02:04:04,800
We put our,
you know,

2933
02:04:04,850 --> 02:04:09,850
Al's up there and this guy named Al 
sheer is a great improv and he's in a 

2934
02:04:09,850 --> 02:04:14,561
room filled with fucking white people 
telling them they don't want to go 

2935
02:04:14,561 --> 02:04:14,561
black.

2936
02:04:14,561 --> 02:04:14,561
Oh my God.
It was awesome.

2937
02:04:14,990 --> 02:04:19,990
It was fun.
So he was saying that he used to be 

2938
02:04:19,990 --> 02:04:19,990
white.
No,

2939
02:04:19,990 --> 02:04:23,120
no,
he's saying he was the representative 

2940
02:04:23,120 --> 02:04:23,150
for the company.
We loved the idea.

2941
02:04:23,180 --> 02:04:28,180
We had images and video of people who 
had turned black white people who had 

2942
02:04:28,180 --> 02:04:33,041
turned black.
But you didn't tell him till after the 

2943
02:04:33,041 --> 02:04:33,041
eight.
That's exactly right.

2944
02:04:33,520 --> 02:04:35,690
The food first.
Then we showed them how we said it was a

2945
02:04:35,691 --> 02:04:38,370
commercial because that was whole thing 
is like a new commercial campaign for,

2946
02:04:38,550 --> 02:04:40,770
for whatever fake mayonnaise company we 
made up.

2947
02:04:41,070 --> 02:04:42,330
And then we had said,
here's the commercial,

2948
02:04:42,331 --> 02:04:44,160
we're going to run along with it.
What do you guys think?

2949
02:04:44,700 --> 02:04:49,700
And we played the course.
They were supposed to rate the 

2950
02:04:49,700 --> 02:04:51,051
commercial.
That's what they do in those test 

2951
02:04:51,051 --> 02:04:51,051
groups,
you know?

2952
02:04:51,051 --> 02:04:52,410
Oh my God.
Now what did comedy central?

2953
02:04:52,411 --> 02:04:53,280
Why did they not?

2954
02:04:53,550 --> 02:04:55,560
They did.
You know what's so funny is they,

2955
02:04:56,070 --> 02:05:01,070
they,
we overshot this pilot because I think 

2956
02:05:01,070 --> 02:05:02,200
they wanted way more bits for the sketch
show and I just don't.

2957
02:05:02,240 --> 02:05:03,630
They a lot of things they said they 
couldn't,

2958
02:05:03,631 --> 02:05:04,830
they didn't want to air,
they couldn't there.

2959
02:05:04,960 --> 02:05:08,160
There's a few things that were just,
he did some fucking great bits.

2960
02:05:08,161 --> 02:05:13,161
I just think comedy central legal 
department was just having trouble with 

2961
02:05:13,161 --> 02:05:13,161
it because he,
he was balls out.

2962
02:05:13,161 --> 02:05:17,060
He did this thing called gangster 
gardener where we went to bel air where 

2963
02:05:17,060 --> 02:05:20,331
he just started.
I'm like clipping people's lawns and 

2964
02:05:20,331 --> 02:05:20,331
planting trees with a group of Mexican 
dudes.

2965
02:05:20,331 --> 02:05:21,810
And they were like,
looked like there were thug the fuck out

2966
02:05:21,870 --> 02:05:23,100
and these white dudes would come out 
like,

2967
02:05:23,550 --> 02:05:24,810
what are you,
what are you doing in my yard?

2968
02:05:24,811 --> 02:05:29,811
So we planted trees.
Motherfucking we try to get this 

2969
02:05:29,811 --> 02:05:29,811
motherfucker looking nice and these 
white dudes are like,

2970
02:05:29,811 --> 02:05:29,811
no,
I don't want it.

2971
02:05:29,811 --> 02:05:30,330
He's like,
we landscaping.

2972
02:05:30,440 --> 02:05:32,490
And then he was,
he would hand them bills.

2973
02:05:32,491 --> 02:05:32,930
He'd be like,
yeah,

2974
02:05:32,940 --> 02:05:34,800
that's 50 bucks,
50 bucks would that Bush?

2975
02:05:34,950 --> 02:05:36,720
And these dudes were like,
I'm not giving you money.

2976
02:05:36,930 --> 02:05:39,320
You can't.
You can't just like renegade do my lawn.

2977
02:05:39,321 --> 02:05:44,321
He was like,
that's how we make money out here these 

2978
02:05:44,321 --> 02:05:44,321
days in bed layer.
It was like,

2979
02:05:44,321 --> 02:05:44,321
Ooh,
we got fucking.

2980
02:05:44,321 --> 02:05:46,110
That was a tough day because everyone's 
like,

2981
02:05:46,170 --> 02:05:51,170
I'm going to fuck it so you.
I'm going to sue every motherfucker in 

2982
02:05:51,170 --> 02:05:51,170
that truck.
I mean it was like.

2983
02:05:51,170 --> 02:05:55,670
I mean there were fun days but a lot of 
days and that shit was like going 

2984
02:05:55,670 --> 02:06:00,021
through.
You just feel people's anger bubbling 

2985
02:06:00,021 --> 02:06:00,021
over and they're going to murder 
somebody,

2986
02:06:00,021 --> 02:06:02,370
but al was ruthless.
He didn't give a fighting of a fuck.

2987
02:06:02,550 --> 02:06:04,180
You don't have to be a certain type of 
person.

2988
02:06:04,290 --> 02:06:05,490
He would go do any bit.

2989
02:06:05,520 --> 02:06:10,520
He would go to any bar he loved in 
racial shit was always his favorite was 

2990
02:06:10,520 --> 02:06:11,070
making white people feel uncomfortable 
to do a hidden camera show.

2991
02:06:11,071 --> 02:06:12,420
You've got to be a different kind of 
person.

2992
02:06:12,421 --> 02:06:13,440
Yeah.
It's a beastly thing.

2993
02:06:13,760 --> 02:06:18,720
I you to be a fucked up.
You gotta be fucked up and he and he was

2994
02:06:18,721 --> 02:06:19,860
fucking good.
But yeah,

2995
02:06:20,430 --> 02:06:25,430
Ian,
Ian and I and another person wrote a 

2996
02:06:25,430 --> 02:06:25,430
bunch of those.
Fucking weird stupid.

2997
02:06:26,110 --> 02:06:28,560
It's got to be really hard to do 
something like that today,

2998
02:06:28,680 --> 02:06:30,510
which is the interesting thing about the
Sarah,

2999
02:06:30,570 --> 02:06:31,740
Sarah,
Sarah,

3000
02:06:32,590 --> 02:06:34,740
Sacha Baron Cohen thing.
Oh yeah.

3001
02:06:34,741 --> 02:06:38,070
His head.
He like showtimes take some chances.

3002
02:06:38,410 --> 02:06:39,210
Yeah,
but you know what?

3003
02:06:39,480 --> 02:06:44,480
They took a chance because he is such a 
good horse to bet on and look at on 

3004
02:06:44,480 --> 02:06:44,790
that.
Just on your youtube clip.

3005
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:48,630
That's not even a showtime clip.
That was somebody else as 150,000

3006
02:06:48,631 --> 02:06:49,450
views on just a sec.

3007
02:06:49,530 --> 02:06:51,670
A clip and it's just really recent.
Yeah,

3008
02:06:51,780 --> 02:06:53,370
just they just put it out.
Yeah,

3009
02:06:53,730 --> 02:06:58,730
I mean his.
They're circulating all over the 

3010
02:06:58,730 --> 02:07:00,531
Internet.
It will just get way more traction as 

3011
02:07:00,531 --> 02:07:01,130
time goes on because it's so fun.
Yeah.

3012
02:07:01,140 --> 02:07:06,140
He's a killer.
Free Pr to buy all the politicians 

3013
02:07:06,140 --> 02:07:07,860
saying that like before they even put 
out the shows,

3014
02:07:07,861 --> 02:07:08,910
they're all like,
we got duped.

3015
02:07:08,911 --> 02:07:10,440
I got duped by them.
I got duped.

3016
02:07:10,480 --> 02:07:11,820
Dick Cheney,
Sarah Pailin.

3017
02:07:11,821 --> 02:07:16,821
They all came out and were like,
they thought he fucked me over data and 

3018
02:07:16,821 --> 02:07:18,420
then they had a billboard that somebody 
said he was doing stolen valor.

3019
02:07:18,421 --> 02:07:20,160
Did you see that?
Yeah.

3020
02:07:20,161 --> 02:07:21,570
What was that about?
Because you said that he was,

3021
02:07:21,571 --> 02:07:23,100
uh,
an injured soldier and an X.

3022
02:07:23,190 --> 02:07:24,780
Right.
There was an ad for him as an ex soldier

3023
02:07:24,781 --> 02:07:27,360
or something.
And so that got a ton of fucking press.

3024
02:07:27,420 --> 02:07:30,270
A ton of press wasn't at the Sarah Palin
One?

3025
02:07:30,650 --> 02:07:32,580
No,
I wasn't.

3026
02:07:32,581 --> 02:07:33,480
I don't know.
You'd have to look it up.

3027
02:07:33,481 --> 02:07:36,550
I don't remember which one it was.
I think it was a Sarah Pailin

3028
02:07:36,550 --> 02:07:38,020
one.
He was a disabled veteran,

3029
02:07:38,140 --> 02:07:39,730
but they were saying right.
Stolen Valor.

3030
02:07:39,731 --> 02:07:41,560
Selling them out all the shit.
Yeah.

3031
02:07:41,561 --> 02:07:43,210
They were trying anything to discredit 
it.

3032
02:07:43,390 --> 02:07:45,730
Well,
but if it's a comedy series,

3033
02:07:45,880 --> 02:07:50,880
it's a sketch comedy series.
You tell me a sketch character can't 

3034
02:07:50,880 --> 02:07:50,880
play whatever they want.
I mean,

3035
02:07:50,880 --> 02:07:51,250
that's,
that's what it is.

3036
02:07:51,330 --> 02:07:53,010
That's,
that's like people get mad.

3037
02:07:53,080 --> 02:07:54,790
Say No.
I mean if it's.

3038
02:07:55,260 --> 02:07:58,360
If you can play a character on a fee,
if you can play a war hero in a film,

3039
02:07:58,361 --> 02:08:01,540
why can you play the opposite?
Like born on the fourth of July.

3040
02:08:01,990 --> 02:08:02,950
Tom Cruise.
Okay.

3041
02:08:03,820 --> 02:08:08,820
What's so funny?
I was just thinking that I think the 

3042
02:08:08,820 --> 02:08:08,820
character,
he has what he is.

3043
02:08:08,820 --> 02:08:11,270
That is the the outright type guy.
Oh yeah,

3044
02:08:11,280 --> 02:08:12,940
yeah.
Saying is a bunch of stuff like that.

3045
02:08:12,941 --> 02:08:17,941
And showtime countered the claim here 
with the showtime counter.

3046
02:08:20,201 --> 02:08:22,060
Sacha Baron Cohen stolen valor claim.

3047
02:08:22,060 --> 02:08:23,110
Yeah,
the counter.

3048
02:08:23,350 --> 02:08:23,880
Well,
because they.

3049
02:08:23,920 --> 02:08:26,330
Because it was made public as long 
statement about it,

3050
02:08:26,690 --> 02:08:31,690
but widespread misinformation over the 
past week about the character of Billy 

3051
02:08:31,810 --> 02:08:33,160
Wayne Reddick junior phd performed by 
section.

3052
02:08:33,161 --> 02:08:36,520
What is the counter?
I think they explained what happened.

3053
02:08:36,521 --> 02:08:39,100
They sort of said that they didn't 
misrepresent themselves.

3054
02:08:39,101 --> 02:08:42,360
They probably thought he was someone 
riddick.

3055
02:08:42,570 --> 02:08:45,610
Riddick was asked by the senator.
He was disabled and he stated that he is

3056
02:08:45,611 --> 02:08:48,190
not an uses,
a mobility scooter to conserve energy.

3057
02:08:48,191 --> 02:08:53,191
In addition,
Bear Cohen never presented himself as a 

3058
02:08:53,191 --> 02:08:53,191
veteran of the US military,
former Alaskan governor,

3059
02:08:53,191 --> 02:08:54,940
Sarah Palin during the booking process 
or during the filming of her interview.

3060
02:08:55,000 --> 02:08:55,660
Okay,
so there you go.

3061
02:08:55,970 --> 02:08:57,560
Okay.
Scroll down a little bit lower.

3062
02:08:57,650 --> 02:09:02,650
Says on Monday a conservative street 
artists replaced a billboard near CBS 

3063
02:09:02,650 --> 02:09:06,371
television city complex in the Los 
Angeles with a doctored image of Cohen 

3064
02:09:06,741 --> 02:09:08,990
in a wheelchair wearing an army tee 
shirt.

3065
02:09:09,260 --> 02:09:14,260
The new billboard was kept caption sa,
Sacha Baron Cohen walks away with a hit 

3066
02:09:14,990 --> 02:09:18,380
and a touch of stolen valor.
Touch.

3067
02:09:18,750 --> 02:09:20,100
Yeah.
He's trying to say that it's a slight.

3068
02:09:20,160 --> 02:09:21,810
It's a slight at the.
At the troops.

3069
02:09:22,040 --> 02:09:22,890
Yeah.
Okay,

3070
02:09:23,130 --> 02:09:25,560
but how dare you mock those who have 
fought and served our country.

3071
02:09:25,561 --> 02:09:30,561
Truly sick.
Mock politicians and innocent 

3072
02:09:30,561 --> 02:09:30,561
personalities.
All you want

3073
02:09:32,410 --> 02:09:34,240
get balanced,
pale and said,

3074
02:09:34,410 --> 02:09:39,410
Pailin wrote on facebook.
You run a disrespect of our US military 

3075
02:09:39,410 --> 02:09:43,051
and middle class Americans via Cohen.
She's so stupid and middle class 

3076
02:09:43,051 --> 02:09:44,170
Americans.
Fuck you.

3077
02:09:44,290 --> 02:09:46,200
You're disrespectful to.
That's.

3078
02:09:46,570 --> 02:09:48,670
That's the disrespect,
but just that,

3079
02:09:48,700 --> 02:09:53,700
that trick.
She's just trying to game the system by 

3080
02:09:53,700 --> 02:09:57,570
state and middle class Americans.
Just get as many people in there as you 

3081
02:09:57,570 --> 02:10:01,501
can.
Prevent Cohen's foreign commentaries 

3082
02:10:01,501 --> 02:10:05,260
under the guise of interview questions,
foreign commentaries.

3083
02:10:06,100 --> 02:10:09,700
What does that mean?
Under the guise of she's so dumb because

3084
02:10:09,701 --> 02:10:12,460
you imagine that lady almost became our 
vice president.

3085
02:10:12,820 --> 02:10:15,610
Like what?
What the fuck would they think?

3086
02:10:15,611 --> 02:10:18,160
And they had mccain could have won.
Yeah,

3087
02:10:18,580 --> 02:10:19,450
yeah.
He could have one.

3088
02:10:19,500 --> 02:10:24,500
Yeah,
she was the anchor that fucking sunk 

3089
02:10:24,500 --> 02:10:24,760
that book.
But the idea that they thought that that

3090
02:10:24,761 --> 02:10:26,350
was a good idea.
Well,

3091
02:10:26,351 --> 02:10:28,990
she was a pawn man.
She was such an easy fucking pawn.

3092
02:10:29,170 --> 02:10:30,610
I don't think so.
I think shavers,

3093
02:10:30,700 --> 02:10:33,920
I think she was used as this little,
this good looking cute item,

3094
02:10:33,921 --> 02:10:34,030
a

3095
02:10:34,030 --> 02:10:39,030
female,
this middle American gun shooting she 

3096
02:10:39,030 --> 02:10:41,651
was upon.
I think she was a play and it went too 

3097
02:10:41,651 --> 02:10:41,651
far.
It was almost like they didn't know what

3098
02:10:41,651 --> 02:10:41,870
they had gotten themselves into.
They,

3099
02:10:41,871 --> 02:10:44,110
I think they thought that was a.
could been the.

3100
02:10:44,450 --> 02:10:49,450
It's one of those ingredients that could
have been brilliant or fucking the 

3101
02:10:49,450 --> 02:10:49,760
dumbest Shit on earth.
She was the governor of Alaska.

3102
02:10:49,790 --> 02:10:50,720
Right.
They figured,

3103
02:10:50,750 --> 02:10:52,390
hey,
she's a good looking woman.

3104
02:10:52,400 --> 02:10:54,710
She's the governor of a state.
She's a mom.

3105
02:10:54,711 --> 02:10:56,540
She shoots guns,
disabled child.

3106
02:10:56,870 --> 02:10:58,490
She had all the things that was like,
wow,

3107
02:10:58,491 --> 02:11:00,380
what a good pr push.
Yeah.

3108
02:11:00,410 --> 02:11:02,810
There was a disabled child while she was
running.

3109
02:11:02,990 --> 02:11:03,970
I'm almost positive.
Right.

3110
02:11:04,080 --> 02:11:05,930
She gave birth like almost like while 
she was.

3111
02:11:06,050 --> 02:11:06,300
No,
no,

3112
02:11:06,320 --> 02:11:08,210
I think she already had had a disabled 
child.

3113
02:11:08,690 --> 02:11:10,710
I think she had had a disabled kid.
Her,

3114
02:11:10,711 --> 02:11:12,530
her other son was a veteran,
right or,

3115
02:11:12,590 --> 02:11:13,220
or right.

3116
02:11:13,220 --> 02:11:17,790
And so she had all these things lined up
that were perfect for America.

3117
02:11:17,791 --> 02:11:22,791
So crazy.
It was so good when they started 

3118
02:11:22,791 --> 02:11:22,791
interviewing her.
So what,

3119
02:11:22,791 --> 02:11:23,480
what newspapers do you read?
All of them.

3120
02:11:23,481 --> 02:11:24,620
All of them.
All of them.

3121
02:11:24,740 --> 02:11:27,920
I can see Russia from my front porch.
Remember though,

3122
02:11:27,960 --> 02:11:29,090
a second.
See Russia?

3123
02:11:29,530 --> 02:11:31,040
That was right.
I look right across.

3124
02:11:31,041 --> 02:11:32,880
I see Russia from my porch.
I mean that.

3125
02:11:33,190 --> 02:11:36,020
Those were like soundbites for,
for America to be like she fucked.

3126
02:11:36,380 --> 02:11:39,560
But trump does the same thing.
He just does it in a.

3127
02:11:39,560 --> 02:11:40,380
no,
no,

3128
02:11:40,400 --> 02:11:40,700
no,
he,

3129
02:11:40,720 --> 02:11:41,450
he,
he does.

3130
02:11:41,510 --> 02:11:43,490
I heard about that again the other day 
because I was listening to,

3131
02:11:43,491 --> 02:11:44,330
uh,
the,

3132
02:11:44,780 --> 02:11:47,120
it's called the satire paradox.
Revisionist history.

3133
02:11:47,150 --> 02:11:49,220
Malcolm Gladwell,
and they were talking about this,

3134
02:11:49,240 --> 02:11:54,240
the therapy incident and a Tina fey 
actually said that and everyone thinks 

3135
02:11:54,681 --> 02:11:55,910
that's their appeal and actually said 
it.

3136
02:11:55,910 --> 02:11:59,120
It came from the snl spoof and 
completely got attributed to her.

3137
02:11:59,121 --> 02:12:04,121
And genius also ruined that whole thing 
that she could see it from her front 

3138
02:12:04,121 --> 02:12:04,880
porch.
That was from a sketch.

3139
02:12:04,910 --> 02:12:07,760
That's not what she did.
Say something about,

3140
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:09,290
she said something about Russia being 
there.

3141
02:12:09,291 --> 02:12:12,080
Her neighbor,
she did say something about Russia being

3142
02:12:12,081 --> 02:12:13,880
closely.
If they're going to come through Alaska.

3143
02:12:14,300 --> 02:12:17,270
She did say something preposterous like 
that.

3144
02:12:17,300 --> 02:12:22,300
If Russia came,
they would go through her right on 

3145
02:12:22,300 --> 02:12:26,950
snopes,
which isn't the best place to not be 

3146
02:12:26,950 --> 02:12:28,721
looking things up,
but like they have the article about it 

3147
02:12:28,721 --> 02:12:28,721
and it says that this came from an snl 
skit.

3148
02:12:28,721 --> 02:12:29,490
Okay.
Well instead of googling that,

3149
02:12:29,500 --> 02:12:33,890
just google Peyton's comment on being 
close to Russia.

3150
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:35,030
Right.
She said it sounds like what?

3151
02:12:35,031 --> 02:12:40,031
I googled.
I googled Sarah Pailin restaurant from 

3152
02:12:40,031 --> 02:12:40,031
my house,
but no,

3153
02:12:40,031 --> 02:12:40,031
no,
no,

3154
02:12:40,031 --> 02:12:40,031
no,
not that statement.

3155
02:12:40,031 --> 02:12:42,530
Russia from my house say Pailin on 
Russia,

3156
02:12:42,531 --> 02:12:45,140
being close to Alaska because she did 
say something.

3157
02:12:45,320 --> 02:12:47,090
She didn't say something that 
ridiculous.

3158
02:12:47,110 --> 02:12:52,110
Yeah.
It wasn't as toy said something 

3159
02:12:52,110 --> 02:12:52,110
ridiculous enough that people were like,
what?

3160
02:12:52,110 --> 02:12:56,390
What are you saying that?
And that's where through your 

3161
02:12:56,390 --> 02:12:56,390
neighborhood they got the influence to 
make that sketch.

3162
02:12:56,390 --> 02:12:57,290
They're going to fly in jets,
dummy.

3163
02:12:57,590 --> 02:13:01,160
Take a walk right across thinking here's
what's in Alaska.

3164
02:13:03,450 --> 02:13:05,130
But I think she.
But I think that was just,

3165
02:13:05,150 --> 02:13:07,010
you know,
I suppose as she tweeted,

3166
02:13:07,011 --> 02:13:11,110
remember I can keep an eye on them from 
here that her being like,

3167
02:13:11,150 --> 02:13:13,460
let's basically that's the statement.
But also.

3168
02:13:13,461 --> 02:13:18,461
But I think this comes on the heels of 
her publicly during at press at some 

3169
02:13:18,461 --> 02:13:22,961
point had said something about it.
It was kind of like how when trump says 

3170
02:13:22,961 --> 02:13:22,961
something once he repeats it over and 
over.

3171
02:13:22,961 --> 02:13:24,260
Like if you have watched those clips,
he'll say the same.

3172
02:13:24,650 --> 02:13:27,090
The same anecdote because it,
it,

3173
02:13:27,220 --> 02:13:32,220
it starts to drain.
The swamp wasn't once I was a thousand 

3174
02:13:32,220 --> 02:13:32,460
times.
I've to Tom Arnold last night.

3175
02:13:32,490 --> 02:13:35,610
I know Tom Arnold was backstage and he 
just got the trump tapes.

3176
02:13:35,611 --> 02:13:39,870
He said we got a gang of tapes.
He said there's some crazy shit.

3177
02:13:40,220 --> 02:13:40,860
Yeah,
I can't.

3178
02:13:40,861 --> 02:13:42,270
I don't want to disclose anything.
But yeah,

3179
02:13:42,450 --> 02:13:44,490
he's.
He said there is a tape.

3180
02:13:45,550 --> 02:13:46,220
Yeah.
Yeah.

3181
02:13:46,230 --> 02:13:50,780
He said there's a tape of him saying the
heart and word is repeated.

3182
02:13:50,900 --> 02:13:55,900
I just made you a face.
Like I was surprised at that for some 

3183
02:13:55,900 --> 02:13:55,900
reason your brain.

3184
02:13:58,230 --> 02:14:01,580
He said it's crazy.
He said that the tapes are crazy and not

3185
02:14:01,581 --> 02:14:03,270
putting them out again.
It's vice vice.

3186
02:14:03,320 --> 02:14:08,320
Yeah.
And he said people are turning on him 

3187
02:14:08,320 --> 02:14:11,510
left and right because he doesn't have 
loyalty to those people that are around 

3188
02:14:11,510 --> 02:14:14,841
him.
So apparently those people are turning 

3189
02:14:14,841 --> 02:14:14,841
on him left and right.
And testifying and,

3190
02:14:14,841 --> 02:14:17,280
and you know,
giving up evidence and information.

3191
02:14:17,750 --> 02:14:19,800
Like everybody realizes it's a sinking 
ship.

3192
02:14:20,340 --> 02:14:21,540
We were talking last night,
we're like,

3193
02:14:21,541 --> 02:14:22,820
dude,
it's only a year end.

3194
02:14:23,070 --> 02:14:24,150
Yeah.
One fucking year.

3195
02:14:24,180 --> 02:14:26,250
One year.
This guy's got three more years of this.

3196
02:14:27,010 --> 02:14:32,010
Saw The news yesterday about the call 
that Colin has the tape and he said that

3197
02:14:33,001 --> 02:14:34,370
trump knew about it.
Oh yeah.

3198
02:14:34,620 --> 02:14:36,300
And that's supposedly proves the 
collusion.

3199
02:14:36,760 --> 02:14:37,950
Yeah.
Yeah,

3200
02:14:38,070 --> 02:14:38,700
yeah,
yeah,

3201
02:14:39,120 --> 02:14:40,020
yeah.
Does that work?

3202
02:14:40,620 --> 02:14:45,620
What does that mean?
Timing did know about the meeting with 

3203
02:14:45,620 --> 02:14:45,900
Russia.
Collusion is,

3204
02:14:45,901 --> 02:14:47,280
is,
is proven.

3205
02:14:47,310 --> 02:14:47,840
Proven.
Yeah.

3206
02:14:47,841 --> 02:14:48,600
Then.
And then it can be.

3207
02:14:48,780 --> 02:14:52,140
He can be prosecuted.
Kenny be a sitting president.

3208
02:14:52,380 --> 02:14:53,030
Yeah.
Right.

3209
02:14:53,120 --> 02:14:58,120
If colluding.
I think you have to be impeached before 

3210
02:14:58,120 --> 02:14:58,120
you can be like,
well yeah,

3211
02:14:58,120 --> 02:14:58,910
you wasn't president.
Sure.

3212
02:14:59,070 --> 02:15:01,020
Week,
comfortable with President Pence.

3213
02:15:01,170 --> 02:15:03,360
No fucking way.
Is that happen?

3214
02:15:04,110 --> 02:15:06,330
Do they just,
can we have another election?

3215
02:15:06,870 --> 02:15:08,730
Do it again.
Can we do it again?

3216
02:15:09,290 --> 02:15:09,990
We could.
I mean,

3217
02:15:09,991 --> 02:15:11,670
I don't know if a TA.
It obviously hasn't happened,

3218
02:15:11,671 --> 02:15:13,700
but I don't know if Congress can call an
emergency election.

3219
02:15:14,060 --> 02:15:19,060
This is the thing.
Hillary has been ramping up the 

3220
02:15:19,060 --> 02:15:19,060
publicity lately.
It's almost like she's ready to get back

3221
02:15:19,060 --> 02:15:19,720
in there.
Well,

3222
02:15:19,800 --> 02:15:22,410
because she recognized because there's 
so much going on to try to.

3223
02:15:22,411 --> 02:15:23,880
People are trying to bury him.
Dude,

3224
02:15:24,300 --> 02:15:25,410
pence will be scary to me.
Man.

3225
02:15:25,440 --> 02:15:28,010
That kind of scary.
Scary now.

3226
02:15:28,040 --> 02:15:28,890
He's not a good.

3227
02:15:28,980 --> 02:15:33,980
I agree candidate,
but I'm second in line as him and that 

3228
02:15:33,980 --> 02:15:35,760
does freak me out to this kind of be a 
good Democrat out there.

3229
02:15:35,910 --> 02:15:40,910
Yeah.
Where it's not a compromised completely 

3230
02:15:40,910 --> 02:15:43,701
corrupt person has been embedded in the 
system forever and might've killed a 

3231
02:15:43,701 --> 02:15:47,361
bunch of portable.
I think everyone that you would want to 

3232
02:15:47,361 --> 02:15:47,361
run wouldn't.
I think you're right.

3233
02:15:47,361 --> 02:15:47,580
I think that's how I always feel when 
I'm like,

3234
02:15:47,581 --> 02:15:47,900
Oh,
you know,

3235
02:15:47,910 --> 02:15:49,980
it'd be great.
It's like I'm not fucking running.

3236
02:15:50,400 --> 02:15:54,340
What a nightmare gig to 100 grand a year
to B to b.

3237
02:15:54,400 --> 02:15:55,980
They make more than that now.
What is it?

3238
02:15:55,981 --> 02:15:58,120
Two 50,
400,

3239
02:15:58,880 --> 02:16:00,030
maybe,
maybe half a million,

3240
02:16:00,450 --> 02:16:02,700
half a million,
whatever before taxes.

3241
02:16:04,010 --> 02:16:06,540
Which trump won't pay.
Yeah,

3242
02:16:06,541 --> 02:16:07,340
man,
it's a.

3243
02:16:07,341 --> 02:16:10,110
it's a terrible job.
Terrible job and awful.

3244
02:16:10,200 --> 02:16:12,060
Really.
It should be a job that many,

3245
02:16:12,061 --> 02:16:13,230
many,
many people do.

3246
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:18,150
You one person's involved in the 
economy,

3247
02:16:18,240 --> 02:16:20,970
ecology environments,
everything.

3248
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:23,640
Military shake.
You play God.

3249
02:16:23,670 --> 02:16:26,520
You're playing God.
You have to puppeteer everything.

3250
02:16:26,521 --> 02:16:31,521
That doesn't make sense.
It wouldn't even work if you had a 

3251
02:16:31,521 --> 02:16:31,521
village.
Yeah,

3252
02:16:31,521 --> 02:16:35,340
and that would.
That would collapse because one farmer 

3253
02:16:35,340 --> 02:16:35,340
you had allegiance to would get mad.
Yeah.

3254
02:16:35,340 --> 02:16:38,340
You had to control all the crops.
You outta to control all the weapons you

3255
02:16:38,350 --> 02:16:40,810
had to control all the.
All the laws.

3256
02:16:41,080 --> 02:16:41,890
What the fuck?
Yeah.

3257
02:16:41,891 --> 02:16:43,450
Get out of control at even a micro 
level.

3258
02:16:43,630 --> 02:16:48,580
The weird thing is while he's president,
can he start pardoning people?

3259
02:16:49,350 --> 02:16:54,350
Will has had Disney.
Did he decides to pardon a bunch of 

3260
02:16:54,350 --> 02:16:55,540
people while he's president?
If he does that,

3261
02:16:55,840 --> 02:16:57,880
what is it still good?
If they put them in jail,

3262
02:16:59,290 --> 02:17:00,950
if he pardons while he's in office,
then there.

3263
02:17:01,200 --> 02:17:04,060
Then there scot free.
But you're saying after.

3264
02:17:04,090 --> 02:17:05,340
Yeah.
Yeah.

3265
02:17:05,410 --> 02:17:07,090
I don't know.
Like if he goes to jail,

3266
02:17:07,960 --> 02:17:08,590
I don't know.

3267
02:17:09,250 --> 02:17:10,480
Pardon?
People already already pardoned.

3268
02:17:10,660 --> 02:17:15,660
Yeah,
but he's saying like once I did a bunch 

3269
02:17:15,660 --> 02:17:15,660
of them,
right?

3270
02:17:15,660 --> 02:17:15,660
Yeah.
He has a bunch of.

3271
02:17:15,660 --> 02:17:15,660
Pardon?
Jack Johnson,

3272
02:17:15,660 --> 02:17:20,640
which is like a.
that's not really going to help Cat 

3273
02:17:20,640 --> 02:17:20,640
Stevens.
Still not.

3274
02:17:20,640 --> 02:17:20,640
Pardon man.
Peace train.

3275
02:17:20,640 --> 02:17:22,720
Still not finished to Susan.
Yeah.

3276
02:17:22,900 --> 02:17:23,990
Dinesh D'souza.
Right?

3277
02:17:24,250 --> 02:17:25,990
He pardoned.
Not Pardoned Cat Stevens.

3278
02:17:25,991 --> 02:17:29,380
Don't know what I'm saying.
But what is Cat Stevens in trouble for?

3279
02:17:29,450 --> 02:17:30,880
You remember this?
This was years and years ago.

3280
02:17:30,881 --> 02:17:33,280
Cat Stevens,
like a said,

3281
02:17:33,281 --> 02:17:35,870
now he's a part of Muslim faith and he 
left the United States and another,

3282
02:17:35,920 --> 02:17:39,490
but he also wanted a death for Salmon 
Rushdie.

3283
02:17:39,520 --> 02:17:41,790
Salman Rushdie,
and they wouldn't let him back in United

3284
02:17:41,790 --> 02:17:42,190
States.
They took away.

3285
02:17:42,220 --> 02:17:43,420
They've.
They took away his entry.

3286
02:17:43,421 --> 02:17:44,860
Right?
I don't even know if he's here now.

3287
02:17:44,880 --> 02:17:46,870
He does.
He goes concerts in Mexico.

3288
02:17:46,990 --> 02:17:49,230
People go down to Mexico to watch Cat 
Stevens concert.

3289
02:17:49,320 --> 02:17:51,190
Yeah.
Where you can get them down in Cabo.

3290
02:17:51,250 --> 02:17:56,250
Is that true?
Look it up with Cat Stevens is a lot of 

3291
02:17:56,250 --> 02:17:56,250
back in the United States.
I don't think so.

3292
02:17:56,250 --> 02:18:00,210
We're.
Let's look up cat Stevens tour dates 

3293
02:18:00,210 --> 02:18:03,150
because he went to go see him.
Let's go see if I'm being followed by a 

3294
02:18:03,761 --> 02:18:08,761
moon shadow.
Shadow shadow will go see him in 

3295
02:18:09,221 --> 02:18:11,650
Tiawana.
He's playing the border tour.

3296
02:18:11,740 --> 02:18:14,680
Could you imagine if we went to see him?
That'd be fucking fun.

3297
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:16,930
It'd be a fun piece to do.
Events currently booked.

3298
02:18:17,320 --> 02:18:18,340
Yeah,
he's having a tough time.

3299
02:18:20,240 --> 02:18:22,000
I think he did it because he needed some
money.

3300
02:18:22,090 --> 02:18:27,090
Oh totally.
He didn't have his publishing rights or 

3301
02:18:27,090 --> 02:18:27,090
something like that.
He lost money,

3302
02:18:27,090 --> 02:18:28,210
so we went on a tour,
try to get some checks,

3303
02:18:28,240 --> 02:18:30,580
got some chatter,
and then went back to the mosque.

3304
02:18:31,210 --> 02:18:33,220
All that chatter.
Bought some Hamas.

3305
02:18:33,880 --> 02:18:36,430
Pass it around.
Pita Pita,

3306
02:18:36,520 --> 02:18:38,200
you guys.
And you know.

3307
02:18:38,201 --> 02:18:39,700
That's one thing that an artist can do.

3308
02:18:39,700 --> 02:18:44,700
That's a musician that a comic can't do.
A musician can go back and do all their 

3309
02:18:45,251 --> 02:18:48,790
old hits and still raking it in mean the
beach boys.

3310
02:18:48,820 --> 02:18:53,820
They're not.
They could still go on tour and at a 

3311
02:18:53,820 --> 02:18:55,150
drop of a hat and make a ton of money.
Yeah.

3312
02:18:55,570 --> 02:19:00,570
Well they also.
They also bands now reconvened with new 

3313
02:19:00,570 --> 02:19:00,570
members and they make.
They still do that shit.

3314
02:19:00,570 --> 02:19:02,860
I mean the dead tour with John Mayer 
than fucking.

3315
02:19:02,861 --> 02:19:04,780
They're big ships because hair.
Yeah.

3316
02:19:05,050 --> 02:19:10,050
John Mayer,
the John Mayer handsome guy that hangs 

3317
02:19:10,050 --> 02:19:10,050
out with Dave chappelle tours with the 
dead.

3318
02:19:10,120 --> 02:19:12,340
He tours with sing.
Yes.

3319
02:19:12,670 --> 02:19:14,590
Get the fuck were to God on my life,
man.

3320
02:19:14,950 --> 02:19:19,950
Get the fuck dead.
Has that because he wants hippie pussy 

3321
02:19:19,950 --> 02:19:19,950
and deadheads.
Love it.

3322
02:19:19,950 --> 02:19:21,520
Love it.
Why do they love it?

3323
02:19:21,521 --> 02:19:26,521
I don't know.
I got a couple of friends that are dead 

3324
02:19:26,521 --> 02:19:26,521
heads and I never was into the dead,
but they were like,

3325
02:19:26,521 --> 02:19:26,521
it's.

3326
02:19:26,521 --> 02:19:27,320
There were skeptic.
There were skeptics at the beginning.

3327
02:19:27,470 --> 02:19:30,120
They're in fucking love with that guy 
because he paid.

3328
02:19:30,150 --> 02:19:33,170
Paid does it right man.
He fucking pays homage to the right way.

3329
02:19:33,171 --> 02:19:35,930
He's fucking God.
Fucking insane.

3330
02:19:36,110 --> 02:19:36,690
John.
Fucking.

3331
02:19:36,700 --> 02:19:38,210
Your body's a wonderland is playing 
dead.

3332
02:19:38,211 --> 02:19:43,211
So that's the world where it can't get 
any more absurd.

3333
02:19:47,060 --> 02:19:48,200
No,
it can't.

3334
02:19:48,350 --> 02:19:49,640
What does,
what does it say about cat?

3335
02:19:49,940 --> 02:19:52,570
He played some concerts in America in 
the last couple of days.

3336
02:19:52,600 --> 02:19:55,750
A lot back recently.
Who let them back in Obama,

3337
02:19:55,760 --> 02:20:00,760
the Muslim,
the Muslim hope that Kenyon article in 

3338
02:20:01,311 --> 02:20:03,530
the New Yorker about his comeback last 
year.

3339
02:20:03,650 --> 02:20:06,170
So last year he got let back in.
Wow.

3340
02:20:06,380 --> 02:20:09,080
Maybe a couple of years ago.
I'm much so it was before trump,

3341
02:20:09,260 --> 02:20:12,170
so it was probably one of Obama's last 
moves and office for sure.

3342
02:20:12,230 --> 02:20:14,120
Let them back in from on.
Fuck them.

3343
02:20:14,420 --> 02:20:16,760
Fuck the Donald.
We gotta go.

3344
02:20:16,761 --> 02:20:17,580
We gotta go to a cat.

3345
02:20:17,600 --> 02:20:20,430
It's shown up knowing God,
you got to go cat.

3346
02:20:20,750 --> 02:20:25,750
So it was within a year.
Maybe you won't come back now that 

3347
02:20:25,750 --> 02:20:27,350
trump's president.
I mean for money.

3348
02:20:27,351 --> 02:20:29,150
He'll fucking go anywhere.
I'm sure it's your last year.

3349
02:20:29,151 --> 02:20:32,150
Maybe it was the last.
The last year was last year.

3350
02:20:32,151 --> 02:20:33,800
Yeah.
He's saying now the trump is around.

3351
02:20:33,801 --> 02:20:36,200
He probably won't come back.
That's so funny.

3352
02:20:36,800 --> 02:20:38,270
Where was he living?
Did it say where he was?

3353
02:20:38,360 --> 02:20:40,370
Just doesn't say specifically.
Yeah,

3354
02:20:40,371 --> 02:20:42,810
he was on the fucking news on the Lam.
That cat was gone.

3355
02:20:42,811 --> 02:20:44,150
Yeah,
he's in Libya or some shit.

3356
02:20:44,180 --> 02:20:49,180
Fuck yeah.
Hold up in a compound in a cave and 

3357
02:20:49,180 --> 02:20:49,180
shit.
What a weird move.

3358
02:20:49,180 --> 02:20:49,330
Huh?
A guy who sings,

3359
02:20:49,340 --> 02:20:51,470
he's like really?
Pc Sof.

3360
02:20:52,100 --> 02:20:55,160
He's trained.
Whole fucking shit was out of picking up

3361
02:20:55,161 --> 02:20:57,380
people from coast to coast of the peace 
train.

3362
02:20:57,530 --> 02:21:02,530
Well,
there's people that believe that Islam 

3363
02:21:02,530 --> 02:21:02,530
is the religion of peace.

3364
02:21:02,530 --> 02:21:02,530
Totally.
The southern.

3365
02:21:02,870 --> 02:21:07,870
A lot of people believe in that shit,
so maybe he thinks he's on the path to 

3366
02:21:07,870 --> 02:21:12,140
peace and I think Islam is probably like
every other religion,

3367
02:21:12,340 --> 02:21:17,340
right?
There's factions of Christianity that 

3368
02:21:17,340 --> 02:21:17,340
are wonderful people.
Sure.

3369
02:21:17,340 --> 02:21:18,950
Really calm and sweet and loving and 
they get a lot out of it.

3370
02:21:18,951 --> 02:21:22,250
And then just people that are just 
fucking loons and the serpent handlers.

3371
02:21:22,310 --> 02:21:25,700
Yeah man.
Those fucking people as Christians.

3372
02:21:25,701 --> 02:21:30,701
Those are my favorite Christians.
The ones with the snake protect me from 

3373
02:21:31,161 --> 02:21:33,250
the serpent.
The snake,

3374
02:21:33,560 --> 02:21:38,560
the snake.
My whole family had been surfing 

3375
02:21:38,560 --> 02:21:38,560
handlers.
Sense Wade was sweater.

3376
02:21:38,560 --> 02:21:41,240
We've been a part of the serpent culture
serpent or serpent?

3377
02:21:41,241 --> 02:21:43,270
Paypal and they use poisonous snakes 
too.

3378
02:21:43,320 --> 02:21:48,320
Oh yeah.
Wasn't there a documentary on serpent 

3379
02:21:48,320 --> 02:21:48,320
handlers?
I feel like there's a documentary that I

3380
02:21:48,320 --> 02:21:50,630
have on my queue.
I have so much shit.

3381
02:21:50,631 --> 02:21:52,220
I'm supposed to watch the students.

3382
02:21:52,580 --> 02:21:55,460
I'm so behind on the.
I got to walk away.

3383
02:21:55,580 --> 02:21:59,120
I'm only in wild wild country.
I'm only on episode four.

3384
02:21:59,540 --> 02:22:00,590
I need to.
It's good,

3385
02:22:00,591 --> 02:22:04,020
but it's slow at the big chunks of slow 
days where you're like,

3386
02:22:04,400 --> 02:22:06,260
people say that it could have been done 
in three,

3387
02:22:06,360 --> 02:22:11,360
could have easily.
There's a lot of drag out that you're 

3388
02:22:11,360 --> 02:22:11,360
like,
didn't we go over this already?

3389
02:22:11,360 --> 02:22:12,770
But that's just them being like,
fuck,

3390
02:22:13,860 --> 02:22:16,490
come on Netflix.
Netflix wants six.

3391
02:22:16,491 --> 02:22:18,080
I want six.
You want six?

3392
02:22:18,370 --> 02:22:21,650
Six netflix.
They don't need more fucking money.

3393
02:22:22,310 --> 02:22:27,310
They own Hollywood there.
I couldn't get out 30 comedy specials 

3394
02:22:27,310 --> 02:22:29,820
just from just for laughs.
That's nothing that bill sent me.

3395
02:22:30,660 --> 02:22:31,860
They can't even.
They weren't even sniff.

3396
02:22:31,861 --> 02:22:36,861
One of my fucking far.
I can't even fucking get near them for 

3397
02:22:36,861 --> 02:22:36,861
some reason.
Netflix wants nothing to do with me.

3398
02:22:37,260 --> 02:22:39,090
I don't know what the fuck they're thing
is with me.

3399
02:22:39,390 --> 02:22:44,390
Maybe I did something wrong years ago.
They're doing putting out so many 

3400
02:22:44,390 --> 02:22:44,390
specials.
I'm like,

3401
02:22:44,390 --> 02:22:45,570
how come I can't get anything to do with
you?

3402
02:22:45,571 --> 02:22:47,190
I don't know.
They probably haven't seen you.

3403
02:22:47,330 --> 02:22:48,090
You know,
the thing is,

3404
02:22:48,091 --> 02:22:49,920
man can keep up.
Yeah.

3405
02:22:49,921 --> 02:22:51,120
No,
I think there's too much going on.

3406
02:22:51,240 --> 02:22:53,700
The only thing keep up.
Did they have enough people?

3407
02:22:53,820 --> 02:22:54,770
I really don't.
I mean,

3408
02:22:54,800 --> 02:22:57,570
I feel like there's so much comedy going
on right now.

3409
02:22:58,260 --> 02:23:01,470
Have you ever seen more standup?
Never in my life.

3410
02:23:01,960 --> 02:23:03,240
It's,
it's overwhelming.

3411
02:23:03,760 --> 02:23:07,280
There's a lot more shit comedy being put
out than I've ever seen or,

3412
02:23:07,360 --> 02:23:09,860
or not shit comedy in terms of my 
opinion in terms of like,

3413
02:23:10,650 --> 02:23:13,710
just see just comedy for the sake of 
comedy.

3414
02:23:13,711 --> 02:23:16,410
Then I'm like,
this isn't a fucking well put together.

3415
02:23:16,411 --> 02:23:21,411
Special people didn't take time for.
Some of these things are pumping them 

3416
02:23:21,411 --> 02:23:21,411
out.
Yeah,

3417
02:23:21,411 --> 02:23:21,411
there's definitely that too.

3418
02:23:21,411 --> 02:23:22,920
And there's people that are taking 
advantage of an opportunity,

3419
02:23:22,921 --> 02:23:27,921
right?
Somebody offers you a shitload of money 

3420
02:23:27,921 --> 02:23:27,921
and you don't really have a set ready.
Oh,

3421
02:23:27,921 --> 02:23:31,981
they just fucking want to do that.
That's the one thing that happens with 

3422
02:23:31,981 --> 02:23:33,390
people when they start doing movies.
When you start doing movies,

3423
02:23:33,391 --> 02:23:38,391
you're on a set 16 hours a day.
You don't really have enough time to 

3424
02:23:38,391 --> 02:23:38,640
write and you're definitely not 
performing every no way.

3425
02:23:39,210 --> 02:23:44,210
That is a crazy move to be doing all 
these films and then do an hour special 

3426
02:23:44,400 --> 02:23:45,420
when you.
You're barely.

3427
02:23:45,990 --> 02:23:49,050
Yeah,
they can do 30 and they're pushing 30 on

3428
02:23:49,051 --> 02:23:53,820
fun shit in between maybe even 30 men 
because not even 30,

3429
02:23:54,210 --> 02:23:59,210
like a real rock 'em sock.
'Em robots 30 know a really know it's 

3430
02:23:59,210 --> 02:24:00,630
probably not a back to back 30,
like bang,

3431
02:24:00,631 --> 02:24:01,080
Bang,
Bang,

3432
02:24:01,081 --> 02:24:02,880
Bang.
It's more thin than that.

3433
02:24:02,881 --> 02:24:04,230
There's a lot of shit out there.

3434
02:24:05,010 --> 02:24:07,440
Louis said this to me once backstage and
I think he's right.

3435
02:24:07,470 --> 02:24:09,120
He's like,
in order to do comedy,

3436
02:24:09,121 --> 02:24:11,040
to really do it.
You can't do anything else.

3437
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:17,000
That's probably the only way to be the 
best at it was you could do it and you 

3438
02:24:17,000 --> 02:24:17,000
can do it good,
but to be at your best,

3439
02:24:17,000 --> 02:24:18,330
you really can't be doing anything else.
I believe that.

3440
02:24:18,780 --> 02:24:20,360
I believe that wholeheartedly.
Yeah.

3441
02:24:20,740 --> 02:24:23,640
Miami thinking you have podcasts because
podcasts are just talking.

3442
02:24:25,540 --> 02:24:26,210
Yeah.
This,

3443
02:24:26,750 --> 02:24:31,750
this is working out for working out at 
comedy to do a special like podcasting 

3444
02:24:32,780 --> 02:24:37,780
and comedic relationships and us still 
moving in whatever realm that is for 

3445
02:24:37,780 --> 02:24:38,490
comedy,
if it's all branching for it,

3446
02:24:38,790 --> 02:24:41,610
but other things.
Acting that takes totally away from it.

3447
02:24:41,660 --> 02:24:43,560
Yeah,
because when I go do acting shit,

3448
02:24:43,561 --> 02:24:47,120
I'm totally disconnected.
Comedy loses its breath for awhile.

3449
02:24:47,600 --> 02:24:52,600
Well,
what about when you were doing acting 

3450
02:24:52,600 --> 02:24:52,600
on?

3451
02:24:52,600 --> 02:24:52,600
I'm dying up here.
I performed them almost every night.

3452
02:24:52,600 --> 02:24:53,400
Right?
I didn't give a fuck.

3453
02:24:53,401 --> 02:24:56,340
I was burning the candle at both ends.
I didn't care because you had to.

3454
02:24:56,970 --> 02:24:59,100
Because I know because I also know that 
I don't want to lose steps.

3455
02:24:59,101 --> 02:25:00,690
I was like,
I don't want to fucking lose steps.

3456
02:25:00,920 --> 02:25:02,640
Yeah.
I care about acting.

3457
02:25:03,090 --> 02:25:04,950
Not as much as I care about standup.
Yeah.

3458
02:25:04,951 --> 02:25:06,090
You care about it like.
Yeah.

3459
02:25:06,091 --> 02:25:07,530
That's cool.
I like it a lot.

3460
02:25:07,531 --> 02:25:08,900
It's not your thing.
No.

3461
02:25:08,970 --> 02:25:11,550
I'm in love with stand up.
Acting is like.

3462
02:25:11,551 --> 02:25:12,240
Yeah,
I like it.

3463
02:25:12,241 --> 02:25:13,980
I like it a lot.
It's very rewarding.

3464
02:25:13,981 --> 02:25:18,981
I'm not.
I'm not and I'm not disrespecting the 

3465
02:25:18,981 --> 02:25:21,081
art.
I'm just saying it doesn't do the same 

3466
02:25:21,081 --> 02:25:21,081
thing for me that stand up does.
Right,

3467
02:25:21,081 --> 02:25:25,340
but what if I don't go out at night and 
try to make sure I'm on booking shows 

3468
02:25:25,340 --> 02:25:25,340
late night

3469
02:25:25,340 --> 02:25:27,370
to do you lose.
You definitely get disconnected.

3470
02:25:27,710 --> 02:25:29,950
Peep and they people who do it know who 
they are.

3471
02:25:30,100 --> 02:25:31,790
They know when it happens.
Sure.

3472
02:25:32,060 --> 02:25:36,510
Tend to do sitcoms to the sitcoms will 
do it to youtube because you're on set.

3473
02:25:36,560 --> 02:25:37,750
I killed it for me,
man,

3474
02:25:37,990 --> 02:25:42,990
when I was on news radio,
there was a stretch where I was doing 

3475
02:25:42,990 --> 02:25:45,901
set.
I was doing standup for a couple of 

3476
02:25:45,901 --> 02:25:45,901
years where I was from writing any 
jokes,

3477
02:25:45,901 --> 02:25:49,410
just doing the same shit shit and I was 
getting disconnected with the jokes and 

3478
02:25:49,410 --> 02:25:50,680
I was starting to bomb.
And then you hate him.

3479
02:25:50,710 --> 02:25:52,420
You hate the material.
Well,

3480
02:25:52,421 --> 02:25:55,630
you talked to jeff to a couple of days 
ago in Garland.

3481
02:25:55,650 --> 02:26:00,650
You know he does it.
He just goes in wings it all the time 

3482
02:26:00,650 --> 02:26:03,570
because he loves it.
He doesn't want to fuck because he's on 

3483
02:26:03,570 --> 02:26:05,451
set all fucking day,
so I don't know where he's finding time 

3484
02:26:05,451 --> 02:26:05,451
to write stuff anyway because Jeff's 
like,

3485
02:26:05,451 --> 02:26:09,720
no,
I just like to have fun because he 

3486
02:26:09,720 --> 02:26:09,720
doesn't.

3487
02:26:09,720 --> 02:26:09,720
He doesn't have any time.
He's.

3488
02:26:09,720 --> 02:26:11,710
He's doing 50 things at once.
He doesn't have time to sit down and go,

3489
02:26:11,860 --> 02:26:16,860
all right,
let me try to pump out some new 

3490
02:26:16,860 --> 02:26:16,860
material.
He's not on a plane,

3491
02:26:16,860 --> 02:26:18,460
on the road to shows today's on to hit 
to hit shows.

3492
02:26:18,520 --> 02:26:23,520
Isn't it funny too?
He's saying that he doesn't want to do 

3493
02:26:23,520 --> 02:26:23,690
15 minutes sets.
I just do like an hour on Friday and see

3494
02:26:23,700 --> 02:26:25,240
items now or.
I disagree with it too.

3495
02:26:25,241 --> 02:26:27,640
I didn't understand it when he said it's
a waste of my time to leave the house.

3496
02:26:28,210 --> 02:26:30,250
The first thing I said,
I'm in my kitchen listening to it and if

3497
02:26:30,251 --> 02:26:30,850
he's gone,
I'm not gonna.

3498
02:26:30,851 --> 02:26:31,840
Leave my house.
Fifteen minutes ago.

3499
02:26:32,040 --> 02:26:37,040
Fucking joe sitting right across your.
He leaves his house for fucking 15 

3500
02:26:37,040 --> 02:26:37,040
minutes.
I did it last night.

3501
02:26:37,040 --> 02:26:37,040
Yeah,
no shit.

3502
02:26:37,040 --> 02:26:38,110
Constantly talking about.
Yeah.

3503
02:26:38,120 --> 02:26:39,520
I think it's a different.

3504
02:26:39,520 --> 02:26:42,480
I think it's just a different breed of 
certain people are like that,

3505
02:26:42,481 --> 02:26:43,220
that they're like,
Nah,

3506
02:26:43,340 --> 02:26:46,510
on maximize that time and only do it at 
this chunk,

3507
02:26:46,570 --> 02:26:50,240
but certain people you meet,
if I.

3508
02:26:50,740 --> 02:26:52,510
That is the maximizing of the chunk of 
being.

3509
02:26:52,511 --> 02:26:53,470
Like if it's just 15,
I'm going to.

3510
02:26:53,530 --> 02:26:56,350
I'm going to make sure that 15 is.
He doesn't have bits though.

3511
02:26:56,470 --> 02:26:58,970
Not the same way.
Like he's just a funny guy.

3512
02:26:59,030 --> 02:27:02,190
He raves and Improv in Improv.
Yeah,

3513
02:27:02,380 --> 02:27:07,380
but he doesn't have like a chunk on lava
lamps and they're gone wristwatches,

3514
02:27:07,610 --> 02:27:12,610
you know,
he doesn't have that like I to open up 

3515
02:27:12,610 --> 02:27:12,610
with lava lamps.
That's not this what he does.

3516
02:27:12,630 --> 02:27:17,630
Well No,
like he did a fallon set a couple of 

3517
02:27:17,630 --> 02:27:17,630
years ago.
Maybe it was a year ago,

3518
02:27:17,630 --> 02:27:22,591
two years ago,
and it was all about lotion at the 

3519
02:27:22,591 --> 02:27:22,591
airport and that was like a bit.

3520
02:27:22,591 --> 02:27:22,591
That was the first time I'd seen jeff do
a.

3521
02:27:22,591 --> 02:27:23,280
because you know,
again,

3522
02:27:23,340 --> 02:27:25,360
again,
this is obviously no disrespect to Jeff.

3523
02:27:25,361 --> 02:27:26,800
I Love Jeff.
Jeff's a great guy to me,

3524
02:27:27,460 --> 02:27:28,650
but what he does is,
yeah,

3525
02:27:28,651 --> 02:27:31,180
it's that it's much more like free form 
and unfailing.

3526
02:27:31,181 --> 02:27:32,140
He did like a bit.
I was like,

3527
02:27:32,141 --> 02:27:32,860
oh,
that's like a bit.

3528
02:27:32,920 --> 02:27:34,930
And I.
Jeff doesn't really do bits.

3529
02:27:35,350 --> 02:27:36,850
It doesn't chunk out bits.
He's like,

3530
02:27:37,360 --> 02:27:39,910
if he finds a bit it'll be great.
You know what I mean?

3531
02:27:39,911 --> 02:27:42,100
But he usually just fucking around.
I watched him in Atlanta.

3532
02:27:42,400 --> 02:27:43,810
We were both playing Atlanta at the same
time.

3533
02:27:44,260 --> 02:27:49,260
He was just,
he was shitting on like a one of the 

3534
02:27:49,260 --> 02:27:49,600
other comics and it was,
it was hysterical.

3535
02:27:49,630 --> 02:27:51,180
He was just fucking around with the 
other conflict.

3536
02:27:51,190 --> 02:27:52,530
One of the other comics that went on 
before,

3537
02:27:52,980 --> 02:27:57,980
but the,
that took up 15 minutes of him just 

3538
02:27:57,980 --> 02:27:59,350
fucking around and then got into like 
talking to them while he's loose.

3539
02:27:59,460 --> 02:28:00,710
Oh.
So I mean,

3540
02:28:00,760 --> 02:28:04,180
one of the funny things that he said was
that he's so comfortable with just being

3541
02:28:04,181 --> 02:28:04,900
funny.
Oh,

3542
02:28:04,901 --> 02:28:08,740
and I have to tell Andrew dice clay,
he was not disrespecting you.

3543
02:28:08,800 --> 02:28:11,650
Dice dice went on this whole rant about 
fat.

3544
02:28:11,651 --> 02:28:16,651
Jeff given them a hard time,
he thinks because garland was saying 

3545
02:28:16,651 --> 02:28:18,340
that it was Rick Rubin's idea to do the 
day.

3546
02:28:18,341 --> 02:28:20,400
The laughter died.
Dice is like,

3547
02:28:20,410 --> 02:28:21,560
no,
it was my fucking.

3548
02:28:21,630 --> 02:28:25,410
I fucking was very upset.
He was very happy.

3549
02:28:25,411 --> 02:28:26,300
He get really mad.
Yeah,

3550
02:28:26,360 --> 02:28:27,080
yeah.
Yeah.

3551
02:28:27,081 --> 02:28:30,140
Dice kits map like that though.
That's so strange.

3552
02:28:30,830 --> 02:28:32,270
I know he got.
I know he goes.

3553
02:28:32,290 --> 02:28:35,170
I know.
There was all sorts of a dicer.

3554
02:28:35,390 --> 02:28:36,590
Sebastian.
Weird,

3555
02:28:36,890 --> 02:28:39,470
strange fucking beat.
What happened there?

3556
02:28:39,471 --> 02:28:44,471
I don't know dude.
It was like Sebastian dice had said 

3557
02:28:44,471 --> 02:28:48,341
something online I guess on instagram 
about Sebastian stealing his act or 

3558
02:28:48,341 --> 02:28:48,341
doing his shit.

3559
02:28:49,910 --> 02:28:54,910
Emulating him or something like he was 
going after Sebastian for some fucking 

3560
02:28:54,910 --> 02:28:55,070
reason.
So passion is very original.

3561
02:28:56,000 --> 02:28:57,620
He's him.
No one is Sebastian,

3562
02:28:57,680 --> 02:28:58,910
but that's who he is.
Well,

3563
02:28:58,911 --> 02:29:03,310
I think sometimes can use to open for 
him years and years and years ago is um,

3564
02:29:03,400 --> 02:29:04,660
if I'm not wrong people.
Correct.

3565
02:29:04,661 --> 02:29:09,661
You're right.
And I think maybe dice felt like he's 

3566
02:29:09,661 --> 02:29:09,661
not giving them as do.
It's like dissecting,

3567
02:29:09,661 --> 02:29:13,750
like I fucking raised you and you're not
even going to kiss the ring a little 

3568
02:29:13,750 --> 02:29:13,750
bit.
First of all,

3569
02:29:13,750 --> 02:29:16,970
grown ass man who's built his own career
completely on his own and brilliantly so

3570
02:29:17,150 --> 02:29:22,150
he has no anybody shit,
wasn't it that he didn't talk about 

3571
02:29:22,150 --> 02:29:23,570
Dyson as book perhaps?
That's probably the crux of it.

3572
02:29:23,630 --> 02:29:25,600
I think it's the layers for the for,
for,

3573
02:29:25,700 --> 02:29:27,560
for old friendships like that that have 
gone sour.

3574
02:29:27,561 --> 02:29:28,970
Maybe it's layers.
It's that.

3575
02:29:29,090 --> 02:29:30,950
It's why don't you go to my fucking 
dinner party?

3576
02:29:30,950 --> 02:29:31,910
You know what I mean?
It's bullshit.

3577
02:29:31,911 --> 02:29:36,110
It's all bullshit piled up when you get 
a guy opening for you for years and then

3578
02:29:36,111 --> 02:29:38,660
he's smashing it.
Now he's a fucking superstar.

3579
02:29:38,920 --> 02:29:40,490
Yeah.
That's got to feel weird.

3580
02:29:41,060 --> 02:29:43,050
It's got to feel it.
It's got to feel weird.

3581
02:29:43,060 --> 02:29:48,060
I'm envious of what Sebastian's done 
because Sebastian can kind of go 

3582
02:29:48,060 --> 02:29:48,060
anywhere.
Yeah.

3583
02:29:48,060 --> 02:29:48,890
It does anything,
but I mean,

3584
02:29:48,920 --> 02:29:52,010
he's like,
he's really successful,

3585
02:29:52,190 --> 02:29:55,700
but he's also like this weird kind of 
famous.

3586
02:29:56,270 --> 02:29:57,800
Well,
he could like go to the movies.

3587
02:29:57,830 --> 02:30:00,630
He's famous restaurants famous.
He's famous,

3588
02:30:00,660 --> 02:30:03,830
but buddy sells out tickets like he's 
mega famous.

3589
02:30:03,880 --> 02:30:08,880
Well,
we talked about this when I was in 

3590
02:30:08,880 --> 02:30:08,880
Vegas.
I walked by.

3591
02:30:08,880 --> 02:30:11,831
Gaffigan was playing one of the things,
one of the arenas there and had a 

3592
02:30:11,831 --> 02:30:11,960
billboard up that said,
you know,

3593
02:30:11,961 --> 02:30:12,920
Jim Gaffigan,
28,

3594
02:30:12,921 --> 02:30:13,490
29,
whatever,

3595
02:30:13,940 --> 02:30:15,860
and I was saying to the comic that I was
with,

3596
02:30:15,861 --> 02:30:20,861
I was like,
isn't that funny that like if Gavin was 

3597
02:30:20,861 --> 02:30:23,231
just like walking through the casino,
there's a good chance a lot of people 

3598
02:30:23,231 --> 02:30:23,231
just wouldn't see him see him.

3599
02:30:23,231 --> 02:30:23,720
Do you know what I mean?
They might,

3600
02:30:23,810 --> 02:30:28,810
they might,
but in that fucking arena sold out five 

3601
02:30:28,810 --> 02:30:32,831
shows.
Sold out like unmistakably famous and 

3602
02:30:32,831 --> 02:30:32,831
standup.
Yeah.

3603
02:30:32,831 --> 02:30:33,590
But he's the Kinda guy that could go to 
Ralph's and you'd be like,

3604
02:30:33,591 --> 02:30:34,820
uh,
someone will go.

3605
02:30:35,030 --> 02:30:37,730
I think that that guy he looks like 
maybe he's not.

3606
02:30:37,731 --> 02:30:38,810
I don't know.
Do you know what I mean?

3607
02:30:38,811 --> 02:30:40,370
Like these songs,
but hey,

3608
02:30:40,371 --> 02:30:42,290
hot pockets.
Hot pockets.

3609
02:30:42,291 --> 02:30:43,320
Yeah.
Be it.

3610
02:30:44,090 --> 02:30:48,660
Can I get a selfie selfie bro?
Come on,

3611
02:30:48,710 --> 02:30:49,850
man.
I like going.

3612
02:30:49,851 --> 02:30:52,280
I like going with you to watch how 
people ask you for selfies.

3613
02:30:52,490 --> 02:30:55,220
My favorite thing is when I'm with Joe 
and somebody asked me if they can take a

3614
02:30:55,221 --> 02:30:56,440
picture of Joe.
That's the.

3615
02:30:56,990 --> 02:30:57,670
No,
look at me.

3616
02:30:57,870 --> 02:30:59,060
We're talking,
hey,

3617
02:30:59,061 --> 02:31:02,030
do you mind to me?
I'm not his fucking hand.

3618
02:31:02,240 --> 02:31:05,240
Why are you asking me?
That's the.

3619
02:31:05,270 --> 02:31:07,610
That's so annoying to me.
Don't look at me dude,

3620
02:31:07,730 --> 02:31:09,290
if you want to converse with a grown 
man,

3621
02:31:09,291 --> 02:31:14,291
do it and not your through line to get 
to Joe Gaffigan's doing an interesting 

3622
02:31:14,291 --> 02:31:14,610
thing.
He decided to.

3623
02:31:14,660 --> 02:31:17,780
He on his own to not put a special on 
Netflix.

3624
02:31:18,250 --> 02:31:20,040
It was a conscious because

3625
02:31:20,040 --> 02:31:25,040
he felt like there's so many digital 
platforms on who's going to offer it 

3626
02:31:25,040 --> 02:31:25,350
among all the other platforms,
so he's got it on.

3627
02:31:25,380 --> 02:31:27,870
Amazon's got it on Hulu.
Who's got it everywhere?

3628
02:31:28,020 --> 02:31:31,680
We're where the see find out the places.
Gaffigan put out his special on.

3629
02:31:31,710 --> 02:31:33,090
I've seen the billboard and it 
mentioned.

3630
02:31:33,091 --> 02:31:35,630
Is that on the bottom it says available 
on all platforms.

3631
02:31:35,640 --> 02:31:38,120
I have seen that Amazon platform.
Replatform step.

3632
02:31:38,220 --> 02:31:39,120
Netflix.
Yeah.

3633
02:31:39,350 --> 02:31:40,980
He has been kind of crazy.
I get that he wants to.

3634
02:31:41,010 --> 02:31:45,000
He stood out his whole career as being a
clean.

3635
02:31:45,360 --> 02:31:50,360
You know what I mean?
Like I think this is another way of him 

3636
02:31:50,360 --> 02:31:50,430
being like,
I'm also not grouped like that as well.

3637
02:31:51,240 --> 02:31:56,240
I think that he made the decision was 
that there's just so many other 

3638
02:31:56,240 --> 02:31:58,350
platforms available that he didn't want 
to limit it to Netflix and be one of the

3639
02:31:58,351 --> 02:31:59,730
many on Netflix already.

3640
02:31:59,790 --> 02:32:00,610
You know,
may.

3641
02:32:00,611 --> 02:32:03,480
I mean it might be actually a smarter,
more lucrative move.

3642
02:32:03,481 --> 02:32:08,160
Although the access that people have 
probably isn't as good as you think.

3643
02:32:08,161 --> 02:32:12,030
Netflix is a global brand.
That's the problem with giant huge.

3644
02:32:12,620 --> 02:32:14,250
It's just the thing.
Yeah.

3645
02:32:14,460 --> 02:32:19,460
But if you have it on youtube,
youtube is probably bigger than 

3646
02:32:19,460 --> 02:32:20,130
anything,
right?

3647
02:32:20,430 --> 02:32:23,610
More people watched this.
Youtube has a bigger reach,

3648
02:32:23,640 --> 02:32:25,710
but it's just way more content on 
youtube.

3649
02:32:26,050 --> 02:32:27,180
Right.
But here's the other thing.

3650
02:32:27,540 --> 02:32:30,510
Who's watching youtube on television at 
home,

3651
02:32:30,970 --> 02:32:35,970
the new gender.
There's a lot of kids that are due 

3652
02:32:35,970 --> 02:32:35,970
because now youtube TV is like a big 
thing,

3653
02:32:35,970 --> 02:32:39,530
but how many in comparison to to watch 
Netflix and I'm sure Netflix to launch 

3654
02:32:39,530 --> 02:32:41,670
that ass Netflix at home.
Netflix owns that ass.

3655
02:32:42,260 --> 02:32:47,260
I would think about the mobile though.
How many people watch Netflix on their 

3656
02:32:47,260 --> 02:32:47,260
phone?
A lot.

3657
02:32:47,260 --> 02:32:48,780
I think there's one netflix or one.

3658
02:32:48,810 --> 02:32:51,510
I just did my special.
They said half the people,

3659
02:32:51,570 --> 02:32:52,890
so it is on youtube too.
Yeah.

3660
02:32:53,120 --> 02:32:56,250
Have people found a netflix watching on 
their phone?

3661
02:32:56,460 --> 02:32:57,300
Well,
look at it like this.

3662
02:32:57,330 --> 02:32:59,760
I've never pulled up youtube on my,
on my computer.

3663
02:33:00,000 --> 02:33:00,720
I mean I,
I,

3664
02:33:00,750 --> 02:33:05,750
I rarely.
I'm saying I put it on my phone every 

3665
02:33:05,750 --> 02:33:07,851
fucking day.
There's something on my phone that I'm 

3666
02:33:07,851 --> 02:33:07,851
looking up on Youtube.
Yeah,

3667
02:33:07,851 --> 02:33:07,851
that's true.
Always,

3668
02:33:07,851 --> 02:33:07,851
always,
always,

3669
02:33:07,851 --> 02:33:09,990
always on the phone and if I'm at the 
house,

3670
02:33:10,110 --> 02:33:15,110
if I had watching something on my phone 
and I'll flick it to my apple tv or 

3671
02:33:15,110 --> 02:33:19,731
whatever,
he put it in movie theaters for a day 

3672
02:33:19,731 --> 02:33:19,731
too.
That's cool.

3673
02:33:19,731 --> 02:33:22,540
That's a cool move.
While it's on the move.

3674
02:33:22,650 --> 02:33:23,940
Well how many,
how long is it?

3675
02:33:25,080 --> 02:33:26,370
Seventy minutes.
Seventy minutes.

3676
02:33:26,490 --> 02:33:29,220
That seems like annoying to go to the 
movies for 70 minutes.

3677
02:33:29,270 --> 02:33:30,750
Yeah.
However you have an opening act.

3678
02:33:30,750 --> 02:33:35,750
You fuck.
He's got a warm up guy that just stands 

3679
02:33:35,750 --> 02:33:38,220
up there on a 90 minute show.
Come on.

3680
02:33:38,320 --> 02:33:40,320
When we were backstage last night,
we were like,

3681
02:33:40,350 --> 02:33:41,700
you know,
because we had a lot of guys on the show

3682
02:33:41,701 --> 02:33:42,780
last night,
the late show.

3683
02:33:42,940 --> 02:33:44,400
We're like,
this show's going to go long.

3684
02:33:44,401 --> 02:33:47,590
We're like fucking scorsese movies at 
three hours trying matches.

3685
02:33:47,591 --> 02:33:52,591
Scorsese movie that.
That fucking main room needs a new AC 

3686
02:33:52,591 --> 02:33:56,241
unit though was drenched.
I was soaked through a tit sweat when 

3687
02:33:56,401 --> 02:34:01,401
you gave me a hug when I brought you on,
I didn't want to hug you because my 

3688
02:34:01,401 --> 02:34:03,060
fucking shirt was stuck to my body and 
my mind was minutes.

3689
02:34:03,061 --> 02:34:05,700
I was totally drenched by the time I got
upstairs and just fix it.

3690
02:34:05,730 --> 02:34:10,730
Well,
they are struggling with money over 

3691
02:34:10,730 --> 02:34:10,730
there.
Fucking money.

3692
02:34:10,730 --> 02:34:13,910
It's a money pit.
Isn't it crazy that that place used to 

3693
02:34:13,910 --> 02:34:13,910
be struggling for money and now they 
just.

3694
02:34:13,910 --> 02:34:16,200
They sold out two shows in the main room
yesterday.

3695
02:34:16,350 --> 02:34:17,080
Showing the,
Oh,

3696
02:34:17,130 --> 02:34:18,070
are showing

3697
02:34:18,070 --> 02:34:23,070
the fucking bell.
It was just people constantly running 

3698
02:34:23,070 --> 02:34:23,070
through that place.
Last night,

3699
02:34:23,070 --> 02:34:27,690
every room was sold out.
There's not a club like that on the 

3700
02:34:27,690 --> 02:34:27,690
planet or.
Nope.

3701
02:34:27,690 --> 02:34:27,690
Doesn't exist.
Well,

3702
02:34:27,690 --> 02:34:29,610
that's what the dude runs.
The social media was saying last night.

3703
02:34:29,630 --> 02:34:34,630
He was like,
you gotta understand like just for 

3704
02:34:34,630 --> 02:34:34,630
laughs is going on right now.
This has a way better lineup.

3705
02:34:34,630 --> 02:34:39,250
Yeah,
and when just for laughs used to go on 

3706
02:34:39,250 --> 02:34:39,890
at the store,
it was like ghost towns,

3707
02:34:39,920 --> 02:34:40,910
ghost town.
It was like no,

3708
02:34:40,911 --> 02:34:43,370
comics were in town anymore.
Audience people weren't even coming out.

3709
02:34:43,640 --> 02:34:45,440
Now just relapse.
You wouldn't even know what's happening.

3710
02:34:45,890 --> 02:34:48,260
There's still so many bangers in town.
It doesn't even fucking matter.

3711
02:34:48,290 --> 02:34:48,680
It's just

3712
02:34:48,960 --> 02:34:51,360
weird time.
Weird time for standup.

3713
02:34:51,361 --> 02:34:54,370
Best time it's popping.
Would you know,

3714
02:34:54,390 --> 02:34:56,700
I wonder what is the.
I mean there's so many different.

3715
02:34:56,701 --> 02:34:58,890
It's so you can't really have one 
factor.

3716
02:34:58,891 --> 02:35:01,160
There's not just one factor,
but these,

3717
02:35:01,200 --> 02:35:03,930
the Internet for sure is the underlying 
machines,

3718
02:35:03,931 --> 02:35:08,931
like more people have access to standup 
comedy through youtube and all these 

3719
02:35:08,931 --> 02:35:12,291
other different ways.
Netflix and then on top of that it's 

3720
02:35:12,291 --> 02:35:13,110
podcast,
like comics get together and people.

3721
02:35:13,111 --> 02:35:17,430
Those podcasts become a part of people's
lives daily live their drive and then on

3722
02:35:17,431 --> 02:35:20,280
top of that that podcasts are talking 
about the store.

3723
02:35:20,430 --> 02:35:25,430
Like everyone's talked the store,
the store was taught and that because 

3724
02:35:25,430 --> 02:35:25,430
you go to the laugh factory tonight.

3725
02:35:26,800 --> 02:35:28,870
Yeah,
you hear crickets.

3726
02:35:29,410 --> 02:35:34,410
Tumbleweeds.
It's just different because the laugh 

3727
02:35:34,410 --> 02:35:37,721
factory doesn't have the same kind of 
talk that comics talk about the store.

3728
02:35:37,880 --> 02:35:40,250
The store is romanticized by Comedians.
It's just like that.

3729
02:35:40,280 --> 02:35:41,210
It's that spot.
I mean,

3730
02:35:41,211 --> 02:35:42,280
Shit,
when you look at the Echo,

3731
02:35:42,290 --> 02:35:43,610
look at the instagram for the comedy 
store.

3732
02:35:43,640 --> 02:35:46,610
Every time they put a lineup,
read almost every single comment.

3733
02:35:46,611 --> 02:35:48,290
We'll have someone go,
fuck man,

3734
02:35:48,440 --> 02:35:50,880
I wish I didn't live in Xyz.
I would kill to be there.

3735
02:35:50,890 --> 02:35:53,000
It's crazy and it's Wednesday.
It's Wednesday night,

3736
02:35:53,240 --> 02:35:54,260
Thursday night,
and they're like,

3737
02:35:54,500 --> 02:35:56,090
dude,
if I could fucking pay for a flight,

3738
02:35:56,210 --> 02:35:57,800
I would do it right now.
If I could afford it,

3739
02:35:58,000 --> 02:36:00,550
kill.
We have this virtual reality thing.

3740
02:36:00,551 --> 02:36:05,551
The htc vive.
You put the headphones on and you ever 

3741
02:36:05,551 --> 02:36:05,551
seen that?
Yeah,

3742
02:36:05,551 --> 02:36:06,280
it headset.
You put the goggles on earplug.

3743
02:36:06,850 --> 02:36:08,470
They're going to do standup in that 
thing.

3744
02:36:08,500 --> 02:36:09,610
One hundred percent,
100 percent.

3745
02:36:09,640 --> 02:36:11,680
There's no doubt.
But in thinking about that a lot lately,

3746
02:36:11,710 --> 02:36:14,440
when you put that fucker on and you feel
like you're in the room with that,

3747
02:36:14,770 --> 02:36:18,880
like that would be an amazing way to 
broadcast.

3748
02:36:18,881 --> 02:36:20,740
Stand up into your living room.
Fuck,

3749
02:36:20,741 --> 02:36:22,630
yeah,
you could be at the store,

3750
02:36:23,490 --> 02:36:25,060
on your fucking couch.
Just standing up.

3751
02:36:25,061 --> 02:36:29,050
Might even be better.
It might be kind of cooler than actually

3752
02:36:29,051 --> 02:36:34,051
be in there.
Not Cool will be in there now being 

3753
02:36:34,051 --> 02:36:35,290
there's always going to be cooler,
but cool in a unique different way.

3754
02:36:35,410 --> 02:36:35,800
Well,
it's an.

3755
02:36:35,830 --> 02:36:37,300
I think it's just another ad,
right?

3756
02:36:37,301 --> 02:36:42,301
Like to me you're always gonna want live
performance because we always have in 

3757
02:36:42,301 --> 02:36:45,301
the history of humanity,
we love watching performance live and 

3758
02:36:45,301 --> 02:36:49,090
that's just another way for people to 
access who physically can't get there.

3759
02:36:49,900 --> 02:36:54,900
It's always going to be sexier to be 
there because you feel like you're a 

3760
02:36:54,900 --> 02:36:57,511
part of it.
But to actually be someone in there in 

3761
02:36:57,511 --> 02:36:59,701
the virtual world that will be justice.
I mean for people that can't physically 

3762
02:36:59,701 --> 02:36:59,701
be here,
I think that's just,

3763
02:36:59,701 --> 02:37:04,650
that's the closest you can get.
That's the best you can get when you're 

3764
02:37:04,650 --> 02:37:04,650
there.
It's live,

3765
02:37:04,650 --> 02:37:05,440
you know,
it's just a different kind of thing.

3766
02:37:05,770 --> 02:37:07,390
No,
stand up to me on tape.

3767
02:37:07,391 --> 02:37:08,770
Has ever been as funny as it is live?

3768
02:37:08,850 --> 02:37:09,450
No,
no,

3769
02:37:09,470 --> 02:37:09,730
no,
no.

3770
02:37:09,960 --> 02:37:13,690
Not even close you the best you can hope
on a television show,

3771
02:37:13,700 --> 02:37:16,160
so it's just kind of capture a feel

3772
02:37:16,160 --> 02:37:21,160
of it.
When you're doing a special for 

3773
02:37:21,160 --> 02:37:23,111
television,
what is this is as close as they are 

3774
02:37:23,111 --> 02:37:23,111
getting right now.
Holy Shit.

3775
02:37:23,111 --> 02:37:26,950
This is like a virtual audience and like
a almost like fake movie theater type 

3776
02:37:26,950 --> 02:37:28,550
situation and you're all watching the 
screen together.

3777
02:37:28,960 --> 02:37:31,610
You can look around and see people and 
you watching the World Cup.

3778
02:37:31,640 --> 02:37:35,310
This was for the World Cup.
Well to start with what sets?

3779
02:37:35,630 --> 02:37:40,340
So you sit down and you feel like you're
in awesome seats at the World Cup.

3780
02:37:41,720 --> 02:37:46,720
This happening at the same time that a 
couple of websites are starting with 

3781
02:37:46,720 --> 02:37:46,910
their calling.
Watch parties where you watch videos?

3782
02:37:46,920 --> 02:37:51,920
No,
my friends together online at the same 

3783
02:37:51,920 --> 02:37:51,920
time.
This is the actual World Cup.

3784
02:37:51,920 --> 02:37:56,170
This was for the World Cup.
So you actually watched the real game 

3785
02:37:56,170 --> 02:38:00,160
with those goggles on and you're fucking
in the third row.

3786
02:38:00,440 --> 02:38:04,880
Look how good that looks to and then 
look at the hard rock ad so they can put

3787
02:38:04,881 --> 02:38:05,450
ads up.

3788
02:38:05,660 --> 02:38:10,660
Well,
that's where they're going to start 

3789
02:38:10,660 --> 02:38:10,660
making all their money.
Damn,

3790
02:38:10,660 --> 02:38:10,660
that looks amazing because like,
you know,

3791
02:38:10,660 --> 02:38:10,660
you've seen it.
A lot of sporting events.

3792
02:38:10,660 --> 02:38:13,880
They use green screen on their ads girls
so that they can change for television.

3793
02:38:14,120 --> 02:38:15,620
I mean that'll just be that.
It'd be the same thing,

3794
02:38:15,650 --> 02:38:17,750
dude.
How dope would that be for UFC fights?

3795
02:38:17,810 --> 02:38:21,740
Fuck the HTC vive one wasn't the UFC do 
that.

3796
02:38:22,340 --> 02:38:27,340
Call them up.
They do do experimental things all the 

3797
02:38:27,340 --> 02:38:27,340
time.
Right?

3798
02:38:27,340 --> 02:38:27,920
That they try out and then they don't 
always use them.

3799
02:38:28,080 --> 02:38:28,870
Yes.
Yes,

3800
02:38:29,050 --> 02:38:32,240
but that seems like the best one with 
those guys on.

3801
02:38:32,241 --> 02:38:37,241
And that way you could be in the cage.
You put a camera on the fucking guy who 

3802
02:38:37,241 --> 02:38:40,801
was a referee,
the ref ref cam to shoulder camps and 

3803
02:38:40,801 --> 02:38:44,090
some hip cams put cameras all over him.
Cam circling him a camera.

3804
02:38:44,930 --> 02:38:49,590
Make the fucking ref cameras to do that 
in pride and pride to Gopro and Gopros.

3805
02:38:49,670 --> 02:38:51,620
Yeah,
and you'd be able to see it from the Ref

3806
02:38:51,620 --> 02:38:52,820
Cam,
but those are just shit.

3807
02:38:52,821 --> 02:38:55,640
You'd have to get really good cameras.
They used to be shitty.

3808
02:38:55,641 --> 02:38:58,820
They're pretty God damn good now for Vr,
they got to be really good cameras.

3809
02:38:58,821 --> 02:38:59,840
Right?
Don't take Gopros.

3810
02:38:59,870 --> 02:39:00,710
They can get it now.
It's.

3811
02:39:00,770 --> 02:39:01,430
I mean,
yeah,

3812
02:39:01,670 --> 02:39:04,250
I think they could probably could do it.
I bet someone could pull this,

3813
02:39:04,251 --> 02:39:06,910
our gopros always with that fish 
islands.

3814
02:39:07,050 --> 02:39:07,610
Sort of.
Yeah.

3815
02:39:07,611 --> 02:39:09,770
You got to use some software to.
To not have that,

3816
02:39:09,771 --> 02:39:11,160
if you will,
because they're built like that.

3817
02:39:11,270 --> 02:39:14,000
They're built with the fish eye on.
Why do they do that?

3818
02:39:14,001 --> 02:39:15,960
Just for perspective angle field of 
view,

3819
02:39:16,310 --> 02:39:21,310
because it's because it was originally 
intended for extreme sports and so that 

3820
02:39:21,310 --> 02:39:22,340
that's always the best view in every.

3821
02:39:22,520 --> 02:39:24,440
Every extreme sport is the fish.
I looked great.

3822
02:39:24,500 --> 02:39:27,090
I think you're trying to recreate your 
eyes like you have a,

3823
02:39:27,420 --> 02:39:29,750
you know you have 180 degree or probably
more than that,

3824
02:39:29,760 --> 02:39:31,820
but it's not all just stored it.
That's the problem.

3825
02:39:31,821 --> 02:39:34,850
Everything's gets all stretched out and 
weird at the edge of class.

3826
02:39:34,851 --> 02:39:37,490
I don't think anyone's figured out that 
yet too hard,

3827
02:39:37,540 --> 02:39:38,670
you know,
but that's why the.

3828
02:39:38,690 --> 02:39:43,690
That's why they're like that.
Like what four K is is inching towards 

3829
02:39:43,690 --> 02:39:43,690
live,
live,

3830
02:39:43,690 --> 02:39:47,890
live broadcast in four k is crazy.
They say four k is more clear than the 

3831
02:39:47,890 --> 02:39:52,181
human eye.
Can see there's elements to it that are 

3832
02:39:52,181 --> 02:39:52,181
clearer than what human I can actually 
see.

3833
02:39:52,181 --> 02:39:53,360
And they're going higher than 14.
Yeah man.

3834
02:39:53,510 --> 02:39:55,290
What are they doing now?
Are they doing something?

3835
02:39:55,340 --> 02:40:00,340
Eight k cameras.
What is that camera that you're getting 

3836
02:40:00,340 --> 02:40:01,430
that phone with?
The red phone.

3837
02:40:01,800 --> 02:40:03,020
The red got.
Damn.

3838
02:40:03,021 --> 02:40:04,560
I always forget the name of it,
but it's a reds.

3839
02:40:04,670 --> 02:40:06,760
So it's a cell phone.
Like with the red,

3840
02:40:06,761 --> 02:40:08,960
the camera,
the Red Technology Company read,

3841
02:40:08,961 --> 02:40:11,720
made a phone and explained.
Read that.

3842
02:40:11,721 --> 02:40:14,280
It's like a super high end camera.
They ferry fees with

3843
02:40:14,330 --> 02:40:15,500
just for all high end things.
They,

3844
02:40:15,560 --> 02:40:18,540
I think they based started like $20,000
or something like that.

3845
02:40:18,541 --> 02:40:20,010
That's just,
that's not even the lens.

3846
02:40:20,040 --> 02:40:22,250
That's just the physical fucking camera 
itself.

3847
02:40:22,280 --> 02:40:23,700
Yeah.
The bulk of $5,000.

3848
02:40:23,701 --> 02:40:25,800
Battery or not really but.
So it gets really expensive.

3849
02:40:25,801 --> 02:40:28,020
But anyway.
So this is supposed to be like a modular

3850
02:40:28,021 --> 02:40:31,380
piece that's supposed to work with some 
systems they have coming in the future.

3851
02:40:31,880 --> 02:40:36,880
This like the base of the,
of the phone might connect to a camera 

3852
02:40:36,880 --> 02:40:38,250
or my connect to a series of other 
things it might replace.

3853
02:40:38,760 --> 02:40:40,920
Um,
I think they actually said that says two

3854
02:40:40,921 --> 02:40:42,030
cameras on the back.
So anyway,

3855
02:40:42,031 --> 02:40:44,790
the other cool part of it is the display
is holographic,

3856
02:40:44,820 --> 02:40:49,820
which no one's actually seen yet because
it's a new technology like playback can 

3857
02:40:49,951 --> 02:40:54,951
be in the warrant.
They supposed to release his phone over 

3858
02:40:54,951 --> 02:40:54,951
a year ago.

3859
02:40:54,951 --> 02:40:55,290
They showed it a year ago.
And when did you buy it then?

3860
02:40:55,291 --> 02:40:58,880
On preorder?
I think I bought it last about a year.

3861
02:40:58,920 --> 02:41:00,250
What do they clip you for?
How much we're,

3862
02:41:00,251 --> 02:41:03,450
that's the same price as a iphone and 
the 1200 bucks I just had to prepay it,

3863
02:41:04,200 --> 02:41:07,920
get 1200 bucks so they can advance the 
technology they needed.

3864
02:41:07,921 --> 02:41:09,000
The money I imagined.
So yeah,

3865
02:41:09,030 --> 02:41:11,130
we all paid for.
I think so,

3866
02:41:11,131 --> 02:41:13,110
yeah.
And then just trusting read because it's

3867
02:41:13,111 --> 02:41:13,710
not,
you know,

3868
02:41:13,840 --> 02:41:16,590
it's a fly by night,
but they're also getting,

3869
02:41:16,650 --> 02:41:21,630
I'm sure tons of a VC investors to keep 
pumping money to keep that going.

3870
02:41:22,100 --> 02:41:25,880
That's the kind of thing that the 
technology is so far ahead,

3871
02:41:25,900 --> 02:41:28,470
they're trying hard to get the hardware 
to a place where it works.

3872
02:41:28,480 --> 02:41:31,770
And when is this supposed to come out?
I'm supposed to be shipped next month.

3873
02:41:31,800 --> 02:41:34,920
So in the next four weeks have some 
people.

3874
02:41:35,150 --> 02:41:37,830
There might be the testers out.
Imagine some magical day,

3875
02:41:37,831 --> 02:41:40,050
like they're not going to tell you,
but like August eighth for instance.

3876
02:41:40,420 --> 02:41:45,420
Well August,
August ninth is when the Samsung Galaxy 

3877
02:41:45,420 --> 02:41:49,191
note nine comes in matching.
That's probably gonna come up with 

3878
02:41:49,191 --> 02:41:51,590
similar ads coming out.
Now apparently it's going to have the 

3879
02:41:51,590 --> 02:41:51,590
most storage of any phone.
The biggest battery,

3880
02:41:51,590 --> 02:41:52,350
it's going to $4,000,
million amp battery.

3881
02:41:52,351 --> 02:41:57,351
It's going to have insane cameras.
This is Samsung's last hurrah with the 

3882
02:41:57,901 --> 02:42:00,120
note and the note doesn't work this 
time.

3883
02:42:00,121 --> 02:42:05,121
They're just gonna stick with the 
galaxies because the galaxy s nine did 

3884
02:42:05,121 --> 02:42:05,250
not do well.
It didn't sell well,

3885
02:42:05,251 --> 02:42:08,460
but it was an amazing phone,
but it was too close to the galaxy.

3886
02:42:08,461 --> 02:42:09,990
S eight.
It wasn't much different.

3887
02:42:09,991 --> 02:42:13,050
It was just like a.
An incremental step better as opposed to

3888
02:42:13,051 --> 02:42:17,820
like the iphone 10 is kind of way better
than the iphone seven,

3889
02:42:17,870 --> 02:42:18,990
you know,
the seven and eight.

3890
02:42:19,290 --> 02:42:24,290
It's just like the shape is better.
The fact that all it has is this little 

3891
02:42:24,290 --> 02:42:26,070
tiny little notch at the top.
It's all screen.

3892
02:42:26,310 --> 02:42:27,270
It's pretty dope.
Camera.

3893
02:42:27,271 --> 02:42:28,920
I don't know who I was.
I don't know who was talking about it.

3894
02:42:28,921 --> 02:42:30,510
I think it would maybe be a comic,
but they were like,

3895
02:42:30,511 --> 02:42:31,920
man,
if Steve Jobs was alive,

3896
02:42:32,220 --> 02:42:34,050
that would have never been up there that
notch.

3897
02:42:35,490 --> 02:42:40,490
He was such a meticulous fucking dude.
Weiwei has an amazing phone called the 

3898
02:42:41,101 --> 02:42:46,101
mate are or the [inaudible] pro.
This is the always the company that 

3899
02:42:46,101 --> 02:42:47,580
trump is keeping from selling cell 
phones.

3900
02:42:47,581 --> 02:42:48,720
Oh yes.
States.

3901
02:42:48,840 --> 02:42:51,210
And there was an article here.
I'll send it to Jamie.

3902
02:42:51,390 --> 02:42:56,390
There was an article that we were 
talking about this yesterday with Dr 

3903
02:42:56,390 --> 02:42:56,390
Deborah.
So.

3904
02:42:56,390 --> 02:43:01,340
And then there's an article on a,
I think it's on bg are here,

3905
02:43:01,621 --> 02:43:03,810
I'll send you this right now.

3906
02:43:04,020 --> 02:43:09,020
But they were saying there's no reason 
why they shouldn't have this phone for 

3907
02:43:09,020 --> 02:43:13,101
sale.
Like there's some fucking weirdness 

3908
02:43:13,101 --> 02:43:13,101
going on.
But this,

3909
02:43:13,101 --> 02:43:14,110
um,
this one,

3910
02:43:14,350 --> 02:43:16,960
uh,
porsche design made their own version of

3911
02:43:16,961 --> 02:43:21,520
it.
Porsche design made a mate 10 rs.

3912
02:43:21,700 --> 02:43:23,810
They caught like rally sport,
like their cars,

3913
02:43:23,820 --> 02:43:27,790
the cars like my gt three Rs.
And they,

3914
02:43:27,850 --> 02:43:29,490
um,
they took away the notch,

3915
02:43:29,520 --> 02:43:34,520
like fuck that notch.
Like we're just going to have a thin 

3916
02:43:34,520 --> 02:43:34,520
bezel on the top.
And then one on the bottom,

3917
02:43:34,520 --> 02:43:36,370
you can't have a notch.
No Porsche designs.

3918
02:43:36,371 --> 02:43:36,700
Like,
nope,

3919
02:43:36,820 --> 02:43:37,180
no,
no,

3920
02:43:37,181 --> 02:43:42,181
fuck that fucking nuts.
But that's what I feel about what that 

3921
02:43:42,181 --> 02:43:42,181
guy.
I got mad at a guy at apple and I said,

3922
02:43:42,181 --> 02:43:46,800
I said they fucked me over on an 
appointment or something that was being 

3923
02:43:46,800 --> 02:43:46,800
a dick.
And I go,

3924
02:43:46,800 --> 02:43:46,800
you know,
if that guy was alive,

3925
02:43:46,800 --> 02:43:47,230
this company will still be doing better.

3926
02:43:47,470 --> 02:43:48,580
And he was like,
okay,

3927
02:43:48,581 --> 02:43:49,690
that's me.
And I was like,

3928
02:43:49,691 --> 02:43:51,310
I'm just saying,
I mean,

3929
02:43:51,320 --> 02:43:53,110
yeah,
they took a tank when that guy died.

3930
02:43:53,120 --> 02:43:56,530
It's definitely gone.
So down to laptops are dog shit,

3931
02:43:56,531 --> 02:43:58,120
dog shit.
They're so bad.

3932
02:43:58,140 --> 02:44:03,140
They're beaten.
They're getting class action lawsuits 

3933
02:44:03,140 --> 02:44:04,180
about the keyboards fucking up new small
smartphone.

3934
02:44:04,181 --> 02:44:07,450
Trump tried to ban drop to its lowest 
price ever on Amazon.

3935
02:44:07,600 --> 02:44:12,600
But this is the problem is it's the best
camera in any smartphone is three 

3936
02:44:12,600 --> 02:44:14,710
cameras on the back.
It's fucking amazing.

3937
02:44:14,711 --> 02:44:16,960
40 megapixel camera.
Holy Shit.

3938
02:44:16,990 --> 02:44:21,990
But the problem is it won't work on all 
bands in the United States because it's 

3939
02:44:22,961 --> 02:44:24,540
European design.
It's not,

3940
02:44:24,640 --> 02:44:28,420
it's not built for this and it's only,
it's only gsm.

3941
02:44:28,421 --> 02:44:33,421
So you have to use it on a and t or t 
mobile 10 by one by one for 800 bucks.

3942
02:44:34,450 --> 02:44:37,240
But it's supposed to be the fucking shit
and the,

3943
02:44:37,270 --> 02:44:38,430
the screens.

3944
02:44:38,440 --> 02:44:43,440
Amazing.
You've got to be able to jailbreak and 

3945
02:44:43,440 --> 02:44:43,440
manipulate those films and make them 
easier to,

3946
02:44:43,440 --> 02:44:46,681
you know,
because they're not designed for the 

3947
02:44:46,681 --> 02:44:46,681
same bands.
He says right there,

3948
02:44:46,681 --> 02:44:48,490
you could buy it right now.
Seven hundred 95 bucks.

3949
02:44:49,150 --> 02:44:51,430
But the thing is,
it's just,

3950
02:44:51,431 --> 02:44:55,570
I don't think it works exactly the same.
I think if you have an at and t phone.

3951
02:44:55,600 --> 02:44:57,250
Let's see.
That's a SIM factory unlocked.

3952
02:44:57,280 --> 02:44:59,770
So you can use any international Sim Sim
on those.

3953
02:45:00,040 --> 02:45:03,250
Yeah,
but the problem is the radio,

3954
02:45:03,251 --> 02:45:05,890
the frequencies that it picks up,
it doesn't pick up the same.

3955
02:45:05,950 --> 02:45:10,950
All the same bands.
It's like 18 t or t mobile has does not 

3956
02:45:10,950 --> 02:45:12,250
work with sprint,
verizon,

3957
02:45:12,251 --> 02:45:17,251
US cellular and other cma cameras.
Those are cdma because it's a GSM phone.

3958
02:45:18,280 --> 02:45:22,380
But the thing they're saying is that 
even if you get a GSM network like t and

3959
02:45:22,390 --> 02:45:27,390
t or I'm going to have to ask one of the
dudes that I know like Lewis from unbox 

3960
02:45:27,390 --> 02:45:31,630
therapy or a flossy Carter,
those guys that do those videos,

3961
02:45:31,930 --> 02:45:32,530
they would know.

3962
02:45:32,650 --> 02:45:37,650
40 megapixel camera for my first digital
camera that I ever had was like five.

3963
02:45:37,930 --> 02:45:40,390
I think mine was one thing that I was 
like,

3964
02:45:40,391 --> 02:45:41,630
that's fucking bad.
I was.

3965
02:45:41,950 --> 02:45:43,600
It was bullet,
but back then I remember being like,

3966
02:45:43,730 --> 02:45:45,820
Christmas,
look at these fucking Christmas photos.

3967
02:45:45,940 --> 02:45:49,360
That point I was trying to make us sit 
with the Wifi like that without making a

3968
02:45:49,361 --> 02:45:54,361
phone call and dialing the numbers.
There are so many other ways you could 

3969
02:45:54,361 --> 02:45:58,111
communicate with the people you need to 
communicate with and still make a phone 

3970
02:45:58,111 --> 02:45:58,111
call.
Yeah,

3971
02:45:59,620 --> 02:46:04,180
that point's not valid because the 
places where you can use that Wifi,

3972
02:46:04,510 --> 02:46:06,850
you also get signaled that you could use
that phone on.

3973
02:46:07,120 --> 02:46:09,560
The real issue is in the places where 
signal sketchy.

3974
02:46:09,770 --> 02:46:10,010
Like

3975
02:46:10,010 --> 02:46:15,010
weird rural areas from Mississippi 
tweeted me and said he's been doing it 

3976
02:46:15,010 --> 02:46:16,890
for years so he has no cell service or 
Wifi,

3977
02:46:17,130 --> 02:46:19,190
Wifi phone.
He gets around.

3978
02:46:19,191 --> 02:46:24,191
He's like are you could probably do it 
better and larger cities than I do in 

3979
02:46:24,191 --> 02:46:24,191
Mississippi,
but I've been doing it for a long time.

3980
02:46:24,191 --> 02:46:28,620
Right.
But so he's going off of like starbucks 

3981
02:46:28,620 --> 02:46:29,300
sell Wifi or what's he doing?
Or your house or like all the places you

3982
02:46:29,301 --> 02:46:30,560
go to.
I did that in Japan,

3983
02:46:30,561 --> 02:46:33,620
but when you're in your car driving down
a rural road,

3984
02:46:33,621 --> 02:46:35,480
this is the point.
You're not going to get a service.

3985
02:46:35,481 --> 02:46:40,481
Nope.
You're not going to get Wifi and you're 

3986
02:46:40,481 --> 02:46:41,060
not going to get cell phone service,
but with a t and t or t mobile,

3987
02:46:41,090 --> 02:46:43,850
they would have some service in these 
weird areas.

3988
02:46:44,090 --> 02:46:46,820
That's the only place where these phones
to be a problem is the weird areas.

3989
02:46:47,270 --> 02:46:49,820
Spots in la it would work fine.
Yeah.

3990
02:46:50,210 --> 02:46:52,470
Yeah,
and those weird areas than like that.

3991
02:46:52,580 --> 02:46:57,580
There's more problems than just not 
being able to connect to beans in a 

3992
02:46:57,580 --> 02:46:57,580
weird area.
Exactly.

3993
02:46:57,580 --> 02:46:58,250
See you there,
Bro.

3994
02:46:58,490 --> 02:46:59,670
Maybe you're hunting.
You know,

3995
02:47:00,160 --> 02:47:05,160
put your phone away.
They're looking for fucking looking for 

3996
02:47:05,160 --> 02:47:05,160
pussy.
Looking for forest.

3997
02:47:05,180 --> 02:47:06,700
I'll look for obscure.
Pushy.

3998
02:47:07,100 --> 02:47:12,100
I don't like pussy.
Were low density environments like 

3999
02:47:12,100 --> 02:47:12,950
kitchen.
Gayle out.

4000
02:47:12,951 --> 02:47:15,380
Camping her up.
Anita come.

4001
02:47:15,590 --> 02:47:18,140
No.
Bring them a poetry.

4002
02:47:18,980 --> 02:47:21,530
Forced her to listen.
Can I read you something?

4003
02:47:22,100 --> 02:47:23,180
Oh,
it was that the worst.

4004
02:47:23,690 --> 02:47:25,700
Somebody wanted to read you their 
poetry.

4005
02:47:25,701 --> 02:47:30,701
That might be the worst thing other than
I want you to listen to my music and 

4006
02:47:30,701 --> 02:47:30,701
have a seat.
No.

4007
02:47:30,701 --> 02:47:32,340
Play my music for you.
Nah.

4008
02:47:33,170 --> 02:47:34,760
I'm going to jump out the window of this
place.

4009
02:47:34,940 --> 02:47:37,190
Not even play the music,
but play a recording.

4010
02:47:38,440 --> 02:47:39,920
You listened to my shit.
You listen,

4011
02:47:40,010 --> 02:47:42,060
you're going to put this record on this 
record.

4012
02:47:42,090 --> 02:47:43,280
I got to go.
Where's your bathroom?

4013
02:47:43,281 --> 02:47:45,230
I'm leaving now.
Fuck out.

4014
02:47:45,231 --> 02:47:46,370
I did that.
That's really funny.

4015
02:47:46,371 --> 02:47:47,900
There's a.
This is my buddy and I.

4016
02:47:48,200 --> 02:47:53,200
We got into.
We got kicked out of a party for being 

4017
02:47:53,200 --> 02:47:55,391
fucking rude and obnoxious and this 
famous chick took us back to her place 

4018
02:47:55,391 --> 02:47:57,620
with her boyfriend and we're all hanging
out and he's like,

4019
02:47:57,621 --> 02:47:59,870
dude,
let me put on my shit now.

4020
02:47:59,930 --> 02:48:01,520
I'm not kidding.
He's playing his music.

4021
02:48:01,521 --> 02:48:06,521
My Buddy's looking at me like,
how are we going to get the fuck out of 

4022
02:48:06,521 --> 02:48:06,521
here?
I go,

4023
02:48:06,521 --> 02:48:06,521
I got to go to the bathroom,
went to the bathroom,

4024
02:48:06,521 --> 02:48:06,830
left my buddy there.

4025
02:48:08,430 --> 02:48:10,090
Did.
I did.

4026
02:48:10,110 --> 02:48:10,500
I was like,
I'm not.

4027
02:48:10,501 --> 02:48:13,020
Listen to this bullshit.
I don't care if they're fucking famous.

4028
02:48:13,021 --> 02:48:14,340
I'm out.
I went home.

4029
02:48:14,341 --> 02:48:19,341
If you did that to me,
I would cry laughing if you left me in 

4030
02:48:19,341 --> 02:48:19,420
the living room and they were like,
where's Andrew?

4031
02:48:19,430 --> 02:48:23,850
I'd be like,
did he texted me like six times.

4032
02:48:23,860 --> 02:48:24,810
I didn't respond.
I was like,

4033
02:48:24,811 --> 02:48:26,550
no,
I will be howling left.

4034
02:48:27,060 --> 02:48:31,480
That motherfucker left me because you've
put on that music bullshit as you put it

4035
02:48:31,490 --> 02:48:32,270
on the music.
Hey,

4036
02:48:32,271 --> 02:48:35,730
I think the music's great,
but Andrew like throw me under the bus.

4037
02:48:35,731 --> 02:48:38,190
He's a big music fan.
He doesn't like that Shit and handle it.

4038
02:48:39,850 --> 02:48:41,080
All right,
let's,

4039
02:48:41,190 --> 02:48:46,190
let's bring this bitch home.
Andrew Santina will be with me Saturday 

4040
02:48:46,190 --> 02:48:48,570
night in Temecula all day,
but Django casino two shows.

4041
02:48:48,630 --> 02:48:50,670
Sold the fuck out.
Sold out hard

4042
02:48:51,220 --> 02:48:53,230

Come see me in Philly.

4043
02:48:53,231 --> 02:48:55,660
If you're out in Philly,
come see me next weekend.

4044
02:48:55,710 --> 02:49:00,640
We had a good God damn time the Chicago 
Theater to Kansas City and St Louis.

4045
02:49:01,280 --> 02:49:04,390
Let's go.

4046
02:49:04,391 --> 02:49:07,520
St Louis is something other than August 
10th the next day.

4047
02:49:07,550 --> 02:49:08,690
Figure it out,

Bye.
