1
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:06,260
Four three,
two,

2
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:07,603
one.

3
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:10,000
Mr. Baker,
our ancestor.

4
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:10,880
Real good.
I'm doing well.

5
00:00:10,881 --> 00:00:12,110
Thanks for [inaudible].
What's going on,

6
00:00:12,111 --> 00:00:13,130
man?
What are you doing in town?

7
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:14,480
Uh,
just,

8
00:00:14,481 --> 00:00:15,314
uh,
was in town,

9
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:15,950
one of the,
uh,

10
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:16,520
some,
uh,

11
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:19,610
work on a sizzle reel for a show,
a new show.

12
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:21,830
Can you talk about that?
You tell people what it is?

13
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:22,693
Well,
it's actually two of them are one I can 

14
00:00:23,541 --> 00:00:24,920
talk about.
I can tease it a little bit.

15
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:25,813
Um,
the marketing department I guess has to 

16
00:00:27,651 --> 00:00:29,640
approve everything that's said.
Um,

17
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:30,883
it started out,
it's going to be on the discovery 

18
00:00:31,641 --> 00:00:32,474
network,
I think a science channel and it was 

19
00:00:34,791 --> 00:00:35,624
starting to main filming in February and
we'll should be finished by the end of 

20
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:40,280
March.
So standby.

21
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:42,800
But it's started with a discussion 
about,

22
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:44,083
um,
hidden budgets in the Defense 

23
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:47,240
Department.
Like dark art stuff.

24
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:47,960
Yeah,
it's good.

25
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,370
The show's going to be called black 
files.

26
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:52,310
Ah,
and the UFO type shit.

27
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:53,720
Well,
there's gonna be some of that,

28
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:54,441
a song,
but,

29
00:00:54,441 --> 00:00:55,730
but from a,
you know,

30
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:57,700
not from a,
you know,

31
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:59,330
did they lie land,
did they not?

32
00:00:59,331 --> 00:00:59,990
It's,
it's,

33
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:01,820
well really actually kind of tearing 
into,

34
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:02,903
uh,
some of the programs that were funded 

35
00:01:04,311 --> 00:01:05,220
by,
you know,

36
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:06,650
hidden money,
uh,

37
00:01:06,651 --> 00:01:09,170
in the Defense Department.
And do they do that?

38
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:10,063
Well,
I mean if you take like the CIA for 

39
00:01:11,511 --> 00:01:12,760
example,
uh,

40
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:15,440
the agency's budget is hidden inside.
It's not hidden,

41
00:01:15,441 --> 00:01:17,360
but it's placed inside the Defense 
Department and it's,

42
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:19,640
and it's classified piece of information
obviously.

43
00:01:19,641 --> 00:01:22,250
Cause a lot of the defense department 
gets a certain budget.

44
00:01:22,251 --> 00:01:25,670
The CIA gets a piece of that,
but nobody's allowed to know how much or

45
00:01:25,671 --> 00:01:26,810
where it's spent.
Right.

46
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,190
Cause obviously,
you know,

47
00:01:28,191 --> 00:01:29,210
the Russians,
the Chinese,

48
00:01:29,211 --> 00:01:31,010
whomever would like to know,
you know,

49
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,850
how much money is a sent over to the 
agency so that they can get a sense of a

50
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:37,040
size,
resources,

51
00:01:37,041 --> 00:01:38,240
capabilities,
that sort of thing.

52
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:40,650
Uh,
so that's where the,

53
00:01:40,651 --> 00:01:42,560
the show concept started.
You know,

54
00:01:42,561 --> 00:01:43,394
what,
what does that money spent on both in 

55
00:01:45,261 --> 00:01:46,900
the old days and now.
So it's a,

56
00:01:46,901 --> 00:01:48,320
it's,
it kind of spans,

57
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,513
you know,
historical operations and events and 

58
00:01:51,141 --> 00:01:51,974
activities and special units.
And it comes up to the present time and 

59
00:01:54,501 --> 00:01:55,100
says,
you know,

60
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:56,030
whereas,
you know,

61
00:01:56,031 --> 00:01:59,750
money being devoted now for new 
technology or new programs,

62
00:01:59,751 --> 00:02:01,070
new operations,
new intelligence,

63
00:02:01,071 --> 00:02:02,390
gathering efforts,
whatever it might be.

64
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,680
So it's,
yeah,

65
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:05,510
I think it's,
it's got a lot of promise,

66
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:06,373
you know,
hopefully people tune in and find that 

67
00:02:07,131 --> 00:02:08,360
interesting.
Uh,

68
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:10,850
well people are always curious about 
where the money goes.

69
00:02:10,851 --> 00:02:11,510
Yeah,
yeah.

70
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:13,790
And you know,
I am like,

71
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:15,320
who oversees it?
Who gets,

72
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:20,710
who gets to decide like what gets spent 
on what and how much money goes where.

73
00:02:20,841 --> 00:02:22,250
And I do actually,
no,

74
00:02:22,251 --> 00:02:23,540
I do,
that's my job.

75
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:25,460
Um,
it's a good question.

76
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:25,851
I,
you know,

77
00:02:25,851 --> 00:02:26,684
that's,
I think a lot of people would be 

78
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,630
surprised at the amount that we're 
talking about it.

79
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:31,820
And it's not just,
it's not,

80
00:02:31,821 --> 00:02:33,680
the intelligence community is also in 
the military obviously.

81
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:34,813
Um,
can you discuss the actual numbers or 

82
00:02:36,381 --> 00:02:39,530
could you discuss the numbers that they 
use to have a,

83
00:02:39,531 --> 00:02:43,730
we'll be able to discuss the numbers 
that went into past operations,

84
00:02:43,731 --> 00:02:45,020
but anything that's currently 
classified,

85
00:02:45,021 --> 00:02:45,854
obviously it's not going to touch on.
But we've been working hard and the has 

86
00:02:48,521 --> 00:02:51,800
been working very hard to get excellent 
access.

87
00:02:51,801 --> 00:02:54,560
You know,
where possible and get cooperation where

88
00:02:54,561 --> 00:02:55,670
possible.
Uh,

89
00:02:55,671 --> 00:02:57,470
it's going to be a fairly immersive 
effort.

90
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:01,480
So that's the benefit of the even 
divulging any of this information.

91
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:03,370
Like why would they cooperate?
Why wouldn't they say,

92
00:03:03,371 --> 00:03:04,240
Hey,
shut the fuck up.

93
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:04,660
Yeah.
Well,

94
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:05,001
and,
and,

95
00:03:05,001 --> 00:03:05,834
and,
and frankly they should and they have 

96
00:03:07,571 --> 00:03:11,500
and they will,
but not necessarily with the agency,

97
00:03:11,501 --> 00:03:13,060
but with other departments.

98
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:13,923
And certainly within the military 
there's some information out there 

99
00:03:17,951 --> 00:03:18,784
that's accessible.
There's some ability to get them to 

100
00:03:20,861 --> 00:03:22,420
cooperate on,
on certain,

101
00:03:22,421 --> 00:03:23,254
again,
declassified operations that just 

102
00:03:24,401 --> 00:03:26,650
haven't come to light.
I look a lot of Shit's been declassified

103
00:03:26,651 --> 00:03:29,710
over the years that's just never been 
looked at or talked about.

104
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,540
You know,
somebody maybe gets a wild hair up their

105
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:33,040
ass and this is says,
I want to look into this program.

106
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:36,130
And then they start peeling it back.
It's not that it's classified,

107
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:38,680
it's just nobody's ever bothered to dig 
into that information,

108
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:40,720
wants it is a declassified.
So,

109
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:41,763
you know,
it's,

110
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,360
it's gonna be a lot of fun.
A lot of travel,

111
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:44,243
uh,
some great people working on the 

112
00:03:44,981 --> 00:03:46,120
program.
But,

113
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,160
you know,
apparently I have to,

114
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:48,994
uh,
keep it pretty much at that until the 

115
00:03:50,681 --> 00:03:51,850
marketing department says,
okay,

116
00:03:51,851 --> 00:03:52,684
here's what you can say.
So eventually you'll be able to spill 

117
00:03:54,971 --> 00:03:56,350
the beans and tell us everything.

118
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:58,660
That's exactly.
So like if they're making something like

119
00:03:58,661 --> 00:04:00,910
the b 52,
like if they're making a stealth bomber,

120
00:04:00,911 --> 00:04:03,430
if they're making some spaceship looking
thing,

121
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:04,743
like you're talking to this insane 
amount of money in research and 

122
00:04:07,271 --> 00:04:08,104
development and the budget of these 
things and they have to keep all that 

123
00:04:10,661 --> 00:04:11,560
under wraps.
Yeah.

124
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:11,981
Shit.
Yeah.

125
00:04:11,981 --> 00:04:12,380
I mean,
look,

126
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:14,890
you go back to the old days of,
um,

127
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,910
of the youtube program.
You have to program was developed,

128
00:04:17,911 --> 00:04:19,390
it designed,
built,

129
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:22,990
maintained,
flown by the CIA all those years ago.

130
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:23,853
Right now,
that was a massive effort and a lot of 

131
00:04:26,801 --> 00:04:30,640
money and it was done under budget and 
it was done on time.

132
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:33,070
Um,
in part because I think,

133
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:33,963
you know,
things were a little bit easier back 

134
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:37,600
then and we weren't all pissing on each 
other up on Capitol Hill Been,

135
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,340
uh,
yeah,

136
00:04:39,341 --> 00:04:40,174
there's so it's,
it's,

137
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:41,163
it's programs like that that I think 
will surprise people when they find out 

138
00:04:44,171 --> 00:04:46,540
both who was running it,
who was responsible.

139
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,520
Um,
and to the degree possible,

140
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:50,980
you know,
what did it cost us and you know,

141
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:51,913
who was involved and,
and to what degree did it lead to 

142
00:04:53,561 --> 00:04:55,410
something else that we're doing now.
So anyway,

143
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:56,310
there's,
there's a lot of,

144
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:57,460
a lot of,
you know,

145
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,560
threads to pull on.
I think it should be a lot of,

146
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:00,453
a lot of fun.
So there's constantly projects that are 

147
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:07,510
in development that people,
other than the people that need to know,

148
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:10,830
the general public has no idea.
Like that's always the,

149
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:11,670
the,
the purse,

150
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:13,810
the people on the outside,
folks like myself,

151
00:05:13,811 --> 00:05:14,890
you look at the,
he'd go,

152
00:05:14,891 --> 00:05:15,611
well,
why don't we kind of,

153
00:05:15,611 --> 00:05:19,390
Shit they have that they don't tell us 
about like that's what you always want.

154
00:05:19,391 --> 00:05:21,910
Like,
what kind of invisibility cloak,

155
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:24,400
what kind of crazy,
you know,

156
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:26,590
that would be good if dark matter 
weapons,

157
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,470
what are they doing?

158
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:29,140
Yeah,
no it's it and it's,

159
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,033
it's true.
I mean you get these incredibly smart 

160
00:05:32,051 --> 00:05:34,180
people and it,
but it comes down to it.

161
00:05:34,181 --> 00:05:36,070
It's as simple as as somebody gets an 
idea,

162
00:05:36,071 --> 00:05:36,904
they're sitting around a table.
It's not unlike going out with your 

163
00:05:38,351 --> 00:05:39,184
buddies and drinking and thinking and 
I'll come with somebody comes up with 

164
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:43,180
some dumb ass idea.
The next thing you know it,

165
00:05:43,181 --> 00:05:45,700
it turns into a TV show or something.
But it's,

166
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,520
uh,
it's,

167
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,353
it's not unlike that.
A lot of smart guys sitting around a 

168
00:05:49,781 --> 00:05:51,850
table thinking,
well here's the problem.

169
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:55,150
How do we resolve it?
And the key is to do it creatively,

170
00:05:55,151 --> 00:05:55,891
right?
They come up with it.

171
00:05:55,891 --> 00:05:57,770
Cause if you get a bunch of engineers 
around a table,

172
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:58,783
you hope that they're not at all 
approaching it from the same point of 

173
00:06:00,621 --> 00:06:01,300
view.
Right?

174
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,810
It's like with an operation.
If you've got that,

175
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:05,480
you've got a high value target out there
and you've got to figure out how to get,

176
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,280
get access,
get to them.

177
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:09,890
You want ideas coming in from all 
directions,

178
00:06:09,891 --> 00:06:13,310
so you don't want it.
You don't want to squelch creativity.

179
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:14,503
And believe it or not,
I mean the Intel community and the 

180
00:06:16,611 --> 00:06:17,444
military,
they've been enormously creative over 

181
00:06:19,491 --> 00:06:20,324
the years in developing new technologies
and developing operational ideas and 

182
00:06:24,201 --> 00:06:25,034
methodologies.
So it's what we're trying to do is shed 

183
00:06:27,321 --> 00:06:28,730
some light on that.
Well,

184
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,230
I would imagine there's a certain

185
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:32,650
no amount of,
I don't want to use the word fun,

186
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:34,203
but that's really the right word.
Like some of it's gotta be fun to 

187
00:06:36,131 --> 00:06:36,964
develop this stuff and implement it and 
go out and get bad guys with it and to 

188
00:06:40,121 --> 00:06:40,954
see your project come to fruition and 
actually have a positive effect on the 

189
00:06:44,171 --> 00:06:44,680
world.

190
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,401
Absolutely.
Yeah.

191
00:06:45,401 --> 00:06:48,070
I mean if you,
it really is,

192
00:06:48,071 --> 00:06:49,750
it's,
it's that simply because you know,

193
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:51,910
an operations anyway,
you know,

194
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:53,690
you,
you engage in something out there in,

195
00:06:53,691 --> 00:06:57,490
in some place around the world,
wherever it may be.

196
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:01,330
And you know,
you realize as you're walking away that,

197
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:02,213
you know,
they're not a lot of people doing this 

198
00:07:02,681 --> 00:07:03,910
at this moment on the planet.
Right?

199
00:07:03,911 --> 00:07:04,631
I mean,
so,

200
00:07:04,631 --> 00:07:05,464
so the operational activity itself is 
enormously entertaining as long as it 

201
00:07:08,801 --> 00:07:09,910
goes right.
Uh,

202
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,133
but it's also the buildup.
It's all that homework that gets you 

203
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:13,661
there,
right?

204
00:07:13,661 --> 00:07:15,310
It's,
it's like that takedown and bin Laden.

205
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:16,383
We didn't just happen to get lucky and 
rock up on his doorstep right in the 

206
00:07:18,441 --> 00:07:19,274
bottom bud.
That was eight or nine years of fucking 

207
00:07:21,851 --> 00:07:22,930
hard work.
Right?

208
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:23,823
Heavy lifting,
chasing down countless bad leads and 

209
00:07:26,831 --> 00:07:31,750
doing enormous amounts of surveillance,
street work and tracking down assets and

210
00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:33,550
doing,
I mean just it just the hard,

211
00:07:33,551 --> 00:07:36,730
hard work that eventually allowed the,
you know,

212
00:07:36,731 --> 00:07:40,660
all those guys from the teams to land 
and do their job.

213
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,233
What's interesting to me too is that the
guy who was writing the book about all 

214
00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:46,910
this stuff and talking about,
you know,

215
00:07:46,911 --> 00:07:51,500
the man who shot bin Ladin Dot guy's 
persona non grata in the community.

216
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,230
Like you talked to the other seals,
they're like,

217
00:07:54,231 --> 00:07:56,590
you don't,
you don't do that right now.

218
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:57,810
You don't do that.
You know,

219
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,753
you don't write books about that.
You don't talk about that and do it for 

220
00:08:02,151 --> 00:08:04,040
a short term gain.
You know,

221
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:06,580
you make some profit off of it,
but you lose the brothership,

222
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:07,361
you lose a,
yeah,

223
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:08,194
exactly.
You,

224
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,333
you're,
you're kind of on the outs in the club 

225
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:12,670
and,
but I will say this,

226
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:14,860
the reason why I think,
uh,

227
00:08:14,861 --> 00:08:17,560
the Horse got out of the barn on,
on that whole issue of,

228
00:08:17,561 --> 00:08:18,394
of guys writing books or getting out 
there and talking about specific 

229
00:08:21,191 --> 00:08:26,191
operations is because senior commanders 
and end senior people,

230
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:27,363
right.
People that came out of the top levels 

231
00:08:28,301 --> 00:08:29,500
of government,
uh,

232
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:31,840
started writing their memoirs,
you know,

233
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:33,610
started revisiting history while they 
were,

234
00:08:33,611 --> 00:08:36,430
it was their watch and coming up with,
you know,

235
00:08:36,431 --> 00:08:40,990
their explanations for history.
And I think all the guys below,

236
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:44,020
you know,
junior ranks and street level operators,

237
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,160
they looked at that and thought,
well,

238
00:08:45,161 --> 00:08:46,300
what the fuck?
If they can do it,

239
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,433
why not me?
And because you've gotta set the tone 

240
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:51,040
from the top.
And I think that's where it got it.

241
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:52,540
Got All know,
kind of sideways.

242
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:56,280
Plus when you have someone who you has a
crazy

243
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:59,070
story like Marcus Luttrell and it 
becomes an amazing movie.

244
00:08:59,071 --> 00:09:02,100
It also,
it does help the community,

245
00:09:02,101 --> 00:09:02,934
right?
Because it gets a bunch of people that 

246
00:09:03,631 --> 00:09:05,520
are really interested in becoming a 
seal.

247
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:10,560
It gets people to appreciate the,
the unbelievable sacrifice and hard work

248
00:09:10,561 --> 00:09:11,394
that's involved.

249
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:12,533
Yeah.
I think that's,

250
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:14,340
I think that there is an upside,
right?

251
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,630
Yeah.
There's an upside to it,

252
00:09:15,631 --> 00:09:17,670
but I think it's a fine balance.
Right.

253
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,940
What point do you go over that line?
So you're right in the sense that,

254
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:22,203
you know,
we'd see that with a w whom have with 

255
00:09:23,851 --> 00:09:25,360
the FBI or dea,
you know,

256
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:27,690
they got out there and put their 
thumbprint on some TV shows,

257
00:09:27,691 --> 00:09:29,310
right?
Because I think it kind of,

258
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:34,620
it expanded in part a awareness of,
of what they do.

259
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:36,520
I'm sure it helped their recruitment.
Um,

260
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:39,660
and so the seals are no different.
But at the same time,

261
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,470
uh,
you know,

262
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:43,890
you sign a piece of paper at the very 
beginning that says you're going to keep

263
00:09:43,891 --> 00:09:48,891
your Yap shut and,
and it's one thing to come out with from

264
00:09:49,081 --> 00:09:52,860
whatever unit or whatever team or 
whatever organization and say,

265
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:55,470
I'm going to write a,
I don't know about my time in,

266
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:57,690
and it's not a look at sources and 
methods.

267
00:09:57,691 --> 00:10:00,180
Not Look at operations.
It's not that it's more of,

268
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:02,520
you know,
this is what happened during my time.

269
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:05,190
And I think there's,
I'm not explaining it very well,

270
00:10:05,191 --> 00:10:08,550
but I think there's a way you can do 
that without screwing the pooch.

271
00:10:08,551 --> 00:10:09,810
But I think that,
uh,

272
00:10:09,811 --> 00:10:13,610
I think the seals got overexposed and I 
think a lot of the guys,

273
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:14,940
uh,
resent that.

274
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,580
And so,
but again,

275
00:10:17,581 --> 00:10:19,200
you're right there,
there was some upsides

276
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:20,510
to it.
Well,

277
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:22,370
there's upside to some of the stores,
right?

278
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:25,880
Like I've definitely these upside to 
Marcus Luttrell store cause it's just so

279
00:10:25,881 --> 00:10:27,470
incredible.
He question here about it.

280
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:33,070
But I think that there's also,
it's important to maintain that honor.

281
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:38,870
It's a more important to maintain that,
that bond of silence,

282
00:10:38,871 --> 00:10:39,950
you know,
that you guys,

283
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:43,070
you know,
they're doing something that is probably

284
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:48,460
one of the most dangerous and one of the
most in terms of special operations,

285
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:52,580
one of the most significant in,
in,

286
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:54,860
in all of military in this country.

287
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:57,520
But yeah,
I think it's the old school guys,

288
00:10:57,521 --> 00:11:00,160
the old school operators out of the 
teams are definitely like,

289
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:00,810
yeah,
just,

290
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:01,870
you know,
shut your pie hole.

291
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:04,210
Don't talk about this,
the newer guys again,

292
00:11:04,211 --> 00:11:05,830
because they came up in a different 
time.

293
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:06,723
I mean information flows all around as 
much easier and quicker than it did in 

294
00:11:09,581 --> 00:11:12,730
the seventies and eighties and you know,
early nineties.

295
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:17,260
But nowadays people are just used to 
reading everything as soon as it happens

296
00:11:17,261 --> 00:11:19,810
and creates a different mindset.
So the younger guys in there,

297
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:22,630
they don't necessarily view it the same 
way.

298
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:26,060
Think about it until the Dick Marchenko 
books came out.

299
00:11:26,061 --> 00:11:27,860
And those were long time as long time 
ago.

300
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:29,390
Yeah.
That's when I really was like,

301
00:11:29,391 --> 00:11:31,670
wow,
I can't wear regular clothes.

302
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,710
I mean,
I mean,

303
00:11:33,711 --> 00:11:36,920
I think I was like probably 18 or 19 
when those books were out.

304
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,420
And I remember thinking,
what is,

305
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:40,940
this is crazy wear long hair.
And they dress like hippies.

306
00:11:40,941 --> 00:11:43,580
It just normal and go out and invade,

307
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:45,970
go ahead and fade.
And it's just,

308
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,760
they invading hippies,
but you know,

309
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:48,661
get,
I mean,

310
00:11:48,661 --> 00:11:52,620
Marchenko was famous for wanting his 
guys to get drunk together to before,

311
00:11:52,621 --> 00:11:54,130
like big things.
Yeah.

312
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:56,050
Well it's that,
it's that idea of team building,

313
00:11:56,051 --> 00:11:58,020
Camaraderie and however you do it.
Uh,

314
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:58,953
but there was,
there was that sense that we do it and 

315
00:12:01,931 --> 00:12:04,540
it's off the radar and it's not talked 
about.

316
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:07,060
And we take pride in that.
But again,

317
00:12:07,061 --> 00:12:08,890
I'll go back to the same thing if,
if,

318
00:12:08,891 --> 00:12:10,070
uh,
if you don't,

319
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:11,300
I'm like Bob Gates,
you know,

320
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:12,700
by gates writes a book,
you know,

321
00:12:12,701 --> 00:12:14,950
I'm a former director of the agency and 
he's a brilliant guy,

322
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:18,130
great guy.
But he writes a book and you know,

323
00:12:18,131 --> 00:12:20,530
and then you get somebody else,
maybe Mike Morrell writes a book.

324
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:21,590
And so from,
you know,

325
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:23,830
inside the CIA,
you got a lot of officers going,

326
00:12:23,831 --> 00:12:24,551
well,
she had,

327
00:12:24,551 --> 00:12:25,384
maybe when I get out I'll write a book 
because what I'm doing is pretty damn 

328
00:12:27,611 --> 00:12:29,350
interesting.
And there's no laws against that.

329
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:30,213
Well,
there,

330
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:32,350
yeah,
there are [inaudible] and you know,

331
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:33,640
anybody who,
uh,

332
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:35,650
reveal sources and methods,
anybody who,

333
00:12:35,651 --> 00:12:36,400
who,
uh,

334
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:39,880
who breaks their agreements in terms of 
the proper handling,

335
00:12:39,881 --> 00:12:42,610
which is a lifetime agreement of,
of classified information,

336
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,710
they're supposed to be consequences.

337
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:46,930
And sometimes there are,
and sometimes if you're senior enough,

338
00:12:46,931 --> 00:12:48,550
maybe there's not.
Uh,

339
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,140
but uh,
yeah,

340
00:12:50,141 --> 00:12:51,060
you,
you know,

341
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:52,720
you sign a piece of paper at the very 
beginning.

342
00:12:52,721 --> 00:12:55,000
I'll never forget that.
I read it and on it and I said,

343
00:12:55,001 --> 00:12:55,850
okay,
go ahead.

344
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:58,540
There was,
it says keep your Yap Shit.

345
00:12:58,590 --> 00:12:59,423
I mean I don't want to over simplify it,
but it says [inaudible] are being given 

346
00:13:02,651 --> 00:13:03,484
the responsibility of handling a 
extremely sensitive information and 

347
00:13:06,641 --> 00:13:07,474
information that,
that if released can easily result in 

348
00:13:10,421 --> 00:13:11,254
the loss of life.
I mean it's as simple as that 

349
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:14,013
essentially.
And your obligation is to shut your 

350
00:13:16,061 --> 00:13:16,894
mouth and not talk about sources and 
methods and things that you know better 

351
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,820
not to talk about.
And,

352
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:24,130
but I think that that kind of the drip,
drip,

353
00:13:24,131 --> 00:13:24,790
drip,
right,

354
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:26,650
of the books and the things that come 
out and the,

355
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:27,753
and the anonymous sources look at New 
York Times can write a in a tire front 

356
00:13:30,971 --> 00:13:34,690
page article based on nothing but 
anonymous sources nowadays never used to

357
00:13:34,691 --> 00:13:35,170
happen.

358
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:36,130
Right.
You know,

359
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:37,660
editors would sit there and go,
well,

360
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:38,503
you know,
you've got to get yourself some 

361
00:13:39,101 --> 00:13:43,030
additional sources and that we can 
discuss so people can put it in context.

362
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:44,170
Nowadays,
that's not the case.

363
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,180
Why do you think that is?
You know,

364
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:49,390
I think Chris,
I dunno,

365
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:53,480
we're part of it is low standards.
Yeah.

366
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,810
I think lower standards.
I think competition,

367
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:56,933
um,
I think the desire to get information 

368
00:13:58,181 --> 00:14:00,610
out there quickly because every 
journalist is now,

369
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:01,613
uh,
playing beat the clock with everybody 

370
00:14:02,681 --> 00:14:03,980
who's got a smartphone,
right?

371
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:08,530
Fancies themselves a blogger or a 
journalist on twitter or whatever.

372
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:10,600
So they're all,
they're all doing this.

373
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:13,540
And I think it's just this idea,
right?

374
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:14,540
That says,
uh,

375
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,010
it reminds me of me.
I had a meeting with,

376
00:14:18,011 --> 00:14:19,030
uh,
with,

377
00:14:19,031 --> 00:14:19,864
uh,
my company diligence for all your 

378
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:22,893
information and security needs.
And it was with a major multinational 

379
00:14:26,201 --> 00:14:27,034
corporation and I was meeting with their
head of security and some other folks 

380
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:31,533
and they do a lot of work overseas and 
some very difficult places and the 

381
00:14:34,211 --> 00:14:36,160
competition that they face in their 
sectors,

382
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,013
huge.

383
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:39,490
And so we went in there and we thought 
this would be great.

384
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:42,400
There's a lot of things we can do for 
them in terms of gathering information,

385
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:45,190
preventing them from making mistakes as 
they're going into a new market.

386
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:47,860
All of these things.
And the bottom line was they said,

387
00:14:47,861 --> 00:14:49,280
they looked at me and he said,
Nah,

388
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:51,380
you know what?
Competition's so fierce.

389
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,780
We're just going to go in.
If we make mistakes,

390
00:14:53,781 --> 00:14:56,510
we'll clean it up later.
And they were willing to do that.

391
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:57,344
It's,
it's like acceptable lost credit card 

392
00:14:58,581 --> 00:14:59,650
fraud loss,
you know,

393
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:00,493
for mastercard or whomever.
They're willing to accept millions and 

394
00:15:02,481 --> 00:15:05,280
millions and millions of dollars as an 
acceptable loss for,

395
00:15:05,281 --> 00:15:09,200
for the cost of doing business.
And so it's a little bit like that.

396
00:15:09,201 --> 00:15:10,560
I think with journalism,
they,

397
00:15:10,561 --> 00:15:13,280
they're willing to just throw shit out 
there and hey,

398
00:15:13,281 --> 00:15:14,840
if they have to make a retraction fine.

399
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:18,800
But it compromises the way a person like
myself views the news.

400
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:19,581
I mean,
look,

401
00:15:19,581 --> 00:15:21,500
I hate to quote trump,
but when he,

402
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:25,700
he's like parents that fake news term 
over and over again.

403
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:28,550
You,
if you are a person who's,

404
00:15:28,551 --> 00:15:31,580
or an organization is being accused of 
lying,

405
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:37,130
it seems to me you should really dot 
your i's and cross your t's from then on

406
00:15:37,131 --> 00:15:37,641
out.
I mean,

407
00:15:37,641 --> 00:15:38,474
you're being accused of lying by the 
president and I think irresponsibly 

408
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:43,250
accused.
I mean the way he does it,

409
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:46,070
he does it to avoid questions that make 
them uncomfortable.

410
00:15:46,071 --> 00:15:47,570
I mean,
and as the president,

411
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:49,310
I just don't think you should be able to
do that.

412
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:52,430
You can't point to someone from CNN and 
you're fake news.

413
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:53,653
Like what does it serves 12 right?
It serves no purpose for the press that 

414
00:15:56,631 --> 00:15:57,464
I agree with you on a preset.
I so much of what this administration 

415
00:15:59,511 --> 00:16:00,950
does is a self inflicted wound.

416
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:01,791
Right.
And,

417
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,170
and part of it is,
is,

418
00:16:03,171 --> 00:16:05,270
is,
is that they're just crap at messaging.

419
00:16:05,271 --> 00:16:06,860
Part of it is this idea that,
you know,

420
00:16:06,861 --> 00:16:08,810
he just says what's on his mind and he 
does,

421
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:10,580
right.
It's almost like he's got tourettes,

422
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:11,623
but I think he views it as a strength.
He views it as a reason why he got 

423
00:16:13,851 --> 00:16:16,040
elected.
And a lot of people out there think,

424
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:17,200
yeah,
that's his,

425
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,230
his base.
You know,

426
00:16:18,231 --> 00:16:19,970
the people that are really behind them 
no matter what.

427
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,550
I think they view it as part of his 
charm as well.

428
00:16:22,551 --> 00:16:27,170
And the problem is he does release 
classified information sometimes.

429
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:30,140
Yeah.
We've had that problem with,

430
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:32,510
uh,
several administrations.

431
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:35,330
They just don't know what to not say.
Well,

432
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:37,640
I think part of it again is,
uh,

433
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:39,140
yeah,
there's,

434
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:39,973
there's a,
a laxness that's developed over the 

435
00:16:41,331 --> 00:16:42,380
years and I don't know why.

436
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,393
Right?
Because,

437
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:44,221
you know,
I mean,

438
00:16:44,221 --> 00:16:46,460
I think about all the various security 
issues we face.

439
00:16:46,461 --> 00:16:48,650
And look,
we've been at war for 17 years,

440
00:16:48,651 --> 00:16:49,484
right?
Since nine 11 and all these things that 

441
00:16:51,561 --> 00:16:52,394
have been happening to us,
you would think that we'd be pretty 

442
00:16:53,451 --> 00:16:55,670
buttoned up.
But now every administration has had its

443
00:16:55,671 --> 00:16:56,504
moment where it's let slip.
And whether it was the press secretary 

444
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,410
of whether it was somebody rushing to 
the podium,

445
00:17:00,411 --> 00:17:01,820
it was somebody on Capitol Hill.
I mean,

446
00:17:01,821 --> 00:17:03,410
they're famous for it up there,
you know,

447
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:07,220
congressmen and congresswomen or 
senators all in the,

448
00:17:07,221 --> 00:17:07,630
in,
in,

449
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:11,120
in a rush to get in front of the camera 
to talk about something and then,

450
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:12,140
you know,
shit happens.

451
00:17:12,141 --> 00:17:13,190
Thanks.
Get out that they shouldn't.

452
00:17:13,191 --> 00:17:14,024
So I think it's,
it all kind of contributes to this 

453
00:17:16,101 --> 00:17:18,800
mentality that we started off talking 
about with,

454
00:17:18,801 --> 00:17:20,920
with the seals were,
you know,

455
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:22,213
why are we in this point where people 
are writing books and maybe getting 

456
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:26,300
outside the box?

457
00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:27,590
And I think it's just because,
yeah,

458
00:17:27,591 --> 00:17:30,320
it's this constant drip and lowering of 
standards like you mentioned,

459
00:17:30,321 --> 00:17:31,700
I think,
and it's a,

460
00:17:31,701 --> 00:17:33,550
I don't think we walk that dog bag.
I don't,

461
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,600
you know,
it just the way it is now,

462
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:36,443
you're not in the agency anymore,
but I'm sure you stay tight with people 

463
00:17:39,231 --> 00:17:40,420
that are still there.
What,

464
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:44,240
what is the attitude now with this 
administration?

465
00:17:44,241 --> 00:17:49,241
Like what they're doing with like the 
way he attacks the FBI and way,

466
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:50,310
like,
it just seems,

467
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:53,760
it seems so reckless.
Yeah,

468
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,590
it's,
it's a,

469
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:58,250
it's a unusual,
I mean that,

470
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:58,980
look,
I,

471
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:00,420
there's,
here's the way I feel,

472
00:18:00,421 --> 00:18:02,730
but I didn't vote for,
for president.

473
00:18:02,731 --> 00:18:03,564
I didn't vote for Hillary Clinton.
I think either of them than the best we 

474
00:18:08,221 --> 00:18:10,170
could do when a country of over 300 
million people,

475
00:18:10,171 --> 00:18:11,004
and we've talked about this before,
that it was you or I that did what 

476
00:18:13,021 --> 00:18:13,590
Hillary did.

477
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:14,550
We'd be in jail.
Yeah,

478
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,421
exactly.
Yeah.

479
00:18:15,421 --> 00:18:16,770
And so,
um,

480
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,540
but as far as you know,
what the,

481
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:20,640
the,
the current mood inside the agency as,

482
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:22,770
I mean,
if you talk to some former folks,

483
00:18:22,771 --> 00:18:23,604
they,
you know,

484
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:24,200
they,
they'll say,

485
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,530
ah,
morale is awful.

486
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:26,910
It was terrible.
And then,

487
00:18:26,911 --> 00:18:27,744
you know,
they just,

488
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:29,270
you know,
hating life because there's not,

489
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:31,590
I don't find that,
I find that,

490
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:33,180
um,
the,

491
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:34,643
frankly they're just more focused on 
operational concerns and priorities and 

492
00:18:37,921 --> 00:18:41,730
tasking than anything else.
Everybody's got a personal opinion.

493
00:18:41,731 --> 00:18:42,564
Right.
But I do think that the agency has 

494
00:18:43,771 --> 00:18:44,604
proven itself over the years at being 
better at pushing that down and 

495
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:50,304
understanding.
And in part because it's a smaller 

496
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:52,163
organization,
right then most of them then almost all 

497
00:18:55,321 --> 00:18:56,580
of them and,
but he's,

498
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:58,590
he's not,
he doesn't go after the CIA.

499
00:18:58,591 --> 00:19:00,120
Right.
It's only going after the FBI.

500
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,020
He's got the FBI.

501
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:01,411
I mean,
he's,

502
00:19:01,411 --> 00:19:02,131
you know,
he's questioned,

503
00:19:02,131 --> 00:19:02,964
he's done.
He's done some things in terms of 

504
00:19:03,361 --> 00:19:05,940
questioning CIA analysis and,
uh,

505
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:06,751
and,
and,

506
00:19:06,751 --> 00:19:07,410
uh,
you know,

507
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:10,650
some of the advice and guidance that 
they provided.

508
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:12,990
But that again,
you sort of look at and go,

509
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:13,651
hey,
look,

510
00:19:13,651 --> 00:19:16,200
we're feeding this into the NSC,
the National Security Council.

511
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,513
You guys,
you know,

512
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:18,240
that's,
that's,

513
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,950
that's an editorial process.
At that point,

514
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,750
you guys are going to have to make your 
decisions.

515
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:22,700
Um,
uh,

516
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:23,560
you know,
have,

517
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,393
people are going to say,
I'm just saying this because I'm 

518
00:19:25,141 --> 00:19:26,220
subjective and I,
you know,

519
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,770
I'm providing top cover for the agency,
but for the most part,

520
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:29,963
they just focus on getting shit done.
And we also have the benefit of big 

521
00:19:32,581 --> 00:19:35,790
focused overseas.
So we're not like the bureau is,

522
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:37,410
you know,
and it's a domestic organization,

523
00:19:37,411 --> 00:19:38,244
right?
So they,

524
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,630
you know,
they're drawn in,

525
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:42,240
the agency's got the advantage of,
look,

526
00:19:42,241 --> 00:19:44,730
we're having to deal with crap over 
there and not here.

527
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:46,013
So now,
what did you think when he said that 

528
00:19:48,371 --> 00:19:51,870
we're going to pull out of Syria?
Well,

529
00:19:51,871 --> 00:19:53,040
first of all,
yeah,

530
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:54,810
yeah,
they just had that,

531
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:55,471
uh,
we've,

532
00:19:55,471 --> 00:19:58,980
we've lost some servicemen up in 
northern Syria today.

533
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:01,650
Um,
today as a result of a bombing up there.

534
00:20:01,651 --> 00:20:03,240
Yeah,
Isis has taken credit for it.

535
00:20:03,241 --> 00:20:05,040
So there,
there was a,

536
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,600
uh,
patrol and we,

537
00:20:06,601 --> 00:20:09,840
and we've got roughly 2000 personnel in 
Syria.

538
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:11,363
And for the most part,
what are they doing there where they're 

539
00:20:12,481 --> 00:20:15,320
providing a guidance training.
Um,

540
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,530
they're assisting with targeting,
uh,

541
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:19,870
uh,
and because the,

542
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:22,830
the air power is incredibly important 
over there right now.

543
00:20:22,831 --> 00:20:24,990
And so we are,
uh,

544
00:20:24,991 --> 00:20:27,420
our personnel are,
uh,

545
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:31,080
very much involved in selection of 
identification of targets,

546
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,940
uh,
for the air campaign.

547
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:35,280
And,
um,

548
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:36,383
so we have these 2000 troops here.
President says he's going to withdraw 

549
00:20:38,821 --> 00:20:39,654
and then then some of the members of 
administration started walking that dog 

550
00:20:41,911 --> 00:20:42,360
back,
right.

551
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:43,200
And saying,
man,

552
00:20:43,201 --> 00:20:45,810
I know it may not happen right away,
but yeah,

553
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:46,980
they just,
there was just a,

554
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:48,810
a routine patrol.
Uh,

555
00:20:48,811 --> 00:20:51,040
if there this never really such thing as
a routine patrol,

556
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:52,870
but there's a patrol,
um,

557
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:54,880
and it got hit.
Uh,

558
00:20:54,881 --> 00:20:55,714
the military is not releasing a lot of 
details because they haven't finished 

559
00:20:58,001 --> 00:21:00,010
notifying next to kin,
but,

560
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:00,953
um,
numbers so far indicate possibly for 

561
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:05,050
service,
um,

562
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:06,550
uh,
lost.

563
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,970
Um,
and that's going to refocus,

564
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,930
I think Congress and hopefully the White
House on what the hell is going on.

565
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:19,870
The problem I've got with it is in terms
of withdrawing,

566
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:21,493
look,
we could stay there forever and not 

567
00:21:22,361 --> 00:21:24,430
accomplish the task,
right?

568
00:21:24,431 --> 00:21:28,990
If the task is to finally defeat 
whatever that means,

569
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:31,390
uh,
radical Islamic jihadists,

570
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:32,523
uh,
Isis,

571
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:36,850
uh,
that shit's never going to happen.

572
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,193
Not In our lifetimes.
We're not going to get rid of that 

573
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:41,860
mentality that,
that ideology,

574
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:44,260
uh,
the sort of what seems to be sometimes a

575
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:45,094
bottomless well of recruits that they 
can draw on their ability to morph into 

576
00:21:48,491 --> 00:21:51,560
something else as al Qaeda did,
um,

577
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:52,443
over,
depending on how successful we are in a 

578
00:21:54,221 --> 00:21:56,170
campaign against them,
they're like,

579
00:21:56,171 --> 00:21:56,651
you know,
again,

580
00:21:56,651 --> 00:21:57,041
it's,
it's,

581
00:21:57,041 --> 00:21:57,611
it's,
you know,

582
00:21:57,611 --> 00:21:58,151
it's like,
you know,

583
00:21:58,151 --> 00:22:00,280
step on roaches over here and they pop 
up over here.

584
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:04,920
So I think it's the,
the,

585
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:06,580
the,
the biggest problem I've got is,

586
00:22:06,581 --> 00:22:09,550
is that if we leave,
we're not,

587
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:11,050
we're not.
Um,

588
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:12,533
you know,
it's not like we're engaged in 

589
00:22:13,061 --> 00:22:15,130
firefights everyday with isis over 
there.

590
00:22:15,131 --> 00:22:15,964
Right.
We've left that to our allies and our 

591
00:22:17,891 --> 00:22:21,700
allies in most part up there in the 
north of Syria are the Kurds.

592
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:26,140
The Kurds have been our allies in one 
way or another in that part of the world

593
00:22:26,141 --> 00:22:26,974
for a long time now.
And it played a very important role and 

594
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:32,770
we have not been particularly honorable 
over the,

595
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:35,140
over the years in terms of how sometimes
we deal with them.

596
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:37,600
If we walk out,
if we leave,

597
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:41,030
then uh,
Irwin,

598
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,550
you know,
the head of Turkey,

599
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:44,253
I guarantee you we'll be in there in 
short order to kill as many of them as 

600
00:22:47,591 --> 00:22:52,270
possible because that's just what the 
Turkish authorities are going to do.

601
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:54,790
They honestly,
uh,

602
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:56,343
that they couldn't be happier with the 
announcement that we're going to leave 

603
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:00,730
because that opens the door for them to 
think,

604
00:23:00,731 --> 00:23:05,380
go in there and from their perspective,
stamp out the Kurdish alliance that have

605
00:23:05,381 --> 00:23:06,214
been our allies.
We're the only thing our presence at 

606
00:23:08,501 --> 00:23:09,790
small presence,
you know,

607
00:23:09,791 --> 00:23:10,770
not minimizing it,
but it,

608
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:11,613
you know,
2000 troops has been what's prevented 

609
00:23:13,391 --> 00:23:16,090
them from doing that.
So that's,

610
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,130
that's the number one issue I've got.
The other is,

611
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:19,893
I have no idea why any president or vice
president or anybody in the government 

612
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:25,323
ever,
not this is administration or any 

613
00:23:26,231 --> 00:23:27,064
administration ever thinks it's a,
it's a good idea to say we've defeated 

614
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:32,360
the enemy.
Uh,

615
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,273
when we're talking about radical Islam,
we've seen it over and over again from 

616
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:37,780
previous administration,
from the Bush administration.

617
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:38,950
Every time they say,
you know,

618
00:23:38,951 --> 00:23:39,880
we were,
we've done it,

619
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:42,100
mission accomplished,
mission accomplished though we'd be,

620
00:23:42,101 --> 00:23:43,900
we'd beaten al Qaeda,
we beat nicest.

621
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,550
That's it.
There's no upside to saying that.

622
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:48,710
Shut the fuck up.
Stop saying things like that.

623
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:50,870
It's again,
it's a self inflicted wound at the,

624
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,393
because now what's happening in the 
media is not focused on the fact that 

625
00:23:54,711 --> 00:23:56,840
we've lost servicemen.
They're focused on,

626
00:23:56,841 --> 00:23:57,441
well,
just,

627
00:23:57,441 --> 00:23:58,940
uh,
just the other day the president said,

628
00:23:58,941 --> 00:24:01,790
we defeated Isis and the vice president 
today said the same thing.

629
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:06,350
Now look what's happened.
There's no benefit to saying that.

630
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:06,701
And,
and,

631
00:24:06,701 --> 00:24:07,970
and it's not going to happen anyway.

632
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:12,830
So the goal of being over there is to 
assist our allies,

633
00:24:12,831 --> 00:24:17,831
but also to make sure that these radical
factions don't become more powerful.

634
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:21,560
And then eventually affect us and attack
us.

635
00:24:21,561 --> 00:24:23,750
And so we can keep an eye on what 
they're planning,

636
00:24:23,751 --> 00:24:25,250
what they're doing.
Is that,

637
00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:26,300
is that an accurate

638
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:26,811
yeah,
it is.

639
00:24:26,811 --> 00:24:26,981
It,
it,

640
00:24:26,981 --> 00:24:27,501
it's,
it's,

641
00:24:27,501 --> 00:24:28,430
it's exactly it.
I mean,

642
00:24:28,431 --> 00:24:32,750
if you look at
the reason we went into Afghanistan,

643
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,640
right?
If we go back all those years,

644
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:36,920
Holy Shit.
Uh,

645
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:42,830
and that was because the Taliban 
allowed,

646
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:43,783
um,
al Qaeda to establish a beachhead in 

647
00:24:46,791 --> 00:24:47,624
there for training and for 
communications and for finance and for 

648
00:24:51,831 --> 00:24:56,210
plotting and planning attacks outside of
Afghanistan against us and our allies.

649
00:24:57,020 --> 00:25:00,980
That's why we went in there,
aside from just seeking revenge,

650
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:05,060
obviously was to route that out.
We then stayed,

651
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:06,823
you know,
thinking somehow we were going to turn 

652
00:25:07,551 --> 00:25:10,240
the tide of history and create some 
pseudo federal democracy.

653
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,330
Right?
So that didn't,

654
00:25:11,331 --> 00:25:16,331
that didn't work.
But the reason now for being in Syria is

655
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:17,710
yes,
we,

656
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:22,580
we have done a very solid job of beating
back isis,

657
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:26,840
removing their territory and degrading 
their ability to operate.

658
00:25:27,170 --> 00:25:28,490
But we haven't stamped them out.

659
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:30,740
We haven't defeated them yet.
They're still there.

660
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:32,990
And so we've been providing the support 
and the,

661
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:34,690
again in the form of,
uh,

662
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:35,810
weapons,
hardware,

663
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,220
gear of resources,
training,

664
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:40,620
and most importantly a comp,
uh,

665
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:43,040
combat air operations,
air assaults.

666
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:44,380
And,
um,

667
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:50,060
that's been critically important.
If we leave,

668
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:54,350
I have no doubt that isis will find some
way to rejuvenate,

669
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:55,940
maybe not in its current form,
but,

670
00:25:55,941 --> 00:25:57,680
and maybe not in the same exact 
locations,

671
00:25:57,681 --> 00:25:59,330
but they don't work.
Cause that's what they do.

672
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,070
They just,
they just find a way to adapt.

673
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:04,310
And we already know what's happened in 
the past when we,

674
00:26:04,311 --> 00:26:05,144
when we left Iraq,
we saw what happened with the rise of 

675
00:26:06,491 --> 00:26:07,670
Isis.
So,

676
00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:11,540
you know,
I do I want to stay there forever.

677
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:12,403
Absolutely not.
But both sides can make a valid 

678
00:26:14,541 --> 00:26:16,370
argument.
One for staying,

679
00:26:16,371 --> 00:26:20,950
one for leaving my,
I think the best argument for staying in

680
00:26:20,951 --> 00:26:22,400
the,
in it certainly is short and midterm,

681
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:25,550
is to ensure that ertl on doesn't 
slaughter a bunch of Kurtz who have been

682
00:26:25,551 --> 00:26:26,900
working with us.
Uh,

683
00:26:26,901 --> 00:26:28,670
honorably.
Um,

684
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:31,670
you know,
I don't know how else to say that.

685
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:33,610
So we'll see what happens.
I,

686
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:33,960
the

687
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:34,793
best argument to stay is to protect the 
people that helped us to protect our 

688
00:26:38,551 --> 00:26:39,340
allies.
Yeah.

689
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:40,173
Yeah.
So it's not in our best interest is in 

690
00:26:41,281 --> 00:26:44,250
the best interest of our commitment and 
agreement with them.

691
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:49,170
Well,
is it in our national security interests

692
00:26:49,171 --> 00:26:50,660
do to stay in Syria,
for example?

693
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,100
Right.
There was this,

694
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:53,323
that has so many levels to this thing,
and I'm sure right now everybody's 

695
00:26:54,981 --> 00:26:56,150
listening going off.
Fuck Sake.

696
00:26:56,151 --> 00:26:57,560
He's not going to disappear down a 
rabbit hole.

697
00:26:57,561 --> 00:26:58,880
But,
but uh,

698
00:26:58,881 --> 00:26:59,714
yes,
I am.

699
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:01,140
Uh,
eh.

700
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:02,180
For a while there,
there was this,

701
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,340
this,
this idea,

702
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,193
this was ridiculous pie in the sky 
thought that we were going to get the 

703
00:27:06,111 --> 00:27:09,980
Russians out of Syria,
that we're going to fucking happen.

704
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:13,670
Russian said the only port for their 
Black Sea fleet as in Syria,

705
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:15,093
you know,
w w they've been there for decades and 

706
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:18,500
decades along with Iran.
We're net,

707
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:19,753
it's not gonna happen unless we want to 
go to war with Russia to kick them out 

708
00:27:21,711 --> 00:27:23,420
of Syria.
That's not in our best interest.

709
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:24,613
So is it in our national security 
interest to keep troops there to fight 

710
00:27:27,381 --> 00:27:29,900
and try to minimize Russian involvement 
in Syria?

711
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:30,733
I don't think so because we're not going
to shift them off that dime without 

712
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,900
going directly at them.
Right.

713
00:27:35,901 --> 00:27:36,734
It's in their best interest to stay and 
every nation accidents own best 

714
00:27:39,831 --> 00:27:41,660
interest.
Are we going to shift Iran?

715
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:44,300
Are we going to keep Iran from forming 
too late for that?

716
00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:47,360
They've already got a beachhead there 
that they're not going to give up.

717
00:27:47,810 --> 00:27:51,110
And so you've got to set those issues 
aside and say,

718
00:27:51,111 --> 00:27:52,490
well,
what the hell are we doing there?

719
00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:55,760
Oh we,
oh we there simply because we have to,

720
00:27:56,090 --> 00:27:57,950
you know,
finish the fight against Isis.

721
00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:00,320
Well,
you know,

722
00:28:00,321 --> 00:28:02,810
at some point you gotta say,
you know,

723
00:28:02,811 --> 00:28:04,360
I guess I wouldn't say that we've,
we're,

724
00:28:04,361 --> 00:28:06,380
we've defeated them,
but I think we would say,

725
00:28:06,381 --> 00:28:08,150
yeah,
we've degraded them sufficiently that we

726
00:28:08,151 --> 00:28:08,984
can,
we can now operate from elsewhere and 

727
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:12,263
then we can operate from forward basis 
and in other locations where we're 

728
00:28:14,571 --> 00:28:16,490
currently based.
Great.

729
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,193
But again,
I keep coming back to the same thing 

730
00:28:19,161 --> 00:28:19,671
that,
you know,

731
00:28:19,671 --> 00:28:21,740
we've,
we've worked with the Kurds.

732
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,480
Is this in our national security 
interest?

733
00:28:23,481 --> 00:28:24,314
Well,
no,

734
00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:27,320
I guess it's not,
but there's something that tells me it's

735
00:28:27,321 --> 00:28:30,560
the right thing to do and maybe 
sometimes that's enough,

736
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:31,701
you know,
that we should,

737
00:28:31,701 --> 00:28:34,130
we should not let [inaudible] have his 
way

738
00:28:34,210 --> 00:28:35,043
and also longterm wouldn't it be in our 
best interest to honor our commitment 

739
00:28:39,461 --> 00:28:44,461
and make sure that we protect our allies
so that in the future other allies would

740
00:28:44,681 --> 00:28:45,514
be more willing to cooperate with us 
because they understand that once we're 

741
00:28:49,301 --> 00:28:52,060
committed,
we're fully committed and we stay and we

742
00:28:52,061 --> 00:28:53,260
stand for something.
Yeah.

743
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:56,660
So what's the benefit of getting out?
Like the people that see,

744
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:57,543
think we should get out?
Like when trump said he wanted to pull 

745
00:28:59,381 --> 00:29:00,700
out,
like what's his thinking

746
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,730
runs particularly deep?
I think it just,

747
00:29:03,731 --> 00:29:04,840
I think it's,
you know,

748
00:29:04,841 --> 00:29:06,700
uh,
during the campaign he talked about,

749
00:29:06,701 --> 00:29:08,500
you know,
stopping the endless wars.

750
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:10,990
That's very popular concept right now.
Again,

751
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:11,880
nobody wants to,
I mean,

752
00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:12,570
what the hell?
I mean,

753
00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:14,980
and so it will be interesting to see,
you know,

754
00:29:14,981 --> 00:29:18,760
what today's sad event does up on 
Capitol Hill,

755
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:19,900
you know,
do they,

756
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:21,430
do they rethink their,
the,

757
00:29:21,431 --> 00:29:23,200
the withdrawal or do they accelerate it?

758
00:29:23,650 --> 00:29:24,483
Well,
like when they had the buildup in Iraq 

759
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,930
and it was highly criticized but then it
was very effective,

760
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:33,260
like it did do what they intended it to 
do.

761
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:37,250
Right.
And it did knock back the enemy.

762
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:38,443
If they decided to ramp it up worldwide,
would that be a solution to any of this 

763
00:29:44,411 --> 00:29:45,244
or is the opposite,
is it better to actually ramp up our 

764
00:29:47,801 --> 00:29:52,300
defenses domestically and just stay the 
fuck away from all of these people?

765
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:53,323
Yeah.
Um,

766
00:29:54,050 --> 00:29:54,883
well eventually you can only,
I mean you can only do so much I think 

767
00:29:57,291 --> 00:29:59,370
on the domestic front.
Um,

768
00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:00,940
and then,
uh,

769
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,113
you know,
if,

770
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:05,450
if they gained sufficient ability and 
strength,

771
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:07,700
we've seen that from past attacks,
I think then,

772
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:10,190
then they'll come after you,
they'll come after us.

773
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:13,910
And that's just the way I suppose that's
going to work.

774
00:30:13,911 --> 00:30:18,290
But I don't disagree with the notion 
because it is hard pressed.

775
00:30:18,291 --> 00:30:20,000
I look,
I wouldn't have stayed in Afghanistan.

776
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:21,043
Frankly,
I don't care whether they've increased 

777
00:30:22,401 --> 00:30:25,220
their literacy rate by 2% are built 
another road or whatever.

778
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:26,330
It doesn't matter.
They don't,

779
00:30:26,331 --> 00:30:27,710
they don't know what the hell we're 
trying to sell them.

780
00:30:27,711 --> 00:30:29,410
Right.
So I don't,

781
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,273
uh,
I'm not against the notion of getting 

782
00:30:31,761 --> 00:30:34,460
out,
but this one's a tough one.

783
00:30:34,461 --> 00:30:36,830
I guess that's what I'm saying is,
is that the Syria issue is,

784
00:30:36,831 --> 00:30:37,664
I'm real conflicted on because of the 
Kurds and what they've done on our 

785
00:30:40,641 --> 00:30:43,550
behalf in the past and how they've 
suffered and knowing,

786
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:46,040
uh,
going years and years back,

787
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:48,050
you know,
having dealt with that issue,

788
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,900
uh,
two and a half decades ago,

789
00:30:51,170 --> 00:30:53,540
a long time ago with the Turks and the 
Kurds,

790
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:54,643
knowing how vicious that could be a,
and I don't trust her to want as far as 

791
00:30:58,161 --> 00:30:59,210
I could throw him on a window.

792
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,970
So,
you know,

793
00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:03,110
I think there's a problem there that we 
need to,

794
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:06,410
we need to make sure we've talked 
through thoroughly before we just say,

795
00:31:06,411 --> 00:31:07,760
sure,
let's get them out of there.

796
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:08,990
You know,
what the hell,

797
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:10,110
you know,
we shouldn't have them there.

798
00:31:10,111 --> 00:31:13,220
And we shouldn't be there,
but like everything else,

799
00:31:13,221 --> 00:31:13,681
so it's,
it's,

800
00:31:13,681 --> 00:31:14,514
it's complicated.
You would like to think that what 

801
00:31:15,531 --> 00:31:17,510
they're having conversations like this 
up on Capitol Hill,

802
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:18,570
you know,
between the,

803
00:31:18,570 --> 00:31:20,600
the parties,
uh,

804
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:22,640
Republicans or the Dems,
but I don't think they are,

805
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:26,930
that's what was concerning me.
What concerns me is,

806
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:28,533
especially a guy like trump,
if trump is the guy who was decided 

807
00:31:30,891 --> 00:31:32,570
we're going to pull out a Syria,
like,

808
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:33,533
wow,
how does he have enough time to 

809
00:31:35,241 --> 00:31:40,241
carefully consider that as well as all 
the other things that are on his plate.

810
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:47,330
And when someone runs for president,
save someone's campaigning and they say,

811
00:31:47,390 --> 00:31:48,223
you know what,
I support a non interventional as 

812
00:31:50,001 --> 00:31:52,520
foreign policy.
I'm going to get us out of these,

813
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:53,383
these wars.
I'm going to get there doing this based 

814
00:31:55,671 --> 00:32:00,671
on a limited amount of information.
Like it's not like the CIA or the FBI or

815
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:04,130
anybody briefs them as they're running 
for president.

816
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:05,990
They don't have clearance.
Right,

817
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:06,310
right,

818
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:08,860
right.
Until you become the party nominee,

819
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:09,713
right.

820
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:12,320
When you're the party nominee,
then do you get a discussion?

821
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:14,360
Get you get some access,
right.

822
00:32:14,361 --> 00:32:16,190
It's not your stone out the president.
Right.

823
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:20,990
But you are given some ability to get a 
more intensive briefings.

824
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:21,853
Yeah.
Yeah.

825
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:22,753
But it's not,
it's not to the degree that the 

826
00:32:23,751 --> 00:32:24,030
president,

827
00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:24,863
so someone like Hillary,
she was already secretary of State 

828
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:28,770
Charlie.
She already knew pretty much

829
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:29,833
these things.
Yeah.

830
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:30,760
Yeah.
She had,

831
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:31,180
yeah.
She,

832
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:34,640
she was very switched on,
very informed.

833
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:38,750
She would just an awful candidate.
Yeah.

834
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:40,430
Sorry.
Um,

835
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:41,031
I,
you know,

836
00:32:41,031 --> 00:32:45,020
so I think that um,
look,

837
00:32:45,021 --> 00:32:45,854
I,
there's certain things that this 

838
00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:50,450
administration is doing foreign policy 
wise that I think are good.

839
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:52,400
It makes sense.
Um,

840
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,810
there were other things that I think,
you know,

841
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:56,910
you just leave you scratching your head.
Um,

842
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,153
but that's like every administration.
I guess my point is we've gotten away 

843
00:33:00,951 --> 00:33:02,090
from that ability,
right.

844
00:33:02,091 --> 00:33:04,100
I have conversations,
I go out to dinner with folks that,

845
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:05,091
you know,
on the,

846
00:33:05,091 --> 00:33:05,924
on the,
on the hard left and when you talk to 

847
00:33:08,571 --> 00:33:11,750
them,
they fully believe,

848
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:15,290
fully believe that president trump is a 
Russian puppet,

849
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:19,430
a wedding asset of Putin who is just 
doing Putin's bidding.

850
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:20,563
And they honestly honestly believe that 
and nothing is going to shift them off 

851
00:33:23,631 --> 00:33:25,180
that position too.

852
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,260
When you have a,
you know,

853
00:33:27,261 --> 00:33:28,094
that sort of frame of reference,
you don't have the ability to look at 

854
00:33:30,621 --> 00:33:32,510
anything rationally and say,
yeah,

855
00:33:32,511 --> 00:33:35,570
okay,
I like this policy related to China.

856
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:36,433
It's about time we call them out and say
that you obviously have not been a fair 

857
00:33:39,081 --> 00:33:39,914
trading partner.
That's something that every 

858
00:33:41,151 --> 00:33:43,750
administration has agreed to but has 
never done anything about.

859
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:45,710
So you would think that everybody will 
be able to say,

860
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:46,850
hmm,
makes sense.

861
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:47,713
Yeah,
I like it.

862
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:51,020
Everybody should be able to say the 
immigration,

863
00:33:51,050 --> 00:33:52,050
you know,
system here in the,

864
00:33:52,051 --> 00:33:54,560
in the states is somewhat dysfunctional.
It needs fixing.

865
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:55,573
Everybody's talked about that and yet 
they can't do it because they've got 

866
00:33:58,041 --> 00:33:59,930
this,
this mindset that,

867
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:03,560
that that prevents them from having any 
sort of conversation,

868
00:34:03,561 --> 00:34:07,400
any sort of rational discussion that 
could lead to some compromise that could

869
00:34:07,401 --> 00:34:10,550
then advance the ball and make this 
government more functional.

870
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:11,623
So,

871
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:13,550
so where we're at right now is,
uh,

872
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:15,960
today is day,
what are the shutdown?

873
00:34:16,410 --> 00:34:17,243
26th I think that would just be so 
800,000 American workers that work for 

874
00:34:23,041 --> 00:34:23,874
the government are not getting paid.
So there are a month out many of these 

875
00:34:27,181 --> 00:34:32,181
people paycheck to paycheck.
They don't have medical necessities,

876
00:34:32,851 --> 00:34:33,684
they don't have food.
People are happening to our rationale 

877
00:34:35,821 --> 00:34:36,860
off their,
their,

878
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:39,120
their insulin.
If they're diabetic.

879
00:34:39,121 --> 00:34:41,130
I mean I'm hearing these horror horror 
stories,

880
00:34:41,131 --> 00:34:44,220
the lines at the airport or around the 
fucking block.

881
00:34:44,221 --> 00:34:45,510
It's,
it's chaos.

882
00:34:45,870 --> 00:34:48,090
And it seems like there's no end in 
sight.

883
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:50,610
And it seems like trump has just content
to,

884
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:52,260
to sell,
hold this position.

885
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:53,163
Well,
I think both sides are content to hold 

886
00:34:53,731 --> 00:34:56,310
their position.
That seems fucking crazy to me.

887
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:59,250
It is crazy.
It's absolutely crazy.

888
00:34:59,251 --> 00:35:00,084
If you think about it.
And it's not just 800,000 I don't know 

889
00:35:01,531 --> 00:35:03,240
the exact numbers,
but think about all the,

890
00:35:03,870 --> 00:35:04,703
the contractors,
I think when all the government 

891
00:35:05,671 --> 00:35:06,570
contractors,
right,

892
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,210
I stay in,
I don't think they're good

893
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:09,850
paid.
Yeah.

894
00:35:09,850 --> 00:35:12,240
Right.
And so this has,

895
00:35:12,241 --> 00:35:12,841
and,
and you know,

896
00:35:12,841 --> 00:35:14,520
the administration has admitted that,
look,

897
00:35:14,521 --> 00:35:17,130
we initially underestimated the impact 
of,

898
00:35:17,131 --> 00:35:20,910
of a longer term shutdown.
And so they understand that.

899
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,110
And the Democrats,
you know,

900
00:35:22,111 --> 00:35:24,900
talk about it every minute about how 
this is a terrible crisis.

901
00:35:24,901 --> 00:35:27,720
And so you would think that if both 
sides feel that way,

902
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:29,613
uh,
then get something done and looked at 

903
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:35,040
the Democrats that they've approved in 
the past,

904
00:35:35,041 --> 00:35:35,874
recent past,
many of these Democrats voted for 

905
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:39,690
fencing barriers,
whatever you want to call it.

906
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:40,543
Yeah.
But we're lost in semantics and because 

907
00:35:41,911 --> 00:35:43,640
the president's so hated by this,
you know,

908
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:44,080
this,
this,

909
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:46,500
this group that,
you know,

910
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:50,670
they've seized on this term wall.
If he had started his campaign by saying

911
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:54,330
we need to improve our border security 
and,

912
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:57,390
uh,
find fixes to an immigration system that

913
00:35:57,391 --> 00:36:01,770
is both fair and secure and efficient.
If he had gone with that,

914
00:36:01,771 --> 00:36:02,604
it's a word he bumper sticker.
But if he had gone with that and we'd 

915
00:36:04,381 --> 00:36:06,390
have a different conversation right now,
we would,

916
00:36:06,391 --> 00:36:08,550
but maybe would have a different 
president as well.

917
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:11,551
Yeah.
That's okay.

918
00:36:11,551 --> 00:36:12,384
That's a good point.

919
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:15,920
There's something about that build that 
wall that's like the dopes.

920
00:36:15,921 --> 00:36:17,400
We're like,
Whoa,

921
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:18,830
get it John.
It's a wall.

922
00:36:18,831 --> 00:36:20,510
Still simple.
Build a wall.

923
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:23,630
Oh yeah.
Look her castle build a wall.

924
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:25,580
It seems so,
uh,

925
00:36:25,610 --> 00:36:27,380
it's,
it's such a visual.

926
00:36:27,450 --> 00:36:28,171
No,
you're right.

927
00:36:28,171 --> 00:36:28,861
That's,
and that's,

928
00:36:28,861 --> 00:36:29,880
you know,
that's where I miss out.

929
00:36:29,950 --> 00:36:32,110
I,
I'm way off on the,

930
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:34,640
in terms of being clever about politics,
but I,

931
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,000
well,
how to rope in rubes.

932
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,440
Yeah,
I should,

933
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:43,210
I should get better at that.
But he's got that down boy.

934
00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:45,940
I didn't even know the people that voted
for him.

935
00:36:45,941 --> 00:36:47,980
The people that are like real mag 
supporters,

936
00:36:48,190 --> 00:36:50,410
I didn't even know they existed in the 
numbers.

937
00:36:50,411 --> 00:36:53,140
They exist.
It's like he uncovered a rock.

938
00:36:53,350 --> 00:36:57,490
Like you flipped a rock over and there 
was an ant colony of rubes in there.

939
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,640
And just the sheer numbers,
it's like,

940
00:37:00,641 --> 00:37:03,370
whoa,
there's the top patio.

941
00:37:03,371 --> 00:37:04,390
Right.
It's a mixed bag.

942
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:06,080
You've got a lot of people very,
you know,

943
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:07,150
cause it's,
I,

944
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:07,983
I don't buy the idea that it's all just 
a bunch of crackers or a bunch of 

945
00:37:11,781 --> 00:37:12,700
idiots.
There's a,

946
00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:13,580
it's a,
it's a,

947
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:15,470
it's a real range of people.
There's,

948
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:16,333
there's that group of people that were 
just tired of being told they're idiots 

949
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:21,370
and they came out in force.
Right.

950
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:22,970
You can't tell,
you can't talk down to people.

951
00:37:22,971 --> 00:37:23,804
This is for the Democrats.
You can't keep talking down to people 

952
00:37:25,041 --> 00:37:26,810
and expect at some point,
then I can punch in the nose.

953
00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:27,271
That's right.
Well,

954
00:37:27,271 --> 00:37:31,690
they're still doing that now.
And there's still a there,

955
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:34,260
there,
there was some congressmen recently that

956
00:37:34,261 --> 00:37:38,220
was talked about all the people that 
supported trump and he was talking about

957
00:37:38,221 --> 00:37:42,180
them all being losers and alcoholics and
illiterate.

958
00:37:42,181 --> 00:37:43,260
And I'm like,
man,

959
00:37:43,830 --> 00:37:46,170
you're talking about half the country,
right?

960
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:47,980
No lesson learned,
right?

961
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:48,761
No,
absolutely.

962
00:37:48,761 --> 00:37:51,190
No self awareness.
And uh,

963
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:52,330
and that's,
you know,

964
00:37:52,331 --> 00:37:53,890
that's the story of,
of,

965
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:56,770
you know,
every election I think going forward is,

966
00:37:57,250 --> 00:37:58,060
you know,
you've,

967
00:37:58,060 --> 00:37:58,893
you've got the urban centers and you've 
got everybody else and everybody else 

968
00:38:03,371 --> 00:38:05,800
feels as if they're getting kicked in 
the ass.

969
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:08,170
And so I,
but,

970
00:38:08,171 --> 00:38:09,910
but yeah,
at the same time,

971
00:38:09,911 --> 00:38:11,080
you think,
look,

972
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:15,040
we should be able to do better.
We should.

973
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:16,600
I,
again,

974
00:38:16,601 --> 00:38:20,410
certain policies that they've got great,
but every day,

975
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:23,800
another tweet that seems a little 
dysfunctional every day,

976
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:25,300
you know,
some misstep every day,

977
00:38:25,301 --> 00:38:27,460
some self inflicted wound,
um,

978
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:29,320
shouldn't happen.
Not in a country.

979
00:38:29,321 --> 00:38:30,160
This size,
not,

980
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:33,100
not where we've got this much talent and
skill and capability.

981
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,920
So I don't know what 20 is going to 
bring,

982
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,570
but it's,
we got to,

983
00:38:37,571 --> 00:38:39,250
we're in for a hell of a ride between,
um,

984
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,020
you know,
look at all the shit that's happening.

985
00:38:41,050 --> 00:38:41,883
Yeah.
This seems like it might be one of the 

986
00:38:43,271 --> 00:38:46,110
bigger moves on the chessboard though.
This government shutdown,

987
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:50,140
like how this gets resolved one way or 
another and who comes out,

988
00:38:50,141 --> 00:38:50,974
at least the,
the visual is the optics are that 

989
00:38:54,431 --> 00:38:55,900
they're the winner.
Yeah.

990
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:56,793
That's,
it seems very critical because if the 

991
00:38:58,061 --> 00:39:02,110
Democrats win and somehow or another he 
abandons his idea for a wall,

992
00:39:02,290 --> 00:39:03,123
abandons the billions of dollars that 
he's been asking for for this wall that 

993
00:39:06,191 --> 00:39:07,024
gives them momentum.
We kicked his ass with that wall and 

994
00:39:09,461 --> 00:39:12,010
we're going to kick his ass and 20,
20

995
00:39:12,270 --> 00:39:13,590
exactly what they're thinking.
That is,

996
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:14,783
that is exactly what they're discussing 
in the war room when Nancy Pelosi keeps 

997
00:39:17,191 --> 00:39:18,024
them all in lockstep and she's done a 
good job so far of keeping the dams in 

998
00:39:20,851 --> 00:39:22,270
line.
Um,

999
00:39:22,350 --> 00:39:25,620
and that's why they wanted her back in,
at least the old guard wanted it back in

1000
00:39:25,621 --> 00:39:26,850
because that's what she does.
Well,

1001
00:39:26,851 --> 00:39:29,760
aside from fundraising,
so I,

1002
00:39:29,790 --> 00:39:30,930
you know,
I have a feeling that,

1003
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:32,460
look,
he's asking for whatever,

1004
00:39:32,461 --> 00:39:34,650
five point $7 billion in the scheme of 
things.

1005
00:39:34,651 --> 00:39:35,484
That's a drop in the bucket and Schumer 
and Pelosi in a wide variety of other 

1006
00:39:37,621 --> 00:39:39,840
people,
including the previous president and all

1007
00:39:39,841 --> 00:39:42,270
voted in the past for additional funding
for border security,

1008
00:39:42,271 --> 00:39:44,930
including fencing and barriers.
But they aren't,

1009
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:48,240
they're not going to budge off of this.
So what the hell does that mean?

1010
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:51,420
Does that mean he's,
he's being pushed into a corner where he

1011
00:39:51,421 --> 00:39:52,254
has no option but to declare a national 
emergency and use funds elsewhere so 

1012
00:39:54,811 --> 00:39:55,644
that he can say,
I finally got it done and looked at 

1013
00:39:56,611 --> 00:39:57,480
demos,
didn't do anything.

1014
00:39:58,130 --> 00:39:59,520
Uh,
who knows?

1015
00:39:59,521 --> 00:40:00,630
But you're,
I think you're absolutely right.

1016
00:40:00,631 --> 00:40:04,110
Whoever's perceived as the winner out of
this,

1017
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,820
you know,
ridiculous situation.

1018
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:07,200
Uh,
yeah,

1019
00:40:07,201 --> 00:40:09,060
they're going to beat that drum all the 
way to 2020.

1020
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,233
One of the things they've been saying 
too about the wall is that they want to 

1021
00:40:12,821 --> 00:40:15,040
keep drugs from coming in,
uh,

1022
00:40:15,041 --> 00:40:18,550
illegal drugs.
But from this El Chapo trial,

1023
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:19,683
we're learning how the biggest drug 
dealer in Mexico got his drugs and they 

1024
00:40:22,541 --> 00:40:25,210
didn't use,
they didn't get it through the wall.

1025
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:27,430
They brought it in through mostly boats.

1026
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:29,160
Yeah.
It's usually not,

1027
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:30,390
um,
just meals,

1028
00:40:30,391 --> 00:40:32,160
you know,
individuals carton into cross some,

1029
00:40:32,161 --> 00:40:33,330
you know,
broken part of the,

1030
00:40:33,331 --> 00:40:34,900
of the border.
They brought it

1031
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:38,730
cars in hidden compartments.
They brought it in through boats.

1032
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:39,860
I mean,
they're,

1033
00:40:39,861 --> 00:40:40,501
they're,
you know,

1034
00:40:40,501 --> 00:40:41,334
they basically have some people spilling
the beans as to how the exact operation 

1035
00:40:44,041 --> 00:40:44,874
was,
was functional and it didn't seem to 

1036
00:40:46,591 --> 00:40:49,200
involve people carrying it over the 
border on backpack.

1037
00:40:50,010 --> 00:40:51,330
Now when it goes months,
uh,

1038
00:40:51,430 --> 00:40:54,520
El Chapo is a lieutenants,
is a,

1039
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:55,373
as a cooperating witness and he's now,
he's now claiming that the former 

1040
00:40:58,751 --> 00:41:03,751
president of Mexico and UNESCO was given
$100 million at the outset of his term,

1041
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,610
I think it was 2012 when he started as 
president.

1042
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,980
So when he was president lacked,
he'd already won.

1043
00:41:11,981 --> 00:41:14,500
But he had his wedding to take the seat.
According to this,

1044
00:41:14,770 --> 00:41:18,280
this Colombian trafficker who was 
working with Guzman with chapel,

1045
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:22,750
a pinion eto reached out to him,
possibly there was campaign manager.

1046
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:23,860
However,
the story goes,

1047
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:27,940
my friend and he,
and he asked for 250 million and chapel,

1048
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:31,370
you know,
came back with a negotiated position.

1049
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:34,130
It says 100 million,
which was then according to this,

1050
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,760
again,
the guy's a Colombian trafficker.

1051
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:36,690
It,
you know,

1052
00:41:36,690 --> 00:41:38,720
how legitimate is he,
you know,

1053
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:40,460
uh,
then,

1054
00:41:41,010 --> 00:41:41,843
you know,
the money was transferred to opinion at 

1055
00:41:43,310 --> 00:41:44,143
tdot.
Uh,

1056
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:46,370
and you know,
opinion at all.

1057
00:41:46,371 --> 00:41:48,170
Those people are saying,
that's ridiculous.

1058
00:41:48,171 --> 00:41:50,240
Look,
we were the ones who tracked him down,

1059
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:51,410
you know,
even though we escaped,

1060
00:41:51,411 --> 00:41:53,450
you know,
48 times or whatever,

1061
00:41:53,451 --> 00:41:54,560
he escaped.
And,

1062
00:41:55,050 --> 00:41:56,360
uh,
but there's always been this,

1063
00:41:56,600 --> 00:42:01,600
this talk about how chopos arrests were 
orchestrated,

1064
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:02,780
right?
But,

1065
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:03,613
and that,
so that the,

1066
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:04,550
the,
the military,

1067
00:42:04,551 --> 00:42:08,150
the police were involved somehow that 
there was a coordinated effort.

1068
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:09,380
And,
uh,

1069
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:11,060
there's always been that underlying 
rumor,

1070
00:42:11,330 --> 00:42:14,000
you know,
is it possible anything's possible.

1071
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:18,410
But if he did get $100 million,
you would think El Chapo would be free.

1072
00:42:18,470 --> 00:42:20,840
Jesus Christ if $100 million and get 
your free.

1073
00:42:20,870 --> 00:42:21,450
Right.

1074
00:42:21,450 --> 00:42:21,991
Right.
Yeah,

1075
00:42:21,991 --> 00:42:22,770
I know.
And you would,

1076
00:42:22,770 --> 00:42:23,670
yeah.
You would assume that,

1077
00:42:23,910 --> 00:42:25,380
you know,
what's the upside for Chapo to,

1078
00:42:25,530 --> 00:42:27,150
to not talk about it now.
Right.

1079
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:29,010
Um,
but uh,

1080
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,270
you know,
who knows?

1081
00:42:30,370 --> 00:42:31,203
It's,
it's a precedent to mean where's he 

1082
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:34,970
doesn't have tax returns.
They could look at,

1083
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:37,100
it seems like a lot of cash.

1084
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:38,473
Hey,
moved it.

1085
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:39,333
Just moved it off shore immediately.
Apparently it was according to this 

1086
00:42:41,741 --> 00:42:46,300
witness or to this cooperating witness,
the money was delivered.

1087
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:47,413
Uh,
this may be the part of the story that 

1088
00:42:49,121 --> 00:42:49,954
doesn't hold up.
It was delivered to his campaign plane 

1089
00:42:51,281 --> 00:42:54,760
or something in his campaign manager 
took control of it and then they whisked

1090
00:42:54,761 --> 00:42:55,350
it away.

1091
00:42:55,350 --> 00:42:57,590
What are they going to know?
Hole in the ground somewhere.

1092
00:42:57,820 --> 00:43:01,470
It takes out a little at a time.
Keep everybody on that hush hush.

1093
00:43:02,590 --> 00:43:05,310
I was looking at that.
What's that crazy lady's name?

1094
00:43:05,311 --> 00:43:08,550
Laura loomer,
the lady Nancy Pelosi's fence.

1095
00:43:09,050 --> 00:43:09,630
She,
uh,

1096
00:43:09,630 --> 00:43:11,130
camped out on her,
her yard.

1097
00:43:12,030 --> 00:43:14,570
You know what made me think like,
how fucks Nancy Pelosi,

1098
00:43:14,571 --> 00:43:17,910
you own that house.
Where's she getting all that cash?

1099
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:19,890
Yeah.
What's her net worth now?

1100
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:22,080
A couple of hundred million.
Really?

1101
00:43:22,410 --> 00:43:25,050
I forget if I mean to do what she in 
business.

1102
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:28,470
She came from a hardcore political 
family and Baltimore I think,

1103
00:43:28,830 --> 00:43:31,710
and there's so much dirty money she's 
been doing.

1104
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:34,290
She's
100 million.

1105
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:38,790
I was waiting on us.
She's worth 100 million estimated,

1106
00:43:38,791 --> 00:43:39,624
but that's like,
I don't know if it's a one of those 

1107
00:43:41,190 --> 00:43:44,610
online at work.
Where does she get her money from?

1108
00:43:45,350 --> 00:43:46,820
Oh,
you gotta be Shit.

1109
00:43:46,830 --> 00:43:47,790
You know what?
Maybe she's good at.

1110
00:43:47,791 --> 00:43:50,010
Just scrounge Jamie keeping her a per 
diem.

1111
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:51,390
Yeah,
that's

1112
00:43:53,210 --> 00:43:54,270
what I mean.
What is the,

1113
00:43:54,271 --> 00:43:58,050
what's her national set annual salary?
Well,

1114
00:43:58,051 --> 00:44:00,120
she just started getting it for this 
job.

1115
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:02,310
Wouldn't it be a 450 grams?

1116
00:44:02,710 --> 00:44:03,461
Wow.
No,

1117
00:44:03,461 --> 00:44:03,791
no,
that's,

1118
00:44:03,791 --> 00:44:04,624
that's the net worth of five.
Which net worth or a median net worth 

1119
00:44:06,530 --> 00:44:07,870
now?
This person's okay.

1120
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:08,793
Congress person.
So it can't be anything higher than an 

1121
00:44:11,891 --> 00:44:14,770
sis something.
So it's probably not more than a hundred

1122
00:44:15,250 --> 00:44:18,000
it's all her good work.
She did with the Clinton Foundation.

1123
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:21,000
Oh,
speaker of the house gets (220) 300-0200

1124
00:44:21,001 --> 00:44:22,740
grand.
She's worth $100 million.

1125
00:44:22,770 --> 00:44:26,550
What in the holy fuck is that?
How has that,

1126
00:44:26,610 --> 00:44:28,530
and she does have a big wall around it.
Please.

1127
00:44:28,730 --> 00:44:30,930
Yeah.
Not enough to keep.

1128
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:31,980
Laura loomer

1129
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:36,710
is not an athlete.
Steve's right over that son of a mess.

1130
00:44:36,870 --> 00:44:40,560
It's not like she's a park core athlete.
Fuck.

1131
00:44:40,561 --> 00:44:42,600
Did she get over that?
I show up with some,

1132
00:44:42,630 --> 00:44:43,560
uh,
illegals,

1133
00:44:43,830 --> 00:44:46,350
illegal immigrants or whatever,
undocumented workers,

1134
00:44:46,351 --> 00:44:49,200
whatever issues.
She changed herself to twitter.

1135
00:44:49,230 --> 00:44:51,150
I know she did that to that broad.
That's right.

1136
00:44:51,330 --> 00:44:53,420
She's going hard for attention.
It's,

1137
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:55,490
it's very interesting when these,
uh,

1138
00:44:55,530 --> 00:44:59,280
these people just try so hard to make it
into the news.

1139
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:01,080
Well,
they're looking for a contributor slot.

1140
00:45:01,110 --> 00:45:03,120
They're looking for on one network or 
another.

1141
00:45:03,150 --> 00:45:05,690
I think that's what they're doing.
You have to nowadays,

1142
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:06,930
I think that that,
I think,

1143
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:10,650
at least my theory is anyway,
if you want to be a paid contributor for

1144
00:45:10,651 --> 00:45:11,471
a network,
no,

1145
00:45:11,471 --> 00:45:14,640
it doesn't matter which network.
You'll got to stake out a position.

1146
00:45:14,870 --> 00:45:16,830
Uh,
that involves some crazy,

1147
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:17,753
right?
You've got to be like you how they get 

1148
00:45:18,661 --> 00:45:22,520
be all in for president trump or you 
gotta be all out if you,

1149
00:45:22,530 --> 00:45:24,330
if you live in the center,
that ain't happening.

1150
00:45:24,470 --> 00:45:26,070
Right?
Nobody wants to hear from anybody in the

1151
00:45:26,071 --> 00:45:29,730
middle because that Shit's not picking 
up the ratings at all.

1152
00:45:29,780 --> 00:45:32,730
So no one wants reasonable middle right 
now?

1153
00:45:32,770 --> 00:45:33,450
No.
No.

1154
00:45:33,450 --> 00:45:35,610
The only time that I think reasonable,
middle,

1155
00:45:35,611 --> 00:45:36,444
whatever workout as if the two ends are 
so fucked up and they're fighting so 

1156
00:45:40,771 --> 00:45:42,810
hard on the opposite ends.
Like someone's like,

1157
00:45:42,811 --> 00:45:43,644
God,
surely it's got to be a reasonable 

1158
00:45:44,401 --> 00:45:45,234
middle and then someone comes along.
It's almost like the people gotta be 

1159
00:45:47,641 --> 00:45:48,474
screaming for it,
but right now it doesn't seem like 

1160
00:45:49,411 --> 00:45:52,800
people are screaming for no sensible 
centrist position.

1161
00:45:52,830 --> 00:45:55,350
It's like a world war one trench 
warfare,

1162
00:45:55,470 --> 00:45:56,120
right.
I mean that's,

1163
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:58,470
that's the way it is with the government
shut down right now and I'll close.

1164
00:45:58,471 --> 00:45:59,304
He's sitting over here in the mud and 
president trump's sitting over here in 

1165
00:46:01,291 --> 00:46:04,320
the mud and nobody's given any ground 
and they're just,

1166
00:46:04,321 --> 00:46:06,630
they're just occasionally taking a shot 
at each other.

1167
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:09,720
Throwing a hand grenade and nobody is 
making any,

1168
00:46:09,750 --> 00:46:12,030
any movement.
So I,

1169
00:46:12,031 --> 00:46:12,541
you know,
again,

1170
00:46:12,541 --> 00:46:14,940
how do they shut the,
or how do they stop the shutdown?

1171
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:17,460
You can't,
if you're not talking,

1172
00:46:17,550 --> 00:46:18,510
if you're not,
if there's,

1173
00:46:18,511 --> 00:46:20,880
if there's no effort,
it's not going to happen.

1174
00:46:21,090 --> 00:46:23,190
So everybody's looking at this right now
and thinking,

1175
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:25,410
you know,
where's it go?

1176
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:28,620
It's affecting the markets.
It makes us look like morons.

1177
00:46:28,890 --> 00:46:29,970
Uh,
I mean,

1178
00:46:29,971 --> 00:46:31,080
not that others aren't.
I mean,

1179
00:46:31,081 --> 00:46:32,160
look at,
look at Britain,

1180
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:33,180
right?
With the brexit thing.

1181
00:46:33,181 --> 00:46:35,560
Look at France with the yellow vests.
Look at the,

1182
00:46:35,561 --> 00:46:37,110
you know,
Germany's having a tissue.

1183
00:46:37,111 --> 00:46:37,944
So,
Eh,

1184
00:46:38,010 --> 00:46:39,480
you know,
everybody's having some,

1185
00:46:39,481 --> 00:46:40,440
some,
some problems,

1186
00:46:40,441 --> 00:46:42,780
but you know,
we didn't need to add to the noise.

1187
00:46:43,350 --> 00:46:47,100
John Stossel had an interesting video 
that he put out where he's saying,

1188
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:47,993
what this does actually highlight is 
that there's a lot of things that the 

1189
00:46:50,371 --> 00:46:51,060
government does.

1190
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:54,000
It really should probably be privatized 
and we wouldn't have these issues.

1191
00:46:54,750 --> 00:46:55,710
Does that,
I mean,

1192
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:57,690
it kind of made sense to me,
but I don't know a lot.

1193
00:46:57,720 --> 00:46:58,141
Yeah,
no,

1194
00:46:58,141 --> 00:46:58,531
I,
I'm,

1195
00:46:58,531 --> 00:47:00,750
I'm a small government person.
At the end of the day,

1196
00:47:00,751 --> 00:47:01,261
I think,
you know,

1197
00:47:01,261 --> 00:47:04,680
there's certain things that we need to 
rely on the government for a,

1198
00:47:04,681 --> 00:47:06,840
and one of them would be of course,
national security,

1199
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:07,771
terrific.
You know,

1200
00:47:07,771 --> 00:47:09,360
collection of federal taxes.
Okay,

1201
00:47:09,361 --> 00:47:11,220
fine that day they're going to do that 
regardless.

1202
00:47:11,530 --> 00:47:14,220
Uh,
but otherwise just stand on my kitchen.

1203
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:14,730
Right,
right.

1204
00:47:14,730 --> 00:47:15,420
Don't,
don't,

1205
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:16,980
you know,
and so,

1206
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:17,873
and that's why I've always been 
surprised me mean the Republican's 

1207
00:47:19,171 --> 00:47:20,610
problem I got with them is,
you know,

1208
00:47:20,670 --> 00:47:21,503
you can't sit around and argue for small
government and then try to tell people 

1209
00:47:24,270 --> 00:47:27,630
what to do with their bodies or who can 
get married and who can't get married.

1210
00:47:27,631 --> 00:47:28,740
Who the fuck cares?

1211
00:47:28,870 --> 00:47:29,770
I right.
Just don't,

1212
00:47:29,771 --> 00:47:31,780
don't hurt people.
Be a good person.

1213
00:47:31,930 --> 00:47:32,763
Get on with it.
I don't need to celebrate your 

1214
00:47:34,211 --> 00:47:36,910
lifestyle,
but just do it.

1215
00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:37,773
I really don't care.
I don't expect you to care about my 

1216
00:47:39,881 --> 00:47:41,560
lifestyle.
I don't care about yours.

1217
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:45,120
But the Republicans have always stuck 
their nose in this and you can't,

1218
00:47:45,121 --> 00:47:48,070
you can't make that argument for,
for wanting small government.

1219
00:47:48,071 --> 00:47:51,310
And if you just want to step into 
people's bedrooms all the time,

1220
00:47:51,860 --> 00:47:52,693
it doesn't make any sense.
And I think the only reason why they do 

1221
00:47:54,881 --> 00:47:58,160
it is because it gets people excited 
that they get to run to,

1222
00:47:58,170 --> 00:47:59,260
to,
to vote for them.

1223
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:03,130
I think when they take these positions,
it's not like these are really having an

1224
00:48:03,131 --> 00:48:03,964
effect on their lives or at some moral 
stand that they must take because God 

1225
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:07,744
wants them to do it.
I think they do it because they think 

1226
00:48:09,551 --> 00:48:10,384
that it's going to get,
it's going to shift the pole one way or 

1227
00:48:12,581 --> 00:48:13,080
another.

1228
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:13,913
Yeah.
And it's going to get people excited 

1229
00:48:14,921 --> 00:48:15,754
about them possibly making some sort of 
a difference that they feel is going to 

1230
00:48:18,401 --> 00:48:21,640
significantly affect their position.
But do you ever get to the point,

1231
00:48:21,641 --> 00:48:22,474
I mean,
I don't know whether that's going to 

1232
00:48:23,411 --> 00:48:24,244
happen,
but you would think that you've got the 

1233
00:48:26,561 --> 00:48:28,600
people on the hard right and the hard 
left,

1234
00:48:28,660 --> 00:48:29,890
they're not going to shift.
Right.

1235
00:48:29,891 --> 00:48:31,780
That's not going to happen.
You're not going to move those people.

1236
00:48:31,781 --> 00:48:32,614
So like everybody always talks about 
decisions are made by that small group 

1237
00:48:35,681 --> 00:48:36,514
in the center.
So at what point did the group in the 

1238
00:48:38,801 --> 00:48:40,150
center find it?
Put their hands up and go,

1239
00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:41,650
you guys are all fucked up.
Right.

1240
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:43,360
How about a third party that's 
legitimate,

1241
00:48:43,390 --> 00:48:44,910
not a libertarian party because that's 
right.

1242
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:47,120
It hasn't been working out.
Um,

1243
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:48,513
but something that creates a little bit 
of a different dynamic and we're never 

1244
00:48:51,791 --> 00:48:52,660
going to get term limits.

1245
00:48:52,660 --> 00:48:53,750
So that's,
you know,

1246
00:48:53,980 --> 00:48:55,870
tilting at windmills,
but maybe,

1247
00:48:55,871 --> 00:48:58,030
you know,
maybe we get that multiparty thing go on

1248
00:48:58,420 --> 00:48:59,860
that.
Ha again.

1249
00:48:59,950 --> 00:49:01,690
Okay.
It's pie in the sky.

1250
00:49:01,910 --> 00:49:02,381
Well,
crap.

1251
00:49:02,381 --> 00:49:04,240
Closest we ever got to it was Ross 
Perot,

1252
00:49:04,241 --> 00:49:05,260
right?
Yeah,

1253
00:49:05,261 --> 00:49:06,094
pretty much.
Yeah.

1254
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:07,870
And he was,
so,

1255
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:11,500
it was a piece of work,
but when he took out a whole,

1256
00:49:11,860 --> 00:49:12,693
he took a block of time,
I believe it was a half an hour on 

1257
00:49:14,471 --> 00:49:19,300
national television.
He bought the time to explain how you're

1258
00:49:19,301 --> 00:49:20,320
getting fucked.
Yeah.

1259
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:24,490
And explained taxes and explain all 
these different things.

1260
00:49:24,491 --> 00:49:25,870
And people are like,
wait,

1261
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:27,190
what?
That's how it works.

1262
00:49:27,220 --> 00:49:29,820
It's good tv.
If you can go back and find it.

1263
00:49:29,821 --> 00:49:31,990
It's,
it's Ross Perot was good tv.

1264
00:49:32,050 --> 00:49:34,070
I'll show you what I'm doing here.
Well.

1265
00:49:34,130 --> 00:49:35,260
Yeah,
I see.

1266
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:38,070
That's all that's all fucked up.
And here's where again,

1267
00:49:38,130 --> 00:49:41,140
fuck yeah.
A shit.

1268
00:49:41,170 --> 00:49:41,981
Hey,
we talked about,

1269
00:49:41,981 --> 00:49:43,690
remember the last time we talked about 
Huawei?

1270
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:45,370
Yes.
And it hasn't gone away.

1271
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:46,990
No,
it hasn't gotten the way sees good.

1272
00:49:47,050 --> 00:49:49,330
Someone just got arrested yesterday.
Two people,

1273
00:49:49,780 --> 00:49:50,910
two people.
Uh,

1274
00:49:51,670 --> 00:49:52,900
so,
uh,

1275
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:55,300
so backstory,
fascinating.

1276
00:49:55,301 --> 00:49:56,170
This is fascinating.
So I,

1277
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:57,113
this is,
this is an area I could definitely 

1278
00:49:57,761 --> 00:50:00,150
disappear down to Chinese espionage,
right?

1279
00:50:01,090 --> 00:50:02,960
They go on forever.
Uh,

1280
00:50:03,290 --> 00:50:05,100
once again I say,
you know,

1281
00:50:05,110 --> 00:50:07,570
I talk about are there certain things 
that the current administration is doing

1282
00:50:07,571 --> 00:50:08,404
that I like?
One of them is the way that they're 

1283
00:50:09,251 --> 00:50:11,740
dealing with China right now.
And yes,

1284
00:50:11,741 --> 00:50:15,070
the trade issue is buffeting the market 
somewhat and causing some instability.

1285
00:50:15,071 --> 00:50:17,950
But again,
previous administration,

1286
00:50:17,951 --> 00:50:19,840
the Bush administration clinic,
lots of,

1287
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:20,733
lots of prep from former presidents.
They all acknowledged that China pub 

1288
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:26,800
privately was not a fair trading 
partner.

1289
00:50:27,050 --> 00:50:27,883
This administration's at least trying to
call them out and calling them out on 

1290
00:50:29,871 --> 00:50:30,321
the,
on the,

1291
00:50:30,321 --> 00:50:32,430
in the cyber issue too,
uh,

1292
00:50:32,690 --> 00:50:34,790
on their,
on their theft of intellectual property.

1293
00:50:35,210 --> 00:50:36,370
So anyway,
wowway,

1294
00:50:36,630 --> 00:50:37,463
um,
supposedly owned by the founder and 

1295
00:50:41,810 --> 00:50:43,480
however many employees,
you know,

1296
00:50:43,490 --> 00:50:46,490
I think Huawei is by the way,
uh,

1297
00:50:46,550 --> 00:50:49,940
the number one telecommunications 
equipment manufacturer in the world.

1298
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:52,790
And they're the number two seller of 
smartphones,

1299
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:53,600
right?
They,

1300
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:53,961
they're,
they're,

1301
00:50:53,961 --> 00:50:55,760
they're a bigger seller of smartphones 
and apple.

1302
00:50:56,060 --> 00:50:57,710
So at Samsung,
Huawei,

1303
00:50:57,740 --> 00:50:59,000
apple,
uh,

1304
00:50:59,001 --> 00:51:02,690
for this.
And so supposedly the company's owned by

1305
00:51:02,691 --> 00:51:05,420
the founder and his daughter is the 
chief operating officer,

1306
00:51:05,450 --> 00:51:07,040
chief financial officer,
one of those.

1307
00:51:07,460 --> 00:51:09,530
She was arrested up in Canada,
um,

1308
00:51:09,650 --> 00:51:10,483
and she was arrested at the request of 
the u s she's up there on bail right 

1309
00:51:12,621 --> 00:51:14,540
now,
waiting extradition hearing.

1310
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:16,033
And the reason was because supposedly 
she lied about wally's dealings with 

1311
00:51:20,511 --> 00:51:21,344
Iran and they were busting sanctions by 
dealing and providing certain types of 

1312
00:51:24,771 --> 00:51:27,860
equipment to Iran.
Now,

1313
00:51:27,950 --> 00:51:28,910
uh,
this,

1314
00:51:28,911 --> 00:51:29,744
this,
this past week we've had a hallway 

1315
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:36,500
employee who's now been fired by Huawei 
in Poland,

1316
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:38,660
uh,
arrested for espionage.

1317
00:51:39,350 --> 00:51:42,890
And along with him is a member of the 
Polish intelligence service,

1318
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:44,113
right.
Who,

1319
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:45,033
uh,
retired now and was now working for a 

1320
00:51:47,541 --> 00:51:48,374
French telecommunications company,
but was arrested also for a espionage 

1321
00:51:52,670 --> 00:51:57,170
related to a and unrelated to this 
individual who up until just recently it

1322
00:51:57,171 --> 00:52:00,230
was working for wallet,
Huawei Claims Innocence and says,

1323
00:52:00,231 --> 00:52:01,340
well,
we have no idea.

1324
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:04,250
And the founder just came out and gave 
this big speech and said,

1325
00:52:04,670 --> 00:52:07,550
I would never let the Chinese 
authorities tell me what to do.

1326
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:08,384
And now we'd certainly never spy on 
anybody using quallies capabilities and 

1327
00:52:11,121 --> 00:52:13,910
technology.
And people are probably thinking,

1328
00:52:13,911 --> 00:52:15,260
what the fuck are you talking about?
This for?

1329
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:20,920
A Huawei embeds their telecommunications
equipment throughout the world,

1330
00:52:21,470 --> 00:52:23,000
right?
So it's in,

1331
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:24,580
uh,
uh,

1332
00:52:24,590 --> 00:52:25,530
our allies,
uh,

1333
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:29,030
military operations,
which then are connected to ours,

1334
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:29,953
right.
In terms of communications and transfer 

1335
00:52:30,951 --> 00:52:33,320
of intelligence and information.
Um,

1336
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:34,610
they're everywhere.

1337
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:35,713
And they chose Poland.
They've been in Poland for about 10 

1338
00:52:37,731 --> 00:52:40,010
years.
Poland is a very important NATO ally.

1339
00:52:40,370 --> 00:52:41,203
So I,
I'm,

1340
00:52:41,210 --> 00:52:43,520
I'm taking a long time,
I realized to explain this,

1341
00:52:43,730 --> 00:52:47,210
but what I'm trying to say is nothing 
happens by happenstance,

1342
00:52:47,350 --> 00:52:49,070
right?
The Chinese don't operate that way.

1343
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:52,850
So the Chinese authorities sometime ago,
years ago,

1344
00:52:52,851 --> 00:52:54,380
looked at it and went,
yeah,

1345
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:55,940
this makes sense,
right?

1346
00:52:56,150 --> 00:52:57,380
We've got Huawei,
which by the way,

1347
00:52:57,381 --> 00:52:59,340
the founder is a former military,
uh,

1348
00:52:59,510 --> 00:53:02,330
people's Liberation Army engineer.
Um,

1349
00:53:02,690 --> 00:53:03,830
he,
um,

1350
00:53:04,530 --> 00:53:05,430
they,
they,

1351
00:53:05,431 --> 00:53:06,980
they looked at this and they thought 
Poland,

1352
00:53:07,310 --> 00:53:08,990
uh,
that would be a good beachhead for us,

1353
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:11,840
right?
Because there are a key element of NATO,

1354
00:53:12,260 --> 00:53:13,093
so let's go to Poland.
So they started a burrowing into Poland 

1355
00:53:15,501 --> 00:53:16,334
striking deals and you know,
they're basically the most important 

1356
00:53:18,110 --> 00:53:18,943
foreign relationship now a corporation 
inside a Poland and they're fully 

1357
00:53:24,561 --> 00:53:29,340
embedded and they've had access to at 
this point to NATO communications.

1358
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:31,650
And now the arrest of these two 
individuals.

1359
00:53:31,950 --> 00:53:35,790
And people will still,
despite this and despite their past,

1360
00:53:35,791 --> 00:53:36,930
despite their,
their,

1361
00:53:36,931 --> 00:53:39,890
their theft of information from 
everybody from us steel to,

1362
00:53:40,180 --> 00:53:41,340
uh,
to Alcoa,

1363
00:53:41,341 --> 00:53:45,600
to Lockheed Martin to dupont,
all the times that they've been stealing

1364
00:53:45,601 --> 00:53:47,950
information,
people will still go wide.

1365
00:53:48,180 --> 00:53:49,290
You know,
I don't,

1366
00:53:49,730 --> 00:53:50,760
I don't believe it.
I don't,

1367
00:53:50,761 --> 00:53:51,594
that doesn't make any sense.
I don't see why the Chinese would act 

1368
00:53:53,011 --> 00:53:54,450
that way.
And I don't see why we're being so harsh

1369
00:53:54,451 --> 00:53:55,290
on them.
You know,

1370
00:53:55,291 --> 00:53:57,840
this tariff thing is a bad idea.
My point being,

1371
00:53:58,020 --> 00:53:58,853
you got to call them out.
They're not going to necessarily change 

1372
00:54:00,571 --> 00:54:03,660
their behavior,
but you got to raise public awareness,

1373
00:54:03,661 --> 00:54:04,494
make uh,
our allies understanding where that's 

1374
00:54:05,671 --> 00:54:07,830
what we're doing right now.
We're saying you've gotta,

1375
00:54:07,860 --> 00:54:10,590
you've gotta put the brakes on this,
build a firewall,

1376
00:54:10,870 --> 00:54:13,500
use other companies,
telecommunications equipment.

1377
00:54:13,910 --> 00:54:14,743
Because you know,
the fact that we're tied in with our 

1378
00:54:16,621 --> 00:54:17,454
allies,
with Poland and with Canada and you 

1379
00:54:20,011 --> 00:54:21,690
know,
that gives them access to us.

1380
00:54:21,750 --> 00:54:24,780
So for someone on the outside,
look myself was trying to look at this.

1381
00:54:24,930 --> 00:54:25,763
And you,
you say that while stealing stuff like 

1382
00:54:27,751 --> 00:54:30,390
stealing stuff from us steel,
how are they doing that?

1383
00:54:30,780 --> 00:54:31,613
Well,
they,

1384
00:54:31,650 --> 00:54:34,190
I mean the u s steel,
admittedly that was,

1385
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:36,330
that was a pla,
that was the People's Liberation Army,

1386
00:54:36,390 --> 00:54:38,860
a third department operation against 
dupont and,

1387
00:54:39,210 --> 00:54:41,820
and also against us steel and others.
So that was a little bit different.

1388
00:54:41,821 --> 00:54:43,110
I,
I conflated the two.

1389
00:54:43,111 --> 00:54:43,944
But Huawei,
one of the things that they do is by 

1390
00:54:46,051 --> 00:54:47,400
having access,
uh,

1391
00:54:47,450 --> 00:54:48,283
and,
and embedding their equipment in your 

1392
00:54:50,341 --> 00:54:55,341
communications infrastructure,
that gives them the ability then to,

1393
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:56,611
uh,
in,

1394
00:54:56,611 --> 00:54:58,920
in a simple way to tap in,
right?

1395
00:54:58,950 --> 00:55:00,870
It's just a package intercept 
information,

1396
00:55:00,871 --> 00:55:01,110
right?

1397
00:55:01,110 --> 00:55:02,740
Basically.
So you have communication.

1398
00:55:02,741 --> 00:55:05,340
So imagine we're trading information 
through NATO,

1399
00:55:05,540 --> 00:55:06,750
uh,
channels,

1400
00:55:07,130 --> 00:55:09,420
right?
All they need is that one in,

1401
00:55:09,570 --> 00:55:10,151
right?
That's it.

1402
00:55:10,151 --> 00:55:11,700
It's like everything else.
It's like fishing,

1403
00:55:11,730 --> 00:55:12,350
right?
It's just like,

1404
00:55:12,350 --> 00:55:12,810
you know,
when,

1405
00:55:12,810 --> 00:55:15,300
when hackers just an individual hacker 
sitting in somebody's basement,

1406
00:55:15,301 --> 00:55:17,130
you know,
he just needs that one avenue.

1407
00:55:17,131 --> 00:55:18,980
He needs to get one s.
It's just,

1408
00:55:19,050 --> 00:55:21,720
just click on that email that gives me 
the pathway in.

1409
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:22,913
So when,
when Huawei is able to embed their 

1410
00:55:24,181 --> 00:55:25,014
technology into Polish communications,
and we're now connected because of our 

1411
00:55:31,531 --> 00:55:34,320
NATO alliance,
that gives them access to us,

1412
00:55:34,410 --> 00:55:35,820
France,
whomever.

1413
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:39,780
And you know,
it's not as if it just happened.

1414
00:55:39,781 --> 00:55:42,400
It's not as if Huawei from a business 
perspective says,

1415
00:55:42,420 --> 00:55:43,253
you know,
I bet we could sell some of our 

1416
00:55:43,861 --> 00:55:45,420
equipment and Poland.
Wouldn't that be good?

1417
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:46,433
The guy who was arrested,
the Huawei person who was arrested was 

1418
00:55:48,271 --> 00:55:50,380
responsible for,
uh,

1419
00:55:50,610 --> 00:55:55,140
the provision of telecommunication 
equipment to government facilities.

1420
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:58,110
That was his job.
And the guy,

1421
00:55:58,170 --> 00:55:59,003
the Polish guy,
one of his last jobs with the Intel 

1422
00:56:01,051 --> 00:56:02,880
service was,
uh,

1423
00:56:03,090 --> 00:56:03,960
communications.

1424
00:56:06,140 --> 00:56:06,973
So I guess what I'm saying is none of 
this shit happens in a bubble and it's 

1425
00:56:09,841 --> 00:56:11,250
all,
it's all very well mapped out.

1426
00:56:11,251 --> 00:56:12,084
The Chinese have a very long view on 
things and they are very good at 

1427
00:56:16,201 --> 00:56:19,980
developing operations like this and so 
they've been very successful.

1428
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:21,590
Um,
so we'll,

1429
00:56:21,591 --> 00:56:22,321
we'll,
we'll see.

1430
00:56:22,321 --> 00:56:22,960
But it's,
it's,

1431
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:26,110
I'm glad that the current administration
at least is calling them out.

1432
00:56:26,140 --> 00:56:28,090
I don't believe it's necessarily going 
to change their behavior,

1433
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:28,781
you know,
and we'll,

1434
00:56:28,781 --> 00:56:29,614
we'll probably get some sort of deal 
where they'll claim to look just a 

1435
00:56:32,110 --> 00:56:32,943
couple of years ago,
they agree with President Obama to stop 

1436
00:56:34,870 --> 00:56:35,703
their cyber shenanigans and they didn't,
so they just changed the way that they 

1437
00:56:39,641 --> 00:56:41,750
did it.
You know,

1438
00:56:41,770 --> 00:56:43,120
that's,
that's the world we live in.

1439
00:56:43,121 --> 00:56:45,220
But I think it is important to make a 
stand.

1440
00:56:45,221 --> 00:56:45,660
Right?

1441
00:56:45,660 --> 00:56:48,630
Yeah.
There's some of that the tech people are

1442
00:56:48,631 --> 00:56:50,670
saying that they think it's 
preposterous.

1443
00:56:50,671 --> 00:56:53,040
When they were talking about the ban on 
android phones,

1444
00:56:53,310 --> 00:56:55,590
some of the tech people say that doesn't
make any sense,

1445
00:56:55,591 --> 00:57:00,270
but what you're saying is it goes far 
beyond the actual phones itself.

1446
00:57:00,271 --> 00:57:01,104
And it's really the,
the mission of the actual company 

1447
00:57:04,051 --> 00:57:04,884
itself.

1448
00:57:05,050 --> 00:57:05,890
Yeah.
I'm saying that,

1449
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:09,430
that there is no way that Huawei and,
and other important

1450
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:15,730
Chinese companies are solely privately 
owned and,

1451
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:16,593
or have the ability to tell the Chinese 
authorities that they will not spy on 

1452
00:57:20,891 --> 00:57:22,670
their behalf.
It just not happen.

1453
00:57:22,690 --> 00:57:24,190
It's just not happening.
You have to,

1454
00:57:24,490 --> 00:57:27,170
you have to go a long ways,
uh,

1455
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:28,443
to come up with that sort of naive 
viewpoint that says that a Chinese 

1456
00:57:33,521 --> 00:57:38,170
company is going to put its foot down 
until present g absolutely not.

1457
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:42,780
We will not do anything to harm another 
nation's country or a company horse.

1458
00:57:42,781 --> 00:57:46,420
Shit they've spent,
they've spent generations now decades,

1459
00:57:46,630 --> 00:57:47,463
uh,
jumpstarting their industry and moving 

1460
00:57:49,691 --> 00:57:50,524
up the food chain on the global economy 
by hoovering up everything possible out 

1461
00:57:53,981 --> 00:57:55,840
there.
So if someone like a

1462
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:58,380
tech wizard got ahold of one of their 
routers,

1463
00:57:58,830 --> 00:57:59,663
can have they been able to detect 
something in there that doesn't belong 

1464
00:58:03,421 --> 00:58:06,780
or some sort of a back door or some sort
of a way that they could tap in.

1465
00:58:07,070 --> 00:58:08,930
It's like if you were,
you know,

1466
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:14,000
you were apple and you were sending data
to Raytheon or whatever and you're going

1467
00:58:14,071 --> 00:58:16,950
back and forth,
they could tap in through that as it had

1468
00:58:16,951 --> 00:58:19,140
been proven that there's a device like 
that.

1469
00:58:19,340 --> 00:58:23,210
Yeah.
A former NSA director Mcconnell back in,

1470
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:26,390
uh,
2015,

1471
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:27,253
I think early 2015 came out and NSA came
out with an official statement and it 

1472
00:58:31,701 --> 00:58:36,701
said every major US corporation of any 
consequence has been,

1473
00:58:37,430 --> 00:58:38,320
um,
uh,

1474
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:42,440
attacked and exploited by Chinese.
And we have never,

1475
00:58:42,441 --> 00:58:45,830
ever not found Chinese malware within 
their systems.

1476
00:58:45,980 --> 00:58:48,620
Wow.
That was ever four years

1477
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:51,680
malware being software.
Right,

1478
00:58:51,710 --> 00:58:52,460
right,
right.

1479
00:58:52,460 --> 00:58:54,560
Is there anything in the hardware 
itself?

1480
00:58:55,470 --> 00:58:56,291
Uh,
yes.

1481
00:58:56,291 --> 00:58:56,801
In,
in,

1482
00:58:56,801 --> 00:58:58,380
in a sense that,
um,

1483
00:58:59,860 --> 00:59:02,050
yes,
in,

1484
00:59:02,190 --> 00:59:06,400
in a sense of like,
I'm trying to remember the name of it,

1485
00:59:06,401 --> 00:59:08,580
but not doing very good job.
Um,

1486
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:12,620
if you have,
uh,

1487
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:16,660
access to or understanding of physical 
hardware,

1488
00:59:18,340 --> 00:59:20,290
then you can,
uh,

1489
00:59:20,291 --> 00:59:21,124
affect easier,
you can affect a physical control of 

1490
00:59:24,411 --> 00:59:25,191
systems.
Right.

1491
00:59:25,191 --> 00:59:26,024
So,
uh,

1492
00:59:26,220 --> 00:59:26,841
stuxnet,
remember,

1493
00:59:26,841 --> 00:59:29,410
I don't know if you remember,
stuxnet was exactly,

1494
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:31,950
it was an attack on Iran.
Um,

1495
00:59:32,150 --> 00:59:33,830
the shut down their nuclear program,
right,

1496
00:59:33,860 --> 00:59:34,790
exactly.
To,

1497
00:59:34,791 --> 00:59:37,130
uh,
essentially what it did was it took over

1498
00:59:37,131 --> 00:59:37,964
control of some centrifuges over spawn.
Them they heated about broke and it was 

1499
00:59:41,421 --> 00:59:42,740
a virus.
And it was,

1500
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:47,760
it was an piece of software that was 
able to impact the,

1501
00:59:47,811 --> 00:59:48,621
the,
you know,

1502
00:59:48,621 --> 00:59:50,690
physical equipment.
Uh,

1503
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:53,630
it took control of those systems,
um,

1504
00:59:53,780 --> 00:59:55,670
because in part,
uh,

1505
00:59:55,700 --> 00:59:59,240
whoever perpetrated it had much better 
understanding of that gear.

1506
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:01,490
Right.
Or had access to that gear.

1507
01:00:02,180 --> 01:00:03,980
And that's a,
that's an important part of,

1508
01:00:04,010 --> 01:00:04,843
of this.
And it's happened several times since 

1509
01:00:05,691 --> 01:00:06,860
then.
And I'm,

1510
01:00:06,870 --> 01:00:08,480
you know,
I'm not disclosing anything because it's

1511
01:00:08,481 --> 01:00:10,910
all it's been written about.
I'm sure it'll be a movie at some point,

1512
01:00:10,911 --> 01:00:12,020
but,
um,

1513
01:00:12,380 --> 01:00:13,580
that is,
uh,

1514
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:15,073
that's a concern.
I'm far more worried about a company 

1515
01:00:17,451 --> 01:00:20,930
like Huawei with,
it's a integration into,

1516
01:00:20,980 --> 01:00:22,130
uh,
allied,

1517
01:00:22,490 --> 01:00:24,080
um,
our allies,

1518
01:00:24,380 --> 01:00:25,213
uh,
telecommunications systems than I am 

1519
01:00:27,411 --> 01:00:29,750
about sort of the individual sale of 
phones.

1520
01:00:29,751 --> 01:00:31,400
And you know what that means,
that look,

1521
01:00:31,670 --> 01:00:32,503
you know,
Amazon and all the others are gathering 

1522
01:00:33,501 --> 01:00:37,070
more data on the average American then,
you know,

1523
01:00:37,150 --> 01:00:37,983
uh,
US government or anybody else's 

1524
01:00:39,020 --> 01:00:41,030
government is doing it at this point.
Let me ask you this,

1525
01:00:41,031 --> 01:00:44,110
cause this is something that just came 
up and we were trying to figure out with

1526
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:44,953
nonsense or not.

1527
01:00:45,110 --> 01:00:45,943
My friend Adam was here the other day 
and we're talking about Toyota trucks 

1528
01:00:48,770 --> 01:00:52,100
and he didn't Google Toyota trucks just 
discussing it.

1529
01:00:52,101 --> 01:00:52,934
And he said since then his mentions had 
been filled with these little 

1530
01:00:56,241 --> 01:01:00,380
advertisements for Toyota trucks.
How's that work?

1531
01:01:01,700 --> 01:01:03,830
Um,
you know how you talk to Siri?

1532
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:04,993
Yes.
Yeah.

1533
01:01:05,030 --> 01:01:05,940
Um,
it,

1534
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:08,510
it's,
it's simple voice rec recognition.

1535
01:01:08,511 --> 01:01:08,901
It,
it's,

1536
01:01:08,901 --> 01:01:10,970
it's a carry over from the old days of 
you know,

1537
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,790
optical readers and how,
you know,

1538
01:01:13,791 --> 01:01:16,520
we all thought it was incredible that 
you could take a piece of paper,

1539
01:01:16,521 --> 01:01:17,354
put into a system and it would like take
that information that was on that piece 

1540
01:01:19,761 --> 01:01:22,820
of paper and now it was on a database 
that you could access and manipulate.

1541
01:01:23,210 --> 01:01:23,991
And so,
you know,

1542
01:01:23,991 --> 01:01:26,270
voice recognition is no different in the
sense that,

1543
01:01:26,271 --> 01:01:27,500
so if,
if,

1544
01:01:27,530 --> 01:01:32,120
if for example,
if I had this switched on and it happens

1545
01:01:32,121 --> 01:01:32,954
to people on the,
I'm sure all the time walking around 

1546
01:01:34,281 --> 01:01:35,114
their house,
they'll say something and all of a 

1547
01:01:35,691 --> 01:01:37,820
sudden Alexa will come on and go,
oh,

1548
01:01:37,821 --> 01:01:39,530
I couldn't find a result for that.

1549
01:01:39,530 --> 01:01:41,600
But do you want to listen to Ella 
Fitzgerald or whatever?

1550
01:01:42,860 --> 01:01:44,660
It's always on.
It's always listening,

1551
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:45,593
right?
And you can do that with anything like 

1552
01:01:46,521 --> 01:01:49,280
this TV right here if you want it to.
A few,

1553
01:01:49,310 --> 01:01:50,143
if I knew that TV was going to go into 
the office of the deputy foreign 

1554
01:01:53,781 --> 01:01:57,620
minister of a country hostile to our 
interests,

1555
01:01:58,340 --> 01:02:00,620
I could turn that thing into a receiver,
obviously.

1556
01:02:00,680 --> 01:02:01,513
Right.
And if I could get my hands on that 

1557
01:02:03,350 --> 01:02:05,600
before delivery,
that's a wonderful thing.

1558
01:02:05,660 --> 01:02:06,493
Now I've got this in there and it's like
the old days when you would have to go 

1559
01:02:09,021 --> 01:02:11,600
in on a,
an entry operation and you know,

1560
01:02:11,601 --> 01:02:13,550
you silent drills and put a,
uh,

1561
01:02:13,630 --> 01:02:15,230
you know,
a device in the wall.

1562
01:02:16,250 --> 01:02:16,970
Now,
you know,

1563
01:02:16,970 --> 01:02:19,020
we've delivered a TV now I get,
I get it,

1564
01:02:19,170 --> 01:02:20,100
you know,
video too.

1565
01:02:20,101 --> 01:02:21,060
Hey,
good for me.

1566
01:02:21,270 --> 01:02:24,230
So that Shit's always on,
you know,

1567
01:02:24,231 --> 01:02:25,170
in a sense.

1568
01:02:25,230 --> 01:02:26,063
And um,
so a regular phone that you get if you 

1569
01:02:27,931 --> 01:02:31,800
just buy an iphone and you have Siri 
turned on so we could say,

1570
01:02:31,801 --> 01:02:32,634
Hey Siri,
and it turns on that phone is always 

1571
01:02:36,241 --> 01:02:37,800
listening to you.
Well,

1572
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:40,260
uh,
then now we're getting in over my head,

1573
01:02:40,290 --> 01:02:41,680
but it could be,
I mean,

1574
01:02:41,681 --> 01:02:42,780
it is,
is it possible?

1575
01:02:42,781 --> 01:02:44,280
Is it,
is it capable of doing that?

1576
01:02:44,310 --> 01:02:46,020
Yes.
Could you do that?

1577
01:02:46,310 --> 01:02:48,210
Um,
uh,

1578
01:02:48,750 --> 01:02:50,790
as an intentional operation?
Sure.

1579
01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:51,953
Um,
is it happening because apple wants to 

1580
01:02:54,091 --> 01:02:54,924
do it and they want to get better 
understanding of consumer preferences 

1581
01:02:57,031 --> 01:02:57,864
and things?
I have no idea that that's above my pay 

1582
01:02:59,011 --> 01:02:59,844
grade.
But I will say from an operational 

1583
01:03:01,621 --> 01:03:02,431
perspective,
sure.

1584
01:03:02,431 --> 01:03:04,230
Yeah.
You from an operational perspective,

1585
01:03:04,231 --> 01:03:05,064
right.
But like it would kind of be scandalous 

1586
01:03:06,601 --> 01:03:09,930
if we found out that apple is listen to 
everything that you say and then they're

1587
01:03:09,931 --> 01:03:10,764
sending them information to these 
companies and then they're trying to 

1588
01:03:12,691 --> 01:03:14,220
sell you whatever you were bringing it 
up.

1589
01:03:14,610 --> 01:03:15,421
But it's one,
it's really,

1590
01:03:15,421 --> 01:03:16,254
if you think about it,
it's only one step above what they do 

1591
01:03:17,371 --> 01:03:18,270
anyway,
which is,

1592
01:03:18,390 --> 01:03:20,100
I mean,
if I go in here and I searched Toyota,

1593
01:03:20,370 --> 01:03:20,791
right?
You know,

1594
01:03:20,791 --> 01:03:22,140
I'm an,
I'm in the same situation.

1595
01:03:22,141 --> 01:03:24,520
I'm fucking inundated with Toyota 
mentions right after.

1596
01:03:24,930 --> 01:03:26,400
So,
you know,

1597
01:03:26,460 --> 01:03:30,480
it's,
it's like the next iteration of that.

1598
01:03:30,750 --> 01:03:35,750
And I suspect that people would,
you know,

1599
01:03:36,330 --> 01:03:40,020
that some folks would be outraged,
but I'll bet people would just live with

1600
01:03:40,021 --> 01:03:40,760
it.
Right.

1601
01:03:40,760 --> 01:03:42,660
We seem to be willing to give up a lot 
of shit,

1602
01:03:43,020 --> 01:03:43,853
you know,
as long as we don't think that 

1603
01:03:44,370 --> 01:03:46,440
governments doing it right.
If it's,

1604
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:48,900
if it's google,
if it's Google in somebody,

1605
01:03:48,901 --> 01:03:50,790
we seem to be fine with it.
But if it's like,

1606
01:03:50,820 --> 01:03:52,320
fuck it,
if it's at NSA,

1607
01:03:52,321 --> 01:03:57,240
then now our best,
but that's not who's fucking making jack

1608
01:03:57,241 --> 01:03:57,930
off of these things.

1609
01:03:57,930 --> 01:03:58,441
Right?
Right.

1610
01:03:58,441 --> 01:03:59,274
So it's Amazon,
Google and all these companies that are 

1611
01:04:01,501 --> 01:04:03,690
using it to sell your data to make a lot
of money.

1612
01:04:04,020 --> 01:04:05,070
Anyway.
What do you got Jamie?

1613
01:04:05,220 --> 01:04:07,470
Centers call for investigation of 
T-mobile,

1614
01:04:07,500 --> 01:04:08,333
sprint,
verizon and att and t for selling 

1615
01:04:10,051 --> 01:04:14,640
location data.
Phone companies know where you are.

1616
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:15,953
Lawmakers want them to stop selling that
information until they could figure out 

1617
01:04:19,411 --> 01:04:21,240
how to tax it.
That seems,

1618
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:24,540
what do they sell in that location?
Data for?

1619
01:04:24,550 --> 01:04:26,580
They want to know how many people are in
certain areas.

1620
01:04:26,581 --> 01:04:27,414
Is that the idea?
Is that the APP is telling you where 

1621
01:04:28,021 --> 01:04:28,854
anyone could,
you can buy that information and find 

1622
01:04:30,811 --> 01:04:34,440
anybody's a location.
But look,

1623
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:37,420
they do these things now where there's a
billboard,

1624
01:04:37,470 --> 01:04:38,760
they'll put a billboard up in a,
in a,

1625
01:04:38,761 --> 01:04:39,900
in a square,
right?

1626
01:04:40,170 --> 01:04:43,320
Um,
and you'll walk by and the billboard has

1627
01:04:43,321 --> 01:04:45,870
the ability to see where the eyeballs 
are,

1628
01:04:45,900 --> 01:04:46,590
right?

1629
01:04:46,590 --> 01:04:48,030
So you'll look and they'll say,
oh yeah,

1630
01:04:48,031 --> 01:04:50,430
it's looking at me that bill boys 
looking at me.

1631
01:04:50,490 --> 01:04:51,990
So that's a success,
right?

1632
01:04:51,991 --> 01:04:55,110
I've scored a hit or a view and that was
the old days.

1633
01:04:55,111 --> 01:04:56,250
It was like,
you know how you know,

1634
01:04:56,251 --> 01:04:59,040
how many clicks or how many fields where
it's got a camera.

1635
01:04:59,060 --> 01:04:59,893
There's a,
there's a ability for that billboard to 

1636
01:05:01,111 --> 01:05:01,891
sense.
And again,

1637
01:05:01,891 --> 01:05:02,724
this,
I go overboard if I start talking 

1638
01:05:03,721 --> 01:05:05,250
technical and someone will call me out 
and say,

1639
01:05:05,251 --> 01:05:06,690
well,
that's not exactly how it works.

1640
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:08,970
But uh,
in simplistic terms,

1641
01:05:08,971 --> 01:05:09,511
yeah,
it's a,

1642
01:05:09,511 --> 01:05:12,530
it's an ability to monitor,
um,

1643
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:16,530
pedestrian traffic to understand,
you know,

1644
01:05:16,531 --> 01:05:19,670
uh,
people's interests and to further refine

1645
01:05:19,671 --> 01:05:20,920
so that they can sell a shit better.

1646
01:05:21,130 --> 01:05:23,930
Mac,
your outdoor advertising interactive,

1647
01:05:23,990 --> 01:05:25,500
this is putting your phone directly up 
to it.

1648
01:05:25,501 --> 01:05:28,850
This,
this is like you committing that Ooh,

1649
01:05:28,870 --> 01:05:29,703
there,
but there is also what he's talking 

1650
01:05:30,681 --> 01:05:32,800
about to this,
what he started with.

1651
01:05:32,810 --> 01:05:34,220
This guy's talking about,
what's his name again?

1652
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:39,050
Who Was it?
So this you walk up to a phone that's in

1653
01:05:39,051 --> 01:05:41,510
the photo,
you hold your phone up to it,

1654
01:05:41,511 --> 01:05:42,344
it sends a signal to your phone.
It seems like it's always Samsung knows 

1655
01:05:44,900 --> 01:05:46,130
it.
Only Samsung phones.

1656
01:05:46,220 --> 01:05:48,850
Maybe just a galaxy.
Add this advertisement.

1657
01:05:48,890 --> 01:05:50,810
I have a song for you.
These are galaxy ads,

1658
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:55,400
but if you can do a one way transaction,
that transaction can be two away easily,

1659
01:05:55,401 --> 01:05:55,941
obviously.
Right.

1660
01:05:55,941 --> 01:05:58,320
And it has to be to some degree because 
there has to be an exchange of,

1661
01:05:58,590 --> 01:05:59,121
of,
you know,

1662
01:05:59,121 --> 01:05:59,954
sort of a handshake.
So I didn't know that billboards are 

1663
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:03,230
staring at you though.
Yeah,

1664
01:06:03,320 --> 01:06:03,771
no,
it's,

1665
01:06:03,771 --> 01:06:04,940
it's,
it's a new,

1666
01:06:05,090 --> 01:06:06,170
pretty crazy shit.
Look,

1667
01:06:06,171 --> 01:06:07,004
I mean,
this you can tracking now understanding 

1668
01:06:08,931 --> 01:06:09,764
where people are,

1669
01:06:09,860 --> 01:06:11,660
right?
As an example,

1670
01:06:12,380 --> 01:06:14,250
uh,
you know,

1671
01:06:14,260 --> 01:06:15,710
it used to be putting a beacon,
right?

1672
01:06:15,711 --> 01:06:16,640
Investigations,
you know,

1673
01:06:16,641 --> 01:06:18,300
you put a beacon on a car,
right?

1674
01:06:18,301 --> 01:06:19,850
And you'd,
and it was a little clumsy,

1675
01:06:19,851 --> 01:06:21,500
but it got better and better as you go 
along.

1676
01:06:21,501 --> 01:06:22,790
You know,
now it's now it's,

1677
01:06:22,791 --> 01:06:23,361
it's,
uh,

1678
01:06:23,361 --> 01:06:24,590
it's,
it's pretty remarkable,

1679
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:28,160
but you can also think about the 
electronics that exist in a,

1680
01:06:28,161 --> 01:06:30,610
in a current vehicle and a new vehicle.
Um,

1681
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:31,633
you can,
every one of those has a unique 

1682
01:06:32,751 --> 01:06:35,480
signature.
So whether it's the tire pressure,

1683
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:36,501
uh,
indicators,

1684
01:06:36,501 --> 01:06:38,090
you know,
how you get in your car and it says your

1685
01:06:38,091 --> 01:06:40,220
left front tire is low.
Right?

1686
01:06:40,430 --> 01:06:42,020
Well,
that's a particular signal.

1687
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:45,260
If I know that signal for that car,
I'll bet I can find that car.

1688
01:06:45,350 --> 01:06:46,610
Right.
And it's like,

1689
01:06:46,611 --> 01:06:49,880
it's the same with all the other 
electronics that exist within a vehicle.

1690
01:06:50,140 --> 01:06:50,973
Um,
or just in the shit that we carry 

1691
01:06:52,881 --> 01:06:54,860
around.
They've all got some kind of signature.

1692
01:06:54,861 --> 01:06:56,570
So I,
but again,

1693
01:06:56,600 --> 01:06:57,433
I think most people are willing to give 
up a surprising amount of privacy for 

1694
01:07:01,131 --> 01:07:03,260
whatever reason.
Maybe because they're getting accustomed

1695
01:07:03,261 --> 01:07:04,870
to it and they're not shocked by 
shooting.

1696
01:07:05,340 --> 01:07:07,190
Jamie,
what were you saying today that somebody

1697
01:07:07,191 --> 01:07:08,024
made a slip up about phone calls?
That the thing you were saying about 

1698
01:07:11,361 --> 01:07:11,870
the,
um,

1699
01:07:11,870 --> 01:07:13,730
the different data that they've 
collected.

1700
01:07:15,460 --> 01:07:19,070
You were just telling me before the show
about the what?

1701
01:07:19,090 --> 01:07:19,923
The some investigation.
That was it that the thing that I was 

1702
01:07:23,281 --> 01:07:25,620
just talking about.
We find anybody's phone.

1703
01:07:25,770 --> 01:07:26,603
No,
you were saying that through the emails 

1704
01:07:28,411 --> 01:07:31,740
and phone up phone calls and the guide 
fucked up by saying phone calls.

1705
01:07:33,410 --> 01:07:37,640
I'm having a brain a he just told me 
before the show.

1706
01:07:38,090 --> 01:07:41,140
But then thinking about a lot of stuff,
smoking a lot of stuff.

1707
01:07:41,330 --> 01:07:44,100
I got a lot of shit on my mind right to 
brain with that.

1708
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:45,353
Now I'm still thinking about that 
hallway thing we were talking about 

1709
01:07:47,871 --> 01:07:48,780
right before.
If you remember it.

1710
01:07:49,370 --> 01:07:50,203
No big deal.
I think it had something to do with the 

1711
01:07:50,841 --> 01:07:54,130
Mueller investigation.
Yeah.

1712
01:07:54,490 --> 01:07:57,460
Yeah.
What do you think wins that can end fuck

1713
01:07:58,600 --> 01:07:59,433
that guy.
It's just that means he would scare the 

1714
01:08:01,001 --> 01:08:02,920
shit out of me if he was looking at my 
life.

1715
01:08:03,190 --> 01:08:05,170
Cause it seems like that guy takes his 
time,

1716
01:08:05,560 --> 01:08:09,550
but about two years of worth of time.
One thing I've got,

1717
01:08:09,570 --> 01:08:12,120
I remember it was the national security 
adviser on CNN last night.

1718
01:08:12,130 --> 01:08:15,060
He was talking about Bill Barr is,

1719
01:08:16,440 --> 01:08:17,273
um,
the access to information he would 

1720
01:08:19,191 --> 01:08:22,460
already have and,
and it'll also be gaining,

1721
01:08:22,461 --> 01:08:24,050
I guess by becoming the Attorney 
General.

1722
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:26,450
They were discussing whether he will,
um,

1723
01:08:27,350 --> 01:08:29,660
uh,
to share all the information coming out.

1724
01:08:29,661 --> 01:08:31,010
They wanted them to commit to doing 
that.

1725
01:08:31,011 --> 01:08:31,844
And it was just sort of saying,
I can't commit because I don't know 

1726
01:08:33,471 --> 01:08:34,304
what's in there yet.
And they were just sort of like giving 

1727
01:08:35,931 --> 01:08:37,340
their both their sides.
I'm like,

1728
01:08:37,341 --> 01:08:38,750
well,
he could know what he would know,

1729
01:08:38,900 --> 01:08:41,510
what he will know.
That's all I was sort of saying.

1730
01:08:41,511 --> 01:08:42,344
And he sorta cut himself off of sharing 
about how much information this guy 

1731
01:08:46,851 --> 01:08:47,990
might have access to.
It sort of,

1732
01:08:48,020 --> 01:08:49,460
it seemed like it.
And he was,

1733
01:08:49,461 --> 01:08:52,190
the former national security advisor,
I believe was all that was.

1734
01:08:52,840 --> 01:08:53,673
So one of the things that everybody was 
scared of was that the NSA was building 

1735
01:08:56,831 --> 01:08:57,664
some gigantic place somewhere outside of
Salt Lake where they would store every 

1736
01:09:02,231 --> 01:09:06,700
single phone call that you ever made,
every single email.

1737
01:09:07,840 --> 01:09:09,040
Yeah.
Uh,

1738
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:10,430
it,
that's,

1739
01:09:10,430 --> 01:09:12,880
that there was that whole stink at one 
point about,

1740
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:15,250
uh,
what they were actually holding on to,

1741
01:09:15,280 --> 01:09:16,113
right.
The collection of information and there 

1742
01:09:17,081 --> 01:09:21,130
was some misreporting about how they've 
actually got your phone calls,

1743
01:09:21,180 --> 01:09:21,821
what would,
they've got us,

1744
01:09:21,821 --> 01:09:24,820
they've got number and duration of call.
Right?

1745
01:09:24,821 --> 01:09:25,654
I mean that's,
that's the key pieces of information 

1746
01:09:26,711 --> 01:09:28,210
that they've got.
Um,

1747
01:09:28,330 --> 01:09:30,190
could they at some point,
you know,

1748
01:09:30,220 --> 01:09:33,370
suddenly decide you're a target of 
interest and so we won't,

1749
01:09:33,580 --> 01:09:35,440
we will start collecting on your calls.
Yeah.

1750
01:09:35,470 --> 01:09:39,210
But was the NSA gathering everybody's 
phone conversations now,

1751
01:09:39,390 --> 01:09:42,490
but it used to be a thing that you would
have to wire tap somebody.

1752
01:09:42,730 --> 01:09:46,450
Like if you're going after the mob,
they had a dad install a bug,

1753
01:09:46,780 --> 01:09:48,620
but they don't have to do that anymore.
No.

1754
01:09:48,650 --> 01:09:49,091
Oh No,
no,

1755
01:09:49,091 --> 01:09:49,391
no,
no.

1756
01:09:49,391 --> 01:09:50,830
I mean tech technology now it's,
I mean,

1757
01:09:50,831 --> 01:09:52,060
I remember the old days of,
of,

1758
01:09:52,061 --> 01:09:52,990
uh,
operations,

1759
01:09:52,991 --> 01:09:53,441
right?
I mean,

1760
01:09:53,441 --> 01:09:54,910
if we wanted to do a,
we're overseas,

1761
01:09:54,930 --> 01:09:55,763
it's compounded incredibly,
it's May really difficult to do 

1762
01:09:58,271 --> 01:10:00,520
observation posts and listening posts 
and everything overseas,

1763
01:10:00,521 --> 01:10:01,720
right.
Cause it's not your turf.

1764
01:10:02,080 --> 01:10:05,500
And so you've got to come up with a,
I'm an air tight plan,

1765
01:10:05,560 --> 01:10:08,530
but it was the same way.
You still had to get physical access,

1766
01:10:08,531 --> 01:10:10,930
right to phone lines.
He had that yet the clip off and you had

1767
01:10:10,931 --> 01:10:11,471
to,
you know,

1768
01:10:11,471 --> 01:10:12,760
then you have to figure out where am I 
putting the,

1769
01:10:12,790 --> 01:10:14,530
the gear,
where am I going to put the batteries?

1770
01:10:14,531 --> 01:10:15,670
How am I going to store this shit?

1771
01:10:15,680 --> 01:10:17,510
And then you got listened to it,
right?

1772
01:10:17,511 --> 01:10:18,760
And you've got to,
you start,

1773
01:10:18,910 --> 01:10:20,530
what happens is it starts collecting 
like this.

1774
01:10:20,531 --> 01:10:21,880
You start getting mountains,
so tapes,

1775
01:10:21,881 --> 01:10:23,770
right?
And you're not getting it real time,

1776
01:10:23,771 --> 01:10:25,720
which is a problem.
But nowadays,

1777
01:10:25,721 --> 01:10:26,860
no,
it's entirely different.

1778
01:10:27,190 --> 01:10:29,110
Um,
but I think,

1779
01:10:29,111 --> 01:10:30,880
you know,
if,

1780
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:35,320
if we,
if we look at today's concerns,

1781
01:10:35,321 --> 01:10:36,154
right?
If we look at what are people worried 

1782
01:10:37,931 --> 01:10:39,850
about,
what should they be worried about?

1783
01:10:40,330 --> 01:10:42,910
Um,
I know that privacy always comes up.

1784
01:10:42,940 --> 01:10:45,670
People always talk about it.
And I guess I keep going back to my same

1785
01:10:45,671 --> 01:10:46,504
point,
which was I,

1786
01:10:47,320 --> 01:10:52,320
I don't see people with pitchforks and 
the torches going down a complainant,

1787
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:54,230
Jeff Bezos that,
you know,

1788
01:10:54,370 --> 01:10:57,210
Amazon's collecting massive amounts of 
data or you know,

1789
01:10:57,230 --> 01:10:58,063
t mobile and sprint and all of these are
our mapping our locations as we move 

1790
01:11:00,401 --> 01:11:02,320
around.
I just don't see it.

1791
01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:03,153
I mean,
that probably raised nobody's interest 

1792
01:11:04,451 --> 01:11:05,470
for the most part.
You know,

1793
01:11:05,471 --> 01:11:07,850
that article that you just pulled up.
Um,

1794
01:11:08,260 --> 01:11:09,580
and I,
you know,

1795
01:11:09,700 --> 01:11:10,533
I guess in part it's because we become 
kind of used to it become accustomed to 

1796
01:11:14,521 --> 01:11:15,030
it,
so,

1797
01:11:15,030 --> 01:11:15,863
so fine.
But,

1798
01:11:16,140 --> 01:11:17,580
you know,
what should we be worried about?

1799
01:11:17,581 --> 01:11:18,414
Well,
I'll tell you what we should boy up 

1800
01:11:18,870 --> 01:11:19,703
mostly is a state sponsored activity by 
countries whose interests almost never 

1801
01:11:25,561 --> 01:11:28,500
aligned with ours now would include,
China certainly includes Russia,

1802
01:11:28,890 --> 01:11:30,110
was Iran.
The,

1803
01:11:30,510 --> 01:11:33,920
the shit that they're doing.
China has a policy,

1804
01:11:34,550 --> 01:11:36,720
um,
information domination,

1805
01:11:36,910 --> 01:11:37,743
right?
Which means they've determined that the 

1806
01:11:39,781 --> 01:11:44,220
next war,
the next modern large scale war is going

1807
01:11:44,221 --> 01:11:47,520
to be one by whoever has control over 
information.

1808
01:11:47,910 --> 01:11:49,980
So where are they putting all their 
resources?

1809
01:11:49,981 --> 01:11:52,440
China knows that they're not going to 
build a military that's going to be able

1810
01:11:52,441 --> 01:11:54,150
to reach around the globe for the most 
part.

1811
01:11:54,180 --> 01:11:54,901
Although they're,
you know,

1812
01:11:54,901 --> 01:11:57,060
they're beefing up their resources.
What are they doing?

1813
01:11:57,210 --> 01:11:59,820
It's cyber and it's space,
right?

1814
01:11:59,940 --> 01:12:00,773
So I know a lot of people were,
were kicking the president in the ass 

1815
01:12:03,060 --> 01:12:05,280
and laughing about space for us because 
it is funny,

1816
01:12:05,340 --> 01:12:07,620
right?
But the uniforms would be amazing.

1817
01:12:07,621 --> 01:12:09,420
But they,
they talk about this,

1818
01:12:10,110 --> 01:12:10,943
but China honestly believes and it's 
putting their resources into cyber and 

1819
01:12:14,131 --> 01:12:15,330
to space.
And what does that mean,

1820
01:12:15,370 --> 01:12:16,203
wolf?
They're anti satellite technology that 

1821
01:12:17,971 --> 01:12:20,340
they've been developing and working on 
and continue to work on.

1822
01:12:20,760 --> 01:12:21,593
The whole point of that is to take 
control of communications and 

1823
01:12:23,701 --> 01:12:27,660
surveillance abilities,
whether it's ours or allies in the event

1824
01:12:27,661 --> 01:12:28,494
of something major that happens.
So they would have the ability to shut 

1825
01:12:31,141 --> 01:12:32,430
off our silence.
No,

1826
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:34,500
and if you do that,
then what does that mean?

1827
01:12:34,501 --> 01:12:35,340
Well,
it means you're blind,

1828
01:12:35,341 --> 01:12:36,174
right?
And will suddenly walking around with 

1829
01:12:37,351 --> 01:12:38,360
compasses and maps,
you know,

1830
01:12:38,380 --> 01:12:40,730
trying to shoot an asthma,
then figuring out where the hell,

1831
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,700
you know,
the target is.

1832
01:12:42,050 --> 01:12:42,883
So China is currently developing that or
they have developed something that 

1833
01:12:46,630 --> 01:12:47,760
they're working on it now.
Yeah.

1834
01:12:47,761 --> 01:12:49,800
They're working on now developed.
They developed some of it.

1835
01:12:49,810 --> 01:12:50,643
They're,
they're working to get the next 

1836
01:12:51,181 --> 01:12:52,014
generation.
It's like every nation that has the 

1837
01:12:53,131 --> 01:12:56,160
resources and ability understands that 
and is doing the same.

1838
01:12:56,161 --> 01:13:00,450
It's not like we're not,
what is their excuse was they should,

1839
01:13:00,451 --> 01:13:01,620
but they don't have an excuse.
They just,

1840
01:13:01,980 --> 01:13:04,020
they understand they have the right to 
do it.

1841
01:13:04,021 --> 01:13:04,770
I mean,
it's not like they,

1842
01:13:04,770 --> 01:13:05,610
they,
you know,

1843
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:07,950
right.
As long as it don't use it right.

1844
01:13:07,951 --> 01:13:10,080
And in an illegal way,
they have the right to develop the tech.

1845
01:13:10,110 --> 01:13:10,943
It's like there's no treaty that says 
you can't develop anti satellite 

1846
01:13:13,891 --> 01:13:14,551
technology.
Right.

1847
01:13:14,551 --> 01:13:15,050
There's,
there's,

1848
01:13:15,050 --> 01:13:17,010
there's the start treaties.
There's the nuclear,

1849
01:13:17,030 --> 01:13:18,990
you know,
conventions that we have with Russia,

1850
01:13:18,991 --> 01:13:22,410
which isn't a whole nother interesting 
topic because we're now arguing with the

1851
01:13:22,411 --> 01:13:24,300
Russians over over,
uh,

1852
01:13:24,370 --> 01:13:25,203
the,
the latest nuke agreement that took 

1853
01:13:27,451 --> 01:13:28,470
place some time ago.

1854
01:13:28,770 --> 01:13:30,390
Uh,
it's,

1855
01:13:30,391 --> 01:13:32,160
uh,
coming up for renewal sometime soon,

1856
01:13:32,370 --> 01:13:33,203
your a year or two years from now.
And the Russians had been cheating on a 

1857
01:13:36,451 --> 01:13:37,284
previous agreement.
And so we're know now they tried to say 

1858
01:13:39,211 --> 01:13:41,520
we're cheating on the new one.
And so that's an interesting thing to be

1859
01:13:41,521 --> 01:13:42,354
watching.
But the point being is that there's 

1860
01:13:44,491 --> 01:13:49,491
conventions that try to control the,
the numbers for warheads or for delivery

1861
01:13:50,521 --> 01:13:51,750
mechanisms,
missiles or,

1862
01:13:51,751 --> 01:13:52,411
or,
or,

1863
01:13:52,411 --> 01:13:53,250
uh,
submarines,

1864
01:13:53,251 --> 01:13:57,030
whatever bombers,
but not for this new world.

1865
01:13:57,150 --> 01:13:57,983
Cyberspace.
The Pentagon's still trying to figure 

1866
01:13:58,861 --> 01:13:59,730
out what,
uh,

1867
01:13:59,750 --> 01:14:01,080
you know,
a war,

1868
01:14:01,400 --> 01:14:03,060
uh,
means in cyberspace,

1869
01:14:03,510 --> 01:14:03,930
right.
You know,

1870
01:14:03,930 --> 01:14:05,370
how do you respond?
What do you know,

1871
01:14:05,410 --> 01:14:06,780
what,
what's the threshold,

1872
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:09,150
you know,
and then what's an appropriate response?

1873
01:14:09,680 --> 01:14:10,740
Um,
and so,

1874
01:14:10,930 --> 01:14:12,070
well,
maybe we'll get there.

1875
01:14:12,071 --> 01:14:12,904
Maybe we'll start having these 
discussions and create treaties that 

1876
01:14:14,831 --> 01:14:16,060
will allow that.
But right now,

1877
01:14:16,180 --> 01:14:17,920
from China's perspective,
again,

1878
01:14:17,921 --> 01:14:18,754
not to beat on China,
but I'm much more concerned about China 

1879
01:14:21,191 --> 01:14:22,390
for our national security.

1880
01:14:22,470 --> 01:14:25,240
There are a much bigger concern than 
Russia is.

1881
01:14:25,241 --> 01:14:27,460
Russia is punching above its weight and 
potent,

1882
01:14:27,480 --> 01:14:28,390
you know,
Putin's a Dick,

1883
01:14:28,420 --> 01:14:29,560
no doubt about it.
Right?

1884
01:14:29,770 --> 01:14:32,890
And they've doing what they always do,
which is metal and democracy.

1885
01:14:32,950 --> 01:14:37,150
That's been their methodology for ever 
since they've been around.

1886
01:14:38,170 --> 01:14:39,003
But you know that that's small potatoes.
They got the GDP of a small European 

1887
01:14:43,211 --> 01:14:44,350
country,
you know,

1888
01:14:44,351 --> 01:14:45,940
and when the oil prices,
you know,

1889
01:14:45,941 --> 01:14:48,490
are in the toilet,
they really are sucking wind.

1890
01:14:49,270 --> 01:14:50,103
So yeah,
we gotta be concerned with Russia and 

1891
01:14:51,221 --> 01:14:53,500
understand that their interests were 
never aligned with ours.

1892
01:14:53,560 --> 01:14:54,880
You know,
for the most part may be,

1893
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:58,180
we tried to imagine they were with Syria
and isis and everything,

1894
01:14:58,690 --> 01:14:59,523
but Russia is only interested there was 
maintaining their leverage and 

1895
01:15:01,091 --> 01:15:01,924
increasing it and not,
not losing their military foothold 

1896
01:15:04,091 --> 01:15:06,490
there.
That was their primary interest.

1897
01:15:07,240 --> 01:15:11,140
We mirror our values and we mirror our 
interest on other countries.

1898
01:15:11,140 --> 01:15:14,350
And so we imagined that somehow we're 
all in this fight against Isis together.

1899
01:15:15,140 --> 01:15:16,420
Oh Shit.
You know,

1900
01:15:16,450 --> 01:15:18,620
so,
so yeah,

1901
01:15:18,780 --> 01:15:19,613
China's a much bigger issue and we,
and we should be focused on that and to 

1902
01:15:23,411 --> 01:15:25,510
some degree this administration is,
so that's where I say,

1903
01:15:25,511 --> 01:15:26,344
look,
you can't just keep complaining and 

1904
01:15:28,031 --> 01:15:30,550
bitching and moaning because you don't 
like president trump.

1905
01:15:30,770 --> 01:15:31,603
There are certain things that are going 
on that you should be willing to say 

1906
01:15:33,550 --> 01:15:34,181
that.
Okay,

1907
01:15:34,181 --> 01:15:36,610
that makes sense.
Maybe I don't like the messenger,

1908
01:15:36,790 --> 01:15:40,630
but that part of it makes sense.
Is it his personal life?

1909
01:15:40,690 --> 01:15:41,523
I mean it was it because of his dealings
with China from the business world that 

1910
01:15:45,041 --> 01:15:49,370
he understands it better,
that he's more concerned with the,

1911
01:15:49,410 --> 01:15:51,670
the imbalance of the,
the trade.

1912
01:15:52,300 --> 01:15:54,970
I think what happened was what do,
I know this is speculation,

1913
01:15:54,971 --> 01:15:55,804
so hey,
but I suspect that what happened was he 

1914
01:15:58,211 --> 01:15:59,980
came into it,
um,

1915
01:16:00,160 --> 01:16:01,960
focused on the trade imbalance.

1916
01:16:02,230 --> 01:16:03,063
Right.
And as he was sitting there and talking 

1917
01:16:05,231 --> 01:16:06,064
about the trade balance,
more of the conversation from the 

1918
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,970
National Security Council and from the 
agency and others in terms of saying,

1919
01:16:12,971 --> 01:16:13,271
well,
yeah,

1920
01:16:13,271 --> 01:16:16,660
this is part of the reason why and this 
is the long longterm effects of,

1921
01:16:16,710 --> 01:16:17,543
of their theft of intellectual property.
This is why in part they've been 

1922
01:16:19,511 --> 01:16:20,344
successful in these areas.
So I think there was probably more and 

1923
01:16:22,661 --> 01:16:25,210
more discussion talking about,
uh,

1924
01:16:25,240 --> 01:16:26,200
their,
uh,

1925
01:16:26,230 --> 01:16:30,130
economic espionage and theft of Ip and 
that became then an issue for him.

1926
01:16:30,550 --> 01:16:32,770
Um,
but I think initially,

1927
01:16:32,771 --> 01:16:33,604
and still to this day,
I think the big issue is just he wants 

1928
01:16:35,501 --> 01:16:39,610
to try to create a win in terms of the 
trade imbalance.

1929
01:16:40,240 --> 01:16:43,000
Russia seems to us here domestically 
leaks,

1930
01:16:43,090 --> 01:16:44,860
speaking from,
for myself,

1931
01:16:44,910 --> 01:16:46,330
when,
when I think about it,

1932
01:16:46,331 --> 01:16:47,164
and I think about the,
the narrative that's been sort of 

1933
01:16:49,750 --> 01:16:53,140
delivered to us said,
Russia is this military danger.

1934
01:16:53,500 --> 01:16:57,190
We're worried about Putin taking over 
other countries.

1935
01:16:57,191 --> 01:17:00,670
We're worried about Putin's power,
the way he kills dissidence,

1936
01:17:00,671 --> 01:17:04,180
the way he kills political opponents and
journalists,

1937
01:17:04,750 --> 01:17:05,583
we think about China.
And even with the walway arrests were 

1938
01:17:08,651 --> 01:17:09,484
like,
Eh,

1939
01:17:09,650 --> 01:17:10,483
no one seems to be concerned.
It doesn't seem to light any bulbs over 

1940
01:17:14,511 --> 01:17:15,680
here.
Now you're right.

1941
01:17:15,710 --> 01:17:17,060
I don't know why that is,
except,

1942
01:17:17,420 --> 01:17:18,253
you know,
Putin is more like a thug and he's a 

1943
01:17:20,001 --> 01:17:21,280
visual.
Right,

1944
01:17:21,430 --> 01:17:22,011
right.
And also,

1945
01:17:22,011 --> 01:17:22,371
I mean,
look,

1946
01:17:22,371 --> 01:17:22,860
I,
you know,

1947
01:17:22,860 --> 01:17:23,693
he's,
he's been very clear about wanting to 

1948
01:17:25,341 --> 01:17:26,174
try to rebuild the Soviet Union.
So whether it's Crimea and the 

1949
01:17:28,011 --> 01:17:28,844
annexation of that,
or where they're taking over eastern 

1950
01:17:29,841 --> 01:17:31,240
Ukraine,
um,

1951
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:32,790
you know,
or,

1952
01:17:32,790 --> 01:17:35,510
or maintaining a position at Georgia,
whatever it is.

1953
01:17:35,930 --> 01:17:36,550
Uh,
you know,

1954
01:17:36,550 --> 01:17:38,090
certainly,
uh,

1955
01:17:38,300 --> 01:17:39,133
you know,
his attacks or the FSB is attacks 

1956
01:17:41,450 --> 01:17:42,630
overseas against,
you know,

1957
01:17:42,680 --> 01:17:44,940
dissidents and others.
Um,

1958
01:17:45,380 --> 01:17:46,730
yeah,
he's just more in your face.

1959
01:17:46,730 --> 01:17:48,090
He's like Tony Soprano.
Right,

1960
01:17:48,091 --> 01:17:49,190
right.
So you can look at that.

1961
01:17:49,310 --> 01:17:50,720
China's always been,
you know,

1962
01:17:50,780 --> 01:17:52,480
sort of this thing,
right.

1963
01:17:52,490 --> 01:17:53,870
And she look,
China's fantastic.

1964
01:17:53,871 --> 01:17:55,550
The history is amazing.
You know,

1965
01:17:55,551 --> 01:17:58,280
the places are incredible.
I think it's,

1966
01:17:58,350 --> 01:18:00,410
you know,
we should be trading with China.

1967
01:18:00,411 --> 01:18:02,480
We should be doing a huge amount of 
business with China.

1968
01:18:02,481 --> 01:18:04,220
We should clear the decks and try to 
agree.

1969
01:18:04,310 --> 01:18:05,143
We can level the playing field,
but we should also be pragmatic and 

1970
01:18:07,041 --> 01:18:11,060
realize what they do in terms of their 
theft of Ip.

1971
01:18:11,450 --> 01:18:13,160
And so,
you know,

1972
01:18:13,161 --> 01:18:14,780
because that again,
that probably won't change,

1973
01:18:14,781 --> 01:18:15,614
but yeah,
we absolutely should be dealing with 

1974
01:18:17,391 --> 01:18:18,224
China all the time.
But I think that they've always kind of 

1975
01:18:20,930 --> 01:18:23,630
been viewed more in more of a 
sophisticated fashion,

1976
01:18:23,631 --> 01:18:25,910
maybe because Putin has just sort of in 
your face.

1977
01:18:26,170 --> 01:18:28,010
Um,
and he's,

1978
01:18:28,011 --> 01:18:28,880
you know,
he's good at it.

1979
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:31,190
He's very successful.
He says he's a smart son of a bitch,

1980
01:18:31,460 --> 01:18:33,440
but he's,
I think he's pretty easy to read,

1981
01:18:33,650 --> 01:18:34,340
right?
He's,

1982
01:18:34,340 --> 01:18:36,550
he's thuggish and,
um,

1983
01:18:36,710 --> 01:18:37,850
he,
you know,

1984
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:40,190
he longs for those days of the Soviet 
Union.

1985
01:18:40,910 --> 01:18:41,743
So we should understand that everything 
he does is because of that is because 

1986
01:18:45,111 --> 01:18:45,860
he's,
he,

1987
01:18:45,860 --> 01:18:47,960
he would love to rebuild the Soviet 
Union.

1988
01:18:48,590 --> 01:18:49,423
And so we shouldn't be surprised by any 
sort of aggressive move that he makes 

1989
01:18:53,511 --> 01:18:55,160
against his,
his neighbors.

1990
01:18:55,161 --> 01:18:57,320
And we should always push back.
Um,

1991
01:18:57,470 --> 01:19:02,060
and to be fair,
this administration,

1992
01:19:02,150 --> 01:19:02,983
not to beat their drum,
but the actions they've taken against 

1993
01:19:06,081 --> 01:19:06,914
Russia,
despite the fact that you've got people 

1994
01:19:08,481 --> 01:19:09,314
calling him a puppet of Putin,
how are more significant than the 

1995
01:19:12,981 --> 01:19:14,480
previous administration took?
Like,

1996
01:19:14,481 --> 01:19:17,690
what has he done the sanctions against,
uh,

1997
01:19:17,720 --> 01:19:18,553
you know,
key individuals and companies within 

1998
01:19:19,911 --> 01:19:20,744
Russia as an example.
Those are the toughest sanctions have 

1999
01:19:22,311 --> 01:19:24,080
been placed on Russia ever.

2000
01:19:24,590 --> 01:19:27,160
Um,
the provision of weapons and a,

2001
01:19:27,170 --> 01:19:29,960
and assistance to the Ukrainians,
right?

2002
01:19:29,961 --> 01:19:31,360
That was something the previous 
administration said,

2003
01:19:31,420 --> 01:19:32,570
no,
not going to do that.

2004
01:19:32,840 --> 01:19:33,800
You know,
cause we don't,

2005
01:19:33,830 --> 01:19:36,080
we don't want any blow back.
Um,

2006
01:19:36,320 --> 01:19:38,000
that's,
that's a good thing,

2007
01:19:38,030 --> 01:19:39,140
right?
That should be done.

2008
01:19:40,010 --> 01:19:42,350
Um,
pushing back against them on the,

2009
01:19:42,380 --> 01:19:45,080
on the 2011 nuke a deal.
Right.

2010
01:19:45,290 --> 01:19:46,101
And,
or sorry,

2011
01:19:46,101 --> 01:19:47,090
on the,
on the previous,

2012
01:19:47,091 --> 01:19:50,540
on the start deal prior to the 2011 deal
and calling them out and saying,

2013
01:19:50,541 --> 01:19:52,990
look,
you're cheating on this and you,

2014
01:19:53,020 --> 01:19:54,950
you know,
you gotta be held accountable.

2015
01:19:55,640 --> 01:19:57,080
I mean,
there's certain things there that,

2016
01:19:57,470 --> 01:20:02,470
that makes sense then that don't add up 
if you talk to somebody who says,

2017
01:20:03,021 --> 01:20:04,100
well,
he's an absolute puppet,

2018
01:20:04,101 --> 01:20:04,551
and you say,
well,

2019
01:20:04,551 --> 01:20:05,301
okay,
he's a puppet,

2020
01:20:05,301 --> 01:20:09,810
so why is he doing certain that seem 
counter to Russian interests?

2021
01:20:10,140 --> 01:20:11,490
And they'll say,
well,

2022
01:20:11,491 --> 01:20:14,280
because he's smart and he's like,
he doesn't want to get caught out.

2023
01:20:14,550 --> 01:20:15,990
I ain't see it's,
he's playing,

2024
01:20:16,020 --> 01:20:17,650
he's playing long game here,
you know,

2025
01:20:17,750 --> 01:20:18,460
and he's,
and,

2026
01:20:18,460 --> 01:20:19,440
and,
and I'm thinking,

2027
01:20:19,441 --> 01:20:20,730
okay,
I,

2028
01:20:20,760 --> 01:20:21,450
you know,
maybe,

2029
01:20:21,450 --> 01:20:22,350
maybe,
who knows?

2030
01:20:22,410 --> 01:20:23,243
But,
uh,

2031
01:20:23,430 --> 01:20:24,263
I haven't,
I haven't strapped on my tin foil hat 

2032
01:20:25,591 --> 01:20:28,170
yet to get to that point.
So I don't know.

2033
01:20:28,650 --> 01:20:29,101
I don't know.
Yeah,

2034
01:20:29,101 --> 01:20:29,934
that seems like a complicated one.
If they have some compromising 

2035
01:20:31,861 --> 01:20:34,830
information about them,
that was always the fear,

2036
01:20:34,831 --> 01:20:35,664
right?
Is that they knew something or maybe it 

2037
01:20:37,381 --> 01:20:40,560
was business dealings.
Maybe it was people peeing on him or,

2038
01:20:40,660 --> 01:20:42,420
yeah.
So I'll get that if they had,

2039
01:20:42,421 --> 01:20:43,560
if they did not.
And again,

2040
01:20:43,810 --> 01:20:46,820
anything I can help in today's world,
anything's possible.

2041
01:20:46,960 --> 01:20:49,980
Right.
And I wish we had somebody else in there

2042
01:20:49,981 --> 01:20:53,910
who was more elegant and eloquent and 
sophisticated and anybody stand out?

2043
01:20:54,230 --> 01:20:57,150
Uh,
not right now.

2044
01:20:57,210 --> 01:20:58,043
No,
I don't think anybody's going to 

2045
01:20:58,641 --> 01:20:59,940
challenge it from the Republican side.

2046
01:20:59,940 --> 01:21:00,773
And on the democratic side,
I think they're going to get 18 to 20 

2047
01:21:03,290 --> 01:21:04,123
you know,
potential candidates and there and beat 

2048
01:21:05,640 --> 01:21:06,640
in their own.
Right.

2049
01:21:06,660 --> 01:21:08,550
So it could be a,
it could be a real,

2050
01:21:08,580 --> 01:21:09,413
you know,
a slug fest and as they're trying to 

2051
01:21:12,151 --> 01:21:14,160
establish someone who's a viable 
candidate,

2052
01:21:14,200 --> 01:21:15,780
kind of like what the Republicans did.
Right.

2053
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:17,160
And we ended up with,
you know,

2054
01:21:17,220 --> 01:21:20,700
we ended up with president trump.
And you know how the Democrats,

2055
01:21:20,701 --> 01:21:23,220
if they're not careful,
you can end up with the same thing.

2056
01:21:23,221 --> 01:21:24,390
Look,
they're talking about Joe Biden.

2057
01:21:24,510 --> 01:21:26,090
I,
Joe Biden's an excellent cat.

2058
01:21:26,100 --> 01:21:27,300
Right?
So 150 years old,

2059
01:21:27,301 --> 01:21:29,280
it's 150 years old and he lost twice 
before.

2060
01:21:29,640 --> 01:21:31,380
But everybody loves the person that's on
the bench,

2061
01:21:31,381 --> 01:21:31,981
right,
right.

2062
01:21:31,981 --> 01:21:33,840
Until they get in the game.
And so,

2063
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:36,360
you know,
who knows where they're going to go with

2064
01:21:36,361 --> 01:21:37,800
that.
But um,

2065
01:21:38,280 --> 01:21:39,113
you know,
could they had this idea that they've 

2066
01:21:40,681 --> 01:21:42,210
got compromising information on them?

2067
01:21:42,810 --> 01:21:44,070
Um,
here's,

2068
01:21:44,300 --> 01:21:45,133
uh,
here's what I think is that if Mueller 

2069
01:21:49,740 --> 01:21:52,590
has figured this out right,
and he's been quiet about it,

2070
01:21:52,591 --> 01:21:53,424
and then the most remarkable thing about
this investigation will be that nobody 

2071
01:21:57,751 --> 01:21:59,020
leaked.
Right?

2072
01:21:59,130 --> 01:22:02,070
Because you can't keep a secret in 
Washington.

2073
01:22:02,490 --> 01:22:06,690
And so the fact that for two years now,
we don't have like that,

2074
01:22:06,691 --> 01:22:08,550
that,
that bullet,

2075
01:22:08,610 --> 01:22:09,443
you know,
that they think they are going to come 

2076
01:22:09,781 --> 01:22:13,410
up with some point.
My inclination is to think that,

2077
01:22:13,560 --> 01:22:14,393
you know,
Molly's gonna Finish this investigation 

2078
01:22:15,960 --> 01:22:18,300
issue some findings and nobody's going 
to be happy,

2079
01:22:18,420 --> 01:22:19,830
right?
Cause there won't be a bullet.

2080
01:22:20,130 --> 01:22:20,963
And so the left won't be happy.
The right won't be happy because he'll 

2081
01:22:23,311 --> 01:22:24,950
still be pointing out the fact that 
there was,

2082
01:22:24,990 --> 01:22:25,950
you know,
a lot of,

2083
01:22:25,951 --> 01:22:26,784
you know,
stupid moves on the campaigns part and 

2084
01:22:28,081 --> 01:22:29,010
that there was,
uh,

2085
01:22:29,011 --> 01:22:30,680
inappropriate activity by,
you know,

2086
01:22:30,720 --> 01:22:32,100
people like manafort and others.

2087
01:22:32,610 --> 01:22:34,080
Uh,
but,

2088
01:22:34,330 --> 01:22:35,810
uh,
do I think there's gonna be some smoking

2089
01:22:35,820 --> 01:22:36,653
gun?
I don't,

2090
01:22:36,750 --> 01:22:39,720
I don't think so because,
and my reason for saying that is because

2091
01:22:39,900 --> 01:22:42,380
I've never known Washington not be able 
to keep or to,

2092
01:22:42,610 --> 01:22:44,640
to be able to keep a secret.
This is the one,

2093
01:22:44,641 --> 01:22:45,474
like,
Mueller ever done one of these things 

2094
01:22:46,171 --> 01:22:48,450
before though.
He seems uniquely calculated.

2095
01:22:48,451 --> 01:22:48,920
Yeah.
He's,

2096
01:22:48,920 --> 01:22:51,270
he's done this before and um,
and he has,

2097
01:22:51,271 --> 01:22:51,661
he's like,
look,

2098
01:22:51,661 --> 01:22:53,940
he's a very smart guy and a very 
seasoned,

2099
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,010
a operator investigator.
Uh,

2100
01:22:56,020 --> 01:22:56,853
and he's got good people working for him
and it's absolutely correct to let them 

2101
01:22:59,431 --> 01:23:02,430
go with this and just let him finish it 
up.

2102
01:23:02,431 --> 01:23:04,830
Right.
But when is that going to be?

2103
01:23:04,831 --> 01:23:05,550
Who knows?
Right,

2104
01:23:05,550 --> 01:23:06,383
right.
Nobody had,

2105
01:23:06,850 --> 01:23:07,661
they've been talking about,
oh,

2106
01:23:07,661 --> 01:23:09,700
he's going to wrap it up next week,
or it's going to wrap it up this week.

2107
01:23:09,701 --> 01:23:10,810
He's going to know.
He's not,

2108
01:23:10,840 --> 01:23:11,673
you know,
he'll,

2109
01:23:12,040 --> 01:23:13,480
you know,
he's thinking he's going to wrap it up.

2110
01:23:13,720 --> 01:23:16,930
Who knows?
This literally could go onto in the eye,

2111
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,660
it's going to have to end before 
probably end of this year.

2112
01:23:19,930 --> 01:23:22,510
I don't think even he's gonna want to 
for political calculations,

2113
01:23:22,540 --> 01:23:24,490
let it go into,
to close to 20,

2114
01:23:24,491 --> 01:23:26,200
20 in the election.
Right.

2115
01:23:26,201 --> 01:23:27,034
So regardless,
even though I don't think he's a 

2116
01:23:28,541 --> 01:23:29,374
particularly political individual,
I think he's going to see the wisdom of 

2117
01:23:31,631 --> 01:23:33,980
wrapping it up before then.
Um,

2118
01:23:34,030 --> 01:23:35,890
and then letting the chips fall wherever
they do.

2119
01:23:36,170 --> 01:23:40,070
What's astonishing to me is how anytime 
something does come out on trump,

2120
01:23:40,071 --> 01:23:42,680
it just seems to slide right off.
Yeah.

2121
01:23:42,810 --> 01:23:44,460
Yeah.
All that is true.

2122
01:23:44,580 --> 01:23:45,413
That is true.
Because I think what's happening is 

2123
01:23:47,191 --> 01:23:49,230
they're just throwing everything out 
there every day.

2124
01:23:49,231 --> 01:23:51,000
Right.
And it much like,

2125
01:23:51,001 --> 01:23:51,834
you know,
our willingness to give up privacy 

2126
01:23:52,771 --> 01:23:53,604
because we keep hearing about another 
hack or another lake or we know that 

2127
01:23:56,911 --> 01:23:59,070
Amazon's doing this or that.
I think w,

2128
01:23:59,130 --> 01:23:59,963
you know,
it's that constant drum beat and that 

2129
01:24:01,201 --> 01:24:03,810
mudslinging and I think the dems haven't
done themselves any favors.

2130
01:24:03,811 --> 01:24:05,790
So the resistance movement of what do we
want to call it?

2131
01:24:06,180 --> 01:24:07,013
Um,
because I think people are just immune 

2132
01:24:08,311 --> 01:24:12,570
to it and it's hardened the trump's base
to think,

2133
01:24:12,600 --> 01:24:14,190
you know,
he's under attack every minute,

2134
01:24:14,240 --> 01:24:15,780
right.
So I gotta support them harder.

2135
01:24:16,280 --> 01:24:18,000
Um,
yeah.

2136
01:24:18,001 --> 01:24:18,781
But uh,
you know,

2137
01:24:18,781 --> 01:24:21,420
who do you think's going to end up in,
in the race?

2138
01:24:21,450 --> 01:24:23,310
I mean,
who's got the best chance?

2139
01:24:23,330 --> 01:24:25,070
It's a good question.
I mean,

2140
01:24:25,420 --> 01:24:27,130
on the left hand side,
the,

2141
01:24:27,190 --> 01:24:29,210
my real fear is that Hillary is going to
run again.

2142
01:24:30,590 --> 01:24:33,380
Sorry,
I almost did one of those TV spit takes.

2143
01:24:33,410 --> 01:24:35,140
It's possible.
Well,

2144
01:24:35,230 --> 01:24:37,130
that lady is crazy.
You know,

2145
01:24:37,160 --> 01:24:39,830
one of the things that she said in one 
of the more recent interviews,

2146
01:24:39,831 --> 01:24:41,720
she said,
I'd like to be president.

2147
01:24:42,050 --> 01:24:42,883
I'd like to be president.
Just what do you want to put it on your 

2148
01:24:46,011 --> 01:24:48,440
resume?
What the fuck does that mean?

2149
01:24:48,710 --> 01:24:52,190
I think I could do a great job and 
turning this country around.

2150
01:24:52,520 --> 01:24:55,730
I have the leadership ability to really 
affect a change.

2151
01:24:55,770 --> 01:24:56,081
No,
no,

2152
01:24:56,081 --> 01:24:57,620
no.
I'd like to be president,

2153
01:24:58,140 --> 01:25:00,180
Eh,
I got some time I could do that.

2154
01:25:00,240 --> 01:25:01,620
I'm scared of them.
Yeah.

2155
01:25:01,950 --> 01:25:02,521
Well,
you know what,

2156
01:25:02,521 --> 01:25:03,600
and you're right.
She May,

2157
01:25:04,020 --> 01:25:04,853
but I,
I do think there's going to be so much 

2158
01:25:06,151 --> 01:25:09,060
pressure on her from the party to just 
say,

2159
01:25:09,061 --> 01:25:09,721
no,
you can't.

2160
01:25:09,721 --> 01:25:11,100
I think she's going to look at that and 
go,

2161
01:25:11,250 --> 01:25:12,083
I,
there's no chance I can rally the 

2162
01:25:12,811 --> 01:25:14,820
apparatus around me like I did the last 
time.

2163
01:25:15,210 --> 01:25:16,750
And because of that,
um,

2164
01:25:17,190 --> 01:25:19,350
because even she can't run without the 
machine.

2165
01:25:19,460 --> 01:25:20,041
Right.
I mean,

2166
01:25:20,041 --> 01:25:22,020
that's it.
They've got to figure that out.

2167
01:25:22,021 --> 01:25:22,710
So

2168
01:25:22,710 --> 01:25:23,543
I just wonder if she has so many people 
that owe her favors and she's so deeply 

2169
01:25:28,441 --> 01:25:31,230
entrenched in the world that she could 
somehow,

2170
01:25:31,231 --> 01:25:35,040
or another muster up enough support to 
give it one more shot.

2171
01:25:35,130 --> 01:25:36,250
Yeah.
I mean,

2172
01:25:36,251 --> 01:25:36,650
it's,
it's

2173
01:25:36,650 --> 01:25:37,550
possible.
I mean,

2174
01:25:37,580 --> 01:25:38,413
yeah,
but then you're talking about hurry it 

2175
01:25:40,070 --> 01:25:42,370
all the way to two.
What to to,

2176
01:25:42,380 --> 01:25:43,460
uh,
Kamala Harris,

2177
01:25:43,461 --> 01:25:46,660
cory booker,
Tulsi Gabbert Tulsi Gabbard Tulsi.

2178
01:25:46,660 --> 01:25:51,160
Gabbard Castro is a veteran.
Young makes a lot of sense.

2179
01:25:51,190 --> 01:25:52,810
Very smart,
articulate.

2180
01:25:53,410 --> 01:25:54,243
I think she has a real legitimate chance
of getting people excited about a real 

2181
01:25:57,131 --> 01:25:59,120
future.
Yeah.

2182
01:25:59,150 --> 01:25:59,960
Yeah.
I would not,

2183
01:25:59,960 --> 01:26:01,190
uh,
you know,

2184
01:26:01,470 --> 01:26:03,590
I think it's,
it's time we're close.

2185
01:26:03,591 --> 01:26:05,160
We're getting to that point where we'll,
uh,

2186
01:26:05,270 --> 01:26:06,103
you know,
we end up with a female president and 

2187
01:26:07,700 --> 01:26:08,540
hey,
good for us.

2188
01:26:08,541 --> 01:26:09,650
Right?
I got no problems.

2189
01:26:09,651 --> 01:26:10,610
You know,
there's,

2190
01:26:10,850 --> 01:26:13,220
I think it would actually,
you know,

2191
01:26:13,250 --> 01:26:15,350
I think it would turn the ship in a nice
direction,

2192
01:26:15,351 --> 01:26:16,820
right.
As long as the policies are good,

2193
01:26:16,970 --> 01:26:18,800
I don't care who it is,
as long as we're not,

2194
01:26:18,801 --> 01:26:20,220
you know,
veering off into,

2195
01:26:20,260 --> 01:26:21,770
uh,
you know,

2196
01:26:21,830 --> 01:26:23,640
sort of socialist policy,
you know,

2197
01:26:23,650 --> 01:26:24,483
land and thinking somehow we're going to
all going to end up with a universal 

2198
01:26:26,991 --> 01:26:28,190
basic income.
You know,

2199
01:26:28,530 --> 01:26:30,350
I got a guy coming on and talking about 
that.

2200
01:26:30,351 --> 01:26:31,310
Andrew Yang.
It

2201
01:26:31,490 --> 01:26:34,430
describe universal basic income and what
the benefits would be.

2202
01:26:34,970 --> 01:26:35,803
The reason being that they're worried 
that automation is going to kill a 

2203
01:26:38,631 --> 01:26:43,280
gigantic percent is of jobs in 
manufacturing,

2204
01:26:43,281 --> 01:26:45,020
fast food,
um,

2205
01:26:45,560 --> 01:26:46,393
medical field trucks,
all these different things that 

2206
01:26:50,540 --> 01:26:51,373
universal basic income might actually be
something that we need it certain point 

2207
01:26:55,071 --> 01:26:58,850
in time because so many jobs will go 
away and go away so rapidly.

2208
01:26:58,910 --> 01:27:01,220
Do you think that uh,
kills motivation?

2209
01:27:01,670 --> 01:27:05,390
That's a good question.
What I thought was maybe,

2210
01:27:05,420 --> 01:27:10,070
but maybe if the motivation is not just 
to survive,

2211
01:27:10,250 --> 01:27:12,860
but the motivation to succeed and do 
well,

2212
01:27:13,280 --> 01:27:14,113
it would get people to do what they 
actually want to do for a living or 

2213
01:27:17,211 --> 01:27:19,970
chase down what they actually want to do
and get them motivated to,

2214
01:27:20,170 --> 01:27:23,390
to have a better life,
not just motivated to live,

2215
01:27:23,480 --> 01:27:25,400
follow their passion.
Yes.

2216
01:27:26,110 --> 01:27:26,943
It's,
it's hard because when you give people 

2217
01:27:28,701 --> 01:27:30,320
things for nothing,
right?

2218
01:27:30,350 --> 01:27:33,170
You generally do kill their motivation.
I mean,

2219
01:27:33,230 --> 01:27:36,590
you look neat.
Look no further than trust fund kids.

2220
01:27:37,250 --> 01:27:37,911
Right,
right.

2221
01:27:37,911 --> 01:27:38,511
Yeah.
I guess I,

2222
01:27:38,511 --> 01:27:39,560
that's,
that's a great example.

2223
01:27:39,561 --> 01:27:40,690
Most people would go towards,
you know,

2224
01:27:40,700 --> 01:27:41,533
welfare,
but I think you're right on the other 

2225
01:27:42,711 --> 01:27:44,660
end of the spectrum.
To me,

2226
01:27:44,661 --> 01:27:45,494
trust fund kids.
I've seen this list lists way they 

2227
01:27:49,761 --> 01:27:51,470
approach life,
you know,

2228
01:27:51,471 --> 01:27:52,304
they just laissez faire just,
I just think that it's really hard for 

2229
01:27:58,251 --> 01:28:03,251
people to want something better when 
they have enough.

2230
01:28:04,060 --> 01:28:04,820
They're good.
Yeah.

2231
01:28:04,820 --> 01:28:06,590
Everything's good.
They don't have to do anything.

2232
01:28:06,591 --> 01:28:10,940
And you don't have to motivate yourself 
to do anything to get that money.

2233
01:28:10,940 --> 01:28:11,773
Mani.
Yeah.

2234
01:28:11,780 --> 01:28:12,890
I don't understand the,
the,

2235
01:28:12,891 --> 01:28:13,724
the,
the,

2236
01:28:14,200 --> 01:28:15,950
the logistics behind it,
you know,

2237
01:28:16,010 --> 01:28:17,960
in terms of how it gets paid,
the actual numbers.

2238
01:28:18,480 --> 01:28:19,800
But the,
the part that I,

2239
01:28:19,801 --> 01:28:24,740
that worries me is this issue of,
of motivation and ensuring that then,

2240
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:25,633
you know,
everybody's willing to unmask the sofa 

2241
01:28:27,170 --> 01:28:29,330
and,
and do something productive.

2242
01:28:29,510 --> 01:28:30,321
Right.
And it's not just,

2243
01:28:30,321 --> 01:28:31,154
we can't be like a,
a nation of people following their 

2244
01:28:33,651 --> 01:28:34,484
passion because their passion is,
is completely unpredicted or may make 

2245
01:28:37,590 --> 01:28:39,700
making dream catchers,
pottery loved pottery month.

2246
01:28:39,710 --> 01:28:42,290
Dream catchers too.
I got one in my truck.

2247
01:28:42,630 --> 01:28:44,360
Um,
and really

2248
01:28:48,530 --> 01:28:51,140
what are you doing?
I got a hula girl on the dashboard of my

2249
01:28:51,141 --> 01:28:53,120
truck,
which is getting a new engine,

2250
01:28:53,121 --> 01:28:54,980
by the way.
Even as we speak,

2251
01:28:54,981 --> 01:28:58,280
I had to turn off the wagon here.
It's a grand wagon here.

2252
01:28:58,281 --> 01:29:00,850
The old wood paneled Greg Wagon here.
Yeah.

2253
01:29:00,860 --> 01:29:01,980
The year that they made at

2254
01:29:01,980 --> 01:29:04,410
91 and still drive one of those things.
Yeah,

2255
01:29:04,560 --> 01:29:07,260
absolutely.
It's a great car and uh,

2256
01:29:07,320 --> 01:29:08,153
and but I have to,
I had to rebuild the engine some that 

2257
01:29:10,621 --> 01:29:12,420
works good.
Like a new one

2258
01:29:14,190 --> 01:29:15,023
because this thing is great.
Look that the kids can climb all around 

2259
01:29:18,121 --> 01:29:18,954
it.
I can drive to the drive in theater and 

2260
01:29:20,520 --> 01:29:21,830
they can,
they put a back

2261
01:29:23,980 --> 01:29:27,900
the hatchback and they'd just sit there 
and I do live in the 50s actually.

2262
01:29:27,920 --> 01:29:28,990
Yeah.
Yeah.

2263
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:33,000
That with the little clip on speaker 
that can bend.

2264
01:29:33,320 --> 01:29:36,000
It is fantastic.
You have not a long time.

2265
01:29:36,010 --> 01:29:38,340
Is that what you have?
I got the blue.

2266
01:29:38,400 --> 01:29:39,233
It's blue with a sand interior fucking 
wizard that decided to go with those 

2267
01:29:43,831 --> 01:29:45,870
wood panels on the side.
It's fantastic.

2268
01:29:45,871 --> 01:29:46,704
And then how did that,
how did everybody wake up and decide 

2269
01:29:48,571 --> 01:29:50,610
that that sucks?
Yeah.

2270
01:29:51,100 --> 01:29:53,130
I have a while.
I tell you something.

2271
01:29:53,131 --> 01:29:54,540
It's a great suit,
great vehicle.

2272
01:29:54,840 --> 01:29:55,673
And it's also,
nobody gets anywhere near me cause that 

2273
01:29:58,141 --> 01:30:01,460
fucker is made of of all steel.
Yeah,

2274
01:30:01,500 --> 01:30:02,333
they're heavy.
And that son of a bitch will plow 

2275
01:30:04,081 --> 01:30:04,914
through anything,
but it's just a great car and the dog 

2276
01:30:07,381 --> 01:30:08,214
loves it.
And I can fit all the gloves and the 

2277
01:30:10,590 --> 01:30:11,450
fishing.
Yeah,

2278
01:30:11,930 --> 01:30:13,920
you put the fishing poles in there.
It's all good.

2279
01:30:17,580 --> 01:30:19,060
No,
you're kidding.

2280
01:30:19,590 --> 01:30:20,730
No,
I'm lucky if I,

2281
01:30:20,880 --> 01:30:25,030
if I have breaks,
but don't you want to call with brakes?

2282
01:30:25,260 --> 01:30:26,420
Eh,
Eh,

2283
01:30:27,480 --> 01:30:31,440
it's big enough when you work in 
security for too long,

2284
01:30:31,441 --> 01:30:33,540
you're like,
there's no security now.

2285
01:30:33,541 --> 01:30:36,570
Fuck Outta here.
Just nice seat belt doesn't work.

2286
01:30:38,460 --> 01:30:41,730
But I've been meaning to fix it.
You have a seatbelt.

2287
01:30:42,210 --> 01:30:45,030
The receiver is broken and we're clicks 
in.

2288
01:30:45,031 --> 01:30:45,631
Yeah,
exactly.

2289
01:30:45,631 --> 01:30:48,030
And I've been meaning to get that fixed 
cars and being,

2290
01:30:48,031 --> 01:30:50,220
when you don't have your seat belt on 
and like good luck.

2291
01:30:50,340 --> 01:30:51,380
No,
it doesn't talk to me at all.

2292
01:30:51,840 --> 01:30:55,080
And you know what else?
Nobody can track me in that car that,

2293
01:30:55,140 --> 01:30:58,020
you know what attracted me and that son 
of a bitch.

2294
01:30:58,021 --> 01:31:00,180
So you just leave your phone at home and
you're fucking,

2295
01:31:00,181 --> 01:31:01,680
you're good.
I'm good man.

2296
01:31:01,681 --> 01:31:05,040
I'm all pick red boner.
I met a burner.

2297
01:31:05,770 --> 01:31:08,030
Hello phone.

2298
01:31:08,670 --> 01:31:09,503
I can fit my boner in there too,
which is Kinda just burner phones come 

2299
01:31:12,211 --> 01:31:15,400
with boners
Trenton,

2300
01:31:15,430 --> 01:31:18,690
a burner phone barter.
You got a boner and then,

2301
01:31:18,780 --> 01:31:20,210
yeah.
Yeah.

2302
01:31:20,430 --> 01:31:21,600
It's,
it's a great,

2303
01:31:21,630 --> 01:31:23,100
it's a great vehicle.
Like I said,

2304
01:31:23,170 --> 01:31:24,003
my kids love it.
Mugsy and scooter and Sluggo juicing 

2305
01:31:26,920 --> 01:31:29,100
that you got it because you can't track 
you with it.

2306
01:31:29,101 --> 01:31:31,170
And also they can't.
Let me ask you this.

2307
01:31:31,220 --> 01:31:34,410
This is a tough one.
I want to ask you to conspiracy one's,

2308
01:31:34,411 --> 01:31:37,140
but this one's a tough one.
Michael Hastings,

2309
01:31:37,220 --> 01:31:38,840
you know his case.
Do you know story?

2310
01:31:38,870 --> 01:31:39,703
Yeah.
Yeah.

2311
01:31:39,990 --> 01:31:41,120
What do you think happened there?
Well,

2312
01:31:41,160 --> 01:31:42,510
let's,
let's explain what happened.

2313
01:31:42,990 --> 01:31:44,340
What,
who he was,

2314
01:31:44,370 --> 01:31:47,220
he was a journalist.
He was embedded in,

2315
01:31:47,500 --> 01:31:51,660
was it in Iraq during the,
during the war.

2316
01:31:51,780 --> 01:31:55,740
He was writing a story for the role for 
rolling stone.

2317
01:31:56,070 --> 01:31:58,320
And he was writing about which general 
was it?

2318
01:32:02,200 --> 01:32:03,190
Crystal.
Crystal,

2319
01:32:03,540 --> 01:32:04,800
crystal and stay on the crystal.
Yeah.

2320
01:32:04,810 --> 01:32:08,680
So he wrote this story and apparently 
while this happened,

2321
01:32:08,681 --> 01:32:11,590
the Iceland volcano went off.
So they,

2322
01:32:11,670 --> 01:32:15,040
they suspended air travel.
So he was stuck there far longer than he

2323
01:32:15,041 --> 01:32:19,540
was supposed to be and people got 
comfortable with this guy being around.

2324
01:32:19,541 --> 01:32:22,240
Right.
And so they behave the way they behave.

2325
01:32:22,241 --> 01:32:23,074
They made some jokes about things.
He apparently made some jokes about 

2326
01:32:26,231 --> 01:32:29,770
Obama.
This guy put this,

2327
01:32:29,800 --> 01:32:32,380
Michael Hastings put all this stuff and 
rolling stone.

2328
01:32:32,450 --> 01:32:35,500
Um,
it wound up being a huge scandal.

2329
01:32:36,220 --> 01:32:37,053
Mcchrystal had to step down and there 
was a lot of people that hated that guy 

2330
01:32:42,340 --> 01:32:47,340
and a lot of people loved mcchrystal and
he was a highly respected general.

2331
01:32:48,010 --> 01:32:48,940
Yeah,
absolutely.

2332
01:32:48,970 --> 01:32:53,110
He had a step down from his position and
next thing you know,

2333
01:32:53,680 --> 01:32:54,513
x amount of time later,
this guy drives his car 150 miles an 

2334
01:32:59,201 --> 01:33:00,310
hour into a tree.

2335
01:33:00,850 --> 01:33:03,280
It blows up.
The engine goes flying the whole deal.

2336
01:33:03,690 --> 01:33:07,570
Uh,
the conspiracy theory was that there was

2337
01:33:07,571 --> 01:33:09,040
a way,
cause he had a brand new Mercedes,

2338
01:33:09,220 --> 01:33:14,220
there was a way that they could take 
over the controls of your vehicle,

2339
01:33:15,011 --> 01:33:17,530
the acceleration,
the braking steering,

2340
01:33:17,710 --> 01:33:21,130
and they could do all this remotely.
If they put something in your car,

2341
01:33:21,131 --> 01:33:21,964
like we were talking about,
if you could get ahold of this 

2342
01:33:23,411 --> 01:33:24,244
television,
you could turn that television to a 

2343
01:33:25,601 --> 01:33:26,434
receiver.
Right.

2344
01:33:26,680 --> 01:33:27,513
Do you think that is possible that 
someone could have gotten a hold of his 

2345
01:33:30,881 --> 01:33:33,820
car and made him suicide himself?

2346
01:33:34,580 --> 01:33:36,460
Uh,
two parts to it.

2347
01:33:36,480 --> 01:33:37,930
Uh,
one is,

2348
01:33:37,931 --> 01:33:39,940
is it possible that you can take control
of a vehicle,

2349
01:33:40,030 --> 01:33:41,530
a modern vehicle?
Yes.

2350
01:33:41,650 --> 01:33:42,770
Not,
not that,

2351
01:33:42,910 --> 01:33:44,130
not that,
not the woody,

2352
01:33:44,230 --> 01:33:44,981
not the woody.
Yes,

2353
01:33:44,981 --> 01:33:46,480
we call it.
Um,

2354
01:33:46,510 --> 01:33:47,343
but,
uh,

2355
01:33:47,710 --> 01:33:48,521
uh,
so yes,

2356
01:33:48,521 --> 01:33:49,354
it's absolutely possible that you can 
take those is no two ways about 

2357
01:33:51,611 --> 01:33:53,320
acceleration,
steering everything.

2358
01:33:53,670 --> 01:33:54,820
Yeah.
If you've got,

2359
01:33:55,070 --> 01:33:55,903
and,
and,

2360
01:33:55,990 --> 01:33:57,220
um,
and I mean,

2361
01:33:57,221 --> 01:33:58,900
think about people should think about 
it.

2362
01:33:58,901 --> 01:33:59,734
They think about the,
the Onstar or think about the ability 

2363
01:34:01,451 --> 01:34:04,370
for your car to send data,
uh,

2364
01:34:04,750 --> 01:34:07,000
to the,
to the vehicle manufacturer.

2365
01:34:07,020 --> 01:34:07,540
Right?
Right.

2366
01:34:07,540 --> 01:34:08,840
To tell them,
you know,

2367
01:34:08,890 --> 01:34:11,200
what's going on with your vehicle.
Um,

2368
01:34:11,740 --> 01:34:13,690
that's a,
that's a handshake operation,

2369
01:34:13,691 --> 01:34:14,680
right?
Once you do that,

2370
01:34:14,700 --> 01:34:16,840
that that means there's an exchange of 
information.

2371
01:34:16,841 --> 01:34:17,501
What does that mean?
Well,

2372
01:34:17,501 --> 01:34:19,990
that means you can access,
can you access that information?

2373
01:34:19,991 --> 01:34:20,860
Sure,
of course you can.

2374
01:34:21,040 --> 01:34:23,320
Does that mean you can then take 
physical controls short?

2375
01:34:23,321 --> 01:34:24,610
That's it's,
it's an,

2376
01:34:24,640 --> 01:34:28,030
it's just another iteration of the 
exchange of information,

2377
01:34:28,060 --> 01:34:28,893
right?
Software can take control of physical 

2378
01:34:32,080 --> 01:34:33,730
systems so that,
yeah.

2379
01:34:33,970 --> 01:34:34,803
So the first part is yes.
Is it possible that that car could have 

2380
01:34:37,450 --> 01:34:39,230
been taken over shore?
Uh,

2381
01:34:39,280 --> 01:34:41,320
do I think that's what happened?
I have no idea.

2382
01:34:41,440 --> 01:34:43,050
I really don't.
But,

2383
01:34:43,080 --> 01:34:44,650
um,
it's,

2384
01:34:44,651 --> 01:34:46,630
it's,
it's certainly a possibility.

2385
01:34:46,840 --> 01:34:48,430
I mean,
when I hear people talk about,

2386
01:34:48,460 --> 01:34:49,780
you know,
certain conspiracy theories,

2387
01:34:49,990 --> 01:34:50,823
I looked at it and go,
there's just no fucking way that can 

2388
01:34:52,061 --> 01:34:53,290
happen.
Like what one,

2389
01:34:53,330 --> 01:34:55,560
one d say no fucking one.
Uh,

2390
01:34:56,680 --> 01:34:58,130
actually I have a hard

2391
01:34:58,130 --> 01:34:59,400
time thinking of one.
Um,

2392
01:35:00,300 --> 01:35:01,400
uh,
I liked it,

2393
01:35:01,401 --> 01:35:03,500
the theory that with every burner phone 
you get a boner.

2394
01:35:03,590 --> 01:35:04,580
That's,
I just,

2395
01:35:04,850 --> 01:35:08,650
I can't imagine that could happen.
But it sounds good.

2396
01:35:09,830 --> 01:35:11,390
I think I'm good.
Misunderstood.

2397
01:35:11,480 --> 01:35:12,313
What I'm saying is you get the burner 
phone because you have a boner already 

2398
01:35:16,410 --> 01:35:17,610
trying to get rid of it.
Oh,

2399
01:35:17,620 --> 01:35:19,590
I didn't see the owner.
Yeah,

2400
01:35:20,030 --> 01:35:20,863
I got the priorities.
So until you secretary to get a burner 

2401
01:35:24,921 --> 01:35:29,921
phone to meet her at the old
hotel,

2402
01:35:30,411 --> 01:35:31,700
how the,
Oh man.

2403
01:35:31,701 --> 01:35:36,350
Just like Jeff Bezos and he's $70 
billion down the down the toilet.

2404
01:35:36,380 --> 01:35:37,390
Oh yeah.
That's,

2405
01:35:37,580 --> 01:35:41,740
how did they get his text messages?
That's a good fucking cybersecurity.

2406
01:35:41,920 --> 01:35:42,753
Yeah.
They got his text messages to his 

2407
01:35:44,931 --> 01:35:46,610
mistress.
Yeah.

2408
01:35:46,730 --> 01:35:47,780
Who knows how that happened.
So it,

2409
01:35:47,781 --> 01:35:50,330
unless maybe she maybe meaning Mrs 
Bayzos,

2410
01:35:50,570 --> 01:35:52,050
maybe she hired a,
uh,

2411
01:35:52,100 --> 01:35:52,933
you know,
some dodgy investigator to come up with 

2412
01:35:55,100 --> 01:35:55,933
that.

2413
01:35:56,320 --> 01:35:57,830
Well,
I noticed that it was an iphone.

2414
01:35:58,070 --> 01:35:58,903
No visit an iphone.
And he had an I pad and she had the 

2415
01:36:01,701 --> 01:36:04,670
password to the IPAD.
She could get all those messages.

2416
01:36:04,671 --> 01:36:05,504
Yeah.
Yeah.

2417
01:36:06,460 --> 01:36:07,800
But it's a,
that,

2418
01:36:07,801 --> 01:36:09,110
what do they live?
They live in Washington,

2419
01:36:09,111 --> 01:36:09,980
right?
State of Washington.

2420
01:36:10,010 --> 01:36:10,830
Yeah.
Okay.

2421
01:36:10,830 --> 01:36:13,370
All right.
So I guess that's communal,

2422
01:36:13,700 --> 01:36:14,850
I think.
Yeah.

2423
01:36:14,851 --> 01:36:15,740
She,
well,

2424
01:36:15,741 --> 01:36:17,780
they started the company together.
She helped him.

2425
01:36:18,030 --> 01:36:19,250
Yeah.
So that's a wrap.

2426
01:36:20,150 --> 01:36:21,890
But you know,
whatever,

2427
01:36:22,400 --> 01:36:23,870
70 billion.
Yeah.

2428
01:36:23,900 --> 01:36:28,040
It's rough to give away 70 billion.
But let's be completely honest.

2429
01:36:28,310 --> 01:36:29,143
If you're,
if you have $70 billion and you notice 

2430
01:36:32,030 --> 01:36:34,670
whether you have 70 or a hundred.
Yeah,

2431
01:36:34,760 --> 01:36:35,420
yeah.
All kind of,

2432
01:36:35,420 --> 01:36:39,110
you might be an asshole.
You know the difference?

2433
01:36:39,140 --> 01:36:40,960
Yeah.
How the fuck do you even feel it?

2434
01:36:40,990 --> 01:36:41,823
If she takes 70 billion?
This is lifestyle change cause you have 

2435
01:36:44,061 --> 01:36:45,290
to get rid of one of his jets.

2436
01:36:45,860 --> 01:36:48,050
Like what happened?
He's got to give up cable.

2437
01:36:48,080 --> 01:36:51,380
Does he have a bionic smaller ring for 
his mistress?

2438
01:36:52,210 --> 01:36:54,380
But she's not even a is apparently they 
were separated.

2439
01:36:54,381 --> 01:36:56,260
We're not going to get his girlfriend.
Oh Geez.

2440
01:36:56,270 --> 01:36:57,103
Really?
Yeah.

2441
01:36:57,920 --> 01:36:59,720
Okay.
So they're saying he was cheating on his

2442
01:36:59,721 --> 01:37:00,554
wife,
but he wasn't really because they were 

2443
01:37:01,580 --> 01:37:02,830
separated.
Yeah.

2444
01:37:02,950 --> 01:37:05,630
You would think that that's fair game,
but I'm sure that it's anyway,

2445
01:37:05,690 --> 01:37:07,610
it's going to be costly.
She's so hot.

2446
01:37:08,360 --> 01:37:09,280
Oh,
she's so cool.

2447
01:37:09,290 --> 01:37:11,060
Mrs Bayzos or one?
The new one.

2448
01:37:11,090 --> 01:37:11,923
Oh.
Oh,

2449
01:37:11,930 --> 01:37:13,870
I think they're friends.
I think she and Mrs Bayzos.

2450
01:37:13,880 --> 01:37:15,380
We're friends.
They're friends.

2451
01:37:15,381 --> 01:37:17,390
Yeah.
It's all going to be very amicable.

2452
01:37:17,660 --> 01:37:19,720
They fucking circle.
They know what they're doing.

2453
01:37:20,210 --> 01:37:22,260
Coyotes,
man doing,

2454
01:37:22,400 --> 01:37:24,530
they just take their time,
their patient wolves.

2455
01:37:25,640 --> 01:37:27,180
I think he's,
I think it's,

2456
01:37:27,190 --> 01:37:29,990
it's interesting because I think he,
um,

2457
01:37:30,590 --> 01:37:33,440
he's changed if you look at Bayzos over 
the years,

2458
01:37:33,441 --> 01:37:33,830
right?

2459
01:37:33,830 --> 01:37:34,663
Yeah.
And you look at the way he is now just 

2460
01:37:36,471 --> 01:37:38,240
as physical appearance.
You can just,

2461
01:37:38,241 --> 01:37:40,430
you can just tell that that money,
yeah.

2462
01:37:40,460 --> 01:37:42,160
Money probably hired a personal trainer 
too,

2463
01:37:42,420 --> 01:37:44,260
but he's got the money,
but he's gonna probably have to let them

2464
01:37:44,261 --> 01:37:46,820
go now.
Can't afford that shit anymore.

2465
01:37:47,060 --> 01:37:48,970
I lost 70 billion.
Well,

2466
01:37:48,980 --> 01:37:52,070
the smart thing would honestly be to,
for him to give away half.

2467
01:37:52,071 --> 01:37:54,610
Don't even duke it out with lawyers.
I don't take too long.

2468
01:37:54,680 --> 01:37:56,460
But he,
no prenup agreement.

2469
01:37:56,550 --> 01:37:57,383
There's no prenuptial Koala.
It's understood that Ms. Sanchez has 

2470
01:38:00,241 --> 01:38:01,074
sent text messages to a friend showing 
off for a new relationship with the 

2471
01:38:03,451 --> 01:38:06,390
billionaire and the friends sent them to
the inquirer.

2472
01:38:06,391 --> 01:38:11,391
Water con you fucking dumb ass.
Oh Damn.

2473
01:38:13,170 --> 01:38:14,940
She's hot though.
She looks like that actress.

2474
01:38:14,941 --> 01:38:16,190
I can't remember her name.
Yeah,

2475
01:38:16,200 --> 01:38:18,730
the one on modern family.
Yes.

2476
01:38:19,760 --> 01:38:21,480
Yeah,
I could see what she sees at him.

2477
01:38:21,540 --> 01:38:22,530
He's like,
yeah,

2478
01:38:22,531 --> 01:38:23,364
he's,
he's uh,

2479
01:38:23,570 --> 01:38:24,403
you know,
it's the thin neck in relationship with 

2480
01:38:26,731 --> 01:38:28,860
the large head chicks.
Love that.

2481
01:38:28,950 --> 01:38:29,770
Jeff,
you're still,

2482
01:38:29,770 --> 01:38:31,550
he loved that look.
Yes.

2483
01:38:31,551 --> 01:38:34,200
Such a man.
And he sent her like naked selfies too.

2484
01:38:34,290 --> 01:38:35,011
Ah,
no,

2485
01:38:35,011 --> 01:38:35,844
not him too.

2486
01:38:37,910 --> 01:38:39,750
I think you did.
What is that?

2487
01:38:39,751 --> 01:38:40,584
You don't,
why did dudes think that women want to 

2488
01:38:42,001 --> 01:38:42,990
look at their junk?
Right?

2489
01:38:43,050 --> 01:38:43,890
I mean,
I know.

2490
01:38:43,950 --> 01:38:46,830
I just don't,
I don't get that part of it.

2491
01:38:47,100 --> 01:38:47,933
I don't get what makes you think unless 
you really been drinking that you're 

2492
01:38:50,281 --> 01:38:51,114
going to go,
you know what?

2493
01:38:51,150 --> 01:38:53,680
I'll bet she really wants to see my,
my balls.

2494
01:38:53,980 --> 01:38:57,150
Girls do.
Some girls are crazy good ones.

2495
01:38:57,151 --> 01:38:59,540
Damn.
She's hot buttons.

2496
01:39:00,110 --> 01:39:03,430
Warren Sanchez has been the romantic 
relationship with jet blue.

2497
01:39:03,450 --> 01:39:06,900
She's hot since April,
2018 or Sunday long.

2498
01:39:06,901 --> 01:39:09,960
So it's a long term thing.
June,

2499
01:39:09,960 --> 01:39:10,620
July.
That's enough.

2500
01:39:10,620 --> 01:39:13,200
He's probably shot so many loads.
Wow.

2501
01:39:13,230 --> 01:39:14,640
He's in love now.
Yeah.

2502
01:39:14,730 --> 01:39:15,563
Amazing.
Do a Donald Trump had something to say 

2503
01:39:16,591 --> 01:39:18,750
about it.
What do you say?

2504
01:39:19,230 --> 01:39:20,063
So sorry to hear the news about Jeff 
Bozos being taken down by a competitor 

2505
01:39:23,700 --> 01:39:24,533
who's reporting I understand is far more
accurate than the reporting in his 

2506
01:39:28,861 --> 01:39:31,800
lobbyist newspaper,
the Amazon Washington Post.

2507
01:39:32,100 --> 01:39:34,620
Hopefully the paypal soon be placed in a
better,

2508
01:39:34,650 --> 01:39:36,420
more responsible hands.
Yeah,

2509
01:39:36,430 --> 01:39:38,940
he wants,
he watched it off.

2510
01:39:39,180 --> 01:39:40,013
He wants her to get it.
He wants Bayzos to not have the 

2511
01:39:42,121 --> 01:39:44,450
Washington Post,
which is highly critical.

2512
01:39:44,470 --> 01:39:45,303
The president,
while the inquirer has been known to 

2513
01:39:46,801 --> 01:39:47,940
kill stores,
critical,

2514
01:39:47,941 --> 01:39:48,930
the president.
Oh,

2515
01:39:48,931 --> 01:39:51,780
so the enquirer got ahold of the story.
I get it,

2516
01:39:51,990 --> 01:39:56,640
but you know it was,
I'll bet Jeff Bezos in president's mind.

2517
01:39:56,910 --> 01:40:01,260
I'll bet is his opinion went up when he 
saw that picture of Sanchez probably.

2518
01:40:01,410 --> 01:40:02,243
I'll bet he was like,
but then you probably read the text 

2519
01:40:03,631 --> 01:40:04,540
messages and like,
ah,

2520
01:40:04,650 --> 01:40:06,280
amateur,
come on.

2521
01:40:06,330 --> 01:40:07,870
Come on.
What are you telling her that uh,

2522
01:40:08,290 --> 01:40:09,210
what,
what are you going to do?

2523
01:40:09,211 --> 01:40:11,460
Jump right out of the frying pan.
Get right back into the fire.

2524
01:40:11,820 --> 01:40:12,653
How about you go to fucking Ibiza and 
dance on the couch with a hundred of 

2525
01:40:16,321 --> 01:40:17,154
those broads?

2526
01:40:17,610 --> 01:40:19,290
Take a little time off is what you're 
saying.

2527
01:40:19,350 --> 01:40:21,480
Jeff needs a,
it needs a coach.

2528
01:40:21,660 --> 01:40:22,493
Isn't that interesting how dude's do I 
think by wealthy dude seem to do that 

2529
01:40:25,231 --> 01:40:26,064
more than others.
They seem to go straight from one 

2530
01:40:27,511 --> 01:40:29,580
relationship immediately into another 
one.

2531
01:40:29,940 --> 01:40:33,360
Whereas I think that the average dude I 
think is doing what you're thinking,

2532
01:40:33,361 --> 01:40:34,081
which is like,
yeah,

2533
01:40:34,081 --> 01:40:37,290
I'm gonna take some time down.
Well the average dude also isn't running

2534
01:40:37,291 --> 01:40:40,500
a gigantic multinational corporation 
like Amazon.

2535
01:40:40,710 --> 01:40:41,543
The thing about that is the amount of 
time that that guy has to dedicate to 

2536
01:40:44,551 --> 01:40:48,720
his job,
it's gotta be just unfathomable.

2537
01:40:48,870 --> 01:40:50,790
I mean,
I can't imagine what,

2538
01:40:51,180 --> 01:40:52,013
what is involved and that guy's day to 
day activity and he seems ruthless as 

2539
01:40:55,151 --> 01:40:58,510
fuck and very hands on.
So how did,

2540
01:40:58,530 --> 01:40:59,363
he probably doesn't have time to go to a
visa if the average guy had anywhere 

2541
01:41:02,621 --> 01:41:04,570
close to a hundred billion dollars 
though.

2542
01:41:04,900 --> 01:41:05,870
Oh,
they just bail.

2543
01:41:06,790 --> 01:41:10,450
Should everyday be strip clubs cash out 
to yeah,

2544
01:41:10,460 --> 01:41:12,530
no more showing up at the office.
Cash out.

2545
01:41:13,030 --> 01:41:15,520
Cash me out and keep going.
Catch me now

2546
01:41:17,080 --> 01:41:19,040
I do podcasts.
I keep showing it.

2547
01:41:19,041 --> 01:41:22,300
I wouldn't have any ads,
no ads,

2548
01:41:22,890 --> 01:41:23,750
and be like,
ah,

2549
01:41:23,830 --> 01:41:25,110
I'm good.
That'd be nice.

2550
01:41:25,111 --> 01:41:26,650
I'm going to give you guys this shift 
for free.

2551
01:41:27,220 --> 01:41:30,610
I looked at the overheads expensive.
I need I just fucking building.

2552
01:41:30,611 --> 01:41:32,660
And it's an amazing building,
by the way,

2553
01:41:32,661 --> 01:41:33,370
Internet.
Thank you.

2554
01:41:33,370 --> 01:41:34,151
Have you ever showed it?
I mean,

2555
01:41:34,151 --> 01:41:37,510
if you'd like displayed it right at the 
gym you've got is fantastic.

2556
01:41:37,520 --> 01:41:40,000
Yeah.
I so put some pictures of it up,

2557
01:41:40,001 --> 01:41:40,900
but yeah.
You know what,

2558
01:41:40,901 --> 01:41:41,734
man?
For me it's important because I'm not 

2559
01:41:43,781 --> 01:41:46,660
busy like Jeff Bezos,
but I'm fucking busy.

2560
01:41:46,720 --> 01:41:49,300
I need to get all my shit done in one 
spot,

2561
01:41:49,301 --> 01:41:50,920
so on when I can.

2562
01:41:50,950 --> 01:41:53,860
I come here early,
banging out a workout in the morning.

2563
01:41:54,190 --> 01:41:58,710
I get my fucking sauna in float float in
a sauna here.

2564
01:41:58,760 --> 01:42:01,060
I didn't know.
I didn't know the a tank.

2565
01:42:01,061 --> 01:42:01,770
Yeah.
Yeah.

2566
01:42:01,770 --> 01:42:03,330
I've got a sauna.
It's,

2567
01:42:03,350 --> 01:42:04,600
it's for me,
it's nice.

2568
01:42:04,630 --> 01:42:05,463
I can get everything done in one spot.
It actually saves me money just because 

2569
01:42:08,081 --> 01:42:10,130
the amount of time that I have now.
I,

2570
01:42:10,220 --> 01:42:11,170
by the way,
uh,

2571
01:42:11,171 --> 01:42:12,004
I did not say it at the outset,
but I should say that show you didn't 

2572
01:42:14,201 --> 01:42:15,430
Boise,
Boise,

2573
01:42:15,520 --> 01:42:16,840
Idaho.
It's a beautiful place.

2574
01:42:17,110 --> 01:42:19,030
Uh,
telling me that was fucking brilliant.

2575
01:42:19,060 --> 01:42:20,350
Thank you.
That's show was fantastic.

2576
01:42:20,351 --> 01:42:22,720
Fun.
People were talking about that for a lot

2577
01:42:22,721 --> 01:42:24,310
of long time afterwards.
It was,

2578
01:42:24,311 --> 01:42:26,830
and it was a great crowd.
Does a giant ass place.

2579
01:42:27,510 --> 01:42:28,343
Yeah,
it was fun.

2580
01:42:28,350 --> 01:42:29,580
It was really good time.
I mean,

2581
01:42:29,581 --> 01:42:31,240
is it for people listening?
It was a massive,

2582
01:42:31,300 --> 01:42:34,300
it's a Taco bell arena,
which is the best venue in,

2583
01:42:34,301 --> 01:42:35,080
in,
in the city.

2584
01:42:35,080 --> 01:42:39,940
It's a big venue and there was lines 
just blocks and blocks and blocks before

2585
01:42:39,941 --> 01:42:40,774
they opened the doors and even after 
they opened doors because there was so 

2586
01:42:41,951 --> 01:42:44,560
many people.
Boise is a great town,

2587
01:42:44,561 --> 01:42:45,394
man.
I was,

2588
01:42:45,550 --> 01:42:46,383
I had heard how good it was.
That was my first time ever go in there 

2589
01:42:48,551 --> 01:42:51,460
and I was blown away.
The people were super friendly.

2590
01:42:51,461 --> 01:42:54,010
It's gorgeous there.
Everything is clean.

2591
01:42:54,340 --> 01:42:56,320
I don't want to talk about it.
I don't want anybody to move in.

2592
01:42:56,580 --> 01:42:58,540
People are moving in.
I think I we talked about that.

2593
01:42:58,541 --> 01:42:59,620
Yeah.
Before the show started,

2594
01:42:59,621 --> 01:43:01,940
was it Wall Street Journal wrote an 
article saying it's,

2595
01:43:01,950 --> 01:43:02,783
it is sometime ago,
a couple of months ago or whenever it's 

2596
01:43:04,510 --> 01:43:07,060
saying it's fastest growing city in the,
in the country.

2597
01:43:07,090 --> 01:43:08,140
Once you go,
there you go.

2598
01:43:08,141 --> 01:43:08,974
Okay.
Like if you brought your wife there and 

2599
01:43:10,691 --> 01:43:11,171
he said,
look,

2600
01:43:11,171 --> 01:43:12,160
this is what we're going to move here.

2601
01:43:12,280 --> 01:43:13,113
She was like,
we got a lot of people from California 

2602
01:43:15,461 --> 01:43:16,720
coming up there.
Of course say that much.

2603
01:43:16,721 --> 01:43:17,554
Yeah.
And some good friends of mine who is 

2604
01:43:18,370 --> 01:43:20,440
living down on the beach right now,
uh,

2605
01:43:20,680 --> 01:43:22,750
they,
they seriously looking at it.

2606
01:43:22,751 --> 01:43:25,260
They've been looking at property and 
think you maybe wolves,

2607
01:43:25,890 --> 01:43:28,090
uh,
with coyotes and the wolves.

2608
01:43:28,140 --> 01:43:28,973
No,
well,

2609
01:43:28,980 --> 01:43:29,890
no,
we haven't seen them.

2610
01:43:29,891 --> 01:43:30,760
We got them,
but we haven't seen.

2611
01:43:31,130 --> 01:43:31,963
But we've got,
we had a coyote in our neighborhood for 

2612
01:43:33,341 --> 01:43:35,740
quite awhile.
He kind of became famous and they're,

2613
01:43:35,890 --> 01:43:37,120
they're good looking coyotes.
You know,

2614
01:43:37,180 --> 01:43:38,050
east coast,
they're,

2615
01:43:38,051 --> 01:43:38,561
yeah,
they're,

2616
01:43:38,561 --> 01:43:40,900
they're like skinny and frail.
They looked like Wiley Coyote.

2617
01:43:41,140 --> 01:43:43,530
But out here,
out west a up there,

2618
01:43:43,900 --> 01:43:44,980
they're well fed.
Well,

2619
01:43:44,981 --> 01:43:46,540
you have so much wildlife.
Yeah.

2620
01:43:46,690 --> 01:43:47,201
Yeah.
You know,

2621
01:43:47,201 --> 01:43:49,780
Idaho has an incredible mule deer 
population.

2622
01:43:49,781 --> 01:43:52,070
Do you have amazing El Population?
Elk Hunting

2623
01:43:52,080 --> 01:43:52,980
is,
yeah.

2624
01:43:53,110 --> 01:43:53,960
Oh,
it's beautiful.

2625
01:43:54,300 --> 01:43:56,630
Yeah.
Decided to go off the grid.

2626
01:43:56,631 --> 01:43:59,720
That's one of my prime spots.
Not telling nobody.

2627
01:43:59,721 --> 01:44:02,180
I'll tell you.
Let me know.

2628
01:44:02,210 --> 01:44:05,360
I'm going to pave the way,
man.

2629
01:44:05,361 --> 01:44:06,111
It's so,
it's,

2630
01:44:06,111 --> 01:44:06,560
yeah,
it's,

2631
01:44:06,560 --> 01:44:08,040
it's a good spot.
Um,

2632
01:44:08,210 --> 01:44:09,360
and uh,
and I,

2633
01:44:09,361 --> 01:44:10,194
I got to stop talking about it too,
because I get a lot of shit for saying 

2634
01:44:13,311 --> 01:44:14,370
nice things about it,
but I can't,

2635
01:44:14,371 --> 01:44:15,770
I can't help it.
It's a zero sum.

2636
01:44:15,771 --> 01:44:18,050
Yeah.
Unheralded spots in this country.

2637
01:44:18,051 --> 01:44:19,880
And I think that's most certainly one of
them.

2638
01:44:19,881 --> 01:44:20,481
Yeah.
There's a,

2639
01:44:20,481 --> 01:44:22,370
there's a gang of other ones too though,
you know,

2640
01:44:22,371 --> 01:44:25,070
and it's,
it's really the west in the west,

2641
01:44:25,071 --> 01:44:25,904
like the,
these areas that just don't have the 

2642
01:44:27,801 --> 01:44:30,710
gigantic populations but have everything
else.

2643
01:44:30,740 --> 01:44:34,520
Gorgeous scenery and the mountain air 
and just God damn.

2644
01:44:34,570 --> 01:44:35,403
Yeah.
The fishing is,

2645
01:44:35,420 --> 01:44:36,253
that's the other thing.

2646
01:44:36,640 --> 01:44:37,620
Oh my God.
I'm sure.

2647
01:44:37,640 --> 01:44:39,480
Fly Fishing and my oldest boy,
uh,

2648
01:44:39,590 --> 01:44:44,180
scooters is a really gotten into fly 
fishing and he's got a great mindset for

2649
01:44:44,181 --> 01:44:44,511
it.
Right.

2650
01:44:44,511 --> 01:44:45,051
You know,
he just,

2651
01:44:45,051 --> 01:44:46,070
he's,
he's one of those guys,

2652
01:44:46,071 --> 01:44:46,904
he could be out there for a few hours,
not catch anything and still have a 

2653
01:44:48,831 --> 01:44:51,260
great time.
And really you've got other kids,

2654
01:44:51,261 --> 01:44:52,460
like my,
my two younger kids,

2655
01:44:52,700 --> 01:44:53,271
you know,
they just,

2656
01:44:53,271 --> 01:44:54,510
they want a dynamite fish.
Right.

2657
01:44:54,511 --> 01:44:55,344
Right.
They just want to get the fucking fish 

2658
01:44:56,241 --> 01:44:58,490
and get on with it.
And so they don't,

2659
01:44:58,491 --> 01:45:00,020
they're not going to fly fish at anytime
soon,

2660
01:45:00,021 --> 01:45:02,270
but scooters all about it.
And uh,

2661
01:45:02,630 --> 01:45:03,650
yeah,
not to,

2662
01:45:03,651 --> 01:45:05,360
uh,
not to bang on about that,

2663
01:45:05,380 --> 01:45:06,213
but basically all the wildlife 
activities or all the outdoor 

2664
01:45:08,841 --> 01:45:10,150
activities.
Yeah.

2665
01:45:10,160 --> 01:45:13,610
We got more river frontage,
more river mileage than any state except

2666
01:45:13,611 --> 01:45:14,870
for Alaska.
Really?

2667
01:45:14,900 --> 01:45:15,733
Yeah.
Uh,

2668
01:45:15,740 --> 01:45:17,930
we got more and the,
and so the Whitewater is fantastic.

2669
01:45:18,440 --> 01:45:19,273
It's great rafting up there.
The climbing's fantastic mountain 

2670
01:45:21,561 --> 01:45:22,394
biking.
I mean,

2671
01:45:22,400 --> 01:45:23,233
we'd jump on our bikes,
we can be up in the foothills in 

2672
01:45:26,180 --> 01:45:30,050
literally about seven minutes and then 
spend the afternoon and not see anybody.

2673
01:45:30,620 --> 01:45:31,341
I mean,
it's crazy.

2674
01:45:31,341 --> 01:45:33,350
And we live right in the center of town 
basically.

2675
01:45:33,380 --> 01:45:34,550
And it's,
you know,

2676
01:45:34,551 --> 01:45:35,960
so anyway,
yeah.

2677
01:45:36,800 --> 01:45:37,890
Talk Dad,
don't tell him about,

2678
01:45:39,560 --> 01:45:40,620
oh,
I've got a note from a,

2679
01:45:40,890 --> 01:45:43,610
and go from mugsy my,
my youngest boys teacher,

2680
01:45:43,611 --> 01:45:46,410
he's like seven years old and he's not 
like seven years old.

2681
01:45:46,420 --> 01:45:48,030
He has seven years old.
It's like,

2682
01:45:48,031 --> 01:45:48,864
Hey,
he's approximately somewhere in the 

2683
01:45:49,641 --> 01:45:50,920
range.
Yeah,

2684
01:45:50,970 --> 01:45:51,803
yeah.
I tried to hide his actual age for 

2685
01:45:52,881 --> 01:45:54,640
security reasons.
And so anyway,

2686
01:45:54,641 --> 01:45:55,474
we got a note from his teacher sang,
happened a little bit of trouble 

2687
01:45:58,940 --> 01:46:02,690
finishing his assignments on time and he
just kind of wanted to check in with you

2688
01:46:02,691 --> 01:46:03,770
to see how to motivate them.

2689
01:46:04,220 --> 01:46:05,053
And this was just yesterday and I got 
this message as did my absolutely 

2690
01:46:09,261 --> 01:46:11,210
fantastic wife.
And uh,

2691
01:46:11,390 --> 01:46:13,490
so we had a funny conversation about,
well,

2692
01:46:13,520 --> 01:46:15,140
how do we respond to that?
I mean like,

2693
01:46:15,141 --> 01:46:20,141
he's seven years old,
but all of it working for a living.

2694
01:46:21,380 --> 01:46:23,720
How do you motivate them to cut and 
paste faster or something?

2695
01:46:23,721 --> 01:46:24,790
But,
so I,

2696
01:46:24,930 --> 01:46:26,450
you know,
all I could think of was food,

2697
01:46:26,560 --> 01:46:28,010
right?
Like my retriever,

2698
01:46:28,180 --> 01:46:28,870
he,
you know,

2699
01:46:28,870 --> 01:46:31,520
he's food motivated my dog.
And so I'm figuring,

2700
01:46:31,550 --> 01:46:32,310
you know,
monk,

2701
01:46:32,310 --> 01:46:33,470
he's the same way.
You know,

2702
01:46:33,530 --> 01:46:37,520
you give them a cupcake and he'll finish
that assignment.

2703
01:46:37,521 --> 01:46:41,030
So I had no idea I was really stymied,
you know,

2704
01:46:41,031 --> 01:46:43,130
because I think,
I know we all,

2705
01:46:43,131 --> 01:46:44,510
you know,
I mean our kids are,

2706
01:46:44,511 --> 01:46:45,530
you know,
like everybody else,

2707
01:46:45,531 --> 01:46:47,900
you always feel your kids,
hey great kids are smart and everything,

2708
01:46:47,901 --> 01:46:49,590
but you know,
and I,

2709
01:46:49,591 --> 01:46:50,040
so I give

2710
01:46:50,040 --> 01:46:51,780
her,
I give the teacher a lot of credit,

2711
01:46:51,800 --> 01:46:53,430
you know,
for being focused like that.

2712
01:46:53,640 --> 01:46:55,270
But at the same time I stepped back and 
I looked at,

2713
01:46:55,271 --> 01:46:57,750
I go and it's okay if he wants to slack 
off a little bit,

2714
01:46:57,900 --> 01:46:58,733
he's 77 exactly.
How do we have this obsession with 

2715
01:47:01,381 --> 01:47:03,720
getting kids to the bus?
Or like I was a,

2716
01:47:03,721 --> 01:47:04,554
I have a friend who's going to put their
kid in a Waldorf school and we were 

2717
01:47:07,741 --> 01:47:08,574
talking about that and I guess they 
don't even teach him to read until the 

2718
01:47:12,361 --> 01:47:14,620
third grade.
And my wife was like,

2719
01:47:14,640 --> 01:47:15,473
get the fuck Outta here with that 
because my youngest daughter's in the 

2720
01:47:18,841 --> 01:47:20,430
third grade,
she reads great.

2721
01:47:20,790 --> 01:47:23,280
I mean we read every night,
she reads perfectly.

2722
01:47:23,420 --> 01:47:24,253
And I'm like,
imagine if she hadn't even started 

2723
01:47:25,711 --> 01:47:27,420
learning how to read yet that,
that,

2724
01:47:27,421 --> 01:47:30,120
that and that,
that's what opens up everything else.

2725
01:47:30,510 --> 01:47:31,830
You can't,
you can't delay it.

2726
01:47:31,850 --> 01:47:33,460
That part of it.
And,

2727
01:47:33,630 --> 01:47:35,300
but yeah.
So yeah,

2728
01:47:35,310 --> 01:47:36,970
I know we finish every evening with 
they,

2729
01:47:37,020 --> 01:47:38,250
the kids have to read.
Right.

2730
01:47:38,251 --> 01:47:38,910
Get on,
you know,

2731
01:47:38,910 --> 01:47:41,370
finished reading too.
That's the other thing.

2732
01:47:41,371 --> 01:47:44,730
Like I don't think it's a bad thing to 
have kids read,

2733
01:47:44,731 --> 01:47:48,080
but what I do,
what does you heard it here?

2734
01:47:48,090 --> 01:47:51,930
First verse,
she'll taking a country writer.

2735
01:47:51,931 --> 01:47:54,270
She'll stand on reading.
I support it.

2736
01:47:55,090 --> 01:47:58,190
What does concern me though is homework,
cause uh,

2737
01:47:58,440 --> 01:47:59,540
you know,
my 10 year old,

2738
01:47:59,541 --> 01:48:02,120
sometimes she cries,
she's got so much home and she's like,

2739
01:48:02,580 --> 01:48:07,020
we're all day to school and no have to 
do two hours of women.

2740
01:48:07,670 --> 01:48:08,503
There's probably got activities to 
sports activities and so that consumes 

2741
01:48:11,641 --> 01:48:15,750
gymnastics bunch of other shit too.
It's these kids,

2742
01:48:15,810 --> 01:48:20,550
they want these kids to grow up to 
become hugely successful.

2743
01:48:20,910 --> 01:48:22,200
And you know,
they,

2744
01:48:22,201 --> 01:48:25,420
they push him so hard and everybody in 
the community is this,

2745
01:48:25,460 --> 01:48:28,170
is this,
when you're in these wealthy communities

2746
01:48:28,171 --> 01:48:28,380
too.

2747
01:48:28,380 --> 01:48:30,390
That's the other thing is all these 
other people,

2748
01:48:30,570 --> 01:48:33,000
they all,
everybody's working so hard.

2749
01:48:33,001 --> 01:48:35,460
They want their kids to work so hard to 
like Jesus.

2750
01:48:35,790 --> 01:48:36,181
I'm not,
I'm,

2751
01:48:36,181 --> 01:48:40,380
I'm in this weird spot where I'm an,
I'm an an insider outsider.

2752
01:48:41,040 --> 01:48:43,950
It's cause I'm in there and I kind of 
work hard.

2753
01:48:44,520 --> 01:48:45,880
You work hard shit.
What are you doing?

2754
01:48:45,980 --> 01:48:48,300
Kind of work hard.
It's not really work.

2755
01:48:49,140 --> 01:48:51,450
None of it's,
I have fucking scam this system.

2756
01:48:51,990 --> 01:48:56,100
I got three fake jobs.
I got three fake jobs.

2757
01:48:56,460 --> 01:48:59,310
UFC fake job,
standup comedy,

2758
01:48:59,311 --> 01:49:01,470
fake ass job,
podcasting.

2759
01:49:01,500 --> 01:49:05,070
Definitely a fake job.
I got three fake jobs.

2760
01:49:05,490 --> 01:49:09,020
They're twins is the toughest.
The toughest is right now.

2761
01:49:11,120 --> 01:49:12,750
I don't know what's the toughest,
uh,

2762
01:49:12,751 --> 01:49:14,440
probably uh,
stand up.

2763
01:49:14,500 --> 01:49:16,610
Stand up is the hardest to pull off.
How long did you,

2764
01:49:16,611 --> 01:49:17,444
let me ask you this,
how long did it take for like the set 

2765
01:49:18,961 --> 01:49:21,390
that you did up in Boise,
which was was fantastic.

2766
01:49:21,391 --> 01:49:22,530
How long did that run?
I didn't,

2767
01:49:22,560 --> 01:49:24,000
I was laughing my ass off so I didn't,
I don't,

2768
01:49:24,030 --> 01:49:28,320
I did an hour and we'd go like an hour 
and 15 minutes and that took me,

2769
01:49:28,650 --> 01:49:29,483
that was what,
when I went up to boise was a couple 

2770
01:49:31,500 --> 01:49:34,440
months before a film my special.
So that was the end of my run.

2771
01:49:34,590 --> 01:49:38,130
So what I do is I develop an act for 
like a year.

2772
01:49:38,131 --> 01:49:42,210
I tour with it for a year and then at 
the end of that tour I film a special,

2773
01:49:42,570 --> 01:49:45,030
okay.
So it takes me two years to put together

2774
01:49:45,031 --> 01:49:48,520
where it's I fucking hammer that Samurai
sword down,

2775
01:49:48,580 --> 01:49:51,250
Polish it,
and it's live performance,

2776
01:49:51,251 --> 01:49:52,180
you know,
it's fucking weird.

2777
01:49:52,180 --> 01:49:55,080
Sometimes one night a bit kills the 
other bit.

2778
01:49:55,081 --> 01:49:58,360
T night it comes out a little clunky.
You never sure how to do it.

2779
01:49:58,361 --> 01:49:59,194
It's,
it's a constant thing of an evolving it 

2780
01:50:01,961 --> 01:50:04,840
and moving it and changing it.
Do you ever just drop something?

2781
01:50:04,900 --> 01:50:05,733
Yeah,
I mean that's all the time it's been 

2782
01:50:06,191 --> 01:50:08,170
working and then you go and you think,
fuck it,

2783
01:50:08,200 --> 01:50:09,780
I don't want to do it anymore.
Yeah,

2784
01:50:09,920 --> 01:50:11,800
yeah.
You have to be enthusiastic.

2785
01:50:11,890 --> 01:50:14,210
Yeah.
Like in the beginning of Standup,

2786
01:50:14,370 --> 01:50:18,610
you treat your jokes like their tools.
Like uh oh this is a phillips head.

2787
01:50:18,611 --> 01:50:20,620
I need a phillips head screwdriver.
I'll fit that in there.

2788
01:50:20,920 --> 01:50:23,950
And then after a while you realize like,
okay,

2789
01:50:23,980 --> 01:50:24,813
let me do what I like.
I'm going to talk about shit that I 

2790
01:50:26,951 --> 01:50:27,910
like.
And then you have,

2791
01:50:27,940 --> 01:50:28,773
and then you realize,
well the art form is trying to figure 

2792
01:50:30,101 --> 01:50:31,600
out how to make ideas funny.

2793
01:50:32,840 --> 01:50:36,910
And then then it becomes,
if these ideas are funny to me,

2794
01:50:36,911 --> 01:50:38,830
I've got to figure out a way to get them
funded for other people.

2795
01:50:38,831 --> 01:50:40,750
But if they're not funny to me,
I'm not interested.

2796
01:50:41,370 --> 01:50:42,203
And then so what are you doing here?
You put something together and then you 

2797
01:50:44,531 --> 01:50:46,390
test it out on the kids are,
and homer,

2798
01:50:46,391 --> 01:50:47,190
no,
don't have to tell you.

2799
01:50:47,190 --> 01:50:48,023
No,
no.

2800
01:50:48,470 --> 01:50:49,930
You take it to like a small place,
right?

2801
01:50:50,700 --> 01:50:51,533
I take it to clubs.
I go to the Ice House and the comedy 

2802
01:50:54,101 --> 01:50:54,934
store and the Improv and I,
I go to these local places in La and I 

2803
01:50:58,481 --> 01:50:59,314
might do,
like last night I did three shows and 

2804
01:51:01,361 --> 01:51:01,931
uh,
I'll,

2805
01:51:01,931 --> 01:51:04,720
I'll do that all the time.
I'll do that.

2806
01:51:04,721 --> 01:51:06,760
I'll do four shows,
I'll do one show at the Improv,

2807
01:51:06,761 --> 01:51:08,280
three at the comedy store.
I do that all the time.

2808
01:51:08,290 --> 01:51:09,580
How long did the shows h I mean,
each,

2809
01:51:09,590 --> 01:51:10,650
each sets our,
okay.

2810
01:51:10,810 --> 01:51:12,670
Half hour,
sometimes less.

2811
01:51:12,671 --> 01:51:14,230
Sometimes must be exhausting.
I mean,

2812
01:51:14,231 --> 01:51:17,020
in a way,
talk about how it's a fake job,

2813
01:51:17,021 --> 01:51:17,854
but yeah,
I mean,

2814
01:51:18,250 --> 01:51:20,430
you gotta get up in front of people.
You don't know what the reaction's going

2815
01:51:20,431 --> 01:51:23,260
to be.
That's the best job that I do,

2816
01:51:23,261 --> 01:51:24,094
but also the most work.
But it's the best out of the fake jobs 

2817
01:51:27,041 --> 01:51:27,874
that I have.
That's the best fake job because it's 

2818
01:51:29,711 --> 01:51:30,544
the most fun.
Like,

2819
01:51:30,730 --> 01:51:33,130
you know,
the Boise thing was like 11,000 people.

2820
01:51:33,131 --> 01:51:36,970
If you crush in front of 11,000 people,
that feeling is just,

2821
01:51:37,240 --> 01:51:39,520
when you hear the roar,
like you hit a punchline,

2822
01:51:39,521 --> 01:51:43,000
you hear the roar of the crowd.
It's like there's nothing like that.

2823
01:51:43,380 --> 01:51:45,700
Nothing like that in the world.
That was,

2824
01:51:45,701 --> 01:51:46,480
it was,
uh,

2825
01:51:46,480 --> 01:51:48,240
again,
anybody get a chance to go see,

2826
01:51:48,260 --> 01:51:49,093
go see a show.
Cause this one's just go see my netflix 

2827
01:51:51,551 --> 01:51:55,330
specials so you can see that thing now 
you have to pay more for Netflix now.

2828
01:51:55,630 --> 01:51:56,770
Yeah.
What is it like 10 bucks?

2829
01:51:56,890 --> 01:51:57,970
Yeah,
17% more.

2830
01:51:57,971 --> 01:51:59,060
I think they're going to charge.
Really?

2831
01:51:59,080 --> 01:51:59,980
Yeah,
they can.

2832
01:52:00,010 --> 01:52:00,900
Yeah.
Good.

2833
01:52:01,240 --> 01:52:05,980
I have so much good shit though.
Like if you want to just waste your life

2834
01:52:06,010 --> 01:52:08,170
and sit in front of the TV,
it's crazy.

2835
01:52:08,171 --> 01:52:10,600
Like when we were kids,
maybe that's your passion.

2836
01:52:10,630 --> 01:52:11,463
So you get that universal basic income.
And my following my passion means I got 

2837
01:52:13,811 --> 01:52:17,680
to sit and watch every episode of uh,
Andy Fart under the sheets.

2838
01:52:18,260 --> 01:52:20,140
And there's a lot of people doing that 
right now.

2839
01:52:20,290 --> 01:52:22,780
I don't know if that's bad is,
I mean,

2840
01:52:22,781 --> 01:52:23,614
yes it is,
but then doesn't that open the door for 

2841
01:52:25,691 --> 01:52:26,524
the,
the people that aren't going to be like 

2842
01:52:27,581 --> 01:52:28,630
that?
Like look,

2843
01:52:28,631 --> 01:52:31,420
less people out there really actually 
trying to get ahead.

2844
01:52:31,990 --> 01:52:32,823
I think the people that are going to try
to succeed are always going to try to 

2845
01:52:34,751 --> 01:52:36,370
succeed.
I think that's true and I think so.

2846
01:52:36,371 --> 01:52:37,204
I think that's,
maybe that's an argument against it 

2847
01:52:38,411 --> 01:52:39,510
also,
which is said like,

2848
01:52:39,700 --> 01:52:44,470
I don't think it's going to unlock a 
whole treasure trove of innovators.

2849
01:52:44,471 --> 01:52:45,950
Right?
If suddenly

2850
01:52:46,010 --> 01:52:48,650
you give people money and say,
okay,

2851
01:52:48,651 --> 01:52:50,650
you don't have to go,
uh,

2852
01:52:50,780 --> 01:52:53,540
poor coffee or,
or flip burgers or you know,

2853
01:52:53,560 --> 01:52:54,393
uh,
clean up that road or whatever you're 

2854
01:52:55,311 --> 01:52:57,860
going to do for a living,
you can follow your passion.

2855
01:52:57,950 --> 01:52:58,783
I don't think we're going to find some 
exponential increase in the number of 

2856
01:53:01,101 --> 01:53:01,934
people inventing the wheel.
I just think that it's just going to be 

2857
01:53:04,161 --> 01:53:06,710
a lot more people farden under the 
blankets or something.

2858
01:53:06,711 --> 01:53:08,180
I don't know.
They might be right,

2859
01:53:08,210 --> 01:53:09,043
but the only good that I think could 
come out of it as a less people were in 

2860
01:53:12,321 --> 01:53:15,230
abject poverty and less people were 
desperate.

2861
01:53:15,231 --> 01:53:19,220
So it might reduce crime.
You might have lazy people,

2862
01:53:19,221 --> 01:53:20,054
but you might also have less people that
are inclined to steal things or do 

2863
01:53:23,871 --> 01:53:27,050
something that's illegal because their 
basic needs are taken care of.

2864
01:53:27,460 --> 01:53:29,450
That's valid point.
I read something that's,

2865
01:53:29,451 --> 01:53:30,170
it stunned me.

2866
01:53:30,170 --> 01:53:31,490
It was,
it was on a plane flying to,

2867
01:53:31,491 --> 01:53:32,660
uh,
to La.

2868
01:53:33,140 --> 01:53:33,973
Um,
and I read an article about this does 

2869
01:53:36,161 --> 01:53:39,740
strike right.
The teachers here in Los Angeles,

2870
01:53:40,040 --> 01:53:40,873
big strike,
Los Angeles unified a school authority 

2871
01:53:44,151 --> 01:53:48,040
or whatever it's called,
and it was just before they,

2872
01:53:48,050 --> 01:53:48,883
they went on strike.
But it talked about the problems at the 

2873
01:53:51,831 --> 01:53:52,664
school district has,
and I don't know whether this statistic 

2874
01:53:54,861 --> 01:53:55,694
is right.
I read it numerous times because I was 

2875
01:53:56,781 --> 01:53:59,870
so surprised by it.
80% of the,

2876
01:54:00,100 --> 01:54:04,310
uh,
families that use the Los Angeles public

2877
01:54:04,311 --> 01:54:08,840
school system are at the poverty level 
or below.

2878
01:54:09,560 --> 01:54:10,393
And that means of course,
also that they rely on the free meal 

2879
01:54:13,971 --> 01:54:14,850
assistance,
right.

2880
01:54:14,851 --> 01:54:15,684
That the schools provide,
which is kind of what was the point of 

2881
01:54:17,211 --> 01:54:19,430
the story was like,
the schools are closed right now.

2882
01:54:19,431 --> 01:54:20,150
And so,
you know,

2883
01:54:20,150 --> 01:54:21,550
kids aren't getting a chance to eat 
because they,

2884
01:54:21,560 --> 01:54:22,970
that's their only chance to get to eat.

2885
01:54:23,180 --> 01:54:25,580
Right.
But that number was stunning.

2886
01:54:25,760 --> 01:54:26,610
That's crazy.
Right?

2887
01:54:26,670 --> 01:54:27,660
Uh,
so I don't,

2888
01:54:27,740 --> 01:54:28,573
I,
I meant to look into it and do more 

2889
01:54:29,541 --> 01:54:31,580
research to see whether the article is 
actually correct or not,

2890
01:54:31,581 --> 01:54:32,970
but hey,
it was in the newspaper,

2891
01:54:32,971 --> 01:54:34,220
so it must be true,
right?

2892
01:54:35,270 --> 01:54:36,800
I Dunno about that.
Anyway.

2893
01:54:36,860 --> 01:54:37,910
Uh,
yeah,

2894
01:54:38,210 --> 01:54:40,550
he's a disturbing number.
It's a very disturbing number.

2895
01:54:40,551 --> 01:54:41,384
But it also talked about how 12%,
I think 12% of all kids that go to high 

2896
01:54:46,491 --> 01:54:50,150
school here in Los Angeles then go on to
college,

2897
01:54:50,210 --> 01:54:52,460
12%.
And uh,

2898
01:54:52,461 --> 01:54:53,294
it was a similar number that never get 
out of high school and it's even worse 

2899
01:54:56,361 --> 01:54:58,100
than a place like New York City public 
schools.

2900
01:54:58,190 --> 01:55:00,500
So I guess the point being is a public 
school system is,

2901
01:55:00,501 --> 01:55:03,770
is it's dog shit in the larger urban 
centers.

2902
01:55:03,771 --> 01:55:04,604
It's got some real problems.
And I think a lot of those people that 

2903
01:55:05,961 --> 01:55:06,794
are the really sad things,
a lot of those people that are at the 

2904
01:55:08,871 --> 01:55:13,280
poverty line or below work hard,
it's not a lack of motivation and said,

2905
01:55:13,281 --> 01:55:14,510
just don't have opportunities.

2906
01:55:14,510 --> 01:55:17,300
They don't know what to do.
That not doing it the right way.

2907
01:55:17,301 --> 01:55:18,134
They don't have guidance.
They never learned correctly when they 

2908
01:55:20,211 --> 01:55:21,800
were young,
single parent.

2909
01:55:21,801 --> 01:55:23,210
They've,
what's the two or three jobs?

2910
01:55:23,500 --> 01:55:25,120
Um,
and no,

2911
01:55:25,140 --> 01:55:27,440
but I love California has got all sorts 
of interesting issues.

2912
01:55:27,441 --> 01:55:28,040
I mean,
there's,

2913
01:55:28,040 --> 01:55:29,090
uh,
you know,

2914
01:55:30,080 --> 01:55:31,760
talking to some folks and they said,
uh,

2915
01:55:32,570 --> 01:55:35,810
a quarter of the nation's homeless 
people live here in California.

2916
01:55:36,770 --> 01:55:41,270
25% of the nation's homeless people live
in California and a place to live.

2917
01:55:41,271 --> 01:55:41,770
Yeah.
Well,

2918
01:55:41,770 --> 01:55:42,131
I mean,
yeah,

2919
01:55:42,131 --> 01:55:43,860
I mean,
he's raised in the last few days.

2920
01:55:44,160 --> 01:55:46,410
Most of the times it's beautiful 
weather.

2921
01:55:46,411 --> 01:55:48,090
Hey,
can't complain about the weather anyway,

2922
01:55:48,100 --> 01:55:49,800
but it is crazy.
And,

2923
01:55:49,980 --> 01:55:52,020
and it also talks about how a lot of 
those people,

2924
01:55:52,170 --> 01:55:54,330
they work,
but they're homeless,

2925
01:55:54,331 --> 01:55:55,470
right?
The cost of housing.

2926
01:55:55,770 --> 01:55:58,740
And so you've got people that have a job
but they're living in their cars,

2927
01:55:59,040 --> 01:55:59,220
right?

2928
01:55:59,220 --> 01:56:00,053
Because they can't afford housing,
whether it's in San Francisco or Los 

2929
01:56:04,140 --> 01:56:05,240
Angeles.
Insanity.

2930
01:56:05,310 --> 01:56:06,143
Yeah.
That is,

2931
01:56:06,240 --> 01:56:07,073
that place is insanity.
So your point about the basic universal 

2932
01:56:09,301 --> 01:56:10,500
income,
I take that point.

2933
01:56:10,530 --> 01:56:12,900
I see what that,
you know,

2934
01:56:13,170 --> 01:56:18,150
if it was possible to pay for it and uh,
and again,

2935
01:56:18,570 --> 01:56:20,220
you know,
kind of do this thing where you,

2936
01:56:20,370 --> 01:56:21,203
you're monitoring this issue of 
motivation so you're not creating 

2937
01:56:22,891 --> 01:56:25,470
another follow on generation of just 
complete slack acids.

2938
01:56:25,830 --> 01:56:28,530
Then I think that's it.
That's a really valid point.

2939
01:56:28,800 --> 01:56:29,633
I,
my concern would be people that didn't 

2940
01:56:31,501 --> 01:56:33,900
appreciate it and people that felt 
entitled,

2941
01:56:34,320 --> 01:56:36,720
like they felt like someone owed them 
that money.

2942
01:56:37,560 --> 01:56:39,210
You're going to have that.
I mean this is the,

2943
01:56:39,211 --> 01:56:40,044
this is the biggest problem that people 
have with socialism and socialist 

2944
01:56:41,941 --> 01:56:44,220
attitudes that some of these kids that 
are coming up right now,

2945
01:56:44,430 --> 01:56:47,280
they look at what they call income 
inequality,

2946
01:56:47,430 --> 01:56:50,310
what they don't look at his effort 
inequality.

2947
01:56:50,700 --> 01:56:55,700
Like some people put in more fucking 
work and are smarter.

2948
01:56:55,711 --> 01:56:56,544
They've figured their way through the 
game better than you have been doing it 

2949
01:56:59,881 --> 01:57:01,900
for 50 years or whatever they brain.
Right.

2950
01:57:02,490 --> 01:57:05,090
I couldn't agree with him more in the 
sense that I,

2951
01:57:05,580 --> 01:57:06,413
I never begrudged anybody.
I never got pissed off with a rich 

2952
01:57:09,871 --> 01:57:11,880
person because they were rich.
Right.

2953
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:12,750
I think it,
hey,

2954
01:57:12,750 --> 01:57:14,400
that's good.
I'd like to be rich.

2955
01:57:14,460 --> 01:57:14,940
Right.
Right.

2956
01:57:14,940 --> 01:57:16,980
So I might want to talk and find out,
hey,

2957
01:57:17,070 --> 01:57:18,420
how'd you do it?
Or how'd you do it?

2958
01:57:18,421 --> 01:57:19,800
And yeah,
it's a system sometimes,

2959
01:57:19,950 --> 01:57:22,470
you know,
set up so that once you have some money,

2960
01:57:22,471 --> 01:57:23,610
you can get more money.
Well,

2961
01:57:23,611 --> 01:57:25,080
of course the fuck it is.
Yeah.

2962
01:57:25,260 --> 01:57:25,560
I mean,
I,

2963
01:57:25,560 --> 01:57:26,393
if I have some money,
I can invest that money and make more 

2964
01:57:27,811 --> 01:57:30,030
money if I'm smart about it,
if I do it right.

2965
01:57:30,050 --> 01:57:30,751
Yeah.
If you do it right.

2966
01:57:30,751 --> 01:57:32,160
But I absolutely,
I don't,

2967
01:57:32,310 --> 01:57:33,143
and I don't begrudge the idea that's it.
So that's part of it is also fairly 

2968
01:57:36,901 --> 01:57:38,270
steeped in the idea that,
you know,

2969
01:57:38,580 --> 01:57:40,050
we're living in a very,
uh,

2970
01:57:40,240 --> 01:57:41,700
unique country.
Right.

2971
01:57:41,701 --> 01:57:45,540
And I do worry sometimes that people 
don't,

2972
01:57:46,610 --> 01:57:47,500
you know,
I,

2973
01:57:47,501 --> 01:57:48,120
I,
you know,

2974
01:57:48,120 --> 01:57:48,953
even family and I've got some friends 
and others who were just constantly 

2975
01:57:51,181 --> 01:57:53,790
pissing and moaning about this place.
And I'm thinking,

2976
01:57:53,791 --> 01:57:58,080
I spent almost all my life over and shit
holes around the world and I,

2977
01:57:58,590 --> 01:58:00,990
there is no other place I would rather 
be as a country.

2978
01:58:00,991 --> 01:58:01,681
And I know that's,
you know,

2979
01:58:01,681 --> 01:58:03,950
it's jingoistic or whatever.
But uh,

2980
01:58:04,080 --> 01:58:05,760
honest to God,
I still believe,

2981
01:58:05,761 --> 01:58:08,940
and if you go someplace and you've 
talked to somebody in some fifth world,

2982
01:58:09,360 --> 01:58:12,180
they will also have,
my experience has been any way,

2983
01:58:12,470 --> 01:58:14,340
uh,
maybe you're listening in,

2984
01:58:14,341 --> 01:58:15,174
your experience is different,
but that's the way it works is that 

2985
01:58:17,880 --> 01:58:21,690
they'll think if I go to America,
if I can get to America and I work hard,

2986
01:58:21,720 --> 01:58:23,730
I can,
I can be successful.

2987
01:58:24,060 --> 01:58:24,893
And that I think is still true.
And that's what I worry about with 

2988
01:58:27,361 --> 01:58:30,870
entitlements and thinks that that make 
kill that belief.

2989
01:58:30,871 --> 01:58:32,300
And you're right,
incoming inequality.

2990
01:58:32,750 --> 01:58:33,350
Yeah,
no,

2991
01:58:33,350 --> 01:58:35,250
that's,
but it's your right,

2992
01:58:35,251 --> 01:58:37,410
you work harder now.
It doesn't always happen,

2993
01:58:37,411 --> 01:58:38,630
but life's not supposed to be fair.
It's,

2994
01:58:38,720 --> 01:58:39,780
well,
it's maybe it's supposed to be fair,

2995
01:58:39,781 --> 01:58:41,230
but it's not fair.
So

2996
01:58:41,890 --> 01:58:43,620
sorry,
I was just supposed to be life.

2997
01:58:43,760 --> 01:58:45,280
It's definitely not fair.
Yeah.

2998
01:58:45,820 --> 01:58:46,440
Yeah.
It's,

2999
01:58:46,440 --> 01:58:47,250
uh,
I,

3000
01:58:47,250 --> 01:58:50,350
I completely see your point and I,
and I agree with it.

3001
01:58:50,650 --> 01:58:51,483
I think that the real concern is that 
people don't appreciate already how 

3002
01:58:55,001 --> 01:58:57,850
great they have and what incredible 
opportunity they have.

3003
01:58:58,210 --> 01:58:59,043
And if we increase w w we give them more
benefits with less effort than you're 

3004
01:59:03,551 --> 01:59:06,220
going to develop more of this attitude 
that we find disturbing,

3005
01:59:06,221 --> 01:59:07,054
which is people that don't have an 
appreciation for literally the greatest 

3006
01:59:10,870 --> 01:59:13,240
experiment in self government,
the world has ever known.

3007
01:59:13,241 --> 01:59:13,660
Yeah,

3008
01:59:13,660 --> 01:59:14,130
yeah.
No,

3009
01:59:14,130 --> 01:59:14,963
I,
I,

3010
01:59:15,210 --> 01:59:16,043
but I think also that there's,
there's parts of it that need to be 

3011
01:59:18,700 --> 01:59:19,451
looked at.
Like there's,

3012
01:59:19,451 --> 01:59:20,800
it,
there's an interesting study about,

3013
01:59:20,801 --> 01:59:21,930
uh,
uh,

3014
01:59:21,970 --> 01:59:26,950
about college and graduation rates from 
college for,

3015
01:59:27,370 --> 01:59:28,810
um,
for,

3016
01:59:28,870 --> 01:59:30,790
uh,
disadvantaged folks.

3017
01:59:30,820 --> 01:59:31,870
You know,
and that was again,

3018
01:59:31,871 --> 01:59:34,960
why they made it easier for tuition 
assistance.

3019
01:59:34,961 --> 01:59:35,794
Right?
So the idea was we want to expand the 

3020
01:59:38,351 --> 01:59:41,290
college ability for everybody,
which is a great idea.

3021
01:59:41,350 --> 01:59:42,183
Right?
But what they found was they expanded 

3022
01:59:43,571 --> 01:59:43,910
the,
the,

3023
01:59:43,910 --> 01:59:44,430
the,
the,

3024
01:59:44,430 --> 01:59:48,640
the college opportunity for everybody.
But over the past decade,

3025
01:59:48,670 --> 01:59:52,180
decade and a half,
fewer people from the lower income,

3026
01:59:52,480 --> 01:59:53,830
uh,
uh,

3027
01:59:53,860 --> 01:59:56,350
categories have been graduating.
Right?

3028
01:59:56,410 --> 01:59:58,090
So you've,
what you've done is you said,

3029
01:59:58,091 --> 01:59:59,050
come on in.
It's like,

3030
01:59:59,630 --> 02:00:01,570
you know,
it's like a special operators,

3031
02:00:01,571 --> 02:00:02,080
right?
If,

3032
02:00:02,080 --> 02:00:03,700
if,
if you lower the bar,

3033
02:00:03,810 --> 02:00:04,680
right?
Right.

3034
02:00:04,750 --> 02:00:05,583
Um,
and this is where I'm going to get in 

3035
02:00:06,851 --> 02:00:07,360
trouble probably.

3036
02:00:07,360 --> 02:00:09,100
I'll talk about the marines and you 
know,

3037
02:00:09,190 --> 02:00:11,680
allowing women into combat elements.
I know,

3038
02:00:11,681 --> 02:00:13,400
oh my God,
well what did they do?

3039
02:00:13,430 --> 02:00:14,830
Well,
you lower the bar.

3040
02:00:14,870 --> 02:00:15,880
[inaudible] you make it,
you know?

3041
02:00:15,960 --> 02:00:16,793
Okay,
well not enough of them could get 

3042
02:00:17,711 --> 02:00:21,190
through the course.
So I'm going to change the regulations.

3043
02:00:21,790 --> 02:00:23,770
And so if you change the regulations,
what they found,

3044
02:00:23,771 --> 02:00:25,150
where the college was,
if you,

3045
02:00:25,151 --> 02:00:27,460
if you increase that pool of people 
going,

3046
02:00:27,461 --> 02:00:29,560
it doesn't mean that they're going to be
successful.

3047
02:00:29,710 --> 02:00:30,543
Right?
And now what you've done is you've kind 

3048
02:00:31,391 --> 02:00:34,660
of saddle them with some college debt 
and they didn't graduate.

3049
02:00:35,020 --> 02:00:35,853
So they're still earning what a high 
school graduate earns and the system 

3050
02:00:39,371 --> 02:00:40,204
doesn't work.
And so I think sometimes just the idea 

3051
02:00:42,221 --> 02:00:43,680
of throwing money at the problem or,
or,

3052
02:00:43,740 --> 02:00:44,573
or it doesn't,
it's not helpful if we don't think it 

3053
02:00:47,681 --> 02:00:49,900
through and then assess the results.
So,

3054
02:00:50,350 --> 02:00:50,861
but yeah,
that,

3055
02:00:50,861 --> 02:00:52,450
that,
that whole marine experiment,

3056
02:00:52,550 --> 02:00:53,200
I think

3057
02:00:53,200 --> 02:00:54,033
they're,
they're catching it laid in the chain 

3058
02:00:55,760 --> 02:00:56,593
and I think it's good to give people the
opportunity to succeed and to advance 

3059
02:01:00,561 --> 02:01:01,394
themselves.
But if you really want to address it as 

3060
02:01:03,111 --> 02:01:05,930
a systemic problem,
you got to get to the root of it,

3061
02:01:05,931 --> 02:01:09,980
which is these unbelievably horrible 
neighborhoods and these,

3062
02:01:10,010 --> 02:01:10,843
these toxic environments that these kids
are growing up and being abused and 

3063
02:01:14,210 --> 02:01:18,380
being scared and bullied and terrible 
piss poor education,

3064
02:01:18,650 --> 02:01:19,483
you know,
first through all the way up to high 

3065
02:01:22,071 --> 02:01:23,030
school.
That's,

3066
02:01:23,450 --> 02:01:24,283
I mean,
that's really where you have to address 

3067
02:01:25,131 --> 02:01:25,520
it.
I mean,

3068
02:01:25,520 --> 02:01:26,353
addressing,
adjust at the college level and giving 

3069
02:01:27,891 --> 02:01:30,650
them the opportunity to get into college
and making it easier for them.

3070
02:01:31,100 --> 02:01:31,933
It doesn't negate the terrible 
foundation that's been laid by their 

3071
02:01:35,571 --> 02:01:36,120
life.

3072
02:01:36,120 --> 02:01:36,953
But yeah,
and I think we had this idea that 

3073
02:01:39,680 --> 02:01:41,130
college should be for everybody.
Right.

3074
02:01:41,150 --> 02:01:42,120
And that's okay.
That's great.

3075
02:01:42,121 --> 02:01:43,130
And that's,
I think that's where the,

3076
02:01:43,340 --> 02:01:44,173
you know,
people like Cortez and Bernie Sanders 

3077
02:01:45,591 --> 02:01:48,110
and others with their idea of free 
tuition,

3078
02:01:48,670 --> 02:01:49,550
you know,
they're thinking,

3079
02:01:49,551 --> 02:01:51,200
okay,
well look at Europe.

3080
02:01:51,230 --> 02:01:52,063
You know,
there's some countries in Europe have 

3081
02:01:52,911 --> 02:01:54,230
free tuition and hey,
it's,

3082
02:01:54,231 --> 02:01:55,064
you know,
it's relatively prosperous and there's 

3083
02:01:55,761 --> 02:01:58,070
nothing wrong with that.
But at the same time,

3084
02:01:59,780 --> 02:02:01,010
you know,
I think we,

3085
02:02:01,040 --> 02:02:02,870
we don't,
we,

3086
02:02:03,020 --> 02:02:07,190
we don't assess the cost and the overall
efficiency of an idea sometimes.

3087
02:02:07,460 --> 02:02:08,293
And so we just assume and open it up,
let everybody go and somehow this is 

3088
02:02:13,011 --> 02:02:13,844
going to work right.
To our advantage and honest got answer 

3089
02:02:16,671 --> 02:02:18,500
is no,
you know,

3090
02:02:18,501 --> 02:02:20,450
I think somebody is better off 
sometimes,

3091
02:02:20,451 --> 02:02:21,360
you know,
go into,

3092
02:02:21,640 --> 02:02:22,940
you know,
becoming a plumber,

3093
02:02:23,540 --> 02:02:24,500
you know,
maybe,

3094
02:02:24,530 --> 02:02:25,540
maybe not honorable living.

3095
02:02:25,540 --> 02:02:27,110
It's a living great.
Yeah.

3096
02:02:27,250 --> 02:02:28,083
To create living.
One of the happiest guys I know is my 

3097
02:02:30,681 --> 02:02:32,780
plumber in Boise.
That guy is,

3098
02:02:32,840 --> 02:02:34,370
I mean,
he's got it knocked right.

3099
02:02:34,371 --> 02:02:37,130
He's always out for hunting season and 
you know,

3100
02:02:37,131 --> 02:02:37,761
he'll call,
I'll say,

3101
02:02:37,761 --> 02:02:38,380
look,
I gotta,

3102
02:02:38,380 --> 02:02:39,530
I gotta Lick,
right?

3103
02:02:39,560 --> 02:02:41,540
I'm a if my ceilings about the cave.
And he goes,

3104
02:02:41,541 --> 02:02:44,240
well,
I'm going hunting and sorry,

3105
02:02:44,690 --> 02:02:46,820
he's just got,
he's got his own schedule.

3106
02:02:46,940 --> 02:02:47,773
Right.
But he's got a great job and there's 

3107
02:02:49,821 --> 02:02:52,550
nothing wrong with that.
But I think we developed this idea.

3108
02:02:52,551 --> 02:02:53,384
So like homeownership,
everybody should own a home when we saw 

3109
02:02:55,161 --> 02:02:56,250
with that took us,
right?

3110
02:02:56,260 --> 02:02:57,093
Yeah.
When you lower the requirements and 

3111
02:02:58,341 --> 02:02:59,290
suddenly we're all,
you know,

3112
02:02:59,291 --> 02:03:01,910
it's blown up and we're fucked.
But anyway,

3113
02:03:02,020 --> 02:03:02,853
uh,
what do I know?

3114
02:03:02,900 --> 02:03:03,733
What do I,
what's the,

3115
02:03:04,560 --> 02:03:07,560
what do I know either,
but I see your points and I know,

3116
02:03:07,640 --> 02:03:08,473
I know what you're saying.
I think that one thing to disturb the 

3117
02:03:10,591 --> 02:03:12,660
shit out of me,
his student loans,

3118
02:03:13,140 --> 02:03:13,973
I mean you w one of the worst ways to 
prepare a kid for the futures to saddle 

3119
02:03:16,981 --> 02:03:17,814
them down with a quarter million dollars
worth of debt by the time they graduate 

3120
02:03:19,771 --> 02:03:21,420
from college right now.
Absolutely.

3121
02:03:21,450 --> 02:03:24,060
And then they get a $50,000 a year job 
and they're like,

3122
02:03:24,061 --> 02:03:24,894
what in the,
and they're doing well with a $50,000 a 

3123
02:03:27,361 --> 02:03:29,850
year job.
That's a great job to get out of college

3124
02:03:29,851 --> 02:03:33,180
and in you just look at the debt that 
you have and you're like,

3125
02:03:33,181 --> 02:03:35,910
what the fuck is this?
How am I going to pay this shit?

3126
02:03:35,970 --> 02:03:36,331
Yeah.
No,

3127
02:03:36,331 --> 02:03:38,560
I know.
And we have sold a student's a bill.

3128
02:03:38,561 --> 02:03:39,710
A good yes.
And,

3129
02:03:40,480 --> 02:03:41,450
and,
and you know,

3130
02:03:41,490 --> 02:03:42,061
some of it.
Okay.

3131
02:03:42,061 --> 02:03:43,140
Some of it's on them,
right?

3132
02:03:43,141 --> 02:03:43,760
Some of it,
you know,

3133
02:03:43,760 --> 02:03:44,593
the older students are the ones who are 
willing to take out this loan and then 

3134
02:03:46,861 --> 02:03:48,300
suddenly they're using the money for 
something else.

3135
02:03:48,301 --> 02:03:48,960
Okay,
fine.

3136
02:03:48,960 --> 02:03:51,480
There's individual responsibility.
But no,

3137
02:03:51,481 --> 02:03:53,290
I agree with you that there's student 
loan debt is a,

3138
02:03:53,291 --> 02:03:54,124
is a major issue.
We occasionally that the Capitol Hill 

3139
02:03:56,131 --> 02:03:58,020
talks about it,
but not really.

3140
02:03:58,021 --> 02:03:59,310
I told,
I told my daughter,

3141
02:03:59,340 --> 02:04:01,260
who's a fantastic person and I said,
you know,

3142
02:04:01,261 --> 02:04:05,130
the biggest gift you're getting is 
getting out of college without any,

3143
02:04:05,160 --> 02:04:06,720
any debt.
That's,

3144
02:04:06,870 --> 02:04:08,340
you know,
so you know,

3145
02:04:08,400 --> 02:04:10,320
dad's not going to buy you your own 
wagon here.

3146
02:04:10,810 --> 02:04:15,140
You got to pick out your tuition and 
that's it.

3147
02:04:15,170 --> 02:04:16,360
That's it.
That's the best I can.

3148
02:04:16,380 --> 02:04:19,860
That's a gigantic headstart for kids.
I mean,

3149
02:04:19,870 --> 02:04:21,850
it sounds so fucked up,
but it's true.

3150
02:04:21,851 --> 02:04:24,720
To not be in debt is gigantic.
Look,

3151
02:04:24,910 --> 02:04:25,743
they're giving kids credit cards and 
their frontal lobes aren't even 

3152
02:04:27,641 --> 02:04:29,590
developed yet.
They're doing all kinds of wacky.

3153
02:04:29,591 --> 02:04:30,221
They're like,
wow,

3154
02:04:30,221 --> 02:04:32,440
I'll figure it out.
But you ain't figuring out shit.

3155
02:04:32,470 --> 02:04:33,303
He never figured out things up till now.
And the idea that you're going to get 

3156
02:04:35,741 --> 02:04:38,130
magically smarter over the next months 
while you owe

3157
02:04:38,130 --> 02:04:39,540
all this money is crazy.
Right?

3158
02:04:40,070 --> 02:04:45,070
You kids oldest have a phone yet for 
security purposes or what is this?

3159
02:04:45,091 --> 02:04:45,924
What do you got here?
Jamie?

3160
02:04:46,150 --> 02:04:50,640
Student loan clock.
Oh my God,

3161
02:04:50,850 --> 02:04:52,170
what is,
I can't even figure out what that is.

3162
02:04:52,200 --> 02:04:55,740
One point 6 trillion try got really good
at go.

3163
02:04:56,070 --> 02:04:56,903
Oh,
so what is this website that people can 

3164
02:04:58,921 --> 02:04:59,754
go to?
This college debt.com I just typed in 

3165
02:05:01,040 --> 02:05:03,450
student loan.
Holy Shit.

3166
02:05:04,850 --> 02:05:05,683
Look at that.
That is an insane amount of money on a 

3167
02:05:08,221 --> 02:05:09,270
second.
Something like that.

3168
02:05:09,271 --> 02:05:11,940
Is that what it is like I'm just kind of
guessing off what I'm seeing.

3169
02:05:11,941 --> 02:05:13,890
Yeah,
it's an insane amount of money.

3170
02:05:13,891 --> 02:05:16,440
So you just made that number up.
You just just stop at whatever.

3171
02:05:16,700 --> 02:05:19,890
No,
I don't look at credit cards.

3172
02:05:20,040 --> 02:05:20,873
Auto loans.
Is that the credit cards and auto loans 

3173
02:05:22,471 --> 02:05:24,780
for us?
All of us Americans are students.

3174
02:05:25,110 --> 02:05:26,880
And then those,
it's all credit card debt.

3175
02:05:26,910 --> 02:05:29,890
When I just looked at two on another 
page that had a clock at that,

3176
02:05:29,960 --> 02:05:30,793
it's just the same number.
It said it's not including the interest 

3177
02:05:32,611 --> 02:05:37,611
on the federal loans.
That's crazy.

3178
02:05:38,510 --> 02:05:39,920
So you look at that and you think,
okay,

3179
02:05:39,921 --> 02:05:42,480
no wonder it's a,
it's a popular idea of saying you've got

3180
02:05:42,481 --> 02:05:43,314
to write down student loans,
you've got to get free tuition going on 

3181
02:05:46,160 --> 02:05:48,000
and do all these things again.
You know,

3182
02:05:48,110 --> 02:05:49,260
can the country pay for it?
I don't.

3183
02:05:49,261 --> 02:05:51,260
I don't think so.
Should we be talking about it?

3184
02:05:51,261 --> 02:05:53,360
Absolutely.
She'll be looking for other alternatives

3185
02:05:53,361 --> 02:05:54,200
and other options.
Yeah.

3186
02:05:54,201 --> 02:05:55,750
But you know,
I think it's,

3187
02:05:55,790 --> 02:05:56,623
it's,
uh,

3188
02:05:57,560 --> 02:05:58,393
you know,
we're not even willing to address the 

3189
02:05:59,211 --> 02:06:00,044
issue of social security and Medicare 
and trying to deal with entitlement to 

3190
02:06:03,661 --> 02:06:05,250
say currently exist,
which we know,

3191
02:06:05,470 --> 02:06:08,600
you know,
are going to bankrupt us at some point.

3192
02:06:08,710 --> 02:06:10,100
Right.
We know that it's not,

3193
02:06:10,101 --> 02:06:12,680
it's not a mystery and we can't deal 
with that.

3194
02:06:12,681 --> 02:06:14,900
So how are we going to deal with these 
other issues?

3195
02:06:15,110 --> 02:06:17,220
Well,
that's the question I had about a guy

3196
02:06:17,430 --> 02:06:20,280
trump who doesn't seem to like to pay 
attention to things.

3197
02:06:20,610 --> 02:06:21,443
How the hell is one person supposed to 
be in the director of all these various 

3198
02:06:27,271 --> 02:06:28,500
aspects of our world?

3199
02:06:29,160 --> 02:06:29,791
Yeah,
no,

3200
02:06:29,791 --> 02:06:30,101
I,
I,

3201
02:06:30,101 --> 02:06:31,050
I've heard that,
uh,

3202
02:06:31,051 --> 02:06:32,040
you know,
uh,

3203
02:06:32,400 --> 02:06:33,870
from,
uh,

3204
02:06:34,020 --> 02:06:35,450
what's the name of the economist,
uh,

3205
02:06:35,560 --> 02:06:36,600
uh,
uh,

3206
02:06:36,870 --> 02:06:38,100
can't remember his name,
but it went very,

3207
02:06:38,130 --> 02:06:38,963
very smart guy,
very smart economist who was talking 

3208
02:06:40,861 --> 02:06:43,800
about this and saying,
this is what we expect of a president.

3209
02:06:43,801 --> 02:06:46,870
Think about all these things the 
president has to be cognizant of and,

3210
02:06:46,871 --> 02:06:47,704
and,
and supposedly capable of digesting a 

3211
02:06:49,621 --> 02:06:52,680
lot of information and making decisions 
on a very number of things.

3212
02:06:52,950 --> 02:06:53,551
And obviously,
yeah,

3213
02:06:53,551 --> 02:06:54,384
you delegate and you're fine.
But it is an interesting system and it 

3214
02:06:59,191 --> 02:07:00,330
is interesting how,
you know,

3215
02:07:00,420 --> 02:07:01,253
I mean right now there's a lot of people
that don't have faith in the current 

3216
02:07:03,211 --> 02:07:04,290
president to make,
you know,

3217
02:07:04,291 --> 02:07:06,390
some of your basic decisions,
uh,

3218
02:07:06,420 --> 02:07:07,253
previous administration,
there are a lot of people that was 

3219
02:07:08,191 --> 02:07:11,340
convinced he could understand anything,
right?

3220
02:07:11,341 --> 02:07:13,380
I mean,
he was capable of all of it.

3221
02:07:13,650 --> 02:07:17,100
So I don't think the job itself is too 
big.

3222
02:07:17,400 --> 02:07:21,630
And I just think that the way that we,
uh,

3223
02:07:21,780 --> 02:07:25,710
go through the selection process has 
slowly over a period of time,

3224
02:07:25,900 --> 02:07:28,800
you know,
gone downhill and is kind of resulted in

3225
02:07:28,801 --> 02:07:30,220
what we're doing right now.
Part of it's the,

3226
02:07:30,230 --> 02:07:32,640
the bullshit primary process,
you know,

3227
02:07:32,641 --> 02:07:34,890
and the way that we do the initial 
selection,

3228
02:07:35,110 --> 02:07:35,651
there's,
there's,

3229
02:07:35,651 --> 02:07:36,040
you know,
there's

3230
02:07:36,040 --> 02:07:38,090
a lot of things I suppose.
Sure.

3231
02:07:38,150 --> 02:07:38,983
The fact that you have to be registered 
as a Democrat or Republican to vote in 

3232
02:07:41,051 --> 02:07:44,230
the primaries and all those things,
and then,

3233
02:07:44,260 --> 02:07:45,130
you know,
it was just

3234
02:07:46,750 --> 02:07:47,930
everything.
Like the,

3235
02:07:47,940 --> 02:07:50,860
the whole thing is a big mess.
But on the flip side,

3236
02:07:50,861 --> 02:07:53,530
here's what's crazy.
Trump doesn't seem to be aging.

3237
02:07:55,050 --> 02:07:58,930
Everybody.
I really think it says age is so hard.

3238
02:07:59,290 --> 02:08:00,123
They age so hard because they're paying 
attention to everything and they have 

3239
02:08:02,771 --> 02:08:04,090
real concern.
Well,

3240
02:08:04,480 --> 02:08:05,313
yeah,
that seems to be just like I've fucking 

3241
02:08:07,241 --> 02:08:08,740
water on a duck's back.
Well,

3242
02:08:08,741 --> 02:08:09,700
you know,
maybe he's,

3243
02:08:09,701 --> 02:08:10,534
he's going to outlive with salt.
Maybe he's figured out how to avoid the 

3244
02:08:12,401 --> 02:08:13,234
stress.

3245
02:08:14,030 --> 02:08:14,421
Yeah.
Oh,

3246
02:08:14,421 --> 02:08:15,254
you remember what prison Obama looked 
like when he finally walked out office 

3247
02:08:17,090 --> 02:08:19,130
or Bill Clinton?
I saw Bill Clinton not too long ago.

3248
02:08:19,131 --> 02:08:21,710
We went down a little rock.
And you saw him?

3249
02:08:21,740 --> 02:08:22,573
Yeah,
he was at an event that we were 

3250
02:08:24,380 --> 02:08:26,540
relatively small dinner and chasing 
pussy.

3251
02:08:28,230 --> 02:08:29,063
Yeah.
I'm not saying he touched me 

3252
02:08:29,581 --> 02:08:30,790
inappropriately,
but you know,

3253
02:08:32,140 --> 02:08:33,600
want to know where I got my burner 
phone.

3254
02:08:33,601 --> 02:08:35,750
Have to be a fly on the room.
Oh,

3255
02:08:35,780 --> 02:08:38,330
fly on the wall in a room with that.
I,

3256
02:08:38,390 --> 02:08:40,430
I will say this much about him.
He was,

3257
02:08:41,060 --> 02:08:42,350
uh,
we started talking.

3258
02:08:42,351 --> 02:08:44,190
I thought it was just going to go up and
shake his hand and say,

3259
02:08:44,191 --> 02:08:46,370
you know,
hey ms president,

3260
02:08:46,400 --> 02:08:47,233
you know,
good to see you.

3261
02:08:47,780 --> 02:08:49,490
Because I always liked the guy.
Right.

3262
02:08:49,491 --> 02:08:50,240
And okay.
You know,

3263
02:08:50,240 --> 02:08:51,800
uh,
aside from his obvious,

3264
02:08:51,801 --> 02:08:54,170
you know,
issue and the problem we had in terms of

3265
02:08:54,171 --> 02:08:55,580
his ability to,
to,

3266
02:08:55,581 --> 02:08:56,271
uh,
to,

3267
02:08:56,271 --> 02:08:58,760
to govern and the fact that he's a,
he's a smart son of a bitch.

3268
02:08:59,120 --> 02:09:01,520
Um,
and he,

3269
02:09:01,580 --> 02:09:03,230
uh,
I just found him,

3270
02:09:03,320 --> 02:09:04,180
uh,
you know,

3271
02:09:04,190 --> 02:09:05,960
capable of the job,
right?

3272
02:09:05,980 --> 02:09:07,990
I just like it did with President Bush 
and you know,

3273
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:08,833
they were good aspects of president.
[inaudible] I thought I have a dog in 

3274
02:09:10,521 --> 02:09:11,210
the hunt,
right?

3275
02:09:11,210 --> 02:09:12,043
I mean,
I'd rather see the results in the 

3276
02:09:13,041 --> 02:09:14,270
person.
But anyway,

3277
02:09:14,271 --> 02:09:16,520
talking to President Clinton,
he,

3278
02:09:16,521 --> 02:09:17,354
uh,
we started talking and he immediately 

3279
02:09:19,251 --> 02:09:21,410
went to a,
an old,

3280
02:09:21,430 --> 02:09:22,370
uh,
agency,

3281
02:09:22,420 --> 02:09:23,253
uh,
operation and old thing that had 

3282
02:09:24,621 --> 02:09:28,700
happened during his time when he was 
president to talk about it.

3283
02:09:29,390 --> 02:09:31,790
And you could tell that he,
I mean,

3284
02:09:31,791 --> 02:09:34,100
he had retained a tremendous amount of 
information.

3285
02:09:34,101 --> 02:09:34,934
Right.
And we were talking and we ended up 

3286
02:09:36,651 --> 02:09:37,484
talking for 15 minutes or so,
just kind of about this particular 

3287
02:09:39,651 --> 02:09:41,470
incident.
And he was kind of curious and he wanted

3288
02:09:41,471 --> 02:09:42,110
to,
you know,

3289
02:09:42,110 --> 02:09:42,943
and he wanted to recount some of the 
thought process that they were going 

3290
02:09:45,411 --> 02:09:46,244
through.
And,

3291
02:09:46,310 --> 02:09:48,860
and I found it really interesting in the
sense that that was a,

3292
02:09:49,160 --> 02:09:53,510
it was a surprisingly deep conversation,
right.

3293
02:09:53,511 --> 02:09:54,344
For any,
and he's curious and I always thought 

3294
02:09:57,021 --> 02:10:00,620
that was the most important quality for 
anybody who gets in that job is he's,

3295
02:10:00,840 --> 02:10:02,450
they have to be curious,
right?

3296
02:10:02,451 --> 02:10:05,480
They have to be inquisitive and,
um,

3297
02:10:05,810 --> 02:10:07,130
you know,
on the scale of,

3298
02:10:07,160 --> 02:10:08,330
you know,
presidents,

3299
02:10:08,331 --> 02:10:09,950
where does the current president,
you know,

3300
02:10:10,040 --> 02:10:11,870
exist in,
in the curiosity scale?

3301
02:10:11,871 --> 02:10:12,704
I don't know.
But I think that's probably not his 

3302
02:10:13,731 --> 02:10:14,564
strong suit.

3303
02:10:14,570 --> 02:10:16,550
So maybe that's one of the reasons why 
he's not aging.

3304
02:10:16,551 --> 02:10:18,260
It's because he,
he's,

3305
02:10:18,350 --> 02:10:19,183
you know,
he's not asking that fourth or fifth 

3306
02:10:20,001 --> 02:10:21,500
question that leads you to the point 
where you go,

3307
02:10:21,501 --> 02:10:22,334
Huh,
that's a pretty fucked up situation now 

3308
02:10:23,121 --> 02:10:26,240
we got to worry about that one.
So maybe it is,

3309
02:10:26,300 --> 02:10:27,800
you know,
water off the back and he's,

3310
02:10:27,801 --> 02:10:28,760
and he's,
uh,

3311
02:10:28,790 --> 02:10:30,770
he's figured out a way to deal with 
stress.

3312
02:10:31,040 --> 02:10:31,590
Well,
the,

3313
02:10:31,590 --> 02:10:32,423
on the plus side,
he seems to be making business owners 

3314
02:10:35,901 --> 02:10:36,734
happy.
It seems at least ones that aren't 

3315
02:10:38,151 --> 02:10:41,000
affected by the sanctions against China 
because a,

3316
02:10:41,001 --> 02:10:41,834
there's like steel manufacturing and a 
lot of other companies that are very 

3317
02:10:43,971 --> 02:10:45,230
upset by,
yeah.

3318
02:10:45,600 --> 02:10:46,680
Yeah.
Well I think it's,

3319
02:10:46,681 --> 02:10:47,514
it's the regulations that,
that they've done that they haven't 

3320
02:10:49,101 --> 02:10:50,240
really touted,
uh,

3321
02:10:50,241 --> 02:10:52,970
in terms of deregulating,
some of the things that make us like the

3322
02:10:52,971 --> 02:10:54,410
previous administration,
you know,

3323
02:10:54,411 --> 02:10:56,300
a lot of good points,
but some bad points.

3324
02:10:56,320 --> 02:10:58,630
One of the bad points was a sort of,
um,

3325
02:10:58,730 --> 02:10:59,620
the,
uh,

3326
02:10:59,660 --> 02:11:03,920
hamstringing of industry through a 
overregulation on everything.

3327
02:11:04,100 --> 02:11:06,550
Right?
And so lifting some of that on,

3328
02:11:06,680 --> 02:11:07,820
you know,
there's this,

3329
02:11:07,920 --> 02:11:10,100
you can argue whether,
you know,

3330
02:11:10,101 --> 02:11:11,570
you want bigger government and less 
government,

3331
02:11:11,571 --> 02:11:16,220
but you can't argue with the fact that 
it did unleashed a industry and business

3332
02:11:16,790 --> 02:11:19,790
more than the previous administration.
So that's a good thing.

3333
02:11:20,120 --> 02:11:21,790
Um,
but yeah,

3334
02:11:21,800 --> 02:11:23,000
look at all the other concerns.
I mean,

3335
02:11:23,001 --> 02:11:23,834
now we're talking about a global 
slowdown because China's numbers are 

3336
02:11:26,841 --> 02:11:28,700
looking soft.
Germany's looking soft.

3337
02:11:29,030 --> 02:11:31,310
What does that mean?
Everybody's worried about brexit.

3338
02:11:31,311 --> 02:11:33,320
So there's,
there's a lot of things for people to be

3339
02:11:33,321 --> 02:11:34,520
focused on,
you know.

3340
02:11:34,580 --> 02:11:35,413
Um,
and I worry sometimes that all we do 

3341
02:11:37,371 --> 02:11:40,100
here in the states,
it's kind of like chasing the next shiny

3342
02:11:40,130 --> 02:11:41,060
ball,
a tin foil.

3343
02:11:41,061 --> 02:11:42,470
Cause we're all a bunch of raccoons,
right?

3344
02:11:42,770 --> 02:11:45,800
We have such a short attention span for 
everything.

3345
02:11:46,310 --> 02:11:47,370
And,
uh,

3346
02:11:47,840 --> 02:11:49,190
anyway,
what am I saying?

3347
02:11:49,220 --> 02:11:51,070
I don't know.
Sorry.

3348
02:11:51,240 --> 02:11:52,073
Right.
Everybody's like,

3349
02:11:52,600 --> 02:11:54,350
well,
he was talking about attention span.

3350
02:11:54,410 --> 02:11:56,630
The last thing I'm going to definitely 
want to talk to you about,

3351
02:11:56,660 --> 02:11:57,493
it's one of the things that trump 
brought up recently is the JFK case and 

3352
02:12:02,541 --> 02:12:03,374
releasing some of the files and they 
wanted to redact the information that 

3353
02:12:08,150 --> 02:12:11,000
pertained to the people that were still 
alive.

3354
02:12:11,750 --> 02:12:14,120
Now I want to know what,
what,

3355
02:12:14,240 --> 02:12:15,073
I don't know what you could say,
but what do you think about the JFK 

3356
02:12:19,071 --> 02:12:19,904
case?
Do you think that Lee Harvey Oswald 

3357
02:12:20,900 --> 02:12:22,700
acted alone?
Um,

3358
02:12:25,460 --> 02:12:26,450
I can see

3359
02:12:28,320 --> 02:12:31,340
of all the,
of all the sort of incidents of all,

3360
02:12:32,240 --> 02:12:35,610
I don't mean to minimize it or minimize 
it by calling it an incident,

3361
02:12:35,611 --> 02:12:39,570
but of all those situations,
the Kennedy assassination and Mlk,

3362
02:12:39,571 --> 02:12:43,080
Martin Luther King's assassination,
those are the two that I understand more

3363
02:12:43,081 --> 02:12:44,850
than anything else.
Why they've linkerd,

3364
02:12:44,851 --> 02:12:47,610
why people don't believe the shit that 
they've seen and why they,

3365
02:12:47,640 --> 02:12:50,160
why they have concerns about it.
Uh,

3366
02:12:50,520 --> 02:12:55,520
Martin Luther King more than Kennedy.
I believe that there was something there

3367
02:12:55,591 --> 02:12:56,424
that we still don't understand in terms 
of who else was responsible and who 

3368
02:12:58,681 --> 02:13:01,710
organize that and who,
who assisted in that.

3369
02:13:01,840 --> 02:13:05,190
Right.
I just think of those two.

3370
02:13:05,610 --> 02:13:09,810
That's the one I've got bigger questions
on the Kennedy assassination.

3371
02:13:10,860 --> 02:13:12,840
I think that,
uh,

3372
02:13:13,470 --> 02:13:17,610
I think that Oswald pulled the trigger.
I think in his mind,

3373
02:13:17,900 --> 02:13:18,733
uh,
the reason he was doing it was for the 

3374
02:13:21,781 --> 02:13:24,750
greater good of,
of communism and to,

3375
02:13:25,050 --> 02:13:27,930
uh,
boost his image with the Soviets and,

3376
02:13:27,960 --> 02:13:28,730
and,
uh,

3377
02:13:28,730 --> 02:13:30,420
w with the Cuban regime.

3378
02:13:30,960 --> 02:13:35,040
Um,
do I think that he had assistance?

3379
02:13:36,490 --> 02:13:39,360
Um,
I don't know.

3380
02:13:39,540 --> 02:13:41,950
I don't think so,
but I could be swayed from that with,

3381
02:13:41,960 --> 02:13:44,580
with better evidence than I've seen.
But,

3382
02:13:44,930 --> 02:13:47,700
um,
I understand why people are so dug in on

3383
02:13:47,701 --> 02:13:48,271
it.
Right.

3384
02:13:48,271 --> 02:13:49,110
Because I mean,
look,

3385
02:13:49,111 --> 02:13:50,490
it was a massive event,
right?

3386
02:13:50,491 --> 02:13:54,030
It was a massive event,
but Oswald had sufficient training.

3387
02:13:54,031 --> 02:13:57,090
You did not have to be a rocket 
scientist to figure this out.

3388
02:13:57,091 --> 02:14:00,060
It was a different era and we don't 
understand it in today's terms,

3389
02:14:00,330 --> 02:14:04,500
but when you get right in that position 
and look out that window and look at the

3390
02:14:04,501 --> 02:14:08,130
shot that was taken and you know,
what was involved in that,

3391
02:14:08,131 --> 02:14:08,964
I was not,
uh,

3392
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:10,620
you know,
you've shot,

3393
02:14:10,760 --> 02:14:11,300
you know,
you've,

3394
02:14:11,300 --> 02:14:12,510
uh,
this sounds terrible,

3395
02:14:12,511 --> 02:14:13,390
but you know,
you know,

3396
02:14:13,410 --> 02:14:14,790
anybody who's hunted,
you know,

3397
02:14:14,791 --> 02:14:16,260
has taken a more difficult shot in that.

3398
02:14:16,260 --> 02:14:17,240
Yeah.
Um,

3399
02:14:17,610 --> 02:14:18,443
so that part of it and,
and his motivation and his past ties to 

3400
02:14:23,970 --> 02:14:24,803
the Soviets.
Do I think the Soviets were pulling the 

3401
02:14:25,681 --> 02:14:26,790
trigger on it too?
I think the mafia,

3402
02:14:26,791 --> 02:14:27,640
we're pulling the trigger.
I,

3403
02:14:27,930 --> 02:14:30,450
I haven't seen anything that convinces 
me that that was the case.

3404
02:14:30,451 --> 02:14:34,050
I think that Oswald felt like he was 
doing it for them or he was just,

3405
02:14:34,080 --> 02:14:36,420
he was going to prove himself in that 
regard.

3406
02:14:36,780 --> 02:14:37,613
But,
uh,

3407
02:14:37,660 --> 02:14:38,450
again,
I,

3408
02:14:38,450 --> 02:14:40,680
I understand why people are dug in the 
mlk one,

3409
02:14:40,681 --> 02:14:41,970
Martin Luther King.
I just,

3410
02:14:42,720 --> 02:14:46,620
um,
I think that,

3411
02:14:48,300 --> 02:14:51,150
I don't think he acted alone.
What makes you think that?

3412
02:14:52,850 --> 02:14:54,120
Um,
I think that,

3413
02:14:55,260 --> 02:14:56,490
look,
he was a loser,

3414
02:14:56,491 --> 02:14:58,380
a two bit criminal,
right?

3415
02:14:58,381 --> 02:14:59,214
Who was constantly getting picked up for
the shift that he was doing and ending 

3416
02:15:01,831 --> 02:15:03,570
up in jail.
But he was a mess,

3417
02:15:03,630 --> 02:15:05,820
right?
There was nothing clever about him.

3418
02:15:06,660 --> 02:15:09,330
And then leading up to the 
assassination,

3419
02:15:11,040 --> 02:15:14,490
he cleaned up his act.
Suddenly he went from looking like a two

3420
02:15:14,491 --> 02:15:15,030
bit,
you know,

3421
02:15:15,030 --> 02:15:18,870
criminal and all to a college professor 
basically.

3422
02:15:19,110 --> 02:15:20,640
And he had cash.
He was able to,

3423
02:15:20,641 --> 02:15:21,474
you know,
purchase a vehicle and he kind of went 

3424
02:15:23,341 --> 02:15:25,590
off the grid for a while.
He went onto this drive,

3425
02:15:25,591 --> 02:15:27,990
right?
And sort of stayed off the grid.

3426
02:15:28,320 --> 02:15:32,010
And he behaved in a way that he hadn't 
up until,

3427
02:15:32,130 --> 02:15:34,890
you know,
months before this thing took place.

3428
02:15:35,010 --> 02:15:37,410
And then he ended up in Europe,
you know,

3429
02:15:37,411 --> 02:15:38,490
and,
um,

3430
02:15:39,480 --> 02:15:40,910
I just,
uh,

3431
02:15:41,160 --> 02:15:44,150
something tells me that he had,
um,

3432
02:15:44,970 --> 02:15:47,520
uh,
assistance in some fashion.

3433
02:15:47,550 --> 02:15:49,620
I don't know who right or whatever,
but I just,

3434
02:15:49,800 --> 02:15:53,610
that's the one that more than than any,
any others that I've looked at,

3435
02:15:54,420 --> 02:15:56,940
you know,
makes me step back and go,

3436
02:15:56,941 --> 02:15:57,450
no,
we don't,

3437
02:15:57,450 --> 02:15:58,710
we don't know the whole story here.

3438
02:15:59,010 --> 02:16:00,060
Um,
the Kennedy thing,

3439
02:16:00,100 --> 02:16:01,200
I,
you know,

3440
02:16:01,380 --> 02:16:02,213
again,
maybe there's something out there that 

3441
02:16:02,851 --> 02:16:06,090
we just haven't turned over a,
that's always a possibility.

3442
02:16:06,091 --> 02:16:06,980
But,
um,

3443
02:16:07,260 --> 02:16:09,360
yeah,
mlk I think is a,

3444
02:16:09,361 --> 02:16:11,490
is that's the one that's most 
disturbing.

3445
02:16:11,520 --> 02:16:12,353
That's interesting.
I don't know enough about the mlk 

3446
02:16:13,921 --> 02:16:16,020
murder.
I need to go look into that now.

3447
02:16:16,021 --> 02:16:18,600
Especially if you think that something 
was going on.

3448
02:16:18,660 --> 02:16:21,030
Look at his behavior.
Um,

3449
02:16:21,750 --> 02:16:24,230
what the hell was his name again?
James Earl.

3450
02:16:24,231 --> 02:16:25,210
Ray.
James Earl Ray and I,

3451
02:16:25,220 --> 02:16:27,780
I've talked to his brother.
I've interviewed his brother,

3452
02:16:28,140 --> 02:16:29,800
um,
for what,

3453
02:16:30,370 --> 02:16:31,600
uh,
for a show,

3454
02:16:31,890 --> 02:16:34,340
a series where we did a,
uh,

3455
02:16:34,390 --> 02:16:35,140
kind of,
uh,

3456
02:16:35,140 --> 02:16:37,430
investigative look into this.
Um,

3457
02:16:37,690 --> 02:16:40,030
and,
um,

3458
02:16:41,080 --> 02:16:43,060
I,
there is,

3459
02:16:43,210 --> 02:16:43,680
if you,
if,

3460
02:16:43,680 --> 02:16:45,220
if,
if all you do when you're,

3461
02:16:45,221 --> 02:16:46,054
when you're looking at this is to look 
at Ray's behavior in that year leading 

3462
02:16:51,281 --> 02:16:53,740
up to the assassination.
Um,

3463
02:16:54,880 --> 02:16:56,950
that's the,
that's the interesting for me,

3464
02:16:56,951 --> 02:16:57,970
that's the most interesting part.

3465
02:16:57,970 --> 02:16:59,530
I mean,
put it in context with everything he did

3466
02:16:59,531 --> 02:17:00,490
up until that point,
which was,

3467
02:17:00,491 --> 02:17:01,450
he was basically,
again,

3468
02:17:01,451 --> 02:17:02,284
just a two big criminal,
couldn't stay out of jail and then you 

3469
02:17:05,321 --> 02:17:06,154
get this and you get this change in 
behavior and this change in the parents 

3470
02:17:08,441 --> 02:17:08,981
in this,
you know,

3471
02:17:08,981 --> 02:17:10,710
sudden ability to,
you know,

3472
02:17:11,080 --> 02:17:11,913
be,
uh,

3473
02:17:12,100 --> 02:17:13,870
something that he wasn't up until that 
point,

3474
02:17:14,080 --> 02:17:15,610
I guess everybody can change.
But that was,

3475
02:17:15,640 --> 02:17:18,460
that was the most striking part for me.
Um,

3476
02:17:19,190 --> 02:17:21,850
there's no obvious source of income?
No,

3477
02:17:22,270 --> 02:17:22,871
no,
just,

3478
02:17:22,871 --> 02:17:23,704
just,
uh,

3479
02:17:24,670 --> 02:17:25,241
just to,
you know,

3480
02:17:25,241 --> 02:17:26,380
just again,
just a penny.

3481
02:17:26,381 --> 02:17:27,850
Any criminal basically.
And,

3482
02:17:28,040 --> 02:17:30,100
um,
there was plenty of information.

3483
02:17:30,101 --> 02:17:32,470
It wasn't like he couldn't have gathered
if you say,

3484
02:17:32,471 --> 02:17:32,771
well,
no,

3485
02:17:32,771 --> 02:17:33,790
he acted on his own.
Well,

3486
02:17:33,791 --> 02:17:34,690
okay.
Yeah.

3487
02:17:34,691 --> 02:17:35,870
Was there information?
Ah,

3488
02:17:35,871 --> 02:17:36,704
yes.
The leading right up until the day 

3489
02:17:38,320 --> 02:17:39,270
before there was talk about,
oh,

3490
02:17:39,290 --> 02:17:40,123
you know,
there were news reports showing a king 

3491
02:17:41,501 --> 02:17:43,360
at the Lorraine Motel.
Um,

3492
02:17:43,361 --> 02:17:45,520
and you know,
coming in and out of the room,

3493
02:17:45,580 --> 02:17:46,413
you know,
that he was staying in and so it wasn't 

3494
02:17:49,391 --> 02:17:49,961
as if,
you know,

3495
02:17:49,961 --> 02:17:51,970
you couldn't gather that information on 
your own,

3496
02:17:52,060 --> 02:17:53,920
you know,
but it was again,

3497
02:17:53,921 --> 02:17:57,310
it was that behavior leading up to it.
And I'm not a conspiracy guy at all.

3498
02:17:57,340 --> 02:17:59,140
Right.
I've seen too much shit to,

3499
02:17:59,950 --> 02:18:00,783
you know,
to think that,

3500
02:18:00,940 --> 02:18:02,890
you know,
every conspiracy home water.

3501
02:18:02,891 --> 02:18:03,880
So,
um,

3502
02:18:03,940 --> 02:18:06,370
but this one,
it was disturbing in that regard.

3503
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:07,833
What that's worth,

3504
02:18:08,410 --> 02:18:10,170
right?
Yeah.

3505
02:18:10,200 --> 02:18:11,760
You should look into it and we'll talk 
about next time.

3506
02:18:11,761 --> 02:18:12,540
See what you think.
Cause I,

3507
02:18:12,540 --> 02:18:13,950
I'd really be interested in,
I think,

3508
02:18:14,220 --> 02:18:17,340
I don't think we're going to this show 
that we're gonna get ready to do here.

3509
02:18:17,370 --> 02:18:20,760
Start filming in next month is not going
to be looking into things like that.

3510
02:18:21,460 --> 02:18:22,620
What is it?
What is it called?

3511
02:18:22,621 --> 02:18:23,454
It's got to be called black files.
They may change the number or the name 

3512
02:18:25,561 --> 02:18:27,210
just before we go on there.
But um,

3513
02:18:27,390 --> 02:18:29,580
you know,
I really enjoyed the shows that I did in

3514
02:18:29,581 --> 02:18:31,190
the past.
American declassified with the,

3515
02:18:31,200 --> 02:18:31,860
they're looking into

3516
02:18:31,860 --> 02:18:33,630
conspiracies.
I've really enjoyed it.

3517
02:18:34,050 --> 02:18:38,640
I really thought it was fascinating and 
I get why people feel that way.

3518
02:18:38,890 --> 02:18:39,723
Yeah.
Kennedy for sure when they're on the 

3519
02:18:41,111 --> 02:18:42,240
outside.
The Kennedy wanted,

3520
02:18:42,241 --> 02:18:44,110
to me the bullet is the most disturbing 
thing.

3521
02:18:44,140 --> 02:18:44,973
Yeah,
the pool would that just showed up on 

3522
02:18:45,701 --> 02:18:47,830
Connolly's Gurney.
Oh look where we found.

3523
02:18:47,831 --> 02:18:48,664
We found this spot and it's not 
distorted and supposedly went through 

3524
02:18:51,431 --> 02:18:53,890
two people and shattered bone.
That magic bullet.

3525
02:18:54,010 --> 02:18:56,420
The magic bullet yet it's just,
I don't buy it.

3526
02:18:56,421 --> 02:18:58,120
And I don't think that that bullet came 
from there.

3527
02:18:58,150 --> 02:19:00,690
That's probably the most of all things.
So cause we looked at the,

3528
02:19:00,691 --> 02:19:01,524
the grassy knoll issue and the 
possibility of spot hitting other kids 

3529
02:19:03,330 --> 02:19:04,330
from the other side.
Yeah.

3530
02:19:04,510 --> 02:19:05,343
The fuck out of here.
I've got bullet doesn't pull it drives 

3531
02:19:07,181 --> 02:19:08,014
me crazy.
It does that there's more pieces of the 

3532
02:19:09,551 --> 02:19:10,384
bullet fragments in connally's body.
When you look at the look at the x rays 

3533
02:19:13,181 --> 02:19:15,400
of Conley's bodies that show bullet 
fragments,

3534
02:19:15,580 --> 02:19:18,610
there's little pieces,
they found a little tiny pieces of metal

3535
02:19:18,611 --> 02:19:20,510
in his body from the bullet fragments.
Huh.

3536
02:19:20,680 --> 02:19:22,510
But you don't see that missing from the 
bullet.

3537
02:19:22,511 --> 02:19:23,830
It's bullshit.
Yeah.

3538
02:19:23,831 --> 02:19:24,820
The bullet,
the bullet thing is,

3539
02:19:24,821 --> 02:19:25,810
is,
and,

3540
02:19:25,811 --> 02:19:27,410
and I,
you know,

3541
02:19:27,411 --> 02:19:27,951
again,
there's,

3542
02:19:27,951 --> 02:19:28,310
there's

3543
02:19:28,310 --> 02:19:33,310
elements of it that you look at,
but collectively I just,

3544
02:19:34,100 --> 02:19:35,060
you know,
and again,

3545
02:19:35,061 --> 02:19:35,894
maybe there's something else out there.
Maybe there is and we just haven't 

3546
02:19:38,091 --> 02:19:40,520
uncovered it or maybe this will prompt,
you know,

3547
02:19:40,550 --> 02:19:41,840
some additional information.
Who knows?

3548
02:19:41,841 --> 02:19:42,930
But,
um,

3549
02:19:43,450 --> 02:19:44,780
yeah.
Anyway,

3550
02:19:44,781 --> 02:19:46,190
it's,
it's fascinating shit.

3551
02:19:46,191 --> 02:19:48,340
But uh,
I do get it because it's so,

3552
02:19:48,390 --> 02:19:50,330
it was such a seminal moment.
Right.

3553
02:19:50,570 --> 02:19:52,880
And nobody wants to think that something
that bad,

3554
02:19:52,881 --> 02:19:53,714
that horrific.
And that's something that could sort of 

3555
02:19:54,861 --> 02:19:57,530
shatter the country in that fashion.
It could be done by one,

3556
02:19:57,770 --> 02:20:00,860
one guy,
Mike Lee Harvey Oswald or John Hinckley.

3557
02:20:01,670 --> 02:20:02,450
Hinckley.
Yeah,

3558
02:20:02,450 --> 02:20:03,283
yeah,
exactly.

3559
02:20:03,490 --> 02:20:05,360
We just let him out.
Yeah.

3560
02:20:06,560 --> 02:20:07,393
Not for good,
right?

3561
02:20:07,400 --> 02:20:08,233
Not for good.
I think it was on a release program of 

3562
02:20:10,550 --> 02:20:14,450
Fuck Outta here for life.
Get the fuck outta here forever.

3563
02:20:14,630 --> 02:20:15,463
I don't care how,
how well you've been behaving for 20 

3564
02:20:18,321 --> 02:20:18,680
years.

3565
02:20:18,680 --> 02:20:20,350
We've been locked up in a mental,
Simon,

3566
02:20:20,360 --> 02:20:22,640
he shot the president.
Get the fuck Outta here.

3567
02:20:22,670 --> 02:20:25,070
It's like what is wrong with people?
Yeah.

3568
02:20:25,130 --> 02:20:25,930
I,
it's,

3569
02:20:25,930 --> 02:20:27,910
it's that whole idea.
He's done his time.

3570
02:20:27,920 --> 02:20:28,700
He's done this time.
Yeah.

3571
02:20:28,700 --> 02:20:29,391
He's,
he's been,

3572
02:20:29,391 --> 02:20:31,820
uh,
he's been rehabilitated.

3573
02:20:31,880 --> 02:20:32,511
And,
uh,

3574
02:20:32,511 --> 02:20:35,510
and that's always that argument.
Is Prison for incarceration or is it for

3575
02:20:35,511 --> 02:20:37,160
rehabilitation?
As for us,

3576
02:20:37,460 --> 02:20:38,780
for us,
shot the president.

3577
02:20:38,810 --> 02:20:40,160
Get in the cage.
Hey,

3578
02:20:40,161 --> 02:20:41,060
can I say one thing?
Yes,

3579
02:20:41,061 --> 02:20:41,570
please.
Oh,

3580
02:20:41,570 --> 02:20:42,750
we finished up,
uh,

3581
02:20:43,100 --> 02:20:44,320
uh,
this is sort of a,

3582
02:20:44,800 --> 02:20:47,090
a bump for a buddy of mine who's in 
Boise,

3583
02:20:47,120 --> 02:20:47,953
just wrote his first book.
If anybody's out there and they're 

3584
02:20:50,130 --> 02:20:52,280
looking for a book to read.
Um,

3585
02:20:52,730 --> 02:20:56,000
uh,
his name is andrew cousins and,

3586
02:20:56,030 --> 02:20:59,030
uh,
he's a former operator who,

3587
02:20:59,810 --> 02:21:00,643
you know,
knows his shit and it's his first 

3588
02:21:03,231 --> 02:21:04,064
attempt at a fiction novel.
It's called a failed state and it's set 

3589
02:21:08,301 --> 02:21:12,410
in Afghanistan and also here in the U S 
and a couple of other places,

3590
02:21:12,411 --> 02:21:14,030
Turkey and Germany and elsewhere.
Uh,

3591
02:21:14,031 --> 02:21:16,550
interesting rate.
A lot of technical information in there.

3592
02:21:16,551 --> 02:21:17,540
It's a,
it's a fiction novel,

3593
02:21:17,541 --> 02:21:20,270
but he's dumped a lot of information in 
there,

3594
02:21:20,271 --> 02:21:21,830
so it's clear he knows what he's talking
about,

3595
02:21:22,610 --> 02:21:23,371
but it's worth,
it's,

3596
02:21:23,371 --> 02:21:24,530
it's,
it's worth a peak.

3597
02:21:24,531 --> 02:21:25,790
If anybody's looking for something to 
read,

3598

just you looking out for his buddy.

02:21:28,790 --> 02:21:29,480
