1
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:02,910
Her low freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:03,440
So,

3
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:04,590
so the reason I,

4
00:00:04,591 --> 00:00:08,850
the reason I think a guy like that gets
that good especially so quick is because

5
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:11,430
he doesn't have a favorite part.

6
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:12,540
He doesn't like,

7
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:13,860
he loves the whole thing,

8
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:14,641
you know,

9
00:00:14,641 --> 00:00:14,971
you know,

10
00:00:14,971 --> 00:00:18,480
you know those guys that they're
good strikers and they love striking.

11
00:00:18,481 --> 00:00:20,370
So that's what they
want to do all the time.

12
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:21,151
Like,

13
00:00:21,151 --> 00:00:21,301
no,

14
00:00:21,301 --> 00:00:25,620
he works in everything because for his
offense to be as good and as defense to

15
00:00:25,621 --> 00:00:26,760
be just as good.

16
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:29,280
A lot of guys just want to be offensive.

17
00:00:29,281 --> 00:00:30,630
Guys just want to win in the gym.

18
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:33,330
Guys want to get on top and they want
to stay there and they want to control.

19
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:35,820
So when those guys get put on their back,

20
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:39,570
they don't really know what to do or
they have a much harder time escaping or

21
00:00:39,571 --> 00:00:41,040
transitioning out of that position.

22
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,630
But not a guy like that though.

23
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,020
Those are the best guys in the world.

24
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:45,511
You look at,

25
00:00:45,511 --> 00:00:46,530
you look at Dj,

26
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,430
you look at dom,

27
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:48,810
I mean even Connor,

28
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:49,710
right?

29
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:50,543
Um,

30
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:54,510
the Nate fight is a bad example because
that was the first time he was in a

31
00:00:54,511 --> 00:00:55,850
fight in the UFC and,

32
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:57,900
and he didn't like it the
second time he did better.

33
00:00:57,901 --> 00:00:59,100
But at the same thing with Chad,

34
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,120
the little bit of a fight he was in
with Mendez when he was on his back,

35
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,260
he did some work,

36
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:05,520
got back to his feet.

37
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:06,090
He didn't,

38
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:08,810
he wasn't so uncomfortable with a,

39
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:12,780
with a dominant wrestler like that on top
that he wasn't going to be able to get

40
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:13,614
back up.

41
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:14,940
Yeah.

42
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:15,330
Well,

43
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:16,180
Connor is,

44
00:01:16,181 --> 00:01:17,670
is definitely evolving.

45
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:18,240
You know,

46
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,860
you could definitely tell that he's,

47
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:20,510
uh,

48
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:23,820
like especially his approach
to the second Nate Diaz fight.

49
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:28,950
He fought that fight very smart and he
survived some moments where it looks like

50
00:01:28,951 --> 00:01:29,784
he was gassing out,

51
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:32,220
or at least he got that
opportunity to reset.

52
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:33,270
If he wasn't gassing out,

53
00:01:33,271 --> 00:01:34,350
it's definitely diminished.

54
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:35,580
But he managed it.

55
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:38,850
He managed it much better than
the first time because I mean,

56
00:01:38,851 --> 00:01:40,830
when he got in trouble the first time,

57
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:43,110
he did try to change the game,

58
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:45,660
but when it wasn't in his favor,

59
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:46,411
it was like,

60
00:01:46,411 --> 00:01:47,510
I kind of want Outta here.

61
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:48,390
[inaudible] spirit.

62
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:48,841
I mean,

63
00:01:48,841 --> 00:01:49,471
as a fighter,

64
00:01:49,471 --> 00:01:50,490
I look at that and I'm like,

65
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:52,350
his spirit kind of broke there.

66
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,490
But he asked for that fight again and
then he did it again and he did run into

67
00:01:56,491 --> 00:02:00,600
some trouble and he improved
and he fought through it.

68
00:02:00,601 --> 00:02:02,070
The second time he didn't,

69
00:02:02,071 --> 00:02:02,821
he wasn't like,

70
00:02:02,821 --> 00:02:02,941
oh,

71
00:02:02,941 --> 00:02:03,900
this is a real fight.

72
00:02:03,901 --> 00:02:05,550
Now I gotta get Outta here.

73
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:05,821
No,

74
00:02:05,821 --> 00:02:06,331
he was like,

75
00:02:06,331 --> 00:02:07,320
I'm staying right here.

76
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:12,450
So I'm excited to see that Conor
fight Eddie because I mean,

77
00:02:12,451 --> 00:02:13,284
yeah,

78
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,300
Nate is the same kind of guy.

79
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:17,550
He's not going to worry
about those kinds of things.

80
00:02:17,551 --> 00:02:20,540
But like Eddie is a different beast.

81
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:21,720
Eddie's that Philly beast.

82
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,680
He's a savage.

83
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:23,971
So I want to see,

84
00:02:23,971 --> 00:02:25,530
I want to see them get into a fight,

85
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,860
like not that it could easily happen
to and we could easily happen.

86
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:30,331
Eddie Abras,

87
00:02:30,331 --> 00:02:31,260
the fucking savage,

88
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:32,663
he really is.

89
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:34,890
He watched that Rafael dos Anjos stoppage.

90
00:02:34,891 --> 00:02:36,210
Holy Shit.

91
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:37,591
The combination,

92
00:02:37,591 --> 00:02:38,424
he hit him worth,

93
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:39,001
I mean,

94
00:02:39,001 --> 00:02:39,441
and the,

95
00:02:39,441 --> 00:02:39,870
the,

96
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:40,440
the,

97
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:45,120
the sheer amount of punches he through
the barrage that it took to put them

98
00:02:45,121 --> 00:02:45,954
away.

99
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:51,230
I mean he had some fucking serious
endurance to press the pace like that.

100
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:54,660
That's the one thing that
Connor has been struggling with,

101
00:02:54,661 --> 00:02:55,220
right?

102
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:56,020
Yeah.

103
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:56,340
Yeah.

104
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:01,340
Would that pace and insurance and Eddie
has the power to put that pace on him

105
00:03:02,051 --> 00:03:02,231
when,

106
00:03:02,231 --> 00:03:05,470
when Nate gets him tired or
it gets him hurt on his feet,

107
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,560
he's got that power is not as dynamic.

108
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:09,220
He's,

109
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:11,140
he's a very strong guy too.

110
00:03:11,141 --> 00:03:15,660
Like he's a very strong guy for one
55 I'm looking forward to that too.

111
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:15,840
Yeah.

112
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,000
I'm,

113
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,870
I'm curious actually to see what
Connor looks like at 55 because right.

114
00:03:19,871 --> 00:03:21,850
We haven't seen him there in the UFC.

115
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:23,950
We've seen 45 and then
you've seen him cut?

116
00:03:23,951 --> 00:03:28,030
No wait and wait like one 69 I
think he weighed against Nate.

117
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:30,910
It would be interesting to see,

118
00:03:30,911 --> 00:03:33,460
what does Connor look
like when he's at one 55?

119
00:03:33,461 --> 00:03:33,671
I mean,

120
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:35,230
that might be the perfect weight for him.

121
00:03:35,231 --> 00:03:36,670
It's entirely possible.

122
00:03:36,671 --> 00:03:39,010
We might see a better McGregor at one 55.

123
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:41,470
I think that's the deepest division.

124
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:41,870
Yeah.

125
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:42,250
Um,

126
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:45,820
I think it has been for the
longest time and that if,

127
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:46,091
if,

128
00:03:46,091 --> 00:03:48,310
if anybody dominates that division,

129
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:50,020
like Rda did it for a little,

130
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:51,730
he looked dominant for a little bit.

131
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,570
Um,

132
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:54,160
even coming up to the title fight,

133
00:03:54,161 --> 00:03:56,620
he looked like he was going
to hold onto that for a while.

134
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,060
Um,

135
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:01,090
but everybody there so
close everybody that way.

136
00:04:01,091 --> 00:04:02,110
Class is so close.

137
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:04,120
So if somebody does it,

138
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:05,031
but what about neuroma?

139
00:04:05,031 --> 00:04:09,310
Grumet off because he ragdolled
everybody he's gotten in there with.

140
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:12,610
That's the one guy you can't say it's
close with because everybody he's got

141
00:04:12,611 --> 00:04:13,001
ahold of,

142
00:04:13,001 --> 00:04:17,680
he's beating the fuck out of that guy
is special no matter if it's special.

143
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:18,573
That's true.

144
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:19,570
I like,

145
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,690
I like that guy because what you said,

146
00:04:22,691 --> 00:04:23,380
he's special.

147
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:23,680
Right?

148
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,600
And when you see that special thing,

149
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:30,670
then I guess people kind of get lost in
the void when everybody's close to being

150
00:04:30,671 --> 00:04:31,930
just as good as each other.

151
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:35,170
Then you kind of just fight to get just
a little bit better than the other guy,

152
00:04:35,171 --> 00:04:36,460
just a little bit better than the other.

153
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:37,690
I just gotta be better than him.

154
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:41,740
But then when you get the John Jones
that comes into the arena and he's,

155
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:44,590
she's leaps and bounds
ahead of everybody else,

156
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:48,250
then you realize there's a bigger
gap and guys start closing that.

157
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,060
Right?

158
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,530
Like a Alyse Alinka,

159
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:51,730
Alexandra Gusterson.

160
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:52,623
I mean,

161
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,490
he always fights at that level,

162
00:04:54,491 --> 00:04:55,840
especially when he's in a title fight.

163
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:57,670
But I don't know if,

164
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,740
if John Jones didn't exist,

165
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:01,870
if he would rise to that occasion,

166
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,520
what I mean eat.

167
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:04,871
So,

168
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:08,830
so somebody's got to show up
in the lightweight division
at some point like that

169
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:09,461
too,

170
00:05:09,461 --> 00:05:11,950
to make people raise their level.

171
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:13,480
Because guys right now,

172
00:05:13,481 --> 00:05:15,520
which is the deepest
and toughest division,

173
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:19,300
but guys are so close and maybe
no Maga Madoff is that guy.

174
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:20,373
Hmm.

175
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,071
Well,

176
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:23,560
he certainly has been in
when it comes to grappling,

177
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:26,050
like what he did to dos Anjos was,

178
00:05:26,051 --> 00:05:27,100
was pretty stunning,

179
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:27,941
you know,

180
00:05:27,941 --> 00:05:28,511
because there was like,

181
00:05:28,511 --> 00:05:31,870
man though Santos is a legit
Brazilian Jiu Jitsu black belt,

182
00:05:31,871 --> 00:05:33,100
super strong guy,

183
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:36,450
really good on the ground and it
just seemed like [inaudible] off.

184
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:39,030
Just got ahold of them and just did
whatever the fuck you wanted to.

185
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,030
Once you've got them on the ground,

186
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,620
just throws dudes around.

187
00:05:41,621 --> 00:05:43,120
It's almost like he's built different,

188
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:44,373
but he doesn't,

189
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:44,651
you know,

190
00:05:44,651 --> 00:05:47,470
like if Gleason bow was
doing that to dude's,

191
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,071
I'd go,

192
00:05:48,071 --> 00:05:49,150
I that makes sense.

193
00:05:49,151 --> 00:05:50,200
Look at that fucking guy.

194
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:51,910
But when Norma Madoff does it,

195
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:56,410
it's not necessarily just some
overwhelming physical attribute.

196
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:59,030
It's his technique and his aggression.

197
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:04,040
Just just super fucking aggressive
and tight with his grappling in his

198
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:04,671
positioning,

199
00:06:04,671 --> 00:06:06,590
his ground and pound as horrific.

200
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,120
He's a scary dude,

201
00:06:08,121 --> 00:06:08,954
man.

202
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:10,041
He doesn't,

203
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:12,770
he doesn't even have to think
about the way he does those moves.

204
00:06:12,771 --> 00:06:16,070
I remember when you said that and
when you say ragdoll on people in Rda,

205
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:21,200
Rda took that shot on him and he was
in the third and he hit him with it.

206
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:25,730
Uchi Mata basically right from the over
Hook whizzer and tripped him forcing it

207
00:06:25,731 --> 00:06:27,140
and that's not easy.

208
00:06:27,141 --> 00:06:29,210
Throw it a hit and
especially from that range,

209
00:06:29,211 --> 00:06:30,710
it didn't look like it
was going to happen,

210
00:06:30,711 --> 00:06:35,150
but he does it to the guy who goes on and
become the world champion that way and

211
00:06:35,151 --> 00:06:37,130
then dominate other guys
at that weight class.

212
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:37,971
Yeah,

213
00:06:37,971 --> 00:06:39,320
like that guy is special man.

214
00:06:39,321 --> 00:06:39,951
I want to see,

215
00:06:39,951 --> 00:06:43,490
I want to see him improve his standup
and get and get and just get better.

216
00:06:43,491 --> 00:06:45,530
I want to see him do things like Dj is,

217
00:06:45,531 --> 00:06:45,771
you know,

218
00:06:45,771 --> 00:06:49,400
just working on his weaknesses and cause,

219
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:51,920
I mean that guy would never lose.

220
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:57,120
Imagine if he had Djs,

221
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:59,480
MMA Iq and skillset,

222
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:01,670
but his rest with his red.

223
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:05,120
What is wrestling and ground is
now like who's beating that guy?

224
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,180
I would send that guy
to fight wars for me.

225
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:11,361
Yeah,

226
00:07:11,361 --> 00:07:11,780
man,

227
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:12,081
look,

228
00:07:12,081 --> 00:07:12,471
he's,

229
00:07:12,471 --> 00:07:15,790
he rocked dolls dudes in a
very unusual way and deal.

230
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,470
Every now and then a guy will come
up like that that can do that.

231
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:21,260
And he does it with
intensity and aggression.

232
00:07:21,261 --> 00:07:22,970
Like Damien Maia,

233
00:07:22,971 --> 00:07:23,601
rag dolls,

234
00:07:23,601 --> 00:07:24,620
a lot of people too,

235
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:25,910
especially lately,

236
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:28,700
he gets ahold of guys like
I did with Rick story,

237
00:07:28,701 --> 00:07:31,880
but he's doing it in like
this technical squeezy way.

238
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:34,910
You know when Norma grow
off gets a hold of dudes.

239
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:36,260
It's smash.

240
00:07:36,261 --> 00:07:37,700
Everything is smash.

241
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:39,660
He's driving you into the ground,

242
00:07:39,661 --> 00:07:42,530
smashing you into the ground that's
smashing when you're on top of you.

243
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:45,080
Damien Maia is just constricting.

244
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:49,480
He's like moving into position and he
slowly closing you off and he's gonna

245
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:50,323
choke you.

246
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,490
It's a totally different
kind of domination.

247
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:54,163
But then,

248
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:58,400
I don't know if it's entirely the fairest
comparison cause Damien is obviously

249
00:07:58,401 --> 00:08:02,030
far a much longer career and he
fought at one 85 and he fought again.

250
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:02,150
Yeah,

251
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:03,320
it's against Anderson.

252
00:08:03,321 --> 00:08:04,430
He got knocked out by Nate.

253
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,320
He's had a lot of ups and downs in
the UFC and Jake shields beat him.

254
00:08:09,321 --> 00:08:10,160
People forget that.

255
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:12,020
Jake shields essentially
out grappled them.

256
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,140
But number coming off.

257
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:15,740
Good luck.

258
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:16,371
Good luck out.

259
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:17,300
Grapple on that dude.

260
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,553
Good luck.

261
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:20,421
But what's his,

262
00:08:20,421 --> 00:08:21,141
what does it take down?

263
00:08:21,141 --> 00:08:22,130
Percentage like two.

264
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:23,840
It's probably a million percent.

265
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:25,611
I mean,

266
00:08:25,611 --> 00:08:26,660
he takes down everybody.

267
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:29,330
But the other thing about
number Grumet off is um,

268
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:29,931
uh,

269
00:08:29,931 --> 00:08:33,410
then he gets injured a lot
and you've got to wonder,

270
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,880
is it because of that insane
fucking aggressive style of his,

271
00:08:37,881 --> 00:08:38,530
it's so,

272
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:40,070
it makes it so fun to watch him.

273
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:43,790
He's that like you're kind of
red lining your body too much

274
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:46,183
probably.

275
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:46,841
Yeah.

276
00:08:46,841 --> 00:08:47,240
Right.

277
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,073
Yeah.

278
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:48,861
Yeah.

279
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:49,101
I mean,

280
00:08:49,101 --> 00:08:49,850
you got arrest,

281
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:50,270
right?

282
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:51,230
You gotta heal up.

283
00:08:51,231 --> 00:08:52,700
You can't always be on.

284
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:53,691
Yeah.

285
00:08:53,691 --> 00:08:54,620
But I mean,

286
00:08:54,621 --> 00:08:58,530
can a guide like a Damien Maia
who trains very technically,

287
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,190
I mean obviously he wrestles and he
does like a lot of chaotic movements as

288
00:09:02,191 --> 00:09:02,461
well,

289
00:09:02,461 --> 00:09:05,400
but probably not nearly
what the kind of intensity,

290
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:07,080
the number of men off does.

291
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,340
You gotta wonder like a,

292
00:09:09,341 --> 00:09:14,341
that style is obviously super effective
and very fucking devastating and fun to

293
00:09:14,431 --> 00:09:15,240
watch.

294
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:20,010
But I wonder if preparing for that style
and executing that style is almost like

295
00:09:20,011 --> 00:09:21,930
ultimately too much on your joints,

296
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:23,250
too much on your body.

297
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I guess the question would be then is
can he be no Magna Madoff without that

298
00:09:31,741 --> 00:09:32,574
style?

299
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:36,540
Does he have the skill to translate
that to slowing it down and,

300
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:37,230
and,

301
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:38,510
and turning the volume down?

302
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:48,340
Yeah.
