1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:01,900
Doom,
doom,

2
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:04,270
uh,
data.

3
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:09,280
Um,
and we're live Josh steps I didn't even 

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:09,280
notice.
And then I took a sip of coffee and then

5
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,630
my mouth was full of coffee.
Perfect timing.

6
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:12,000
Realize.
All right dude.

7
00:00:12,001 --> 00:00:14,070
Should have had a count down to five or 
something instead of three.

8
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:19,100
What?
Jamie was doing this thing with his 

9
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:19,100
fingers.
Yeah,

10
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:19,100
he was.
I saw him over there,

11
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:21,831
out of the periphery of the corner of my
eye and I wasn't sure what he was 

12
00:00:21,831 --> 00:00:21,831
dealing with it a countdown.
Was it a wave?

13
00:00:21,831 --> 00:00:22,410
Gang signs.
Gang signs.

14
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:26,010
That's his gang.
Fucking james and Jay are gang throws up

15
00:00:26,011 --> 00:00:26,730
the three,
two,

16
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:27,960
one.
Will you teach me after the show?

17
00:00:27,961 --> 00:00:30,300
Jamie?
Some of the signs after the show.

18
00:00:30,301 --> 00:00:31,560
You can even talk about it.
Dude.

19
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,000
Sorry to keep on the DL.
First rule of jre gang.

20
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:38,640
You got talk about January.
Perfect.

21
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,020
Time to have you in the fucking world is
literally about to go crazy.

22
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:46,110
What's going on?
About two to half.

23
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:48,240
It's just the bubbling.
I think we,

24
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:53,280
we think it has,
but here we are and this wonderful 

25
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,120
office park in the valley in California.
Everything's fine.

26
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:55,920
Go outside,
there's birds chirping,

27
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:58,380
so the whole world hasn't gone crazy.
It's true,

28
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:01,410
but there's spots that are going fucking
crazy.

29
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:03,980
Yale has gone crazy and pay attention to
that.

30
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:07,380
The students did my whole show up at it 
last week on my new podcast.

31
00:01:07,381 --> 00:01:10,670
Which way can I do an episode on Josh 
Jumps?

32
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:12,300
Podcast,
cozy called Hashtag.

33
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:17,390
We'd have people live if you live.
He's like down with the hip social 

34
00:01:18,871 --> 00:01:20,450
future.
You gotta get with it.

35
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:24,400
I do hashtags or something.
I only use like in jest,

36
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:27,360
you know?
Well this is sort of tongue in cheek.

37
00:01:27,361 --> 00:01:30,480
It's also a cool way of like if people 
have searched for you,

38
00:01:30,481 --> 00:01:33,000
that's probably a bazillion way that 
people lives podcasts,

39
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:34,590
but there's only one that's going to 
start with a Hashtag.

40
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:37,020
So you put it in a Hashtag and as well.
Prison will be the first to come up.

41
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,830
I use it for the UFC only like Hashtag 
UFC 91 93.

42
00:01:40,831 --> 00:01:42,680
If I'm talking about like an event.
Yeah,

43
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:47,700
do that.
But hashtags are interesting because if 

44
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:50,001
you ever go to Hashtags,
you ever go to like Hashtag black 

45
00:01:50,001 --> 00:01:50,001
twitter?
Yeah.

46
00:01:50,001 --> 00:01:50,001
I never do it.
Jesus,

47
00:01:50,001 --> 00:01:52,430
it's,
it's made.

48
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:56,990
That's where he spends 23 hours a day.
Well,

49
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
you know how sometimes sometimes you 
don't need to go to them because they 

50
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,000
come to you,
but can you say something?

51
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,410
Then you get taken out of context.
Then you can end up by some blog and 

52
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:06,930
then all of a sudden,
like all over the weekend,

53
00:02:06,931 --> 00:02:11,220
I've been getting all these tweets just 
out of the blue about what fascism is.

54
00:02:11,221 --> 00:02:11,890
I was like,
what?

55
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,400
Who are these people and why they 
tweeting at me?

56
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,400
I don't even know.
I didn't even know that I said anything 

57
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:19,400
about fascism.
Well,

58
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,221
it's because breitbart picked up 
something that I did on a segment on 

59
00:02:22,221 --> 00:02:22,221
huffpost live last week and write 
something up about it,

60
00:02:22,221 --> 00:02:24,930
about how apparently I implied that 
Donald trump was a fascist,

61
00:02:24,931 --> 00:02:27,000
which actually didn't mean because I 
don't think that he is,

62
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:32,330
but.
And all of a sudden I'm in the Hashtag 

63
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:32,820
like I'm part of the Hashtag about 
fascism without even choosing it.

64
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:37,850
I believe that most people who use the 
term fascist or fascism don't really 

65
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:40,140
exactly know what the term meant.
You're totally right,

66
00:02:40,141 --> 00:02:45,141
so let's help them out right now.
Let's find the official definition of 

67
00:02:45,141 --> 00:02:47,100
fascism because I think most people get 
it wrong.

68
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:51,840
Fascism means and authoritarian and 
nationalistic,

69
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:55,380
right wing system of government and 
social organization,

70
00:02:55,830 --> 00:03:00,760
so people use that.
There's other definitions of of course,

71
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:03,520
but extreme right wing authoritarian.

72
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:07,540
People use that for a lot of like non 
fascist reason.

73
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:12,570
That's true and I probably used it 
sloppily myself in the context in which 

74
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:13,210
bright pub was picking me up and they 
would have a point if,

75
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:15,970
if I do come across as saying that 
Donald trump is a fascist,

76
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,220
but all the people who were tweeting 
back at me with saying,

77
00:03:18,221 --> 00:03:22,060
fascism isn't right when you idiot,
it's left wing and slept way.

78
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:27,100
Socialism is the real fascism.
You don't understand the meaning of the 

79
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:30,271
word,
so I just responded with an with a link 

80
00:03:30,271 --> 00:03:32,491
to the Oxford dictionary,
which also includes the wood right wing 

81
00:03:32,491 --> 00:03:32,491
in it.
Like,

82
00:03:32,491 --> 00:03:33,610
yeah,
it's mostly considered right when we.

83
00:03:33,611 --> 00:03:38,611
When people are using it in the left 
wing circles now or about left wing 

84
00:03:38,951 --> 00:03:42,790
circles because they're using it and the
authoritarian context because that is,

85
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:48,150
I think that's applicable because a lot 
of what is going on in like really 

86
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:52,390
extreme social justice,
leftwing type organizations or groups is

87
00:03:52,391 --> 00:03:57,391
that they're trying to control behavior 
and they're trying to mitigate 

88
00:03:57,391 --> 00:04:01,021
criticism.
Like you can't criticize these concepts 

89
00:04:01,021 --> 00:04:02,890
because these concepts are supported by 
social justice.

90
00:04:02,891 --> 00:04:04,450
And um,
I've got an interesting study on that,

91
00:04:04,451 --> 00:04:07,270
but I wanted that I brought for you.
And before I get to it,

92
00:04:07,271 --> 00:04:12,271
I want,
I don't want to forget what I was just 

93
00:04:12,271 --> 00:04:13,771
thinking when you were talking about how
here we are in the valley village 

94
00:04:13,771 --> 00:04:13,771
outside.
Chirp,

95
00:04:13,771 --> 00:04:14,160
Chirp,
Chirp,

96
00:04:14,161 --> 00:04:14,710
Chirp,
Chirp,

97
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:18,280
sunshine trees.
Very good.

98
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:19,420
That's a very good.
Betty Jo.

99
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:21,510
Thank you.
Practiced that all day.

100
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:24,100
It was not a little one.
I want to hear it again.

101
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,020
I'm going to put that as my ringtone.
I do it too.

102
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:32,330
It will never hear your phone put up 
really,

103
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:33,070
really,
really loud.

104
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:38,970
So I was in Beirut briefly a few months 
ago and he was standing on the rooftop 

105
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:44,550
of this swanky hotel looking out over 
the Mediterranean and looking at 

106
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:47,410
evidence the houses and I was like,
he's just like an idyllic,

107
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:52,590
beautiful part of the world in terms of 
its natural beauty and I could 

108
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:55,300
practically swim from here to the Greek 
islands,

109
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:56,440
help people.
Ah,

110
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,440
basically,
right.

111
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:01,750
The refugees and I had just been in the 
Greek in Athens as well,

112
00:05:01,751 --> 00:05:05,800
which is like geographically,
physiologically Italy,

113
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:11,070
Greece at the same as these fucked up 
parts of North Africa and Israel and 

114
00:05:12,071 --> 00:05:15,340
Palestine and been Lebanon and not to 
mention Syria.

115
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:21,180
And I was like just struck by how 
capable we are a fucking things up as 

116
00:05:23,261 --> 00:05:25,810
paypal because the actual geography is 
the same.

117
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:29,590
Like those waves at the same waves as 
the ones on the Italian Riviera.

118
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:34,980
But the Italian Riviera is the Italian 
Riviera and this shit hole is this 

119
00:05:34,991 --> 00:05:38,080
shithole through no difference of 
climate or some old.

120
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:40,480
The booties are still there.
The booties are the same,

121
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:44,150
but religion and politics just has an 
endless capacity to,

122
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:47,170
to screw things up.
You could call it religion or politics,

123
00:05:47,171 --> 00:05:52,171
but it's really just power.
It's human beings trying to achieve 

124
00:05:52,171 --> 00:05:54,340
power and you could do it through 
whatever modality you choose,

125
00:05:54,341 --> 00:05:59,341
but the reality is it's just people that
are trying to control other people and 

126
00:05:59,341 --> 00:06:03,821
trying to gain things,
but I think it's in particular tribes 

127
00:06:03,821 --> 00:06:05,930
trying to control other tribes and 
politics and religion make you much more

128
00:06:05,931 --> 00:06:08,810
likely.
It make it much easier to be tribal,

129
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:10,970
much easier to not be an individual 
story,

130
00:06:10,971 --> 00:06:13,100
but it's sort of.
But isn't the argument against that.

131
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:18,100
What we were just talking about one in 
terms of social justice warriors and 

132
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:18,830
people calling people fascist mean that 
you're,

133
00:06:18,831 --> 00:06:19,390
you're,
you're,

134
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:24,440
you're in a tribe.
If you are on the extreme left or the 

135
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:24,440
extreme right,
you're in a tribe.

136
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,750
You know when you talk to right wing 
people,

137
00:06:26,751 --> 00:06:31,751
they're almost incapable of not bringing
up liberals or the liberals think they 

138
00:06:31,751 --> 00:06:33,710
don't just bring up their own concepts 
in their own thoughts.

139
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:37,370
They'll immediately disparage liberal 
ideas.

140
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,160
Like immediately,
you know,

141
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:39,860
they'll tell you,
well,

142
00:06:39,861 --> 00:06:40,970
you're a liberal,
you know,

143
00:06:40,971 --> 00:06:42,770
you,
you believe in this and this and that.

144
00:06:42,771 --> 00:06:46,370
So you're a liberal and then like 
immediately like downplay your ideas.

145
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:47,960
That's a tribal.
Absolutely.

146
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,630
That's politics.
It's religion as is.

147
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,740
And social justice worries will do the 
same thing.

148
00:06:51,741 --> 00:06:53,820
They'll do the same thing about.
I mean my,

149
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:54,740
you know,
the first,

150
00:06:54,741 --> 00:06:57,460
the first time I came to your attention 
was with that interview with.

151
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:00,110
So he parked the cancel Kobe activist.
Right.

152
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:05,000
And convincing still one of my favorite.
When you just broke it down to her,

153
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:07,120
you're like,
this is so fucking unbelievable.

154
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:13,870
And you could tell she was just like 
devastated that you even had the balls 

155
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:15,590
to question her to people that hadn't,
hadn't seen it,

156
00:07:15,591 --> 00:07:18,290
that she wanted to have the,
have the Kolbe a report canceled because

157
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:21,140
apparently it was racist and I did an 
interview with her on huffpost live.

158
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:26,170
Well,
it was nice for people who don't even 

159
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:30,380
know the show.
Kobe plays a character.

160
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:33,350
He plays an extreme left wing kind of 
goofy character,

161
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,090
excuse me,
extreme right wing,

162
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:39,320
kind of goofy character.
And in that context of that character,

163
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:44,470
he made a joke about racism.
It was a joke about racism and in that 

164
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:46,550
it was a funny joke.
Do you remember what the joke was?

165
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:48,260
Yeah,
I do.

166
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:49,900
It was Dan Snyder,
who,

167
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:51,930
who's the head of the Redskins,
right?

168
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:57,340
Who was saying that he.
He said that he didn't have to change 

169
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:57,410
the name of the redskins because it was 
racist.

170
00:07:57,411 --> 00:08:02,411
He was going to set up a charity for 
native American and causes and Stephen 

171
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:07,760
Colbert and his right wing persona said 
that sometimes he'd been accused of 

172
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,770
doing jokes that could be considered to 
be offensive about Asian people,

173
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:14,980
so in return he was going to set up the 
Ching Chung Dingdong Foundation for 

174
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:17,270
sensitivity towards orientals or 
whatever or whatever,

175
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:20,540
and she found that offensive.
Not really.

176
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,350
I don't believe she really did it.
I think she found it.

177
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:28,440
It was a green light for her to attack 
and to use hashtag activism and to get 

178
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:34,160
them get some publicity.
There's one story that's making the 

179
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:36,521
rounds today,
a Kansas City University professor who 

180
00:08:36,521 --> 00:08:39,760
in a class I'm about racism,
a discussion about racism and 

181
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:45,041
discrimination.
She used the word nigger and in using 

182
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:47,330
the word,
all these students are trying to get her

183
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:50,900
fired and she's been removed of her 
duties right now.

184
00:08:50,901 --> 00:08:55,100
She's been temporarily suspended under 
review or whatever their processes,

185
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:56,340
but in just saying

186
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:58,650
the word,
not saying someone is like,

187
00:08:58,651 --> 00:09:03,651
this is a word that people have issues.
Let's discuss words that people have 

188
00:09:03,651 --> 00:09:04,290
issues with.
What are the origins of these words?

189
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:05,760
Why are they problematic?
What is,

190
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,560
you know,
what can be done about this?

191
00:09:07,561 --> 00:09:09,480
I don't remember.
I'm not sure exactly what the context of

192
00:09:09,481 --> 00:09:11,070
her classes,
but they.

193
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:13,110
I'm sure it will.
I'm sure the context wasn't.

194
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:16,380
Let's go around accusing black people 
have being absolutely not.

195
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,750
Absolutely not,
but this is the same kind of thing.

196
00:09:18,751 --> 00:09:23,310
I don't believe anyone in that class was
actually hurt by that.

197
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:28,380
Well,
we sort of found the green light and 

198
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:28,380
they attacked.
Yeah.

199
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:28,830
Don't we learn what to be offended by 
it?

200
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:34,520
Yes.
So it's possible that that someone felt 

201
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,940
like an initial kind of reaction of,
oh my God,

202
00:09:35,941 --> 00:09:37,410
I just heard that word.
That's good.

203
00:09:37,411 --> 00:09:42,411
I've been told that that word is 
completely unacceptable under all 

204
00:09:42,411 --> 00:09:45,411
circumstances,
and I've been told that I'm allowed to 

205
00:09:45,411 --> 00:09:45,411
be offended.

206
00:09:45,411 --> 00:09:45,411
Yeah,
that's right.

207
00:09:45,411 --> 00:09:46,530
And in in date ought to be offended.
Yes.

208
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:51,620
And so like I was amazed by the power of
that word when I first came to the 

209
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:54,350
states because they're only here is,
it does,

210
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:59,690
do we have this demoss would the end 
would like that phrase?

211
00:10:00,151 --> 00:10:00,570
Yeah.
That's.

212
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:02,550
I mean I'd never heard that until I came
to the site.

213
00:10:02,551 --> 00:10:07,551
So in Australia it was completely 
unacceptable to ever to ever use the 

214
00:10:07,561 --> 00:10:10,140
word nigger against somebody.
You would just never do that.

215
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:13,440
I was taught since the earliest days 
that racism is terrible,

216
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,990
but you could talk about it in polite 
company.

217
00:10:15,991 --> 00:10:16,590
I mean you,
if you.

218
00:10:16,591 --> 00:10:21,591
If it came up,
you'd be able to discuss the existence 

219
00:10:21,591 --> 00:10:21,591
of the word and nobody would ever say 
the word,

220
00:10:21,591 --> 00:10:23,490
but you guys have racism towards 
aborigines.

221
00:10:23,491 --> 00:10:25,530
That's pretty.
That's pretty real over there.

222
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,780
This is towards black people,
right?

223
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:28,740
No,
that's right.

224
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:31,230
But there's this.
There is a much,

225
00:10:31,231 --> 00:10:36,231
much,
much bigger awareness of the kind of 

226
00:10:36,231 --> 00:10:40,851
tragedy of the original sin.
Of what happened when Australia was 

227
00:10:40,851 --> 00:10:42,780
settled than there is here towards 
native Americans.

228
00:10:42,781 --> 00:10:47,781
I sort of regard native Americans as 
being the people who've really been 

229
00:10:47,781 --> 00:10:47,781
screwed in this country.
I mean not to,

230
00:10:47,781 --> 00:10:50,370
not that it should be a competition of 
like who's you know,

231
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:55,490
who's suffering was worse.
So like I'll put my slavery genocide 

232
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:55,520
more,
right?

233
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:57,720
That's right.
Because I always hate it when,

234
00:10:57,770 --> 00:11:00,190
when we get into those games.
But um,

235
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,250
nobody even talks about,
like in Australia,

236
00:11:02,251 --> 00:11:04,050
if you go to an award ceremony,
for example,

237
00:11:04,051 --> 00:11:09,051
if you're at the grammys,
every single presenter will come up and 

238
00:11:09,051 --> 00:11:11,421
they will begin by saying,
I want to start by acknowledging the 

239
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:12,480
traditional owners of this land that you
had a windy people,

240
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,710
uh,
you know,

241
00:11:13,711 --> 00:11:14,190
they'll,
they'll,

242
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:17,790
they'll at least give a kind of 
politically correct nod to the fact that

243
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:21,900
we occupied the country and basically 
wiped out an entire people.

244
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:26,900
And you know,
you'll see aboriginal flags flying on 

245
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:27,510
Parliament House alongside the 
Australian flag.

246
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:32,840
What the,
I don't even know what the night of 

247
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:32,840
American flag is.
Still even have a flag.

248
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:32,840
I don't believe they did.
I mean,

249
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,350
if they did it,
I mean,

250
00:11:33,351 --> 00:11:36,220
noted aborigines back then symbols,
you know,

251
00:11:36,221 --> 00:11:41,221
they,
they certainly had symbols that were 

252
00:11:41,221 --> 00:11:41,700
indicative of different tribes or 
different regions.

253
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:42,430
But I don't,
I don't,

254
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,280
I don't think they had flags.
I could be wrong.

255
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:49,300
No,
but I mean aboriginals didn't have 

256
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:49,300
flags.
Aboriginals didn't even have metal,

257
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:49,300
so.
Yeah.

258
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:49,300
Right.
Okay.

259
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:53,841
I mean they were at the time when the 
British settled Australia and I always 

260
00:11:53,841 --> 00:11:55,420
get accused when I say things like this 
have been politically correct,

261
00:11:55,421 --> 00:11:59,080
social justice warriors of imposing onto
traditional societies.

262
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:04,350
I have an idea of human civilization as 
being better if it's like industrialized

263
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:06,520
than if it's not industrialized.

264
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,470
And because I'm like a white man who 
liked,

265
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:13,500
totally thinks that like the 21st 
century is better than the fucking 15th 

266
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:13,870
century.
Let me back up because it is better.

267
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:14,330
Yeah.
Yeah.

268
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:16,810
They have,
we have computers and the Internet,

269
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:21,990
we have books,
we have a lot of things that are better 

270
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:22,990
than like flint knives.
So let's just having said that,

271
00:12:22,991 --> 00:12:24,850
you're such a wide,
you such a white man,

272
00:12:24,851 --> 00:12:25,930
Joe.
Uh,

273
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:28,290
having said that,
if you think about like the,

274
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,890
the traditional anthropological 
conception of human evolution going from

275
00:12:32,891 --> 00:12:33,550
like the,
you know,

276
00:12:33,551 --> 00:12:38,551
the,
the discovery of fire and farming and 

277
00:12:38,551 --> 00:12:41,341
then up through the bronze age and the 
INA agents on average and he's when the,

278
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:47,420
when the British settled Australia were 
the least advanced civilization in the 

279
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:52,201
world by far.
I mean we're talking a mosque and again,

280
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:54,480
I like the politically correct.
Pardon me?

281
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,490
It has to keep qualifying.
They had been around for over 100,000

282
00:12:57,491 --> 00:12:59,020
years.
So they were doing something successful.

283
00:12:59,021 --> 00:13:01,000
Like it's only been 2000.
Jesus.

284
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:04,390
Well,
let's rabbits are doing a good job.

285
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:07,480
Did you just compare aboriginal 
Australians to rabbits?

286
00:13:07,481 --> 00:13:10,460
Did it in that context?
Okay.

287
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,710
I like,
I like,

288
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:16,890
I like you for that because I like 
analogies and I like being able to 

289
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:17,800
accept analogies without thinking that 
the person is saying that the two things

290
00:13:17,801 --> 00:13:20,590
are the same in every respect because I 
always get pulled up.

291
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:25,591
Like I made a Hitler analogy the other 
day about I was talking to who was at 

292
00:13:25,591 --> 00:13:26,500
Donny Deutsch.
Do you know that guy?

293
00:13:26,501 --> 00:13:27,790
Yes.
Um,

294
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:32,880
and uh,
he was talking about how he likes trump 

295
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:32,880
and I,
and,

296
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,330
and I might some parallel where I was 
like,

297
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:36,520
he was,
I was simply saying that like,

298
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:37,540
he was like,
he's popular,

299
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:38,500
he's touching a vein.

300
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:39,160
I was like,
yeah,

301
00:13:39,161 --> 00:13:44,161
but is that the only reason to respect 
somebody hit let's touch the vein as 

302
00:13:44,161 --> 00:13:44,161
well?
And he was like,

303
00:13:44,161 --> 00:13:46,390
he got all outraged on the air at the 
fact that I would like say Hitler.

304
00:13:46,391 --> 00:13:47,530
He was like,
you can't do that.

305
00:13:47,531 --> 00:13:48,280
Like,
how dare you.

306
00:13:48,281 --> 00:13:49,650
I'm Jewish.
And I was,

307
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:52,600
I was like,
I'm not saying that trump is the same as

308
00:13:52,601 --> 00:13:53,380
Hitler,
you idiot.

309
00:13:53,381 --> 00:13:58,381
I'm saying that saying that the 
criterion by which you were judging his 

310
00:13:58,381 --> 00:14:01,120
success is floored.
And I was using an analogy to do so.

311
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:02,020
Well,
he should be,

312
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:04,750
he should be ashamed because he's doing 
the exact thing.

313
00:14:04,751 --> 00:14:09,751
We're accusing the extreme left up.
He saw a green light and he went after 

314
00:14:09,751 --> 00:14:09,751
it.
That's right.

315
00:14:09,751 --> 00:14:14,041
And He,
does he really think I'm a Nazi 

316
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:14,041
sympathizer or that I'm like shitting on
it.

317
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:14,041
And then.
So then I was like,

318
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:18,121
Hey,
my grandmother was in the concentration 

319
00:14:18,121 --> 00:14:18,121
camps and I pull a juke out on me and 
then I just moved right up.

320
00:14:18,121 --> 00:14:19,900
Fuck yeah,
Donny.

321
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,950
So anyway,
area aborigines didn't,

322
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,130
didn't have like metal and stuff.
No,

323
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:29,160
they were,
I mean they were extremely primitive so 

324
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,381
far removed from what we consider to be 
advanced civilization that Australia 

325
00:14:32,201 --> 00:14:36,190
felt it was okay to actually take their 
children and adopt them.

326
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:38,740
And this was recent.
This was in like the fifties,

327
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:42,100
you know,
until you know,

328
00:14:42,101 --> 00:14:47,101
until 19,
69 aborigines were classified in 

329
00:14:47,101 --> 00:14:49,660
Australia as foreigner.
Whoa.

330
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:52,040
In other words,
they want

331
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:59,200
not flora,
it might've been a couple of floral 

332
00:14:59,200 --> 00:14:59,210
aborigines,
but uh,

333
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:04,240
they were mostly like in the same 
category as Kangaroos now you couldn't 

334
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:04,240
dark,
you couldn't kill him.

335
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:09,730
He couldn't know.
But I mean they weren't officially 

336
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:10,370
classified as full and it's just that 
they weren't classified as human,

337
00:15:10,371 --> 00:15:12,410
like they weren't considered to be 
people in the.

338
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:15,230
So like you can't kill a chimp either.
Yeah.

339
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:18,230
Wow.
That's a recent thing.

340
00:15:18,231 --> 00:15:21,200
But it's come a long way in the past 15,
20 years now.

341
00:15:21,201 --> 00:15:23,090
I think there's a general consensus 
that,

342
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:28,160
that we really fucked them over a hope 
so kids are fucking babies no matter.

343
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:34,470
I mean no matter how not to defend it,
but this was at the same time that Jim 

344
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:35,670
crow was going on here.
Right?

345
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:40,720
I mean it's not,
it's not like we were in a lightened 

346
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:40,720
our.
Well,

347
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:40,730
our forefathers were enlightened in the 
fifties about rice.

348
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:41,410
Yeah.
Well the,

349
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:43,070
everybody was pretty fucked up back 
then.

350
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:48,220
I think it's very difficult for us to 
understand in 2015 what it was like in 

351
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:51,380
1950 [inaudible] I think we assume that 
they should have known better.

352
00:15:51,381 --> 00:15:56,381
They should have been like us,
but 100 years before them they were 

353
00:15:56,381 --> 00:15:56,690
cowboys.
That's they.

354
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,090
They had horses riding trains and that's
it.

355
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:01,760
And 100 years before that they didn't 
even have fucking trains,

356
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:04,860
you know,
in 100 years before that mean you're,

357
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:06,260
you're in the dark ages.
Yeah.

358
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:09,260
I mean you're 1,514
hundreds,

359
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,480
a few hundred years removed from gingiss
con.

360
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:16,680
It's fast and it's like,
I don't remember whether I've spoken to 

361
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:20,621
you about this before,
but I was when I was in grace on the 

362
00:16:20,621 --> 00:16:20,621
trip and I was just talking about,
um,

363
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:22,370
I was standing at the,
you know,

364
00:16:22,371 --> 00:16:27,371
the Acropolis in Greece.
I was expecting to be wowed like Altura 

365
00:16:27,371 --> 00:16:27,980
PSA by all the Shia age of this thing.

366
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:33,010
Oh,
I'm at the birthplace of Western 

367
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:34,100
civilization.
And instead what I thought was,

368
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:37,010
I'd actually just been back to New 
Zealand because my grandma died.

369
00:16:37,011 --> 00:16:39,680
She was one day shy of her 100th 
birthday.

370
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:44,630
Damn.
Almost made it 99 and 364 days.

371
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:49,190
So she was just born premature.
She would've had that mean when you were

372
00:16:49,191 --> 00:16:50,510
born.
So arbitrary.

373
00:16:50,511 --> 00:16:52,640
I think labor,
yeah.

374
00:16:52,641 --> 00:16:55,160
That's a good way of thinking about it.
If you take her from like the,

375
00:16:55,161 --> 00:16:56,680
the third trimester.
Oh yeah.

376
00:16:56,770 --> 00:16:58,730
She made it.
She made it from the quickening.

377
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:03,970
Yes.
She made it from the yes soul made it 

378
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:07,490
100 percent.
And what I was struck by at the 

379
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:08,540
Acropolis,
the Parthenon was not like how old human

380
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:11,750
civilization was,
but it was like my grandma,

381
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:16,700
her lifetime is a manageable period of 
time in my brain.

382
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:19,880
I can think about that in a way that 
when you talk to me about something that

383
00:17:19,881 --> 00:17:20,930
happened 50,000
years ago,

384
00:17:20,931 --> 00:17:25,931
it's just meaningless.
So when you talk about the size of the 

385
00:17:25,931 --> 00:17:27,791
cosmos or a light year or something,
it doesn't like I might be able to 

386
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:27,920
understand it intellectually,
but it just washes off in my head.

387
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:30,560
I don't know what I'm talking about,
but the lifetime of my grandmother,

388
00:17:30,561 --> 00:17:32,660
that's a manageable span of time.
I can imagine.

389
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:34,080
A hundred years.
Yes.

390
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:39,160
And you know what?
This acropolis at the dawn of Western 

391
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,750
civilization,
before humans had even invented anything

392
00:17:41,751 --> 00:17:46,751
that we would recognize as being 
civilized in terms of laws and 

393
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:50,340
procedures and technologies that only 
100 of my grandma's.

394
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,050
Yeah.
Yeah.

395
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,900
How about this one?
Sorry,

396
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:56,250
it's 40 140,000
users.

397
00:17:56,251 --> 00:18:01,251
40 of my grandma's.
Jesus was 20 of my grandma's a nuclear 

398
00:18:01,251 --> 00:18:05,421
weapon.
My grandma was born during the 

399
00:18:05,421 --> 00:18:07,281
[inaudible] campaign and World War One.
Hitler wasn't even a name that her 

400
00:18:07,281 --> 00:18:10,020
parents knew when she was born.
The depression hadn't happened.

401
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:13,530
The bomb hadn't been invented,
let alone computers.

402
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:18,860
How faster things going pretty fast.
Like how recently was it over the span 

403
00:18:19,651 --> 00:18:23,550
of geological time that we would 
monkeys,

404
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:24,390
effectively,
monkeys,

405
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:28,000
they believe to 100,000
years ago.

406
00:18:28,001 --> 00:18:29,470
Human beings,
we're in this form,

407
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:33,580
they're bullied,
but it changes depending upon the fossil

408
00:18:33,581 --> 00:18:35,350
record.
Like when they add new evidence,

409
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:38,350
like they just found a.
like within the last couple of weeks,

410
00:18:38,351 --> 00:18:42,310
they've recognized a new subspecies of 
human beings and ancient subspecies.

411
00:18:42,311 --> 00:18:44,470
They found a giant tooth,
so they're.

412
00:18:44,471 --> 00:18:49,471
They're.
They're finding fossil records that 

413
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:53,100
pretty much pretty much coincide with 
the established belief that people are 

414
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:55,540
200,000
plus years in this form.

415
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:57,400
Like you could take a person from 
200,000

416
00:18:57,401 --> 00:19:02,401
years ago,
they'd probably be considerably smaller 

417
00:19:02,401 --> 00:19:04,261
than us because they didn't get a lot of
food and you'd put them in a movie 

418
00:19:04,261 --> 00:19:04,261
theater and they would look just like 
you were.

419
00:19:04,261 --> 00:19:05,710
I maybe was teeth.
Yeah,

420
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:07,060
long.
They kept your mouth shut,

421
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:08,370
you know,
we showered them,

422
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:10,630
trimmed whatever fucking weird hair they
have.

423
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:16,050
You know,
they're probably just very strangely 

424
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:16,050
Harry,
but you know,

425
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:16,810
obviously in the fossil record we're not
getting too much.

426
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:21,900
It's very rare they find skin and hair,
so they're just kind of guessing what 

427
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:24,070
they looked like on the outside,
what they believe that about 200,000

428
00:19:24,071 --> 00:19:26,980
years in this form,
give or take 100,000

429
00:19:26,981 --> 00:19:28,720
years.
So that's pretty recent.

430
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:31,860
More than what we have than take.
Yeah.

431
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:32,860
Yeah.
Not really good.

432
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:33,610
Give and take

433
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:37,000
what's most,
what's most sort of frightening to me is

434
00:19:37,001 --> 00:19:41,320
how recently technology has become as 
powerful as it is,

435
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:46,620
especially nukes and superimposing 
technology that was invented within the 

436
00:19:47,801 --> 00:19:48,910
lifetime of my dad.

437
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:51,020
Think about what we just said,
just that.

438
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,090
What's crazy?
Call it 300,000

439
00:19:53,091 --> 00:19:55,520
years ago.
3,000

440
00:19:55,521 --> 00:19:56,900
of your grandma's?
Yeah,

441
00:19:57,290 --> 00:19:58,790
that's it.
And we're monkeys.

442
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,230
Yeah.
Just 3000.

443
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:04,560
Like a good size of theater show.
Yep.

444
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:07,340
Like you go to the Chicago theater,
that's 3,700

445
00:20:07,341 --> 00:20:12,341
people.
That's a good spot to look at those 

446
00:20:12,341 --> 00:20:15,311
people in that audience.
If you get a full Chicago theater of 

447
00:20:15,311 --> 00:20:15,311
3,700
people,

448
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:20,540
if every one of them lived birth to 
death to stop and think about that.

449
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:24,190
That's fucking crazy credit,
isn't it?

450
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:26,450
That's crazy.
It's fucking crazy.

451
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:28,790
That's 300,000
years

452
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:34,670
and you don't even need to go that.
I mean you didn't even take it that far 

453
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:37,701
before the kinds of lives that people 
will live living and the kinds of 

454
00:20:37,701 --> 00:20:41,481
concerns that they had to concern 
themselves with was so parochial and 

455
00:20:41,481 --> 00:20:45,291
they knew so little.
I mean even just back to the Middle 

456
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:47,260
Ages.
I mean think about having 50 of my.

457
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:47,860
No,
sorry.

458
00:20:47,861 --> 00:20:48,250
Five

459
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:50,620
of my grandmother's get us back to the 
Middle Ages.

460
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:54,420
Five of them.
That's crazy.

461
00:20:55,090 --> 00:21:00,090
50.
Get us back to before we had before the 

462
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:00,090
Parthenon.
God,

463
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:02,680
I mean we are hairless apes who just 
just now,

464
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:07,710
just for right now,
just tap into to have discovered the 

465
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:09,570
Adam amazing technology than the theater
thing is really free.

466
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:10,810
That's a good one.
I like that.

467
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:13,150
I love that was freaking me out because 
that's monkeys.

468
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:14,770
I mean,
we go back to like,

469
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:19,800
we're basically fucking like the scene 
in 2001 when they're around the 

470
00:21:20,051 --> 00:21:22,000
monolith.
That's what we're talking about.

471
00:21:22,001 --> 00:21:23,710
So we're talking about say how many 
people,

472
00:21:23,711 --> 00:21:25,180
how many people do you fit in a big 
stadium?

473
00:21:25,181 --> 00:21:26,640
One hundred,
hundred and 50,000,

474
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:28,690
something like that,
like 20 and football stage.

475
00:21:28,691 --> 00:21:29,530
And like the,
uh,

476
00:21:29,531 --> 00:21:33,160
the place that we did in Australia for 
the UFC I believe is 70,000

477
00:21:33,161 --> 00:21:34,510
people.
And that was an enormous.

478
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:38,770
Was that the MCG that was at a,
at a hod,

479
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,820
they've started sponsoring everything 
since I left.

480
00:21:41,821 --> 00:21:44,540
So I don't even know what that would be 
now because I don't know,

481
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,600
the big airline back then was in Sydney 
or Melbourne.

482
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:48,670
Melbourne.
I'd probably be the,

483
00:21:48,671 --> 00:21:50,390
uh,
the cricket ground rent formally.

484
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:52,420
The probably.
It's got a retractable roof.

485
00:21:52,421 --> 00:21:52,900
Yeah,
that's right.

486
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:56,140
It was the site of the biggest UFC ever 
and it was 70,000

487
00:21:56,141 --> 00:21:57,970
people and that's an enormous,
enormous place.

488
00:21:57,971 --> 00:22:00,550
But they have football places like Jim,
you're a football fan.

489
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:02,310
What's the biggest spot?
Uh,

490
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:07,350
I don't know if it's the exact biggest 
Ohio stadium in Columbus for the 

491
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:08,290
buckeyes plays like a 110.
They can fit in there and fill out eight

492
00:22:08,291 --> 00:22:10,490
officially thousand.
What is that like when it's filled?

493
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:12,280
I must be insane.
Super loud.

494
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:14,710
A I,
the way they have the sound going into,

495
00:22:14,711 --> 00:22:17,350
it's a little bit of bounce off each 
other being in it.

496
00:22:17,351 --> 00:22:18,810
So it's,
it's an insane.

497
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:23,900
That's good.
We've got to be with the colosseum was 

498
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:23,900
like ingrown and half,
half white,

499
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:27,601
but there's,
there's crazy people are drunk as shit 

500
00:22:27,601 --> 00:22:30,220
yelling at each other and there's fights
all over up into huge stadiums that are 

501
00:22:30,461 --> 00:22:33,220
like a hundred hundred and 10,000.
So let's say 100,000

502
00:22:33,221 --> 00:22:33,970
stadium.
Right,

503
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,140
right.
It's a big place,

504
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,690
but if you do use your analogy of 
Chicago.

505
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:41,980
My grandmother analogy,
that's 10 million years.

506
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:47,800
Oh my God,
what were we 10 million years ago?

507
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:50,020
We were rodents.
Well,

508
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:53,140
when did the dinosaurs die at 75 million
years ago.

509
00:22:53,141 --> 00:22:58,141
Apparently we were a type of almost like
a shrew looking road and that's what we 

510
00:22:58,781 --> 00:23:00,520
were.
That's the current.

511
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:04,660
That's what really makes evolutionary 
deniers angry,

512
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:09,720
you know,
the people who are just shitty little 

513
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:12,000
rats telling me that I was at Ohio state
football game filled paypal a go.

514
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:19,450
I wasn't true.
The crazy thing is that the science 

515
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:24,331
deniers,
the evolution denies other ones who are 

516
00:23:24,331 --> 00:23:24,460
more monkey like than the ones who 
believe in science.

517
00:23:24,461 --> 00:23:29,461
True.
That was an old bill Hicks bit is he 

518
00:23:29,461 --> 00:23:29,710
just do think about people being 
uninvolved,

519
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:35,140
the people that don't believe in 
evolution or the most looked the most 

520
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:35,140
unevolved.
Exactly,

521
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:35,890
yes.
Right.

522
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:37,780
Yeah.
Well it's,

523
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,240
it's too hard for us to.
I mean,

524
00:23:40,241 --> 00:23:45,241
we're sitting here,
we're not science deniers and we're 

525
00:23:45,241 --> 00:23:45,980
looking at the age of your grandma 100 
years and we're just going back a

526
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,530
few grandmas and we're like,
fuck.

527
00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:53,090
Well this is the first time.
I've been amazed by that though because 

528
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:53,090
I.
Although you know,

529
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:57,701
when else I had this feeling was Richard
Dawkins has this cool analogy where he 

530
00:23:58,321 --> 00:24:01,710
says,
imagine he's talking about how evolution

531
00:24:01,711 --> 00:24:06,711
denies.
I keep wanting to say climate deniers 

532
00:24:06,711 --> 00:24:06,711
evolution.
Denies we'll.

533
00:24:06,711 --> 00:24:07,680
We'll talk about how there were these 
gaps in the fossil record.

534
00:24:07,681 --> 00:24:09,060
Right?
And how like,

535
00:24:09,061 --> 00:24:14,061
well,
what happened to the species that were 

536
00:24:14,061 --> 00:24:15,681
interim species in between the species 
that we find Richard Dawkins tries to 

537
00:24:15,681 --> 00:24:20,361
make the point.
The whole concept of a species is 

538
00:24:20,361 --> 00:24:23,910
something that we sort of retroactively 
superimposed onto things because lots of

539
00:24:23,911 --> 00:24:26,190
animals,
because the vast majority of animals die

540
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:30,060
out and don't manage to succeed in this 
world.

541
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:33,540
The vast majority of mutations fail.
But he says,

542
00:24:33,541 --> 00:24:38,541
imagine getting a book.
Imagine getting a picture book like a 

543
00:24:38,541 --> 00:24:41,870
high school year book and it's got your 
photo in it on the last page and the 

544
00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:45,051
page before that is your mother's photo 
on the page before that is her mother's 

545
00:24:45,051 --> 00:24:45,630
photo in the page before that is her 
mother's photo.

546
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:50,630
Right?
And you go back and back and back and 

547
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:52,521
back,
all the way back to the first dawn of 

548
00:24:52,521 --> 00:24:54,390
life.
Hundreds of millions of years ago.

549
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:59,460
And each,
each page is going to be,

550
00:24:59,461 --> 00:25:01,470
is going to basically look like the page
before.

551
00:25:01,471 --> 00:25:05,580
It isn't going to be a point at which 
like the shrew becomes a monkey.

552
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:06,810
Or like,
you know,

553
00:25:06,811 --> 00:25:09,180
some amphibious creature becomes a 
shrew.

554
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:14,630
Every child looks like it's parent,
but as you flipped through the pages of 

555
00:25:14,701 --> 00:25:16,140
this book,
it's such a thick book.

556
00:25:16,141 --> 00:25:19,200
The overtime,
like one of those little cartoon figures

557
00:25:19,201 --> 00:25:21,270
that you could draw and it looks like 
it's moving on the page.

558
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:23,670
You just stopped morphing back,
back,

559
00:25:23,671 --> 00:25:24,210
back,
back,

560
00:25:24,211 --> 00:25:26,190
back until eventually you're a fucking 
fish,

561
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:29,760
but it's.
Well,

562
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:30,420
you know,
your great,

563
00:25:30,421 --> 00:25:30,840
great,
great,

564
00:25:30,841 --> 00:25:32,940
great.
Grandma is just adding enough grades.

565
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:35,880
Yeah,
and that's what people don't understand.

566
00:25:35,881 --> 00:25:37,410
It's just has to be a really,
really,

567
00:25:37,411 --> 00:25:37,980
really,
really,

568
00:25:37,981 --> 00:25:39,060
really big book.

569
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:40,600
Well,
our concept of time is just,

570
00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:42,680
it's too hard.
We'll look at it this way.

571
00:25:42,681 --> 00:25:46,610
Look at the changes that a person takes 
over the period of their life.

572
00:25:46,611 --> 00:25:48,500
Look at a person from,
you know,

573
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:53,480
think about a child and then turn that 
child in your grandma before she died.

574
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:56,930
That's a very different physical looking
thing as age sets in.

575
00:25:57,050 --> 00:25:57,530
Yeah,
sure.

576
00:25:57,590 --> 00:26:00,730
You know what I mean?
Like there's a lot of changes that go on

577
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:04,070
nature,
like the growth of animals,

578
00:26:04,071 --> 00:26:07,550
death of animals,
of plants and things along those lines.

579
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:12,790
There's all sorts of growth and death 
and all sorts of changing and while 

580
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:14,290
we're looking at it in a static form,
you'd,

581
00:26:14,291 --> 00:26:15,830
if you go outside and look at those 
trees,

582
00:26:15,831 --> 00:26:20,831
they look exactly the same as they'd 
looked yesterday and it takes a long 

583
00:26:20,831 --> 00:26:20,831
time before you recognize like,
oh,

584
00:26:20,831 --> 00:26:21,830
this fucking things,
growing,

585
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:27,270
feeling that,
feeling that myself kind of for the 

586
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:27,270
first time,
like my birthday yesterday,

587
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:29,980
and uh,
I've gotten to that age where,

588
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:31,600
you know,
I don't really care about.

589
00:26:31,601 --> 00:26:33,550
I didn't really know.
Like when I booked this trip,

590
00:26:33,551 --> 00:26:34,860
I didn't even know that it was my 
birthday.

591
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:36,910
How old he is today,
38.

592
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:38,830
That's when you start denying it.
I'm 48.

593
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:42,850
So really start denying it,
denying what getting older and attention

594
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:44,010
to has not

595
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:48,080
even important to me.
Why I'm concentrating on the present.

596
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:50,010
I live in the moment,
Joshua,

597
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:55,590
he just sees it.
It's a comforting bullshit as well.

598
00:26:55,610 --> 00:26:57,450
When you get to be like 78,
just like,

599
00:26:57,451 --> 00:26:58,410
what do you do?
I mean,

600
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:02,190
what are you going to not parasail 
because you're 78.

601
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:03,450
No,
that's right.

602
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:06,210
But I think that the most of it is true 
though,

603
00:27:06,211 --> 00:27:07,200
that like,
you know,

604
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:12,360
age is on the inside because I can feel 
that now at this age I just have to do a

605
00:27:12,511 --> 00:27:15,040
ship more work and not to feel crappy 
and 20,

606
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:17,160
22,
it's just everything is great.

607
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:21,570
Your body is just automatically 
functioning exactly as it should now.

608
00:27:21,571 --> 00:27:23,520
Like my ankle will just occasionally 
hurt.

609
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:25,230
You know,
that didn't happen when I was 22.

610
00:27:25,231 --> 00:27:27,000
I remember that.
I actually remember the first time in my

611
00:27:27,001 --> 00:27:31,260
life when I was getting out of a car and
as I got out of the car seat I went.

612
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:38,750
I was like,
what the fuck was that just grunt as I 

613
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:38,800
was getting up and you wanted to,
you know,

614
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:42,420
just a very small like just to get out 
of a car seat.

615
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:43,580
But you know,
just like,

616
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:45,480
like you might,
it's not a big deal.

617
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:50,510
It's just like a young teenager never,
never just leaps out of the cost seat 

618
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:51,240
was an old person.
Gets out of the car seat going.

619
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:54,990
That's a good point.
I might notice when I,

620
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:55,740
for the first time,

621
00:27:57,890 --> 00:27:58,880
yeah,
it's like I'm old,

622
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:03,910
I'm getting old,
got to exercise into my thirties and I 

623
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:06,671
see other things.
Nature is trying to kill you and in 

624
00:28:06,671 --> 00:28:09,980
nature would like you to give in to the 
same decay that you see in animals and 

625
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:14,200
the forest and what have you.
It would like you to just accept the 

626
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:17,111
natural process,
but us in our clever little minds have 

627
00:28:17,111 --> 00:28:20,441
figured out how to mitigate that process
at least slightly with exercise and 

628
00:28:20,441 --> 00:28:22,790
nutrition,
proper rest and supplementation,

629
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:28,150
hormone supplementation and going to the
doctors and new inventions and cryo 

630
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:32,960
therapy and all this crazy shit that 
people figured out how to just put the 

631
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:35,150
brakes on this fucking have it 
inevitable demise.

632
00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:37,070
I know we're living way too long for 
nature.

633
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:39,200
Nature loves us up until we're in our 
late teens,

634
00:28:39,201 --> 00:28:40,430
early twenties.
Yeah,

635
00:28:40,610 --> 00:28:45,350
but by now I've been like,
I've been coming sperm for decades.

636
00:28:45,351 --> 00:28:47,300
Nature's like you must have had kids by 
now,

637
00:28:47,301 --> 00:28:49,510
right to you.
Too much information.

638
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,740
I think everyone can.
Everyone can figure out that.

639
00:28:51,741 --> 00:28:54,070
I've probably been able to come since I 
was a teenager.

640
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:59,080
Maybe gone tantric,
you might be one of those dudes to come 

641
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,090
inside them and re re,
re vigorous there.

642
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,670
Is that a real thing?
Do they.

643
00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:06,730
Can you actually consistently orgasm 
over a long period of time without 

644
00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:06,730
coming?

645
00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:10,800
The problem with all that,
and I'm sure I'm going to get tweets 

646
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,561
about this,
is everyone who practices it is a 

647
00:29:13,561 --> 00:29:13,561
fucking lunatic so

648
00:29:13,561 --> 00:29:16,430
you don't know because you haven't 
actually tested it out.

649
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:17,810
Yeah,
so if you talk to them,

650
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:18,740
you know,
they'll tell you,

651
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:21,020
yes,
I completely come inside.

652
00:29:21,021 --> 00:29:23,240
I come internally,
I absorb,

653
00:29:23,241 --> 00:29:25,340
I reabsorb and the energy that I get 
from that,

654
00:29:25,341 --> 00:29:30,341
it's so much more amazing than the 
energy that you would get from an 

655
00:29:30,341 --> 00:29:33,340
external orgasm and then they just get 
like really into talking to you about 

656
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:33,340
tantric.
Annoying.

657
00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:35,210
You know,
I mean they do it,

658
00:29:35,211 --> 00:29:40,211
but is it by contracting that muscle,
the muscle is topped with a paid his 

659
00:29:40,211 --> 00:29:43,781
name.
I'm forgetting between your bowls and 

660
00:29:43,781 --> 00:29:45,480
yet know there's a.
there's a particular muscle there which 

661
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:45,910
apparently if you,
if you learn to build it up,

662
00:29:45,911 --> 00:29:47,620
like be doing exercises throughout the 
day,

663
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:53,160
then it can.
It will compress and it will push 

664
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:53,160
against,
uh,

665
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:53,160
the,
whatever the,

666
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:55,670
that tube is called.
I'm not really medically today,

667
00:29:55,690 --> 00:29:56,290
the decor.

668
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,530
So it's like a mail key goal,
right?

669
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:05,050
Yeah.
Have you ever seen that Russian lady 

670
00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:06,991
that can pick up?
I think she can carry like 32 kilograms 

671
00:30:06,991 --> 00:30:07,370
for the pussy.
It might be more than that.

672
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:11,890
More than 70 pounds I believe.
I haven't checked.

673
00:30:11,891 --> 00:30:13,690
Yeah.
She has this ability to like,

674
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:18,720
I guess they put like a ball and then 
attach a string to a ball at the end of 

675
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:23,161
the string is a weight and she puts that
ball inside of her pussy and just locks 

676
00:30:23,161 --> 00:30:28,140
down on that motherfucker and then can 
literally lift up like 70 pounds of 

677
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:28,140
weight.
It's impressive.

678
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,080
I've been,
I've,

679
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:34,110
I've stood,
I've stood at one end of a strip club 

680
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:38,730
and had a in Bangkok,
had a tie stripper five dots from the 

681
00:30:39,371 --> 00:30:44,371
other side of the room out of her pussy 
and pop a balloon that I was holding it 

682
00:30:44,371 --> 00:30:44,371
in my head.

683
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:47,560
Wow.
And she was,

684
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:49,840
she could find those things with such 
aim.

685
00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:53,050
I don't know why I was so stupid because
I could have gotten taken an eye out,

686
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:55,720
but what kind of speed?
Speed,

687
00:30:56,890 --> 00:30:58,300
speed.
Like uh,

688
00:30:58,301 --> 00:31:00,270
what?
She must have been a good 10 meters,

689
00:31:00,271 --> 00:31:02,400
so maybe 30 feet away from me.
Oh my God.

690
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:07,440
She's firing him across the room fast 
enough to be able to pop a balloon with 

691
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:07,440
accuracy,
with accuracy.

692
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,530
That's insane.
Now how is she doing this?

693
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:13,540
And she have like her elbows to the back
of her knees and she's got her like her 

694
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:13,630
pussy up in the air.
No,

695
00:31:13,631 --> 00:31:18,631
she was standing up.
I'm trying to picture exactly what 

696
00:31:18,631 --> 00:31:18,631
position she was in.
GSG was sort of kneel,

697
00:31:18,631 --> 00:31:20,200
kneeling and standing.
Kneeling.

698
00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:20,920
Oh wait,
no,

699
00:31:20,921 --> 00:31:21,350
sorry.
Not,

700
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,110
not kneeling.
Bent.

701
00:31:23,111 --> 00:31:28,111
Knees bent.
Standing Upright and with the thrust of 

702
00:31:28,111 --> 00:31:28,840
the hips for shooting out what?

703
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:31,270
Bent knees.
Standing up or facing you?

704
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:33,610
Facing me.
Wow.

705
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:38,700
That's crazy.
That doesn't even seem like that's like 

706
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:38,800
shooting a gun in the air when you're 
pointing at the ground.

707
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:41,230
It didn't even make any sense.
How did she do that?

708
00:31:41,770 --> 00:31:45,430
She might've had a hands on the ground.
To be honest,

709
00:31:45,431 --> 00:31:50,431
Joe.
I wasn't focused on her fucking 

710
00:31:50,431 --> 00:31:51,751
position.
I was focused on whether or not she was 

711
00:31:51,751 --> 00:31:51,751
going to take my.
I had my eyes closed most of the time.

712
00:31:51,751 --> 00:31:55,290
Well,
if she had her hands on the ground now 

713
00:31:55,290 --> 00:31:56,551
it makes perfect sense.
So she's like a table table sitting 

714
00:31:56,551 --> 00:31:56,551
upright.
Yeah.

715
00:31:56,551 --> 00:31:58,600
How's she getting the air to launch that
thing?

716
00:31:59,770 --> 00:32:02,980
That's what's confusing about that.
It was so many things that she was doing

717
00:32:02,981 --> 00:32:04,660
like that.
They have all kinds of tricks.

718
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:06,480
They will concentrate.
They were pink.

719
00:32:06,610 --> 00:32:08,320
It started out with ping pong balls,
you know,

720
00:32:08,321 --> 00:32:09,190
all the classic things.

721
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:11,200
Also razorblades.
Oh,

722
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:17,580
it's not pleasant.
It's an amazing what people will do if 

723
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:20,731
you're confronted with a town filled 
with drunk tourists who have already 

724
00:32:20,731 --> 00:32:22,180
seen everything.
They've seen more.

725
00:32:22,181 --> 00:32:26,500
Thai kickboxing fights were 16 year old 
kid's a fucking Shinde each other in the

726
00:32:26,501 --> 00:32:31,501
head until they go unconscious.
They've seen legalized prostitution 

727
00:32:31,501 --> 00:32:32,770
everywhere.
Ladyboys everywhere.

728
00:32:32,771 --> 00:32:37,771
Everything is chaos.
Just fucking scooters with 37 people 

729
00:32:37,771 --> 00:32:38,930
piled on him.
And what do they got to do?

730
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:44,090
Do they have to adapt to its evolution?
It's adapt or die.

731
00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:45,800
You know,
you have to adapt.

732
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:48,180
You have to figure out how to,
how to,

733
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:49,730
how to stand out.
Well,

734
00:32:49,731 --> 00:32:51,050
you got to shoot a dart out of your 
pussy,

735
00:32:51,051 --> 00:32:52,550
honey.
Just tips his head.

736
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:53,270
Yeah.
There's,

737
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:54,100
I mean,
you want,

738
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:57,380
you want to make the argument that 
people are malleable.

739
00:32:57,780 --> 00:33:00,260
That's one of the best arguments.
Like put that.

740
00:33:00,261 --> 00:33:00,560
That's

741
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:06,340
not to mention like,
I mean I've been to shows there where 

742
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:08,930
they're just like,
I remember the finale to one show where 

743
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:11,981
it was like they were about how many do 
you go to Thailand?

744
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:17,890
Thailand is,
I like to say that Thailand is sort of 

745
00:33:17,890 --> 00:33:17,890
our Mexico.
If you're Australian,

746
00:33:17,890 --> 00:33:19,520
it's nearby.
It's cheap.

747
00:33:19,521 --> 00:33:20,610
It's beautiful.
Uh,

748
00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:23,390
they were great beaches.
How far is the flight?

749
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:28,750
I mean everything's sort of far from for
most Australians because Sydney and 

750
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:30,410
Melbourne are located on the southeast 
coast of Australia,

751
00:33:30,411 --> 00:33:31,840
so there's a lot of Australia to fly 
over.

752
00:33:31,870 --> 00:33:34,190
Australia is the same size as the 
contiguous United States.

753
00:33:34,191 --> 00:33:38,360
So you basically have to do the entire 
flight from like the equivalent of Miami

754
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:40,940
to Seattle before you start entering 
Asiana air space.

755
00:33:40,941 --> 00:33:43,730
But from so from Australia,
the country itself,

756
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:46,580
it would probably only be two or three 
hours to Bangkok.

757
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:51,260
It's only like an hour or two to 
Indonesia and Singapore from Sydney.

758
00:33:51,261 --> 00:33:56,261
Then you've got to add on an extra six 
hours just to get out of Australian 

759
00:33:56,261 --> 00:33:58,931
airspace.
That's amazing that you guys are the 

760
00:33:58,931 --> 00:34:01,031
same size.
That Australia's the same size as 

761
00:34:01,031 --> 00:34:01,550
America as far as the continental or 
close to it.

762
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:04,850
But there's only 20 million people,
so there's less people than California.

763
00:34:04,851 --> 00:34:05,780
We have half.
We have,

764
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:10,800
yeah,
mean two thirds of the population of 

765
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:10,800
California in an area the size of the 
United States.

766
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,770
If you get rid of Alaska.
So bad ass country.

767
00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:14,060
I fucking love it there.
I was just there.

768
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:14,990
I know you were.
Yeah,

769
00:34:14,991 --> 00:34:15,860
that whole upset.

770
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:21,100
I had a great fucking time.
I did stand up there to the Palais 

771
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:21,100
theater.
It's fucking gradable.

772
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:21,980
I love it up there.
Down there.

773
00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:24,140
Wherever the fuck it is.
Depends on which way you go.

774
00:34:24,170 --> 00:34:26,450
Exactly.
If you go north you can get there.

775
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:30,940
You'll get there eventually the gloves 
round chair spinning.

776
00:34:30,950 --> 00:34:33,100
The fucker doesn't stand still.
But uh,

777
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:34,430
it's,
I love Australia.

778
00:34:34,431 --> 00:34:36,020
It's an awesome country.
Really is.

779
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,370
It's great.
They're cool as fuck.

780
00:34:37,410 --> 00:34:38,110
Yeah.
Yeah.

781
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:39,440
Policies are nice.
It's great.

782
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:43,010
That's the,
that's my number one go to spot.

783
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:46,520
If the apocalypse happens,
if north the North America falls apart,

784
00:34:46,610 --> 00:34:48,320
Australia is pretty much self 
supporting.

785
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:52,610
It's a democratic really cool.
Nice people.

786
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:53,920
Yup.
Last spice,

787
00:34:53,930 --> 00:34:57,510
plenty of animals to eat.
Plenty of land to fish.

788
00:34:57,820 --> 00:35:02,820
She,
I mean you've got the whole South 

789
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:02,820
Pacific right there.
Yeah.

790
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:05,311
You just can't.
You got to watch out for your fucking 

791
00:35:05,311 --> 00:35:05,311
killer jellyfish.

792
00:35:05,311 --> 00:35:05,311
Everywhere you turn you have something 
that can kill you.

793
00:35:05,311 --> 00:35:05,540
That's true.
They have.

794
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:09,410
If people don't know you got to look up 
this thing called box jelly fish because

795
00:35:09,411 --> 00:35:14,411
they have,
they get a bay filled with box jelly 

796
00:35:14,411 --> 00:35:14,540
fish and they'll say don't go in the 
water,

797
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:17,660
the box jelly fish or they're instantly.
How do you say?

798
00:35:17,661 --> 00:35:19,640
Straight off.
Straight off.

799
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:20,540
Kelly.
Australia off.

800
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:23,180
Yeah.
And they will kill you instantly.

801
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:25,700
Like there's just paralyze you.
When you go into anaphylactic shock.

802
00:35:25,701 --> 00:35:26,660
Dead,
you're dead.

803
00:35:26,661 --> 00:35:31,160
I mean some people survive if you get 
hit with like one or two tentacles.

804
00:35:31,161 --> 00:35:33,590
But you're fucked man,
for like years.

805
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:34,820
Yeah.
We'll get in the water.

806
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:38,370
What the fuck does that mean?
God Damn water.

807
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,930
But in all of the areas of Australia 
first start,

808
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,600
they're only there during certain times 
of the year.

809
00:35:42,601 --> 00:35:44,520
So you were there in summer and they're 
not.

810
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,410
They're not in Sydney or Melbourne,
so didn't have to worry about them.

811
00:35:46,411 --> 00:35:47,630
They're,
they're only in.

812
00:35:47,631 --> 00:35:49,560
Did you must have gone up to the Great 
Barrier Reef or something?

813
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:49,980
No,
no,

814
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:51,150
no.
I was just talking to people.

815
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:54,020
I didn't go in the fucking water.
I'm not retarded.

816
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:57,690
You can go into the water and melons.
They move around the water.

817
00:35:57,691 --> 00:35:58,880
I don't know if you know,
it's just like,

818
00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:01,530
it's all connected.
They could just travel to,

819
00:36:01,531 --> 00:36:06,531
you know,
that's like saying that you're going to 

820
00:36:06,531 --> 00:36:06,531
get eaten by a great white shark and 
Alaska,

821
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:11,750
Alaska don't go in the water and Alaska 
if it's connected to where the great 

822
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:11,750
white sharks live.
So just never.

823
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:12,300
Anyway.
Water.

824
00:36:12,301 --> 00:36:17,301
It's the same water.
We're talking about gigantic distances 

825
00:36:17,301 --> 00:36:17,301
as far as we know.
As far as we know,

826
00:36:17,301 --> 00:36:17,610
they don't go there,
but they could.

827
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:18,420
It's like,
no,

828
00:36:18,421 --> 00:36:20,790
they couldn't be too cold for him.

829
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,880
If you knew that the woods,
the woods were filled with werewolves,

830
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,730
but only in a certain time of the year,
would you go during the full moon?

831
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:30,060
No,
you wouldn't answer for you.

832
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:34,020
Depends on what is that?
What you're saying is basically like you

833
00:36:34,021 --> 00:36:37,680
shouldn't go hiking in Panama because 
there are bears in Canada.

834
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:39,210
That's exactly what I'm saying.
Yeah,

835
00:36:39,211 --> 00:36:40,170
there you go.
So we've got a,

836
00:36:40,171 --> 00:36:40,660
we've got a,
uh,

837
00:36:40,661 --> 00:36:43,260
Jamie's just bring up the fingers are 
brainstorming is a dangerous.

838
00:36:43,261 --> 00:36:47,730
Don't swim in these waters between 
October and May.

839
00:36:47,730 --> 00:36:49,260
Severe box jelly sting you.
So what do they emergency treatment?

840
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:49,950
Oh,
that's one of those.

841
00:36:49,951 --> 00:36:52,830
They have a bucket of vinegar and so it 
doesn't,

842
00:36:52,890 --> 00:36:54,310
you're still fucked.
There's a,

843
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,760
um,
there's a species called the era Kanji,

844
00:36:56,761 --> 00:36:59,180
which I can't remember whether it's the 
same as the box jellyfish or not.

845
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:00,660
Someone's going to tweet me now that 
I've said that,

846
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:06,620
and it was a case where these scientists
on the Great Barrier Reef that was 

847
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:08,210
studying the ecology and they're almost 
invisible.

848
00:37:08,210 --> 00:37:11,490
Every tiny small little jellyfish with 
extremely long tentacles.

849
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:16,910
And um,
they do the same thing as the box 

850
00:37:16,910 --> 00:37:16,950
jellyfish if they're not the same thing 
as the box jellyfish.

851
00:37:16,951 --> 00:37:18,600
And they had,
they had a,

852
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:24,020
uh,
like a cotton bought a bottle of era 

853
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:27,771
Kanji in water and they put it in the 
fridge and a dude came in and drank the 

854
00:37:27,771 --> 00:37:31,380
water drinking water and died instantly.
Oh my God.

855
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:33,150
Yeah.
Jesus Christ.

856
00:37:33,151 --> 00:37:38,151
What a label on it.
You already get fucked up fucking skull 

857
00:37:38,151 --> 00:37:38,151
and crossbones on that Shit.
Yeah,

858
00:37:38,151 --> 00:37:39,630
there you go.
There's an energy that is,

859
00:37:39,631 --> 00:37:41,470
that little tiny thing will kill you.
Yeah.

860
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:44,960
What the fuck man went bad and us?
No,

861
00:37:44,970 --> 00:37:48,630
you need to clean your water out of is 
filled with the enemy.

862
00:37:49,290 --> 00:37:51,330
Those are murderers.
She gets.

863
00:37:51,331 --> 00:37:56,331
Some government is saying that we're not
going to let any or congee into the 

864
00:37:56,331 --> 00:37:56,331
country anymore.

865
00:37:56,331 --> 00:37:56,730
That is insane.
It's insane.

866
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,580
That little tiny thing can kill you.
Yeah.

867
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:01,590
That is unbelievable.
I made only Americans.

868
00:38:01,591 --> 00:38:06,591
Mike,
a big deal out of how dangerous things 

869
00:38:06,591 --> 00:38:06,591
in Australia is.
You fuckers are used to it.

870
00:38:06,591 --> 00:38:09,210
It's like the lady with the ping pong 
balls coming out of her pussy.

871
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:14,540
That's normal in Thailand.
I mean the reality about Australia is 

872
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:14,540
everyone's.
We've,

873
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:16,530
we've managed to export this.
Steve Irwin,

874
00:38:16,531 --> 00:38:21,531
the crocodile hunter,
vision of Australia as big as if we're 

875
00:38:21,531 --> 00:38:22,720
all like a rugged outdoorsman who live 
in the,

876
00:38:22,730 --> 00:38:24,120
in the bush,
in the outback.

877
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:28,410
Duality is almost half the country lives
in to big cities and we were all sitting

878
00:38:28,411 --> 00:38:30,810
around swilling shodan and drinking 
lattes,

879
00:38:30,811 --> 00:38:35,811
complaining about property prices and 
sitting on yachts and going to the 

880
00:38:35,811 --> 00:38:38,961
beach.
A very few Australians live in the 

881
00:38:38,961 --> 00:38:38,961
outback.
We're very urbanized country.

882
00:38:38,961 --> 00:38:40,300
We don't.
I mean America is much more,

883
00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:45,570
has much more regional variance in that,
like there's no equivalent of the south 

884
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:46,110
in Australia,
in the Midwest statement.

885
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:50,140
Melbourne is a.
was incredible as far as like the food.

886
00:38:50,330 --> 00:38:51,920
The food was amazing,
isn't it?

887
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:54,760
Yeah.
Coffee and the food and the wine.

888
00:38:54,850 --> 00:38:56,430
Oh my God.
Like you.

889
00:38:56,590 --> 00:38:57,820
They know how to live.
Yeah,

890
00:38:57,821 --> 00:39:01,450
we're doing it right yet,
but get killed everywhere,

891
00:39:01,690 --> 00:39:05,500
but that's my point.
Jelly fucking not coming into the hub.

892
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:10,520
A couple of those brown snakes as well.
They're not coming into into downtown 

893
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:10,930
everywhere.
You can find them.

894
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:13,660
My friend Adam,
my friend Adam Green tree,

895
00:39:13,690 --> 00:39:16,350
he lives out there and he told he he 
works,

896
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,290
uh,
he,

897
00:39:17,291 --> 00:39:17,920
uh,
his uh,

898
00:39:17,950 --> 00:39:20,670
business and something involved minds 
and uh,

899
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:25,740
they'll,
they'll be working like digging holes 

900
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:25,740
and um,
you know,

901
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:27,190
uh,
doing stuff out in the bush,

902
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:32,220
I guess you guys call it the bush and 
they'll just find these brown snakes 

903
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:33,610
which would just fucking kill you.
They bite you and you're dead.

904
00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:34,090
Yeah.

905
00:39:34,390 --> 00:39:34,990
Yeah.
Well,

906
00:39:34,991 --> 00:39:39,991
we'll find them.
Actually people haven't died from a 

907
00:39:39,991 --> 00:39:42,361
snake bite or a spider,
but I don't think since all of the 

908
00:39:42,361 --> 00:39:42,700
antivenoms were discovered in the early 
eighties because every,

909
00:39:42,790 --> 00:39:45,690
every local medical center has the only 
antivenoms.

910
00:39:45,730 --> 00:39:48,500
How long does it take for a brown snake?
Achillea Alice.

911
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:49,360
Oh,
okay.

912
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:51,760
Yeah,
you've got a little bit of time and most

913
00:39:51,761 --> 00:39:54,010
Australians are trained in knowing how 
to basically,

914
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:59,060
you know,
obviously put a [inaudible] on so that 

915
00:39:59,060 --> 00:39:59,590
you can,
maybe you suck out the venom and spit it

916
00:39:59,591 --> 00:40:01,960
out and identify what the snake was.
Well,

917
00:40:01,961 --> 00:40:05,650
I find rattlesnakes on my property out 
here all the time.

918
00:40:05,651 --> 00:40:07,100
How long do they take to kill you?
It'll kill you.

919
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:08,920
It'll take a few hours,
but it'll fuck you up.

920
00:40:08,921 --> 00:40:13,921
I've had my dogs bitten three times.
I've had to have them go and get 

921
00:40:13,921 --> 00:40:15,850
antivenom.
And for people if you're broke,

922
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,650
it's fucked because you don't have any 
money.

923
00:40:17,890 --> 00:40:20,650
It costs thousands of dollars.
This antivenom stuff and you know,

924
00:40:20,651 --> 00:40:23,710
otherwise you're going to watch your dog
die because they swell up.

925
00:40:23,770 --> 00:40:28,770
Like the only way I found out they got 
bit because I knew that they were 

926
00:40:28,770 --> 00:40:29,230
barking and barking and barking.
So I went outside and said,

927
00:40:29,231 --> 00:40:30,640
ah fuck,
there's a rattle snake.

928
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:33,680
And so I killed a rattlesnake and then,
um,

929
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:38,760
they seem okay,
but then all sudden I see some swelling 

930
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:38,760
on their face.
I'm like,

931
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:42,470
God it.
And so that I have to take him down 

932
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:44,371
because they'll rattle.
Snake will bite them and then pull away 

933
00:40:44,371 --> 00:40:44,371
and still be alive and invite,
bite them again.

934
00:40:44,371 --> 00:40:48,600
And so their,
their face just swole up like cartoon 

935
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:49,150
and just like water balloon.
Now they're finding a day or so.

936
00:40:49,210 --> 00:40:49,780
Yeah.
Good.

937
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,410
It's just expensive.
Um,

938
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:53,170
I mean if a person gets bitten in 
Australia,

939
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:55,330
obviously they don't have to pay because
we have communism.

940
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:57,850
That's a good,
that's a good communism,

941
00:40:58,030 --> 00:41:03,030
you know that I get really pissed off 
when people talk about healthcare and 

942
00:41:03,430 --> 00:41:08,430
healthcare in America and this,
this idea that somehow or another it's 

943
00:41:08,430 --> 00:41:11,521
better to not have people covered with 
medical insurance and then there's 

944
00:41:11,521 --> 00:41:12,940
always been medicaid and there's always 
been,

945
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:16,420
for extreme example,
people have had medical issues that have

946
00:41:16,421 --> 00:41:19,420
put them in severe debt and this 
doesn't.

947
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:24,760
I don't,
I don't think that we shouldn't have 

948
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:27,570
private private care in terms of like 
the best doctors and the best surgeons 

949
00:41:27,570 --> 00:41:29,880
should be allowed to be compensated for 
their excellence.

950
00:41:29,881 --> 00:41:34,881
I mean,
I don't think there's anything wrong 

951
00:41:34,881 --> 00:41:35,881
with that,
but the idea that we don't have some 

952
00:41:35,881 --> 00:41:35,881
sort of.
I,

953
00:41:35,881 --> 00:41:36,980
we have roads that are taken care of by 
our taxes.

954
00:41:36,981 --> 00:41:41,981
Why the fuck do we not have medical 
insurance or or medical care?

955
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:47,500
That's just standard and this is exactly
what we're going to talk about on my 

956
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:47,510
podcast.

957
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:52,540
Hashtag we the people live which is to,
which we're going to do immediately 

958
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:56,081
after this because I want to talk to you
about Bernie Sanders and I want to talk 

959
00:41:56,081 --> 00:41:58,210
to you,
but if you're talking about right now 

960
00:41:58,210 --> 00:41:58,210
too,
we can do it,

961
00:41:58,210 --> 00:41:58,210
but we do it later now.
Whatever.

962
00:41:58,340 --> 00:42:00,730
Freaking people out there like what the 
fuck I got to download something else,

963
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:07,500
but it's.
I just think that a country that cares 

964
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:09,821
about its people,
one of the most important things is the 

965
00:42:09,821 --> 00:42:09,821
safety and the health of the people.
Like,

966
00:42:09,821 --> 00:42:11,090
okay,
well we shouldn't have.

967
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:13,670
You shouldn't have to pay for the 
police.

968
00:42:13,671 --> 00:42:16,940
You shouldn't have to pay for the army.
It shouldn't be something that comes out

969
00:42:16,941 --> 00:42:18,200
of your check.
Like,

970
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:18,770
you know,
Oh,

971
00:42:18,771 --> 00:42:20,060
you want to call the police?
Well,

972
00:42:20,061 --> 00:42:21,900
we're going to require a credit card.
No,

973
00:42:21,930 --> 00:42:23,210
no guys breaking into my house.

974
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:23,920
Well,
uh,

975
00:42:23,930 --> 00:42:26,440
do you have a current credit card?
Like,

976
00:42:26,450 --> 00:42:26,870
no,
no,

977
00:42:26,871 --> 00:42:27,460
no,
no.

978
00:42:27,470 --> 00:42:28,370
We need the cops.
I mean,

979
00:42:28,371 --> 00:42:32,530
I hear people like rush limbaugh saying,
should we buy everyone a car?

980
00:42:33,130 --> 00:42:35,390
Yeah,
he was a fat fuck.

981
00:42:35,450 --> 00:42:40,450
Well I don't listen to him.
Do you remember fucking pill popping 

982
00:42:40,450 --> 00:42:43,541
asshole Al Franken was on,
was on lead them and promoting his book 

983
00:42:43,541 --> 00:42:43,541
about a rush.
Cold.

984
00:42:43,541 --> 00:42:47,860
Rush limbaugh is a big fat idiot.
Remember he wouldn't be able to write 

985
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:47,860
that book today because he'd be fat 
shit.

986
00:42:47,870 --> 00:42:50,050
That's probably true actually.
And let him in.

987
00:42:50,051 --> 00:42:53,210
His first question is uh oh.
That's an interesting title.

988
00:42:53,211 --> 00:42:54,540
How'd you come up with that title at 
all?

989
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:56,840
Goes well for a start.
He's,

990
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:58,610
he's very,
very fat.

991
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:03,050
I love Al didn't even lose a lot of 
weight though.

992
00:43:03,051 --> 00:43:07,130
When he got on Oxycontin's it's taken 
like 99 pills a day.

993
00:43:07,131 --> 00:43:09,560
That fills up a lot of whole,
like,

994
00:43:09,561 --> 00:43:12,140
you know,
you think about how many 99.

995
00:43:12,190 --> 00:43:15,040
Oxycontin.
That's a good handful of mass.

996
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:16,080
Was He,
is that what he's done?

997
00:43:16,110 --> 00:43:16,630
No,
no,

998
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:21,800
no.
It's fairly standard for like severe 

999
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:25,361
junkies.
Like it's they just start building up 

1000
00:43:25,361 --> 00:43:28,870
two and three to 12.
This is why you then you then graduate 

1001
00:43:28,870 --> 00:43:29,570
to smack and why?
We've got the heroin epidemic that we do

1002
00:43:29,571 --> 00:43:32,030
in places like too hard.
You got to shoot it.

1003
00:43:32,090 --> 00:43:34,100
Like it's really easy to swallow those 
pills.

1004
00:43:34,101 --> 00:43:35,640
You can snort it,
you can smoke,

1005
00:43:35,970 --> 00:43:38,600
but you're also.
You're getting this inexact amount.

1006
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:41,030
When you just take a pill,
you have one pill,

1007
00:43:41,031 --> 00:43:42,830
you throw it down,
your fats do 99.

1008
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:44,240
That's a WHO's taken a lot.

1009
00:43:44,410 --> 00:43:46,580
Pull that up Jamie.
Find out exactly how many he was taking.

1010
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:51,760
He was taking so much that and granted 
this was told to me by Alex Jones,

1011
00:43:51,950 --> 00:43:56,950
so I don't know exactly if I can 
authenticate the brasses particular 

1012
00:43:57,081 --> 00:44:02,081
states like that quote,
but he said that that was why he went 

1013
00:44:02,081 --> 00:44:02,870
deaf because do you remember rush 
limbaugh was going deaf,

1014
00:44:03,170 --> 00:44:08,170
but he had like a real medical 
explanation for when you overdose on 

1015
00:44:08,170 --> 00:44:12,880
opiates.
When you take massive amounts of 

1016
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:14,921
opiates,
it affects your central nervous system 

1017
00:44:14,921 --> 00:44:16,290
in such a profound way and it affects 
your life,

1018
00:44:16,310 --> 00:44:21,260
like your entire physical body in such a
profound way that it's possible.

1019
00:44:21,350 --> 00:44:26,350
You could induce hearing loss.
I mean I have sympathy for the guy just 

1020
00:44:26,350 --> 00:44:30,191
because he's caught up in what is a 
problem beyond any individual's sort of 

1021
00:44:30,191 --> 00:44:30,191
control,
like the,

1022
00:44:30,191 --> 00:44:34,850
the,
the problem of over prescription of 

1023
00:44:34,850 --> 00:44:34,850
opiates in America and like drug 
addiction.

1024
00:44:34,850 --> 00:44:36,090
Did you see that study,
but it wasn't.

1025
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:41,120
He wasn't overprescribed.
He was actively seeking out these 

1026
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:41,340
prescriptions.
He was in Florida,

1027
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:42,470
but it's an.
It's an.

1028
00:44:42,570 --> 00:44:43,830
I mean,
it's an addiction.

1029
00:44:43,890 --> 00:44:47,600
It is an addiction,
but he was also a massive hypocrite.

1030
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:49,370
That was totally,
totally bad.

1031
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:51,990
People really disagree with almost 
everything he says.

1032
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:57,200
I have a grudging admiration for him as 
an entertainer and a broadcast because 

1033
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:57,510
they think he's so great.
Well,

1034
00:44:57,511 --> 00:44:59,530
he speaks very confidently.
Well,

1035
00:44:59,531 --> 00:45:04,531
he's so good at like saying at getting 
you into a position in which his 

1036
00:45:04,561 --> 00:45:09,561
bullshit sounds reasonable and like 
drawing a kind of a line of logical 

1037
00:45:10,081 --> 00:45:12,570
fallacies in such a way that you end up 
thinking,

1038
00:45:12,890 --> 00:45:14,970
yeah,
this guy's making a lot of sense.

1039
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:20,000
What's interesting is that he was really
hamstrung and broken down when he called

1040
00:45:20,131 --> 00:45:25,131
that a woman,
a slut who was trying to get birth 

1041
00:45:25,131 --> 00:45:26,030
control,
like she was trying to get a.

1042
00:45:26,570 --> 00:45:30,850
She wanted birth control to be covered 
by her university.

1043
00:45:30,890 --> 00:45:33,360
I'm sure it's some sort of insurance and
you know,

1044
00:45:33,361 --> 00:45:36,240
he started calling her a slut and St 
Louis terrible things about it,

1045
00:45:36,390 --> 00:45:39,300
but I believe she needed birth control 
because of another medical ailment.

1046
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:41,580
It wasn't just.
I might be wrong about that,

1047
00:45:41,850 --> 00:45:46,850
but it might weigh the weigh what his 
argument was and it's a perfect example 

1048
00:45:46,850 --> 00:45:47,310
of what I'm talking about where he 
starts with something simple.

1049
00:45:47,311 --> 00:45:49,130
He's like,
what do you call it?

1050
00:45:49,131 --> 00:45:54,131
A woman who wants to be paid for sex.
That's a pretty good.

1051
00:45:54,390 --> 00:45:56,200
You've got to get rid of the Australian 
accent.

1052
00:45:58,740 --> 00:46:00,990
I'm not saying I do rush this.
I wouldn't do.

1053
00:46:00,991 --> 00:46:05,580
I wouldn't say I wouldn't claim to be 
and trough so,

1054
00:46:05,581 --> 00:46:08,760
but like he ended up getting two slot 
because his logical argument was right.

1055
00:46:09,090 --> 00:46:12,540
She wants to be paid for something that 
is only needed.

1056
00:46:12,541 --> 00:46:17,541
If she wants to have recreational sex.
Well what do you call someone who we 

1057
00:46:17,541 --> 00:46:18,540
paid to have recreational sex?
A prostitute.

1058
00:46:19,430 --> 00:46:22,320
Jamie,
find that out if you get a chance.

1059
00:46:22,321 --> 00:46:25,110
But I do believe that she needed it for 
another reason.

1060
00:46:25,111 --> 00:46:27,120
There's other reasons why women take 
birth.

1061
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:28,380
True.
Absolutely.

1062
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:33,400
Like they,
like women with severe acne take birth 

1063
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:33,400
control.
Um,

1064
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:37,730
there's a lot of,
there's a lot of other things at birth 

1065
00:46:37,730 --> 00:46:40,461
control can help,
but either way he's a fat fuck of a 

1066
00:46:40,461 --> 00:46:43,161
dummy.
He is not that there's anything wrong 

1067
00:46:43,161 --> 00:46:43,161
with being a fat fuck.
Some of my best friends are fat.

1068
00:46:43,161 --> 00:46:44,670
Fuck.
Nothing wrong with being overweight.

1069
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:45,570
Ladies and gentlemen.
Well,

1070
00:46:45,571 --> 00:46:47,820
there's something wrong for you.
It's not healthy,

1071
00:46:48,060 --> 00:46:49,800
but you know,
you could fix that.

1072
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:51,360
It's hard,
but you could fix that.

1073
00:46:51,361 --> 00:46:54,180
Just as easy as it is to get off of 
heroin is easy.

1074
00:46:54,181 --> 00:46:55,790
It is for rush limbaugh to get off 
heroin,

1075
00:46:55,791 --> 00:47:00,791
he'd get off sugar and simple fucking 
carbs and all that stupid shit that 

1076
00:47:00,791 --> 00:47:05,451
makes you balloon up like that.
Maybe just walk on a treadmill for 30 

1077
00:47:05,451 --> 00:47:05,451
minutes.
Tara morning,

1078
00:47:05,451 --> 00:47:07,620
Tara hard for people to change their 
patterns.

1079
00:47:07,621 --> 00:47:12,621
It's hard for people to get excited 
about doing something that's difficult 

1080
00:47:12,621 --> 00:47:12,621
to do.
That's going to be ultimately beneficial

1081
00:47:12,621 --> 00:47:15,450
for them because it makes,
it drains your energy in the short term.

1082
00:47:15,930 --> 00:47:17,490
You know,
you work out if you're out of shape,

1083
00:47:17,491 --> 00:47:19,620
you ever seen an attache person workout?
Yeah.

1084
00:47:19,710 --> 00:47:20,700
Fuck man,
horrible.

1085
00:47:20,830 --> 00:47:23,490
I've taken people to the gym that don't 
work out like come on,

1086
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:28,520
come to the gym with me.
We'll just do a little bit of a workout 

1087
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:28,710
and you get them on the elliptical 
machine and just go,

1088
00:47:28,711 --> 00:47:30,190
we're going to do 20 minutes

1089
00:47:30,190 --> 00:47:33,190
and the elliptical machine and you look 
over five minutes in there,

1090
00:47:33,191 --> 00:47:38,191
ready to fucking die.
I mean there they turned white like 

1091
00:47:38,191 --> 00:47:39,640
their face turns flush.
It's crazy.

1092
00:47:39,641 --> 00:47:42,580
It's weird to watch.
You watch them struggle and then you get

1093
00:47:42,581 --> 00:47:44,920
them to the weights and they just,
they can't do anything.

1094
00:47:44,921 --> 00:47:46,030
They're so tired.

1095
00:47:46,140 --> 00:47:51,040
Did you see the study that came out 
recently about the huge increase in the,

1096
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:52,260
in the death,
right?

1097
00:47:52,261 --> 00:47:56,970
The fatality rate of white people 
between the age of 35 and 50,

1098
00:47:56,971 --> 00:47:58,080
I think it was.
No.

1099
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:03,320
So there's a spike which epidemiologists
are saying is as noticeable in the data 

1100
00:48:03,660 --> 00:48:07,860
as the aids epidemic was in the 19 
eighties and there were three causes.

1101
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:09,150
Lattes?
No,

1102
00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:11,850
I thought it was going to be diet.
Like when we're talking about this,

1103
00:48:11,851 --> 00:48:13,170
I thought it was going to be hard to 
say.

1104
00:48:13,171 --> 00:48:15,180
So something that's related to diet and 
exercise,

1105
00:48:15,780 --> 00:48:20,040
it's suicide,
it's booze and its drug overdoses.

1106
00:48:20,190 --> 00:48:25,190
Wow.
And this is the only demographic group 

1107
00:48:25,190 --> 00:48:25,290
in America where the numbers are going 
up.

1108
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:29,310
Well I think there are,
there's a lot of people that live a very

1109
00:48:29,311 --> 00:48:34,311
unsatisfying life and they got roped 
into living this unsatisfying life 

1110
00:48:34,311 --> 00:48:35,340
because someone told them that they have
to make a living,

1111
00:48:35,590 --> 00:48:40,590
that they have to make tough choices and
they have to go do things that they 

1112
00:48:40,590 --> 00:48:40,590
don't want to do and then,
you know,

1113
00:48:40,590 --> 00:48:45,440
find a good job with a fucking plumbing 
supply company or some stupid shit they 

1114
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:47,820
don't really want to do when they really
want to be a musician or whatever.

1115
00:48:48,030 --> 00:48:50,050
And then they just lived,
pressed and there's.

1116
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:52,080
I think that's a giant percentage of 
people.

1117
00:48:52,250 --> 00:48:53,610
Yeah.
And it's getting worse.

1118
00:48:53,611 --> 00:48:56,580
I was talking yesterday on facebook to a
buddy of mine in Australia,

1119
00:48:57,110 --> 00:48:58,200
Jacobstein.
Hey Jack.

1120
00:48:58,210 --> 00:49:01,830
I'm sure he'll be Liz Taylor.
He's a big fan of yours fucker.

1121
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:05,540
About hell,
but now we just stopped.

1122
00:49:05,570 --> 00:49:09,090
Just ripping out fuckers a good thing in
America.

1123
00:49:09,091 --> 00:49:10,920
We call each other fuckers all the time.
Yeah.

1124
00:49:10,921 --> 00:49:13,290
It's like a blue in Scotland would be 
like,

1125
00:49:13,291 --> 00:49:14,700
he's a good cop.
He's a good con.

1126
00:49:14,750 --> 00:49:15,470
Yeah.
Uh,

1127
00:49:15,570 --> 00:49:16,080
but,
uh,

1128
00:49:16,081 --> 00:49:21,081
we were talking about how like,
you're not allowed anymore to have any 

1129
00:49:21,081 --> 00:49:24,861
feelings as a white man that had 
anything other than guilt about being a 

1130
00:49:24,861 --> 00:49:25,830
white man.
Well,

1131
00:49:25,860 --> 00:49:27,200
firstly,
acknowledge your privilege.

1132
00:49:28,610 --> 00:49:29,040
Privilege,

1133
00:49:29,620 --> 00:49:34,620
your white privilege before you even 
talk about what white people that's 

1134
00:49:34,620 --> 00:49:34,620
foreign aren't around.

1135
00:49:34,620 --> 00:49:37,130
What about his gender?
People of color.

1136
00:49:37,610 --> 00:49:38,720
Okay.
Uh,

1137
00:49:38,910 --> 00:49:43,910
I was just listening.
I was just listening to a,

1138
00:49:44,370 --> 00:49:45,230
you know,
Sam Harris,

1139
00:49:45,231 --> 00:49:45,920
right?
Yeah.

1140
00:49:45,921 --> 00:49:50,921
So it was just listening to the latest 
episode of his podcast where he's 

1141
00:49:50,921 --> 00:49:51,680
talking to this Guy Douglas Murray,
who's this English conservative,

1142
00:49:51,681 --> 00:49:53,180
and Douglas is saying that,
uh,

1143
00:49:53,570 --> 00:49:54,650
that when the,
when the,

1144
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:55,850
when the nuke.
Finally,

1145
00:49:55,851 --> 00:49:59,510
when the Jihadi nuke finally goes off,
what we're all going to be talking about

1146
00:49:59,511 --> 00:50:01,950
his transgender pronouns.
Right.

1147
00:50:02,090 --> 00:50:05,540
It's like that be the discussion about 
whether to called them.

1148
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:06,380
He,
she,

1149
00:50:06,381 --> 00:50:09,440
they was a at the point when like real 
shit's going down.

1150
00:50:09,441 --> 00:50:14,441
Like we're so distracted by so many 
little semi little cultural pieces of 

1151
00:50:14,441 --> 00:50:16,970
bullshit at the moment.
We're losing sight of the big picture.

1152
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:20,100
I think it's because it's too easy to 
get by these people that are looking.

1153
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:21,380
I think again,
it's.

1154
00:50:21,650 --> 00:50:26,650
It's very easy to live today,
much easier than it has been in an 

1155
00:50:26,650 --> 00:50:31,380
important time and I think also it's 
very easy to communicate today much more

1156
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:35,060
easy than it has been at any other point
in time and before.

1157
00:50:35,690 --> 00:50:38,660
Before this era,
the era of instant communication,

1158
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:43,960
if you had an idea,
it had to be really good to get it out 

1159
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:44,060
there to the masses.
It had to be really good.

1160
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:48,470
It had to go through editors and 
publicists that had to go to publishers.

1161
00:50:48,471 --> 00:50:51,020
They had to print it.
People had to read it and recommend it.

1162
00:50:51,140 --> 00:50:53,750
It had to be verified.
It had to be excellent.

1163
00:50:53,850 --> 00:50:54,890
You know,
if you were a hunter,

1164
00:50:54,891 --> 00:50:57,500
s Thompson,
like there was a lot of jumps.

1165
00:50:57,560 --> 00:51:02,560
You had to go through lots of hoops,
a lot of ladders he had to climb before 

1166
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:02,810
you can publish,
you know,

1167
00:51:02,811 --> 00:51:07,811
a fear and loathing in Las Vegas today.
Any fucking dipshit can start a hashtag 

1168
00:51:09,170 --> 00:51:10,940
activist,
you know,

1169
00:51:11,750 --> 00:51:16,750
some sort of a.
You could start a tumbler blog or 

1170
00:51:16,750 --> 00:51:20,051
anything and that it can immediately be 
picked up by also by people that also 

1171
00:51:20,051 --> 00:51:23,741
want to be outraged and they'll go on 
this goddamn rampage and it's confusing 

1172
00:51:23,741 --> 00:51:25,820
as fuck.
It's because it's so easy to get by.

1173
00:51:25,821 --> 00:51:26,550
It's we,
we were,

1174
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:30,320
we were like spoiled rich kids in a way.
Spoiled,

1175
00:51:30,350 --> 00:51:35,350
spoiled,
rich kids with our ability to 

1176
00:51:35,350 --> 00:51:35,350
communicate ideas.

1177
00:51:35,350 --> 00:51:37,950
I mean,
I think the lowering of the barriers is 

1178
00:51:37,950 --> 00:51:37,950
a good thing and a bad thing,
right?

1179
00:51:37,950 --> 00:51:38,320
I mean the,
the flattening and the fact that I don't

1180
00:51:38,321 --> 00:51:43,321
have to go and talk to a network 
executive or radio station owner about 

1181
00:51:43,321 --> 00:51:44,410
doing my podcast.
I can just do the show that I want to do

1182
00:51:44,411 --> 00:51:49,411
and put it out there is great,
but you're right that like we've become 

1183
00:51:49,411 --> 00:51:53,160
the Douglas Murray.
There's this British conservative 

1184
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:55,090
columnist was saying he thinks that the 
problem is that there's a lack of.

1185
00:51:55,150 --> 00:52:00,150
There's a,
there's a supply and demand problem 

1186
00:52:00,150 --> 00:52:02,220
between social justice warriors and like
racists because there aren't enough 

1187
00:52:03,011 --> 00:52:04,660
racist anymore.
Right?

1188
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:09,840
So like the left used to be agitated by 
fighting all of these big good noble 

1189
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:11,350
fights,
but the like the fascists and the rice,

1190
00:52:11,351 --> 00:52:16,351
it's an older people who they wanted to 
bring down have basically been 

1191
00:52:16,351 --> 00:52:16,351
vanquished.

1192
00:52:16,351 --> 00:52:17,830
So now they're not totally,
but now they have to talk.

1193
00:52:17,860 --> 00:52:19,900
Now I have to accuse people like me of 
being racist.

1194
00:52:19,901 --> 00:52:24,901
I was accused of being racist the other 
day because I used the phrase to call a 

1195
00:52:24,901 --> 00:52:25,180
spade a spade.
Whoa.

1196
00:52:25,270 --> 00:52:29,110
And in the 1920 you got called a racist 
for that yet in Harlem,

1197
00:52:29,111 --> 00:52:31,930
in the 19 twenties a spade was a bad 
word for black people,

1198
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:34,690
not just the 19 twenties.
So that's like pretty recently.

1199
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:36,940
Was it because not in,
not in Australian language.

1200
00:52:36,941 --> 00:52:40,540
So even in like the seventies and the 
eighties,

1201
00:52:40,541 --> 00:52:43,540
people would use it a disparaging the 
spades.

1202
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:45,040
Okay.
So I'd never heard it,

1203
00:52:45,041 --> 00:52:50,041
but apparently on racist now.
So because there aren't enough actual 

1204
00:52:50,041 --> 00:52:51,550
racists to keep shouting it,
so they have to stop shouting it.

1205
00:52:51,551 --> 00:52:53,950
But it's a spade a spade is a card term.
Yeah,

1206
00:52:53,951 --> 00:52:54,370
that's right.

1207
00:52:54,540 --> 00:52:57,600
It's a term about playing cards to call 
a spade a spade.

1208
00:52:57,601 --> 00:53:02,220
It's like a club or a spade or a heart 
like that is so fucking stupid.

1209
00:53:02,510 --> 00:53:07,510
I see.
And also I posted something on facebook 

1210
00:53:07,510 --> 00:53:08,120
about did you see the Brouhaha about 
Meryl Streep's tee shirt,

1211
00:53:08,270 --> 00:53:13,270
you know,
so she's just finished shooting a movie 

1212
00:53:13,270 --> 00:53:14,780
in London called suffragette way in 
which she plays Emily Pankhurst,

1213
00:53:14,781 --> 00:53:17,280
who was one of the great women's rights,
uh,

1214
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:22,820
you know,
campaigners back in the late 18 

1215
00:53:22,820 --> 00:53:22,820
hundreds,
early 19 hundreds.

1216
00:53:22,820 --> 00:53:24,920
It's about the birth of the feminism 
movement.

1217
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:30,160
And in 1913 pancoast gave this speech,
his famous speech for,

1218
00:53:30,161 --> 00:53:33,600
for women's rights in which he said that
the women's rights movement will survive

1219
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:37,830
so long as there is a woman alive to 
hold up the flag of rebellion.

1220
00:53:38,010 --> 00:53:43,010
I would rather be a rebel and a slave.
So they do this promotional thing in 

1221
00:53:43,010 --> 00:53:45,480
which his meryl streep a wearing a tee 
shirt.

1222
00:53:45,510 --> 00:53:50,510
I'd rather be a rebel in a slave,
meaning I'd rather fight for my rights 

1223
00:53:51,820 --> 00:53:55,500
then be downtrodden as a woman in the 
early part of the 20th century.

1224
00:53:55,920 --> 00:54:00,920
Well,
the Internet blew up with how racist 

1225
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:02,430
Merrill is because she's not 
understanding the context of that.

1226
00:54:02,431 --> 00:54:03,270
I mean there.
Uh,

1227
00:54:03,510 --> 00:54:06,330
and then so I put a suit or like,
here are some of the tweets.

1228
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:08,910
I can't believe this is real.
This is real.

1229
00:54:08,911 --> 00:54:13,911
Someone said with a link to it that the 
word rebel is juxtaposed with slave in 

1230
00:54:13,911 --> 00:54:14,190
that quote,
just,

1231
00:54:14,220 --> 00:54:19,220
I can't fathom this.
Someone else says then someone else 

1232
00:54:19,220 --> 00:54:19,220
tries to school.
I'm says,

1233
00:54:19,220 --> 00:54:20,790
the quote is from Emily Pankhurst who 
said it in 1913,

1234
00:54:20,791 --> 00:54:25,791
Rally for women's rights to which the 
social justice warriors respond and I'm 

1235
00:54:25,791 --> 00:54:26,460
letting you know that it doesn't matter 
who said it,

1236
00:54:26,461 --> 00:54:31,461
the quote is trash and another person,
white women have said a lot of terrible 

1237
00:54:31,461 --> 00:54:34,761
things over the course of history.
It doesn't mean you wear it on a shirt 

1238
00:54:34,761 --> 00:54:34,761
and it just goes on and on.

1239
00:54:34,761 --> 00:54:39,560
And I put it on facebook and just said,
I'm glad that we're focusing on what's 

1240
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:41,100
really important.
And like a black friend of mine said,

1241
00:54:41,150 --> 00:54:46,150
you know,
just started attacking me for being an 

1242
00:54:46,150 --> 00:54:46,150
apologist for racism.
Black friend of yours,

1243
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:48,510
who would black friend is this.
Well,

1244
00:54:48,630 --> 00:54:50,280
I'm going to name him.
We don't have to name them,

1245
00:54:50,281 --> 00:54:53,340
but fuck him.
He knows you're not racist.

1246
00:54:53,341 --> 00:54:55,740
That's stupid.
This is damn it.

1247
00:54:55,890 --> 00:54:58,110
The problem is there's not enough 
problems.

1248
00:54:58,280 --> 00:55:00,570
That's kind of what I made about supply 
and demand thing,

1249
00:55:00,571 --> 00:55:05,571
right.
There's not enough actual problems for 

1250
00:55:05,571 --> 00:55:05,571
them to focus on.
So like,

1251
00:55:05,571 --> 00:55:05,571
so no.
I think what I said,

1252
00:55:05,571 --> 00:55:09,740
what I wrote on facebook was political 
correctness is exhausting and he wrote 

1253
00:55:09,740 --> 00:55:10,990
being black as exhausting.
Okay.

1254
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:12,680
And I.
Yeah.

1255
00:55:12,870 --> 00:55:14,520
And I wrote,
right?

1256
00:55:15,210 --> 00:55:18,450
Fortunately that tee shirt has nothing 
to do with being black.

1257
00:55:19,410 --> 00:55:22,680
And then he went off onto this thing 
about how like everything,

1258
00:55:22,681 --> 00:55:27,681
you know,
people that you have to understand how 

1259
00:55:27,681 --> 00:55:29,271
other people are gonna perceive things 
and you will have to be cognizant of 

1260
00:55:29,271 --> 00:55:32,091
always using the right words and it just
ends up spiraling down into this 

1261
00:55:32,091 --> 00:55:35,280
situation where all of a sudden I have 
to be censoring every single word that I

1262
00:55:35,281 --> 00:55:40,281
say in case some idiot misinterprets it 
and doesn't understand the historical 

1263
00:55:40,281 --> 00:55:40,770
context that we're talking about.

1264
00:55:40,770 --> 00:55:45,770
The women's movement in like early 20th 
century Britain and not the fight 

1265
00:55:45,901 --> 00:55:48,100
against slavery in America,
like buy it,

1266
00:55:48,190 --> 00:55:53,190
don't buy it.
I don't think people really offended by 

1267
00:55:53,190 --> 00:55:53,190
it.
I think it's a green light issue.

1268
00:55:53,190 --> 00:55:56,511
I think it's agreed.
They look at Meryl Streep and that t 

1269
00:55:56,511 --> 00:55:56,670
shirt and if they understand the context
of what she's trying to say,

1270
00:55:56,820 --> 00:56:01,820
like if you.
If you quote the original piece that it 

1271
00:56:01,820 --> 00:56:05,121
was taken from [inaudible],
they still have a problem with that 

1272
00:56:05,121 --> 00:56:06,950
they're doing is just finding a 
greenlight green light.

1273
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:09,360
Like that's.
I can go hit the gas.

1274
00:56:09,361 --> 00:56:10,260
Yeah,
that's what it is.

1275
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:11,190
Yeah.
That's all it is.

1276
00:56:11,220 --> 00:56:12,880
It doesn't make any sense.
When she's.

1277
00:56:12,910 --> 00:56:17,910
She's posting something or she has a a t
shirt on rather that's taken from a 

1278
00:56:18,270 --> 00:56:20,280
historical quote.
It's really simple.

1279
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:24,130
If you have an issue with those words 
because those words can be used in other

1280
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:25,990
forms.
Well that's your issue.

1281
00:56:26,110 --> 00:56:31,110
It's your turn to make a big deal of it 
and that you have to be more aware and 

1282
00:56:31,110 --> 00:56:32,560
you have to be because being black is 
exhausting or being Chinese.

1283
00:56:32,561 --> 00:56:37,561
We built the railroads for you to ride 
that railroad and not acknowledged the 

1284
00:56:37,561 --> 00:56:40,411
fact that Chinese people died during the
making of that real fucking Christ 

1285
00:56:40,411 --> 00:56:44,050
enough that what we need is wolves.
We need wolves at the gates.

1286
00:56:44,230 --> 00:56:47,140
What we need is a fucking winter.
We need winter's coming.

1287
00:56:47,141 --> 00:56:50,100
We need to fucking black,
but we've,

1288
00:56:50,130 --> 00:56:53,230
we've just had Paris,
the Paris attacks.

1289
00:56:53,580 --> 00:56:56,590
Let's focus or in Paris.
I bet it's like that,

1290
00:56:56,710 --> 00:57:01,710
you know,
nine slash 11 and after September 11th 

1291
00:57:01,710 --> 00:57:05,101
in New York,
New York was fucking amazing and I hate 

1292
00:57:05,101 --> 00:57:08,551
to say this and it turns like this is 
not minimizing the victims or the 

1293
00:57:08,551 --> 00:57:10,630
families of the victims and horrible 
tragedy without a doubt.

1294
00:57:10,630 --> 00:57:12,190
No one,
no one's denying that,

1295
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:15,490
but what I'm saying is we were in New 
York City,

1296
00:57:15,491 --> 00:57:20,491
me and some friends when we were filming
fear factor and it was about 10 months 

1297
00:57:20,621 --> 00:57:24,520
or 11 months after nine slash 11.
My memory might be bad,

1298
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:28,990
but the point being people were 
noticeably more friendly,

1299
00:57:29,260 --> 00:57:33,220
noticeably more,
more like they were engaging.

1300
00:57:33,490 --> 00:57:36,220
They would say hi to each other.
The firemen came.

1301
00:57:36,221 --> 00:57:38,980
I had a friend who blacked out because I
gave her some California weed.

1302
00:57:39,690 --> 00:57:40,190
We were,
uh,

1303
00:57:40,530 --> 00:57:45,530
were hanging out in front of this bar.
It was all these people that work for 

1304
00:57:45,530 --> 00:57:45,530
fear factor and uh,
you know,

1305
00:57:45,530 --> 00:57:47,080
and uh,
I busted out Joanna go,

1306
00:57:47,081 --> 00:57:48,880
you guys want to get down or why?
What do you want to do?

1307
00:57:48,940 --> 00:57:51,190
Come on pussies and these,
all these producers,

1308
00:57:51,191 --> 00:57:51,670
they're like,
okay,

1309
00:57:51,671 --> 00:57:52,180
okay,
we'll try.

1310
00:57:52,270 --> 00:57:53,980
We'll try some.
This is fucking space.

1311
00:57:53,980 --> 00:57:56,740
We'd just the deepest,
blackest whole space we'd,

1312
00:57:56,741 --> 00:58:01,741
right.
She takes a deep pit and you see her 

1313
00:58:01,741 --> 00:58:01,810
eyes start to flutter and roll behind 
her head.

1314
00:58:02,050 --> 00:58:07,050
And Luckily I was in a position to catch
her and I moved in and we grabbed her as

1315
00:58:07,901 --> 00:58:12,901
she was like,
she was literally just blacking out on 

1316
00:58:12,901 --> 00:58:12,901
the concrete.
That's some serious shit,

1317
00:58:12,901 --> 00:58:17,590
serious weed.
But it's apparently it can happen to 

1318
00:58:17,590 --> 00:58:18,310
certain people if you don't smoke a lot 
of weed.

1319
00:58:18,311 --> 00:58:19,300
And she just decided,
fuck it,

1320
00:58:19,301 --> 00:58:22,810
let's give it a shot.
Just took a big hit and you see her eyes

1321
00:58:22,811 --> 00:58:24,910
fluttering and she just gave.
So we called the fireman.

1322
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:30,600
The fireman came and it was like,
like a nobleman on a knight on a horse 

1323
00:58:31,151 --> 00:58:36,151
had arrived.
Everybody was so happy to see the 

1324
00:58:36,151 --> 00:58:36,190
firemen.
First responders got so much love.

1325
00:58:36,370 --> 00:58:41,370
It was amazing.
It wasn't hundreds of colleagues had 

1326
00:58:41,370 --> 00:58:41,370
just died.

1327
00:58:41,370 --> 00:58:43,600
It was also the fact that people 
recognize the importance of having first

1328
00:58:43,601 --> 00:58:48,601
responders having farm and having 
policemen and that they really felt it 

1329
00:58:48,601 --> 00:58:49,090
like in a deep real way.
Like,

1330
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:51,100
thank you.
Thank you for what you do.

1331
00:58:51,101 --> 00:58:52,750
If it wasn't for what you,
you do,

1332
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:55,190
we will be so much more danger.
You're like,

1333
00:58:55,370 --> 00:59:00,370
it's having a very real memory of them 
stepping in and risking their lives and 

1334
00:59:01,301 --> 00:59:06,301
helping people and seeing them covered 
with dust as they carried people out of 

1335
00:59:06,301 --> 00:59:06,540
the buildings.
And we,

1336
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:07,310
we,
we,

1337
00:59:07,311 --> 00:59:07,750
we,
we,

1338
00:59:07,751 --> 00:59:10,300
it was like,
it was solidified and people's memories.

1339
00:59:10,420 --> 00:59:15,420
And then over the past decade or so you 
go back and it's back to being New York 

1340
00:59:15,521 --> 00:59:17,380
again.
People don't look at each other.

1341
00:59:17,381 --> 00:59:18,670
Fuck you.
Like there was,

1342
00:59:18,730 --> 00:59:22,490
there was a feeling of vulnerability 
that existed because we had recognized a

1343
00:59:22,491 --> 00:59:25,480
real problem and we had gone through a 
real uh,

1344
00:59:25,540 --> 00:59:29,570
but they had gone through a real moment 
of intense adversity.

1345
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:31,120
Did you do,

1346
00:59:31,340 --> 00:59:36,340
did you see in the wake of Paris,
one of the things that I found 

1347
00:59:36,340 --> 00:59:38,030
interesting was this conversation around
tragedy,

1348
00:59:38,031 --> 00:59:38,880
hipster,
trap,

1349
00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:39,770
tragedy,
hipsters.

1350
00:59:39,771 --> 00:59:44,771
Did you hear about the hipster tragedy?
Hipster is someone who the moment 

1351
00:59:44,771 --> 00:59:45,170
something like the Paris attacks 
happens,

1352
00:59:45,740 --> 00:59:50,740
a start shitting on people who are 
pouring out sympathy online or changing 

1353
00:59:50,740 --> 00:59:54,821
their face,
their facebook profile pictures to the 

1354
00:59:54,821 --> 00:59:54,821
French flag or something by saying,
well,

1355
00:59:54,821 --> 00:59:59,231
where will you,
why weren't you out route outrage when 

1356
00:59:59,231 --> 00:59:59,231
there was a roof like,
this is like this.

1357
00:59:59,231 --> 01:00:00,320
I've got an article here in the 
stranger,

1358
01:00:00,350 --> 01:00:05,350
which is the Seattle blog,
entitled why putting the French flag on 

1359
01:00:05,350 --> 01:00:05,960
the space needle is racist?

1360
01:00:07,190 --> 01:00:12,120
What by Charles Modality?
It's November 16.

1361
01:00:12,150 --> 01:00:14,880
Why didn't anybody acknowledged the 
attacks in Lebanon?

1362
01:00:14,881 --> 01:00:17,520
Why didn't anybody acknowledge the 
attacks in Nigeria?

1363
01:00:17,521 --> 01:00:18,590
That was the point is,
well,

1364
01:00:18,690 --> 01:00:22,740
there's a real racist aspect to that and
I think there's a real argument for.

1365
01:00:23,300 --> 01:00:28,300
So I figured,
I think we have to be allowed to allow 

1366
01:00:28,300 --> 01:00:29,490
people to express sympathy.
Yes.

1367
01:00:29,770 --> 01:00:34,770
Uh,
I also find it a bit fatuous when 

1368
01:00:34,770 --> 01:00:34,770
everyone starts pouring out,
you know,

1369
01:00:34,770 --> 01:00:35,370
all of it.
There were certain fashionable things to

1370
01:00:35,371 --> 01:00:36,090
care about,
you know,

1371
01:00:36,091 --> 01:00:41,091
it's a bit like the Kony 2012 phenomenon
or something where all of a sudden 

1372
01:00:41,091 --> 01:00:42,990
everyone just jumps on some social 
media,

1373
01:00:42,991 --> 01:00:47,991
Social Justice Bandwagon.
But I feel like Paris is a bit 

1374
01:00:47,991 --> 01:00:47,991
different.
Yes.

1375
01:00:47,991 --> 01:00:49,530
People should pay attention to Beirut.
Yes.

1376
01:00:49,531 --> 01:00:51,780
People should pay attention to Nigeria 
and Boca.

1377
01:00:51,781 --> 01:00:52,590
Harambe,
yes.

1378
01:00:52,591 --> 01:00:54,570
People should be more aware of what's 
going on.

1379
01:00:54,571 --> 01:00:57,630
But as a Bama said in the wake of the 
Paris attacks,

1380
01:00:57,631 --> 01:01:01,890
it is understandable for people to have 
a more instinctive,

1381
01:01:01,891 --> 01:01:06,891
sympathetic reaction to a city that they
know the city that they've been to a 

1382
01:01:06,891 --> 01:01:10,200
city populated by people like them who 
are doing things just like them going to

1383
01:01:10,201 --> 01:01:12,120
see a soccer game sitting in a 
restaurant.

1384
01:01:12,680 --> 01:01:15,540
Um,
then they offer parts of the world where

1385
01:01:15,541 --> 01:01:17,480
they think that violence is more 
commonplace.

1386
01:01:17,610 --> 01:01:22,610
Like Nigeria,
I don't think you can be belittling 

1387
01:01:22,610 --> 01:01:24,330
people for genuine expressions of 
sympathy.

1388
01:01:24,450 --> 01:01:26,850
I certainly don't think that you should 
be accusing them of being racist.

1389
01:01:26,910 --> 01:01:31,910
I agree with you wholeheartedly.
I don't think you should accuse people 

1390
01:01:31,910 --> 01:01:32,700
of anything negative for expressing 
sympathy,

1391
01:01:32,940 --> 01:01:37,940
but I think that culturally when you 
look at the news and when you look at 

1392
01:01:37,940 --> 01:01:42,051
CNN and the people that are supposed to 
be responsible for letting us know 

1393
01:01:42,051 --> 01:01:44,610
what's happening in the world,
that's where the issue lies.

1394
01:01:44,670 --> 01:01:47,400
Like why are they concentrating solely 
on Paris?

1395
01:01:47,401 --> 01:01:51,600
Why doesn't CNN have all this coverage 
of Lebanon in Nigeria that,

1396
01:01:51,820 --> 01:01:56,130
that mirrors it.
So you get this broad perspective of the

1397
01:01:56,490 --> 01:01:58,850
actual world itself and say,
look,

1398
01:01:58,890 --> 01:02:03,890
this,
this isis issue is not just an issue 

1399
01:02:03,890 --> 01:02:06,530
that happened to Europeans.
This is an issue that's been happening 

1400
01:02:06,530 --> 01:02:07,790
all over the world for awhile now.
Absolutely.

1401
01:02:07,850 --> 01:02:10,560
And CNN is fucking awful.
I'm definitely not going to defense,

1402
01:02:10,570 --> 01:02:11,160
can it?
I mean,

1403
01:02:11,210 --> 01:02:16,210
CNN is the worst example I think,
of just following the most predictable 

1404
01:02:16,210 --> 01:02:18,440
line on everything.
They try not to alienate anyone by being

1405
01:02:18,441 --> 01:02:23,441
too left or too right and as a 
consequence they just a mush of 

1406
01:02:23,441 --> 01:02:23,441
ignorance and like parochialism

1407
01:02:23,441 --> 01:02:25,370
do you do?
If you are Jeff Zucker,

1408
01:02:25,371 --> 01:02:27,740
if you're the guy who runs cnn,
what the fuck do you do?

1409
01:02:27,741 --> 01:02:30,200
But you put Anthony Bourdain show on.
That's a good move.

1410
01:02:30,530 --> 01:02:31,490
Well,
what else do you do?

1411
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:36,500
I mean how the fuck do you.
Do you cover the news and like a broad 

1412
01:02:37,730 --> 01:02:41,590
way and also make it a profitable 
entertainment enterprise,

1413
01:02:41,591 --> 01:02:42,050
which is what

1414
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:47,200
I would like to think that there's a 
market for smart conversations about 

1415
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:50,831
things,
which is what I try to do at huffpost 

1416
01:02:50,831 --> 01:02:52,630
live and we don't get small numbers.
I mean things oftentimes I'm surprised 

1417
01:02:52,630 --> 01:02:57,221
when I have a smart conversation about 
the relationship between Islamism to 

1418
01:02:57,221 --> 01:03:00,881
Islam and the plight of poor Muslims in 
the suburbs of European capitals where 

1419
01:03:02,091 --> 01:03:07,091
unemployment is 35 percent and the 
demographics of the types of people in 

1420
01:03:07,091 --> 01:03:11,741
Iraq who are joining isis who were 14 
years old during the US invasion and 

1421
01:03:11,741 --> 01:03:15,580
have just endured all of the rest of 
their lives basically being full of 

1422
01:03:15,580 --> 01:03:20,561
civil war and people being beheaded and 
strung up in the streets and who hated 

1423
01:03:20,561 --> 01:03:24,161
Saddam,
but hate America and hate the West now 

1424
01:03:24,161 --> 01:03:24,161
for everything that they've been 
through.

1425
01:03:24,161 --> 01:03:25,430
Like when we talk about a lot sort of 
stuff,

1426
01:03:25,970 --> 01:03:27,380
some people are actually,
you know,

1427
01:03:27,530 --> 01:03:32,530
significant numbers of people were 
actually interested in hearing about it 

1428
01:03:32,530 --> 01:03:34,871
instead of meanwhile on CNN should the 
mayor of this city and in the midwest 

1429
01:03:35,601 --> 01:03:39,170
that has a majority Muslim population be
afraid,

1430
01:03:39,250 --> 01:03:40,600
how can we can do that?
So good,

1431
01:03:40,601 --> 01:03:43,450
but you can't do a rush.
That was a total American accent.

1432
01:03:44,620 --> 01:03:45,350
No,
you're right.

1433
01:03:45,370 --> 01:03:46,120
I can.
You know,

1434
01:03:46,210 --> 01:03:51,210
it's.
People are problematic and it's very 

1435
01:03:51,210 --> 01:03:53,200
difficult for people to separate their 
motives from,

1436
01:03:53,260 --> 01:03:56,890
from the reality of the situation that 
they're reporting on to.

1437
01:03:56,950 --> 01:04:01,950
Also,
you're dealing with commercial 

1438
01:04:01,950 --> 01:04:01,950
interests.
You know,

1439
01:04:01,950 --> 01:04:02,500
you have advertisers,
you have all these different things that

1440
01:04:02,501 --> 01:04:06,010
have a say or at least an influence on 
what gets said.

1441
01:04:06,040 --> 01:04:11,040
Whereas you don't have that.
There's also the difference between 

1442
01:04:11,040 --> 01:04:13,090
broadcast and selective media.
Your,

1443
01:04:13,180 --> 01:04:18,180
your.
You have a selective media outlet which 

1444
01:04:18,180 --> 01:04:20,941
means someone finds out about Josh Zaps 
from one of your many wonderful 

1445
01:04:20,941 --> 01:04:24,541
appearances all throughout the world and
huff post live and all these different 

1446
01:04:24,541 --> 01:04:24,541
things.
They get to know you.

1447
01:04:24,541 --> 01:04:25,540
I like this guy's perspective.
He's very intelligent.

1448
01:04:25,541 --> 01:04:30,541
He's very articulate and then they seek 
you out and they find your thing to 

1449
01:04:30,541 --> 01:04:32,380
subscribe to it and then they go to it 
because they becoming a josh eps fan.

1450
01:04:32,800 --> 01:04:36,610
Whereas CNN is at the fucking airport,
you know,

1451
01:04:36,611 --> 01:04:39,300
I'm waiting for my flight the other day 
and they have CNN and they're.

1452
01:04:39,301 --> 01:04:43,270
They're showing these people doing these
things and it's just.

1453
01:04:43,271 --> 01:04:48,271
It's on.
There's a difference between something 

1454
01:04:48,271 --> 01:04:51,271
that's broadcast and something that you 
select and I think when someone gets 

1455
01:04:51,271 --> 01:04:55,600
excited about something like what you do
is someone who has chosen to go seek out

1456
01:04:55,601 --> 01:05:00,601
your perspective and your point of view 
or it's very difficult to do that on a 

1457
01:05:00,601 --> 01:05:02,800
show like CNN or a network like CNN.

1458
01:05:02,870 --> 01:05:04,740
We have to be able to do better than we 
are.

1459
01:05:04,890 --> 01:05:09,890
It like 60 minutes for all of its faults
occasionally hits the nail on the head 

1460
01:05:09,890 --> 01:05:12,770
and does a good job and certainly used 
to and people watch it and watched it.

1461
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:15,950
Still cronkite used to direct John that 
there are good.

1462
01:05:16,310 --> 01:05:18,010
PBS does a does a great job.

1463
01:05:18,340 --> 01:05:23,340
Broadly.
I think NBC news does a great job just 

1464
01:05:23,340 --> 01:05:25,891
as a CCO as a whole collection.
So Williams with the exception of Brian 

1465
01:05:25,891 --> 01:05:26,090
Williams.
Although I mean like,

1466
01:05:26,710 --> 01:05:29,050
who gives a fuck?
Yeah,

1467
01:05:29,140 --> 01:05:30,640
exactly.
I never be a robot.

1468
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:32,140
A robot.
That's right.

1469
01:05:32,141 --> 01:05:34,600
Who gives a shit what he's to do his 
job.

1470
01:05:34,630 --> 01:05:37,570
That's what they should do exist.
You just have a fucking laptop there,

1471
01:05:37,630 --> 01:05:42,630
but he is on your.
On your point about what people are 

1472
01:05:42,630 --> 01:05:45,130
gonna Watch and seek out,
there's a good piece in vox by Max 

1473
01:05:45,130 --> 01:05:46,720
Fisher after the all the criticism of 
like why didn't,

1474
01:05:46,990 --> 01:05:49,390
why didn't the media cover the Beirut 
bombings?

1475
01:05:49,540 --> 01:05:52,780
Because like one of the most popular,
one of the most retweeted tweets the day

1476
01:05:52,781 --> 01:05:57,781
after the Paris attacks was a tweet 
about why is the media covering this so 

1477
01:05:58,001 --> 01:06:01,600
much when they didn't cover Beirut?
And uh,

1478
01:06:01,980 --> 01:06:06,190
so Max Fisher says we did and nobody 
clicks on it.

1479
01:06:07,450 --> 01:06:09,440
We do.
And nobody ever clicks on it,

1480
01:06:10,580 --> 01:06:15,310
clicks at it or no one clicks on it.
Then they just let it go and they just,

1481
01:06:15,900 --> 01:06:20,900
at some point you have to at some point,
if you're interested in having a 

1482
01:06:20,900 --> 01:06:24,570
thriving media business,
you have to give people what they 

1483
01:06:24,570 --> 01:06:24,570
actually want,
which is judged by what they click on.

1484
01:06:24,570 --> 01:06:28,640
So,
so they put Beirut at the very top of 

1485
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:30,931
the page and then you know,
what you get doesn't even register as a 

1486
01:06:30,931 --> 01:06:35,071
blip on the number of clicks.
So then they downgrade it and then it 

1487
01:06:35,071 --> 01:06:35,071
ends up falling back onto the world 
section of the site.

1488
01:06:35,071 --> 01:06:39,420
But I think you just nailed it because 
it's a business and that's where it 

1489
01:06:39,420 --> 01:06:42,151
becomes a problem and that becomes a 
problem is that it's an entertainment 

1490
01:06:42,151 --> 01:06:44,140
business.
Like CNN is an entertainment network.

1491
01:06:44,180 --> 01:06:44,970
Yeah.
But they,

1492
01:06:45,060 --> 01:06:50,060
they,
they entertain you by showing you the 

1493
01:06:50,060 --> 01:06:50,060
real reality TV,
which is the news,

1494
01:06:50,060 --> 01:06:51,720
but much like reality tv,
you know,

1495
01:06:51,730 --> 01:06:54,150
if you live in a house with a bunch of 
people and they,

1496
01:06:54,380 --> 01:06:59,380
they filmed six hours a day and then 
they water it down to 44 minutes on 

1497
01:06:59,380 --> 01:07:00,640
television or 22 minutes on television.

1498
01:07:01,030 --> 01:07:02,620
When they do that,
then they're gonna.

1499
01:07:02,650 --> 01:07:04,300
They're gonna do it the way they want to
show it.

1500
01:07:04,301 --> 01:07:09,301
They're going to chop out a bunch of 
other shit that you're not really 

1501
01:07:09,301 --> 01:07:11,671
interested in.
And they're gonna paint a picture and 

1502
01:07:11,671 --> 01:07:12,490
they can edit it and paint that picture 
and a variety of different ways.

1503
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:17,760
But they're going to do it in a way that
they think is going to be the most 

1504
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:19,741
salacious.
It's gonna be the most compelling for 

1505
01:07:19,741 --> 01:07:19,780
you to tune in so they can sell you a 
Toyota truck so they can,

1506
01:07:19,781 --> 01:07:22,870
you know,
advertise tide laundry detergent.

1507
01:07:22,900 --> 01:07:24,400
You know,
that's really what it's all about.

1508
01:07:24,401 --> 01:07:26,220
Exactly.
And I think that's,

1509
01:07:26,310 --> 01:07:31,310
that's a real problem when you combine 
commerce with the dissemination of 

1510
01:07:31,310 --> 01:07:31,630
information.
Oh,

1511
01:07:31,631 --> 01:07:32,650
he was,
he is the tweet.

1512
01:07:32,651 --> 01:07:34,330
By the way,
Jack Jones TV,

1513
01:07:34,970 --> 01:07:36,970
uh,
has a picture of an explosion in Beirut.

1514
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:42,000
No media has covered this,
but rip to older people that lost their 

1515
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:43,030
lives in Lebanon yesterday from Isis 
attacks.

1516
01:07:43,030 --> 01:07:46,090
Let's see how many retweets.
So it's got that,

1517
01:07:46,420 --> 01:07:47,270
that's been reached.
Twenty,

1518
01:07:47,300 --> 01:07:50,680
57,750
times and like 43,000.

1519
01:07:50,681 --> 01:07:55,681
One hundred and two times.
The picture is not from the bay route 

1520
01:07:55,681 --> 01:07:58,861
attacks.
It's from 2006 during the Israeli war 

1521
01:07:58,861 --> 01:08:01,321
against Hezbollah.
And it's absolutely not true that no 

1522
01:08:01,321 --> 01:08:04,591
media has covered this.
The New York Times covered at the 

1523
01:08:04,591 --> 01:08:04,591
Washington Post,
the Ip,

1524
01:08:04,591 --> 01:08:06,490
a hue and Ella was sent to cover the 
blasts.

1525
01:08:06,520 --> 01:08:09,760
The economist had a piece on it,
CNN even seeing ended it,

1526
01:08:10,300 --> 01:08:15,300
the daily mail.
So that's a fake picture that's 

1527
01:08:15,300 --> 01:08:15,300
interested in.
That's right.

1528
01:08:15,300 --> 01:08:18,541
That's from nine years ago.
Long picture the picture that Angelina 

1529
01:08:18,541 --> 01:08:18,541
Jolie

1530
01:08:18,541 --> 01:08:19,690
tweeted too.
She tweeted it.

1531
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:20,620
Yeah.
Yeah.

1532
01:08:20,630 --> 01:08:22,820
She tweeted it about the Lebanon attacks
as well,

1533
01:08:22,940 --> 01:08:24,920
so get on the fucking ball.
Angelina,

1534
01:08:24,921 --> 01:08:26,820
stop adopting kids.
Those.

1535
01:08:27,250 --> 01:08:32,250
Those are the tragedy,
hipsters and investigated the veracity 

1536
01:08:32,250 --> 01:08:32,250
of the photographs.
You post young lady,

1537
01:08:32,250 --> 01:08:36,230
how dare she hashtag outraged.
I'm Hashtag [inaudible].

1538
01:08:36,270 --> 01:08:38,030
Hashtag racist.
How about that?

1539
01:08:40,050 --> 01:08:42,060
And now I don't know what to talk about.
About,

1540
01:08:42,310 --> 01:08:43,980
about,
about Islam as well.

1541
01:08:43,981 --> 01:08:48,300
Like the difficulty is what are you.
I'm afraid of all of the,

1542
01:08:48,390 --> 01:08:53,390
all of the right wing is taking.
My greatest fear about terrorism is that

1543
01:08:53,850 --> 01:08:58,850
we end up living in like a quasi fascist
state because we overreact so much that 

1544
01:08:58,850 --> 01:09:03,231
every,
like I got a little nephew who's two 

1545
01:09:03,231 --> 01:09:03,231
years old when he's 18 and he's 
traveling around the world like I did.

1546
01:09:03,231 --> 01:09:05,970
Is he going to be able to sit outside in
a cafe and,

1547
01:09:06,260 --> 01:09:11,260
and relax or is he gonna have to walk 
through a metal detector every bloody 

1548
01:09:11,260 --> 01:09:11,260
place.
He goes like,

1549
01:09:11,260 --> 01:09:11,730
it's a good question.
And is he gonna?

1550
01:09:11,731 --> 01:09:16,731
Is He gonna have any privacy or is the 
NSA going to spy on everything that he 

1551
01:09:16,731 --> 01:09:16,731
does?
And uh,

1552
01:09:16,731 --> 01:09:18,090
we're gonna let it because we're so 
afraid of having a text like this.

1553
01:09:18,330 --> 01:09:23,330
And is he going to live in a pluralistic
society or are we going to be so cowed 

1554
01:09:23,330 --> 01:09:24,210
either one way or the other way?
Either we,

1555
01:09:24,250 --> 01:09:27,900
we take out trump ID and oppress 
Muslims,

1556
01:09:27,901 --> 01:09:30,900
which only exacerbates the problem.
Or on the other hand,

1557
01:09:30,901 --> 01:09:33,090
we become social justice,
justice warriors who were like,

1558
01:09:33,091 --> 01:09:36,180
this has nothing to do with Islam.
Islam is a religion of peace.

1559
01:09:36,360 --> 01:09:41,360
There's nothing to see here.
You don't have to worry about the 

1560
01:09:41,360 --> 01:09:43,531
Islamists,
which means that we end up with mini 

1561
01:09:43,531 --> 01:09:45,561
theocracies in our own cities where you 
basically have a liberal communities 

1562
01:09:45,561 --> 01:09:46,990
that don't respect women's rights and 
don't respect gay rights,

1563
01:09:47,320 --> 01:09:47,670
you know,

1564
01:09:48,320 --> 01:09:51,550
don't respect but actively suppress.
Yeah.

1565
01:09:51,551 --> 01:09:53,050
I mean isis is throwing gay people

1566
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:54,010
bathrooms.
Yep.

1567
01:09:54,500 --> 01:09:59,500
Yeah.
And I don't know how we talk about this 

1568
01:09:59,500 --> 01:09:59,500
is the problem way.
And I by make,

1569
01:09:59,500 --> 01:10:03,791
by way I mean people like me who are 
broadly sympathetic to minority rights 

1570
01:10:04,071 --> 01:10:09,071
and who abroadly pro civil rights and 
want everybody to be able to live life 

1571
01:10:09,071 --> 01:10:11,900
however they want to.
And I'm pro high levels of immigration,

1572
01:10:11,990 --> 01:10:14,070
uh,
and I'm not intolerant,

1573
01:10:14,071 --> 01:10:19,071
I'm not as in a phobic,
I'm certainly not racist or 

1574
01:10:19,071 --> 01:10:21,881
Islamophobic,
but how do we talk honestly about the 

1575
01:10:21,881 --> 01:10:24,461
fact that at the fringes of Islam there 
is a big fucking problem and not yield 

1576
01:10:24,461 --> 01:10:26,460
that territory to the right wing because
you've got this,

1577
01:10:26,510 --> 01:10:28,980
the rise of these right wing.
Can you imagine if there was an election

1578
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,010
this election,
there is an election in Paris,

1579
01:10:31,011 --> 01:10:35,900
in France next week.
And how many more Paris is Paris attacks

1580
01:10:35,901 --> 01:10:38,450
would you have to have before the 
National Front,

1581
01:10:38,870 --> 01:10:42,680
the anti-immigrant racist party,
one pallet in Sweden.

1582
01:10:42,681 --> 01:10:47,681
Now the third largest party is a party 
that wants to close the borders 

1583
01:10:47,681 --> 01:10:48,020
completely.
Well,

1584
01:10:48,021 --> 01:10:53,021
I mean,
you practically already got that on the 

1585
01:10:53,021 --> 01:10:53,021
gop side here.
Well,

1586
01:10:53,021 --> 01:10:53,021
no,
not even.

1587
01:10:53,021 --> 01:10:53,021
Not even remotely.
Actually.

1588
01:10:53,021 --> 01:10:55,220
I take that back because they want to,
they want to close the illegal border,

1589
01:10:55,221 --> 01:10:58,130
but they still believe in having a 
moderate levels of.

1590
01:10:58,160 --> 01:10:58,790
Yeah,
exactly.

1591
01:10:59,180 --> 01:11:00,950
It's don't believe in having people like
me coming in.

1592
01:11:00,970 --> 01:11:02,530
Yes.
Yeah.

1593
01:11:02,570 --> 01:11:05,110
So how do people that speak well with a 
cool accent?

1594
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:08,020
Yeah.
You educated.

1595
01:11:08,021 --> 01:11:09,160
Sure.
Come on over,

1596
01:11:09,220 --> 01:11:11,080
probably more educated than we are.
Yeah.

1597
01:11:11,081 --> 01:11:16,081
I think what we have here is a human 
beings classically react to tragedies 

1598
01:11:17,610 --> 01:11:19,870
and massive events.
Uh,

1599
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:24,920
we have problems and then we have 
solutions and there's the solution is 

1600
01:11:24,920 --> 01:11:29,601
being debated and there's the extreme 
right wing answer to the solution to 

1601
01:11:29,601 --> 01:11:32,310
these problems which is close up.
The borders are more military,

1602
01:11:32,311 --> 01:11:34,530
more guns attack Isis.
Let's go to war.

1603
01:11:34,531 --> 01:11:35,580
Let's do this.
Let's do that.

1604
01:11:36,060 --> 01:11:41,060
I think we're also dealing with people 
like trump that are gigantic egos that 

1605
01:11:41,060 --> 01:11:45,120
have these platforms where they want to 
step up and they want to gather all this

1606
01:11:45,121 --> 01:11:49,380
attention to themselves and point to 
themselves as the solution to this issue

1607
01:11:49,381 --> 01:11:54,381
with their hotline stances.
And I think what's going to happen is 

1608
01:11:54,381 --> 01:11:58,980
technology as it becomes more and more 
pervasive and invasive,

1609
01:11:58,981 --> 01:12:03,981
and as we become more and more 
symbiotically connected to the ability 

1610
01:12:03,981 --> 01:12:05,700
to express ourselves through phones and 
through the Internet,

1611
01:12:06,060 --> 01:12:11,060
I think the next level of this is 
ultimately going to be some level that 

1612
01:12:11,060 --> 01:12:15,081
allows people to communicate in a way 
that it's not just typing things down 

1613
01:12:15,081 --> 01:12:16,500
and it's not just watching a video 
online.

1614
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:19,530
I think we're going to be able to 
communicate with each other in some sort

1615
01:12:19,531 --> 01:12:24,531
of a neural transmitting manner.
There's going to be some next step level

1616
01:12:25,501 --> 01:12:30,501
of technology with it,
whether it's a decade from now or two 

1617
01:12:30,501 --> 01:12:33,351
decades from now.
There's gonna be it's gonna seem 

1618
01:12:33,351 --> 01:12:35,090
pointless to have phones.
It's going to seem point.

1619
01:12:35,310 --> 01:12:40,310
The idea of having a physical thing when
you have to go to in order to access 

1620
01:12:40,310 --> 01:12:41,940
information is going to seem absolutely 
ridiculous.

1621
01:12:42,180 --> 01:12:45,690
And once that happens,
we're going to see what we see right now

1622
01:12:45,870 --> 01:12:50,190
in the world where I think w,
I think it's regardless of how crazy the

1623
01:12:50,191 --> 01:12:53,100
world is,
I think at least in America right now,

1624
01:12:53,310 --> 01:12:58,310
this is absolutely the safest time ever.
So when all this social justice warrior 

1625
01:12:58,441 --> 01:13:03,441
shit they were saying and all this 
craziness about outrage and Hashtag 

1626
01:13:03,441 --> 01:13:05,760
racism and Hashtag this and that,
it's bad,

1627
01:13:05,820 --> 01:13:06,510
but it's good.

1628
01:13:06,810 --> 01:13:09,270
It's good because it's all about 
sensitivity.

1629
01:13:09,271 --> 01:13:10,950
It's good because it's all about 
inclusion.

1630
01:13:10,951 --> 01:13:15,951
It's good because it's all about 
eliminating anything that's disparaging 

1631
01:13:15,951 --> 01:13:19,551
or racist or anything where you are 
marginalizing groups based on something 

1632
01:13:19,551 --> 01:13:22,530
that they can't control like what they 
look like or their sexual preference.

1633
01:13:22,710 --> 01:13:27,710
And I think as we get deeper and deeper 
to this interconnectivity that we're 

1634
01:13:28,501 --> 01:13:33,501
experiencing right now,
we're going to absolve a lot of our 

1635
01:13:33,501 --> 01:13:38,181
differences in grievances through our 
ability to communicate with each other 

1636
01:13:38,181 --> 01:13:39,840
and connect with each other.
And I think we're experiencing like this

1637
01:13:39,841 --> 01:13:44,770
adolescent sort of angst before we get 
out of the fucking house and go out onto

1638
01:13:44,771 --> 01:13:45,900
the our own.
I mean,

1639
01:13:45,901 --> 01:13:50,901
we're,
we're becoming adults as a civilization 

1640
01:13:50,901 --> 01:13:54,020
and along the way we're experiencing the
fucking teenage hormonal rage that you 

1641
01:13:55,291 --> 01:14:00,291
know,
a 14 year old has when they're still 

1642
01:14:00,291 --> 01:14:02,061
trapped in their parents house with the 
freedom that human beings are going to 

1643
01:14:02,061 --> 01:14:05,871
have in the future to communicate and 
express themselves is going to negate a 

1644
01:14:05,871 --> 01:14:09,090
lot of this Hashtag college racism or 
Hashtag college activism.

1645
01:14:09,330 --> 01:14:14,330
I think what that's coming from is this,
this feeling that a lot of people have 

1646
01:14:14,330 --> 01:14:14,330
that their,
their,

1647
01:14:14,330 --> 01:14:16,540
their ideas and their opinions aren't 
taken into consideration.

1648
01:14:16,720 --> 01:14:20,770
That they're not taken seriously and 
that that's why they're overreacting and

1649
01:14:20,890 --> 01:14:23,000
freaking out and walking through the 
fucking,

1650
01:14:23,030 --> 01:14:25,000
the hallways and Dartmouth and the 
library.

1651
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:27,490
Black lives matter,
black lives matter.

1652
01:14:27,610 --> 01:14:28,740
Like what?
What are they doing?

1653
01:14:28,780 --> 01:14:33,780
What do you have a greater ability to 
nail joe to communicate with each other 

1654
01:14:33,780 --> 01:14:34,010
than we ever have already.
So recent.

1655
01:14:34,130 --> 01:14:35,030
It's so recent.
I mean,

1656
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:38,090
I take your point with certainly in the 
adolescents of our,

1657
01:14:38,180 --> 01:14:43,180
of our species and,
but I do suspect that you're looking at 

1658
01:14:43,180 --> 01:14:47,981
this through the prism of a mind that 
spends a lot of time thinking about 

1659
01:14:47,981 --> 01:14:49,370
things and a lot of time having 
experiences that,

1660
01:14:49,371 --> 01:14:54,371
uh,
that are uplifting and transcendence 

1661
01:14:54,371 --> 01:14:54,371
stay through.
I'm trying to,

1662
01:14:54,371 --> 01:14:55,390
trying to find a way of saying drugs,
just drugs,

1663
01:14:56,050 --> 01:14:57,410
but not just drugs,
a float,

1664
01:14:57,411 --> 01:14:58,160
tanks,
meditation,

1665
01:14:58,240 --> 01:15:03,240
whatever else it is that you've,
that you do in order to gain a 

1666
01:15:03,240 --> 01:15:05,480
perspective on things that is beyond 
your own little tribe.

1667
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:10,840
My concern is whether or not there is a 
direct correlation between upgrading 

1668
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:10,850
our,
uh,

1669
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:14,330
the means of communication with you.
That obviously the way that we currently

1670
01:15:14,331 --> 01:15:18,230
communicate is going to seem completely 
antiquated in decades to come.

1671
01:15:19,340 --> 01:15:21,860
But what we've seen happen when,
like when the Internet began,

1672
01:15:21,861 --> 01:15:25,280
you sound to me a little bit like people
who I would listen to in the 19 nineties

1673
01:15:25,281 --> 01:15:27,980
who would say when once everyone is on 
the line,

1674
01:15:28,020 --> 01:15:33,020
there's going to be no need for 
difference anymore because everyone's 

1675
01:15:33,020 --> 01:15:33,020
going to be able to communicate 
everything.

1676
01:15:33,020 --> 01:15:37,511
And everyone's going to be able to be 
exposed to so many different ideas that 

1677
01:15:37,511 --> 01:15:38,030
you're not going to be able to be nclr 
anymore.

1678
01:15:38,031 --> 01:15:39,980
You're not going to be able to be 
parochial anymore,

1679
01:15:39,981 --> 01:15:42,320
trapped in your own little circle of 
beliefs.

1680
01:15:42,321 --> 01:15:47,321
Because with the Internet,
everything's going to be available at 

1681
01:15:47,321 --> 01:15:47,321
everyone's fingertips.
So some people,

1682
01:15:47,321 --> 01:15:52,180
yeah,
there a futurist who was saying that of 

1683
01:15:52,180 --> 01:15:52,650
course what's happened is we've had the 
opposite effect that that the,

1684
01:15:52,670 --> 01:15:57,670
the availability of communication has on
a widespread scale has actually enabled 

1685
01:15:57,670 --> 01:16:02,591
people to silo themselves into little 
self thinking like communities of 

1686
01:16:03,141 --> 01:16:07,160
Sameness so that we're actually more 
divided than we've ever been because you

1687
01:16:07,161 --> 01:16:12,161
can seek out only the information that 
comports with the way that you see the 

1688
01:16:12,161 --> 01:16:15,701
world.
So I don't think that a technology is 

1689
01:16:15,701 --> 01:16:17,951
necessarily going to drive an awakening.
I think the awakening comes from drugs 

1690
01:16:17,991 --> 01:16:22,991
and spiritual epiphany's and then the 
communication can be a tool to enact 

1691
01:16:22,991 --> 01:16:27,191
that,
but I can just as easily see some 

1692
01:16:27,191 --> 01:16:28,760
communication revolution being 
manipulated by jihadis,

1693
01:16:28,761 --> 01:16:33,761
the way that they currently use the 
internet and twitter to coordinate 

1694
01:16:33,761 --> 01:16:33,761
terrorist attacks.

1695
01:16:33,761 --> 01:16:33,920
I don't think it's an either or.
I didn't.

1696
01:16:33,930 --> 01:16:36,500
I,
I definitely think that there are groups

1697
01:16:36,501 --> 01:16:40,380
of insulated people that searched for 
confirmation bias and they,

1698
01:16:40,490 --> 01:16:45,490
they stay within their tribe,
but I think one of the reasons why 

1699
01:16:45,490 --> 01:16:49,211
they're so active now and there's more 
of them is because they're recognizing 

1700
01:16:49,211 --> 01:16:52,370
the inevitable future and that you 
really,

1701
01:16:52,371 --> 01:16:55,160
you're not going to be able to insulate 
yourself in the past like you better get

1702
01:16:55,161 --> 01:17:00,161
it in now while you can better stockpile
that fucking food because the famine's 

1703
01:17:00,161 --> 01:17:03,491
coming.
I think what you're going to experience 

1704
01:17:03,491 --> 01:17:06,071
in the future is going to be more and 
more deterioration of these insulated 

1705
01:17:06,831 --> 01:17:08,840
little tribes and I think that that's 
where we're.

1706
01:17:09,290 --> 01:17:10,700
When people have to apologize for 
things,

1707
01:17:10,701 --> 01:17:15,701
they would never have to apologize 
before people like w what we were 

1708
01:17:15,701 --> 01:17:16,040
talking about,
like the Al Franken saying,

1709
01:17:16,041 --> 01:17:17,330
rush limbaugh is a big fat idiot.

1710
01:17:17,330 --> 01:17:19,880
That was just a few years ago that he 
wrote that book.

1711
01:17:19,910 --> 01:17:21,160
Maybe a decade ago.
You,

1712
01:17:21,300 --> 01:17:26,300
you can't write that book today.
You couldn't put that book on the 

1713
01:17:26,300 --> 01:17:26,300
shelves.
You wouldn't,

1714
01:17:26,300 --> 01:17:30,470
wouldn't be supported.
It wouldn't be supported by Barnes and 

1715
01:17:30,470 --> 01:17:32,801
noble,
like you calling something a big fat 

1716
01:17:32,801 --> 01:17:32,801
idiot is fat shaming now and I think 
that this,

1717
01:17:32,910 --> 01:17:36,830
this increased outrage is also increased
sensitivity.

1718
01:17:36,950 --> 01:17:40,640
It's also increased understanding and 
once the dust settles in the argument,

1719
01:17:40,820 --> 01:17:45,820
then people have to like do you have to 
take into consideration the validity of 

1720
01:17:45,820 --> 01:17:49,751
other people's opinions?
Whether or not you agree with them or 

1721
01:17:49,751 --> 01:17:52,061
not,
you have to understand that it's just a 

1722
01:17:52,061 --> 01:17:54,731
matter of this,
this broad range of people expressing 

1723
01:17:54,731 --> 01:17:58,481
themselves will slowly.
It'll slowly come down to an 

1724
01:17:58,481 --> 01:17:58,481
understandable vibration.

1725
01:17:58,550 --> 01:18:03,550
I hope so.
So let's just unpack two things that 

1726
01:18:03,550 --> 01:18:03,550
we're talking about.
Someone not conflating two things,

1727
01:18:03,550 --> 01:18:05,150
right?
One is the social justice warrior debate

1728
01:18:05,151 --> 01:18:07,070
here in the United States and the other 
is Islamism,

1729
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:10,160
and we're sort of kind of having two 
parallel conversations about that.

1730
01:18:10,161 --> 01:18:15,161
At the same time in terms of social 
social justice warriors in the United 

1731
01:18:15,161 --> 01:18:16,580
States,
I think I hope that you're right,

1732
01:18:16,581 --> 01:18:21,581
that what they think that they're doing 
is being an extension of the great 

1733
01:18:21,581 --> 01:18:23,060
traditions of civil rights in America.
In other words,

1734
01:18:23,061 --> 01:18:26,300
that they being motivated by a sense of 
understanding.

1735
01:18:26,301 --> 01:18:31,301
I just found a passion and an outrage 
against what they perceive as being 

1736
01:18:31,301 --> 01:18:35,440
outrageous injustice.
My concern is that what they're also 

1737
01:18:35,440 --> 01:18:38,861
doing is buying into a long tradition of
intolerance and a lack of respect for 

1738
01:18:40,401 --> 01:18:45,401
pluralism and for other people's ideas 
about things for other people's right to

1739
01:18:45,411 --> 01:18:49,040
express ideas that they regard as being 
incorrect.

1740
01:18:49,340 --> 01:18:54,340
There's A.
I mentioned earlier this study that I 

1741
01:18:54,340 --> 01:18:54,340
thought you liked that I bought.
Let me just find it because it's good.

1742
01:18:54,340 --> 01:18:54,710
It's so.
There's this,

1743
01:18:54,711 --> 01:18:59,711
uh,
there's this professor called April 

1744
01:18:59,711 --> 01:19:02,240
Kelly and she's a professor of political
science at Elizabeth town college and 

1745
01:19:02,240 --> 01:19:04,160
she's got a chapter in this new paper 
called the end of the experiment,

1746
01:19:04,161 --> 01:19:07,400
the rise of cultural elites and the 
decline of American civic culture.

1747
01:19:07,730 --> 01:19:12,730
And it's,
it's this study which is called the 

1748
01:19:12,730 --> 01:19:16,210
General Social Survey,
which looks at how tolerant or 

1749
01:19:16,210 --> 01:19:17,120
intolerant particular demographics of 
Americans are.

1750
01:19:17,330 --> 01:19:19,460
Right.
So they stopped by on.

1751
01:19:19,470 --> 01:19:21,740
I'll get tangled up in my microphone 
here.

1752
01:19:21,741 --> 01:19:23,510
I was getting too relaxed listening to 
you talk.

1753
01:19:24,890 --> 01:19:26,380
I was like kicking back.
I was like,

1754
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:28,340
getting out the popcorn,
listened to Joe.

1755
01:19:28,760 --> 01:19:30,590
Uh,
so in the general social survey,

1756
01:19:30,591 --> 01:19:31,430
they,
they,

1757
01:19:31,431 --> 01:19:33,590
uh,
they propose a bunch of different groups

1758
01:19:33,890 --> 01:19:38,890
and they asked people how much they 
would like or dislike that group of 

1759
01:19:38,890 --> 01:19:38,890
people,
right?

1760
01:19:38,890 --> 01:19:38,900
Just to establish who we really,
really don't like.

1761
01:19:39,320 --> 01:19:44,320
The least liked group included in the 
survey was Muslim clergymen who preach 

1762
01:19:45,861 --> 01:19:48,230
hatred against the United States.
Right?

1763
01:19:48,231 --> 01:19:53,231
That's understandable.
And the second least liked group among 

1764
01:19:53,231 --> 01:19:57,851
Americans,
people who believed that blacks are 

1765
01:19:57,851 --> 01:19:58,010
genetically inferior,
so racist.

1766
01:19:58,550 --> 01:20:03,020
So then they ask people how tolerant 
they would be to,

1767
01:20:03,650 --> 01:20:08,650
towards those,
a person from that class of people 

1768
01:20:08,650 --> 01:20:11,770
giving speech,
a public speech in their community and 

1769
01:20:12,150 --> 01:20:17,150
people in their forties,
a more tolerant than people in their 

1770
01:20:17,150 --> 01:20:20,031
thirties and people in their thirties 
and more tolerant than people in their 

1771
01:20:20,031 --> 01:20:22,911
twenties when people in their forties,
the proportion who say that a member 

1772
01:20:22,911 --> 01:20:27,591
that a Muslim clergymen who preaches 
hatred against the United States should 

1773
01:20:27,591 --> 01:20:30,090
not be allowed to give a public speech 
is 43 percent people in their thirties.

1774
01:20:30,180 --> 01:20:32,340
Fifty two percent people in their 
twenties,

1775
01:20:32,490 --> 01:20:37,490
60 percent.
So if tolerance means not like,

1776
01:20:37,620 --> 01:20:38,760
oh,
I support black rights,

1777
01:20:38,761 --> 01:20:41,040
or I support gay rights,
I support Trans Rights,

1778
01:20:41,220 --> 01:20:45,210
but if it means respecting the right of 
someone who you really disagree with,

1779
01:20:45,720 --> 01:20:50,720
to express that opinion,
then young people are actually more 

1780
01:20:50,720 --> 01:20:54,140
intolerant now than older people.
They're more tolerant towards 

1781
01:20:54,140 --> 01:20:56,090
homosexuals and atheists,
but that's because they like homosexuals

1782
01:20:56,100 --> 01:20:58,140
and atheists more than older people do.
Right?

1783
01:20:58,141 --> 01:21:00,210
That's not tolerance.
Tolerance is,

1784
01:21:00,300 --> 01:21:05,300
is not a measure of liking someone,
but a willingness to extend political 

1785
01:21:05,300 --> 01:21:06,360
freedoms to people who you disliked when
young people are less,

1786
01:21:06,361 --> 01:21:07,290
less willing to do that.

1787
01:21:07,340 --> 01:21:12,340
Well,
I think what you're saying though is 

1788
01:21:12,340 --> 01:21:12,340
they're less willing to accept hate 
speech,

1789
01:21:12,340 --> 01:21:17,171
which they think are dangerous or 
dangerous conversations.

1790
01:21:17,420 --> 01:21:19,430
They think that someone who is a Muslim 
clergymen,

1791
01:21:19,670 --> 01:21:22,460
who wants to express the hate of 
America,

1792
01:21:22,461 --> 01:21:25,160
it's dangerous because he could promote 
terrorist attacks.

1793
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:30,280
Someone who thinks that black people are
genetically inferior to white people is 

1794
01:21:30,280 --> 01:21:34,481
dangerous because they could promote 
racism or they could promote someone 

1795
01:21:34,481 --> 01:21:39,170
confirming their racist beliefs and then
instead of becoming educated,

1796
01:21:39,171 --> 01:21:44,171
are becoming enlightened.
They go with the initial racist 

1797
01:21:44,171 --> 01:21:44,750
instincts and they go,
I was right.

1798
01:21:44,930 --> 01:21:46,690
You know the white man is superior,
you know,

1799
01:21:46,691 --> 01:21:47,490
and they're,
they're,

1800
01:21:47,500 --> 01:21:49,450
they're worried about hate,
right?

1801
01:21:49,570 --> 01:21:50,320
We're just talking

1802
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:52,450
both.
Both those things are about hate.

1803
01:21:53,490 --> 01:21:55,500
This is Meryl Streep's Teesha at saying 
better,

1804
01:21:55,501 --> 01:21:56,690
a rebel in a slave about,
hey,

1805
01:21:56,691 --> 01:22:01,691
because it is to,
is to a lot of people in their 20 

1806
01:22:01,691 --> 01:22:01,691
people.
How many people?

1807
01:22:01,691 --> 01:22:03,150
Well enough people that she has to put 
out a press release about it.

1808
01:22:03,450 --> 01:22:05,370
I think like,
I don't think there's anything.

1809
01:22:05,430 --> 01:22:10,430
I think we are better off living in a 
society where bad ideas are exposed to 

1810
01:22:11,910 --> 01:22:13,320
conversation.
I mean,

1811
01:22:13,500 --> 01:22:15,780
you know,
sunlight is the best disinfectant.

1812
01:22:15,781 --> 01:22:20,781
You want bad ideas out there.
You want a big roiling conversation 

1813
01:22:20,781 --> 01:22:24,530
where people who are stupid or 
ridiculous ideas about the genetic 

1814
01:22:24,530 --> 01:22:24,530
inferiority of,
of,

1815
01:22:24,530 --> 01:22:27,840
of black people are able to be exposed,
be argued with,

1816
01:22:27,841 --> 01:22:30,150
be contented because racists aren't just
going to go away.

1817
01:22:30,151 --> 01:22:32,760
If you bend them talking,
they're going to go onto ground.

1818
01:22:32,761 --> 01:22:37,761
They're going to find out the 
communities they gonna they gonna 

1819
01:22:37,761 --> 01:22:38,700
increasingly self segregate into their 
own little communities online.

1820
01:22:39,030 --> 01:22:41,670
You want,
I think you want free speech to be a big

1821
01:22:41,671 --> 01:22:46,671
roiling debate.
You don't want to be censorious and 

1822
01:22:46,671 --> 01:22:49,850
judgmental and intolerant towards people
whose eyes you just you whose ideas you 

1823
01:22:49,850 --> 01:22:54,081
disagree with.
You want to take them on and expose why 

1824
01:22:54,081 --> 01:22:54,081
those ideas are wrong,
and hopefully through that,

1825
01:22:54,081 --> 01:22:56,220
through that wrestling match,
that intellectual wrestling match,

1826
01:22:56,460 --> 01:23:00,570
you will end up progressing forward your
progress forward by simply banning ideas

1827
01:23:00,571 --> 01:23:03,910
that you think are are objectionable.
That's agreed.

1828
01:23:03,930 --> 01:23:06,250
You know that's a very important point.
I think

1829
01:23:06,250 --> 01:23:11,250
what they're worried about though is 
these people going to schools and 

1830
01:23:11,250 --> 01:23:14,371
indoctrinating very gullible or very 
impressionable young people and that's 

1831
01:23:14,371 --> 01:23:19,111
a.
that's a legit thing because they 

1832
01:23:19,111 --> 01:23:19,111
didn't.

1833
01:23:19,111 --> 01:23:19,111
That reinforces the Gullibility,
right?

1834
01:23:19,111 --> 01:23:24,041
Because you don't get it,
you haven't been exposed to any other 

1835
01:23:24,041 --> 01:23:24,041
right,

1836
01:23:24,041 --> 01:23:26,360
is that they themselves have been 
indoctrinated into the idea of 

1837
01:23:26,360 --> 01:23:29,721
liberalism and liberal thinking by a 
charismatic people with interesting 

1838
01:23:29,721 --> 01:23:34,371
ideas that they believe in 
wholeheartedly and they're very 

1839
01:23:34,371 --> 01:23:34,860
confident in what they're saying,
that they speak very well.

1840
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:37,570
Those ideas become infectious and 
sometimes those.

1841
01:23:37,890 --> 01:23:42,090
I've expressed this before on the 
podcast that I listened to these Islamic

1842
01:23:42,091 --> 01:23:47,091
clergyman speak,
and although I have zero desire to 

1843
01:23:47,091 --> 01:23:51,291
become a Muslim,
there's something intoxicating about 

1844
01:23:51,291 --> 01:23:54,831
people that extremely confident about 
their ideology and that's dangerous for 

1845
01:23:54,831 --> 01:23:54,831
people.
It's dangerous.

1846
01:23:54,831 --> 01:23:57,150
You have a person like me who's done a 
lot of fucking drugs,

1847
01:23:57,300 --> 01:24:00,300
who does a lot of meditation,
is involved in martial arts.

1848
01:24:00,301 --> 01:24:03,840
I'm a free thinker.
I'm a non theistic sort of a thinker,

1849
01:24:03,990 --> 01:24:08,990
but I watch these people have these 
conversations with these massive crowds 

1850
01:24:09,330 --> 01:24:12,630
and they're saying all these crazy 
things about Islam being the truth and I

1851
01:24:12,631 --> 01:24:17,370
feel I have a fee.
I feel an understanding why people would

1852
01:24:17,371 --> 01:24:22,371
be drawn to that.
I'm not saying that I'm drawn to it 

1853
01:24:22,371 --> 01:24:25,161
myself,
but I understand it like I feel that 

1854
01:24:25,161 --> 01:24:28,220
the.
The compelling idea behind someone 

1855
01:24:28,220 --> 01:24:28,290
joining a group like that.

1856
01:24:28,690 --> 01:24:33,690
I think that's right.
I think it's because certainty is 

1857
01:24:33,690 --> 01:24:33,690
intoxicating.
Yes.

1858
01:24:33,690 --> 01:24:33,790
Yes.
Like if you're.

1859
01:24:33,820 --> 01:24:36,310
If you're discombobulated,
if the world is complicated,

1860
01:24:36,311 --> 01:24:41,311
if you'd done what to make of Shit,
especially if you're in a situation 

1861
01:24:41,311 --> 01:24:43,090
where you feel like you've been on for a
lot of time,

1862
01:24:43,091 --> 01:24:47,600
which is what a lot of these followers 
of these extremists do feel like a.

1863
01:24:47,650 --> 01:24:52,650
Then it's nice to just have clarity 
that's just have someone who knows what 

1864
01:24:52,650 --> 01:24:55,030
the truth is and who knows what the 
right path is.

1865
01:24:55,410 --> 01:24:59,790
A perfect example that is country music.
I guarantee you

1866
01:24:59,960 --> 01:25:03,590
if you'd asked to list five things that 
you are going to end that sentence with,

1867
01:25:03,620 --> 01:25:05,300
it wouldn't have country music would not
have been top,

1868
01:25:05,301 --> 01:25:05,830
top 50.

1869
01:25:06,020 --> 01:25:09,650
I know a lot of people that I love 
dearly that liked country music and they

1870
01:25:09,651 --> 01:25:14,651
lead.
They read the least out of all the 

1871
01:25:14,651 --> 01:25:14,651
people that I know.
All the people that I know that are like

1872
01:25:14,651 --> 01:25:16,520
really into like really dumb country 
music.

1873
01:25:16,670 --> 01:25:19,310
These motherfuckers on aware of shit 
that's going on in the world.

1874
01:25:19,580 --> 01:25:22,670
I have good friends that I love,
but you know,

1875
01:25:22,671 --> 01:25:27,671
I have to talk to them.
Especially for like from the hunting 

1876
01:25:27,671 --> 01:25:30,041
world,
like the hunting world has goddamn 

1877
01:25:30,041 --> 01:25:32,470
hilarious because I've somehow or 
another become a part of this world 

1878
01:25:32,470 --> 01:25:36,191
because I've expressed this idea that I 
think is very important that we should 

1879
01:25:36,191 --> 01:25:37,020
be aware of where our food comes from 
and then uh,

1880
01:25:37,060 --> 01:25:41,480
and I've become someone who gathers 
their food from a hunting way,

1881
01:25:41,630 --> 01:25:45,320
but then you connect yourself with these
people that are also in this,

1882
01:25:45,321 --> 01:25:48,050
which became very religious.
There's a lot of really,

1883
01:25:48,080 --> 01:25:50,540
but,
but it's weird kind of religion.

1884
01:25:50,790 --> 01:25:51,370
It's,
it's,

1885
01:25:51,540 --> 01:25:56,540
it's almost like a hashtag activist sort
of religious idea where they don't 

1886
01:25:57,051 --> 01:26:00,200
understand the texts they don't like.
They'll have religious tattoos.

1887
01:26:00,450 --> 01:26:01,180
Like,
Hey fucker,

1888
01:26:01,190 --> 01:26:03,560
you got to read the whole book.
Like the book says,

1889
01:26:03,561 --> 01:26:06,740
don't Tattoo yourself just like it says,
don't blow guys.

1890
01:26:07,460 --> 01:26:09,540
Like you can't be.
Like,

1891
01:26:09,660 --> 01:26:11,110
I've had arguments with people but

1892
01:26:12,100 --> 01:26:15,290
pretty much more explicit about the 
don't get a tattoo then don't blow a guy

1893
01:26:15,470 --> 01:26:18,370
blow a guy.
Beat is always nebulous about like lying

1894
01:26:18,371 --> 01:26:19,300
with another male Wilson

1895
01:26:20,020 --> 01:26:24,040
the no tattoo on his knees and sucks my 
desk.

1896
01:26:25,090 --> 01:26:28,880
There's no lying.
The the tattoo thing is very clear,

1897
01:26:28,881 --> 01:26:33,881
but when I got into it with these people
was when that woman from Kentucky 

1898
01:26:33,881 --> 01:26:38,351
wouldn't marry gay people and I wrote 
this piece on instagram and facebook and

1899
01:26:39,441 --> 01:26:44,441
it got millions of likes and all these 
people traded it back and forth and I 

1900
01:26:44,441 --> 01:26:48,311
got all this blow back from the hunting 
community because all these people that 

1901
01:26:48,311 --> 01:26:51,491
are really into God or really into 
religion and then you know,

1902
01:26:51,941 --> 01:26:53,360
they're,
they're also recognizing them.

1903
01:26:53,410 --> 01:26:58,410
So like they were getting pressured by 
friends who are in the hunting 

1904
01:26:58,410 --> 01:27:01,271
community.
We're getting pressure to talk to me 

1905
01:27:01,271 --> 01:27:01,271
about my stance on God.
Like,

1906
01:27:01,271 --> 01:27:01,800
this is hilarious.
Like,

1907
01:27:01,980 --> 01:27:03,980
well,
how much do you guys actually know about

1908
01:27:03,981 --> 01:27:05,960
the scripts?
How much have you guys read?

1909
01:27:06,140 --> 01:27:11,140
What?
How much do you know about the origins 

1910
01:27:11,140 --> 01:27:11,140
of the scripts?
And it turns out very little.

1911
01:27:11,140 --> 01:27:11,300
Most of them,
very little,

1912
01:27:11,540 --> 01:27:15,590
but there's this need to simplify things
that appear to be very complex.

1913
01:27:15,800 --> 01:27:18,650
And the way to simplify things is put it
all in God's hands.

1914
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:21,010
It's all about Jesus.
You know Jesus.

1915
01:27:21,011 --> 01:27:26,011
Hell,
I'll tell you why I'm going to vote for 

1916
01:27:26,011 --> 01:27:26,011
him because he's on Jesus.

1917
01:27:26,011 --> 01:27:29,980
This comes back to the problem of 
tribalism that we were alluding to 

1918
01:27:29,980 --> 01:27:29,980
earlier in the show,
right?

1919
01:27:29,980 --> 01:27:33,620
That there is no greater way of 
encouraging people to be tribalistic 

1920
01:27:33,620 --> 01:27:36,140
than religion or political affiliation.
Loosely,

1921
01:27:36,200 --> 01:27:37,180
loosely understood.
Right?

1922
01:27:37,490 --> 01:27:38,900
So there's a,
you know,

1923
01:27:38,901 --> 01:27:41,310
Dan Collins History podcast.
Man.

1924
01:27:41,320 --> 01:27:43,490
I love the best.
Just incredible.

1925
01:27:43,491 --> 01:27:44,580
Have you had him on the show?
Oh yeah.

1926
01:27:44,630 --> 01:27:45,680
A bunch of stuff.
Fantastic.

1927
01:27:45,681 --> 01:27:46,670
I have,
I missed those episodes.

1928
01:27:47,910 --> 01:27:49,190
I've just,
I've just been listening.

1929
01:27:49,191 --> 01:27:52,370
I've almost finished getting through his
world war one thing,

1930
01:27:52,371 --> 01:27:55,130
which is like five episodes of three and
a half hours.

1931
01:27:55,180 --> 01:28:00,180
Eat Right.
This is like Rogan esque duration 

1932
01:28:00,180 --> 01:28:00,180
podcast,

1933
01:28:00,180 --> 01:28:03,570
but way more,
way more like produced way more.

1934
01:28:03,641 --> 01:28:06,340
I mean it's brilliant.
It's like there audio books.

1935
01:28:06,610 --> 01:28:11,610
Yes.
I mean it's like a 20 hour explanation 

1936
01:28:11,610 --> 01:28:12,260
of the first world war.
It's so good.

1937
01:28:12,320 --> 01:28:15,110
And so one of the things that he's 
talking about is when he's talking about

1938
01:28:15,111 --> 01:28:20,111
the Bulcans,
he's saying like when the bulcans 

1939
01:28:20,111 --> 01:28:23,530
imploded in the 19 nineties and we had 
the collapse of Yugoslavia and united 

1940
01:28:23,530 --> 01:28:25,130
Bosnia and Serbia and all that,
he's like,

1941
01:28:25,131 --> 01:28:29,630
you go there even to this day and you 
talk to a Bosnian Muslim,

1942
01:28:29,720 --> 01:28:34,720
will you talk to a Serb or you talk to a
cro at about the problems that they've 

1943
01:28:35,511 --> 01:28:40,511
endured.
And every single one of them will point 

1944
01:28:40,511 --> 01:28:43,751
a finger at the other groups and say 
they've been doing this to us for so 

1945
01:28:43,751 --> 01:28:47,411
long and that back in this day.
And they did that and then they did 

1946
01:28:47,411 --> 01:28:47,411
that.
And then they did that.

1947
01:28:47,411 --> 01:28:47,480
It's like the Israelis and the 
Palestinians or something.

1948
01:28:47,481 --> 01:28:48,080
Because like,
oh well,

1949
01:28:48,110 --> 01:28:49,220
you know,
10,000

1950
01:28:49,240 --> 01:28:51,140
fucking years ago,
my ancestors got massive,

1951
01:28:51,141 --> 01:28:52,010
goodbye blahdy Blah.

1952
01:28:52,460 --> 01:28:56,750
And it's so easy to think of ourselves 
in terms of aggrieved groups,

1953
01:28:56,990 --> 01:29:00,440
whether or not.
And my problem with religion is,

1954
01:29:00,441 --> 01:29:05,441
and my problem with this is this is sort
of a weird parallel that I'm drawing 

1955
01:29:05,441 --> 01:29:06,210
just as I'm sort of thinking this up 
right now.

1956
01:29:06,211 --> 01:29:11,211
But there is a parallel between jihadis 
and social justice warriors in the sense

1957
01:29:11,551 --> 01:29:16,551
that they ate.
You're able to take an off the shelf 

1958
01:29:16,551 --> 01:29:19,590
prepackaged kind of identity instead of 
beliefs about things and gain certainty 

1959
01:29:19,590 --> 01:29:24,471
from it and be part of a tribe and be 
part of a community and be fighting the 

1960
01:29:24,471 --> 01:29:25,530
good fight against people who disagree 
with them.

1961
01:29:25,550 --> 01:29:28,170
They'll hold beliefs that they believe 
are objectionable.

1962
01:29:28,230 --> 01:29:31,710
Whether that belief is that the west is 
at war with Islam,

1963
01:29:31,711 --> 01:29:33,270
which is what your do you think that we 
want,

1964
01:29:34,230 --> 01:29:36,060
or whether the belief is that,
uh,

1965
01:29:36,061 --> 01:29:41,061
that racist racism is okay,
which is what social justice warriors 

1966
01:29:41,061 --> 01:29:44,301
think that all white people think right?
There are these easy off the shelf 

1967
01:29:44,641 --> 01:29:46,620
categories.
So think independently.

1968
01:29:46,621 --> 01:29:47,040
People

1969
01:29:47,360 --> 01:29:49,880
thinking independently is a good idea.
Um,

1970
01:29:50,160 --> 01:29:51,780
I don't know if I'm with you on that one
though.

1971
01:29:52,670 --> 01:29:55,670
Just the stories of the Jihad.
I see where you go in with it.

1972
01:29:56,440 --> 01:29:57,140
I think

1973
01:29:57,470 --> 01:30:02,470
world,
their worldviews that are self 

1974
01:30:02,470 --> 01:30:02,630
reinforcing and their cliques that are 
soft supporting.

1975
01:30:02,870 --> 01:30:07,870
Right?
So you don't have to ask a lot of 

1976
01:30:07,870 --> 01:30:07,870
difficult questions.

1977
01:30:07,870 --> 01:30:10,540
Right.
I totally understand what you're saying 

1978
01:30:10,540 --> 01:30:12,420
in that sense.
I think extreme liberalism is a a sense 

1979
01:30:12,420 --> 01:30:15,820
may like extreme conservatism is a 
religion in a sense.

1980
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:16,660
Yeah.
Yeah,

1981
01:30:16,720 --> 01:30:17,920
I think so.
It's an ideology.

1982
01:30:18,010 --> 01:30:23,010
Ideologies are very dangerous ideologies
where you have locked into a 

1983
01:30:23,010 --> 01:30:25,600
predetermined pattern of thinking that 
you just have to conform to,

1984
01:30:25,810 --> 01:30:28,960
I think becomes very problematic for 
people because the world is fluid.

1985
01:30:28,961 --> 01:30:30,670
It's.
There's a lot going on,

1986
01:30:30,680 --> 01:30:35,680
lot of weirdness to it,
and I think that there's also an issue 

1987
01:30:35,680 --> 01:30:38,671
in communication through language and 
communication through words and the 

1988
01:30:38,671 --> 01:30:39,700
ability to express yourself through 
words.

1989
01:30:39,701 --> 01:30:41,800
It's sometimes difficult because you're 
trying to do,

1990
01:30:42,040 --> 01:30:47,040
as you're trying to express intent,
you're trying to get someone to 

1991
01:30:47,040 --> 01:30:47,830
understand how you think and view things
and you're trying to say,

1992
01:30:47,831 --> 01:30:52,831
well,
why don't you express and view yourself 

1993
01:30:52,831 --> 01:30:52,831
like I do,
or why don't you see things?

1994
01:30:52,831 --> 01:30:57,541
How I do,
and maybe you're talking to someone who 

1995
01:30:57,541 --> 01:30:59,971
has a completely different idea of what 
those words mean and completely 

1996
01:30:59,971 --> 01:31:04,410
different idea of the context of this 
particular scenario that you're 

1997
01:31:04,410 --> 01:31:04,900
discussing.
It's hard.

1998
01:31:04,901 --> 01:31:05,680
It's,
it's clumsy.

1999
01:31:05,681 --> 01:31:06,970
Isn't that very difficult

2000
01:31:06,970 --> 01:31:11,970
because you've got this kind of platonic
ideal in your head of what you want to 

2001
01:31:11,970 --> 01:31:15,301
communicate and then you have to just 
rummage around in the scrabble bucket 

2002
01:31:15,301 --> 01:31:16,240
for for the closest approximation to 
what it is

2003
01:31:16,270 --> 01:31:21,270
you're trying to impart.
That's why podcasts are so unique in a 

2004
01:31:21,270 --> 01:31:24,040
way because you know one of the 
beautiful things about it is that you do

2005
01:31:24,041 --> 01:31:28,120
sort of search for the correct way to.
I mean you hear us do this sometimes,

2006
01:31:28,121 --> 01:31:32,410
but this is like this is what we're 
doing is we're just trying to figure out

2007
01:31:32,411 --> 01:31:37,411
what's the best way for me to express 
this idea that I've got bouncing around 

2008
01:31:37,411 --> 01:31:38,670
in my head where I'm trying to 
understand how,

2009
01:31:38,800 --> 01:31:41,590
how this thing sort of lays out to 
everybody else.

2010
01:31:41,591 --> 01:31:42,850
Like how do I,
how do I,

2011
01:31:42,910 --> 01:31:47,910
how do I broadcast it?
How do I get it out there in a way 

2012
01:31:47,910 --> 01:31:50,731
where,
you know what I'm actually saying what 

2013
01:31:50,731 --> 01:31:50,731
I'm actually thinking instead of getting
outraged,

2014
01:31:50,731 --> 01:31:52,810
it's something that's not what I meant.
Like this meryl streep thing.

2015
01:31:52,811 --> 01:31:54,070
Yes.
It's not what she meant.

2016
01:31:54,071 --> 01:31:56,830
She obviously didn't mean I don't want 
to be a slave,

2017
01:31:57,050 --> 01:31:58,980
I want to be a black person in the 1800

2018
01:31:59,210 --> 01:32:03,080
clay and there are certain triggers that
are really hard for people to get beyond

2019
01:32:03,110 --> 01:32:08,110
in communication,
but we have to find a way to get beyond 

2020
01:32:08,110 --> 01:32:11,220
like the,
I think the most pressing form of 

2021
01:32:11,220 --> 01:32:14,711
communication that we have to grapple 
with now is how do we speak to the 

2022
01:32:14,711 --> 01:32:19,331
Muslim community and to one another 
about the Muslim community and about 

2023
01:32:19,331 --> 01:32:23,051
jihadism without either being bigoted 
towards Muslims or pretending that there

2024
01:32:25,221 --> 01:32:30,221
isn't a problem of Islam,
Islam that has some relationship to the 

2025
01:32:30,221 --> 01:32:31,340
Muslim community and that has some 
relationship to the text of Islam.

2026
01:32:31,341 --> 01:32:36,341
Right?
Because the moment I say anything 

2027
01:32:36,341 --> 01:32:40,091
remotely suggesting like the day after 
the Charlie Hebdo attacks in Paris,

2028
01:32:41,150 --> 01:32:46,150
how uh,
Dayne went on morning joe on Msnbc and 

2029
01:32:46,150 --> 01:32:48,500
said,
these guys are about as Muslim as I am.

2030
01:32:50,510 --> 01:32:51,260
Well,
that's bullshit,

2031
01:32:51,500 --> 01:32:53,240
right?
I mean that's obviously not true.

2032
01:32:53,400 --> 01:32:56,720
Are more Muslim there arguably a lot 
more Muslim than most Muslims.

2033
01:32:56,721 --> 01:32:59,510
I mean they are very phonetically 
Muslim.

2034
01:32:59,540 --> 01:33:01,220
At least they think they are.
Right?

2035
01:33:01,550 --> 01:33:06,550
So we can't keep litigating whether or 
not they're theologically correct or 

2036
01:33:06,550 --> 01:33:10,391
whatever,
like there is obviously a cancer at the 

2037
01:33:10,391 --> 01:33:12,170
extremist fringe of Islam that has to be
dealt with and has to be talked about.

2038
01:33:12,171 --> 01:33:17,171
And the more we just talk about it,
the more the left talks about it in 

2039
01:33:17,171 --> 01:33:18,770
terms of well it's just a problem of 
extremism in all faiths.

2040
01:33:18,771 --> 01:33:23,771
It's got nothing to do with the faith,
the less able we are to actually have a 

2041
01:33:23,771 --> 01:33:26,570
conversation about what needs to be done
and how to win over moderate Muslims and

2042
01:33:26,571 --> 01:33:28,640
how not to alienate them.
Because if we,

2043
01:33:28,760 --> 01:33:33,760
if tolerant people can't talk about it,
then the only people talking about the 

2044
01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:37,250
problem a right wing xenophobes or 
fascists.

2045
01:33:37,250 --> 01:33:42,250
Right.
And so what we have to do is find a way 

2046
01:33:42,250 --> 01:33:43,610
when we talk about like those off the 
shelf ideologies,

2047
01:33:43,640 --> 01:33:46,570
whether it's jihadism or Social Justice 
Warrior Ism,

2048
01:33:47,390 --> 01:33:52,390
we have to find a way to win over 
moderate Muslims and make them not feel 

2049
01:33:52,390 --> 01:33:54,230
like they're being alienated and judged.
We have to not be,

2050
01:33:54,280 --> 01:33:59,280
you know,
sending southwest flights back to the 

2051
01:33:59,280 --> 01:34:01,211
gate as it were the other day.
Because two people were speaking Arabic 

2052
01:34:01,211 --> 01:34:03,380
and watching a video about what's going 
on in like the wake of the Paris attacks

2053
01:34:03,381 --> 01:34:06,410
or something and people freaked out 
because they don't know who I think will

2054
01:34:06,440 --> 01:34:11,440
Arab is a terrorist or something.
You have to make sure that doesn't 

2055
01:34:11,440 --> 01:34:13,961
happen,
but we can't have that not happen as 

2056
01:34:13,961 --> 01:34:15,920
long as everyone is pretending that 
there's not a problem with Islam,

2057
01:34:17,330 --> 01:34:22,330
right at the edge of Islam and I don't 
know how to have that conversation 

2058
01:34:22,330 --> 01:34:23,360
without sounding like I'm intolerant.
Keep

2059
01:34:23,360 --> 01:34:24,760
talking.
Everybody's gotTa.

2060
01:34:24,780 --> 01:34:26,930
Keep talking.
The arguments against it come up.

2061
01:34:26,931 --> 01:34:30,290
You talk about the arguments against it 
and it just just takes time.

2062
01:34:30,500 --> 01:34:35,500
I really do believe that.
I believe it just takes a lot of 

2063
01:34:35,500 --> 01:34:37,811
discourse,
takes a lot of communication and the 

2064
01:34:37,811 --> 01:34:38,470
clumsy type of communication that you 
get through language through,

2065
01:34:38,690 --> 01:34:41,540
through talking.
I think the more this happens,

2066
01:34:41,541 --> 01:34:46,541
the more this gets discussed,
the more people gained an understanding 

2067
01:34:46,541 --> 01:34:49,480
and again,
like we were looking at people aging or 

2068
01:34:49,480 --> 01:34:52,031
like trees growing.
It is a slow process that in the middle 

2069
01:34:52,031 --> 01:34:55,720
of it,
it doesn't seem like any progress is 

2070
01:34:55,720 --> 01:34:55,720
happening at all.
But ultimately,

2071
01:34:55,720 --> 01:34:57,050
if you look at the world today versus 
the world of 10 years ago,

2072
01:34:57,200 --> 01:35:02,200
you see a big difference between what Al
Franken was able to publish with that 

2073
01:35:02,200 --> 01:35:02,240
book and what you're able to get away 
with today.

2074
01:35:02,420 --> 01:35:06,590
And I think that sort of in a weird way,
for lack of a better analogy,

2075
01:35:06,740 --> 01:35:09,080
it highlights the growth that's going 
on.

2076
01:35:09,260 --> 01:35:13,580
It highlights this very strange era that
we're currently experiencing.

2077
01:35:13,880 --> 01:35:18,880
And with that,
let's end this and do your podcast so 

2078
01:35:18,880 --> 01:35:18,880
that we'll,
we'll get to.

2079
01:35:18,880 --> 01:35:20,240
We're going to keep talking folks,
but we have to end this because I got to

2080
01:35:20,241 --> 01:35:25,241
pick up my kid and a little bit,
but we're going to do an episode of we 

2081
01:35:25,241 --> 01:35:29,261
the people live Hashtag we,
the people lashed out with people like 

2082
01:35:29,261 --> 01:35:30,440
Josh Safran's podcast and it is 
available on itunes.

2083
01:35:30,441 --> 01:35:35,441
It's available cloud.

2084
01:35:35,441 --> 01:35:37,871
WTP underscore alive underscores what 
these fucking under WTP love to know 

2085
01:35:39,310 --> 01:35:40,950
what it is.
Why couldn't you just get weed?

2086
01:35:40,951 --> 01:35:43,610
The people the whole thing or is that 
too many letters?

2087
01:35:43,640 --> 01:35:45,670
I think it was too many lists.
Okay.

2088
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:47,630
All right.
We're going to do that and then we'll be

2089
01:35:47,631 --> 01:35:49,910
back.
But Johnny Depp's on twitter follow him.

podcast and uh,
