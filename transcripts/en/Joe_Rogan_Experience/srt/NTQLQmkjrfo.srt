00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:05,660
Hello Freak bitches left a fucking hole.
Just ate through his leg.

2
00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:06,560
Fair to Lance.
What?

3
00:00:06,561 --> 00:00:08,360
When it was snakes bite you,
that happens to you.

4
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:11,300
You have to sky got bit in the foot by
fair to Lance,

5
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:14,750
which means,
which by the way I believe means sort of

6
00:00:14,751 --> 00:00:17,970
fire fell.
Denounce his French fell announced

7
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:23,030
that don't show sounds fell donelle so
sat both fell.

8
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:26,630
By the way,
Brian Cowen did several characters over

9
00:00:26,631 --> 00:00:28,940
the time.
One of the reasons why I love going on

10
00:00:28,941 --> 00:00:32,880
these trips at Brian is because it
becomes a giant five day comedy comes

11
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:34,500
the bride couch.
I'll do this my,

12
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:36,200
it's a captive audience.
You're not going anywhere.

13
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:40,010
You're going to go.
But it's also your style of humor.

14
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:43,400
It's like that's what you do.
Like when there's a group of guys around

15
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,010
all of a sudden,
I mean you would think that you would

16
00:00:46,011 --> 00:00:47,900
get tired of gay jokes after five days.

17
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:49,760
No,
because he's got a bunch of different

18
00:00:49,761 --> 00:00:54,761
gay characters in the Russian who makes
you eat salad for many days for reflux.

19
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:57,120
You in the ass.
Cause he wants your asshole clean.

20
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,560
I have clean asshole.
You have to,

21
00:00:59,561 --> 00:01:01,940
we have to keep it clean,
clean.

22
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:06,980
Either just sell it.
I smack you this video of him explaining

23
00:01:07,011 --> 00:01:09,980
to Steve Rinella what he wants Reno's
diet to be like.

24
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,040
Dodi's thinking about putting it online
like somehow or another.

25
00:01:13,041 --> 00:01:16,820
Figuring out do it online,
do it an unnamed way.

26
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:20,180
It's mostly because I have you as an
audience and you're one of the best

27
00:01:20,181 --> 00:01:22,970
laughers.
I just realized that after known you for

28
00:01:22,971 --> 00:01:23,804
20 years.
I was like,

29
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:26,330
you know what?
I think he might be one of the greatest

30
00:01:26,331 --> 00:01:29,450
laughers cause you,
you cackle you literally,

31
00:01:29,451 --> 00:01:34,370
when you're laughing you literally go,
ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

32
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:35,750
How funny.
I,

33
00:01:35,751 --> 00:01:37,610
it's seductive to me.
I'm literally,

34
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:40,700
and then those guys or those guys are
such good audiences too.

35
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:45,810
Quintessential rock star with a
different spectrum than,

36
00:01:45,811 --> 00:01:47,340
you know,
maybe not.

37
00:01:47,341 --> 00:01:48,210
Not too,
I don't know.

38
00:01:48,211 --> 00:01:53,211
You're being drug induced delirium and
going through the,

39
00:01:53,731 --> 00:01:57,360
you know,
I think those dudes at that time had,

40
00:01:57,670 --> 00:02:00,960
had probably been through enough to say,
I've seen,

41
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:02,340
I've been to the limit.
You know,

42
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:05,730
I've seen the edge of the cliff debt.
But that's the old adage like if you

43
00:02:05,731 --> 00:02:07,180
suck enough,
uh,

44
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:09,450
Dick's,
one day you're going to want to have sex

45
00:02:09,451 --> 00:02:12,750
with a woman.
Like if a gay guy gets to some breaking

46
00:02:12,751 --> 00:02:16,380
point,
hundred million Dickson his ass and

47
00:02:16,381 --> 00:02:19,230
mouth,
he's like enough blizzard of Dick Knopf,

48
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:21,870
please take it wasn't a woman.
Well it doesn't happen,

49
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,150
but does it happen the other way where a
man,

50
00:02:24,151 --> 00:02:28,470
a straight man has so many different
female partners at one day he knew,

51
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:31,150
okay,
they fucked.

52
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,020
I want to be the guy that says,
I want to be the guy that says it a

53
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:39,690
little spoon.
If you're lying on someone's shoulder

54
00:02:39,691 --> 00:02:42,720
and they put their arm around like that,
what you do is you reach up at the left

55
00:02:42,721 --> 00:02:44,220
arm,
you protect the neck.

56
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:48,360
Very important
is that something like this?

57
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:51,810
You want to do it like this?
You want to cop it and don't let go of

58
00:02:51,811 --> 00:02:53,430
that wrist,
pin it down to your chest.

59
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:55,470
Dead.
You gotta you got shrimp out.

60
00:02:55,471 --> 00:02:59,260
I know you guys know about Hashtag
Hashtag trump out.

61
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,370
Oh man,
everybody,

62
00:03:00,371 --> 00:03:02,380
it's so great.
So great at the show.

63
00:03:02,381 --> 00:03:04,680
Sometimes people will just be like bad
shit.

64
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:06,490
It's like,
yeah.

65
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:08,590
So funny.

66
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:14,290
What a beautiful part of our history
here.

67
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:16,350
Joe Lou Reed.
Wasn't that Lou Reed?

68
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:23,950
David Bowie's God net worths Steve
Gutenberg.

69
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:27,520
David Bowie's Goddamn free lunch.
You know there was some study recently

70
00:03:27,521 --> 00:03:32,470
about uh rehydrating and they were
talking about like how much more people

71
00:03:32,471 --> 00:03:35,080
rehydrate if they're around things that
taste good.

72
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:38,830
Like if you have like sugary drinks,
like gatorade type drink,

73
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:41,320
like how much more you'll drink than if
it's just water,

74
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:42,780
right?
Yeah,

75
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:44,340
we're just gross.
We're gross.

76
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,430
Slovenly and sugars,
like those simple sugars,

77
00:03:48,431 --> 00:03:51,580
like those are really not good for you
mean you didn't get away with eating

78
00:03:51,581 --> 00:03:55,600
them after you work out because your
body is sorta glucose craving,

79
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,440
but the reality of those kinds of sports
drinks and stuff like that,

80
00:03:59,441 --> 00:04:01,390
it's like this,
then I'll fucking healthy for you at

81
00:04:01,391 --> 00:04:03,230
all.
This are corn syrup when liquid.

82
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,950
Yeah,
motherfuckers.

83
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:10,730
Well I think most of the sports drinks
or are owned by companies that produce

84
00:04:10,731 --> 00:04:11,410
soft drinks.

85
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:13,420
Yeah,
I'm sure a lot of them are for sure.

86
00:04:13,421 --> 00:04:16,000
A lot of them are for sure.
But they say the chocolate milk is the

87
00:04:16,001 --> 00:04:17,470
best thing to drink right after your
workout.

88
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:21,200
Is that true?
I guess it depends who you talk to.

89
00:04:21,201 --> 00:04:23,770
You and I,
I think this is based on some studies

90
00:04:23,771 --> 00:04:27,220
that they've done,
but if you talk to anyone that's in the

91
00:04:27,221 --> 00:04:30,520
Chinese medicine or like my wife's
really into Ayurvedic Medicine,

92
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:34,030
milk is the demon.
It's like,

93
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,960
what do they say?
They see it's drinking plus and then oak

94
00:04:37,961 --> 00:04:40,270
is drinking pus.
How's it drinking?

95
00:04:40,271 --> 00:04:41,590
Pus,
they hate milk.

96
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,660
Who are these people?
Well,

97
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,600
anybody.
Have they ever eaten cookies because

98
00:04:46,601 --> 00:04:48,280
milk without cookies.
It's just bullshit.

99
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:50,360
Cookies without milk.
Crowded.

100
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:51,470
Yeah.
There's a,

101
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:56,470
there's a lot of people into this method
of eating and you know,

102
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:58,420
eating for your body type and
everything.

103
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,270
And anyone that's a,
there's three things in Chinese medicine

104
00:05:01,271 --> 00:05:02,280
that caused a lot of phlegm.

105
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:06,460
And in Chinese medicine,
phlegm is not only what you hack up when

106
00:05:06,461 --> 00:05:07,780
you're exercising,
but also,

107
00:05:07,781 --> 00:05:10,510
uh,
energy blockages in the system.

108
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:14,380
So the top of the list is dairy.
Uh,

109
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:16,780
second is peanuts.
In third or bananas,

110
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,600
you can't eat peanuts.
And you can't eat bananas.

111
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:21,790
No.
What kind of communist bullshit is this?

112
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:24,440
What are they trying to say?
Huh?

113
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:27,550
Bananas.
I know what the Fuck is wrong with

114
00:05:27,551 --> 00:05:28,480
bananas,
man.

115
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,810
I don't know if I buy this Chinese
medicine shelf and I live the people

116
00:05:31,811 --> 00:05:33,640
that brought you rhino horns for hard
ons.

117
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:35,450
Isn't that the same folk it is?
Uh,

118
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:37,510
yeah.
They do all sorts of crazy stuff.

119
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:39,790
How about tiger bone make you strong?
No,

120
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:43,210
it won't just kills fucking tiger.
Tom Ass.

121
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:45,520
Yeah.
So I take all this stuff with a grain of

122
00:05:45,521 --> 00:05:47,260
salt.
You think back at some of the

123
00:05:47,261 --> 00:05:49,720
misconceptions you had in your youth
about sex,

124
00:05:49,721 --> 00:05:51,040
and it really is hilarious.

125
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:55,000
I was under the impression that you
needed what was called at the time a

126
00:05:55,001 --> 00:05:56,980
scumbag,
which was a condom.

127
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:58,460
A rubber.
These are called that.

128
00:05:58,461 --> 00:06:01,000
It was a condom.
That's where a scumbag comes from.

129
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:01,970
It was called a,
yeah.

130
00:06:01,971 --> 00:06:05,000
A condom was a scumbag back in the old
days.

131
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,830
Wow.
And this was when I was a kid.

132
00:06:06,831 --> 00:06:10,880
So I had never used that term.
But I heard my parents say that my dad's

133
00:06:10,881 --> 00:06:12,050
friends,
you know?

134
00:06:12,051 --> 00:06:13,950
Yeah.
I didn't have a scumbag last night,

135
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,730
so shit like that.
I know.

136
00:06:16,731 --> 00:06:20,180
It's hilarious.
So I thought you needed one to get a

137
00:06:20,181 --> 00:06:23,270
girl pregnant.
I thought the shit that was on it got

138
00:06:23,271 --> 00:06:25,310
the girl pregnant.
Yeah.

139
00:06:25,311 --> 00:06:26,990
Yeah.
And uh,

140
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,180
and I thought you had a fucker in the
ass.

141
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,970
Like I didn't know that there was a
vagina.

142
00:06:31,971 --> 00:06:32,870
I just thought,
you know,

143
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:35,390
is an ass you've so you fucker in the
ass.

144
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:37,700
Why with a condom and she has a kid,
why

145
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,610
you off?
But the fucked up thing is now I fucked

146
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:46,550
girls don't want to have a kid so I
don't wear a condom and I fucked him on

147
00:06:46,551 --> 00:06:49,490
the policy.
So it did have some kind of an influence

148
00:06:49,491 --> 00:06:54,491
on my future when I was in high school,
and I don't remember where I learned

149
00:06:55,011 --> 00:06:58,730
this or if it was taught in class,
but I specifically remember something

150
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:01,260
where it was,
it was like a real source where they

151
00:07:01,261 --> 00:07:05,000
were saying that in order for a woman to
get pregnant that she has to have an

152
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:07,640
orgasm.
Because when a woman has an orgasm,

153
00:07:07,641 --> 00:07:10,070
it opens up the canal and the eggs get
through.

154
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:13,970
I remember like there's been some just
ridiculously ignorant shit that I was

155
00:07:13,971 --> 00:07:15,170
taught.
Yeah,

156
00:07:15,171 --> 00:07:15,861
that is,
I,

157
00:07:15,861 --> 00:07:17,990
I would,
I would think may because of the

158
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,550
moisture,
you know,

159
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:23,660
it gives a little more fluid for the
sperm cells to swim up,

160
00:07:23,661 --> 00:07:25,570
but it was like a door was only good at
anyway,

161
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:27,920
like tall planing it,
like a door was opening.

162
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:32,380
There's like 1980s healthcare shit.
I Dunno if they didn't know back then or

163
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:35,240
they just,
it was an older even textbook where they

164
00:07:35,241 --> 00:07:38,120
were just ridiculous.
That sounds like something you'd tell a

165
00:07:38,121 --> 00:07:38,780
girl,
like,

166
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:40,760
so you could come in there,
look,

167
00:07:40,761 --> 00:07:43,340
I won't give you an Oregon.
You'll be fine.

168
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:46,180
As long as they don't make you calm when
I'm making any payments.

169
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:48,710
And then after I come,
I'll make you come.

170
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:55,820
Nothing better than that.
