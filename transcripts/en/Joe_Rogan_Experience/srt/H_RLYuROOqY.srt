1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,830
Yeah,

2
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:05,180
three,
two,

3
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:05,930
one.

4
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:11,640
Is that a,
is that a gun?

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,180
That was a weird point.
That was not.

6
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:17,370
It wasn't sure if that was the gun.
Chris Ryan.

7
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:19,110
Hey,
I'm good dude.

8
00:00:19,111 --> 00:00:21,780
The Van van anthropology out there,
man.

9
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:24,780
What do you do to events and I call her.
You just traveling in that thing.

10
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:26,700
I just got back from a month on the 
road.

11
00:00:26,701 --> 00:00:27,760
Yeah.
Wow.

12
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:30,360
To New Orleans and back.
I was just New Orleans too,

13
00:00:30,361 --> 00:00:32,280
but it only took three hours.
Yeah,

14
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:37,550
I took the scenic route.
How many days did it take to drive New 

15
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:37,550
Orleans?
Uh,

16
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:38,880
you know,
we stopped a lot along the way,

17
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,050
but uh,
it's,

18
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,630
I dunno,
10,

19
00:00:42,631 --> 00:00:45,000
12 days or something like that.
You want to stop?

20
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,010
We actually,
we went down along the border.

21
00:00:47,011 --> 00:00:50,060
We,
we were in Bisbee a standard now.

22
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:51,910
He was in Asia.
He was um,

23
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:53,300
you know,
Southeast Asia.

24
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:56,720
It,
like when you think of [inaudible],

25
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:59,700
you think of Stan up in extra ball at 
this point.

26
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:04,520
It's not much of a reason to go to.
You say you didn't visit standard.

27
00:01:04,521 --> 00:01:07,020
Like if she went to Phoenix and didn't 
visit a guy that you knew there,

28
00:01:07,021 --> 00:01:07,920
it's like,
I'm sorry man,

29
00:01:07,921 --> 00:01:09,170
I got really busy.
Yes,

30
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:11,310
that's normal.
But if you went to Brisbane,

31
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,400
didn't visit Stan Hope.
Yeah.

32
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:15,150
How many people are in Brisbane?
I don't know,

33
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:20,180
but there are low.
It's a strange little place if you've 

34
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:20,180
been there.
No scared.

35
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:24,290
It's like this giant open pit mine and 
like the hills are all kind of purple 

36
00:01:25,171 --> 00:01:28,050
and weird colors because it's all slag 
from the mine.

37
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:28,980
Really?
Yeah.

38
00:01:28,981 --> 00:01:32,190
It's.
It's a toxic looking place.

39
00:01:32,191 --> 00:01:37,191
I got to say.
I don't know why anyone would choose to 

40
00:01:37,191 --> 00:01:39,891
live their real estate crashes.
Dr Chris Ryan Trash has been going down.

41
00:01:42,211 --> 00:01:44,850
I'm not saying anything that isn't 
pretty obvious.

42
00:01:44,851 --> 00:01:48,480
If you drive through town,
I'm sure they're a nice parts of town.

43
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,010
I don't know.
We just drove through.

44
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:54,090
I was.
The coolest thing about this van is I've

45
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:59,150
combined it with the podcast and so I'm 
traveling and I'm also meeting people 

46
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:02,160
along the way.
Some of which are planned,

47
00:02:02,161 --> 00:02:05,010
like if Stan hope had been around and 
was willing to hang,

48
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:09,060
definitely would've hung with them,
but others just come up like,

49
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:11,550
uh,
right near Bisbee.

50
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,580
See people follow me on social media and
they're like,

51
00:02:14,581 --> 00:02:15,690
oh,
I see you're in Texas.

52
00:02:15,691 --> 00:02:18,300
You should visit my buddy in Terlingua.
And I did.

53
00:02:18,301 --> 00:02:19,530
And I'll tell you that starting a 
minute,

54
00:02:19,531 --> 00:02:20,830
but near,
um,

55
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,130
bisbee this woman,
Dorothy,

56
00:02:23,131 --> 00:02:24,750
I think her name was,
wrote to me and she's like,

57
00:02:24,751 --> 00:02:26,190
dude,
you're in southern Arizona.

58
00:02:26,191 --> 00:02:31,191
You gotta drop in on my buddy,
the rattle snake guy who's been studying

59
00:02:32,221 --> 00:02:37,221
rattle snakes for 50 years by himself.
He's not looking for fame or anything,

60
00:02:38,761 --> 00:02:40,020
but I'll talk to him.
I think he'd,

61
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,990
he'd like you and you guys would enjoy 
each other's company.

62
00:02:42,991 --> 00:02:44,280
And so I'm like,
sure,

63
00:02:44,281 --> 00:02:46,260
I'll talk to the rattle snake guy.
Perfect.

64
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:49,080
So he came out to this camp site and we 
hung out for the morning.

65
00:02:49,081 --> 00:02:51,000
The Sky is amazing.
Uh,

66
00:02:51,001 --> 00:02:54,510
John Porter is his name.
He's been studying snakes for 50 years.

67
00:02:54,511 --> 00:02:59,470
He's just totally interested in them,
lives on next to nothing in a trailer in

68
00:02:59,471 --> 00:03:00,040
the desert.

69
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:03,970
That's his focus has been bit 15 times.
Jesus.

70
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,290
What keeps you fucking with snakes after
byte number 11?

71
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,370
Yeah,
I know.

72
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:12,340
Full Bite me 10 times.
Shame on me.

73
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:14,830
This is bullshit.
This job sucks.

74
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:16,810
Like how many years has he been doing 
it?

75
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,370
Fifty years.
50.

76
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,260
He's almost 70.
That's incredible.

77
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:24,280
And he's in really good shape.
He scrambles around in the hills and and

78
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:27,040
pull snakes out of holes and.
Wow.

79
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,570
Yeah,
he's a.

80
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:30,490
he's a really interesting cat and he's 
just like,

81
00:03:30,491 --> 00:03:32,500
that's his passion.
That's what he does.

82
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:37,530
Now,
did he do the slow amount of venom in 

83
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:38,990
his system to try to make himself 
immune?

84
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:43,090
You can't be immune to it because what I
learned from him,

85
00:03:43,091 --> 00:03:48,091
one of the many things I learned from 
him is that rattle snake venom is 

86
00:03:48,091 --> 00:03:52,351
essentially digestive enzymes.
And what what happens is they bite an 

87
00:03:53,171 --> 00:03:56,080
animal.
The animal runs off 20 feet or something

88
00:03:56,081 --> 00:03:57,100
before it collapses.

89
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:02,430
The enzymes are digesting the animal 
from within because they don't have 

90
00:04:04,481 --> 00:04:09,481
enough enzymes within their own 
digestive tract to digest the whole 

91
00:04:09,481 --> 00:04:09,990
thing from outside.
Right?

92
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:14,260
So when they get the animal inside them,
they're digesting it simultaneously from

93
00:04:14,261 --> 00:04:17,230
outside in and then from inside out 
cheap.

94
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:21,520
So that's why.
What a monster these are,

95
00:04:21,521 --> 00:04:22,750
um,
the snakes that,

96
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:27,940
that strike a warm blooded animals.
And then the ones that eat cold blooded 

97
00:04:28,151 --> 00:04:29,950
animals,
they have the neurotoxins.

98
00:04:29,951 --> 00:04:34,951
That's a different type of.
Here's a terrifying video that I put on 

99
00:04:34,951 --> 00:04:38,281
my instagram a couple of years ago.
I think you said rattlesnake one,

100
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:40,390
you'll never find it.
It's like way back there.

101
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:41,590
Jamie smiled.
It's a call.

102
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,240
It's a challenge.
Uh,

103
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:46,150
I retweet it or repost it.
Somebody else's.

104
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:49,540
Some guys were hunting and a rattle 
snake was pulling a rabbit.

105
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:55,410
And just the way this demon thing just 
pulled this poor little fuzzy rabbit.

106
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,050
But I instantly made the 
differentiation.

107
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:04,150
I instantly differentiated which one I 
was on team whose team I'm on.

108
00:05:04,271 --> 00:05:05,230
I'm on team,
fluffy,

109
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:06,810
fluffy,
and furry roadways.

110
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:09,400
Anything that's very well,
unless,

111
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:11,920
unless you've got a gun or a bow in your
hands,

112
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:15,430
well to eat it.
I think the most delicious.

113
00:05:15,431 --> 00:05:15,840
Oh No,
no.

114
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:17,930
I'm not judging it at all,
but what I'm saying is it's.

115
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:21,010
But if something else was going after 
that snake,

116
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:23,560
if somebody had killed,
it's like a coyote had killed a snake.

117
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:28,830
I really wouldn't be bothered by it or 
something that bothers me for whatever 

118
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:32,611
weird reason.
I think of a rabbit as being not just a 

119
00:05:32,611 --> 00:05:32,730
rodent enlightened form there.
I mean,

120
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:36,850
I think of it being like fucking Peter 
cottontail or something stupid like that

121
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,320
stuff's in your head.
Herbivores.

122
00:05:38,321 --> 00:05:39,790
They're innocent,
right?

123
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:41,980
They're not out there fucking with other
animals.

124
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:44,650
So it's kind of like very few 
herbivores.

125
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:48,400
Sometimes they eat the birds,
the birds when they can,

126
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:50,890
but they're more just opportunistic.
If a bird can't move,

127
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,320
they'll eat a baby bird.
Right?

128
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:54,660
Yeah.
What is this steak?

129
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:56,620
First Rabbit?
No,

130
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,290
it's actually dragging a rabbit in the 
desert.

131
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:03,170
It looks like we're in the mountain.
This is the one where the moms saves the

132
00:06:03,171 --> 00:06:04,430
babies.
Oh,

133
00:06:04,431 --> 00:06:07,940
is that what it was?
That happened to me once.

134
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,590
I'll give this to mom.
Rabbit comes over.

135
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,330
Oh,
she sees what's going on.

136
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,130
Wow.
That is crazy.

137
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:17,250
That is fucking crazy.
No,

138
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:19,240
that's not the one.
This one was a rattlesnake.

139
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:20,990
A big ass rattle snake.
And it was dry,

140
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:26,020
it was just the way it was dragging this
rabbet around was so intense when I was 

141
00:06:27,171 --> 00:06:27,790
a kid,
I,

142
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,830
I used to think I was an Indian,
you know,

143
00:06:29,831 --> 00:06:32,680
and I'd wander around the neighborhood 
than a loin cloth.

144
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:36,030
Are you allowed to do that today or 
would you get culturally appropriate for

145
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,760
someone to come after you?
I probably,

146
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:44,880
I mean indecent exposure to because it 
wasn't wearing underwear.

147
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:49,930
Oh you terrible person.
But with going cloth made out of bath 

148
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:50,960
towel,
herbal bath towel.

149
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:55,760
So it just folded in thirds and I have a
belt come up with a handgun in the front

150
00:06:55,761 --> 00:06:57,320
and the back.
Seriously,

151
00:06:57,321 --> 00:06:59,090
I was totally into it.
But anyway,

152
00:06:59,091 --> 00:07:03,170
I was wondering around the neighborhood 
in my Indian thing and uh,

153
00:07:03,171 --> 00:07:08,171
I saw this rabbit and there was a bush 
with these hard little fruits on it and 

154
00:07:08,171 --> 00:07:09,650
I grabbed on these fruits and I threw it
at the rabbit.

155
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:14,270
I fucking hit it [inaudible] the rabbit 
started flopping and boom,

156
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,430
just laid there.
I was like,

157
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:19,700
I just killed that fucking with a piece 
of fruit with a hard,

158
00:07:19,701 --> 00:07:24,701
like little crab apple or something.
So I walk over and look at the rabbit 

159
00:07:24,701 --> 00:07:26,030
and it's just laying there and then I 
hear the squeak,

160
00:07:26,031 --> 00:07:26,840
squeak,
squeak,

161
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:31,400
squeak under this pine tree.
And I go and there's this nest of little

162
00:07:31,401 --> 00:07:33,860
baby rabbits with their eyes still 
closed.

163
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:38,270
Little tiny ones.
I just fucking killed their mother dude.

164
00:07:38,271 --> 00:07:40,340
I was like,
oh,

165
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:41,300
what a bummer.

166
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:45,390
I uh,
so I took the babies home crying.

167
00:07:45,391 --> 00:07:47,250
She really did kill the mother with a 
crab.

168
00:07:47,251 --> 00:07:52,251
Apple should have been major league.
He should've been playing for the 

169
00:07:52,251 --> 00:07:52,500
dodgers.
Well,

170
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:53,670
chicken,
I kind of pitch.

171
00:07:53,671 --> 00:07:56,970
So I took the babies home and the next 
door neighbor,

172
00:07:56,971 --> 00:08:01,971
my friend's mother was a nurse and I 
showed her and she had like a syringe 

173
00:08:02,131 --> 00:08:07,131
without the needle and she showed me you
have to mix a can't give them straight 

174
00:08:07,131 --> 00:08:10,290
milk because the rabbit milk is thinner 
so you have to mix water with it and all

175
00:08:10,291 --> 00:08:11,780
this stuff.
And I was feeding them and,

176
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:15,300
and then I went back actually a little 
while later,

177
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:16,540
maybe,
I don't know,

178
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:19,590
the next day or something and the,
the big rabbit was gone.

179
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:23,250
Which then later in life I thought maybe
it wasn't dead,

180
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:27,570
maybe it was faking it to try to save 
the babies to distract me

181
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,250
more likely coyote.
It,

182
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:32,420
it made me just a knockout.
You knocked out the rabbit.

183
00:08:32,421 --> 00:08:37,421
That makes sense because if you get hit 
in the head with something that you 

184
00:08:37,421 --> 00:08:39,881
don't see coming,
it's very likely your branch could just 

185
00:08:39,881 --> 00:08:39,881
shut off,
right?

186
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:41,290
Yeah.
So anyway,

187
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:45,130
I raised these rabbits.
I'm until,

188
00:08:45,131 --> 00:08:47,140
I don't know,
a few weeks until their eyes opened.

189
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:48,370
Wow.
Yeah.

190
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:50,610
And then we'll do them boil them or 
from.

191
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:51,450
Yeah,
no.

192
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:56,220
Then we had to go visit my,
my uncle in Ohio

193
00:08:56,340 --> 00:09:01,340
and I left the rabbits with this girl 
and told her how to take care of them 

194
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:02,520
and all that.
And uh,

195
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,690
the girl apparently forgot about mixing 
the water.

196
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:10,530
And so by the time I got back after a 
three day weekend,

197
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,020
a couple of them had died,
but she didn't want to tell me.

198
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,650
And you know,
we were 10,

199
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:18,810
11 and actually it was all through the 
biology teacher.

200
00:09:18,811 --> 00:09:23,811
And then it turned out,
by the time that she told they were all 

201
00:09:23,811 --> 00:09:24,120
dead,
they all just died.

202
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,580
They probably would have had a hard go 
of it anyway.

203
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:28,260
Yeah.
Yeah.

204
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:32,190
That's crazy.
Maybe you missed your calling baseball.

205
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,500
Baseball.
So boring.

206
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:39,830
It's definitely boring.
It's one of those things that you 

207
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:39,830
couldn't.
And people right now are screaming,

208
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:40,860
fuck you.
Your fans hate me.

209
00:09:40,861 --> 00:09:41,980
Anyway.
Stats.

210
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:43,710
No,
that's definitely not true.

211
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:46,140
I see it occasionally attention to those
comments.

212
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:52,080
They're amusing.
They're only the people that would 

213
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:52,080
comment something shitty.
Yeah.

214
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,600
They're the only ones that are going to 
get to you to also.

215
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:58,610
There's a lot of Kuk Beta stuff,
the because they assume I am in an open 

216
00:09:58,891 --> 00:10:01,920
relationship and so therefore there's 
all that kind of stuff.

217
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:04,050
You're that cut thing.
That's interesting.

218
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:09,080
Anyone who would call someone else a 
cook or a Beta male is most likely.

219
00:10:10,201 --> 00:10:15,201
I don't think you could say anyone 
because sometimes people just are and 

220
00:10:15,201 --> 00:10:17,610
some people say it and they're correct,
but I think been the most part.

221
00:10:17,611 --> 00:10:20,550
But why would you just shut that?
You're not in an argument.

222
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:22,560
Okay.
You aren't in an argument with them,

223
00:10:22,561 --> 00:10:25,230
you don't know them.
You guys aren't so widely insulting you.

224
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:27,510
Why are they going after?
It's because of insecurity.

225
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:32,780
Let's also,
because of this weird way of expressing 

226
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:32,780
each other ourselves on,
on instant,

227
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:33,810
you know,
on twitter,

228
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:39,140
facebook and stuff to instant,
that instantaneous ability to just go 

229
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:39,420
after something.

230
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:44,420
You don't meet them,
you don't establish a friendship with 

231
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:44,420
them.
You don't talk to them is why I'm saying

232
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:44,970
it's a reflection.
As a psychologist,

233
00:10:44,971 --> 00:10:47,120
I find it really interesting because 
it's an,

234
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:47,970
it's,
it's,

235
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:51,270
you know,
you see these guys every fucking day.

236
00:10:51,271 --> 00:10:55,290
There's another story about an anti gay,
you know,

237
00:10:55,291 --> 00:11:00,210
minister who's been sucking little boys 
Dick's everyday or even big black guy,

238
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:03,960
Dick,
whatever is available dixies into.

239
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:05,910
But if he's trying to like pray the gay 
away.

240
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:07,140
Yeah,
for sure.

241
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,880
There's some gates going on somewhere.
I think we reveal our deepest secrets in

242
00:11:11,881 --> 00:11:14,280
our loudest accusations.
I think you're right.

243
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:15,600
You know,
and so this whole,

244
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:20,960
the trolling and stuff going on online 
is interesting because people don't 

245
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:23,100
realize that they're exposing 
themselves,

246
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:24,780
you know?
Yeah.

247
00:11:24,781 --> 00:11:25,940
Well,
it's also,

248
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:30,990
it's a really shitty way of interacting 
with humans that some people participate

249
00:11:30,991 --> 00:11:35,991
in almost exclusively,
like there's some people right now in 

250
00:11:35,991 --> 00:11:37,260
our culture that they're communicating 
with people,

251
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:39,300
but the people that they're 
communicating with,

252
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:44,360
their,
their only communicating with people 

253
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:44,430
online,
they're only doing it through twitter or

254
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:49,460
facebook or however they do it,
so like their days are spent interacting

255
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:54,010
just randomly with people tweeting at 
them

256
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,020
and reading tweets or reading,
you know,

257
00:11:56,050 --> 00:12:01,050
reading message board posts or posting 
things or reading instagram passages.

258
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:07,300
All they're doing is interacting with 
people online and I just think there's a

259
00:12:07,301 --> 00:12:10,480
lot of kids developing that way because 
they're not even.

260
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,740
Even when they're around each other,
they're spending more time communicating

261
00:12:14,741 --> 00:12:19,741
with people through a device than they 
are doing it face to face because 

262
00:12:19,741 --> 00:12:22,480
they're always distracted and I feel 
like this is a very.

263
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:27,060
It's not indicative of how we evolved 
like these,

264
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:31,360
this method of communication.
So like people say there's way more hate

265
00:12:31,361 --> 00:12:33,820
today than it's ever been before.
I don't think so.

266
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:38,940
I think it's the same amount of hate.
There's just this new weird form of 

267
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:42,361
expression that doesn't make you take 
into consideration the other people's 

268
00:12:42,361 --> 00:12:45,061
feelings.
It's like the only time we've ever had 

269
00:12:45,061 --> 00:12:47,401
something like that,
like if you killed someone or you beat 

270
00:12:47,401 --> 00:12:47,830
someone up and you looked at them and 
they looked at you and you knew that you

271
00:12:47,831 --> 00:12:51,010
hated them,
at least that's an honest attack,

272
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:54,970
but if you're.
If you want something terrible to happen

273
00:12:54,971 --> 00:12:58,270
to someone and you don't even know them,
he just heard him on a podcast.

274
00:12:58,271 --> 00:13:03,271
He was a guest and he annoyed Usi want 
terrible things to happen to them like 

275
00:13:03,271 --> 00:13:03,520
you're not even.
You don't even know.

276
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,320
It's like traffic,
anger,

277
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,920
you know,
fuck you like that guy in that car.

278
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:11,490
I know where that comes from.
The right traffic.

279
00:13:11,491 --> 00:13:16,491
Anger comes from a heightened sense of 
awareness because you're going so fast 

280
00:13:16,491 --> 00:13:16,890
because you're in your car.
Scared.

281
00:13:16,891 --> 00:13:17,380
Yeah,
well,

282
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:22,490
you're ramped up.
You're looking constantly for anything 

283
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:23,370
to go wrong.
You can't be at zero and just drive.

284
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:28,400
When you're driving,
you're very aware that you're at the 

285
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,711
wheel of a big fucking thing that had 
car accidents happen and people die on 

286
00:13:30,711 --> 00:13:30,720
them.
Everybody's aware of that.

287
00:13:30,721 --> 00:13:32,310
So you get,
you get ramped up.

288
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:37,510
Although it's funny.
I wrote a motorcycle everyday for about 

289
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:39,140
seven years and uh,
I felt very calm on the motorcycle.

290
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:43,430
I think [inaudible] freedom.
It's freedom and vulnerability.

291
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:47,330
Do you have both the Gemma Harley BMW.
I knew it.

292
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:52,600
I'm a guy.
I'm not a Harley guy and some European 

293
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:52,600
thing.
Fine,

294
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:54,500
fine.
Low Center of gravity.

295
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:56,630
Yeah.
I drove that like a grandpa too.

296
00:13:56,631 --> 00:14:01,631
I was like,
I never got pulled over because in span 

297
00:14:01,631 --> 00:14:01,631
I never had a Spanish audience.
Really?

298
00:14:01,631 --> 00:14:06,490
Yeah.
That's amazing because I shouldn't say 

299
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:06,490
that online.
Probably not.

300
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:08,520
It's too late now.
About um,

301
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:09,560
yeah.
But,

302
00:14:09,561 --> 00:14:11,200
uh,
the thing in Spanish,

303
00:14:11,201 --> 00:14:14,620
it's funny because if you come from,
you know,

304
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:15,940
Mexico,
Uganda,

305
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:20,950
wherever,
and you immigrate to Spain and you get 

306
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:24,491
residency,
you have to turn in your driver's 

307
00:14:24,491 --> 00:14:24,491
license and they'll give you a Spanish 
license.

308
00:14:24,491 --> 00:14:28,511
Right.
The only country where they won't honor 

309
00:14:28,511 --> 00:14:28,511
your license is United States.
Wow.

310
00:14:28,511 --> 00:14:33,310
You got to go to driving school,
that bullshit night school for six 

311
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:35,510
weeks,
take the ridiculous test that's designed

312
00:14:35,511 --> 00:14:40,511
to trick you and it's the translation 
into English is incomprehensible it and 

313
00:14:40,511 --> 00:14:42,290
then you got to do it again.
It's like 4,000

314
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:47,291
euros.
It's a giant scam and it's only for us 

315
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:51,630
for America.
And the reason is that all the Spanish 

316
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:52,070
kids were to the US doing

317
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:57,110
like high school exchange thing and to 
get it you have to be 18 to get a 

318
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:59,330
driver's license in Spain.
But in the US 16 obviously.

319
00:14:59,331 --> 00:15:04,331
So they would come here and it's 16.
They'd get a driver's license and then 

320
00:15:04,331 --> 00:15:04,331
they'd go back to Spain and say,
hey,

321
00:15:04,331 --> 00:15:06,020
give me the license.
You got to do it.

322
00:15:06,021 --> 00:15:11,021
It's so Spain.
They talked to the American government 

323
00:15:11,021 --> 00:15:11,021
like,
Hey,

324
00:15:11,021 --> 00:15:13,130
stop giving Spanish kids licenses.
And the US is like,

325
00:15:13,131 --> 00:15:14,630
fuck you,
we do it the way we do it.

326
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:17,540
We're number one and let's face.
It was like,

327
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:19,220
all right,
and then fucking Americans.

328
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:24,750
And so now it's this giant pain in the 
ass if you're an American living in 

329
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:24,750
Spain.

330
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:28,890
Oh Man.
So what happens if you get caught and 

331
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:28,890
you don't have a license?
So if you're driving around,

332
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:29,110
you're going to find how much?

333
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:31,590
A few hundred euros.
That seems like a bargain.

334
00:15:31,591 --> 00:15:36,591
So yeah,
that's what I figured they paid over 10 

335
00:15:36,591 --> 00:15:36,591
times in order to.
I was like,

336
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,920
what you do is pretend you're a tourist,
right?

337
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:41,170
Just in town.
Have your passport,

338
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:46,470
you know,
don't have a vehicle registered in your 

339
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:49,171
name.
Not that I would ever do any of these 

340
00:15:49,171 --> 00:15:49,171
things.

341
00:15:49,171 --> 00:15:52,010
Yeah.
I was reading about a ex pats and about 

342
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:55,220
people who just decide to just like go 
and move over to Europe for awhile.

343
00:15:55,310 --> 00:16:00,310
It's totally cup.
Such an adventurous thing to do if you 

344
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:03,441
really think about it as an American 
because Americans are for sure locked 

345
00:16:03,691 --> 00:16:05,880
into our way of thinking.
Like there's A.

346
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:07,890
I don't want to speak for the whole 
group,

347
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:10,830
but when you think of the typical 
American,

348
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:16,070
you think of someone who just.
They like things the way they have them 

349
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:16,620
here.
This is the best.

350
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:20,310
We're number one.
Well those people are getting away from.

351
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:21,720
Yeah,
there's a lot.

352
00:16:21,721 --> 00:16:26,721
But.
But the point is like if you even have 

353
00:16:26,721 --> 00:16:27,450
an a niggling of that and then you 
decided to move to Italy for a year,

354
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:30,000
that will go away.
You will realize like,

355
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:30,690
oh,
okay,

356
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:32,400
whatever.
Form One of the.

357
00:16:32,401 --> 00:16:36,870
I think that's one of the reasons why 
people cling so hard to those norms I go

358
00:16:36,871 --> 00:16:37,920
because they know.

359
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:40,470
I think they know that Cambodia is 
different.

360
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:43,380
And if they were living in Cambodia,
they'd be living like Cambodians.

361
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:46,920
They know that Laos is different.
They know that Vietnam is different.

362
00:16:46,921 --> 00:16:51,921
How could that be?
How could these people in these other 

363
00:16:51,921 --> 00:16:54,051
places be just like you just a person,
but they walk around in a rice patty all

364
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:57,480
day and they pushed an ox and they don't
have cell phones.

365
00:16:57,481 --> 00:16:59,940
Like how did that happen?
Could that have happened to you?

366
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:05,150
Like if you just got a weird roll the 
dice and instead of coming out with a 

367
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:05,150
seven,
you came out with a three.

368
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:06,550
Could you have been in Laos,
if you.

369
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:10,410
Unless you know,
I mean,

370
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:12,840
and uh,
from a Laotians perspective,

371
00:17:12,841 --> 00:17:14,780
he got the 70 and you got the three.
Oh,

372
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:15,710
for sure.
Yeah.

373
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:21,230
Guy Take a cubicle,
job is used to working outside and 

374
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:22,580
beautiful weather else is great.
I've been there.

375
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:24,330
Beautiful,
beautiful country,

376
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:27,060
gorgeous on video.
I've never seen in real life.

377
00:17:27,061 --> 00:17:27,370
But yeah,

378
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:33,740
whole thing is just.
I traveled all through my twenties and 

379
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:34,700
thirties was for that insight.
Yeah.

380
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:39,870
To see it.
You got to see it and you got an 

381
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:39,870
impersonal right?
Yeah.

382
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:43,900
And you gotta move slowly enough that 
you had Joseph Campbell called a d 

383
00:17:45,391 --> 00:17:50,070
tribalization to to understand that you 
from a tribe,

384
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:55,520
right?
Everybody thinks everyone else has an 

385
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:55,520
accent,
but I don't,

386
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:55,520
you know,
there,

387
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:59,560
there are all these biases that we're 
unaware of until you get out and look 

388
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,320
back at yourself and where you came 
from.

389
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:05,580
And so I was,
I was based in Spain for 25 years,

390
00:18:05,581 --> 00:18:07,220
so really,
you know,

391
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:12,290
got into Spanish.
I've lived in Spain longer than I've 

392
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:12,450
lived in any other country.
But you don't speak Spanish.

393
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:17,710
Charter do for Kelly by skt says I 
speak,

394
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,810
I speak badly.
But you speak it.

395
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:25,830
Yeah,
I understand everything and I sound like

396
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:29,160
I gave a talk in Argentina once and they
came up after and they said,

397
00:18:29,161 --> 00:18:30,140
I sounded like,
um,

398
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:35,180
somebody said I sounded like a on Gringo
because I learned Spanish in Catalonia,

399
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:39,360
so I have this very specific accent in 
Spanish,

400
00:18:39,361 --> 00:18:40,670
which I'm totally unaware of.

401
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,660
Of course,
intellectually that makes sense to me,

402
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:46,950
but my brain is like,
what different Spanish acts,

403
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:49,040
how the fuck could you tell?
Well,

404
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:54,050
it's like,
obviously you can take a Spanish person 

405
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:54,050
who learns English in Scotland.
Yeah,

406
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:56,230
they sound Scottish speaking,
right?

407
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:57,780
Yeah,
for sure.

408
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:00,420
Or,
or I mean how many number of people that

409
00:19:00,421 --> 00:19:03,260
come from other countries that speak 
Spanish or speak English rather,

410
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:05,610
but they speak it with the accent of 
their place in India.

411
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:08,340
Even Canadians.
It's so subtle about a boat.

412
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,570
A boat.
Yeah.

413
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:14,740
Yeah.
I went to university and you see here a 

414
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:14,890
few times and they're a little bit too 
polite.

415
00:19:14,891 --> 00:19:15,720
You're like,
Hey,

416
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:20,610
I love fucking with Canadians.
We asked them where they're from or what

417
00:19:20,611 --> 00:19:22,110
part of the states are you from,
and they say,

418
00:19:22,111 --> 00:19:22,830
well,
I'm from Canada.

419
00:19:22,831 --> 00:19:23,250
And like,
yeah,

420
00:19:23,251 --> 00:19:23,940
yeah,
whatever.

421
00:19:23,941 --> 00:19:28,941
Yeah,
you're James Brown has a song called 

422
00:19:28,941 --> 00:19:33,261
living in the USA and he goes through 
and you know how he does like he calls 

423
00:19:33,261 --> 00:19:35,890
out cities,
Pittsburgh,

424
00:19:35,891 --> 00:19:40,891
PA,
let's live in the North America.

425
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:43,860
So I guess that's his thing,
right?

426
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,580
Mexico,
there's North America to.

427
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:48,390
Isn't that crazy?
I shared as North America,

428
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:49,560
my first,
uh,

429
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:55,010
apartment in Barcelona.
I shared with this guy named Roy Leo 

430
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:58,461
from Rohelio Gutierrez from Columbia.
Got This fucking serious name and I was 

431
00:19:58,561 --> 00:20:01,290
just learning Spanish then.
And uh,

432
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:06,680
he got,
he got really pissed off at me when I 

433
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,320
said I was American because he's like,
we're all Americans,

434
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:08,120
dude.
Colombia,

435
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:11,960
South America.
America is the whole Western Hemisphere.

436
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:16,980
You arrogant fucking need interface.
That's what I had to learn to say in 

437
00:20:17,761 --> 00:20:19,740
Spanish.
That means from the United States,

438
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:25,560
those states one then say suited dense 
or united.

439
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:28,380
Yeah.
So I used to remember that.

440
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:32,970
I just remember who stato stabbing you 
speak any foreign language?

441
00:20:32,971 --> 00:20:34,530
No,
no.

442
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:38,130
I took A.
I took Italian in college and Spanish in

443
00:20:38,131 --> 00:20:43,131
high school or remembered none of it.
I took three years of German in the 

444
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:48,800
middle school,
high school because I initially signed 

445
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:51,040
up for Spanish,
which would've been the smart move,

446
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:55,450
but then over the summer I was like 
eighth grade I think in over the summer,

447
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:57,520
uh,
this girl named Judy Gumph,

448
00:20:57,670 --> 00:21:00,960
who I just lusted after Judy 
[inaudible],

449
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:06,120
who she was just telling me about Judy 
Judy gown for the 15 year old who was 

450
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:10,831
totally built and gorgeous and smart and
going out with a 23 year old dudes 

451
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:18,120
Camaro and here I am with my zits and 
then braces and I'm thinking I got a 

452
00:21:20,021 --> 00:21:21,160
shot at good judy Gulf.

453
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:24,010
So I,
she was taking German and she said,

454
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:29,040
oh,
but there only eight people in the 

455
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,511
class.
I don't know if they're going to do it 

456
00:21:30,511 --> 00:21:30,511
because you should have nine.
And I was like,

457
00:21:30,511 --> 00:21:33,601
Judy,
I'm going to call the school and switch 

458
00:21:33,601 --> 00:21:35,710
over to chairman.
And I did sat that class for three years

459
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:40,711
with hair.
Flint and Judy never had a shot at judy 

460
00:21:40,711 --> 00:21:41,290
of course.
And then hair.

461
00:21:41,291 --> 00:21:42,640
Flint I,
I could not.

462
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:45,190
I have no talent for language.
I'm like,

463
00:21:45,191 --> 00:21:50,191
I'm all right in English,
but like when you start talking grammar 

464
00:21:50,191 --> 00:21:53,510
and the accusative case and you know,
in German there are three genders in,

465
00:21:53,511 --> 00:21:53,930
in,
you know,

466
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:55,240
there's deed,
their das,

467
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:57,100
masculine,
feminine and neutral,

468
00:21:57,370 --> 00:22:01,390
and every noun has a gender and it's 
like a fucking nightmare.

469
00:22:01,391 --> 00:22:04,630
So as neutral for objects like Das boot.
Yeah,

470
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:05,530
right.
Objects.

471
00:22:05,531 --> 00:22:10,531
But also it's weird because like a 
mentioned girl is neutral and you would 

472
00:22:12,551 --> 00:22:15,990
think girl would have a fucking feminine
gender neutral does,

473
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:17,040
does mention.

474
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:21,910
But anyway,
a hair flint was also the soccer coach.

475
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:27,510
So we sorta had this unspoken agreement 
that if I was on the soccer team he 

476
00:22:28,061 --> 00:22:31,900
would pass me in German even though I 
was lost constantly.

477
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:37,440
I mean I would have failed out for sure,
but he would give me a c as long as I 

478
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:41,491
was on the soccer team.
Not that I was a soccer star is just 

479
00:22:41,491 --> 00:22:44,581
that he needed enough people on the team
that they'd keep paying him or they'd 

480
00:22:44,581 --> 00:22:48,631
shut it down.
So my memory of German is basically 

481
00:22:48,631 --> 00:22:50,020
humiliation from judy gum because I 
never got anywhere,

482
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:55,800
humiliation and the classes I couldn't 
understand the fucking thing and 

483
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:59,521
humiliation on the soccer field because 
not only did I suck at soccer but he 

484
00:22:59,521 --> 00:23:04,471
would scream at me in German.
So I was in the German class so it was 

485
00:23:04,771 --> 00:23:07,450
like God,
it was my tutoring or something.

486
00:23:07,451 --> 00:23:11,100
So like nine dm Copley.
Okay.

487
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:15,000
My Italian class in high school,
there was this really friendly,

488
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:18,360
beautiful Puerto Rican girl.
She was beautiful.

489
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:23,460
Like she was the type of girl that I 
would have been way too nervous to ask 

490
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:24,270
out a way too nervous to approach.
I just wouldn't have need.

491
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,940
I would've needed a bunch of green 
lights to talk to her.

492
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:32,000
I'd be super nervous,
but she would approach me and she's 

493
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:32,000
always inviting me to go places with 
her,

494
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:34,860
her and her friends and I'm like,
well what are you guys doing?

495
00:23:34,861 --> 00:23:36,540
Oh,
we're going to camp out,

496
00:23:36,541 --> 00:23:41,541
we're going to do this thing.
And there was this a getaway for the 

497
00:23:41,541 --> 00:23:42,780
weekend.
Like one of them I couldn't do.

498
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:44,400
So I was.
I was fighting back then,

499
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,100
one of them I couldn't do because I had

500
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:50,900
a fight and one of them I couldn't do 
because I think,

501
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:53,480
I don't remember what the fucking reason
was,

502
00:23:53,481 --> 00:23:58,481
but it was.
It was enough of a reason that I would 

503
00:23:58,481 --> 00:24:00,851
say no.
This hot Puerto Rican girl asked me to 

504
00:24:00,851 --> 00:24:01,050
go somewhere with her on the weekends.
Beta cook behavior show.

505
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:02,840
She was so hot.
She was so hot.

506
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:04,790
She was built like a woman.
I mean we're both.

507
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:09,590
I think I was probably 19 and so she was
probably 19 too.

508
00:24:09,591 --> 00:24:11,780
She was,
she was a phenol mom.

509
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:16,960
I mean her body was just holy shit.
Super duper pretty and super duper 

510
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,100
friendly.
So I'm thinking one day this is going to

511
00:24:19,101 --> 00:24:19,700
happen.
Right?

512
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:25,150
So I go to the lunch room one day and it
was the day that it was the trump 

513
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:26,300
airplane.
I know I've talked about this before.

514
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:31,390
The trump airline,
the runway gear didn't come down and 

515
00:24:31,581 --> 00:24:32,510
it's skid.

516
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:34,730
Like remember when trump had an airline?
Do you remember that?

517
00:24:34,731 --> 00:24:35,570
Vaguely,
yeah.

518
00:24:35,571 --> 00:24:40,571
I had a fucking airline side of it and 
I'm pretty sure it was him or maybe it 

519
00:24:41,361 --> 00:24:43,700
was jet blue.
Now let me think about it.

520
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,240
It might not have been trump or might 
have happened either way.

521
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:51,290
This airplane skid and you know they had
a foam up the runway,

522
00:24:51,291 --> 00:24:56,291
the whole deal and things skin without 
the gear and I showed up and was her and

523
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:58,940
her friends landing gear fails on trump 
jet.

524
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:00,010
No injuries.
Okay.

525
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:01,520
Nineteen 89.
That is it.

526
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:04,720
That's exactly when it was happening.
You were in high school in 1980.

527
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:07,520
That was 89.
That must've been.

528
00:25:07,521 --> 00:25:10,970
I was 21.
No,

529
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,160
that doesn't make sense.
It must have been another one.

530
00:25:13,370 --> 00:25:17,360
See if there was one from earlier 
because when I was 21 or two given up on

531
00:25:17,361 --> 00:25:20,750
the idea of college,
they're going to say,

532
00:25:20,751 --> 00:25:22,190
given up on the idea of her.

533
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:23,060
No.
I was like,

534
00:25:23,061 --> 00:25:24,980
what am I doing?
When I was 21,

535
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:26,780
I was like,
this is just too ridiculous.

536
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:31,930
And then I started doing standup was 
there was a Mexico City air disaster 

537
00:25:33,231 --> 00:25:35,900
believes air international.
Mexico City crash.

538
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:37,070
No,
it wasn't a crash,

539
00:25:37,071 --> 00:25:38,570
it was the same thing with the landing 
gear.

540
00:25:38,571 --> 00:25:40,850
Wouldn't drop down.
Type in airline runway in my memory.

541
00:25:40,851 --> 00:25:43,370
Sucks in Boston.
It wasn't Boston.

542
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:44,150
Oh,
there you go.

543
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:48,350
I just can't imagine that I was 89.
I was 21.

544
00:25:48,770 --> 00:25:51,080
Anyway.
So what happened with a woman and yeah,

545
00:25:51,081 --> 00:25:52,940
no,
it's definitely not 89 because I was uh,

546
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:56,610
I was already doing standup by 89,
so I.

547
00:25:56,930 --> 00:26:01,930
sorry,
I sit down hundreds of thousands of 

548
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:03,110
people that go and just sit down to the 
guys here.

549
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:07,610
What happened today at the airport and 
they'll know what happened.

550
00:26:07,611 --> 00:26:12,611
I go,
this jet came in and the landing gear 

551
00:26:12,611 --> 00:26:13,460
didn't drop so it had a skid across the 
runway.

552
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:15,050
I go,
but everybody's okay.

553
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:17,150
And they all go,
praise God.

554
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,650
Oh,
praise God.

555
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,330
And I went,
oh,

556
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:24,050
that's the weekend getaway.
The weekend getaway.

557
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,330
It's an indoctrination to a Christian 
cult.

558
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:29,210
They were bananas.
They were in.

559
00:26:29,211 --> 00:26:34,211
They were super proselytizing.
They would go everywhere and sit down 

560
00:26:34,211 --> 00:26:35,170
with people that were by themselves.
And if you saw,

561
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:37,820
if they thought you were lonely or an 
outcast,

562
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:43,000
they would send in the hot one,
she would come and sit next to you and 

563
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,040
invite you places and then they'd pull 
you into the fold and they were just

564
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:46,500
recruiting people left and right to 
join.

565
00:26:46,501 --> 00:26:48,960
And then like I noticed as the class 
would go on,

566
00:26:48,961 --> 00:26:53,961
like later in the semester,
I noticed some of the people from the 

567
00:26:53,961 --> 00:26:54,060
class,
we're now in that little tight group and

568
00:26:54,061 --> 00:26:56,190
they'd all hang together.
It was very strange.

569
00:26:56,520 --> 00:27:01,520
It was like I was watching people get,
they got cult it up that was watching it

570
00:27:02,551 --> 00:27:05,970
happen.
But it was all like standard standard,

571
00:27:05,971 --> 00:27:07,380
you know,
Christian stuff,

572
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:12,360
but extremely involved in your life.
Very rabid.

573
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:14,100
And you know,
and recruiting,

574
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:17,100
proselytizing everywhere.
And the fact that this had like,

575
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:19,320
it was very strange because I was like 
cute dummy.

576
00:27:19,321 --> 00:27:22,350
Of course she doesn't like you.
She wants to bring you to Jesus.

577
00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:29,850
You know,
maybe if she was going to fuck you to 

578
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:29,850
Jesus.
I didn't think so.

579
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:31,280
I didn't have much confidence back then,
believe it or not,

580
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:33,740
I didn't think it was going to happen,
you know?

581
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:38,050
Does anyone have confidence at 1920?
Really dumb kids.

582
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:39,840
Yeah,
that's it.

583
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:42,370
When I was 19 I was like,
I couldn't,

584
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:45,030
nothing made any sense.
I might've been 20 when it happened.

585
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:50,080
Yeah,
if you think you got it figured out in 

586
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:50,080
19 or 20,
you're destined for a life,

587
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,170
you know,
stacking shelves somewhere.

588
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:56,350
I can't imagine that it was in an 89.
It doesn't make any sense unless my 

589
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:57,470
whole timeline for when I quit college 
is off.

590
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:03,080
I just finished watching.
I'm binge watching this new netflix 

591
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,110
documentary about the Roger Nishi.
You know,

592
00:28:04,111 --> 00:28:06,600
the Sunday I was in Oregon.
Wild West.

593
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:08,760
Wild wild country while.
Well country.

594
00:28:08,761 --> 00:28:09,840
Yeah.
It's amazing.

595
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:13,590
It's really good.
It's how many six episodes I think.

596
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,900
Yeah,
we just binge watched it.

597
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:18,590
Um,
I have a buddy who was the son Yassa and

598
00:28:18,591 --> 00:28:23,220
for 15 years maybe something like that.
He wasn't in Oregon though.

599
00:28:23,221 --> 00:28:26,220
He was always in India.
But yeah,

600
00:28:26,221 --> 00:28:30,060
that's very interesting.
And the whole sort of appeal of the cult

601
00:28:30,061 --> 00:28:33,390
and the hunger to be part of this 
community.

602
00:28:33,391 --> 00:28:36,390
And it was a very interesting 
documentary.

603
00:28:36,530 --> 00:28:38,370
Yeah.
Well I don't think it's too hot.

604
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:41,220
I don't think it'd be very hard at all 
to start a cult.

605
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:46,580
I just don't think it's very difficult.
I think some people would say you 

606
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:48,450
already have.
Well maybe,

607
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:50,700
but you can do whatever you want.

608
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:51,960
I mean,
no,

609
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:53,070
no,
no.

610
00:28:53,071 --> 00:28:55,900
Uh,
no one's asking you for a.

611
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:57,940
do you have.
Do you have any.

612
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:01,180
You need to step up your game there.
He goes onto the window.

613
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:04,170
Like the instead of the Rolls Royces,
you got the porsches,

614
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:06,410
Porsche,
Porsche Gurus.

615
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:09,210
I'm realizing I like old cars,
old cars.

616
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:12,690
You don't even have to drive as good.
They don't have there a different thing.

617
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:14,790
You ever heard of Mickey Avalon?
Yes.

618
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:19,020
I had him on my podcast recently.
Really interesting and smart guy.

619
00:29:19,770 --> 00:29:24,770
And He,
in addition to being a rapper and 

620
00:29:24,770 --> 00:29:24,770
whatever he does,
he.

621
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:28,260
Simon rex is a good friend of mine,
a dirt nasty.

622
00:29:28,261 --> 00:29:31,260
And the two of them were on tour 
together anyway.

623
00:29:31,261 --> 00:29:36,261
So I was talking with the Mickey and it 
turns out Mickey Restores Antique cars.

624
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:38,850
Wow.
And he's got like 20 of them,

625
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,800
like,
like model t's and shit.

626
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:42,310
Like that's awesome.
Really interesting

627
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:44,000
cars.
They're part,

628
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:46,810
man.
This is what an old car.

629
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:49,240
They're just,
it's a different thing,

630
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:54,420
you know,
it's cool to see the process of them 

631
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:55,940
figuring out how to design cars at 
faster and faster.

632
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:59,610
So his car.
Oh God,

633
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:02,160
that's beautiful.
What is that 61?

634
00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:06,070
Impala.
A Rockford fosgate equipped 61 in Pollo.

635
00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:09,660
I love that sort of art deco lines.
Yeah.

636
00:30:09,670 --> 00:30:12,850
So when he's doing his,
um,

637
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:16,030
and I think that is a,
what they would call Resto Mod.

638
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:18,210
You know what they take an old.
This is,

639
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:21,520
that's the best of both worlds.
They take an old car and they put modern

640
00:30:21,521 --> 00:30:25,600
brakes in modern suspension and they're 
just safer and they ride better.

641
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,950
He could even swap out the engine,
right?

642
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,410
Oh yeah.
They all do.

643
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:31,330
The lot of them do,
I should say,

644
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:34,090
um,
they use modern fuel injected engine.

645
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:36,970
You can buy them from almost all the 
companies,

646
00:30:36,971 --> 00:30:40,000
Ford sales,
crate engines and people put them in old

647
00:30:40,001 --> 00:30:41,590
mustangs,
so it's amazing.

648
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:46,060
I love those old Mustang split rear 
windows to some of those cars are just.

649
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:48,700
You look at them and you're like,
God damn like,

650
00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:49,540
what?
What?

651
00:30:49,541 --> 00:30:51,220
How did they do it?
So good then.

652
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:56,460
And why?
Like you look at those old mustangs are 

653
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:58,831
old corvettes.
Like there are a few years where 

654
00:30:58,831 --> 00:30:58,831
corvettes just couldn't have been more 
beautiful.

655
00:30:58,831 --> 00:31:00,160
Have you ever seen my 19,
65?

656
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:04,480
I don't think so too.
It's to correlate his car I've ever seen

657
00:31:04,481 --> 00:31:06,730
in my life.
I have a 1965 silver,

658
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,290
1965 corvette convertible.
Wow.

659
00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:11,450
Stand.
I just sit in front of it.

660
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:16,920
May have seen it.
Did you and Jay Leno drive around in 

661
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:16,920
that?
Yeah.

662
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:16,920
Were you in Topanga?

663
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:23,610
No.
I remember watching that clip and 

664
00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:23,610
thinking they're dry.
Oh yeah,

665
00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:23,610
look at that.
No,

666
00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:27,810
we went to the Angeles crest highway.
That car is two years older than me sort

667
00:31:28,541 --> 00:31:30,700
of see,
but sort of as the real thing,

668
00:31:30,701 --> 00:31:35,701
like the outside is everything in the 
inside as far as like dashboard and 

669
00:31:35,701 --> 00:31:39,901
stuff is.
So you've had the hip replacements and 

670
00:31:39,901 --> 00:31:39,901
stuff.
Those are joints.

671
00:31:39,901 --> 00:31:43,730
Yeah.
This car has got any of everything in 

672
00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:46,300
that car is modern in terms of like the 
breaks and the engines,

673
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:50,740
engines from a 2007 corvette.
They just do that then that way,

674
00:31:50,770 --> 00:31:55,600
like you're driving around enrolled car,
but it breaks goods at handles good.

675
00:31:55,601 --> 00:31:59,920
It's not a death trap,
but as getting back to the cult thing,

676
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,570
uh,
you know,

677
00:32:01,571 --> 00:32:06,571
I think some of the mechanisms,
the psychological mechanisms that make 

678
00:32:06,571 --> 00:32:10,501
that possible apply to what's happening 
in podcasting these days.

679
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,900
Yes.
And the beautiful thing about podcasting

680
00:32:13,901 --> 00:32:18,901
is so far no one has taken advantage of 
it and started some compound somewhere 

681
00:32:18,901 --> 00:32:22,591
and banged everybody's wife didn't file 
it or we have this thing on and required

682
00:32:25,271 --> 00:32:30,271
you to give up all your financial money.
Worldly goods and patriotic count 

683
00:32:31,091 --> 00:32:36,091
though.
Australian guy that said he was Jesus a 

684
00:32:36,091 --> 00:32:39,410
pretty fucking interesting because 
there's this whole documentary on it and

685
00:32:39,411 --> 00:32:40,340
he has this woman

686
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:44,300
and the woman said that he said that she
was married then,

687
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:49,600
like halfway to the documentary.
You feel that there was another girl in 

688
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,650
the past.
He said she was married to a girl,

689
00:32:51,651 --> 00:32:54,170
thinks she's married and he thinks he's 
Jesus.

690
00:32:54,210 --> 00:32:56,060
It's fucking hilarious.
Well,

691
00:32:56,061 --> 00:32:58,100
Mary was Jesus's mother,
right?

692
00:32:58,670 --> 00:32:59,570
Uh,
yes.

693
00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:04,630
So,
but they're partying together and 

694
00:33:04,630 --> 00:33:04,630
banging because the reincarnated.
So really Mary.

695
00:33:04,630 --> 00:33:08,030
So Jesus was a motherfucker in his,
his own motherfucker.

696
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:11,540
I don't know.
I love my,

697
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:13,700
I don't know.
All right.

698
00:33:13,701 --> 00:33:15,020
She's not married.
The mother.

699
00:33:15,021 --> 00:33:16,940
She's Mary Magdalen the uh.
Oh,

700
00:33:16,941 --> 00:33:21,010
the prostitute.
It's fitting in.

701
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:24,740
Maybe the other.
Mary was the mom is the last gospel.

702
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:30,170
Is that what he says?
Dan Brown?

703
00:33:31,290 --> 00:33:36,290
Yeah.
The Brown was hanging with the hookers 

704
00:33:36,290 --> 00:33:38,510
and very accepting of sex workers.
Yeah.

705
00:33:38,511 --> 00:33:39,440
Why not?
I mean,

706
00:33:39,441 --> 00:33:42,110
God made people horny.
God knew what he was doing,

707
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,960
but God made us monogamous.
Joe.

708
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:46,640
Oh,
get me started.

709
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,540
It's one of the reasons why I wanted to 
have you on.

710
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:53,450
I have an intervention that Weinstein,
yeah,

711
00:33:53,451 --> 00:33:55,520
you're going to get me married,
you know,

712
00:33:55,521 --> 00:34:00,521
um,
I told you in the email that I felt bad 

713
00:34:00,521 --> 00:34:01,850
when your book came up on the show and I
didn't know how to defend it.

714
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:03,650
I didn't know what to do because I 
didn't,

715
00:34:03,890 --> 00:34:08,890
I was in that weird moment where I was 
recommending it because I like it 

716
00:34:08,890 --> 00:34:11,900
because I think it's a great book.
And he was saying that just debunked.

717
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:15,500
Well,
I think he picked data right?

718
00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:17,450
Which is always weird.

719
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:18,910
Well,
the thing is,

720
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:24,090
any sort of popular non science or 
nonfiction book is you have to choose 

721
00:34:25,631 --> 00:34:27,210
what data you're going to include,
right?

722
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:32,220
I mean there's an infinite amount of 
data and so of course you form an 

723
00:34:32,291 --> 00:34:35,860
argument and then you present data that 
supports your argument.

724
00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:38,830
Did you ever consider,
I'm arguing against herself.

725
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:39,890
Sure.
Yeah.

726
00:34:39,910 --> 00:34:41,320
Yeah.
And in fact the book is,

727
00:34:42,010 --> 00:34:47,010
you know,
the book is written as an argument 

728
00:34:47,010 --> 00:34:47,080
against the standard narrative.
So,

729
00:34:47,130 --> 00:34:48,370
you know,
we had to present this.

730
00:34:48,371 --> 00:34:50,500
What is the standard narrative?
Who believes this?

731
00:34:50,501 --> 00:34:55,501
You know,
who thinks that people evolve to as 

732
00:34:55,501 --> 00:34:55,501
monogamous.
And so we quote quite heavily from those

733
00:34:55,501 --> 00:34:56,960
people,
um,

734
00:34:57,010 --> 00:34:58,360
but you know,
the thing is I,

735
00:34:58,530 --> 00:35:00,590
and I really appreciated your email and 
I,

736
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:06,020
you know,
we don't need to talk about this at any 

737
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:08,320
length,
but it's not your job to defend the book

738
00:35:08,410 --> 00:35:11,170
and it's not even my job really to 
defend the book.

739
00:35:11,171 --> 00:35:13,270
I think once a book is out,
it's out.

740
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:14,500
The book is there,

741
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,210
but isn't it,
it's not just the book,

742
00:35:17,390 --> 00:35:22,390
it's when someone goes hard on a book,
it's not about you as well is expression

743
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:26,550
of,
of your

744
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:27,180
work.
But see,

745
00:35:27,181 --> 00:35:31,080
that's the thing,
I don't accept that association.

746
00:35:31,081 --> 00:35:34,320
And so if somebody wants to critique the
book,

747
00:35:34,321 --> 00:35:36,420
that's totally cool and,
and like,

748
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:41,520
look,
are there things that we may have 

749
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,630
misunderstood?
Of course are the things we left out.

750
00:35:42,631 --> 00:35:44,080
Of course there are,
you know,

751
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:47,370
mistakes of course you know,
that you're human.

752
00:35:47,371 --> 00:35:52,371
You made it right.
There are hundreds of citations in that 

753
00:35:52,371 --> 00:35:52,371
book.
Now,

754
00:35:52,371 --> 00:35:53,790
if somebody says,
as people have like,

755
00:35:53,791 --> 00:35:54,680
you know,
uh,

756
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:55,860
Chris Ryan,
you know,

757
00:35:56,040 --> 00:36:01,040
deliberately misrepresented the science 
or doesn't understand the first thing 

758
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:05,361
about evolution or whatever it is,
I just don't engage because the 

759
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:12,520
emotional cycle,
what we were saying earlier about 

760
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,040
comments online,
I think people will react to sex at dawn

761
00:36:14,041 --> 00:36:18,330
very emotionally.
And so if they're reacting emotionally,

762
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:23,360
there's no point in me engaging with 
them because they're expressing some 

763
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:28,910
something that's going on in their lives
that I don't know anything about and I 

764
00:36:28,910 --> 00:36:28,910
don't,
they're suffering in some way.

765
00:36:28,910 --> 00:36:31,770
I'm not talking about Weinstein or 
anybody specifically,

766
00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:36,840
but there's an emotional reason to have 
that kind of reaction.

767
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:40,080
Whereas if somebody says,
look on page 72,

768
00:36:40,081 --> 00:36:45,081
you said that a Benobos are the only ape
that does this and the actually gibbons 

769
00:36:45,081 --> 00:36:46,200
do it as well.
Okay.

770
00:36:46,201 --> 00:36:47,810
We can talk about that,
you know,

771
00:36:47,811 --> 00:36:49,170
that's,
that's factual.

772
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:50,970
So when people say,
oh,

773
00:36:50,971 --> 00:36:51,990
it's cherry picked,
well,

774
00:36:51,991 --> 00:36:54,030
which cherries?
What are you talking about?

775
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:58,530
Specific thing and what's wrong with it?
Instead of saying it's cherry picking is

776
00:36:58,531 --> 00:37:01,590
vast.
General critic critique of the book.

777
00:37:02,530 --> 00:37:04,740
And if it gets about me,
like,

778
00:37:04,741 --> 00:37:06,630
oh,
that's because he wants to get laid,

779
00:37:06,631 --> 00:37:10,800
or one of the arguments was that it 
would be a good book to write.

780
00:37:10,801 --> 00:37:15,801
I think.
I don't remember if he said or if his 

781
00:37:15,801 --> 00:37:15,801
wife said it,
it'd be a good book.

782
00:37:15,801 --> 00:37:15,840
And I really loved those two.

783
00:37:15,990 --> 00:37:17,250
They're great.
They're cool.

784
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:19,190
I just think,
um,

785
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:24,680
when it comes to monogamy and sexuality,
people have a notion in their head and 

786
00:37:25,081 --> 00:37:30,081
that notion almost always aligns with 
how they're living their life or how 

787
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:31,010
they wish they were living their lives.
Yeah.

788
00:37:31,090 --> 00:37:32,100
Maybe.
And again,

789
00:37:32,101 --> 00:37:34,770
we're not talking about specific people 
or I've never met them.

790
00:37:34,771 --> 00:37:37,380
I know they're a great couple.
They're wonderful people.

791
00:37:37,381 --> 00:37:42,381
But I mean there's,
there's something about the subject of 

792
00:37:42,381 --> 00:37:42,570
your book.
I think I told you this before,

793
00:37:42,571 --> 00:37:44,940
without naming any names.
My friend brought your book home and his

794
00:37:44,941 --> 00:37:47,220
wife threw it away.
Yeah.

795
00:37:47,221 --> 00:37:50,960
You and I talked about that on the very 
first podcast actually.

796
00:37:50,990 --> 00:37:54,210
Yeah.
I've run into this a lot,

797
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:59,300
right?
You can imagine cocktail parties with 

798
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:01,311
me.
It can get awkward very quickly for 

799
00:38:01,311 --> 00:38:01,311
sure.
You know,

800
00:38:01,311 --> 00:38:01,311
cause people ask,
oh wait,

801
00:38:01,311 --> 00:38:01,360
you're the guy who.
Yeah,

802
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:06,670
you know,
and then often you'll see some people 

803
00:38:06,670 --> 00:38:07,710
are very eager to hear about it and talk
about it.

804
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:10,950
Other people are just steams coming out 
of their ears.

805
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:12,390
I,
I think,

806
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:17,780
you know,
a lot of people are in relationships 

807
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:20,720
that they're trying to make fit into 
what they believe is the right way to 

808
00:38:22,141 --> 00:38:24,810
have a relationship and often it just 
doesn't.

809
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:30,200
It doesn't work.
And so there's a lot of shame and regret

810
00:38:31,831 --> 00:38:35,500
and resentment and all kinds of negative
energy around that.

811
00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:36,100
And

812
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:41,100
so any discussion where you're saying,
well maybe that's not actually the way 

813
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:46,680
it's meant to work for some people,
that's an incredibly liberating message 

814
00:38:46,870 --> 00:38:49,060
for other people.
It's extremely threatening.

815
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:51,160
Right.
And I understand that.

816
00:38:51,161 --> 00:38:52,200
And,
and you know,

817
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:56,500
so I've become very emotionally sort of 
separate from the book.

818
00:38:56,740 --> 00:39:00,820
It's out there,
it stands or not based on its merits.

819
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:03,520
I don't.
When people get all riled up,

820
00:39:03,521 --> 00:39:05,080
I've learned to just be like,
yeah,

821
00:39:05,081 --> 00:39:06,610
you know what?
That's fine.

822
00:39:06,611 --> 00:39:09,160
That's between you and the book.
That's a very healthy approach.

823
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:10,870
Good for you.
It's just,

824
00:39:10,990 --> 00:39:14,410
to me,
it seems like people that get most upset

825
00:39:14,411 --> 00:39:18,220
about it don't get most upset about it.
For rational reason.

826
00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:21,010
They get upset about it because it 
challenges the way they live their life.

827
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:21,610
Well,
that's.

828
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:24,520
I mean that's what I was saying about 
the gay preachers and stuff.

829
00:39:24,521 --> 00:39:27,660
It's like if you're getting that upset,
that's about you,

830
00:39:27,661 --> 00:39:27,970
man.

831
00:39:27,970 --> 00:39:29,170
It's not.
I mean,

832
00:39:29,171 --> 00:39:30,970
if he disagreed with it,
then disagree with it.

833
00:39:30,971 --> 00:39:33,820
That's fine.
Is out gay preachers,

834
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:38,200
people who love Jesus and are also gay.
You can't do that.

835
00:39:38,201 --> 00:39:43,201
You can't figure that out.
How can this guy can start a whole 

836
00:39:43,201 --> 00:39:45,691
fucking call it in Australia and tell 
people about Jesus and his girlfriend's 

837
00:39:45,691 --> 00:39:48,310
Mary and you guys can't get together and
form yourself a nice gay church.

838
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:50,050
I mean,
do they have them that I don't know.

839
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:53,110
The Vatican Dude,
hey,

840
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:55,510
have you heard all this stuff going on 
in Italy?

841
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:58,960
They've got all their sex parties or 
their own country.

842
00:39:58,961 --> 00:40:03,961
Do you know when I was there when you 
just walk around the Vatican and just 

843
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:10,111
see the vast amount of pilfered riches 
that are all just sucked out by an 

844
00:40:11,201 --> 00:40:12,280
ideology.
I mean,

845
00:40:12,281 --> 00:40:14,290
that's really what it is.
That church,

846
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:17,230
that whatever the fuck you want to call 
it a religion,

847
00:40:17,530 --> 00:40:20,770
they just acquired an ungodly amount of 
wealth.

848
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,260
Literally ungodly,
ungodly.

849
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:25,090
Yeah.
It's fucking stunning.

850
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:27,430
Yeah.
Jesus is all about living in poverty and

851
00:40:27,431 --> 00:40:32,431
hanging out with sex workers and these 
guys are like just lavish wealth and 

852
00:40:32,431 --> 00:40:34,750
it's crazy because if Jesus came back,
the first thing he'd say,

853
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,460
he's like,
what the fuck have you guys done?

854
00:40:36,510 --> 00:40:37,900
Yeah.
Like what have you done?

855
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:41,470
Look at these gigantic places that you 
built and I told you guys,

856
00:40:41,471 --> 00:40:43,210
you don't even have to be anywhere for 
this.

857
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:48,750
You don't.
You don't need to have some ornate 

858
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:51,540
temple with stain glass windows.
And it took craftsman like St Peter's 

859
00:40:51,761 --> 00:40:53,170
Basilica.
Like,

860
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:58,410
is it a shock that that is probably one 
of the most stunning things that I've 

861
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:04,920
ever seen in my life.
Like one of the most beautiful works of 

862
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:07,771
art,
yet was created for this religion that 

863
00:41:07,961 --> 00:41:12,961
most likely the people that were living 
in that day were probably like 

864
00:41:12,961 --> 00:41:17,371
worshiping these people that were 
running this thing because if they were 

865
00:41:17,371 --> 00:41:19,780
dating themselves and they needed them 
to have the biggest,

866
00:41:19,781 --> 00:41:24,781
craziest building that impressed the 
rubes right when they come into the 

867
00:41:24,781 --> 00:41:26,200
country side and they walk into a 
cathedral like,

868
00:41:26,390 --> 00:41:29,140
holy fuck,
the impact that it has on us.

869
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,390
You can't understate it still.
Yeah.

870
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:32,030
Yeah.
And there,

871
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:33,980
there are churches in.
I would go into

872
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:35,510
it and I'm,
I'm a pagan,

873
00:41:35,511 --> 00:41:38,690
but just go in there and just feel the 
space.

874
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:39,710
Yeah,
just feel it.

875
00:41:39,950 --> 00:41:41,930
The distance you just,
you,

876
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:44,690
your body knows how big it is or can 
you.

877
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:46,370
It's like when you walk into an airplane
hangar,

878
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:47,770
you know,
uh,

879
00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:49,080
it's,
it's,

880
00:41:49,230 --> 00:41:52,970
it's not something you really can't 
overemphasize how crazy it is.

881
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:55,730
Like these people built this without 
power tools.

882
00:41:56,060 --> 00:42:01,060
I mean,
I don't know what kind of fucking 

883
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:01,060
ladders they used,
but whatever they did it.

884
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:02,180
Look at that.
Fuck man.

885
00:42:02,530 --> 00:42:03,770
I mean,
it's just crazy.

886
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:07,280
You walk around that place,
you can't believe how ornate it is,

887
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:10,190
but at the same time this was happening.
People were starving,

888
00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:12,950
you know,
guaranteed.

889
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:17,840
Like how old is that?
Fifteen hundred 15.

890
00:42:17,841 --> 00:42:18,290
Oh,
six.

891
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:21,020
How well do you think everybody was 
doing financially in 15?

892
00:42:21,021 --> 00:42:21,440
Oh,
six.

893
00:42:21,441 --> 00:42:22,880
I bet.
Pretty fucking shitty.

894
00:42:23,930 --> 00:42:28,930
I bet everybody that lived around that 
place suffered and these motherfuckers 

895
00:42:28,930 --> 00:42:30,470
were building these crazy places.

896
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:34,610
They have an obelisk in this whole place
where you're these images right here.

897
00:42:34,611 --> 00:42:36,230
Where's Sean from?
Egypt?

898
00:42:36,590 --> 00:42:40,190
This massive stone obelisk from Egypt 
and I was like,

899
00:42:40,191 --> 00:42:42,650
okay,
how the fuck did they get that there?

900
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,920
Yeah.
It shows you how cheap labor was.

901
00:42:46,010 --> 00:42:46,720
Oh,
do.

902
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:49,070
Yeah.
You could hire people for a lifetime,

903
00:42:49,071 --> 00:42:50,120
for a pittance,
you know?

904
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:52,530
Yeah.
Really skilled artisans down.

905
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:53,880
They couldn't go anywhere,
man.

906
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:58,010
What they did in that place,
I mean the Vatican is just a.

907
00:42:58,340 --> 00:43:03,340
it's a stunning place,
like way more so than I thought it was 

908
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:03,340
going to.
Have you been to Spain?

909
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:04,310
No,
I have not looked at that.

910
00:43:04,430 --> 00:43:05,720
Oh my God,
look at that.

911
00:43:08,170 --> 00:43:09,860
That's what is that Jamie?
What are we looking at?

912
00:43:10,430 --> 00:43:13,370
Is that the roof?
Just St Peter's Basilica.

913
00:43:13,850 --> 00:43:17,600
Look at the fucking carving and 
everything and I'm telling you these.

914
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:22,660
It's one of those things like you were 
talking about how you have to see 

915
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:23,780
another culture in per person owner to 
really appreciate it.

916
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:27,800
I think that's the same with this thing.
St Peter's basilica is one of those ones

917
00:43:27,801 --> 00:43:28,700
when you're there,
like,

918
00:43:28,701 --> 00:43:30,650
look how little those people are walking
around down there.

919
00:43:30,830 --> 00:43:32,910
See the top of their heads.
That's it.

920
00:43:33,190 --> 00:43:34,490
Fucking places.
Giant,

921
00:43:35,510 --> 00:43:37,970
beautiful light coming through.
They're unbelievable.

922
00:43:38,030 --> 00:43:38,510
It's,
it's,

923
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:41,150
it's one of those game changers when you
leave,

924
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:46,160
they're like,
to me it was way more impressive than 

925
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:46,370
the calcium.
Calcium is very impressive,

926
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,830
but it wasn't as impressive.
What's not intact,

927
00:43:49,870 --> 00:43:51,740
but it's not even that.
It's just like what it is,

928
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:53,450
what it is,
just craziness.

929
00:43:53,450 --> 00:43:57,110
He's fucking impressive thing was the 
elevator complex.

930
00:43:57,230 --> 00:44:01,340
The dates set up the animals up from the
floor like that is fucking nuts,

931
00:44:01,341 --> 00:44:06,341
man.
Do you ever think about the coliseum 

932
00:44:06,341 --> 00:44:08,501
when you're doing UFC commentary and 
it's kind of like this modern a little 

933
00:44:08,501 --> 00:44:08,501
bit,
right?

934
00:44:08,501 --> 00:44:12,910
Yeah.
It's definitely a big violent 

935
00:44:12,910 --> 00:44:15,020
distraction from everyday life that 
people really look forward to and enjoy,

936
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:17,450
you know,
for like entertainment value.

937
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:22,780
I mean it says it's primal as you can 
get without anybody really dying,

938
00:44:22,990 --> 00:44:24,680
you know?
I mean that's most of the time.

939
00:44:24,681 --> 00:44:28,190
Most of the time,
I mean no one has in the UFC ever,

940
00:44:28,670 --> 00:44:33,670
but it's because they have the most 
rules and because they have the best 

941
00:44:34,801 --> 00:44:37,500
medical staff and the best referees and 
all that stuff,

942
00:44:37,501 --> 00:44:41,820
but it's also just luck because like 
people can die sparring.

943
00:44:41,910 --> 00:44:43,080
It happens.
What

944
00:44:43,340 --> 00:44:48,340
if you're,
if you're in a choke hold and you don't 

945
00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:48,340
tap out,

946
00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:50,110
you just go unconscious and then when 
they and then you'll be all right.

947
00:44:50,130 --> 00:44:55,130
Yeah,
you'd be fine and you can feel when 

948
00:44:55,130 --> 00:44:55,130
someone goes unconscious,
the muscles relax.

949
00:44:55,130 --> 00:44:55,800
They just slump,
slumping the referee.

950
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:57,720
Sometimes the referee like pickup and 
arm,

951
00:44:57,970 --> 00:45:01,350
the old progressing move like they would
check to see if the guy was still awake.

952
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:05,900
I didn't pick the arm and the crowd 
would go back.

953
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:07,560
Yeah,
he's about to make us come back.

954
00:45:07,850 --> 00:45:09,680
But they do do that sometimes.
Referee.

955
00:45:09,710 --> 00:45:12,390
I've seen referees pick a guy's arm up,
see if the guy responds,

956
00:45:12,450 --> 00:45:14,520
or girl,
you have two girls get choked out bunch.

957
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:15,730
Um,
but you know,

958
00:45:15,731 --> 00:45:20,731
people are tough.
They don't want to tap and then we'll 

959
00:45:20,731 --> 00:45:20,731
wind up going to sleep.
Holly Holm,

960
00:45:20,731 --> 00:45:20,731
when she fought me,
she tate,

961
00:45:20,731 --> 00:45:25,730
Misha Tate,
choked or unconscious and before holly 

962
00:45:25,730 --> 00:45:26,370
went out she was throwing punches in the
air and she went unconscious.

963
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:29,610
It's crazy.
It was crazy.

964
00:45:29,611 --> 00:45:31,040
It was,
it was prime.

965
00:45:31,041 --> 00:45:33,390
Most drownings like watching someone 
drown,

966
00:45:33,750 --> 00:45:34,870
you know.
Um,

967
00:45:35,010 --> 00:45:37,360
so it's just,
you know,

968
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:41,970
you have a preference for how you die.
Drowning drownings.

969
00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:44,580
My one of my least favorite seems like 
it would suck.

970
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:45,720
Yeah.
Yeah.

971
00:45:45,721 --> 00:45:46,980
I don't want to do that.
Yeah.

972
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:52,540
I have a buddy,
he's a big wave surfer and a like 40 

973
00:45:52,540 --> 00:45:56,261
foot waves.
Shout out to kyle and he did a breath 

974
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:59,390
holding course and he can hold his 
breath for five minutes.

975
00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:01,250
Jesus,
because he goes,

976
00:46:01,350 --> 00:46:02,810
you know,
if you get caught in one of those waves,

977
00:46:02,811 --> 00:46:05,480
you're like down in the deep for a long 
time.

978
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:09,590
Yeah.
Some really interesting.

979
00:46:09,591 --> 00:46:14,591
He was telling me some really 
interesting things like when a human 

980
00:46:14,591 --> 00:46:17,150
being puts its face in the water,
all sorts of physiological changes start

981
00:46:17,151 --> 00:46:22,151
happening.
Your metabolism immediately slows way 

982
00:46:22,151 --> 00:46:25,610
down your oxygen consumption cuts way 
back just automatically.

983
00:46:25,611 --> 00:46:30,611
We've got a lot of seemingly 
evolutionary adaptations to living in 

984
00:46:30,611 --> 00:46:31,850
the water.
Yeah.

985
00:46:31,851 --> 00:46:32,560
Have you ever heard

986
00:46:32,620 --> 00:46:36,280
that aquatic ape theory?
Does that make any sense?

987
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:41,600
Does it fit citi?
Someone should have already known that 

988
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:41,600
already.

989
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:43,090
It makes.
Here's what it does in my opinion.

990
00:46:43,470 --> 00:46:44,670
We should explain it.
Yeah.

991
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:49,060
So the idea is I first read about it in 
a book by Buckminster Fuller,

992
00:46:49,061 --> 00:46:51,120
actually.
Great.

993
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:52,300
You know about him?
Yes.

994
00:46:52,301 --> 00:46:53,800
Genius.
Uh,

995
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:58,920
the idea is that there,
according to the people who support this

996
00:46:58,991 --> 00:47:03,991
theory,
there was a period in human evolution 

997
00:47:03,991 --> 00:47:06,211
where our ancestors lived in title 
areas,

998
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:10,630
so they spend most of their time in the 
water that was about body temperature.

999
00:47:10,631 --> 00:47:15,631
So it was comfortable and it was shallow
enough that they weren't worried about 

1000
00:47:16,121 --> 00:47:21,121
sharks coming in and deep enough that 
leopards and other predators from the 

1001
00:47:21,121 --> 00:47:23,410
land couldn't get at them.
So it was safe in that respect.

1002
00:47:23,770 --> 00:47:28,770
Also,
you have a great sight lines so you can 

1003
00:47:28,770 --> 00:47:31,531
see if something's coming from a long 
way off and there's lots of there lots 

1004
00:47:31,531 --> 00:47:31,531
of mollusks

1005
00:47:31,531 --> 00:47:35,260
and fish and you can net and so it sort 
of made sense that they would be there.

1006
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:40,870
And so we have these physiological 
adaptations for aquatic living.

1007
00:47:40,871 --> 00:47:44,590
Like for example,
human infants are the only ape.

1008
00:47:44,591 --> 00:47:45,700
Certainly,
I don't know,

1009
00:47:45,730 --> 00:47:50,730
primary,
probably the only primates that know to 

1010
00:47:50,730 --> 00:47:51,790
hold their water or hold their breath 
underwater.

1011
00:47:51,810 --> 00:47:52,930
Mm.
So like that.

1012
00:47:52,931 --> 00:47:54,700
Great.
A nirvana album.

1013
00:47:54,701 --> 00:47:59,701
Cover the baby.
So you take a baby and dropped it in 

1014
00:47:59,701 --> 00:48:02,310
water and it holds its breath and 
breathe and die.

1015
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:03,250
Yeah.
Whoops.

1016
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:05,200
Yeah.
Gemstone can't even swim.

1017
00:48:05,710 --> 00:48:06,880
So,
uh,

1018
00:48:06,881 --> 00:48:11,881
there's that,
there's the fact that babies are really 

1019
00:48:11,881 --> 00:48:11,881
fat.
So they flood.

1020
00:48:11,881 --> 00:48:13,000
You can't teach chimps to swim?
No.

1021
00:48:13,090 --> 00:48:16,060
And also chimps don't have enough body 
fat to be buoyant.

1022
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:18,500
Right?
They're super core.

1023
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:23,600
Did steal their bodies.
I didn't know they could never teach 

1024
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:24,130
them to swim.
That makes sense to,

1025
00:48:24,140 --> 00:48:25,060
but they're so smart.

1026
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:26,790
I guess they just can't do it.
Huh?

1027
00:48:27,310 --> 00:48:28,840
I don't know.
But yes,

1028
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:33,900
if you see lots of contemporary zoos,
they have the chimps surrounded by a 

1029
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:36,760
moat right across the moat.
Wow.

1030
00:48:36,761 --> 00:48:38,860
What a bummer.
They'll wait in water.

1031
00:48:38,950 --> 00:48:42,720
I've seen chimps waiting,
but you know,

1032
00:48:42,721 --> 00:48:47,721
maybe then there's also the connection 
between eating fish and fish oil and 

1033
00:48:48,071 --> 00:48:49,300
brain health.
Right.

1034
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:52,940
And it was a very strong correlation 
between fish oil and brainhealth.

1035
00:48:53,090 --> 00:48:58,090
Yeah.
So it could be related to fatty acid 

1036
00:48:58,090 --> 00:49:01,020
development and also you would have to 
be clever to try to dive into the water 

1037
00:49:01,991 --> 00:49:06,040
to go after those things.
The smarter ones would probably survive,

1038
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:11,160
right?
Even the nostrils like a nostrils come 

1039
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:13,390
straight out of the face.
And the idea of our nostrils facing down

1040
00:49:13,391 --> 00:49:17,020
is related to the aquatic wow.
A explanation.

1041
00:49:17,021 --> 00:49:21,070
The oil glands that we have on our heads
and faces and shoulders that,

1042
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:24,070
you know,
cause acne and stuff and teenagers,

1043
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:29,240
uh,
that's for protection from the sun 

1044
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:29,240
apparently.

1045
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:31,990
So there are lots of adaptations that 
seem to fit into this interpretation,

1046
00:49:32,290 --> 00:49:37,290
but you know,
lots of sort of mainstream evolutionary 

1047
00:49:37,290 --> 00:49:37,990
theorists would say,
well wait a minute,

1048
00:49:37,991 --> 00:49:42,991
you know,
there are other adaptations we don't 

1049
00:49:42,991 --> 00:49:43,240
have and that we would have if that had 
been the case.

1050
00:49:43,241 --> 00:49:46,390
So it's,
it's controversial at best.

1051
00:49:46,420 --> 00:49:49,300
Part of it was also the theory that the 
human brain,

1052
00:49:49,330 --> 00:49:54,330
in order for us to be born vaginally,
the brain could only be so big before 

1053
00:49:54,330 --> 00:49:55,520
the kid was born.
Right,

1054
00:49:57,180 --> 00:49:57,740
right.
Yeah.

1055
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:01,030
I mean that's the explanation for why 
humans are born helpless.

1056
00:50:01,450 --> 00:50:06,450
No,
but what I'm saying is that we really 

1057
00:50:06,450 --> 00:50:06,450
can't.
The brain can't get any bigger,

1058
00:50:06,450 --> 00:50:07,810
right.
Vaginal canal,

1059
00:50:07,811 --> 00:50:10,930
unless our dicks get bigger and the is 
get bigger as well.

1060
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:13,720
I still hold bit about that,
about Dick Pills,

1061
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:17,050
but if they're really word Dick Pills,
no one's stopping at one.

1062
00:50:18,550 --> 00:50:20,140
Like what's the dosage?
Okay,

1063
00:50:20,290 --> 00:50:23,350
how much gives me a stroke?
I'm going to take one less than that.

1064
00:50:23,510 --> 00:50:28,510
All the fucking dice or it.
And the idea would that be every dude's 

1065
00:50:28,510 --> 00:50:28,510
Dick would just

1066
00:50:28,510 --> 00:50:30,020
become a super dick.
And every woman will be,

1067
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:30,860
you know,
she.

1068
00:50:31,370 --> 00:50:34,100
It was a joke about flying squirrel,
pussy people.

1069
00:50:34,101 --> 00:50:36,620
They would just jump dudes with big 
dicks and shopping carts.

1070
00:50:36,770 --> 00:50:38,360
We chase these girls to the edge of 
cliffs.

1071
00:50:38,361 --> 00:50:42,350
The women would leap off with their 
vaginas.

1072
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:46,040
Bonnie would have to more to have to 
change for the big Dick Pills,

1073
00:50:46,130 --> 00:50:51,130
but it doesn't.
It does seem like if pew ones are going 

1074
00:50:51,130 --> 00:50:53,761
to get smarter,
if the head is going to have to get 

1075
00:50:53,761 --> 00:50:54,800
larger,
does that make any sense or is that just

1076
00:50:54,801 --> 00:50:59,801
a crude way of looking at the brain?
Is it possible that people can get 

1077
00:50:59,801 --> 00:50:59,801
smart?
Like if we evolved,

1078
00:50:59,801 --> 00:51:01,730
have you.
If we evolved from lower hominids,

1079
00:51:01,731 --> 00:51:06,731
it's generally assumed that those lower 
hominids had little brains or brains 

1080
00:51:06,731 --> 00:51:09,170
than us right up until like Australia 
pit tickets or something like that.

1081
00:51:09,510 --> 00:51:13,640
What really seems to matter though is 
the ratio of brain size to body size,

1082
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:14,430
right?

1083
00:51:14,570 --> 00:51:19,570
There are plenty of animals that have 
bigger brains than us that aren't 

1084
00:51:19,570 --> 00:51:22,040
obviously aren't smarter than us.
Like elephant elephants,

1085
00:51:22,041 --> 00:51:23,960
blue whales,
blue whale brains.

1086
00:51:23,961 --> 00:51:28,961
Probably the size of this room.
Do we know if elephants are fucking 

1087
00:51:28,961 --> 00:51:31,571
super smart because isn't the thing 
about intelligence is not just like 

1088
00:51:31,571 --> 00:51:33,650
there's communication between elephants 
for sure,

1089
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:37,670
and we know that they recognize each 
other after long periods of time,

1090
00:51:38,090 --> 00:51:43,090
like 20 years apart,
they get together and they see each 

1091
00:51:43,090 --> 00:51:43,090
other and recognize each other 
instantly.

1092
00:51:43,090 --> 00:51:43,090
Sure.
So there's a,

1093
00:51:43,090 --> 00:51:45,200
there's an intelligence that,
but what we judge it,

1094
00:51:45,250 --> 00:51:50,250
intelligence oftentimes depends on 
whether or not it can communicate with 

1095
00:51:50,250 --> 00:51:53,750
you whether or not it changes its 
environment builds a structure.

1096
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:54,650
I mean,
that's,

1097
00:51:54,860 --> 00:51:59,860
to me,
this is one of the deepest questions in 

1098
00:51:59,860 --> 00:52:03,071
life.
Do you see the elephant that painted a 

1099
00:52:03,071 --> 00:52:03,071
picture of it?
Sure.

1100
00:52:03,071 --> 00:52:03,071
Yeah.
That's crazy.

1101
00:52:03,071 --> 00:52:03,620
Yeah.
In Thailand I think.

1102
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:04,150
Yeah.
It's pull.

1103
00:52:04,370 --> 00:52:09,370
Pull that up.
That is one of those things where you 

1104
00:52:09,370 --> 00:52:09,370
go,
okay,

1105
00:52:09,370 --> 00:52:09,370
wait a minute,
a dog can't do that.

1106
00:52:09,410 --> 00:52:14,410
I thought you said this thing was a 
smart as a dog because that's 100 times 

1107
00:52:14,410 --> 00:52:19,190
they're like grey parrots that have 300 
word vocabulary or ceiling.

1108
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:20,270
Yeah.
I mean,

1109
00:52:20,290 --> 00:52:21,740
I don't,
don't quote me on that number,

1110
00:52:21,741 --> 00:52:25,550
but Jamie can look that up there as they
can speak a whole sentence and they can.

1111
00:52:25,670 --> 00:52:28,700
And there's a guy,
I remember seeing this recently,

1112
00:52:28,701 --> 00:52:33,701
there's a guy who has a border Collie 
who obviously can't talk but understands

1113
00:52:35,060 --> 00:52:40,060
well over 100 words and so what he'll do
is he'll put all these different toys 

1114
00:52:40,060 --> 00:52:41,700
behind a wall and he'll say,
go get me the,

1115
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:46,720
the yellow bunny.
And there's like a yellow bunny or red 

1116
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:46,940
bunny in a green bunny in addition to 
the hundreds of other shit.

1117
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:49,250
And the dog will go find the yellow 
bunny and bring it back.

1118
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:50,040
Whoa.
You know,

1119
00:52:50,090 --> 00:52:51,050
go get me the,
the,

1120
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:53,300
you know,
the green turtle and you'll go get it.

1121
00:52:53,690 --> 00:52:56,510
So the dog knows those words.
Right?

1122
00:52:56,511 --> 00:52:58,820
And also the dogs.
He's in color.

1123
00:52:59,330 --> 00:53:02,480
I Guess Predator,
I guess you're seeing color think.

1124
00:53:02,630 --> 00:53:07,630
So here's the elephant painting itself.
It is fucking crazy because it really 

1125
00:53:09,801 --> 00:53:14,801
looks like itself and this guy helps it 
and gets the brush and puts it in his 

1126
00:53:15,051 --> 00:53:20,051
hand.
But the elephant is essentially doing 

1127
00:53:20,051 --> 00:53:23,261
all of this with its trunk.
And just replicating itself and it's 

1128
00:53:23,261 --> 00:53:25,120
proportional to its.
It's really good.

1129
00:53:25,370 --> 00:53:28,770
That's better than if the dude was 
holding his Tusk,

1130
00:53:29,550 --> 00:53:31,020
training them to do that.
I think.

1131
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:36,080
Well I'm sure their training or is he 
just pulling goes where they wanted to 

1132
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:37,290
see,
look at the trunk.

1133
00:53:37,620 --> 00:53:42,620
Like he's definitely holding,
but look at the trunk and look at how 

1134
00:53:42,620 --> 00:53:42,620
much motion is in that thing.

1135
00:53:42,620 --> 00:53:43,920
How could he possibly be controlling 
that?

1136
00:53:44,970 --> 00:53:47,320
He's definitely lifting it up and down 
and helping them now.

1137
00:53:48,090 --> 00:53:53,090
But what it is,
is they're working together like the 

1138
00:53:53,090 --> 00:53:54,480
elephant knows to stay in these lines.
It's doing it with him.

1139
00:53:56,340 --> 00:54:01,340
You're not buying it in a mirror or 
anything.

1140
00:54:01,790 --> 00:54:04,320
The hand on the Tusk is.
There's another one.

1141
00:54:04,410 --> 00:54:09,410
There are other ones,
but let me see the other articles that 

1142
00:54:09,410 --> 00:54:09,600
say that they're being trained to do it 
and it's cruel or something.

1143
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:10,230
Yeah.
Okay.

1144
00:54:10,231 --> 00:54:15,231
This one right here,
this thing doesn't have anybody's hands 

1145
00:54:15,231 --> 00:54:17,541
on it.
I think this is the one that I had seen 

1146
00:54:17,541 --> 00:54:17,541
before.
Let's see if there's any cases.

1147
00:54:17,610 --> 00:54:22,610
The question of intelligence is so much 
more complicated than we generally 

1148
00:54:24,510 --> 00:54:26,040
credited with,
uh,

1149
00:54:26,370 --> 00:54:29,070
not only among animals but also among 
humans.

1150
00:54:29,071 --> 00:54:32,190
There's this big controversy,
the perennial controversy.

1151
00:54:32,191 --> 00:54:37,191
That's the problem right now.
We're constantly,

1152
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:41,340
we're looking at another video and this 
is the one that I had seen his.

1153
00:54:41,580 --> 00:54:43,080
Nobody's,
nobody's touching.

1154
00:54:43,190 --> 00:54:44,820
Nobody's controlling him here.
Well,

1155
00:54:44,821 --> 00:54:48,080
he doesn't have any tusks it looks like.
Does he know?

1156
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:53,840
So that looked like the guy was just 
giving them the brush and he was doing 

1157
00:54:53,881 --> 00:54:55,120
it.
Why don't they pull back though?

1158
00:54:55,121 --> 00:54:57,200
So you could see if that's true.
See,

1159
00:54:57,201 --> 00:54:59,970
this is the one that I had seen before.
He hadn't seen the other one.

1160
00:55:00,020 --> 00:55:01,340
This one.
I would imagine that,

1161
00:55:01,530 --> 00:55:02,550
yeah,
this is an assistant.

1162
00:55:02,850 --> 00:55:07,850
I would imagine that if you did get a 
guy like this that teaches is elephant 

1163
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:13,640
how to,
how to paint a fucking picture that 

1164
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:16,490
you're going to.
It's going to become a tourist 

1165
00:55:16,490 --> 00:55:16,490
attraction.
People are going to say,

1166
00:55:16,490 --> 00:55:16,620
come and watch the elephant that paints 
the picture.

1167
00:55:16,740 --> 00:55:21,740
You as seen on Youtube.
And then next thing you know you've got 

1168
00:55:21,740 --> 00:55:21,740
a tourist business.
Well,

1169
00:55:21,740 --> 00:55:22,790
and if he always does the same picture 
to write,

1170
00:55:22,850 --> 00:55:26,280
draws himself over and over again,
but it's right here.

1171
00:55:26,340 --> 00:55:28,860
It looks to me at least like the 
elephants doing that.

1172
00:55:29,370 --> 00:55:32,070
You couldn't even talk a four year old 
and doing that.

1173
00:55:32,550 --> 00:55:36,900
So you know what I'm saying?
Like four years here at elephant,

1174
00:55:36,901 --> 00:55:38,360
you have to ask him what the fuck it is 
like,

1175
00:55:38,370 --> 00:55:40,740
what is that like?
That's an elephant.

1176
00:55:40,750 --> 00:55:41,460
You're like,
whoa.

1177
00:55:41,461 --> 00:55:46,461
That elephants crazy.
What does it do you think it knows it's 

1178
00:55:46,461 --> 00:55:46,560
drawing an elephant or it's.
That's a good question,

1179
00:55:46,590 --> 00:55:47,880
Mike.
The Toronto tree,

1180
00:55:47,950 --> 00:55:49,800
he probably doesn't know is drawing an 
elephant.

1181
00:55:50,250 --> 00:55:55,250
If I had to guess I would get out of 
guests that it probably doesn't 

1182
00:55:55,250 --> 00:55:55,830
understand the two d space like that 
because if it did,

1183
00:55:55,831 --> 00:55:59,160
it would start creating art.
They start expressing themselves to each

1184
00:55:59,161 --> 00:56:04,161
other.
They start drawing directions like go 

1185
00:56:04,161 --> 00:56:04,161
this way.
If you start seeing animals do that,

1186
00:56:04,290 --> 00:56:07,710
that is so far beyond using tools.
That's what bees do.

1187
00:56:08,390 --> 00:56:09,700
These do it with smells,
right?

1188
00:56:09,750 --> 00:56:11,160
Well,
they do it with a dance.

1189
00:56:11,190 --> 00:56:11,780
Yeah,
they.

1190
00:56:12,340 --> 00:56:15,210
They give instructions on where the 
flowers are.

1191
00:56:16,410 --> 00:56:21,410
So this question of intelligence is 
really interesting and I think very 

1192
00:56:21,410 --> 00:56:24,651
important because you know,
we talk about intelligence as if know 

1193
00:56:24,651 --> 00:56:24,651
what it is,

1194
00:56:24,651 --> 00:56:28,030
but we don't,
it expresses itself in so many itself in

1195
00:56:28,031 --> 00:56:30,460
so many different ways.
There's so many manifestation.

1196
00:56:30,700 --> 00:56:33,490
So this big controversy that's happening
now among,

1197
00:56:33,850 --> 00:56:35,350
in between,
I don't know if you're aware of this was

1198
00:56:35,351 --> 00:56:40,351
Sam Harris and I'm as recline and Andrew
Sullivan and people are trying to.

1199
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:43,120
Charles Murray,
right,

1200
00:56:43,130 --> 00:56:46,390
exactly.
That whole thing about people that don't

1201
00:56:46,391 --> 00:56:49,930
know what that Charles Murray wrote this
book called the Bell Curve,

1202
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,510
I don't know,
20 years ago or something,

1203
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:55,770
25 even where he argued that,
uh,

1204
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:59,740
there are racial differences in 
intelligence,

1205
00:57:00,100 --> 00:57:05,100
a ICU specifically with Asians being the
highest and then whites and then blacks 

1206
00:57:05,411 --> 00:57:07,510
and that,
that's just the way it is.

1207
00:57:07,511 --> 00:57:12,511
And social adjustments aren't going to 
change that because it's largely 

1208
00:57:12,511 --> 00:57:17,251
genetic.
And as I understand that was the 

1209
00:57:17,251 --> 00:57:20,851
argument.
I haven't noticed saying largely 

1210
00:57:20,851 --> 00:57:20,860
genetic,
but I think they're saying that genetics

1211
00:57:20,861 --> 00:57:23,380
play a factor and environment plays a 
factor.

1212
00:57:23,380 --> 00:57:28,380
I think some people are not willing to 
look at genetics if it shows an 

1213
00:57:28,690 --> 00:57:33,550
unfavorable trait in minorities.
They don't want to look at it.

1214
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:34,350
They,
yeah,

1215
00:57:34,450 --> 00:57:39,450
they did not true,
but I think it's also true that part of 

1216
00:57:39,611 --> 00:57:44,611
the argument is that social programs are
a waste of money because they're not 

1217
00:57:44,951 --> 00:57:48,430
going to affect it because it's genetic.
That's crazy.

1218
00:57:48,490 --> 00:57:52,630
I that I'm pretty sure that the argument
that's just straight racist to me.

1219
00:57:52,780 --> 00:57:57,780
Well,
I think that's what people are the idea 

1220
00:57:57,780 --> 00:57:57,780
like save your money to save your money.
No.

1221
00:57:57,780 --> 00:58:01,940
Do a better job.
Like you don't even know if it works 

1222
00:58:01,940 --> 00:58:01,940
because what have you done?
Like what?

1223
00:58:01,940 --> 00:58:06,810
Well go to an inner city school and 
pretend you're a 10 year old kid trying 

1224
00:58:06,810 --> 00:58:10,981
to get by in this life and you're 
literally seeing gang members and 

1225
00:58:10,981 --> 00:58:14,791
craziness and people flashing cash and 
people dropping out because they're 

1226
00:58:14,791 --> 00:58:16,720
pregnant when their 13th and you're 
trying to tell me there's not.

1227
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:19,780
There's not some sort of a massive 
environmental factor.

1228
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:22,810
If you are a white kid going to a school
like that.

1229
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:27,010
I only went to a bad school for one year
of my life.

1230
00:58:27,610 --> 00:58:29,500
I'm not,
I'm no Oji,

1231
00:58:29,860 --> 00:58:33,670
but I really did go to one bad school,
Mary curly,

1232
00:58:33,850 --> 00:58:37,900
a Middle School in Jamaica Plain and the
Jamaica Plain,

1233
00:58:37,901 --> 00:58:41,500
Massachusetts.
It's now it's become gentrified,

1234
00:58:41,501 --> 00:58:46,501
sort of.
It's kind of like East la or I'm a 

1235
00:58:46,501 --> 00:58:46,501
silver,
silver lake area,

1236
00:58:46,501 --> 00:58:48,670
you know,
a lot of hipsters have moved in and nice

1237
00:58:48,671 --> 00:58:51,400
places,
but when I lived there it was not good.

1238
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:55,060
It was very poor people in the fucking 
middle school was scary.

1239
00:58:55,480 --> 00:59:00,480
It was scary.
Seventeen year old kids and my seventh 

1240
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:00,480
grade class,
no one it'd be,

1241
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:01,000
it was just a weird play.
Maybe.

1242
00:59:01,090 --> 00:59:04,630
I guess it was eighth grade,
but the point was these kids were.

1243
00:59:04,690 --> 00:59:09,690
They were never going to graduate.
They knew it and they were trying to go 

1244
00:59:09,690 --> 00:59:09,690
back to seventh grade again or eighth 
grade,

1245
00:59:09,690 --> 00:59:14,041
whatever the fuck it was,
and the teacher would have them in the 

1246
00:59:14,041 --> 00:59:16,891
class for a couple of days and then they
would leave and everywhere you walked 

1247
00:59:16,891 --> 00:59:20,101
you were scared everywhere you walk.
Like some weird shit was happening with 

1248
00:59:20,101 --> 00:59:21,220
people.
People yelling at people.

1249
00:59:21,230 --> 00:59:22,550
There was always tension

1250
00:59:22,850 --> 00:59:25,670
and there was always like bigger kids 
around that were robbing other kids,

1251
00:59:25,671 --> 00:59:27,680
like fuck.
Like I got through that year going,

1252
00:59:27,710 --> 00:59:30,380
Holy Shit,
and when I got out of there,

1253
00:59:30,410 --> 00:59:33,440
my parents moved,
moved to a really nice part of town,

1254
00:59:33,441 --> 00:59:38,441
Newton.
But if you're a kid growing up in that 

1255
00:59:38,441 --> 00:59:41,831
environment,
good fucking luck learning anything 

1256
00:59:41,831 --> 00:59:41,831
good.
Fucking probably it's,

1257
00:59:41,831 --> 00:59:42,410
it's pretty bad at home too.
Yeah.

1258
00:59:42,411 --> 00:59:47,411
And what I experienced in Jamaica plain 
was nothing compared to Dorchester and 

1259
00:59:47,411 --> 00:59:47,630
Roxbury.
Those are the bad areas.

1260
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:50,960
They were way worse.
And we know that anxiety,

1261
00:59:50,961 --> 00:59:52,330
stress,
um,

1262
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:54,190
stops brain development.
Yes.

1263
00:59:54,290 --> 00:59:55,280
Retards.
Yes.

1264
00:59:55,460 --> 00:59:58,790
It also makes people much more inclined 
to violence when you're,

1265
00:59:58,791 --> 01:00:00,650
when you grow up in the,
even in the womb,

1266
01:00:00,890 --> 01:00:05,890
if your mother's around horrible 
situations and people screaming and 

1267
01:00:05,890 --> 01:00:07,670
fighting and that cortisol and 
adrenaline and all those,

1268
01:00:07,970 --> 01:00:09,890
all those hormones are flowing through 
that baby.

1269
01:00:09,890 --> 01:00:12,130
Pairing that baby for a violent world.
Well,

1270
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:15,050
I'm sure you know about the epigenetics 
that show that,

1271
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:19,580
that can pass several generations.
Your grandfather was in a famine.

1272
01:00:19,581 --> 01:00:22,490
You're more likely to be obese and that 
crazy.

1273
01:00:22,550 --> 01:00:23,490
It's not.
Yeah.

1274
01:00:23,660 --> 01:00:27,410
You also live longer though,
not weird like the people that were,

1275
01:00:27,411 --> 01:00:29,810
um,
that were in famine people,

1276
01:00:29,930 --> 01:00:32,180
their kids lived longer for some strange
reason.

1277
01:00:32,181 --> 01:00:33,020
Interesting.
Yeah.

1278
01:00:33,021 --> 01:00:36,830
Like your body is preparing you and be 
extra durable like we were talking about

1279
01:00:36,831 --> 01:00:41,831
before the podcast started.
And fasting is the only intervention 

1280
01:00:41,991 --> 01:00:43,880
that's ever been shown to extend 
lifespan.

1281
01:00:44,050 --> 01:00:45,050
Mm.
Nut nuts.

1282
01:00:45,130 --> 01:00:47,510
Yeah.
I do it because it makes me.

1283
01:00:47,511 --> 01:00:51,740
I'm just function better.
I do it every 16 hours.

1284
01:00:51,741 --> 01:00:53,060
I,
I eat,

1285
01:00:53,510 --> 01:00:58,510
so uh,
I'll eat and then I don't eat for 16 

1286
01:00:58,510 --> 01:00:59,420
hours so I'll eat for eight hours a day.
That's it.

1287
01:00:59,930 --> 01:01:03,590
When that's over,
that's over 9:00

1288
01:01:03,590 --> 01:01:05,060
AM to 5:00
PM or whatever it is.

1289
01:01:05,060 --> 01:01:09,230
I just figured out what the time is and 
then add 16 to it cheating.

1290
01:01:09,231 --> 01:01:12,850
I add 14 but I never had less than 14.
I see.

1291
01:01:13,030 --> 01:01:18,030
Yeah.
I was talking to a guy recently about 

1292
01:01:18,030 --> 01:01:18,200
this.
I'm Brian Fries and you're in Austin.

1293
01:01:18,201 --> 01:01:19,610
Really,
really smart guy.

1294
01:01:19,940 --> 01:01:21,410
And we were talking about this and he's 
like,

1295
01:01:21,411 --> 01:01:24,350
I only eat when the sun's up.
It's easy to keep track of.

1296
01:01:24,410 --> 01:01:29,410
That's good.
And what if you want to go to a nice 

1297
01:01:29,410 --> 01:01:29,790
dinner?
Don't eat cow,

1298
01:01:30,570 --> 01:01:32,360
go earlier.
I know you got to have cheat days.

1299
01:01:32,361 --> 01:01:33,320
When he said it,
I was like,

1300
01:01:33,321 --> 01:01:33,930
dude,
you know,

1301
01:01:33,950 --> 01:01:37,100
I spend most of my life in Spain were 
dinnertime is 10:00

1302
01:01:37,100 --> 01:01:37,370
PM.
Like,

1303
01:01:37,430 --> 01:01:40,010
that's not gonna work for me.
If I go to a restaurant,

1304
01:01:40,011 --> 01:01:41,840
I'll allow myself to have a little bit 
of bread,

1305
01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:44,000
allow myself to have dessert,
occasionally,

1306
01:01:44,030 --> 01:01:47,090
allow myself to eat some shitty things,
maybe a little pasta.

1307
01:01:47,260 --> 01:01:49,700
Feel like fuck it.
You have to be.

1308
01:01:49,701 --> 01:01:54,701
I think you have to both be disciplined.
And also I enjoy the art form of 

1309
01:01:54,701 --> 01:01:57,740
cooking.
I enjoy that people make these delicious

1310
01:01:57,741 --> 01:02:01,730
dishes.
Follow your elk and a Jalapeno instagram

1311
01:02:01,731 --> 01:02:03,710
feed there.
Joe Looks Great.

1312
01:02:03,740 --> 01:02:05,360
Do you cook at all?
I love cooking.

1313
01:02:05,361 --> 01:02:06,680
Yeah.
I have meat for you then.

1314
01:02:06,740 --> 01:02:09,890
Oh,
I have sausages Joe Rogan has made.

1315
01:02:09,891 --> 01:02:10,250
For me.

1316
01:02:12,420 --> 01:02:16,100
It was one of the early Beta thing 
again.

1317
01:02:17,930 --> 01:02:20,100
So tell you a great.
We're talking

1318
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:20,270
about

1319
01:02:20,310 --> 01:02:25,310
the van.
You know that my favorite thing in life 

1320
01:02:25,310 --> 01:02:28,680
is travel.
And the reason I love travel is that you

1321
01:02:28,681 --> 01:02:33,681
can wake up and have no idea what your 
life's going to be like by the time you 

1322
01:02:33,681 --> 01:02:33,681
go to bed.
Right,

1323
01:02:33,681 --> 01:02:38,250
right.
So we're driving the van through along 

1324
01:02:38,250 --> 01:02:42,450
the Rio Grande de and we want to go to a
big bend national park,

1325
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:44,280
which is beautiful.
It's,

1326
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:45,090
you know,
where that is.

1327
01:02:45,750 --> 01:02:49,050
It's like that part of Texas and sort of
dips down and then,

1328
01:02:49,051 --> 01:02:54,051
you know,
and there's like a big Ben don't 

1329
01:02:54,051 --> 01:02:54,051
literally a big Ben that's the river.
Um,

1330
01:02:54,051 --> 01:02:56,640
so it's way down South Texas.
That's a weird spot.

1331
01:02:56,970 --> 01:02:57,820
It's cool.
It's,

1332
01:02:57,840 --> 01:03:00,210
it's,
it's interesting in south Texas.

1333
01:03:00,230 --> 01:03:01,290
Strange.
Yeah.

1334
01:03:01,370 --> 01:03:03,140
Yeah.
She'd have a passport to go there.

1335
01:03:04,620 --> 01:03:07,060
I in the rivers like as wide as this 
room.

1336
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:07,810
I mean,
it's nothing,

1337
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:12,840
you know,
you could just walk across over to 

1338
01:03:12,840 --> 01:03:12,840
Mexico.
Wow.

1339
01:03:12,840 --> 01:03:12,840
Um,
but anyway,

1340
01:03:12,840 --> 01:03:13,510
so,
so we get into,

1341
01:03:13,511 --> 01:03:18,511
uh,
the western entrance of big band and 

1342
01:03:18,511 --> 01:03:18,940
it's like 4:00
PM and the guy says,

1343
01:03:18,941 --> 01:03:20,440
yeah,
all the campgrounds are full.

1344
01:03:20,441 --> 01:03:21,430
And it was like,
ah,

1345
01:03:21,460 --> 01:03:22,060
Shit.
Okay,

1346
01:03:22,100 --> 01:03:23,900
can I get a back country permanently?
No,

1347
01:03:23,910 --> 01:03:24,990
you can't,
you gotta.

1348
01:03:25,330 --> 01:03:26,770
Okay.
So he says,

1349
01:03:26,980 --> 01:03:28,960
just go back to a little town right 
there,

1350
01:03:29,020 --> 01:03:31,510
spend the night there and then come in 
the morning and I'll hook you up.

1351
01:03:31,780 --> 01:03:32,380
Okay,
great.

1352
01:03:32,830 --> 01:03:35,560
So we'll go back to this town.
It's called Terlingua little town.

1353
01:03:35,561 --> 01:03:38,200
We just drove through it on the way in,
nothing there,

1354
01:03:38,500 --> 01:03:39,580
you know,
some houses,

1355
01:03:39,581 --> 01:03:41,350
whatever.
And um,

1356
01:03:42,580 --> 01:03:44,710
and we find this restaurant and it's 
like,

1357
01:03:44,711 --> 01:03:49,711
okay,
we're just going to crash behind a 

1358
01:03:49,711 --> 01:03:49,711
dumpster in the van and,
you know,

1359
01:03:49,711 --> 01:03:49,990
whatever.
And uh,

1360
01:03:50,290 --> 01:03:55,290
spend the night there.
So we're sitting there and I remembered 

1361
01:03:55,290 --> 01:03:57,580
somebody had sent me an instagram direct
message like about Terlingua.

1362
01:03:58,030 --> 01:04:00,880
So I'd go back and I find it and the 
guy's like,

1363
01:04:00,881 --> 01:04:02,050
hey,
if you get to Terlingua,

1364
01:04:02,051 --> 01:04:04,060
Texas,
you should look up my buddy tony.

1365
01:04:04,190 --> 01:04:06,230
He's really cool.
So here's his,

1366
01:04:06,290 --> 01:04:11,290
his handle site.
You can't tell people that you're 

1367
01:04:11,290 --> 01:04:12,020
willing to do this because now they're 
going to be sending you direct messages.

1368
01:04:12,140 --> 01:04:15,450
Oh,
they do it all the time and see bits.

1369
01:04:15,890 --> 01:04:20,890
You're paranoid it was going to be a 
dude with a ball gag in his hand and 

1370
01:04:20,890 --> 01:04:24,431
you've got to go what?
And then you get to feel that wet cloth 

1371
01:04:24,431 --> 01:04:24,431
filled with chloroform.
See,

1372
01:04:24,890 --> 01:04:26,300
you're in a different world.
Joe.

1373
01:04:26,301 --> 01:04:29,600
I'm,
I'm in a world of micro podcasting where

1374
01:04:29,601 --> 01:04:32,630
everybody who reaches out to me,
he likes me,

1375
01:04:32,930 --> 01:04:34,470
he reaches out to you,
I'm sure,

1376
01:04:34,620 --> 01:04:39,620
and they're not crazy.
They're just want to tie you up a 

1377
01:04:39,620 --> 01:04:39,620
little.
Hey,

1378
01:04:39,620 --> 01:04:41,840
what's wrong with that?
I remember showing you what time,

1379
01:04:41,930 --> 01:04:46,930
long time ago I was here doing a podcast
in my phone and a message came in and I 

1380
01:04:46,930 --> 01:04:51,401
looked and it was this really hot woman 
in Australia who liked to send me naked 

1381
01:04:51,401 --> 01:04:53,060
pictures of herself and I showed it to 
you and you're like,

1382
01:04:53,330 --> 01:04:55,580
that's a trap.
It's a trap trap.

1383
01:04:56,120 --> 01:04:57,110
Trap,
trap.

1384
01:04:57,111 --> 01:04:57,980
Looks like right there.

1385
01:05:00,150 --> 01:05:03,770
They are different over there.
They're there.

1386
01:05:04,030 --> 01:05:08,330
They're far away.
They are interesting people.

1387
01:05:08,810 --> 01:05:10,280
Anyway,
that's a place I would live.

1388
01:05:10,310 --> 01:05:11,990
I like Australia.
It would live there.

1389
01:05:13,100 --> 01:05:14,600
Trillion people.
They're funny,

1390
01:05:14,601 --> 01:05:19,601
as funny as fuck,
but they get American comedy straight 

1391
01:05:19,601 --> 01:05:19,601
away.
Like there's no.

1392
01:05:19,601 --> 01:05:21,040
There's no problem with doing shows over
that.

1393
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:24,040
Humor is an interesting thing.
Cultural Humor.

1394
01:05:24,160 --> 01:05:25,270
Anyway,
let me finish this story.

1395
01:05:25,271 --> 01:05:26,920
So I texted this dude,
I'm like,

1396
01:05:26,921 --> 01:05:27,880
Hey,
I'm interlink way,

1397
01:05:27,881 --> 01:05:29,440
you don't know me,
but some friend of yours,

1398
01:05:29,441 --> 01:05:34,441
whatever.
He texts us back if you were in this 

1399
01:05:34,441 --> 01:05:34,441
restaurant,
come have a beer.

1400
01:05:34,441 --> 01:05:35,530
So we go to this restaurant,
there's this table,

1401
01:05:35,531 --> 01:05:37,600
maybe a dozen people center the table,
Hey,

1402
01:05:37,601 --> 01:05:38,990
come buy a,
have a beer.

1403
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:42,040
A really nice people.
Uh,

1404
01:05:42,070 --> 01:05:43,990
after about 15 minutes I say to 
somebody,

1405
01:05:44,470 --> 01:05:45,700
are you guys tripping?
He's like,

1406
01:05:45,701 --> 01:05:46,100
yeah,
we,

1407
01:05:46,110 --> 01:05:47,170
yeah,
we ate some mushrooms.

1408
01:05:48,670 --> 01:05:50,680
Some of them did,
some of them did anyway,

1409
01:05:50,681 --> 01:05:55,150
but super relaxed and uh,
somebody makes some joke about like,

1410
01:05:55,151 --> 01:06:00,151
their,
their beer glass was dirty or something 

1411
01:06:00,151 --> 01:06:00,190
and someone else's like,
yeah,

1412
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:02,860
just lick it.
It's good for your microbiome.

1413
01:06:03,780 --> 01:06:04,240
And I'm like,
Oh,

1414
01:06:04,241 --> 01:06:05,630
you guys know about microbiome?
Like,

1415
01:06:05,640 --> 01:06:06,040
yeah,
yeah.

1416
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:11,400
I said,
I read this article a couple of years 

1417
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:11,400
ago.
This dude,

1418
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:14,311
you probably read this article yourself.
This dude was in Africa with the Hadza 

1419
01:06:14,590 --> 01:06:16,000
people,
the hunter gatherers,

1420
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:21,240
and he took some Hadza shit and he mixed
it up and blasted it up his ass to see 

1421
01:06:21,240 --> 01:06:25,201
if he could get a hunter gatherer is 
microbiome because it's a much more 

1422
01:06:25,201 --> 01:06:26,620
complex microbiome.
Right.

1423
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:31,120
I say this to this dude thinking he's 
gonna have a reaction like you just had,

1424
01:06:31,690 --> 01:06:33,610
and he says,
oh yeah,

1425
01:06:33,611 --> 01:06:36,460
that's him.
He points to the end of the table.

1426
01:06:36,610 --> 01:06:38,280
I said,
what have you guys have?

1427
01:06:39,050 --> 01:06:41,260
No Air's coming.
The guys look at me,

1428
01:06:41,261 --> 01:06:43,960
smile and I said that you,
that's you.

1429
01:06:43,961 --> 01:06:44,590
He's like,
yeah.

1430
01:06:44,650 --> 01:06:47,690
He asked me.
You blasted fucking 100 gala.

1431
01:06:47,691 --> 01:06:48,370
Yeah,
yeah.

1432
01:06:48,371 --> 01:06:52,240
I do this thing in Africa.
This guy is a world famous scientists,

1433
01:06:52,241 --> 01:06:56,710
microbiome expert,
spends half his life in Africa with this

1434
01:06:56,740 --> 01:07:01,740
hunter gatherer group and the other half
in this tiny little town in Texas and 

1435
01:07:01,740 --> 01:07:05,350
there he is,
and so we stayed there for days.

1436
01:07:05,351 --> 01:07:07,990
Became great friends with this guy.
I did a podcast with him.

1437
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:10,300
Fantastic.
Jeff Leach.

1438
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:14,260
I'm going to tangentially speaking the 
podcast available on Itunes,

1439
01:07:14,261 --> 01:07:15,820
stitcher,
and everywhere else available.

1440
01:07:15,821 --> 01:07:17,620
We're fine.
Podcasts are found.

1441
01:07:18,310 --> 01:07:19,870
Wow,
I'm going to listen to that one.

1442
01:07:19,871 --> 01:07:23,650
That sounds amazing.
What a coincidence was the trip and that

1443
01:07:23,651 --> 01:07:27,580
was totally fell out of the sky.
We went to visit Peter Gorman,

1444
01:07:27,581 --> 01:07:32,581
you know him.
He was editor of High Times magazine in 

1445
01:07:32,581 --> 01:07:32,581
the seventies.

1446
01:07:32,581 --> 01:07:35,710
First person to write about Iowasca in 
the western press.

1447
01:07:36,010 --> 01:07:38,320
Not Scientifically,
but popular press.

1448
01:07:38,470 --> 01:07:41,140
Oh Wow.
Explore the Amazon for years.

1449
01:07:41,141 --> 01:07:44,410
Was all over down there.
First person to write about Sapo,

1450
01:07:44,500 --> 01:07:45,940
you know the,
the burn.

1451
01:07:46,220 --> 01:07:46,920
Yeah.
Yeah.

1452
01:07:47,230 --> 01:07:49,240
Really interesting dude.
He's in Texas too.

1453
01:07:49,450 --> 01:07:51,160
Wow.
We drove up to see him.

1454
01:07:51,161 --> 01:07:53,680
So it's Kinda like just cruising around 
in the van,

1455
01:07:53,710 --> 01:07:58,710
like hanging out with cool people.
I heard that frog poison stuff is 

1456
01:07:58,710 --> 01:08:00,610
horrible that the trip.
Yeah,

1457
01:08:00,820 --> 01:08:05,820
I mean I guess it was Aubrey wasn't an 
artery that was on the podcast talking 

1458
01:08:05,820 --> 01:08:07,960
about doing the tree frog poison.
Pretty sure it was him.

1459
01:08:07,961 --> 01:08:11,200
He's done everything.
He's like Mikey from that commercial,

1460
01:08:11,350 --> 01:08:15,560
but for life he hates everything.
He's in there.

1461
01:08:15,561 --> 01:08:16,100
That's all

1462
01:08:16,250 --> 01:08:17,900
he loves.
Everything takes everything.

1463
01:08:18,320 --> 01:08:19,280
But he,
um,

1464
01:08:19,400 --> 01:08:21,290
he was saying it was just a terrible 
ordeal,

1465
01:08:21,350 --> 01:08:22,100
but there was,
um,

1466
01:08:22,430 --> 01:08:27,430
there was also an article that I read 
about certain countries where they 

1467
01:08:27,430 --> 01:08:32,110
didn't have an endogenous psychedelic or
didn't have a local psychedelic,

1468
01:08:32,390 --> 01:08:34,820
so these people would take ordeal 
poisons,

1469
01:08:35,270 --> 01:08:40,270
so they would take poisons that would 
get them like literally to the brink of 

1470
01:08:40,270 --> 01:08:44,591
death and then they would come out of it
like a near death experience and that 

1471
01:08:44,591 --> 01:08:47,780
this near death experience provided some
sort of a shamanistic,

1472
01:08:48,070 --> 01:08:49,190
you know,
um,

1473
01:08:49,240 --> 01:08:54,240
uh,
some sort of a breakthrough experience 

1474
01:08:54,240 --> 01:08:54,240
where you could move on to the next 
level.

1475
01:08:54,240 --> 01:08:55,720
Like you had experienced something that 
was like,

1476
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:57,470
like we were talking about before the 
podcast,

1477
01:08:57,471 --> 01:09:00,410
like when you lived in Portland and then
coming here in la when it's sunny out,

1478
01:09:00,411 --> 01:09:01,610
you're like,
ah,

1479
01:09:01,970 --> 01:09:04,820
Simon,
you just feel it like that.

1480
01:09:04,820 --> 01:09:09,820
It's similar,
a similar theory about a Africa that 

1481
01:09:09,820 --> 01:09:11,780
there aren't a lot of endogenous 
psychedelic plants.

1482
01:09:11,781 --> 01:09:16,781
They're Boga is one of the only ones and
that's incredibly strong and not 

1483
01:09:16,781 --> 01:09:21,131
available all over the continent.
And so they develop complex rhythms to 

1484
01:09:21,131 --> 01:09:22,640
provoke a altered state.
Hmm.

1485
01:09:22,760 --> 01:09:27,760
That makes sense and that's why African 
rhythms are so complex and native 

1486
01:09:27,760 --> 01:09:30,110
American rhythms are very simple.
That's because they were hot as fuck,

1487
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:31,610
fuck already.
And just boom,

1488
01:09:31,611 --> 01:09:32,120
boom,
boom.

1489
01:09:32,121 --> 01:09:33,710
As you know.
Have you heard,

1490
01:09:34,100 --> 01:09:37,520
have you ever heard any of the Eco rose 
that ob replays when he has his little?

1491
01:09:38,100 --> 01:09:41,790
No,
they.

1492
01:09:42,260 --> 01:09:47,260
He's got these arrows that he got from 
these South American Shamans and I 

1493
01:09:47,270 --> 01:09:52,270
listened to him sometimes when I write 
because I like listening to things that 

1494
01:09:52,270 --> 01:09:54,690
I don't know the language when I write 
like I like a guy,

1495
01:09:54,740 --> 01:09:59,210
like some music from Armenia,
some Lebanese music I like.

1496
01:09:59,310 --> 01:10:04,310
It's cool listening to things where I 
have no idea what they're saying so I 

1497
01:10:04,310 --> 01:10:06,530
don't get wrapped up in what I feel 
their emotions,

1498
01:10:06,531 --> 01:10:11,531
but I don't get wrapped up in whatever 
they're talking about so I can write 

1499
01:10:11,531 --> 01:10:14,370
about whatever fucking table tops.
So a lot of good music out there.

1500
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:16,580
And Brazilian.
The African?

1501
01:10:16,581 --> 01:10:17,550
Yeah.
I.

1502
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:22,600
Most of the music I listened to,
I don't understand the words because I 

1503
01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:24,830
really fixate on the words if I do.
The ECO rows are crazy because they,

1504
01:10:24,890 --> 01:10:28,460
they make the psychedelic trip dance to 
them,

1505
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:33,560
like dmt dmt with the negroes.
You realize like the [inaudible].

1506
01:10:33,680 --> 01:10:38,680
It's like a technology that was invented
to work with DMT,

1507
01:10:39,830 --> 01:10:41,390
right?
Like this is like,

1508
01:10:41,391 --> 01:10:44,330
give me some volume on this shit.
This is what they sound like

1509
01:10:50,990 --> 01:10:54,920
now by itself.
You listen to this right now and you go,

1510
01:10:54,921 --> 01:10:57,620
oh,
this is just like some weird slow music,

1511
01:10:58,820 --> 01:11:03,820
but when you're in the dimension of 
dimethyltryptamine and the world has 

1512
01:11:04,551 --> 01:11:08,810
become infinite fractals that are moving
and changing and morphing.

1513
01:11:08,990 --> 01:11:13,990
When you hear this song,
the hallucinations or whatever they are 

1514
01:11:13,990 --> 01:11:15,630
that you're experiencing the 
visualizations,

1515
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:18,930
they danced to the song 100 percent in 
sync,

1516
01:11:19,770 --> 01:11:23,130
so all this.
It's comforting.

1517
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:28,280
Yeah.
That's another thing that keeps people 

1518
01:11:28,280 --> 01:11:30,651
from having bad trips sometimes because 
they can cling to the music and the 

1519
01:11:30,651 --> 01:11:34,221
structure in the music.
Whereas their own paranoia and fear and 

1520
01:11:34,221 --> 01:11:38,540
inability to let go gets hit with that 
psychedelic Jews and just experienced 

1521
01:11:39,841 --> 01:11:44,841
that new and some people freak out,
but this music might be able to bring 

1522
01:11:44,841 --> 01:11:48,411
them down.
It sounds like what a fetus might hear 

1523
01:11:48,411 --> 01:11:48,411
in the womb

1524
01:11:48,411 --> 01:11:50,000
got that heartbeat to.
Yeah,

1525
01:11:50,040 --> 01:11:52,450
right.
Imagine what fetus here.

1526
01:11:57,970 --> 01:12:02,970
See,
I like listening to this kind of shit 

1527
01:12:02,970 --> 01:12:04,531
when I write because I don't have no 
idea what they're saying and so I can 

1528
01:12:04,531 --> 01:12:06,970
just keep it on the background and also 
makes me feel like just knowing,

1529
01:12:07,900 --> 01:12:11,440
just knowing that that's out there,
knowing that the DMT world is out there,

1530
01:12:11,441 --> 01:12:16,441
it makes me just a little bit nervous.
It makes you write better when you're 

1531
01:12:16,441 --> 01:12:16,441
writing jokes or others,
everything,

1532
01:12:16,441 --> 01:12:21,091
whatever.
Either you ever written a book or essay 

1533
01:12:21,091 --> 01:12:24,181
or stuff.
I've written essays to write a lot in 

1534
01:12:24,181 --> 01:12:24,181
some of your essays.
One,

1535
01:12:24,181 --> 01:12:24,720
are we talking about it?
Yeah.

1536
01:12:24,970 --> 01:12:29,970
You run a beautiful one couple of years 
ago about that that I really,

1537
01:12:30,311 --> 01:12:33,100
I don't know if I've ever told you how 
much I appreciated that actually.

1538
01:12:33,370 --> 01:12:34,920
It was about,
um,

1539
01:12:35,230 --> 01:12:40,230
how the quest for optimal fitness 
shouldn't be taken as in mortality.

1540
01:12:44,830 --> 01:12:46,210
That we're all going to die.

1541
01:12:46,210 --> 01:12:47,860
And do you got to sort of deal with 
that?

1542
01:12:47,861 --> 01:12:52,861
Do you remember what I'm talking about?
I think I wrote your body's a 

1543
01:12:52,861 --> 01:12:52,960
sandcastle.
That's what it is.

1544
01:12:53,300 --> 01:12:58,300
Sand castles are beautiful,
but one of the beautiful things about 

1545
01:12:58,300 --> 01:13:01,051
this,
we know how temporary they are when you 

1546
01:13:01,051 --> 01:13:01,051
see a sand castle,
it's not just like,

1547
01:13:01,051 --> 01:13:01,051
oh,
this guy made an amazing sculpture,

1548
01:13:01,340 --> 01:13:01,860
so I go,
no,

1549
01:13:01,870 --> 01:13:04,600
this person made something that they 
know is not going to last,

1550
01:13:04,930 --> 01:13:06,610
and they put a massive amount of work 
into it,

1551
01:13:06,611 --> 01:13:08,940
but part of the beauty of it is that a 
soft collar?

1552
01:13:09,430 --> 01:13:10,090
Yeah.
I really,

1553
01:13:10,100 --> 01:13:12,280
I enjoy that.
I think that was for a magazine.

1554
01:13:12,680 --> 01:13:14,170
Yeah.
I forget what magazine.

1555
01:13:14,171 --> 01:13:19,171
So you have a book in mind.
I started writing a book and then I had 

1556
01:13:19,691 --> 01:13:22,360
to deal with the publishing company,
like wanting.

1557
01:13:22,540 --> 01:13:25,270
They wanted very specific kinds of 
writing.

1558
01:13:26,130 --> 01:13:26,460
Oh,
that's.

1559
01:13:26,461 --> 01:13:27,400
Yeah.
It's for maximum.

1560
01:13:27,490 --> 01:13:28,710
That's what it was.
Um,

1561
01:13:28,930 --> 01:13:31,930
they wanted very specific,
like they want a jokey jokes.

1562
01:13:31,960 --> 01:13:36,960
They,
they even offered to just pay me to 

1563
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:36,960
transcribe my act.
And I was like,

1564
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:38,020
I don't want to do that.
And they go,

1565
01:13:38,021 --> 01:13:40,900
but these people did it.
Some famous comedians did it.

1566
01:13:40,940 --> 01:13:41,980
I said,
that's fine.

1567
01:13:42,040 --> 01:13:44,170
I just not what I want to do.
I like writing,

1568
01:13:44,470 --> 01:13:47,530
but I like writing shit that I feel like
writing,

1569
01:13:47,560 --> 01:13:49,150
like I don't,
I don't want to have some.

1570
01:13:49,151 --> 01:13:52,690
So when we went into it they like,
we love your blogs,

1571
01:13:52,691 --> 01:13:54,400
we think you're really funny.
Uh,

1572
01:13:54,770 --> 01:13:57,580
this will be good for you had the 
podcast.

1573
01:13:57,820 --> 01:13:58,870
Yes.
Yeah,

1574
01:13:58,900 --> 01:14:00,620
so I gave him all their money back.
I just,

1575
01:14:00,630 --> 01:14:01,690
I don't want to do this.
Yeah,

1576
01:14:01,730 --> 01:14:05,550
just at this point on free,
free range to do whatever you want it.

1577
01:14:06,220 --> 01:14:11,220
I just think that anytime you willingly 
take on some new project

1578
01:14:12,460 --> 01:14:15,170
managers and others,
they might like their,

1579
01:14:15,580 --> 01:14:19,090
their opinion might very well be valid,
but I'm not looking for it.

1580
01:14:19,480 --> 01:14:24,070
I want whatever I write to be out of my 
head and whether it's good or bad,

1581
01:14:24,130 --> 01:14:26,890
dependent upon how much focus and 
attention I put into it,

1582
01:14:27,670 --> 01:14:28,040
you know,
I,

1583
01:14:28,041 --> 01:14:30,700
I'm pretty self critical so if I think 
it's Clunky,

1584
01:14:30,701 --> 01:14:35,701
I'll try to Redo it,
but I'm not interested in like 

1585
01:14:35,701 --> 01:14:38,020
artistically or creatively going down a 
direction where somebody else is picking

1586
01:14:38,021 --> 01:14:41,270
the subject matter or somebody else's 
suggesting like,

1587
01:14:41,350 --> 01:14:41,710
I'm not.

1588
01:14:42,520 --> 01:14:44,770
That's fine.
There's no reason for you to do that.

1589
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:47,590
I mean,
you've got the massive platform and well

1590
01:14:47,591 --> 01:14:48,940
established voice.
You don't.

1591
01:14:49,560 --> 01:14:54,560
I think honestly,
I think publishing is at the napster 

1592
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:55,530
stage right now.
I think it's.

1593
01:14:55,531 --> 01:14:57,460
It's sort of collapsing.
I'm at,

1594
01:14:57,580 --> 01:15:02,580
I'm finishing this book I've been 
working on for a few years now and I 

1595
01:15:02,580 --> 01:15:05,770
don't know that I'll ever published 
another book with major publishers will.

1596
01:15:05,771 --> 01:15:06,820
You've had great success with

1597
01:15:06,930 --> 01:15:11,930
podcast as well,
but the beautiful thing about your 

1598
01:15:11,930 --> 01:15:12,210
podcast is it allows you to put out an 
idea almost instantaneously.

1599
01:15:12,211 --> 01:15:14,340
I mean you get together with this 
rattlesnake guy,

1600
01:15:14,430 --> 01:15:15,990
you guys have a couple of our 
conversation.

1601
01:15:15,991 --> 01:15:17,460
You upload that shit and that's it.

1602
01:15:17,700 --> 01:15:22,700
It's wonderful and it brings these 
really interesting people into my life 

1603
01:15:22,700 --> 01:15:26,121
and my circle of friends now is largely 
composed of either guests or listeners 

1604
01:15:27,181 --> 01:15:28,370
of the podcast.
You know,

1605
01:15:28,380 --> 01:15:29,120
it's.
Yeah,

1606
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:34,280
it's wonderful.
I just put out a book recently that's a 

1607
01:15:34,830 --> 01:15:39,830
sort of compilations of podcasts,
so it's not the whole conversation 

1608
01:15:40,531 --> 01:15:45,531
obviously,
but it's excerpts and the whole thing 

1609
01:15:45,531 --> 01:15:46,440
was crowd sourced.
So people who listen to the podcast pick

1610
01:15:46,441 --> 01:15:51,441
the episodes they picked,
what part of the episodes that they 

1611
01:15:51,441 --> 01:15:52,560
thought was most interesting.
They transcribed it.

1612
01:15:52,920 --> 01:15:57,920
This Guy Adam mcdade did all the art,
the publisher misfit press or people 

1613
01:15:57,920 --> 01:16:02,901
that I know through the podcasts.
They reached out to me and we had some 

1614
01:16:02,901 --> 01:16:04,770
beers and it was not intending to do 
anything together.

1615
01:16:04,771 --> 01:16:05,550
Just like,
hey dude,

1616
01:16:05,551 --> 01:16:09,450
we're in town and we'd like your show.
Can we get a beer and really liked these

1617
01:16:09,451 --> 01:16:14,451
guys and ended up having the CEO on the 
podcast aj and um,

1618
01:16:15,960 --> 01:16:16,140
yeah.

1619
01:16:16,140 --> 01:16:21,140
So we just put out the book and it's,
it sort of fulfills my fantasy of being 

1620
01:16:21,331 --> 01:16:24,050
a writer without having to write,
you know,

1621
01:16:24,300 --> 01:16:25,660
if I could,
I do what you're in it,

1622
01:16:25,661 --> 01:16:30,661
you,
you remember you signed a release for 

1623
01:16:30,661 --> 01:16:30,661
her.
I remember remember that Joe,

1624
01:16:31,680 --> 01:16:34,420
you and Duncan and Duncan and my mother 
blurbed it.

1625
01:16:34,440 --> 01:16:35,500
It's.
Oh,

1626
01:16:35,570 --> 01:16:36,980
that's awesome.
Yeah.

1627
01:16:37,170 --> 01:16:39,150
Yeah.
You don't even know you blurbed it.

1628
01:16:39,410 --> 01:16:43,290
We just lifted something you said on a,
on a podcast about you.

1629
01:16:43,790 --> 01:16:45,150
He said,
perfect.

1630
01:16:45,210 --> 01:16:46,050
Was.
He said,

1631
01:16:46,380 --> 01:16:47,940
whatever it is,
I sign off on it now.

1632
01:16:48,520 --> 01:16:53,520
You said Chris is the,
is the best Beta cook I've ever met and 

1633
01:16:55,591 --> 01:16:57,740
uh,
anyway,

1634
01:16:58,260 --> 01:16:58,970
so yeah,
that,

1635
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,140
that's my dream is to put out one of 
these a year.

1636
01:17:01,170 --> 01:17:06,170
That's a great idea.
And I mean really there's a lot of 

1637
01:17:06,170 --> 01:17:07,140
amazing conversations that I've had with
people on this podcast that I would love

1638
01:17:07,141 --> 01:17:12,141
to see written down or I could read it,
go over it and let's not here my own 

1639
01:17:12,141 --> 01:17:12,141
fun.

1640
01:17:12,141 --> 01:17:13,970
And also it's,
you people have in the bathroom,

1641
01:17:14,030 --> 01:17:15,230
you know,
it's like a little thing.

1642
01:17:15,231 --> 01:17:16,580
You just pick it up.
Whatever it is,

1643
01:17:16,581 --> 01:17:19,280
there's no,
you don't need to follow the flow or the

1644
01:17:19,390 --> 01:17:20,480
end.
You're encouraging reading,

1645
01:17:20,481 --> 01:17:25,481
which is a dying thing and people and in
there are a lot of people out there who 

1646
01:17:25,481 --> 01:17:25,481
don't listen to podcasts.
Right.

1647
01:17:25,481 --> 01:17:27,710
Me included.
I rarely listen to podcasts.

1648
01:17:27,770 --> 01:17:29,240
Do you listen to books on tape?
No,

1649
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:29,910
no,
no.

1650
01:17:30,010 --> 01:17:33,230
We'll see.
I don't have spaces in my life where I'm

1651
01:17:33,231 --> 01:17:38,231
doing something that would allow me to 
listen to voices talking that wouldn't 

1652
01:17:39,291 --> 01:17:41,500
interfere with what I'm doing.
So like,

1653
01:17:41,660 --> 01:17:43,160
yeah,
I'm not a carpenter.

1654
01:17:43,161 --> 01:17:45,850
I'm not driving long distances,
you know,

1655
01:17:45,890 --> 01:17:50,890
it's like I'm either writing or I'm 
doing the doing my podcast or something 

1656
01:17:52,611 --> 01:17:54,200
else,
but there's not,

1657
01:17:54,201 --> 01:17:56,090
I don't commute,
you know what I mean?

1658
01:17:56,470 --> 01:18:01,040
So,
so there's a specific sort of activities

1659
01:18:01,041 --> 01:18:06,041
that lend lend themselves to listening 
to podcasts and a lot of people just 

1660
01:18:06,041 --> 01:18:09,851
don't have those spaces in their lives.
So I envisioned the book is like 

1661
01:18:09,851 --> 01:18:11,180
something where people can be like,
hey dude,

1662
01:18:11,181 --> 01:18:14,090
I know you don't listen to podcasts,
but this is why I do.

1663
01:18:14,690 --> 01:18:19,690
These are the sorts of crazy ass 
conversations that Chris and Duncan and 

1664
01:18:19,690 --> 01:18:21,170
Joe get into.
And that's why I like listening to those

1665
01:18:21,171 --> 01:18:21,970
guys,
you know,

1666
01:18:22,250 --> 01:18:25,880
or Wim Hoff or Graham Hancock and all 
these guys are in the book.

1667
01:18:26,030 --> 01:18:26,660
Oh,
awesome.

1668
01:18:26,720 --> 01:18:27,950
Yeah,
yeah.

1669
01:18:27,951 --> 01:18:28,190
Man

1670
01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:33,480
Stopped.
I thought about it because before I 

1671
01:18:33,480 --> 01:18:36,181
started doing the podcast,
I would listen to recordings of like 

1672
01:18:36,181 --> 01:18:39,870
lectures at Terence Mckenna would give 
or a timothy leary or you know,

1673
01:18:40,690 --> 01:18:42,460
and there wasn't a lot,
you know,

1674
01:18:42,461 --> 01:18:45,940
you or listen to art bell having some 
weird,

1675
01:18:46,090 --> 01:18:48,580
a ufo expert on or something like that.
I mean,

1676
01:18:48,581 --> 01:18:51,670
that's really what you had to listen to.
You didn't have very many choices.

1677
01:18:52,030 --> 01:18:57,030
And then I think about all the 
conversations that I've been able to 

1678
01:18:57,030 --> 01:18:59,521
have with guys like John Anthony West 
with Graham Hancock and Randall Carlson 

1679
01:18:59,521 --> 01:19:03,451
and Michael Shermer and you and Duncan 
and I mean so many people had these 

1680
01:19:04,151 --> 01:19:06,460
crazy conversations with them.
That to me,

1681
01:19:06,461 --> 01:19:08,200
they've been.
I mean,

1682
01:19:08,201 --> 01:19:13,201
I,
it's shaped the way I look at 

1683
01:19:13,201 --> 01:19:15,691
everything.
It's changed everything and so I feel 

1684
01:19:15,691 --> 01:19:15,770
like I'm constantly getting educated,
you know?

1685
01:19:15,910 --> 01:19:18,530
Yeah.
You set up your life as like,

1686
01:19:19,810 --> 01:19:21,460
not,
I'm not talking about myself,

1687
01:19:21,461 --> 01:19:26,461
but you've had guests who are some of 
the smartest people in the world who 

1688
01:19:26,461 --> 01:19:29,410
come to you to sit here and chat with 
you for,

1689
01:19:29,411 --> 01:19:30,040
you know,
I mean,

1690
01:19:30,041 --> 01:19:35,041
that's.
You have set up an amazing little 

1691
01:19:35,041 --> 01:19:35,041
educational institution

1692
01:19:35,041 --> 01:19:37,050
here at times.
Sometimes it's education,

1693
01:19:37,910 --> 01:19:40,010
sometimes it's chaos,
but it's slow.

1694
01:19:40,011 --> 01:19:45,011
That's education certainly is.
You learned about what we're like when 

1695
01:19:45,011 --> 01:19:48,881
we're drunk,
but it's what it is is it's a fan.

1696
01:19:49,150 --> 01:19:54,150
You know what I mean?
It's a thing and it's a thing that's 

1697
01:19:54,150 --> 01:19:54,150
enjoyable to me.
Like A.

1698
01:19:54,150 --> 01:19:58,010
It's like I like having all these 
conversations so if I can record them 

1699
01:19:58,010 --> 01:19:58,280
and they just put them out there and 
other people like them.

1700
01:19:58,650 --> 01:20:01,130
It's.
This is a very rare,

1701
01:20:01,190 --> 01:20:06,190
a balanced sort of relationship.
So to me there's no other way I'd get 

1702
01:20:06,190 --> 01:20:07,190
like if I said to you,
Hey Chris,

1703
01:20:07,410 --> 01:20:07,980
let's sit

1704
01:20:07,980 --> 01:20:10,440
down and talk for three hours.
You'd be like,

1705
01:20:10,441 --> 01:20:12,180
I'm okay.
All right,

1706
01:20:12,181 --> 01:20:17,181
I'll block off three hours for you.
Can I look at my phone at all during 

1707
01:20:17,181 --> 01:20:17,181
this time?
Can I get up to go to the bathroom?

1708
01:20:17,370 --> 01:20:20,910
We would never have this.
Like as connected a conversation,

1709
01:20:21,540 --> 01:20:26,540
I just got another set of headphones to 
give to my guests because the 

1710
01:20:27,420 --> 01:20:32,420
extensively.
The main reason is I'm using handheld 

1711
01:20:32,420 --> 01:20:35,181
now because my whole thing is mobile 
right below occasionally come to my 

1712
01:20:35,181 --> 01:20:37,800
place in Topanga,
but normally I go to them and they can't

1713
01:20:37,801 --> 01:20:40,710
hear when they're not here,
so I have to keep like going,

1714
01:20:40,711 --> 01:20:41,220
hey,
hey,

1715
01:20:41,221 --> 01:20:41,910
the mic,
you know,

1716
01:20:41,911 --> 01:20:46,911
there are a lot of them.
They're not used to talking on Mike's 

1717
01:20:46,911 --> 01:20:49,130
and all that,
but the other reason I got it is my 

1718
01:20:49,130 --> 01:20:51,450
buddy kyle actually pointed out to me 
that when you both have headphones,

1719
01:20:51,451 --> 01:20:56,451
you're both in a shared space and you're
much less likely to be thinking about 

1720
01:20:57,511 --> 01:21:00,030
your phone or whatever because you're 
both like,

1721
01:21:00,090 --> 01:21:01,350
I dunno what it does,
but it,

1722
01:21:01,380 --> 01:21:02,820
it seals it off in a way.

1723
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:04,230
Yeah.
We talked about that yesterday.

1724
01:21:04,231 --> 01:21:09,231
Actually.
Me and Eddie Bravo talked about it 

1725
01:21:09,231 --> 01:21:09,231
because he doesn't like to wear them 
because he doesn't like the sound of his

1726
01:21:09,231 --> 01:21:09,990
own voice.
And I said,

1727
01:21:10,050 --> 01:21:11,250
well,
he and I are so comfortable.

1728
01:21:11,251 --> 01:21:12,640
We'd been friends for so long.
I didn't.

1729
01:21:12,730 --> 01:21:17,730
We didn't need to wear them,
but I feel like when you're having a 

1730
01:21:17,730 --> 01:21:18,300
conversation with someone,
it cuts out everything else.

1731
01:21:18,360 --> 01:21:19,350
Right.
It's just youtube,

1732
01:21:19,380 --> 01:21:21,630
they're like,
there's no distractions in the room,

1733
01:21:21,631 --> 01:21:24,870
but if there were they would be less 
distracting because the headphones.

1734
01:21:25,100 --> 01:21:27,290
Well that's the thing I'm out,
like sitting in a,

1735
01:21:27,291 --> 01:21:30,170
in a campsite somewhere by a river or 
whatever.

1736
01:21:30,171 --> 01:21:33,010
There's a lot going on.
And the handheld microphone too.

1737
01:21:33,011 --> 01:21:35,730
It was a big thing and if you get a mic,
picks up everything,

1738
01:21:35,880 --> 01:21:37,830
then they pick up everything.
Everything.

1739
01:21:37,831 --> 01:21:39,690
Like they pick up some shit over by the 
outhouse,

1740
01:21:39,691 --> 01:21:40,690
you'd hear in the background.

1741
01:21:41,130 --> 01:21:44,250
It was using a lapel mics for awhile,
but they were um,

1742
01:21:44,260 --> 01:21:47,670
the directional is too much and people 
were complaining and like,

1743
01:21:47,671 --> 01:21:48,900
dude,
I can't in the car.

1744
01:21:48,901 --> 01:21:51,720
I can't hear you.
So I got the handheld.

1745
01:21:51,900 --> 01:21:53,310
It is an interesting thing,
right?

1746
01:21:53,311 --> 01:21:58,311
Because this is not something that it 
production company would ever get 

1747
01:21:58,311 --> 01:22:00,090
together and fund because they would say
if they did,

1748
01:22:00,210 --> 01:22:04,350
they'd have a sound guy and they'd have 
a like half the fun is watching you.

1749
01:22:04,351 --> 01:22:05,640
Well,
will this one sock these,

1750
01:22:05,641 --> 01:22:07,230
these mikes are bullshit,
right?

1751
01:22:07,231 --> 01:22:08,790
We're not doing that anymore.
You know,

1752
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:12,840
we've done a few from an iphone.
We used to do podcasts on a plane,

1753
01:22:13,060 --> 01:22:14,150
like we'd be,
you know,

1754
01:22:14,280 --> 01:22:19,280
me and Duncan are me and Ari or whoever 
it was would be on a plane next to each 

1755
01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:19,280
other.
I just take the iphone between us,

1756
01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:23,870
press record and start talking voice 
notes and turn into a podcast and it's 

1757
01:22:23,870 --> 01:22:23,870
not that bad.

1758
01:22:24,240 --> 01:22:26,160
Yeah,
I did that recently in the van.

1759
01:22:26,220 --> 01:22:27,780
I was driving.
I had some ideas.

1760
01:22:27,781 --> 01:22:30,540
I just grabbed my phone and started 
talking into it and I threw it up.

1761
01:22:30,840 --> 01:22:35,840
People like it because they knew one 
thing they know this is one of the 

1762
01:22:35,840 --> 01:22:39,441
things that's appealing about podcasts 
in general is that it's not produced 

1763
01:22:39,441 --> 01:22:39,570
right.
It's just this is what it is.

1764
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:44,600
You know?
It's like you've got an idea and I'm 

1765
01:22:44,600 --> 01:22:46,491
getting it right from Chris Ryan's head.
It's going right from his head right in 

1766
01:22:46,491 --> 01:22:47,030
that phone that's going right into my 
ears.

1767
01:22:47,040 --> 01:22:48,300
There's nothing,
there's no filters.

1768
01:22:48,301 --> 01:22:53,301
There's getting right into your head.
It's one of the weirdest things about 

1769
01:22:53,301 --> 01:22:55,941
podcasts in general,
is that the intimacy of your voice in 

1770
01:22:55,941 --> 01:23:00,111
someone else's head,
like I'm sure when you meet them they 

1771
01:23:00,111 --> 01:23:00,111
get weirded out.
Right?

1772
01:23:00,111 --> 01:23:03,260
A lot of people get really weird because
you got in their head and all of a 

1773
01:23:03,260 --> 01:23:03,260
sudden you're right in front of them.
Hey,

1774
01:23:03,260 --> 01:23:04,320
like,
yeah.

1775
01:23:04,321 --> 01:23:05,980
And it's,
it's strange like they

1776
01:23:05,980 --> 01:23:07,810
know you,
but you know,

1777
01:23:08,350 --> 01:23:12,220
they really do know you.
It's not like fame where you're an actor

1778
01:23:12,520 --> 01:23:13,270
and people like,
Oh,

1779
01:23:13,271 --> 01:23:14,210
I know your face.
Like,

1780
01:23:14,260 --> 01:23:15,730
yeah.
But yeah,

1781
01:23:15,731 --> 01:23:18,710
I mean people really do know Joe Rogan.
Yeah.

1782
01:23:19,010 --> 01:23:20,110
Strangely.
Yeah.

1783
01:23:20,470 --> 01:23:25,470
So there are parts I know both of us 
have parts of our lives we don't talk 

1784
01:23:25,470 --> 01:23:26,980
about on the podcast specifically your 
marriage.

1785
01:23:26,981 --> 01:23:29,770
I guess I don't like to talk too much,
but yeah,

1786
01:23:30,610 --> 01:23:31,680
I'm that way too.
I,

1787
01:23:31,930 --> 01:23:36,930
my impulse is to talk about everything.
Like on my impulse is like I got 

1788
01:23:36,930 --> 01:23:41,281
nothing.
I got no secrets because I feel like 

1789
01:23:41,281 --> 01:23:42,820
there's a,
like a revolutionary shamelessness.

1790
01:23:43,500 --> 01:23:44,410
Um,
you know,

1791
01:23:44,411 --> 01:23:48,040
I feel like I feel so privileged and 
largely thanks to you and Duncan.

1792
01:23:48,041 --> 01:23:53,041
Honestly,
when I started the podcast and you guys 

1793
01:23:53,041 --> 01:23:55,411
did that shrimp parade thing and that 
really built up my audience and to the 

1794
01:23:55,421 --> 01:24:00,421
point now where it paid,
it's self sustaining and it's my main 

1795
01:24:00,421 --> 01:24:00,421
gig.

1796
01:24:00,421 --> 01:24:00,610
That's awesome.
It is awesome.

1797
01:24:00,611 --> 01:24:02,380
It's incredible.
But it's like,

1798
01:24:02,381 --> 01:24:07,381
I feel like there's a responsibility I 
have in a way to express yourself 

1799
01:24:07,630 --> 01:24:12,630
shamelessly because everybody else has a
job they can get fired from or a 

1800
01:24:13,421 --> 01:24:18,070
marriage that they can get screwed.
The wife can leave them or they can.

1801
01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:21,880
I'm in vulnerable and so I kind of feel 
like,

1802
01:24:22,280 --> 01:24:24,430
all right,
so the cost of that,

1803
01:24:24,431 --> 01:24:29,431
you know,
every opportunity or every privilege 

1804
01:24:29,431 --> 01:24:31,360
comes with a responsibility.
The responsibility is like I got to talk

1805
01:24:31,361 --> 01:24:35,680
about shit that other people don't talk 
about so that it's out there.

1806
01:24:35,820 --> 01:24:40,820
Right.
And so my impulse is to just say 

1807
01:24:40,820 --> 01:24:40,820
everything,
you know,

1808
01:24:40,820 --> 01:24:43,261
and my sex life is really has been very 
interesting and I'd like to talk about 

1809
01:24:43,601 --> 01:24:45,850
it more,
but I don't want to,

1810
01:24:45,851 --> 01:24:50,851
you know,
other people never sort of said they 

1811
01:24:50,851 --> 01:24:50,851
were down for that,
you know,

1812
01:24:50,851 --> 01:24:50,851
so

1813
01:24:50,851 --> 01:24:55,390
that too,
that's magnified when you have children 

1814
01:24:55,390 --> 01:24:57,020
because they have no say,
well that's the vulnerability.

1815
01:24:57,840 --> 01:24:59,250
They put their kids out there and I'm 
like,

1816
01:24:59,251 --> 01:24:59,710
well,
okay,

1817
01:25:01,050 --> 01:25:02,460
I'm not saying it's the worst thing to 
do,

1818
01:25:02,490 --> 01:25:06,190
but it's not the child's choice.
And they're very young and you're making

1819
01:25:06,191 --> 01:25:09,750
a huge,
your look like whoever did what they did

1820
01:25:09,751 --> 01:25:11,070
to Michael Jackson,
right?

1821
01:25:11,190 --> 01:25:16,190
Yeah.
One of the things that they did is they 

1822
01:25:16,190 --> 01:25:16,380
made him famous way before he had any 
idea what the fuck that meant.

1823
01:25:16,500 --> 01:25:18,010
And they profited off of it.
Yeah.

1824
01:25:18,150 --> 01:25:19,630
They kind of pimped them out.
Right.

1825
01:25:19,910 --> 01:25:21,770
And that's kind of what's happened.
And I destroyed him,

1826
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:23,880
but ultimately the whole thing destroyed
him.

1827
01:25:23,881 --> 01:25:25,320
Right.
And um,

1828
01:25:26,430 --> 01:25:28,920
I just,
I don't want to be a part of that.

1829
01:25:28,980 --> 01:25:29,620
I just,
there's no,

1830
01:25:29,880 --> 01:25:31,800
that's smart.
I don't think it's intelligent.

1831
01:25:32,190 --> 01:25:35,670
And I also don't,
this is my real honest feelings.

1832
01:25:35,940 --> 01:25:40,940
I do not think that fame is a.
I don't think that people should aspire 

1833
01:25:41,281 --> 01:25:46,281
to it.
I think it should be something that 

1834
01:25:46,281 --> 01:25:46,470
happens if people like your work and 
then it's cool,

1835
01:25:46,471 --> 01:25:51,471
it's fine,
but I think there's way too much 

1836
01:25:51,471 --> 01:25:55,760
emphasis put on just trying to get 
attention and it's being rewarded and 

1837
01:25:57,121 --> 01:26:02,121
supported in this weird way.
There's nothing wrong with getting 

1838
01:26:02,121 --> 01:26:03,000
attention,
but it should make sense.

1839
01:26:03,410 --> 01:26:04,280
It should make sense.

1840
01:26:04,280 --> 01:26:06,860
There should be some reason.
And if it's out of balance,

1841
01:26:07,750 --> 01:26:08,550
you know,
you should,

1842
01:26:08,580 --> 01:26:12,710
you should probably look at like why?
Why is it out of balance.

1843
01:26:13,200 --> 01:26:18,200
Yeah.
And lots of things that attract 

1844
01:26:18,200 --> 01:26:19,160
attention are not things that we need.
We,

1845
01:26:19,260 --> 01:26:20,930
we want more of,
you know,

1846
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:22,410
like conflict.
Yes,

1847
01:26:22,470 --> 01:26:23,760
conflict.
That's a big one.

1848
01:26:23,870 --> 01:26:28,130
But it's also the.
I just fame itself.

1849
01:26:28,700 --> 01:26:33,700
One of the weirdest parts about it is 
that you have to constantly be checking 

1850
01:26:34,161 --> 01:26:36,770
yourself.
Like all these people are nice to you.

1851
01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:40,790
All these people are saying nice things 
to you or being mean to you.

1852
01:26:40,860 --> 01:26:41,970
You know,
one of the like Dave,

1853
01:26:41,980 --> 01:26:46,980
all people that you don't even know,
so you can't rely on them for your self 

1854
01:26:46,980 --> 01:26:48,620
esteem and you certainly can't rely on 
them for criticism.

1855
01:26:48,890 --> 01:26:53,890
You can't rely on them.
People you don't even know that don't 

1856
01:26:53,890 --> 01:26:53,890
care about you,
you know,

1857
01:26:53,890 --> 01:26:53,890
so you,
you,

1858
01:26:53,890 --> 01:26:57,590
you're in this weird position.
You have to be very careful with who you

1859
01:26:57,620 --> 01:27:02,620
communicate with because one of the 
weirdest things you'll see from famous 

1860
01:27:02,620 --> 01:27:05,801
people is all the sudden they get this 
very strange thing where they feel like 

1861
01:27:06,321 --> 01:27:09,080
people are supposed to do things for 
them and you know,

1862
01:27:09,081 --> 01:27:14,081
they don't,
they're not supposed to pay for things 

1863
01:27:14,081 --> 01:27:14,840
and everything's supposed to be easy and
they're supposed to get that.

1864
01:27:15,230 --> 01:27:16,640
That's a,
that's a weird one.

1865
01:27:16,641 --> 01:27:18,980
Like they don't respond to criticism.
Well,

1866
01:27:18,981 --> 01:27:21,920
they don't understand that they're still
a human being in the middle of growth.

1867
01:27:21,921 --> 01:27:22,970
No,
they're a fucking star.

1868
01:27:23,150 --> 01:27:25,780
I'm a fucking star and I want this and I
want it

1869
01:27:25,820 --> 01:27:27,250
now.
And they just like,

1870
01:27:27,260 --> 01:27:30,110
what kind of fucking bullshit is this?
Do you know who I am?

1871
01:27:30,170 --> 01:27:30,910
Yeah,
exactly.

1872
01:27:30,940 --> 01:27:35,940
We've seen,
we've all seen like a version of that 

1873
01:27:35,940 --> 01:27:38,651
right about it.
The problem though is that they know 

1874
01:27:39,471 --> 01:27:41,090
that their shit stinks.
Yes.

1875
01:27:41,120 --> 01:27:43,820
They know that they're human.
They know so they're.

1876
01:27:43,821 --> 01:27:48,821
So then they develop this sort of fraud,
a phobia that people are going to find 

1877
01:27:50,751 --> 01:27:52,970
out what they really are.
I mean,

1878
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:54,960
I've seen this with fashion models,
you know,

1879
01:27:55,010 --> 01:27:58,570
I used to hang out with a lot of fashion
models in Barcelona that,

1880
01:27:58,571 --> 01:28:03,571
you know,
that whole story where I lived in the 

1881
01:28:03,571 --> 01:28:03,571
mansion with the fashion models.
Did you talk about that?

1882
01:28:03,571 --> 01:28:03,590
Could be,
I don't know.

1883
01:28:03,760 --> 01:28:06,230
I'm not sure,
but looking track of what the fuck we've

1884
01:28:06,231 --> 01:28:09,200
talked about possible.
It's impossible.

1885
01:28:10,150 --> 01:28:10,730
Yeah.
Anyway,

1886
01:28:10,731 --> 01:28:12,420
so uh,
yeah,

1887
01:28:12,421 --> 01:28:17,421
I fashioned model become fame,
wealth people who are extremely wealthy 

1888
01:28:17,421 --> 01:28:22,240
and that gets back to the 70 grand a 
year thing and the whole sort of 

1889
01:28:22,240 --> 01:28:22,640
question of,
you know,

1890
01:28:23,120 --> 01:28:24,020
saturation,

1891
01:28:24,150 --> 01:28:25,050
you know,
what else it is,

1892
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:30,600
it becomes a real problem with things 
being too easy and life being like way 

1893
01:28:30,601 --> 01:28:35,601
to a patterned like you.
Everything is very predictable in terms 

1894
01:28:35,731 --> 01:28:38,310
of your success.
You have plenty of money.

1895
01:28:38,500 --> 01:28:42,680
You have a adulation from fans without 
any stress or direct.

1896
01:28:42,730 --> 01:28:45,120
Are you going to have a little bit of 
stress in terms of like trying to manage

1897
01:28:45,121 --> 01:28:50,121
your career,
but it's nothing like trying to make it 

1898
01:28:50,121 --> 01:28:52,600
that.
I don't know if I'm ever going to make 

1899
01:28:52,600 --> 01:28:54,351
it stress.
That's a totally different kind of 

1900
01:28:54,351 --> 01:28:56,001
stress.
I don't know if I'm ever going to be a 

1901
01:28:56,001 --> 01:28:56,001
success dress.
That's real shit that goes away once you

1902
01:28:56,001 --> 01:29:00,210
definitely become Kanye West or whoever 
the fuck you are and then you're subject

1903
01:29:00,211 --> 01:29:02,070
to your own demons because then you're 
alone.

1904
01:29:02,100 --> 01:29:04,680
You're really alone.
You can't even go to the grocery store.

1905
01:29:04,870 --> 01:29:07,110
You spend any time with Jim Carrey.
No,

1906
01:29:07,111 --> 01:29:09,420
I don't know.
I'd love to meet that guy.

1907
01:29:09,630 --> 01:29:11,910
He seems like he's in a weird stage of 
his life.

1908
01:29:12,270 --> 01:29:16,260
He seems to me like someone who,
who you talked about,

1909
01:29:16,290 --> 01:29:18,810
you know,
you get to that pinnacle and you have to

1910
01:29:18,811 --> 01:29:20,480
deal with your demons.
Yeah.

1911
01:29:20,520 --> 01:29:25,520
It seems like he's dealt with them and 
now he's come out the other side and 

1912
01:29:25,681 --> 01:29:30,681
he's in this very sort of this place of 
wisdom and uh,

1913
01:29:32,670 --> 01:29:34,100
and yeah,
it's,

1914
01:29:34,130 --> 01:29:35,130
I,
I just think he,

1915
01:29:35,430 --> 01:29:38,610
he sounded.
Russell brand is another guy who I think

1916
01:29:39,150 --> 01:29:44,150
I really admire what,
where they are in their lives and how 

1917
01:29:44,150 --> 01:29:48,051
they got there.
They sort of went through the fire and 

1918
01:29:48,051 --> 01:29:48,840
they've come out the other side somehow.
Rustled certainly has.

1919
01:29:48,841 --> 01:29:50,000
I know Russell,
he's,

1920
01:29:50,040 --> 01:29:50,820
he's a sweetie.

1921
01:29:51,090 --> 01:29:56,090
He really is a super sweet guy,
like genuine too and really trying to 

1922
01:29:56,090 --> 01:29:58,470
like be a better person and a better 
human and you know,

1923
01:29:58,770 --> 01:30:00,900
I don't agree with him on everything.
He gets a little social.

1924
01:30:00,901 --> 01:30:05,901
Justice warriors are on some things,
but I think it's just because he wants 

1925
01:30:05,901 --> 01:30:09,351
to do good and he's like leaning towards
good and he's leaning towards love and 

1926
01:30:09,351 --> 01:30:10,260
he's like,
it's all for the right reasons.

1927
01:30:10,261 --> 01:30:12,090
Like every,
even if I don't agree with them,

1928
01:30:12,091 --> 01:30:17,091
I see how he's thinking.
And even if I don't agree with Ms Dot 

1929
01:30:17,091 --> 01:30:17,091
[inaudible] do not agree.
It's not a hard.

1930
01:30:17,091 --> 01:30:17,091
Do not agree.
It's.

1931
01:30:17,091 --> 01:30:17,830
Yeah.
Yeah.

1932
01:30:18,030 --> 01:30:20,670
He's a fascinating guy.
I think,

1933
01:30:20,671 --> 01:30:21,810
uh,
if Jesus came back,

1934
01:30:21,811 --> 01:30:25,350
he'd be Russell brand probably.
Fuck a few less checks.

1935
01:30:26,710 --> 01:30:31,710
Maybe Jesus would go just swinging dick 
all over the place just to remove 

1936
01:30:31,710 --> 01:30:31,710
everybody,
have their ego.

1937
01:30:31,710 --> 01:30:33,330
Everybody.
You don't possess these women.

1938
01:30:33,660 --> 01:30:34,730
Uh,
years ago I,

1939
01:30:35,040 --> 01:30:36,420
uh,
I came back from Asia,

1940
01:30:36,421 --> 01:30:41,421
I was in Asia for a couple of years and 
I visited my best buddy in Paris and 

1941
01:30:41,421 --> 01:30:42,180
we're throwing a football around.
I remember.

1942
01:30:42,181 --> 01:30:47,181
And some backstreet in Paris,
which freaked out the per regions of 

1943
01:30:47,181 --> 01:30:49,440
course.
And my buddy's like the opposite of me.

1944
01:30:49,441 --> 01:30:51,960
He's religious,
he's disciplined,

1945
01:30:51,990 --> 01:30:54,870
he's speaks seven languages,
you know,

1946
01:30:55,080 --> 01:30:58,740
musical prodigy.
I'm a lazy fuck a girl growing up it was

1947
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:00,540
like I was kirk,
he was spock,

1948
01:31:00,570 --> 01:31:05,570
you know,
is that kind of dynamic half your 

1949
01:31:05,570 --> 01:31:05,570
audience wouldn't even know who we're 
talking about it.

1950
01:31:05,570 --> 01:31:06,810
They're not sad.
But,

1951
01:31:06,811 --> 01:31:08,520
um,
he,

1952
01:31:08,521 --> 01:31:10,320
uh,
which explains why I've always wanted to

1953
01:31:10,321 --> 01:31:14,370
fuck a green woman that got this thing.
But uh,

1954
01:31:14,400 --> 01:31:15,600
he said it to me.
He's like,

1955
01:31:15,660 --> 01:31:17,220
Chris,
I figured you out man,

1956
01:31:17,270 --> 01:31:18,690
as what's,
what's the deal?

1957
01:31:18,690 --> 01:31:20,400
He said,
you're the anti monk,

1958
01:31:21,030 --> 01:31:21,660
said,
what do you mean?

1959
01:31:21,661 --> 01:31:26,661
He said,
monks cut themselves off from the 

1960
01:31:26,661 --> 01:31:29,310
temptations of life in order to pursue a
spiritual path.

1961
01:31:29,750 --> 01:31:31,980
You're,
you're pursuing a spiritual path,

1962
01:31:31,981 --> 01:31:34,740
but it's by way of the temptations of 
life.

1963
01:31:34,741 --> 01:31:39,741
You immerse yourself in them because in 
those days I was doing a lot of drugs 

1964
01:31:39,741 --> 01:31:39,741
and you know,
whatever.

1965
01:31:40,260 --> 01:31:42,240
And uh,
I think he's right.

1966
01:31:42,630 --> 01:31:47,630
And in Buddhism there is a path of the 
drunken guru right the,

1967
01:31:48,780 --> 01:31:53,780
there,
there is a path of sex and altered 

1968
01:31:53,780 --> 01:31:56,390
states of consciousness and sort of,
you know,

1969
01:31:56,400 --> 01:32:01,150
William Blake said the palace of wisdom 
lies at the end of the road of excess.

1970
01:32:02,170 --> 01:32:04,750
You know?
And so someone like Russell brand,

1971
01:32:04,751 --> 01:32:07,440
I think that's his path.
He's gone through the,

1972
01:32:07,470 --> 01:32:12,470
the addictions and the orgies and all 
that stuff that a lot of people think 

1973
01:32:12,470 --> 01:32:14,080
would make them happy.
He's like,

1974
01:32:14,081 --> 01:32:18,520
check those boxes like now that didn't 
do it in a way that very few humans ever

1975
01:32:18,521 --> 01:32:23,521
get to check them.
Family is a beautiful man and a 

1976
01:32:23,521 --> 01:32:24,190
superstar.
And he came on the other side and became

1977
01:32:24,191 --> 01:32:27,070
this really conscious,
very spiritual person.

1978
01:32:27,420 --> 01:32:30,010
And very humble and a sweetie.
Nice guy.

1979
01:32:30,040 --> 01:32:34,600
I think humility is what you find if you
get through to the other side.

1980
01:32:34,660 --> 01:32:35,440
Yeah,
I think so.

1981
01:32:35,920 --> 01:32:40,920
I think if you.
But even when you get through the other 

1982
01:32:40,920 --> 01:32:40,920
side,
it's like there's no,

1983
01:32:40,920 --> 01:32:44,430
there's no destination.
It's not like a spot you get to like 

1984
01:32:44,430 --> 01:32:44,740
find that can relax.
I'm here.

1985
01:32:44,790 --> 01:32:46,900
Yeah.
Well he's used that phrase a minute ago.

1986
01:32:46,900 --> 01:32:47,670
Like,
you know,

1987
01:32:47,780 --> 01:32:49,540
trying to make it.
Yeah,

1988
01:32:49,600 --> 01:32:54,600
make it.
It's like it's as if you'll make it and 

1989
01:32:54,600 --> 01:32:55,540
then you'll have it made,
you know,

1990
01:32:55,550 --> 01:32:56,470
like what,
what,

1991
01:32:56,500 --> 01:32:59,680
what did we make?
What's made that make it thing is really

1992
01:32:59,681 --> 01:33:01,390
for a comic is just this,
uh,

1993
01:33:01,400 --> 01:33:06,250
the high likelihood of success is always
looming over you.

1994
01:33:06,550 --> 01:33:09,390
And what is success?
Being able to flick special.

1995
01:33:09,920 --> 01:33:13,060
I'm not even just being able to work.
Just being a working,

1996
01:33:13,390 --> 01:33:18,390
working comedian.
Just paying your rent with your 

1997
01:33:18,390 --> 01:33:18,390
standard.
That was always the dream.

1998
01:33:18,390 --> 01:33:19,870
Like every comic that starts out,
if they're being honest.

1999
01:33:19,970 --> 01:33:23,030
Fitzsimmons and I have talked about this
a hundred times because it was,

2000
01:33:23,350 --> 01:33:26,410
we'd never thought of a career.
I mean if it fits him is this one,

2001
01:33:26,411 --> 01:33:30,220
I think he's won at least two emmy's for
writing.

2002
01:33:30,970 --> 01:33:35,970
Brilliant guy and you know,
we were just two dorks to 21 year old 

2003
01:33:36,521 --> 01:33:39,200
dorks hanging out together in Boston and
we did.

2004
01:33:39,580 --> 01:33:42,000
You were a fucking martial arts expert 
in those.

2005
01:33:42,030 --> 01:33:43,450
A martial arts expert.
I was a Dork.

2006
01:33:43,451 --> 01:33:45,350
Dude.
I would get nervous talking.

2007
01:33:45,370 --> 01:33:48,610
I've talked about this.
I never could figure out why I freak out

2008
01:33:48,790 --> 01:33:50,680
when I would be about to talk to a bank 
teller,

2009
01:33:50,920 --> 01:33:53,500
like walking up to.
I'd get like social anxiety.

2010
01:33:53,860 --> 01:33:55,350
I would know.
I was nervous.

2011
01:33:55,360 --> 01:33:57,190
It's not a good place to look.
Nervous.

2012
01:33:57,380 --> 01:33:57,730
Not.
Yeah,

2013
01:33:57,731 --> 01:33:59,290
exactly.
I mean,

2014
01:33:59,320 --> 01:34:02,380
but back then it didn't make sense 
because I was fighting and I would still

2015
01:34:02,381 --> 01:34:06,670
get nervous talking to like any person 
who is in an official person,

2016
01:34:07,330 --> 01:34:11,260
any person,
like a teacher or a principal or anybody

2017
01:34:11,261 --> 01:34:14,320
that authority and authority figure.
I was super nervous talking to them,

2018
01:34:14,720 --> 01:34:19,720
but my wife gets out way around.
Anyone wearing a uniform freaks her out 

2019
01:34:19,720 --> 01:34:20,650
because she was in a war when she was a 
kid.

2020
01:34:20,680 --> 01:34:23,500
Oh Wow.
So like immigration guys.

2021
01:34:23,540 --> 01:34:25,870
She just,
she starts shaking and say workers.

2022
01:34:25,960 --> 01:34:26,980
Yeah.
Yeah.

2023
01:34:27,010 --> 01:34:27,850
No,
I hear you man.

2024
01:34:27,880 --> 01:34:29,800
Well,
uniform means uniform behavior,

2025
01:34:30,250 --> 01:34:31,540
right?
Uniform me.

2026
01:34:31,580 --> 01:34:36,310
Chicken goes sideways.
When's the last time you wore a tie into

2027
01:34:36,750 --> 01:34:41,750
uniforms?
Probably when I was taking the photos 

2028
01:34:41,750 --> 01:34:45,380
for my 19,
99 cd cover,

2029
01:34:45,690 --> 01:34:48,220
real seedy.
I decided to dress like a,

2030
01:34:48,340 --> 01:34:51,990
like old school.
Frank Sinatra just decided when I.

2031
01:34:52,090 --> 01:34:57,090
When I made the CD,
I was thinking I never wear a tie and a 

2032
01:34:57,090 --> 01:34:57,980
suit and a tie to be fun if I just 
decided to wear a suit and a

2033
01:34:57,980 --> 01:34:59,630
tie for the cover of this.
So that's it right there.

2034
01:34:59,870 --> 01:35:04,870
That's probably brad pack the last time.
I'm going to be some day.

2035
01:35:07,730 --> 01:35:12,730
Yeah.
That's the theme song to my podcast is 

2036
01:35:12,730 --> 01:35:14,620
you're going to die one day.
I don't want to give the end away,

2037
01:35:14,710 --> 01:35:17,210
but you're going to die one day.
That's a good song.

2038
01:35:17,211 --> 01:35:19,610
Carpet a fucking DMV.
Yeah.

2039
01:35:19,980 --> 01:35:20,870
Enjoy it.
I mean,

2040
01:35:20,930 --> 01:35:22,910
don't dwell on it too much.
I'll freak out.

2041
01:35:23,090 --> 01:35:24,290
You know?
Well,

2042
01:35:24,291 --> 01:35:27,470
it's like,
I think every young man should shave his

2043
01:35:27,471 --> 01:35:30,620
head like at 21 or something.
Shaved your head.

2044
01:35:31,040 --> 01:35:36,040
See yourself bald for a month or however
long it takes to grow back and it's 

2045
01:35:36,040 --> 01:35:36,440
like,
okay,

2046
01:35:36,500 --> 01:35:41,500
that's it.
You're not going to worry about Ted's 

2047
01:35:41,500 --> 01:35:41,500
though will say this,
but you have a normal head.

2048
01:35:41,540 --> 01:35:43,220
I don't know.
I've never shaved my head.

2049
01:35:43,221 --> 01:35:44,060
I don't know.
I have a friend.

2050
01:35:44,061 --> 01:35:49,061
It looks like his kid,
his parents never picked him up for the 

2051
01:35:49,061 --> 01:35:50,300
first year and otherwise to just let 
them lay down on a flat marble pillow.

2052
01:35:51,050 --> 01:35:56,050
His head is flat like a fucking pizza is
poor bastard on the top or the back of 

2053
01:35:56,120 --> 01:35:56,870
it.
It's flat.

2054
01:35:56,871 --> 01:36:00,650
I think his parents just ignore the shit
out of him and he's got a flat head.

2055
01:36:00,680 --> 01:36:03,230
You know about the flathead Indians.
Which ones are those?

2056
01:36:03,350 --> 01:36:06,950
There was a up in Idaho that area.
Northern.

2057
01:36:07,010 --> 01:36:07,540
Yeah,
they,

2058
01:36:07,550 --> 01:36:09,080
they would put.
Oh yeah,

2059
01:36:09,710 --> 01:36:14,710
yeah.
They put a board on the baby's head 

2060
01:36:14,710 --> 01:36:16,520
because the heads are so malleable and 
then tighten it and they look like 

2061
01:36:16,520 --> 01:36:18,260
coneheads,
like scare the fuck out of anybody.

2062
01:36:18,410 --> 01:36:22,310
I'm sure you saw those dudes riding up 
war paint.

2063
01:36:22,680 --> 01:36:23,660
Flatheads.

2064
01:36:24,010 --> 01:36:25,800
And that was a thing about,
um,

2065
01:36:26,120 --> 01:36:28,160
some of the,
I think was it,

2066
01:36:28,190 --> 01:36:33,190
was it Peru where they would do,
they would find a lot of these skulls 

2067
01:36:33,190 --> 01:36:35,330
from a certain period of time that had 
been elongated and you know,

2068
01:36:35,331 --> 01:36:37,700
the alien people went nutty.
Like this is it,

2069
01:36:37,970 --> 01:36:42,970
this is evidence,
evidence of contact the aliens they've 

2070
01:36:42,970 --> 01:36:44,540
been here,
but it's just boards.

2071
01:36:44,630 --> 01:36:47,480
They just put boards in the side of 
their heads and stretched her heads up.

2072
01:36:47,520 --> 01:36:52,520
Yeah.
They think they might've even been 

2073
01:36:52,520 --> 01:36:52,520
trying to emulate one of,
like,

2074
01:36:52,520 --> 01:36:56,980
originally the idea was bounced about 
that someone in the royal family in 

2075
01:36:58,280 --> 01:37:02,900
Egypt had deformities.
And that was one of the things that said

2076
01:37:02,901 --> 01:37:07,901
about king Tut.
Like King Tut was not a healthy person 

2077
01:37:07,901 --> 01:37:12,520
like that.
He might may very well have been the 

2078
01:37:12,520 --> 01:37:14,030
product of incest and that there was 
some gender.

2079
01:37:14,031 --> 01:37:14,960
Do you remember reading about this?

2080
01:37:15,110 --> 01:37:15,410
Right?
Yeah.

2081
01:37:15,411 --> 01:37:18,110
I know about the incest in the options.
Yeah.

2082
01:37:18,220 --> 01:37:21,910
That some of the like heads when you see
people like with like,

2083
01:37:21,911 --> 01:37:26,911
hey,
elongated heads and hieroglyphs and 

2084
01:37:26,911 --> 01:37:29,281
images,
they might have actually done that to 

2085
01:37:29,281 --> 01:37:31,300
try to replicate someone who had 
something fucked up to normalize it,

2086
01:37:31,360 --> 01:37:35,680
which might have been like a royal who 
had been like look at their debts.

2087
01:37:35,681 --> 01:37:37,540
His head.
That's his actual head.

2088
01:37:38,450 --> 01:37:39,760
So on the left.
Yeah.

2089
01:37:40,980 --> 01:37:42,920
That's to tongue cut.
Is that his real head?

2090
01:37:44,890 --> 01:37:45,940
Peru,
Peru.

2091
01:37:46,080 --> 01:37:46,810
Oh,
these are giants

2092
01:37:46,810 --> 01:37:48,510
science goals.
But they have.

2093
01:37:48,630 --> 01:37:53,630
They have King Tut's head too though.
You see if you can google king Tut's at 

2094
01:37:53,630 --> 01:37:56,030
the ones improved.
They know they're pretty like 90

2095
01:37:56,120 --> 01:37:59,010
with a high degree of certainty.
I don't wanna give you a number,

2096
01:37:59,160 --> 01:38:03,200
but that they use boards and and example
of that is in Spanish.

2097
01:38:04,220 --> 01:38:09,220
Look at what tufts had.
Must've looked like it was all fucking 

2098
01:38:09,220 --> 01:38:09,220
weird.
It was all stretched out.

2099
01:38:09,220 --> 01:38:10,650
Like look at that.
Like if you saw,

2100
01:38:10,680 --> 01:38:14,490
if you saw that on the ship of a 
spaceship on the deck,

2101
01:38:14,760 --> 01:38:16,110
like walking around and I'm like Oh my 
God,

2102
01:38:16,111 --> 01:38:18,150
that's the alien.
Oh he must be from another planet.

2103
01:38:18,240 --> 01:38:19,860
Right.
Like if you were on a spaceship,

2104
01:38:20,250 --> 01:38:22,780
say if you watch star trek and that dude
walks by like,

2105
01:38:22,790 --> 01:38:27,790
well for sure that dude wants to be 
playing someone from another Martini on 

2106
01:38:27,790 --> 01:38:29,130
his head.
The top of his head is flat.

2107
01:38:29,370 --> 01:38:34,370
There's always an extra brain.
It looks like there's like 10 percent 

2108
01:38:34,370 --> 01:38:34,370
extra brain.
Maybe more.

2109
01:38:34,370 --> 01:38:36,330
What?
What the fuck is going on back there?

2110
01:38:37,350 --> 01:38:42,120
Here's the flathead Indians.
This is a painting of Caitlin did at the

2111
01:38:42,121 --> 01:38:45,900
babies that would make you very non 
aerodynamic.

2112
01:38:46,720 --> 01:38:51,630
You'd be like a land rover defender,
like a big flat square thing.

2113
01:38:51,690 --> 01:38:54,780
Similar schools though.
Oh Wow.

2114
01:38:56,490 --> 01:39:01,490
That normalizing crazy.
Looking in a royal weirdness.

2115
01:39:01,920 --> 01:39:04,770
You ever hear Spanish people speak?
They have the list.

2116
01:39:05,750 --> 01:39:10,750
Will they say that?
Because one of the kings had a list and 

2117
01:39:10,750 --> 01:39:12,900
then all the court deers started 
replicating it to seem cool.

2118
01:39:13,050 --> 01:39:18,050
You had told me about that and I had 
forgotten when it came up the other day 

2119
01:39:18,050 --> 01:39:18,830
when someone was bringing up a beat and 
then.

2120
01:39:19,580 --> 01:39:24,580
Yeah.
And then I remembered it after the 

2121
01:39:24,580 --> 01:39:24,580
podcast was over.
Yeah.

2122
01:39:24,580 --> 01:39:25,320
I don't know that that's true that.
I mean,

2123
01:39:25,350 --> 01:39:29,310
I haven't looked it up if it's 
historically accurate or even if there's

2124
01:39:29,311 --> 01:39:32,040
a way to know because there are no 
recordings.

2125
01:39:32,040 --> 01:39:33,720
Right.
Do you know the powdered wig one?

2126
01:39:34,230 --> 01:39:35,140
Do you know what?
No,

2127
01:39:35,200 --> 01:39:36,210
no.
That's the best.

2128
01:39:36,211 --> 01:39:38,280
Dad is a weird one that came from 
syphilis.

2129
01:39:38,400 --> 01:39:39,450
Really?
Yeah.

2130
01:39:39,451 --> 01:39:39,840
Yeah,
yeah.

2131
01:39:39,841 --> 01:39:40,710
Yeah.
How?

2132
01:39:40,780 --> 01:39:42,670
Because men started getting syphilis,
find,

2133
01:39:42,750 --> 01:39:44,700
find out what year it was.
I forget what year.

2134
01:39:44,701 --> 01:39:47,940
We just brought it up recently,
but there was a royal family,

2135
01:39:48,540 --> 01:39:53,540
I think two brothers.
They both had syphilis and they started 

2136
01:39:53,540 --> 01:39:54,810
losing their hair and a lot of men were 
losing their hair to syphilis back then.

2137
01:39:54,811 --> 01:39:56,550
They just had it.
Nobody knew what the fuck it was.

2138
01:39:56,551 --> 01:40:01,551
Right?
So they would make wigs and the more 

2139
01:40:01,551 --> 01:40:03,120
expensive,
more expensive the wig was,

2140
01:40:03,150 --> 01:40:08,150
the bigger would be.
So the really rich people would be big 

2141
01:40:08,150 --> 01:40:08,150
wigs,
big wigs.

2142
01:40:08,150 --> 01:40:12,891
That's where big waves come from and 
they literally put this style on to mask

2143
01:40:13,741 --> 01:40:15,870
the effects of syphilis.
Jesus,

2144
01:40:16,170 --> 01:40:17,130
it's a great story.

2145
01:40:17,160 --> 01:40:19,230
I didn't know syphilis made your hair 
fell fall.

2146
01:40:19,231 --> 01:40:19,740
Fall.
Yeah.

2147
01:40:19,741 --> 01:40:21,480
You've teeth rot out.
You're falling apart,

2148
01:40:21,481 --> 01:40:26,481
man.
And your nervous system gets shoot 

2149
01:40:26,481 --> 01:40:29,250
shooting.
You're rotten ges into somebody and 

2150
01:40:29,250 --> 01:40:31,011
given it to them too.
And you don't even know what the hell's 

2151
01:40:31,011 --> 01:40:31,011
going on.
Louis the 14th.

2152
01:40:31,011 --> 01:40:32,640
He was only 17 when his mom started 
thinning.

2153
01:40:33,350 --> 01:40:35,520
Yeah.
So I'm 16,

2154
01:40:35,521 --> 01:40:38,190
Fifty five when the King of France 
started losing his hair.

2155
01:40:39,360 --> 01:40:39,970
And so,
uh,

2156
01:40:40,030 --> 01:40:42,200
if you scroll down,
it goes into the,

2157
01:40:42,220 --> 01:40:46,260
the whole syphilis thing we get out.
So where,

2158
01:40:46,270 --> 01:40:49,500
where's the syphilis part mentioned?
Up above that.

2159
01:40:49,501 --> 01:40:50,890
He probably had buck and crazy.
Oh,

2160
01:40:50,900 --> 01:40:53,710
brother's head stuff.
Apparently everybody it back then.

2161
01:40:53,750 --> 01:40:54,100
And you just

2162
01:40:54,100 --> 01:40:56,530
imagine these people.
I mean they only lived to be 30.

2163
01:40:56,770 --> 01:41:01,770
The syphilis outbreak sparked a surge 
and wig making victims hid their 

2164
01:41:01,770 --> 01:41:06,631
baldness as well as bloody sores that 
scoured their faces with wigs made out 

2165
01:41:06,631 --> 01:41:10,951
of horse goat or human hair.
Perutz were also created a coded rather 

2166
01:41:10,951 --> 01:41:15,721
with powder sentence with lavender or 
orange to hide any funky aromas.

2167
01:41:15,970 --> 01:41:18,850
Although common wigs were not exactly 
stylish,

2168
01:41:19,180 --> 01:41:23,530
they were just a shameful necessity.
So the King of France started losing his

2169
01:41:23,531 --> 01:41:26,740
hair and 1655.
And that's when everybody hopped on.

2170
01:41:26,741 --> 01:41:29,290
And his cousin Charles,
the second to the same thing,

2171
01:41:29,291 --> 01:41:30,640
both men likely had syphilis.

2172
01:41:33,580 --> 01:41:38,580
Syphilis created a whole,
like a thing where like judges would 

2173
01:41:38,580 --> 01:41:39,940
wear those wigs,
powdered wigs.

2174
01:41:39,980 --> 01:41:41,650
They would look like they were 
important.

2175
01:41:41,651 --> 01:41:43,420
People look at my wig,
you know,

2176
01:41:43,421 --> 01:41:46,510
we're doing right now.
Tribalizing right now.

2177
01:41:46,600 --> 01:41:48,730
Yeah.
So we're looking at our own culture,

2178
01:41:49,120 --> 01:41:50,620
British culture in this case,
but,

2179
01:41:51,010 --> 01:41:56,010
and,
and seeing how it's all this arbitrary 

2180
01:41:56,010 --> 01:41:56,560
silliness.
And that's travel.

2181
01:41:56,590 --> 01:41:58,760
That's what travel does for sure.
You know,

2182
01:41:58,780 --> 01:42:03,780
because you see it in other cultures and
then you look back at your own and 

2183
01:42:03,780 --> 01:42:03,780
you're like,
oh shit,

2184
01:42:03,780 --> 01:42:05,590
we do weird shit to fuck.
We're all weird.

2185
01:42:05,591 --> 01:42:08,460
There is no,
it's like the uh,

2186
01:42:08,830 --> 01:42:13,830
what is an Einstein right?
That there's no fixed point from which 

2187
01:42:13,830 --> 01:42:15,580
to observe anything.
You're always on a moving.

2188
01:42:15,790 --> 01:42:20,790
Your perspective is always mobile.
So there is no objective truth.

2189
01:42:21,370 --> 01:42:26,370
Culturally it's,
it's all looking at one thing from 

2190
01:42:26,370 --> 01:42:26,370
another thing in both of them are 
moving.

2191
01:42:26,800 --> 01:42:28,360
Yeah.
I love that shit.

2192
01:42:28,480 --> 01:42:29,730
Yeah.
Because,

2193
01:42:30,040 --> 01:42:32,320
and again,
I think it leads to humility.

2194
01:42:32,440 --> 01:42:33,610
I think so too.
You know,

2195
01:42:33,910 --> 01:42:36,730
I think all roads lead to humility.
Ultimately,

2196
01:42:36,731 --> 01:42:40,150
it just leads to a greater perspective.
I mean if you live in a small town,

2197
01:42:40,151 --> 01:42:42,100
and I'm not knocking Ohio,
Jamie,

2198
01:42:42,430 --> 01:42:47,430
but if you live in a small town in Ohio,
that's what you're used to and you kind 

2199
01:42:47,430 --> 01:42:51,281
of like develop your pattern of what you
expect to see in the world based on 

2200
01:42:51,281 --> 01:42:51,970
what's around you in a,
in a very close,

2201
01:42:51,971 --> 01:42:54,850
immediate area,
but if you're in the fucking rain forest

2202
01:42:54,851 --> 01:42:59,851
to Bolivia and you're hanging out with 
these tribal folks who are going to go 

2203
01:42:59,851 --> 01:43:02,500
hunt a monkey and you're with them on a 
monkey hunt and they're all excited,

2204
01:43:02,501 --> 01:43:07,501
they shoot this monkey out of a tree 
with a bow and Arrow they made 

2205
01:43:07,501 --> 01:43:09,691
themselves and then they're cooking this
monkey over a fire and throwing wet 

2206
01:43:09,691 --> 01:43:09,691
leaves on it,
smoking it,

2207
01:43:09,691 --> 01:43:11,780
and you're like,
what the fuck?

2208
01:43:11,780 --> 01:43:14,320
And these people do this every day and 
they're going to die in this forest.

2209
01:43:14,540 --> 01:43:15,400
I mean,
this is what they.

2210
01:43:15,450 --> 01:43:16,840
This is what they do.
This is how they live.

2211
01:43:16,960 --> 01:43:18,670
And for you it's like I gotta get Outta 
here.

2212
01:43:18,850 --> 01:43:19,750
For them,
this is like,

2213
01:43:19,930 --> 01:43:24,370
this is the small town in Ohio.
There's just a small town in Ohio in the

2214
01:43:24,371 --> 01:43:26,620
jungle like this.
To them,

2215
01:43:26,621 --> 01:43:30,250
this is their world and maybe 
interestingly for you,

2216
01:43:30,251 --> 01:43:31,750
it isn't.
I gotta get Outta here.

2217
01:43:31,810 --> 01:43:35,800
Maybe it's like this is where I should,
should have been my whole life.

2218
01:43:36,160 --> 01:43:41,160
There are thousands of cases of people 
from civilization running away to go 

2219
01:43:41,981 --> 01:43:46,981
native.
There are no historical cases that I 

2220
01:43:46,981 --> 01:43:48,760
know of where native people have chosen 
to come and live in civilization.

2221
01:43:48,850 --> 01:43:53,850
Yeah.
I hate to beat a dead horse because I 

2222
01:43:53,850 --> 01:43:53,850
always it with Sebastian Junger's

2223
01:43:53,850 --> 01:43:54,920
tribe is amazing book.
I really enjoyed that.

2224
01:43:55,110 --> 01:43:57,110
I talk about too much.
It's one of those things.

2225
01:43:57,160 --> 01:43:58,270
It's good to me.

2226
01:43:59,150 --> 01:44:00,920
It's uh,
it is really good.

2227
01:44:01,280 --> 01:44:04,250
I've read it three times.
It's a short book.

2228
01:44:04,350 --> 01:44:05,330
Yeah,
it's one of,

2229
01:44:05,331 --> 01:44:10,331
it's uh,
it covers a lot of the same ground that 

2230
01:44:10,331 --> 01:44:10,331
I cover in civilized to death.
Actually.

2231
01:44:10,331 --> 01:44:14,950
I quote him in civilized to death and 
some of them we have some of the same 

2232
01:44:14,950 --> 01:44:14,950
sources,
but yeah,

2233
01:44:14,950 --> 01:44:16,730
he looked at some of the,
that uh,

2234
01:44:17,240 --> 01:44:22,240
those accounts of people running away to
go live with the natives and it makes 

2235
01:44:22,240 --> 01:44:22,490
sense.
Totally makes sense.

2236
01:44:22,491 --> 01:44:24,420
Like a dog you ever read?
Um,

2237
01:44:25,040 --> 01:44:27,920
call of the Wild Jack London.
London,

2238
01:44:27,921 --> 01:44:29,890
yeah.
It's a school.

2239
01:44:30,040 --> 01:44:35,040
It's a very good book and it's about a 
husky who goes and lives with the 

2240
01:44:35,040 --> 01:44:38,921
wolves.
It's essentially the story of the 

2241
01:44:38,921 --> 01:44:41,591
domesticated being going and living with
the wild iterations of that same being,

2242
01:44:42,381 --> 01:44:47,381
right?
So it's like one of us and going to go 

2243
01:44:47,381 --> 01:44:49,580
live in the Amazon or whatever.
There's a fantastic book if you like.

2244
01:44:49,581 --> 01:44:52,400
That kind of thing is at play in the 
fields of the Lord.

2245
01:44:52,490 --> 01:44:54,740
I've heard that,
but I never read that one book,

2246
01:44:54,760 --> 01:44:56,210
man.
Peter Matheson.

2247
01:44:56,650 --> 01:44:57,940
That's a book,
right?

2248
01:44:58,140 --> 01:44:59,690
Isn't there?
Probably 30 years old,

2249
01:44:59,691 --> 01:45:04,691
maybe more.
And it was made into a film starring 

2250
01:45:04,691 --> 01:45:06,560
down Daryl Hannah and Tom Waits.
And uh,

2251
01:45:06,800 --> 01:45:08,420
who else?
John Lithgow,

2252
01:45:08,421 --> 01:45:10,250
Kathy Bates.
Incredible,

2253
01:45:10,490 --> 01:45:11,600
incredible cast.

2254
01:45:12,940 --> 01:45:17,940
There's something that you get from 
escaping civilization that you,

2255
01:45:20,360 --> 01:45:25,360
if you don't know,
you're missing it until you're out 

2256
01:45:25,360 --> 01:45:25,360
there.
When you're out there,

2257
01:45:25,360 --> 01:45:26,590
and I'm sure you experienced this in 
your travels,

2258
01:45:26,920 --> 01:45:31,920
there's,
there's a certain detachment from the 

2259
01:45:31,920 --> 01:45:35,431
masses,
like just just just to be out of the 

2260
01:45:35,431 --> 01:45:35,620
hive and the influence of all the people
around you.

2261
01:45:35,650 --> 01:45:40,650
As weird as it seems,
there's this energy that we're all 

2262
01:45:40,650 --> 01:45:44,371
exchanging and these giant hives 
together and some people live off of it 

2263
01:45:44,371 --> 01:45:47,791
like those New York City people like my 
friend Jeff lives in New York City is 

2264
01:45:47,791 --> 01:45:48,880
always going to live in New York City.
This is what I like.

2265
01:45:49,090 --> 01:45:50,320
He likes it.
I love it.

2266
01:45:50,350 --> 01:45:52,360
He's walking through the street punk.
Bam,

2267
01:45:52,390 --> 01:45:53,560
Bam.
Yes.

2268
01:45:53,830 --> 01:45:55,270
That's his thing.
To me,

2269
01:45:55,271 --> 01:45:56,080
I'm like,
wow,

2270
01:45:56,140 --> 01:45:57,580
I'm always my.
My thought is always,

2271
01:45:57,610 --> 01:45:59,620
how do you guys do this?
How do you guys do this?

2272
01:45:59,650 --> 01:46:02,050
That's all I ever think.
How the fuck do you guys do this for him

2273
01:46:02,051 --> 01:46:05,140
is how could you live any other way,
but the people that.

2274
01:46:05,670 --> 01:46:07,770
But he has got a good life,
so he's got.

2275
01:46:07,960 --> 01:46:10,600
He enjoys what he does.
He's a fulfilled life.

2276
01:46:10,630 --> 01:46:15,630
He's happy,
but if you didn't think were talking 

2277
01:46:15,630 --> 01:46:16,530
about the same thing I'm talking about.
Jordy,

2278
01:46:16,990 --> 01:46:19,330
have you ever had got it?
Nepal.

2279
01:46:19,450 --> 01:46:19,930
Oh,
it hurts.

2280
01:46:19,960 --> 01:46:23,450
Rough.
Your farts smell really interesting when

2281
01:46:23,530 --> 01:46:28,530
you might've got a.
got a too bad because I have a friend 

2282
01:46:28,530 --> 01:46:29,080
who got really bad where he's sick in 
the hospital for like two days.

2283
01:46:29,430 --> 01:46:34,430
Yeah.
I didn't go to the hospital by that 

2284
01:46:34,430 --> 01:46:34,430
point.
I had been traveling for a few years.

2285
01:46:34,430 --> 01:46:34,500
You already.
I've had hepatitis.

2286
01:46:35,220 --> 01:46:39,000
I mean I've had some.
I've had to,

2287
01:46:39,001 --> 01:46:40,860
you know.
Yeah.

2288
01:46:40,861 --> 01:46:45,861
I spent three days in a room in Polinsky
shitting and puking into the same 

2289
01:46:46,921 --> 01:46:49,140
plastic bag.
Oh boy.

2290
01:46:49,200 --> 01:46:50,160
Three days in the same

2291
01:46:50,160 --> 01:46:52,290
bag.
What is it like after day three?

2292
01:46:53,720 --> 01:46:57,370
If you had the worst enemy?
It was day one.

2293
01:46:57,470 --> 01:46:58,770
Matthew.
On the third floor.

2294
01:46:58,790 --> 01:47:02,130
There's worst enemy was just standing 
there smoking a cigarette.

2295
01:47:02,131 --> 01:47:04,500
Would you drop that bag on the mother?
Mercy.

2296
01:47:05,090 --> 01:47:07,320
Mercy.
I don't have any enemies that.

2297
01:47:07,930 --> 01:47:12,930
Yeah,
you'd have to really hate somebody for 

2298
01:47:12,930 --> 01:47:12,930
that.
One of the funniest thing about that was

2299
01:47:12,930 --> 01:47:15,120
I came out of that room after I.
It might've been two days.

2300
01:47:15,121 --> 01:47:16,680
I don't know,
but it came out of that room,

2301
01:47:17,430 --> 01:47:18,660
you know,
Pale,

2302
01:47:18,661 --> 01:47:23,661
emaciated,
just totally drained and I went out on 

2303
01:47:23,661 --> 01:47:25,630
the terrorists of this Pelinka ever been
there.

2304
01:47:26,110 --> 01:47:27,000
Oh,
amazing.

2305
01:47:27,001 --> 01:47:31,890
Mayan Ruins and lots of magic mushrooms.
Once I hit one to teach an Eatsa,

2306
01:47:32,330 --> 01:47:34,140
a teaching school teaching,
he says,

2307
01:47:34,141 --> 01:47:36,360
much more sort of commercialized only 
case.

2308
01:47:36,361 --> 01:47:40,240
Pretty wild stuff.
Taloon was another one that's out on its

2309
01:47:40,370 --> 01:47:42,220
own or is that my hands mindset?

2310
01:47:42,220 --> 01:47:43,530
Both money.
Anyway,

2311
01:47:43,531 --> 01:47:46,090
I come out and there's this woman there,
this German woman,

2312
01:47:46,091 --> 01:47:49,140
and we start chatting a little bit and 
she,

2313
01:47:49,520 --> 01:47:54,520
and this was at a time in my life where 
I was really nervous around women and 

2314
01:47:54,520 --> 01:47:58,970
whatever,
and this woman was like super into me 

2315
01:47:58,970 --> 01:47:59,280
and I was like,
I was like,

2316
01:47:59,281 --> 01:48:02,030
I could not fuck you.
Like I just,

2317
01:48:02,100 --> 01:48:03,300
there's no,
I didn't do much.

2318
01:48:03,330 --> 01:48:08,330
I just saw it was,
felt so sick and horrible and it turned 

2319
01:48:08,330 --> 01:48:08,430
out later.
I got to know her a little bit.

2320
01:48:08,431 --> 01:48:11,730
She was really into punk music and she 
thought I looked like johnny rotten.

2321
01:48:12,490 --> 01:48:14,800
So she thought you were cute because you
looked at John Ross.

2322
01:48:14,810 --> 01:48:18,120
I looked like I was about to die.
That was the end of that.

2323
01:48:18,121 --> 01:48:20,730
Look for people out there that you might
go camping.

2324
01:48:21,090 --> 01:48:24,060
Please just get a gravity filter.
Don't get Giardia.

2325
01:48:24,090 --> 01:48:25,290
You can.
It's really easy.

2326
01:48:25,380 --> 01:48:27,600
It's real and there's also a thing 
called a steri pen.

2327
01:48:27,840 --> 01:48:28,890
Steady parents.
Wonderful.

2328
01:48:29,340 --> 01:48:34,340
Take the Steri pen.
You run it around in the water for a 

2329
01:48:34,340 --> 01:48:36,210
certain amount of time and it kills 
everything bad in the water and you even

2330
01:48:36,211 --> 01:48:40,040
taste it doesn't taste any different.
It's literally like UV light.

2331
01:48:40,830 --> 01:48:42,690
There's a bunch of like stereo pens,
a good one,

2332
01:48:42,930 --> 01:48:45,600
but these gravity filters are amazing 
and they have pumps.

2333
01:48:45,750 --> 01:48:48,060
They have another one.
You can take some water and you pump it,

2334
01:48:48,180 --> 01:48:53,180
you pump it and it goes through the 
filter into your water bottle and you 

2335
01:48:53,180 --> 01:48:55,020
can drink it.
You can clean up all like 99 point nine,

2336
01:48:55,021 --> 01:48:58,740
nine percent of all the bullshit with 
just a good filter and it doesn't.

2337
01:48:58,770 --> 01:49:00,210
You don't have to drop the chemicals in 
there.

2338
01:49:00,300 --> 01:49:02,580
Some people bring those.
Yeah,

2339
01:49:02,581 --> 01:49:05,100
I have a tablet and stuff like that,
but you don't need to,

2340
01:49:05,101 --> 01:49:07,060
but please don't drink at a creek folks.

2341
01:49:08,110 --> 01:49:11,490
It could be dead yards up.
I don't know if you.

2342
01:49:11,491 --> 01:49:16,491
If you pull this up,
I just recently I read a thing online 

2343
01:49:16,491 --> 01:49:19,581
saying that like it's almost never 
necessary to filter your water when 

2344
01:49:19,581 --> 01:49:23,721
you're in when you're camping,
and I've always filtered my water 

2345
01:49:23,721 --> 01:49:25,230
camping,
but it was this thing where they did all

2346
01:49:25,231 --> 01:49:30,231
these.
They took all these samples of creeks 

2347
01:49:30,231 --> 01:49:32,930
from creeks and and like apparently 
they're like self correcting mechanism 

2348
01:49:33,180 --> 01:49:38,180
nature,
but if something's dead hundred yards 

2349
01:49:38,180 --> 01:49:38,180
up,
you're fucked.

2350
01:49:38,180 --> 01:49:40,500
If you don't want that,
it's not worth it.

2351
01:49:40,501 --> 01:49:43,020
The gravity filter so fucking easy.
It's like if you.

2352
01:49:43,070 --> 01:49:48,070
You could take the risk and shit your 
brains out for three days or you can 

2353
01:49:48,070 --> 01:49:48,430
just enjoy with water

2354
01:49:48,430 --> 01:49:53,430
from the same place.
I think shitting your brains out for 

2355
01:49:53,430 --> 01:49:53,430
three days is a good experience.
Yeah.

2356
01:49:53,430 --> 01:49:54,190
It's like an ordeal.
Poison,

2357
01:49:54,191 --> 01:49:54,750
right?
Yeah.

2358
01:49:57,160 --> 01:49:59,560
Do you ever get high from vomiting?
No.

2359
01:49:59,610 --> 01:50:00,610
Have you?
Yeah.

2360
01:50:00,700 --> 01:50:01,360
Whoa.
Yeah.

2361
01:50:01,361 --> 01:50:03,220
Because when you vomit,
you get all these endorphins.

2362
01:50:03,490 --> 01:50:06,820
You don't feel great after you vomit.
I felt better.

2363
01:50:07,040 --> 01:50:09,810
Yeah,
go with gray.

2364
01:50:10,360 --> 01:50:12,450
It's true.
I'm relatively great.

2365
01:50:12,520 --> 01:50:15,580
Last time I did some serious vomiting 
because I had food poisoning,

2366
01:50:16,030 --> 01:50:19,870
but I guess I was about 10 years ago I 
had some pretty serious food poisoning.

2367
01:50:19,900 --> 01:50:23,200
It was just hurl anatomy.
That was the last real,

2368
01:50:23,320 --> 01:50:26,630
real like unstoppable.
Yeah.

2369
01:50:26,870 --> 01:50:30,020
Well it's just coming out and just a fat
tube of it.

2370
01:50:30,550 --> 01:50:32,700
You ever have a colonic irrigation?
No,

2371
01:50:33,080 --> 01:50:36,400
not into things going in my,
but I don't believe.

2372
01:50:36,401 --> 01:50:40,840
I don't believe that that is necessarily
a healthy thing either.

2373
01:50:41,620 --> 01:50:46,620
I don't believe it's not that it's,
but this all the stuff that people 

2374
01:50:46,620 --> 01:50:46,900
saying that it's healthy for you.

2375
01:50:46,900 --> 01:50:51,900
I'm like,
I don't necessarily think it is a while 

2376
01:50:51,900 --> 01:50:51,900
about that.
You know,

2377
01:50:51,900 --> 01:50:53,410
I sent you an email about him.
Actually,

2378
01:50:53,411 --> 01:50:54,570
he's.
He's like,

2379
01:50:54,580 --> 01:50:55,810
you know what?
I am the big beard.

2380
01:50:56,320 --> 01:50:57,340
He's a fan of yours.
Oh,

2381
01:50:57,341 --> 01:50:57,830
okay.
Yeah,

2382
01:50:57,831 --> 01:50:59,800
I was.
I was with him in Tucson and he,

2383
01:50:59,890 --> 01:51:02,200
he saw,
he's an old friend of Paul stamets.

2384
01:51:02,560 --> 01:51:04,310
He was at Harvard.
Yeah,

2385
01:51:04,990 --> 01:51:05,860
I can.
I'll hook you up.

2386
01:51:05,861 --> 01:51:09,430
He is.
He ever comes to La.

2387
01:51:09,700 --> 01:51:11,920
He's,
he was the most famous doctor in America

2388
01:51:11,921 --> 01:51:12,780
for years.
He,

2389
01:51:12,781 --> 01:51:13,510
he,
um,

2390
01:51:13,900 --> 01:51:16,810
but he's really interesting because he 
was at Harvard with leary.

2391
01:51:16,811 --> 01:51:21,040
He studied under Richard Evans.
Shelties is undergrad degrees in botany.

2392
01:51:21,430 --> 01:51:26,430
Richard Evans,
shelties as the guy who basically 

2393
01:51:26,430 --> 01:51:29,400
discovered in Camas,
hundreds of psychoactive plants in the 

2394
01:51:29,400 --> 01:51:30,580
Amazon,
you know,

2395
01:51:30,970 --> 01:51:32,920
amazing dude.
Anyway,

2396
01:51:33,100 --> 01:51:38,100
um,
so andrew was right in the mix and he 

2397
01:51:38,100 --> 01:51:41,131
sort of was central in leary getting in 
trouble because Andrew wrote an article 

2398
01:51:42,281 --> 01:51:47,281
in the Harvard Crimson criticizing leary
for indiscriminately giving psilocybin 

2399
01:51:50,261 --> 01:51:51,070
to students.

2400
01:51:51,460 --> 01:51:54,550
And that's what triggered the Tom after 
that.

2401
01:51:54,910 --> 01:51:58,870
Anyway,
Andrew went onto Harvard med school,

2402
01:51:59,440 --> 01:52:02,110
residency at mass,
this mass general in Boston,

2403
01:52:02,111 --> 01:52:07,111
like top top flight academic stuff,
but instead of he got his md but then he

2404
01:52:07,961 --> 01:52:11,740
went and worked at the National 
Institutes of health in Bethesda,

2405
01:52:11,741 --> 01:52:14,590
Maryland,
the main government research center.

2406
01:52:15,030 --> 01:52:20,030
So like early seventies I think.
And he has never wavered in his 

2407
01:52:23,321 --> 01:52:27,160
understanding that drugs are not 
necessarily bad.

2408
01:52:27,190 --> 01:52:31,030
And so he did these double blind studies
about marijuana.

2409
01:52:31,060 --> 01:52:36,060
The first,
I believe double blind studies of 

2410
01:52:36,060 --> 01:52:36,850
marijuana where he said like,
okay,

2411
01:52:37,210 --> 01:52:42,210
you know,
people have tested marijuana and they 

2412
01:52:42,210 --> 01:52:42,210
say,
oh,

2413
01:52:42,210 --> 01:52:45,121
it's bad for your brain because what 
they do is they get people high who've 

2414
01:52:45,121 --> 01:52:48,241
never been high and then they give them 
a bunch of math questions and they have 

2415
01:52:48,241 --> 01:52:48,800
trouble.
I can answer them whenever he's like,

2416
01:52:48,920 --> 01:52:51,470
I've been high,
I don't want to do math when I'm high,

2417
01:52:51,650 --> 01:52:54,440
so let's test people on things they like
doing when they're high,

2418
01:52:54,470 --> 01:52:59,470
like color perception or pattern 
recognition or ability to recognize 

2419
01:53:00,530 --> 01:53:03,050
tonal changes in music,
things like that.

2420
01:53:03,230 --> 01:53:05,900
And he found that their perceptions were
actually heightened.

2421
01:53:06,470 --> 01:53:07,280
So it's like,
ah,

2422
01:53:07,281 --> 01:53:08,900
see,
marijuana is not bad.

2423
01:53:08,901 --> 01:53:11,750
It's just bad for certain things and not
others.

2424
01:53:11,990 --> 01:53:13,340
So then he did,
um,

2425
01:53:14,070 --> 01:53:16,610
I think it was about driving.
We said,

2426
01:53:16,611 --> 01:53:19,220
okay,
they find that marijuana impacts impairs

2427
01:53:19,221 --> 01:53:20,780
driving ability,
but that's again,

2428
01:53:20,781 --> 01:53:25,781
because they're using naive people 
who've never been high before and they 

2429
01:53:25,781 --> 01:53:27,680
don't have a chance to practice driving 
while high.

2430
01:53:28,070 --> 01:53:32,150
So he got people let them practice,
let them get used to being high.

2431
01:53:32,151 --> 01:53:37,151
Then he tested their driving ability 
versus what it had been before or when 

2432
01:53:37,151 --> 01:53:39,410
they're not stone and average scores and
all that,

2433
01:53:39,411 --> 01:53:44,411
and he again,
he found that when people had a chance 

2434
01:53:44,411 --> 01:53:44,411
to practice,
they drove fine.

2435
01:53:44,411 --> 01:53:48,570
There's no problem.
He got basically pushed out because he 

2436
01:53:48,570 --> 01:53:48,570
was finding,
you know,

2437
01:53:48,570 --> 01:53:51,740
he was demonstrating that it's not 
necessarily a bad thing.

2438
01:53:51,890 --> 01:53:56,890
Yeah.
It's one of those things that we talked 

2439
01:53:56,890 --> 01:53:58,931
about before.
Sometimes people don't want to know the 

2440
01:53:58,931 --> 01:54:02,141
actual results.
They just want to know the results that 

2441
01:54:02,141 --> 01:54:04,781
jive with their understanding of this is
really dangerous in science because 

2442
01:54:04,781 --> 01:54:08,960
people are purporting to be objective 
and sign off and they're not.

2443
01:54:09,110 --> 01:54:14,110
And it's not fair.
It's not fair to all the people that 

2444
01:54:14,110 --> 01:54:16,901
were unjustly arrested and prosecuted 
and imprisoned for something that's very

2445
01:54:17,571 --> 01:54:22,571
beneficial.
And they were saying a lot of them 

2446
01:54:22,571 --> 01:54:25,060
saying that they like it,
saying that it does good things for 

2447
01:54:25,060 --> 01:54:25,060
them.
You know,

2448
01:54:25,060 --> 01:54:26,900
it's not the end all cure all,
but there's not a goddamn thing it is,

2449
01:54:27,230 --> 01:54:28,950
but it's certainly a tool.
Right.

2450
01:54:28,990 --> 01:54:30,630
And look at it objectively,
what,

2451
01:54:30,740 --> 01:54:34,030
what's the ratio of benefit to danger?
Right.

2452
01:54:34,070 --> 01:54:35,960
You know,
how many people have died from marijuana

2453
01:54:35,961 --> 01:54:37,820
overdose?
Zero ever.

2454
01:54:37,850 --> 01:54:42,850
Right?
And so Andy Wilde has been saying this 

2455
01:54:42,850 --> 01:54:44,600
since the seventies and his first book 
is called the natural mind that he wrote

2456
01:54:44,601 --> 01:54:49,601
the marriage of the sun and the moon 
than a book called from chocolate to 

2457
01:54:49,601 --> 01:54:49,601
morphine.

2458
01:54:49,601 --> 01:54:52,520
These are all big stretch,
but chocolate is a drug,

2459
01:54:52,521 --> 01:54:52,850
right?
Yeah,

2460
01:54:52,860 --> 01:54:53,420
right.
Yeah.

2461
01:54:53,690 --> 01:54:58,690
Yeah.
And the marriage of the sun and the 

2462
01:54:58,690 --> 01:55:00,131
moon.
Each chapter is about a mind altering 

2463
01:55:00,131 --> 01:55:00,770
substance or experienced.
So vomiting is one chapter in there.

2464
01:55:01,190 --> 01:55:02,780
Cocaine,
mushrooms.

2465
01:55:03,020 --> 01:55:05,820
So he and Paul stamets had been buddies 
for 35 years.

2466
01:55:05,821 --> 01:55:10,821
There's,
does that have anything to do with 

2467
01:55:10,821 --> 01:55:12,011
bulemia?
Does bulemia also like something where 

2468
01:55:12,011 --> 01:55:12,011
people are getting addicted to actual 
throwing up?

2469
01:55:12,170 --> 01:55:17,170
Yeah.
And there are religions where people 

2470
01:55:17,170 --> 01:55:17,630
vomit every morning in India.
I think Gandhi vomited every morning.

2471
01:55:17,780 --> 01:55:20,440
Jesus Gandhi and he drank his own pissed
by the way.

2472
01:55:20,630 --> 01:55:21,690
Way to go.
Yeah.

2473
01:55:22,130 --> 01:55:27,130
So anyway,
Andy Weil is this kind of hippie doctor 

2474
01:55:27,130 --> 01:55:30,230
dude with all the drugs and all that,
and the big white beard.

2475
01:55:30,560 --> 01:55:32,120
And then he,
um,

2476
01:55:32,930 --> 01:55:37,930
he became very famous in the eighties 
with books about alternative medicine,

2477
01:55:39,110 --> 01:55:44,110
but he goes complimentary medicine 
because he's not saying Western 

2478
01:55:44,110 --> 01:55:44,130
medicine's bad,
he's

2479
01:55:44,130 --> 01:55:47,910
saying it's good for some things,
not the best approach to other things.

2480
01:55:48,020 --> 01:55:52,710
So he brings in Ayervetic and Chinese 
and all these different traditions,

2481
01:55:52,711 --> 01:55:56,310
depending on what the issue is.
He became very mainstream,

2482
01:55:56,311 --> 01:56:00,960
huge mega bestsellers on Oprah cover of 
Time magazine,

2483
01:56:01,050 --> 01:56:05,340
you know,
he started a school at the University of

2484
01:56:05,340 --> 01:56:09,600
Arizona for doctors to get a 
certification in complimentary medicine.

2485
01:56:09,601 --> 01:56:12,120
So He's super mainstream,
successful,

2486
01:56:12,390 --> 01:56:17,390
but he has never wavered on his stance 
on drugs.

2487
01:56:18,930 --> 01:56:22,420
And so imagine the pressures that were 
coming on them believable.

2488
01:56:22,440 --> 01:56:23,120
And he's like,
no,

2489
01:56:23,121 --> 01:56:25,500
fuck it.
The seventies and the eighties.

2490
01:56:25,830 --> 01:56:30,830
All that say no to drugs era.
Here's a question that you'd probably 

2491
01:56:30,830 --> 01:56:30,920
know the answer to.
Um,

2492
01:56:31,200 --> 01:56:36,200
there are obviously killing untold 
numbers of rhinos for their horns 

2493
01:56:36,511 --> 01:56:39,720
because men want to grind them up and 
it's supposed to get your dick hard.

2494
01:56:40,200 --> 01:56:45,200
Does that work for me?
Did you try it and have it out there 

2495
01:56:46,051 --> 01:56:48,100
killing rhinos on the snake pit forever?

2496
01:56:48,440 --> 01:56:50,970
You know,
is there any science to that?

2497
01:56:51,780 --> 01:56:53,460
No,
not that I'm aware of.

2498
01:56:53,461 --> 01:56:57,210
That is the craziest genocide ever.
And who's doing it?

2499
01:56:57,211 --> 01:57:00,330
It's not Africans who think it's gonna 
make their dicks hard.

2500
01:57:00,360 --> 01:57:05,360
It's Chinese.
It's Asian people that apparently have 

2501
01:57:05,360 --> 01:57:09,750
a.
What I was told is that it's not even 

2502
01:57:09,750 --> 01:57:12,210
necessarily just about the idea that it 
gets your dick hard,

2503
01:57:12,270 --> 01:57:17,270
but there is value in the fact that it's
a forbidden thing that's very difficult 

2504
01:57:17,270 --> 01:57:17,610
to acquire.
I think that's.

2505
01:57:17,611 --> 01:57:21,420
I think it's a signaling.
It's like a Rolex watch or a Lamborghini

2506
01:57:21,421 --> 01:57:26,421
or whatever.
It's like what my friend told me it was 

2507
01:57:26,421 --> 01:57:26,421
that it's not just a signaling,
but it's a signaling that you don't give

2508
01:57:26,421 --> 01:57:27,350
a fuck.
Like you're,

2509
01:57:27,360 --> 01:57:31,590
you're here to make money and get the 
best and have the best things.

2510
01:57:31,591 --> 01:57:33,780
And look what's,
let's drink rhino t and then we're gonna

2511
01:57:33,790 --> 01:57:34,920
eat shark fin soup.

2512
01:57:35,100 --> 01:57:37,860
Ha can live.
Monkey brain.

2513
01:57:38,290 --> 01:57:39,720
Have you seen that?
I've seen that.

2514
01:57:40,170 --> 01:57:42,210
That's really intense.
That's real.

2515
01:57:42,330 --> 01:57:45,510
I've sought in um,
a faces of death.

2516
01:57:46,080 --> 01:57:51,080
A bunch of people sitting around there 
whacking a monkey in the head with a 

2517
01:57:51,080 --> 01:57:51,080
hammer and his head stuck in this little
thing,

2518
01:57:51,080 --> 01:57:51,210
but I was in the table.
Yeah.

2519
01:57:51,211 --> 01:57:54,120
I wasn't really sure if that was real 
and they scoop it out.

2520
01:57:54,121 --> 01:57:55,170
And you didn't.
Yeah.

2521
01:57:55,230 --> 01:57:58,950
Rattlesnake brains though,
isn't that like prions?

2522
01:57:58,951 --> 01:58:02,490
Can you get prions from primate brains?
Like you can.

2523
01:58:02,580 --> 01:58:05,240
You could be deathly ill from that.
Right?

2524
01:58:05,840 --> 01:58:08,430
Like that's essentially what mad cow 
diseases.

2525
01:58:08,450 --> 01:58:09,560
Yeah.
Yeah.

2526
01:58:10,470 --> 01:58:11,980
From brains.
Chow,

2527
01:58:12,100 --> 01:58:13,560
forcing cows,
eat cows.

2528
01:58:13,561 --> 01:58:18,561
That's where mad cow disease comes from,
which is a body mind couldn't give blood

2529
01:58:19,140 --> 01:58:21,390
because he was in England.
He lived in England during the time that

2530
01:58:21,391 --> 01:58:23,250
the mad cow.
I was in Spain then.

2531
01:58:23,620 --> 01:58:28,620
Yeah.
I can't give blood because of the 

2532
01:58:28,620 --> 01:58:28,620
hepatitis A.
Which one did you get?

2533
01:58:28,620 --> 01:58:28,620
A,
B or c?

2534
01:58:29,130 --> 01:58:30,240
A.
Is that a good one?

2535
01:58:30,300 --> 01:58:30,930
Yeah,
that's the,

2536
01:58:30,960 --> 01:58:34,020
that's the one is easy one.
Oh yeah.

2537
01:58:34,080 --> 01:58:39,080
It was like a month down yellow eyes,
like no energy a month.

2538
01:58:41,290 --> 01:58:41,800
That was,

2539
01:58:42,160 --> 01:58:42,910
yeah.
That,

2540
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:44,050
uh,
that's a long story,

2541
01:58:44,051 --> 01:58:49,051
but that,
that I actually got it from a guy who 

2542
01:58:49,051 --> 01:58:51,050
was sort of saving me from something 
else that I,

2543
01:58:51,390 --> 01:58:54,190
they never told you the whole Scorpion 
and Guatemala story.

2544
01:58:54,610 --> 01:58:55,780
I think he did.
But tell me again.

2545
01:58:55,781 --> 01:58:56,920
Well,
it's a long story.

2546
01:58:57,660 --> 01:58:58,720
Yeah.
I mean,

2547
01:58:59,290 --> 01:59:04,290
I don't know though.
People will be well feel like they're 

2548
01:59:04,290 --> 01:59:04,290
getting now people can hear it.
I,

2549
01:59:04,290 --> 01:59:05,170
I've told her it on my podcast and I've 
also,

2550
01:59:05,171 --> 01:59:09,130
I told her it on a podcast called risk 
and that's actually cliff notes.

2551
01:59:09,420 --> 01:59:10,960
Uh,
yeah,

2552
01:59:10,961 --> 01:59:15,961
but listen to the risk thing,
if anyone wants to hear the whole thing 

2553
01:59:15,961 --> 01:59:15,961
because they added sound effects and 
it's really good.

2554
01:59:15,961 --> 01:59:17,000
What is risk?
It's a,

2555
01:59:17,001 --> 01:59:20,800
it's a podcast or just,
it's a storytelling thing,

2556
01:59:20,820 --> 01:59:22,120
you know,
it's like the moth,

2557
01:59:22,121 --> 01:59:24,880
it's that kind of thing.
And they added sound effects.

2558
01:59:24,930 --> 01:59:26,530
Yeah.
They produced it really well.

2559
01:59:26,531 --> 01:59:27,590
Yeah.
As well to.

2560
01:59:28,270 --> 01:59:29,530
Yeah.
What happened was I was,

2561
01:59:29,590 --> 01:59:32,020
I was with my girlfriend at the time,
Puerto Rican,

2562
01:59:32,110 --> 01:59:35,710
super beautiful Puerto Rican girl,
and she tried to get you to go to a camp

2563
01:59:35,711 --> 01:59:40,711
away and talk about Jesus or no,
she never tried to talk to me about 

2564
01:59:40,711 --> 01:59:44,041
Jesus,
but I would have listened because she 

2565
01:59:44,041 --> 01:59:44,041
was interested in how the APP.
No,

2566
01:59:44,041 --> 01:59:44,500
she was great.
Um,

2567
01:59:45,310 --> 01:59:50,310
so I was with her in Guatemala and uh,
we had met this other couple,

2568
01:59:52,360 --> 01:59:57,360
solange and Fabrizio and um,
yeah,

2569
01:59:59,021 --> 02:00:03,480
we were at this place called t carl in 
North East Guatemala,

2570
02:00:03,481 --> 02:00:08,481
way,
way back in the jungle and it's a mayan 

2571
02:00:08,481 --> 02:00:08,481
ruins,
beautiful,

2572
02:00:08,800 --> 02:00:09,730
crazy,
you know,

2573
02:00:09,731 --> 02:00:12,140
it was like a big city and now they're,
you know,

2574
02:00:12,730 --> 02:00:14,410
when I was there,
this was 1989,

2575
02:00:14,411 --> 02:00:18,700
there were maybe 10 big ruins,
big temples that they had uncovered.

2576
02:00:19,270 --> 02:00:22,240
And we're staying in this campsite with 
hammocks.

2577
02:00:22,241 --> 02:00:24,850
It was very primitive at the time.
Anyway,

2578
02:00:24,940 --> 02:00:26,410
uh,
we,

2579
02:00:26,411 --> 02:00:30,460
it was a full moon and on,
and I decided we were going to take some

2580
02:00:30,461 --> 02:00:35,461
acid and watch the moon rise and the sun
set up from the top of symbol for,

2581
02:00:37,480 --> 02:00:41,980
it's called the Jaguar temple.
And so we went up with this other couple

2582
02:00:42,310 --> 02:00:45,430
and there's this ledge up there and it's
up above tree line,

2583
02:00:45,431 --> 02:00:46,690
you know,
you're way above the tree line.

2584
02:00:46,691 --> 02:00:48,820
You can see the monkeys,
the monkeys and,

2585
02:00:49,420 --> 02:00:53,090
and like see out over this flat jungle 
Putin,

2586
02:00:53,110 --> 02:00:55,260
I think it's called.
And um,

2587
02:00:55,330 --> 02:01:00,330
so we're up there and the sun's sinking 
and the moon is rising and the moon 

2588
02:01:01,511 --> 02:01:03,160
comes up.
It's beautiful.

2589
02:01:03,161 --> 02:01:08,161
And,
and there's this big bank of storm 

2590
02:01:08,161 --> 02:01:11,020
clouds and the full moon is like between
the horizon and the storm clouds.

2591
02:01:11,020 --> 02:01:14,620
But then it starts to go up behind these
clouds and you can see it's going to get

2592
02:01:14,650 --> 02:01:15,910
dark as fuck.
Right?

2593
02:01:15,911 --> 02:01:17,380
So this other couple were like,
yeah,

2594
02:01:17,381 --> 02:01:20,140
we're going to go back to the campsite.
They didn't know we were tripping.

2595
02:01:20,200 --> 02:01:21,580
Right.
And we timed it.

2596
02:01:21,581 --> 02:01:26,581
So we were peeking like now you know,
and so they're going to go back to the 

2597
02:01:26,711 --> 02:01:28,430
campsite.
So we,

2598
02:01:28,440 --> 02:01:29,380
but we were like,
yeah,

2599
02:01:29,381 --> 02:01:30,940
we're gonna just hang here.
Right.

2600
02:01:30,941 --> 02:01:35,941
So I went over to hold the flashlight 
for them as they went down this ladder 

2601
02:01:35,941 --> 02:01:39,770
and was like maybe a 30 foot ladder pipe
ladder drilled into the temples,

2602
02:01:39,771 --> 02:01:40,070
made out

2603
02:01:40,070 --> 02:01:42,830
of limestone blocks.
And so to get up there.

2604
02:01:42,860 --> 02:01:43,520
Yeah,
there you go.

2605
02:01:43,880 --> 02:01:46,310
Before.
So we're at steep.

2606
02:01:47,580 --> 02:01:50,450
Yeah.
Is that climbed up at temple for though?

2607
02:01:51,190 --> 02:01:52,190
I mean,
uh,

2608
02:01:52,320 --> 02:01:54,640
the,
the Jaguar temple.

2609
02:01:55,210 --> 02:01:56,640
I typed in temple for Jaguar.
Oh,

2610
02:01:56,650 --> 02:01:57,470
okay.
Cool.

2611
02:01:57,680 --> 02:01:58,850
Yeah,
yeah.

2612
02:01:58,851 --> 02:02:01,100
When I was there was much more 
overgrown.

2613
02:02:02,090 --> 02:02:03,560
Yeah.
Anyway,

2614
02:02:03,561 --> 02:02:05,580
so we,
we went up to the top of that.

2615
02:02:05,610 --> 02:02:07,640
Looks like if they're on the right.
Yeah,

2616
02:02:07,641 --> 02:02:10,460
that looks like it from like when we 
were there anyway.

2617
02:02:10,461 --> 02:02:15,461
So we're up on that ledge there and,
and see how flat the jungle is.

2618
02:02:15,870 --> 02:02:20,870
Just goes forever.
It's so crazy how it's almost like 

2619
02:02:20,870 --> 02:02:21,770
uniform and height.
Yeah.

2620
02:02:22,140 --> 02:02:23,870
I mean just very,
very little bit,

2621
02:02:23,871 --> 02:02:25,520
but.
Oh look at that picture.

2622
02:02:25,550 --> 02:02:27,380
Yeah.
Yeah.

2623
02:02:27,440 --> 02:02:32,440
Oh Man.
It looks like a picture I took actually 

2624
02:02:32,440 --> 02:02:32,570
up there.
Anyway,

2625
02:02:32,571 --> 02:02:34,940
so looking.
It's so beautiful.

2626
02:02:35,150 --> 02:02:40,150
So we're up there and uh,
and I'm holding the ladder for these 

2627
02:02:40,221 --> 02:02:42,890
guys going down and they're like,
okay,

2628
02:02:42,891 --> 02:02:43,310
we're good.

2629
02:02:43,310 --> 02:02:43,820
I'm like,
okay.

2630
02:02:43,821 --> 02:02:46,850
I turned off the ladder and I take a 
step and fuck.

2631
02:02:46,910 --> 02:02:48,140
Oh,
what the fuck was that?

2632
02:02:48,440 --> 02:02:51,440
I turned the flashlight back on.
See the Scorpion going up the wall,

2633
02:02:51,441 --> 02:02:55,610
stirring up the wall like four inches 
green,

2634
02:02:55,940 --> 02:02:58,490
and then they're like three other ones 
on the wall and say,

2635
02:02:58,510 --> 02:03:01,460
fuck this things crawling with fucking 
scorpions.

2636
02:03:01,820 --> 02:03:06,820
And I just got stung on the toe while 
you're on acid while I'm tripit and 

2637
02:03:06,820 --> 02:03:09,580
thank God I didn't jump because I would 
have dropped 30 feet to fucking rocks.

2638
02:03:09,630 --> 02:03:14,630
Oh my gosh.
So I go back to Anna and she said,

2639
02:03:16,100 --> 02:03:16,940
what happened to you?
I said,

2640
02:03:16,941 --> 02:03:18,470
I just fucking Scorpion.
Like,

2641
02:03:18,471 --> 02:03:19,330
watch out.
And like,

2642
02:03:19,340 --> 02:03:20,120
oh,
Jesus,

2643
02:03:20,121 --> 02:03:21,200
right?
Oh my God.

2644
02:03:21,650 --> 02:03:22,880
So we're kind of like,
oh,

2645
02:03:22,881 --> 02:03:24,170
are they dangerous?
I don't know.

2646
02:03:24,180 --> 02:03:25,960
I don't know.
I don't know.

2647
02:03:26,540 --> 02:03:29,600
So I'm now it's getting dark,
right?

2648
02:03:29,600 --> 02:03:34,280
Because the moon's going behind these 
clouds and there's this other,

2649
02:03:34,281 --> 02:03:39,281
these two dudes like way over on the 
other side of the ledge and we go over 

2650
02:03:39,281 --> 02:03:42,680
to them and they're Italian and they 
don't speak English,

2651
02:03:42,681 --> 02:03:47,681
but he spoke Spanish,
so she was talking to them in Spanish 

2652
02:03:47,681 --> 02:03:49,100
and Italian and you sort of understand,
you know,

2653
02:03:49,460 --> 02:03:54,460
they're both Latin,
similar languages and those guys are 

2654
02:03:54,460 --> 02:03:54,460
like,
ah,

2655
02:03:54,460 --> 02:03:54,460
I don't know.
And we were like,

2656
02:03:54,460 --> 02:03:55,550
watch out because they're all around 
like,

2657
02:03:55,551 --> 02:03:56,240
oh shit.
Yeah.

2658
02:03:56,690 --> 02:03:59,870
So while we're talking to them now it's 
totally dark.

2659
02:03:59,900 --> 02:04:04,900
This Guatemalan dude comes up the ladder
with an old bolt action rifle and he's 

2660
02:04:05,031 --> 02:04:10,031
like the night guard or something.
So we go over to him and honest as to 

2661
02:04:10,031 --> 02:04:14,291
him in Spanish is in some Scorpio and 
they got,

2662
02:04:15,890 --> 02:04:18,900
are they dangerous?
The Scorpions and the guy says csun like

2663
02:04:18,960 --> 02:04:20,470
Dolly's,
I'm worth those.

2664
02:04:21,150 --> 02:04:22,700
They're lethal.
There are deaths.

2665
02:04:24,040 --> 02:04:24,600
Like,
ah,

2666
02:04:24,740 --> 02:04:27,470
fuck man,
I understood enough Spanish to get that.

2667
02:04:27,471 --> 02:04:29,240
You're thinking you're dying.
So I'm like,

2668
02:04:30,340 --> 02:04:31,280
this.
Is it?

2669
02:04:32,540 --> 02:04:35,180
April,
full moon of April 1989.

2670
02:04:35,470 --> 02:04:36,510
Yeah,
I was 27.

2671
02:04:36,511 --> 02:04:38,100
It was right around time of trump's 
plane

2672
02:04:38,100 --> 02:04:40,650
crashed.
What if it was exactly the same?

2673
02:04:40,720 --> 02:04:44,460
I think.
Talk about being curious in your life.

2674
02:04:44,830 --> 02:04:45,650
Yeah.
Yeah.

2675
02:04:45,690 --> 02:04:50,690
I was at a table that Puerto Rican girl 
while you were would that other Puerto 

2676
02:04:50,690 --> 02:04:52,090
Rican girl up there?
Puerto Rican girls crossed our paths.

2677
02:04:53,030 --> 02:04:55,050
Both survived.
She was barely.

2678
02:04:55,051 --> 02:04:59,400
So what happened to you?
So I'm thinking like,

2679
02:05:00,300 --> 02:05:05,300
fuck,
I gotta get down from here because 

2680
02:05:05,300 --> 02:05:07,521
there's no way anyone else could carry 
me down these ladders and you couldn't 

2681
02:05:07,521 --> 02:05:07,560
get a stretcher down.
Right?

2682
02:05:07,590 --> 02:05:12,000
So if I'm going to survive,
I got to get down on my own quickly.

2683
02:05:12,001 --> 02:05:14,670
So then if I collapse they can get an 
ambulance.

2684
02:05:14,970 --> 02:05:16,620
Although we're like,
you know,

2685
02:05:16,680 --> 02:05:20,280
two days from Guatemala City and 
whatever the town was,

2686
02:05:20,281 --> 02:05:22,680
I don't even know if they had a clinic 
or I don't know,

2687
02:05:22,681 --> 02:05:27,681
but we were pretty remote and I'm like,
they're not going to send out a 

2688
02:05:27,681 --> 02:05:28,740
helicopter or some shit like that.

2689
02:05:28,740 --> 02:05:30,150
Right.
So,

2690
02:05:30,151 --> 02:05:32,280
uh,
I get down.

2691
02:05:32,610 --> 02:05:33,030
I.
Oh,

2692
02:05:33,031 --> 02:05:35,250
so what happens is my girlfriend's 
freaking out.

2693
02:05:36,670 --> 02:05:39,000
No,
no criticism of her.

2694
02:05:39,001 --> 02:05:44,001
I think it's much harder to watch 
someone you love die than to die 

2695
02:05:44,001 --> 02:05:45,930
yourself and in this case.
And so she's like,

2696
02:05:45,931 --> 02:05:47,190
Oh fuck,
you're dying.

2697
02:05:47,191 --> 02:05:48,340
And I'm thinking,
Gee,

2698
02:05:48,341 --> 02:05:49,170
uh,
maybe.

2699
02:05:49,171 --> 02:05:52,500
And so the one of the Italian dudes was 
like,

2700
02:05:52,620 --> 02:05:53,610
look,
you guys go,

2701
02:05:53,611 --> 02:05:56,730
I'll stay with her and you know,
make sure she's all right.

2702
02:05:56,731 --> 02:05:58,950
And so I go down with his other Italian 
dude.

2703
02:05:58,951 --> 02:06:03,951
We go down the ladder and we get down to
the floor and we start walking around 

2704
02:06:03,951 --> 02:06:07,980
the jungle and it's fucking totally dark
now because the moon's totally obscured.

2705
02:06:08,560 --> 02:06:09,780
And the jungle,
you know,

2706
02:06:09,781 --> 02:06:10,620
when you're tripping,
you're,

2707
02:06:10,650 --> 02:06:15,650
your pupils are super dilated so you can
see light and stuff that normally you 

2708
02:06:15,650 --> 02:06:17,940
might miss.
Like the jungle in Guatemala was full of

2709
02:06:17,941 --> 02:06:21,950
glowing worms and shit flying by.

2710
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:24,390
It's all like green and blue and.
Yeah.

2711
02:06:24,391 --> 02:06:29,391
Yeah.
And they're like these caterpillars and 

2712
02:06:29,391 --> 02:06:29,391
like,
Holy Shit,

2713
02:06:29,391 --> 02:06:30,120
this place is wild.
So we're walking around,

2714
02:06:30,360 --> 02:06:32,820
lost.
Totally dark tripping.

2715
02:06:33,270 --> 02:06:34,920
I'm tripping.
He doesn't know.

2716
02:06:34,921 --> 02:06:36,280
I'm tripping.
How,

2717
02:06:36,360 --> 02:06:41,340
how trip and are you tripping?
That was three head nods,

2718
02:06:41,341 --> 02:06:43,950
ladies and gentlemen.
I mean,

2719
02:06:44,320 --> 02:06:49,320
you know,
I'm peeking from the acid plus all the 

2720
02:06:49,320 --> 02:06:49,320
adrenaline,
right?

2721
02:06:49,320 --> 02:06:53,880
And so this pain is running up my leg 
and as it's like running up my,

2722
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:57,420
the bone in the center of the leg,
just kind of fire.

2723
02:06:57,720 --> 02:07:01,160
And when it gets to the top of muscles,
seize up,

2724
02:07:01,820 --> 02:07:03,930
you know,
my from the knee down,

2725
02:07:03,931 --> 02:07:08,931
it's just like rigid.
And then my tongue starts swelling and 

2726
02:07:08,971 --> 02:07:13,971
my throat starts swelling.
And I got this like novacane feeling in 

2727
02:07:13,971 --> 02:07:17,481
my lips and I'm sort of drooling and um,
and I'm thinking when this gets to my 

2728
02:07:19,141 --> 02:07:20,970
heart,
that's when I die.

2729
02:07:21,750 --> 02:07:25,380
And so I'm,
I'm with this guy and we're lost.

2730
02:07:25,381 --> 02:07:28,890
And,
and at first like I'm freaked,

2731
02:07:28,891 --> 02:07:33,891
I'm scared and then it occurs to me that
I'm saying my last words to a guy whose 

2732
02:07:39,341 --> 02:07:44,341
face I've never seen because we didn't 
shine the light in his face when we're 

2733
02:07:44,341 --> 02:07:47,950
talking to him and he doesn't understand
English.

2734
02:07:48,730 --> 02:07:53,730
And that cracks me up that I just,
I start laughing like a fucking maniac 

2735
02:07:54,310 --> 02:07:55,960
and he's like,
got his arm around me.

2736
02:07:55,961 --> 02:07:58,210
He thinks I'm like losing it.
And I'm just like,

2737
02:07:58,211 --> 02:08:03,211
this is hilarious.
And I think about my friends and how 

2738
02:08:03,211 --> 02:08:04,510
they're going to be like,
yeah,

2739
02:08:04,710 --> 02:08:06,100
you know,
good on Chris,

2740
02:08:06,130 --> 02:08:06,750
you know,
he,

2741
02:08:06,770 --> 02:08:10,370
he didn't die in some dumb ass way.
Like we all thought he would get.

2742
02:08:10,630 --> 02:08:12,700
He died in this.
It's still a dumb ass way,

2743
02:08:12,701 --> 02:08:15,250
but at least it's interesting.
And then I started thinking,

2744
02:08:15,251 --> 02:08:15,970
you know,
all right,

2745
02:08:15,971 --> 02:08:19,600
I'm 27,
but I've been around the world.

2746
02:08:20,040 --> 02:08:24,070
I literally around the planet,
I've been in love.

2747
02:08:24,430 --> 02:08:28,720
I've had sex with gorgeous women who 
loved me,

2748
02:08:28,750 --> 02:08:29,660
who,
you know,

2749
02:08:29,700 --> 02:08:30,970
I've,
Wa,

2750
02:08:31,150 --> 02:08:33,550
I,
I made a shit ton of money.

2751
02:08:33,850 --> 02:08:36,190
I walked away from it.
I,

2752
02:08:36,340 --> 02:08:40,120
I've done,
I've done everything I wanted to do.

2753
02:08:40,870 --> 02:08:45,870
I'm 27,
but I've done everything and I've had a 

2754
02:08:45,870 --> 02:08:47,140
fucking amazing life.
Wow.

2755
02:08:47,710 --> 02:08:50,560
And this is cool.
I would have been crying like a bitch,

2756
02:08:51,400 --> 02:08:52,170
I believe.
No,

2757
02:08:53,390 --> 02:08:56,620
you know,
I felt really bad for my parents and,

2758
02:08:56,640 --> 02:08:58,900
and Ana.
But for myself,

2759
02:08:58,901 --> 02:09:01,930
I was like,
I've had a good fucking run.

2760
02:09:02,350 --> 02:09:05,650
It's not as long as I would've liked,
but I've had a good fucking run.

2761
02:09:06,100 --> 02:09:11,100
So I really came to this piece and like,
the world doesn't owe me shit,

2762
02:09:14,711 --> 02:09:15,910
man.
I've had.

2763
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:18,610
I mean,
I had been in Alaska two summers at that

2764
02:09:18,611 --> 02:09:23,611
point.
I worked in New York in Manhattan for 

2765
02:09:23,611 --> 02:09:26,311
two years at that point with a guy who 
offered me a million dollars if I would 

2766
02:09:26,311 --> 02:09:26,311
stay.

2767
02:09:26,311 --> 02:09:27,400
And I said No.
And I left.

2768
02:09:27,810 --> 02:09:30,850
I flew to India.
I had been in Asia for two years.

2769
02:09:30,940 --> 02:09:34,270
You've said no to a million bucks when I
was 26.

2770
02:09:34,330 --> 02:09:39,330
Why did you say no to the million bucks?
What was the catch was you need to do 

2771
02:09:39,330 --> 02:09:39,460
to,
you know,

2772
02:09:39,461 --> 02:09:41,480
he was a really good guy actually.
Uh,

2773
02:09:41,610 --> 02:09:45,760
I liked him a lot.
The million bucks was,

2774
02:09:46,030 --> 02:09:51,030
he said when you're 30 you'll have a net
worth of a million dollars and if you 

2775
02:09:51,030 --> 02:09:54,931
don't,
I'll write you a check for the whatever 

2776
02:09:54,931 --> 02:09:57,140
you're missing and we'll notarize it and
this guy's worth $30,000,000

2777
02:09:57,160 --> 02:09:59,650
or something.
So he just wanted you to work for him.

2778
02:09:59,740 --> 02:10:04,740
He wanted me to stay and I wanted to go.
I wanted to see the world and this guy 

2779
02:10:04,740 --> 02:10:09,391
hired me to help him manage his family's
property in midtown Manhattan and the 

2780
02:10:10,961 --> 02:10:13,660
main reason he hired me is because I 
didn't give a shit about money,

2781
02:10:14,290 --> 02:10:16,430
so he knew I wouldn't steal from him.
Ah,

2782
02:10:16,530 --> 02:10:21,530
that's interesting.
And then when it stopped being fun and 

2783
02:10:21,530 --> 02:10:21,610
knew,
I was like,

2784
02:10:21,790 --> 02:10:23,050
I got to go.
He's like,

2785
02:10:23,080 --> 02:10:23,560
no,
no,

2786
02:10:23,590 --> 02:10:25,360
stick around.
I'll make it worth your while.

2787
02:10:25,361 --> 02:10:28,810
And so there was this weird dynamic.
But anyway,

2788
02:10:28,811 --> 02:10:32,190
I had all these experiences and so I 
would wear a piece.

2789
02:10:32,200 --> 02:10:32,970
I like,
Hey,

2790
02:10:33,020 --> 02:10:34,100
I've had a good run.
So

2791
02:10:34,190 --> 02:10:35,300
anyway,
we finally,

2792
02:10:35,301 --> 02:10:37,340
we,
we come out into this little parking lot

2793
02:10:37,580 --> 02:10:42,580
and there's this Guatemalan kid there 
maybe 10 or something and the Italian 

2794
02:10:42,580 --> 02:10:42,740
guy talks to him and says,
Scorpion,

2795
02:10:42,741 --> 02:10:44,090
Scorpion.
And the kid looks at me like,

2796
02:10:44,091 --> 02:10:45,110
oh my God,
come,

2797
02:10:45,111 --> 02:10:50,111
come.
And he takes us to this trailer and we 

2798
02:10:50,111 --> 02:10:52,670
bang on the door and this horrible 
fluorescent light comes on.

2799
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:58,000
And this like Guatemalan Dude who 
obviously had been drunk and asleep,

2800
02:10:58,760 --> 02:11:03,760
you know,
it was like the kid says he's the 

2801
02:11:03,760 --> 02:11:03,760
doctor.
He's not a doctor.

2802
02:11:03,760 --> 02:11:04,460
He's some jungle dude,
whatever,

2803
02:11:04,970 --> 02:11:08,990
and the,
so the guy takes us in and he's talking,

2804
02:11:09,410 --> 02:11:10,820
you know,
it's sort of Saki,

2805
02:11:10,821 --> 02:11:12,710
broken English,
and I explained to him,

2806
02:11:12,711 --> 02:11:14,060
he says,
how big is the Scorpion?

2807
02:11:14,061 --> 02:11:15,050
He looks at my foot.
He says,

2808
02:11:15,051 --> 02:11:16,350
how big was the Scorpion?
I say,

2809
02:11:16,351 --> 02:11:17,840
yeah,
like this big,

2810
02:11:17,870 --> 02:11:19,840
like a finger and what color?

2811
02:11:19,870 --> 02:11:21,350
Gray,
green sort of.

2812
02:11:21,710 --> 02:11:22,700
And he says,
ah,

2813
02:11:22,701 --> 02:11:23,040
yeah,
yeah,

2814
02:11:23,050 --> 02:11:24,440
yeah.
That's not a scorpion.

2815
02:11:24,770 --> 02:11:29,770
That's electron.
So in Spanish and that part of 

2816
02:11:29,770 --> 02:11:29,770
Guatemala.
Anyway,

2817
02:11:29,770 --> 02:11:33,800
they're two different words.
A squat beyond is a little red thing.

2818
02:11:34,820 --> 02:11:39,820
Electron is a big green thing,
but they're both with the tail and the,

2819
02:11:39,920 --> 02:11:42,080
you know.
And uh,

2820
02:11:42,320 --> 02:11:45,890
so we had been using the word Scorpion 
because in English that's all there is.

2821
02:11:46,340 --> 02:11:51,340
But Scorpion,
Scorpion in that part of Guatemala is 

2822
02:11:51,340 --> 02:11:55,541
lethal and that's a little tiny thing.
That's a little red thing and that'll 

2823
02:11:55,541 --> 02:11:57,080
fucking take you out.
But the guys like,

2824
02:11:57,081 --> 02:11:57,800
look,
you're still,

2825
02:11:57,801 --> 02:12:00,140
this was two hours ago and you're still 
alive.

2826
02:12:00,141 --> 02:12:05,141
You'll be fine.
Apparently it's like if you have a bad 

2827
02:12:05,141 --> 02:12:06,230
heart or you're a kid,
maybe this will kill you.

2828
02:12:06,231 --> 02:12:09,050
But if you're,
if you survive a couple hours,

2829
02:12:09,051 --> 02:12:11,840
you're going to be speaking to something
I've read today.

2830
02:12:12,170 --> 02:12:16,070
Something about the Atkins Guy.
This is an interesting story.

2831
02:12:16,460 --> 02:12:17,900
You know,
the Atkins Diet.

2832
02:12:18,380 --> 02:12:23,120
It's very controversial because diet is 
a lot of protein stuff.

2833
02:12:23,370 --> 02:12:26,870
Um,
I had heard that the guy died of a heart

2834
02:12:26,871 --> 02:12:31,871
attack and that they weren't being 
completely honest as apparently even 

2835
02:12:32,661 --> 02:12:37,661
snopes says it's not clear the guy had,
he felt like he was the head of like,

2836
02:12:38,960 --> 02:12:42,230
it's so weird when this happens.
The Atkins Diet Guy,

2837
02:12:42,260 --> 02:12:44,060
when he died,
he weighed 258 pounds,

2838
02:12:44,180 --> 02:12:46,580
so he was overweight and he was 72 years
old.

2839
02:12:47,480 --> 02:12:51,590
And the story was that he slipped on ice
in front of his house and hit his head.

2840
02:12:52,490 --> 02:12:57,490
Um,
but he also had a history of heart 

2841
02:12:57,490 --> 02:12:57,920
disease.
I did not know that.

2842
02:12:57,950 --> 02:13:02,950
And he had had heart attacks.
Is that why he got into the research 

2843
02:13:02,950 --> 02:13:04,610
that led to the Diet?
I don't know.

2844
02:13:04,730 --> 02:13:05,890
I don't know.
Just read that today.

2845
02:13:05,900 --> 02:13:10,900
I'm like,
there's some conspiracy in was it was a 

2846
02:13:10,900 --> 02:13:13,870
Vegan guy who was talking about it,
but there's a conspiracy about adkins 

2847
02:13:13,870 --> 02:13:15,290
and that Atkins really died from a heart
attack,

2848
02:13:15,320 --> 02:13:19,340
which would ruin the brand when that 
found he was 258 pounds.

2849
02:13:19,341 --> 02:13:19,970
I was like,
wait,

2850
02:13:20,090 --> 02:13:21,980
how weight?
That's heavy.

2851
02:13:22,070 --> 02:13:23,840
How tall was he?
The report concludes,

2852
02:13:23,841 --> 02:13:28,841
uh,
Dr Atkins 72 at a history of heart 

2853
02:13:28,841 --> 02:13:30,761
attack and congestive heart failure and 
notes that he weighed 258 pounds at

2854
02:13:32,040 --> 02:13:32,630
death.
Yeah.

2855
02:13:33,270 --> 02:13:38,190
So he was really unhealthy,
which is really interesting because that

2856
02:13:38,400 --> 02:13:41,070
whole diet,
the Atkins Diet,

2857
02:13:41,100 --> 02:13:46,100
like a lot of people were really 
criticizing that diet and saying that 

2858
02:13:47,941 --> 02:13:52,941
it's really terrible and all the fat and
all this stuff to all the protein you 

2859
02:13:52,941 --> 02:13:53,760
eat,
you really shouldn't eat that much.

2860
02:13:54,630 --> 02:13:59,630
But it's very similar to what a lot of 
people are eating now when they're 

2861
02:13:59,630 --> 02:14:00,090
eating Paleo and they're eating low 
carb.

2862
02:14:00,720 --> 02:14:05,720
Apparently.
The real problem within our read this 

2863
02:14:05,720 --> 02:14:08,790
today about fat,
high fat diets is if you're going to eat

2864
02:14:08,791 --> 02:14:11,460
a high fat diet and must be a low carb 
diet as well,

2865
02:14:11,640 --> 02:14:16,640
you cannot have high,
high fat and carbs that is really bad 

2866
02:14:16,640 --> 02:14:20,571
for you because your body's going to use
all the carbohydrates for fuel and all 

2867
02:14:20,571 --> 02:14:24,381
the fat that you eat.
It's just going to be stored and 

2868
02:14:24,381 --> 02:14:27,200
apparently that combination,
especially with saturated fats is very 

2869
02:14:27,200 --> 02:14:27,200
bad.

2870
02:14:27,200 --> 02:14:30,450
So you want to be ketogenic or or you 
want to be close to it,

2871
02:14:30,840 --> 02:14:31,570
you know,
you wanna,

2872
02:14:31,590 --> 02:14:36,390
you essentially want to eliminate most 
of the stuff that people love.

2873
02:14:36,870 --> 02:14:40,710
Pizza and bread and pasta eliminate 
almost all that stuff.

2874
02:14:41,100 --> 02:14:44,880
That's just all those unnatural foods,
but the point being that I'd never heard

2875
02:14:44,881 --> 02:14:47,850
that.
I've always heard that he had fallen and

2876
02:14:48,170 --> 02:14:51,510
I'd assumed that anything other than 
that would be a conspiracy theory,

2877
02:14:52,200 --> 02:14:53,730
but then I read that and I was like,
whoa.

2878
02:14:54,270 --> 02:14:59,270
You know who wrote it?
Now remember John Joseph from the Cro 

2879
02:14:59,270 --> 02:14:59,270
mags.
You know that guy's a Vegan,

2880
02:14:59,760 --> 02:15:02,420
super healthy,
ultra marathon,

2881
02:15:02,470 --> 02:15:06,090
a triathlon dude.
Now he used to be.

2882
02:15:06,180 --> 02:15:08,370
We still is lead singer,
the chromatics.

2883
02:15:08,400 --> 02:15:10,230
I think they're still around.
I know he tore.

2884
02:15:10,240 --> 02:15:14,400
Still might be torn on his own now,
but he wrote that about Atkins today.

2885
02:15:14,500 --> 02:15:14,810
I was on.

2886
02:15:17,030 --> 02:15:18,530
Yeah.
Well,

2887
02:15:18,531 --> 02:15:22,730
just to tie this together.
The guy after he explains this to me,

2888
02:15:23,300 --> 02:15:28,300
he gives me a couple pills,
probably aspirin or something and he dip

2889
02:15:28,961 --> 02:15:31,100
some water out of a bucket and says,
take these pills.

2890
02:15:31,101 --> 02:15:33,860
You'll be fine.
I'd been traveling a long time.

2891
02:15:33,861 --> 02:15:36,860
I knew you don't drink water out of a 
bucket and the tropics,

2892
02:15:36,861 --> 02:15:38,720
but this guy just told me I wasn't going
to die,

2893
02:15:38,721 --> 02:15:43,721
so I'll do whatever the fuck he says.
And I drank the water and a week later 

2894
02:15:43,721 --> 02:15:43,721
and hepatitis.

2895
02:15:43,721 --> 02:15:44,830
Wow.

2896
02:15:44,900 --> 02:15:49,820
You got the hepatitis hepatitis from a 
bucket of this dude had laying around as

2897
02:15:50,030 --> 02:15:53,230
dirty shed.
That's crazy.

2898
02:15:53,240 --> 02:15:54,070
Exactly.
And that's.

2899
02:15:54,080 --> 02:15:56,860
You narrowed it down to that particular 
moment that you got hepatitis,

2900
02:15:57,350 --> 02:15:59,890
but I assume,
I mean that's a pretty high risk for.

2901
02:16:00,020 --> 02:16:01,740
Yeah.
Yeah.

2902
02:16:02,030 --> 02:16:03,410
Fucking crazy people with their guts

2903
02:16:03,430 --> 02:16:05,230
biome down there.
You know,

2904
02:16:05,231 --> 02:16:10,150
they can.
It's like if you see other animals drink

2905
02:16:10,151 --> 02:16:11,560
out of a puddle,
do you freak out?

2906
02:16:11,730 --> 02:16:12,420
No.
Yeah,

2907
02:16:12,500 --> 02:16:13,910
like a dog drinks out of public,
you know,

2908
02:16:13,920 --> 02:16:16,310
freak out because the dog's got bodies 
going to handle that.

2909
02:16:16,340 --> 02:16:21,340
Well,
that's what Jeff Leach was telling me 

2910
02:16:21,340 --> 02:16:22,721
about the Hudson.
They drink right out of mud puddles all 

2911
02:16:22,721 --> 02:16:22,721
the time.
It's like,

2912
02:16:22,721 --> 02:16:23,690
you know,
that's why he wanted their microbiome.

2913
02:16:24,640 --> 02:16:25,370
Yeah.
Yeah.

2914
02:16:25,371 --> 02:16:29,420
We have a weak ass bitch ass 
preservative laden microbiome

2915
02:16:30,460 --> 02:16:32,680
antibiotics.
You can avoid them.

2916
02:16:33,310 --> 02:16:35,980
It's hard to stay alive,
you know,

2917
02:16:36,030 --> 02:16:37,090
if you get really,
really,

2918
02:16:37,091 --> 02:16:37,840
really sad.
No,

2919
02:16:37,841 --> 02:16:40,570
I'm not talking about medical.
I'm talking about in the food supply,

2920
02:16:40,640 --> 02:16:42,880
the water supply.
They're everywhere in America.

2921
02:16:42,881 --> 02:16:45,580
I don't know if that really affects us 
that much.

2922
02:16:45,610 --> 02:16:46,840
They.
One of the things that I was.

2923
02:16:47,020 --> 02:16:52,020
I don't think there's levels of 
antibiotics in the water supply that's 

2924
02:16:52,020 --> 02:16:53,920
really affecting us.
It's possible that some of it is getting

2925
02:16:53,921 --> 02:16:57,520
to us in the food supply,
but more so than not,

2926
02:16:57,521 --> 02:17:01,960
I think the issue is poor dietary 
choices because poor dietary choices are

2927
02:17:01,961 --> 02:17:04,840
the number one factor and what affects 
your microbiome.

2928
02:17:04,841 --> 02:17:07,750
Super Low fiber,
low fiber.

2929
02:17:08,110 --> 02:17:13,110
Just not just not eating healthy.
If you're eating a lot of sugar in 

2930
02:17:13,110 --> 02:17:16,141
particular,
you've got candida running around your 

2931
02:17:16,141 --> 02:17:18,211
gut and they,
the unhealthy bacteria reacts better to 

2932
02:17:18,211 --> 02:17:19,870
that and your body starts craving it.

2933
02:17:20,020 --> 02:17:25,020
That's one of the weirdest things about 
when you do eat a low carb diet is your 

2934
02:17:25,020 --> 02:17:26,380
body's really doesn't crave 
carbohydrates anymore.

2935
02:17:26,650 --> 02:17:29,470
It's like it's a trick,
but when you're on carbohydrates,

2936
02:17:29,471 --> 02:17:32,080
if you eat them a lot and your body's 
craving them all the time,

2937
02:17:32,470 --> 02:17:37,470
it's like you are being influenced by 
those organisms that are in your 

2938
02:17:37,470 --> 02:17:38,500
digestive tract,
which is really freaky.

2939
02:17:39,100 --> 02:17:44,100
Yeah,
I mean that's the whole sort of super 

2940
02:17:44,100 --> 02:17:47,011
organism.
I think you and I've talked about that 

2941
02:17:47,011 --> 02:17:49,171
in the past,
the idea that w toxoplasmosis you know 

2942
02:17:49,171 --> 02:17:53,520
about that she says these things that 
get into the brain and determine 

2943
02:17:53,520 --> 02:17:56,350
behavior and from the gut as well can 
determine.

2944
02:17:56,380 --> 02:17:59,380
I mean,
not even something as simple as a simple

2945
02:17:59,381 --> 02:18:04,381
example of like wanting,
wanting the organism to crave the thing 

2946
02:18:04,381 --> 02:18:04,670
that,
that,

2947
02:18:04,870 --> 02:18:07,330
that works for them,
but not for the organism,

2948
02:18:07,960 --> 02:18:09,370
but man,
that weird,

2949
02:18:09,640 --> 02:18:14,620
like really complex behaviors that are 
created by some parasites in the brain,

2950
02:18:14,710 --> 02:18:17,170
you know,
like cats that are,

2951
02:18:17,171 --> 02:18:22,171
are mice that aren't afraid of cats and 
are actually attracted to the smell of 

2952
02:18:22,171 --> 02:18:22,270
cat piss.

2953
02:18:22,270 --> 02:18:23,670
Sexually attracted.
Yeah.

2954
02:18:23,680 --> 02:18:26,110
They get turned off.
It's crazy.

2955
02:18:26,111 --> 02:18:31,111
And that,
that bacteria or this toxoplasmosis can 

2956
02:18:31,111 --> 02:18:34,600
only grow and it can only reproduce 
inside a cat's gut.

2957
02:18:34,620 --> 02:18:36,460
Right?
Which is fucking bananas.

2958
02:18:36,880 --> 02:18:38,620
Like Paul Ski,
we,

2959
02:18:38,730 --> 02:18:39,630
Paul,
Ski Roberts,

2960
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:43,680
he's great and he went into depth about 
that and it's just,

2961
02:18:43,690 --> 02:18:45,310
it's one of those things where you just 
stop and go.

2962
02:18:45,311 --> 02:18:46,990
What?
He's a cool guy.

2963
02:18:46,991 --> 02:18:50,750
I remember mentioning him to you once on
this podcast and Jamie brought up is his

2964
02:18:50,770 --> 02:18:54,850
photo and you looked at his photo and 
you said there's a guy who does not give

2965
02:18:54,851 --> 02:18:59,851
a fuck if you look at it was crazy 
fucking hair ponytail.

2966
02:19:00,910 --> 02:19:02,660
He's homeless.
He's just,

2967
02:19:02,830 --> 02:19:05,830
he's interested in the work here yet.
Yeah.

2968
02:19:06,060 --> 02:19:07,090
Yeah.
The work,

2969
02:19:07,170 --> 02:19:09,220
yeah,
but he was gracious enough to give us an

2970
02:19:09,221 --> 02:19:14,221
hour there.
He is right there for a super nice guy 

2971
02:19:14,221 --> 02:19:14,221
too,
but just A.

2972
02:19:14,221 --> 02:19:18,530
I mean his work with baboons as well.
It was covered in a radiolab podcast is 

2973
02:19:18,791 --> 02:19:23,791
fascinating podcasts with the observed 
like this baboons is temporary baboo in 

2974
02:19:23,791 --> 02:19:24,770
utopia where.
Yeah,

2975
02:19:24,830 --> 02:19:28,330
you and I talked about that where the 
upper ranking males

2976
02:19:28,330 --> 02:19:30,800
eight,
the contaminated meat and died out.

2977
02:19:31,100 --> 02:19:32,350
Yeah.
I love that story.

2978
02:19:32,780 --> 02:19:36,050
It's one of the only hopeful fucking 
stories out there.

2979
02:19:36,100 --> 02:19:41,100
Well,
I feel like there's certain pockets of 

2980
02:19:41,100 --> 02:19:41,100
humanity like,
I mean I've never been to burning man,

2981
02:19:41,100 --> 02:19:43,690
but I assume that that's sort of a 
representation of that as well.

2982
02:19:43,990 --> 02:19:48,990
Certain pockets of humanity were 
likeminded people get together and they 

2983
02:19:48,990 --> 02:19:48,990
say,
well,

2984
02:19:48,990 --> 02:19:51,310
it doesn't have to be like this,
like just because we're all caught up in

2985
02:19:51,311 --> 02:19:56,311
this crazy trap and I think more of 
those little pockets of humanity are 

2986
02:19:56,311 --> 02:19:58,720
popping up day in,
day out.

2987
02:19:59,060 --> 02:20:02,080
I think this podcast represents that and
a lot of way to,

2988
02:20:02,130 --> 02:20:07,130
you know,
we're talking about the podcast being a 

2989
02:20:07,130 --> 02:20:08,581
cult of its own creation in in some way,
but I think it's more of a community.

2990
02:20:09,420 --> 02:20:11,770
Well no one's asking you to do anything 
and there's no,

2991
02:20:11,800 --> 02:20:13,240
there's no,
you know,

2992
02:20:13,480 --> 02:20:15,490
there's no rules,
but it's,

2993
02:20:15,610 --> 02:20:20,610
it's an opportunity for likeminded 
discussion that's rarely present in 

2994
02:20:22,150 --> 02:20:23,080
cubicle life.

2995
02:20:23,390 --> 02:20:28,390
When I think about,
I mean podcasts are in the intro to 

2996
02:20:28,390 --> 02:20:31,591
this,
this podcast book we were talking about 

2997
02:20:31,591 --> 02:20:33,601
earlier,
I said that I think that podcasting is 

2998
02:20:33,611 --> 02:20:38,611
on a par with the invention of the 
printing press in terms of the potential

2999
02:20:38,951 --> 02:20:43,951
for radical social change because 
there's no,

3000
02:20:44,350 --> 02:20:46,300
like you said before,
there's no filter.

3001
02:20:46,360 --> 02:20:51,360
There's nothing between you and your 
audience and that's a radical thing.

3002
02:20:52,450 --> 02:20:56,980
I mean the printing press said w when 
the printing press came about,

3003
02:20:56,981 --> 02:21:01,981
what that meant was you didn't need to 
have a team of scribes to copy out this 

3004
02:21:03,250 --> 02:21:04,350
thing that you've written.
Right?

3005
02:21:04,370 --> 02:21:07,420
Right.
So you can be just a regular guy and pay

3006
02:21:07,430 --> 02:21:12,430
the thousand bucks or whatever the 
equivalent of that was in medieval 

3007
02:21:12,430 --> 02:21:15,361
Europe.
And have all these pamphlets printed so 

3008
02:21:15,361 --> 02:21:18,070
you could be Martin Luther and change 
the world if you have a good idea and it

3009
02:21:18,071 --> 02:21:21,860
takes hold.
Podcasting seems similar to that in in,

3010
02:21:21,910 --> 02:21:26,910
in the sense that anybody who can afford
a few mikes in a laptop can get their 

3011
02:21:27,281 --> 02:21:32,281
message out and if it catches fire,
it catches fire it and it goes around 

3012
02:21:32,281 --> 02:21:32,680
the world.

3013
02:21:33,090 --> 02:21:38,090
You could do it on a phone to look.
We're saying you don't really need a 

3014
02:21:38,090 --> 02:21:40,701
whole lot of equipment.
A lot of people use one of those small 

3015
02:21:40,701 --> 02:21:40,701
mp3 Mike's a zoom.

3016
02:21:40,701 --> 02:21:42,540
We use that early on.
I still use a zoom.

3017
02:21:43,050 --> 02:21:43,870
Yeah,
I

3018
02:21:43,890 --> 02:21:46,570
see.
I think maybe I think you probably.

3019
02:21:46,571 --> 02:21:51,571
You're onto something.
I think the Internet in general and the 

3020
02:21:51,571 --> 02:21:51,610
ability for people to just create their 
own content,

3021
02:21:51,910 --> 02:21:56,910
that's the real.
The gatekeepers to the masses have 

3022
02:21:56,910 --> 02:22:00,820
always been these production companies,
content provider's networks,

3023
02:22:01,030 --> 02:22:06,030
all these people,
the hallowed halls and those people all 

3024
02:22:06,030 --> 02:22:08,520
got fat on it and a weird way because 
the gatekeepers are the ones that 

3025
02:22:08,520 --> 02:22:11,260
hoarded all the money and then they gave
some of the money to the actors and some

3026
02:22:11,261 --> 02:22:13,600
of the money to the writers and 
everybody got wealthy,

3027
02:22:13,601 --> 02:22:15,280
don't get me wrong,
but the gate,

3028
02:22:15,281 --> 02:22:18,100
the Harvey Weinsteins of the world is 
the one that really got rich.

3029
02:22:18,370 --> 02:22:23,370
If you look at that guy like that guy is
the guy that really got rich and really 

3030
02:22:23,370 --> 02:22:23,370
happy to,
oh,

3031
02:22:23,370 --> 02:22:25,030
he's doing really well.
He's doing super.

3032
02:22:25,320 --> 02:22:25,800
That's great.

3033
02:22:26,130 --> 02:22:31,130
He,
I mean obviously that guy's the worst 

3034
02:22:31,130 --> 02:22:31,130
example,
right?

3035
02:22:31,130 --> 02:22:34,680
But he obviously also on a positive 
note,

3036
02:22:34,980 --> 02:22:38,340
financed a lot of amazing movies and if,
if it wasn't for him,

3037
02:22:38,341 --> 02:22:41,010
they wouldn't have gotten done.
But clearly those people that do that,

3038
02:22:41,011 --> 02:22:44,370
there are different thing.
They're business people now is the first

3039
02:22:44,371 --> 02:22:49,371
time ever that there's a direct 
connection between a guy like you and a 

3040
02:22:50,071 --> 02:22:51,900
guy like whoever's listening to this 
right now,

3041
02:22:52,200 --> 02:22:55,410
that's never happened before.
I mean the only one in the room,

3042
02:22:55,850 --> 02:23:00,850
you know,
we have Jamie helping out and then it 

3043
02:23:00,850 --> 02:23:04,461
goes to the server and then it's 
uploaded to the rss feed and then it 

3044
02:23:04,461 --> 02:23:08,361
goes to itunes and it goes to wherever 
the fuck you're getting your podcast 

3045
02:23:08,361 --> 02:23:09,660
from and that's it.
There's no steps.

3046
02:23:09,661 --> 02:23:11,340
There's no network,
there's no notes,

3047
02:23:11,341 --> 02:23:14,730
there's no production.
Meaning if you did your podcast and your

3048
02:23:14,731 --> 02:23:16,950
podcast was on some radio network 
somewhere,

3049
02:23:16,951 --> 02:23:19,950
you'd have to go to meetings,
weekly meetings with the studio.

3050
02:23:20,160 --> 02:23:22,590
He'd have some fucking program director,
some Dick.

3051
02:23:22,591 --> 02:23:26,100
Fuck asshole wants to tell you what to 
talk about anymore.

3052
02:23:26,340 --> 02:23:27,060
Yeah.
Look,

3053
02:23:27,061 --> 02:23:28,650
you're losing.
You're losing sponsors.

3054
02:23:29,300 --> 02:23:31,770
I don't even have advertisers.
Good for you.

3055
02:23:32,080 --> 02:23:37,080
I do it.
I had him for awhile and I just got 

3056
02:23:37,080 --> 02:23:37,650
tired of listening to myself talking 
about underwear and shit.

3057
02:23:38,370 --> 02:23:39,720
So just do it for fun.
No,

3058
02:23:40,150 --> 02:23:41,750
no.
It's supported through patriot.

3059
02:23:41,790 --> 02:23:44,070
That's great to have people send me 
money.

3060
02:23:44,160 --> 02:23:48,120
This is what I think ultimately I think 
ultimately people will.

3061
02:23:48,121 --> 02:23:52,860
Someone's going to develop some sort of 
an app thing where you can.

3062
02:23:53,190 --> 02:23:58,190
You can like have basically everything 
you put out your podcast blogs,

3063
02:23:58,470 --> 02:24:01,050
although it would all be cut like a 
channel,

3064
02:24:01,500 --> 02:24:06,500
you could even call it channel and that 
would be like a new social media 

3065
02:24:06,500 --> 02:24:07,200
platform that you could do everything 
from,

3066
02:24:07,770 --> 02:24:12,770
you know,
and people could either sign up for it 

3067
02:24:12,770 --> 02:24:13,560
and pay for it or not,
you know,

3068
02:24:13,590 --> 02:24:14,880
that's how Sam Harris has it.

3069
02:24:15,210 --> 02:24:17,370
You can either pay for his podcast or 
not.

3070
02:24:17,400 --> 02:24:18,480
That's how you have it too,
right?

3071
02:24:19,050 --> 02:24:20,520
Yeah.
Although you get it for free.

3072
02:24:20,550 --> 02:24:21,300
Yeah.
You get it for free.

3073
02:24:21,301 --> 02:24:23,190
So if you want to support,
if you want to support it.

3074
02:24:23,200 --> 02:24:24,780
Okay.
You pay and I do some,

3075
02:24:24,820 --> 02:24:28,180
uh,
some bonus stuff for Patriana only.

3076
02:24:28,230 --> 02:24:29,140
Yeah.
Sam does.

3077
02:24:29,220 --> 02:24:30,810
It could be a buck a month,
you know?

3078
02:24:30,880 --> 02:24:31,620
Yeah.
Why not?

3079
02:24:31,950 --> 02:24:36,950
And I think there's,
the future's probably going to be 

3080
02:24:36,950 --> 02:24:37,530
something like that.
That's the present,

3081
02:24:37,560 --> 02:24:38,370
as you said.
I mean,

3082
02:24:38,500 --> 02:24:41,400
Sam's doing it.
Dunkin's got a Patriot on thing.

3083
02:24:41,401 --> 02:24:43,710
I do.
You got to get a Patriot on Joe.

3084
02:24:43,770 --> 02:24:44,880
No,
I make some money.

3085
02:24:44,940 --> 02:24:48,270
I make plenty of money with ads.
I don't.

3086
02:24:48,500 --> 02:24:53,500
I'm trying to think of like what.
It's almost like give the option if you 

3087
02:24:53,500 --> 02:24:55,440
pay,
you get no ads or a free.

3088
02:24:55,500 --> 02:24:56,550
A lot of people do that.

3089
02:24:56,600 --> 02:24:58,170
That's good.
Dan Savage does that.

3090
02:24:58,171 --> 02:25:00,870
He has the.
I forget what it's called,

3091
02:25:00,871 --> 02:25:02,910
but yeah,
there's the ad free version and the.

3092
02:25:03,030 --> 02:25:05,310
That's probably a good month,
if that makes sense,

3093
02:25:05,640 --> 02:25:06,900
because that way if you don't want to 
pay for it,

3094
02:25:06,901 --> 02:25:11,190
you don't have to,
but the point being that you can reach a

3095
02:25:11,191 --> 02:25:13,260
whole lot of people,
forget about paying.

3096
02:25:13,650 --> 02:25:18,650
You can reach a whole lot of people and 
get ideas to a whole lot of people that 

3097
02:25:18,650 --> 02:25:18,690
you could just never reached before.
No one would let you.

3098
02:25:18,930 --> 02:25:21,900
Why would anybody invest in you?
Why would they even put that time in and

3099
02:25:21,901 --> 02:25:23,800
then you're going to keep all of it a 
lot.

3100
02:25:24,180 --> 02:25:26,410
No Way.
When you think about publishing now,

3101
02:25:26,470 --> 02:25:28,840
right?
I write a book that bill comes out.

3102
02:25:28,841 --> 02:25:31,950
Somebody buys a copy of sex at dawn.
Right now in paperback,

3103
02:25:32,170 --> 02:25:36,300
I get eight point two,
five percent of the.

3104
02:25:36,410 --> 02:25:39,910
Of the price.
That's minus 15 percent of that.

3105
02:25:39,911 --> 02:25:43,810
That goes to my agent and then taxes.
That's Hilarious,

3106
02:25:43,840 --> 02:25:45,520
right?
I mean a pimp,

3107
02:25:45,521 --> 02:25:47,980
let's a hooker keep 50 percent of the 
money.

3108
02:25:48,620 --> 02:25:50,530
Wow.
A stingy pam.

3109
02:25:50,590 --> 02:25:53,830
What is a gate lady like?
J Dot k dot rowling's when she's balling

3110
02:25:53,831 --> 02:25:55,540
on top of the world kind of deal as she 
get.

3111
02:25:56,040 --> 02:25:58,230
What depends what she signed,
you know,

3112
02:25:58,330 --> 02:26:01,410
but I mean she's already like Stephen 
King.

3113
02:26:01,510 --> 02:26:04,210
People that occur,
they can cut a totally different deal,

3114
02:26:05,020 --> 02:26:07,900
but the standard contract is what I had,
which was,

3115
02:26:08,380 --> 02:26:11,170
you know,
eight percent on hard copy.

3116
02:26:11,171 --> 02:26:13,210
It's eight percent for 5,000
copies,

3117
02:26:13,211 --> 02:26:15,220
then 10 percent,
5,012

3118
02:26:15,221 --> 02:26:17,350
percent after that in hard copy.

3119
02:26:17,710 --> 02:26:20,500
And then paper bag is eight point two,
five percent forever.

3120
02:26:20,501 --> 02:26:25,501
How many books have you sold in America?
Maybe $400,000.

3121
02:26:25,631 --> 02:26:27,940
Four hundred 50,000,
something like that.

3122
02:26:28,350 --> 02:26:30,160
It's a lot of books.
Not really.

3123
02:26:30,640 --> 02:26:33,250
Not really.
I mean it's 20 languages.

3124
02:26:33,251 --> 02:26:36,760
That's what's cool.
It's worldwide filled with 400,000.

3125
02:26:36,860 --> 02:26:38,500
It's a lot of books.
If you look at it that way,

3126
02:26:38,501 --> 02:26:40,510
that's how you have to learn what it 
really is.

3127
02:26:41,430 --> 02:26:44,590
But in terms of money,
it's not that much money,

3128
02:26:44,860 --> 02:26:46,250
especially if you,
you know,

3129
02:26:46,330 --> 02:26:51,330
stretch it out over the years it took to
write it and all the promotion and all 

3130
02:26:51,330 --> 02:26:55,471
that.
It's not a way to make a lot of money 

3131
02:26:55,471 --> 02:26:55,471
writing books.
Even it used to be,

3132
02:26:55,471 --> 02:26:57,190
if you had a New York Times bestseller 
back in the day,

3133
02:26:57,191 --> 02:27:01,240
you've made a lot of money really.
But the reading audience is much smaller

3134
02:27:01,241 --> 02:27:03,160
now than it was 20,
30 years ago.

3135
02:27:03,250 --> 02:27:08,250
What about books on cassette or audio?
That's a different deal.

3136
02:27:08,321 --> 02:27:10,730
You signed a deal generally with 
audible,

3137
02:27:10,810 --> 02:27:15,130
they sort of own that market which is an
Amazon company,

3138
02:27:15,160 --> 02:27:17,140
right?
And uh,

3139
02:27:17,141 --> 02:27:18,130
yeah,
you get,

3140
02:27:18,131 --> 02:27:23,131
I forget what the percentages,
but it's probably 18 to 20 something 

3141
02:27:23,131 --> 02:27:24,220
like that.
And also,

3142
02:27:24,221 --> 02:27:26,920
um,
ebooks you get a slightly better deal.

3143
02:27:26,921 --> 02:27:30,400
I think you get 17 and a half percent of
the price of an Ebook,

3144
02:27:30,700 --> 02:27:35,700
which is funny though because it's not 
costing the publisher anything 

3145
02:27:35,700 --> 02:27:38,020
additional to have an Ebook,
it's already edited,

3146
02:27:38,021 --> 02:27:43,021
it's already the cover and all.
It's already done and there's no 

3147
02:27:43,021 --> 02:27:46,831
distribution cost.
So you get 17 and a half percent as a 

3148
02:27:46,831 --> 02:27:47,170
writer,
they get the rest.

3149
02:27:47,200 --> 02:27:48,760
That's so crazy.
There's no trucks,

3150
02:27:48,761 --> 02:27:50,500
there's no shelf,
there's no store,

3151
02:27:50,530 --> 02:27:52,420
no reason for them to be getting all 
that money.

3152
02:27:52,750 --> 02:27:54,760
That's so crazy.
It's all gravy for them.

3153
02:27:54,840 --> 02:27:59,840
Yeah.
And it's not like they're recouping 

3154
02:27:59,840 --> 02:28:00,910
costs and it used to be like back in 
hemingway or whatever,

3155
02:28:01,060 --> 02:28:06,060
back in the day a publisher would,
would support an author through three,

3156
02:28:06,110 --> 02:28:09,160
four or five books,
thinking eventually something's going to

3157
02:28:09,161 --> 02:28:14,161
hit.
This guy has got talent eventually and 

3158
02:28:14,161 --> 02:28:17,161
so it was an investment.
Now they expect you to have your own 

3159
02:28:17,161 --> 02:28:17,161
platform,
your own access to media.

3160
02:28:17,161 --> 02:28:21,190
You sometimes they're asking authors to 
hire their own editors,

3161
02:28:21,470 --> 02:28:23,030
their own publicists,
right?

3162
02:28:23,031 --> 02:28:23,870
Really?
Yeah.

3163
02:28:24,230 --> 02:28:29,230
But they still get all the money.
They still get the same contract that 

3164
02:28:29,230 --> 02:28:29,230
the ratios are the same.
So it's like.

3165
02:28:29,230 --> 02:28:34,211
Yeah,
that's why I say it's like a napster 

3166
02:28:34,211 --> 02:28:34,211
kind of thing.
It's at the point now where it's like,

3167
02:28:34,211 --> 02:28:35,790
wait a minute,
if I got a platform,

3168
02:28:35,930 --> 02:28:38,360
I got access to media,
I'm hiring my own editor.

3169
02:28:38,510 --> 02:28:41,450
Why?
Why am I giving you creative control?

3170
02:28:41,810 --> 02:28:45,080
And Ninety two percent of the fucking 
revenue.

3171
02:28:45,540 --> 02:28:49,280
It's a strange business.
That is a strange business.

3172
02:28:49,330 --> 02:28:52,850
Now essentially what they have is 
credibility.

3173
02:28:52,940 --> 02:28:56,120
So if you self publish or publish with 
some independent publisher,

3174
02:28:56,580 --> 02:29:00,370
The New York Times isn't going to review
it or won't know.

3175
02:29:00,890 --> 02:29:03,560
Wow.
Because it's a very insular world.

3176
02:29:04,320 --> 02:29:07,460
Well that's crazy.
If it's a book that takes off,

3177
02:29:07,700 --> 02:29:11,720
then a publisher will come in and buy.
So like 50 shades of gray.

3178
02:29:11,721 --> 02:29:13,670
That was self published.
I wonder why.

3179
02:29:14,110 --> 02:29:16,120
Yeah.
But look what happens.

3180
02:29:16,220 --> 02:29:17,900
Yeah.
They found they tapped into a market.

3181
02:29:17,901 --> 02:29:20,460
A chick that let's get spit on.
Right.

3182
02:29:20,490 --> 02:29:22,010
There are a lot of them.
There's a lot of them,

3183
02:29:22,180 --> 02:29:24,820
I don't know about their hood on,
but certainly joked.

3184
02:29:25,080 --> 02:29:27,320
Yeah.
Smacked around by a billionaire.

3185
02:29:27,380 --> 02:29:32,380
Yeah.
Good looking good looking guy with a 

3186
02:29:32,380 --> 02:29:32,380
heart of gold.
Gold.

3187
02:29:32,380 --> 02:29:32,380
But it likes to spit in your mouth.

3188
02:29:32,380 --> 02:29:33,290
Yeah.
And then she.

3189
02:29:33,291 --> 02:29:38,291
And then ultimately he'll see the light 
and of course he'll be taking course.

3190
02:29:39,050 --> 02:29:41,990
That's fantasy.
That's the fairy tale.

3191
02:29:43,150 --> 02:29:44,680
That's what everybody wants.
So you.

3192
02:29:44,681 --> 02:29:47,960
That's why I was saying earlier,
I've got this idea,

3193
02:29:47,961 --> 02:29:49,640
I was talking to Duncan about this the 
other night.

3194
02:29:49,641 --> 02:29:52,340
I've got this idea to write an erotic 
memoir,

3195
02:29:52,910 --> 02:29:57,910
but that'll sort of be like my last book
because at that point I'll have burned 

3196
02:29:57,910 --> 02:30:01,490
all the bridges.
You'll be the only person who would ever

3197
02:30:01,491 --> 02:30:06,491
interviewed me after that.
I think I was planning for it to come 

3198
02:30:06,491 --> 02:30:09,740
out around my 60th birthday and it it'll
be called an old manifesto.

3199
02:30:12,070 --> 02:30:14,900
It just changed the names of people.
Oh No.

3200
02:30:14,901 --> 02:30:19,901
I'm not worried about the people.
I'm not gonna hurt anybody in the bush 

3201
02:30:19,901 --> 02:30:19,980
or it's more just about.
You know,

3202
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:21,740
when people you fucked and people find 
out the truth.

3203
02:30:23,870 --> 02:30:25,010
Dude,
you're gonna become legendary.

3204
02:30:25,560 --> 02:30:28,820
But it's true though,
but it's not a book about how much I got

3205
02:30:28,821 --> 02:30:29,500
laid.
It's not.

3206
02:30:29,610 --> 02:30:34,610
It's not a book about how cool I am.
It's a book about the amazing things 

3207
02:30:34,911 --> 02:30:39,911
I've learned in sexual situations and 
that the world is so different from what

3208
02:30:43,251 --> 02:30:45,470
people think.
How so?

3209
02:30:47,540 --> 02:30:52,540
There's just so many things going on 
that mainstream people can't imagine.

3210
02:30:53,450 --> 02:30:55,250
Like,
I mean,

3211
02:30:55,251 --> 02:31:00,251
I was in college the first time a man 
told me he would be happy for me to have

3212
02:31:01,491 --> 02:31:06,230
sex with his wife and it wasn't a Kinky,
weird thing.

3213
02:31:06,231 --> 02:31:08,300
It was like,
I'm not doing it.

3214
02:31:08,360 --> 02:31:11,660
She's wonderful.
I noticed that you guys like each other.

3215
02:31:12,080 --> 02:31:14,510
I just want you to know it's cool with 
me.

3216
02:31:14,780 --> 02:31:18,200
Wow.
That's the first time since then there's

3217
02:31:18,320 --> 02:31:19,890
probably been,
I don't know,

3218
02:31:19,920 --> 02:31:20,190
half

3219
02:31:20,190 --> 02:31:22,060
a dozen or something.
Um,

3220
02:31:22,290 --> 02:31:27,290
mothers like,
would you please have sex with my 

3221
02:31:27,290 --> 02:31:27,290
daughter?
She is,

3222
02:31:27,290 --> 02:31:27,960
she really,
you know,

3223
02:31:28,460 --> 02:31:33,460
there is a good one.
Generally it's because she didn't like 

3224
02:31:34,260 --> 02:31:36,150
the boyfriend always.
Yeah.

3225
02:31:36,440 --> 02:31:36,990
So I was like,
well,

3226
02:31:36,991 --> 02:31:41,991
you show my daughter.
Like there's a world out there that she 

3227
02:31:41,991 --> 02:31:41,991
doesn't know about.
Yeah,

3228
02:31:41,991 --> 02:31:43,890
there's always that.
But then they recruit you and you got to

3229
02:31:43,891 --> 02:31:45,650
take on the project.
Well,

3230
02:31:46,230 --> 02:31:48,120
you know,
should you choose to accept it?

3231
02:31:48,121 --> 02:31:50,580
Should you choose to accept it?
They expect you to stick around as well.

3232
02:31:51,060 --> 02:31:56,060
Not necessarily just the world's weird 
stuff that people think like,

3233
02:31:57,210 --> 02:32:02,210
oh my God,
if you know you have sex with someone's 

3234
02:32:02,210 --> 02:32:02,210
wife and he knows he's going to kill 
you,

3235
02:32:02,210 --> 02:32:06,141
well maybe not.
Maybe it'll take you out for a beer 

3236
02:32:06,141 --> 02:32:08,001
afterwards and you'll be friends.
This is the subject of Arusha fears 

3237
02:32:08,001 --> 02:32:08,970
podcast this week with our,
uh,

3238
02:32:08,971 --> 02:32:13,971
with Aubrey Marcus and they're talking 
about open relationships and they get 

3239
02:32:13,971 --> 02:32:14,040
uber honest.

3240
02:32:14,130 --> 02:32:19,130
It's very intense.
I think that we live and cultural 

3241
02:32:19,130 --> 02:32:22,500
patterns and that what we see around us,
we replicate.

3242
02:32:22,501 --> 02:32:24,090
I think there's a lot of evidence for 
that.

3243
02:32:24,091 --> 02:32:26,430
If you just pay attention,
forget about studies,

3244
02:32:26,580 --> 02:32:29,010
just to look at how different people are
in other parts of the world.

3245
02:32:29,011 --> 02:32:32,010
People that are putting plates in their 
lips and rings through their noses.

3246
02:32:32,011 --> 02:32:34,470
People that the way people tattoo 
themselves,

3247
02:32:34,471 --> 02:32:37,560
the way people express themselves in 
dance,

3248
02:32:37,561 --> 02:32:42,561
like human beings vary so wildly and 
what we accept when we don't accept.

3249
02:32:43,110 --> 02:32:48,110
I was going to bring up Japan earlier.
It's one of the more fascinating travel 

3250
02:32:48,110 --> 02:32:52,040
experiences I've had was going to Japan 
because when you go to Tokyo you realize

3251
02:32:52,041 --> 02:32:54,750
like this is a completely different way 
of living.

3252
02:32:55,250 --> 02:32:58,320
Like they have a completely different 
way of interacting on the streets.

3253
02:32:58,650 --> 02:33:02,100
They have a completely different way 
that they have decorated their buildings

3254
02:33:02,130 --> 02:33:02,600
completely.

3255
02:33:02,740 --> 02:33:07,740
Like I have tattoos.
They told me I had to wear long sleeves 

3256
02:33:07,740 --> 02:33:08,280
at the gym.
I had to go back and change my shirt.

3257
02:33:08,880 --> 02:33:12,480
They don't accept expose tattoo 
associated with organized crime,

3258
02:33:12,950 --> 02:33:17,950
so I had to go back and just.
There's a lot of that like where you 

3259
02:33:17,950 --> 02:33:20,040
realize like this is a totally different
way of living,

3260
02:33:20,041 --> 02:33:22,140
but if I lived there I would live like 
these people.

3261
02:33:22,290 --> 02:33:27,290
So the.
The momentum of these patterns in these 

3262
02:33:27,290 --> 02:33:30,501
cultures gets established and then it 
takes something radical to lift them and

3263
02:33:31,711 --> 02:33:34,800
to free people from these patterns and 
once they're free from these patterns,

3264
02:33:34,980 --> 02:33:39,980
then they have a real opportunity to 
objectively assess the way they behave 

3265
02:33:40,020 --> 02:33:45,020
and whether or not this is the way they 
want to behave or the way they want to 

3266
02:33:45,020 --> 02:33:47,490
live or whether that just expect it to 
because of this unthinking culture.

3267
02:33:47,880 --> 02:33:50,480
Momentum.
Think that's what podcasts is doing.

3268
02:33:50,680 --> 02:33:51,220
The,
the,

3269
02:33:51,290 --> 02:33:54,810
the,
the big thing with podcasts is that it's

3270
02:33:54,811 --> 02:33:59,811
creating more narratives and it's 
creating more discussions about 

3271
02:34:00,270 --> 02:34:05,270
interesting subjects and more questions 
and discussions about like why we live 

3272
02:34:06,361 --> 02:34:11,361
our life a certain way.
And if you live a regular life with 

3273
02:34:11,361 --> 02:34:14,631
regular people,
what are the odds that you get a chance 

3274
02:34:14,631 --> 02:34:16,860
to sit down with a guy like you for 
three hours or a guy like Graham Hancock

3275
02:34:16,861 --> 02:34:17,980
or go like,
you know,

3276
02:34:17,981 --> 02:34:18,820
fill in the blank.
Well,

3277
02:34:18,821 --> 02:34:23,821
the fascinating people that you are.
I have talked to in our podcasts and 

3278
02:34:23,821 --> 02:34:26,770
then do these conversations get right in
someone's head.

3279
02:34:26,930 --> 02:34:31,930
Whether their earbuds on,
whether at work typing some nonsense 

3280
02:34:31,930 --> 02:34:35,110
bullshit into some fucking forms they 
have to fill out because that's what 

3281
02:34:35,110 --> 02:34:36,970
they do for a living.
That's what's different and that's never

3282
02:34:36,971 --> 02:34:40,600
happened before.
These I like no generation before.

3283
02:34:40,600 --> 02:34:44,080
The podcast generation had that option.
You had Howard Stern,

3284
02:34:44,290 --> 02:34:48,330
you had and it was always funny.
You had art.

3285
02:34:48,340 --> 02:34:53,340
Bell was always weird and then you had 
all the right wing Wacko dudes on am 

3286
02:34:53,771 --> 02:34:55,750
talk radio.
The Michael Savages,

3287
02:34:56,160 --> 02:35:00,060
you know the fucking rush limbaugh and 
you had all those people but you didn't.

3288
02:35:00,110 --> 02:35:05,110
Yeah.
You didn't have a guy who just talks 

3289
02:35:05,110 --> 02:35:05,140
about whatever he wants to talk about.
You had to be like,

3290
02:35:05,141 --> 02:35:05,890
well,
Chris,

3291
02:35:06,070 --> 02:35:09,210
before we give you this radio broadcast 
show what kind of a show you're going to

3292
02:35:09,220 --> 02:35:11,080
do?
You're going to do a left wing show.

3293
02:35:11,140 --> 02:35:13,380
You're going to do a show on cooking.
What are you going to do?

3294
02:35:13,700 --> 02:35:18,700
Now?
I'm going to talk about sex and tribes 

3295
02:35:18,700 --> 02:35:18,700
and about how I think monogamy is just 
a.

3296
02:35:18,700 --> 02:35:21,370
it's just a cultural construct and 
really the way we evolved like,

3297
02:35:21,380 --> 02:35:21,870
Whoa,
Whoa,

3298
02:35:21,871 --> 02:35:22,440
Whoa,
Whoa,

3299
02:35:22,441 --> 02:35:24,170
Whoa,
you fucking hippie.

3300
02:35:26,130 --> 02:35:31,130
There's no money in that,
like before you came to someone and 

3301
02:35:31,361 --> 02:35:31,990
said,
hey,

3302
02:35:32,350 --> 02:35:35,290
I'm going to write this book and it's 
going to sell about 400,000

3303
02:35:35,291 --> 02:35:37,360
copies and it's basically same.
Monogamy is bullshit.

3304
02:35:37,361 --> 02:35:38,590
What are you think?
They'd be like,

3305
02:35:38,591 --> 02:35:41,590
what the Fuck Outta here?
No one's going to buy that.

3306
02:35:41,591 --> 02:35:46,180
Everybody wants to be monogamous and 
have a picket fence and live in the same

3307
02:35:46,480 --> 02:35:48,730
row of houses where everybody looks the 
same.

3308
02:35:48,760 --> 02:35:50,590
Everybody's got this.
Oh you have an in ground pool.

3309
02:35:50,591 --> 02:35:53,250
You lucky bastard.
You know the,

3310
02:35:53,251 --> 02:35:58,251
what,
what podcasts have done is expose why we

3311
02:35:59,380 --> 02:36:04,380
accept things as fact and why we just 
chew it because everybody around us does

3312
02:36:04,991 --> 02:36:09,991
it.
We are such a massive product of our 

3313
02:36:09,991 --> 02:36:09,991
environment.
You know,

3314
02:36:09,991 --> 02:36:14,251
and I think when we were talking earlier
about race and about race being a 

3315
02:36:15,221 --> 02:36:19,540
determining factor for ICU,
like you don't really ever know.

3316
02:36:19,750 --> 02:36:24,750
You might know from studies,
but you don't know until those people 

3317
02:36:24,750 --> 02:36:28,290
who have the high Iq have to live the 
lives of the people that had the low Iq 

3318
02:36:28,390 --> 02:36:31,330
and they have to have the same 
environment that they grow up.

3319
02:36:31,340 --> 02:36:33,980
And the same fears and the same 
influences,

3320
02:36:34,000 --> 02:36:35,950
negative and positive,
then you'll know.

3321
02:36:36,100 --> 02:36:41,100
And even then you won't know because 
there's so many determining factors 

3322
02:36:41,100 --> 02:36:41,100
like,
you know,

3323
02:36:41,100 --> 02:36:43,930
I know people that are just way fucking 
smarter than me.

3324
02:36:44,110 --> 02:36:46,240
They're just smarter.
I just know they are.

3325
02:36:46,570 --> 02:36:48,730
They're just smarter.
What is that?

3326
02:36:48,760 --> 02:36:53,760
I don't know.
Is it the amount of studying they've 

3327
02:36:53,760 --> 02:36:54,250
done?
Is it the amount of knowledge they have?

3328
02:36:54,251 --> 02:36:56,980
Is that the path that they're on is 
different than my path?

3329
02:36:57,130 --> 02:36:59,050
Or is it just their fucking brain works 
better?

3330
02:36:59,360 --> 02:37:02,360
But also what do we mean by smarter?
You know,

3331
02:37:02,361 --> 02:37:04,570
I mean,
I look at someone like you.

3332
02:37:04,870 --> 02:37:09,050
Your discipline is a major factor in 
your success.

3333
02:37:09,650 --> 02:37:14,650
So is that part of being smart?
It's smart enough to understand the 

3334
02:37:14,650 --> 02:37:15,710
discipline as a worthwhile pursuit.
That's what it is.

3335
02:37:15,711 --> 02:37:16,010
So what

3336
02:37:16,010 --> 02:37:19,370
about someone who has a really high Iq 
that's sitting in a basement eating lots

3337
02:37:19,371 --> 02:37:22,400
of ice cream and not doing what they 
want to do?

3338
02:37:22,450 --> 02:37:24,350
That's not smart decision making for 
sure.

3339
02:37:24,380 --> 02:37:25,970
Yeah.
But it's very high Iq,

3340
02:37:26,020 --> 02:37:28,740
right?
So what do we mean for a hunter gatherer

3341
02:37:28,741 --> 02:37:32,720
of these people in the Amazon?
We're talking about who can identify 500

3342
02:37:32,721 --> 02:37:36,840
different kinds of plants at a glance 
and you know,

3343
02:37:36,920 --> 02:37:39,050
the behavior of animals and all this 
stuff,

3344
02:37:39,230 --> 02:37:42,590
but you give them an Iq test and they're
like under 100 for sure.

3345
02:37:42,650 --> 02:37:47,650
Well,
I've had conversations with people that 

3346
02:37:47,650 --> 02:37:49,511
are brilliant,
super brilliant people and science and 

3347
02:37:49,511 --> 02:37:52,631
they'll try to explain to me mixed 
martial arts and some fucked up 

3348
02:37:52,631 --> 02:37:53,030
cockamamie Wayne.
I have to stop them.

3349
02:37:53,930 --> 02:37:54,650
Stop.
Okay.

3350
02:37:54,651 --> 02:37:59,570
Right now you sound like a fucking moron
and I know you're not a professor,

3351
02:37:59,600 --> 02:38:02,290
but you're talking about something that 
I have a PhD,

3352
02:38:02,960 --> 02:38:04,970
I have a phd and people fucking people 
up.

3353
02:38:04,970 --> 02:38:06,920
I understand it as good as anybody 
that's ever lived.

3354
02:38:06,921 --> 02:38:10,340
So if you start talking nonsense about 
how to fuck people up,

3355
02:38:10,520 --> 02:38:12,350
Oh,
your Kung Fu instructor said that,

3356
02:38:12,690 --> 02:38:17,690
oh fuck.
I like Aikido.

3357
02:38:18,260 --> 02:38:20,300
But I recognize that there's a lot of 
bullshit.

3358
02:38:20,330 --> 02:38:21,920
There's a funding to practice.
I mean,

3359
02:38:21,921 --> 02:38:25,100
it's fun to be able to flip people 
around like that and it would be a great

3360
02:38:25,101 --> 02:38:30,101
thing to know if you lived in feudal 
Japan and you lost your sword and 

3361
02:38:30,101 --> 02:38:32,270
someone was coming at you when you had 
one chance at glory.

3362
02:38:32,840 --> 02:38:37,840
What I love about Aikido is how it 
translates into psychological and 

3363
02:38:37,840 --> 02:38:39,500
emotional stuff.
So what we were saying earlier about how

3364
02:38:39,501 --> 02:38:42,980
I don't engage with people who are 
emotionally triggered by sex at dawn.

3365
02:38:43,160 --> 02:38:44,300
To me that's like,
yeah,

3366
02:38:44,330 --> 02:38:45,090
yeah,
yeah.

3367
02:38:45,330 --> 02:38:50,330
No,
I learned that kind of thing for my 

3368
02:38:50,330 --> 02:38:50,330
Quito.
First of all,

3369
02:38:50,330 --> 02:38:50,330
you don't need to engage.

3370
02:38:50,330 --> 02:38:51,140
Secondly,
if you do engage,

3371
02:38:51,170 --> 02:38:55,820
what's important is that you stay calm 
and centered and most of the time people

3372
02:38:55,821 --> 02:38:58,370
burn themselves out.
You don't even really need to.

3373
02:38:58,730 --> 02:39:02,420
As long as you step out of the way,
let people have what they need to have.

3374
02:39:02,440 --> 02:39:03,710
Yeah,
for sure.

3375
02:39:03,770 --> 02:39:04,670
Yeah.
But yeah,

3376
02:39:04,671 --> 02:39:07,780
as far as the fighting technique,
it's not what you're going to pull up in

3377
02:39:07,781 --> 02:39:08,840
the street.
It's not,

3378
02:39:08,841 --> 02:39:13,841
but it's just my point is that people 
who are brilliant and are geniuses in 

3379
02:39:13,841 --> 02:39:18,371
one aspect of life simply don't have 
enough time to accumulate the same 

3380
02:39:18,371 --> 02:39:19,940
amount of data about everything.
Just don't sure whether it's,

3381
02:39:19,941 --> 02:39:20,960
uh,
about,

3382
02:39:21,800 --> 02:39:26,800
you know,
fill in the blank clock making or 

3383
02:39:26,800 --> 02:39:26,800
whatever the fuck it is.
There's just like,

3384
02:39:26,800 --> 02:39:26,850
there's things that people know that 
you're,

3385
02:39:26,930 --> 02:39:29,300
you don't know and it doesn't make you 
stupid.

3386
02:39:29,301 --> 02:39:34,301
It's just information.
The differences between how you apply 

3387
02:39:34,301 --> 02:39:34,301
that information.

3388
02:39:34,301 --> 02:39:35,750
Like if you're a really smart person,
you don't do shit with it,

3389
02:39:35,780 --> 02:39:39,140
you're a moron.
You might be a really genius person,

3390
02:39:39,141 --> 02:39:44,141
but if your life is falling apart and 
it's all because of your shitty 

3391
02:39:44,141 --> 02:39:46,841
decisions and you've never tried to 
improve upon your thought process and 

3392
02:39:46,841 --> 02:39:48,140
just blame the whole world instead of 
yourself,

3393
02:39:48,141 --> 02:39:53,141
you're a moron.
Even if you're really good at taking Iq 

3394
02:39:53,141 --> 02:39:53,141
tests.
That's it.

3395
02:39:53,141 --> 02:39:54,500
I mean,
I don't personally,

3396
02:39:54,501 --> 02:39:58,250
I don't think that I'm particularly 
intelligent.

3397
02:39:58,460 --> 02:40:03,460
I think that what I can do that a lot of
people don't do is think outside the box

3398
02:40:04,720 --> 02:40:07,130
and connect dots that other people 
aren't connecting,

3399
02:40:07,430 --> 02:40:12,430
which is precisely because I didn't go 
to the right schools and I,

3400
02:40:13,440 --> 02:40:14,010
you know,

3401
02:40:14,400 --> 02:40:17,190
in my twenties I went and fucked around 
the world for 20 years.

3402
02:40:17,520 --> 02:40:22,520
You don't have tenure that you're 
working for or anything that's going to 

3403
02:40:22,520 --> 02:40:27,200
keep you in,
lie around and figure it out and I mean 

3404
02:40:27,200 --> 02:40:27,330
that's the people that get stuck in 
that.

3405
02:40:27,440 --> 02:40:30,900
Even intellectuals,
they get stuck in that trap of having to

3406
02:40:30,901 --> 02:40:33,890
toe the line in terms of like.
I mean,

3407
02:40:33,960 --> 02:40:36,690
good luck trying to find a conservative 
professor.

3408
02:40:36,870 --> 02:40:41,870
Wright W,
four percent identify as conservatives 

3409
02:40:41,870 --> 02:40:46,150
in mainstream universities and colleges 
have some really ridiculously low 

3410
02:40:46,150 --> 02:40:47,250
number,
might be 10 percent,

3411
02:40:47,251 --> 02:40:50,310
whatever it is,
but it's the vast minority.

3412
02:40:51,080 --> 02:40:51,660
You know,
if one,

3413
02:40:51,690 --> 02:40:53,340
if you get one out a 10,
you're super lucky.

3414
02:40:53,400 --> 02:40:53,810
I think that's

3415
02:40:55,050 --> 02:40:57,350
again,
what do we mean by conservative?

3416
02:40:58,220 --> 02:41:00,320
It's so confusing because the older I 
get,

3417
02:41:00,321 --> 02:41:05,321
the more I realized that the language.
It's like one of those venn diagrams 

3418
02:41:06,621 --> 02:41:09,650
where there's language and there's 
reality and there's some overlap,

3419
02:41:09,651 --> 02:41:11,840
but there's a lot that doesn't 
correspond,

3420
02:41:12,600 --> 02:41:17,600
you know,
I get into this a lot when people are 

3421
02:41:17,600 --> 02:41:17,600
talking about homosexuality and whether 
it's,

3422
02:41:17,600 --> 02:41:21,590
you know,
human nature or its culture or whatever,

3423
02:41:21,591 --> 02:41:22,580
and it's like,
first of all,

3424
02:41:22,730 --> 02:41:25,610
what do we mean by homosexuality?
I,

3425
02:41:25,640 --> 02:41:26,960
you,
and I've talked about this before,

3426
02:41:26,961 --> 02:41:31,961
this tribe in Papa New Guinea where the 
boys suck as much dick as they can 

3427
02:41:31,961 --> 02:41:34,910
because they think that semen contains 
the essence of masculinity.

3428
02:41:35,300 --> 02:41:39,020
And so it's like,
to them that's not homosexual behavior,

3429
02:41:39,021 --> 02:41:43,220
that's normal male developmental 
behavior and you know,

3430
02:41:43,221 --> 02:41:44,330
we,
we look at that and say,

3431
02:41:44,331 --> 02:41:47,840
oh well that's gay,
but they don't see it as gay.

3432
02:41:47,841 --> 02:41:48,620
So again,
it's,

3433
02:41:48,920 --> 02:41:51,610
as you were saying,
we replicate the behavior we see around

3434
02:41:51,840 --> 02:41:56,170
they have adult homosexuality or do they
only have sex with kids?

3435
02:41:57,270 --> 02:42:02,270
I think it's only at least the only kind
that's been reported by anthropologists 

3436
02:42:02,270 --> 02:42:03,600
because again,
there's a filtering there,

3437
02:42:03,810 --> 02:42:08,810
of course is younger boys with older 
boys.

3438
02:42:09,360 --> 02:42:14,360
So it's the younger boys are given blow 
jobs to the older boys because that's 

3439
02:42:14,671 --> 02:42:18,190
the way to get stronger and more 
masculine scam.

3440
02:42:18,190 --> 02:42:23,190
Somebody pulled off one.
We have got no way of doing things with 

3441
02:42:29,520 --> 02:42:34,520
my Dick.
He pulls the grass skirt aside.

3442
02:42:34,950 --> 02:42:36,290
Oh Shit.
Here we go.

3443
02:42:36,450 --> 02:42:39,610
Here we go.
Yeah.

3444
02:42:40,540 --> 02:42:42,740
Yeah.
It's drums sucking.

3445
02:42:42,741 --> 02:42:43,620
Dicks pump,
pump,

3446
02:42:43,670 --> 02:42:44,180
pump,
pump,

3447
02:42:44,210 --> 02:42:44,790
pump,
pump,

3448
02:42:44,810 --> 02:42:45,270
pump,
pump.

3449
02:42:46,190 --> 02:42:48,120
There you go.
It's pretty crazy though.

3450
02:42:48,121 --> 02:42:53,121
Again,
like what we were saying earlier that 

3451
02:42:53,121 --> 02:42:55,041
you can have these pockets of culture 
that they're radically different than 

3452
02:42:55,041 --> 02:42:58,350
other places,
but the people just adapt and conform to

3453
02:42:58,351 --> 02:43:03,351
what's around them.
And I think that's the case with human 

3454
02:43:03,351 --> 02:43:06,141
beings everywhere.
I don't think it's just the people that 

3455
02:43:06,141 --> 02:43:07,110
live in New Guinea and it's not just the
people that live in the Congo or live in

3456
02:43:07,140 --> 02:43:09,270
woodland hills.
It's people that live everywhere.

3457
02:43:09,390 --> 02:43:12,100
It's just how human beings behave.
And it's also

3458
02:43:12,100 --> 02:43:15,550
interesting to look at how the culture 
reflects the environment.

3459
02:43:15,610 --> 02:43:16,320
Yes.
Right.

3460
02:43:16,340 --> 02:43:18,940
And Marvin Harris wrote about this 
cultural materialism,

3461
02:43:18,941 --> 02:43:23,941
how,
how a culture responds to an 

3462
02:43:23,941 --> 02:43:23,941
environment,
sort of like how,

3463
02:43:23,941 --> 02:43:26,680
you know Cacti live in the desert.
There's a reason for that.

3464
02:43:26,681 --> 02:43:28,870
You put a cactus in the jungle that dies
immediately,

3465
02:43:28,871 --> 02:43:31,180
right?
It's adapted to an environment.

3466
02:43:31,181 --> 02:43:33,300
So you've got desert cultures,
right?

3467
02:43:33,610 --> 02:43:38,610
You've got jungle cultures,
so the culture actually grows in a way 

3468
02:43:38,771 --> 02:43:42,080
that fits that ecological environment.
He,

3469
02:43:42,190 --> 02:43:47,190
he was the first.
I think he's the first person to figure 

3470
02:43:47,190 --> 02:43:47,190
this out.
Certainly the first time I read it,

3471
02:43:47,190 --> 02:43:51,930
like some island,
some cultures are cannibalistic and 

3472
02:43:51,930 --> 02:43:51,930
others aren't.
Right?

3473
02:43:51,930 --> 02:43:52,750
Why is that?
Like,

3474
02:43:52,751 --> 02:43:57,751
I'd never thought about it,
like why would the aztecs eat the,

3475
02:43:57,970 --> 02:44:00,070
their victims,
but the Christians didn't,

3476
02:44:00,071 --> 02:44:03,160
but the Christians killed a lot more.
They just left them to rot on the field.

3477
02:44:03,430 --> 02:44:06,280
Why is that?
Is that the Aztecs are particularly evil

3478
02:44:06,281 --> 02:44:07,180
or something?
I don't know.

3479
02:44:07,810 --> 02:44:12,810
Uh,
he applied this prism to it and show 

3480
02:44:12,810 --> 02:44:15,100
that also in the South Pacific,
there are some islands that were,

3481
02:44:15,140 --> 02:44:17,590
the people are cannibalistic and other 
islands where they weren't.

3482
02:44:17,820 --> 02:44:20,710
And so he looks at all these in when he 
figured out was that in the places where

3483
02:44:20,711 --> 02:44:25,711
people are cannibalistic,
there are no domesticated animals that 

3484
02:44:28,600 --> 02:44:31,780
eat different food than humans.
So for example,

3485
02:44:31,781 --> 02:44:35,020
you can't raise dogs for me because dogs
eat what we eat,

3486
02:44:35,650 --> 02:44:40,650
so it doesn't make sense.
But you can raise goats because goats 

3487
02:44:40,650 --> 02:44:40,650
eat shit.
Humans don't eat right.

3488
02:44:40,650 --> 02:44:45,510
So in the places that are cannibalistic,
there was no nothing they could 

3489
02:44:45,581 --> 02:44:50,581
domesticate for protein.
So when he killed a human yatim because 

3490
02:44:50,591 --> 02:44:53,890
your protein starved.
Wow.

3491
02:44:54,040 --> 02:44:56,950
Isn't that crazy?
So it's an ecological thing.

3492
02:44:56,980 --> 02:45:00,430
The aztecs had no pigs,
right?

3493
02:45:00,431 --> 02:45:02,110
There was nothing they could 
domesticate.

3494
02:45:02,111 --> 02:45:04,300
No cattle.
They had turkeys,

3495
02:45:04,301 --> 02:45:07,750
I think was the only time they had met 
from a person they killed.

3496
02:45:07,751 --> 02:45:10,090
There were so psyched to not just going 
to let it go.

3497
02:45:11,640 --> 02:45:11,960
Yeah.

3498
02:45:12,180 --> 02:45:13,650
They ever tell you that's the case with 
bears.

3499
02:45:14,370 --> 02:45:18,220
The bears are all cannibals.
Cannibals.

3500
02:45:18,390 --> 02:45:22,290
It's really dark.
My friend Jonathan saw a bore,

3501
02:45:22,350 --> 02:45:26,040
a male bear kill a cub and then saw the 
female eat it.

3502
02:45:26,370 --> 02:45:27,300
Oh,
the female,

3503
02:45:27,600 --> 02:45:31,500
the female chase the male way.
And after he'd killed that,

3504
02:45:31,501 --> 02:45:34,140
she was trying to eat it and she chased 
him away and then she ate it.

3505
02:45:34,450 --> 02:45:39,450
Shader own cub.
And he said he had heard that they did 

3506
02:45:39,450 --> 02:45:40,920
that before.
But watching that in person.

3507
02:45:41,340 --> 02:45:42,180
But they're all cannibal,

3508
02:45:42,270 --> 02:45:42,990
well,
lots of,

3509
02:45:43,020 --> 02:45:46,230
lots of mammal mothers will eat their 
young.

3510
02:45:46,530 --> 02:45:49,590
But these guys come out of the den 
looking for cubs.

3511
02:45:50,050 --> 02:45:52,010
The,
the spring bears,

3512
02:45:52,400 --> 02:45:53,940
they do it for two reasons.
They do it.

3513
02:45:53,941 --> 02:45:54,690
One,
they,

3514
02:45:54,750 --> 02:45:59,750
they,
they know now that it's not just to try 

3515
02:45:59,750 --> 02:45:59,750
to force the female and the Astros 
again,

3516
02:45:59,880 --> 02:46:03,390
they used to think it was just that.
But now they like if you shoot a bear,

3517
02:46:03,750 --> 02:46:08,750
other bears will claim it as their since
start eating it and you have to chase 

3518
02:46:08,750 --> 02:46:08,880
them off.
Like they're,

3519
02:46:09,450 --> 02:46:14,450
it's the world of a bear is so fucking 
hard scrabble and so fraught with peril 

3520
02:46:16,611 --> 02:46:18,260
and they have to,
you know,

3521
02:46:18,310 --> 02:46:21,210
you're talking about a 500 pound bear.
How much do you have to eat every day?

3522
02:46:21,800 --> 02:46:26,800
What do you have?
Do you like 30 pounds of meat or 

3523
02:46:26,800 --> 02:46:27,680
something like moths and everything?
Their machines,

3524
02:46:27,860 --> 02:46:31,100
where they are is they clean the forest 
up of babies.

3525
02:46:31,101 --> 02:46:36,101
They can't get away and any.
There's no overpopulating when there's 

3526
02:46:36,101 --> 02:46:36,940
hikers.
Yeah.

3527
02:46:36,980 --> 02:46:39,140
Well they.
Oh that's so rare.

3528
02:46:39,350 --> 02:46:42,380
It's so rare and it's more black bears 
in his brown bears.

3529
02:46:42,680 --> 02:46:47,680
When Brown bears kill people,
it's usually because someone fucked up 

3530
02:46:47,680 --> 02:46:51,161
and came across a female with her babies
and the females want to take any 

3531
02:46:51,161 --> 02:46:51,260
chances.
She fucks you up.

3532
02:46:51,680 --> 02:46:54,590
But when a blackberry too,
it's more likely for predation.

3533
02:46:55,030 --> 02:46:59,320
Also a black barrel chased up a tree.
A grizzly won't climb a tree.

3534
02:46:59,420 --> 02:47:00,230
Right?
That's true.

3535
02:47:00,231 --> 02:47:02,960
And a lot of times when the black bears 
are near people,

3536
02:47:03,050 --> 02:47:06,560
the reason is because people have 
encroached on their their areas and then

3537
02:47:06,561 --> 02:47:11,561
they started getting into eating garbage
and they start getting into eating 

3538
02:47:11,561 --> 02:47:14,771
garbage.
They become a real problem because 

3539
02:47:14,771 --> 02:47:14,771
they're smart and they realize like,
wow,

3540
02:47:14,771 --> 02:47:15,920
fucking chase after some deer when I 
could eat this dude's trash.

3541
02:47:16,300 --> 02:47:18,320
And then how much does he does dude?
Like they don't.

3542
02:47:18,350 --> 02:47:20,420
They don't think about the problems with
that.

3543
02:47:20,660 --> 02:47:23,060
This is going to bring heat on the Klan,
you know,

3544
02:47:23,061 --> 02:47:24,630
they just fuck that person up.

3545
02:47:24,770 --> 02:47:27,170
I spent a lot of time thinking about 
bears in Alaska.

3546
02:47:27,260 --> 02:47:28,490
You should.
Yeah,

3547
02:47:28,491 --> 02:47:31,220
I was working the first year.
It's so stupid.

3548
02:47:31,550 --> 02:47:35,450
I worked in this cannery in Kenai for 
like six weeks.

3549
02:47:35,460 --> 02:47:36,560
Salmon,
Salmon.

3550
02:47:36,561 --> 02:47:37,190
Cannery.
Yeah.

3551
02:47:37,430 --> 02:47:40,760
And I was a 16 hours a day,
seven days a week,

3552
02:47:40,761 --> 02:47:45,761
just like full on,
fucking busting it out because the fish 

3553
02:47:45,761 --> 02:47:46,640
are coming in and they got the lines 
around it and you know,

3554
02:47:46,940 --> 02:47:51,940
um,
and at night I would go back and sleep 

3555
02:47:51,940 --> 02:47:52,760
in my tent on this bluff where we were 
all camped out.

3556
02:47:52,761 --> 02:47:54,330
And so,
like,

3557
02:47:54,800 --> 02:47:59,800
you know,
after six weeks everything smelled like 

3558
02:47:59,800 --> 02:47:59,800
salmon,
everything,

3559
02:47:59,800 --> 02:48:01,550
my skin,
my hair,

3560
02:48:01,551 --> 02:48:03,790
my but everything.
And uh,

3561
02:48:03,830 --> 02:48:08,830
so after we left,
when I was with these two other dudes 

3562
02:48:08,830 --> 02:48:11,891
and we were like,
let's go to Mckinley and like hike for 

3563
02:48:11,891 --> 02:48:11,891
awhile and you know,
go in the.

3564
02:48:11,891 --> 02:48:11,950
And we're,
we hitchhiked,

3565
02:48:15,980 --> 02:48:20,950
we hitchhiked up to Denali and we were 
walking back this dirt road and this,

3566
02:48:21,240 --> 02:48:23,810
this,
a ranger came along and his truck and he

3567
02:48:23,811 --> 02:48:25,820
stopped and he was this cool guy,
you know,

3568
02:48:25,821 --> 02:48:26,420
and he's like,
Hey,

3569
02:48:26,421 --> 02:48:27,560
you guys have been working?
Like,

3570
02:48:27,561 --> 02:48:28,790
yeah man.
It's like,

3571
02:48:28,791 --> 02:48:30,200
Yay.
Where he'd been working at Canada.

3572
02:48:30,210 --> 02:48:32,010
Yeah.
And what do you,

3573
02:48:32,030 --> 02:48:33,200
you're going to go hiking now,
like,

3574
02:48:33,201 --> 02:48:33,710
yeah,
yeah.

3575
02:48:33,950 --> 02:48:37,100
He said,
do you realize that every bear within 20

3576
02:48:37,101 --> 02:48:40,850
miles of here can smell it?
And you smell like food,

3577
02:48:41,320 --> 02:48:42,890
like,
oh yeah,

3578
02:48:42,891 --> 02:48:46,640
I hadn't thought about that.
Like getting the truck back.

3579
02:48:46,740 --> 02:48:51,740
I probably saved your life more than the
guy who saved you from the Scorpion and 

3580
02:48:51,740 --> 02:48:51,740
gave you hepatitis.

3581
02:48:52,850 --> 02:48:54,020
Fucked me up,
man.

3582
02:48:54,080 --> 02:48:55,850
He did.
But the other guy really saved you.

3583
02:48:56,470 --> 02:48:58,340
Dude bears and fish.
Man.

3584
02:48:58,460 --> 02:49:00,740
That's a crazy combination.
And so the,

3585
02:49:00,741 --> 02:49:02,380
the big bears have.
Um,

3586
02:49:02,870 --> 02:49:04,220
cody cody.
I was out there.

3587
02:49:04,221 --> 02:49:06,980
That's the whole deal is that they're 
just having fish each wales,

3588
02:49:07,690 --> 02:49:08,430
the whales

3589
02:49:08,430 --> 02:49:09,630
eat everything.
That's,

3590
02:49:09,631 --> 02:49:11,640
that is,
that's a bananas place to be,

3591
02:49:11,641 --> 02:49:13,470
man.
When you were going to 12 foot bears,

3592
02:49:13,950 --> 02:49:18,950
I worked on a boat the second year I 
worked on a boat that was based at a 

3593
02:49:18,950 --> 02:49:19,470
Kodiak.
Did you get to see a lot of them?

3594
02:49:19,730 --> 02:49:20,580
Yeah.
And around.

3595
02:49:20,610 --> 02:49:22,050
Oh Man,
I saw the bears.

3596
02:49:22,051 --> 02:49:27,051
I saw orchids.
I saw we were out in Prince William 

3597
02:49:27,420 --> 02:49:32,420
Sound Orchestra,
the animal that I always point to that 

3598
02:49:32,420 --> 02:49:32,420
if they didn't exist and there was a 
legend of them,

3599
02:49:32,420 --> 02:49:34,170
it will be way more fascinating than 
bigfoot.

3600
02:49:34,830 --> 02:49:39,830
If somebody told you that there's some 
mammal that lives in the ocean and they 

3601
02:49:40,471 --> 02:49:44,400
communicate with each other through a 
complex series of sounds that we to this

3602
02:49:44,400 --> 02:49:47,370
day can't understand and that there are 
several times they have accent.

3603
02:49:47,380 --> 02:49:48,530
They have accents.
Yeah.

3604
02:49:48,531 --> 02:49:51,310
They have dialects.
They leap through the air and smashed.

3605
02:49:51,330 --> 02:49:51,720
They stay.

3606
02:49:51,750 --> 02:49:56,750
Stay together and pods for life in a 
very strong family bond if they didn't 

3607
02:49:56,750 --> 02:49:58,800
exist.
If this was just like some big foot type

3608
02:49:58,801 --> 02:50:03,801
myth,
it would be way more interesting than 

3609
02:50:03,801 --> 02:50:05,301
bigfoot is bigfoot dude just wanders 
around the woods and it's because big 

3610
02:50:05,301 --> 02:50:06,400
foot looks like a human.
Yeah.

3611
02:50:06,440 --> 02:50:06,980
You know,
so it's,

3612
02:50:07,220 --> 02:50:10,590
it's that wild.
It's the dog's fascinated by the wolf,

3613
02:50:10,620 --> 02:50:11,460
you know,
bright.

3614
02:50:11,740 --> 02:50:12,990
Yeah,
exactly.

3615
02:50:12,991 --> 02:50:14,280
Right.
That is exactly what it is.

3616
02:50:14,410 --> 02:50:15,540
That,
that could've been us.

3617
02:50:15,550 --> 02:50:20,550
We would.
You know about this genre of women who 

3618
02:50:20,550 --> 02:50:22,710
read bigfoot erotic literature.
There's a lot of it.

3619
02:50:22,720 --> 02:50:24,530
Yeah.
You should write some jokes should.

3620
02:50:24,840 --> 02:50:27,950
That should be my move.
Maybe that's just what I really like.

3621
02:50:27,951 --> 02:50:31,350
You can't like.
I'll write a blurb for you for sure.

3622
02:50:31,410 --> 02:50:36,410
Yeah.
I blur the lines between erotica and 

3623
02:50:36,410 --> 02:50:37,740
just like horrible hunting,
primal,

3624
02:50:37,910 --> 02:50:42,910
like slaughtering slaughtering of 
villagers and then fucking the women.

3625
02:50:43,500 --> 02:50:45,420
Like it'd be like some weird murder 
porn.

3626
02:50:45,570 --> 02:50:48,600
Like he would a storm into some weird 
log cabin.

3627
02:50:48,630 --> 02:50:50,940
You do that.
He'll do that famous photo of you.

3628
02:50:51,000 --> 02:50:53,370
You know,
looking all bad ass and black and white.

3629
02:50:53,430 --> 02:50:56,840
That's the background for the author.
That's your author photo for sure.

3630
02:50:56,880 --> 02:50:58,860
Drinks way too much coffee and it's 
getting me wet.

3631
02:50:58,861 --> 02:51:00,120
Just thinking about it.
Wow.

3632
02:51:00,121 --> 02:51:00,720
You get wet.

3633
02:51:03,460 --> 02:51:07,230
Fifty six years old.
Joe Got a little leakage by the way.

3634
02:51:07,260 --> 02:51:08,220
Last week.
Big,

3635
02:51:08,280 --> 02:51:11,760
big event in my life.
What have first prostate exam bitches.

3636
02:51:11,820 --> 02:51:12,480
Oh,
how was that?

3637
02:51:12,481 --> 02:51:14,850
It was fabulous.
Did it feel good?

3638
02:51:15,450 --> 02:51:16,260
No,
no,

3639
02:51:16,290 --> 02:51:16,910
no,
but.

3640
02:51:16,911 --> 02:51:18,600
But everything.
You look very healthy.

3641
02:51:18,630 --> 02:51:21,710
Can I just say that right now?
You look at and help.

3642
02:51:21,780 --> 02:51:26,780
Last time I saw you,
you and me and Duncan were here maybe 

3643
02:51:26,780 --> 02:51:27,510
three months ago.
There was a moment.

3644
02:51:27,990 --> 02:51:29,820
We're talking about something and you 
said,

3645
02:51:30,660 --> 02:51:33,210
you know,
go into yoga two days a week,

3646
02:51:33,211 --> 02:51:38,211
can change your life,
and you looked at me and I don't know 

3647
02:51:38,211 --> 02:51:38,211
that,
that this was happening on your end,

3648
02:51:38,211 --> 02:51:42,921
but in my end it felt significant.
It was Chris,

3649
02:51:43,290 --> 02:51:44,310
Chris,
you know,

3650
02:51:44,311 --> 02:51:46,800
just two yoga classes a week and change 
your life.

3651
02:51:46,810 --> 02:51:50,100
And I started going to yoga and I feel 
much better.

3652
02:51:50,130 --> 02:51:50,970
Oh,
look at that.

3653
02:51:50,980 --> 02:51:53,310
That's why you're all healthy looking 
that in my,

3654
02:51:53,311 --> 02:51:54,480
uh,
my urologist.

3655
02:51:54,830 --> 02:51:56,930
So I got to tell you about this 
urologist though.

3656
02:51:56,990 --> 02:51:58,740
Okay.
Super Cool Guy.

3657
02:51:58,770 --> 02:52:00,000
What'd you give him?
Four stars on Yelp.

3658
02:52:00,210 --> 02:52:02,110
I give him five.
Yeah.

3659
02:52:02,370 --> 02:52:06,520
Uh,
and in fact I've on beyond my podcast.

3660
02:52:06,580 --> 02:52:11,580
Oh Wow.
But he's hesitant to do it and I 

3661
02:52:11,580 --> 02:52:11,580
understand why he works for a big 
hospital and you know,

3662
02:52:11,700 --> 02:52:16,700
he doesn't want to become a rock star,
but we ended up hanging out in his 

3663
02:52:16,700 --> 02:52:19,651
office talking about this dude gave 
himself have a sec dummy.

3664
02:52:21,160 --> 02:52:22,210
Oh,
he's.

3665
02:52:22,270 --> 02:52:23,020
He told me,
he's like,

3666
02:52:23,021 --> 02:52:24,430
that's how bad he didn't want to have 
kids.

3667
02:52:26,460 --> 02:52:29,890
He pried his dick hole open delay.
He was just like,

3668
02:52:30,220 --> 02:52:31,330
you know,
I do it,

3669
02:52:31,331 --> 02:52:32,380
I've done it.
A lot of them,

3670
02:52:32,381 --> 02:52:34,030
I want to see what I could do it,
and he said,

3671
02:52:34,060 --> 02:52:35,740
Yo,
my wife wasn't into the idea,

3672
02:52:35,741 --> 02:52:39,730
but she insisted that I have a colleague
standing by in case I got into trouble,

3673
02:52:39,760 --> 02:52:44,760
so that made sense.
I did a guy who was going a little to 

3674
02:52:44,760 --> 02:52:45,100
the left to the left himself,
fucking vasectomy.

3675
02:52:45,130 --> 02:52:48,250
That is the most bad ass thing I think 
I've ever heard.

3676
02:52:48,400 --> 02:52:50,650
Did he like what did he do with his 
feet?

3677
02:52:51,580 --> 02:52:56,580
I don't know the position back here,
way back contortionists and just digging

3678
02:52:58,091 --> 02:53:02,140
in and he said,
it's on this side of the scrotum.

3679
02:53:02,170 --> 02:53:02,950
Maybe yours,
Bro,

3680
02:53:03,670 --> 02:53:04,300
not mine.
Oh,

3681
02:53:04,301 --> 02:53:08,740
you got yours.
But that's what they will be proud of.

3682
02:53:08,920 --> 02:53:11,050
I get the.
They told me I had the biggest pipe.

3683
02:53:11,350 --> 02:53:11,930
Well,
this data,

3684
02:53:11,990 --> 02:53:14,710
they did tie my tubes.
They said my never saw tubes like my.

3685
02:53:15,180 --> 02:53:18,190
He said to me afterwards,
he said,

3686
02:53:18,191 --> 02:53:20,040
you got the prostate.
Have a 20 year old.

3687
02:53:20,290 --> 02:53:22,270
I love you brother.
That's good.

3688
02:53:22,300 --> 02:53:23,560
That's good to hear.
Yeah,

3689
02:53:24,040 --> 02:53:26,020
it was really funny.
Where are you fixed?

3690
02:53:26,080 --> 02:53:27,100
No,
you're not.

3691
02:53:27,130 --> 02:53:29,710
You're still shooting live loads.
Who knows?

3692
02:53:29,840 --> 02:53:31,820
Who knows how alive they are at this 
point.

3693
02:53:32,260 --> 02:53:35,030
Now you got defects in your loads.
Yeah.

3694
02:53:35,240 --> 02:53:36,450
You get older,
you get defects,

3695
02:53:36,630 --> 02:53:37,650
right?
Yeah.

3696
02:53:38,230 --> 02:53:41,430
So do you really do look healthier?
I'm not bullshitting.

3697
02:53:41,470 --> 02:53:46,470
I saw that like instantly,
so two yoga classes a day or a week or a

3698
02:53:47,440 --> 02:53:49,940
week day of crazy,
but we come in here to make it,

3699
02:53:50,200 --> 02:53:52,060
but to a week really can change your 
life.

3700
02:53:52,570 --> 02:53:57,570
Yeah,
and I'm doing the like old lady classes 

3701
02:53:57,570 --> 02:54:00,031
to those old ladies are tough as fuck.
That's how they got to be old ladies 

3702
02:54:00,031 --> 02:54:00,031
dude.

3703
02:54:00,031 --> 02:54:00,430
Like plank position.
I'm like,

3704
02:54:00,490 --> 02:54:01,570
lady,
come on,

3705
02:54:01,600 --> 02:54:06,600
my arms are shaking.
There's some old ladies in my class at 

3706
02:54:06,600 --> 02:54:07,090
humbled me.
I take these old ladies,

3707
02:54:07,130 --> 02:54:11,050
old housewives and they're fucking tough
as shit and they're in there everyday.

3708
02:54:11,140 --> 02:54:13,720
I come there a couple days a week and 
they look at me like,

3709
02:54:13,721 --> 02:54:15,580
oh,
decided to drop in.

3710
02:54:15,970 --> 02:54:20,970
So I had to cut every day.
Every day you see their progress to 

3711
02:54:21,280 --> 02:54:26,280
especially.
It's very impressive to me when you see 

3712
02:54:26,280 --> 02:54:29,430
flexibility,
progress and old people and you realize 

3713
02:54:29,430 --> 02:54:32,130
like most of what we take for decide 
like,

3714
02:54:32,140 --> 02:54:37,140
oh,
this is how far your body should move 

3715
02:54:37,140 --> 02:54:37,900
when you're 60 or this is how your body 
should move your 70 space in the average

3716
02:54:37,901 --> 02:54:40,300
person who doesn't do a goddamn thing 
with their body.

3717
02:54:40,301 --> 02:54:42,080
They don't grow up thinking you don't 
eat right.

3718
02:54:42,130 --> 02:54:44,140
Again,
it's based on what you see around you.

3719
02:54:44,500 --> 02:54:47,350
In Spain,
everybody goes for a walk after dinner,

3720
02:54:47,410 --> 02:54:48,700
you can be 90 years old.

3721
02:54:48,700 --> 02:54:50,740
They're out there walking in after the 
way to go to.

3722
02:54:50,790 --> 02:54:55,790
It's nice if you go to a place,
it feels good to have a meal and walk 

3723
02:54:55,790 --> 02:54:59,851
around.
That's why it's like you ever eaten 

3724
02:54:59,851 --> 02:54:59,851
Malibu.
There's a Malibu seafood.

3725
02:54:59,851 --> 02:55:00,770
Do you ever see that?
You know that place,

3726
02:55:00,860 --> 02:55:02,560
right?
Right on that little PCA.

3727
02:55:02,561 --> 02:55:07,561
Yeah.
Eat outside is really good and have 

3728
02:55:07,561 --> 02:55:08,500
fresh seafood there all the time.
About the real in.

3729
02:55:08,940 --> 02:55:09,240
No,
no,

3730
02:55:09,250 --> 02:55:10,970
no.
I think it's called Malibu seafood.

3731
02:55:11,180 --> 02:55:12,620
That's what it's called,
but anyway,

3732
02:55:13,340 --> 02:55:18,340
the problem is getting across the pch.
You got to get across pch says death 

3733
02:55:18,340 --> 02:55:18,340
defying.
Oh,

3734
02:55:18,340 --> 02:55:19,730
you park on one side and ran across.
Yeah,

3735
02:55:19,731 --> 02:55:21,860
that's across.
Especially with little kids.

3736
02:55:21,861 --> 02:55:23,600
That's fucking scared.
She'd go to the real end.

3737
02:55:23,630 --> 02:55:25,790
It's on the pch down near to paying.
I've heard.

3738
02:55:25,791 --> 02:55:26,780
That's good.
It is good.

3739
02:55:26,781 --> 02:55:27,980
And they've got tables outside.

3740
02:55:27,980 --> 02:55:30,770
You can bring a dog and they kind of 
picnic tables.

3741
02:55:30,830 --> 02:55:33,230
Anyway,
we talk about this after.

3742
02:55:33,231 --> 02:55:34,970
Yeah,
but there's something about.

3743
02:55:35,390 --> 02:55:36,890
There's another restaurant in Malibu 
too.

3744
02:55:36,891 --> 02:55:39,320
That's a really good spot.
It's like right on the beach and you can

3745
02:55:39,620 --> 02:55:43,520
eat and then just go walk and it's like 
walking on the beach or just going for a

3746
02:55:43,521 --> 02:55:46,280
walk like right after a meal.
That's what everybody's supposed to do.

3747
02:55:46,490 --> 02:55:47,280
Yeah,
no,

3748
02:55:47,510 --> 02:55:48,370
for sure.
Yeah.

3749
02:55:48,630 --> 02:55:51,530
It helps digestion and when you live in 
a,

3750
02:55:51,580 --> 02:55:53,420
you know,
I saw this so much in Spain.

3751
02:55:53,421 --> 02:55:55,370
When you live in a culture that's 
healthy,

3752
02:55:55,880 --> 02:55:58,490
you're healthy.
You know what my favorite example is?

3753
02:55:58,700 --> 02:55:59,660
Boulder,
Colorado.

3754
02:56:00,250 --> 02:56:05,250
You go to boulder,
everybody's got fucking Patagonia 

3755
02:56:05,250 --> 02:56:07,661
jackets on.
They're running up hills and dirt bike 

3756
02:56:07,661 --> 02:56:10,451
riding.
There's a yoga place every corner and 

3757
02:56:10,451 --> 02:56:10,451
people are having fun.
Having a good to not work.

3758
02:56:10,451 --> 02:56:11,150
No,
it's fun.

3759
02:56:11,360 --> 02:56:14,420
It bulb exercise is fun.
That's what people don't understand.

3760
02:56:14,421 --> 02:56:19,421
It's really an,
it's not fun to be unhealthy and when 

3761
02:56:19,421 --> 02:56:20,360
you try to exercise,
when you're unhealthy,

3762
02:56:20,361 --> 02:56:22,460
it feels like shit because your body 
feels like shit.

3763
02:56:22,640 --> 02:56:25,880
But once you get the dust knocked off of
it and get it moving.

3764
02:56:26,060 --> 02:56:30,110
And I'm not talking about crossfit or 
fucking mma training or Jujitsu,

3765
02:56:30,111 --> 02:56:31,850
I'm just talking about any kind of 
exercise.

3766
02:56:31,930 --> 02:56:34,160
Just get that blood flow and you'll be,
uh,

3767
02:56:34,250 --> 02:56:37,910
you'll be a better version of you.
I got a bike.

3768
02:56:38,370 --> 02:56:39,680
I don't know if you don't have talked 
about this.

3769
02:56:39,681 --> 02:56:41,720
It's this electric assist.
A mountain bike.

3770
02:56:41,750 --> 02:56:46,750
Oh yeah.
My friend John Dudley has those made so 

3771
02:56:46,750 --> 02:56:47,460
much fun.
Yeah.

3772
02:56:47,600 --> 02:56:51,020
And where I live it's like uphill to get
to any of the fire roads.

3773
02:56:51,350 --> 02:56:54,590
So a normal bike.
I'm just not going to do it because it's

3774
02:56:54,591 --> 02:56:57,200
like a half hour of hell to get any real
interesting.

3775
02:56:57,710 --> 02:57:00,740
But this thing it,
it only assists when you pedal.

3776
02:57:00,970 --> 02:57:05,970
Now there's no throttle or anything.
A specialized gave it to me because I 

3777
02:57:05,970 --> 02:57:10,630
had this dude on my podcast who is,
I'm a professional mountain bike racer,

3778
02:57:11,420 --> 02:57:12,590
and he was like,
dude,

3779
02:57:12,591 --> 02:57:15,560
you got to get a bike here in Topanga.
This is heaven here.

3780
02:57:16,010 --> 02:57:16,730
And I was like,
yeah,

3781
02:57:16,731 --> 02:57:18,890
but like that's where I would ride,
you know,

3782
02:57:18,920 --> 02:57:20,270
way the fuck up there.
And he's like,

3783
02:57:20,271 --> 02:57:21,470
yeah,
let me talk to some people.

3784
02:57:21,770 --> 02:57:26,770
Well my buddy John Dudley uses those for
deer hunting because when you walk on 

3785
02:57:26,871 --> 02:57:31,871
the ground,
well not just that when you walk on the 

3786
02:57:31,871 --> 02:57:31,871
ground,
you leave,

3787
02:57:31,871 --> 02:57:33,500
sent a.
So instead of doing that,

3788
02:57:33,501 --> 02:57:35,450
he rides a bike.
So when you ride a bike,

3789
02:57:35,480 --> 02:57:40,480
you're just like deers.
Nose is so much stronger and more 

3790
02:57:40,611 --> 02:57:45,611
powerful than ours that if the wind is 
at your back and the deers in front of 

3791
02:57:45,611 --> 02:57:45,611
you,
you're fucked.

3792
02:57:45,611 --> 02:57:47,870
You're fucked.
But if you play the wind correctly,

3793
02:57:48,020 --> 02:57:53,020
one of the best ways to avoid leaving 
scent of a deer passes by after you've 

3794
02:57:53,020 --> 02:57:56,741
been there is to ride a bike.
But you don't want to ride a bike and 

3795
02:57:56,741 --> 02:58:00,521
exert yourself because then you'll be 
sweaty and you have to sit in a tree 

3796
02:58:00,521 --> 02:58:00,950
stand.
You'll freeze your fucking ass off.

3797
02:58:01,230 --> 02:58:04,410
So instead he has these electric assist 
bikes and they're fucking amazing.

3798
02:58:04,680 --> 02:58:08,220
And when I was in Iowa,
we took these suckers out into the woods

3799
02:58:08,250 --> 02:58:09,630
bond.
It's amazing.

3800
02:58:09,690 --> 02:58:11,880
Like easy pill,
doesn't matter,

3801
02:58:12,180 --> 02:58:14,290
just rode up the hill.
No problem.

3802
02:58:14,340 --> 02:58:15,900
Yeah,
it's still an effort,

3803
02:58:15,901 --> 02:58:19,500
but it's not like you don't.
It's just like a light walk.

3804
02:58:20,120 --> 02:58:21,940
They're awesome.
I took it out to Utah.

3805
02:58:21,941 --> 02:58:26,550
I was out in the van scarlet to Vanson 
and I were out in a canyon lands.

3806
02:58:27,080 --> 02:58:28,710
That's so nice,
man.

3807
02:58:28,770 --> 02:58:30,780
That's so pretty.
And there was this one ride,

3808
02:58:30,840 --> 02:58:35,130
it was like 20 miles I think out on this
jeep track,

3809
02:58:35,190 --> 02:58:38,790
like you could never go on.
I mean even in a jeep,

3810
02:58:39,000 --> 02:58:44,000
a serious four wheel drive,
you're going two miles an hour instead 

3811
02:58:44,000 --> 02:58:44,000
of these.
But on this bike,

3812
02:58:44,000 --> 02:58:48,870
just just cruise and 20 miles out to 
where the Colorado and the Green River 

3813
02:58:49,441 --> 02:58:52,230
converge.
It's this canyon.

3814
02:58:52,410 --> 02:58:54,750
Nobody out there.
And I'm just cruising.

3815
02:58:54,900 --> 02:58:57,180
It's like riding a horse.
It's so cool.

3816
02:58:57,630 --> 02:59:02,630
Well,
I did think at one point when I was 

3817
02:59:02,630 --> 02:59:02,940
going through this field with tall 
grasses that I,

3818
02:59:03,480 --> 02:59:08,480
to a cougar,
I would have looked like impossible to 

3819
02:59:08,480 --> 02:59:08,480
resist.
Yeah.

3820
02:59:08,480 --> 02:59:10,410
Yeah.
Maybe top speeds.

3821
02:59:10,411 --> 02:59:12,420
Twenty miles an hour.
So it would have gotten me.

3822
02:59:12,900 --> 02:59:15,480
Most cougars are not really into 
attacking people,

3823
02:59:15,481 --> 02:59:17,610
but they have attack people on mountain 
bikes before.

3824
02:59:17,670 --> 02:59:20,090
Sure.
Yeah.

3825
02:59:20,160 --> 02:59:22,440
Yeah.
I think it's like a yarn thing,

3826
02:59:22,441 --> 02:59:23,310
like a ball of yarn.

3827
02:59:23,670 --> 02:59:25,500
Kitten just can't help it.
Well,

3828
02:59:25,501 --> 02:59:26,400
you've got cats,
right?

3829
02:59:26,420 --> 02:59:27,750
Yeah.
I somehow,

3830
02:59:27,751 --> 02:59:29,970
I,
I feel like cats are similar enough that

3831
02:59:29,971 --> 02:59:32,930
if I saw a cougar,
I wouldn't know how to deal with it just

3832
02:59:32,940 --> 02:59:35,010
because I know cats.
Man.

3833
02:59:35,040 --> 02:59:40,040
You can look in bluff a cat.
Do you see the video I posted up today 

3834
02:59:40,040 --> 02:59:43,011
where a guy in boulder,
so for fucking mountain lions on a 

3835
02:59:43,011 --> 02:59:45,841
street for together with family,
it was the big ones for full grown 

3836
02:59:46,321 --> 02:59:47,820
fucking man,
not a mother.

3837
02:59:47,821 --> 02:59:51,440
And yet they don't hang together.
Taro,

3838
02:59:51,540 --> 02:59:55,380
not according to this fucking video.
Go full screen and freak us out,

3839
02:59:55,381 --> 02:59:57,600
Jamie or not.
Yeah,

3840
02:59:57,660 --> 02:59:59,280
but there's two sides.
Look at that.

3841
02:59:59,490 --> 03:00:03,210
Two big ass grown ass mountain lions,
and then they go down the street.

3842
03:00:03,211 --> 03:00:04,620
Look,
what do we have at the end of the road?

3843
03:00:04,890 --> 03:00:08,460
Oh,
another big ass grown ass mountain lion.

3844
03:00:08,580 --> 03:00:09,720
And another one line on.

3845
03:00:09,720 --> 03:00:11,130
It's back over there.
Wow.

3846
03:00:11,160 --> 03:00:16,160
Imagine turning that corner and you're 
fucking electric bikes road during the 

3847
03:00:18,781 --> 03:00:20,310
fucking road.
So this guy,

3848
03:00:20,311 --> 03:00:23,130
this is his house.
This guy's looking out of his house.

3849
03:00:23,450 --> 03:00:26,760
He's outside of Boulder Mountain lions.
Don't give a shit.

3850
03:00:26,761 --> 03:00:29,130
That's where I'm a mountain.
Lion ate my dog and boulder.

3851
03:00:29,340 --> 03:00:31,880
Really?
Dogs all the time.

3852
03:00:32,270 --> 03:00:33,990
They get them.
They hang around near your house.

3853
03:00:34,470 --> 03:00:36,330
They start targeting your dogs.
It's easy.

3854
03:00:36,331 --> 03:00:38,730
Prey.
Got Eaten by a lion.

3855
03:00:38,800 --> 03:00:41,250
A real the African lion.
Oh Shit.

3856
03:00:41,251 --> 03:00:42,480
That's,
that's more scary.

3857
03:00:42,950 --> 03:00:44,820
Yeah,
it's Africa.

3858
03:00:44,970 --> 03:00:46,800
Fuck.
What kind of dog was it?

3859
03:00:46,990 --> 03:00:50,370
Was a small Pomeranian American eskimo 
mix.

3860
03:00:50,830 --> 03:00:54,930
Sweet out of a dog.
He was a great dog.

3861
03:00:55,350 --> 03:00:57,300
Worse ways to go.
Yeah.

3862
03:00:57,750 --> 03:00:59,710
Look,
there's just some out there,

3863
03:00:59,711 --> 03:01:00,160
man.

3864
03:01:00,280 --> 03:01:05,280
Between the bears and the dogs or the 
cats and also the foxes.

3865
03:01:05,800 --> 03:01:07,450
Foxes are amazing.
I mean,

3866
03:01:07,480 --> 03:01:09,310
I love foxes.
I mean,

3867
03:01:09,640 --> 03:01:14,640
I think they're really interesting 
animals and they're one of the few 

3868
03:01:14,640 --> 03:01:17,671
animals in the wild that will,
if you live in a certain area for long 

3869
03:01:17,671 --> 03:01:18,910
enough,
they will almost become domesticated,

3870
03:01:19,140 --> 03:01:24,140
like they get close to you and hang out 
with you and you could feed them and 

3871
03:01:24,140 --> 03:01:26,401
they'll,
they'll walk with you and hang out with 

3872
03:01:26,401 --> 03:01:26,401
you.
Like real close by.

3873
03:01:26,401 --> 03:01:28,330
There are weird animal.
They're not quite a wolf and they're not

3874
03:01:28,331 --> 03:01:32,640
like a coyote like a Fox.
Our relationship with Fox is,

3875
03:01:32,641 --> 03:01:34,960
is very playful,
you know?

3876
03:01:35,290 --> 03:01:39,460
Have you ever seen a grizzly man?
Remember his relationship with the Fox,

3877
03:01:39,530 --> 03:01:41,500
hung around the campsite or something.
Took his hat,

3878
03:01:41,501 --> 03:01:43,420
stole his,
had ran away and they were playing.

3879
03:01:44,180 --> 03:01:46,960
The Fox used to sit on his tent and he'd
be right there and be like,

3880
03:01:46,961 --> 03:01:47,620
how are you?

3881
03:01:47,650 --> 03:01:49,150
Good morning today.
I like that.

3882
03:01:49,210 --> 03:01:50,680
They would just hang with them and walk 
with them.

3883
03:01:50,860 --> 03:01:55,860
There's that lady sue Akins who lives.
She lives 200 plus miles above the 

3884
03:01:56,081 --> 03:01:57,670
arctic circle.
She's on that show.

3885
03:01:57,671 --> 03:01:59,020
Life below zero.
There it is.

3886
03:01:59,021 --> 03:02:00,360
There's the grizzly man,
like,

3887
03:02:00,370 --> 03:02:02,710
look at this fucking animal just hanging
with him,

3888
03:02:02,711 --> 03:02:03,430
man.
I mean,

3889
03:02:03,431 --> 03:02:08,431
it's an odd way the fuck out the way the
fuck out.

3890
03:02:08,771 --> 03:02:13,771
But once they get accustomed to you,
they're very intelligent and they 

3891
03:02:13,771 --> 03:02:14,410
realized like,
this guy's not going to hurt me.

3892
03:02:14,700 --> 03:02:17,500
And then they become like your little 
buddy and if you give them food,

3893
03:02:17,501 --> 03:02:22,501
I mean,
this is essentially how animals got 

3894
03:02:22,501 --> 03:02:22,501
domesticated,
right?

3895
03:02:22,501 --> 03:02:22,501
Right.
This is how wolves became dogs.

3896
03:02:22,501 --> 03:02:27,150
They just hung around with us long 
enough that when they were outside the 

3897
03:02:27,150 --> 03:02:31,051
edge of the campfire and we gave them 
food to keep them from attacking us or 

3898
03:02:31,051 --> 03:02:31,051
whatever.

3899
03:02:31,051 --> 03:02:32,770
But Fox is,
and in particular,

3900
03:02:33,250 --> 03:02:35,470
they'll kill the shit out of your cat,
but kill your dog.

3901
03:02:35,710 --> 03:02:37,910
Foxes will kill a lot of things to kill 
a lot of fonts.

3902
03:02:38,290 --> 03:02:38,840
You know,
it's,

3903
03:02:38,870 --> 03:02:39,830
I,
I saw um,

3904
03:02:40,020 --> 03:02:45,020
a fox on,
on the Internet with a font that was 

3905
03:02:45,020 --> 03:02:48,320
almost as big as its body and it was 
dragging this font across this,

3906
03:02:48,330 --> 03:02:49,300
uh,
this road.

3907
03:02:49,301 --> 03:02:49,900
And I was like,
oh,

3908
03:02:50,620 --> 03:02:52,360
I never thought it would kill something 
that big.

3909
03:02:52,950 --> 03:02:57,070
I would thought they'd get rats like,
well they do generally right environment

3910
03:02:57,250 --> 03:02:59,900
or not marmots moles and stuff.
You'll see the,

3911
03:02:59,901 --> 03:03:02,860
how they jump.
They hear so well they can located under

3912
03:03:02,861 --> 03:03:04,090
the snow.
And Jana.

3913
03:03:04,630 --> 03:03:07,390
Well here's how fucked up.
I had a coyote killed one of my chickens

3914
03:03:07,391 --> 03:03:10,760
recently and I buried the chicken and 
um,

3915
03:03:10,870 --> 03:03:15,870
I was in the yard the other day.
I heard this noise and my golden 

3916
03:03:15,870 --> 03:03:17,980
retriever who has zero killer instinct.

3917
03:03:18,310 --> 03:03:21,250
I mean he'll,
he'll kill a bird or something.

3918
03:03:21,260 --> 03:03:23,680
He gets a hold of it,
but he's not like a guard dog.

3919
03:03:23,710 --> 03:03:25,660
He's a sweetie and he's,
he's like,

3920
03:03:25,661 --> 03:03:28,450
what is going on over there?
And these communities are on the roof of

3921
03:03:28,451 --> 03:03:32,950
the fucking henhouse trying to pry away 
the chicken wire.

3922
03:03:33,250 --> 03:03:38,250
And I hear this clink clink clink clink 
is the kylies biting the chicken wire 

3923
03:03:38,260 --> 03:03:40,180
trying to break it open and get into the
chickens.

3924
03:03:40,840 --> 03:03:42,790
So they killed one chicken.
I chased him off.

3925
03:03:43,710 --> 03:03:45,400
I got a video over there.
I was going to post their bills.

3926
03:03:45,401 --> 03:03:47,500
Like,
this is too gross chicken.

3927
03:03:47,501 --> 03:03:49,540
They got fucked up by this code is plus.
It's sad.

3928
03:03:49,541 --> 03:03:51,070
I love those chickens,
they're like a pet,

3929
03:03:51,090 --> 03:03:53,320
you know,
so I dug a whole bird,

3930
03:03:53,321 --> 03:03:58,321
the chicken and the coyote.
He dunked the fucking hole up and found 

3931
03:03:58,321 --> 03:03:59,930
chicken and it was a couple feet down.

3932
03:04:00,350 --> 03:04:02,420
You know,
it wasn't a super shallow grave.

3933
03:04:02,640 --> 03:04:07,640
I mean that coyote smelled that chicken 
through two feet of dirt and went and 

3934
03:04:08,031 --> 03:04:11,010
dug it out.
I went out there a couple days later and

3935
03:04:11,011 --> 03:04:12,650
I was like,
where's the fucking chicken?

3936
03:04:12,651 --> 03:04:13,790
There's just a hole there.
I was like,

3937
03:04:13,791 --> 03:04:15,830
Whoa,
this is crazy.

3938
03:04:16,430 --> 03:04:18,230
They could smell through the dirt,
man.

3939
03:04:18,800 --> 03:04:22,430
They knew the chicken was down there.
It's crazy.

3940
03:04:22,520 --> 03:04:26,510
That's crazy.
Do you ever have strange experience with

3941
03:04:26,511 --> 03:04:31,511
wild animals while you were tripping?
Never have zero experience with animals 

3942
03:04:31,941 --> 03:04:35,390
while tripping a lot.
Cause I tripped in the woods alone.

3943
03:04:36,050 --> 03:04:36,590
Yeah,
man,

3944
03:04:36,591 --> 03:04:41,330
I know too much about the words.
I want a trip inside of arm compound.

3945
03:04:42,590 --> 03:04:45,200
Well that'll be safe.
Loaded guns nearby.

3946
03:04:46,010 --> 03:04:50,250
A fear fetish.
No,

3947
03:04:50,420 --> 03:04:52,550
almost joking.
Around half of it is for entertainment.

3948
03:04:53,490 --> 03:04:55,640
I've gotten.
I've done mushrooms in a field before.

3949
03:04:56,680 --> 03:05:01,680
It didn't freak me out.
A baseball field when Aubrey and I went 

3950
03:05:01,680 --> 03:05:05,771
bear hunting,
he took mushrooms one of the days I 

3951
03:05:05,771 --> 03:05:05,771
didn't.

3952
03:05:05,771 --> 03:05:05,771
I wasn't with him.
You know,

3953
03:05:05,771 --> 03:05:08,330
when you go to your own little area of 
the woods by yourself,

3954
03:05:08,380 --> 03:05:10,790
I find it hard to shoot anything.
If I were tripping,

3955
03:05:11,090 --> 03:05:12,290
you wouldn't.
If you were hungry.

3956
03:05:12,860 --> 03:05:16,010
The thing about those things is like,
bear hunting is a weird one man,

3957
03:05:16,130 --> 03:05:21,130
because they need to control the 
populations because if they don't 

3958
03:05:21,130 --> 03:05:23,831
control the populations,
the bears decimate the moose and the 

3959
03:05:23,831 --> 03:05:23,990
deer and they eat 50 percent of the Fonz
as it is,

3960
03:05:24,020 --> 03:05:24,710
right.
If,

3961
03:05:24,711 --> 03:05:25,070
uh,
if,

3962
03:05:25,071 --> 03:05:30,071
uh,
although deer populations out of 

3963
03:05:30,071 --> 03:05:30,071
control,
a lot of places,

3964
03:05:30,071 --> 03:05:32,150
not,
not in Alberta have Pennsylvania,

3965
03:05:32,151 --> 03:05:33,950
it's a,
it's a healthy balance,

3966
03:05:34,100 --> 03:05:37,580
but it's only apparently a healthy 
balance according to biologists.

3967
03:05:37,610 --> 03:05:39,290
And it's not according to vegans are 
hunters,

3968
03:05:39,500 --> 03:05:43,190
but according to biologist,
it's only healthy if the bear population

3969
03:05:43,191 --> 03:05:46,040
is kept to a certain number.
If it gets too crazy,

3970
03:05:46,220 --> 03:05:50,300
then they run out of food and then 
there's a lot of cannibalism already,

3971
03:05:50,510 --> 03:05:52,280
but then it gets even worse and you 
know,

3972
03:05:52,281 --> 03:05:55,580
then they start encroaching on cities 
and towns and it gets.

3973
03:05:56,120 --> 03:05:59,970
It gets weird,
but are they treated it in terms of like

3974
03:06:00,080 --> 03:06:05,080
a number thing instead of looking at it 
from a moral standpoint like should you 

3975
03:06:05,080 --> 03:06:05,090
kill an animal?
They.

3976
03:06:05,160 --> 03:06:05,550
They're like,
well,

3977
03:06:05,551 --> 03:06:08,250
if you don't kill an animal,
this animal is overbalanced this,

3978
03:06:08,251 --> 03:06:13,251
that overpopulated,
this animal's going to be under 

3979
03:06:13,251 --> 03:06:13,251
populated now because they're going to 
go after them.

3980
03:06:13,251 --> 03:06:14,060
They get to kill a disproportionate 
number of them,

3981
03:06:14,440 --> 03:06:17,570
so they try to keep this so.
But bears are apex predators.

3982
03:06:17,571 --> 03:06:20,600
So who was killing bears?
Other bears,

3983
03:06:20,930 --> 03:06:24,170
grizzlies.
So then the sort of the ultimate balance

3984
03:06:24,230 --> 03:06:27,050
is to just leave the bears and let the 
other bears kill him.

3985
03:06:27,140 --> 03:06:32,140
That's a good balance.
But then you're living in a world where 

3986
03:06:32,140 --> 03:06:34,310
you have 11 foot 12 foot grizzlies 
everywhere you go wandering into town.

3987
03:06:34,550 --> 03:06:37,580
If you live in a place like Alberta in 
some,

3988
03:06:37,640 --> 03:06:41,060
some areas of Alberta,
you have know good population of elk and

3989
03:06:41,061 --> 03:06:43,760
Moose and deer,
well that means you're gonna have a good

3990
03:06:43,761 --> 03:06:46,640
population of monsters,
so if you're comfortable with that,

3991
03:06:48,960 --> 03:06:52,460
you just have to decide how much risk do
you want to have.

3992
03:06:52,940 --> 03:06:55,190
Because once the bears chew through 
them,

3993
03:06:55,230 --> 03:06:56,760
they're going to go after you.
You should,

3994
03:06:56,880 --> 03:06:58,960
uh,
Boris with the bow.

3995
03:06:59,440 --> 03:07:00,210
Yeah,
I've done that.

3996
03:07:00,260 --> 03:07:00,870
Yeah.
Yeah.

3997
03:07:01,000 --> 03:07:02,830
A friend of mine invited me to go,
uh,

3998
03:07:03,260 --> 03:07:05,700
do that in Hawaii.
Hawaii has to do it.

3999
03:07:05,760 --> 03:07:07,890
It's a good place because of that I 
don't have any predators.

4000
03:07:07,891 --> 03:07:12,891
And they fuck up.
And he was explaining that the boers 

4001
03:07:12,891 --> 03:07:16,521
fuck up the coral reefs because they dig
up all the dirt and then it runs off in 

4002
03:07:16,521 --> 03:07:18,730
the rain and it contaminates the bays 
are.

4003
03:07:18,731 --> 03:07:19,820
That makes sense?
Yeah.

4004
03:07:19,860 --> 03:07:24,860
So it's a really big thing in Hawaii 
that they have to really go after the 

4005
03:07:24,860 --> 03:07:28,110
bars as much as there's a project right 
now in Maui where they,

4006
03:07:28,560 --> 03:07:33,560
they're going to fence in an area and 
the area that they're fenced in,

4007
03:07:33,720 --> 03:07:35,160
they have to.
It's like 5,000

4008
03:07:35,161 --> 03:07:36,000
acres,
I think it is,

4009
03:07:36,240 --> 03:07:41,240
where they have to eradicate the deer 
that are in this one particular area 

4010
03:07:41,240 --> 03:07:44,170
because they're trying to reclaim the 
forest land and a lot of these deer,

4011
03:07:45,030 --> 03:07:50,030
the deer,
most of the large mammals in Hawaii are 

4012
03:07:50,030 --> 03:07:50,820
not native and so these invasive species
is access.

4013
03:07:50,820 --> 03:07:54,480
Deer from Asia actually are just,
they eat everything.

4014
03:07:54,510 --> 03:07:59,510
Nothing gets to grow,
like just getting not going to be a 

4015
03:07:59,510 --> 03:07:59,510
forest because the little things grow 
and they just eat them,

4016
03:07:59,510 --> 03:08:00,270
eat them right when they're coming up 
and they just.

4017
03:08:00,300 --> 03:08:05,300
There's so many of them,
so they also have a problem with people 

4018
03:08:05,300 --> 03:08:06,720
needing food,
so what they're doing is they're like,

4019
03:08:06,780 --> 03:08:11,780
they have this project where they're 
going out and they're hunting these 

4020
03:08:11,780 --> 03:08:13,851
animals,
killing them and giving these food to 

4021
03:08:13,851 --> 03:08:13,851
people for free and so they've set it up
like this.

4022
03:08:13,851 --> 03:08:16,050
So they have a real sustainable food 
source for all these poor people,

4023
03:08:16,200 --> 03:08:18,480
which is the best meat in the world.
So delicious.

4024
03:08:18,481 --> 03:08:21,510
I was going to say much better than 
industrial.

4025
03:08:21,690 --> 03:08:22,620
Sure.
Shit.

4026
03:08:23,200 --> 03:08:24,510
It's really good.
I mean,

4027
03:08:24,511 --> 03:08:29,511
even in terms of wild game animals,
they have the most delicious game 

4028
03:08:29,511 --> 03:08:29,640
animal,
like two thoughts.

4029
03:08:29,670 --> 03:08:32,970
It's usually,
it's either elk or access deer.

4030
03:08:33,000 --> 03:08:34,950
Those are the two to go back and forth.
I've had both.

4031
03:08:34,951 --> 03:08:39,951
They're both amazing.
But access to your are fucking 

4032
03:08:39,951 --> 03:08:39,951
everywhere.
Never had bison.

4033
03:08:39,951 --> 03:08:40,640
You must have.
Yes.

4034
03:08:40,710 --> 03:08:41,530
Yeah,
that's,

4035
03:08:41,570 --> 03:08:42,320
that's.
Yeah,

4036
03:08:42,370 --> 03:08:44,210
free.
Amazing.

4037
03:08:44,580 --> 03:08:47,300
It's amazing.
Cool animal to see in a while.

4038
03:08:47,340 --> 03:08:49,350
You have a star wars around.
Yeah,

4039
03:08:49,410 --> 03:08:50,250
exactly.
Yeah.

4040
03:08:50,251 --> 03:08:52,350
We saw them in yellowstone.
Big Herd of.

4041
03:08:52,351 --> 03:08:57,351
I'm just chilling,
but it was weird because they were so 

4042
03:08:57,351 --> 03:08:58,080
accustomed to people to just lounge in 
like 100 yards from folks.

4043
03:08:58,140 --> 03:09:02,520
Can you imagine like before they shot 
them all that oceans of those things.

4044
03:09:02,521 --> 03:09:04,320
Crazy.
Know where that came from.

4045
03:09:04,321 --> 03:09:06,030
That's another one.
That's a weird one that I didn't know.

4046
03:09:06,031 --> 03:09:08,850
Dan Flores is a fascinating guy.
He wrote a book,

4047
03:09:08,990 --> 03:09:11,670
a great book and coyotes called Coyote 
America,

4048
03:09:12,000 --> 03:09:13,080
but he wrote a,
um,

4049
03:09:13,200 --> 03:09:14,910
a pete.
It was a paper,

4050
03:09:15,540 --> 03:09:17,940
a bison,
diplomacy.

4051
03:09:17,941 --> 03:09:19,560
Bison ecology.
That's the name of it.

4052
03:09:20,210 --> 03:09:25,210
But it's basically saying that what 
happened was when the Europeans came to 

4053
03:09:25,210 --> 03:09:28,851
America and the European spread disease,
it decimated the native American 

4054
03:09:28,851 --> 03:09:33,180
population by as much as 90 percent.
That is when the bison boom happened.

4055
03:09:33,720 --> 03:09:38,160
Bison ecology and bison diplomacy.
The southern plains from 1800 1850.

4056
03:09:38,430 --> 03:09:42,930
So what his,
what his take is that the overpopulation

4057
03:09:42,931 --> 03:09:47,931
of Bison was a direct result of these 
native American people being decimated 

4058
03:09:48,750 --> 03:09:51,060
because their population dropped by 90 
percent.

4059
03:09:51,061 --> 03:09:54,100
No one was hunting the buffalo.
So the buffalo just

4060
03:09:54,100 --> 03:09:59,100
went crazy.
And there's with no hunters chasing 

4061
03:09:59,100 --> 03:09:59,100
after him.
One,

4062
03:09:59,100 --> 03:09:59,680
two,
three decades later,

4063
03:09:59,860 --> 03:10:03,760
you've got a shit ton of Bison says 
running around everywhere.

4064
03:10:04,030 --> 03:10:09,030
And he points to early settlers that 
described in great detail all of the 

4065
03:10:09,431 --> 03:10:11,290
various game animals that they came 
across.

4066
03:10:11,291 --> 03:10:16,291
But nerium mentioned of the Bison and 
certainly not a mention of like these 

4067
03:10:16,291 --> 03:10:19,360
gigantic million strong herds of bison 
roaming the plains.

4068
03:10:19,670 --> 03:10:22,300
Anything that's a direct result of all 
of their predators,

4069
03:10:22,540 --> 03:10:27,540
the native Americans who had got really 
good hunting them and even even surplus,

4070
03:10:27,941 --> 03:10:30,760
letting them where they drive them off 
cliffs and just take what they could.

4071
03:10:30,761 --> 03:10:35,761
That was at the bottom.
Although it's also interesting to think 

4072
03:10:35,761 --> 03:10:37,570
how the introduction of horses would 
have changed everything.

4073
03:10:37,870 --> 03:10:42,870
Horses and guns.
What Dan Flores says that is that just 

4074
03:10:42,870 --> 03:10:42,910
with this,
with why,

4075
03:10:43,060 --> 03:10:48,060
just forget about European settlers.
Just the native Americans with horses 

4076
03:10:48,060 --> 03:10:50,530
and rifles were on their way to extra 
painting the by the Bison.

4077
03:10:51,790 --> 03:10:52,810
Yeah.
Crazy.

4078
03:10:53,200 --> 03:10:54,700
So we,
I mean,

4079
03:10:54,701 --> 03:10:59,701
this does not exonerate all the 
Europeans that had the stacks of bones 

4080
03:10:59,701 --> 03:11:02,140
and that killed them in mass.
They certainly did that.

4081
03:11:02,410 --> 03:11:05,860
There's no doubt about it.
And that's what almost caused the,

4082
03:11:05,900 --> 03:11:07,660
uh,
the complete extinction.

4083
03:11:07,920 --> 03:11:09,430
That's it.
It was at the end.

4084
03:11:09,431 --> 03:11:10,780
It was the Europeans.
It was us,

4085
03:11:10,781 --> 03:11:13,130
the settlers to starve out the Indians.
Yeah.

4086
03:11:13,210 --> 03:11:13,540
Well,
no,

4087
03:11:13,541 --> 03:11:14,610
it wasn't even.
That is,

4088
03:11:14,620 --> 03:11:17,920
that's another thing that they think 
that there was not a concerted effort to

4089
03:11:17,921 --> 03:11:20,260
starve about the Indians.
They wanted it for search for food.

4090
03:11:20,530 --> 03:11:25,530
They wanted the tongues.
What I read is the Buffalo Bill and 

4091
03:11:25,530 --> 03:11:27,100
those dudes were shooting them and just 
leaving the bodies out there.

4092
03:11:27,101 --> 03:11:31,780
It was to wipe out the Lakota because 
they couldn't fucking beat the Lakota.

4093
03:11:31,870 --> 03:11:33,950
That might've been done as well,
but that's not.

4094
03:11:34,080 --> 03:11:36,280
That's not what.
What killed them off.

4095
03:11:36,360 --> 03:11:38,740
I mean when you see these giant stacks 
of skulls,

4096
03:11:39,040 --> 03:11:41,410
they were doing that for using them as a
commodity.

4097
03:11:41,800 --> 03:11:43,900
A lot of it was just for their tongues,
believe it or not.

4098
03:11:44,440 --> 03:11:47,140
Their tongues were very valuable,
valuable delicacy,

4099
03:11:47,141 --> 03:11:49,890
and then it was for their skins and you 
know when they.

4100
03:11:50,640 --> 03:11:53,920
They had meat hunting.
They had what they called market hunting

4101
03:11:54,040 --> 03:11:57,430
where they take guys who came back from 
the war and they were looking for a job,

4102
03:11:57,431 --> 03:11:59,290
but one of the best jobs and get,
are you good shot?

4103
03:11:59,470 --> 03:12:01,090
Great.
You can be a hunter,

4104
03:12:01,330 --> 03:12:03,610
and they would go and shoot fucking 
everything.

4105
03:12:03,640 --> 03:12:07,060
Everything that moved and they wiped out
all the antelope,

4106
03:12:07,500 --> 03:12:08,260
elk,
all the.

4107
03:12:08,440 --> 03:12:13,440
It wasn't just the bison,
it's just the bison is such an iconic 

4108
03:12:13,440 --> 03:12:15,820
thing and then obviously those piles of 
skulls,

4109
03:12:15,821 --> 03:12:20,821
it was unusual.
The amount of effort they put into 

4110
03:12:20,821 --> 03:12:23,700
killing them,
but I don't think it was necessarily 

4111
03:12:23,700 --> 03:12:25,000
just to just to wipe out them so that 
the native Americans would star.

4112
03:12:25,090 --> 03:12:28,300
I'm sure they did that locally and bury 
my heart at wounded knee.

4113
03:12:29,560 --> 03:12:30,430
No,
I don't think I did.

4114
03:12:30,460 --> 03:12:35,460
It's a beautiful book.
It's really interesting book about the 

4115
03:12:35,460 --> 03:12:38,850
sort of final chapter of different 
tribes in North America,

4116
03:12:39,700 --> 03:12:44,700
Jeronimo and the Apaches and sitting 
bull and all these people and it's just 

4117
03:12:44,831 --> 03:12:49,831
really interesting the story of the sort
of contact and the characters and the 

4118
03:12:49,831 --> 03:12:51,950
different things that happen.
Yeah.

4119
03:12:51,951 --> 03:12:52,040
I

4120
03:12:52,040 --> 03:12:55,430
read that when I was very young when I 
was running around in a loin cloth,

4121
03:12:55,940 --> 03:12:58,480
throwing apples at rabbits.
That is,

4122
03:12:58,580 --> 03:13:01,310
if you look at human history,
what is this here?

4123
03:13:02,150 --> 03:13:03,380
They used to shoot them from.
From.

4124
03:13:04,100 --> 03:13:05,000
From trains.
Yeah.

4125
03:13:05,180 --> 03:13:06,360
They did it for fun too.
Yeah.

4126
03:13:07,070 --> 03:13:08,270
Crazy.
Yeah.

4127
03:13:08,660 --> 03:13:13,660
There were so many of them.
They just thought they could just shoot 

4128
03:13:13,660 --> 03:13:13,660
them.
What else?

4129
03:13:13,660 --> 03:13:15,470
What our relationship with the natural 
world that represents,

4130
03:13:15,471 --> 03:13:20,471
you know,
well this is what I was going to say is 

4131
03:13:20,471 --> 03:13:22,241
like,
has there ever been anything like that 

4132
03:13:22,241 --> 03:13:25,600
other than I mean anything in terms of 
the impact of a group of people landing 

4133
03:13:26,871 --> 03:13:29,960
on a continent like nothing that we've 
ever observed,

4134
03:13:29,990 --> 03:13:33,470
so the greatest mortality in history for
sure and did great.

4135
03:13:33,471 --> 03:13:38,471
It's changed to like not only that but 
this weird movement to the west and like

4136
03:13:39,890 --> 03:13:44,890
landing landing on this weird continent 
that was filled with these people that 

4137
03:13:45,471 --> 03:13:47,120
lived in a completely different way.

4138
03:13:47,360 --> 03:13:52,360
I mean,
what are the odds that you're going to 

4139
03:13:52,360 --> 03:13:52,820
get to a place you think of where Europe
was in the 17 hundreds,

4140
03:13:52,910 --> 03:13:54,850
the 14 hundreds,
you know,

4141
03:13:54,860 --> 03:13:59,860
when the first started arriving and 
think of the sophistication with the 

4142
03:13:59,860 --> 03:14:00,980
boats and the written language and all 
the different things,

4143
03:14:01,190 --> 03:14:06,190
and then they show up,
go across the ocean and land to a place 

4144
03:14:06,190 --> 03:14:06,940
that has zero cities.
No,

4145
03:14:06,950 --> 03:14:09,020
there were cities to.
The land was.

4146
03:14:09,110 --> 03:14:12,080
Was bigger than almost all European 
cities.

4147
03:14:12,081 --> 03:14:15,890
When Cortez walked into it,
that's in Mexico.

4148
03:14:15,891 --> 03:14:20,480
That's where the Aztecs were.
They also had sewage and lit streets.

4149
03:14:20,580 --> 03:14:22,850
They did more in South America and North
America,

4150
03:14:22,851 --> 03:14:23,240
right?
Yeah.

4151
03:14:23,270 --> 03:14:24,320
No,
nor from.

4152
03:14:24,380 --> 03:14:25,910
I mean,
you're talking about America,

4153
03:14:25,911 --> 03:14:30,911
Canada.
There was nothing comparable at that 

4154
03:14:30,911 --> 03:14:30,911
point,
but that's what I meant.

4155
03:14:30,911 --> 03:14:34,560
I mean,
like when they're landing here and they 

4156
03:14:34,560 --> 03:14:34,560
made their way all the way to 
California,

4157
03:14:34,560 --> 03:14:35,390
they're not encountering a single city.

4158
03:14:35,420 --> 03:14:36,290
Right?
I mean,

4159
03:14:36,291 --> 03:14:41,291
that's just fucking bananas.
You've got thousands of miles of just 

4160
03:14:41,291 --> 03:14:43,010
natural people living in tents.
Yeah,

4161
03:14:43,011 --> 03:14:43,820
no,
crazy.

4162
03:14:43,840 --> 03:14:48,840
Do you ever sleep in a teepee?
Now this place in Terlingua stating the 

4163
03:14:48,840 --> 03:14:50,270
teepee.
Jeff Microbiology Guy,

4164
03:14:50,271 --> 03:14:52,460
he's got a bunch of,
or microbiome guy.

4165
03:14:52,760 --> 03:14:54,860
He's got a bunch of teepees.
They like luxury,

4166
03:14:54,861 --> 03:14:56,720
beautiful teepees,
luxury teepees.

4167
03:14:56,750 --> 03:14:58,610
Fucking gray.
That's a luxury tp,

4168
03:14:59,120 --> 03:15:01,070
uh,
Jamie base.

4169
03:15:01,071 --> 03:15:06,071
Camp Terlingua.
You'll see fucking beautiful base camp 

4170
03:15:06,071 --> 03:15:09,560
and Terlingua t e R L I n g u a 
Terlingua.

4171
03:15:09,950 --> 03:15:11,690
It's uh,
yeah,

4172
03:15:11,691 --> 03:15:12,960
they're,
they're fucking sweet there.

4173
03:15:12,980 --> 03:15:17,980
They've got like a concrete base and 
maybe a three foot wall around it.

4174
03:15:17,991 --> 03:15:20,870
And then the teepees on top so the wind 
doesn't blow around.

4175
03:15:21,400 --> 03:15:24,290
And then he showed me the design of tbs 
is really interesting.

4176
03:15:24,291 --> 03:15:27,460
It's like they're designed so the wind 
comes under the teepee,

4177
03:15:27,630 --> 03:15:31,580
have that dope.
They rent those out.

4178
03:15:31,640 --> 03:15:32,390
Yeah.
Oh,

4179
03:15:32,420 --> 03:15:37,420
this is crazy.
We offer once of a kind one of a kind 

4180
03:15:37,420 --> 03:15:40,930
experience without massive 26 foot tp 
over the top of a sunken Kiva.

4181
03:15:41,240 --> 03:15:45,800
What's a Kiva?
Kiva is like a Hopi dwelling that's semi

4182
03:15:46,190 --> 03:15:51,190
submerged.
Each of our three luxury hold each of 

4183
03:15:51,190 --> 03:15:51,660
three luxury.
TPS has a comfy,

4184
03:15:52,080 --> 03:15:54,300
comfy king size bed.
Fold out couch.

4185
03:15:54,330 --> 03:15:57,870
Plenty of seating rubs throughout.
Sink under counter fridge.

4186
03:15:58,000 --> 03:16:00,720
Keurig coffee maker,
the microwave.

4187
03:16:01,140 --> 03:16:04,950
Microwave popcorn outdoor fire pit,
I think outdoors.

4188
03:16:04,980 --> 03:16:06,110
One word there,
isn't it?

4189
03:16:08,760 --> 03:16:10,980
And house a private bath.
House private.

4190
03:16:11,120 --> 03:16:15,420
Hey Jeff,
get with the CISO mountains.

4191
03:16:15,870 --> 03:16:17,550
It's a beautiful area.
Is it?

4192
03:16:17,551 --> 03:16:19,170
Looks like it,
man.

4193
03:16:19,171 --> 03:16:20,700
That looks bad ass.
Nice.

4194
03:16:20,940 --> 03:16:22,430
Wow.
I slept in both of those.

4195
03:16:22,680 --> 03:16:23,940
That's cool.
One hundred year old.

4196
03:16:24,150 --> 03:16:27,300
Hold on Jim.
A rebuilt this rule.

4197
03:16:27,510 --> 03:16:28,610
One hundred year old.
Ruined.

4198
03:16:28,611 --> 03:16:31,140
Located in the heart of Terlingua ghost 
town.

4199
03:16:31,320 --> 03:16:33,900
Wow,
that's amazing too.

4200
03:16:33,910 --> 03:16:35,160
We gotta wrap this up,
right?

4201
03:16:35,400 --> 03:16:38,280
I got to Piss on your source.
I'm sure you do.

4202
03:16:38,580 --> 03:16:40,320
Tangentially reading.
It's out now.

4203
03:16:40,350 --> 03:16:45,350
Anybody can get it everywhere,
all the places that they sell books and 

4204
03:16:45,350 --> 03:16:49,320
of course tangentially speaking places 
you get podcasts is this,

4205
03:16:49,321 --> 03:16:51,540
man.
I'm glad you did this.

4206
03:16:51,541 --> 03:16:55,620
I'm glad you became a podcast guy.
The podcast world is richer for it.

4207
03:16:55,650 --> 03:16:56,160
Well,
thank you.

4208
03:16:56,230 --> 03:16:57,690
I appreciate it.
I'm richer for it.

4209
03:16:57,691 --> 03:16:59,220
Thanks to you and Duncan,
Chris,

4210
03:16:59,221 --> 03:17:01,740

See you guys tomorrow.

4211
03:17:01,770 --> 03:17:02,160
Bye.
