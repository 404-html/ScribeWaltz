1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:02,550
I was out there,
have the answer,

2
00:00:02,551 --> 00:00:06,540
a real solid answer for the tail summons
for.

3
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:10,440
Isn't that weird that Bj would,
would not have a guard like that,

4
00:00:10,441 --> 00:00:12,190
that he wouldn't have this Ninja 
assassin guard?

5
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:14,030
Yeah,
yeah,

6
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:15,840
yeah.
Like you know why?

7
00:00:15,841 --> 00:00:17,580
Because he didn't.
I and I,

8
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:19,980
and I would say this,
I mean I've told this to Bj,

9
00:00:19,981 --> 00:00:20,760
tell him like,
you know what,

10
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:25,910
if you stay at 55,
there's really no reason to master any 

11
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:25,910
kind of guard.
Just get back up.

12
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:27,540
You're fucking ever be better than 
everybody standing up.

13
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:31,290
Nobody at 55 can take you down.
Even big wrestlers can't take you down.

14
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:36,530
I even thought he doesn't need a.
He doesn't really need to focus on his 

15
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:36,530
car.
I thought he didn't need to develop an.

16
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:41,310
I really didn't even know it was 
interested in the rubber guard and he 

17
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:41,940
fucks with it a little bit,
you know what I mean?

18
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:46,940
But he,
I'm sure he felt like no one's going to 

19
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:46,940
put me on my fucking back,
but maybe now,

20
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:51,770
now that he knows like shit,
these fighters are getting so much 

21
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:51,810
better and there's so many wrestlers out
there,

22
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:57,020
you really have to have the answer for 
Chael Sonnen and for like Frankie Edgar 

23
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:57,750
and framing.
Yeah,

24
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:00,570
for these elite wrestling.
What he did to Florian,

25
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:05,410
he took him down and got on top.
When they talk about your garden,

26
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,460
the only answer for,
for the elite wrestler,

27
00:01:08,461 --> 00:01:11,400
and they're all,
they're all over the top 10 of every UFC

28
00:01:11,401 --> 00:01:13,590
weight division.
The only aunts or one of the only.

29
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:18,090
There's only a couple of answers and one
of them is having a.

30
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:20,310
When they talk about your guard,
they don't say that.

31
00:01:20,311 --> 00:01:25,311
It's just a man.
He's got an okay guard at a decent 

32
00:01:25,311 --> 00:01:25,311
guard.
They have to say,

33
00:01:25,311 --> 00:01:26,870
your guard is a fucking amazing,
like don't go in his garden.

34
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,260
Your Garden has to be like Ryan Hall.
Your guard has to be Shinier Yolk.

35
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:35,280
You don't want to fucking be in your 
flag raid like Anthony Pettis and Shane 

36
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,140
Roller.
When Anthony Pettis slapped on that 

37
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:39,140
trial,
exactly.

38
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:39,300
You have to have a super dangerous car.
If they are not.

39
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,380
If people don't talk about your guard 
like it's amazing and it's fucking crazy

40
00:01:43,381 --> 00:01:44,190
wicked,
and they.

41
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:46,770
It's one of the best guards in your 
division,

42
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,040
then you're not good enough.
You don't have the answer for the elite 

43
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,240
wrestler most of the time.
Sometimes you throw up a,

44
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:53,590
a,
a,

45
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:58,800
you know a pop triangle and it lands 
like Anderson Silva made it work in the 

46
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:03,081
fifth round.
I'm Chris Leben made that pop triangle 

47
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:04,740
work and you know the Nogueira style of 
triangle at work that works.

48
00:02:04,741 --> 00:02:08,730
It does work,
but not at the highest rate.

49
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:14,300
You know there's,
there's a lot of the things that you 

50
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:14,300
could do as well to add to that already 
game,

51
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,390
you know,
to those Nogueira triangles,

52
00:02:15,391 --> 00:02:16,620
you could mix it all up.

53
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:19,800
There's a lot of things you can do.
Just look at what Shinya Aoki has done.

54
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:23,400
Look at what Dustin Hayzlett has done.
Look at what Matt Horwitz has done.

55
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,500
Just pay attention.
It's out there.

56
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,590
You can watch it on youtube.
You can do it too.

57
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:32,970
You need to have the answer for the 
elite wrestler and man,

58
00:02:32,971 --> 00:02:36,000
having a crazy wicked guard can be the 
answer.

59
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:39,680
What is the image name?
Tony and I ran into James.

60
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:42,320
Tony,
it's amazing that you lived in.

61
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:46,240
You know,
I was pulling for him at first.

62
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:48,370
Well,
I thought that box.

63
00:02:48,371 --> 00:02:51,310
I thought that these MMA guys really 
didn't know these.

64
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:54,190
When you're a boxer in you're that high 
rate of a boxer,

65
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:55,600
you know,
you really don't know.

66
00:02:55,601 --> 00:02:59,120
These guys get hit and their hands and 
that the timing of this shit.

67
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,110
But when I watched the countdown was 
when I was like,

68
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,340
he didn't work.

69
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:09,150
He didn't work.
He got a great opportunity to represent 

70
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:09,150
boxing,
but he didn't work.

71
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:10,960
You don't think you've worked out.
I lost a lot of weight.

72
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:14,290
He lost 15 pounds a month.
Okay.

73
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,540
If you're rolling,
Eddie,

74
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:19,180
student law 60 in a couple months.
If you're really fucking roll.

75
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:21,790
Let's say you take this guy on,
you got four months,

76
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,590
the first month or you're doing with 
them.

77
00:03:23,591 --> 00:03:25,210
You're not working his hands.
They're already there.

78
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:29,700
So you're basically working and getting 
up and just rolling little things.

79
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:33,460
Just surviving on my back right there.
All those things are bad.

80
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,350
You know what?
I used to go to judo when I was a kid.

81
00:03:35,351 --> 00:03:38,750
I was skinny as shit because the hardest
thing about judo is flipping.

82
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:41,440
It's every time you get up and down,
you get up and down.

83
00:03:41,441 --> 00:03:45,010
50 Times a day that you get skinny.
This guy didn't do that.

84
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:47,450
He got some guy from the FBI to come in 
and train them.

85
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:49,210
You know what the fuck?
They go,

86
00:03:49,211 --> 00:03:51,890
Oh,
you know I'm in.

87
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,940
I'm in.
I'm in Hollywood with Ladell.

88
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:56,140
I'm rolling.
I'm rolling with Einstein.

89
00:03:56,141 --> 00:03:58,030
I'm learning the basics.
How to Bro?

90
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:59,530
What?
How much can I learn?

91
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:02,530
And four months to get me out of a mess.
That's what I'm learning.

92
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,030
He didn't know any better.
You didn't know.

93
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,780
He didn't know where.
He got a guy from the FBI that God knows

94
00:04:06,781 --> 00:04:10,720
that they fucking paid up.
One was the guy who trained him to Kenpo

95
00:04:10,721 --> 00:04:15,721
videos of him online,
like Campo with guys that come behind 

96
00:04:15,721 --> 00:04:17,650
him and cut his legs and stuff and the 
guy was trained,

97
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:19,900
James Tony that's on the underground.
I say James.

98
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,220
Tony actually doing it.
Well,

99
00:04:21,221 --> 00:04:21,880
I mean he,
you know,

100
00:04:21,881 --> 00:04:23,740
he looked the guy set up a program for 
him,

101
00:04:23,741 --> 00:04:25,000
but what does the guy know for real?

102
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:30,240
You know,
what he really needed to do is go to 

103
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:30,240
Colorado Springs and train at the 
Olympic training center.

104
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,900
He needed to get a guy who's a fucking 
Jujitsu master to come with them.

105
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:33,430
Okay,
these guys are going to take you down.

106
00:04:33,431 --> 00:04:34,960
He going to do your best to stop,
to take down.

107
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,330
Then once they get you taken down,
then you're going to work at guard.

108
00:04:37,331 --> 00:04:42,331
That's what you need to get down and try
to submit those bureau a motherfucking 

109
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:50,410
daily basis.
When I watch the countdown show,

110
00:04:50,411 --> 00:04:53,080
what was very clear to me is that the 
guys who was working out with,

111
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:56,080
we're letting him do things for the 
camera and that it was.

112
00:04:56,081 --> 00:04:58,670
They weren't elite grapplers.
They were letting him do things like,

113
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,360
I was like,
ah.

114
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:02,590
It was a demonstration,
like anytime you change roles all over,

115
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:03,100
like,
ah,

116
00:05:03,101 --> 00:05:04,030
I can't believe he's doing this.

117
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,620
It's like they were like letting him do 
it.

118
00:05:05,621 --> 00:05:07,750
They're putting on a show and letting 
james throw them around.

119
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,250
I was like,
this is silly.

120
00:05:09,251 --> 00:05:14,251
I'm like,
he might not know anything about 

121
00:05:14,251 --> 00:05:16,141
grappling.
There was this dude that found Hobby 

122
00:05:16,141 --> 00:05:16,141
Vasquez back at my first king of the 
cage show in 2000.

123
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:18,970
He comes out in claims,
he's a Brazilian jujitsu black belt.

124
00:05:18,971 --> 00:05:22,420
He's this French karate guy,
and he thought back then he just started

125
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:24,340
like,
you could just say shit like that.

126
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:26,110
And so he said,
I'll take the.

127
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,380
He said he's been training Jujitsu 12 
years and he's a black belt under hoists

128
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:34,410
gracie.
That's what he was telling Carrie 

129
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:34,410
trouble cock.
And Terry's got,

130
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:34,690
I think we've got a live one here.
He calls the police Gracie Academy.

131
00:05:34,691 --> 00:05:36,220
They never heard of the guy.
The guy's bullshitting.

132
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:39,580
He's trying to scare harvey into going 
to the ground with them.

133
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:41,170
And Hobby was a purple belt.
But uh,

134
00:05:41,171 --> 00:05:45,400
did Matt destroyer on the local southern
California scene,

135
00:05:45,401 --> 00:05:48,040
he would've gone to Santa Santa Cruz as 
well and smash.

136
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:53,250
He was the fucking destroyer of the 
purple belts division and there wasn't 

137
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:57,181
very many browns and blacks at that 
point and he was going to go against 

138
00:05:57,181 --> 00:05:58,100
this guy who claimed to be a black belt 
dude habit.

139
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:00,960
Took them down and like the guy had no 
training dude,

140
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:06,130
zero has used,
just laid flat on his back and he tap 

141
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:06,470
really crooked hobby powder in them a 
couple of times.

142
00:06:06,471 --> 00:06:07,670
He just kept and it was over.
It's like,

143
00:06:07,671 --> 00:06:10,670
what the fuck was that?
That's an interesting story,

144
00:06:10,671 --> 00:06:15,671
but a much more interesting story is the
other guy that we know that claim to be 

145
00:06:15,671 --> 00:06:19,211
a Brazilian jujitsu black belt that 
really didn't know anything that turned 

146
00:06:19,211 --> 00:06:19,211
out to be a murderer.

147
00:06:19,211 --> 00:06:19,230
Yes.
Yeah.

148
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:22,890
There was a dude we knew his,
his fake name was Raphael Tory.

149
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:24,740
But his real name,
what was his real name?

150
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:26,780
Damn,
I don't remember.

151
00:06:26,781 --> 00:06:28,820
But he told people he,
uh,

152
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:33,880
he taught karate karate his whole life 
and he taught karate and he told people 

153
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:34,760
he was a black belt in Brazilian 
Jujitsu,

154
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:37,490
but this Guy Eddie was hanging around 
with this guy.

155
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:40,580
He was doing Brazilian.
He said it was a website,

156
00:06:40,581 --> 00:06:41,700
right?
He was.

157
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,700
No,
he was a writer.

158
00:06:43,701 --> 00:06:48,701
He was probably one of the most popular 
journalists back down on the 

159
00:06:48,701 --> 00:06:52,091
underground.
I mean Ralph El Toro was all over the 

160
00:06:52,091 --> 00:06:52,091
underground.
It was 2000.

161
00:06:52,091 --> 00:06:56,170
It was still in the dark ages,
so it wasn't easy for a guy to bust up 

162
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:57,650
and he was on speed all the time.
I didn't know this until years later.

163
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:02,680
So he would work hard.
She would always have shit and pride 

164
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:02,680
loved them.

165
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:02,810
He always had reports.
He always had interviews.

166
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:04,640
He was always,
oh dude,

167
00:07:04,641 --> 00:07:07,910
he was probably one of the top three 
riders in Alabama.

168
00:07:07,911 --> 00:07:10,080
And I remember he was very productive 
and he would do.

169
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:13,490
He was doing his version of Gonzo 
journalism for MMA,

170
00:07:13,491 --> 00:07:15,860
like asking MMA fighters if they like 
anal sex.

171
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:18,880
I just like being real crazy.
That was my shift.

172
00:07:18,881 --> 00:07:22,910
So it turned out that this dude wasn't 
really a black belt at all and um,

173
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:24,230
we,
we,

174
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,210
you know,
it wasn't half Brazilian.

175
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:26,890
Yeah.
It was like,

176
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:31,930
it was all crazy.
We were driving and Eddie had this 

177
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:32,000
confrontation with them on the phone.
To make a long story short,

178
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:36,530
homeboy winds up killing some dudes 
strangling him to death.

179
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:41,710
The husband of this chick that he's 
banging and he winds up going to jail 

180
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:42,830
for it.
When he was,

181
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:43,840
he was a murderer.
He,

182
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:45,820
he,
he got this guy insurance.

183
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:46,860
Medicaid.
Yeah.

184
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:48,800
Yeah.
The,

185
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:51,170
uh,
the wife of this guy that he strangled,

186
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,330
you know,
so they,

187
00:07:52,331 --> 00:07:57,331
they decided to set this up and he 
choked the guy to death until the guy 

188
00:07:57,331 --> 00:07:58,790
with a real naked choice.
How ironic is it?

189
00:07:58,791 --> 00:08:03,791
That is black belt wasn't legit,
but he killed someone with a rear naked 

190
00:08:03,791 --> 00:08:06,110
choke.
A Guy,

191
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:09,900
poor guy killed in a trained at all and 
probably didn't even see it coming.

192
00:08:09,901 --> 00:08:11,790
I just jumped up and choke the shit out 
of him.

193
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:16,970
Can You Imagine Matt Madman,
your fucking wife as banging some other 

194
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:20,291
dude?
That dude comes to your house and kills 

195
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:20,291
you.
It didn't go to his house,

196
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:23,380
he's lured him into Jim and I testified 
on that trial.

197
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,040
Did you really had to go to court and 
just finger,

198
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:29,390
um,
and they called me.

199
00:08:29,391 --> 00:08:34,391
They called me.
The cops called me because I called 

200
00:08:34,391 --> 00:08:34,430
Gerald wants and when I was talking to 
Gerald on the phone,

201
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:37,250
the phone was being tapped and Gerald 
and I are talking about,

202
00:08:37,251 --> 00:08:37,820
you know,
his,

203
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:42,830
uh,
possibility to him fight in the UFC who 

204
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:45,540
is,
you want to fight this Napa and Rafael 

205
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:45,860
Torres name comes up and I'm like,
what's going on with that dude?

206
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:50,860
And so Jerald was being tapped and he 
was talking all these different people 

207
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:50,860
about it.
And then,

208
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:51,140
you know,
the,

209
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,760
everybody that he talked to on the 
phone,

210
00:08:52,761 --> 00:08:55,290
they had to talk to the cops.
But I didn't really know anything.

211
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:57,150
I didn't know the guy.
I just knew the guys ready.

212
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:00,870
Fortunately I want to fucking go to 
court about that.

213
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:02,580
Yeah.
So what'd you have to say?

214
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,170
Yeah,
that guy's a fake.

215
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,800
He's a liar.
Basically.

216
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:11,760
I forget the questions they made me ask,
but I hung out with that.

217
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:15,120
Like he was always brought in on 
whatever show I was commentating,

218
00:09:15,121 --> 00:09:18,270
whether it was king of the cage or pride
or even a too hot to handle.

219
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:21,990
He was always the reporter who's going 
to blow up the handle was in Holland,

220
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:24,480
right?
Boss Man,

221
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:26,680
boss Dude.
And he was,

222
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:29,010
he was so busy.
He was so amped up on speed.

223
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:32,880
He always had articles and to blow up 
shows you bring Rafael Torah and they'll

224
00:09:32,881 --> 00:09:34,330
blow it all up.
All over the Internet.

225
00:09:34,331 --> 00:09:35,250
Right?
Always on speed.

226
00:09:35,251 --> 00:09:36,590
Huh?
How'd you find out?

227
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:40,260
He was always on speed.
It came out later on the trial.

228
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:43,380
Do you know I'm already took a uh,
what is it called?

229
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:44,790
Adderall.
Took an adderall.

230
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:47,040
Says is the fucking greatest thing ever 
for getting things done.

231
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:49,000
He said it just cleaned out.
The speed did.

232
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:50,650
Yeah.
But what is it?

233
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,710
Why is it speed can help you get 
organized?

234
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:55,080
How does that work?
How does it give you fucking energy?

235
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:57,450
What the fuck?
You feel like you could do anything?

236
00:09:57,451 --> 00:09:58,710
You just want to paint the fucking 
house.

237
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:02,130
You want to go to college?
It's to fucking Louisiana.

238
00:10:02,131 --> 00:10:04,890
You know what I mean?
Is it bad for you?

239
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:06,450
Is it bad for you?
Come on.

240
00:10:06,451 --> 00:10:07,540
It's gotta be it's gotTa be right.

241
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,450
What comes up must come down.
Right?

242
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:11,540
Anything that speeds you out.
It's got to be bad.

243
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:13,830
That's like super,
but it's not just super speeds you out.

244
00:10:13,831 --> 00:10:16,170
It makes me like really organized.
Robert told me once,

245
00:10:16,171 --> 00:10:21,171
he took one accidentally and he said he 
just started organizing all of his 

246
00:10:21,171 --> 00:10:23,931
notes.
Just that's what happens when you add 

247
00:10:23,931 --> 00:10:25,750
speed to think that you could use that 
though as a tool if you could really 

248
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:29,370
make sure you didn't do too much of it 
and didn't fuck up your whole system and

249
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:35,030
short circuit everything like every now 
and then when you knew that the problem 

250
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:38,400
as you come down so hard that you want 
more to come down from adderall.

251
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:41,280
I don't know about adderall but anything
speeding usually goes up.

252
00:10:41,281 --> 00:10:44,800
Comes down hard on it every day.
Are you,

253
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:45,840
what does he say?
Buddies.

254
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:47,670
He said he loves it and it helps them 
organize.

255
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:49,740
Helps them work and he's pretty fucking 
ambitious.

256
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,030
He's,
he's a hard worker,

257
00:10:51,031 --> 00:10:56,031
but he said he was just really listless 
and couldn't get anything going on and 

258
00:10:56,031 --> 00:10:59,571
you know,
and they got them on the adderall and 

259
00:10:59,571 --> 00:10:59,571
then pam just couldn't focus and 
concentrate on things.

260
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:01,630
He just had a hard time committing to 
things and concentrating.

261
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:06,950
Maybe it works different than speed 
because speed somehow I don't know how 

262
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:11,031
it works really well by Athena speed and
that's the fuel of the capitalist 

263
00:11:11,031 --> 00:11:11,760
society and I mean look,
we're the,

264
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:17,280
we're the,
we're the people who drink coffee 

265
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:17,280
everyday.
We have a,

266
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,910
in every union contract they have to 
negotiate a time where you could take a 

267
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:20,520
drug.
There's a fucking coffee break,

268
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:25,670
you know,
and union contracts have coffee break 

269
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:25,670
time.
What does the coffee break cover?

270
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:26,040
Break was your work.
It's fucking 11:00

271
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,000
AM.
It's not quite launched yet.

272
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:32,210
Coffee truck pulls up and you get a 
chance to take fucking five slash 10 

273
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:33,810
minutes off and fuel up on some,
some stimulants.

274
00:11:33,811 --> 00:11:35,220
It's good for the company.
You come back,

275
00:11:35,221 --> 00:11:37,050
I'll jazz and charged and you feel 
better.

276
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,460
You work harder,
you feel better,

277
00:11:38,461 --> 00:11:40,170
and you feel like you got another little
break.

278
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:40,900
You know,
that's,

279
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:43,650
that's union things is one thing they 
figured out that was smart.

280
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:44,640
You know,
look,

281
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:48,180
everybody doesn't have to be a slave.
Like people will like go against unions.

282
00:11:48,181 --> 00:11:53,181
The unions fuck up business and they 
don't work hard and they make too much 

283
00:11:53,181 --> 00:11:55,000
money and blah blah blah.
They make work easier and that's good.

284
00:11:55,110 --> 00:12:00,110
All right.
It's not good to have people work like 

285
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:00,110
fucking slaves.
You know?

286
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:00,340
Wouldn't it be better if they got a 
little bit less done?

287
00:12:00,341 --> 00:12:02,290
But everybody was more happy when that'd
be better.

288
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:07,420
They get a nice coffee break and get to 
relax for an hour for lunch where they 

289
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:07,420
don't feel like they're getting tortured
all day.

290
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:09,250
You know?
Maybe if they got some shit to do during

291
00:12:09,251 --> 00:12:14,251
lunch,
they can go somewhere and fucking pay a 

292
00:12:14,251 --> 00:12:14,251
bill or you know,
pick up the fucking thing that they were

293
00:12:14,251 --> 00:12:18,931
supposed to buy fast.
Do those hours go by God damn that our 

294
00:12:18,931 --> 00:12:23,011
break our breaking shit.
Talking about coffee break is a smoke 

295
00:12:23,011 --> 00:12:24,820
break.
Get outta here.

296

Josie.
Twenty $100.

297
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:31,160
It is and it's fucking joe job does 
podcast two to 4:20.

298
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:33,420
That's the moon going there.
We got to respect this fourth one that I

299
00:12:33,421 --> 00:12:35,230
got shit to do with people who see.
You know what I'm saying?

300
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,850
I'm doing this next one.
No one.

301
00:12:36,851 --> 00:12:39,880
I didn't even fucking thank the pot.
The fleshlight for sponsoring this.

302
00:12:39,881 --> 00:12:43,090
So we're doing this next Wednesday,
next Wednesday.

303
00:12:43,091 --> 00:12:44,860
Doing this as,
as often as we can.

304
00:12:44,861 --> 00:12:46,360
And uh,
as this fucking.

305
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:51,390
This camera sucks man.
I got a camera that it autofocuses and 

306
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:51,390
so are,
you know,

307
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:53,080
you gotta move before it goes into focus
again.

308
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:58,320
All right.
We'd like to take the flesh the 

309
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:58,320
flashlight.
Fuck your hand.

310
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,651
No more.
Fuck the fleshlight why fuck your hands 

311
00:13:01,651 --> 00:13:02,620
that worn out after 18 years.
Give them a fucking break.

312
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,970
Work your muffler with that.
You could fuck the flashlight.

313
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:06,490
Straight up.
It comes in colors.

314
00:13:06,491 --> 00:13:07,660
What's the website?
Joe Rogan.

315
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:10,090
Fleshlight.com.
And listen,

316
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:12,430
Joey's not even speaking to the voice of
experience.

317
00:13:12,431 --> 00:13:13,540
I personally had fucked.
Well,

318
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:16,080
I've never fucked the flashlight.
Fleshlight fleshlight.

319
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:17,950
Eddie Bravo is fucked one.
Yeah,

320
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:18,730
I've had one.
What?

321
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:21,110
I've had like a fake flashlights.
I've had this thought.

322
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:22,390
I'm tele.
When you do it like this,

323
00:13:22,391 --> 00:13:25,360
then you roll it like this.
It's kind of like a fucking flashlight.

324
00:13:25,361 --> 00:13:29,410
So 71 cock suck and I use it on camera.
People on twitter,

325
00:13:29,411 --> 00:13:31,210
please stop sending me the video of the 
chimp.

326
00:13:31,211 --> 00:13:33,550
Fucking the monkey.
Like it's a flush or the monkey.

327
00:13:33,551 --> 00:13:34,090
A fucking.

328
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:36,370
The restaurant is probably better than a
front.

329
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:41,400
Yeah.
Do we need to get those chimps frogs to 

330
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,160
where the frog feels awesome.
What did you do it?

331
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:42,970
No,
no,

332
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:44,410
no,
no.

333
00:13:44,411 --> 00:13:49,411
I don't want to.
I don't want to fuck a frog and it 

334
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:49,930
didn't kill them.
Maybe a deep throats it.

335
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,460
Have you seen the size of their fucking 
throats?

336
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:54,460
Have you ever seen that?
There's a girl I deep throat.com.

337
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:57,340
I think her name is heather.
She's like famous online for her ability

338
00:13:57,341 --> 00:13:59,620
to swallow cock.
It's always her husband's cock.

339
00:13:59,621 --> 00:14:02,950
Like it's always like he films her 
sucking his dick all over the world,

340
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:07,980
right in bathrooms everywhere and she 
just goes straight down to the boss and 

341
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:11,481
you guys got a big deck.
She goes straight down the balls and 

342
00:14:11,481 --> 00:14:11,481
just look at his balls while his dick 
just disappears in her mouth.

343
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,900
But the problem is you see a girl like 
that in video.

344
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:16,120
Totally sets up your expectations way 
too high.

345
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:18,040
How?
How many chicks can do that?

346
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:20,090
And she sponsored by fleshlight.
No,

347
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:22,390
that's the bits that should be now.
Why did it?

348
00:14:22,391 --> 00:14:23,680
She's.
She's a human flashlight.

349
00:14:23,681 --> 00:14:28,681
You don't.
You can't get to anybody until she gets 

350
00:14:28,681 --> 00:14:28,681
to your town.
Use the flashlight.

351
00:14:28,681 --> 00:14:30,250
That's right.
What love you?

352
00:14:30,251 --> 00:14:32,040
Cock size anyway.
You're not going to.

353
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,240
If you go to a fleshlight.com,
there's a link.

354
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:37,300
If you go to Joe Rogan Dutton,
that supposedly if you go off that link,

355
00:14:37,301 --> 00:14:41,050
you get 15 percent off and it really is 
better than beating off.

356
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,850
That's my point.
You know you beat off.

357
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,170
I do too.
You know,

358
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:47,140
you know we all do.
Just stop being shy.

359
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,690
Get one of those was excellent.
$60.

360
00:14:49,691 --> 00:14:51,320
Well invested.
You'll enjoy your,

361
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:55,400
your nuts sessions to the creators.
A flashlight.

362
00:14:55,401 --> 00:14:57,200
You guys need to think of a thing that 
where you can just.

363
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:02,680
You can close it up and then throw it 
into like your washer and it washes 

364
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,340
through on its own.
Taking notes.

365
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:06,050
Cleanup.
That sucks.

366
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:09,350
Yeah.
It's a little annoying dishwasher.

367
00:15:09,351 --> 00:15:10,790
You know what I mean?
You can't be lazy,

368
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:15,791
Bro.
You can't have a self cleaning 

369
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:17,690
fleshlight.
The last thing I want to do afterwards 

370
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:20,100
from a,
from a jerk off session is clean some 

371
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:20,100
shit up.
My Samara Dvds.

372
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,250
We didn't give him a music video this 
week either.

373
00:15:22,251 --> 00:15:25,010
We'll give you one more Sashi I love 
your cock sucker.

374
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:30,060
[inaudible] Musashi.
A film by Hiroshi in a a 10th planet.

375
00:15:30,981 --> 00:15:33,770
Kush 19 is up right now.
Just went up today.

376
00:15:33,771 --> 00:15:36,020
10 planet watching on Youtube.
Thank you.

377
00:15:36,021 --> 00:15:41,021
Everybody came to Boston this week.
We had a great fucking time at the 

378
00:15:41,021 --> 00:15:41,021
Wilbur theater.
That was awesome.

379
00:15:41,021 --> 00:15:41,480
Thank you everybody that tunes into the 
podcast.

380
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,850

fuck.

383
00:15:49,821 --> 00:15:51,440
