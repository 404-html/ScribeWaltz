00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:02,910
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:08,010
When you come across people like that
because you're in the criminal defense

3
00:00:08,011 --> 00:00:10,380
attorney world and you have
to represent these people,

4
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:11,783
do you,

5
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:14,910
do you try to think like is
there a way to fix this guy?

6
00:00:14,911 --> 00:00:15,151
I mean,

7
00:00:15,151 --> 00:00:17,760
do you put that in your head or
do you just go and try to win?

8
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:19,200
I try.

9
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:20,010
Well,

10
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:20,730
when I get,

11
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:24,790
when I would get them to do the
apologies because one of the.

12
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:27,330
I mean the thing is like
for a lot of these guys,

13
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,770
too many witnesses,

14
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:30,030
too much of a record.

15
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:32,010
It's coming down to this fucking apology,

16
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:32,520
right?

17
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,630
It's coming down to our plan for what
we're going to do next and talking with

18
00:00:36,631 --> 00:00:39,900
them and coming up with a reasonable
plan about what they're going to do after

19
00:00:39,901 --> 00:00:44,901
jail or what they could do instead of
jail and addressing like why would they

20
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:47,100
they did something wrong.

21
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:47,521
Okay.

22
00:00:47,521 --> 00:00:48,480
Why was it wrong?

23
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:53,490
Like I would go through with my clients
a lot of the times if I wasn't sure that

24
00:00:53,491 --> 00:00:54,960
they were getting it and I would be like,

25
00:00:54,961 --> 00:00:55,770
okay,

26
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:57,600
so you're going to have to
give an apology to the judge.

27
00:00:57,601 --> 00:00:59,550
You're going to have to tell
them that what you did is wrong.

28
00:00:59,551 --> 00:01:01,950
You're going to have to tell him that
you know that it was wrong and you're

29
00:01:01,951 --> 00:01:02,461
gonna have to tell them,

30
00:01:02,461 --> 00:01:03,480
you know why it was wrong.

31
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:07,350
So why is it wrong to hit your girlfriend?

32
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:10,293
Uh,

33
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:12,630
she doesn't want me to.

34
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:13,201
Well,

35
00:01:13,201 --> 00:01:13,780
okay.

36
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:14,400
All right.

37
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,233
There's one,

38
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:15,960
uh,

39
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:16,980
when you hit your girlfriend,

40
00:01:16,981 --> 00:01:18,180
what did the police have to do?

41
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:21,780
They have to show up and
they have to arrest me.

42
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,130
Were you nice to them?

43
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:24,083
No.

44
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:25,710
Do you think they like that?

45
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:26,813
No.

46
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:30,510
Do you think now it'd be the time to
apologize for being a dick to them when

47
00:01:30,511 --> 00:01:31,860
they were just doing their jobs?

48
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:33,833
Yeah.

49
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:34,470
Okay.

50
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:36,060
But now say it in a different way.

51
00:01:36,061 --> 00:01:40,310
Say it in a nice way and then I
made them say it in a nice light.

52
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:42,090
Then you have to really
coach them through this.

53
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:42,740
And do you,

54
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:43,501
do you let them know,

55
00:01:43,501 --> 00:01:46,950
like listen to your freedom may ride
on whether or not you're believable?

56
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,500
Yep.

57
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:48,220
Yep.

58
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:49,350
Most important performance.

59
00:01:49,351 --> 00:01:50,250
I would tell them like,

60
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:50,850
you,

61
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:52,500
you're not going to lie up there.

62
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,240
Everything you say is going to be true.

63
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:59,600
We just need to make you fucking
recognize you for just a couple minutes.

64
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:03,390
You got to recognize this situation
because you can't lie out there.

65
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:04,560
They hear too many lies.

66
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:05,523
They don't like lies.

67
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,950
Just it's like George Michael and freedom,

68
00:02:07,951 --> 00:02:09,750
like take a lie and make it true.

69
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,000
A lot of times I would
ask quote George Michael,

70
00:02:12,001 --> 00:02:12,181
yeah,

71
00:02:12,181 --> 00:02:13,500
I did that song freedom.

72
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:13,800
Yeah.

73
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,580
It's a good song.

74
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:15,211
It is a good song,

75
00:02:15,211 --> 00:02:15,550
right?

76
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:15,810
Yeah.

77
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:16,910
Good on you for Admin.

78
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:19,770
A lot of people that shy away from
giving George Michael that prompts he

79
00:02:19,771 --> 00:02:20,550
deserves.

80
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:24,000
But I would use like take
these lies and make them true.

81
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,890
I would use that on my clients.

82
00:02:25,891 --> 00:02:26,724
And he's saying that.

83
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,390
No,

84
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:27,871
I'm terrible.

85
00:02:27,871 --> 00:02:28,680
So you can say it.

86
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,140
No,

87
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:29,973
I can't.

88
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:39,803
There we go.

89
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:40,971
Dude.

90
00:02:40,971 --> 00:02:41,301
How about,

91
00:02:41,301 --> 00:02:44,830
I was in this a goat cart thing with
Jason Ellis and Dominick Cruz is there.

92
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:46,310
If you're competitive,

93
00:02:46,311 --> 00:02:47,450
you raised some fucking goat carts.

94
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:51,320
I see Dominic Cruz in the
corner hyping himself up dead.

95
00:02:51,321 --> 00:02:52,060
Serious gun.

96
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:53,000
They don't want you to win.

97
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:55,550
They don't want you to win this.

98
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:56,450
He's talking to himself.

99
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:57,070
Oh my God.

100
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:57,530
I'm like,

101
00:02:57,530 --> 00:02:57,730
oh,

102
00:02:57,730 --> 00:02:58,080
doesn't love.

103
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,770
It was crazy playing for keeps.

104
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:00,820
When this guy picks him,

105
00:03:00,821 --> 00:03:01,390
he goes,

106
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:02,380
the guy who works there,

107
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,600
it's like some costco
fucking warehouse thing.

108
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:05,410
They set up.

109
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:06,100
He goes,

110
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:06,970
fucking crazy.

111
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:08,423
And I went,

112
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:09,430
I guess man,

113
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:11,050
that's why he's world champ.

114
00:03:11,051 --> 00:03:15,130
I tell Dick Jokes and your work at
Costco because we think this is a game he

115
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:16,350
doesn't like.

116
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:17,240
There's no good.

117
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,800
I'm on one second.

118
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:20,531
Yeah,

119
00:03:20,531 --> 00:03:21,430
that's hilarious.

120
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:22,300
They don't want you to win

121
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:22,851
this sort of,

122
00:03:22,851 --> 00:03:23,061
you know,

123
00:03:23,061 --> 00:03:23,651
masculinity.

124
00:03:23,651 --> 00:03:25,760
So fragile managers
socialized to be violent.

125
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:27,100
They're not just socialized to be fine.

126
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:27,620
You know,

127
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:28,700
this is a hormone thing.

128
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:30,440
Men just are more aggressive.

129
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,930
And if you.

130
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:34,070
I means for instance in colleges,

131
00:03:34,071 --> 00:03:34,251
right?

132
00:03:34,251 --> 00:03:35,084
If you,

133
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:38,270
if you tell a women that the worst thing
that's ever going to happen to them is

134
00:03:38,271 --> 00:03:39,440
somebody putting a hand on their,

135
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:43,040
on their leg and you call that sexual
assault and you put that in the sexual

136
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:44,870
assault statistics and you know,

137
00:03:44,871 --> 00:03:45,441
you tell women,

138
00:03:45,441 --> 00:03:45,591
oh,

139
00:03:45,591 --> 00:03:47,810
you can wear whatever you want and
you can go out with 3:00 AM wearing a

140
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:49,850
miniskirt and no man has a right
to look at you and you know,

141
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:50,450
you know,

142
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:51,710
no victim blaming all the rest of it.

143
00:03:51,711 --> 00:03:55,970
You're telling women in fact that they
can put themselves in danger and bad

144
00:03:55,971 --> 00:03:57,380
things are going to happen to those women.

145
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:59,630
We do live in more civilized times,

146
00:03:59,631 --> 00:04:02,000
but we also have to recognize
that there is something,

147
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:06,530
there is something dark and dangerous
about men and it is what creates.

148
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:07,940
It's what it is,

149
00:04:07,941 --> 00:04:12,080
what has driven human civilization
to the heights that it has arisen to.

150
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:14,600
But it is also why men
for most of the prisons,

151
00:04:14,601 --> 00:04:14,900
right?

152
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:19,900
The sublime geniuses and
the knuckle dragging apes of
our species are both male.

153
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:21,740
Right?

154
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:22,160
And that's.

155
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,260
And you can see that in a variety,

156
00:04:24,261 --> 00:04:24,621
different things.

157
00:04:24,621 --> 00:04:25,730
People don't take like
you've very seriously,

158
00:04:25,731 --> 00:04:26,181
but you can see,

159
00:04:26,181 --> 00:04:26,511
for instance,

160
00:04:26,511 --> 00:04:27,530
in Icu distribution,

161
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,020
one of the suggestions
that might be the case,

162
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:30,890
you know,

163
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:35,120
sublime musical and artistic geniuses
up in the very top end of the Iq scale

164
00:04:35,121 --> 00:04:36,470
where women tend not to exist.

165
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:37,491
Likewise,

166
00:04:37,491 --> 00:04:37,730
you know,

167
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:38,620
down in the knuckle draggers,

168
00:04:38,621 --> 00:04:39,590
70 and 80 Iq,

169
00:04:39,591 --> 00:04:41,210
women tend not to exist down there either.

170
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:44,030
Men are more variable
than women in general.

171
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:46,880
Men are more complex I think
than women in some ways.

172
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:49,190
And this,

173
00:04:49,191 --> 00:04:49,431
you know,

174
00:04:49,431 --> 00:04:49,671
this,

175
00:04:49,671 --> 00:04:53,510
the idea that you can just sort of
buzzfeed your way out of rape and

176
00:04:53,511 --> 00:04:55,340
civilization is just insane.

177
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,630
Buzzfeed your way out,

178
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:56,990
you know,

179
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:57,670
if you,

180
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:58,120
if you just,

181
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,560
if you publish enough listicles.

182
00:04:59,561 --> 00:04:59,660
Yeah.

183
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:01,830
About how masculinity
is so fragile and white,

184
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:02,511
straight,

185
00:05:02,511 --> 00:05:03,010
white men are,

186
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:05,810
are the root of all evil that
that's somehow going to stop rape?

187
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:06,171
No,

188
00:05:06,171 --> 00:05:06,621
in fact,

189
00:05:06,621 --> 00:05:08,050
I think that's probably counterproductive.

190
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:10,580
I think that's probably going to
be going to push some men too,

191
00:05:10,581 --> 00:05:10,970
but you know,

192
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:14,360
boil over because they're sick
of being lied to enlight about.

193
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:16,940
But the good news is rape has
been going down for 30 years.

194
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:20,430
American college campuses are probably
the safest place you could possibly be as

195
00:05:20,431 --> 00:05:20,541
a,

196
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:21,920
as a young woman in America today,

197
00:05:21,921 --> 00:05:22,910
despite what the left tells you,

198
00:05:22,911 --> 00:05:23,900
the lies it tells you about.

199
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,010
Uh,

200
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:25,280
you know,

201
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,040
about all sorts of things we're in.

202
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:27,980
We're in a good place,

203
00:05:27,981 --> 00:05:30,860
but the left won't say that
or acknowledged victory
because it will put them all

204
00:05:30,861 --> 00:05:31,480
out of business.

205
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:31,601
Well,

206
00:05:31,601 --> 00:05:32,350
I was out of,

207
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:34,080
I was out of that head chocolate.

208
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:37,140
I didn't have enough chance to send
the kit in the mail and get it.

209
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:38,230
So I just went to the store.

210
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:39,370
I asked to,

211
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:40,410
can I just want prone.

212
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:45,450
I didn't want to spend the $94 for the
way because I didn't want to hold all

213
00:05:45,491 --> 00:05:46,430
that protein powder.

214
00:05:46,431 --> 00:05:48,910
So I went through the one
on Lankershim and he goes,

215
00:05:48,911 --> 00:05:50,380
do you take the preworkout shit?

216
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:51,220
Like I don't take my,

217
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,750
I take the fucking quadriceps.

218
00:05:52,751 --> 00:05:53,610
I didn't tell him that,

219
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:54,761
but I take the,

220
00:05:54,761 --> 00:05:56,320
I take like half of the shroom tech,

221
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:56,830
right?

222
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:58,010
I don't to have a fucking audit.

223
00:05:58,011 --> 00:06:00,290
They're going to take
half of those fuckers tax,

224
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:04,160
sometimes you're in the middle of class
and get gasping for air because so much

225
00:06:04,161 --> 00:06:06,410
air is coming into you
and my body can't take it.

226
00:06:06,411 --> 00:06:07,310
It's too much fucking.

227
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:09,230
And sometimes like you're like,

228
00:06:09,231 --> 00:06:09,651
fuck,

229
00:06:09,651 --> 00:06:10,490
this is too much.

230
00:06:10,491 --> 00:06:11,990
So I just went there one day the guy goes,

231
00:06:11,991 --> 00:06:12,471
take this.

232
00:06:12,471 --> 00:06:14,710
It's like a drink before the fucking,

233
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:15,260
uh,

234
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:16,550
before you work out again.

235
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:19,150
I had it in the bag and
I drove and I get them.

236
00:06:19,151 --> 00:06:19,311
I go,

237
00:06:19,311 --> 00:06:20,030
let me just try.

238
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:20,960
I tried half of it.

239
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:23,630
I did the class,

240
00:06:23,631 --> 00:06:25,790
but on the way home I had
the wildest fucking hot.

241
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:26,530
I had to go home,

242
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:30,980
take a shower and jerk off in the fucking
shower because the heart with real

243
00:06:30,981 --> 00:06:31,980
mama wasn't on.

244
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,960
Nobody was around.

245
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,850
I mean it was fucking evil.

246
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:36,830
And even after I jerked off,

247
00:06:36,831 --> 00:06:39,000
it stayed hot dog and the shower,

248
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:39,470
I was like,

249
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:40,820
Jesus fucking Christ,

250
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:44,840
I got to save this shit and drink
it with Mama's around these things.

251
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:48,350
But then I got scared
because after I jerked off,

252
00:06:48,351 --> 00:06:49,010
like an hour later,

253
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:51,620
my Hartstein that haven't popped up yet.

254
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:54,580
Then I'll put the shit enough with this,

255
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:55,910
but I don't do anything.

256
00:06:55,911 --> 00:06:56,510
Listen,

257
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:58,820
I've never been a proponent.

258
00:06:58,850 --> 00:06:59,510
Is that the word?

259
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:03,260
Yes to fucking red bull because when I
was shooting a movie once I was up all

260
00:07:03,261 --> 00:07:03,471
night.

261
00:07:03,471 --> 00:07:05,150
You don't blow man.

262
00:07:05,151 --> 00:07:07,430
I fucking drank three of those
red bulls when I fell asleep,

263
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:08,241
so I said,

264
00:07:08,241 --> 00:07:08,650
fuck it.

265
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:09,200
That's nothing.

266
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,033
That shit,

267
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:11,150
that shit don't work.

268
00:07:11,151 --> 00:07:12,350
I drank three of those red bulls.

269
00:07:12,351 --> 00:07:15,560
There was no set so those
things don't fucking work,

270
00:07:15,561 --> 00:07:18,680
so I've never been really
been any energy drink.

271
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,230
I grew up with energy drinks.

272
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,250
You'd expect me to like energy drinks.

273
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,720
I hate all that shit.

274
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:24,793
I don't believe it.

275
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:26,930
When I was a beginning comic,

276
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:29,170
I used to take no dollars
to drive all night.

277
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:32,600
That stuff's nasty.

278
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:37,160
Just when I would drink it with
mountain dew and smoke a joint.

279
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:38,263
You drive off.

280
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:43,370
Just look like that all night and then
you pull over and take a nap and I would

281
00:07:44,151 --> 00:07:46,310
take an opera at the car
because it was the winter,

282
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,200
like in those days I had to drive.

283
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:52,450
I would have to do the late show as a
feature and then drive back to boulder

284
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:53,660
overnight from Boise,

285
00:07:53,661 --> 00:07:56,930
Idaho or wherever the
fuck I was in billings,

286
00:07:56,931 --> 00:07:57,764
Montana.

287
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:02,540
So I would drive all night to get there
to pick up the baby in those days I'd

288
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:03,770
have to do whatever the fuck I had to do.

289
00:08:03,771 --> 00:08:04,521
One Night Jamie,

290
00:08:04,521 --> 00:08:07,940
I pulled the car over and it was freezing
out and left the car running and I

291
00:08:07,941 --> 00:08:11,210
fell asleep and when I woke up I
thought I lost control of the car.

292
00:08:11,211 --> 00:08:13,220
You have no idea what
happens to your heart.

293
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:14,030
Oh my God.

294
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:18,110
When you fall asleep and then wake up
and I had to have lights on and I saw the

295
00:08:18,111 --> 00:08:20,120
snow and I was like,

296
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:21,990
oh,

297
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:23,150
and you grabbed the steering wheel.

298
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:23,930
You put the brake on.

299
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:24,170
Really?

300
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,340
I'm not even fucking moving.

301
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:26,610
Oh my God.

302
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:26,990
So those.

303
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:29,750
No dozes with mountain
dew with all my boy.

304
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:30,380
There you go.
