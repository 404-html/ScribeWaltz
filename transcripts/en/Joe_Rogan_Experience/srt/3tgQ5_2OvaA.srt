00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:02,900
Hello Freak bitches,

2
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:05,710
and I thought I had lost that and I,

3
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:08,450
I was at a point in my life where,

4
00:00:08,451 --> 00:00:08,931
like I said,

5
00:00:08,931 --> 00:00:11,960
I was where I wanted to be
doing what I was wanting to do.

6
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:15,200
I thought I was doing
it right and I mean it.

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,010
I thought I was going to die
in 36 hours after getting shot.

8
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:24,490
I got off the stairs of an airplane in
Virginia beach and my wife had my son in

9
00:00:24,591 --> 00:00:26,470
a stroller and was
pregnant with my second,

10
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,313
my middle son.

11
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:32,450
It just was such a bizarre series of
events that happened so quickly and I went

12
00:00:32,451 --> 00:00:34,400
from going so fast to nowhere,

13
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:35,870
to having nothing to do,

14
00:00:35,871 --> 00:00:39,560
to not understanding why I couldn't
train my body to get back to where I was

15
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:42,530
because the only job I'd had in my adult
life other than working for my father,

16
00:00:42,531 --> 00:00:43,364
I had too much.

17
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:48,730
I had too much invested
in that occupational title
and I think one of the best

18
00:00:49,461 --> 00:00:52,820
things that I was able to
do in my military career was
to survive it and get out

19
00:00:52,821 --> 00:00:53,654
and to move on.

20
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:56,600
That's one of the hardest
things for fighters as well.

21
00:00:56,601 --> 00:00:59,330
It's a big thing with them
and may fighters boxers too.

22
00:00:59,331 --> 00:01:00,890
They just don't know what
to do when it's over.

23
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:01,820
They have.

24
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:06,820
They become these incredible winners
in this one avenue and then once that's

25
00:01:07,521 --> 00:01:07,960
done,

26
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:12,580
they rarely achieved that same kind of
success in anything else where they're

27
00:01:12,581 --> 00:01:14,170
probably not thinking about anything else.

28
00:01:14,171 --> 00:01:15,190
When in the middle of fighting,

29
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:17,960
which is very common with
people in the military too,

30
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:21,520
because the job does
require a very focused,

31
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:24,190
myopic sense of drive.

32
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:25,660
This is what you need to do,

33
00:01:25,661 --> 00:01:26,800
especially in the seal teams.

34
00:01:26,801 --> 00:01:27,880
It's the team comes first,

35
00:01:27,881 --> 00:01:28,361
team gear,

36
00:01:28,361 --> 00:01:28,961
personal gear.

37
00:01:28,961 --> 00:01:30,070
Then take care of yourself,

38
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:33,280
worried more about the person to your
left into the right and then worry about

39
00:01:33,281 --> 00:01:34,114
yourself,

40
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:34,390
you know,

41
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:37,750
consider the impacts of your actions and
your words on the people around you and

42
00:01:37,751 --> 00:01:38,381
then on yourself.

43
00:01:38,381 --> 00:01:39,214
So it's very.

44
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:43,810
It is very driven down
into a laser like focused,

45
00:01:43,811 --> 00:01:46,720
but that's also required to survive
and thrive in those environments.

46
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,220
But if left unchecked,

47
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:52,540
you'll end up at the end of your career
not prepared for the next phase of your

48
00:01:52,541 --> 00:01:54,430
life and say you do 20
years in the military,

49
00:01:54,431 --> 00:01:56,170
which is what you need to
do to get to retirement.

50
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:57,820
You joined when you're 18,

51
00:01:57,821 --> 00:01:58,181
so hey,

52
00:01:58,181 --> 00:01:58,901
you're 38.

53
00:01:58,901 --> 00:02:01,000
Well the average lifespan
of American is what?

54
00:02:01,001 --> 00:02:01,451
80,

55
00:02:01,451 --> 00:02:02,284
85.

56
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:03,670
You got a lot of time left.

57
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,073
What do you do?

58
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,730
And if you haven't thought about it,

59
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:08,380
it's,

60
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:09,640
it's it.

61
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:10,840
As see guys who struggle.

62
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:13,180
I see guys and I struggled myself,

63
00:02:13,181 --> 00:02:14,160
but I think I,

64
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:19,260
I think I went through that struggle
while I was still in and I think that

65
00:02:19,511 --> 00:02:23,680
struggle allow me to lift my chin up just
a little bit to look around and start

66
00:02:23,681 --> 00:02:24,580
thinking about the future.

67
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:26,110
You know,

68
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:27,640
there's a lot of shows
that turns out like,

69
00:02:27,641 --> 00:02:27,881
Whoa,

70
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:30,130
this is a four seasons of this
that you never heard of it.

71
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,600
Like maybe it's just me,

72
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:32,201
maybe I'm that.

73
00:02:32,201 --> 00:02:35,350
And it's totally possible because
there's always some fucking new musical

74
00:02:35,351 --> 00:02:36,190
artists and like,

75
00:02:36,191 --> 00:02:37,060
well who the fuck is that?

76
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:38,320
And I'll go to their instagram page.

77
00:02:38,321 --> 00:02:40,210
They have 14 million
followers and I'm like,

78
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:40,421
oh,

79
00:02:40,421 --> 00:02:41,254
it's me.

80
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,310
I'm that old man.

81
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:43,850
I'm that old banner.

82
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:44,890
Doesn't know Jack Shit.

83
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:49,240
Uber coming here was this
old prolly Armenian guy,

84
00:02:49,241 --> 00:02:51,310
probably sixties racist.

85
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:52,173
Triggered a,

86
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:53,560
stopped the show.

87
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:54,761
He,

88
00:02:54,761 --> 00:02:55,570
uh,

89
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:59,890
he's listening to what I assume he
thinks people want to listen and it's all

90
00:02:59,891 --> 00:03:00,070
this

91
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:00,371
shit.

92
00:03:00,371 --> 00:03:03,040
I couldn't name you a
fucking Jay z from a,

93
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,570
that kind of shit.

94
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:05,920
I don't know any of it.

95
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:07,360
And I'm about to say,

96
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:07,601
hey,

97
00:03:07,601 --> 00:03:09,520
you don't have to play this for us.

98
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:15,900
But then I saw him lip sinking to
the lyrics and tapping his fingers.

99
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:17,500
Oh,

100
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,460
on the steering wheel.

101
00:03:18,461 --> 00:03:18,761
I'm like,

102
00:03:18,761 --> 00:03:19,241
wow,

103
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:20,950
how out of the loop in my,

104
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:26,100
if fucking 60 year old for an uber and
Uber drivers know all the words to these

105
00:03:26,171 --> 00:03:27,070
fucking songs.

106
00:03:27,071 --> 00:03:28,570
But you never been a music guy.

107
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:29,380
No.

108
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:30,460
No music.

109
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:33,850
Now that's something that not possible.

110
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:35,081
I mean,

111
00:03:35,081 --> 00:03:37,770
I have songs I like can we will.

112
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:39,560
What's a great song like Doug Stanhope?

113
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:40,010
Here's your.

114
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:40,843
Oh yeah.

115
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:41,680
Sits back.

116
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,470
Most of the new songs that I've,

117
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:48,580
I've learned I've either heard playing
in a store or on a commercial and I go,

118
00:03:49,601 --> 00:03:49,811
ah,

119
00:03:49,811 --> 00:03:50,644
that's catchy.

120
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,481
Do live chat,

121
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:51,941
chat,

122
00:03:51,941 --> 00:03:52,451
chat,

123
00:03:52,451 --> 00:03:52,990
chat.

124
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:54,310
Don't you know that?

125
00:03:54,311 --> 00:03:55,144
I love you.

126
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,673
Ciao.

127
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,160
Ciao.

128
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:58,580
Ciao.

129
00:03:58,580 --> 00:03:59,370
Bye.

130
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:00,640
Jimmy luxury.

131
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:02,201
Yeah,

132
00:04:02,201 --> 00:04:04,330
it's from like 1997.

133
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:09,790
It was on the soundtrack of a
movie go and then they disappeared.

134
00:04:10,151 --> 00:04:12,310
You can't even find where the band is now,

135
00:04:12,311 --> 00:04:13,990
but it was on a corona commercial.

136
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:17,230
I love it and I use it as
intro music all the time.

137
00:04:17,231 --> 00:04:18,100
That pumps me up.

138
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:21,280
They go sing a song.

139
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:22,360
Well,

140
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,193
give me some volume.

141
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:26,801
See,

142
00:04:26,801 --> 00:04:28,180
I'm just seeing the video on

143
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:28,641
mute.

144
00:04:28,641 --> 00:04:29,570
I'm into their song.

145
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:32,840
This is great.

146
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:36,940
Headphones.

147
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:37,773
This is great.

148
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,100
No,

149
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,160
just know that I love you.

150
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:46,060
Always.

151
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:46,893
They.

152
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:54,420
I like how these gals are
dressed like they're 19 fifties.

153
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,710
Cover girls.

154
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,570
What is it about that look

155
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,071
right?

156
00:04:58,071 --> 00:05:00,320
That like cover pinup girl.

157
00:05:00,321 --> 00:05:01,100
That's what it's called.

158
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:01,880
Nineteen fifties.

159
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,290
Pinup girl type of look.

160
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:05,230
What is it about that feeling appealing?

161
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:07,700
Maybe it makes fat chicks look good.

162
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:11,000
Dare you doug.

163
00:05:11,001 --> 00:05:11,510
Stan hope.

164
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:14,000
Do you not realize it was
a different day and age?

165
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,340
You can't say that anymore.

166
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:17,840
Those days are done.

167
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:20,030
What's wrong with a fat girl looking good?

168
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:20,841
What's wrong with you?

169
00:05:20,841 --> 00:05:21,674
You wait.

170
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:24,600
It was,

171
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,341
it's a great thing.

172
00:05:25,341 --> 00:05:25,861
And it still is.

173
00:05:25,861 --> 00:05:25,980
I,

174
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:26,161
you know,

175
00:05:26,161 --> 00:05:27,300
I still write songs for people.

176
00:05:27,301 --> 00:05:30,870
I still write with people when they asked
me to do that for because it's cool to

177
00:05:30,871 --> 00:05:35,220
get into somebody else's head or
a kind of sit down with them and,

178
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:39,030
and try to help them realize some
vision of what it is they want to do.

179
00:05:39,031 --> 00:05:42,020
And that's still one of my
favorite things to do and I,

180
00:05:42,021 --> 00:05:45,230
I'm just as interested
in that as I am and,

181
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:46,380
and doing my own thing.

182
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,301
Wow.

183
00:05:47,301 --> 00:05:49,610
So when you learn how to write music,

184
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:50,600
um,

185
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,433
did you,

186
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:53,320
when you would write what you,

187
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:57,010
do you sit down with an
idea in mind with a guitar?

188
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:58,850
Do you sit down with a pen and pad?

189
00:05:58,851 --> 00:05:59,450
Like how do you,

190
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:00,770
how do you write songs?

191
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:01,670
Well,

192
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:05,150
if I'm riding by myself or with somebody
because there's a lot of different

193
00:06:05,151 --> 00:06:05,721
processes,

194
00:06:05,721 --> 00:06:06,554
it can be,

195
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:07,431
you know,

196
00:06:07,431 --> 00:06:09,020
whatever comes up that day for me.

197
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:11,060
Generally if I just going to say,

198
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:11,271
Hey,

199
00:06:11,271 --> 00:06:13,520
I'm going to sit down and go over
in that corner and write a song,

200
00:06:13,521 --> 00:06:14,360
I'd have a guitar,

201
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:18,410
I'd probably have a legal pad and a pen
much likely have sitting right here and

202
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:22,730
I'd start strumming until that felt
like something and how does that make me

203
00:06:22,731 --> 00:06:23,564
feel?

204
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:24,670
I don't know.

205
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:28,040
Keep started humming the melody maybe
and hopefully somewhere in humming.

206
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:32,880
The melody of word would pop
out that are noise I would make,

207
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:37,820
would turn into a word and from there
you can kinda grow this thing into

208
00:06:37,821 --> 00:06:39,200
whatever it is supposed to be.

209
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:42,200
Now that that's how I would do it
if I was sitting around by myself.

210
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:45,860
Now there's other times you and I could
be having a conversation and you could

211
00:06:45,861 --> 00:06:49,730
say a phrase or a line or or I could
read a sign going down the road.

212
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:50,691
If you're a songwriter,

213
00:06:50,691 --> 00:06:51,950
you're always writing songs.

214
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:55,100
It's not like a choice that you have.

215
00:06:55,101 --> 00:06:55,850
It's like a,

216
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:58,350
an affliction that you have in some way,

217
00:06:58,351 --> 00:07:03,351
so you just kind of walking around
a unconsciously things will hit you,

218
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:04,131
you know,

219
00:07:04,131 --> 00:07:04,341
and,

220
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:06,890
or moments will hit you or visual.

221
00:07:06,891 --> 00:07:09,470
We're hit you and that
will spark something.

222
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:10,900
So that's,

223
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:11,900
that's really,

224
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:13,343
um,

225
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:14,810
it can come from anywhere and that's.

226
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:15,980
And that's the truth.

227
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:17,780
Here's the problem with Western medicine,

228
00:07:17,781 --> 00:07:18,320
you know,

229
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,730
we're facing this.

230
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:21,051
I mean,

231
00:07:21,051 --> 00:07:23,150
it's like a war against chronic disease.

232
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:24,590
It's like we're being invaded by,

233
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:25,100
you know,

234
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,810
remember Independence Day with all this,

235
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:27,650
you know,

236
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:28,550
in doctors,

237
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,750
we got bb guns.

238
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:30,111
I mean,

239
00:07:30,111 --> 00:07:31,760
that's the stuff we are shooting at them.

240
00:07:31,761 --> 00:07:33,140
Doesn't work for chronic disease now.

241
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:33,651
Acute stuff,

242
00:07:33,651 --> 00:07:34,131
it's different,

243
00:07:34,131 --> 00:07:34,341
you know,

244
00:07:34,341 --> 00:07:36,680
there's some stuff that we
have this wonderful technology,

245
00:07:36,681 --> 00:07:40,460
but the road in the middle of diabetes
and obesity doctors are great for fixing

246
00:07:40,461 --> 00:07:41,460
broken jaw joint.

247
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:42,290
Broke his phone.

248
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:42,521
Yeah.

249
00:07:42,521 --> 00:07:43,540
There's no doubt about that.

250
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:45,700
Even even like arthritis
that I sell every day,

251
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:46,641
you know,

252
00:07:46,641 --> 00:07:50,270
if we were trained properly
in nutrition and exercise,

253
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:50,481
you know,

254
00:07:50,481 --> 00:07:51,530
that's what I've done my whole life.

255
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,210
I know what I'm doing exercise wise.

256
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,160
But you know,

257
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:58,250
if we were allowed to do that and
instead of training all these,

258
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,270
you know,

259
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:03,830
radiology technicians and blood draw
technicians and nursing assistance,

260
00:08:03,831 --> 00:08:08,831
if you had an army of preventive medicine
people and then we train all these

261
00:08:09,141 --> 00:08:10,670
people to go into people's homes,

262
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:11,570
you know,

263
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:15,620
I think Chris was talking about that and
just get the crap out of their diet and

264
00:08:15,621 --> 00:08:17,120
show them how to be healthier.

265
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:17,691
You know what I mean?

266
00:08:17,691 --> 00:08:18,030
You would,

267
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:18,863
you'd save,

268
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:19,581
you know,

269
00:08:19,581 --> 00:08:22,120
it's funny watching the politicians
debate about healthcare,

270
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:22,820
how to fund it,

271
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:23,061
you know,

272
00:08:23,061 --> 00:08:27,020
it's like you guys are arguing about
the titanic as it's coming up into the

273
00:08:27,021 --> 00:08:28,340
iceberg and you're done.

274
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:30,320
You're arguing about the
color of the deck chairs.

275
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:30,771
I mean,

276
00:08:30,771 --> 00:08:34,280
we're going over a cliff and
we're not fixing it by keeping,

277
00:08:34,281 --> 00:08:35,680
putting bandaids.

278
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,930
You're not gonna write you.

279
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:39,980
The technology's not
going to fix diabetes.

280
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:40,790
Nutritionist,

281
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:41,070
you know,

282
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:44,180
that you're essentially dealing with the
problem when it's already gotten to a

283
00:08:44,181 --> 00:08:45,410
point where you're in the hospital.

284
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:45,610
Yeah,

285
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:46,380
I mean there's,

286
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:46,670
you know,

287
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:47,121
like I said,

288
00:08:47,121 --> 00:08:47,601
there's a guy,

289
00:08:47,601 --> 00:08:48,400
Peter Attia,

290
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:48,900
I don't know if you know,

291
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:49,250
he is,

292
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:49,881
but he,

293
00:08:49,881 --> 00:08:51,980
he talks about when he was a surgeon,

294
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:55,680
he felt like he was at the bottom of a
building and somebody is throwing off and

295
00:08:55,681 --> 00:08:57,660
his job is to catch the eggs are gone,

296
00:08:57,810 --> 00:08:58,210
right?

297
00:08:58,210 --> 00:08:58,651
And he's like,

298
00:08:58,651 --> 00:08:58,741
well,

299
00:08:58,741 --> 00:09:00,510
why don't we just have a guy
stopped fucking thrown out?

300
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:02,340
And that's what medicine is.

301
00:09:02,341 --> 00:09:03,510
You're just catching the eggs.

302
00:09:03,511 --> 00:09:04,410
And so instead of that,

303
00:09:04,411 --> 00:09:06,000
we should be investing,

304
00:09:06,001 --> 00:09:06,230
you know,

305
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:07,320
all we talk about prevention,

306
00:09:07,321 --> 00:09:07,951
but it's bullshit.

307
00:09:07,951 --> 00:09:09,330
We don't do anything for prevention.

308
00:09:09,331 --> 00:09:11,190
It's so little and it'll little problem.

309
00:09:11,191 --> 00:09:14,610
The problem is a lot of it is it
doesn't work the way we've designed it,

310
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:15,030
you know.
