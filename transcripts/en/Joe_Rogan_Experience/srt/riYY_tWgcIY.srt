1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:01,170
Tell me,
what are you drawn?

2
00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:03,280
I just write it down like a Pisco 
chairs.

3
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:06,510
Burgo depot.
Oh,

4
00:00:06,511 --> 00:00:07,980
that's me.
How rude of me.

5
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:09,323
Ergo depot.com.
Ergo depot is the company that provided 

6
00:00:13,471 --> 00:00:15,450
us with Isa.
I fucking love these chairs.

7
00:00:15,451 --> 00:00:17,760
I'm not getting paid for this ad.
This isn't even an ad.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,250
I just tell people with if you have back
issues,

9
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,353
get a really good ergonomic chair.
It makes a fucking giant difference 

10
00:00:24,841 --> 00:00:25,674
because for me,
I'm sitting in this thing when I do 

11
00:00:27,271 --> 00:00:30,420
podcasts for three hours in a setting 
and my back doesn't bother me.

12
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:31,403
When I would use a regular office chair,
I would sit in it for an hour and I'd 

13
00:00:33,631 --> 00:00:34,464
start getting.
I started getting not adopt on the 

14
00:00:36,841 --> 00:00:37,674
podcast was over.
I'd have to grab like a ball and rubbed 

15
00:00:40,381 --> 00:00:42,480
my back out.
Now with these I think,

16
00:00:42,481 --> 00:00:43,314
and I think it's better for my back,
I think it acts when you force yourself 

17
00:00:46,111 --> 00:00:47,400
to sit in a good posture.

18
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:50,610
I think it's like an exercise for your 
back and the more you do it,

19
00:00:50,611 --> 00:00:51,444
like I'm super conscious of it now 
because I've always had super bad 

20
00:00:54,421 --> 00:00:55,254
posture.
I used to slump and then lean my head 

21
00:00:58,051 --> 00:01:02,270
forward to terrible things to do during 
our show.

22
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,780
So bad it looks terrible tale,
you know,

23
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:07,753
it doesn't do it when I would write to 
and it would bind up on the top of my 

24
00:01:10,291 --> 00:01:11,124
back.
So if I write for a few hours I'd be 

25
00:01:12,151 --> 00:01:12,984
like,
oh,

26
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:15,180
but ever since I got these things,
man,

27
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:18,950
he's really good ball.
Just one of those blow up balls.

28
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:20,580
Just sit on those.
Yeah.

29
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:21,414
Those workout balls.
You find that it carries over to like 

30
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,260
when you sit somewhere else now you have
better posture.

31
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,353
Totally.
Yeah.

32
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:29,580
This is how I said no.
I try to at least except when I'm.

33
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:32,430
For whatever reason,
I don't enjoy television like this.

34
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:38,210
You got to slouch feet up.
I got to be kicked back.

35
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:41,790
It isn't too so good.
God,

36
00:01:41,791 --> 00:01:42,624
it's so good.
There's rumors about the next three or 

37
00:01:44,611 --> 00:01:45,444
four seasons with them.
They do that because supposedly as you 

38
00:01:49,231 --> 00:01:52,590
would say,
they're supposed to do the.

39
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:56,850
The rumor was that they're going to go 
do at Miami season because now the whole

40
00:01:56,851 --> 00:02:01,500
cartel battle goes to Miami,
Griselda Blanco and stuff.

41
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:05,500
And then,
and then a season,

42
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:10,230
a four or five would be how the Mexican 
cartels took over.

43
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:12,210
Oh my God.
And like El Chapo.

44
00:02:12,211 --> 00:02:13,330
And so of course,
yeah.

45
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,780
Um,
my uncle Billy Corbin,

46
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:16,643

cowboys one and two.
If you haven't seen them to stop what 

50
00:02:23,641 --> 00:02:25,410
you're doing.
Amazing.

You Watch that documentary,

52
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:29,580

he's a Miami graduate,
but he's a nice,

54
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:34,740
nice kid.
Is this a Florida rivalry force?

55
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:39,150
He got y'all guys got course toxic shit.
A mother.

56
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:40,470
He's lucky they're,
they're good.

57
00:02:40,471 --> 00:02:42,890
This year we'll say no idea what you're 
doing.

58
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,110
And her suitor?
Yes.

59
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,880
Number two?
Yes.

60
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,320
Jamie cosby or something like that.
His name was cosby.

61
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,081
Really?
Yeah.

62
00:02:53,081 --> 00:02:56,780
Yeah.
The guy that that ends up like falling,

63
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:57,571
you know,
whatever.

64
00:02:57,571 --> 00:02:59,830
Seeing her while she's locked up in 
cocaine.

65
00:02:59,831 --> 00:03:00,220
Cowboys

66
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:02,230
to his last name's cosby.
I remember that.

67
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:03,490
Oh,
that's right.

68
00:03:03,491 --> 00:03:05,860
He was the guy that was like her 
boyfriend,

69
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:09,700
but she found out he was banging other 
checks and she got real pest and when he

70
00:03:09,701 --> 00:03:12,670
started seeing her he was like,
I just want to make money and I'm trying

71
00:03:12,671 --> 00:03:13,630
to move weight,
and she was like,

72
00:03:13,631 --> 00:03:14,830
what do you want?
And he's like,

73
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:15,693
Oh Hilo.
And she like had someone drop off like 

74
00:03:17,351 --> 00:03:19,660
five kilos.
We started off when he was like,

75
00:03:19,661 --> 00:03:22,960
oh my God.
And then the dude was really trafficking

76
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,300
a beautiful.
We'll get there.

77
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:31,440
Is Charles cosby sleeping that good?
How,

78
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:34,270
how much to bang?
Griselda?

79
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:38,650
He must listen for that guy.
That's the God damn lottery.

80
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:39,970
Yeah,
it was.

81
00:03:39,971 --> 00:03:42,160
It was.
You get hard for her.

82
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:43,023
You'll figure out a what?
This is all pre viagara too and they're 

83
00:03:45,701 --> 00:03:47,560
doing coke vacant out there.

84
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,630
Ooh,
good for her.

85
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:51,873
Zelda was so fucking crazy.
I never heard that story until there's 

86
00:03:58,871 --> 00:04:01,810
so many pictures until a cocaine 
cowboys.

87
00:04:01,811 --> 00:04:03,610
I had never heard of.
Never heard of it either.

88
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:05,710
So good.
So she got a documentary.

89
00:04:05,711 --> 00:04:08,530
She got killed just a couple years after
she got out.

90
00:04:08,531 --> 00:04:09,364
She went back to Columbia.
She went back and they had pictures of 

91
00:04:12,701 --> 00:04:13,630
her,
I don't know street.

92
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,050
That's perfect player.
She looks exactly like her.

93
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:21,550
What?
J Lo has a perfect face.

94
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:23,343
She really no wonder why she's so needy.
She's carrying around the Willy Wonka 

95
00:04:28,151 --> 00:04:30,970
golden ticket.
Like you better listen bitch.

96
00:04:30,971 --> 00:04:33,370
Look at that face.
Look at his ass.

97
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,430
It's kind of crazy.
Like to have that much power.

98
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:38,940
I was.
That girl has like a.

99
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:39,860
she's.
She's like,

100
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:46,410
yeah,
if she stares at me and my boyfriend get

101
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:47,994
along.

102
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:55,480
All right.
Yeah,

103
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,240
I mean,
come on man.

104
00:04:58,930 --> 00:04:59,763
Yeah,
and she's been doing it for a minute 

105
00:05:00,371 --> 00:05:02,050
too.
She's like 50 years old.

106
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:07,050
She's in her forties.
Got to be a dime piece.

107
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:07,973
You know,
I just remembered about Chris from that 

108
00:05:08,861 --> 00:05:11,590
documentary is that she named her son 
Michael Corleone.

109
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:16,350
Wow.
That's a really good name for.

110
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:19,210
I can't think of naming our next child.
Carl's Jr.

111
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,553
That'd be kind of a good.
I don'T know if this is true or if it's 

112
00:05:21,731 --> 00:05:22,564
just a rumor,
but the rumor was that j lo's boyfriend 

113
00:05:24,461 --> 00:05:26,320
who's as 20,
28 year old,

114
00:05:26,321 --> 00:05:27,154
handsome dancer fellow,
he wanted to go to the ufc and she told 

115
00:05:30,631 --> 00:05:33,760
him that he had to come with her to some
charity thing and uh,

116
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:34,900
in New York and he said,
no,

117
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:36,400
I'm going to the fights.
And she broke up with him.

118
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,250
Whoa.
Wow.

119
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:39,530
She tells you what to do.

120
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:42,690
You've got to go with her.
Yeah,

121
00:05:42,691 --> 00:05:45,850
of course.
You have to go with her little dance.

122
00:05:45,851 --> 00:05:46,930
That's his,
that's her little,

123
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:47,793
you know.
Yeah,

124
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:49,450
exactly.
Lapdog backed out.

125
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:50,740
Backup dancer.
You here.

126
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,600
Fuck me.
Look good.

127
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:54,370
And you come to charity event.
Yeah,

128
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:55,720
that's the deal.
Those,

129
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:59,540
those relationships get super weird in 
the sixties,

130
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:03,710
like once you get to this age,
that's one of those relationships.

131
00:06:03,711 --> 00:06:05,730
get real windows.
That woman,

132
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:08,000
you're a woman.
No longer as hot.

133
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:12,020
Your life falls apart if that's all 
you've banked on your whole life.

134
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:15,290
You don't know If someone's 20 slash 30 
years younger than you.

135
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:16,580
Well,
it's not just that,

136
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:17,480
right?
I mean,

137
00:06:17,481 --> 00:06:20,240
if your entire thing is based on what 
you look like,

138
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:21,283
if that's all you've really paid 
attention to and that's what you really 

139
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:26,030
rock is just that,
not your personality,

140
00:06:26,031 --> 00:06:26,864
not not your,
your enjoyment or your hobbies or 

141
00:06:30,561 --> 00:06:31,394
anything like that.

142
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:36,260
Not only does it taken away from you,
but you've had it your whole life,

143
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:37,183
so you accustom to people approaching 
you in communicating you with like 

144
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:41,893
extreme,
like niceness and kindness and desire 

145
00:06:44,781 --> 00:06:46,520
and men are just tripping over 
themselves to be with you.

146
00:06:46,521 --> 00:06:49,100
Like you have a magic potion that you 
put up.

147
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,940
Not only does that go away,
but you become repulsive,

148
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:54,970
right?
Yeah.

149
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,260
As it all starts gets weird,
and if you.

150
00:06:57,261 --> 00:07:00,020
if you can't buy into it,
if you want to extend your ears,

151
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:02,090
then you start hitting your face cut 
open.

152
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:05,840
You start getting weird shit done.
You start getting your lips done.

153
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:11,650
You have a mouth that goes ear to ear to
keep pulling them back into the mouth.

154
00:07:11,811 --> 00:07:16,670
Keeps crawling,
surrendering your age.

155
00:07:16,671 --> 00:07:17,504
Right?
It's far better alternative to be the 

156
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:26,800
dignified older woman who has never 
faced fucked up older woman.

157
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:30,920
Yeah,
that's what I'll be answering some.

158
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:36,880
It's just a thing that we haven't.
Even if you've been,

159
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:38,383
I guess they've probably been doing 
surgery on people's faces for like 20 

160
00:07:40,551 --> 00:07:41,750
years or 30 years.
Right?

161
00:07:41,751 --> 00:07:43,340
How long?
How long ago do you think they started?

162
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:46,670
I think probably in the between 30 and 
48.

163
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:50,030
And you're still an early adopter?
Oh yeah.

164
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:50,973
What do you see?
Like now the move is if you're going to 

165
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:54,620
do that,
it's the mild,

166
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,171
right?
It's,

167
00:07:55,171 --> 00:07:58,550
it's the type of the face lift or the 
nose job where you go,

168
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:00,080
oh,
something looks different,

169
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:01,760
but you can't tell.
That's a.

170
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:03,880
That's a primo job.
Yeah.

171
00:08:03,881 --> 00:08:05,900
When you see somebody and you're like,
jesus christ,

172
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:07,730
that's,
oh my god,

173
00:08:07,731 --> 00:08:08,421
look at this.
Oh,

174
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:10,370
that was Egypt.
3,000

175
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,580
bcc or close to two years before we get.

176
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:17,660
I don't trust botox and shit.
I now they're like,

177
00:08:17,661 --> 00:08:18,494
it's fine.
You can inject botulism in your face 

178
00:08:20,721 --> 00:08:22,610
with no repercussions.
Don't.

179
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:24,290
It's not.
It can't be.

180
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:26,090
It can't be.
It's got to be toxic.

181
00:08:26,091 --> 00:08:26,924
It's going to melt your face off.
We're gonna have a bunch of women with 

182
00:08:28,491 --> 00:08:32,210
melted faces in a few years right now 
that are mad at us because we don't know

183
00:08:32,211 --> 00:08:35,540
what we're talking about course,
but I gotta I gotta assume.

184
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:38,870
just assume that if you're paraLyzed in 
your fucking face to.

185
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:41,780
That's weird to you.
Talk to people who can't do that.

186
00:08:42,170 --> 00:08:46,010
You know,
like a little too shiny.

187
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:49,040
Something happens there.
Waxy,

188
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:51,800
shiny.
Like where's your head so shiny.

189
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:53,720
It doesn't move in.
It's shiny.

190
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,073
You know,
there's a time and a season to be the 

191
00:08:56,551 --> 00:08:58,590
hot chick.
Like I love.

192
00:08:58,591 --> 00:09:00,020
I love Pamela Anderson.
We,

193
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:00,963
we all did do.
But like I know there was a time where 

194
00:09:03,931 --> 00:09:08,340
she didn't surrender like you're the hot
chick for a minute and then you're,

195
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:10,250
you're just not.
It's gotta be no,

196
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:11,860
it's got to be tough.
Yeah.

197
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:13,413
Logically that,
that rush you get from all that 

198
00:09:15,451 --> 00:09:19,170
attention as that you don't get that 
feeling anymore.

199
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,270
That's got to be really hard to deal 
with.

200
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:22,081
You know?
Oh yeah.

201
00:09:22,081 --> 00:09:23,760
I can only imagine.
I mean,

202
00:09:23,761 --> 00:09:24,594
how could you.
I don't think there's probably very few 

203
00:09:28,381 --> 00:09:31,650
things in life that are like that where 
they just don't get back.

204
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:34,350
you know,
it's probably similar to an aging,

205
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,440
a rocker where you play out,
you know,

206
00:09:37,441 --> 00:09:38,274
you're,
you're playing stadiums and people are 

207
00:09:39,481 --> 00:09:42,360
like,
you get that out of a ration of everyone

208
00:09:42,361 --> 00:09:44,520
coming to your shows and it's like,
huh?

209
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:47,310
Like maybe you don't,
you don't move the tickets anymore.

210
00:09:47,311 --> 00:09:50,730
or you just stopped touring.
like there's gonna be an adjustment.

211
00:09:50,731 --> 00:09:53,130
It's not just stadiums to,
okay,

212
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:55,680
I just don't do that anymore because 
it's too much of a rush.

213
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:56,850
Yeah,
for sure.

214
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,570
Pick up heroin but see some aging rock 
for some reason or another,

215
00:10:00,571 --> 00:10:04,350
they still pull it off like,
like mick jagger can still pull it off,

216
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:06,810
but I think that's,
it's not just that he can,

217
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:10,800
like he,
first of all it goes out and still does.

218
00:10:10,801 --> 00:10:11,634
It puts on a great show,
but I think the reason that he does is 

219
00:10:13,951 --> 00:10:17,280
because you don't want to give up that,
that rush,

220
00:10:17,281 --> 00:10:20,520
that feeling of playing the stadiums 
probably.

221
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:23,460
And it's also probably fun,
really fun,

222
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:23,950
right?
How do,

223
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:24,783
how is it not fun to be mick jagger?
Apparently he works out like twice a 

224
00:10:30,131 --> 00:10:31,060
day.
really?

225
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:32,570
Currently.
He's a freak.

226
00:10:32,571 --> 00:10:33,404
He's super disciplined.
He does yoga and push ups and sit ups 

227
00:10:36,341 --> 00:10:38,590
and all kinds of crazy shit runs.
wow.

228
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:39,503
Yeah.
Apparently he's 70 something years old 

229
00:10:41,621 --> 00:10:45,640
as fuck as apparently he's super 
dedicated to exercise.

230
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:48,520
Does you think keith has the same 
workout regimen and 100 percent?

231
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:53,590
Yeah.
It's probably not doing heroin anymore.

232
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:56,440
Probably not.
They don't live that long.

233
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:58,853
Maybe they can get that good heroin.
So here he's doing sit ups and 

234
00:11:02,771 --> 00:11:05,320
apparently like look at all his dance 
moves.

235
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:07,660
I mean what fucking seven year olds can 
dance like that?

236
00:11:07,661 --> 00:11:08,494
There are men look at them and know 
there's also like a flexibility to his 

237
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:15,790
spine that you rarely see.
Like how old is mick jagger?

238
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:17,930
Let's guess.
Let's get,

239
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:21,760
I'm guessing 74.
Seventy three.

240
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:26,430
Sixty eight.
[inaudible] 68?

241
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:29,210
I think so,
yeah.

242
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,230
Seventy three.
Nailed it.

243
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:38,200
Nailed it.
Beautiful.

244
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:43,690
You used my guests.
How many 73 year olds move like that?

245
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:46,420
Come on man.
When you're 73,

246
00:11:46,421 --> 00:11:50,590
that shit is done and he's like,
he's like slinky now.

247
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:54,040
Like he's got like a got like a little 
thing to

248
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:58,270
James Brown was moving real crazy like 
it was from drUgs,

249
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:02,410
but he was doing shit.
Yoga,

250
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:05,380
somebody 20 Five Can't pull off half of 
this shit.

251
00:12:05,381 --> 00:12:07,150
You know what?
He was a freak.

252
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:08,013
Yeah.
He's a freak and he probably just did 

253
00:12:08,741 --> 00:12:10,120
it.
he probably tore his hips apart.

254
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:11,303
Well,
so did he was still doing those little 

255
00:12:15,341 --> 00:12:16,174
toes were moving around all the time.
Well prince will you still crazy dance 

256
00:12:21,461 --> 00:12:22,750
stuff.
We would spin around.

257
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:25,600
Do the splits.
Is this James Brown?

258
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:29,230
James brown gives you dancing.
Are you playing with this guy?

259
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,390
okay.
There's no volume.

260
00:12:31,391 --> 00:12:36,391
So we just watched them christ.
oh well he had some crazy moves too.

261
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:40,380
But this is a different style of dance 
that existed in 19 sixties.

262
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:44,070
Black America.
And he was the fucking man.

263
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:48,040
Do you ever see him in africa when he,
uh,

264
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:52,320
he played the concert and zaire before 
muhammad ali fought joel foreman.

265
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:54,580
George foreman.
Dude.

266
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,920
Dude.
Yeah,

267
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:57,843
it's him in zaire.
James brown was one of the baddest 

268
00:13:00,341 --> 00:13:01,174
motherfuckers of all time for sure.
Just a freak of freaks us out of his 

269
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:07,540
mind.
People are just basically,

270
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:10,990
you know,
all soul r and b artists are just trying

271
00:13:10,991 --> 00:13:13,960
to do a version of what he did for.
There was nobody before him like that.

272
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:16,120
Like you,
you have to put it into context.

273
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:17,163
You know,
when he would come out with those capes 

274
00:13:17,861 --> 00:13:20,770
on and shit like that.
Yeah.

275
00:13:20,771 --> 00:13:25,150
This is,
yeah.

276
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:28,240
Just say sex on here because I've seen 
one and look at the size of his ass.

277
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:31,470
I didn't know he had such an ass.
get the fuck out of here.

278
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:34,870
This is 76.
How will do you think he was back then?

279
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:38,250
He's probably 40 man.
He was a bad motherfucker.

280
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:41,170
Look at that mustache.
Look at his hair.

281
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:44,320
Everything they had at the rock and roll
hall of fame,

282
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:48,580
but they have a basically the same 
outfit he has on there,

283
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:53,910
but the bit dazzled word is just sex aNd
he used to wear something,

284
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,600
saYs stomach.
right now it says g,

285
00:13:57,601 --> 00:14:00,340
f o s what does that mean?
What does that mean?

286
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:04,900
Is that George Foreman,
foreman grill the originals?

287
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:07,080
Probably the first one like,
you know,

288
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,880
like a lot of black guys love acronyms 
like that.

289
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:19,540
I've heard like people do like that are 
like really into like positive thinking.

290
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:21,040
They do like,
uh,

291
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:22,490
like fame,
you know,

292
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:28,980
anyone mentioning everglades,
like some ridiculous one cfo has a soul.

293
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:39,220
Your soul fear is false evidence 
appearing real.

294
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,280
That's all.
It was weird.

295
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:48,100
I was on instagram that post the 
inspiration on harsh aggressive shit.

296
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:50,980
Keep pushing,
stay

297
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:55,250
from the traIn into the wrapping.
Appreciate the sentiment.

298
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:57,210
But it is corny,
you know,

299
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,120
it was a really funny bit about that.
So crystal,

300
00:14:59,121 --> 00:15:01,490
leah,
he's got a really funny bit about,

301
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:04,910
about how you know about those hashtag 
motivation people.

302
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:07,400
It's funny.
It's a good bit,

303
00:15:07,401 --> 00:15:08,540
man.
I got to see it.

304
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:09,920
I haven't seen that.
It's funny bit,

305
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:11,620
but it's,
it's,

306
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:13,003
it's a double edged sword because on one
hand I appreciate people that are 

307
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,960
exercising and taking care of 
themselves.

308
00:15:17,961 --> 00:15:19,550
I Appreciate people that are motivating 
people,

309
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:23,210
but it's fucking still cheesy.
do still silly.

310
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:28,450
I had this lady one time come to a show 
that I did in cleveland and she was in a

311
00:15:28,911 --> 00:15:31,250
wheelchair and she started to,
oh,

312
00:15:31,251 --> 00:15:33,580
she bought,
I was selling cds,

313
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:36,650
this is like seven years ago.
And she'd be like,

314
00:15:36,651 --> 00:15:38,330
let me get 10.
And I was like,

315
00:15:38,331 --> 00:15:39,164
you went 10.

316
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:40,800
I was like,
alright.

317
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:46,200
And I sold them to her and then the next
day she comes and she buys 10 more and I

318
00:15:46,851 --> 00:15:47,540
go,
all right,

319
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:49,280
I can't,
I can't let you keep buying it.

320
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:51,070
It's like,
I'll just give them to you now.

321
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:51,913
I want to support you.
And then she would start to write like 

322
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:55,213
she did that to open up the email 
exchange and then started the email me 

323
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:06,440
like ask me questions and then download 
about just everything that was bothering

324
00:16:07,371 --> 00:16:08,204
her and things that are bad in her life.
And then I'm going to have this 

325
00:16:10,371 --> 00:16:14,090
procedure done.
Ali's remember I Was like,

326
00:16:14,091 --> 00:16:14,780
I'd be like,
alright,

327
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:15,613
you know,
I communicate with her and then I go 

328
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:19,340
back and she comes again to the first 
show.

329
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:20,893
And I go,
uh,

330
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:21,471
Well,
you know,

331
00:16:21,471 --> 00:16:23,240
I just,
I'm glad that,

332
00:16:23,241 --> 00:16:24,130
um,
you,

333
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:25,280
you look like you're all right.

334
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:27,400
And um,
you know,

335
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,273
the other thing I like about you iS 
you're not into all those inspirational 

336
00:16:30,321 --> 00:16:32,750
quotes.
I just told her that and she goes,

337
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:35,600
I love inspirational quotes.
And I was like,

338
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:39,050
oh,
why don't you bring that up?

339
00:16:39,051 --> 00:16:42,830
I don't know,
I think because I hate it,

340
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,930
I hate it.
And I was just thinking about like,

341
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,900
she doesn't do like keep your head up 
stuff.

342
00:16:47,901 --> 00:16:49,610
Like she didn't do that.
I was like,

343
00:16:49,611 --> 00:16:50,270
You know,
you,

344
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:52,730
you're positive without having to remind
everybody about it.

345
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:53,781
And she's like,
no,

346
00:16:53,781 --> 00:16:55,370
I love that stuff.
And I was like,

347
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:56,540
ooh,
uh,

348
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,780
was that it?
Now she was like,

349
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:04,520
I'm getting my leg removed next week.
And then she was like,

350
00:17:04,521 --> 00:17:05,720
uh,
I have,

351
00:17:05,721 --> 00:17:07,160
uh,
one of my kidneys.

352
00:17:07,161 --> 00:17:09,920
they already took out.
My son is Afghanistan,

353
00:17:09,921 --> 00:17:10,790
he got shot.
I'm like,

354
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:11,580
oh,
I don't know.

355
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:16,580
I'll tell you like you want to see the.
I was talking to a dude this weekend who

356
00:17:17,061 --> 00:17:17,894
was a doctor.
He was telling us about a surgerY that 

357
00:17:22,941 --> 00:17:23,774
they had to perform on this woman.
She had to get her leg removed so they 

358
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:28,173
had to cut through bone and meat and 
hack this woman's leg off for some 

359
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:34,430
medical reason.
I don't know what the reason was.

360
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:37,250
So they're in the middle of doing this 
procedure.

361
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,113
They remove her leg and he turns around 
and the doctor that is with has the leg 

362
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:47,291
over his head like this,
like

363
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:54,720
some crazy caveman joe in the operating 
room.

364
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:57,930
Just remove this lady's leg over his 
head.

365
00:17:57,931 --> 00:18:02,790
He's going,
he's going to eat or something like it's

366
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:05,040
fucking.
It's hilarious,

367
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:07,830
but super disturbing.
But I guess,

368
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:09,030
I mean,
you're just over it.

369
00:18:09,031 --> 00:18:12,190
When You do it enough.
Look at him joking around about it.

370
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,890
It's not going to make her leg like.
I mean,

371
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:18,810
she's already witnessed,
witnessed surgery.

372
00:18:18,811 --> 00:18:21,420
You were going in and observe surgery.
I saw my own surgery.

373
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:23,410
Surgery might.
Yeah,

374
00:18:23,411 --> 00:18:25,810
my knee done.
My first knee operation.

375
00:18:25,811 --> 00:18:27,740
I wanted to watch it.
So they,

376
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:28,583
um,
they gave me an epidural and I've 

377
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,513
watched it.
What do you think was interesting early 

378
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:33,160
though,
right?

379
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,630
It's interesting to look at your body 
like,

380
00:18:34,631 --> 00:18:37,790
um,
um,

381
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:40,060
like,
like the joints.

382
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:43,390
They seem like when,
when you're getting operated on,

383
00:18:43,391 --> 00:18:45,850
they're fixing something.
The joint seemed like a,

384
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:48,610
like a hinge instead of like a part of 
your body,

385
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:50,560
like you see it as um,
you know,

386
00:18:50,561 --> 00:18:54,490
you see what would a joint actually is 
when you see the tissue in there because

387
00:18:54,491 --> 00:18:56,410
it's,
it was a complicated procedure.

388
00:18:56,411 --> 00:18:57,244
IT's called a patella tendon graft.
They open up your knee like a fish and 

389
00:19:00,371 --> 00:19:02,500
then they take a chunk of your patella 
tendon,

390
00:19:02,501 --> 00:19:05,410
which is your big thick.
This one that's on the front,

391
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:08,500
it's pretty thick and you don't need all
of that.

392
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,393
So they take like a third of it and then
they open you up and then they screw it 

393
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:15,820
into the bone and the top and screwed 
into the bone and the bottom.

394
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,480
And then they stitch it all up and it 
was so weird to watch them do that.

395
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:21,190
And it was so much better after that 
surgery.

396
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:24,040
What was,
it was fucked before the surgery.

397
00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:24,830
It was too,
it was

398
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,000
wobbly.
Wait a minute.

399
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:26,863
So there,
but you're watching and they're cutting 

400
00:19:28,641 --> 00:19:33,330
into you and you know,
feelings of when I was birthing our son,

401
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:35,300
she's like,
do you want a mirror to see his head?

402
00:19:35,301 --> 00:19:36,220
I was like,
no,

403
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:39,050
no,
fuck no.

404
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:42,710
So I mean that's pretty amazed that you 
were able to look at

405
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:44,430
your own body.
wanted to see it.

406
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:45,543
Yeah.
I was hoping I was never going to do 

407
00:19:47,501 --> 00:19:48,311
this again.
I'm like,

408
00:19:48,311 --> 00:19:49,150
well,
if I'm going to do this,

409
00:19:49,151 --> 00:19:50,570
I want to watch it.
I observed

410
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:55,600
the food day of surgery an entire day.
Like I saw eight operations when I was a

411
00:19:57,050 --> 00:19:57,883
freshman in high school.
I had the illusion that I would be a 

412
00:19:59,301 --> 00:20:00,134
doctor,

413
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:05,570
I want to be a doctor.
And then my uncle was

414
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:06,463
dr.
He set me up at the mayo clinic in 

415
00:20:08,701 --> 00:20:12,220
jacksonville and so I meet this guy and 
I was pretty big kid.

416
00:20:12,221 --> 00:20:13,740
So they're like,
what college do you go to?

417
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:14,830
It was like,
no,

418
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:16,080
I'm at school.
And they're like,

419
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,640
okay,
you ready to see this?

420
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:18,493
Like they thought it was a little more.
And the first one we see is a woman who 

421
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:23,533
spread eagle.
She's 80 and they were moving assist 

422
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:29,280
from her vagina and here's the thing.
He goes,

423
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:33,150
so he comes over it,
he comes over to me and I'm with my dad,

424
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:34,380
and he goes,
hey,

425
00:20:34,381 --> 00:20:37,410
don't make any like jokes while you're 
in here.

426
00:20:37,411 --> 00:20:38,760
And I go,
what are you talking about?

427
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:40,050
He goes,
she's awake.

428
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:40,830
So if you're like,
oh,

429
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:41,663
look at her old policy.

430
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:46,483
Okay

431
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:52,570
pussy though.
But the best way they go in gnarly,

432
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:57,340
they fucking open up the cyst is the 
size of a softball.

433
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:59,110
Oh my god.
So the guy's like,

434
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:01,000
this is the biggest cyst we've ever 
seen.

435
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:04,900
Has the.
Has another nurse go get a camera,

436
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:07,630
starts documentaries like this is going 
to be in a journal.

437
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:08,853
This is incredible.
Then they rupture it and it's shooting 

438
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,233
out of there.
Have you ever gone to dr pimple 

439
00:21:15,761 --> 00:21:20,550
popper.com
headphones,

440
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:26,040
headphones to the dr pepper lady on 
instagram and I'm obsessed with her page

441
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:31,280
and she's got like millions of followers
to because she.

442
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:32,733
All she does is show or youtube videos 
and our instagram videos are all just 

443
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:40,230
her popping cysts and it is strangely 
strangely.

444
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,730
So she cut Dr.
Sandra Lee.

445
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:46,593
Hello,
sandra.

446
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:47,663
Um,
millions of millions of views on 

447
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,120
instagram,
millions of views on youtube.

448
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,290
Oh no,

449
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,610
Wait,
wait till you see it.

450
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,473
You're not going to bark yet.
So right now she's cutting into this 

451
00:21:57,041 --> 00:22:01,870
woman's back who has what looks like 
click a small frog growing her back.

452
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:02,823
So she's like cutting the top of it off.
Cutting a chunk of the meeting was 

453
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:08,510
really good at cutting it yet,
right?

454
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:10,373
Yeah,
because she wants to remove it in one 

455
00:22:12,491 --> 00:22:14,200
chunk.
Like sometimes she can get them.

456
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:18,940
She's opening it up right now with these
scissors.

457
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,073
This is not the most satisfying because 
this right now we're just looking at 

458
00:22:22,451 --> 00:22:23,500
surgery.
You okay?

459
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:28,630
Christina just said she's snipping.
Oh wait,

460
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:31,890
gotta be so nasty.
Joe.

461
00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:33,123
Um,
I have seen so many people get cut and 

462
00:22:36,881 --> 00:22:41,530
knocked unconscious and beat up.
I'm not averse to looking at a ces.

463
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:44,160
Now look how nasty this is.
Once you start scoring.

464
00:22:44,161 --> 00:22:45,910
And here we go.
Here we go.

465
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:47,043
Come on,
come on.

466
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,280
Oh.
Oh god.

467
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:56,540
What?
That's rough enemy person's body vomit.

468
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,190
That's a back.
Is that a back?

469
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:04,090
What is that?
Started to tell what is the,

470
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:06,280
what is assist.
It's just nasty.

471
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:08,500
I dunno.
Just nasty shit.

472
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:11,560
I dunno what assistance that was.
Huh?

473
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:12,783
I think it's dead skin.
I read about one of these recently 

474
00:23:13,871 --> 00:23:15,850
because they're always watching,
but why don't you just google it?

475
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:16,451
I did.
Oh,

476
00:23:16,451 --> 00:23:18,130
I can't.
Oh,

477
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:21,370
well we'll find out.
We did so much speculation.

478
00:23:21,371 --> 00:23:24,400
We did a podcast this weekend without,
without jamie on the,

479
00:23:24,401 --> 00:23:25,234
uh,
the computer and we were asking 

480
00:23:26,291 --> 00:23:29,710
questions and no one ever answered the 
questions we just said it was like a 100

481
00:23:29,711 --> 00:23:31,690
percent misinformation.
I heard.

482
00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:33,790
I heard it was like this.
Do you want to look?

483
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,140
I'm hey jamie.
I think we're all good.

484
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:36,580
That was great.
Thanks.

485
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:41,370
I just going to get to the end of it.
Some of them are fucking unbelievable.

486
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:44,380
Push them now.
That's like trash.

487
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:48,140
Trash in your body.
Five minutes left on this video.

488
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:51,690
I'm going to throw up.
I just do it to me.

489
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:54,530
You just had a baby.
Should be like durable now.

490
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:57,440
But this,
it's like the whole.

491
00:23:57,610 --> 00:24:00,620
Yeah,
it's crazy how big that hole is.

492
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:04,220
Like that's a goddamn gaping holes.
That's fine.

493
00:24:04,221 --> 00:24:06,850
I don't like the stuff coming out.
That's the gnarly parts.

494
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:09,710
Wonder why she had to do it.
That obviously I'm not a doctor,

495
00:24:09,711 --> 00:24:10,544
I'm not criticizing or technique,
but I wonder why you have to take a 

496
00:24:13,821 --> 00:24:17,570
chunk out of the skin and less instead 
of like making like a little hatch.

497
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:22,220
Like you remember those old schools?
Pajamas scape.

498
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:25,820
Dude,
that's a small fish.

499
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:29,540
Oh,
for the love of mommy.

500
00:24:29,541 --> 00:24:30,374
You got to get that last part out.
That sack that it's all holding in and 

501
00:24:32,601 --> 00:24:33,434
then what's left over after I heard that
they don't actually know what causes 

502
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:38,480
cysts.
Oh,

503
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,690
how comforting.
Yeah.

504
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:42,070
They don't know anything.
You just growing up.

505
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:45,160
Golf ball sized bag of pus on,
you know,

506
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:47,600
we don't know if people grow in weird 
spots too.

507
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:48,860
They don't even know why.
Yeah,

508
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:51,590
go weird spots are going to top your 
head and shit.

509
00:24:52,410 --> 00:24:56,360
Like they over grow and they're not 
cancer.

510
00:24:56,410 --> 00:25:00,010
It's a member.
Ooh.

511
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:02,670
Membrane the membrane.
This membrane,

512
00:25:02,671 --> 00:25:03,504
the membrane in the body.
A membranous sack or cab cavity of 

513
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:12,170
abnormal character containing fluid at 
tough protective capsule.

514
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:15,420
And closing the larva of parasitic worm.
No.

515
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:16,693
So yeah,
I guess it's a cavity containing fluid 

516
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:21,830
and they use the word fluid super 
loosely.

517
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:31,160
Fluid pus.
It's fluid.

518
00:25:32,601 --> 00:25:35,660
It's like a whipped cream,
like pissy nastiness.

519
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:41,090
That's not good.
Nah,

520
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,530
no,
on vagina too.

521
00:25:42,531 --> 00:25:44,440
That's.
I imagine this ladies,

522
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:45,573
I still remember it.
It was her badge on the outer part so 

523
00:25:48,621 --> 00:25:51,260
everybody could see or inside it was 
inside.

524
00:25:51,261 --> 00:25:52,094
But then they,
they,

525
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,193
they had her in some way where they 
could push back and you could see it 

526
00:25:56,241 --> 00:25:57,420
coming out of the side,
you know,

527
00:25:57,421 --> 00:26:02,421
coming like on the wall in a speculum.
Like they opened her up.

528
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:07,960
Wow.
I wonder if it really had fluid though.

529
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:09,680
I do remember that.
It wasn't like this.

530
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:12,470
It really was like a stream coming.
I hate.

531
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:13,573
I hate to be disrespectful,
but do you think it made her pussy 

532
00:26:14,721 --> 00:26:16,070
tighter?
I think so.

533
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:16,983
It seems like a really good question.
I don't see how you had it in your 

534
00:26:22,881 --> 00:26:23,630
mouth.
Would be sure.

535
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:24,500
Tough to swallow.

536
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:29,190
So imagine if you got it in your box.
I think that's how they fit.

537
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:30,043
Snug it up there.
Discovered it because her husband was 

538
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:33,170
for tight.
He's like,

539
00:26:33,171 --> 00:26:38,171
oh shit,
maybe 85 guys.

540
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:43,063
Do you guys remember James Brown went on
a shooting spree because someone uses 

541
00:26:45,781 --> 00:26:46,614
toiLet.
Someone took a shit and it's personal 

542
00:26:47,881 --> 00:26:49,620
bathroom.
You don't remember this.

543
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:51,870
He got in a shootout with the cops.
He uh,

544
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:52,733
he drove off with a shotgun.
He threatened someone with a gun in the 

545
00:26:55,801 --> 00:26:58,180
office for shitting in his toilet.
And then he,

546
00:26:58,230 --> 00:27:01,470
he got in a car,
a high speed chase the cops,

547
00:27:01,471 --> 00:27:05,790
the cops shot his tire out,
kept driving really fast.

548
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,530
That's what it is.
Last mug shot.

549
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,940
How many times you've been arrested?
He got arrested a few times.

550
00:27:11,941 --> 00:27:14,130
His last one,
he and mike.

551
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:18,773
Mike epps has the job.
Remember that the year after year that 

552
00:27:23,491 --> 00:27:25,810
that happened,
mike epps put out a special.

553
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:27,920
He's like,
band looked like a thunder cat.

554
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:31,350
That's the Best description of that 
because he did.

555
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:32,573
He had like this straight and he had 
that ridiculous smile in that I 

556
00:27:36,271 --> 00:27:37,104
remember.
Do you remember the James Brown super 

557
00:27:38,791 --> 00:27:39,930
coked out interview?
He did.

558
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:42,720
So I was just thinking about that one.
What was that interview on?

559
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:43,990
It was on cnn.
This,

560
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:48,330
this looks like it get to shoot that 
police on pcp.

561
00:27:48,331 --> 00:27:50,970
It says,
oh yes,

562
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,920
I do remember this.
CrazY glass.

563
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:54,900
Give us some volume,
jamie.

564
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:59,310
his job is going crazy.
I miss pcp.

565
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:02,700
Yeah.
It was just saying living in America,

566
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:05,440
nothing wrong.
Nothing wrong at all.

567
00:28:05,441 --> 00:28:07,960
You're not in any difficulty,
but you're out on bond.

568
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:10,600
No,
not all.

569
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:13,230
The charges been dropped.
A lot oF love.

570
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:19,710
You out on lumber out of love,
which is it I don't love.

571
00:28:20,530 --> 00:28:21,363
From tonight.
You'll find me now at the time you and 

572

two of you going to be able to work this

573
00:28:28,721 --> 00:28:33,430

happened.

574
00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:35,980

When are you leaving tomorrow and where

576
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:41,680

00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,400
Oh my god.

582
00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:08,930
We've heArd that in two days.
That's great.

583
00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:12,430
Stay right there.
I'll have to talk about.

584
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:14,550
Well,

585
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:17,650
listened.
That's crazy.

586
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,330
What are you going to be doing on this 
tour?

587
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:21,670
I'm going to be doing.
Papa got a brand new bag,

588
00:29:21,671 --> 00:29:26,350
a little bit of sex,
but she didn't get above that feel good.

589
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:30,323
Wouldn't have radio shows.
Would call someone up and then we got 

590
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:36,300
more.
Oh yeah.

591
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:39,590
Cause he tells her that he smells good 
and he makes love.

592
00:29:39,591 --> 00:29:40,910
Good go.
No,

593
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:45,280
you want to mingle now,
but when you get out there,

594
00:29:45,281 --> 00:29:47,120
why do you think that is?
What is that?

595
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:50,770
The women loved you when you get out 
there was that lady.

596
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:52,900
Well,
I'm asking You.

597
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:59,340
You feel good and you sing good and meg

598
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:03,940
Good.
Well now we are.

599
00:30:03,941 --> 00:30:06,200
We don't have to ask anybody else.
We got back from

600
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:09,673
now you're involved in the magazine.
Tell us a little bit about possible 

601
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:14,183
magazine.

602
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:16,333
That's a crazy.
Rogers angelo was a pianist and james 

603
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:26,520
advised,
and we're doing a fantastic job.

604
00:30:26,521 --> 00:30:29,980
The second coming on this week.
I said,

605
00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:34,650
we have the pope and I believe william.
He's losing.

606
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:39,040
Yeah,
he looks like Michael Jackson.

607
00:30:39,041 --> 00:30:43,960
We turn into a werewolf and thriller his
eyes nailed it.

608
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:47,200
Look at those glasses it looks like.
Yeah,

609
00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:49,490
yeah,
yeah,

610
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:50,240
yep.

611
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,073
Did you ever see The short movie like 
that short film I made a few years ago 

612
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:56,960
about him?
No.

613
00:30:56,990 --> 00:31:00,770
You made a film about James Brown made a
film with ryan sickler,

614
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:05,830
a comedian about a real story about him 
that it's called nine inches and it's on

615
00:31:08,121 --> 00:31:08,954
my youtube page.
And what it's about is that there's a 

616
00:31:10,521 --> 00:31:11,354
real story about two guys who shot each 
other in an argument over james brown's 

617
00:31:16,821 --> 00:31:18,480
height.
What?

618
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:21,650
Yeah.
So we made a short about it.

619
00:31:21,890 --> 00:31:23,690
This is all about James Brown.
No,

620
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:28,820
how did I not know about this?
But it happened in Alabama and.

621
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:29,863
Oh,
here it is.

622
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:30,430
Yeah.
Yeah.

623
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:31,520
He just pulled it up.
But,

624
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:32,593
but based on a real story,
two guys got in an argument about how 

625
00:31:36,531 --> 00:31:40,430
tall he is and basically one guy was 
like,

626
00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:42,070
you know,
james brown's five,

627
00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:43,680
five or whatever,
and that dude,

628
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:45,440
he's six feet motherfucker.
And they got,

629
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:47,570
he got,
they got so heated,

630
00:31:47,571 --> 00:31:52,200
they shot each other over his height.
So that's why it's called fiverr.

631
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:57,380
It's because of the discrepancy in area,
but it's a real story that,

632
00:31:57,930 --> 00:32:00,900
that these guys were friends,
like good friends.

633
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:04,140
People get mad about nothing.
Oh yeah.

634
00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:06,810
People get mad about shit that doesn't 
make any sense.

635
00:32:06,811 --> 00:32:08,790
Wind up killing each other because 
nobody wants it back down.

636
00:32:08,791 --> 00:32:10,520
Then escalates.
You got to be right.

637
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:11,423
Yeah.
Yeah.

638
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:14,100
I'm more concerned about pcp.
Where did it go?

639
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:15,383
Because remember there was a lot of cool
stuff in the eighties that happened 

640
00:32:17,131 --> 00:32:17,964
because of angel dust.
People lifted cars and we're where it's 

641
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:25,983
pcp.
My old boxing coach had his finger 

642
00:32:27,421 --> 00:32:28,254
bitten off any of our pieces of really 
getting off on pcp and he had it 

643
00:32:34,351 --> 00:32:36,640
replaced with his toe.
He had his,

644
00:32:36,970 --> 00:32:40,070
his not as big toe,
but as two biggest

645
00:32:40,090 --> 00:32:43,770
toe put in right here.
And you being us.

646
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,920
No 100 percent serious.
Joe lake.

647
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:48,260
I love that guy to death.
He's my boxing coach.

648
00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:53,330
When I was kid,
he had his finger permanently bent so he

649
00:32:53,331 --> 00:32:54,164
could throw a right hook.
He's a southpaw and a very good right 

650
00:32:56,031 --> 00:32:57,140
hook.
He didn't want to give it up.

651
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:58,060
So,
uh,

652
00:32:58,060 --> 00:33:00,440
when you would shake his hand,
shake it like that.

653
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:03,680
He has like a little,
little baby finger.

654
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,240
Yeah,
constantly.

655
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:07,800
That was the toe that was a toe.
It's toe,

656
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:10,980
but now it's his index finger.
And he had his toe.

657
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:13,390
yeah.
Yeah,

658
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,290
his foot,
his foot only.

659
00:33:15,291 --> 00:33:18,080
It was four toes as a toe,
big toe.

660
00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:23,270
And then three handlers and somebody hit
it off and say,

661
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:26,310
oh,
that reminds me,

662
00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:28,483
that reminds me so much fun that I was 
with diaz for three days and I'll tell 

663
00:33:35,151 --> 00:33:38,210
you why because this is so perfect.

664
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:38,571
So,
um,

665
00:33:38,571 --> 00:33:39,404
with the,
as we're leaving the shoreline 

666
00:33:40,491 --> 00:33:42,260
amphitheater,
we did the odd ball tour.

667
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:44,230
So we're leaving this shoreline 
amphitheater.

668
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:45,890
He just,
he massacred,

669
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:47,870
he,
it was like close to 10,000

670
00:33:47,871 --> 00:33:52,100
people we get in the shuttle because 
there's intermission and joey and I were

671
00:33:52,101 --> 00:33:55,340
before intermission.
So we tell the driver we want to go back

672
00:33:55,341 --> 00:33:56,174
to the hotel.
There's still another half of show to 

673
00:33:57,861 --> 00:33:59,930
go.
So it was just joey,

674
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,820
myself,
and the driver.

675
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:04,460
And we get in the car,
there's no music on.

676
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:07,310
We're just talking and we just hit one 
of those moments.

677
00:34:07,311 --> 00:34:08,144
You know when you're on a highway at 
night and you kind of hit that thing 

678
00:34:10,851 --> 00:34:11,684
where it's like you just,
everyone stopped talking for a minute 

679
00:34:13,610 --> 00:34:14,443
and you're looking out the window and 
you can feel like I'm just kind of 

680
00:34:17,571 --> 00:34:18,404
staring off.
No one's talkinG and then after like 15 

681
00:34:21,801 --> 00:34:23,270
seconds of silence,
julia goes,

682
00:34:24,650 --> 00:34:25,120
that would tell you.

683
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:29,720
By the time I saw a guy cut open at the 
tenderloin in 1979,

684
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:32,930
stomach split wide open and I was like,
what?

685
00:34:32,931 --> 00:34:35,300
And I just see the driver's eyes 
widened.

686
00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:36,350
And I was like,
no.

687
00:34:36,351 --> 00:34:36,801
He goes,
yeah,

688
00:34:36,801 --> 00:34:39,440
iT's blood was brown because he was 
bleeding for so long.

689
00:34:39,470 --> 00:34:43,670
People just stepped over him and I saw 
two guys stab each other.

690
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:48,290
Fucking street,
1980 just over.

691
00:34:48,291 --> 00:34:49,540
Nothing.
They just stab each other.

692
00:34:49,541 --> 00:34:50,374
I didn't almost shit my pants,
but then I got used to it and then you 

693
00:34:53,241 --> 00:34:58,241
just see the was just crazy.
I got used to it.

694
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:01,700
Just look over like who's this guy 
sitting next to?

695
00:35:01,730 --> 00:35:05,210
Which is all you saw from like,
uh,

696
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:06,740
he was,
he's such a,

697
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:07,633
like a rocket ship of a personality that
you get used to like all the people on 

698
00:35:11,601 --> 00:35:13,990
this tour because I did all the dates 
and then you can,

699
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:16,520
you should see like the first night he 
came out I'd see the,

700
00:35:16,610 --> 00:35:18,610
like the oddball staff,
like turning,

701
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:23,090
like what the fuck is going on because 
his,

702
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:25,100
he's just so out of left field,
you know,

703
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,230
you can't prepare for it.
And he's just like,

704
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:28,543
he's got not a fucking his tank zero.
There's nothing just calls people cock 

705
00:35:33,471 --> 00:35:37,270
suckers.
Like the audience was up cock suckers.

706
00:35:37,271 --> 00:35:38,080
They're like,
who the

707
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:40,480
f you did it to 8,000
people last night.

708
00:35:40,490 --> 00:35:42,280
It's so great up you fucking cock 
sucker.

709
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,240
It's endearing to see him live.
Yeah.

710
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:49,500
He,
he has like some reference to it.

711
00:35:49,501 --> 00:35:50,334
Like he kNew he,
he,

712
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,990
he,
he would throw people off.

713
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:52,980
Right.
You can tell that.

714
00:35:52,981 --> 00:35:53,730
Some people knew.
They'd be like,

715
00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:55,290
oh my god.
And then he goes,

716
00:35:55,291 --> 00:35:56,640
yeah,
I say some fucked up shit.

717
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:00,060
And then,
and then he goes,

718
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:01,320
but I'm your uncle joey.
You know,

719
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,910
everyone's got an uncle joe,
he liked me.

720
00:36:03,130 --> 00:36:03,963
It's a little uncomfortable at first,
like a finger in your ass and then they 

721
00:36:05,591 --> 00:36:10,591
just like laughing again right away.
He gets how he hits people,

722
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:11,791
you know?
Yeah.

723
00:36:11,791 --> 00:36:13,440
He something odd.
There's no,

724
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:16,860
I've never been anYbody like him for so 
force of nature.

725
00:36:17,330 --> 00:36:22,320
It's like a rare occurrence really owns 
his farts in public,

726
00:36:22,730 --> 00:36:23,563
but he was just like,
you got to tell you something else in a 

727
00:36:28,530 --> 00:36:29,040
bar.

728
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:33,990
And I was like so loud and it smelled so
sour and he goes,

729
00:36:33,991 --> 00:36:35,320
wait till it hits that motherfucker.
Right.

730
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:38,240
Points that the guy.
Yeah.

731
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:39,810
I mean it's crazy,
man.

732
00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:41,490
Crazy.
He's married.

733
00:36:42,430 --> 00:36:47,430
He's fired once on a point that was so 
bad that I headphones on and I smelled.

734
00:36:47,641 --> 00:36:50,460
I was in the middle of writing and I 
smelled it and I just go,

735
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:56,960
I start to make this face and then I go 
and I put my shirt on my nose.

736
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:57,873
Terrible.
and then it hits the woman behind us 

737
00:36:59,490 --> 00:37:01,080
with the headphones on,
listening to music.

738
00:37:01,081 --> 00:37:02,870
I hear,
oh my god,

739
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:14,510
oh my god.

740
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:22,070
He's got his hands rested on his gut.
He's a credit for it,

741
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:24,933
definitely do it on planes,
but I keep it private credit and no one 

742
00:37:29,911 --> 00:37:32,820
assumes I would.
So I liked to plus the sound.

743
00:37:32,821 --> 00:37:35,640
It's so much on the plane that you can 
fart and you can just let it rip.

744
00:37:35,641 --> 00:37:37,260
No one's gonna hear it.
Yes.

745
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:38,463
Good quality.
He also says things that don't add up 

746
00:37:41,491 --> 00:37:42,440
for that.
Like he like,

747
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:42,961
he,
I'm like,

748
00:37:42,961 --> 00:37:43,501
come on.
He goes,

749
00:37:43,501 --> 00:37:44,334
you don't meet dog.
It's like my favorite thing about his 

750
00:37:49,210 --> 00:37:51,320
periscopes,
periscopes.

751
00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:52,660
He'll smoke,
you know,

752
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:54,780
crazy amounts of weed.
He was like,

753
00:37:54,781 --> 00:37:55,920
at 6:00
in the morning,

754
00:37:56,030 --> 00:37:58,140
I've really like rolled two joints.
Smoked him.

755
00:37:58,260 --> 00:37:59,400
Fuck.
Are you doing with your life?

756
00:37:59,401 --> 00:38:00,840
And I'm like,
go,

757
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:03,120
you're implying that that's the 
accomplished,

758
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:06,420
like I'm doing something.
what are you doing?

759
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:10,200
He's always said I got high when I have 
to do shit early in the morning.

760
00:38:10,201 --> 00:38:11,580
I always call him because he's always 
awake.

761
00:38:11,610 --> 00:38:12,690
He's always awake.
Yeah,

762
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:15,000
he's a,
he's a maniac.

763
00:38:15,090 --> 00:38:18,000
He told me that 4:30.
So like sometimes he's like,

764
00:38:18,290 --> 00:38:19,680
you know,
it just hits me like a thought.

765
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:20,820
I just get up.
I'm like,

766
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,360
funnY,
4:30

767
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:24,310
just wants to get up.
Yeah,

768
00:38:26,490 --> 00:38:27,330
not really.
It's,

769
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,111
it's crazy,
right?

770
00:38:28,111 --> 00:38:29,880
You think that he would just be passed 
out,

771
00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:30,940
but no,
keep up.

772
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,010
Hold on.
I need to sleep.

773
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:34,740
If I get up to pee and it's like 4:00
in the morning.

774
00:38:34,870 --> 00:38:36,310
The problem is sometimes

775
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:40,600
I'll have an idea if I have an idea,
I've gone back to sleep.

776
00:38:40,601 --> 00:38:40,981
I'm like,
oh,

777
00:38:40,981 --> 00:38:43,240
I'll remember it and I never remember 
it.

778
00:38:43,241 --> 00:38:44,074
Yeah,
so now if I have any kind of an idea or 

779
00:38:45,671 --> 00:38:46,504
a think like it might be an idea,
I have to sit down and then I have to 

780
00:38:49,691 --> 00:38:52,300
write something out or talking to my 
phone.

781
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:54,460
I'm talking to my phone a little bit 
just to try to capture it.

782
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:56,380
Gotta write it down.
that's key.

783
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,393
If I don't,
I'm fucked because if I don't I'm not 

784
00:38:58,181 --> 00:39:00,390
getting any sleep because then I'll be 
sitting there thinking like,

785
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,540
gosh,
I just got up.

786
00:39:02,530 --> 00:39:03,363
It's always that thing where you go.
It could be like when you were about to 

787
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:09,490
fall asleep or about to wake up and you 
go,

788
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:11,020
oh,
I got that though.

789
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,420
That'll that'll come to me,
you know,

790
00:39:12,421 --> 00:39:15,280
when I find like I had to do this thing 
for espn today,

791
00:39:15,281 --> 00:39:16,114
so I had to get up early and I'd drive 
on the highway and traffic and all that 

792
00:39:17,741 --> 00:39:18,100
shit.

793
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:19,820
But when I was,
I got up early,

794
00:39:19,821 --> 00:39:20,654
you know,
woke up,

795
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:21,693
had a cup of coffee,
I'm out the door in the hustle and 

796
00:39:24,131 --> 00:39:26,500
bustle and there's something about like 
getting up early,

797
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:29,980
forcing yourself to get up and then 
having a cup of coffee and going out and

798
00:39:29,981 --> 00:39:31,000
do something.
It gives you,

799
00:39:31,001 --> 00:39:32,890
like,
you got to look a little momentum going.

800
00:39:33,430 --> 00:39:33,881
You knoW,
I'm like,

801
00:39:33,881 --> 00:39:35,350
I'm up early.
I'm like,

802
00:39:35,351 --> 00:39:36,184
there's something to get up early to 
really resent people that would brag 

803
00:39:40,001 --> 00:39:40,661
about it.
Like,

804
00:39:40,661 --> 00:39:45,220
well I've been up since 5:30.
Well fuck why'd good for you?

805
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:48,310
It's a little can dredge or tori.
Thank you.

806
00:39:48,490 --> 00:39:49,870
I agree.
I agree.

807
00:39:49,871 --> 00:39:51,040
Like look at,
look how,

808
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:55,010
how disciplined I am,
but now we're going to bed late or early

809
00:39:55,050 --> 00:39:55,883
were up earlier,
but now the kids up at the crack of 

810
00:39:57,641 --> 00:39:58,474
dawn,
so we got to be up to and now I'm used 

811
00:39:59,561 --> 00:39:59,770
to it.

812
00:39:59,770 --> 00:40:02,840
Now I'm one of those people,
you're just sending emails at 6:00

813
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:06,790
AM and I actually do like it more.
It doesn't make any sense,

814
00:40:06,791 --> 00:40:10,000
but I feel like when I forced myself to 
wake up in the morning,

815
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:15,300
I get a better feeling about the day.
Starting off in a good way.

816
00:40:15,941 --> 00:40:16,421
Like,
all right,

817
00:40:16,421 --> 00:40:21,421
we're up to scale.
I can't just young 11.

818
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:24,130
Just jerk off.
Yeah.

819
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:27,850
Wake up at 1230.
Hit the gym by three.

820
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:30,040
That'd be fine.
One thing I don't know.

821
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:31,980
I don't like morning workouts.
No.

822
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:34,990
I like afternoon workouts.
Workout.

823
00:40:34,991 --> 00:40:36,410
First thing you do?
Yup.

824
00:40:36,790 --> 00:40:37,623
Yeah.
I'd like to do something with no food 

825
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:43,090
on,
to do one workout in the morning,

826
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:45,250
like something,
chin ups,

827
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:46,810
body weight squats,
something like that.

828
00:40:47,930 --> 00:40:50,320
Sometimes I hit the bag,
no food.

829
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,033
I like to do that several times a week,
but I always feel stronger and I have 

830
00:40:56,141 --> 00:40:58,540
more energy if I workout late in the 
afternoon.

831
00:40:58,990 --> 00:40:59,823
Late afternoon.
Yeah.

832
00:40:59,910 --> 00:41:02,800
Yeah.
Do you overeat though after you work out

833
00:41:02,801 --> 00:41:05,830
on an empty stomach afterwards?
No.

834
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:06,990
No,
no.

835
00:41:07,730 --> 00:41:08,580
Um,
no.

836
00:41:08,590 --> 00:41:10,090
I mean I'm gonna be hungry,
but I'm always.

837
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:11,620
You have to work out.
That's not,

838
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,920
I don't eat much more.
I see what you eat on instagram.

839
00:41:15,910 --> 00:41:18,850
I put my food on instagram.
One of those annoying folks.

840
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:20,320
I have a lot of meat.
You guys want to meet.

841
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:24,790
I'll give you some elk.
Show you how to cook it.

842
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,560
Yeah.
Super good for you.

843
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:27,810
Yeah.
Do you want me?

844
00:41:28,270 --> 00:41:31,030
because you do a lot of veggies and 
meat.

845
00:41:31,031 --> 00:41:33,620
I noticed no carbs.
I very little carbs.

846
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:37,080
I eat a lot of avocados,
a lot of coconut oil.

847
00:41:37,650 --> 00:41:39,510
That's what I'm.
That's what he's doing right now.

848
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:41,150
you're not fat.
low carb.

849
00:41:41,151 --> 00:41:42,980
Yeah.
You know when you to get ahold of dude,

850
00:41:43,010 --> 00:41:45,240
you got to get a hold of some ketones.

851
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:46,340
We have them here.
Hold on.

852
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:49,290
Oh shit.
Yeah.

853
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:51,890
Somebody if you're on a key to genic 
diet.

854
00:41:52,030 --> 00:41:52,863
Yeah.
Try a few of these and tell me what you 

855
00:41:53,601 --> 00:41:54,890
think.
What is this?

856
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:57,800
It's called key genics.
This is the stuff that I use,

857
00:41:57,801 --> 00:42:00,920
but this is made by this guy dom 
d'agostino,

858
00:42:00,950 --> 00:42:01,783
who's a.
He's a research scientist from a 

859
00:42:05,781 --> 00:42:07,130
university in Florida,
by the way.

860
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:07,993
He's in Florida and he's one of the 
foremost specialists on a ketogenic 

861
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,233
diets.
The benefits of key to genic died and 

862
00:42:16,281 --> 00:42:17,114
reading a lot about it.
He's super scientific on the best 

863
00:42:19,311 --> 00:42:20,510
resource,
if you want to listen to.

864
00:42:20,511 --> 00:42:23,170
This is the tim ferriss show,
tim ferriss,

865
00:42:23,171 --> 00:42:26,750
his podcast.
He had three different podcasts with dom

866
00:42:26,751 --> 00:42:27,584
d'agostino and the first one was one of 
the things that got me super excited 

867
00:42:30,831 --> 00:42:34,430
about trying to work on a fat based 
diet.

868
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:37,190
Yeah,
just listen to all the benefits this guy

869
00:42:37,191 --> 00:42:38,024
was talking about like all the,
like there's a whole series of benefits 

870
00:42:41,301 --> 00:42:43,490
that and intermittent intermittent 
fasting,

871
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:46,460
like getting your body into a state 
where it's burning fat.

872
00:42:47,070 --> 00:42:47,960
The big one.
Now,

873
00:42:47,961 --> 00:42:49,670
the real big one though is the hunger 
thing.

874
00:42:50,090 --> 00:42:50,923
There's two big ones,
like one I know I have energy all 

875
00:42:52,401 --> 00:42:53,234
throughout the day.
I know people right now listening to 

876
00:42:54,081 --> 00:42:54,801
this going,
oh my god,

877
00:42:54,801 --> 00:42:56,360
he's talking about a ketogenic diet.
Again,

878
00:42:56,690 --> 00:42:58,970
jesus fucking christ,
because I talk about it too much really?

879
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,150
But just for just for you guys,
um,

880
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:03,920
you,
you don't have as much hunger,

881
00:43:04,130 --> 00:43:05,930
like in between meals.
You don't have that.

882
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:08,830
I'm a month into it and really?
Yeah.

883
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:13,030
I'm down almost 18 pounds.
That's incredible.

884
00:43:13,330 --> 00:43:16,180
I uh,
I basically have,

885
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:20,630
have felt that way where I'm not just 
like feeling that satisfaction more.

886
00:43:20,631 --> 00:43:23,960
I'm also eating overall less food,
you know what I mean?

887
00:43:23,961 --> 00:43:28,280
Like I used to eat just a more of a 
higher volume of food,

888
00:43:28,730 --> 00:43:29,563
you know,
like every meal was much bigger than it 

889
00:43:30,951 --> 00:43:32,990
was because that fat satisfies you.

890
00:43:33,230 --> 00:43:34,460
Yeah.
Much quicker.

891
00:43:34,490 --> 00:43:35,323
You know,
we'll definitely satisfies you longer 

892
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:40,880
to.
And it just like the craving for carbs.

893
00:43:40,881 --> 00:43:41,714
Like uh,
I got off of it when I went on this 

894
00:43:43,341 --> 00:43:44,174
trip.
I went on a trip and I was with these 

895
00:43:47,241 --> 00:43:51,230
guys camping for six days and there just
wasn't,

896
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:52,333
there's no way.
I mean it was just so much food that 

897
00:43:53,571 --> 00:43:56,540
wasn't key to genic yeah.
And that's all we had was that food.

898
00:43:56,930 --> 00:43:57,763
So I got off it and the first thing I 
noticed is like how hungry would get in 

899
00:44:01,851 --> 00:44:03,680
between meals.
Sugar spikes.

900
00:44:04,070 --> 00:44:04,940
Yeah.
Like you get like,

901
00:44:04,941 --> 00:44:06,080
god damn it,
I got to eat.

902
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:07,340
And I realized like,
wow,

903
00:44:07,341 --> 00:44:08,174
I don't get that when I'm on the fat 
based diet and as soon as I got on the 

904
00:44:10,461 --> 00:44:12,410
fat based diet again,
it went away.

905
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:13,341
My son,
you know,

906
00:44:13,341 --> 00:44:14,174
what are my second day of cutting the 
sugar and stuff was when we did that 

907
00:44:17,781 --> 00:44:22,170
live podcast and I was snapping at.
Everybody was so grumpy.

908
00:44:22,190 --> 00:44:23,410
Oh,
did you get like heroin?

909
00:44:23,450 --> 00:44:24,770
Like,
dude,

910
00:44:24,771 --> 00:44:29,000
I didn't mean I didn't realize how much 
sugar I was consuming regularly.

911
00:44:29,530 --> 00:44:32,310
But the first 48 to 72

912
00:44:32,310 --> 00:44:35,220
hours when I was about to be on the 
first 48,

913
00:44:35,410 --> 00:44:39,330
I was fucking.
I was really snapping at me.

914
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:40,570
Yeah man.
I know.

915
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,570
It was just,
I couldn't control it.

916
00:44:42,571 --> 00:44:45,480
I also had a really hard time focusing,
you know,

917
00:44:45,630 --> 00:44:47,490
for those first couple of days.
Yeah.

918
00:44:47,491 --> 00:44:49,260
They,
they called the keto flu.

919
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:50,270
really?

920
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:51,680
Yeah.
You feel like you have the flu?

921
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:54,290
I had a buddy of mine,
my friend brendan tried it,

922
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:56,600
not brenda chubb and other brendan.
Um,

923
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:58,580
and um,
when he tried it,

924
00:44:58,581 --> 00:44:59,990
he was like,
he sent me a text message.

925
00:44:59,991 --> 00:45:01,370
It's like,
do you feel shitty?

926
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:03,470
Like,
do you feel like tired?

927
00:45:03,530 --> 00:45:04,370
Uh,
when you're,

928
00:45:04,371 --> 00:45:06,710
when you're first doing this,
like some people it hits him like really

929
00:45:06,711 --> 00:45:08,390
bad.
I was just really irritable.

930
00:45:09,030 --> 00:45:10,120
Yeah.
Really irritable.

931
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,740
You're jonesing.
Yeah,

932
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:13,180
I wanted it bad,
man.

933
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:15,430
Yeah.
So bad.

934
00:45:15,940 --> 00:45:18,730
And you forget all the stuff that has 
sugar in it.

935
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:21,200
That's everything for anything.
Does it.

936
00:45:21,290 --> 00:45:24,730
Actually the cool other cool part about 
it besides the health benefits me,

937
00:45:24,740 --> 00:45:26,410
you know,
from what I've read,

938
00:45:26,411 --> 00:45:28,630
a lot of people's,
all their cholesterol goes down,

939
00:45:28,631 --> 00:45:29,464
all that stuff goes down.
It's a good exercise in discipline and 

940
00:45:34,870 --> 00:45:38,620
in being focused and mindful in 
something that's the cool part.

941
00:45:38,740 --> 00:45:39,370
If you're not,
like,

942
00:45:39,370 --> 00:45:42,130
I'm not a super disciplined person about
a lot of things,

943
00:45:42,350 --> 00:45:43,870
you know,
I'm disciplined about work,

944
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:49,300
but like I don't find myself to be super
disciplined and all sudden you're going,

945
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:51,250
all right,
I have to look at what's in this.

946
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:52,870
And then you're starting to catch 
things.

947
00:45:52,990 --> 00:45:53,823
It makes you more focused overall 
because you're focused on trying to do 

948
00:45:57,820 --> 00:46:00,430
this one.
Like I want to eliminate sugar,

949
00:46:00,431 --> 00:46:03,050
which he secretly in everything you 
know,

950
00:46:03,070 --> 00:46:04,720
I think a lot of addictions,

951
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:05,650
they,
they,

952
00:46:05,650 --> 00:46:06,483
they're all almost the same thing.
It's the same pattern and that pattern 

953
00:46:10,331 --> 00:46:13,390
is you're just doing something and you 
can't even believe you're doing it while

954
00:46:13,391 --> 00:46:15,400
you're doing it.
And I'm betting all on black,

955
00:46:17,010 --> 00:46:17,843
like whether it's gambling or whether 
it's sex or whether it's drugs or 

956
00:46:21,521 --> 00:46:22,840
whether it's a.
I mean,

957
00:46:22,841 --> 00:46:25,150
people are addicted to a bunch of 
different weird shit.

958
00:46:25,170 --> 00:46:26,770
yeah.
And food is a big one.

959
00:46:26,771 --> 00:46:27,700
It's a big one,
man.

960
00:46:27,790 --> 00:46:29,670
It's kinda the same thing.
They're just caught up in it.

961
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:33,270
And then after you're done,
you're like,

962
00:46:33,271 --> 00:46:37,200
what the fuck did I do?
What did I do before I had a baby?

963
00:46:37,201 --> 00:46:38,034
I had so much free time and I didn't 
realize how much of that time I just 

964
00:46:41,041 --> 00:46:46,041
spent eating,
just snacking on shit that I did not.

965
00:46:47,521 --> 00:46:49,530
And now I don't have the time to,
you know,

966
00:46:49,531 --> 00:46:52,740
you lose the baby weight gradually.
It wasn't an effort because it's,

967
00:46:52,741 --> 00:46:53,574
I don't have fucking time.
I used to graze out of boredom or 

968
00:46:56,011 --> 00:46:58,680
depression or on the road or whatever.
And then,

969
00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:01,230
you know,
you don't need to eat half the shit.

970
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:02,850
I don't need you to have the shit I was 
eating.

971
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:06,600
It's simple mouth poser.
And that's when you got to look at it.

972
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:07,973
There's two,
two different things going on at the 

973
00:47:09,051 --> 00:47:10,040
same time.
One,

974
00:47:10,041 --> 00:47:10,874
there's a simple mouth pleasure that 
like when you eat lasagna or something 

975
00:47:14,061 --> 00:47:14,894
like that.

976
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:19,120
Oh I couldN't even do it last week.
It was too many carbs.

977
00:47:19,121 --> 00:47:22,030
I felt like it was so heavy though.
I miss pasta.

978
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:24,870
So good.
You know what I broke on for

979
00:47:24,870 --> 00:47:28,210
a day and i just had a little bit.
I love like a.

980
00:47:28,660 --> 00:47:30,100
Oh really?
Like

981
00:47:30,170 --> 00:47:32,680
the proper really made way rice,
like a,

982
00:47:32,710 --> 00:47:34,670
like a rice that's made,
you know,

983
00:47:34,750 --> 00:47:38,950
not like quick rice but like boiled and 
so what makes rice perfect?

984
00:47:39,380 --> 00:47:41,560
Our guatemalan nanny did it?
Yeah.

985
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:42,600
Had.
Yeah,

986
00:47:42,610 --> 00:47:45,130
I had to.
I was like I got to have cheese steak in

987
00:47:45,131 --> 00:47:47,800
philly on saturday night.
Catch her life.

988
00:47:47,801 --> 00:47:49,410
How was,
that was awesome.

989
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,050
Go.
Are you gonna?

990
00:47:51,051 --> 00:47:54,560
Give him a plug.
I think it was jim's jim.

991
00:47:54,570 --> 00:47:56,200
Jim's jim steak.
yeah,

992
00:47:56,300 --> 00:47:57,133
it's good.
Me and tony found like the place that 

993
00:47:58,601 --> 00:47:59,434
had the most authentic reviews.
That's a from my instagram with them 

994
00:48:02,951 --> 00:48:04,810
cooking it in front of you.
Come on,

995
00:48:04,811 --> 00:48:06,460
son.
Put cheese was on it,

996
00:48:06,490 --> 00:48:07,323
which in retrospect was a mistake.
I should have gone with provolone and 

997
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:13,350
the guy who was like,
do you want to try wiz?

998
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:14,590
Like what does that?
He goes,

999
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:15,424
cheez whiz.
I go,

1000
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:15,850
really?

1001
00:48:15,850 --> 00:48:16,750
He goes,
that's how we use.

1002
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:18,760
That's how we originally.
Jeanne moves.

1003
00:48:18,761 --> 00:48:20,830
Yeah.
I always thought that was disgusting.

1004
00:48:21,370 --> 00:48:23,800
Processed cheese.
I'm real white trash though.

1005
00:48:23,801 --> 00:48:26,190
I like all that stuff.
I like shaky cheese.

1006
00:48:26,220 --> 00:48:29,380
It just doesn't taste as good.
Prevalent tastes better.

1007
00:48:29,410 --> 00:48:32,110
Way about daycare,
chopped onions,

1008
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:34,090
onions,
peppers,

1009
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:39,500
mushrooms to jeff over skippy or I liked
that.

1010
00:48:40,631 --> 00:48:42,490
No sugar.
Peanut butter that you have to stick the

1011
00:48:42,491 --> 00:48:47,290
knife in and make your countertop oil.
Do it yourself.

1012
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:48,273
I liked that stuff we had to go to.
If you had to go skippy or jeff is kind 

1013
00:48:51,191 --> 00:48:52,870
of a battle for it.
Who'd you go with?

1014
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:59,440
Skippy?
Skippy.

1015
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:01,533
Peanut.
Dear.

1016
00:49:02,150 --> 00:49:05,350
Miss jiffy is like a little bit more 
sugary,

1017
00:49:05,530 --> 00:49:09,400
but jeff is more peanutty be.
Maybe I got those reversed,

1018
00:49:09,430 --> 00:49:14,230
but skippy does taste more process,
but I like the taste.

1019
00:49:14,310 --> 00:49:15,550
Yeah,
it does taste more product,

1020
00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:16,920
right?
yes,

1021
00:49:17,940 --> 00:49:18,773
yes,
that's right.

1022
00:49:19,060 --> 00:49:20,920
So now you're correcting yourself.
I got it.

1023
00:49:20,921 --> 00:49:21,754
So your team.
I'm just keeping it because it's like 

1024
00:49:26,111 --> 00:49:27,280
candy.
I'm eating candy.

1025
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,680
No,
I'm not really eating peanut butter,

1026
00:49:30,630 --> 00:49:35,630
peanut butter,
but it's like peanut butter cups and for

1027
00:49:37,990 --> 00:49:42,680
like 20 years we never knew basically 
that that's not really whipping.

1028
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:44,370
It tastes like,
you know,

1029
00:49:45,070 --> 00:49:49,810
having it and you're like this is candy.
Peanut butter is candy is like,

1030
00:49:49,811 --> 00:49:52,060
no,
it's not supposed to taste like as a kid

1031
00:49:52,061 --> 00:49:55,180
and your lunch and it was just sugar 
layer and then a sugar layer.

1032
00:49:55,950 --> 00:49:57,760
Well when I was a kid,
my parents.

1033
00:49:59,390 --> 00:50:00,700
Yeah,
my parents,

1034
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:04,620
my parents were hippies when I was kid 
and they may be healthy and so really?

1035
00:50:04,670 --> 00:50:06,550
Yeah.
My stepdad was a total hippie.

1036
00:50:06,551 --> 00:50:08,720
Like you had hair down to his ass.
Oh.

1037
00:50:08,770 --> 00:50:11,440
And my mom was a hippie too.
We lived in san francisco the whole deal

1038
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:12,393
and we ate wheat bread with that fucking
nasty peanut butter that you have to 

1039
00:50:14,651 --> 00:50:17,440
start with a knife and when you're a 
little kid you're so pumped.

1040
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:18,293
Products white bread with jelly goes 
into the bread and like it turns like 

1041
00:50:23,890 --> 00:50:26,920
it's like you ever see like a nice 
smoked meat where it,

1042
00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:28,010
that layer on the

1043
00:50:28,010 --> 00:50:30,440
outside of the darkness and it's like a 
ring,

1044
00:50:30,441 --> 00:50:35,441
like a smoke wing but a peanut butter 
and jelly sandwich on like wonder bread.

1045
00:50:35,890 --> 00:50:38,530
That jelly starts to leak into the 
bread.

1046
00:50:41,180 --> 00:50:45,590
Yeah.
But those will melt in your mouth.

1047
00:50:45,591 --> 00:50:49,810
You wouldn't eat a peanut butter and 
jelly sandwich on jeff with willows with

1048
00:50:49,850 --> 00:50:54,230
on the less with wonderbread rather on,
with a glass of milk.

1049
00:50:54,860 --> 00:50:59,860
So she had like cold war lunches from 
her to tell him what you had for lunch.

1050
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:03,080
So my parents,
my parents split.

1051
00:51:03,081 --> 00:51:07,130
I live with my dad for a few years and 
like he would make me lunch.

1052
00:51:07,131 --> 00:51:07,964
It was a cut piece of bread off of like 
a low of some eastern european rye with 

1053
00:51:11,901 --> 00:51:16,901
no seat and then butter and then salami 
on butter.

1054
00:51:17,780 --> 00:51:18,613
Which is just grease on greased,
like my stomach would hurt a kid to go 

1055
00:51:21,591 --> 00:51:26,540
to lunch.
Just have these cold like this,

1056
00:51:26,570 --> 00:51:28,940
this with butter,
butter,

1057
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:32,910
jelly and butter daily.

1058
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:35,180
He just says you should eat the way he 
eats.

1059
00:51:35,340 --> 00:51:36,220
He.
He's like,

1060
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:37,470
he looks great,
looks great.

1061
00:51:37,860 --> 00:51:40,750
He has cold boss again,
like you know,

1062
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:45,760
basically super fatty sausage and then 
like he's like onions,

1063
00:51:46,850 --> 00:51:48,800
beer.
Where's he get his bread?

1064
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:52,040
These loaves of bread while there's a 
place here in woodland hills.

1065
00:51:52,041 --> 00:51:54,920
It's called the german cold cuts.
It's on topanga canyon.

1066
00:51:54,950 --> 00:51:57,950
I grew up going there.
It's a tiny little german place and it's

1067
00:51:57,951 --> 00:52:00,380
rye with no seeds.
Then there's another one,

1068
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:03,890
a burbank.
It's another german slash hungarian.

1069
00:52:03,891 --> 00:52:07,190
They got all the treats and my dad is he
like,

1070
00:52:07,191 --> 00:52:10,730
we have cockroach dna,
like we're eastern blockers.

1071
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:12,193
My,
I have relatives who one guy drives a 

1072
00:52:14,091 --> 00:52:15,590
cab,
80 years old,

1073
00:52:15,591 --> 00:52:18,890
never exercised.
Drinks a liter of vodka every day.

1074
00:52:18,891 --> 00:52:19,724
Small like it's just our family.
I do think that was because she never 

1075
00:52:22,551 --> 00:52:23,384
gets sick.
now I'll get like a fucking flew and go 

1076
00:52:27,110 --> 00:52:30,070
to the hospital and she's like,
like sniffs for a couple of days.

1077
00:52:30,070 --> 00:52:33,590
She's like,
I bet your people survive strong.

1078
00:52:33,591 --> 00:52:36,560
Like bull zilliant.
Think about like,

1079
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:37,753
like eastern block people.
Some of the hardiest people will you 

1080
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:43,430
think like hardy white system most 
tender,

1081
00:52:43,740 --> 00:52:46,400
the sweetest and the most kind and 
affectionate pupil.

1082
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:50,960
That's the thing I don't like though is 
that my parents are just so cold.

1083
00:52:51,020 --> 00:52:51,853
Like my step mom used to get offended 
when waiters would come to the table at 

1084
00:52:55,491 --> 00:52:57,320
a restaurant and be like,
what's up folks?

1085
00:52:57,420 --> 00:52:59,390
For like,
what the fuck?

1086
00:52:59,391 --> 00:53:00,530
You folks like,
they're,

1087
00:53:01,650 --> 00:53:04,430
they think that it's weakness to be 
friendly.

1088
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:05,811
Hi,
how are you?

1089
00:53:05,811 --> 00:53:07,700
They just think you're dumb.
Wow.

1090
00:53:07,701 --> 00:53:11,030
They went through many wars.
People went through too much chaos,

1091
00:53:11,060 --> 00:53:12,370
too much,
too much trauma.

1092
00:53:12,380 --> 00:53:17,380
How to be hard for a lot of cold stares.
It's my step,

1093
00:53:17,751 --> 00:53:20,930
my step mom he didn't like.
Or do you think that's.

1094
00:53:20,931 --> 00:53:24,530
Why do you think russians admire putin?
Because.

1095
00:53:24,770 --> 00:53:26,100
But do think they admire him

1096
00:53:26,190 --> 00:53:27,330
because,
uh,

1097
00:53:27,331 --> 00:53:28,164
they're scared.
Do you think they admire them because 

1098
00:53:30,301 --> 00:53:31,134
they,
they actually admire that hard ass 

1099
00:53:33,980 --> 00:53:36,000
motherfucker.
It's a cultural thing.

1100
00:53:36,001 --> 00:53:41,001
He'd be seen as a pussy if he were to be
like our obama.

1101
00:53:41,341 --> 00:53:44,100
Hey,
that stuff is considered like,

1102
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:48,950
what are you are scared to come on?
Well,

1103
00:53:48,951 --> 00:53:50,210
he,
he like jackson.

1104
00:53:50,211 --> 00:53:51,044
No,
he checks these guys that are 

1105
00:53:52,021 --> 00:53:55,770
billionaires like he takes over the 
companies and puts them in jail.

1106
00:53:55,980 --> 00:54:00,980
There's no reason to be scared that 
they'd been scared for so many leaders.

1107
00:54:01,830 --> 00:54:02,251
I mean,
look,

1108
00:54:02,251 --> 00:54:03,084
they've been through communism.
And how did you guys see you gotta 

1109
00:54:05,411 --> 00:54:07,560
remember this?
Did you go see the assassination attempt

1110
00:54:07,561 --> 00:54:08,640
on him recently?
No,

1111
00:54:08,670 --> 00:54:09,503
no,
no.

1112
00:54:09,540 --> 00:54:11,160
Oh my god.
It's crazy.

1113
00:54:11,161 --> 00:54:11,994
I'm prudent.
Somebody did a suicide assassination 

1114
00:54:13,411 --> 00:54:14,244
attempt on putin and the way they did it
is they were driving on the opposite 

1115
00:54:16,831 --> 00:54:19,950
side of the highway and they drove head 
on into his car.

1116
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:22,380
Wow.
He's on one side.

1117
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:23,273
Then on the other side,
and they had a median and this guy 

1118
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:30,090
drives in the center of the median,
like before the putin's car comes.

1119
00:54:30,091 --> 00:54:31,770
And when he sees putin's car turns right
into it.

1120
00:54:31,980 --> 00:54:35,610
So he knew it was that car and putin 
wasn't in the car,

1121
00:54:35,790 --> 00:54:36,623
but his driver,
his driver was and his driver was 

1122
00:54:38,371 --> 00:54:39,690
killed.
Oh wow.

1123
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:40,820
Yeah,
that's crazy.

1124
00:54:41,010 --> 00:54:41,843
Is there a video of this was a couple of
videos from a couple of different 

1125
00:54:44,731 --> 00:54:45,564
angles.
It's crazy because dashboard cameras 

1126
00:54:47,671 --> 00:54:48,540
they have over there.
No,

1127
00:54:48,541 --> 00:54:48,820
no,
no.

1128
00:54:48,820 --> 00:54:51,570
This is like a street cameras so you can
see the cars.

1129
00:54:51,660 --> 00:54:54,540
You could see the cars and they see them
slamming each other.

1130
00:54:54,541 --> 00:54:55,730
I mean they're going like 80 miles an 
hour,

1131
00:54:55,740 --> 00:54:57,880
both sides and is uh,
uh,

1132
00:54:58,440 --> 00:54:59,273
putin's.
But it is this vehicle like lead and 

1133
00:55:02,581 --> 00:55:03,900
trailed by escort,
you know,

1134
00:55:03,901 --> 00:55:04,650
by security or.

1135
00:55:04,650 --> 00:55:05,670
No,
that's a good question.

1136
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:08,130
I don't know because putting wasn't in 
the car.

1137
00:55:09,620 --> 00:55:12,240
Maybe they thought he was in the car,
maybe that maybe they had a heads up and

1138
00:55:12,241 --> 00:55:13,500
they knew something was going on.
I mean,

1139
00:55:13,501 --> 00:55:14,820
who the fuck knows,
I dunno.

1140
00:55:15,090 --> 00:55:16,410
Maybe they put them in a bunch of 
different,

1141
00:55:16,590 --> 00:55:18,180
you know,
had a bunch of different cars,

1142
00:55:18,330 --> 00:55:21,510
but you could see here here,
roll it back and he watched this.

1143
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:23,910
Boom,
that guy did that on purpose.

1144
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:25,920
Roll it back again,
jamie,

1145
00:55:26,580 --> 00:55:29,460
why does that thing keeps shutting off 
something wrong with the connector.

1146
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:31,240
Boom.
See that?

1147
00:55:31,241 --> 00:55:33,060
Oh yeah.
It's crazy.

1148
00:55:33,450 --> 00:55:35,640
So there's a couple different angles of 
it,

1149
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:40,020
but the guy leg literally just drove 
right into the other lane,

1150
00:55:40,260 --> 00:55:42,480
so that was new for sure.
That was,

1151
00:55:42,860 --> 00:55:44,780
I mean obviously to target that.
Wow.

1152
00:55:44,910 --> 00:55:45,743
New for sure.
To target it and knew for sure he was 

1153
00:55:47,071 --> 00:55:48,950
going to die.
Watch this.

1154
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:50,033
Boom.

1155
00:55:51,660 --> 00:55:52,860
Wow.
Yeah,

1156
00:55:53,550 --> 00:55:55,800
they're both dead.
I'm pretty sure.

1157
00:55:56,910 --> 00:56:01,420
I mean the also just the precision of 
knowing jesus christ and the timing that

1158
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:04,710
I really get your timing right.
How did they know?

1159
00:56:04,711 --> 00:56:06,540
I mean there must've been other people 
involved.

1160
00:56:06,810 --> 00:56:08,220
What am I seeing?
Yeah.

1161
00:56:08,460 --> 00:56:10,110
Wow.
Scary.

1162
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:16,560
He's a.
He's a fascinating figure.

1163
00:56:16,710 --> 00:56:19,950
It's the when those people exist in this
day and age,

1164
00:56:19,951 --> 00:56:24,610
like kim jong wound,
like when that guy exists in 2016,

1165
00:56:24,611 --> 00:56:26,890
it makes you really stop and think like,
wow,

1166
00:56:27,310 --> 00:56:31,000
he's a dictator of a whole country.
They're all terrified of him.

1167
00:56:31,001 --> 00:56:31,834
Did you see when North Korea 
accidentally let all of its websites 

1168
00:56:35,111 --> 00:56:37,750
have become available for a brief moment
of time?

1169
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:38,793
They have 28 websites,
there's only 28 websites and the 

1170
00:56:42,341 --> 00:56:44,230
internet in North Korea.
Yeah,

1171
00:56:44,350 --> 00:56:47,200
so the people that live in North Korea,
they think that's the internet.

1172
00:56:47,740 --> 00:56:49,420
It's got to be there.
All state run websites.

1173
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:50,050
Yeah,
yeah,

1174
00:56:50,050 --> 00:56:50,950
yeah,
yeah.

1175
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:51,793
There's a list of them,
but they made a list of the websites 

1176
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:58,200
that are.
They like a kingdom on his handsome.com

1177
00:56:58,220 --> 00:56:59,053
because I know is super fast runner.com.
You meant that it became free for a 

1178
00:57:03,851 --> 00:57:04,990
minute and I was like,
oh,

1179
00:57:04,991 --> 00:57:09,370
I wonder how much porn was downloaded.
Like could you imagine?

1180
00:57:10,090 --> 00:57:12,010
It would be insane.
I think it was.

1181
00:57:12,410 --> 00:57:15,100
They just fucked up and let the rest of 
the world look at it.

1182
00:57:15,250 --> 00:57:16,083
Wow.
I saw that documentary were like this 

1183
00:57:20,140 --> 00:57:25,140
big thing is that the south koreans will
put films on flash drives films.

1184
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:27,993
Yeah.
Movies on flash drives and then sneak 

1185
00:57:31,630 --> 00:57:33,310
flashdrives oh,
over in North Korea.

1186
00:57:33,311 --> 00:57:35,810
And so that they can see like other,
you know,

1187
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:39,670
others countries like landscapes,
movies,

1188
00:57:39,671 --> 00:57:41,970
like just.
And it just blows their minds.

1189
00:57:42,790 --> 00:57:46,390
I want to see what the websites were.
Did you find what the websites where?

1190
00:57:46,830 --> 00:57:47,980
This wasn't a great list on here.

1191
00:57:47,980 --> 00:57:49,380
I was going.
Oh,

1192
00:57:49,410 --> 00:57:50,890
okay.
Yeah.

1193
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:53,590
They have 28 websites,
man.

1194
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:56,190
Wow.
Bananas.

1195
00:57:56,670 --> 00:57:57,920
It is all came.
There was that.

1196
00:57:57,940 --> 00:58:02,080
There was a cooking one showed up and 
then korean films.

1197
00:58:02,770 --> 00:58:05,320
Wow.
It's really strange.

1198
00:58:05,321 --> 00:58:06,640
Young guns,
super long.

1199
00:58:06,641 --> 00:58:10,610
Dick.com.
Rudimentary.

1200
00:58:11,540 --> 00:58:12,373
Why the mentoree web design skills that 
are a hallmark of north korea's online 

1201
00:58:15,671 --> 00:58:17,110
presence.
Yeah.

1202
00:58:17,350 --> 00:58:18,183
In fact,
many of the websites appeared to have 

1203
00:58:18,911 --> 00:58:21,670
stopped functioning at all by wednesday 
morning.

1204
00:58:21,730 --> 00:58:26,380
Wow.
What an insane world we live in.

1205
00:58:26,530 --> 00:58:29,500
That really is the most.
It's so sad when you think about that.

1206
00:58:29,501 --> 00:58:31,870
That's someone's whole existence to live
there.

1207
00:58:32,020 --> 00:58:36,370
What did you see when kim jong il died?
How fucking crazy that was.

1208
00:58:36,740 --> 00:58:39,430
They would go to jail.
You'd be sentenced to jail if you didn't

1209
00:58:39,431 --> 00:58:41,500
cry enough [inaudible].

1210
00:58:42,850 --> 00:58:44,740
They felt like you weren't crying 
enough.

1211
00:58:44,741 --> 00:58:47,980
they would throw you in jail.
So it was to see if you can find this in

1212
00:58:48,110 --> 00:58:49,900
the morning.
It's insane.

1213
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:54,910
FaLling down on the streets.
What is amazing about North Korea is how

1214
00:58:54,911 --> 00:58:55,744
they contain it like that.
Because my father grew up in communism 

1215
00:58:58,511 --> 00:58:59,344
in Hungary,
but they could still hear like the 

1216
00:59:01,541 --> 00:59:03,010
beatles and shit,
you know,

1217
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:04,353
they still had access this way here.
This is so crazy watching all these 

1218
00:59:07,691 --> 00:59:11,860
people lined up crying and they have to 
cry for like long periods of time.

1219
00:59:11,861 --> 00:59:14,050
Like if you stopped crying too early,
they'll put you in jail.

1220
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:19,080
People were arrested at these events for
not crying enough.

1221
00:59:19,750 --> 00:59:20,860
God damn it,
man.

1222
00:59:21,250 --> 00:59:22,350
Yeah.
It's so scary.

1223
00:59:22,390 --> 00:59:24,980
It's going to get arrested on the end 
there for crying.

1224
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:26,840
I didn't see him crying up.
No.

1225
00:59:27,070 --> 00:59:30,080
Yeah dude.
Because blowing his nose on the show.

1226
00:59:30,081 --> 00:59:32,270
A little emotion guys.
that's a good one.

1227
00:59:32,780 --> 00:59:36,260
That's an exemplary [inaudible] like a 
pentecostal guy in tongues.

1228
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:41,150
Oh my god.
Yeah.

1229
00:59:41,420 --> 00:59:42,980
Wow.
You know,

1230
00:59:43,070 --> 00:59:47,120
North Korea has allegedly,
this might all be us propaganda.

1231
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:47,991
No,
the,

1232
00:59:47,991 --> 00:59:48,824
uh,
allegedly have these prison camps where 

1233
00:59:50,841 --> 00:59:53,630
people are born.
They're born into it.

1234
00:59:53,631 --> 00:59:58,040
And this one guy got free and gave all 
this testimony,

1235
00:59:58,041 --> 01:00:00,220
explained like what it was like in those
camps.

1236
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:01,073
Now he turned his own mother in for 
something that she had done and they 

1237
01:00:03,921 --> 01:00:04,754
showed like how um,
different jobs are given to different 

1238
01:00:07,581 --> 01:00:11,600
people depending on what level of 
decrepitude nis there is.

1239
01:00:11,601 --> 01:00:13,040
That a word.
Sure.

1240
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:15,290
To credit precedent,
decrepit,

1241
01:00:15,810 --> 01:00:20,810
decrepit to take the lead on that one.
A fucked up at nus.

1242
01:00:22,430 --> 01:00:24,470
That's the word.
How much you've,

1243
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:26,450
you know,
decayed.

1244
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:30,140
I mean they're not starving people out 
and then they would feed them to dogs.

1245
01:00:30,230 --> 01:00:32,930
Oh my god.
this guy was showing the levels,

1246
01:00:32,931 --> 01:00:33,764
like he drew pictures of like what 
people looked like when they would do 

1247
01:00:35,871 --> 01:00:38,540
certain jobs and once you couldn't do 
physical labor anymore,

1248
01:00:39,050 --> 01:00:41,060
they would just fucking fed to animals.

1249
01:00:41,300 --> 01:00:42,133
It's really,
they also do this thing where like if 

1250
01:00:44,151 --> 01:00:47,930
you fuck up or let's say you escape,
you were a north korean citizen,

1251
01:00:47,931 --> 01:00:48,764
you escape,
they would go round up your family and 

1252
01:00:52,970 --> 01:00:53,803
put them in jail and they have a two 
generation policy there so that your 

1253
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:04,130
kids and their kids will live in the 
labor camps.

1254
01:01:04,500 --> 01:01:06,920
Jesus,
during communism,

1255
01:01:06,921 --> 01:01:07,754
my dad said that they would encourage 
the children at school to rat out their 

1256
01:01:11,391 --> 01:01:14,510
parents if they heard,
if you hear your parents saying anything

1257
01:01:14,511 --> 01:01:15,344
against the government,
you're supposed to write your parents 

1258
01:01:17,151 --> 01:01:21,200
out and that kids would end up doing 
that and then they come to your door and

1259
01:01:21,201 --> 01:01:23,870
take.
I think that thing is called escape from

1260
01:01:23,871 --> 01:01:24,704
camp 19 or escape from camp 14 that that
guy got free and then he was still 

1261
01:01:30,591 --> 01:01:31,424
living as though he was in North Korea.
He preferred I'm sleeping on the floor 

1262
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:37,190
because he slept on the floor for like 
25 years,

1263
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:40,220
you know,
and he couldn't adapt.

1264
01:01:40,220 --> 01:01:41,053
He just couldn't escape from something 
came out about him later that he had 

1265
01:01:47,931 --> 01:01:51,260
made up some things.
Not that his whole story was made up,

1266
01:01:51,270 --> 01:01:52,103
but he fabricated something.
I would imagine that if you lived in a 

1267
01:01:55,251 --> 01:01:58,100
prison camp your whole life,
you have some serious mental illness.

1268
01:01:58,160 --> 01:01:58,993
Oh yeah.
The idea that we could think that this 

1269
01:02:01,131 --> 01:02:04,370
guy is going to be saying that we hold 
them up to some sort of standard.

1270
01:02:04,371 --> 01:02:05,680
Well,
you can't even buy what he said.

1271
01:02:05,730 --> 01:02:06,563
Don't you know,
he said his biggest fantasy was in that 

1272
01:02:12,730 --> 01:02:14,830
month eating meat.
Whoa.

1273
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:17,840
Like that's what he would dream about.
Going to get a steak.

1274
01:02:18,020 --> 01:02:19,070
Oh my god.
Yeah.

1275
01:02:21,450 --> 01:02:22,283
2016.
They still doing that to people right 

1276
01:02:23,971 --> 01:02:25,130
now.
It's crazy.

1277
01:02:25,950 --> 01:02:26,701
Yeah.
Well,

1278
01:02:26,701 --> 01:02:28,670
you know,
I had George Perez on,

1279
01:02:29,070 --> 01:02:30,770
you know George Perez is dynamic.
Yeah.

1280
01:02:31,050 --> 01:02:34,320
Jordan did some time in jail.
He did a long time ago.

1281
01:02:34,380 --> 01:02:35,460
Yeah,
a few years back.

1282
01:02:36,030 --> 01:02:38,610
Early two thousands for a fight at a 
basketball game.

1283
01:02:38,940 --> 01:02:39,773
Wow.
Some street basketball game beat some 

1284
01:02:41,131 --> 01:02:45,390
dude up and then years later he was on 
mtv and the dude saw him on tv and heard

1285
01:02:45,391 --> 01:02:48,450
about that and that's how he got 
arrested.

1286
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:50,860
He got arrested and then he did.
He did prison time.

1287
01:02:50,910 --> 01:02:53,010
I did three years.
Shit.

1288
01:02:53,040 --> 01:02:56,220
He's fucking hilarious by the way.
And it stories are hilarious.

1289
01:02:56,221 --> 01:02:57,750
He's just a funny,
funny dude.

1290
01:02:57,840 --> 01:03:00,090
But um,
when he was talking about prison,

1291
01:03:00,120 --> 01:03:00,953
it got me thinking like he was talking 
about how much people make and he was 

1292
01:03:04,711 --> 01:03:06,810
talking like thirty eight cents an hour 
or something like that.

1293
01:03:06,820 --> 01:03:07,650
Like there's not one of them.

1294
01:03:07,650 --> 01:03:12,650
One of the things that he said something
ridiculously low and then I'm like,

1295
01:03:12,841 --> 01:03:15,030
okay,
how is that not slavery?

1296
01:03:15,810 --> 01:03:16,643
Like how were You like you not only are 
you putting someone in jail where they 

1297
01:03:20,461 --> 01:03:24,420
can't go anywhere,
but you are forcing them to work at this

1298
01:03:24,421 --> 01:03:27,600
insanely low rate that no one would ever
worked for.

1299
01:03:27,690 --> 01:03:28,523
ThAt's true.
Like when you look at the definition of 

1300
01:03:29,971 --> 01:03:30,900
slavery,
if you say,

1301
01:03:30,901 --> 01:03:32,370
well,
slavery ended in 18,

1302
01:03:32,371 --> 01:03:35,400
65.
How has slavery done in 18,

1303
01:03:35,401 --> 01:03:39,390
65 when you have men literally in chain 
gangs breaking,

1304
01:03:39,391 --> 01:03:41,280
right?
While we wrote it down on paper,

1305
01:03:41,670 --> 01:03:45,030
so you know,
well this guy robbed a purse or whatever

1306
01:03:45,031 --> 01:03:46,710
reason.
You put those people in.

1307
01:03:46,830 --> 01:03:50,520
Yeah,
I mean either killed them or you know,

1308
01:03:50,570 --> 01:03:53,940
like you can't.
You can't force someone to break rocks.

1309
01:03:54,040 --> 01:03:54,873
Right?
you can't force them to work for thirty 

1310
01:03:56,470 --> 01:03:59,130
cents an hour,
whatever it is that still in places some

1311
01:03:59,131 --> 01:04:01,320
places.
I think that the law,

1312
01:04:01,380 --> 01:04:03,760
one of the last places that still,
or I don't know if they're still doing,

1313
01:04:03,770 --> 01:04:04,603
wasn't Louisiana,
was that Louisiana prison that's really 

1314
01:04:06,301 --> 01:04:07,920
famous.
They had chain gangs.

1315
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:10,890
They made the inmates were pink and 
stuff.

1316
01:04:10,980 --> 01:04:12,330
No,
that's in an Arizona.

1317
01:04:12,450 --> 01:04:15,310
that's just joe our pio,
right?

1318
01:04:15,360 --> 01:04:17,090
Yeah.
That guy's crazy.

1319
01:04:17,100 --> 01:04:19,650
Chef joe.
That's where Mike Tyson had to go.

1320
01:04:19,830 --> 01:04:21,100
He went there.
Mike tyson.

1321
01:04:21,101 --> 01:04:24,270
That'll wear pink.
And you got caught with cocaine.

1322
01:04:24,550 --> 01:04:25,383
Was it coke?

1323
01:04:27,500 --> 01:04:29,520
Yeah.
Pink pink.

1324
01:04:30,150 --> 01:04:31,920
How to do a couple of days,
but it was,

1325
01:04:31,921 --> 01:04:33,690
you know,
one of those approval point type things.

1326
01:04:34,010 --> 01:04:34,843
Wow.
That even Mike Tyson has to wear the 

1327
01:04:35,821 --> 01:04:39,000
pink.
This is stupid,

1328
01:04:39,001 --> 01:04:41,190
but their commissaries cheaper.
Right?

1329
01:04:41,191 --> 01:04:45,930
Like maybe it's all adjusted for 
prisoners like that.

1330
01:04:46,110 --> 01:04:48,150
America is only female.
What chain?

1331
01:04:48,151 --> 01:04:48,984
Gang.
The women who pull weeds and barry 

1332
01:04:50,191 --> 01:04:55,191
unclaimed bodies and at what burry 
unclaimed bodies that come up.

1333
01:04:55,680 --> 01:04:57,720
That's number to pull weeds.
Number one.

1334
01:04:57,721 --> 01:05:00,210
Barry unclaimed bodies number two.
Number three,

1335
01:05:00,490 --> 01:05:01,323
pick up cans back in the Arizona desert 
to avoid 23 hours of lockdown and 

1336
01:05:07,131 --> 01:05:09,330
country's toughest jail.
Wow.

1337
01:05:09,331 --> 01:05:14,331
They're all chained up.
Just you gotta wonder like at what?

1338
01:05:16,410 --> 01:05:18,460
At what point is it slavery?

1339
01:05:19,120 --> 01:05:22,600
I'm wondering which one of these girls 
would be my prison girlfriend thing.

1340
01:05:22,630 --> 01:05:27,630
Tom body body.
So this is probably the glasses I'd hook

1341
01:05:28,391 --> 01:05:29,224
up with that shakes.
This is probably like people that are 

1342
01:05:31,391 --> 01:05:36,070
border crossing and the lineups are 
dying out there.

1343
01:05:36,130 --> 01:05:38,230
That's got to be so brutal.
Oh my god.

1344
01:05:38,290 --> 01:05:42,930
Through Arizona in the summer.
You ever go to phoenix in the summer and

1345
01:05:42,940 --> 01:05:43,990
you're like,
oh okay,

1346
01:05:44,110 --> 01:05:49,090
I'm going to kill 140.
It's like the middle east dude.

1347
01:05:49,150 --> 01:05:51,970
One hundred and 40 degrees and they're 
working outside.

1348
01:05:52,300 --> 01:05:54,880
Packing weeds.
Holy shit.

1349
01:05:54,900 --> 01:05:57,820
That's your life.
Do you think you can get sunblock?

1350
01:05:57,850 --> 01:06:01,900
Can you request that you think in jail 
like that for some people.

1351
01:06:01,910 --> 01:06:04,600
If you were an irish guy with red hair,
I mean I'm really a.

1352
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:06,370
I'll burn.
Excuse me.

1353
01:06:07,050 --> 01:06:08,920
It would catch you talk in spanish 
though,

1354
01:06:08,921 --> 01:06:09,930
and they'd go,
fuck that guy.

1355
01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:15,040
That guy knows how to get tan because 
you speak fluent spanish.

1356
01:06:15,370 --> 01:06:17,680
I've seen people talk shit and spanish 
around.

1357
01:06:17,681 --> 01:06:18,514
tommy.
Tommy will say something in spanish to 

1358
01:06:20,501 --> 01:06:21,460
them and they'll go,
oh,

1359
01:06:21,461 --> 01:06:25,330
the white guy knows track doing a 
spanish talk show on monday.

1360
01:06:26,410 --> 01:06:28,270
I'm doing not just going to let that 
nita on monday.

1361
01:06:28,420 --> 01:06:30,820
See that when he starts doing it in 
spanish,

1362
01:06:30,821 --> 01:06:31,571
spanish like,
oh,

1363
01:06:31,571 --> 01:06:33,040
this is legit spade.
Scary.

1364
01:06:33,041 --> 01:06:33,521
A little,
right.

1365
01:06:33,521 --> 01:06:34,840
It's a little alarming.
You're like,

1366
01:06:34,900 --> 01:06:36,820
it's a host is a clown.
You know?

1367
01:06:37,260 --> 01:06:40,420
It's like a guy in full clown makeup.
Are you going to go on as a rapper?

1368
01:06:40,660 --> 01:06:41,860
I don't know.
I thought about it.

1369
01:06:41,890 --> 01:06:42,723
I thought about it.
I don't know.

1370
01:06:42,740 --> 01:06:43,573
Is the rapper's name again?
Dj dad mouth and if you haven't seen it 

1371
01:06:45,761 --> 01:06:46,870
folks,
dj dad.

1372
01:06:46,871 --> 01:06:50,050
Math is how tom gets to everybody.
Just one thing that everybody hates.

1373
01:06:50,320 --> 01:06:51,640
Everybody hated them.
Not everybody,

1374
01:06:51,641 --> 01:06:54,760
but most comics do not like doing 
morning tv shows.

1375
01:06:54,940 --> 01:06:57,760
They're.
They're probably the most watered down.

1376
01:06:57,940 --> 01:07:00,760
It's like pretending that a glass that's
one quarter,

1377
01:07:00,761 --> 01:07:03,790
low fat milk and three quarters water 
that tastes good.

1378
01:07:04,300 --> 01:07:09,010
That's a good way to drink it.
It's not going to give you any pain,

1379
01:07:09,011 --> 01:07:10,600
but it's not good.
You're not enjoying it.

1380
01:07:10,601 --> 01:07:11,620
It's the worst.
I don't know.

1381
01:07:11,621 --> 01:07:15,640
It's a hard gig to have.
That'll be monday.

1382
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:18,080
What does that mean?
Tom?

1383
01:07:18,081 --> 01:07:21,110
One book that neato nights with the 
plantation,

1384
01:07:21,910 --> 01:07:22,743
his name,
but they need those like little banana 

1385
01:07:24,460 --> 01:07:28,570
nights with little banana man.
I want you to go on sabado domingo,

1386
01:07:28,630 --> 01:07:30,620
that shell,
you know,

1387
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:35,640
so he got this saturday for like 30 
years or something.

1388
01:07:42,080 --> 01:07:46,000
Shell the latin show and we were in 
Florida once in miami in a hotel room.

1389
01:07:46,001 --> 01:07:49,160
He was sick and we were watching just 
hours of it because it'll,

1390
01:07:49,290 --> 01:07:51,860
I think it ended.
I think that guy,

1391
01:07:52,570 --> 01:07:57,570
that guy,
that guy's been comedy sketches,

1392
01:07:58,360 --> 01:08:02,780
they have paternity testing.
TheY have just every slots.

1393
01:08:04,380 --> 01:08:07,100
You just slept chain.
How dare you?

1394
01:08:07,560 --> 01:08:08,393
Slut shame.
Isn't that funny that that's a real 

1395
01:08:12,761 --> 01:08:16,220
expression.
Shaming and slut shaming

1396
01:08:16,230 --> 01:08:19,850
now.
Saigon site and pronoun shaming.

1397
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:23,550
What's your pronoun?
Joe referred to c,

1398
01:08:24,660 --> 01:08:29,660
c h n t dot.dot.
That's my pronoun or gender,

1399
01:08:30,850 --> 01:08:32,000
his majesty thing.
Right.

1400
01:08:32,030 --> 01:08:34,460
You saw that,
saw you haven't seen this?

1401
01:08:34,670 --> 01:08:37,610
Yes.
So university of Michigan,

1402
01:08:37,700 --> 01:08:40,700
like a lot of universities now doing 
this,

1403
01:08:40,790 --> 01:08:41,361
uh,
you know,

1404
01:08:41,361 --> 01:08:45,890
like you sign up for class,
your professor sends out an email to the

1405
01:08:45,891 --> 01:08:50,891
entire class and professor joe rogan,
my preferred pronouns are he him?

1406
01:08:51,290 --> 01:08:52,123
And then this one kid was able to 
[inaudible] you can voluntarily choose 

1407
01:08:54,861 --> 01:08:56,330
your pronoun.
He was like,

1408
01:08:56,331 --> 01:08:59,930
mine is his majestY of it.
What a good kid.

1409
01:09:00,890 --> 01:09:03,320
His whole thing was to point out the 
absurdity of it.

1410
01:09:03,321 --> 01:09:05,780
But then people are like,
you're a fucking asshole.

1411
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:09,590
Like they're all mad at him now.
[inaudible] name is grant strobel,

1412
01:09:09,650 --> 01:09:10,483
chairman of the young americans 
foundation to use the new policy to 

1413
01:09:12,771 --> 01:09:15,020
update his preferred pronoun to his 
majesty.

1414
01:09:15,470 --> 01:09:17,090
How could they be mad at him?
That is.

1415
01:09:17,190 --> 01:09:18,023
That is no more ridiculous than h I r,
of course there's like 18 different 

1416
01:09:21,801 --> 01:09:26,590
gender pronouns now been identified and 
we also know there's astral gendered.

1417
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:31,120
If you're feeling like you're part of 
the cosmos or you polly polly and by.

1418
01:09:31,250 --> 01:09:34,900
Yeah,
you put it on your pot.

1419
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:35,793
He put it on his podcast or he's a 
twitter page and like it was like by 

1420
01:09:39,681 --> 01:09:42,530
awareness day and then.
And then some,

1421
01:09:42,770 --> 01:09:43,603
some guY,
a real professor was tweeting and he 

1422
01:09:46,851 --> 01:09:47,684
retweeted.
It was something that was so close to 

1423
01:09:50,091 --> 01:09:51,350
parody.
What the fuck did he say?

1424
01:09:51,410 --> 01:09:52,243
He was just like.
It was the wording of it was too absurd 

1425
01:09:55,311 --> 01:09:59,960
to even recall,
but it was like remember when you're the

1426
01:10:00,020 --> 01:10:00,853
teacher today on by awareness day,
your gender and your to be by is not to 

1427
01:10:07,101 --> 01:10:07,934
be gender specific,
but specific to city of your gender can 

1428
01:10:12,501 --> 01:10:15,530
also dictate what your sexuality might 
be like.

1429
01:10:15,560 --> 01:10:16,930
What?
Like something like that.

1430
01:10:16,970 --> 01:10:19,910
Something I don't know.
Using.

1431
01:10:20,070 --> 01:10:21,920
Yeah.
And then it was like happy by awareness.

1432
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:25,850
You know?
I finally used an all gender restroom in

1433
01:10:25,851 --> 01:10:29,410
portland and it was at a gay bar and I 
got like,

1434
01:10:29,411 --> 01:10:32,660
I didn't enjoy it and it's not because 
of the whole pronoun thing.

1435
01:10:32,840 --> 01:10:33,673
It's because you've got like dudes 
taking gnarly shits next to you don't 

1436
01:10:37,791 --> 01:10:38,640
need it.
Yeah.

1437
01:10:39,090 --> 01:10:39,923
I don't need,
it dims thursdays I'm poly and by and 

1438
01:10:44,401 --> 01:10:45,234
I'm also fluid gender.
My favorite thing is to be fluid gender 

1439
01:10:48,140 --> 01:10:52,460
because you can go however you're 
feeling in the moment,

1440
01:10:52,610 --> 01:10:53,443
but you have to.
People have to know what to call you so 

1441
01:10:55,491 --> 01:10:56,890
you have to.
That's my favorite.

1442
01:10:56,990 --> 01:10:58,810
Announced constantly.
I,

1443
01:10:58,940 --> 01:10:59,773
we went,
we saw this video of this guy who was 

1444
01:11:00,981 --> 01:11:02,210
like,
he was like,

1445
01:11:02,211 --> 01:11:03,044
you know,
you should really respect people's 

1446
01:11:03,531 --> 01:11:04,520
pronouns,
which,

1447
01:11:04,521 --> 01:11:05,720
which I am like,
okay.

1448
01:11:06,110 --> 01:11:06,943
then he goes,
and if you see somebody and you're not 

1449
01:11:08,271 --> 01:11:09,770
sure,
just ask them.

1450
01:11:09,860 --> 01:11:10,610
Be liKe,
hey,

1451
01:11:10,610 --> 01:11:12,350
what's your pronoun?
To which I say,

1452
01:11:12,590 --> 01:11:13,500
no,
you fucking don't.

1453
01:11:13,620 --> 01:11:14,310
Like,

1454
01:11:14,310 --> 01:11:15,810
you're not going to just see somebody 
and be like,

1455
01:11:15,930 --> 01:11:18,780
hey,
I'm just wondering just a pronoun.

1456
01:11:19,300 --> 01:11:22,290
I think the onus should be on the person
crowder.

1457
01:11:22,350 --> 01:11:23,183
Steven crowder has a fucking hilarious 
video where he actually does this and 

1458
01:11:26,830 --> 01:11:27,230
go,
yeah.

1459
01:11:27,230 --> 01:11:28,063
He goes out and asks people what their 
preferred gender pronouns are and they 

1460
01:11:31,860 --> 01:11:35,340
just the looks they give him like he 
goes to like grown adults,

1461
01:11:35,820 --> 01:11:36,653
goes up to them on the street and just 
talks to them and just wonders what 

1462
01:11:38,311 --> 01:11:39,144
their preferred gender pronoun is.
Nobody knows what the fuck you're 

1463
01:11:40,951 --> 01:11:42,620
talking about.
Preposterous.

1464
01:11:42,660 --> 01:11:46,100
I can't wait foR the backlash.
What's that video?

1465
01:11:46,120 --> 01:11:48,120
That guy dustin.
Dakota.

1466
01:11:48,300 --> 01:11:49,550
Dakota.
Yeah.

1467
01:11:50,240 --> 01:11:52,710
We have to show that one to code is 
amazing.

1468
01:11:52,711 --> 01:11:54,870
Did you see the thing?
Yeah,

1469
01:11:55,290 --> 01:11:57,500
to code Is incredible.
this is zoom,

1470
01:11:57,510 --> 01:11:58,460
zoom,
zoom,

1471
01:11:58,470 --> 01:11:59,200
zoom,
zoom,

1472
01:11:59,200 --> 01:12:00,650
zoom.
Oh,

1473
01:12:00,660 --> 01:12:03,630
for the different gender pronouns.
Why is it so hard?

1474
01:12:03,770 --> 01:12:05,380
Why can't you just do what they asked 
for?

1475
01:12:05,640 --> 01:12:09,130
My pronouns are not preferred thing is 
like,

1476
01:12:09,240 --> 01:12:11,820
I feel like there's enough people going,
okay,

1477
01:12:12,330 --> 01:12:13,163
really that it's kind of a legitimate 
thing to not be 100 percent on board 

1478
01:12:16,531 --> 01:12:17,364
with us,
you know,

1479
01:12:17,670 --> 01:12:18,800
because I feel a little like,
oh,

1480
01:12:18,801 --> 01:12:22,230
am I on the wrong end of history?
Pronouns are not preferred.

1481
01:12:22,520 --> 01:12:25,350
Ask a gender terrorist areas.
Whoa.

1482
01:12:26,260 --> 01:12:27,093
This is the newest video on my ask a 
ginger terrorist playlists on my 

1483
01:12:32,071 --> 01:12:35,090
channel.
Are we allowed to play this without?

1484
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:38,970
You can't.
You can't just play it.

1485
01:12:39,150 --> 01:12:39,983
Well,
we're not showing it on youtube are we 

1486
01:12:41,660 --> 01:12:43,560
haven't like picture in picture.
I'll take it off.

1487
01:12:44,010 --> 01:12:48,580
Take it off.
I know it's this dude's dude.

1488
01:12:49,080 --> 01:12:51,910
Whatever it is that's got a beard.
Not.

1489
01:12:51,911 --> 01:12:54,390
I know it doesn't have a preferred 
gender pronoun.

1490
01:12:54,540 --> 01:12:56,250
Well that's what you're work at.
We're going to get to.

1491
01:12:56,970 --> 01:12:58,290
So that's the thing now,
right?

1492
01:12:58,291 --> 01:12:59,790
You can kind of be whatever you want to 
be.

1493
01:12:59,970 --> 01:13:00,781
Yeah.
Which is fine.

1494
01:13:00,781 --> 01:13:03,540
I guess.
I just think it's funny that some people

1495
01:13:04,050 --> 01:13:09,050
are saying that you should see this 
individual and lead with like,

1496
01:13:12,421 --> 01:13:14,580
it's almost like it's rude for you to 
assume,

1497
01:13:15,150 --> 01:13:17,730
which I think is absurd that you're 
going to do that.

1498
01:13:17,731 --> 01:13:18,564
It's rude to assume like if you,
if you're going to dictate a different 

1499
01:13:21,121 --> 01:13:21,954
pronoun,
I think that should be on you like a 

1500
01:13:24,301 --> 01:13:27,480
status.
Like you should just show people or some

1501
01:13:27,481 --> 01:13:28,314
people do have these little stickers 
that they put on my preferred gender 

1502
01:13:30,841 --> 01:13:32,760
pronoun is.
That's cool.

1503
01:13:32,820 --> 01:13:35,610
Well,
here's a radio lab and this is one of my

1504
01:13:35,611 --> 01:13:37,530
all time favorite ones.
There's a radio,

1505
01:13:37,531 --> 01:13:38,364
a podcast.
They take it so seriously because it's 

1506
01:13:39,871 --> 01:13:43,800
radio lab and uh,
there's a guy on it who's clearly out of

1507
01:13:43,801 --> 01:13:44,634
his fucking mind and he goes back and 
forth between male and female during 

1508
01:13:50,970 --> 01:13:53,340
switches while he's talking to you.
Because I just switched.

1509
01:13:53,341 --> 01:13:55,800
I just switched from the man.
Now you're like,

1510
01:13:55,801 --> 01:13:56,460
well,
okay.

1511
01:13:56,460 --> 01:14:01,460
When do you get to be a dragon?
Do you get to read minds in the future?

1512
01:14:01,890 --> 01:14:04,620
Then we're supposed to respect this.
You have to because it's,

1513
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:09,180
it has to do with gender.
So if this guy was telling you about his

1514
01:14:09,181 --> 01:14:10,650
past lives,
you know,

1515
01:14:10,651 --> 01:14:12,040
as a roman gladiator

1516
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:15,670
or if he was telling you about the 
future when the star ships land,

1517
01:14:15,880 --> 01:14:17,440
you would think that he's a crazy 
person.

1518
01:14:17,460 --> 01:14:18,270
Right?
Right.

1519
01:14:18,270 --> 01:14:21,250
But right now.
But when you talk about gender,

1520
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:23,320
as soon as you start talking about 
gender,

1521
01:14:23,700 --> 01:14:24,533
you really,
you're supposed to like give people the 

1522
01:14:27,071 --> 01:14:27,904
benefit of all doubt.
Like even if you think you're switching 

1523
01:14:30,041 --> 01:14:33,560
gender back and forth as you're talking,
like the idea that you're,

1524
01:14:33,590 --> 01:14:35,620
your genders,
like some sort of a seesaw,

1525
01:14:35,650 --> 01:14:39,190
you're on the precipice and you can just
go left or right to left or right.

1526
01:14:39,191 --> 01:14:43,840
And it is close minded asshole.
You just decide you don't understand.

1527
01:14:44,260 --> 01:14:47,740
But here's the thing,
are we different a lot of the time?

1528
01:14:48,160 --> 01:14:48,993
Why can't I be that difference be 
expressed in gender like you the other 

1529
01:14:51,611 --> 01:14:53,230
day when you were cranky because you 
didn't get your sugar.

1530
01:14:53,290 --> 01:14:54,370
Yeah,
right?

1531
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:55,690
Yeah.
Like what?

1532
01:14:55,780 --> 01:14:59,890
That's be.
You have a dIfferent personality trait.

1533
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:00,753
You fell into this bitchy but doesn't 
like that feeling like going back to 

1534
01:15:06,930 --> 01:15:10,690
like sexist and fire.
Join up gender folk phobic.

1535
01:15:10,691 --> 01:15:13,300
Nervous,
well I'm looking forward,

1536
01:15:13,480 --> 01:15:14,313
I'm looking forward to ignoring so many 
emails that are going to come into my 

1537
01:15:16,930 --> 01:15:20,740
inbox about this conversation,
but people get mad.

1538
01:15:20,860 --> 01:15:22,270
Oh,
I know they're going to get so mad.

1539
01:15:22,300 --> 01:15:24,550
My point is like,
we've talked about this,

1540
01:15:24,940 --> 01:15:29,050
like if you're feeling particularly 
lovie dovie,

1541
01:15:29,210 --> 01:15:31,430
right?
Your patent kittens and you're.

1542
01:15:31,620 --> 01:15:34,180
You're putting your daughter's hair and 
ponytails.

1543
01:15:34,890 --> 01:15:35,723
You're more feminine feeling.
So did you switch genders at that 

1544
01:15:38,861 --> 01:15:39,700
moment?
No.

1545
01:15:39,710 --> 01:15:44,710
You still specifically this guy wanted 
to go back and forth to being recognized

1546
01:15:44,921 --> 01:15:47,400
as a man and then recommend the middle 
of the conversation.

1547
01:15:47,450 --> 01:15:50,320
Then as he goes back and forth,
he becomes a totally different person.

1548
01:15:50,910 --> 01:15:51,743
Like yes,
like he's not going to tolerate any 

1549
01:15:53,171 --> 01:15:54,940
bullshit.
I think usually in the military too,

1550
01:15:54,941 --> 01:15:55,774
it was like it was like there's a lot of
weirdness to the story and he's under 

1551
01:15:58,301 --> 01:15:59,980
the care of a psychiatrist though,
right?

1552
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:00,280
No,
no,

1553
01:16:00,280 --> 01:16:00,660
no,
no.

1554
01:16:00,660 --> 01:16:03,280
He's wondering around getting government
grants and.

1555
01:16:03,370 --> 01:16:05,170
Great.
I have no idea.

1556
01:16:05,260 --> 01:16:08,380
I have no idea what he's doing,
but I just.

1557
01:16:09,220 --> 01:16:10,053
You never go.
Like if someone goes back and forth and 

1558
01:16:13,781 --> 01:16:17,170
pretends to be hungarian,
I'm hungarian now.

1559
01:16:17,360 --> 01:16:17,790
No,
no.

1560
01:16:17,790 --> 01:16:18,623
Now I'm from Ireland,
but I feel today I'm now I'm hungarian 

1561
01:16:20,981 --> 01:16:21,190
again.

1562
01:16:21,190 --> 01:16:22,670
Wait,
I'm identifying that way,

1563
01:16:22,680 --> 01:16:24,370
but that's fine.
Like here's the thing.

1564
01:16:24,371 --> 01:16:26,650
If you want to identify throughout the 
day,

1565
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:30,610
sometimes I am more masculine.
When I'm at the comedy store performing,

1566
01:16:30,611 --> 01:16:33,970
I am very alpha male.
I'm very macho,

1567
01:16:34,090 --> 01:16:34,923
but I do.
I have to demand that people know what 

1568
01:16:37,031 --> 01:16:40,840
to call me at every given moment.
That's a little unrealistic.

1569
01:16:40,870 --> 01:16:43,110
What's a nEw thing?
It's really weird.

1570
01:16:43,270 --> 01:16:44,103
I mean it's so presumptuous and 
narcissistic that you should know what 

1571
01:16:47,321 --> 01:16:48,154
to call it.

1572
01:16:48,620 --> 01:16:53,620
You at least say like right now,
address me as her shoe.

1573
01:16:53,850 --> 01:16:54,683
Different names.
He looks and he just snatched it out of 

1574
01:16:56,590 --> 01:16:57,740
them.
Depending on who I'm.

1575
01:16:57,790 --> 01:17:01,520
I might be mis-gendering or not,
depending on how he here or she hears it

1576
01:17:01,540 --> 01:17:03,930
at the moment.
When you did point,

1577
01:17:04,020 --> 01:17:06,570
if you're in a conversation with that 
person,

1578
01:17:07,880 --> 01:17:10,180
would you like feel like that's a 
respect?

1579
01:17:10,200 --> 01:17:11,630
Like something that you'd be like,
oh,

1580
01:17:11,631 --> 01:17:13,970
okay,
I'll respect your wishes.

1581
01:17:15,440 --> 01:17:18,590
I'm not changing your gender.
You gotta to pick one?

1582
01:17:18,790 --> 01:17:20,180
Yeah.
If you say,

1583
01:17:20,181 --> 01:17:22,070
girl,
you're a girl.

1584
01:17:22,100 --> 01:17:24,170
I'm cool with that.
I don't have any problem with that,

1585
01:17:24,200 --> 01:17:26,040
but you can't go back and forth.
Yeah,

1586
01:17:26,380 --> 01:17:28,760
or I can't talk to you.
It's too much work.

1587
01:17:30,220 --> 01:17:33,410
That's the whole thing.
It's too much fucking work.

1588
01:17:33,411 --> 01:17:35,240
And if you're an adult that's got a full
life,

1589
01:17:35,300 --> 01:17:40,300
how the fuck a room In your head for 
[inaudible] every second changing.

1590
01:17:41,010 --> 01:17:42,890
Not only that,
that's somebody else's issue,

1591
01:17:42,891 --> 01:17:44,300
right?
What about yourself?

1592
01:17:44,950 --> 01:17:46,160
You know,
I don't have any.

1593
01:17:46,220 --> 01:17:47,053
I don't have a room to communicate with 
you because you're concentrating on 

1594
01:17:50,031 --> 01:17:50,864
yourself so much.
You want people to change how they 

1595
01:17:52,701 --> 01:17:53,534
address you.
Can you just change how you feel 

1596
01:17:55,851 --> 01:18:00,080
occasionally and not have a new fucking 
name that someones 3:00

1597
01:18:00,081 --> 01:18:00,914
in the afternoon.

1598
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:04,910
I'm bob,
why did we have to label it every moment

1599
01:18:05,150 --> 01:18:06,460
of every.
Well,

1600
01:18:06,461 --> 01:18:07,294
is he super self indulgent thing and 
that's what you're getting out of this 

1601
01:18:10,311 --> 01:18:11,810
and that's what like the people that 
are,

1602
01:18:11,840 --> 01:18:14,330
you know,
they're being labeled as insensitive.

1603
01:18:14,331 --> 01:18:16,340
Like that's kind of the point.
The point is like,

1604
01:18:16,341 --> 01:18:17,174
yeah,
you're supposed to be insensitive of 

1605
01:18:18,021 --> 01:18:21,110
nonsense.
This deserves a fair amount of mockery,

1606
01:18:23,140 --> 01:18:23,973
afraid to,
in part because we're going to get 

1607
01:18:25,431 --> 01:18:26,264
shamed on twitter.
People are going to call us phobic of 

1608
01:18:28,071 --> 01:18:30,590
this and that.
Even if you say something remotely,

1609
01:18:30,770 --> 01:18:33,080
your gender unpolitically correct or 
whatever.

1610
01:18:33,120 --> 01:18:33,891
Yeah,
look,

1611
01:18:33,891 --> 01:18:38,000
there's a bunch of people out there that
are just not happy and they might not be

1612
01:18:38,001 --> 01:18:38,834
happy with the gender.
They might not be happy with the way 

1613
01:18:40,431 --> 01:18:41,264
they look.
They might not be happy with how old 

1614
01:18:42,501 --> 01:18:43,334
they are.
They might not be happy with a bunch of 

1615
01:18:44,181 --> 01:18:45,014
different things,
but we have like rules as far as like 

1616
01:18:49,220 --> 01:18:53,570
what you can change and what you can't 
change and we're allowing people now.

1617
01:18:53,660 --> 01:18:57,080
This is like a really reason thing to 
just decide to change your gender,

1618
01:18:57,470 --> 01:19:01,250
which doesn't affect me.
I want people to have freedom.

1619
01:19:01,660 --> 01:19:04,250
Doesn't bother me,
but what,

1620
01:19:04,670 --> 01:19:05,650
what is this?
Uh,

1621
01:19:05,960 --> 01:19:08,360
there's an addendum to the radio lab 
story.

1622
01:19:08,370 --> 01:19:12,950
She made them edit out the references to
her actually changing her identity.

1623
01:19:12,951 --> 01:19:13,784
I guess she stopped.
She stopped switching after all this is 

1624
01:19:18,020 --> 01:19:19,670
right here.
And she no longer flips.

1625
01:19:21,040 --> 01:19:21,873
Interesting woman.
She now remains comfortable as a queer 

1626
01:19:25,551 --> 01:19:26,900
trans woman.
What does,

1627
01:19:27,110 --> 01:19:30,110
what does that mean?
What's a queer?

1628
01:19:30,111 --> 01:19:32,300
There's not gay though.
No,

1629
01:19:32,330 --> 01:19:35,120
I thought it meant that queer is like 
weird.

1630
01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:37,310
Like you can do both,
right?

1631
01:19:37,370 --> 01:19:38,690
Isn't it?
what is queer?

1632
01:19:39,210 --> 01:19:43,130
And then let.
How do you know gay is gay?

1633
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:47,150
Queer is not gay.
Queer is like non defined.

1634
01:19:47,210 --> 01:19:51,890
Okay.
So not a non defined trail on binary.

1635
01:19:55,090 --> 01:19:56,270
tom's domain.
Tom,

1636
01:19:56,271 --> 01:19:57,730
can you explain this?
Yeah,

1637
01:19:58,010 --> 01:20:02,720
I mean basically.
Well you guys,

1638
01:20:02,721 --> 01:20:06,370
you fall on the binary spectrum.
Cisgender and privileged.

1639
01:20:07,410 --> 01:20:08,243
Okay.
Here we go.

1640
01:20:08,310 --> 01:20:09,570
Shoot a queer feeling.
Nope.

1641
01:20:09,571 --> 01:20:11,310
That's not it.
A homosexual.

1642
01:20:11,370 --> 01:20:12,510
No.
No.

1643
01:20:12,511 --> 01:20:16,770
See they're using a different.
Now see it used to be homosexual,

1644
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:19,350
but it's not just a homosexual anymore.
Okay.

1645
01:20:19,351 --> 01:20:21,630
TeRms and definitions.
Lbgt right there.

1646
01:20:21,631 --> 01:20:23,610
Click on that one.
Lgbtq now.

1647
01:20:23,670 --> 01:20:27,090
Oh no,
there's an I in an a in there to look at

1648
01:20:27,091 --> 01:20:27,600
that.
See,

1649
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:30,650
look at that.
Make that largest fucking shitty.

1650
01:20:30,710 --> 01:20:32,010
I ask you to read it.
Bisexual,

1651
01:20:32,011 --> 01:20:33,050
transgender,
queer.

1652
01:20:33,530 --> 01:20:34,020
Yeah.
Look at it.

1653
01:20:34,020 --> 01:20:35,190
But look it above.
Above.

1654
01:20:35,220 --> 01:20:36,720
Go up to the top.
Look,

1655
01:20:36,850 --> 01:20:41,300
lg lgbtqa.
What is tb,

1656
01:20:41,360 --> 01:20:43,770
lg queer,
asexual,

1657
01:20:43,771 --> 01:20:45,200
queer,
or a sexual history.

1658
01:20:45,230 --> 01:20:49,950
Questions or questioning and a sexual,
but there's intersexual to.

1659
01:20:49,951 --> 01:20:51,840
There's I.
Some people choose.

1660
01:20:51,841 --> 01:20:53,410
I wait.
What site?

1661
01:20:53,460 --> 01:20:54,390
WHat does that mean?
No,

1662
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:56,330
let's get to q,
queer,

1663
01:20:56,860 --> 01:20:58,710
intersex,
intersex as jamie,

1664
01:20:59,070 --> 01:21:01,770
an umbrella term used by l,
g,

1665
01:21:01,771 --> 01:21:02,604
b t q,
a people to revert to the entire lgbt 

1666
01:21:07,021 --> 01:21:09,930
community and alternative that some 
people used to.

1667
01:21:09,930 --> 01:21:12,510
Queer is the idea that labels and 
categories such as lesbian,

1668
01:21:12,511 --> 01:21:13,350
gay,
bisexual,

1669
01:21:13,351 --> 01:21:15,900
etc.
Similar to the concept of queer,

1670
01:21:15,950 --> 01:21:17,660
of gender queer.
Oh,

1671
01:21:17,700 --> 01:21:18,960
okay.
Gender queer is different.

1672
01:21:20,010 --> 01:21:21,870
what's gender queer?
I think that'd be like me,

1673
01:21:21,871 --> 01:21:26,190
like nonbinary where I don't fall under 
the spectrum of male or female.

1674
01:21:26,220 --> 01:21:27,053
gender.
Queer is a term which refers to 

1675
01:21:28,381 --> 01:21:29,214
individuals or groups who are queer or 
problematize what for making a fake 

1676
01:21:33,931 --> 01:21:36,900
words,
hegemonic notions of sex,

1677
01:21:36,901 --> 01:21:37,950
gender,
and desire.

1678
01:21:37,951 --> 01:21:38,784
In a given society,
gender queer people possess identities 

1679
01:21:40,921 --> 01:21:45,900
which fall outside of the widely 
accepted sexual binary.

1680
01:21:45,930 --> 01:21:47,700
You're not buying your area,
your gender queer,

1681
01:21:47,730 --> 01:21:49,140
row,
gender queer.

1682
01:21:49,170 --> 01:21:54,170
Gender may also refer to people who 
identify as both transgendered and queer

1683
01:21:56,230 --> 01:21:57,430
eye individuals who

1684
01:21:57,860 --> 01:21:59,010
this a lot of work.
Man,

1685
01:21:59,130 --> 01:21:59,963
that's a lot of work time.
This is what you do when you don't chop 

1686
01:22:02,310 --> 01:22:03,440
firewood.
Yeah,

1687
01:22:05,700 --> 01:22:09,570
fucking easy to get water.
To get bottled water,

1688
01:22:09,860 --> 01:22:12,780
easy society.
We have to invent all these things.

1689
01:22:12,781 --> 01:22:14,850
Now what happened?
I just be in Here.

1690
01:22:15,540 --> 01:22:17,710
Why is everybody has to be defined?
I don't know.

1691
01:22:17,730 --> 01:22:18,563
Why do we have to check each other to 
make sure that everyone's on the same 

1692
01:22:20,281 --> 01:22:21,114
fucking agenda?
Do you know how much I'm dreading my 

1693
01:22:22,771 --> 01:22:23,910
son,
our son?

1694
01:22:23,911 --> 01:22:26,100
Sorry.
Going to school.

1695
01:22:26,190 --> 01:22:29,520
Do you know that there are schools that 
don't have grades first grade,

1696
01:22:29,521 --> 01:22:30,720
second grade,
third grade,

1697
01:22:30,721 --> 01:22:34,170
so that the kids don't feel bad.
There was no hierarchy.

1698
01:22:34,530 --> 01:22:36,150
Group one,
group two,

1699
01:22:36,180 --> 01:22:37,800
group three,
shit like that.

1700
01:22:37,801 --> 01:22:40,260
Soft.
People are trying to eliminate all forms

1701
01:22:40,261 --> 01:22:42,480
of competition and scrutiny and they're 
calling.

1702
01:22:42,481 --> 01:22:44,400
Any criticism of you at all?
Bullying,

1703
01:22:45,210 --> 01:22:46,810
bullying.
It's all bull.

1704
01:22:47,310 --> 01:22:47,850
Yeah.
There's.

1705
01:22:47,850 --> 01:22:51,120
There's a lot of leagues with no.
No score.

1706
01:22:51,960 --> 01:22:53,460
It's crazy.
It's weird.

1707
01:22:53,640 --> 01:22:55,290
That is really weird.
It's weird.

1708
01:22:55,920 --> 01:22:57,810
I think loss has really helped you as a 
kid.

1709
01:22:57,840 --> 01:23:00,210
I think shame helps you.
Loss,

1710
01:23:00,211 --> 01:23:01,770
anxiety,
fear.

1711
01:23:01,860 --> 01:23:06,190
those were all my primary motivations as
a young woman and it carried me very

1712
01:23:06,190 --> 01:23:07,023
far.
I'm not a fucking loser and because of 

1713
01:23:08,621 --> 01:23:11,770
these things,
I'm sure like the people that do it,

1714
01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:13,990
that,
that do mean shit or say mean shit.

1715
01:23:13,991 --> 01:23:15,850
The kids,
they realized after they do it,

1716
01:23:15,851 --> 01:23:18,790
how shitty it feels.
Like it's a learning experience even for

1717
01:23:18,791 --> 01:23:19,624
them,
like they should absolutely be 

1718
01:23:19,931 --> 01:23:20,764
corrected,
but this idea that somehow or another 

1719
01:23:23,411 --> 01:23:26,260
you're going to wipe all that stuff out.
That's part of being a person,

1720
01:23:26,261 --> 01:23:28,000
right?
It's a weird part of being a person.

1721
01:23:28,001 --> 01:23:31,210
Like people liked the fact that they can
affect people by saying shit.

1722
01:23:31,420 --> 01:23:32,890
You know,
they absolutely.

1723
01:23:33,440 --> 01:23:34,273
Yeah.
The idea that we're going to sanitize 

1724
01:23:35,411 --> 01:23:36,244
out everything so that your kids will 
never have to feel a bad feeling ever 

1725
01:23:38,831 --> 01:23:39,850
again.
No one.

1726
01:23:39,900 --> 01:23:41,160
Everything's going to be perfect,
right?

1727
01:23:41,180 --> 01:23:44,020
To make a whole new bathroom,
to make a whole,

1728
01:23:44,030 --> 01:23:44,863
uh,
an asexual bathroom because some people 

1729
01:23:46,391 --> 01:23:47,680
just,
they're not sure.

1730
01:23:48,330 --> 01:23:49,163
Some people,
people are just gonna start shooting 

1731
01:23:50,080 --> 01:23:50,913
outside.

1732
01:23:53,210 --> 01:23:55,180
I can't wait for the,
what is this one?

1733
01:23:55,250 --> 01:23:58,150
Half a skirt is this new form someone 
just posted.

1734
01:23:58,180 --> 01:23:59,013
Oh my god.
Is that new?

1735
01:23:59,230 --> 01:24:00,850
Is that real?
That's a college.

1736
01:24:00,940 --> 01:24:04,480
That's where your tax dollars are going.
It's a high school somewhere.

1737
01:24:05,110 --> 01:24:07,320
Come on man.
How many people this,

1738
01:24:07,780 --> 01:24:10,450
how big of an issue is this?
You know,

1739
01:24:10,451 --> 01:24:13,360
because there's people that have all 
sorts of very strange,

1740
01:24:13,390 --> 01:24:14,980
uh,
identity disorders.

1741
01:24:16,030 --> 01:24:16,863
There's a guy in england that thinks 
he's a six year old girl and he 

1742
01:24:19,211 --> 01:24:22,530
identifies a six year old girl and he 
wears pigtails the whole deal.

1743
01:24:23,050 --> 01:24:25,360
He sits down with his kids and his own 
parents,

1744
01:24:25,361 --> 01:24:26,680
kids.
He kids.

1745
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:27,833
Wow.
He identifies as being a six year old 

1746
01:24:29,081 --> 01:24:29,770
girl.
Hey,

1747
01:24:29,770 --> 01:24:32,440
we have to accept this.
As long as you change gender,

1748
01:24:32,450 --> 01:24:34,810
they uh,
his family.

1749
01:24:34,840 --> 01:24:36,610
As long as you change the gender,
everybody's cool with it.

1750
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:41,650
Meet the 52 yeAr old father that if he 
thought he was 13,

1751
01:24:41,651 --> 01:24:44,720
he tried fucking 13 year olds.
13 to know.

1752
01:24:45,380 --> 01:24:46,710
Maybe everybody goes,
no,

1753
01:24:46,720 --> 01:24:47,740
you're out of your mind.
Dude.

1754
01:24:47,830 --> 01:24:49,900
she is gorgeous.
Look at this.

1755
01:24:50,050 --> 01:24:55,050
He's living as a six year old girl,
abandoned his wife and kid,

1756
01:24:56,580 --> 01:25:00,060
but let's be for seven kids.
He has seven munchies.

1757
01:25:00,120 --> 01:25:03,190
She has seven kids.
Do you want her to be a daddy?

1758
01:25:03,550 --> 01:25:04,420
Well,
it's too late.

1759
01:25:05,860 --> 01:25:06,693
Already a daddy better those kids.
But the kids are better off without her 

1760
01:25:09,220 --> 01:25:11,500
shoes.
So he was living as an adult.

1761
01:25:11,580 --> 01:25:12,800
He has a,
you know,

1762
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:13,713
a family,
the whole deal and then just decides 

1763
01:25:16,690 --> 01:25:17,523
that he's not just a woman,
but he's a small young six year old 

1764
01:25:22,040 --> 01:25:24,090
girl.
There's something else called again,

1765
01:25:24,490 --> 01:25:28,410
psychiatrists need to get involved in 
the volume on this young jamie

1766
01:25:29,750 --> 01:25:32,160
and as well the tv show.
Boy,

1767
01:25:32,820 --> 01:25:35,950
am I a boy or a girl decide to go public
with your short.

1768
01:25:36,870 --> 01:25:37,703
Um,
I paid a pretty heavy price for 

1769
01:25:39,861 --> 01:25:40,694
transitioning.
And so at a certain point I've already 

1770
01:25:45,471 --> 01:25:47,150
lost everything and everything has 
happened.

1771
01:25:47,810 --> 01:25:51,410
I'm going to be me and I'm going to show
other people that it's okay to be.

1772
01:25:51,680 --> 01:25:52,513
She looks like most middle aged women,
Wisconsin coming out of the closet just 

1773
01:25:57,380 --> 01:26:01,730
liberated like my friends' moms when I 
was a kid in milwaukee.

1774
01:26:01,760 --> 01:26:03,530
They all look like that.
Transgendered,

1775
01:26:03,630 --> 01:26:04,463
six-year-olds,

1776
01:26:06,170 --> 01:26:11,170
I'm torn about because I don't give a 
shit if he wants to be a woman,

1777
01:26:13,670 --> 01:26:17,660
but I just can't see this.
There's a line that's being pushed by.

1778
01:26:17,661 --> 01:26:18,494
These fucks keep going further further 
and they keep taking advantage of your 

1779
01:26:23,751 --> 01:26:26,480
acceptance and they want nonsense to get
through.

1780
01:26:26,670 --> 01:26:28,680
This is fucking nonsense.
Nonsense.

1781
01:26:28,690 --> 01:26:31,130
This is a person who just wants 
nonsense.

1782
01:26:31,160 --> 01:26:31,993
The world didn't work out for them.
The regular world of having a short 

1783
01:26:34,791 --> 01:26:37,100
haircut and wearing t shirts,
he's like,

1784
01:26:37,101 --> 01:26:37,934
no,
I'm going to wear a little girl's 

1785
01:26:38,271 --> 01:26:39,890
dresses.
I'm going to be a six year old.

1786
01:26:40,100 --> 01:26:41,140
Hey,
how about you?

1787
01:26:41,330 --> 01:26:44,240
HOw about fuck you man?
Well enough.

1788
01:26:44,270 --> 01:26:47,600
Now here's the thing.
Twenty years ago,

1789
01:26:47,660 --> 01:26:51,040
maybe even less the answer to like six 
years and be like,

1790
01:26:51,110 --> 01:26:52,070
hey,
go fuck yourself.

1791
01:26:52,071 --> 01:26:52,904
Because all these shutting sterl online 
and they're ganging up and attacking 

1792
01:26:57,501 --> 01:26:58,830
universities,
right?

1793
01:26:58,940 --> 01:27:01,400
And attacking anybody Who sees anything 
any differently.

1794
01:27:01,400 --> 01:27:02,960
This is not accepted.
It's folks.

1795
01:27:03,190 --> 01:27:04,023
Acceptance is 100 percent fine.
you should be able to do whatever you 

1796
01:27:06,171 --> 01:27:07,004
want,
but you want to pretend that's not 

1797
01:27:09,051 --> 01:27:12,800
crazy.
We got a problem or a 52 year old man.

1798
01:27:12,801 --> 01:27:15,350
You pretend to be a six year old boy.
You're out at your fucking mind.

1799
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:16,433
Well,
guess what?

1800
01:27:16,520 --> 01:27:19,010
If you're a 52 year oLd man,
you want to be a six year old girl,

1801
01:27:19,011 --> 01:27:22,550
you're still out of your fucking mind.
You've been alive for 52 years.

1802
01:27:22,551 --> 01:27:25,430
We're supposed to pretend that your life
experiences is nothing.

1803
01:27:25,460 --> 01:27:27,770
Your records you enjoyed that stage of 
life.

1804
01:27:27,800 --> 01:27:31,010
You're given so much credibility to this
idea.

1805
01:27:31,011 --> 01:27:31,844
I feel like this is because of the 
gender switch because you're in weight 

1806
01:27:36,770 --> 01:27:38,030
loss.
Especially if you're like me.

1807
01:27:38,031 --> 01:27:43,031
If you're a man and a meathead like me,
asshole insensitive asshole.

1808
01:27:44,320 --> 01:27:45,890
This is nonsense.
That's for the record.

1809
01:27:45,890 --> 01:27:46,723
I'm a woman and I think this is complete
horseshit to 100 percent horseshoe and 

1810
01:27:50,691 --> 01:27:51,524
also there's something good about the 
conformity of the 19 fifties and before 

1811
01:27:55,270 --> 01:28:00,270
because I feel like we've got a rug.
Of course.

1812
01:28:01,210 --> 01:28:01,851
No,
I'm telling you,

1813
01:28:01,851 --> 01:28:02,990
that's a.
You know,

1814
01:28:03,050 --> 01:28:06,990
that was a time when you couldn't.
He's got fucking seven kids brawling.

1815
01:28:07,830 --> 01:28:11,990
Don't you think that outweighs your duty
to your family outweighs your need to be

1816
01:28:11,991 --> 01:28:15,020
a six year old?
Gets drawn to.

1817
01:28:15,021 --> 01:28:18,470
I'm drawn to it.
To the people that are really direct,

1818
01:28:18,471 --> 01:28:20,620
like no bullshit.
Like dance,

1819
01:28:21,610 --> 01:28:23,460
like the,
the,

1820
01:28:24,130 --> 01:28:26,390
the business coach.
Oh,

1821
01:28:26,510 --> 01:28:27,890
the $50,000,000,000
man.

1822
01:28:28,330 --> 01:28:30,050
Holy food.
Love this guy.

1823
01:28:31,450 --> 01:28:33,270
I thought you're going to say jody as 
well.

1824
01:28:35,390 --> 01:28:37,400
If you do.
If you look up dan pena.

1825
01:28:37,460 --> 01:28:40,760
this is why you're poor.
And you scroll.

1826
01:28:41,240 --> 01:28:42,520
Scroll to a minute.
40.

1827
01:28:42,530 --> 01:28:43,710
That guy.
Yes.

1828
01:28:43,910 --> 01:28:48,910
He just fucking dirty.
And so it's so funny.

1829
01:28:50,150 --> 01:28:52,940
He doesn't give a shit though.
That's what he's almost dead.

1830
01:28:53,100 --> 01:28:56,480
Well,
donald trump's going to rock the planet.

1831
01:28:56,600 --> 01:28:57,640
He's a trump supporter.
Yeah.

1832
01:28:57,670 --> 01:28:58,670
He's out of his mind.
Yeah,

1833
01:28:58,671 --> 01:29:00,260
I think so.
But friends,

1834
01:29:00,261 --> 01:29:01,430
I think he knows him.

1835
01:29:02,210 --> 01:29:03,930
I don't think we could play stuff 
without getting sued.

1836
01:29:03,931 --> 01:29:06,060
Jamie,
can you hear the audio?

1837
01:29:06,090 --> 01:29:07,020
Yeah,
I don't think so.

1838
01:29:07,170 --> 01:29:08,300
No.
Yeah,

1839
01:29:08,380 --> 01:29:12,570
I highly doubt he'll let you play your 
stuff without you heal yankee offline.

1840
01:29:13,410 --> 01:29:15,090
We put a match.
Yeah.

1841
01:29:15,091 --> 01:29:16,890
They're going to find you think so?
Yeah.

1842
01:29:17,270 --> 01:29:18,500
Matter time.
Shit.

1843
01:29:19,230 --> 01:29:21,570
I don't know.
I just think this is his property,

1844
01:29:22,440 --> 01:29:24,600
like his,
his lectures and all that stuff.

1845
01:29:25,080 --> 01:29:28,000
This is where fair use argument could be
a player.

1846
01:29:28,310 --> 01:29:30,270
That fair use argument is not.
It's.

1847
01:29:30,290 --> 01:29:33,450
It's a weird argument.
We play shit all the time and talk about

1848
01:29:33,451 --> 01:29:34,760
it and it gets jacked.
Whom?

1849
01:29:34,860 --> 01:29:36,240
Well did you see the guy,
the video today?

1850
01:29:36,241 --> 01:29:37,580
The guy who got attacked by a grizzly 
bear?

1851
01:29:38,700 --> 01:29:41,540
Holy shit.
No,

1852
01:29:41,640 --> 01:29:42,473
it wasn't even hunting.
Was scouting scouting for an upcoming 

1853
01:29:45,721 --> 01:29:49,500
client and he came across a mama bear 
and her cubs.

1854
01:29:49,501 --> 01:29:50,520
That's what's up.
Yeah,

1855
01:29:50,521 --> 01:29:55,260
and he even sprayed it with bear spray.
He said dead on 25 yards,

1856
01:29:55,650 --> 01:29:57,500
like unloaded in the bear.
Just ran.

1857
01:29:57,870 --> 01:29:59,250
Ran right through it.

1858
01:30:01,590 --> 01:30:03,420
You don't.
I mean you don't.

1859
01:30:04,140 --> 01:30:05,880
You don't know what they're going to do 
until they do it.

1860
01:30:06,120 --> 01:30:09,360
That bear spray might work sometimes.
It didn't work this time.

1861
01:30:12,740 --> 01:30:13,260
Yeah.
Look,

1862
01:30:13,260 --> 01:30:14,093
it's hard to tell here,
but his skin is hanging off of his head 

1863
01:30:17,130 --> 01:30:21,240
above his ear and he the bear bit 
through his arms to.

1864
01:30:21,360 --> 01:30:22,193
His name's todd or he's lucky he got 
away on my face and protected the back 

1865
01:30:26,561 --> 01:30:27,670
of my neck.
Oh my god,

1866
01:30:28,990 --> 01:30:33,310
I don't know what's under my hat,
my arm,

1867
01:30:33,730 --> 01:30:36,790
his arm's broken.
look at that stuff.

1868
01:30:36,791 --> 01:30:38,950
Hanging out.
This whole just twitched.

1869
01:30:39,040 --> 01:30:44,040
You couldn't imagine a fucking bear 
female grizzly bear protecting her cubs.

1870
01:30:46,730 --> 01:30:47,563
Tough.
This guy is holding back that up there 

1871
01:30:48,360 --> 01:30:50,470
for a second there.
Back it up.

1872
01:30:50,660 --> 01:30:52,540
Look at it.
Listen to this.

1873
01:30:54,430 --> 01:30:57,040
Internal organs are good.
Eyes are good.

1874
01:30:57,880 --> 01:31:00,280
I just walked out three miles.
Now you go to the hospital,

1875
01:31:00,460 --> 01:31:01,293
so nobody stopped to make a video,
but listen to that pragmatic way of 

1876
01:31:06,101 --> 01:31:08,230
looking at her legs are good.

1877
01:31:09,190 --> 01:31:12,190
Internal organs are good.
Like that is the fear.

1878
01:31:12,191 --> 01:31:16,840
Like that guy just came in contact with 
a real live monster,

1879
01:31:17,620 --> 01:31:21,580
a fucking grizzly bear twice,
twice in a day.

1880
01:31:22,570 --> 01:31:23,403
A real live.
After that three mile hike got in his 

1881
01:31:26,741 --> 01:31:30,510
truck and drove 20 miles to a hospital 
for then.

1882
01:31:30,511 --> 01:31:34,750
You should probably so happy.
Just he's alive.

1883
01:31:34,751 --> 01:31:36,070
I mean,
you see the photos,

1884
01:31:36,100 --> 01:31:37,230
the scar.
Yeah.

1885
01:31:37,300 --> 01:31:38,260
oh my god.
Yeah.

1886
01:31:38,261 --> 01:31:40,180
the photos that headscarf.
Yeah.

1887
01:31:40,181 --> 01:31:41,290
That's really,
really big.

1888
01:31:41,330 --> 01:31:43,930
Yeah.
I wonder if that was a claw was probably

1889
01:31:43,931 --> 01:31:45,620
a claw.
Sorry.

1890
01:31:45,900 --> 01:31:47,950
He's so.
He's scouting for alex,

1891
01:31:47,951 --> 01:31:50,380
so this is like a public,
but is it a,

1892
01:31:50,920 --> 01:31:51,900
I don't know where,
where,

1893
01:31:52,060 --> 01:31:54,370
where do people have some kind of a 
hunting area?

1894
01:31:54,371 --> 01:31:57,070
Yeah.
He's said he could be on private land,

1895
01:31:57,071 --> 01:31:59,800
but most likely is on public land.
And um,

1896
01:31:59,850 --> 01:32:01,180
you know,
they have a,

1897
01:32:01,480 --> 01:32:02,313
they don't,
I don't believe Montana has a grizzly 

1898
01:32:03,521 --> 01:32:04,354
bear season.

1899
01:32:04,870 --> 01:32:07,990
They do have grizzly bears,
so he just wasn't.

1900
01:32:07,991 --> 01:32:10,030
He just walked over and then I.
Yeah,

1901
01:32:10,031 --> 01:32:10,864
I think the only place you can hunt 
grizzly bears in north America as 

1902
01:32:12,851 --> 01:32:14,950
Alaska,
I think.

1903
01:32:15,210 --> 01:32:16,043
I think there's grizzly bears in Alaska 
and then I don't think you even hunt 

1904
01:32:19,391 --> 01:32:23,230
grizzly bears in Canada.
He had imagined the diarrhea in Canada.

1905
01:32:23,231 --> 01:32:25,480
They hunt them in british columbia.
What am I talking about?

1906
01:32:26,600 --> 01:32:29,920
Like when you,
when you walk over and then 80 yards was

1907
01:32:29,921 --> 01:32:34,570
a bear and you'd be like,
oh god.

1908
01:32:34,690 --> 01:32:36,650
And then you just,
you got his spread.

1909
01:32:36,880 --> 01:32:39,280
He knows if you're around here,
like you can't book it,

1910
01:32:39,281 --> 01:32:41,800
you're not going to run.
He sprayed it.

1911
01:32:41,860 --> 01:32:45,550
We know that that's one photo of his 
arm,

1912
01:32:45,880 --> 01:32:46,713
but check out the other ones just has 
one of his head or pull them up because 

1913
01:32:49,541 --> 01:32:50,890
I'm not logged into facebook.
Oh,

1914
01:32:50,891 --> 01:32:51,724
okay.

1915
01:32:52,300 --> 01:32:54,520
I'm just see if we could find it outside
of a,

1916
01:32:54,960 --> 01:32:55,793
but oh my god.
So my buddy Adam Green tree who is on 

1917
01:32:59,321 --> 01:33:01,180
the podcast last week,
he's a bow hunter.

1918
01:33:01,181 --> 01:33:02,890
There it is.
Look at his head.

1919
01:33:03,490 --> 01:33:05,740
Look at the giant scar that goes from 
his temple.

1920
01:33:05,790 --> 01:33:07,930
Although first of all,
if you wanted a scar on the back of your

1921
01:33:07,931 --> 01:33:09,010
head,
that's the spot.

1922
01:33:09,440 --> 01:33:12,820
Like it doesn't rip his ear off.
Doesn't you know?

1923
01:33:13,260 --> 01:33:14,093
It's got a nice line on his head,
but it seems like it will stitch back 

1924
01:33:16,211 --> 01:33:19,920
together as long as he doesn't have an 
infection from the bear bite.

1925
01:33:20,540 --> 01:33:23,320
And a guy's goT a good story too for 
awhile now.

1926
01:33:24,380 --> 01:33:28,720
One bite on my farm went through to the 
bone and I heard a crunch.

1927
01:33:32,380 --> 01:33:32,970
Yeah,

1928
01:33:32,970 --> 01:33:34,170
think you're dead,
right?

1929
01:33:34,200 --> 01:33:35,033
You're like,
this is it.

1930
01:33:35,100 --> 01:33:36,900
This guy's really good about social 
media.

1931
01:33:36,901 --> 01:33:37,380
this.
He's like,

1932
01:33:37,380 --> 01:33:40,740
hey everyone.
I got to tell you this video.

1933
01:33:40,741 --> 01:33:42,690
He did a couple of,
well,

1934
01:33:42,691 --> 01:33:43,524
this guy's a hunting guide.
Do you know how like in tune with the 

1935
01:33:46,321 --> 01:33:51,321
wilderness and this kind of sPeed and 
the Montana montana's the woods man.

1936
01:33:53,041 --> 01:33:54,690
Yeah,
I mean it's beautiful,

1937
01:33:54,691 --> 01:33:59,070
but I mean it is a wild state.
They have a lot of grizzly bears here,

1938
01:33:59,080 --> 01:33:59,913
man.
Lot of a lot of like free roaming 

1939
01:34:02,490 --> 01:34:03,520
animals everywhere,
right?

1940
01:34:03,521 --> 01:34:04,354
Because we went there in the summer and 
we went to bozeman and we drove down 

1941
01:34:06,691 --> 01:34:07,524
this road and we pulled up.
We saw 100 elk just sitting in this 

1942
01:34:10,201 --> 01:34:11,910
field like right off the side of the 
road.

1943
01:34:11,911 --> 01:34:13,260
We're like,
this is crazy.

1944
01:34:13,660 --> 01:34:18,440
You just get out of the car and look at 
them on a hunting trip or with my family

1945
01:34:18,450 --> 01:34:18,830
we went to.

1946
01:34:18,830 --> 01:34:19,663
We did the yellowstone thing,
but just looking out and looking at all 

1947
01:34:21,841 --> 01:34:24,060
these animals like whoa.
And apparentlY,

1948
01:34:24,090 --> 01:34:26,670
but we saw grizzlies there but we saw 
them at a grizzly sanctuary,

1949
01:34:27,300 --> 01:34:29,340
but apparently people just run into them
all the time.

1950
01:34:29,520 --> 01:34:30,353
Yeah,
you just,

1951
01:34:30,480 --> 01:34:31,313
you could fuck up like this guy and just
accidentally be in the Wrong place at 

1952
01:34:34,351 --> 01:34:36,870
the wrong time.
And the female has her cubs.

1953
01:34:37,750 --> 01:34:41,450
I remember going there once and having 
the guide tells,

1954
01:34:41,530 --> 01:34:45,180
you know,
if you run into a bear and like do these

1955
01:34:45,181 --> 01:34:46,500
things in the whole time.
Your brains,

1956
01:34:46,501 --> 01:34:48,440
like you just got to die,
you know,

1957
01:34:48,450 --> 01:34:49,960
like he's like,
you know,

1958
01:34:50,010 --> 01:34:51,990
cover your ears and crowds.
But like,

1959
01:34:51,991 --> 01:34:53,370
play limp,
don't fight back,

1960
01:34:53,400 --> 01:34:55,890
don't run my life.
And this guy actually did it,

1961
01:34:55,920 --> 01:34:57,170
which is the crazy part.
Yeah.

1962
01:34:57,171 --> 01:34:59,330
He actually did it and he played dead on
that second one.

1963
01:34:59,330 --> 01:35:00,163
He said,
yeah,

1964
01:35:00,230 --> 01:35:02,870
he just went limp.
It's the only way.

1965
01:35:03,650 --> 01:35:05,540
Imagine going limp on that thing is 
biting you.

1966
01:35:07,090 --> 01:35:09,710
Jesus christ,
they're so big.

1967
01:35:09,790 --> 01:35:10,930
It's such a terrifying.
It's,

1968
01:35:10,980 --> 01:35:11,813
it's crazy that it's a real thing that 
there's a real animal that's 11 feet 

1969
01:35:15,651 --> 01:35:18,470
tall.
It weighs a thousand pounds.

1970
01:35:18,620 --> 01:35:23,270
So my friend adam,
he went on an elk by himself in Montana.

1971
01:35:23,300 --> 01:35:26,360
He was in Montana,
shot an elk and uh,

1972
01:35:26,390 --> 01:35:27,223
he's,
he has to pack it off the mountain and 

1973
01:35:28,461 --> 01:35:29,294
he's like 14 miles in.
So he's got to pack this thousand pound 

1974
01:35:33,171 --> 01:35:37,910
animal and he's going to do it in 150 
200 pound chunks.

1975
01:35:38,030 --> 01:35:40,160
So he's going to and each one of them is
going to take a day.

1976
01:35:40,580 --> 01:35:44,330
So he's doing it essentially four days 
of just packing out meat.

1977
01:35:44,540 --> 01:35:49,460
So the first day when he goes back,
a grizzly was sleeping on the carcass.

1978
01:35:49,550 --> 01:35:50,383
A giant grizzly bear,
11 foot grizzly bears sleeping on the 

1979
01:35:54,201 --> 01:35:54,560
dead.

1980
01:35:54,560 --> 01:35:55,393
Elk chase it off and scare it.
Has to yell at it to try to get it out 

1981
01:35:58,981 --> 01:36:02,500
of there.
He has a pistol with him by himself.

1982
01:36:02,840 --> 01:36:05,030
I don't think I would have taken that 
route by himself.

1983
01:36:05,060 --> 01:36:06,050
He had no,
that's nuts.

1984
01:36:06,080 --> 01:36:07,610
No,
he can have the elk.

1985
01:36:07,611 --> 01:36:09,910
Dude.
The bear ran off really well.

1986
01:36:10,850 --> 01:36:12,740
Is that the approach you would have done
without knowing this?

1987
01:36:12,840 --> 01:36:13,760
Have you been like,
man,

1988
01:36:13,761 --> 01:36:14,890
I don't know.
I mean,

1989
01:36:15,160 --> 01:36:19,310
you post to do that.
You say you're supposed to yell at me if

1990
01:36:19,311 --> 01:36:20,144
you want it to leave,
but you might want to Just give it to 

1991
01:36:21,951 --> 01:36:23,540
meat.
Get the fuck out of there.

1992
01:36:23,610 --> 01:36:25,330
Just get the fuck out of there.
That's not true anymore.

1993
01:36:25,340 --> 01:36:26,330
Did he?
Doesn't.

1994
01:36:26,480 --> 01:36:27,313
He didn't want to do that beCause he.
He worked hard for that elk can you 

1995
01:36:29,200 --> 01:36:30,380
shine,
right?

1996
01:36:30,410 --> 01:36:31,870
It's a tough fucking call.

1997
01:36:32,330 --> 01:36:33,740
I wouldn't want to be the one to make 
it.

1998
01:36:33,770 --> 01:36:35,090
No,
of course not.

1999
01:36:35,240 --> 01:36:36,710
No.
See goes one hand.

2000
01:36:36,711 --> 01:36:37,700
You would say,
well look,

2001
01:36:37,820 --> 01:36:38,653
the bad news is I don't get to meet.
The good news is the of big and see 

2002
01:36:40,410 --> 01:36:42,800
because I really liked paris.
I had a teddy bear when I was a kid.

2003
01:36:43,250 --> 01:36:46,670
That's my friend cameron hanes.
That's one he killed in Alaska.

2004
01:36:47,180 --> 01:36:48,013
Is he the guy that also does those crazy
marathon run ran 200 miles this summer 

2005
01:36:52,640 --> 01:36:54,470
in a day.
Seventy eight hours.

2006
01:36:54,580 --> 01:36:57,230
He ran three days,
slept three hOurs and three days.

2007
01:36:57,260 --> 01:36:58,093
How do you,
how does your system keep going until 

2008
01:36:59,890 --> 01:37:03,110
you have to build up to it?
He was runninG a half a marathon a day.

2009
01:37:03,260 --> 01:37:05,540
Every day was running 13 miles.
That's insane.

2010
01:37:05,541 --> 01:37:06,374
And then he ran a hundred miles in like 
june to prepare for the 205 miles in 

2011
01:37:13,610 --> 01:37:14,720
august.
Wow.

2012
01:37:14,930 --> 01:37:17,420
It's insane.
I mean there's the mental part,

2013
01:37:17,450 --> 01:37:20,870
which is its own thing,
but then physically doesn't that just,

2014
01:37:20,960 --> 01:37:23,420
he looks tired,
they're tired.

2015
01:37:23,690 --> 01:37:25,340
Well,
he didn't just do it.

2016
01:37:25,370 --> 01:37:28,160
He's kind of crazy.
I mean he's a good friend of mine.

2017
01:37:28,161 --> 01:37:29,690
I love him to death,
but he's crazy.

2018
01:37:29,840 --> 01:37:32,320
And this is one of the things he did.
He uh,

2019
01:37:32,480 --> 01:37:33,313
he lOst a ton of weight.
He went from 180 pounds down to below 

2020
01:37:36,531 --> 01:37:41,531
one slash 60 just by starving himself.
So he had his body eat itself.

2021
01:37:41,760 --> 01:37:43,840
So.
And because he was already lean,

2022
01:37:44,060 --> 01:37:44,893
like he didn't have any fat to lose.
So the only way for him to losE weight 

2023
01:37:47,120 --> 01:37:50,050
burn 3000 calories,
eat 2000.

2024
01:37:50,420 --> 01:37:54,170
So he did that for months until his body
looked shriveled away,

2025
01:37:54,440 --> 01:37:55,710
down to a,
like,

2026
01:37:55,830 --> 01:37:58,770
I think he got under 160 before he could
do this.

2027
01:37:59,350 --> 01:38:01,080
Like the other day he put a picture on 
his instagram.

2028
01:38:01,080 --> 01:38:04,830
He weighed 100 fifTy eight.
When I met him he weighed 180 and he was

2029
01:38:04,890 --> 01:38:08,970
built like you lift weights but he did 
one of these at 180.

2030
01:38:08,971 --> 01:38:12,120
And it was too hard,
so he decided to lose the weight.

2031
01:38:12,121 --> 01:38:12,954
So that's how we kind of discipline.
You have to just make your Body eat 

2032
01:38:15,781 --> 01:38:17,480
itself.
Like you don't have any faCts,

2033
01:38:17,850 --> 01:38:22,850
even at sub one 60 to run that that muCh
like to your knees,

2034
01:38:24,031 --> 01:38:25,860
your joints.
It's got to be brutal.

2035
01:38:25,861 --> 01:38:27,240
Right?
It's not good will.

2036
01:38:27,241 --> 01:38:28,074
That's what he said.
He said it's really like you could do 

2037
01:38:31,351 --> 01:38:34,070
performance enhancing drugs,
but it's really not necessarily going to

2038
01:38:34,071 --> 01:38:36,960
help you,
but really they're not going to help you

2039
01:38:37,050 --> 01:38:39,740
not feel pain or be able to be tough.
Like it's.

2040
01:38:39,750 --> 01:38:41,490
A lot of it is just being tough.
Yeah.

2041
01:38:41,610 --> 01:38:44,400
He's a tough son of man suffering.
Yeah.

2042
01:38:44,770 --> 01:38:45,660
Yeah.
He's a maniac.

2043
01:38:45,660 --> 01:38:46,493
He's got issues,
but he's also like one of the most 

2044
01:38:48,541 --> 01:38:51,250
successful bowhunters ever.
Really hasn't.

2045
01:38:51,450 --> 01:38:54,750
Bowhunting is the hardest thing in the 
world to do when it comes to acquisition

2046
01:38:54,751 --> 01:38:56,760
of meat.
Like there's no harder way to.

2047
01:38:56,880 --> 01:38:57,960
What state does he live?
In?

2048
01:38:58,050 --> 01:38:58,883
Oregon,
there's no harder way to get an animal 

2049
01:39:00,721 --> 01:39:03,480
than with a bow and arrow because you 
have to get within a certain distance.

2050
01:39:03,481 --> 01:39:05,190
You have to practice every day.
You have to,

2051
01:39:05,520 --> 01:39:06,353
and he hasn't had an unsuccessful 
bowhunt since 2009 and he goes every 

2052
01:39:10,350 --> 01:39:12,210
year and it kills multiple elk every 
year.

2053
01:39:12,300 --> 01:39:14,520
That's like unheard of.
Nobody does that.

2054
01:39:14,610 --> 01:39:18,240
Like everybody has dud dud trips like 
you go and you struck out,

2055
01:39:18,270 --> 01:39:20,170
you just don't see the right animals.
You don't get him.

2056
01:39:20,190 --> 01:39:21,990
He,
he's just.

2057
01:39:22,210 --> 01:39:23,043
I mean this one is designed for,
so he does and he just excels at it and 

2058
01:39:26,340 --> 01:39:29,070
if he doesn't find somebody just like 
runs 100 miles to the next spot,

2059
01:39:30,720 --> 01:39:31,553
I've hunted with them and the thing 
that's crazy is how he doesn't get 

2060
01:39:33,151 --> 01:39:35,040
tired.
LIke I'm in pretty good shape.

2061
01:39:35,041 --> 01:39:37,020
That's what I follow him up the hills.
I'm like,

2062
01:39:37,021 --> 01:39:38,290
fuck that.

2063
01:39:38,720 --> 01:39:43,460
Some people are wired like his sister 
maria is a similar level of lunacy.

2064
01:39:43,520 --> 01:39:45,810
Does she do marathons and shows you guys
like a.

2065
01:39:45,980 --> 01:39:48,910
She's done like trial half triathlons 
and uh,

2066
01:39:49,010 --> 01:39:49,843
she uh,
she did five point eight miles a day 

2067
01:39:51,231 --> 01:39:52,800
before she gave birth.
Whoa.

2068
01:39:55,370 --> 01:39:56,203
Oh my god.
And her uterus was falling out of her 

2069
01:39:58,761 --> 01:40:01,640
vagina from doing all that.
And the doctor said,

2070
01:40:01,641 --> 01:40:02,760
you gotta stop.
Dr.

2071
01:40:02,870 --> 01:40:04,610
Said he needed a nice system,
things up,

2072
01:40:05,300 --> 01:40:06,133
tighten it up unless ball size,
a nice little sister and she is one of 

2073
01:40:11,721 --> 01:40:14,140
those people that is always like,
do.

2074
01:40:15,560 --> 01:40:18,140
She's really athletic.
She was in the navy and she beat out all

2075
01:40:18,141 --> 01:40:20,150
the guys doing pushups.
Right?

2076
01:40:20,360 --> 01:40:23,480
She did the whole.
They have a pt test.

2077
01:40:24,110 --> 01:40:26,930
She beat all the women and all but one 
guy,

2078
01:40:27,350 --> 01:40:29,180
jesus christ.
Animal.

2079
01:40:29,290 --> 01:40:32,450
Just like a brother.
Hardcore guys like her brother.

2080
01:40:32,720 --> 01:40:36,440
Does she do those tough mudders?
Those are the weirdest mud.

2081
01:40:36,830 --> 01:40:40,380
People get sick as fuck.
They get diarrhea because for real.

2082
01:40:40,770 --> 01:40:43,010
What is this?
I don't know what the auditors are.

2083
01:40:43,070 --> 01:40:45,170
These crazy races where you have to go 
through.

2084
01:40:45,171 --> 01:40:46,004
You're literally running a lot of it 
through mugs that they're totally 

2085
01:40:50,661 --> 01:40:51,494
covered with mud,
but the problem with that is mud as 

2086
01:40:52,990 --> 01:40:53,823
water and still water is super bad.
People get that mud in their mouth and 

2087
01:40:58,781 --> 01:40:59,614
they get the pathogens shouldn't mud and
they just get a broken fire hydrant for 

2088
01:41:03,581 --> 01:41:04,414
an asshole.

2089
01:41:07,310 --> 01:41:09,460
Okay.
Bodies like just.

2090
01:41:09,461 --> 01:41:13,060
We're just getting rid of this whole 
machinery out.

2091
01:41:13,061 --> 01:41:15,850
It's like spring cleaning with a carpet 
cleaner.

2092
01:41:16,180 --> 01:41:19,900
It does look fun like the I think the 
running and you know what I mean,

2093
01:41:19,910 --> 01:41:24,490
like this is the month.
Oh these people are fucking maniac.

2094
01:41:24,670 --> 01:41:27,220
Told them this diarrhea.
Well they learn.

2095
01:41:27,280 --> 01:41:28,113
They learn.
I mean some people just really into it 

2096
01:41:29,471 --> 01:41:30,304
and they keep their mouth shut.
They know how to do it or keep their 

2097
01:41:31,841 --> 01:41:34,720
mouth closed and they don't.
They don't breathe it in,

2098
01:41:34,870 --> 01:41:36,820
but when they,
when you see them running through it,

2099
01:41:36,880 --> 01:41:38,420
it's like,
like they have all the.

2100
01:41:38,500 --> 01:41:40,510
What do you.
Yeah,

2101
01:41:40,511 --> 01:41:42,620
this is just people waiting dude.
But yeah,

2102
01:41:42,621 --> 01:41:45,850
I think this is an actual.
This is just people walking.

2103
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:46,833
There's,
there's some where you see them running 

2104
01:41:48,251 --> 01:41:49,084
and doing all this stuff.
This is just a bunch of people walking 

2105
01:41:50,471 --> 01:41:52,040
through a swamp,
get your life,

2106
01:41:52,090 --> 01:41:54,820
but if you do that crawl like sometimes 
you have to crawl under stuff too.

2107
01:41:54,820 --> 01:41:56,830
I guess that's when you can get it in 
your mouth.

2108
01:41:57,990 --> 01:42:02,890
The stupid sorry kind of things people 
do when it's so easy to get food.

2109
01:42:02,891 --> 01:42:07,891
That's what's that disease or he heard 
from him.

2110
01:42:09,340 --> 01:42:14,340
18 gender pronouns in Somalia and 
guarantee fucking races.

2111
01:42:14,440 --> 01:42:19,440
Gender phobic.
Look at this fucking maniacs.

2112
01:42:20,590 --> 01:42:22,740
Yep.
Waiting for.

2113
01:42:22,780 --> 01:42:25,060
Or most of these,
you know that question.

2114
01:42:25,470 --> 01:42:28,530
A tough couple of miles.
Some of them are about a mile in,

2115
01:42:28,531 --> 01:42:30,100
but tweak some of these obstacles so 
it's like six,

2116
01:42:30,101 --> 01:42:31,180
seven miles,
six,

2117
01:42:31,230 --> 01:42:33,640
seven miles.
They're literally,

2118
01:42:33,730 --> 01:42:36,540
they made mud for them to play in like 
33,

2119
01:42:37,270 --> 01:42:38,103
33,
but this is a setup like they make all 

2120
01:42:40,990 --> 01:42:43,000
this.
This is so goofy.

2121
01:42:43,690 --> 01:42:45,010
Sorry folks.
If you're listening,

2122
01:42:45,770 --> 01:42:50,770
you want to try it.
Maybe I.

2123
01:42:51,940 --> 01:42:56,940
Maybe I don't want fucking pathogens.
The giardia and they didn't take.

2124
01:42:57,511 --> 01:42:59,840
Take that muskrat shIt.
This is real.

2125
01:43:00,030 --> 01:43:02,650
This is a real hate mail episode.

2126
01:43:03,100 --> 01:43:07,270
We always bring the gender stuff this 
time.

2127
01:43:08,180 --> 01:43:09,860
Not real gender stuff though.
No,

2128
01:43:10,100 --> 01:43:10,960
no,
no,

2129
01:43:11,110 --> 01:43:12,580
no fake stuff.
No,

2130
01:43:12,581 --> 01:43:14,140
not the legit people.
They're like,

2131
01:43:14,141 --> 01:43:14,880
dude,
I'm a.

2132
01:43:14,880 --> 01:43:18,160
I'm a man.
Trapped in a woman's body obviously.

2133
01:43:18,340 --> 01:43:21,130
Right?
But just keep yourself.

2134
01:43:22,260 --> 01:43:27,260
Keep your weird shit.
That shit some persons good.

2135
01:43:29,110 --> 01:43:31,900
I'm telling you the 19 fifties.
Not all bad.

2136
01:43:31,990 --> 01:43:32,823
No,
but you know there was a transgender 

2137
01:43:34,091 --> 01:43:37,240
people pour in the turn of the century.
Turn of the 20th century.

2138
01:43:37,560 --> 01:43:40,390
There's a lot of photos of transgender 
people from back then.

2139
01:43:40,530 --> 01:43:41,363
it's always been a thing.
I used to see more in hollywood when I 

2140
01:43:44,081 --> 01:43:44,914
lived there 15 years ago.
I just don't buy the going back and 

2141
01:43:47,081 --> 01:43:47,914
forth.
Sorry.

2142
01:43:48,500 --> 01:43:52,850
I don't think most people do.
I think it's an attention seeking,

2143
01:43:53,310 --> 01:43:54,000
uh,
some,

2144
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:55,670
something,
something else is going on there.

2145
01:43:55,790 --> 01:43:58,350
I think not all your feelings should be 
acknowledged by.

2146
01:43:58,900 --> 01:44:00,470
That's important.
I agree.

2147
01:44:00,620 --> 01:44:01,453
That's important.
You like this guy wants to be the six 

2148
01:44:03,171 --> 01:44:05,480
year old girl.
I mean they have specials on him and now

2149
01:44:05,481 --> 01:44:06,930
he's 57 years old.
I can't,

2150
01:44:07,790 --> 01:44:08,623
I can't.
TheY don't have specials on him because 

2151
01:44:10,420 --> 01:44:11,253
her extraordinary story,
they have specials on him because you 

2152
01:44:13,011 --> 01:44:13,844
know,
it's ridiculous and you're going to 

2153
01:44:14,421 --> 01:44:15,120
watch it.
Yeah.

2154
01:44:15,120 --> 01:44:16,940
It's funny.
It's weird.

2155
01:44:17,040 --> 01:44:17,590
Yeah.
You'll look.

2156
01:44:17,590 --> 01:44:20,280
You can't go back in time,
right?

2157
01:44:20,300 --> 01:44:22,520
You lived a long time.
You have to be responsible.

2158
01:44:22,530 --> 01:44:23,363
They have a special on him.
The same reason they have a special and 

2159
01:44:24,970 --> 01:44:26,300
a lady who doesn't cut her toenails.

2160
01:44:28,500 --> 01:44:30,200
Look,
these are my special name.

2161
01:44:32,890 --> 01:44:37,880
It's so true and I can't get a job.
They could never get a job.

2162
01:44:37,881 --> 01:44:40,400
That's the.
These people are employed.

2163
01:44:40,500 --> 01:44:42,860
that is the one common denominator.
What is your,

2164
01:44:42,861 --> 01:44:44,180
what do you do for living?
Not anymore.

2165
01:44:44,320 --> 01:44:48,290
That's discrimination by the way.
You're discriminating against her guys.

2166
01:44:48,890 --> 01:44:49,723
Well,
I've heard people discuss the merits of 

2167
01:44:51,350 --> 01:44:55,310
the sacred argument where you're not 
allowed to cut your hair because of your

2168
01:44:55,311 --> 01:44:56,170
religion.
Right?

2169
01:44:56,450 --> 01:44:57,290
And I'm like,
well listen,

2170
01:44:57,320 --> 01:44:59,390
at the end of the day,
it's just your fucking hair.

2171
01:44:59,530 --> 01:45:02,600
And if your religion is about cutting 
your hair or not cutting your hair,

2172
01:45:02,601 --> 01:45:05,150
I'm sorry,
but it might be bullshit.

2173
01:45:05,400 --> 01:45:06,750
Yeah.
Yeah,

2174
01:45:06,900 --> 01:45:08,240
you can't.
So if you can't,

2175
01:45:08,241 --> 01:45:09,260
you can't just say,
hey,

2176
01:45:09,261 --> 01:45:10,610
my hair is getting in the way.
I'm just gonna cut it.

2177
01:45:13,310 --> 01:45:14,720
Who says that?
Who says you can.

2178
01:45:14,780 --> 01:45:19,780
I know you're talking about your swami 
tells you you can't do it.

2179
01:45:21,021 --> 01:45:23,320
Is it written somewhere?
What's happening?

2180
01:45:23,370 --> 01:45:25,730
You can't just cut your hair and for the
same guy.

2181
01:45:25,830 --> 01:45:27,500
No ma'am.
Sacred.

2182
01:45:27,980 --> 01:45:30,060
God's going to punish you.
If you eat meat on friday.

2183
01:45:30,080 --> 01:45:35,080
Older you get the more absurd,
the religious,

2184
01:45:35,360 --> 01:45:36,500
um,
you know,

2185
01:45:36,890 --> 01:45:38,560
customs and,
and yamaka.

2186
01:45:38,561 --> 01:45:39,960
So all the,
all the,

2187
01:45:40,940 --> 01:45:45,940
all the prints off the meeting,
that meat eating anD the wash stuff over

2188
01:45:47,511 --> 01:45:48,344
here,
like all that we have in our rental 

2189
01:45:51,021 --> 01:45:52,820
house.
Not because we have some.

2190
01:45:52,860 --> 01:45:56,920
A couple of shoots.
Yeah,

2191
01:45:56,990 --> 01:45:59,300
it's all.
It's all kosher kitchen.

2192
01:45:59,301 --> 01:46:00,134
It's fine.
I support fully that if you don't want 

2193
01:46:02,781 --> 01:46:03,614
to ever cut your hair again,
you should be able to not cut your hair 

2194
01:46:05,571 --> 01:46:06,404
again.
If you want to grow your hair crazy law 

2195
01:46:07,521 --> 01:46:08,750
and grow your beard crazy long.

2196
01:46:08,890 --> 01:46:09,723
Yeah.
My problem is if you think a dad wants 

2197
01:46:12,231 --> 01:46:15,080
you to do that,
I think that there's some mystical guy.

2198
01:46:15,170 --> 01:46:16,250
If you just say,
you know what?

2199
01:46:16,400 --> 01:46:19,250
I just like it getting crazy,
crazy,

2200
01:46:19,820 --> 01:46:23,570
crazy asshole hair.
I just liked being hairy,

2201
01:46:23,571 --> 01:46:24,990
man.
I liked the feeling like,

2202
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:26,160
okay,
upset.

2203
01:46:26,810 --> 01:46:28,460
Nobody fucks with rick rubin.
Right,

2204
01:46:28,520 --> 01:46:30,320
right.
Rick rubin,

2205
01:46:30,321 --> 01:46:33,170
just let's go.
Let's all go to the hair on top.

2206
01:46:33,171 --> 01:46:34,130
All,
all fucked up.

2207
01:46:34,131 --> 01:46:39,131
The beards all fucked up for jag.
A rolls royce crazier.

2208
01:46:40,130 --> 01:46:45,130
You look and then you have like a 
fucking car and he's a handsome fella.

2209
01:46:45,431 --> 01:46:48,450
And he thought that shit just decides 
that says,

2210
01:46:48,500 --> 01:46:51,210
look,
his fucking full on crazy hair.

2211
01:46:51,290 --> 01:46:53,820
You're not so far.
I feel like you're almost there.

2212
01:46:53,850 --> 01:46:55,650
You could let that go.
Why don't you see if,

2213
01:46:55,651 --> 01:46:57,390
um,
I think though as a comic,

2214
01:46:57,391 --> 01:46:59,550
you're better off without that kind of 
thing.

2215
01:46:59,950 --> 01:47:02,250
So.
And you're marrIed to that look,

2216
01:47:02,251 --> 01:47:02,881
right?
Well,

2217
01:47:02,881 --> 01:47:03,714
what's that guy's name?
He's at the store though sometimes he 

2218
01:47:06,091 --> 01:47:06,924
has quite a look.
You know,

2219
01:47:06,940 --> 01:47:07,800
I'm talking about.
He's like,

2220
01:47:08,100 --> 01:47:11,220
he was a cab driver.
He holds his coat over his,

2221
01:47:11,280 --> 01:47:12,860
over his arm or his.
No.

2222
01:47:13,110 --> 01:47:16,720
And he's got all the notes.
Triply london.

2223
01:47:16,900 --> 01:47:18,150
J.london.
Yeah.

2224
01:47:18,640 --> 01:47:19,680
Look,
that's a look.

2225
01:47:21,140 --> 01:47:25,140
I know what I'm saying.
Like rick rubin,

2226
01:47:25,200 --> 01:47:26,760
rick rubin,
and a rolls royce.

2227
01:47:26,880 --> 01:47:30,250
Because I've seen several.
It's just funny thing.

2228
01:47:30,330 --> 01:47:34,860
Funny about a guy who looks like a 
homeless guy or like crazy la street guy

2229
01:47:35,260 --> 01:47:37,920
favorite and they're just gazillionaires
and you'd never know it.

2230
01:47:38,380 --> 01:47:39,213
And the nla,
anybody that walks into a store or 

2231
01:47:41,431 --> 01:47:46,431
restaurant that looks fucking homeless 
could be worth $500,000,000,

2232
01:47:47,230 --> 01:47:48,480
I think.
Like she would.

2233
01:47:48,570 --> 01:47:50,780
Sikhs.
Sikhs aren't allowed to cut their hair.

2234
01:47:52,380 --> 01:47:55,240
Remarkably cool people.
I've met a lot of them,

2235
01:47:55,241 --> 01:47:56,430
especially in toronto.

2236
01:47:56,430 --> 01:47:58,290
There's a big sikh population in 
toronto.

2237
01:47:58,320 --> 01:48:00,000
Sure,
some of the nicest,

2238
01:48:00,001 --> 01:48:00,834
coolest people,
but they just have that thing that's so 

2239
01:48:05,080 --> 01:48:05,821
you could say,
well,

2240
01:48:05,821 --> 01:48:06,654
yeah,
I mean he believes that a dad wants him 

2241
01:48:08,641 --> 01:48:09,900
to do,
but another thing you would say,

2242
01:48:09,901 --> 01:48:10,734
well maybe it identifies you with this 
group of people and you feel like 

2243
01:48:13,560 --> 01:48:14,393
outsiders and you feel like if you grow 
your hair and wear it wrapped up like 

2244
01:48:17,041 --> 01:48:17,874
that,
like you feel like you fit in with that 

2245
01:48:20,130 --> 01:48:20,963
group with your group.
Since I grew up in la with a bunch of 

2246
01:48:23,821 --> 01:48:26,410
seed kids,
made fun of them.

2247
01:48:27,390 --> 01:48:28,223
Just call them onion heads or whatever 
and it was fucked up for them is what 

2248
01:48:30,601 --> 01:48:31,434
I'm saying,
because then you get singled out and 

2249
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:35,970
fucked with by.
Your wife doesn't want you to,

2250
01:48:36,120 --> 01:48:37,170
you know,
get teased.

2251
01:48:37,171 --> 01:48:38,520
Relentless.
That's your point.

2252
01:48:38,700 --> 01:48:41,010
That's my point.
He didn't want you to be bullied.

2253
01:48:41,330 --> 01:48:44,940
Look at that article.
The white and jewish men that run rap.

2254
01:48:45,860 --> 01:48:47,460
Oh,
that's hilarious.

2255
01:48:47,850 --> 01:48:50,300
The one major record companies.
Yeah.

2256
01:48:51,260 --> 01:48:52,580
Well,
no,

2257
01:48:52,860 --> 01:48:55,570
but he's dressed like a dude who lives 
in seattle,

2258
01:48:55,730 --> 01:48:56,563
jacl.

2259
01:48:58,990 --> 01:49:01,630
What's what's in his hand?
It looks like a.

2260
01:49:03,120 --> 01:49:08,120
So that is weird bro.
That's a very weird look.

2261
01:49:10,530 --> 01:49:14,510
Those prayer beads in front of a private
jet with jay z.

2262
01:49:14,510 --> 01:49:16,170
Tracy's got a $25,000
suit on.

2263
01:49:19,790 --> 01:49:22,920
Who is that with them seal.
What happened to that dude?

2264
01:49:23,340 --> 01:49:24,173
Well,
funny you should ask key member when he 

2265
01:49:25,561 --> 01:49:26,394
sang recently in public for the first 
time in like a million years and it was 

2266
01:49:30,001 --> 01:49:31,390
really bad.
Oh no,

2267
01:49:31,420 --> 01:49:32,253
no.
It wasn't the first time in a million 

2268
01:49:33,211 --> 01:49:33,910
years.
No,

2269
01:49:33,910 --> 01:49:36,480
it wasn't.
I know,

2270
01:49:36,550 --> 01:49:39,350
but it wasn't the first time in a 
million years.

2271
01:49:39,351 --> 01:49:40,184
No,
no,

2272
01:49:41,800 --> 01:49:44,490
he just sang.
He sang on the super bowl pregame show.

2273
01:49:44,630 --> 01:49:46,730
It wasn't good.
It was terrific.

2274
01:49:47,480 --> 01:49:48,610
He's,
he's been.

2275
01:49:48,700 --> 01:49:50,530
He didn't,
he never went away.

2276
01:49:50,710 --> 01:49:52,180
He left the game.
Not at all.

2277
01:49:53,090 --> 01:49:54,070
He's,
he's banging.

2278
01:49:54,071 --> 01:49:54,904
What's her name?
Hide the clue to know all your facts on 

2279
01:49:59,711 --> 01:50:00,544
this or not.
Right.

2280
01:50:01,650 --> 01:50:03,970
I don't know shit about celebrities come
on,

2281
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:04,833
but it was a terrible performance.
Do you know like certain songs or 

2282
01:50:08,471 --> 01:50:13,471
certain musicians like bring you back to
a time in your life with seals?

2283
01:50:13,870 --> 01:50:18,040
The first time ever bought a stereo 
stereo,

2284
01:50:18,041 --> 01:50:18,874
had a buy and I was dating this girl who
was really into music and she told me 

2285
01:50:22,061 --> 01:50:23,960
you have to get this seal out my work.
Really?

2286
01:50:26,160 --> 01:50:27,860
Yeah.
And I had it set up.

2287
01:50:27,880 --> 01:50:28,713
I bought an actual stereo for the first 
time in my life and I had a one big 

2288
01:50:32,291 --> 01:50:35,940
speaker to the like I had speakers that 
were on stands that got off the floor.

2289
01:50:35,960 --> 01:50:39,070
Those are great.
I didn't even have a couch yet and I had

2290
01:50:39,071 --> 01:50:42,220
this uh,
this stereo that sounded really good and

2291
01:50:42,221 --> 01:50:44,620
I played the cd,
set it all up myself.

2292
01:50:44,621 --> 01:50:47,050
I put the wires in the right holes and 
pinch them down.

2293
01:50:48,070 --> 01:50:48,880
And then,
uh,

2294
01:50:48,880 --> 01:50:52,090
I played that cd and where you have like
one big speaker over here,

2295
01:50:52,091 --> 01:50:55,540
one over there and you could hear the 
sound like moving around back and forth.

2296
01:50:55,541 --> 01:50:57,280
And I really appreciated what he was 
doing.

2297
01:50:57,281 --> 01:50:58,114
Like,
I'd never heard it before and anything 

2298
01:50:59,051 --> 01:51:01,870
but like shitty car stereos with like 
blown speakers,

2299
01:51:02,210 --> 01:51:04,000
you know,
talented dude for sure.

2300
01:51:04,450 --> 01:51:05,283
And when we were talking about earlier,
you made a good point about that song 

2301
01:51:08,741 --> 01:51:12,190
whenever I got like,
dad's like that song.

2302
01:51:12,270 --> 01:51:12,880
Yeah.
Yeah.

2303
01:51:12,880 --> 01:51:17,880
Everyone likes that song.
There's dads even with their fat gut,

2304
01:51:17,951 --> 01:51:22,951
we're driving electric golf course or 
they want to pretend they're still going

2305
01:51:24,590 --> 01:51:25,423
to get a little crazy.
My whole family with everybody and mike 

2306
01:51:35,290 --> 01:51:39,960
can just go to this place.
Just I have a switch that switch goes.

2307
01:51:40,020 --> 01:51:41,050
I don't even know.
You know,

2308
01:51:41,320 --> 01:51:44,110
you have to wake me up after it's over,
you know,

2309
01:51:44,760 --> 01:51:49,330
a free.
My dad definitely probably just had that

2310
01:51:49,331 --> 01:51:50,164
on a loop,
you know,

2311
01:51:50,320 --> 01:51:53,410
just like,
of course your dad liked it.

2312
01:51:53,450 --> 01:51:55,600
No,
my dad liked prodigy a lot.

2313
01:51:55,630 --> 01:51:58,210
Like he would get ripped and just play 
that through the house,

2314
01:51:58,211 --> 01:52:00,850
like on the file.
So horrible.

2315
01:52:00,851 --> 01:52:02,320
Oh yeah.
I hated it.

2316
01:52:02,890 --> 01:52:04,330
You remember that one?
Drank too much.

2317
01:52:04,360 --> 01:52:05,193
Crazy song.
That was like a big one too that 

2318
01:52:06,461 --> 01:52:09,790
everybody would crank in their car was a
seal one.

2319
01:52:09,880 --> 01:52:10,390
No,
no,

2320
01:52:10,390 --> 01:52:11,223
no,
no,

2321
01:52:11,420 --> 01:52:13,840
no,
no,

2322
01:52:13,960 --> 01:52:16,390
no,
no dad's song.

2323
01:52:16,410 --> 01:52:21,410
You mean to go there?
Isn't lost my mind.

2324
01:52:24,370 --> 01:52:25,380
Oh yeah,
yeah,

2325
01:52:25,390 --> 01:52:25,691
yeah,
yeah.

2326
01:52:25,691 --> 01:52:30,140
Hold on that special time.
How's that go kind of thing.

2327
01:52:33,670 --> 01:52:38,500
Cielo cielo.
Before the ecstasy charge.

2328
01:52:42,070 --> 01:52:42,903
Charles barkley cielo is.
Fuck you barkley with swift danger 

2329
01:52:46,791 --> 01:52:47,490
mouse.
It's like a.

2330
01:52:47,490 --> 01:52:49,150
Alright,
so cielo is a singer.

2331
01:52:49,430 --> 01:52:50,263
Oh,
he's in.

2332
01:52:50,560 --> 01:52:55,560
It was a dude that is a universally 
loved song till people love to think I'm

2333
01:52:59,470 --> 01:53:03,120
just crazy.
The andre andre 3000 song.

2334
01:53:03,720 --> 01:53:05,620
What was that?
Hey,

2335
01:53:05,630 --> 01:53:09,090
a lot of dads can get into it.
You know,

2336
01:53:09,260 --> 01:53:10,880
it's not just for the kids,
right?

2337
01:53:10,940 --> 01:53:11,540
Yeah,
that's true.

2338
01:53:11,540 --> 01:53:13,160
Like outcast.
That's for the kids,

2339
01:53:13,161 --> 01:53:16,210
but that song that's going to listen to 
ads only.

2340
01:53:16,270 --> 01:53:19,430
It's like jazz sophisticated.
Yeah.

2341
01:53:20,050 --> 01:53:20,710
Yeah.
It's like,

2342
01:53:20,710 --> 01:53:21,990
no,
I like black kids music.

2343
01:53:23,810 --> 01:53:24,643
Kids listening to.
I was listening to this rap song where 

2344
01:53:28,280 --> 01:53:29,113
they were talking.
This guy was trying to romance this 

2345
01:53:30,411 --> 01:53:31,244
girl.
He was talking about playing chess with 

2346
01:53:32,421 --> 01:53:37,310
her and eating organic food and 
listening to jazz in the song.

2347
01:53:37,380 --> 01:53:38,213
Yeah.
Yeah.

2348
01:53:38,330 --> 01:53:42,350
In a rap song trying to romance this 
girl organic vegan.

2349
01:53:43,070 --> 01:53:48,070
You know what song I was listening?
I was watching an episode of glee.

2350
01:53:48,200 --> 01:53:49,640
I don't know why.
No,

2351
01:53:49,700 --> 01:53:53,180
I know I'm becoming horribly lame.
And they played that song.

2352
01:53:53,181 --> 01:53:58,181
The thong song she had dumped like a 
tribe track track.

2353
01:53:59,780 --> 01:54:03,710
She took dumps like a truck.
No dumps like a truck.

2354
01:54:03,711 --> 01:54:06,680
Like her ass is like a dump truck.
Dumper.

2355
01:54:06,980 --> 01:54:11,980
Dumps like a truck.
I know that her dumps or her just trying

2356
01:54:12,171 --> 01:54:14,840
to make things run more.
You look into it,

2357
01:54:15,440 --> 01:54:16,750
they'll fuck you up.
Cisco,

2358
01:54:18,860 --> 01:54:21,440
we can't go down the rabbit hole.
There's the thong song.

2359
01:54:21,680 --> 01:54:22,513
Cisco.
How long ago was this made that James 

2360
01:54:27,710 --> 01:54:28,900
Brown was a baby?
Yeah.

2361
01:54:29,030 --> 01:54:31,940
Cisco had a gang of buses.
What's he doing now?

2362
01:54:35,760 --> 01:54:38,390
Look at these gullies buses.
He says five buses pull up.

2363
01:54:38,391 --> 01:54:40,370
They say cisco on them.
I want everything.

2364
01:54:40,371 --> 01:54:42,670
White dong.
Dong dong.

2365
01:54:44,810 --> 01:54:46,430
There you go.
There you go.

2366
01:54:46,730 --> 01:54:47,570
Yeah,
he's still there.

2367
01:54:47,571 --> 01:54:51,580
You go.
Hey tommy,

2368
01:54:51,590 --> 01:54:54,110
you fucking got me on the gucci mane.
You son of a bitch.

2369
01:54:54,650 --> 01:54:58,770
You son of a bitch.
I was listening to gucci mane,

2370
01:54:58,970 --> 01:55:00,950
some new gucci mane thing the other 
night.

2371
01:55:00,951 --> 01:55:03,140
I'm like,
he wrote that five minutes ago.

2372
01:55:03,560 --> 01:55:05,990
He wrote that on cough syrup five 
minutes ago,

2373
01:55:07,700 --> 01:55:09,620
straight out the fed.
Met first day of the fence.

2374
01:55:09,621 --> 01:55:10,910
You got a new app,
new album.

2375
01:55:13,310 --> 01:55:15,440
He lost a lot of weight in prison.
You notice that?

2376
01:55:15,530 --> 01:55:16,850
Yeah.
He's got a six pack now.

2377
01:55:17,080 --> 01:55:18,500
He really lost a lot.
Yeah.

2378
01:55:18,560 --> 01:55:23,560
He has a ice cream cone on his face.
Burn burn wIth a lightning bolts.

2379
01:55:28,710 --> 01:55:30,350
That's hilarious.
She doesn't play man.

2380
01:55:30,351 --> 01:55:32,990
Young thug and gucci mane.
His young protege.

2381
01:55:32,991 --> 01:55:34,460
Young thug.
He's a little bit of.

2382
01:55:34,530 --> 01:55:36,110
I don't know.
I wouldn't call them fluid gender.

2383
01:55:36,111 --> 01:55:38,480
I'm not going to say that,
but he's a fashion designer.

2384
01:55:38,481 --> 01:55:41,000
He was first of all,
gender fluid.

2385
01:55:41,070 --> 01:55:44,150
God,
you are going to miss gender.

2386
01:55:45,150 --> 01:55:50,150
Gender id on my jeans were a little 
whack.

2387
01:55:50,370 --> 01:55:53,400
Tommy likes standing out.
Let's not.

2388
01:55:53,430 --> 01:55:57,200
Let's not light denim.
Denim with you.

2389
01:55:57,210 --> 01:55:58,043
Would like though from from before,
before he got locked up the lemonade 

2390
01:56:02,041 --> 01:56:02,851
song.
Oh,

2391
01:56:02,851 --> 01:56:03,571
I've heard that.
Be like,

2392
01:56:03,571 --> 01:56:04,620
yeah,
that's a catchy.

2393
01:56:04,621 --> 01:56:07,050
So I mean dad's can listen to it.
How'd it go?

2394
01:56:08,760 --> 01:56:10,170
How can,
how does it go?

2395
01:56:11,260 --> 01:56:16,260
We're being invaded.
How's it going?

2396
01:56:17,920 --> 01:56:20,610
It goes next door.
Neighbors alarms going off.

2397
01:56:20,640 --> 01:56:23,590
Oh,
is it called the purge?

2398
01:56:24,630 --> 01:56:26,580
Yes.
The purge have a sandWich.

2399
01:56:26,600 --> 01:56:27,433
Sorry.

2400
01:56:29,110 --> 01:56:32,830
How does that song go?
Sing your lemonade lemonade.

2401
01:56:34,270 --> 01:56:35,103
Yellow,
yellow,

2402
01:56:35,500 --> 01:56:37,750
yellow birds.
Yellow diamonds in my head.

2403
01:56:37,780 --> 01:56:38,650
Yellow,
yellow,

2404
01:56:38,651 --> 01:56:39,950
yellow.
That's good.

2405
01:56:40,450 --> 01:56:42,610
That's how it starts.
So I think maybe he makes things.

2406
01:56:43,070 --> 01:56:47,680
Dun dun dun dun dun dun dun.
You like it negative?

2407
01:56:47,740 --> 01:56:48,220
no.
alright,

2408
01:56:48,220 --> 01:56:49,860
I'll play it for you.
That somebody likes it though.

2409
01:56:50,620 --> 01:56:52,150
Lots of people.
That song's catchy.

2410
01:56:52,151 --> 01:56:53,740
Actually.
I'm the minority here.

2411
01:56:54,950 --> 01:56:56,680
I cut it from youtube.
Yeah,

2412
01:56:56,890 --> 01:56:57,723
he's cutting it off of youtube so we 
won't get pulled from youtube so people 

2413
01:57:00,341 --> 01:57:01,174
can hear this on.

2414
01:57:02,400 --> 01:57:05,910
So you get a yellow,
yellow like gold,

2415
01:57:05,911 --> 01:57:09,080
right?
Like money for awhile.

2416
01:57:12,680 --> 01:57:14,690
Yeah.
Yeah.

2417
01:57:14,880 --> 01:57:15,870
Okay.
It's the melody.

2418
01:57:16,270 --> 01:57:17,940
Yeah.
It sounds good though.

2419
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:19,980
It seems like he's having a good time.
How big he is there?

2420
01:57:20,220 --> 01:57:23,550
He definitely had more body fat.
Probably do our pushups in the house.

2421
01:57:23,620 --> 01:57:26,620
Yeah.
Then you got to eat and up focused.

2422
01:57:26,990 --> 01:57:29,430
Probably wrote some good shit.
And this is all pre tattoo to.

2423
01:57:29,910 --> 01:57:31,170
Yeah,
we had a few then though,

2424
01:57:31,200 --> 01:57:32,033
but not on the face baby.
He's got my favorite all time saying to 

2425
01:57:36,901 --> 01:57:40,080
a judge,
mr jermaine,

2426
01:57:40,340 --> 01:57:41,161
are you guilty?
He goes,

2427
01:57:41,161 --> 01:57:45,590
bitch,
I might be right.

2428
01:57:46,500 --> 01:57:48,150
He said that.
No,

2429
01:57:48,180 --> 01:57:50,880
he said that.
I thought that was funny.

2430
01:57:51,120 --> 01:57:54,080
Gucci mane did not want him.
Might be it's hoax.

2431
01:57:55,760 --> 01:57:58,680
Why did you ruin it for me?
Dark.

2432
01:57:58,710 --> 01:57:59,970
Damn dude.
I'm sorry.

2433
01:58:00,110 --> 01:58:01,080
I know jamie.

2434
01:58:01,330 --> 01:58:02,163
Keeping the dark.
Keeping in the dark on things that are 

2435
01:58:04,051 --> 01:58:05,130
too good,
bitch.

2436
01:58:05,131 --> 01:58:07,890
I might be his greatest thing ever.
Say that to a judge.

2437
01:58:07,891 --> 01:58:09,480
Gender.
No fucker.

2438
01:58:09,930 --> 01:58:11,580
Sorry.
I was talking to jamie privileged.

2439
01:58:12,830 --> 01:58:14,040
Jamie,
you are so privileged.

2440
01:58:15,240 --> 01:58:16,560
Guilty bitch.
I might be.

2441
01:58:17,250 --> 01:58:18,083
Come on.
Be one of the greatest things that 

2442
01:58:18,991 --> 01:58:21,870
anybody could say ever.
Disrespect guys.

2443
01:58:21,871 --> 01:58:24,150
Nineteen fifties.
There's some great videos.

2444
01:58:24,151 --> 01:58:25,590
By the way,
if you're ever bored.

2445
01:58:25,591 --> 01:58:27,030
I don't know if you ever looked up on 
youtube.

2446
01:58:27,450 --> 01:58:29,490
Judges handling,

2447
01:58:29,980 --> 01:58:30,813
um,
people acting out of line at sentencing 

2448
01:58:32,911 --> 01:58:33,990
thing.
It's incredible.

2449
01:58:33,991 --> 01:58:34,824
Yeah.
Have you ever seen the one where the 

2450
01:58:35,791 --> 01:58:36,624
girl.
Yeah.

2451
01:58:36,840 --> 01:58:37,673
Is like a.
She said something in spanish to this 

2452
01:58:41,620 --> 01:58:42,070
cuban

2453
01:58:42,070 --> 01:58:43,550
judge in miami.
He's like,

2454
01:58:43,600 --> 01:58:45,570
he has a really heavy accent.
oh,

2455
01:58:45,571 --> 01:58:48,280
I remember you ever seen that?
It's unbelievable.

2456
01:58:48,310 --> 01:58:49,730
This is it.
That's it right there.

2457
01:58:49,960 --> 01:58:51,160
It's unbelievable,
man.

2458
01:58:51,360 --> 01:58:53,440
And you flipped.
She flipped the bird to the judge.

2459
01:58:53,441 --> 01:58:54,274
She,
unless she says something in spanish to 

2460
01:58:56,471 --> 01:59:00,090
be cheeky to him.
And then he's like,

2461
01:59:00,190 --> 01:59:02,050
going back here.
what did you say?

2462
01:59:02,320 --> 01:59:03,130
And she's like,
oh,

2463
01:59:03,130 --> 01:59:03,963
I said like one of the ears.
And he gives her like an extra 30 days 

2464
01:59:07,630 --> 01:59:09,310
and then she's like,
gives flicks them off walk.

2465
01:59:09,311 --> 01:59:10,360
He's like,
come back again.

2466
01:59:10,600 --> 01:59:13,150
And he gives her like an extra 90 days.
Whoa.

2467
01:59:13,180 --> 01:59:14,530
She thinks she cute.
That's why,

2468
01:59:14,590 --> 01:59:15,860
you know what I'm saying?
She was pretty.

2469
01:59:17,110 --> 01:59:20,620
She was like laughing and stuff.
Yeah.

2470
01:59:21,120 --> 01:59:23,350
He,
he fucking rushes her.

2471
01:59:23,470 --> 01:59:25,140
Isn't that interesting?
That it's a,

2472
01:59:25,150 --> 01:59:26,940
the judge's discretion?
Yeah.

2473
01:59:27,180 --> 01:59:29,680
Can do that.
How weird is that?

2474
01:59:29,890 --> 01:59:30,723
That shouldn't be the case.
Shouldn't be like you're punishing her 

2475
01:59:33,730 --> 01:59:37,600
because she's being disrespectful to you
or to the court itself.

2476
01:59:37,660 --> 01:59:38,493
To both.
I think that you have to respect the 

2477
01:59:39,611 --> 01:59:40,444
court.
Did you see what they did to that 

2478
01:59:41,141 --> 01:59:43,550
Alabama judge know he.
There was.

2479
01:59:44,260 --> 01:59:48,330
Oh yeah.
Here we will get yanked yogi.

2480
01:59:48,540 --> 01:59:49,820
Want to hear what he says to say to her?

2481
01:59:53,490 --> 01:59:55,870
It has no sound.
Oh really?

2482
01:59:56,290 --> 01:59:57,310
Oh,
oh.

2483
01:59:57,311 --> 01:59:59,080
It was probably like the courtroom 
camera.

2484
01:59:59,230 --> 02:00:01,050
St.
Actual courtroom can come back.

2485
02:00:02,080 --> 02:00:05,350
Tomal did the backyard.
She's laughing and smiling.

2486
02:00:07,120 --> 02:00:09,730
Funny how people when they're in a 
position like that,

2487
02:00:09,770 --> 02:00:13,150
you're caught like you're in court and 
they have all the power.

2488
02:00:13,360 --> 02:00:14,890
You want to pretend like you don't give 
a fuck.

2489
02:00:15,610 --> 02:00:17,440
No,
I'd give a lot of fuck.

2490
02:00:17,960 --> 02:00:20,800
If I were in front of a judge,
I'd be very,

2491
02:00:20,830 --> 02:00:24,730
very respectful and scared.
She just flipped him off.

2492
02:00:24,860 --> 02:00:27,550
Yeah.
Now he's angry.

2493
02:00:27,610 --> 02:00:30,370
Oh yeah.
that's amazing that he can just do that.

2494
02:00:31,990 --> 02:00:34,750
It's kind of amazing because that's 
almost too much power.

2495
02:00:34,890 --> 02:00:37,000
Like I understand that you are violating
the court,

2496
02:00:37,001 --> 02:00:37,834
but should it really be up to the judge 
to arbitrarily decide to give you 30 

2497
02:00:40,781 --> 02:00:41,614
more days or 90 more days or whatever 
they give you shouldn't really be up to 

2498
02:00:45,821 --> 02:00:46,150
him.

2499
02:00:46,150 --> 02:00:46,983
I mean maybe there's a rule,
like if you say the f word or if you 

2500
02:00:49,391 --> 02:00:51,070
give someone the finger,
you get an automatic,

2501
02:00:51,071 --> 02:00:51,970
like whatever.
Oh,

2502
02:00:51,971 --> 02:00:54,460
but then they'd be able to pick rule.
I don't know.

2503
02:00:54,461 --> 02:00:57,730
Maybe it is.
Maybe that's contempt of court,

2504
02:00:57,731 --> 02:00:59,140
isn't it?
Guys?

2505
02:00:59,141 --> 02:01:03,900
I went to law school for two weeks and 
contempt of court to,

2506
02:01:03,901 --> 02:01:05,710
uh,
to be disrespectful.

2507
02:01:05,711 --> 02:01:06,130
Right?
Yeah,

2508
02:01:06,130 --> 02:01:08,800
for sure.
You're not supposed to flIp off a judge.

2509
02:01:08,860 --> 02:01:10,390
You're supposed to dress a certaIn way.
I mean,

2510
02:01:10,391 --> 02:01:12,160
obviously the jumpsuit thing is its own 
thing,

2511
02:01:12,161 --> 02:01:12,611
but like,
yeah,

2512
02:01:12,611 --> 02:01:15,130
you're supposed to respect the court.
The judge was,

2513
02:01:15,131 --> 02:01:18,430
she had to wear the jumpsuit,
but do you,

2514
02:01:18,431 --> 02:01:19,264
um,
do you think that the judge can just 

2515
02:01:20,231 --> 02:01:23,000
decide how many days he gives you?
I mean,

2516
02:01:23,020 --> 02:01:27,220
there's got to be a limit to it.
Like you can't be set to for contempt,

2517
02:01:27,221 --> 02:01:29,520
but shit,
he look at that curses.

2518
02:01:29,530 --> 02:01:31,300
Judge gets a year.
Wow.

2519
02:01:31,440 --> 02:01:34,420
Chris judge judges 364 days in jail for 
contempt.

2520
02:01:34,470 --> 02:01:37,660
Oh,
well he's domestic violence asshole.

2521
02:01:38,380 --> 02:01:40,130
I just don't know what the rules

2522
02:01:40,130 --> 02:01:40,963
are.
Like what a judge can do and I don't 

2523
02:01:42,791 --> 02:01:43,624
know either,
but the sentencing is sending sings a 

2524
02:01:45,771 --> 02:01:46,604
weird thing.
They have minimums were certain things 

2525
02:01:47,751 --> 02:01:50,840
like murder and armed robbery crimes.
there's probably,

2526
02:01:50,900 --> 02:01:53,870
there's got to be parameters for.
They're always like,

2527
02:01:53,900 --> 02:01:54,733
oh,
this judge particularly is lenient on 

2528
02:01:56,390 --> 02:01:57,890
this and that matter.
Like you,

2529
02:01:57,910 --> 02:02:00,800
you almost want to choose your judge and
you choose your jurors.

2530
02:02:01,250 --> 02:02:03,380
The attorneys do based on.
Okay,

2531
02:02:03,381 --> 02:02:04,214
so I didn't really go to law school for 
two weeks and we did learn about jury 

2532
02:02:06,681 --> 02:02:09,170
selection and the key is you do want to 
get,

2533
02:02:09,320 --> 02:02:12,800
and this is horrible,
but usually like the dumbest people,

2534
02:02:12,830 --> 02:02:14,900
like you want to have people that are 
really,

2535
02:02:15,400 --> 02:02:16,233
you know,
I'm easily persuaded to whatever your 

2536
02:02:18,531 --> 02:02:23,531
cause and a judge to that is favorable 
for liberal if they're whatever,

2537
02:02:24,710 --> 02:02:27,690
you know,
you could guess based on their,

2538
02:02:28,460 --> 02:02:29,750
the precedence.
Yeah,

2539
02:02:30,380 --> 02:02:31,460
man.
Yeah.

2540
02:02:32,330 --> 02:02:35,270
It's very fluid.
Geez,

2541
02:02:35,300 --> 02:02:36,410
tom.
She's doing all right.

2542
02:02:36,411 --> 02:02:40,010
I mean freaking us out so quick.
A lot of water.

2543
02:02:40,420 --> 02:02:41,360
No,
no you don't.

2544
02:02:41,361 --> 02:02:43,070
That's the first time you've cracked it 
open.

2545
02:02:43,071 --> 02:02:47,750
What are you guys fighting?
I hydrate a lot more than he does.

2546
02:02:47,840 --> 02:02:49,220
Oh,
is this an issue?

2547
02:02:50,080 --> 02:02:52,340
It's not close.
You hydrate more than.

2548
02:02:52,341 --> 02:02:55,310
Of course I've been hydrating this whole
time.

2549
02:02:55,370 --> 02:02:56,250
Interesting.
Uh,

2550
02:02:56,390 --> 02:03:00,800
but he has that drink too.
That's not this hydration.

2551
02:03:00,801 --> 02:03:02,930
Much smaller.
Smaller being.

2552
02:03:02,931 --> 02:03:06,980
I weigh like a fraction of when he was 
very tiny and petite.

2553
02:03:09,130 --> 02:03:10,740
Oh geez.
Look at my uh,

2554
02:03:11,030 --> 02:03:12,320
moniker,
dad mouth,

2555
02:03:12,680 --> 02:03:15,290
but look at water.
Use the water champion.

2556
02:03:15,320 --> 02:03:20,320
Is that what you tell people that I'm 
clearly the water champion.

2557
02:03:21,351 --> 02:03:23,050
We decided this.
I got,

2558
02:03:23,550 --> 02:03:26,690
I got to do a full new show.
A lot of times you have to go.

2559
02:03:26,930 --> 02:03:29,380
You're doing like eight minutes.
I did the entire blog.

2560
02:03:29,390 --> 02:03:31,720
I did the weather and everything.
All his dj dad mouth.

2561
02:03:31,721 --> 02:03:33,350
Every what?
What city was this in?

2562
02:03:33,590 --> 02:03:36,740
Des moines.
Really happy were there.

2563
02:03:36,770 --> 02:03:38,040
They were just,
oh my god.

2564
02:03:38,300 --> 02:03:39,730
What are you doing in des moines?
I was,

2565
02:03:39,830 --> 02:03:41,360
I was there.
I did two nights.

2566
02:03:41,361 --> 02:03:43,160
Just said the funny bone.
Is it fun?

2567
02:03:43,480 --> 02:03:44,540
Yeah.
I had a really good time.

2568
02:03:44,870 --> 02:03:45,703
Really good time.
Did you come up with this dj dad mouth 

2569
02:03:47,601 --> 02:03:49,700
thing?
Just like it was at a specific,

2570
02:03:49,730 --> 02:03:50,563
like,
like a plan or did you do it like for 

2571
02:03:52,580 --> 02:03:53,180
fun?

2572
02:03:53,180 --> 02:03:54,740
For fun?
Totally for fun.

2573
02:03:54,741 --> 02:03:55,574
Just to shoot one day and then we just 
tell joe the whole story when I was 

2574
02:04:00,111 --> 02:04:00,944
eight months pregnant and he's like,
I'm going to buy like a ton of dj 

2575
02:04:04,351 --> 02:04:05,360
equipment.
I'm like,

2576
02:04:05,361 --> 02:04:06,710
wait,
what are you doing?

2577
02:04:07,010 --> 02:04:08,270
He's like,
I'm buy like $10,000

2578
02:04:08,271 --> 02:04:09,590
where the shit in our house,
and I was like,

2579
02:04:09,630 --> 02:04:10,463
all right,
this is your.

2580
02:04:10,520 --> 02:04:13,880
I clearly knew this is his last hurrah 
as a free person,

2581
02:04:14,240 --> 02:04:15,073
so I try not to give them too much 
static and then sure enough all was 

2582
02:04:17,721 --> 02:04:20,870
deejaying stuff shows up.
NoT 10 grand.

2583
02:04:21,570 --> 02:04:26,570
You got decks and fucking lights and 
lasers and peter.

2584
02:04:28,940 --> 02:04:30,350
Yeah,
he's got a lot.

2585
02:04:30,390 --> 02:04:31,130
He's,
well,

2586
02:04:31,130 --> 02:04:32,510
he's a real dj.
He does.

2587
02:04:32,780 --> 02:04:34,520
He goes to clubs.
You can do it.

2588
02:04:35,320 --> 02:04:36,410
He doesn't know.
He does.

2589
02:04:36,411 --> 02:04:38,310
Yes he does.
Yes.

2590
02:04:38,610 --> 02:04:41,460
What's her face?
Because I was like,

2591
02:04:41,820 --> 02:04:45,570
I'll get good enough at this to do after
parties after my shows.

2592
02:04:46,100 --> 02:04:48,210
Were you serious?
I was half serious.

2593
02:04:48,240 --> 02:04:49,590
Yeah,
because I was like,

2594
02:04:49,591 --> 02:04:50,191
you know whaT,
like,

2595
02:04:50,191 --> 02:04:51,090
because I,
you know,

2596
02:04:51,091 --> 02:04:51,660
I,
I've,

2597
02:04:51,660 --> 02:04:54,030
I love hip hop.
I've always grown up and I always wanted

2598
02:04:54,031 --> 02:04:55,650
to do it.
So I got the,

2599
02:04:55,651 --> 02:04:56,370
I got like,
you know,

2600
02:04:56,370 --> 02:04:57,170
internet.
I'm not,

2601
02:04:57,170 --> 02:04:58,820
not tent that.
Not even 5,000,

2602
02:04:58,821 --> 02:04:59,850
like,
not even close to that.

2603
02:05:00,090 --> 02:05:03,510
I just bought turntables and got her 
jacket.

2604
02:05:03,590 --> 02:05:05,070
It's gold chains.
No,

2605
02:05:05,071 --> 02:05:06,810
but come on.
That shit was just silly to get,

2606
02:05:06,840 --> 02:05:07,673
you know,
you were a dj today and you were trying 

2607
02:05:09,361 --> 02:05:10,194
to spend turntables,
don't you think people would be asking 

2608
02:05:11,281 --> 02:05:12,114
to take selfies in the middle of it and 
it would fuck up your flow if I was 

2609
02:05:15,721 --> 02:05:17,670
deejaying and if you were like doing an 
after party,

2610
02:05:17,671 --> 02:05:19,260
people have tried to take selfies with 
you.

2611
02:05:21,360 --> 02:05:25,560
I'm in the middle.
I'd be up there on facebook.

2612
02:05:26,150 --> 02:05:27,540
You've probably right?
Yeah,

2613
02:05:27,600 --> 02:05:31,890
for sure.
They would have to be honest,

2614
02:05:31,891 --> 02:05:34,800
who really gave me the idea idea where I
was like,

2615
02:05:34,830 --> 02:05:35,663
oh,
like this is actually possible was 

2616
02:05:37,621 --> 02:05:38,454
hannibal,
because I was in cleveland earlier this 

2617
02:05:40,860 --> 02:05:45,060
year and I saw him tweet that he was in 
cleveland doing a pop up show.

2618
02:05:45,420 --> 02:05:46,253
Right.
He just tweeted out and doing like a 

2619
02:05:47,760 --> 02:05:49,770
whatever,
like a rock club pop up show.

2620
02:05:50,040 --> 02:05:52,440
No advanced notice.
So I texted him.

2621
02:05:53,040 --> 02:05:53,873
I was like,
I'm over at hilaritY that great club in 

2622
02:05:56,401 --> 02:05:57,810
cleveland.
Uh,

2623
02:05:57,990 --> 02:05:59,100
when is your show?
He said,

2624
02:05:59,101 --> 02:05:59,581
like,
nine.

2625
02:05:59,581 --> 02:06:00,240
I go,
mine's at eight.

2626
02:06:00,240 --> 02:06:02,040
You want to do a guest spot?
And he goes,

2627
02:06:02,041 --> 02:06:04,920
yeah.
So then afterwards he had an after party

2628
02:06:05,400 --> 02:06:06,780
at the uh,
and I,

2629
02:06:06,800 --> 02:06:09,350
and that's me basically geeking out on 
the decks.

2630
02:06:10,650 --> 02:06:11,370
Yeah.
So,

2631
02:06:11,370 --> 02:06:12,203
and then tony trim,
which is a dj that travels with him was 

2632
02:06:15,571 --> 02:06:15,841
like,
oh,

2633
02:06:15,841 --> 02:06:18,150
did you can just get this and you can 
just buy this stuff.

2634
02:06:18,151 --> 02:06:18,750
And,
and,

2635
02:06:18,750 --> 02:06:21,360
and that's what really got me to do it 
was cro one up,

2636
02:06:21,420 --> 02:06:26,420
let's look at that white guy dance,
move that move.

2637
02:06:28,261 --> 02:06:30,300
you're doing there.
You're doing thiS.

2638
02:06:32,680 --> 02:06:33,513
Yeah,
that's true.

2639
02:06:34,300 --> 02:06:39,300
That's what really geeked me out was the
dj dad math came because he was becoming

2640
02:06:40,681 --> 02:06:45,681
a father at the time and was a dad and 
then it kind of morphed into dj dan.

2641
02:06:48,150 --> 02:06:49,500
That's true.
All that's true.

2642
02:06:49,501 --> 02:06:52,860
But taking it onto morning news was like
a one time goof.

2643
02:06:53,100 --> 02:06:53,933
Funny.
That was so fun and I was like all the 

2644
02:06:55,711 --> 02:06:56,610
time,
you know.

2645
02:06:56,820 --> 02:06:57,653
So when you went on as a onetime goof,
did you have a plan or did you just 

2646
02:07:01,500 --> 02:07:02,610
really.
What'd you do?

2647
02:07:03,030 --> 02:07:07,280
I was just like,
the fun thing was to go was because I,

2648
02:07:07,290 --> 02:07:08,600
the thing that I hate the most when you 
do that,

2649
02:07:08,670 --> 02:07:10,560
they're like,
what can audiences expect this weekend?

2650
02:07:10,890 --> 02:07:11,720
They always say that,
oh,

2651
02:07:11,720 --> 02:07:12,780
I hate that.
And I'm like,

2652
02:07:12,800 --> 02:07:14,640
oh,
fucking show jokes.

2653
02:07:14,780 --> 02:07:16,650
Um,
what do you talk about?

2654
02:07:16,950 --> 02:07:17,783
Yeah.
What's,

2655
02:07:17,820 --> 02:07:19,380
what's,
what's bothering you right now?

2656
02:07:19,380 --> 02:07:20,213
Tom?
Yeah,

2657
02:07:20,280 --> 02:07:21,113
that's the setup.
Tell What's going on in your life and 

2658
02:07:22,141 --> 02:07:23,610
they think you're going to like.
And then they go,

2659
02:07:23,611 --> 02:07:25,680
just do whatever you want.
Like just have fun with it.

2660
02:07:26,040 --> 02:07:27,840
So when they do that,
I was just like,

2661
02:07:28,300 --> 02:07:30,270
it's not really,
I don't really give a fuck about comedy.

2662
02:07:30,570 --> 02:07:31,940
And then they're like,
what?

2663
02:07:32,500 --> 02:07:33,870
I'm like,
it's about the after party,

2664
02:07:33,900 --> 02:07:34,733
you know,
I'm going to be deejaying here just to 

2665
02:07:36,821 --> 02:07:40,420
goof off because it was fun to have 
around and be like,

2666
02:07:40,720 --> 02:07:42,640
all right,
you are at the funny bone.

2667
02:07:42,641 --> 02:07:43,181
Right?
I'm like,

2668
02:07:43,181 --> 02:07:46,900
I mean for a minute,
I don't even really care about it.

2669
02:07:46,901 --> 02:07:49,120
The funny bone.
And then you have the funny bone sitting

2670
02:07:49,121 --> 02:07:52,310
right there off camera.
Like who cares?

2671
02:07:52,480 --> 02:07:53,313
Like the best part is when he sets up 
like the really cheesy anchors to ask 

2672
02:07:57,521 --> 02:08:00,360
him stupid questions.
Like,

2673
02:08:00,400 --> 02:08:00,821
did you,
oh,

2674
02:08:00,821 --> 02:08:02,530
you had someone do the bird is fat 
thing.

2675
02:08:02,810 --> 02:08:06,100
That was the best one because you know,
if you ever add sometimes when you go,

2676
02:08:06,460 --> 02:08:07,293
hey,
um,

2677
02:08:07,420 --> 02:08:09,790
you know,
asked me about farts or something,

2678
02:08:10,210 --> 02:08:11,200
they'll be like,
like,

2679
02:08:11,310 --> 02:08:13,120
so they,
they know not to.

2680
02:08:13,850 --> 02:08:14,683
They check themselves on asking 
something provocative or that's not 100 

2681
02:08:18,371 --> 02:08:21,190
percent pg.
So I didn't know how it go,

2682
02:08:21,191 --> 02:08:22,030
but I go,
oh,

2683
02:08:22,120 --> 02:08:23,290
ask me what bird.
So fat.

2684
02:08:23,560 --> 02:08:24,610
And the lady goes,
okay,

2685
02:08:25,180 --> 02:08:28,960
and then so we just are in the middle of
this interview.

2686
02:08:31,390 --> 02:08:32,260
She goes,
white bird,

2687
02:08:32,261 --> 02:08:34,180
so fat.
Then I was asked a good question and I'm

2688
02:08:34,200 --> 02:08:35,650
like,
I just rolled with it,

2689
02:08:35,651 --> 02:08:37,150
you know,
and then it grew.

2690
02:08:37,151 --> 02:08:41,180
And then a hot dog eating champion,
a guy that was in scotland,

2691
02:08:41,200 --> 02:08:43,390
she placed tinny place.
Yeah.

2692
02:08:43,391 --> 02:08:46,570
He's like one of the.
He was like a super competitive eater,

2693
02:08:46,630 --> 02:08:51,630
like a kobiashi dude.
This guy was probably the audio on this.

2694
02:08:52,450 --> 02:08:53,500
It's incredible

2695
02:08:53,790 --> 02:08:57,990
life changing stuff dropped about 100 
pounds in eight months.

2696
02:08:58,170 --> 02:09:01,350
He dropped 100 pounds my cheat day for 
the year,

2697
02:09:02,650 --> 02:09:06,870
but prepping just this amazing water to 
giant inspiration.

2698
02:09:06,871 --> 02:09:09,990
So first my wife,
it's our second anniversary today,

2699
02:09:10,060 --> 02:09:12,400
so I want to say hi to her.
And um,

2700
02:09:12,810 --> 02:09:14,970
there's a comedian I love.
He's a big,

2701
02:09:14,971 --> 02:09:16,170
giant,
fat guy just like me.

2702
02:09:16,171 --> 02:09:17,004
Bert chrysler,

2703
02:09:20,370 --> 02:09:23,840
he's still way bigger than I am.
Maybe I can inspire him.

2704
02:09:24,020 --> 02:09:26,720
There you go.
Now are is funny.

2705
02:09:26,750 --> 02:09:27,583
This is why it's funny.
Tom and bert had been doing this thing 

2706
02:09:29,931 --> 02:09:30,764
for a fucking year.
Now tom will write to the hashtag burn 

2707
02:09:34,190 --> 02:09:35,023
fat and then bert will right thomas fat.
And then they'll argue they make videos 

2708
02:09:38,661 --> 02:09:40,790
with their shirts off,
arguing who's fatter.

2709
02:09:40,930 --> 02:09:41,820
Yeah,
it was fun.

2710
02:09:41,870 --> 02:09:42,740
It's actually,
you know,

2711
02:09:43,190 --> 02:09:46,630
it's died down a lot,
but like the fact that that guy did,

2712
02:09:46,650 --> 02:09:49,190
he did it on his own,
which is a picture of you up.

2713
02:09:49,280 --> 02:09:49,971
Yeah.
I see.

2714
02:09:49,971 --> 02:09:50,804
Hashtag burn as fast talk about you.
If I tweet about you hashtag birds that 

2715
02:09:55,540 --> 02:09:58,580
took off.
We didn't,

2716
02:09:58,610 --> 02:10:00,080
like we talked about on your mom's 
house,

2717
02:10:00,081 --> 02:10:02,330
but we never thought we'd do all kinds 
of silly stuff,

2718
02:10:02,331 --> 02:10:04,790
but this one really resonated with the 
audience.

2719
02:10:05,120 --> 02:10:07,350
Why did that one really resonate?
Um,

2720
02:10:07,580 --> 02:10:08,540
you know what?
There was,

2721
02:10:08,600 --> 02:10:11,510
there was great theories about this and 
I think it was this.

2722
02:10:11,511 --> 02:10:14,960
I think matt full trump pointed out to 
me the full charge said,

2723
02:10:15,040 --> 02:10:16,670
um,
you gave them the formula,

2724
02:10:17,210 --> 02:10:20,660
you gave audiences a joke formula.
Here's a person.

2725
02:10:21,260 --> 02:10:23,030
It's a fat joke.
Go,

2726
02:10:23,050 --> 02:10:23,883
go ahead.
And I think that was what was fun for 

2727
02:10:25,281 --> 02:10:29,780
people to jump in on something that it's
all,

2728
02:10:29,781 --> 02:10:32,780
like the formula is there to pick a 
side.

2729
02:10:33,580 --> 02:10:34,040
That's the

2730
02:10:34,040 --> 02:10:35,460
competitive nature of it.
Yeah.

2731
02:10:37,500 --> 02:10:38,333
Yeah.
And they know that you guys really are 

2732
02:10:39,771 --> 02:10:41,240
good friends.
Some did,

2733
02:10:41,300 --> 02:10:43,160
some did not.
I would say most,

2734
02:10:43,190 --> 02:10:44,780
most people did.
Most people did.

2735
02:10:44,810 --> 02:10:46,550
Some people get mad.
Oh yeah.

2736
02:10:46,551 --> 02:10:50,870
Some people were like really fucking 
really harsh and really like,

2737
02:10:50,871 --> 02:10:51,704
fuck,
I've always fucking hated burgs a piece 

2738
02:10:52,971 --> 02:10:53,571
of like,
you're like,

2739
02:10:53,571 --> 02:10:55,310
whoa,
like shit like that.

2740
02:10:55,520 --> 02:10:58,310
But it wasn't the majority.
Some people were like that though.

2741
02:10:58,350 --> 02:10:59,660
Yeah.
Same thing to me.

2742
02:10:59,710 --> 02:11:01,440
I'll tape some people were like,
you know,

2743
02:11:02,040 --> 02:11:03,860
it's one of my theories about this trump
thing.

2744
02:11:04,670 --> 02:11:09,410
I think people just pick a fucking side 
and that side represents the battle.

2745
02:11:09,480 --> 02:11:11,300
Yeah.
And it doesn't have to make any sense,

2746
02:11:11,360 --> 02:11:12,320
right?
If you like,

2747
02:11:12,920 --> 02:11:15,140
whatever fact you bring about like,
I don't care.

2748
02:11:15,320 --> 02:11:18,110
One of the things that I like,
if I post something about hillary,

2749
02:11:18,170 --> 02:11:21,200
like some,
I get so many people just get so fucking

2750
02:11:21,201 --> 02:11:21,500
upset.

2751
02:11:21,500 --> 02:11:22,070
I'm like,
look,

2752
02:11:22,070 --> 02:11:24,200
it doesn't take away from like one guy 
was saying that,

2753
02:11:24,201 --> 02:11:25,730
um,
that uh,

2754
02:11:25,760 --> 02:11:26,400
the,
uh,

2755
02:11:26,400 --> 02:11:28,340
the,
there's a bunch of different ones,

2756
02:11:28,341 --> 02:11:30,950
but there was one recently.
I'm a wiki leaks,

2757
02:11:30,951 --> 02:11:33,080
one that came out today.
We're a wiki.

2758
02:11:33,081 --> 02:11:35,150
Leaks is saying that she,
uh,

2759
02:11:35,180 --> 02:11:38,870
she said she asked about julian assange 
whether they could just drone this guy.

2760
02:11:39,850 --> 02:11:41,720
She's like,
which is kind of funny.

2761
02:11:41,950 --> 02:11:45,770
Like I get it.
She's saying he's just thumbing his nose

2762
02:11:45,771 --> 02:11:46,640
up in America.
I can't,

2763
02:11:46,641 --> 02:11:49,220
we just drone this guy.
Who knows where she really centered.

2764
02:11:49,240 --> 02:11:49,850
Right,
right.

2765
02:11:49,850 --> 02:11:52,820
But the problem is if,
if somebody tweets it,

2766
02:11:52,850 --> 02:11:54,380
the people that support hillary don't 
go,

2767
02:11:54,381 --> 02:11:55,580
whoa,
that's kind of interesting.

2768
02:11:55,700 --> 02:11:56,420
They go,
oh,

2769
02:11:56,420 --> 02:11:58,250
you fucking.
You think that you really mean that.

2770
02:11:58,310 --> 02:11:59,540
Where's your.
Where's your proof?

2771
02:11:59,541 --> 02:12:00,374
Like we're like,
all of a sudden they're defending their 

2772
02:12:01,641 --> 02:12:02,474
side.
They're defending that person like 

2773
02:12:03,420 --> 02:12:04,253
they're so emotionally invested in her 
winning over trump that instead of 

2774
02:12:07,941 --> 02:12:08,780
going,
whoa,

2775
02:12:08,830 --> 02:12:09,663
did she really say that?

2776
02:12:09,680 --> 02:12:10,513
Right?
Let's check the story out or in as a 

2777
02:12:12,321 --> 02:12:14,810
human being just going,
what do you think she meant?

2778
02:12:14,811 --> 02:12:17,900
Do you think is a joke or crazy,
or do you think this is what they really

2779
02:12:17,901 --> 02:12:18,734
do?
And then it starts.

2780
02:12:18,740 --> 02:12:19,573
You start thinking about some of the 
things that have taken place like that 

2781
02:12:21,021 --> 02:12:25,130
fucking kid who leaked the emails to the
dnc and wound up getting shot at 4:00

2782
02:12:25,131 --> 02:12:26,780
in the morning and the back in front of 
his house.

2783
02:12:27,170 --> 02:12:28,010
You know that story,
right?

2784
02:12:28,100 --> 02:12:30,250
I don't know.
No,

2785
02:12:30,390 --> 02:12:31,600
no.
This is a kid who,

2786
02:12:31,670 --> 02:12:32,570
4:00
in the morning,

2787
02:12:32,571 --> 02:12:33,404
this is a guy who leaked the emails that
showed that they collaborated to get 

2788
02:12:36,620 --> 02:12:37,453
hillary elected over.
Bernie sanders makes sure that she got 

2789
02:12:39,681 --> 02:12:40,730
the nomination.
I mean,

2790
02:12:40,790 --> 02:12:43,850
they literally distorted they distorted 
democracy,

2791
02:12:44,060 --> 02:12:44,893
like the democratic national campaign 
was working to try to get hillary 

2792
02:12:49,821 --> 02:12:53,870
elected over him because bernie sanders 
is not really a democrat.

2793
02:12:54,110 --> 02:12:56,390
He's like more of an independent,
you know,

2794
02:12:56,391 --> 02:12:57,224
and like he doesn't play like party line
games and they had decided pretty early 

2795
02:13:00,801 --> 02:13:04,310
on they were going to support her.
So it's not like the democratic national

2796
02:13:04,311 --> 02:13:07,370
committee has just,
just being completely objective and just

2797
02:13:07,371 --> 02:13:09,590
doing their best.
He was murdered,

2798
02:13:10,310 --> 02:13:14,610
hence murdered dc staffer was email 
leaker offers $20,000

2799
02:13:14,611 --> 02:13:16,230
reward for info.
Yeah.

2800
02:13:17,420 --> 02:13:18,920
Yeah.
This is a crazy story.

2801
02:13:19,520 --> 02:13:23,900
It's a crazy story.
I mean if that is what happened and they

2802
02:13:23,901 --> 02:13:27,260
decided to have someone kill that kid,
that kid is the one that leaked that.

2803
02:13:27,350 --> 02:13:28,670
Exactly.
But here's the thing,

2804
02:13:28,730 --> 02:13:31,010
it worked.
It not only he's that he's,

2805
02:13:31,350 --> 02:13:32,183
but no one's talking about it anymore.
It's just one of those things you just 

2806
02:13:34,081 --> 02:13:35,640
kind of went away.
I don't know what happened.

2807
02:13:35,641 --> 02:13:36,474
I mean,
he might have just been kiLled in some 

2808
02:13:36,991 --> 02:13:40,320
random act of violence because he was in
a bad place at the wrong time,

2809
02:13:41,010 --> 02:13:41,843
or some of them have fucking killed him 
like that might've happened to if he 

2810
02:13:46,801 --> 02:13:50,250
really did leak.
Those emails like that is nuts.

2811
02:13:51,270 --> 02:13:53,970
It's a movie a movie.
Sure is,

2812
02:13:54,230 --> 02:13:57,300
and in this case,
create crazy chaotic election.

2813
02:13:57,600 --> 02:13:58,433
Nobody has any time for that.
There's too many other things you have 

2814
02:13:59,611 --> 02:14:00,444
to be thinking about is a million 
different things going on at the same 

2815
02:14:02,491 --> 02:14:03,324
time.

2816
02:14:04,380 --> 02:14:05,213
Yeah.
It really makes you like those picking 

2817
02:14:06,121 --> 02:14:08,640
sides.
Things to always makes you realize.

2818
02:14:08,641 --> 02:14:12,870
I think that that elections are decided 
by either side.

2819
02:14:12,871 --> 02:14:15,300
It really is decided by that person that
can be swayed.

2820
02:14:15,570 --> 02:14:17,340
It's such a small,
weird thing.

2821
02:14:17,341 --> 02:14:19,350
you know,
you're never going to sway the left.

2822
02:14:19,410 --> 02:14:22,800
The far left or the far right.
It's all about the person who was like,

2823
02:14:23,290 --> 02:14:25,650
who is the undecided?
Like are you really?

2824
02:14:25,950 --> 02:14:28,350
Those are two polar,
in my opinion,

2825
02:14:28,351 --> 02:14:30,300
opposite people,
trump and hillary.

2826
02:14:30,301 --> 02:14:31,134
It's like,
how are you on the fence if they're 

2827
02:14:33,440 --> 02:14:34,890
don't understand the way they're 
thinking.

2828
02:14:35,040 --> 02:14:36,690
They're so polar.
It's a joke,

2829
02:14:37,820 --> 02:14:42,820
it's a cartoon they have male and 
feminine,

2830
02:14:43,291 --> 02:14:44,124
nor the noise of all the news stuff and 
the conversations you really got to be 

2831
02:14:48,481 --> 02:14:50,550
like,
what's the policy on this?

2832
02:14:50,580 --> 02:14:53,550
And then I guess some people are,
are actually caught up,

2833
02:14:54,130 --> 02:14:55,950
you know,
thinking like an actual,

2834
02:14:56,580 --> 02:14:58,830
like the drama of it all and the 
personality,

2835
02:14:58,831 --> 02:14:59,900
the drama.
If you're,

2836
02:14:59,910 --> 02:15:02,400
if you're one of those people that's 
actually going back and forth,

2837
02:15:03,150 --> 02:15:05,970
right.
You have just eat neither or

2838
02:15:06,220 --> 02:15:07,053
our ideal.
And anybody who pretends that either or 

2839
02:15:09,581 --> 02:15:11,860
are our ideal is crazy.
Yeah.

2840
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:12,833
No.
So I get you want to stop trump because 

2841
02:15:15,341 --> 02:15:17,080
you think he represents everything 
that's wrong in the world.

2842
02:15:17,440 --> 02:15:18,700
Well,
to some people,

2843
02:15:18,760 --> 02:15:21,070
hillary represents everything that's 
wrong in politics.

2844
02:15:21,440 --> 02:15:22,760
Some people have a problem with that 
too,

2845
02:15:22,770 --> 02:15:26,280
right?
It's just the whole thing is,

2846
02:15:26,470 --> 02:15:27,303
it's just,
it's a weird sort of a social studY as 

2847
02:15:30,701 --> 02:15:35,410
much as it is an election year.
You're watching this team thing play out

2848
02:15:35,560 --> 02:15:36,940
is very strange way.
Yeah.

2849
02:15:37,720 --> 02:15:38,900
Yeah.
Oh,

2850
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:40,670
I don't know.
I,

2851
02:15:40,670 --> 02:15:41,800
I,
I don't know either.

2852
02:15:42,520 --> 02:15:44,320
And I mean there are,
who do you think's gonna win.

2853
02:15:45,010 --> 02:15:45,640
that's the thing.

2854
02:15:45,640 --> 02:15:46,451
See,
that's the thing,

2855
02:15:46,451 --> 02:15:47,480
it's like,
who do you think's gonna win?

2856
02:15:47,530 --> 02:15:48,850
I don't know.
I'm thinking.

2857
02:15:49,150 --> 02:15:53,380
I think people will pick a side,
they'll pick a side,

2858
02:15:53,410 --> 02:15:54,243
whether it's democrat or republican,
they'll pick aside at some point in 

2859
02:15:57,281 --> 02:15:58,114
their life and then just start accepting
stuff to stay on the team going with 

2860
02:16:02,321 --> 02:16:07,321
stuff that goes that way and you know,
I mean there's like some ridiculous like

2861
02:16:07,750 --> 02:16:08,583
super ultra sensitive leftwing stuff 
that I think is preposterous and then 

2862
02:16:11,921 --> 02:16:13,720
there's some ridiculous,
right?

2863
02:16:13,750 --> 02:16:14,583
We're super conservative,
ultra religious stuff that I think is 

2864
02:16:16,781 --> 02:16:19,870
preposterous and you could only be one 
or the other.

2865
02:16:19,900 --> 02:16:20,733
Like if you're a republican,
you have to believe in god and you have 

2866
02:16:22,751 --> 02:16:25,600
to be conservative and you have to 
right.

2867
02:16:26,050 --> 02:16:26,883
The party.
What the party is now is completely 

2868
02:16:28,181 --> 02:16:32,050
different than what it was the eighties 
when reagan was chillin and everyone was

2869
02:16:32,051 --> 02:16:32,884
happy.
The eighties is when they courted the 

2870
02:16:34,841 --> 02:16:36,670
religious right.
That's how they made it.

2871
02:16:36,671 --> 02:16:40,210
The religious right in the eighties.
Those religious people are a big part of

2872
02:16:40,211 --> 02:16:41,044
the reason why reagan got elected in the
first place because they organize those 

2873
02:16:43,721 --> 02:16:44,554
church people organized like they all 
supported him because you know he was 

2874
02:16:47,531 --> 02:16:48,364
supporting christian values.
There was much more of a separation of 

2875
02:16:50,891 --> 02:16:53,950
church and state in the earLier years of
the government.

2876
02:16:54,400 --> 02:16:55,211
Yeah.
I feel well,

2877
02:16:55,211 --> 02:16:59,410
I feel like thIs year's election is in 
our lifetime or my lifetime is the most.

2878
02:17:00,010 --> 02:17:05,010
Like the votes are based on the.
The hatred of the other candIdate,

2879
02:17:06,011 --> 02:17:09,340
more so than supporting the candidate in
some ways,

2880
02:17:09,341 --> 02:17:11,800
but some peopLe love trumP.
They fucking love a man.

2881
02:17:11,860 --> 02:17:13,410
They love the idea thAt this guy is 
gonna.

2882
02:17:13,430 --> 02:17:17,080
Come in and just shake it up,
shake it up,

2883
02:17:17,590 --> 02:17:22,590
shake it up with all kinds of stupid.
That's the dumbest fucking guy.

2884
02:17:23,020 --> 02:17:25,960
It's absurd.
That debate the other night was insane.

2885
02:17:26,340 --> 02:17:29,140
I saw people that I like who said that 
he won the debate,

2886
02:17:29,380 --> 02:17:32,680
so yeah,
dave rubin said it.

2887
02:17:33,840 --> 02:17:36,860
Dave ruben said he thinks that he thinks
that overall trump Won.

2888
02:17:37,480 --> 02:17:40,930
Maybe the beginning was just brutal.
I missed the beginning.

2889
02:17:40,980 --> 02:17:42,160
Yeah.
Did you see the beginning?

2890
02:17:42,190 --> 02:17:43,080
No,
not either.

2891
02:17:43,170 --> 02:17:44,003
No,
I only saw the end when he was just 

2892
02:17:44,501 --> 02:17:45,334
stumbling.
Said he has a winning temperament and 

2893
02:17:47,800 --> 02:17:48,633
she found him.
She's called the winning temperament 

2894
02:17:50,561 --> 02:17:51,394
thing,
was such a like a childish temper 

2895
02:17:53,231 --> 02:17:54,064
tantrum.
While it's so weird because he turns it 

2896
02:17:56,411 --> 02:17:57,244
around like the question was,
did you say that hillary doesn't have 

2897
02:18:00,881 --> 02:18:03,850
the right look to be president,
and he was the look,

2898
02:18:04,120 --> 02:18:08,080
the stamina.
She doesn't have a winning temperament.

2899
02:18:08,290 --> 02:18:11,980
I have a winning temperament.
He turns it around on himself Because he

2900
02:18:11,981 --> 02:18:14,960
knows that the big knock,
so he's getting defensive that that was,

2901
02:18:15,040 --> 02:18:16,210
that was,
that was bait,

2902
02:18:16,240 --> 02:18:19,450
but that he couldn't ignore because the 
big knock had been.

2903
02:18:19,800 --> 02:18:21,280
Well,
one of the bIg knocks was like,

2904
02:18:21,310 --> 02:18:22,143
well,
you don't have the temperament because 

2905
02:18:22,841 --> 02:18:24,580
he's.
He's very thin skinned.

2906
02:18:24,610 --> 02:18:26,290
Right?
Like anybody tweet something,

2907
02:18:26,310 --> 02:18:27,490
adam,
he fights,

2908
02:18:27,520 --> 02:18:28,001
you know,
you guys,

2909
02:18:28,001 --> 02:18:30,160
all the insults.
That's because his temperament,

2910
02:18:30,580 --> 02:18:33,190
that doesn't seem presidential,
but he's a winning temperament.

2911
02:18:33,220 --> 02:18:34,053
That's the spin spin,
but it just shows how much he absorbed 

2912
02:18:38,441 --> 02:18:40,240
all that stuff and was defensive about 
it.

2913
02:18:40,270 --> 02:18:41,120
Yeah,
yeah.

2914
02:18:41,130 --> 02:18:42,220
No,
it was very defensive.

2915
02:18:42,410 --> 02:18:44,770
Also the presidential,
yet he gets very,

2916
02:18:45,020 --> 02:18:46,480
like,
doesn't really get away,

2917
02:18:46,481 --> 02:18:50,710
but it's one of those things that his 
supporters ignore was how often,

2918
02:18:50,760 --> 02:18:52,420
you know,
he just goes like bronc,

2919
02:18:52,421 --> 02:18:53,410
like he was wrong.

2920
02:18:53,820 --> 02:18:56,740
That's not never said that.
And it's all stuff that he did say.

2921
02:18:56,790 --> 02:18:57,910
Yeah.
And they just go like,

2922
02:18:57,911 --> 02:19:02,380
well who cares?
You just some part of the tax thing came

2923
02:19:02,381 --> 02:19:07,381
out that he put how much money?
Nine hundred and $15,000,000

2924
02:19:07,931 --> 02:19:08,764
in losses.
So they didn't have to pay taxes for a 

2925
02:19:10,361 --> 02:19:12,040
long time.
Eighteen years,

2926
02:19:12,280 --> 02:19:14,020
18 years,
no taxes really.

2927
02:19:14,180 --> 02:19:16,330
Well,
he said that he basically,

2928
02:19:16,720 --> 02:19:17,530
it's legal.
What you,

2929
02:19:17,530 --> 02:19:18,363
what they're saying might be the reason 
why he hasn't wanted to release his tax 

2930
02:19:22,181 --> 02:19:27,181
returns is that that level of loss would
allow him to not taxes on

2931
02:19:28,160 --> 02:19:32,240
essentially $50 million in income.
No federal taxes for about 20 years.

2932
02:19:34,860 --> 02:19:35,481
But they're saying,
you know,

2933
02:19:35,481 --> 02:19:39,590
that's why the reluctance to probably 
cause once that's out there,

2934
02:19:39,620 --> 02:19:42,230
even though you didn't break a law,
that's,

2935
02:19:42,280 --> 02:19:43,113
you know.
Well it also crushes the illusion that 

2936
02:19:45,381 --> 02:19:47,840
he's a successful businessman of course 
course.

2937
02:19:47,990 --> 02:19:50,660
Yeah.
That you don't lose $950,

2938
02:19:50,661 --> 02:19:53,510
million dollars or whatever it was.
If you're doing great.

2939
02:19:53,690 --> 02:19:55,040
Yeah,
that's just a fact.

2940
02:19:55,070 --> 02:19:57,020
He's filed bankruptcy,
personal bankruptcy,

2941
02:19:57,021 --> 02:19:58,940
but a couple of times.
A few times.

2942
02:19:58,941 --> 02:19:59,774
Yeah,
but it was weird when he was talking on 

2943
02:20:00,831 --> 02:20:03,540
the debate and hillary brought that up 
and he goes,

2944
02:20:03,541 --> 02:20:04,730
it's because I'm smart.
Yeah.

2945
02:20:05,600 --> 02:20:06,433
Yeah.
Like,

2946
02:20:06,740 --> 02:20:09,050
I'm smart.
I don't pay taxes because I'm smart.

2947
02:20:09,470 --> 02:20:10,840
You're running for our phone.

2948
02:20:13,290 --> 02:20:16,370
Like people who have paid taxes only 
make like 40 grand a year.

2949
02:20:16,470 --> 02:20:18,050
they're not going to want to hear that.
Right.

2950
02:20:18,560 --> 02:20:19,700
President camacho,
man.

2951
02:20:19,701 --> 02:20:20,534
We might get them to the prophecy of 
idiocracy ways that you think is going 

2952
02:20:24,771 --> 02:20:27,140
to happen next because this is what's 
fascinating to me.

2953
02:20:27,200 --> 02:20:30,140
It's like once we get through him.
Okay.

2954
02:20:30,410 --> 02:20:32,480
And whether or not he.
I don't think he can win at this point,

2955
02:20:32,481 --> 02:20:33,760
but I've been wrong before.
yeah.

2956
02:20:34,810 --> 02:20:36,920
People,
no trump fans are getting better.

2957
02:20:43,840 --> 02:20:45,600
Again,
this is the hate mail episodes.

2958
02:20:47,210 --> 02:20:47,511
It was,
hey,

2959
02:20:47,511 --> 02:20:48,344
let's say if he wins,
it's going to be very fascinating for 

2960
02:20:50,480 --> 02:20:52,050
us.
Yeah.

2961
02:20:52,770 --> 02:20:54,800
Which is going to be mad.
You know what it's going to be like.

2962
02:20:54,830 --> 02:20:56,570
It's like,
have you ever done like a um,

2963
02:20:57,530 --> 02:20:58,363
when I was living in New York,
there was an inside joke with comedians 

2964
02:21:02,030 --> 02:21:04,850
that like,
if you were all a bunch of starters,

2965
02:21:04,851 --> 02:21:07,880
you just started out and there was a 
black comic that plot,

2966
02:21:07,980 --> 02:21:09,780
that comic would always want to go on 
last.

2967
02:21:09,780 --> 02:21:10,491
LIke,
no man,

2968
02:21:10,491 --> 02:21:15,491
I was told I was supposed to headline,
but if it was a black guy with two other

2969
02:21:16,071 --> 02:21:18,170
black guys,
he always wanted to go on first.

2970
02:21:18,830 --> 02:21:19,441
Oh,
right,

2971
02:21:19,441 --> 02:21:20,274
right.
You do all the white people since my 

2972
02:21:22,011 --> 02:21:24,980
trial.
A bunch at hacky shit.

2973
02:21:24,981 --> 02:21:27,520
Like when auction auction jokes.
Yeah.

2974
02:21:27,640 --> 02:21:29,300
Yeah.
If trump becomes president,

2975
02:21:29,301 --> 02:21:32,120
we will all be that hacky urban.
Right.

2976
02:21:32,490 --> 02:21:35,810
We're just,
you'll be so much shoes.

2977
02:21:36,080 --> 02:21:36,913
You will,
you want to go on stage early because 

2978
02:21:38,270 --> 02:21:40,970
you don't want to go on after everybody 
beats the trump material in the ground.

2979
02:21:41,680 --> 02:21:44,390
It's so true.
You hair stuff,

2980
02:21:44,391 --> 02:21:49,340
your hair jokes,
all the crazy shit he's going to say,

2981
02:21:49,390 --> 02:21:51,210
yeah.
All the dumb shit he's going to do it.

2982
02:21:51,211 --> 02:21:53,240
You know,
I get the feeling that he doesn't really

2983
02:21:53,241 --> 02:21:55,580
want to be president.
I don't think so either.

2984
02:21:55,650 --> 02:21:58,520
He just likes the attention.
He's a bit of a megalomaniac.

2985
02:21:58,520 --> 02:22:01,590
he likes people talking about him,
but it's so well,

2986
02:22:01,600 --> 02:22:02,900
okay.
Let's saY he gets elected.

2987
02:22:02,960 --> 02:22:06,050
I really don't see him doing.
What's the motivation?

2988
02:22:06,110 --> 02:22:06,943
So was just going to be in the headLines
now and he wants to be referred to as 

2989
02:22:10,521 --> 02:22:11,354
mr.
President.

2990
02:22:11,390 --> 02:22:12,223
I think he's.
Do you think that once you get in 

2991
02:22:16,101 --> 02:22:17,210
though,
I mean once,

2992
02:22:17,240 --> 02:22:18,073
once he's in there,
maybe he's not going to want to let it 

2993
02:22:19,071 --> 02:22:21,230
go though.
Maybe he's going to actually try to make

2994
02:22:21,231 --> 02:22:22,370
a mark,
you know,

2995
02:22:22,371 --> 02:22:23,630
make,
do some stupid shit.

2996
02:22:23,660 --> 02:22:25,620
I feel like that his,
his favorite,

2997
02:22:25,650 --> 02:22:26,483
his perfect scenario.
I don't think you would ever want to 

2998
02:22:27,841 --> 02:22:30,090
give up running his businesses.
I think he loves it.

2999
02:22:30,360 --> 02:22:33,060
He loves his lifestyle.
I don't think he wants to be tied to the

3000
02:22:33,061 --> 02:22:33,894
white house.
I think his dream scenario is that this 

3001
02:22:36,271 --> 02:22:40,260
is a close race and then he goes like,
I basically should have won.

3002
02:22:40,590 --> 02:22:43,800
this was pretty much rigged and it 
should be another vote count.

3003
02:22:44,040 --> 02:22:45,420
Well,
he was saying that about the debate.

3004
02:22:45,450 --> 02:22:46,860
Yeah.
He was a real deal.

3005
02:22:47,660 --> 02:22:51,210
Rigged deal.
He said that about one of the.

3006
02:22:51,211 --> 02:22:52,830
I'm one of those,
uh,

3007
02:22:52,920 --> 02:22:53,753
what's it called during when there were 
more candidates in the republican 

3008
02:22:55,891 --> 02:22:56,724
primaries?
He lost one state and like the day or 

3009
02:23:00,091 --> 02:23:01,910
two after he was like,
I think I won.

3010
02:23:03,130 --> 02:23:05,210
He lost like Iowa or something.
He was mad.

3011
02:23:05,211 --> 02:23:09,660
they got one that didn't want to give it
to even do like,

3012
02:23:09,661 --> 02:23:10,494
what does he want?
It's just so amazing that he's this 

3013
02:23:12,541 --> 02:23:14,550
close.
It's so amazing and he's the nominee.

3014
02:23:15,120 --> 02:23:15,953
It's so embarrassing.
Republican's embarrassing for all of 

3015
02:23:18,371 --> 02:23:19,201
this stuff.
Columbus,

3016
02:23:19,201 --> 02:23:20,034
where this happened,
where as we were leaving a somewhat 

3017
02:23:21,600 --> 02:23:25,380
random janitor found all these black 
ballot boxes in a warehouse.

3018
02:23:26,270 --> 02:23:29,460
They're already filled out for a bunch 
of franklin county,

3019
02:23:29,610 --> 02:23:30,443
like different places in hillary 
clinton's marked and all of them was 

3020
02:23:34,650 --> 02:23:36,180
just came out yesterday and I was 
looking at.

3021
02:23:36,180 --> 02:23:36,781
I was like,
ah,

3022
02:23:36,781 --> 02:23:37,614
I don't know how,
but I'm seeing it on a bunch of news 

3023
02:23:39,031 --> 02:23:41,490
sites right now being looked into right 
now.

3024
02:23:41,790 --> 02:23:42,211
What?
What?

3025
02:23:42,211 --> 02:23:45,420
What website is this ad from?
Pamela geller.com,

3026
02:23:45,421 --> 02:23:47,280
but when I was pamela geller,
I have no idea.

3027
02:23:47,281 --> 02:23:48,990
I just clicked on the one.
The first one I saw,

3028
02:23:48,991 --> 02:23:49,824
but this was like the local nbc station 
was reported as donald trump's nice 

3029
02:23:52,860 --> 02:23:56,070
snopes reporters.
It was false,

3030
02:23:56,071 --> 02:23:59,130
but it's on a bunch of sites right now,
so it might not be true.

3031
02:23:59,370 --> 02:24:00,001
Yeah,
sorry,

3032
02:24:00,001 --> 02:24:03,180
I brought that up.
Just the damage.

3033
02:24:03,420 --> 02:24:04,500
Origin.
See there,

3034
02:24:04,530 --> 02:24:08,040
look at this be weird christian times 
newspaper and article reporting.

3035
02:24:08,041 --> 02:24:10,020
Tens of thousand.
It's fake dude.

3036
02:24:10,680 --> 02:24:11,670
How dare you.
Jamie?

3037
02:24:13,020 --> 02:24:15,330
Ballot box.
Yeah.

3038
02:24:18,750 --> 02:24:21,130
Clinton ballot boxes.
I know.

3039
02:24:21,170 --> 02:24:23,040
It's like.
It's not only that,

3040
02:24:23,280 --> 02:24:25,530
it's not.
If you look at some of them,

3041
02:24:25,531 --> 02:24:26,364
the way it was looked like there was 
photo shopped on parallel with the box 

3042
02:24:30,181 --> 02:24:30,870
itself.
Okay,

3043
02:24:30,870 --> 02:24:32,370
leT's get rid of this chair.
this is fake,

3044
02:24:34,230 --> 02:24:36,810
but it's happened.
I'm sure they've done it before.

3045
02:24:36,930 --> 02:24:38,070
You know,
I'm sure someone has written.

3046
02:24:38,340 --> 02:24:40,380
You ever see hacking democracy?
No.

3047
02:24:40,610 --> 02:24:42,000
Hacking democracy's great.
It's a,

3048
02:24:42,001 --> 02:24:44,490
it was an hbo documentary on those 
machines.

3049
02:24:44,491 --> 02:24:47,610
The diebold machines.
This is the hanging Chad.

3050
02:24:47,710 --> 02:24:50,250
No,
they rig the machines.

3051
02:24:50,280 --> 02:24:54,270
The machines were rigged so that they 
could have a third party enter data,

3052
02:24:54,271 --> 02:24:56,250
so like not just you,
not the person who counts,

3053
02:24:56,251 --> 02:24:58,620
but a third person enters data to 
change,

3054
02:24:58,650 --> 02:25:00,390
change the votes,
the machines,

3055
02:25:00,860 --> 02:25:01,693
the machines.
Machines were 100 percent hackable and 

3056
02:25:04,921 --> 02:25:05,754
they had designed them to be savable.
They designed them to have third party 

3057
02:25:08,791 --> 02:25:11,070
input and they showed on the,
in the hacking democracy.

3058
02:25:11,070 --> 02:25:12,900
The guY got into the thing and changed 
the vote.

3059
02:25:13,440 --> 02:25:14,273
He like changed a vote,
like a demonstrated it to them and then 

3060
02:25:16,411 --> 02:25:18,000
they were sitting there going,
what the fuck?

3061
02:25:18,001 --> 02:25:18,834
Like why did and not only that,
the guy who made those machines or the 

3062
02:25:21,751 --> 02:25:22,584
company who made those machines was a 
gigantic supporter of the republican 

3063
02:25:25,181 --> 02:25:26,014
party.
And this is when during the bush 

3064
02:25:28,121 --> 02:25:30,150
administration.
Yeah,

3065
02:25:30,250 --> 02:25:32,410
I mean they changed their name.
The company diebold,

3066
02:25:32,411 --> 02:25:33,880
they have this.
They had a switch their name.

3067
02:25:34,060 --> 02:25:35,410
They switched their name.
They don't.

3068
02:25:35,710 --> 02:25:40,710
They also make atm.
Now I'm now just getting people elected.

3069
02:25:42,570 --> 02:25:43,840
You make it payments.

3070
02:25:46,240 --> 02:25:47,073
It's crazy.
It's crazy how many high ranking 

3071
02:25:48,821 --> 02:25:52,480
republicans like renounced their.
You know,

3072
02:25:52,720 --> 02:25:55,180
their cards and announced that they were
done.

3073
02:25:55,270 --> 02:25:56,170
It's a lot.
Well,

3074
02:25:56,171 --> 02:25:59,190
here's one I forgot I wanted to bring up
that guy hastert.

3075
02:25:59,260 --> 02:26:01,570
I think that's his name.
Who got convicted?

3076
02:26:01,690 --> 02:26:06,690
He was sOme big time judge who got 
convicted of child molestation.

3077
02:26:07,090 --> 02:26:08,230
Oh,
old dennis?

3078
02:26:08,350 --> 02:26:09,730
yes.
Dennis hastert,

3079
02:26:09,790 --> 02:26:12,010
right?
Wasn't he a senator or congress?

3080
02:26:12,011 --> 02:26:14,680
What was he sentenced to?
Fifteen months.

3081
02:26:15,040 --> 02:26:16,800
That's It.
Oh my gosh.

3082
02:26:16,820 --> 02:26:18,880
Fifteen months.
That's all you get for that.

3083
02:26:19,300 --> 02:26:20,133
Yeah,
it was drake structuring bank 

3084
02:26:23,201 --> 02:26:24,860
transaction.
Scroll back down please.

3085
02:26:27,460 --> 02:26:28,293
Illegally structuring bank transactions 
and effort to cover up his sexual abuse 

3086
02:26:31,331 --> 02:26:34,060
of young members of the wrestling team 
that he coached decades ago.

3087
02:26:35,530 --> 02:26:39,670
What the fuck?
How you only get 15 months for that.

3088
02:26:40,290 --> 02:26:42,100
How do you.
How do you view as speaker that?

3089
02:26:43,590 --> 02:26:44,830
Yeah.
He was speaker of the house,

3090
02:26:44,831 --> 02:26:45,130
rIght?

3091
02:26:45,130 --> 02:26:46,180
Yeah.
Yeah.

3092
02:26:46,720 --> 02:26:50,740
How the fuck is he?
Old habits.

3093
02:26:51,350 --> 02:26:53,560
That might be a part of it.
He's so old.

3094
02:26:53,561 --> 02:26:54,440
Shoot him.
He was dead.

3095
02:26:54,450 --> 02:26:57,040
Eleven years with those kids all line 
up.

3096
02:26:57,370 --> 02:26:58,240
Hey look,
go back.

3097
02:26:58,300 --> 02:26:59,920
Please listen.
Read this here,

3098
02:27:00,040 --> 02:27:00,873
mr hasford 74 who made an unlikely rise 
from beloved small town wrestling coach 

3099
02:27:04,601 --> 02:27:06,670
in Illinois to speaker of the house in 
Washington,

3100
02:27:06,880 --> 02:27:07,713
sat,
slouched in a wheelchair in a federal 

3101
02:27:09,221 --> 02:27:10,054
courtroom here as judge announced that 
he would be rejecting please for 

3102
02:27:12,581 --> 02:27:14,910
probation.
He's got to play it hard on mr.

3103
02:27:14,920 --> 02:27:19,390
Hazard as well as the prosecutors 
endorsement of a shorter prison state.

3104
02:27:19,391 --> 02:27:22,840
What do shorter than fIfteen months?
He said,

3105
02:27:22,841 --> 02:27:26,350
look at the judge said the defendant is 
a serial child molester.

3106
02:27:26,650 --> 02:27:29,770
Wow.
Wow.

3107
02:27:29,830 --> 02:27:30,663
Look at this.
Some actions can obliterate a lifetime 

3108
02:27:33,191 --> 02:27:34,024
of good works.
Nothing is more stunning than having 

3109
02:27:36,401 --> 02:27:37,234
serial child molester and speaker of the
house in the same sentence that the 

3110
02:27:40,450 --> 02:27:43,830
judge 15 months is the is the full 
sentence for that.

3111
02:27:44,030 --> 02:27:47,320
Any ordered him to pay $250,000
in fines.

3112
02:27:47,710 --> 02:27:51,280
Even if you paid those kids a thousand 
bucks every time you fuck them.

3113
02:27:51,310 --> 02:27:52,860
Do you think it was 250 times?
No.

3114
02:27:53,050 --> 02:27:57,760
You got off cheap,
you know a job or you fan fan publishers

3115
02:27:58,400 --> 02:28:01,090
series of illnesses including his 
stroke,

3116
02:28:01,091 --> 02:28:03,820
blood stream infection.
So he's sickly and old,

3117
02:28:03,821 --> 02:28:04,654
which is,
I bet why they're not giving him the 

3118
02:28:06,851 --> 02:28:11,020
whole thing.
So I think they should cut his balls off

3119
02:28:11,660 --> 02:28:14,830
publicly.
He used a walker to rise to his feet,

3120
02:28:14,831 --> 02:28:15,664
but is cox did as he recounted the days 
when he would molest young wrestlers as 

3121
02:28:21,141 --> 02:28:24,260
a high school wrestler.
I looked up to coach hastert.

3122
02:28:24,410 --> 02:28:26,570
He was a key figure in my life.
Said mr.

3123
02:28:26,660 --> 02:28:30,500
Cross now 53 and a businessman who works
in the financial services in the chicago

3124
02:28:30,501 --> 02:28:33,500
area from a podium just feet from mr 
hasford wheelchair.

3125
02:28:33,501 --> 02:28:34,334
Mr krause recalled abuse that occurred 
on a locker room training table when he 

3126
02:28:38,391 --> 02:28:41,900
was 17.
I felt intense shame and guilt.

3127
02:28:42,500 --> 02:28:45,320
Holy shit.
Let a piece of shit.

3128
02:28:45,340 --> 02:28:49,550
This guy got away with it for so long.
Raping little kids.

3129
02:28:51,740 --> 02:28:55,880
Wow.
It's just amazing that that relationship

3130
02:28:55,881 --> 02:28:58,210
that he had as a speaker of the house 
allowed them knowing it.

3131
02:28:58,220 --> 02:29:00,200
Fifteen months should be in jail for 
life.

3132
02:29:00,230 --> 02:29:01,250
And he got,
by the way,

3133
02:29:01,260 --> 02:29:04,550
so many.
The judge received so many letters about

3134
02:29:04,700 --> 02:29:06,980
what an awesome guy and all the awesome 
things that he did.

3135
02:29:07,040 --> 02:29:08,210
Oh my people.
Just wanting,

3136
02:29:09,200 --> 02:29:10,250
everybody was,
you know,

3137
02:29:10,340 --> 02:29:13,580
I mean high ranking people were like,
he's done amazing work.

3138
02:29:13,660 --> 02:29:14,493
That must mean that he knows something.
They must have helped him because he 

3139
02:29:19,761 --> 02:29:20,594
knows something.
They must have been one of those things 

3140
02:29:21,981 --> 02:29:24,530
where I look,
if I go to jail fucked.

3141
02:29:24,820 --> 02:29:26,510
You write that fucking letter.
Yeah.

3142
02:29:27,060 --> 02:29:31,930
Who else stands up ever paternal.
Right.

3143
02:29:32,270 --> 02:29:33,950
That whole shit was going down with san 
dusty.

3144
02:29:33,951 --> 02:29:35,760
Even paternal was like,
ah,

3145
02:29:36,440 --> 02:29:37,940
I don't know shit.
What the fuck?

3146
02:29:37,941 --> 02:29:40,570
everybody backed away from sandusky.
Nobody's stood up first.

3147
02:29:40,610 --> 02:29:42,200
Of course.
Wow.

3148
02:29:43,700 --> 02:29:46,080
Right now I heard on the news this week 
and there's someone,

3149
02:29:46,100 --> 02:29:49,480
a doctor who used to work for the usa 
olympic team and like the gymnast.

3150
02:29:49,550 --> 02:29:51,080
Yeah.
He's been accused of.

3151
02:29:51,890 --> 02:29:54,950
I don't want to like I can tell you what
their sexual abuse allegations digitally

3152
02:29:54,951 --> 02:29:58,580
inserting girls to no gloves on and 
thought,

3153
02:29:58,581 --> 02:29:59,414
oh jesus,
he's going in their pussy to correct 

3154
02:30:01,131 --> 02:30:01,964
their back.
That's what he was saying he was doing 

3155
02:30:04,240 --> 02:30:06,410
on trips with no parents around and 
whatnot.

3156
02:30:06,500 --> 02:30:10,190
Oh my god.
I learned that technique years ago,

3157
02:30:10,191 --> 02:30:13,130
but I didn't know that it was the wife 
of a straight posture.

3158
02:30:13,131 --> 02:30:16,830
I did notice that maybe the three digit 
technique it's held.

3159
02:30:17,480 --> 02:30:19,430
Yeah.
just threatened with the pinky,

3160
02:30:19,431 --> 02:30:20,264
right?
Yup.

3161
02:30:23,120 --> 02:30:27,710
Shoulders back.
What the fuck man?

3162
02:30:27,890 --> 02:30:28,880
Oh my god.
Dude.

3163
02:30:29,140 --> 02:30:29,973
That's scary stuff.
Did you hear about kim kardashian 

3164
02:30:33,111 --> 02:30:37,040
getting held up at like tied up and tied
up?

3165
02:30:37,160 --> 02:30:38,540
Gagged.
Terrible.

3166
02:30:38,541 --> 02:30:39,800
Man.
That is terrible.

3167
02:30:40,050 --> 02:30:42,710
Scary shit.
And the guys were dressed up as cop.

3168
02:30:42,860 --> 02:30:47,860
This is a really well planned robbery.
That's terrifying.

3169
02:30:48,800 --> 02:30:50,300
Yeah.
$9,000,000

3170
02:30:50,301 --> 02:30:52,190
in jewelry.
They had $9,000,000

3171
02:30:52,191 --> 02:30:53,480
in jewelry on them.
Jewelry.

3172
02:30:53,690 --> 02:30:54,800
That's incredible.
Yeah.

3173
02:30:55,610 --> 02:30:56,443
Yeah.
I heard that he was performing in the 

3174
02:30:58,041 --> 02:30:58,874
middle of a song.
Cut is somebody ran on stage and told 

3175
02:31:01,521 --> 02:31:02,930
him.
He said there was a family emergency and

3176
02:31:03,040 --> 02:31:04,550
took off.
When You say him,

3177
02:31:04,551 --> 02:31:06,100
you mean kanye west?
Yes.

3178
02:31:06,180 --> 02:31:07,013
Yes.
Most people don't know yeezy is who I 

3179
02:31:08,931 --> 02:31:10,720
was talking about.
What the fuck?

3180
02:31:10,810 --> 02:31:12,380
Jesus.
How scary.

3181
02:31:12,381 --> 02:31:15,440
That must be someone robbing you.
Imagine how $9,000,000

3182
02:31:15,441 --> 02:31:18,260
of jewelry on youtube you have flew 
internationally with.

3183
02:31:18,380 --> 02:31:20,880
Yeah.
You have a dope house on you.

3184
02:31:21,270 --> 02:31:21,970
Yeah.
No,

3185
02:31:21,970 --> 02:31:22,803
that's a dope house.
And you're flossing it everywhere you 

3186
02:31:24,061 --> 02:31:25,710
go.
Yeah.

3187
02:31:25,740 --> 02:31:27,150
Yeah.
9 million.

3188
02:31:27,390 --> 02:31:30,030
The amount of money they make the.
I read something about her,

3189
02:31:30,090 --> 02:31:30,923
her app,
the amount of money that she makes us 

3190
02:31:32,360 --> 02:31:33,630
some app.
It's absurd.

3191
02:31:33,631 --> 02:31:35,110
It's like $50,000,000
a month or something.

3192
02:31:35,150 --> 02:31:35,983
Something?
Yeah,

3193
02:31:37,110 --> 02:31:39,020
50 or $80 million a year as what I saw.
Yeah.

3194
02:31:39,080 --> 02:31:41,970
Well I might've made up some numbers,
but that's still an outrageous amount of

3195
02:31:41,971 --> 02:31:44,100
money.
It's incredible for to play a game where

3196
02:31:44,101 --> 02:31:45,780
you're like,
I'm kim and buying a purse or something.

3197
02:31:47,250 --> 02:31:49,530
She got robbed at gunpoint.
Paris.

3198
02:31:50,100 --> 02:31:52,310
Paris seems like a dangerous functions 
part.

3199
02:31:52,990 --> 02:31:54,810
Shit keeps going down in paris.
yeah.

3200
02:31:54,830 --> 02:31:57,900
It keeps going down.
Charlie hebdo and the nightclub shooting

3201
02:31:57,901 --> 02:31:59,220
thing.
Yeah.

3202
02:31:59,340 --> 02:32:01,470
Nice.
France like France itself.

3203
02:32:01,471 --> 02:32:02,261
Nice.
France was the,

3204
02:32:02,261 --> 02:32:03,094
the,
the truck that drove over all those 

3205
02:32:04,051 --> 02:32:06,630
peoples.
Kk got robbed.

3206
02:32:11,250 --> 02:32:12,570
magical.
Went up a kid today.

3207
02:32:12,690 --> 02:32:16,090
These your.
Yeah.

3208
02:32:16,210 --> 02:32:18,110
Brought in $100,000,000
since the launch.

3209
02:32:18,130 --> 02:32:18,963
Jesus.
I think what she went through is 

3210
02:32:20,100 --> 02:32:22,590
absolutely terrifying.
That's got to be really,

3211
02:32:22,591 --> 02:32:23,820
really horrible.
100 percent.

3212
02:32:24,330 --> 02:32:28,260
Do you want to predict what kind of guy 
angelina jolie hooks up with?

3213
02:32:28,450 --> 02:32:32,660
This is what I do.
This long hair wouldn't beads for sure.

3214
02:32:33,180 --> 02:32:34,013
Probably does yoga.
Maybe in the peace corps he's going to 

3215
02:32:36,031 --> 02:32:40,940
be really poor and um,
and it doesn't care about money and um,

3216
02:32:41,490 --> 02:32:44,550
he's like a,
he's more of an activist than,

3217
02:32:44,660 --> 02:32:45,493
and it doesn't even act right,
but then she's going to dump him after 

3218
02:32:48,151 --> 02:32:48,984
he wants to act because once they're 
together for awhile it was going to get 

3219
02:32:51,061 --> 02:32:51,894
some offers to do some stuff.
She's gonna want him to go to a 

3220
02:32:54,331 --> 02:32:55,164
basketball game.
He has won a couple of public 

3221
02:32:57,601 --> 02:32:58,920
appearances.
yeah.

3222
02:32:59,750 --> 02:33:01,170
That is really spot on.

3223
02:33:01,170 --> 02:33:02,003
I think you're,
I think you're really right here and 

3224
02:33:03,420 --> 02:33:04,940
someone not in the public eye.
Yeah.

3225
02:33:05,610 --> 02:33:06,443
Just an unknown guy.
You're like an earthy kind of like raw 

3226
02:33:09,771 --> 02:33:14,040
cotton shirt.
He sows his own clothing,

3227
02:33:14,041 --> 02:33:15,270
you know,
that kind of thing.

3228
02:33:15,600 --> 02:33:16,433
yeah.
Kudler did you know that there are 

3229
02:33:19,081 --> 02:33:19,914
people that are,
they're called cuddle lists and they 

3230
02:33:21,871 --> 02:33:23,640
cuddle you for money.
He's that guy.

3231
02:33:23,670 --> 02:33:24,720
Yeah.
I've heard of that,

3232
02:33:24,721 --> 02:33:26,040
but I don't.
I can just come here.

3233
02:33:26,160 --> 02:33:28,560
Can you get hard?
What happens?

3234
02:33:28,561 --> 02:33:30,480
You got to deal with that.
You used that bomb.

3235
02:33:31,290 --> 02:33:32,960
There's just a lot.
Yeah.

3236
02:33:33,270 --> 02:33:37,500
Tickling and she does fluctuate though.
So before brad didn't,

3237
02:33:37,530 --> 02:33:38,363
wasn't she with billy?
Bob thornton and she used to carry his 

3238
02:33:40,741 --> 02:33:42,330
blood around in a violent.
Her neck.

3239
02:33:43,730 --> 02:33:44,880
Crazy.
She must be in bed.

3240
02:33:44,950 --> 02:33:45,783
Oh,
she might go weird again because brad 

3241
02:33:48,841 --> 02:33:50,970
seemed real normal.
Right.

3242
02:33:51,300 --> 02:33:52,133
But go weird again.
She could control that hot guy just 

3243
02:33:56,131 --> 02:33:58,100
saying which she could control billy bob
shaw.

3244
02:33:58,101 --> 02:34:00,960
Like I like this better.
The hot one.

3245
02:34:00,961 --> 02:34:02,710
Look at the two of them.
Yeah.

3246
02:34:02,850 --> 02:34:05,490
He had a bra.
I like the sunglasses.

3247
02:34:05,491 --> 02:34:07,110
It's not like it's night or anything.
Yeah,

3248
02:34:07,260 --> 02:34:08,550
keep those on billy.
For sure.

3249
02:34:09,350 --> 02:34:10,330
Yeah.
yeah.

3250
02:34:11,050 --> 02:34:12,750
She's eaten butthole for sure.
Sure.

3251
02:34:13,470 --> 02:34:14,470
Everybody's.
Yeah.

3252
02:34:14,680 --> 02:34:15,570
Everybody's should mates.

3253
02:34:17,790 --> 02:34:18,030
That's

3254
02:34:18,030 --> 02:34:18,863
actually greets you.
She got billy bob tattooed on her way 

3255
02:34:22,211 --> 02:34:23,044
into that guy.
He's grabbing her tits right there in 

3256
02:34:23,981 --> 02:34:27,150
front of America.
Probably a whole lot of fun.

3257
02:34:27,250 --> 02:34:28,590
Whole lot of crazy.
Yeah.

3258
02:34:28,660 --> 02:34:29,500
Yeah.
Next guy.

3259
02:34:29,530 --> 02:34:33,370
Yogi like probably wears flip flops a 
lot.

3260
02:34:34,630 --> 02:34:36,190
Yeah,
totally.

3261
02:34:36,440 --> 02:34:39,070
It's got to have some edge to them.
That's what's going to excite or kind of

3262
02:34:39,080 --> 02:34:43,870
a little edge and I think she's going to
want to control the guy.

3263
02:34:44,170 --> 02:34:45,003
Plus there's the kids,
there's a lot of kids where he's got to 

3264
02:34:46,991 --> 02:34:49,930
be real into being stepdaddy.
She's like,

3265
02:34:49,931 --> 02:34:50,764
what do you,
how you feel about seven kids or with 

3266
02:34:53,640 --> 02:34:56,500
the crazier move p to never have a 
relationship again,

3267
02:34:57,040 --> 02:34:59,030
just to dedicate herself to children 
from now on,

3268
02:34:59,200 --> 02:35:01,900
a character that could be the move that 
she might be the move.

3269
02:35:02,030 --> 02:35:03,250
Yeah,
and then she goes,

3270
02:35:03,251 --> 02:35:04,084
j lo style just gets a bunch of little 
boys so fox kicks him out the fuck out 

3271
02:35:07,671 --> 02:35:10,570
of my house,
but you know,

3272
02:35:11,350 --> 02:35:13,330
maybe that's the move.
If I divorced tom,

3273
02:35:13,331 --> 02:35:16,090
I might do that.
Why get married again?

3274
02:35:16,160 --> 02:35:18,130
You can't.
He's the love of my life.

3275
02:35:18,160 --> 02:35:20,940
This would be wham song.
Never gonna dance again.

3276
02:35:20,941 --> 02:35:25,941
Just started playing on my speculation 
is always fun.

3277
02:35:32,010 --> 02:35:34,810
Would you go for the young pretty young,
young things,

3278
02:35:35,310 --> 02:35:39,090
the pyt she would go for the big black 
guys.

3279
02:35:42,050 --> 02:35:44,620
No,
I'm not into the black guys.

3280
02:35:44,640 --> 02:35:46,660
You would be after tom.
You guys.

3281
02:35:47,110 --> 02:35:50,020
The one thing you'd be like,
I heard that music for so many years,

3282
02:35:50,021 --> 02:35:52,870
I want to give it a shot and try them 
and then you would like it.

3283
02:35:53,660 --> 02:35:56,470
Walk me through the logic though.
Give me the backstory.

3284
02:35:56,990 --> 02:36:01,990
Toms was terrified of is just a football
player with a giant hog.

3285
02:36:02,480 --> 02:36:03,560
Yeah.
Yeah.

3286
02:36:03,590 --> 02:36:04,260
But I kinda,
you know,

3287
02:36:04,260 --> 02:36:08,200
I kinda fantasize about it til.
Well that's the thing.

3288
02:36:08,950 --> 02:36:09,783
I'm kind of,
I feel like I'm kind of in the room and 

3289
02:36:11,951 --> 02:36:13,650
I'm like go get it,
get it,

3290
02:36:13,710 --> 02:36:15,630
get it man.
Like I'm kinda like,

3291
02:36:15,640 --> 02:36:16,473
what'd you want to be in the room?
Like an invisible bubble where they 

3292
02:36:19,511 --> 02:36:21,740
couldn't hear you and you can just yell 
out and,

3293
02:36:21,750 --> 02:36:22,583
and he would just jerk off freely and,
or would you want them to know you were 

3294
02:36:27,011 --> 02:36:28,430
there and just kinda whimper a little 
bit.

3295
02:36:28,431 --> 02:36:31,750
I kind of fell inside him in the balls 
at the same time.

3296
02:36:31,751 --> 02:36:35,110
The invisible part would be cool.
But also like if I'm like,

3297
02:36:35,740 --> 02:36:39,040
yeah trey like kinda like kind of behind
them,

3298
02:36:39,041 --> 02:36:39,874
you know?

3299
02:36:43,080 --> 02:36:43,913
And he's like shut up white boy.
Like he's talked some shit and I'm 

3300
02:36:46,200 --> 02:36:46,930
sorry.
He's like,

3301
02:36:46,930 --> 02:36:47,763
does he make you suck his dick or 
sometimes they do not make the 

3302
02:36:50,470 --> 02:36:51,303
motherfucker,
I don't want to go back to fucking the 

3303
02:36:54,131 --> 02:36:54,964
girl,
but I want a cuckold is that's extreme 

3304
02:36:58,880 --> 02:37:01,830
cuckold with a racial bias.
I want to do that.

3305
02:37:03,520 --> 02:37:07,600
I want to walk up behind like when he's 
done and you're like,

3306
02:37:07,660 --> 02:37:09,770
oh my god,
you know,

3307
02:37:09,910 --> 02:37:10,850
he's like,
he like,

3308
02:37:10,960 --> 02:37:11,980
he shakes it off.
He's like,

3309
02:37:11,981 --> 02:37:12,814
oh,
like that.

3310
02:37:13,090 --> 02:37:14,450
And he's like,
I go,

3311
02:37:14,451 --> 02:37:15,590
oh,
I guess it's my turn.

3312
02:37:15,770 --> 02:37:16,100
And then he's

3313
02:37:16,100 --> 02:37:16,510
like,
nah,

3314
02:37:16,510 --> 02:37:17,870
hold on.
And then he's like,

3315
02:37:17,871 --> 02:37:18,704
yo.
And then like six guys come in and he's 

3316
02:37:20,311 --> 02:37:22,180
like,
they got to go first and then like,

3317
02:37:22,610 --> 02:37:24,200
what's the,
what's the tagline?

3318
02:37:24,230 --> 02:37:26,900
You know how they need a funny line to 
wrap up the scene?

3319
02:37:28,270 --> 02:37:30,450
Like shaking a paintbrush.
Yeah,

3320
02:37:30,580 --> 02:37:31,413
yeah.
I think that moves getting more popular 

3321
02:37:34,540 --> 02:37:35,373
st.
That's the equivalent of dropping the 

3322
02:37:36,291 --> 02:37:37,124
mic and for now,
but then he's like in took your wife or 

3323
02:37:39,801 --> 02:37:40,634
what's the,
wHat's the seal to the button to the 

3324
02:37:43,610 --> 02:37:46,490
scene and through your writing,
that's what they call black.

3325
02:37:46,570 --> 02:37:49,830
Imagine that painter that does that.
What's jackson pollock?

3326
02:37:50,010 --> 02:37:52,310
Jackson poLlock.
Bob ross,

3327
02:37:52,620 --> 02:37:53,453
no,
jackson pollock's the guy that throws 

3328
02:37:54,411 --> 02:37:56,090
the pain all over the place.
That's what it would be.

3329
02:37:58,000 --> 02:37:59,670
Then he'd be like,
that's my jackson pollock,

3330
02:38:00,000 --> 02:38:01,940
the line.
They all do it.

3331
02:38:01,941 --> 02:38:04,730
Plop and some dudes have yellow color.
Who's coming as yo.

3332
02:38:05,960 --> 02:38:06,950
What the fuck he.
He,

3333
02:38:07,140 --> 02:38:08,210
he,
he drops like that.

3334
02:38:08,211 --> 02:38:09,560
He goes,
they put that in the getty.

3335
02:38:12,510 --> 02:38:13,700
Nailed it.
That's the line.

3336
02:38:13,730 --> 02:38:15,410
They definitely could put it in lacma.
Yeah,

3337
02:38:16,210 --> 02:38:20,600
that's right.
We saw the robert maplethorpe exhibit at

3338
02:38:20,601 --> 02:38:24,140
the getty see piss christ.
No,

3339
02:38:25,130 --> 02:38:25,850
no,
but that was like.

3340
02:38:25,850 --> 02:38:26,683
I liked the way you said you really.
The definitive maplethorpe work was 

3341
02:38:30,470 --> 02:38:35,060
christ or guys getting fisted and 
assholes and cox.

3342
02:38:35,180 --> 02:38:38,390
None of that was on the walls and I was 
so upset.

3343
02:38:38,680 --> 02:38:39,710
All.
Yeah,

3344
02:38:39,711 --> 02:38:41,510
some,
some nice portraits.

3345
02:38:41,511 --> 02:38:42,590
Maybe one dick.

3346
02:38:43,180 --> 02:38:45,520
I saw the exhibit when I was living in 
boston.

3347
02:38:45,521 --> 02:38:50,521
That's piss christ the crucifix.
Dunked in a bucket of pis or ullico jar.

3348
02:38:52,030 --> 02:38:54,700
Plastic piss.
Christ glass jar of pis.

3349
02:38:55,000 --> 02:38:55,780
Yeah,
and it,

3350
02:38:55,780 --> 02:38:59,240
it became a huge thing in the eighties.
Really?

3351
02:38:59,260 --> 02:39:00,093
Yeah,
because people felt like it was 

3352
02:39:00,400 --> 02:39:04,440
blasphemous and the religious people are
super upset because I just,

3353
02:39:04,450 --> 02:39:05,283
I might be wrong,
but I feel like he might have gotten 

3354
02:39:06,821 --> 02:39:10,240
some public funding like for,
for his art.

3355
02:39:10,870 --> 02:39:13,600
I feel like you might have gotten grants
or something for his art,

3356
02:39:13,800 --> 02:39:14,633
so we're in the wrong business.
Be fun just to see my parents have an 

3357
02:39:16,841 --> 02:39:18,190
aneurism.
We can show him that.

3358
02:39:18,630 --> 02:39:20,450
See their heads.
What's her mom's name?

3359
02:39:20,910 --> 02:39:22,900
You got to understand.
This was pre internet.

3360
02:39:23,490 --> 02:39:26,960
I was.
I went to his exhibit really 80.

3361
02:39:27,250 --> 02:39:29,800
I want to say that.
80 eight or 89.

3362
02:39:31,270 --> 02:39:32,590
I want to say it might've been earlier.

3363
02:39:32,590 --> 02:39:33,423
It might been [inaudible] 87.
it might have been before I did stand 

3364
02:39:34,781 --> 02:39:36,010
up.
Wow.

3365
02:39:36,430 --> 02:39:37,870
Okay.
Did look at that.

3366
02:39:37,900 --> 02:39:38,733
Oh my god.
From the taxpayer funded national 

3367
02:39:41,681 --> 02:39:44,590
endowment for the arts.
She received $15,000

3368
02:39:44,591 --> 02:39:47,890
for the work and $5,000
in 1986 for piss.

3369
02:39:47,891 --> 02:39:50,530
Christ is a different guy though.
maplethorpe's the.

3370
02:39:51,450 --> 02:39:53,260
Oh,
this is serrano is piss christ.

3371
02:39:53,261 --> 02:39:53,771
Yeah.
oh,

3372
02:39:53,771 --> 02:39:55,030
you got serrano,
dude.

3373
02:39:55,150 --> 02:39:56,170
Different one.
Yeah.

3374
02:39:56,171 --> 02:40:01,171
Maplethorpe's piss christ multiple ones.
Maybe it's serrano's.

3375
02:40:01,271 --> 02:40:02,050
Piss.
Christ is,

3376
02:40:02,050 --> 02:40:02,883
is it maplethorpe's piss christ.
Is that the same guy that doesn't 

3377
02:40:06,251 --> 02:40:10,690
involve balls and cox and my wrong.
I feel like I'm,

3378
02:40:11,740 --> 02:40:14,070
I feel like that was who made it was 
maple thorp,

3379
02:40:15,130 --> 02:40:16,110
right?
Piss christ.

3380
02:40:16,530 --> 02:40:18,650
Maybe I'm wrong.
Maybe I can flag elated.

3381
02:40:19,640 --> 02:40:22,220
Did I,
did maplethorpe have one,

3382
02:40:22,230 --> 02:40:23,130
two,
or did I make it up?

3383
02:40:23,160 --> 02:40:23,993
If you take a picture of it,
he could have is that it will find out 

3384
02:40:29,580 --> 02:40:34,580
or tag or for photographs for a brief 
history of piss.

3385
02:40:37,380 --> 02:40:40,110
Christ is maplethorpe to do with it.
Anything with it?

3386
02:40:41,700 --> 02:40:42,970
It's in there.
There it is.

3387
02:40:43,730 --> 02:40:46,270
Okay.
As maple thought.

3388
02:40:46,420 --> 02:40:47,253
Oh,
it's just that he was also granted 

3389
02:40:48,031 --> 02:40:48,864
money.
It looks like a punishment for its role 

3390
02:40:51,751 --> 02:40:53,430
in supporting the work of an artist at 
nea.

3391
02:40:53,431 --> 02:40:56,610
Saw it's funding for the next year.
Cut by $45,000

3392
02:40:56,611 --> 02:40:57,830
because of that.
Oh,

3393
02:40:57,900 --> 02:40:58,733
okay.
Here it goes.

3394
02:40:59,030 --> 02:41:00,930
Uh,
funded to given to serrano made piss.

3395
02:41:00,931 --> 02:41:02,790
Christ by the way,
have an nea supported,

3396
02:41:03,020 --> 02:41:03,853
see a feLlowship and another $30,000
to atone for the sum given and support 

3397
02:41:07,771 --> 02:41:08,604
of a robert maplethorpe show at the 
philadelphia institute of contemporary 

3398
02:41:11,581 --> 02:41:12,510
art.
Okay.

3399
02:41:12,511 --> 02:41:14,010
So he didn't do it,
it was somebody else.

3400
02:41:15,780 --> 02:41:20,570
So maplethorpe was just all the fists 
and buttholes and stuff.

3401
02:41:20,640 --> 02:41:21,473
Yeah.
But really was upsetting that they 

3402
02:41:23,011 --> 02:41:26,220
wouldn't show that stuff.
Like that's what the guy is known for it

3403
02:41:26,221 --> 02:41:27,054
don't give me this,
that we're looking at patty smith 

3404
02:41:28,411 --> 02:41:29,580
portraits the whole time.

3405
02:41:29,850 --> 02:41:30,930
but he did that too,
right?

3406
02:41:30,931 --> 02:41:32,220
Like,
why is it,

3407
02:41:32,370 --> 02:41:33,203
why,
why do we have such a hard time with 

3408
02:41:35,311 --> 02:41:37,590
sex?
Like that kind of stuff,

3409
02:41:37,591 --> 02:41:40,200
but not a hard time with violence.
Like we were talking about.

3410
02:41:40,620 --> 02:41:42,500
We're talking about um,
uh,

3411
02:41:42,570 --> 02:41:44,520
narcos,
so violent,

3412
02:41:44,660 --> 02:41:46,420
so crazy violent,
you know,

3413
02:41:46,540 --> 02:41:50,730
but it's a lot of sex in that show too.
But we're.

3414
02:41:50,731 --> 02:41:53,430
So it's okay.
Like we don't,

3415
02:41:53,460 --> 02:41:54,293
we don't have nearly as much,
like I don't want to give away any 

3416
02:41:57,121 --> 02:41:58,950
spoiler alerts,
but there was a,

3417
02:41:58,990 --> 02:42:02,040
there's a scene where a kid gets shot.
I don't want to say when,

3418
02:42:02,070 --> 02:42:04,470
when it happens,
but when it happens,

3419
02:42:04,471 --> 02:42:09,240
it's so graphic and I was thinking that 
is so crazy that they can show that kind

3420
02:42:09,241 --> 02:42:13,050
of violence like violence and adult 
versus against a kid.

3421
02:42:13,530 --> 02:42:16,470
But you could never show like actual 
sex.

3422
02:42:17,450 --> 02:42:18,630
Do you remember,
um,

3423
02:42:18,780 --> 02:42:19,613
that vince gallo movie brown bunny,
where chloe sevigny ne blows in the 

3424
02:42:25,560 --> 02:42:26,720
saving seven.

3425
02:42:26,730 --> 02:42:28,120
Yay.
Isn't that?

3426
02:42:28,160 --> 02:42:29,030
That's not the movie.
Attend.

3427
02:42:29,040 --> 02:42:32,400
They'll write down bunny.
She blows me.

3428
02:42:32,440 --> 02:42:35,010
Comes on her face.
She said that really,

3429
02:42:35,040 --> 02:42:35,920
really,
you know,

3430
02:42:35,940 --> 02:42:39,380
fucked up her career.
It should be smart.

3431
02:42:40,230 --> 02:42:41,500
Well,
what does he think?

3432
02:42:41,501 --> 02:42:44,250
I mean,
I guess he was making the same argument,

3433
02:42:44,251 --> 02:42:45,720
right?
He was making the argument like,

3434
02:42:45,721 --> 02:42:50,721
why is it okay to have violence?
Why is it okay to have all these aspects

3435
02:42:50,910 --> 02:42:54,000
of people kissing and grabbing each 
other's asses?

3436
02:42:54,001 --> 02:42:57,280
We can have actual sex.
He also just wanted a blow job.

3437
02:42:57,330 --> 02:42:58,163
Probably.
Probably.

3438
02:42:58,620 --> 02:43:01,250
I don't know if he,
maybe the body,

3439
02:43:01,260 --> 02:43:02,093
you have to look at it that way.
But then the irony too is on mainstream 

3440
02:43:05,640 --> 02:43:07,770
television shows,
it's all tna.

3441
02:43:08,770 --> 02:43:09,603
I can't watch glee.
I told you on netflix and that's really 

3442
02:43:11,921 --> 02:43:12,160
just

3443
02:43:12,160 --> 02:43:12,993
eye candy.
It's a bunch of high school girl 

3444
02:43:14,351 --> 02:43:16,780
cheerleader outfits.
You know about fox news,

3445
02:43:17,380 --> 02:43:18,213
right?
What they're doing with their legs to 

3446
02:43:19,451 --> 02:43:20,284
pageants.
They're all just slipped up and shave 

3447
02:43:22,401 --> 02:43:27,100
down and scissoring crossing the legs.
It's amazing.

3448
02:43:27,130 --> 02:43:30,190
Yeah.
Imagine if men could read the news and a

3449
02:43:30,191 --> 02:43:33,280
tank top of you can be in a top in 
bikini underwear,

3450
02:43:33,281 --> 02:43:36,010
just reading the news,
just shredded,

3451
02:43:36,130 --> 02:43:37,960
shaved down,
oiled up.

3452
02:43:38,500 --> 02:43:41,440
Such a great world.
Lips your lips done.

3453
02:43:41,560 --> 02:43:43,620
Big fucking pirate hoop earrings,
right?

3454
02:43:43,960 --> 02:43:46,730
Just let people know you're ready.
I mean,

3455
02:43:46,840 --> 02:43:47,673
look,
tom watches these espn for hour after 

3456
02:43:50,651 --> 02:43:55,270
football shows where they called fucking
sport sash or whatever,

3457
02:43:55,710 --> 02:43:58,690
and these guys that are working on these
shows,

3458
02:43:58,691 --> 02:44:00,280
they're fucking basset hounds,
man.

3459
02:44:00,310 --> 02:44:02,680
They're mostly older,
unattractIve,

3460
02:44:02,840 --> 02:44:07,150
and there's no way a woman would be able
to get away with looking like shit on tv

3461
02:44:07,151 --> 02:44:09,760
the way these dudes do,
but their football experts.

3462
02:44:09,820 --> 02:44:10,720
Right?
That's true.

3463
02:44:11,010 --> 02:44:11,920
I mean,
okay,

3464
02:44:11,921 --> 02:44:14,770
but there's no attractive.
It's not the news,

3465
02:44:15,190 --> 02:44:19,150
but even show on news though,
the standards.

3466
02:44:19,360 --> 02:44:21,820
It's true that for,
for men.

3467
02:44:21,880 --> 02:44:22,840
Oh yeah.
Way different.

3468
02:44:24,110 --> 02:44:25,600
There's some real fucking dogs.
Yeah.

3469
02:44:25,810 --> 02:44:28,840
The women can't.
They either had to be really old,

3470
02:44:28,841 --> 02:44:30,850
like Barbara Walters.
Stateswoman.

3471
02:44:31,480 --> 02:44:32,313
Yes.
But what's interesting is they have 

3472
02:44:35,201 --> 02:44:38,950
these like really like ridiculously hot 
women and they're reading the news,

3473
02:44:38,951 --> 02:44:40,510
but they don't have to know shit about 
the news.

3474
02:44:40,630 --> 02:44:42,340
They just have to read off a 
teleprompter.

3475
02:44:42,550 --> 02:44:45,850
It's the comparison with the football 
guys is worth because football is one of

3476
02:44:45,851 --> 02:44:47,830
those things like,
I don't know shit about football,

3477
02:44:47,920 --> 02:44:48,753
but there's some dudes who knows 
everything about fulbright and they can 

3478
02:44:51,551 --> 02:44:52,384
recall games from the 19 sixties and the
play that was news to win super bowl 44 

3479
02:44:57,281 --> 02:45:00,400
and those fucking guys like that.
They essentially to.

3480
02:45:00,430 --> 02:45:01,263
They do what you do in that they can 
look at a play that took seven seconds 

3481
02:45:04,870 --> 02:45:08,230
and tell you everything that happened 
the same way you can tell.

3482
02:45:08,470 --> 02:45:12,010
You know how a guy got beat like in your
gut.

3483
02:45:12,011 --> 02:45:13,240
Well,
his arm drop there.

3484
02:45:13,510 --> 02:45:17,710
The guy saw an opportunity to put him in
a chokehold like you see that fast.

3485
02:45:17,830 --> 02:45:20,620
These guys go,
they watch the play in right away.

3486
02:45:20,621 --> 02:45:21,454
They go,
well what happened was that linebacker 

3487
02:45:23,140 --> 02:45:25,780
he got,
he got tricked into thinking he,

3488
02:45:25,840 --> 02:45:27,070
he,
he bit for the fake.

3489
02:45:27,280 --> 02:45:28,113
So he came up.
It opened up this guy to run across the 

3490
02:45:29,711 --> 02:45:31,540
middle.
Like they do that in two seconds,

3491
02:45:31,541 --> 02:45:33,880
but you know what I mean.
They should be hot.

3492
02:45:33,940 --> 02:45:35,350
I get that.
The thing is,

3493
02:45:35,351 --> 02:45:39,040
look at 60 minutes,
that fucking dead.

3494
02:45:39,070 --> 02:45:41,460
Is he dead?
Let him on tv,

3495
02:45:41,650 --> 02:45:46,650
morley safer and andy rooney is 
definitely couldn't even towards the end

3496
02:45:47,530 --> 02:45:48,363
of his life and they're letting that guy
on tv and they're complaining that 

3497
02:45:50,471 --> 02:45:52,900
Barbara Walters is too old.
What are you talking about?

3498
02:45:52,901 --> 02:45:54,630
This guy can barely get through a 
fucking set.

3499
02:45:54,640 --> 02:45:55,480
That's true.
Yeah,

3500
02:45:55,481 --> 02:45:56,141
that's true.
Yeah.

3501
02:45:56,141 --> 02:45:56,974
I mean he was definitelY old and not tv,
not camera ready and as they would say 

3502
02:46:00,420 --> 02:46:02,220
like diane soria,
she's like,

3503
02:46:02,230 --> 02:46:03,280
she's still hanging in there,
right?

3504
02:46:03,390 --> 02:46:04,780
Yeah.
You're still strong,

3505
02:46:04,810 --> 02:46:09,560
but that's like another state's woman,
a woman who's established,

3506
02:46:09,830 --> 02:46:10,450
respected,

3507
02:46:10,450 --> 02:46:11,283
and is very smart.
She's not fuckable as long as she's of 

3508
02:46:12,981 --> 02:46:17,570
the age where she's unbelievable.
She was though she was hot,

3509
02:46:17,810 --> 02:46:18,643
beautiful like that back in the day,
but she never did like meghan kelly 

3510
02:46:21,141 --> 02:46:25,790
stuff like see Megan Kelly from fox's 
sexy sexy photo shoots and stuff like,

3511
02:46:25,970 --> 02:46:27,020
oh,
did you do photo shoots?

3512
02:46:27,170 --> 02:46:29,690
But I think a sawyer or one of leslie 
stall,

3513
02:46:30,410 --> 02:46:35,410
leslie stall or sawyer shirts hanging 
off the shoulder photo spread out.

3514
02:46:39,490 --> 02:46:41,050
Why do you do that?
Why?

3515
02:46:41,090 --> 02:46:41,923
Because it's hot as fuck.
She taught us the son go to the full 

3516
02:46:44,121 --> 02:46:45,020
body.
One uP there,

3517
02:46:45,240 --> 02:46:46,610
up left,
left,

3518
02:46:46,620 --> 02:46:49,970
left.
She's hot as the sun.

3519
02:46:50,030 --> 02:46:52,280
That's why she's doing that.
Because every guy is like,

3520
02:46:52,290 --> 02:46:56,200
oh,
I give up.

3521
02:46:56,430 --> 02:46:58,670
Touch me.
Please not even say.

3522
02:46:58,671 --> 02:47:00,770
I mean,
one day she had a real fun.

3523
02:47:01,010 --> 02:47:02,660
Trump battled.
Yeah.

3524
02:47:02,661 --> 02:47:04,580
But she gave in.
She gave in.

3525
02:47:05,190 --> 02:47:05,540
Yeah.

3526
02:47:05,540 --> 02:47:06,430
She had a meeting with.
Wait,

3527
02:47:06,431 --> 02:47:06,740
whoa,
whoa blah.

3528
02:47:06,740 --> 02:47:07,011
Whoa,
whoa.

3529
02:47:07,011 --> 02:47:08,900
That's not really the lingerie one's not
real is it?

3530
02:47:09,660 --> 02:47:11,360
Don't even click on it.
Don't get my hopes up.

3531
02:47:11,830 --> 02:47:12,591
Um,
yeah.

3532
02:47:12,591 --> 02:47:13,424
She,
she gave in and sat down with them and 

3533
02:47:14,691 --> 02:47:15,524
was like a,
they had like a friendly conversation 

3534
02:47:18,771 --> 02:47:23,771
and she was like really forgiving what?
Not just forgiving but like,

3535
02:47:23,870 --> 02:47:27,350
she backed off like a lot,
like she backed up and it was just.

3536
02:47:28,020 --> 02:47:28,853
I mean,
I get it.

3537
02:47:29,150 --> 02:47:30,200
That's your job,
you know,

3538
02:47:30,201 --> 02:47:33,200
if you want to be the conservative,
he's a conservative icon,

3539
02:47:33,320 --> 02:47:34,340
right?
I mean he's in that.

3540
02:47:34,640 --> 02:47:36,500
Is that her?
No,

3541
02:47:36,501 --> 02:47:37,990
that's not her.
Who is that?

3542
02:47:39,430 --> 02:47:41,760
Who's that?
That might be another one of the.

3543
02:47:41,890 --> 02:47:44,090
Here's a bunch of them.
That's not her though.

3544
02:47:44,160 --> 02:47:46,620
No,
unless it was her,

3545
02:47:46,621 --> 02:47:48,380
which was nice young lady.
It might be her.

3546
02:47:48,470 --> 02:47:49,700
That might be her when she was younger.

3547
02:47:50,630 --> 02:47:53,150
Yeah.
Might be entirely possible,

3548
02:47:54,110 --> 02:47:55,670
but yeah,
guys don't do that.

3549
02:47:55,700 --> 02:47:58,430
Like what fucking fox news anchors can 
have his shirt off,

3550
02:47:58,670 --> 02:47:59,503
shaved down and like,
like laying back like sensual with his 

3551
02:48:02,481 --> 02:48:04,820
mouth open.
Like for the strawberry in his mouth.

3552
02:48:04,821 --> 02:48:06,260
You know,
anderson wants to though.

3553
02:48:07,630 --> 02:48:08,463
Here's the thing,
and you can say that and that makes 

3554
02:48:10,221 --> 02:48:11,054
sense,
but I'm supposed to be down with like 

3555
02:48:12,410 --> 02:48:15,710
the women's movement that says that 
that's an expression.

3556
02:48:15,711 --> 02:48:18,560
That's her expression of her.
But leonard and it is.

3557
02:48:18,561 --> 02:48:19,790
Yes.
But again,

3558
02:48:19,791 --> 02:48:20,624
if you're a professional news caster,
is that really what you want to be 

3559
02:48:24,380 --> 02:48:25,250
presenting?
Well,

3560
02:48:25,270 --> 02:48:28,420
the thing is it didn't exist.
Yeah.

3561
02:48:28,580 --> 02:48:31,970
What hot news caster.
Yeah.

3562
02:48:31,971 --> 02:48:33,440
Well they figured out they can get 
ratings.

3563
02:48:33,441 --> 02:48:34,274
Yeah.
They could get men to pay attention 

3564
02:48:35,840 --> 02:48:36,673
because here's the thing,
the ratings to men that are really into 

3565
02:48:40,161 --> 02:48:42,560
politics are almost entirely unfuckable.

3566
02:48:42,820 --> 02:48:44,630
That's why they get really into 
politics.

3567
02:48:44,700 --> 02:48:46,850
Usually they're married and they're 
like,

3568
02:48:46,851 --> 02:48:47,684
I'm giving up.
And they just stay around out and 

3569
02:48:49,371 --> 02:48:52,790
they're fucking chin starts dropping and
they remember the good old days and they

3570
02:48:52,880 --> 02:48:55,130
watched that fox news and they see 
these.

3571
02:48:56,000 --> 02:48:57,170
They're so hot,
they treat.

3572
02:48:57,360 --> 02:48:58,193
Their wife is yelling at them and shit.
They just ice queens on fox and was a 

3573
02:49:02,660 --> 02:49:03,411
publican.
Yeah,

3574
02:49:03,411 --> 02:49:04,880
that's funny.
They're all the same.

3575
02:49:05,240 --> 02:49:07,770
If you go to that image on the left 
there,

3576
02:49:07,800 --> 02:49:12,340
those have all been women that have done
news on on.

3577
02:49:13,300 --> 02:49:15,080
It's amazing.
The robots a robot.

3578
02:49:15,180 --> 02:49:19,170
It's like it's a real doll factory.
It's really fun and super hot,

3579
02:49:20,830 --> 02:49:21,631
but I get it.
look,

3580
02:49:21,631 --> 02:49:23,700
it's a smart move.
It makes total sense.

3581
02:49:23,701 --> 02:49:25,770
They crushed it.
They crush the ratings Man.

3582
02:49:26,230 --> 02:49:28,080
That I don't know if they do anymore 
really.

3583
02:49:28,410 --> 02:49:31,860
As far as the of the cable news,
I think they're.

3584
02:49:32,010 --> 02:49:32,843
I think they dominate sumner.
I Just read recently that they weren't 

3585
02:49:35,401 --> 02:49:36,960
doing so well anymore.
Really?

3586
02:49:37,430 --> 02:49:39,540
I don't think cable news is doing so 
well anymore.

3587
02:49:39,570 --> 02:49:41,070
Well maybe in the grand scheme of 
things,

3588
02:49:41,071 --> 02:49:46,050
but within the cable news competition,
I think they.

3589
02:49:46,250 --> 02:49:50,400
They dominate.
They find out who got my cable news,

3590
02:49:51,000 --> 02:49:51,833
cable ratings,
fox beat cnn and msnbc combined method 

3591
02:49:57,110 --> 02:49:58,470
guys.
Wow.

3592
02:49:58,730 --> 02:49:59,563
That's the way to do it.
Maybe I should be wearing a laundry 

3593
02:50:01,021 --> 02:50:01,854
during your mom's house.
I wonder if that goes up or down 

3594
02:50:04,711 --> 02:50:05,544
depending on who's president.
Like a wonder is when you have a 

3595
02:50:08,041 --> 02:50:10,920
republican president of cnn gets a bump.
Right?

3596
02:50:11,160 --> 02:50:12,450
Because people are pissed.
Yeah.

3597
02:50:12,600 --> 02:50:13,433
that's probably.
That is probably how it works because 

3598
02:50:15,181 --> 02:50:16,014
people,
fox news thrives on every obama story 

3599
02:50:18,691 --> 02:50:19,530
for sure.
You know.

3600
02:50:19,680 --> 02:50:21,720
But to cnn go deep to do they go with 
the,

3601
02:50:21,721 --> 02:50:24,330
a scantily clad beautIful ladies as 
well.

3602
02:50:24,360 --> 02:50:26,820
No,
I don't watch cnn.

3603
02:50:27,480 --> 02:50:30,000
They have pretty ladies.
They're pretty,

3604
02:50:30,001 --> 02:50:32,660
but it's not like that.
And they have more diverse.

3605
02:50:32,700 --> 02:50:37,700
A couple of basset hounds tooth but they
have a couple of cuties.

3606
02:50:38,070 --> 02:50:39,650
Well we don't have to go over each one.
Yeah.

3607
02:50:40,120 --> 02:50:41,120
But the,
um,

3608
02:50:41,340 --> 02:50:42,173
the thing,
the thing that's odd about it is that 

3609
02:50:43,351 --> 02:50:44,620
had never existed before.
And then they,

3610
02:50:44,621 --> 02:50:46,320
once they figured that formula,
yeah,

3611
02:50:46,600 --> 02:50:49,110
we got,
this is what we do now.

3612
02:50:49,170 --> 02:50:50,940
Yeah.
Ladies and football,

3613
02:50:51,310 --> 02:50:54,090
they're reporting from the ground or 
what exactly.

3614
02:50:54,420 --> 02:50:59,420
super hot and it's kinda like that one 
of the guys.

3615
02:51:00,250 --> 02:51:02,520
There are some really good ones though.
There's some really good reporters.

3616
02:51:03,030 --> 02:51:03,980
Female reporters.
Yeah.

3617
02:51:04,290 --> 02:51:06,180
There isn't an mma to.
Yeah.

3618
02:51:06,560 --> 02:51:08,640
And your and your cameras.
Great.

3619
02:51:08,720 --> 02:51:09,990
Um,
gender trainers.

3620
02:51:10,260 --> 02:51:11,430
Trying to think.
Uh,

3621
02:51:12,350 --> 02:51:13,590
there's a,
there's a few really good ones.

3622
02:51:13,591 --> 02:51:15,900
People they got the hot thing was when.

3623
02:51:15,900 --> 02:51:16,890
Uh,
what's your name?

3624
02:51:16,891 --> 02:51:19,530
Aaron andrews.
She got her.

3625
02:51:19,560 --> 02:51:20,393
They peeped her fucking creeps.
They cut a hole in her fucking hotel 

3626
02:51:24,541 --> 02:51:28,770
room.
Her and like recorded her fucking gross.

3627
02:51:28,820 --> 02:51:29,990
Yeah,
I really fucking.

3628
02:51:31,650 --> 02:51:33,180
She knows her shit though.
She doesn't know.

3629
02:51:33,510 --> 02:51:35,220
She knows her sport.
She knows football.

3630
02:51:35,700 --> 02:51:38,550
It is funny though because when we're 
not football,

3631
02:51:38,551 --> 02:51:39,384
but if you think about politics,
when I said the most people guys that 

3632
02:51:41,551 --> 02:51:42,384
are into politics or unfuckable,
what I mean by that honestly is what 

3633
02:51:44,880 --> 02:51:45,713
they're usually like guys who are 
married and have families have their 

3634
02:51:48,661 --> 02:51:49,494
dads and they worry about their income.
They worried about where their money's 

3635
02:51:52,141 --> 02:51:52,974
going.
It's not like a giant subject of the 

3636
02:51:55,051 --> 02:51:59,760
young single man until trump came along.
Yeah.

3637
02:52:00,300 --> 02:52:05,290
Trump was like one of the first ones I 
noticed like a lot of like young,

3638
02:52:05,291 --> 02:52:08,340
single guys that were really into it.
Yeah.

3639
02:52:08,890 --> 02:52:10,720
What the fuck is that?
What happened there?

3640
02:52:10,730 --> 02:52:13,340
Maybe they grew up with him.
Name recognition.

3641
02:52:13,341 --> 02:52:15,920
He's on that reality show.
No,

3642
02:52:15,940 --> 02:52:17,780
I'm serious.
He's on tv.

3643
02:52:18,320 --> 02:52:19,730
That guy's a reality star.

3644
02:52:19,810 --> 02:52:20,643
I think it's just that he was so outside
of the the the political speak and he 

3645
02:52:25,511 --> 02:52:26,980
was like,
this is ridiculous.

3646
02:52:27,460 --> 02:52:28,293
Shit keeps happening.
I'm going to fucking do just chicks 

3647
02:52:30,830 --> 02:52:32,710
love.
Do you see him mock her?

3648
02:52:32,711 --> 02:52:36,160
Falling down?
Great.

3649
02:52:38,110 --> 02:52:39,820
It is pretty hilarious.
It is,

3650
02:52:40,880 --> 02:52:41,713
yeah.
He even insinuated that she probably 

3651
02:52:42,821 --> 02:52:44,810
wasn't faithful either.
Yeah.

3652
02:52:45,330 --> 02:52:46,163
He just.
He goes for it and that's why he's got 

3653
02:52:48,551 --> 02:52:49,384
the fan trumpeter.
Imitates hillary clinton for stumbling 

3654
02:52:51,251 --> 02:52:53,710
at nine slash 11 memorial questions for 
loyalty to bill.

3655
02:52:53,800 --> 02:52:56,530
Oh my god.
It's so crazy.

3656
02:52:56,550 --> 02:52:57,383
Yeah,
but look at the people behind them 

3657
02:52:58,330 --> 02:53:01,240
clapping.
Actually they're holding up cameras.

3658
02:53:02,350 --> 02:53:03,670
That's a strange thing,
man.

3659
02:53:03,671 --> 02:53:04,504
The device age.
Everyone with the device in their hand 

3660
02:53:06,791 --> 02:53:10,420
and if you look back at photos from the 
19 fifties or sixties,

3661
02:53:10,430 --> 02:53:13,720
like watch the nixon debates with 
kennedy and you look into the audience,

3662
02:53:13,721 --> 02:53:16,150
people are standing there.
You see these people now.

3663
02:53:16,180 --> 02:53:17,013
Everyone has a devIce.
Everyone's capturing in their own 

3664
02:53:19,721 --> 02:53:20,860
device.
I was there.

3665
02:53:21,270 --> 02:53:23,540
I saw when he said that.
He said that outrageous.

3666
02:53:23,910 --> 02:53:24,570
Sure,

3667
02:53:24,570 --> 02:53:27,590
but then you're going to back up that 
video you took on a hard drive,

3668
02:53:27,600 --> 02:53:28,433
right?
To preserve it for the rest of your 

3669
02:53:29,611 --> 02:53:30,000
life.
Like,

3670
02:53:30,000 --> 02:53:32,130
no,
you're just going to delete that video.

3671
02:53:32,380 --> 02:53:35,910
Send it,
send a cnn need to see this.

3672
02:53:36,390 --> 02:53:39,820
Cnn needs to see a video from the source
like no one knows.

3673
02:53:39,840 --> 02:53:40,890
You know?
You never know.

3674
02:53:41,040 --> 02:53:42,660
You never know when like some black 
lives matter.

3675
02:53:42,661 --> 02:53:45,300
People might rush the stage and try to 
take them out yet.

3676
02:53:45,330 --> 02:53:46,290
Right?
Remember that happened.

3677
02:53:46,490 --> 02:53:47,323
There's a bunch of people are screaming 
and yelling at one of his rallies on 

3678
02:53:50,940 --> 02:53:51,773
video.
Yeah.

3679
02:53:51,990 --> 02:53:55,410
It's been so many altercations.
Yeah.

3680
02:53:55,411 --> 02:53:56,244
That's why they're doing it.
I got to see him look without holding 

3681
02:54:01,231 --> 02:54:04,260
something up anymore.
What the fuck do you think happens next?

3682
02:54:04,350 --> 02:54:07,230
That's what we're getting at earlier,
like after these two?

3683
02:54:07,680 --> 02:54:09,000
Yeah,
like what do you got left?

3684
02:54:10,330 --> 02:54:13,810
This is the deep end we're in right now.
Is the deepest deep never sure.

3685
02:54:13,910 --> 02:54:14,910
Right.
For sure.

3686
02:54:15,030 --> 02:54:16,560
The only.
The only good out of it,

3687
02:54:16,561 --> 02:54:17,394
and I'm not being patronizing,
but the only good out of It honestly is 

3688
02:54:20,341 --> 02:54:22,620
we get to see a woman be president.
That's it.

3689
02:54:22,850 --> 02:54:23,940
Yeah.
She's like,

3690
02:54:23,941 --> 02:54:24,774
if she was a man,
she would be thought of as someone 

3691
02:54:27,270 --> 02:54:30,390
deeply entrenched in the system that's 
been proven to be full of shit,

3692
02:54:30,630 --> 02:54:33,300
has been proven to be somewhat option 
and corruption,

3693
02:54:33,750 --> 02:54:34,583
capitalizing on their position to make 
ridiculous amounts of money and there's 

3694
02:54:37,360 --> 02:54:38,193
so much going on there.
Everything that you basically criticize 

3695
02:54:42,600 --> 02:54:45,690
about politicians,
she would fit the bill for that.

3696
02:54:45,870 --> 02:54:46,703
I know you guys.
The next president's going to be 

3697
02:54:48,960 --> 02:54:51,370
nonbinary.
What do you think?

3698
02:54:52,670 --> 02:54:53,930
Well,
I mean we got the black guy.

3699
02:54:53,931 --> 02:54:56,270
We had obama,
now it's the woman's turn.

3700
02:54:56,790 --> 02:54:58,840
Did you see pansexual?
Pansexual,

3701
02:54:58,841 --> 02:55:02,640
and some woman came out as pansexual.
She was the first politician to come out

3702
02:55:02,641 --> 02:55:04,220
as.
See.

3703
02:55:04,340 --> 02:55:05,173
That's my point.
Next is the pan sexual president could 

3704
02:55:07,971 --> 02:55:09,620
be like a gender thing,
pansexual,

3705
02:55:10,750 --> 02:55:12,500
trans president.
I forget what it means.

3706
02:55:12,501 --> 02:55:15,470
All right.
I'll just fucks the whole house.

3707
02:55:15,530 --> 02:55:16,363
Oh,
wow.

3708
02:55:16,520 --> 02:55:18,020
Mary gonzales,
tate's tx,

3709
02:55:18,080 --> 02:55:21,380
Texas state representative identifies as
pansexual in new interview.

3710
02:55:21,440 --> 02:55:23,120
Can we get a look at her?
Look at that.

3711
02:55:23,290 --> 02:55:24,980
Look at that.
And you went with the gender binary.

3712
02:55:24,981 --> 02:55:25,830
Hold on.
I'm looking at right there.

3713
02:55:26,050 --> 02:55:29,210
There are many might describe gonzalez 
orientation as bisexual.

3714
02:55:29,211 --> 02:55:30,460
Pansexual.
Pansexual is.

3715
02:55:30,461 --> 02:55:31,294
Don't believe in a gender binary and 
hence can be attracted to all gender 

3716
02:55:35,061 --> 02:55:39,890
identities.
Let's get a look at Mary Gonzalez.

3717
02:55:40,080 --> 02:55:40,960
Nope,
let's not.

3718
02:55:41,000 --> 02:55:41,780
No,
nope.

3719
02:55:41,780 --> 02:55:43,100
No pictures,
no pictures.

3720
02:55:43,101 --> 02:55:44,570
No.
You don't want to say her name.

3721
02:55:44,860 --> 02:55:45,950
Should have.
Just call her.

3722
02:55:46,850 --> 02:55:48,830
She z.
We don't know.

3723
02:55:48,831 --> 02:55:52,880
We don't know what to call they.
It just.

3724
02:55:52,940 --> 02:55:53,773
If you could get someone from the 19 
sixties and show them the world that we 

3725
02:55:56,871 --> 02:55:57,704
live in today,
the things that people are upset about 

3726
02:55:59,331 --> 02:56:01,430
and the restroom issues.

3727
02:56:01,780 --> 02:56:05,830
I feel like I'm that person.
Like I feel like I'm 40 years old and I,

3728
02:56:05,920 --> 02:56:08,980
I.
the world is so different than the world

3729
02:56:08,981 --> 02:56:09,814
I grew up in in the 19 eighties.
I feel like I'm that old person that's 

3730
02:56:12,341 --> 02:56:13,120
like,
I don't get it.

3731
02:56:13,120 --> 02:56:13,953
I don't get any of this.
Did you know the differences in this 

3732
02:56:16,091 --> 02:56:16,924
age?
This is the first time where people who 

3733
02:56:18,601 --> 02:56:23,110
are sensitive and open minded and 
progressive are going,

3734
02:56:23,111 --> 02:56:23,944
what the fuck are you talking about 30 
now it's gone so far that people who 

3735
02:56:28,091 --> 02:56:31,000
were 100 percent pro gay marriage,
100 percent pro,

3736
02:56:31,001 --> 02:56:32,590
racially quality,
100 percent pro,

3737
02:56:32,591 --> 02:56:34,980
gender equality all across the board.
Check off the things.

3738
02:56:35,290 --> 02:56:36,123
As long as you're not hurting anybody.
I'm 100 percent and you doing whatever 

3739
02:56:37,690 --> 02:56:38,523
you want to do,
but it's gone so far that like there's 

3740
02:56:42,040 --> 02:56:44,270
just so much nonsense.
Yeah,

3741
02:56:44,990 --> 02:56:46,010
I agree.
Meanwhile,

3742
02:56:46,011 --> 02:56:47,750
there's homelessness,
joblessness,

3743
02:56:47,751 --> 02:56:49,730
like all the real issues,
war,

3744
02:56:49,820 --> 02:56:51,110
asteroids,
cancer,

3745
02:56:51,111 --> 02:56:53,640
all this shit that's been around the 
human plagues and.

3746
02:56:53,641 --> 02:56:54,310
And that's

3747
02:56:54,310 --> 02:56:55,960
being resolved.
North Korea has nukes,

3748
02:56:56,080 --> 02:56:57,120
right?
Yeah.

3749
02:56:57,490 --> 02:56:59,170
Guys,
we can all use the same bathroom,

3750
02:56:59,300 --> 02:57:02,590
so we saw that one.
It's really important.

3751
02:57:02,591 --> 02:57:03,630
They're close to neutral,
right?

3752
02:57:03,640 --> 02:57:07,180
Do they have nukes or they have nukes?
Just oh right,

3753
02:57:07,181 --> 02:57:09,380
that it registered.
I was like an earthquake or something.

3754
02:57:09,560 --> 02:57:11,890
Cool.
They fucking detonated in nuke.

3755
02:57:12,240 --> 02:57:14,360
They can do nukes.
Great.

3756
02:57:14,460 --> 02:57:17,410
Homeboys got some swag.
How long before they killed him?

3757
02:57:17,500 --> 02:57:20,920
How are they going to kill him?
That mentality doesn't.

3758
02:57:20,921 --> 02:57:22,600
Does it exist over there?
Rebellion?

3759
02:57:22,601 --> 02:57:24,820
I don't know.
I think somebody else does it,

3760
02:57:24,850 --> 02:57:25,370
but the,
the,

3761
02:57:25,370 --> 02:57:28,750
the question thAt they kill you,
he'll kill you if there's even a murmur.

3762
02:57:29,640 --> 02:57:30,473
Oh yeah.
Kill his uncle killed his uncle right 

3763
02:57:31,631 --> 02:57:33,330
away.
Told his uncle and his uncle's sons.

3764
02:57:33,870 --> 02:57:36,400
So he killed his nephews.
Cousins,

3765
02:57:36,430 --> 02:57:37,263
cousins.
Yeah.

3766
02:57:38,710 --> 02:57:39,730
Yeah.
You don't fuck around dude.

3767
02:57:42,260 --> 02:57:44,240
How crazy is that?
That's today.

3768
02:57:44,270 --> 02:57:46,340
I mean that he's got a whole country 
like that gripped.

3769
02:57:47,170 --> 02:57:49,520
But the thing about a guy like that,
if you killed him,

3770
02:57:49,760 --> 02:57:50,593
what happens next?
Like how do you get those people are 

3771
02:57:53,490 --> 02:57:55,270
there.
So program.

3772
02:57:55,340 --> 02:57:56,690
Well that's the best part.
C,

3773
02:57:56,691 --> 02:58:01,310
we go there and we open up and all of 
garden and we show them coca cola,

3774
02:58:01,360 --> 02:58:02,340
mcdonald's

3775
02:58:02,340 --> 02:58:06,120
and we get to rebuild North Korea.
What do you think?

3776
02:58:06,690 --> 02:58:09,360
We left the south koreans figured out.
Yeah,

3777
02:58:09,440 --> 02:58:13,920
they just take one in to each house and 
separate them from their family.

3778
02:58:14,040 --> 02:58:16,480
North Korea come in like a dog man 
fucked.

3779
02:58:16,680 --> 02:58:17,640
yeah,
take them in.

3780
02:58:17,650 --> 02:58:22,160
Like someone's got to train someone from
another country to whatever.

3781
02:58:22,170 --> 02:58:25,470
Deprogram them like a cult.
Train them from like a puppy.

3782
02:58:25,680 --> 02:58:26,513
Oh yeah.
Did you realize that you could be 40 in 

3783
02:58:30,750 --> 02:58:32,700
North Korea,
come into,

3784
02:58:32,720 --> 02:58:33,553
you know,
sneak into China or something and you 

3785
02:58:35,671 --> 02:58:36,504
don't know anything in this whole world.
You're like a 40 year old infant 

3786
02:58:39,060 --> 02:58:41,190
basically.
You don't know the rest of the world.

3787
02:58:41,520 --> 02:58:43,610
Anything.
Nothing but saying dan,

3788
02:58:43,710 --> 02:58:45,840
why don't we call them like we did the 
middle east,

3789
02:58:45,841 --> 02:58:46,674
like Iraq.
They're so volatile because they have 

3790
02:58:47,940 --> 02:58:52,410
weapons in South Korea.
Like we really like South Korea.

3791
02:58:52,830 --> 02:58:57,090
They make samsung first on cnn,
North Korea may planning october.

3792
02:58:57,091 --> 02:58:59,880
Surprise what?
WHat does that said today?

3793
02:59:00,160 --> 02:59:01,740
Oh jesus,
god,

3794
02:59:02,530 --> 02:59:05,520
what is october surprise?
Like to fuck with our elections?

3795
02:59:09,500 --> 02:59:11,370
I mean,
it's so strange.

3796
02:59:12,240 --> 02:59:14,580
Yeah.
And then you know what?

3797
02:59:14,820 --> 02:59:15,653
It also disturbs me.
So they were so calm about all the 

3798
02:59:19,021 --> 02:59:19,854
conflict and the rest of the world 
because there's not really that much 

3799
02:59:21,931 --> 02:59:22,764
over here,
so we've kind of minimalize it and we 

3800
02:59:24,871 --> 02:59:29,871
concentrate on some other nonsense and 
we fill our face with sugar and the rest

3801
02:59:31,201 --> 02:59:33,900
of the world is embroiled in all these 
battles.

3802
02:59:33,901 --> 02:59:34,734
Like indian Pakistan are right next to 
each other and they fucking hate each 

3803
02:59:37,081 --> 02:59:37,914
other and russia's invading the Ukraine 
and there's all this crazy shit that's 

3804
02:59:41,671 --> 02:59:42,504
going on with them.
And then this putin's almost getting 

3805
02:59:45,211 --> 02:59:47,380
assassinated and,
and we're like,

3806
02:59:47,460 --> 02:59:51,480
I want a latte.
Angelina broke up yet,

3807
02:59:51,830 --> 02:59:52,663
but it's good.
Were isolated geographically till 

3808
02:59:55,800 --> 02:59:57,000
Australia,
Mexico,

3809
02:59:57,001 --> 02:59:58,260
Canada.
That's isolated.

3810
02:59:58,360 --> 03:00:00,830
Australia is the move.
God,

3811
03:00:00,960 --> 03:00:01,793
what we call,
they're going to learn how to talk 

3812
03:00:04,861 --> 03:00:06,390
different though and driving the other 
side of the road.

3813
03:00:06,570 --> 03:00:08,010
That's a really hard.
Yeah.

3814
03:00:08,011 --> 03:00:11,610
They need to fix that in order for us to
colonize.

3815
03:00:11,670 --> 03:00:12,810
Yeah.
Why are you guys on that side?

3816
03:00:14,080 --> 03:00:15,870
Stupid.
It is counter.

3817
03:00:15,871 --> 03:00:17,790
Is there a reason for that?
I mean,

3818
03:00:17,791 --> 03:00:19,860
the logical reason that we don't see as 
americans,

3819
03:00:19,861 --> 03:00:21,240
like the metric system.
Well,

3820
03:00:21,241 --> 03:00:22,074
they got it from england,
england had it because england is so 

3821
03:00:25,261 --> 03:00:26,094
fucking old that back in the day they 
used to ride horses and when you would 

3822
03:00:29,791 --> 03:00:33,510
be like riding,
you would want people that were opposing

3823
03:00:33,511 --> 03:00:36,540
you on your right hand side so you could
hack it them with your sword.

3824
03:00:36,690 --> 03:00:39,150
How the fuck did you know that?
That was really impressive.

3825
03:00:39,780 --> 03:00:42,120
It's not that impressive.
You've looked at up though,

3826
03:00:43,320 --> 03:00:45,390
because most people were right handed or
right handed,

3827
03:00:45,450 --> 03:00:46,283
so you'd want to be on the left hand 
side so you could chop someone's head 

3828
03:00:48,151 --> 03:00:50,010
off for the sword.
That's really good.

3829
03:00:50,230 --> 03:00:51,000
Good.
Yeah,

3830
03:00:51,000 --> 03:00:51,840
makes sense.
Makes sense.

3831
03:00:51,841 --> 03:00:54,210
Over here we grew up,
we realized,

3832
03:00:54,211 --> 03:00:55,044
yeah,
you could Just shoot someone chopped 

3833
03:00:57,450 --> 03:00:59,890
away with a fucking sword.
Throw me back on the right.

3834
03:00:59,950 --> 03:01:00,783
Yeah,
yeah,

3835
03:01:01,080 --> 03:01:02,620
yeah.
They were like pre arrows.

3836
03:01:02,710 --> 03:01:04,240
They figured that out.
That's pretty nice.

3837
03:01:04,290 --> 03:01:06,520
He's figured out arrows yet.
They just had long,

3838
03:01:06,521 --> 03:01:07,354
sharp things.
They hadn't figured out that you could 

3839
03:01:09,070 --> 03:01:11,770
throw things to the air yet.
Crazy.

3840
03:01:12,760 --> 03:01:15,220
Back in the jousting days.
How about catapults?

3841
03:01:15,630 --> 03:01:16,680
Oh,
those Are neat.

3842
03:01:16,681 --> 03:01:17,400
Yeah,

3843
03:01:17,400 --> 03:01:20,630
a giant rock and just pull it back and 
just launch it at peak.

3844
03:01:20,670 --> 03:01:21,830
Well,
you know,

3845
03:01:21,831 --> 03:01:24,140
we watched some documentary on Saudi 
Arabia,

3846
03:01:24,141 --> 03:01:26,120
you know,
are they still crucify people?

3847
03:01:26,270 --> 03:01:28,340
We've seen that one on netflix.
What's it called?

3848
03:01:28,341 --> 03:01:32,480
Genes.
I think it's called Saudi Arabia,

3849
03:01:33,720 --> 03:01:35,180
I think it is.
yeah,

3850
03:01:35,181 --> 03:01:36,210
it's fucked up.
Brutal.

3851
03:01:36,230 --> 03:01:37,063
But they take cameras in and they show 
you what's up and people getting 

3852
03:01:39,951 --> 03:01:42,160
crucified.
Yeah,

3853
03:01:42,170 --> 03:01:43,450
we watched it.
They show you.

3854
03:01:43,540 --> 03:01:44,373
You saw that.
You saw the people getting crazy hang 

3855
03:01:46,171 --> 03:01:46,600
'em up.

3856
03:01:46,600 --> 03:01:47,411
Yeah.
You see,

3857
03:01:47,411 --> 03:01:48,244
um,
uh,

3858
03:01:48,400 --> 03:01:48,881
they,
they,

3859
03:01:48,881 --> 03:01:53,410
they censor stuff but you guys about to 
get to capitate and they blur,

3860
03:01:54,430 --> 03:01:55,263
you know,
guy with a sword just chops his fucking 

3861
03:01:56,381 --> 03:01:57,470
head off.
It's now.

3862
03:01:58,410 --> 03:01:59,380
It's weird.
They were like,

3863
03:01:59,680 --> 03:02:02,560
there's certain parts of those images we
don't want people to see because we know

3864
03:02:02,561 --> 03:02:03,830
they're too disturbing.
It's.

3865
03:02:03,850 --> 03:02:05,080
Yeah,
yeah.

3866
03:02:05,200 --> 03:02:07,720
Do you ever see those isis videos that 
they don't catch on youtube?

3867
03:02:07,960 --> 03:02:08,793
There'll be up for like a couple days 
for someone catches it and I haven't 

3868
03:02:10,811 --> 03:02:12,100
looked in a while,
man.

3869
03:02:12,190 --> 03:02:13,023
I don't like seeing it.
I don't like seeing the Real 

3870
03:02:15,700 --> 03:02:18,640
decapitations and murders as fucking 
disturbing as shit to me.

3871
03:02:18,810 --> 03:02:20,240
Why?
Yeah.

3872
03:02:20,300 --> 03:02:22,640
I saw a few years ago I didn't like 
horrible.

3873
03:02:22,780 --> 03:02:26,080
God did it with a small knife.
Cut this guy's head off a small knife.

3874
03:02:26,081 --> 03:02:27,730
I'm like,
oh yeah,

3875
03:02:27,820 --> 03:02:30,250
but that stays in your head.
That's why I don't like it.

3876
03:02:30,680 --> 03:02:31,513
Yeah.
That's why they want to do it in the 

3877
03:02:32,411 --> 03:02:33,160
first place.
Yeah.

3878
03:02:33,160 --> 03:02:35,680
Yeah.
Just a strange,

3879
03:02:36,100 --> 03:02:37,870
strange thing.
We are people

3880
03:02:38,360 --> 03:02:40,400
drawing and quartering.
Did you ever hear.

3881
03:02:40,401 --> 03:02:41,234
I mean,
you know it goes into that one that's 

3882
03:02:42,141 --> 03:02:45,740
kind of creepy to meet.
It's where they.

3883
03:02:45,860 --> 03:02:48,380
They tie a every year,
arms and your legs,

3884
03:02:48,381 --> 03:02:49,970
right?
They tie them to a horse.

3885
03:02:50,660 --> 03:02:55,660
One horse per limb and I don't think Cut
your intestines like cut your stomach or

3886
03:02:57,291 --> 03:03:01,790
your intestines are open and then they 
send the horses off in all directions.

3887
03:03:01,791 --> 03:03:05,840
There it is,
and then you get ripped limb by limb and

3888
03:03:05,841 --> 03:03:08,930
your intestines get cut out.
Isn't tHat amazing?

3889
03:03:09,180 --> 03:03:10,013
Yeah.
There's a guy in the middle with an ax 

3890
03:03:11,161 --> 03:03:11,994
or a big sore.
Just cut you open while the horses pull 

3891
03:03:14,461 --> 03:03:15,294
you holding

3892
03:03:15,550 --> 03:03:17,590
and this is how they would publicly,
um,

3893
03:03:18,290 --> 03:03:19,180
you know,
the,

3894
03:03:19,470 --> 03:03:20,890
the,
this is a criminal,

3895
03:03:20,920 --> 03:03:22,480
so they're,
they're showing the masses.

3896
03:03:22,481 --> 03:03:23,210
This is going to happen,
happened

3897
03:03:23,210 --> 03:03:24,043
to you if you steal this thing.
I was listening to the other day about 

3898
03:03:27,591 --> 03:03:30,110
the inquisition.
It was fascinating man,

3899
03:03:30,111 --> 03:03:30,944
and it was talking about how everything 
had gotten so crazy that they would try 

3900
03:03:35,800 --> 03:03:36,633
to dig through any means.
THey would try to elicit a confession 

3901
03:03:39,591 --> 03:03:40,424
out of you that you had done something 
that was blasphemous or done something 

3902
03:03:44,030 --> 03:03:48,110
against the lord and they could torture 
you in order to do that.

3903
03:03:48,140 --> 03:03:50,390
They could torture you in order to get 
that confession out of you.

3904
03:03:50,870 --> 03:03:51,703
And they just start torturing people 
just like everybody was guilty and they 

3905
03:03:54,381 --> 03:03:56,220
were just killing people like crazy 
jesus.

3906
03:03:56,230 --> 03:03:57,063
And just listening the accounts of like 
how it all went wrong and how they 

3907
03:04:00,351 --> 03:04:01,730
started doing this.
It was like,

3908
03:04:01,940 --> 03:04:05,390
wow.
Like you could see we want to think that

3909
03:04:05,391 --> 03:04:08,360
in today's day and age that this can 
never happen.

3910
03:04:08,600 --> 03:04:09,800
Like we're past that,
you know,

3911
03:04:09,801 --> 03:04:11,990
we're just too much.
We have too much information.

3912
03:04:11,991 --> 03:04:16,760
We were to evolve or to our culture and 
our civilizations move far too fast,

3913
03:04:16,970 --> 03:04:20,030
but there's spots on earth where it 
hasn't like North Korea,

3914
03:04:20,390 --> 03:04:23,510
you know what their spots on earth where
it hasn't moved past that.

3915
03:04:23,540 --> 03:04:25,380
Like Saudi Arabia,
what you're talking about.

3916
03:04:25,470 --> 03:04:27,570
Well,
it goes well and we still punish people.

3917
03:04:27,571 --> 03:04:30,240
We still kill people.
We just do it behind closed doors in the

3918
03:04:30,241 --> 03:04:33,260
United States.
We may get magnified quite dignified.

3919
03:04:33,261 --> 03:04:33,961
We're still murder.
Yeah,

3920
03:04:33,961 --> 03:04:34,290
and if you.

3921
03:04:34,290 --> 03:04:36,090
I rob somebody.
We make you a slave,

3922
03:04:36,200 --> 03:04:37,590
right?
You're asleep,

3923
03:04:37,660 --> 03:04:39,270
right?
It's just dignified because it's,

3924
03:04:39,290 --> 03:04:42,810
it's in a building that's clean and we 
don't see it.

3925
03:04:42,811 --> 03:04:44,460
You don't Have to see it so it doesn't 
exist.

3926
03:04:44,490 --> 03:04:46,560
Right.
It's still horrific

3927
03:04:46,740 --> 03:04:49,870
though.
We're just,

3928
03:04:50,010 --> 03:04:50,843
we like to think because we can send a 
video through the sky and it arrives on 

3929
03:04:54,541 --> 03:04:55,374
your phone from 50 miles away.
We'd like to think that we're way more 

3930
03:04:59,011 --> 03:05:00,030
advanced.
We really are.

3931
03:05:01,930 --> 03:05:04,110
We're so close to monkeys were so 
goddamn.

3932
03:05:04,280 --> 03:05:05,360
Oh yeah.
I know.

3933
03:05:05,390 --> 03:05:06,223
And you know,
we're on the verge of death all the 

3934
03:05:07,371 --> 03:05:09,140
time.
I had this girl right to me.

3935
03:05:09,170 --> 03:05:12,350
She works separately,
all these jobs around the country,

3936
03:05:12,351 --> 03:05:14,750
around the world to make money like job 
to job.

3937
03:05:14,751 --> 03:05:15,710
And she goes,
I worked in,

3938
03:05:15,711 --> 03:05:16,730
um,
what is it?

3939
03:05:16,731 --> 03:05:18,410
Yellowstone national park.
she goes,

3940
03:05:18,411 --> 03:05:19,244
yeah.
Yesterday somebody fell into a geyser 

3941
03:05:21,080 --> 03:05:25,010
than just disintegrated.
Another person just fell off a cliff.

3942
03:05:25,040 --> 03:05:26,420
They died.
She goes,

3943
03:05:26,421 --> 03:05:29,240
life is so fragile.
That guy got drunk,

3944
03:05:29,241 --> 03:05:29,310
drunk,

3945
03:05:29,310 --> 03:05:33,370
don't want a hundred yards off the trail
and slipped into one of those puddles.

3946
03:05:33,371 --> 03:05:34,151
and they,
they're like,

3947
03:05:34,151 --> 03:05:34,984
dude,
there ain't nothing left like lava and 

3948
03:05:37,571 --> 03:05:38,404
boiling water like happens.
Think about how close to that dude was 

3949
03:05:41,371 --> 03:05:44,110
the dying today that I guy with a beer.
Oh yeah.

3950
03:05:44,300 --> 03:05:45,490
Poof.
Yeah.

3951
03:05:45,550 --> 03:05:46,383
And people are like,
we have to save the barrier is really 

3952
03:05:47,441 --> 03:05:48,274
important.
We'll keep him around to kill more 

3953
03:05:48,941 --> 03:05:49,774
people.
Maybe he shouldn't have been around the 

3954
03:05:52,091 --> 03:05:55,480
baron.
His baby mama bear protects her babies.

3955
03:05:56,210 --> 03:05:58,040
Is there a.
Is there a problem?

3956
03:05:58,080 --> 03:05:58,913
Do we have like a big event?
There's an issue with grizzly bears in 

3957
03:06:01,901 --> 03:06:02,734
the greater yellowstone ecosystem that a
lot of people think that there are too 

3958
03:06:05,711 --> 03:06:08,050
many bears and they want them to see 
classified.

3959
03:06:08,080 --> 03:06:08,913
The environmentalist disagree and they 
say that the bears were brought to the 

3960
03:06:12,281 --> 03:06:14,440
brink of extinction and only through 
diligent work,

3961
03:06:14,441 --> 03:06:15,274
have they been brought back to the 
position where they're at now where 

3962
03:06:17,261 --> 03:06:18,094
they're thriving.

3963
03:06:18,400 --> 03:06:22,870
The problem is super hard to accurately 
estimate hoW many bears there are.

3964
03:06:23,200 --> 03:06:24,010
It's,
it's,

3965
03:06:24,010 --> 03:06:27,070
but you see a lot of them and the people
that are out there all the time,

3966
03:06:27,071 --> 03:06:28,840
the hikers,
the sportsmen,

3967
03:06:28,870 --> 03:06:29,703
meaning the hunters and the fishermen,
they see a lot of them and they're 

3968
03:06:32,351 --> 03:06:33,184
seeing more of them than ever before.
And they're seeing actually less black 

3969
03:06:35,381 --> 03:06:38,020
bears and more grizzly bears,
which is,

3970
03:06:38,021 --> 03:06:39,740
it used to be the opposite.
It's,

3971
03:06:40,540 --> 03:06:43,490
it's a crazY animal man.
We ha.

3972
03:06:43,500 --> 03:06:44,333
I mean,
and brown bears are like the real 

3973
03:06:45,311 --> 03:06:46,180
motherfuckers,
right?

3974
03:06:46,181 --> 03:06:48,460
Aren't they even bigger?
There are super aggressive.

3975
03:06:48,760 --> 03:06:50,140
They're super,
super,

3976
03:06:50,141 --> 03:06:53,080
super Aggressive sometimes.
Sometimes they don't give a fuck.

3977
03:06:53,290 --> 03:06:57,120
Like there's this area,
it's a really spot where there's this,

3978
03:06:57,121 --> 03:06:57,954
um,
this river that runs through Alaska and 

3979
03:07:00,811 --> 03:07:05,130
it's an incredibly common place to see 
grizzly bears to the point where there's

3980
03:07:05,131 --> 03:07:07,920
a video of it where there's like,
jamie,

3981
03:07:07,921 --> 03:07:08,730
how many bears were in it?

3982
03:07:08,730 --> 03:07:13,710
Like 15 bears is like 15 grizzly bears 
in this one area because there's so many

3983
03:07:13,711 --> 03:07:15,210
salmon,
so much salmon,

3984
03:07:15,480 --> 03:07:16,313
and these people are standing around 
filming these grizzly bears because 

3985
03:07:19,861 --> 03:07:20,694
there's so much food for the bears.
The bears never killed people and it's 

3986
03:07:23,341 --> 03:07:26,220
like one of the safest places to observe
bears in Alaska.

3987
03:07:26,280 --> 03:07:28,530
yeah.
They've never had a fatal incident.

3988
03:07:28,531 --> 03:07:30,660
They're like,
bears wander up to people.

3989
03:07:30,690 --> 03:07:33,060
There's one video of this.
Bear is guy's sitting there,

3990
03:07:33,080 --> 03:07:35,730
a launch here looking over at all these.
Yeah,

3991
03:07:35,731 --> 03:07:38,700
that's what it is.
The guys looking over at all these bears

3992
03:07:38,910 --> 03:07:39,743
eating fish and he's sitting in a lawn 
chair and his fucking bear walks onto 

3993
03:07:42,421 --> 03:07:43,950
them.
It is a tanker.

3994
03:07:44,400 --> 03:07:45,233
I mean it's gigantic and it just wanders
up and it's so full and it's just been 

3995
03:07:49,021 --> 03:07:50,880
eating salmon that it's not a threat at 
all.

3996
03:07:50,881 --> 03:07:53,180
It doesn't want to hurt anything.
Just lays down.

3997
03:07:53,250 --> 03:07:54,083
They're not like,
like some animals will fuck you up just 

3998
03:07:56,371 --> 03:07:57,204
for fun,
like some wolves will fuck up like elk 

3999
03:07:59,881 --> 03:08:01,140
and things like that.
Just for fun.

4000
03:08:01,141 --> 03:08:03,490
They call it,
they call it surplus killing or thrilled

4001
03:08:03,500 --> 03:08:05,210
killing.
Look at this video called fullscreen and

4002
03:08:05,211 --> 03:08:06,450
this,
this guy sitting here,

4003
03:08:06,540 --> 03:08:09,240
look at this thing.
This thing just walks up to him.

4004
03:08:11,640 --> 03:08:13,200
I mean he does his lawn chair,
dude.

4005
03:08:13,350 --> 03:08:14,850
I mean,
what to show you?

4006
03:08:14,851 --> 03:08:15,684
How close the guy is.
You'll see it because the bear moves 

4007
03:08:17,941 --> 03:08:19,680
towards him.
Then he asked to start talking to it,

4008
03:08:19,920 --> 03:08:24,870
but this thing is huge.
I mean it's a thousand pounds.

4009
03:08:25,320 --> 03:08:29,370
It's enormous size of it's fucking head.
But watch when it gets close to them,

4010
03:08:29,371 --> 03:08:30,204
that's when you realize how big it 
actually is and the guy has to actually 

4011
03:08:32,521 --> 03:08:35,230
talk to this thing to let them know.
Watch this.

4012
03:08:35,250 --> 03:08:39,450
Here comes right here and this is a 
river and that river right there is just

4013
03:08:39,600 --> 03:08:40,433
overwhelmed at the end of the video.
Get to see what's the name of this 

4014
03:08:42,181 --> 03:08:43,014
video,
jeremy.

4015
03:08:44,140 --> 03:08:44,973
Nice

4016
03:08:45,050 --> 03:08:45,883
bear says next to guy,
but you can look at brooks falls and at 

4017
03:08:49,710 --> 03:08:54,710
this see pictures and stuff.
It just sits down and it gets up.

4018
03:08:55,500 --> 03:08:59,810
God have you go a little further on it 
gets up and the guy has to tell it.

4019
03:08:59,811 --> 03:09:00,920
Yeah,
there it goes guys.

4020
03:09:00,921 --> 03:09:02,790
And tell him to fuck off because it gets
too close to them.

4021
03:09:02,791 --> 03:09:03,624
Yeah.
So it looks at him when they start 

4022
03:09:04,911 --> 03:09:06,980
looking at this mother fucker.
Wow.

4023
03:09:11,500 --> 03:09:11,941
He says,
hey,

4024
03:09:11,941 --> 03:09:12,970
hey.
And it wanders off.

4025
03:09:13,030 --> 03:09:15,160
But now watch when he turns towards the 
river,

4026
03:09:15,280 --> 03:09:19,170
now look at this.
Look at all the shit.

4027
03:09:19,480 --> 03:09:22,550
I kept the camera on that.
Yeah,

4028
03:09:22,690 --> 03:09:25,810
look like,
try to pause it when you do positive,

4029
03:09:25,811 --> 03:09:27,670
like when it goes a little bit further.
Boom.

4030
03:09:27,720 --> 03:09:28,810
So this guy was.
Well,

4031
03:09:28,900 --> 03:09:30,920
he's a photographer.
He sees here there.

4032
03:09:31,140 --> 03:09:31,973
So this is the spot where everybody goes
take pictures of these bears because 

4033
03:09:34,451 --> 03:09:36,790
there's so much salmon.
That's all they eat.

4034
03:09:37,270 --> 03:09:38,103
Oh my gosh.
I guess when bears get into one kind of 

4035
03:09:40,961 --> 03:09:42,880
food,
like they say the bears are also,

4036
03:09:42,910 --> 03:09:45,910
they're safe to be around when there's a
lot of berries because they just say,

4037
03:09:45,911 --> 03:09:46,780
oh,
I'm just eating berries.

4038
03:09:46,960 --> 03:09:49,660
They're not into you will.
They're real omnivores.

4039
03:09:49,970 --> 03:09:52,120
Like they're not necessarily carnivores.
They'll,

4040
03:09:52,150 --> 03:09:54,640
they'll,
they'll just snack on yummy food.

4041
03:09:55,210 --> 03:09:57,760
And if you're the yummy food and that's 
your ass

4042
03:09:57,890 --> 03:09:59,090
that the.
So they eat,

4043
03:09:59,860 --> 03:10:00,693
they eat plants as more than just a ton 
of plans to sustain a thousand pound 

4044
03:10:05,271 --> 03:10:07,140
body feed.
Everything holy,

4045
03:10:07,250 --> 03:10:09,740
their cleanup crew,
they're the cleanup crew for the woods.

4046
03:10:10,160 --> 03:10:11,240
Have anything dies.

4047
03:10:11,980 --> 03:10:13,230
They'll.
They'll fight off wolves.

4048
03:10:13,320 --> 03:10:14,000
Wolves,
a killer.

4049
03:10:14,000 --> 03:10:16,370
Like an elk or something like that.
And the barrel like,

4050
03:10:16,371 --> 03:10:17,230
yeah,
thanks dude.

4051
03:10:17,290 --> 03:10:18,123
I'll just take that shit.
They just wander up to the carcass and 

4052
03:10:19,961 --> 03:10:20,590
just started eating.

4053
03:10:20,590 --> 03:10:23,740
Yeah.
The goddamn thing.

4054
03:10:23,820 --> 03:10:26,710
Or it's not because it's like a 10 times
the size wolf.

4055
03:10:26,800 --> 03:10:28,720
I mean that's really what a what a 
bear's leg.

4056
03:10:29,110 --> 03:10:31,720
Nothing can take down a bear,
right in nature.

4057
03:10:31,930 --> 03:10:33,010
No humans.
The king.

4058
03:10:33,100 --> 03:10:35,770
Only humans.
When humans weren't,

4059
03:10:36,010 --> 03:10:36,843
they actually think there was a thing 
called the short face bear that 

4060
03:10:39,700 --> 03:10:43,090
dominated the bering strait so 
powerfully.

4061
03:10:43,150 --> 03:10:45,100
It was so.
It was such a dangerous animal.

4062
03:10:45,220 --> 03:10:48,940
They think it might have prevented 
people from immigrating to north America

4063
03:10:49,330 --> 03:10:50,163
like buy like thousands of years because
this thing was so dominant that it is a 

4064
03:10:54,731 --> 03:10:55,564
huge aggressive grizzly bear type 
creature that lived during the ice age 

4065
03:10:58,991 --> 03:11:03,070
and it was so dangerous that it kept 
people from speculation.

4066
03:11:03,071 --> 03:11:04,630
But look at the size of the god damn 
thing.

4067
03:11:05,200 --> 03:11:06,033
That's the short face bear.
It's like even bigger than a goddamn 

4068
03:11:08,460 --> 03:11:09,910
grizzly.
Crazy.

4069
03:11:10,580 --> 03:11:11,413
Like,
look at that picture of that fake one 

4070
03:11:12,881 --> 03:11:13,714
right there.
Like that's what it would've looked 

4071
03:11:14,081 --> 03:11:14,400
like.

4072
03:11:14,400 --> 03:11:16,460
Oh my god,
it's a death

4073
03:11:16,510 --> 03:11:18,400
machine.
This is a short face bear.

4074
03:11:18,401 --> 03:11:22,390
Tom is a bear that went extinct.
That was way bigger than a grizzly.

4075
03:11:22,660 --> 03:11:25,090
I mean it was so big.
It was like the hulk.

4076
03:11:25,240 --> 03:11:30,240
The hulk was a bear so crazy that that 
used to be a real thing in north America

4077
03:11:32,020 --> 03:11:34,900
and they think tom was saying that they 
think that that thing.

4078
03:11:34,901 --> 03:11:36,730
Look at it.
It was bigger than a buffalo.

4079
03:11:37,090 --> 03:11:37,923
Those thing woulD take out buffalo's.
They think that they were fearsome 

4080
03:11:40,451 --> 03:11:43,840
predators and they may have prevented 
people from immigrating to north America

4081
03:11:44,050 --> 03:11:49,050
earlier.
What is that thing would die a song die.

4082
03:11:49,220 --> 03:11:50,470
Don't die.
Don't.

4083
03:11:50,620 --> 03:11:52,060
Oh,
jesus christ.

4084
03:11:52,630 --> 03:11:54,760
Oh my god.
That's a real thing.

4085
03:11:55,360 --> 03:11:58,420
What the hell was that?
Diane?

4086
03:11:58,630 --> 03:12:03,250
Dawn.
Terrible teeth on that thing.

4087
03:12:04,900 --> 03:12:06,220
Good lord.
But it's just.

4088
03:12:07,300 --> 03:12:08,260
I mean,
it's kind of.

4089
03:12:08,290 --> 03:12:09,123
I,
I'm so torn on these Kinds of things 

4090
03:12:10,271 --> 03:12:12,310
because I think it's cool that grizzly 
bears are alive.

4091
03:12:12,370 --> 03:12:13,111
Yeah,
that's cool too.

4092
03:12:13,111 --> 03:12:14,110
You can go see him.
Yeah.

4093
03:12:14,590 --> 03:12:17,300
But not if you're that dude that got 
fucked up today face.

4094
03:12:17,350 --> 03:12:19,090
Oh my god.
You hunted a bear.

4095
03:12:19,300 --> 03:12:20,500
Yeah.
Black bears.

4096
03:12:20,530 --> 03:12:21,363
Black bears.
Is that like why you don't really eat 

4097
03:12:24,370 --> 03:12:28,120
brown bears or you can,
but most people don't because they eat a

4098
03:12:28,121 --> 03:12:30,860
lot of carcasses.
So apparently they taste bad.

4099
03:12:32,380 --> 03:12:35,290
Black bears don't.
Blackberries taste good date more.

4100
03:12:35,380 --> 03:12:37,180
Um,
more plants.

4101
03:12:37,220 --> 03:12:39,040
They,
they still eat carcasses.

4102
03:12:39,310 --> 03:12:42,460
They still kill things.
They did do a lot of cannibalism.

4103
03:12:42,850 --> 03:12:45,190
That's the big issue with black bears.
oh,

4104
03:12:45,470 --> 03:12:48,000
I had such animals.
They are.

4105
03:12:49,470 --> 03:12:50,071
No,
I mean,

4106
03:12:50,071 --> 03:12:51,980
you know,
I don't mean as like a corny joke,

4107
03:12:51,980 --> 03:12:55,620
but yeah,
it's males killing lions.

4108
03:12:56,840 --> 03:12:58,760
Lions don't eat them.
Oh,

4109
03:12:58,920 --> 03:13:01,100
just kill them there.
They kill them to keep them from growing

4110
03:13:01,101 --> 03:13:05,660
up and becoming the male competitors.
But the bears do that.

4111
03:13:05,661 --> 03:13:07,640
They think bears are doing it actually 
because they're hungry.

4112
03:13:08,750 --> 03:13:09,583
And also because they think it might be 
able to bring the women back into 

4113
03:13:12,381 --> 03:13:13,660
estrous.
Yeah.

4114
03:13:13,770 --> 03:13:15,080
But that's speculation,
but yeah,

4115
03:13:15,081 --> 03:13:17,350
there's polar bears.
Polar bears are.

4116
03:13:17,620 --> 03:13:21,140
There are 100 percent cannibals,
especially the males.

4117
03:13:21,740 --> 03:13:22,640
Yeah.
There's a.

4118
03:13:22,700 --> 03:13:25,460
I've watched her ecosystem is basically 
shrinking,

4119
03:13:25,461 --> 03:13:27,380
right?
I mean supposedlY,

4120
03:13:27,860 --> 03:13:28,940
but you know what they say?
I mean,

4121
03:13:28,941 --> 03:13:31,050
it's hard to tell who's right because,
uh,

4122
03:13:31,550 --> 03:13:32,383
the wildlife biologists and the people 
who measure bare numbers versus the 

4123
03:13:37,161 --> 03:13:37,994
people who are like animal 
conservationist and mom rights 

4124
03:13:40,071 --> 03:13:40,904
activists,
they disagree on how many polar bears 

4125
03:13:42,621 --> 03:13:45,350
there are and whether or not they're 
healthy populations.

4126
03:13:45,710 --> 03:13:50,710
Because I've read that there's more 
polar bears today than ever that I.

4127
03:13:51,230 --> 03:13:52,220
That doesn't make sense.
Right.

4128
03:13:52,540 --> 03:13:53,960
That doesn't sound right.
No.

4129
03:13:54,440 --> 03:13:55,430
See if that's true.
Jamie,

4130
03:13:58,730 --> 03:13:59,750

03:14:02,691 --> 03:14:03,501

Yeah.

4133
03:14:03,501 --> 03:14:04,400
You guys get you out of there.
Yeah.

4134
03:14:04,500 --> 03:14:05,990
We're going to lose our nanny.
Oh,

4135
03:14:05,991 --> 03:14:08,400
snap candidate.
It's 5:30

4136
03:14:08,400 --> 03:14:09,440
AM.
We didn't go on forever.

4137
03:14:10,800 --> 03:14:13,410
That flew by dude.
We covered a lot of shit.

4138
03:14:14,570 --> 03:14:17,150
We covered everything.
I learned some things.

4139
03:14:17,870 --> 03:14:20,900
I learned about the guy who was the 
financial guy who doesn't give a fuck.

4140
03:14:21,620 --> 03:14:22,453
What else did we learn?
We learn about our proper pronouns and 

4141
03:14:25,010 --> 03:14:26,030
how to use them.
No,

4142
03:14:26,031 --> 03:14:28,520
did we learned about that guy who has 
all the secrets?

4143
03:14:28,521 --> 03:14:32,480
Who fucks kids?
Did 15 months speaker of the house.

4144
03:14:32,530 --> 03:14:34,080
Oh,
speaker dennis has.

4145
03:14:34,670 --> 03:14:39,380
What else?
We learned about a bear talk.

4146
03:14:39,500 --> 03:14:40,333
I feel like we have to have a format.
This show it'd be jerking off to the 

4147
03:14:43,071 --> 03:14:44,330
black guys.
Fucking my wife.

4148
03:14:46,160 --> 03:14:47,900
That was important.
That was important.

4149
03:14:47,901 --> 03:14:50,480
That was important.

4150
03:14:50,481 --> 03:14:52,250

4164
03:15:22,400 --> 03:15:25,040

Really excited about it.
IT's so cool.

4167
03:15:29,590 --> 03:15:32,660
Like when I met you,
you've only been doing comedy like a few

4168
03:15:32,660 --> 03:15:33,080
years,
right?

4169
03:15:33,080 --> 03:15:33,630
I met you in.

4170
03:15:33,630 --> 03:15:35,690
Oh seven.
So I was five years in.

4171
03:15:35,750 --> 03:15:37,170
Yeah.
Was it o seven?

4172
03:15:37,171 --> 03:15:38,690
One zero six.
I think it was.

4173
03:15:38,691 --> 03:15:39,524
Oh,
seven.

4174
03:15:39,810 --> 03:15:42,680
I'm pretty sure it was during the 
maximum bud light.

4175
03:15:42,681 --> 03:15:43,514
Real men of comedy in phoenix.
We met at the hollywood theater theater 

4176
03:15:48,081 --> 03:15:49,170
in the round.
Yeah.

4177
03:15:49,340 --> 03:15:50,610
Fuck.
That was awesome.

4178
03:15:50,670 --> 03:15:51,503
Yeah,

4179
03:15:52,240 --> 03:15:54,830
Yeah.
It's just so cool now to see you.

4180
03:15:54,840 --> 03:15:56,040
You're fucking killing it,

4181
03:15:56,070 --> 03:15:57,300
That's awesome.

4185
03:16:03,240 --> 03:16:04,680

You're really funny.

4186
03:16:05,370 --> 03:16:07,080
Christina.
We need to get one for you.

4187
03:16:07,800 --> 03:16:09,510
Trust me.
It's in the making.

4188
03:16:09,540 --> 03:16:11,340
It's.
We'll see.

4189
03:16:11,520 --> 03:16:13,060
We'll see.
She's um,

4190
03:16:13,740 --> 03:16:17,760
she's doing this.
The Model I did basically like a year or

4191
03:16:17,761 --> 03:16:20,400
two ago where she's going out and doing 
one nighters,

4192
03:16:20,430 --> 03:16:24,270
which I think is because she did helium 
portland one night last week,

4193
03:16:24,271 --> 03:16:29,271
sold out and then seattle one night with
your podcast is so fucking funny.

4194
03:16:29,400 --> 03:16:31,560
You guys have one of the best podcasts 
ever.

4195
03:16:31,650 --> 03:16:33,750
Thanks buddy.
It's so fun to do too.

4196
03:16:33,770 --> 03:16:34,603
It's so,
I mean I've only did it once but it was 

4197
03:16:35,761 --> 03:16:38,090
just such a giggle fest to come on.
We have,

4198
03:16:39,480 --> 03:16:40,313
I'll be happy to.
I could ask about a lot interviews and 

4199
03:16:42,691 --> 03:16:43,524
everything.
I always give credit to you because I 

4200
03:16:44,311 --> 03:16:46,950
remember you being like,
why aren't you doing one?

4201
03:16:47,140 --> 03:16:48,190
It was like,
I don't know,

4202
03:16:48,790 --> 03:16:49,623
and then you saw her and you,
your wife is legitimately funny or you 

4203
03:16:52,471 --> 03:16:54,530
think you guys could just sit there and 
do one?

4204
03:16:54,890 --> 03:16:55,890
And I'm like,
oh no.

4205
03:16:56,330 --> 03:16:58,610
And I told her and She was like,
oh no.

4206
03:16:59,630 --> 03:17:01,830
Now that's all we do.
It's just the two of us.

4207
03:17:02,350 --> 03:17:05,010
We play some clips.
We talked about what's going on and it's

4208
03:17:05,011 --> 03:17:08,070
grown so much in,
in the few,

4209
03:17:08,100 --> 03:17:09,450
you know,
we've been doing it now since 20.

4210
03:17:09,720 --> 03:17:12,000
The end of 2010 is when we started.
It's crazy.

4211
03:17:12,110 --> 03:17:13,980
Wow.
It's been six years.

4212
03:17:13,981 --> 03:17:16,530
Men like six years of.
Of that show.

4213
03:17:16,580 --> 03:17:17,850
Yeah.
I'm at almost seven.

4214
03:17:18,420 --> 03:17:20,430
I'll be seven in december.
I remember.

4215
03:17:20,880 --> 03:17:21,713
I remember watching or reading something
and I realized I didn't want to be your 

4216
03:17:24,960 --> 03:17:26,240
first 10.
Yeah.

4217
03:17:27,330 --> 03:17:28,680
Sat on a couch.
Yeah.

4218
03:17:28,710 --> 03:17:31,170
My office are.
Should fear sold that couch?

4219
03:17:31,530 --> 03:17:33,030
Really?
I gave it to ari.

4220
03:17:34,020 --> 03:17:39,020
We sat on the couch and I gave it to 
somebody was like bay thing and donation

4221
03:17:39,031 --> 03:17:39,791
money maybe.
Yeah.

4222
03:17:39,791 --> 03:17:40,770
Maybe like,
just keep.

4223
03:17:40,771 --> 03:17:41,604
Remember you telling me to like sit up 
on the mic because I was like sitting 

4224
03:17:43,951 --> 03:17:44,701
back.
Oh yeah.

4225
03:17:44,701 --> 03:17:45,534
Well there were,
there were like uncomfortably lean 

4226
03:17:49,441 --> 03:17:51,560
forward on a couch on tommy talking to 
them like,

4227
03:17:51,561 --> 03:17:53,620
oh yeah.
Well we,

4228
03:17:53,640 --> 03:17:55,470
I don't think we had headphones back 
down and we did.

4229
03:17:55,471 --> 03:17:56,304
We didn't.
Maybe I thought you were bananas to 

4230
03:17:57,790 --> 03:18:02,010
doing podcast.
What are you talking about?

4231
03:18:02,011 --> 03:18:05,010
How we go headphones?
Yeah,

4232
03:18:05,670 --> 03:18:06,780
yeah,
yeah.

4233
03:18:08,140 --> 03:18:11,310
I don't know what the fuck possessed me 
to keep doing this.

4234
03:18:13,350 --> 03:18:14,183
Wow.
One of the youth stream podcasts this 

4235
03:18:20,990 --> 03:18:21,823
week.
20.

4236
03:18:22,080 --> 03:18:24,450
Oh my gosh.
Hilarious man.

4237
03:18:25,310 --> 03:18:26,730
Made you.
I never asked you that.

4238
03:18:27,090 --> 03:18:29,760
What did you do?
One or see one where you're like,

4239
03:18:29,800 --> 03:18:32,220
I got to do that.
It was a bunch of shit.

4240
03:18:32,250 --> 03:18:33,083
One of them was doing the opiod anthony 
show because opie and anthony show was 

4241
03:18:35,431 --> 03:18:36,660
just like a hangout.
Right.

4242
03:18:36,661 --> 03:18:39,580
It wasn't like for what?
It didn't have a formula to it.

4243
03:18:39,970 --> 03:18:40,803
It didn't have a format necessarily,
you would come in and a bunch of 

4244
03:18:42,901 --> 03:18:45,870
comments to come in and they'll just 
start talking and it would be hilarious.

4245
03:18:45,871 --> 03:18:46,704
So it'd be a bike,
a bunch of people that knew everybody 

4246
03:18:47,651 --> 03:18:49,270
and we all sit around and just joke 
around.

4247
03:18:49,271 --> 03:18:51,070
It was really fun.
It was a fun hang.

4248
03:18:51,490 --> 03:18:52,323
Then anthony kumina started doing this 
thing called live from the compound 

4249
03:18:55,030 --> 03:18:56,820
where you put up a green screen in his 
basement.

4250
03:18:56,830 --> 03:18:57,663
He had a whole lot professional desk and
professional cameras and he's just a 

4251
03:19:00,461 --> 03:19:01,294
maniac and he would do karaoke holding a
machine gun and he would have a 

4252
03:19:04,481 --> 03:19:06,430
background,
the background and be like manhattan,

4253
03:19:06,431 --> 03:19:07,600
who does change the bat?
And I was like,

4254
03:19:07,601 --> 03:19:09,370
but that would be an amazing thing to 
have.

4255
03:19:09,760 --> 03:19:12,190
And so when he was doIng live from the 
compound,

4256
03:19:12,280 --> 03:19:14,320
he was doing it on one of those 
streaming services.

4257
03:19:14,470 --> 03:19:15,303
So then we started doing the thing.
Me and red band on ustream just started 

4258
03:19:19,931 --> 03:19:21,730
one day.
Well we started doing it on.

4259
03:19:21,970 --> 03:19:26,970
We do it in green rooms first it was 
even pre youtube or pre ustream,

4260
03:19:27,970 --> 03:19:28,803
like we did it in cops.
Remember we did in and joe yelled at us 

4261
03:19:31,511 --> 03:19:32,344
and told us to shut it off.
Fucking fucking thing off your 

4262
03:19:35,570 --> 03:19:37,160
blueberries?
Yeah.

4263
03:19:37,630 --> 03:19:39,340
He didn't even have a phone back then.
yeah,

4264
03:19:39,850 --> 03:19:40,060
yeah.

4265
03:19:40,060 --> 03:19:42,820
He told us to shut it off and that's how
it started.

4266
03:19:42,821 --> 03:19:44,920
We just started doing it that way and 
then it was fun.

4267
03:19:44,921 --> 03:19:45,754
So we started doing it every week and 
then somewhere along the line I just 

4268
03:19:48,671 --> 03:19:52,570
realized it was this way that I can have
these crazy conversations with all these

4269
03:19:52,571 --> 03:19:53,404
interesting people and I could get them 
once I realized there was a certain 

4270
03:19:55,901 --> 03:19:56,734
number of people that were listening,
I could get people to come in and sit 

4271
03:19:58,871 --> 03:20:00,700
down and talk to me.
Do you remember,

4272
03:20:01,380 --> 03:20:02,560
or like early,
early?

4273
03:20:02,980 --> 03:20:04,450
First five.
What kind of,

4274
03:20:05,140 --> 03:20:06,940
how many people were listening to 
something like your show?

4275
03:20:06,970 --> 03:20:08,290
I never looked.
She never looked.

4276
03:20:08,350 --> 03:20:09,510
No.
PuT it up again.

4277
03:20:09,780 --> 03:20:10,613
I never paid taxes.
Every now and then he'd look over the 

4278
03:20:13,181 --> 03:20:16,090
live thing.
It was like 1200 people be watching live

4279
03:20:16,120 --> 03:20:17,960
if it was a good show.
Yeah.

4280
03:20:18,160 --> 03:20:20,780
Yeah.
Sometimes it was only like 500 or $600.

4281
03:20:21,010 --> 03:20:23,020
But um,
yeah.

4282
03:20:23,210 --> 03:20:24,043
But once I had like,
I had like anthony bordain on and you 

4283
03:20:28,230 --> 03:20:29,950
know,
it had a bunch of people like that.

4284
03:20:29,951 --> 03:20:30,784
I was like,
I can talk to some fucking cool people 

4285
03:20:32,411 --> 03:20:34,750
through this thing.
and then it's just like,

4286
03:20:34,751 --> 03:20:36,370
man,
I want to know more about Egypt.

4287
03:20:36,371 --> 03:20:38,050
Let me get John Anthony West on,
hey,

4288
03:20:38,051 --> 03:20:40,840
I want to know more about asteroids.
Let me get randall carlson really become

4289
03:20:40,841 --> 03:20:43,420
just at your interest.
And then graham hancock,

4290
03:20:43,421 --> 03:20:45,640
graham hancock was a big one.
That was the early days when I was doing

4291
03:20:45,641 --> 03:20:46,840
it in my,
in my house.

4292
03:20:47,260 --> 03:20:47,681
And he,
you know,

4293
03:20:47,681 --> 03:20:50,590
he came over my house and we talked to 
like fucking 3:00

4294
03:20:50,591 --> 03:20:53,160
in the morning with his long ass 
podcast.

4295
03:20:53,161 --> 03:20:56,080
It's your biggest get personally for the
show.

4296
03:20:56,600 --> 03:20:58,540
The.
I don't know,

4297
03:20:58,541 --> 03:20:59,740
man.
It's a good question.

4298
03:21:00,040 --> 03:21:01,690
I don't know.
There's no biggest anymore.

4299
03:21:01,780 --> 03:21:04,390
Russell brand was pretty big.
That was pretty interesting.

4300
03:21:04,391 --> 03:21:05,470
Yeah.
He's a fun guy,

4301
03:21:05,471 --> 03:21:06,304
man.
Yeah.

4302
03:21:06,520 --> 03:21:07,480
But.
So I was already laying.

4303
03:21:07,481 --> 03:21:09,250
So it was you.
I love having you on.

4304
03:21:09,270 --> 03:21:10,103
Yeah.
It's like now it becomes like just fun 

4305
03:21:12,680 --> 03:21:16,660
now becomes like,
like joey or bill burr or duncan or

4306
03:21:16,980 --> 03:21:18,990
come stomach was cut open in front of 
the time.

4307
03:21:18,991 --> 03:21:20,910
That was so much blood.
What?

4308
03:21:22,200 --> 03:21:23,110
I got a mega.
Right.

4309
03:21:23,320 --> 03:21:24,580
It just becomes fun.
Right?

4310
03:21:24,581 --> 03:21:25,870
I mean,
don't you guys feel like that?

4311
03:21:26,360 --> 03:21:29,110
It's my favorite thing that we do.
It's the best.

4312
03:21:29,170 --> 03:21:31,200
Do you like it more than standup itself?
No.

4313
03:21:31,840 --> 03:21:32,673
Excuse me.
Standups.

4314
03:21:32,680 --> 03:21:34,800
Always number one,
but the podcast,

4315
03:21:34,810 --> 03:21:37,450
specially since we'd become parents,
it's the one thing that,

4316
03:21:37,480 --> 03:21:40,600
it's the old world,
it's who we were before.

4317
03:21:40,601 --> 03:21:45,601
It's still juvenile and it's the sealed 
hour and a half of just nonsense

4318
03:21:46,190 --> 03:21:48,500
and then we can go back to being 
responsible adults.

4319
03:21:48,860 --> 03:21:49,693
That's true.
That's a good way of putting it because 

4320
03:21:50,541 --> 03:21:53,210
it is.
It's very juvenile and silly,

4321
03:21:53,270 --> 03:21:56,110
but that's why we have a good time just 
being silly on it,

4322
03:21:56,111 --> 03:21:57,130
you know?
Yeah.

4323
03:21:57,140 --> 03:21:57,973
That's the.
That's the big takeaway from your 

4324
03:21:59,151 --> 03:22:02,150
podcast is how silly it is.
You guys just always look.

4325
03:22:02,200 --> 03:22:06,250
It's the least serious thing ever,
you know?

4326
03:22:07,160 --> 03:22:10,750
No serious conversations.
I love black or tom to.

4327
03:22:10,790 --> 03:22:13,100
Yeah,
I need to do that again.

4328
03:22:13,101 --> 03:22:13,934
We got.
The thing is about the move is that the 

4329
03:22:15,621 --> 03:22:19,640
studio is much bigger like actual space.
So we'll have,

4330
03:22:19,690 --> 03:22:20,523
I think some guests again,
because we haven't had guests in a long 

4331
03:22:22,271 --> 03:22:22,850
time.
yeah,

4332
03:22:22,850 --> 03:22:23,683
well you could also,
you could add a bunch of elements to it 

4333
03:22:25,251 --> 03:22:28,660
to once you realize you have all this 
room to do stuff and you know,

4334
03:22:28,910 --> 03:22:30,680
you have like an actual professional 
studio.

4335
03:22:30,820 --> 03:22:31,610
yeah.
No,

4336
03:22:31,610 --> 03:22:33,350
it's exciting.
It's going to be awesome.

4337
03:22:33,380 --> 03:22:34,480
Yeah,
that's reaLly exciting.

4338
03:22:34,580 --> 03:22:36,200
When you guys do it out here,
be happy to do it.

4339
03:22:36,310 --> 03:22:38,180
Oh yeah.
That's a fun fun.

4340
03:22:38,390 --> 03:22:42,260
So for now people can see your podcast.
It's your mom's house.

4341
03:22:42,261 --> 03:22:44,210

4345
03:22:52,551 --> 03:22:55,710

What's that?
That's the,

4352
03:23:09,700 --> 03:23:11,240
the,
the secret group.

4353
03:23:11,300 --> 03:23:12,133
That's a group of promoters,
they actually have a venue I think 

4354
03:23:14,661 --> 03:23:15,494
called that in houston and then.
But the secret group also proMotes

So secret group is going to have her at 
warehouse live venue.

It's a secret,

4360
