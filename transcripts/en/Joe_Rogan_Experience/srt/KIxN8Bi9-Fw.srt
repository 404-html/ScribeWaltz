1
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:13,880
That's my yoga move Hixon gracie and be 
super spiritual.

2
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,650
Nobody does yoga every day.
If you do,

3
00:00:18,651 --> 00:00:20,420
you're a freak.
I had to call Brian.

4
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:21,980
Count out on that.
Brian,

5
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:24,440
does yoga every single day has to be a 
chick.

6
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:25,340
Yeah,
there you go.

7
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:28,010
Not dudes.
Dudes under yoga everyday.

8
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:30,770
Especially regular dudes.
Unless you look at Yoga Guy.

9
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:33,020
I mean there's,
there are guys do yoga everyday,

10
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,870
but that's the thing that dude's like to
say I do yoga every day,

11
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,450
you know,
call them on it.

12
00:00:38,451 --> 00:00:39,630
Yeah.
The same to you.

13
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,970
Well,
I do yoga every day.

14
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:46,200
It keeps you centered.
The Joe Rogan experience podcast is 

15
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,511
brought to you by several things.
The one thing that we can promise 100 

16
00:00:50,241 --> 00:00:55,241
percent when we do commercials for the 
podcast is if we're going to support a 

17
00:00:55,461 --> 00:01:00,461
company,
if we're going to have them as a 

18
00:01:00,461 --> 00:01:00,461
sponsor,
they have to be cool there.

19
00:01:00,461 --> 00:01:01,190
There has to have a good business model.

20
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:06,190
They have to,
they have to be something that makes 

21
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:06,190
sense for us.
And uh,

22
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:08,480
that's one of the reasons we are 
sponsored by kerosene games.

23
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:14,320
And um,
what we decided to do with kerosene 

24
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,381
games is to take a chance to endorse a 
startup company that is making really 

25
00:01:17,571 --> 00:01:22,571
fucking cool video games and they're 
making them for the IPAD and the iphone 

26
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,880
and now in February will be android 
phones as well,

27
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,970
but the,
they're making specifically for that and

28
00:01:28,971 --> 00:01:30,860
they're just really nice,
cool,

29
00:01:30,861 --> 00:01:33,080
fun games.
Whereas a lot of times,

30
00:01:33,081 --> 00:01:35,540
like when you buy video games for the 
IPAD,

31
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,840
a lot of times they're a ported over 
from the PC whereas kerosene games is 

32
00:01:41,091 --> 00:01:44,610
making all their games.
They're making them directly for these.

33
00:01:44,611 --> 00:01:48,500
So with intuitive touchscreen controls 
the graphics of bad ass.

34
00:01:48,501 --> 00:01:50,210
And you see Brian is fucking with it 
right now.

35
00:01:50,211 --> 00:01:52,880
It's really addictive game.
If you've got,

36
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:55,430
it's not use a video of someone playing 
it is a clone.

37
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,240
Oh no,
that's crazy.

38
00:01:57,241 --> 00:01:57,500
I think.
Yeah,

39
00:01:57,501 --> 00:01:59,910
they were made from the ground up,
see amazing control.

40
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:01,460
So you already have a video of you 
playing it?

41
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:02,140
No,
this is,

42
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:03,940
I just go on Youtube.
There's a lot of it,

43
00:02:03,941 --> 00:02:08,941
like if you want to look around,
there's a lot of videos of people 

44
00:02:08,941 --> 00:02:09,560
playing this on Youtube.
There's really good reviews and there's,

45
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:14,650
you know,
there's a lot of tips and secrets of 

46
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:16,840
you're stuck somewhere.
You can just go to youtube and find out 

47
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:16,840
a lot of stuff.

48
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,710
Yeah.
This is like a really high end game.

49
00:02:17,711 --> 00:02:21,340
It's fucking cool to play.
It's really great graphics.

50
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:23,200
It's,
we live in strange times.

51
00:02:23,201 --> 00:02:28,201
Folks in that little skinny ass piece of
glass and plastic and innards can do 

52
00:02:28,201 --> 00:02:30,610
some amazing shit when it comes to 
graphics processing.

53
00:02:30,611 --> 00:02:32,860
So the imagery that you can get is 
really,

54
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,570
really high resolution and cool and uh,
to just addictive really,

55

62
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,950
like dealing with them and we liked 
their business model.

63
00:02:53,951 --> 00:02:58,951
That's very reasonable price.
They've invested a lot of money making 

64
00:02:58,951 --> 00:03:00,810
this game and they did a great fucking

and thanks to all other people that have
been doing a positive reviews on that 

68
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:11,760
game in the APP store that's really big 
for this company if you'd like.

69
00:03:11,761 --> 00:03:13,920
Right.
Like reviews and and you know,

70
00:03:13,921 --> 00:03:16,710
and stuff like that for them because 
that just like podcasts,

71
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:18,530
every time you write a review and rate 
it,

72
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,970
it helps them out and it also shows 
that,

73
00:03:20,971 --> 00:03:25,971
you know,
this podcast is helping them out and so 

74
00:03:25,971 --> 00:03:25,971
that's good for us to be like,
look,

75
00:03:25,971 --> 00:03:26,580
look what we were doing.
Do you guys were helping you out here?

76
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:28,140
So it helps everybody out.
So

77
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:29,180
yeah,
it really does.

78
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:34,240
We appreciate that.
This one of the coolest things of this 

79
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,110
podcast is sort of brought about is this
real sense of community that,

80
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:42,340
I mean we,
we had a community amongst ourselves 

81
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:43,430
before his friends but there's this 
whole community of other people that are

82
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:48,431
like minded that do cool shit like that.
We really appreciate the fuck out of 

83
00:03:48,431 --> 00:03:50,030
that.
And that's why one of our other sponsors

84
00:03:50,031 --> 00:03:53,720
is hover.
Hover is the same people that own ting,

85
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:58,590
which is a great cell phone company that
we endorse because they're,

86
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:00,410
they,
they have no contracts,

87
00:04:00,411 --> 00:04:02,570
you can cancel anytime you want and they
have high end phones.

88
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:04,940
It's very reasonably priced and on the 
sprint backbone,

89
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:09,440
well they also have a company called 
hover and what they're trying to do with

90
00:04:09,441 --> 00:04:12,460
hover is basically kind of do the same 
shit that they do with,

91
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:15,860
with Tim that trying to give you a great
service,

92
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,580
uh,
with,

93
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:17,510
uh,
with,

94
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:18,490
with.

95
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:23,500
It's easy to manage with excellent 
software and they're trying to do it 

96
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,790
ethically so they make it so that it's 
really easy to use.

97
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:31,090
They have,
they take the hassle of owning and 

98
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:31,820
managing domain names with smart,
easy to use friction free,

99
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:36,890
powerful domain name management tools.
So lives the way they have it set up.

100
00:04:36,891 --> 00:04:40,550
It's very nice.
They're like a real easy going company.

101
00:04:40,551 --> 00:04:43,970
They're not the,
there's no crazy hard sell.

102
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,110
They don't believe in hiding 
functionality or requiring extra payment

103
00:04:48,111 --> 00:04:50,720
for things that should be included in 
the domain name management.

104
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,650
Things like who is privacy and Brian,
we were talking about that like that's a

105
00:04:54,651 --> 00:04:57,380
big thing,
like who is privacy you want,

106
00:04:57,390 --> 00:05:02,390
you know,
if you have suck my cock fatty 

107
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:04,911
[inaudible] dot com.
And then someone comes along and was 

108
00:05:04,911 --> 00:05:05,070
like who's this sick prick?
And they,

109
00:05:05,071 --> 00:05:07,220
they,
they find out that it's,

110
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,000
you know,
you go to that.

111
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,110
Who is,
who owns that?

112
00:05:09,111 --> 00:05:12,710
Oh well it's brian red band.
He likes fat checks.

113
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:14,390
Blown them.
Or is it fact dudes?

114
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,970
You know,
who the fuck would call a woman fatty?

115
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:19,700
That's so rude.
That's not just sexist,

116
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:21,770
it's,
you're a rude person.

117
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,140
Call one more fatty.
So it's probably gay.

118
00:05:24,141 --> 00:05:26,930
So it was talking about eight guys and 
you know,

119
00:05:26,931 --> 00:05:29,010
if that's your thing,
it must be someone's things.

120
00:05:29,011 --> 00:05:31,850
Someone out there must own.
Suck my cock.

121
00:05:31,851 --> 00:05:33,310
Fatty.com.
They must,

122
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:38,311
it's been thought up already.
They probably sat down and bought every 

123
00:05:38,311 --> 00:05:39,140
fucking domain name you could ever come 
up with.

124
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:42,010
So if it's cool,
it's like if you type in a name,

125
00:05:42,011 --> 00:05:43,030
like I said,
like you want a,

126
00:05:43,031 --> 00:05:48,031
you know Joe Rogan farts.com
and it shows you if it's available also 

127
00:05:48,031 --> 00:05:50,230
gives you like,
like a bunch of suggestions like that.

128
00:05:50,231 --> 00:05:55,231
So you can kind of like,
oh I didn't even think of that domain 

129
00:05:55,231 --> 00:05:55,231
name.
But one of the other cool things is that

130
00:05:55,231 --> 00:05:58,000
there's also domain nowadays a lot of 
people buy and they're like,

131
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:59,540
ah,
I'm just going to sit on this,

132
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:04,900
but you know,
if somebody offers me this much money 

133
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,971
I'll give it to them.
And so they also have that on the 

134
00:06:06,971 --> 00:06:09,311
website.
So like you can come here and look at 

135
00:06:09,311 --> 00:06:09,610
some websites that you're like wow,
I could buy that for you know this.

136
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:11,120
But here,
here's a game.

137
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:12,840
Try to guess how much this.
Here's one.

138
00:06:12,841 --> 00:06:17,400
It's $8,000.
Let's see what the name or what domain.

139
00:06:17,401 --> 00:06:20,270
That $8,000.
Td Crew Dot com.

140
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:25,300
Somebody selling kidding crew is spelled
with a k $4,000.

141
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:27,210
We got

142
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:31,700
what the fuck?
That is really cool software though.

143
00:06:31,701 --> 00:06:36,701
Like say if there is someone who has one
and it's the name of your company and 

144
00:06:36,701 --> 00:06:38,390
you can get it for a couple thousand 
bucks or whatever it is,

145
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:38,850
you know,
you.

146
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:39,740
Yeah,
I mean,

147
00:06:39,741 --> 00:06:42,020
you save yourself a lot of hassle.
So,

148
00:06:42,021 --> 00:06:42,510
uh,
that,

149
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:45,080
that's cool.
And it's the same sort of thing.

150
00:06:45,081 --> 00:06:50,081
It's a company that they're,
they're trying to do things ethically 

151
00:06:50,081 --> 00:06:54,581
and they're trying to do things in a way
that provides you with great service as 

152
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:55,610
well.
And they think that that's possible.

153
00:06:55,611 --> 00:07:00,611
They think that's possible with they're 
showing it's possible and it's showing 

154
00:07:00,611 --> 00:07:00,810
it's possible with hover as well.
Um,

155
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:02,730
so if you,
um,

156
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:08,210
go to a hover.com
forward slash rogen,

157
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:10,640
what do you do?
Save money off your domain registration?

158
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:11,780
Yeah.
You save a,

159
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:14,810
I believe it's 10 percent off your,
uh,

160
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:17,270
whatever you get.
So it's a,

161
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:19,160
and I'm just guessing.
Yeah,

162
00:07:19,161 --> 00:07:21,820
well they have that big 10 percent thing
going on with you,

163
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:22,830
you know?

164
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,250
Yeah,
I'm big on temperature.

165
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,100
If you go to Hubbard.com
forward slash Rogen,

166
00:07:27,101 --> 00:07:29,590
you will get 10 percent off your domain 
name registrations.

167
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:31,720
So Brian is correct.
I,

168
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:33,580
I'm,
I'm unorganized,

169
00:07:33,581 --> 00:07:36,470
ladies and gentlemen,
I have my notes here and they're fucking

170
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:39,910
scattered all over the board,
but what I do know what I can tell you,

171
00:07:39,911 --> 00:07:44,911
it's fucking cool company run by cool 
people and support them because they're 

172
00:07:44,911 --> 00:07:46,900
a,
they're doing things and what we believe

173
00:07:46,901 --> 00:07:51,901
is a,
an ethical way and they're providing a 

174
00:07:51,901 --> 00:07:51,901
great service as well.
They know what the fuck they're doing.

175
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:53,560
We're also brought to you by [inaudible]
dot com.

176
00:07:53,561 --> 00:07:57,490
It's o,
n n I t I wish I didn't have to say that

177
00:07:57,491 --> 00:08:00,070
every week,
but there is a regular on it.com.

178
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:05,290
There is an o,
n I t dot don't go there and you know 

179
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:06,340
nothing you can do about that.

180
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:07,520
Bad.
Too Bad.

181
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:10,040
Like no one makes like an honor song for
you guys.

182
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:15,041
You like based on like you know things.
Please don't ask for that because I 

183
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:18,950
didn't create it.
I would not play it for the hawks.

184
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:24,040
The hell you know it would snow.
No one's gonna make good on audit song.

185
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:25,830
Yeah.
You heard the Olive Garden Buffalo Song.

186
00:08:25,831 --> 00:08:29,450
People did exactly what I just said.
No one's going to make a good song.

187
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:30,370
Crazy.

188
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,580
Fuck.
Oh,

189
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,500
what are,
uh,

190
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:36,220
what we all believe to be good.
Everybody has their own sort of level.

191
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:38,390
Dr Lazar,
by the way,

192
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:43,940
I think it's bizarre.
Dr Azar as the neurosurgeon is talking 

193
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:44,630
about the benefits of taking Alpha 
brain.

194
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:45,410
Um,
we're,

195
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:49,160
we're currently rubbing running this 
double blind placebo,

196
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,590
uh,
experiment.

197
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:54,900
You guys had been there for two years,
is they have to take it.

198
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:55,890
They take it for a year,

199
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:58,620
which it sounds crazy and it costs a lot
of fucking money.

200
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:01,150
But what's important is if you go to the
site,

201
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:06,180
there's a science page on [inaudible] 
dot com explains all the different 

202
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:10,190
ingredients that have been shown in 
clinical trials to improve memory to,

203
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:15,820
to the idea is that they improve 
cognitive function by providing your 

204
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:20,451
neurotransmitters with all the building 
blocks and the nutrients that it needs 

205
00:09:20,451 --> 00:09:21,450
in order to think the best.
I'm a,

206
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:26,590
I'm a huge believer of talked about this
on the podcast and lean times and I've 

207
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:28,770
talked to a lot of people after shows 
and they've told me how much it's helped

208
00:09:28,771 --> 00:09:33,771
them and how much it inspired them 
because I'm a big believer in it sounds 

209
00:09:33,771 --> 00:09:37,911
so obvious,
but I'm a big believer in putting 

210
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:40,071
healthy shit into your body.
I mean occasionally enjoy a cocktail or 

211
00:09:40,071 --> 00:09:41,880
two or a fucking steak and cheese sub or
you know,

212
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:44,340
I mean I'm not a,
I'm not a saint when it comes to that,

213
00:09:44,341 --> 00:09:49,341
but I do eat a lot of nutritious food 
and I think it's really important for 

214
00:09:49,341 --> 00:09:49,341
you to do the same.

215
00:09:49,341 --> 00:09:52,680
If you want your body to really work at 
an optimum level,

216
00:09:52,681 --> 00:09:57,681
in my opinion,
the only way to do it is to feed it 

217
00:09:57,681 --> 00:10:01,790
nutrient rich foods like vegetables,
Kale and a lot of green vegetables,

218
00:10:03,661 --> 00:10:06,000
drink a lot of fucking water,
don't just drink a little bit,

219
00:10:06,001 --> 00:10:08,370
drink a lot,
take multivitamins,

220
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:13,460
and there's other supplements that you 
can take that will have a positive 

221
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:14,360
effect on the way your body functions 
and,

222
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,740
and to me,
that's what it's all about.

223
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:22,070
I ain't mad,
I'm all about my brain functioning on 

224
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:22,070
the highest level.
I can get it to my body,

225
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:27,021
functioning at the highest level I can 
get it to and that's what we're all 

226
00:10:27,021 --> 00:10:28,890
about it on it.
Everything that we sell is either trying

227
00:10:28,891 --> 00:10:33,891
to improve your immune system or trying 
to improve your memory or your 

228
00:10:33,891 --> 00:10:38,130
cardiovascular endurance or with hemp 
force that has Makkah and raw cocoa.

229
00:10:38,131 --> 00:10:43,110
Your recovery and with antioxidants in 
it protect you against free radicals.

230
00:10:43,111 --> 00:10:45,690
We sell coconut oil and killer bee 
honey.

231
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:51,020
Everything we sell,
it's just designed to make your body 

232
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:52,530
performed best.
It's the best shit we can find.

233
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,870
We guarantee you were we.
If we.

234
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:57,930
If we know about any cooler shit,
we'll try to sell that to.

235
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:00,800
Well,
I when you search Alex Jones on on it,

236
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:01,760
like I just tried to search

237
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:04,740
Joan's going to become a representative 
of audit.

238
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:07,950
Finding a new world order with vitamins.
Is He really?

239
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:11,850
The government doesn't want you to have 
vitamins because the elites are the only

240
00:11:11,851 --> 00:11:13,260
ones who want to have a good memory

241
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:16,500
and it could laser not find his 
name.com.

242
00:11:16,501 --> 00:11:20,760
So he had to run a laser but it was 
already taken.

243
00:11:20,761 --> 00:11:23,310
So He'd got the [inaudible] with a z 
just like that.

244
00:11:23,311 --> 00:11:24,850
Other kiddies.
Good

245
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:29,870
move if Dr Lazaro,
but it's like a famous character and 

246
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:32,891
like a Batman comic book or something 
like that to change your name to Dr 

247
00:11:32,891 --> 00:11:32,891
Lazaro.
There'll be kind of clutch.

248
00:11:32,891 --> 00:11:35,900
But the only other Lasar that I've ever 
heard of is that guy,

249
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:40,950
um,
that was the man who claimed to be an 

250
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:41,450
area 51.
Have you ever heard of him?

251
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:45,110
Robert Lasar.
Bob was our and he's the guy who claimed

252
00:11:45,111 --> 00:11:50,111
to be a man who was hired to back 
engineer Ufos and area 51 and it was 

253
00:11:51,861 --> 00:11:56,861
proven that he's at least full of shit 
about is education of the Stanton 

254
00:11:56,861 --> 00:11:56,890
Freedman,
I believe,

255
00:11:56,891 --> 00:12:01,891
who actually wants to do the podcast 
when I get him on who is the probably 

256
00:12:01,891 --> 00:12:05,791
the leading guy when it comes to a Ufo 
and flying saucers and what,

257
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:11,480
you know,
what the possibilities of space travel 

258
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,831
could be this guys.
But like I think he's like a nuclear 

259
00:12:13,831 --> 00:12:14,440
physicist or something wacky and he's 
been studying this shit forever,

260
00:12:14,441 --> 00:12:19,441
but he absolutely believes that we've 
been visited by ships from other 

261
00:12:19,451 --> 00:12:24,070
galaxies and he says there's proof and 
we're going to get him on and we're also

262
00:12:24,071 --> 00:12:29,071
working to get Steven Greer on who's the
guy who's the head of the disclosure 

263
00:12:29,071 --> 00:12:29,470
project.

264
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:34,890
We're hoping to get him on it.
It looks like some time in February and 

265
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:37,450
the disclosure project was like a bunch 
of different fucking scientists and they

266
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:42,480
uh,
military people and they all got 

267
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:42,950
together and the all talked about their 
ufo experiences in,

268
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:47,970
in great depth and some of them are very
compelling to really interesting stuff.

269
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:51,500
And we're going to have him on the 
podcast as well.

270
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:54,130
Bitches.
We move forward.

271
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,010
Get yourself some upgraded coffee.
I'm drinking it right now.

272
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,500
This is bulletproof coffee.
I make this shit with butter.

273
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:01,360
Ian Edwards.
Do you know what I'm talking about?

274
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:04,300
Raw butter.
I take raw butter as opposed to what?

275
00:13:04,301 --> 00:13:09,301
Cook butter.
I take butter from grass fed cows and I 

276
00:13:09,301 --> 00:13:11,710
blend it with the coffee and something 
called mct oil.

277
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:14,860
That's how you make bulletproof coffee.
You want some next level shit.

278
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:15,440
Next level.

279
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:20,510
Just when I think I'm healthy,
she didn't make me feel we're taking 

280
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:20,510
this shit.
No,

281
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:21,580
you body's good dude.
You know?

282
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:25,230
How silly would it sound if you talk to 
somebody from the 19 twenties gone,

283
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:26,650
no,
this is grass fed,

284
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:31,980
but they're like,
you got some other type of butter.

285
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:37,550
Yeah.
Be Looking at what the fuck you talking 

286
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:37,550
about stupid.
Are you okay?

287
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:37,550
Do you need to sit there on this rock?

288
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:38,850

296
00:14:00,231 --> 00:14:04,080
that we find effective and that we think
is something that we would want to buy.

297
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:09,350
So that's the whole concept behind it.
It's definitely not to rip anybody off 

298
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:10,650
A.
I've said that too many times.

299
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:13,260
It sounds almost insincere,
but it's true.

300
00:14:13,261 --> 00:14:14,820
Shit bitches.
All right,

301
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:18,390

Use the code name.

O n n I t hollow

00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:27,870
Joe Rogan Experience

305
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:30,950
Joe Rogan podcast by night.

306
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:35,270
Right before podcasts.
Edwards.

307
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:37,830
I popped out for those bad pitches.

00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:43,300
Ian To getting healthy my phone during 
the podcast too.

309
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:46,360
Do you know how to,
you know Joe over here?

310
00:14:46,361 --> 00:14:47,920
Ian Edwards.
Man,

311
00:14:47,921 --> 00:14:51,790
I've known you for probably as long as 
any comedian that I,

312
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:52,070
that

313
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:53,360
I'm friends with.
Oh Shit.

314
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:56,570
I've known you for a long time man.
We met at Boston.

315
00:14:56,571 --> 00:14:59,680
Comedy was at Boston comedy in the 
village and the village man.

316
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:02,990
Where's third?
Was that like 1990 or some shit?

317
00:15:02,991 --> 00:15:04,170
What was that?
It was,

318
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:07,160
it was in the nineties.
It's fun talking about,

319
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:08,060
uh,
you know,

320
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:10,700
reminiscing about the early days of 
comedy.

321
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:14,600
It's one of the only times that you 
don't feel like you're talking about the

322
00:15:14,601 --> 00:15:16,160
glory days.
So like,

323
00:15:16,161 --> 00:15:21,161
you know,
we hear dude talking about like college 

324
00:15:21,161 --> 00:15:21,161
football,
career,

325
00:15:21,161 --> 00:15:24,910
a lot of times like a ride already will 
you shut up about your fucking football 

326
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:28,481
career.
But I love hearing stories like about 

327
00:15:28,481 --> 00:15:29,600
the early days,
like from everybody.

328
00:15:29,601 --> 00:15:33,500
I love hearing them from Chris Rock.
I love hearing them from Jerry Seinfeld.

329
00:15:33,501 --> 00:15:36,550
I love hearing them from Rodney.
I just love those stories

330
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:38,380
man.
I love him too man.

331
00:15:38,381 --> 00:15:43,381
Like,
like one thing I used to do as a comic 

332
00:15:43,381 --> 00:15:44,200
was hanging out with older comics.
Go to diners at night.

333
00:15:44,201 --> 00:15:46,390
I have to show up and just to listen to 
them.

334
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,490
Yeah.
And you go eat and Carnegie data,

335
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:53,040
they'll tell you who used to eat there 
and just just all the stories man.

336
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,390
Big like comedy story person.

337
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:57,270
Yeah.
When you get to go on the road,

338
00:15:57,271 --> 00:16:02,271
like one of the coolest things when you 
first start out as you get to go on the 

339
00:16:02,271 --> 00:16:03,740
road with a real veteran,
someone who's got some good stories,

340
00:16:03,741 --> 00:16:05,490
you can tell you some crazy shit about,
uh,

341
00:16:05,491 --> 00:16:08,200
other dudes that did this and that dad.
And he showed up.

342
00:16:08,201 --> 00:16:11,310
It was on heroin.
And the owner told him to put your pants

343
00:16:11,311 --> 00:16:14,560
on and pushed them on the stage and he 
fucking killed somewhere.

344
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:16,960
It's like classic rock and roll stories.
But for comedy.

345
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:18,860
Yeah.
Well

346
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,140
yeah.
You and you and I kind of lived those.

347
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:24,250
That Boston Comedy Club was a fun spot.
Is that still this?

348
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:25,620
Nah,
it's a,

349
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:27,770
it's like an upscale kind of bar right 
now.

350
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:32,270
But it used to be like an addict,
like a snow large,

351
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:37,540
like a large,
like they kind of had a fireplace on 

352
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:37,820
stage.
It was a place.

353
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:40,250
It was a weird little spot because a 
weird little spot,

354
00:16:40,251 --> 00:16:43,310
but it was perfect.
You had it only seated like what?

355
00:16:43,311 --> 00:16:46,100
Like 80 people or something.
How many people could get in there?

356
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:48,830
Maybe 100,
maybe 100 years.

357
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:51,440
Stuff to share that place to get 100 
people in there.

358
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:55,280
But man,
we had so much fun at that place is fun.

359
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,170
We just used to hang man.
And uh,

360
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:02,560
we saw some great short.
We saw like we saw shit we took for 

361
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:02,560
granted,
you know,

362
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,830
is a,
you should see Jim Breuer,

363
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:05,390
Tony Woods,
Chappelle,

364
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:10,340
read Johnny the Round Guy,
like just a bunch of killers and killers

365
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:13,220
to kill us telling people don't know 
about Tony Woods.

366
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:18,350
Tony Woods is funny as fuck.
He was always really strong.

367
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:21,770
I know he's one of those dudes like I've
talked about before.

368
00:17:21,771 --> 00:17:23,060
Reggie Mcfadden's,
another one.

369
00:17:23,090 --> 00:17:27,110
I don't understand how reggie mcfadden 
isn't like Kevin Hart,

370
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:27,790
right?
Yeah.

371
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,810
Reggie.
It's kind of crazy.

372
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:34,870
Yeah,
but I've seen crazy people make it 

373
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:35,030
before so it's still a valid question.
Right.

374
00:17:35,031 --> 00:17:38,180
Crazy Safari.
Ms Dot Manche or something.

375
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:41,600
When I saw reggie mcfadden in 19,
like run time.

376
00:17:41,601 --> 00:17:44,510
I met you in 1990.
He worked at.

377
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:49,440
He did a spot at a place in new Rochelle
called the champagne comedy club.

378
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,900
I couldn't work there because I was 
dirty.

379
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:57,190
Dude did not allow any dirty comedy.
Nothing that you had to give you a 

380
00:17:57,190 --> 00:18:00,561
speech before you worked there.
He would say no motherfuckers who was 

381
00:18:00,561 --> 00:18:02,370
real serious,
like he put his finger up and he goes,

382
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:06,070
you don't say the bitch had a big ass.
You say the woman had a while back.

383
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:08,770
I'm not joking.
He had,

384
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:15,050
he had rules.
I mean it was the champagne comedy club 

385
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:16,170
and he was trying to make it very 
upscale,

386
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,730
you know,
and some of my friend John,

387
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:21,270
uh,
open for Reggie and he had a respectable

388
00:18:21,271 --> 00:18:22,140
set,
you know,

389
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:27,330
but Reggie without a swear with real was
no bad language too strong.

390
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,170
I mean he destroyed.
I was watching him.

391
00:18:31,171 --> 00:18:32,820
I was like,
I'm watching the next Eddie Murphy.

392
00:18:32,821 --> 00:18:34,350
I'm like,
this guy is going to be gigantic.

393
00:18:34,351 --> 00:18:35,790
You can't stop this.
I'm like,

394
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:37,320
this is the kind of talent you can't 
stop.

395
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:39,070
Right.
And he was the one that,

396
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,860
that what if,
for whatever reason,

397
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:45,890
when you say the word regiment fat and 
there's a few comedy fans who know who 

398
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:47,180
he is or he's not.
He's not like Kevin Hart is or like,

399
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:52,220
you know,
and no disrespect to Kevin Hart who I 

400
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:52,220
think it's hilarious.
I'm not,

401
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:52,220
I'm using this as an example because 
he's really good.

402
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:54,120
Just trying to show people how funny.
Reggie.

403
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:57,140
Reggie.
Fucking amazing.

404
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,470
He would erase your performance.
Who would destroy?

405
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:02,420
Who was the guy that went on?
I don't know.

406
00:19:02,421 --> 00:19:03,610
I just remember.
Yeah,

407
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:06,930
he was so,
like his whole animated on stage.

408
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:09,230
Perfectly animated.
Yeah.

409
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:11,250
There's one joke.
I keep telling people.

410
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:14,670
I was in Amsterdam doing a short reggie 
and uh,

411
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:16,740
he went on,
he did this joke about,

412
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:18,180
you know,
when he was little,

413
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:20,960
he had a cousin who was retarded.
Right.

414
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:23,420
And then one day he was in the basement 
playing with his cousins.

415
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:23,820
They,
you know,

416
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:28,840
they came over and then the cousins 
playing with him and a cousin like 

417
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:32,620
unstretched and I'm glad they're gone.
Shit.

418
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:35,250
And it's Reggie is looking at it.
What the hell?

419
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,750
You're not retarded.
Nah Man,

420
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:41,610
I just do that because it's just easier.
People take care of you.

421
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:45,330
They feed you.
You don't have to go to school or shit.

422
00:19:45,331 --> 00:19:46,830
They're coming backwards.
I see you later.

423
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,280
He goes back into being retired.

424
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:58,630
Reggie's new shit.
He used to have a bit that would just 

425
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:02,630
below the room apart and a bit was about
his experience at a club trying to pick 

426
00:20:04,051 --> 00:20:09,051
up a girl,
but she had this really unattractive 

427
00:20:09,051 --> 00:20:09,960
friend who is very persistent and he had
to,

428
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:13,210
had to be wherever her friend was.
He couldn't get the two of them away.

429
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:18,490
It's a fucking the one at the end.
I don't want to give up the bed in case 

430
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:20,160
he's still doing it because it was just.
It was so fucking.

431
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:22,670
There was a bit where the ugly girl 
parts in.

432
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:24,810
Do you remember when the other girl 
would smash through the.

433
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,100
You can just be crying.
He'd be crying,

434
00:20:29,101 --> 00:20:33,540
laughing because he was so animated and 
the way they played the girl was like so

435
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:36,560
like floppy and fucked up.
It's just you couldn't.

436
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:39,750
You would just cry and laugh and he was 
so confident too.

437
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:40,690
Yeah.
Yeah.

438
00:20:40,691 --> 00:20:42,790
He had an ego like this.
How funny.

439
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:44,380
Reggie is like,
I guess.

440
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:46,690
I guess it's A.
I don't lie on funny,

441
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:49,630
like when Reggie first started,
he was so cocky.

442
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:53,590
I could not like Reggie,
but I could not deny that he was funny.

443
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,210
He thought he was talking.
Really?

444
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:57,300
Yeah.
I'd never had that experience with him.

445
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,170
Now he's just like,
maybe it was just,

446
00:20:59,171 --> 00:21:01,990
maybe it was even part of my insecurity,
but he,

447
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:04,750
he was like,
me and reggie are good friends now,

448
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:09,900
like later on,
but I think it's a testament to how 

449
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:10,950
funny you are when I don't like you and 
you're like,

450
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:16,230
this dude is funny and I would never 
walk out the room when I'm seeing 

451
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:16,230
performance.
I just watched that shit.

452
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:16,920
Not Laugh.
Yeah,

453
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:19,870
you're rolling ben over at a dude you 
don't like.

454
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:22,810
You know what I'm saying?
That's a funny motherfucker right there.

455
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,370
Yeah,
no shit.

456
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:26,020
That's hilarious.
No,

457
00:21:26,021 --> 00:21:27,560
I never.
I never had any issues with them.

458
00:21:27,561 --> 00:21:28,960
It was always nothing but friendly to 
me.

459
00:21:28,961 --> 00:21:33,961
That's why I was shocked that he said he
had an ego because I thought he was a 

460
00:21:33,961 --> 00:21:34,990
head like a real.
It's like in my mind that perception was

461
00:21:34,991 --> 00:21:37,030
like,
this guy's just got the full package.

462
00:21:37,031 --> 00:21:42,031
He's kind of all together.
That's why like when you tell people 

463
00:21:42,031 --> 00:21:42,031
about them and they don't know who he 
is,

464
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:44,200
like how did that happen?
They don't understand that

465
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:44,980
it is,
uh,

466
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:47,110
it was kinda crazy.
Like how does that happen?

467
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:50,200
Because when we were all coming up in 
that time,

468
00:21:50,201 --> 00:21:51,970
you know,
in New York,

469
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:54,880
he was one of the big guys just like 
brewer,

470
00:21:54,881 --> 00:21:58,380
just like all the other guys towel,
who everybody knows now,

471
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,820
but you say Reggie Mcfadden and they 
don't know who he is.

472
00:22:00,821 --> 00:22:04,660
I would have never guessed that would 
have happened based on how you and I saw

473
00:22:04,661 --> 00:22:05,360
him then

474
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:07,680
like you could,
this is a funny game man.

475
00:22:07,681 --> 00:22:09,900
You could never tell you something.

476
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:12,020
People just can't keep it together to 
the,

477
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:17,200
the same thing that makes you funny also
makes you feel a little bit fucking 

478
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:17,200
crazy,
you know?

479
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:21,630
And for some people they just did.
Life just goes off the tracks and into 

480
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:24,561
the woods and there's no one there to 
manage it and bring it back on and go a 

481
00:22:24,561 --> 00:22:24,561
little Duh,
Duh Duh Duh.

482
00:22:24,561 --> 00:22:24,561
You're going to be okay.
All right,

483
00:22:24,561 --> 00:22:26,330
listen,
you got to stop smoking that shit or you

484
00:22:26,331 --> 00:22:31,331
got to stop doing this so you gotta stop
doing that and no more gambling and 

485
00:22:31,331 --> 00:22:34,260
let's.
We're going to get you to a yoga class 

486
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:34,260
when we get you into tries more 
gambling.

487
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:34,410
Grieving.
Yeah,

488
00:22:34,411 --> 00:22:36,270
let's just keep calm me down a little 
bit,

489
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:37,620
but for some folks,
you know,

490
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:42,650
they don't have a person like that in 
their life that looks out for them and 

491
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:43,850
then they just go 100 percent cat 
Williams on you and you know,

492
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:47,190
you don't know what the fuck is,
you know what's happening.

493
00:22:47,191 --> 00:22:47,770
They're like,
well,

494
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:51,040
how do you get a talented guy and allow 
them to go off the rails like that?

495
00:22:51,041 --> 00:22:56,041
You know,
he needs someone in there to settle 

496
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:56,041
down.
Man.

497
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:56,041
Jesus,
we're going to be fine here.

498
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:58,720
Last time I saw Reggie last few times,
I so reggie,

499
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:04,340
you probably know this,
but he was trying to get people to 

500
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:07,971
invest in a gold mine in Costa Rica.
Swear to God.

501
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:12,000
Really?
Yeah.

502
00:23:12,001 --> 00:23:15,750
I think it's gold.
Gold or copper mine in Costa Rica.

503
00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:21,050
And then it's funny,
like we're in a profession where we're 

504
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:21,180
all taking a chance were in 
entertainment lotto,

505
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:23,550
right?
But to us hearing that,

506
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:26,640
it makes him sound crazy.
Yeah.

507
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:29,010
You know what I'm saying?
Just saying that makes him sound crazy.

508
00:23:29,011 --> 00:23:34,011
But we're in a crazy business period 
where we're all taking a chance like we 

509
00:23:34,011 --> 00:23:34,011
are

510
00:23:34,011 --> 00:23:35,810
sort of.
But I think at a certain point in time,

511
00:23:35,811 --> 00:23:38,180
don't you feel like you've developed an 
audience.

512
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:43,230
The people know that if all you have to 
do is keep being funny and keep writing 

513
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:43,870
jokes and you're not going anywhere.
People

514
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:48,870
don't like in La,
like even the brand new comics,

515
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:53,900
like they're in such a rush and then if 
somebody gets one little thing,

516
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:58,980
if it bothers him so much mentally,
like people can't handle not being 

517
00:23:59,151 --> 00:24:04,151
famous right now.
Like my shit is taken like the slow 

518
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:04,151
cooking burn.
Right?

519
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:06,020
But I'm just like a relaxed Jamaican 
dude.

520
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:08,210
This is normal pace for me.

521
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,450
Well,
but you know,

522
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:11,530
famous.
No fame,

523
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:16,560
you're still a top notch.
Stand up comic and you could work 

524
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:16,560
anywhere you want.
You know what I'm saying?

525
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:21,271
I mean,
even if you are still very known in the 

526
00:24:21,271 --> 00:24:22,120
standup world and so you could always 
work.

527
00:24:22,121 --> 00:24:25,280
What I'm saying is once you become like,
you,

528
00:24:25,290 --> 00:24:30,290
you reach a certain level of proficiency
isn't just about maintaining and about 

529
00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:32,050
writing.
You mean you're already,

530
00:24:32,051 --> 00:24:34,540
you're already in a good groove.
You can already make money doing it,

531
00:24:34,541 --> 00:24:34,970
you know,
so the,

532
00:24:34,971 --> 00:24:39,971
the real chances are gone.
So then the chances has to be just 

533
00:24:39,971 --> 00:24:39,971
coming up with new material.

534
00:24:39,971 --> 00:24:42,150
But I think people would just want,
I think,

535
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,470
I think Reggie did have an ego.
He wanted superstar.

536
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:46,550
He should have had it and he shouldn't 
have had.

537
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,910
I don't know how he didn't have it.
And it's,

538
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:50,490
I think people,
some people can't handle not having it.

539
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:51,710
Oh yeah.
Look,

540
00:24:51,711 --> 00:24:56,711
I've been around people who act like I 
stole something from them because I've 

541
00:24:56,900 --> 00:25:00,200
know because I've been successful,
which is ridiculous.

542
00:25:00,201 --> 00:25:01,160
They'll say we're shitty,
like,

543
00:25:01,161 --> 00:25:06,161
must be nice.
The fact that the white sand.

544
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,360
And so do you know,
that's not sincere.

545
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:11,840
That's like a weird passive aggressive,
Douchey way saying it,

546
00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:13,610
you know,
but

547
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:17,520
which is fucked up because you turn 
obtained like uh,

548
00:25:17,521 --> 00:25:19,770
a lot of success and you're still 
working hard.

549
00:25:19,771 --> 00:25:24,210
Like what?
In like some building in woodland hills,

550
00:25:24,211 --> 00:25:27,330
like banging out a podcast,
you know what I mean?

551
00:25:27,331 --> 00:25:28,800
You don't have to do this shit.
Yeah,

552
00:25:28,801 --> 00:25:29,670
you do.
Yeah.

553
00:25:29,671 --> 00:25:33,980
You got to keep doing this shit.
You have to know since of the program,

554
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:37,070
but you're saying you're saying you do.
You do.

555
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,970
Are you saying you do?
Is Good,

556
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,960
like a good testament for you?
You know what I'm saying?

557
00:25:42,961 --> 00:25:44,640
Like there's other people like fuck that
shit.

558
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:48,540
Famous ain't doing nothing.
Is there,

559
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:53,700
you know,
like some people that ain't gonna work 

560
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:53,700
as hard as you are.
My point is your work.

561
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:57,590
Yeah.
It's not that hard and it's not really 

562
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:57,590
work.
See that's the whole beauty of it.

563
00:25:57,590 --> 00:26:02,001
Like it's a pleasure to come here and 
sit down and have a conversation with a 

564
00:26:02,001 --> 00:26:02,001
funny person,
you know,

565
00:26:02,001 --> 00:26:04,380
or an interesting person or scientist or
whoever the fuck it is.

566
00:26:04,381 --> 00:26:06,270
It's fun.
So it's not work.

567
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:11,540
It just so happens that it's pays money,
it's just figuring out a way to do 

568
00:26:11,641 --> 00:26:13,920
something you actually like doing and 
then it just pays money.

569
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:15,790
So then he'd be like an idiot not to do 
it.

570
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:16,950
Like why wouldn't you do it?
It's fun.

571
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:19,410
Some people are too lazy to figure out 
what they like.

572
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:21,570
Yeah.
But you know what the difference between

573
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:26,630
doing this and not doing this,
it's just I'm doing something else for 

574
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:27,420
three hours and this is a fun thing to 
do for three hours.

575
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:30,360
So it's like,
I hardly ever think of it as work.

576
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:32,040
Well that's a good thing.
Yeah.

577
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:32,990
Yeah.
That's,

578
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,280
that's,
that's why you got to keep it going.

579
00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:37,080
You can't,
you got to keep it going.

580
00:26:37,081 --> 00:26:38,970
So the,
you always have like a comfort zone,

581
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:41,700
you know what I mean?
Like if you just completely lay back,

582
00:26:41,701 --> 00:26:43,930
then people forget you.
It's like

583
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:45,930
you're doing a lot of shit.
You got to Jujitsu,

584
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:48,480
you got the,
you know the fights,

585
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:51,140
you got the stuff.
Yeah,

586
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:51,930
yeah,
yeah.

587
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:54,780
You don't combined them.
No shows.

588
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:57,070
I'll do like a show the night before the
UFC,

589
00:26:57,350 --> 00:27:00,390
like that's a lot like you,
you keep it moving,

590
00:27:00,391 --> 00:27:02,170
but it doesn't feel like nothing to you.
But if,

591
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:05,340
if you're on the outside looking in,
if you're working a lot,

592
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:08,310
but if you're listening,
you hustling.

593
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:08,910
Yeah.
Yeah.

594
00:27:08,911 --> 00:27:13,380
But if you were doing what I was doing,
it's none of it's work like that at all.

595
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:16,890
Like if I had to do something that I 
don't enjoy doing and that was traveling

596
00:27:16,891 --> 00:27:18,930
as much as I do,
I really would not be happy.

597
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:21,390
But it's like everywhere I'm going like,
Hey,

598
00:27:21,391 --> 00:27:22,830
I'm going to go do some comedy.
Like Hey,

599
00:27:22,831 --> 00:27:24,000
I'm gonna.
Go see the fights,

600
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:24,410
you know?

601
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:25,890
And it's like,
to me everything's fun.

602
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:31,040
Hey,
am I going to do a podcast with Dan 

603
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:31,040
Edwards?
It's fun.

604
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:31,650
It's all good stuff.
So there's nothing immediately.

605
00:27:31,651 --> 00:27:34,020
Even though you've got to discipline 
yourself a little bit,

606
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:36,810
force yourself to do stuff that's fun 
and which sounds ridiculous,

607
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:42,320
but you did.
You got to just force yourself to make 

608
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:42,320
sure that you do it on a regular,
regular basis.

609
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,350
But other than that it's easy.
You know,

610
00:27:43,351 --> 00:27:47,280
it's just a matter of finding something 
that you do,

611
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:49,800
that you enjoy doing and then just do 
that shit.

612
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,750
I just know that there's a lot of people
listening.

613
00:27:52,290 --> 00:27:54,270
All they do is listening,
listen,

614
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:58,980
and watch and they're not getting to do 
as much as they could be doing.

615
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:04,340
Well.
You saying like some people that like 

616
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:04,340
tune into too much shit and don't 
produce enough shit.

617
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:04,980
So what you mean?

618
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:06,070
Yeah.
Like there's this,

619
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:09,660
there's a lot of people in this world 
that don't like the way you put it.

620
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:12,270
You know,
the way you said you're doing something,

621
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:14,970
it's work,
but you disqualified as work.

622
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:19,350
You qualified as something you like 
doing.

623
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:22,980
It just happens to be work and then 
everybody else,

624
00:28:23,290 --> 00:28:25,400
like they might just qualify it.
As I said,

625
00:28:25,401 --> 00:28:26,250
a lot of work.
Well,

626
00:28:26,251 --> 00:28:28,840
some people do.
It's perspective.

627
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:33,970
Your perspective allows you to do as 
much as you do and other people's 

628
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:35,280
perspective doesn't allow them to do as 
much as they could do.

629
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:37,230
That's a very good point because some 
people,

630
00:28:37,231 --> 00:28:39,180
even with things they used to love 
doing,

631
00:28:39,181 --> 00:28:41,160
they don't love doing it anymore and 
becomes a chore.

632
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:42,030
Right,
exactly.

633
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:47,060
This could never be a chore for me.
You and the UFC could never be a chore 

634
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:47,060
for me.
It'll never be a chore.

635
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:47,420
It's,
it's not.

636
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:50,000
It's not even possible.
Like I met you.

637
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:51,290
You,
you know,

638
00:28:51,410 --> 00:28:52,860
you,
you're a fucking master.

639
00:28:53,770 --> 00:28:54,570
Yeah.
Yeah.

640
00:28:54,810 --> 00:28:56,270
That was in the nineties,
you know,

641
00:28:56,430 --> 00:28:59,430
I think I was a taekwondo master black 
belt.

642
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:03,630
It was a black belt and talk with them 
when I was a little kid.

643
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:09,600
Doesn't really count though for real 
until you're 16 so you can actually 

644
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,730
knock a grown man out.
So there is legit when your six year old

645
00:29:11,731 --> 00:29:15,360
black belt,
that's just not real.

646
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:17,260
They have those.
They have six year old black belt,

647
00:29:17,650 --> 00:29:20,560
a six year old black male to fucking 
kill.

648
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,570
I'll take on for you at the same time.
I mean they would try hard,

649
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:28,640
I'm sure.
Maybe like a 13 year old and those 

650
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,611
Jujitsu,
it could get you a 13 year old jujitsu 

651
00:29:31,611 --> 00:29:31,920
prodigy.
They wouldn't do that 13 year old.

652
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:33,960
Fuck that.
It's too old.

653
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:35,490
Yeah.
You can get you in his legs.

654
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,580
That triangle the fuck out of you and 
put you to sleep under 10.

655
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:41,070
Yeah.
I'm down to old

656
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:45,790
testosterone is balls of drugs on 
interested on this one.

657
00:29:45,791 --> 00:29:49,240
All the 13 year old Jujitsu people out 
there to know that you're too old for me

658
00:29:49,770 --> 00:29:51,850
prior to get it out there.
I'll fight any of you.

659
00:29:51,851 --> 00:29:52,900
Hold on.
Let's see.

660
00:29:52,901 --> 00:29:54,160
Your boss.
Let me see what you got.

661
00:29:54,370 --> 00:29:55,480
Okay.
Your balls are too big.

662
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:57,460
Get outta here.
Your balls have dropped.

663
00:29:58,870 --> 00:29:59,210
Yeah.

664
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:02,950
Even that might be to the young kids.
Like what would that one,

665
00:30:02,951 --> 00:30:04,900
seven year old kid that was like all 
buff.

666
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,400
You know,
they worked out every day.

667
00:30:06,401 --> 00:30:08,090
Remember there's videos of him and it 
like,

668
00:30:08,091 --> 00:30:08,960
it looks like a creek.
Yeah.

669
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:11,680
That kid of the family was giving him 
steroids.

670
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:12,330
Yeah.
No,

671
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:13,300
fuck.
That's fucked up.

672
00:30:13,301 --> 00:30:14,640
Now.
That kid I'd be scared of.

673
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:16,420
Yeah.
Well he's still a little.

674
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:19,020
They get cheerios and throw it on the 
gram.

675
00:30:19,021 --> 00:30:20,250
Like here's cheerios.
Get away from you.

676
00:30:20,251 --> 00:30:22,090
It's probably never been kicked in the 
Dick before.

677
00:30:22,091 --> 00:30:27,091
You would have no idea how to react.
You don't develop the right kind of 

678
00:30:27,091 --> 00:30:28,090
composure when you're six to take a full
shot to the Dick.

679
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:32,110
I start kicking him in the Dick.
He doesn't have strong gonna run,

680
00:30:32,111 --> 00:30:34,690
crying and screaming and he's not going 
to think of doing it first.

681
00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:39,730
You just go right for his little Dick.
This little six year old Dick with a 

682
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:42,660
boot.
Your defense would be saying that Santa 

683
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:43,500
Claus isn't real and stuff like get away
from me isn't real.

684
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:48,330
Where you could talk about kicking a six
year old in the artificial sixth year.

685
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:53,340
It was a real six year old like saying 
you should actually go out there and 

686
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:53,710
kick back in the day.
This is a complete.

687
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:55,120
I mean that kid this day.

688
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:57,030
It's probably like 20,
you know,

689
00:30:57,031 --> 00:30:59,180
that was a long ass time ago that he was
like a child.

690
00:30:59,181 --> 00:31:01,380
It's probably list.
Sorry Buddy.

691
00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:03,660
We don't really mean.
You should've got kicks on the deck.

692
00:31:03,661 --> 00:31:07,770
This is all hypothetical comedy.
You say they get it,

693
00:31:07,771 --> 00:31:12,771
but under the Patriot Act I think we 
have to disclose that we have to tell 

694
00:31:12,771 --> 00:31:13,510
people.
But um,

695
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:14,670
yeah,
but even back then,

696
00:31:14,671 --> 00:31:17,320
you know,
like doing comedy never felt like,

697
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:18,880
like real work.
I mean it was like,

698
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:23,960
it was the real work was the fact that 
you didn't know if you were going to 

699
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:23,960
make it and you're scared,
you know,

700
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:28,281
like we'd be terrified.
And when I first started out all I 

701
00:31:28,281 --> 00:31:29,110
wanted to do our member very clear,
like what,

702
00:31:29,170 --> 00:31:34,170
what,
how awesome it would be to pay your 

703
00:31:34,170 --> 00:31:34,170
bills,
doing comedy.

704
00:31:34,170 --> 00:31:36,870
So I saw all these guys that were like 
the main headliners and Boston and all I

705
00:31:36,871 --> 00:31:40,350
could think of was like man to one day 
be able to pay my bills,

706
00:31:40,351 --> 00:31:40,860
doing comedy.

707
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:45,920
I never thought that I would get to the 
point where people would actually come 

708
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:50,361
out to see me.
I thought I could just like headline at 

709
00:31:50,361 --> 00:31:53,361
a club and that would be who would be 
there that weekend because the way it 

710
00:31:53,361 --> 00:31:57,201
worked in Boston,
it was like you looked at the local 

711
00:31:57,201 --> 00:31:59,391
lineups,
like Kevin Knox would be there one 

712
00:31:59,391 --> 00:31:59,391
weekend and then Robbie printz would be 
there the next week.

713
00:31:59,391 --> 00:32:01,860
The guys,
it was all the same dudes that worked in

714
00:32:01,861 --> 00:32:05,910
our circuit and we sort of went in all 
these different Boston comics.

715
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:07,920
Really good,
very good,

716
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:13,010
very good comics and so like you.
What you hope for is to get into that 

717
00:32:13,010 --> 00:32:17,211
line up with your hope for it to be one 
of those guys where you're making a 

718
00:32:17,211 --> 00:32:17,211
living,
you know,

719
00:32:17,211 --> 00:32:21,921
just telling jokes.
Because I would look at those guys like 

720
00:32:21,921 --> 00:32:22,350
would be like,
this guy doesn't have a job at all.

721
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:25,160
All he does is tell jokes while there's 
that kid,

722
00:32:25,890 --> 00:32:28,320
Jesus Christ.
That's so sick.

723
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:31,170
They were given that kid steroids.
Man.

724
00:32:31,530 --> 00:32:33,960
That's so funny.
How old is he there?

725
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,460
Seven.
What?

726
00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:37,200
Oh,
that's so crazy.

727
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:40,370
That's so sad too,
because that his whole system,

728
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:43,880
it just gets fucking red line at an 
early age like that.

729
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:47,910
Pumping all that shit into his body 
because it's really hard for top,

730
00:32:48,010 --> 00:32:48,620
top.
Yeah.

731
00:32:48,621 --> 00:32:52,070
It's really hard for a kid to get that 
kind of muscle development at seven.

732
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:54,320
I mean,
you can't mean it is possible.

733
00:32:54,321 --> 00:32:55,670
You could be some freak.
Now,

734
00:32:55,671 --> 00:32:57,410
if you looked at this with like blurry 
eyes,

735
00:32:57,411 --> 00:32:58,370
he would swear his.

736
00:32:58,650 --> 00:33:03,650
It's hanging out.
I know I didn't want to say anything 

737
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:07,671
because his thumbs in the perfect spot.
I'm going to send a lot of pedophiles to

738
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:12,210
decide they're going to go wacky.
This is like free free pedophilia.

739
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:17,240
Like you can get away with it.
You can pretend and just get away with 

740
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:17,240
it.
Look at that TV over there too.

741
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:19,380
Muscle bounds,
year old TV over there.

742
00:33:19,381 --> 00:33:22,700
It looks like he's holding a flashlight.
It does.

743
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:24,780
If you're a little further away,
if you just squinted,

744
00:33:24,781 --> 00:33:29,781
if you're looking at it on your phone,
you would swear that if you don't have 

745
00:33:29,781 --> 00:33:29,781
20 slash 20,
that's a car.

746
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:31,740
Don't do it.
Beaver cleaver.

747
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:33,420
Yeah,
he's a,

748
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:36,270
he looks very like thick faced like 
instrumental

749
00:33:36,270 --> 00:33:38,550
boy.
But that poor kid,

750
00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:39,810
whatever the fuck they did to him.

751
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:41,800
But um,
you know,

752
00:33:41,801 --> 00:33:44,200
when we were,
when we were doing comedy back then,

753
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:44,830
uh,
you know,

754
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:49,890
in Boston it was like,
I still wasn't really like a 

755
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:53,790
professional.
I've only been doing it a couple of 

756
00:33:53,790 --> 00:33:53,790
years.
I wasn't,

757
00:33:53,790 --> 00:33:53,790
I could fall apart at any moment.
You know,

758
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:57,190
and I still didn't think that I would 
ever like continued to be able to pay my

759
00:33:57,191 --> 00:33:58,300
bills,
doing comedy.

760
00:33:58,301 --> 00:33:59,050
Like I was still like,

761
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:01,900
did you make any money up there?
I made a little.

762
00:34:01,930 --> 00:34:06,930
When I first started going to New York 
was when I got a manager and that was 

763
00:34:06,930 --> 00:34:08,990
the first manager I ever got.
And uh,

764
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:14,070
when I got that,
the best thing about it is that he 

765
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:14,650
started getting the books in like these 
little clubs,

766
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:16,330
you know,
I mean even our couldn't headline.

767
00:34:16,331 --> 00:34:18,340
I could middle and spots and I can make 
a living,

768
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:20,460
but I knew that I,
I,

769
00:34:20,470 --> 00:34:25,470
you know,
I had to like progress past that and 

770
00:34:25,470 --> 00:34:25,570
figuring out a way to actually have 
enough money.

771
00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:28,580
So for sure I knew how to pay my bills 
because he was still like,

772
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:31,720
touch and go all the time.
Who was your manager back then?

773
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:33,620
Same Guy.
Same guys today sitting.

774
00:34:33,650 --> 00:34:34,170
I said,
yeah,

775
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:35,910
he picked me up when I was an open 
miker.

776
00:34:35,930 --> 00:34:37,120
Who is that?
Jeff Salzman.

777
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:38,050
Oh,
Jeff Salzman.

778
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:40,570
Yeah,
he's the shit.

779
00:34:41,170 --> 00:34:43,510
He's a great guy.
He's like an old school manager,

780
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:48,550
you know,
he's like one of those guys who was 

781
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:50,340
people care talent.
It's kind of a little piece of paper in 

782
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:50,340
his pocket.
He writes his notes,

783
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:53,590
he's just fucking,
he's an awesome human to just a really,

784
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:55,480
really great guy.
He doesn't like me talking about him.

785
00:34:55,481 --> 00:35:00,481
So I stopped talking about them now,
but he's been my manager since I was 

786
00:35:00,481 --> 00:35:03,910
like 22 or some shit when I met you at 
the Boston.

787
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:07,090
Like I think like we're in different 
mental comedy phases.

788
00:35:07,091 --> 00:35:10,030
Like I was trying to.
I had some material that got me into the

789
00:35:10,031 --> 00:35:13,930
Boston and I was trying to get off that 
material and just come up with new shit.

790
00:35:14,090 --> 00:35:15,070
Right.
And then.

791
00:35:15,270 --> 00:35:20,270
So then there was moments when I just 
struggled for a while just trying to 

792
00:35:20,270 --> 00:35:24,001
figure shit out.
And at the same time I was repeating a 

793
00:35:24,001 --> 00:35:26,500
lot of mistakes and I wasn't a writing 
as much as I should.

794
00:35:26,501 --> 00:35:27,670
Well,
you writing a lot back then

795
00:35:27,770 --> 00:35:29,990
it tried to try to,
you know,

796
00:35:30,310 --> 00:35:35,310
I tried to constantly,
I feel real bad if I don't constantly 

797
00:35:35,310 --> 00:35:37,000
come up with new material.
So I went through a phase,

798
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:37,980
the beginning where I was

799
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:42,980
writing a lot,
but I didn't know how to write very 

800
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:42,990
good.
So most of it was shit like man,

801
00:35:42,991 --> 00:35:44,910
when I would like when I was living in 
new Rochelle.

802
00:35:44,911 --> 00:35:48,960
So when I was in New York I wrote,
I wrote three pages of it.

803
00:35:48,961 --> 00:35:52,290
That might be one line that should be 
considered a second time.

804
00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:55,130
I'll go back and look,
I've keeps,

805
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,580
I've kept some of my notebooks.
I go back and look at my writing,

806
00:35:57,581 --> 00:36:00,270
but it was a box.
This is horseshit.

807
00:36:00,271 --> 00:36:03,690
It's just utter complete horseshit,
you know,

808
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:05,730
I just,
it was just hard to write,

809
00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:07,740
you know,
I had to develop a point of view.

810
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:11,280
You have to become a,
an actualized human being.

811
00:36:11,281 --> 00:36:16,281
You can't just,
you can't just write with no life 

812
00:36:16,281 --> 00:36:16,281
experience.
And that's essentially what I was doing.

813
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:18,690
I didn't know anything.
I didn't belong.

814
00:36:19,050 --> 00:36:21,450
I shouldn't have been the one talking.
I really didn't deserve it.

815
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:25,050
I didn't have enough to say.
I didn't think about what I was going to

816
00:36:25,051 --> 00:36:25,760
say.
I didn't,

817
00:36:25,761 --> 00:36:27,630
you know,
I was just trying to stumble through it.

818
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:28,560
Like most 20 years,

819
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,690
like I felt that a lot of times it's 
like,

820
00:36:30,691 --> 00:36:32,130
what the fuck am I saying?
Oh,

821
00:36:32,131 --> 00:36:35,280
you're just trying to be.
He's trying to be funny.

822
00:36:35,281 --> 00:36:38,430
So you were watching people and you're 
getting ideas of funny.

823
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,250
Yeah.
And,

824
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:40,830
and you're,
you're trying to build something.

825
00:36:40,831 --> 00:36:41,790
You don't even know what you're 
building.

826
00:36:41,791 --> 00:36:46,791
You don't know what.
You should have a perspective and kind 

827
00:36:46,791 --> 00:36:48,450
of right from there like you,
you have no idea.

828
00:36:48,451 --> 00:36:52,950
Shit is just happening and you and 
somehow you figure it out later on.

829
00:36:52,951 --> 00:36:57,951
But in the beginning they,
maybe only a few people know exactly 

830
00:36:57,951 --> 00:36:59,040
what they're supposed to do.
Yeah.

831
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:04,520
It seems so easy when you watch it.
When you watch a guy like say if you're 

832
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:07,851
seeing a guy on stage,
like a good example,

833
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:11,280
like a Jerry Seinfeld type character,
he seems like he's just talking.

834
00:37:11,790 --> 00:37:13,020
He's just talking.
They just,

835
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:18,110
he knows how to pause at the right time 
and in the timing and pause the way it 

836
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:23,040
cracks the material inside your echoes 
off the inside of your brain.

837
00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:26,700
But it looks easy and if you've ever 
made your friends laugh,

838
00:37:26,730 --> 00:37:28,890
like I was trying to explain this,
this young kid the other day,

839
00:37:28,891 --> 00:37:30,510
this kid came up to me and he said,
hey man,

840
00:37:30,511 --> 00:37:35,511
I just started doing comedy and he lives
up in Santa Barbara and it's like we've 

841
00:37:35,511 --> 00:37:36,600
got a little amateur scene up here.
Not much,

842
00:37:36,601 --> 00:37:41,601
but you know,
I'm practicing there and then I'm gonna 

843
00:37:41,601 --> 00:37:42,480
eventually come down to La and do some 
real open mics and this and that.

844
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:46,470
And he's at that spot where you start 
out and you're like,

845
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,540
man,
I don't,

846
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:50,090
can I fucking do this?
And I go,

847
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:51,150
why'd you want to do it?
He goes,

848
00:37:51,151 --> 00:37:53,400
because I make my friends laugh all the 
time because I could.

849
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:55,440
I could kill like a bunch of people at a
party.

850
00:37:55,441 --> 00:37:57,000
I'll say some funny shit,
man.

851
00:37:57,001 --> 00:37:59,040
Especially if I'm a little drunk.
I go,

852
00:37:59,041 --> 00:37:59,850
well,
let me tell you something.

853
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:02,130
If you can do that,
if you do that in a party,

854
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:07,400
you can do that on stage.
You just have to figure out how to do 

855
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:07,400
it.
But it ain't gonna be easy.

856
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:10,140
It's going to be confusing because it 
seems like it should be easy,

857
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:15,920
but the ability to relay a thought to a 
bunch of strangers and have them accept 

858
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:20,301
that thought and it's most efficient 
form and have it hit notes that they 

859
00:38:20,341 --> 00:38:23,060
didn't see coming.
That's hard to do,

860
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:23,460
man.

861
00:38:23,610 --> 00:38:26,430
It is hard to do and it's like 
indifferent.

862
00:38:26,650 --> 00:38:31,650
I don't know about you,
but in different stages of my comedy 

863
00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:31,650
career,
I.

864
00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:31,800
They were things I was trying to figure 
out.

865
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:35,890
So what you mentioned about talking to 
that kid like one time it was like,

866
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:36,680
all right,
no,

867
00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:41,690
I guess I'm kind of funny but I'm not as
funny as I am in conversations with 

868
00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:42,400
people.
So how do I transfer offstage,

869
00:38:42,401 --> 00:38:47,401
meet on stage and then so then I have to
think about like I took awhile to 

870
00:38:48,581 --> 00:38:51,420
examine that for like maybe a year or 
so.

871
00:38:51,421 --> 00:38:56,421
It's like I need to be me offstage.
I need to bring that dude onstage 

872
00:38:56,421 --> 00:38:58,890
because the onstage dude,
it's kind of different than the offstage

873
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:02,380
dude and I just want to be one person I 
don't want to be too.

874
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:07,740
So then it was just like so many like 
things you've got to go through to build

875
00:39:09,431 --> 00:39:14,431
yourself into who you gonna end up being
enslaved and then there's perspective 

876
00:39:14,431 --> 00:39:18,490
and then there's jokes was my writing 
style and that changes from time to time

877
00:39:18,810 --> 00:39:20,830
and it's sometimes you have a set that's
really good,

878
00:39:20,831 --> 00:39:25,831
but then as you get tired of it and then
you gotta come up with some stuff that 

879
00:39:25,831 --> 00:39:26,380
you're not tired of new stuff.

880
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:28,480
It's just like it's an ongoing thing.

881
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:34,100
Yeah.
And the knowing when to put new stuff 

882
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:35,280
out there too.
So it's the beginning of standup comedy,

883
00:39:35,281 --> 00:39:40,281
like developing it.
I guess it'd probably be just like 

884
00:39:40,281 --> 00:39:40,281
developing a band,
you know,

885
00:39:40,281 --> 00:39:43,600
the band doesn't know what the fuck it's
still in the beginning either and then 

886
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:43,600
you get together,
you fucking bang on some jobs.

887
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:48,201
Somebody comes up with some chords,
you figure out how to write some words 

888
00:39:48,201 --> 00:39:49,420
down and who knows what it becomes.
A lot of times bands changed too.

889
00:39:50,010 --> 00:39:52,050
But yeah,
the time we were,

890
00:39:52,051 --> 00:39:54,600
we were in very similar positions that,
that,

891
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:56,580
you know,
like what the fuck am I doing time?

892
00:39:56,740 --> 00:39:57,080
It's funny.
Like,

893
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:57,680
Oh,
you know,

894
00:39:57,681 --> 00:39:58,370
is that,
you know,

895
00:39:58,371 --> 00:40:00,860
you want to make people laugh and that's
all you got.

896
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,600
It's like,
it's like somebody saying,

897
00:40:02,910 --> 00:40:05,450
here's the topic,
write a movie.

898
00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:07,490
The topic is,
uh,

899
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:09,290
going to the store now,
right?

900
00:40:09,310 --> 00:40:12,980
A 120 page script about going into the 
store and it's like,

901
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:18,040
that's it.
That's all you're going to give me a 

902
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:18,040
comic days.
Like I know I want to make people that I

903
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:20,840
could go there.
There's a stage getting that figured out

904
00:40:20,841 --> 00:40:21,830
as fast as you can.

905
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:26,900
Every anybody has.
Everybody has their own path and your 

906
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:27,840
way of doing it just because like,
like I can't,

907
00:40:27,841 --> 00:40:30,240
I would not do comedy.
Stephen writes way.

908
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,400
That's his way.
He came up with it.

909
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:33,840
Obviously.
It was awesome.

910
00:40:33,870 --> 00:40:36,330
Obviously it was brilliant.
Obviously it was amazing,

911
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:38,000
but that's how,
that's,

912
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:39,750
that's his thing.
And he found that thing.

913
00:40:39,850 --> 00:40:44,520
So that's proof positive that there's no
real prescription for this.

914
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:46,800
There's no,
there's no real guidebook.

915
00:40:46,801 --> 00:40:49,350
You got to see.
Everybody's got their own funny.

916
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:52,050
Mitch Hedberg is funny.
It's different than Cat Williams.

917
00:40:52,051 --> 00:40:55,820
Funny.
Everybody's got their own with those two

918
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:56,580
guys are similar.

919
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:03,810
Mitch Hedberg the same purpose,
not well,

920
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:06,600
maybe similar in their choices.
Yeah.

921
00:41:06,601 --> 00:41:07,320
Yeah.
Crazy,

922
00:41:07,890 --> 00:41:11,730
crazy making choices,
but it's in that beginning,

923
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:14,310
if you don't know if you're making the 
right decision or the wrong decision,

924
00:41:14,311 --> 00:41:19,311
you're going down past and trying to 
figure out what's the right one and you 

925
00:41:19,311 --> 00:41:19,311
know,
I went for A.

926
00:41:19,311 --> 00:41:21,570
I went for a period of time.
I was trying to dress up nice.

927
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:28,700
Larry Snow wearing was my manager.
Talked me into it man.

928
00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:31,030
I wore like a nice button up dress 
shirt,

929
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:36,800
club support that.
That was a cool period and I thought I 

930
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:40,901
was.
I know you mean you're thinking of when 

931
00:41:40,901 --> 00:41:40,901
my album came out.
Yeah.

932
00:41:40,901 --> 00:41:42,320
That was just an idea I did only for the
album.

933
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:45,320
It was the,
the idea was that I figured out a way to

934
00:41:45,321 --> 00:41:48,200
get through life without wearing a tie 
and when I was a,

935
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:50,690
when I was working as a limo driver back
in Boston,

936
00:41:50,691 --> 00:41:55,691
one of the things I thought I would like
to get through life where I never have 

937
00:41:55,691 --> 00:41:55,691
to wear a fucking tie.

938
00:41:55,691 --> 00:41:56,540
Like that was like a thing.
Like when people say,

939
00:41:56,541 --> 00:42:01,541
what do you want to do?
I want to get through life without ever 

940
00:42:01,541 --> 00:42:03,821
wearing a fucking tie.
And when I finally got something that 

941
00:42:04,041 --> 00:42:06,830
was on like a copy of something,
like a CD,

942
00:42:06,890 --> 00:42:09,380
that was my first thing that ever 
released at all.

943
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:14,680
So it was like putting that on like,
let me wear a fucking times suit jacket 

944
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:15,020
just for goof.
So it was a mess.

945
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:17,940
It was a good mix for me.
That was just.

946
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:23,140
I thought it was cool.
That'd be cool if you did that all the 

947
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:23,140
time.
Well I don't.

948
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:23,960
I'm not,
I don't really like ties,

949
00:42:23,961 --> 00:42:28,961
man.
I think that especially with my history 

950
00:42:28,961 --> 00:42:28,961
in Jujitsu,
I don't want to wear something around my

951
00:42:28,961 --> 00:42:31,010
neck.
You could choke and I'm not into that.

952
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:36,040
Do you remember what?
Too many dudes that could put me to 

953
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:36,040
sleep,
but they grabbed my tie.

954
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:40,080
That's funny.
I hate suits because the only time you 

955
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:40,080
wear them is that a,
a funeral?

956
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:41,720
So I wanted to do it.
Nothing.

957
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:45,350
No funeral attire ever.
So I just hate to hate it.

958
00:42:45,351 --> 00:42:46,730
Suit.
So that's why.

959
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:51,760
That's one of the reasons why comedy 
fits perfect and you'll always run into 

960
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:54,701
like a manager or somebody that has a 
room that wants you to dress up and you 

961
00:42:54,701 --> 00:42:58,511
just feel like a rash breaking out just 
at the thought of having to put some 

962
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:02,500
formal shit.
Hell No.

963
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:04,880
I dressed real nice at the end of the 
world party though.

964
00:43:04,990 --> 00:43:05,510
Yeah,
you did?

965
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:06,770
Yeah.
That show A.

966
00:43:06,771 --> 00:43:11,030
I wore a suit.
I wear like a tailor made suit and pants

967
00:43:11,031 --> 00:43:12,950
and a nice shirt.
I didn't wear a tie though,

968
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:17,260
but I thought it looked very like so you
weren't chalkable sophisticated.

969
00:43:17,310 --> 00:43:22,310
Actually.
Just got off work and if you have any 

970
00:43:22,310 --> 00:43:22,310
collar on me call on.

971
00:43:22,310 --> 00:43:26,110
Anybody that can.
Like for Ronda Rousey chick gets a hold 

972
00:43:26,110 --> 00:43:26,110
of your collar first.
Social,

973
00:43:26,110 --> 00:43:28,010
she'll throw you in your fucking head.
Chicken from the movie?

974
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:31,440
No,
she's the chick that's a UFC champion.

975
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:31,970
Oh,
okay.

976
00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:37,060
She was in strikeforce women's champion 
and now they give her the UFC belt and 

977
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:37,820
she's.
She's headlining a big paper yet.

978
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:39,920
We're going to try to get her in here 
before then,

979
00:43:39,921 --> 00:43:44,921
but I bet she's busy as fuck now in 
training and she says a lot of books in 

980
00:43:44,921 --> 00:43:45,290
a month.
She says bug stuff.

981
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:46,340
Yeah.
Like she's like,

982
00:43:46,990 --> 00:43:47,590
Shit,
you know,

983
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:49,430
whack.
She talks a lot,

984
00:43:49,431 --> 00:43:51,260
but she's awesome.
She's a fun check.

985
00:43:51,261 --> 00:43:56,261
She's very cool.
She's hot as fuck and she can kick your 

986
00:43:56,261 --> 00:43:56,261
ass like.
It's very like.

987
00:43:56,261 --> 00:43:58,670
She's like legit man.
Like she'll tap a man.

988
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:01,170
No doubt type of man.
She gets your arm.

989
00:44:01,171 --> 00:44:02,410
She'll break your fucking arm,
son.

990
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:07,680
She was.
She break it on the second level of 

991
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:07,680
women that could break my arm.
She will no doubt about it.

992
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:12,191
She has tapped six women in a row,
six first round armbars these.

993
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:14,130
They can't fuck with it.
Her arm bar.

994
00:44:14,131 --> 00:44:17,180
It's just so nasty.
She flips you around until she gets it.

995
00:44:17,181 --> 00:44:19,040
She's done it a million times.
Her arm bars,

996
00:44:19,041 --> 00:44:21,140
so god damned good.
I seen an interview,

997
00:44:21,141 --> 00:44:26,141
but I've never seen a fight.
She's fought six times with the same 

998
00:44:26,141 --> 00:44:29,981
exact move.
Nobody's ever done that in the history 

999
00:44:29,981 --> 00:44:30,590
of MMA.
It's really fucking crazy.

1000
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:31,740
When you stop.
Think about it,

1001
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:36,660
there's not one person who became a 
champion and all of their fights leading

1002
00:44:36,661 --> 00:44:39,160
up to the championship.
We're one in the exact same message.

1003
00:44:39,310 --> 00:44:41,280
You only see that in the ww.

1004
00:44:43,610 --> 00:44:48,610
Oh,
he's going for some dudes that have won 

1005
00:44:48,610 --> 00:44:48,750
a lot,

1006
00:44:48,810 --> 00:44:53,810
but like even more than she has.
Like this is a guy named Paul Sas and 

1007
00:44:53,810 --> 00:44:57,141
he's got a really good guard.
This kid is nasty off his back and he 

1008
00:44:57,141 --> 00:45:01,221
taps people by triangle all the time.
So I think he has something like nine 

1009
00:45:01,221 --> 00:45:02,910
taps by triangle,
which is like unheard of.

1010
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:06,150
Unheard of,
but he also won by.

1011
00:45:06,151 --> 00:45:07,440
He'll hook.
He's,

1012
00:45:07,441 --> 00:45:12,441
you know,
he's lost a fight or two since he got 

1013
00:45:12,441 --> 00:45:12,441
tapped.
Recently.

1014
00:45:12,441 --> 00:45:13,350
Someone took us.
I think Matt Wyman tapped him.

1015
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:16,230
So it's like he's had some bad results 
with her.

1016
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:21,380
It's just every single result was she 
wins by Armbar her whole career.

1017
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:26,540
That's craziness.
That's pretty unusual for a chick was 

1018
00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:27,150
hot as fuck.
Oh good.

1019
00:45:27,330 --> 00:45:29,460
Good Dude.
Come on,

1020
00:45:29,461 --> 00:45:30,730
sign.
That's got to be nervous.

1021
00:45:31,170 --> 00:45:33,960
Unnerving.
A hot chick throws up flying triangle on

1022
00:45:33,961 --> 00:45:37,740
your ass because you're so close to 
heaven and yet you're going to black out

1023
00:45:37,741 --> 00:45:39,810
any second.
Now she's choking her legs.

1024
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:42,130
Okay.
That's horrifying from man,

1025
00:45:42,131 --> 00:45:45,750
but that's the move.
Like she puts a leg on bar,

1026
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:50,190
but it's a triangle triangle.
The triangle has an well.

1027
00:45:50,191 --> 00:45:54,930
What it is is it has an arm stuck in,
in the legs are wrapped around your head

1028
00:45:54,990 --> 00:45:56,270
and shoulders.
Questioning,

1029
00:45:56,320 --> 00:46:01,320
chokes you.
Has anybody tried to start eating her 

1030
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:03,220
pussy when they're in that move?
You

1031
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:08,260
could,
but you don't have much time and you 

1032
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:08,260
would have to.
You'd have to.

1033
00:46:09,290 --> 00:46:11,150
You train your tongue.
I'm here.

1034
00:46:11,151 --> 00:46:11,540
Okay.
Let's.

1035
00:46:11,541 --> 00:46:16,541
Let's just go through the motion.
I think you might be able to eat my 

1036
00:46:16,541 --> 00:46:18,190
pussy for a little bit,
but you got to get it

1037
00:46:18,220 --> 00:46:20,050
to work.
You're going to have to get through that

1038
00:46:20,051 --> 00:46:22,840
span.
Index and granny panties.

1039
00:46:22,890 --> 00:46:25,460
She's got underneath there.
For you to be really effective.

1040
00:46:25,461 --> 00:46:28,320
If you're going to have to somehow know 
the rip her panties open

1041
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:30,820
during the fight.
Suppose you practice that in training.

1042
00:46:31,390 --> 00:46:32,770
I don't think.
I think you're going to sleep.

1043
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:36,580
I think she's going to be insulted that 
you think you'd get out of combat,

1044
00:46:36,610 --> 00:46:39,520
but just eating her pussy like a woman 
that you know,

1045
00:46:39,521 --> 00:46:41,920
a woman when she can tap you and 
dominate you like that,

1046
00:46:41,921 --> 00:46:44,080
she's not going to respect you and allow
you to breed with her.

1047
00:46:44,410 --> 00:46:48,450
So just the fact that you got into that 
position and it's her mercy that you.

1048
00:46:48,590 --> 00:46:51,610
She lets you eat her pussy and then she 
kills you with her legs.

1049
00:46:51,611 --> 00:46:54,820
Is that what's going to happen there?
At least you get more pleasure.

1050
00:46:57,150 --> 00:46:59,590
I don't know if you do some lose,
lose anything.

1051
00:46:59,620 --> 00:47:04,620
Anyway.
If you were in that position when the 

1052
00:47:04,620 --> 00:47:04,620
lights go out

1053
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:10,800
crying,
it's like the ultimate perv begging me 

1054
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:11,790
alive.
I feel.

1055
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:15,630
Can you imagine her kaggle exercises?
Price.

1056
00:47:15,660 --> 00:47:17,710
Snap your chicken head right off.
Yeah.

1057
00:47:18,410 --> 00:47:21,290
Don't let anybody tell you that.
Trying to get you in a tongue bar.

1058
00:47:21,350 --> 00:47:26,350
All vaginas are created equally because 
of vagina that's built in a woman who's 

1059
00:47:26,750 --> 00:47:30,910
built like a woman who has like a good 
musculature is healthy.

1060
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:34,620
Everything will be tight in there.
There's muscle ass,

1061
00:47:34,630 --> 00:47:35,340
muscle,
leg,

1062
00:47:35,350 --> 00:47:37,600
muscle.
It's a tighter vagina.

1063
00:47:37,630 --> 00:47:42,630
It's a better fit.
She could pretty much give you a hand 

1064
00:47:42,630 --> 00:47:42,670
job with her vagina.
Yeah,

1065
00:47:42,671 --> 00:47:45,340
I'm sure.
Like a world class athlete.

1066
00:47:46,350 --> 00:47:51,350
Right,
and let's just say any random world 

1067
00:47:51,350 --> 00:47:54,181
class athlete.
I wouldn't want to disrespect Rhonda by 

1068
00:47:54,181 --> 00:47:55,510
speaking of her vagina graphic manner,
how we're buddies.

1069
00:47:55,670 --> 00:48:00,670
Name girl.
You see a girl who's like a serious 

1070
00:48:00,670 --> 00:48:02,320
crossfit athlete.
Fucking that girl would probably be like

1071
00:48:02,321 --> 00:48:04,690
having sex with a fist.
You know,

1072
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:06,730
like a girl is like really muscular.

1073
00:48:06,860 --> 00:48:08,290
It's probably better.
It makes sense.

1074
00:48:08,670 --> 00:48:10,330
It makes sense.
It's a reward.

1075
00:48:10,331 --> 00:48:15,331
The University of rewarding you for 
meeting with someone who's not a lazy 

1076
00:48:15,331 --> 00:48:15,331
bitch.
I'm into.

1077
00:48:15,331 --> 00:48:19,380
I'm into that.
That's what I'm talking about and 

1078
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:22,620
thinking about that shit with a porn 
star because they use it so much with 

1079
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:22,620
it.
Build up that muscle and they lose their

1080
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:24,310
tolerance skits.
All sloppy.

1081
00:48:24,670 --> 00:48:25,500
No,
I don't know.

1082
00:48:25,501 --> 00:48:30,501
I mean porn star.
The reality of a porn star is they 

1083
00:48:30,501 --> 00:48:33,661
probably don't have any more sex than 
the average person because the average 

1084
00:48:33,881 --> 00:48:38,881
person,
if you're in your twenties and you have 

1085
00:48:38,881 --> 00:48:38,881
your,
you have a boyfriend.

1086
00:48:38,881 --> 00:48:39,160
If you guys are monogamous,
that dude's gonna.

1087
00:48:39,161 --> 00:48:44,161
Try to fuck you at least five times a 
week and if he doesn't fuck you five 

1088
00:48:44,161 --> 00:48:46,690
times a week.
So when you do,

1089
00:48:48,670 --> 00:48:50,830
especially if you're really stupid,
you're saying I don't want to do it.

1090
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:52,630
You don't want to do it.
You're 20.

1091
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:55,510
Everybody wants it's 21 to fuck every 
day.

1092
00:48:55,750 --> 00:48:58,020
You know that's normal.
So like every,

1093
00:48:58,120 --> 00:49:03,120
any normal girl who's like in her 
twenties is probably getting fucked 

1094
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:04,450
constantly.
If she has a boyfriend.

1095
00:49:04,510 --> 00:49:05,830
Right?
So what,

1096
00:49:05,831 --> 00:49:07,150
how much is a porn star?
Have sex,

1097
00:49:07,180 --> 00:49:08,740
they have sex,
like you know,

1098
00:49:08,741 --> 00:49:10,810
maybe they have sex with a few more 
people,

1099
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:15,960
but in a lot of ways being a porn star,
but other than the fact that people 

1100
00:49:16,511 --> 00:49:19,720
watch and masturbate and then it becomes
a public thing,

1101
00:49:19,721 --> 00:49:24,721
then it becomes a weird thing where the 
way you interface with people is a lot 

1102
00:49:24,721 --> 00:49:27,481
of times sexual.
But if you think about the way porn 

1103
00:49:27,481 --> 00:49:30,730
stars have relationships,
it's really more like what that dude who

1104
00:49:30,731 --> 00:49:35,731
wrote a sex at dawn,
Dr Christopher Ryan was talking about 

1105
00:49:35,731 --> 00:49:38,560
when he was talking about the communal 
societies where they had multiple sexual

1106
00:49:38,561 --> 00:49:39,100
partners.

1107
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:41,530
Because if these people are all just 
having like what you said,

1108
00:49:41,531 --> 00:49:43,510
there's like five guys or something like
that.

1109
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:44,980
Yeah.
So they all just,

1110
00:49:45,460 --> 00:49:47,500
they have,
they all just trade off.

1111
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:52,810
So really that's not that much different
than a lot of like regular girls.

1112
00:49:52,811 --> 00:49:54,490
Even if you're with a different dude 
every night.

1113
00:49:54,580 --> 00:49:56,590
It's like some girl's boyfriend every 
night.

1114
00:49:56,710 --> 00:50:01,710
Yeah.
Some girls are with their boyfriend 

1115
00:50:01,710 --> 00:50:03,421
every night and you know,
and some girls who are playing the 

1116
00:50:03,421 --> 00:50:03,421
field,
they've got a couple different guys that

1117
00:50:03,421 --> 00:50:07,321
are competing for their attention,
which means they're getting drilled by 

1118
00:50:07,321 --> 00:50:09,130
like two or three different guys who are
also nonmonogamous.

1119
00:50:09,370 --> 00:50:11,680
So maybe they're having sex with other 
people as well.

1120
00:50:11,681 --> 00:50:16,681
So like it's not that scary having sex 
with a porn star that way at all in that

1121
00:50:18,311 --> 00:50:23,311
way.
And that way it's not that much 

1122
00:50:23,311 --> 00:50:25,201
different than a regular person.
Like if you could just have you count 

1123
00:50:25,201 --> 00:50:25,201
the partners.
Yeah,

1124
00:50:25,201 --> 00:50:27,050
the number might be different,
but if you count the amount of times you

1125
00:50:27,051 --> 00:50:27,690
having sex

1126
00:50:28,420 --> 00:50:33,420
and that probably is the same.
The number might not even be different 

1127
00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:36,401
over time because what if the girl only 
has sex when she's at work and you know 

1128
00:50:36,401 --> 00:50:38,180
she can't have a relationship because 
dudes can't deal with it or whatever the

1129
00:50:38,181 --> 00:50:43,181
fuck it is.
So she's only having sex at work so 

1130
00:50:43,181 --> 00:50:45,010
she's only fucking the same three or 
four guys for a whole year more.

1131
00:50:45,011 --> 00:50:49,280
Whereas another 20 year old girl who 
likes to party and she does coke,

1132
00:50:49,710 --> 00:50:51,060
she might fight.
Fuck

1133
00:50:51,370 --> 00:50:53,800
some guys a month in one night at Vegas,

1134
00:50:54,740 --> 00:50:56,780
things can get crazy.
People do crazy shit.

1135
00:50:57,110 --> 00:51:02,110
So it's like,
it's funny that porn is such a gigantic 

1136
00:51:02,110 --> 00:51:04,430
business,
but that it's still this weird thing,

1137
00:51:04,431 --> 00:51:07,460
this weird fucking.
Everybody wants to have sex,

1138
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:10,730
but if you're having sex and people can 
watch everybody's,

1139
00:51:10,950 --> 00:51:15,950
what the fuck or more than like apple 
won't put it in Itunes,

1140
00:51:16,451 --> 00:51:21,451
but yeah,
you go to any hotel chain and you can 

1141
00:51:21,451 --> 00:51:22,340
rent fucking any porn movie you went.
I watched the other day I was at the war

1142
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:26,350
or some chain hotel and I've got like 
double anal video.

1143
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:29,200
Why did you,
why did you buy it on the TV?

1144
00:51:29,201 --> 00:51:31,690
Why don't you hit the girl I was with 
was in it and we wanted to.

1145
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:37,510
Jesus Christ as some vanity.
You just broke the Internet.

1146
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:40,750
You just broke the Internet.
You are a mess.

1147
00:51:40,751 --> 00:51:42,700
She watched a girl get fucked by other 
guys.

1148
00:51:43,270 --> 00:51:43,870
Yeah.
On.

1149
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:46,060
Yeah.
It's weird to watch her,

1150
00:51:46,170 --> 00:51:51,170
you know,
I would imagine there'll be while on 

1151
00:51:51,170 --> 00:51:51,170
molly.
Oh my God.

1152
00:51:51,940 --> 00:51:52,540
Well,
hey,

1153
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:57,720
different strokes through.
Do you need say the data from different 

1154
00:51:57,720 --> 00:51:57,720
strokes time.
That sucks,

1155
00:51:58,620 --> 00:51:59,750
Mr.
Yeah,

1156
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:01,020
Mr Trump,
and by the way,

1157
00:52:01,050 --> 00:52:03,190
creepy moment of history,
uh,

1158
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:06,180
the first episode of different strokes 
were Mr Trotman is like,

1159
00:52:06,181 --> 00:52:07,170
hey,
come on,

1160
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:08,400
get down to your,
your,

1161
00:52:08,670 --> 00:52:11,520
your tidy whities and let us all go into
the bath tub together.

1162
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:12,680
You remember that scene?
Oh

1163
00:52:12,690 --> 00:52:13,600
sure.
No,

1164
00:52:13,601 --> 00:52:15,880
I blocked that one out.
Like a bad molestation.

1165
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:19,030
I don't even want to watch it about 
that.

1166
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:23,470
There's no need for that.
You know about this Aaron Swartz Guy,

1167
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:23,880
this,
uh,

1168
00:52:23,910 --> 00:52:28,910
the coder,
the committed suicide and all the 

1169
00:52:28,910 --> 00:52:31,981
trumped up charges that they had on them
to have this kind of cocreated rss feed.

1170
00:52:32,490 --> 00:52:33,550
Yeah,
he did.

1171
00:52:33,551 --> 00:52:36,490
He couldn't cocreated the RSS feed.
I think when he was,

1172
00:52:36,491 --> 00:52:38,080
um,
fuck,

1173
00:52:38,081 --> 00:52:40,120
I think he was like 15 or something 
crazy,

1174
00:52:40,121 --> 00:52:43,400
like he doesn't even exist.
You Guy,

1175
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:48,280
just the guy just started dating some 
football players committed suicide.

1176
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:50,410
Do you understand that?
The recommended suicide,

1177
00:52:50,430 --> 00:52:52,660
they didn't really commit suicide on 
Saturday.

1178
00:52:52,661 --> 00:52:54,340
Right?
It'd be a little more respectful son.

1179
00:52:54,460 --> 00:52:59,460
He was only 26 years old and they,
the reason why he was incredibly 

1180
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:03,931
clinically depressed,
whatever he might have problems on his 

1181
00:53:03,931 --> 00:53:04,570
own,
but on top of whatever problems he might

1182
00:53:04,571 --> 00:53:09,571
have had,
the government was trying to go after 

1183
00:53:09,571 --> 00:53:11,050
him,
the crazy fucking case and he was up for

1184
00:53:11,140 --> 00:53:14,020
a potential thing where he was going to 
be in jail for 50 years.

1185
00:53:14,210 --> 00:53:16,280
50.
What is the charge?

1186
00:53:16,281 --> 00:53:18,910
Is it not?
Not Anything to do with RSS Feeds?

1187
00:53:18,911 --> 00:53:21,940
Obviously.
I do not know the exact charges.

1188
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,260
I don't know,
uh,

1189
00:53:23,310 --> 00:53:25,890
what,
what they were trying to nail him with,

1190
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:26,250
but

1191
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:28,130
whatever it was,
it was,

1192
00:53:28,150 --> 00:53:33,150
it was.
The way it was being done was really 

1193
00:53:33,150 --> 00:53:34,170
crazy.
Like this guy was,

1194
00:53:34,710 --> 00:53:38,220
he was like a big innovator in,
in the,

1195
00:53:38,310 --> 00:53:43,310
in the field of coding and the creation 
of the rss feed is really important for 

1196
00:53:43,321 --> 00:53:44,360
things like this.
Podcasts,

1197
00:53:44,590 --> 00:53:49,590
like without his contribution,
who knows what would've happened if me 

1198
00:53:49,590 --> 00:53:52,830
and apparently by all accounts was a 
very nice person.

1199
00:53:52,860 --> 00:53:55,170
Was He paid?
I don't know.

1200
00:53:55,171 --> 00:53:57,450
I don't know how much money.
I didn't know what his situation was,

1201
00:53:57,451 --> 00:53:59,940
but it doesn't matter when the 
government's going after you like that.

1202
00:53:59,941 --> 00:54:02,220
Like it's either way you're fucked.

1203
00:54:03,110 --> 00:54:05,780
No.
You know what I like about court cases,

1204
00:54:06,490 --> 00:54:11,490
how like a prosecutor will tell a 
jewelry who you are as a defendant,

1205
00:54:15,170 --> 00:54:20,170
like this person.
We're going to tell you how we're going 

1206
00:54:20,170 --> 00:54:23,711
to tell you what they did and how they 
and why they thought of it and why they 

1207
00:54:23,711 --> 00:54:25,340
did it.
Like you'd never met me.

1208
00:54:25,820 --> 00:54:27,440
Like,
how the fuck do you know?

1209
00:54:28,010 --> 00:54:30,770
It's like you made this story up and 
you're going to try to prove it,

1210
00:54:30,890 --> 00:54:32,750
but you know,
you don't fucking know me.

1211
00:54:36,580 --> 00:54:37,900
Yeah.
It's,

1212
00:54:37,901 --> 00:54:42,901
uh,
it's very weird when someone decides 

1213
00:54:42,901 --> 00:54:45,061
that they're going to take you in front 
of a group of people that are going to 

1214
00:54:45,061 --> 00:54:48,571
define you,
write a bunch of strangers who have to 

1215
00:54:48,571 --> 00:54:50,380
like judge you carefully and really the 
people that judge you,

1216
00:54:50,381 --> 00:54:55,381
the people that actually know you and 
would know what kind of person you are 

1217
00:54:55,381 --> 00:54:55,860
and what you did right,
and what you're capable of.

1218
00:54:55,870 --> 00:54:59,080
When you see jury,
people like God,

1219
00:54:59,130 --> 00:55:04,130
you've got to rely on their opinions and
you got to rely on whether or not some 

1220
00:55:04,130 --> 00:55:06,950
dude who's really crafty with the words 
can be reality.

1221
00:55:07,050 --> 00:55:07,720
Yeah.
It's like,

1222
00:55:07,830 --> 00:55:09,810
it's like a lot of people crafting with 
words,

1223
00:55:09,811 --> 00:55:14,811
man,
tastes change shit around and that's 

1224
00:55:14,811 --> 00:55:14,811
your ass.

1225
00:55:14,811 --> 00:55:17,150
I feel bad for Lindsay Lohan having to 
deal with that like every day.

1226
00:55:17,210 --> 00:55:19,460
I mean that's pretty much what she does 
every single day now.

1227
00:55:19,790 --> 00:55:24,790
All the court cases and shit.
I did it for like seven months and it 

1228
00:55:24,790 --> 00:55:29,291
was like one of the worst times in my 
life having to deal with just fucking 

1229
00:55:29,291 --> 00:55:29,291
going to court.
Having lawyers.

1230
00:55:29,291 --> 00:55:31,200
Didn't you wash it or what was it?
Eh,

1231
00:55:31,330 --> 00:55:33,180
there was some shit,
but if your um,

1232
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:35,130
yeah,
if you're stuck like that man,

1233
00:55:35,131 --> 00:55:36,130
you're,
you're in like a,

1234
00:55:36,140 --> 00:55:39,360
a legal turmoil.
That shit will take years off your life.

1235
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:41,250
It's a lot of stress,
man.

1236
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:42,630
This,
uh,

1237
00:55:43,020 --> 00:55:44,670
this guy,
uh,

1238
00:55:45,210 --> 00:55:48,180
he was part of the RSS Development 
working group,

1239
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:51,240
coauthored rss one point zero.
I mean,

1240
00:55:51,241 --> 00:55:52,440
just that alone,
man,

1241
00:55:52,441 --> 00:55:55,320
they should be kissing this guy's ass.
He shouldn't be rich.

1242
00:55:55,980 --> 00:55:59,650
Whereas bill burr that night though,
they got no,

1243
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:04,760
he didn't.
He was arrested by federal authorities 

1244
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:07,941
in connection with systematic 
downloading of academic journal 

1245
00:56:07,941 --> 00:56:08,070
articles.
So it's crazy.

1246
00:56:08,071 --> 00:56:09,630
It's so,
it's academic journal articles.

1247
00:56:09,631 --> 00:56:12,130
I believe those are free.
Yeah.

1248
00:56:12,210 --> 00:56:17,210
So he was arrested for providing people 
with the ability to download something 

1249
00:56:17,911 --> 00:56:21,130
that's already free.
Oh my God.

1250
00:56:21,131 --> 00:56:26,131
It doesn't seem like it makes sense,
but he opposed their practice of 

1251
00:56:26,131 --> 00:56:29,551
compensating publishers rather than 
authors out of the fees that it charges 

1252
00:56:29,551 --> 00:56:31,240
to for access to articles.

1253
00:56:31,750 --> 00:56:36,750
So he contended that the j Isto our 
fees,

1254
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:42,880
limited access to academic work produced
at American colleges and universities.

1255
00:56:42,910 --> 00:56:44,470
Wow,
that's really interesting.

1256
00:56:44,950 --> 00:56:49,950
So he pretty much was paying like the,
the use or the subscriptions to certain 

1257
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:55,120
articles that maybe the school was 
trying to sell for a higher price maybe.

1258
00:56:55,330 --> 00:56:57,730
And it's hard to tell.
It seems like,

1259
00:56:57,731 --> 00:56:59,680
um,
yeah,

1260
00:57:00,190 --> 00:57:05,190
it's the bullets.
Apparently he gave them access to this 

1261
00:57:05,190 --> 00:57:08,320
digital library j store,
what we're talking about.

1262
00:57:08,350 --> 00:57:10,870
That's what the thing was that,
uh,

1263
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:15,900
was accusing him.
It's short for the journal Storage and 

1264
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:19,741
it's a digital library founded in 1995 
originally containing a digitized back 

1265
00:57:19,961 --> 00:57:24,961
issues of academic journals and now also
includes books and primary sources and 

1266
00:57:25,001 --> 00:57:30,001
current issues of journals.
Provides full text searches for more 

1267
00:57:30,001 --> 00:57:31,030
than a thousand journals,
blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.

1268
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:32,290
Okay.
Check this out.

1269
00:57:32,860 --> 00:57:37,860
It a program providing limited no cost 
access to old articles for individual 

1270
00:57:37,860 --> 00:57:42,421
scholars and researchers who registered.
So you just have to register so that it 

1271
00:57:42,761 --> 00:57:47,761
sounds like some trumped up bullshit 
that they were going to put this kid in 

1272
00:57:47,761 --> 00:57:48,940
jail for 50 years for that.
I mean that sounds really fucking crazy.

1273
00:57:48,941 --> 00:57:50,590
It sounds like you could have got out of
it.

1274
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:54,670
I don't know.
Maybe not.

1275
00:57:54,700 --> 00:57:59,700
You know,
and just that kind of fucking pressure 

1276
00:57:59,700 --> 00:58:00,730
breathing down your back when you think 
that the government is after and they're

1277
00:58:00,731 --> 00:58:05,731
gonna come after you and they gonna lock
you up for some technology related shit 

1278
00:58:05,731 --> 00:58:07,810
because technology related shit gets 
really wacky because the idea is like if

1279
00:58:07,811 --> 00:58:12,811
you create rss feeds,
rss feeds have been shown to be used in 

1280
00:58:12,811 --> 00:58:14,860
committing what they believe is a 
technological crime.

1281
00:58:15,070 --> 00:58:20,070
Then all of a sudden you know,
like when somebody else does is you'll 

1282
00:58:20,070 --> 00:58:20,910
blame almost like a rico.
Yeah.

1283
00:58:22,390 --> 00:58:26,750
What do you need to go swabbing?
Since he was one of my first.

1284
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:31,460
He was one of my first.
I'm a celebrity sightings women.

1285
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:36,480
Yeah.
That's when I first moved here in 

1286
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:38,461
[inaudible] 94.
I was on Hollywood boulevard right in 

1287
00:58:38,461 --> 00:58:39,120
front of Man's Chinese theater and Rico 
Suave and his,

1288
00:58:39,121 --> 00:58:44,121
his buddy and two ladies were walking 
across the street and Rico had the 

1289
00:58:44,121 --> 00:58:44,620
Bandana on and everything and I was 
like,

1290
00:58:44,621 --> 00:58:49,621
God damn,
that is Rico Suave or you might 

1291
00:58:49,621 --> 00:58:49,621
yourself.
I was by myself.

1292
00:58:49,621 --> 00:58:52,750
I was like in his Bandana.
I wasn't a Volkswagon Corrado.

1293
00:58:53,860 --> 00:58:57,480
Look at Rico Suave to make an inner 
monologue that's like,

1294
00:58:58,100 --> 00:59:00,060
this is going to be okay living here.

1295
00:59:00,460 --> 00:59:01,290
No,
no,

1296
00:59:02,100 --> 00:59:02,930
no,
but uh,

1297
00:59:03,210 --> 00:59:04,000
but my,
uh,

1298
00:59:04,030 --> 00:59:06,200
my,
if I did have an inner monologue of bill

1299
00:59:06,201 --> 00:59:06,810
as,
wow,

1300
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:08,400
that's fucking Rico Suave

1301
00:59:11,470 --> 00:59:14,730
I would say.
And then I would think

1302
00:59:15,020 --> 00:59:20,020
a famous person because he's probably 
one of the first actual famous people I 

1303
00:59:20,020 --> 00:59:21,320
ever saw.
I really didn't want to think it.

1304
00:59:21,730 --> 00:59:22,010
He was

1305
00:59:22,010 --> 00:59:24,140
huge back then.
If I think about it.

1306
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:28,160
I mean I guess I knew,
um,

1307
00:59:28,730 --> 00:59:31,640
Mario Joiner because I had already done 
mtv.

1308
00:59:33,340 --> 00:59:36,650
I met Mario joinder was more famous 
probably at that time.

1309
00:59:36,651 --> 00:59:41,651
Didn't even Rico Suave men.
Remember Memorial Joyner was a hosted 

1310
00:59:41,651 --> 00:59:43,580
the MTV half hour comedy hour.
He was fucking huge man.

1311
00:59:43,700 --> 00:59:45,360
He was a failure.
I think I want,

1312
00:59:45,410 --> 00:59:47,930
I want to say it was funny as shit still
is.

1313
00:59:47,931 --> 00:59:49,100
Funniest.
Funniest Shit.

1314
00:59:49,101 --> 00:59:50,660
Yeah.
Well he's another one of those guys,

1315
00:59:50,661 --> 00:59:54,260
like how come they're not gigantic?
Explain that.

1316
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:56,930
Explain all the dudes that you know that
are kind of mediocre.

1317
00:59:56,931 --> 01:00:01,931
There's a lot of people know.
And then I kind of know what the fuck 

1318
01:00:01,931 --> 01:00:01,931
it's like music does that.
Like,

1319
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:07,080
like when I look at like musicians,
like there's a music she's done more 

1320
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:09,760
than isn't named Chubby checker.
The guy that took the twists.

1321
01:00:10,140 --> 01:00:12,110
Yeah,
but why do we know him?

1322
01:00:12,350 --> 01:00:14,510
And not people that had albums were for 
work.

1323
01:00:15,210 --> 01:00:18,680
Cause that shit caught on fire in the 
1953 people were dumb as fuck

1324
01:00:19,770 --> 01:00:21,450
and there was so many remakes of that 
shit.

1325
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:24,710
Even the fat boys remade that shit in 
the eighties

1326
01:00:26,650 --> 01:00:30,490
so it's would never die.
And this guy is famous for one,

1327
01:00:30,530 --> 01:00:35,020
he made a song but it's a song about a 
dance work.

1328
01:00:36,070 --> 01:00:39,430
And back then man,
any opportunity to be joyful and be like

1329
01:00:39,431 --> 01:00:43,810
thank God the opportunity to be joyful.
People just got back from World War Two.

1330
01:00:43,850 --> 01:00:45,270
Okay.
World War had just ended.

1331
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:48,820
We dropped bombs on them.
We were in a cold war with Russia.

1332
01:00:49,150 --> 01:00:54,150
Everybody thought that nuclear bombs 
going to drop our heads for 30 fucking 

1333
01:00:54,150 --> 01:00:54,570
years.
Between 1950 and 1980.

1334
01:00:54,790 --> 01:00:56,410
Everybody thought we were going to war 
with Cuba,

1335
01:00:56,440 --> 01:00:59,080
but literally through that whole time.
So you know,

1336
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:04,240
any toys,
he likes to let this guy just dance me 

1337
01:01:06,811 --> 01:01:11,811
out of my worry because my dad went over
and now he has no legs and I don't want 

1338
01:01:11,811 --> 01:01:13,170
that to happen to me.
That's going on now.

1339
01:01:13,230 --> 01:01:16,040
Yeah,
it absolutely don't.

1340
01:01:16,580 --> 01:01:18,440
Any type of instruction,
dance songs,

1341
01:01:18,441 --> 01:01:18,950
they still work.

1342
01:01:19,530 --> 01:01:24,530
The only difference between then and now
is then everybody thought they were 

1343
01:01:24,530 --> 01:01:24,530
gonna get drafted.
It was a different feeling.

1344
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:29,100
So come on,
let's twist this.

1345
01:01:29,110 --> 01:01:33,540
Any opportunity to fucking 50.
SPLUNK's sucked up fat dick.

1346
01:01:34,230 --> 01:01:36,450
They look so dumb.
They're cars are stupid.

1347
01:01:36,451 --> 01:01:38,580
They couldn't slow down for shit.
You know,

1348
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:41,170
nobody had seat belts.
Get out of here with that seatbelt.

1349
01:01:41,190 --> 01:01:46,190
You just traveling around that metal 
cage rattling around inside with your 

1350
01:01:46,190 --> 01:01:49,041
baby in your lap.
It was things were death traps and 

1351
01:01:49,051 --> 01:01:52,680
that's how everybody got around those 
big fucking old bel airs and Shit.

1352
01:01:53,070 --> 01:01:58,070
Chested drawers on wheels.
I always described those little cars 

1353
01:01:59,971 --> 01:02:04,971
like rhinos on rollers and ozone 
smashing into each other like sounds 

1354
01:02:04,971 --> 01:02:09,000
uncoordinated shit.
Although a little more.

1355
01:02:09,030 --> 01:02:11,760
It's less,
more ridiculous than yours.

1356
01:02:11,761 --> 01:02:14,640
Yours is actually a better description 
because it is like that.

1357
01:02:14,641 --> 01:02:17,040
Those,
those fucking things are pieces of shit.

1358
01:02:17,041 --> 01:02:20,220
Those old cars feel all bouncy

1359
01:02:20,220 --> 01:02:22,760
and the fucking steering is vague as 
fuck.

1360
01:02:22,860 --> 01:02:27,860
To steering is vague.
You're pissing off everybody that hangs 

1361
01:02:27,860 --> 01:02:28,590
out at Bob's big boys in Burbank

1362
01:02:29,470 --> 01:02:30,100
cars.
Man.

1363
01:02:30,101 --> 01:02:33,520
I had a lot of old cars.
I know the difference between those.

1364
01:02:33,570 --> 01:02:37,210
The old steering in those cars.
It was ridiculous.

1365
01:02:37,240 --> 01:02:38,980
There was.
It was so dangerous.

1366
01:02:39,310 --> 01:02:41,530
The braking on those old cars,
the balance,

1367
01:02:41,531 --> 01:02:46,531
they weren't balanced at all.
They just made them the shape they 

1368
01:02:46,531 --> 01:02:46,531
wanted to make them.

1369
01:02:46,531 --> 01:02:47,020
Women didn't need yoga back then.
They get yoga.

1370
01:02:47,030 --> 01:02:50,250
I'm just the car.
Yeah.

1371
01:02:50,260 --> 01:02:55,260
Those things were away.
Easy to crash with the cars we have 

1372
01:02:55,260 --> 01:02:55,630
today.
That Burbank night,

1373
01:02:55,710 --> 01:02:56,960
the Friday night.
That's crazy.

1374
01:02:57,050 --> 01:03:01,790
They had a Batman one where it was just 
every single Batman car ever made people

1375
01:03:02,170 --> 01:03:06,010
do those every Friday mean Batman car.
Oh yeah.

1376
01:03:06,030 --> 01:03:11,030
I think there are kits.
I think you could lower it by an old 

1377
01:03:11,030 --> 01:03:13,441
cadillac and have it converted.
Know what's funny about the Burbank on 

1378
01:03:13,441 --> 01:03:17,161
Fridays.
It's like the black version of that was 

1379
01:03:17,161 --> 01:03:17,770
crenshaw on Sundays.
Oh really?

1380
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:18,190
Yeah,
yeah.

1381
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:19,240
Yeah.
He's back there.

1382
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:22,090
But they shut down the crenshaw one for 
titus.

1383
01:03:22,091 --> 01:03:27,091
Wasn't there people got shot.
Joe Friends.

1384
01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:32,900
When you're showing off your car only 
milkshakes and delicious food happening 

1385
01:03:32,900 --> 01:03:33,970
at the Burbank ones.
All white people.

1386
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:37,370
Oops.
The uh,

1387
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:40,030
the Bob's big boy one is a,
that's what?

1388
01:03:40,030 --> 01:03:45,030
Burbank.
Burbank near all of Burbank in Alameda.

1389
01:03:48,250 --> 01:03:50,300
And uh,
something like,

1390
01:03:50,410 --> 01:03:52,090
that's the one where it actually has the
big,

1391
01:03:52,120 --> 01:03:55,420
big boy.
Big Box where I go every night.

1392
01:03:55,510 --> 01:03:58,960
So every Sunday they get together and 
just look at cars every Friday.

1393
01:03:58,961 --> 01:04:01,260
Yeah.
That night at like 8:00

1394
01:04:01,260 --> 01:04:06,260
PM or something like early,
like some people have really nothing to 

1395
01:04:06,260 --> 01:04:07,690
do and there's a lot of older guys and 
this is the highlight of their week.

1396
01:04:08,140 --> 01:04:11,070
So they'll be out there in a day and it 
just goes to like nighttime.

1397
01:04:11,320 --> 01:04:16,320
Huh.
And I recommend if you go there to 

1398
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:18,571
actually get the steak and eggs there 
because they have a higher quality 

1399
01:04:18,571 --> 01:04:19,430
version of stake there.
So it's good stuff.

1400
01:04:19,540 --> 01:04:24,540
It's good.
I haven't eaten at Bob's big boy in a 

1401
01:04:24,540 --> 01:04:24,540
long fucking for 24 hours,
man.

1402
01:04:24,770 --> 01:04:27,340
Boy,
they got Internet there.

1403
01:04:27,640 --> 01:04:28,800
That's where you go after.
You know,

1404
01:04:28,950 --> 01:04:31,930
I'm usually waiting with a girl so I 
don't really see a way of life.

1405
01:04:32,660 --> 01:04:35,660
The last thing wants to see is that girl
fucking watched the girl,

1406
01:04:36,300 --> 01:04:37,260
the girl.
Fuck.

1407
01:04:37,270 --> 01:04:38,690
Why are you eating state quarter

1408
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:46,920
dudes in their cars.
It's a funny thing when the pussy just 

1409
01:04:46,920 --> 01:04:50,161
stops,
there's no more pushing your life and 

1410
01:04:50,161 --> 01:04:52,570
you just polished the share that car,
the car all the time.

1411
01:04:52,571 --> 01:04:57,571
Just,
you know those older dudes with like 

1412
01:04:57,571 --> 01:04:57,820
vintage cars that they clean with a 
toothbrush.

1413
01:04:58,550 --> 01:04:59,800
Okay,
I see what's going on here.

1414
01:04:59,830 --> 01:05:04,830
Can I see what's going on here?
They take care of the other special 

1415
01:05:04,830 --> 01:05:08,131
cloth in their pocket that they hope to 
get that special cloth out the micro 

1416
01:05:10,211 --> 01:05:13,480
cloth and wipe it there.
Do you fuck with cars?

1417
01:05:13,481 --> 01:05:14,920
Is it anything that you,
uh,

1418
01:05:15,020 --> 01:05:17,200
you fixate on cars?
Do you like cars?

1419
01:05:17,260 --> 01:05:17,920
Nah.

1420
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:19,930
No it wouldn't.
I fixate on.

1421
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:24,310
Is this just jokes really?
And maybe trouble with girls.

1422
01:05:26,530 --> 01:05:28,780
Trouble with girls.
He mean relationships.

1423
01:05:28,781 --> 01:05:29,860
I think that's what you're saying.

1424
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:30,550
Yeah.
I just,

1425
01:05:30,610 --> 01:05:33,170
I just like any,
any.

1426
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:36,860
I think most disputes I have with a 
woman end up on stage,

1427
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:38,120
like,
like,

1428
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:41,480
like most of my friends,
like why are you even dealing with these

1429
01:05:41,481 --> 01:05:42,470
pictures?
I said,

1430
01:05:42,710 --> 01:05:46,940
because it's material,
it's constructive,

1431
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,440
you know?
Yeah.

1432
01:05:48,441 --> 01:05:50,900
A lot of comics take that approach.
That's what I did.

1433
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:53,990
That's why I'm going to avn tomorrow.
Good luck fucker.

1434
01:05:54,740 --> 01:05:55,270
Yeah,
a lot.

1435
01:05:55,271 --> 01:06:00,271
A lot of comlex take that approach.
I used to think that he couldn't be 

1436
01:06:00,271 --> 01:06:03,671
enlightened in not claiming 
enlightenment by any stretch of the 

1437
01:06:03,671 --> 01:06:03,671
imagination.
I'm certainly not enlightened,

1438
01:06:03,671 --> 01:06:07,640
but I used to think that you couldn't 
even seek it and be a funny comedian.

1439
01:06:07,970 --> 01:06:08,870
I thought,
you know,

1440
01:06:10,010 --> 01:06:12,980
lightened meant seek peace because to be
a comic,

1441
01:06:12,981 --> 01:06:16,240
to me that was like the,
the idea was always that if you're going

1442
01:06:16,250 --> 01:06:19,640
to be at my favorite kind of comics,
there was no peace.

1443
01:06:19,970 --> 01:06:24,970
My favorite kind of complex where 
Kennison and hex and prior and you know,

1444
01:06:25,071 --> 01:06:26,600
and the guys from Boston,
you know,

1445
01:06:26,601 --> 01:06:27,020
the,
uh,

1446
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:30,170
the guys that people don't know about,
like Steve Sweeney and Don Gavin.

1447
01:06:30,171 --> 01:06:31,090
And so there,
there,

1448
01:06:31,091 --> 01:06:33,590
there was a salt comedy and that was 
coming out.

1449
01:06:33,591 --> 01:06:34,850
You're beating you over the head with 
it.

1450
01:06:34,851 --> 01:06:38,840
There was no sot nom up in this bitch is
crazy comedy.

1451
01:06:38,841 --> 01:06:41,030
So I always thought that like to do that
kind of comedy.

1452
01:06:41,450 --> 01:06:45,680
Like you really can't be like trying to 
like get your shit together.

1453
01:06:46,700 --> 01:06:48,970
You have to have some cash in your life.
You have nothing to talk.

1454
01:06:49,240 --> 01:06:54,240
Well I think the good thing about life,
it'll always bring your chaos no matter 

1455
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:55,370
how peaceful you are.
And then being a human,

1456
01:06:55,850 --> 01:06:58,430
you still going to do human shit though,
you know better.

1457
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:04,520
So you know that that's always a but.
But I understand always wanted to keep 

1458
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:09,101
your comedy edge and you probably walked
away from like peace like earlier on 

1459
01:07:12,170 --> 01:07:16,220
just because you thought you wanted to 
keep it comedy edge but now a little bit

1460
01:07:16,221 --> 01:07:19,640
grown and you're like fuck it,
I can be funny and be peaceful

1461
01:07:19,900 --> 01:07:21,730
a little bit.
But it was also like with me,

1462
01:07:21,731 --> 01:07:26,731
it was like a sort of a,
a natural process of doing everything 

1463
01:07:26,731 --> 01:07:29,620
stupid that you can do to realize,
okay,

1464
01:07:29,890 --> 01:07:33,160
well I won't be doing that.
And there's another one.

1465
01:07:33,190 --> 01:07:33,770
Well,
all right,

1466
01:07:33,780 --> 01:07:36,760
I won't do that one again.
And then by the time you get to be like,

1467
01:07:36,910 --> 01:07:39,130
you know,
37 years old or some shit,

1468
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:39,730
you go,
okay,

1469
01:07:39,731 --> 01:07:44,731
I think I've accumulated a pretty good 
database of what's gotten me in trouble 

1470
01:07:44,731 --> 01:07:46,690
and when it's not gotten me in trouble 
and I need to figure out how to navigate

1471
01:07:46,691 --> 01:07:49,370
towards the right hand side of this 
equation because this is,

1472
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:54,680
I'm not,
I'm fucking up my own life by doing 

1473
01:07:54,680 --> 01:07:54,680
this.
And this night I'm enjoying it.

1474
01:07:54,680 --> 01:07:55,450
I'm like,
what do I enjoy?

1475
01:07:55,690 --> 01:07:57,520
And I had to kind of break it down,
you know,

1476
01:07:57,521 --> 01:07:58,610
I enjoy,
you know,

1477
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:01,500
different activities and enjoy doing 
standup.

1478
01:08:01,570 --> 01:08:03,430
And I enjoy hanging out with my comedian
friends.

1479
01:08:04,060 --> 01:08:09,060
What I tell him,
enjoy his girls were telling me that it 

1480
01:08:09,060 --> 01:08:10,701
shouldn't hang out with comedians all 
the time because they just reinforce 

1481
01:08:10,701 --> 01:08:11,530
your opinions and you think that you 
know that you're not fucked up,

1482
01:08:11,531 --> 01:08:16,531
but you are fucked up and you're just 
hanging around with these comedians and 

1483
01:08:16,531 --> 01:08:16,531
they're fucked up too.
So you're like,

1484
01:08:16,531 --> 01:08:16,531
oh,

1485
01:08:16,531 --> 01:08:18,800
I'm okay because fucking Ari Shaffir 
thinks it's okay.

1486
01:08:18,801 --> 01:08:23,801
It's funny because I say something funny
and fucking Joey Diaz Lab said that's 

1487
01:08:23,801 --> 01:08:25,550
not okay.
They never even got a chance to say that

1488
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:31,560
I didn't allow them.
Girl tries to talk shit about my 

1489
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:33,200
comedian friends shoot talking about 
crazy,

1490
01:08:33,650 --> 01:08:36,410
but you know,
in my younger days I just won't tolerate

1491
01:08:36,411 --> 01:08:41,411
it.
But then by the time I hit like around 

1492
01:08:41,411 --> 01:08:41,411
30,
I was like,

1493
01:08:41,411 --> 01:08:42,230
all right,
first of all,

1494
01:08:42,231 --> 01:08:44,950
I got to it instituted no headshots,
policy and no hair,

1495
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,240
no head shots or chicken with no head,
no headshots,

1496
01:08:47,270 --> 01:08:47,870
none.
None.

1497
01:08:48,290 --> 01:08:49,490
None.
None of that nonsense.

1498
01:08:49,610 --> 01:08:51,230
Trying to act.
We try to do,

1499
01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:53,270
try to say,
fuck Outta here.

1500
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:57,170
Get outta here with half of the chicks 
in La.

1501
01:08:57,560 --> 01:08:59,000
Yeah.
And you know what?

1502
01:08:59,001 --> 01:09:01,840
And it's a rude thing to say,
especially because I've had headshots,

1503
01:09:02,210 --> 01:09:03,650
you know,
it's ridiculous.

1504
01:09:03,680 --> 01:09:08,680
It's,
I can understand you being upset with 

1505
01:09:08,680 --> 01:09:08,680
me.

1506
01:09:08,680 --> 01:09:10,870
Like I'm not saying I'm perfect,
but I'm saying as far as like the people

1507
01:09:11,601 --> 01:09:14,390
that I get along with and I can't get 
along with other performers.

1508
01:09:14,540 --> 01:09:16,500
It's a Yin Yang sort of a thing.
And it's.

1509
01:09:16,550 --> 01:09:18,770
It is,
it's not a jealousy thing.

1510
01:09:18,980 --> 01:09:23,980
It's not a selfish thing.
Like I don't like to talk about like 

1511
01:09:23,980 --> 01:09:28,130
when me and my wife talk,
we never talk about like my comedy,

1512
01:09:28,250 --> 01:09:29,990
like never.
I'll tell her like,

1513
01:09:30,020 --> 01:09:31,280
ah,
it's fucking show was great.

1514
01:09:31,281 --> 01:09:33,050
It was a lot of fun.
I'll tell her that,

1515
01:09:33,260 --> 01:09:35,830
but I don't ever like,
Whoa,

1516
01:09:35,860 --> 01:09:38,990
I don't need to go over the process with
you.

1517
01:09:38,991 --> 01:09:39,920
I don't need to go.
What,

1518
01:09:39,921 --> 01:09:41,240
what do you think?
This is funny.

1519
01:09:41,241 --> 01:09:43,250
We don't have,
I don't have any of those conversations.

1520
01:09:43,290 --> 01:09:48,290
None of them.
And there's a lot of shit that I would 

1521
01:09:48,290 --> 01:09:50,591
say I'm sure that she wouldn't find 
funny or that she would think it's 

1522
01:09:50,591 --> 01:09:50,591
fucked up.
But.

1523
01:09:50,591 --> 01:09:53,810
But I know it's funny to me and the type
of people that I like to hang out with,

1524
01:09:54,170 --> 01:09:54,860
you know,
it's funny,

1525
01:09:54,861 --> 01:09:58,430
if it makes me laugh when you're dating 
someone that tries to kill him,

1526
01:09:58,431 --> 01:09:59,870
that undermine that.

1527
01:10:00,090 --> 01:10:00,900
Yeah.
You know,

1528
01:10:01,110 --> 01:10:06,030
and that's why I'm single like cars.
You find that happen.

1529
01:10:07,790 --> 01:10:12,790
What is it all just a woman saying if 
you say something that you would 

1530
01:10:12,790 --> 01:10:14,100
normally say to a point and they say,
that's not funny.

1531
01:10:14,490 --> 01:10:16,080
First of all,
I don't have to be funny every minute.

1532
01:10:16,180 --> 01:10:17,640
Right?
And if I'm not funny,

1533
01:10:17,641 --> 01:10:20,310
I don't need you to tell me that I hang 
out with people like,

1534
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:22,290
yeah,
so what are you doing?

1535
01:10:22,350 --> 01:10:23,340
Like.
And by the way,

1536
01:10:23,341 --> 01:10:25,920
sometimes you miss,
sometimes you miss and that's the,

1537
01:10:25,930 --> 01:10:29,550
that's the game.
But nobody's out there keeping score.

1538
01:10:29,551 --> 01:10:33,600
And then in like pounded in you that you
had an unfunny moment with them,

1539
01:10:34,020 --> 01:10:35,550
especially after you just made them 
laugh.

1540
01:10:35,710 --> 01:10:37,200
Like what's,
what is your problem?

1541
01:10:37,510 --> 01:10:42,510
Exactly.
How much lack of understanding do you 

1542
01:10:42,510 --> 01:10:42,510
know about the human condition?
Well,

1543
01:10:42,510 --> 01:10:44,050
you never said something that you 
thought was funny and it wasn't.

1544
01:10:44,230 --> 01:10:45,220
That's like part of life.

1545
01:10:45,550 --> 01:10:47,490
And then some of them girls cheat when 
it comes to funny,

1546
01:10:47,500 --> 01:10:50,890
like they'll say something and they'll 
laugh and I said I had just clowns.

1547
01:10:50,891 --> 01:10:55,390
You pitch,
you can't determine that.

1548
01:10:55,391 --> 01:11:00,391
It's funny because you said I have to be
laughing too.

1549
01:11:01,140 --> 01:11:06,140
That is funny.
Or I or when they try to give you a bit 

1550
01:11:06,140 --> 01:11:07,160
like that's funny you should say that on
stage sometime.

1551
01:11:07,190 --> 01:11:10,390
Ever had that.
My mom does that.

1552
01:11:10,770 --> 01:11:13,090
But do you know sometimes a woman will 
say something

1553
01:11:14,990 --> 01:11:18,840
and sometimes I'll be like mad that they
said something funny to help me.

1554
01:11:21,550 --> 01:11:22,560
Oh really?
That's funny.

1555
01:11:22,561 --> 01:11:24,810
Like she gives you some pointers and 
they work shit.

1556
01:11:25,370 --> 01:11:30,370
That is fucking funny you like because 
you just want to take it from you where 

1557
01:11:30,370 --> 01:11:31,170
you want to take it from.
Sometimes.

1558
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:31,980
Yeah,
that's true.

1559
01:11:31,981 --> 01:11:34,220
But you can get some good pointers even 
from idiots.

1560
01:11:34,380 --> 01:11:37,050
You can get some good pointers from 
people that you don't even respect.

1561
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:37,910
That's crazy.
Yeah,

1562
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:39,240
that's true.
I've had that happen.

1563
01:11:39,241 --> 01:11:41,610
I've had someone given me some good 
advice once.

1564
01:11:41,940 --> 01:11:44,360
I didn't want to hear it at all.
This guy was an idiot now.

1565
01:11:44,361 --> 01:11:45,660
Like did.
He gave me good advice,

1566
01:11:45,720 --> 01:11:50,520
he gave it to me into a tape recorder.
He was hanging out with another comedian

1567
01:11:50,521 --> 01:11:54,780
friend of mine and I had a tape recorder
and I put a tape recorder down and I was

1568
01:11:54,781 --> 01:11:59,781
recording my set and this dude picked up
a tape recorder and was given me notes 

1569
01:11:59,781 --> 01:12:00,930
on the tape recorder.

1570
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,480
You feel like you're taking,
talking too much about sex.

1571
01:12:03,730 --> 01:12:05,190
You're repeating yourself,
you're,

1572
01:12:05,191 --> 01:12:07,300
you're the.
And he said that like on,

1573
01:12:07,410 --> 01:12:12,410
on the recording.
I wish I saved it because she was like,

1574
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:13,140
no,
no,

1575
01:12:13,141 --> 01:12:14,020
no.
This is a long,

1576
01:12:14,130 --> 01:12:14,910
long,
long,

1577
01:12:14,911 --> 01:12:18,120
long time ago.
This was probably like 1991 or something

1578
01:12:18,121 --> 01:12:23,121
like that.
It was GRANDPA's on Staten Island and 

1579
01:12:23,121 --> 01:12:25,140
the dude was talking into my recorder 
and I'm like,

1580
01:12:25,141 --> 01:12:25,840
you know,
look man,

1581
01:12:25,890 --> 01:12:28,350
don't.
I don't want your fucking opinion.

1582
01:12:28,380 --> 01:12:30,570
Okay.
You don't need detail.

1583
01:12:30,620 --> 01:12:32,240
I didn't ask you.
I don't need to talk to them.

1584
01:12:32,290 --> 01:12:37,290
This is for me.
This recording is for me so I can go 

1585
01:12:37,290 --> 01:12:37,290
over my shit and decide what I think 
about it.

1586
01:12:37,290 --> 01:12:37,700
So violation.
Yeah.

1587
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:40,230
Not that I hear your voice saying what I
would.

1588
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:45,320
Maybe it wasn't a good set.
I didn't have a good set because I think

1589
01:12:45,400 --> 01:12:47,940
I'm fucked up the order of material or 
something.

1590
01:12:47,940 --> 01:12:50,340
There was some sort of error there,
but he was right.

1591
01:12:50,550 --> 01:12:52,080
Like what he sat on the recording was 
right.

1592
01:12:52,140 --> 01:12:57,140
Like he said,
like you're talking too much about this 

1593
01:12:57,140 --> 01:12:57,140
and you know,
you repeating yourself.

1594
01:12:57,140 --> 01:12:58,650
He's right because I fucked up one of my
bits or something.

1595
01:12:58,651 --> 01:13:02,240
Whatever I did,
I knew that this asshole and that's like

1596
01:13:02,900 --> 01:13:04,320
the worst.
He gave me.

1597
01:13:04,321 --> 01:13:05,500
Good advice though.
I mean it was,

1598
01:13:05,510 --> 01:13:08,220
it was really good advice from a 
douchebag that shouldn't have been given

1599
01:13:08,221 --> 01:13:12,360
advice.
You can accept that shit from people.

1600
01:13:12,361 --> 01:13:17,040
But I've been in relationships with 
people that like all they do,

1601
01:13:17,041 --> 01:13:22,041
like if you dated someone who's trying 
to be an act or something like that at 

1602
01:13:22,041 --> 01:13:24,830
all they do is talk about acting.
All they do is talk about that and 

1603
01:13:25,531 --> 01:13:26,630
about.
And they'll like,

1604
01:13:26,670 --> 01:13:30,540
they'll like fake talk to you.
Like it's almost like they're talking to

1605
01:13:30,541 --> 01:13:33,200
you and this is one of the weirdest 
things that an actor will do.

1606
01:13:33,560 --> 01:13:38,560
They're talking to you and they're 
pretending like they be talking to 

1607
01:13:38,560 --> 01:13:40,860
someone in an interview,
so they're talking to you,

1608
01:13:41,050 --> 01:13:45,540
but they're talking crazy bullshit like 
talking to me and like,

1609
01:13:45,541 --> 01:13:46,980
um,
what'd you think of the movie?

1610
01:13:47,340 --> 01:13:50,850
I thought her performance was stunning.
It's like there.

1611
01:13:52,170 --> 01:13:57,170
I thought she was amazing and I thought 
it was really powerful the way it was 

1612
01:13:57,661 --> 01:13:59,850
presented.
I felt like it was like,

1613
01:13:59,851 --> 01:14:03,030
what the fuck are you saying?
Who are you talking to you?

1614
01:14:03,031 --> 01:14:08,031
I would,
I could tell that this was like some 

1615
01:14:08,031 --> 01:14:10,730
weird speech because there's like a,
there's a mantra that gets chanted 

1616
01:14:11,501 --> 01:14:12,280
whenever anything

1617
01:14:12,280 --> 01:14:17,280
is successful in Hollywood and the 
people that want to be successful as 

1618
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:17,420
well.
They'll go along with the.

1619
01:14:17,421 --> 01:14:18,910
Yes,
good.

1620
01:14:19,060 --> 01:14:24,060
This is good.
Like whoever's good is it Daniel Day 

1621
01:14:24,060 --> 01:14:24,060
Lewis,
Daniel Day,

1622
01:14:24,060 --> 01:14:27,330
Lewis and Lewis,
and then everybody will chant that 

1623
01:14:27,330 --> 01:14:29,530
mantra and it gets to a point where you 
see people repeating these mantras,

1624
01:14:29,550 --> 01:14:31,120
patterns and conversations,
right?

1625
01:14:31,540 --> 01:14:36,540
Like it was an amazing film.
The powerful portrayal just shone light 

1626
01:14:36,581 --> 01:14:39,010
on that time period in a way that's in 
escapable.

1627
01:14:39,100 --> 01:14:39,930
Like the,
there's the,

1628
01:14:40,060 --> 01:14:42,670
there's shit in the way they're talking.
We're like,

1629
01:14:42,671 --> 01:14:45,310
I know what you're doing.
You're not really talking,

1630
01:14:45,450 --> 01:14:50,450
you're,
you're just using talking points that 

1631
01:14:50,450 --> 01:14:52,651
all these other actors in your acting 
class or saying they're all talking 

1632
01:14:52,651 --> 01:14:52,651
crazy talk.

1633
01:14:52,651 --> 01:14:56,820
Right.
It's funny like Hollywood is the only 

1634
01:14:56,820 --> 01:14:56,820
place where everybody.
Maybe it happens other places,

1635
01:14:56,820 --> 01:15:01,591
but like everybody like kind of has,
its not,

1636
01:15:02,160 --> 01:15:03,940
you know,
how style set trends,

1637
01:15:03,941 --> 01:15:06,310
but there's,
there's personality trends.

1638
01:15:06,380 --> 01:15:10,030
Like there was a time and I think people
still didn't like don't say that.

1639
01:15:10,031 --> 01:15:14,440
That's negative.
Like how the fuck is that negative?

1640
01:15:14,500 --> 01:15:16,960
Like you'll say something and just 
because.

1641
01:15:17,050 --> 01:15:19,480
Because it's real because it's real,
it's negative,

1642
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:24,520
it's real,
and a lot of times it's negative to not 

1643
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:24,520
say it.
And that's what I'm saying.

1644
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:25,780
That's why I always tell people,
well I'm so negative,

1645
01:15:25,781 --> 01:15:27,610
I'm positive that shit.

1646
01:15:28,050 --> 01:15:33,050
It's negative to not point out negative 
things because you're not contributing 

1647
01:15:33,050 --> 01:15:36,651
to fixing any problem that might exist.
That could be correctable if someone 

1648
01:15:36,651 --> 01:15:37,770
would address what the fuck is going on,
you know,

1649
01:15:38,520 --> 01:15:40,440
but yeah,
that don't be negative shit.

1650
01:15:40,441 --> 01:15:41,190
That was a big one for me.

1651
01:15:41,200 --> 01:15:46,200
That was a big one for a while.
He used to bug me and a is always 

1652
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:48,531
something or or just to the illegal use 
of the word like me and Patricia talks 

1653
01:15:48,531 --> 01:15:48,531
like I was like,
hey,

1654
01:15:48,780 --> 01:15:53,780
you can't say haters.
Like if you disagree with somebody or 

1655
01:15:53,780 --> 01:15:57,581
you're a hater,
what happened to when you could just 

1656
01:15:57,581 --> 01:15:57,581
disagree,
right?

1657
01:15:57,581 --> 01:16:01,380
Like,
and not be a heater like so I have to 

1658
01:16:01,380 --> 01:16:01,380
have your opinion on this.
I'm a hater.

1659
01:16:01,380 --> 01:16:02,080
Exactly.

1660
01:16:02,470 --> 01:16:02,920
Yeah.
Well,

1661
01:16:02,921 --> 01:16:04,930
and there's also.
Here's the thing.

1662
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:09,960
This is a way to express opinions in a 
respectful way and some people don't do 

1663
01:16:10,571 --> 01:16:11,710
that.
Some people,

1664
01:16:11,740 --> 01:16:16,740
if they disagree with you,
they do it in like they try to discount 

1665
01:16:16,740 --> 01:16:20,251
your point and like an insulting way and
haven't been to.

1666
01:16:22,020 --> 01:16:27,020
I think we all have been,
but that's one of the hardest things 

1667
01:16:27,020 --> 01:16:29,440
about accepting contrary ideas is a lot 
of times is the way they're presented.

1668
01:16:29,770 --> 01:16:32,050
If someone has a different point of view
than you,

1669
01:16:32,051 --> 01:16:35,170
especially if it's like a kid,
here's a hot button topic,

1670
01:16:35,510 --> 01:16:38,620
global warming,
you sit down with the wrong motherfucker

1671
01:16:38,621 --> 01:16:40,990
and talk about global warming and they 
will insult you.

1672
01:16:41,180 --> 01:16:43,480
They will find a way to to figure out 
like,

1673
01:16:43,720 --> 01:16:45,010
what side are you on?
You,

1674
01:16:45,040 --> 01:16:46,170
you know,
if you're,

1675
01:16:46,230 --> 01:16:51,230
if you're a Republican,
most likely you're siding with big 

1676
01:16:51,230 --> 01:16:51,230
business and you say,
well,

1677
01:16:51,230 --> 01:16:51,230
you know what?

1678
01:16:51,230 --> 01:16:56,010
The trends have shown that global 
warming is a natural cycle is repeated 

1679
01:16:56,010 --> 01:16:57,310
by the guy and they just repeat those 
talking points.

1680
01:16:57,580 --> 01:17:02,580
Or if you're someone who's a Democrat,
it's very likely you will get emotional 

1681
01:17:02,580 --> 01:17:06,781
and you say,
you think it's okay to fuck up this 

1682
01:17:06,781 --> 01:17:06,781
earth and fuck it up.
For my children.

1683
01:17:06,781 --> 01:17:08,370
I think you know,
and there's,

1684
01:17:08,530 --> 01:17:11,300
there's that point of view like the 
people that are extreme ecologist,

1685
01:17:11,390 --> 01:17:14,900
we need to all go vegan.
We need to all grow our own vegetables.

1686
01:17:16,010 --> 01:17:17,250
I don't know who's right,
right.

1687
01:17:17,260 --> 01:17:17,770
No,
I'm not.

1688
01:17:17,771 --> 01:17:19,220
I'm not neither one of those fucking 
people.

1689
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:24,760
But people fall into categories for real
easy and sometimes it's hard to find 

1690
01:17:26,660 --> 01:17:31,660
like a real person and the real opinion 
and a real point of view in the hot 

1691
01:17:31,660 --> 01:17:36,071
button topics.
Like whenever you got you talking about 

1692
01:17:36,071 --> 01:17:36,071
rape or you're talking about,
uh,

1693
01:17:36,071 --> 01:17:37,280
you know,
the environment,

1694
01:17:37,490 --> 01:17:39,680
violence,
gun control,

1695
01:17:39,681 --> 01:17:41,520
you're talking about gun control.
You just get to.

1696
01:17:44,540 --> 01:17:46,250
I was just thinking about the gun 
control thing.

1697
01:17:46,460 --> 01:17:47,210
Alright.
So let me,

1698
01:17:47,300 --> 01:17:48,380
let me ask what you're thinking about 
this.

1699
01:17:48,381 --> 01:17:53,381
So yesterday I tweeted that a stoney 
hook is the NRI and an Nras 9:11,

1700
01:17:58,250 --> 01:18:03,250
right?
Because there's like conspiracy 

1701
01:18:03,250 --> 01:18:03,250
theorists,
right?

1702
01:18:03,250 --> 01:18:03,530
They're saying that it was staged,
right?

1703
01:18:03,531 --> 01:18:05,770
I've seen that.
So video.

1704
01:18:05,771 --> 01:18:07,910
Fuck is that all about.
I'm like,

1705
01:18:08,180 --> 01:18:09,980
is that someone please someone debunk 
that.

1706
01:18:10,040 --> 01:18:13,040
It's got to be a debunked sandy hook 
thing.

1707
01:18:13,790 --> 01:18:16,220
Somebody sent me the video,
I was looking at that shit.

1708
01:18:16,430 --> 01:18:21,430
And then they were,
they were pointing out how the media 

1709
01:18:21,430 --> 01:18:24,530
story changed as the story of Stony 
Brook became,

1710
01:18:24,770 --> 01:18:28,280
you know.
But to me it's like one of the things in

1711
01:18:28,281 --> 01:18:32,480
the video was they said there were two 
shooters and they chased the guy through

1712
01:18:32,481 --> 01:18:34,520
the woods and then.
But to me it's like,

1713
01:18:34,730 --> 01:18:37,310
well,
the guy who's making a video,

1714
01:18:37,490 --> 01:18:42,490
like when a story first breaks,
there's gonna be differences in the 

1715
01:18:42,490 --> 01:18:44,810
story until they figure out what really,
really happened.

1716
01:18:44,900 --> 01:18:46,040
Yes.
You know what I'm saying?

1717
01:18:46,041 --> 01:18:49,670
So that I only watched like half and I 
got to finish watching the rest of it.

1718
01:18:49,671 --> 01:18:50,990
But so far it's like,
yeah,

1719
01:18:50,991 --> 01:18:54,500
they was inconsistency in the beginning,
but that's because it's the beginning.

1720
01:18:54,820 --> 01:18:57,980
Like later on.
And then they had the father,

1721
01:18:58,160 --> 01:19:03,160
the father of emily who did his speech 
and it was a great speech about his 

1722
01:19:03,160 --> 01:19:03,950
daughter.
And uh,

1723
01:19:04,790 --> 01:19:05,480
he went up

1724
01:19:05,580 --> 01:19:07,270
and they were making it seem like he was
faking it.

1725
01:19:07,280 --> 01:19:09,210
Like he was faking the speech.
Listen man,

1726
01:19:09,211 --> 01:19:14,211
you got into,
you imagine how bad it would make that 

1727
01:19:14,211 --> 01:19:15,660
guy feel if his daughter was murdered by
a cycle.

1728
01:19:15,720 --> 01:19:18,450
And then people accused him of lying,
right?

1729
01:19:18,660 --> 01:19:22,230
And then based on what?
Based on you looking at him,

1730
01:19:22,260 --> 01:19:25,080
talking where he smiled a little bit 
before he talked.

1731
01:19:25,410 --> 01:19:28,890
People deal with grief very differently.
Some people bawl their eyes out,

1732
01:19:28,891 --> 01:19:31,770
some people joke around about it,
and then just get it home and sit in the

1733
01:19:31,771 --> 01:19:34,110
fucking dark and,
and cry by themselves.

1734
01:19:34,111 --> 01:19:34,860
I mean,
who,

1735
01:19:35,460 --> 01:19:39,390
who the fuck knows how you would react 
if your baby got shot down like that?

1736
01:19:39,460 --> 01:19:44,460
That'd be so fucked up.
And for all these so called experts to 

1737
01:19:44,850 --> 01:19:48,330
be so insensitive when you're dealing 
with something so horrific.

1738
01:19:48,420 --> 01:19:48,600
You know?

1739
01:19:49,410 --> 01:19:51,400
So the crazy thing is it's more fucked 
up.

1740
01:19:51,760 --> 01:19:54,550
Like the video is more fucked up than 
the shooting.

1741
01:19:54,610 --> 01:19:58,270
Like you think the shooter was crazy for
you to make this video.

1742
01:19:58,540 --> 01:19:59,750
That's fucking.

1743
01:20:00,020 --> 01:20:02,180
He's got.
This is my opinion that you got.

1744
01:20:02,181 --> 01:20:03,680
If you're going to say something like 
that,

1745
01:20:03,710 --> 01:20:08,710
you got to be really fucking chore.
If you're saying that someone's faking 

1746
01:20:08,710 --> 01:20:09,450
and their daughter wasn't really killed 
and they're just an actor,

1747
01:20:09,780 --> 01:20:12,000
man,
you better fucking go and do the work.

1748
01:20:12,030 --> 01:20:17,030
You better had photos of this guy.
Where you see him in the production of 

1749
01:20:17,030 --> 01:20:20,421
hamlet and you know,
this is real fucking name and this is 

1750
01:20:20,421 --> 01:20:23,391
where he lives.
You can't just speculate and say it 

1751
01:20:23,391 --> 01:20:23,391
doesn't look like he's sad.

1752
01:20:23,391 --> 01:20:24,420
Right?
That's crazy.

1753
01:20:24,510 --> 01:20:29,510
Or what about that guy that found all 
those kids at the end of his driveway 

1754
01:20:29,510 --> 01:20:32,421
and then just like took him inside and 
hung out with them and he's getting 

1755
01:20:32,421 --> 01:20:34,050
harassed and his story's changing too.
Well,

1756
01:20:34,080 --> 01:20:34,860
he,
he said,

1757
01:20:34,861 --> 01:20:35,820
uh,
I didn't hear that.

1758
01:20:35,821 --> 01:20:37,590
It's the only thing that bothers me 
about his story.

1759
01:20:37,591 --> 01:20:41,090
So they say this guy is a hero because 
he came outside,

1760
01:20:41,140 --> 01:20:46,140
there was six kids on his lawn and he 
took them in his house and gave them 

1761
01:20:46,140 --> 01:20:49,941
toys and kept them safe.
But when he found than they will with a 

1762
01:20:49,941 --> 01:20:51,540
bus driver who took them away from the 
scene.

1763
01:20:51,870 --> 01:20:54,120
So why isn't the bus driver hero?
But then you know,

1764
01:20:54,121 --> 01:20:56,540
he's crying about the kids and cool,
okay,

1765
01:20:56,541 --> 01:20:56,940
this,
this,

1766
01:20:56,941 --> 01:21:01,941
that's just a moot point.
So then now the conspiracy theories or 

1767
01:21:01,941 --> 01:21:03,230
hitting him and saying,
well,

1768
01:21:03,240 --> 01:21:06,240
his story changed at first it wasn't a 
bus driver or something like that.

1769
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:10,940
You can't rely on people when people say
the story changes and plus you didn't.

1770
01:21:10,950 --> 01:21:12,780
It doesn't change.
It just.

1771
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:14,310
It's just you don't know what's going 
on.

1772
01:21:14,330 --> 01:21:19,330
Right.
How many times have you told a bad 

1773
01:21:19,330 --> 01:21:21,741
store?
You remember you have ever said 

1774
01:21:21,741 --> 01:21:21,741
something and someone will say,
no,

1775
01:21:21,741 --> 01:21:21,741
no,
no.

1776
01:21:21,741 --> 01:21:22,570
We were in Phoenix.
Oh yeah,

1777
01:21:23,050 --> 01:21:25,030
yeah.
That happens all the time.

1778
01:21:25,070 --> 01:21:30,070
They get you in court.
That's why prosecutors like he changed 

1779
01:21:30,070 --> 01:21:30,320
his story soon because first of all,
you asked.

1780
01:21:30,360 --> 01:21:31,890
I didn't even know what the fuck you was
asking me.

1781
01:21:32,190 --> 01:21:32,590
It's like

1782
01:21:33,920 --> 01:21:38,410
testimony is notoriously unreliable.
Notoriously it doesn't.

1783
01:21:38,570 --> 01:21:41,090
The people see the shit that didn't 
really happen.

1784
01:21:41,091 --> 01:21:43,520
Sometimes they freak out,
they hear things,

1785
01:21:43,521 --> 01:21:45,440
they repeat the things they heard.
Those things become.

1786
01:21:45,441 --> 01:21:47,900
Gossip becomes.
It Becomes Gospel,

1787
01:21:47,901 --> 01:21:48,360
you know?
No,

1788
01:21:48,361 --> 01:21:48,710
no,
no.

1789
01:21:48,740 --> 01:21:50,930
There are three shooters,
three shooters in the building.

1790
01:21:51,480 --> 01:21:52,160
What the fuck?
No.

1791
01:21:52,161 --> 01:21:53,190
You know,
how do you know?

1792
01:21:54,090 --> 01:21:59,090
How do they got the one guy?
You see the one guy go in and start 

1793
01:21:59,090 --> 01:21:59,090
shooting people?
Did you watch the whole thing?

1794
01:21:59,090 --> 01:22:03,210
If you didn't,
then you don't know that there's only 

1795
01:22:03,210 --> 01:22:03,210
one guy when you the police and you get 
there,

1796
01:22:03,210 --> 01:22:04,500
the only thing you know is every shoot 
is in the building.

1797
01:22:04,530 --> 01:22:06,360
And the people that met the shit of 
dead.

1798
01:22:06,440 --> 01:22:07,950
Yeah.
And the people had escaped.

1799
01:22:07,980 --> 01:22:10,190
They were trying to run for their lives.
So you try like,

1800
01:22:10,700 --> 01:22:15,700
how do you.
You don't know what the fuck is going 

1801
01:22:15,700 --> 01:22:15,700
on,
what the fuck is going?

1802
01:22:15,700 --> 01:22:15,700
You don't know what the fuck is going on
either.

1803
01:22:15,700 --> 01:22:16,020
You don't know who's doing it.
Right.

1804
01:22:16,110 --> 01:22:19,470
And I and I know that I'm unreliable 
like this.

1805
01:22:19,471 --> 01:22:24,471
Things that I thought I remembered the 
way they went and later on realize that 

1806
01:22:24,471 --> 01:22:25,290
they didn't.
And I have to come to terms with that.

1807
01:22:25,610 --> 01:22:28,800
Like Damn my memory is not as great as I
thought it was.

1808
01:22:29,240 --> 01:22:34,240
What's really scary that people think 
that the government would be so corrupt 

1809
01:22:34,240 --> 01:22:39,131
that they'd be willing to either murder 
kids or there's no real murders,

1810
01:22:39,741 --> 01:22:41,300
I think.
And they think that they could pull this

1811
01:22:41,301 --> 01:22:46,301
off.
Like I've heard those two conspiracies 

1812
01:22:46,301 --> 01:22:47,630
that someone is hired and this is all to
take our guns away.

1813
01:22:47,710 --> 01:22:49,770
Right.
And then the idea is that in,

1814
01:22:49,780 --> 01:22:54,780
in doing this,
what they're going to do is they're 

1815
01:22:54,780 --> 01:22:56,000
going to get people so freaked out that 
they're gonna be able to disarm them and

1816
01:22:56,001 --> 01:22:58,580
then the tyrannical governments going to
take over.

1817
01:22:58,600 --> 01:23:01,160
Right.
It's really weird.

1818
01:23:01,550 --> 01:23:04,600
Were these kids in a petri dish?
They started at seven years ago.

1819
01:23:04,840 --> 01:23:05,670
You know what I mean?
Like

1820
01:23:06,480 --> 01:23:11,480
something terrence parents went on 
television and talked about their 

1821
01:23:11,480 --> 01:23:12,580
children's not like,
you know what I mean?

1822
01:23:12,581 --> 01:23:14,210
Like actual human beings.
It's,

1823
01:23:14,380 --> 01:23:19,380
you cannot have.
And this doesn't even exist in 

1824
01:23:19,380 --> 01:23:19,380
Connecticut.
She just put it in my head.

1825
01:23:19,380 --> 01:23:23,350
The whole thing's a big CIA plot.
I've been on the show homeland.

1826
01:23:23,351 --> 01:23:25,440
I finished the second,
second season.

1827
01:23:26,290 --> 01:23:27,460
God Damn,
that's a good show.

1828
01:23:27,820 --> 01:23:28,660
I've heard people say,
oh,

1829
01:23:28,661 --> 01:23:33,340
it's called and moves with one small 
words.

1830
01:23:33,490 --> 01:23:37,250
So good fucking show that Claire Danes 
asked her hits off.

1831
01:23:37,360 --> 01:23:40,570
Did you ever watch a Joe Schmo show back
in the day?

1832
01:23:40,780 --> 01:23:41,400
Yeah,
yeah,

1833
01:23:41,410 --> 01:23:42,640
yeah.
That was the show where they,

1834
01:23:42,641 --> 01:23:43,830
um,
they had uh,

1835
01:23:43,880 --> 01:23:48,880
uh,
one guy who thought he was on a reality 

1836
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:48,880
show and everybody else was actors or 
they're doing another one right now,

1837
01:23:49,560 --> 01:23:51,630
favorite show ever.
And then I met was at bear Chrysler,

1838
01:23:51,650 --> 01:23:54,120
his house when we killed that pig and 
ate it and stuff.

1839
01:23:54,121 --> 01:23:59,121
And I met the executive producer that 
Schubert killed a pig at his house as 

1840
01:23:59,121 --> 01:23:59,121
well.
No,

1841
01:23:59,121 --> 01:24:00,980
they just cooked it and skinned it 
alive.

1842
01:24:01,540 --> 01:24:02,130
I was like,
wow,

1843
01:24:02,131 --> 01:24:07,131
that's gangster.
But I met the producer guy of the show 

1844
01:24:07,131 --> 01:24:07,131
and I was like,
so happy.

1845
01:24:07,131 --> 01:24:09,450
That's one of the few shows that I just 
loved the idea,

1846
01:24:09,820 --> 01:24:10,380
loved.
Remember when,

1847
01:24:10,410 --> 01:24:13,320
I don't know if you remember Brian from 
one of the first episode,

1848
01:24:13,321 --> 01:24:18,321
he used to hang out at the comedy store 
all the time and he was at main 

1849
01:24:18,321 --> 01:24:18,321
character,
the first series,

1850
01:24:18,321 --> 01:24:21,120
Natasha Leggiero is second thing,
but I was sick yesterday,

1851
01:24:21,121 --> 01:24:26,121
so I went home and watched the marathon 
of the first four episodes of the new 

1852
01:24:26,121 --> 01:24:27,390
one and do it.
It's so fucking hilarious,

1853
01:24:27,391 --> 01:24:28,800
man.
You have to check it out.

1854
01:24:29,110 --> 01:24:32,160
The one main guy does that podcast with 
Kevin Smith,

1855
01:24:32,310 --> 01:24:35,370
a Hollywood Babylon.
I can't remember his name,

1856
01:24:35,610 --> 01:24:37,740
but he's like the main guy.
Check this.

1857
01:24:37,770 --> 01:24:39,690
Check this part out.
This trailer here.

1858
01:24:39,980 --> 01:24:44,160
It's funny.
It's honestly,

1859
01:24:44,161 --> 01:24:45,090
I think chase thing.

1860
01:24:45,290 --> 01:24:50,290
Remember Lorenzo Limos today.
We're going to use all of this to our 

1861
01:24:50,891 --> 01:24:53,410
advantage to see him.
Chase actually has a dark side

1862
01:24:55,070 --> 01:24:56,840
guy right there.
He's the only one that thinks this.

1863
01:24:56,890 --> 01:24:59,900
A reality shows real.
Everyone else has paid actors,

1864
01:25:00,020 --> 01:25:05,020
so the whole reality show is that 
there's only one guy that thinks he's 

1865
01:25:05,020 --> 01:25:05,020
actually in the reality show.

1866
01:25:05,380 --> 01:25:10,380
Nice.
I kind of want to be the guy on the 

1867
01:25:10,380 --> 01:25:11,630
reality show whose name you might not 
learn until episode seven,

1868
01:25:12,170 --> 01:25:17,170
who's kind of the opposite of Lorenzo 
Lamas and just kind of flies under the 

1869
01:25:17,170 --> 01:25:17,170
radar.

1870
01:25:22,750 --> 01:25:26,810
Ralph Garman in this as well.
The guy from a red state,

1871
01:25:27,140 --> 01:25:32,140
he was in red state.
He's in Hollywood Babylon.

1872
01:25:33,860 --> 01:25:37,630
I her to talk to you about maybe helping
me today.

1873
01:25:40,280 --> 01:25:41,390
Damn.
Lorenzo alumnus.

1874
01:25:41,391 --> 01:25:46,391
Let himself go little.
You got a little sloppy on that girl.

1875
01:25:47,431 --> 01:25:52,431
I played depths.
There's an access that actually has to 

1876
01:25:52,431 --> 01:25:52,431
play deaf and she keeps on fucking up 
because like,

1877
01:25:52,431 --> 01:25:54,840
like champagne bottle will snap off and 
she'll react,

1878
01:25:54,850 --> 01:25:57,710
but you shouldn't have to work their way
out of that.

1879
01:25:59,250 --> 01:26:01,670
Damn.
Lorenzo got all sloppy.

1880
01:26:03,190 --> 01:26:04,370
You don't have to be sunning

1881
01:26:04,370 --> 01:26:09,370
or swimming.
Lorenzo and acts like he owns a company 

1882
01:26:09,370 --> 01:26:10,590
that sells these things called a 
European bio or something.

1883
01:26:12,560 --> 01:26:15,740
Look at this guy,
this gay black dude,

1884
01:26:16,550 --> 01:26:19,200
and he kind hit.
Is it a really gay black dude?

1885
01:26:19,201 --> 01:26:21,980
As a actor?
I don't think he might be really good.

1886
01:26:22,490 --> 01:26:26,600
So he's an actor.
He's an actor that's gay and gay in real

1887
01:26:26,601 --> 01:26:27,970
life.
I think they're all.

1888
01:26:28,020 --> 01:26:30,890
They're all walking around for the folks
listening on itunes like,

1889
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:35,960
what the fuck are they saying?
It's a bunch of dudes were in speedos 

1890
01:26:35,960 --> 01:26:39,400
walking around.
That's the whole joke is that they're 

1891
01:26:39,400 --> 01:26:39,400
wearing speedos and you think this is 
awesome.

1892
01:26:39,400 --> 01:26:40,980
No know what they're doing is because 
one of the character Lorenzo,

1893
01:26:41,400 --> 01:26:43,210
he has a speedo company.
Right?

1894
01:26:43,270 --> 01:26:48,270
And know I heard all that and what 
they're trying to do is they're trying 

1895
01:26:48,270 --> 01:26:48,570
to make the real guy put a speedo on 
speed.

1896
01:26:48,920 --> 01:26:51,470
That's what the whole show is.
It's like fucking with this guy.

1897
01:26:52,300 --> 01:26:57,300
The whole show is.
I just don't think this is very 

1898
01:26:57,300 --> 01:26:57,300
interesting.
It's a bunch of idiots in speedos.

1899
01:26:57,300 --> 01:26:58,970
I know what you're saying,
but it's a good show.

1900
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,220
You got to check it out.
I'm just saying TV shows,

1901
01:27:01,221 --> 01:27:04,520
working for them or something.
But go to the olive garden.

1902
01:27:04,521 --> 01:27:06,110
[inaudible].
They have this new two for 25 now.

1903
01:27:06,440 --> 01:27:08,780
But no,
I'm just saying I watched like the first

1904
01:27:08,781 --> 01:27:10,880
four episodes of this and it's really 
fucking good.

1905
01:27:10,881 --> 01:27:11,930
If you're looking for a new TC

1906
01:27:12,740 --> 01:27:15,470
prank shows.
Do you like watching people lie?

1907
01:27:16,370 --> 01:27:21,370
I mean I liked punk.
You know what I used to like Jamie 

1908
01:27:21,370 --> 01:27:24,010
Kennedy experience.
Jamie Kennedy experiment was the 

1909
01:27:24,010 --> 01:27:24,010
experiment,
right?

1910
01:27:24,010 --> 01:27:24,400
Yeah.
That was a.

1911
01:27:24,410 --> 01:27:26,810
That was a good fucking show.
That was a good fucking show.

1912
01:27:26,870 --> 01:27:31,870
That guy did some crazy shit man.
When he had those guys sign up for a 

1913
01:27:31,870 --> 01:27:32,270
boy's gun.
Nuts.

1914
01:27:32,310 --> 01:27:37,310
You know,
there was the boy version of girls gone 

1915
01:27:37,310 --> 01:27:37,560
wild boys got nuts and they're like,
you're going to be on police.

1916
01:27:37,580 --> 01:27:42,580
Got nuts.
And they like talked him into doing gay 

1917
01:27:42,580 --> 01:27:42,580
shit.
Like they told them,

1918
01:27:42,580 --> 01:27:45,761
you know,
we wouldn't even have to do some gay 

1919
01:27:45,761 --> 01:27:47,531
shit and you know,
these guys are on camera and like all 

1920
01:27:47,531 --> 01:27:47,531
right,
like they think it's real.

1921
01:27:47,531 --> 01:27:51,940
They were agreeing to do some gay shit 
for money and so that is like on camera 

1922
01:27:51,940 --> 01:27:55,901
for ever.
You can always tap into people wanting 

1923
01:27:55,901 --> 01:27:55,901
to be famous who doesn't do that 
anymore.

1924
01:27:55,901 --> 01:27:58,050
But it does stand up.
But I don't hear anybody talking about a

1925
01:27:58,051 --> 01:28:03,051
standup.
The way I heard people talking about 

1926
01:28:03,051 --> 01:28:03,051
that show,
that show was a crook.

1927
01:28:03,051 --> 01:28:06,640
He was really good at that man.
I mean I think I just moved to la or 

1928
01:28:06,640 --> 01:28:07,100
something.
I don't know,

1929
01:28:07,130 --> 01:28:08,930
but I'm just amazed that he stopped 
doing it.

1930
01:28:08,931 --> 01:28:13,931
That was a good fighter.
She's heck maybe annoyed me because he 

1931
01:28:13,931 --> 01:28:18,071
didn't have hecklers.
It's like if you're going to make a 

1932
01:28:18,071 --> 01:28:19,070
heckler movie and talk about heckling,
at least have real heckler footage.

1933
01:28:19,280 --> 01:28:20,240
Well,
he had a little bit of it,

1934
01:28:20,241 --> 01:28:23,540
but it has a lot of critics.
It was more critics and hecklers,

1935
01:28:25,060 --> 01:28:26,210
you know,
like fake.

1936
01:28:26,270 --> 01:28:28,720
It was filmed is what I heard it was.
Hmm.

1937
01:28:28,960 --> 01:28:30,980
I Dunno.
I mean I think he got actual people that

1938
01:28:30,981 --> 01:28:35,981
gave him bad reviews,
but there's nothing wrong with someone 

1939
01:28:35,981 --> 01:28:35,981
giving you a bad review.

1940
01:28:35,981 --> 01:28:39,280
I mean everybody's got different tastes 
and his standup's not the strongest in 

1941
01:28:39,280 --> 01:28:39,280
the world.
So it's like,

1942
01:28:39,470 --> 01:28:41,000
what are you trying to say?
You know,

1943
01:28:41,400 --> 01:28:42,390
the.
Is it,

1944
01:28:42,400 --> 01:28:44,540
is it a review thing or is it a heckle 
thing?

1945
01:28:44,541 --> 01:28:49,541
Because the problem with heckling is 
you're interrupting a performance and 

1946
01:28:49,541 --> 01:28:50,000
you're being rude and you think that 
you're bad ass and you know,

1947
01:28:50,001 --> 01:28:51,830
you think you're funnier than the show 
and so you,

1948
01:28:52,160 --> 01:28:53,450
that's us.
You're,

1949
01:28:53,520 --> 01:28:57,710
you're fucking up the whole agreement 
that an audience has with a performer.

1950
01:28:57,980 --> 01:29:02,980
You know when you're sitting in the 
audience and you're watching a bad 

1951
01:29:02,980 --> 01:29:02,980
comedian,
you can yell at him

1952
01:29:02,980 --> 01:29:06,440
and fucking and kill if you want it to,
but you would never do that because it's

1953
01:29:06,630 --> 01:29:08,250
an agreement when you're in the 
audience,

1954
01:29:08,490 --> 01:29:10,140
you'd behave as an audience member 
would.

1955
01:29:10,350 --> 01:29:15,350
When you're on stage,
you do your fucking act and if you 

1956
01:29:15,350 --> 01:29:15,350
hackle your account,
it's really that simple.

1957
01:29:15,350 --> 01:29:16,800
That's the.
That's the whole formula.

1958
01:29:17,130 --> 01:29:21,090
The only time it's not bad,
it's when someone's doing it.

1959
01:29:21,091 --> 01:29:26,091
Good naturedly they got a couple of 
drinks and I'm gonna yell something out 

1960
01:29:26,091 --> 01:29:26,220
and it might be funny.
There's nothing wrong with that.

1961
01:29:26,340 --> 01:29:31,340
It's when someone is like intentionally 
fucking with you or insulting you and 

1962
01:29:31,340 --> 01:29:33,240
trying to throw you off of the 
performance,

1963
01:29:33,270 --> 01:29:35,850
trying to stop you or demanding 
attention,

1964
01:29:35,851 --> 01:29:37,650
unwanted attention for themselves.

1965
01:29:37,760 --> 01:29:42,760
You ever had that accident?
I guess you have like the accidentally 

1966
01:29:42,760 --> 01:29:46,231
good heckler where they're not heckling 
you per say they are,

1967
01:29:46,750 --> 01:29:49,030
but they're while you're setting up your
joke,

1968
01:29:49,090 --> 01:29:50,090
they always seen,

1969
01:29:50,450 --> 01:29:51,210
oh yeah,
yeah.

1970
01:29:52,470 --> 01:29:54,970
And it throws off your timing.
It's like,

1971
01:29:55,310 --> 01:29:57,260
how the fuck did you learn how to do 
that?

1972
01:29:57,261 --> 01:30:02,261
Shit?
You ever see comics that you thought 

1973
01:30:02,261 --> 01:30:04,271
were really funny back in the day and 
then you see them today and they're 

1974
01:30:04,271 --> 01:30:07,211
like,
still like relying on like old stupid 

1975
01:30:07,211 --> 01:30:09,941
tricks and you see their jokes coming a 
mile away and you get really 

1976
01:30:09,941 --> 01:30:09,941
disappointed.
Yeah.

1977
01:30:09,941 --> 01:30:12,940
I'm watched some dudes on TV the other 
day and uh,

1978
01:30:12,950 --> 01:30:16,070
I was just sitting there watching this 
guy set and I was like,

1979
01:30:16,400 --> 01:30:18,680
and then you're going to say that and he
said that.

1980
01:30:19,420 --> 01:30:19,900
And then,
um,

1981
01:30:19,940 --> 01:30:22,790
I mean it wasn't even like,
like lobs.

1982
01:30:22,880 --> 01:30:25,310
I mean he's just rolling balls on the 
ground.

1983
01:30:25,311 --> 01:30:26,840
He wasn't even trying to get them over 
the plate.

1984
01:30:26,841 --> 01:30:31,841
I was like,
some people like they get to a certain 

1985
01:30:31,841 --> 01:30:31,841
point in time where they just fuck.
It looks like they stopped trying.

1986
01:30:31,880 --> 01:30:32,210
I guess

1987
01:30:32,280 --> 01:30:34,980
that's my,
that's like I used to watch boxing a lot

1988
01:30:35,150 --> 01:30:39,750
and then you can realize when there's a 
shock boxer had one fight too many.

1989
01:30:40,230 --> 01:30:45,230
And I remember a guy named,
his name was Gerard Washington.

1990
01:30:45,420 --> 01:30:50,420
Now the first time I seen him perform he
killed and then everybody went up to him

1991
01:30:52,261 --> 01:30:53,010
afterwards.
I mean,

1992
01:30:53,011 --> 01:30:58,011
he ripped the place apart and we'd been 
doing it like two or three years and 

1993
01:30:58,011 --> 01:30:58,011
say,
how many times you've done it?

1994
01:30:58,011 --> 01:30:58,500
He said,
it's the second time.

1995
01:30:58,910 --> 01:30:59,880
It was like,
Whoa,

1996
01:30:59,940 --> 01:31:02,610
shit,
this motherfucker in any,

1997
01:31:02,630 --> 01:31:03,300
any,
any.

1998
01:31:03,350 --> 01:31:05,670
He started doing shows around town and 
Harlem is head.

1999
01:31:05,671 --> 01:31:07,890
He's just ripping.
Then he quit,

2000
01:31:07,891 --> 01:31:12,891
became an ems worker and shit and then 
got married and then came back and he 

2001
01:31:13,540 --> 01:31:15,720
threw the show in Queens.
He had a room in Queens.

2002
01:31:15,721 --> 01:31:20,721
I used to go to the room and then I used
to rip the room and then he used to go 

2003
01:31:20,721 --> 01:31:23,751
up and he used to do bad and he was 
doing the same material from before and 

2004
01:31:25,170 --> 01:31:27,420
there was something missing.
You don't know what it is,

2005
01:31:27,800 --> 01:31:32,800
but in all my life,
my fear is to not make that thing that 

2006
01:31:32,800 --> 01:31:33,060
was missing from him.
Be Missing from me.

2007
01:31:34,240 --> 01:31:36,840
You know what I'm saying?
Make sure you don't catch it.

2008
01:31:36,890 --> 01:31:38,610
Catch.
Catch like it's tough,

2009
01:31:38,611 --> 01:31:39,690
man.
Whoa.

2010
01:31:39,691 --> 01:31:42,630
Almost every great comedian except 
prior.

2011
01:31:42,900 --> 01:31:45,750
Prior was the only one who kept,
in my opinion,

2012
01:31:45,751 --> 01:31:48,530
getting better and the strongest 
material is the.

2013
01:31:48,531 --> 01:31:53,531
The later material,
even like it's like some live in the 

2014
01:31:53,531 --> 01:31:53,531
sunset strip,
some of the strongest shit ever,

2015
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:59,000
but you know,
and then you'd go back to his early 

2016
01:31:59,000 --> 01:31:59,000
stuff.
It was still all like really strong,

2017
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:00,130
but like Kennison man Kennison

2018
01:32:00,130 --> 01:32:05,130
had one good cd while or it wasn't even 
a CD because I don't think warner 

2019
01:32:05,130 --> 01:32:09,031
brothers wanted to release it on cd 
because it was so offensive to gay 

2020
01:32:09,031 --> 01:32:09,670
people,
but it was louder than hell.

2021
01:32:10,150 --> 01:32:15,150
Kennison had one hbo special that was 
not quite as good as louder than hell 

2022
01:32:15,150 --> 01:32:19,770
but pretty close.
And then from there it was a slide from 

2023
01:32:19,770 --> 01:32:20,490
the HBO special.
It was like he had,

2024
01:32:20,560 --> 01:32:25,560
he had a Rodney dangerfield sat and he 
had an hour to hour still fucking bad 

2025
01:32:25,560 --> 01:32:26,410
ass.
To this day I still watch that and laugh

2026
01:32:26,411 --> 01:32:31,411
your ass off,
but it's still not quite as good as 

2027
01:32:31,411 --> 01:32:31,411
louder than hell.
The cassette,

2028
01:32:31,411 --> 01:32:33,700
the cassette was just on fire.
It was just him,

2029
01:32:33,850 --> 01:32:38,850
you know,
doing performances at different clubs 

2030
01:32:38,850 --> 01:32:38,850
all over the country.
And it was all spliced together.

2031
01:32:38,850 --> 01:32:41,350
It was ending.
He was just the best shit.

2032
01:32:41,470 --> 01:32:45,520
But then if you listen to like the stuff
from like to not even a year later,

2033
01:32:45,521 --> 01:32:47,710
two years later,
the next whatever the next cd was,

2034
01:32:48,430 --> 01:32:53,430
it's like a copycat of his old act.
It's like somebody,

2035
01:32:54,970 --> 01:32:59,970
yeah,
somebody pretending to be him and his 

2036
01:32:59,970 --> 01:33:02,391
him like a dumb guy.
Like a dumb guys got the reins now and 

2037
01:33:02,391 --> 01:33:04,360
then he's going to make stuff that's 
like barely amusing

2038
01:33:04,470 --> 01:33:05,090
he's got.

2039
01:33:07,350 --> 01:33:08,320
And it's just like,
man,

2040
01:33:08,321 --> 01:33:10,300
if you,
if you looked at that like as a store,

2041
01:33:10,301 --> 01:33:12,040
like the structure of that,
it's like,

2042
01:33:12,041 --> 01:33:13,850
so lacking in a joke structure.
Yeah.

2043
01:33:13,900 --> 01:33:15,520
You can go back to like his,
like,

2044
01:33:15,521 --> 01:33:17,050
um,
the Ethiopia bit,

2045
01:33:17,200 --> 01:33:22,200
which is a,
that's the one that's on louder than 

2046
01:33:22,200 --> 01:33:22,200
hell.
I don't think it's on the um,

2047
01:33:22,200 --> 01:33:26,200
I don't know if it's on his hbo special,
but that Ethiopia bit is fucked up

2048
01:33:26,590 --> 01:33:28,980
where he's already at a point.
Yeah,

2049
01:33:28,990 --> 01:33:31,790
he had a great point.
It's like he goes,

2050
01:33:31,791 --> 01:33:36,791
you know,
we just drove here with your friend to 

2051
01:33:36,791 --> 01:33:39,131
us.
It wouldn't be if you see that,

2052
01:33:41,490 --> 01:33:45,290
don't want to know.
It's going to be 100 years now.

2053
01:33:45,320 --> 01:33:48,080
Fuck.
We got deserts in America too,

2054
01:33:48,260 --> 01:33:53,260
we just don't,
and he was just destroying and he made,

2055
01:33:54,940 --> 01:33:55,310
he had a the

2056
01:33:55,350 --> 01:34:00,350
point and it was like he thought it out 
and it was fucked up that he was saying 

2057
01:34:00,350 --> 01:34:01,200
it,
but it was still funny.

2058
01:34:01,770 --> 01:34:06,770
And then he went from that to just like,
I guess too much coke and too much 

2059
01:34:06,770 --> 01:34:08,370
parties.
He got really fat.

2060
01:34:08,400 --> 01:34:11,030
He looked like,
like rotund onstage,

2061
01:34:11,250 --> 01:34:16,250
you know,
he became like a caricature and then he 

2062
01:34:16,250 --> 01:34:16,250
just was never the same guy again.
He was like,

2063
01:34:16,250 --> 01:34:19,410
he got by the same way and old rock band
gets by.

2064
01:34:19,470 --> 01:34:22,600
But he did it over just a few years.
Like if,

2065
01:34:23,060 --> 01:34:24,970
if his health was okay,
like we,

2066
01:34:25,010 --> 01:34:29,010
we could have seen the better years of 
Kennison after he became famous.

2067
01:34:29,280 --> 01:34:34,280
I mean if he could keep it up,
but his type of party in like that 

2068
01:34:34,280 --> 01:34:35,190
cocaine and whiskey partying,
it became about the party.

2069
01:34:35,191 --> 01:34:39,030
I remember seeing that Jay Jimmy's 
comedy alley in Queens and Queens,

2070
01:34:39,031 --> 01:34:42,360
like two years after,
like the funny Shit,

2071
01:34:42,390 --> 01:34:43,190
you know?
Oh,

2072
01:34:43,200 --> 01:34:46,110
when it was going away and doing smaller
venues again,

2073
01:34:46,880 --> 01:34:51,600
like I saw him twice,
three times,

2074
01:34:51,630 --> 01:34:54,200
some three times live and he got worse 
every time a song,

2075
01:34:54,380 --> 01:34:57,000
whereas everything it got got Saturn,
Saturn,

2076
01:34:57,110 --> 01:34:58,310
the opening acts get shittier

2077
01:34:58,310 --> 01:34:59,480
and Shittier.
It was bad.

2078
01:34:59,720 --> 01:35:01,280
Like the one of the last times I saw 
him,

2079
01:35:01,281 --> 01:35:03,560
it was just not a good shot.
You wanted to laugh,

2080
01:35:03,590 --> 01:35:06,200
but there was no opportunities.
Just it just wasn't good.

2081
01:35:06,590 --> 01:35:11,510
And then his last thing that he did,
I think it was like a CD.

2082
01:35:11,690 --> 01:35:16,690
It's a lot of things not that bad,
but if you compare it to like louder 

2083
01:35:16,690 --> 01:35:16,690
than hell.
Yes.

2084
01:35:16,690 --> 01:35:16,850
The funny thing,
you can compare it,

2085
01:35:16,851 --> 01:35:21,851
that's the only problem you can't get 
louder than hell was fucking 

2086
01:35:21,851 --> 01:35:23,570
outstanding.
I think he was the best comic ever for a

2087
01:35:23,570 --> 01:35:25,910
year.
That's what I think for one year,

2088
01:35:26,210 --> 01:35:31,210
but overall I would say prior,
prior just overall he changed the whole 

2089
01:35:31,581 --> 01:35:35,270
style of comedy that people did.
Opened him up,

2090
01:35:35,330 --> 01:35:40,330
opened himself up in a vulnerable way on
stage and nobody had ever come close to 

2091
01:35:40,330 --> 01:35:41,180
before.
You know,

2092
01:35:41,181 --> 01:35:44,510
the way he would approached comedy,
I think changed comedy.

2093
01:35:44,540 --> 01:35:46,380
Kennison changed a little bit.
No,

2094
01:35:46,420 --> 01:35:48,950
he certainly influenced a lot of people,
me included,

2095
01:35:49,370 --> 01:35:53,030
but prior just in my opinion,
he was like the number one

2096
01:35:53,080 --> 01:35:58,080
guy ever.
I called him a dirty cosby because 

2097
01:35:58,800 --> 01:36:02,190
remember we used to imitate Cosby,
cosby,

2098
01:36:02,470 --> 01:36:07,470
tell people spoke to them,
and then it's like if you listened to 

2099
01:36:07,470 --> 01:36:09,870
bill cosby to like,
I think himself,

2100
01:36:10,110 --> 01:36:14,480
Bill cosby himself,
like they update.

2101
01:36:14,640 --> 01:36:18,120
Those are the first two guys I 
reenlisted and then this is blasphemers.

2102
01:36:18,570 --> 01:36:23,570
Prior used to talk about Red Fox and how
it influenced them and I listened to 

2103
01:36:23,570 --> 01:36:23,570
read processes like,
Eh,

2104
01:36:23,570 --> 01:36:24,400
I just,
you know,

2105
01:36:24,401 --> 01:36:26,580
this is blasphemy,
but I didn't say it.

2106
01:36:27,380 --> 01:36:29,810
Well,
try going back and watching or listening

2107
01:36:29,811 --> 01:36:30,620
to lenny.
Bruce,

2108
01:36:31,340 --> 01:36:33,230
you won't last.
You won't laugh at all.

2109
01:36:33,550 --> 01:36:35,110
I believe you.
I don't even have to go back.

2110
01:36:35,111 --> 01:36:36,580
I believe it's the people

2111
01:36:36,990 --> 01:36:38,940
and I'm a huge Lenny Bruce family and 
you go with my house.

2112
01:36:38,941 --> 01:36:43,941
I have an old concert posters framed on 
my wall from when he was at the fillmore

2113
01:36:44,431 --> 01:36:45,480
in San Francisco.
I got it.

2114
01:36:45,780 --> 01:36:48,420
I recognize that without him,
I mean he's,

2115
01:36:48,500 --> 01:36:53,500
in my opinion,
he's the godfather of monitor standup 

2116
01:36:53,500 --> 01:36:53,500
comedy.
He's the first seed,

2117
01:36:53,500 --> 01:36:55,560
the real spark,
and then from him,

2118
01:36:55,950 --> 01:37:00,950
you know,
there's other guys in that era like the 

2119
01:37:00,950 --> 01:37:02,721
more sols and a lot of those other guys 
that just pointed out shit and saw 

2120
01:37:02,721 --> 01:37:06,801
things in a very intelligent way,
but then prior comes from that seed and 

2121
01:37:06,960 --> 01:37:10,050
prior takes it to the next day.
The differences prior.

2122
01:37:10,051 --> 01:37:15,051
Still funny.
You go back and watch Richard Pryor lot 

2123
01:37:15,051 --> 01:37:16,140
not live on the sunset strip.
That's a great one too,

2124
01:37:16,141 --> 01:37:18,480
but though even the one before that,
I forget what it's called.

2125
01:37:18,750 --> 01:37:22,110
The specialty did before that.
That's fucking fantastic.

2126
01:37:22,260 --> 01:37:27,260
It's great comedy.
I mean it's great observational comedy 

2127
01:37:27,260 --> 01:37:30,350
when he's doing the thing about the 
Italians they were digging to get.

2128
01:37:33,320 --> 01:37:34,320
It's funny,
man.

2129
01:37:34,321 --> 01:37:37,320
It's still,
it's still really good to this day.

2130
01:37:37,650 --> 01:37:42,420
Whereas like the Lenny Bruce stuff and 
in Red Fox to a certain extent,

2131
01:37:42,600 --> 01:37:43,770
but Red Fox,
I think,

2132
01:37:44,190 --> 01:37:49,190
you know,
I think it's just a different era when 

2133
01:37:49,190 --> 01:37:50,751
he was just saying dirty things like 
nobody had ever heard anybody do that 

2134
01:37:50,751 --> 01:37:51,270
before.
It was like God damn,

2135
01:37:51,271 --> 01:37:53,070
you know,
and also I think being there,

2136
01:37:53,370 --> 01:37:54,570
you know,
it's different,

2137
01:37:54,571 --> 01:37:56,160
different than then that word spreads

2138
01:37:56,570 --> 01:37:59,570
and you're listening to those people 
like God is going to be like,

2139
01:37:59,580 --> 01:38:01,230
there's one thing,
pride didn't want to have a specialist.

2140
01:38:01,231 --> 01:38:03,240
That was amazing to me.
Like he was killing,

2141
01:38:03,241 --> 01:38:06,240
he was up here just killing and then 
somebody said,

2142
01:38:06,300 --> 01:38:08,610
do mud bone,
and they begged him to do mud bone.

2143
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:11,730
But then I've never seen somebody like 
take it down.

2144
01:38:11,731 --> 01:38:16,731
It's like you're in a dance club and 
you're playing all this hard music and 

2145
01:38:16,731 --> 01:38:20,310
then we're going to play a slow takes 
place,

2146
01:38:20,311 --> 01:38:24,750
gets quiet.
And it's like everybody's splits still.

2147
01:38:24,780 --> 01:38:26,940
Everybody's paying as much attention as 
when he was.

2148
01:38:27,180 --> 01:38:31,410
He wasn't afraid to take it down and 
like that's ballsy.

2149
01:38:31,620 --> 01:38:33,600
And they bring them back up.
Just a master.

2150
01:38:33,930 --> 01:38:34,800
Yeah.
I mean he.

2151
01:38:34,820 --> 01:38:37,350
And by the way,
there was nobody like that before him.

2152
01:38:37,680 --> 01:38:40,140
He was the first guy that was really 
doing it like that.

2153
01:38:40,880 --> 01:38:45,880
He was the first guy that it was really 
just genuinely balls out funny all the 

2154
01:38:45,880 --> 01:38:50,330
time and had like these really 
heartwarming points,

2155
01:38:50,830 --> 01:38:53,990
you know,
when he came back from Africa and he had

2156
01:38:53,991 --> 01:38:58,991
those stories about meeting Africans and
that he was gonna stop saying the word 

2157
01:38:58,991 --> 01:39:01,520
nigger because of going to Africa.
Like you heard that you're like,

2158
01:39:01,521 --> 01:39:06,521
wow,
what comic has ever made you feel like 

2159
01:39:06,521 --> 01:39:06,521
that?

2160
01:39:06,521 --> 01:39:07,450
It was funny,
like I heard that when he said that,

2161
01:39:07,451 --> 01:39:08,150
and I said,
man,

2162
01:39:08,390 --> 01:39:13,390
I'm sorry.
That's a great point,

2163
01:39:14,681 --> 01:39:19,681
Richard.
You basically my comedy guy saying it's 

2164
01:39:20,620 --> 01:39:24,780
just too potent a word and only allowed 
to toss it around.

2165
01:39:24,860 --> 01:39:28,330
Can't stop it.
Stopped is what you started.

2166
01:39:28,390 --> 01:39:29,760
Well,
it's amazing that it's become a

2167
01:39:30,040 --> 01:39:35,040
and empowerment word.
It's like the word has gone from a word 

2168
01:39:35,040 --> 01:39:39,761
that's a slur to still being a slur,
but more often and empowerment and 

2169
01:39:40,221 --> 01:39:45,221
unlike a film familiarity word that 
black people are allowed to use amongst 

2170
01:39:45,221 --> 01:39:47,300
themselves and when you actually do try 
to,

2171
01:39:47,330 --> 01:39:51,320
like a white person does try to use it.
It's like almost legalized violence like

2172
01:39:51,321 --> 01:39:53,840
there will almost legally allowed to 
kick your ass.

2173
01:39:53,841 --> 01:39:58,841
So it's become a crazy thing.
It's not like it's never said what you 

2174
01:39:58,841 --> 01:39:59,270
say,
it'll make people devastated.

2175
01:39:59,271 --> 01:40:02,180
No black people say it all the time 
amongst themselves.

2176
01:40:02,430 --> 01:40:04,600
A very interesting sort of a dynamic.

2177
01:40:04,650 --> 01:40:06,740
But the daringness of it and the,
the,

2178
01:40:06,830 --> 01:40:11,830
the chance of saying it makes white 
people I know say it like hey,

2179
01:40:12,400 --> 01:40:17,400
like I was hanging out in this coffee 
shop who's eaten and one of the young 

2180
01:40:17,551 --> 01:40:18,480
comics,
he was like,

2181
01:40:18,690 --> 01:40:21,450
he started doing this,
this verse from this.

2182
01:40:21,460 --> 01:40:26,460
Right.
But he knows the word Niggas ain't 

2183
01:40:26,460 --> 01:40:26,460
right.
Right,

2184
01:40:26,460 --> 01:40:26,460
right,
right,

2185
01:40:26,460 --> 01:40:26,460
right.
And then he says it and it's like,

2186
01:40:26,460 --> 01:40:27,990
but I'm not going to react to that 
because you know why?

2187
01:40:28,020 --> 01:40:31,250
Because I'm over the word nigger.
This is nothing.

2188
01:40:31,650 --> 01:40:34,470
But there's a difference between that 
and him calling somebody.

2189
01:40:34,970 --> 01:40:35,500
Yeah.
But,

2190
01:40:35,800 --> 01:40:38,540
but there is a way they know they can't 
call,

2191
01:40:39,350 --> 01:40:40,730
you know,
they know I'm there.

2192
01:40:41,020 --> 01:40:42,830
You can't call somebody there.

2193
01:40:42,850 --> 01:40:47,850
So it's just saying it to get a rush 
themselves because now they're getting 

2194
01:40:47,850 --> 01:40:47,850
away with it

2195
01:40:47,850 --> 01:40:48,150
to get away with it.
Yeah.

2196
01:40:48,270 --> 01:40:52,440
And so I noticed that white guys do that
to try to get away with it in front of a

2197
01:40:52,500 --> 01:40:57,500
blackboard.
It's no fun if you say it in front of 

2198
01:40:57,500 --> 01:40:57,500
white people.
Right?

2199
01:40:57,500 --> 01:40:57,670
It's like,
if you can say it,

2200
01:40:57,910 --> 01:41:00,730
like somebody will repeat one of my 
jokes back to me.

2201
01:41:00,940 --> 01:41:02,260
Oh,
the n word.

2202
01:41:02,330 --> 01:41:07,330
And it's like,
it's like there's nothing you can do 

2203
01:41:07,330 --> 01:41:07,330
because it's your job.
You did say it.

2204
01:41:07,330 --> 01:41:08,460
What did you think about the controversy
with this?

2205
01:41:08,461 --> 01:41:09,720
Uh,
the,

2206
01:41:09,721 --> 01:41:10,890
uh,
the Django movie,

2207
01:41:11,490 --> 01:41:12,540
Django unchained,

2208
01:41:12,930 --> 01:41:14,150
I think it was a,
uh,

2209
01:41:14,280 --> 01:41:16,050
no controversy,
controversy.

2210
01:41:16,240 --> 01:41:21,020
Like I'm wondering if spike Lee is 
really just trying to help at the boy.

2211
01:41:21,050 --> 01:41:23,380
He's boys with terantin on the low and 
this,

2212
01:41:23,450 --> 01:41:25,710
this is his way to help him sell movies.

2213
01:41:26,420 --> 01:41:31,420
I don't think so.
I think he's a professional troll at 

2214
01:41:31,420 --> 01:41:32,150
this point.
I mean he supposed sued spike TV and one

2215
01:41:32,151 --> 01:41:33,650
a shitload of money.
I mean,

2216
01:41:33,651 --> 01:41:38,651
there's a lot of spike Jones,
there's a lot of spike Lee and none of 

2217
01:41:38,651 --> 01:41:38,651
them says,
yeah,

2218
01:41:38,651 --> 01:41:38,651
there's,
there's,

2219
01:41:38,651 --> 01:41:41,240
there's a lot of other spikes besides 
spike Lee.

2220
01:41:41,540 --> 01:41:43,520
I mean,
I would think it's got to be hundreds of

2221
01:41:43,521 --> 01:41:44,000
them.
Right?

2222
01:41:44,060 --> 01:41:47,900
How many different spikes are there in 
that famous football guys named spiker?

2223
01:41:48,340 --> 01:41:50,860
Does that dog from the fucking comic 
memory?

2224
01:41:51,020 --> 01:41:53,070
Let me go and spike,
but we go into bike chat APP.

2225
01:41:53,270 --> 01:41:55,730
Big Bull dog and the dog.
The dog's spike suit.

2226
01:41:55,731 --> 01:41:56,300
Spike Lee?

2227
01:41:56,460 --> 01:41:58,520
Yeah.
How fuck he should sue them.

2228
01:41:58,580 --> 01:42:03,580
I love fucking.
You say that you got out or rap on the 

2229
01:42:03,580 --> 01:42:03,580
name spike

2230
01:42:03,580 --> 01:42:03,660
now.
That to me is like,

2231
01:42:03,940 --> 01:42:06,950
like the Django Shit with Spike Lee.
That's him hating.

2232
01:42:07,340 --> 01:42:08,670
That's to me,
that's like,

2233
01:42:09,080 --> 01:42:10,940
you should have made this movie.
You didn't.

2234
01:42:11,700 --> 01:42:12,920
And this white guy made it.

2235
01:42:13,120 --> 01:42:14,140
Yeah.
He uh,

2236
01:42:14,170 --> 01:42:17,950
he fell apart artistically awhile ago.
Something happened in that guy.

2237
01:42:17,951 --> 01:42:19,360
He doesn't do the same shit that he used
to do.

2238
01:42:19,361 --> 01:42:20,740
If you go back to like do the right 
thing,

2239
01:42:20,741 --> 01:42:22,910
like his movies had this crackle to 
them.

2240
01:42:23,570 --> 01:42:24,980
Mo Betta Blues.
You know

2241
01:42:25,720 --> 01:42:27,730
what happened at her?
Oh my,

2242
01:42:27,760 --> 01:42:32,760
this,
this pen clicking the grades over there 

2243
01:42:32,760 --> 01:42:33,310
because it's hilarious.
I think spitely this is,

2244
01:42:33,340 --> 01:42:38,340
this is spike Lee's emo.
Make one really great movie and then 

2245
01:42:38,340 --> 01:42:40,340
make one really bad movie to the point 
like,

2246
01:42:40,550 --> 01:42:45,550
is this the same person?
Then he'll make another really good 

2247
01:42:45,550 --> 01:42:46,570
movie and then they'll make another like
you can name like,

2248
01:42:46,600 --> 01:42:47,500
like,
like,

2249
01:42:48,070 --> 01:42:50,050
like what was it?
She's got a,

2250
01:42:50,190 --> 01:42:52,870
there's a movie where she's got a habit 
and she's got a habit.

2251
01:42:52,871 --> 01:42:54,040
Then he made some movie where

2252
01:42:54,070 --> 01:42:59,070
you got to give it up to that movie 
because that movie made girls empowered 

2253
01:42:59,070 --> 01:43:00,370
to go get some deck.
Like it was okay to go get some Dick.

2254
01:43:00,400 --> 01:43:01,140
Like,
you know,

2255
01:43:01,190 --> 01:43:05,470
like he made a whole movie about a girl 
has got to get some tech and every,

2256
01:43:05,650 --> 01:43:06,550
all the other girls like,
wow,

2257
01:43:06,551 --> 01:43:11,551
I don't have to feel bad about having to
get some tech because this is like the 

2258
01:43:11,551 --> 01:43:13,120
lead of the movie.
Getting some data in that way.

2259
01:43:13,180 --> 01:43:16,650
I think he hooked a lot of dudes up and 
he probably got a lot of guys laid for

2260
01:43:16,650 --> 01:43:17,160
that.
Yeah.

2261
01:43:17,200 --> 01:43:18,640
Spike got two movies,
made,

2262
01:43:18,641 --> 01:43:23,641
two movies that's in my top 10 movies of
all time is Malcolm x and do the right 

2263
01:43:23,641 --> 01:43:27,691
thing.
And then he's got movies that are in my 

2264
01:43:27,691 --> 01:43:27,730
own words,
all time.

2265
01:43:27,731 --> 01:43:29,440
Worst movies.
Like what?

2266
01:43:29,860 --> 01:43:34,860
Uh,
forgot the name of his fucking movie 

2267
01:43:34,860 --> 01:43:37,831
man.
Something like girls six or girl 

2268
01:43:37,831 --> 01:43:40,631
something.
And you don't know what the fuck is 

2269
01:43:40,631 --> 01:43:41,050
going on.
Did you ever see the 25th hour?

2270
01:43:41,230 --> 01:43:42,800
Yeah,
the dude's pretty decent.

2271
01:43:43,180 --> 01:43:44,530
Okay.
It's pretty decent.

2272
01:43:44,650 --> 01:43:47,350
But it's hard to believe that again,
that that's the same dude.

2273
01:43:47,620 --> 01:43:50,040
That's the best to do the right thing 
guy.

2274
01:43:50,130 --> 01:43:55,130
Yeah.
I don't mind guys a switch up like an 

2275
01:43:55,130 --> 01:43:55,130
ugly girl.
Six.

2276
01:43:55,130 --> 01:43:55,460
You can't tell actually.
You can't tell.

2277
01:43:56,150 --> 01:43:59,170
Like if you put a bunch of movie posters
up on the wall,

2278
01:43:59,190 --> 01:44:02,030
he said which one did angalee direct?
You're like,

2279
01:44:02,810 --> 01:44:05,540
they're all different types of movies.
There's hulk,

2280
01:44:05,960 --> 01:44:07,490
there's a,
you know,

2281
01:44:07,540 --> 01:44:09,260
the,
the brokeback mountain.

2282
01:44:09,530 --> 01:44:12,130
And then there's the one that he just 
did and like,

2283
01:44:12,180 --> 01:44:14,360
they're all different styles.
So I don't mind that.

2284
01:44:14,420 --> 01:44:16,700
Is that like he made a movie about 
black,

2285
01:44:16,760 --> 01:44:21,760
like a black,
like the black soldiers in world war 

2286
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:22,790
two.
I think spike Lee,

2287
01:44:22,880 --> 01:44:24,290
this shit was horrendous.

2288
01:44:27,020 --> 01:44:28,850
I wanted to support the shit.
And I did.

2289
01:44:28,851 --> 01:44:30,980
I went to the movie theater,
but I was like,

2290
01:44:31,010 --> 01:44:32,390
really?
It wasn't that bad.

2291
01:44:32,420 --> 01:44:35,510
It may tell you something.
It was,

2292
01:44:35,600 --> 01:44:37,130
it was,
it was bad.

2293
01:44:38,140 --> 01:44:40,680
Bad Dialogue is works.
Yeah.

2294
01:44:41,430 --> 01:44:46,130
Have like flying the planes and the 
shooting at the train from the plains.

2295
01:44:46,160 --> 01:44:49,790
Well that was red tails.
Red Tails wasn't that great.

2296
01:44:49,820 --> 01:44:52,430
But he didn't make red tails.
That was George Lucas.

2297
01:44:52,820 --> 01:44:54,230
Okay.
So his was,

2298
01:44:54,560 --> 01:44:55,820
I forgot the name of this shit,

2299
01:44:56,950 --> 01:44:58,210
but it's,
it's forgettable.

2300
01:44:59,400 --> 01:45:01,390
And I went to the moon with it now,
so I was like,

2301
01:45:01,630 --> 01:45:06,630
what the fuck are you doing then?
And it's the same guy that made inside 

2302
01:45:06,630 --> 01:45:08,710
man an inside man.
It's pretty good movie.

2303
01:45:09,200 --> 01:45:10,700
Yeah.
It was pretty good movie.

2304
01:45:10,730 --> 01:45:12,080
That was good movie.
But it's like,

2305
01:45:12,230 --> 01:45:17,230
yeah,
that was actually one of his better 

2306
01:45:17,230 --> 01:45:17,230
ones,
but yeah,

2307
01:45:17,230 --> 01:45:17,600
this guy,
he's a bad motherfucker.

2308
01:45:17,660 --> 01:45:18,950
Yeah.
Life of Pi.

2309
01:45:18,980 --> 01:45:22,520
Which you didn't like the story.
I thought the store was ridiculous,

2310
01:45:22,640 --> 01:45:27,640
but it was so visually stunning and 
impressive that it mostly kept me 

2311
01:45:27,740 --> 01:45:32,740
occupied.
Especially when you consider the fact 

2312
01:45:32,740 --> 01:45:32,740
that wasn't even a real tiger like that.
Fuck.

2313
01:45:32,740 --> 01:45:34,370
It's like they're so close now,
man.

2314
01:45:34,430 --> 01:45:38,030
They're so close to looking like real 
animals.

2315
01:45:38,750 --> 01:45:42,440
If you go back just five or six years,
they couldn't do that.

2316
01:45:42,550 --> 01:45:44,390
They like,
we always talk about that movie.

2317
01:45:44,391 --> 01:45:47,180
I am legend.
There's a scene where the lion takes out

2318
01:45:47,181 --> 01:45:50,960
the deer and Manhattan Line looks fake.
It looks so fake,

2319
01:45:51,410 --> 01:45:54,710
but this tiger looks way real.
And it was in some things.

2320
01:45:55,040 --> 01:45:57,170
Yeah,
the whole movie and you know,

2321
01:45:57,340 --> 01:46:01,270
the uh,
the visual aspect of the scenery and the

2322
01:46:01,660 --> 01:46:06,660
shots that he had.
I mean it was just a brilliantly film 

2323
01:46:06,660 --> 01:46:10,161
moved to the point where a stupid plot 
like didn't stop me from enjoying the 

2324
01:46:10,161 --> 01:46:11,400
movie because it was so good because I,

2325
01:46:11,710 --> 01:46:14,140
it's really when I go to a movie for the
visuals.

2326
01:46:14,250 --> 01:46:16,090
Yeah.
And that's exactly what I went for.

2327
01:46:16,091 --> 01:46:17,860
I wasn't really counting on the story 
either.

2328
01:46:18,140 --> 01:46:19,970
Yeah.
I went for the visuals.

2329
01:46:20,060 --> 01:46:21,530
It was stunning,
you know,

2330
01:46:21,560 --> 01:46:23,900
it was like brokeback mountain had a lot
of visuals too,

2331
01:46:23,901 --> 01:46:26,510
and the guy spits in his hand and fix it
on that dude up.

2332
01:46:26,660 --> 01:46:31,660
Now Watch this cock right in one stroke 
type of visual.

2333
01:46:32,500 --> 01:46:35,600
That was a visual like and he knew what 
he was doing when he showed the guide.

2334
01:46:35,990 --> 01:46:40,730
You showed the guy spitting on his hand 
and stuffing in that guy's ass for you.

2335
01:46:40,880 --> 01:46:45,880
Just look the idea,
the idea that you get so horny that 

2336
01:46:46,551 --> 01:46:48,930
you'd be willing to let a dude fuck you 
because you're out on the,

2337
01:46:48,980 --> 01:46:50,040
on a,
you know,

2338
01:46:50,040 --> 01:46:53,160
a cow train for a couple of weeks.
That's a little silly.

2339
01:46:53,600 --> 01:46:55,310
Okay,
so leap.

2340
01:46:55,420 --> 01:47:00,420
There's a gay dude there and there's a 
dude who's Goldbelt fucking got talked 

2341
01:47:00,420 --> 01:47:01,890
into letting the gay dude fuck them.
That's what happened.

2342
01:47:01,891 --> 01:47:02,130
Now,

2343
01:47:02,630 --> 01:47:07,630
did she ever hear that video or audio of
Obama has a book called hope and he did 

2344
01:47:08,281 --> 01:47:10,430
it,
the audio book of it and they ruined and

2345
01:47:10,431 --> 01:47:12,920
they.
Somebody took all the cuss words and put

2346
01:47:12,921 --> 01:47:15,560
it like edited together and like a quick
little audio clip.

2347
01:47:15,780 --> 01:47:18,420
It's so trippy to lists he has cuss 
words.

2348
01:47:18,460 --> 01:47:19,460
Oh yeah.
And his new book.

2349
01:47:19,490 --> 01:47:20,060
Yeah.
Check this out.

2350
01:47:20,070 --> 01:47:21,890
This new book,
hope is.

2351
01:47:21,960 --> 01:47:23,390
When did this come out?
I don't know.

2352
01:47:23,460 --> 01:47:24,480
And this customer.
Yeah,

2353
01:47:24,760 --> 01:47:29,760
exactly.
There the white folks and then they're 

2354
01:47:29,760 --> 01:47:29,760
ignorant.
Motherfuckers like you now you know that

2355
01:47:29,760 --> 01:47:30,770
guy in shit.
Sorry,

2356
01:47:30,900 --> 01:47:32,580
motherfucker got nothing on me,
right?

2357
01:47:32,820 --> 01:47:34,560
Nothing.
What am I bitch Nigga.

2358
01:47:34,760 --> 01:47:38,460
By your own damn price.
You said it's way too complicated for me

2359
01:47:40,050 --> 01:47:41,400
man.
That's Morgan Friedman.

2360
01:47:42,840 --> 01:47:47,100
Lockhart crush a lot of white people's 
confidence in him.

2361
01:47:48,200 --> 01:47:49,680
That's uh,
that's interesting.

2362
01:47:49,740 --> 01:47:54,740
That's interesting that he would do a 
book while he's president where he 

2363
01:47:54,740 --> 01:47:57,831
swears on it and then do the audio 
version of it when he smokes weed and 

2364
01:47:57,831 --> 01:48:00,170
plays basketball.
His first book had crosswords,

2365
01:48:00,180 --> 01:48:01,860
right?
Was that his first book had cost?

2366
01:48:02,170 --> 01:48:04,170
I don't know if it's from his book.
Hope so.

2367
01:48:04,171 --> 01:48:09,171
I'm not sure when that came out,
but the version of the hulk was pretty 

2368
01:48:09,171 --> 01:48:09,171
fucking good,
man.

2369
01:48:09,300 --> 01:48:14,300
That guy,
he did a good job that Eric Bana sucks 

2370
01:48:14,300 --> 01:48:14,430
the fat one solar in that movie.

2371
01:48:14,670 --> 01:48:17,640
That was a movie I went to see when I 
was high and I was acting.

2372
01:48:18,240 --> 01:48:20,860
This is terrible acting because acting 
was bad.

2373
01:48:21,480 --> 01:48:24,360
Phoning it in when you're high,
that's when you can really tell.

2374
01:48:24,480 --> 01:48:26,550
And by the way that Eric Bana Guy's a 
bad motherfucker.

2375
01:48:26,910 --> 01:48:29,520
Who's great in that movie chopper.
You ever see that movie chopper?

2376
01:48:29,521 --> 01:48:34,521
Nah,
but I seen him at other shit where he 

2377
01:48:34,521 --> 01:48:34,521
was good,
but in the hall I'm like,

2378
01:48:34,521 --> 01:48:34,770
Son,
get out of here.

2379
01:48:34,771 --> 01:48:38,510
You are not acting like you're about to 
fucking green dots.

2380
01:48:38,560 --> 01:48:39,810
It's fake.
It's stupid.

2381
01:48:40,140 --> 01:48:43,440
But the new dude who's the new dude that
played the hulk and the x man.

2382
01:48:43,880 --> 01:48:46,930
Fuck you mean adventure the avengers.
What's that?

2383
01:48:47,490 --> 01:48:49,710
Mark ruffled.
That guy's the best.

2384
01:48:49,800 --> 01:48:54,150
He's the best banner they've ever had.
Whether it's David or bruce,

2385
01:48:54,151 --> 01:48:57,030
whichever one you want to call.
His name was bruce in the comic book,

2386
01:48:57,031 --> 01:48:59,550
but David on television because they 
thought Bruce was too gay.

2387
01:48:59,650 --> 01:49:00,210
Oh,
for real?

2388
01:49:00,300 --> 01:49:01,830
Yeah.
They changed it for the TV show.

2389
01:49:01,831 --> 01:49:03,420
The Hawk was different than the comic 
book.

2390
01:49:04,590 --> 01:49:06,840
Everybody was like,
why isn't he bruce banner now?

2391
01:49:06,841 --> 01:49:09,150
He's David Banner.
Different guy.

2392
01:49:09,180 --> 01:49:14,180
He's a guy that the guys unassuming and 
that's part of my gruffalo.

2393
01:49:14,700 --> 01:49:16,490
You really believe that he could be a 
scientist to.

2394
01:49:17,040 --> 01:49:18,240
Whereas Eric bounty like,
listen,

2395
01:49:18,250 --> 01:49:19,980
bitch,
stop it.

2396
01:49:20,370 --> 01:49:25,370
Stop it.
You are not a fucking nuclear 

2397
01:49:25,370 --> 01:49:25,830
scientists.
I just saw you in a.

2398
01:49:26,040 --> 01:49:30,380
What was the name of that movie with 
Brad Pitt and I believe you.

2399
01:49:30,410 --> 01:49:32,280
You're a scientist.
The fuck out of here.

2400
01:49:32,440 --> 01:49:34,680
What?
What's his face was pretty decent in it.

2401
01:49:34,740 --> 01:49:37,770
What's the little dude's name that was 
in American history x.

2402
01:49:38,460 --> 01:49:39,620
The other guy that played the whole 
call?

2403
01:49:39,660 --> 01:49:40,400
Norton.
Yeah,

2404
01:49:40,401 --> 01:49:42,330
at Norton.
He's a great actor,

2405
01:49:42,390 --> 01:49:45,450
but even in him he just wasn't as good 
as that guy that ruffle a guy.

2406
01:49:45,451 --> 01:49:47,750
You really believe it when he was about 
to into the hulk

2407
01:49:48,520 --> 01:49:50,350
is a clear separation.
Yeah.

2408
01:49:50,351 --> 01:49:52,780
But he's got a certain kind of crazy to 
him.

2409
01:49:52,940 --> 01:49:54,910
Yeah.
And it has a certain amount of like,

2410
01:49:54,911 --> 01:49:57,460
you know,
like I don't know what it is,

2411
01:49:57,461 --> 01:50:00,280
where you,
you accept a guy in a part of what it is

2412
01:50:00,281 --> 01:50:02,620
when you don't,
when you're not willing to go with it.

2413
01:50:02,890 --> 01:50:07,890
Some people have this overwhelming type 
of performance ability that just makes 

2414
01:50:08,051 --> 01:50:08,560
you,
like,

2415
01:50:08,830 --> 01:50:10,930
you just get sucked into it and you 
enjoy it.

2416
01:50:11,290 --> 01:50:14,020
And there's other people that sort of 
Nicholas cage it where you're like,

2417
01:50:14,021 --> 01:50:16,720
all right,
just saying the dialogue and moving,

2418
01:50:17,120 --> 01:50:22,120
you know,
not that Nicholas Cage is capable of 

2419
01:50:22,120 --> 01:50:24,211
great performances,
but there's been a few nicholas cage 

2420
01:50:24,211 --> 01:50:24,610
movies where you're like,
this fucking ghost rider.

2421
01:50:24,611 --> 01:50:26,760
This dude does not believe he's the 
ghost rider.

2422
01:50:26,761 --> 01:50:28,600
All right.
This is just for taxes.

2423
01:50:28,640 --> 01:50:29,110
Yeah.
You,

2424
01:50:29,220 --> 01:50:31,510
you owe some money that government.
I totally understand.

2425
01:50:31,520 --> 01:50:33,340
And I'm not shitting on you man.
I'm just saying.

2426
01:50:34,270 --> 01:50:38,000
But there's something dudes that just,
they just lock into a role and you know,

2427
01:50:38,001 --> 01:50:42,610
like fuck God.
Damn it was that one dude.

2428
01:50:42,611 --> 01:50:46,210
He was in do the right thing.
He looks like a Spanish dude.

2429
01:50:46,450 --> 01:50:49,360
Tell him I said John called Esposito.
Yes,

2430
01:50:50,170 --> 01:50:52,230
yes,
yes.

2431
01:50:52,350 --> 01:50:53,070
Oh,
funny.

2432
01:50:53,520 --> 01:50:55,120
Always liked him.
Yeah.

2433
01:50:55,180 --> 01:50:56,560
And he ended up,
you know,

2434
01:50:56,561 --> 01:51:00,390
you're sitting here man.
That guy can act as fucking ass off that

2435
01:51:00,410 --> 01:51:01,260
I can act it

2436
01:51:01,410 --> 01:51:03,420
fucking ass off.
Wasn't he in Mo?

2437
01:51:03,421 --> 01:51:06,120
Better Blues too?
Wasn't he like part of the band?

2438
01:51:06,121 --> 01:51:09,540
They didn't get along so well.
I think he was in school days.

2439
01:51:10,050 --> 01:51:11,940
I think it was in a bunch of spike Lee 
joints,

2440
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:15,720
but he's one of those dudes that like 
when when you see him in a role,

2441
01:51:15,840 --> 01:51:18,690
like he can lock onto that fucking 
thing,

2442
01:51:18,840 --> 01:51:23,840
he can lock on to you believe you 
believe he really is pussy whipped to 

2443
01:51:23,840 --> 01:51:23,840
really believe it.
You know,

2444
01:51:23,840 --> 01:51:26,400
some guys can do that.
Denzel Washington obviously can do that.

2445
01:51:26,430 --> 01:51:28,950
He can do that in any role and whatever 
it is you,

2446
01:51:29,020 --> 01:51:32,610
you buy him.
But some dudes you just like,

2447
01:51:32,640 --> 01:51:36,680
this motherfucker's playing a vampire or
this motherfucker's plan.

2448
01:51:37,830 --> 01:51:42,830
It's fucked up because sometimes it's so
disappointing because you've seen them 

2449
01:51:42,830 --> 01:51:42,830
in one movie.
Yeah.

2450
01:51:42,830 --> 01:51:42,830
Great.
And then this one is like,

2451
01:51:42,840 --> 01:51:43,950
man,
I could do that shit.

2452
01:51:44,250 --> 01:51:44,910
Yeah,

2453
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:50,000
that's sad.
When you see like Deniro late the later 

2454
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:53,391
movies,
like the recent movies and we've seen 

2455
01:51:53,391 --> 01:51:53,391
any of the recent movies.
Uh,

2456
01:51:53,391 --> 01:51:56,550
I try not to just fucking phoning it in.
It's Robert in the Arrow and he's 

2457
01:51:56,550 --> 01:51:58,050
fucking phone and then you're like,
wow,

2458
01:51:58,290 --> 01:52:01,500
this is the man from fucking raging 
bull.

2459
01:52:01,890 --> 01:52:06,090
If you go back to raging bull and see 
what a bad mother fucker,

2460
01:52:06,091 --> 01:52:08,790
Robert Deniro was,
you think about like Cape Fear,

2461
01:52:08,791 --> 01:52:13,090
how bad ass he was.
It is like enough done.

2462
01:52:13,240 --> 01:52:14,850
I'm done.
Give me the check.

2463
01:52:14,851 --> 01:52:15,630
I'm done.

2464
01:52:16,360 --> 01:52:17,140
Done.
Very.

2465
01:52:17,330 --> 01:52:19,720
They say about Al Pachino.
He just yells.

2466
01:52:19,930 --> 01:52:21,820
Yeah,
he's like a bad actor.

2467
01:52:22,980 --> 01:52:24,480
Yeah.
He's not the same anymore.

2468
01:52:24,481 --> 01:52:25,710
I mean,
you go back to like dog day,

2469
01:52:25,711 --> 01:52:26,580
afternoon,
man.

2470
01:52:27,090 --> 01:52:28,530
Shit.
Yeah.

2471
01:52:28,531 --> 01:52:30,450
He had already lost it by the time he 
started.

2472
01:52:30,451 --> 01:52:32,070
Who?
While in a woman.

2473
01:52:32,071 --> 01:52:34,950
That was a great movie.
Jesus Christ.

2474
01:52:34,951 --> 01:52:36,620
It's okay.
Like they just gave that to him.

2475
01:52:36,980 --> 01:52:37,480
Yeah.
Yeah.

2476
01:52:37,530 --> 01:52:42,530
Go back to dog day afternoon and you see
him and his fucking boyfriend who are 

2477
01:52:43,741 --> 01:52:46,370
robbing a bank to pay for sex change 
operation.

2478
01:52:46,371 --> 01:52:51,371
I mean,
that is a fucking mean and he's so good 

2479
01:52:51,831 --> 01:52:53,840
in that movie.
He's so good.

2480
01:52:53,930 --> 01:52:55,670
He's so good in so many movies,
man.

2481
01:52:55,671 --> 01:52:57,860
It's scarface.
Are you fucking kidding me?

2482
01:52:58,070 --> 01:53:00,650
The guy that was in scarface.
I mean,

2483
01:53:00,651 --> 01:53:05,651
think about how good he was in that 
fucking movie and to go from that to 

2484
01:53:05,651 --> 01:53:06,710
what you're seeing now.
Come on.

2485
01:53:06,760 --> 01:53:11,760
It's like it's a shame.
It's almost always just talk about 

2486
01:53:11,760 --> 01:53:12,260
comedy and just saw that guy on TV.

2487
01:53:12,850 --> 01:53:17,850
Tell them this is rolling the balls.
See how you were talking about shot 

2488
01:53:17,850 --> 01:53:17,850
fighters.
Fighters.

2489
01:53:18,050 --> 01:53:19,510
Sad,
sad,

2490
01:53:19,840 --> 01:53:24,840
sad.
Especially when you see Mick Jagger 

2491
01:53:24,840 --> 01:53:27,111
still slinging Dick like 76 back.
He's out there fucking strutton and 

2492
01:53:29,211 --> 01:53:34,211
sweating and shit.
That guy with his heart will explode 

2493
01:53:34,211 --> 01:53:35,030
onstage one day.
Be Perfect.

2494
01:53:35,390 --> 01:53:37,350
Perfect way to go out as the best way to
go out.

2495
01:53:37,450 --> 01:53:41,480
He's he's performing like I've seen some
of his videos of jagger performing.

2496
01:53:42,470 --> 01:53:47,470
He looks like.
I mean if you're not looking at the 

2497
01:53:47,470 --> 01:53:47,660
lines on his face,
if you look at the way he moves around,

2498
01:53:47,690 --> 01:53:49,790
it looks like a guy that's 30,
40 years younger than him.

2499
01:53:49,800 --> 01:53:54,800
He's right there.
I mean because he knows he's 70 mixed 

2500
01:53:54,951 --> 01:53:56,450
emotions.
That mixed emotion song.

2501
01:53:56,480 --> 01:54:01,480
I saw a video of him singing it and 
dancing it and he's fucking dance 

2502
01:54:01,480 --> 01:54:04,721
around.
He's doing all that crazy shit that he 

2503
01:54:04,721 --> 01:54:04,721
used to do as he moves.

2504
01:54:04,721 --> 01:54:08,350
Good for like an old dude because I 
think Mick Jagger's got to be fucking 65

2505
01:54:08,781 --> 01:54:10,640
years old or something.
Now he's up there,

2506
01:54:10,641 --> 01:54:11,690
man.
How old is he?

2507
01:54:11,691 --> 01:54:13,070
Brian?
You Know Mick Jagger?

2508
01:54:13,540 --> 01:54:14,570
If you get.
Let's get.

2509
01:54:14,571 --> 01:54:15,310
We'll google it.
Bullets.

2510
01:54:15,320 --> 01:54:17,030
Gas.
I say 65 years old.

2511
01:54:17,031 --> 01:54:19,880
What he say?
Seventy two 72 77.

2512
01:54:21,200 --> 01:54:26,200
Seven 77 77 $77 too high.
Yeah,

2513
01:54:27,371 --> 01:54:30,310
that's right.
I'm doing 72 72.

2514
01:54:30,380 --> 01:54:32,540
Oh Wow.
I say 65,

2515
01:54:32,570 --> 01:54:33,310
right?
That's what I signed.

2516
01:54:34,980 --> 01:54:36,240
What do we got here?
What are we going?

2517
01:54:36,290 --> 01:54:37,850
Come on mic.
Oh Mick,

2518
01:54:37,851 --> 01:54:41,290
how old are you?
Might 69.

2519
01:54:41,840 --> 01:54:46,580
God Damn Son.
Jesus fucking Christ.

2520
01:54:46,640 --> 01:54:51,640
He's almost 70 years old.
So I think you're the closest now 

2521
01:54:51,640 --> 01:54:51,640
because he's at work and you went over 
it.

2522
01:54:51,730 --> 01:54:53,240
What did you get to 72.
Oh,

2523
01:54:53,241 --> 01:54:55,730
72.
My father died when he was 69.

2524
01:54:56,010 --> 01:54:59,870
Oh my God.
And Mick Jagger is impregnating on stage

2525
01:55:00,110 --> 01:55:03,050
and he's still like Finn and fairly 
healthy.

2526
01:55:03,920 --> 01:55:06,830
God Damn it.
Sixty nine years old.

2527
01:55:06,831 --> 01:55:10,610
That makes me feel good because that new
song that they have,

2528
01:55:10,611 --> 01:55:13,220
I was kind of joking around about like 
they never come out with new material,

2529
01:55:13,980 --> 01:55:15,230
new songs.
Pretty fucking good.

2530
01:55:15,260 --> 01:55:16,460
Oh that's good.
That's not bad.

2531
01:55:16,540 --> 01:55:18,290
Just turn into Jerry Seinfeld right 
there.

2532
01:55:20,660 --> 01:55:25,660
Why would you say that to do with Brian 
would ever disagree with me like that.

2533
01:55:29,250 --> 01:55:31,130
That's one of the beautiful things about
being a comic.

2534
01:55:31,131 --> 01:55:36,131
Like when you start out like I got to 
see Seinfeld on a weekend at governance 

2535
01:55:36,131 --> 01:55:39,920
and I got to see like on the weekends,
like I would go my home club.

2536
01:55:39,921 --> 01:55:41,870
We'll let you go and see.
The headline is,

2537
01:55:41,930 --> 01:55:45,240
who's the most impressive guy that you 
saw in your open mic days?

2538
01:55:45,241 --> 01:55:46,680
Did you like when you're open,
like days,

2539
01:55:46,681 --> 01:55:49,970
do you ever paid to see some money and 
get rocked a?

2540
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:51,450
We,
they will let us come see,

2541
01:55:51,510 --> 01:55:54,480
see them all.
So seinfeld.

2542
01:55:54,510 --> 01:55:56,880
I didn't believe in Seinfeld until I saw
him that weekend.

2543
01:55:57,660 --> 01:55:58,750
He didn't believe in them.
No,

2544
01:55:58,751 --> 01:56:03,180
I didn't because you saw like the 
evening at the Improv sets and then he,

2545
01:56:03,200 --> 01:56:06,270
I saw him coming rock for an hour and 
then I was like,

2546
01:56:06,540 --> 01:56:08,340
the five minutes I'm doing that I 
killed,

2547
01:56:10,210 --> 01:56:15,210
Hae,
just killed harder for an hour.

2548
01:56:16,260 --> 01:56:21,260
And like my five minutes ain't shit.
Five minutes wasn't as good as his intro

2549
01:56:22,770 --> 01:56:25,830
was when he said Hi.
And then he just rocked for an hour like

2550
01:56:25,831 --> 01:56:26,730
that.
And I was like,

2551
01:56:26,790 --> 01:56:31,790
yeah,
it's inspiring to want to throw your 

2552
01:56:31,790 --> 01:56:33,891
shit out,
but you want to tell you shit out every 

2553
01:56:33,891 --> 01:56:33,891
time you see somebody.
Good.

2554
01:56:33,891 --> 01:56:36,850
Yeah.
But you really should throw that shit 

2555
01:56:36,850 --> 01:56:36,850
out,
you know,

2556
01:56:36,850 --> 01:56:36,850
really,
like you're not a bad thing.

2557
01:56:36,850 --> 01:56:37,010
Yeah,
you're,

2558
01:56:37,011 --> 01:56:42,011
you're,
what you're doing is you're sort of 

2559
01:56:42,011 --> 01:56:43,880
getting a picture,
a greater picture of like where you 

2560
01:56:43,880 --> 01:56:44,340
stand in the world of comedy really 
beginning.

2561
01:56:44,341 --> 01:56:46,530
You fucking suck.
You think you're good because you got an

2562
01:56:46,531 --> 01:56:48,630
ego,
but you put me fucking suck.

2563
01:56:48,840 --> 01:56:50,430
So you need to see a guy like I saw 
Richard,

2564
01:56:50,431 --> 01:56:52,110
Jenny man and I,
uh,

2565
01:56:52,230 --> 01:56:55,290
I paid the Sim because I wasn't in catch
a rising star.

2566
01:56:55,291 --> 01:56:57,510
Catch a rising star,
the guy who ran it was a dick.

2567
01:56:58,110 --> 01:56:59,760
Oh,
you're such an asshole.

2568
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:03,240
And he wouldn't let me work there.
So I paid you.

2569
01:57:03,241 --> 01:57:07,760
Paid the same like night to my open mic 
time to see a jenny during the week,

2570
01:57:07,761 --> 01:57:09,750
night,
fucking destroyed man.

2571
01:57:10,080 --> 01:57:15,080
He killed and he killed so effortlessly 
and he did like an hour and a half on 

2572
01:57:15,080 --> 01:57:17,730
stage and he just kept going and kept 
going and kept calling and finally looks

2573
01:57:17,731 --> 01:57:20,070
over his watching her show was supposed 
to be over about an hour ago.

2574
01:57:20,071 --> 01:57:20,550
So,
uh,

2575
01:57:21,150 --> 01:57:22,640
I guess I should enzyme,
but uh,

2576
01:57:22,650 --> 01:57:23,910
I got nothing better to do it,
so fuck it.

2577
01:57:23,940 --> 01:57:26,370
So he just keeps going.
It didn't like another 15 minutes and he

2578
01:57:26,371 --> 01:57:28,350
had more material that he did.
Um,

2579
01:57:28,650 --> 01:57:30,480
east side comedy club.
Remember that place?

2580
01:57:31,380 --> 01:57:33,630
They said that he was there for two 
nights,

2581
01:57:33,660 --> 01:57:38,660
two shows a night and he did a different
hour every show and crushed and crushed.

2582
01:57:38,761 --> 01:57:40,740
And by the way,
it was constantly writing.

2583
01:57:40,800 --> 01:57:45,800
You get off the stage,
fucking write down on a Napkin back of 

2584
01:57:45,800 --> 01:57:45,800
this hotel.
I mean,

2585
01:57:45,800 --> 01:57:47,040
it was constantly coming up with new 
material.

2586
01:57:47,130 --> 01:57:49,320
That dude was a man.
He's one of my favorite comics ever.

2587
01:57:49,440 --> 01:57:54,440
People don't realize how good he was.
I saw that guy at the comedy works in 

2588
01:57:54,440 --> 01:57:56,240
Montreal and um,
that,

2589
01:57:56,241 --> 01:57:57,390
you know,
you ever do that place?

2590
01:57:57,480 --> 01:57:58,680
Yeah.
The room upstairs,

2591
01:57:58,681 --> 01:58:00,390
Jemma was place.
Oh,

2592
01:58:00,391 --> 01:58:02,940
that place is magic.
It's like another one,

2593
01:58:02,941 --> 01:58:05,940
like the Boston comedy club seats 100 
people at the most.

2594
01:58:05,941 --> 01:58:09,070
I'm going to be there in March.
I'm doing the club in March with fear.

2595
01:58:09,130 --> 01:58:09,580
Oh,
you are?

2596
01:58:09,720 --> 01:58:10,110
Yeah.
Yeah.

2597
01:58:10,111 --> 01:58:11,130
Yeah.
Because last time I did it,

2598
01:58:11,131 --> 01:58:13,410
I did it a few months ago.
I did a big theater in Montreal.

2599
01:58:13,720 --> 01:58:18,720
I'm like,
I don't wanna like go to a theater and 

2600
01:58:18,720 --> 01:58:18,720
then go to another theater like four 
months later.

2601
01:58:18,720 --> 01:58:18,720
That seems rude.

2602
01:58:19,650 --> 01:58:22,400
Asking people to come see you again 
later.

2603
01:58:22,590 --> 01:58:25,110
I do.
So I am working on some new shit anyway.

2604
01:58:25,111 --> 01:58:27,690
So I liked,
I liked doing like little clubs you want

2605
01:58:27,691 --> 01:58:29,060
to go?
Yeah.

2606
01:58:29,350 --> 01:58:32,090
Well I'll bring it up to a um,
the other one in Vancouver,

2607
01:58:32,100 --> 01:58:33,720
Vancouver's going to be crazy.
We're working on that.

2608
01:58:34,080 --> 01:58:37,820
But uh,
what was my point once they saw Jenny at

2609
01:58:37,830 --> 01:58:39,630
the car,
I saw him up there in the,

2610
01:58:39,631 --> 01:58:44,631
uh,
the comedy works and it was during the 

2611
01:58:44,631 --> 01:58:47,071
festival and a bunch of us went upstairs
just to see his set because we wanted 

2612
01:58:47,071 --> 01:58:50,940
to,
like we heard Jenny was going on at 

2613
01:58:50,940 --> 01:58:52,291
10:00
and went up there to CSI and he fucking 

2614
01:58:52,291 --> 01:58:54,100
destroyed with he talk about anything he
was talking about buying a car.

2615
01:58:54,340 --> 01:58:56,510
He's talking about going to a car dealer
and you know,

2616
01:58:56,590 --> 01:58:59,050
the guy offered him a bunch of shit that
he didn't ask for,

2617
01:58:59,790 --> 01:59:01,070
you know,
like,

2618
01:59:01,260 --> 01:59:04,510
but I didn't want that and that's why I 
didn't like we'd come up with a bunch of

2619
01:59:04,511 --> 01:59:07,330
funny shit that he would say to the guy 
and this and that.

2620
01:59:07,330 --> 01:59:10,440
And Are you the guy that does.
And we were dying,

2621
01:59:10,480 --> 01:59:15,480
dying.
And I remember thinking I had never 

2622
01:59:15,480 --> 01:59:16,360
heard any of these bits before.
He's fucking killing.

2623
01:59:16,570 --> 01:59:18,340
And He,
in my opinion,

2624
01:59:18,341 --> 01:59:22,410
didn't get the respect that he deserved.
He wanted to be like a movement stopping

2625
01:59:22,480 --> 01:59:27,480
that bugged them,
fucked them like crazy because being on 

2626
01:59:27,480 --> 01:59:29,320
the road apparently he would get like 
real snotty with people on the road,

2627
01:59:29,560 --> 01:59:33,340
like you would work in clubs.
And I think with a lot of guys,

2628
01:59:33,370 --> 01:59:38,370
it's a prestige thing.
They don't feel respected if they have 

2629
01:59:38,370 --> 01:59:41,821
to do the road.
Like he said something once I remember 

2630
01:59:41,821 --> 01:59:41,821
this goes up.
I knew how much,

2631
01:59:41,821 --> 01:59:41,821
uh,
uh,

2632
01:59:41,821 --> 01:59:42,940
I was going to do the road.
I wouldn't be living in La.

2633
01:59:42,941 --> 01:59:44,620
I moved to La because I thought I was 
going to do TV.

2634
01:59:44,650 --> 01:59:46,780
Like you were saying that it was like,
do you know that you're Richard?

2635
01:59:46,780 --> 01:59:49,480
Jenny,
do you understand that most comics,

2636
01:59:49,481 --> 01:59:51,270
like they'll step back and go,
like,

2637
01:59:51,280 --> 01:59:54,220
there's a master that's master guy just 
walked in.

2638
01:59:54,340 --> 01:59:59,340
The guy that's about to go on stage,
watch what he does because that is a 

2639
01:59:59,340 --> 02:00:00,760
master at crafting and delivering comedy
material.

2640
02:00:00,900 --> 02:00:02,440
He was over being Richard Jeni.
He's,

2641
02:00:02,441 --> 02:00:07,441
yeah.
He's like looking at Seinfeld and all 

2642
02:00:07,441 --> 02:00:07,630
his peers and their success and it's 
like,

2643
02:00:07,840 --> 02:00:09,770
it's tough to look and see how it's 
problem.

2644
02:00:10,240 --> 02:00:15,240
You really are.
That's it will eat away at you because 

2645
02:00:15,240 --> 02:00:16,000
like you said,
like a different hour every night at the

2646
02:00:16,001 --> 02:00:19,750
east side comedy club and he did a lot 
of specials.

2647
02:00:19,900 --> 02:00:24,900
Yeah.
And it just didn't get to where he felt 

2648
02:00:24,900 --> 02:00:24,900
he could have.
Yeah,

2649
02:00:24,900 --> 02:00:25,510
I guess so man.
I don't know.

2650
02:00:25,511 --> 02:00:28,090
I think that his,
in his mind,

2651
02:00:28,091 --> 02:00:29,980
if you want to do in movies,
have,

2652
02:00:29,981 --> 02:00:32,620
you weren't doing a big hit series.

2653
02:00:32,620 --> 02:00:34,600
You were a failure,
you know,

2654
02:00:34,630 --> 02:00:36,010
for,
for whatever reason.

2655
02:00:36,040 --> 02:00:41,040
That's how he looked at it.
And when he was 49 it was when he 

2656
02:00:41,040 --> 02:00:44,370
committed suicide.
I guess he just got to that point where 

2657
02:00:44,370 --> 02:00:44,890
it was like,
you know,

2658
02:00:44,891 --> 02:00:47,200
he just couldn't imagine it getting any 
better.

2659
02:00:47,230 --> 02:00:52,230
He's not going to become a movie star at
50 and just couldn't fucking take it 

2660
02:00:52,230 --> 02:00:54,670
anymore.
But as a comic man mean he was a fuck is

2661
02:00:54,680 --> 02:00:59,680
wrong.
It's just one of the best I've ever 

2662
02:00:59,680 --> 02:00:59,680
seen.
Who's a great comment.

2663
02:00:59,680 --> 02:00:59,680
The good thing is I met him before he 
died.

2664
02:00:59,890 --> 02:01:04,890
He,
he was coming to the laugh factory and 

2665
02:01:04,890 --> 02:01:07,561
he is friends with Jamie said,
I got to say hi like a few times.

2666
02:01:08,500 --> 02:01:12,010
No long conversations really,
but I didn't tell him how.

2667
02:01:12,730 --> 02:01:14,950
I ain't going to have to tell them how 
funny the fuck he was.

2668
02:01:15,550 --> 02:01:17,620
It was a very,
very funny comic man.

2669
02:01:18,190 --> 02:01:19,140
He,
uh,

2670
02:01:19,760 --> 02:01:22,120
I ran into him a couple of weeks before 
he died.

2671
02:01:22,121 --> 02:01:24,190
We were on a plane together going to 
Austin,

2672
02:01:24,220 --> 02:01:29,220
just just randomly.
He was sitting in front of me and I was 

2673
02:01:29,220 --> 02:01:29,220
like,
hey man,

2674
02:01:29,220 --> 02:01:29,220
what's going on?
What are you doing?

2675
02:01:29,220 --> 02:01:29,680
I'm going to do a private gig.
What are you doing?

2676
02:01:29,681 --> 02:01:34,681
I'm going to do cap city.
He was doing a corporate gig or 

2677
02:01:34,681 --> 02:01:34,681
something like that.
You've seen.

2678
02:01:34,681 --> 02:01:36,940
Does it seem exuberant?
But it seemed like normal.

2679
02:01:36,941 --> 02:01:37,440
Richard.
Jenny.

2680
02:01:37,450 --> 02:01:39,980
He was always friendly to me.
I had heard weird things about

2681
02:01:39,980 --> 02:01:41,240
them,
but to me he was always friendly.

2682
02:01:41,241 --> 02:01:45,530
But he did five comedy specials.
Tan from.

2683
02:01:45,590 --> 02:01:47,900
Yeah,
from 92 to 2005.

2684
02:01:47,901 --> 02:01:51,650
He did five of them.
He did to showtime specials.

2685
02:01:51,651 --> 02:01:53,990
Crazy from the heat and boy from New 
York City.

2686
02:01:54,150 --> 02:01:56,840
The boy from New York City,
it was probably the best one.

2687
02:01:57,260 --> 02:01:59,450
That was the first one.
That was the first one that came out.

2688
02:01:59,451 --> 02:02:02,540
He came out guns blazing in 1990.
That was a.

2689
02:02:02,541 --> 02:02:05,600
That was a fucking killer special.
I remember.

2690
02:02:05,601 --> 02:02:08,300
I can always tell by friends who aren't 
Comedians,

2691
02:02:08,301 --> 02:02:12,710
how they react and my friend guy who 
used to own executive billiards in white

2692
02:02:12,711 --> 02:02:13,460
plains,
New York,

2693
02:02:13,461 --> 02:02:17,090
he's just fucking fabulous guy.
His name is guy as a reading,

2694
02:02:17,270 --> 02:02:19,310
but he was a piano player so he changed 
his name.

2695
02:02:19,311 --> 02:02:24,311
That Guy Hamilton,
because people get nervous with that 

2696
02:02:24,311 --> 02:02:26,630
Kenny shit or if they don't want to hire
a guy as a to come over your house.

2697
02:02:26,810 --> 02:02:29,330
They up because he was like,
he had like nice watches.

2698
02:02:29,331 --> 02:02:31,650
He always had like a nice ring and nice 
clothes on.

2699
02:02:32,870 --> 02:02:33,830
I might trust.
Okay.

2700
02:02:33,831 --> 02:02:36,710
And everything's Nice.
So he comes into the pool hall.

2701
02:02:36,711 --> 02:02:39,080
He goes,
I saw this fucking guy.

2702
02:02:39,450 --> 02:02:40,700
He goes,
Richard Jenny's,

2703
02:02:40,701 --> 02:02:43,880
he's the funniest guy on earth.
He must be the funniest guy on earth.

2704
02:02:44,180 --> 02:02:45,440
And I was like,
he's probably one of them,

2705
02:02:45,441 --> 02:02:46,370
man.
He's right up there.

2706
02:02:46,371 --> 02:02:50,480
And he was just about this boy from New 
York City special.

2707
02:02:50,481 --> 02:02:51,050
That was like,
yeah,

2708
02:02:51,051 --> 02:02:52,760
like 1990,
1991.

2709
02:02:52,880 --> 02:02:55,790
And then he did three hbo specials on 
top of that.

2710
02:02:56,390 --> 02:03:01,390
He did a platypus man in [inaudible] 92.
So he did two comedy specials in 92.

2711
02:03:03,020 --> 02:03:05,540
That's how gangster.
Is that the same year?

2712
02:03:05,630 --> 02:03:07,160
Yes,
he did two.

2713
02:03:07,161 --> 02:03:08,240
He did.
Platypus.

2714
02:03:08,241 --> 02:03:10,340
Man.
And he did crazy from the heat,

2715
02:03:10,370 --> 02:03:15,370
both of them in [inaudible] 92.
Then he did a good Catholic boy in 

2716
02:03:15,370 --> 02:03:18,620
[inaudible] 97 and a big steaming pile 
of me in 2005,

2717
02:03:18,830 --> 02:03:21,770
which is still good.
It was still even that.

2718
02:03:21,771 --> 02:03:23,480
But he went on.
That was a long stretch.

2719
02:03:23,481 --> 02:03:26,920
He went eight years without a,
without doing a special

2720
02:03:26,980 --> 02:03:29,470
thinking about try to copy those and 
check them out again.

2721
02:03:29,650 --> 02:03:34,650
I just remember like the bit when he's 
talking about a football referee,

2722
02:03:36,130 --> 02:03:40,350
like during the call and then it was,
you know,

2723
02:03:40,510 --> 02:03:42,320
player offside,
blah blah blah blah.

2724
02:03:42,380 --> 02:03:45,410
Then he started getting personal and 
then last week,

2725
02:03:46,950 --> 02:03:51,950
I can't remember who said it,
but he ended up like laying on the 

2726
02:03:51,950 --> 02:03:54,631
stage,
like having a casual conversation with 

2727
02:03:54,631 --> 02:03:57,001
them at a stadium full of people.
And this is the balls at him to just lay

2728
02:03:57,101 --> 02:03:59,390
on stage and take that joke as far as 
ticket.

2729
02:04:00,010 --> 02:04:04,150
That shit was like he would,
he would take shit like really far.

2730
02:04:04,151 --> 02:04:05,370
That was one of the things I learned 
from him.

2731
02:04:05,371 --> 02:04:06,550
That's one of the things I learned from 
him.

2732
02:04:06,551 --> 02:04:06,820
Yeah.

2733
02:04:07,020 --> 02:04:08,550
I learned that from him because he 
would,

2734
02:04:08,850 --> 02:04:11,850
he would go like my jokes at the time 
were like,

2735
02:04:11,851 --> 02:04:13,170
really?
You like rudimentary.

2736
02:04:13,200 --> 02:04:13,910
They were like,
look,

2737
02:04:14,030 --> 02:04:16,260
a little clunky wheels that I'd made out
of like,

2738
02:04:16,430 --> 02:04:18,120
you know,
out of a piece of wood.

2739
02:04:18,390 --> 02:04:22,140
They were one very sophisticated and 
that I would watch him and I would watch

2740
02:04:22,141 --> 02:04:27,141
how he would take a subject and explore 
every possible angle.

2741
02:04:28,231 --> 02:04:30,870
And when he did that,
it made it so much funnier.

2742
02:04:30,900 --> 02:04:32,090
Right.
And then I realized like,

2743
02:04:32,130 --> 02:04:33,140
Oh,
I'm not doing that.

2744
02:04:33,141 --> 02:04:35,340
Like I'm not exploring things far 
enough.

2745
02:04:35,400 --> 02:04:37,860
And now to this day when I watch a on 
stage

2746
02:04:38,040 --> 02:04:40,490
and he keeps going with a bit,
I enjoy it more.

2747
02:04:40,610 --> 02:04:45,150
Like when you were doing a bit the other
day that I was dying laughing on man.

2748
02:04:45,360 --> 02:04:50,360
The difference between how many white 
bankers rob people and how many black 

2749
02:04:51,331 --> 02:04:53,240
dudes with hoodies and the black dude 
with hoodies,

2750
02:04:53,290 --> 02:04:55,680
Robert things because he's got to pay 
the white bag or like damn,

2751
02:04:55,740 --> 02:05:00,210
I got to play these bags and you take 
it,

2752
02:05:00,520 --> 02:05:02,010
you know,
you take it really far,

2753
02:05:02,011 --> 02:05:07,011
you keep going and going and going and 
going with it and as it goes on and on 

2754
02:05:07,011 --> 02:05:08,700
and on it becomes funnier.
And as a,

2755
02:05:08,760 --> 02:05:10,980
as a comic,
like I know that already,

2756
02:05:11,070 --> 02:05:13,790
you know,
like sort of as a way of operating,

2757
02:05:14,220 --> 02:05:16,050
but to see it,
I like to see it

2758
02:05:16,070 --> 02:05:18,500
sometimes we forget what we know.
Yeah.

2759
02:05:18,530 --> 02:05:23,530
And then like,
like somebody told me that about me and 

2760
02:05:23,530 --> 02:05:23,600
I was like,
Oh shit,

2761
02:05:23,601 --> 02:05:28,060
I do do that because sometimes you 
forget what,

2762
02:05:28,340 --> 02:05:32,510
what makes you operate.
Like I remember being a comic,

2763
02:05:32,610 --> 02:05:37,610
like an early comic and then pipe man,
I need more topics so I can have more 

2764
02:05:37,611 --> 02:05:42,050
jokes and then it hit me later on.
I don't need more topics.

2765
02:05:42,350 --> 02:05:46,430
I just need to explore the topics that I
have more.

2766
02:05:46,540 --> 02:05:49,820
Yeah.
It's not about how many topics I have,

2767
02:05:50,200 --> 02:05:53,990
it's how many like how much I can milk 
something.

2768
02:05:54,080 --> 02:05:55,280
Yeah.
And it,

2769
02:05:55,290 --> 02:05:57,920
it becomes better,
it comes better and then,

2770
02:05:57,921 --> 02:06:02,921
you know,
once you have the crowd rolling out a 

2771
02:06:02,921 --> 02:06:03,080
joke and you keep hitting them,
you don't have to set anything up.

2772
02:06:03,081 --> 02:06:08,081
Everything is a joke.
It's like it's almost like a boxing 

2773
02:06:08,081 --> 02:06:08,081
match.
Your work in the volume work in the body

2774
02:06:08,081 --> 02:06:09,440
and they're bending over and now I can 
hit them in the head.

2775
02:06:10,180 --> 02:06:10,940
You can knock them out

2776
02:06:11,210 --> 02:06:15,480
and then sometimes you milk it too much 
and you've got to back off that shit.

2777
02:06:15,590 --> 02:06:16,680
Like sometimes you're like,
alright,

2778
02:06:16,750 --> 02:06:17,170
gotta change.

2779
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:18,680
You learn.
You know,

2780
02:06:19,410 --> 02:06:21,720
sometimes somebody has the whisper 
something into a tape recorder.

2781
02:06:25,170 --> 02:06:27,250
Fuck.
But sometimes you,

2782
02:06:27,251 --> 02:06:27,940
uh,
you know,

2783
02:06:27,941 --> 02:06:31,490
that's the only way to come up with new 
angles to explore.

2784
02:06:31,700 --> 02:06:36,700
Like that's one of the cool things about
doing a small club is that you can fuck 

2785
02:06:36,700 --> 02:06:40,591
around Brown and a small club way better
than you can in a giant theater when 

2786
02:06:40,591 --> 02:06:41,740
you're in a giant theater.
Like for the most part you kind of doing

2787
02:06:41,741 --> 02:06:43,810
a show like I'll fuck around a little 
bit,

2788
02:06:44,260 --> 02:06:46,480
but for the most part you're doing a 
show you give,

2789
02:06:46,520 --> 02:06:48,370
you give the people what they paid for.
Yeah.

2790
02:06:48,371 --> 02:06:50,530
But I still let leave room to fuck 
around.

2791
02:06:50,531 --> 02:06:51,000
Right.
You have to.

2792
02:06:51,310 --> 02:06:52,410
And when I did my,
uh,

2793
02:06:52,420 --> 02:06:57,420
the end of the world show at the wiltern
and down was like a big show for me 

2794
02:06:57,420 --> 02:06:58,750
because it was like,
it was a honey honey the band,

2795
02:06:58,810 --> 02:07:00,370
which I think are great.
The,

2796
02:07:00,371 --> 02:07:02,590
they're good friends,
they'd be on the podcast many times.

2797
02:07:02,590 --> 02:07:07,590
They did like 20 minutes and then Joey 
Diaz does like close to a half an hour I

2798
02:07:08,171 --> 02:07:13,171
guess.
And then Stan hope does close to an 

2799
02:07:13,171 --> 02:07:13,171
hour.
He did 15 minutes,

2800
02:07:13,171 --> 02:07:14,860
so the whole show's like an hour and you
know,

2801
02:07:14,890 --> 02:07:19,890
30,
40 minutes long before I even get up on 

2802
02:07:19,890 --> 02:07:19,890
stage.
Yeah.

2803
02:07:19,890 --> 02:07:23,070
But they were so good that right away,
like the crowd was so good that right 

2804
02:07:23,070 --> 02:07:25,180
away I was fucking around and I came up 
with a whole new bit,

2805
02:07:25,210 --> 02:07:29,050
like onstage in the moment,
just riffed a whole new bit.

2806
02:07:29,290 --> 02:07:34,290
And then I remember like I got to get 
home and listen to that one because 

2807
02:07:34,290 --> 02:07:34,600
there was a lot like that was a lot of 
shit.

2808
02:07:34,601 --> 02:07:36,490
I just thought of,
you know,

2809
02:07:36,491 --> 02:07:41,491
because when you're doing a bit and it's
killing sometimes you'll just think on 

2810
02:07:41,491 --> 02:07:41,491
the spot.
Oh yeah.

2811
02:07:41,491 --> 02:07:42,630
And then you could,
why wouldn't you just do that?

2812
02:07:42,630 --> 02:07:44,260
Yeah.
And then just go with it.

2813
02:07:44,770 --> 02:07:46,740
But sometimes it doesn't work.
Sometimes you,

2814
02:07:46,760 --> 02:07:49,030
like,
you come up with a new thing for a bit.

2815
02:07:49,031 --> 02:07:54,031
You've been doing for a minute.
You know what took me so long to think 

2816
02:07:54,031 --> 02:07:54,031
of this shit.
Like,

2817
02:07:54,031 --> 02:07:54,550
alright,
how stupid am I?

2818
02:07:54,570 --> 02:07:56,470
I didn't see that in front of my 
friends.

2819
02:07:58,090 --> 02:08:03,090
And then the worst is when you record a 
bit and then after it's done on a CD or 

2820
02:08:03,090 --> 02:08:04,780
a special,
you have a new tagline for it,

2821
02:08:04,781 --> 02:08:06,790
you know,
it's too late.

2822
02:08:08,440 --> 02:08:13,440
That's Hedberg actually did a joke on 
two separate cds and he goes,

2823
02:08:14,150 --> 02:08:14,200
yeah,

2824
02:08:14,290 --> 02:08:19,290
this joke is on my first album,
but I added something to tell you like 

2825
02:08:21,100 --> 02:08:24,370
what party added.
I'm paraphrasing,

2826
02:08:24,371 --> 02:08:25,200
I don't remember how you signed up,

2827
02:08:25,220 --> 02:08:30,220
but he's one of my favorites ever to 
listen to like in the car cause and 

2828
02:08:30,490 --> 02:08:33,110
squeaky clean.
Hedberg squeaky clean.

2829
02:08:33,111 --> 02:08:34,370
You could play it in front of your 
mother.

2830
02:08:34,670 --> 02:08:38,330
Like he might say what the fuck man.
He might say that every now and again,

2831
02:08:38,331 --> 02:08:42,110
like very rarely,
but like the content of his material was

2832
02:08:42,111 --> 02:08:44,720
just observational humor that was just 
ridiculous.

2833
02:08:44,721 --> 02:08:46,970
You know,
he would make you stoned.

2834
02:08:47,150 --> 02:08:49,910
You would feel stone.
Listen to Mitch Hedberg,

2835
02:08:49,940 --> 02:08:51,840
you know,
jazz comedy and Shit.

2836
02:08:51,910 --> 02:08:56,910
Yeah.
Somebody asked me if I wanted a frozen 

2837
02:08:56,910 --> 02:08:56,910
banana.
I said no,

2838
02:08:56,910 --> 02:08:59,360
but I want a regular banana later.
So yeah.

2839
02:08:59,400 --> 02:09:04,400
Yes.
So stupid.

2840
02:09:06,450 --> 02:09:09,270
If you saw that written down on paper,
it's like,

2841
02:09:09,480 --> 02:09:10,170
that seems like,

2842
02:09:10,290 --> 02:09:12,600
like a line that would be in a 
children's book,

2843
02:09:12,870 --> 02:09:14,100
you know,
it sounds Dr.

2844
02:09:14,230 --> 02:09:19,020
Seuss's,
but coming out of him it was hilarious.

2845
02:09:19,590 --> 02:09:24,590
He just,
he was just such a fun guy to listen to 

2846
02:09:24,590 --> 02:09:26,190
this and then that's a perfect example 
of like comedy,

2847
02:09:26,191 --> 02:09:31,191
like being like something dudes have a 
style and it don't make any sense that 

2848
02:09:31,191 --> 02:09:32,790
you couldn't do it and I couldn't do it 
that way,

2849
02:09:32,791 --> 02:09:34,260
but for him,
Bam.

2850
02:09:34,261 --> 02:09:35,100
That's it.
Shit.

2851
02:09:35,130 --> 02:09:37,680
He knows he knocks out of the park with 
that style.

2852
02:09:38,250 --> 02:09:43,250
It's weird.
That's comedy is the only art form I 

2853
02:09:43,250 --> 02:09:45,300
think where you really making your own 
instrument,

2854
02:09:45,690 --> 02:09:46,530
you know,
you're like,

2855
02:09:46,740 --> 02:09:49,110
you're like everybody who plays the 
guitar,

2856
02:09:49,220 --> 02:09:51,840
you're playing a guitar.
I guess if you're singing,

2857
02:09:52,050 --> 02:09:54,810
you make your own different kinds of 
noises with your mouth.

2858
02:09:55,320 --> 02:10:00,320
But the styles of comedy very so fucking
wildly like when you're trying to piece 

2859
02:10:00,481 --> 02:10:00,980
it together.

2860
02:10:01,030 --> 02:10:06,030
So much uncertainty in the beginning.
So it makes me mad when people aren't 

2861
02:10:06,241 --> 02:10:09,010
trying to make their own instruments and
you're listening to me like what?

2862
02:10:09,510 --> 02:10:11,850
You're wasting this opportunity.
Yeah.

2863
02:10:11,851 --> 02:10:16,851
Well there's a lot of uh,
imitation in the beginning and then you 

2864
02:10:16,851 --> 02:10:20,460
really,
I found myself imitating Richard Jenny 

2865
02:10:20,460 --> 02:10:21,840
once I was on stage.
It was probably like a year in two,

2866
02:10:21,841 --> 02:10:26,841
maybe two.
I was still living in Boston and I was 

2867
02:10:26,841 --> 02:10:26,940
like doing a bit and I was doing a bit 
the way I thought,

2868
02:10:26,941 --> 02:10:29,420
like Richard Tray would do a bit like,
as I was saying it,

2869
02:10:29,421 --> 02:10:30,980
I was realizing I was like,
oh,

2870
02:10:30,981 --> 02:10:35,981
it's so gross.
Like I knew I was influenced by him 

2871
02:10:35,981 --> 02:10:35,981
because I was like,
I would see him and I go,

2872
02:10:35,981 --> 02:10:40,810
man.
I was like figuring out how to be funny 

2873
02:10:40,810 --> 02:10:42,701
like that.
But to actually like here you imitate 

2874
02:10:42,701 --> 02:10:45,060
them coming out of your mouth.
Some people get like super sensitive

2875
02:10:45,100 --> 02:10:49,810
about that shit.
I was talking to somebody last night and

2876
02:10:49,811 --> 02:10:54,811
uh,
I think like there's one female con is 

2877
02:10:54,811 --> 02:10:58,841
this female comics.
She sounds like Sarah Silverman and I 

2878
02:10:59,351 --> 02:11:03,040
think Sarah Silverman stitches.
She was like,

2879
02:11:03,041 --> 02:11:08,041
man,
I don't see with ms dot always kinda 

2880
02:11:08,041 --> 02:11:09,610
cold with me.
And in my mind I'm like best because you

2881
02:11:09,611 --> 02:11:11,050
sound like Sarah Silverman.

2882
02:11:13,340 --> 02:11:17,930
This is a chick that sounds exactly like
a felicia Michael's.

2883
02:11:18,380 --> 02:11:21,510
I mean I don't know who she is,
but he wasn't Felicia Michael's.

2884
02:11:21,540 --> 02:11:22,710
And I was like,
wow,

2885
02:11:22,860 --> 02:11:25,170
that's not felicia Michael's.
That's crazy.

2886
02:11:25,380 --> 02:11:28,470
Like the sound of the voice,
the delivery,

2887
02:11:28,471 --> 02:11:30,930
the pacing.
It was like she was a big Felicia.

2888
02:11:30,970 --> 02:11:35,970
Michael's checked or Swagger Jack.
Jack the Art Kalitta and shit.

2889
02:11:38,220 --> 02:11:38,920
Does Kelly,

2890
02:11:39,210 --> 02:11:42,950
Jeff,
they say he took a joe style.

2891
02:11:43,400 --> 02:11:45,030
Oh yeah.
Really?

2892
02:11:45,140 --> 02:11:47,410
Yeah.
Did he piss on girls too?

2893
02:11:47,860 --> 02:11:49,580
Nah,
he added that.

2894
02:11:50,030 --> 02:11:50,690
That was.
Well,

2895
02:11:50,691 --> 02:11:52,160
you know,
he added his own thing.

2896
02:11:52,420 --> 02:11:53,770
So twists,
take,

2897
02:11:54,110 --> 02:11:55,700
take all the game.
Yeah.

2898
02:11:55,701 --> 02:12:00,701
They are Kelly videos of him pissing on 
that girl or like how did that guy get 

2899
02:12:00,701 --> 02:12:01,970
off?
And it didn't.

2900
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:05,030
It didn't even put a scratch in his 
career.

2901
02:12:05,480 --> 02:12:08,360
He came back stronger than ever.
Black people lie to me.

2902
02:12:08,390 --> 02:12:10,550
I'll tell you,
that was going on.

2903
02:12:10,760 --> 02:12:11,450
First of all,
you know,

2904
02:12:11,451 --> 02:12:16,451
the funny thing is I went to a viewing 
party where a friend called a bunch of 

2905
02:12:17,901 --> 02:12:22,901
black friends over and we watched the 
video with his wife and we had food and 

2906
02:12:23,391 --> 02:12:24,280
we watched the,
the,

2907
02:12:24,370 --> 02:12:25,150
the,
the art.

2908
02:12:25,300 --> 02:12:26,820
Kelly secretary.
Kelly sex tape.

2909
02:12:27,170 --> 02:12:29,420
What kind of funny it was just,
it was just,

2910
02:12:29,580 --> 02:12:31,410
you know,
they're all comic mind.

2911
02:12:31,410 --> 02:12:36,410
So it was fun,
but then everybody that I met that was 

2912
02:12:36,410 --> 02:12:36,410
black,
they was like,

2913
02:12:36,410 --> 02:12:38,390
we done with him with done with him in a
fucking,

2914
02:12:38,510 --> 02:12:39,650
you can't build,
you can't do that.

2915
02:12:39,950 --> 02:12:43,100
Then.
Then the album after that,

2916
02:12:43,130 --> 02:12:46,010
the chocolate factory,
because number one,

2917
02:12:46,200 --> 02:12:48,890
it doesn't even with no radio play.
And I'm like,

2918
02:12:49,190 --> 02:12:50,810
I thought y'all said we was done with 
him.

2919
02:12:50,950 --> 02:12:52,310
I was,
I was with y'all.

2920
02:12:53,110 --> 02:12:54,200
Nah,
we ain't done.

2921
02:12:54,740 --> 02:12:59,740
What is it about him that he's got such 
teflon skin when it comes to 

2922
02:12:59,740 --> 02:13:01,820
controversy,
that shit is unexplainable to me,

2923
02:13:01,940 --> 02:13:04,370
but I'm not mad at it.
He seems so confident.

2924
02:13:05,330 --> 02:13:07,620
No matter what happens.
He seems like,

2925
02:13:07,770 --> 02:13:10,940
like no problems but just going to get 
through this.

2926
02:13:10,970 --> 02:13:12,930
He's got a me.
I didn't get on that girl.

2927
02:13:12,931 --> 02:13:13,640
I was like,
what?

2928
02:13:14,360 --> 02:13:19,360
Like that real talk song.
I know you've seen that song when you 

2929
02:13:19,360 --> 02:13:19,360
watch that Bill Thompson.
Yeah.

2930
02:13:19,360 --> 02:13:23,921
When he,
when he's in the nice talking to the 

2931
02:13:23,921 --> 02:13:23,921
beginning,
you know,

2932
02:13:23,921 --> 02:13:24,440
got,
got was stoic.

2933
02:13:24,450 --> 02:13:25,790
He's about to jump off.
You're like,

2934
02:13:25,791 --> 02:13:30,791
this is not a smart guy,
but this guy has figured out a way to 

2935
02:13:30,791 --> 02:13:32,010
carve a career through the some of the 
craziest

2936
02:13:32,010 --> 02:13:34,290
controversy ever,
but as that humbled him.

2937
02:13:34,380 --> 02:13:39,380
No Bitch,
I wish you would burn my mother fucking 

2938
02:13:39,380 --> 02:13:39,380
clothes.
I mean,

2939
02:13:39,400 --> 02:13:41,160
Shit.
He says we'll talk.

2940
02:13:41,540 --> 02:13:43,980
I mean,
he's not backing off of this at all.

2941
02:13:44,440 --> 02:13:49,440
Like I like,
I just don't have an issue with Lindsay 

2942
02:13:49,440 --> 02:13:49,440
Lohan.
Right?

2943
02:13:49,440 --> 02:13:51,360
Like all this shit,
all the shit that she gets into.

2944
02:13:51,620 --> 02:13:52,860
Then I realized,
listen,

2945
02:13:53,400 --> 02:13:56,070
if I was her and I could get away with 
all that shit,

2946
02:13:56,370 --> 02:14:00,360
why would I stop?
I think it's for her though.

2947
02:14:00,810 --> 02:14:04,650
I mean there's new outlet.
Like people are saying online that she's

2948
02:14:04,651 --> 02:14:07,830
like a high price hooker now and that's 
what they're saying on websites.

2949
02:14:07,831 --> 02:14:12,831
Like this guy paid her like $100,000
to spend the night with him and I know 

2950
02:14:13,240 --> 02:14:15,150
celebrity girls that do that though.
Yeah,

2951
02:14:15,850 --> 02:14:16,280
yeah,
yeah.

2952
02:14:16,530 --> 02:14:17,540
You know,
they tell you.

2953
02:14:18,380 --> 02:14:19,340
No.
I know.

2954
02:14:19,410 --> 02:14:24,410
I got a friend who works for a really 
rich dude and if he wants to fuck a 

2955
02:14:27,511 --> 02:14:30,240
celebrity,
it's almost like a.

2956
02:14:30,770 --> 02:14:32,880
You know how Jenny was doing that 
corporate show?

2957
02:14:33,710 --> 02:14:36,900
It's just like that.
We'll fly you into the island.

2958
02:14:36,930 --> 02:14:40,140
How many celebrities do this?
Quite a few.

2959
02:14:40,200 --> 02:14:43,120
I think really more than you think,
man.

2960
02:14:43,121 --> 02:14:45,180
I really like,
like what level?

2961
02:14:45,190 --> 02:14:50,190
Celebrity.
They do a Steven Seagal movie and you 

2962
02:14:50,190 --> 02:14:51,150
know,
it doesn't look to be in the sequel from

2963
02:14:51,151 --> 02:14:52,530
there,
up from there,

2964
02:14:52,590 --> 02:14:54,170
up from there,
up here,

2965
02:14:54,230 --> 02:14:55,950
from there up.
So how does it work?

2966
02:14:55,951 --> 02:14:58,530
Like the guy like watches TV,
like calling us bitch.

2967
02:14:58,560 --> 02:14:59,410
Yeah.
Basically.

2968
02:15:00,440 --> 02:15:05,440
Yeah.
And how much does he offered them a 

2969
02:15:05,440 --> 02:15:05,440
figure.
But you sorta.

2970
02:15:05,440 --> 02:15:07,460
You're sorta bar at movie.
I did not see the boy.

2971
02:15:08,330 --> 02:15:10,050
Boy,
they didn't see Bruno.

2972
02:15:10,590 --> 02:15:12,680
Bruno.
What's the dictator?

2973
02:15:12,690 --> 02:15:15,060
A dictator.
Dictatorship.

2974
02:15:15,450 --> 02:15:16,770
Like who do you have?
Megan?

2975
02:15:16,800 --> 02:15:19,350
Megan Fox,
Megan Fox.

2976
02:15:19,920 --> 02:15:24,010
And he pays her and she leaves and he 
takes a photo with her,

2977
02:15:24,070 --> 02:15:29,070
puts on the wall in the camera,
pulls out and it's all celebrity 

2978
02:15:29,070 --> 02:15:29,070
pitches.

2979
02:15:29,070 --> 02:15:31,470
So it's like he's done this with every 
stolid.

2980
02:15:32,370 --> 02:15:37,370
There's some shit that happens up there.
How does a fucking agent even call you 

2981
02:15:37,370 --> 02:15:42,241
with that?
Say if you are Megan Fox and let's just 

2982
02:15:42,241 --> 02:15:43,170
go with Megan Fox because she was an 
example using that movie.

2983
02:15:43,530 --> 02:15:47,130
If that's real,
how does that even get to you?

2984
02:15:47,160 --> 02:15:52,160
How does that get to your desk?
How does that offer you know how it 

2985
02:15:52,160 --> 02:15:54,270
might get to you from another famous 
celebrity chick who already did it?

2986
02:15:54,300 --> 02:15:55,760
Who already did it?
So listen girl,

2987
02:15:55,780 --> 02:15:58,680
I think she's.
Because what I did this weekend,

2988
02:15:59,470 --> 02:16:01,350
transformer two's didn't pay that much 
money,

2989
02:16:01,470 --> 02:16:04,920
but look at your car,
which you should see my house.

2990
02:16:05,810 --> 02:16:08,890
Fuck this dude for 50 minutes.
How did you get $50?

2991
02:16:08,891 --> 02:16:10,920
Million.
50 million to a trillionaire.

2992
02:16:10,930 --> 02:16:13,710
Ain't nothing that didn't make sense.
A couple of weeks.

2993
02:16:13,980 --> 02:16:18,980
He paid a couple of weeks.
Our to Megan Fox in the ass especially 

2994
02:16:18,980 --> 02:16:22,251
goes asked her mouth.
I'm not going to just clean her out and 

2995
02:16:22,251 --> 02:16:26,671
just put her mouth is cleaner out.
I mean look 50 million to to assault 

2996
02:16:27,901 --> 02:16:29,040
number ny.
I.

2997
02:16:29,230 --> 02:16:30,120
That ain't shit.
It's

2998
02:16:30,230 --> 02:16:31,480
nothing.
I bet it really.

2999
02:16:31,540 --> 02:16:36,540
I mean,
it's probably doesn't spend it that 

3000
02:16:36,540 --> 02:16:38,010
often,
but you remember when that thing broke 

3001
02:16:38,010 --> 02:16:40,830
where there was a girl,
I think she was a penthouse pet or 

3002
02:16:40,830 --> 02:16:43,741
something along those lines.
She was writing a story about her time 

3003
02:16:43,781 --> 02:16:48,781
with the sultan of Brunei.
She was ratting out all the other girls 

3004
02:16:48,781 --> 02:16:48,781
and there was all these different girls 
were like.

3005
02:16:48,781 --> 02:16:52,770
Some of them were models,
some of them were porn stars and he 

3006
02:16:52,770 --> 02:16:52,770
would just decide I want that one,
that one,

3007
02:16:52,770 --> 02:16:55,000
that one,
and he liked the agency would bring them

3008
02:16:55,060 --> 02:16:58,690
all the girls to him and he would pay 
them extravagant amounts of money,

3009
02:16:58,720 --> 02:17:03,720
like hundreds of thousands of dollars.
He'd give them jewelry like really like 

3010
02:17:03,720 --> 02:17:07,030
insane amounts of money in in jewelry,
like hundreds of thousands of dollars in

3011
02:17:07,031 --> 02:17:11,740
gold and diamonds and shit like that and
he just would keep a giant private Harem

3012
02:17:11,741 --> 02:17:13,750
and you keep them there for a few months
or six months,

3013
02:17:13,751 --> 02:17:18,751
whatever the fuck it is and these girls 
would go back to la and just live like 

3014
02:17:18,751 --> 02:17:22,940
ball players.
Now all of a sudden that this chick has 

3015
02:17:22,940 --> 02:17:25,560
400 grand in the bank or something crazy
like that and so they had to like lie 

3016
02:17:25,560 --> 02:17:25,560
about what they were doing.
Oh,

3017
02:17:25,560 --> 02:17:30,181
we were modeling in Bahrain.
Meanwhile they just couldn't fucking 

3018
02:17:30,181 --> 02:17:31,240
trains right on them by the salt and all
his boys.

3019
02:17:31,530 --> 02:17:33,820
The sultan parties and shit like that.
Yeah.

3020
02:17:33,821 --> 02:17:37,810
They say he has a.
He has like a whole disco in his house,

3021
02:17:37,811 --> 02:17:42,811
like a giant lavishly appointed club and
he hires all these girls.

3022
02:17:44,850 --> 02:17:47,430
Happens all the time.
I hear it all the time from the girls.

3023
02:17:47,431 --> 02:17:50,010
So I got offered again to do it.
I'm not doing that shit.

3024
02:17:52,110 --> 02:17:55,010
How much is you offer them A.
I don't know.

3025
02:17:55,040 --> 02:17:57,140
I didn't really get into the same guy.
Or is it different guys?

3026
02:17:57,170 --> 02:18:02,170
I think it's different guys,
but there's like all these different 

3027
02:18:02,170 --> 02:18:02,170
deals were like,
I hear all the time.

3028
02:18:02,170 --> 02:18:03,170
People are like,
I can't get offered,

3029
02:18:03,200 --> 02:18:06,530
but I'm not done do that.
The guys are not a bad guy.

3030
02:18:06,770 --> 02:18:11,770
You know?
He seems like a nice guy and you 

3031
02:18:11,770 --> 02:18:11,770
wouldn't mind fucking them for 
$50,000,000.

3032
02:18:11,770 --> 02:18:12,710
It's not gonna.
You're not gonna beat me,

3033
02:18:13,400 --> 02:18:16,640
I don't think it's 50 million I think 
made a $10,000

3034
02:18:16,700 --> 02:18:21,700
range,
but can you imagine seeing like the 

3035
02:18:21,700 --> 02:18:23,590
black book of like somebody like the 
president of paramount or whatever and 

3036
02:18:23,590 --> 02:18:25,880
like seeing like what the celebrities 
are for sure.

3037
02:18:25,881 --> 02:18:30,881
That,
that are also like would like Taylor 

3038
02:18:30,881 --> 02:18:30,890
swift one,
but she has conditions.

3039
02:18:30,891 --> 02:18:32,650
She's allowed to write a song about it 
later.

3040
02:18:34,340 --> 02:18:37,740
Like Taylor Swift,
she will write a song about your.

3041
02:18:38,420 --> 02:18:40,490
Especially if she doesn't.
If she breaks up with you,

3042
02:18:40,491 --> 02:18:43,010
she'll still wrote a song about the 
Salton Song.

3043
02:18:43,011 --> 02:18:43,880
We know what she did.

3044
02:18:44,610 --> 02:18:49,610
You think you're the king.
You might be the king of a small desert 

3045
02:18:52,771 --> 02:18:57,771
country with a lot of natural resources,
but you don't have apathy back and 

3046
02:19:00,450 --> 02:19:00,660
forth.

3047
02:19:01,090 --> 02:19:06,090
Hey,
ruined my whole country.

3048
02:19:06,280 --> 02:19:09,820
Taylor swift song.
She's got those little cute pouty lips.

3049
02:19:09,821 --> 02:19:14,821
You just want to turn his song pop.
I'm wonder what is the highest level of 

3050
02:19:15,221 --> 02:19:18,130
celebrity that's been paid to fuck?
Like a prince.

3051
02:19:18,400 --> 02:19:21,310
Like one of those Saudi Arabian dudes 
were just stupid cat.

3052
02:19:21,360 --> 02:19:26,360
Like the CALC.
I think it goes all the way up to the 

3053
02:19:26,360 --> 02:19:26,360
top.
I think really,

3054
02:19:26,360 --> 02:19:29,880
I think,
I think we're given like female top 

3055
02:19:29,880 --> 02:19:29,880
celebrities.

3056
02:19:29,880 --> 02:19:29,880
Too much credit.
Really?

3057
02:19:29,880 --> 02:19:31,250
Yes.
Wow.

3058
02:19:31,490 --> 02:19:34,920
Strong words from Ian Edwards would have
to agree with that 100 percent really?

3059
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:36,680
Because you know,
it's like women,

3060
02:19:36,681 --> 02:19:38,630
like an adventure man.
They'll do that shit.

3061
02:19:39,130 --> 02:19:41,720
Why Venture?
They do it for money.

3062
02:19:41,790 --> 02:19:44,120
Actresses important stories are very 
similar.

3063
02:19:44,750 --> 02:19:47,210
Are they really getting paid to do 
whatever the fuck,

3064
02:19:47,230 --> 02:19:48,560
you know,
like it's money.

3065
02:19:48,561 --> 02:19:49,120
It's like,
what?

3066
02:19:49,160 --> 02:19:51,060
I'll get that for that to do this.
Okay.

3067
02:19:51,230 --> 02:19:51,860
One time.

3068
02:19:53,000 --> 02:19:56,690
The Sultan of Brunei,
his girls.

3069
02:19:56,691 --> 02:19:57,380
There's A.
Yeah,

3070
02:19:57,381 --> 02:20:02,381
there's a whole fucking.
There's a bunch of different stories 

3071
02:20:02,381 --> 02:20:02,420
about it.
The swinging salt.

3072
02:20:02,450 --> 02:20:04,940
Who's telling the truth?
Let's say there's a question.

3073
02:20:05,600 --> 02:20:07,270
Who's telling the truth?
Is it the girls?

3074
02:20:07,280 --> 02:20:12,280
You can't trust those girls either 
because if the girls want to fuck a guy 

3075
02:20:12,280 --> 02:20:12,280
from money,
she'll probably make lies up about it.

3076
02:20:12,600 --> 02:20:17,300
But if a chicken describe inside the 
castle or wherever that in there

3077
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:18,690
was like.
Yeah.

3078
02:20:19,330 --> 02:20:21,040
Yeah.
I don't know man.

3079
02:20:22,450 --> 02:20:26,530
I don't know the guy,
the guy obviously without a doubt.

3080
02:20:26,740 --> 02:20:28,910
Obviously his paid some chicks for 
pussy.

3081
02:20:29,310 --> 02:20:34,310
Okay.
He's got something like a trillion 

3082
02:20:34,310 --> 02:20:37,680
dollars.
So when you're just a regular looking 

3083
02:20:37,680 --> 02:20:37,990
dude and you got a trillion dollars and 
you're like,

3084
02:20:39,040 --> 02:20:41,520
how much you're gonna have to pair,
and then you just decide,

3085
02:20:41,521 --> 02:20:43,720
like put together your own disco in your
house.

3086
02:20:44,200 --> 02:20:45,460
Fucking why not,
man?

3087
02:20:45,780 --> 02:20:47,050
Yeah.
What's the problem?

3088
02:20:48,640 --> 02:20:49,280
He,
uh,

3089
02:20:49,281 --> 02:20:54,281
apparently he owns the Beverly Hills 
Hotel and it has home in Las Vegas.

3090
02:20:54,580 --> 02:20:58,300
He claimed exemption from us to 
jurisdiction as a foreign head of state.

3091
02:20:58,630 --> 02:21:02,380
So they were trying to bring him.
They're suing him.

3092
02:21:03,250 --> 02:21:04,840
Who's sewing them?
Some woman,

3093
02:21:05,200 --> 02:21:06,550
some woman who,
uh,

3094
02:21:06,610 --> 02:21:07,470
he,
uh,

3095
02:21:07,540 --> 02:21:09,790
was uh,
trying to fuck.

3096
02:21:09,820 --> 02:21:12,520
This is a story her,
her name is.

3097
02:21:12,760 --> 02:21:15,310
She's a former Miss USA.
Her name is,

3098
02:21:15,311 --> 02:21:17,160
uh,
let's just say her name is Shannon.

3099
02:21:17,170 --> 02:21:19,720
We don't have to say her full name.
You can google it if you want.

3100
02:21:19,721 --> 02:21:23,050
We want defame her publicly.
Let's call her country.

3101
02:21:23,420 --> 02:21:28,420
And it got hired and she says she 
innocently accepted a $3,000

3102
02:21:29,480 --> 02:21:34,480
a day assignment in Brunei for personal 
appearances and promotional work in the 

3103
02:21:35,411 --> 02:21:40,411
company of six other American women.
She alleges she was made to dance 

3104
02:21:40,411 --> 02:21:41,800
nightly from 10 till 3:00
AM,

3105
02:21:41,830 --> 02:21:45,430
groped and called a whore.
She was barred from leaving the country.

3106
02:21:45,431 --> 02:21:48,130
She alleges when she refused to 
prostitute herself,

3107
02:21:48,400 --> 02:21:53,400
she was not raped,
nor apparently did she have sex with 

3108
02:21:53,400 --> 02:21:53,400
anyone.
Instead,

3109
02:21:53,400 --> 02:21:55,600
this devout Christian girl from Malibu 
is suing for mental anguish,

3110
02:21:55,690 --> 02:21:57,670
nightmares,
difficulty sleeping,

3111
02:21:57,700 --> 02:22:02,700
and other trauma.
Although she never claimed to have met 

3112
02:22:02,700 --> 02:22:02,700
the salt in or his brother.
Wow.

3113
02:22:02,700 --> 02:22:04,270
She never even met the salt and she 
didn't even get that far.

3114
02:22:04,271 --> 02:22:05,680
You gotta go through all those other 
boys.

3115
02:22:06,200 --> 02:22:09,070
You got to be proven that you're down.
You DTF.

3116
02:22:09,280 --> 02:22:13,540
She was allegedly forced onto to be a 
private dancer in his palace grounds and

3117
02:22:13,541 --> 02:22:14,770
did not like it.
One bit.

3118
02:22:14,771 --> 02:22:19,771
Her lawsuit is laden with phrases such 
as white slavery and Human Chattel.

3119
02:22:20,350 --> 02:22:21,490
Chattel means.
Yeah.

3120
02:22:21,550 --> 02:22:26,100
What is c h a t t e l l or c h a

3121
02:22:26,100 --> 02:22:27,390
t t e l.
What does that mean?

3122
02:22:27,391 --> 02:22:30,540
This is from 1997 by the way.
This is before the Internet.

3123
02:22:32,580 --> 02:22:33,960
So I guess,
um,

3124
02:22:34,020 --> 02:22:34,620
she put,
uh,

3125
02:22:34,621 --> 02:22:36,960
a lawsuit out,
but he's a,

3126
02:22:37,560 --> 02:22:39,900
he's exempt.
He doesn't have to,

3127
02:22:39,901 --> 02:22:44,901
uh,
he doesn't have to appear and deal with 

3128
02:22:44,901 --> 02:22:47,691
all the bullshit.
It sounds to me like she thought that 

3129
02:22:47,691 --> 02:22:48,630
she was going to be smarter than that 
and she wasn't gonna have to fuck them.

3130
02:22:48,890 --> 02:22:51,930
It was probably pretty obvious.
You getting paid 3000 bucks a night.

3131
02:22:52,040 --> 02:22:55,830
It's either that or she's insulted.
She didn't get to fuck the prince.

3132
02:22:56,730 --> 02:22:57,540
Prince.
Yeah.

3133
02:22:57,580 --> 02:22:59,380
To deal with these underlings.
I didn't even meet them.

3134
02:22:59,760 --> 02:23:02,700
That's probably exactly what it is.
She probably thought she would play him.

3135
02:23:02,970 --> 02:23:07,970
You know,
there's a lot of chicks that have a 

3136
02:23:07,970 --> 02:23:07,970
ridiculous amount of confidence.
Like,

3137
02:23:07,970 --> 02:23:11,180
I'm going to be the one.
I need to see the salt and have you to 

3138
02:23:11,180 --> 02:23:11,550
see the Salton.
I'm not getting $3,000

3139
02:23:11,551 --> 02:23:14,670
a night to dance for you.
I am not like these regular checks.

3140
02:23:14,671 --> 02:23:15,790
I'm better.
Yeah.

3141
02:23:15,800 --> 02:23:18,930
I need to meet the salted.
I wonder how many he has in his Harem.

3142
02:23:21,000 --> 02:23:23,680
Why Brian Stop you stopped with that 
number seven.

3143
02:23:23,800 --> 02:23:26,160
Fucking try to insert that everywhere.
You think that's cute.

3144
02:23:27,450 --> 02:23:29,550
How many things he has.
I mean if you were going to rock it like

3145
02:23:29,551 --> 02:23:30,630
that,
would you go with 20?

3146
02:23:30,690 --> 02:23:31,590
I was being honest.
No,

3147
02:23:31,591 --> 02:23:36,591
I'd probably.
It's probably something small and not 

3148
02:23:36,591 --> 02:23:36,591
too crazy,
but not too little.

3149
02:23:36,790 --> 02:23:39,990
Not too little for 14 is good.
14.

3150
02:23:40,200 --> 02:23:42,730
Do you think there's too many?
You would like seven.

3151
02:23:43,090 --> 02:23:44,530
If you had,
let's say,

3152
02:23:44,920 --> 02:23:47,260
Brian,
if you had a billion dollars

3153
02:23:48,770 --> 02:23:51,320
I would have around seven,
but all different.

3154
02:23:51,321 --> 02:23:52,760
Like I one black,
one Asian,

3155
02:23:52,761 --> 02:23:54,800
one purple,
whatever.

3156
02:23:55,070 --> 02:23:56,480
But here's the thing.
You've got to think about.

3157
02:23:56,780 --> 02:24:01,780
Seven is good for you,
but anybody that has anything that they 

3158
02:24:01,780 --> 02:24:02,270
like,
they want to show it off.

3159
02:24:02,510 --> 02:24:07,510
So you're going to have the boys over 
and you're gonna throw some parties 

3160
02:24:07,510 --> 02:24:08,780
apparently at any given time.
He had more than 40 girls.

3161
02:24:08,900 --> 02:24:11,070
Forty Hugh hefner.
Usually.

3162
02:24:11,330 --> 02:24:15,210
How many did he rocked for a while?
Just kind of married the son before love

3163
02:24:15,410 --> 02:24:20,410
before that he had like,
he had like how many girlfriends he at 

3164
02:24:20,410 --> 02:24:20,410
one time he had like seven girlfriends 
or something like that.

3165
02:24:20,440 --> 02:24:21,820
I Dunno,
I don't.

3166
02:24:22,620 --> 02:24:24,580
Uh,
I think that was the story,

3167
02:24:25,090 --> 02:24:27,440
but I think a lot of them was acting,
you know,

3168
02:24:27,460 --> 02:24:29,160
it was like he was like putting on this 
act.

3169
02:24:29,170 --> 02:24:34,170
I always thought the,
that's why I made that whole bit about 

3170
02:24:34,170 --> 02:24:36,661
him.
I always thought that I was kind of 

3171
02:24:36,661 --> 02:24:36,661
gross.
It was like,

3172
02:24:36,661 --> 02:24:36,661
it was like this,
like look at me,

3173
02:24:36,661 --> 02:24:38,920
I've got my smoking jacket on.
It was like so contrived,

3174
02:24:38,921 --> 02:24:43,921
all of it and the girls would all tell 
stories about how the fuck other guys 

3175
02:24:43,921 --> 02:24:47,491
and try to sneak out and that they are,
a lot of them had boyfriends and shit 

3176
02:24:47,491 --> 02:24:50,461
and,
or one of them is to come to the comedy 

3177
02:24:50,461 --> 02:24:50,461
store and she would just tell horrible 
things about what it was like.

3178
02:24:50,461 --> 02:24:53,980
He had to watch gay porn and it's like 
Weird Shay had to watch gay porn.

3179
02:24:53,981 --> 02:24:56,110
He would watch it.
Like he would watch gay porn.

3180
02:24:56,460 --> 02:24:58,030
He had a,
he had a lot of gay experiences.

3181
02:24:58,031 --> 02:25:00,240
Book talks all about it.
Yeah.

3182
02:25:00,530 --> 02:25:03,730
Some girl wrote a tell all book about 
how he looks watching gay porn things in

3183
02:25:03,731 --> 02:25:04,730
his ass and shit.
Yeah.

3184
02:25:04,750 --> 02:25:09,750
Apparently at one point in time he had 
like a lot of those dudes in the 

3185
02:25:09,750 --> 02:25:09,780
sixties,
they,

3186
02:25:09,790 --> 02:25:14,790
they,
they tried fucking dudes for a little 

3187
02:25:14,790 --> 02:25:14,790
while.
They were like,

3188
02:25:14,790 --> 02:25:14,790
try gay.

3189
02:25:14,790 --> 02:25:17,300
Just fucking dudes.
That happened.

3190
02:25:17,700 --> 02:25:20,010
That happened.
A lot of guys gave that a shot.

3191
02:25:20,011 --> 02:25:24,340
It was like sort of like this,
this idea of rebelling completely

3192
02:25:24,340 --> 02:25:29,340
from the roles,
the gender roles that were established 

3193
02:25:29,340 --> 02:25:29,590
by our parents who obviously were wrong 
about everything else.

3194
02:25:29,620 --> 02:25:34,620
Was it the rat pack that started it?
Are seen as more like dudes who took 

3195
02:25:34,620 --> 02:25:34,620
acid?
See,

3196
02:25:34,620 --> 02:25:35,440
I think we were on acid.
You wouldn't want to do it,

3197
02:25:35,441 --> 02:25:39,280
but like if you're hanging out with 
Sammy and all the guys and getting drunk

3198
02:25:39,281 --> 02:25:41,060
and you know,
playing around with sticks.

3199
02:25:49,660 --> 02:25:54,660
Visual Sammy,
show us that black truck.

3200
02:25:55,370 --> 02:26:00,370
That's why you're here.
Show us that black cock and dense you 

3201
02:26:00,370 --> 02:26:00,370
son of a bitch.
Let me suck it out.

3202
02:26:00,370 --> 02:26:00,520
Suck it off.

3203
02:26:00,620 --> 02:26:01,490
Well that's good.
Crazy.

3204
02:26:01,860 --> 02:26:02,320
No,
like,

3205
02:26:02,321 --> 02:26:07,321
you know,
like David Bowie was it make Jagger's 

3206
02:26:07,321 --> 02:26:08,470
wife or David Bowie's wife.
One of them claimed that they had caught

3207
02:26:08,480 --> 02:26:11,240
David Bowie and Mick Jagger in bed 
together getting their frequency,

3208
02:26:11,880 --> 02:26:16,880
everything so totally.
I think a lot of dudes back then did 

3209
02:26:16,880 --> 02:26:19,691
that.
They all look at an interview of either 

3210
02:26:19,691 --> 02:26:23,081
of them,
like on Saturday night live when they 

3211
02:26:23,081 --> 02:26:23,081
just are guests.
They always have that vibe like,

3212
02:26:23,081 --> 02:26:23,081
hey,
had the gun.

3213
02:26:23,081 --> 02:26:24,050
I tell him what to do with that.

3214
02:26:26,700 --> 02:26:28,630
Don't have that bug.
You just made that up.

3215
02:26:29,140 --> 02:26:31,690
They don't list.
You're so ridiculous.

3216
02:26:31,750 --> 02:26:35,330
That version of homosexuality was so 
fucking stereotypes.

3217
02:26:35,620 --> 02:26:40,620
They don't happen to American list real 
quick and then I'll.

3218
02:26:48,620 --> 02:26:51,830
Which guy?
David Bowie or Mick Jagger.

3219
02:26:52,670 --> 02:26:54,440
What are you gonna look them up.
Well,

3220
02:26:54,900 --> 02:26:59,900
you can show them.
Don't want to do it because they don't 

3221
02:26:59,900 --> 02:26:59,900
get banned off of you two.
Don't get banned off of Youtube.

3222
02:27:00,260 --> 02:27:05,260
We're uploading some stuff off on the 
youtube and if we do anything that has 

3223
02:27:05,260 --> 02:27:07,910
like a video that you know,
it's a clip from a movie or some shit,

3224
02:27:07,911 --> 02:27:10,330
they'll get mad at us.
It was certainly,

3225
02:27:10,750 --> 02:27:15,750
definitely.
I was going to play the Mick Jagger 

3226
02:27:15,750 --> 02:27:15,750
Saturday night live skit where it's 
just,

3227
02:27:15,750 --> 02:27:17,010
if anybody knows,
um,

3228
02:27:17,430 --> 02:27:22,430
I think there's a way where you can pay 
a certain amount of money every month 

3229
02:27:22,430 --> 02:27:26,700
and use music like as bumpers and stuff 
like that and use it and the,

3230
02:27:26,760 --> 02:27:31,760
the artists get paid.
I need to know what the best quality or 

3231
02:27:31,760 --> 02:27:35,880
the best services for that.
If such a thing exists where the artists

3232
02:27:35,881 --> 02:27:37,830
actually get compensated,
it must exist.

3233
02:27:38,220 --> 02:27:43,220
I think it would be nice if we could 
find something like that where we could 

3234
02:27:43,220 --> 02:27:45,150
know that when,
you know,

3235
02:27:45,151 --> 02:27:48,330
if we pay a certain amount of month,
we could play songs every now and

3236
02:27:49,680 --> 02:27:51,650
probably limited to like,
oh,

3237
02:27:51,651 --> 02:27:53,910
you can only play warner brothers songs,
you know,

3238
02:27:53,920 --> 02:27:55,220
it will be.
Then it'd be just like,

3239
02:27:55,221 --> 02:27:57,140
what the fuck?
Well we'll be in less.

3240
02:27:57,190 --> 02:28:00,550
We've paid for more than one service,
which I'm willing to do.

3241
02:28:00,551 --> 02:28:02,230
I'll pay you.
I'll pay for every service there is.

3242
02:28:02,231 --> 02:28:07,231
We could play everybody's shit.
I mean if it's only a few hundred 

3243
02:28:07,231 --> 02:28:07,390
dollars a month or whatever it is a 
month,

3244
02:28:07,391 --> 02:28:08,890
I don't know.

3245
02:28:09,180 --> 02:28:14,180
Would like like,
why am I looking at a man's butt wiggle 

3246
02:28:14,180 --> 02:28:16,510
back and forth?
Is that supposedly the reason why that's

3247
02:28:16,900 --> 02:28:19,180
entertaining with women is because it's 
sexual.

3248
02:28:19,300 --> 02:28:24,300
Okay.
When you see a woman shaking her ass 

3249
02:28:24,300 --> 02:28:24,300
back and forth,

3250
02:28:24,300 --> 02:28:24,920
you look at that and you go,
fuck that.

3251
02:28:25,130 --> 02:28:30,130
When you see a man's,
but in the band sticking his butt 

3252
02:28:30,130 --> 02:28:33,390
outlet,
that is equally sexual and sexual in a 

3253
02:28:33,390 --> 02:28:34,550
submissive homo sexual way,

3254
02:28:35,230 --> 02:28:36,880
Jesus,
her beds,

3255
02:28:36,881 --> 02:28:41,881
this type of behavior,
and you wonder why there's a meteor 

3256
02:28:41,881 --> 02:28:42,520
shower scheduled for tonight.

3257
02:28:44,180 --> 02:28:45,210
That's gay as fuck,
man.

3258
02:28:45,211 --> 02:28:46,560
That might be the gaze video on the 
Internet.

3259
02:28:46,620 --> 02:28:48,000
Yeah,
that's pretty up there.

3260
02:28:48,070 --> 02:28:53,070
It just implies a lot of gay sex.
Do you guys think Paul Mccartney ever 

3261
02:28:53,070 --> 02:28:53,070
had sex with Michael Jackson?

3262
02:28:54,840 --> 02:28:55,950
I don't think it's.
You know,

3263
02:28:56,040 --> 02:29:01,040
I heard the most compelling and haunting
idea about Michael Jackson was that he 

3264
02:29:02,071 --> 02:29:05,100
was castrated.
I think I heard that before.

3265
02:29:05,400 --> 02:29:10,400
That's a fucked up thing because the 
idea is,

3266
02:29:10,441 --> 02:29:12,810
and this is some crazy horse shit.
Okay.

3267
02:29:12,811 --> 02:29:17,811
I don't even want to entertain this 
other than the fact that there's things 

3268
02:29:17,811 --> 02:29:20,190
called [inaudible] and pull this up 
because,

3269
02:29:20,191 --> 02:29:22,170
um,
you want to hear some of this.

3270
02:29:22,950 --> 02:29:27,950
The castrati is a specific type of 
performer that is castrated,

3271
02:29:28,720 --> 02:29:32,420
[inaudible] to achieve a certain pitch 
because it's a man,

3272
02:29:32,490 --> 02:29:37,490
a male pitch mixed with the way a woman 
Castrati like castrate,

3273
02:29:39,420 --> 02:29:44,420
not cal cal zone.
Yeah.

3274
02:29:45,550 --> 02:29:47,820
Castrati.
These were famous.

3275
02:29:47,910 --> 02:29:52,910
See that thing.
That is the thing that guys holding up 

3276
02:29:52,910 --> 02:29:53,730
that they're making fun of Justin Bieber
there saying he's a Castrati,

3277
02:29:53,731 --> 02:29:58,731
but in effect it's a very similar type 
of sound that Justin Bieber makes 

3278
02:29:58,731 --> 02:30:02,150
because Justin bieber's sound is made 
because he doesn't have any.

3279
02:30:02,170 --> 02:30:05,310
Just astro and was young.
This guy has a clipper that he's holding

3280
02:30:05,311 --> 02:30:10,311
up and that is the actual tool that they
used to use to cut your fucking balls 

3281
02:30:10,311 --> 02:30:14,511
off to make you sing different and you 
would develop like this real kind of 

3282
02:30:14,511 --> 02:30:19,101
like halfway feminine way of looking.
And they were Unix essentially,

3283
02:30:19,320 --> 02:30:24,320
but they did it on purpose to make them 
sound a certain way when they sang.

3284
02:30:25,710 --> 02:30:28,710
And it's really fucking hard to believe 
that that's real,

3285
02:30:28,860 --> 02:30:30,270
but it is.
And if you,

3286
02:30:30,300 --> 02:30:32,340
if you google it,
I'm like,

3287
02:30:32,341 --> 02:30:36,640
sounds of a Castrati,
you can hear them singing and it's so.

3288
02:30:36,780 --> 02:30:40,950
It's a weird fucking.
It's a weird sound that they do,

3289
02:30:40,951 --> 02:30:41,400
man.

3290
02:30:44,330 --> 02:30:45,430
The thing,
Michael Jackson,

3291
02:30:45,431 --> 02:30:50,431
they one thing with him,
like when he was up for that trial and 

3292
02:30:50,431 --> 02:30:53,821
the cops arrested him,
like when the plane landed and you 

3293
02:30:53,821 --> 02:30:54,640
complain about how they handled him,

3294
02:30:55,480 --> 02:30:59,680
search dominated,
touched his penis.

3295
02:31:02,540 --> 02:31:05,100
But um,
if his balls was admitted,

3296
02:31:05,320 --> 02:31:07,960
having a penis back there,
if they were extracted,

3297
02:31:08,790 --> 02:31:10,970
castrating doesn't mean they cut your 
dick off the ball.

3298
02:31:11,040 --> 02:31:13,330
They cut your balls off and they don't 
even have to cut your balls off.

3299
02:31:13,360 --> 02:31:18,360
They can just snip them and pulled a 
little fucking little sperm makers out 

3300
02:31:18,851 --> 02:31:20,100
of there.
And then the testosterone

3301
02:31:20,100 --> 02:31:25,100
production essentially done.
Look at my face as you're seeing this 

3302
02:31:25,100 --> 02:31:28,830
Chili.
But it's an unbelievable thing in the 

3303
02:31:28,830 --> 02:31:28,830
whole entire world.
Look at,

3304
02:31:28,830 --> 02:31:31,500
this is fucking crazy.
They used to do this to babies.

3305
02:31:31,860 --> 02:31:36,860
They used to do this to kids before 
puberty so that they can achieve that 

3306
02:31:36,860 --> 02:31:36,860
sort of sound.

3307
02:31:38,020 --> 02:31:38,470
Yeah,

3308
02:31:39,080 --> 02:31:41,060
it's really.
The baby can sing.

3309
02:31:41,660 --> 02:31:44,090
Well,
they teach them how to sing.

3310
02:31:45,330 --> 02:31:45,710
Gee.

3311
02:31:45,920 --> 02:31:47,960
Yeah.
Seventy percent.

3312
02:31:48,440 --> 02:31:53,440
And this is during the Baroque period.
Seventy percent of all opera singers see

3313
02:31:54,480 --> 02:31:59,480
where Castrati 70 percent of them were 
young boys that they took and cut their 

3314
02:31:59,901 --> 02:32:04,180
fucking balls off to.
This is between 1,617

3315
02:32:04,210 --> 02:32:05,250
50.
Luciano,

3316
02:32:05,380 --> 02:32:06,460
Australia,
they,

3317
02:32:06,461 --> 02:32:07,130
they,
they,

3318
02:32:07,580 --> 02:32:11,690
they comprise 70 percent of all operatic
singers and that nuts.

3319
02:32:11,880 --> 02:32:13,590
That's bananas.
That is,

3320
02:32:13,650 --> 02:32:15,480
that is fucking terrifying,
man.

3321
02:32:16,010 --> 02:32:21,010
Check this out.
Look how Larry says we accepted this 

3322
02:32:21,010 --> 02:32:21,330
back in the eighties because everyone 
loved Michael Jackson so much,

3323
02:32:21,360 --> 02:32:26,360
but it was like,
look at this muscular guy and then we 

3324
02:32:26,360 --> 02:32:28,331
are supposed to believe that Michael 
Jackson is having an arm wrestling 

3325
02:32:28,331 --> 02:32:32,331
competition in this guy and wins.
Oh yeah.

3326
02:32:35,950 --> 02:32:38,660
That doesn't make any sense.
There's got magic.

3327
02:32:39,560 --> 02:32:40,820
Yeah.
He's supposed to be magic.

3328
02:32:40,840 --> 02:32:45,840
What the fuck?
That's just stop and think about that 

3329
02:32:45,840 --> 02:32:50,071
man.
Seventy percent of all their fucking 

3330
02:32:50,071 --> 02:32:51,880
opera singers were castrated.
What a weird time in history.

3331
02:32:51,881 --> 02:32:55,710
That must've been around for centuries,
the 16 hundreds,

3332
02:32:55,900 --> 02:33:00,410
1600 to 1750.
It's called the Baroque period that mean

3333
02:33:00,411 --> 02:33:02,800
that is so fucking hard to wrap your 
head around man,

3334
02:33:02,980 --> 02:33:05,170
and apparently it was devastating for 
their,

3335
02:33:05,171 --> 02:33:05,770
their,
their,

3336
02:33:06,280 --> 02:33:09,570
their emotions like they were crazy.
They fought,

3337
02:33:09,610 --> 02:33:14,610
they suffered.
The effects of development or 

3338
02:33:14,610 --> 02:33:17,640
developmental hypogonadism develop 
developmental hypogonadism including 

3339
02:33:18,821 --> 02:33:21,520
infant tile,
penis and the underdeveloped prostate.

3340
02:33:21,760 --> 02:33:25,810
They also had more developed 
subcutaneous fat and the normal male fat

3341
02:33:25,811 --> 02:33:28,540
deposits local last on the hips,
buttocks and breasts areas,

3342
02:33:29,110 --> 02:33:34,110
fatty deposits on the eyelids and skin 
that sometimes appeared wrinkled or 

3343
02:33:34,110 --> 02:33:35,740
swollen because they had no testosterone
ever.

3344
02:33:36,080 --> 02:33:38,590
The arms,
the legs of many Castrati were unusually

3345
02:33:38,591 --> 02:33:42,130
long as compared to their torso.
The long bones never stopped growing,

3346
02:33:42,131 --> 02:33:45,070
which made them look distorted.
Wow,

3347
02:33:45,310 --> 02:33:46,630
that's nuts,
man.

3348
02:33:47,430 --> 02:33:50,180
Lot of personality disorders.
It's creative.

3349
02:33:50,200 --> 02:33:52,570
You got to pull some of the sound up.
They'll pull some quotes

3350
02:33:53,240 --> 02:33:54,210
of what?
Oh,

3351
02:33:54,211 --> 02:33:56,850
you mean people trust strati singer.
Even if the operation like,

3352
02:33:57,390 --> 02:33:58,840
no,
I don't.

3353
02:33:58,860 --> 02:34:02,160
I mean,
that sounds like he was too skinny to be

3354
02:34:02,250 --> 02:34:03,440
a cast.
A cast rate,

3355
02:34:03,441 --> 02:34:05,520
a person.
It sounds like if they contain that much

3356
02:34:05,530 --> 02:34:06,630
fat,
they hold that much fat.

3357
02:34:06,631 --> 02:34:11,631
It wouldn't be real unless he had the 
money to get perfect tits and shit like 

3358
02:34:11,631 --> 02:34:11,631
that.
I don't think that's it.

3359
02:34:11,631 --> 02:34:11,631
I think,
uh,

3360
02:34:12,060 --> 02:34:13,530
the ideas that he,
uh,

3361
02:34:15,180 --> 02:34:16,980
he,
even when you take someone's balls,

3362
02:34:17,290 --> 02:34:18,790
that's it.
There's no more balls.

3363
02:34:19,140 --> 02:34:21,800
Go.
Go to Castrati singing on a,

3364
02:34:21,940 --> 02:34:22,720
on youtube.

3365
02:34:24,520 --> 02:34:29,520
Another thing about Michael Jackson,
like the people that I know that norm 

3366
02:34:29,520 --> 02:34:29,520
said he had a deep voice.
What?

3367
02:34:29,620 --> 02:34:33,910
Never heard that what?
Like yeah man,

3368
02:34:33,911 --> 02:34:35,730
get the fuck out of my house.
Was his,

3369
02:34:36,060 --> 02:34:38,280
that was his,
like public voice like that.

3370
02:34:39,120 --> 02:34:40,360
But it made me like,
Yo,

3371
02:34:40,361 --> 02:34:42,110
what's up man?
How you doing real?

3372
02:34:42,140 --> 02:34:44,010
I swear to God.
I met several people.

3373
02:34:44,320 --> 02:34:49,320
Told me that shit.
Imagine Michael Jackson was yelling at 

3374
02:34:49,320 --> 02:34:49,690
you.
Get Out of my house.

3375
02:34:49,730 --> 02:34:50,410
You're like,
what?

3376
02:34:53,290 --> 02:34:53,920
Did you find it?

3377
02:35:00,390 --> 02:35:01,670
This is not real.
Brian.

3378
02:35:01,700 --> 02:35:02,170
Stop.
Stop.

3379
02:35:02,370 --> 02:35:04,650
That's a movie.
You got to get a real castrati.

3380
02:35:04,800 --> 02:35:05,530
Go to,
uh,

3381
02:35:05,580 --> 02:35:09,330
Alessandra Maurecio dot the last cross 
Toronto.

3382
02:35:10,220 --> 02:35:10,600
He was,

3383
02:35:11,860 --> 02:35:16,860
that's actually a biography.
That's a film about a real life 

3384
02:35:16,860 --> 02:35:17,570
customer.
Oh.

3385
02:35:17,580 --> 02:35:19,400
So it's like a biopic.
Yeah.

3386
02:35:19,460 --> 02:35:19,980
Well I was just.

3387
02:35:20,100 --> 02:35:23,820
I just wanted to get the original sound.
There's a dude from 18,

3388
02:35:23,821 --> 02:35:26,080
58.
He was one of the last one.

3389
02:35:27,000 --> 02:35:30,940
He's got a beautiful face.
I don't think he's Kinda fat faced.

3390
02:35:32,320 --> 02:35:35,120
Were pitching for the pushing.
This is a.

3391
02:35:35,750 --> 02:35:38,160
This is that movie again.
This is not real.

3392
02:35:38,310 --> 02:35:41,730
This is actually just the audio or the 
audio supposedly.

3393
02:35:41,731 --> 02:35:43,200
Only have the audio.
Okay.

3394
02:35:43,201 --> 02:35:43,980
Let's hear this shit.

3395
02:35:52,970 --> 02:35:54,230
16,
14.

3396
02:35:57,160 --> 02:35:59,440
How do they have recordings from 16,
14.

3397
02:35:59,441 --> 02:36:00,620
They made records back then.

3398
02:36:02,600 --> 02:36:07,600
No,
it was a famous castrati throughout 

3399
02:36:07,600 --> 02:36:07,600
history.
That's what this is.

3400
02:36:07,600 --> 02:36:11,000
This is a real castrati voice over 
images of famous Castrati is because 

3401
02:36:11,000 --> 02:36:11,550
they didn't have records back then,
man.

3402
02:36:14,080 --> 02:36:16,570
When was the first record?
I think as the 20th century.

3403
02:36:19,460 --> 02:36:20,740
When was the first record made?

3404
02:36:24,720 --> 02:36:26,600
Siri.
Nineteen.

3405
02:36:26,610 --> 02:36:27,070
Oh,
three.

3406
02:36:31,360 --> 02:36:31,650
Hmm.

3407
02:36:33,020 --> 02:36:38,020
No,
I'm Thomas Edison recorded his voice on 

3408
02:36:38,020 --> 02:36:39,900
a piece of tin foil and 18 slash 77.
Wow.

3409
02:36:39,960 --> 02:36:41,160
In 18,
89,

3410
02:36:41,161 --> 02:36:44,550
Edison and Columbia began to sell signal
cylinders in 18,

3411
02:36:44,551 --> 02:36:49,200
92 berlinger berliner began to sell 
disks.

3412
02:36:49,380 --> 02:36:51,900
So it looks like the 18 hundreds.
So play it,

3413
02:36:51,901 --> 02:36:53,130
play that shit and this,
listen to this.

3414
02:36:53,131 --> 02:36:55,110
This is a guy with no balls and then in 
2000,

3415
02:36:55,111 --> 02:36:58,800
10 hours listening to Taylor swift,
but that's a girl.

3416
02:36:59,490 --> 02:37:00,730
Girls do shit for girls,
man.

3417
02:37:00,770 --> 02:37:02,580
Imagine being a girl living in this 
crazy world

3418
02:37:02,980 --> 02:37:04,720
kind of give them,
given their bullshit.

3419
02:37:09,250 --> 02:37:11,610
It's a strange sound.
You know what?

3420
02:37:11,780 --> 02:37:13,630
Where's that guy?
That's a drawing.

3421
02:37:14,080 --> 02:37:16,010
That's how stupid they are.
They didn't have

3422
02:37:16,010 --> 02:37:17,480
cameras.
These dumb asses.

3423
02:37:17,800 --> 02:37:20,150
The pictures of these people.
You don't know what the fuck that first.

3424
02:37:22,880 --> 02:37:24,560
That was.
That was what you did back then.

3425
02:37:24,640 --> 02:37:26,780
He had someone draw you like,
yes.

3426
02:37:26,781 --> 02:37:29,750
That is what it looked like.
They barely had mirrors these dummies.

3427
02:37:30,480 --> 02:37:33,440
Chop and balls off.
I think they knew what the fuck was up.

3428
02:37:34,880 --> 02:37:37,160
Joe Pesci,
Giovanni,

3429
02:37:38,990 --> 02:37:43,350
Giovanni Ngud only he'd have an old d.
Oh,

3430
02:37:43,540 --> 02:37:48,540
guide down guadalupe and Fed Nando's.
10 Duci.

3431
02:37:49,480 --> 02:37:53,020
What a shock that the Catholics are the 
ones that are kind of kids calls off.

3432
02:37:53,030 --> 02:37:58,030
It's very fucking psychos.
Other faces look like they just smelled 

3433
02:37:58,030 --> 02:38:01,220
a fart.
Those are grandmother Peci d,

3434
02:38:01,790 --> 02:38:05,990
no bowls.
But listen to my voice.

3435
02:38:06,080 --> 02:38:09,620
Domenico Bodine.
Seventeen 81 to question mark,

3436
02:38:09,630 --> 02:38:10,880
maybe still alive,

3437
02:38:11,850 --> 02:38:12,930
not zero

3438
02:38:14,000 --> 02:38:18,570
Zuni.
The Zuni Luigi much use.

3439
02:38:19,140 --> 02:38:22,090
It's an amazing thing that this famous 
Castrati.

3440
02:38:23,320 --> 02:38:28,320
What can you imagine giving your son to 
someone to hack his balls off so he 

3441
02:38:29,321 --> 02:38:30,580
could sing in a weird way.

3442
02:38:30,780 --> 02:38:32,360
People were so poor back then.
It was like this.

3443
02:38:32,370 --> 02:38:37,370
The only way out God like opera was like
white people's basketball like that.

3444
02:38:39,660 --> 02:38:44,660
But you have a chance to be a 
construction from Nike camp.

3445
02:38:48,631 --> 02:38:52,560
You know the customer already put spot 
was a Nike camp is so fucking funny.

3446
02:38:53,100 --> 02:38:58,100
Dude.
White People's basketball from the 16 

3447
02:38:58,100 --> 02:39:00,201
hundreds.
Singing is the way I like the way out 

3448
02:39:00,201 --> 02:39:01,050
has changed so many times with different
races,

3449
02:39:01,051 --> 02:39:05,220
like whatever it was the viable way.
Like you just have a kid,

3450
02:39:05,221 --> 02:39:06,450
you can't take care of them.
You're like,

3451
02:39:06,510 --> 02:39:11,510
here Andrew,
my son and hopefully you can sing and 

3452
02:39:11,510 --> 02:39:15,850
fight and shit and it's like put them in
this farm of like kids raising them and 

3453
02:39:16,520 --> 02:39:21,520
somebody is feeding them in.
This hopefully will be the one that 

3454
02:39:21,520 --> 02:39:22,320
turns out to be one of these.
Gets a painting.

3455
02:39:22,890 --> 02:39:24,150
It's just Michael Jackson's.

3456
02:39:24,760 --> 02:39:28,330
Remember when he stopped playing Mrs 
Pepsi Commercial,

3457
02:39:28,720 --> 02:39:32,260
but remember when the commercials were 
even amazing,

3458
02:39:32,290 --> 02:39:35,980
like you'd like the Pepsi Cola.
He had his brothers along with him too.

3459
02:39:36,400 --> 02:39:38,050
He brought the Jackson five.
They were like,

3460
02:39:38,051 --> 02:39:39,430
yeah,
we're still in this together,

3461
02:39:40,030 --> 02:39:44,740
but after a while it's not really.
Oh my gosh.

3462
02:39:45,460 --> 02:39:50,390
I wonder if this is going to.
Yeah,

3463
02:39:52,140 --> 02:39:57,130
he's the one that's the fresh prince of 
Broadway.

3464
02:39:57,400 --> 02:39:58,140
Wow.
Look at this.

3465
02:39:59,290 --> 02:40:04,210
Can you ever break dance?
Like singing?

3466
02:40:04,211 --> 02:40:09,130
You're the Pepsi generation and he's 
singing it as Billie Jean.

3467
02:40:14,160 --> 02:40:19,160
It's so gross.
It's so gross that Pepsi gave her enough

3468
02:40:19,861 --> 02:40:22,060
money to do this kid's wearing 
sweatpants.

3469
02:40:22,080 --> 02:40:23,570
You can address up a little,
but it's the same.

3470
02:40:23,630 --> 02:40:28,630
I'm guaranteed we're going to get 
flagged for this because it's the same 

3471
02:40:28,630 --> 02:40:28,630
song.
The same fucking beat.

3472
02:40:28,630 --> 02:40:32,160
It's the same song.
So much doubt it,

3473
02:40:32,240 --> 02:40:32,730
man.
I bet.

3474
02:40:32,850 --> 02:40:33,630
I bet.
I bet.

3475
02:40:33,640 --> 02:40:38,640
We're looking at waving.
Goodbye and weird when you go back and 

3476
02:40:40,831 --> 02:40:42,150
see that shit,
isn't it?

3477
02:40:42,151 --> 02:40:47,151
Yeah.
I looked back at how they were 

3478
02:40:47,151 --> 02:40:48,201
addressing,
especially since like I think it was 

3479
02:40:48,201 --> 02:40:48,201
right before this or after this.

3480
02:40:48,201 --> 02:40:48,201
They burned him,
you know,

3481
02:40:48,201 --> 02:40:52,860
they burned my wiring is the commercial.
That's right.

3482
02:40:54,581 --> 02:40:56,200
They did fucked up.
Hey Man,

3483
02:40:56,250 --> 02:40:59,230
they killed Michael for that because 
right after that happened,

3484
02:40:59,380 --> 02:41:02,010
that's when all the pills happened and 
all the shit where he's,

3485
02:41:02,190 --> 02:41:03,190
you know,
depression.

3486
02:41:03,191 --> 02:41:08,191
And yeah,
it was because of that commercial and 

3487
02:41:08,191 --> 02:41:11,791
him getting in so much pain and being 
prescribed painkillers is what 

3488
02:41:11,791 --> 02:41:14,560
supposedly brought down this whole 
entire Michael Jackson from like getting

3489
02:41:14,561 --> 02:41:19,561
into drugs and all this shit.
And they still use the footage and the 

3490
02:41:19,561 --> 02:41:20,650
Pepsi commercial.
I listened.

3491
02:41:20,651 --> 02:41:21,100
I believe

3492
02:41:21,480 --> 02:41:26,480
I've told you stories of several people 
that I know that God on pain pills from 

3493
02:41:26,480 --> 02:41:28,200
her back's.
I know a pool player who did it,

3494
02:41:28,201 --> 02:41:33,201
but he had a hurt back.
It's dude was like super squeaky 

3495
02:41:33,201 --> 02:41:33,201
healthy,
didn't smoke cigarettes,

3496
02:41:33,201 --> 02:41:35,790
didn't drink.
He got all these fucking pain pills.

3497
02:41:35,791 --> 02:41:38,880
He hurt his back and they got him hooked
and he was done.

3498
02:41:38,881 --> 02:41:41,970
He became a fucking straight degenerate 
loser.

3499
02:41:42,640 --> 02:41:45,000
People tell stories about him falling 
asleep in his mashed potatoes.

3500
02:41:45,001 --> 02:41:48,630
Just literally falling asleep face 
forward and mashed potatoes.

3501
02:41:48,780 --> 02:41:53,780
And uh,
I have someone close to my family that 

3502
02:41:53,780 --> 02:41:53,780
have that regular guy,
regular job,

3503
02:41:53,940 --> 02:41:56,100
hurt his back on the job,
got on pain pills,

3504
02:41:56,130 --> 02:42:01,130
dawn just fucked his two chapters in his
life because pre pain pills and then 

3505
02:42:02,071 --> 02:42:04,350
there's post pain pills and post pain 
pills.

3506
02:42:04,351 --> 02:42:06,180
He's a fucking loser.
Pre pain pills.

3507
02:42:06,181 --> 02:42:08,220
He's taking care of his family.
He's a good guy.

3508
02:42:08,221 --> 02:42:09,660
He's working hard.
He's funny.

3509
02:42:09,960 --> 02:42:11,910
He likes to ride motorbikes on the 
weekends.

3510
02:42:11,960 --> 02:42:14,580
It seems like a normal dude post pain 
pills.

3511
02:42:14,640 --> 02:42:17,450
Fucking loser.
And it's clear as day.

3512
02:42:17,710 --> 02:42:22,710
Afraid of that shift should be.
Should be fucking terabytes of footage 

3513
02:42:22,710 --> 02:42:23,030
of him catching on fire.
Oh Wow.

3514
02:42:23,310 --> 02:42:26,130
Oh my hair's on fire now.
Oh my God.

3515
02:42:26,200 --> 02:42:28,470
He's not touching it.
Doesn't know.

3516
02:42:28,710 --> 02:42:33,710
Oh my God.
They may notice before he noticed that 

3517
02:42:33,710 --> 02:42:37,930
dude,
his hair was on fire for a few seconds 

3518
02:42:37,930 --> 02:42:38,850
and now there's just stomping his head 
on the concrete.

3519
02:42:38,930 --> 02:42:43,930
Third,
second and third degree burns on his 

3520
02:42:43,930 --> 02:42:43,930
face and scalp.
Third degrees.

3521
02:42:43,930 --> 02:42:45,210
No joke.
Oh my gosh.

3522
02:42:45,510 --> 02:42:48,010
Look at.
This is dawn Harris,

3523
02:42:48,070 --> 02:42:51,990
scorched George Jefferson and shit.
So he had to wear a wig after that.

3524
02:42:51,991 --> 02:42:52,680
I heard too,

3525
02:42:53,010 --> 02:42:55,240
so that's when he started wearing a wig 
because like,

3526
02:42:55,300 --> 02:43:00,300
you know,
we had a fucking big patch of his head 

3527
02:43:00,300 --> 02:43:02,580
was like fucked up raw.
No hair like scar tissue.

3528
02:43:02,810 --> 02:43:05,010
Like when you got like scar tissue,
10 minutes.

3529
02:43:05,011 --> 02:43:10,011
We're done.
You got scar tissue on top of your head 

3530
02:43:10,011 --> 02:43:10,011
like that.
That's got to suck.

3531
02:43:10,690 --> 02:43:11,960
Pampering pain.
It's

3532
02:43:12,090 --> 02:43:17,090
painful.
Fucking scar to burn scars all for 

3533
02:43:17,090 --> 02:43:17,440
Pepsi.
Pepsi.

3534
02:43:19,570 --> 02:43:20,710
What's your.
What's your.

3535
02:43:20,711 --> 02:43:25,711
What's your worst down the ways you 
don't want to do this and I want to 

3536
02:43:25,711 --> 02:43:25,711
live.
Okay,

3537
02:43:25,711 --> 02:43:26,950
let's think of that.
What's the way I want to live?

3538
02:43:26,951 --> 02:43:28,260
I want to live the way I'm living right

3539
02:43:28,340 --> 02:43:33,340
now.
Ian Edwards on a Goddamn podcast and 

3540
02:43:33,340 --> 02:43:33,870
telling people that needed to follow you
on twitter.

3541
02:43:34,050 --> 02:43:35,640
Need to fall.
Ian Edwards,

3542
02:43:35,641 --> 02:43:40,641
comedian.
What the fuck is the difference between 

3543
02:43:40,641 --> 02:43:41,310
a comedian in a comic?
I've been a comic or a stand up comedian

3544
02:43:41,311 --> 02:43:44,990
or something along those lines.
For how many fucking years?

3545
02:43:45,010 --> 02:43:45,840
Twenty years plus.

3546
02:43:46,260 --> 02:43:51,260
I don't know what the differences 
everybody's comic is or this unit is 

3547
02:43:51,260 --> 02:43:51,260
with that.
I don't listen to that.

3548
02:43:51,260 --> 02:43:55,930
Like my.
The only reason why I'm at Enh what's 

3549
02:43:55,930 --> 02:43:55,930
comic is shorter.
It fits on twitter.

3550
02:43:55,930 --> 02:43:56,400
Yeah,
it's better.

3551
02:43:56,460 --> 02:43:57,270
Yeah.
Yeah.

3552
02:43:57,440 --> 02:43:59,880
Like,
like if I try to put comedian a comedian

3553
02:43:59,881 --> 02:44:01,230
as a fit.
Too many,

3554
02:44:01,740 --> 02:44:06,740
too many words,
hard to retweet you and let us hear it 

3555
02:44:06,740 --> 02:44:06,900
when it was the zero ne and Edwards 
apparently.

3556
02:44:06,901 --> 02:44:07,750
Yeah,
there's a bunch of,

3557
02:44:08,000 --> 02:44:09,160
a bunch of,
a bunch of shit.

3558
02:44:09,170 --> 02:44:12,190
Even make it easier.
Just like silly in psyllium.

3559
02:44:12,270 --> 02:44:13,630
He's not silly.
That's you Betcha.

3560
02:44:15,510 --> 02:44:20,510
Thanks for the bad advice.
But we should tell everybody that he has

3561
02:44:22,591 --> 02:44:27,591
a show with Brian.
They do a show together so he doesn't 

3562
02:44:27,591 --> 02:44:28,230
show and just rebroadcast it.
He actually does it with Zara.

3563
02:44:28,520 --> 02:44:29,590
It's compromise rosters

3564
02:44:29,710 --> 02:44:34,710
session,
so preposterous sessions and that's 

3565
02:44:34,710 --> 02:44:34,710
available on itunes.
You fucks.

3566
02:44:34,710 --> 02:44:36,870
So go,
go get yourself something and follow him

3567
02:44:36,900 --> 02:44:39,510
on twitter.
Ian Edwards comic fall.

3568
02:44:39,511 --> 02:44:41,640
Brian on twitter.
That's red B,

3569
02:44:41,670 --> 02:44:43,650
a n on twitter,
right?

3570
02:44:43,651 --> 02:44:44,520
It's just red band,
right?

3571
02:44:44,550 --> 02:44:46,080
Yeah.
And uh,

3572
02:44:46,170 --> 02:44:47,790
you can follow me on twitter too,
bitch.

3573
02:44:47,870 --> 02:44:50,620
Go ahead and go buy my comedy special.
It's five bucks.

3574
02:44:50,680 --> 02:44:52,710
My best shit ever.
Saw Joe Rogan.net.

3575
02:44:52,720 --> 02:44:57,720
It's drm free.
You get like a few choices that how you 

3576
02:44:57,720 --> 02:44:59,250
want to download or stream it and 
whatever.

3577
02:44:59,280 --> 02:45:01,020
It's for real.
My best shit ever.

3578
02:45:01,470 --> 02:45:05,520
But I already got a new our son,
some plotting my next move.

3579
02:45:05,850 --> 02:45:06,730
I'm thinking,
uh,

3580
02:45:06,840 --> 02:45:10,180
April again,
I might record my next one because I,

3581
02:45:10,230 --> 02:45:10,920
I,
I,

3582
02:45:10,921 --> 02:45:13,050
um,
I like to scare the shit out of myself.

3583
02:45:13,110 --> 02:45:14,380
Were you going to do it?
I don't know.

3584
02:45:14,490 --> 02:45:15,710
Texas.
Um,

3585
02:45:15,720 --> 02:45:20,720
I'm.
Well I wanted to do the last one in 

3586
02:45:20,720 --> 02:45:23,121
Vancouver,
so maybe I could do this one in 

3587
02:45:23,121 --> 02:45:23,121
Vancouver.

3588
02:45:23,121 --> 02:45:25,670
The only problem was it was like 
problematic with taxes and paying people

3589
02:45:26,300 --> 02:45:27,890
and Shit.
No,

3590
02:45:27,900 --> 02:45:28,260
no,
no,

3591
02:45:28,261 --> 02:45:28,530
no,
no.

3592
02:45:28,531 --> 02:45:30,690
You gotTa,
you gotta pay taxes and stuff.

3593
02:45:30,750 --> 02:45:35,750
It's kind of funky.
So I might not be able to do it in 

3594
02:45:35,750 --> 02:45:35,750
Vancouver,
but if I don't do it in Vancouver,

3595
02:45:35,850 --> 02:45:38,250
Texas is a good one.
Texas is always good.

3596
02:45:38,640 --> 02:45:40,250
You know,
good energy in Texas.

3597
02:45:40,251 --> 02:45:41,040
Austin,
man,

3598
02:45:41,041 --> 02:45:42,300
that show in Austin.
Come on.

3599
02:45:42,380 --> 02:45:44,130
That's one of the greatest shows we've 
ever done.

3600
02:45:44,131 --> 02:45:45,480
Ms Dot Texas Tech.
Yeah.

3601
02:45:45,481 --> 02:45:47,600
I gotta I gotta release that.
Especially now that,

3602
02:45:47,601 --> 02:45:49,230
uh,
Alex Jones is becoming famous,

3603
02:45:49,690 --> 02:45:54,690
that backstage footage of me backstage 
hanging out with Alex Jones right until 

3604
02:45:54,690 --> 02:45:57,120
the point that I get on stage because 
it's pretty funny stuff.

3605
02:45:57,180 --> 02:45:59,400
So we'll put that on youtube.
We got a new youtube channel.

3606

3610
02:46:07,051 --> 02:46:09,410
