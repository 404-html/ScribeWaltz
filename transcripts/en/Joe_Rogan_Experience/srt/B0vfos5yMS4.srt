1
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:09,940
Well.

2
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:11,990
Good experience by day.

3
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:13,420
Joe Rogan Podcast,

4
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:18,130
Ladies and gentlemen,

5
00:00:18,131 --> 00:00:18,821
my friends,

6
00:00:18,821 --> 00:00:19,241
honey,

7
00:00:19,241 --> 00:00:19,790
honey,

8
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:20,471
Ben,

9
00:00:20,471 --> 00:00:21,410
Susan,

10
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:24,340
what's up with some guys?

11
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:24,761
Man?

12
00:00:24,761 --> 00:00:25,361
It's so weird.

13
00:00:25,361 --> 00:00:26,250
Without the ads.

14
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:27,041
Yeah,

15
00:00:27,041 --> 00:00:27,641
it's better that way.

16
00:00:27,641 --> 00:00:30,910
We smash them in later
and we were boring people.

17
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:32,910
You have to sit there and listen
to five minutes to fucking,

18
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:33,340
yeah,

19
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:35,410
about the day you reward
them that we don't have any.

20
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:36,881
No,

21
00:00:36,881 --> 00:00:37,121
no,

22
00:00:37,121 --> 00:00:37,361
no,

23
00:00:37,361 --> 00:00:38,111
no flashlights.

24
00:00:38,111 --> 00:00:38,944
It's been awhile.

25
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,050
Show our first podcast with you.

26
00:00:41,051 --> 00:00:41,741
You had Dick Pills,

27
00:00:41,741 --> 00:00:45,640
I'm pretty sure and no band took one or
you were talking about having a boner

28
00:00:45,641 --> 00:00:46,800
for like six hours though.

29
00:00:46,801 --> 00:00:47,880
Those totally unrelated.

30
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:51,090
He was getting some shit at gas
stations to tell him that I got,

31
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,560
that was the beginning of a bad addiction.

32
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:54,910
I went deep.

33
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:55,661
We did what was,

34
00:00:55,661 --> 00:00:56,820
it wasn't as many guns.

35
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:57,940
We ship involved for that.

36
00:00:57,970 --> 00:00:58,241
No,

37
00:00:58,241 --> 00:01:01,360
it's just Mexican viagara where they take
like Viagra and mixed with the acorns

38
00:01:01,361 --> 00:01:03,340
and call it a supplement
and it's just isn't it?

39
00:01:03,341 --> 00:01:03,931
You're not supposed to.

40
00:01:03,931 --> 00:01:04,780
You don't know what you're eating.

41
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:06,680
Oh word.

42
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:09,980
What it is is like if you would
by Aubrey explained it to us,

43
00:01:09,981 --> 00:01:10,700
the hustle.

44
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:15,470
If you would buy like you
know super rocket pills at
the gas station and it says

45
00:01:15,471 --> 00:01:17,360
guaranteed erection and all this jazz,

46
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:18,890
they're just selling you Viagra,

47
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:20,300
but they're doing it
without a prescription.

48
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:24,440
So they're just putting Viagra
in these pills and then saying,

49
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:24,771
oh,

50
00:01:24,771 --> 00:01:26,390
this is our super secret supplement.

51
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:27,710
And when people find out at works,

52
00:01:27,711 --> 00:01:28,940
they buy the shit out of it.

53
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:31,040
It's a way to buy viagara
without a prescription.

54
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:32,811
It's not.

55
00:01:32,811 --> 00:01:37,090
But the fines are very
low and regulating them.

56
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:37,910
Definitely.

57
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:38,630
Good question.

58
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:38,811
Well,

59
00:01:38,811 --> 00:01:39,680
the FDA regs,

60
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:43,220
they regulated if they find
out that it's actually Viagara,

61
00:01:43,221 --> 00:01:46,280
but a lot of times they don't find out
there's a million different names and

62
00:01:46,281 --> 00:01:47,960
apparently they get a small fine.

63
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:51,860
What RB said is some of the companies
will change their name and then restart up

64
00:01:51,861 --> 00:01:53,900
under a different name and did
this the same fucking shit.

65
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,100
Then what are we doing music?

66
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:57,740
What should be getting boners

67
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,160
I mean they just did change the name.

68
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:02,420
Do you just take it and then

69
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:06,230
some of them times it doesn't work.

70
00:02:06,231 --> 00:02:07,700
It's kind of like
mushrooms where it really,

71
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:11,060
it's based on what you eat I find
instead is it is never good though.

72
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:17,160
That seems like integrating motion is
doing like their knuckle over to blow up.

73
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:18,223
You guys don't do that.

74
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:20,420
It doesn't work like that.

75
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,610
Mine does not know I'm getting sad.

76
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:23,270
Oh boy.

77
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:24,500
I wish I had those extra effects.

78
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:28,190
Go to the gas station convenience store.

79
00:02:28,191 --> 00:02:29,024
We'll come back.

80
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:32,360
Apparently some of them at the
gas station or just bullshit.

81
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:32,820
Yeah.

82
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:36,460
You know some of them are just like some
scoopy herbs but how great that will do

83
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:39,080
Jack Shit that like maybe
you just works anyway.

84
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:42,140
It could if you really think
you got the super hard on pills,

85
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:47,120
the Super Chinese viagara well you just
went global with it and I was about to

86
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,193
ask the question.

87
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,820
Isn't there a uh,

88
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:52,970
a Chinese supplement where they're
using Rhinoceros Horn ground?

89
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:55,610
That's been a big fucking issue.

90
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:56,311
Yeah.

91
00:02:56,311 --> 00:03:00,520
I was at the airport the other day and
they had this big rhino photo that said I

92
00:03:00,521 --> 00:03:01,600
am not medicine.

93
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:06,490
And it was talking about the use of a
rhino horns and some eastern medicines.

94
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:07,241
Yeah.

95
00:03:07,241 --> 00:03:10,750
There's some people that really believe
if they believe it can bring good luck,

96
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:12,250
it can cure things,

97
00:03:12,251 --> 00:03:13,750
it can cure cancer.

98
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:15,800
It's kind of amazing
how you can set a trend,

99
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:16,800
you know what I mean?

100
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,640
Like obviously like that's a terrible,

101
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,593
terrible trend,

102
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,800
right?

103
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,480
It takes one person to be like,

104
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:25,400
I ground up this rock.

105
00:03:25,401 --> 00:03:26,420
I found him in backyard.

106
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:27,573
It's

107
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:29,360
50 bucks.

108
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:30,590
The best ones,

109
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:31,610
just my childhood.

110
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:34,130
So Rhino seven,

111
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,090
it's the best one should

112
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:41,960
look at the explosion
was running through fire.

113
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,890
How bad would your life soc if you
saw a rhino running through fire,

114
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:49,910
like could you imagine if you like
in a forest fire and you're trapped

115
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:52,523
and I'll write up

116
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:55,343
what

117
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:00,430
did you have cleats on the rhino is

118
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:03,100
is running through like
this burst of fire.

119
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,630
That would be the worst thing.

120
00:04:04,631 --> 00:04:06,970
You keep one of the worst things
on earth or you could ever say

121
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,630
that's kind of imagine your life.

122
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:09,883
Honestly,

123
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:10,221
we've talked,

124
00:04:10,221 --> 00:04:13,190
we've had bear talk
earlier with Joe Bear Talk.

125
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:15,801
I got more questions,

126
00:04:15,801 --> 00:04:16,160
man.

127
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:16,940
Okay.

128
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:17,680
What kind of questions?

129
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,513
Well,

130
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,353
uh,

131
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:23,660
so you were telling us
that it's a a predator.

132
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:24,200
Yeah,

133
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:28,670
so it's in a different species of
reaction and sense of it's perceiving

134
00:04:28,671 --> 00:04:29,390
everything around it.

135
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:30,590
Bears are omnivores,

136
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:31,031
so they,

137
00:04:31,031 --> 00:04:31,581
they'll eat.

138
00:04:31,581 --> 00:04:36,080
Sometimes they'll ignore any like any
game because they find like a big patch of

139
00:04:36,081 --> 00:04:39,080
blueberries and Dell even ignore
meat that's being left out.

140
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:39,831
They don't care.

141
00:04:39,831 --> 00:04:42,260
They'll find a patch of blueberries
on a hill and they'll just,

142
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:43,123
they'll just go to that.

143
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,380
I dare of smells.

144
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:45,140
Incredible.

145
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:46,760
So they are super sensitive though.

146
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:47,250
Like if you,

147
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:47,871
if you're over there,

148
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:48,800
they know you're there.

149
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,670
Oh yeah.

150
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:53,390
They know you're there for sh like
unless you are really far away,

151
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:57,230
you could be like a hundred yards away
or 200 yards away with the right wind.

152
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:58,550
They might not know you're there.

153
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:01,400
But if they're near you
and there's no wind,

154
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,900
most likely they know you're there.

155
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:04,550
If the wind is blowing towards them,

156
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:05,720
they definitely know you're there.

157
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:06,740
They can just smell you.

158
00:05:06,741 --> 00:05:10,640
And their sense of smell
is way better than a dog.

159
00:05:10,641 --> 00:05:13,460
And a dog's sense of smell is
insanely better than a person's.

160
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:14,120
You know,

161
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:14,953
this is like the,

162
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,860
it's really hard for them to measure
like what animals have the best sense of

163
00:05:18,861 --> 00:05:19,191
smell.

164
00:05:19,191 --> 00:05:21,290
It's very difficult to
really kind of quantify it,

165
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:22,230
but what,

166
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:22,700
what,

167
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:27,230
what's even more difficult as us even
imagining like how good a dog's sense of

168
00:05:27,231 --> 00:05:28,064
smell is.

169
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,710
Cause it's a totally different
perception at that point.

170
00:05:30,711 --> 00:05:31,390
Right?

171
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:33,890
The smell like fear 48 totally.

172
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:34,610
Yeah.

173
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:35,443
And it's all,

174
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:38,060
it's like seeing an infrared
or something like that.

175
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:39,990
The world just opens up into components.

176
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,710
Is there like a fear of
pheromone that you emit,

177
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:43,760
I guess their mascot,

178
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:44,613
right?

179
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:45,990
It's weird

180
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:48,300
shit that you smell when you're
around people that you don't like,

181
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:49,413
you know,

182
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:52,980
or that people that freak you out or
people that might have bad intentions.

183
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,300
They have a weird smell,

184
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,320
you know?

185
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,153
Absolutely.

186
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:56,993
I have a nose like a,

187
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:58,340
yeah.

188
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:00,080
It's really weird to track bad guys.

189
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:01,093
I really can.

190
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:04,490
I swear to God so far this room is okay.

191
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:05,383
Oh sure.

192
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:07,460
Everybody's doing great.

193
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:09,230
Did you give gay Jamie a good sniff?

194
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:10,790
I didn't hear you smell great.

195
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:12,770
You passed the test?

196
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:14,601
Yeah,

197
00:06:14,601 --> 00:06:17,360
I couldn't imagine like
smelling everybody's farts.

198
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:18,260
Like in a city,

199
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:19,730
like if you're at a ball,

200
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,380
I'll give your a dog and you see a fart.

201
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:25,460
But if you're a dog you're eating shit.

202
00:06:25,461 --> 00:06:26,590
So your industry you don't want,

203
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:27,500
I don't mind at all.

204
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:29,150
They don't have any cultural context,

205
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:30,843
you know,

206
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:31,790
yet.

207
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:32,623
I think

208
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:36,050
faith they will evolve and we will see it.

209
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:38,250
What do you mean like look a jumpy,

210
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:38,701
jumpy,

211
00:06:38,701 --> 00:06:39,151
the dog.

212
00:06:39,151 --> 00:06:40,710
I mean he is way ahead of schedule.

213
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:42,150
Do you think dogs have today?

214
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:43,190
Look back at the dogs.

215
00:06:43,191 --> 00:06:44,810
I was like five from
years ago and goes what?

216
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,110
A bunch of fucking idiots

217
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,770
freaking out when they
heard the first siren.

218
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:51,810
Like they had their heroes.

219
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:53,220
You don't even know about.

220
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:54,090
Yeah,

221
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:54,830
I was like,

222
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:55,950
do you remember that one dog?

223
00:06:55,951 --> 00:06:56,970
The dog to save the guy,

224
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,950
the first one to bear the bone?

225
00:06:59,060 --> 00:06:59,260
Yeah.

226
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:01,740
My friend Steve or was telling
me that they used to do show

227
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:06,500
knows where they would take like a raft
filled with animals and they would push

228
00:07:06,501 --> 00:07:08,380
them off of the um,

229
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:09,741
the,

230
00:07:09,741 --> 00:07:09,911
the,

231
00:07:09,911 --> 00:07:12,530
the big waterfall a w
what does it mean Jaeger?

232
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:13,340
No false.

233
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:13,851
Jesus.

234
00:07:13,851 --> 00:07:14,481
They would tear,

235
00:07:14,481 --> 00:07:15,710
people would pay to watch it.

236
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:20,300
It was still on the sidelines and they
would push a raft of animals off Niagara

237
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,133
Falls to their death.

238
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,010
What?

239
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:22,700
Yeah.

240
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,290
It's like some early 1900 shit.

241
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:25,640
Why?

242
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,211
Because people,

243
00:07:26,211 --> 00:07:26,481
you know,

244
00:07:26,481 --> 00:07:28,400
it was a show like
people get see the show.

245
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:29,690
I think they would pay to see,

246
00:07:29,691 --> 00:07:33,950
so they would load this raft up with
exotic animals that were freaking out and

247
00:07:33,951 --> 00:07:38,300
trying to figure out how to get off the
raft and then send them over the top six

248
00:07:38,301 --> 00:07:38,930
sons of bitches.

249
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:39,470
Wow.

250
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:40,610
How weird.

251
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,390
Yeah.

252
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:42,920
Now does it sound an even entertaining,

253
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:44,360
depressed now?

254
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:45,470
Okay.

255
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:46,300
It's definitely not right.

256
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:46,720
Retaining,

257
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,920
it's definitely disgusting.

258
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:49,150
Definitely should be illegal.

259
00:07:49,151 --> 00:07:50,080
Definitely should be punished.

260
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:55,260
But if you were there while that
raft is headed towards the apex,

261
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:57,520
do you keep looking or do you go,

262
00:07:57,521 --> 00:07:57,960
I don't want to

263
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:58,380
part of this,

264
00:07:58,380 --> 00:07:59,670
that was like this too late

265
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:05,650
form of all the fucking Facebook shit
of like distracted by it was like,

266
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:09,580
let's just watch something
absolutely asinine or horrifying.

267
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,030
Yeah.

268
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:11,260
Because it's,

269
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:12,580
there's that shock factor,

270
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,030
right?

271
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:13,301
You know,

272
00:08:13,301 --> 00:08:17,530
but I feel like that's not too far off
from watching dog fighting even though

273
00:08:17,531 --> 00:08:19,360
there's gambling and betting involved,

274
00:08:19,361 --> 00:08:22,390
but like people that can
handle that kind of thing.

275
00:08:22,391 --> 00:08:23,440
I think there's just like,

276
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,300
I think there's some sort of,

277
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:26,950
I can't relate to this,

278
00:08:26,951 --> 00:08:28,810
but I think that there's
some sort of like innate,

279
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,033
um,

280
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:35,050
a primal instinct to want
to see something terrible.

281
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,190
So it's like more terrible than what you
can experience in your everyday life.

282
00:08:39,191 --> 00:08:40,810
Maybe feel better about it or something.

283
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:43,450
Or your people are just
sick and disgusting,

284
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:44,550
I think either warm.

285
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:44,781
Right.

286
00:08:44,781 --> 00:08:45,980
It doesn't have to be one of the other,

287
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:46,551
I mean,

288
00:08:46,551 --> 00:08:47,450
it could have been,

289
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:49,330
could be both or you should,

290
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:50,061
but that's for real.

291
00:08:50,061 --> 00:08:51,410
Like people actually really do that.

292
00:08:51,411 --> 00:08:51,590
Like,

293
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:52,211
that's not a joke.

294
00:08:52,211 --> 00:08:52,400
No,

295
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,070
it was real.

296
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:54,140
It was all like a show.

297
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:55,110
Oh my God.

298
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:56,010
People would pay to see it.

299
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:56,993
Yeah.

300
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,130
We were just talking about
this earlier actually.

301
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:00,781
What are you pulling in?

302
00:09:00,781 --> 00:09:01,860
We're just trying to find pictures of it.

303
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:02,753
Oh,

304
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:05,370
we were just talking
about this earlier about,

305
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:06,263
um,

306
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,201
being sensitive.

307
00:09:07,201 --> 00:09:09,330
And I was telling Joe that,

308
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,193
um,

309
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,001
there's some,

310
00:09:11,001 --> 00:09:11,230
yeah,

311
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:11,561
he goes,

312
00:09:11,561 --> 00:09:13,030
we're talking about being sensitive that

313
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:15,941
I brought the,

314
00:09:15,941 --> 00:09:17,880
I run the Feminine Energy Today.

315
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:18,700
God dammit.

316
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:19,533
She does.

317
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:23,860
And the way energy and the
killer of the feminine energy.

318
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,750
It's true.

319
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:26,500
Um,

320
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,070
but I,

321
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:27,461
you know,

322
00:09:27,461 --> 00:09:31,180
we were talking about
TV and there's certain,

323
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:32,950
whenever I'm witnessing,

324
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,830
whether it's in a TV show
or movie or real life,

325
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:41,550
some people really losing or people
just being absolutely terrible to one

326
00:09:42,341 --> 00:09:42,701
another,

327
00:09:42,701 --> 00:09:45,970
especially when someone is trying
their best and they just kicked,

328
00:09:45,971 --> 00:09:46,960
kicked when they're down.

329
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:47,770
Yeah.

330
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:49,090
Guts me that I just,

331
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:49,800
Oh,

332
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,750
can cause you're a genuinely nice person.

333
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,593
She was my soul.

334
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:55,050
You're a genuinely nice person
who would never do that.

335
00:09:55,051 --> 00:09:56,610
So you see it and it drives you crazy.

336
00:09:56,850 --> 00:10:00,870
One of the things that drives us crazy
is the horrible things that we hope we

337
00:10:00,871 --> 00:10:01,800
never seen ourselves.

338
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:02,590
You know,

339
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:04,170
like when we see
something really pathetic,

340
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:04,980
there's,

341
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:07,530
there's horrible or mean or vicious.

342
00:10:07,531 --> 00:10:11,880
There's part of us that like knows it's
evil and knows it's bad and people are

343
00:10:11,881 --> 00:10:16,330
being hurt and there that that part of
us without a doubt is angry or upset at

344
00:10:16,331 --> 00:10:17,550
the situation.

345
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:20,370
But there's also a part of us that
hopes that were never like that.

346
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:20,850
Yeah.

347
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:21,350
You know,

348
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:21,451
like,

349
00:10:21,451 --> 00:10:23,040
I think that's part of like what you see.

350
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:26,750
Even when you see like a murderer or we
see like someone whose life has gotten

351
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:30,000
totally out of control and off
the rails and into the woods,

352
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:31,680
you just go,

353
00:10:31,681 --> 00:10:32,011
God,

354
00:10:32,011 --> 00:10:32,880
could that have been me?

355
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:33,331
You know,

356
00:10:33,331 --> 00:10:35,220
like that's one of the things
that freaks you out the most.

357
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:35,581
Well,

358
00:10:35,581 --> 00:10:38,610
it opens up the spectrum
of what we're capable of.

359
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:42,870
You see some person who shows up at their
job and just started shooting people

360
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:43,621
and you go,

361
00:10:43,621 --> 00:10:45,270
what brought her to do that?

362
00:10:45,271 --> 00:10:45,630
What brought,

363
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:46,530
it's usually not a her,

364
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:47,580
I don't know why I said hurts.

365
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:49,890
Is it ever been her woman?

366
00:10:49,891 --> 00:10:50,670
Mass shooter?

367
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:51,900
That's a really good fucking question.

368
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:54,120
There was just maybe one or two.

369
00:10:54,121 --> 00:10:54,591
I was just read.

370
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:55,570
There was this Escobar.

371
00:10:55,580 --> 00:11:00,580
It's a very good question about how she's
trying to be like even it's not even

372
00:11:00,751 --> 00:11:01,110
at all.

373
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:01,290
Yeah.

374
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:03,570
There's an Esquire articles
that get any ideas out there.

375
00:11:03,571 --> 00:11:04,020
Ladies.

376
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:05,580
Let's just keep it cool.

377
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:06,210
Keep it,

378
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:07,950
cause everybody stay calm.

379
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:09,060
Um,

380
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:11,670
and it was really interesting because
half of the article was just like,

381
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:11,840
uh,

382
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:15,630
a history of maybe just the
last 10 years of mass shooting.

383
00:11:15,631 --> 00:11:19,770
There's been a ridiculous amount
of mass shootings are always mail.

384
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:20,850
It's in Time magazine,

385
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:24,900
except there's a big fucking stupid
pulldown menu that we can't get out of the

386
00:11:24,901 --> 00:11:25,530
way.

387
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:26,071
Where to go.

388
00:11:26,071 --> 00:11:27,450
How about you use Squarespace?

389
00:11:27,451 --> 00:11:27,930
You fucks.

390
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:28,763
Yeah.

391
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,430
Make yourself a really real cause that
has happened or are we just going to

392
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:35,960
add from earlier

393
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:38,363
Rhino Horn?

394
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:39,203
We didn't eat.

395
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:39,610
Okay.

396
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:41,220
Squarespace isn't even on today's ads.

397
00:11:41,221 --> 00:11:42,930
So stop talking.

398
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:43,883
Just stop.

399
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:44,641
On the other hand,

400
00:11:44,641 --> 00:11:45,780
make an excellent website.

401
00:11:45,781 --> 00:11:46,890
So I'm saying the other half have,

402
00:11:46,891 --> 00:11:50,250
the Esquire article was about
this dude who was foiled in his,

403
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:51,120
uh,

404
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,320
mass shooting attempt.

405
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,350
And he went to,

406
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:54,040
but they didn't,

407
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,720
it was like a frank abignail,

408
00:11:56,050 --> 00:12:01,050
you know how he was this world traveling
a counterfeiter and eventually they

409
00:12:01,301 --> 00:12:03,500
caught him and he started
working for the FBI.

410
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:04,300
I'm not aware of that.

411
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:04,740
Okay.

412
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:05,140
Is that,

413
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:06,780
catch me if you can movie oh,

414
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,633
DiCaprio.

415
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,740
That's about that guy.

416
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:09,491
That's about that dude.

417
00:12:09,491 --> 00:12:12,400
And this was a similar situation where
they found this mass shooter who didn't

418
00:12:12,401 --> 00:12:15,910
actually get to carry out his plan and
it started to use him to get into the

419
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:17,320
psyche of these dudes.

420
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,513
Oh.

421
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:21,220
And he talks about the process,

422
00:12:21,221 --> 00:12:21,590
like,

423
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:21,761
you know,

424
00:12:21,761 --> 00:12:23,050
it starts with isolation,

425
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:26,530
but the turning point was him
starting to feel like he was,

426
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:27,191
he,

427
00:12:27,191 --> 00:12:28,780
he realized he was better than everybody.

428
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,360
It was loneliness and
alienation and then like,

429
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:31,931
wait,

430
00:12:31,931 --> 00:12:34,750
but the reason is I'm the
best and they're the worst,

431
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:35,561
you know?

432
00:12:35,561 --> 00:12:36,520
And He created his plant.

433
00:12:36,521 --> 00:12:38,020
So all these guys

434
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:39,611
tell us,

435
00:12:39,611 --> 00:12:44,611
your serial killer is this your soul
every three hours for a mass shooter.

436
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:46,050
In waiting.

437
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:49,271
Are you ready to pop,

438
00:12:49,271 --> 00:12:49,810
Bro?

439
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:50,620
Come on.

440
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:51,453
Questions like that?

441
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:52,810
I can fucking find out.

442
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:54,250
Well,

443
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:58,180
mental illness is a terrifying thing
because I don't know what's going on in

444
00:12:58,181 --> 00:12:59,014
your brain.

445
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:00,460
I don't know what's
going on in your brain.

446
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:03,610
I can only guess based on all
the time we've hung out together,

447
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:05,050
that it's nothing scary.

448
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:06,751
You know what I mean?

449
00:13:06,751 --> 00:13:07,111
I'm telling you.

450
00:13:07,111 --> 00:13:08,520
Everybody smells good here.

451
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,170
I agree.

452
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:10,381
It's,

453
00:13:10,381 --> 00:13:10,841
it's okay.

454
00:13:10,841 --> 00:13:12,270
I don't smell any crazies are,

455
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:15,550
when in California postal shooting
had history of bizarre behavior.

456
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:16,960
How many did she shoot?

457
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:18,910
A six.

458
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:20,203
Do you guys,

459
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:21,790
do you know that the woman,

460
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,160
um,

461
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,550
who there was a woman's
secret service agent,

462
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:27,100
they've got overpowered by that
guy that ran into the White House.

463
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,180
The woman there was a woman's
secret service agent that
was on the first line of

464
00:13:31,181 --> 00:13:31,720
fire.

465
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,710
Like she was on the front line.

466
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,770
The guy got in and got ahold
of her and overpowered her.

467
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:37,383
That's no good.

468
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,340
That's terrifying.

469
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:38,830
You're blowing it.

470
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:39,670
Got To master.

471
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:41,710
He got past her like that.

472
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:42,873
Was that recently?

473
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:43,290
Yeah.

474
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:43,451
Yeah,

475
00:13:43,451 --> 00:13:43,781
a few days.

476
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:44,021
Okay.

477
00:13:44,021 --> 00:13:44,800
I know what you're talking about.

478
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,850
It's scary as shit,

479
00:13:45,851 --> 00:13:46,240
man.

480
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,080
This is scary shit.

481
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:47,710
Aye.

482
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:49,090
Well they just got outed for all this.

483
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:49,520
Yeah.

484
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:49,941
Stuff man.

485
00:13:49,941 --> 00:13:51,590
Did you hear about all the shots fired on?

486
00:13:51,591 --> 00:13:52,940
I can't remember what part of the West,

487
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:53,601
excuse me?

488
00:13:53,601 --> 00:13:54,140
The White House?

489
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:54,470
No,

490
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:56,750
they're like seven shots
fired into the White House.

491
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,090
The secret service didn't know
about it for a couple of days.

492
00:13:59,260 --> 00:13:59,780
What?

493
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:00,290
Yeah,

494
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:02,190
what was it like sniper fire or something?

495
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:02,360
Yeah,

496
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,193
someone just,

497
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:04,490
Oh God.

498
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:05,060
Yeah,

499
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:05,661
and that was the,

500
00:14:05,661 --> 00:14:06,494
it didn't the woman,

501
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,790
the woman who ran the city,

502
00:14:07,791 --> 00:14:08,630
she just resigned.

503
00:14:08,631 --> 00:14:09,590
I mean it's the whole fucking thing.

504
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:13,670
And then there was a one woman who got
shot who's outside in her car and she did

505
00:14:13,671 --> 00:14:14,570
something in her car.

506
00:14:14,571 --> 00:14:18,680
I remember he just shot her and
drove her car onto the lawn.

507
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:19,350
Is that what it was?

508
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:20,183
We there,

509
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:21,560
we were in DC.

510
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:22,371
We were,

511
00:14:22,371 --> 00:14:23,900
we were putting at the nine 30 club.

512
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:25,100
I've done that place.

513
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:25,371
Oh,

514
00:14:25,371 --> 00:14:26,230
this is great.

515
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:26,790
It's fine.

516
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:27,770
That's a great spot.

517
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,610
Called that size in the
country was awesome.

518
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:30,320
I got it.

519
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,330
We got to tell the story just
because it's so fucking good.

520
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:33,320
So we,

521
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:33,801
we like,

522
00:14:33,801 --> 00:14:34,460
um,

523
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:34,880
one of,

524
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,280
uh,

525
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:40,160
honey honey favorite live show activities
is putting spirit animals on our

526
00:14:40,161 --> 00:14:40,994
stage.

527
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:43,280
Preferably like birds of prey,

528
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:44,810
play guitar underneath your story.

529
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:45,670
What?

530
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:45,851
Ooh,

531
00:14:45,851 --> 00:14:46,381
I like it.

532
00:14:46,381 --> 00:14:46,741
I like it.

533
00:14:46,741 --> 00:14:47,150
I like it.

534
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:48,020
I'm going to get appropriate.

535
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,590
So we used to have this mascot who was a,

536
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:52,100
it was a rooster

537
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:54,080
is fucking great.

538
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:54,810
And we,

539
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:56,210
if we took this rooster everywhere,

540
00:14:56,211 --> 00:14:56,810
I got it.

541
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:58,850
It's on our Instagram page.

542
00:14:58,851 --> 00:15:01,010
I can show you because it's
really so much the rooster.

543
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:01,581
Yeah.

544
00:15:01,581 --> 00:15:02,414
And it was like,

545
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:04,600
it was rooster Sofie.

546
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:05,451
It's pretty average.

547
00:15:05,451 --> 00:15:06,284
Pretty accurate.

548
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:09,800
So how do I show this to you?

549
00:15:09,801 --> 00:15:10,820
I'm not really good at this stuff.

550
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,073
Anyway,

551
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:13,730
we get to the,

552
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:18,500
we get to the venue and the rooster gets
shattered by one of the employees by

553
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:19,334
accident.

554
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:20,850
And our,

555
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:22,250
our tour manager at the time,

556
00:15:22,251 --> 00:15:25,250
Sam Sam really had an
attachment to this rooster.

557
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:26,660
Like I'm upstairs,

558
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:29,000
we were downstairs and we just heard this

559
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:32,310
like three balconies.

560
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:38,030
But what's so great about nine 30 club
is that they're a really incredible team.

561
00:15:39,231 --> 00:15:40,300
Like the whole establishment,

562
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:41,630
like there's a real family vibe.

563
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:42,943
Um,

564
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:46,460
and the one of the employees incredible,

565
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:46,920
uh,

566
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:49,640
illustrative artists draws up a card,

567
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:51,023
um,

568
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:55,310
with his beautiful photo like drawing
of a rooster with a big tear coming down

569
00:15:55,311 --> 00:15:55,941
his face that says,

570
00:15:55,941 --> 00:15:57,140
sorry about your cock.

571
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:58,970
And the whole venue signed it,

572
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:02,270
all of the employees in the venue
sign it and we still have it.

573
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:05,000
And it was just one of
the coolest things ever.

574
00:16:05,001 --> 00:16:05,930
And you know,

575
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:06,250
it's,

576
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:06,970
it's,

577
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:08,570
that's actually a legendary venue.

578
00:16:08,571 --> 00:16:11,000
Like the people there are just phenomenal.

579
00:16:11,001 --> 00:16:14,300
The sound quality's is one of the best
sounding rooms with evergreen spot.

580
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:14,680
Yeah.

581
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,140
Yeah.

582
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,430
I did that place years ago.

583
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:17,780
That's a great spot.

584
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:18,653
That's awesome.

585
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:21,500
I'm going to DC soon
doing the Warner theater.

586
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:22,111
Ooh.

587
00:16:22,111 --> 00:16:22,820
Damn.

588
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:24,980
On the 18th of this month,

589
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:28,340
she's torn all the time now.

590
00:16:28,341 --> 00:16:29,180
What are you doing man?

591
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,860
I'm just telling jokes.

592
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:32,751
I just did my,

593
00:16:32,751 --> 00:16:35,540
a comedy central special
in Denver in November.

594
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:38,450
So what I'm doing right now
is I'm writing new jokes,

595
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:39,580
shit,

596
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:40,550
load of new jokes.

597
00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:42,363
How do you,

598
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:43,243
how do you approach that?

599
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:44,451
Um,

600
00:16:44,451 --> 00:16:45,170
you right.

601
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:48,260
And then you take those ideas
and you fuck with him onstage.

602
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,680
You really don't know what,

603
00:16:49,681 --> 00:16:50,900
like last night I did a punch,

604
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:51,561
a new shit.

605
00:16:51,561 --> 00:16:52,730
I didn't know where it was going,

606
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:53,421
you know,

607
00:16:53,421 --> 00:16:53,690
and,

608
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:56,930
but I kind of had ideas where it would
probably go and then there was some,

609
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:58,520
there's some things you,

610
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:02,150
you change when you're on the fly because
you kind of realize like on the fly

611
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:05,870
that it'd be better if I said it like
this or it'd be make more sense if I said

612
00:17:05,871 --> 00:17:06,320
it like that.

613
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:10,160
Or I could also say this and you know
you can under the pressure of like trying

614
00:17:10,161 --> 00:17:11,960
to forge the idea on stage,

615
00:17:11,961 --> 00:17:13,550
he come up with some fun lines,

616
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:15,800
bounce it off of anybody.

617
00:17:15,801 --> 00:17:16,020
Like,

618
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:16,500
no,

619
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,450
you just go for it.

620
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:19,430
I don't want to do that.

621
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:20,780
What do you iPhone it?

622
00:17:20,781 --> 00:17:22,640
You're just sitting in your
car and you come up with shit.

623
00:17:22,641 --> 00:17:23,110
Both.

624
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:24,320
I fall in it and I also,

625
00:17:24,321 --> 00:17:27,080
a lot of times I found
it into a print form.

626
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:28,220
I used to,

627
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,710
I used that thing that's note pad,

628
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:32,080
you know the nurse had you used the,

629
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:33,710
the little press a little microphone,

630
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:34,521
talk into it.

631
00:17:34,521 --> 00:17:35,420
It's unbelievable.

632
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:36,254
If you ever tried it,

633
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,690
but did you have a droid
the last time I saw?

634
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,021
Yeah,

635
00:17:39,021 --> 00:17:39,710
I got rid of it.

636
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:40,940
So he's switched that shit up.

637
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:41,241
No,

638
00:17:41,241 --> 00:17:42,061
but then I got a new one.

639
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:42,760
Yes.

640
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:43,593
Droid

641
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:46,810
phone pair to your phone.

642
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:47,883
But then I got it.

643
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,620
I got one of um,

644
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,220
galaxy

645
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:52,110
note fives or a galaxy.

646
00:17:52,111 --> 00:17:52,944
Um,

647
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:54,300
a galaxy s fives.

648
00:17:54,301 --> 00:17:55,140
I fucking love it.

649
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:56,603
It's great.

650
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:57,541
So can I ask,

651
00:17:57,541 --> 00:17:58,280
you are writing questions?

652
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:01,110
I don't get really know
how to check this out.

653
00:18:01,111 --> 00:18:03,750
Watch why put it talking to this honey.

654
00:18:03,751 --> 00:18:07,200
Honey ban is fucking bad ass sweet guy.

655
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:08,213
Watch this.

656
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,760
I love this positive reinforcement
on the honey band is fucking dude.

657
00:18:11,761 --> 00:18:12,860
She listens that amazing.

658
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:13,130
Listen,

659
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:14,940
I mean it just doesn't work like that.

660
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,170
It worked exactly.

661
00:18:16,171 --> 00:18:20,310
I mean it's got all the words and you
just talk into it and it prints it up.

662
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:22,930
And so I like doing that
when I'm driving cause of,

663
00:18:22,931 --> 00:18:27,210
I have an idea and like I could record
it and maybe that's the way to go.

664
00:18:27,211 --> 00:18:28,044
Sometimes

665
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:31,470
make us a sculpture.

666
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:32,580
It should be a sculpture.

667
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:37,640
I know what's going to be a dude with
his pants off and the fucking Texas belt

668
00:18:37,831 --> 00:18:38,350
buckle.

669
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:41,530
Did you know that the new Siri
now does Shizam so you could just,

670
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:42,070
uh,

671
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:42,810
do the that,

672
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:43,840
what song is this?

673
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:44,703
She never said,

674
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:48,000
oh Sierra

675
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,450
does that even come up with it?

676
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:53,440
He puts it in the front.

677
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:56,410
There's a lot of loans in your
pocket or a lot of room in the front.

678
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:57,573
My group,

679
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:58,750
no extra room.

680
00:18:58,790 --> 00:18:59,623
Never

681
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:02,470
once he get off that rule.

682
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,880
There's some shrinkage I had,

683
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,301
but I don't know.

684
00:19:07,301 --> 00:19:08,530
Sorry for being demanding.

685
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:09,980
This is your fucking place

686
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:14,400
demanding.

687
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:14,660
I like,

688
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:15,060
okay,

689
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:15,460
well see,

690
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:16,930
I don't know if this truly applies,

691
00:19:16,931 --> 00:19:18,550
but I feel like a lot of
people who write stuff,

692
00:19:18,551 --> 00:19:19,090
song,

693
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:19,451
comedy,

694
00:19:19,451 --> 00:19:20,100
whatever,

695
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,450
when you're young it
comes or maybe not young,

696
00:19:22,451 --> 00:19:23,860
there's a certain pain point,

697
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:24,181
like a,

698
00:19:24,181 --> 00:19:26,860
an initial point where it
comes very unconsciously,

699
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:28,000
you know,

700
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,770
just kind of flows out in a sense of like,

701
00:19:29,771 --> 00:19:29,981
okay,

702
00:19:29,981 --> 00:19:31,000
I'm just expressing myself.

703
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:34,930
And then later on down the road there's
this conscious element that you have to

704
00:19:34,931 --> 00:19:39,100
like retrain yourself to do something
consciously that you may be used to do

705
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:39,851
subconsciously.

706
00:19:39,851 --> 00:19:40,930
Am I presuming too much?

707
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:41,501
Well,

708
00:19:41,501 --> 00:19:42,200
I think

709
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,090
but he might be the exact opposite.

710
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:44,690
Interesting.

711
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:48,800
Because in comedy in the beginning you
suck so hard that you're terrified of

712
00:19:48,801 --> 00:19:50,720
every stupid fucking
word you're writing down.

713
00:19:50,721 --> 00:19:52,880
You have very little confidence
in anything that you're thinking,

714
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:57,110
but then as you get older you kind of
understand what you think is funny about

715
00:19:57,111 --> 00:19:58,130
something and you,

716
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:00,470
it also becomes like a different,

717
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,470
that's more of a conscious act though,

718
00:20:03,471 --> 00:20:04,304
right?

719
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:06,540
Not necessarily that it's
more of a conscious act.

720
00:20:06,541 --> 00:20:07,220
It's just put the you,

721
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:09,640
you understand what you're
trying to do now because when,

722
00:20:09,641 --> 00:20:10,670
when you're young,

723
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:13,670
what you're trying to do is
you're trying to kick ass,

724
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:16,610
like I'm going to get this joke and
then it's going to be so awesome.

725
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:18,290
It's like I was trying
to explain to a friend,

726
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:20,690
like if you made an album,

727
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,040
like if you guys decided to make an album,

728
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:22,401
like honey,

729
00:20:22,401 --> 00:20:25,610
honey is going to make an album and our
goal is to sell the most fucking records

730
00:20:25,611 --> 00:20:26,444
of all time.

731
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,860
So that's what we're going
to do with this album.

732
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:30,950
We're going to make the fucking album
that sells more fucking records.

733
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:33,470
We're going to make $1 million or billion,

734
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:36,530
million dollars because I want to fucking
yacht and I want a jet in a Bentley.

735
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:42,080
So if you approached writing your songs
and that's all you were thinking about,

736
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:44,390
it would fuck you up hard.

737
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:47,410
Like you would somehow or
another lose your shin.

738
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,100
That have to

739
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,840
happen to me when I was an actor.

740
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:50,713
What did you want?

741
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:53,980
Fucking money I want to do to survive.

742
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,030
And I worked for a little while
and I had like a good two years.

743
00:20:58,390 --> 00:20:59,530
And um,

744
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:03,310
it was like once I moved to La from,

745
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:06,640
I was living in New York and I
moved to La and I stopped working.

746
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,940
And then every time I went to an audition,

747
00:21:09,941 --> 00:21:11,050
I was just so desperate.

748
00:21:11,051 --> 00:21:13,000
Like I couldn't focus on what
was right in front of me.

749
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:14,170
I had to focus on what was,

750
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:17,620
what would happen if I got the job
instead of I think people can smell that.

751
00:21:17,621 --> 00:21:18,310
I'm not kidding.

752
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:19,000
Oh yeah.

753
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:19,640
It's totally,

754
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,350
definitely.

755
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:21,190
But also,

756
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:22,240
you know,

757
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:22,601
on a,

758
00:21:22,601 --> 00:21:23,530
as a side note,

759
00:21:23,531 --> 00:21:26,620
like that's why how I started
playing music cause I sort of got,

760
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:27,251
you know,

761
00:21:27,251 --> 00:21:28,300
thrown off course.

762
00:21:28,301 --> 00:21:29,740
I was totally lost and I,

763
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:30,581
I moved to La,

764
00:21:30,581 --> 00:21:32,590
I didn't have any friends when I got here.

765
00:21:32,591 --> 00:21:35,020
I had like a boyfriend
and we broke up and yeah,

766
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:35,873
Super Sad.

767
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:38,470
And then I wrote these terrible sad songs.

768
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,393
I know,

769
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:43,991
but it's true.

770
00:21:43,991 --> 00:21:45,790
Like you know that that end result,

771
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:46,720
it's totally,

772
00:21:46,721 --> 00:21:47,560
you're absolutely right.

773
00:21:47,561 --> 00:21:48,610
As far as like,

774
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:48,971
you know,

775
00:21:48,971 --> 00:21:49,960
creativity goes,

776
00:21:49,961 --> 00:21:50,181
it's kind,

777
00:21:50,181 --> 00:21:51,580
Kinda like not up to you too.

778
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:52,520
Yeah.

779
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,390
I think I like,

780
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:56,960
I really love being friends with guys
like you guys because I don't know

781
00:21:57,050 --> 00:21:58,340
anything about music.

782
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:02,030
So I get to appreciate it from this
like really innocent point of view.

783
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:02,450
Like,

784
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:02,631
Ooh,

785
00:22:02,631 --> 00:22:03,770
that sounds awesome.

786
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:05,780
Like I don't know anything about chords.

787
00:22:05,781 --> 00:22:07,280
I don't know how you do
shit with your voice.

788
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:08,720
I don't know anything about chords either.

789
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:12,890
And that's kind of what I'm talking
about it no in a sense of like,

790
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,890
so we get to this point and this
happens to a lot of people who go to

791
00:22:15,891 --> 00:22:18,860
conservatories are like
really study the shit does it?

792
00:22:18,861 --> 00:22:21,530
They have this technical understanding
all of a sudden and now they have to

793
00:22:21,531 --> 00:22:25,070
spend the rest of their career figuring
out how to forget about that stuff and

794
00:22:25,071 --> 00:22:26,960
just like how do I come at this?

795
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:31,010
Like you're talking about like someone
who doesn't really understand it coming

796
00:22:31,011 --> 00:22:33,740
from an emotional place and
you're actually using it
for what it's supposed to

797
00:22:33,741 --> 00:22:34,574
be used for.

798
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:34,761
Yeah.

799
00:22:34,761 --> 00:22:38,390
I think maybe it's just like
exercising too much focus on one area.

800
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:39,530
Like,

801
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:44,210
I think it's probably that like tactical
proficiency is probably very important

802
00:22:44,211 --> 00:22:45,044
in music,

803
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:50,030
but it's also like nurturing a
creative viewpoint where if you're,

804
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:50,990
if you're doing something,

805
00:22:50,991 --> 00:22:51,824
let's put it this way,

806
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:53,600
if you're doing something
and you're studying,

807
00:22:53,601 --> 00:22:56,030
this is not to knock studying
music and practicing,

808
00:22:56,031 --> 00:22:56,960
but if you're practicing,

809
00:22:56,961 --> 00:23:00,860
say a very particular song and you're
doing that song over and over and over

810
00:23:00,861 --> 00:23:01,071
again,

811
00:23:01,071 --> 00:23:03,680
like I'm sure you're gaining
technical proficiency,

812
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:08,630
but should there be like an equal amount
of time where you just explore making

813
00:23:08,631 --> 00:23:09,650
your own sounds,

814
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:10,551
making your own,

815
00:23:10,551 --> 00:23:13,340
using your own lyrics to
having your own thoughts?

816
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:17,060
Or should you do like the
classical music version of music,

817
00:23:17,061 --> 00:23:19,220
which is consistently performing Bach,

818
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:19,701
Bach,

819
00:23:19,701 --> 00:23:20,534
Beethoven,

820
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:23,690
like songs that have been
done there in the can it,

821
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:25,430
you're just recreating them.

822
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:27,080
I think it's a little bit of everything.

823
00:23:27,081 --> 00:23:27,920
Did you want to say something?

824
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:29,210
It is kind of a little bit of everything,

825
00:23:29,211 --> 00:23:29,550
right?

826
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:30,231
You beat me to,

827
00:23:30,231 --> 00:23:31,000
you got it.

828
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:31,590
The flow.

829
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:32,340
Okay.

830
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:32,611
Well,

831
00:23:32,611 --> 00:23:32,851
it's,

832
00:23:32,851 --> 00:23:33,181
it's,

833
00:23:33,181 --> 00:23:33,451
yeah,

834
00:23:33,451 --> 00:23:34,890
it is a little bit of everything because,

835
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:35,551
you know,

836
00:23:35,551 --> 00:23:38,580
obviously like there's muscle
memory when you're playing,

837
00:23:38,581 --> 00:23:39,780
so if you're in shape,

838
00:23:39,781 --> 00:23:40,890
it's just like working out,

839
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:41,650
you know,

840
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:41,920
I'll,

841
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:45,480
I'll do exercises of classical
music just to like what he do.

842
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:45,980
I have

843
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:46,820
my chops up.

844
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:47,660
Um,

845
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:48,500
I have to do for us.

846
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:49,461
Not a,

847
00:23:49,461 --> 00:23:50,070
no,

848
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:50,480
no,

849
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,120
no.

850
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:51,890
I'll do some.

851
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:52,640
I mean me,

852
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:52,710

853
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:53,543
my Lah la Lah.

854
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:54,320
Lah,

855
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:54,610
Lah,

856
00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:54,791
Lah,

857
00:23:54,791 --> 00:23:54,960
Lah,

858
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:55,793
Lah.

859
00:23:58,610 --> 00:23:59,540
Can You keep going?

860
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:01,383
Stretch.

861
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:03,320
Just move around a lot.

862
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:04,533
That's an impressive,

863
00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:08,280
just been working on this new piece.

864
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,250
Just a warm up piece.

865
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:10,010
Yeah,

866
00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:10,470
it's pretty,

867
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:10,891
it's cool.

868
00:24:10,891 --> 00:24:11,724
It's like a,

869
00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:14,020
it's got Keith Jarrett is very,

870
00:24:14,021 --> 00:24:14,320
um,

871
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,400
almost led Zepplin light.

872
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:21,780
I could hear like Robert Plant.

873
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:45,873
I feel it.

874
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:50,050
I feel it baby inside of me from
now I'm wearing big sunglasses,

875
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:50,943
wigs,

876
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:51,790
large hats.

877
00:24:51,791 --> 00:24:52,361
I want attention.

878
00:24:52,361 --> 00:24:54,270
We want to be able to see
your teeth or your pants.

879
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:57,850
You could see my addiction
whether you want to or not.

880
00:24:58,410 --> 00:24:59,840
There are no pants big enough.

881
00:24:59,841 --> 00:25:00,551
It's angry.

882
00:25:00,551 --> 00:25:01,384
It's hard to,

883
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:02,470
it's on the move.

884
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:04,220
Constantly.

885
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:08,640
Constantly presents or
boundaries of cloth to clean.

886
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,513
Dick

887
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:11,540
fucking honeybadger on.

888
00:25:11,541 --> 00:25:12,870
My parents were mad.

889
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:13,713
Dick Rogan.

890
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:16,210
Rogan isn't even that big.

891
00:25:16,211 --> 00:25:17,044
It's just crazy

892
00:25:20,610 --> 00:25:21,443
thinking about it.

893
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:25,090
If you had like a fucking drunk
kangaroo or a wild vicious rat,

894
00:25:25,091 --> 00:25:26,110
I'd be more scared of the rat.

895
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:26,381
You know,

896
00:25:26,381 --> 00:25:26,981
with Kangaroos,

897
00:25:26,981 --> 00:25:27,791
like wobbling.

898
00:25:27,791 --> 00:25:28,720
Didn't live explosive.

899
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:29,560
Well,

900
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:32,500
you could get the plague from a rat rat.

901
00:25:32,501 --> 00:25:33,460
Scare the fuck out of me.

902
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:35,260
We've talked about on the podcast before,

903
00:25:35,261 --> 00:25:37,180
I had a bad situation with a rat,

904
00:25:37,181 --> 00:25:37,451
wants it,

905
00:25:37,451 --> 00:25:38,680
a pool hall in New Jersey.

906
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:42,190
Me and my friend John went to this place
to play pool and there's this fucking

907
00:25:42,191 --> 00:25:43,370
huge rap.

908
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:44,350
I'll never forget,

909
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:49,560
just big giant fucking crazy yellow teeth
and scare the shit out of me is like

910
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:52,180
getting bitten by the rat.

911
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:53,980
I have a great rat story.

912
00:25:55,090 --> 00:25:55,923
This is a good one.

913
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:01,093
She's not as,

914
00:26:03,490 --> 00:26:05,350
I like oil.

915
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:06,330
It's pretty dark.

916
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:08,050
So let me,

917
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,840
let me paint this with my tone.

918
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:11,500
Dark,

919
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:12,333
dark,

920
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:13,100
dark.

921
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:16,690
So I used to work in retail and the story.

922
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:17,440
Yeah,

923
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,273
let's call it.

924
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,620
That's actually really loud.

925
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:24,500
Okay,

926
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:24,951
I'll stop.

927
00:26:24,951 --> 00:26:25,784
I'm sorry.

928
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:31,960
So I was working in retail
and it was a horrible job.

929
00:26:31,961 --> 00:26:36,850
It was like totally degrading as a human
and all you would do is fold clothes

930
00:26:36,851 --> 00:26:37,310
all day.

931
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:41,140
It was really expensive and these people
would come in and spend ridiculous

932
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:44,010
amounts of money on clothes and
they were just shitty and mean

933
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:45,210
and rude and rich,

934
00:26:45,211 --> 00:26:45,960
whatever.

935
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,340
Not that that all constitutes,

936
00:26:47,341 --> 00:26:47,710
but it,

937
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:49,680
it was just an unpleasant experience.

938
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:54,160
And from whether it was a
customer or the staff that,

939
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:54,601
you know,

940
00:26:54,601 --> 00:26:57,810
my employers were just not kind and
they didn't give a shit about you.

941
00:26:58,230 --> 00:26:59,970
So I was already,

942
00:26:59,971 --> 00:27:04,320
I knew I was kind of walking on thin
ice because I wasn't like enthusiastic

943
00:27:04,321 --> 00:27:04,891
about being there.

944
00:27:04,891 --> 00:27:05,724
It was just a job.

945
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:07,320
And um,

946
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:12,350
one day before the biggest sale of the
year where people like late ladies freak

947
00:27:12,961 --> 00:27:13,794
out,

948
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:17,190
I came into the store and that
weekend there had been like,

949
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:21,090
there had been indications and evidence
that there were rodents because,

950
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:21,881
and I,

951
00:27:21,881 --> 00:27:22,351
and you know what?

952
00:27:22,351 --> 00:27:24,360
I knew it were rats
cause I could smell them.

953
00:27:24,361 --> 00:27:24,901
I swear to God.

954
00:27:24,901 --> 00:27:25,440
I was like,

955
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,190
I could smell.

956
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:27,720
Literally when someone
says I can smell a rat,

957
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:29,370
there's a musty smell to them,

958
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:30,930
you can fucking smell them.

959
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:31,853
I never saw,

960
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:32,131
oh,

961
00:27:32,131 --> 00:27:32,791
it's totally,

962
00:27:32,791 --> 00:27:34,380
cause my first house in La,

963
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,510
I moved into off of a craigslist ad,

964
00:27:36,511 --> 00:27:38,900
had rats and I knew I was
like that smell light.

965
00:27:38,901 --> 00:27:39,750
I know that smell.

966
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,160
That was from my old house.

967
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:42,023
That's a rat.

968
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:44,520
So long story short,

969
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,320
um,

970
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,660
the exterminators come in and
set traps the night before.

971
00:27:48,661 --> 00:27:51,510
So Saturday morning when
like this big sale starts,

972
00:27:51,810 --> 00:27:52,081
every,

973
00:27:52,081 --> 00:27:52,771
all the girls were like,

974
00:27:52,771 --> 00:27:53,440
oh my God,

975
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,360
you think they call it something?

976
00:27:54,361 --> 00:27:55,194
I Dunno.

977
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:58,920
We walk into the store and there's like,

978
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:00,480
there's one dead rat upstairs,

979
00:28:00,481 --> 00:28:03,570
there's one in the traps downstairs
and the other one downstairs.

980
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:05,430
And then there was another,

981
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:10,520
there was a trap that had been deployed
and there was a piece of a big large

982
00:28:11,551 --> 00:28:14,490
piece of a tail and blood.

983
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,530
I'm talking blood all over the clothes,

984
00:28:16,531 --> 00:28:17,640
all over the wall,

985
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:18,833
but no rat.

986
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:23,610
And one of the girls had
walked into the front of the,

987
00:28:23,611 --> 00:28:24,390
of the store.

988
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:28,140
And also you should know there was a line
forming outside of people that wanted

989
00:28:28,141 --> 00:28:30,360
to get in to get this
end of the year sale.

990
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:33,000
One of the girls walks in,

991
00:28:33,001 --> 00:28:33,270
she goes,

992
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:33,421
oh,

993
00:28:33,421 --> 00:28:34,254
with that,

994
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:38,820
and it was the size of a cat and it was
the rat that got that got out of the

995
00:28:38,821 --> 00:28:43,050
trap that like lost its tail was in
the middle of the store bleeding.

996
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:44,730
And it was like this big,

997
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,080
everybody's freaking out.

998
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:49,020
One of the girls was ballsy
enough to throw trash can over it.

999
00:28:49,021 --> 00:28:49,854
So it's like,

1000
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:50,251
you know,

1001
00:28:50,251 --> 00:28:52,720
it's like screaming in this and so,

1002
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:54,270
so at this point,

1003
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,051
at this point,

1004
00:28:55,051 --> 00:28:55,890
it's time.

1005
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,730
It is time to,

1006
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,270
to open the store and all that.

1007
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:01,500
People are knocking on the
window and we were able to,

1008
00:29:01,501 --> 00:29:01,980
like,

1009
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:05,160
we were able to sort of create a
diversion and put some clothes,

1010
00:29:05,161 --> 00:29:10,161
racks so you couldn't see the trashcan
people in while they were [inaudible] the

1011
00:29:10,591 --> 00:29:11,040
window.

1012
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:11,873
Nobody was letting,

1013
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:13,081
this was like a,

1014
00:29:13,081 --> 00:29:17,310
it was screaming like you couldn't
no one [inaudible] so we call the

1015
00:29:17,311 --> 00:29:18,144
exterminator.

1016
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:19,320
Oh,

1017
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,160
it gets so much better.

1018
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:21,750
The exterminator comes back.

1019
00:29:21,751 --> 00:29:22,170
We're like,

1020
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:22,441
dude,

1021
00:29:22,441 --> 00:29:24,180
there's a fucking live rad in the store.

1022
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:25,530
We can't open the doors.

1023
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,311
We have a sale.

1024
00:29:26,311 --> 00:29:27,240
There's a line around the block,

1025
00:29:27,241 --> 00:29:27,450
like,

1026
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:28,140
you know the owner,

1027
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:29,030
everybody's on the phone,

1028
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,450
everybody's freaking out,

1029
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:32,340
exterminator shows up.

1030
00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:35,670
And he walks in and he's like,

1031
00:29:35,671 --> 00:29:36,061
oh yeah,

1032
00:29:36,061 --> 00:29:36,370
that's a,

1033
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:37,141
that's a problem.

1034
00:29:37,141 --> 00:29:37,501
And he's like,

1035
00:29:37,501 --> 00:29:38,970
well I don't know my pellet gun.

1036
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:43,630
So in the next thing I know he walks out
to his truck and he comes back with a

1037
00:29:43,631 --> 00:29:45,630
two by four and he's like,

1038
00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:47,470
like you ladies might want to step back,

1039
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:52,260
kicks the trashcan open
and just fucking splat.

1040
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:57,330
Like he was in the mid [inaudible] fucking
blow up of watermelon in the middle

1041
00:30:01,901 --> 00:30:02,460
of the store.

1042
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:03,020
So,

1043
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:03,521
so then,

1044
00:30:03,521 --> 00:30:03,671
oh,

1045
00:30:03,671 --> 00:30:04,504
it gets so much better.

1046
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:10,330
So after he kills the rat and it's like
guts and end trails are all over the

1047
00:30:10,331 --> 00:30:11,140
place.

1048
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:12,340
The Mat store managers like,

1049
00:30:12,341 --> 00:30:12,611
ladies,

1050
00:30:12,611 --> 00:30:13,990
we need to clean this
up and open the store.

1051
00:30:13,991 --> 00:30:14,321
I was like,

1052
00:30:14,321 --> 00:30:15,850
are you fucking serious?

1053
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:20,260
So like buckets of bleach and
whatever clothing has the blood on it.

1054
00:30:20,261 --> 00:30:20,891
Just take it out,

1055
00:30:20,891 --> 00:30:21,061
we'll,

1056
00:30:21,061 --> 00:30:21,340
we'll,

1057
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:21,670
you know,

1058
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:22,960
we'll cancel it out later.

1059
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:24,550
So we're cleaning,

1060
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:28,000
we're running around
and I'm not kidding you.

1061
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:31,450
The door's open five minutes.

1062
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:35,140
And the manager who is my age
calls me upstairs and she's like,

1063
00:30:35,141 --> 00:30:35,974
Suzanne,

1064
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:36,873
can I have a word with you?

1065
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:37,841
And I'm like,

1066
00:30:37,841 --> 00:30:37,941
yeah,

1067
00:30:37,941 --> 00:30:38,111
yeah,

1068
00:30:38,111 --> 00:30:38,321
sure.

1069
00:30:38,321 --> 00:30:38,690
Whatever.

1070
00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:39,523
Go upstairs.

1071
00:30:40,570 --> 00:30:41,800
I get fucking fired.

1072
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:43,420
She was like,

1073
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:43,691
look,

1074
00:30:43,691 --> 00:30:43,961
you know,

1075
00:30:43,961 --> 00:30:45,580
we've been wanting to talk to you about,

1076
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:45,941
you know,

1077
00:30:45,941 --> 00:30:47,020
your performance here.

1078
00:30:47,021 --> 00:30:47,260
And like,

1079
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:47,591
I don't feel,

1080
00:30:47,591 --> 00:30:49,060
I know that you want to be a musician.

1081
00:30:49,061 --> 00:30:49,691
Just want to be.

1082
00:30:49,691 --> 00:30:50,130
And I was like,

1083
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:50,963
fuck it.

1084
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:52,740
Goddamn it.

1085
00:30:53,170 --> 00:30:54,003
But anyway,

1086
00:30:54,130 --> 00:30:54,963
I was like,

1087
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:58,750
you couldn't fire me before he
made me clean up the rats blood.

1088
00:30:58,751 --> 00:30:59,890
I had to clean up the blood.

1089
00:31:00,090 --> 00:31:00,351
Ben,

1090
00:31:00,351 --> 00:31:01,184
get fired.

1091
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:03,000
Are you fucking kidding me?

1092
00:31:03,001 --> 00:31:04,800
Like it was one of those
moments where I literally,

1093
00:31:04,801 --> 00:31:06,750
I lost my shit and then she was like,

1094
00:31:06,751 --> 00:31:06,871
well,

1095
00:31:06,871 --> 00:31:08,730
you can stay for the rest
of the day if you want.

1096
00:31:08,731 --> 00:31:09,260
I was like,

1097
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:11,310
you think I want to stay
here and look at you.

1098
00:31:11,311 --> 00:31:12,260
I hate you.

1099
00:31:12,261 --> 00:31:12,960
You know,

1100
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:13,800
horrible.

1101
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:15,570
But it's such a good story.

1102
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,920
So going through it was
all worth it at the time.

1103
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:22,761
Well it was just,

1104
00:31:22,761 --> 00:31:23,600
I'd never like,

1105
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:25,820
I'd never experienced like any,

1106
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:28,250
it's such a fantastical story.

1107
00:31:28,910 --> 00:31:29,743
Fantastical.

1108
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:30,793
It's crazy.

1109
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:35,270
Isn't it funny how story that is
absolutely horrible at the time becomes

1110
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:36,200
awesome.

1111
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:36,561
Oh yeah,

1112
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:37,394
it was,

1113
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:38,530
it was a low point.

1114
00:31:38,531 --> 00:31:40,380
It was a low point though
cause it was so insane.

1115
00:31:40,430 --> 00:31:44,510
Like when someone in in like dig
like just degrades you like that.

1116
00:31:44,511 --> 00:31:45,231
Like she said,

1117
00:31:45,231 --> 00:31:47,840
I know you're trying to be a musician
but like your heart's on in it.

1118
00:31:47,841 --> 00:31:48,201
And I was like,

1119
00:31:48,201 --> 00:31:50,020
of course I don't want to

1120
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:52,663
cleaning up.

1121
00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:54,743
You're right.

1122
00:32:01,570 --> 00:32:06,570
I was explaining this to me this
weekend about struggle and it's a very

1123
00:32:07,581 --> 00:32:08,330
important,

1124
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:09,170
interesting point.

1125
00:32:09,410 --> 00:32:10,730
And he was talking about working,

1126
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:12,440
struggling really hard,

1127
00:32:12,441 --> 00:32:13,760
doing something that sucks.

1128
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,440
It's not fun at the time,

1129
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:18,740
but it's fun later on for a long time.

1130
00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:21,140
Whereas something that comes really easy,

1131
00:32:21,141 --> 00:32:21,891
like fun,

1132
00:32:21,891 --> 00:32:25,400
like rollercoaster riding
is fun at the time,

1133
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:29,030
but after it's over has no
fun attached to it anymore.

1134
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:29,421
I was like,

1135
00:32:29,421 --> 00:32:29,961
whoa.

1136
00:32:29,961 --> 00:32:30,980
That is crazy.

1137
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:32,630
Because if you think about it that way,

1138
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:35,120
there's fun stored up.

1139
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:38,240
Yeah.

1140
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,140
But even if you have,

1141
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:40,320
it's still 30 seconds.

1142
00:32:40,321 --> 00:32:40,731
It's woo,

1143
00:32:40,731 --> 00:32:41,600
we did it was crazy.

1144
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:42,950
And then you kind of tell it,

1145
00:32:42,951 --> 00:32:47,930
but you just told the fucking harrowing
story of a rat trapped under the

1146
00:32:47,931 --> 00:32:51,980
trashcan shrieking why a bunch of chicks
are banging on the window and trying to

1147
00:32:51,981 --> 00:32:56,290
save some money and it's just fucking
Rad and the guy comes in and smashed.

1148
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:59,900
It is a great fucking story that
at the time he must have been like,

1149
00:32:59,901 --> 00:33:03,350
fuck this job and you fucking
fire me fucking of that day.

1150
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:04,580
Like immediately afterwards,

1151
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,890
look how great it is now.

1152
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:07,720
It's like there's been,

1153
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:12,720
there was like energy stored up in that
moment that's come through in a big way.

1154
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:19,490
We missing amazing crazy like acts
of nature like that in any respect.

1155
00:33:19,491 --> 00:33:21,800
I'm sure you've seen crazy
things out in the wilderness,

1156
00:33:21,801 --> 00:33:22,041
you know?

1157
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:22,550
It's just like,

1158
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:23,420
oh my God.

1159
00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:27,410
Well I've been talking about this the
last few days I've been really happy.

1160
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:28,090
Like about,

1161
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:29,060
I'm always pretty happy,

1162
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:34,180
but it's really fucking happy because
I'm not in the fucking rain forest in

1163
00:33:35,061 --> 00:33:40,061
Prince Edwards Island in Alaska was
sleeping in a wet tent and I'm like,

1164
00:33:40,611 --> 00:33:40,851
dude,

1165
00:33:40,851 --> 00:33:41,960
houses are awesome.

1166
00:33:41,961 --> 00:33:42,650
Plumbing,

1167
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:43,483
electricity,

1168
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:45,930
everything was wearing.

1169
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:47,630
My sleeping bag was wet,

1170
00:33:47,631 --> 00:33:48,464
my clothes are wet.

1171
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:49,760
I turned my light on.

1172
00:33:49,761 --> 00:33:52,550
I had a miner's light on when those
little things you put on like a little

1173
00:33:52,551 --> 00:33:54,830
headband sits over the forehead,

1174
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:55,693
like a third eye,

1175
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:56,953
your enlightenment.

1176
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,210
I turned this thing on in my,

1177
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:03,630
in my tent and I just saw
like it was raining do drops.

1178
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:07,250
It's like literally everywhere
you looked like the entire air,

1179
00:34:07,251 --> 00:34:09,170
all the air was filled with moisture.

1180
00:34:09,410 --> 00:34:12,080
There's nothing stays dry if possible.

1181
00:34:12,290 --> 00:34:14,510
We just hate like freeze dried foods.

1182
00:34:14,511 --> 00:34:15,051
You take walk.

1183
00:34:15,051 --> 00:34:16,510
We was drinking right out of the leg.

1184
00:34:16,910 --> 00:34:17,743
Five days,

1185
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:19,310
we're drinking right out of the lake.

1186
00:34:19,370 --> 00:34:20,500
You just dip your,

1187
00:34:22,130 --> 00:34:24,620
there's no Giardia because
there's no beavers up that high,

1188
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:25,713
and not only that,

1189
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:26,021
it's,

1190
00:34:26,021 --> 00:34:28,340
it's a lake that's made
entirely rainwater.

1191
00:34:28,341 --> 00:34:29,960
It's not fed by a river or anything.

1192
00:34:30,050 --> 00:34:30,541
What did he say?

1193
00:34:30,541 --> 00:34:31,790
It rains so much.

1194
00:34:31,791 --> 00:34:33,020
It's just pure rainwater

1195
00:34:34,970 --> 00:34:35,803
tributaries,

1196
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:36,950
nothing.

1197
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:38,990
It's 160 inches of rain a year.

1198
00:34:38,991 --> 00:34:40,580
It's the rainiest spot in North America.

1199
00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:41,810
She just dip your cleaning.

1200
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:43,363
Huge.

1201
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,480
Oh my God.

1202
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:45,740
I'll show you some pictures after the,

1203
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:47,140
after the podcast sober.

1204
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:48,290
This is amazing.

1205
00:34:48,650 --> 00:34:49,550
It's so humbling,

1206
00:34:49,551 --> 00:34:51,260
but beautiful.

1207
00:34:51,261 --> 00:34:52,160
Amazing.

1208
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:52,640
You know,

1209
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:54,650
solitary like really wild.

1210
00:34:54,651 --> 00:34:56,570
But when you get back home you feel great.

1211
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:57,200
It's like,

1212
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,580
I think that's the balance.

1213
00:34:58,790 --> 00:35:01,010
I don't think the balance
is living by herself.

1214
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,050
I don't think the balance
is going off Ted Kaczynski.

1215
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:05,930
I think the balance is
going out to nature.

1216
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,380
I'm going out on the limb,

1217
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:14,840
but I think the balance is going out
into nature and being around people.

1218
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:15,610
It's like both.

1219
00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:16,250
Definitely.

1220
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:17,510
It's like both like a nice

1221
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:20,601
exchange.

1222
00:35:20,601 --> 00:35:21,171
That energy,

1223
00:35:21,171 --> 00:35:24,010
whether it's like physical
contact or just you know,

1224
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:27,710
attention perspective
and be seeing the stars.

1225
00:35:27,711 --> 00:35:28,371
That's a huge,

1226
00:35:28,371 --> 00:35:29,000
huge,

1227
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:29,290
you know,

1228
00:35:29,290 --> 00:35:29,870
we,

1229
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:30,230
we,

1230
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:34,700
we just got to go to Hawaii
fairly recently and you
look up at the stars and you

1231
00:35:34,701 --> 00:35:35,900
see the Keck observatory.

1232
00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:36,611
No,

1233
00:35:36,611 --> 00:35:36,960
he did.

1234
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:37,830
He got to go

1235
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:39,180
your life.

1236
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:40,020
It's in Hawaii.

1237
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:40,920
It's on the big island.

1238
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:41,290
Oh,

1239
00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:41,911
that's where we were.

1240
00:35:41,911 --> 00:35:42,640
Shit too.

1241
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,260
Maybe we'll go back.

1242
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:43,650
You got,

1243
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:45,180
I'm scheduling my next trip.

1244
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:48,480
I'm going to make sure if I go there
that I go there when and when there's no

1245
00:35:48,481 --> 00:35:51,180
moon out because the last time
I went it was fucking amazing.

1246
00:35:51,181 --> 00:35:53,520
But the moon was out so you
don't see anything but the moon.

1247
00:35:53,521 --> 00:35:54,354
A few stars.

1248
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,100
But the time before I went,

1249
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:57,630
it was all stars.

1250
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:59,340
It was Warren Moon and it's insane.

1251
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:00,540
You can't believe,

1252
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:03,000
you almost get angry that
you can't see that every day.

1253
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:05,520
Everybody should see
it on a regular basis.

1254
00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:06,840
If you get to do it every night,

1255
00:36:06,841 --> 00:36:08,400
it should happen regular,

1256
00:36:08,401 --> 00:36:08,851
weekly,

1257
00:36:08,851 --> 00:36:09,181
monthly,

1258
00:36:09,181 --> 00:36:09,630
whatever.

1259
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:13,600
Cause it just sets you back to the point
of understanding what is actually going

1260
00:36:13,601 --> 00:36:13,671
on,

1261
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:14,330
where you are.

1262
00:36:14,330 --> 00:36:14,610
Yeah.

1263
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:15,031
You know what I mean?

1264
00:36:15,031 --> 00:36:15,390
Yeah.

1265
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:15,541
Yeah.

1266
00:36:15,541 --> 00:36:15,961
I think we're,

1267
00:36:15,961 --> 00:36:16,794
we're blocked off.

1268
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:19,140
We're in a car with like
super tinted windows.

1269
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:20,581
We look so cool.

1270
00:36:20,581 --> 00:36:21,414
You can't see,

1271
00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:23,080
we're obviously success dark out.

1272
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:23,973
We can't see shit

1273
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:27,690
obviously successful or being abducted.

1274
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:28,863
It's one or the other.

1275
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:32,730
You've maybe porn being filled one
of the biggest one or the other.

1276
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:38,800
But when we're flying around through
the galaxy and we don't realize it,

1277
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:39,730
we can get cocky,

1278
00:36:40,210 --> 00:36:41,020
but when you're standing,

1279
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:44,710
you're standing on the Keck observatory
and looking up and you see the very

1280
00:36:44,711 --> 00:36:46,960
defined Milky Way Galaxy.

1281
00:36:47,290 --> 00:36:48,190
It's so,

1282
00:36:48,370 --> 00:36:49,031
it's so crazy.

1283
00:36:49,031 --> 00:36:50,050
It's like you're,

1284
00:36:50,051 --> 00:36:55,051
you are literally on some sort of a
spaceship flying with no roof and you're

1285
00:36:55,511 --> 00:36:58,210
flying through the galaxy and
that's what it feels like.

1286
00:36:58,420 --> 00:36:58,721
It's,

1287
00:36:58,721 --> 00:36:59,560
it's everything is,

1288
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:00,970
you just feel so small.

1289
00:37:00,971 --> 00:37:01,151
It's like,

1290
00:37:01,151 --> 00:37:01,361
wow,

1291
00:37:01,361 --> 00:37:04,550
this is fucking huge
feeling of small though.

1292
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:05,320
Yes.

1293
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:07,510
Because it's not really
that you feel small.

1294
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:10,240
It's that you realize the enormity of it.

1295
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:11,373
Yeah.

1296
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,273
Everything,

1297
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:13,450
the whole package.

1298
00:37:13,451 --> 00:37:13,721
It's like,

1299
00:37:13,721 --> 00:37:14,830
not even that you feel small.

1300
00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:15,611
It's just like,

1301
00:37:15,611 --> 00:37:19,180
it's humbling and I think that's one of
the reasons why people are so God damn

1302
00:37:19,181 --> 00:37:19,900
cocky.

1303
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:20,970
I think we fucked up.

1304
00:37:20,971 --> 00:37:23,170
I'm making like lights
everywhere at night.

1305
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:25,380
No,

1306
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:26,340
I think it's what he said.

1307
00:37:26,341 --> 00:37:27,121
It's a balance.

1308
00:37:27,121 --> 00:37:27,421
It's like,

1309
00:37:27,421 --> 00:37:27,750
yeah,

1310
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:29,400
people need to remember to get away,

1311
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:30,421
you know,

1312
00:37:30,421 --> 00:37:32,220
and reflect and be out shut.

1313
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,210
Shut it down.

1314
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:34,290
Turn your fucking phone off.

1315
00:37:34,291 --> 00:37:34,561
Don't,

1316
00:37:34,561 --> 00:37:35,970
don't look at your Facebook page.

1317
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:36,300
Right.

1318
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:37,830
Go be outside,

1319
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:38,790
just take it in.

1320
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,110
I kind of felt like that when I,

1321
00:37:40,350 --> 00:37:41,760
I spent a summer surfing.

1322
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:43,230
I'm not a good surfer,

1323
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:43,801
but,

1324
00:37:43,801 --> 00:37:44,370
um,

1325
00:37:44,370 --> 00:37:44,620
I,

1326
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:46,170
I used to live by the beach and I,

1327
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:49,320
I diligently would go with a friend of
mine who was teaching me how to surf.

1328
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:50,040
And,

1329
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:50,873
um,

1330
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:51,950
I,

1331
00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:53,280
I had so many moments where like,

1332
00:37:53,281 --> 00:37:55,440
I was getting tossed around and you know,

1333
00:37:55,441 --> 00:37:56,140
where I,

1334
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:56,973
I was scared.

1335
00:37:57,450 --> 00:37:59,580
And you just feel like this is,

1336
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:00,750
this is the ocean,

1337
00:38:00,810 --> 00:38:01,410
this is,

1338
00:38:01,410 --> 00:38:02,520
this is huge.

1339
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:04,680
This is so much bigger than,

1340
00:38:05,010 --> 00:38:05,670
than me.

1341
00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:06,091
You know,

1342
00:38:06,091 --> 00:38:06,411
and I,

1343
00:38:06,411 --> 00:38:07,920
I had so much respect for,

1344
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:09,053
you know,

1345
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:10,440
great mother nature.

1346
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:11,370
It's a model I did,

1347
00:38:11,371 --> 00:38:11,970
but it did.

1348
00:38:11,970 --> 00:38:12,691
I really did.

1349
00:38:12,691 --> 00:38:12,841
Like,

1350
00:38:12,841 --> 00:38:14,100
I would have these moments
where I would just,

1351
00:38:14,310 --> 00:38:17,430
I would get up at like six in the morning
with my friend and go surfing and then

1352
00:38:17,431 --> 00:38:21,240
have this just awareness for the rest
of my day and it's pretty fucking cool.

1353
00:38:21,270 --> 00:38:23,040
I would imagine that the people that,

1354
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:24,083
that surf,

1355
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:24,840
you know,

1356
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,370
frequently that that's their hobby,

1357
00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:27,030
have it,

1358
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:30,330
have a real essence about them.

1359
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:32,690
This is definitely a spiritual connection.

1360
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:33,170
Toad.

1361
00:38:33,170 --> 00:38:36,220
It was a little lime energy
that's so much more powerful

1362
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:37,870
than you when you were riding that wave.

1363
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:41,080
It was just people that just
go to the beach every day,

1364
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:41,610
you know,

1365
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:43,390
or I'll all the time like this.

1366
00:38:43,391 --> 00:38:47,140
One of the reasons my beach towns are
so chill isn't something about the salt

1367
00:38:47,470 --> 00:38:49,930
like alkalizing or something good for you.

1368
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:51,520
It's very cleansing.

1369
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:55,090
I would imagine like if you go by like
Santa Monica and you watched the waves,

1370
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:55,781
like you'll,

1371
00:38:55,781 --> 00:38:57,030
he see the mist it,

1372
00:38:57,031 --> 00:39:00,080
you'd see the met like people are
breathing that and the air's clean.

1373
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:01,380
This shit we wouldn't hear.

1374
00:39:01,381 --> 00:39:04,060
This is a fucking hundred million cars
and the air's clean there cause it's all

1375
00:39:04,061 --> 00:39:04,930
coming off the ocean.

1376
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,760
It's just totally different sort of vibe.

1377
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:07,810
It's a totally different life.

1378
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:10,810
I mean what are we
living by the beach guys?

1379
00:39:10,811 --> 00:39:13,780
So we have both of those live
on the beach and the stars.

1380
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:16,840
But the stars I think at that
motherfucker of all motherfuckers,

1381
00:39:16,990 --> 00:39:17,580
it's like the,

1382
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:18,620
the forest too though.

1383
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:19,950
Forest.

1384
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,460
Well everywhere.

1385
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:25,330
I mean Hawaii is amazing too.

1386
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,260
I was in Hilo,

1387
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:30,700
went through Hilo and he
drove like the mountain.

1388
00:39:30,830 --> 00:39:32,980
The Hilo is just one of
the cities in Hawaii.

1389
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:34,383
Are you thinking about Kona

1390
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:36,733
on the Big Island?

1391
00:39:36,770 --> 00:39:37,570
We're talking about wife who,

1392
00:39:37,570 --> 00:39:38,380
we were just,

1393
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:38,921
we were there.

1394
00:39:38,921 --> 00:39:40,390
There was this canyon,

1395
00:39:40,450 --> 00:39:41,050
is that what,

1396
00:39:41,050 --> 00:39:42,100
what the by the water?

1397
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:42,880
Yeah.

1398
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:47,170
There was this literally thousand foot
waterfall running right off the north

1399
00:39:47,890 --> 00:39:49,150
west coast of the island.

1400
00:39:49,151 --> 00:39:50,170
I think that's the big island.

1401
00:39:50,171 --> 00:39:50,291
Yeah.

1402
00:39:50,291 --> 00:39:50,620
Yeah.

1403
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:51,453
Wow.

1404
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:52,840
It looks like drastic park.

1405
00:39:53,530 --> 00:39:55,420
Legitimately like didn't they film that?

1406
00:39:55,421 --> 00:39:56,290
They're probably,

1407
00:39:56,291 --> 00:39:57,260
I would imagine they did.

1408
00:39:57,790 --> 00:39:59,110
I think they did on a Wahoo.

1409
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,340
They bought last.

1410
00:40:00,341 --> 00:40:00,611
Yeah,

1411
00:40:00,611 --> 00:40:01,444
they film bar.

1412
00:40:02,910 --> 00:40:03,743
Amazing.

1413
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:07,560
We went in July with some really
good friends of ours and um,

1414
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:08,140
I,

1415
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:10,090
I've personally never
been anywhere tropical,

1416
00:40:10,091 --> 00:40:11,230
so that was my first time.

1417
00:40:11,290 --> 00:40:14,290
Hawaii was your first tropical
trip like two months ago.

1418
00:40:14,290 --> 00:40:14,981
And it's the best,

1419
00:40:14,981 --> 00:40:15,071
what?

1420
00:40:15,071 --> 00:40:16,240
It such a crazy one too,

1421
00:40:16,241 --> 00:40:17,590
because it's not just tropical,

1422
00:40:17,690 --> 00:40:17,901
you know,

1423
00:40:17,901 --> 00:40:21,520
there's the rain forest every like the
volcanic fields and the people are cool

1424
00:40:21,521 --> 00:40:22,300
as shit.

1425
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:23,500
I love people.

1426
00:40:24,310 --> 00:40:24,461
You know,

1427
00:40:24,461 --> 00:40:25,570
people always say like you,

1428
00:40:25,571 --> 00:40:25,811
you'll,

1429
00:40:25,811 --> 00:40:27,060
you'll hear that like Hawaiians,

1430
00:40:27,070 --> 00:40:28,720
like negative towards white people,

1431
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:29,231
you know,

1432
00:40:29,231 --> 00:40:30,730
a negative towards mainlanders.

1433
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:33,490
But I just think there's too
many of us that are Douche bags.

1434
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:34,793
That's what it is.

1435
00:40:34,990 --> 00:40:38,960
We come over there and my
fucking airplane ticket costs.

1436
00:40:38,961 --> 00:40:41,200
You get over here to your
fucking stupid island man.

1437
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:42,993
And these people are like,

1438
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,490
my ancestors came over
here in a fucking canoe.

1439
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:46,333
Bitch,

1440
00:40:47,110 --> 00:40:48,580
it's tough people.

1441
00:40:48,581 --> 00:40:49,414
Fuck man.

1442
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:50,860
What could we could,

1443
00:40:50,861 --> 00:40:53,110
we met this guy named [inaudible]
Veka and he was helping,

1444
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:56,440
we were staying in a place that was
literally right on the beach so we could

1445
00:40:56,441 --> 00:40:59,890
walk out 20 yards and be snorkeling.

1446
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:04,270
And he was just instructing
us about the wildlife.

1447
00:41:04,271 --> 00:41:05,104
Don't touch that.

1448
00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:06,743
He

1449
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:10,300
had learned in set in,

1450
00:41:10,330 --> 00:41:10,810
in a,

1451
00:41:10,810 --> 00:41:12,670
in a way that he would've
just shrugged off.

1452
00:41:12,690 --> 00:41:12,940
You know,

1453
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:14,170
he just brushed it off his shoulder.

1454
00:41:14,290 --> 00:41:16,780
This dude got an urgent
or some sort of spine.

1455
00:41:16,781 --> 00:41:19,480
I wish I knew what spiky ones.

1456
00:41:19,481 --> 00:41:20,640
He got to one of those
and they didn't put,

1457
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:21,790
man,

1458
00:41:21,790 --> 00:41:24,040
this dude had it impaled
through his wrist.

1459
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:24,520
Whoa.

1460
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:25,390
And you can't take it out.

1461
00:41:25,391 --> 00:41:26,224
It's too brittle.

1462
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:27,940
He had it in his risk for a year.

1463
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:28,871
It just happens.

1464
00:41:28,871 --> 00:41:29,704
It just slowly,

1465
00:41:30,610 --> 00:41:31,000
you know,

1466
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:31,271
it's like,

1467
00:41:31,271 --> 00:41:31,550
okay,

1468
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:36,550
that's both had you had one on your
thumb and I had one on my foot and like I

1469
00:41:36,771 --> 00:41:38,210
felt it for like three months,

1470
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:38,991
you know,

1471
00:41:38,991 --> 00:41:39,620
like it was,

1472
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:40,550
I'd have these loans from like,

1473
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:41,210
you know what,

1474
00:41:41,210 --> 00:41:43,880
for a jog or whatever and I'm
like my fucking pinky toe.

1475
00:41:44,270 --> 00:41:44,900
It's all,

1476
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:46,040
it's all swollen,

1477
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:47,680
but it's a great reminder to,

1478
00:41:47,690 --> 00:41:48,290
it's just like,

1479
00:41:48,290 --> 00:41:49,280
that's like the stars.

1480
00:41:49,281 --> 00:41:50,130
I honestly think so.

1481
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:52,610
When you have that kind of interaction
with nature and it's still there and you

1482
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:52,920
think,

1483
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:53,211
fuck,

1484
00:41:53,211 --> 00:41:53,601
that hurts,

1485
00:41:53,601 --> 00:41:55,050
but it's because I did this.

1486
00:41:55,051 --> 00:41:58,190
It's because I was in that environment
and I need to be exposed to that shit.

1487
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:04,280
And it was just that one little spot
where you can get right through it.

1488
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:05,563
But you know,

1489
00:42:05,710 --> 00:42:06,543
it's okay.

1490
00:42:07,630 --> 00:42:10,680
Oh Jesus with a four year old stuff on it.

1491
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:14,150
But the guys at the hotel,

1492
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:18,620
they knew some shit and they had like
some sort of vinegar and they put it on

1493
00:42:18,621 --> 00:42:18,801
it.

1494
00:42:18,801 --> 00:42:22,320
I put it on it for like 20 minutes and
it was pretty good and I worked out that

1495
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:25,670
night and then it felt better like I felt
like if I worked out on it to kind of

1496
00:42:25,671 --> 00:42:26,600
smash it all up,

1497
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:30,690
whatever's in there and it would slowly
make its way out well and they make it

1498
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:32,120
urgent is make it really clear.

1499
00:42:32,270 --> 00:42:33,410
They're not like surprise,

1500
00:42:33,411 --> 00:42:34,140
I got you.

1501
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:34,973
They're

1502
00:42:36,570 --> 00:42:37,403
like

1503
00:42:39,110 --> 00:42:39,943
landmines

1504
00:42:41,630 --> 00:42:45,320
maybe don't do that and I was going
to pick one up like a fucking idiot.

1505
00:42:45,430 --> 00:42:46,310
How would you do that?

1506
00:42:46,350 --> 00:42:47,540
Because I was fascinated.

1507
00:42:47,541 --> 00:42:48,330
I've never been anywhere.

1508
00:42:48,330 --> 00:42:49,163
Tropical

1509
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:52,860
Rusty Blade and you look around
and everybody knows anyone.

1510
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:53,703
We picked that up.

1511
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:54,753
My challenge

1512
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:57,993
was amazing though.

1513
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:02,650
The Sea Turtles Angels,

1514
00:43:02,690 --> 00:43:03,523
I swear to God,

1515
00:43:05,870 --> 00:43:07,010
they were just right there.

1516
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:08,950
You just want to drink
more of this whiskey.

1517
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:13,010
I'm a big fan of all those animals.

1518
00:43:13,011 --> 00:43:14,780
We went swimming with dolphins,

1519
00:43:14,781 --> 00:43:15,614
which was amazing.

1520
00:43:16,130 --> 00:43:18,140
I had my four year old
with me in the water.

1521
00:43:18,141 --> 00:43:20,470
I was holding onto her and
she's snorkeling with me.

1522
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:25,220
I want to expose her to as
much really crazy shit early.

1523
00:43:25,221 --> 00:43:26,690
So it seems normal to her.

1524
00:43:27,070 --> 00:43:27,400
You know,

1525
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:29,600
like I've already started
teaching her martial arts

1526
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:32,720
and the six year olds pretty good,

1527
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:36,140
you know like and like probably
take to that stuff really naturally.

1528
00:43:36,490 --> 00:43:37,130
I think it's,

1529
00:43:37,130 --> 00:43:40,640
I think there's certain aspects of
certain movements that are just normal and

1530
00:43:40,641 --> 00:43:42,050
natural for people if you
teach them how to do it.

1531
00:43:42,230 --> 00:43:44,450
But I think there's also like
learned experience in DNA.

1532
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:44,781
But anyway,

1533
00:43:44,781 --> 00:43:48,290
the point is like she wasn't scared of
going in the ocean and being with the

1534
00:43:48,291 --> 00:43:48,741
dolphins,

1535
00:43:48,741 --> 00:43:49,990
cause she didn't know any better for,

1536
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:50,740
you know,

1537
00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:52,680
if I waited until she
was nine and I said it's,

1538
00:43:52,681 --> 00:43:55,010
she might go one on
one if there's a shark,

1539
00:43:55,460 --> 00:43:56,150
but she's four.

1540
00:43:56,150 --> 00:43:56,460
I'm like,

1541
00:43:56,460 --> 00:43:57,081
it'll be fine.

1542
00:43:57,081 --> 00:43:57,351
She's like,

1543
00:43:57,351 --> 00:43:58,184
okay

1544
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:00,320
women around.

1545
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:01,380
I was on Qy,

1546
00:44:01,610 --> 00:44:03,830
I've been to Hawaii twice the
time that we were talking about.

1547
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:09,160
And this one other times I'm quiet and
I saw a family and we were on a dock and

1548
00:44:09,621 --> 00:44:12,260
the dock was probably
10 feet off the water.

1549
00:44:12,261 --> 00:44:12,740
Right.

1550
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:16,220
And there's a bunch of family members
in the water and then a dude dangling a

1551
00:44:16,221 --> 00:44:19,550
little kid off the side and it gets
like an Aflac and then they just drop it

1552
00:44:19,551 --> 00:44:20,720
sploosh Oh my God.

1553
00:44:20,721 --> 00:44:21,950
And then they save it and it's fine.

1554
00:44:21,951 --> 00:44:23,090
But that's the,

1555
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:24,110
that's how they get used to it.

1556
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:25,240
They just,

1557
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:26,073
I don't know

1558
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:27,710
either.

1559
00:44:27,710 --> 00:44:28,760
You're traumatized.

1560
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:30,020
You're Michael Phelps.

1561
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:32,030
That's how that works.

1562
00:44:33,330 --> 00:44:35,400
And then how Michael
Phelps learned to swim.

1563
00:44:35,401 --> 00:44:38,850
I don't think what you asked me like I
know that well cause you just referenced

1564
00:44:38,851 --> 00:44:39,550
him then,

1565
00:44:39,550 --> 00:44:40,110
you know.

1566
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:45,110
But the point is that I have back up your
claims are that create a model while I

1567
00:44:46,291 --> 00:44:48,360
was taking a little poetic license and

1568
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,020
give that man is weed back,

1569
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:56,370
giving him his weed back.

1570
00:44:56,371 --> 00:44:57,780
He tested him for weed all the time.

1571
00:44:57,781 --> 00:44:58,614
That's the problem.

1572
00:45:00,290 --> 00:45:02,440
We got plenty more with that.

1573
00:45:04,310 --> 00:45:06,510
Just to defend my Michael
pelleve statement one more time.

1574
00:45:06,511 --> 00:45:07,750
We were talking earlier Charlotte,

1575
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:09,570
my shitty stories create,

1576
00:45:09,610 --> 00:45:10,443
hold on.

1577
00:45:13,350 --> 00:45:15,060
Ben is slow with the cheers.

1578
00:45:15,090 --> 00:45:16,680
I'm really sorry for serving you guys.

1579
00:45:16,681 --> 00:45:17,550
Your drink so slow.

1580
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:20,913
Turns it around.

1581
00:45:21,590 --> 00:45:24,660
I'm supposed to drive a bucket of whiskey.

1582
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:26,480
We have a newer service.

1583
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:28,530
We have a car service called blue bear.

1584
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:28,891
No,

1585
00:45:28,891 --> 00:45:29,041
no.

1586
00:45:29,041 --> 00:45:30,470
We have a real car service on.

1587
00:45:30,710 --> 00:45:34,920
And do you hear about the Uber driver who
hit the guy in the face with a hammer?

1588
00:45:36,260 --> 00:45:37,680
He hit the guy in the back seat.

1589
00:45:37,681 --> 00:45:38,760
The passenger with a hammer.

1590
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:40,200
I have done in the front seat.

1591
00:45:40,201 --> 00:45:40,531
I don't know,

1592
00:45:40,531 --> 00:45:42,440
but the passenger like there's,

1593
00:45:42,810 --> 00:45:44,760
and I'm sure these stories are
going to just keep coming out,

1594
00:45:44,761 --> 00:45:47,220
but first kind of Uber Freak
out that I had heard of.

1595
00:45:48,340 --> 00:45:48,600
Okay,

1596
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:52,320
this shit is unregulated in
a seat was like really bad.

1597
00:45:52,410 --> 00:45:53,243
He could have been a dick.

1598
00:45:53,370 --> 00:45:53,620
Maybe.

1599
00:45:53,620 --> 00:45:54,453
It was like,

1600
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:56,071
am I crazy?

1601
00:45:56,071 --> 00:45:56,904
You know what I'm talking about?

1602
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:58,020
The guy was trying to bite his dick.

1603
00:45:58,140 --> 00:46:00,930
Uber Hammer attack may clarify
firms responsibilities.

1604
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:02,153
Wow.

1605
00:46:02,490 --> 00:46:02,850
Damn.

1606
00:46:02,850 --> 00:46:05,460
Well they've definitely been is that
the guy got hit with the hammer.

1607
00:46:05,461 --> 00:46:06,390
Wow.

1608
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:08,040
Oh my God.

1609
00:46:08,290 --> 00:46:08,530
You know,

1610
00:46:08,530 --> 00:46:09,510
for getting hit with a hammer,

1611
00:46:09,511 --> 00:46:10,450
he doesn't have to bash.

1612
00:46:11,820 --> 00:46:16,290
I felt they've been expanding
at a pretty miraculous rate.

1613
00:46:16,291 --> 00:46:18,840
Like Uber and Lyft are
just growing and grow.

1614
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:19,913
More and more.

1615
00:46:20,230 --> 00:46:24,390
If you're getting higher volume
of of employees coming in,

1616
00:46:24,391 --> 00:46:27,060
you're going to get crazy in
there every now and again.

1617
00:46:27,061 --> 00:46:27,811
Right it good point.

1618
00:46:27,811 --> 00:46:28,770
Rational Suzanne,

1619
00:46:28,771 --> 00:46:29,610
proper rational.

1620
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:34,110
What can we do about
peace in the Middle East?

1621
00:46:34,111 --> 00:46:35,800
Suzanne net pass,

1622
00:46:38,190 --> 00:46:39,023
smart move.

1623
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:43,830
You fucking person on earth you'd say,

1624
00:46:44,850 --> 00:46:46,700
oh I don't,

1625
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:50,340
I don't feel equipped or comfortable
to get into that conversation but I did

1626
00:46:50,341 --> 00:46:51,174
tell you,

1627
00:46:51,270 --> 00:46:55,560
I'm reading a lot of Chomsky lately
and it's such an argumentative subject.

1628
00:46:56,340 --> 00:47:01,340
I'd rather just talk about
rebuilding can wilderness good calls,

1629
00:47:03,390 --> 00:47:05,940
but also I feel like fucking
Pansy at the same time.

1630
00:47:05,941 --> 00:47:07,080
I was thinking about this this morning,

1631
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:09,240
like what do you stand for?

1632
00:47:09,241 --> 00:47:12,010
Like do you sit on the
sidelines and let it,

1633
00:47:12,260 --> 00:47:16,950
like you have your relationship with it
and you let it sort of transpire the way

1634
00:47:16,951 --> 00:47:18,390
it's going to or,

1635
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:20,040
but there's already too
many players on the field.

1636
00:47:20,041 --> 00:47:20,874
You know what I'm saying?

1637
00:47:21,470 --> 00:47:25,020
There's already over like 15 aside and
they don't need more people being like,

1638
00:47:25,021 --> 00:47:25,854
ehh,

1639
00:47:26,570 --> 00:47:29,980
but without like two to
Norfolk and Hornier Ben,

1640
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:33,130
we have a platform that
is continuing to grow.

1641
00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:35,080
And I'm not saying that that's our,

1642
00:47:35,110 --> 00:47:37,840
that's not what we're here for.

1643
00:47:37,841 --> 00:47:38,130
Like we're,

1644
00:47:38,130 --> 00:47:42,520
we're here to play music anywhere
platform and spread love and you know,

1645
00:47:42,521 --> 00:47:43,354
be,

1646
00:47:43,420 --> 00:47:43,691
you know,

1647
00:47:43,691 --> 00:47:44,291
what we are.

1648
00:47:44,291 --> 00:47:46,540
But at the same time we also have,

1649
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:47,170
uh,

1650
00:47:47,170 --> 00:47:48,310
an opportunity to,

1651
00:47:48,311 --> 00:47:52,030
if there's something really important
that we believe in to talk about it.

1652
00:47:52,090 --> 00:47:54,670
Now I'm not saying I want to talk about
peace in the Middle East because I,

1653
00:47:54,671 --> 00:47:55,001
again,

1654
00:47:55,001 --> 00:47:56,800
I don't feel qualified for that,

1655
00:47:57,130 --> 00:47:58,520
but I had this car,

1656
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:00,130
like how this reckoning this morning,

1657
00:48:00,131 --> 00:48:00,491
or I was like,

1658
00:48:00,491 --> 00:48:01,920
what are you going to do Suzanne?

1659
00:48:01,921 --> 00:48:02,500
I'm like,

1660
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:06,070
how are you going to handle
this kind of energy if,

1661
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:08,800
if that's the right thing to do.

1662
00:48:08,801 --> 00:48:09,330
You know what I'm saying?

1663
00:48:09,330 --> 00:48:09,431
Right,

1664
00:48:09,431 --> 00:48:09,521
right,

1665
00:48:09,521 --> 00:48:09,710
right.

1666
00:48:09,710 --> 00:48:10,700
I know I'm kind of babbling.

1667
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:11,031
No,

1668
00:48:11,031 --> 00:48:11,181
no,

1669
00:48:11,181 --> 00:48:11,331
no,

1670
00:48:11,331 --> 00:48:12,164
you're not.

1671
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:13,170
It's that,

1672
00:48:13,170 --> 00:48:18,170
that anx of not really being able to fix
some of the primary concerns of doing

1673
00:48:18,321 --> 00:48:19,154
our part.

1674
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:21,050
I think you just said the perfect answer,

1675
00:48:21,051 --> 00:48:22,010
which is we don't know.

1676
00:48:22,150 --> 00:48:22,381
And,

1677
00:48:22,381 --> 00:48:23,214
and it,

1678
00:48:23,270 --> 00:48:27,350
it doesn't help the situation to just
introduce energy into it to be like,

1679
00:48:27,380 --> 00:48:27,711
ah,

1680
00:48:27,711 --> 00:48:28,401
that's fucked up.

1681
00:48:28,401 --> 00:48:28,641
It's like,

1682
00:48:28,641 --> 00:48:28,821
yeah,

1683
00:48:28,821 --> 00:48:29,960
we all know it's fucked up.

1684
00:48:30,050 --> 00:48:32,750
I think there's people that are
compelled to fix the system.

1685
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:35,780
There's people that are compelled to
point out the flaws in the system.

1686
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:38,570
There's people that are
compelled to inspire others.

1687
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:40,010
Maybe that's where you guys are.

1688
00:48:40,350 --> 00:48:43,370
He might inspire others with
your words or your music or your,

1689
00:48:43,430 --> 00:48:43,851
you know,

1690
00:48:43,851 --> 00:48:46,370
your combination of your
talent and your points of view.

1691
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:47,181
My influence,

1692
00:48:47,181 --> 00:48:48,020
people's ideas.

1693
00:48:48,021 --> 00:48:51,290
And then in turn that sets like,

1694
00:48:51,291 --> 00:48:55,880
I think whenever like someone like me
who makes a lot of sense or someone who

1695
00:48:55,881 --> 00:49:00,230
speaks in a way that makes you
realign your perceptions of the world,

1696
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:03,800
when they communicate with folks and
they put something in their head,

1697
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:08,390
those people may spread those
ideas out and add to them and,

1698
00:49:08,580 --> 00:49:08,810
and,

1699
00:49:08,810 --> 00:49:09,170
and,

1700
00:49:09,170 --> 00:49:10,490
and it goes further and
further and further.

1701
00:49:10,670 --> 00:49:14,870
And then eventually all of that influences
the culture in a more positive way

1702
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:18,860
than most protests or most,

1703
00:49:18,950 --> 00:49:23,950
I mean there's very few like really
like angry violent reactions.

1704
00:49:25,970 --> 00:49:28,910
What they do is they cause
people to become defensive.

1705
00:49:29,210 --> 00:49:31,490
They cause people to
reexamine the situation.

1706
00:49:31,491 --> 00:49:34,070
But what causes people to
really change themselves?

1707
00:49:34,071 --> 00:49:35,540
It's almost always inspiration.

1708
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:37,510
It's almost always wanting to be inspired.

1709
00:49:37,511 --> 00:49:38,900
Like if you see someone that like,

1710
00:49:38,901 --> 00:49:43,100
have you ever gone to see like someone
performed live and you just go fuck and

1711
00:49:43,101 --> 00:49:45,470
you just want to go home and play and
you just want to go home and practice,

1712
00:49:45,660 --> 00:49:45,920
right?

1713
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:46,300
Yeah.

1714
00:49:46,300 --> 00:49:47,690
Like that fuel.

1715
00:49:47,780 --> 00:49:48,030
Yeah.

1716
00:49:48,030 --> 00:49:50,120
Like sometimes you'll go
see a movie and it just,

1717
00:49:50,121 --> 00:49:51,110
it's so good.

1718
00:49:51,111 --> 00:49:52,370
You just want to go to the gym.

1719
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:53,533
You know?

1720
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:56,600
Like sometimes these things happen,

1721
00:49:56,620 --> 00:49:57,140
you know,

1722
00:49:57,140 --> 00:50:00,680
talking about like sometimes you're
in your car and fucking song comes on.

1723
00:50:00,681 --> 00:50:02,330
It just changes your state.

1724
00:50:02,780 --> 00:50:03,111
You know,

1725
00:50:03,111 --> 00:50:03,471
you just,

1726
00:50:03,471 --> 00:50:04,980
all of a sudden you just fee,

1727
00:50:04,981 --> 00:50:07,040
you get that feeling washes over you.

1728
00:50:07,070 --> 00:50:07,701
Fuck.

1729
00:50:07,701 --> 00:50:08,840
Yeah.

1730
00:50:08,990 --> 00:50:09,920
You know the,

1731
00:50:10,030 --> 00:50:13,310
those things for you and you,

1732
00:50:13,311 --> 00:50:15,110
Ben and Suzanne for you.

1733
00:50:15,111 --> 00:50:16,340
Can you do this?

1734
00:50:16,341 --> 00:50:16,851
Is your,

1735
00:50:16,851 --> 00:50:17,840
this is your avenue,

1736
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:20,590
this is your avenue for
change is what really set me.

1737
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:21,131
Honestly,

1738
00:50:21,131 --> 00:50:21,280
I,

1739
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:21,760
I,

1740
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:23,470
I've been like thinking about this a lot.

1741
00:50:23,471 --> 00:50:24,480
I really appreciate that.

1742
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:25,540
You don't need to,

1743
00:50:25,540 --> 00:50:28,220
everybody doesn't need
to try to fix the world.

1744
00:50:28,310 --> 00:50:29,570
Everybody can't fix the world.

1745
00:50:29,590 --> 00:50:31,490
Is this on the drive over here?

1746
00:50:31,491 --> 00:50:32,320
A little bit.

1747
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:33,153
So anyone,

1748
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:34,490
it's not about fixing the world,

1749
00:50:34,491 --> 00:50:36,800
it's just about making sure that I'm,

1750
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:37,873
um,

1751
00:50:38,180 --> 00:50:39,710
I don't to say doing
what I'm supposed to do,

1752
00:50:39,711 --> 00:50:40,680
but like not,

1753
00:50:40,940 --> 00:50:41,300
not,

1754
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:44,390
not a sitting out when I should,

1755
00:50:44,510 --> 00:50:45,060
should be.

1756
00:50:45,060 --> 00:50:45,950
You shouldn't be.

1757
00:50:45,951 --> 00:50:46,280
You know,

1758
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:47,180
I'm kind of like,

1759
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:51,470
but I think the point of what he's saying
is by following through on something,

1760
00:50:51,471 --> 00:50:52,670
you're passionate about it,

1761
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:53,421
you are,

1762
00:50:53,421 --> 00:50:57,200
that that is the best thing you can do
because it creates those environments for

1763
00:50:57,201 --> 00:50:58,034
other people.

1764
00:50:58,050 --> 00:50:58,640
Um,

1765
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:03,640
and having opinions like expressing
yourself once you've like,

1766
00:51:04,090 --> 00:51:04,280
like,

1767
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:04,381
well,

1768
00:51:04,381 --> 00:51:05,061
you guys are doing,

1769
00:51:05,061 --> 00:51:06,650
you're establishing your music,

1770
00:51:06,651 --> 00:51:07,610
establishing your art,

1771
00:51:07,611 --> 00:51:10,250
and then you have opinions
and then people go,

1772
00:51:10,340 --> 00:51:10,671
God,

1773
00:51:10,671 --> 00:51:12,650
this guy seems so cool
and they make sense.

1774
00:51:12,770 --> 00:51:13,603
That doesn't make sense.

1775
00:51:14,110 --> 00:51:14,350
You know,

1776
00:51:14,350 --> 00:51:15,183
it's crazy.

1777
00:51:15,250 --> 00:51:16,490
I would

1778
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:21,590
be becoming more and more comfortable
with opinions changing in my own opinion

1779
00:51:21,591 --> 00:51:22,880
is changing because I think I,

1780
00:51:23,060 --> 00:51:23,781
I've actually been,

1781
00:51:23,781 --> 00:51:25,580
which I didn't understand it as this,

1782
00:51:25,581 --> 00:51:27,230
but it's a conservative
mindset to be like,

1783
00:51:27,231 --> 00:51:27,351
no,

1784
00:51:27,351 --> 00:51:28,161
this is my opinion.

1785
00:51:28,161 --> 00:51:28,971
I'm sticking to it.

1786
00:51:28,971 --> 00:51:29,450
You know,

1787
00:51:29,450 --> 00:51:31,010
I've been reading this Dylan book,

1788
00:51:31,210 --> 00:51:31,760
um,

1789
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:32,110
and the,

1790
00:51:32,110 --> 00:51:33,830
the is the reason I'm bringing it up,

1791
00:51:34,130 --> 00:51:35,720
it's fascinating because I'm reading this,

1792
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:39,200
all these interviews with him throughout
his career and I just got to 1980

1793
00:51:39,201 --> 00:51:39,650
right.

1794
00:51:39,650 --> 00:51:40,311
And He,

1795
00:51:40,311 --> 00:51:41,960
this is him like counterculture figure,

1796
00:51:41,961 --> 00:51:44,390
like [inaudible]

1797
00:51:46,350 --> 00:51:48,500
and 1980 he's a born again Christian,

1798
00:51:48,650 --> 00:51:50,890
like legitimately Christ,

1799
00:51:51,190 --> 00:51:53,120
the crisis of the way and the light.

1800
00:51:53,121 --> 00:51:57,200
This is what I believe in was a born
again Christian hundred and 10% honestly.

1801
00:51:57,430 --> 00:52:01,100
And it's amazing to see this dude who
so comfortable and just like inhabiting

1802
00:52:01,101 --> 00:52:02,960
what he is experiencing at that time.

1803
00:52:03,350 --> 00:52:03,780
You know,

1804
00:52:03,780 --> 00:52:04,491
let's look it up.

1805
00:52:04,491 --> 00:52:05,390
This is what I'm doing.

1806
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:06,830
He wants to double check.

1807
00:52:07,370 --> 00:52:10,590
This shit is double checking
from the post [inaudible] mouth.

1808
00:52:10,940 --> 00:52:11,550
Wow.

1809
00:52:11,550 --> 00:52:12,200
I'm saying,

1810
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:12,501
but,

1811
00:52:12,501 --> 00:52:12,921
but it's,

1812
00:52:12,921 --> 00:52:15,010
it's a shocker to see these words cause I,

1813
00:52:15,020 --> 00:52:16,460
this is just my upbringing,

1814
00:52:16,490 --> 00:52:19,280
it when someone talks
about Jesus that openly,

1815
00:52:19,281 --> 00:52:22,010
I get kind of freaked out
because of my shit I guess.

1816
00:52:22,580 --> 00:52:25,670
But to hear him talk about this,

1817
00:52:26,820 --> 00:52:29,830
it just like realize we'd
like people fucking chain.

1818
00:52:29,850 --> 00:52:30,800
This is a Bob Dylan,

1819
00:52:30,801 --> 00:52:32,360
jesus.com page

1820
00:52:34,340 --> 00:52:35,173
details.

1821
00:52:35,660 --> 00:52:37,520
Bob Dylan's Jesus years.

1822
00:52:37,610 --> 00:52:38,420
Yeah.

1823
00:52:38,420 --> 00:52:39,600
He was Bob Jones.

1824
00:52:39,650 --> 00:52:40,011
For Jews,

1825
00:52:40,011 --> 00:52:40,341
for Jesus.

1826
00:52:40,341 --> 00:52:41,960
So many different people.

1827
00:52:43,010 --> 00:52:43,910
Some artists,

1828
00:52:44,650 --> 00:52:45,200
you know,

1829
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:48,260
it takes chances when
you really see in this,

1830
00:52:48,330 --> 00:52:48,840
uh,

1831
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:49,340
uh,

1832
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:50,330
just in reading these things,

1833
00:52:50,331 --> 00:52:54,080
this dude was using a persona and
still it's like Bob Dylan is something,

1834
00:52:54,110 --> 00:52:56,690
he sets it aside from himself
and that's how we figure it out,

1835
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:57,680
trying to create,

1836
00:52:57,950 --> 00:52:58,341
you know what I mean?

1837
00:52:58,341 --> 00:52:58,820
He's like,

1838
00:52:58,820 --> 00:52:59,990
that's Bob Dylan and he's,

1839
00:52:59,991 --> 00:53:03,050
I can kind of remove myself and
do whatever the fuck I want.

1840
00:53:03,051 --> 00:53:04,070
Now I'm kind of,

1841
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:05,213
uh,

1842
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:06,021
not blameless,

1843
00:53:06,021 --> 00:53:08,330
but like a disassociated almost.

1844
00:53:08,420 --> 00:53:09,253
Wow.

1845
00:53:09,410 --> 00:53:10,340
I don't know about all that.

1846
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:10,860
Oh,

1847
00:53:10,860 --> 00:53:15,860
[inaudible] documentary,

1848
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:18,290
who's a film.

1849
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:19,280
This is a film.

1850
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:22,790
Well inside Bob Dylan's
Jesus hears is a film,

1851
00:53:24,690 --> 00:53:25,600
which guy from the

1852
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:27,053
towns it,

1853
00:53:27,270 --> 00:53:27,610
oh,

1854
00:53:27,610 --> 00:53:28,201
was he's the one that,

1855
00:53:28,201 --> 00:53:30,440
he was the one that got
caught looking at child porn.

1856
00:53:30,820 --> 00:53:31,653
Got cleared.

1857
00:53:31,670 --> 00:53:32,550
He got cleared,

1858
00:53:32,551 --> 00:53:33,384
man.

1859
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:34,980
Yeah,

1860
00:53:34,980 --> 00:53:35,813
that's right.

1861
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:37,770
He got cleaned out and masturbation.

1862
00:53:38,220 --> 00:53:38,881
He got cleared.

1863
00:53:38,881 --> 00:53:39,714
But what does that mean?

1864
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:40,830
That means like he was,

1865
00:53:40,831 --> 00:53:41,220
he,

1866
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:43,740
this is a dude has been
sexually molested as a child,

1867
00:53:43,741 --> 00:53:44,101
his life.

1868
00:53:44,101 --> 00:53:44,934
And he was doing,

1869
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:45,480
um,

1870
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:47,640
like a project trying to expose shit.

1871
00:53:47,660 --> 00:53:47,981
Right.

1872
00:53:47,981 --> 00:53:48,151
You know,

1873
00:53:48,151 --> 00:53:48,481
being like,

1874
00:53:48,481 --> 00:53:49,380
this is fucked up,

1875
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:50,041
you know,

1876
00:53:50,041 --> 00:53:51,870
and you kind of got outed for and look,

1877
00:53:51,871 --> 00:53:52,051
I,

1878
00:53:52,051 --> 00:53:52,591
I mean,

1879
00:53:52,591 --> 00:53:53,700
I'm not an expert on it,

1880
00:53:53,701 --> 00:53:55,160
so I hope this doesn't bite.

1881
00:53:55,410 --> 00:53:55,780
Right.

1882
00:53:55,780 --> 00:53:56,700
I hope you're right.

1883
00:53:57,150 --> 00:53:57,841
I hope you're right.

1884
00:53:57,841 --> 00:53:59,820
I definitely don't want
him to be a child molester.

1885
00:54:01,470 --> 00:54:02,370
Healthy viewpoint.

1886
00:54:02,830 --> 00:54:03,663
Yeah.

1887
00:54:03,690 --> 00:54:06,120
I try to look towards the positive at all.

1888
00:54:07,690 --> 00:54:08,523
It was,

1889
00:54:08,540 --> 00:54:10,770
but he's an odd guy like he does.

1890
00:54:10,890 --> 00:54:15,890
He admit while he made a statement about
homosexuality or about being a woman

1891
00:54:16,501 --> 00:54:19,700
about how he had been a
woman in his life and it was,

1892
00:54:19,710 --> 00:54:21,830
it was very strange
because it was like there's

1893
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:28,400
no in a sexual sense like he had
been the receiving and of male sex,

1894
00:54:29,610 --> 00:54:29,881
you know,

1895
00:54:29,881 --> 00:54:31,080
so he had like played

1896
00:54:32,980 --> 00:54:33,813
catcher.

1897
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,230
I think you'd have to talk.

1898
00:54:36,270 --> 00:54:37,200
Did Bernie just go

1899
00:54:40,290 --> 00:54:42,740
Pete Townsend here.

1900
00:54:42,850 --> 00:54:43,890
I'll read you the quote.

1901
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:46,140
I'm so excited about my protein powder.

1902
00:54:46,141 --> 00:54:46,770
Joe.

1903
00:54:46,770 --> 00:54:47,640
I'm glad you're happy.

1904
00:54:47,730 --> 00:54:48,563
I really am.

1905
00:54:48,850 --> 00:54:50,610
I'm trying to bulk up Ben Jaffe.

1906
00:54:51,660 --> 00:54:52,493
What are you doing to,

1907
00:54:52,570 --> 00:54:53,520
to a bulk up?

1908
00:54:53,550 --> 00:54:54,121
Well first of all,

1909
00:54:54,121 --> 00:54:54,451
my back,

1910
00:54:54,451 --> 00:54:57,960
it's booked so I'm doing
a lot of core shit is,

1911
00:54:57,961 --> 00:54:58,800
this is quote,

1912
00:54:58,980 --> 00:55:00,540
I know how it feels to be a woman.

1913
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:01,993
I'm a woman.

1914
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:03,953
Fine.

1915
00:55:04,050 --> 00:55:04,920
I'm just telling you,

1916
00:55:05,970 --> 00:55:08,400
just showing a we we unsuccessfully.

1917
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:09,360
What's more important man?

1918
00:55:09,361 --> 00:55:13,350
Your back is temporarily
hurt or time where

1919
00:55:15,540 --> 00:55:16,560
being gay.

1920
00:55:17,190 --> 00:55:17,521
Okay.

1921
00:55:17,521 --> 00:55:17,820
Sorry.

1922
00:55:17,820 --> 00:55:18,653
Did he talk to me?

1923
00:55:19,710 --> 00:55:23,040
That's under boys when
he had his first period,

1924
00:55:23,070 --> 00:55:25,800
or I don't know if you call
it a period when it's a man's,

1925
00:55:25,801 --> 00:55:27,560
but it's not like an egg got dropped.

1926
00:55:30,330 --> 00:55:30,900
He made me,

1927
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:31,171
yeah,

1928
00:55:31,171 --> 00:55:32,220
you're not right.

1929
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:33,113
You're not.

1930
00:55:33,270 --> 00:55:35,500
Do you accept a woman who's like,

1931
00:55:35,790 --> 00:55:36,930
like a transgender woman?

1932
00:55:36,931 --> 00:55:38,790
Do you accept that as a pure woman?

1933
00:55:39,270 --> 00:55:40,103
Absolutely.

1934
00:55:40,330 --> 00:55:41,940
What started me planning period,

1935
00:55:42,090 --> 00:55:42,520
and you're like,

1936
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:43,201
listen bitch,

1937
00:55:43,201 --> 00:55:47,160
I know you ain't got no period for
him to stop attending every month.

1938
00:55:47,220 --> 00:55:48,001
You're freaking out.

1939
00:55:48,001 --> 00:55:48,960
Maybe I'm having my period,

1940
00:55:54,450 --> 00:55:56,740
but you stop bitching
about your fucking period.

1941
00:56:00,390 --> 00:56:03,250
Some transgender woman out there
bitching about her appearance.

1942
00:56:07,340 --> 00:56:09,410
Transgender friends out there listening.

1943
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:11,153
I'll fucking,

1944
00:56:11,610 --> 00:56:12,443
I'll bet you.

1945
00:56:12,690 --> 00:56:12,850
Well,

1946
00:56:12,850 --> 00:56:13,531
first of all,

1947
00:56:13,531 --> 00:56:13,830
let's,

1948
00:56:13,830 --> 00:56:14,663
let's backtrack.

1949
00:56:14,730 --> 00:56:15,870
So you had buck angel?

1950
00:56:16,260 --> 00:56:16,920
Yes.

1951
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:17,620
Buck Angel,

1952
00:56:17,620 --> 00:56:18,453
your,

1953
00:56:18,970 --> 00:56:19,711
we talked about it.

1954
00:56:19,711 --> 00:56:20,740
We talked about,

1955
00:56:20,750 --> 00:56:22,770
I always wanted to have him on the show.

1956
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:23,461
He's cool.

1957
00:56:23,461 --> 00:56:24,310
It's fascinating.

1958
00:56:24,310 --> 00:56:24,670
Awesome.

1959
00:56:24,670 --> 00:56:26,080
He's a really nice guy.

1960
00:56:26,081 --> 00:56:28,240
He's a really nice guy and it's,

1961
00:56:28,420 --> 00:56:28,811
you know,

1962
00:56:28,811 --> 00:56:32,080
I'm very flexible with my
ideas about like gender.

1963
00:56:32,081 --> 00:56:32,914
I don't know.

1964
00:56:33,070 --> 00:56:36,970
I don't begrudge anybody
their own sexual proclivities,

1965
00:56:36,971 --> 00:56:41,971
their own ideas about gender
conformity and about gender identity.

1966
00:56:42,730 --> 00:56:47,680
I have been in this battle with a lot
of transgender people over the last year

1967
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:47,681
or so,

1968
00:56:47,681 --> 00:56:52,240
but it's purely because of one individual
who is purely because of a woman who

1969
00:56:52,241 --> 00:56:53,170
used to be a man.

1970
00:56:53,230 --> 00:56:56,890
She was a man for 30 years and
started MMA fighting against women.

1971
00:56:57,250 --> 00:56:58,083
And uh,

1972
00:56:58,120 --> 00:56:58,953
I was like,

1973
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:00,070
yeah,

1974
00:57:00,070 --> 00:57:00,640
I was like,

1975
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:01,330
no,

1976
00:57:01,330 --> 00:57:02,170
set a bunch of rude,

1977
00:57:02,180 --> 00:57:02,590
mean,

1978
00:57:02,590 --> 00:57:06,370
mean shit that some things that we
don't know that you know that I know.

1979
00:57:06,430 --> 00:57:07,263
You know what I mean?

1980
00:57:09,910 --> 00:57:10,481
Bunch of rude,

1981
00:57:10,481 --> 00:57:11,314
mean shit.

1982
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:15,370
You know that if I like thought about
the possibility that would make other

1983
00:57:15,371 --> 00:57:16,780
transgender people feel bad,

1984
00:57:16,781 --> 00:57:17,890
I probably wouldn't have said again.

1985
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:22,510
But the reality is that it's ridic it's
one thing to say that you're a woman,

1986
00:57:22,511 --> 00:57:26,440
but it's another thing to say that there's
not some crazy mechanical advantages

1987
00:57:26,441 --> 00:57:29,950
to the male frame that you don't lose
when you transitioned to being a woman.

1988
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:30,671
It's not,

1989
00:57:30,671 --> 00:57:31,570
there's a one,

1990
00:57:31,650 --> 00:57:34,750
there's a 10% increase
in reaction to like,

1991
00:57:34,751 --> 00:57:37,840
men have a quicker reaction
time by 10% across the board.

1992
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:40,180
But in some states it's,

1993
00:57:40,550 --> 00:57:40,871
I see.

1994
00:57:40,871 --> 00:57:41,560
That's the other thing.

1995
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:46,560
Why do we even have a problem with a
man like having a fight with a woman?

1996
00:57:46,841 --> 00:57:48,190
Like an actual man having a fight.

1997
00:57:48,191 --> 00:57:48,491
We want to,

1998
00:57:48,491 --> 00:57:49,990
if they both agree on it,

1999
00:57:50,230 --> 00:57:53,350
if the woman knows she's fighting a man
and the man knows he's fighting a woman

2000
00:57:53,351 --> 00:57:54,184
and they both agree.

2001
00:57:54,250 --> 00:57:55,990
If you could fucking ride bulls.

2002
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:56,290
Yeah.

2003
00:57:56,290 --> 00:57:56,681
Okay.

2004
00:57:56,681 --> 00:57:57,514
Watch he came.

2005
00:57:57,580 --> 00:57:58,300
Which you can.

2006
00:57:58,300 --> 00:57:59,560
Why can't you fight?

2007
00:57:59,590 --> 00:58:02,040
Why can't a woman decides she wants
to beat the shit out of a man?

2008
00:58:02,060 --> 00:58:02,770
See if she could do it.

2009
00:58:02,770 --> 00:58:03,760
If they both weigh the same,

2010
00:58:03,910 --> 00:58:04,870
no reason why not.

2011
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:05,710
Hey Joe.

2012
00:58:05,710 --> 00:58:06,250
Hey Man.

2013
00:58:06,250 --> 00:58:06,851
How's the record?

2014
00:58:06,851 --> 00:58:07,450
High Agenda?

2015
00:58:07,450 --> 00:58:07,840
How's it?

2016
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:08,673
How's it record?

2017
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:09,521
How's it record?

2018
00:58:09,521 --> 00:58:10,090
Record does,

2019
00:58:10,090 --> 00:58:11,020
did she win a lot?

2020
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:12,340
Oh yes.

2021
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:13,733
Every time.

2022
00:58:14,350 --> 00:58:16,630
It's not just a win win
and like really quick,

2023
00:58:16,631 --> 00:58:17,440
violent way.

2024
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:18,010
That's horrible.

2025
00:58:18,010 --> 00:58:18,400
Okay.

2026
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:18,761
Yeah.

2027
00:58:18,761 --> 00:58:19,780
Well she lost once though.

2028
00:58:19,781 --> 00:58:20,111
She lost,

2029
00:58:20,111 --> 00:58:21,550
wants to some bad ass bitch.

2030
00:58:22,210 --> 00:58:23,080
She lost once.

2031
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:23,710
Um,

2032
00:58:23,710 --> 00:58:25,650
but it was just like I,

2033
00:58:25,750 --> 00:58:26,410
you know,

2034
00:58:26,410 --> 00:58:27,280
all due respect,

2035
00:58:27,330 --> 00:58:28,300
not trying to be mean.

2036
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:30,910
Her skill level is very rudimentary.

2037
00:58:31,090 --> 00:58:34,240
I watched her movements and there's
nothing substantial about it.

2038
00:58:34,510 --> 00:58:36,770
There's like there's some MMA fighters.

2039
00:58:37,730 --> 00:58:37,990
It,

2040
00:58:37,990 --> 00:58:38,823
well no,

2041
00:58:38,980 --> 00:58:40,660
there's definitely technique involved.

2042
00:58:40,660 --> 00:58:42,310
She definitely knows a lot of techniques.

2043
00:58:42,311 --> 00:58:43,330
She's definitely trains hard.

2044
00:58:43,450 --> 00:58:46,730
There's no doubt about it cause she's
fighting five minute rounds or a w I don't

2045
00:58:46,731 --> 00:58:49,190
know if they fight five minute rounds
in a lot of these female organization.

2046
00:58:49,191 --> 00:58:51,520
Sometimes they lower
the number of minutes,

2047
00:58:51,790 --> 00:58:53,500
but she's definitely talented.

2048
00:58:53,501 --> 00:58:54,520
She definitely can fight.

2049
00:58:54,550 --> 00:58:55,570
There's no doubt about it.

2050
00:58:56,020 --> 00:58:56,560
Um,

2051
00:58:56,560 --> 00:58:59,960
it's not like she's some horrible
amateur that has no idea what she's doing

2052
00:58:59,961 --> 00:59:01,240
because she's knocking people out.

2053
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:01,990
You know,

2054
00:59:01,990 --> 00:59:03,430
whether or not she's knocking,

2055
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,800
you know what they would call sis gender.

2056
00:59:05,801 --> 00:59:08,230
That's what they like to call transgender
people like to call people that were

2057
00:59:08,231 --> 00:59:10,420
born a certain gender called CIS gender.

2058
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:10,781
What is,

2059
00:59:10,781 --> 00:59:11,510
I know it stands for,

2060
00:59:11,510 --> 00:59:12,040
no one knows.

2061
00:59:12,040 --> 00:59:13,060
No one knows it just,

2062
00:59:13,061 --> 00:59:13,894
it's popcorn.

2063
00:59:13,900 --> 00:59:14,830
Why do you call it popcorn?

2064
00:59:14,860 --> 00:59:15,520
You just do.

2065
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:16,030
Okay.

2066
00:59:16,030 --> 00:59:16,863
Okay,

2067
00:59:18,860 --> 00:59:19,693
cool.

2068
00:59:20,510 --> 00:59:22,430
Lake Goulay Koolaid.

2069
00:59:22,530 --> 00:59:23,120
I Dunno,

2070
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:24,410
I cause it's day

2071
00:59:26,270 --> 00:59:26,660
cool.

2072
00:59:26,660 --> 00:59:27,381
Give you diabetes.

2073
00:59:27,381 --> 00:59:28,214
Sorry.

2074
00:59:28,450 --> 00:59:29,283
Oh yeah.

2075
00:59:30,110 --> 00:59:30,270
See,

2076
00:59:30,270 --> 00:59:32,650
but for the first few fights,

2077
00:59:32,651 --> 00:59:34,690
she did admit that she used to be a man.

2078
00:59:34,750 --> 00:59:35,171
Ooh,

2079
00:59:35,171 --> 00:59:36,004
that's fire.

2080
00:59:36,070 --> 00:59:37,340
And she said that they did it.

2081
00:59:37,341 --> 00:59:41,020
It wasn't something that they required
of her and she thought it was a mental or

2082
00:59:41,021 --> 00:59:41,530
medical.

2083
00:59:41,530 --> 00:59:42,280
Yes.

2084
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:42,610
Okay.

2085
00:59:42,610 --> 00:59:43,420
Or I dunno.

2086
00:59:43,420 --> 00:59:43,810
I Dunno.

2087
00:59:43,810 --> 00:59:44,290
I shouldn't,

2088
00:59:44,290 --> 00:59:45,040
I shouldn't say,

2089
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:46,600
I don't know exactly how it came out,

2090
00:59:46,810 --> 00:59:48,850
but the people that have fought or
that didn't know that she used to be,

2091
00:59:48,860 --> 00:59:49,061
man,

2092
00:59:49,061 --> 00:59:50,050
we're pretty fucking upset.

2093
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:51,510
Honestly.

2094
00:59:51,510 --> 00:59:52,650
This is so interesting.

2095
00:59:52,651 --> 00:59:54,810
Like this is fascinating
that at this day and age,

2096
00:59:54,811 --> 00:59:57,030
this is an argument that we have is like,

2097
00:59:57,390 --> 00:59:57,900
you know,

2098
00:59:57,900 --> 00:59:58,680
you have to,

2099
00:59:58,680 --> 01:00:01,140
you have to label something
and then it's like,

2100
01:00:01,230 --> 01:00:02,680
well is it this or is it that and it,

2101
01:00:02,681 --> 01:00:03,810
and it's both things.

2102
01:00:03,811 --> 01:00:04,081
You know,

2103
01:00:04,081 --> 01:00:04,740
it's like,

2104
01:00:04,740 --> 01:00:05,220
um,

2105
01:00:05,220 --> 01:00:06,150
if like,

2106
01:00:06,180 --> 01:00:11,180
is is buck angel a law like the butchest
of lesbians or is Buck Angel a man?

2107
01:00:12,990 --> 01:00:13,231
Right.

2108
01:00:13,231 --> 01:00:13,651
You know what I mean?

2109
01:00:13,651 --> 01:00:15,030
Like first of all,

2110
01:00:15,180 --> 01:00:17,850
I respect buck and I
think that he's great.

2111
01:00:18,350 --> 01:00:18,991
We met him,

2112
01:00:18,991 --> 01:00:19,620
he's great.

2113
01:00:19,620 --> 01:00:20,670
But like at the same time,

2114
01:00:20,671 --> 01:00:23,490
I'm kind of like just
kind of fascinated by the,

2115
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:25,680
the whole conversation to begin with.

2116
01:00:25,830 --> 01:00:26,663
Yeah,

2117
01:00:27,450 --> 01:00:27,691
sorry,

2118
01:00:27,691 --> 01:00:28,200
go ahead.

2119
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:29,060
I was just going to say I,

2120
01:00:29,061 --> 01:00:29,330
I,

2121
01:00:29,330 --> 01:00:31,740
I think it doesn't to
most rational people,

2122
01:00:31,741 --> 01:00:32,420
it doesn't really make it

2123
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:33,740
different in a difference.

2124
01:00:33,741 --> 01:00:36,260
It's like self definition where you
can call yourself whatever you want.

2125
01:00:36,380 --> 01:00:38,540
I think it's when people
start proselytizing about it,

2126
01:00:38,780 --> 01:00:40,940
that's a problem because then,

2127
01:00:41,300 --> 01:00:41,691
I don't know,

2128
01:00:41,691 --> 01:00:43,220
it's invasive in this issue.

2129
01:00:43,250 --> 01:00:45,920
My only concern is that as
a personal safety issue,

2130
01:00:46,040 --> 01:00:46,550
sure.

2131
01:00:46,550 --> 01:00:47,001
And there's a,

2132
01:00:47,001 --> 01:00:47,870
there's sort of like a,

2133
01:00:47,990 --> 01:00:48,481
I don't know,

2134
01:00:48,481 --> 01:00:49,191
I fuck,

2135
01:00:49,191 --> 01:00:50,780
I don't want to get
involved in an argument,

2136
01:00:50,781 --> 01:00:51,614
but you know,

2137
01:00:51,670 --> 01:00:53,090
if anyone on the internet,

2138
01:00:53,091 --> 01:00:56,330
but it almost sort of feels
like a unfair advantage.

2139
01:00:56,470 --> 01:00:56,571
Well,

2140
01:00:56,571 --> 01:00:56,781
no,

2141
01:00:56,781 --> 01:00:57,441
it's an unfair,

2142
01:00:57,441 --> 01:00:57,920
but it is,

2143
01:00:57,920 --> 01:00:58,940
it is an unfair advantage.

2144
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,590
It doesn't mean that the woman
isn't going to win or the other,

2145
01:01:01,670 --> 01:01:03,780
the other woman isn't going
to win well and to do it.

2146
01:01:03,790 --> 01:01:05,070
But it does mean it's just that the,

2147
01:01:05,090 --> 01:01:06,340
the physical advances,

2148
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:10,490
it's often like you can overcome
physical advance with technique,

2149
01:01:10,491 --> 01:01:11,330
but you shouldn't have to.

2150
01:01:11,420 --> 01:01:11,690
Yeah.

2151
01:01:11,690 --> 01:01:13,280
There's certain amount of
physical advance where,

2152
01:01:13,281 --> 01:01:14,114
I don't know,

2153
01:01:14,150 --> 01:01:17,300
I don't think the studies have
really been done on like fighters.

2154
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:20,240
I think there's been some studies
on athletes and athletes reaction,

2155
01:01:20,241 --> 01:01:22,940
but I think the difference
between being a man,

2156
01:01:23,130 --> 01:01:23,450
uh,

2157
01:01:23,450 --> 01:01:27,680
who transitions into being a woman in a
competing in Olympic volleyball is very

2158
01:01:27,681 --> 01:01:30,320
different than being a man
who used to be a woman.

2159
01:01:30,321 --> 01:01:32,300
You transitioned to combat
sports because you're,

2160
01:01:32,301 --> 01:01:32,590
you're,

2161
01:01:32,590 --> 01:01:32,781
you're,

2162
01:01:32,781 --> 01:01:37,100
you're essentially dealing with having
an advantage in dealing out concussions.

2163
01:01:37,220 --> 01:01:37,610
And that's,

2164
01:01:37,610 --> 01:01:38,450
that's a fucking,

2165
01:01:38,630 --> 01:01:39,710
that's a big deal.

2166
01:01:39,970 --> 01:01:42,020
This is a difference in
the way we're shaped,

2167
01:01:42,530 --> 01:01:42,891
you know,

2168
01:01:42,891 --> 01:01:44,990
and the broader shoulders of the male,

2169
01:01:44,991 --> 01:01:46,180
the larger hands,

2170
01:01:46,181 --> 01:01:46,490
the,

2171
01:01:46,490 --> 01:01:49,670
the more narrow hips that
different geometry of the body.

2172
01:01:50,360 --> 01:01:52,010
A man curve of the Brown.

2173
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:52,993
Yeah.

2174
01:02:00,530 --> 01:02:02,020
So why do you run in here with

2175
01:02:03,860 --> 01:02:05,480
Laura Role?

2176
01:02:05,610 --> 01:02:06,021
Careful.

2177
01:02:06,021 --> 01:02:06,854
He's got an angry,

2178
01:02:07,790 --> 01:02:08,890
very fast and furious,

2179
01:02:08,900 --> 01:02:09,733
right?

2180
01:02:10,420 --> 01:02:12,200
Fucking transcend gender togs.

2181
01:02:12,450 --> 01:02:13,210
Yeah.

2182
01:02:13,210 --> 01:02:14,043
I had a question.

2183
01:02:14,710 --> 01:02:15,280
Have you ever

2184
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:16,113
I thought a woman.

2185
01:02:16,490 --> 01:02:17,240
No,

2186
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:17,600
no.

2187
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:19,140
I sparred with them way,

2188
01:02:19,141 --> 01:02:19,351
way,

2189
01:02:19,351 --> 01:02:20,280
way back in the day

2190
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:21,360
and in taekwondo.

2191
01:02:21,510 --> 01:02:24,300
Never in kickboxing but in taekwondo
class sometimes you have to spar with them

2192
01:02:24,540 --> 01:02:25,440
but I never heard one.

2193
01:02:25,730 --> 01:02:27,850
Yeah I was playing basketball with linen.

2194
01:02:29,180 --> 01:02:29,830
Bet You do.

2195
01:02:29,830 --> 01:02:30,451
I really do.

2196
01:02:30,451 --> 01:02:31,500
Everybody gets sweaty.

2197
01:02:31,501 --> 01:02:32,334
People

2198
01:02:35,050 --> 01:02:38,380
will stay there right here and that's okay

2199
01:02:41,120 --> 01:02:43,840
while playing basketball and given that
cause we wouldn't have gotten a seven.

2200
01:02:44,350 --> 01:02:45,640
What did that come on?

2201
01:02:46,710 --> 01:02:48,780
Everybody chills out and
everyone just plays the,

2202
01:02:48,781 --> 01:02:52,200
I think it's kind of more
on your volleyball team in
the sense that people are

2203
01:02:52,201 --> 01:02:53,220
playing the game.

2204
01:02:53,221 --> 01:02:56,580
Then it's not about like I'm gonna
fucking elbow this gun type physical.

2205
01:02:56,690 --> 01:03:00,960
It's like people are actually
applying the techniques of basketball,

2206
01:03:00,961 --> 01:03:01,794
drama.

2207
01:03:02,920 --> 01:03:07,290
It's like when when dudes low in
general like extracurricular and I'm not

2208
01:03:07,291 --> 01:03:12,291
talking about martial arts and like
actual training that that you're involved

2209
01:03:12,391 --> 01:03:12,930
with.

2210
01:03:12,930 --> 01:03:15,270
My experience with extra curriculars,

2211
01:03:15,271 --> 01:03:18,750
sporting activities are kickball
and basketball and saws are huge.

2212
01:03:18,751 --> 01:03:19,380
My world.

2213
01:03:19,380 --> 01:03:24,380
It's amazing because people get so into
it and the ones that like get angry and

2214
01:03:25,831 --> 01:03:26,664
you're like,

2215
01:03:26,700 --> 01:03:27,840
we're here to have fun,

2216
01:03:27,930 --> 01:03:28,651
but at the same time,

2217
01:03:28,651 --> 01:03:31,710
that kind of sometimes also makes it more
fun because then there's that guy that

2218
01:03:31,711 --> 01:03:32,431
everybody did you like,

2219
01:03:32,431 --> 01:03:33,264
wow,

2220
01:03:33,390 --> 01:03:34,290
look at fucking,

2221
01:03:34,380 --> 01:03:35,310
I dunno Ted.

2222
01:03:35,340 --> 01:03:36,570
When we were in Boston,

2223
01:03:36,660 --> 01:03:38,590
we used to have a comedian softwheel man.

2224
01:03:39,540 --> 01:03:43,740
Every Monday we get together
and fucking yell at each other.

2225
01:03:43,741 --> 01:03:44,880
It was fucking safe.

2226
01:03:45,080 --> 01:03:46,530
Was screaming at each other over.

2227
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:49,261
Honey.

2228
01:03:49,261 --> 01:03:50,280
Honey is very athletic.

2229
01:03:50,281 --> 01:03:51,280
We love all sports.

2230
01:03:51,281 --> 01:03:52,740
So if you guys want to get down,

2231
01:03:52,770 --> 01:03:56,580
you guys throwing the gauntlet heavy bat.

2232
01:03:56,581 --> 01:03:57,414
You know what I'm saying?

2233
01:03:57,630 --> 01:04:02,340
Fucking road road kill goes choir right
now you'll be going back and forth.

2234
01:04:02,341 --> 01:04:03,174
So I'm on Twitter.

2235
01:04:04,550 --> 01:04:05,383
I'm going to show for us.

2236
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:05,731
Oh,

2237
01:04:05,731 --> 01:04:06,564
they're the

2238
01:04:08,810 --> 01:04:09,643
best.

2239
01:04:11,120 --> 01:04:11,820
It can be the best.

2240
01:04:11,820 --> 01:04:12,301
I really liked.

2241
01:04:12,301 --> 01:04:13,410
Those guys don't have a lot.

2242
01:04:13,540 --> 01:04:13,950
They're awesome.

2243
01:04:13,950 --> 01:04:14,880
They're fucking bad ass.

2244
01:04:14,881 --> 01:04:16,440
They sent me one of their cds.

2245
01:04:17,240 --> 01:04:18,073
It seems cool.

2246
01:04:24,020 --> 01:04:25,210
This is a hotel kid.

2247
01:04:25,470 --> 01:04:25,681
Fuck,

2248
01:04:25,681 --> 01:04:26,514
are you?

2249
01:04:28,300 --> 01:04:29,250
Is that a suggestion?

2250
01:04:29,700 --> 01:04:30,880
Is throw to that

2251
01:04:35,300 --> 01:04:36,133
dark

2252
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:43,620
[inaudible] we shouldn't be.

2253
01:04:43,621 --> 01:04:44,454
We shouldn't be

2254
01:04:45,850 --> 01:04:47,900
[inaudible] should,

2255
01:04:49,650 --> 01:04:50,131
first of all,

2256
01:04:50,131 --> 01:04:51,210
I did not mean to say that.

2257
01:04:51,211 --> 01:04:52,011
I think you did.

2258
01:04:52,011 --> 01:04:56,480
I [inaudible]

2259
01:04:58,230 --> 01:04:58,741
how much?

2260
01:04:58,741 --> 01:05:01,920
20% 20% sexy.

2261
01:05:02,370 --> 01:05:03,670
50% is confusing.

2262
01:05:05,810 --> 01:05:08,390
I'm 35 every few years.

2263
01:05:10,110 --> 01:05:11,820
Give a chicken drunk and sloppy kiss.

2264
01:05:11,821 --> 01:05:12,654
Yeah.

2265
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:14,580
Nothing wrong with that.

2266
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:17,100
No Man or not get granted.

2267
01:05:17,110 --> 01:05:17,530
Those,

2268
01:05:17,530 --> 01:05:18,100
those kind

2269
01:05:18,100 --> 01:05:18,933
gestures.

2270
01:05:19,220 --> 01:05:20,053
Go ahead.

2271
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:21,430
Go ahead and ask anyway.

2272
01:05:21,480 --> 01:05:22,250
Have you ever kissed a man?

2273
01:05:22,250 --> 01:05:23,083
Never.

2274
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:26,800
Do you want to Bruce?

2275
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:33,720
I did allow myself to Condo just
wondering about this Mick Jagger,

2276
01:05:34,330 --> 01:05:35,163
David Bowie Fan,

2277
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:36,420
and I was thinking,

2278
01:05:36,420 --> 01:05:37,253
okay,

2279
01:05:37,420 --> 01:05:38,253
okay,

2280
01:05:38,660 --> 01:05:42,660
maybe am I like really wrapped up
tight and connected to this idea,

2281
01:05:42,680 --> 01:05:44,560
not just of heterosexuality,

2282
01:05:44,770 --> 01:05:49,770
but of lifelong heterosexual
practice exclusively.

2283
01:05:50,420 --> 01:05:54,730
Like if I so wrapped up in that that I
couldn't like give a man a kiss and then

2284
01:05:54,731 --> 01:05:55,151
I was like,

2285
01:05:55,151 --> 01:05:56,590
you better shut the fuck up whole mall.

2286
01:05:58,900 --> 01:06:00,020
I said that to myself.

2287
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:01,570
You're trying to plant
these thoughts in my head.

2288
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:02,720
You asked yourself,

2289
01:06:02,780 --> 01:06:03,061
yes.

2290
01:06:03,061 --> 01:06:04,990
I gave that up because I was trying to,

2291
01:06:05,080 --> 01:06:05,741
I was wondering,

2292
01:06:05,741 --> 01:06:06,071
I was like,

2293
01:06:06,071 --> 01:06:06,300
okay,

2294
01:06:06,300 --> 01:06:07,480
look at these guys.

2295
01:06:07,720 --> 01:06:08,860
Like I always,

2296
01:06:09,010 --> 01:06:12,620
I do little things where I will try to um,

2297
01:06:14,110 --> 01:06:17,410
experience things or go places or put my,

2298
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:19,570
my mind or my consciousness in a,

2299
01:06:19,571 --> 01:06:24,550
in an unusual situation because I think
that when you have unusual experiences,

2300
01:06:24,730 --> 01:06:25,570
whether it's even,

2301
01:06:25,571 --> 01:06:29,380
even if you like watch unusual
DVDs or go to a strange place,

2302
01:06:29,560 --> 01:06:31,150
you take in new information,

2303
01:06:31,151 --> 01:06:34,150
that new information interacts with all
the other information in your head and

2304
01:06:34,151 --> 01:06:36,040
you form maybe new creative ideas.

2305
01:06:36,070 --> 01:06:36,670
So I think like,

2306
01:06:36,670 --> 01:06:38,050
as a person who tries to be creative,

2307
01:06:38,260 --> 01:06:40,960
it's good to have as many
experiences as possible.

2308
01:06:42,170 --> 01:06:43,003
Whoa.

2309
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,320
Certain line that I go,

2310
01:06:47,321 --> 01:06:48,610
I just don't think I could do that.

2311
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:50,740
And when I look at like
Mick Jagger and David Bowie,

2312
01:06:50,741 --> 01:06:52,030
I'm like a wonder if they were like,

2313
01:06:52,060 --> 01:06:52,990
fuck it.

2314
01:06:52,991 --> 01:06:54,460
Fuck everything man.

2315
01:06:54,820 --> 01:06:57,190
Fuck Homophobia.

2316
01:06:57,370 --> 01:06:57,940
Fuck,

2317
01:06:57,940 --> 01:06:58,721
I'm a man.

2318
01:06:58,721 --> 01:06:59,501
You're a man.

2319
01:06:59,501 --> 01:06:59,861
Fuck.

2320
01:06:59,861 --> 01:07:02,200
I'm only attracted to women.

2321
01:07:03,250 --> 01:07:07,090
Quintessential rock star with
a different spectrum than,

2322
01:07:07,091 --> 01:07:07,924
you know,

2323
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:08,571
maybe not,

2324
01:07:08,571 --> 01:07:09,090
not too,

2325
01:07:09,090 --> 01:07:10,170
I don't know you're being,

2326
01:07:10,190 --> 01:07:15,010
but it's drug induced delirium
and going through the,

2327
01:07:15,011 --> 01:07:15,490
you know,

2328
01:07:15,490 --> 01:07:18,640
I think those dudes at that time had,

2329
01:07:18,990 --> 01:07:20,680
had probably been through enough to say,

2330
01:07:21,470 --> 01:07:22,270
I've seen,

2331
01:07:22,270 --> 01:07:23,290
I've been to the limit.

2332
01:07:23,320 --> 01:07:23,621
You know,

2333
01:07:23,621 --> 01:07:23,830
I've,

2334
01:07:23,830 --> 01:07:25,420
I've seen the edge of the cliff debt,

2335
01:07:25,421 --> 01:07:26,620
but that's the old adage.

2336
01:07:26,621 --> 01:07:26,801
Like,

2337
01:07:26,801 --> 01:07:27,700
if you suck enough,

2338
01:07:27,870 --> 01:07:28,660
uh,

2339
01:07:28,660 --> 01:07:28,991
decks,

2340
01:07:28,991 --> 01:07:31,330
one day you're going to want
to have sex with a woman.

2341
01:07:31,960 --> 01:07:34,360
Like if a gay guy gets
to some breaking point,

2342
01:07:35,730 --> 01:07:36,790
hundred million,

2343
01:07:36,791 --> 01:07:37,960
Dickson is acid mouth.

2344
01:07:37,960 --> 01:07:38,201
He's like,

2345
01:07:38,201 --> 01:07:41,980
you enough blizzard of
Dick Knopf please a woman.

2346
01:07:42,190 --> 01:07:42,371
Well,

2347
01:07:42,371 --> 01:07:43,204
it doesn't happen,

2348
01:07:43,240 --> 01:07:43,680
but,

2349
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:45,430
but does it happen the
other way where a man,

2350
01:07:45,431 --> 01:07:49,750
a straight man has so many different
female partners at one day he knew

2351
01:07:51,700 --> 01:07:52,533
they fucked.

2352
01:07:53,470 --> 01:07:54,970
I want to be the guy that says,

2353
01:07:55,360 --> 01:07:58,120
I want to be the guy that
says it a little spoon.

2354
01:07:58,190 --> 01:07:59,023
It says something.

2355
01:07:59,110 --> 01:08:02,350
If you're lying on someone's shoulder
and they put their arm around like that,

2356
01:08:02,380 --> 01:08:04,300
what you do is you reach
up with the left arm,

2357
01:08:04,420 --> 01:08:05,500
you protect the neck.

2358
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:06,580
It's very important.

2359
01:08:08,210 --> 01:08:09,670
Is that something like this?

2360
01:08:10,430 --> 01:08:11,201
You want to do it like this?

2361
01:08:11,201 --> 01:08:13,540
You want to cop it and
don't let go of that wrist.

2362
01:08:13,541 --> 01:08:14,770
Pin it down to your chest.

2363
01:08:14,771 --> 01:08:15,290
Dead.

2364
01:08:15,290 --> 01:08:16,040
You gotta you

2365
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:16,790
got shrimp out.

2366
01:08:16,790 --> 01:08:20,770
I know you guys know about Hashtag
Hashtag [inaudible] me about

2367
01:08:23,360 --> 01:08:23,670
the show.

2368
01:08:23,670 --> 01:08:25,500
Sometimes people will just be like Ben.

2369
01:08:27,900 --> 01:08:28,950
So funny.

2370
01:08:31,010 --> 01:08:31,843
What a

2371
01:08:32,990 --> 01:08:35,570
beautiful part of our history here,

2372
01:08:35,571 --> 01:08:35,871
Joe.

2373
01:08:35,871 --> 01:08:36,570
That's Lou Reed.

2374
01:08:36,570 --> 01:08:37,403
Wasn't that Lou Reed?

2375
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:38,713
Was He cussing

2376
01:08:43,490 --> 01:08:45,260
David Bowie's God net or Steve Gutenberg?

2377
01:08:45,470 --> 01:08:46,090
David Boggs.

2378
01:08:46,090 --> 01:08:47,200
Goddamn free

2379
01:08:48,760 --> 01:08:49,593
town.

2380
01:08:49,910 --> 01:08:51,190
He's the man dude.

2381
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:53,390
Ground control to major Tom.

2382
01:08:53,810 --> 01:08:57,580
That is the optimum for great songs.

2383
01:08:57,590 --> 01:08:58,041
Him Shit.

2384
01:08:58,041 --> 01:09:00,400
I'm talking about control major time.

2385
01:09:00,410 --> 01:09:02,060
What are adorable?

2386
01:09:03,320 --> 01:09:04,153
So cute.

2387
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:07,730
Matching t shirts.

2388
01:09:07,731 --> 01:09:08,660
I didn't know.

2389
01:09:10,460 --> 01:09:11,930
I didn't get my penguin package

2390
01:09:13,810 --> 01:09:16,520
when your kids and people would
have like fake alligator shirts,

2391
01:09:16,580 --> 01:09:18,260
they would take some of our stuff,

2392
01:09:18,300 --> 01:09:20,630
but you're not sure to big blue going out.

2393
01:09:20,631 --> 01:09:21,490
I want you to shit

2394
01:09:24,030 --> 01:09:27,920
[inaudible] relevant and
important to this podcast.

2395
01:09:28,220 --> 01:09:31,040
You have a listener and
made us a piece of artwork.

2396
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:31,700
You say,

2397
01:09:31,700 --> 01:09:32,450
well look,

2398
01:09:32,450 --> 01:09:34,400
we've treated him with
the utmost legal respect.

2399
01:09:34,401 --> 01:09:35,234
I'm not even kidding.

2400
01:09:35,340 --> 01:09:35,690
He,

2401
01:09:35,690 --> 01:09:36,440
he did.

2402
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:37,290
He made to bill.

2403
01:09:37,291 --> 01:09:38,290
His name is Bill Patterson.

2404
01:09:38,570 --> 01:09:39,110
Um,

2405
01:09:39,110 --> 01:09:44,110
and he put $2 bills and put are there
ones made shirts out of that dude,

2406
01:09:44,721 --> 01:09:45,700
that's like our emerge.

2407
01:09:51,070 --> 01:09:53,340
We live in the same town now.

2408
01:09:54,390 --> 01:09:55,223
Fine.

2409
01:09:55,240 --> 01:09:56,870
You guys aren't living until
you don't have apartments.

2410
01:09:56,871 --> 01:09:57,704
Do you?

2411
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:04,560
When are we going hunting all the
time and you want to shoot now?

2412
01:10:04,860 --> 01:10:05,693
What do you want

2413
01:10:10,520 --> 01:10:11,020
honey?

2414
01:10:11,020 --> 01:10:11,853
Honey,

2415
01:10:11,870 --> 01:10:12,140
honey,

2416
01:10:12,140 --> 01:10:13,220
honey goes pig hunting.

2417
01:10:14,090 --> 01:10:14,923
Wild pig hunting.

2418
01:10:15,230 --> 01:10:16,940
We have the most likelihood of success.

2419
01:10:16,941 --> 01:10:18,080
Like if anything that we could do,

2420
01:10:18,130 --> 01:10:18,341
you know,

2421
01:10:18,341 --> 01:10:19,400
like a close rate.

2422
01:10:19,430 --> 01:10:20,540
But we have to take you guys,

2423
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:21,620
have you shot rifles before

2424
01:10:25,030 --> 01:10:27,350
with two fingers in the
same trigger brother.

2425
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:28,593
I'm just kidding.

2426
01:10:33,700 --> 01:10:33,971
No,

2427
01:10:33,971 --> 01:10:34,804
but uh,

2428
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:37,610
and I mistakenly thought it was,

2429
01:10:37,611 --> 01:10:38,444
you have the,

2430
01:10:38,900 --> 01:10:41,330
my friend Cameron Hanes
drawing a bow on a nail,

2431
01:10:41,510 --> 01:10:44,540
but it really made me think the caption
underneath it because it was talking

2432
01:10:44,541 --> 01:10:47,960
about the practice and the discipline
that it took to be able to make that shot

2433
01:10:47,961 --> 01:10:50,450
and not hit the deer
and the fucking paunch.

2434
01:10:50,451 --> 01:10:52,580
So it's crippled for the rest of his life.

2435
01:10:52,581 --> 01:10:53,414
But not dead.

2436
01:10:53,540 --> 01:10:55,550
And that gave me a new
respect for housing honestly,

2437
01:10:55,551 --> 01:10:56,061
because I was like,

2438
01:10:56,061 --> 01:10:59,050
I don't want to go out there
and and shoot something and

2439
01:11:00,990 --> 01:11:01,770
no,

2440
01:11:01,770 --> 01:11:02,750
it's not about trophy hunting.

2441
01:11:02,751 --> 01:11:07,130
It's about not being a good enough shot
or not being skilled enough to be able

2442
01:11:07,131 --> 01:11:09,500
to kill the animal in a humane way.

2443
01:11:09,680 --> 01:11:10,490
Well,

2444
01:11:10,490 --> 01:11:14,310
it is possible if you go out
hunting that you could miss

2445
01:11:14,730 --> 01:11:16,140
and cam has missed.

2446
01:11:16,141 --> 01:11:17,190
Cameron Hanes has missed.

2447
01:11:17,200 --> 01:11:20,250
Steven Rinella is my friend
who's a master hunter.

2448
01:11:20,251 --> 01:11:22,830
He has missed and they
have all wounded animals.

2449
01:11:22,860 --> 01:11:24,900
It is a part of the process.

2450
01:11:24,930 --> 01:11:26,910
If you deny that part of the process,

2451
01:11:27,150 --> 01:11:28,290
you're being dishonest.

2452
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:28,770
Sure.

2453
01:11:28,770 --> 01:11:33,770
But you need to practice due diligence
to make sure that you minimize that and

2454
01:11:33,811 --> 01:11:36,550
as much as is possible and can.

2455
01:11:36,570 --> 01:11:40,230
Haynes post was about my friend Cameron
Hanes is a world famous bow hunter.

2456
01:11:40,350 --> 01:11:41,540
I mean there's very few bow,

2457
01:11:41,541 --> 01:11:42,361
hundreds of world famous,

2458
01:11:42,361 --> 01:11:43,290
but he's a maniac.

2459
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:44,880
He runs ultra marathons.

2460
01:11:44,990 --> 01:11:45,630
Okay.

2461
01:11:45,630 --> 01:11:46,650
Regularly runs marathons.

2462
01:11:46,651 --> 01:11:47,940
He's run two marathons in a weekend.

2463
01:11:47,941 --> 01:11:49,260
He's running like a Friday marathon.

2464
01:11:49,710 --> 01:11:50,580
Is that the end of the world?

2465
01:11:50,680 --> 01:11:52,290
It could be here it goes.

2466
01:11:52,710 --> 01:11:53,640
What the fuck is that?

2467
01:11:53,730 --> 01:11:54,840
That's up to be a fighter jet.

2468
01:11:56,700 --> 01:11:57,660
Holy Shit.

2469
01:11:57,661 --> 01:11:58,590
Happy to be with you guys.

2470
01:11:58,860 --> 01:12:00,450
That's a really loud and the bunker.

2471
01:12:01,290 --> 01:12:02,630
Is that the Ebola plane?

2472
01:12:03,400 --> 01:12:05,070
What the fuck was that?

2473
01:12:05,160 --> 01:12:06,040
So we're uh,

2474
01:12:06,060 --> 01:12:06,900
we're sitting here.

2475
01:12:06,940 --> 01:12:08,760
That red man was doing
something weird and it,

2476
01:12:08,910 --> 01:12:09,780
it almost sound,

2477
01:12:09,781 --> 01:12:11,700
it's so loud like a jet.

2478
01:12:11,730 --> 01:12:12,960
It sounded like a,

2479
01:12:13,860 --> 01:12:16,740
that was right at a fucking jet
was going to crash and Canoga Park.

2480
01:12:16,770 --> 01:12:18,270
Hey if this is it right now,

2481
01:12:18,520 --> 01:12:20,640
like getting the love you guys too.

2482
01:12:21,540 --> 01:12:23,760
I mean that this is okay.

2483
01:12:24,540 --> 01:12:26,730
Talking about meteor
impacts on the show lately.

2484
01:12:27,240 --> 01:12:28,073
Yeah.

2485
01:12:28,380 --> 01:12:30,960
Brian Callen and I got
obsessed with me your impacts.

2486
01:12:30,961 --> 01:12:32,010
We were on Prince of Wales.

2487
01:12:32,011 --> 01:12:37,011
We started talking about all the various
media impacts and super volcanoes that

2488
01:12:38,041 --> 01:12:40,200
have happened over the
past x amount of years.

2489
01:12:40,260 --> 01:12:40,990
Brian's back.

2490
01:12:40,990 --> 01:12:42,760
Anytime you get any info with the Intel,

2491
01:12:43,860 --> 01:12:45,880
start checking the news sites.

2492
01:12:45,881 --> 01:12:46,630
What do you think?

2493
01:12:46,630 --> 01:12:50,050
Top Gun jets flying car radio.

2494
01:12:50,100 --> 01:12:51,100
Obama's in town.

2495
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:54,701
It's mayhem.

2496
01:12:54,701 --> 01:12:56,050
They came to get me him

2497
01:12:57,650 --> 01:12:58,720
cause he was here yesterday.

2498
01:12:58,760 --> 01:12:59,181
I don't know.

2499
01:12:59,181 --> 01:13:00,110
Maybe he left today.

2500
01:13:00,170 --> 01:13:01,610
He said I'm one of those fucking jets.

2501
01:13:01,970 --> 01:13:02,540
I Dunno.

2502
01:13:02,540 --> 01:13:03,950
Find out I'm sad.

2503
01:13:03,951 --> 01:13:04,784
No.

2504
01:13:07,830 --> 01:13:09,120
Do you have enough snacks?

2505
01:13:13,270 --> 01:13:16,800
If we can get the fucking Taliban in the
same room and give them some hash and

2506
01:13:16,801 --> 01:13:17,581
we all eat it together.

2507
01:13:17,581 --> 01:13:19,200
We could work this motherfucker out.

2508
01:13:22,770 --> 01:13:23,603
Musical part.

2509
01:13:24,650 --> 01:13:26,280
What's going to happen is
we're going to read that.

2510
01:13:26,310 --> 01:13:29,070
It's going to be the end of the world
and we only have like five minutes left

2511
01:13:29,071 --> 01:13:30,900
and then you two are gonna
kiss and it's going to be June.

2512
01:13:31,260 --> 01:13:36,260
Me And Ben or me and Suzanne
[inaudible] since this is it.

2513
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:42,000
If this is our last time here on earth,

2514
01:13:42,001 --> 01:13:43,710
Brian will you please say world?

2515
01:13:44,090 --> 01:13:44,660
Oh Art.

2516
01:13:44,660 --> 01:13:46,440
Thank you Carl.

2517
01:13:46,620 --> 01:13:48,510
He says Derby r l l

2518
01:13:51,230 --> 01:13:52,390
were old.

2519
01:13:52,770 --> 01:13:53,490
Ps,

2520
01:13:53,490 --> 01:13:54,271
if it's the end,

2521
01:13:54,271 --> 01:13:56,600
you could say world once
you know how to say.

2522
01:13:57,490 --> 01:13:57,691
Yeah,

2523
01:13:57,691 --> 01:13:58,320
that wasn't good.

2524
01:13:58,320 --> 01:13:59,040
That was weird.

2525
01:13:59,040 --> 01:13:59,880
It was so loud.

2526
01:14:00,090 --> 01:14:01,410
We're inside of a building,

2527
01:14:01,710 --> 01:14:03,960
you know like a pretty thick
ass fucking regular ones.

2528
01:14:03,970 --> 01:14:04,970
I was going to be outside.

2529
01:14:05,490 --> 01:14:06,323
Everyone's outside.

2530
01:14:08,300 --> 01:14:09,420
That's why we should really job.

2531
01:14:10,240 --> 01:14:10,550
Yeah.

2532
01:14:10,550 --> 01:14:11,050
Okay.

2533
01:14:11,050 --> 01:14:12,070
Is it what?

2534
01:14:12,070 --> 01:14:13,390
Anybody catch anything?

2535
01:14:13,450 --> 01:14:15,760
I guarantee it's just some
people fucking showing off.

2536
01:14:16,150 --> 01:14:16,940
Oh my God.

2537
01:14:16,940 --> 01:14:18,640
Probably jerking off while
they're flying really low.

2538
01:14:19,310 --> 01:14:19,720
Quit.

2539
01:14:19,720 --> 01:14:20,620
Quit this fucking job.

2540
01:14:21,160 --> 01:14:22,770
What's the best way he got to Jericho?

2541
01:14:22,840 --> 01:14:24,310
Jerk jerk off while you're flying.

2542
01:14:24,311 --> 01:14:25,330
Go a thousand miles an hour,

2543
01:14:25,331 --> 01:14:26,330
15 feet off the ground

2544
01:14:29,180 --> 01:14:30,013
pressure.

2545
01:14:30,070 --> 01:14:30,903
I could do it.

2546
01:14:31,420 --> 01:14:31,541
Well,

2547
01:14:31,541 --> 01:14:32,890
you didn't need all calm and it's like,

2548
01:14:32,891 --> 01:14:33,724
at least you can say you

2549
01:14:35,930 --> 01:14:36,850
do it then it's not.

2550
01:14:36,870 --> 01:14:38,440
Most people won't even
question any further.

2551
01:14:38,441 --> 01:14:40,840
I was jerking off in a jet
15 feet off the ground,

2552
01:14:40,841 --> 01:14:42,010
going a thousand miles an hour.

2553
01:14:42,940 --> 01:14:43,773
Was Your Dick hard?

2554
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:44,833
Why you asking me?

2555
01:14:46,530 --> 01:14:49,180
All you have to do is just start pulling
on your Dick and technically speaking,

2556
01:14:49,181 --> 01:14:50,014
you were checking

2557
01:14:55,210 --> 01:14:57,060
out and really,

2558
01:14:57,220 --> 01:14:58,990
really going to town to be jerking off.

2559
01:14:59,030 --> 01:14:59,980
That's not true though,

2560
01:14:59,981 --> 01:15:03,010
because you know a penis that's
a man can be three quarters hard,

2561
01:15:03,011 --> 01:15:07,620
half hard and still have
the saddest orgasm of shame.

2562
01:15:08,680 --> 01:15:09,550
I know what you're talking about.

2563
01:15:10,090 --> 01:15:12,940
Fucking many orgasms too
and it's like I was okay,

2564
01:15:13,710 --> 01:15:14,543
but it's not shame.

2565
01:15:15,490 --> 01:15:17,050
Shame is the feeling of guilt,

2566
01:15:17,051 --> 01:15:17,410
man.

2567
01:15:17,410 --> 01:15:18,243
Here's the difference.

2568
01:15:18,310 --> 01:15:21,100
If a girl calls up a friend that's a guy,

2569
01:15:21,400 --> 01:15:23,860
say of girl calls up a boyfriend and says,

2570
01:15:24,210 --> 01:15:24,620
oh,

2571
01:15:24,620 --> 01:15:25,540
I'll just masturbating.

2572
01:15:25,541 --> 01:15:27,100
I had like a half an orgasm,

2573
01:15:27,550 --> 01:15:28,390
the guy will go,

2574
01:15:28,480 --> 01:15:30,250
I'll come over and take care of that.

2575
01:15:30,350 --> 01:15:35,350
[inaudible]

2576
01:15:37,130 --> 01:15:38,210
it sounds like a vocal fry.

2577
01:15:39,980 --> 01:15:41,190
A girl has sex with him.

2578
01:15:41,191 --> 01:15:41,680
He goes,

2579
01:15:41,680 --> 01:15:43,060
I couldn't even totally get it up.

2580
01:15:43,061 --> 01:15:44,320
I just came home myself.

2581
01:15:45,180 --> 01:15:47,170
The girl be like the girl,

2582
01:15:47,180 --> 01:15:47,531
be like,

2583
01:15:47,531 --> 01:15:48,364
click

2584
01:15:50,300 --> 01:15:50,591
no.

2585
01:15:50,591 --> 01:15:51,071
I'd be like,

2586
01:15:51,071 --> 01:15:52,360
do you want to watch a movie?

2587
01:15:52,860 --> 01:15:53,410
Be like,

2588
01:15:53,410 --> 01:15:55,960
do you want to just
spoon that breaking bad?

2589
01:15:57,600 --> 01:15:58,600
What?

2590
01:15:58,960 --> 01:15:59,770
That's so hot.

2591
01:15:59,770 --> 01:16:00,603
Say it again.

2592
01:16:02,730 --> 01:16:03,190
Yeah,

2593
01:16:03,190 --> 01:16:03,990
Ya.

2594
01:16:03,990 --> 01:16:05,320
You guys think we're okay.

2595
01:16:06,260 --> 01:16:08,740
We know the world.

2596
01:16:08,741 --> 01:16:10,360
We were just talking about noncoding

2597
01:16:12,460 --> 01:16:15,790
big beaten down by this fucking stupid
system that's been in place since we were

2598
01:16:15,791 --> 01:16:16,624
babies.

2599
01:16:16,930 --> 01:16:18,610
We didn't ask for this stupid system.

2600
01:16:18,611 --> 01:16:19,570
We were born into it.

2601
01:16:19,870 --> 01:16:21,130
This goofy ass system,

2602
01:16:21,220 --> 01:16:22,200
but how do we want him ease?

2603
01:16:22,270 --> 01:16:24,850
How do we work our way out
of it without being involved?

2604
01:16:25,100 --> 01:16:26,510
We'll get bench some world.

2605
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:27,071
Hold on.

2606
01:16:27,071 --> 01:16:28,960
I have a yellow notepad and
I'm going to take notes.

2607
01:16:29,070 --> 01:16:30,140
This is what I honestly think.

2608
01:16:30,150 --> 01:16:31,150
I don't think it's happening.

2609
01:16:31,151 --> 01:16:32,080
Whether we like it or not.

2610
01:16:32,081 --> 01:16:34,900
It just takes a lot of time
and it's very confusing.

2611
01:16:34,930 --> 01:16:36,250
It's very confusing along the way.

2612
01:16:36,251 --> 01:16:37,061
And we're in the middle of it.

2613
01:16:37,061 --> 01:16:37,960
It's a hurricane.

2614
01:16:38,230 --> 01:16:41,620
We're in the middle of the storm
and we've taken this crazy weather,

2615
01:16:41,770 --> 01:16:44,080
fucking cows and semis
flying through the air.

2616
01:16:44,081 --> 01:16:45,310
We've taken as being normal.

2617
01:16:45,720 --> 01:16:46,553
The movie twister.

2618
01:16:46,690 --> 01:16:47,523
No,

2619
01:16:47,590 --> 01:16:49,130
I sort of did visually,

2620
01:16:49,810 --> 01:16:51,010
visually in my mind,

2621
01:16:51,011 --> 01:16:53,140
I was thinking about a film news footage.

2622
01:16:53,720 --> 01:16:58,200
One of the most impressive news videos
I ever saw was this Dallas video we

2623
01:16:58,210 --> 01:17:01,600
played on the podcast of these semi
trailers in a tornado that we're flying

2624
01:17:01,601 --> 01:17:04,160
through the air just spinning
around in the air like the road,

2625
01:17:04,161 --> 01:17:05,260
like paper cups.

2626
01:17:05,590 --> 01:17:06,820
And they were semis like,

2627
01:17:06,821 --> 01:17:06,971
just,

2628
01:17:06,971 --> 01:17:10,280
just terrified that seen like the fucking

2629
01:17:10,280 --> 01:17:11,930
miraculous thing that the ocean,

2630
01:17:12,110 --> 01:17:12,670
yeah,

2631
01:17:12,670 --> 01:17:12,800
yeah.

2632
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:13,101
Got You.

2633
01:17:13,101 --> 01:17:14,810
To donate your gives zero fucks.

2634
01:17:14,830 --> 01:17:14,981
So,

2635
01:17:14,981 --> 01:17:15,890
so I have an idea.

2636
01:17:16,220 --> 01:17:16,910
I have an idea.

2637
01:17:16,910 --> 01:17:17,930
Please allow,

2638
01:17:18,180 --> 01:17:19,510
write it down about the,

2639
01:17:19,511 --> 01:17:19,970
um,

2640
01:17:19,970 --> 01:17:20,230
the,

2641
01:17:20,230 --> 01:17:25,040
the subject matter that
I'm writing it down.

2642
01:17:25,340 --> 01:17:26,630
So I think,

2643
01:17:26,670 --> 01:17:27,503
um,

2644
01:17:28,070 --> 01:17:31,030
the world is in a crazy place
as we were discussing and yes.

2645
01:17:31,260 --> 01:17:32,093
Um,

2646
01:17:32,120 --> 01:17:32,720
you know,

2647
01:17:32,720 --> 01:17:33,920
there are people that are really,

2648
01:17:33,921 --> 01:17:34,281
really,

2649
01:17:34,281 --> 01:17:38,740
really fucking smart intellectually
can analyze and overanalyze and,

2650
01:17:38,741 --> 01:17:41,570
and just inside out Ben's
right there and like,

2651
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:41,811
well,

2652
01:17:41,811 --> 01:17:44,870
and might just call it
what it is and say it.

2653
01:17:44,900 --> 01:17:45,733
You know,

2654
01:17:46,140 --> 01:17:46,490
Ben?

2655
01:17:46,490 --> 01:17:46,691
No,

2656
01:17:46,691 --> 01:17:46,910
Ben,

2657
01:17:46,910 --> 01:17:48,860
you're fucking brilliant
motherfucker and I love you.

2658
01:17:48,861 --> 01:17:50,030
I'm so glad you're my partner.

2659
01:17:51,410 --> 01:17:52,200
Okay.

2660
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:53,033
All right.

2661
01:17:53,510 --> 01:17:54,650
We're having a good time.

2662
01:17:54,920 --> 01:17:55,700
But um,

2663
01:17:55,700 --> 01:17:56,130
but yeah,

2664
01:17:56,130 --> 01:17:56,963
you know,

2665
01:17:58,320 --> 01:17:59,510
he's got his issues.

2666
01:17:59,540 --> 01:18:00,373
Let's be honest.

2667
01:18:04,320 --> 01:18:04,660
Great,

2668
01:18:04,660 --> 01:18:05,493
great.

2669
01:18:07,050 --> 01:18:08,330
Bringing yourself down.

2670
01:18:08,340 --> 01:18:09,660
Just say Mako peanuts.

2671
01:18:09,661 --> 01:18:11,070
Micro micro

2672
01:18:13,710 --> 01:18:14,280
precision.

2673
01:18:14,280 --> 01:18:14,491
No,

2674
01:18:14,491 --> 01:18:15,324
it's not.

2675
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:19,440
It's not a lot of precision involved
when you're caught in a sleeve.

2676
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:20,753
Okay.

2677
01:18:20,980 --> 01:18:21,790
What is it?

2678
01:18:21,790 --> 01:18:22,623
What part of this?

2679
01:18:22,920 --> 01:18:23,930
That's what I was tours.

2680
01:18:24,510 --> 01:18:25,170
Focus.

2681
01:18:25,170 --> 01:18:26,340
Joke has Ben's Jewish,

2682
01:18:26,341 --> 01:18:31,341
no vagina being physical sleep and sleep
hood with that difference that envelops

2683
01:18:32,071 --> 01:18:32,904
the penis.

2684
01:18:32,970 --> 01:18:33,630
That's all I'm saying.

2685
01:18:33,630 --> 01:18:34,141
Hold on now.

2686
01:18:34,141 --> 01:18:35,520
I really do need to
write this down to penis.

2687
01:18:35,521 --> 01:18:37,380
Goes inside.

2688
01:18:37,710 --> 01:18:37,831
Well,

2689
01:18:37,831 --> 01:18:39,300
you can go out

2690
01:18:41,870 --> 01:18:43,980
is really good at it.

2691
01:18:44,270 --> 01:18:45,470
I think in the crying.

2692
01:18:45,720 --> 01:18:46,560
He can't spit.

2693
01:18:46,570 --> 01:18:47,730
Not everyone's mouth.

2694
01:18:48,900 --> 01:18:49,920
Try It on everyone.

2695
01:18:50,140 --> 01:18:51,760
You got to know you're
going to need to be proven.

2696
01:18:51,790 --> 01:18:53,820
It's like terrible joke.

2697
01:18:53,970 --> 01:18:56,910
You have to know when he can get away
with it and you don't know why you'd know.

2698
01:18:56,911 --> 01:18:57,721
But you do know.

2699
01:18:57,721 --> 01:19:01,680
You know mom about this podcast when a
girl sticks her tongue out and you just

2700
01:19:01,681 --> 01:19:03,940
spit on it and she swallows it.

2701
01:19:05,060 --> 01:19:07,710
This party is about to
get fucking serious,

2702
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:09,720
which she doesn't even flinch.

2703
01:19:11,970 --> 01:19:16,650
You just spit in her mouth and she
just reaches her head up and tons.

2704
01:19:16,651 --> 01:19:17,484
You and Whoa,

2705
01:19:18,120 --> 01:19:21,900
I know I'm about to get some double
penetration gave believe you spit in her

2706
01:19:21,901 --> 01:19:23,460
mouth and you can't even believe that.

2707
01:19:23,461 --> 01:19:25,730
She just swallowed it to let
you know how gangster shit.

2708
01:19:25,770 --> 01:19:25,951
No,

2709
01:19:25,951 --> 01:19:27,210
there's a camera in that room.

2710
01:19:27,240 --> 01:19:27,481
No,

2711
01:19:27,481 --> 01:19:27,830
no,

2712
01:19:27,830 --> 01:19:28,663
no.

2713
01:19:29,030 --> 01:19:29,780
You gotta go there.

2714
01:19:29,780 --> 01:19:30,613
I don't know why.

2715
01:19:30,650 --> 01:19:31,060
Why did,

2716
01:19:31,060 --> 01:19:32,940
why did you have to take
the beauty out of it?

2717
01:19:33,510 --> 01:19:36,480
I would just want to capture it QUT
and spitting in people's mouths.

2718
01:19:36,810 --> 01:19:38,040
Tate's bit in someone's mouth.

2719
01:19:38,260 --> 01:19:38,730
You there?

2720
01:19:38,730 --> 01:19:39,421
Remember that time.

2721
01:19:39,421 --> 01:19:40,920
Barris gets it almost once a week,

2722
01:19:42,680 --> 01:19:47,610
like really deep and sensitive teeth
is a complete and total savage.

2723
01:19:47,640 --> 01:19:48,151
Oh Gee.

2724
01:19:48,151 --> 01:19:50,220
Savage original desk squad cru.

2725
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:52,090
Tate is an animal and uh,

2726
01:19:52,140 --> 01:19:54,930
he was making out with this girl
once and she goes spit in my mouth.

2727
01:19:54,930 --> 01:19:57,000
He just kills her hair
back and fucking spits.

2728
01:19:57,001 --> 01:19:57,360
Right.

2729
01:19:57,360 --> 01:19:58,830
Are we talking in front of everybody?

2730
01:19:59,070 --> 01:20:01,120
I didn't look around happening again.

2731
01:20:02,040 --> 01:20:02,873
Do we run outside?

2732
01:20:03,150 --> 01:20:03,983
Jamie just ran out.

2733
01:20:04,310 --> 01:20:05,310
Jamie bringing a camera.

2734
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:06,233
Yeah.

2735
01:20:06,300 --> 01:20:07,440
Brian ran to,

2736
01:20:07,470 --> 01:20:08,820
what the fuck is going on?

2737
01:20:09,450 --> 01:20:11,520
Is this to naval base?

2738
01:20:11,521 --> 01:20:14,820
I don't think this is that
big of a deal where we are.

2739
01:20:15,720 --> 01:20:16,620
Here's the problem.

2740
01:20:16,621 --> 01:20:17,460
White privilege.

2741
01:20:19,110 --> 01:20:23,340
We're sitting here and fucking Canoga
park thinking about what's going

2742
01:20:23,410 --> 01:20:24,000
privilege.

2743
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:24,121
I,

2744
01:20:24,121 --> 01:20:24,954
me too.

2745
01:20:25,350 --> 01:20:26,183
Me Too.

2746
01:20:26,310 --> 01:20:27,720
Christine trainor jets going over.

2747
01:20:27,721 --> 01:20:29,500
That doesn't have anything
to do with breath,

2748
01:20:29,570 --> 01:20:30,000
bro.

2749
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,460
I'm kind of keeping in Russia
and it's all gonna make sense.

2750
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:38,000
What I'm saying is we look
at war as something that
happens in another place and

2751
01:20:38,521 --> 01:20:39,510
we support war.

2752
01:20:39,511 --> 01:20:40,660
If we do support war,

2753
01:20:42,200 --> 01:20:44,610
it has to come anywhere near us.

2754
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:46,890
We never think that it has
to come anywhere near us.

2755
01:20:46,980 --> 01:20:47,813
We just don't.

2756
01:20:47,820 --> 01:20:49,500
We think that it's happening in Iraq.

2757
01:20:49,710 --> 01:20:51,030
It's happened in Afghanistan.

2758
01:20:51,031 --> 01:20:53,230
It's been happening there for tow.

2759
01:20:53,240 --> 01:20:54,900
Well fucking years.

2760
01:20:55,080 --> 01:20:55,913
More than that.

2761
01:20:56,250 --> 01:20:59,410
Thousands of years with us now.

2762
01:21:00,050 --> 01:21:01,200
He's going to make sure it's okay.

2763
01:21:01,800 --> 01:21:02,011
Well,

2764
01:21:02,011 --> 01:21:05,370
he is one of the best investigative
reporters and the Los Angeles area.

2765
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:08,240
So prior to the world,

2766
01:21:09,350 --> 01:21:10,710
Brian Band is on the case.

2767
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:12,030
He's out there smoking a cigarette.

2768
01:21:12,270 --> 01:21:13,360
He's going to come back inside.

2769
01:21:13,361 --> 01:21:13,831
It's going to go.

2770
01:21:13,831 --> 01:21:14,740
I was looking at it.

2771
01:21:15,300 --> 01:21:16,133
Of course he is.

2772
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:17,461
Of course he is.

2773
01:21:17,461 --> 01:21:18,300
He can't help himself.

2774
01:21:18,390 --> 01:21:19,223
He's a junkie.

2775
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:20,333
Poor bastard.

2776
01:21:20,990 --> 01:21:22,500
You don't need to do this vape pen.

2777
01:21:22,530 --> 01:21:22,951
Don't work.

2778
01:21:22,951 --> 01:21:24,450
Do you want to go out there
with them and smoke cigarettes

2779
01:21:26,280 --> 01:21:28,590
and I quit my vape pens

2780
01:21:32,440 --> 01:21:35,100
is that might be fucking
RJ Reynolds propaganda,

2781
01:21:35,220 --> 01:21:35,671
whatever.

2782
01:21:35,671 --> 01:21:36,361
I feel fine.

2783
01:21:36,361 --> 01:21:37,350
I don't smoke them anymore.

2784
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:39,360
No,

2785
01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:42,090
I definitely felt more like tension.

2786
01:21:42,570 --> 01:21:43,350
Let you,

2787
01:21:43,350 --> 01:21:44,183
cause I

2788
01:21:45,350 --> 01:21:47,070
taking taken the yoga,

2789
01:21:48,020 --> 01:21:48,853
the yoga.

2790
01:21:49,430 --> 01:21:51,330
I feel so at peace and I'm so happy.

2791
01:21:51,810 --> 01:21:52,411
I'm serious.

2792
01:21:52,411 --> 01:21:53,340
Yoga is so good.

2793
01:21:53,610 --> 01:21:54,391
So good.

2794
01:21:54,391 --> 01:21:55,230
Whenever I do what I go,

2795
01:21:55,231 --> 01:21:55,741
God damn,

2796
01:21:55,741 --> 01:21:56,700
I should do this more often.

2797
01:21:57,320 --> 01:21:58,270
What kind of Yoga you do?

2798
01:21:59,310 --> 01:22:00,450
I do a bunch of different times,

2799
01:22:00,451 --> 01:22:03,670
but fucking shit about beat crumbs.

2800
01:22:03,900 --> 01:22:04,720
Well,

2801
01:22:04,720 --> 01:22:06,780
it's like calling it hot yoga
because apparently I'm not,

2802
01:22:06,781 --> 01:22:08,580
I don't even feel bad
saying this beak room.

2803
01:22:08,740 --> 01:22:10,620
The Guy who developed this,

2804
01:22:10,650 --> 01:22:10,860
uh,

2805
01:22:10,860 --> 01:22:11,641
this brand,

2806
01:22:11,641 --> 01:22:16,450
which is a series of poses and he kind
of took for himself as his zone is a

2807
01:22:16,470 --> 01:22:17,303
Douche.

2808
01:22:17,400 --> 01:22:18,233
Like,

2809
01:22:19,830 --> 01:22:20,820
I don't know.

2810
01:22:20,880 --> 01:22:21,440
I don't know.

2811
01:22:21,440 --> 01:22:23,430
He's just going to give you enlightenment
through the head of his penis.

2812
01:22:23,660 --> 01:22:24,493
Okay.

2813
01:22:24,880 --> 01:22:26,220
Everybody has a different method.

2814
01:22:26,221 --> 01:22:29,220
Some have Koana like what is
the sound of one hand clapping?

2815
01:22:29,221 --> 01:22:31,110
Any more offensive than
him trying to fuck you.

2816
01:22:32,360 --> 01:22:33,193
Yes.

2817
01:22:34,240 --> 01:22:35,640
Go ahead and answer that competently.

2818
01:22:35,660 --> 01:22:36,660
He just said yes.

2819
01:22:37,140 --> 01:22:38,490
You said it's more offensive.

2820
01:22:38,520 --> 01:22:41,290
More the sound of one hand
clapping is more offensive.

2821
01:22:41,630 --> 01:22:42,120
Fuck,

2822
01:22:42,120 --> 01:22:42,631
sorry,

2823
01:22:42,631 --> 01:22:44,550
I blew it on like a rape apologist.

2824
01:22:45,560 --> 01:22:46,830
You asshole.

2825
01:22:47,790 --> 01:22:48,990
Everyone's got their opinion.

2826
01:22:49,590 --> 01:22:51,070
Rape apologists

2827
01:22:53,610 --> 01:22:54,300
whole.

2828
01:22:54,300 --> 01:22:55,290
I'm part South American.

2829
01:22:55,440 --> 01:22:55,921
Oh,

2830
01:22:55,921 --> 01:22:56,311
okay.

2831
01:22:56,311 --> 01:22:57,144
Well at least

2832
01:22:59,550 --> 01:23:00,930
I'm thinking native actually.

2833
01:23:00,990 --> 01:23:01,350
Whoa.

2834
01:23:01,350 --> 01:23:02,130
Yeah.

2835
01:23:02,130 --> 01:23:03,090
Went there a little bit.

2836
01:23:03,890 --> 01:23:04,723
Freedom.

2837
01:23:04,980 --> 01:23:05,813
I'm driving.

2838
01:23:06,120 --> 01:23:07,470
Joey has always says that about our,

2839
01:23:07,530 --> 01:23:08,500
our pal Eddie Bravo,

2840
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:09,281
Eddie Bravo.

2841
01:23:09,281 --> 01:23:11,760
We'll get a couple of drinks
and get a little fucking great.

2842
01:23:11,830 --> 01:23:13,360
I Love Eddie Brown was my brother,

2843
01:23:13,570 --> 01:23:14,230
but uh,

2844
01:23:14,230 --> 01:23:15,063
Eddie,

2845
01:23:15,070 --> 01:23:19,540
Eddie Bravo even adopt the phrase Joey
Dee has called that when the Indian comes

2846
01:23:19,541 --> 01:23:19,990
out,

2847
01:23:19,990 --> 01:23:24,490
because South Americans are essentially
like Mexicans and especially our

2848
01:23:24,491 --> 01:23:25,310
Indians.

2849
01:23:25,310 --> 01:23:25,510
Right.

2850
01:23:25,510 --> 01:23:30,280
Mixed with Spaniards that came in like
they didn't originally apparently speak.

2851
01:23:30,310 --> 01:23:30,700
Yes.

2852
01:23:30,700 --> 01:23:31,030
Okay.

2853
01:23:31,030 --> 01:23:31,510
Yeah,

2854
01:23:31,510 --> 01:23:31,781
I mean the,

2855
01:23:31,781 --> 01:23:32,614
in Spaniards,

2856
01:23:32,900 --> 01:23:33,970
the ink is in the Spaniards.

2857
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:35,230
I mean that is like,

2858
01:23:35,230 --> 01:23:37,300
that's the root of a lot
of people from Mexico.

2859
01:23:37,540 --> 01:23:38,950
That's why there's like Spaniard,

2860
01:23:38,951 --> 01:23:40,260
like Oscar de la Jolla,

2861
01:23:40,380 --> 01:23:40,630
right.

2862
01:23:40,630 --> 01:23:43,810
Looking Mexicans and then
there's a double Hawkins.

2863
01:23:44,320 --> 01:23:45,153
That's more of a,

2864
01:23:45,370 --> 01:23:45,521
well,

2865
01:23:45,521 --> 01:23:46,261
there's some Mexicans.

2866
01:23:46,261 --> 01:23:48,230
It looked very native American right now.

2867
01:23:48,970 --> 01:23:49,300
Yeah,

2868
01:23:49,300 --> 01:23:50,330
but that's what Joey Diaz,

2869
01:23:50,350 --> 01:23:51,670
you say the Indians coming out,

2870
01:23:53,020 --> 01:23:54,100
fucking Indians coming out.

2871
01:23:54,150 --> 01:23:57,070
It's an Indians and they're
notorious issues with alcohol.

2872
01:23:57,440 --> 01:23:57,860
Dude,

2873
01:23:57,860 --> 01:23:58,210
my,

2874
01:23:58,210 --> 01:23:58,670
My,

2875
01:23:58,670 --> 01:23:59,940
you've raised your hand like,

2876
01:24:01,500 --> 01:24:01,710
well,

2877
01:24:01,710 --> 01:24:02,010
I'm,

2878
01:24:02,010 --> 01:24:02,500
I'm,

2879
01:24:02,500 --> 01:24:05,480
I'm my grandmother is half
Ojibwe Chippewa Indian.

2880
01:24:05,510 --> 01:24:06,830
Do you get money from the casino?

2881
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:07,550
I know,

2882
01:24:07,550 --> 01:24:08,211
not the casino,

2883
01:24:08,211 --> 01:24:11,870
but like if I wanted to go to school
and like live on a reservation,

2884
01:24:11,871 --> 01:24:13,130
I could receive the benefits.

2885
01:24:13,310 --> 01:24:14,780
I know I'm white as goat cheese,

2886
01:24:15,050 --> 01:24:15,920
but it's true.

2887
01:24:15,921 --> 01:24:18,440
Half a grandma's my grammy almost half.

2888
01:24:18,441 --> 01:24:19,760
So mom's a quarter.

2889
01:24:19,790 --> 01:24:19,971
Yeah.

2890
01:24:19,971 --> 01:24:23,320
So I'm pretty much junk after
like two drinks a fucking waste.

2891
01:24:23,321 --> 01:24:24,140
They're an eighth.

2892
01:24:24,140 --> 01:24:24,950
How many?

2893
01:24:24,950 --> 01:24:25,190
Yeah.

2894
01:24:25,190 --> 01:24:26,023
Wow.

2895
01:24:26,830 --> 01:24:28,160
Do you get money up to you?

2896
01:24:28,190 --> 01:24:29,500
Like a 16th right?

2897
01:24:29,560 --> 01:24:29,920
Um,

2898
01:24:29,920 --> 01:24:31,840
nobody getting money.

2899
01:24:31,860 --> 01:24:32,110
That's,

2900
01:24:32,110 --> 01:24:33,340
that's very complicated.

2901
01:24:33,341 --> 01:24:34,650
Like you have to be sort of in,

2902
01:24:34,690 --> 01:24:36,030
you have to live on a reservation.

2903
01:24:36,040 --> 01:24:37,000
You have to be willing.

2904
01:24:37,330 --> 01:24:38,163
No,

2905
01:24:39,120 --> 01:24:39,790
I want one.

2906
01:24:39,790 --> 01:24:40,780
I thought about it,

2907
01:24:41,020 --> 01:24:41,351
but I'm,

2908
01:24:41,351 --> 01:24:42,910
I'm in Los Angeles.

2909
01:24:43,280 --> 01:24:45,040
I don't want to move back to Minnesota.

2910
01:24:45,200 --> 01:24:45,990
You go to the tumor.

2911
01:24:45,990 --> 01:24:47,530
Not that I lived in Minnesota ever,

2912
01:24:47,531 --> 01:24:49,330
but that's where a lot of
my family is from here.

2913
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:49,751
Oh,

2914
01:24:49,751 --> 01:24:50,700
there's a couple of reservations.

2915
01:24:50,701 --> 01:24:51,534
There's the casinos.

2916
01:24:52,230 --> 01:24:54,070
She are owned by native Americans.

2917
01:24:55,140 --> 01:24:55,691
I know that,

2918
01:24:55,691 --> 01:24:56,410
but I didn't realize it.

2919
01:24:56,410 --> 01:24:57,120
Funny.

2920
01:24:57,120 --> 01:24:57,953
Here's,

2921
01:24:58,320 --> 01:24:59,280
you got a fun track.

2922
01:24:59,290 --> 01:25:00,130
I got a fun fact to you.

2923
01:25:00,140 --> 01:25:01,420
It's actually an unfun fact,

2924
01:25:01,430 --> 01:25:02,890
but in the state of California,

2925
01:25:03,160 --> 01:25:04,030
in the casinos,

2926
01:25:04,060 --> 01:25:04,840
why do I know this?

2927
01:25:04,840 --> 01:25:05,860
Because I like to gamble.

2928
01:25:06,160 --> 01:25:07,450
You can't throw dice.

2929
01:25:07,900 --> 01:25:10,060
It's illegal to throw dice
in the state of California.

2930
01:25:10,270 --> 01:25:10,811
So,

2931
01:25:10,811 --> 01:25:11,080
um,

2932
01:25:11,080 --> 01:25:11,891
if you want to play craps,

2933
01:25:11,891 --> 01:25:12,730
which I love to play,

2934
01:25:13,090 --> 01:25:13,590
they,

2935
01:25:13,590 --> 01:25:16,690
they have a deck of cards and
they flip two cards and then you,

2936
01:25:16,960 --> 01:25:17,321
you know,

2937
01:25:17,321 --> 01:25:18,390
attribute that too.

2938
01:25:19,100 --> 01:25:19,300
Yeah,

2939
01:25:19,300 --> 01:25:20,020
it's gross.

2940
01:25:20,020 --> 01:25:23,560
Let's you to use cards
and all the guys read man.

2941
01:25:23,561 --> 01:25:24,041
What's going on?

2942
01:25:24,041 --> 01:25:24,874
Are we going to live?

2943
01:25:25,100 --> 01:25:25,470
There's,

2944
01:25:25,470 --> 01:25:27,900
there's just fighter jets everywhere.

2945
01:25:27,930 --> 01:25:28,711
I'm telling you it's red.

2946
01:25:28,711 --> 01:25:29,100
Don,

2947
01:25:29,100 --> 01:25:31,860
did you want to shore all
the way back in fighter jets,

2948
01:25:31,880 --> 01:25:32,713
La there's,

2949
01:25:32,730 --> 01:25:33,271
there's a lot of,

2950
01:25:33,271 --> 01:25:33,901
there's people are like,

2951
01:25:33,901 --> 01:25:34,081
hey,

2952
01:25:34,081 --> 01:25:35,460
we're hearing all these fighter jets.

2953
01:25:35,461 --> 01:25:37,760
And then in San Francisco there
was a couple at a couple of,

2954
01:25:37,761 --> 01:25:38,594
now ours,

2955
01:25:39,330 --> 01:25:43,080
we have to accept the fact that we're
doing some creepy shit and other countries

2956
01:25:43,081 --> 01:25:44,220
and if it comes back to haunt us,

2957
01:25:44,430 --> 01:25:44,641
look,

2958
01:25:44,641 --> 01:25:47,430
these people are s slowly
showing up with a bowler.

2959
01:25:47,670 --> 01:25:48,900
The guy in Dallas died,

2960
01:25:49,170 --> 01:25:50,300
someone else is,

2961
01:25:50,430 --> 01:25:51,020
uh,

2962
01:25:51,020 --> 01:25:52,080
is a nursing Spain.

2963
01:25:52,560 --> 01:25:53,191
Someone flew.

2964
01:25:53,191 --> 01:25:53,491
I mean,

2965
01:25:53,491 --> 01:25:54,420
but in this country,

2966
01:25:54,421 --> 01:25:55,021
I'm not going to Spain,

2967
01:25:55,021 --> 01:25:55,854
sorry,

2968
01:25:56,460 --> 01:25:57,293
my fault.

2969
01:25:57,730 --> 01:25:58,050
They,

2970
01:25:58,050 --> 01:26:00,070
some woman just came here from a,

2971
01:26:00,090 --> 01:26:01,980
I think it was Liberia
or something like that,

2972
01:26:01,981 --> 01:26:03,980
and she has a in Los Angeles

2973
01:26:03,980 --> 01:26:08,090
lease advise motorists to avoid
portions of westside do to Obama visit.

2974
01:26:08,120 --> 01:26:10,760
So it might be that he's here still

2975
01:26:14,280 --> 01:26:16,780
the power that that dude
travels around with.

2976
01:26:16,781 --> 01:26:18,110
Well did that position,

2977
01:26:18,140 --> 01:26:19,640
you know she was Mitt Romney,

2978
01:26:19,641 --> 01:26:20,474
but at the same power.

2979
01:26:20,710 --> 01:26:20,930
No,

2980
01:26:20,930 --> 01:26:21,171
I'm not.

2981
01:26:21,171 --> 01:26:22,880
I'm not attributing it to him.

2982
01:26:22,881 --> 01:26:23,930
But we were talking to a friend,

2983
01:26:24,620 --> 01:26:26,250
we were talking.

2984
01:26:26,570 --> 01:26:28,480
What's he been doing about it?

2985
01:26:28,820 --> 01:26:30,260
Is Reading the Mormon Bible.

2986
01:26:30,320 --> 01:26:31,153
Let's talk about that.

2987
01:26:31,380 --> 01:26:32,213
Fine.

2988
01:26:34,410 --> 01:26:35,243
You know,

2989
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:38,030
think you do know.

2990
01:26:38,031 --> 01:26:38,211
It's,

2991
01:26:38,211 --> 01:26:41,260
you think you know what
he thinks you don't.

2992
01:26:41,360 --> 01:26:42,193
He didn't say.

2993
01:26:43,510 --> 01:26:44,331
If you had to guess,

2994
01:26:44,331 --> 01:26:45,270
what do you think he was thinking?

2995
01:26:46,280 --> 01:26:47,120
If you had to think,

2996
01:26:47,121 --> 01:26:48,680
what do you think you'd
be thinking right now?

2997
01:26:49,180 --> 01:26:49,350
Well,

2998
01:26:49,350 --> 01:26:50,150
I wouldn't play guitar.

2999
01:26:50,150 --> 01:26:50,983
No.

3000
01:26:52,610 --> 01:26:54,080
Obama wielding power.

3001
01:26:55,600 --> 01:26:56,480
What are you going to say?

3002
01:27:00,090 --> 01:27:00,510
Yeah,

3003
01:27:00,510 --> 01:27:01,520
I was talking to him.

3004
01:27:02,010 --> 01:27:02,770
It's okay.

3005
01:27:02,770 --> 01:27:03,603
It's okay.

3006
01:27:06,710 --> 01:27:08,270
You guys are just both polite.

3007
01:27:08,300 --> 01:27:09,320
That's why this is awkward.

3008
01:27:09,350 --> 01:27:09,750
We're nice.

3009
01:27:09,750 --> 01:27:11,000
One of you was a bulldog.

3010
01:27:11,220 --> 01:27:12,870
He's just control this conversation.

3011
01:27:13,220 --> 01:27:14,720
There's this kid in junior high,

3012
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:17,550
that fucking motherfucker,

3013
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:18,433
he had a crush on you.

3014
01:27:18,610 --> 01:27:19,490
Of course he did.

3015
01:27:21,740 --> 01:27:23,360
Was He now bad game?

3016
01:27:25,730 --> 01:27:27,350
Why didn't you develop sooner?

3017
01:27:27,410 --> 01:27:27,561
Well,

3018
01:27:27,561 --> 01:27:29,870
here's what you're to need to
learn about a lot of dudes.

3019
01:27:30,050 --> 01:27:32,120
Nobody teaches us how to talk to girls.

3020
01:27:32,270 --> 01:27:35,420
We just sort of have to figure it out
when we're 13 when we do a terrible job

3021
01:27:35,421 --> 01:27:40,421
for the first seven or 14 years of our
lives and then somewhere around 30 slowly

3022
01:27:42,340 --> 01:27:46,480
girls date older guys and then you get
into trouble while you better than when

3023
01:27:46,481 --> 01:27:47,070
you make some lists.

3024
01:27:47,070 --> 01:27:47,903
Your poach.

3025
01:27:48,050 --> 01:27:49,820
It's what I was talking about
with writing before earlier.

3026
01:27:49,820 --> 01:27:52,670
I think he's just letting it flow
slip too worried about it now.

3027
01:27:52,671 --> 01:27:54,710
You calculated looking for Mrs Ben.

3028
01:27:55,800 --> 01:27:56,870
I'm getting better.

3029
01:27:57,200 --> 01:27:57,980
Better.

3030
01:27:57,980 --> 01:28:00,380
How about where you were at
your worst when you're like,

3031
01:28:00,381 --> 01:28:05,381
I've hit rock bottom probably 24 25
we'll be doing kind of like an air of

3032
01:28:05,481 --> 01:28:06,620
desperation and everything.

3033
01:28:06,621 --> 01:28:07,454
I said,

3034
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:08,833
you know,

3035
01:28:11,440 --> 01:28:13,940
I've never had like the single years.

3036
01:28:14,030 --> 01:28:14,863
You know what I mean?

3037
01:28:14,870 --> 01:28:15,703
I've always been like,

3038
01:28:15,860 --> 01:28:17,660
go on girlfriend and his girlfriend.

3039
01:28:17,680 --> 01:28:18,010
Yeah,

3040
01:28:18,010 --> 01:28:22,670
that's what a single years are
great if you're successful,

3041
01:28:23,360 --> 01:28:24,590
but if you're unsuccessful,

3042
01:28:24,591 --> 01:28:26,060
it's horrible and lonely.

3043
01:28:26,570 --> 01:28:27,620
It can be very sad.

3044
01:28:27,950 --> 01:28:30,530
And there's also that sort
of like stigma of like,

3045
01:28:30,531 --> 01:28:31,221
I'm the man,

3046
01:28:31,221 --> 01:28:32,990
I need to take the lady
out and impress her,

3047
01:28:32,991 --> 01:28:35,720
but it's like sleeping on my
friend's couch for two months.

3048
01:28:35,990 --> 01:28:36,860
Do you want to go out?

3049
01:28:37,160 --> 01:28:37,641
Yeah.

3050
01:28:37,641 --> 01:28:38,061
There's that.

3051
01:28:38,061 --> 01:28:39,500
Also that thing that you realize,

3052
01:28:39,501 --> 01:28:42,680
like when you're really
struggling as an artist,

3053
01:28:42,681 --> 01:28:43,940
I guess as a musician,

3054
01:28:44,330 --> 01:28:46,310
definitely as a comedian
it's very similar,

3055
01:28:46,640 --> 01:28:47,240
but you don't,

3056
01:28:47,240 --> 01:28:47,601
you know,

3057
01:28:47,601 --> 01:28:48,434
you know

3058
01:28:49,730 --> 01:28:54,060
nothing pure wits go along way.

3059
01:28:54,390 --> 01:28:55,110
I think that if,

3060
01:28:55,110 --> 01:29:00,050
if wherever you're at and who you are
and where you're going is up to where

3061
01:29:00,051 --> 01:29:01,800
you're going is up to whatever,

3062
01:29:01,801 --> 01:29:02,070
I don't

3063
01:29:02,070 --> 01:29:02,903
fucking know.

3064
01:29:02,930 --> 01:29:03,763
But

3065
01:29:04,770 --> 01:29:05,603
the ether

3066
01:29:07,350 --> 01:29:08,430
playing guitar.

3067
01:29:09,750 --> 01:29:09,991
Yeah,

3068
01:29:09,991 --> 01:29:10,430
sure.

3069
01:29:10,430 --> 01:29:10,980
Buddha,

3070
01:29:10,980 --> 01:29:11,370
but,

3071
01:29:11,370 --> 01:29:11,970
but you know,

3072
01:29:11,970 --> 01:29:13,260
when you meet somebody that's like,

3073
01:29:13,560 --> 01:29:14,520
I think you're fucking awesome.

3074
01:29:14,521 --> 01:29:14,760
I don't,

3075
01:29:14,760 --> 01:29:19,140
I don't care that you're not where you
want to be financially or professionally.

3076
01:29:19,170 --> 01:29:20,003
I think you're awesome.

3077
01:29:20,220 --> 01:29:23,250
That's the best time check
on that motherfucker.

3078
01:29:26,380 --> 01:29:27,213
Definitely.

3079
01:29:27,330 --> 01:29:28,410
When was the last time?

3080
01:29:28,411 --> 01:29:29,244
Oh Man.

3081
01:29:29,330 --> 01:29:30,340
Where's your clothes?

3082
01:29:34,090 --> 01:29:35,160
Brush your fucking Weirdo.

3083
01:29:36,060 --> 01:29:36,650
Oh Man,

3084
01:29:36,650 --> 01:29:37,660
you're wearing my deodorant.

3085
01:29:38,440 --> 01:29:39,050
Go ahead.

3086
01:29:39,050 --> 01:29:40,080
Sorry man.

3087
01:29:40,081 --> 01:29:40,440
I did it.

3088
01:29:40,440 --> 01:29:41,970
Two guys that wear women's deodorant.

3089
01:29:42,660 --> 01:29:43,280
I like it.

3090
01:29:43,280 --> 01:29:44,160
So I was like peaches,

3091
01:29:44,750 --> 01:29:45,900
but I wear men's deodorant,

3092
01:29:45,920 --> 01:29:47,570
so take that for what?

3093
01:29:47,640 --> 01:29:48,480
Of Men's deodorant

3094
01:29:50,070 --> 01:29:50,903
in my purse.

3095
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:51,833
Brian Calendar.

3096
01:29:52,970 --> 01:29:53,820
So clean.

3097
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:57,040
Brian Callen just told me about
some natural dealer to try.

3098
01:29:57,420 --> 01:30:00,290
He said it's like an aloe vera
based deodorant that really works.

3099
01:30:00,310 --> 01:30:01,143
It's a natural healer.

3100
01:30:01,170 --> 01:30:04,110
He and he's the first one to tell
you that natural deodorants are most,

3101
01:30:04,530 --> 01:30:05,071
most of the time,

3102
01:30:05,071 --> 01:30:07,020
their bullshit last long.

3103
01:30:07,020 --> 01:30:09,000
Usually it's usually they
last a couple of hours.

3104
01:30:09,270 --> 01:30:10,600
It depends how smelly you are.

3105
01:30:11,160 --> 01:30:13,870
I'm just thinking one of the
four yard he went to them

3106
01:30:15,750 --> 01:30:18,930
strong enough for a man made for men.

3107
01:30:20,010 --> 01:30:20,350
Yeah.

3108
01:30:20,350 --> 01:30:21,183
I'm not

3109
01:30:23,580 --> 01:30:24,420
strong enough for man,

3110
01:30:24,421 --> 01:30:25,254
but made for a woman.

3111
01:30:25,260 --> 01:30:26,093
No,

3112
01:30:26,280 --> 01:30:26,431
no.

3113
01:30:26,431 --> 01:30:28,140
If I put it on this going to be problems.

3114
01:30:28,470 --> 01:30:29,303
Okay.

3115
01:30:30,120 --> 01:30:30,980
What type of problems?

3116
01:30:31,260 --> 01:30:32,093
Like my

3117
01:30:33,900 --> 01:30:35,220
smell will go to war.

3118
01:30:35,390 --> 01:30:37,120
That wimpy ass fucking flower.

3119
01:30:37,220 --> 01:30:38,610
Refute Bullshit.

3120
01:30:39,420 --> 01:30:39,690
No,

3121
01:30:39,690 --> 01:30:40,381
I understand.

3122
01:30:40,381 --> 01:30:41,850
But not strong enough for a man.

3123
01:30:41,851 --> 01:30:43,020
But made for a woman.

3124
01:30:43,080 --> 01:30:43,561
What was that like?

3125
01:30:43,561 --> 01:30:44,230
Sure.

3126
01:30:44,230 --> 01:30:45,630
What secret secret.

3127
01:30:45,631 --> 01:30:46,290
Secret.

3128
01:30:46,290 --> 01:30:46,831
Secret.

3129
01:30:46,831 --> 01:30:47,664
It's showing the,

3130
01:30:47,780 --> 01:30:49,080
it's made for a woman.

3131
01:30:50,250 --> 01:30:55,080
Isn't that funny how like one advertising
slogan like that can just fucking give

3132
01:30:55,081 --> 01:30:55,470
a hoot.

3133
01:30:55,470 --> 01:30:56,840
Don't pollute that stuck.

3134
01:30:57,210 --> 01:30:58,500
Don't taste the rainbow.

3135
01:30:58,650 --> 01:30:59,483
Ooh.

3136
01:31:00,510 --> 01:31:01,500
It's the real thing.

3137
01:31:01,590 --> 01:31:02,423
Coke,

3138
01:31:02,700 --> 01:31:03,533
the real thing.

3139
01:31:04,920 --> 01:31:06,240
It'll clean your car battery,

3140
01:31:06,570 --> 01:31:07,403
that's for sure.

3141
01:31:08,980 --> 01:31:10,470
A Coca Cola yesterday,

3142
01:31:10,500 --> 01:31:15,220
which I hadn't had ears drain the
whole thing when you weren't there

3143
01:31:17,870 --> 01:31:19,060
kind of bed.

3144
01:31:19,560 --> 01:31:20,100
Honestly,

3145
01:31:20,100 --> 01:31:20,933
I wasn't into it.

3146
01:31:21,240 --> 01:31:24,620
When we find out that some people drink
like eight or nine of those in a day,

3147
01:31:25,580 --> 01:31:27,460
you know more on the road you see,

3148
01:31:27,461 --> 01:31:30,840
you see truckers come in with like a
fucking big gulfs like the whole thing and

3149
01:31:30,841 --> 01:31:32,700
they'll fill the whole thing up
with mountain doing the whole time.

3150
01:31:32,701 --> 01:31:32,911
I'm like,

3151
01:31:32,911 --> 01:31:33,600
oh my God.

3152
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:34,380
Cancer.

3153
01:31:34,380 --> 01:31:35,610
Like I just think about that.

3154
01:31:35,850 --> 01:31:38,670
I was driving across the country recently.

3155
01:31:39,270 --> 01:31:40,103
Some truckers,

3156
01:31:40,140 --> 01:31:41,160
I love everybody,

3157
01:31:41,550 --> 01:31:42,630
don't drink that shit.

3158
01:31:43,080 --> 01:31:45,960
Just drink water and
then drink beer later.

3159
01:31:45,961 --> 01:31:48,870
The good step and saying that for
years I was looking at the back of some

3160
01:31:48,871 --> 01:31:49,780
truckers truck,

3161
01:31:49,800 --> 01:31:53,740
new advertising for more drivers and they
said 50 cents a mile or something and

3162
01:31:53,840 --> 01:31:57,510
the average is 6,000 ma you can't
exceed a certain mileage limit.

3163
01:31:57,511 --> 01:31:59,320
And I realize what these dudes are doing.

3164
01:31:59,321 --> 01:32:01,840
Cause sometimes I actually think about
this cause we drive so much and I'm like,

3165
01:32:01,841 --> 01:32:02,830
if this doesn't work out,

3166
01:32:03,040 --> 01:32:04,990
what am I qualified to do music?

3167
01:32:05,140 --> 01:32:05,980
It's what I meant.

3168
01:32:06,310 --> 01:32:07,210
I can be a truck driver,

3169
01:32:07,240 --> 01:32:07,571
honestly,

3170
01:32:07,571 --> 01:32:11,740
because I've driven so fucking much that
sometimes I think about that coming to

3171
01:32:11,741 --> 01:32:12,574
my head.

3172
01:32:12,580 --> 01:32:13,180
Um,

3173
01:32:13,180 --> 01:32:14,610
and why do you think about that?

3174
01:32:15,170 --> 01:32:15,910
Think about that.

3175
01:32:15,910 --> 01:32:16,550
You know,

3176
01:32:16,550 --> 01:32:16,990
I dunno.

3177
01:32:16,990 --> 01:32:18,370
Just like a residual.

3178
01:32:18,550 --> 01:32:19,121
Hey Man,

3179
01:32:19,121 --> 01:32:20,050
you've got to like a,

3180
01:32:20,051 --> 01:32:21,460
a fear,

3181
01:32:21,461 --> 01:32:21,970
you know,

3182
01:32:21,970 --> 01:32:23,440
residual fear from saying,

3183
01:32:23,441 --> 01:32:24,220
okay,

3184
01:32:24,220 --> 01:32:25,640
you're confronting something like

3185
01:32:27,420 --> 01:32:29,350
nat unnatural thing.

3186
01:32:29,351 --> 01:32:29,861
You know what I mean?

3187
01:32:29,861 --> 01:32:33,150
I'm going into a risky thing and we,

3188
01:32:33,960 --> 01:32:35,320
we could sell pizza together.

3189
01:32:37,660 --> 01:32:41,470
I honestly think about that
sometimes to work at Santos Pizza.

3190
01:32:41,500 --> 01:32:44,310
That's part of the reason I've invested
in you so much because I know this does

3191
01:32:44,320 --> 01:32:45,520
the backup contingency,

3192
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:46,241
honey.

3193
01:32:46,241 --> 01:32:46,890
Honey band.

3194
01:32:46,890 --> 01:32:48,730
Follow them on Twitter and Instagram.

3195
01:32:48,880 --> 01:32:49,181
Honey,

3196
01:32:49,181 --> 01:32:50,040
honey band it.

3197
01:32:50,041 --> 01:32:50,890
Don't stop talking.

3198
01:32:53,020 --> 01:32:54,220
They want you to love them,

3199
01:32:54,900 --> 01:32:56,440
but speaking of advertisements,

3200
01:32:58,400 --> 01:32:59,380
what you want to talk about it?

3201
01:32:59,381 --> 01:32:59,920
It's fine.

3202
01:32:59,920 --> 01:33:00,571
We should talk about it.

3203
01:33:00,571 --> 01:33:01,130
A tour.

3204
01:33:01,130 --> 01:33:02,590
He guys battling it out right now.

3205
01:33:02,610 --> 01:33:03,160
This is it,

3206
01:33:03,160 --> 01:33:03,993
dude,

3207
01:33:05,460 --> 01:33:06,160
right now.

3208
01:33:06,160 --> 01:33:06,520
Joe,

3209
01:33:06,520 --> 01:33:07,390
you don't even know.

3210
01:33:08,410 --> 01:33:09,243
Fucking real man.

3211
01:33:11,020 --> 01:33:11,980
I don't want to hear that.

3212
01:33:13,730 --> 01:33:16,570
I want to think that you guys are the
way you are when you hear all the time.

3213
01:33:17,320 --> 01:33:18,900
I want to think that you are the way,

3214
01:33:19,310 --> 01:33:22,090
the way everybody was on cheers
and the shadow around the bar.

3215
01:33:22,540 --> 01:33:25,030
I don't want to think that
anybody goes description.

3216
01:33:25,420 --> 01:33:27,750
Antidepressants was the taxi taxi.

3217
01:33:27,751 --> 01:33:28,584
What are you talking about?

3218
01:33:29,800 --> 01:33:34,670
Go Watch the [inaudible].

3219
01:33:35,420 --> 01:33:36,253
Wait,

3220
01:33:36,890 --> 01:33:37,030
no,

3221
01:33:37,030 --> 01:33:37,900
his wife was in shit.

3222
01:33:38,070 --> 01:33:38,903
Goddammit,

3223
01:33:39,160 --> 01:33:42,280
you were born in 1995 that's when
I graduated from high school.

3224
01:33:42,650 --> 01:33:44,980
That was 17 you were
a baby and I was like,

3225
01:33:45,280 --> 01:33:46,200
hi baby.

3226
01:33:48,070 --> 01:33:48,521
Oh my God,

3227
01:33:48,521 --> 01:33:48,620
you.

3228
01:33:48,620 --> 01:33:49,570
We're pretty 30 now.

3229
01:33:50,200 --> 01:33:51,040
You both beautiful.

3230
01:33:51,190 --> 01:33:51,371
Hey,

3231
01:33:51,371 --> 01:33:52,204
thanks babe.

3232
01:33:52,870 --> 01:33:53,500
Looking good.

3233
01:33:53,500 --> 01:33:54,460
I think you do too.

3234
01:33:54,461 --> 01:33:55,294
Honestly,

3235
01:33:56,680 --> 01:33:57,580
very symmetrical.

3236
01:33:57,581 --> 01:33:58,001
Thank you.

3237
01:33:58,001 --> 01:33:58,950
I feel symmetrical

3238
01:34:01,210 --> 01:34:02,770
but geometry is off though.

3239
01:34:03,310 --> 01:34:04,143
What do you mean?

3240
01:34:04,980 --> 01:34:05,813
Can I ask?

3241
01:34:05,940 --> 01:34:07,140
Can I completely,

3242
01:34:07,510 --> 01:34:11,290
I completely fucking take
a left hand turn here.

3243
01:34:11,550 --> 01:34:12,020
This is,

3244
01:34:12,020 --> 01:34:12,551
this is something,

3245
01:34:12,551 --> 01:34:14,680
cause I think a questions
in my life and honestly,

3246
01:34:14,681 --> 01:34:17,620
you're the only dude I can
think of that might answer them.

3247
01:34:17,750 --> 01:34:20,920
Here it comes from gay shit again.

3248
01:34:20,921 --> 01:34:21,460
You know what?

3249
01:34:21,460 --> 01:34:22,480
Now you've made me timid.

3250
01:34:22,530 --> 01:34:24,180
I'm going to take a second.

3251
01:34:27,100 --> 01:34:28,610
Marijuana cause next 20 minutes.

3252
01:34:28,620 --> 01:34:29,453
You know a lot about this.

3253
01:34:29,530 --> 01:34:30,011
We have enough.

3254
01:34:30,011 --> 01:34:30,341
We'd,

3255
01:34:30,341 --> 01:34:31,720
if it ends in the next 20 minutes,

3256
01:34:31,721 --> 01:34:32,890
if it goes more than an hour,

3257
01:34:32,891 --> 01:34:36,360
we're going to have to go
outside Brogan's character.

3258
01:34:36,910 --> 01:34:37,870
We're going to have to call speed.

3259
01:34:38,960 --> 01:34:39,550
Okay.

3260
01:34:39,550 --> 01:34:40,390
Oh that was a great movie.

3261
01:34:41,050 --> 01:34:41,510
Goddammit.

3262
01:34:41,510 --> 01:34:42,343
Will respond.

3263
01:34:43,450 --> 01:34:44,111
Rated movie.

3264
01:34:44,111 --> 01:34:44,944
Right?

3265
01:34:46,090 --> 01:34:47,560
Fucking what's his name?

3266
01:34:47,740 --> 01:34:48,700
Eastbound and down.

3267
01:34:48,830 --> 01:34:49,663
Dan and Brian,

3268
01:34:50,110 --> 01:34:50,943
he's the man.

3269
01:34:51,820 --> 01:34:52,653
He's the man.

3270
01:34:52,850 --> 01:34:53,950
Marries one of my favorite people.

3271
01:34:53,951 --> 01:34:55,420
Ever love that guy.

3272
01:34:56,380 --> 01:34:57,180
I would love to.

3273
01:34:57,180 --> 01:34:58,013
He probably wouldn't do it,

3274
01:34:58,040 --> 01:34:58,873
but if he did,

3275
01:34:59,660 --> 01:35:00,493
I'd hug him.

3276
01:35:01,010 --> 01:35:02,180
Where you kiss him on the mouth.

3277
01:35:02,210 --> 01:35:03,043
Fuck yeah.

3278
01:35:04,520 --> 01:35:06,110
God cast.

3279
01:35:10,980 --> 01:35:13,220
I believe you in the mouth to
get you back on the podcast.

3280
01:35:13,221 --> 01:35:15,380
I'll kiss you on the fucking question.

3281
01:35:16,670 --> 01:35:18,450
I might have a weak question.

3282
01:35:18,460 --> 01:35:19,750
I saw your lower lip just

3283
01:35:21,350 --> 01:35:22,250
become derailed.

3284
01:35:22,310 --> 01:35:23,011
What's your question?

3285
01:35:23,011 --> 01:35:23,844
Or do you empty?

3286
01:35:24,410 --> 01:35:28,130
You guys argue before you got
here was a really good day.

3287
01:35:28,650 --> 01:35:32,970
Like Ice Cube Alexa.

3288
01:35:36,820 --> 01:35:37,720
Oh my God.

3289
01:35:38,690 --> 01:35:39,351
I don't even care about,

3290
01:35:39,351 --> 01:35:40,184
what was your question?

3291
01:35:41,100 --> 01:35:43,230
So I used to smoke a ton of wheat.

3292
01:35:43,260 --> 01:35:43,580
Oh,

3293
01:35:43,580 --> 01:35:44,241
just too much.

3294
01:35:44,241 --> 01:35:45,074
What happened?

3295
01:35:48,740 --> 01:35:50,390
I don't feel like this is a safe space.

3296
01:35:51,190 --> 01:35:53,570
It doesn't feel like a safe space anymore.

3297
01:35:53,630 --> 01:35:54,920
I'm confused.

3298
01:35:55,640 --> 01:35:56,820
Am I on a play on it?

3299
01:35:57,170 --> 01:35:57,711
Hey guys,

3300
01:35:57,711 --> 01:35:58,544
sorry.

3301
01:35:59,150 --> 01:35:59,983
Stick up for me.

3302
01:36:01,210 --> 01:36:03,320
You Airwolf right out that door.

3303
01:36:03,350 --> 01:36:04,183
You know it doesn't help.

3304
01:36:04,580 --> 01:36:05,001
Suzanne,

3305
01:36:05,001 --> 01:36:05,880
I love you so much.

3306
01:36:06,620 --> 01:36:07,390
I love you so much.

3307
01:36:07,390 --> 01:36:07,490
Yeah.

3308
01:36:07,490 --> 01:36:07,710
You know,

3309
01:36:07,710 --> 01:36:10,670
it doesn't help a lot when I've got him.

3310
01:36:10,671 --> 01:36:13,050
I'm being misogynistic
when I'm struggling in a,

3311
01:36:13,340 --> 01:36:14,570
in you come up and save me.

3312
01:36:14,571 --> 01:36:14,751
You know,

3313
01:36:14,751 --> 01:36:15,171
it's kind of like,

3314
01:36:15,171 --> 01:36:16,004
oh

3315
01:36:16,720 --> 01:36:17,500
no,

3316
01:36:17,500 --> 01:36:17,770
no,

3317
01:36:17,770 --> 01:36:18,020
no,

3318
01:36:18,020 --> 01:36:18,231
no,

3319
01:36:18,231 --> 01:36:18,491
no,

3320
01:36:18,491 --> 01:36:18,740
no,

3321
01:36:18,740 --> 01:36:19,011
no,

3322
01:36:19,011 --> 01:36:19,380
no,

3323
01:36:19,380 --> 01:36:19,520
no.

3324
01:36:19,520 --> 01:36:19,980
That's a little,

3325
01:36:19,980 --> 01:36:21,110
besides gender.

3326
01:36:21,890 --> 01:36:23,140
Sam was a man.

3327
01:36:23,141 --> 01:36:27,970
If you were were Sam instead of Suzanne
and a man had a save you every time you

3328
01:36:27,971 --> 01:36:30,220
fucking hit the wall and the
drain would have topped out,

3329
01:36:30,550 --> 01:36:30,941
he'd be like,

3330
01:36:30,941 --> 01:36:31,774
what the fuck?

3331
01:36:32,500 --> 01:36:33,333
First of all,

3332
01:36:33,480 --> 01:36:34,590
I think you need to let go of that.

3333
01:36:34,591 --> 01:36:38,930
We're partners so we take care of
each other and I know you can answer.

3334
01:36:40,680 --> 01:36:41,880
If I were a dude I was like,

3335
01:36:41,881 --> 01:36:42,570
Yo Bro,

3336
01:36:42,570 --> 01:36:44,280
my fucking dude's got something to say.

3337
01:36:46,530 --> 01:36:48,210
Brody Stevens is 84% gay.

3338
01:36:48,211 --> 01:36:48,720
Who's Brody?

3339
01:36:48,720 --> 01:36:50,460
And you don't know who that is either.

3340
01:36:50,470 --> 01:36:50,930
Just fuck ups.

3341
01:36:50,930 --> 01:36:51,763
Is that,

3342
01:36:52,740 --> 01:36:53,573
is that your dad?

3343
01:36:55,440 --> 01:36:57,510
You might as well be.

3344
01:36:57,511 --> 01:36:58,680
I'd love him like a father.

3345
01:36:59,910 --> 01:37:00,743
What's your question?

3346
01:37:01,260 --> 01:37:01,950
Okay.

3347
01:37:01,950 --> 01:37:02,460
Okay,

3348
01:37:02,460 --> 01:37:05,400
so it didn't smoke weed for a while and
I do every once in a while and I feel

3349
01:37:05,401 --> 01:37:07,950
like I get a cognitive boost when I do it.

3350
01:37:08,100 --> 01:37:09,120
Am I crazy?

3351
01:37:09,300 --> 01:37:09,720
No.

3352
01:37:09,720 --> 01:37:10,800
What is that?

3353
01:37:10,801 --> 01:37:14,280
What element of marijuana
slash THC is doing that?

3354
01:37:14,520 --> 01:37:15,030
Well,

3355
01:37:15,030 --> 01:37:15,870
it's like cocaine.

3356
01:37:15,871 --> 01:37:17,430
Ps shot that there's a rule.

3357
01:37:17,431 --> 01:37:19,800
Ben Can't smoke weed when
we're working cause he's like,

3358
01:37:20,910 --> 01:37:21,743
you want to do this?

3359
01:37:23,750 --> 01:37:24,511
Just just to,

3360
01:37:24,511 --> 01:37:26,100
just to frame the situation.

3361
01:37:26,550 --> 01:37:26,911
I,

3362
01:37:26,911 --> 01:37:28,680
if we have to do an all night drive,

3363
01:37:28,830 --> 01:37:31,050
I'll smoke because I can't fall asleep.

3364
01:37:31,400 --> 01:37:31,920
Fine.

3365
01:37:31,920 --> 01:37:32,281
Literally,

3366
01:37:32,281 --> 01:37:34,470
if I smoke be about five
hours before I go to sleep.

3367
01:37:35,040 --> 01:37:35,281
Well,

3368
01:37:35,281 --> 01:37:40,281
I would imagine it's because the way
your body reacts to cannabis is that your

3369
01:37:40,681 --> 01:37:41,514
body,

3370
01:37:41,630 --> 01:37:45,060
your creativity starts
to fire up and your,

3371
01:37:45,090 --> 01:37:45,840
your,

3372
01:37:45,840 --> 01:37:50,580
your mind starts to embrace different
possibilities then you would do if you

3373
01:37:50,581 --> 01:37:51,390
were sober.

3374
01:37:51,390 --> 01:37:56,070
It relaxes your inhibitions a little
and lets you pursue ideas that maybe

3375
01:37:56,100 --> 01:37:59,490
because of the fact that you're in this
precarious position in your career and

3376
01:37:59,491 --> 01:38:02,100
your life and that you're
constantly filled with anx.

3377
01:38:02,101 --> 01:38:05,850
Like most 30 year old
men may not shine easy.

3378
01:38:05,970 --> 01:38:06,271
Fuck.

3379
01:38:06,271 --> 01:38:11,271
47 47 I'm filled in some 47
you guys fucking dude it,

3380
01:38:11,980 --> 01:38:12,600
but red bands.

3381
01:38:12,600 --> 01:38:14,730
40 he gets some youthful motherfucker,

3382
01:38:14,750 --> 01:38:15,720
but we don't work.

3383
01:38:15,960 --> 01:38:16,621
Oh right.

3384
01:38:16,621 --> 01:38:18,620
We have real jobs is the toughest.

3385
01:38:19,180 --> 01:38:19,670
Nothing.

3386
01:38:19,670 --> 01:38:20,230
Nothing done.

3387
01:38:20,230 --> 01:38:20,911
I'm telling you,

3388
01:38:20,911 --> 01:38:21,361
I don't.

3389
01:38:21,361 --> 01:38:22,194
What's a real job?

3390
01:38:22,810 --> 01:38:23,130
Listen,

3391
01:38:23,130 --> 01:38:24,060
this is what a real job.

3392
01:38:24,540 --> 01:38:25,290
A real job.

3393
01:38:25,290 --> 01:38:25,461
No,

3394
01:38:25,461 --> 01:38:25,531
no,

3395
01:38:25,531 --> 01:38:25,681
no.

3396
01:38:25,681 --> 01:38:26,101
Trust me.

3397
01:38:26,101 --> 01:38:26,460
Trust me.

3398
01:38:26,460 --> 01:38:27,060
Trust me.

3399
01:38:27,060 --> 01:38:28,920
A real job was doing something
you don't want to do,

3400
01:38:28,921 --> 01:38:29,820
but you do it anyway.

3401
01:38:30,060 --> 01:38:30,970
We don't have real jobs.

3402
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:31,470
That's fine.

3403
01:38:31,470 --> 01:38:32,303
Do you have a real job,

3404
01:38:33,100 --> 01:38:33,631
a real job?

3405
01:38:33,631 --> 01:38:34,351
I'm not a real job.

3406
01:38:34,351 --> 01:38:35,310
There's no real jobs here.

3407
01:38:35,370 --> 01:38:35,971
There's no real job.

3408
01:38:35,971 --> 01:38:39,870
So that's a big part of aging
is to regret and despair.

3409
01:38:39,900 --> 01:38:41,130
You're not in the weeds anymore.

3410
01:38:41,131 --> 01:38:41,761
You're smoking.

3411
01:38:41,761 --> 01:38:44,300
Weed's perfectly said,

3412
01:38:44,400 --> 01:38:45,270
perfectly said.

3413
01:38:45,540 --> 01:38:46,950
That's the perfect way to say it.

3414
01:38:47,160 --> 01:38:49,140
And my point being,

3415
01:38:49,560 --> 01:38:50,400
um,

3416
01:38:50,810 --> 01:38:53,580
everybody who,

3417
01:38:53,880 --> 01:38:54,930
who smokes weed,

3418
01:38:54,931 --> 01:38:56,820
who doesn't smoke very often has a big,

3419
01:38:56,850 --> 01:38:58,050
it has a big impact on you.

3420
01:38:58,440 --> 01:39:02,190
W marijuana is one of those things where
it hits you when you don't do it a lot.

3421
01:39:02,460 --> 01:39:03,570
It hits you harder,

3422
01:39:03,720 --> 01:39:08,400
faster and more profoundly because
you have these things in your brain,

3423
01:39:08,430 --> 01:39:08,971
allegedly,

3424
01:39:08,971 --> 01:39:12,930
apparently from what I've read called
cannabinoid receptors that are literally

3425
01:39:12,931 --> 01:39:15,540
designed to accept the,

3426
01:39:15,541 --> 01:39:17,340
the influence of cannabis.

3427
01:39:17,870 --> 01:39:19,440
And then that's what they're there for.

3428
01:39:19,470 --> 01:39:24,470
And it comes from just gigantic history
of human beings consuming cannabis.

3429
01:39:24,511 --> 01:39:26,550
If these cannabinoid
receptors are also fired,

3430
01:39:26,551 --> 01:39:29,280
they believe when people do
like long distance running,

3431
01:39:29,281 --> 01:39:30,091
like jogging,

3432
01:39:30,091 --> 01:39:31,680
like people say they
get that runner's high,

3433
01:39:31,860 --> 01:39:35,410
it has a similar sort
of enough endorphins.

3434
01:39:35,480 --> 01:39:35,641
Well,

3435
01:39:35,641 --> 01:39:37,830
there's a bunch of different things
that happened inside the mind.

3436
01:39:38,040 --> 01:39:40,410
There's different neurotransmitters
that get activated.

3437
01:39:40,411 --> 01:39:42,210
There's dopamine and Serotonin,

3438
01:39:42,211 --> 01:39:43,740
a lot of those or exercise related,

3439
01:39:43,920 --> 01:39:47,910
but a lot of those are also related to
the consumption of psychedelic plants and

3440
01:39:47,911 --> 01:39:49,110
marijuana is a big one.

3441
01:39:49,140 --> 01:39:51,060
It's a giant part c.

3442
01:39:51,120 --> 01:39:55,620
We have this fucking idea that everything
that is the way it is from the time

3443
01:39:55,621 --> 01:39:59,040
that we've been alive and our parents had
been alive and the fucking just say no

3444
01:39:59,041 --> 01:40:01,260
to drugs from the Reagan
administration was there.

3445
01:40:01,500 --> 01:40:03,210
That this is the way the
world has always been.

3446
01:40:03,240 --> 01:40:04,073
It's not.

3447
01:40:04,230 --> 01:40:08,640
The world has been about consuming
cannabis for thousands and thousands and

3448
01:40:08,640 --> 01:40:09,330
thousands of years,

3449
01:40:09,330 --> 01:40:13,710
but we're growing up in a society where
fucking financial interest to figured

3450
01:40:13,711 --> 01:40:17,970
out a way to control the consumption
of gigantic amounts of people.

3451
01:40:18,270 --> 01:40:22,020
The consumption of one of the most
fantastic plants the world has ever known.

3452
01:40:22,200 --> 01:40:26,460
So when you do get ahold of one and it
fires you up and you start thinking about

3453
01:40:26,461 --> 01:40:28,290
shit and you're flying through space,

3454
01:40:28,291 --> 01:40:30,180
you have all these ideas what it is,

3455
01:40:30,181 --> 01:40:33,420
is it because it's awesome.

3456
01:40:33,900 --> 01:40:34,733
That's why.

3457
01:40:35,060 --> 01:40:38,610
That's the only reason why you smoke
it and you just can't shut the fuck up

3458
01:40:38,611 --> 01:40:39,870
cause you driving across country.

3459
01:40:40,020 --> 01:40:42,270
Those are thoughts that
you're caging up in your mind.

3460
01:40:42,271 --> 01:40:46,320
Like you're fucking like you got a
Pinata of ideas and you come along with a

3461
01:40:46,321 --> 01:40:48,170
hatchet and the hatchet and is,

3462
01:40:48,260 --> 01:40:52,980
it's in the shape of a joint and you
fire up that joint and just shop away at

3463
01:40:52,990 --> 01:40:57,990
that stupid fucking fake elephant and
candy comes pouring out and that candy is

3464
01:40:58,271 --> 01:41:02,290
these ideas that you've been sort of
containing in your mind and storing up and

3465
01:41:02,620 --> 01:41:07,620
processing with no outlet
and just just chemically,

3466
01:41:07,960 --> 01:41:09,490
chemically what's doing that.

3467
01:41:09,520 --> 01:41:10,930
Like what you have to re,

3468
01:41:11,040 --> 01:41:12,910
I'm obviously not a neuroscientist.

3469
01:41:12,930 --> 01:41:13,560
Oh okay.

3470
01:41:13,560 --> 01:41:14,770
Probably have brain damage.

3471
01:41:15,190 --> 01:41:16,023
You shouldn't do it.

3472
01:41:16,570 --> 01:41:18,160
I would suggest if I wasn't

3473
01:41:18,230 --> 01:41:18,501
me,

3474
01:41:18,501 --> 01:41:19,820
I would say don't listen to that dude.

3475
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:23,810
He's probably got a couple good
ideas that he memorized some website,

3476
01:41:24,020 --> 01:41:26,240
but everything else is
most likely nonsense.

3477
01:41:26,360 --> 01:41:29,930
So we should do is Google Google the
marijuana is affecting the mind and just

3478
01:41:30,830 --> 01:41:31,960
there's a lot of bullshit out

3479
01:41:31,990 --> 01:41:32,160
that's there.

3480
01:41:32,160 --> 01:41:32,993
There's a lot of,

3481
01:41:33,230 --> 01:41:34,031
I mean he has,

3482
01:41:34,031 --> 01:41:35,260
I think it affects everyone.

3483
01:41:35,261 --> 01:41:35,801
Very different.

3484
01:41:35,801 --> 01:41:36,290
Yes.

3485
01:41:36,290 --> 01:41:37,123
So you know,

3486
01:41:37,230 --> 01:41:39,580
which is the same street
that we could smoke together.

3487
01:41:39,700 --> 01:41:39,890
Yep.

3488
01:41:39,890 --> 01:41:40,070
Hi.

3489
01:41:40,070 --> 01:41:40,601
Is it though?

3490
01:41:40,601 --> 01:41:41,530
Because that's everything.

3491
01:41:41,780 --> 01:41:42,613
Peanuts.

3492
01:41:42,820 --> 01:41:43,331
Some people,

3493
01:41:43,331 --> 01:41:44,140
yeah.

3494
01:41:44,140 --> 01:41:44,973
Some people,

3495
01:41:45,460 --> 01:41:47,770
but I think that's a minority.

3496
01:41:47,800 --> 01:41:48,680
That's a tiny mine.

3497
01:41:49,110 --> 01:41:49,390
No,

3498
01:41:49,390 --> 01:41:49,571
no,

3499
01:41:49,571 --> 01:41:49,841
no.

3500
01:41:49,841 --> 01:41:49,960
It's,

3501
01:41:49,960 --> 01:41:50,560
come on.

3502
01:41:50,560 --> 01:41:50,741
No,

3503
01:41:50,741 --> 01:41:52,300
it's not a minority.

3504
01:41:52,510 --> 01:41:56,410
It's a minority in terms of it's less
than a hundred percent of the population

3505
01:41:56,670 --> 01:42:00,460
is less than 50% it's probably less than
10% of people who are allergic to like

3506
01:42:00,910 --> 01:42:01,750
whatever cats.

3507
01:42:01,830 --> 01:42:04,450
There's people that will die if
they in the room filled with cats.

3508
01:42:04,510 --> 01:42:04,870
Yeah.

3509
01:42:04,870 --> 01:42:05,703
You know,

3510
01:42:05,750 --> 01:42:06,970
firing diversity's real

3511
01:42:07,040 --> 01:42:07,161
well.

3512
01:42:07,161 --> 01:42:07,491
It's like,

3513
01:42:07,491 --> 01:42:10,700
it's like you could drink a
glass of wine and be fine.

3514
01:42:10,701 --> 01:42:14,630
You could drink a glass of
vodka and be a fucking lunatic.

3515
01:42:14,870 --> 01:42:15,210
Every,

3516
01:42:15,210 --> 01:42:17,930
it's know your body receives these things.

3517
01:42:17,931 --> 01:42:18,141
Is,

3518
01:42:18,141 --> 01:42:19,490
is complex.

3519
01:42:19,491 --> 01:42:20,810
And you know,

3520
01:42:21,020 --> 01:42:22,490
but that's just alcohol by volume,

3521
01:42:22,760 --> 01:42:23,031
you know,

3522
01:42:23,031 --> 01:42:23,810
what is your address?

3523
01:42:23,810 --> 01:42:27,050
Glass of wine or a certain amount
of glass of vodka has much more.

3524
01:42:27,240 --> 01:42:27,610
Yeah.

3525
01:42:27,610 --> 01:42:30,940
Well it's just basically talking about
what you were just saying is that every

3526
01:42:30,941 --> 01:42:31,661
person is different.

3527
01:42:31,661 --> 01:42:32,980
Everything affects them differently.

3528
01:42:33,130 --> 01:42:33,850
Definitely.

3529
01:42:33,850 --> 01:42:36,040
I'm really sensitive to weed.

3530
01:42:36,300 --> 01:42:37,570
Do you get high just being in this room?

3531
01:42:38,110 --> 01:42:40,080
I'm fucking off my rocker right now.

3532
01:42:40,190 --> 01:42:40,521
Also,

3533
01:42:40,521 --> 01:42:41,380
I'm kind of drunk.

3534
01:42:42,950 --> 01:42:46,250
It's hard to tell a little dry actually.

3535
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:48,390
Yeah.

3536
01:42:48,390 --> 01:42:49,223
Yeah.

3537
01:42:49,290 --> 01:42:50,123
But I have to pee.

3538
01:42:50,400 --> 01:42:50,940
Go Pee.

3539
01:42:50,940 --> 01:42:51,480
Okay.

3540
01:42:51,480 --> 01:42:53,550
Whenever I talk about being
stolen I go like this.

3541
01:42:54,560 --> 01:42:54,810
Do,

3542
01:42:54,810 --> 01:42:55,081
do,

3543
01:42:55,081 --> 01:42:55,321
do,

3544
01:42:55,321 --> 01:42:55,800
do,

3545
01:42:55,800 --> 01:42:56,633
do,

3546
01:42:57,370 --> 01:42:58,203
do.

3547
01:42:58,610 --> 01:42:58,770
Um,

3548
01:42:58,770 --> 01:42:59,350
bum bom,

3549
01:42:59,350 --> 01:43:00,260
bom bum,

3550
01:43:00,440 --> 01:43:00,940
bum,

3551
01:43:00,940 --> 01:43:01,773
bum,

3552
01:43:03,410 --> 01:43:04,720
bum bum.

3553
01:43:04,950 --> 01:43:05,783
Bom De

3554
01:43:08,270 --> 01:43:09,830
is that the band's back together.

3555
01:43:09,950 --> 01:43:10,191
Tom.

3556
01:43:10,191 --> 01:43:11,024
Dump on pal

3557
01:43:11,140 --> 01:43:13,110
in the sunshine.

3558
01:43:13,520 --> 01:43:14,353
Yeah.

3559
01:43:15,790 --> 01:43:16,623
No

3560
01:43:17,210 --> 01:43:17,901
beautiful man.

3561
01:43:17,901 --> 01:43:18,734
That is a beautiful,

3562
01:43:18,770 --> 01:43:19,603
yeah.

3563
01:43:21,640 --> 01:43:22,190
Um,

3564
01:43:22,190 --> 01:43:23,170
but I think it affects you,

3565
01:43:23,600 --> 01:43:25,910
but to answer your question
in all earnestness,

3566
01:43:26,360 --> 01:43:27,740
I think it's just cause
you don't do it a lot.

3567
01:43:29,020 --> 01:43:29,620
Okay.

3568
01:43:29,620 --> 01:43:30,700
I can accept that,

3569
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:31,390
but it's,

3570
01:43:31,390 --> 01:43:33,430
I just got curious about
what I take time off.

3571
01:43:33,431 --> 01:43:34,150
It does that.

3572
01:43:34,150 --> 01:43:34,983
Okay.

3573
01:43:36,630 --> 01:43:40,570
I'm just curious about what specific
processes happening to make me feel like,

3574
01:43:40,630 --> 01:43:41,171
Holy Shit.

3575
01:43:41,171 --> 01:43:44,740
I actually have access to all
these different thought patterns.

3576
01:43:44,741 --> 01:43:44,950
Now.

3577
01:43:44,950 --> 01:43:45,783
You know I don't,

3578
01:43:46,210 --> 01:43:47,650
let me give you some advice for a friend.

3579
01:43:47,690 --> 01:43:48,100
Yes,

3580
01:43:48,100 --> 01:43:48,311
yes,

3581
01:43:48,311 --> 01:43:49,970
please turn on comes.

3582
01:43:49,990 --> 01:43:52,070
Don't question how I got my Dick

3583
01:43:52,070 --> 01:43:53,000
so hot.

3584
01:43:53,720 --> 01:43:55,860
Just accept the fact I got the picture.

3585
01:43:55,870 --> 01:43:57,560
Your penis is in fact ready.

3586
01:43:57,750 --> 01:43:59,180
Don't think of pills.

3587
01:43:59,720 --> 01:44:00,250
Okay.

3588
01:44:00,250 --> 01:44:00,561
Look,

3589
01:44:00,561 --> 01:44:04,100
your body is learning so much is
flowing in a wash of chemicals.

3590
01:44:04,101 --> 01:44:04,401
This is it.

3591
01:44:04,401 --> 01:44:08,570
Your fault that the baby Jesus did not
bless you with the proper Dick Chemicals.

3592
01:44:09,050 --> 01:44:09,291
No,

3593
01:44:09,291 --> 01:44:10,124
it is not.

3594
01:44:10,370 --> 01:44:11,203
I just gotta.

3595
01:44:11,530 --> 01:44:12,760
I gotta live with what I got.

3596
01:44:12,761 --> 01:44:14,390
I don't have to live with what you got.

3597
01:44:14,391 --> 01:44:19,391
What he got smarter then the Creator
people have figured Viagara via,

3598
01:44:20,781 --> 01:44:21,110
you know,

3599
01:44:21,110 --> 01:44:21,831
the Creator said,

3600
01:44:21,831 --> 01:44:22,310
listen,

3601
01:44:22,310 --> 01:44:25,880
I want you to hit about
52 53 and you Dick's,

3602
01:44:25,881 --> 01:44:26,540
Jenna,

3603
01:44:26,540 --> 01:44:27,890
punch out desk.

3604
01:44:27,940 --> 01:44:28,100
No,

3605
01:44:28,100 --> 01:44:28,840
that's the best.

3606
01:44:28,840 --> 01:44:31,550
Says my dad is 63 when he had me.

3607
01:44:31,640 --> 01:44:32,181
Do you watch him?

3608
01:44:32,181 --> 01:44:33,014
Fuck

3609
01:44:33,490 --> 01:44:34,323
every time.

3610
01:44:35,020 --> 01:44:37,510
Takes every single time.

3611
01:44:37,520 --> 01:44:40,560
It probably takes bamboo
and ties it to his dick.

3612
01:44:41,120 --> 01:44:43,840
Stretches it out to keep it
hard then tapes it and place.

3613
01:44:44,860 --> 01:44:45,740
Thank you for saying that.

3614
01:44:46,860 --> 01:44:47,441
When you watch them,

3615
01:44:47,441 --> 01:44:48,550
do you just look back at it?

3616
01:44:48,980 --> 01:44:49,810
I hate it.

3617
01:44:49,810 --> 01:44:51,640
It's kind of like seeing my own future.

3618
01:44:51,870 --> 01:44:53,590
He's on tape and kite string.

3619
01:44:53,740 --> 01:44:54,970
He just keeps his cock.

3620
01:44:55,270 --> 01:44:55,391
No,

3621
01:44:55,391 --> 01:44:56,110
but I'm serious.

3622
01:44:56,110 --> 01:44:56,290
I'm

3623
01:44:56,290 --> 01:44:57,320
proud of my dad about,

3624
01:44:57,380 --> 01:44:57,730
honestly,

3625
01:44:57,730 --> 01:44:58,960
because I'm a very old dad.

3626
01:44:59,260 --> 01:45:00,610
My Dad's super fucking old.

3627
01:45:00,700 --> 01:45:01,533
How old is he now?

3628
01:45:02,260 --> 01:45:02,890
80.

3629
01:45:02,890 --> 01:45:03,670
Nope,

3630
01:45:03,670 --> 01:45:04,450
a thousand.

3631
01:45:04,450 --> 01:45:05,283
Almost

3632
01:45:07,150 --> 01:45:07,660
92.

3633
01:45:07,660 --> 01:45:08,493
93.

3634
01:45:08,620 --> 01:45:09,453
Oh my God.

3635
01:45:09,720 --> 01:45:11,020
And he's doing well.

3636
01:45:11,560 --> 01:45:12,700
He just broke his hip,

3637
01:45:13,510 --> 01:45:14,171
but he's okay.

3638
01:45:14,171 --> 01:45:14,981
He's doing great man.

3639
01:45:14,981 --> 01:45:16,040
Cause he's keeping his,

3640
01:45:16,060 --> 01:45:16,290
uh,

3641
01:45:16,290 --> 01:45:16,420
uh,

3642
01:45:16,420 --> 01:45:17,290
seriously.

3643
01:45:17,440 --> 01:45:19,150
He has all the way there.

3644
01:45:19,180 --> 01:45:20,013
He's with you.

3645
01:45:20,020 --> 01:45:20,591
You know what I mean?

3646
01:45:20,591 --> 01:45:21,730
And he's keeping the attitude.

3647
01:45:21,731 --> 01:45:23,560
He recognizes that if he gets depressed,

3648
01:45:23,561 --> 01:45:24,820
which is totally reasonable,

3649
01:45:25,060 --> 01:45:26,200
the fact that if he falls down,

3650
01:45:26,201 --> 01:45:27,034
which is what happened,

3651
01:45:27,520 --> 01:45:28,480
he tripped,

3652
01:45:28,481 --> 01:45:32,950
fell down to fucking broke the ball
off of his hip just by falling down.

3653
01:45:32,980 --> 01:45:34,330
His bones are that brittle.

3654
01:45:34,540 --> 01:45:35,140
Whoa.

3655
01:45:35,140 --> 01:45:39,130
But he knows that if he accepts that as,

3656
01:45:39,580 --> 01:45:39,970
I dunno,

3657
01:45:39,970 --> 01:45:40,840
a serious of things,

3658
01:45:40,841 --> 01:45:41,830
as some people might,

3659
01:45:42,010 --> 01:45:42,730
he's done.

3660
01:45:42,730 --> 01:45:43,630
He's literally done.

3661
01:45:44,080 --> 01:45:44,650
You know,

3662
01:45:44,650 --> 01:45:45,460
so he's with it,

3663
01:45:45,460 --> 01:45:46,030
man.

3664
01:45:46,030 --> 01:45:46,460
Wow.

3665
01:45:46,460 --> 01:45:47,291
He's positive.

3666
01:45:47,291 --> 01:45:48,124
He's feeling good.

3667
01:45:48,280 --> 01:45:50,020
That's our all of our future.

3668
01:45:50,080 --> 01:45:50,411
I mean,

3669
01:45:50,411 --> 01:45:54,310
we're all going to be 93 if we don't get
hit in the head by a fucking media or

3670
01:45:54,550 --> 01:45:57,070
if those jets don't mean
business because it could be it.

3671
01:45:57,071 --> 01:45:58,030
This could be the last day.

3672
01:45:58,900 --> 01:45:59,733
I would've enjoyed it.

3673
01:46:00,040 --> 01:46:05,040
That's one of the big problems with
being a person is that we all have the

3674
01:46:05,561 --> 01:46:07,180
ability to understand that are finite.

3675
01:46:07,810 --> 01:46:08,643
We all know it,

3676
01:46:08,800 --> 01:46:09,730
we rationalize it,

3677
01:46:09,731 --> 01:46:10,570
we have in our head,

3678
01:46:10,930 --> 01:46:14,920
but it never sort of reaches
our immediate consciousness.

3679
01:46:14,921 --> 01:46:16,850
It always sort of sits in the periphery,

3680
01:46:16,851 --> 01:46:19,330
is some future possibility.

3681
01:46:19,390 --> 01:46:19,511
Well,

3682
01:46:19,511 --> 01:46:20,970
you know what I think is the,

3683
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:26,000
the trickling down of that mindset is
us looking at our times as specific as

3684
01:46:27,581 --> 01:46:32,581
unique in terms of how desperate things
are or how close we are to the edge of

3685
01:46:32,591 --> 01:46:33,300
something.

3686
01:46:33,300 --> 01:46:33,800
You know,

3687
01:46:33,800 --> 01:46:34,633
the idea that like,

3688
01:46:34,750 --> 01:46:34,961
okay,

3689
01:46:34,961 --> 01:46:35,500
we're at the,

3690
01:46:35,500 --> 01:46:36,250
this is it.

3691
01:46:36,250 --> 01:46:36,581
You know,

3692
01:46:36,581 --> 01:46:38,440
they all look at all
this chaos in the world.

3693
01:46:38,560 --> 01:46:40,090
I think it's always been like that,

3694
01:46:40,240 --> 01:46:43,030
but our way of communicating
with mortality is saying no,

3695
01:46:43,031 --> 01:46:44,290
this time is unique.

3696
01:46:45,610 --> 01:46:45,941
Well,

3697
01:46:45,941 --> 01:46:47,320
this time is unique though.

3698
01:46:47,440 --> 01:46:50,070
Well of course it's unique in the sense
that events that are happening now,

3699
01:46:50,070 --> 01:46:51,230
I've never happened before that.

3700
01:46:51,270 --> 01:46:54,980
I think that's the number one draw of
and I mean it's nice to be nostalgist and

3701
01:46:55,260 --> 01:46:57,480
nostalgic and look at it in like in,

3702
01:46:57,481 --> 01:46:57,781
in,

3703
01:46:57,781 --> 01:47:02,781
in relationship to the Times that we're
unique in the 70s and the 60s and the

3704
01:47:03,241 --> 01:47:08,241
forties there every time has been the
pinnacle of human interactions at this

3705
01:47:09,571 --> 01:47:09,931
moment.

3706
01:47:09,931 --> 01:47:14,931
Right now at 2014 we are at the front
of the line of what it is to be a person

3707
01:47:15,270 --> 01:47:16,140
and we really are.

3708
01:47:16,180 --> 01:47:17,070
We were at the front,

3709
01:47:17,670 --> 01:47:21,280
we're at the front with phones or the
front with social media or the front with

3710
01:47:21,950 --> 01:47:22,650
with this,

3711
01:47:22,650 --> 01:47:23,060
this,

3712
01:47:23,060 --> 01:47:23,390
this,

3713
01:47:23,390 --> 01:47:25,620
this is fucking crazy podcast.

3714
01:47:25,680 --> 01:47:26,700
What we're doing right now.

3715
01:47:26,730 --> 01:47:27,121
These the,

3716
01:47:27,121 --> 01:47:30,540
the ability to talk to people
like do you really be Ben?

3717
01:47:30,541 --> 01:47:31,620
You really be Suzanne.

3718
01:47:31,621 --> 01:47:32,580
Be really be me,

3719
01:47:32,820 --> 01:47:33,653
Brian.

3720
01:47:34,080 --> 01:47:35,730
Brian is sort of him,

3721
01:47:35,850 --> 01:47:39,890
but even he is confused as
to what the fuck is going on.

3722
01:47:39,980 --> 01:47:41,370
Why you look fucking amazing.

3723
01:47:42,510 --> 01:47:43,490
We just learned that Brian's,

3724
01:47:44,400 --> 01:47:46,390
he's a sexy bitch skin,

3725
01:47:46,400 --> 01:47:48,830
like a newborn stash hair.

3726
01:47:49,130 --> 01:47:50,800
Even the weight of it's got to cook woman.

3727
01:47:50,810 --> 01:47:53,420
His life should go to dinner.

3728
01:47:53,450 --> 01:47:54,283
He doesn't have a job.

3729
01:47:55,040 --> 01:47:56,060
I have a show after this.

3730
01:47:56,061 --> 01:47:59,420
I'm doing the Ice House in Pasadena
and then I'm doing the Improv.

3731
01:47:59,840 --> 01:48:01,420
Does this mean we're not
hanging out after work?

3732
01:48:01,421 --> 01:48:05,150
And I know we just gotta get
my 22nd what you just said,

3733
01:48:05,151 --> 01:48:05,600
Ben,

3734
01:48:05,600 --> 01:48:06,021
calm down.

3735
01:48:06,021 --> 01:48:06,510
Sorry.

3736
01:48:06,510 --> 01:48:07,700
We're in the same town.

3737
01:48:07,740 --> 01:48:08,200
W what?

3738
01:48:08,200 --> 01:48:11,270
I just what you were just saying
about like where we're at right now.

3739
01:48:11,440 --> 01:48:11,750
Yeah.

3740
01:48:11,750 --> 01:48:13,760
Evolved and we're on this
podcast and we're talking,

3741
01:48:13,900 --> 01:48:14,820
we're speaking in,

3742
01:48:14,850 --> 01:48:17,390
in our truth in our own way.

3743
01:48:17,540 --> 01:48:18,260
Right.

3744
01:48:18,260 --> 01:48:21,020
That gives me hope because you know,

3745
01:48:21,021 --> 01:48:24,380
all of the sort of like sanitize
media and the things that you are,

3746
01:48:24,650 --> 01:48:25,250
are,

3747
01:48:25,250 --> 01:48:25,760
um,

3748
01:48:25,760 --> 01:48:30,050
given on a regular basis and the
information that's coming through.

3749
01:48:30,050 --> 01:48:31,040
I'm always doubtful.

3750
01:48:31,041 --> 01:48:35,630
I'm always weary and nervous and doubt,

3751
01:48:35,660 --> 01:48:36,050
you know,

3752
01:48:36,050 --> 01:48:37,100
I just don't believe it.

3753
01:48:37,190 --> 01:48:37,520
Right.

3754
01:48:37,520 --> 01:48:37,791
I mean,

3755
01:48:37,791 --> 01:48:40,190
I'm sure there's some actual,

3756
01:48:41,080 --> 01:48:41,360
you know,

3757
01:48:41,360 --> 01:48:42,320
reality to it,

3758
01:48:42,350 --> 01:48:47,350
but I think there's always an agenda
with major media market and whatever.

3759
01:48:48,010 --> 01:48:49,370
We were talking about
different things here.

3760
01:48:49,430 --> 01:48:49,550
No,

3761
01:48:49,550 --> 01:48:49,780
no,

3762
01:48:49,780 --> 01:48:50,613
no,

3763
01:48:50,760 --> 01:48:50,890
no,

3764
01:48:50,890 --> 01:48:51,080
no,

3765
01:48:51,080 --> 01:48:51,231
no,

3766
01:48:51,231 --> 01:48:51,411
no,

3767
01:48:51,411 --> 01:48:51,591
no,

3768
01:48:51,591 --> 01:48:51,831
no,

3769
01:48:51,831 --> 01:48:51,981
no.

3770
01:48:51,981 --> 01:48:52,790
But as far as,

3771
01:48:52,790 --> 01:48:53,240
um,

3772
01:48:53,240 --> 01:48:54,073
you know,

3773
01:48:54,110 --> 01:48:57,650
you were talking about like the
current state of our mortality and,

3774
01:48:57,651 --> 01:48:58,700
and you know,

3775
01:48:58,730 --> 01:48:59,180
our,

3776
01:48:59,180 --> 01:49:00,710
our visual of like,

3777
01:49:00,740 --> 01:49:00,921
Ooh,

3778
01:49:00,921 --> 01:49:01,880
it's really bad.

3779
01:49:01,910 --> 01:49:03,020
Or it's how it,

3780
01:49:03,110 --> 01:49:03,830
how it is.

3781
01:49:03,830 --> 01:49:04,910
I think that,

3782
01:49:04,940 --> 01:49:05,773
um,

3783
01:49:06,500 --> 01:49:07,333
the,

3784
01:49:07,460 --> 01:49:12,460
the way that we perceive the world
now you have options and options like

3785
01:49:13,940 --> 01:49:18,940
podcasts or are really learning about
someone else's viewpoint from there,

3786
01:49:20,930 --> 01:49:22,760
like right out of the horse's mouth.

3787
01:49:23,090 --> 01:49:23,500
Um,

3788
01:49:23,500 --> 01:49:25,580
on a podcast that's not funded by,

3789
01:49:25,790 --> 01:49:26,211
you know,

3790
01:49:26,211 --> 01:49:28,670
a major oil company or something,

3791
01:49:28,700 --> 01:49:29,533
right.

3792
01:49:29,680 --> 01:49:30,000
That,

3793
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:32,860
that's where I feel a
little more comfort and I'm,

3794
01:49:33,050 --> 01:49:34,070
am I confusing anybody?

3795
01:49:34,120 --> 01:49:34,953
No.

3796
01:49:34,960 --> 01:49:35,230
We're

3797
01:49:35,230 --> 01:49:36,190
having this conversation.

3798
01:49:36,191 --> 01:49:40,150
We're friends and it doesn't matter if
we're doing a different thing that we

3799
01:49:40,151 --> 01:49:42,760
would be doing if we were just hanging
out because we know that people are

3800
01:49:42,761 --> 01:49:43,480
listening.

3801
01:49:43,480 --> 01:49:46,000
So we're doing this different thing where
we're trying to be like really clear.

3802
01:49:46,001 --> 01:49:46,450
We're trying not,

3803
01:49:46,450 --> 01:49:49,110
you're doing a great with much
try not to talk over Suzanne,

3804
01:49:50,880 --> 01:49:51,621
just not get it.

3805
01:49:51,621 --> 01:49:52,454
That it's okay.

3806
01:49:54,300 --> 01:49:58,210
But what we're doing is there's
no other influences of the nos.

3807
01:49:58,211 --> 01:49:59,021
We know what we're doing.

3808
01:49:59,021 --> 01:50:00,220
We w we have this idea that,

3809
01:50:00,221 --> 01:50:00,401
okay,

3810
01:50:00,401 --> 01:50:00,580
we're,

3811
01:50:00,580 --> 01:50:03,280
we're putting out something that people
are going to receive and it's going to

3812
01:50:03,281 --> 01:50:04,114
be entertaining.

3813
01:50:04,910 --> 01:50:06,850
And we have our binder biases.

3814
01:50:06,851 --> 01:50:07,560
You know,

3815
01:50:07,560 --> 01:50:08,171
we are,

3816
01:50:08,171 --> 01:50:09,004
we're in a band.

3817
01:50:10,010 --> 01:50:11,230
We'd signed a record deal.

3818
01:50:11,231 --> 01:50:11,981
I was shit,

3819
01:50:11,981 --> 01:50:12,814
but we're not,

3820
01:50:12,970 --> 01:50:13,870
I understand what you're saying.

3821
01:50:13,871 --> 01:50:15,670
I think I'm just trying to
be super literal as Tom.

3822
01:50:15,680 --> 01:50:16,110
Sorry.

3823
01:50:16,110 --> 01:50:16,640
No,

3824
01:50:16,640 --> 01:50:17,230
even think it's not,

3825
01:50:17,230 --> 01:50:17,590
it's like,

3826
01:50:17,590 --> 01:50:18,100
it's,

3827
01:50:18,100 --> 01:50:19,330
we do this all the time.

3828
01:50:19,390 --> 01:50:22,390
So it's a weird form of expression,

3829
01:50:22,540 --> 01:50:22,870
right?

3830
01:50:22,870 --> 01:50:24,540
It's weird form of expression when you,

3831
01:50:24,590 --> 01:50:25,301
you're talking,

3832
01:50:25,301 --> 01:50:26,680
but you also know that
people are listening,

3833
01:50:27,120 --> 01:50:27,650
you know?

3834
01:50:27,650 --> 01:50:28,483
Um,

3835
01:50:28,750 --> 01:50:33,750
but the beautiful thing is there's no
interruptions and no one is telling you

3836
01:50:34,961 --> 01:50:35,620
yes or no.

3837
01:50:35,620 --> 01:50:38,020
Like there's no publicist is
standing over your shoulder saying,

3838
01:50:38,021 --> 01:50:39,160
this is bad for your career.

3839
01:50:39,310 --> 01:50:41,080
There's no go bean counter.

3840
01:50:41,081 --> 01:50:41,741
Who's saying,

3841
01:50:41,741 --> 01:50:42,131
listen,

3842
01:50:42,131 --> 01:50:42,431
Ben,

3843
01:50:42,431 --> 01:50:45,700
if you admit to gay thoughts and
wanting to kiss Brian Redman,

3844
01:50:45,701 --> 01:50:48,160
I'm the mouth because it
was beautiful mustache.

3845
01:50:49,330 --> 01:50:51,610
This is going to cost us 14 records,

3846
01:50:51,700 --> 01:50:54,970
an hour worth it worth every penny.

3847
01:50:57,580 --> 01:51:00,460
They might fucking break
and see that as a bad thing.

3848
01:51:01,570 --> 01:51:02,420
14 people are.

3849
01:51:02,520 --> 01:51:03,940
Cons is no free lunch.

3850
01:51:04,030 --> 01:51:05,530
Fucking shitty.

3851
01:51:06,550 --> 01:51:07,990
Let me express my love.

3852
01:51:07,991 --> 01:51:11,410
Never losing my country charm
or my fucking fanny pack.

3853
01:51:11,411 --> 01:51:13,630
Both of those things stay to the,

3854
01:51:14,080 --> 01:51:14,913
to the grave.

3855
01:51:14,920 --> 01:51:15,760
You have a fanny pack,

3856
01:51:15,761 --> 01:51:16,030
chuck.

3857
01:51:16,030 --> 01:51:16,900
Do I sell them?

3858
01:51:16,901 --> 01:51:17,734
Yes I do.

3859
01:51:18,070 --> 01:51:19,450
If I run out of them.

3860
01:51:19,451 --> 01:51:20,284
Yes.

3861
01:51:21,100 --> 01:51:22,620
primate.com selling coffee.

3862
01:51:22,690 --> 01:51:22,841
No,

3863
01:51:22,841 --> 01:51:23,501
this is my buddy.

3864
01:51:23,501 --> 01:51:26,080
This is just no interest in this business.

3865
01:51:26,980 --> 01:51:28,950
I mean other than the friendship interest,

3866
01:51:28,980 --> 01:51:29,621
no financial.

3867
01:51:29,621 --> 01:51:31,870
We talked last time
about bulletproof coffee.

3868
01:51:32,380 --> 01:51:34,840
Caveman coffee is my friend Tate.

3869
01:51:34,841 --> 01:51:35,350
And uh,

3870
01:51:35,350 --> 01:51:36,310
my friend Keith Jardine,

3871
01:51:36,340 --> 01:51:40,210
they have this company that they sell
single source coffee from this farm.

3872
01:51:40,420 --> 01:51:41,650
It's Colombia and Nicaragua.

3873
01:51:42,310 --> 01:51:42,701
I think it's,

3874
01:51:42,701 --> 01:51:43,570
I want to say Columbia,

3875
01:51:43,840 --> 01:51:44,500
but uh,

3876
01:51:44,500 --> 01:51:46,210
it's just the fucking salt of the earth.

3877
01:51:46,211 --> 01:51:46,840
Those dudes are,

3878
01:51:46,840 --> 01:51:48,790
I love Keith and I'm Tate is my brother.

3879
01:51:48,820 --> 01:51:50,350
So I wear the shirt.

3880
01:51:51,160 --> 01:51:54,090
It's a good look how to
respect wired loyalty.

3881
01:51:54,670 --> 01:51:54,881
Wait,

3882
01:51:54,881 --> 01:51:55,430
where's your show?

3883
01:51:55,430 --> 01:51:56,640
Because yeah.

3884
01:51:56,660 --> 01:51:57,190
You want to come?

3885
01:51:57,190 --> 01:51:57,461
Yeah.

3886
01:51:57,461 --> 01:51:59,600
I'm got the ice house at yeah.

3887
01:51:59,800 --> 01:52:00,940
At eight and then a,

3888
01:52:00,941 --> 01:52:01,780
I'm at the Improv.

3889

10 o'clock shows you work.

3890
01:52:05,350 --> 01:52:06,610
I'm working on some new shit,

3891
01:52:06,611 --> 01:52:08,440
so I got to bang out some new jokes.

3892
01:52:08,470 --> 01:52:09,240
I'm trying.

3893
01:52:09,240 --> 01:52:13,990
My comedy Central Special Airs November
21st so I'm in this weird scramble

3894
01:52:13,991 --> 01:52:17,740
trying to reconstruct the scaffolding
of my next hour right now.

3895
01:52:17,741 --> 01:52:19,210
It's like the really exciting,

3896
01:52:20,230 --> 01:52:20,890

3897
01:52:20,890 --> 01:52:21,221

Thank you for you.

3899
01:52:22,121 --> 01:52:23,110
Put our song in it.

3900
01:52:23,740 --> 01:52:23,981
Oh,

3901
01:52:23,981 --> 01:52:24,350

3904
01:52:26,231 --> 01:52:27,064
I picked it.

3905
01:52:27,780 --> 01:52:28,310
That song.

3906
01:52:28,310 --> 01:52:28,720
Yeah.

3907
01:52:28,720 --> 01:52:28,991

of Colorado and your songs playing in

3913
01:52:35,831 --> 01:52:36,664
the background.

3914
01:52:37,110 --> 01:52:38,140

3915
01:52:38,830 --> 01:52:40,790

3916

Oh.

3917
01:52:42,010 --> 01:52:43,690
Snappa like you hired it.

3918
01:52:43,800 --> 01:52:44,633
Where are you going to say?

3919
01:52:44,750 --> 01:52:45,583
Where are you guys up?

3920
01:52:46,270 --> 01:52:51,270
We're planning a story in a play in the
lounge and Denver and then beaver creek,

3921
01:52:51,351 --> 01:52:52,130

3922
01:52:52,130 --> 01:52:53,000
oh shit.

3923
01:52:53,060 --> 01:52:53,900
Beaver creek.

3924

We're going to Texas.

3925
01:52:55,131 --> 01:52:58,230
We're going to New Mexico or Louisiana.

3926
01:53:00,470 --> 01:53:00,711

Angeles on November 1st.

01:53:07,310 --> 01:53:08,300
What is in California?

3932
01:53:08,301 --> 01:53:08,750
What is it?

3933
01:53:08,750 --> 01:53:10,060

Do you want to come?

3935
01:53:11,180 --> 01:53:11,691
If I'm here,

3936
01:53:11,691 --> 01:53:11,991

Hold on.

3939
01:53:13,130 --> 01:53:13,963
You want a party?

3940
01:53:14,060 --> 01:53:14,960
It's a Saturday.

3941
01:53:14,990 --> 01:53:15,321
Listen,

3942
01:53:15,321 --> 01:53:17,960
we gotta be really careful
one day after Halloween,

3943
01:53:19,770 --> 01:53:20,830
so you have to take your,

3944
01:53:21,720 --> 01:53:22,910
your monkey suit off time.

3945
01:53:22,911 --> 01:53:24,450
Was it my monkeys?

3946
01:53:28,490 --> 01:53:32,330
Never for our time.

3947
01:53:33,380 --> 01:53:34,220
November 1st.

3948
01:53:34,250 --> 01:53:38,990
We want you exactly as you are you sorry.

3949

I'm going to be in.

3950
01:53:44,010 --> 01:53:44,450
We should,

3951
01:53:44,450 --> 01:53:45,283
um,

3952
01:53:46,310 --> 01:53:47,143
we should,

3953
01:53:47,330 --> 01:53:48,260
we should go hunting.

3954
01:53:49,260 --> 01:53:50,930
Do another show together
cause that'd be really fun.

3955
01:53:50,931 --> 01:53:51,501
Fuck yeah.

3956
01:53:51,501 --> 01:53:53,930
I mean we did the one December 21st,

3957
01:53:53,930 --> 01:53:54,730
2012 so that was like,

3958
01:53:54,730 --> 01:53:55,161
it was a while,

3959
01:53:55,161 --> 01:53:56,060
almost two years ago.

3960
01:53:56,061 --> 01:54:00,200
I was so excited because bill burr was
backstage and I just love him so much.

3961
01:54:00,201 --> 01:54:01,170
I love him so much too.

3962
01:54:01,400 --> 01:54:02,540
Came down to hanging out with us.

3963
01:54:02,710 --> 01:54:03,140
He's great.

3964
01:54:03,140 --> 01:54:03,973
He's awesome.

3965
01:54:04,040 --> 01:54:05,270
He's a sweet guy too.

3966
01:54:05,300 --> 01:54:05,871
He's a really,

3967
01:54:05,871 --> 01:54:08,060
really genuinely good guy.

3968
01:54:08,270 --> 01:54:08,600
Like,

3969
01:54:08,600 --> 01:54:12,140
you know like for for comics like to
see other comics that are like really

3970
01:54:12,141 --> 01:54:14,540
supportive and friendly is so important.

3971
01:54:14,810 --> 01:54:19,490
So he just showed up to hang out with
me and Joey and Dunkin and you guys.

3972
01:54:22,120 --> 01:54:23,210
I don't know him personally.

3973
01:54:23,560 --> 01:54:24,160
No person,

3974
01:54:24,160 --> 01:54:24,993
man.

3975
01:54:25,940 --> 01:54:26,810
I hear good things.

3976
01:54:26,900 --> 01:54:27,430
Yeah,

3977
01:54:27,430 --> 01:54:28,730
but I don't know him too much.

3978
01:54:28,960 --> 01:54:29,793
I don't hang out with them.

3979
01:54:30,080 --> 01:54:31,490
Maybe do a double podcast,

3980
01:54:31,700 --> 01:54:31,971
whatever,

3981
01:54:31,971 --> 01:54:32,804
whatever,

3982
01:54:33,020 --> 01:54:33,291
whatever,

3983
01:54:33,291 --> 01:54:35,360
whatever you want to do it.

3984
01:54:35,361 --> 01:54:37,040
Two years after the end of the world show,

3985
01:54:37,041 --> 01:54:38,870
that would be fucking pretty bad ass

3986
01:54:40,560 --> 01:54:41,393
years.

3987
01:54:41,960 --> 01:54:44,780
Like Mayans were wrong x 24 months,

3988
01:54:46,060 --> 01:54:49,100
although we don't know because those
fucking fighter jet that just went over,

3989
01:54:49,101 --> 01:54:49,920
hey,

3990
01:54:49,920 --> 01:54:50,890
what's going to happen

3991
01:54:53,110 --> 01:54:54,560
to run out of gas?

3992
01:54:54,860 --> 01:54:58,790
They're going to have to land
people overwhelming with slingshots.

3993
01:54:59,260 --> 01:54:59,930
Yeah,

3994
01:54:59,930 --> 01:55:00,291
I know.

3995
01:55:00,291 --> 01:55:02,000
If the world ended and we were right here,

3996
01:55:02,001 --> 01:55:02,750
be cool.

3997
01:55:02,750 --> 01:55:02,961
Joe,

3998
01:55:02,961 --> 01:55:07,460
was all of your adventures
that you go on space shuttle,

3999
01:55:07,461 --> 01:55:08,450
is that on the docket?

4000
01:55:08,750 --> 01:55:10,840
Put some fucking ice and
whiskey in that class.

4001
01:55:11,110 --> 01:55:12,140
He's talking about this shit.

4002
01:55:13,190 --> 01:55:15,300
This is what I think they think.

4003
01:55:16,120 --> 01:55:21,120
I'm available for space travel about
a decade into successful space.

4004
01:55:21,231 --> 01:55:23,240
Travel for civilians,

4005
01:55:23,390 --> 01:55:28,390
meaning once Richard Branson has hit
the 2029 marks and like pretty much no

4006
01:55:29,541 --> 01:55:30,374
one's dying.

4007
01:55:30,480 --> 01:55:31,700
Hilarity would have come at that.

4008
01:55:33,570 --> 01:55:35,180
Let them get all the kinks out.

4009
01:55:35,210 --> 01:55:35,781
You know what I mean?

4010
01:55:35,781 --> 01:55:36,740
Iron that shirt out.

4011
01:55:36,770 --> 01:55:41,770
Let those overeager motherfuckers
think I remember that.

4012
01:55:44,870 --> 01:55:45,703
Yeah.

4013
01:55:45,990 --> 01:55:46,830
Well how about the people?

4014
01:55:46,831 --> 01:55:51,660
There's over a hundred thousand people
that have signed up as potential people

4015
01:55:51,661 --> 01:55:56,661
to live on more or be the
first people to move to Mars.

4016
01:55:58,580 --> 01:55:59,070
No,

4017
01:55:59,070 --> 01:55:59,903
he made it.

4018
01:56:01,370 --> 01:56:02,280
How do you do that?

4019
01:56:02,430 --> 01:56:03,263
You just breathe in.

4020
01:56:03,970 --> 01:56:07,740
I think it's a male face and
it makes different noises.

4021
01:56:11,670 --> 01:56:12,503
Scared

4022
01:56:14,290 --> 01:56:15,130
needs pills.

4023
01:56:16,410 --> 01:56:20,460
Could you imagine if you move to Mars
and you found a fucking sign you were

4024
01:56:20,461 --> 01:56:21,001
digging,

4025
01:56:21,001 --> 01:56:22,290
like trying to plant tomatoes.

4026
01:56:22,410 --> 01:56:23,790
I think sign that said,

4027
01:56:23,791 --> 01:56:25,640
get the fuck out of here quick.

4028
01:56:26,400 --> 01:56:31,200
Do you guys remember that with ice
cube and it was about like Mars.

4029
01:56:31,350 --> 01:56:31,681
Fuck.

4030
01:56:31,681 --> 01:56:32,514
What was it called?

4031
01:56:33,390 --> 01:56:34,223
Friday

4032
01:56:35,910 --> 01:56:36,870
and people die.

4033
01:56:37,030 --> 01:56:37,701
Oh,

4034
01:56:37,701 --> 01:56:39,090
it was a John Carpenter movie.

4035
01:56:39,150 --> 01:56:40,200
Yeah,

4036
01:56:40,201 --> 01:56:40,860
I remember that.

4037
01:56:40,860 --> 01:56:43,890
I remember seeing that
when I was young teenager.

4038
01:56:43,950 --> 01:56:44,251
God,

4039
01:56:44,251 --> 01:56:45,790
I don't remember too much about that,

4040
01:56:45,791 --> 01:56:49,470
but there's some Mars movie
kind of like a Zombie.

4041
01:56:49,520 --> 01:56:50,790
It feel to it.

4042
01:56:52,390 --> 01:56:53,223
Well,

4043
01:56:53,880 --> 01:56:54,900
the idea of Mars,

4044
01:56:55,020 --> 01:56:55,561
to me,

4045
01:56:55,561 --> 01:56:58,500
it's like living in the shittiest
neighborhood of all time.

4046
01:56:58,860 --> 01:56:59,970
There's no plants,

4047
01:57:00,090 --> 01:57:01,680
there's no la air quality.

4048
01:57:01,681 --> 01:57:03,900
Can't go outside and even breathe the air.

4049
01:57:03,930 --> 01:57:05,710
You relying on human inventions

4050
01:57:07,280 --> 01:57:07,560
for,

4051
01:57:07,560 --> 01:57:08,430
how about the rest of your life,

4052
01:57:08,431 --> 01:57:09,264
bitch,

4053
01:57:10,520 --> 01:57:11,353
not you.

4054
01:57:11,850 --> 01:57:12,510
The person,

4055
01:57:12,510 --> 01:57:13,560
the person on the,

4056
01:57:13,710 --> 01:57:16,500
on the island of Mars itself.

4057
01:57:17,580 --> 01:57:20,310
You know the really scary thing about
Mars is when they keep finding all this

4058
01:57:20,311 --> 01:57:21,144
water on it,

4059
01:57:21,360 --> 01:57:25,560
they keep finding all these like former
rivers and former lakes and it makes

4060
01:57:25,561 --> 01:57:25,720
you,

4061
01:57:25,720 --> 01:57:30,720
it really cemented in your head that like
earth could be just like that one day.

4062
01:57:32,910 --> 01:57:33,121
Look,

4063
01:57:33,121 --> 01:57:36,150
we could get hit with not like
what killed all the dinosaurs,

4064
01:57:36,330 --> 01:57:37,950
but something fucking crazier.

4065
01:57:38,140 --> 01:57:41,430
You can get hit with some
instead of five miles wide.

4066
01:57:41,650 --> 01:57:41,940
Well,

4067
01:57:41,940 --> 01:57:42,151
yeah,

4068
01:57:42,151 --> 01:57:42,984
that can happen.

4069
01:57:43,620 --> 01:57:47,070
Hyper Novas like in a nearby
galaxy just cooks everything.

4070
01:57:47,400 --> 01:57:52,400
And some sometimes asteroidal impacts
planets collide and the fucking entire

4071
01:57:53,341 --> 01:57:54,990
atmosphere of the planet changes.

4072
01:57:55,110 --> 01:57:57,030
That's not just common.

4073
01:57:57,330 --> 01:57:59,730
It's the standard every fucking planet.

4074
01:57:59,731 --> 01:58:00,810
If you look at the moon,

4075
01:58:00,811 --> 01:58:01,644
if you look at Earth,

4076
01:58:01,930 --> 01:58:03,540
everything is littered with,

4077
01:58:03,730 --> 01:58:04,410
oh yeah.

4078
01:58:04,410 --> 01:58:09,410
Impacts every planet we've
are found littered with
astro people actually robots.

4079
01:58:10,920 --> 01:58:12,130
Do you think that uh,

4080
01:58:12,520 --> 01:58:17,520
we have the technological capacity to
prevent that kind of thing cause cause

4081
01:58:18,751 --> 01:58:22,680
we'd know it was coming at this point
or at least there's a good chance of it.

4082
01:58:23,250 --> 01:58:24,083
This is what I think.

4083
01:58:24,330 --> 01:58:29,160
Tell me everything other than what is
absolutely positive that we can do,

4084
01:58:29,161 --> 01:58:30,390
whether it's air travel,

4085
01:58:30,391 --> 01:58:32,250
whether it's a travel into space,

4086
01:58:32,251 --> 01:58:35,010
space stations is essentially theoretical.

4087
01:58:35,370 --> 01:58:35,850
Sure.

4088
01:58:35,850 --> 01:58:36,690
Unless we've done it,

4089
01:58:36,810 --> 01:58:38,130
they don't know we can do it.

4090
01:58:38,430 --> 01:58:40,950
They assume that we can get
away with going to Mars,

4091
01:58:41,260 --> 01:58:42,040
but it could

4092
01:58:42,040 --> 01:58:46,570
very well be that they get out into
deep space and they find out that the

4093
01:58:46,571 --> 01:58:48,100
magneto sphere and the,

4094
01:58:48,101 --> 01:58:48,271
the,

4095
01:58:48,271 --> 01:58:48,441
the,

4096
01:58:48,441 --> 01:58:49,181
the fucking,

4097
01:58:49,181 --> 01:58:53,050
the atmosphere of the earth is protecting
us his way in ways from like long

4098
01:58:53,051 --> 01:58:55,510
trips that we just don't
understand the possible risks,

4099
01:58:55,990 --> 01:58:58,270
especially radiation asteroids,

4100
01:58:58,271 --> 01:58:59,390
micro meteors what?

4101
01:58:59,500 --> 01:58:59,890
Sure.

4102
01:58:59,890 --> 01:59:00,723
You and your hands up.

4103
01:59:00,880 --> 01:59:01,713
Yes.

4104
01:59:02,410 --> 01:59:03,190
From honey honey.

4105
01:59:03,190 --> 01:59:04,240
What is the magnetosphere?

4106
01:59:04,850 --> 01:59:05,380
The,

4107
01:59:05,380 --> 01:59:06,400
well there's,

4108
01:59:06,430 --> 01:59:07,510
there's a surface.

4109
01:59:07,600 --> 01:59:08,020
Okay.

4110
01:59:08,020 --> 01:59:08,711
The of the earth,

4111
01:59:08,711 --> 01:59:09,010
right?

4112
01:59:09,010 --> 01:59:09,843
You got your dirt,

4113
01:59:10,040 --> 01:59:11,020
you got your water,

4114
01:59:11,110 --> 01:59:11,261
you know,

4115
01:59:11,261 --> 01:59:12,580
you got you what you can touch.

4116
01:59:12,760 --> 01:59:15,790
And then above it you have
various layers of gases.

4117
01:59:15,820 --> 01:59:16,930
You have oxygen,

4118
01:59:16,931 --> 01:59:18,280
you have the magneto sphere,

4119
01:59:18,310 --> 01:59:19,090
you have,

4120
01:59:19,090 --> 01:59:19,510
um,

4121
01:59:19,510 --> 01:59:20,390
you have uh,

4122
01:59:20,391 --> 01:59:21,940
an ozone you had,

4123
01:59:21,941 --> 01:59:24,250
there's a bunch of things
that surround the earth.

4124
01:59:25,140 --> 01:59:29,440
Here's one of the layers of the earth
made of guy would do a piss poor job of

4125
01:59:29,441 --> 01:59:31,900
describing it because obviously
my education is before,

4126
01:59:32,140 --> 01:59:37,030
but essentially what's going on is you
have the atmosphere of the planet and it

4127
01:59:37,031 --> 01:59:39,640
goes from say like one inch.

4128
01:59:39,640 --> 01:59:39,881
You know,

4129
01:59:39,881 --> 01:59:41,780
like the touching the ground too,

4130
01:59:41,800 --> 01:59:42,130
you know,

4131
01:59:42,130 --> 01:59:45,910
x amount of miles up into the sky until
we essentially start calling it space.

4132
01:59:46,300 --> 01:59:50,380
And then from there on you have
the van Allen radiation belts,

4133
01:59:50,381 --> 01:59:51,550
which engulf the earth,

4134
01:59:51,551 --> 01:59:52,630
these radiation belts,

4135
01:59:52,631 --> 01:59:53,550
which you know,

4136
01:59:53,551 --> 01:59:58,551
or like a doughnut shaped like band of
radiation than in circles the earth.

4137
01:59:58,810 --> 02:00:02,740
And then outside of that you have deep
space and there's no protection out

4138
02:00:02,741 --> 02:00:02,921
there.

4139
02:00:02,921 --> 02:00:03,581
All that other stuff,

4140
02:00:03,581 --> 02:00:04,331
the atmosphere,

4141
02:00:04,331 --> 02:00:09,250
all the other stuff protects us from
things like gamma rays from solar flares,

4142
02:00:09,550 --> 02:00:10,410
from um,

4143
02:00:10,520 --> 02:00:14,550
supernovas if like there was some sort
of a supernova in a nearby galaxy and

4144
02:00:14,560 --> 02:00:18,850
gamma rays when flying through the fucking
galaxy stuff that's unique to earth

4145
02:00:18,851 --> 02:00:20,860
or to no planets in general,

4146
02:00:20,950 --> 02:00:25,950
neither the atmospheres we know for a
fact is atmosphere is in many planets and

4147
02:00:26,831 --> 02:00:30,160
many different solar systems that
we found throughout the universe,

4148
02:00:30,340 --> 02:00:32,440
including binary Solon systems,

4149
02:00:32,441 --> 02:00:34,090
which means they have two different stars.

4150
02:00:34,090 --> 02:00:34,571
And then there's,

4151
02:00:34,571 --> 02:00:36,520
we've also detected simple gasses,

4152
02:00:36,521 --> 02:00:39,520
like different gases that
that exists on earth,

4153
02:00:39,521 --> 02:00:41,380
whether it's hydrogen or oxygen.

4154
02:00:41,560 --> 02:00:41,741
We,

4155
02:00:41,741 --> 02:00:43,600
they've detected those
on a lot of planets.

4156
02:00:43,601 --> 02:00:43,870
Now.

4157
02:00:43,870 --> 02:00:46,540
It was just a dick a decade ago when
they didn't know how many planets there

4158
02:00:46,541 --> 02:00:47,081
were out there.

4159
02:00:47,081 --> 02:00:47,914
It was just guessing,

4160
02:00:48,160 --> 02:00:50,140
but now they're just spotting
them left and right and they,

4161
02:00:50,590 --> 02:00:50,951
a lot of it,

4162
02:00:50,951 --> 02:00:55,750
they spot the star and then they see the
wobble of the star and they recognize

4163
02:00:55,751 --> 02:01:00,070
that something is spinning around the
star and that's something most likely as a

4164
02:01:00,071 --> 02:01:00,581
planet.

4165
02:01:00,581 --> 02:01:04,450
And then they can determine the mass of
the planet and then they can zoom in on

4166
02:01:04,451 --> 02:01:09,451
that spot and find out if
it's got hydrogen or oxygen
or whatever the fuck is on

4167
02:01:10,121 --> 02:01:10,954
that plan.

4168
02:01:11,050 --> 02:01:16,050
The likelihood that there are other
planets like ours and there it's 100% it's

4169
02:01:18,010 --> 02:01:19,420
this is what's really fucked up.

4170
02:01:19,480 --> 02:01:24,040
It's not only is there most
likely other planets like us,

4171
02:01:24,190 --> 02:01:26,680
but from the way it's
been explained to me,

4172
02:01:26,890 --> 02:01:31,890
the universe is so big that if infinity
is real and there's no reason to believe

4173
02:01:32,531 --> 02:01:33,910
that it's not wood.

4174
02:01:33,911 --> 02:01:36,760
Infinity means if the universe
truly has no boundaries,

4175
02:01:36,761 --> 02:01:39,710
and if there's infinite numbers
of universes like the same,

4176
02:01:40,100 --> 02:01:43,010
the same idea exist an
infinite number of times,

4177
02:01:43,011 --> 02:01:44,180
like an unmeasurable,

4178
02:01:44,181 --> 02:01:48,920
impossible number that there's another
Suzanne and other Ben out there sitting

4179
02:01:48,950 --> 02:01:52,610
on these shitty office Max Leather chairs,

4180
02:01:54,060 --> 02:01:54,893
comfy

4181
02:01:57,800 --> 02:01:59,150
nipple rings in a Dick.

4182
02:02:01,760 --> 02:02:02,860
Why not just switch it up?

4183
02:02:02,880 --> 02:02:03,561
Guarantee you.

4184
02:02:03,561 --> 02:02:07,210
There's another Suzanne out there with
a deck that has eyeballs and it's like

4185
02:02:07,700 --> 02:02:08,211
big Dick.

4186
02:02:08,211 --> 02:02:11,570
Every possibility that
you could think of exists.

4187
02:02:11,930 --> 02:02:14,570
This is what's really fucked up
about the concept of infinity.

4188
02:02:15,050 --> 02:02:17,420
Infinity literally means
there's no boundaries,

4189
02:02:17,421 --> 02:02:18,260
there's no end.

4190
02:02:18,500 --> 02:02:20,930
So it's not like you get to
a certain amount of time.

4191
02:02:20,931 --> 02:02:23,120
The raw carbon building blocks for life.

4192
02:02:23,121 --> 02:02:23,751
We've run out,

4193
02:02:23,751 --> 02:02:27,260
we've made all the giraffes and the
fucking cactuses and the palm trees.

4194
02:02:27,410 --> 02:02:31,310
We don't have any room for us who's
hand with a giant Dick and incorrect.

4195
02:02:31,490 --> 02:02:35,540
We have another fucking infinite
number of universes with infinite solar

4196
02:02:35,541 --> 02:02:36,374
systems,

4197
02:02:36,470 --> 02:02:37,730
infinite galaxies,

4198
02:02:37,731 --> 02:02:41,300
and inside one of those
somewhere a billion,

4199
02:02:41,300 --> 02:02:42,980
trillion fucking zillion miles away.

4200
02:02:43,160 --> 02:02:44,240
There's another Suzanne.

4201
02:02:44,300 --> 02:02:46,190
But this is coming from
a point of complete,

4202
02:02:46,490 --> 02:02:47,031
not complete,

4203
02:02:47,031 --> 02:02:47,541
but like a,

4204
02:02:47,541 --> 02:02:49,220
a decent amount of ignorance,

4205
02:02:49,580 --> 02:02:52,970
but what can you get to speak English?

4206
02:02:52,980 --> 02:02:57,980
So I was under the impression that
there's still the understanding that the

4207
02:02:58,461 --> 02:03:01,250
universe is contracting Doosan degree,

4208
02:03:01,970 --> 02:03:05,180
what's supposed to be currently
expanding but will eventually contract.

4209
02:03:05,200 --> 02:03:05,421
But,

4210
02:03:05,421 --> 02:03:06,254
but that speaks to,

4211
02:03:06,500 --> 02:03:07,610
uh,

4212
02:03:07,910 --> 02:03:08,750
perimeters.

4213
02:03:09,290 --> 02:03:09,620
Well,

4214
02:03:09,620 --> 02:03:12,620
the problem is when you talk
about this kind of stuff,

4215
02:03:12,650 --> 02:03:15,830
especially if it's a guy like you who's
a musician or a gog means an idiot.

4216
02:03:15,860 --> 02:03:16,281
We're really,

4217
02:03:16,281 --> 02:03:17,114
we don't know what,

4218
02:03:17,930 --> 02:03:19,160
we don't know what the fuck you're saying.

4219
02:03:19,460 --> 02:03:22,640
So we're just basically
parroting what we've heard.

4220
02:03:22,641 --> 02:03:23,590
Like legitimates,

4221
02:03:24,450 --> 02:03:24,920
degrass,

4222
02:03:24,920 --> 02:03:25,431
Tyson,

4223
02:03:25,431 --> 02:03:26,360
Michio Kaku,

4224
02:03:26,361 --> 02:03:31,361
astrophysicist type dudes actually like
do the calculations and figure it out.

4225
02:03:31,551 --> 02:03:32,211
And I think that,

4226
02:03:32,211 --> 02:03:33,044
um,

4227
02:03:33,320 --> 02:03:37,010
there's a lot of debate about what
we know and what we're sure of.

4228
02:03:37,040 --> 02:03:39,080
And sometimes those
things come into question.

4229
02:03:39,081 --> 02:03:40,340
Like lately there's a guy,

4230
02:03:40,400 --> 02:03:43,910
there's a new guy who is claiming
that black holes don't exist.

4231
02:03:44,150 --> 02:03:47,780
And this is like a really recent study
that a lot of people are taking very

4232
02:03:47,781 --> 02:03:48,614
seriously.

4233
02:03:48,680 --> 02:03:52,610
And this guy has said that black holes
as we know them do not exist because it's

4234
02:03:52,611 --> 02:03:53,750
kind of showing this room though.

4235
02:03:54,230 --> 02:03:55,010
What's that?

4236
02:03:55,010 --> 02:03:55,800
Five in this room?

4237
02:03:55,800 --> 02:03:58,190
Five black holes is not black.

4238
02:03:58,310 --> 02:03:59,390
It's not even Brown.

4239
02:03:59,630 --> 02:04:00,590
It's like a red.

4240
02:04:01,980 --> 02:04:03,140
You should get that looked at.

4241
02:04:03,530 --> 02:04:03,971
Here's it.

4242
02:04:03,971 --> 02:04:04,550
Here it is.

4243
02:04:04,550 --> 02:04:05,420
This is the theory.

4244
02:04:05,620 --> 02:04:07,100
Black holes do not exist.

4245
02:04:07,910 --> 02:04:09,530
But think about it like the big bang.

4246
02:04:09,950 --> 02:04:10,783
This did not.

4247
02:04:10,820 --> 02:04:12,920
The big bank did not
exist a hundred years ago,

4248
02:04:12,921 --> 02:04:13,581
a hundred years ago,

4249
02:04:13,581 --> 02:04:17,360
and people riding around on horses and
fucking doing any Oakley fucking shooting

4250
02:04:17,361 --> 02:04:17,980
galleries with,

4251
02:04:17,980 --> 02:04:18,550
oh,

4252
02:04:18,550 --> 02:04:21,050
like looking at a fucking mirror
and shooting over their shoulder.

4253
02:04:21,200 --> 02:04:23,540
It was a greatest thing
you could ever do that.

4254
02:04:23,541 --> 02:04:25,100
No one knew what the
fuck the big bang was.

4255
02:04:25,130 --> 02:04:27,320
No one had any idea why
the stars were in the sky.

4256
02:04:27,530 --> 02:04:28,370
And now we know.

4257
02:04:28,700 --> 02:04:29,600
But this guy,

4258
02:04:29,640 --> 02:04:31,190
this recent guy,

4259
02:04:31,400 --> 02:04:31,820
uh,

4260
02:04:31,820 --> 02:04:31,911
or,

4261
02:04:31,911 --> 02:04:32,660
excuse me,

4262
02:04:32,660 --> 02:04:33,493
it's a woman.

4263
02:04:33,800 --> 02:04:34,633
What?

4264
02:04:35,540 --> 02:04:39,240
Then of course I'll only wrong
would try to take away the bay.

4265
02:04:39,420 --> 02:04:41,130
You fucking bitch.

4266
02:04:41,520 --> 02:04:42,570
I'm sorry ma'am.

4267
02:04:42,600 --> 02:04:43,080
I do it.

4268
02:04:43,080 --> 02:04:43,980
I was only kidding.

4269
02:04:44,130 --> 02:04:44,520
Boy.

4270
02:04:44,520 --> 02:04:44,791
Her,

4271
02:04:44,791 --> 02:04:48,840
her name is professor Laura Mursine.

4272
02:04:49,170 --> 02:04:51,900
H O.

4273
02:04:51,900 --> 02:04:51,900
U.

4274
02:04:51,900 --> 02:04:51,900
G.

4275
02:04:51,900 --> 02:04:51,900
H.

4276
02:04:51,900 --> 02:04:51,900
T.

4277
02:04:51,900 --> 02:04:51,900
O.

4278
02:04:51,900 --> 02:04:51,930
N.

4279
02:04:51,930 --> 02:04:52,850
How can I help tone?

4280
02:04:53,020 --> 02:04:56,670
How often said she is still
in shock from the fine.

4281
02:04:56,910 --> 02:04:57,360
Uh,

4282
02:04:57,360 --> 02:05:01,380
previously scientists thought the stars
were much larger than the sun collapsed

4283
02:05:01,680 --> 02:05:02,580
under a,

4284
02:05:02,700 --> 02:05:06,600
their own sons collapse under their own
gravity and formed black holes when they

4285
02:05:06,601 --> 02:05:07,434
died.

4286
02:05:07,530 --> 02:05:12,360
And during this process they release
a type of radiation called Hawking

4287
02:05:12,361 --> 02:05:12,901
radiation.

4288
02:05:12,901 --> 02:05:17,580
But new research claims the star would
lose too much mass and wouldn't be able

4289
02:05:17,581 --> 02:05:18,690
to form a black hole.

4290
02:05:18,840 --> 02:05:19,950
And if this is true,

4291
02:05:20,100 --> 02:05:24,600
the theory that the universe began as a
singularity followed by a big bang could

4292
02:05:24,630 --> 02:05:25,590
also be wrong.

4293
02:05:25,800 --> 02:05:27,210
I don't understand a word you said,

4294
02:05:30,180 --> 02:05:31,200
it's quite interesting,

4295
02:05:31,230 --> 02:05:35,910
but by the dissolution of historic
can't have this ultimately dense,

4296
02:05:36,510 --> 02:05:37,470
ultimately small,

4297
02:05:37,471 --> 02:05:38,304
infinitely dense,

4298
02:05:38,310 --> 02:05:40,020
infinitely small ball of matter,

4299
02:05:40,021 --> 02:05:41,280
which creates the big man.

4300
02:05:42,180 --> 02:05:43,080
I don't know.

4301
02:05:43,110 --> 02:05:43,731
I don't,

4302
02:05:43,731 --> 02:05:44,540
I don't like,

4303
02:05:44,540 --> 02:05:47,880
is this where we're dumb
and even bothering to have
this conversation because I

4304
02:05:47,881 --> 02:05:48,860
think his shit is,

4305
02:05:49,320 --> 02:05:52,410
this is beyond like the
great minds of our time.

4306
02:05:52,411 --> 02:05:54,270
This is one of those things
where there's no conclusion.

4307
02:05:54,271 --> 02:05:55,104
That's contract.

4308
02:05:58,310 --> 02:05:59,143
Really started it.

4309
02:05:59,760 --> 02:06:00,960
Time to move in.

4310
02:06:00,961 --> 02:06:01,081
Yeah.

4311
02:06:01,081 --> 02:06:06,081
You guys want to set up the
microphones to give her a guitar.

4312
02:06:06,480 --> 02:06:07,111
She wakes up.

4313
02:06:07,111 --> 02:06:08,880
She'll start singing like an angel.

4314
02:06:10,110 --> 02:06:11,550
I was with you the whole time.

4315
02:06:11,560 --> 02:06:12,393
I'm like,

4316
02:06:12,990 --> 02:06:13,530
Oh,

4317
02:06:13,530 --> 02:06:14,670
I'm not even with me.

4318
02:06:15,360 --> 02:06:16,200
I'm not even with me.

4319
02:06:16,201 --> 02:06:17,250
I don't understand it.

4320
02:06:17,270 --> 02:06:17,781
Here I'll do.

4321
02:06:17,781 --> 02:06:19,040
My question is when it says,

4322
02:06:19,550 --> 02:06:20,120
please,

4323
02:06:20,120 --> 02:06:21,440
when a huge star,

4324
02:06:21,500 --> 02:06:24,860
many times the mass of the sun
comes to the end of its life,

4325
02:06:24,861 --> 02:06:29,861
it collapses in on itself and forms a
singularity creating a black hole where

4326
02:06:30,741 --> 02:06:35,090
gravity is so strong that not
even light itself can escape.

4327
02:06:36,170 --> 02:06:39,050
At least that's what we thought.

4328
02:06:40,250 --> 02:06:43,760
As scientist has sensationally said,

4329
02:06:43,820 --> 02:06:48,820
it is impossible for a black holes to
exist and she even has the mathematical

4330
02:06:51,561 --> 02:06:53,930
proof to back up our claims.

4331
02:06:54,280 --> 02:06:54,700
I need to,

4332
02:06:54,700 --> 02:06:58,240
I should work at 14 and see true.

4333
02:06:58,610 --> 02:07:03,610
Her research could force physicist to
scrap their theories of how the universe

4334
02:07:04,161 --> 02:07:05,030
began.

4335
02:07:05,660 --> 02:07:08,150
The research was conducted

4336
02:07:08,460 --> 02:07:11,950
by Professor Laura Marcy Ni.

4337
02:07:12,120 --> 02:07:15,150
How often from the
University of North Carolina.

4338
02:07:15,180 --> 02:07:15,480
Oh,

4339
02:07:15,480 --> 02:07:16,313
I lost interest.

4340
02:07:18,300 --> 02:07:19,111
Did you say Harvard?

4341
02:07:19,111 --> 02:07:19,630
You didn't.

4342
02:07:19,630 --> 02:07:20,401
You say MIT.

4343
02:07:20,401 --> 02:07:21,234
I didn't hear that.

4344
02:07:21,240 --> 02:07:22,680
I heard the University of North Carolina

4345
02:07:24,740 --> 02:07:27,520
Ivy League in hard for what?

4346
02:07:27,521 --> 02:07:30,630
I said Umass Boston.

4347
02:07:30,900 --> 02:07:31,980
He went to Umass,

4348
02:07:32,070 --> 02:07:32,520
barely,

4349
02:07:32,520 --> 02:07:35,100
barely went to Umass Boston for three.

4350
02:07:35,380 --> 02:07:36,040
Holy Shit.

4351
02:07:36,040 --> 02:07:36,873
Wasted my time.

4352
02:07:36,910 --> 02:07:40,630
I only went when like the
continuing education program.

4353
02:07:40,631 --> 02:07:41,830
I didn't even take my sats.

4354
02:07:42,150 --> 02:07:43,390
I the only reason.

4355
02:07:43,430 --> 02:07:44,263
Thank you.

4356
02:07:44,680 --> 02:07:46,550
I did good for you.

4357
02:07:47,350 --> 02:07:47,550
Okay.

4358
02:07:47,550 --> 02:07:48,383
Yeah.

4359
02:07:48,820 --> 02:07:51,730
You low lives parole,

4360
02:07:51,880 --> 02:07:56,860
living your life without proving
yourself and 18 not doing that.

4361
02:07:57,220 --> 02:07:58,053
No.

4362
02:07:58,480 --> 02:07:59,050
Uber.

4363
02:07:59,050 --> 02:07:59,830
It's here.

4364
02:07:59,830 --> 02:08:00,663
It's real.

4365
02:08:00,670 --> 02:08:01,351
We have a driver.

4366
02:08:01,351 --> 02:08:02,184
It's also,

4367
02:08:02,410 --> 02:08:04,570
we have a number we lived on.

4368
02:08:06,060 --> 02:08:06,893
Um,

4369
02:08:08,230 --> 02:08:09,063
what do you think?

4370
02:08:14,080 --> 02:08:14,891
What were we talking about?

4371
02:08:14,891 --> 02:08:15,611
Proletariat.

4372
02:08:15,611 --> 02:08:16,031
Umass.

4373
02:08:16,031 --> 02:08:16,450
Boston's.

4374
02:08:16,450 --> 02:08:17,010
Yeah.

4375
02:08:17,010 --> 02:08:17,470
I went,

4376
02:08:17,470 --> 02:08:20,800
I only went because I was worried that
people thought I was a loser when I got

4377
02:08:20,801 --> 02:08:21,311
out of high school.

4378
02:08:21,311 --> 02:08:23,020
I had no idea what it's going
to do and I kept telling him,

4379
02:08:23,021 --> 02:08:24,610
but I'm just going to take a year off.

4380
02:08:24,790 --> 02:08:28,090
And what I would tell girls that they
would look at me with such disdain.

4381
02:08:28,210 --> 02:08:28,780
Fuck,

4382
02:08:28,780 --> 02:08:29,770
that's what I did.

4383
02:08:31,130 --> 02:08:31,860
Absolutely.

4384
02:08:31,860 --> 02:08:35,010
You had to go to college because that's
what everybody in your class did.

4385
02:08:35,011 --> 02:08:38,740
And if you said you weren't going or
you didn't know by you graduated high

4386
02:08:38,741 --> 02:08:39,574
school,

4387
02:08:39,580 --> 02:08:40,150
people were like,

4388
02:08:40,150 --> 02:08:41,740
oh shit,

4389
02:08:41,770 --> 02:08:42,603
I didn't go.

4390
02:08:43,030 --> 02:08:44,810
I didn't experience that
kind of discrimination.

4391
02:08:44,811 --> 02:08:45,251
But well,

4392
02:08:45,251 --> 02:08:46,390
it's not discrimination.

4393
02:08:46,391 --> 02:08:51,391
It's wanting you to live up to a certain
quality of work ethic and standard.

4394
02:08:52,450 --> 02:08:53,350
Where I grew up,

4395
02:08:54,130 --> 02:08:54,851
I lived in Newton,

4396
02:08:54,851 --> 02:08:56,860
Massachusetts and Newton,

4397
02:08:57,380 --> 02:08:58,213
Newton,

4398
02:08:58,290 --> 02:08:59,360
Newton Mush,

4399
02:08:59,770 --> 02:09:00,430
Newton north,

4400
02:09:00,430 --> 02:09:01,510
they called each other mush.

4401
02:09:01,690 --> 02:09:05,330
It's one of the only places
on earth where Mush like what?

4402
02:09:05,331 --> 02:09:06,580
Up Mush Mush.

4403
02:09:06,730 --> 02:09:08,470
You seen his fucking broad mush.

4404
02:09:08,800 --> 02:09:11,860
She's got a big ass mush
cross didn't have big assets.

4405
02:09:11,861 --> 02:09:12,694
What else is,

4406
02:09:13,390 --> 02:09:14,380
it doesn't mean anything,

4407
02:09:14,830 --> 02:09:17,590
but there's an area of
news called the lake.

4408
02:09:17,620 --> 02:09:18,610
The audible comma.

4409
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:19,570
No,

4410
02:09:19,570 --> 02:09:20,890
no dude,

4411
02:09:20,891 --> 02:09:22,070
it's their version of dues.

4412
02:09:22,570 --> 02:09:24,480
It's their version of dude who do

4413
02:09:26,680 --> 02:09:28,550
it was mush when I grew up in,

4414
02:09:28,600 --> 02:09:30,760
I grew up in Newton south
and I didn't get much.

4415
02:09:30,850 --> 02:09:34,090
But my good friends Kevin Chase on
and my good friends nick to Teleo,

4416
02:09:34,300 --> 02:09:36,490
they both went to Newton north.

4417
02:09:37,120 --> 02:09:37,953
Okay.

4418
02:09:38,180 --> 02:09:38,290
Uh,

4419
02:09:38,290 --> 02:09:40,360
Newton North was different
than Newton South Jimmy laws.

4420
02:09:40,361 --> 02:09:41,081
What's new south,

4421
02:09:41,081 --> 02:09:41,950
who's also my good friend.

4422
02:09:42,250 --> 02:09:42,821
And we,

4423
02:09:42,821 --> 02:09:43,150
uh,

4424
02:09:43,150 --> 02:09:44,200
his name is lawless.

4425
02:09:44,230 --> 02:09:46,420
Jimmy motherfucking Lawler.

4426
02:09:46,430 --> 02:09:47,410
Still my friend

4427
02:09:50,070 --> 02:09:51,890
Michael Law changes you.

4428
02:09:51,910 --> 02:09:52,743
That's his name.

4429
02:09:53,340 --> 02:09:54,460
Just like Getty Bravo.

4430
02:09:54,461 --> 02:09:55,550
That's another one of my friends.

4431
02:09:56,740 --> 02:09:57,790
More proof.

4432
02:09:57,880 --> 02:09:59,230
We're living in a simulation.

4433
02:10:01,090 --> 02:10:04,810
You guys are itching to rock this patient.

4434
02:10:04,811 --> 02:10:04,991
No,

4435
02:10:04,991 --> 02:10:05,824
you are.

4436
02:10:07,260 --> 02:10:08,170
I need to say anymore.

4437
02:10:09,010 --> 02:10:10,150
Bush was cool.

4438
02:10:10,151 --> 02:10:10,984
They were trapped.

4439
02:10:11,080 --> 02:10:13,240
They were living in a place where
it snows six months out of the year.

4440
02:10:13,370 --> 02:10:14,260
Know I lived in Madison.

4441
02:10:14,530 --> 02:10:17,770
There was a prince song called
sometimes it snows in April.

4442
02:10:18,060 --> 02:10:18,410
Yeah,

4443
02:10:18,410 --> 02:10:19,243
very sad song.

4444
02:10:19,390 --> 02:10:22,000
Sometimes it's snow.

4445
02:10:22,010 --> 02:10:23,700
It's also prince called song called.

4446
02:10:26,180 --> 02:10:30,110
Sometimes he feels so bad.

4447
02:10:30,280 --> 02:10:32,080
I was in my Audi Fox.

4448
02:10:32,290 --> 02:10:32,561
Okay.

4449
02:10:32,561 --> 02:10:33,980
I was coming home from my,

4450
02:10:34,130 --> 02:10:39,130
my gig where I was driving a private
investigator that lost his job.

4451
02:10:39,310 --> 02:10:43,520
He lost his driver's license because he
was Dui and he needed someone to drive

4452
02:10:43,521 --> 02:10:44,001
him around,

4453
02:10:44,001 --> 02:10:48,230
so he put out an ad in the want ads for
an assistant for private investigator.

4454
02:10:48,231 --> 02:10:49,250
His name was dynamite.

4455
02:10:49,251 --> 02:10:50,240
Dickless Dave Dolan.

4456
02:10:50,770 --> 02:10:54,440
He's also still my good
friend from Boston.

4457
02:10:54,980 --> 02:10:55,191
Look,

4458
02:10:55,191 --> 02:10:56,330
I wouldn't go back to Boston,

4459
02:10:56,331 --> 02:10:57,710
but that mother fucker shaped me.

4460
02:10:58,080 --> 02:10:58,913
Okay.

4461
02:10:58,970 --> 02:10:59,803
Anyway,

4462
02:11:00,220 --> 02:11:02,060
that's driving back in April.

4463
02:11:02,130 --> 02:11:04,160
Snellen listened to Prince.

4464
02:11:04,490 --> 02:11:06,710
Sometimes it snows.

4465
02:11:06,711 --> 02:11:07,221
And I was like,

4466
02:11:07,221 --> 02:11:08,780
I gotta get the fuck out of Boston

4467
02:11:11,210 --> 02:11:11,541
kid.

4468
02:11:11,541 --> 02:11:12,830
Deal with snow in April.

4469
02:11:13,160 --> 02:11:14,480
Like what'd you get bombed?

4470
02:11:14,680 --> 02:11:15,650
I got blues all the time.

4471
02:11:15,651 --> 02:11:16,484
I was a loser.

4472
02:11:17,330 --> 02:11:18,620
I think that that's fair.

4473
02:11:18,621 --> 02:11:19,454
Everybody does that.

4474
02:11:19,630 --> 02:11:22,850
Well if you're super desperate and
you're trying to carve your path in this

4475
02:11:22,851 --> 02:11:25,820
world with a rabid desperation like I was,

4476
02:11:26,090 --> 02:11:26,870
you're always,

4477
02:11:26,870 --> 02:11:27,890
you're always feeling like shit.

4478
02:11:27,891 --> 02:11:28,370
Sure.

4479
02:11:28,370 --> 02:11:29,480
Cause if you're not feeling like shit,

4480
02:11:29,481 --> 02:11:30,380
you feeling complacent,

4481
02:11:30,410 --> 02:11:31,250
feel completion,

4482
02:11:31,610 --> 02:11:32,443
nothing gets done.

4483
02:11:32,870 --> 02:11:33,521
Well you know the,

4484
02:11:33,521 --> 02:11:34,900
the blues come and go like that.

4485
02:11:34,910 --> 02:11:36,800
That's just inevitable
I think at this point.

4486
02:11:36,830 --> 02:11:41,570
And when you accept it and you figured
out what it is and what it means and you

4487
02:11:41,571 --> 02:11:42,404
just keep,

4488
02:11:42,470 --> 02:11:43,040
you know,

4489
02:11:43,040 --> 02:11:45,500
under having an understanding
with yourself and

4490
02:11:45,720 --> 02:11:46,920
oh it's important that a certain,

4491
02:11:47,040 --> 02:11:48,750
a certain type of people,

4492
02:11:48,780 --> 02:11:49,680
like people that you listen to,

4493
02:11:49,681 --> 02:11:54,120
like someone like you or like
you or like you guys name their,

4494
02:11:54,121 --> 02:11:55,020
their reality,

4495
02:11:55,050 --> 02:11:58,260
like talk about the reality and talk
about the blues and then everybody goes,

4496
02:11:58,380 --> 02:11:59,850
oh I get it.

4497
02:12:00,150 --> 02:12:01,470
It's just a part of struggling.

4498
02:12:01,930 --> 02:12:02,131
They can.

4499
02:12:02,131 --> 02:12:03,270
Part is struggling is,

4500
02:12:04,340 --> 02:12:09,340
but I think you guys are super talented
and we've been friends for years now and

4501
02:12:09,571 --> 02:12:12,950
I've always thought you guys are super
talented from the moment I saw that that

4502
02:12:13,140 --> 02:12:17,160
one song where you guys were on top of
the roof and you were saying an angel of

4503
02:12:17,161 --> 02:12:17,460
death.

4504
02:12:17,460 --> 02:12:18,450
I love you guys so much too.

4505
02:12:18,810 --> 02:12:19,800
I think you guys are amazing.

4506
02:12:20,010 --> 02:12:21,130
But when,

4507
02:12:21,170 --> 02:12:21,571
when you,

4508
02:12:21,571 --> 02:12:22,141
when you,

4509
02:12:22,141 --> 02:12:26,100
when you connect with something like
that and you see someone who's doing

4510
02:12:26,101 --> 02:12:28,170
something that like makes you like,

4511
02:12:28,680 --> 02:12:32,370
it makes you feel good when you see it
and you want to spread it to these other

4512
02:12:32,371 --> 02:12:33,204
people,

4513
02:12:33,990 --> 02:12:35,840
it's like what?

4514
02:12:35,850 --> 02:12:36,151
What,

4515
02:12:36,151 --> 02:12:36,984
what is that?

4516
02:12:37,360 --> 02:12:38,480
What that is at the,

4517
02:12:38,481 --> 02:12:43,481
at its best it's like this is weird
light that you can find the deep dark

4518
02:12:43,771 --> 02:12:48,240
tunnels of human creativity that makes
you feel better about the struggle.

4519
02:12:48,570 --> 02:12:51,210
I like the fact that you
guys haven't made it.

4520
02:12:51,410 --> 02:12:51,880
I'm really

4521
02:12:51,880 --> 02:12:52,713
sorry.

4522
02:12:53,400 --> 02:12:53,860
I'm not,

4523
02:12:53,860 --> 02:12:54,520
I'm not,

4524
02:12:54,520 --> 02:12:55,720
I wish you had made it.

4525
02:12:55,750 --> 02:12:57,820
I wish you were multi-multi
multimillionaires.

4526
02:12:57,930 --> 02:12:58,420
I think,

4527
02:12:58,420 --> 02:13:02,970
and I know that it's come to and I know
you're not going to change then I buy

4528
02:13:02,971 --> 02:13:03,310
shit.

4529
02:13:03,310 --> 02:13:04,143
You say love

4530
02:13:04,890 --> 02:13:05,670
you guys.

4531
02:13:05,670 --> 02:13:07,770
When you were in the fucking,

4532
02:13:08,130 --> 02:13:11,400
you were in the God damn roots of it all.

4533
02:13:11,730 --> 02:13:13,050
You were swinging,

4534
02:13:13,440 --> 02:13:13,831
you know,

4535
02:13:13,831 --> 02:13:17,790
you guys are sleeping on
couches and fucking jam out.

4536
02:13:17,910 --> 02:13:20,730
You guys did that December 21st
show that we did at the Wiltern.

4537
02:13:20,860 --> 02:13:21,041
Yeah,

4538
02:13:21,041 --> 02:13:22,360
that kept us 2012.

4539
02:13:24,760 --> 02:13:25,330
Thank you.

4540
02:13:25,330 --> 02:13:27,730
Thank you that you guys
fucking crushed it.

4541
02:13:27,910 --> 02:13:28,980
I'll never forget Joey,

4542
02:13:29,350 --> 02:13:30,250
Joey Diaz,

4543
02:13:30,970 --> 02:13:35,190
Eddie Bravo came backstage after you guys
got off stage before a Dunkin went up

4544
02:13:36,060 --> 02:13:37,780
or Joey went up and uh,

4545
02:13:37,860 --> 02:13:39,360
he came up stage or was it?

4546
02:13:39,361 --> 02:13:39,571
Yeah,

4547
02:13:39,571 --> 02:13:41,460
it was Joey and then Doug Stanhope.

4548
02:13:41,820 --> 02:13:43,170
So before Joey went up,

4549
02:13:43,320 --> 02:13:44,310
you guys were on stage,

4550
02:13:44,311 --> 02:13:45,540
you were fucking killing it.

4551
02:13:45,750 --> 02:13:48,990
And Joey came backstage with Eddie Bravo
and they're both shaking their head

4552
02:13:48,991 --> 02:13:50,670
back and forth and they just go,

4553
02:13:50,970 --> 02:13:52,200
that's bad ass bitch.

4554
02:13:52,650 --> 02:13:54,080
That is a bad ass.

4555
02:13:54,081 --> 02:13:56,490
Because they kept saying
that and then Joey Goes,

4556
02:13:56,491 --> 02:13:57,420
God damn,

4557
02:13:57,421 --> 02:13:58,950
those motherfuckers are talented.

4558
02:13:59,130 --> 02:14:00,570
And a bravo was just shaking and said,

4559
02:14:00,571 --> 02:14:01,081
God damn,

4560
02:14:01,081 --> 02:14:02,050
those motherfuckers a talent.

4561
02:14:02,750 --> 02:14:03,750
And then they both go,

4562
02:14:03,751 --> 02:14:05,370
how are they not famous as fuck?

4563
02:14:05,430 --> 02:14:06,810
How would they not famous as fuck?

4564
02:14:06,960 --> 02:14:10,080
Like it became like a conversation
before the rest of the show went on.

4565
02:14:10,290 --> 02:14:10,711
Like you,

4566
02:14:10,711 --> 02:14:13,350
you guys were just fucking crushing it.

4567
02:14:13,380 --> 02:14:14,970
I don't even remember what song it was,

4568
02:14:15,330 --> 02:14:16,140
but they were just,

4569
02:14:16,140 --> 02:14:19,110
Eddie Bravo was holding his hands on his
head like the fucking home alone kid.

4570
02:14:19,111 --> 02:14:19,944
And he was saying,

4571
02:14:20,120 --> 02:14:20,610
he was like,

4572
02:14:20,610 --> 02:14:21,421
God damn,

4573
02:14:21,421 --> 02:14:22,680
they're really good.

4574
02:14:22,980 --> 02:14:23,371
And I go,

4575
02:14:23,371 --> 02:14:24,250
I told you dude,

4576
02:14:24,260 --> 02:14:25,110
they're really good.

4577
02:14:25,170 --> 02:14:26,280
He's such a nice dude.

4578
02:14:26,340 --> 02:14:27,390
They're both nice dudes.

4579
02:14:27,420 --> 02:14:28,020
Thanks man.

4580
02:14:28,020 --> 02:14:28,741
But if you're saying no,

4581
02:14:28,741 --> 02:14:29,940
that really sweet stuff,

4582
02:14:29,970 --> 02:14:33,170
I like the fact that I knew
you guys when you went shit,

4583
02:14:36,800 --> 02:14:38,250
but you where you were,

4584
02:14:38,251 --> 02:14:38,880
but you weren't.

4585
02:14:38,880 --> 02:14:42,570
It's like I love the fact that there's
something out there that's it's as good

4586
02:14:42,571 --> 02:14:44,520
or better than anything else,

4587
02:14:44,670 --> 02:14:45,780
but people don't know yet.

4588
02:14:45,870 --> 02:14:46,650
They don't know yet.

4589
02:14:46,650 --> 02:14:49,080
And you guys are out to just
fucking chipping away at it.

4590
02:14:49,260 --> 02:14:50,400
And slowly people are going,

4591
02:14:50,550 --> 02:14:51,240
Whoa,

4592
02:14:51,240 --> 02:14:51,760
Lee.

4593
02:14:51,760 --> 02:14:52,450
Fuck.

4594
02:14:52,450 --> 02:14:55,370
And that's what happens in this
world and it makes it better.

4595
02:14:55,370 --> 02:14:56,191
I honestly,

4596
02:14:56,191 --> 02:14:56,820
I,

4597
02:14:56,820 --> 02:14:58,170
I feel good about it.

4598
02:14:58,290 --> 02:14:58,891
You know what I mean?

4599
02:14:58,891 --> 02:14:59,490
I feel,

4600
02:14:59,490 --> 02:15:03,960
I feel all this all this
time we're putting in now
and who cares what happens on

4601
02:15:04,020 --> 02:15:04,201
Ben.

4602
02:15:04,201 --> 02:15:05,610
I don't picture you in bed with David.

4603
02:15:05,611 --> 02:15:06,660
Bowie is going to happen.

4604
02:15:06,730 --> 02:15:07,760
That shit happen tonight.

4605
02:15:07,770 --> 02:15:08,603
I know it's

4606
02:15:10,130 --> 02:15:11,010
taking a longer,

4607
02:15:11,011 --> 02:15:11,844
stronger row.

4608
02:15:12,780 --> 02:15:16,020
You get to know who you are by the time
you get in bed with David Bowie and you

4609
02:15:16,021 --> 02:15:16,231
go,

4610
02:15:16,231 --> 02:15:17,250
you're going to go like call me.

4611
02:15:17,251 --> 02:15:18,510
I love the music.

4612
02:15:18,780 --> 02:15:19,613
I love,

4613
02:15:19,650 --> 02:15:20,580
I love your music.

4614
02:15:21,340 --> 02:15:23,370
I'm going to fucking give you
a hug and I'm going to go home.

4615
02:15:23,530 --> 02:15:25,260
It's actually a express
ourselves differently.

4616
02:15:28,140 --> 02:15:29,100
Mutual respect,

4617
02:15:29,460 --> 02:15:30,360
no touching.

4618
02:15:30,390 --> 02:15:33,060
I think it's super important
to go through that struggle.

4619
02:15:33,061 --> 02:15:37,320
I think that if you guys had somehow or
another like started out together and

4620
02:15:37,321 --> 02:15:39,120
then a week later someone
came along and went,

4621
02:15:39,121 --> 02:15:39,931
Holy Shit,

4622
02:15:39,931 --> 02:15:41,370
you guys are fucking great.

4623
02:15:43,190 --> 02:15:43,460
Not

4624
02:15:43,460 --> 02:15:43,761
that,

4625
02:15:43,761 --> 02:15:44,594
but it didn't.

4626
02:15:45,360 --> 02:15:46,193
That's dead.

4627
02:15:46,280 --> 02:15:47,690
But that's what's so cool about,

4628
02:15:47,691 --> 02:15:48,524
like,

4629
02:15:49,100 --> 02:15:50,330
everyone has a different,

4630
02:15:50,900 --> 02:15:52,100
different way to get there,

4631
02:15:52,240 --> 02:15:52,820
you know,

4632
02:15:52,820 --> 02:15:53,780
different vehicle.

4633
02:15:54,080 --> 02:15:54,680
And,

4634
02:15:54,680 --> 02:15:55,400
um,

4635
02:15:55,400 --> 02:15:59,630
I think about that a lot because we've
been through so much shit together.

4636
02:15:59,631 --> 02:16:03,530
We've been through so much in our
personal lives and in the career.

4637
02:16:03,890 --> 02:16:04,251
Um,

4638
02:16:04,251 --> 02:16:04,970
and I,

4639
02:16:04,970 --> 02:16:09,970
I feel really lucky for that because I
have so much information and experience

4640
02:16:11,301 --> 02:16:14,030
and understanding of what
this business entails.

4641
02:16:14,031 --> 02:16:14,540
We've,

4642
02:16:14,540 --> 02:16:15,770
we've booked our own shows,

4643
02:16:15,771 --> 02:16:17,240
we've been around manager at times,

4644
02:16:17,241 --> 02:16:18,740
we've done all the shit,

4645
02:16:19,040 --> 02:16:19,311
you know,

4646
02:16:19,311 --> 02:16:19,610
and if,

4647
02:16:19,610 --> 02:16:23,480
if we had like blown
up when we were young,

4648
02:16:23,870 --> 02:16:25,100
I don't know what would have happened.

4649
02:16:25,101 --> 02:16:27,200
That's a terrifying thought because,

4650
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:28,700
you know,

4651
02:16:28,700 --> 02:16:29,620
we talk about this a lot,

4652
02:16:29,621 --> 02:16:32,700
but essentially like
being good people and,

4653
02:16:32,701 --> 02:16:33,040
and,

4654
02:16:33,040 --> 02:16:36,070
and having a legitimate
reason for doing this,

4655
02:16:36,100 --> 02:16:38,800
not like some mass predatory,

4656
02:16:38,830 --> 02:16:39,151
you know,

4657
02:16:39,151 --> 02:16:39,371
oh,

4658
02:16:39,371 --> 02:16:40,480
I would just want to be the best.

4659
02:16:40,660 --> 02:16:41,800
That's not why we play music.

4660
02:16:41,801 --> 02:16:42,634
And that's stupid.

4661
02:16:43,090 --> 02:16:43,810
And,

4662
02:16:43,810 --> 02:16:44,320
you know,

4663
02:16:44,320 --> 02:16:45,160
narcissistic.

4664
02:16:45,730 --> 02:16:46,563
Um,

4665
02:16:46,760 --> 02:16:49,930
we've had all these crazy experiences and,

4666
02:16:49,931 --> 02:16:51,070
and difficult times and,

4667
02:16:52,260 --> 02:16:52,990
and it was,

4668
02:16:52,990 --> 02:16:55,390
that's what he's done with Matt.

4669
02:16:56,110 --> 02:16:56,820
Does that mean

4670
02:16:56,820 --> 02:16:58,300
keep it

4671
02:17:02,840 --> 02:17:05,440
close to our goal?

4672
02:17:06,670 --> 02:17:08,290
I told you it was the end of the world.

4673
02:17:08,291 --> 02:17:09,124
The fighter jets.

4674
02:17:13,170 --> 02:17:13,931
Do you snore?

4675
02:17:13,931 --> 02:17:14,201
Jail.

4676
02:17:14,201 --> 02:17:14,481
Cow.

4677
02:17:14,481 --> 02:17:15,161
Oh my God.

4678
02:17:15,161 --> 02:17:16,110
I have to wear a mouthpiece.

4679
02:17:16,160 --> 02:17:16,330
Oh,

4680
02:17:16,330 --> 02:17:16,930
do you really?

4681
02:17:16,930 --> 02:17:17,711
What does that even mean?

4682
02:17:17,711 --> 02:17:18,340
What do you mean?

4683
02:17:18,340 --> 02:17:19,870
My neck is not a normal neck.

4684
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:22,050
She's neck teaching the alien.

4685
02:17:22,060 --> 02:17:24,340
And that's supposed to be what?

4686
02:17:24,341 --> 02:17:29,290
A lot of wrestlers and people who do a
lot of like moving their head around too

4687
02:17:29,291 --> 02:17:31,270
many muscles in your neck and your,

4688
02:17:31,271 --> 02:17:32,590
your tongue will fall over.

4689
02:17:32,591 --> 02:17:32,920
You're,

4690
02:17:32,920 --> 02:17:33,270
you're,

4691
02:17:33,270 --> 02:17:34,240
you're air hole.

4692
02:17:34,630 --> 02:17:35,500
Flog that bitch up.

4693
02:17:35,860 --> 02:17:37,090
So I wear a mouthpiece.

4694
02:17:37,710 --> 02:17:38,100
Damn.

4695
02:17:38,100 --> 02:17:41,770
You got to keep my tongue from falling
back into my air hole and keep your lady.

4696
02:17:41,771 --> 02:17:42,340
Yeah.

4697
02:17:42,340 --> 02:17:42,701
Oh yeah.

4698
02:17:42,701 --> 02:17:43,270
We knew what that,

4699
02:17:43,270 --> 02:17:43,421
no,

4700
02:17:43,421 --> 02:17:44,530
I don't want to die either.

4701
02:17:44,880 --> 02:17:45,150
Sure.

4702
02:17:45,150 --> 02:17:45,983
Guys have died.

4703
02:17:46,240 --> 02:17:46,571
I know.

4704
02:17:46,571 --> 02:17:46,990
Okay.

4705
02:17:46,990 --> 02:17:47,321
Valid.

4706
02:17:47,321 --> 02:17:48,154
Yeah.

4707
02:17:48,200 --> 02:17:49,480
So can you sleep a few times?

4708
02:17:49,481 --> 02:17:50,680
Just give up like a bitch.

4709
02:17:52,540 --> 02:17:53,180
I used to,

4710
02:17:53,180 --> 02:17:53,410
uh,

4711
02:17:53,410 --> 02:17:56,320
my sister has sleep apnea
and I used to live with her.

4712
02:17:56,480 --> 02:17:56,631
Oh,

4713
02:17:56,631 --> 02:17:57,464
let's talk about her.

4714
02:17:58,070 --> 02:17:58,903
She's great.

4715
02:17:58,970 --> 02:17:59,301
Hey,

4716
02:17:59,301 --> 02:17:59,871
you know what?

4717
02:17:59,871 --> 02:18:03,800
She's opening a juice shop in
Cleveland and I support that.

4718
02:18:03,830 --> 02:18:04,370
What's it called?

4719
02:18:04,370 --> 02:18:06,830
I love juice shop daily press juice.

4720
02:18:06,860 --> 02:18:07,693
When is it up?

4721
02:18:08,300 --> 02:18:09,920
It's going to be up very soon actually.

4722
02:18:09,921 --> 02:18:10,730
Allegedly.

4723
02:18:10,730 --> 02:18:15,180
Allegedly dreams have
failed in the past two days.

4724
02:18:17,110 --> 02:18:18,480
The shit out of her.

4725
02:18:18,500 --> 02:18:19,480
I'll tweet the show over.

4726
02:18:19,520 --> 02:18:20,180
Let me know.

4727
02:18:20,180 --> 02:18:21,080
Let me know when it's up.

4728
02:18:21,140 --> 02:18:21,731

4729
02:18:21,731 --> 02:18:23,600
I will pre Albin tweet,

4731
02:18:26,960 --> 02:18:27,201
No,

4732
02:18:27,201 --> 02:18:27,980
we were fine.

4733
02:18:27,980 --> 02:18:28,813
Shut up.

4734
02:18:33,050 --> 02:18:34,250
I've only been to Cleveland once.

4735
02:18:34,251 --> 02:18:35,084
I'll go back.

4736
02:18:35,090 --> 02:18:35,331
Hey,

4737
02:18:35,331 --> 02:18:36,260
next time you're there,

4738
02:18:36,620 --> 02:18:37,670
you should meet my family.

4739
02:18:37,700 --> 02:18:38,533
They're really cool.

4740
02:18:40,820 --> 02:18:41,631
If you're in Cleveland,

4741
02:18:41,631 --> 02:18:42,261
we'll be there.

4742
02:18:42,261 --> 02:18:44,960
We'll make it a point to be there
together and we'll have a party.

4743
02:18:44,961 --> 02:18:45,680
Let's do this.

4744
02:18:45,680 --> 02:18:49,670
How about we book a show cause you guys
and me and Cleveland and we'll see if

4745
02:18:49,680 --> 02:18:50,421
Joey can do it too.

4746
02:18:50,421 --> 02:18:51,530
I love that so much.

4747
02:18:51,531 --> 02:18:53,000
I need to not invite my parents,

4748
02:18:53,001 --> 02:18:53,834
Jesus Christ,

4749
02:18:53,840 --> 02:18:54,830
keeping parents at home.

4750
02:18:55,480 --> 02:18:57,170
Where do we get funding to do this?

4751
02:18:58,340 --> 02:18:59,570
Including the state theater.

4752
02:18:59,600 --> 02:19:01,610
Would you guys aim for the stars?

4753
02:19:01,611 --> 02:19:02,830
Would you guys read you?

4754
02:19:02,840 --> 02:19:04,010
What do you think about your set?

4755
02:19:04,011 --> 02:19:04,310
Right?

4756
02:19:04,310 --> 02:19:05,210
What'd you guys do this?

4757
02:19:05,211 --> 02:19:07,780
Would you guys do your set and
then play in the background?

4758
02:19:07,820 --> 02:19:11,210
While Joey's onstage and I'm onstage
just fuck around and play music.

4759
02:19:11,211 --> 02:19:13,130
Louis Shit for that shit.

4760
02:19:14,070 --> 02:19:14,750
Just have fun.

4761
02:19:14,750 --> 02:19:15,583

4762
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:16,370

4763
02:19:16,370 --> 02:19:16,990
it's done.

4764
02:19:16,990 --> 02:19:17,801
You're like jazz,

4765

jazz

4766
02:19:19,730 --> 02:19:20,300
poetry.

4767
02:19:20,300 --> 02:19:22,580
Like the gay guy from
Star Trek make it so.

4768
02:19:23,360 --> 02:19:24,560
Which one is that gray?

4769
02:19:24,561 --> 02:19:25,271
Kington no,

4770

4771
02:19:28,100 --> 02:19:28,933
contemporary.

4772
02:19:28,980 --> 02:19:29,570
No,

4773
02:19:29,570 --> 02:19:30,700
the new one.

4774
02:19:31,040 --> 02:19:31,940
Not even the new new,

4775
02:19:31,941 --> 02:19:32,774
new new ones.

4776

Three hours.

02:19:37,161 --> 02:19:38,210
Cause it feels like a car.

4780
02:19:38,240 --> 02:19:39,073
No,

4781
02:19:39,220 --> 02:19:42,050

4785
02:19:51,500 --> 02:19:52,280
Brian,

4786
02:19:52,280 --> 02:19:55,340
he just asked me if the fucking
guy from star trek is gay.

4787
02:19:55,390 --> 02:19:56,223
Bald Guy.

4788
02:19:56,580 --> 02:19:58,160
Like do you not even pay attention?

4789
02:19:58,980 --> 02:20:00,410
You don't understand your surroundings.

4790
02:20:01,380 --> 02:20:02,240
What's that guy's name?

4791
02:20:03,950 --> 02:20:04,281
Patrick.

4792
02:20:04,281 --> 02:20:04,881
Patrick Stewart.

4793
02:20:04,881 --> 02:20:05,780
He's a beautiful man.

4794
02:20:06,230 --> 02:20:07,750
Him and Gandalf.

4795
02:20:07,790 --> 02:20:08,600
She gets together.

4796
02:20:08,600 --> 02:20:09,260
They probably have.

4797
02:20:09,260 --> 02:20:09,740
I think that,

4798
02:20:09,740 --> 02:20:10,160
yeah,

4799
02:20:10,160 --> 02:20:11,250
I think this picture is about that.

4800
02:20:11,330 --> 02:20:12,110
Good for them.

4801
02:20:12,110 --> 02:20:12,943
God bless them.

4802
02:20:13,370 --> 02:20:14,990
I'm going to give Jennifer Lawrence a hug.

4803
02:20:14,991 --> 02:20:15,824
If you're near her,

4804
02:20:16,410 --> 02:20:17,840
I want you to tell her
it's going to be okay.

4805
02:20:18,440 --> 02:20:19,273
You're beautiful.

4806
02:20:19,310 --> 02:20:20,143
Don't worry about this

4807
02:20:20,560 --> 02:20:21,393
of you're naked.

4808
02:20:21,830 --> 02:20:22,663
You're beautiful.

4809
02:20:23,150 --> 02:20:24,140
Don't worry about it.

4810
02:20:24,410 --> 02:20:26,060
What's happened is Patrick's to a gay,

4811
02:20:26,061 --> 02:20:30,930
the Guardian falsely outs Captain Picard
after he congratulates Ellen page and

4812
02:20:30,940 --> 02:20:31,773
coming out.

4813
02:20:31,880 --> 02:20:32,713
What year is this though?

4814
02:20:32,970 --> 02:20:33,803
Uh,

4815
02:20:34,420 --> 02:20:35,253
yesterday.

4816
02:20:35,770 --> 02:20:36,720
2011.

4817
02:20:36,870 --> 02:20:40,680
13 February 20th not be gay.

4818
02:20:41,110 --> 02:20:41,471
Okay.

4819
02:20:41,471 --> 02:20:42,090
Iris,

4820
02:20:42,090 --> 02:20:42,923
I hope.

4821
02:20:43,040 --> 02:20:43,930
I hope he's happy.

4822
02:20:43,990 --> 02:20:45,160
Who gives a fuck if he's gay?

4823
02:20:45,520 --> 02:20:46,930
Who gives a fuck?

4824
02:20:48,050 --> 02:20:49,850
Can you guys podcasts?

4825
02:20:49,940 --> 02:20:50,620
It is a,

4826
02:20:50,620 --> 02:20:51,111
you know what?

4827
02:20:51,111 --> 02:20:52,400
I'm a gay friendly person.

4828
02:20:52,401 --> 02:20:53,290
I'm also a trans

4829
02:20:53,370 --> 02:20:54,210
friendly person.

4830
02:20:54,240 --> 02:20:54,990
I really am.

4831
02:20:54,990 --> 02:20:58,770
Even though I don't want trans women
beating the fuck out of CIS women.

4832
02:20:58,920 --> 02:21:00,240
I'm a trans friendly person.

4833
02:21:00,241 --> 02:21:01,074
I'm a

4834
02:21:02,250 --> 02:21:02,761
dwarf,

4835
02:21:02,761 --> 02:21:03,630
friendly person,

4836
02:21:03,920 --> 02:21:04,753
little people,

4837
02:21:05,360 --> 02:21:06,193
whatever it is.

4838
02:21:06,320 --> 02:21:07,071
I'm black,

4839
02:21:07,071 --> 02:21:07,461
friendly,

4840
02:21:07,461 --> 02:21:08,720
Filipino friendly,

4841
02:21:08,750 --> 02:21:09,710
Asian friendly,

4842
02:21:09,711 --> 02:21:10,580
white friendly,

4843
02:21:10,880 --> 02:21:11,830
straight male.

4844
02:21:13,260 --> 02:21:14,093
I'm loving it.

4845
02:21:14,360 --> 02:21:15,290
I love everybody.

4846
02:21:15,410 --> 02:21:19,970
I really do a lot of positivity that
they were all locked up in conflict man.

4847
02:21:19,971 --> 02:21:21,620
And I think there could
be a lot less of it.

4848
02:21:21,621 --> 02:21:22,341
And if there was,

4849
02:21:22,341 --> 02:21:25,910
we'd figure a lot more shit out and we
get a lot more shit done and be nicer to

4850
02:21:25,911 --> 02:21:29,120
each other and make the whole
experience just a little bit easier.

4851
02:21:29,121 --> 02:21:29,571
A little more.

4852
02:21:29,571 --> 02:21:30,000
Well,

4853
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:30,833
Lou,

4854
02:21:30,980 --> 02:21:32,120
we're all in this together,

4855
02:21:32,690 --> 02:21:33,920
no matter who the fuck you are.

4856
02:21:34,940 --> 02:21:35,773
Bottom middle.

4857
02:21:37,060 --> 02:21:37,893
Fuck yeah.

4858
02:21:38,140 --> 02:21:40,190
I've been watching a
lot of the teen feels so

4859
02:21:42,730 --> 02:21:45,610
I've been paying attention
to a lot of people are,

4860
02:21:45,611 --> 02:21:46,444
this is over the line.

4861
02:21:46,620 --> 02:21:49,000
There's a process that happens
when I put out a special,

4862
02:21:49,390 --> 02:21:49,870
um,

4863
02:21:49,870 --> 02:21:52,900
and one of the big things that
happens is after specials out,

4864
02:21:52,901 --> 02:21:53,770
I scramble,

4865
02:21:53,980 --> 02:21:56,800
I go in this mad panic state where I
have to come up with a bunch of new

4866
02:21:56,801 --> 02:21:59,080
material and it's good and it's bad.

4867
02:21:59,081 --> 02:22:00,310
I and yeah.

4868
02:22:00,311 --> 02:22:00,900
And it had some,

4869
02:22:00,900 --> 02:22:04,780
I sometimes the house from rough sets
come to see me while I'm right working out

4870
02:22:04,781 --> 02:22:05,380
new shit.

4871
02:22:05,380 --> 02:22:07,270
Come a year later you'll be so happy.

4872
02:22:07,300 --> 02:22:08,140
It'll all work out.

4873
02:22:08,590 --> 02:22:09,740
But um,

4874
02:22:09,790 --> 02:22:11,950
along the lines of like doing all this,

4875
02:22:11,980 --> 02:22:14,740
I started exposing myself to
a bunch of different things.

4876
02:22:14,741 --> 02:22:16,990
I try to expose myself to
as many things as possible.

4877
02:22:17,270 --> 02:22:18,280
It's really scary.

4878
02:22:18,660 --> 02:22:23,660
It's scary to try to come up with new
material and it's scary to tread down new

4879
02:22:23,981 --> 02:22:26,010
paths and not have formulated

4880
02:22:26,010 --> 02:22:28,980
bits so you can call upon the absolutely
know they're going to be effective,

4881
02:22:29,370 --> 02:22:30,690
but that's what life is about.

4882
02:22:32,580 --> 02:22:33,413
But we'll just,

4883
02:22:34,340 --> 02:22:35,040
um,

4884
02:22:35,040 --> 02:22:35,640
just to,

4885
02:22:35,640 --> 02:22:37,710
to be some supportive friends here.

4886
02:22:38,400 --> 02:22:39,630
You're so fucking brilliant.

4887
02:22:39,631 --> 02:22:40,130
Like your,

4888
02:22:40,130 --> 02:22:41,390
your brain capacity.

4889
02:22:41,450 --> 02:22:42,300
She's got gay.

4890
02:22:44,560 --> 02:22:49,470
I thought it was going like two hours
ago and talked about the guy g h e y like

4891
02:22:49,471 --> 02:22:50,041
protein,

4892
02:22:50,041 --> 02:22:50,874
like whey protein,

4893
02:22:54,550 --> 02:22:55,950
Gay Lakeway.

4894
02:22:55,980 --> 02:22:56,341
What's his,

4895
02:22:56,341 --> 02:22:58,350
and it's trying to say
is we believe in you.

4896
02:22:59,170 --> 02:22:59,561
Believe me.

4897
02:22:59,561 --> 02:23:01,740
You guys too so important
that you believe in me.

4898
02:23:01,950 --> 02:23:03,420
It's important that we
believe in each other.

4899
02:23:05,210 --> 02:23:08,610
I believe I can fly my
God space to answer.

4900
02:23:09,000 --> 02:23:09,720
Yeah,

4901
02:23:09,720 --> 02:23:10,141
I'm sorry.

4902
02:23:10,141 --> 02:23:11,160
I'm not good with compliments.

4903
02:23:11,830 --> 02:23:16,560
Tried to shut them off whenever we feel
secure with complimenting you and you

4904
02:23:16,620 --> 02:23:17,453
not accepting them.

4905
02:23:18,570 --> 02:23:20,010
They fucked me in the past.

4906
02:23:20,011 --> 02:23:20,970
I don't trust him anymore.

4907
02:23:21,000 --> 02:23:21,390
No,

4908
02:23:21,390 --> 02:23:22,223
come on.

4909
02:23:22,440 --> 02:23:24,120
Can you guys please staple you afterward?

4910
02:23:24,570 --> 02:23:28,760
I assume that was a part of our package
deal and giving you guys on the podcast.

4911
02:23:28,770 --> 02:23:29,161
You know what?

4912
02:23:29,161 --> 02:23:31,140
I just realized I'm going to
play this acoustic guitar.

4913
02:23:31,141 --> 02:23:32,730
I don't know if it's going
to hit this microphone.

4914
02:23:32,800 --> 02:23:33,270
Hmm.

4915
02:23:33,270 --> 02:23:35,820
Should I do want to leave
two microphones here.

4916
02:23:35,850 --> 02:23:36,690
Are you cool with that?

4917
02:23:37,200 --> 02:23:37,501
Okay.

4918
02:23:37,501 --> 02:23:39,450
I'm going to aim it at the 12th fret.

4919
02:23:40,170 --> 02:23:40,630
What?

4920
02:23:40,630 --> 02:23:41,463
Welding?

4921
02:23:41,550 --> 02:23:42,720
This piece of shit.

4922
02:23:43,650 --> 02:23:44,483
I think it's okay.

4923
02:23:44,550 --> 02:23:46,350
Jammer and no,

4924
02:23:46,351 --> 02:23:46,561
no,

4925
02:23:46,561 --> 02:23:47,340
it's not Jamie.

4926
02:23:47,340 --> 02:23:47,970
Fix it.

4927
02:23:47,970 --> 02:23:48,291
No,

4928
02:23:48,291 --> 02:23:49,080
no gravity.

4929
02:23:49,080 --> 02:23:49,651
It's a fake.

4930
02:23:49,651 --> 02:23:50,190
God dammit.

4931
02:23:50,190 --> 02:23:51,023
Jamie.

4932
02:23:51,380 --> 02:23:52,290
Jamie are so great.

4933
02:23:53,970 --> 02:23:54,803
How's it going?

4934
02:23:57,870 --> 02:23:58,920
This is drunk talk.

4935
02:23:59,680 --> 02:24:00,520
I'm a little tick.

4936
02:24:02,160 --> 02:24:03,610
I'm glad I don't have to drive further.

4937
02:24:04,200 --> 02:24:05,070
We might not make it through.

4938
02:24:05,071 --> 02:24:07,920
This will be fine and we love you.

4939
02:24:08,610 --> 02:24:09,990
Twitter's lighten up layer car.

4940
02:24:10,050 --> 02:24:11,520
God Damn Christmas tree right now.

4941
02:24:11,940 --> 02:24:12,840
They're so happy.

4942
02:24:12,990 --> 02:24:13,741
I can't hear anything.

4943
02:24:13,741 --> 02:24:15,030
I'm interest is authentic.

4944
02:24:15,060 --> 02:24:15,893
People love it.

4945
02:24:16,200 --> 02:24:17,033
Brian loves it.

4946
02:24:17,680 --> 02:24:19,260
I looked down the table.

4947
02:24:19,440 --> 02:24:20,273
He loves it.

4948
02:24:20,880 --> 02:24:22,570
Hard on no,

4949
02:24:23,270 --> 02:24:24,103
someone I met.

4950
02:24:24,360 --> 02:24:25,193
The is hard.

4951
02:24:25,230 --> 02:24:26,430
I mean it's feet were tapping.

4952
02:24:26,490 --> 02:24:28,650
Fuck Ben,

4953
02:24:28,651 --> 02:24:30,180
are you doing headphones?

4954
02:24:30,960 --> 02:24:32,130
I'm doing one in one out.

4955
02:24:32,190 --> 02:24:33,023
Okay.

4956
02:24:33,040 --> 02:24:33,950
Am I do one and two?

4957
02:24:33,951 --> 02:24:34,784
I'm not sure.

4958
02:24:35,200 --> 02:24:37,310
Oh that shut the fuck up and say,

4959
02:24:40,770 --> 02:24:41,603
okay.

4960
02:24:42,990 --> 02:24:43,823
You Ready?

4961
02:24:43,870 --> 02:24:44,703
Are we doing this now?

4962
02:24:44,730 --> 02:24:45,630
This punk kid.

4963
02:24:48,300 --> 02:24:49,133
Okay.

4964
02:25:03,810 --> 02:25:05,020
When you were young.

4965
02:25:05,040 --> 02:25:06,440
I bet you a park.

4966
02:25:11,470 --> 02:25:12,320
I bet you are.

4967
02:25:14,260 --> 02:25:18,420
Cause it takes one to know potty.

4968
02:25:19,810 --> 02:25:20,231
Yeah,

4969
02:25:20,231 --> 02:25:21,064
I'll bet you.

4970
02:25:48,250 --> 02:25:49,870
I bet you made your mom

4971
02:25:54,870 --> 02:25:59,870
sat in the cross ribbon
cutting and Dan is sad.

4972
02:26:00,930 --> 02:26:02,030
She's a good one.

4973
02:26:16,350 --> 02:26:17,183
Ooh.

4974
02:27:16,750 --> 02:27:17,860
Feeling bad.

4975
02:27:19,820 --> 02:27:20,830
Feeling Bay.

4976
02:27:21,420 --> 02:27:24,130
How you do consumer along the line.

4977
02:27:24,131 --> 02:27:26,730
Somebody gave it to you

4978
02:27:31,960 --> 02:27:35,020
no matter how you do a field.

4979
02:27:43,470 --> 02:27:44,730
Oh yeah,

4980
02:27:58,990 --> 02:27:59,823
yeah.

4981
02:28:03,260 --> 02:28:04,520
MMM.

4982
02:28:11,170 --> 02:28:12,010
That was beautiful.

4983
02:28:12,610 --> 02:28:13,443
I don't know

4984
02:28:17,360 --> 02:28:19,300
when these little fantastic,

4985
02:28:19,301 --> 02:28:20,140
you don't need that shit.

4986
02:28:20,141 --> 02:28:21,010
I love that song.

4987
02:28:21,110 --> 02:28:22,010
I love fucking love that

4988
02:28:22,010 --> 02:28:22,400
song.

4989
02:28:22,400 --> 02:28:23,900
I've heard that song a hundred times.

4990
02:28:24,980 --> 02:28:25,610
Easily.

4991
02:28:25,610 --> 02:28:26,810
Easily without a doubt.

4992
02:28:26,811 --> 02:28:27,680
That's why I picked it.

4993
02:28:27,830 --> 02:28:28,140
I,

4994
02:28:28,140 --> 02:28:29,820
that's the song that I just like,

4995
02:28:29,910 --> 02:28:33,740
just like had this like cool fucking fun,

4996
02:28:33,770 --> 02:28:34,940
like riff to it.

4997
02:28:35,270 --> 02:28:35,810
I just,

4998
02:28:35,810 --> 02:28:37,850
I had to hear that song over
and over and over again.

4999
02:28:38,390 --> 02:28:39,350
I played that song.

5000
02:28:39,410 --> 02:28:40,280
I'm not bullshitting.

5001
02:28:40,490 --> 02:28:41,990
I played that song close
to a hundred times.

5002
02:28:42,710 --> 02:28:46,490
If I had to stop and guess I
played at one time at the gym,

5003
02:28:46,850 --> 02:28:51,170
I put it on repeat and I got on the stair
climber and I went to half an hour and

5004
02:28:51,171 --> 02:28:53,060
I listen to your fucking
song for half an hour.

5005
02:28:54,260 --> 02:28:57,500
I was trying to figure out what song to
use for the beginning of the special and

5006
02:28:57,501 --> 02:28:58,790
I had a bunch of your songs,

5007
02:28:58,791 --> 02:29:01,650
your old songs and new songs and uh,

5008
02:29:05,960 --> 02:29:06,501
and uh,

5009
02:29:06,501 --> 02:29:09,560
I listened to that song over and over
again for half an hour is actually the

5010
02:29:09,561 --> 02:29:10,340
elliptical.

5011
02:29:10,340 --> 02:29:12,650
I misspoke on the stair climber me day.

5012
02:29:12,900 --> 02:29:15,890
I remember the joints allegedly,

5013
02:29:15,920 --> 02:29:17,480
I don't think stair climber
is bad for the joints.

5014
02:29:17,481 --> 02:29:18,830
It just gives the joint some work.

5015
02:29:20,360 --> 02:29:22,040
Bitch ass joints cause of work.

5016
02:29:22,760 --> 02:29:23,960
Stop being scared.

5017
02:29:24,110 --> 02:29:26,480
Stop being scared of
all elliptical and shit.

5018
02:29:27,710 --> 02:29:28,543
What else?

5019
02:29:29,180 --> 02:29:30,013
Yes,

5020
02:29:30,080 --> 02:29:33,500
I got electrocuted when that song started.

5021
02:29:33,740 --> 02:29:36,920
I don't know if it's that amp that's
plugged into something and now I'm sorry

5022
02:29:36,921 --> 02:29:37,371
Brian,

5023
02:29:37,371 --> 02:29:41,590
does the gay coming out of your
sweat so badly happens all the time.

5024
02:29:44,090 --> 02:29:45,010
So badly.

5025
02:29:45,030 --> 02:29:45,920
Not so bad.

5026
02:29:46,310 --> 02:29:47,143
Badly.

5027
02:29:48,910 --> 02:29:49,743
I know.

5028
02:29:49,860 --> 02:29:51,260
You feel so bad.

5029
02:29:51,500 --> 02:29:52,333
I'm working on it.

5030
02:29:52,390 --> 02:29:53,223
You know,

5031
02:29:53,240 --> 02:29:54,150
are you a grammar?

5032
02:29:54,630 --> 02:29:55,463
Yeah,

5033
02:29:56,240 --> 02:29:57,860
I actually really care about that stuff.

5034
02:29:58,130 --> 02:29:59,690
In what way do you accidentally,

5035
02:29:59,691 --> 02:30:00,230
right?

5036
02:30:00,230 --> 02:30:05,030
Y O u r when you met y o u apostrophe
and you tweet it and you go,

5037
02:30:05,031 --> 02:30:05,864
fuck,

5038
02:30:06,010 --> 02:30:06,530
oh no,

5039
02:30:06,530 --> 02:30:09,320
I'm that's worth trashing a
tweet and get it back up again.

5040
02:30:09,321 --> 02:30:10,250
I really care about that.

5041
02:30:10,251 --> 02:30:11,084
I'm not kidding.

5042
02:30:11,450 --> 02:30:12,650
Like twos and twos.

5043
02:30:13,040 --> 02:30:13,551
There's there's,

5044
02:30:13,551 --> 02:30:16,400
and there's all I know is
all I care about don't write.

5045
02:30:16,401 --> 02:30:17,510
You are to me.

5046
02:30:19,100 --> 02:30:20,180
Are you lazy?

5047
02:30:20,600 --> 02:30:25,100
You can't like why are you scared
that you don't know which one is y o u

5048
02:30:25,101 --> 02:30:27,560
apostrophe party while you are,

5049
02:30:27,690 --> 02:30:28,560
I don't think he's talking to you,

5050
02:30:28,561 --> 02:30:29,060
Suzanne.

5051
02:30:29,060 --> 02:30:31,490
I think it's kind of
bringing it to a larger,

5052
02:30:32,650 --> 02:30:33,900
very rhetorical question,

5053
02:30:34,950 --> 02:30:35,970
but I'm confused.

5054
02:30:36,630 --> 02:30:37,560
What is the CSO?

5055
02:30:37,580 --> 02:30:38,413
Hi,

5056
02:30:40,110 --> 02:30:41,310
what do you think about Emojis,

5057
02:30:41,311 --> 02:30:42,144
Joe?

5058
02:30:43,300 --> 02:30:44,133
It'll be fine.

5059
02:30:45,800 --> 02:30:46,860
Everybody's going to be fine.

5060
02:30:46,861 --> 02:30:47,900
This is like the Cheshire cat.

5061
02:30:47,930 --> 02:30:49,780
That's a lot of like Allison.

5062
02:30:49,781 --> 02:30:51,320
This is the 1% of Pipe Jack.

5063
02:30:51,410 --> 02:30:52,243
We'd smoke.

5064
02:30:53,480 --> 02:30:55,880
I've told you at 47 smoking
weed for a little while.

5065
02:30:56,900 --> 02:30:57,111
Joe,

5066
02:30:57,111 --> 02:31:00,890
we really want to talk
about DMT or online.

5067
02:31:01,020 --> 02:31:01,853
Okay,

5068
02:31:03,930 --> 02:31:04,763
fair enough.

5069
02:31:07,150 --> 02:31:10,120
Cia High and let them know that
I'm on the same fucking page.

5070
02:31:10,900 --> 02:31:11,231
Listen,

5071
02:31:11,231 --> 02:31:11,651
Bro,

5072
02:31:11,651 --> 02:31:12,760
I'm not an anti American.

5073
02:31:12,761 --> 02:31:13,780
I used to own a Mustang.

5074
02:31:14,240 --> 02:31:14,370
Well,

5075
02:31:14,370 --> 02:31:17,460
I need you people to know
you did not personally.

5076
02:31:18,420 --> 02:31:20,490
Shelby gt 500

5077
02:31:20,490 --> 02:31:21,270
I'll fuck there.

5078
02:31:21,270 --> 02:31:25,350
You had a bunch of
American cars right now.

5079
02:31:25,351 --> 02:31:27,300
I don't have currently any American cars.

5080
02:31:27,330 --> 02:31:27,930
Jesus.

5081
02:31:27,930 --> 02:31:29,010
What are we working with right now?

5082
02:31:29,030 --> 02:31:29,863
But,

5083
02:31:30,060 --> 02:31:32,790
but when we did this video for your song,

5084
02:31:32,820 --> 02:31:33,750
the punk kid song,

5085
02:31:33,751 --> 02:31:34,620
we used your riff.

5086
02:31:34,830 --> 02:31:36,390
I was driving a new shell.

5087
02:31:36,480 --> 02:31:39,140
One of those new dodge challengers.

5088
02:31:39,490 --> 02:31:40,710
Challenger Srt.

5089
02:31:40,711 --> 02:31:41,544
Hell cats.

5090
02:31:41,850 --> 02:31:42,930
How did you know it was the Dutch?

5091
02:31:43,850 --> 02:31:44,671
Because I pay attention.

5092
02:31:44,671 --> 02:31:45,504
God dammit.

5093
02:31:45,920 --> 02:31:47,040
I sent you an email.

5094
02:31:47,160 --> 02:31:49,320
Oh it me.

5095
02:31:49,820 --> 02:31:50,950
It was a tweet or a,

5096
02:31:50,970 --> 02:31:51,990
it was an Instagram.

5097
02:31:52,890 --> 02:31:53,723
I was there.

5098
02:31:55,750 --> 02:31:57,360
This an Instagram on a party.

5099
02:31:57,930 --> 02:31:58,231
Oh,

5100
02:31:58,231 --> 02:31:58,621
I didn't know.

5101
02:31:58,621 --> 02:31:59,490
Ben Wants to be a part.

5102
02:32:02,250 --> 02:32:03,570
We talked about this.

5103
02:32:03,780 --> 02:32:04,730
We've talked about this.

5104
02:32:05,610 --> 02:32:06,443
We've talked about,

5105
02:32:07,530 --> 02:32:09,210
what'd you talk about specifically?

5106
02:32:09,211 --> 02:32:11,580
Do you guys now you've tried to
like Mary chicks that don't fuck

5107
02:32:13,410 --> 02:32:15,000
pretty much danger zone.

5108
02:32:16,810 --> 02:32:17,210
Look,

5109
02:32:17,210 --> 02:32:18,043
do you know what though?

5110
02:32:18,210 --> 02:32:20,190
We got Kenny Loggins up
in this motherfucker.

5111
02:32:23,630 --> 02:32:24,463
Dangers?

5112
02:32:26,500 --> 02:32:27,333
No.

5113
02:32:28,520 --> 02:32:29,410
Oh my God.

5114
02:32:29,700 --> 02:32:31,050
Zero musical talent.

5115
02:32:33,870 --> 02:32:34,703
That's going to help

5116
02:32:36,090 --> 02:32:36,451
friends.

5117
02:32:36,451 --> 02:32:37,770
Just let friends be.

5118
02:32:37,980 --> 02:32:38,850
I Love Ben.

5119
02:32:38,910 --> 02:32:39,660
Okay.

5120
02:32:39,660 --> 02:32:41,310
I don't have anything invested in Ben.

5121
02:32:41,311 --> 02:32:42,510
Not fucking up his words.

5122
02:32:42,660 --> 02:32:42,871
No,

5123
02:32:42,871 --> 02:32:43,021
no,

5124
02:32:43,021 --> 02:32:43,380
no.

5125
02:32:43,380 --> 02:32:44,220
I'm great.

5126
02:32:44,340 --> 02:32:46,970
I'm going to be ultimately
supportive and loving towards you.

5127
02:32:47,330 --> 02:32:51,570
Just cash you the weirdest nonsexual
couple of sexual attention,

5128
02:32:51,571 --> 02:32:51,871
I think.

5129
02:32:51,871 --> 02:32:52,521
I think you guys just need,

5130
02:32:52,521 --> 02:32:53,940
as you might have to one day

5131
02:32:59,230 --> 02:33:00,900
you guys might wind up married.

5132
02:33:01,170 --> 02:33:02,003
Is that possible?

5133
02:33:02,160 --> 02:33:05,490
That's a one day you guys get
super famous in fucking comment.

5134
02:33:05,491 --> 02:33:07,110
Flail away in the weeds.

5135
02:33:09,520 --> 02:33:11,240
Maybe 60 no,

5136
02:33:11,250 --> 02:33:14,210
forties 40 so we still have some action.

5137
02:33:14,760 --> 02:33:16,840
There's a certain number of years you can,

5138
02:33:16,920 --> 02:33:19,050
you can put on your body when no
one wants to fuck you anymore,

5139
02:33:19,530 --> 02:33:23,070
unless you're like a class to
make sure you're cool with it.

5140
02:33:23,970 --> 02:33:25,020
A spin.

5141
02:33:26,070 --> 02:33:27,620
You want to take this
shit to the next level.

5142
02:33:27,630 --> 02:33:28,480
You'll be the old machine.

5143
02:33:29,040 --> 02:33:30,600
Will you fucking married?

5144
02:33:30,630 --> 02:33:30,830
Yeah,

5145
02:33:30,830 --> 02:33:32,010
I married people before

5146
02:33:33,940 --> 02:33:34,140
I'm,

5147
02:33:34,140 --> 02:33:35,370
I'm an ordained minister.

5148
02:33:37,000 --> 02:33:37,833
You're not kidding.

5149
02:33:38,060 --> 02:33:39,340
Like one of those online training,

5150
02:33:39,800 --> 02:33:40,410
ww.

5151
02:33:40,410 --> 02:33:41,243
I'm not kidding.

5152
02:33:41,250 --> 02:33:41,791
I'm not kidding.

5153
02:33:41,791 --> 02:33:43,110
They send me all the time.

5154
02:33:43,290 --> 02:33:43,990
I,

5155
02:33:43,990 --> 02:33:44,670
I'm good.

5156
02:33:44,670 --> 02:33:49,670
I literally did marry a couple
that one fear factor together.

5157
02:33:49,950 --> 02:33:50,200
Oh,

5158
02:33:50,200 --> 02:33:52,800
she carried them in Vegas with the nicer,

5159
02:33:52,801 --> 02:33:53,634
cool.

5160
02:33:54,260 --> 02:33:54,690
Divorced.

5161
02:33:54,690 --> 02:33:55,350
Yeah,

5162
02:33:55,350 --> 02:33:56,310
I hope so.

5163
02:33:56,311 --> 02:33:58,650
I ran into someone a long time ago.

5164
02:33:58,890 --> 02:34:00,530
Them just a little bit dry.

5165
02:34:00,580 --> 02:34:03,810
Just blow it on her homeboy Uber little.

5166
02:34:03,840 --> 02:34:04,673
Oh yeah.

5167
02:34:05,820 --> 02:34:06,241
Don't worry.

5168
02:34:06,241 --> 02:34:06,541
Don't worry.

5169
02:34:06,541 --> 02:34:07,374
We're good.

5170
02:34:10,220 --> 02:34:11,053
Don't,

5171
02:34:11,950 --> 02:34:14,390
no one

5172
02:34:16,930 --> 02:34:18,030
calls to a

5173
02:34:18,150 --> 02:34:18,450
push.

5174
02:34:18,450 --> 02:34:19,090
Hey listen,

5175
02:34:19,090 --> 02:34:20,410
I'm trying to make something happen here.

5176
02:34:20,411 --> 02:34:21,244
Ladies and gentlemen,

5177
02:34:21,520 --> 02:34:25,060
this is my second person I've
convinced into smoking weed this month.

5178
02:34:25,390 --> 02:34:27,370
Number one was Graham Hancock number.

5179
02:34:28,090 --> 02:34:28,960
Graham Hancock,

5180
02:34:30,610 --> 02:34:31,450
a friend of mine,

5181
02:34:31,451 --> 02:34:33,430
his name is BC is going on.

5182
02:34:33,431 --> 02:34:34,540
You have a friend named beasties.

5183
02:34:34,830 --> 02:34:35,740
His name's BC,

5184
02:34:35,920 --> 02:34:36,753
and he's going,

5185
02:34:36,790 --> 02:34:39,870
he's going on one of Graham
Hancock's tours in Egypt.

5186
02:34:39,900 --> 02:34:40,151
Plan.

5187
02:34:40,151 --> 02:34:40,984
He's amazing.

5188
02:34:41,360 --> 02:34:42,550
I love the shit out of that guy.

5189
02:34:42,551 --> 02:34:46,480
And he was on the podcast and he had taken
a three year break from marijuana and

5190
02:34:46,481 --> 02:34:49,360
he was talking about how he missed it
while you realize it was kind of abusing

5191
02:34:49,361 --> 02:34:50,650
it and who's doing it all day.

5192
02:34:50,950 --> 02:34:52,210
And it was used again as a crutch.

5193
02:34:52,390 --> 02:34:56,320
And he did Iowasca and he recognized the
fact that he was using it as a crutch.

5194
02:34:56,321 --> 02:34:58,390
And then on the podcast he was
talking about how he missed it.

5195
02:34:58,960 --> 02:35:00,430
And so he took one,

5196
02:35:00,431 --> 02:35:01,450
maybe two heads,

5197
02:35:01,660 --> 02:35:04,870
and then just opened up like a flower.

5198
02:35:05,350 --> 02:35:06,183
Beautiful.

5199
02:35:07,480 --> 02:35:12,460
You snip is a reason why the table so
flight is going to trust my instincts.

5200
02:35:13,730 --> 02:35:15,250
I love him so much.

5201
02:35:15,860 --> 02:35:17,360
But he started talking about,

5202
02:35:18,210 --> 02:35:21,550
he started talking and like with these
great passion about these ancient

5203
02:35:21,730 --> 02:35:26,590
civilizations that probably existed in
Egypt and the resistance to accepting

5204
02:35:26,591 --> 02:35:27,600
them and he has his office.

5205
02:35:27,860 --> 02:35:29,560
This is fucking beautiful wrap.

5206
02:35:29,561 --> 02:35:30,460
It's like a song.

5207
02:35:30,580 --> 02:35:31,241
It's like a song.

5208
02:35:31,241 --> 02:35:31,460
Lee,

5209
02:35:31,460 --> 02:35:31,750
when he,

5210
02:35:31,750 --> 02:35:33,310
when we really locks into it,

5211
02:35:33,520 --> 02:35:36,760
when he really locks into this discussion
of these ancient civilizations,

5212
02:35:37,000 --> 02:35:41,800
it's such a passion for him that he's
constructed the narrative and like this

5213
02:35:41,801 --> 02:35:45,280
really beautiful melodic sort of like,

5214
02:35:45,310 --> 02:35:45,671
oh,

5215
02:35:45,671 --> 02:35:46,720
like a play.

5216
02:35:47,170 --> 02:35:48,250
So when he tells it to you,

5217
02:35:48,251 --> 02:35:49,300
it's hypnotic.

5218
02:35:49,720 --> 02:35:49,961
You know,

5219
02:35:49,961 --> 02:35:50,111
he's,

5220
02:35:50,111 --> 02:35:51,460
Tom's gone so deep.

5221
02:35:51,910 --> 02:35:52,480
So Dean,

5222
02:35:52,480 --> 02:35:53,260
that's incredible.

5223
02:35:53,260 --> 02:35:57,400
And every year some new shit
comes out that makes him,

5224
02:35:57,610 --> 02:35:58,990
where's that coming from?

5225
02:35:59,830 --> 02:36:00,281
What do you mean?

5226
02:36:00,281 --> 02:36:00,880
Which which?

5227
02:36:00,880 --> 02:36:01,870
Which says new shit.

5228
02:36:01,871 --> 02:36:03,060
Is that archaeology or?

5229
02:36:03,400 --> 02:36:04,233
Yeah.

5230
02:36:04,240 --> 02:36:05,530
Well there's every year.

5231
02:36:05,590 --> 02:36:06,280
Like grandma,

5232
02:36:06,280 --> 02:36:07,090
if you don't know,

5233
02:36:07,090 --> 02:36:08,200
Graham Hancock rang.

5234
02:36:08,890 --> 02:36:13,540
Graham wrote an amazing book called
the fingerprints of the gods and

5235
02:36:13,690 --> 02:36:14,920
fingerprints of the gods are footprints.

5236
02:36:16,660 --> 02:36:17,493
Fingerprints.

5237
02:36:18,600 --> 02:36:19,690
I think it's for me to make sure

5238
02:36:21,350 --> 02:36:22,900
the two feet in the beach and stuff.

5239
02:36:23,030 --> 02:36:23,863
Yeah.

5240
02:36:24,250 --> 02:36:26,320
Footprints of the God's fingerprints.

5241
02:36:28,360 --> 02:36:29,193
Fingerprints on the gun.

5242
02:36:29,250 --> 02:36:29,650
Okay.

5243
02:36:29,650 --> 02:36:30,483
Fingerprints.

5244
02:36:30,610 --> 02:36:31,090
Anyway,

5245
02:36:31,090 --> 02:36:31,780
sorry,

5246
02:36:31,780 --> 02:36:32,410
I forget.

5247
02:36:32,410 --> 02:36:33,610
I've read it and I forget.

5248
02:36:33,790 --> 02:36:34,623
It's just a title.

5249
02:36:34,690 --> 02:36:35,510
It's just a word.

5250
02:36:35,510 --> 02:36:36,820
Just noise you make with your mouth,

5251
02:36:37,450 --> 02:36:42,450
but the idea behind it was that what he
believed is that there are established

5252
02:36:43,270 --> 02:36:48,270
areas of the world where there's
archeology that they can't quite explain.

5253
02:36:48,820 --> 02:36:52,450
Massive stones cut with extreme precision,

5254
02:36:52,600 --> 02:36:54,010
moved into position.

5255
02:36:54,820 --> 02:36:55,580
John Hinges,

5256
02:36:55,580 --> 02:36:56,261
nothing.

5257
02:36:56,261 --> 02:36:58,630
There's a place called
[inaudible] back in Lebanon,

5258
02:36:58,631 --> 02:37:00,310
something greater than Stonehenge.

5259
02:37:00,730 --> 02:37:01,520
Holy Shit,

5260
02:37:01,520 --> 02:37:02,380
dude.

5261
02:37:03,780 --> 02:37:04,840
It's not just one.

5262
02:37:04,841 --> 02:37:05,710
There's a bunch of them.

5263
02:37:06,090 --> 02:37:10,390
It's like the oldest pyramids
have survived much longer
than the newer pyramids.

5264
02:37:10,391 --> 02:37:11,224
There was a certain,

5265
02:37:11,230 --> 02:37:13,420
I don't know about all
that that's in the book,

5266
02:37:14,640 --> 02:37:15,321
but the Pure,

5267
02:37:15,321 --> 02:37:16,160
the pyramid thing

5268
02:37:16,160 --> 02:37:20,750
is really under dispute between people
that are real and Shit Egyptologists and

5269
02:37:20,751 --> 02:37:25,751
people like John Anthony West who's
this brilliant alternative Egyptology

5270
02:37:25,761 --> 02:37:29,250
thinker and Graham Hancock and
a lot of these revisionist guys.

5271
02:37:29,450 --> 02:37:32,630
There's still some debate as to
what's correct and what's not correct,

5272
02:37:33,080 --> 02:37:37,290
but there's been a lot of evidence
that that dates the great pyramid.

5273
02:37:37,291 --> 02:37:42,291
It's like the pyramid of Giza to 2,500
BC and that doesn't jive with this Guy

5274
02:37:45,020 --> 02:37:48,920
Robert Schoch who's a geologist at Boston
University and this Guy John Anthony

5275
02:37:48,920 --> 02:37:52,670
West and Graham Hancock who believed
that there's all sorts of evidence that

5276
02:37:52,671 --> 02:37:56,780
there was massive erosion that probably
came from rainfall and one of them was

5277
02:37:56,781 --> 02:37:57,480
on the inside.

5278
02:37:57,480 --> 02:37:59,420
The enclosure with a Sphinx was built,

5279
02:37:59,690 --> 02:38:00,011
so we,

5280
02:38:00,011 --> 02:38:00,980
the Sphinx was built,

5281
02:38:00,981 --> 02:38:02,390
it was sort of cut out of this,

5282
02:38:02,620 --> 02:38:02,840
you know,

5283
02:38:02,840 --> 02:38:07,840
big stone quarry and the stones that
were cut out where presumably smooth but

5284
02:38:08,031 --> 02:38:12,140
over like thousands and thousands
of years have become like contoured.

5285
02:38:12,350 --> 02:38:17,060
And the debate is whether or not that
contour is because of erosion with sand

5286
02:38:17,061 --> 02:38:19,190
and wind or because of water.

5287
02:38:19,460 --> 02:38:22,880
And there's a bunch of geologists that
have got behind the water and they're

5288
02:38:22,881 --> 02:38:24,340
saying this is water erosion.

5289
02:38:24,360 --> 02:38:25,910
This is consistent with water erosion.

5290
02:38:26,090 --> 02:38:27,530
The number one being the most prominent.

5291
02:38:27,680 --> 02:38:31,700
Robert Schoch who is a
geologist at Boston University,

5292
02:38:31,701 --> 02:38:34,850
he's done a bunch of papers on this
and explained that what we're probably

5293
02:38:34,851 --> 02:38:37,160
looking at is thousands
of years of rainfall.

5294
02:38:37,161 --> 02:38:42,080
That's a of these things which would
predate the construction of this area.

5295
02:38:42,230 --> 02:38:43,063
The cutout,

5296
02:38:43,100 --> 02:38:43,241
the,

5297
02:38:43,241 --> 02:38:43,421
the,

5298
02:38:43,421 --> 02:38:43,581
the,

5299
02:38:43,581 --> 02:38:44,210
the like the,

5300
02:38:44,210 --> 02:38:45,250
the flat wall,

5301
02:38:45,270 --> 02:38:47,750
this area to like 9,000 BC,

5302
02:38:47,900 --> 02:38:51,500
which they don't have any
civilizations that they knew of before,

5303
02:38:51,530 --> 02:38:52,310
like that age.

5304
02:38:52,310 --> 02:38:53,840
If it was me making that kind of shit,

5305
02:38:53,990 --> 02:38:57,290
but then they found some stuff in
Turkey called Gold Beckley Tempe.

5306
02:38:57,291 --> 02:38:59,800
They found this big
structure that's like this.

5307
02:38:59,810 --> 02:39:00,980
They're just in covering it now.

5308
02:39:00,981 --> 02:39:03,110
I think they've only got
like 10% of it uncovered.

5309
02:39:03,290 --> 02:39:04,270
So every innocence,

5310
02:39:04,310 --> 02:39:07,670
14,000 years old between
12 and 14,000 years old.

5311
02:39:07,760 --> 02:39:08,660
So every year,

5312
02:39:08,661 --> 02:39:10,130
like they find more shit.

5313
02:39:10,250 --> 02:39:13,580
That makes Graham Hancock's theories
like look more and more plausible.

5314
02:39:13,760 --> 02:39:17,120
And then he's got together with a bunch
of other people that know about like

5315
02:39:17,420 --> 02:39:20,240
asteroidal impacts this
guy Randall Carlson,

5316
02:39:20,270 --> 02:39:20,750
who's an,

5317
02:39:20,750 --> 02:39:24,520
he's an expert on extinction
events like asteroidal impacts and

5318
02:39:24,920 --> 02:39:25,753
and events.

5319
02:39:26,530 --> 02:39:27,910
Besides the dinosaur thing.

5320
02:39:27,911 --> 02:39:29,280
What has been a fuck load of time?

5321
02:39:29,310 --> 02:39:29,770
Look,

5322
02:39:29,770 --> 02:39:32,290
keep deferring it this been
a fuck load of that talk.

5323
02:39:32,291 --> 02:39:34,210
And they think they happen all the time,

5324
02:39:34,211 --> 02:39:34,421
man.

5325
02:39:34,421 --> 02:39:36,790
They think they have them
like every 12 13,000 years.

5326
02:39:36,791 --> 02:39:37,151
So we'll,

5327
02:39:37,151 --> 02:39:37,481
okay,

5328
02:39:37,481 --> 02:39:38,860
so 12 13,000 years ago,

5329
02:39:38,861 --> 02:39:41,050
what went extinct as a result
of an asteroid exploding?

5330
02:39:42,310 --> 02:39:43,143
I don't even know what I'm saying.

5331
02:39:43,540 --> 02:39:44,860
They believe like this is,

5332
02:39:44,861 --> 02:39:48,760
there's a lot of like guesswork when
it comes to anything that's like 12,000

5333
02:39:48,761 --> 02:39:49,180
years ago.

5334
02:39:49,180 --> 02:39:49,871
There's a lot of like,

5335
02:39:49,871 --> 02:39:50,704
what the hell happened?

5336
02:39:50,800 --> 02:39:51,410
Who knows?

5337
02:39:51,410 --> 02:39:53,860
Like we like to think of 12,000 is like,

5338
02:39:53,980 --> 02:39:54,191
look,

5339
02:39:54,191 --> 02:39:56,230
if you have $12,000 you can't buy a house.

5340
02:39:56,590 --> 02:39:57,423
You know,

5341
02:40:00,470 --> 02:40:02,270
if you borrow a car,

5342
02:40:02,320 --> 02:40:05,800
if you buy a car for $12,000
don't expect to impress anybody,

5343
02:40:05,830 --> 02:40:06,460
right?

5344
02:40:06,460 --> 02:40:06,731
Right.

5345
02:40:06,731 --> 02:40:07,101
If you're,

5346
02:40:07,101 --> 02:40:07,511
you know,

5347
02:40:07,511 --> 02:40:08,980
$12,000 it's not much.

5348
02:40:09,040 --> 02:40:10,510
So 12,000 years,

5349
02:40:11,050 --> 02:40:11,771
Eh,

5350
02:40:11,771 --> 02:40:12,580
what is that?

5351
02:40:12,580 --> 02:40:13,530
It doesn't seem that much,

5352
02:40:13,620 --> 02:40:14,100
but it's

5353
02:40:14,100 --> 02:40:19,100
I'll fucking long time
and 12,000 years ago,

5354
02:40:20,011 --> 02:40:25,011
it's very possible that Earth was
smashed all over the place with these

5355
02:40:25,411 --> 02:40:26,850
asteroidal impacts.

5356
02:40:27,210 --> 02:40:31,590
They keep finding all this stuff like
they found recently found these micro

5357
02:40:31,591 --> 02:40:35,130
diamonds that indicates some sort of
impact and then they found this stuff

5358
02:40:35,131 --> 02:40:36,510
called nuclear glass.

5359
02:40:36,660 --> 02:40:39,210
It's like it's like called Triton
night or something like that.

5360
02:40:39,330 --> 02:40:43,530
And it comes from impacts from these
giant rocks just slamming into the earth

5361
02:40:43,710 --> 02:40:46,440
and it's all all over
like Europe and Asia.

5362
02:40:46,590 --> 02:40:49,440
It's all hot around 12,000 years ago.

5363
02:40:49,800 --> 02:40:53,070
Does that speak to any extinction that
happened or is that the kind of thing

5364
02:40:53,071 --> 02:40:53,370
where like,

5365
02:40:53,370 --> 02:40:53,611
okay,

5366
02:40:53,611 --> 02:40:54,000
these,

5367
02:40:54,000 --> 02:40:59,000
these headed in a different part of
the world so it didn't affect the

5368
02:40:59,041 --> 02:41:02,480
environment like the dinosaur media or,

5369
02:41:02,490 --> 02:41:02,671
well,

5370
02:41:02,671 --> 02:41:04,140
I'm totally talking out of school.

5371
02:41:04,141 --> 02:41:05,310
I don't know what the
fuck I'm talking about.

5372
02:41:05,311 --> 02:41:09,180
I have no scholar lead degrees
on any of the subject convincing.

5373
02:41:09,220 --> 02:41:14,220
But the way it's been explained to me is
there's a great mystery involving what

5374
02:41:14,221 --> 02:41:16,740
happens when you have like,

5375
02:41:16,990 --> 02:41:17,340
uh,

5376
02:41:17,340 --> 02:41:17,791
w w.

5377
02:41:17,791 --> 02:41:20,250
W what happens when you have
like some big extinction event?

5378
02:41:20,280 --> 02:41:22,800
Like where you like have
no saber tooth tigers left.

5379
02:41:22,980 --> 02:41:23,820
You have no wooly tooth.

5380
02:41:23,821 --> 02:41:24,930
Mammas what happened?

5381
02:41:24,960 --> 02:41:29,760
How'd they all die and they've
pinpointed a very specific time and it

5382
02:41:29,761 --> 02:41:31,560
corresponds the same time.

5383
02:41:31,561 --> 02:41:33,810
They're finding this
stuff all over the place.

5384
02:41:34,070 --> 02:41:34,480
This stuff,

5385
02:41:34,480 --> 02:41:35,850
when they do the core samples,

5386
02:41:36,000 --> 02:41:36,630
so some,

5387
02:41:36,630 --> 02:41:37,441
it's very likely,

5388
02:41:37,441 --> 02:41:41,700
it's somewhere around 12,000
years ago we got fucked up.

5389
02:41:42,150 --> 02:41:47,150
Giant rocks from the sky just came down
and fucked everything up and a few few

5390
02:41:47,371 --> 02:41:48,204
people made it,

5391
02:41:48,480 --> 02:41:48,960
you know,

5392
02:41:48,960 --> 02:41:49,920
who knows how many.

5393
02:41:50,310 --> 02:41:51,000
So the,

5394
02:41:51,000 --> 02:41:53,220
the humans were actually present then?

5395
02:41:53,310 --> 02:41:54,143
Most likely.

5396
02:41:54,180 --> 02:41:54,511
Yeah.

5397
02:41:54,511 --> 02:41:56,910
100% 12,000 years ago is gone that long.

5398
02:41:57,360 --> 02:41:58,010
Yeah.

5399
02:41:58,010 --> 02:41:58,440
Weird.

5400
02:41:58,440 --> 02:42:00,150
We probably looked exactly like us.

5401
02:42:00,810 --> 02:42:01,710
Oh totally.

5402
02:42:03,420 --> 02:42:04,260
Tattoos.

5403
02:42:04,930 --> 02:42:05,920
I don't mean like that,

5404
02:42:05,921 --> 02:42:07,300
but I mean like our structure,

5405
02:42:07,570 --> 02:42:08,710
like if you took a dude,

5406
02:42:09,250 --> 02:42:12,670
they probably didn't get as much food
so they would probably like smaller.

5407
02:42:13,000 --> 02:42:14,620
But if you took a brain though,

5408
02:42:14,890 --> 02:42:15,551
very similar,

5409
02:42:15,551 --> 02:42:15,940
right?

5410
02:42:15,940 --> 02:42:17,500
If you could took a person,

5411
02:42:17,770 --> 02:42:18,101
you know,

5412
02:42:18,101 --> 02:42:23,080
regular person from 12,000 years ago and
put them in a movie theater and walk by

5413
02:42:23,081 --> 02:42:24,340
them while you're sitting in your seat.

5414
02:42:24,380 --> 02:42:26,530
You have no idea it
would look like to you.

5415
02:42:27,190 --> 02:42:27,401
I mean,

5416
02:42:27,401 --> 02:42:28,234
it was us,

5417
02:42:28,750 --> 02:42:29,583
Jesus.

5418
02:42:29,620 --> 02:42:32,020
So those people probably
had to start all over.

5419
02:42:32,320 --> 02:42:33,010
But,

5420
02:42:33,010 --> 02:42:34,390
but depending on where this is,

5421
02:42:34,391 --> 02:42:38,510
what I'm just to understand is
depending on where the APP asteroid

5422
02:42:38,870 --> 02:42:40,280
or make me smoke,

5423
02:42:42,020 --> 02:42:42,621
it's gonna go.

5424
02:42:42,621 --> 02:42:43,280
Great.

5425
02:42:43,280 --> 02:42:44,230
This is going to give bed.

5426
02:42:45,120 --> 02:42:46,310
I lost my sparkle.

5427
02:42:48,110 --> 02:42:50,030
What sparkle did you lose?

5428
02:42:51,180 --> 02:42:52,013
One

5429
02:42:53,450 --> 02:42:54,740
please continue what you were saying.

5430
02:42:54,741 --> 02:42:55,574
I'm just gonna.

5431
02:42:55,730 --> 02:42:56,563
I'm just going hit anything.

5432
02:42:56,610 --> 02:42:57,740
Why'd you lose your sparkle?

5433
02:42:58,250 --> 02:42:59,083
I don't know.

5434
02:43:00,320 --> 02:43:00,500
See,

5435
02:43:00,500 --> 02:43:01,370
this is what I'm saying.

5436
02:43:01,820 --> 02:43:03,200
I'm not a good weed smoker.

5437
02:43:03,620 --> 02:43:04,220
You're fine.

5438
02:43:04,220 --> 02:43:05,120
I think you're killing it.

5439
02:43:05,300 --> 02:43:08,900
I think you guys should talk and I
should not put this on the Internet.

5440
02:43:09,860 --> 02:43:10,693
No,

5441
02:43:11,830 --> 02:43:11,980
I

5442
02:43:11,980 --> 02:43:13,090
think it will be awesome.

5443
02:43:14,050 --> 02:43:15,000
Maybe in a second.

5444
02:43:16,500 --> 02:43:19,820
Fingerprints and Gods by
Graham Hancock Gentlemen.

5445
02:43:19,870 --> 02:43:24,130
Fingerprints of the gods that's
available as Amazon taking too much.

5446
02:43:24,390 --> 02:43:24,910
No,

5447
02:43:24,910 --> 02:43:25,541
it's Amazon.

5448
02:43:25,541 --> 02:43:26,291
Super fucked up,

5449
02:43:26,291 --> 02:43:27,124
Joe.

5450
02:43:27,220 --> 02:43:28,053
No,

5451
02:43:28,210 --> 02:43:28,511
no.

5452
02:43:28,511 --> 02:43:28,991
If it did,

5453
02:43:28,991 --> 02:43:31,000
it would they have missiles and tags?

5454
02:43:31,600 --> 02:43:32,950
Definitely not super fucked up.

5455
02:43:33,430 --> 02:43:37,570
I think you're looking at it
like a scale of fucked up.

5456
02:43:37,750 --> 02:43:39,760
Amazon's nowhere near
like super fucked up.

5457
02:43:39,761 --> 02:43:41,290
They're super convenient.

5458
02:43:43,350 --> 02:43:44,310
Right?

5459
02:43:44,920 --> 02:43:49,240
Are they running shit and chasing people
out of the fucking business and like,

5460
02:43:49,270 --> 02:43:51,370
oh no man crushing things.

5461
02:43:51,640 --> 02:43:52,660
Is that what they're doing?

5462
02:43:52,720 --> 02:43:53,250
I don't know.

5463
02:43:53,250 --> 02:43:53,870
I don't know.

5464
02:43:53,870 --> 02:43:56,030
You gotta be a general result.

5465
02:43:56,050 --> 02:43:56,861
amazon.com.

5466
02:43:56,861 --> 02:43:57,280
Yeah.

5467
02:43:57,280 --> 02:43:57,731
Oh man,

5468
02:43:57,731 --> 02:43:59,530
they make life so fucking convenience.

5469
02:43:59,560 --> 02:44:00,460
I put it.

5470
02:44:00,461 --> 02:44:02,080
Is that you're sacrificing anything else?

5471
02:44:02,520 --> 02:44:03,353
Cause I don't know.

5472
02:44:03,400 --> 02:44:04,233
I don't know.

5473
02:44:04,330 --> 02:44:04,661
Depends,

5474
02:44:04,661 --> 02:44:05,301
I mean like the,

5475
02:44:05,301 --> 02:44:06,850
the people that they're sort of,

5476
02:44:06,940 --> 02:44:07,773
um,

5477
02:44:07,990 --> 02:44:08,420
uh,

5478
02:44:08,420 --> 02:44:10,720
affecting or like the
big business like target,

5479
02:44:10,780 --> 02:44:11,151
you know,

5480
02:44:11,151 --> 02:44:11,511
or,

5481
02:44:11,511 --> 02:44:13,180
or whatever.

5482
02:44:13,181 --> 02:44:13,531
Like you,

5483
02:44:13,531 --> 02:44:14,920
you can buy your toilet paper,

5484
02:44:14,921 --> 02:44:15,731
your dish soap,

5485
02:44:15,731 --> 02:44:15,941
your,

5486
02:44:15,941 --> 02:44:18,430
your laundry detergent on Amazon.

5487
02:44:18,431 --> 02:44:19,570
You're both show about two days.

5488
02:44:19,571 --> 02:44:21,460
What about the small Internet vendors?

5489
02:44:21,461 --> 02:44:21,641
You know,

5490
02:44:21,641 --> 02:44:22,860
it's like you're talking
about all these other,

5491
02:44:22,861 --> 02:44:24,160
it's not that tailored.

5492
02:44:24,161 --> 02:44:24,821
Like it doesn't,

5493
02:44:24,821 --> 02:44:25,900
it doesn't have like,

5494
02:44:26,050 --> 02:44:26,883
if you want.

5495
02:44:26,900 --> 02:44:28,930
So sometimes there's like intricate,

5496
02:44:29,280 --> 02:44:29,890
um,

5497
02:44:29,890 --> 02:44:30,311
I don't know,

5498
02:44:30,311 --> 02:44:32,290
fucking vitamin supplements or whatever.

5499
02:44:32,680 --> 02:44:35,170
But for the most part it's the,

5500
02:44:35,450 --> 02:44:36,283
are you okay?

5501
02:44:36,380 --> 02:44:36,591
Yo,

5502
02:44:36,591 --> 02:44:37,424
I'm good.

5503
02:44:39,140 --> 02:44:39,321
No,

5504
02:44:39,321 --> 02:44:39,471
no,

5505
02:44:39,471 --> 02:44:39,701
no.

5506
02:44:39,701 --> 02:44:42,920
I'd be massaging my fucking control.

5507
02:44:44,090 --> 02:44:45,970
But this is kind of the
tip of Tony Nipples.

5508
02:44:46,430 --> 02:44:46,880
Whoa.

5509
02:44:46,880 --> 02:44:47,870
I don't know if,

5510
02:44:47,990 --> 02:44:49,100
I don't know if Amazon,

5511
02:44:49,340 --> 02:44:49,611
honey,

5512
02:44:49,611 --> 02:44:49,851
honey,

5513
02:44:49,851 --> 02:44:50,684
hi.

5514
02:44:51,260 --> 02:44:52,400
You don't know what's going to happen.

5515
02:44:52,430 --> 02:44:53,450
We're fine.

5516
02:44:53,510 --> 02:44:55,030
We're almost home.

5517
02:44:56,870 --> 02:44:58,010
We're amongst friends.

5518
02:44:58,150 --> 02:44:59,270
You've got Jesus Christ.

5519
02:44:59,890 --> 02:45:00,231
I don't know,

5520
02:45:00,231 --> 02:45:02,120
maybe it was too much of a question.

5521
02:45:02,210 --> 02:45:02,450
Wait,

5522
02:45:02,450 --> 02:45:03,530
can I go back to Amazon?

5523
02:45:03,680 --> 02:45:04,513
Fuck yeah,

5524
02:45:04,760 --> 02:45:06,110
I think Amazon is amazing.

5525
02:45:06,390 --> 02:45:09,290
So it kind of takes a little,

5526
02:45:09,760 --> 02:45:10,593
you know,

5527
02:45:10,670 --> 02:45:13,040
dig at the big business for,

5528
02:45:13,110 --> 02:45:15,290
for convenience purposes.

5529
02:45:15,291 --> 02:45:16,011
If you have prime,

5530
02:45:16,011 --> 02:45:16,221
you know,

5531
02:45:16,221 --> 02:45:17,750
you can get all the shit in two days,

5532
02:45:17,990 --> 02:45:18,531
but it's not,

5533
02:45:18,531 --> 02:45:20,000
it's not like you can get,

5534
02:45:20,050 --> 02:45:20,883
um,

5535
02:45:21,280 --> 02:45:24,830
like an intricate tailored item
that you need for the most part.

5536
02:45:25,420 --> 02:45:26,180
Sure.

5537
02:45:26,180 --> 02:45:27,070
I guess that makes sense.

5538
02:45:27,100 --> 02:45:30,940
I don't necessarily think it
cuts out business as much.

5539
02:45:31,330 --> 02:45:32,500
It's not comparable.

5540
02:45:32,950 --> 02:45:35,740
They're very efficient and
it's convenient for people,

5541
02:45:36,880 --> 02:45:38,740
but they kind of have a monopoly on the,

5542
02:45:38,741 --> 02:45:38,981
like,

5543
02:45:38,981 --> 02:45:41,340
we're going to ship shit for you today.

5544
02:45:41,630 --> 02:45:41,980
Well,

5545
02:45:41,980 --> 02:45:43,300
do they have a monopoly?

5546
02:45:44,100 --> 02:45:45,580
I don't think they do.

5547
02:45:45,581 --> 02:45:49,540
I think a lot of people
sell things on the Internet.

5548
02:45:49,570 --> 02:45:54,430
Here's what I was just really good at
figuring out that you know you can make it

5549
02:45:54,431 --> 02:45:55,570
super convenient.

5550
02:45:55,571 --> 02:45:56,351
You one click.

5551
02:45:56,351 --> 02:45:59,020
I mean they're one of the few
companies that started that.

5552
02:45:59,080 --> 02:45:59,231
Right.

5553
02:45:59,231 --> 02:46:00,610
Here's why I think it's
the monopoly though.

5554
02:46:00,760 --> 02:46:01,600
And this is just for me.

5555
02:46:01,690 --> 02:46:04,120
Can you think of one other
company that does the same thing?

5556
02:46:04,810 --> 02:46:05,830
You're on Amazon.

5557
02:46:06,170 --> 02:46:07,300
You sell your shit on them.

5558
02:46:14,960 --> 02:46:17,000
They just dropped the price.

5559
02:46:19,980 --> 02:46:20,813
Great service

5560
02:46:22,550 --> 02:46:23,383
I think

5561
02:46:25,260 --> 02:46:25,790
to them.

5562
02:46:25,790 --> 02:46:26,623
I love Amazon.

5563
02:46:26,770 --> 02:46:28,910
I get like if I get drunk at night,

5564
02:46:28,911 --> 02:46:31,080
like just kidding.

5565
02:46:31,370 --> 02:46:33,310
I will just order shoots to Amazon.

5566
02:46:33,940 --> 02:46:34,773
Sure.

5567
02:46:35,260 --> 02:46:35,951
What are you asking?

5568
02:46:35,951 --> 02:46:36,784
Do you have a question?

5569
02:46:37,080 --> 02:46:37,320
No,

5570
02:46:37,320 --> 02:46:37,751
I do.

5571
02:46:37,751 --> 02:46:38,171
I did.

5572
02:46:38,171 --> 02:46:39,810
I already asked it anyway.

5573
02:46:41,200 --> 02:46:42,033
Oh Man.

5574
02:46:42,310 --> 02:46:43,300
It's nothing wrong with it.

5575
02:46:43,301 --> 02:46:44,320
They're just the best at it.

5576
02:46:45,310 --> 02:46:46,630
They're great order.

5577
02:46:46,690 --> 02:46:49,150
They send your shit if you can't keep up.

5578
02:46:50,350 --> 02:46:52,900
Now there's Alibaba so
that might change shit.

5579
02:46:53,170 --> 02:46:53,920
What's that?

5580
02:46:53,920 --> 02:46:56,110
Alibaba is like the Amazon.

5581
02:46:58,910 --> 02:47:00,470
How do I not know something that you know?

5582
02:47:00,920 --> 02:47:02,320
I've heard about Ali Baba

5583
02:47:02,430 --> 02:47:03,370
cause I was passing.

5584
02:47:03,520 --> 02:47:05,680
This is how much I think
life is a simulation.

5585
02:47:05,940 --> 02:47:09,310
I was passing by this newspaper Rack
and there's this dude and I was like,

5586
02:47:09,311 --> 02:47:09,971
Alibaba,

5587
02:47:09,971 --> 02:47:11,710
now worth more than Google.

5588
02:47:11,711 --> 02:47:12,461
Facebook.

5589
02:47:12,461 --> 02:47:14,410
They just publicly traded
company in the world.

5590
02:47:16,120 --> 02:47:18,370
And I was walking by,

5591
02:47:18,550 --> 02:47:18,881
I was like,

5592
02:47:18,881 --> 02:47:20,050
what the fuck am I doing?

5593
02:47:20,051 --> 02:47:20,884
Like what am I,

5594
02:47:20,890 --> 02:47:21,723
what is this?

5595
02:47:21,880 --> 02:47:24,280
Am I looking at what the fuck is Alibaba?

5596
02:47:24,500 --> 02:47:25,420
It's like an uh,

5597
02:47:26,440 --> 02:47:29,390
maybe not Townsend's side project.

5598
02:47:29,391 --> 02:47:30,224
Fuck,

5599
02:47:31,010 --> 02:47:31,910
what is Alibaba?

5600
02:47:32,900 --> 02:47:34,040
As far as I understand it,

5601
02:47:34,230 --> 02:47:35,063
it's a movie.

5602
02:47:37,360 --> 02:47:38,780
Do you know Alibaba?

5603
02:47:38,800 --> 02:47:39,300
It's like,

5604
02:47:39,300 --> 02:47:39,800
sorry,

5605
02:47:39,800 --> 02:47:41,330
that startup that made like,

5606
02:47:41,540 --> 02:47:44,180
it's like an Asian equivalent of Amazon,

5607
02:47:44,420 --> 02:47:44,930
you know,

5608
02:47:44,930 --> 02:47:48,750
they facilitate businesses
trading with consumer anyway.

5609
02:47:48,751 --> 02:47:49,001
It is.

5610
02:47:49,001 --> 02:47:50,870
So it's like a Amazon for China.

5611
02:47:51,150 --> 02:47:51,983
What you do is you,

5612
02:47:52,110 --> 02:47:55,460
it's like you're hiring
companies to do things for you.

5613
02:47:55,461 --> 02:48:00,461
So like if you want like a thousand
like wallets with your face on it,

5614
02:48:00,771 --> 02:48:02,110
you can con con

5615
02:48:03,880 --> 02:48:05,300
it's a manufacturer.

5616
02:48:05,350 --> 02:48:05,500
No,

5617
02:48:05,500 --> 02:48:05,730
no,

5618
02:48:05,730 --> 02:48:05,861
they,

5619
02:48:05,861 --> 02:48:06,090
they,

5620
02:48:06,090 --> 02:48:10,370
they just the second directory
of manufacturers or like
a distribution network.

5621
02:48:11,710 --> 02:48:12,460
Yeah.

5622
02:48:12,460 --> 02:48:13,730
And it's basically,

5623
02:48:13,790 --> 02:48:15,110
it's similar to Amazon,

5624
02:48:15,111 --> 02:48:18,060
but it's just gotten so big and
because China's such a huge market,

5625
02:48:18,120 --> 02:48:22,550
it just went global and it's at least
at the time that it was going out,

5626
02:48:22,580 --> 02:48:24,290
the biggest globally traded co,

5627
02:48:24,291 --> 02:48:26,570
it was going to be on
the precipice of that.

5628
02:48:27,940 --> 02:48:28,773
Wow.

5629
02:48:29,470 --> 02:48:32,070
When you think about the
numbers of people to go with it,

5630
02:48:32,080 --> 02:48:33,370
the Asian market is like,

5631
02:48:33,730 --> 02:48:35,290
think about how many people were in China.

5632
02:48:35,291 --> 02:48:36,910
It's like a billion plus,

5633
02:48:36,911 --> 02:48:37,240
right?

5634
02:48:37,240 --> 02:48:38,290
1.6 billion.

5635
02:48:38,291 --> 02:48:39,041
Something like God is,

5636
02:48:39,041 --> 02:48:39,874
it's that high.

5637
02:48:41,190 --> 02:48:42,023
Is that real?

5638
02:48:42,420 --> 02:48:44,660
Would probably more than
probably more than that.

5639
02:48:45,220 --> 02:48:49,090
So like close to a million,

5640
02:48:49,091 --> 02:48:50,890
like say to hunt,

5641
02:48:51,130 --> 02:48:53,770
like one point a billion,

5642
02:48:53,771 --> 02:48:55,030
2 million,

5643
02:48:55,110 --> 02:48:57,420
a thousand million plus
another 600 million.

5644
02:48:57,600 --> 02:48:57,931
She say,

5645
02:48:57,931 --> 02:48:58,201
sorry,

5646
02:48:58,201 --> 02:48:58,441
sorry.

5647
02:48:58,441 --> 02:49:01,800
600,000 men to book more than what we are.

5648
02:49:02,730 --> 02:49:03,563
Yeah.

5649
02:49:04,350 --> 02:49:05,183
That's insane.

5650
02:49:05,560 --> 02:49:06,930
We're a 350 million.

5651
02:49:07,170 --> 02:49:08,003
Yeah.

5652
02:49:08,310 --> 02:49:09,210
Oh my God.

5653
02:49:09,300 --> 02:49:10,840
Just think about how many goddamn people

5654
02:49:12,350 --> 02:49:13,530
know what's bad.

5655
02:49:13,620 --> 02:49:14,453
You're fine,

5656
02:49:15,010 --> 02:49:16,310
Jamie.

5657
02:49:18,490 --> 02:49:19,350
I love being a dick.

5658
02:49:19,450 --> 02:49:19,981
No,

5659
02:49:19,981 --> 02:49:20,814
she's fine.

5660
02:49:21,130 --> 02:49:22,080
Both everybody's good.

5661
02:49:22,320 --> 02:49:23,430
Just think about the numbers.

5662
02:49:23,590 --> 02:49:25,110
Think about how many Chinese folks are,

5663
02:49:25,111 --> 02:49:25,680
are,

5664
02:49:25,680 --> 02:49:27,960
and then add that to Asian folks.

5665
02:49:28,080 --> 02:49:29,040
That's another billion.

5666
02:49:29,930 --> 02:49:30,140
Yeah,

5667
02:49:30,140 --> 02:49:30,973
sure.

5668
02:49:31,060 --> 02:49:31,890
Thanks.

5669
02:49:31,890 --> 02:49:32,521
Think about that.

5670
02:49:32,521 --> 02:49:33,354
Asian folks,

5671
02:49:34,560 --> 02:49:36,330
Asian folks like China,

5672
02:49:37,200 --> 02:49:38,033
India,

5673
02:49:38,100 --> 02:49:39,570
India is another billion.

5674
02:49:39,630 --> 02:49:41,550
Right close to it.

5675
02:49:42,040 --> 02:49:42,700
Yeah,

5676
02:49:42,700 --> 02:49:43,320
Dude.

5677
02:49:43,320 --> 02:49:44,010
Japan,

5678
02:49:44,010 --> 02:49:44,843
Indonesia.

5679
02:49:49,080 --> 02:49:49,861
It's amazing though.

5680
02:49:49,861 --> 02:49:50,400
It's really,

5681
02:49:50,400 --> 02:49:50,691
man.

5682
02:49:50,691 --> 02:49:51,524
It's exciting.

5683
02:49:51,690 --> 02:49:52,290
Have you been,

5684
02:49:52,290 --> 02:49:53,640
when was the last time you were in Japan?

5685
02:49:54,030 --> 02:49:55,680
We are a swarm.

5686
02:49:58,620 --> 02:49:59,453
We're a

5687
02:50:00,890 --> 02:50:02,070
swarm on this planet.

5688
02:50:02,130 --> 02:50:03,030
You don't swarm.

5689
02:50:03,031 --> 02:50:03,330
There's,

5690
02:50:03,330 --> 02:50:04,650
there's billions of us.

5691
02:50:04,890 --> 02:50:06,320
You were like this when you did it.

5692
02:50:06,740 --> 02:50:08,250
I was trying to be like wonder woman.

5693
02:50:08,280 --> 02:50:09,260
I'll try and real was,

5694
02:50:10,140 --> 02:50:11,090
I was thinking strong.

5695
02:50:11,150 --> 02:50:11,983
Linda Carter.

5696
02:50:15,780 --> 02:50:18,270
We're a swarm with us a lot,

5697
02:50:20,730 --> 02:50:23,580
so as the low hanging fruit,

5698
02:50:23,640 --> 02:50:24,570
I mean that was obvious.

5699
02:50:24,690 --> 02:50:27,610
There was a fucking lot of us people,

5700
02:50:27,850 --> 02:50:28,620
you know,

5701
02:50:28,620 --> 02:50:30,480
I mean there's still plenty of space.

5702
02:50:30,481 --> 02:50:33,180
Don't get is why some of us,

5703
02:50:33,181 --> 02:50:33,770
that's good.

5704
02:50:33,770 --> 02:50:35,760
The good friends she band together

5705
02:50:37,450 --> 02:50:38,720
called cult are ready.

5706
02:50:39,700 --> 02:50:40,381
It starts out,

5707
02:50:40,381 --> 02:50:43,180
you call a common and your chickens
and your hunting excursion.

5708
02:50:43,181 --> 02:50:44,430
The police call it a cult.

5709
02:50:46,050 --> 02:50:46,561
Chickens.

5710
02:50:46,561 --> 02:50:48,160
This is no this chicken conversation.

5711
02:50:48,790 --> 02:50:49,623
Chickens are great.

5712
02:50:50,880 --> 02:50:54,240
I think that would be like one of the
best things you could do other than plant

5713
02:50:54,241 --> 02:50:54,841
vegetables.

5714
02:50:54,841 --> 02:50:55,860
Plant vegetables.

5715
02:50:55,890 --> 02:50:57,030
Equally satisfying.

5716
02:50:57,060 --> 02:50:58,380
It's a beautiful vegetable.

5717
02:50:58,440 --> 02:50:59,273
Yeah,

5718
02:50:59,790 --> 02:51:03,690
it's cool to be able to pick
vegetables out of the ground.

5719
02:51:03,930 --> 02:51:04,201
I mean,

5720
02:51:04,201 --> 02:51:05,250
I don't do enough of it.

5721
02:51:05,251 --> 02:51:07,110
I would like to do all of my vegetables,

5722
02:51:07,111 --> 02:51:08,760
like planted garden vegetables.

5723
02:51:08,761 --> 02:51:10,830
I just think that'd be like
the coolest thing to be,

5724
02:51:11,070 --> 02:51:15,060
have like a complete direct
relationship with all the food you eat.

5725
02:51:15,480 --> 02:51:15,870
You know?

5726
02:51:15,870 --> 02:51:16,703
That would be amazing.

5727
02:51:17,310 --> 02:51:17,700
What,

5728
02:51:17,700 --> 02:51:18,960
what are the missing?

5729
02:51:18,961 --> 02:51:19,794
That right.

5730
02:51:19,870 --> 02:51:21,990
We'll give you eat a chicken
or you like thank you.

5731
02:51:25,100 --> 02:51:27,060
Don't have that kind of
relationship with chicken.

5732
02:51:27,910 --> 02:51:29,670
I don't pretend the dietary needs.

5733
02:51:29,970 --> 02:51:30,803
No,

5734
02:51:31,260 --> 02:51:32,340
I just go lizard.

5735
02:51:32,910 --> 02:51:33,600
You eat lizards?

5736
02:51:33,600 --> 02:51:33,881
No,

5737
02:51:33,881 --> 02:51:34,740
I just go lizard,

5738
02:51:34,800 --> 02:51:35,191
lizard,

5739
02:51:35,191 --> 02:51:36,590
part of the brain shrimping.

5740
02:51:36,660 --> 02:51:38,430
Just mentally.

5741
02:51:38,460 --> 02:51:38,701
No.

5742
02:51:38,701 --> 02:51:39,780
If you're going to kill a chicken,

5743
02:51:39,781 --> 02:51:40,320
you just,

5744
02:51:40,320 --> 02:51:41,153
you go lizard,

5745
02:51:41,860 --> 02:51:42,061
you know?

5746
02:51:42,061 --> 02:51:43,440
Can't have a lot of compassion.

5747
02:51:44,330 --> 02:51:46,330
So yeah.

5748
02:51:46,950 --> 02:51:47,783
Honestly,

5749
02:51:47,820 --> 02:51:50,700
as far as like the spirit
animal connections go,

5750
02:51:51,060 --> 02:51:52,800
chickens don't feel connected to them.

5751
02:51:52,801 --> 02:51:53,634
Cows,

5752
02:51:53,970 --> 02:51:54,803
pigs,

5753
02:51:55,330 --> 02:51:55,900
goats.

5754
02:51:55,900 --> 02:51:57,420
It's a different thing with mammals.

5755
02:52:00,120 --> 02:52:00,953
You know,

5756
02:52:01,050 --> 02:52:02,100
chickens are weird.

5757
02:52:02,190 --> 02:52:04,410
They're dinosaurs are a strange bird.

5758
02:52:04,411 --> 02:52:05,980
That probably doesn't

5759
02:52:05,980 --> 02:52:06,813
make sense.

5760
02:52:07,560 --> 02:52:09,220
You don't fucking fly.

5761
02:52:09,310 --> 02:52:11,920
We're keeping them around where
the reason they're around.

5762
02:52:12,400 --> 02:52:13,233
Yeah.

5763
02:52:14,740 --> 02:52:15,820
Why are you putting the picture?

5764
02:52:16,660 --> 02:52:16,841
Look,

5765
02:52:16,841 --> 02:52:17,680
you're looking at the time.

5766
02:52:17,980 --> 02:52:18,813
Why are you doing that?

5767
02:52:18,820 --> 02:52:19,830
So if you wanted it to play anymore,

5768
02:52:19,870 --> 02:52:20,010
uh,

5769
02:52:20,010 --> 02:52:20,843
another song,

5770
02:52:21,550 --> 02:52:22,383
another song.

5771
02:52:23,450 --> 02:52:24,283
Brian,

5772
02:52:25,900 --> 02:52:27,070
we're talking about chickens.

5773
02:52:27,160 --> 02:52:27,520
Yeah,

5774
02:52:27,520 --> 02:52:29,440
we're just having fun and their souls

5775
02:52:31,520 --> 02:52:32,680
happens after we laid it,

5776
02:52:32,690 --> 02:52:36,580
but joint chickens and cows and goats,

5777
02:52:37,140 --> 02:52:37,820
there's set.

5778
02:52:37,820 --> 02:52:40,630
There's so many differences and
their spiritual connectivity.

5779
02:52:41,830 --> 02:52:42,663
You got it.

5780
02:52:43,600 --> 02:52:44,790
You painted the picture.

5781
02:52:44,800 --> 02:52:46,750
Dared me to smoke the gunge.

5782
02:52:48,840 --> 02:52:49,673
Susie,

5783
02:52:51,130 --> 02:52:51,821
this is bad,

5784
02:52:51,821 --> 02:52:52,470
isn't it?

5785
02:52:52,470 --> 02:52:52,610
No,

5786
02:52:52,610 --> 02:52:53,240
it's no,

5787
02:52:53,240 --> 02:52:53,771
it's fine.

5788
02:52:53,771 --> 02:52:55,510
We're talking about virtual farms.

5789
02:52:57,360 --> 02:52:58,840
Every question.

5790
02:52:59,620 --> 02:53:00,453
Ben,

5791
02:53:00,460 --> 02:53:01,600
please put your hand up.

5792
02:53:01,601 --> 02:53:02,980
You guys are in class today.

5793
02:53:03,000 --> 02:53:04,480
Thank you for [inaudible] your hair.

5794
02:53:05,940 --> 02:53:07,270
This is like Lord of the flies in here.

5795
02:53:07,271 --> 02:53:07,511
Dude.

5796
02:53:07,511 --> 02:53:08,470
Someone's got to pass the ball.

5797
02:53:09,550 --> 02:53:10,950
I mean Florida fives

5798
02:53:12,480 --> 02:53:13,970
violence is sorry.

5799
02:53:16,600 --> 02:53:18,410
Eventually it is about,

5800
02:53:18,930 --> 02:53:20,290
that's that story.

5801
02:53:20,291 --> 02:53:22,040
We were making our own dark,

5802
02:53:22,750 --> 02:53:24,010
getting darker flies.

5803
02:53:24,280 --> 02:53:25,120
It's still my question.

5804
02:53:25,121 --> 02:53:26,470
I'm sorry Lord of the rings reference.

5805
02:53:26,471 --> 02:53:27,430
I would have been more excited.

5806
02:53:27,700 --> 02:53:28,870
You had to go with flies.

5807
02:53:29,130 --> 02:53:29,860
Sorry.

5808
02:53:29,860 --> 02:53:30,690
Okay.

5809
02:53:30,690 --> 02:53:31,523
Okay.

5810
02:53:31,890 --> 02:53:32,980
I see vegetables.

5811
02:53:33,490 --> 02:53:33,701
What?

5812
02:53:33,701 --> 02:53:34,570
You're growing new garden.

5813
02:53:34,571 --> 02:53:36,130
Is it native to here?

5814
02:53:36,910 --> 02:53:37,450
Ooh,

5815
02:53:37,450 --> 02:53:38,410
good question.

5816
02:53:38,560 --> 02:53:39,400
Very good question.

5817
02:53:40,400 --> 02:53:40,631
Yeah,

5818
02:53:40,631 --> 02:53:41,500
that's a good question.

5819
02:53:43,350 --> 02:53:43,750
Why?

5820
02:53:43,750 --> 02:53:44,580
Like what?

5821
02:53:44,580 --> 02:53:45,320
Okay.

5822
02:53:45,320 --> 02:53:46,240
Like what is,

5823
02:53:46,241 --> 02:53:47,650
if you're going to grow lettuce,

5824
02:53:48,490 --> 02:53:49,323
lettuce,

5825
02:53:49,540 --> 02:53:50,220
speak.

5826
02:53:50,220 --> 02:53:51,070
What's lettuce like?

5827
02:53:51,100 --> 02:53:52,780
Regular Romaine lettuce.

5828
02:53:53,170 --> 02:53:54,160
What's that native sue.

5829
02:53:54,250 --> 02:53:55,071
I have no idea.

5830
02:53:55,071 --> 02:53:55,810
It's America.

5831
02:53:55,810 --> 02:53:56,643
Romania.

5832
02:53:56,740 --> 02:53:57,860
We grow in in Ohio.

5833
02:53:58,520 --> 02:53:58,790
Right,

5834
02:53:58,790 --> 02:54:01,500
but I mean it's just a
regular North American plants.

5835
02:54:01,750 --> 02:54:04,720
I don't think that you don't have
the weather doesn't have to be,

5836
02:54:05,680 --> 02:54:06,220
you know,

5837
02:54:06,220 --> 02:54:07,053
it could just be,

5838
02:54:07,180 --> 02:54:08,560
you just need to have sunlight guys.

5839
02:54:08,561 --> 02:54:09,250
We got Google.

5840
02:54:09,250 --> 02:54:10,083
There's some

5841
02:54:12,100 --> 02:54:14,260
props that need more sunlight.

5842
02:54:14,580 --> 02:54:16,780
[inaudible]

5843
02:54:17,040 --> 02:54:19,470
standing there like this guys.

5844
02:54:19,471 --> 02:54:20,150
We got guys,

5845
02:54:20,150 --> 02:54:20,983
we got

5846
02:54:22,900 --> 02:54:23,733
to that brand.

5847
02:54:23,840 --> 02:54:24,673
That's a meme,

5848
02:54:25,530 --> 02:54:26,363
bro.

5849
02:54:29,150 --> 02:54:29,983
Fuck,

5850
02:54:31,770 --> 02:54:33,550
fuck your meme.

5851
02:54:33,551 --> 02:54:34,480
The fuck on here.

5852
02:54:34,481 --> 02:54:35,314
Some.

5853
02:54:35,630 --> 02:54:37,870
It's very important you get me because
they're saying that it's not going to

5854
02:54:37,871 --> 02:54:38,704
happen.

5855
02:54:38,830 --> 02:54:39,490
That's how it works.

5856
02:54:39,490 --> 02:54:40,480
That's not how it works.

5857
02:54:41,290 --> 02:54:42,081
I don't know how it works.

5858
02:54:42,081 --> 02:54:42,491
There's no,

5859
02:54:42,491 --> 02:54:43,450
no one knows how it works.

5860
02:54:43,600 --> 02:54:44,870
We don't know it.

5861
02:54:45,000 --> 02:54:46,110
It worked better.

5862
02:54:46,120 --> 02:54:46,953
My skin tone.

5863
02:54:48,630 --> 02:54:50,230
I think we should play the song.

5864
02:54:51,440 --> 02:54:53,500
You know which one do you want it?

5865
02:54:53,530 --> 02:54:54,280
Well Joe,

5866
02:54:54,280 --> 02:54:55,770
please do you want us to play song?

5867
02:54:57,150 --> 02:54:57,983
What do you guys want to play?

5868
02:54:58,540 --> 02:55:02,290
We were trying to figure
that out or like non ballad.

5869
02:55:03,020 --> 02:55:05,030
I want whatever you guys want to play.

5870
02:55:05,780 --> 02:55:06,330
Okay.

5871
02:55:06,330 --> 02:55:06,720
Fuck it.

5872
02:55:06,720 --> 02:55:07,670
He fucked you want a paper?

5873
02:55:07,671 --> 02:55:07,881
Rock.

5874
02:55:07,881 --> 02:55:08,320
Scissors.

5875
02:55:08,320 --> 02:55:08,920
And for what?

5876
02:55:08,920 --> 02:55:09,770
What's the choices?

5877
02:55:11,000 --> 02:55:11,870
I'll be valid.

5878
02:55:12,170 --> 02:55:13,020
And you be,

5879
02:55:13,100 --> 02:55:13,933
um,

5880
02:55:14,530 --> 02:55:15,590
what else to know?

5881
02:55:15,600 --> 02:55:16,330
What are the salt?

5882
02:55:16,330 --> 02:55:16,671
Oh,

5883
02:55:16,671 --> 02:55:18,260
burned me out and bad people.

5884
02:55:18,380 --> 02:55:19,310
I think we should do burn,

5885
02:55:19,360 --> 02:55:20,193
ma'am.

5886
02:55:21,020 --> 02:55:23,000
I think it's a beautiful song and I,

5887
02:55:23,540 --> 02:55:23,930
okay.

5888
02:55:23,930 --> 02:55:27,740
Is it possible to make a request
for anytime in the future?

5889
02:55:27,950 --> 02:55:28,760
Yes sir.

5890
02:55:28,760 --> 02:55:29,301
Could you do,

5891
02:55:29,301 --> 02:55:30,170
let's get wrecked.

5892
02:55:30,230 --> 02:55:31,220
Oh Shit.

5893
02:55:32,440 --> 02:55:33,240
Oh Shit.

5894
02:55:33,240 --> 02:55:34,073
Oh Shit.

5895
02:55:34,500 --> 02:55:35,333
Oh Shit.

5896
02:55:35,920 --> 02:55:36,520
Did double.

5897
02:55:36,520 --> 02:55:37,353
Oh Shit.

5898
02:55:38,150 --> 02:55:39,020
Oh Shit.

5899
02:55:41,090 --> 02:55:43,310
Can we put that on ice
for a second for a second?

5900
02:55:43,630 --> 02:55:46,520
Because we don't have the
necessary instruments.

5901
02:55:46,850 --> 02:55:48,240
We could do like an acoustic version.

5902
02:55:48,250 --> 02:55:49,340
That's all I'm talking about.

5903
02:55:49,700 --> 02:55:51,250
I'm not asking you to bring in a band.

5904
02:55:52,210 --> 02:55:53,680
I think we could do.

5905
02:55:53,700 --> 02:55:54,533
Cool.

5906
02:55:55,170 --> 02:55:56,003
Alright.

5907
02:55:56,210 --> 02:55:57,390
I'm not playing guitar though.

5908
02:55:57,391 --> 02:55:57,521
No,

5909
02:55:57,521 --> 02:55:57,830
no,

5910
02:55:57,830 --> 02:55:58,663
I'll do it.

5911
02:55:59,300 --> 02:56:01,080
I have no idea what you
guys are arguing over.

5912
02:56:02,150 --> 02:56:04,540
That's what I love about being musically.

5913
02:56:05,660 --> 02:56:06,411
Don't listen.

5914
02:56:06,411 --> 02:56:08,120
If you guys are more comfortable
doing something else,

5915
02:56:08,121 --> 02:56:08,510
please do.

5916
02:56:08,510 --> 02:56:09,410
Don't listen to me.

5917
02:56:10,010 --> 02:56:10,843
Let's do burn me out.

5918
02:56:11,490 --> 02:56:13,840
Well now have to do that.

5919
02:56:14,270 --> 02:56:14,601
No,

5920
02:56:14,601 --> 02:56:14,811
no,

5921
02:56:14,811 --> 02:56:15,290
don't.

5922
02:56:15,290 --> 02:56:16,400
I don't want to put you on the spot.

5923
02:56:16,401 --> 02:56:17,061
That's not fair.

5924
02:56:17,061 --> 02:56:18,020
I don't understand.

5925
02:56:18,710 --> 02:56:21,890
I'm happy already so we could
stop this shit right now.

5926
02:56:22,890 --> 02:56:24,440
This shit before it gets ugly.

5927
02:56:24,800 --> 02:56:25,760
We'll all be happy.

5928
02:56:27,810 --> 02:56:28,300
Okay,

5929
02:56:28,300 --> 02:56:31,140
so fuck you.

5930
02:56:31,640 --> 02:56:32,930
I just play whatever you want,

5931
02:56:32,960 --> 02:56:33,590
please.

5932
02:56:33,590 --> 02:56:34,460
Whatever you guys want to walk.

5933
02:56:35,780 --> 02:56:36,613
Go ahead.

5934
02:56:37,400 --> 02:56:40,100
Any song that's in your head right now.

5935
02:56:40,160 --> 02:56:40,640
Ben,

5936
02:56:40,640 --> 02:56:41,473
what's in your head?

5937
02:56:41,720 --> 02:56:43,910
What's in your head do we have for now?

5938
02:56:44,340 --> 02:56:45,173
Bring me out.

5939
02:56:47,960 --> 02:56:49,910
Don't worry about this
fucking stupid clock.

5940
02:56:50,630 --> 02:56:51,740
You can see your ankles.

5941
02:56:52,270 --> 02:56:52,970
What they look like.

5942
02:56:52,970 --> 02:56:54,230
Ride that bit heartbreaking.

5943
02:56:54,440 --> 02:56:55,820
Right into the rocks.

5944
02:56:56,250 --> 02:56:56,460
No,

5945
02:56:56,460 --> 02:56:56,720
it is.

5946

03:02:52,660 --> 03:02:56,500
I just love when I see
someone like when I see

6054
03:02:58,990 --> 03:03:03,990
like a band that like taps into this
weird like very consistent kind of special

6055
03:03:05,891 --> 03:03:09,760
energy that comes from like
songs that just flow your songs.

6056
03:03:09,761 --> 03:03:13,060
Like your songs are so like
representative of you guys.

6057
03:03:13,210 --> 03:03:13,511
You know.

6058
03:03:13,511 --> 03:03:14,150
It's weird.

6059
03:03:14,150 --> 03:03:18,310
Been now knowing you guys as friends
and then like seeing your writing and

6060
03:03:18,311 --> 03:03:21,250
seeing the music and the singing together
and seeing like the new songs being

6061
03:03:21,251 --> 03:03:22,084
created.

6062
03:03:22,090 --> 03:03:23,320
It's really fascinating.

6063
03:03:23,620 --> 03:03:24,550
It's so weird.

6064
03:03:25,330 --> 03:03:29,410
I have no skill ms musically or
talent or knowledge or nothing.

6065
03:03:29,620 --> 03:03:30,980
So when I see the truth it,

6066
03:03:31,090 --> 03:03:32,050
that's 100% true.

6067
03:03:32,350 --> 03:03:32,601
No,

6068
03:03:32,601 --> 03:03:33,281
I'm telling you.

6069
03:03:33,281 --> 03:03:37,930
So when I see like someone who can sing
and people can put music together and

6070
03:03:38,200 --> 03:03:39,430

I've ever worked with.

6078
03:03:51,780 --> 03:03:52,090
Whatever,

6079
03:03:52,090 --> 03:03:53,500
we'd never worked with anybody else.

6080
03:03:54,190 --> 03:03:54,521
Well,

6081
03:03:54,521 --> 03:03:56,310
ever last oh button,

6082
03:03:56,440 --> 03:03:57,740
but never on the road.

6083
03:03:57,910 --> 03:03:58,200
All right.

6084
03:03:58,200 --> 03:03:59,090
Never first show.

6085
03:03:59,450 --> 03:04:00,460
We've talked about doing that.

6086
03:04:00,710 --> 03:04:04,880
That would be the shit you
guys Everlast Joey Diaz

6087
03:04:08,280 --> 03:04:11,550
like it's a lot like comedy
that I stand up at least though.

6088
03:04:11,551 --> 03:04:11,970
I Dunno.

6089
03:04:11,970 --> 03:04:13,300
I've never done standup,

6090
03:04:13,320 --> 03:04:14,870
but I just feel like performing it.

6091
03:04:14,871 --> 03:04:17,490
It's kind of the same energy or,

6092
03:04:17,491 --> 03:04:18,020
or I,

6093
03:04:18,020 --> 03:04:18,341
yeah.

6094
03:04:18,341 --> 03:04:18,910
You know,

6095
03:04:18,910 --> 03:04:19,211
I mean,

6096
03:04:19,211 --> 03:04:24,211
I think it's all like whatever the fuck
you're trying to get out a you through

6097
03:04:24,581 --> 03:04:25,600
whatever medium,

6098
03:04:25,630 --> 03:04:27,860
whether it's playing the violin or,

6099
03:04:28,050 --> 03:04:29,140
or doing stand up.

6100
03:04:29,160 --> 03:04:29,380
Yeah.

6101
03:04:29,380 --> 03:04:29,651
It's all,

6102
03:04:29,651 --> 03:04:29,861
what's,

6103
03:04:29,861 --> 03:04:30,940
what's trying to get out of you,

6104
03:04:31,240 --> 03:04:31,980
whether it's,

6105
03:04:31,980 --> 03:04:32,320
you know,

6106
03:04:32,320 --> 03:04:33,190
building a house,

6107
03:04:33,191 --> 03:04:36,130
whether it's fucking
putting a car together,

6108
03:04:36,420 --> 03:04:36,660
you know,

6109
03:04:36,660 --> 03:04:39,430
like when people do things
that they're trying to express,

6110
03:04:39,630 --> 03:04:43,480
like something about their own curiosity
and creativity is trying to put

6111
03:04:43,481 --> 03:04:44,314
something together.

6112
03:04:44,430 --> 03:04:45,940
It's like it show it
to other people and go,

6113
03:04:45,941 --> 03:04:46,630
look,

6114
03:04:46,630 --> 03:04:47,463
look,

6115
03:04:47,500 --> 03:04:47,921
whether it's,

6116
03:04:47,921 --> 03:04:48,161
you know,

6117
03:04:48,161 --> 03:04:52,690
creating a book or creating an idea that
turns into a song that turns into it

6118
03:04:52,720 --> 03:04:53,110
hit,

6119
03:04:53,110 --> 03:04:53,943
it turns.

6120
03:04:54,010 --> 03:04:56,440
It's like we're trying to get something
to where they could look at that.

6121
03:04:56,930 --> 03:04:58,230
Look how good I found it.

6122
03:04:58,660 --> 03:05:00,070
I found this and the other dimension,

6123
03:05:00,640 --> 03:05:01,690
dimension of creativity.

6124
03:05:01,691 --> 03:05:02,524
I brought it back.

6125
03:05:02,680 --> 03:05:03,190
Look,

6126
03:05:03,190 --> 03:05:03,401
look,

6127
03:05:03,401 --> 03:05:03,521
look,

6128
03:05:03,521 --> 03:05:03,671
look,

6129
03:05:03,671 --> 03:05:04,070
look,

6130
03:05:04,070 --> 03:05:06,940
oh you have to do is you sit
down by yourself and you tune in.

6131
03:05:07,150 --> 03:05:10,060
He just got to tune in and you write
everything down and you figure it out and

6132
03:05:10,061 --> 03:05:11,380
then you practice it and look,

6133
03:05:11,390 --> 03:05:11,530
look,

6134
03:05:11,530 --> 03:05:12,490
look what I got now.

6135
03:05:13,180 --> 03:05:13,331
I mean,

6136
03:05:13,331 --> 03:05:13,840
that's what,

6137
03:05:13,840 --> 03:05:14,680
that's what you're doing.

6138
03:05:14,860 --> 03:05:16,570
That's what anybody who
is creating anything,

6139
03:05:16,571 --> 03:05:18,340
whether they're creating a movie there,

6140
03:05:18,360 --> 03:05:19,690
they're figuring out how to like

6141
03:05:21,220 --> 03:05:24,910
go deep in the imagination and like pull
something out of their fucking head and

6142
03:05:24,911 --> 03:05:25,810
hold it up for you.

6143
03:05:26,560 --> 03:05:27,340
Yeah,

6144
03:05:27,340 --> 03:05:32,340
and what and what's
[inaudible] last words?

6145
03:05:37,430 --> 03:05:38,390
I'm with you my friend.

6146
03:05:38,840 --> 03:05:39,171
I'm like,

6147
03:05:39,171 --> 03:05:39,591
you too,

6148
03:05:39,591 --> 03:05:40,490
but I don't know why.

6149
03:05:41,300 --> 03:05:41,841
Unity.

6150
03:05:41,841 --> 03:05:42,674
Stay together.

6151
03:05:45,980 --> 03:05:46,371
Stay alert.

6152
03:05:46,371 --> 03:05:46,860
Stay alive.

6153
03:05:46,860 --> 03:05:47,693
Susan.

6154
03:05:48,110 --> 03:05:48,800
What'd you call me?

6155
03:05:48,800 --> 03:05:49,730
I said stay alert.

6156
03:05:49,820 --> 03:05:50,650
Stay alive.

6157
03:05:50,650 --> 03:05:55,140
You call me Susan Suzanne all the
way and we don't have to Emma.

6158
03:05:55,150 --> 03:05:55,730
I don't want to.

6159
03:05:55,730 --> 03:05:56,600
That's my new tattoo.

6160
03:05:56,601 --> 03:05:57,434
Susie had all the way

6161
03:05:59,940 --> 03:06:01,590
trend.

6162
03:06:01,730 --> 03:06:04,220
That should be trend
cross country Hashtag.

6163
03:06:06,340 --> 03:06:07,430
If you're thinking about doing that.

6164
03:06:07,431 --> 03:06:08,330
I'm fucking kidding.

6165
03:06:08,570 --> 03:06:09,560
Don't get that Tattoo.

6166
03:06:09,660 --> 03:06:10,493
Jeez.

6167
03:06:11,450 --> 03:06:13,400
You and I are going to
spend some time together.

6168
03:06:15,500 --> 03:06:16,333
That's,

6169
03:06:16,400 --> 03:06:17,233
that's pretty

6170
03:06:18,670 --> 03:06:19,503
big

6171
03:06:20,970 --> 03:06:21,803
words.

6172
03:06:21,890 --> 03:06:22,723
Just kidding.

6173
03:06:24,320 --> 03:06:26,170
Giant gap was too,

6174
03:06:26,260 --> 03:06:26,810
too big.

6175
03:06:26,810 --> 03:06:27,643
It's too great.

6176
03:06:27,710 --> 03:06:30,770
That was should we should fine.

6177
03:06:31,520 --> 03:06:33,440
Particularly rural friends.

6178
03:06:34,500 --> 03:06:35,900
I'm just going to keep
forging ahead with this.

6179
03:06:35,901 --> 03:06:36,734
I don't know what

6180
03:06:41,320 --> 03:06:41,541
this is.

6181
03:06:41,541 --> 03:06:42,200
The Internet,

6182
03:06:42,200 --> 03:06:43,480
what she just said about,

6183
03:06:43,481 --> 03:06:44,240
you know,

6184
03:06:44,240 --> 03:06:45,590
the well of creativity.

6185
03:06:45,650 --> 03:06:50,450
The exciting point to me about
that is it's all the same thing.

6186
03:06:50,451 --> 03:06:50,991
It's the same.

6187
03:06:50,991 --> 03:06:55,290
Well and the only difference then is
just some sort of technical aspect.

6188
03:06:55,320 --> 03:06:56,153
Did you learn

6189
03:06:56,520 --> 03:06:57,330
to do stand up?

6190
03:06:57,330 --> 03:06:58,770
Did you learn to play the guitar?

6191
03:06:59,040 --> 03:07:00,030
Did you learn to make movies?

6192
03:07:00,050 --> 03:07:00,270
It,

6193
03:07:00,270 --> 03:07:01,500
it doesn't make a difference,

6194
03:07:02,310 --> 03:07:02,581
you know,

6195
03:07:02,581 --> 03:07:02,971
at that.

6196
03:07:02,971 --> 03:07:07,910
That's just like what the path of your
creativity flows through for the rest of

6197
03:07:07,911 --> 03:07:11,740
your painting or whether it's
your music or whether it's your,

6198
03:07:11,760 --> 03:07:12,431
whatever it is,

6199
03:07:12,431 --> 03:07:12,750
the path,

6200
03:07:12,750 --> 03:07:14,160
the path of your creativity,

6201
03:07:14,161 --> 03:07:15,120
whatever it flows through.

6202
03:07:16,040 --> 03:07:16,450
Yeah.

6203
03:07:16,450 --> 03:07:16,781
And it's,

6204
03:07:16,781 --> 03:07:19,110
it's like a raw technical
element and that's it.

6205
03:07:19,230 --> 03:07:23,340
So what really matters is where you're
coming from from that well perspective.

6206
03:07:23,460 --> 03:07:24,293
You know,

6207
03:07:24,720 --> 03:07:25,141
maybe,

6208
03:07:25,141 --> 03:07:27,090
but I mean that's the
other thing is that like,

6209
03:07:27,120 --> 03:07:32,120
I feel like certain people are just drawn
to certain certain type of activities,

6210
03:07:33,720 --> 03:07:35,310
certain disciplines,

6211
03:07:35,311 --> 03:07:36,090
certain things.

6212
03:07:36,090 --> 03:07:37,710
And when they resist that,

6213
03:07:38,370 --> 03:07:40,810
there's like huge issues
with humans crease.

6214
03:07:40,830 --> 03:07:41,730
But I totally,

6215
03:07:41,970 --> 03:07:43,890
that's exactly what we
were talking about earlier.

6216
03:07:44,370 --> 03:07:47,730
And it's like a huge loss of
confidence for people suppression.

6217
03:07:47,980 --> 03:07:48,230
Well,

6218
03:07:48,230 --> 03:07:48,660
you just,

6219
03:07:48,660 --> 03:07:50,010
you feel bad.

6220
03:07:50,040 --> 03:07:55,040
You feel like it's almost like there's
a just grand puzzle going on and you,

6221
03:07:56,160 --> 03:07:56,701
you know,

6222
03:07:56,701 --> 03:07:58,860
you just kinda like going towards which,

6223
03:07:59,030 --> 03:08:02,730
what's pulling you and is it healthy
that it's pulling you in this direction?

6224
03:08:02,731 --> 03:08:03,900
Like examine it,

6225
03:08:03,930 --> 03:08:04,591
figure it out,

6226
03:08:04,591 --> 03:08:05,424
figure out what it is,

6227
03:08:05,460 --> 03:08:07,010
and if you could resist it because you're,

6228
03:08:07,050 --> 03:08:07,321
well,

6229
03:08:07,321 --> 03:08:09,480
it's not a sure thing or it's not,

6230
03:08:09,810 --> 03:08:10,620
how do you feel about that

6231
03:08:10,620 --> 03:08:12,300
conformity then in that respect?

6232
03:08:12,301 --> 03:08:12,930
Like,

6233
03:08:12,930 --> 03:08:14,640
like you being Joe,

6234
03:08:14,670 --> 03:08:14,941
you know,

6235
03:08:14,941 --> 03:08:17,880
and then you're in certain
social settings or whatever.

6236
03:08:18,120 --> 03:08:18,953
Do you,

6237
03:08:19,230 --> 03:08:19,910
um,

6238
03:08:19,910 --> 03:08:20,550
you know,

6239
03:08:20,550 --> 03:08:21,540
are you malleable?

6240
03:08:21,780 --> 03:08:24,030
Can you change into a way that like,

6241
03:08:24,480 --> 03:08:25,021
you're like,

6242
03:08:25,021 --> 03:08:25,321
oh yeah,

6243
03:08:25,321 --> 03:08:26,220
I'm with this crowd,

6244
03:08:26,221 --> 03:08:26,900
or

6245
03:08:26,900 --> 03:08:27,081
Oh,

6246
03:08:27,081 --> 03:08:27,550
I can talk,

6247
03:08:27,550 --> 03:08:28,371
I can talk to anybody.

6248
03:08:28,371 --> 03:08:28,511
I mean,

6249
03:08:28,511 --> 03:08:28,650
yeah,

6250
03:08:28,650 --> 03:08:31,900
I sit in a room full of
born again Christians and
have a friendly conversation

6251
03:08:31,910 --> 03:08:32,743
with them.

6252
03:08:32,840 --> 03:08:34,850
I probably couldn't have a decade ago.

6253
03:08:35,120 --> 03:08:35,690
Yeah.

6254
03:08:35,690 --> 03:08:40,430
But somewhere along the line I've realized
it doesn't matter if you're right or

6255
03:08:40,431 --> 03:08:41,264
I'm right.

6256
03:08:41,370 --> 03:08:41,660
Uh,

6257
03:08:41,660 --> 03:08:42,950
it's not a fucking game.

6258
03:08:43,250 --> 03:08:44,030
Okay.

6259
03:08:44,030 --> 03:08:47,000
And so instead of
quantifying it as a game,

6260
03:08:47,030 --> 03:08:49,850
which is like a thing
that guys love to do,

6261
03:08:50,000 --> 03:08:51,020
we love to do it.

6262
03:08:51,021 --> 03:08:51,950
We want to be right.

6263
03:08:52,340 --> 03:08:53,173
People love to do.

6264
03:08:53,210 --> 03:08:54,080
People love to do it.

6265
03:08:54,081 --> 03:08:57,590
But guys specifically because
guys likes me feel better,

6266
03:08:57,800 --> 03:08:59,930
guys like the fucking win arguments,

6267
03:08:59,990 --> 03:09:00,770
you know,

6268
03:09:00,770 --> 03:09:02,430
it's a barbarian thing.

6269
03:09:02,431 --> 03:09:03,620
It's some fucking weird,

6270
03:09:03,740 --> 03:09:04,573
you know,

6271
03:09:05,690 --> 03:09:06,051
pubs,

6272
03:09:06,051 --> 03:09:06,771
sword fight,

6273
03:09:06,771 --> 03:09:10,160
shit leftover from the fucking dark ages.

6274
03:09:10,390 --> 03:09:11,140
I don't know.

6275
03:09:11,140 --> 03:09:12,190
So sorry.

6276
03:09:12,250 --> 03:09:12,611
You know,

6277
03:09:12,611 --> 03:09:14,410
I don't know if it's a
gender specific thing.

6278
03:09:14,411 --> 03:09:16,210
I think sometimes you just
want to connect with people.

6279
03:09:16,211 --> 03:09:18,340
It's not so much about dudes and,

6280
03:09:18,440 --> 03:09:19,211
or ladies,

6281
03:09:19,211 --> 03:09:19,511
you know,

6282
03:09:19,511 --> 03:09:23,740
I think I used to feel really guilty
about being able to conform so easily

6283
03:09:23,741 --> 03:09:24,760
because I love everybody.

6284
03:09:25,090 --> 03:09:25,860
Cause I,

6285
03:09:25,860 --> 03:09:26,220
I would,

6286
03:09:26,220 --> 03:09:26,950
I can,

6287
03:09:26,950 --> 03:09:28,390
I can hang out all the time.

6288
03:09:28,391 --> 03:09:29,020
And then,

6289
03:09:29,020 --> 03:09:29,681
and then I was like,

6290
03:09:29,681 --> 03:09:31,960
well why did I just like exploit myself?

6291
03:09:31,961 --> 03:09:32,100
Right?

6292
03:09:32,100 --> 03:09:34,450
Exploit parts of myself to fit in here,

6293
03:09:34,510 --> 03:09:35,343
you know what I mean?

6294
03:09:35,560 --> 03:09:37,030
But at the same time,

6295
03:09:37,600 --> 03:09:40,030
I think it's okay to just be,

6296
03:09:40,090 --> 03:09:40,630
um,

6297
03:09:40,630 --> 03:09:44,290
have accessible aspects of
yourself to connect with people.

6298
03:09:44,550 --> 03:09:44,791
Yeah.

6299
03:09:44,791 --> 03:09:45,420
I mean,

6300
03:09:45,420 --> 03:09:46,110
absolutely.

6301
03:09:46,110 --> 03:09:46,380
I mean,

6302
03:09:46,380 --> 03:09:47,690
are you going to occasionally run it?

6303
03:09:48,060 --> 03:09:48,270
That's

6304
03:09:48,270 --> 03:09:49,230
like a male.

6305
03:09:49,680 --> 03:09:51,810
I think that's across the board.

6306
03:09:52,170 --> 03:09:52,530
Yeah.

6307
03:09:52,530 --> 03:09:52,711
No,

6308
03:09:52,711 --> 03:09:53,590
that's across the board.

6309
03:09:53,680 --> 03:09:54,150
I agree

6310
03:09:54,150 --> 03:09:56,020
with what you just said it.

6311
03:09:56,900 --> 03:09:57,790
I think,

6312
03:09:58,060 --> 03:10:01,810
I dunno the being argumentative or like,

6313
03:10:02,200 --> 03:10:04,480
I mean women driving towards conflict,

6314
03:10:04,510 --> 03:10:06,610
man are women are we all are,

6315
03:10:06,611 --> 03:10:06,970
right?

6316
03:10:06,970 --> 03:10:07,331
It's just,

6317
03:10:07,331 --> 03:10:09,070
it's not really gender dependent.

6318
03:10:09,110 --> 03:10:09,490
Yeah,

6319
03:10:09,490 --> 03:10:14,350
but I think there's a extra like sort
of dominated or trait that a lot of men

6320
03:10:14,530 --> 03:10:15,400
tend to have,

6321
03:10:15,730 --> 03:10:16,031
you know,

6322
03:10:16,031 --> 03:10:17,950
that want them to win arguments,

6323
03:10:17,951 --> 03:10:19,540
especially when this podcast,

6324
03:10:20,820 --> 03:10:21,100
how do you,

6325
03:10:21,100 --> 03:10:24,970
when it is this kind of game planning,

6326
03:10:24,971 --> 03:10:27,590
like the dominant one guys will all that.

6327
03:10:27,820 --> 03:10:29,350
I feel like we're all winning his pocket.

6328
03:10:29,440 --> 03:10:31,410
I like the way you talk.

6329
03:10:31,730 --> 03:10:33,490
You're like a fucking politician.

6330
03:10:34,750 --> 03:10:35,381
Oh my God.

6331
03:10:35,381 --> 03:10:36,560
I got a new name for you.

6332
03:10:36,940 --> 03:10:37,751
I got a new name for you.

6333
03:10:37,751 --> 03:10:38,970
This is what you just did it.

6334
03:10:38,971 --> 03:10:39,940
So Jesus,

6335
03:10:40,110 --> 03:10:40,620
Jesus,

6336
03:10:40,620 --> 03:10:41,453
Jesus,

6337
03:10:42,310 --> 03:10:43,143
Jesus,

6338
03:10:43,250 --> 03:10:46,720
in case for cheesy savior,

6339
03:10:47,270 --> 03:10:48,280
you're Jesus.

6340
03:10:48,340 --> 03:10:49,173
Pray for cheeses.

6341
03:10:50,090 --> 03:10:52,930
Do you know who tells us that
joke in case of Ben's mother,

6342
03:10:54,190 --> 03:10:55,023
Jesus.

6343
03:10:56,080 --> 03:10:57,310
She told you that Jesus chose,

6344
03:10:57,311 --> 03:10:58,144
she told me.

6345
03:10:59,860 --> 03:11:00,521
I swear to God.

6346
03:11:00,521 --> 03:11:01,540
I thought I was making that up.

6347
03:11:01,660 --> 03:11:01,790
No,

6348
03:11:01,790 --> 03:11:02,440
Ben,

6349
03:11:02,440 --> 03:11:03,370
you guys heard that before?

6350
03:11:03,371 --> 03:11:08,371
Is there a cheeses choke the cheesy Jesus
Ben Ben's mom from Wisconsin cheese.

6351
03:11:09,960 --> 03:11:10,793
Oh,

6352
03:11:10,810 --> 03:11:13,950
in Kaiso emergency in case of emergency.

6353
03:11:14,340 --> 03:11:15,173
Pray for cheese.

6354
03:11:15,450 --> 03:11:16,340
Oh boy.

6355
03:11:21,690 --> 03:11:22,151
I'm sorry.

6356
03:11:22,151 --> 03:11:24,400
But that is an acceptable racial,

6357
03:11:24,550 --> 03:11:25,510
not racist.

6358
03:11:26,860 --> 03:11:28,730
I don't feel like there
was any anger involved.

6359
03:11:29,280 --> 03:11:32,860
I feel like it was all done in the
spirit of love and the reality of the way

6360
03:11:32,861 --> 03:11:34,670
some mother fuckers talk and out.

6361
03:11:34,870 --> 03:11:37,540
It's not bad the way they speak.

6362
03:11:37,541 --> 03:11:39,610
English is better than the
way I would speak Spanish.

6363
03:11:39,640 --> 03:11:40,473
Okay.

6364
03:11:41,050 --> 03:11:42,610
And my mom's heart Ecuadorian.

6365
03:11:43,780 --> 03:11:44,613
Amazing.

6366
03:11:45,050 --> 03:11:45,970
We're even safer.

6367
03:11:46,180 --> 03:11:47,230
We're even safer now.

6368
03:11:47,231 --> 03:11:48,064
Joe,

6369
03:11:48,520 --> 03:11:48,860
is that,

6370
03:11:48,860 --> 03:11:53,860
what was it making you said that Joe
on this podcast and I knew it knew it

6371
03:11:56,051 --> 03:11:56,471
would.

6372
03:11:56,471 --> 03:11:57,310
How dare you?

6373
03:11:57,700 --> 03:11:58,000
No,

6374
03:11:58,000 --> 03:11:58,781
it wasn't doubting.

6375
03:11:58,781 --> 03:11:59,381
I was just like,

6376
03:11:59,381 --> 03:12:00,214
wow,

6377
03:12:00,340 --> 03:12:05,290
this is the least musical and
most silly of all the podcasts

6378
03:12:10,400 --> 03:12:11,220
on them.

6379
03:12:11,220 --> 03:12:12,580
What did we do this so horrible.

6380
03:12:12,581 --> 03:12:13,414
We had some fun.

6381
03:12:13,810 --> 03:12:14,351
What did we do?

6382
03:12:14,351 --> 03:12:16,480
We had a few good friends,

6383
03:12:16,481 --> 03:12:17,950
had a bunch of laughs together.

6384
03:12:18,040 --> 03:12:18,873
What did we do?

6385
03:12:20,760 --> 03:12:21,540
Air Raid.

6386
03:12:21,540 --> 03:12:22,373
I heard,

6387
03:12:23,110 --> 03:12:24,700
apparently I googled it.

6388
03:12:25,150 --> 03:12:27,820
There was a jet that invaded the airspace.

6389
03:12:27,910 --> 03:12:29,110
No Shit.

6390
03:12:29,170 --> 03:12:29,840
I don't know.

6391
03:12:29,840 --> 03:12:30,110
Sure.

6392
03:12:30,110 --> 03:12:30,700
Planes.

6393
03:12:30,700 --> 03:12:31,750
Sort of a plane.

6394
03:12:32,440 --> 03:12:33,400
That was 2013

6395
03:12:35,140 --> 03:12:37,720
Obama's entire incorrect.

6396
03:12:38,140 --> 03:12:40,510
I just googled it and
looked at the first one.

6397
03:12:40,511 --> 03:12:42,670
I didn't even look at
the date it was trying to

6398
03:12:44,260 --> 03:12:47,350
smoldering 2013 that's what happened.

6399
03:12:47,810 --> 03:12:48,643
Do you want to find

6400
03:12:50,170 --> 03:12:51,860
out about the 2000 event,

6401
03:12:51,890 --> 03:12:52,130
which

6402
03:12:52,130 --> 03:12:54,530
I was accidentally referencing.

6403
03:12:57,530 --> 03:12:58,363
How about this?

6404
03:12:59,610 --> 03:13:03,020
Cause the ball keeps rolling.

6405
03:13:03,720 --> 03:13:05,240
Hey Ho Ho.

6406
03:13:05,420 --> 03:13:08,480
Hey you gotta you gotta keep rolling.

6407
03:13:10,080 --> 03:13:12,320
If you don't snooze,

6408
03:13:12,730 --> 03:13:13,563
you lose.

6409
03:13:13,610 --> 03:13:16,700
That's Brian Dj Red Bank.

6410
03:13:18,380 --> 03:13:19,213
Sorry.

6411
03:13:19,830 --> 03:13:20,663

Oh my God.

6423
03:13:41,470 --> 03:13:42,303
I would call it.

6424
03:13:42,640 --> 03:13:44,110
Is it a beekeeper fetish?

Rudimentary level kid
grabbing like chokes there.

We're using the fucking beekeepers out.
