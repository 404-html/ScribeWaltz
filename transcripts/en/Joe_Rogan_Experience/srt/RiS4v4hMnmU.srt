1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,860
Hello Freak bitches,

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:03,311
right?

3
00:00:03,311 --> 00:00:05,710
It's very different than a regular movie.

4
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:08,920
What did he start doing these cereal?

5
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:10,180
I mean,

6
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:13,030
I think of like game of
Thrones is a serial movie,

7
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:13,600
right?

8
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:16,060
There's a hundred parts to this movie,

9
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:18,130
but it's a big giant ass movie.

10
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:18,701
I mean it's,

11
00:00:18,701 --> 00:00:19,210
it's,

12
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:22,540
it's so much better than a
regular television show in
terms of like it's special

13
00:00:22,541 --> 00:00:25,390
effects and the grandness of it all.

14
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:29,530
If they can figure out how
to film something like that,

15
00:00:29,531 --> 00:00:31,690
but let you participate in it.

16
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:33,840
I mean,

17
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,840
I'll let you strap on to some three d
treadmill type thing and move around in

18
00:00:43,631 --> 00:00:48,070
this fucking weird world and follow
these people on their journeys.

19
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:51,520
Be Right there when the ORC
slaughter the people like God,

20
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:56,110
like the blood splatter in front of you
and you're watching them get chopped up

21
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:59,260
and then you're going to go over
the mountain to where the castle is.

22
00:00:59,261 --> 00:01:01,000
You have to actually
walk over the mountain,

23
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:03,040
but as you walk over the mountain,

24
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:04,660
horses ride beside you,

25
00:01:04,661 --> 00:01:05,650
you get to see them.

26
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:07,863
I mean,

27
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:11,030
we're real close to something like that.

28
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:13,550
I feel like that's only a few years away.

29
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:15,680
Avatar world coming out soon.

30
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:17,150
Like in Disney at Disney.

31
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:18,020
Disney world.

32
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:18,110
Oh,

33
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:18,943
what are I going to do?

34
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:19,810
How's that going to work?

35
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:20,440
One of the,

36
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:22,220
they've been showing
some things like this is,

37
00:01:22,221 --> 00:01:25,790
I think this is just a
imagineering whoa idea,

38
00:01:25,791 --> 00:01:28,980
but this like you're gonna be able to
take a boat ride through the middle of the

39
00:01:28,981 --> 00:01:30,060
Navi forest.

40
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:30,591
Oh,

41
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:30,831
okay.

42
00:01:30,831 --> 00:01:32,600
Well that sounds like it's a small world.

43
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,110
It's going to be a lower step,

44
00:01:34,111 --> 00:01:37,200
but they're going to have some VR stuff
you're gonna be able to float through

45
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:38,370
and go on the,

46
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:39,810
wow.

47
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:41,540
Here's how they are looking
to Disney world right now.

48
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:42,650
Oh Wow.

49
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,011
So they're,

50
00:01:43,011 --> 00:01:44,570
they're building it right now,

51
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,280
but you're obviously not
to be able to walk on that.

52
00:01:46,281 --> 00:01:47,570
When is this going to take place?

53
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:50,660
I think it opens this later this year.

54
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:52,450
Disneyland does next years.

55
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:53,503
But what you're saying,

56
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:57,590
what if they just took the extension of
that and just instead of like making the

57
00:01:57,591 --> 00:01:58,371
avatar movie,

58
00:01:58,371 --> 00:01:58,911
they just went,

59
00:01:58,911 --> 00:01:59,121
look,

60
00:01:59,121 --> 00:02:03,040
Avatar five is avatar world and
if you want to come live it out,

61
00:02:03,041 --> 00:02:06,790
you've got to come to Disney world and
pay 50 bucks or 100 bucks or 150 bucks,

62
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,313
300 bucks,

63
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:09,730
something crazy to do it.

64
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,010
Now you're talking.

65
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:12,481
That would be all,

66
00:02:12,481 --> 00:02:13,271
this is what you do.

67
00:02:13,271 --> 00:02:14,920
You construct that world.

68
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,440
And then once you're in that world,

69
00:02:17,441 --> 00:02:22,180
then you put on the VR goggles and it
turns everything into fluorescent neon

70
00:02:22,181 --> 00:02:25,720
Greens and Blues and
like the Avatar world.

71
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:29,590
You could see everything and then you
actually watched the movie play out in

72
00:02:29,591 --> 00:02:30,110
there.

73
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:31,180
Ooh,

74
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:33,430
that'd be a nerd gas me.

75
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:34,413
I feel like

76
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,210
closer to something like that then.

77
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:40,340
Well we are everyone being able
to do with this probably span.

78
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:44,440
Well the thing about that though is it's
going to require so much resources and

79
00:02:44,441 --> 00:02:46,990
land and money and that doesn't change,

80
00:02:46,991 --> 00:02:47,560
right?

81
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:50,680
But we have these notions of fairness
play out in different ways as we're

82
00:02:50,681 --> 00:02:51,490
adults,

83
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:56,490
but different political
groups and different tribes
favor these other notions of

84
00:02:57,191 --> 00:02:58,810
fairness more than some others.

85
00:02:58,811 --> 00:03:00,220
So take for example,

86
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:02,530
the issue of pro life versus pro choice.

87
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:03,280
Right.

88
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:03,551
Okay.

89
00:03:03,551 --> 00:03:05,050
So you have,

90
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:05,540
let's just,

91
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:06,310
here's the question.

92
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:09,190
Are Liberals prolife or
are liberals pro choice,

93
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,120
they're more pro choice
on the issue of abortion.

94
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:13,750
Yes.

95
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:16,480
So on abortion it's about freedom,

96
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:17,350
right?

97
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:18,080
Okay.

98
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:18,520
Uh,

99
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:18,820
well,

100
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:20,350
it's very much about women's rights,

101
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:21,430
women's freedom.

102
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:22,090
It's a big,

103
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:22,301
uh,

104
00:03:22,301 --> 00:03:23,021
it's not,

105
00:03:23,021 --> 00:03:26,050
it's not even thought of it
like as a human freedom because,

106
00:03:26,051 --> 00:03:26,500
uh,

107
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:26,860
it's,

108
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:27,820
it's about the woman,

109
00:03:27,821 --> 00:03:28,690
not about the child.

110
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,470
That's right.

111
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:31,210
So it's about the woman's freedom,

112
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:31,521
right?

113
00:03:31,521 --> 00:03:33,490
So they've hooked up to
that idea of freedom,

114
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:33,911
right?

115
00:03:33,911 --> 00:03:34,480
Yes.

116
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:34,960
And then,

117
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,201
you know,

118
00:03:35,201 --> 00:03:36,850
conservatives are pro life.

119
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:39,880
This is about caring and protecting
from harm and all that sort of stuff.

120
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,450
Okay.

121
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:41,530
Unless you're talking about war,

122
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:43,030
unless you're talking about war.

123
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,740
And that's exactly the point is,

124
00:03:44,741 --> 00:03:45,100
is that,

125
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:45,520
you know,

126
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:50,520
are all humans hypocrites or is it that
we selectively use these same intuitions

127
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:53,020
that we all have for different causes?

128
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:53,861
So if you look at,

129
00:03:53,861 --> 00:03:54,341
for example,

130
00:03:54,341 --> 00:03:56,800
gun control are liberals
pro choice or pro life,

131
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:58,810
they're definitely prolife.

132
00:03:58,870 --> 00:03:59,760
Aha.

133
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:04,030
So what you see is that on abortion
they're pro choice and on gun control

134
00:04:04,031 --> 00:04:04,840
they're pro life.

135
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,400
But then when it comes the other way,

136
00:04:06,401 --> 00:04:07,234
exactly.

137
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:12,100
Publicans are pro choice
when it comes to guns.

138
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,170
So we all have the same intuitions,

139
00:04:14,171 --> 00:04:18,190
but we use them in different ways
to justify our political arguments.

140
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:18,311
Well,

141
00:04:18,311 --> 00:04:21,640
what's interesting too is that there's
two positions that are taking place in

142
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:22,750
the American psyche,

143
00:04:22,751 --> 00:04:23,171
at least,

144
00:04:23,171 --> 00:04:28,171
that were almost reluctantly agreeing
to and is that the Republicans are,

145
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,750
or the Conservatives are more realistic,

146
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:33,610
more hardcore,

147
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:36,400
ready to kick ass ready
to fight for what's right.

148
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:41,140
Whereas liberals are bunch of whiny
crybabies looking to give away their money

149
00:04:41,141 --> 00:04:42,640
and they creating welfare babies.

150
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:42,881
Well,

151
00:04:42,881 --> 00:04:44,840
that certainly just if it wasn't for,

152
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:46,660
if it wasn't for the conservatives,

153
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:49,840
these fucking people would be
speaking German and living in Vietnam.

154
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:50,830
Right.

155
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:51,370
Well,

156
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:52,270
all tribes,

157
00:04:52,271 --> 00:04:53,110
the nature of tribes,

158
00:04:53,111 --> 00:04:55,930
you tell something that makes your
tribe look like the good guys,

159
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:56,600
right?

160
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,433
That the sport,

161
00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:00,070
is it ever going to be clean?

162
00:05:00,071 --> 00:05:02,770
But it's way cleaner now in the
UFC that it's ever been before.

163
00:05:02,771 --> 00:05:04,450
But I think there's also,

164
00:05:04,451 --> 00:05:07,720
I like the fact that one fcs available
for guys who don't want to be clean.

165
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:08,091
Yeah.

166
00:05:08,091 --> 00:05:09,400
Rises available for guys.

167
00:05:09,401 --> 00:05:10,270
We don't want to be clean.

168
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:10,781
You know,

169
00:05:10,781 --> 00:05:11,890
there's an argument either way,

170
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,600
there's an argument for the pride way,

171
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:16,030
which was everybody knew
that everybody was on it.

172
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:16,620
Hey there,

173
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:17,530
I tested pride,

174
00:05:17,531 --> 00:05:17,800
right?

175
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:21,730
We're [inaudible].

176
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:22,781
Hey boss,

177
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:23,290
what's this?

178
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:25,060
Why is this a vial?

179
00:05:25,061 --> 00:05:25,871
Just sitting here?

180
00:05:25,871 --> 00:05:26,704
I mean buddy,

181
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:29,440
I did it cold or the boss store.

182
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:32,410
I was going backstage with
the camera showing everybody,

183
00:05:32,411 --> 00:05:32,801
hey man,

184
00:05:32,801 --> 00:05:33,161
what's up?

185
00:05:33,161 --> 00:05:33,550
Hey you,

186
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:34,430
this is how you look at that.

187
00:05:34,431 --> 00:05:35,920
And it's frighteningly
training and you know what?

188
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:36,311
Then I say,

189
00:05:36,311 --> 00:05:36,850
okay,

190
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:38,800
we walk into the room from the doctors.

191
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:43,090
So I opened the door and I looked at the
side and I see all the pts there would

192
00:05:43,091 --> 00:05:44,050
hold little sticks on them,

193
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:44,560
right?

194
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,390
And I close the door right
away and I look in the camera,

195
00:05:46,391 --> 00:05:46,631
I said,

196
00:05:46,631 --> 00:05:47,950
give me one moment to the very busy,

197
00:05:47,951 --> 00:05:49,240
let me walk in and ask for permission.

198
00:05:49,241 --> 00:05:52,130
So I walk in and I grab
one of those cups and I,

199
00:05:52,131 --> 00:05:52,781
she green tea,

200
00:05:52,781 --> 00:05:55,060
I fill it up and it put
the same cup next to it.

201
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:56,980
So then when you weren't even,

202
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:59,240
you should open it allowed
to that and be that close.

203
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,190
So I'm,

204
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:00,381
yeah,

205
00:06:00,381 --> 00:06:00,680
yeah,

206
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:00,931
she,

207
00:06:00,931 --> 00:06:01,070
she,

208
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:01,640
I could have got,

209
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,411
can contaminate it,

210
00:06:02,411 --> 00:06:03,050
everything.

211
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:04,640
So I'm walking in and I'm saying,

212
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:04,821
oh,

213
00:06:04,821 --> 00:06:05,930
these are the doctors here.

214
00:06:05,931 --> 00:06:06,760
And they looked at us and think,

215
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,390
Oh hey,

216
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:08,223
the p test.

217
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:08,891
I said,

218
00:06:08,891 --> 00:06:09,724
man,

219
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:12,860
wouldn't it be great if you
can taste what fighter it is

220
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:16,640
and these people,

221
00:06:16,641 --> 00:06:17,580
they looked at me as,

222
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:20,990
I take my green tea and
I take the thing off.

223
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:21,730
And they go like,

224
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:21,861
no,

225
00:06:21,861 --> 00:06:22,001
no,

226
00:06:22,001 --> 00:06:22,120
no,

227
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:22,211
no,

228
00:06:22,211 --> 00:06:22,360
no,

229
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,160
no.

230
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,260
Can I take a little sip?

231
00:06:24,261 --> 00:06:24,980
And I said,

232
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:25,450
no.

233
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:25,990
I go,

234
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:27,000
it's out a Coleman or

235
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:34,730
there is a clear illustration.

236
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:36,461
Yeah,

237
00:06:36,461 --> 00:06:37,350
not water.

238
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:40,270
And it's all at the end of the day,

239
00:06:40,271 --> 00:06:43,690
a manifestation of probably some
shit you haven't worked out,

240
00:06:43,691 --> 00:06:45,910
which is still a feeling of insecurity.

241
00:06:45,911 --> 00:06:47,290
Still a hole you can't fill.

242
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:47,710
Oh,

243
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:51,070
I hope I can move away from that
savage with a Martini in your hand.

244
00:06:51,071 --> 00:06:52,420
The giant hard Dick.

245
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,590
And you've paid 30 Russian hookers to
hang out with you for a month cause your,

246
00:06:56,591 --> 00:06:59,020
your doctor found a blemish on your tumor.

247
00:06:59,120 --> 00:06:59,950
Well that's a different,

248
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:03,880
some shit going down and it's growing now
it's starting to cut off the supply to

249
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:04,450
your,

250
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:05,260
your blood.

251
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:05,800
Yeah.

252
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,500
You're getting blood clots and
your feet go numb at night.

253
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:09,610
I wonder what I would do.

254
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:11,920
Let me think about that cause
so let's just take that.

255
00:07:11,921 --> 00:07:12,670
I got him a hug.

256
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:12,881
Give me,

257
00:07:12,881 --> 00:07:13,714
so how much time do I have?

258
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,673
Not much.

259
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:15,410
Uh,

260
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:16,630
you can wake up every morning.

261
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:16,870
You,

262
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:20,230
you set the alarm clock for 5:00 AM
with Creedence Clearwater revival,

263
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:21,370
bad moon rising.

264
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:24,970
Your Papa Viagara start
drinking your guts.

265
00:07:24,971 --> 00:07:25,780
Enormous.

266
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:26,190
It's hitting,

267
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:26,890
definitely,

268
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:28,060
definitely have cancer.

269
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:28,481
You know,

270
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:29,141
you have cancer.

271
00:07:29,141 --> 00:07:30,750
There's probably some
internal shit going on,

272
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,620
but your dick still gets hard.

273
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:35,470
And you still got $7
billion to burn through.

274
00:07:35,471 --> 00:07:36,580
Your kids are calling you.

275
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:37,510
You look at the phone like,

276
00:07:37,511 --> 00:07:38,320
fuck you.

277
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,131
You're not getting any of this.

278
00:07:39,131 --> 00:07:40,060
I started a school,

279
00:07:40,061 --> 00:07:40,894
dude.

280
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:42,603
Ah,

281
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:43,783
every day.

282
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:44,891
Every everyday.

283
00:07:44,891 --> 00:07:47,800
The grilling steaks onboard chef.

284
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:48,491
I call every girl,

285
00:07:48,491 --> 00:07:49,310
mom and Mama.

286
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:50,440
Everything is steak.

287
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,500
Steak in the morning.

288
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:56,480
Who gives a fuck Martinis and stay far?

289
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,190
Yeah.

290
00:07:57,190 --> 00:08:01,000
Martini steak and a fucking
mason jar filled with Viagara

291
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:04,900
down those fuckers all day.

292
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:05,890
Can't hear a thing.

293
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,660
Ears are closed up.

294
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:10,200
Just a big old cray cray.

295
00:08:10,201 --> 00:08:10,270
A

296
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:11,140
pubic mound.

297
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:11,471
Yeah.

298
00:08:11,471 --> 00:08:14,920
Your head is constantly aching from
the Viagara flowing through your veins.

299
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:20,050
Why am I just tick is like fucking hammer.

300
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:22,180
I guess I just do some fucking,

301
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:25,640
you've got a giant fat belly
with white hair all over.

302
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,720
Just a big fat white in your Dick.

303
00:08:28,721 --> 00:08:30,040
Smells like cheese.

304
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:33,190
It takes smells like old chambers.

305
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:35,230
Why this not going to happen to me?

306
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:37,600
You and the girls were all have
those shoes with the red bottoms.

307
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:39,930
You know those shoes are
the Christian Louis towns?

308
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:40,151
Yeah,

309
00:08:40,151 --> 00:08:40,984
that's the ones.

310
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:46,000
That's why I get a hard on when I buy
gifts for those girls all have that.

311
00:08:46,001 --> 00:08:49,210
You make them keep those shoes on and
you fucked their mouths where they're

312
00:08:49,211 --> 00:08:52,780
lying on their stomach so that the shoes
are up in the air so you can see the

313
00:08:52,781 --> 00:08:53,620
bottom of the shoes.

314
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,930
What about for you about this?

315
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:00,180
About this way and then
your heart attacks.

316
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:01,560
And then when I come I go,

317
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:01,950
I go,

318
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:02,940
you're welcome.

319
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:07,410
And when you die they just throw you
overboard cause he's bitches hate you now.

320
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:08,550
So like he's dead,

321
00:09:08,551 --> 00:09:12,330
he's finally fucking dead and you
even get to go through the will.

322
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:12,721
What's in the,

323
00:09:12,721 --> 00:09:12,901
well,

324
00:09:12,901 --> 00:09:13,141
what's it?

325
00:09:13,141 --> 00:09:13,501
What do I get?

326
00:09:13,501 --> 00:09:14,334
Do I get anything?

327
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:17,220
And then nothing you don't get often
they just drag him by his ankles.

328
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:18,270
Chuck them over the side.

329
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:18,960
Wow.

330
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,040
The sharks come and eat them.

331
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:20,671
They won't eat me.

332
00:09:20,671 --> 00:09:21,530
I'm so full of sin.

333
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,480
So full of sand and just the sharks.

334
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,640
Sharks will eat a shoe.

335
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:27,870
Well not,

336
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:28,291
