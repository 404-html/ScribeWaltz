00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:01,960
Good godly moodley did remove me.

I'm sure someone must must've Joey.

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:07,230
People steal everything.

4
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:08,140
Yeah.

5
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:08,973
This is

6
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:12,300
fucking unbelievable.

7
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:13,500
Joey's in the far right.

8
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:19,200
That's insane that we were so
cute at the sexy lucky seven.

9
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:20,461
Can you get it?

10
00:00:20,461 --> 00:00:21,580
So just his whole body fills.

11
00:00:21,581 --> 00:00:24,120
His mom was 44 I was
44 there was an uncle.

12
00:00:24,121 --> 00:00:24,954
Lucky seven.

13
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:27,593
Wow.

14
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:28,643
That's so crazy.

15
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:30,660
Wow.

16
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:31,740
Look at you dude.

17
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:33,330
So how old are you in this picture?

18
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:37,350
1414 God damn Joe.

19
00:00:37,351 --> 00:00:37,890
You cute.

20
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:38,850
You're cute as a button.

21
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:42,020
Look at David Ruiz turning around and
talking to the microphone so people can

22
00:00:42,021 --> 00:00:42,854
hear this too.

23
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,070
That kid right there really tough on this
screen to that kid with the Afro was a

24
00:00:47,071 --> 00:00:48,240
very interesting story.

25
00:00:48,241 --> 00:00:48,751
This guy right here,

26
00:00:48,751 --> 00:00:49,371
because we were,

27
00:00:49,371 --> 00:00:51,600
we were horrible basketball
team at Mckinley.

28
00:00:51,601 --> 00:00:52,434
Can you go full screen?

29
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:54,990
Moved in our neighborhood.

30
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:56,550
He could jump.

31
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:00,690
He was five foot eight but this kid
could fucking jump like Julius Erving.

32
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:01,950
So he was Dominican.

33
00:01:01,951 --> 00:01:03,180
His name was Louis Hernandez.

34
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:04,450
I'm from Jersey.

35
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:05,100
Just playing that.

36
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:07,020
They just cut it short and
called him Louie the Nigga.

37
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:07,741
They said,

38
00:01:07,741 --> 00:01:08,161
fuck it.

39
00:01:08,161 --> 00:01:09,360
We don't care if he's Dominican.

40
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:10,710
We're not going to even think about that.

41
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:11,670
We're just gonna.

42
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:15,000
This is David [inaudible] as they
called him that to his face too,

43
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:16,000
like Louise and Megan.

44
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,730
When did he get pissed?

45
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,350
Fuck you bitch.

46
00:01:19,351 --> 00:01:20,220
And he was a tough kid.

47
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:20,880
He got manager.

48
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,930
When you come to terms like I think he
bit slap two or three people he did was

49
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:29,460
we used to do acid when we first started
smoking weed in the eighth grade,

50
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:33,870
we go behind the soccer field and north
Bergen and he let us blow smoke into his

51
00:01:33,871 --> 00:01:38,560
afro and see the smoke come
out of the [inaudible].

52
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,810
How cool is

53
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:43,261
this was the crew,

54
00:01:43,261 --> 00:01:46,020
so I knew motherfuckers
scroll down to the,

55
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:46,411
all right,

56
00:01:46,411 --> 00:01:46,820
this kid,

57
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:47,653
he not,

58
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:49,470
that kid dad was David Black.

59
00:01:49,471 --> 00:01:52,950
We graduated together and I knew him
after the fact that one night he came into

60
00:01:52,951 --> 00:01:53,391
Joe married,

61
00:01:53,391 --> 00:01:54,224
it's like dog,

62
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,770
you gotta call you gotta give me a ride.

63
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:56,761
If he give me a ride,

64
00:01:56,761 --> 00:01:57,511
I'll give you a rock.

65
00:01:57,511 --> 00:01:57,721
All right.

66
00:01:57,721 --> 00:01:58,554
We gave him a ride.

67
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:00,590
He gets out of the corner of Western Yoga.

68
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,530
My three minutes later,

69
00:02:01,531 --> 00:02:04,600
he comes running back
bleeding with his head pulled.

70
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:04,861
I go,

71
00:02:04,861 --> 00:02:06,660
what happened was I went
in to rob my sister.

72
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:08,070
I mean he was serious.

73
00:02:08,071 --> 00:02:08,851
He had coke rocks,

74
00:02:08,851 --> 00:02:09,684
but everybody,

75
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:11,460
a chunk of his fucking hat,

76
00:02:11,461 --> 00:02:15,300
she caught him on the way out as he was
pulling out of the window and she just

77
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:15,511
took,

78
00:02:15,511 --> 00:02:16,344
he was bleeding.

79
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:17,663
He robbed

80
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,833
three in the morning.

81
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:26,250
You asked me for a ride.

82
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:28,590
I got to do what I gotta do
you know what I was thinking?

83
00:02:28,591 --> 00:02:29,341
How crazy.

84
00:02:29,341 --> 00:02:31,400
That's fucking crazy.

85
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:31,740
Joey.

86
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:32,760
I wish you could do your own.

87
00:02:32,761 --> 00:02:33,700
Stand by me.

88
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,280
My fucking God.

89
00:02:38,281 --> 00:02:39,770
This is who is this?

90
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:40,890
Why is this headset small?

91
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,180
When I got this picture,

92
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:43,621
which one?

93
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:44,460
The Filipino kit.

94
00:02:44,461 --> 00:02:49,350
Now this guy of left that kids like a
zillion and now his family owns a tow

95
00:02:49,351 --> 00:02:51,900
truck company in northern
New Jersey and New York City.

96
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:55,680
If you get told his family
is the one that owns it,

97
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:00,543
I swear to God,

98
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:01,541
I believe.

99
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:01,691
Yeah.

100
00:03:01,691 --> 00:03:03,130
This is fucking crazy shit,

101
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:03,821
I believe.

102
00:03:03,821 --> 00:03:04,300
Yeah,

103
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:05,140
it's fucking crazy,

104
00:03:05,141 --> 00:03:05,411
man.

105
00:03:05,411 --> 00:03:05,940
Since you know,

106
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:10,840
1970 somebody sent me this yesterday
while I was eating dinner and I almost had

107
00:03:10,841 --> 00:03:12,470
a fucking heart attack goes out.

108
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:16,090
What I found looking through your
books and that's what I was noticing.

109
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:18,610
I was smoking dope then I was no innocent.

110
00:03:18,611 --> 00:03:19,630
Then I was smoking dope.

111
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:21,530
I was finger bang and people,

112
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:23,583
like I said,

113
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:27,800
they'll be innocent and finger
back at me and my mom at the house.

114
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:28,041
Yeah,

115
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:28,181
yeah.

116
00:03:28,181 --> 00:03:28,900
I was okay.

117
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:29,471
I was okay.

118
00:03:29,471 --> 00:03:32,230
I wasn't going crazy then
why I grew up in jersey,

119
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:35,020
the PA out or is the
geared more towards boxing?

120
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:37,270
When I was in New York City,

121
00:03:37,271 --> 00:03:37,750
it was a,

122
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,790
it was a place that
they had like a boxing,

123
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:42,100
they had a pool table,

124
00:03:42,101 --> 00:03:42,881
they had a,

125
00:03:42,881 --> 00:03:44,350
you know sodas and shit like that.

126
00:03:44,351 --> 00:03:49,330
Activities you might like ceramics and
shit depending on your age and Jersey.

127
00:03:49,331 --> 00:03:50,790
It was more Mr Gameo.

128
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:54,970
Mr Gameo was a Cuban dude and he ran the
boxing program and I just knew it was

129
00:03:54,971 --> 00:03:55,511
two sons,

130
00:03:55,511 --> 00:03:56,410
Julio and season.

131
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:58,430
They got me a job at putting on the field.

132
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,021
Then they were like,

133
00:03:59,021 --> 00:03:59,320
listen,

134
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,101
when you get the job,

135
00:04:00,101 --> 00:04:03,790
you got to rub putting them fuels
right by sea caucus off of route three.

136
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:05,440
It's dirty truck.

137
00:04:05,441 --> 00:04:07,270
People go in that and job.

138
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,630
I lasted about three weeks
before they fired me,

139
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,580
but I left after three weeks.

140
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,440
The guy at night was a half a momo.

141
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,591
His name was Freddy,

142
00:04:15,591 --> 00:04:16,600
even though it's telling you this.

143
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,520
So we robbed the one that we go listen,

144
00:04:18,521 --> 00:04:19,810
we're just gonna have them be Freddy up.

145
00:04:19,811 --> 00:04:21,250
We were like sophomores in high school.

146
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:24,820
We'll put mask on me and deedee
can Tara and when he comes out,

147
00:04:24,821 --> 00:04:26,410
because in Jersey you pay the gas guy,

148
00:04:26,411 --> 00:04:27,430
you don't go into a store,

149
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:28,660
you know they pump your gas.

150
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:30,580
So if you robbed the Guy,

151
00:04:30,581 --> 00:04:32,080
you basically robbed the joint.

152
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:33,093
Do you follow me?

153
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:36,670
Only Oregon and New Jersey is
where the people pumped your gas.

154
00:04:36,671 --> 00:04:37,181
Everybody else,

155
00:04:37,181 --> 00:04:38,260
you walk in with a card.

156
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,581
So we were kids.

157
00:04:39,581 --> 00:04:39,821
We were like,

158
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:41,110
let's rob a fucked up Freddy.

159
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:42,401
You know when I worked there,

160
00:04:42,401 --> 00:04:45,250
I got to know Freddy Freddy's wife
looked like honey boo boos mother.

161
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,780
But he was a little guy.

162
00:04:46,781 --> 00:04:47,614
But he brought,

163
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:52,540
his wife was like 400 pounds and the
only way she would let him fuck him as if

164
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:55,540
he brought blow home and he was a skinny,

165
00:04:55,541 --> 00:04:57,070
tiny guy like Eddie Bravo.

166
00:04:57,070 --> 00:05:01,090
She was like three 90 and she would
actually put the Bikini and they,

167
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:02,590
they were such white trash.

168
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:05,890
They lived in a studio apartment and they
would rent the Jacuzzi and putting in

169
00:05:05,891 --> 00:05:06,724
the living room.

170
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,860
These people were fucking,

171
00:05:08,861 --> 00:05:09,910
they lived on the third floor.

172
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:11,903
Oh my God.

173
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:14,080
And it was the worst
building in the neighborhood.

174
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:15,790
And they had black Marlowe.

175
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:17,410
She was the only black
girl in the neighborhood,

176
00:05:17,411 --> 00:05:18,011
black bottle.

177
00:05:18,011 --> 00:05:19,480
I don't know what black Marlowe is today,

178
00:05:19,481 --> 00:05:21,040
but she's the Real Martin Luther King.

179
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:24,920
She was the only black girl in a white
neighborhood and Jersey girl look

180
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:25,813
torture.

181
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:26,920
She got tortured.

182
00:05:26,921 --> 00:05:27,701
I always loved black.

183
00:05:27,701 --> 00:05:28,270
Marlo.

184
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:29,310
Marlo was tight with me,

185
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:30,550
her mother was white.

186
00:05:30,551 --> 00:05:31,301
Something had happened.

187
00:05:31,301 --> 00:05:32,470
I for houses fucked up.

188
00:05:32,471 --> 00:05:33,700
That building was fucked up.

189
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,080
So I used to go with it,

190
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:35,830
selling bloat.

191
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:39,580
I remember Freddy opened up the door and
they would like a roll bar and his his

192
00:05:39,581 --> 00:05:43,240
fat wife and living with heels
with a bikini on and he's like,

193
00:05:43,241 --> 00:05:44,350
thank you for bringing it to me.

194
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,660
Like he really was like,

195
00:05:46,661 --> 00:05:47,830
when you brought him to blow,

196
00:05:47,831 --> 00:05:50,860
he was fucking thankful
that you fucking like,

197
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:51,491
thank you man.

198
00:05:51,491 --> 00:05:51,930
I'm like,

199
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:52,763
what's it tonight?

200
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:55,960
Like she would not give me my
hand job if he didn't have blow.

201
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:57,910
So finally,

202
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:01,610
so finally one day me and Deedee can tell,

203
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:02,171
we decided,

204
00:06:02,171 --> 00:06:05,300
let's go down and rob this
motherfucker on a Saturday night.

205
00:06:05,301 --> 00:06:08,360
Let's wait until about midnight when
he's got a grand on them because you,

206
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:09,240
you own dropped,

207
00:06:09,241 --> 00:06:14,030
you get 2000 so it'd be 2000 you make a
drop in the floor safe and you can't get

208
00:06:14,031 --> 00:06:14,864
back in there.

209
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:18,020
So me and Dee Dee went behind the building
by sea cock and it was right next to

210
00:06:18,021 --> 00:06:19,730
this hot dog place that be nappies.

211
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:22,760
The rumor was with that's what the ice
man killed somebody and put them in a

212
00:06:22,761 --> 00:06:24,520
tank by snapping nappies.

213
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:24,710
Not,

214
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:26,580
this is a real fucking area jersey.

215
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:30,410
This is across the street was one of the
biggest strip clubs and the east coast

216
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:31,431
not when I was there.

217
00:06:31,431 --> 00:06:31,791
Robin,

218
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:33,520
Freddy a couple of years after that,

219
00:06:33,521 --> 00:06:34,520
like the army base,

220
00:06:34,521 --> 00:06:36,530
so you remember if you lived in New York,

221
00:06:36,531 --> 00:06:39,550
they called this to the
air force base some basis,

222
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,071
some shit.

223
00:06:40,071 --> 00:06:43,470
But when we were kids we went there
like at 12 and we took Freddy down.

224
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:44,060
Doug,

225
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:46,010
we just tagged with a
master like kicking him,

226
00:06:46,011 --> 00:06:50,690
like they kicked the whatever his name
is and that Deniro movie in the bar and

227
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:51,840
we took his little person.

228
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:54,950
We ran away and he guessed
it like it took him a week.

229
00:06:54,951 --> 00:06:55,210
He's like,

230
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:58,070
you guys robbed me last night
cause we had masks on and shit.

231
00:06:58,430 --> 00:06:58,731
We're like,

232
00:06:58,731 --> 00:06:59,660
Freddy wasn't us.

233
00:06:59,661 --> 00:06:59,901
He's like,

234
00:06:59,901 --> 00:07:00,710
yes it was.

235
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:01,790
I heard your voices.

236
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:03,010
Then he came back to us.

237
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:03,291
He's like,

238
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:03,531
listen,

239
00:07:03,531 --> 00:07:05,000
I'll let your Robbie once a month,

240
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,660
but you got to split the money with me
second by an eight ball to fuck my wife.

241
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:13,790
Once a month we'd go down and get a
steady Freddy and beaten and we kicked the

242
00:07:13,791 --> 00:07:14,624
fuck out of it.

243
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:18,200
Just I'm pressing let you do it.

244
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,270
He wanted to do with the cops,

245
00:07:20,271 --> 00:07:23,450
you know that's the only way to
cops and we did it like eight times.

246
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:27,350
Give black eyes bloody noses and
some of the stomach couple of times.

247
00:07:27,351 --> 00:07:27,790
That was it.

248
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:28,330
We need them.

249
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:29,001
Neon belly,

250
00:07:29,001 --> 00:07:29,781
I don't even know what it was.

251
00:07:29,781 --> 00:07:33,590
No video back then either she
had to leave marks on him.

252
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:33,891
Yeah,

253
00:07:33,891 --> 00:07:35,240
you have like kick him a few times.

254
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,561
I couldn't do it.

255
00:07:36,561 --> 00:07:37,590
I had too much of a harsh,

256
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:38,463
I always had a higher,

257
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,520
like I had to bring like
one of my crazy friends

258
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:45,020
that was having like a bad week.

259
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:48,800
There's a kid in Miami
today that every time,

260
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:51,740
every time I place south Florida,

261
00:07:51,741 --> 00:07:55,280
he shows up with his girlfriend and he
gets fucked up and he tells a story.

262
00:07:55,281 --> 00:07:59,960
When I knocked on his door with a diagram
on how we were going to rob Freddy and

263
00:07:59,961 --> 00:08:00,261
he goes,

264
00:08:00,261 --> 00:08:02,720
that's when I knew that
you were fucking for real.

265
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:03,470
He goes,

266
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:04,970
I was eating dinner with my family.

267
00:08:04,971 --> 00:08:07,760
You can knock on the door and
had a sketch like the deal,

268
00:08:07,761 --> 00:08:11,130
how you are going to kick them and run
into the weeds and go right to the coke

269
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:11,721
dealer house.

270
00:08:11,721 --> 00:08:12,560
Like I had it planned.

271
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:13,940
We had done it so many times,

272
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:18,050
but I had to keep getting different
partners because I couldn't hit Freddie.

273
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,190
All I could do was tackle them.

274
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:22,580
I was good at tackling them and then we
want to go down and have my friend kick

275
00:08:22,581 --> 00:08:23,211
him a few times.

276
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:24,140
It was fucking horrible.

277
00:08:24,141 --> 00:08:25,940
But when you're 16 jail,

278
00:08:25,941 --> 00:08:26,721
what the fuck though?

279
00:08:26,721 --> 00:08:27,680
You've got to have a good time.

280
00:08:27,681 --> 00:08:28,514
You know

281
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:32,190
you're not going to kick study Freddy.

282
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:34,010
You're going to kick Jesus Christ

283
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:36,040
brought,

284
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:39,170
we would rob them once every
six weeks and finally it ended.

285
00:08:39,171 --> 00:08:40,220
I didn't bring up the eight ball

286
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,670
when that I just did his eight boy.

287
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:45,560
He got pissed off at me and that was it.

288
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:46,910
Shame on people.

289
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:49,520
People are just silly
when people take the time,

290
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,210
knowledge that shit or we are in,

291
00:08:52,211 --> 00:08:53,044
no I don't.

292
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:54,171
Well it's you know,

293
00:08:54,171 --> 00:08:55,380
but also no,

294
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:55,831
shut up.

295
00:08:55,831 --> 00:08:56,310
Right.

296
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:57,930
But it's also people on both ends.

297
00:08:57,931 --> 00:09:01,380
Like you choosing to get upset about
some really ridiculous should read the

298
00:09:01,381 --> 00:09:03,020
tweet and you go to that
person's page and you go,

299
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:03,863
I get it.

300
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:08,100
Once I read somebody tweet
and I go to their main page,

301
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:09,390
I get to put,

302
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:10,260
I can add it right in.

303
00:09:10,261 --> 00:09:10,770
One Minute I go,

304
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:11,310
I get it.

305
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:12,780
I get where he was coming from.

306
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:14,430
I understand why he said that.

307
00:09:14,431 --> 00:09:15,151
He's a musician.

308
00:09:15,151 --> 00:09:16,410
He's daddy's a politician.

309
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:17,640
He sells this.

310
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,340
He likes,

311
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:20,510
like today somebody hit me and I ran.

312
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,690
He was a poor riser fan.

313
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,350
I get it.

314
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:23,470
You're a fucking book.

315
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:24,270
You know what I'm saying?

316
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:25,830
I've never met a Paul Riser Fan,

317
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,610
so if you're a poor riser fan,

318
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:30,240
shoot yourself in the
fucking mouth right now.

319
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,810
Once somebody said,

320
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:37,080
if I go to some of these pains and I see
like music and I know the music sucks,

321
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:40,350
that's where it ends because
of his choice of music sucks.

322
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,020
That's what if I don't see
fucking one of my three on there,

323
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,490
like I'm going to people's that.

324
00:09:44,491 --> 00:09:46,620
There's two things I judge people.

325
00:09:46,621 --> 00:09:48,330
I don't judge people by
money and not legit people.

326
00:09:48,331 --> 00:09:49,230
That music collection,

327
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,880
by looking at your music collection,

328
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:55,660
you don't have sabbath paranoid if
you don't have the staples Zeplin too.

329
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:56,550
Those are the staples.

330
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,360
If you don't have a Zeppelin to,

331
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:59,100
why are we here?

332
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,510
Why not smoking dope with you?

333
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:03,000
Why are you wasting my fucking time?

334
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:03,781
I'm over here.

335
00:10:03,781 --> 00:10:05,720
You got like best Judy Granddad.

336
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:06,743
You know what I'm saying?

337
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,770
That's and number two,

338
00:10:07,771 --> 00:10:09,200
when you open up some
of these refrigerator,

339
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:10,140
there's certain,

340
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:10,501
yeah,

341
00:10:10,501 --> 00:10:11,220
it's true.

342
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:12,540
You opened that tells me everything.

343
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:13,560
If you're a fucking mood,

344
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:14,413
if you're a month,

345
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,070
if I see like low and beer,

346
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:16,861
your fucking money.

347
00:10:16,861 --> 00:10:17,530
I ain't never coming in.

348
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:19,090
And I knew certain people that um,

349
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:22,170
they have music laying around
just because it's cool,

350
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:23,160
but I'm tons of them.

351
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:28,160
That's why the generation
of people that want to say,

352
00:10:28,411 --> 00:10:31,410
and I know this and I don't hate
you cause I'm kind of the same way,

353
00:10:31,411 --> 00:10:34,560
that they don't want to like Floyd.

354
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:36,660
They prefer to listen to,

355
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,960
oh that's so commercialized
and some more receipt,

356
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:40,710
you know,

357
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:41,880
they make you feel bad.

358
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:44,520
The worst being that Tom Waits era.

359
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:48,780
Those mother fuckers are ones I want
to punch him right in the fucking face

360
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:51,900
because they're the ones you're having
a good time listening to something.

361
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:55,230
You're Bob and they want to like really
impressed like some fucking dumped chick

362
00:10:55,231 --> 00:10:56,250
with freckles or something.

363
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,240
Everybody's fucked already.

364
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,251
You know what I'm saying?

365
00:10:59,251 --> 00:11:00,280
Everybody fucked all you need.

366
00:11:00,281 --> 00:11:01,830
Just Tequila and the grammar blown.

367
00:11:01,831 --> 00:11:03,780
She'll be sucking your dick
and a fucking bathroom.

368
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,130
What do you want to be cool.

369
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:06,970
And the Tom waits heavy.

370
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:07,920
When's a time wait

371
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:10,980
fucking shot yourself?

372
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:11,770
Yeah,

373
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:12,770
that's good singing.

374
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:13,351
You want that?

375
00:11:13,351 --> 00:11:14,340
You're a fucking idiot.

376
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:18,480
But the only reason that people would
put that shit on is to try to overpower

377
00:11:18,481 --> 00:11:20,490
you with that fucking star wars.

378
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,353
What do you call that?

379
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,360
The fucking thing with the mind jars.

380
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:24,170
The my jam.

381
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:25,003
My tray.

382
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:26,063
That's it.

383
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:26,281
Oh,

384
00:11:26,281 --> 00:11:27,060
he's so,

385
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:27,721
oh my God.

386
00:11:27,721 --> 00:11:28,490
He likes Tom.

387
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:28,700
Wait,

388
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:29,390
listen to that.

389
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:32,530
They're trying to let me sit you
down with a gun next to yad you,

390
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:33,573
Tom.

391
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:34,763
That's good.

392
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:35,821
That's good.

393
00:11:35,821 --> 00:11:36,660
Fucking second.

394
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:37,920
That's the Beatles.

395
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:39,240
Y'All fucking shoot.

396
00:11:39,241 --> 00:11:42,160
You fucking put a gun to your fucking at.

397
00:11:42,161 --> 00:11:42,690
All right.

398
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:44,010
Telling me that's good music.

399
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:45,630
You're fucking 20 years old.

400
00:11:45,631 --> 00:11:46,320
Knock it off.

401
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,101
Like when somebody says,

402
00:11:47,101 --> 00:11:48,480
I like the Dave Matthews band.

403
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,780
I will pistol whipped.

404
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,673
You

405
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:53,520
have satellite satellite.

406
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:54,700
I'm the way up here.

407
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:57,370
She would this to me.

408
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:00,250
They would do an exodus
by bucking Bob Marley.

409
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,110
I almost cracked the fucking car.

410
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:05,770
A white dude with no shoes
on and a black new planner.

411
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,240
If fucking it's too.

412
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,500
It's too made up.

413
00:12:08,501 --> 00:12:10,150
Uncle Joey stop it.

414
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:11,800
I think he's got some good songs.

415
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:13,180
Dave has got a few good.

416
00:12:13,181 --> 00:12:13,820
So please,

417
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:14,621
you've got me emotional.

418
00:12:14,621 --> 00:12:15,470
Thank God I got together.

419
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:17,891
Fuck this shit.

420
00:12:17,891 --> 00:12:18,940
I was too quiet over there.

421
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:20,710
I hate all that shit.

422
00:12:20,711 --> 00:12:21,101
Just listen.

423
00:12:21,101 --> 00:12:21,611
You don't make it.

424
00:12:21,611 --> 00:12:22,540
Just move over.

425
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,190
I can't stay up fucking time.

426
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:27,970
And the people you like Tom Waits look
at them and go to their page and it'll

427
00:12:27,971 --> 00:12:29,020
tell you the whole thing like that.

428
00:12:29,021 --> 00:12:30,100
That something ain't right.

429
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:32,860
That vegans something there,

430
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:33,580
you know,

431
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:34,500
stop the pill.

432
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:35,291
Could pilgrims,

433
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:36,580
they care for something that you're like,

434
00:12:36,581 --> 00:12:37,300
really,

435
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:38,290
you know New Jersey,

436
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:42,580
they've been dumping shit since
the seventies sixties bro.

437
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:42,870
That,

438
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:43,030
that,

439
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:44,200
that's never going to be,

440
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:44,980
that's what's,

441
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:45,640
what's a,

442
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,340
what's that word?

443
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:47,650
RECO recognizable.

444
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,550
Reconcilable.

445
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:48,701
No.

446
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:49,241
The other word,

447
00:12:49,241 --> 00:12:50,430
when you can't reverse it,

448
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:56,630
that's soil and New Jersey's gone.

449
00:12:56,660 --> 00:13:00,550
[inaudible]

450
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:01,850
that soil in New Jersey.

451
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:03,211
I remember when that,

452
00:13:03,211 --> 00:13:04,490
when they built the metal lands,

453
00:13:04,491 --> 00:13:08,300
I remember how many animals
all of a sudden I had in
my living room because they

454
00:13:08,301 --> 00:13:09,290
tore all that down,

455
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:10,910
that wildlife and next,

456
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:11,101
you know,

457
00:13:11,101 --> 00:13:11,650
I was seeing,

458
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:16,650
I remember one night seen a possum the
size of a small people fucking treat

459
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:19,930
fucking tree.

460
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:20,763
You saw me,

461
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,430
he walked like a fucking
ate those things when,

462
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:27,070
when you call the police in Jersey,

463
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,040
I've got a possum here.

464
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:29,390
They shoot the fucking thing.

465
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:31,040
You shoot the fucking thing.

466
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:33,640
No shoot snakes in the naughty.

467
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:36,230
They shoot the fucking
possible cause they play dead.

468
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:39,100
And then when the cops leave they
fucking get up and they brushed me.

469
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:40,610
You could run over a fucking car with him.

470
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:43,760
I was running on mobile
bicycles and throw names out of,

471
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,380
they brush themselves off

472
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,530
behavioral trait.

473
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:52,160
They Dave fucking some
that's where playing possum.

474
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:52,461
Oh,

475
00:13:52,461 --> 00:13:56,180
I seen a fucking possum that looked at
me one night at like four in the morning.

476
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:57,321
I looked at him,

477
00:13:57,321 --> 00:13:57,771
I was like,

478
00:13:57,771 --> 00:13:59,120
what the fuck?

479
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:00,900
And he jumped on a treatment

480
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:08,421
and I was like,

481
00:14:08,421 --> 00:14:11,170
this is fucking mind boggling Joey.

482
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:11,951
Oh,

483
00:14:11,951 --> 00:14:12,784
it's ringing.

484
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:14,343
Check this out.

485
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:15,923
I think it's gonna work.

486
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:16,763
Yeah.

487
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:21,550
I'm not sure if he's going to answer.

488
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:27,130
You're on the radio,

489
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:31,150
I'm telling you right.

490
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:38,993
No,

491
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,790
the fucking doors over there.

492
00:14:58,010 --> 00:14:59,660
We love you too.

493
00:14:59,661 --> 00:15:00,494
Man.

494
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:04,510
Came in and just dropped a bomb.

495
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:04,990
Right?

496
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:08,760
He's the greatest fucking man.

497
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:14,690
When he shows all the fucking Michael
Irvin and those guys in front of clubs and

498
00:15:14,691 --> 00:15:19,040
he goes to Miami Dolphins use to ask the
college guys to get them into the club.

499
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:19,920
That's how,

500
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,290
that's how I watched
the trailer to the you.

501
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:24,183
What the fuck?

502
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:27,150
I was like,

503
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:27,993
sure.

504
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:33,520
It was a bunch of black gangsters or
white coach go out and be black gangs.

505
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:38,920
There's a white guy goes a black,

506
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,920
I want you to bring it back.

507
00:15:42,921 --> 00:15:44,090
I want high fives.

508
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:45,840
I want fucking change.

509
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:48,491
I want you to talk.

510
00:15:48,491 --> 00:15:50,540
Fuck not celebrate and I want everything.

511
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:53,240
I want you to fucking
humiliate these mother fuckers.

512
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:56,030
And then the guy from two live
crew came out with his hose.

513
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,370
He had a fucking VIP bags and
they will come out this week.

514
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,260
It my Dick.

515
00:16:01,261 --> 00:16:02,030
I'm hard.

516
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:04,070
And those bitches knew what time it was.

517
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:05,173
And that's all.

518
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:05,690
Listen,

519
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:08,420
there's two things that drive
black people to different levels.

520
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,250
That's when they hear two live crew.

521
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:12,170
When they go to red lobster,

522
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:15,310
black people lose their
minds at red lobster.

523
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:16,190
Fuck Popeye's.

524
00:16:16,191 --> 00:16:17,650
On Thursday you take,

525
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:22,130
you go to Sacramento Red lobster on
Friday at about four 30 when they blow the

526
00:16:22,131 --> 00:16:22,964
whistle,

527
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:24,603
blow the whistle.

528
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:25,773
It wasn't fun.

529
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:28,331
I had,

530
00:16:28,331 --> 00:16:29,660
he broke my bull.

531
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:30,720
[inaudible] was one of them.

532
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,200
Let me just tell you
the mark Babbitt story.

533
00:16:32,201 --> 00:16:35,620
Mark Babbitt went to Freddy Soto
and I'm looking for free tracks.

534
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:37,960
So Freddy came up to me at
the comedy store and he goes,

535
00:16:37,961 --> 00:16:38,794
hey man,

536
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:40,071
mark Babbitt stuff.

537
00:16:40,071 --> 00:16:40,620
A free tress.

538
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:41,453
Send them a tape.

539
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:43,360
I refuse to send the tape,

540
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:45,730
especially if I'm at the
motherfucking copy store.

541
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:46,810
Okay.

542
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:47,630
I'm not saying you know,

543
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:48,540
fucking tape.

544
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:49,210
Why is that?

545
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:50,140
I got busy shorts,

546
00:16:50,141 --> 00:16:50,771
comedy store.

547
00:16:50,771 --> 00:16:52,810
You want to tape you take a ride up here.

548
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:53,650
You want,

549
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:56,140
I'll send you a copy of
the 10 45 spots I get.

550
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,490
I ain't sending you no tape.

551
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:58,530
I just,

552
00:16:58,530 --> 00:16:59,680
I'd never said don't be a tape.

553
00:16:59,681 --> 00:17:00,430
I refused.

554
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:02,210
Especially people from La
that were calling me up again.

555
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:03,490
We're putting together a TV show.

556
00:17:03,491 --> 00:17:06,280
We need to take a loving
50th comedy stuff.

557
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:07,540
No beer.

558
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:07,871
Yeah,

559
00:17:07,871 --> 00:17:09,010
I don't fucking sending tapes.

560
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:10,091
Mark Babbitt.

561
00:17:10,091 --> 00:17:11,350
I sent him a blank tape.

562
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:16,360
I sent that jerk off finally
because the manager I had,

563
00:17:16,361 --> 00:17:17,120
Ken Phillips,

564
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,570
he kept calling me saying that
Guy Houston keeps calling you.

565
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,370
He wants you to send them a blank tape.

566
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:23,440
I fucking didn't send
them a tape for a year.

567
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:24,071
Finally,

568
00:17:24,071 --> 00:17:25,030
when dad went to fucking,

569
00:17:25,031 --> 00:17:27,300
Ralph's bought a tape
but an envelope and said,

570
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:28,930
put Joey d stand there
was done and the tape,

571
00:17:28,931 --> 00:17:32,170
you know that motherfucker call me a
week later and say love my tape and he

572
00:17:32,171 --> 00:17:33,004
hired me as a

573
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:34,510
the open for Bobby slate.

574
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,660
So fuck all you mother fuckers.

575
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:37,920
That whole tape thing

576
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,080
or booth.

577
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,630
When you go to a comedy club and
you go to his office to get paid,

578
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:43,480
he's got a TV and he's
got a thousand tapes.

579
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:44,510
I haven't with dust on them.

580
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:45,820
He don't watch those fucking things.

581
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,580
That's his fucking power booth.

582
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,140
Okay,

583
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:48,491
Sam,

584
00:17:48,491 --> 00:17:49,324
be a tape.

585
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:49,880
I came.

586
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:50,713
Do you?

587
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:53,570
You go someplace and they sign
you up and you come back to this.

588
00:17:53,571 --> 00:17:54,300
I listen.

589
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,220
You get as many minutes
as people you bring,

590
00:17:56,730 --> 00:17:57,840
you're earning your keep.

591
00:17:57,841 --> 00:18:01,170
That's one thing I rather know
where I stand and get fucked with.

592
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,580
That's the leg I'm talking about.

593
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,390
Really?

594
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:04,290
You need a tape of me.

595
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:06,120
You just saw him at the store.

596
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,600
What the fuck do you lead?

597
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,650
If I'm good enough for Mitzi shore.

598
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:12,210
Why do you want to take,

599
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:17,010
who the fuck are you and your fucking
Shit town don't want to take from me.

600
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,050
I'm not the fucking major league.

601
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:20,310
I'm fucking comedy.

602
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:21,390
The comedy store.

603
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:22,430
You call me.

604
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:24,750
You want to tape go fuck yourself.

605
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:27,080
I'm not sending you a fucking day.

606
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:29,280
It's against my fucking,

607
00:18:29,281 --> 00:18:30,114
well,

608
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:33,360
it's like these people
now with movies and TV,

609
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:33,970
Joey,

610
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:35,470
they they want you to do with Costar,

611
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:36,840
but they want you to send the real,

612
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,910
don't don't send Shit Joey,

613
00:18:38,911 --> 00:18:40,280
but they know it's a Costar.

614
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:43,410
They could offer it to me
and if they don't that fine,

615
00:18:43,411 --> 00:18:45,180
I'll do my podcasts and
I'll live another week.

616
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:47,670
That's the mind and eventually it will go.

617
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:49,710
This motherfucker isn't gonna.

618
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:50,760
We might as well give it to them.

619
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:51,810
I'm not doing it for that.

620
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,280
You want me to fucking be
a guest star recurring?

621
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:55,410
You want to give me a series regular?

622
00:18:55,411 --> 00:18:58,110
I'll give you a fucking tape and I'll
fucking to come down and talk to you.

623
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,460
But for Costar,

624
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:00,400
we've been doing this.

625
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,141
Look at the IMD.

626
00:19:01,141 --> 00:19:01,951
Be What?

627
00:19:01,951 --> 00:19:06,060
Fucking tape you decide.

628
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,710
Let me see your fucking tape.

629
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:09,840
Let me see your fucking tape.

630
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:11,080
Hey,

631
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:11,610
you said you know,

632
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:12,300
fucking tape.

633
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:14,220
Even then I had my fucking pride.

634
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:15,383
Even then,

635
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:17,300
I wouldn't send the fucking paper.

636
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:18,751
I refused.

637
00:19:18,751 --> 00:19:20,100
I finally send them a blank tape.

638
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,190
He gave me that anti never have
respect for none of them again,

639
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:25,830
because I found that it was a power play.

640
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:26,581
It was like,

641
00:19:26,581 --> 00:19:27,600
you're on my court.

642
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:27,900
Uh,

643
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:28,201
you know,

644
00:19:28,201 --> 00:19:30,420
you want to give me some
respect but respect.

645
00:19:30,421 --> 00:19:30,811
What do you do?

646
00:19:30,811 --> 00:19:31,644
You're a pimp.

647
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:34,080
You take 20% of what people
come to the fucking door.

648
00:19:34,081 --> 00:19:34,770
What the fuck are you?

649
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:35,071
One of?

650
00:19:35,071 --> 00:19:35,730
You don't,

651
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:37,200
you can't even play the fucking Ukulele.

652
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:38,490
The fuck are you doing?

653
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:41,700
You can't put a fucking Ukulele.

654
00:19:41,701 --> 00:19:42,630
What the fuck have you done?

655
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:43,880
That's my,

656
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:45,150
that's where I'm coming from.

657
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:47,570
I didn't want them to
sub club owners are bad,

658
00:19:47,571 --> 00:19:48,600
but they did great jobs.

659
00:19:48,601 --> 00:19:49,261
It was the shit.

660
00:19:49,261 --> 00:19:51,750
They bold that in fucking like,

661
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:54,060
I don't like sexual stuff
on television early.

662
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,250
He believed that girls
making their own early.

663
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:57,421
You know,

664
00:19:57,421 --> 00:20:00,240
like let's say I'm watching Diane Sawyer
and have like a condom commercial.

665
00:20:00,241 --> 00:20:01,380
I fucking lose my mind.

666
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:02,820
I of know Garcia bother you.

667
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:03,191
Oh,

668
00:20:03,191 --> 00:20:04,650
it smells a little bit on really

669
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:07,340
camp on commercial.

670
00:20:07,341 --> 00:20:09,410
I want to choke myself and
my wife is in the room.

671
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:12,380
Or like your aunt's in the
room or some older woman.

672
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:13,580
Since I was a kid,

673
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:15,230
they could a Kotex commercial.

674
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:17,260
I would sit down and look
fucking straight ahead.

675
00:20:17,261 --> 00:20:17,840
Dot.

676
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,640
I never get so embarrassed in my life.

677
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:22,820
I don't want them to ask me if I know
and I don't want to fucking know.

678
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:25,040
The blood comes out of
your snatch and what

679
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:29,600
and what you put up there.

680
00:20:29,601 --> 00:20:30,570
That's got nothing to do with me.

681
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:32,570
I'm just a little straight
that don't even bring it up.

682
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:32,990
You know,

683
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:34,230
there's some women that cute.

684
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:34,920
Yeah,

685
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,691
they think it's cute.

686
00:20:35,691 --> 00:20:35,781
Like,

687
00:20:35,781 --> 00:20:35,990
hold on,

688
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:36,351
I gotta go.

689
00:20:36,351 --> 00:20:37,170
We gotta a Tampon.

690
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:37,610
Listen,

691
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:38,443
I don't want to know.

692
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:39,800
I don't want to love you bleed.

693
00:20:39,801 --> 00:20:41,150
You just ruined everything for me.

694
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:41,720
And you know,

695
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:42,850
I don't want to know that.

696
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:43,683
That really bothered him.

697
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:44,070
I,

698
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:44,960
that bothers me.

699
00:20:44,961 --> 00:20:45,794
The sight of blood.

700
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:46,320
No,

701
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:46,470
no,

702
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:46,591
no,

703
00:20:46,591 --> 00:20:46,730
no,

704
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:46,821
no,

705
00:20:46,821 --> 00:20:47,320
no.

706
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,390
I hate the side of talking about that.

707
00:20:49,391 --> 00:20:50,980
You're fucking pussies bleeding around me.

708
00:20:50,981 --> 00:20:53,650
That's why I fucking hate when
even when they haven't that purse.

709
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,060
I got sick to my fucking stomach.

710
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:57,310
I don't want to see a
fucking tampon around.

711
00:20:57,790 --> 00:21:01,750
I don't want to fucking see a Tampon at
all or right when I'm watching TV and a

712
00:21:01,751 --> 00:21:03,040
tampon commercial comes out.

713
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:04,600
Even when I'm by myself,

714
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:05,740
I feel creepy.

715
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:08,680
That's a weird and can't
condom commercials.

716
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:12,580
That new commercial with the chicks head
popping out on the fucking thing with

717
00:21:12,581 --> 00:21:15,760
that you put on your finger to have you
seen that fucking commercial to check

718
00:21:15,761 --> 00:21:17,480
with the creepy finger to try.

719
00:21:17,481 --> 00:21:17,800
You know?

720
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,330
This is great to relieve stress.

721
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:20,051
You know what,

722
00:21:20,051 --> 00:21:20,260
man,

723
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:21,430
I don't want to know about that shit.

724
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:23,030
Play walked off.

725
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:23,873
Fuck is that?

726
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:25,850
Oh my God.

727
00:21:25,851 --> 00:21:26,684
The Zombie.

728
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:27,550
Oh my God.

729
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:27,851
Is that,

730
00:21:27,851 --> 00:21:29,890
is that a Zombie to put that away?

731
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:31,660
That's broken.

732
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:32,410
That one's broken.

733
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:33,170
That is just,

734
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:35,350
that means that even get that one fixed.

735
00:21:35,351 --> 00:21:36,011
So this day,

736
00:21:36,011 --> 00:21:37,780
anything back in those sprays?

737
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:38,800
Anything.

738
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:43,640
Badging on television like 10
o'clock drives me up a fucking wall.

739
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,880
I've never had a period problem.

740
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:46,291
Oh,

741
00:21:46,291 --> 00:21:47,124
automatic period.

742
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:48,550
Never had my own period.

743
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:48,761
Well,

744
00:21:48,761 --> 00:21:50,080
I have my own period every now and then,

745
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:53,200
but I've never had a
like a period problem,

746
00:21:53,201 --> 00:21:54,280
like a problem with the girls period.

747
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:55,720
It doesn't bother me at all.

748
00:21:55,750 --> 00:22:00,280
I told you the one I had to his day and
it was fucked up because my mother had

749
00:22:00,281 --> 00:22:03,610
just died and it was the
first time a chick called me.

750
00:22:03,611 --> 00:22:03,820
Like,

751
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:05,470
that was my first booty call ever.

752
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:07,120
I had dated this girl before.

753
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,830
She was a cheerleader at Franklin school.

754
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:11,890
I played hoops at Mckinley and we
had messed around a little bit.

755
00:22:11,891 --> 00:22:12,790
Not really Saks,

756
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:13,840
I don't remember Joe.

757
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,490
I think I sucked the titties.

758
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:16,540
I knew a brother,

759
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:17,381
you know what I'm saying?

760
00:22:17,381 --> 00:22:18,700
Like we were like in grammar school,

761
00:22:18,701 --> 00:22:22,450
high school and I had to suck to Teddy's
or something after like a dance or

762
00:22:22,451 --> 00:22:23,284
something.

763
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,490
And after my mother died,

764
00:22:24,491 --> 00:22:28,060
like I was home for a week and this lady
was taking care of me and I get this

765
00:22:28,061 --> 00:22:29,950
call one night and it's this chicken.

766
00:22:29,951 --> 00:22:30,281
She goes,

767
00:22:30,281 --> 00:22:30,491
you know,

768
00:22:30,491 --> 00:22:31,330
you want to get together?

769
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:31,860
Not,

770
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:32,800
I was feeling bad,

771
00:22:32,801 --> 00:22:33,490
you know,

772
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:33,990
I didn't know.

773
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:35,530
She's told me a little lottery pussy,

774
00:22:35,531 --> 00:22:38,590
like my little funeral pussy
and if it got funeral pussy,

775
00:22:38,591 --> 00:22:39,411
but it exists.

776
00:22:39,411 --> 00:22:40,560
You know she owned her own person.

777
00:22:40,561 --> 00:22:40,781
Yeah.

778
00:22:40,781 --> 00:22:43,660
Like after somebody dies in your family
since you're causing such a dick.

779
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:44,470
Really?

780
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:45,070
Yeah,

781
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:46,360
because they go bad like that.

782
00:22:46,361 --> 00:22:47,740
Like a maybe like a,

783
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:52,020
like a women got hang out at comedy
clubs and these iconic rupees.

784
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:52,231
Yeah.

785
00:22:52,231 --> 00:22:55,300
Like they have sex with
Pete after somebody dies.

786
00:22:55,301 --> 00:22:56,134
I'm serious.

787
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:56,973
But I knew her.

788
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:59,860
She probably just called me out of the
kindness of my heart that make me feel

789
00:22:59,861 --> 00:23:00,490
well.

790
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:05,490
So I walked from 38th street to 46 grabbed
his bitch and walked back to my house

791
00:23:05,981 --> 00:23:06,820
on 38th street.

792
00:23:06,821 --> 00:23:08,020
I'm all fucking horn up.

793
00:23:08,021 --> 00:23:08,670
We started swapping,

794
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:09,890
so I think a pants off.

795
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:15,300
I pop her panties off and the Kotex pussy
like a tongue and one of those fucking

796
00:23:15,911 --> 00:23:16,870
haunted houses.

797
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:17,853
Right.

798
00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:26,590
And I just sat there frozen.

799
00:23:26,591 --> 00:23:28,090
Like I had never seen that before.

800
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:29,770
I had never smelled that before.

801
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:31,660
I had never been around
anything like that.

802
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:32,920
My mother had just died.

803
00:23:32,921 --> 00:23:34,030
That was traumatic enough.

804
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:35,290
This was just all over.

805
00:23:35,291 --> 00:23:36,124
The fucking

806
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:39,260
woman is still alive today.

807
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:40,211
To this day.

808
00:23:40,211 --> 00:23:43,300
I don't even look on Facebook
cause I might kill her because

809
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:46,370
she fucked me up.

810
00:23:46,371 --> 00:23:47,660
Joe Rogan fucks me up.

811
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:49,490
I told him to pull up pants on.

812
00:23:49,491 --> 00:23:52,040
I remember walking home
the whole time I wanted to,

813
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:54,020
I didn't know how to control myself and

814
00:23:56,680 --> 00:24:00,620
told his dad think about that
motherfucker various because she thought,

815
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,191
I don't know.

816
00:24:01,191 --> 00:24:04,850
That's the first time I ever seen a
woman with a period and the last I made a

817
00:24:04,851 --> 00:24:05,684
fucking point.

818
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,300
That's so funny.

819
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,290
I don't care how old I am.

820
00:24:09,291 --> 00:24:10,124
If I'm in a bar,

821
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:14,060
I got a bag of coke and somewhere along
the light that chicks that she got her

822
00:24:14,061 --> 00:24:14,480
period.

823
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,270
That's where the conversation and it ends.

824
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:18,800
There's no more talking.

825
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:20,120
They used to have this freak.

826
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:23,270
They used to be this chick I used to
mess around with and Hollywood and I knew

827
00:24:23,271 --> 00:24:24,104
her cycle.

828
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:28,460
She would have a period from the 20th
to the 25th I wouldn't answer her calls.

829
00:24:28,461 --> 00:24:31,970
Those five nights dog like six or seven
nights just to make sure everything

830
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:32,620
cleared.

831
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:33,210
Wow.

832
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:35,090
She never figured it out until this day.

833
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,370
She's never forgot that
I wouldn't bring coke.

834
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:43,100
I'm gonna Waste Coke on the bloody pussy.

835
00:24:43,101 --> 00:24:43,461
Fuck it.

836
00:24:43,461 --> 00:24:44,870
I'll smell it by myself and Jack,

837
00:24:44,871 --> 00:24:45,331
but it doesn't,

838
00:24:45,331 --> 00:24:46,131
it's still feel good.

839
00:24:46,131 --> 00:24:47,480
Let's see it just the way it looks.

840
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:48,540
You don't like the way it looks.

841
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:49,870
It's more I like it.

842
00:24:52,810 --> 00:24:53,630
There's blood.

843
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:54,800
Is that bad enough for you?

844
00:24:54,801 --> 00:24:55,820
That's fucking blood.

845
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,910
It's that bad enough for you right
there that you're fucking blood.

846
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:00,560
No matter what you're doing.

847
00:25:00,561 --> 00:25:01,460
You're fucking blood.

848
00:25:01,461 --> 00:25:02,300
I know you like it.

849
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:05,730
I know red men gravy comes out.

850
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,170
I know you son of a bitch.

851
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:13,670
We never heard about like mental illness
when I was a kid I heard about like

852
00:25:13,671 --> 00:25:16,190
completely crazy people that
were locked in an asylum.

853
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:20,480
But the idea of like your aunt
taking pills because she's bipolar.

854
00:25:20,481 --> 00:25:21,380
Like what are you talking to?

855
00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:23,720
He taught her cause it was
accepted and everyone did it.

856
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:25,221
He knows like,

857
00:25:25,221 --> 00:25:25,641
Oh yeah,

858
00:25:25,641 --> 00:25:27,310
we used to take Valium and what skill?

859
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:28,520
I think it's the opposite.

860
00:25:28,521 --> 00:25:30,980
I think you just get used to
people being fucking crazy.

861
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:31,371
You know?

862
00:25:31,371 --> 00:25:32,930
You didn't feel like
you had a medicate them?

863
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:33,290
You know,

864
00:25:33,290 --> 00:25:36,620
I think people were way more crazy
in the sixties and seventies I do.

865
00:25:36,621 --> 00:25:37,454
Johnny Reid,

866
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:38,400
I tried to kill himself,

867
00:25:38,401 --> 00:25:39,570
but he jumped off a building,

868
00:25:39,571 --> 00:25:40,670
a land in the dumpster.

869
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:45,351
How bad was he?

870
00:25:45,351 --> 00:25:45,831
Broken.

871
00:25:45,831 --> 00:25:46,664
Fucked up.

872
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:52,000
He fucked up and he throws punches
into Johnny Ray was a trip.

873
00:25:52,831 --> 00:25:53,664
It was,

874
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:58,580
and he got a check from the government
and he gave it to my bartenders around

875
00:25:58,581 --> 00:25:59,270
the first.

876
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:00,290
That's what people thought.

877
00:26:00,291 --> 00:26:01,030
But he lived like,

878
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:01,821
he banged his head.

879
00:26:01,821 --> 00:26:04,120
I'm a dumpster fucking over the dog.

880
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:07,430
He lived and he gives his check from
the government on the first to the

881
00:26:07,431 --> 00:26:09,980
bartender and he tore the bartender to,

882
00:26:09,981 --> 00:26:13,160
that check was done and they'd throw him
out for the first and they will last a

883
00:26:13,161 --> 00:26:16,020
little about the 18th and
19th when I was a kid,

884
00:26:16,021 --> 00:26:16,431
I used to tour,

885
00:26:16,431 --> 00:26:17,310
met Johnny Ray.

886
00:26:17,311 --> 00:26:19,310
He goes through on the east coast.

887
00:26:19,311 --> 00:26:20,330
You'd locked the bathroom from the,

888
00:26:20,331 --> 00:26:21,164
yeah,

889
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:22,670
collected.

890
00:26:22,670 --> 00:26:22,961
Lucky.

891
00:26:22,961 --> 00:26:26,110
So you liked the baptists of
the outside of the east coast.

892
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,240
When you leave a bar at night,

893
00:26:28,241 --> 00:26:29,660
when they close up right.

894
00:26:30,010 --> 00:26:31,750
They locked the bathroom
and then they put like a,

895
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,540
a lock or if you break in,

896
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:33,911
they can't,

897
00:26:33,911 --> 00:26:34,960
he would go in the bathroom.

898
00:26:34,961 --> 00:26:36,730
Johnny read like 11
o'clock in the morning,

899
00:26:36,731 --> 00:26:37,920
the P and we locked him in there.

900
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:39,820
We leave them in there until
like six o'clock at night.

901
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:41,650
We come back to have a drink.

902
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:44,130
We'd open the bathroom and
he'd come out like nothing.

903
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:44,791
I swear to God,

904
00:26:44,791 --> 00:26:45,690
like nothing happened.

905
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:47,430
He was hilarious.

906
00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:50,460
One day I put my Dick
on a chair next to him.

907
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:54,280
He was sitting at a Boston,

908
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:54,841
my friends like,

909
00:26:54,841 --> 00:26:55,674
put your Dick,

910
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:57,090
see what happens.

911
00:26:57,091 --> 00:26:57,630
And he's like,

912
00:26:57,630 --> 00:26:58,200
wow.

913
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:01,170
And he just got up though Johnny relived.

914
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:02,790
It's like maybe 12 years ago,

915
00:27:02,791 --> 00:27:06,390
we used to give him bumps a coke and get
them riled up at the bar and they just

916
00:27:06,391 --> 00:27:06,661
leave.

917
00:27:06,661 --> 00:27:07,660
Fuck you motherfuckers.

918
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:08,450
I'll fight Ali.

919
00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:10,710
Is that he just fucking
leave for that reason anyway.

920
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:11,671
Did you,

921
00:27:11,671 --> 00:27:12,320
uh,

922
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,280
Jennifer have a great
data to kill herself?

923
00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:16,363
No.

924
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:17,453
They should've

925
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:22,260
put that fucking helmet committee.

926
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:23,130
Your fucking Dick.

927
00:27:23,131 --> 00:27:24,810
And yet he should kill yourself.

928
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:27,060
Kill yourself the first time.

929
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:29,010
And when you get to your destination.

930
00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:33,680
I think when I needed the drugs,

931
00:27:33,681 --> 00:27:37,970
he was one of my whole body was in
pain and it's not pain that you feel.

932
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:40,430
It's just this pain and it was awesome.

933
00:27:40,431 --> 00:27:41,480
You did it for so long.

934
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:43,390
Your body became accustomed
to using beginning.

935
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:44,210
But in the beginning,

936
00:27:44,210 --> 00:27:45,860
why is the main reason we get down?

937
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:50,030
Why is the main reason that guy like
you and lose you have pain in your life

938
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:50,511
growing up?

939
00:27:50,511 --> 00:27:51,344
We all do.

940
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,870
What made you different than not doing it?

941
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:54,711
You know,

942
00:27:54,711 --> 00:27:55,161
when you,

943
00:27:55,161 --> 00:27:55,970
uh,

944
00:27:55,970 --> 00:27:57,410
when you first get involved in that,

945
00:27:57,470 --> 00:27:58,640
your body hurts.

946
00:27:58,641 --> 00:27:59,450
Man,

947
00:27:59,450 --> 00:27:59,981
I can't imagine.

948
00:27:59,981 --> 00:28:00,140
You know,

949
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:01,340
when I was 17,

950
00:28:01,341 --> 00:28:05,370
I go home at the end of the
night when I was in school,

951
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:06,800
I had to go to school at seven 30.

952
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:08,180
It's not going high school.

953
00:28:08,181 --> 00:28:08,601
Junior.

954
00:28:08,601 --> 00:28:11,780
I had to go to school and I would come
home and sit in the corner in the dark

955
00:28:11,781 --> 00:28:16,781
with headphones on with an eight track
black sabbath and I just do coke two or

956
00:28:17,131 --> 00:28:17,780
three in the morning.

957
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:18,081
He says,

958
00:28:18,081 --> 00:28:18,740
Christ,

959
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:20,120
no drinking just to cope.

960
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,370
What possesses you do that,

961
00:28:22,371 --> 00:28:22,851
Joe Rogan?

962
00:28:22,851 --> 00:28:23,300
I Dunno.

963
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:23,571
What's it,

964
00:28:23,571 --> 00:28:24,401
cause that was a junkie.

965
00:28:24,401 --> 00:28:24,581
No,

966
00:28:24,581 --> 00:28:25,400
I was,

967
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:25,970
you know what?

968
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:28,770
I was in so much pain what it,

969
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:32,570
but pain covers this huge
thing when you're doing drugs.

970
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:34,350
Pain could be uh,

971
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:36,590
you know,

972
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:39,380
fucking confusion.

973
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,260
Pain shows up as confusion.

974
00:28:42,261 --> 00:28:44,480
Confusion shows up as pain
is what I'm saying to you.

975
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:45,080
Confused.

976
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,220
So I was 16.

977
00:28:46,221 --> 00:28:47,330
It could be emotional pain,

978
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,130
it could be a launch,

979
00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:49,240
doesn't have to be physical.

980
00:28:49,241 --> 00:28:50,780
Whole body's in pain and you're doing it.

981
00:28:50,781 --> 00:28:51,021
You know,

982
00:28:51,021 --> 00:28:52,910
I talked to the head that
totally could kid I kidnapped,

983
00:28:53,570 --> 00:28:53,790
you know,

984
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:54,980
I call them a lot now.

985
00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:55,640
Wow.

986
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:56,001
Guilty.

987
00:28:56,001 --> 00:28:59,180
I'm really fucking guilty of that because
I saw something when I get knocked him

988
00:28:59,181 --> 00:29:00,950
that it's not Joe Diaz.

989
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:02,030
I saw him suffering.

990
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:04,160
I saw him at one moment on the floor,

991
00:29:04,161 --> 00:29:06,710
handcuffed and I would
never want that to me.

992
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:07,251
You know what I'm saying?

993
00:29:07,251 --> 00:29:09,980
Like I always dreaded that happens
to a friend of mine for what I did.

994
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:11,510
And I always felt bad.

995
00:29:11,511 --> 00:29:15,620
I had call on the podcast and I apologized
to him and I always call him up and I

996
00:29:15,621 --> 00:29:17,600
called him the other day and we
were talking and they told me,

997
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:18,110
you know,

998
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:18,980
every time I talked to him,

999
00:29:18,981 --> 00:29:20,270
he tells me more about his life,

1000
00:29:20,271 --> 00:29:20,990
Bro.

1001
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:22,850
You know what happened
since I kidnapped him.

1002
00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:24,710
I bumped into him in [inaudible] 94.

1003
00:29:24,711 --> 00:29:25,970
I kidnapped them and 87,

1004
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:28,550
I bumped into him in [inaudible]
94 and I bought coke from him.

1005
00:29:29,630 --> 00:29:30,860
He was all fucked up at,

1006
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:31,700
at uh,

1007
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:33,710
at Pearl Street down in boulder.

1008
00:29:34,010 --> 00:29:35,090
And then he never remembered.

1009
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,080
I think he blacked out.

1010
00:29:36,081 --> 00:29:37,250
That's how bad a shape he was.

1011
00:29:37,251 --> 00:29:38,084
And I asked him,

1012
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:39,710
but last but not this time,

1013
00:29:39,711 --> 00:29:40,850
but the time before I asked him,

1014
00:29:40,851 --> 00:29:42,370
do you me buying blow from you?

1015
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:42,980
He goes,

1016
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:43,840
I remember seeing it.

1017
00:29:43,841 --> 00:29:46,420
I remember hating you
the next day to leave.

1018
00:29:46,421 --> 00:29:49,120
I didn't knock you the fuck out
because I caught him off guard.

1019
00:29:49,121 --> 00:29:50,350
He was at a bar all fucked up.

1020
00:29:50,351 --> 00:29:51,560
I got saw me some blowers.

1021
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,540
I look Hosea,

1022
00:29:52,810 --> 00:29:53,950
the guy who kidnap me,

1023
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:55,720
the guy who could that mean,

1024
00:29:56,200 --> 00:30:00,100
but I called him blow after him after you
kidnapped him and before you apologize

1025
00:30:00,101 --> 00:30:00,531
for kidnap.

1026
00:30:00,531 --> 00:30:02,080
And actually the way
that you guys all met,

1027
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:04,180
I saw him at a bomb pro street.

1028
00:30:04,181 --> 00:30:04,811
Did you even say,

1029
00:30:04,811 --> 00:30:05,770
I'm sorry I kidnapped you.

1030
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:06,623
Not that night.

1031
00:30:07,130 --> 00:30:10,810
I just gave him a hug and asked him if
he knew where it gets him blow his shit.

1032
00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:12,430
Not that night.

1033
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:14,530
Gave me a hug and I always
go to the bottom of one.

1034
00:30:14,531 --> 00:30:15,281
I apologize.

1035
00:30:15,281 --> 00:30:16,120
That felt really bad.

1036
00:30:16,121 --> 00:30:16,691
And I talked to him,

1037
00:30:16,691 --> 00:30:20,560
he had Danny and he started telling
me he's 50 he moves with his mother.

1038
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,060
He had a heart attack.

1039
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:23,471
You know,

1040
00:30:23,471 --> 00:30:26,290
I could tell when I talked to him and in
his pictures on Facebook that he had a

1041
00:30:26,291 --> 00:30:27,124
stroke,

1042
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:28,240
you know,

1043
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,410
that was often the blow bro.

1044
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:31,720
Sometimes when he calls me and
I could tell he's drinking,

1045
00:30:32,050 --> 00:30:32,883
you know,

1046
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,840
and sometimes I feel real guilty,

1047
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:35,711
did I do this?

1048
00:30:35,711 --> 00:30:36,640
But then you know,

1049
00:30:36,641 --> 00:30:37,271
I'm the type of guy,

1050
00:30:37,271 --> 00:30:38,140
I don't play that shit.

1051
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:38,620
You know,

1052
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:39,700
I don't play that shit at all.

1053
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:41,290
He was fucked up when
I get in that though,

1054
00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:44,860
a couple of weeks before,

1055
00:30:44,861 --> 00:30:45,071
you know,

1056
00:30:45,071 --> 00:30:48,880
how are we got how this whole thing
started was because he got a Dui fucked up

1057
00:30:48,881 --> 00:30:49,714
some cars,

1058
00:30:49,810 --> 00:30:51,100
went to bold the hospital.

1059
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,300
I'm on North Hospital,

1060
00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:53,163
boulder general,

1061
00:30:53,530 --> 00:30:54,341
and while he was in there,

1062
00:30:54,341 --> 00:30:54,611
you know,

1063
00:30:54,611 --> 00:30:55,390
boulder,

1064
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:55,961
he was hurt.

1065
00:30:55,961 --> 00:30:57,850
They left them in a room by
himself and he stole a bottle,

1066
00:30:57,851 --> 00:30:59,320
liquid coke cans and
jumped out the window.

1067
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:00,650
Okay.

1068
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:02,860
And they call them and I will lay
down the other side of the bulb.

1069
00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:05,350
You steal a bottle of liquid
cocaine from the hospital.

1070
00:31:05,351 --> 00:31:06,184
You already got prom.

1071
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,410
Oh my God.

1072
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:08,140
Kidnapping Him.

1073
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:08,381
You know?

1074
00:31:08,381 --> 00:31:09,550
And we laugh and we giggle.

1075
00:31:09,551 --> 00:31:10,500
Me Kidnapping Him.

1076
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:11,830
It makes me feel blank.

1077
00:31:11,831 --> 00:31:13,030
Maybe I contribute to that,

1078
00:31:13,031 --> 00:31:13,570
but I didn't.

1079
00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:15,370
He had his own doom.

1080
00:31:15,371 --> 00:31:16,540
Why didn't I get fucked up?

1081
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:17,230
You know?

1082
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:17,471
I mean,

1083
00:31:17,471 --> 00:31:18,161
I got fucked up,

1084
00:31:18,161 --> 00:31:18,911
but in different ways,

1085
00:31:18,911 --> 00:31:22,720
I paid in different ways because the
guilt in me doing that to a man fucking

1086
00:31:22,721 --> 00:31:23,554
destroyed me.

1087
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:24,460
You know?

1088
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:25,450
I like to fuck around.

1089
00:31:25,451 --> 00:31:25,631
You know?

1090
00:31:25,631 --> 00:31:27,910
I could do something bad
if somebody harms me.

1091
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:29,320
But even with Jujitsu,

1092
00:31:29,321 --> 00:31:31,570
I just can't put my form
and some of these face,

1093
00:31:31,571 --> 00:31:31,840
man,

1094
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,400
I hate when I have to lay on somebody.

1095
00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:34,690
Like I'll check on him and got you.

1096
00:31:34,691 --> 00:31:35,201
Okay Bro.

1097
00:31:35,201 --> 00:31:36,190
You know I love you right now.

1098
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,241
I would look at me.

1099
00:31:37,241 --> 00:31:38,074
Do I know?

1100
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:39,491
You know,

1101
00:31:39,491 --> 00:31:39,941
it's funny.

1102
00:31:39,941 --> 00:31:41,170
So for me,

1103
00:31:41,171 --> 00:31:42,060
seeing him in that corner,

1104
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:44,050
I always had that guilt
that I tied him up.

1105
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:51,740
[inaudible]

1106
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:54,270
okay.
