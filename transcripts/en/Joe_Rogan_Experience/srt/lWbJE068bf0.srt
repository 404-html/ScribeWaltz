1
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:03,850
Hello Freak bitches,
two or three stories.

2
00:00:03,851 --> 00:00:06,670
And so you set up a perimeter around the
building.

3
00:00:06,671 --> 00:00:08,460
Key people stationed in them.
Yup.

4
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:11,050
Uh,
guns at the windows looking out

5
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:12,520
constantly.
And it would be,

6
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:17,740
we take the building down and then they
would do a massive construction projects

7
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:19,870
in the middle of a combat zone.
So these army engineers,

8
00:00:19,871 --> 00:00:24,700
God bless them all would roll down there
with their bulldozers and there they'd

9
00:00:24,701 --> 00:00:28,570
put these big concrete barriers up and
they put sand bags and all the windows

10
00:00:28,571 --> 00:00:30,850
and they build machine gun nests on top.
And again,

11
00:00:30,851 --> 00:00:33,130
they're doing this in the middle of like
mayhem.

12
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:36,370
Wow.
And then you'd have this secure combat

13
00:00:36,371 --> 00:00:38,080
outpost.
And while they were doing that,

14
00:00:38,081 --> 00:00:42,460
this is sort of was our,
our addition to this type of operation

15
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:45,790
was while they were doing this big
construction progress project,

16
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:49,480
obviously the situation was very
vulnerable for the American forces.

17
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:54,780
And so what we would do is I would push
our seals out into perimeter buildings

18
00:00:56,981 --> 00:01:01,120
that were maybe a 200 or 300 yards away.
And so when the enemy would come to

19
00:01:01,121 --> 00:01:02,800
attack,
we'd kill them.

20
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,510
What a crazy scene that must've been to
be taking these buildings and then

21
00:01:07,511 --> 00:01:11,800
reinforcing them and turning them into
military bases and then one after

22
00:01:11,801 --> 00:01:13,150
another as you're doing this too.
Yeah.

23
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,111
Yeah,
it was,

24
00:01:14,111 --> 00:01:16,270
it was an awesome effort and I think a
good number.

25
00:01:16,271 --> 00:01:18,970
We put in one combat outpost and there
was the,

26
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:23,650
the uh,
army engineers put in 30,000 sandbags in

27
00:01:23,651 --> 00:01:26,050
one combat outpost,
three buildings.

28
00:01:26,051 --> 00:01:28,180
Just all good things.
A lot of sand out there.

29
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:29,043
Yeah,
no doubt.

30
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:30,940
No doubt about it.
Wow.

31
00:01:30,941 --> 00:01:34,090
And so how many buildings did you guys
wind up taking overall?

32
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:37,530
Uh,
totally.

33
00:01:37,531 --> 00:01:40,170
It probably a total of like 10 combat
outposts.

34
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,630
Each one having two,
three or four buildings.

35
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,970
And again,
let me clarify when I say we,

36
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:48,720
I'm talking about this massive effort of
the one one aed,

37
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,250
which is the,
the First Brigade,

38
00:01:50,251 --> 00:01:54,810
First Armored Division and all the
battalions that were underneath them,

39
00:01:54,811 --> 00:01:58,230
including one a Marine Corps battalion.
And the reason I'm pointing that out,

40
00:01:58,231 --> 00:01:58,630
Joe,
is,

41
00:01:58,630 --> 00:01:59,463
um,

42
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:04,540
those guys were just unbelievable us.
They were like war.

43
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,450
They were awesome.
You choked up.

44
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:09,933
Okay.

45
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:11,420
Yeah,
these guys were,

46
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:14,450
these guys were awesome.
They really were.

47
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,580
Yeah.
I can only imagine the emotional

48
00:02:20,581 --> 00:02:22,290
attachment that you have to that.

49
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,010
Yeah.
And you know,

50
00:02:28,011 --> 00:02:28,500
they,
you know,

51
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,640
you can look,
you can google navy seals and find,

52
00:02:31,641 --> 00:02:34,700
you know,
20 million new stories about them.

53
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,210
Um,
and that's great.

54
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,030
But these guys,
you know,

55
00:02:41,031 --> 00:02:43,940
to,
to have seen them,

56
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:46,700
uh,
kids,

57
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:48,500
you know,
because you know,

58
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:51,620
you're talking about earlier how the
seals,

59
00:02:51,621 --> 00:02:52,700
you know,
guys like me,

60
00:02:52,701 --> 00:02:54,710
this isn't what we want to do.
Well,

61
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,790
these guys didn't all necessarily have
that attitude.

62
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:02,590
And as a matter of fact,
the guys that were in Ramadi with us

63
00:03:02,591 --> 00:03:06,190
when we first got there,
they were reserve unit out of

64
00:03:06,191 --> 00:03:08,830
Pennsylvania,
the two to eight iron soldiers.

65
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:10,930
They were reservists.
These guys were teachers that like,

66
00:03:10,931 --> 00:03:13,420
like what you see when they talk about
these reserves.

67
00:03:13,421 --> 00:03:16,800
These guys were teachers and professors
and you know,

68
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,020
bakers and they had real jobs and real
world and wanting to get home to their

69
00:03:20,021 --> 00:03:20,801
family.
And yet they were,

70
00:03:20,801 --> 00:03:23,440
they're grinding it out against a
hardened enemy.

71
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:24,820
And so,
uh,

72
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:26,283
yeah,
it's,

73
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:27,311
it's a,
it's a,

74
00:03:27,311 --> 00:03:32,311
it's a crazy thing to see and it's,
it's very humbling to be around people

75
00:03:33,071 --> 00:03:34,780
like that.
It really is.

76
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:36,960
That was one of the things I would have
a hard time coach Halter fighter.

77
00:03:36,961 --> 00:03:38,240
Cause I'll,
I'll look at our,

78
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:39,660
you know,
dissected person.

79
00:03:39,661 --> 00:03:41,100
I'm like in about,
Kay,

80
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:43,860
let me see you fight me.
I'm going to go with you and I'm okay.

81
00:03:43,861 --> 00:03:45,090
You have a hole here,
a hole here.

82
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:48,510
So are you looking just to fight to make
two paychecks,

83
00:03:48,511 --> 00:03:52,890
three paychecks if cell then I guess
you're in the right area.

84
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:54,990
But if you're looking to be a real
champion,

85
00:03:54,991 --> 00:03:56,850
if you're looking to be able to provide
for your family,

86
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:59,790
I mean I always thought we all,
all the time when I was in the UFC,

87
00:03:59,791 --> 00:04:01,890
when that fought for the world
championship at one 35,

88
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:03,970
I also,
we're going to fucking full time job and

89
00:04:03,971 --> 00:04:05,610
they'll be like,
do it fight for world championship.

90
00:04:05,611 --> 00:04:06,660
You shouldn't be working.
I was like,

91
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:10,080
uh,
yeah because what have you,

92
00:04:10,081 --> 00:04:10,950
I've lost the fight.

93
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:13,080
So now I,
I made what,

94
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:17,790
$14,000 because that what she made to
fight for the world title at one 35.

95
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:18,420
Yes.
That's,

96
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:18,801
well,
it's,

97
00:04:18,801 --> 00:04:19,830
it's,
it's all public record.

98
00:04:19,831 --> 00:04:22,470
So God damn,
and then that's why it's depressing.

99
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:25,940
So that's why I was still working.
Even when I fight in Modo,

100
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:27,630
I mean,
I made my money then I was like,

101
00:04:27,631 --> 00:04:30,600
Kate,
every single thing I had in ufc up to

102
00:04:30,601 --> 00:04:32,340
the dominant Cruz spite,
Eh,

103
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,070
when I brought them on,
they going to go towards,

104
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,180
I was like,
I was in Vegas.

105
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:37,860
It was almost like a vacation for me.
You know,

106
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,720
when Dana,
when Matt will call me,

107
00:04:39,721 --> 00:04:40,554
he goes,
hey,

108
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:42,060
the UFC wants to know who want to fight.
Uh,

109
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:42,953
Katie,
I'm going where I was like,

110
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,560
I'll be like,
uh,

111
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,600
can I call you right back?
I need to call work to see if I could

112
00:04:46,601 --> 00:04:47,520
stay off please.

113
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,180
And I will call my boss people hockey
now.

114
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:51,083
Hey,
um,

115
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:52,740
so ufc called,
they want to know is your job,

116
00:04:52,741 --> 00:04:55,850
what were you doing?
Farming or working at a paper mill and

117
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:56,880
construction.
So we built,

118
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,620
uh,
basically sonic tubes.

119
00:04:58,830 --> 00:04:59,880
So,
um,

120
00:04:59,881 --> 00:05:02,280
and we also built the board.
So at this uh,

121
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:04,740
microphone came to you and it was in
protection.

122
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,980
It would be like a V board that would
protect it.

123
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,260
And that's where I was the guy who made
it.

124
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,420
And let's say you needed two and a half
inches or three inches,

125
00:05:12,421 --> 00:05:13,201
four inches,
five inches,

126
00:05:13,201 --> 00:05:14,790
whatever.
I would take it,

127
00:05:14,791 --> 00:05:17,370
do the math,
put it in the computer and sit there and

128
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:18,600
go to g,
G,

129
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,730
G and I'll go one,
two,

130
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:22,170
three,
four.

131
00:05:22,171 --> 00:05:24,930
Okay.
Those 10 there you go and do that all

132
00:05:24,931 --> 00:05:25,591
day.
And then when I,

133
00:05:25,591 --> 00:05:27,210
and not have my phone on me and that
will call me those,

134
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:28,950
hey doc once,
so if you want to fight,

135
00:05:28,951 --> 00:05:31,170
and I'm like,
I'll run into the bathroom and like,

136
00:05:31,171 --> 00:05:31,770
Hey,
what's up man?

137
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:32,430
He goes,
hey,

138
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:34,000
you know,
you usually want you to fight Kevin Modo

139
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:37,560
on February 5th,
my debut in UFC 211 I'll say,

140
00:05:37,561 --> 00:05:38,880
hey,
let me see if I get a day off from work.

141
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,620
I go into my office,
they now say,

142
00:05:40,621 --> 00:05:42,060
hey pete,
what's going on?

143
00:05:42,061 --> 00:05:42,751
And he goes,
what's up DJ?

144
00:05:42,751 --> 00:05:43,584
And I'm like,
Hey,

145
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:46,170
do you think I can have a week off to go
fight in a vegas?

146
00:05:46,171 --> 00:05:47,520
He goes,
uh,

147
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,020
yeah,
let me see if I can work it out.

148
00:05:49,021 --> 00:05:49,831
And then I'm like,
all right,

149
00:05:49,831 --> 00:05:50,551
no,
not come out as,

150
00:05:50,551 --> 00:05:51,384
hey,
I don't know.

151
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:52,320
Don't say yes.
I don't know.

152
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:53,550
I don't know yet.
Okay.

153
00:05:53,551 --> 00:05:54,520
And he goes,
all right,

154
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:55,380
we'll just let me know.
Okay.

155
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,760
And then sure enough in barstow.
So yeah,

156
00:05:56,761 --> 00:05:57,740
you get a week off.
And I was like,

157
00:05:57,741 --> 00:05:58,401
Hey,
I can go.

158
00:05:58,401 --> 00:05:58,821
And he goes,
all right,

159
00:05:58,821 --> 00:06:00,110
I'll let sean shelby know you can fight.

160
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:02,540
That's how it was.
Are you still friends with your boss?

161
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:03,351
Yeah.
Yeah.

162
00:06:03,351 --> 00:06:04,820
We still hang out with you.
Happy.

163
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,040
Oh yeah,
he's now,

164
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:06,681
well,
he said,

165
00:06:06,681 --> 00:06:10,670
he said he would fire me before I quit
fighting and doing her old job because

166
00:06:10,671 --> 00:06:12,830
in reality that's what's pay my fucking
bills.

167
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:15,800
That check was coming every single week.
It was keeping the lights on.

168
00:06:15,801 --> 00:06:18,170
Fighting was not,
so that's why I tell kids all the time,

169
00:06:18,171 --> 00:06:18,441
like,
man,

170
00:06:18,441 --> 00:06:19,280
it would be just like it.
I was like,

171
00:06:19,281 --> 00:06:20,380
no,
my friend be better than he.

172
00:06:20,381 --> 00:06:21,710
Go to college,
get education.

173
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:25,760
Don't try to put yourself in a,
in a boat to where this all you have to

174
00:06:25,761 --> 00:06:26,690
do.
You you have,

175
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,800
you know,
now it's worked out for me where I can,

176
00:06:28,801 --> 00:06:29,960
I'm starting to,
you know,

177
00:06:29,961 --> 00:06:33,470
branch out and they try to do other
things but that's how the reality was.

178
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:36,230
And so that's why I worked for time.
The dirtiness,

179
00:06:36,231 --> 00:06:38,090
the humiliation.
No.

180
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:49,940
What are we gonna wrap this up
so fucked up.

181
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:54,430
You shouldn't be talking to on the air.
Listen,

182
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:57,110
nothing bad has been sad.
Beautiful.

183
00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:00,650
Talking about aerial is I love dark
ones.

184
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:01,340
No,
no,

185
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:02,173
no.
I like,

186
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:02,871
uh,
I like,

187
00:07:02,871 --> 00:07:05,720
my wife is like a high pink.
I like that.

188
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:08,510
Okay.
It seems real.

189
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:11,210
I wasn't real.
I don't want to go on the Strip club and

190
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:13,130
have them be able to get naked like
that.

191
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:16,760
I want them to like take nervous about,
oh what the realness.

192
00:07:16,761 --> 00:07:19,010
I want to see like let's talk marks in
their leg.

193
00:07:19,011 --> 00:07:19,880
Realness.
Oh,

194
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,490
sophomores.
Like I want real,

195
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:24,650
let's wrap this bitch up cause this is
going to go south.

196
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:27,920
Suck marks.
I just got back from Columbus,

197
00:07:27,921 --> 00:07:30,200
Ohio and you're not allowed to be naked
there.

198
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:33,920
And so all the girls had pastries,
but they would have like darker nipple

199
00:07:33,921 --> 00:07:34,820
looking pasty.

200
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:37,120
So it looked like they all just have
really big area,

201
00:07:37,121 --> 00:07:39,320
all that dark Ariel and now it was
ridiculous.

202
00:07:39,321 --> 00:07:43,880
You have to have a thin rubber sheet
over the outside of your nipple and if

203
00:07:43,881 --> 00:07:46,760
you go outside you can just take her
shirt off cause it's legal and Columbus,

204
00:07:46,761 --> 00:07:48,680
Ohio to just take your shirt off
outside.

205
00:07:48,681 --> 00:07:50,390
But when you're inside at the Strip
club,

206
00:07:50,391 --> 00:07:52,100
you have to put paste.
These are in Columbus.

207
00:07:52,101 --> 00:07:53,650
It's legal to be topless.
If you're white,

208
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:56,720
it's been there for forever.
You can just walk around with,

209
00:07:56,721 --> 00:07:58,040
no,
it's hilarious.

210
00:07:58,041 --> 00:07:59,360
What a dumb business.
Hey,

211
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,630
are you upset at all?
The freedom that you have with girl's

212
00:08:02,631 --> 00:08:05,210
nipples out there on the street will
come on inside.

213
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:09,020
Come on and shout.
We'll show you a watered down version of

214
00:08:09,021 --> 00:08:12,070
what's available right outside our door.
We'll judge you.

215
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,970
Chrissy teagan's,
a nipple warrior.

216
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:15,450
Who's that?
I don't know.

217
00:08:15,451 --> 00:08:17,120
I just read it the other way.
She's a nipple warrior.

218
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:23,500
I don't even know the Fuck Debbie Morris
kids in Nipple Warrior,

219
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:26,030
the Nipple Warriors.
What does that mean?

220
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:27,710
They're like,
they want everyone to be able to see

221
00:08:27,711 --> 00:08:28,610
their nipples.
Oh,

222
00:08:28,611 --> 00:08:29,510
okay.
Okay.

223
00:08:29,511 --> 00:08:31,850
Like I'll really sheer shirt or
something like that.

224
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:32,131
No,
no,

225
00:08:32,131 --> 00:08:32,441
no,
no,

226
00:08:32,441 --> 00:08:33,080
no,
no.

227
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:37,160
They want to go
do Demi Moore's kid.

228
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,250
She just walks around shirtless.
Barb,

229
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,330
you gotta be like 20 or something.
You're talking about Jay Leno.

230
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:45,620
I know.
Yeah,

231
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:46,061
yeah,
yeah,

232
00:08:46,061 --> 00:08:47,550
yeah.
Something.

233
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:50,090
One of the names riders had rain or
something.

234
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:53,870
Rickles recalls what it fucking,
what are the more kids?

235
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,150
The more time Roger Moore,
whatever it's fucking on.

236
00:08:56,170 --> 00:09:00,130
You're getting more and more.
Demi Moore is fucking Joe.

237
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:03,150
What about like five minutes now?
Her name is rumor,

238
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,620
rumor,
more type and river.

239
00:09:04,621 --> 00:09:06,390
More uh,

240
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,380
Dove.
Jay Leno.

241
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:08,370
He's a little kid alone.
No,

242
00:09:08,371 --> 00:09:11,050
it's a fucking grown up.
It's a real grownup type.

243
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:14,580
The goddamn
fucking nipple.

244
00:09:14,581 --> 00:09:17,100
Rubber Nipple.
Yeah.

245
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:19,870
That's rap.
James Burke Christ.

246
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:20,730
Your Ladies and gentlemen.
