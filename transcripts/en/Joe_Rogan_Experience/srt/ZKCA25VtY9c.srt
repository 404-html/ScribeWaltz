1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,620
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:03,000
They like described Brendan Schaub.

3
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:03,211
Oh,

4
00:00:03,211 --> 00:00:04,044
the lips.

5
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:05,761
He's big lift.

6
00:00:05,761 --> 00:00:07,080
I describe his big brown.

7
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:07,831
That's medium.

8
00:00:07,831 --> 00:00:09,560
Got On and on Twitter
trying to get his name.

9
00:00:09,561 --> 00:00:11,750
I'm trying to get his nickname
change from hybrid to big Brown.

10
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:12,780
This guy starts with big,

11
00:00:12,781 --> 00:00:13,111
broad,

12
00:00:13,111 --> 00:00:13,944
big brown.

13
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:14,881
He's big brown.

14
00:00:14,881 --> 00:00:15,780
He's just big and Brown.

15
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:17,700
That's why everybody
calls him big brown bats.

16
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,740
It's weird when you see someone come home,

17
00:00:19,741 --> 00:00:20,281
your Stepdad,

18
00:00:20,281 --> 00:00:20,511
Gus,

19
00:00:20,511 --> 00:00:21,440
it's got our lock.

20
00:00:21,441 --> 00:00:22,274
I want,

21
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,233
what

22
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:27,690
if I was breaded sharp?

23
00:00:27,691 --> 00:00:28,590
It'd be like for sure.

24
00:00:28,591 --> 00:00:31,470
Keep your hands up next time for sure.

25
00:00:31,471 --> 00:00:32,940
Don't let them get that close to you.

26
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:34,830
Talk my shit to each other.

27
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:38,670
They get in a fight when I
was 12 I'm not making this up.

28
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:40,350
Whatever.

29
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:41,880
Fucking cars.

30
00:00:41,881 --> 00:00:42,480
Right.

31
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,860
My Dad pulls in front of them.

32
00:00:43,861 --> 00:00:44,850
He pulls it from my dad.

33
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:46,080
He gets out of my day goes,

34
00:00:46,081 --> 00:00:47,070
you want to fucking go?

35
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:47,610
My Dad's like,

36
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:48,181
oh no.

37
00:00:48,181 --> 00:00:49,770
Like an old school Irish boxer.

38
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:50,653
Oh No.

39
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:53,250
I remember being like 10 or 11 being like,

40
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:53,820
ah,

41
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:54,990
fuck man.

42
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:58,200
See the problem with that is Nick
Diaz can actually fight like that.

43
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:00,120
Oh my dad be his breaks off this dude.

44
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:00,660
Yeah.

45
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:03,990
It was about to throw him off the side
of the highway and a leather jacket.

46
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:04,711
No,

47
00:01:04,711 --> 00:01:07,260
I did not fuck around when
a guy stands out like that,

48
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:09,990
so that's doing the old school boxing
and one of two things can happen.

49
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:13,500
He's trying to scare you off
or he's so good with his hands.

50
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:14,770
He's just kind of roll out.

51
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:15,031
You're like,

52
00:01:15,031 --> 00:01:15,661
what's up dude?

53
00:01:15,661 --> 00:01:16,494
You want some?

54
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:16,921
Yeah,

55
00:01:16,921 --> 00:01:17,610
man.

56
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:18,443
Yeah,

57
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:20,613
he was weird.

58
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:22,763
I'll tell you what,

59
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:23,880
for real man,

60
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:25,590
I remember my dad got in the car.

61
00:01:25,591 --> 00:01:25,891
I'm like,

62
00:01:25,891 --> 00:01:27,000
God dammit.

63
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,260
And then my brother gets out,

64
00:01:28,261 --> 00:01:29,940
kicks guy in the balls from behind,

65
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:34,650
but others probably 12 at the time he's
this Christ brother kicked a grown man

66
00:01:34,651 --> 00:01:36,000
and the role of men in the balls,

67
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:38,950
but that's when it gets really dangerous
because that kid gets involved.

68
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:41,070
Father becomes like super violent.

69
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:43,830
Little Brown was doing what
was crying in the backseat.

70
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:45,173
How old were you?

71
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,670
Probably like 10 or 11
crying in the backseat seat.

72
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:54,300
Can't be trusted if shit goes down
because you gotta remember my daycare was

73
00:01:54,301 --> 00:01:55,380
Shane Carbon on top of me.

74
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:57,120
I wasn't getting a lot of take downs.

75
00:01:57,121 --> 00:01:59,040
I was on my back all the time.

76
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:01,440
That's a crazy way to
start your training in MMA.

77
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:02,363
It was horrible,

78
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:03,620
horrible mess.

79
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:04,453
So crazy.

80
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:05,071
Every day.

81
00:02:05,071 --> 00:02:06,060
Just beat me up.

82
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,100
Trevor Whitman seems like a crazy dude,

83
00:02:08,101 --> 00:02:08,340
man.

84
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:09,111
He's a good dude.

85
00:02:09,111 --> 00:02:10,440
I mean he was like a very good dude.

86
00:02:10,441 --> 00:02:10,861
Good guy.

87
00:02:10,861 --> 00:02:11,870
I haven't been there in years.

88
00:02:11,871 --> 00:02:14,790
The maniac like he had Shane Carwyn.

89
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,330
Um,

90
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:18,240
like why they wanted to have
Shane Carwyn sport spar with GSP.

91
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,621
GSP was like,

92
00:02:19,621 --> 00:02:20,280
what?

93
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:20,820
Yeah,

94
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:21,450
why would I,

95
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:22,283
why?

96
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:23,370
Why would I spar him?

97
00:02:23,371 --> 00:02:24,570
Like what are you talking about?

98
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:28,170
And I think Trevor's a genius
becomes a strike and stuff like that.

99
00:02:28,171 --> 00:02:32,670
But I think back on it and there's this
thing where I felt like I had to prove

100
00:02:32,671 --> 00:02:36,300
to everyone I could hang with Shane car
and no matter when we were sparring,

101
00:02:36,301 --> 00:02:37,590
that's how my footwork got so good.

102
00:02:37,591 --> 00:02:37,920
Cause I'm,

103
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,600
I'm used to this giant water buffalo
mad water buffalo chasing me around the

104
00:02:42,601 --> 00:02:43,231
octagon.

105
00:02:43,231 --> 00:02:45,750
So I was trying to get out of the
way cause he landed right hand.

106
00:02:45,751 --> 00:02:46,590
It was a short him,

107
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:48,310
he was not a good man is trouble.

108
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:48,991
He hit so hard,

109
00:02:48,991 --> 00:02:49,771
he's got so,

110
00:02:49,771 --> 00:02:51,180
so I got used to that right.

111
00:02:51,181 --> 00:02:54,050
And I'm moving nonstop and
then when the bell goes,

112
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:54,361
Ding,

113
00:02:54,361 --> 00:02:55,740
Ding with 30 seconds left,

114
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:56,611
literally,

115
00:02:56,611 --> 00:02:57,710
no matter what we're doing,

116
00:02:57,850 --> 00:02:59,160
I mean Shane would stop,

117
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,790
walk to the middle of the cage
and just rock 'em sock 'em robots.

118
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:04,630
Damn.

119
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:05,890
I did that for three years.

120
00:03:05,891 --> 00:03:08,470
And then finally a part of me was like,

121
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:09,453
uh,

122
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,540
how about no?

123
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:12,760
And I shot a double back on him
and we've never done that again.

124
00:03:12,761 --> 00:03:13,594
Yeah,

125
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,350
I'm tired.

126
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:15,970
But I think back on my training,

127
00:03:15,971 --> 00:03:16,211
I'm like,

128
00:03:16,211 --> 00:03:16,421
God,

129
00:03:16,421 --> 00:03:17,254
that was stupid.

130
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:18,610
Even taking them down.

131
00:03:18,611 --> 00:03:18,761
I mean,

132
00:03:18,761 --> 00:03:21,320
he's so strong and he's a big Guy Guy.

133
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:23,170
Ever did a big fucking guy,

134
00:03:23,171 --> 00:03:23,560
man.

135
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,210
Strong.

136
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:27,700
A lot stronger than you and your
strong Shane is 100% stronger than me.

137
00:03:27,701 --> 00:03:28,420
Not even close.

138
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:29,620
He's ridiculously strong.

139
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,840
Bone structure is just,

140
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:32,830
he's bigger than car.

141
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:33,870
He's bigger than Lesner.

142
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:35,110
He's legs are thick,

143
00:03:35,111 --> 00:03:35,944
thick ass,

144
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:37,000
huge shoulders.

145
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,200
He's hands man.

146
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:39,680
Before they did,

147
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:42,270
they redid the UFC gloves
to fit over his hands.

148
00:03:42,271 --> 00:03:43,360
Shane's the reason Shane's,

149
00:03:43,361 --> 00:03:44,950
the reason why they changed the glove,

150
00:03:44,951 --> 00:03:46,410
Shane had a five XL gloves.

151
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:49,630
You have to cut the glove just to get
over to his hands are so ridiculous.

152
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:49,751
Yeah.

153
00:03:49,751 --> 00:03:50,351
When you shake them,

154
00:03:50,351 --> 00:03:51,580
it's like holding onto a ham.

155
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,050
What was frustrating to me is,

156
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:53,350
you know,

157
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:54,940
I've always been in love with Jujitsu.

158
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:55,690
I would spend,

159
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:58,930
Shane would get injured or you'd have
to work at a regular job and I was just

160
00:03:58,931 --> 00:04:02,140
train full time and I would think
I was being so good at Jujitsu.

161
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,450
Then Shane would come
in off a nine to five,

162
00:04:04,451 --> 00:04:04,691
you know,

163
00:04:04,691 --> 00:04:06,970
shift Walkin by Jujitsu Hunt,

164
00:04:06,971 --> 00:04:07,451
let's do it.

165
00:04:07,451 --> 00:04:07,751
And I'm like,

166
00:04:07,751 --> 00:04:09,310
I'm going to roll this big dude.

167
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,810
You just shut,

168
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:11,650
shut it all down.

169
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,790
When I was training at a malls,

170
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:13,980
he came by and uh,

171
00:04:13,981 --> 00:04:14,161
and,

172
00:04:14,161 --> 00:04:15,730
and trained one day and uh,

173
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:16,750
I didn't get to roll with them,

174
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:17,260
but uh,

175
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:19,600
I watched people row with them and it was,

176
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:22,770
it was like a child
playing with his daddy.

177
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:26,410
Daddy was just like rolling over.

178
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,000
I go with big guys.

179
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:30,070
I go the big guys all the time,

180
00:04:30,071 --> 00:04:31,330
but none like Shane,

181
00:04:31,331 --> 00:04:31,540
man,

182
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:33,880
he doesn't even look real
when he walked in the door.

183
00:04:33,881 --> 00:04:34,690
If I didn't know,

184
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:35,060
I was like,

185
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:35,893
what's up Shane?

186
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:39,850
But if I didn't know what I would be
like saying a peep this motherfucker,

187
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:42,190
he's got legs grown out of his shoulders.

188
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,300
This is how it happened.

189
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,051
I was like,

190
00:04:44,051 --> 00:04:44,171
oh,

191
00:04:44,171 --> 00:04:44,950
I want to be a fighter.

192
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:46,300
I had knew Nate mark cart.

193
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:47,740
I looked him up online,

194
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:49,650
found out where his academy was in Aurora,

195
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:50,470
my hometown.

196
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:51,370
I show up there.

197
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,510
Nate's a great guy,

198
00:04:52,511 --> 00:04:52,661
right?

199
00:04:52,661 --> 00:04:52,871
He's like,

200
00:04:52,871 --> 00:04:53,351
yeah man,

201
00:04:53,351 --> 00:04:54,184
well we can do,

202
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,061
we can do this.

203
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:55,894
We'll figure it out.

204
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:56,621
Come tomorrow.

205
00:04:56,621 --> 00:04:57,610
There's another big guy.

206
00:04:57,611 --> 00:04:58,300
He just,

207
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,470
he only has like one fight.

208
00:04:59,471 --> 00:05:01,960
He just started fighting
and he played football too.

209
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:02,291
I'm like,

210
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:02,441
oh,

211
00:05:02,441 --> 00:05:03,070
cool.

212
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:03,790
I show up.

213
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:04,601
It's spine,

214
00:05:04,601 --> 00:05:04,840
right?

215
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:07,350
I show up and in watching current,

216
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:09,160
the time is 315 lbs.

217
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:14,500
Fighting the WC just jacked look like a
silver back gorilla that just found the

218
00:05:14,501 --> 00:05:15,850
weight room and does nothing else.

219
00:05:15,851 --> 00:05:17,410
Just remember that when
he was really that big,

220
00:05:17,411 --> 00:05:19,630
there's a picture of him
that doesn't even look real.

221
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,620
It's insane.

222
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,713
And Nate,

223
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:22,300
Nate goes,

224
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,111
Oh hey,

225
00:05:23,111 --> 00:05:23,990
here's the guy wanted to,

226
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:25,870
yes you do introduce you to.

227
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:27,040
And uh,

228
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:30,340
since then me and Shane sparred and we
just stood toe to toe and neither one of

229
00:05:30,341 --> 00:05:31,270
us knew what we were doing,

230
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:32,410
blasting each other.

231
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:34,250
You rolled with guys,

232
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,180
I mean you had the biggest and the
baddest as a training partner forever.

233
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:38,343
The best man.

234
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,010
While he was like a little brother and
when I couldn't afford private training

235
00:05:42,011 --> 00:05:44,560
with Trevor Whitman and
chain blue to me so much,

236
00:05:44,561 --> 00:05:46,240
he paid for my training with Trevor,

237
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:49,840
for Shane having a guy like
you around and valuable,

238
00:05:49,841 --> 00:05:50,380
you know,

239
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:53,340
trying to find a giant pictures
cause me and him in Normandy,

240
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:53,860
Emilia,

241
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:55,990
I think one or two fights
at the time had zero.

242
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:57,350
The Machita fight,

243
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:58,213
he was,

244
00:05:58,220 --> 00:05:59,300
it was close wide.

245
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:00,080
That was a close fight.

246
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:00,913
I just thought,

247
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:02,720
what do you think it was about?

248
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:04,210
Was just rumbled.

249
00:06:04,211 --> 00:06:05,640
Just too is a monster.

250
00:06:05,641 --> 00:06:07,000
It's just too much of a monster monster.

251
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,120
Rumble's a scary guy.

252
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:09,090
Pops,

253
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:10,340
kid heavyweight.

254
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:10,751
God,

255
00:06:10,751 --> 00:06:11,331
it's so crazy.

256
00:06:11,331 --> 00:06:12,380
Almost stopped him in the first round.

257
00:06:12,381 --> 00:06:14,060
He broke his John Half
and the first round like,

258
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,990
or I'll ask you fought the last two rounds
with a John that was shifting up and

259
00:06:17,991 --> 00:06:19,370
down cause it was shattered in the side.

260
00:06:19,371 --> 00:06:20,630
Somebody who's fighting our last game,

261
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:22,400
he's got some good stories.

262
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:26,420
When we talk about how
guys are hyping fights,

263
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:27,910
it can backfire on you.

264
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:29,630
Like Yo with the metro and fight.

265
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:30,464
Me and Matt,

266
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:31,131
uh,

267
00:06:31,131 --> 00:06:33,620
you know we're buddies where we
can both talk a little smack.

268
00:06:33,621 --> 00:06:35,570
So it was good to hype
the fight talking smack,

269
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:35,960
right?

270
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:36,793
It was great.

271
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:38,690
When you fight legends like Mirko Cro,

272
00:06:38,691 --> 00:06:39,050
Cop,

273
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:40,010
Andre Arlovski,

274
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:43,400
big Nog with our [inaudible] fans
or hit me up on Twitter like,

275
00:06:43,401 --> 00:06:44,090
oh,

276
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:46,130
I can't wait to see
what your smack talk is.

277
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,660
There's no smack talk.

278
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:51,740
I don't need to talk smack the
Andre you to hype this fight.

279
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:52,730
He's a legend.

280
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:54,440
You're not going to win any fans over.

281
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:55,363
What are you going to say?

282
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:56,293
What are you going to say?

283
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:56,961
Oh man,

284
00:06:56,961 --> 00:06:59,120
you fucked the very best
fighters in the world.

285
00:06:59,121 --> 00:07:00,020
You're a heavyweight champ,

286
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:00,741
you know what I mean?

287
00:07:00,741 --> 00:07:03,470
What are you gonna do you
gotta be super respectful man.

288
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,460
Otherwise they fucking attack like whoa.

289
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:08,780
Like it did the fund itself.

290
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:09,471
But tell him,

291
00:07:09,471 --> 00:07:10,400
tell him the story about how,

292
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:11,510
how you wrote your,

293
00:07:11,511 --> 00:07:13,390
a training with our Lasky after,

294
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,900
for after training where he's,

295
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:15,411
he goes,

296
00:07:15,411 --> 00:07:16,130
come here.

297
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:16,371
Yeah.

298
00:07:16,371 --> 00:07:16,700
Yeah.

299
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:17,151
So,

300
00:07:17,151 --> 00:07:17,984
uh,

301
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:21,770
Andrea Alaska and I used to train together
Jackson's camp and when I was getting

302
00:07:21,771 --> 00:07:24,470
ready for a fight this over
shoot almost four years ago,

303
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,600
the two fighters that I,

304
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:30,200
when I first got into the game that
I admired and loved where Mirko Cro,

305
00:07:30,201 --> 00:07:33,710
cop and Andre are Laski
by two very favorites.

306
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:34,760
That's who I wanted to be like.

307
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:38,690
So I walked in the gym and it was our
last keys first day at Jackson's too.

308
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:39,980
And uh,

309
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:40,341
you know,

310
00:07:40,341 --> 00:07:42,440
when you seen a guy on
TV fighting all the time,

311
00:07:42,441 --> 00:07:43,310
then you run into and be like,

312
00:07:43,311 --> 00:07:43,850
damn,

313
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:44,390
all right.

314
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:45,111
So I see him like,

315
00:07:45,111 --> 00:07:45,561
Oh shit,

316
00:07:45,561 --> 00:07:46,450
this under Lasky.

317
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:48,890
So then that guy [inaudible]
our last year in the ring,

318
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:49,410
uh,

319
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:50,151
first day spine,

320
00:07:50,151 --> 00:07:50,450
right,

321
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:51,400
fresh off the plane.

322
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:52,263
When I'm sparring with him.

323
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:54,380
So me and him are gone and it's a,

324
00:07:54,381 --> 00:07:55,520
it's a close round.

325
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,560
He's a bad ass right at me and
we're going back and forth.

326
00:07:57,561 --> 00:08:01,640
People would literally stop and watch a
spar were just these dog rounds back and

327
00:08:01,641 --> 00:08:01,941
forth,

328
00:08:01,941 --> 00:08:02,930
five rounds in a row.

329
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:06,980
Then later that night we grapple and then,

330
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,210
uh,

331
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:09,560
the next morning I drink
coffee every morning,

332
00:08:09,561 --> 00:08:09,890
right?

333
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:12,290
Drinking coffee now this
horrible coffee breath,

334
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:14,330
breath smelled like pure coffees.

335
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:14,871
Shit breath.

336
00:08:14,871 --> 00:08:15,520
Right.

337
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:19,640
And I go up to Andre and he's
not very warm person at all.

338
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:20,691
Not at all.

339
00:08:20,691 --> 00:08:23,600
Is that very bell rush in where it's
going to take a while to be his friend.

340
00:08:23,601 --> 00:08:25,710
I can tell and I'm trying
to break these barriers.

341
00:08:25,711 --> 00:08:26,210
Van,

342
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:26,840
I go,

343
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:27,440
hey bro,

344
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,460
I just want to let you know,

345
00:08:28,461 --> 00:08:28,850
man.

346
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:30,710
I got the coffee breath and he,

347
00:08:30,711 --> 00:08:30,860
uh,

348
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:32,300
he didn't say a word
to me the night before.

349
00:08:32,301 --> 00:08:33,134
Training goes,

350
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:34,063
it's okay.

351
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:35,120
It's okay.

352
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,530
Much better than yesterday.

353
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:37,370
Yesterday.

354
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:38,203
Shit.

355
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,340
Cool black.

356
00:08:39,341 --> 00:08:40,640
He goes yesterday,

357
00:08:40,641 --> 00:08:42,110
breast smelled like Shit.

358
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:43,790
Oh,

359
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:44,390
cool man.

360
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:44,691
Cool.

361
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:46,040
And then just went about our business.

362
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,080
That was really the only
words he ever said to me,

363
00:08:48,081 --> 00:08:48,450
man.

364
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:49,970
And we trained together for a while.

365
00:08:49,971 --> 00:08:51,020
It wasn't even like framing.

366
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:52,250
What about when you were kicking,

367
00:08:52,251 --> 00:08:53,600
when he had you kick his body?

368
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:54,350
Yeah.

369
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:55,960
And then we done training.

370
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:56,761
I've never done this.

371
00:08:56,761 --> 00:08:57,430
He goes,

372
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:58,040
ah,

373
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,620
I'm trying to do my
best Russian accent it,

374
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:01,020
you guys are pretty much terrible rush.

375
00:09:01,021 --> 00:09:01,230
Nice.

376
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:01,651
Horrible.

377
00:09:01,651 --> 00:09:01,950
Right.

378
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:02,220
Okay.

379
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:02,491
Sorry,

380
00:09:02,491 --> 00:09:03,324
I'm not from Russia.

381
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:04,290
The bus,

382
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:05,123
he goes out,

383
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:05,431
he goes,

384
00:09:05,431 --> 00:09:07,200
put your hands on top
of your head like this.

385
00:09:07,201 --> 00:09:07,501
And I'm like,

386
00:09:07,501 --> 00:09:08,041
what are we doing?

387
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:08,940
And we just got done sparring.

388
00:09:08,941 --> 00:09:09,770
I'm exhausted,

389
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:10,020
right?

390
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:14,820
I put my hands up and he just goes braced
herself and starts wailing at my body.

391
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,360
Why?

392
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,770
With kicks punches Waylon.

393
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:18,630
It was this,

394
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:19,800
this make you tough.

395
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:20,880
My okay.

396
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,630
And I'm like,

397
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:22,181
oh,

398
00:09:22,181 --> 00:09:23,800
I'll try to be tough
though cause he's my hair.

399
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:24,240
I'm like,

400
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:24,541
oh,

401
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:25,010
okay.

402
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:25,970
Wow.

403
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:26,821
And then he goes,

404
00:09:26,821 --> 00:09:27,511
my turn,

405
00:09:27,511 --> 00:09:28,344
you do it to me.

406
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:29,161
And I'm like,

407
00:09:29,161 --> 00:09:29,361
dude,

408
00:09:29,361 --> 00:09:29,610
he goes,

409
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:29,821
no,

410
00:09:29,821 --> 00:09:33,530
you hit like girl hit and
I'm fucking trying man.

411
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:34,590
Trying to hurt this guy.

412
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,580
Nothing.

413
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,400
And that was my experience
with Andre Arlovski.

414
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,830
I'm a day cutting and baby Dick Sense.

415
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:41,970
I don't know anything about cutting,

416
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:43,171
cutting,

417
00:09:43,171 --> 00:09:44,190
sucking baby deck,

418
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:45,970
all that Moses,

419
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:49,710
when he cut his own penis to show his
Serbians to God in the Old Testament.

420
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:52,750
That's a very weird way to
show your speed speaking.

421
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:55,170
But you're at a friend break a Dick Moses.

422
00:09:55,171 --> 00:09:56,010
I heard of that before.

423
00:09:56,011 --> 00:09:56,700
I've had a friend break.

424
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,210
A Dick had rush from the emergency room

425
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:00,901
fixed.

426
00:10:00,901 --> 00:10:01,291
Totally.

427
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:03,090
Or is it always kind of hooked it Kinda,

428
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:03,500
yeah.

429
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,560
Curves to the left a little bit.

430
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:05,190
Wow.

431
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:07,800
His balls literally
internal bleeding filled up.

432
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:09,960
Oh my look like purple Gecko skin.

433
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:11,910
That's why you gotta be kept
careful with crazy bitches.

434
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:12,950
You got to get double under hook.

435
00:10:12,951 --> 00:10:13,784
Some crazy bitch.

436
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:14,850
I do my bit crazy.

437
00:10:14,851 --> 00:10:15,810
Bitches riding you.

438
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:16,280
You gotta.

439
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,400
You gotta hold their ass.

440
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:19,080
But like a from [inaudible].

441
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:20,630
You know how you got to go plum.

442
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,640
You can't just do this
because if you do this,

443
00:10:23,641 --> 00:10:25,260
there's too much lateral room.

444
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,710
There's room for down.

445
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:28,820
I got to get a study.

446
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:29,663
Gable grip.

447
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:30,810
The lower hips.

448
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:32,880
My buddy is huge.

449
00:10:32,881 --> 00:10:33,650
You've met this guy,

450
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:34,950
I'm not going to say his name on there.

451
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:36,050
These guys,

452
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:36,520
six,

453
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,910
six to 70 sram ways wait,

454
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:42,510
people are going to figure out who they
won't figure it out is so he's like,

455
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:43,051
he tells me,

456
00:10:43,051 --> 00:10:43,261
he goes,

457
00:10:43,261 --> 00:10:43,560
Bro,

458
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,240
this girl wants it so hard.

459
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:45,541
He goes,

460
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:46,470
I don't know what to do,

461
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:47,311
how hard.

462
00:10:47,311 --> 00:10:47,521
He goes,

463
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:48,570
I'm going to film it next time.

464
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:54,690
So he films it and it's one of the
most disturbing videos I've ever seen.

465
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:55,381
I mean,

466
00:10:55,381 --> 00:10:56,660
he's getting air like,

467
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,651
why am I'm like,

468
00:10:58,651 --> 00:10:59,484
Dang.

469
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,420
Later he calls me,

470
00:11:01,421 --> 00:11:01,561
he goes,

471
00:11:01,561 --> 00:11:01,891
dude,

472
00:11:01,891 --> 00:11:02,970
get over here.

473
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,320
I rush over.

474
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:04,920
What's the man?

475
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:05,581
He's on the ground,

476
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:06,510
but button they go like,

477
00:11:06,511 --> 00:11:07,344
what's the values?

478
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:08,490
That video I showed you,

479
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:09,690
I was backing up,

480
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,220
missed my penis,

481
00:11:11,221 --> 00:11:12,054
hit her ass,

482
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:14,190
broke his dick.

483
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:15,990
Oh my God.

484
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:17,130
So this is what I tell him.

485
00:11:17,131 --> 00:11:17,311
I go,

486
00:11:17,311 --> 00:11:17,820
Bro,

487
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:18,900
this is an easy fix,

488
00:11:18,901 --> 00:11:19,201
right?

489
00:11:19,201 --> 00:11:19,530
I,

490
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:20,080
I've,

491
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:20,520
I'm,

492
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,140
I have no idea how to hand this doctor.

493
00:11:22,141 --> 00:11:22,801
Shab yeah,

494
00:11:22,801 --> 00:11:23,820
doctor shop in the house.

495
00:11:23,821 --> 00:11:25,080
Big brown.shop in the house.

496
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,220
I know this easy fix.

497
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:27,480
I'm going to step out of the room.

498
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:28,590
You put a little porno on,

499
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:29,540
you get erect.

500
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:30,850
We are just going to line it right back,

501
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:32,791
right back up.

502
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:34,230
Just like he fix a broken nose.

503
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:36,300
That's a great strategy,

504
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:37,440
right?

505
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,041
Make sense?

506
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:39,480
That's a great shot out of the room.

507
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:40,790
10 minutes later I hear it.

508
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:43,231
I'm like,

509
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:43,740
Oh shit.

510
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,180
So I call my doctor buddy.

Yo man club my,

514
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,471
broke his stick.

515
00:11:49,471 --> 00:11:49,711
He goes,

516
00:11:49,711 --> 00:11:49,921

517
00:11:49,921 --> 00:11:51,780

00:11:51,781 --> 00:11:52,081

00:11:52,321 --> 00:11:52,920
they're pretty big.

521
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:53,711
Let see your task goes,

522
00:11:53,711 --> 00:11:54,190

523
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:58,030

a grapefruit and it looks like ghetto

524
00:11:58,031 --> 00:12:00,790
purple dotted scam all over la rush,

525
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:03,400
rush in the emergency room
cause internal bleeding.

526
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:04,780
And uh,

527
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,740
people thought we were just to gays

528
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:11,200
gay math.

529
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,033
Big dudes.

530
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:13,660
I'm not making this up.

531
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,310
I wish I could make this up.

532
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,740
He straddled in a Gurney like this,

533
00:12:17,741 --> 00:12:18,070
right?

534
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:20,740
He's like this things hanging down.

535
00:12:20,741 --> 00:12:21,574
It's filling up,

536
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:23,770
talking to this nurse comes in,

537
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,353
hey boys,

538
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:26,740
flaming,

539
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:28,240
flaming gay guy,

540
00:12:28,241 --> 00:12:28,481
right?

541
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:29,080
Which is whatever.

542
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:29,913
I'm cool with that.

543
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:31,420
Legs up in style.

544
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:33,220
If this is his broken penis,

545
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:34,540
this dude's like this.

546
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:36,460
Hmm,

547
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:37,983
yeah,

548
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:38,231
yeah.

549
00:12:38,231 --> 00:12:39,280
This is pretty bad.

550
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:39,911
Listen,

551
00:12:39,911 --> 00:12:41,650
we get a doctor and we'll be right back.

552
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,570
He's doing that to his boss and I'm like,

553
00:12:43,571 --> 00:12:44,860
what is going on here?

554
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:47,080
Leaves doc comes in,

555
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:47,681
old dude.

556
00:12:47,681 --> 00:12:47,921
I'm like,

557
00:12:47,921 --> 00:12:48,250
oh,

558
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:49,083
thank God.

559
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:49,931
Dot comes in.

560
00:12:49,931 --> 00:12:50,141
He goes,

561
00:12:50,141 --> 00:12:50,561
yeah man,

562
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:51,550
this is really bad.

563
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:52,590
Or yeah,

564
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:53,080
the,

565
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,490
the nurse was Kinda,

566
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:55,653
uh,

567
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,141
you know,

568
00:12:56,141 --> 00:12:58,510
he's grabbing a man and it's
insane how badly he goes,

569
00:12:58,730 --> 00:12:58,990
whoa,

570
00:12:58,990 --> 00:12:59,190
Whoa,

571
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:00,023
whoa.

572
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,060
A nurse physically touched his penis,

573
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,433
touched

574
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:13,350
telescope nose deep in his,

575
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,193
on his dick.

576
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:14,890
And he goes,

577
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:15,281
wow,

578
00:13:15,281 --> 00:13:18,100
I need to get the name of that
guy because that is not code here.

579
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:25,130
Dick [inaudible] got an app on his phone
and when anybody gets administered to

580
00:13:30,731 --> 00:13:31,960
the hospital with a broken deck,

581
00:13:31,961 --> 00:13:32,890
he fucking shows up,

582
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:35,110
puts her hands,

583
00:13:35,111 --> 00:13:35,320
this,

584
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:35,591
this,

585
00:13:35,591 --> 00:13:36,680
you're all just comes in.

586
00:13:36,681 --> 00:13:37,390
And I go,

587
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:38,141
I gotta be honest,

588
00:13:38,141 --> 00:13:38,974
man.

589
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:41,500
How did you get into
basically majoring in Dick's?

590
00:13:41,501 --> 00:13:46,000
Like what road did you go down and he
said in Egypt there's someplace in Egypt

591
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:48,010
where there's a religion.

592
00:13:48,011 --> 00:13:48,880
They might be Muslim,

593
00:13:48,881 --> 00:13:49,301
I'm not sure.

594
00:13:49,301 --> 00:13:50,260
But they get erections.

595
00:13:50,261 --> 00:13:51,094
They think it's Dell,

596
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:52,150
the Satan's work.

597
00:13:52,151 --> 00:13:53,800
And they break their dad's not in.

598
00:13:53,801 --> 00:13:55,510
That's not Muslim religion.

599
00:13:55,511 --> 00:13:56,170
That might be,

600
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:56,471
well no,

601
00:13:56,471 --> 00:13:57,930
it's an extremist Muslim.

602
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:02,380
He was saying there are Muslim just sounds
like a dumb person who this look the

603
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:03,790
whatever it is.

604
00:14:03,791 --> 00:14:07,180
It's another crazy cause he was
saying and these guys need help.

605
00:14:07,181 --> 00:14:09,430
So he got into it because
he was exposed to it.

606
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:11,830
So these guys think it's Satan's work.

607
00:14:11,831 --> 00:14:12,461
The Devil's work.

608
00:14:12,461 --> 00:14:13,330
They'd get erections,

609
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:14,440
snap their day.

610
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:16,930
A lot of them die from internal bleeding.

611
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:17,230
He,

612
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:18,550
they brushed doctors down there.

613
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:21,190
So most urologists go down
to this part of the world.

614
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:22,083
That's a fix it.

615
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:23,261
Anyways,

616
00:14:23,261 --> 00:14:24,050
my buddy,

617
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:24,883
my buddy,

618
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:25,810
a break,

619
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:26,591
he's all good.

620
00:14:26,591 --> 00:14:27,610
Now the update of my friend,

621
00:14:27,611 --> 00:14:28,061
all good.

622
00:14:28,061 --> 00:14:31,240
They give him pills so he couldn't get
an erection for six weeks and his dick

623
00:14:31,241 --> 00:14:31,990
was in a splint.

624
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:32,600
Really?

625
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,490
A splints.

626
00:14:33,491 --> 00:14:35,770
Splints and it has a hook.

627
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:36,641
Yeah.

628
00:14:36,641 --> 00:14:39,640
So White Hook or a big one notice.

629
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:40,180
Oh,

630
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:40,931
it's definitely knows.

631
00:14:40,931 --> 00:14:41,681
What are you a,

632
00:14:41,681 --> 00:14:43,120
it'd be a little hyperbole there.

633
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:44,330
May never seen one of reports.

634
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,070
How about that?

635
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:45,830
Fuck all.

636
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:47,540
Haven't I didn't man.

637
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:48,851
Swear to God.

638
00:14:48,851 --> 00:14:49,684
I have never seen her.

639
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:50,501
Not One.

640
00:14:50,501 --> 00:14:51,470
You've never seen her work.

641
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,900
How dare you not do
research for that episode?

642
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:54,650
Yeah.

643
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:55,341
Well I know she's,

644
00:14:55,341 --> 00:14:56,174
I went,

645
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:56,900
yeah,

646
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,180
she does some heavy shit too.

647
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:58,390
Oh,

648
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:00,080
and almost too much where you go.

649
00:15:00,081 --> 00:15:00,321
Okay,

650
00:15:00,321 --> 00:15:01,940
well that can't be well on my podcast,

651
00:15:01,941 --> 00:15:06,400
she said her skin was bad because
she was taken in her Varun.

652
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:06,801
Tom Said,

653
00:15:06,801 --> 00:15:08,780
I think you're taking in
too much testosterone.

654
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,010
Too many loads.

655
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:10,843
Yeah,

656
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:11,830
she's got a,

657
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,160
you got a whore on your hands

658
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:16,220
or be off casting.

659
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:20,270
You imagine if you take it so many
loads that it changes your biological

660
00:15:20,271 --> 00:15:20,870
profile.

661
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:22,210
You imagine if you're just dating a girl,

662
00:15:22,211 --> 00:15:24,230
she had come my fucking
face keeps breaking out.

663
00:15:24,231 --> 00:15:24,710
What's happening?

664
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:26,540
He's fucking guys busted all over my face,

665
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:27,680
man in her.

666
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:28,950
Oh,

667
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:29,751
you're ingest so much.

668
00:15:29,751 --> 00:15:31,970
Come in her body probably annually.

669
00:15:31,971 --> 00:15:32,460
A lot of it.

670
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:34,170
Yes and

671
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:38,720
I don't,

672
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,500
that doesn't make that noise when
I'm coming unless I'm part injured.

673
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:42,260
Yeah.

674
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:45,920
I've never had that noise because
there's something hot about that though.

675
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,870
I would agree with you with asa.

676
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:49,003
I agree.

677
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:51,270
I like a turbo slot and so

678
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:57,500
most of the contact asa and
have her print up that shirt

679
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:00,030
with glitter.

680
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:01,210
I'll bake you a shirt

681
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:05,680
Hashtag [inaudible]
