33

Hello fantasy football dorks.

34
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,800
Football is back and draft
kings.com isn't fucking around.

35
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:23,580
draftkings.com is America's favorite
one week fantasy football site.

36
00:02:23,581 --> 00:02:28,581
And you get get your piece of $5
million being awarded this week.

37
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:32,490
That's what, that's some ridiculous
shit. They have real money.

38
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:34,620
Like I thought fantasy football was,
you know,

39
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:38,790
just a bunch of guys having a good
time. Being silly. There's a lot,

40
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,230
there's a lot more involved in it.

41
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:44,700
I have a championship belt. I'm, I'm a
calm the comedy store fantasy champion.

42
00:02:44,701 --> 00:02:47,220
I don't talk about him. Sort of a
closet case, but you don't eat that.

43
00:02:47,221 --> 00:02:51,060
You don't think it's serious. I have a
championship belt Joe who made the belt.

44
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:54,090
Uh, the commissioner of the
League. It has the big comedy.

45
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:57,980
It's all gold and black as a goal. If
someone spent money on those, yeah,

46
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:00,010
we all threw in an extra or 20

47
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:04,780
bucks and it's like $200
belt. It is awesome. No.

48
00:03:04,781 --> 00:03:06,100
Um,
if you lose,

49
00:03:06,101 --> 00:03:09,220
do you have to give that belt up or
do you keep a copy of the belt forever

50
00:03:09,221 --> 00:03:10,090
because you were the champ?

51
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:13,990
Unfortunately our league isn't that luxury
to where you get to keep a model belt

52
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:17,350
that the Belko sign to the next winter.
Yeah,

53
00:03:17,351 --> 00:03:20,230
because everybody always wonders
that like with boxing matches,

54
00:03:20,231 --> 00:03:22,830
like how does that work? Does a
guy get the belt? You get a copy,

55
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:25,630
your own Belks guys keep a belt.
If you were the champ,

56
00:03:25,631 --> 00:03:28,630
you go over like sugar ray Leonard's
house. He's still got the belt.

57
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:33,360
He's not the champion anymore. But
the belts Dylan his house. Yeah. Hmm.

58
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:35,870
They give you a replica
works that way with program.

59
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,000
They should give you the real one,

60
00:03:37,001 --> 00:03:41,200
the replica that we should be a new one
for the new champion. Hey gree. So I feel,

61
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:46,570
uh, so if you're one of those guys, one
of those Tony Hinchcliffe type characters,

62
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:50,080
we got away to take
shit to the next level.

63
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:54,880
The next level with draft kings.com
you've already scouted players for your

64
00:03:54,881 --> 00:03:58,660
season long team. You turn that knowledge
into instant cash, ladies and gentlemen.

65
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:02,710
Mostly ladies. No, what's the gentleman?

66
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:08,030
Heather? I need women at all that are
in fantasy football. Draft Queens.

67
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:13,020
There's always those chicks like, um, uh,

68
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:18,060
Amy Schumer had a bit about it on her
show about like girls who can hang and

69
00:04:18,551 --> 00:04:22,050
it's so true. There's always
those girls that, you know,

70
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:27,010
they had dapped they become one of the
guys are Tiana. Is she one of those? Oh,

71
00:04:27,011 --> 00:04:29,810
she's huge into it. Big Time
into fantasy football. Yeah.

72
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:35,030
She's in multiple leagues. That's trolling
for Dick. I know what she's up to.

73
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:37,240
I'm not hating.
Last year,

74
00:04:37,241 --> 00:04:42,220
one player turned 11 bucks into 4,000 in
one weekend and I say that with all due

75
00:04:42,221 --> 00:04:46,150
respect. I liked Sarah.
She's awesome. Um, yeah.

76
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:50,680
One Dude seriously turned 11 bucks into
$4,000 in one weekend and another player

77
00:04:50,681 --> 00:04:55,681
won $1 million in one day
playing fantasy football.

78
00:04:55,961 --> 00:04:59,430
Awesome. Fucking say that again.
Some asshole when I'm not,

79
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:01,750
I don't mean ass all like,
I mean asshole.

80
00:05:01,751 --> 00:05:03,640
Like I would call myself
an asshole person.

81
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:08,320
Won a million bucks in a fucking
day playing fantasy football.

82
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:09,640

I'm going to fuck up you like the rock,

111
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:56,400
bro. I just started working out again a
month ago and take my approach people to

112
00:06:56,401 --> 00:07:01,160
seven minute workouts a day. That's the
way to not get hurt. You could do it.

113
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:04,260
I did want to do it nice and slow.

114
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:07,740
seven minutes. My hemp force.

One scoop of peanut butter pack an
extra protein, little bit almond milk.

117

Good bye.
I got Tony.

118
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:23,100
I've got Tony to eat some meat this
past weekend and I don't mean my deck.

119
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,960
I mean I got him to eat. He ate
a piece of beef. Did you love it?

120
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:30,690
Was it the best tasting
thing I was eating?

121
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:35,310
What's not told in this story is that
in front of me I had three jumbo grilled

122
00:07:35,311 --> 00:07:37,930
shrimp, a crab cake and uh, and uh,

123
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:42,480
Sam and that had crab meat on it.
And it, you know, it's all amazing.

124
00:07:42,481 --> 00:07:45,790
Food is great. I love the
whole food. Honestly, the,

125
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:50,970
I love steak always have it. Couldn't
quite compare with what I ordered,

00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:53,520
you know what I mean? But that's
what I like. I eat what I like.

127
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:59,820
I love steak point is Tony ate meat
for the longest time until he's been a

128
00:07:59,821 --> 00:08:02,310
vegetarian sort of. You eat fish. Yeah,

129
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:05,420
I remember I was there one day where you
ate something you weren't supposed to

130
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,240
like a like a muffin
or something like that.

00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,880
Tony and I will be at the Ice
House comedy club next weekend.

145
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:07,680
September 12th and 13th that's
right. Freak bitches. New Material.

146
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:12,320
Rolling out. Preparing
the next hour. What?

147
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:13,303
Cue The music

148
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:21,240
Rogan experience. Try by day. Joe
Rogan podcast by night all day.

149
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:24,120
Good.
Google Mowgli.

150
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:27,630
Tony Hinchcliffe a world tour.
We've been on young man. Yeah,

151
00:09:27,631 --> 00:09:31,830
we've been everywhere. We've traveled
the globe. We've extended our reach.

152
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:34,350
We've done sets throughout the lands.

153
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:39,500
We've gone from the high of the rocky
mountains all the way to a hockey rink in

154
00:09:39,961 --> 00:09:44,280
the middle of Canada. We did so
much the past couple months. Yeah,

155
00:09:44,281 --> 00:09:45,660
we did a hockey rink and we,

156
00:09:45,661 --> 00:09:48,870
me and Bryan County did a
goddamn hockey rink in Canada.

157
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:52,800
Like what a stereotype way up there too,
man. It's two hours north of Edmonton.

158
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:56,070
Yeah. Yeah. What was the name of
that town again? Lloydminster.

159
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:59,550
Lloydminster Nice folks.
Great people. Great people.

160
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:03,180
A lot of people talking about how they
drove three hours from the north and

161
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:06,263
yeah,
it was,

162
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:10,080
that's what happens when you do those
middle of nowhere shows you get access to

163
00:10:10,081 --> 00:10:14,310
a bunch of people that ordinarily they
just can't physically get to you in time.

164
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:15,690
Right.
It takes too much time.

165
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:20,130
I talked to this one duty drove 18 hours
once to a show. Wow. Yeah. That's a god.

166
00:10:20,131 --> 00:10:23,580
A God damn responsibility when you're
telling jokes to a guy who drove 18 hours.

167
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:28,260
Yeah. That's, that's uh, I'm
glad you told me after the show.

168
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:32,250
Tell me before the show, I'd be like,
fuck, I can't even do new shit now.

169
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:35,220
I've gotta give this guy some fuck.
I gotta throw some heat.

170
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:41,730
1818 is a long trip. That's a
hell of a trip. But yeah, dude,

171
00:10:41,731 --> 00:10:44,770
we, we'd been everywhere man.
Those, uh, those gigs up in Canada,

172
00:10:44,771 --> 00:10:47,850
number fucking bad ass.
We went from one place,

173
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:49,350
which is in the middle of the nowhere,

174
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,440
which was a hockey rink to
that theater in Vancouver.

175
00:10:52,441 --> 00:10:57,270
That was just fucking incredible. Yeah.
It was like the perfect contrast. Yeah.

176
00:10:57,510 --> 00:11:01,620
Like three or 4,000 seat crazy
theater with big fancy chandelier.

177
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:05,640
So it was like game of Thrones. Yeah. And
it was right to do it the right way to,

178
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,790
we did the hockey rink first and
then the Nice theater second.

179
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:12,690
If we did it the other way, it would
be depressing. Yeah. Toto was like, oh,

180
00:11:12,691 --> 00:11:17,340
it's over. Look at us. We're in a fucking
hockey rink now. Yeah. Joan Rivers,

181
00:11:17,341 --> 00:11:21,960
just a Oh yeah, that's a
rough one. Yeah. So, uh,

182
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:26,880
rest in peace. Joan Rivers,
that chick, you know, agree
with or not agree with her.

183
00:11:26,881 --> 00:11:27,061
I mean,

184
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:31,860
a lot of people were mad at her about
her take on Gaza and the whole Israeli

185
00:11:31,861 --> 00:11:36,860
thing. She's Jewish and she's
old. You know, she was, but uh,

186
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:41,940
she was a real fucking comic. Real comic
will ever meet her till the very end. No,

187
00:11:41,941 --> 00:11:43,380
I was supposed to do her show,
man.

188
00:11:43,381 --> 00:11:47,730
I was supposed to do our show where I lie
in bed with her, like in bed with Joan.

189
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,480
Right. Yeah. Um,

190
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,980
that would have been the
first time I met her. She has

191
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:57,760
like a podcast that she does
from a bed and you know,

192
00:11:57,970 --> 00:12:00,310
people climb in bed with
her and you tell your jokes.

193
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,710
You might still have a chance if
you make it over there and then

194
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:07,120
you start of a

195
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:12,330
good excited on the too soon.
Joe Can, I always love that.

196
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:15,390
I can't believe you did it. It's my
favorite thing. Actually knew her.

197
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:16,600
Her daughter.
Yeah.

198
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:21,440
Pretty well though. Nope. No,
no, no. Never met her. No, no,

199
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:24,430
never met. I might've said hi to
her once at a place. Maybe I'm not,

200
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:28,380
never talked to her though. Um, that's um,

201
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:32,080
that's rough stuff man.
But you know, 81 years old

202
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:37,620
career, I mean she, you know,
she was like Carson's favorite.

203
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:40,590
Yes. Shouldn't have some
falling out with Carson. Yeah.

204
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:45,570
Cause she took a gig going up
against him from Fox. He was on NBC.

205
00:12:45,571 --> 00:12:49,740
She took the 1130. He built her,
he was, she was his guest host.

206
00:12:49,741 --> 00:12:53,940
And he was really offended when she
went against him competing and ratings.

207
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:58,580
Yeah, I dunno man. Uh,
I feel like, you know,

208
00:12:58,581 --> 00:13:00,500
I feel like that's unfortunate,

209
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:03,830
but the whole paradigm of television,

210
00:13:03,831 --> 00:13:08,030
like having to watch things at the same
time, like having an eight o'clock show,

211
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:11,030
you know, Mork and Mindy is competing
with, you know, Blah Blah Blah.

212
00:13:11,031 --> 00:13:13,370
That's on an another time.
Whenever you have that,

213
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:17,210
you're going to have these sort of
competitive type issues. It's going to be,

214
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:21,590
it's going to be gross.
That's the beautiful thing
about the Internet. You know,

215
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:24,290
like when it comes to
like podcasts and shows,

216
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,740
nobody tries to like compete with anybody.

217
00:13:27,741 --> 00:13:32,030
Nobody tries to keep like guests
from going to other podcasts.

218
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,950
No one does any of that.
Yeah.

219
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:35,620
Well,
when Joan was competing with Johnny,

220
00:13:35,621 --> 00:13:39,250
I'm pretty sure there was
just a regular flat screen.

221
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:42,580
I'm pretty sure that was just like three
or four channels at the time when those

222
00:13:42,581 --> 00:13:46,090
two are competing. So it's definitely
a whole new age, you know what I mean?

223
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:49,550
Yeah. Yeah. There was nothing
man there you had like,

224
00:13:49,551 --> 00:13:54,260
you didn't even have Fox back then.
You did ABC, CBS and NBC and that's it.

225
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:57,440
Yeah. What a fucking
monopoly, Huh? Oh, insane.

226
00:13:57,530 --> 00:14:00,050
They had America's mind and ears.
Yeah.

227
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:01,710
And the in the,
in America,

228
00:14:01,711 --> 00:14:04,260
if you wanted to find out or be
entertained by something else,

229
00:14:04,261 --> 00:14:06,630
you had to go find a book
or make your own movie.

230
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:11,430
Wow. Isn't that amazing? Yeah.
When you really think about it,

231
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:15,150
the numbers that they must have had,
like during the happy days,

232
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,190
like when happy days was a hit,

233
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:21,990
they must've had like 30 40 50
million people watching. Right.

234
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:27,090
Seems like it must be much more than
they have today because of the options

235
00:14:27,091 --> 00:14:29,030
today are so huge.
Yeah.

236
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:33,830
I don't think they can get one person to
watch as many as it as much at one time

237
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:38,110
would have. Yeah. It's amazing that you
still have network television really.

238
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:40,240
If you really stop and
think about it cause cable,

239
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:45,100
they can kind of do so much more.
Yeah. Like even if they don't swear,

240
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:48,010
I think about like the shit they
got away with on breaking bad.

241
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:52,100
You could never do that on NBC.
Right. They would never let you.

242
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:57,430
You can never have like open drug
selling and using and murder and all that

243
00:14:57,951 --> 00:15:01,940
crazy shit the way they do
it. Yeah. Well he tried.

244
00:15:01,941 --> 00:15:03,710
I do believe he pitched it to somebody.

245
00:15:03,711 --> 00:15:05,630
I can't remember whether
it was network or not,

246
00:15:05,631 --> 00:15:10,190
but it definitely found its home
where it landed. AMC, right?

247
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:14,930
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Meanwhile, nobody had
watched anything on that network before.

248
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:18,020
There was no like one show that
everybody tuned into on that network,

249
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:22,370
but some network did turn him down for
that. Imagine being those executives like,

250
00:15:22,371 --> 00:15:27,360
oh gosh, I wonder if that's true. I
wonder if they did turn it down. No,

251
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:29,990
I know. I know for a fact. I
can't remember which channel,

252
00:15:29,991 --> 00:15:34,670
but somebody turned down breaking bad
originally. Vince Gilligan pitched it.

253
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:39,700
I can't remember whether it was
network or or Fox or FX or something,

254
00:15:40,671 --> 00:15:45,260
but somebody turned that down.
Breaking bad. What a dummy. Yeah.

255
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:50,180
OOPS, big. Whoops. I'm watching the
show. The strain. Have you seen that?

256
00:15:50,181 --> 00:15:54,050
That's the Benicio del Toro not been.
He showed delta are where?

257
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:57,290
Mo Del Toro,
a production of a,

258
00:15:57,291 --> 00:16:00,320
it's a book that he wrote with this
Guy Chuck Hogan, some vampire book,

259
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:03,800
but it's super fucking gory.
Like really fucking gory.

260
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:07,550
And when I'm watching it like that,
like along with walking dead,

261
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:11,450
which is obviously really gory too, you
could never have those. I'm like NBC.

262
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:15,780
They would, they would, they would have a
shit fit. Right. But you still have NBC,

263
00:16:15,781 --> 00:16:17,660
you still have CBS,
you still have ABC.

264
00:16:17,661 --> 00:16:20,390
There's people that still
want to watch those sitcoms.

265
00:16:20,391 --> 00:16:23,570
Like they still have a hold
on a certain type of show.

266
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,900
Like especially like network sitcoms.
Like that's their shit.

267
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:31,890
Those like those cameras, sitcoms
where they have an audience, you know?

268
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,980
Well those are the channels now networks,

269
00:16:33,981 --> 00:16:36,470
just the channel that
like people put on in,

270
00:16:36,471 --> 00:16:41,030
leave on and fall asleep and walk around
the house with that on. It's not really,

271
00:16:41,031 --> 00:16:45,190
like know, there's no real passion
behind me. Like NBC. Yeah, yeah,

272
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:47,980
yeah. It's um, I don't want,

273
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,400
I wonder what they could do because it
seems like there's just too many options.

274
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:54,410
If you had to like a regular night.
I mean,

275
00:16:54,411 --> 00:16:57,770
imagine if you had like ABC before the
Internet and you watched this thing come

276
00:16:57,771 --> 00:17:01,610
along and then you watch all these cable
companies come along and put you on ABC

277
00:17:01,611 --> 00:17:04,340
in 1980 and you just,
you know,

278
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,960
chilling on a fucking yacht out there
in the middle of the Pacific smoking

279
00:17:08,961 --> 00:17:11,240
cigars saying,
we've got an made.

280
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:14,360
This fucking business is locked down,

281
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:18,650
and then all of sudden this creepy thing
called cable comes around this table,

282
00:17:18,651 --> 00:17:22,460
but things were never going to take off.
They can swear. What can they swear?

283
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:26,360
That's the thing called the FCC, right?
Yeah. That's what people don't know.

284
00:17:26,361 --> 00:17:28,220
They could do whatever they want on cable.

285
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:31,760
That's why comedy central has
uncensored content late at night.

286
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:33,710
If you tune in to comedy
central late at night,

287
00:17:33,711 --> 00:17:37,640
you'll hear all sorts of terrible
language. They can do that shit.

288
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:41,030
And if by terrible you mean awesome.
I mean terrible.

289
00:17:41,031 --> 00:17:43,790
If you're a fucking square.
Yeah.

290
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:45,380
There's a lot of those out
there that aren't there.

291
00:17:45,381 --> 00:17:49,100
That's the other thing with the
networks and the sitcoms, a laugh track.

292
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:53,850
Nothing drives me crazier than hearing.
Even if it's a live studio audience,

293
00:17:53,851 --> 00:17:56,730
it's just, I don't want to hear people
laugh. Don't tell me when the laugh,

294
00:17:56,790 --> 00:18:00,840
I don't want to name the big bang
without the laugh track. No. Yeah,

295
00:18:00,841 --> 00:18:04,830
there's videos on the big bang
without the laugh track and

296
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:11,010
it's fucking confusing.
Well this makes more sense.

297
00:18:11,011 --> 00:18:14,400
At least you know when you listen to
people not laughing, you go, okay,

298
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:16,530
well that's much more likely.
Right?

299
00:18:16,531 --> 00:18:19,560
But it also could be in their defense,

300
00:18:19,561 --> 00:18:23,400
it could be like second and third
takes like the second and third take.

301
00:18:23,401 --> 00:18:27,170
Like audiences don't fucking laugh.
I mean they laugh a little like ah,

302
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:31,080
but sometimes you have to do a line
like four or five times to get it right.

303
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:35,370
Or there might be a camera issue or there
might be a sound issue and they have

304
00:18:35,371 --> 00:18:39,210
to repeat a scene. So when you're doing
a sitcom in front of a live audience,

305
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:44,490
there's oftentimes many takes, like we
used to fucking beat the audiences up.

306
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:46,500
Oh, it was awful. The poor people,

307
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:50,820
they would sit there and in the crowd
during the news radio days and if

308
00:18:50,821 --> 00:18:53,940
something wasn't working like they
had to do it a couple of times.

309
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:58,440
Like there was times when an episode
didn't go well where it got like three,

310
00:18:58,441 --> 00:19:02,520
four takes in a row. But when we would
get like first take or second take,

311
00:19:02,521 --> 00:19:06,080
like we always do a second take but we
do first taking second take and they're

312
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:07,650
like we got it. I'd be like, oh my God.

313
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:12,570
Cause was third takes are brutal cause
he knew that you were wearing on people's

314
00:19:12,571 --> 00:19:16,140
patients. Like the audience had
to sit there and like, oh my God,

315
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:18,360
okay we're going to do it again folks.
And you hear the audience go,

316
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:21,390
Oh oh no.

317
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:24,630
But in this video it's more just
horrible writing and horrible jokes.

318
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,990
It's pretty bad. But you
want to play it. Yeah,

319
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,260
I think we'll get pulled off of youtube,
but I think that's the theme lately.

320
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:36,360
Hot again, the big bang. These people
all just got 1 million bucks in episode.

321
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:40,560
Good for them. Good for them.
I have no, no problem with
that. I think it's amazing,

322
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:46,350
but the show sucks. It's fucking
terrible. They can't help but suck.

323
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:47,400
They're trying to suck.

324
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:50,820
They're trying to Anne and I
don't mean suck for some people.

325
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,180
See that's the thing about suck with
sucks for you is what other people are

326
00:19:54,181 --> 00:19:57,360
looking for. And that's not
hard for people to recognize.

327
00:19:57,510 --> 00:20:00,480
Like everyone wants everyone else
to have their own sensibilities.

328
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:03,450
When I say that something sucks,
someone else might come along and say,

329
00:20:03,451 --> 00:20:07,440
that's my favorite shit.
Like when I was bear hunting up in Alaska,

330
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:09,180
I had a hangup or up in Canada,

331
00:20:09,181 --> 00:20:12,140
I had to hang out with all these people
that love country music and they've

332
00:20:12,141 --> 00:20:15,510
watched the country music channel,
the rivets, the best folks ever,

333
00:20:15,511 --> 00:20:18,770
the nicest people ever. And um, they,

334
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:22,470
they play this fucking
country music shit all day.

335
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:27,750
And some of it is just mind numbing.
Just it's so,

336
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:32,100
it's just so dumb and it's,
it's not just dumb.

337
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:36,840
It's like they're appealing to like
the dumbest part of your brain,

338
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:39,840
like the part of your brain that wants
everything to be a Norman Rockwell

339
00:20:39,841 --> 00:20:44,841
painting the part of your
brain that doesn't want
subtlety or nuance thinking or

340
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:48,100
it's the introduced at all the concept
that you're actually on a fucking

341
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:51,940
planet flying through the universe.
All those concepts are like,

342
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:56,470
there's none of that, you
know? Yeah. And we'll,

343
00:20:56,471 --> 00:21:01,471
when we were young and wild and we got
married and had a child and all good.

344
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:10,810
Jesus is with us all the time.
Fuck you.

345
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,480
I just got a text. They want to make you
the newest country. Sorry. I can do it.

346
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:18,430
I can do it. Hey brought away.
How good was fucking dumb.
My rares music yesterday.

347
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:22,960
Oh, that was amazing. Dom Irrera has good
fucking music. Yeah. Dom still in music.

348
00:21:22,961 --> 00:21:26,940
Dom, I rare raw, wrote a good fucking
song and I'm not bullshitting.

349
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:29,470
I'm going to get them to email
me that shit. Yeah. Here's that.

350
00:21:29,471 --> 00:21:32,920
Really get them to email it to me while
a cause. I don't think he has an online.

351
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:33,813
We go,

352
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:36,410
oh,
this is the big bang.

353
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:42,650
Nothing makes beer tastes better then
cool. Rocky mountain spring water.

354
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:48,420
Well, the rocky mountains
anywhere. Philadelphia.

355
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:53,370
Really? I thought they were out west
some place. Think about it, Raj.

356
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:55,680
Where did the movie rocky take place

357
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:00,360
for the Gulf? Yeah. Okay, now I get it.

358
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:04,480
Oh, this is the plan. From now on.

359
00:22:04,481 --> 00:22:06,820
We're just going to hide out
in here to avoid the shaming.

360
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:10,980
I am very comfortable here. Penny. Joe,

361
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:15,650
why don't you shoot another silver
bullet my way. I have one yourself.

362
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:18,580
Somebody who's been ticking bitchy pill.

363
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:20,020
Okay,

364
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:24,910
this is bad for America. Stop this
right here. This is bad for America.

365
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:28,510
That's not just bad. That's bad for
the world. That's bad for the country.

366
00:22:28,511 --> 00:22:30,510
That's bad.
That's bad for him.

367
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:34,510
Right, and that's all riding in somebody.
Each thinking. That's funny, right?

368
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:39,660
That got through every script
supervisor and meeting and pitch.

369
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:44,070
I lighters the best of the best.
That's all the desks, ideas,

370
00:22:45,810 --> 00:22:49,530
nothing on NBC and all these
guys want to really survive.

371
00:22:49,531 --> 00:22:53,550
They're going to have to have like an
NBC cable or an app where NBC can make

372
00:22:53,551 --> 00:22:58,080
programming that's more adult like they
do on cable or that NBC is just going to

373
00:22:58,081 --> 00:22:59,820
become an APP.
When that does happen,

374
00:22:59,821 --> 00:23:02,540
and it's not like cable and
network's not going to mean the same.

375
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:04,290
See,
I think you're saying that,

376
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:08,580
but I think the people that listened to
some of that dopey ass country music,

377
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,940
those people don't have an issue with it.
There's,

378
00:23:11,941 --> 00:23:15,600
there's certain people that will tell
you, big bangs, my favorite show. Yeah,

379
00:23:15,601 --> 00:23:16,710
that's a good show.

380
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:19,860
Jordy isn't like that.
That's not right.

381
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:24,590
That's why breaking bags or
HBO or showtime is getting
better ratings than anyone

382
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:27,770
did. Not. You're wrong.
You're wrong. You're wrong.

383
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:32,240
The numbers that watch breaking bad or
not nearly the numbers that watched the

384
00:23:32,241 --> 00:23:35,960
big bang, it's not even close. Really?
Yeah. It's not even in the ballpark.

385
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,350
It's true. They only had like that, dude.
You gotta know what you're talking about.

386
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:42,410
That's not true. It is
getting, they're getting great.

387
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:46,370
They do well because they're awesome.
They're and people find them,

388
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:47,750
but they're on table.

389
00:23:47,751 --> 00:23:52,751
It's way more difficult to get someone
to watch a show say on AMC or a show on,

390
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:57,530
you know, any one of those. The history
channel, it's, it's very difficult.

391
00:23:57,531 --> 00:24:02,330
That's why when the duck
dynasty show got insane ratings,

392
00:24:02,331 --> 00:24:07,280
they got like some crazy number, like
9 million or 7 million people to watch.

393
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:09,590
It was the highest rated cable show ever.

394
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:14,980
That's not even close to what those big
bang kids get that that's like an 18

395
00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:16,580
million people a week show

396
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:17,540
they went in every week.

397
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:22,570
Sometimes the second number two of the
week is a rerun of that first show that

398
00:24:23,541 --> 00:24:27,740
they're number one on. Sometimes a big
bang rerun can beat everything on TV.

399
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:31,750
What's going on is that they're trying
to trick dumb people and the thing,

400
00:24:31,751 --> 00:24:32,321
and they're smart,

401
00:24:32,321 --> 00:24:35,680
but watch it and nerdy show they've
made a nerdy show for dumb people.

402
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:38,620
Like they've hijacked to markets.
Yeah.

403
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:42,310
They've hijacked the people that
want to be smart and you know,

404
00:24:42,311 --> 00:24:45,520
and the wanting to be nerds and then
they've also got the dumb people.

405
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:50,290
They've got both markets. It's really a
lot of dumb people. Mostly dumpy. Yeah.

406
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:55,360
Yeah. Break that breaks more ratings.
Records. Yeah, but this is a guarantee.

407
00:24:55,361 --> 00:24:59,560
That's an old article because breaking
bad canceled and the duck dynasty things

408
00:24:59,561 --> 00:25:03,640
post that and the duck dynasty thing
got the highest ratings ever is 2013 but

409
00:25:03,641 --> 00:25:06,430
yeah, I mean the numbers,
but what's the numbers

410
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:10,570
pulled a 6.6 million,
right.

411
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:13,060
That's a fail for.
If that was,

412
00:25:13,061 --> 00:25:17,830
if that was happening with the big bang,
they would be terrified.

413
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:22,760
Yeah. It's crazy what they brought and
trust me, I know what I'm talking about,

414
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:24,800
not just making this up.
I'm just saying that the,

415
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:29,820
the cable channels aren't getting great
ratings occasionally for for shows like

416
00:25:30,641 --> 00:25:34,960
breaking bad. They do much better than
they used to do, but they're still,

417
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:38,770
they pale in comparison to the major
network shows. For whatever reason,

418
00:25:39,010 --> 00:25:42,790
those really dumb shows still
get the best ratings. Like, yeah,

419
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:46,900
like game of Thrones is a
different example because
it's a subscription channel

420
00:25:47,050 --> 00:25:50,260
and it's got far less people
tune into it like he used to be.

421
00:25:50,261 --> 00:25:54,220
If you got an HBO special, that
was the shit. All my God, you know,

422
00:25:54,221 --> 00:25:58,870
we saw that Sam Kinison, Hbo
Special, the Chris Rock, HBO special,

423
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:02,980
but now a comedy central special is
way better than an HBO special cause a

424
00:26:02,981 --> 00:26:06,640
comedy central special is going
to be seen by way more people,

425
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:09,730
millions more people and then on top of
that they're going to replay the shit

426
00:26:09,731 --> 00:26:10,480
out of it because they,

427
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,870
that's all they play is comedy
and people go there for comedy.

428
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:15,370
But like the numbers,

429
00:26:15,371 --> 00:26:19,270
like if you look at the numbers like
you would think that like the soprano's

430
00:26:19,271 --> 00:26:22,060
like well it must have been an
unbelievably high rated show.

431
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:26,860
It was for HBO but not compared to like
the big bang or compared to friends,

432
00:26:26,861 --> 00:26:29,800
right.
Friends was on top or be all that stuff.

433
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:32,820
It's just amazing that those
things are still, that's,

434
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:36,130
those things are still viable and I
wonder what events always going to be the

435
00:26:36,131 --> 00:26:39,280
case if there's always going
to be people who like bland,

436
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:44,340
like really easy to
swallow humor like sitcommy

437
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:45,060
humor.

438
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:48,630
I think that generation is
going to die out. I really do.

439
00:26:48,631 --> 00:26:53,430
I know it's just like a fading thing and
even that thing about like the network

440
00:26:53,431 --> 00:26:56,160
App, I think the people that
were re that really, really,

441
00:26:56,161 --> 00:27:00,510
really are into that type of stuff though
it's going to be 10 more years before

442
00:27:00,511 --> 00:27:01,950
they even know what an APP is.

443
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:06,360
Apple TV I think has going and those
kind of network TVs I think are going to

444
00:27:06,361 --> 00:27:08,790
really change the thing.
Everything like the iPhone,

445
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:11,590
if they make it so that some they,

446
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:14,700
they can't get directly to
one of those three channels.

447
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:18,030
If they show them other ways,
then yeah,

448
00:27:18,031 --> 00:27:22,890
but these people that watch network TV
or probably just always watch network TV,

449
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:26,250
they're used to a laugh track. They
need that. Yeah, I think so too.

450
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:30,540
I remember a part of Man on the moon
where it's a Andy Kaufman played by Jim

451
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:32,310
Carrey talking to his manager,
George Shapiro,

452
00:27:32,311 --> 00:27:36,960
played by Danny Devito and he and Danny
Devito is his manager and he goes,

453
00:27:36,961 --> 00:27:39,180
I got you the best Gig, Andy,
you're going to love it,

454
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:42,210
and this is in the 70s or whatever. And
Andy's like, great, what is it? He goes,

455
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:45,480
sit-com taxi. It's going to be
huge. You're going to love it.

456
00:27:45,481 --> 00:27:50,460
And he goes a sitcom with a laugh track.
All those dead people laughing,

457
00:27:50,461 --> 00:27:52,650
you know, those are dead
people. That's the worst stuff.

458
00:27:52,651 --> 00:27:55,440
That stuff's not funny
and it's amazing to me.

459
00:27:55,740 --> 00:28:00,660
You know that he was saying that at the
end of the seventies and it's still,

460
00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:04,350
it's 2014 and people are still
watching stuff like that.

461
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:06,700
It's funny that you say it
because I was watching this.

462
00:28:06,701 --> 00:28:08,980
I'm a hunter s Thompson
documentary the other night.

463
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:13,750
I just put it on while I was
cleaning my office. And um, it's,

464
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:16,910
it's from the BBC. The BBC did a, um, uh,

465
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:21,460
a piece on him and um, oh, I'll
tell you what it is right here.

466
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:25,180
Oh, actually I don't have it on this. Um,

467
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:28,720
anyway,
it was,

468
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:33,990
it was very pocalypse pick like his take
on society and America where America is

469
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:38,170
headed. And this is in the early
seventies. They did this thing,

470
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:41,350
maybe the late seventies at the,
at the very latest wasn't the 80s though.

471
00:28:42,910 --> 00:28:47,500
You know, you're, you're watching
this guy who's now committed suicide.

472
00:28:47,501 --> 00:28:49,240
He's dead brilliant writer.

473
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:54,190
Who's seeing the shift from the 60s to
the 70s and he's saying that America is

474
00:28:54,191 --> 00:28:57,310
just going downhill.
We become this fascist,

475
00:28:57,340 --> 00:29:02,080
ridiculous state and our, our,
our culture is eroding and that,

476
00:29:03,130 --> 00:29:06,490
you know, within, you know, 10, 20
years it's going to be over for us.

477
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,980
And now here we are, 2014, you know,

478
00:29:08,981 --> 00:29:13,360
30 plus years later and everybody's still
kind of saying the same shit. You know,

479
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:16,930
everybody's still kind of
saying, you know, hey, it's
all, it's all falling apart.

480
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:21,250
Hey Arc, I'll culturals disastrous.
It's, it's doom and gloom always.

481
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:26,260
I think that what's going
on is that there's always
going to be a certain amount.

482
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:30,640
What does this fear and loathing and
on the road to Hollywood's at the BBC

483
00:29:30,641 --> 00:29:32,770
documentary. Yeah. Okay. Um,

484
00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:36,310
I think there's always going
to be a certain amount of, uh,

485
00:29:36,311 --> 00:29:39,880
of people that think that the
world is ending. Sky's falling,

486
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:42,070
and there's going to be
a certain of bullshit

487
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:43,360
that goes on always.

488
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:47,140
There's always going to be people trying
to correct for all the evils of the

489
00:29:47,141 --> 00:29:50,340
world,
whether it's war or crime or this or that.

490
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:53,050
There's always going to be that and
then there's always going to be like an

491
00:29:53,051 --> 00:29:58,051
adjustment period where you know you have
like a bunch of police brutality cases

492
00:29:58,631 --> 00:30:02,380
and then someone figures out a way to a
stop the police from behaving that way

493
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:03,131
and then you know,

494
00:30:03,131 --> 00:30:07,810
things get better or is it going to be
like horrible war and then people protest

495
00:30:07,811 --> 00:30:11,230
the horrible war and then it gets better.
It's just,

496
00:30:11,231 --> 00:30:15,490
it seems like these ideas that it's all
gonna fall apart and society is going to

497
00:30:15,491 --> 00:30:17,920
collapse.
Like I think all that shit happened,

498
00:30:17,921 --> 00:30:20,980
the society collapsing back when people
didn't understand the society could

499
00:30:20,981 --> 00:30:25,600
collapse and now we have so much detailed
history on like what it takes for a

500
00:30:25,601 --> 00:30:28,300
society to become like
Rome when Rome fell,

501
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:31,100
what it takes for a society to become,
you know,

502
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:36,120
like one of these archetypal societies
that people talk about when the,

503
00:30:36,131 --> 00:30:38,590
you know, the ancient Greeks
or the Romans or any of these.

504
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:43,030
When you talk about like a society that
was on top of everything had all of

505
00:30:43,031 --> 00:30:47,230
these scholars and all these
intelligent people and then collapsed.

506
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:48,813
Yeah.

507
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:52,030
It's going to be interesting to see what
the next big one like that is because

508
00:30:52,031 --> 00:30:56,620
it's going to have technology and robots
and a whole bunch of crazy stuff like

509
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:59,800
way down the road,
but there's going to be some crazy stuff

510
00:31:00,210 --> 00:31:03,250
you saw him far away. Yeah. I
think the technology, robots,

511
00:31:03,251 --> 00:31:06,370
all that shit like we're where things
are going to be so much weirder than the

512
00:31:06,371 --> 00:31:08,740
art. Today's going to
happen so fast. You know?

513
00:31:08,741 --> 00:31:12,040
If you listen to like Ray
Kurzweil and these futurists guys,

514
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,330
their take on it is always so enlightening
because everybody wants to think of

515
00:31:16,331 --> 00:31:18,280
it as like,
you know,

516
00:31:18,281 --> 00:31:22,810
when we were kids we had
VCRs and now we have Netflix.

517
00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:24,370
What a jump,
what a leap.

518
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:27,970
But the leap really has been
within the past few years,

519
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:32,260
the past few years has been bigger
leaps and they were from the VCR to the

520
00:31:32,261 --> 00:31:34,690
Internet.
Like did the delete you getting crazier?

521
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:39,070
There's a fucking app that they came out
with for Google face or Google a Google

522
00:31:39,071 --> 00:31:43,630
glasses that recognizes
your moods. Whoa. Yeah.

523
00:31:43,631 --> 00:31:47,860
What it recognizes your fucking mood.
Like, if I come up to you with this,

524
00:31:47,861 --> 00:31:50,770
Google, Google, I can't
even say Google glass.

525
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,900
I'm just gonna call it Google glass.

526
00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:57,220
If I come up to you with this app
installed and wearing Google glasses,

527
00:31:57,221 --> 00:32:00,430
it tells me if you're happy. It
tells me if you're angry, let's,

528
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:05,290
it analyzes your face. Interesting.
That's creepy as shit man.

529
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:06,500
Pull that up.
Pull it up.

530
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:09,970
Lot of cameras have something like
that already built in with the smile

531
00:32:09,971 --> 00:32:10,570
detection.

532
00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:13,150
Like where are you pointing a camera and
it will take a picture when it detects

533
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:16,360
that you're smiling. Oh, okay.

534
00:32:16,361 --> 00:32:18,670
But that's not breeding like mood.

535
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,950
It's just detecting a certain
movement of your face.

536
00:32:21,130 --> 00:32:25,600
This fucking stupid thing is actually
trying to like look at someone's face and

537
00:32:25,601 --> 00:32:26,290
decide,

538
00:32:26,290 --> 00:32:30,760
you know that gross thing that really
cheesy dude's due to chicks or they go,

539
00:32:30,761 --> 00:32:32,530
hey,
it doesn't hurt to smile.

540
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:37,780
You know it actually a more muscles are
involved in frowning here and smiling.

541
00:32:37,781 --> 00:32:39,980
It takes more energy to frown.
Does a smile,

542
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:44,030
hey, you know why not smile? You
know that thing, that gross thing,

543
00:32:44,031 --> 00:32:45,200
that dude's due to checks.

544
00:32:45,201 --> 00:32:49,040
Have you ever seen a guy do that makes
you fucking embarrassed to be a man? Yeah.

545
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:51,020
That's going to be way more commonplace.

546
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:53,870
People are going to be doing that
all the time. My Google glass is,

547
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:57,990
recognizes you're not in the best mood
right now. He, uh, my Google glass,

548
00:32:57,991 --> 00:33:01,990
it says you're depressed. Do you
need a hug? Cause I'm here. You know,

549
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:05,400
just take a chance. I'm a
good guy. Did, uh, did, uh,

550
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:08,900
you were wearing Google glasses
or are you just happy to see me?

551
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:14,810
It's totally wrong.
You got it the wrong way.

552
00:33:16,890 --> 00:33:17,540
What is this?

553
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:22,540
A video that Google glass on Google
glass did take the information behind.

554
00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:26,920
See this for the first time.

555
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:33,090
We'll give the zooming up.
Don't frown.

556
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:35,800
Hoofers proprietary
shore software library.

557
00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:40,690
Let's have a look at how it works.
Sure.

558
00:33:40,691 --> 00:33:45,050
Process is high resolution video
in real time on the glass CPU.

559
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:47,780
Does it only work on nerdy checks,

560
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:54,380
emotions or do detection?
Oh my God.

561
00:33:54,690 --> 00:33:55,640
In addition to that,

562
00:33:55,641 --> 00:34:00,641
it does age and gender recognition and
age estimation and gender recognition.

563
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:06,350
What if you're a like a really
good looking older transsexual man,

564
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,390
you think it'll get you

565
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:14,780
at the time of this Beta.
This has only worked on white people.

566
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:20,110
That is a beautiful old man.
Sure is not limited to a single phase,

567
00:34:21,390 --> 00:34:24,680
uh, angry hipster or respect
other people's privacy.

568
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:29,750
There is no recognition of milestones
and none of the images leaves the device.

569
00:34:30,350 --> 00:34:34,550
Fuck you. It doesn't, but that's
not all our short technology can do.

570
00:34:34,551 --> 00:34:37,360
Even more helpful things not
shown in this demonstration.

571
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:44,750
Valance recognition for
very subtle reactions. Whoa.

572
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:50,000
Head pose estimation. I blinked
detection. This was just a demo.

573
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:54,740
Okay. This one corner is not
available in an APP store.

574
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:59,720
This looks like a pirate and his hostage.
It's not available in an APP store.

575
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:04,880
What does that mean? It's now maybe now
available. Not Ready yet. Not Ready. Oh,

576
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:08,140
it might be bullshit.
And that might've been just like a,

577
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:12,320
like we might've gotten fucking pranked.
You know,

578
00:35:12,950 --> 00:35:16,430
it says it's not available to an
APP store cause it seems so fake.

579
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:19,190
If I saw that years ago,

580
00:35:19,191 --> 00:35:22,010
I would say that's total bullshit
because that technology was so good.

581
00:35:22,090 --> 00:35:26,170
Alien I the idea of it.
But now after the Google glass thing,

582
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:28,720
you might not be able to
tell by the smile on my face,

583
00:35:28,721 --> 00:35:31,060
but I'd be really disappointed
if that's not real.

584
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,030
That's the thing is like it can't really,

585
00:35:34,031 --> 00:35:38,610
it's just seeing if your mouth moves
side to side and like it's frowning,

586
00:35:38,850 --> 00:35:39,990
but some people,
you know,

587
00:35:39,991 --> 00:35:44,760
some people cry happy tears and some
people smile when they're furious.

588
00:35:45,090 --> 00:35:46,590
Yeah, exactly. Yeah.

589
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:51,980
He's super happy joking with this guy.
You're looking at Ted Bundys car,

590
00:35:52,370 --> 00:35:56,760
nice car
that's been barred.

591
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:01,000
It's full.
A happy good cheekbones guys smiling.

592
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:04,320
Got a clown mask door. Doesn't
have an inside handle. Yeah.

593
00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:07,860
Oh he's got a knife in his tank.
I'm sure that's for cutting birthday cake.

594
00:36:07,861 --> 00:36:09,840
He's a happy guy.
Duct tape.

595
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:13,360
Weird.

596
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:15,670
But one day they're going to get really
good at it to the point where there will

597
00:36:15,671 --> 00:36:16,600
be able to detect.

598
00:36:17,350 --> 00:36:20,110
It's going to really be able to
show you gonna be able to detect,

599
00:36:20,290 --> 00:36:22,570
not just that you're going to be
able to detect people's thoughts,

600
00:36:22,571 --> 00:36:24,310
like it's going to start out with moods,

601
00:36:24,610 --> 00:36:28,540
but eventually you're going to be able
to see like graphic representations and

602
00:36:28,541 --> 00:36:30,570
what a person's thinking.
You'll be able to tune that.

603
00:36:30,571 --> 00:36:33,850
They'll be able to figure out. I think
the way they're going to have to do it is,

604
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:37,920
I've been thinking about
this a lot. You know how, um,

605
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:41,470
there was no cameras and then they
became cameras. Like when we were young,

606
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:46,210
there was no way that you could ever
imagine that someone was going to carry

607
00:36:46,211 --> 00:36:49,900
around a camera all the time like that.
You wouldn't think of that.

608
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:50,771
You saw a camera,

609
00:36:50,771 --> 00:36:54,430
it was around someone's waist or someone's
neck router and they'd have to hold

610
00:36:54,431 --> 00:36:55,600
it up and take that picture.

611
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:59,170
It wasn't just simply like this
little phone thing that were going on.

612
00:36:59,171 --> 00:37:00,640
Now that's a big leap.
The,

613
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:04,720
the big leap of having cameras
in your pocket at all times.

614
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:10,060
Um, and if you went back before
the invention of the camera,

615
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:13,300
if you went way, way
back to like, you know,

616
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:17,590
back in the days when there was just
paintings and drawings and things along

617
00:37:17,591 --> 00:37:18,424
those lines,

618
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:22,360
they could have never imagined that
you'd be able to make video from a little

619
00:37:22,361 --> 00:37:24,710
tiny slender device that
you stick in your pocket.

620
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:30,120
You read the devil if you showed them
that and now this phone that you can take

621
00:37:30,671 --> 00:37:34,630
video with and go online with and take
photographs now it's become a part of you.

622
00:37:34,690 --> 00:37:38,200
It's become a part of who you are.
It's like it's a symbiotic thing.

623
00:37:38,201 --> 00:37:41,290
You keep it with you.
You'd never leave the house without it.

624
00:37:41,410 --> 00:37:42,580
When you do you freak out.

625
00:37:43,090 --> 00:37:46,750
I think they're going to come up with
something that stores your memory better

626
00:37:46,751 --> 00:37:50,050
than you do.
Are they going to say we have in,

627
00:37:50,090 --> 00:37:53,020
it'll probably be like an addition,

628
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:57,940
like an upgrade to the human
memory banks. I come here, we have,

629
00:37:58,190 --> 00:37:59,440
yeah,
like a memory card.

630
00:37:59,441 --> 00:38:04,441
But that did shows you crystal
clear video of what you saw.

631
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:09,970
So like, you know how if you had to pull
like yesterday out of your memory banks,

632
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:14,410
he'd be like, ah, fuck, what
did I do? What did I do? What
did I do? Okay, I got up, I,

633
00:38:14,411 --> 00:38:17,620
this is what I had for breakfast. But
it's all blurry as fuck. Right, right.

634
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:20,650
They're going to be able to get
it so that it's exact, well,

635
00:38:20,651 --> 00:38:23,080
you'll be able to rewind and play it back

636
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:26,320
Google glasses,
what did I do yesterday at 1245 right.

637
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:31,620
And then you're gonna be able to
share that with other people. Yeah.

638
00:38:31,850 --> 00:38:33,120
You're going to be able to share your day.

639
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:35,980
What I'm wondering is,
is if it'll ever to the point to where

640
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,960
we're paying for our privacy.
You know,

641
00:38:37,961 --> 00:38:40,960
like once everything's all
wired in and you had the,

642
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:43,181
you know,

643
00:38:43,181 --> 00:38:46,930
once your Google glasses or in a cloud
with what you looked up on the Internet

644
00:38:46,931 --> 00:38:50,800
that day and you're walking by somebody
with Google glasses and you know what I

645
00:38:50,801 --> 00:38:52,810
mean?
Like they walk by and it's like,

646
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:56,620
you know a bubble pops up over their head
and you know this guy was looking at,

647
00:38:57,230 --> 00:39:01,660
you know yeah double
anal clown porn earlier.

648
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:05,350
It's like whoa that's stranger was
looking at clown porn. That's crazy.

649
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:09,880
But like if they paid $10 a month or
something that other people wouldn't be

650
00:39:09,881 --> 00:39:11,890
able to know what they know.

651
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:14,830
Like I'm wondering how fast and
how far it's really going to go.

652
00:39:14,831 --> 00:39:16,060
Cause I think about it a lot too.

653
00:39:16,061 --> 00:39:19,630
Cause I love pot and I think there's
something about pot that makes you love

654
00:39:19,631 --> 00:39:24,220
thinking about the future.
Especially technology cause
I mean it's all happening.

655
00:39:24,221 --> 00:39:29,221
It's so weird and privacy and phone
calls and things backed up can know

656
00:39:29,351 --> 00:39:31,930
everything. You can find out
everything about somebody,

657
00:39:31,931 --> 00:39:34,080
their daily habits every time.

658
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:37,370
Gina's thing about the cell phone towers
that they don't believe or really cell

659
00:39:37,371 --> 00:39:39,440
phone towers,
their cell phone,

660
00:39:39,470 --> 00:39:43,400
their cell phone towers that they've
located that don't seem to be transmitting

661
00:39:43,401 --> 00:39:46,220
cell phone data and they've
gone to them with like these,

662
00:39:46,370 --> 00:39:50,300
these devices that try to read and what
they think is going on is the cell phone

663
00:39:50,301 --> 00:39:54,590
towers are actually tapping into phone
calls and recording your information.

664
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:59,600
Like say if the police want to find out
where Tony Hinchcliffe is right now and

665
00:39:59,601 --> 00:40:04,220
you know you could use the gps on the
phone and find out that he's on the four

666
00:40:04,221 --> 00:40:08,420
oh five and he's headed
to San Diego and you know,

667
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:09,860
and then they go,
okay,

668
00:40:09,890 --> 00:40:14,330
we're going to tap into his phone so
they can tune in through that tower and

669
00:40:14,331 --> 00:40:17,210
listened to your phone calls. You're
like, I got the fucking heroin.

670
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:19,310
The dude's off duct taped in the trunk.

671
00:40:19,370 --> 00:40:22,610
I've got 15 different
handguns that are all illegal.

672
00:40:22,611 --> 00:40:24,110
Everyone's laughing on
the other end. We, you,

673
00:40:24,170 --> 00:40:27,530
the cops are listening to the entire
conversation. Like they can do that. Yeah.

674
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:31,080
There was a terror I that just went
up in my backyard the other day,

675
00:40:31,081 --> 00:40:33,750
like out of nowhere,
there was no construction out of nowhere.

676
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:39,020
Tia. Yeah, black helicopters. They've
been doing this Brian for a long time.

677
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:39,740
That was

678
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:44,000
fun getting to meet him and it has two
antennas on the top like that looked like

679
00:40:44,001 --> 00:40:46,160
wifi antennas.
You can't see him in this picture.

680
00:40:46,161 --> 00:40:50,150
But then there's a solar panel and
we have our uh, overhead lines,

681
00:40:50,151 --> 00:40:52,850
power lines in our neighborhood.
So there's like, you know,

682
00:40:52,930 --> 00:40:55,700
they're above ground and
there's no power going to it.

683
00:40:55,701 --> 00:41:00,290
So that means this is whatever this is
is just running on a solar and it has

684
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:02,510
antennas and like a weird
box on the side of it.

685
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:03,790
It's probably nothing.
Yeah,

686
00:41:03,850 --> 00:41:06,880
probably like what you mean
you're freaking out about it.

687
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:09,580
Why don't you just find out what it
is? Yeah, I bet it has a number on it.

688
00:41:09,581 --> 00:41:11,200
You can call or something. No, it doesn't.

689
00:41:13,870 --> 00:41:17,530
For reading problems. Go here. Did you
try to research what it is now? I mean,

690
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:19,450
why don't you take a photo of
it and put it up on Twitter?

691
00:41:19,451 --> 00:41:21,460
Take that picture and what they say.
What did people say?

692
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:24,110
People are pointing towards this,
that article.

693
00:41:25,130 --> 00:41:26,840
That's the only thing that
people have been saying.

694
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:29,780
Yeah, but see, people do
that when they, you know,

695
00:41:29,781 --> 00:41:33,050
if you don't really know what the fuck
it is. I might be that though. Yeah. Who?

696
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:34,070
I didn't,
I'm not even

697
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:34,670
saying it to that.

698
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:37,190
I'm just saying it was really odd because
one day it was there, one day will,

699
00:41:37,191 --> 00:41:40,340
it wasn't and it was just like
in my neighbor's backyard.

700
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:41,630
I wonder if they can do that.

701
00:41:41,631 --> 00:41:45,710
Can you take a cell phone tower and
attach it to an electrical pole or does it

702
00:41:45,711 --> 00:41:50,330
have to have it's own stand alone
sort of thing? I would think that,

703
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:51,620
I don't know anything about it,

704
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:56,300
but I would think that the
s the electricity would
maybe fuck with it all that,

705
00:41:58,190 --> 00:42:01,670
all that power going through those lines.
If they don't let us turn on,

706
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:04,670
if they make us turn off our cell phones
when the plane's about to take off,

707
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:08,150
I don't think they could put a cell
phone tower on it. Yeah, but that's a,

708
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:11,690
that's a stupid thing. That whole
turn off your electronic devices.

709
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:13,070
That's all been disproven now.

710
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:17,870
So that's why everybody's allowed to use
like iPods and shit and iPads right up

711
00:42:17,871 --> 00:42:22,220
until the time you land. But you're
still not allowed to use Bluetooth.

712
00:42:22,490 --> 00:42:24,110
Like if you have those Bluetooth headsets,

713
00:42:24,111 --> 00:42:26,090
like there was a dude in front of
me on the airplane the other day.

714
00:42:26,330 --> 00:42:30,230
He had the Bluetooth headset and a,
they told him he couldn't have it on.

715
00:42:30,290 --> 00:42:32,510
You couldn't have it on while the
plane because it could interfere with

716
00:42:32,511 --> 00:42:35,590
communications. Yeah, but
that's probably bullshit too.

717
00:42:35,770 --> 00:42:39,710
So they probably just don't know any
better and they just say it because they

718
00:42:39,711 --> 00:42:42,680
just want to tell you to shut something
off and they can't do that anymore.

719
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:44,300
I think it's awesome for planning things.

720
00:42:44,330 --> 00:42:47,720
So you can't have like a
Bluetooth headpiece and you're
sitting in the front row

721
00:42:47,721 --> 00:42:50,930
and I'm in the back row and we're all
kind of communicating like, hey, you know,

722
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:54,660
like terrorist stuff. Awesome. Do
they work like that? I don't know.

723
00:42:54,661 --> 00:42:58,040
That seems like that wouldn't you if you
had to communicate with somebody else

724
00:42:58,041 --> 00:43:02,480
in the plane? Yeah, but a Bluetooth
headset, as far as I'm aware,

725
00:43:02,690 --> 00:43:05,810
all it does is communicate with
an actual device. Like a phone.

726
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:09,500
You'd have to be talking on the phone to
someone in the back of the plane. Yeah.

727
00:43:09,770 --> 00:43:13,030
I don't think you can communicate
through Bluetooth, can you? Yeah.

728
00:43:13,130 --> 00:43:15,890
I mean you can connect Bluetooth,
that Bluetooth and stuff like that,

729
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:20,210
but can you connect Bluetooth too?
Bluetooth and talk like if you had,

730
00:43:20,450 --> 00:43:23,990
I don't think so, man. I think you need
some sort of a transmission device.

731
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:27,890
I think like if you had a Bluetooth head
set on it and I had a Bluetooth headset

732
00:43:27,891 --> 00:43:30,800
on, we couldn't just connect our
headsets and communicate with each other.

733
00:43:31,010 --> 00:43:35,330
We would have to do it through a device.
Right. I don't know how that Bluetooth,

734
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:40,310
Jamie, I've never had one. I'm no, no
either. Well, even if you couldn't,

735
00:43:40,370 --> 00:43:44,840
you'd probably will be able to write and
within a year or so they'll figure it

736
00:43:44,841 --> 00:43:48,640
out. It's all happening so God damn fast.
Oh yeah. There's, it looks like, yeah,

737
00:43:48,650 --> 00:43:52,400
there's Bluetooth headset, walkie talkies
on Amazon. Oh, it's a walkie talkie.

738
00:43:52,430 --> 00:43:54,860
And it's like just in a little
earpiece in your ear. That's it.

739
00:43:54,861 --> 00:43:59,360
That's the whole device. Whoa. Whoa.

740
00:43:59,361 --> 00:44:03,740
That's what, that's scary. Check this out.
Uh Oh shit. I gotta get your video up.

741
00:44:04,310 --> 00:44:08,470
Uh, like a heavy small
wireless and visible earpiece.

742
00:44:08,810 --> 00:44:12,650
G A Bluetooth earpiece. Wow.
That looks like an actual tooth.

743
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:16,010
Well that's when someone can talk to
you through a walkie talkie though.

744
00:44:16,011 --> 00:44:19,340
I use those when I was on fear factor,
they've had those forever.

745
00:44:19,341 --> 00:44:23,690
They used to use radios and now now
they use Bluetooth. But all that is,

746
00:44:23,691 --> 00:44:27,500
is allowing you to talk. You have to
have a walkie talkie on you, on you.

747
00:44:27,650 --> 00:44:29,360
And it connects to the walkie talkie.

748
00:44:29,361 --> 00:44:32,030
Mine used to connect with
a radio frequency. I'd

749
00:44:32,030 --> 00:44:34,560
wear like a backpack,
like a battery pack rather.

750
00:44:34,561 --> 00:44:38,310
The slow communication pack
and it would work that way.

751
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:41,610
But someone else on the other end
had to have a communication device.

752
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:44,210
They had a walkie talkie and they were
talking through that and it would go to

753
00:44:44,211 --> 00:44:48,750
directly to me and I couldn't talk to
them except for the fact that I was

754
00:44:48,751 --> 00:44:53,070
hardwired with a microphone that also
had a radio frequency that went to a box.

755
00:44:53,071 --> 00:44:54,240
And the box,
there was a guy,

756
00:44:54,241 --> 00:44:57,540
there was a sound guy that was there
and it would go through them and through

757
00:44:57,541 --> 00:44:59,670
their, uh, through their speakers.

758
00:44:59,970 --> 00:45:04,950
But it was like the entire
cast was wired up, so all,

759
00:45:04,951 --> 00:45:07,620
and you could turn each
microphone on or off,

760
00:45:07,770 --> 00:45:09,870
but that requires a lot of equipment.
You know,

761
00:45:09,871 --> 00:45:11,610
you've got a lot of different
shit going on there.

762
00:45:12,150 --> 00:45:16,110
What I'm saying is if someone has a
Bluetooth headset on just a Bluetooth

763
00:45:16,111 --> 00:45:18,270
headset,
if they don't have a phone that's on,

764
00:45:18,390 --> 00:45:21,570
you're not talking to somebody and you
can't really talk to somebody on a phone

765
00:45:21,571 --> 00:45:22,560
when you're on an airplane.

766
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:26,430
Here's a, here's the one. It
looks like you can do it. It's a,

767
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:30,910
it looks like a walkie talkie thing and
it says that it has a two way walkie

768
00:45:30,911 --> 00:45:35,560
talkie. Whoa. For 84,000 feet. Whoa. Oh,

769
00:45:35,561 --> 00:45:37,350
so they're basically saying
that's what it does. Yeah.

770
00:45:37,540 --> 00:45:40,030
Who makes that one tooth call?

771
00:45:40,031 --> 00:45:43,210
pod.com onyx looks like call pod.

772
00:45:44,230 --> 00:45:48,160
The onyx is the name of that. I'm just
saying that, but that is a walkie talkie.

773
00:45:48,161 --> 00:45:52,420
Yeah. That might be something that
it already does exist. Wow. Yeah.

774
00:45:52,421 --> 00:45:57,080
That's crazy. It's insane
because Bluetooth already
makes people look crazy. What?

775
00:45:58,010 --> 00:46:01,690
Yeah, would they have radios? Yeah.
Yeah. These are walkie talkies.

776
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:05,560
What we're saying is that this little
thing that that person had in their ear,

777
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:08,860
that that itself is a walkie talkie.
That's fucking nuts.

778
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:13,330
That's that little one to how far that
transmits though, because Bluetooth,

779
00:46:13,331 --> 00:46:16,690
the Bluetooth, you can't really
communicate very far. Eight 84,000 feet.

780
00:46:16,810 --> 00:46:20,260
That's in the air. They're saying,
does that mean distance? No,

781
00:46:20,261 --> 00:46:22,900
they don't mean in the air. Planes
don't get that high. That's space.

782
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:29,400
That's like three times what a plane goes
as the square feet square feet 84,000

783
00:46:29,530 --> 00:46:33,310
oh, so, okay, so it transmits 84,000 feet.

784
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:36,100
30,000 feet is a flight,

785
00:46:36,790 --> 00:46:41,110
so 84,000 feet is like more than a mile.
How many thousand feet is a mile?

786
00:46:41,111 --> 00:46:45,700
Five thousand five thousand feet in a
mile, right. Damn. That's pretty insane.

787
00:46:45,820 --> 00:46:50,820
So you could be like essentially down
at Jerry's Deli having a meal and I can

788
00:46:51,221 --> 00:46:55,630
talk to you in real time through
these goofy ass. We should buy these.

789
00:46:57,640 --> 00:47:02,210
That's so crazy. What is the
company name again? Call pod. Uh,

790
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:05,380
that's where I think that's I,
that's where it's sold. It's Onyx.

791
00:47:05,410 --> 00:47:08,900
O. N Y. X. Oh,

792
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:10,700
N y. X. Hmm.

793
00:47:14,250 --> 00:47:17,190
So it's like walkie talkies,
except you keep one in your ear,

794
00:47:17,250 --> 00:47:19,140
but how does it pick
up what you're saying?

795
00:47:19,950 --> 00:47:23,520
You just can roam up to 164 feet away.

796
00:47:24,030 --> 00:47:26,160
That's not that far.
When what happened?

797
00:47:26,161 --> 00:47:28,350
I thought we was miles from
your smartphone. That's for,

798
00:47:28,351 --> 00:47:30,010
so it has to have a smart phone. No, no.

799
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:32,080
That's just phrase it as,
that's just for smartphones.

800
00:47:32,110 --> 00:47:36,190
If you want to use it as a headset
for your smart phone. Yeah.

801
00:47:36,191 --> 00:47:40,300
This is what it says with our proprietary
two way walkie talkie functionality.

802
00:47:40,510 --> 00:47:43,930
You can also connect the
onyx to any other call Pod,

803
00:47:43,931 --> 00:47:48,931
Bluetooth headset and communicate up to
84,000 square feet while you were still

804
00:47:49,121 --> 00:47:53,710
connected to your mobile phone. Oh, you
have to be connected to your mobile phone.

805
00:47:54,290 --> 00:47:58,450
Hmm. I don't know. I'm not
sure. You can use Bluetooth.

806
00:47:59,140 --> 00:47:59,351
Yeah,

807
00:47:59,351 --> 00:48:03,730
I'm not sure what this is saying that
you can connect to any other call Pod,

808
00:48:03,731 --> 00:48:08,731
Bluetooth headset and communicate up to
84,000 square feet while you are still

809
00:48:09,071 --> 00:48:10,600
connected to your mobile phone.

810
00:48:10,670 --> 00:48:14,660
It's just saying that you could still
use it and do the walkie talkie at the

811
00:48:14,661 --> 00:48:16,760
same time. Like if you're
still connected to your phone,

812
00:48:16,761 --> 00:48:18,050
you could still use it as the walk.

813
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:20,840
Right? Like you don't have
to disconnect. We, yeah,

814
00:48:20,841 --> 00:48:24,080
we got to find out if this really works.
All right. We're going to have to buy,

815
00:48:24,081 --> 00:48:28,850
these pitchers will buy them and
we'll, we'll broadcast like you.

816
00:48:29,210 --> 00:48:30,043
Can we do that?

817
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:33,470
I wonder if we could get it so that
we could put the earpiece up to the

818
00:48:33,471 --> 00:48:36,910
microphone and you could go out in the
parking lot and talk to us. Oh yeah.

819
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:40,100
Put it like right up there and
see if it works. Yeah, absolutely.

820
00:48:41,390 --> 00:48:42,950
Over you have to say over though.

821
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:48,390
Red Band over we got,
we got smoking in the Bush over,

822
00:48:51,070 --> 00:48:54,110
but it was all excited because they
have those fucking those stupid walkie

823
00:48:54,111 --> 00:48:58,440
talkie phones. Those are the dumbest
ever it goes to next tell those.

824
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:02,380
But everybody wanted them. They wanted
to be like fucking walkie talkie guy.

825
00:49:02,660 --> 00:49:05,960
When we were in high school,
we didn't have cell phones in our phones,

826
00:49:06,020 --> 00:49:11,020
so we all had a CB radios in our car
and we all had the humongous antennas on

827
00:49:11,031 --> 00:49:13,290
the topic of car.
Oh yeah.

828
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:16,790
But it was cool because we all live
within a couple miles of each other so we

829
00:49:16,791 --> 00:49:20,110
can just like use it as a cell phone
before there were cell phones and just to

830
00:49:20,111 --> 00:49:23,120
be driving around in our car being like,
where are you at? Where you want to go?

831
00:49:23,121 --> 00:49:25,970
Smoke some weed at the
church. Sure. You know? Wow.

832
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:30,860
You're probably all on police
frequencies. Yeah, totally. Totally. Yeah.

833
00:49:30,861 --> 00:49:34,580
We got the, I think two kids are
about to go smoke weed at a church.

834
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:38,650
Yup. Yeah. How about
those police scanners?

835
00:49:38,670 --> 00:49:41,180
You ever go over someone's house and they
got a police scanner going on all the

836
00:49:41,181 --> 00:49:43,580
time? I got one on my phone. I
listen to it all the time. Yeah.

837
00:49:43,581 --> 00:49:46,360
But I mean like those real ones that
people have in their home. Right.

838
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:49,400
Those are weird.
Just the domestic violence network.

839
00:49:49,430 --> 00:49:51,620
We have another beating.
Yeah.

840
00:49:52,090 --> 00:49:56,060
Which just something weird about people
that want to constantly be in tune with

841
00:49:56,061 --> 00:49:58,520
all the crime that's going on around them.
Yeah.

842
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:01,280
It's probably guys that like wanting to
be in the police force but couldn't pass

843
00:50:01,281 --> 00:50:04,520
the examinations. Oh Man. What's
that fire truck going by far?

844
00:50:04,810 --> 00:50:05,643
The figures,

845
00:50:06,180 --> 00:50:11,080
they know all these assholes in
my neighborhood are up to no good.

846
00:50:11,260 --> 00:50:14,830
I just saw an ambulance and I
need to know what's going on now.

847
00:50:15,910 --> 00:50:19,960
I do it sometimes like lists.
I think it's interesting.

848
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:25,650
Yeah. I mean, I guess so. Yeah. I mean
look, voyeurism like and you know,

849
00:50:25,660 --> 00:50:28,580
being able to rubberneck
right. Uh, crimes and stuff.

850
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:30,380
One of the things they're saying
is they're going to try to,

851
00:50:30,381 --> 00:50:34,100
in La they're going to try to raise
up the walls in between the two lanes,

852
00:50:34,430 --> 00:50:35,840
the north and the southbound lanes.

853
00:50:36,140 --> 00:50:40,070
She people rubber neck so much and it
causes so much traffic. Oh, it's insane.

854
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:40,880
Yeah.
It's,

855
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:44,870
it's really frustrating when you get
somewhere and you realize that the only

856
00:50:44,871 --> 00:50:48,110
reason why everyone drove slows cause
some shit went on the other side of the

857
00:50:48,111 --> 00:50:50,750
fucking highway,
like you fucking self

858
00:50:50,770 --> 00:50:54,640
for Chicago in the middle of the
highway then it should not slow us down.

859
00:50:54,850 --> 00:50:59,140
But everybody wants to see everybody
should just get CB radios and keep driving

860
00:50:59,141 --> 00:51:00,580
at 75 miles an hour.

861
00:51:01,490 --> 00:51:03,170
Yeah.
I don't think that's going to help.

862
00:51:03,580 --> 00:51:07,640
I know the only thing that's gonna help
ally as if it was like multiple layers.

863
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:10,670
Like we would need like
several layers of highways.

864
00:51:10,671 --> 00:51:14,030
Like you could drive up to the upper
highway if you really weren't scared of

865
00:51:14,031 --> 00:51:16,790
earthquakes. Yeah. Or if
you wanted to be on the top.

866
00:51:16,850 --> 00:51:17,990
So if the earthquake happened,

867
00:51:17,991 --> 00:51:21,530
you ride that bitch down at the
bottom and crush everybody below you.

868
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:26,050
Yeah. You know in Silicon Valley where
that one dude had a really skinny car,

869
00:51:26,051 --> 00:51:28,900
wears like a one person car.
He almost looked like a set piece of sand.

870
00:51:28,930 --> 00:51:31,900
Like a bread. I don't know what you're
talking about. Yes, I saw it. Yeah.

871
00:51:31,990 --> 00:51:32,591
It's like a,

872
00:51:32,591 --> 00:51:36,760
imagine if a car like a mini Cooper was
cut in half and make it himself now.

873
00:51:36,761 --> 00:51:39,310
It was just kind of a joke. Like that
guy is so rich and look at his car,

874
00:51:39,311 --> 00:51:42,880
how skinny it is. He's like, he's like
poverty bud. Want to listen to your idea?

875
00:51:42,881 --> 00:51:44,620
I'm Outta here.
And he gets in this tiny,

876
00:51:45,700 --> 00:51:49,360
cause it's silicone valley and it's all
just you talking about the TV show. Yeah.

877
00:51:49,510 --> 00:51:52,570
Oh Jesus Christ. Sorry. Yeah. But yeah,

878
00:51:52,750 --> 00:51:56,230
but what if we all had just one person
cars in the future? Whereas cars,

879
00:51:56,260 --> 00:51:58,180
motorcycles get to go in between cars.

880
00:51:58,181 --> 00:52:01,990
So what if we just had to like really
skinny cars? Yeah. That's a death trap.

881
00:52:02,430 --> 00:52:03,580
Yeah.
That's not good.

882
00:52:03,581 --> 00:52:06,630
That doesn't even a lot of room for
error if somebody hits you. Yeah.

883
00:52:06,690 --> 00:52:08,440
That's the thing that
everybody's looking at. Like,

884
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:12,750
like when when you see a Volvo
guaranteed there's a pussy in that car.

885
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:16,290
Someone in there. I was like
terrified of crashes. That's just,

886
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:18,180
that's just how it is with Volvos.

887
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:22,290
Got a six star safety rating and
I just can't get hit out here.

888
00:52:22,590 --> 00:52:27,250
Well Joey Diaz drives a Volvo did the
best fucking car you've ever going to have

889
00:52:28,260 --> 00:52:32,160
like the Volvo too. So there it
goes. My theory, my theory sucks,

890
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:34,980
but so many of those people
that do drive those things,

891
00:52:34,981 --> 00:52:36,590
so like super safety conscious because of,

892
00:52:36,610 --> 00:52:39,270
that's one of the things that all
their commercials were geared to. Yeah.

893
00:52:39,271 --> 00:52:41,910
This is a boring ass car.
Yeah, yeah. Yes. Not Fast,

894
00:52:42,090 --> 00:52:45,180
but look what happens when you
throw it off a cliff. Boom.

895
00:52:45,181 --> 00:52:49,350
Nothing like they build those things
to like withstand nuclear blasts.

896
00:52:49,850 --> 00:52:52,140
Like you know,
if you got one of those,

897
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:55,920
you're not going to eat that
shit in for a fucking motorcycle.

898
00:52:56,010 --> 00:52:59,310
Super Safe. They only go 45
miles an hour. But it's so sad.

899
00:52:59,810 --> 00:53:02,330
Well they go normal speeds now.
They're pretty fast cars.

900
00:53:02,570 --> 00:53:06,170
I mean there's not much difference
when you get to like the high end cars.

901
00:53:06,171 --> 00:53:06,651
I mean there's,

902
00:53:06,651 --> 00:53:10,550
there's a difference as far as like one
of them handles more comfortably but

903
00:53:10,630 --> 00:53:14,780
they're modern cars are so god damn good.
There's so much better.

904
00:53:15,140 --> 00:53:17,930
Like that car that we had
in Denver that a Hellcat,

905
00:53:18,350 --> 00:53:23,030
that's a 707 horsepower American car,
ridiculous car.

906
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:25,980
That was unheard 20

907
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:27,350
years ago.
I did literally,

908
00:53:27,630 --> 00:53:30,540
I literally grew chest hair
while sitting in that thing.

909
00:53:30,541 --> 00:53:33,990
Like some people use that as a figure of
speech. Like, oh put hair on my chest.

910
00:53:33,991 --> 00:53:37,560
Like I looked at in the hotel room when
I was showering after that and I had

911
00:53:37,561 --> 00:53:41,430
more chest hair.
It's three times the car I've ever been in

912
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:46,220
that sound.
But the point is like that didn't exist.

913
00:53:46,221 --> 00:53:47,540
It wasn't even possible.

914
00:53:48,020 --> 00:53:52,310
Like when you've got a really fast car
from 1970 and I had like 400 horsepower

915
00:53:52,610 --> 00:53:57,260
and it was just a death trap. Terrible
breaks. No handling. It was like a,

916
00:53:57,261 --> 00:53:59,060
an elephant on roller skates.

917
00:53:59,330 --> 00:54:03,440
I mean that's what it was like just about
every way you was plowing into shit.

918
00:54:03,470 --> 00:54:08,030
Barely able to stop.
The cars today are just infinitely better.

919
00:54:08,150 --> 00:54:12,260
So if you took a Volvo of today,
which you consider like a super safe car,

920
00:54:12,261 --> 00:54:16,400
very boring, and took it around a race
track with like a 1970 challenger,

921
00:54:16,401 --> 00:54:20,960
it would bury that car and we just fucking
run circles around it and breaking,

922
00:54:20,961 --> 00:54:23,840
handling everything. And
he'd be like, Whoa Volvos,

923
00:54:23,841 --> 00:54:25,700
the greatest fucking hot rod ever.

924
00:54:26,030 --> 00:54:29,240
No it's just old cars sucked
a fat one old cars, you just,

925
00:54:29,270 --> 00:54:32,000
they're just clunky ass shitty technology.

926
00:54:32,050 --> 00:54:35,200
That Hellcat challenger.
It's 700 horsepower,

927
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:39,730
700 that means that like the equivalent
of that back in the day would be a

928
00:54:39,731 --> 00:54:44,731
carriage being pulled by 700 horses and
just the one guy in this care in the

929
00:54:45,131 --> 00:54:46,690
pack it says hello.

930
00:54:46,990 --> 00:54:51,040
But not even that because if you did
have a carriage pulled by 700 horses and

931
00:54:51,041 --> 00:54:54,370
right next to it you had a challenge
or the challenge of the fucking blow by

932
00:54:54,371 --> 00:54:57,240
that cause it would

933
00:54:57,650 --> 00:55:00,630
gone. It wouldn't even
be close. It, I mean,

934
00:55:00,650 --> 00:55:04,610
wouldn't let the race would last as much
time as it takes for the challenge to

935
00:55:04,611 --> 00:55:09,110
drive past the horses. That's it. Once
it got to the 700 horse, it's gone.

936
00:55:10,310 --> 00:55:14,090
Yeah. I Dunno. Understand horsepower
cause some horses are bigger too. Yeah.

937
00:55:14,780 --> 00:55:18,680
Some horses. Anything to do with
horses really. I think originally,

938
00:55:18,740 --> 00:55:19,820
well let's find out.

939
00:55:20,580 --> 00:55:24,740
Like I'd imagine a horse is
one horsepower, right? Yeah.

940
00:55:24,741 --> 00:55:28,790
But like some horses win the Kentucky
Derby and other ones fall in or fat stupid

941
00:55:28,791 --> 00:55:29,624
faces.

942
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:33,030
Surprised they don't have that for
other things. Like how a bicycle,

943
00:55:33,031 --> 00:55:34,500
how many cat power is that?

944
00:55:35,020 --> 00:55:37,840
Well, I was thinking, man, that's the
other place that we got to do a podcast.

945
00:55:37,900 --> 00:55:41,300
We got to do a podcast
from the Kentucky Derby in,

946
00:55:41,301 --> 00:55:45,510
in reference to a hunters Thompson is
one of his greatest books that awards

947
00:55:45,550 --> 00:55:48,850
greatest pieces was the Kentucky
Derby is decadent and depraved.

948
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:51,190
It's fucking great.
Great piece.

949
00:55:51,460 --> 00:55:55,090
Where it's like you went to the
Kentucky Derby and then, you know,

950
00:55:55,091 --> 00:55:59,710
like was essentially there were
mocking all the people that were there.

951
00:55:59,860 --> 00:56:03,640
You know, he was, uh, categorizing all
the monsters that were there, but the,

952
00:56:03,641 --> 00:56:06,300
by the end of the piece, he realized
he was one of them. You know,

953
00:56:06,310 --> 00:56:09,610
they're all fucked up and they're at
the Kentucky Derby. They realize like,

954
00:56:09,611 --> 00:56:13,780
we're no better than any of these savages
that are here. Measurements of power,

955
00:56:13,810 --> 00:56:18,790
horsepower. It's a unit of measurement
of power. The rate of which work is done.

956
00:56:18,790 --> 00:56:20,980
The most common conversion factor,

957
00:56:20,981 --> 00:56:25,981
especially for electrical
power is one equals 746 watts.

958
00:56:26,890 --> 00:56:31,890
The term was adopted in the late 18th
century by Scottish engineer James Watt to

959
00:56:32,561 --> 00:56:37,330
compare the output of steam engines
with the power of draft horses. Huh.

960
00:56:38,230 --> 00:56:42,700
It was later expanded to include the
output power of other types of piston

961
00:56:42,701 --> 00:56:46,660
engines as well as turbines,
electric motors and other machinery.

962
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:51,160
The definition of the unit varied
between geographical regions.

963
00:56:51,670 --> 00:56:52,630
Hmm.
That's interesting.

964
00:56:52,870 --> 00:56:57,870
Most countries now use the s I unit watt
for the measurement of power with the

965
00:56:58,571 --> 00:57:03,030
implementation of the EU directive.
Bubba Bubba, blah, blah, blah. Huh.

966
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:08,210
That's interesting. In the, in
the EU, the European Union, uh,

967
00:57:08,230 --> 00:57:12,280
the use of horsepower is only
permitted as a supplementary unit.

968
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:15,130
Like when you look at cars, um, you know,

969
00:57:15,131 --> 00:57:17,470
like if you look at an American
car for 700 horsepower,

970
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:20,920
well 700 horses under the truck
or under the, under the hood.

971
00:57:21,310 --> 00:57:25,000
If you look at European cars,
like on European a websites,

972
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:29,470
they have it listed as like,
like watts and kilowatts of power.

973
00:57:29,770 --> 00:57:32,980
It's really kind of
weird like a Land Rover,

974
00:57:32,981 --> 00:57:35,560
here's perfect one because
it's an English company.

975
00:57:37,150 --> 00:57:37,430
Okay.

976
00:57:37,430 --> 00:57:40,010
If you go to their, uh, their, uh,

977
00:57:41,190 --> 00:57:41,720
okay.

978
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:46,340
They're a website and you
read what they have. It's a,

979
00:57:46,370 --> 00:57:48,200
it's really kind of interesting.
Like you,

980
00:57:48,250 --> 00:57:52,490
you try to make sense of like what is
a watt, how much is in that, you know,

981
00:57:52,491 --> 00:57:57,200
like what does like a land rover defenders
like their version of like a jeep,

982
00:57:57,770 --> 00:58:00,770
like dimensions and capabilities,
engine and performance here.

983
00:58:03,020 --> 00:58:07,640
Yeah. Engine speed. At maximum torque.
They have torque Newton meters.

984
00:58:08,180 --> 00:58:11,510
Like it doesn't say horsepower.
The power and kilowatts,

985
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:16,960
kilowatts kw slash p s I thought kilowatts
was just a back to the future thing.

986
00:58:18,050 --> 00:58:21,850
I know that's chicken box that
senescence Vanessa say it didn't

987
00:58:23,630 --> 00:58:24,770
Land Rover defender,

988
00:58:24,771 --> 00:58:29,771
which is like their version of the
jeep has a 90 kilowatt one 22 p s uh,

989
00:58:32,390 --> 00:58:35,240
power rating.
So that's how they do in England.

990
00:58:35,630 --> 00:58:36,463
Hmm.

991
00:58:36,900 --> 00:58:39,690
They hate America. Yeah.
That's what's going on.

992
00:58:40,230 --> 00:58:42,810
She didn't know horsepower sounds
better. You Silly Brits. Yeah,

993
00:58:43,170 --> 00:58:46,410
because whenever you like read
about a Ferrari or a Porsche,

994
00:58:46,710 --> 00:58:50,790
it's always in horsepower, right?
Silly Fox. Yeah, the European Union.

995
00:58:51,780 --> 00:58:54,870
What,
what we go by the watt system.

996
00:58:55,380 --> 00:58:59,190
But it is a smarter way to do it.
Really kilowatts. Colas. It is.

997
00:58:59,191 --> 00:59:02,460
Why do you think we do it that way too?
I mean it makes sense.

998
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:07,140
What the fuck is a horse doing?
Being measuring cards.

999
00:59:07,141 --> 00:59:12,080
So American, it's so good.
How many power or horses is,

1000
00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:18,570
yeah, we're going to be as fuck. We really
are. We're so goofy with inches too.

1001
00:59:18,750 --> 00:59:19,710
Like when I was a kid,

1002
00:59:19,711 --> 00:59:23,810
they legitimately tried to introduce the
metric system to schools and I remember

1003
00:59:23,820 --> 00:59:27,920
pm people being like, fuck off,
throwing their rollers at the teacher.

1004
00:59:27,980 --> 00:59:31,880
They were just not buy it. Man.
That was in my lifetime. I saw it,

1005
00:59:31,881 --> 00:59:35,360
they were trying to introduce the metric
system just like they were trying to

1006
00:59:35,361 --> 00:59:39,740
introduce soccer. I was like very similar.
It was like, and people were like, Nah,

1007
00:59:40,220 --> 00:59:44,360
no, not having it. The metric
system though is so much better.

1008
00:59:44,420 --> 00:59:45,740
It's everything is intense.

1009
00:59:45,770 --> 00:59:49,700
It makes sense when we do fights
and other countries in England,

1010
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:52,730
England is the weirdest
cause they still go by stone.

1011
00:59:53,660 --> 00:59:55,730
Do you know what a stone is? What? Yeah.

1012
00:59:55,731 --> 00:59:59,810
If you were being measured
to be stands 11 stone.

1013
01:00:00,290 --> 01:00:03,170
Yeah. How much is astounding? I Dunno.

1014
01:00:03,380 --> 01:00:05,510
Why would they do stones
and not horsepower?

1015
01:00:05,511 --> 01:00:08,660
I mean horses are pretty much
are a lot closer than Stellan.

1016
01:00:08,661 --> 01:00:10,130
Sometimes there's a huge stone.

1017
01:00:10,250 --> 01:00:14,270
I think a stone is like 14
pounds or 13 pounds. Dude,

1018
01:00:14,271 --> 01:00:18,770
I'm only like six stones.
Okay.

1019
01:00:18,771 --> 01:00:21,440
In many north western European countries,

1020
01:00:21,441 --> 01:00:26,441
the stone was formerly used for trade
with a value ranging from about five to 40

1021
01:00:27,381 --> 01:00:28,520
local pounds.

1022
01:00:28,790 --> 01:00:33,170
With the advent of metrication
from the mid 19th century on,

1023
01:00:33,380 --> 01:00:37,310
it was superseded by the kilogram and
remained in limited use for trade in the

1024
01:00:37,311 --> 01:00:41,150
United Kingdom and in Ireland
until prohibited by the weights.

1025
01:00:41,210 --> 01:00:45,520
And measures act of 1985 but okay.
Yeah,

1026
01:00:45,640 --> 01:00:46,670
it's 14 pounds.

1027
01:00:46,940 --> 01:00:51,940
But they still use it for like weighing
in fighters when fighters way in this

1028
01:00:52,420 --> 01:00:57,350
Bruce Beth say that? Yes. Oh yeah. Well he
doesn't say it. He doesn't really say it.

1029
01:00:57,351 --> 01:01:00,680
I actually say it. The guy says it
to me, the guy, I'll say it to me,

1030
01:01:00,681 --> 01:01:05,210
you know 14 stone, but when Bruce Buffer.
Oh, okay. That's right. That's string way.

1031
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:07,160
Bruce buffer does say it though.

1032
01:01:07,370 --> 01:01:12,200
When they not sure if he still
does, if there's an actual, um,

1033
01:01:12,260 --> 01:01:16,370
during the actual like fight announcement,
but at the way in,

1034
01:01:16,550 --> 01:01:21,210
I would have to say it. Wow. I would
have to say like one stone, 10 pounds,

1035
01:01:21,270 --> 01:01:25,010
you know, one 55, you
know, x amount of stones.

1036
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:30,110
What does that 10 stone like?
Not quite 11 stone.

1037
01:01:31,360 --> 01:01:35,090
This fucking so strange.
10 stone,

1038
01:01:35,240 --> 01:01:40,220
nine pounds. And he'd say shit like
that. Wow. That is a weird unit.

1039
01:01:40,250 --> 01:01:42,080
They stopped doing that
after a while though.

1040
01:01:42,081 --> 01:01:44,810
And they had me just read off the weights.
Like I don't,

1041
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:46,550
I don't read the kilos anymore either.

1042
01:01:47,180 --> 01:01:50,950
Like if someone says one 55 it's
one 55 like it's, this is like,

1043
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:55,940
it's too confusing for American fans.
86 kilos shit. Can we get to a computer?

1044
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:56,930
You should start guessing.

1045
01:01:56,931 --> 01:02:01,931
The fighters horsepower announcing
that weighing in at six stone and 140

1046
01:02:03,951 --> 01:02:08,210
horsepower. You know what's interesting
is that it, that's kind of silly,

1047
01:02:08,211 --> 01:02:12,530
but it's true in fact that the
guys with the more horsepower,

1048
01:02:12,890 --> 01:02:17,240
they run out of gas quicker because it's
very relative. Yeah, they like muscle.

1049
01:02:17,241 --> 01:02:18,470
The plants,
how to get there,

1050
01:02:18,870 --> 01:02:22,440
like there's a certain
amount of horsepower you
need and then after that it's

1051
01:02:22,441 --> 01:02:24,780
kind of ridiculous.
It's like you're seeing with a race car,

1052
01:02:24,781 --> 01:02:29,640
like if you have a car and it's a gt car,
like if you're going around like a,

1053
01:02:29,700 --> 01:02:33,300
like a Nurburg ring or something
like that, like a real windy course,

1054
01:02:33,301 --> 01:02:34,134
a lot of handling.

1055
01:02:34,350 --> 01:02:37,950
You don't necessarily want like a
thousand horsepower engine in your car.

1056
01:02:37,980 --> 01:02:41,550
You want as much engine as
your suspension can handle.

1057
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:45,870
And when it comes to like miles
per hour and miles per gallon,

1058
01:02:46,050 --> 01:02:48,630
you want like a balance between the two.
You want to,

1059
01:02:48,631 --> 01:02:53,070
we want an engine that produces plenty
of horsepower but not so much horsepower

1060
01:02:53,071 --> 01:02:55,950
that it burns up all your fuel in 30
minutes and you lose the race because

1061
01:02:55,951 --> 01:02:58,800
everybody keeps going and you're done.
You're out of gas.

1062
01:02:58,860 --> 01:03:02,580
That's true with the body to like,
can you see like some dude,

1063
01:03:02,581 --> 01:03:07,110
he's got this giant fucking massive
muscles. The reality is that shit is a,

1064
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:11,520
that's like a giant engine and a small
gas tank and there's no other way around

1065
01:03:11,521 --> 01:03:12,780
it.
That's how the human body is.

1066
01:03:12,781 --> 01:03:17,100
There's a balancing act going on so that
guy could get you if he get you quick,

1067
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:19,290
but if the shit gets
dragged into the third,

1068
01:03:19,291 --> 01:03:21,150
fourth and fifth rounds
I got might be toast.

1069
01:03:21,151 --> 01:03:22,770
He might have a goddamn
heart attack in there.

1070
01:03:23,250 --> 01:03:26,650
Do you ever find out what happened
to that guy's ribs from Saturday?

1071
01:03:26,740 --> 01:03:31,010
That Pot's guy up?
Is that like 17 punches in the rich?

1072
01:03:31,130 --> 01:03:34,320
Way More than that. Oh my
God. It was [inaudible] 67

1073
01:03:34,350 --> 01:03:38,530
then unanswered body shots. That's
what it was. Yeah. Oh my God.

1074
01:03:38,540 --> 01:03:41,540
Through all through bolt.
Two or three rounds,

1075
01:03:41,541 --> 01:03:43,640
whatever many rounds it was
the fight where it was stopped.

1076
01:03:43,750 --> 01:03:47,440
He kept covering his head but he left
his body open and I remember the guy just

1077
01:03:47,441 --> 01:03:49,860
kept hitting that same spot.
It was crazy.

1078
01:03:50,180 --> 01:03:53,930
Was very sloppy. Yeah. That was
not a good fight. I just, you know,

1079
01:03:53,931 --> 01:03:56,780
it's unfortunate but true
that the larger guys,

1080
01:03:56,781 --> 01:03:59,420
like a lot of the larger guys
like the skill level is just not,

1081
01:03:59,630 --> 01:04:04,630
does not compare and it's not because
like they're not capable of moving.

1082
01:04:05,361 --> 01:04:07,940
Right.
Cause like look at the way a guy like,

1083
01:04:08,680 --> 01:04:10,970
like a super athlete moves,
you know,

1084
01:04:10,971 --> 01:04:15,770
look at away like peanut pick,
pick your favorite basketball player.

1085
01:04:16,790 --> 01:04:20,390
Lebron James is probably the biggest
super athlete in the world. Right.

1086
01:04:20,490 --> 01:04:23,360
Look at the way that guy moves now.
If that guy was an MMA fighter,

1087
01:04:23,390 --> 01:04:26,690
do you think you would move like
those guys? No. He'd move like he is,

1088
01:04:26,691 --> 01:04:30,540
he has a super athlete. Those guys
like especially pots, it's just like,

1089
01:04:30,541 --> 01:04:35,120
it was real stiff and awkward. It was
just shitty technique. That's just not,

1090
01:04:35,780 --> 01:04:39,350
that's not indicative of what you
would expect from a high level athlete.

1091
01:04:40,010 --> 01:04:42,080
I think that was like the
real problem with that fight.

1092
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:43,340
It's just the other dude's good.
Yeah.

1093
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:45,020
Well the way that it would do you know,

1094
01:04:45,021 --> 01:04:48,800
the way that it finished was what blew my
mind. Yeah. I mean just watching a man,

1095
01:04:48,890 --> 01:04:53,330
a heavyweight take heavyweight shots to
the ribs and especially the same spot.

1096
01:04:53,331 --> 01:04:56,450
I was noticing when the guy's hand
would pick up and he'd wind up,

1097
01:04:56,451 --> 01:05:01,451
he would hit in that exact same little
square diameter that his fist was before

1098
01:05:01,730 --> 01:05:04,460
and I have all the stuff.
I've seen a live,

1099
01:05:04,850 --> 01:05:06,500
I don't think I've seen anything like that

1100
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:08,860
just because the guy did
a shit job of defending,

1101
01:05:08,861 --> 01:05:11,320
but Anthony Hamilton's a good fighter.
He's a very good fighter,

1102
01:05:11,321 --> 01:05:14,970
but it was his first fight.
It was his first UFC bout.

1103
01:05:15,100 --> 01:05:16,390
He moved so much better.

1104
01:05:16,391 --> 01:05:20,410
Like you could see the he moved like is
just the way he is able to physically

1105
01:05:20,411 --> 01:05:23,030
move back and forth.
That's a big thing with heavyweights.

1106
01:05:23,140 --> 01:05:25,360
Just how much athleticism did they have?

1107
01:05:25,490 --> 01:05:30,490
I mean how much of it is just sheer size
and bulk and horsepower and how much of

1108
01:05:31,061 --> 01:05:32,110
it is athleticism?

1109
01:05:32,530 --> 01:05:34,900
Yeah.
I've been watching it

1110
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:35,850
some pro wrestling.

1111
01:05:37,590 --> 01:05:40,010
He totally predicted what was
going to happen with this.

1112
01:05:40,011 --> 01:05:41,610
John seen a Brock Lesnar,

1113
01:05:42,270 --> 01:05:45,960
you knew the thing white out about it.
Brock Lesnar,

1114
01:05:46,350 --> 01:05:48,860
you played it out long
at advance perfectly.

1115
01:05:48,861 --> 01:05:50,460
He knew exactly how it
was going to go down.

1116
01:05:50,790 --> 01:05:53,640
And you're saying that it's
sets up something in the future?

1117
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:56,380
Oh yeah, absolutely. They offered
me a full time writing job.

1118
01:05:56,381 --> 01:05:59,050
I can talk about it now cause I'm
not getting it. I'm not doing it.

1119
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:03,520
But a couple months ago they offered
me a full time job to move to Stamford,

1120
01:06:03,521 --> 01:06:06,550
Connecticut. Yeah. After one
meeting at a meeting like this,

1121
01:06:06,551 --> 01:06:08,440
that was about an hour and a half.
At the end they go,

1122
01:06:08,820 --> 01:06:13,450
how would you feel about moving to
Stamford Connecticut for one year job with

1123
01:06:13,451 --> 01:06:16,180
the WWE writing hung the
creative side and I go,

1124
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:17,560
I'm going to have to think about that.

1125
01:06:17,980 --> 01:06:22,360
And it didn't pan out because I
didn't want to move to Stanford,

1126
01:06:22,361 --> 01:06:24,370
Connecticut and working nine to five.

1127
01:06:24,850 --> 01:06:27,430
Even those really good
money and everything, but

1128
01:06:28,020 --> 01:06:29,100
you would have to go to,

1129
01:06:29,101 --> 01:06:33,320
you drive to a la or drive to New
York rather still do spots. Yeah.

1130
01:06:33,590 --> 01:06:35,780
Which turns out it's
just a 45 minute drive,

1131
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:40,700
but the job is very grueling
than WWE thing. It's not,

1132
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:44,140
it's not like our TV comedy writing job.
It's like a,

1133
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:47,660
I'd have to answer to Vince Mcmahon
like Tony. Oh, what'd you do?

1134
01:06:47,661 --> 01:06:51,210
Get stoned before writing this ideal.
Do you think that's what it was? Sorry.

1135
01:06:51,950 --> 01:06:56,810
Probably. What would you say to him? Well,
if you want to say, yeah, I was still,

1136
01:06:56,811 --> 01:07:01,430
when I wrote all the great ideas that
you like, sir. Well, you have a point.

1137
01:07:01,820 --> 01:07:05,120
I think Vince would try to
get you on steroids. Um,

1138
01:07:05,540 --> 01:07:07,160
he'd probably get me
tried to get me to eat

1139
01:07:07,260 --> 01:07:12,260
beef every chance he gets brought
in and price in this from my ranch.

1140
01:07:12,920 --> 01:07:14,940
I shot this myself this morning.

1141
01:07:16,450 --> 01:07:21,220
Yeah. Well was it good money? Like
serious money. Super serious money. Wow.

1142
01:07:21,221 --> 01:07:25,240
Sanely serious money. You came
close. I was happy to get the offer.

1143
01:07:25,241 --> 01:07:27,700
I took it as a victory
and I love what I do.

1144
01:07:27,701 --> 01:07:31,120
I love what I'm doing and it might
be crazy. I'll never regret it.

1145
01:07:31,121 --> 01:07:33,950
You know what I mean? I think you regret
it right now. I'm looking into your eyes,

1146
01:07:33,951 --> 01:07:38,380
so no, no. It's kind of a dream job
for you. Yeah, sort of. But then again,

1147
01:07:38,381 --> 01:07:40,810
what I do is sort of a dream job too,

1148
01:07:40,811 --> 01:07:43,980
and giving up this dream job for
that dream job would be crazy.

1149
01:07:43,990 --> 01:07:45,660
You wouldn't have to give
up this dream job. Right.

1150
01:07:46,150 --> 01:07:51,120
I'm telling you it's a grueling,
creepy job. Unfortunately.
Trust me, if it was, if,

1151
01:07:51,121 --> 01:07:54,610
if the word on the streets was man
riding for the WWE is the coolest,

1152
01:07:54,611 --> 01:07:55,301
you can do anything.

1153
01:07:55,301 --> 01:07:57,820
I would have taken it and I would have
lived in New York and it would have been

1154
01:07:57,821 --> 01:07:58,211
amazing.

1155
01:07:58,211 --> 01:08:02,600
I would have traveled to Stanford 45
minutes every morning on a subway and

1156
01:08:03,170 --> 01:08:06,640
Dunnigan Stanford. He, yeah, it would have
been amazing and I would have had any,

1157
01:08:06,641 --> 01:08:10,480
I could've, it was stupid. The amount of
money. You don't want to live in Stanford.

1158
01:08:10,481 --> 01:08:13,330
You know what the problem with
Connecticut is? It's not really a state.

1159
01:08:13,740 --> 01:08:16,190
It is a state, but let's be
honest, ladies and gentlemen,

1160
01:08:16,330 --> 01:08:20,240
you, you live in a highway but she in
Boston? In New York. Yeah, absolutely.

1161
01:08:20,630 --> 01:08:23,480
It's like they put some houses on the
side of the highway and they call it a

1162
01:08:23,481 --> 01:08:25,790
town, but that's what's really
going on. There's nothing,

1163
01:08:25,791 --> 01:08:28,450
nothing's being done there and nuns
to be made there. What do you got?

1164
01:08:28,470 --> 01:08:31,820
You got the Glenn Beck show and the WWE.
That's your entire state economy.

1165
01:08:32,420 --> 01:08:34,670
Of course. There's some other things
I'm just fucking around. Don't get,

1166
01:08:35,150 --> 01:08:38,660
don't get all fucking all stanfordy on me.

1167
01:08:38,900 --> 01:08:43,040
Don't get like all attached and proud
of Connecticut, Connecticut pride.

1168
01:08:43,410 --> 01:08:48,020
We've got a fucking email, Joe
Connecticut pride. Connecticut sucks.

1169
01:08:48,050 --> 01:08:51,140
You know it sucks and I know it sucks.
There's some great houses there.

1170
01:08:51,141 --> 01:08:54,440
Some nice neighborhoods, crazy
neighbor. I have my friend Tommy Junior,

1171
01:08:54,441 --> 01:08:57,470
one of my best friends lives
in Connecticut. He tells
me it sucks. I trust him.

1172
01:08:58,790 --> 01:09:02,450
It's not a good spot. When I used to
drive there from Boston to New York,

1173
01:09:02,930 --> 01:09:07,580
I would always think like, why is, why
are people stopping here? Yeah, WWE.

1174
01:09:07,820 --> 01:09:09,350
But a lot of people like,
you know,

1175
01:09:09,351 --> 01:09:13,700
David Letterman lived in Connecticut
and drove into the city to do a show.

1176
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:19,130
That's how he did it. Yeah. But he's
like reclusive, you know, he likes being,

1177
01:09:19,131 --> 01:09:23,720
he needs to be away from everybody.
He's weird like that. And you're not.

1178
01:09:24,410 --> 01:09:28,160
You missed her outgoing and that
city partying it up at night,

1179
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:32,150
doing a little blow in the morning,
pep you up right before class for sure.

1180
01:09:32,151 --> 01:09:33,830
You know me show up on the campus.

1181
01:09:34,700 --> 01:09:39,470
Give Vince the paperwork that you
wrote on the plane over there. Tony,

1182
01:09:39,740 --> 01:09:42,140
this storyline makes zero sense.

1183
01:09:42,530 --> 01:09:45,020
What kind of storylines where you
plan it? Did you, I know you did.

1184
01:09:45,050 --> 01:09:46,760
I know you thought about it.
Absolutely.

1185
01:09:47,110 --> 01:09:51,140
Absolutely. I wrote a, I wrote a
great storyline where, you know,

1186
01:09:51,190 --> 01:09:54,340
Brock Lesnar and a,
in this past Wrestlemania,

1187
01:09:54,341 --> 01:09:59,260
he beat the undertaker. The undertaker's
had a streak at Wrestlemania.

1188
01:09:59,261 --> 01:10:01,390
He never loses at Wrestlemania.

1189
01:10:01,391 --> 01:10:05,350
He was 21 and zero all time
at Wrestlemania 21 years.

1190
01:10:05,380 --> 01:10:09,160
He had never lost in this match
against Brock Lesnar. It's Sorta,

1191
01:10:09,161 --> 01:10:13,170
it was sort of set up so everybody just
assumed the undertaker would win and

1192
01:10:13,171 --> 01:10:15,910
then in a stunning move,
Brock,

1193
01:10:15,911 --> 01:10:19,480
towards the end of it ends up beating
the undertaker for the three count.

1194
01:10:19,510 --> 01:10:23,140
You want to see something funny? Look
that up. Reaction shots of the audience.

1195
01:10:23,141 --> 01:10:27,400
Don't do that. Okay, but this audience
was stunned to people. Just so I know.

1196
01:10:27,401 --> 01:10:31,750
What else? Shots drawn that audience. A
fucking simple card trick. Oh, come on.

1197
01:10:31,751 --> 01:10:34,680
What are you talking about?
Code road.

1198
01:10:36,100 --> 01:10:40,120
Silly Shit. Okay. It's all
planned out. It's obvious.

1199
01:10:40,360 --> 01:10:44,200
It's not obvious. It's definitely not.
If it's planned out, why would it be?

1200
01:10:44,490 --> 01:10:49,320
It was going to happen. I know what's
going to happen. No, that's not the,

1201
01:10:50,040 --> 01:10:53,650
that's not the arena's. Not everybody
in the arena was offered a full time,

1202
01:10:53,651 --> 01:10:56,620
one year writing job with the,
they don't know what's going to happen.

1203
01:10:56,621 --> 01:10:59,710
You're an expert and pro wrestling
essentially. I've watched my whole,

1204
01:10:59,711 --> 01:11:02,830
it was sort of like my replacement for
not having a dad when I was a kid. Like,

1205
01:11:02,831 --> 01:11:04,450
I would just sit there and watch these,

1206
01:11:04,510 --> 01:11:09,030
these storylines and these guys
do all this crazy stuff and said,

1207
01:11:09,780 --> 01:11:12,010
well sure it was my dad replaced

1208
01:11:14,010 --> 01:11:16,740
superfly snuck. Oh, was
your dad pretty much?

1209
01:11:16,741 --> 01:11:18,600
Super Fly was one of the biggest things.

1210
01:11:18,601 --> 01:11:21,960
I mean that's what I was doing off of
couches and my tidy whities when I was a

1211
01:11:21,961 --> 01:11:25,290
tiny little boy, Bob Backlund.
I remember Bob Backlund,

1212
01:11:25,350 --> 01:11:30,000
the creator of the cross face chicken
wing, which is a great move man.

1213
01:11:30,150 --> 01:11:32,970
Fucking time you invest in this.
You should get paid by this.

1214
01:11:33,630 --> 01:11:38,400
Seriously considered seriously
consider taking that job? Uh, no.

1215
01:11:38,550 --> 01:11:43,170
I would say no to anybody else, but
you, you liked that shit so much.

1216
01:11:43,320 --> 01:11:45,000
You've always got those fucking books.

1217
01:11:45,240 --> 01:11:49,290
He reads books on the
business of pro wrestling.

1218
01:11:49,291 --> 01:11:52,110
We're on a fucking plane and I look over,

1219
01:11:52,710 --> 01:11:56,940
there's people reading self help books.
Some folks are reading novels.

1220
01:11:57,270 --> 01:12:01,910
Tony H is going to fucking
book the sex and politics.

1221
01:12:01,911 --> 01:12:06,450
Ex lives in headlocks the shoe
unauthorized bio of Vince Mcmahon.

1222
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:08,670
What the fuck are you doing?

1223
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:12,130
Reading awesomeness
about a guy who took a,

1224
01:12:12,131 --> 01:12:17,131
a joke of a show and turned it into a
billion dollar enterprise and wrote it all

1225
01:12:17,851 --> 01:12:21,300
himself and is the main, you should
read her book on pro wrestling. Dude,

1226
01:12:21,660 --> 01:12:24,690
you should write a book, a
love affair, pro wrestling.

1227
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:29,370
I love affair from Tony Hinchcliffe.
I was listening to, um, to,

1228
01:12:30,110 --> 01:12:33,390
uh, the opening Anthony Show, which is
no longer the European Anthony show. Now.

1229
01:12:33,391 --> 01:12:35,850
It's a oop with Jimmy Norton.

1230
01:12:35,940 --> 01:12:39,810
I don't know why don't they just call it
the opion Jimmy show, but whatever. Um,

1231
01:12:40,140 --> 01:12:43,830
they had this guy on and
uh, he's an author. He's,

1232
01:12:44,070 --> 01:12:47,520
he wrote that a card
movie with Kevin Spacey.

1233
01:12:47,790 --> 01:12:52,470
He's written a bunch of 'em, a
bunch of different, uh, uh, books.

1234
01:12:52,471 --> 01:12:56,800
His name is Ben Mazur,
Rich Mazza rich. And uh,

1235
01:12:56,820 --> 01:13:00,600
he was talking about Russian
oligarchs and about what happened,

1236
01:13:00,601 --> 01:13:03,130
what went down and Russia during like,
uh,

1237
01:13:03,150 --> 01:13:08,150
the fall of the Soviet Union
were seven to nine people,

1238
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:14,130
but soaked up 50% of
the economy of Russia.

1239
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:19,110
Yeah. Seven, seven or nine,
somewhere in that number.

1240
01:13:19,140 --> 01:13:24,030
Like no more than 10 people literally
had 50% of the Russian economy and they

1241
01:13:24,031 --> 01:13:25,080
were just killing each other.

1242
01:13:25,530 --> 01:13:28,290
They would like kill each other
and take over their businesses.

1243
01:13:28,350 --> 01:13:30,360
Like if you had a competitor
of like you were coke,

1244
01:13:30,550 --> 01:13:33,870
you would send your army over to kill
Pepsi and then you would just own Pepsi to

1245
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:38,460
wow. It's, it was the total
complete wild, wild west.

1246
01:13:38,461 --> 01:13:41,880
And I don't know if he's written a book
on this or he's gonna write a book on

1247
01:13:41,881 --> 01:13:46,710
this, but fucking amen. Listen to that
shit. I bet he has written a book on it.

1248
01:13:46,711 --> 01:13:51,711
I should find out what the book
is been as rich Ben Mezrich.

1249
01:13:52,260 --> 01:13:57,000
I wonder what the direction of the
economy and the trends in everything we're

1250
01:13:57,001 --> 01:14:01,800
before that exclusive group of people
took that over. Cause it's, you know,

1251
01:14:01,801 --> 01:14:06,630
it seems like we're sort of in a way,
heading that direction with our stuff.

1252
01:14:07,940 --> 01:14:12,100
The top whatever percent has
such a crazy of money compared

1253
01:14:12,100 --> 01:14:13,720
to the rest of everybody.

1254
01:14:13,780 --> 01:14:17,500
Yeah. Well it's close. You know,
were, were pretty bad. But, uh,

1255
01:14:17,510 --> 01:14:22,300
apparently it's nothing like Russia,
like the, these Russian oligarchs.

1256
01:14:23,440 --> 01:14:25,930
They just dominated.

1257
01:14:25,990 --> 01:14:30,730
They just figured out a way to completely
dominate the entire economy of a giant

1258
01:14:30,731 --> 01:14:34,720
country. I mean it's, it's listening
to him talk about, it was fascinating.

1259
01:14:35,020 --> 01:14:37,210
That shows different now
that Anthony's not there,

1260
01:14:37,510 --> 01:14:40,810
but Jimmy Norton is so fucking
interesting. Hysterical. And you know,

1261
01:14:40,811 --> 01:14:43,960
an obese doing a great job with it too.
It's still a great show.

1262
01:14:44,920 --> 01:14:49,900
This Guy Ben Mezrich was fascinating.
Fuck Russia man.

1263
01:14:49,901 --> 01:14:54,070
It's crazy. They were talking about Putin,
but what a gangster Putin had to be to,

1264
01:14:54,250 --> 01:14:58,930
to come back and lead the country
after he left. Like he led the country,

1265
01:14:58,990 --> 01:15:02,020
took off. Like they, they impose
some sort of a term limit,

1266
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:07,310
came back like no term limit in
buck. Oh, he's back again. He's,

1267
01:15:07,360 --> 01:15:09,340
this is a second time running the country.

1268
01:15:09,670 --> 01:15:13,630
Like he installed some sort of a puppet
dictator or a puppet leader when he was

1269
01:15:13,631 --> 01:15:18,580
gone and then came back and he's a
former KGB agent. Like what the fuck man.

1270
01:15:19,130 --> 01:15:20,630
You know,
there's a guy that,

1271
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:25,640
a professional wrestler named Marie
Seth that actually Putin on the don,

1272
01:15:25,641 --> 01:15:27,830
the mega tron and the Titan tron.
Uh,

1273
01:15:27,831 --> 01:15:32,540
every time he comes out and really
gets the crowd riled up. Mother Russia,

1274
01:15:32,570 --> 01:15:35,180
I promise I will defeat my victim for you.

1275
01:15:35,181 --> 01:15:36,910
And it gets the whole crowd to hate him.
And then I,

1276
01:15:37,390 --> 01:15:41,180
and then a guy comes out and uh,
he, it Rousseff usually wins.

1277
01:15:41,181 --> 01:15:43,880
They let the Russian guy when
cause it drives the crowd crazy.

1278
01:15:44,180 --> 01:15:46,280
And then you think anything
can happen after that.

1279
01:15:48,250 --> 01:15:53,250
I fuck my favorite thing is to
watch how you respond to me.

1280
01:15:53,961 --> 01:15:58,250
Talk About Russ, what's wrong with you?
You would love it and roll with you.

1281
01:15:58,670 --> 01:16:01,310
I wouldn't love it. You'd be
amazed. I'll bet you though.

1282
01:16:01,430 --> 01:16:06,430
I bet you if I showed you a
statistic of UFC fans being WWE fans,

1283
01:16:06,440 --> 01:16:09,950
I bet you'd be shocked because before
the UFC was all over everything.

1284
01:16:10,140 --> 01:16:12,410
And one of the only outlets that end,
by the way,

1285
01:16:12,411 --> 01:16:15,170
I've been with the UFC since the
beginning, you know what I mean?

1286
01:16:15,171 --> 01:16:17,600
Like I mean like watching
it since the hoist days,

1287
01:16:17,601 --> 01:16:21,930
since the voice and shamrock and all that.
And that's because it's,

1288
01:16:22,460 --> 01:16:26,290
even though it's two totally different
things, UFC is obviously an extremely,

1289
01:16:26,510 --> 01:16:27,343
you know,

1290
01:16:28,120 --> 01:16:33,120
crazy sport and WWE is
completely entertainment with
some injuries from time to

1291
01:16:34,331 --> 01:16:35,164
time.

1292
01:16:35,310 --> 01:16:36,940
Uh,
you know,

1293
01:16:37,100 --> 01:16:41,090
the, it was an outlet for anybody
that wanted some crazy stuff.

1294
01:16:42,170 --> 01:16:42,490
Okay.

1295
01:16:42,490 --> 01:16:45,070
Wwe and UFC fans.
I bet there's a lot.

1296
01:16:45,250 --> 01:16:48,960
I would bet you that I'm just going to
wait till you're done talking. This is it.

1297
01:16:49,390 --> 01:16:51,820
This is my, this is my
closing statement. Here it is.

1298
01:16:52,090 --> 01:16:57,090
I'll bet you that at least 70% of UFC
fans have been or are a WWE fan at some

1299
01:16:58,061 --> 01:16:59,050
point 70%.

1300
01:16:59,090 --> 01:17:03,140
I love when people throw a statistic
around where they have done zero research.

1301
01:17:03,320 --> 01:17:07,220
Just a random number, I believe 70. I
do it all the time by the way. Yeah. Uh,

1302
01:17:07,590 --> 01:17:12,470
70 I bet. Bet 90%. No, I did. They look,

1303
01:17:12,950 --> 01:17:15,950
it's not the God damn same.
One of them is real.

1304
01:17:16,190 --> 01:17:20,900
One of them people that are battling
for their life and the most difficult

1305
01:17:20,901 --> 01:17:22,290
contest and all the reports.

1306
01:17:22,550 --> 01:17:27,550
Another one is some weird fucking jerk
off thing that strange guys do when they

1307
01:17:28,251 --> 01:17:32,810
sit in front of the TV and pretend they
don't know it's fake, right? It's 10. No,

1308
01:17:32,811 --> 01:17:35,480
I know it's fake. Everybody knows
it's fake. You don't want to know.

1309
01:17:35,481 --> 01:17:37,520
You shut that part of your brain
off. When you watch it, you're like,

1310
01:17:37,730 --> 01:17:41,300
like a lizard. They went to immediately
to take a full time writers job.

1311
01:17:41,301 --> 01:17:44,750
I know it's fake. Even even if
you wrote it, you would still be

1312
01:17:44,860 --> 01:17:48,290
there while it happened going,
I can't believe.

1313
01:17:48,291 --> 01:17:50,980
I can't believe

1314
01:17:53,950 --> 01:17:54,670
you would.

1315
01:17:54,670 --> 01:17:58,570
You would have your fucking script in your
hand and you'd be jumping up and down,

1316
01:17:58,571 --> 01:17:59,680
spinning around in circles.

1317
01:18:00,010 --> 01:18:04,510
I can't believe prompt the undertaker.
Oh yeah.

1318
01:18:04,520 --> 01:18:09,520
I'm real and Grabow worlds collide.

1319
01:18:10,930 --> 01:18:13,870
Oh yeah. I never got to finish.
So I wrote a thing to wear

1320
01:18:14,280 --> 01:18:15,030
Kane,

1321
01:18:15,030 --> 01:18:20,030
the undertakers brother wrestled Brock
Lesnar at this wrestlemania coming up in

1322
01:18:20,250 --> 01:18:22,530
seven months or so and uh,

1323
01:18:22,650 --> 01:18:25,740
loses but undertaker comes back.

1324
01:18:25,860 --> 01:18:29,970
Tombstone pal drives Brock Lesnar and
they walk off together. Amazing Swan Song.

1325
01:18:29,971 --> 01:18:30,804
They wait

1326
01:18:34,350 --> 01:18:35,830
when you come up with a move.
Yeah.

1327
01:18:36,010 --> 01:18:37,470
For a guy to win with.
Yeah.

1328
01:18:37,510 --> 01:18:41,620
Do you take into consideration at all the
health of the person trying to attempt

1329
01:18:41,621 --> 01:18:43,570
that move? It's tough. You're right. Yeah.

1330
01:18:43,571 --> 01:18:46,930
It's tough because when Brock Lesnar
did that shooting star press flipped

1331
01:18:46,931 --> 01:18:49,870
through the air and landed on his
head. I've seen that. I've seen that.

1332
01:18:49,871 --> 01:18:54,220
Everybody see anybody like who knew about
Brock Lesnar, who was researching him.

1333
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:58,360
Very likely if you were going through
like internet videos and stuff like that,

1334
01:18:58,650 --> 01:19:01,570
you would run into that video of him
flipping off the top rope and landing on

1335
01:19:01,571 --> 01:19:06,571
his head off 300 pounds of them landed
on his head bang and kept going.

1336
01:19:07,700 --> 01:19:11,950
Yeah. Crazy. I don't know how the fuck
you lived. I know if you watched that,

1337
01:19:11,980 --> 01:19:13,630
it looks like he's a dead man.
Yeah.

1338
01:19:14,170 --> 01:19:18,040
Wayne's on his fucking head. Yeah.
There's some stuff that just can't even,

1339
01:19:18,130 --> 01:19:22,240
they just probably an
inch either way and he's,

1340
01:19:22,810 --> 01:19:25,290
he can't move his legs and stuff,
but he survived it.

1341
01:19:25,560 --> 01:19:29,520
I don't know how he did it and then
how he went on to fight actually fight,

1342
01:19:29,521 --> 01:19:30,360
fight afterwards.

1343
01:19:30,870 --> 01:19:34,920
Was that a big blow to the WWE when they
realized that Brock Lesnar got fucked

1344
01:19:34,921 --> 01:19:39,780
up? I do at Brown pride tattooed on his
body. Oh No. I don't know what that is.

1345
01:19:40,110 --> 01:19:43,050
What's Black Brown? Oh,
Cain Velasquez. Oh No. Yeah.

1346
01:19:43,080 --> 01:19:44,730
I didn't know he had a brown pride tattoo.

1347
01:19:44,790 --> 01:19:48,510
How do you know him and not know he has
a brown pride tattooed on his chest.

1348
01:19:48,770 --> 01:19:51,560
It's a big point of contention.
I. Dot. I don't know.

1349
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:55,200
I don't tell a lot of people who are
white people find it quite offensive cause

1350
01:19:55,201 --> 01:19:58,260
you could never fight with white
pride tattooed on your chest.

1351
01:19:58,360 --> 01:19:59,770
Hmm. That's interesting. Yeah.

1352
01:19:59,771 --> 01:20:03,780
Now that I'm just hearing about this
for the first time, that is uh, that's,

1353
01:20:03,850 --> 01:20:04,683
that's an interesting,
yeah.

1354
01:20:04,920 --> 01:20:07,590
You're alone only allowed to
be proud if you're minority.

1355
01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:12,180
If you're proud and you're a majority,
you're mocking everybody else.

1356
01:20:12,240 --> 01:20:16,860
You're gloating, you're, or you're
racist trying to hold back the others.

1357
01:20:17,100 --> 01:20:19,800
If you have black pride and no
one gives you a hard time at all,

1358
01:20:19,830 --> 01:20:20,850
you could have a tee shirt on,

1359
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:24,780
on television that says black pride
and no one would have issue with it.

1360
01:20:25,170 --> 01:20:28,470
But if you went on like CNN
with a white pride shirt on,

1361
01:20:28,740 --> 01:20:32,670
they might fucking kill you
with rocks. Yeah, that's insane.

1362
01:20:32,760 --> 01:20:37,380
I never thought of that before. White
Man's been held down for a long time. Wow.

1363
01:20:37,590 --> 01:20:42,360
You want to go to the meeting now? What
meeting? The white pride meeting. Uh,

1364
01:20:42,450 --> 01:20:44,480
you're willing,
they're willing to join us in our ranks.

1365
01:20:45,260 --> 01:20:49,040
So you're asking me if I
think it messed up the WWE.

1366
01:20:49,041 --> 01:20:52,730
When Cain Velasquez beat Brock, I beat
him so easily. I think the entire,

1367
01:20:52,731 --> 01:20:57,320
I think Brock going into the UFC and
doing anything good whatsoever completely

1368
01:20:57,321 --> 01:21:00,230
helped the WWE and the WWE is Brock.

1369
01:21:00,670 --> 01:21:05,020
I think Brock Lesnar, no bullshit.
Brock Lesnar did it the right way.

1370
01:21:05,350 --> 01:21:10,350
Like if Brock Lesnar left the WWE and
dedicated himself to becoming the best

1371
01:21:11,771 --> 01:21:15,160
fighter in the world,
I mean like best striking coaches,

1372
01:21:15,580 --> 01:21:20,040
best Jujitsu coaches and overall coach.
Like a guy like Matt [inaudible],

1373
01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:22,930
Matt Hume,
like a John Crouch,

1374
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:26,500
like a real MMA coach who's
going to go over your game.

1375
01:21:26,501 --> 01:21:30,940
A guy who's well versed in all the
variables when it comes to fighting like a

1376
01:21:30,940 --> 01:21:33,610
Duane Ludwig.
Go over your game inside and out.

1377
01:21:33,910 --> 01:21:37,030
Find out what they can fix it
and worked on him for years.

1378
01:21:37,060 --> 01:21:39,700
If someone did that with him
and then built him up, slow it.

1379
01:21:39,850 --> 01:21:44,260
You start out in the RFA started out
in these smaller organizations and then

1380
01:21:44,261 --> 01:21:47,500
eventually you work your way up to a
larger organization and then eventually

1381
01:21:47,530 --> 01:21:49,660
fight in the UFC when you have,
you know,

1382
01:21:49,661 --> 01:21:54,640
1520 fights instead of your second
fucking pro fight being against a former

1383
01:21:54,641 --> 01:21:55,570
world champion.

1384
01:21:55,780 --> 01:22:00,580
His second pro fight in the UFC
was against frank fucking mirror.

1385
01:22:00,640 --> 01:22:04,150
That's crazy. He fights heath
herring. He fights Frank Mir.

1386
01:22:04,210 --> 01:22:07,320
I mean that's just ridiculous. He's not
ready. He could have been great though,

1387
01:22:07,330 --> 01:22:09,880
right? He could have been an all time.
Great. Yeah, he could have been an all.

1388
01:22:09,890 --> 01:22:14,130
He's a real freak athlete,
like no doubt about it. When,

1389
01:22:14,150 --> 01:22:17,860
when he fought, he's herring was just
running heath hearing over and just like,

1390
01:22:17,861 --> 01:22:22,750
Holy Shit. The first time I saw him fight,
I saw it. I saw his first fight live.

1391
01:22:23,380 --> 01:22:28,360
I saw him fight in Hollywood.
He fought in La at a,

1392
01:22:28,361 --> 01:22:31,780
it was a k one event and
it was really bizarre man.

1393
01:22:31,781 --> 01:22:34,810
It's like Dennis Rodman was
there and they were talk,

1394
01:22:34,811 --> 01:22:37,900
everyone was talking shit about the UFC,
like they were trying to get,

1395
01:22:38,350 --> 01:22:39,850
they were trying to get,
um,

1396
01:22:41,560 --> 01:22:44,420
like some sort of publicity by
like talking shit about the UFC.

1397
01:22:44,420 --> 01:22:45,700
So they hired Dennis robbed.

1398
01:22:45,701 --> 01:22:49,720
And this was like right when Dennis Rodman
was coming off of those reality shows

1399
01:22:49,721 --> 01:22:53,830
where he's all fucked up on drugs and
you know, it had metal all over his face.

1400
01:22:53,831 --> 01:22:58,660
And he's like, yeah, UFC
ain't shit compared to carry
one. No, no, they didn't.

1401
01:22:58,870 --> 01:23:01,840
And it was the first time Brock
Lesnar ever fought. And, uh,

1402
01:23:01,930 --> 01:23:05,950
I just remember he took down this
guy, uh, I forget dude's name.

1403
01:23:05,951 --> 01:23:10,390
I'm sure it's here on his
website somewhere, but he, uh,

1404
01:23:10,450 --> 01:23:14,260
took down this kind of smashed him and
like in no time and I remember thinking,

1405
01:23:14,290 --> 01:23:17,950
Ooh, that is a lot to handle.
Like that's a big boy.

1406
01:23:18,370 --> 01:23:22,600
That's not a, that's not like, I
mean he's, he's fucking enormous.

1407
01:23:22,601 --> 01:23:24,010
That's not a small guy.

1408
01:23:24,240 --> 01:23:28,150
He's an enormous former
NCAA wrestling champion.

1409
01:23:28,690 --> 01:23:30,640
Like a real wrestler.
Yeah.

1410
01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:33,670
You know, he's, he's unbelievable.

1411
01:23:33,730 --> 01:23:36,790
And I mean if that bacteria
infection in his stomach,

1412
01:23:36,791 --> 01:23:40,870
that really almost killed him. I
mean it really almost killed him. Uh,

1413
01:23:41,350 --> 01:23:44,590
didn't happen. I think it could
have gone a few different ways,

1414
01:23:44,620 --> 01:23:48,610
but I think either way he would've gone
back to the WWF because you can make so

1415
01:23:48,611 --> 01:23:49,151
much money.

1416
01:23:49,151 --> 01:23:53,500
They're doing such less work and such
less training and I think he's sort of

1417
01:23:53,501 --> 01:23:56,170
into that, cause he, they
don't work him a lot.

1418
01:23:56,171 --> 01:23:57,580
They don't work him like other wrestlers.

1419
01:23:57,581 --> 01:24:00,340
He has a special deal where
he gets paid millions in,

1420
01:24:00,341 --> 01:24:03,880
has to show up maybe 20 times a year,

1421
01:24:04,040 --> 01:24:08,800
a couple of Monday nights, he's comes out,
pops corn, jumps up and down, goes back,

1422
01:24:08,801 --> 01:24:10,660
you know,
his manager does all the talking.

1423
01:24:10,720 --> 01:24:14,170
You can't beat my client and he's
just standing there looking cool.

1424
01:24:14,200 --> 01:24:17,200
And how can we move to the back?
He has a better deal than everybody else.

1425
01:24:17,230 --> 01:24:21,670
Cause he's Brock Lesner, he's the,
he's, he's known as a, you know,

1426
01:24:21,880 --> 01:24:24,900
a killer. Is he the guy that's
like the most respected God?

1427
01:24:24,901 --> 01:24:27,730
I can't believe I'm asking you to tell
me any questions and see the guys the

1428
01:24:27,731 --> 01:24:31,270
most respect. Ronda Rousey was at raw
on Monday with the four horse women.

1429
01:24:31,330 --> 01:24:33,970
I wonder why she was,
you think maybe she got paid for that,

1430
01:24:34,570 --> 01:24:39,280
but that's what they do. That's
what, yeah, yeah, yeah. Um,

1431
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:40,840
that's the old thing.

1432
01:24:40,890 --> 01:24:45,870
Yeah. In 2075, this guy, Troy hung, he
was supposed to fight Choi Hong Man.

1433
01:24:46,260 --> 01:24:49,980
But uh, that guy got injured
and they replaced him with
a guy named min suit Kim.

1434
01:24:49,981 --> 01:24:53,220
And he crushed him in one minute
and nine seconds the first round,

1435
01:24:53,820 --> 01:24:57,330
and then his second fight
was against Frank Mir.

1436
01:24:58,140 --> 01:24:59,070
So ridiculous.

1437
01:25:02,740 --> 01:25:06,040
Yeah.
The 360 favorite video ever.

1438
01:25:06,041 --> 01:25:07,780
My favorite Internet video ever.

1439
01:25:07,781 --> 01:25:12,781
The buffer three 60 and that's when you
interview or does he do it between Brock

1440
01:25:12,941 --> 01:25:15,940
and Lesner? Yeah. Yeah,
it shows him right there.

1441
01:25:16,060 --> 01:25:17,140
Shows talking to Brock right there.

1442
01:25:18,780 --> 01:25:21,930
He made his debut in the UFC.

1443
01:25:21,960 --> 01:25:25,900
His first fight against Frank Mir.
Unfucking believable.

1444
01:25:26,700 --> 01:25:30,990
Yeah, that's what, that's
one of the craziest things
I've ever heard in my life.

1445
01:25:31,440 --> 01:25:36,330
And then he fought a heath herring
and his next fight. It's crazy.

1446
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:39,180
Absolutely crazy.
The next fight after that,

1447
01:25:39,330 --> 01:25:43,470
he fought for the title and beat Randy
couture. Wrap your fucking head around.

1448
01:25:43,471 --> 01:25:47,370
That does wrap your head around that.
The guy fought twice in the UFC,

1449
01:25:47,700 --> 01:25:49,920
one against Frank Mir,
one against heath herring,

1450
01:25:49,950 --> 01:25:51,990
and then his next fight is
Randy couture for the title,

1451
01:25:52,140 --> 01:25:56,880
his fourth fucking fight in MMA. He Beats
Randy coture for the heavyweight title.

1452
01:25:57,000 --> 01:26:01,560
Legitimately knocked him out, dropped him
and stopped him on the ground. I mean,

1453
01:26:01,561 --> 01:26:04,170
that, that's just fucking crazy. Yeah.

1454
01:26:04,250 --> 01:26:05,960
Really is fucking crazy man.

1455
01:26:05,990 --> 01:26:08,850
He's a monster athlete and they have
the belt on him right now and it's,

1456
01:26:08,900 --> 01:26:13,850
it's good draws a lot of people.
It draws a lot of people in. Yeah.

1457
01:26:14,180 --> 01:26:15,740
And uh, you know, they made,

1458
01:26:15,800 --> 01:26:19,700
they wrote a great one for this last
one tip for him to win the championship.

1459
01:26:19,701 --> 01:26:22,340
He just completely dominated the good guy.

1460
01:26:22,550 --> 01:26:25,430
Normally it's a back and forth battle.
Whoa.

1461
01:26:25,431 --> 01:26:28,150
But this was completely one side.

1462
01:26:28,151 --> 01:26:31,370
It's something like 16 German suplex is,
and by the way,

1463
01:26:31,371 --> 01:26:33,440
that that guy's landing
on the back of his neck,

1464
01:26:33,441 --> 01:26:35,330
just like Brock and that
shooting star press.

1465
01:26:35,331 --> 01:26:38,060
Some of these were sloppy and
that Brock undertaker match.

1466
01:26:38,390 --> 01:26:42,200
He literally gave the undertaker
concussion. It was bad. It was sloppy.

1467
01:26:42,201 --> 01:26:45,920
It wasn't supposed to go this way. But
when Brock hits those German suplex is,

1468
01:26:46,340 --> 01:26:47,810
even though they're paying
them a lot of money,

1469
01:26:47,811 --> 01:26:50,630
he's nowhere near the technical wrestler.
Like the guys that were,

1470
01:26:50,631 --> 01:26:53,360
had been built in,
built in the machine.

1471
01:26:53,870 --> 01:26:58,070
So when he hits a German suplex and he
throws a man over his head, he's not,

1472
01:26:58,640 --> 01:27:02,180
the guys can land on their neck and head
and stuff and the undertaker was in bad

1473
01:27:02,181 --> 01:27:05,240
shape. So Brock, sort of one of the
guys that's sort of a liability,

1474
01:27:05,241 --> 01:27:08,720
like he can take a guy out even
though you don't want him to.

1475
01:27:08,810 --> 01:27:13,640
How many of those dudes have like neck
surgery? Almost all of them. Nick Foley,

1476
01:27:13,700 --> 01:27:16,460
who I opened up for a couple of weeks ago,
known as mankind.

1477
01:27:16,461 --> 01:27:17,630
Dude love Cactus Jack.

1478
01:27:17,631 --> 01:27:22,631
The multiple personalities restless
literally is having back surgery or right

1479
01:27:22,851 --> 01:27:24,230
now. Really? Yup.

1480
01:27:24,290 --> 01:27:28,580
And he's had something like a
47 broken bones. It's all real.

1481
01:27:28,581 --> 01:27:31,400
He's missing his right ear.
He, he's missing his ear.

1482
01:27:31,750 --> 01:27:33,590
What happened was here it fell off.

1483
01:27:35,030 --> 01:27:36,950
It fell off during a match.

1484
01:27:36,951 --> 01:27:40,010
This is the guy that took the dive
off the hell on the cell versus the

1485
01:27:40,011 --> 01:27:40,844
undertaker through it.
Yeah.

1486
01:27:40,940 --> 01:27:42,860
Oh, that guy. Nobody
fucking knows about that.

1487
01:27:43,110 --> 01:27:45,960
Right? Nobody knows. Nobody knows.

1488
01:27:46,050 --> 01:27:49,190
This is the guy that did
the thing we all talk about.

1489
01:27:49,270 --> 01:27:54,100
Yeah. I'm telling you, it was like the,
uh, it's like the nine 11 of the WWF,

1490
01:27:54,230 --> 01:27:57,680
so he's ear fell off.
Was it a cauliflower ear?

1491
01:27:57,710 --> 01:28:01,310
Was it that that happens in MMA
fight sometimes, yeah. Cause it's so,

1492
01:28:01,340 --> 01:28:04,580
you know what call it failure.
Yeah, I used to Russell's it, yeah.

1493
01:28:05,100 --> 01:28:09,080
When your blood leaks into your ear
it hardens and becomes like calcium.

1494
01:28:09,410 --> 01:28:12,950
And so like when people look at people
with like fucked up years from grappling,

1495
01:28:13,190 --> 01:28:17,330
those things are hard and sometimes when
they get hit it literally breaks the

1496
01:28:17,331 --> 01:28:18,890
skin and it tears off.

1497
01:28:19,220 --> 01:28:23,420
Like chunks of people's ears have fallen
off during fights and like landed on

1498
01:28:23,421 --> 01:28:24,860
the ground inside the octagon.

1499
01:28:25,060 --> 01:28:27,940
I wrestled for four years
in high school and uh,

1500
01:28:27,970 --> 01:28:32,130
my senior year I remember I didn't get
cauliflower ear but some stuff broke up

1501
01:28:32,131 --> 01:28:36,430
up there and the top of my right
ear was black for like a month.

1502
01:28:36,610 --> 01:28:38,410
And it really freaked me out.
I didn't,

1503
01:28:38,411 --> 01:28:41,590
I didn't ever look into what it was
they did was my coach is just like,

1504
01:28:41,591 --> 01:28:43,330
we'll put some extra
padding in your head gear.

1505
01:28:43,331 --> 01:28:46,150
And so I had one side that stuck
out more than the other side.

1506
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:49,440
I always wear head gear,
man. I don't want the I,

1507
01:28:49,450 --> 01:28:53,440
the problem with cauliflowers
you, everybody's like,
yeah, makes you look tough,

1508
01:28:53,650 --> 01:28:56,470
but it also affects the way
you're hearing works, right?

1509
01:28:56,500 --> 01:29:01,500
Like the design of your ear evolution as
sort of created this thing that allows

1510
01:29:02,040 --> 01:29:05,280
you to best capture the sound around you.
It's like,

1511
01:29:05,610 --> 01:29:09,240
it's not like a cute look at the
reason why your ears shaped like that.

1512
01:29:09,241 --> 01:29:10,080
I always tell people,

1513
01:29:10,290 --> 01:29:15,290
take your ear and then take the top of
your ear and then fold it down and listen

1514
01:29:15,871 --> 01:29:18,420
to how different shit
sounds and then let it go.

1515
01:29:18,690 --> 01:29:22,800
Like take that and just cover it up and
then let it go when it's covered up.

1516
01:29:23,370 --> 01:29:25,350
That's how Randy coture
hears all the time.

1517
01:29:25,670 --> 01:29:30,000
Like that's what his hearing is like and
his ear hole is this tiny little thing

1518
01:29:30,450 --> 01:29:33,420
like, well, lead Ishmael is
this a famous Jujitsu fighter?

1519
01:29:34,500 --> 01:29:39,480
They call them the leg, his ears.
It's like he has too hard, like a,

1520
01:29:39,481 --> 01:29:43,350
like a mouse sized thing
stuffed into each ear.

1521
01:29:43,351 --> 01:29:46,800
It's like they open his ear up,
stuffed this hard mouse thing like so.

1522
01:29:46,801 --> 01:29:51,240
His whole is like so tiny. No Q tips for
that guy. He's not using any cute tips.

1523
01:29:51,620 --> 01:29:52,890
If he does,
he's a cute dude.

1524
01:29:52,891 --> 01:29:55,590
He's got a force that bitch in there
and you're never going to get it out.

1525
01:29:56,390 --> 01:30:00,330
It's like he's got little tiny
tiny holes. That's, that's bad.

1526
01:30:00,360 --> 01:30:03,180
You're not supposed to do
that. Yeah, but people like it.

1527
01:30:03,510 --> 01:30:07,620
They like it because it makes them look
like fucking bad asses. I don't know.

1528
01:30:07,680 --> 01:30:10,860
I think he's responsible for a lot of
fighters. Bad choices and walk in music.

1529
01:30:11,640 --> 01:30:12,220
Oh Wow.

1530
01:30:12,220 --> 01:30:14,350
Getting music by the way.
That's my favorite thing.

1531
01:30:15,310 --> 01:30:17,230
They probably have no idea
what they're listening to.

1532
01:30:18,130 --> 01:30:21,040
I love that part of everything.

1533
01:30:21,041 --> 01:30:25,000
Especially the UFC because it is so crazy.

1534
01:30:25,001 --> 01:30:28,230
Like the quiet before the storm and
some people pick the worst song.

1535
01:30:28,630 --> 01:30:29,680
Well you know what's fucked up?

1536
01:30:29,681 --> 01:30:32,740
This dude Roy Mcdonald's is one
of the top fighters in the UFC.

1537
01:30:32,741 --> 01:30:35,890
He's a top contender in the welterweight
division is bad motherfucker. Oh,

1538
01:30:35,910 --> 01:30:40,030
he's had bad walking music. Like one
time he came out to can't touch this.

1539
01:30:40,660 --> 01:30:45,290
I was mocking him. I had to, I was
goofing on it. I was like, ah, is this

1540
01:30:47,140 --> 01:30:48,900
great song back in the
day, by the way. Yeah.

1541
01:30:49,180 --> 01:30:52,060
Props to MC hammer frosty and I
have a thing has come and gone.

1542
01:30:52,090 --> 01:30:54,100
We always talk about we go,

1543
01:30:54,150 --> 01:30:57,180
we will make predictions right
off of that. Every single fight.

1544
01:30:57,310 --> 01:31:01,390
What happened was Rory wasn't
picking his walking music.

1545
01:31:01,540 --> 01:31:02,770
He changed his phone number.

1546
01:31:02,771 --> 01:31:07,771
He moved from Vancouver area to Montreal
and he changed his phone number and the

1547
01:31:08,831 --> 01:31:12,770
guy who got his old phone
number was a fan. Just a rant.

1548
01:31:12,790 --> 01:31:16,750
It happened to be a fan
because in Vancouver in that
area Colona where he's from

1549
01:31:16,810 --> 01:31:19,780
is fucking huge. He's a huge star.
Like when he fought in Vancouver,

1550
01:31:19,781 --> 01:31:22,450
people went nuts.
They were so psyched to see him there.

1551
01:31:23,410 --> 01:31:27,580
So this guy just happened to get his
phone number happened to be a fence when

1552
01:31:27,581 --> 01:31:31,360
they texted him, what do you want for
your walk up Music Rory? He's like, what?

1553
01:31:31,480 --> 01:31:32,313
Oh my God.

1554
01:31:32,350 --> 01:31:36,610
So he never told anybody and he
had this phone number for years.

1555
01:31:36,611 --> 01:31:39,440
He was giving shitty walking music to Roy.
We titled

1556
01:31:41,770 --> 01:31:43,080
that is Hilarious.

1557
01:31:43,450 --> 01:31:46,390
And then finally Rory called up
the number or something like that.

1558
01:31:46,391 --> 01:31:50,850
They were like finally figured out that
he wasn't really Rory. Wow. We're hey.

1559
01:31:51,130 --> 01:31:54,370
Like they said to Rory, you know we
get your text for all your song picks.

1560
01:31:54,371 --> 01:31:57,200
He's like, what? I'm not
sending any texts. Oh,

1561
01:31:57,700 --> 01:31:59,770
I didn't fucking say what
number were you texting?

1562
01:32:00,010 --> 01:32:02,680
And then he realized it was his
old number. That's so funny.

1563
01:32:05,020 --> 01:32:08,460
The guy must have been in
home just giggling like,

1564
01:32:08,500 --> 01:32:11,720
like a child when can't touch
this came on. He wants to be like

1565
01:32:14,040 --> 01:32:16,780
came touches dude.
You didn't walk in.

1566
01:32:16,781 --> 01:32:19,670
Music is so powerful because
you could psych out in yeah.

1567
01:32:19,730 --> 01:32:24,120
Opponent with walk in music if
it's done properly. If it's some,

1568
01:32:24,160 --> 01:32:28,660
if it's some subtle crazy
stuff, you know? No, you can't.

1569
01:32:29,300 --> 01:32:30,133
Little bit

1570
01:32:30,540 --> 01:32:35,370
me can wrestling. You're look around.
What is that trembling? He's playing that.

1571
01:32:35,550 --> 01:32:37,830
Who's that? Phil Collins.
I can feel it in here.

1572
01:32:40,630 --> 01:32:43,010
You think?
I believe this is my song.

1573
01:32:45,160 --> 01:32:48,650
I think if you're on, if you're fighting
in the UFC and you come out first,

1574
01:32:48,800 --> 01:32:49,670
you add your song.

1575
01:32:49,671 --> 01:32:54,671
Let's say your songs like a seven on a
one to 10 and then lights go out and Phil

1576
01:32:56,180 --> 01:32:59,390
Collins in the air tonight does come
in. You're not a little bit like, fuck,

1577
01:32:59,391 --> 01:33:01,540
I wish I would've picked
this guy he's already got,

1578
01:33:01,560 --> 01:33:05,150
he's already got one on me
is already willing to one
below. And that's the intro.

1579
01:33:08,850 --> 01:33:13,680
You
need to call Vince Mcmahon right now.

1580
01:33:14,010 --> 01:33:17,940
You think like a fucking pro
wrestling fan. Can I say that?

1581
01:33:17,941 --> 01:33:22,260
With all due respect? I'm not, I'm not
hating on it. But you think like you,

1582
01:33:22,261 --> 01:33:27,120
you take any joy in that stupidity. I
know I do. It's entertaining as hell.

1583
01:33:27,121 --> 01:33:30,660
Vince, why are you slipping?
This is the management.

1584
01:33:30,710 --> 01:33:34,230
Turn your organization around your them
either and they should call you the

1585
01:33:34,231 --> 01:33:38,460
mastermind and they should make you a
character as well. I agree with you.

1586
01:33:38,540 --> 01:33:42,690
Where those gold wrestling shoes, that's
your whole outfit. It's shiny gold.

1587
01:33:43,240 --> 01:33:47,170
I'm the mastermind. Good to
be here in Vancouver, right?

1588
01:33:48,660 --> 01:33:52,170
Oh, what's wrong? You don't
like my plans for the future.

1589
01:33:53,820 --> 01:33:55,050
I can feel it.

1590
01:33:58,290 --> 01:34:01,320
Oh my God. Yeah. There's an article.

1591
01:34:01,350 --> 01:34:05,460
Go on bloody elbow.com if you go to
bloody elbow.com and read about the,

1592
01:34:05,461 --> 01:34:06,390
if you're a UFC fan,

1593
01:34:06,391 --> 01:34:11,391
it's by our friend Crooklyn Stephie
Daniels who wrote this story about,

1594
01:34:11,731 --> 01:34:15,240
Oh, this imposter choosing Roy
McDonald's walk up music for years.

1595
01:34:15,420 --> 01:34:19,140
For fucking years. The dude did it. Oh,

1596
01:34:19,260 --> 01:34:22,170
oh my God. It's so funny, man.

1597
01:34:23,720 --> 01:34:26,160
Oh,
it even says how I was making fun of them.

1598
01:34:30,460 --> 01:34:32,440
Oh man, this sucks a little
bit. For folks who don't know,

1599
01:34:32,441 --> 01:34:36,070
I'm a big Roy McDonald Fan and you,
you actually hear his voice during the,

1600
01:34:36,130 --> 01:34:39,520
when you hear Joe Rogan podcast,
check it out. That's Roy. Oh,

1601
01:34:39,620 --> 01:34:40,570
that's him from one of the,

1602
01:34:40,571 --> 01:34:44,320
and then the other one is Nick Diaz
going train by day Joe Rogan podcast by

1603
01:34:44,321 --> 01:34:48,730
night all day. It's a greatest quote of
all time of my entire career by the way.

1604
01:34:49,690 --> 01:34:53,860
I just think this, this dude, I want to
interview this guy. Whoever the guy is,

1605
01:34:54,370 --> 01:34:57,010
he's hilarious, man. Whoever that dude,

1606
01:34:58,580 --> 01:35:03,290
but it's like he had a loopy fiasco,
light work. That was one of them.

1607
01:35:03,740 --> 01:35:06,530
Rihanna, we found love.
That was another one.

1608
01:35:08,660 --> 01:35:12,200
But he came in with good ones.
Like he had Metallica seek and destroy.

1609
01:35:12,590 --> 01:35:16,960
That's a good one, Huh?
Yeah. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm.

1610
01:35:17,450 --> 01:35:21,270
And then, uh, he had a violin
orchestra for one of them. I see.

1611
01:35:21,290 --> 01:35:25,790
I think that would be awesome.
Yeah. Why not, right? Yeah.
Just something different.

1612
01:35:26,270 --> 01:35:29,480
Something different. Make
the opponent wonder. Wow,

1613
01:35:29,570 --> 01:35:33,440
what's the psychological plan here?
What is it about all that stuff,

1614
01:35:33,470 --> 01:35:35,740
even though you know it's
total 100% horseshit.

1615
01:35:35,870 --> 01:35:39,170
What is it about that stuff that's
appealing to you? The Entertainment Gel.

1616
01:35:39,171 --> 01:35:41,660
If you watch one of these things,
you would,

1617
01:35:41,840 --> 01:35:46,490
you would see what you liked about it and
you would have a few favorites and no,

1618
01:35:46,730 --> 01:35:48,320
no.
I'd go fucking crazy.

1619
01:35:48,321 --> 01:35:51,620
And I'd watch lions killing gazelles
on television because that's real.

1620
01:35:51,860 --> 01:35:53,900
That's what I'd do. I'd grab my
laptop and I'd be like, yeah,

1621
01:35:53,901 --> 01:35:57,020
you watched this fake shit all
day. I need real, I need real.

1622
01:35:57,021 --> 01:36:01,370
I can't get entertained by
frank, but that's what TV
shows. The movies are there.

1623
01:36:01,371 --> 01:36:03,830
Fake. No, no, they're not.

1624
01:36:03,831 --> 01:36:07,190
Fake sports are real
and that I understand,

1625
01:36:07,310 --> 01:36:10,820
and this is sports entertainment.
It's not, it's not. We're not.

1626
01:36:10,850 --> 01:36:14,660
Nobody's saying it's really when you
watch game of Thrones and you watch a guy

1627
01:36:14,661 --> 01:36:17,480
get his head cut off, you
know what it looks like. Yeah.

1628
01:36:17,660 --> 01:36:20,780
It looks like a guy actually getting
his head cut off. It looks real.

1629
01:36:21,140 --> 01:36:24,590
When I watch wrestling and
I see a guy get hit and go

1630
01:36:26,330 --> 01:36:30,400
turned to the crowd, I know
that's bullshit. Right?

1631
01:36:30,530 --> 01:36:34,650
It's offensive to me.
It's offensive. Yeah,

1632
01:36:35,210 --> 01:36:38,900
and the idea is other moves that happen
that are amazing. Nope. Nope, nope.

1633
01:36:39,370 --> 01:36:43,700
They're all offensive. Oh No. I know
they take athleticism to pull off,

1634
01:36:43,730 --> 01:36:46,310
but they're offensive
because I'm so aware.

1635
01:36:46,340 --> 01:36:48,710
It's so in my face that this
is not really happening.

1636
01:36:48,920 --> 01:36:51,770
I can't be the guy in the gold
suit holding on to the script,

1637
01:36:52,010 --> 01:36:53,520
jumping around and place going.

1638
01:36:54,380 --> 01:36:58,580
Her lost the streak has bed proud again.

1639
01:36:59,090 --> 01:37:02,300
That's what you would do. You would freak
the fuck out. He wouldn't run around.

1640
01:37:02,510 --> 01:37:04,280
I wouldn't do that.
You would if you were hired.

1641
01:37:04,281 --> 01:37:07,300
If I had a gold suit I would do that,
but I don't have a cold.

1642
01:37:07,540 --> 01:37:09,740
I can see you doing it.
Vince is fucking up.

1643
01:37:09,950 --> 01:37:11,330
Really needs to make you a part of it.

1644
01:37:11,590 --> 01:37:15,730
I told him Tony when
immediately you should do it
and I can't believe you didn't

1645
01:37:15,731 --> 01:37:20,210
take it Tony cause that is the leg one
of the biggest things for for you because

1646
01:37:20,230 --> 01:37:24,880
you are that. That's what trying to
negotiate doing it part time from La.

1647
01:37:24,940 --> 01:37:26,620
That would be awesome.
That would,

1648
01:37:26,621 --> 01:37:30,640
that would be best for both sides because
I wouldn't get burned out on it and

1649
01:37:30,641 --> 01:37:32,770
they would have awesome,

1650
01:37:32,771 --> 01:37:36,900
great ideas that are hip and cool and I
would have been able to do what I wanted.

1651
01:37:37,070 --> 01:37:40,680
Hip and cool. Whenever guys says
my ideas are hip and cool, I'll go.

1652
01:37:41,220 --> 01:37:45,120
Are you sure the pins,
what ideas he's talking about has a scarf.

1653
01:37:47,310 --> 01:37:50,220
Scarf. It's a scarf with
little skulls all over it.

1654
01:37:50,221 --> 01:37:52,950
Like he's a pirate and he's
drinking a Frappaccino.

1655
01:37:55,530 --> 01:37:59,140
Are you ever saw this one caring?
Yes.

1656
01:38:00,190 --> 01:38:02,730
Undertaker has gone.
Metro,

1657
01:38:06,280 --> 01:38:09,030
Metro, sexual undertaker.
Maybe if you changed.

1658
01:38:09,480 --> 01:38:14,300
All of a sudden Tony starts working for
them and every character becomes gay and

1659
01:38:14,310 --> 01:38:19,310
it turns out that there's someone
who's sprinkling gay dust overall.

1660
01:38:20,160 --> 01:38:23,700
The other competitors where there in
the locker room, there's, he's turning.

1661
01:38:23,701 --> 01:38:27,690
That's the, that's a plot that Tony comes
up when he turns the entire roster gay.

1662
01:38:28,140 --> 01:38:32,460
It turns out there's an openly gay
wrestler and he has gay fairy dust. Okay,

1663
01:38:32,461 --> 01:38:36,240
well he was, he didn't like a
leprechauns ball sack. You read,

1664
01:38:36,241 --> 01:38:39,210
kill the Leprechaun and turned
his ball sack until like this.

1665
01:38:39,300 --> 01:38:40,230
Are you ready for this?

1666
01:38:41,010 --> 01:38:46,010
What if I were to tell you that there is
an openly gay wrestler that blows dust

1667
01:38:47,191 --> 01:38:52,130
in people's spaces? Fuck that. His
name is gold dust. No fucking way.

1668
01:38:52,140 --> 01:38:56,950
There he is right there. Yeah, Dude.

1669
01:38:57,060 --> 01:39:00,560
This is in the WWE. Dustin
Rhodes, a third generation rest.

1670
01:39:00,670 --> 01:39:03,450
What's going on with his Dick?
That's gold dust.

1671
01:39:04,680 --> 01:39:08,660
You've heard a horsepower
that's like related to the
dusty roads? Yeah. Yeah. Hey,

1672
01:39:08,661 --> 01:39:11,540
how did it, how did she know about
that? See Rhodes to be eight.

1673
01:39:12,220 --> 01:39:14,540
This shit made sense.
Thank you Jeff.

1674
01:39:17,970 --> 01:39:20,610
This guy's real. Please.
I need to see more.

1675
01:39:20,611 --> 01:39:23,710
I can't believe I invented a guy
that already exist. Yeah you can.

1676
01:39:23,940 --> 01:39:26,570
You should be writing this.
That's him and his uh,

1677
01:39:26,740 --> 01:39:29,800
insurance cell phone when he
takes off the wagon robe and he

1678
01:39:31,850 --> 01:39:36,480
flirts with them in the ring and Shit
blows and kisses and they get all riled up

1679
01:39:36,481 --> 01:39:39,930
and then he can beat him with shit
cause they were like all I'm not gay.

1680
01:39:39,931 --> 01:39:43,230
Get away from me. And he's like, oh
yeah, come here. Beautiful. And they're

1681
01:39:43,500 --> 01:39:44,311
did the WWE,

1682
01:39:44,311 --> 01:39:47,170
he should hire Michael Sam as soon
as he's done with the Dallas cowboys.

1683
01:39:48,940 --> 01:39:52,200
He's the openly gay NFL
player. I don't, I don't know.

1684
01:39:52,380 --> 01:39:54,790
He's not good enough to make the team
and just bringing them for the practice

1685
01:39:54,791 --> 01:39:55,480
squad.

1686
01:39:55,480 --> 01:39:59,890
They need to bring that dude into
WWE and actually fuck a guy on TV.

1687
01:40:00,130 --> 01:40:03,710
Well him and gold dust. Yeah, but gold
does is faking it. I could tell it.

1688
01:40:03,711 --> 01:40:07,450
Look it up. My Guy Straight. Yeah,
he's super straight. Is super straight.

1689
01:40:07,720 --> 01:40:11,470
That's the cat whisperer guy, isn't it?
The same actor guy as the cat whisperer.

1690
01:40:11,590 --> 01:40:15,480
What's the cat whisperer? The TV show.
What's that? It's a show where this,

1691
01:40:15,550 --> 01:40:19,210
it's like the dog whisperer,
but for cats. Oh God, really?

1692
01:40:20,110 --> 01:40:22,090
Here's how you fix it.
Cat Rocks.

1693
01:40:25,400 --> 01:40:29,360
Dusty Rhodes is his dad and he has
a brother named Cody Rhodes funk.

1694
01:40:29,560 --> 01:40:33,820
Problem solved. I actually have a
coyote issue, my neighborhood now,

1695
01:40:34,390 --> 01:40:35,560
cause I have so many chickens.

1696
01:40:35,561 --> 01:40:38,020
These coyotes are circling
my house on a daily basis.

1697
01:40:38,021 --> 01:40:41,380
Every time I come home there's coyotes
around my gate now. Oh Shit. It's creepy.

1698
01:40:41,381 --> 01:40:45,190
Fucked your chickens ever wake up in the
middle of the night and wake you up. No.

1699
01:40:45,191 --> 01:40:48,100
Chickens don't wake up at night. They
sleep all night. In fact, you can go,

1700
01:40:48,101 --> 01:40:50,260
I can go in the chicken house
at night and just pick them up.

1701
01:40:50,320 --> 01:40:54,070
They're just sitting there. You just
grab them. I pick them up and him. Yeah.

1702
01:40:54,160 --> 01:40:57,800
Don't make a little more
in south central.

1703
01:40:57,801 --> 01:41:02,410
Are they just all night long or is
that roosters? Roosters, yeah. Yeah.

1704
01:41:02,411 --> 01:41:06,880
That's Mexican guys. Love
it. I don't say this,

1705
01:41:07,180 --> 01:41:11,950
you know, I'm not generalized sizing
generals, Isaac's generalizing,

1706
01:41:11,980 --> 01:41:15,610
but a lot like my friend, my friend,
uh, I don't want to say his name.

1707
01:41:15,940 --> 01:41:19,900
He's a older gentleman that happens
to be a, a guy I've known for decades.

1708
01:41:19,960 --> 01:41:24,490
Mexican dude. He, he keeps
roosters in his yard. Like he has,

1709
01:41:25,690 --> 01:41:29,860
I want to say he has a hundred chickens.
It's close to a hundred chickens. Wow.

1710
01:41:29,890 --> 01:41:33,160
And he uses him for fighting.
Like they gamble on it.

1711
01:41:33,220 --> 01:41:38,220
It's just been a part of their culture
for as long as they can remember a

1712
01:41:38,261 --> 01:41:39,220
hundred chicken,

1713
01:41:39,280 --> 01:41:43,390
they have like an arena that has like
a barn and they take these friends come

1714
01:41:43,391 --> 01:41:47,650
over, they cook a goat, they could
goats and a, it's really crazy.

1715
01:41:47,651 --> 01:41:51,280
Like that's also a normal
part of their culture.

1716
01:41:51,490 --> 01:41:55,120
And he was renting a house once and
he was telling me the story of how

1717
01:41:55,121 --> 01:41:57,110
ridiculous it was.
And he was like a,

1718
01:41:57,140 --> 01:41:59,980
they got in trouble for butchering
of goat cause someone, uh,

1719
01:42:00,130 --> 01:42:02,090
someone called it in on them and you know,
the,

1720
01:42:02,091 --> 01:42:04,750
the landlord said you can't do that.
You can't butcher goat is like,

1721
01:42:04,980 --> 01:42:07,460
it's not weekly. We left
home alone, you know,

1722
01:42:07,461 --> 01:42:11,300
so he didn't like cut it open and just
leave the guts out so the neighborhood

1723
01:42:11,301 --> 01:42:14,050
smells it. He goes like, he's
like, we eat it. Yeah. And he goes,

1724
01:42:14,110 --> 01:42:17,560
but I could cook hamburgers in my yard
and no one have a problem with it.

1725
01:42:17,800 --> 01:42:22,630
But he was like, but this goat,
like I know how healthy it is.

1726
01:42:22,631 --> 01:42:25,300
I know that it's, it's good
meat. I know how fresh it is.

1727
01:42:25,570 --> 01:42:29,020
Like we kill that goat and then they
roast it. They have like a, like a,

1728
01:42:29,050 --> 01:42:32,980
like a barbecue and a bunch of guys would
come over and they would eat goat and

1729
01:42:33,340 --> 01:42:37,720
get drunk and have rooster fights.
Wow. Yeah. And it's a tall,

1730
01:42:37,750 --> 01:42:39,880
I mean we think it's fucked up,

1731
01:42:40,210 --> 01:42:44,500
but it's a total normal part of their
culture. Yeah. And they eat the chickens.

1732
01:42:44,830 --> 01:42:46,780
I mean, after it's all over,
it's kind of fucked up.

1733
01:42:46,781 --> 01:42:50,020
Cause they do make these chickens fight
to the death. But after it's over,

1734
01:42:50,021 --> 01:42:53,620
they turned him into soup.
But so it's like, I, you know,

1735
01:42:53,730 --> 01:42:57,040
part of me says it's animal
cruelty of the, the biggest part.

1736
01:42:57,070 --> 01:43:01,400
Like my gut reaction. I look at
that. Should that be legal? Wow.

1737
01:43:01,530 --> 01:43:03,250
Oh that's kind of a fucked up thing to do.

1738
01:43:03,370 --> 01:43:05,800
It's kind of a fucked up thing to put
razor blades in the end of a chicken's

1739
01:43:05,801 --> 01:43:07,930
foot and stick them in a cage and
another chicken. They fucking, yeah,

1740
01:43:08,170 --> 01:43:11,860
they should just do fake chicken
fighting. See, I'm a gay chicken.

1741
01:43:11,861 --> 01:43:16,690
Come Alvin the blonde wig and
all right guys. I lost Sean that

1742
01:43:18,740 --> 01:43:19,900
it's gotta be real chicken.

1743
01:43:20,290 --> 01:43:24,070
Can't believe it's gold guys real.
I came up with a guy who blows dust.

1744
01:43:24,520 --> 01:43:27,010
No, his dad, you named it dusty Rhodes.

1745
01:43:27,330 --> 01:43:30,960
Let them know that he exists and he's
got a brother named Cody Rhodes who just

1746
01:43:30,961 --> 01:43:35,760
made the jump to being star
dust, which is the, uh,

1747
01:43:35,761 --> 01:43:36,594
he's like the,

1748
01:43:36,840 --> 01:43:40,920
he's like another version of gold
dust except up now they roll together.

1749
01:43:41,220 --> 01:43:44,640
So he's gay too.
Now star dust is more like,

1750
01:43:44,641 --> 01:43:47,060
just like about the cosmos and like,
ah,

1751
01:43:47,061 --> 01:43:51,770
I just can't believe all
the magical things. So yeah.

1752
01:43:51,890 --> 01:43:56,270
So he's high. Yeah. So he's
like a stone or stone to the
gills. Oh, that's so funny.

1753
01:43:56,330 --> 01:43:59,750
Except he's just on, you never know.
Do you think that it's possible to,

1754
01:43:59,751 --> 01:44:03,050
Tony could get me to like pro wrestling?
Yes. Oh, I know for a fact, dude.

1755
01:44:03,051 --> 01:44:06,170
I would know. I knew the exact
match is the videos, the moves,

1756
01:44:06,171 --> 01:44:09,980
the everything that would, that would
interest you or see too much real.

1757
01:44:10,280 --> 01:44:15,030
There's some crazy submission moves that a
no, no, no, no, no. That was the last day.

1758
01:44:16,640 --> 01:44:21,260
That's the last thing you want to show me.
Don't that'll get me angry.

1759
01:44:21,410 --> 01:44:25,370
I'd be like, that wouldn't work,
right. No defense here. Hip Escape.

1760
01:44:25,610 --> 01:44:26,450
He can get out of there.

1761
01:44:26,570 --> 01:44:30,470
Nothing drives me crazier than like
a fake submission move in a movie.

1762
01:44:30,900 --> 01:44:32,480
That shit drives me nuts.
You know,

1763
01:44:32,481 --> 01:44:36,620
I stopped watching Dexter because fucking,

1764
01:44:36,830 --> 01:44:40,520
what's his name from third rock? John
Lithgow. John Lithgo have this chicken,

1765
01:44:40,521 --> 01:44:42,690
a rear naked choke in a bathtub and he,

1766
01:44:42,691 --> 01:44:45,080
and he killed her that way and I was like,
oh my God,

1767
01:44:45,081 --> 01:44:49,310
that's the worst fucking room naked
choke I've ever seen. That's so fake.

1768
01:44:49,400 --> 01:44:52,340
She's not even red. I'm
done. And I shut it off.

1769
01:44:52,370 --> 01:44:55,280
I walked out of the room and discussed
and I'd never watched another episode of

1770
01:44:55,281 --> 01:44:59,900
Dexter again. Wow. Yeah. You can't
show me a fake rear naked choke.

1771
01:44:59,901 --> 01:45:02,540
You fucks that.
That makes me angry.

1772
01:45:02,780 --> 01:45:05,780
That's like if you were
watching a Jimi Hendrix bio,

1773
01:45:05,781 --> 01:45:08,870
pick a non bio pic,

1774
01:45:08,871 --> 01:45:11,810
but like a you one of those
movies where it's a fake look.

1775
01:45:11,811 --> 01:45:14,410
An actor plays Jimmy Hendrix. I
guess that's a bio pic, right? Yeah.

1776
01:45:14,750 --> 01:45:17,570
And some do didn't know how to play
guitar and he's like Kinda around. Yeah,

1777
01:45:18,800 --> 01:45:22,290
and you'd be like, no, y'all got
doing it. You're not doing it at all

1778
01:45:22,550 --> 01:45:23,420
playing guitar.

1779
01:45:23,810 --> 01:45:27,260
That's what John Lithgow is Shitty
fucking Renee get choked did for me.

1780
01:45:27,740 --> 01:45:32,420
The only reason I think you would maybe
like it in the future is that you like,

1781
01:45:32,600 --> 01:45:33,171
you know,

1782
01:45:33,171 --> 01:45:37,850
UFC so much an MMA and Jujitsu so much
and Tony gets it together with a bunch of

1783
01:45:37,851 --> 01:45:38,890
people and watches it.

1784
01:45:39,290 --> 01:45:42,050
A lot of them watch it as a joke and
where Tony I think takes it a little bit

1785
01:45:42,150 --> 01:45:46,760
serious tone. We all watched it
as a joke. I can I not buying,

1786
01:45:46,761 --> 01:45:47,390
I joke.

1787
01:45:47,390 --> 01:45:52,390
I just see and recognize
what's entertaining about it
and I do like the ideology

1788
01:45:52,581 --> 01:45:56,990
of stunning and arena of people.
Sometimes that happens,

1789
01:45:58,100 --> 01:45:58,933
it can happen.

1790
01:45:59,300 --> 01:46:04,300
You have to look at the reaction is the
three hour like job interview for you.

1791
01:46:06,590 --> 01:46:10,010
This is like your audition tape.
They should fucking hire you.

1792
01:46:10,340 --> 01:46:15,330
They should figure it out. I need you
to pull this up. Where are you, man?

1793
01:46:16,130 --> 01:46:20,750
Listen, take the needle out of your ass
and hire this guy. You're crazy not to.

1794
01:46:20,780 --> 01:46:23,030
You should have seen the
looks on these people's faces.

1795
01:46:23,031 --> 01:46:26,300
When Brock Lesnar beat the undertaker,
nobody thought it was going to happen.

1796
01:46:26,480 --> 01:46:28,430
Oh my God, what did they do, Tony?

1797
01:46:28,640 --> 01:46:32,600
Imagine if on Saturday the
fuck is wrong with you.

1798
01:46:33,050 --> 01:46:37,220
Nobody thought it was going to happen.
It was amazing. It was fake as fuck dude.

1799
01:46:37,670 --> 01:46:40,250
But nobody thought it was going to happen.

1800
01:46:40,251 --> 01:46:44,640
A lot of things are fake that nobody
thought was going to happen. Tony, Tony,

1801
01:46:44,650 --> 01:46:45,483
Tony at the time,

1802
01:46:45,530 --> 01:46:50,530
imagine if that guy who filled in for
that shit's gay on Saturday and he took on

1803
01:46:51,241 --> 01:46:51,780
Dillashaw.

1804
01:46:51,780 --> 01:46:56,780
Imagine if in the miracle he was able to
somehow land a punch on Dillashaw beat

1805
01:46:57,331 --> 01:46:58,860
him, the place would have been. I mean,

1806
01:46:58,861 --> 01:47:01,890
well it's sort of weird cause that's
Sacramento and that's Dillashaw his

1807
01:47:01,891 --> 01:47:04,650
hometown. But I'm just saying
like in a neutral field,

1808
01:47:04,651 --> 01:47:07,290
that would have been stunning and
everybody would have known that they just

1809
01:47:07,291 --> 01:47:09,420
witnessed history. Tony,
that would have been real.

1810
01:47:09,730 --> 01:47:12,220
Right. It wasn't even real
to really happen movement.

1811
01:47:12,230 --> 01:47:17,230
It really knocked out a professional
athlete to guys who've trained to fight

1812
01:47:17,351 --> 01:47:21,460
their entire lives.
It's real. Right, right.

1813
01:47:21,461 --> 01:47:24,370
I understand you. You're
so crazy. You, by the way,

1814
01:47:24,371 --> 01:47:26,470
this stuff is trying
to sell insurance here.

1815
01:47:27,850 --> 01:47:30,340
I understand where your concerns are,

1816
01:47:30,341 --> 01:47:34,870
but let me just show you the details
of our policy. You're a crazy person.

1817
01:47:35,080 --> 01:47:37,720
No,
I'm telling you why

1818
01:47:37,850 --> 01:47:41,660
there's millions and millions
of WWE and I'm telling you why.

1819
01:47:41,720 --> 01:47:45,450
Maybe hunters Thompson was just a couple
of decades off when it was predicting

1820
01:47:45,451 --> 01:47:50,450
the end of the world. Those guys, they
mean it's not easy. If, for example,

1821
01:47:50,451 --> 01:47:55,220
Brock was furious when Vince told him
that he wanted him to beat the undertaker

1822
01:47:55,221 --> 01:47:59,390
that day, like in real life like Betty
was, and you were there to see it. No,

1823
01:47:59,391 --> 01:48:02,630
but I talked to somebody who was,
oh, I bet he was honest with you.

1824
01:48:02,780 --> 01:48:06,950
It's not like they lie all day. Every
day. Tony's going to talk to some people.

1825
01:48:06,951 --> 01:48:09,890
Let me tell you a little, I'll tell
you what. Brock was actually mad.

1826
01:48:10,730 --> 01:48:15,020
He was really mad. He had read the script
and you just start. Dose is bullshit.

1827
01:48:15,170 --> 01:48:18,710
I'm not picking a fuck. You don't
undertake some of the guys that work.

1828
01:48:19,340 --> 01:48:24,340
Unlike the technical side for the UFC
work for the WWE heard Brock was crying.

1829
01:48:25,130 --> 01:48:29,820
That's what I heard was Brock went
to the hospital with the undertaker,

1830
01:48:29,840 --> 01:48:32,600
cried, so hardy dehydrated
himself. After that match,

1831
01:48:32,660 --> 01:48:34,330
they had to give them an IV to replenish.

1832
01:48:34,331 --> 01:48:36,950
His team thought he killed
the undertaker from that

1833
01:48:37,230 --> 01:48:42,000
Kachin. It was bad, bad. It was real.

1834
01:48:42,001 --> 01:48:44,350
The concussions are real.
You can't, you can't,

1835
01:48:45,530 --> 01:48:48,330
I don't even buy it was a real concussion.
They probably faked a concussion.

1836
01:48:51,060 --> 01:48:52,620
Take her to the hospital.

1837
01:48:52,830 --> 01:48:56,550
He's got up oboe and even
on the real booboo folks,

1838
01:48:56,551 --> 01:48:59,610
if you don't think it's a real blue blah,
show you the fucking band aid on it.

1839
01:49:04,880 --> 01:49:08,040
My four year old

1840
01:49:10,170 --> 01:49:12,740
pitching something at four year olds,
so booboo,

1841
01:49:13,140 --> 01:49:17,450
it is a booboo and need up their day.

1842
01:49:17,880 --> 01:49:20,820
Honey, there's no, he's not even
bleeding. You don't need a bandaid. Oh,

1843
01:49:20,821 --> 01:49:24,300
I want a bandaid. Okay, well
band, they make you feel better.

1844
01:49:24,450 --> 01:49:27,600
We'll get you a bandaid. It took the
undertaker and put a bandaid on them.

1845
01:49:30,480 --> 01:49:32,910
Tony Hinchcliffe in a gold
suit holding the script.

1846
01:49:33,030 --> 01:49:34,780
I can't believe it's our real,

1847
01:49:35,310 --> 01:49:39,930
he's jumping up and down and circles
and Vince Mcmahon is stand there shaking

1848
01:49:39,931 --> 01:49:42,420
his head.
Color of purple.

1849
01:49:43,650 --> 01:49:47,380
I'll fucking pent up with rage.
That's how I it

1850
01:49:55,490 --> 01:49:59,230
down. It's a booboo. Look at the
bandaid. It's real. It's a real bandaid.

1851
01:49:59,290 --> 01:50:03,460
Ladies and gentlemen, if you doubt
it. What else do you like? That sucks.

1852
01:50:03,700 --> 01:50:08,160
Um, let's see. What else
do I liked? It sucks. Uh,

1853
01:50:11,970 --> 01:50:16,000
I guess I play fantasy football. I
don't talk about that a lot. Well,

1854
01:50:16,001 --> 01:50:20,010
fantasy football is at least
based on fucking football, right?

1855
01:50:20,050 --> 01:50:24,460
Which is a real game. People are
really trying and shit really happens,

1856
01:50:24,490 --> 01:50:27,730
but nobody knows what's going to
happen in real sports. My God.

1857
01:50:27,760 --> 01:50:30,460
Isn't that part of what makes it exciting?
You fucking Weirdo.

1858
01:50:30,461 --> 01:50:33,940
Same thing about the eat. Oh Shit.
He don't know what's going to happen.

1859
01:50:35,140 --> 01:50:38,470
You don't know what's going to
happen. You predicted a writer? No.

1860
01:50:38,471 --> 01:50:42,880
The writer knows what's going to happen.
Oh, the writer knows it's not real.

1861
01:50:43,300 --> 01:50:47,530
It's like a play.
Do you like musicals now?

1862
01:50:47,710 --> 01:50:52,180
I've been the one gay or than musicals.
How about that? That doesn't make sense.

1863
01:50:52,480 --> 01:50:55,540
Sure it does. It's dudes are
hugging. They get all sweaty.

1864
01:50:55,541 --> 01:51:00,280
They're laying on each other.
They're an and it's not real. Okay.

1865
01:51:03,340 --> 01:51:06,940
I mean, after musicals guys
are banging, but do you know,

1866
01:51:07,240 --> 01:51:09,580
I don't know if they're banging.
I don't go to those things.

1867
01:51:10,870 --> 01:51:13,630
I'm not in that world. You've
seen a musical, right? Yeah.

1868
01:51:13,631 --> 01:51:16,480
I've seen a bunch of musicals. Not that
there's anything wrong with being gay,

1869
01:51:16,481 --> 01:51:21,360
by the way, but musicals are gay. They
just are. It really is. It really is.

1870
01:51:21,400 --> 01:51:23,590
Unless it's a humorous musical.
Yeah.

1871
01:51:23,830 --> 01:51:28,590
Even then it's even then he made
someone kisses ass. Right. Uh,

1872
01:51:29,320 --> 01:51:32,380
that's someone else. That's a Photoshop,
isn't it? Yeah. That's not the real,

1873
01:51:33,490 --> 01:51:35,830
who's that guy?
That's a fake guy.

1874
01:51:38,040 --> 01:51:40,360
Probably one of you out there.
We'll just go look for it.

1875
01:51:40,810 --> 01:51:42,340
That's the thing about the Internet,
man.

1876
01:51:42,620 --> 01:51:44,350
There's a photo of you
out there somewhere.

1877
01:51:44,770 --> 01:51:48,700
Someone's Photoshop to Dick in your
mouth or you kissing ass or you doing

1878
01:51:48,701 --> 01:51:53,220
something ridiculous and over my Mustang,
but why did he do that as a challenger?

1879
01:51:53,590 --> 01:51:54,610
Why did he do that?

1880
01:51:54,730 --> 01:51:59,050
Why he pulled his pants down and made
someone kisses ass on TV? Probably.

1881
01:51:59,290 --> 01:52:01,870
That sounds like something he
would do, but he did. You know it.

1882
01:52:01,900 --> 01:52:03,520
Why are you pretending
you didn't watch that one?

1883
01:52:03,580 --> 01:52:08,080
It spits back thinking they think
that was over like 1213 years ago.

1884
01:52:08,081 --> 01:52:12,160
Something like that. You weren't
there yet, Huh? No, I can't remember.

1885
01:52:12,610 --> 01:52:15,250
I can't remember. I don't believe
it. I think you're being mocked.

1886
01:52:15,251 --> 01:52:19,690
That may have been during the period
where, why don't you guys kissed his ass?

1887
01:52:23,410 --> 01:52:25,690
Fuck your brother.
Backyard wrestling.

1888
01:52:25,691 --> 01:52:29,140
Kind of gauge how many people in
the audience though. That's insane.

1889
01:52:29,290 --> 01:52:32,770
Plus it's been winning the Monday
night cable wars for over 20 years.

1890
01:52:33,010 --> 01:52:36,790
Think about that for a second.
Every Monday night at wins,

1891
01:52:36,880 --> 01:52:41,220
every single month they pulled TNA
though. They pulled TNA from, yeah,

1892
01:52:41,800 --> 01:52:46,010
from a spiky expenses competition.
What's the problem with TNA?

1893
01:52:46,160 --> 01:52:49,520
I'm just not good enough. Everything's
terrible. They're just completely,

1894
01:52:50,480 --> 01:52:54,110
it's not even in the snow. That's what
it should be. Bribed. But it's not,

1895
01:52:54,170 --> 01:52:57,140
it's not even in the same
ballpark. What is it? Well,

1896
01:52:57,141 --> 01:52:59,660
they used to have like a lot
of the MMA guys would do it.

1897
01:52:59,661 --> 01:53:04,310
Like King Mo was in TNA and rampages
and TNA. There's not good. No, no.

1898
01:53:04,410 --> 01:53:07,640
That's wrong with it. Bad writing, bad
everything. Could you go over there?

1899
01:53:07,641 --> 01:53:08,800
Maybe ma'am,
yes or no?

1900
01:53:08,801 --> 01:53:13,250
I don't want you don't turn
down the WWE TNA. Listen,

1901
01:53:13,251 --> 01:53:15,920
you could be the fucking mogul. What
do they give you a piece of the action.

1902
01:53:16,160 --> 01:53:19,220
What is DNA said? Listen, we heard
you on the Joe Rogan podcast.

1903
01:53:19,221 --> 01:53:20,750
We'd liked the way you
think about wrestling.

1904
01:53:21,020 --> 01:53:24,800
I think this organization has still
has some life and we're willing to uh,

1905
01:53:24,980 --> 01:53:29,510
willing to cut you in on this. Give you
10% of the action. I don't own 10% of TNA.

1906
01:53:29,511 --> 01:53:33,410
I'm pretty sure 10% of the TNA wouldn't
even get me what I would have made with

1907
01:53:33,411 --> 01:53:37,370
the WWE. You son of a bitch.
Yeah. They just lost the TV deal.

1908
01:53:38,270 --> 01:53:40,070
They don't have a TV deal.
Yeah,

1909
01:53:40,071 --> 01:53:43,280
they're done and maybe it'll
get picked up by like lifetime.

1910
01:53:43,640 --> 01:53:48,350
Vince Mcmahon beat Ted Turner.
What does Ted Turner, CNN, CNN,

1911
01:53:48,351 --> 01:53:52,970
TNT, TBS heat through Ted Turner
at open checks that he would,

1912
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:55,200
he would just sign any
wrestler back and uh,

1913
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:59,570
they were having wars on Monday nights.
They'd go against each other. Vince,

1914
01:53:59,571 --> 01:54:04,571
WWE on the USA network and TNT
had nitro and Ted Turner said,

1915
01:54:05,451 --> 01:54:07,400
whatever we need to do
to beat Vince Mcmahon,

1916
01:54:07,860 --> 01:54:10,100
I will write the check to
whoever's they offered.

1917
01:54:10,160 --> 01:54:13,490
They bought hall Kogan they
bought all these, this, he
believes this. I was there.

1918
01:54:13,580 --> 01:54:14,570
I was in the room.
No,

1919
01:54:14,571 --> 01:54:18,530
I didn't say I was there and he'll just
willing to spend whatever it takes.

1920
01:54:18,710 --> 01:54:22,890
That sounds like a plot, like a
plot in like two different, no, I'm,

1921
01:54:23,090 --> 01:54:26,840
this is where it's real. Just
part's real. That's the problem.

1922
01:54:26,841 --> 01:54:28,850
You've cried wolf through
this whole podcast.

1923
01:54:28,940 --> 01:54:33,710
I never said it was really also about
Santa Claus repeating that it's not real

1924
01:54:33,711 --> 01:54:37,240
and I'm agreeing with you and now you're
trying to tell us that the boogie man

1925
01:54:37,241 --> 01:54:41,720
is real. That's what you're
doing. Wrestling. So real.

1926
01:54:41,721 --> 01:54:44,120
I said that it's going to write it.

1927
01:54:44,480 --> 01:54:48,700
How much did Ted Turner spin
millions and millions to buy good.

1928
01:54:48,830 --> 01:54:51,560
The guys that were already
developed from the WWF,

1929
01:54:51,561 --> 01:54:55,940
he bought all their biggest guys
hoodie by Hulk Hogan. A macho man.

1930
01:54:55,941 --> 01:54:59,720
Randy Savage, you know,
macho man, dusty Rhodes.

1931
01:55:00,910 --> 01:55:04,770
I'm a slim Jim Fan. Right.
Snapping list. Then shit,

1932
01:55:06,170 --> 01:55:08,720
dusty Rhodes, he bought
them all. And how did it do,

1933
01:55:09,410 --> 01:55:14,150
they ended up winning the wars for
a bunch of weeks in a row. They did.

1934
01:55:14,180 --> 01:55:18,080
Yeah. It turned it. Yeah. For
like a year in a row. And uh,

1935
01:55:18,230 --> 01:55:20,270
but then Vince,
uh,

1936
01:55:20,360 --> 01:55:24,380
bought Mike Tyson and made him referent
match at Wrestlemania with Steve Austin

1937
01:55:24,381 --> 01:55:28,370
and shut Michelson that it dominated. The
rest is history. That's it. One move. Yup.

1938
01:55:28,540 --> 01:55:29,780
You know,
that's all it takes.

1939
01:55:29,781 --> 01:55:34,781
Sometimes just one move like Hugh grant
being on tonight show was what won the

1940
01:55:35,391 --> 01:55:38,390
tonight show the rating more and
it was like this rating more.

1941
01:55:38,391 --> 01:55:42,780
And then Jay Leno got Hugh grant on after
Hugh grant got busted with a squeaker

1942
01:55:43,910 --> 01:55:44,190
gas

1943
01:55:44,190 --> 01:55:47,080
dot. Merera would say, okay. Yeah.

1944
01:55:47,290 --> 01:55:51,360
Scag it black prostitutes ticket.
Skanky yeah. Remember that chick?

1945
01:55:51,410 --> 01:55:56,220
He got up and you could, uh, she was
advertising online like as a hooker,

1946
01:55:56,370 --> 01:55:59,880
like for the longest time. I know
if it still is, but like escort,

1947
01:56:00,090 --> 01:56:02,870
like this was the girl who got arrested
with you, grant that you could fuck her.

1948
01:56:03,690 --> 01:56:05,100
Like that was like the selling point.

1949
01:56:06,870 --> 01:56:09,990
And that one thing when Jay Leno
had him on the couch, he goes,

1950
01:56:09,991 --> 01:56:14,280
what the hell were you thinking?
Yeah. That one on the ratings war.

1951
01:56:15,510 --> 01:56:18,310
How that happens. Like that
crazy. What do you, oh,

1952
01:56:18,860 --> 01:56:22,970
because it's amazing that, uh, you know,

1953
01:56:23,060 --> 01:56:26,390
I just liked David Letterman a lot
more than Jay Leno and to think that,

1954
01:56:26,750 --> 01:56:29,300
you know,
using some scum buckets,

1955
01:56:29,301 --> 01:56:34,301
scummy life is a launching pad that Jay
can pass up a guy like Letterman and

1956
01:56:35,710 --> 01:56:38,320
by scum buckets, gummy life.
I'm talking about Hugh Grant,

1957
01:56:38,380 --> 01:56:42,040
awesome dude who takes crazy chances
that are entertaining. Like Hugh grant,

1958
01:56:42,250 --> 01:56:43,810
really,
if it wasn't for that,

1959
01:56:44,460 --> 01:56:48,160
a lot of people got a lot of enjoyment
out of the fact that he got busted with a

1960
01:56:48,161 --> 01:56:50,860
hooker.
I don't think it's good what he did,

1961
01:56:50,980 --> 01:56:53,470
but I don't necessarily think
it's bad either. You know,

1962
01:56:53,500 --> 01:56:57,100
he wanted something dangerous in his life.
He's a movie star.

1963
01:56:57,340 --> 01:56:59,470
He's living in this
fucking ridiculous life.

1964
01:56:59,471 --> 01:57:04,220
He has that beautiful woman for a
wife. What was her name? The one the,

1965
01:57:04,230 --> 01:57:08,980
the same chick who was involved recently,
Elizabeth Hurley. Remember God damn,

1966
01:57:08,981 --> 01:57:12,190
she was hot, but it's ridiculously
hot. He's like, I don't care.

1967
01:57:12,790 --> 01:57:13,960
I need something dangerous.

1968
01:57:16,360 --> 01:57:20,240
You got a streetwalker. What
did anything Murphy do? Trains.

1969
01:57:20,260 --> 01:57:23,600
Does anybody talk about that? Like
how does that never get brought up at,

1970
01:57:23,601 --> 01:57:27,010
he gets brought up. Why Eddie
Murphy doesn't go on stage anymore.

1971
01:57:27,040 --> 01:57:30,520
I guarantee you that you're probably
connected. It's gotta be right.

1972
01:57:30,860 --> 01:57:32,590
That's got to mess with them.
Dude.

1973
01:57:32,591 --> 01:57:37,591
I was at a comedy show with Charlie
Murphy and some dude was heckling from the

1974
01:57:37,601 --> 01:57:41,590
audience by cackling Charlie
Murphy and Charlie was,

1975
01:57:41,830 --> 01:57:44,260
Charlie got real with the guy.
You know,

1976
01:57:44,261 --> 01:57:48,550
like the guy said something to him and
Charlie was like, yeah, yeah, listen,

1977
01:57:48,580 --> 01:57:50,200
that's my brother and I'll fuck you.

1978
01:57:52,370 --> 01:57:54,100
It was like really that simple.

1979
01:57:54,350 --> 01:57:58,240
It's like all the comedy got dropped and
then the dude was in the audience and

1980
01:57:58,241 --> 01:58:02,020
you realize, I know he's only about 30 or
40 feet between him and Charlie Murphy.

1981
01:58:02,021 --> 01:58:04,240
Like that's a real person.
You can't just,

1982
01:58:04,770 --> 01:58:08,070
you can't just mock a guy's brother
like that and not expect something to go

1983
01:58:08,071 --> 01:58:13,030
have go wrong. Yeah. Yeah. My
friend, uh, I won't say his name,

1984
01:58:13,270 --> 01:58:13,781
but uh,

1985
01:58:13,781 --> 01:58:17,320
it was one of the police officers that
was involved in one of those altercations

1986
01:58:18,280 --> 01:58:22,860
with Eddie Murphy where there was
once he was helping a gentleman home,

1987
01:58:22,870 --> 01:58:26,170
a gentleman that likes
to dresses ladies and uh,

1988
01:58:26,240 --> 01:58:30,720
it was just trying to help somebody out.
No big deals. Big Best understanding.

1989
01:58:30,730 --> 01:58:34,240
And your friend's a cop. My
friend Beverly Hills Cop, he uh,

1990
01:58:34,241 --> 01:58:37,240
worked for the police force.
I don't believe it was Beverly hills,

1991
01:58:38,170 --> 01:58:41,980
but I guess it's okay. Got It. Banana

1992
01:58:41,980 --> 01:58:42,813
in the tailpipe.

1993
01:58:45,710 --> 01:58:47,470
It's a banana in the tailpipe.
Trick

1994
01:58:51,850 --> 01:58:55,540
for me as a, as a comic,
like as a young comic,

1995
01:58:55,541 --> 01:58:58,660
I can't imagine how guys, like we
talked about this yesterday with dom,

1996
01:58:58,870 --> 01:59:01,540
how guys just stop. Like with
Steve Martin, they just stop.

1997
01:59:01,900 --> 01:59:04,420
But to be a guy like
Eddie Murphy and stop.

1998
01:59:04,450 --> 01:59:09,410
If you ever go back and watch Eddie
Murphy delirious. It's hard because it's,

1999
01:59:09,411 --> 01:59:13,420
it's difficult for those things to
hold up today like they did back then,

2000
01:59:13,450 --> 01:59:16,090
but when I was a kid and
like whatever a year it was,

2001
01:59:16,091 --> 01:59:19,510
maybe it was like 86 or something like
that where Eddie Murphy delirious came on.

2002
01:59:19,660 --> 01:59:24,250
He was a destroyer of worlds.
He was so funny.

2003
01:59:24,340 --> 01:59:26,170
We were over.
My friend Jimmy lost his house.

2004
01:59:26,530 --> 01:59:31,030
You're watching it with Jimmy and John
Battle Rocco and John's sister and I

2005
01:59:31,031 --> 01:59:34,620
think a bunch of people there.
We were crying. Laughing. Yeah.

2006
01:59:34,810 --> 01:59:37,540
At Eddie Murphy delirious.
We couldn't believe how funny it was.

2007
01:59:37,570 --> 01:59:39,400
It was just insane.
Oh my God.

2008
01:59:39,401 --> 01:59:42,940
It's a funny is before I ever even
thought about doing standup comedy and the

2009
01:59:42,941 --> 01:59:47,410
idea that that guy is still around
by the way, looks fantastic. Yeah,

2010
01:59:47,411 --> 01:59:51,190
I was going to say that's the red leather,
right? Yeah, no, what I mean today,

2011
01:59:51,210 --> 01:59:55,720
it looks fantastic. I saw Eddie
Murphy in Maui about two years ago.

2012
01:59:55,780 --> 02:00:00,640
Just totally random. I was there with my
family and I ran into a Eddie's cousin,

2013
02:00:00,940 --> 02:00:04,450
uh, at the, uh, at the desk, at the check
in desk and was like, what's up dude?

2014
02:00:04,451 --> 02:00:07,230
What are you doing? He's like, Oh shit,
Charlie's here. You know, go say hi.

2015
02:00:07,231 --> 02:00:09,130
And so we went over and said Hi.
And he's with Eddie Murphy.

2016
02:00:09,160 --> 02:00:11,530
Eddie Murphy looks like he's
30 years old. Wow. I mean,

2017
02:00:11,531 --> 02:00:14,350
I don't know how old he is now. He's
gotta be in his fifties right? Yeah.

2018
02:00:14,540 --> 02:00:18,280
Because when I was
18 or something like that,

2019
02:00:18,310 --> 02:00:23,080
19 delirious came out and he was,
he got here like 24, 25 back then.

2020
02:00:23,081 --> 02:00:26,560
So he's gotta be in his fifties.
He looks fucking great. Yeah.

2021
02:00:26,710 --> 02:00:29,140
So whatever he's doing,
keep it up.

2022
02:00:31,780 --> 02:00:36,550
Yeah. It's black skin too though. Yeah.
Black people have black don't crack,

2023
02:00:36,610 --> 02:00:41,320
you know, straight the way better
aging. Like really blonde folks,

2024
02:00:41,860 --> 02:00:44,660
you know, like a, those
really Nordic looking,

2025
02:00:44,920 --> 02:00:48,630
those motherfuckers wrinkle up like
an old catcher's Mitt. Yeah. Oh,

2026
02:00:48,880 --> 02:00:51,800
just turns in on itself.
It's oily skin like,

2027
02:00:51,980 --> 02:00:56,020
like the dark and dark skin to cause that
dark skin doesn't get fucked up by the

2028
02:00:56,021 --> 02:00:58,030
sun. You know, Melanin,

2029
02:00:58,031 --> 02:01:00,850
Melanin protects you from all the shit
that white people are always worried

2030
02:01:00,851 --> 02:01:03,890
about. You know, they're always
putting fucking sunscreen on. Yeah.

2031
02:01:03,940 --> 02:01:07,060
That's why like you can like
look at Oprah. How old is she?

2032
02:01:07,540 --> 02:01:12,070
She looks great with the makeup on
in real life. You don't think so? Oh

2033
02:01:14,290 --> 02:01:17,580
No. Uh, if it's,

2034
02:01:17,710 --> 02:01:22,420
if people saw what Oprah looked like
in real life, she'd be dealing with,

2035
02:01:22,421 --> 02:01:27,310
uh, she'd be in the next
WWF superstar. Amazing.

2036
02:01:27,311 --> 02:01:31,900
That Oprah is one of the
few people that's gotten by.

2037
02:01:31,960 --> 02:01:32,771
Like few people.

2038
02:01:32,771 --> 02:01:37,771
That's a woman without ever
selling herself as a sexual object.

2039
02:01:38,970 --> 02:01:40,260
You got like your Barbara Walters

2040
02:01:40,260 --> 02:01:44,910
characters. He got like your
news people and you've got Oprah.

2041
02:01:45,280 --> 02:01:47,400
Well, she's never had a
choice. Right? She's never,

2042
02:01:49,730 --> 02:01:54,730
it's pretty easy to not be a sex
object when you can't be a sex object.

2043
02:01:55,001 --> 02:01:55,650
She's like one of them

2044
02:01:55,650 --> 02:01:57,720
main points against the,
you know,

2045
02:01:57,721 --> 02:02:01,590
the only way a woman gets on television
if she's like the biggest fucking,

2046
02:02:01,890 --> 02:02:06,060
if you, if you had a deal, you
got to like look at biggest stars,

2047
02:02:06,090 --> 02:02:10,260
like biggest stars in the country. She's
top 10 of the everyone doing everything,

2048
02:02:10,350 --> 02:02:14,790
whether they're singers, whether
they're actors, top 10 and I mean,

2049
02:02:14,791 --> 02:02:16,980
she's done some acting like
she was in the color purple,

2050
02:02:16,981 --> 02:02:19,050
but you can't really call her
an actor. Right. You know,

2051
02:02:19,410 --> 02:02:22,950
she's really just a personality.
And just from being a personality,

2052
02:02:23,100 --> 02:02:26,520
she's one of the most famous
people ever. Yeah. Tony,

2053
02:02:26,521 --> 02:02:27,870
would you fuck Oprah or Ellen?

2054
02:02:29,440 --> 02:02:30,080
Okay.

2055
02:02:30,080 --> 02:02:32,180
Um,
I or both.

2056
02:02:32,550 --> 02:02:37,140
If you had a choice between either or or
both. I would have to be Allen. I mean,

2057
02:02:37,141 --> 02:02:40,980
really a no brainer either or. Both
of you seen Oprah with no makeup? No.

2058
02:02:41,460 --> 02:02:42,510
But have you done accessing?

2059
02:02:43,540 --> 02:02:44,373
Okay.

2060
02:02:45,380 --> 02:02:47,990
Have you ever done ecstasy?
I think you'd do both.

2061
02:02:48,480 --> 02:02:49,670
No.
I know I would

2062
02:02:51,180 --> 02:02:54,290
have chosen love with
Oprah. Right. So, I mean,

2063
02:02:55,230 --> 02:02:58,680
it depends if like, am I at,
am I in Oprah's, you know,

2064
02:02:59,040 --> 02:03:03,270
a $30 million compound. I might be
more a little more easily swayed,

2065
02:03:03,271 --> 02:03:03,940
you know what I mean?

2066
02:03:03,940 --> 02:03:06,250
Be like a girl would be if
she went over a guy's house,

2067
02:03:06,251 --> 02:03:08,320
he picked her up in a
Lamborghini and drove her.

2068
02:03:08,810 --> 02:03:11,300
Pretty sure Oprah is a
billionaire with a B man.

2069
02:03:11,301 --> 02:03:14,810
There's something a little bit hot about
that it, there you go. Look at that.

2070
02:03:14,811 --> 02:03:18,520
Or she is, fuck yeah. For all of
you that have ever wanted a bone,

2071
02:03:18,530 --> 02:03:20,590
a rampage Jackson.

2072
02:03:22,110 --> 02:03:25,040
Oh my son

2073
02:03:28,860 --> 02:03:29,730
can't believe it.

2074
02:03:32,980 --> 02:03:33,970
You're a terrible person.

2075
02:03:34,930 --> 02:03:38,140
I have always made fun of people.
I like, I like picking on people.

2076
02:03:38,280 --> 02:03:42,710
You, you almost play a character.
You play kind of like a evil person.

2077
02:03:42,890 --> 02:03:45,590
So you're almost playing
a wrestler in real life.

2078
02:03:46,110 --> 02:03:50,640
Yeah. I say I like, uh, I like
picking on people. That's my move.

2079
02:03:51,160 --> 02:03:53,620
That's your move. If
you're a wrestler, yeah.

2080
02:03:53,621 --> 02:03:54,990
He'd be the guy that gets
under everybody's. Yeah.

2081
02:03:55,270 --> 02:03:56,103
Yeah.

2082
02:03:56,550 --> 02:04:01,430
Sticks and stones. I want to break
your bones, but my words will hurt you.

2083
02:04:01,620 --> 02:04:06,570
I want to take you back.
Tony, do you remember this?

2084
02:04:06,690 --> 02:04:11,070
Oh yeah, I do remember that so clearly.

2085
02:04:12,150 --> 02:04:13,220
Wow.
Okay.

2086
02:04:13,830 --> 02:04:15,630
This is an interesting time to drop this.

2087
02:04:22,180 --> 02:04:23,013
Wow.

2088
02:04:24,570 --> 02:04:27,090
Now to most people,
this is just shitty fucking music.

2089
02:04:28,790 --> 02:04:29,623
Okay.

2090
02:04:29,660 --> 02:04:32,250
People were complaints
so hard or my message,

2091
02:04:33,350 --> 02:04:37,980
I played this I love, I
was like, I understand the

2092
02:04:37,980 --> 02:04:41,250
grateful dead now.
I really do get it.

2093
02:04:41,640 --> 02:04:46,640
I never got what everybody was into with
the grateful dead until I did DMT with

2094
02:04:47,431 --> 02:04:52,170
this plane in the background. By the
way, a fighter comes out to this music,

2095
02:04:52,230 --> 02:04:54,690
that fighter in the rings like,
fuck man,

2096
02:04:54,691 --> 02:04:57,590
I don't want him to fucking fight
this guy. This is some shade. Yeah.

2097
02:04:57,900 --> 02:05:02,340
This guy's got extra pack and some
extra confidence. I worked out to this.

2098
02:05:02,860 --> 02:05:06,900
Really? Yeah. Yeah. Put
me in a weird place, man.

2099
02:05:07,680 --> 02:05:10,610
I was high as fuck.
Yeah,

2100
02:05:10,920 --> 02:05:15,120
you can get high and listen to this and
it takes you like really close to that

2101
02:05:15,121 --> 02:05:17,010
place.
That's what's fucked up.

2102
02:05:17,480 --> 02:05:22,410
It's like you have some weird
memory of like psychedelic trips.

2103
02:05:22,560 --> 02:05:26,100
Yeah. But when you have a psychedelic
trip that's connected to music,

2104
02:05:26,340 --> 02:05:30,030
when you hear the music again,
can recall some of the psychedelic trip.

2105
02:05:30,750 --> 02:05:33,030
I remember specifically the
last time I heard this song,

2106
02:05:33,031 --> 02:05:35,670
I was watching 70 pope's do the robot

2107
02:05:37,260 --> 02:05:39,690
pope's pope hats.
Wow.

2108
02:05:40,330 --> 02:05:41,163
Anyway,

2109
02:05:45,410 --> 02:05:47,480
there it goes.
That a WWE writing Gig,

2110
02:05:47,860 --> 02:05:48,693
right?

2111
02:05:50,670 --> 02:05:52,530
No, you're going to come
in as the wizard. Now.

2112
02:05:52,740 --> 02:05:54,480
You're going to come in as the showman.
Uh,

2113
02:05:55,620 --> 02:05:59,230
you're going to bring in Sharmans to
change change the course of events.

2114
02:06:00,810 --> 02:06:02,010
That was pretty intense,
Huh?

2115
02:06:02,400 --> 02:06:07,400
Tony didn't have any plans on doing DMT
either until we went to Texas until 40

2116
02:06:09,301 --> 02:06:11,790
minutes before it happened. Yeah. Yeah.

2117
02:06:11,791 --> 02:06:15,330
You weren't sure if you're going to do
it or not. Yeah. I didn't bring it up.

2118
02:06:16,110 --> 02:06:18,990
Brought it up like right before you
want to do this. And he was like, what?

2119
02:06:19,290 --> 02:06:22,980
[inaudible] which is the best way to do
it. Yeah. Don't think about that shit.

2120
02:06:22,981 --> 02:06:27,900
Just dive in. Especially DMT. Yeah.
But, but if you're worried about it,

2121
02:06:27,930 --> 02:06:29,910
don't do it. Right. But you did it.

2122
02:06:30,320 --> 02:06:35,090
Anything that lasts a 10 or 15
minutes, I could always do. Yeah.

2123
02:06:35,091 --> 02:06:38,450
But that 10 or 15 minutes
will change everything. Yeah.

2124
02:06:39,650 --> 02:06:43,910
So much fun.
What was surprising about it?

2125
02:06:45,470 --> 02:06:48,170
Um,
uh,

2126
02:06:48,710 --> 02:06:49,543
just the,

2127
02:06:49,640 --> 02:06:54,640
just the overall visions and craziness
and the mellow chillness of everything

2128
02:06:55,821 --> 02:06:59,840
and it was just a very cozy
environment and everything.

2129
02:07:00,500 --> 02:07:01,430
The experience.

2130
02:07:02,270 --> 02:07:02,460
Okay.

2131
02:07:02,460 --> 02:07:04,950
What did you expect versus
what it actually was?

2132
02:07:06,850 --> 02:07:07,683
MMM.

2133
02:07:08,320 --> 02:07:12,460
I didn't expect much. I don't know
anything about it, so I didn't know it.

2134
02:07:12,520 --> 02:07:15,940
I don't know anything about it going
into it. That's really crazy. Yeah.

2135
02:07:16,240 --> 02:07:20,230
That's probably why I just knew that
I had done mushrooms four days before,

2136
02:07:20,260 --> 02:07:24,070
so I'm like, all right, perfect.
You are primed. Here we go.

2137
02:07:24,630 --> 02:07:28,290
Yeah. As a part of Ari Shaffir
shroom fest, which is by the way,

2138
02:07:28,291 --> 02:07:30,750
growing people are doing it
all over the world and my God,

2139
02:07:31,070 --> 02:07:34,680
he announces that people,
people get on shrooms all over the world.

2140
02:07:34,710 --> 02:07:35,680
During that same week,

2141
02:07:35,790 --> 02:07:39,360
we had so much fun man.
That night that I went there,

2142
02:07:39,390 --> 02:07:43,890
there was a meteor shower and all out
meteor shower and it was like a plan thing

2143
02:07:43,891 --> 02:07:46,860
all over the news like media
shower tonight if you just
so happen to look at the

2144
02:07:46,861 --> 02:07:47,401
right time.

2145
02:07:47,401 --> 02:07:51,330
And we're out in the middle of the
desert where if there is a shoe you see,

2146
02:07:51,360 --> 02:07:55,320
you see a shooting star on a non meteor
shower night once every few minutes.

2147
02:07:55,770 --> 02:08:00,770
And this was just a shower of meteors
with a super moon because that's what he

2148
02:08:01,601 --> 02:08:05,190
scheduled shroom fest around.
So supermoon meteor shower,

2149
02:08:05,370 --> 02:08:09,120
lightening storm miles away
and one patch of the desert,

2150
02:08:09,121 --> 02:08:14,121
just lightening crazy beautiful
bolts and a cloud's supermoon and um,

2151
02:08:16,290 --> 02:08:18,420
and then when the sun came up,
you know,

2152
02:08:18,450 --> 02:08:21,660
it's that weird desert thing where it's
still dark on one side and there's a

2153
02:08:21,661 --> 02:08:26,610
moon and the sun coming up on the other.
And a nice warm shower. Rain started.

2154
02:08:26,611 --> 02:08:30,210
We were just like in heaven. We were just
cracking up for seven hours straight.

2155
02:08:30,240 --> 02:08:35,190
It was insane. And I've done three shroom
fest with Ari and I've always said,

2156
02:08:35,191 --> 02:08:39,360
you know, it's, it's better than
Christmas, it's the best holiday

2157
02:08:39,640 --> 02:08:39,911
did.

2158
02:08:39,911 --> 02:08:43,420
There's something beautiful about getting
together with a bunch of people having

2159
02:08:43,421 --> 02:08:44,800
that kind of an experience together.

2160
02:08:45,160 --> 02:08:47,470
Just wish you could do it without
actually having to take something.

2161
02:08:48,300 --> 02:08:52,720
Savani worked. Mckenna had
a, an interesting take on
that. He's like, you know,

2162
02:08:52,721 --> 02:08:55,120
people that want to do it naturally.
You know,

2163
02:08:55,121 --> 02:08:59,380
people want to do it through yoga
or meditation. He's like, he goes,

2164
02:08:59,381 --> 02:09:03,820
I don't ever want to be able to access
these places accidentally. Right.

2165
02:09:03,850 --> 02:09:06,490
Because like there's so titanic,
Lee Alien,

2166
02:09:06,700 --> 02:09:10,150
I want to take something that
gets me there. Yeah. And he, he,

2167
02:09:10,151 --> 02:09:14,770
his take on it was that everybody has
this problem with taking a psychedelic

2168
02:09:14,900 --> 02:09:17,320
that the idea of letting
go and taking something,

2169
02:09:17,321 --> 02:09:20,590
it's just too scary because we
always hear about people overdosing,

2170
02:09:20,591 --> 02:09:22,450
which certainly can happen
with a lot of drugs.

2171
02:09:22,830 --> 02:09:26,500
It doesn't happen with most psychedelics,
but people do have adverse reactions.

2172
02:09:26,500 --> 02:09:30,940
They do. They do like freak
out. It can absolutely happen.

2173
02:09:31,330 --> 02:09:36,330
But his take on the idea of trying to
get there without the drug is just s he

2174
02:09:37,661 --> 02:09:40,990
was like, it's so silly, it's, you know,

2175
02:09:40,991 --> 02:09:43,780
you can get there
instantaneously with the drug,

2176
02:09:43,781 --> 02:09:46,930
but everybody always wants to do it on
their own, you know? Right. There's like,

2177
02:09:46,931 --> 02:09:48,930
can I can do it naturally,
I can achieve those. I've,

2178
02:09:48,931 --> 02:09:52,120
I've talked to people that are like a
dent against psychedelics but want to

2179
02:09:52,121 --> 02:09:54,310
achieve psychedelic states
and they were just like,

2180
02:09:54,340 --> 02:09:56,800
I can get their natural and like,
I don't know if you can,

2181
02:09:57,320 --> 02:09:59,450
you might be able to get there,
but you can't stay there.

2182
02:09:59,451 --> 02:10:02,780
Like I've done transcendental meditation.
I've worked hard.

2183
02:10:02,781 --> 02:10:05,660
There's been a couple of periods in my
life where I worked hard at it and just

2184
02:10:05,661 --> 02:10:08,030
like any muscle,
you get better at it and yeah,

2185
02:10:08,090 --> 02:10:11,000
if you get good at it and you're into
it and you're in the right setting,

2186
02:10:11,060 --> 02:10:15,140
2030 minutes in of going
over and over again, you,

2187
02:10:15,350 --> 02:10:20,240
you're gone into that type of state,
but your brain immediately goes,

2188
02:10:20,510 --> 02:10:23,630
Whoa, you're in that state. Come back
into your back. You're like, whoa.

2189
02:10:23,631 --> 02:10:26,720
I was just somewhere for two seconds.
So you can get there,

2190
02:10:26,721 --> 02:10:31,160
but you can't really stay there like you
can with some help where you're in it

2191
02:10:31,161 --> 02:10:32,150
for a few hours.

2192
02:10:32,220 --> 02:10:32,491
Right.

2193
02:10:32,491 --> 02:10:37,491
But is that because you're not a practice
guru or a practice traveler in those

2194
02:10:38,330 --> 02:10:41,660
mental worlds? Isn't it possible
that there could be a way,

2195
02:10:41,830 --> 02:10:46,730
like the thing that gives me
hope is Kundalini. Cause my
friend Denny, uh, who's a,

2196
02:10:46,731 --> 02:10:51,290
he's a Kunal Indians, Cuna Lien
Kundalini instructor, and he's a,

2197
02:10:51,291 --> 02:10:54,080
he's practiced it for years and he's
done a bunch of psychedelics as well.

2198
02:10:54,260 --> 02:10:55,240
He told me that he's a bit,

2199
02:10:55,280 --> 02:10:59,570
he's able to achieve those states that
he can get to a state of hallucination,

2200
02:10:59,571 --> 02:11:00,890
like psychedelic hallucination.

2201
02:11:00,920 --> 02:11:04,820
He can literally get to a state where
his mind starts pumping out psychedelic

2202
02:11:04,821 --> 02:11:07,730
chemicals. He says, not
easy though, and you know,

2203
02:11:08,060 --> 02:11:11,630
but he's been doing it every day for
years. Wow. And he can get there.

2204
02:11:11,660 --> 02:11:15,920
So I think when, when someone, like
you says, you know, you, you get there,

2205
02:11:15,921 --> 02:11:17,780
but then you go, oh my God,
I can't believe I'm there.

2206
02:11:17,870 --> 02:11:21,710
I can totally relate to that because
I've been in there in the isolation tank

2207
02:11:21,711 --> 02:11:22,544
before.

2208
02:11:22,970 --> 02:11:26,840
There was one time I was in the
isolation tank where had this crazy

2209
02:11:26,900 --> 02:11:31,900
hallucination that I was a in some weird
tribe and these people in this tribe,

2210
02:11:32,511 --> 02:11:37,511
we're talking in a language that was
completely foreign but I could understand

2211
02:11:37,581 --> 02:11:41,120
it and I was even thinking
in their language and then
I realized it. I was like,

2212
02:11:41,150 --> 02:11:44,660
oh my God. I'm thinking in that language.
Then woke right up and it was over,

2213
02:11:44,870 --> 02:11:47,780
but I'll never forget that
because that moment I was like,

2214
02:11:48,170 --> 02:11:53,170
it seems so fun like that I could possibly
venture into some completely alien

2215
02:11:55,581 --> 02:11:56,630
civilization,

2216
02:11:57,050 --> 02:12:00,830
alien to me where I didn't know
anything about how they were talking.

2217
02:12:00,831 --> 02:12:04,430
I didn't know anything but I could
understand it and it was almost like this

2218
02:12:04,431 --> 02:12:09,431
window to what what communication
really is that communication.

2219
02:12:10,070 --> 02:12:14,000
Although languages very
and although cultures vary,

2220
02:12:14,390 --> 02:12:17,780
there's a thing that's going
on when you're communicating.

2221
02:12:17,781 --> 02:12:20,600
Like when you and I are talking right
now does that thing that's going on and

2222
02:12:20,601 --> 02:12:24,020
you can tap into that thing,
whatever that thing is,

2223
02:12:24,140 --> 02:12:27,580
you can tap into that thing and
you do it with language. But in my,

2224
02:12:27,640 --> 02:12:30,710
my crazy hallucination inside the tank,

2225
02:12:31,010 --> 02:12:35,450
I tapped into it with my mind and I
was locked in there and although I

2226
02:12:35,451 --> 02:12:39,890
understood what they were saying I
shouldn't have, it was very, very strange.

2227
02:12:39,940 --> 02:12:40,551
It was a very,

2228
02:12:40,551 --> 02:12:45,260
very strange because it wasn't as
simple as I was pretending that I could

2229
02:12:45,261 --> 02:12:46,370
understand what they were saying.

2230
02:12:46,610 --> 02:12:51,610
Like in my mind they were noises that
were coming out of their mouth were there

2231
02:12:52,341 --> 02:12:55,360
were rough reflecting in my mind.
My,

2232
02:12:55,520 --> 02:12:59,450
I was giving interpretations on those
noises and those noises were like,

2233
02:13:00,680 --> 02:13:04,040
they were there. They were normal for
like a normal communication like hey,

2234
02:13:04,041 --> 02:13:06,980
we've got to go down to the river and
we've got to pick up some water and be

2235
02:13:06,981 --> 02:13:10,100
careful because there's a snake that
someone saw that's near this log.

2236
02:13:10,610 --> 02:13:13,490
It was like that kind of shit,
but it was in a completely different,

2237
02:13:13,491 --> 02:13:17,510
but I didn't know what, you know
some weird fucking language though.

2238
02:13:17,600 --> 02:13:18,860
But it's always the same thing.

2239
02:13:18,861 --> 02:13:21,140
Like whenever you have something that's
really trippy that happens when you're

2240
02:13:21,141 --> 02:13:24,110
meditating or really trippy that
happens when you're dreaming.

2241
02:13:24,290 --> 02:13:28,820
It's very difficult to stay in
that state and not go, oh my God,

2242
02:13:28,821 --> 02:13:32,130
I'm having a lucid dream
and then you wake up. Yeah,

2243
02:13:32,850 --> 02:13:37,200
it's hard to do all that stuff. One of
the interesting things about shrimp fest,

2244
02:13:37,201 --> 02:13:41,240
when you're doing it with a bunch of
Comedians and you forget that you know,

2245
02:13:41,270 --> 02:13:44,640
you're out in the desert with seven guys
and sometimes you're all sort of like

2246
02:13:44,641 --> 02:13:47,130
spread out on a mountain top.
You know what I mean?

2247
02:13:47,131 --> 02:13:48,690
And sometimes we're together laughing,

2248
02:13:48,691 --> 02:13:53,220
but sometimes we would like break apart
and then you forget everything that's

2249
02:13:53,221 --> 02:13:56,910
happening and then all of a sudden
something hilarious happens. You know?

2250
02:13:56,911 --> 02:14:00,540
Like at 1.1 guy was like,
and we're in the middle of the desert,

2251
02:14:00,541 --> 02:14:02,370
like phones don't even work out there,

2252
02:14:02,400 --> 02:14:05,370
but I didn't know where you just here
because it's so quiet. It's beautiful,

2253
02:14:05,371 --> 02:14:09,570
quiet desert and you just hear one guy
go, oh shit, I just got a Tinder match.

2254
02:14:10,280 --> 02:14:12,420
Everybody just started dying

2255
02:14:14,590 --> 02:14:17,640
in the desert is trying to get laid.
Oh exactly.

2256
02:14:17,641 --> 02:14:20,100
And I mean so far away from civilization.

2257
02:14:20,580 --> 02:14:24,690
It's so funny like guys and
their desire to get laid.

2258
02:14:24,900 --> 02:14:27,420
I wonder if girls have the
same sort of conversations,

2259
02:14:27,421 --> 02:14:30,240
like constantly trying to figure
out how like single girls,

2260
02:14:30,241 --> 02:14:32,410
how they can get some Dick.
It's one of the

2261
02:14:32,480 --> 02:14:34,830
thing that we're,
one of the things that I really,

2262
02:14:35,330 --> 02:14:39,230
it really annoys me sometimes
if if a buddies too horny,

2263
02:14:39,290 --> 02:14:40,850
it annoys the shit out of me.

2264
02:14:41,160 --> 02:14:44,440
Worst is if you have a friend where
that supersedes everything. Yeah.

2265
02:14:44,500 --> 02:14:47,350
Like you go out with them and
they'll like, they'll like,

2266
02:14:47,351 --> 02:14:49,630
you're supposed to all be hanging
out together and they'll leave,

2267
02:14:49,631 --> 02:14:52,680
they get a booty call, they'll
leave, they get a text hanging out,

2268
02:14:52,890 --> 02:14:55,910
swiping on Tinder or they're,
you know, just, you know,

2269
02:14:56,030 --> 02:14:59,870
Jamie, this motherfucker heats
the entire time you're in Denver.

2270
02:14:59,871 --> 02:15:04,130
He never put his phone down and I was
encouraging my fucking comedy special and

2271
02:15:04,131 --> 02:15:06,780
he's in the green room. Go
over as Tinder matches. I was,

2272
02:15:06,790 --> 02:15:10,390
I was guilty of encouraging that though
because she really looks like this and

2273
02:15:10,391 --> 02:15:11,330
like get the fuck away from me.

2274
02:15:15,020 --> 02:15:18,320
Joe, you're shooting, you're
special in ten nine Joe,

2275
02:15:18,321 --> 02:15:20,900
what do you think about this chick?
She's missed too much makeup.

2276
02:15:22,040 --> 02:15:24,680
She's a kindergarten teacher.
Oh, it's probably a freak.

2277
02:15:28,040 --> 02:15:28,740
What is it?

2278
02:15:28,740 --> 02:15:32,360
The Tinder is like the number one and
then there's grinder for the gay folk.

2279
02:15:32,960 --> 02:15:36,830
Is there one that's like for
like people who have not sure

2280
02:15:39,230 --> 02:15:41,780
anything got in the middle of
Adam? No, I'm just fucking,

2281
02:15:41,781 --> 02:15:46,160
I dunno what I'm looking for. What
do you got to offer? What's for sale?

2282
02:15:46,161 --> 02:15:48,500
I'm not sure what I want for lunch.
Once on the menu.

2283
02:15:52,790 --> 02:15:56,990
Anybody that'll take
any, uh huh. Yeah. Yeah.

2284
02:15:57,150 --> 02:16:00,560
But the desperation, the
desperation to, to hook up

2285
02:16:00,780 --> 02:16:01,470
crazy.

2286
02:16:01,470 --> 02:16:06,360
And another thing is I can tell the
comedians that do stand up comedy just to

2287
02:16:06,361 --> 02:16:06,931
get girls,

2288
02:16:06,931 --> 02:16:11,250
guys that didn't get laid in high school
and college that figure it out later on

2289
02:16:11,251 --> 02:16:14,610
that need a second.
If I make people laugh and I go on stage,

2290
02:16:15,180 --> 02:16:17,700
the people that do just for checks.

2291
02:16:17,780 --> 02:16:18,960
Yeah,
that's annoying to you guys.

2292
02:16:18,980 --> 02:16:23,360
I'm trying really hard to be an actual
standard. Right, right, right, right.

2293
02:16:23,840 --> 02:16:27,440
Exactly. Those guys never, right. Exactly.

2294
02:16:27,490 --> 02:16:30,010
We have the same bits and once
they have bits that work, they

2295
02:16:30,010 --> 02:16:33,370
stick to those fucking things
like glue forever and you're like,

2296
02:16:33,371 --> 02:16:37,000
where's your new shit man?
Never going to see it. Yup.

2297
02:16:37,720 --> 02:16:40,820
That's a trap, Huh? Yeah. Whenever you,

2298
02:16:40,870 --> 02:16:45,310
you think about other motivations
other than the work itself,

2299
02:16:45,430 --> 02:16:48,580
the work itself suffers, you know, they
said they had, they did this thing,

2300
02:16:48,581 --> 02:16:53,581
they did the study on motivations and
the motivation of doing good work versus

2301
02:16:55,751 --> 02:17:00,340
the motivation of just trying to make
money and they found that the least

2302
02:17:00,341 --> 02:17:05,230
success was achieved when you had a
combination of the both because then you'd

2303
02:17:05,231 --> 02:17:09,250
be really distracted. The least
results. The worst results were,

2304
02:17:09,520 --> 02:17:12,610
were when someone was like,
I want to do good work,

2305
02:17:12,611 --> 02:17:17,050
but I want to make a lot of money. So
how do I do the work, make it good,

2306
02:17:17,051 --> 02:17:20,110
but try to make a lot of money.
Like that is the worst results.

2307
02:17:20,140 --> 02:17:23,140
And the best results were achieved when
they didn't think about the money at all.

2308
02:17:23,320 --> 02:17:28,000
But concentrated entirely on doing
good work. Yeah, no doubt about it.

2309
02:17:28,450 --> 02:17:30,680
I mean, I was always,
you know, the first, uh,

2310
02:17:30,700 --> 02:17:33,280
three or four years of me doing stand up,
moving out here,

2311
02:17:33,281 --> 02:17:38,281
I came out here with a carry on bag and
like $40 cash rolled into a job at a

2312
02:17:40,181 --> 02:17:44,950
restaurant, you know, but
I, I had nothing, nothing,
nothing, nothing, nothing.

2313
02:17:44,980 --> 02:17:47,100
And had I,
when I started standup,

2314
02:17:47,770 --> 02:17:52,060
dwelled and thought about the fact that
I'm crashing on my brother's couch and

2315
02:17:52,061 --> 02:17:56,200
then, um, you know, then I was renting out
a couch in another buddy's living room.

2316
02:17:56,201 --> 02:17:59,410
You know what I mean? And had I thought
about how this isn't normal and the,

2317
02:17:59,420 --> 02:18:02,590
you know, this sucks. I never would've
been able to write another joke, but,

2318
02:18:02,700 --> 02:18:04,750
and I had to write everything.
Everything I've written,

2319
02:18:05,230 --> 02:18:09,520
I mean everything I wrote back then I
wrote while completely broken, struggling.

2320
02:18:09,521 --> 02:18:11,890
So it's like you got to just ignore it.

2321
02:18:12,470 --> 02:18:16,130
Isn't it fascinating though that you can
only really have that kind of position

2322
02:18:16,131 --> 02:18:20,330
when you're young, when you're young
people accept it, it seems normal,

2323
02:18:20,720 --> 02:18:24,440
but if you found out that a dude was 40
and he was living on his brother's couch

2324
02:18:24,441 --> 02:18:27,530
trying to make it as a comedian, you
like, oh, you poor piece of shit.

2325
02:18:27,531 --> 02:18:29,680
That's a different situation
for sure. I, you know,

2326
02:18:29,700 --> 02:18:32,540
really never found what I was
looking for until last year,

2327
02:18:33,100 --> 02:18:36,230
decided to quit my job, had
a job at ups, was a good job.

2328
02:18:36,231 --> 02:18:38,570
I was in sales and then boom,

2329
02:18:38,600 --> 02:18:42,020
it's poor guys on someone's couch trying
to grind it out as a standup comic.

2330
02:18:42,080 --> 02:18:45,320
Yeah. Can't do it then
for sure. It's hard.

2331
02:18:45,321 --> 02:18:48,980
Even when you're in the later twenties
start getting into your thirties and

2332
02:18:48,981 --> 02:18:51,740
people go, oh, come on man.
Right. It might be time to,

2333
02:18:51,830 --> 02:18:56,030
might be time to bail on this.
Yeah. Got To do something.

2334
02:18:56,390 --> 02:19:00,140
You've got to supplement that income
somehow. Yeah. To supplement the income.

2335
02:19:00,170 --> 02:19:01,090
That's one thing.
But the,

2336
02:19:01,091 --> 02:19:04,910
the idea of the grand struggle of
like trying to make it as an actor,

2337
02:19:05,270 --> 02:19:07,790
like say someone's 45,
they decided I'm going to be an actor.

2338
02:19:08,180 --> 02:19:12,330
Good fucking luck man. Good luck. Right?

2339
02:19:12,380 --> 02:19:14,360
You're gonna want to start at 45.

2340
02:19:14,420 --> 02:19:17,330
Jimmy fucking people are out
there trying to be actors, right?

2341
02:19:17,790 --> 02:19:22,260
Most 45 year olds are going
to be auditioning against
for the same part of a 45

2342
02:19:22,261 --> 02:19:26,460
year old had been acting for 25 years.
So yeah, they started off as a teenager.

2343
02:19:26,770 --> 02:19:29,690
I think luck of beating them
in your audition. You know,

2344
02:19:29,900 --> 02:19:34,790
that's one thing that we have that we're
so fortunate as a standup comic that

2345
02:19:34,791 --> 02:19:38,750
you create your own stuff, you
deliver your own stuff, you design it,

2346
02:19:38,751 --> 02:19:42,920
you execute it, you produce it, all
of it is done by Tony Hinchcliffe.

2347
02:19:42,921 --> 02:19:46,490
When you get up there, it's 100%
uh, Tony Hinchcliffe production.

2348
02:19:47,030 --> 02:19:49,520
Whereas like if you are even in a band,

2349
02:19:49,790 --> 02:19:52,970
you'd have to deal with all the other
dudes in the band. And you know, man,

2350
02:19:52,971 --> 02:19:56,570
when am I going to do my drum solo?
And like, this is fucking drum solo.

2351
02:19:56,720 --> 02:19:57,130
Having to do

2352
02:19:57,130 --> 02:20:01,030
decide the words of the lyrics
and when the, all that stuff,

2353
02:20:01,330 --> 02:20:03,160
that's why bands can't last at all.

2354
02:20:03,190 --> 02:20:07,120
All my buddies that were
supposed to be huge Rockstar,

2355
02:20:07,890 --> 02:20:08,723
uh,

2356
02:20:08,920 --> 02:20:13,240
the couple of friends that I had that
are gurus on an electric guitar can play

2357
02:20:13,241 --> 02:20:16,420
it. If I can just do this,
this behind the back,

2358
02:20:16,421 --> 02:20:19,750
everything and they can play anything.
There's Stelling, Youngstown,

2359
02:20:19,960 --> 02:20:23,060
rotating new band members every
one to two years. Hey, tell him,

2360
02:20:23,061 --> 02:20:26,980
check out my new band. This
is a computer box dreams. Hey,

2361
02:20:26,981 --> 02:20:31,360
check out my new band. This is a
Buddha's mystery. Check out my new band.

2362
02:20:31,361 --> 02:20:36,240
Brick wall extreme. You know, it's
like dude, brick wall. We stream.

2363
02:20:36,490 --> 02:20:41,080
We, yeah, it's like you
got to go solo, go solo,

2364
02:20:41,081 --> 02:20:45,310
get rid of these rooms and yeah,
it's tough. Uh, bands crazy.

2365
02:20:45,311 --> 02:20:50,311
You think of a movie people don't realize
every single credit that they see at

2366
02:20:50,411 --> 02:20:54,580
the end of a movie is somebody that
could have ruined the movie. You know,

2367
02:20:54,581 --> 02:20:58,660
almost everybody has, if they don't
pull their weight, if the, you know,

2368
02:20:58,690 --> 02:21:01,510
whatever the script supervisor sucks,

2369
02:21:01,750 --> 02:21:05,240
that could ruin a great editors work
or vice versa. You know what I mean?

2370
02:21:05,290 --> 02:21:09,370
Editor can ruin a director,
director can ruin a producer.

2371
02:21:10,300 --> 02:21:14,350
Everybody has to pull their
weight. Whereas with standup
it's a one man machine.

2372
02:21:15,440 --> 02:21:19,670
Yeah and it's also like
you, you, you travel light,

2373
02:21:20,030 --> 02:21:22,760
you don't need a bunch of shit that you
have to take with you to the airport.

2374
02:21:22,880 --> 02:21:26,270
Right. You know, you just,
it's, it's just so much,

2375
02:21:26,300 --> 02:21:31,300
it's still hard to do but at least you
get like you get undeniable like you,

2376
02:21:33,351 --> 02:21:34,250
you can get good.

2377
02:21:34,280 --> 02:21:37,940
Like there's guys that we know that are
totally broke that are open miker is

2378
02:21:37,941 --> 02:21:40,700
that hang around with us.
Like they're in the same group.

2379
02:21:40,880 --> 02:21:44,750
Like when you show up at the comedy clubs
and then their shows and there's open

2380
02:21:44,751 --> 02:21:47,240
Mike shows and there's regular
shows is bringer shows.

2381
02:21:47,480 --> 02:21:49,550
Like everybody interacts with each other.

2382
02:21:49,560 --> 02:21:51,770
We interact with guys that
are just starting out.

2383
02:21:51,980 --> 02:21:56,390
We interact with guys that had been doing
it for years and if you fucking good

2384
02:21:56,391 --> 02:21:59,630
man, if you get those three minutes
and you crush those three minutes,

2385
02:21:59,960 --> 02:22:02,240
people want to put you on your
show and it might take a few years,

2386
02:22:02,241 --> 02:22:06,020
but a couple years later, you know
you're crushing. You do in 10 minutes,

2387
02:22:06,021 --> 02:22:09,050
you're crushing, you're doing 15 minutes,
you're crushing it. You're, you're right,

2388
02:22:09,051 --> 02:22:12,380
you're, you're bombing. You come back
better. You, you crush you, right?

2389
02:22:12,410 --> 02:22:16,220
You keep doing it, you get
undeniable. But if you're in a band,

2390
02:22:16,280 --> 02:22:17,840
you're never undeniable,
right?

2391
02:22:17,870 --> 02:22:22,400
Because there's some music
that you are not interested in.

2392
02:22:22,610 --> 02:22:25,890
Like WWE, if you are a guy who wants
to be a fucking country music guy,

2393
02:22:26,970 --> 02:22:30,120
you can make music all day.
But if you're in the wrong place,

2394
02:22:30,600 --> 02:22:34,170
if they don't like your kind of
stuff like you and you're just not,

2395
02:22:34,200 --> 02:22:37,740
you can never become undeniable. But
if you, you can make people laugh.

2396
02:22:37,980 --> 02:22:41,880
It's pretty universal. If you're a good
comic and you have 300 people there,

2397
02:22:42,120 --> 02:22:46,740
those 300 people who might have widely
different tastes when it comes to what

2398
02:22:46,741 --> 02:22:48,960
kind of music they like,
what kind of food they eat,

2399
02:22:48,990 --> 02:22:50,820
but you can get all 300 of them.

2400
02:22:50,821 --> 02:22:55,821
The laugh with something they've never
heard before to get all 300 of them to

2401
02:22:56,190 --> 02:23:00,360
really truly enjoy a song.
Very hard.

2402
02:23:01,470 --> 02:23:03,390
Yeah. The Ah, it's,

2403
02:23:04,220 --> 02:23:07,970
it's tough working with other people.
That's really the thing.

2404
02:23:08,930 --> 02:23:10,940
Being in a band, it's hard, man.

2405
02:23:11,060 --> 02:23:15,560
I can't even imagine having to put
up with somebody artistic opinion for

2406
02:23:15,561 --> 02:23:20,440
everything that you're going to end
up representing somebody telling you

2407
02:23:21,490 --> 02:23:23,470
what they think.
Yeah.

2408
02:23:23,500 --> 02:23:28,500
I'm trying to text dom Irrera to see if
I can get him to send us that song so we

2409
02:23:28,841 --> 02:23:33,820
can close with it. What did he do? He
wrote a song. Yeah. Does he sing in it?

2410
02:23:34,120 --> 02:23:36,450
Yeah. And it sounds
really professional. Like,

2411
02:23:36,750 --> 02:23:40,220
like it sounds like a real song that you
would here. It's really weird. Really?

2412
02:23:40,390 --> 02:23:43,960
Yeah. Dom, I rera he looks
good, dude. I'm telling you.

2413
02:23:44,500 --> 02:23:48,400
I didn't even know he was in that realm
whatsoever. Did I? It sounds like a joke.

2414
02:23:48,430 --> 02:23:52,330
He's always been a Beatles fan. Oh yeah.
Yeah. I mean, he's always been into music,

2415
02:23:52,331 --> 02:23:56,380
but it's fucking good. Like wow.
I was like, Whoa, this is weird.

2416
02:23:56,740 --> 02:23:59,440
But he's such a good comic.
When someone's that good.

2417
02:23:59,590 --> 02:24:04,000
I would imagine that anything that
he does essentially could be great.

2418
02:24:04,570 --> 02:24:06,640
You know what I mean? I'll wait.
I want to do is focus on it.

2419
02:24:07,520 --> 02:24:11,560
Trying to get him to quit drinking.
Hmm. He, uh, he brought it up.

2420
02:24:11,680 --> 02:24:14,350
I didn't bring it up. He brought it up
yesterday. He's like, I drank too much.

2421
02:24:14,351 --> 02:24:16,240
I wake up every day drunk.
What's good?

2422
02:24:16,270 --> 02:24:19,000
Better than what he said the first time
he was on where he was talking about

2423
02:24:19,001 --> 02:24:22,420
pills all the time and stuff. Remember
that? Xanax. Xanax. Yeah. Still on that.

2424
02:24:23,500 --> 02:24:28,450
But he takes a Xanax in the morning and
then, uh, by the time the Xanax wears out,

2425
02:24:28,451 --> 02:24:30,460
that's when he hits the booze.
Wow.

2426
02:24:31,670 --> 02:24:33,800
He's so funny.
He's hilarious.

2427
02:24:33,830 --> 02:24:37,330
It was so fun having you and him on kill
Tony together at the ice house. Yeah.

2428
02:24:37,340 --> 02:24:38,310
We were talking about that.

2429
02:24:38,460 --> 02:24:40,630
We were talking about how
fun that is. Yeah, yeah.

2430
02:24:40,830 --> 02:24:44,560
That's the one of the most beautiful
thing also about comedy is the comradery

2431
02:24:45,060 --> 02:24:48,410
fucking around with other comedians. You
know, like when we're on the road, dude,

2432
02:24:48,420 --> 02:24:49,980
me mean we do all these
gigs together and it's,

2433
02:24:50,040 --> 02:24:53,970
it's annoying that you got to go to
airport to hotel to say, but it's fun.

2434
02:24:53,971 --> 02:24:57,810
We're laughing. Oh yeah.
Which save us Sacramento.

2435
02:24:58,540 --> 02:25:02,620
Oh yeah. I said a Sacramento is
a, is a puppy mill for porn stars.

2436
02:25:03,970 --> 02:25:05,920
Just where they,
they just kick 'em out.

2437
02:25:07,020 --> 02:25:11,380
These chicks just come out wearing little
sweat pants and say juicy on the back.

2438
02:25:11,381 --> 02:25:16,060
Cute little butts and too little of a
shirt strolling through the airport all

2439
02:25:16,061 --> 02:25:20,410
looking like they're taking the next
flight to la just to land directly in the

2440
02:25:20,411 --> 02:25:22,990
valley to this list.
Certain

2441
02:25:23,650 --> 02:25:24,070
when like

2442
02:25:24,070 --> 02:25:27,550
do you go to a Burbank if
you leave Burbank to Vegas,

2443
02:25:27,820 --> 02:25:30,760
like would you can play that game.
Which one's a stripper? Right?

2444
02:25:30,770 --> 02:25:32,830
You could play that game.
Which girls are going to the rhino.

2445
02:25:32,880 --> 02:25:37,880
It's like there's a lot of gals that like
live in La and go to Vegas and make a

2446
02:25:38,591 --> 02:25:43,090
shit ton of money there over the weekend
and then fly back to La and I'm not

2447
02:25:43,091 --> 02:25:47,160
hating, I'm not mad at him. Right.
But it's fun to pick them out. Yeah.

2448
02:25:47,680 --> 02:25:50,940
And it's pretty easy to,
they always wear a troopy sweatpants.

2449
02:25:50,941 --> 02:25:55,080
Like they're playing it down like we're
not supposed to notice. Yeah. Right. Yeah.

2450
02:25:55,110 --> 02:25:57,960
Yeah. They don't wear like sexy
clothes. Probably so tired. Yeah.

2451
02:25:57,961 --> 02:26:01,110
That dude's fucking stand at their
box. Right. Well all the ugly girls,

2452
02:26:02,500 --> 02:26:07,230
all the ugly girls, they try to dress
up and the those ones try to dress down,

2453
02:26:07,231 --> 02:26:11,280
but it's too obvious cause they try too
hard to dress down. I'm just wearing a,

2454
02:26:11,610 --> 02:26:16,230
you know, just wearing a hoodie and a
pair of sweatpants. Yeah. It's important.

2455
02:26:16,290 --> 02:26:18,990
They're there to giving up their hand.
Right.

2456
02:26:20,090 --> 02:26:23,730
But sweat pants are hot on a girl. Super
Cute. And you see that little butt flap,

2457
02:26:23,731 --> 02:26:27,940
you know, or the cloth like sorta curls
up right underneath the butt cheeks. Oh.

2458
02:26:28,030 --> 02:26:30,810
Karolin sweatpants is so much
better than a hot chicken jeans.

2459
02:26:30,811 --> 02:26:33,240
You know what I mean? I mean,
I'm saying both hot checks,

2460
02:26:33,241 --> 02:26:34,110
but I'm saying I'd rather,

2461
02:26:34,111 --> 02:26:37,680
I'd prefer hot chicken sweatpants
then genes cause it's not the same.

2462
02:26:37,681 --> 02:26:39,760
You can't feel that.
Well if you grab a girl's ass and

2463
02:26:40,030 --> 02:26:40,271
pants,

2464
02:26:40,271 --> 02:26:43,120
it feels like you're grabbing a girl's
ass where if you grab a girl's ass and

2465
02:26:43,121 --> 02:26:47,920
tight jeans, it's like you are holding
on to something that's restrained. Right.

2466
02:26:48,040 --> 02:26:51,240
You know, it's like, like
a straight jacket. Yeah.

2467
02:26:51,260 --> 02:26:55,900
Like you got a straight
jacket on your posting. Thick,

2468
02:26:56,290 --> 02:27:01,090
thick canvas. Straight jacket that you've
stubbed your fucking box into. Yeah.

2469
02:27:01,360 --> 02:27:05,080
You know your, your legs or skin
tight like girls never wear like,

2470
02:27:05,130 --> 02:27:08,050
like these kinds of genes like loose
jeans. Nobody wears those. Right?

2471
02:27:08,080 --> 02:27:12,840
They wear jeans where they can barely
walk. Yeah. They're just shoved into them.

2472
02:27:13,090 --> 02:27:17,560
Yeah. How often you see a girl
with baggy jeans? It's super rare.

2473
02:27:18,330 --> 02:27:20,840
I don't know. When is the last
time I saw Esther pivot ski?

2474
02:27:23,830 --> 02:27:26,720
I haven't heard a fucking peep about her.
What's going on with Little Leicester?

2475
02:27:27,160 --> 02:27:29,520
Last time marriage.
She was working up in Nicole Richie.

2476
02:27:29,521 --> 02:27:32,580
She's doing a lot of MTV
stuff. Isn't that right? Yeah.

2477
02:27:32,730 --> 02:27:36,480
Tony talks are more probably,
what is she doing? Uh, she's, uh,

2478
02:27:36,510 --> 02:27:41,220
she just made a pilot,
uh, and, um, she's, uh,

2479
02:27:41,250 --> 02:27:46,200
she's working it, just doing her
thing, doing spots at the store.

2480
02:27:47,070 --> 02:27:47,780
Okay.

2481
02:27:47,780 --> 02:27:51,260
What's the big pause and look down,
look up, pause, look down, look up.

2482
02:27:51,261 --> 02:27:55,100
Just admiring this glowing
rock. There's some, uh,

2483
02:27:56,630 --> 02:28:01,370
there's a, uh, uh, thing that
I tweeted earlier today that,

2484
02:28:01,371 --> 02:28:06,050
uh, in one of its kind study
in international team of
neuroscientists and robotic

2485
02:28:06,051 --> 02:28:11,051
engineers have demonstrated the viability
of direct brain to brain communication

2486
02:28:11,191 --> 02:28:15,590
and humans and recently
published and, uh, some,

2487
02:28:16,550 --> 02:28:20,700
some uh, study in p l o s one. Um,

2488
02:28:21,450 --> 02:28:25,580
it's the novel findings describe a
successful transmission of information via

2489
02:28:25,581 --> 02:28:26,414
the Internet,

2490
02:28:26,480 --> 02:28:31,480
but between the intacs scalps of two
human subjects located 5,000 miles apart.

2491
02:28:33,350 --> 02:28:34,610
Whoa.
Okay.

2492
02:28:34,920 --> 02:28:38,400
The one to find out if one could
communicate directly between two people by

2493
02:28:38,401 --> 02:28:43,020
reading out the brain activity from one
person and injecting brain activity into

2494
02:28:43,021 --> 02:28:47,820
the second person and to do so across
great physical distances by leveraging

2495
02:28:47,821 --> 02:28:51,600
existing communication pathways.
That's fucking nuts, man.

2496
02:28:53,810 --> 02:28:54,643
Whoa.

2497
02:28:55,430 --> 02:28:59,810
So what they're essentially saying is
through the Internet there's sending

2498
02:29:00,470 --> 02:29:04,640
information directly from brain to brain.
So what we were talking about earlier,

2499
02:29:04,670 --> 02:29:05,690
yeah,
that's real.

2500
02:29:05,990 --> 02:29:09,800
Like there they are literally going to
be able to directly transmit like I'm

2501
02:29:09,801 --> 02:29:12,860
going to be able to look at
you and send you a message.

2502
02:29:13,220 --> 02:29:15,200
I won't even be able to
say I have to say anything.

2503
02:29:15,470 --> 02:29:18,380
I'll send you a message and that
message is going to go to your brain.

2504
02:29:18,381 --> 02:29:21,230
Like I'll have an idea like
check out this mother fucker is.

2505
02:29:21,770 --> 02:29:23,170
It's going to show up in your brain.
Check out.

2506
02:29:23,180 --> 02:29:27,530
This motherfucker knew like exactly or
not even going to have control over over

2507
02:29:27,550 --> 02:29:30,830
thinking a hundred years from now
they're just going to create tools.

2508
02:29:31,830 --> 02:29:32,870
Who are they though?

2509
02:29:33,170 --> 02:29:36,440
They are going to be subject to the
same shit that we're subject to.

2510
02:29:36,740 --> 02:29:40,670
Like this idea that there's a giant
club ball of people that are going to be

2511
02:29:40,671 --> 02:29:41,600
able to control this.

2512
02:29:41,840 --> 02:29:45,230
That might be the most ridiculous
aspect of conspiracy theories.

2513
02:29:45,740 --> 02:29:49,190
One of the most ridiculous
aspect key thing really happened.

2514
02:29:49,191 --> 02:29:52,100
You said that and that's why
I'm wondering murder dude.

2515
02:29:52,130 --> 02:29:54,980
They murdered a bunch of people.
That's a lack of communication.

2516
02:29:54,981 --> 02:29:56,960
They killed people.
I mean,

2517
02:29:56,961 --> 02:30:00,050
this is in the nineties this
is pre internet that all
this shit went down. Right?

2518
02:30:00,500 --> 02:30:01,333
I mean it was,

2519
02:30:01,520 --> 02:30:05,400
the Internet is essentially what's
blowing back against them right now. Yeah,

2520
02:30:05,450 --> 02:30:09,310
but that's more like a fucking game
of Thrones type scenario, right.

2521
02:30:09,440 --> 02:30:14,440
Than it is someone not being
able to control information
software or information

2522
02:30:14,631 --> 02:30:18,710
technology like this. You know, this is
a completely different sort of a thing.

2523
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:24,980
I just wonder, I wonder what we're going
to be like a thousand years from now,

2524
02:30:25,310 --> 02:30:27,800
we're going to be
completely unrecognizable.

2525
02:30:28,190 --> 02:30:32,660
The concept of what life is going to be
unrecognizable and the idea of privacy

2526
02:30:32,661 --> 02:30:37,350
is going to be hilarious.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2527
02:30:37,860 --> 02:30:42,480
It's going to be hilarious.
Flooded. There's no privacy stop.

2528
02:30:42,780 --> 02:30:47,760
We're the last people to
experience privacy until
the, until something happens.

2529
02:30:47,790 --> 02:30:51,150
Until there's some sort of a crash,
like a civilization crash,

2530
02:30:51,151 --> 02:30:55,020
like asteroidal impacts super volcano,
massive earthquake,

2531
02:30:55,150 --> 02:30:57,930
some power shut down or
things go back to normal.

2532
02:30:58,530 --> 02:31:00,480
We're going to be the last
people that experienced privacy,

2533
02:31:00,690 --> 02:31:03,200
like real true privacy.
Yeah.

2534
02:31:04,080 --> 02:31:07,140
Have you ever gone somewhere where you
got no cell phone signal and like stayed

2535
02:31:07,141 --> 02:31:10,710
there for days? Yeah. Yeah.

2536
02:31:11,040 --> 02:31:15,720
Where Joshua tree, but he can get phones
out there and get cell phones out there.

2537
02:31:15,870 --> 02:31:20,160
Not, not with sprint.
You can't, is that true?

2538
02:31:20,830 --> 02:31:23,580
Do you guys with ATNT making calls?
Did you get jealous? Same thing.

2539
02:31:23,581 --> 02:31:26,810
It's same thing at the comedy store.
My phone barely works there. Yeah,

2540
02:31:26,820 --> 02:31:29,000
but that's cause the comedy
store is a vortex. Yeah.

2541
02:31:29,250 --> 02:31:32,940
There's something going on that you could
have full fucking four bars when you

2542
02:31:32,941 --> 02:31:36,720
drive up that high at parking lot and
then you look at your phone once you step

2543
02:31:36,721 --> 02:31:41,550
into the fucking hollowed
walls. So true. It is so true.

2544
02:31:41,640 --> 02:31:45,660
Is it the lead parking
lot? Parking lot, please.

2545
02:31:45,980 --> 02:31:46,813
There's nothing.

2546
02:31:47,040 --> 02:31:49,450
Did you know that Paul is trying to
get people to stop smoking pot there?

2547
02:31:50,060 --> 02:31:52,820
I heard a rumor of this.
I haven't seen it directly.

2548
02:31:53,080 --> 02:31:56,150
I actually talked to Paula yesterday
for a moment in the parking lot.

2549
02:31:56,290 --> 02:31:58,670
I'm pretty sure I was smoking
pot while talking to them.

2550
02:32:03,260 --> 02:32:07,640
Um, you know, he's Paulie,
he's a, he's a, he's a, he's,

2551
02:32:07,790 --> 02:32:10,040
he's a character man.
Indeed.

2552
02:32:10,310 --> 02:32:14,380
Sort of like Donald Duck or yeah.
Yeah.

2553
02:32:15,950 --> 02:32:19,790
Like the undertaker.
Are they really going to try to do that?

2554
02:32:19,860 --> 02:32:21,920
Try to get people to stop
smoking pot of the comedy club.

2555
02:32:23,790 --> 02:32:25,410
Absolutely impossible.

2556
02:32:25,520 --> 02:32:28,710
That is something that could never be
done at the comedy store at the last thing

2557
02:32:28,711 --> 02:32:31,660
they want is their entire uh,

2558
02:32:32,680 --> 02:32:37,080
line up out on the sidewalk smoking
pot because they're not allowed sees,

2559
02:32:37,081 --> 02:32:38,400
does smoke pot wherever they are.

2560
02:32:39,410 --> 02:32:43,030
Lousy how layer? Yes. Like a smoking
lounge like they do at the airport.

2561
02:32:43,090 --> 02:32:45,370
They do have a smoking
lunch at the comedy store.

2562
02:32:45,490 --> 02:32:47,390
It's called everywhere around the comedy

2563
02:32:47,470 --> 02:32:51,520
store and inside of it. But they,
maybe they should have like a look.

2564
02:32:51,521 --> 02:32:54,400
You have to have like a card. You Swipe
it and you have a little membership.

2565
02:32:54,401 --> 02:32:58,060
You go in to the hotbox
buddies in their barbecued,

2566
02:32:58,150 --> 02:33:01,330
you go in there like if
you ever pass those smoking
things, especially in Europe,

2567
02:33:01,720 --> 02:33:05,920
like you don't realize how much people
smoke in other countries. Holy Shit.

2568
02:33:06,010 --> 02:33:08,540
Like I was in Germany.
I took these photos of it cause it,

2569
02:33:08,541 --> 02:33:12,010
it didn't seem real and it
had all these warnings on it.

2570
02:33:12,040 --> 02:33:17,020
It's like this smoking station where you
could go into this literally this glass

2571
02:33:17,021 --> 02:33:19,180
box and they created at the airport.

2572
02:33:19,450 --> 02:33:23,830
He's people went and it was filled with
smoke. It was so bizarre. Like we stopped,

2573
02:33:24,170 --> 02:33:26,890
it was me and Eddie Bravo. We stopped and
we, uh, we looked at it, we were like,

2574
02:33:26,891 --> 02:33:31,630
look in there. This is crazy.
Like these fucking people are,

2575
02:33:31,780 --> 02:33:35,710
they're all like surrounding themselves
with each other's smoke and they just

2576
02:33:35,711 --> 02:33:36,544
sit in there.

2577
02:33:37,530 --> 02:33:41,420
It was a really creepy, I remember being
at the Denver airport or somewhere,

2578
02:33:41,440 --> 02:33:46,440
some airport a few years ago and I at
a layover and I saw one of those and I

2579
02:33:47,911 --> 02:33:52,080
went inside and it was exactly like
the waiting room from beetle juice.

2580
02:33:52,081 --> 02:33:55,860
Like all these creepy like people with
like something missing or like something

2581
02:33:55,861 --> 02:33:58,470
weird and they're just
slowly smoking is awful.

2582
02:33:59,010 --> 02:34:02,430
Remember that waiting room from beetle
juice for the guy sprinkles dust on the

2583
02:34:02,431 --> 02:34:06,630
guys head and it shrinks. Beetle
juice holds up by the way. Doesn't go.

2584
02:34:06,680 --> 02:34:10,890
God Michael Keaton. Michael Keaton's
best work. Tim Burton's best work,

2585
02:34:11,160 --> 02:34:12,750
perhaps Danny Elfman's.
Best word.

2586
02:34:13,170 --> 02:34:17,360
Well, Michael Keaton's best work. Um,
and you've seen Batman and this is right.

2587
02:34:17,380 --> 02:34:18,213
Yeah. Yeah. Well,

2588
02:34:18,420 --> 02:34:22,240
I'll send Tim Burton. I mean, they
went into that post beetle juice,

2589
02:34:22,300 --> 02:34:26,250
two different characters, by the way.
I mean like the, you know, the both,

2590
02:34:26,300 --> 02:34:29,500
both amazing works of art in two different
takes from Michael Keaton. You know,

2591
02:34:29,501 --> 02:34:31,960
two was the Michael Keaton one
where he played a dude. It was like,

2592
02:34:31,961 --> 02:34:36,640
there's a hundred of them.
It's so funny. Is it? Oh,

2593
02:34:36,641 --> 02:34:41,410
it's so fun. Good. Oh yeah.
What about, um, the other one,

2594
02:34:41,470 --> 02:34:45,790
Johnny dangerously? Yeah. Yeah. I
don't think I've seen that though.

2595
02:34:45,791 --> 02:34:48,610
Him and Joe Piscopo. I've heard good
things about it, but I don't think,

2596
02:34:49,140 --> 02:34:51,670
but I'll hook once.
Michael Keaton's lawn.

2597
02:34:53,210 --> 02:34:56,800
I read a great interview about him
yesterday. He lives in Montana now,

2598
02:34:56,801 --> 02:35:01,060
hunts every day. Has Dogs,
goes to diners, you know,

2599
02:35:01,061 --> 02:35:05,530
just lives a normal, cool life. And people
just sort of like, oh, nice to meet you,

2600
02:35:05,531 --> 02:35:07,690
Mr Kayden Yang.
Glad that you live in the neighborhood.

2601
02:35:07,691 --> 02:35:09,490
And he lives like this low profile,

2602
02:35:09,790 --> 02:35:13,780
but he hunts every day and writes and
is always on the phone and he's looking

2603
02:35:13,781 --> 02:35:17,860
for the next gig but doesn't want to do
any it take and just anything cause you

2604
02:35:17,861 --> 02:35:22,810
still act. Oh yeah. Huh. When he finds
the thing that he's interested in,

2605
02:35:23,530 --> 02:35:25,670
I haven't seen him in anything
in a long time. You know,

2606
02:35:25,690 --> 02:35:27,240
it's weird when you see
a guy like that and they,

2607
02:35:27,520 --> 02:35:31,870
they kind of fade out a little bit. Yeah.
Well he's Sorta Chelan. I'm pretty sure.

2608
02:35:32,530 --> 02:35:33,760
I'm pretty sure he's a,

2609
02:35:34,590 --> 02:35:35,423
yeah.

2610
02:35:35,990 --> 02:35:40,000
I'm pretty sure he likes living
the mellow life showing us. Brian,

2611
02:35:42,420 --> 02:35:43,253
what is that?

2612
02:35:44,100 --> 02:35:48,120
That's Michael Keaton, the
movie. Yeah. That's what I
read is it say human foibles.

2613
02:35:48,180 --> 02:35:52,230
What human foibles give Birdman?
It's super human wing.

2614
02:35:52,260 --> 02:35:56,110
Foibles is a weird word to use. You ever
had anybody use it in a conversation?

2615
02:35:56,111 --> 02:36:00,310
I know what that means and I'm a wordsmith
and the writers need to be awards for

2616
02:36:00,311 --> 02:36:04,140
the don't know what foibles means. I
have no idea. I'm an honest word. Smith

2617
02:36:06,090 --> 02:36:11,090
foibles is a minor weakness or
eccentricity in someone's character.

2618
02:36:11,670 --> 02:36:14,160
They have to tolerate
each other's foibles.

2619
02:36:15,320 --> 02:36:16,153
Huh?

2620
02:36:17,250 --> 02:36:20,370
Jay, you don't remember this
part and uh, John that move,

2621
02:36:20,371 --> 02:36:22,410
we were just talking about
your testicles in you

2622
02:36:22,510 --> 02:36:25,660
and now I don't remember. I don't
remember Johnny dangerously that much.

2623
02:36:25,890 --> 02:36:28,030
It was really kind of remember
that now that I'm seeing it.

2624
02:36:28,140 --> 02:36:30,570
Yeah. It's just like guys
walking around with huge balls.

2625
02:36:31,220 --> 02:36:33,350
It's guys who are like,
Oh yeah,

2626
02:36:38,990 --> 02:36:42,890
this guys whose balls grow too big. So the
idea. Yeah, I think so. That is real man.

2627
02:36:42,930 --> 02:36:45,950
You ever seen those poor folks where
their ball swell up to the size of,

2628
02:36:46,250 --> 02:36:49,190
they've had them on television before.
He's got a weird nut

2629
02:36:51,240 --> 02:36:52,760
ball.
One Ball.

2630
02:36:53,550 --> 02:36:58,070
Does he ever gone to the doctor about
his ball mentions have rampant cancers

2631
02:36:58,460 --> 02:36:59,170
ignoring it?

2632
02:36:59,170 --> 02:37:02,290
I remember that video weight on the
end of June clam and it showed a,

2633
02:37:02,350 --> 02:37:05,890
and they had had like skittles in it.
It looked like a bunch of like weird.

2634
02:37:05,980 --> 02:37:10,120
No I don't, I don't have really any
intense recollections of his balls.

2635
02:37:10,121 --> 02:37:11,080
It was a weird time period.

2636
02:37:11,290 --> 02:37:13,600
You're saying are he's balls
look like they had skittles.

2637
02:37:13,890 --> 02:37:14,910
Yeah.
If you look at Geo clean,

2638
02:37:15,050 --> 02:37:18,830
did you taste the rainbow?
The Rainbow?

2639
02:37:20,190 --> 02:37:24,180
He couldn't help himself help
himself. Yeah, there's a, um,

2640
02:37:24,850 --> 02:37:29,330
I think he's in Michigan. Yeah. Who?

2641
02:37:29,530 --> 02:37:32,080
Michael Hayden Montana.
Is it Montana?

2642
02:37:32,130 --> 02:37:36,690
Yeah, I read the yoga is
amazing. Interview and Esquire.
Michael Keaton. I mean,

2643
02:37:37,260 --> 02:37:42,140
it's crazy. I couldn't believe how good
it was. So read it yesterday. Really? Ah,

2644
02:37:42,150 --> 02:37:46,410
so good. This guy's living a cool
life man, and he's just a cool dude.

2645
02:37:46,411 --> 02:37:50,190
This journalist, you know, explains
it. Like when I got the assignment,

2646
02:37:50,191 --> 02:37:51,240
here's what happened,

2647
02:37:51,241 --> 02:37:55,410
and I talked to Michael Keaton's manager
and here's what he told me I should

2648
02:37:55,411 --> 02:37:57,540
look into before I meet him.
Next thing you know,

2649
02:37:57,541 --> 02:38:01,530
I'm on a plane and Michael Keaton's
calling me at 6:30 AM like,

2650
02:38:01,531 --> 02:38:04,370
I hope it's not too early. I'll
meet you for lunch. Bobby Bell,

2651
02:38:04,380 --> 02:38:07,260
like Michael Keaton is just
the man pretty much, you know,

2652
02:38:08,260 --> 02:38:09,850
you're a big Fan,
huh?

2653
02:38:09,930 --> 02:38:13,890
Come on in. If anybody born in 1984,
if you don't like Michael Keaton,

2654
02:38:14,160 --> 02:38:14,993
then you know what?

2655
02:38:15,670 --> 02:38:16,050
Okay,

2656
02:38:16,050 --> 02:38:19,530
get out of the world. Go. Go for it.

2657
02:38:19,950 --> 02:38:23,910
Go to the ocean and
just swim the direction,

2658
02:38:24,930 --> 02:38:28,560
not of land, just keep swimming
until you're nothing. If you,

2659
02:38:28,561 --> 02:38:30,030
if you're anti Michael Keaton,

2660
02:38:30,240 --> 02:38:34,110
you're anti everything
that's good beetle juice.

2661
02:38:34,111 --> 02:38:37,200
The Best Batman multiplicity.
Is that a monster?

2662
02:38:37,200 --> 02:38:40,860
What does it mean? That movie he
played, uh, there was him and uh,

2663
02:38:40,920 --> 02:38:44,730
it was a couple that was renting
him and apartment and uh,

2664
02:38:44,790 --> 02:38:48,750
he didn't want to leave remembering
he was like some crazy scammer.

2665
02:38:49,560 --> 02:38:53,220
It was like a San Francisco is about
San Francisco because San Francisco has

2666
02:38:53,221 --> 02:38:57,180
like insane real estate. Remember
that? Yeah, I'll find it.

2667
02:38:59,250 --> 02:39:02,940
He um, yeah, it was like,
I forget the name of it,

2668
02:39:02,941 --> 02:39:05,610
but I think it was with a
dude from vision quest to,

2669
02:39:06,540 --> 02:39:09,510
did you ever see that movie vision
quest or the original vision quest?

2670
02:39:09,511 --> 02:39:12,130
The rest of the movie?
Yeah. Matthew Modine. Yeah.

2671
02:39:12,230 --> 02:39:16,530
Remember she didn't think he was in
that movie. Wow. Night shift. No.

2672
02:39:17,280 --> 02:39:20,280
No. Um, [inaudible] I
find that the squeeze,

2673
02:39:20,760 --> 02:39:25,050
it was like Pacific something or another
Pacific Heights. Yeah. Yeah. That's it.

2674
02:39:25,680 --> 02:39:29,880
That's it. That was a good fucking movie.
He's been reliable. He was in Noah's Ark,

2675
02:39:30,570 --> 02:39:32,970
the new beginning.
He was a voice of Noah.

2676
02:39:33,720 --> 02:39:38,370
What kind of a piece of shit was that
movie? Is that the one we watched? No,

2677
02:39:38,371 --> 02:39:39,570
we tried to watch.

2678
02:39:39,571 --> 02:39:44,250
You should say we tried to watch the
new Noah movie with Russell Crowe.

2679
02:39:44,430 --> 02:39:47,370
Holy Shit.
Shit was that bad.

2680
02:39:47,790 --> 02:39:52,620
And he only watched part of what was bad.
You didn't want you gave up?

2681
02:39:52,680 --> 02:39:55,980
Yeah, we all gave up Jamie game
up too. But I hung in there.

2682
02:39:56,100 --> 02:40:01,080
I fucking took more blows and
bolts. You I tapped. It was gross.

2683
02:40:01,170 --> 02:40:05,280
It was so bad. And then it got to like
sum, it became, at first it was like,

2684
02:40:05,520 --> 02:40:09,750
there was like monsters and stuff like
rock monsters and bad people and it was,

2685
02:40:10,150 --> 02:40:14,190
it was so like predictable and goofy.
But then when I got on the boat and

2686
02:40:14,220 --> 02:40:17,750
when they were dealing with the flood,
then it became like this weird, you know,

2687
02:40:17,760 --> 02:40:21,150
sort of like when walking dead
got all about people, you know,

2688
02:40:21,151 --> 02:40:22,620
and everybody got kind of bummed out.

2689
02:40:22,621 --> 02:40:26,070
It's just like interpersonal shit
between people. Yeah. That's what it is.

2690
02:40:26,071 --> 02:40:28,030
On this stupid boat with Noah.

2691
02:40:28,590 --> 02:40:30,810
You would think this story
would have a better arc, but

2692
02:40:34,450 --> 02:40:39,240
you send them a bit and help
yourself. Help yourself. I can't.

2693
02:40:40,300 --> 02:40:43,300
So what's new and Tony Hinchcliffe
slide. What's cracking? We got going on.

2694
02:40:43,710 --> 02:40:46,200
Fun Man. Just did it. Did
a lot of touring with you.

2695
02:40:46,201 --> 02:40:49,350
I'm really excited about
some little things coming up.

2696
02:40:49,351 --> 02:40:54,351
A little few writing projects that I
already sort of pitched and it's a waiting

2697
02:40:54,750 --> 02:40:58,140
for the good word for that, but really
I'm most excited about kill Tony.

2698
02:40:58,141 --> 02:41:01,680
I care about it a lot and I love it.
It should be a TV show.

2699
02:41:02,460 --> 02:41:04,950
I just love it. We're having
so much fun. Every Monday,

2700
02:41:04,951 --> 02:41:09,600
the last 10 episodes have been our best
episodes. It's running like a machine.

2701
02:41:09,630 --> 02:41:13,080
It's the room is packed.
Every Monday the there's buzz.

2702
02:41:13,530 --> 02:41:17,040
I feel like it's just
fun and cool and it's a

2703
02:41:17,800 --> 02:41:21,350
bringing it to Columbus, Ohio to, yeah.
Are you guys going to do it live? Yeah.

2704
02:41:21,540 --> 02:41:23,940
Now when you do it live, you
can use local comics. Yeah.

2705
02:41:24,000 --> 02:41:27,780
How many comics do you have in
Columbus? A lot. Yeah. I'm on me.

2706
02:41:28,110 --> 02:41:29,700
When I used to do open mic there,

2707
02:41:29,701 --> 02:41:32,580
there was at least 50 comics
that would sit there and all.

2708
02:41:32,640 --> 02:41:37,170
We would all have to audition in front
of other comics just to do three minutes.

2709
02:41:37,200 --> 02:41:41,610
No Shit. 50. Yeah, there was a
lot back then. Wow. I had no idea.

2710
02:41:41,740 --> 02:41:46,450
So many people uh, you know, asks,
I get a tweet a day at least. Hey,

2711
02:41:46,451 --> 02:41:48,940
bring it to Vancouver. How
are you, how do you pick,

2712
02:41:49,000 --> 02:41:51,280
like if for folks who don't
know how the show works,

2713
02:41:51,310 --> 02:41:55,040
everybody goes up and does a minute. How
many comics do you have on our show? A,

2714
02:41:55,041 --> 02:42:00,041
well usually about 20 to 30 sign up and
usually about 12 to 15 get on and you

2715
02:42:01,241 --> 02:42:04,690
decide how many go on,
how just it just depends.

2716
02:42:04,691 --> 02:42:08,350
See the part that's the part of the format
that's a little bit more loose is how

2717
02:42:08,351 --> 02:42:12,580
long we spend on each person is totally
dependent on how we feel with them up

2718
02:42:12,581 --> 02:42:13,414
there.
You know,

2719
02:42:13,730 --> 02:42:16,810
for folks who don't all the person that
was a minute and then the professional

2720
02:42:16,811 --> 02:42:19,510
comics goof on them. Oh,
we talked to them about,

2721
02:42:19,511 --> 02:42:23,380
and maybe maybe we try to coax them
into writing a new bit by asking them

2722
02:42:23,381 --> 02:42:26,860
questions about their life,
where they're from, Bobby ba or,

2723
02:42:26,890 --> 02:42:30,490
or font or goof on them.
Right. We had a guy wearing a,

2724
02:42:30,580 --> 02:42:33,490
what looked like cum stain shorts
on first, first day. He's like,

2725
02:42:33,491 --> 02:42:35,410
I came here all the way from Tuscaloosa,

2726
02:42:35,411 --> 02:42:39,250
Alabama to do my first set of stay in
bed and he's like wearing these terrible

2727
02:42:39,251 --> 02:42:42,070
shorts.
And of course I'm going to light him up.

2728
02:42:42,400 --> 02:42:44,600
He probably lives in silver
lake and its characters. Yeah.

2729
02:42:44,630 --> 02:42:49,220
I'm working on is probably totally fake.
Yeah. It's probably a hipster. Right?

2730
02:42:49,240 --> 02:42:52,820
It's just fucking with you just decided
to like make an art piece out of doing

2731
02:42:52,821 --> 02:42:54,310
like really bad obvious standup.

2732
02:42:54,330 --> 02:42:58,320
We used to make fun of people a lot
harder. Really? Yeah. What changed?

2733
02:42:58,410 --> 02:43:00,740
Death threats? No violence itself. No,

2734
02:43:00,750 --> 02:43:05,340
I think the show is a little bit cooler
and more positive and I found something

2735
02:43:05,341 --> 02:43:08,250
that I found out through the show because,
you know,

2736
02:43:08,280 --> 02:43:12,940
I like making fun of people and roasting.
It's definitely a part of my, uh,

2737
02:43:13,420 --> 02:43:16,480
whatever toolbox. But, uh,

2738
02:43:17,530 --> 02:43:21,520
I think the show organically grew.
I think it's more satisfying to give to,

2739
02:43:21,521 --> 02:43:26,470
for somebody to come up with something
that's genuinely funny and only they can

2740
02:43:26,471 --> 02:43:30,370
do and try to figure out what that is
and a short allotted amount of time.

2741
02:43:30,640 --> 02:43:35,590
It's like watching a baby, being born like
a little comedy baby, like if you know,

2742
02:43:36,340 --> 02:43:39,910
whatever the guys in
Indian guy from whatever,

2743
02:43:39,911 --> 02:43:42,400
and it turns out to be gay.
I don't know.

2744
02:43:42,810 --> 02:43:45,900
We just had Sinbad also on recently
and Jeff Garlin, which was,

2745
02:43:45,901 --> 02:43:49,140
you guys did that at the comedy
store, right? Yeah. Nice. Yeah,

2746
02:43:49,950 --> 02:43:52,140
we did. We've done most of
the episodes out of there

2747
02:43:54,480 --> 02:43:55,680
every Monday eight o'clock

2748
02:43:55,780 --> 02:43:59,140
comedy store and if anybody wants to sign
up how far in advance they have to get

2749
02:43:59,141 --> 02:44:02,770
there that day, that day. Yup.
Just show up. Do it. Just show up.

2750
02:44:02,800 --> 02:44:05,230
That's the same way with open
Mike there. Right. And still, Yup.

2751
02:44:05,380 --> 02:44:08,770
It's one of the few places like that
I like, um, the laugh factory sign up,

2752
02:44:08,771 --> 02:44:12,310
but you have to wait in line and then
you're waiting in line for like the next

2753
02:44:12,310 --> 02:44:15,010
week, right? Yeah. Yeah.
Just so crazy. Yeah.

2754
02:44:15,730 --> 02:44:19,330
Let's just torture people are going
to work for free for you, right?

2755
02:44:20,530 --> 02:44:24,710
Yeah. Well the idea is like to make
them work hard for some reason. Yes.

2756
02:44:24,790 --> 02:44:28,630
Make them earn it. Yeah.
I don't, I don't get it.

2757
02:44:28,790 --> 02:44:31,090
They could just as easily
have them go up that day.

2758
02:44:31,300 --> 02:44:34,030
And why do you have to have
them wait in line, you know,

2759
02:44:34,031 --> 02:44:36,190
make them sign up and then
pick from the people there.

2760
02:44:36,210 --> 02:44:37,370
It's not the same reason.

2761
02:44:37,460 --> 02:44:41,100
The laugh factory does everything that
they do because they think a line outside

2762
02:44:41,101 --> 02:44:44,580
of their place makes them
look busy. That's how they
do it. That's why they don't,

2763
02:44:44,640 --> 02:44:49,640
they'd rather not sell drinks on a patio
or an a back bar and upstairs or in

2764
02:44:51,571 --> 02:44:52,051
anything.

2765
02:44:52,051 --> 02:44:55,110
They'd rather make it look like it's
busy by putting a little line around the

2766
02:44:55,111 --> 02:44:59,220
front. That's their whole trek.
Yeah. Oh yeah. We got there.

2767
02:44:59,221 --> 02:45:02,190
So there's something happening. Look,
there's people waiting on a sidewalk.

2768
02:45:02,350 --> 02:45:06,600
You know, those are young comic standing
in 95 degree heat for no reason.

2769
02:45:06,601 --> 02:45:11,340
For five hours a day. Literally for
hours and hours. People will get there.

2770
02:45:11,650 --> 02:45:12,990
Yeah, I've passed by there. Uh,

2771
02:45:13,040 --> 02:45:17,560
I did Don [inaudible] podcast and it was
during the day and there was a bunch of

2772
02:45:17,561 --> 02:45:19,360
people that were there also.

2773
02:45:19,361 --> 02:45:22,410
Actually Eliza as podcasts I did out
of there recently during the day was a

2774
02:45:22,411 --> 02:45:22,811
bunch of people.

2775
02:45:22,811 --> 02:45:25,960
They're just sitting there for no fucking
reason and they have to stay there,

2776
02:45:26,560 --> 02:45:29,650
which is like insuring someone that
they can't make a living. Right?

2777
02:45:29,651 --> 02:45:32,410
Like you don't require anything of that.
I'm, why are you making them stay there?

2778
02:45:32,470 --> 02:45:36,640
Right. How hard is it? Jesus. Jamie
Masada. There's two days in a row.

2779
02:45:36,641 --> 02:45:38,250
We've been talking shit about you.
Yeah,

2780
02:45:38,430 --> 02:45:41,550
give a mile. It's the first 15
people or whatever. They get there,

2781
02:45:41,820 --> 02:45:43,570
but they'll make them wait all day.
Body

2782
02:45:43,580 --> 02:45:47,530
is very important by the,
we have to get them to sit in the,

2783
02:45:47,531 --> 02:45:51,680
we have system we teach, we
teach them. They do good job.

2784
02:45:51,710 --> 02:45:53,960
They do what we tell them
on the podcast. Joe? Nope,

2785
02:45:54,860 --> 02:45:57,140
I did a podcast with him and Dom
Arrera if you want to listen to it.

2786
02:45:57,170 --> 02:45:58,460
I love Jamie.
Don't get me wrong.

2787
02:45:58,550 --> 02:46:01,430
I do love the guy and the guy he
is responsible for keeping open.

2788
02:46:01,431 --> 02:46:06,350
One of the top clubs in the country in
that club is one of the best clubs in La,

2789
02:46:06,560 --> 02:46:09,860
which makes it one of the best clubs in
the country. Are you making that face?

2790
02:46:10,320 --> 02:46:11,153
Which I'm sorry.

2791
02:46:12,580 --> 02:46:15,130
No, no, I don't like
it. You don't like it?

2792
02:46:15,240 --> 02:46:18,920
I don't think the color is yellow and
blue and orange belong anywhere near

2793
02:46:19,000 --> 02:46:21,310
cause you're a dark man with a dark soul.
You Damn right baby.

2794
02:46:21,340 --> 02:46:23,460
That's why you should be dressed in gold,
dancing around going,

2795
02:46:23,590 --> 02:46:25,650
hey andro take a streak as my brows.

2796
02:46:28,860 --> 02:46:33,580
So silly. You're right though. To
something about comedy, like dark,

2797
02:46:33,640 --> 02:46:38,170
dark seems to be like, yeah, give
me a low ceiling pitch. Black, dark.

2798
02:46:38,350 --> 02:46:41,980
Just a mic and a mic. Stand. A stool.
That's all I fucking want. Red Kurt.

2799
02:46:41,981 --> 02:46:43,900
Speaking of which you're going
to be at the comedy works,

2800
02:46:43,901 --> 02:46:46,690
you're going to get a date there to
headline after you a work there with him.

2801
02:46:46,810 --> 02:46:51,760
Yeah. Amazing. Yeah. I was
so happy I picked that place.
She's, that's the spot. Yeah.

2802
02:46:51,761 --> 02:46:53,570
Wendy's awesome. She really is. Yeah.

2803
02:46:53,800 --> 02:46:56,620
But that,
that club is also like the perfect setup.

2804
02:46:56,920 --> 02:46:58,710
Like literally the
perfect setup for totally

2805
02:46:58,800 --> 02:47:03,540
hanging out with her was really
interesting because uh, you know,

2806
02:47:03,660 --> 02:47:07,710
I, I never really got to
hang with Mitzi and you know,

2807
02:47:07,740 --> 02:47:09,540
I know it's two different
people and everything,

2808
02:47:09,930 --> 02:47:14,930
but the amazing maternal energy that I
felt from her and like love of standup

2809
02:47:15,900 --> 02:47:20,900
comedy made me feel like I sort of got
it from like being a comedy store guy,

2810
02:47:24,271 --> 02:47:25,830
but in a post Mitzi era.

2811
02:47:25,831 --> 02:47:29,670
Like it was amazing to get to hang
with powerful comedy woman like that.

2812
02:47:30,320 --> 02:47:31,640
Yeah. She's awesome. Yeah.

2813
02:47:31,670 --> 02:47:34,400
There's only a few people like that in
the country that are responsible for

2814
02:47:34,401 --> 02:47:36,300
scenes. You know, like the,

2815
02:47:36,310 --> 02:47:41,310
the comedy scenes in cities can be
directly dependent upon like a single club

2816
02:47:41,601 --> 02:47:45,710
sometimes. Like cap city is like
a big one for Austin. Right.

2817
02:47:45,730 --> 02:47:48,800
That's another place we worked at
recently that that's like the hub.

2818
02:47:48,830 --> 02:47:52,880
That's the big spot in Austin
that is the big club in Austin,

2819
02:47:52,881 --> 02:47:56,690
Texas and there's like a few of
those all across the country.

2820
02:47:57,170 --> 02:48:00,770
It's a kind of amazing that they haven't
like tried to move in with an Improv in

2821
02:48:00,771 --> 02:48:04,430
Austin. Like how, how's the
Improv missed on Austin, Texas?

2822
02:48:05,180 --> 02:48:08,480
You mean they have one in
Houston but it doesn't,

2823
02:48:08,540 --> 02:48:12,920
it's kind of an a sketch neighborhood
apparently, but there's no more other,

2824
02:48:12,950 --> 02:48:15,650
like there's no more independent
club in Houston anymore.

2825
02:48:15,980 --> 02:48:19,280
They used to be the last stop, which is
like the one of the greatest of all time.

2826
02:48:19,510 --> 02:48:24,200
And that club, the laugh stoppers
responsible for Bill Hicks,

2827
02:48:24,500 --> 02:48:25,670
Sam Kinison,

2828
02:48:26,270 --> 02:48:31,270
even Janeane Garofalo I think did
a lot of her early stuff out of,

2829
02:48:31,701 --> 02:48:36,080
uh, out of the last stop. It was just
a completely different kind of club.

2830
02:48:36,560 --> 02:48:40,850
And that one club like defined
that whole town's comedy scene,

2831
02:48:40,880 --> 02:48:42,020
Houston at one point in time,

2832
02:48:42,170 --> 02:48:44,570
it was like one of the best
comedy scenes in the country.

2833
02:48:44,840 --> 02:48:48,860
Like some of the best up and coming young
talent was coming out of Houston was

2834
02:48:48,861 --> 02:48:49,131
weird.

2835
02:48:49,131 --> 02:48:53,090
But that club goes under that one club
goes under and then the whole thing just

2836
02:48:53,091 --> 02:48:56,150
kind of like drifts off. It's
hard. It's hard to keep a scene.

2837
02:48:56,151 --> 02:48:59,540
So when you find someone like Wendy,
you gotta appreciate the fuck out of them.

2838
02:48:59,780 --> 02:49:02,440
Yeah, and I loved that. You
know what I mean? I mean,

2839
02:49:02,950 --> 02:49:07,590
any, anybody who had seen me
talking a bunch of crazy dark,

2840
02:49:07,860 --> 02:49:12,090
evil stuff before you and go, hey, you're
cool. You want to do a weekend here?

2841
02:49:12,091 --> 02:49:13,470
Like it's like,
wow,

2842
02:49:13,960 --> 02:49:15,010
we're talking about you're funny.

2843
02:49:15,250 --> 02:49:19,390
Yeah. But you know, everybody's always
looking for an excuse. Why to not,

2844
02:49:19,900 --> 02:49:23,770
even though it's funny, it's like if
everybody is always like, ah, you know?

2845
02:49:24,610 --> 02:49:27,370
Yeah. So dark. You know? Why don't
you, why don't you do some more

2846
02:49:27,850 --> 02:49:30,480
saying so dark? You're just
funny, man. You know it's not,

2847
02:49:30,490 --> 02:49:34,330
it's not like it's disgusting or
something ridiculous. Like, do you, you,

2848
02:49:34,331 --> 02:49:37,840
you looking down on your
own act or something? Like
what he'd done like so dark,

2849
02:49:37,841 --> 02:49:40,210
so dark.
I just can not that dark.

2850
02:49:40,340 --> 02:49:42,920
Well, I always get told, oh,

2851
02:49:42,921 --> 02:49:45,920
people's theories on
why this and why that,

2852
02:49:46,280 --> 02:49:50,060
I don't know why things aren't happening.
Right. What are you talking to? Agents.

2853
02:49:50,120 --> 02:49:53,990
Managers. Yeah. Those, those people. You
shouldn't, you shouldn't talk to them.

2854
02:49:54,090 --> 02:49:56,850
You know what? My manager told me the
other day, please tell me. He goes,

2855
02:49:57,360 --> 02:50:01,740
you need to, you need to not be so much
of a wrestling villain. Like you're like,

2856
02:50:01,770 --> 02:50:04,800
you're like a pro wrestling villain
and I don't think that goes well with

2857
02:50:04,801 --> 02:50:07,430
standup comedy. Nobody's ever done
that before. And I go, Gee, here,

2858
02:50:07,550 --> 02:50:10,760
you just said, I go, nobody's ever
done that before. You just said it.

2859
02:50:12,290 --> 02:50:16,560
He's an idiot. You got a new
one, your manager. I can't,

2860
02:50:16,770 --> 02:50:19,070
I can't tell someone that
too much of an anything.

2861
02:50:19,100 --> 02:50:20,870
He doesn't have any idea why you're funny.

2862
02:50:21,080 --> 02:50:25,010
No one has any idea why you're funny other
than, you know, it sounds ridiculous,

2863
02:50:25,050 --> 02:50:26,180
but you're absolutely right.

2864
02:50:26,210 --> 02:50:29,390
The only people that can help you or
other pro comics that work with you that

2865
02:50:29,391 --> 02:50:32,420
kind of see things, they will. Maybe
if you're this or maybe if you're that,

2866
02:50:32,421 --> 02:50:35,600
and then you take it into consideration
and knowing it's coming from someone who

2867
02:50:35,601 --> 02:50:37,190
actually knows what they're talking about,

2868
02:50:37,460 --> 02:50:41,600
but someone who's never done stand up
trying to tell you what does or does not

2869
02:50:41,601 --> 02:50:44,600
make you funny. They can't
do it. They can't do it.

2870
02:50:44,830 --> 02:50:49,160
It's just a wasted conversation,
buddy. You should be generation x guy.

2871
02:50:49,640 --> 02:50:50,570
Go on stage.

2872
02:50:50,600 --> 02:50:55,310
Everything come out of your
mouth is about generation X.

2873
02:50:55,310 --> 02:50:56,360
Jamie Masada actually said
that to one of my friends.

2874
02:50:56,490 --> 02:50:59,580
You know what Jamie told me? I've told
you this right? I have the best one ever.

2875
02:50:59,610 --> 02:51:01,410
Yes, please. You still have to do the, Oh,

2876
02:51:01,411 --> 02:51:05,280
you would wait for hours to do the open
mic and then you go in everybody if you

2877
02:51:05,281 --> 02:51:07,620
willing to do that,
if you stick around after the open mic,

2878
02:51:07,621 --> 02:51:09,840
you can go up to Jamie and eaten
the owner of the land victory.

2879
02:51:09,841 --> 02:51:13,320
Jamie will give you his advice
on your career. What he said.

2880
02:51:13,321 --> 02:51:17,370
Yeah Buddy Buddy. Very
funny. You wear a cowboy hat.

2881
02:51:17,371 --> 02:51:20,820
Do you make it to come back with
cowboy hat? They put you on stage.

2882
02:51:21,050 --> 02:51:22,560
So did you,
I took,

2883
02:51:23,640 --> 02:51:27,820
I didn't, I didn't go back
as a cartoon. It's me.

2884
02:51:28,570 --> 02:51:29,470
You're gonna die.

2885
02:51:32,100 --> 02:51:34,690
Did you think about it like thinking
if you came back with the cowboy hat at

2886
02:51:34,691 --> 02:51:37,180
least you'd get another spot.
No, that'd be a funny bit.

2887
02:51:37,181 --> 02:51:39,070
If you had a fucking cowboy hat
that you kept in your trunk,

2888
02:51:39,071 --> 02:51:43,780
just we do the laughter.
Right. Gotcha. Great idea.

2889
02:51:44,170 --> 02:51:45,670
Fucking Jamie.

2890
02:51:46,240 --> 02:51:50,260
Hey, it's Tony Hinchcliffe. Hey, I took
your advice. Got The hat. Cowboy hat.

2891
02:51:50,620 --> 02:51:52,900
Shit's been booming. Do you
ever do the laugh factory? Yeah,

2892

before I do a Ari's a TV show.

2894
02:51:57,430 --> 02:51:59,860

laugh factory Tuesday night.

2895

Hinchcliffe on Twitter.

His Twitter handle is Tony Hinchcliffe.

but it does not.

2901
02:52:23,080 --> 02:52:27,760
I don't understand. I've went looking,
but it just doesn't seem to be up there.

2902
02:52:28,270 --> 02:52:29,710
