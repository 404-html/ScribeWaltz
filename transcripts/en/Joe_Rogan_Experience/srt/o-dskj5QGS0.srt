1
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:05,070
Freak bitches made a point
to be a fucking mute.

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:06,293
Right.

3
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:09,240
And I actually like pull
it off and I was like,

4
00:00:09,241 --> 00:00:09,571
wow,

5
00:00:09,571 --> 00:00:10,680
like this shit is real,

6
00:00:10,681 --> 00:00:10,921
you know,

7
00:00:10,921 --> 00:00:11,620
and,

8
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:11,900
and,

9
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:12,121
and,

10
00:00:12,121 --> 00:00:12,750
and,

11
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:15,450
and the time that I really saw it as a.

12
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:15,901
sorry,

13
00:00:15,901 --> 00:00:16,160
let me,

14
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:16,501
it was,

15
00:00:16,501 --> 00:00:16,801
it was,

16
00:00:16,801 --> 00:00:17,071
I mean,

17
00:00:17,071 --> 00:00:17,691
I was in Canada.

18
00:00:17,691 --> 00:00:19,470
Is before the no talking thing.

19
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:25,310
I was at some restaurant and Ron Perlman's
manager came over to me and the actor

20
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:29,330
for that.

21
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:29,960
Yeah,

22
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,050
Hellboy in hell.

23
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:32,130
So that's a real shit,

24
00:00:32,131 --> 00:00:32,431
you know,

25
00:00:32,431 --> 00:00:33,264
he's a real dude.

26
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,050
Yeah.

27
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:37,170
So He'd come over and he's telling me
about this new movie that he wants to do

28
00:00:37,171 --> 00:00:37,891
and there's like a,

29
00:00:37,891 --> 00:00:38,490
um,

30
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:41,880
there's a dad and there's a song or
grandfather's son and dad and they're all,

31
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:42,150
you know,

32
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:43,390
they're all in the military,

33
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:43,981
different wars.

34
00:00:43,981 --> 00:00:47,550
And he was talking to me about
maybe playing the son and uh,

35
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:48,570
and we're having,

36
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:48,860
you know,

37
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:51,840
and I was interested in it because I'd
done a little bit of acting up until

38
00:00:51,841 --> 00:00:52,110
then.

39
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:52,800
And so I was like,

40
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:53,010
you know,

41
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:53,340
kind of,

42
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:53,551
you know,

43
00:00:53,551 --> 00:00:54,080
trying to,

44
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:54,360
you know,

45
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:54,841
check it out.

46
00:00:54,841 --> 00:00:59,841
And so I remember it was like every 30
seconds or minutes somebody to come up

47
00:01:00,181 --> 00:01:01,230
and ask you for a picture.

48
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:05,340
And after like the 20th person,

49
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:07,320
somebody came up and was like,

50
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:08,440
oh Ron,

51
00:01:08,441 --> 00:01:08,661
like,

52
00:01:08,661 --> 00:01:08,920
you know,

53
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:11,850
I love a picture with you
and I'll never forget it.

54
00:01:11,851 --> 00:01:13,230
I'll never forget for the rest of my life.

55
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:14,400
He stood up and he goes,

56
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,060
oh,

57
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:15,930
you want a picture of me?

58
00:01:15,931 --> 00:01:16,141
Like,

59
00:01:16,141 --> 00:01:16,891
who the fuck am I?

60
00:01:16,891 --> 00:01:18,180
You sure you don't want
a picture of this guy?

61
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:19,410
And he was kidding.

62
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:20,760
But I was just like,

63
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:21,181
I was like,

64
00:01:21,181 --> 00:01:21,511
wow,

65
00:01:21,511 --> 00:01:23,100
like this is so fucking crazy.

66
00:01:23,101 --> 00:01:26,380
Now here's a guy that's like
a super successful actor.

67
00:01:26,381 --> 00:01:26,940
He's been in like,

68
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:27,300
you know,

69
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:29,790
big TV series and like,

70
00:01:29,791 --> 00:01:31,890
all these people are asking
you to take a picture with me.

71
00:01:31,891 --> 00:01:32,491
And I was just like,

72
00:01:32,491 --> 00:01:32,761
wow,

73
00:01:32,761 --> 00:01:32,941
like,

74
00:01:32,941 --> 00:01:33,840
this is so fucked,

75
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:34,733
like.

76
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:35,820
But it was real.

77
00:01:35,821 --> 00:01:36,301
I was just like,

78
00:01:36,301 --> 00:01:36,541
wow,

79
00:01:36,541 --> 00:01:37,470
this is like a real thing.

80
00:01:37,471 --> 00:01:38,340
This isn't just like,

81
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:38,641
you know,

82
00:01:38,641 --> 00:01:39,750
numbers on the Internet.

83
00:01:39,751 --> 00:01:43,020
This is like I'm in a foreign country
and I got all these fucking people coming

84
00:01:43,021 --> 00:01:43,230
up,

85
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:43,531
you know,

86
00:01:43,531 --> 00:01:44,364
like I was.

87
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,360
I was kind like,

88
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:46,950
I was dumbfounded.

89
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:47,900
You got a card on you?

90
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:50,150
What are you just going to pull
out his Goddamn Mongo card?

91
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:51,013
I don't believe this.

92
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:53,053
When he got in there,

93
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:54,110
it's got a wallet.

94
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:55,610
He's going to pull out a Mongo card.

95
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:56,533
Let's see.

96
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:59,030
Right next to his Disneyland Year Pass.

97
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:00,000
Oh,

98
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,920
let me see here.

99
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:01,903
I've got to Disneyland.

100
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:02,930
I paragraph to find it.

101
00:02:02,931 --> 00:02:03,640
No,

102
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,030
cause I tuck it away.

103
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:06,560
So I actually,

104
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:10,880
you have a Mongo card?

105
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,950
I would think that you
would need a tattoo.

106
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:13,700
I would say.

107
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:14,360
Listen Bitch,

108
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,550
if you really want to be down for life,

109
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:18,410
we're going to get you a tattoo.

110
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:20,510
I already have a tattoo of the Mongols.

111
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:21,373
No.

112
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:22,550
What is it?

113
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:23,650
Like a UDP tattoos?

114
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:26,370
I have the try the Budweiser Trident and

115
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:29,940
you'll try and find your Mongo card.

116
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,290
How many of those cards you actually mine.

117
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:34,260
Look at that and there's
the card from Geo.

118
00:02:34,261 --> 00:02:39,261
The Hollywood pres gave me his last
time I saw on Bam motherfuckers legit,

119
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:41,730
too legit to quit.

120
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:42,930
That's hilarious.

121
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:44,880
That is hilarious.

122
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:46,500
And My name was.

123
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:48,380
I Dunno.

124
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:48,811
What was your name?

125
00:02:48,811 --> 00:02:49,680
Find it on there.

126
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:51,990
You never go by your real name?

127
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:52,883
Superman.

128
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:53,723
Superman.

129
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:54,603
Super.

130
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:56,731
Why'd they call you sue?

131
00:02:56,731 --> 00:02:57,510
Superman.

132
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:02,050
Because I was in such a physical specimen
that when I was prospecting they make

133
00:03:02,051 --> 00:03:04,780
you do pushups and stuff and I liked it.

134
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:06,281
Oh,

135
00:03:06,281 --> 00:03:08,350
so this is back in the
Jesse before the Jesse,

136
00:03:08,351 --> 00:03:09,240
the body Ventura.

137
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:14,200
This is back when I was transitioning out
of the seals into civilian life and in

138
00:03:14,201 --> 00:03:19,201
fact if there's a good transition I can
tell you about that shows how a book

139
00:03:19,691 --> 00:03:23,020
should do due diligence
before they write something.

140
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:28,380
There was a book written by William
Queen and atf agent who infiltrated the

141
00:03:28,511 --> 00:03:29,344
Mongols.

142
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:34,560
It's called under an alone
and he infiltrated them
and put like 25 of them in

143
00:03:34,661 --> 00:03:35,494
prison.

144
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:35,921
Well,

145
00:03:35,921 --> 00:03:40,150
in the book they wrote that I
was a former Mongol governor,

146
00:03:40,151 --> 00:03:41,080
Jesse Ventura,

147
00:03:41,081 --> 00:03:41,681
blah blah blah,

148
00:03:41,681 --> 00:03:41,881
blah,

149
00:03:41,881 --> 00:03:42,051
blah,

150
00:03:42,051 --> 00:03:42,311
blah.

151
00:03:42,311 --> 00:03:42,880
Right,

152
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:43,061
right.

153
00:03:43,061 --> 00:03:45,970
You know what they did before
the book was published?

154
00:03:45,971 --> 00:03:48,220
They sent me an entire copy of the book.

155
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,000
They said,

156
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,481
governor,

157
00:03:49,481 --> 00:03:51,880
please read this and if
you have any problems,

158
00:03:51,881 --> 00:03:52,714
call us.

159
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,040
So I read the book.

160
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:56,920
I didn't hide from the fact
that I was in the Mongols.

161
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:58,023
I never do,

162
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:02,260
but I did want them to change
something and they did.

163
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:03,310
When I called them,

164
00:04:03,311 --> 00:04:04,090
I said,

165
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:09,070
you stated the history of the Mongols
that we started off like all white

166
00:04:09,071 --> 00:04:12,010
supremist outlaw motorcycle clubs.

167
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,030
I said,

168
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:16,340
I would never joined anything
that was white supremacy.

169
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:17,590
I said to me,

170
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:21,790
a biker is a lifestyle and the color
of your skin has nothing to do with it.

171
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:23,103
And I said,

172
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:25,810
and the Mongols were not white supremacy.

173
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:27,190
And she said to me,

174
00:04:27,191 --> 00:04:27,371
well,

175
00:04:27,371 --> 00:04:28,120
governor,

176
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,530
how can you prove that?

177
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:31,210
I started laughing.

178
00:04:31,211 --> 00:04:31,571
I said,

179
00:04:31,571 --> 00:04:33,190
I think I can prove it easily.

180
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:33,761
She goes,

181
00:04:33,761 --> 00:04:34,511
tell me this.

182
00:04:34,511 --> 00:04:36,160
They editor at random house.

183
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:37,450
I said,

184
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:40,810
at what time did Mexicans
become white supremacists?

185
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,810
Because I said the Mongols
are 75 percent Latino,

186
00:04:43,811 --> 00:04:44,644
Mexican.

187
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:49,390
I was one of the few white guys who
could ride into east la and never be

188
00:04:49,391 --> 00:04:51,040
bothered because of my patch.

189
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:53,410
Uh,

190
00:04:53,411 --> 00:04:56,950
so how can you call us what the
Mongols started because they weren't.

191
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:59,740
Mexicans weren't allowed
in the hell's angels.

192
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:01,061
See,

193
00:05:01,061 --> 00:05:01,920
I sold it.

194
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:06,760
So the Mongols were the Mexican bikers
started their own bike club because they

195
00:05:06,761 --> 00:05:08,410
weren't allowed to be angels

196
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:13,830
and these pigeons are eating from the
top of it and they're so stupid that they

197
00:05:13,831 --> 00:05:16,160
just get sucked into the grave,

198
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:18,630
Jesus and chopped up into that bread.

199
00:05:18,631 --> 00:05:21,030
So like if you've had
bread in Russia lately,

200
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:25,600
a lot of his page and page
share this video to down.

201
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:27,270
Oh my God.

202
00:05:27,271 --> 00:05:28,130
Three down to

203
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,540
one of them falls and lands
in and just get sucked in at.

204
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:34,374
This is this,

205
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,710
this is fucking insane.

206
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:39,240
It's one of the most disturbing.

207
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:42,270
Jamie immediately make a video of this.

208
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:45,210
Send it to my phone so
I can instagram this.

209
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:46,860
The world needs to know more.

210
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:48,351
Yeah,

211
00:05:48,351 --> 00:05:49,320
it's a fuck.

212
00:05:49,321 --> 00:05:50,154
That's harsh.

213
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,950
It's very gross and scary and sad.

214
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:55,500
How it's just a harsh life.

215
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,620
A dumber to.

216
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:58,461
Well look,

217
00:05:58,461 --> 00:06:00,410
I'll where their heads are mad
if your head was that little.

218
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:01,731
Yeah,

219
00:06:01,731 --> 00:06:02,360
I guess,

220
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,193
but

221
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:07,510
yeah,

222
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:10,820
so I mean Zika babies grow
up to be pretty smart.

223
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:11,390
Nope,

224
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:12,260
we haven't had any.

225
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:13,280
That's true.

226
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,320
Actually it hasn't grown up are really.

227
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:16,213
I don't think so.

228
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:16,940
I mean,

229
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:18,020
not that I've ever heard of.

230
00:06:18,021 --> 00:06:18,800
I just made that up.

231
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,810
I think there's actually
adult Zika babies.

232
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,610
I think so because I was thinking
about making Zika hats for Zika people,

233
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:26,300
so it makes it look like
their heads are bigger.

234
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:31,870
My Dad grew up in the jungle.

235
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,700
What jungle in India.

236
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:34,803
Oh Jesus.

237
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:39,870
So literally when he hunted
tigers leopards a wild boar.

238
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:42,640
Jesus Christ.

239
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:44,200
Yeah.

240
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,700
Your Dad did that data a lot,

241
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:46,000
man.

242
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,170
It was born in 1925,

243
00:06:47,171 --> 00:06:48,360
so you know,

244
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:49,203
back then it was,

245
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:51,610
it's not like he would hunt them for fun,

246
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:53,471
but yeah,

247
00:06:53,471 --> 00:06:54,430
it was a big game hunter.

248
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:55,593
Wow.

249
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,820
We have a tiger skin with a head.

250
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:59,150
Holy Shit.

251
00:06:59,151 --> 00:06:59,450
Yeah.

252
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:02,710
This last one that he shot was in
the sixties when it was already.

253
00:07:02,711 --> 00:07:03,780
It was already banned.

254
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:04,890
You weren't allowed to shoot tigers in.

255
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,190
But the,

256
00:07:06,191 --> 00:07:07,024
uh,

257
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:11,590
this man eater went to a village and
was killing people in the village.

258
00:07:11,591 --> 00:07:13,240
So they had asked my dad to,

259
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,650
can you go get this,

260
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:15,903
can you go,

261
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,680
we know your family is a bunch of hunters,

262
00:07:17,681 --> 00:07:19,120
can you go get this tiger for us?

263
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,141
And he's like,

264
00:07:20,141 --> 00:07:20,221
well,

265
00:07:20,221 --> 00:07:20,770
what's in it for me?

266
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:21,280
And they were like,

267
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,290
we'll give you $15.

268
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:26,070
Like that was a lot like it.

269
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:27,550
It was equivalent to that.

270
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,260
Somebody's saying to you today,

271
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:30,640
I'll give you $15.

272
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:31,630
Wow.

273
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:32,380
And uh,

274
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:32,741
he said,

275
00:07:32,741 --> 00:07:32,861
well,

276
00:07:32,861 --> 00:07:34,210
how about you keep your money?

277
00:07:34,211 --> 00:07:35,080
I get to keep the skin.

278
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:37,900
So they made like an
exemption and they were like,

279
00:07:37,901 --> 00:07:38,360
yeah,

280
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,380
because he's getting a manometer.

281
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:40,770
It wasn't like he was
just randomly coming.

282
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:42,130
Tiger boy,

283
00:07:42,131 --> 00:07:42,964
that's a monster

284
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:44,680
here.

285
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,820
I'll tell you exactly how he did it.

286
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:46,691
I remember the story.

287
00:07:46,691 --> 00:07:47,524
Clearly he would.

288
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:48,070
He got,

289
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:50,680
he went to where there was
two trees side by side.

290
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:55,540
So he built up a little fort in this
one tree and then he tied a bull,

291
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:58,060
a blu walks around the other tree,

292
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:02,560
and then he went and sat up
in the tree at around five,

293
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:07,630
6:00 in the evening and he sat there
and I'm reading magazines and stuff.

294
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:08,690
And uh,

295
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:12,280
and then he knew when the night
falls that the tiger would come out.

296
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,940
And then as soon as the bullets started
going crazy and running around the tree

297
00:08:15,941 --> 00:08:17,320
a lot because he knew he was scared.

298
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:18,560
My Dad was,

299
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,780
he had the shotgun with them,

300
00:08:19,781 --> 00:08:20,650
a three or a three.

301
00:08:20,651 --> 00:08:20,951
Oh wait,

302
00:08:20,951 --> 00:08:21,784
I think.

303
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:22,863
And uh,

304
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:27,640
and he had his flashlight and the minute
his flashlight touched the barrel of

305
00:08:27,641 --> 00:08:28,960
the gun,

306
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,910
it made a metal noise.

307
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,170
And then as soon as he did that,

308
00:08:32,171 --> 00:08:35,770
the tiger looked up at him and
instead of going for the ox,

309
00:08:35,771 --> 00:08:37,810
leaped straight at my dad and the tree.

310
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:38,651
Oh my God.

311
00:08:38,651 --> 00:08:42,100
My Dad just fumbled and shot and
hit him right here in the throat.

312
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:43,670
Oh my God.

313
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:44,530
Flipped back.

314
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:45,963
And then he,

315
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:49,930
he flashed the flashlight on his eyes to
see if they were so glossy and then he

316
00:08:49,931 --> 00:08:51,550
put another shot and just for safety.

317
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:57,310
And we have that skin to the holy shit.

318
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:58,690
You're done with gangster.
