1
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:05,370
Did your room experience podcast
is brought to you by tank.

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:10,400
If you go to [inaudible] dot [inaudible]
dot com you will save 25 bucks off of

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,340
any of their high end
cell phones or service.

4
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:15,450
Um,

5
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:16,500
if you have not,

6
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:17,030
uh,

7
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:20,040
if you're not aware of what Ting is
we've talked about on this podcast,

8
00:00:20,041 --> 00:00:25,041
many times the only people that will
ever do commercials for are people whose

9
00:00:25,051 --> 00:00:27,060
companies make sense to us.

10
00:00:27,061 --> 00:00:31,470
People whose companies like if they have
like a good ethic to them or if they're

11
00:00:31,471 --> 00:00:32,910
selling something that's really cool.

12
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,340
That's the only people that were
interested in getting involved in.

13
00:00:35,341 --> 00:00:38,850
And we got involved with Ting because
they're what I would call a non evil

14
00:00:38,851 --> 00:00:39,360
company.

15
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,750
Their approach is you don't
need to have contracts,

16
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:48,020
just give people a decent service at
a reasonable rate and you're gonna,

17
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:49,081
you're gonna make money.

18
00:00:49,081 --> 00:00:49,500
You don't,

19
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,810
you don't have to make
more money and be a cunt.

20
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:53,760
And that's sort of the idea behind it.

21
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:55,740
You can quit anytime you want.

22
00:00:55,741 --> 00:00:57,120
It's on the sprint backbone.

23
00:00:57,121 --> 00:00:59,450
So it's a legitimate high end,

24
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:00,390
uh,

25
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:04,470
broadband service and the legitimate
high end cellular connection.

26
00:01:04,471 --> 00:01:05,820
So it's not like it's,

27
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:06,391
you know,

28
00:01:06,391 --> 00:01:08,970
Bob cell phone companies
making his own wires.

29
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:09,990
They use sprint.

30
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:13,230
So what you're getting is all of the,

31
00:01:13,231 --> 00:01:13,591
the,

32
00:01:13,591 --> 00:01:13,831
the,

33
00:01:13,831 --> 00:01:15,690
the power of a big network,

34
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:16,751
but with all,

35
00:01:16,751 --> 00:01:17,790
and not all the bullshit.

36
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:21,210
You can have a couple people on the
same account and share minutes if your

37
00:01:21,211 --> 00:01:21,930
minutes,

38
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:23,370
if you don't use your minutes,

39
00:01:23,371 --> 00:01:25,290
you get credited and your next account,

40
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:27,840
no one is trying to fuck
you over at this company.

41
00:01:27,841 --> 00:01:30,690
And that's what we like
about them and that's why,

42
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:30,900
uh,

43
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:31,860
we represent them.

44
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:36,030
So go to rogan.ting.com
and save yourself 25 bucks.

45
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:38,520
We'll also brought to
you by brought to you.

46
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:39,540
Well,

47
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:42,930
we're also brought to you by
blade slinger from kerosene games.

48
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:43,620
Uh,

49
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:46,230
if you've never played
any games on the IPAD,

50
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:50,100
one of the things that can be really
annoying is if a game is not designed for

51
00:01:50,101 --> 00:01:50,791
the IPAD,

52
00:01:50,791 --> 00:01:52,590
if it's like poured it
over for a computer,

53
00:01:52,591 --> 00:01:54,540
then it's like the
controls are all fucked.

54
00:01:54,541 --> 00:01:54,691
You know,

55
00:01:54,691 --> 00:01:55,261
they're clunky.

56
00:01:55,261 --> 00:01:55,920
Yeah.

57
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,250
Yeah.

58
00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:00,100
This is designed specifically
for IPADS and iPhones.

59
00:02:00,101 --> 00:02:03,620
And one of the cool things about
living in today's era is that you,

60
00:02:03,621 --> 00:02:07,920
you get amazing visual processing
power from these little tablets,

61
00:02:07,921 --> 00:02:11,820
like something that would be a
giant computer just a few years ago,

62
00:02:11,821 --> 00:02:16,821
just 10 years ago is now a little thin
glass and metal piece of awesomeness.

63
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,320
And you can play this game on it and it's,

64
00:02:19,321 --> 00:02:19,651
you know,

65
00:02:19,651 --> 00:02:21,930
really high resolution graphics.

66
00:02:21,931 --> 00:02:26,931
It's a super cool game and it's only two
99 and you can get it on iTunes and it

67
00:02:27,961 --> 00:02:31,170
will be available very soon
for high end android devices.

68
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:32,280
They're shooting for February,

69
00:02:32,281 --> 00:02:33,114
I believe.

70
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:34,290
But it's a very cool game.

71
00:02:34,291 --> 00:02:37,080
If you go and look at the reviews online,

72
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,610
it's amazingly positive,

73
00:02:38,611 --> 00:02:41,460
which is incredible because the
universe is filled with clients.

74
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,280
So if you can get that
many positive reviews,

75
00:02:44,281 --> 00:02:46,710
you know that someone's doing
something right because,

76
00:02:46,711 --> 00:02:47,040
uh,

77
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:47,341
it's,

78
00:02:47,341 --> 00:02:48,300
it's a fun game to play.

79
00:02:48,301 --> 00:02:49,134
It's very addictive.

80
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:50,400
So it's called Blade slinger.

81
00:02:50,401 --> 00:02:52,170
It's on kerosene games
and it's three bucks.

82
00:02:52,171 --> 00:02:52,830
You fucks.

83
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:53,460
All right.

84
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:54,293
Get it together.

85
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:54,571
All right.

86
00:02:54,571 --> 00:02:57,750
We're also brought to you by [inaudible]
dot com I was going to bring in,

87
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:58,380
uh,

88
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:00,130
a gift pack for our buddy.

89
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:00,760
I'm here,

90
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,980
Alex Honnold but uh,

91
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:04,540
but I forgot it unfortunately.

92
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,231
But on it,

93
00:03:05,231 --> 00:03:06,490
if you're interested,

94
00:03:06,491 --> 00:03:07,540
we'll send you a bunch of shit.

95
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:09,130
It's a supplement company that,

96
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:09,431
uh,

97
00:03:09,431 --> 00:03:10,570
I'm a part of a,

98
00:03:10,571 --> 00:03:11,560
I own a piece of it.

99
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:16,480
And the reason why I got involved with
it was exactly what I said earlier about

100
00:03:16,481 --> 00:03:17,314
commercials.

101
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,490
The idea of selling something
to someone where you know,

102
00:03:21,491 --> 00:03:24,820
it's not a rip off the idea
of like a reasonable exchange.

103
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:28,000
Instead of having the ethics of business
that a lot of people have where you're

104
00:03:28,001 --> 00:03:32,170
just trying to squeeze
every last ounce of profit,

105
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:37,330
our idea is to sell the best shit
we can find as cheaply as we can.

106
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:42,800
We will sell you all of the cool food
items that I've gotten into that we've

107
00:03:43,691 --> 00:03:44,710
talked about on the podcast,

108
00:03:44,711 --> 00:03:46,120
including bulletproof coffee,

109
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:47,800
which I'm treating right now.

110
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:48,490
Um,

111
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:52,240
that's why sometimes like that's one
of the side effects of bulletproof

112
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:52,601
coffee.

113
00:03:52,601 --> 00:03:54,210
The fact that the butternut goobers

114
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:54,471
yeah,

115
00:03:54,471 --> 00:03:56,630
I got goobers I get a
little bit cotton mouth too,

116
00:03:56,631 --> 00:03:57,464
if you know what I'm saying.

117
00:03:57,650 --> 00:03:58,820
This bulletproof coffee,

118
00:03:58,821 --> 00:03:59,840
if you're not aware,

119
00:03:59,841 --> 00:04:02,840
and this is a fascinating thing
that I've just become aware of,

120
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:07,100
there's a real issue with foods
with something called mycotoxins.

121
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,870
Mycotoxins are,

122
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:12,200
is when you get coffee and uh,

123
00:04:12,201 --> 00:04:12,591
you know,

124
00:04:12,591 --> 00:04:16,400
and you don't know how it was taken
care of or it's even in corn number and

125
00:04:16,401 --> 00:04:17,234
reading.

126
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:21,980
What happens is if it's stored incorrectly
or harvested under certain conditions

127
00:04:21,981 --> 00:04:26,510
that can develop fungus and that fungus
can actually be toxic for your body.

128
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:28,520
So if you're drinking coffee like,

129
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:30,260
oh I feel like shit me,

130
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:32,480
you might have just poisoned herself.

131
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:35,710
And right now at this list just Starbucks,

132
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:37,690
Dave Asprey is actually doing research,

133
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:37,961
John,

134
00:04:37,961 --> 00:04:42,490
all this stuff to try to find
out exactly what the effects are,

135
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:43,540
how prevalent they are.

136
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:45,250
But they have absolutely been measured.

137
00:04:45,251 --> 00:04:46,001
This is a fact.

138
00:04:46,001 --> 00:04:51,001
There's a show called dangerous
grounds where a guy is a coffee expert.

139
00:04:51,401 --> 00:04:54,250
He goes to all these different really
exotic parts of the world where they

140
00:04:54,251 --> 00:04:55,150
cultivate coffee.

141
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:56,380
Cause a lot of the coffee that you buy,

142
00:04:56,381 --> 00:04:58,420
like my favorite stuff comes from Hawaii,

143
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:02,330
but a lot of coffee comes from like
really fucking freaky places I guess.

144
00:05:02,331 --> 00:05:02,400
Yes,

145
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:02,490
it

146
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:03,030
grows better.

147
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:06,210
This you get to the bottom of this because
I live right next door to a Starbucks

148
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:07,950
like every single day I go there,

149
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:09,330
everybody knows you at.

150
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:12,270
When do we would have to do as
far as test test their coffee.

151
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:15,030
You could test my fucking
ball sweat and it's,

152
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:18,240
I mean it's probably off your ball.

153
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,140
That would be the,

154
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:22,620
you are the most unscientific person ever
because who knows what kind of toxins

155
00:05:22,621 --> 00:05:23,580
are going into your body.

156
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:27,320
It's not like your buddies up purity
filter springwater comes out of it isn't

157
00:05:27,321 --> 00:05:31,590
that way by getting rid of the toxins
you to find out if you're getting it from

158
00:05:31,591 --> 00:05:32,570
Starbucks because we wouldn't,

159
00:05:32,571 --> 00:05:35,910
we'd have to only feed you Starbucks
for that scientific project to work.

160
00:05:35,911 --> 00:05:36,031
Well,

161
00:05:36,031 --> 00:05:40,170
I don't eat or do anything except a Trenta
Starbucks for the first six hours I'm

162
00:05:40,171 --> 00:05:40,800
awake.

163
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,760
We'll do you shit.

164
00:05:41,761 --> 00:05:43,890
You've eaten the last couple
of weeks could turn up in your,

165
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:44,813
in your system.

166
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,140
That's why people fail.

167
00:05:46,141 --> 00:05:46,681
Drug tests,

168
00:05:46,681 --> 00:05:47,460
dummy.

169
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:48,293
Okay.

170
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:48,740
Um,

171
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:48,930
the,

172
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:50,010
the point being,

173
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,510
there's a big difference between coffee
that has been cultivated from a single

174
00:05:54,511 --> 00:05:56,130
source and process.

175
00:05:56,131 --> 00:05:58,100
The way this stuff's process
and we sell it cheaper

176
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:58,940
than he does.

177
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:01,310
If I'm getting poisoned by
Starbucks this whole time,

178
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:02,360
I really think people are,

179
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,380
I really do because I,

180
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:06,860
I drank some Starbucks this weekend
and I'm not talking shit on Starbucks.

181
00:06:06,861 --> 00:06:07,611
I like Starbucks.

182
00:06:07,611 --> 00:06:08,450
I drink it all the time.

183
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:09,330
Um,

184
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:09,560
I,

185
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,010
it doesn't,

186
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:10,970
it doesn't taste as good.

187
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,020
It doesn't feel as good.

188
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:13,670
My body feels different when I drink it.

189
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:14,450
I think I,

190
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:15,830
I think it's not their fault.

191
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:18,170
I think it's something that
people are just not that aware of.

192
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,850
And I think people have to be aware of it.

193
00:06:19,851 --> 00:06:20,091
Now,

194
00:06:20,091 --> 00:06:24,200
this is a legitimate issue with things
that you can't see that are on your food

195
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,490
that can really fuck you up.

196
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:26,100
You know?

197
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:26,331
I mean,

198
00:06:26,331 --> 00:06:26,461
we,

199
00:06:26,461 --> 00:06:27,950
we know there's poisons out there.

200
00:06:27,951 --> 00:06:29,330
We know there's poison mushrooms.

201
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:29,991
I don't know why.

202
00:06:29,991 --> 00:06:34,610
It's just surprise people that some
fungus that grows on some food is really

203
00:06:34,611 --> 00:06:35,600
fucking shitty for you.

204
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:37,340
This is the tower seven of coffee.

205
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:38,213
It's not,

206
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:40,820
there's a lot of science
on mycotoxins says no,

207
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:41,900
it's no tower seven.

208
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:42,950
It's a fact.

209
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:45,530
If you go and look at mycotoxins on corn,

210
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:46,760
it's really kind of creepy.

211
00:06:46,761 --> 00:06:47,240
Men.

212
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,160
Corn is fucking terrible for you,

213
00:06:49,161 --> 00:06:49,660
man.

214
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:52,880
Well that means we're all poison
like corn syrup and all that shit.

215
00:06:52,881 --> 00:06:55,490
You're probably getting a
little bit a negligible,

216
00:06:55,491 --> 00:06:57,980
a little bit of a toxins
with that shit as well.

217
00:06:59,240 --> 00:06:59,870
Jesus.

218
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:00,230
Yeah.

219
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:01,340
Well you can just Google it.

220
00:07:01,341 --> 00:07:02,121
It's really interesting.

221
00:07:02,121 --> 00:07:02,870
I might be wrong.

222
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:03,980
They might be blown with the science.

223
00:07:03,981 --> 00:07:04,814
Might be all horseshit.

224
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,950
They might've made it up just to,

225
00:07:05,951 --> 00:07:08,780
to go after the corn industry
because someone fucks someone's wife.

226
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:12,470
Fritos and Starbucks in up Lynn Tech.

227
00:07:12,471 --> 00:07:13,430
But I do know,

228
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:13,670
yeah,

229
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:17,930
you can do that if you're really
down Fredo shake something.

230
00:07:17,931 --> 00:07:20,840
We carry Blendtec blender is a perfect
example of something we just started

231
00:07:20,841 --> 00:07:22,730
carrying because it's just awesome.

232
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,600
It's a good thing to have.

233
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:23,930
You know,

234
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:24,121
we,

235
00:07:24,121 --> 00:07:25,250
we sell fitness equipment,

236
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:26,103
kettlebells,

237
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:27,410
battle ropes,

238
00:07:27,411 --> 00:07:30,860
and there's an awesome extreme kettlebell
DVD video that we sell as well.

239
00:07:30,861 --> 00:07:30,980
If,

240
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:31,221
you know,

241
00:07:31,221 --> 00:07:33,980
if you an introduction to a high end,

242
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:34,850
um,

243
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:35,510
uh,

244
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:35,871
these,

245
00:07:35,871 --> 00:07:36,350
um,

246
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:39,860
these crazy workouts people are putting
together like this one that we have from

247
00:07:39,861 --> 00:07:40,500
Keith Weber,

248
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:40,661
it's,

249
00:07:40,661 --> 00:07:41,690
it's really amazing.

250
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:43,070
It's a great workout.

251
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:44,360
It's about,

252
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:44,960
I think,

253
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:45,920
I mean I get,

254
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:47,810
I can't get through 45 minutes of it,

255
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:50,030
especially with a 50 pound kettle bell.

256
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:51,320
It will make you puke.

257
00:07:51,321 --> 00:07:51,891
It's amazing.

258
00:07:51,891 --> 00:07:53,500
It's a fantastic workout.

259
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:57,200
It's one of the best things to have where
all you have to do is just press play

260
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:58,580
and follow along with it.

261
00:07:58,581 --> 00:08:00,740
Just go and we can't keep
these things in stock.

262
00:08:00,741 --> 00:08:02,600
They're selling like crazy
for that very reason.

263
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:04,010
So it makes you puke.

264
00:08:04,011 --> 00:08:07,190
So it's a way to work out and then
throw up sort of becoming baleen mic and

265
00:08:07,191 --> 00:08:08,120
that's how you're getting fit.

266
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:08,421
Yeah.

267
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:09,320
You're getting Finn,

268
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:10,520
you growing up,

269
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:11,900
if you ever,

270
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:12,920
you've never worked out so hard.

271
00:08:12,921 --> 00:08:13,440
You thrown out.

272
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,273
Never.

273
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:15,110
That sounds awful.

274
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:18,610
You've got to put any
time son sex go to on it.

275
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:18,990
Yeah,

276
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:20,210
he'll throw up after puke.

277
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:20,570
No,

278
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:22,130
I feel like puking sometimes after sex.

279
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,020
I bet you do because you can't
believe somebody fucked you.

280
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:24,771
I bet you just,

281
00:08:24,771 --> 00:08:26,450
you just get in the bathroom
and you separate yourself.

282
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:30,620
It's more of like a heart
attack thing on it.com o n n.

283
00:08:30,621 --> 00:08:35,150
I t use the code name Rogan and save
10% off any and all supplements.

285

got a bunch of new crazy shit.

286

bee honey Himalayan salts.

287
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,290
I don't know if any that
stuff's really good for you,

288
00:08:43,291 --> 00:08:44,270
but sounds bad ass.

289
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:44,641
All right,

290
00:08:44,641 --> 00:08:45,474
you fucks.

291
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:47,360
Alex Honnold is here.

292
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:51,230
We're going to talk to this
young man about some crazy shit.

293
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:51,891
All right,

294
00:08:51,891 --> 00:08:54,710

Alex Honnold.

298
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:04,763
Greetings.

299
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:06,300
Hello.

300
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:10,480
Very nice to meet you in person and a
very nice to have you here on the show and

301
00:09:10,481 --> 00:09:14,550
I'm super psyched that you decided to
come and join us because I watched one of

302
00:09:14,551 --> 00:09:15,061
your videos,

303
00:09:15,061 --> 00:09:18,480
I've seen several of them on the line
for folks who don't know Alex is what you

304
00:09:18,481 --> 00:09:19,860
call a free solo climber.

305
00:09:19,861 --> 00:09:20,700
Is that how you would describe it?

306
00:09:20,701 --> 00:09:20,821
Yeah,

307
00:09:20,821 --> 00:09:21,654
you could say that.

308
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:22,170
Um,

309
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:22,530
uh,

310
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:27,530
and he essentially climbs gigantic
scary mountains with no aid.

311
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:28,390
You,

312
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:29,370
you don't have ropes,

313
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,440
you just climate with
your hands and your feet.

314
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,460
And I mean occasionally,

315
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:33,773
occasionally,

316
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:35,960
well you in that car with ropes,

317
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:37,120
that's just special occasions,

318
00:09:37,121 --> 00:09:37,320
you know,

319
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,520
but you do it a lot.

320
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:40,590
I mean there's a lot of
videos of you doing this.

321
00:09:40,591 --> 00:09:42,600
You say an occasionally for
the average human being,

322
00:09:42,601 --> 00:09:43,460
if they did something like that,

323
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,550
they would sit around the campfire
kids grandpa's I tell you about how he

324
00:09:47,551 --> 00:09:51,000
climbed a mountain with his bare hands
and everybody would go on and on about

325
00:09:51,001 --> 00:09:51,091
it.

326
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:53,310
Like it was a once in
a lifetime and insane,

327
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:54,300
you know,

328
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,830
death defying event.

329
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,180
How many times have you done it?

330
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:58,211
Well,

331
00:09:58,211 --> 00:09:59,860
how many times did I
say three solo climbed?

332
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:00,251
Oh,

333
00:10:00,251 --> 00:10:01,084
I mean,

334
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,080
it depends on how hard,

335
00:10:02,081 --> 00:10:02,531
you know what I mean?

336
00:10:02,531 --> 00:10:03,231
A free soul,

337
00:10:03,231 --> 00:10:04,150
easy routes all the time.

338
00:10:04,151 --> 00:10:04,984
But,

339
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:05,681
but you know,

340
00:10:05,681 --> 00:10:07,240
the big hard ones that
you've seen videos of,

341
00:10:07,241 --> 00:10:07,451
I mean,

342
00:10:07,451 --> 00:10:08,560
that's a little more infrequent.

343
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:11,020
Have you ever had a close call?

344
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:12,551
Oh,

345
00:10:12,551 --> 00:10:13,800
it all depends what you call it.

346
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:14,351
Close Call,

347
00:10:14,351 --> 00:10:15,120
you know?

348
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:15,370
Um,

349
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:15,611
but no,

350
00:10:15,611 --> 00:10:17,560
I haven't had any like
serious accidents or anything.

351
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:17,831
Well,

352
00:10:17,831 --> 00:10:19,390
have you ever had a
moment where you're like,

353
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,890
oh shit like this,

354
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:22,930
this could be a problem?

355
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:24,580
Um,

356
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:26,380
well I mean certainly some
moments where you're like,

357
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:26,860
oh,

358
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,060
this could become a problem.

359
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:28,900
Um,

360
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:29,680
but never,

361
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,161
never like,

362
00:10:30,161 --> 00:10:30,341
oh,

363
00:10:30,341 --> 00:10:32,260
it's all going downhill and
it's about to come apart.

364
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,360
But have you ever gotten to a point,

365
00:10:34,361 --> 00:10:34,630
I mean,

366
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:39,630
I assume your process is you first
climate with ropes to find out where your

367
00:10:39,901 --> 00:10:40,734
route would be?

368
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:41,371
Yeah,

369
00:10:41,371 --> 00:10:42,270
just generally.

370
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:43,220
Um,

371
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:43,541
I should,

372
00:10:43,541 --> 00:10:43,831
do you know,

373
00:10:43,831 --> 00:10:44,551
anything more climate?

374
00:10:44,551 --> 00:10:45,160
Have you climbed in it?

375
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:45,430
No,

376
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:45,861
never climbed.

377
00:10:45,861 --> 00:10:46,480
Okay.

378
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,313
Um,

379
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:48,780
because like within climbing,

380
00:10:48,781 --> 00:10:48,991
you know,

381
00:10:48,991 --> 00:10:50,130
there's more of a context for it.

382
00:10:50,131 --> 00:10:50,640
But,

383
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,420
um,

384
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:51,781
the thing is,

385
00:10:51,781 --> 00:10:53,730
I mean generally there's
already a root established.

386
00:10:53,731 --> 00:10:54,690
You have like a little Topo,

387
00:10:54,691 --> 00:10:56,070
you have a map that tells
you where your spot.

388
00:10:56,071 --> 00:10:57,810
So people have already
done before you yeah.

389
00:10:57,811 --> 00:10:57,991
On,

390
00:10:57,991 --> 00:10:58,710
on all the,

391
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:00,630
on for the most part,

392
00:11:00,631 --> 00:11:03,450
the things that I've sold it or like
established routes that people have done

393
00:11:03,451 --> 00:11:03,930
before.

394
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:05,610
And for the most part
I've done them before too.

395
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,760
So I already kind of know this series
of movements that you had to go through

396
00:11:08,761 --> 00:11:09,300
them once.

397
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,560
So the first time you went through it,

398
00:11:10,561 --> 00:11:12,600
you follow a map of people
who've already been there.

399
00:11:12,601 --> 00:11:12,780
Yeah,

400
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:13,490
generally.

401
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:13,981
Um,

402
00:11:13,981 --> 00:11:14,814
I mean I have,

403
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,390
it's called onsite when you do something
without ever having done it before.

404
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:20,430
So I have like onsite solid,

405
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:21,900
big new routes before,

406
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:22,151
dude,

407
00:11:22,151 --> 00:11:22,360
like,

408
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,480
just get sweaty talking to you.

409
00:11:23,481 --> 00:11:24,870
I just want to tell
you right now for real,

410
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:27,030
my hands getting sweaty when
I'm thinking about this.

411
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:27,690
Um,

412
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:28,081
this,

413
00:11:28,081 --> 00:11:32,780
we're watching a video right now if you
on 60 minutes and that was a established

414
00:11:32,781 --> 00:11:36,210
route that you were climbing so that
that route was put up in the 60s I think.

415
00:11:36,211 --> 00:11:38,550
Or maybe the 70s they start
doing this in the 60s.

416
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:38,910
Yeah.

417
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:40,110
But so when they establish it,

418
00:11:40,111 --> 00:11:42,870
they use p tons and hammers and they're
like well their way up the mountain,

419
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:43,471
you know,

420
00:11:43,471 --> 00:11:45,000
because that was kind
of the style of the day.

421
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:48,330
I think they did over multiple days and
then in the 70s it got done in a day for

422
00:11:48,331 --> 00:11:50,520
the first time and then
you know what I mean?

423
00:11:50,521 --> 00:11:52,350
It's just kind of the
gradual progression of style.

424
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:58,200
So climbing as a sport has
been around for a long time.

425
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:00,760
We'll coming as a sport is
like rooted back to albinism.

426
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:03,760
People like climbing in the Alps
and the 18 hundreds and all that.

427
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,590
I mean people are boys climbed a mountain.

428
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:07,660
I mean look at all the monks
and stuff in the Himalaya.

429
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:10,090
What attracted you to this?

430
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:11,250
I Dunno,

431
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:12,310
I just like climbing on things.

432
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:13,443
Why do you think

433
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:16,030
this has been since you were,

434
00:12:16,031 --> 00:12:16,540
how old?

435
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:17,373
How old are you now?

436
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,610
I'm 27 now.

437
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:20,290
I've been climbing all the time,

438
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:21,790
like in the gym and stuff since I was 10.

439
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:22,810
I think it just,

440
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:23,380
it just,

441
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:24,310
it was attractive to you?

442
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:24,761
Yeah,

443
00:12:24,761 --> 00:12:25,001
just,

444
00:12:25,001 --> 00:12:25,211
I mean,

445
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:26,360
as a kid I love commentaries.

446
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,430
I love climbing buildings.

447
00:12:27,431 --> 00:12:28,420
I'd like play on stuff,

448
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:28,631
you know,

449
00:12:28,631 --> 00:12:29,270
climb the roof,

450
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:30,103
whatever.

451
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:30,970
Um,

452
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:31,331
and then,

453
00:12:31,331 --> 00:12:31,600
uh,

454
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,360
my parents read about
this gym opening and sack,

455
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:34,203
like climbing gym.

456
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,680
So I went and started climbing inside.

457
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:37,690
What do your parents think about this?

458
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:40,030
While I was like surprisingly supportive,

459
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:41,053
you know what I mean?

460
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:41,261
Yeah.

461
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:41,441
I mean,

462
00:12:41,441 --> 00:12:44,740
well I mean she just kind of trusts me
to do what I like to do and do it well

463
00:12:44,741 --> 00:12:45,370
and you know,

464
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:46,480
make good decisions or whatever.

465
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:47,350
Yeah,

466
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:48,420
making good decisions.

467
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:50,170
That's a huge understatement.

468
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:50,990
It's one thing,

469
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:51,400
say,

470
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,040
you know,

471
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:52,370
sign.

472
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:53,860
If you want to get into
the insurance business,

473
00:12:53,861 --> 00:12:55,120
you've got to make good decisions.

474
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:57,610
That's one thing.

475
00:12:57,870 --> 00:13:01,510
Is anybody like in any course in
life has to like make good decisions?

476
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:01,980
Yes.

477
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:02,621
You are correct.

478
00:13:02,621 --> 00:13:02,831
I mean,

479
00:13:02,831 --> 00:13:04,660
cause if I was going out partying every,

480
00:13:04,661 --> 00:13:05,494
every weekend,

481
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:05,951
you know,

482
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:08,320
I'd probably have almost
as high of a risk of death,

483
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:08,711
you know,

484
00:13:08,711 --> 00:13:11,230
like driving drunk and all that
kind of stuff is what I'm doing.

485
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,150
You'll probably right.

486
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:12,371
I mean,

487
00:13:12,371 --> 00:13:12,761
so it's like,

488
00:13:12,761 --> 00:13:15,450
it's all just how you view
risk and reward rewarding.

489
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,541
It certainly is,

490
00:13:16,541 --> 00:13:16,931
but that,

491
00:13:16,931 --> 00:13:17,201
I mean,

492
00:13:17,201 --> 00:13:19,690
that really is an understatement when
you're saying make them good decisions.

493
00:13:19,691 --> 00:13:21,490
You climbing up these things,

494
00:13:21,491 --> 00:13:22,360
like what is the tallest thing?

495
00:13:22,361 --> 00:13:24,580
You've climbed a like 3000 feet minutes.

496
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:29,591
Well,

497
00:13:29,591 --> 00:13:29,831
yeah,

498
00:13:29,831 --> 00:13:33,430
but the difference between 3075 it
doesn't make that big difference as far as

499
00:13:33,431 --> 00:13:33,940
death.

500
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:34,773
Yeah.

501
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,490
60 you're pretty much hosed.

502
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,600
But doesn't it feel like a
freak out when you're up?

503
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:40,541
To me,

504
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:41,410
the appeal is the,

505
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:42,610
is the bigness.

506
00:13:42,611 --> 00:13:42,881
You know,

507
00:13:42,881 --> 00:13:44,290
like I look at a huge face and I'm like,

508
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:45,250
that looks Rad.

509
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:45,731
You know,

510
00:13:45,731 --> 00:13:46,930
if I look at it 60 foot face,

511
00:13:46,931 --> 00:13:47,381
I'm kind of like,

512
00:13:47,381 --> 00:13:47,651
no,

513
00:13:47,651 --> 00:13:47,921
you know,

514
00:13:47,921 --> 00:13:48,754
that looks okay.

515
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,310
But when you see a really huge,

516
00:13:51,311 --> 00:13:52,270
impressive while you're like,

517
00:13:52,271 --> 00:13:53,200
that's inspiring.

518
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:53,441
You know?

519
00:13:53,441 --> 00:13:54,300
That's what I get psyched about.

520
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:54,820
Um,

521
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,680
do you like people watching you do this?

522
00:13:57,090 --> 00:13:57,310
Uh,

523
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:58,143
not particularly.

524
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:02,770
And I've done very little soling
that's actually like live and watched,

525
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:03,431
you know.

526
00:14:03,431 --> 00:14:05,620
So most of the videos that
you've seen and stuff for um,

527
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:06,400
you know,

528
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,150
repeated afterwards.

529
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:10,270
Well actually it's funny cause the one
that you're queuing right now is well so

530
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:11,123
semi live.

531
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,393
Um,

532
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:13,460
and the 60 minutes thing,

533
00:14:13,461 --> 00:14:15,880
it was live cause they're like
a legitimate news organization.

534
00:14:15,881 --> 00:14:16,960
They had to shoot the real thing.

535
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:17,320
Right.

536
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:20,650
Did it weird for you to
have people filming you?

537
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:24,370
That's the thing is that generally
when I film on projects like that,

538
00:14:24,371 --> 00:14:25,204
um,

539
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:26,170
I do things that are like,

540
00:14:26,171 --> 00:14:28,780
well within my abilities kind of
comfortable and easy and whatever.

541
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:29,800
So the 60 minutes thing,

542
00:14:29,801 --> 00:14:31,270
even though it looks awesome
and it's really cool,

543
00:14:31,271 --> 00:14:33,520
that's actually kind of like a
moderate route and it's not like,

544
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:33,970
you know,

545
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:35,740
it's not breaking new
ground for rock climbing.

546
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:37,480
I mean it never been sold before and it's,

547
00:14:37,481 --> 00:14:38,410
and it's pretty hard,

548
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:42,160
but mostly I just chose something
that was aesthetic and like cool.

549
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:42,431
You know,

550
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:46,210
it was like good enough but
it's never been sold before.

551
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:46,721
Like,

552
00:14:46,721 --> 00:14:47,240
that's the,

553
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,600
that's quite as well,

554
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,990
there aren't that many
people have that solar,

555
00:14:49,991 --> 00:14:50,290
you know,

556
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:51,590
you're like not that
many folks are into it.

557
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:52,790
So you kind of have your pick of the,

558
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:53,661
pick the letter,

559
00:14:53,661 --> 00:14:53,930
you know.

560
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:55,580
Well if there are that many folks into it,

561
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:57,500
how many of them aren't around anymore?

562
00:14:58,550 --> 00:14:59,030
Well,

563
00:14:59,030 --> 00:14:59,241
yeah,

564
00:14:59,241 --> 00:15:00,140
it depends how you count.

565
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:02,703
Well,

566
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:04,370
what does this mean?

567
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:08,570
I can only think of one really
high end Solos to actually died.

568
00:15:08,571 --> 00:15:09,620
So line really?

569
00:15:09,621 --> 00:15:09,991
I think.

570
00:15:09,991 --> 00:15:10,310
Yeah.

571
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:11,143
Only one.

572
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,193
Yeah.

573
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:13,160
Uh,

574
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,840
who was he a John Packer?

575
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:16,010
He was actually kind of like a,

576
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:16,730
you know,

577
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:17,670
childhood inspiration.

578
00:15:17,671 --> 00:15:18,830
Like you spell his last name a,

579
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:20,060
B.

580
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:20,060
A.

581
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:20,060
C.

582
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:20,060
H.

583
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:20,060
A.

584
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:20,750
R.

585
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:21,583
Okay.

586
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:22,481
He,

587
00:15:22,481 --> 00:15:22,670
uh,

588
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:24,140
he fell solely on things.

589
00:15:24,141 --> 00:15:24,921
He was kind of older.

590
00:15:24,921 --> 00:15:25,101
I mean,

591
00:15:25,101 --> 00:15:26,870
he was maybe 50 or something and,

592
00:15:26,871 --> 00:15:27,080
um,

593
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,440
he'd had a car accident and had
some like nerve damage and like,

594
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:29,751
you know,

595
00:15:29,751 --> 00:15:30,950
who knows what actually happened?

596
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:31,101
Oh,

597
00:15:31,101 --> 00:15:31,570
Jesus.

598
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:32,210
He,

599
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:33,080
maybe he broke a hole.

600
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:33,860
Maybe he just,

601
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:34,670
I don't know.

602
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:35,001
But like,

603
00:15:35,001 --> 00:15:35,391
he'd had,

604
00:15:35,391 --> 00:15:35,631
you know,

605
00:15:35,631 --> 00:15:38,300
like back issues and things going
on because you'd had this like,

606
00:15:38,301 --> 00:15:39,170
horrible car accident.

607
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:39,820
Oh Wow.

608
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:40,240
So on,

609
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,200
it's one of those things where
it's not like a clear cut,

610
00:15:42,201 --> 00:15:43,034
like,

611
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:43,521
well I mean,

612
00:15:43,521 --> 00:15:43,701
yeah,

613
00:15:43,701 --> 00:15:44,511
I mean it is clear cut.

614
00:15:44,511 --> 00:15:45,680
He fell off the mountain and he died.

615
00:15:45,681 --> 00:15:46,550
But um,

616
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:47,450
so,

617
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:48,290
but you know,

618
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:49,280
you look at it cause he was,

619
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:53,000
he was by far the best of his generation
for like the eighties and early

620
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,710
nineties and actually
the 70s until the 90s,

621
00:15:54,711 --> 00:15:55,544
basically.

622
00:15:55,940 --> 00:16:00,200
Now when you see a guy and that's how
it ends for him and he's a free solo

623
00:16:00,201 --> 00:16:00,561
climber,

624
00:16:00,561 --> 00:16:01,700
do you look at that and say,

625
00:16:01,701 --> 00:16:02,061
you know,

626
00:16:02,061 --> 00:16:03,350
we know what everybody goes.

627
00:16:03,351 --> 00:16:03,531
I mean,

628
00:16:03,531 --> 00:16:04,850
that's kind of a cool way to do it.

629
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,490
Definitely not like that's
a cool way to do that.

630
00:16:07,491 --> 00:16:08,121
That's horrible.

631
00:16:08,121 --> 00:16:08,710
I mean,

632
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:09,021
I know,

633
00:16:09,021 --> 00:16:09,651
I mean honestly,

634
00:16:09,651 --> 00:16:12,830
he basically broke everything in his
body and he lay there for hours and died.

635
00:16:12,831 --> 00:16:13,251
You know what I mean?

636
00:16:13,251 --> 00:16:14,150
That's like a horrible,

637
00:16:14,151 --> 00:16:14,481
horrible,

638
00:16:14,481 --> 00:16:15,530
he didn't die instantly.

639
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:15,981
No,

640
00:16:15,981 --> 00:16:16,291
he,

641
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:16,701
he was,

642
00:16:16,701 --> 00:16:17,240
uh,

643
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,550
he was out at like a 60 foot
cliff by his house or whatever.

644
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,410
So he probably felt like 50 feet.

645
00:16:21,411 --> 00:16:24,410
He broke everything in his body and he
bled out or I don't know what happened.

646
00:16:24,411 --> 00:16:24,780
I mean,

647
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:25,940
it's like a horrible,

648
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:26,211
I mean,

649
00:16:26,211 --> 00:16:27,260
it's a horrible thing to happen,

650
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,050
but yeah,

651
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:30,770
I mean if you felt like 2000 feet,

652
00:16:30,771 --> 00:16:30,981
yeah,

653
00:16:30,981 --> 00:16:31,970
you would splat like,

654
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:33,890
you would just explode
like a bag of water.

655
00:16:33,891 --> 00:16:34,370
But like,

656
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:35,091
but from 50,

657
00:16:35,091 --> 00:16:36,320
it's like that's a pretty horrible,

658
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:36,891
yeah,

659
00:16:36,891 --> 00:16:38,630
that sounds like a terrible way to go.

660
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:38,931
Yeah.

661
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:40,580
I mean it totally sucks,

662
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:41,121
but I mean,

663
00:16:41,121 --> 00:16:41,954
the thing is,

664
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:42,771
you know,

665
00:16:42,771 --> 00:16:43,110
he,

666
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:45,640
he lived his whole life doing
that kind of thing and you know,

667
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:49,160
he'd obviously confronted those kinds
of issues in his life and you know,

668
00:16:49,161 --> 00:16:49,301
he,

669
00:16:49,301 --> 00:16:50,550
he made his choice and that's,

670
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:51,803
that's how it worked out,

671
00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:53,363
you know?

672
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:54,980
Wow.

673
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,120
How many people are doing it,

674
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:56,630
if you,

675
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:57,470
if you had to guess,

676
00:16:57,830 --> 00:16:58,400
is it a,

677
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:58,641
well,

678
00:16:58,641 --> 00:16:59,150
so that's,

679
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:02,000
earlier I said the difference between
high and so long and like recreational

680
00:17:02,001 --> 00:17:02,271
stuff.

681
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:03,760
So if you're counting recreational,

682
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:06,020
just going out and climbing fun
routes after work or whatever,

683
00:17:06,021 --> 00:17:07,610
they're tons of climbers that go Solon,

684
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:08,391
but,

685
00:17:08,391 --> 00:17:09,224
um,

686
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,071
high end style,

687
00:17:10,071 --> 00:17:11,330
like pushing it on hard,

688
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:11,990
you know,

689
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:12,321
hard,

690
00:17:12,321 --> 00:17:14,510
hard routes like the kind of videos
that you're watching where you're like,

691
00:17:14,511 --> 00:17:15,350
that looks insane.

692
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:16,483
Then there,

693
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:20,490
right now there's maybe a half dozen
dudes in the world that I think things

694
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:21,500
similar like that,

695
00:17:21,501 --> 00:17:21,950
you know,

696
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:26,950
but you are known as the one who
does the most ridiculous routes.

697
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,640
Even the one who's known
as the guy well in,

698
00:17:30,641 --> 00:17:32,300
in the u s right now anyway,

699
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:33,410
you know,

700
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:34,730
who else is doing this?

701
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:36,320
Where's this like popular?

702
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:40,040
There are a couple of dudes in Europe
who've done maybe not like at this moment

703
00:17:40,041 --> 00:17:41,330
there and doing anything crazy,

704
00:17:41,331 --> 00:17:42,020
but um,

705
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:44,120
that's certainly like recently
I've done really hard things.

706
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:45,520
Um,

707
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,353
you know,

708
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:46,941
I mean there's a,

709
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:48,560
there's a history of soloing
all around the world.

710
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:49,740
Wow.

711
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:49,981
It's,

712
00:17:49,981 --> 00:17:51,540
this is completely new to me.

713
00:17:51,541 --> 00:17:52,170
I mean,

714
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:53,610
I had seen like maybe,

715
00:17:53,611 --> 00:17:54,444
you know,

716
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:57,660
randomly gone across videos on the
Internet of Peter Climbing things,

717
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,830
but I really never seen anything where
people would put climbing without ropes.

718
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:03,780
So when I first saw you doing it,

719
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,510
there's a rich tradition of it,

720
00:18:06,511 --> 00:18:07,380
especially in California,

721
00:18:07,381 --> 00:18:08,460
actually in southern California.

722
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:09,360
Um,

723
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,420
all the best climbers in the country
in the 70s came from Soco and they were

724
00:18:12,421 --> 00:18:12,900
all,

725
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,040
they were called the stone masters.

726
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:14,640
And,

727
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:14,790
uh,

728
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:15,571
like Joshua tree,

729
00:18:15,571 --> 00:18:15,780
you know,

730
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:17,640
which is just local has a,

731
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:19,370
like a huge history of Solon.

732
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:20,191
You know what I mean?

733
00:18:20,191 --> 00:18:23,280
I grew up like hearing soling stories
and thinking it was cool and you know,

734
00:18:23,281 --> 00:18:23,850
whatever.

735
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:24,683
Wow.

736
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:24,901
Yeah.

737
00:18:24,901 --> 00:18:25,051
I mean,

738
00:18:25,051 --> 00:18:26,430
there's a total of like tradition of it,

739
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:29,100
but so do you make a living doing this?

740
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:30,210
I do now.

741
00:18:30,211 --> 00:18:30,391
Yeah.

742
00:18:30,391 --> 00:18:31,110
That's pretty,

743
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:31,590
pretty cool.

744
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:32,250
Wow.

745
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:33,240
And how did that happen?

746
00:18:33,241 --> 00:18:34,140
Do you have sponsors?

747
00:18:34,141 --> 00:18:34,281
Yeah,

748
00:18:34,281 --> 00:18:35,114
that's how sponsors,

749
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:35,960
um,

750
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:36,793
sorta picked him up,

751
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:37,021
you know,

752
00:18:37,021 --> 00:18:41,460
through the climbing community is I went
and the sponsors just give you money

753
00:18:41,461 --> 00:18:42,790
and they pay you every month and just,

754
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:43,800
you just go climbing.

755
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:44,320
Yeah.

756
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:44,850
Yup.

757
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:45,120
Yeah,

758
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:45,930
they're really awesome.

759
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:49,830
Are there competitions or do you just
go wherever you want to go and people

760
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:52,470
follow you and the publicity helps them?

761
00:18:52,471 --> 00:18:53,304
Is that how it works?

762
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:55,710
So there are competitions in climbing,

763
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:56,220
but um,

764
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:59,220
it's kind of like skiing or something
where it kind of subdivides into like

765
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:00,930
Olympic style competition scheme.

766
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:04,410
And then there's like big mountain type
dudes who make videos and just like go

767
00:19:04,411 --> 00:19:05,310
rage in Alaska.

768
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:08,190
So I'm kind of one of those like big
mountain type dudes that just goes and

769
00:19:08,191 --> 00:19:10,020
rages and makes videos and does whatever.

770
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,370
Like I don't do competitions.

771
00:19:11,371 --> 00:19:12,570
It's kind of like two different supports.

772
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:13,411
Yeah,

773
00:19:13,411 --> 00:19:14,880
you don't want to be rushed.

774
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:17,030
It doesn't seem like something
you would want to win.

775
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:17,541
How would you,

776
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:17,761
you know,

777
00:19:17,761 --> 00:19:18,720
who would I compete with?

778
00:19:18,721 --> 00:19:18,931
You know,

779
00:19:18,931 --> 00:19:20,790
like nobody else even likes
to do this kind of stuff,

780
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:21,270
right?

781
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:22,260
Like that.

782
00:19:22,261 --> 00:19:23,520
Doesn't that sound crazy though?

783
00:19:23,521 --> 00:19:26,520
You're still talking about 300 million
people in this country and this may be

784
00:19:26,521 --> 00:19:28,650
like five other dudes that
are doing what you're doing.

785
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:29,120
Well,

786
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,290
maybe five other than
the world and the world.

787
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:31,711
Okay.

788
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:32,251
And this country.

789
00:19:32,251 --> 00:19:33,084
You're the only guy?

790
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:33,450
No,

791
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:34,350
there's like another dude,

792
00:19:34,351 --> 00:19:35,161
he's a little older than me.

793
00:19:35,161 --> 00:19:35,311
Who,

794
00:19:35,311 --> 00:19:35,640
uh,

795
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,870
do you guys look at each other weird like,

796
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:37,141
yeah,

797
00:19:37,141 --> 00:19:37,974
man.

798
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,270
Definitely not facing.

799
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:42,320
Um,

800
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,070
now there are a handful of
dudes in the states and I mean,

801
00:19:44,071 --> 00:19:45,960
and things you never know
because so much is so long.

802
00:19:45,961 --> 00:19:50,961
It just has to do with like motivation
because the actual technical difficulty

803
00:19:51,871 --> 00:19:52,980
of the climbing isn't very high.

804
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:53,940
Like the thing that I did,

805
00:19:53,941 --> 00:19:56,720
I'm on 60 minutes is actually
like a pretty easy route.

806
00:19:56,721 --> 00:19:57,554
It's very moderate.

807
00:19:58,050 --> 00:19:58,560
Um,

808
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:01,350
I mean like a lot of climbers who have
only been climbing a few years could

809
00:20:01,351 --> 00:20:02,700
climb that difficulty level,

810
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:05,220
but they just would never
want to do it without a rope.

811
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:05,521
You know,

812
00:20:05,521 --> 00:20:06,600
they don't have that motivation.

813
00:20:06,601 --> 00:20:06,931
It'd be like,

814
00:20:06,931 --> 00:20:08,550
I want to climb it huge face with no,

815
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:09,330
no protection.

816
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:10,011
Now when you,

817
00:20:10,011 --> 00:20:10,350
you know,

818
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:12,250
you say that it's no big deal that you're,

819
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:16,380
you were the first person of free
solo something that is a big deal.

820
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:16,741
I mean,

821
00:20:16,741 --> 00:20:17,850
you're just being humble.

822
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:18,780
Okay.

823
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:19,200
You are,

824
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:19,921
you're being humble.

825
00:20:19,921 --> 00:20:20,754
You're crazy.

826
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:21,460
Listen to me.

827
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:21,940
Come on.

828
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:23,420
I'm older now.

829
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,710
I'm not saying you didn't
see him for doing that.

830
00:20:25,711 --> 00:20:26,370
I'm saying,

831
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:26,761
you know,

832
00:20:26,761 --> 00:20:27,031
your,

833
00:20:27,031 --> 00:20:27,600
your,

834
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,240
your point of view is
very self deprecating,

835
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:30,871
you know,

836
00:20:30,871 --> 00:20:35,520
so you're your idea that that's not crazy
to be the first person to climb up it

837
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:38,600
in the known human race ropes.

838
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:38,871
Yeah.

839
00:20:38,871 --> 00:20:39,360
Okay.

840
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,800
It's kind of fucking crazy kid,

841
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:43,620
but it seems more normal
when you do it all the time,

842
00:20:43,621 --> 00:20:43,950
you know,

843
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:44,730
I'm sure.

844
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:46,650
But I'm just saying to a person like,

845
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:47,610
like me.

846
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:47,890
Yeah.

847
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:48,410
Um,

848
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:48,620
it's,

849
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:49,630
it's pretty impressive.

850
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:54,460
When you do you go up
something with ropes and say,

851
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:55,090
you know what,

852
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:56,380
I see enough spots.

853
00:20:56,530 --> 00:20:57,970
Do you map it out in your head?

854
00:20:58,580 --> 00:20:59,170
For sure.

855
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:00,700
So like for the 60 minutes when,

856
00:21:00,701 --> 00:21:01,271
for example,

857
00:21:01,271 --> 00:21:04,930
I'd climbed it a month before just to
like see if it was reasonable and I was

858
00:21:04,931 --> 00:21:05,051
like,

859
00:21:05,051 --> 00:21:05,291
okay,

860
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:06,310
I could definitely do this.

861
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:10,600
And then maybe 10 days before I climbed
it again with more like intention and

862
00:21:10,601 --> 00:21:11,170
uh,

863
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:14,530
there are basically two hard parts on
it and the rest is sort of like filler,

864
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:15,011
you know,

865
00:21:15,011 --> 00:21:15,880
like moderate climate,

866
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:19,010
like the type that I could easily
do first try whatever without no,

867
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:21,850
when you say hard parts
and you get to a place,

868
00:21:21,851 --> 00:21:23,080
what makes it a hard part?

869
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:24,520
So the crack is like thinner,

870
00:21:24,521 --> 00:21:27,310
so you have less of your finger inside
so you have to like pull harder and the

871
00:21:27,311 --> 00:21:28,750
fee get bad and it gets steeper.

872
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:31,030
So the angle of the walls is steeper.

873
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:31,840
Um,

874
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,310
basically it just becomes more strenuous.

875
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,500
But so both of those two
sections where maybe,

876
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:36,170
you know,

877
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:37,210
10 movements long,

878
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:38,500
he said there may be like 15,

879
00:21:38,501 --> 00:21:42,030
20 foot sections and I just have
to memorize like 10 or 15 moves.

880
00:21:42,031 --> 00:21:42,431
So where I'm like,

881
00:21:42,431 --> 00:21:42,641
okay.

882
00:21:42,641 --> 00:21:45,430
And then I do my left hand to that little
thing and then I pull really hard and

883
00:21:45,431 --> 00:21:46,241
then I raised my foot.

884
00:21:46,241 --> 00:21:46,820
You know that.

885
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:48,920
So as you're going up this in a rope,

886
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:53,870
are you just visualizing going along
it or you actually fitting it with your

887
00:21:53,871 --> 00:21:54,440
hands?

888
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:54,900
Yeah,

889
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:55,280
both.

890
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:55,580
I'm,

891
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:55,770
it's,

892
00:21:55,770 --> 00:21:56,850
I'm climbing it and then,

893
00:21:56,851 --> 00:21:57,180
um,

894
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:58,440
some of it I marched with chalk,

895
00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:00,090
which is totally normal for comments too.

896
00:22:00,091 --> 00:22:01,440
I put a little tick next to things.

897
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:03,720
So you remember like which
part of the crack is good.

898
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:05,280
And then I would memorize like,

899
00:22:05,281 --> 00:22:05,521
okay,

900
00:22:05,521 --> 00:22:06,780
this is the way to do it.

901
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,160
And then while I had the rope on,

902
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:11,220
I tried to a couple of different ways on
one part to see which felt more secure,

903
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:12,203
things like that.

904
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:14,340
And so do you take notes or do yes.

905
00:22:14,341 --> 00:22:16,470
And then afterwards when
I was all done and uh,

906
00:22:16,471 --> 00:22:16,711
you know,

907
00:22:16,711 --> 00:22:17,550
that evening I like,

908
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:20,460
I drew out the sequences and
I have like a climate journal.

909
00:22:20,461 --> 00:22:22,830
I keep track of things like that
and just make notes about life,

910
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:23,430
whatever.

911
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:25,560
And so I just mapped out the
sequences so I could remember it.

912
00:22:25,561 --> 00:22:26,010
Well.

913
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:27,240
And would you ever publish that?

914
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:28,380
Well,

915
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:28,631
no,

916
00:22:28,631 --> 00:22:29,660
it wouldn't make any sense to anybody.

917
00:22:29,661 --> 00:22:30,450
Is a bunch of lines.

918
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:31,350
Do you know who would buy it?

919
00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:32,363
That'd be dope.

920
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:33,960
Maybe a coffee table book.

921
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:35,220
I'll send you some lines

922
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:41,090
for a coffee table or maybe I,

923
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:43,080
I don't think I have enough volume
for that kind of thing either,

924
00:22:43,081 --> 00:22:43,771
but maybe someday.

925
00:22:43,771 --> 00:22:43,991
You know,

926
00:22:43,991 --> 00:22:44,660
if I didn't,

927
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:44,871
dude,

928
00:22:44,871 --> 00:22:47,850
I've really think there'll be a
dope coffee table book your map,

929
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:49,000
a little roots and stuff.

930
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:51,650
You're just musings on
life and a in a book for,

931
00:22:51,651 --> 00:22:52,670
I think people would see and be like,

932
00:22:52,671 --> 00:22:53,630
what the F no,

933
00:22:53,631 --> 00:22:55,850
with photographs of the
actual mountain itself.

934
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:57,040
I think that would actually be,

935
00:22:57,050 --> 00:22:57,291
I mean,

936
00:22:57,291 --> 00:22:57,800
if it was,

937
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:58,280
yeah,

938
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,200
if it was interspersed with real photos,

939
00:23:00,201 --> 00:23:01,550
like this is what it corresponds to.

940
00:23:01,551 --> 00:23:01,850
Maybe.

941
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:02,091
Yeah.

942
00:23:02,091 --> 00:23:02,571
I'm telling you,

943
00:23:02,571 --> 00:23:02,930
man,

944
00:23:02,930 --> 00:23:04,010
I don't even climb.

945
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:04,910
I would buy that shit,

946
00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:05,890
dude.

947
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:06,560
Yeah.

948
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,010
I'm telling you.

949
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:08,540
That's a golden opportunity.

950
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:09,201
Jump on it.

951
00:23:09,201 --> 00:23:11,240
Publishers find this young man.

952
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:13,493
Um,

953
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:14,540
have you ever been wrong?

954
00:23:14,541 --> 00:23:17,990
Have you ever done like a route and said,

955
00:23:17,991 --> 00:23:18,171
well,

956
00:23:18,171 --> 00:23:19,970
I'm going to go solo it now and been like,

957
00:23:19,971 --> 00:23:20,361
you know what,

958
00:23:20,361 --> 00:23:20,810
this is,

959
00:23:20,810 --> 00:23:21,591
this is an error.

960
00:23:21,591 --> 00:23:22,490
I shouldn't have done this.

961
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:23,740
Uh,

962
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:24,720
not so much.

963
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:25,860
I've had a handful,

964
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:26,111
I mean,

965
00:23:26,111 --> 00:23:27,040
I wouldn't call it an error,

966
00:23:27,041 --> 00:23:29,560
but I've had a handful of times where
I've gone out to solo something without

967
00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:30,700
pre-inspection where I'm just like,

968
00:23:30,701 --> 00:23:30,781
oh,

969
00:23:30,781 --> 00:23:32,260
I'm just going to go up
it and see how it goes.

970
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,210
And I go maybe halfway
up and I'm just like,

971
00:23:34,211 --> 00:23:34,501
well,

972
00:23:34,501 --> 00:23:35,410
I'm not feeling it.

973
00:23:35,411 --> 00:23:36,370
And then I just calmed back down.

974
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,771
So do you,

975
00:23:37,771 --> 00:23:38,160
um,

976
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:42,030
proceed if you know for sure that you
can't climb back down because you can't

977
00:23:42,031 --> 00:23:42,864
always,

978
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:43,950
can you always climb back?

979
00:23:43,951 --> 00:23:44,341
Generally?

980
00:23:44,341 --> 00:23:46,370
I can climb back almost always,

981
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:49,490
almost in the end if I know that I'm
about to like pass the point where there's

982
00:23:49,491 --> 00:23:50,390
like no,

983
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:52,250
no turning back then,

984
00:23:52,251 --> 00:23:52,461
you know,

985
00:23:52,461 --> 00:23:54,680
I sorta know that that's a
big deal and I think about it,

986
00:23:54,681 --> 00:23:54,831
you know,

987
00:23:54,831 --> 00:23:58,520
I think it through because on a 60
minutes piece that was actually something

988
00:23:58,521 --> 00:23:59,090
that I,

989
00:23:59,090 --> 00:23:59,281
yeah,

990
00:23:59,281 --> 00:24:00,520
the narrator who was talking about like,

991
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:00,651
oh,

992
00:24:00,651 --> 00:24:01,484
he can't correct.

993
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:01,731
Oh,

994
00:24:01,731 --> 00:24:02,181
actually I saw,

995
00:24:02,181 --> 00:24:03,020
I just had lunch with them.

996
00:24:03,021 --> 00:24:04,500
He's the guy I was hanging
out with it and uh,

997
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:05,503
and um,

998
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:06,890
whatever Venice or wherever it was.

999
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:07,521
And,

1000
00:24:07,521 --> 00:24:08,354
um,

1001
00:24:08,570 --> 00:24:08,901
uh,

1002
00:24:08,901 --> 00:24:09,501
well I don't know.

1003
00:24:09,501 --> 00:24:10,700
So he was a big,

1004
00:24:10,701 --> 00:24:13,550
big climber in the 70s and he established
a lot of those routes and all that.

1005
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:14,811
And I mean,

1006
00:24:14,811 --> 00:24:16,730
I know what he means that
it is harder to down climb,

1007
00:24:16,731 --> 00:24:18,560
but the thing is like nowadays,

1008
00:24:18,561 --> 00:24:21,140
I mean I don't know our practice down
climb and like I could down calm that,

1009
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:21,831
you know,

1010
00:24:21,831 --> 00:24:22,430
for sure.

1011
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:23,380
So I use just hating,

1012
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:24,081
no,

1013
00:24:24,081 --> 00:24:25,160
he wasn't hating but like,

1014
00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:27,020
but from his perspective,

1015
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:28,610
people don't down calm
and stuff like that.

1016
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:31,520
Maybe he was a little bit of hyperbole.

1017
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:31,791
Yeah,

1018
00:24:31,791 --> 00:24:32,624
a little bit,

1019
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:32,961
but not,

1020
00:24:32,961 --> 00:24:33,141
I mean,

1021
00:24:33,141 --> 00:24:34,760
I'm pretty sure the route on 60 minutes.

1022
00:24:34,761 --> 00:24:35,900
Like if I absolutely had to,

1023
00:24:35,901 --> 00:24:37,910
I could have hiked to the top
and then down climb the thing,

1024
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:38,670
you know,

1025
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:39,261
it could have been like,

1026
00:24:39,261 --> 00:24:39,381
oh,

1027
00:24:39,381 --> 00:24:40,670
we're filming it in reverse,

1028
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:41,030
you know,

1029
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:41,450
shit,

1030
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:42,770
it would be a lot less rad like that.

1031
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:43,311
He'd be like,

1032
00:24:43,311 --> 00:24:44,220
that's fucking stupid,

1033
00:24:44,221 --> 00:24:45,290
that guy coming down the mountain,

1034
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:46,341
you know?

1035
00:24:46,341 --> 00:24:48,170
But it's still just as scary,

1036
00:24:48,171 --> 00:24:49,080
but I see what you're saying.

1037
00:24:49,081 --> 00:24:50,630
Like it doesn't give
you that satisfaction.

1038
00:24:50,631 --> 00:24:50,880
Yeah,

1039
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:51,300
exactly.

1040
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:52,330
Climbing up the mountain,

1041
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:55,510
you do a really hard hike and then you
freaking do extremely dangerous down

1042
00:24:55,511 --> 00:24:55,850
climb.

1043
00:24:55,850 --> 00:24:57,860
If you ever climb to the top
of something and then realize,

1044
00:24:57,861 --> 00:24:58,694
Holy Shit,

1045
00:24:58,780 --> 00:24:59,180
um,

1046
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:01,130
I have to climb down
because I can't walk down.

1047
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:03,740
There's no other way to
get down a little bit.

1048
00:25:03,741 --> 00:25:05,600
I've had a handful of
like epics like that.

1049
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,410
But yeah,

1050
00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:12,470
a couple of my gnarliest experiences
have been a topping out routes that you

1051
00:25:12,471 --> 00:25:14,000
conventionally a repel down.

1052
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:15,440
But since I don't have a robe on me,

1053
00:25:15,441 --> 00:25:15,831
I'm like,

1054
00:25:15,831 --> 00:25:16,131
okay,

1055
00:25:16,131 --> 00:25:18,080
I'll just pioneer some
kind of new descent.

1056
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,273
And um,

1057
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:21,170
so a couple of them involve,

1058
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,820
do you know Zion National Park in Utah?

1059
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:24,520
It's like a really Pretty River Canyon.

1060
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:25,470
It's like sandstones.

1061
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:26,110
It's,

1062
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:26,943
it's beautiful.

1063
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:27,943
But um,

1064
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:29,840
it's like a thousand foot wall.

1065
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:33,020
And then the rim of the Canyon is like
2000 feet above it and it's a really,

1066
00:25:33,021 --> 00:25:34,070
really steep sandstone.

1067
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:37,310
And normally you would climb a thousand
feet and then repelled back down and be

1068
00:25:37,311 --> 00:25:37,461
like,

1069
00:25:37,461 --> 00:25:37,581
oh,

1070
00:25:37,581 --> 00:25:38,180
sweet.

1071
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:41,060
So I climbed the thousand foot wall and
then I'm up there and it's like 2000

1072
00:25:41,061 --> 00:25:44,520
feet are really steep and it was all
covered in like snow or it sorta like

1073
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,070
consolidated hail is all messed up.

1074
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:46,670
Oh,

1075
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:48,020
super hard to scramble and you know,

1076
00:25:48,021 --> 00:25:49,610
cause they're like roads anyway.

1077
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:51,830
And then it started snowing
as soon as I hop out.

1078
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:56,250
And so I was like clawing my way up this
hail in like this driving blizzard and

1079
00:25:56,251 --> 00:25:56,871
I it actually,

1080
00:25:56,871 --> 00:25:58,880
and then that blizzard
while you were up there.

1081
00:25:59,030 --> 00:25:59,391
Yeah.

1082
00:25:59,391 --> 00:25:59,661
Well,

1083
00:25:59,661 --> 00:26:01,700
so the day that I decided to do,

1084
00:26:01,701 --> 00:26:02,330
I was,

1085
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:03,500
I was a little angst for and I was like,

1086
00:26:03,501 --> 00:26:07,220
I'm going to do this goddammit and
hold it at the time is like last,

1087
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,690
this is the last February a year ago.

1088
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:09,943
But um,

1089
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:10,880
but uh,

1090
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,790
so the forecast that there is going to
start snowing at noon and I was like,

1091
00:26:13,791 --> 00:26:14,360
well,

1092
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,140
you know,

1093
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:15,980
I'll finish by then.

1094
00:26:16,050 --> 00:26:16,761
So I finished it.

1095
00:26:16,761 --> 00:26:18,110
I finished at like 1130.

1096
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:20,930
It started snowing right
on schedule and I was like,

1097
00:26:20,931 --> 00:26:21,501
oh no problem.

1098
00:26:21,501 --> 00:26:22,071
I'll hike off.

1099
00:26:22,071 --> 00:26:22,431
The thing is,

1100
00:26:22,431 --> 00:26:23,750
even once I made it to the rim,

1101
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:25,070
which took me forever and it was,

1102
00:26:25,071 --> 00:26:27,320
I was getting pretty wet and pretty
cold and it was kind of messed up and

1103
00:26:27,321 --> 00:26:28,340
visibility was so low,

1104
00:26:28,341 --> 00:26:29,300
I was worried about getting lost.

1105
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:30,770
And then once you're up on the top,

1106
00:26:30,771 --> 00:26:31,940
it's just a big plateau.

1107
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:35,150
And I was hoping to hit this one trail
that it was like a 10 mile hike on the

1108
00:26:35,151 --> 00:26:37,310
trail back around to get back to the car.

1109
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:38,260
And uh,

1110
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:41,480
even though it's all just a field of snow
and like whiteout blizzard style and I

1111
00:26:41,481 --> 00:26:43,440
was just running along in
my climbing shoes like,

1112
00:26:43,441 --> 00:26:43,681
God,

1113
00:26:43,681 --> 00:26:44,760
I Hope I can find something.

1114
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:47,460
But miraculously I found the trail and
made it all the way out and there's no

1115
00:26:47,461 --> 00:26:47,790
problem.

1116
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:49,100
Oh Shit.

1117
00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:51,890
But as you apply yourself and all
these experiences he has pretty at,

1118
00:26:51,891 --> 00:26:53,280
that was a satellite phone?

1119
00:26:53,281 --> 00:26:53,401
No,

1120
00:26:53,401 --> 00:26:53,940
nothing.

1121
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:54,773
Satellite phone.

1122
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:57,810
Why would I have a satellite phone?

1123
00:26:57,860 --> 00:26:59,400
The climate at the top of a mountain.

1124
00:26:59,700 --> 00:26:59,911
No,

1125
00:26:59,911 --> 00:27:00,241
I mean,

1126
00:27:00,241 --> 00:27:01,100
well the,

1127
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,430
the thing with that though is like,

1128
00:27:02,431 --> 00:27:03,241
so the whole time I did,

1129
00:27:03,241 --> 00:27:03,571
I was like,

1130
00:27:03,571 --> 00:27:04,710
this is hardcore.

1131
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:05,260
You know,

1132
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:06,510
and then as soon as I was back at the car,

1133
00:27:06,511 --> 00:27:07,230
I was like,

1134
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:07,680
well,

1135
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:08,700
it's like noon.

1136
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,680
I had a very eventful morning,

1137
00:27:10,681 --> 00:27:11,131
but like,

1138
00:27:11,131 --> 00:27:12,360
it doesn't even feel like a full day,

1139
00:27:12,361 --> 00:27:12,781
you know what I mean?

1140
00:27:12,781 --> 00:27:13,281
The whole thing,

1141
00:27:13,281 --> 00:27:15,300
like the whole thing like feels
surreal because you're like,

1142
00:27:15,301 --> 00:27:16,110
did I just do that?

1143
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:16,291
Like,

1144
00:27:16,291 --> 00:27:17,124
that was weird.

1145
00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:18,750
You only took a few hours
where you're just like,

1146
00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:19,410
whoa.

1147
00:27:19,410 --> 00:27:20,340
Wow.

1148
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,890
Was that the most harrowing
experience you've ever been on?

1149
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:23,221
No.

1150
00:27:23,221 --> 00:27:23,551
For sure.

1151
00:27:23,551 --> 00:27:23,701
No,

1152
00:27:23,701 --> 00:27:24,121
but it was,

1153
00:27:24,121 --> 00:27:24,890
but it for sure.

1154
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:25,291
What was it?

1155
00:27:25,291 --> 00:27:26,400
Very invigorating morning,

1156
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:27,263
you know,

1157
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:32,010
what is the most hair raising
experience you've ever had?

1158
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:32,970
I,

1159
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:33,803
I dunno,

1160
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:34,570
I mean,

1161
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:35,370
it depends what you call her,

1162
00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:35,820
raising.

1163
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,560
What's the most difficult
climb you've ever done?

1164
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:39,980
I Dunno.

1165
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:40,813
Um,

1166
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:41,941
I mean,

1167
00:27:41,941 --> 00:27:42,331
again,

1168
00:27:42,331 --> 00:27:42,600
you know,

1169
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,190
I need like tighter definitions.

1170
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,030
Okay.

1171
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:45,480
Um,

1172
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:49,530
has there ever been a climb
that you did where you,

1173
00:27:49,531 --> 00:27:50,430
you realize like,

1174
00:27:50,431 --> 00:27:50,731
wow,

1175
00:27:50,731 --> 00:27:54,420
that might have been the most strenuous,

1176
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:56,310
the hardest I've ever had to work?

1177
00:27:56,570 --> 00:27:57,060
Yeah.

1178
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:57,691
I have not yet.

1179
00:27:57,691 --> 00:27:57,871
Shit,

1180
00:27:57,871 --> 00:27:58,570
my pants docker,

1181
00:27:58,570 --> 00:27:59,403
I'm close,

1182
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:02,430
but I'm so for free soloing maybe.

1183
00:28:02,431 --> 00:28:03,264
Um,

1184
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,100
the first time I free soloed half to him,

1185
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:06,420
which was in 2008.

1186
00:28:06,421 --> 00:28:08,310
I think at the time.

1187
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,380
I think it was maybe a
little bit much for me.

1188
00:28:10,770 --> 00:28:11,011
You know,

1189
00:28:11,011 --> 00:28:12,120
like when I finished I was like,

1190
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:12,983
Ooh,

1191
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:14,820
maybe not that I like got away with it,

1192
00:28:14,821 --> 00:28:15,840
but that's kind of the feeling,

1193
00:28:15,841 --> 00:28:15,991
you know,

1194
00:28:15,991 --> 00:28:17,040
you get to the top and you're like,

1195
00:28:17,041 --> 00:28:17,874
Whoa,

1196
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:19,710
we are for sure.

1197
00:28:19,711 --> 00:28:20,490
I was like,

1198
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:20,731
yeah,

1199
00:28:20,731 --> 00:28:23,900
because the one of the hardest and least
secure parts of the whole climb is up

1200
00:28:23,901 --> 00:28:24,600
at the very top.

1201
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,730
So you're at like the
top of a 2000 foot wall.

1202
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,073
And um,

1203
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:30,630
and it took me like two 50
to climb the whole route.

1204
00:28:30,631 --> 00:28:34,250
So I was probably up there at two
35 at this like super hard part.

1205
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:35,910
I'm already kind of frazzled and you know,

1206
00:28:35,911 --> 00:28:38,730
because you've been really focused
for like two and a half hours,

1207
00:28:38,731 --> 00:28:41,010
like trying really hard and you're just
getting a little tired and whatever,

1208
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:43,800
and then you get to the hardest
part that's also the least secure.

1209
00:28:43,801 --> 00:28:45,090
It's a really insecure style.

1210
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,780
It's like they're no actual
holds to hold on to it.

1211
00:28:46,781 --> 00:28:49,100
It's just like a bald slab that,

1212
00:28:49,101 --> 00:28:51,030
and you just wait your feet and so,

1213
00:28:51,031 --> 00:28:51,270
uh,

1214
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:52,290
you just have to eat your feet.

1215
00:28:52,291 --> 00:28:53,670
What do you mean means like,

1216
00:28:53,671 --> 00:28:55,050
so you're wearing really
tight climbing shoes.

1217
00:28:55,051 --> 00:28:57,540
It's like really precise edges
on them and you basically just,

1218
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:01,140
it'd be like if you took that brick wall
and you like leaned it back and made it

1219
00:29:01,141 --> 00:29:03,810
a little smoother and then all you can
do is stand on the little edges of the

1220
00:29:03,811 --> 00:29:04,644
bricks,

1221
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:05,580
you know,

1222
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:06,200
actually,

1223
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,550
well if you tilt it it
back to like 87 degrees.

1224
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:11,490
You could probably walk up that wall
with no hands but just the edges,

1225
00:29:11,491 --> 00:29:11,790
you know.

1226
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:13,530
But it would chill around about that.

1227
00:29:13,531 --> 00:29:16,380
You would look at this wall
and start thinking about roots.

1228
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:20,570
Well you see a wall and look
for areas I love little bit,

1229
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:21,503
a little bit.

1230
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:24,930
Is there a difference between that guy
who does your type of stuff like mountain

1231
00:29:24,931 --> 00:29:27,660
climbing stuff and those crazy
dudes or climb buildings?

1232
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:28,680
No,

1233
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,180
I mean he's still just climbing stuff.

1234
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:31,530
Deep practice on the floor.

1235
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,360
Do you like practice
climbing on the floor?

1236
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,580
Would that be called laying down?

1237
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:38,081
I mean like,

1238
00:29:38,081 --> 00:29:38,260
like,

1239
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:38,441
like,

1240
00:29:38,441 --> 00:29:40,440
like would Brian shut the fuck up?

1241
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:41,170
I,

1242
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:42,610
I do push back.

1243
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:44,650
How do you,

1244
00:29:44,651 --> 00:29:44,860
uh,

1245
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:45,700
do you have like a,

1246
00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:49,420
a strength or conditioning program
that you did a bunch of us do a lot of,

1247
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:51,190
a little bit when I'm motivated.

1248
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:52,660
Like I did a bunch of planks this morning,

1249
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:53,680
but I don't know.

1250
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:54,910
Does it help your climbing?

1251
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:55,640
I Dunno,

1252
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,140
that's the,

1253
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:56,771
that's the thing.

1254
00:29:56,771 --> 00:29:58,600
But I mean it makes my
core is wrong if you're,

1255
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,340
if you're climbing has done right.

1256
00:30:00,341 --> 00:30:02,770
How much of it actually does
involve physical strength?

1257
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:03,580
A fair,

1258
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:04,320
um,

1259
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,040
a fair amount,

1260
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:05,590
fair amount.

1261
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:06,423
Eventually.

1262
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:08,380
The thing you said what I was
just talking about a slab,

1263
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:08,691
you know,

1264
00:30:08,691 --> 00:30:11,590
that's all about technique and precision
with footwork and all that kind of

1265
00:30:11,591 --> 00:30:11,751
thing.

1266
00:30:11,751 --> 00:30:12,700
That's all mental and,

1267
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:14,890
and I mean you have to have
toned calves or whatever,

1268
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:16,083
but um,

1269
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:18,970
but then if you tip a wall back the
other way and you're climbing out,

1270
00:30:18,971 --> 00:30:20,980
so I'm kind of like
overhanging ceiling then.

1271
00:30:20,981 --> 00:30:21,251
I mean,

1272
00:30:21,251 --> 00:30:23,350
it really does come down to
having strong arms and strong.

1273
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:24,390
Yeah.

1274
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:25,223
Yeah.

1275
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:26,111
I mean in general,

1276
00:30:26,111 --> 00:30:27,160
for a recreational climber,

1277
00:30:27,161 --> 00:30:29,470
you should be using your feet and you
should be using good technique and you

1278
00:30:29,471 --> 00:30:30,910
should keep your weight over your legs.

1279
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:31,571
But,

1280
00:30:31,571 --> 00:30:31,840
um,

1281
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,430
but when you get into
really high end climbing,

1282
00:30:33,431 --> 00:30:33,781
it's like,

1283
00:30:33,781 --> 00:30:34,080
um,

1284
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:34,540
you know,

1285
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:36,080
you just gotta be able
to pull really hard too.

1286
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:41,980
I saw a video or a photograph
of you holding onto some
pillars or some beams and

1287
00:30:41,981 --> 00:30:42,551
doing chin.

1288
00:30:42,551 --> 00:30:43,180
Oh yeah,

1289
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:43,870
yeah,

1290
00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:44,230
yeah.

1291
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:45,063
Can you do that?

1292
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:45,850
You really can.

1293
00:30:45,850 --> 00:30:47,380
You can work as a photo of it.

1294
00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:52,610
I mean if the beacon actually Ergonomic
flop and move and not just hold there.

1295
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:54,341
Yeah,

1296
00:30:54,341 --> 00:30:54,641
I was,

1297
00:30:54,641 --> 00:30:54,891
yeah,

1298
00:30:54,891 --> 00:30:56,860
I could do like two pull
ups on those BMC for,

1299
00:30:56,861 --> 00:30:57,694
I'd fall over.

1300
00:30:58,090 --> 00:30:59,650
I mean it was really hard
for me to hold on to them.

1301
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:00,161
Yeah.

1302
00:31:00,161 --> 00:31:00,970
I would imagine though.

1303
00:31:00,970 --> 00:31:03,250
But that's gotta be pretty rare
that someone can even do it too.

1304
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:04,031
Well,

1305
00:31:04,031 --> 00:31:06,670
but I mean there are plenty of dudes
who were a lot stronger and that kind of

1306
00:31:06,671 --> 00:31:09,030
thing that I am is that uh,

1307
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:13,600
cause I've heard crazy stories about these
free solo climber is being able to do

1308
00:31:13,601 --> 00:31:16,750
chin ups with one finger and a thing.

1309
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:17,883
You can do that.

1310
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:18,610
Um,

1311
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:19,900
right now I could probably do two,

1312
00:31:20,050 --> 00:31:20,883
two fingers.

1313
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:24,360
When I was a kid I could do like a one
finger one on I think not in to one

1314
00:31:24,370 --> 00:31:24,731
finger,

1315
00:31:24,731 --> 00:31:25,211
one arm,

1316
00:31:25,211 --> 00:31:26,044
Chin up.

1317
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:26,621
Yeah.

1318
00:31:26,621 --> 00:31:27,760
I mean hanging off like a slang,

1319
00:31:27,761 --> 00:31:27,971
you know,

1320
00:31:27,971 --> 00:31:29,140
like a little piece of rope or something.

1321
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:31,000
That's the photo of you hanging in there.

1322
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:31,943
Oh yeah.

1323
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:32,291
Yeah.

1324
00:31:32,291 --> 00:31:33,430
Classic that Ah,

1325
00:31:33,431 --> 00:31:34,660
that chalk stuff's huge,

1326
00:31:34,661 --> 00:31:35,290
Huh?

1327
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:35,471
Well,

1328
00:31:35,471 --> 00:31:35,651
yeah.

1329
00:31:35,651 --> 00:31:37,870
I mean the same as gymnast and
everything keeps your hands dry.

1330
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:38,171
Yeah.

1331
00:31:38,171 --> 00:31:40,270
You do you ever Solo
something without chalk?

1332
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:41,770
You look at it and like I'm
going to need chalk for that.

1333
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:42,221
Uh,

1334
00:31:42,221 --> 00:31:42,491
no.

1335
00:31:42,491 --> 00:31:45,730
You pretty much always take a chalk bag
unless it's like real easy and I'm just

1336
00:31:45,731 --> 00:31:46,564
scrambling up it.

1337
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,860
Have you ever lost a chalk bag?

1338
00:31:47,890 --> 00:31:48,541
I have actually.

1339
00:31:48,541 --> 00:31:49,360
It's,

1340
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:52,200
if it's funny you ask this last summer,

1341
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:54,790
like one of the biggest things
that I've done solving the triple,

1342
00:31:54,791 --> 00:31:57,370
which was like climbing in three
big faces and he's 17 in a day.

1343
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:58,713
Um,

1344
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:01,320
the second thing that I
climbed was El Capitan,

1345
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:02,560
just like a 3000 foot face.

1346
00:32:02,561 --> 00:32:03,860
And I climbed it through
the night and accident.

1347
00:32:03,890 --> 00:32:06,210
I forgot my chalk bag at
the bottom and I was like,

1348
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:07,030
God,

1349
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:07,241
yeah.

1350
00:32:07,241 --> 00:32:08,760
And so when I was all
ready to start climbing,

1351
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:09,210
I was like,

1352
00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:09,980
ah,

1353
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:10,690
damn it,

1354
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:11,170
you know?

1355
00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:13,720
And actually it was kind of messed up
cause the root was kind of wet because it

1356
00:32:13,721 --> 00:32:15,070
rained a lot the day before.

1357
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:16,750
And so it's the kind of
thing where you like,

1358
00:32:16,751 --> 00:32:17,980
you really want to chalk bag.

1359
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,210
But um,

1360
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:19,631
I was like,

1361
00:32:19,631 --> 00:32:20,590
well bummer.

1362
00:32:20,591 --> 00:32:21,100
You know,

1363
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:23,680
and then I did the first 800 feet
and then I actually passed a party.

1364
00:32:23,681 --> 00:32:26,380
He was sleeping on the route because
most people climbing over like four days.

1365
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,273
What?

1366
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:27,851
Yeah.

1367
00:32:27,851 --> 00:32:29,190
Well I mean a 3000 foot faces.

1368
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:29,890
So you've,

1369
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:33,940
you saw a guy that was like camped out
on one of those crazy outcropping tents.

1370
00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:34,631
Yeah,

1371
00:32:34,631 --> 00:32:34,941
that was,

1372
00:32:34,941 --> 00:32:35,140
yeah,

1373
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:35,771
they were actually,

1374
00:32:35,771 --> 00:32:36,011
it was,

1375
00:32:36,011 --> 00:32:37,240
so it's kind of a standard ledge.

1376
00:32:37,241 --> 00:32:38,940
It's like where people
generally camp on the roads of,

1377
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:41,690
well it's like the size
of half this table,

1378
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:42,651
you know what I mean?

1379
00:32:42,651 --> 00:32:43,310
So it's like,

1380
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:44,240
but so there were two parties,

1381
00:32:44,241 --> 00:32:44,900
the two guys,

1382
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:47,630
and they were all camped on it and so
they each had their little tents that

1383
00:32:47,631 --> 00:32:48,464
you're talking about.

1384
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:49,010
So that,

1385
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:49,311
you know,

1386
00:32:49,311 --> 00:32:50,270
cause there's not much room,

1387
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:52,910
so it's half the size of this
table and everybody's on it.

1388
00:32:52,911 --> 00:32:53,744
And the big party.

1389
00:32:53,810 --> 00:32:54,230
Yeah.

1390
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:56,540
But that's pretty comfortable
converted hanging on a vertical face,

1391
00:32:56,541 --> 00:32:56,730
you know?

1392
00:32:56,730 --> 00:32:57,110
Right.

1393
00:32:57,110 --> 00:32:57,381
You're like,

1394
00:32:57,381 --> 00:32:57,771
oh sweet,

1395
00:32:57,771 --> 00:32:58,361
I can stand,

1396
00:32:58,361 --> 00:32:59,540
you can take off your harness if you want,

1397
00:32:59,930 --> 00:33:00,560
whatever.

1398
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,080
Anyway though,

1399
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:01,600
it's our past,

1400
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:02,610
these dudes in the middle of the night,

1401
00:33:02,611 --> 00:33:04,640
you were camping there and the guy
gave me a chalk bag and I was like,

1402
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:05,880
oh wow.

1403
00:33:05,910 --> 00:33:06,950
So then when I got to the top,

1404
00:33:06,951 --> 00:33:08,250
I tied out after this little tree,

1405
00:33:08,251 --> 00:33:09,320
so then he got it back later.

1406
00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:10,371
So,

1407
00:33:10,371 --> 00:33:10,530
uh,

1408
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:11,363
that's pretty cool.

1409
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:12,200
So it's like,

1410
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,370
so you just kept going,

1411
00:33:13,371 --> 00:33:13,950
you climbed the,

1412
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:14,690
the whole thing.

1413
00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:15,940
And once you got the chalk bag,

1414
00:33:15,941 --> 00:33:16,550
you're like,

1415
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:17,420
then it was game on,

1416
00:33:17,421 --> 00:33:18,254
you know?

1417
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:20,270
Oh my God,

1418
00:33:20,271 --> 00:33:21,620
what did they say to you when you're like,

1419
00:33:21,621 --> 00:33:22,550
I forgot my chalk.

1420
00:33:22,551 --> 00:33:23,940
We like what the fuck man.

1421
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:24,651
Little bit.

1422
00:33:24,651 --> 00:33:25,490
I think they were like,

1423
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:26,503
Huh?

1424
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:29,540
The fact that they were up
there for like five days,

1425
00:33:29,541 --> 00:33:30,140
you know,

1426
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:32,210
and that this dude climbs
through and he's like,

1427
00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:32,871
excuse me,

1428
00:33:32,871 --> 00:33:33,740
do you have any chalk?

1429
00:33:33,770 --> 00:33:34,310
And they were like,

1430
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:36,240
what the fuck is this guy going know?

1431
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,860
But I actually saw,

1432
00:33:39,861 --> 00:33:40,710
I met that guy again.

1433
00:33:41,550 --> 00:33:44,240
I think that's his favorite story
because I've probably met like half the

1434
00:33:44,241 --> 00:33:45,200
climbers on the west coast.

1435
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:45,381
You're like,

1436
00:33:45,381 --> 00:33:46,100
hey you,

1437
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:47,330
you met my buddy Steve.

1438
00:33:47,331 --> 00:33:47,781
He gave me,

1439
00:33:47,781 --> 00:33:48,890
you gave him this chalk bag,

1440
00:33:48,891 --> 00:33:50,360
whatever gave you his chalk bag.

1441
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:52,280
I've met like a dozen
people who were like,

1442
00:33:52,281 --> 00:33:52,461
Hey,

1443
00:33:52,461 --> 00:33:53,450
I met this guy that,

1444
00:33:53,510 --> 00:33:54,320
you know,

1445
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,450
I think there are a pretty sight,

1446
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:55,671
you know,

1447
00:33:55,671 --> 00:33:56,780
just cause it's a funny story.

1448
00:33:56,930 --> 00:33:57,151
Oh,

1449
00:33:57,151 --> 00:33:58,400
it's a very funny story.

1450
00:33:58,401 --> 00:33:59,840
It's a very crazy story though,

1451
00:33:59,841 --> 00:34:00,200
man.

1452
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:04,820
Just your reality is your reality to you.

1453
00:34:04,821 --> 00:34:06,050
It's just normal.

1454
00:34:06,051 --> 00:34:06,231
Yeah.

1455
00:34:06,231 --> 00:34:06,341
Cause,

1456
00:34:06,341 --> 00:34:06,980
I mean that's,

1457
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:07,850
that's normal.

1458
00:34:07,970 --> 00:34:08,571
But I'm serious.

1459
00:34:08,571 --> 00:34:09,291
I'm talking to you.

1460
00:34:09,291 --> 00:34:10,400
My hands are sweaty.

1461
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:11,563
I get sweaty,

1462
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:15,710
I think about high heights and
I get like the butterfly thing.

1463
00:34:15,711 --> 00:34:18,020
I could think about it being like high up,

1464
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:19,183
I can do that.

1465
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:20,120
I freak myself out.

1466
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:23,270
Do you look at like when you're at a
building and so do you think are in

1467
00:34:23,271 --> 00:34:25,400
climates pitch do you to
look at things like that?

1468
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:25,971
I don't know.

1469
00:34:25,971 --> 00:34:26,211
I mean,

1470
00:34:26,211 --> 00:34:27,470
buildings I do look at and I'm like,

1471
00:34:27,471 --> 00:34:29,210
oh that'd be rad except you get arrested.

1472
00:34:29,211 --> 00:34:30,470
So I kind of nipped that in the bud,

1473
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:31,430
you know?

1474
00:34:31,430 --> 00:34:32,420
But with rocks for sure.

1475
00:34:32,421 --> 00:34:34,000
I mean you see some things,

1476
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:34,341
you just,

1477
00:34:34,341 --> 00:34:34,671
you're like,

1478
00:34:34,671 --> 00:34:36,230
that looks red and I'd love to climb that.

1479
00:34:36,231 --> 00:34:39,020
Two climbers ever do things
like that for publicity stunts.

1480
00:34:39,021 --> 00:34:41,000
Like know that they're going to get
arrested but just climb something.

1481
00:34:41,001 --> 00:34:41,270
Anyone?

1482
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:41,341
Yeah.

1483
00:34:41,341 --> 00:34:42,830
I mean surely you've heard of,

1484
00:34:42,890 --> 00:34:44,920
I don't want her bear the Alhambra bear,

1485
00:34:44,930 --> 00:34:48,020
the French solos guy who did the New
York Times building and it's like climbed

1486
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,550
pretty much every skyscraper in the world.

1487
00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:50,451
You know what?

1488
00:34:50,451 --> 00:34:52,040
Probably peripherally.

1489
00:34:52,041 --> 00:34:52,791
I've heard of that guy,

1490
00:34:52,791 --> 00:34:56,150
but I've never talked to you when you
talking about dude Solon and skyscrapers,

1491
00:34:56,450 --> 00:34:58,460
he's the only dude long skyscrapers.

1492
00:34:58,490 --> 00:34:58,731
Yeah.

1493
00:34:58,731 --> 00:35:00,560
Like any skyscraper you've
heard of being solid.

1494
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:01,370
It's that guy.

1495
00:35:01,370 --> 00:35:03,140
And they don't lock them up for one.

1496
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:03,351
Well,

1497
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:03,531
no,

1498
00:35:03,531 --> 00:35:05,360
I mean he's been arrested
and tons of times,

1499
00:35:05,361 --> 00:35:07,850
like you talked that you talked
about some building in Japan.

1500
00:35:07,851 --> 00:35:09,740
He got punched in the
face by a security guard.

1501
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:11,060
You know,

1502
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:12,260
he's had all kinds of weird stories.

1503
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,100
But um,

1504
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:16,010
I met him in Poland at this film
festival thing last year and I was like,

1505
00:35:16,011 --> 00:35:16,470
oh that's,

1506
00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:19,070
it's great to meet him actually because
he was like a really good climber,

1507
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:22,190
like in the eighties and nineties and
then he sort of transitioned into,

1508
00:35:22,191 --> 00:35:22,401
like,

1509
00:35:22,401 --> 00:35:22,790
he,

1510
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:24,500
he doesn't even call
himself a climber anymore.

1511
00:35:24,501 --> 00:35:24,981
He's just like,

1512
00:35:24,981 --> 00:35:25,161
oh,

1513
00:35:25,161 --> 00:35:25,560
you know,

1514
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:26,391
just climb buildings.

1515
00:35:26,391 --> 00:35:26,781
It's fun.

1516
00:35:26,781 --> 00:35:27,081
Whatever.

1517
00:35:27,081 --> 00:35:27,914
It's like as a job.

1518
00:35:28,370 --> 00:35:30,670
But so does he sell books or does dude,

1519
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:30,891
yeah,

1520
00:35:30,891 --> 00:35:32,210
he does like speaking stuff.

1521
00:35:32,211 --> 00:35:35,780
Apparently books like some
of the buildings that he
gets paid for it because you

1522
00:35:35,781 --> 00:35:35,871
know,

1523
00:35:35,871 --> 00:35:39,450
like in the Middle East they like unveil
like the biggest building in the world

1524
00:35:39,451 --> 00:35:41,560
or whatever and then they pay
him to climate and you know,

1525
00:35:42,610 --> 00:35:43,030
whenever,

1526
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:43,260
you know,

1527
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:44,090
there was a guy,

1528
00:35:44,090 --> 00:35:44,361
uh,

1529
00:35:44,361 --> 00:35:45,210
I don't know if it was him,

1530
00:35:45,211 --> 00:35:47,310
but someone was doing something recently.

1531
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:48,240
It was on the news,

1532
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:50,580
I just slipped was walking through an
airport or something and the guy had

1533
00:35:50,581 --> 00:35:52,630
suction cups and it's climbing
up some fucking night.

1534
00:35:54,090 --> 00:35:55,800
Tom Cruise in mission impossible.

1535
00:35:56,730 --> 00:35:57,690
I don't think so.

1536
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:59,070
I think it was an actual real person.

1537
00:35:59,490 --> 00:35:59,870
Yeah.

1538
00:35:59,870 --> 00:36:02,000
Some guy he didn't think
that should exist in,

1539
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:02,421
yeah,

1540
00:36:02,421 --> 00:36:02,611
yeah,

1541
00:36:02,611 --> 00:36:03,090
yeah.

1542
00:36:03,090 --> 00:36:03,800
Oh it does.

1543
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:04,201
Oh yeah.

1544
00:36:04,201 --> 00:36:07,500
He was climbing up a glass building
and he was using suction cups.

1545
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:08,603
You can,

1546
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:09,451
yeah,

1547
00:36:09,451 --> 00:36:11,190
you can actually do it
seems like it'd be scary.

1548
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:11,461
Yeah,

1549
00:36:11,461 --> 00:36:12,091
it was real scary.

1550
00:36:12,091 --> 00:36:12,924
He was also,

1551
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:15,650
one time it was another video
of another building and get out.

1552
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:17,430
He was in a crack like this,

1553
00:36:17,431 --> 00:36:22,431
like it was like a v crack going smaller
as it got away from him and he was

1554
00:36:22,561 --> 00:36:23,650
climbing the wall that way.

1555
00:36:23,651 --> 00:36:25,920
It just pressing up against
the wall and climbing that way.

1556
00:36:26,790 --> 00:36:28,140
There's probably a set standard,

1557
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:29,400
like a standard technique.

1558
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:29,671
Yeah,

1559
00:36:29,671 --> 00:36:30,180
for sure.

1560
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:32,070
Do you ever get yourself in a situation
like that where that's how you're

1561
00:36:32,071 --> 00:36:32,461
climbing,

1562
00:36:32,461 --> 00:36:36,840
you're pressing up against the wall and
that's actually a lot easier probably

1563
00:36:36,841 --> 00:36:38,280
than it might look to you really.

1564
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:39,061
Probably.

1565
00:36:39,061 --> 00:36:39,271
I mean,

1566
00:36:39,271 --> 00:36:41,580
generally when you're doing any kind of
counter pressure type stuff like that,

1567
00:36:41,581 --> 00:36:42,510
like pushing two sides,

1568
00:36:42,511 --> 00:36:42,721
I mean,

1569
00:36:42,721 --> 00:36:44,940
you're using your whole body as
opposed to just your fingers.

1570
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:45,330
Right?

1571
00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:46,270
So I mean it's not that,

1572
00:36:46,350 --> 00:36:47,183
not that strenuous,

1573
00:36:47,730 --> 00:36:49,020
depending on how,

1574
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,160
what the angle is and everything.

1575
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:51,120
My God.

1576
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:54,600
But we know how little kids loved to
like chimney up like doorframes were

1577
00:36:54,601 --> 00:36:55,380
hallways or whatever.

1578
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:55,681
Yes.

1579
00:36:55,681 --> 00:36:57,840
You know where you put your backhands
one side of your feet together.

1580
00:36:57,841 --> 00:36:58,021
I mean,

1581
00:36:58,021 --> 00:36:58,770
that's pretty,

1582
00:36:58,770 --> 00:37:00,720
pretty stable and you know,

1583
00:37:00,721 --> 00:37:01,554
it's easy to do.

1584
00:37:02,990 --> 00:37:03,420
You know,

1585
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:04,230
what is that?

1586
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:05,640
Here's the guy saying he's got the,

1587
00:37:05,770 --> 00:37:06,041
Oh yeah,

1588
00:37:06,041 --> 00:37:06,360
that's it.

1589
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:06,881
That's it.

1590
00:37:06,881 --> 00:37:08,970
That line we're bear does
he has suction cups up?

1591
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:09,220
No,

1592
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:10,053
not in this one.

1593
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:11,260
But that's actually quite easy.

1594
00:37:11,261 --> 00:37:11,601
I mean he,

1595
00:37:11,601 --> 00:37:12,730
he can go now hands right,

1596
00:37:12,970 --> 00:37:13,391
right there.

1597
00:37:13,391 --> 00:37:14,224
You know,

1598
00:37:14,290 --> 00:37:17,290
so then when he has to do the
movements in between levels,

1599
00:37:17,291 --> 00:37:18,124
this is insane.

1600
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:19,330
You think this looks easy?

1601
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:20,213
Yeah.

1602
00:37:21,970 --> 00:37:22,630
But yeah,

1603
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:24,640
I mean not that I'm
diminishing as accomplishment,

1604
00:37:24,641 --> 00:37:25,001
but like,

1605
00:37:25,001 --> 00:37:28,540
but that particular like feet of
climbing does not look hard at all.

1606
00:37:28,810 --> 00:37:29,470
You should be an,

1607
00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:30,580
you should become a tagger.

1608
00:37:30,610 --> 00:37:34,900
You'd be like the ultimate tagger but
that goes back to what not when you got

1609
00:37:34,901 --> 00:37:35,321
arrested,

1610
00:37:35,321 --> 00:37:36,154
you know,

1611
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:39,120
you dress up as Spiderman or some bitch.

1612
00:37:39,410 --> 00:37:39,611
Yeah,

1613
00:37:39,611 --> 00:37:40,220
exactly.

1614
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:41,053
Put that

1615
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,570
totally like Carrie
paint with you and stuff.

1616
00:37:43,571 --> 00:37:44,404
So knowing,

1617
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:46,090
fuck up your whole balance thing.

1618
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:46,271
Yeah,

1619
00:37:46,271 --> 00:37:46,760
exactly right.

1620
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:49,060
It's just a sticker called
bucket hanging off me.

1621
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:51,070
Alan Bro Bear Guy.

1622
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:55,740
He started off doing the regular
climbing and just decided this,

1623
00:37:55,750 --> 00:37:56,650
no money in this shit.

1624
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:57,341
Actually,

1625
00:37:57,341 --> 00:37:58,270
I think part of it was that,

1626
00:37:58,271 --> 00:37:58,810
um,

1627
00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:02,380
he had a couple of kind of terrible ground
falls where like he felt so alone and

1628
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:04,360
it got all messed up
like different things.

1629
00:38:04,770 --> 00:38:05,071
And so,

1630
00:38:05,071 --> 00:38:05,290
um,

1631
00:38:05,290 --> 00:38:08,060
I think he now has like a summer
restricted range of motion.

1632
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,550
I can't move his arms in certain ways.

1633
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:10,411
And so,

1634
00:38:10,411 --> 00:38:11,170
um,

1635
00:38:11,170 --> 00:38:11,381
so,

1636
00:38:11,381 --> 00:38:14,230
so long on rock is kind of out of the
question a little bit because rock

1637
00:38:14,231 --> 00:38:17,260
requires like real rock requires such
a diverse range of movements cause you

1638
00:38:17,261 --> 00:38:19,450
never know like where the holes are
going to be or what direction they'll be

1639
00:38:19,451 --> 00:38:20,230
facing.

1640
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:21,820
Where's buildings are extremely uniform.

1641
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:22,430
Right.

1642
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:22,720
But you know,

1643
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,570
say like with a building,

1644
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:23,691
you know,

1645
00:38:23,691 --> 00:38:24,610
he can look at it and be like,

1646
00:38:24,611 --> 00:38:24,821
okay,

1647
00:38:24,821 --> 00:38:26,620
I'm going to be like that
little clip you just saw.

1648
00:38:26,621 --> 00:38:30,040
He did that exact same movement over and
over for a thousand feet or however big

1649
00:38:30,041 --> 00:38:30,874
that building is.

1650
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:31,641
So Tito,

1651
00:38:31,641 --> 00:38:32,670
so this is like,

1652
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:35,290
I guess it's just another example,

1653
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,080
something

1654
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,180
where if you don't know how to do it,

1655
00:38:38,181 --> 00:38:39,014
it looks impossible.

1656
00:38:41,330 --> 00:38:42,680
I should know that by now.

1657
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:45,650
Is it every guest that
you have on like that,

1658
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:45,921
you know,

1659
00:38:45,921 --> 00:38:47,210
where you're like astrophysics?

1660
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:47,630
Yeah.

1661
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:48,291
Crazy.

1662
00:38:48,291 --> 00:38:48,621
Yeah.

1663
00:38:48,621 --> 00:38:51,950
Like actually it's real
boring study physics.

1664
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:54,230
Astrophysics is boring.

1665
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:55,071
That hasn't,

1666
00:38:55,071 --> 00:38:55,821
but I know what you're saying.

1667
00:38:55,821 --> 00:38:56,121
Yeah.

1668
00:38:56,121 --> 00:38:56,601
You know what I mean?

1669
00:38:56,601 --> 00:38:57,620
It becomes commonplace.

1670
00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:00,390
They didn't come from what you do
and then they should or something.

1671
00:39:00,391 --> 00:39:00,741
They're like,

1672
00:39:00,741 --> 00:39:01,100
yeah,

1673
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:01,970
punch people in the face.

1674
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:02,271
Well,

1675
00:39:02,271 --> 00:39:03,740
I don't really hit him that much.

1676
00:39:03,770 --> 00:39:05,440
Most of what I do is Jujitsu these days.

1677
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:06,800
So you throw them into a wall.

1678
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:07,870
It's the strangle him.

1679
00:39:08,450 --> 00:39:09,350
Why Mars and stuff.

1680
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:11,990
Have you ever climbed during a earthquake?

1681
00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:12,790
Like,

1682
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:14,600
or is that a fear of yours?

1683
00:39:14,601 --> 00:39:17,090
Like having like the big
earthquake while you're there?

1684
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:18,960
Fuck a fat one.

1685
00:39:18,961 --> 00:39:19,410
Yeah.

1686
00:39:19,410 --> 00:39:19,650
Yeah.

1687
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:22,350
But see a mountain driving
over a bridge and the

1688
00:39:23,930 --> 00:39:24,210
same,

1689
00:39:24,210 --> 00:39:24,510
yeah,

1690
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:27,360
but you were in a car
and it's like a movie.

1691
00:39:27,361 --> 00:39:30,330
The car might hit the water and then
you can open up a window and you can get

1692
00:39:30,331 --> 00:39:31,164
out.

1693
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,233
Yeah.

1694
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:33,593
I don't know.

1695
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:34,620
Um,

1696
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:35,453
but,

1697
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:36,471
but the,

1698
00:39:36,471 --> 00:39:38,250
the connection between the Lick,

1699
00:39:38,251 --> 00:39:39,960
looking at people doing martial arts,

1700
00:39:39,990 --> 00:39:40,130
it,

1701
00:39:40,130 --> 00:39:41,390
it totally makes sense to me that,

1702
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:42,090
you know what I mean?

1703
00:39:42,090 --> 00:39:45,240
Like I watch a video of an ICO master
or something like throwing people around

1704
00:39:45,241 --> 00:39:46,860
the word around the room.

1705
00:39:46,870 --> 00:39:47,730
And that was something son,

1706
00:39:47,731 --> 00:39:48,564
most of,

1707
00:39:48,930 --> 00:39:49,231
yeah,

1708
00:39:49,231 --> 00:39:50,190
most of that's horse shit.

1709
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:50,491
All right.

1710
00:39:50,491 --> 00:39:54,120
Well I can either read was read a martial
art that really works if the other

1711
00:39:54,121 --> 00:39:57,630
person doesn't know anything or if you
have no idea what this guy doing or if

1712
00:39:57,631 --> 00:39:58,740
you're cooperating.

1713
00:39:58,920 --> 00:39:59,950
And that's what a lot of it is.

1714
00:39:59,990 --> 00:40:04,710
The videos the guys running at you
and he's committing to a very specific

1715
00:40:04,711 --> 00:40:06,720
technique and you're
throwing them on the ground,

1716
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:10,620
but you never see that
applied in like a UFC match.

1717
00:40:10,650 --> 00:40:15,120
He very rarely you'll see some of
the principles of misdirection and

1718
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:18,540
manipulating bodies and like
throwing bottles with leverage,

1719
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,180
but the way you see it in
like in a kito demonstration.

1720
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:22,890
But Shit never happens in the real world.

1721
00:40:22,891 --> 00:40:23,724
It just doesn't,

1722
00:40:23,730 --> 00:40:24,020
it's,

1723
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:24,853
it's kind of,

1724
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,210
there's a lot of that leftover from,

1725
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:31,710
there was a time where martial arts had
like a great mysticism attached to it,

1726
00:40:32,010 --> 00:40:33,480
but because of the UFC,

1727
00:40:33,481 --> 00:40:35,190
because of mixed martial arts competition,

1728
00:40:35,191 --> 00:40:38,190
it's become much more pragmatic and now
they really understand what works and

1729
00:40:38,191 --> 00:40:38,970
what doesn't work.

1730
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:39,391
So I,

1731
00:40:39,391 --> 00:40:40,920
Kido is one of those martial arts.

1732
00:40:40,921 --> 00:40:43,530
It has some practical application,

1733
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:48,480
but as a lot of fuckery there's a lot
of shit that just doesn't work or apply

1734
00:40:48,490 --> 00:40:49,590
that mindset to climbing.

1735
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:50,853
I'm sure.

1736
00:40:50,870 --> 00:40:51,660
Sure.

1737
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:51,871
Yeah.

1738
00:40:51,871 --> 00:40:56,190
I have friends that watch like a
martial arts thing on television.

1739
00:40:56,191 --> 00:40:57,270
Like fuck that guy.

1740
00:40:57,271 --> 00:40:57,781
Just do that.

1741
00:40:57,781 --> 00:40:59,070
And like that's a wheel kick.

1742
00:40:59,071 --> 00:41:00,300
That's like standard technique,

1743
00:41:00,301 --> 00:41:00,800
you know,

1744
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:04,430
that's how you looking at this flag and
that guy is on those two buildings or

1745
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:05,280
those two sides.

1746
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:06,390
Like that's uniform.

1747
00:41:06,391 --> 00:41:07,470
That's a hanger that's,

1748
00:41:07,530 --> 00:41:09,530
he does nothing to do.

1749
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:11,820
Everyone's got their thing.

1750
00:41:11,821 --> 00:41:15,360
You know that some people don't have
their things so they should find their

1751
00:41:15,361 --> 00:41:15,571
thing.

1752
00:41:15,571 --> 00:41:16,151
They should knit,

1753
00:41:16,151 --> 00:41:16,410
you know,

1754
00:41:16,410 --> 00:41:17,430
they should start a garden.

1755
00:41:17,490 --> 00:41:18,810
Like everybody can do something.

1756
00:41:18,870 --> 00:41:20,250
Everybody should have a thing though.

1757
00:41:20,251 --> 00:41:21,630
I completely agree.

1758
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:23,760
I had a friend who was
getting divorced and uh,

1759
00:41:24,090 --> 00:41:24,570
but what,

1760
00:41:24,570 --> 00:41:25,860
that's one of the things he said.

1761
00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:26,641
He said,

1762
00:41:26,641 --> 00:41:26,880
uh,

1763
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:27,640
he goes to five,

1764
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:28,800
find another woman.

1765
00:41:28,801 --> 00:41:29,011
He goes,

1766
00:41:29,011 --> 00:41:32,040
I swear to God I'm going to find
someone who likes something.

1767
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:34,060
He goes anything fucking taller

1768
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:35,510
and actually said rock climbing,

1769
00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:37,940
fucking rock climbing.

1770
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:40,910
He was so mad cause he had did well he,

1771
00:41:40,970 --> 00:41:41,241
you know,

1772
00:41:41,241 --> 00:41:43,430
he married someone who
was a little bit vapid.

1773
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:48,440
It was a fascinating there you really
need something to get him out of bed and

1774
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:49,970
not just to get you out of bed though.

1775
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:52,160
Just to make it fun where
you gotta to be fired up,

1776
00:41:52,490 --> 00:41:52,790
you know,

1777
00:41:52,790 --> 00:41:54,830
to like to make like interesting.

1778
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:55,310
Yeah.

1779
00:41:55,310 --> 00:41:57,260
And it affects your health too.

1780
00:41:57,620 --> 00:41:58,371
It really does.

1781
00:41:58,371 --> 00:41:59,720
It affects how you feel.

1782
00:41:59,721 --> 00:42:00,320
It affects site.

1783
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:02,150
If you have something
you really love to do,

1784
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:05,990
if there's anything I could ever tell
anybody that's out there that's young,

1785
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:09,170
that's like got a lot of people that
are telling them to take a safe route.

1786
00:42:09,171 --> 00:42:11,960
Actually there are no young people
listening to this young people.

1787
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:12,691
I hope.

1788
00:42:12,691 --> 00:42:15,890
I hope there are like eight
to 14 is our [inaudible].

1789
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:17,690
We go for 12 year olds.

1790
00:42:17,691 --> 00:42:19,520
12 year olds are more malleable.

1791
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:21,200
That's fair.

1792
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:21,510
All right.

1793
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:21,920
Oh man,

1794
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:22,671
it's on the Internet.

1795
00:42:22,671 --> 00:42:24,890
I'm sure there's fucking
12 year olds listening.

1796
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:27,030
I get emails from 16
year olds all the time.

1797
00:42:27,050 --> 00:42:28,040
Like the curse with kids.

1798
00:42:28,041 --> 00:42:29,630
You know why it's just a word.

1799
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:31,470
Second year olds are old enough.

1800
00:42:31,630 --> 00:42:32,510
That's that sweet.

1801
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:33,650
I feel I feel bad.

1802
00:42:33,651 --> 00:42:34,150
A little kid,

1803
00:42:34,150 --> 00:42:36,590
but you shouldn't because they're going
to say it when they become adults.

1804
00:42:36,591 --> 00:42:37,371
It's crazy.

1805
00:42:37,371 --> 00:42:37,790
You should.

1806
00:42:37,790 --> 00:42:41,150
Everybody should say fuck
that way for a little bit.

1807
00:42:41,151 --> 00:42:41,660
You don't think?

1808
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:42,050
No.

1809
00:42:42,050 --> 00:42:44,150
I say keep using it,

1810
00:42:44,151 --> 00:42:46,130
but use it in moderation.

1811
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:46,971
No one to use it.

1812
00:42:46,971 --> 00:42:47,480
It's like,

1813
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:48,231
like comedians.

1814
00:42:48,231 --> 00:42:52,020
When comedians used the word fuck too
many times you overflow you route.

1815
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:53,690
It ruins the impact of the word,

1816
00:42:53,691 --> 00:42:56,120
but when you don't use it that
often and then you use it,

1817
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:57,313
boom,

1818
00:42:57,470 --> 00:42:58,303
it works.

1819
00:42:58,340 --> 00:43:00,740
My point is there's nothing
wrong with little kids saying,

1820
00:43:00,750 --> 00:43:01,310
fuck it's,

1821
00:43:01,310 --> 00:43:02,143
it's adorable.

1822
00:43:02,710 --> 00:43:04,130
Didn't we've watched that movie.

1823
00:43:04,131 --> 00:43:06,440
What the fuck was that
movie with Nicholas Cage?

1824
00:43:06,470 --> 00:43:10,240
The a kick ass kick ass little
girl calls over the cons.

1825
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:11,463
It's beautiful.

1826
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:13,190
There's nothing wrong with that man.

1827
00:43:13,191 --> 00:43:13,371
We're,

1828
00:43:13,371 --> 00:43:15,440
we're silly people with magic words,

1829
00:43:15,650 --> 00:43:17,480
but if there's anything that you can,

1830
00:43:17,990 --> 00:43:20,390
that young people can hear
that can benefit them,

1831
00:43:20,391 --> 00:43:24,200
the big one is do what you're drawn to.

1832
00:43:24,710 --> 00:43:25,970
Whatever you're drawn to.

1833
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:26,900
Go to that.

1834
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:31,880
Just find something you love to do
because your life will be different than

1835
00:43:31,881 --> 00:43:36,380
someone who just works because we could
all get by just working and have hobbies

1836
00:43:36,381 --> 00:43:36,891
and you know,

1837
00:43:36,891 --> 00:43:40,760
and have family and friends that keep
us entertained and have people at work

1838
00:43:40,761 --> 00:43:43,970
that we enjoy being around so
we can have a good time working.

1839
00:43:43,971 --> 00:43:47,150
I'm not saying you don't have a good
life if you're a person who works.

1840
00:43:47,330 --> 00:43:51,950
When I'm saying is if you have the
choice and you do when you're young,

1841
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:52,341
you do.

1842
00:43:52,341 --> 00:43:53,270
When you don't have commitments,

1843
00:43:53,271 --> 00:43:53,961
you don't have a mortgage,

1844
00:43:53,961 --> 00:43:54,794
you don't have a family.

1845
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:57,410
Go do what you fucking love.

1846
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:58,333
Go there,

1847
00:43:58,340 --> 00:43:59,180
go get,

1848
00:43:59,510 --> 00:44:02,660
find whatever it is because
you're a perfect example of that.

1849
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:05,780
What you do would make me shit
my pants every day of the week.

1850
00:44:05,781 --> 00:44:07,190
I have no desire.

1851
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:08,150
I don't,

1852
00:44:08,150 --> 00:44:10,460
I don't have her look at mountains.

1853
00:44:10,461 --> 00:44:10,671
I go,

1854
00:44:10,671 --> 00:44:11,211
fuck man,

1855
00:44:11,211 --> 00:44:12,290
I need to climb that shit.

1856
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:12,801
Never.

1857
00:44:12,801 --> 00:44:13,700
It's not in me.

1858
00:44:13,701 --> 00:44:14,360
It doesn't,

1859
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:15,470
it doesn't appeal to me.

1860
00:44:15,471 --> 00:44:16,720
I look over the edge of building.

1861
00:44:16,721 --> 00:44:16,970
It's like,

1862
00:44:16,970 --> 00:44:19,910
oh well when I fucking run away and hide,

1863
00:44:20,090 --> 00:44:21,650
I am so not into that.

1864
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:23,840
But I love the fact that you are,

1865
00:44:24,050 --> 00:44:24,381
you know,

1866
00:44:24,381 --> 00:44:28,550
I'd love the fact that people are so
different that it's whatever it is,

1867
00:44:28,551 --> 00:44:31,720
or ones and Zeros inside of your make.

1868
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:34,180
You look at a tree and
won a fucking climate.

1869
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:35,231
I don't know what that is,

1870
00:44:35,231 --> 00:44:36,190
but I think it's awesome.

1871
00:44:36,610 --> 00:44:36,881
You know,

1872
00:44:36,881 --> 00:44:37,391
it's a,

1873
00:44:37,391 --> 00:44:37,631
it's,

1874
00:44:37,631 --> 00:44:39,040
it's shocking and it's weird,

1875
00:44:39,041 --> 00:44:39,731
but it's awesome.

1876
00:44:39,731 --> 00:44:42,610
And it's a perfect example
of that principle in action.

1877
00:44:42,850 --> 00:44:44,380
You've always been drawn to climbing.

1878
00:44:44,530 --> 00:44:45,610
You climb and look at you.

1879
00:44:45,611 --> 00:44:46,444
You're happy bastard.

1880
00:44:46,570 --> 00:44:47,210
That's what I was saying,

1881
00:44:47,210 --> 00:44:49,100
that my family's always been
surprisingly supportive,

1882
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:49,490
you know,

1883
00:44:49,490 --> 00:44:52,240
because I think my mom sort of
values exactly what you're saying.

1884
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:52,900
And she's like,

1885
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:53,830
that's what he loves to do.

1886
00:44:53,831 --> 00:44:54,371
He's doing it.

1887
00:44:54,371 --> 00:44:55,530
He's working hard at it,

1888
00:44:55,550 --> 00:44:56,081
doing it well,

1889
00:44:56,081 --> 00:44:56,440
like,

1890
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:56,860
you know,

1891
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:57,910
can't do any better than none.

1892
00:44:58,060 --> 00:44:59,020
You got a cool mom.

1893
00:44:59,040 --> 00:44:59,410
That's,

1894
00:44:59,410 --> 00:45:00,700
if everybody had a mom like that,

1895
00:45:00,730 --> 00:45:02,020
we would be a better world.

1896
00:45:02,290 --> 00:45:02,900
Yeah.

1897
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:03,900
Do you have any fears?

1898
00:45:03,901 --> 00:45:05,000
Like are you scared of Shit Shits?

1899
00:45:05,010 --> 00:45:05,960
Is there anything like that?

1900
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:10,071
Yeah,

1901
00:45:10,071 --> 00:45:10,490
no,

1902
00:45:10,490 --> 00:45:10,851
nothing.

1903
00:45:10,851 --> 00:45:11,840
Nothing crazy.

1904
00:45:11,841 --> 00:45:12,230
You know,

1905
00:45:12,230 --> 00:45:15,500
my friend's girlfriend has
a Arachnophobia like legit,

1906
00:45:15,530 --> 00:45:17,510
like if you say spider around her,

1907
00:45:17,511 --> 00:45:18,830
just say the word spider.

1908
00:45:18,950 --> 00:45:20,540
Her throat starts to close up.

1909
00:45:20,610 --> 00:45:20,961
Really?

1910
00:45:20,961 --> 00:45:21,800
She can't talk.

1911
00:45:22,550 --> 00:45:23,390
She freaks out.

1912
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:25,460
You know who it is.

1913
00:45:25,610 --> 00:45:26,660
She was there the other day,

1914
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:27,520
girl.

1915
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:27,951
Oh,

1916
00:45:27,951 --> 00:45:29,380
we're watching spider.

1917
00:45:29,650 --> 00:45:29,891
Yeah.

1918
00:45:29,891 --> 00:45:30,724
You remember that?

1919
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:35,460
You say the word spider around her who
are her throat starts to close La for no

1920
00:45:35,461 --> 00:45:35,851
reason.

1921
00:45:35,851 --> 00:45:36,360
Kind of weird.

1922
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:36,840
Yeah.

1923
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:37,531
And she has no idea.

1924
00:45:37,531 --> 00:45:39,330
She has no life experience with a spider.

1925
00:45:39,331 --> 00:45:42,950
There's never been any limitations and
those spite them all stay shoes and

1926
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:44,180
molested by a tarantula.

1927
00:45:44,190 --> 00:45:45,023
She was a baby,

1928
00:45:45,170 --> 00:45:45,780
you know?

1929
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:48,030
I mean would it probably was,

1930
00:45:48,090 --> 00:45:51,600
was I bet someone in
her chain of ancestry,

1931
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:55,560
this is just totally
unscientific theory by me.

1932
00:45:55,620 --> 00:45:56,580
Like a daddy long leg.

1933
00:45:56,610 --> 00:46:00,030
I have this idea of genetic
memory and it's a shit,

1934
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:00,301
you know,

1935
00:46:00,301 --> 00:46:02,520
I'm not a scientist so I
shouldn't even be talking here,

1936
00:46:02,521 --> 00:46:05,460
but I'm gonna say it anyway
cause it's just a thought.

1937
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:08,820
The idea is that when people
have like reincarnations,

1938
00:46:08,850 --> 00:46:09,240
you know,

1939
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:09,481
when,

1940
00:46:09,481 --> 00:46:09,691
you know,

1941
00:46:09,691 --> 00:46:10,530
people say like,

1942
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:11,181
Oh,

1943
00:46:11,181 --> 00:46:11,321
uh,

1944
00:46:11,321 --> 00:46:12,150
I'm uh,

1945
00:46:12,150 --> 00:46:12,630
uh,

1946
00:46:12,630 --> 00:46:12,931
you know,

1947
00:46:12,931 --> 00:46:16,860
a soldier that lived in the 16 hundreds
and I've been reincarnated and you know,

1948
00:46:16,861 --> 00:46:20,490
I can tell you about the boat that I was
on that got sunk by the British troop.

1949
00:46:20,660 --> 00:46:20,880
You know,

1950
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:21,121
when,

1951
00:46:21,121 --> 00:46:22,410
when people have those stories,

1952
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:26,310
I really wonder whether or not sperm,

1953
00:46:26,430 --> 00:46:27,690
whether or not genetics,

1954
00:46:27,691 --> 00:46:28,381
whether or not you're,

1955
00:46:28,381 --> 00:46:29,100
you're a bar.

1956
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:29,781
Like when,

1957
00:46:29,781 --> 00:46:32,160
when a person makes another person,

1958
00:46:32,430 --> 00:46:35,280
how much information is
actually getting to that kid.

1959
00:46:35,281 --> 00:46:38,760
It might be like all a lot
more than we have access to.

1960
00:46:38,970 --> 00:46:43,970
And it might very well be that
when you are a person who has,

1961
00:46:44,341 --> 00:46:44,520
you know,

1962
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:48,900
who many macs of thousands
of traceable generations,

1963
00:46:49,110 --> 00:46:52,500
that all of that information of all
those people's lives might be somehow

1964
00:46:52,510 --> 00:46:54,120
another encoded in our DNA.

1965
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:56,070
So in her past,

1966
00:46:56,071 --> 00:46:57,060
somewhere on the,

1967
00:46:57,140 --> 00:46:58,770
along that chain of life,

1968
00:46:58,890 --> 00:47:03,270
someone had a fucking horrific experience
with a spider and maybe almost died

1969
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:04,201
and shit.

1970
00:47:04,201 --> 00:47:04,651
Their pants,

1971
00:47:04,651 --> 00:47:09,090
every time they see spiders
and some hundred that wacky
gene think finds its way

1972
00:47:09,091 --> 00:47:11,340
into her little personality toolbox.

1973
00:47:11,670 --> 00:47:14,250
And now you say spider around
her and her throat closes shut.

1974
00:47:14,550 --> 00:47:16,590
I mean this makes sense to me.

1975
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:19,580
I mean obviously I know
nothing about genetics.

1976
00:47:21,110 --> 00:47:22,490
Does that mean you can
get raped and feel that?

1977
00:47:22,970 --> 00:47:24,170
But that will go away,

1978
00:47:24,171 --> 00:47:24,930
you know?

1979
00:47:24,930 --> 00:47:25,150
Okay.

1980
00:47:25,150 --> 00:47:25,391
Where,

1981
00:47:25,391 --> 00:47:26,550
where are the instincts come from?

1982
00:47:26,551 --> 00:47:26,970
Them.

1983
00:47:26,970 --> 00:47:27,331
Why?

1984
00:47:27,331 --> 00:47:28,440
Why do we have instincts?

1985
00:47:28,441 --> 00:47:29,274
Why do little,

1986
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:32,250
why are they afraid of monsters
if they live in cities?

1987
00:47:32,490 --> 00:47:34,410
Why is everybody afraid
of things with big teeth?

1988
00:47:34,411 --> 00:47:35,130
It's in the dark.

1989
00:47:35,130 --> 00:47:35,880
I'll tell you why.

1990
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:38,730
Because at one point in time we
used to be hunted by leopards.

1991
00:47:38,910 --> 00:47:39,181
Okay.

1992
00:47:39,181 --> 00:47:40,760
We would go out of our tents at night,

1993
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:41,940
we'd get fucked up,

1994
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:42,361
you know,

1995
00:47:42,361 --> 00:47:45,960
cause we were a little monkey people
and that shit is still in our head.

1996
00:47:45,961 --> 00:47:48,270
We're still terrified of
monsters in the night.

1997
00:47:48,510 --> 00:47:50,070
And I think that's a genetic thing.

1998
00:47:50,071 --> 00:47:54,750
I think there's certain instincts that
humans have that are relayed through

1999
00:47:54,751 --> 00:47:57,630
generation after generation of
experience after experience.

2000
00:47:57,810 --> 00:48:00,260
It only makes sense that
somehow or another that code,

2001
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:03,720
these new DNA is different
than personal experience.

2002
00:48:04,010 --> 00:48:04,170
Well,

2003
00:48:04,170 --> 00:48:06,000
I think it's not because memes,

2004
00:48:06,030 --> 00:48:08,730
they know that racism can be
transferred through genetics.

2005
00:48:09,030 --> 00:48:09,450
They,

2006
00:48:09,450 --> 00:48:13,950
there's direct evidence that people
who do not have exposure to racism,

2007
00:48:14,130 --> 00:48:18,270
but their parents were racist and they
were adopted or more inclined to become

2008
00:48:18,271 --> 00:48:20,040
racist or have racist ideology,

2009
00:48:20,260 --> 00:48:21,093
et Cetera.

2010
00:48:21,290 --> 00:48:22,890
So not only did some,

2011
00:48:22,910 --> 00:48:26,310
some study on memes where
they had a identical twins,

2012
00:48:26,970 --> 00:48:28,850
I watched some documentary on the,

2013
00:48:28,851 --> 00:48:29,061
the,

2014
00:48:29,061 --> 00:48:32,130
the concept of cultural genes basically.

2015
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:32,581
It's not,

2016
00:48:32,581 --> 00:48:34,500
not just its ideas period.

2017
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:35,311
And the,

2018
00:48:35,311 --> 00:48:35,581
the,

2019
00:48:35,581 --> 00:48:35,761
the,

2020
00:48:35,761 --> 00:48:40,761
the concept is that there's a certain
amount of things that you learn in life

2021
00:48:40,890 --> 00:48:42,270
that's related to your children.

2022
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:46,050
And that's one of the reasons why
children of musical people become very

2023
00:48:46,051 --> 00:48:46,681
musical.

2024
00:48:46,681 --> 00:48:47,011
It's like,

2025
00:48:47,011 --> 00:48:50,790
it's very common that people
have children and their children,

2026
00:48:50,940 --> 00:48:52,920
not just because it's the
environment they grow up in,

2027
00:48:52,921 --> 00:48:57,390
but they show like an instant proclivity
towards some sort of a thing that you

2028
00:48:57,420 --> 00:49:01,200
were very good at that wouldn't have
to do with your physical genetics.

2029
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:03,020
As we think of it as firms as you know,

2030
00:49:03,030 --> 00:49:04,170
body type and you know,

2031
00:49:04,171 --> 00:49:05,760
athleticism and things along those lines,

2032
00:49:05,910 --> 00:49:08,550
which we've already assumed
transfer on and we know transfer on.

2033
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:09,713
But I think there's,

2034
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:13,800
there's also life experience and
mental things that transfer on her.

2035
00:49:14,270 --> 00:49:14,540
You know,

2036
00:49:14,540 --> 00:49:17,280
it doesn't mean that you're going to
be racist because your dad was racist

2037
00:49:17,281 --> 00:49:21,060
because we know that's not the case with
people that grew up with a racist dad.

2038
00:49:21,330 --> 00:49:21,740
You know,

2039
00:49:21,740 --> 00:49:26,740
I have a friend whose dad was dad just
can't not be racist no matter what it is

2040
00:49:27,151 --> 00:49:27,781
in the news.

2041
00:49:27,781 --> 00:49:30,450
It means like Archie bunker type dude.

2042
00:49:30,510 --> 00:49:31,800
You know what's kind of funny,

2043
00:49:31,830 --> 00:49:33,750
but he's just so racist.

2044
00:49:33,930 --> 00:49:34,763
My friend,

2045
00:49:34,770 --> 00:49:36,120
like as liberal as they come,

2046
00:49:36,190 --> 00:49:40,410
it just has no inclination towards any
sort of judgment of anybody and it's

2047
00:49:40,411 --> 00:49:44,430
probably just his response to
growing up with this idiot.

2048
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:44,821
You know,

2049
00:49:44,821 --> 00:49:46,530
these sort of figured out how dumb it is.

2050
00:49:47,090 --> 00:49:47,370
You know,

2051
00:49:47,370 --> 00:49:48,360
he's rebounded from it,

2052
00:49:48,361 --> 00:49:49,800
which is pretty common with people.

2053
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:54,360
But if he hadn't been around that guy
and been in different environments,

2054
00:49:54,361 --> 00:49:56,670
I mean who knows how much
of it is nature and nurture.

2055
00:49:56,820 --> 00:50:01,740
But the concept is that some of it is
being transmitted through information,

2056
00:50:03,390 --> 00:50:04,500
through genetics.

2057
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:05,513
I think it makes sense.

2058
00:50:06,330 --> 00:50:10,410
So this poor bitch some like somebody
got checked by a spider and our past,

2059
00:50:12,810 --> 00:50:14,970
maybe I might be right.

2060
00:50:15,250 --> 00:50:16,083
It makes sense.

2061
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:18,653
What's so funny?

2062
00:50:18,930 --> 00:50:19,830
So like her great,

2063
00:50:19,831 --> 00:50:20,101
great,

2064
00:50:20,101 --> 00:50:21,120
great grandmother was like,

2065
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:24,060
Hi once in a little spider biters.

2066
00:50:24,061 --> 00:50:24,241
You're like,

2067
00:50:24,241 --> 00:50:24,660
oh,

2068
00:50:24,660 --> 00:50:24,790
oh

2069
00:50:24,790 --> 00:50:29,390
I know a girl who got bit by a fucking
Brown Breck loose in her pussy.

2070
00:50:29,510 --> 00:50:31,460
Oh it was in her underwear.

2071
00:50:31,461 --> 00:50:32,600
She pulled her underwear.

2072
00:50:32,630 --> 00:50:34,070
I didn't know the spiders in there.

2073
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:35,210
There's spider bit.

2074
00:50:35,211 --> 00:50:40,211
Her fucking pussy and a brown recluse
is the most horrific spider in North

2075
00:50:40,791 --> 00:50:41,330
America.

2076
00:50:41,330 --> 00:50:42,020
In fact,

2077
00:50:42,020 --> 00:50:45,260
it doesn't just doesn't poison you.

2078
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:48,770
It literally turns your flesh dead flesh.

2079
00:50:48,771 --> 00:50:49,604
Yeah.

2080
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:50,593
What happened to her?

2081
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:50,880
She,

2082
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:51,860
her pussy died.

2083
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:52,840
Ah,

2084
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:53,870
can you imagine this?

2085
00:50:53,871 --> 00:50:54,710
You still have a pussy.

2086
00:50:55,100 --> 00:50:55,933
Is it just a whole,

2087
00:50:56,060 --> 00:50:57,050
it's dead.

2088
00:50:57,080 --> 00:50:57,913
It died.

2089
00:50:59,740 --> 00:51:01,000
Did a really I pussy.

2090
00:51:01,730 --> 00:51:02,563
That's tragic.

2091
00:51:05,780 --> 00:51:07,760
I don't know the extent of the damage,

2092
00:51:07,761 --> 00:51:10,620
but I have never seen a brown
recluse bite that didn't do so.

2093
00:51:12,350 --> 00:51:14,510
I don't know how quickly
she got to the doctor.

2094
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:19,100
But essentially the toxins kills all the
flesh around it to the point where you

2095
00:51:19,101 --> 00:51:20,120
have to carve it out.

2096
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:21,500
It's like a big dead holds.

2097
00:51:21,670 --> 00:51:22,380
We discussed her.

2098
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:22,620
Yeah.

2099
00:51:22,620 --> 00:51:23,960
So she has a hole in her whole,

2100
00:51:24,020 --> 00:51:24,620
Oh,

2101
00:51:24,620 --> 00:51:26,180
it's probably don't even say it.

2102
00:51:26,390 --> 00:51:27,770
Don't say you son of a bitch.

2103
00:51:28,820 --> 00:51:29,840
They um,

2104
00:51:30,290 --> 00:51:31,610
they did do something.

2105
00:51:31,660 --> 00:51:32,050
Um,

2106
00:51:32,050 --> 00:51:32,491
with the,

2107
00:51:32,491 --> 00:51:32,661
Oh,

2108
00:51:32,661 --> 00:51:33,650
Jeremy Horn,

2109
00:51:33,830 --> 00:51:34,970
one of the MMA fighters.

2110
00:51:35,210 --> 00:51:35,781
He had a,

2111
00:51:35,781 --> 00:51:36,170
um,

2112
00:51:36,170 --> 00:51:40,130
a brown recluse sting on
his leg and he had like,

2113
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:43,160
it was like a golf ball holes crazy.

2114
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:46,970
He had like this giant hole that had
just eaten through his leg and he had to

2115
00:51:46,971 --> 00:51:50,510
like keep gauze in it and everything
that's happened to a lot of guys.

2116
00:51:51,170 --> 00:51:53,750
These fucking brown reckless
is the climb in your shoes,

2117
00:51:53,780 --> 00:51:54,081
you know,

2118
00:51:54,081 --> 00:51:57,560
and then you just put your shoe on and
it'll sting you and your foot's jacked.

2119
00:51:57,620 --> 00:51:59,690
Their port of Scorpion out
of my shoe and you send me,

2120
00:51:59,860 --> 00:52:00,770
did you boy,

2121
00:52:01,550 --> 00:52:02,540
he didn't know it was in there.

2122
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:03,380
No,

2123
00:52:03,380 --> 00:52:04,100
I mean,

2124
00:52:04,100 --> 00:52:04,281
oh,

2125
00:52:04,281 --> 00:52:05,510
you miss it before you put your shoe on.

2126
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:09,150
I was going to put my shoe on
and poured out of Scorpion.

2127
00:52:09,151 --> 00:52:09,500
It was like,

2128
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:10,190
Huh?

2129
00:52:10,190 --> 00:52:11,080
Wow.

2130
00:52:12,010 --> 00:52:12,400
Yeah.

2131
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:12,651
How,

2132
00:52:12,651 --> 00:52:14,060
how poisonous or scorpions,

2133
00:52:14,130 --> 00:52:17,060
there's different models around
rectories probably would have been fine.

2134
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:17,541
Some of them,

2135
00:52:17,541 --> 00:52:20,090
some of them fuck you up and
some of them just hurt real bad.

2136
00:52:20,091 --> 00:52:20,331
Right?

2137
00:52:20,331 --> 00:52:20,811
Like a beast.

2138
00:52:20,811 --> 00:52:22,820
And I've heard the little
ones are like real poisonous,

2139
00:52:22,821 --> 00:52:23,780
but I think it's just painful.

2140
00:52:23,781 --> 00:52:24,800
It's not like you're going to die.

2141
00:52:25,580 --> 00:52:26,220
Okay.

2142
00:52:26,220 --> 00:52:26,870
But we had,

2143
00:52:26,870 --> 00:52:29,450
we used them on fear factor
of we use the big giant ones,

2144
00:52:29,690 --> 00:52:30,740
which are really not that bad,

2145
00:52:30,860 --> 00:52:31,880
which I think aren't as bad.

2146
00:52:31,910 --> 00:52:32,211
Yeah.

2147
00:52:32,211 --> 00:52:32,930
It's kind of crazy.

2148
00:52:32,930 --> 00:52:33,731
But they fuck you up.

2149
00:52:33,731 --> 00:52:34,564
It's counterintuitive.

2150
00:52:34,820 --> 00:52:35,150
Yeah.

2151
00:52:35,150 --> 00:52:36,020
They look horrific.

2152
00:52:36,021 --> 00:52:37,980
Those big black here,

2153
00:52:38,210 --> 00:52:39,200
it looks so evil,

2154
00:52:39,250 --> 00:52:40,820
but just intimidating.

2155
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:42,620
What is fear factor?

2156
00:52:42,621 --> 00:52:43,191
Fear factor.

2157
00:52:43,191 --> 00:52:43,670
Factor.

2158
00:52:43,670 --> 00:52:44,300
Yeah.

2159
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:44,890
You were the,

2160
00:52:44,890 --> 00:52:45,650
what did you do with that?

2161
00:52:45,650 --> 00:52:46,750
You're the host or something as the host.

2162
00:52:47,690 --> 00:52:48,380
What does that mean?

2163
00:52:48,380 --> 00:52:50,450
You just told people that
are going to get messed up by

2164
00:52:51,950 --> 00:52:52,783
like,

2165
00:52:52,910 --> 00:52:55,010
do you spend all your time
climbing trees and shit?

2166
00:52:55,150 --> 00:52:56,780
We didn't never have like a TV and stuff,

2167
00:52:56,781 --> 00:52:57,000
you know,

2168
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:57,681
he's one of those things.

2169
00:52:57,681 --> 00:52:58,501
I like heard of it.

2170
00:52:58,501 --> 00:52:59,420
I've never had a teacher.

2171
00:52:59,580 --> 00:53:02,540
We had a TV but it was like in my parents'
room and we damn cable and we didn't,

2172
00:53:02,541 --> 00:53:03,140
you know,

2173
00:53:03,140 --> 00:53:03,860
I don't know.

2174
00:53:03,860 --> 00:53:04,880
I didn't see that much TV.

2175
00:53:05,030 --> 00:53:05,600
Wow.

2176
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:06,020
Um,

2177
00:53:06,020 --> 00:53:08,730
fear factor was a game show and it was um,

2178
00:53:08,830 --> 00:53:09,663
people got like torture.

2179
00:53:09,990 --> 00:53:10,550
No,

2180
00:53:10,550 --> 00:53:12,470
they had to do things that
were difficult to like,

2181
00:53:12,471 --> 00:53:15,530
sometimes they would have
to cars per building.

2182
00:53:15,830 --> 00:53:19,050
Sometimes they would get stung by a
scorpion so that if you want bugs or

2183
00:53:19,051 --> 00:53:21,560
drinking or they can say no for real,

2184
00:53:21,561 --> 00:53:23,210
like bull semen or like red boy you mean?

2185
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:23,990
Yeah.

2186
00:53:23,990 --> 00:53:26,310
Red Bull is no twice and it was donkey.

2187
00:53:26,890 --> 00:53:27,271
Oh yeah,

2188
00:53:27,271 --> 00:53:28,400
they had a drink waiting for Krill.

2189
00:53:28,490 --> 00:53:28,660
Yeah.

2190
00:53:28,660 --> 00:53:29,010
Yeah.

2191
00:53:29,010 --> 00:53:31,790
That's what he got the show
canceled that got the show cancel.

2192
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:33,540
That's where they drew the line.

2193
00:53:33,860 --> 00:53:34,280
I know.

2194
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:35,040
Shit.

2195
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:36,210
Capital letter e,

2196
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:37,500
capital n,

2197
00:53:37,501 --> 00:53:38,160
u f.

2198
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:39,540
F.

2199
00:53:39,540 --> 00:53:39,540
E.

2200
00:53:39,540 --> 00:53:40,650
Nef drink.

2201
00:53:40,860 --> 00:53:45,860
Would you drink a pitcher of donkey come
for the chance to win $50,000 not for

2202
00:53:46,501 --> 00:53:47,334
the chores.

2203
00:53:49,350 --> 00:53:50,640
You were definitely getting 50 grand.

2204
00:53:50,641 --> 00:53:51,660
You would do it maybe.

2205
00:53:51,661 --> 00:53:51,991
I mean,

2206
00:53:51,991 --> 00:53:52,210
yeah,

2207
00:53:52,210 --> 00:53:53,370
maybe it's not that big a deal.

2208
00:53:54,510 --> 00:53:55,830
I never understood about those shows.

2209
00:53:55,831 --> 00:53:57,390
Is that like if you had to

2210
00:53:57,430 --> 00:53:58,241
do any of those things,

2211
00:53:58,241 --> 00:53:59,320
it can't be that bad to do,

2212
00:53:59,650 --> 00:54:01,180
but if you're just doing
it for shits and giggles,

2213
00:54:01,181 --> 00:54:03,940
like why would you ever just let
yourself get stung by Scorpions for fun?

2214
00:54:03,941 --> 00:54:04,440
You know,

2215
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:07,690
this was warming curdled like
there was a top layer was,

2216
00:54:08,750 --> 00:54:09,000
no,

2217
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:09,833
that was it.

2218
00:54:10,350 --> 00:54:11,183
Yeah,

2219
00:54:11,380 --> 00:54:11,951
it was a,

2220
00:54:11,951 --> 00:54:14,930
it actually was everything
had to be a sanitizer.

2221
00:54:15,100 --> 00:54:15,371
Yeah.

2222
00:54:15,371 --> 00:54:17,790
Temperature controlled to
make sure it didn't curve.

2223
00:54:18,850 --> 00:54:19,960
They show Tim Harden up.

2224
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:23,770
Was there a yellow oil on the top of it
that this kind of like sat there in the

2225
00:54:23,771 --> 00:54:24,860
middle oil?

2226
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:26,920
Like it seems pretty
what's wrong with you?

2227
00:54:26,940 --> 00:54:30,910
Calm your comes broken too
much Starbucks or whatever.

2228
00:54:31,010 --> 00:54:31,940
Yeah.

2229
00:54:32,210 --> 00:54:33,520
Mycotoxins pool.

2230
00:54:33,790 --> 00:54:37,830
I bet if you took a syringe and stuck it
in that yellow stuff and pulled it out

2231
00:54:37,831 --> 00:54:38,381
to be pure,

2232
00:54:38,381 --> 00:54:39,850
mycotoxins were DMT.

2233
00:54:39,851 --> 00:54:40,660
That's your con.

2234
00:54:40,660 --> 00:54:42,760
It's just all pure pure toxin.

2235
00:54:43,090 --> 00:54:43,570
Can you get,

2236
00:54:43,570 --> 00:54:45,790
can you extract TMT from com?

2237
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:47,351
Um,

2238
00:54:47,351 --> 00:54:47,800
I dunno.

2239
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:51,550
I don't know what the exact content to
come on your extra talkative today with

2240
00:54:51,551 --> 00:54:52,384
dumb shit.

2241
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:53,950
This is something
happening over the weekend.

2242
00:54:53,951 --> 00:54:54,784
Did you hit your head?

2243
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:55,270
Well,

2244
00:54:55,270 --> 00:54:56,260
you can extract it from any,

2245
00:54:56,261 --> 00:54:57,094
did you hit your head?

2246
00:54:57,130 --> 00:54:57,311
No.

2247
00:54:57,311 --> 00:54:58,930
You could distract from humans and plants.

2248
00:54:59,330 --> 00:55:00,540
Come see comments.

2249
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:02,830
Can you get brain cells from come?

2250
00:55:02,831 --> 00:55:03,101
No,

2251
00:55:03,101 --> 00:55:03,934
you can't.

2252
00:55:04,510 --> 00:55:08,440
Calm can make a brain cell by combining
with a woman's ag and making a baby.

2253
00:55:08,620 --> 00:55:10,030
But you don't get brain
cells out of comedy.

2254
00:55:10,031 --> 00:55:10,864
Silly Bitch.

2255
00:55:10,950 --> 00:55:11,783
Hmm?

2256
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:14,580
Do you get pretty standard?

2257
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:16,180
This is the podcast that
people listen to you.

2258
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:17,900
You understand that?

2259
00:55:17,901 --> 00:55:18,890
Are you aware that concept?

2260
00:55:19,010 --> 00:55:20,660
How do you extract the empty from Creston?

2261
00:55:21,290 --> 00:55:21,591
Okay,

2262
00:55:21,591 --> 00:55:22,424
stop.

2263
00:55:22,610 --> 00:55:23,480
This is too dumb.

2264
00:55:23,710 --> 00:55:24,543
It's too dumb.

2265
00:55:25,020 --> 00:55:25,853
Can't do this.

2266
00:55:26,780 --> 00:55:27,920
See what I have to deal with every day.

2267
00:55:28,130 --> 00:55:28,551
You know what?

2268
00:55:28,551 --> 00:55:30,410
That's a kid who grows
up with nothing but TV.

2269
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:31,273
No parents,

2270
00:55:31,490 --> 00:55:34,040
they put them in front of the fucking
teeth and they never answered a question

2271
00:55:34,041 --> 00:55:36,770
once they broke him.

2272
00:55:37,130 --> 00:55:37,963
Hello.

2273
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:39,230
Tragedy,

2274
00:55:39,230 --> 00:55:41,690
tragedy for you because you
never been on the show before.

2275
00:55:41,691 --> 00:55:42,800
You didn't know what you're expecting.

2276
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:46,350
Guy Thought I was going to come on
here and some regular 60 minutes tape

2277
00:55:46,910 --> 00:55:49,250
respecting 60 minutes that
are super professionals

2278
00:55:51,350 --> 00:55:52,340
having 60 minutes.

2279
00:55:52,341 --> 00:55:53,174
Find out about you.

2280
00:55:53,610 --> 00:55:53,920
Uh,

2281
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:57,430
the producer was like an amateur
climber and he just Kinda Kinda into it.

2282
00:55:57,700 --> 00:55:58,091
Oh Wow.

2283
00:55:58,091 --> 00:55:59,170
So it was his idea.

2284
00:55:59,590 --> 00:55:59,980
Yeah.

2285
00:55:59,980 --> 00:56:01,570
And actually you had to pitch
it a bunch of times too.

2286
00:56:01,571 --> 00:56:01,871
He said,

2287
00:56:01,871 --> 00:56:02,704
cause uh,

2288
00:56:02,740 --> 00:56:02,981
you know,

2289
00:56:02,981 --> 00:56:03,910
he pitched it and they were like,

2290
00:56:03,911 --> 00:56:04,000
well,

2291
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,100
that sounds retarded and sorry,

2292
00:56:06,130 --> 00:56:06,701
pitched again.

2293
00:56:06,701 --> 00:56:07,300
And they're like,

2294
00:56:07,300 --> 00:56:07,660
no,

2295
00:56:07,660 --> 00:56:07,841
like,

2296
00:56:07,841 --> 00:56:08,740
who cares about climbing?

2297
00:56:08,741 --> 00:56:08,981
You know?

2298
00:56:08,981 --> 00:56:10,000
And then he said that finally he,

2299
00:56:10,001 --> 00:56:10,150
uh,

2300
00:56:10,150 --> 00:56:12,880
he cut himself his own little highlight
reel type deal from stuff off the

2301
00:56:12,881 --> 00:56:13,714
Internet and whatever.

2302
00:56:14,020 --> 00:56:14,441
And um,

2303
00:56:14,441 --> 00:56:15,880
and then showed it to his boss is like,

2304
00:56:15,910 --> 00:56:16,211
look,

2305
00:56:16,211 --> 00:56:16,841
it's this.

2306
00:56:16,841 --> 00:56:17,350
And they were like,

2307
00:56:17,350 --> 00:56:17,711
Oh yeah,

2308
00:56:17,711 --> 00:56:18,544
let's do that.

2309
00:56:18,690 --> 00:56:19,421
Visually it's,

2310
00:56:19,421 --> 00:56:20,650
so that's the thing.

2311
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:21,460
That's the thing.

2312
00:56:21,460 --> 00:56:22,293
But if you just,

2313
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:23,620
if you just tell though,

2314
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:26,770
there's this kid that basically
homeless that rock climbs a lot,

2315
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:27,281
you know,

2316
00:56:27,281 --> 00:56:27,611
they're like,

2317
00:56:27,611 --> 00:56:28,480
that sounds stupid,

2318
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:28,900
you know.

2319
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:30,130
How did you feed yourself when,

2320
00:56:30,131 --> 00:56:31,480
before the 60 minutes thing?

2321
00:56:31,540 --> 00:56:32,211
Before you answer Paul.

2322
00:56:32,211 --> 00:56:32,440
I mean,

2323
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:33,880
I had sponsored for 60 minutes.

2324
00:56:34,100 --> 00:56:36,550
It actually 60 minutes and even
changed my whole sponsorship scene.

2325
00:56:36,551 --> 00:56:37,840
I already had all the climate stuff.

2326
00:56:38,070 --> 00:56:38,331
Yeah.

2327
00:56:38,331 --> 00:56:39,610
Because you know,

2328
00:56:39,611 --> 00:56:42,100
the 60 minutes just catapulted
me into like the mainstream.

2329
00:56:42,101 --> 00:56:42,461
But I mean,

2330
00:56:42,461 --> 00:56:42,721
I've,

2331
00:56:42,721 --> 00:56:45,250
I've been a pretty good climate
for like years before that,

2332
00:56:45,251 --> 00:56:45,610
you know?

2333
00:56:45,610 --> 00:56:48,340
So how did people find out
about you before they just,

2334
00:56:48,370 --> 00:56:49,720
you just start climbing,

2335
00:56:49,721 --> 00:56:50,201
word of mouth,

2336
00:56:50,201 --> 00:56:50,561
whatever,

2337
00:56:50,561 --> 00:56:51,400
like climbing magazines.

2338
00:56:51,401 --> 00:56:52,390
It's such a small community.

2339
00:56:52,391 --> 00:56:52,481
Yeah,

2340
00:56:52,481 --> 00:56:53,500
it's a fairly small community.

2341
00:56:53,820 --> 00:56:55,570
What were you doing
for a living back then?

2342
00:56:56,260 --> 00:56:56,561
Well,

2343
00:56:56,561 --> 00:56:58,000
so for a couple of years,

2344
00:56:58,010 --> 00:56:58,843
um,

2345
00:56:59,150 --> 00:57:02,290
so I dropped out of college after
one year I was going to UC Berkeley.

2346
00:57:02,291 --> 00:57:03,124
Do Engineering.

2347
00:57:03,230 --> 00:57:04,570
There's no climbing in this room.

2348
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:05,070
Yeah.

2349
00:57:05,070 --> 00:57:05,850
I'm like,

2350
00:57:05,850 --> 00:57:06,121
yeah,

2351
00:57:06,121 --> 00:57:06,954
get me out of here.

2352
00:57:06,980 --> 00:57:07,330
I was like,

2353
00:57:07,330 --> 00:57:08,110
this is kind of,

2354
00:57:08,110 --> 00:57:10,320
I wasn't super fired up on
it for engineering would,

2355
00:57:10,321 --> 00:57:10,911
what was the,

2356
00:57:10,911 --> 00:57:11,950
the idea that was,

2357
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:12,541
I don't know,

2358
00:57:12,541 --> 00:57:13,600
it was going to do civil engineering,

2359
00:57:13,601 --> 00:57:15,130
like build big structures or something.

2360
00:57:15,130 --> 00:57:15,963
I don't know.

2361
00:57:15,970 --> 00:57:17,440
I wasn't like super
excited about it though.

2362
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:18,341
And then,

2363
00:57:18,341 --> 00:57:18,511
uh,

2364
00:57:18,511 --> 00:57:21,430
and then I kind of stopped and then I
went climbing for a while and so for the,

2365
00:57:21,580 --> 00:57:24,160
like I spent a couple of years just kind
of road trip and in climbing and then I

2366
00:57:24,161 --> 00:57:26,200
had sponsors and I did it more,

2367
00:57:26,630 --> 00:57:26,920
you know,

2368
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:27,753
becoming more and more.

2369
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:29,590
When you first left college,

2370
00:57:30,250 --> 00:57:30,941
what did you do?

2371
00:57:30,941 --> 00:57:33,760
Did you get part time jobs
and just climb everywhere?

2372
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:34,713
Ads?

2373
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:34,991
Well,

2374
00:57:34,991 --> 00:57:37,060
so it's slightly more complicated,

2375
00:57:37,061 --> 00:57:37,180
but,

2376
00:57:37,180 --> 00:57:37,361
so,

2377
00:57:37,361 --> 00:57:38,194
um,

2378
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:42,280
my dad died like the summer
before I stopped going to college.

2379
00:57:42,790 --> 00:57:43,061
Well,

2380
00:57:43,061 --> 00:57:43,391
actually,

2381
00:57:43,391 --> 00:57:45,370
so first off I got invited to youth,

2382
00:57:45,371 --> 00:57:45,851
nationals,

2383
00:57:45,851 --> 00:57:46,180
whatever.

2384
00:57:46,180 --> 00:57:47,200
So I'm like,

2385
00:57:47,201 --> 00:57:47,500
uh,

2386
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:50,950
like the Youth World Cup type thing
because I did well at US nationals.

2387
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:51,761
And so,

2388
00:57:51,761 --> 00:57:52,300
um,

2389
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:53,380
it gave me an excuse to be like,

2390
00:57:53,381 --> 00:57:55,630
I'm going to take the next semester
off and just like go to Europe,

2391
00:57:55,631 --> 00:57:57,130
do this youth camp and then,

2392
00:57:57,131 --> 00:57:57,490
uh,

2393
00:57:57,490 --> 00:57:59,020
and then travel Europe and climate bit,

2394
00:57:59,021 --> 00:57:59,470
you know,

2395
00:57:59,470 --> 00:57:59,861
so I was like,

2396
00:57:59,861 --> 00:57:59,960
well,

2397
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:01,240
I'm going to take next semester off.

2398
00:58:01,750 --> 00:58:02,171
And then,

2399
00:58:02,171 --> 00:58:02,381
um,

2400
00:58:02,381 --> 00:58:03,760
and then my dad died that summer.

2401
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:04,880
And so,

2402
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:05,140
you know,

2403
00:58:05,140 --> 00:58:07,720
I was taking the semester off and then
he left enough money for my sister and I

2404
00:58:07,770 --> 00:58:08,321
finished school,

2405
00:58:08,321 --> 00:58:09,041
like life insurance,

2406
00:58:09,041 --> 00:58:09,251
you know,

2407
00:58:09,251 --> 00:58:10,540
for us both to finish college.

2408
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:11,291
And,

2409
00:58:11,291 --> 00:58:12,124
um,

2410
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:13,270
and so I went to Europe,

2411
00:58:13,330 --> 00:58:13,640
you know,

2412
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:14,361
did this whole comp,

2413
00:58:14,361 --> 00:58:15,101
didn't do very well,

2414
00:58:15,101 --> 00:58:15,461
whatever,

2415
00:58:15,461 --> 00:58:16,300
but um,

2416
00:58:16,630 --> 00:58:18,070
and then just never went back to college.

2417
00:58:18,071 --> 00:58:20,950
And then you use the life insurance to
like travel and climb for a couple of

2418
00:58:20,950 --> 00:58:21,783
years.

2419
00:58:21,910 --> 00:58:22,743
Wow.

2420
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:23,733
Yeah.

2421
00:58:23,950 --> 00:58:24,610
Wow.

2422
00:58:24,610 --> 00:58:26,330
So cool.

2423
00:58:27,310 --> 00:58:28,960
So when you first started doing that,

2424
00:58:28,961 --> 00:58:31,990
did you ever believe that you could
get to a 0.1 day where you'd be a

2425
00:58:31,991 --> 00:58:33,220
professional he'd make,

2426
00:58:33,370 --> 00:58:34,031
I didn't even know.

2427
00:58:34,031 --> 00:58:35,770
I didn't even know there
were professional climbers.

2428
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:36,071
You know,

2429
00:58:36,071 --> 00:58:36,904
it'd be like,

2430
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:38,500
it's such a niche little thing.

2431
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:41,500
I mean all I knew is that I loved going
climbing and that there wasn't anything

2432
00:58:41,501 --> 00:58:45,130
else that I'd rather be doing and that
I wasn't super fired up on school.

2433
00:58:45,130 --> 00:58:46,390
And so I was just like,

2434
00:58:46,391 --> 00:58:47,710
well I'm just going to go on a road trip.

2435
00:58:47,890 --> 00:58:49,870
The road trip is kind of like
a classic climbing thing.

2436
00:58:49,871 --> 00:58:53,500
Everybody goes on the road trip and just
travels and climbs and follows the good

2437
00:58:53,501 --> 00:58:53,980
weather.

2438
00:58:53,980 --> 00:58:55,300
And so I just did that for a few years.

2439
00:58:55,301 --> 00:58:58,600
And then that's just like
a climber community thing.

2440
00:58:58,720 --> 00:58:59,200
Yeah.

2441
00:58:59,200 --> 00:58:59,471
Yeah.

2442
00:58:59,471 --> 00:59:01,660
A lot of like most
climbers do that basically.

2443
00:59:03,030 --> 00:59:03,880
Cause you kind of have to,

2444
00:59:03,881 --> 00:59:04,714
because you have to,

2445
00:59:04,930 --> 00:59:07,300
you have to be at the different
rocks in different places,

2446
00:59:07,301 --> 00:59:07,901
in good weather.

2447
00:59:07,901 --> 00:59:08,261
So I mean,

2448
00:59:08,261 --> 00:59:09,220
you have to constantly move,

2449
00:59:10,460 --> 00:59:11,440
but wow.

2450
00:59:11,470 --> 00:59:12,820
So while you're doing this,

2451
00:59:12,970 --> 00:59:13,630
you just thinking,

2452
00:59:13,630 --> 00:59:14,051
Hey,

2453
00:59:14,051 --> 00:59:14,630
I've,

2454
00:59:14,630 --> 00:59:15,190
I just,

2455
00:59:15,190 --> 00:59:16,510
I've got the time to do this now.

2456
00:59:16,511 --> 00:59:17,380
I'm enjoying doing this.

2457
00:59:17,381 --> 00:59:19,000
Now let's just do it
cause I want to do it.

2458
00:59:19,060 --> 00:59:19,330
Yeah.

2459
00:59:19,330 --> 00:59:20,163
Basically.

2460
00:59:20,530 --> 00:59:21,363
I mean,

2461
00:59:21,470 --> 00:59:22,250
you know,

2462
00:59:22,250 --> 00:59:23,031
at the time I was like,

2463
00:59:23,031 --> 00:59:23,211
oh,

2464
00:59:23,211 --> 00:59:25,610
maybe if I get really good
that'll give me some free shoes,

2465
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:26,031
you know,

2466
00:59:26,031 --> 00:59:26,391
because,

2467
00:59:26,391 --> 00:59:27,020
uh,

2468
00:59:27,020 --> 00:59:29,510
I mean for sure I knew that you could
get sponsored whenever that meant.

2469
00:59:29,510 --> 00:59:29,721
You know,

2470
00:59:29,721 --> 00:59:29,961
it was like,

2471
00:59:29,961 --> 00:59:30,111
oh,

2472
00:59:30,111 --> 00:59:32,570
they'll send you free ropes and they'll
give you free shoes and they'll give you

2473
00:59:32,571 --> 00:59:33,051
a harness.

2474
00:59:33,051 --> 00:59:33,201
Like,

2475
00:59:33,201 --> 00:59:33,981
that's so rad,

2476
00:59:33,981 --> 00:59:34,610
you know?

2477
00:59:34,610 --> 00:59:34,971
And so,

2478
00:59:34,971 --> 00:59:35,300
um,

2479
00:59:35,300 --> 00:59:37,100
so I picked up a little sponsors
like that where I was like,

2480
00:59:37,101 --> 00:59:37,250
oh,

2481
00:59:37,250 --> 00:59:38,690
now I'm getting my free shoes.

2482
00:59:38,691 --> 00:59:39,431
I'm so psyched,

2483
00:59:39,431 --> 00:59:39,840
you know?

2484
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:40,220
Wow.

2485
00:59:40,220 --> 00:59:40,551
And then,

2486
00:59:40,551 --> 00:59:40,850
um,

2487
00:59:40,850 --> 00:59:43,220
and then it sort of has
like slowly snowballed,

2488
00:59:43,221 --> 00:59:43,461
you know,

2489
00:59:43,461 --> 00:59:43,790
are like,

2490
00:59:43,790 --> 00:59:43,901
oh,

2491
00:59:43,901 --> 00:59:44,780
now they're actually paid me.

2492
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:46,280
Like my first,

2493
00:59:46,310 --> 00:59:46,911
my first,

2494
00:59:46,911 --> 00:59:47,450
uh,

2495
00:59:47,450 --> 00:59:50,930
my rope sponsor was the first people to
pay me and they were paying me 100 bucks

2496
00:59:50,931 --> 00:59:51,651
a month and I was like,

2497
00:59:51,651 --> 00:59:52,161
yeah,

2498
00:59:52,161 --> 00:59:53,480
I'm making 100 bucks a month.

2499
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:57,520
Rope sponsor one of those ropes might've,

2500
00:59:58,090 --> 00:59:58,560
uh,

2501
00:59:58,560 --> 00:59:59,181
like nylon,

2502
00:59:59,181 --> 01:00:00,170
same as every other.

2503
01:00:00,230 --> 01:00:01,550
Does anybody make a hemp one?

2504
01:00:01,970 --> 01:00:02,221
Uh,

2505
01:00:02,221 --> 01:00:03,170
that's like the old school.

2506
01:00:03,171 --> 01:00:04,004
It's been replaced.

2507
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:05,000
Is the nylon better?

2508
01:00:05,060 --> 01:00:05,241
Yeah,

2509
01:00:05,241 --> 01:00:06,074
the nylon is way better.

2510
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:07,080
What is a z?

2511
01:00:07,180 --> 01:00:08,220
You can get tighter.

2512
01:00:08,250 --> 01:00:09,140
It can get stronger.

2513
01:00:09,141 --> 01:00:09,601
Is that what it is?

2514
01:00:09,601 --> 01:00:10,790
That's probably durability I think.

2515
01:00:10,791 --> 01:00:12,410
And I think part of its elasticity,

2516
01:00:12,411 --> 01:00:13,980
I think hemp like stretches more and,

2517
01:00:14,030 --> 01:00:15,890
and breaks easier and whatever.

2518
01:00:16,010 --> 01:00:16,341
Not on,

2519
01:00:16,341 --> 01:00:17,030
it's just better.

2520
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:17,391
Yeah.

2521
01:00:17,391 --> 01:00:18,830
There's no like a dude,

2522
01:00:18,831 --> 01:00:21,770
just try to keep it real and go climbing
with hemp rope and everybody else like,

2523
01:00:21,771 --> 01:00:22,011
Hey,

2524
01:00:22,011 --> 01:00:22,940
what the fuck for sure.

2525
01:00:22,941 --> 01:00:23,571
With the ropes,

2526
01:00:23,571 --> 01:00:24,141
nobody's like,

2527
01:00:24,141 --> 01:00:25,130
I want to go old school.

2528
01:00:25,131 --> 01:00:26,890
I want to use the oldest route possible.

2529
01:00:26,950 --> 01:00:28,370
People we're with the hemp man.

2530
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:29,270
No impact.

2531
01:00:29,270 --> 01:00:30,590
Like a weird sort of,

2532
01:00:30,591 --> 01:00:30,950
um,

2533
01:00:30,950 --> 01:00:31,880
attachment to it.

2534
01:00:31,881 --> 01:00:34,040
Like not for when your life depends on it.

2535
01:00:34,041 --> 01:00:34,551
And nobody's like,

2536
01:00:34,551 --> 01:00:35,384
I want him.

2537
01:00:37,210 --> 01:00:38,770
All right,

2538
01:00:42,180 --> 01:00:44,460
well maybe they do and
they're not here anymore.

2539
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:45,630
It was exactly,

2540
01:00:45,690 --> 01:00:46,171
yeah.

2541
01:00:46,171 --> 01:00:48,000
They smoked a little too
much and they were like,

2542
01:00:48,060 --> 01:00:48,720
oops.

2543
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:50,130
It turns out him doesn't really hold.

2544
01:00:50,310 --> 01:00:50,930
I got to,

2545
01:00:50,930 --> 01:00:51,680
I have these tea,

2546
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:52,513
this tee shirt line,

2547
01:00:52,540 --> 01:00:56,280
higher primates and the biggest complaint
was that why are you selling hemp tee

2548
01:00:56,281 --> 01:01:00,220
shirts dude or under the
amended a pimp welcome hump.

2549
01:01:00,790 --> 01:01:01,623
That's never been a habit

2550
01:01:01,720 --> 01:01:04,000
teacher that didn't feel like
I was wearing a grain sack.

2551
01:01:04,060 --> 01:01:04,480
Oh,

2552
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:08,210
what's that one guy that makes those
bags that you're friends with that sora

2553
01:01:08,260 --> 01:01:08,920
that sir,

2554
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:10,750
I have it that Sarah a tee shirt.

2555
01:01:10,751 --> 01:01:12,970
Hemp tee shirt is soft as fuck.

2556
01:01:13,020 --> 01:01:13,853
Was a really,

2557
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:14,793
really nice,

2558
01:01:14,990 --> 01:01:17,090
it's thick and meaning.

2559
01:01:17,540 --> 01:01:18,910
Well that's not why I like it.

2560
01:01:18,911 --> 01:01:21,940
The this is you like high end thin,

2561
01:01:21,941 --> 01:01:23,730
lightweight cotton.

2562
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:25,680
It's cotton and uh,

2563
01:01:25,740 --> 01:01:27,030
it's like a blend cotton,

2564
01:01:27,031 --> 01:01:27,211
some,

2565
01:01:27,211 --> 01:01:28,710
some sort of nylon or something like that.

2566
01:01:28,810 --> 01:01:29,920
Nice body shirts.

2567
01:01:29,921 --> 01:01:30,754
Just what feels,

2568
01:01:30,850 --> 01:01:31,683
oh that

2569
01:01:32,910 --> 01:01:33,611
Midwest guys,

2570
01:01:33,611 --> 01:01:33,881
they're like,

2571
01:01:33,881 --> 01:01:34,150
oh,

2572
01:01:34,150 --> 01:01:36,040
you can see my nipples through
the shirt you don't like.

2573
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:40,120
So you are you looking for
something to drape over your friend?

2574
01:01:40,730 --> 01:01:41,563
Hi,

2575
01:01:42,090 --> 01:01:43,690
my sexy.

2576
01:01:44,260 --> 01:01:45,093
Uh,

2577
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:47,333
that's what it is.

2578
01:01:47,370 --> 01:01:48,720
I just like things that are lightweight.

2579
01:01:49,160 --> 01:01:50,880
They don't restrict me when I move,

2580
01:01:51,390 --> 01:01:51,691
but uh,

2581
01:01:51,691 --> 01:01:52,320
yeah,

2582
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:53,400
that's where it has great shit.

2583
01:01:53,401 --> 01:01:53,850
He's,

2584
01:01:53,850 --> 01:01:54,090
he's,

2585
01:01:54,090 --> 01:01:55,350
he wants to sponsor the podcast,

2586
01:01:55,351 --> 01:01:56,950
so we'll just do a cut line.

2587
01:01:57,480 --> 01:01:59,970
That's where it makes some gym bags,

2588
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:01,471
laptop bags,

2589
01:02:01,471 --> 01:02:03,180
but back all of its high quality hemp,

2590
01:02:03,390 --> 01:02:04,680
Colorado recently,

2591
01:02:04,710 --> 01:02:05,100
uh,

2592
01:02:05,100 --> 01:02:05,910
as,

2593
01:02:05,910 --> 01:02:06,750
as far as,

2594
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:07,440
um,

2595
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:10,890
the new thing that's been passed
that makes marijuana legal,

2596
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:13,290
it also makes growing hemp legal.

2597
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:17,010
And the first guy is stepping
up to start a hemp farm.

2598
01:02:17,250 --> 01:02:18,160
So awesome.

2599
01:02:18,970 --> 01:02:20,290
We have to start a Kickstarter

2600
01:02:20,290 --> 01:02:23,270
for his legal fund from the DEA
comes and locks them up and some,

2601
01:02:23,590 --> 01:02:24,091
because of the,

2602
01:02:24,091 --> 01:02:27,310
like the National Defense
Authorization Act and the Patriot Act,

2603
01:02:27,311 --> 01:02:30,670
that guy becomes a terrorist and
they lock him in some fucking sell in

2604
01:02:30,671 --> 01:02:31,510
Guantanamo Bay.

2605
01:02:31,511 --> 01:02:32,500
And that's not a joke,

2606
01:02:32,501 --> 01:02:33,180
folks.

2607
01:02:33,180 --> 01:02:33,481
Have you,

2608
01:02:33,481 --> 01:02:35,320
if you're selling drugs in any way,

2609
01:02:35,321 --> 01:02:36,100
shape or form,

2610
01:02:36,100 --> 01:02:37,330
you're like a terrorist now.

2611
01:02:37,630 --> 01:02:39,310
And if you're selling hemp,

2612
01:02:39,370 --> 01:02:42,580
even though it's not even psychoactive
and not the psychoactive form of

2613
01:02:42,581 --> 01:02:43,330
marijuana,

2614
01:02:43,330 --> 01:02:47,350
it's still federally illegal and
they would treat you the same way.

2615
01:02:47,351 --> 01:02:48,900
They would treat someone
who was growing heroin.

2616
01:02:49,850 --> 01:02:51,850
It's so stupid.

2617
01:02:51,851 --> 01:02:56,200
It's so fucking stupid because what what
people don't understand is we sell hemp

2618
01:02:56,860 --> 01:02:57,520
at on it.

2619
01:02:57,520 --> 01:02:58,720
We have hemp protein.

2620
01:02:58,750 --> 01:02:59,680
It's delicious.

2621
01:02:59,681 --> 01:03:00,401
It's nutritious.

2622
01:03:00,401 --> 01:03:03,820
It's you don't test positive for
THC because there's not any in it.

2623
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,700
You get this stuff from the male plant,

2624
01:03:06,701 --> 01:03:07,461
the hemp plant,

2625
01:03:07,461 --> 01:03:08,320
the cannabis plant.

2626
01:03:08,500 --> 01:03:10,270
It doesn't have any
psychoactive capability.

2627
01:03:10,271 --> 01:03:12,370
You would have to get like a
whole forest of it to get high,

2628
01:03:12,790 --> 01:03:13,623
but,

2629
01:03:13,630 --> 01:03:17,650
but it is very nutritious
and it is very illegal.

2630
01:03:18,100 --> 01:03:19,450
We have to buy from Canada,

2631
01:03:19,630 --> 01:03:21,100
so we're allowed to have it,

2632
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:22,300
but we can't grow it.

2633
01:03:22,540 --> 01:03:24,250
It's the dumbest thing in the world,

2634
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:25,720
so they buy it.

2635
01:03:26,170 --> 01:03:27,040
We have to,

2636
01:03:27,070 --> 01:03:28,510
the Canadians have to grow it.

2637
01:03:28,810 --> 01:03:30,940
We get it from them and then we sell it,

2638
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:32,350
but if we grow it,

2639
01:03:32,410 --> 01:03:34,660
they'll lock us in jail
for a hundred years.

2640
01:03:34,930 --> 01:03:37,510
If you grow the plants that you,

2641
01:03:37,540 --> 01:03:41,410
you need to make hemp protein powder
or hemp oil or any of that shit,

2642
01:03:41,411 --> 01:03:44,260
they'll just lock you in
jail for federal crimes.

2643
01:03:45,040 --> 01:03:45,873
It's insane.

2644
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:48,970
It's unbelievable how
dumb the the world is.

2645
01:03:49,030 --> 01:03:49,421
It's just,

2646
01:03:49,421 --> 01:03:49,931
it's really,

2647
01:03:49,931 --> 01:03:54,931
it hurts my brain sometimes that it's
2013 and that with the it access to

2648
01:03:55,481 --> 01:03:59,830
information that we have the world and
the government still hasn't caught up.

2649
01:03:59,890 --> 01:04:04,890
The people in positions of power are
still operating like it's the 1950s in the

2650
01:04:05,650 --> 01:04:07,510
1960s and everybody's fucking stupid.

2651
01:04:08,080 --> 01:04:08,611
And it's,

2652
01:04:08,611 --> 01:04:09,730
it's really amazing.

2653
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:11,890
It's drives me crazy.

2654
01:04:12,490 --> 01:04:15,220
How many people get high and climb most?

2655
01:04:15,610 --> 01:04:16,270
Whoa.

2656
01:04:16,270 --> 01:04:17,081
I'm not going to do it though,

2657
01:04:17,081 --> 01:04:17,914
but yeah,

2658
01:04:18,130 --> 01:04:18,941
I would think that,

2659
01:04:18,941 --> 01:04:19,390
um,

2660
01:04:19,390 --> 01:04:20,081
maybe not most,

2661
01:04:20,081 --> 01:04:21,520
but a lot say a lot.

2662
01:04:21,820 --> 01:04:22,830
I wouldn't do it.

2663
01:04:23,410 --> 01:04:23,670
Yeah.

2664
01:04:23,670 --> 01:04:25,620
There's a last place
you want to be paranoid

2665
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:28,073
lunches.

2666
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:28,993
Jesus.

2667
01:04:29,010 --> 01:04:29,320
Yeah.

2668
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:29,580
Warm.

2669
01:04:29,580 --> 01:04:30,480
You have the Munchies,

2670
01:04:30,481 --> 01:04:32,820
you got five hours to go
to get to the top point.

2671
01:04:32,821 --> 01:04:34,110
You need a quail egg.

2672
01:04:35,720 --> 01:04:38,340
There's some specific
nests that you'd go to.

2673
01:04:38,341 --> 01:04:39,210
It's been mapped out.

2674
01:04:39,690 --> 01:04:41,100
Hikers Digest,

2675
01:04:41,670 --> 01:04:44,670
however 60 go up there and
eat that fucking port birds,

2676
01:04:44,671 --> 01:04:45,070
eggs.

2677
01:04:45,070 --> 01:04:48,690
Try to get enough energy to make it
to the top so you can stay alive.

2678
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:48,991
Yeah.

2679
01:04:48,991 --> 01:04:49,970
You don't want to get the munchies

2680
01:04:50,060 --> 01:04:51,020
or climbing a mountain.

2681
01:04:52,330 --> 01:04:54,960
Do you have a poop bag and stuff when
you go up there or do you just check for

2682
01:04:54,961 --> 01:04:56,650
you if you're growing up for
like a week or some of them?

2683
01:04:56,660 --> 01:04:57,420
Yeah.

2684
01:04:57,420 --> 01:04:58,570
I mean if you're doing day missions,

2685
01:04:59,010 --> 01:05:00,490
how are we in the middle of a climb?

2686
01:05:00,491 --> 01:05:01,324
Yeah,

2687
01:05:02,560 --> 01:05:03,341
it happens.

2688
01:05:03,341 --> 01:05:04,290
You just let it go.

2689
01:05:06,300 --> 01:05:07,133
What do you think you do

2690
01:05:08,610 --> 01:05:08,880
it?

2691
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:12,200
Just take a break to take
your pants off later.

2692
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:15,140
I know for sure you take your pants off
and you do while you're climbing with

2693
01:05:15,141 --> 01:05:15,370
no,

2694
01:05:15,370 --> 01:05:16,960
there was a little ledges
and little stances,

2695
01:05:17,110 --> 01:05:18,290
like something you can share.

2696
01:05:18,291 --> 01:05:20,460
You get there and you just go
buck wild the rest of the way.

2697
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:21,910
Just do whatever you go naked.

2698
01:05:22,130 --> 01:05:22,271
No,

2699
01:05:22,271 --> 01:05:22,360
no,

2700
01:05:22,360 --> 01:05:22,451
no.

2701
01:05:22,451 --> 01:05:24,130
You just shake the shit out,

2702
01:05:24,131 --> 01:05:24,520
put it back.

2703
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:25,780
You don't poop your pants.

2704
01:05:25,781 --> 01:05:25,991
I mean,

2705
01:05:25,991 --> 01:05:26,824
you put it down,

2706
01:05:26,850 --> 01:05:28,440
you take a poop and then the best,

2707
01:05:28,450 --> 01:05:31,360
the best is to shit put where you poop
onto a rock and then you hurl the rock

2708
01:05:31,361 --> 01:05:32,194
off into the abyss.

2709
01:05:33,340 --> 01:05:34,173
Shit pudding.

2710
01:05:35,190 --> 01:05:35,531
It's like,

2711
01:05:35,531 --> 01:05:36,490
it's pretty legit.

2712
01:05:36,580 --> 01:05:36,881
Okay,

2713
01:05:36,881 --> 01:05:38,050
so you've never been climbing,

2714
01:05:38,051 --> 01:05:39,040
you just shit your pants.

2715
01:05:39,120 --> 01:05:39,810
No,

2716
01:05:39,810 --> 01:05:42,950
that's what I thought you meant when
you said your shit all over the place.

2717
01:05:43,190 --> 01:05:44,870
I need just let him know.

2718
01:05:44,871 --> 01:05:47,440
The worst case scenarios is
that you have a robot bonding.

2719
01:05:47,460 --> 01:05:48,710
You have to poop immediately.

2720
01:05:48,711 --> 01:05:50,240
And so you just like swing to the side.

2721
01:05:50,241 --> 01:05:52,290
You pull your harness and
pants as far as you can't eat,

2722
01:05:52,310 --> 01:05:53,360
just poop all over the wall.

2723
01:05:53,630 --> 01:05:54,760
That's like the worst case scenario.

2724
01:05:54,770 --> 01:05:55,070
You really,

2725
01:05:55,070 --> 01:05:55,903
wow.

2726
01:05:56,510 --> 01:05:59,810
We need to make videos of this video.

2727
01:06:00,230 --> 01:06:03,050
There's an amazing climbing video of
a dude actually pooping his pants.

2728
01:06:03,170 --> 01:06:03,411
Oh,

2729
01:06:03,411 --> 01:06:04,660
that you some friends on that up.

2730
01:06:04,670 --> 01:06:05,580
How do you find it?

2731
01:06:05,980 --> 01:06:10,680
Just Google a Boogie
till you poop because uh,

2732
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:11,210
the,

2733
01:06:11,210 --> 01:06:14,480
the guy was climbing a route called
Boogie till you puke and then he went up

2734
01:06:14,481 --> 01:06:17,930
there and then he pooped himself
various but you took you poop.

2735
01:06:18,020 --> 01:06:18,201
Yeah.

2736
01:06:18,201 --> 01:06:21,290
You just gotta be careful about your
diet when you're climbing up fucking

2737
01:06:21,291 --> 01:06:21,711
mountains.

2738
01:06:21,711 --> 01:06:22,011
Do you,

2739
01:06:22,011 --> 01:06:24,050
do you watch your diet and
you have like a very specific,

2740
01:06:24,051 --> 01:06:24,680
um,

2741
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:25,640
nutritious diet?

2742
01:06:25,641 --> 01:06:26,061
A little bit.

2743
01:06:26,061 --> 01:06:26,511
I actually,

2744
01:06:26,511 --> 01:06:28,610
I've been vegetarian for like
a month and a little bit.

2745
01:06:28,730 --> 01:06:28,911
Yeah.

2746
01:06:28,911 --> 01:06:29,361
How do you like him?

2747
01:06:29,361 --> 01:06:30,021
That I don't know.

2748
01:06:30,021 --> 01:06:30,854
It seems all right.

2749
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:31,551
I mean,

2750
01:06:31,551 --> 01:06:31,881
we'll see.

2751
01:06:31,881 --> 01:06:32,661
I feel the exact same.

2752
01:06:32,661 --> 01:06:33,830
Is this the one with the video?

2753
01:06:33,860 --> 01:06:34,550
The Guy Shane?

2754
01:06:34,550 --> 01:06:34,761
Yeah,

2755
01:06:34,761 --> 01:06:35,594
totally.

2756
01:06:35,690 --> 01:06:36,171
It's actually,

2757
01:06:36,171 --> 01:06:37,640
it's one of my favorite car videos.

2758
01:06:39,090 --> 01:06:39,923
Yeah.

2759
01:06:40,090 --> 01:06:40,751
And is this,

2760
01:06:40,751 --> 01:06:41,584
um,

2761
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:44,760
requires a rescue?

2762
01:06:45,210 --> 01:06:45,850
Let's see.

2763
01:06:45,850 --> 01:06:47,520
So you see free soloing this?

2764
01:06:47,640 --> 01:06:47,910
No.

2765
01:06:47,910 --> 01:06:49,080
So he has a rope and everything,

2766
01:06:49,081 --> 01:06:52,020
but the thing is he's
calming a wide crack and uh,

2767
01:06:52,140 --> 01:06:54,690
like it's too big for him to put
his hands in fists into or whatever.

2768
01:06:54,691 --> 01:06:57,480
So he has to wedge his leg in
and so he gets his leg stuck,

2769
01:06:57,760 --> 01:06:58,441
like stuck,

2770
01:06:58,441 --> 01:06:59,250
stuck.

2771
01:06:59,250 --> 01:06:59,910
Oh Wow.

2772
01:06:59,910 --> 01:07:01,140
So this is him being like,

2773
01:07:01,141 --> 01:07:01,501
Oh God,

2774
01:07:01,501 --> 01:07:02,334
I'm stuck.

2775
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:07,170
And so then this other buddy who was
filming it is down there trying to help

2776
01:07:07,171 --> 01:07:08,004
them like extra cans,

2777
01:07:08,010 --> 01:07:09,370
like little shits on him.

2778
01:07:09,910 --> 01:07:10,211
Well,

2779
01:07:10,211 --> 01:07:10,361
no,

2780
01:07:10,361 --> 01:07:11,230
he's shitting his pants.

2781
01:07:17,930 --> 01:07:18,763
But

2782
01:07:19,340 --> 01:07:19,701
no.

2783
01:07:19,701 --> 01:07:21,110
Is this ever happened to
you where you get stuck?

2784
01:07:22,250 --> 01:07:24,110
Then he starts dry even
cause he's all over.

2785
01:07:24,130 --> 01:07:24,500
It's back.

2786
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:25,333
Pretty Gross.

2787
01:07:25,670 --> 01:07:26,530
Wow.

2788
01:07:28,250 --> 01:07:29,083
Fucking mouth.

2789
01:07:29,430 --> 01:07:31,710
So this was during like the
Squamish mountain festival,

2790
01:07:31,950 --> 01:07:33,090
big climbing party up in,

2791
01:07:33,210 --> 01:07:34,260
up by Vancouver.

2792
01:07:34,790 --> 01:07:35,431
You know,

2793
01:07:35,431 --> 01:07:37,200
everybody parties as France.

2794
01:07:40,550 --> 01:07:41,970
I Shit my pants.

2795
01:07:43,970 --> 01:07:45,170
Does he get out of this?

2796
01:07:45,330 --> 01:07:45,681
And by the way,

2797
01:07:45,681 --> 01:07:47,510
this has two podcasts in a row.

2798
01:07:47,620 --> 01:07:48,800
Well we showed you shit.

2799
01:07:48,801 --> 01:07:49,850
Your pants videos.

2800
01:07:50,150 --> 01:07:50,930
Yes.

2801
01:07:50,930 --> 01:07:52,580
We showed that George Brett Shit,

2802
01:07:52,581 --> 01:07:54,200
your pants story trip.

2803
01:07:55,520 --> 01:07:56,510
This guy get out of this.

2804
01:07:56,630 --> 01:07:57,463
Eventually they

2805
01:07:59,390 --> 01:08:00,290
torture video.

2806
01:08:00,291 --> 01:08:01,220
This is scary.

2807
01:08:01,530 --> 01:08:04,490
He's stuck and shits his pants puke.

2808
01:08:04,550 --> 01:08:08,200
And the guy below him is like
just down when the relaxed,

2809
01:08:08,730 --> 01:08:09,890
one of my really good friends,

2810
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:11,690
he's just try to help them out.

2811
01:08:11,691 --> 01:08:12,400
You know,

2812
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:13,233
it's pretty butted.

2813
01:08:13,340 --> 01:08:13,850
Wow.

2814
01:08:13,850 --> 01:08:14,810
They're both are good friends.

2815
01:08:15,260 --> 01:08:16,880
Now when you do this climbing,

2816
01:08:16,881 --> 01:08:18,290
I'm ignorant to this as well.

2817
01:08:18,410 --> 01:08:18,860
When you,

2818
01:08:18,860 --> 01:08:21,080
when you climb up the mountain
and you're using ropes,

2819
01:08:21,470 --> 01:08:21,800
um,

2820
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:22,610
how do you do it?

2821
01:08:22,610 --> 01:08:23,690
What do you start out?

2822
01:08:23,720 --> 01:08:27,290
Do you like knock something in as
soon as you climbed a certain part,

2823
01:08:27,410 --> 01:08:31,410
knock something in that secure and then
connect your rope to it and then keep,

2824
01:08:31,970 --> 01:08:33,290
keep unconnecting it.

2825
01:08:33,291 --> 01:08:33,950
Do you recap?

2826
01:08:33,950 --> 01:08:36,380
You said generally you
started the ground with um,

2827
01:08:36,590 --> 01:08:37,670
what's called a rack of gear,

2828
01:08:37,671 --> 01:08:40,400
like an assortment of gear that you
have little things that you can put into

2829
01:08:40,401 --> 01:08:41,234
cracks or like,

2830
01:08:41,480 --> 01:08:42,140
you know,

2831
01:08:42,140 --> 01:08:42,471
whatever,

2832
01:08:42,471 --> 01:08:44,480
put into cracks journey and uh,

2833
01:08:44,481 --> 01:08:46,430
and so you climb up and
you put them in as you go,

2834
01:08:46,431 --> 01:08:47,420
you clip your rope into him.

2835
01:08:47,690 --> 01:08:48,890
So at any time if you fall,

2836
01:08:48,891 --> 01:08:49,491
you just fall,

2837
01:08:49,491 --> 01:08:50,020
doubled it.

2838
01:08:50,020 --> 01:08:51,230
And to the last piece of gear,

2839
01:08:51,710 --> 01:08:51,981
you know,

2840
01:08:51,981 --> 01:08:54,380
because you climb like say five
feet above the last piece of gear.

2841
01:08:54,550 --> 01:08:55,191
So if you fall,

2842
01:08:55,191 --> 01:08:57,620
you fall that five feet plus the
five feet of slack that you had to.

2843
01:08:58,040 --> 01:09:00,920
So how does it relax or how does the,

2844
01:09:00,980 --> 01:09:02,950
how does the robe disconnect from the one,

2845
01:09:03,170 --> 01:09:05,120
the second person has to
climb up it after you.

2846
01:09:05,510 --> 01:09:07,700
So if you're climbing
like a thousand foot wall,

2847
01:09:07,820 --> 01:09:09,720
then the first person climbs,

2848
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:10,170
you know,

2849
01:09:10,170 --> 01:09:11,390
say a hundred feet and stops.

2850
01:09:11,570 --> 01:09:14,000
And then brings up the
second person and then the,

2851
01:09:14,210 --> 01:09:16,040
then they do it again over
and over the whole way.

2852
01:09:16,370 --> 01:09:18,140
It's called pitches or like rope lengths.

2853
01:09:18,650 --> 01:09:21,230
So you climb like one rope length and
then you do the next one and then you do

2854
01:09:21,231 --> 01:09:22,040
the next one.

2855
01:09:22,040 --> 01:09:27,040
Is the technology for these pieces of
equipment so good that nothing ever fails?

2856
01:09:28,100 --> 01:09:29,120
I mean for the most part,

2857
01:09:29,121 --> 01:09:30,620
I mean like everything breaks,

2858
01:09:30,621 --> 01:09:31,070
you know,

2859
01:09:31,070 --> 01:09:33,560
like everything in life will
break in the right circumstances.

2860
01:09:33,560 --> 01:09:34,160
But um,

2861
01:09:34,160 --> 01:09:36,200
but climbing year is really well made,

2862
01:09:36,201 --> 01:09:38,180
well manufactured and
like pretty well tested.

2863
01:09:38,660 --> 01:09:38,901
So,

2864
01:09:38,901 --> 01:09:39,734
um,

2865
01:09:39,770 --> 01:09:39,951
I mean,

2866
01:09:39,951 --> 01:09:40,131
yeah,

2867
01:09:40,131 --> 01:09:43,400
there are circumstances where you can
like trust your life to like a piece of

2868
01:09:43,401 --> 01:09:46,430
gear and like one little widget that
you put into a crack and you're like,

2869
01:09:46,431 --> 01:09:47,060
well,

2870
01:09:47,060 --> 01:09:47,271
you know,

2871
01:09:47,271 --> 01:09:48,470
but generally you back things up,

2872
01:09:48,471 --> 01:09:49,880
you have it all tripled or whatever.

2873
01:09:50,060 --> 01:09:50,893
Like,

2874
01:09:51,450 --> 01:09:53,420
and these things that you put into cracks,

2875
01:09:53,421 --> 01:09:55,700
they separate or something like it.

2876
01:09:56,020 --> 01:09:57,770
Now they call it cams
there caming devices.

2877
01:09:57,771 --> 01:09:59,990
So the two lobes sort of like
an umbrella or something.

2878
01:10:00,260 --> 01:10:03,290
So you pull a trigger and
they can contract and then
you put it into the crack

2879
01:10:03,350 --> 01:10:05,750
and then they expand outward
and then when you pull on them,

2880
01:10:05,780 --> 01:10:07,340
they expand outward even further.

2881
01:10:07,460 --> 01:10:08,960
And so they went to
themselves into the crack.

2882
01:10:09,190 --> 01:10:10,000
Ah.

2883
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:10,281
You know,

2884
01:10:10,281 --> 01:10:10,610
it's,

2885
01:10:10,610 --> 01:10:10,911
you know,

2886
01:10:10,911 --> 01:10:12,050
it's just a simple camming thing.

2887
01:10:12,050 --> 01:10:15,590
So it's just the pressure of that pushing
just much like that guy was climbing

2888
01:10:15,591 --> 01:10:15,760
them.

2889
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:15,980
Yeah,

2890
01:10:15,980 --> 01:10:16,371
exactly.

2891
01:10:16,371 --> 01:10:16,791
Exactly.

2892
01:10:16,791 --> 01:10:17,624
It's counter pressure.

2893
01:10:18,680 --> 01:10:20,420
And how was it designed?

2894
01:10:20,421 --> 01:10:21,590
Like what does it made out of?

2895
01:10:21,700 --> 01:10:23,060
Like aluminum I think,

2896
01:10:23,540 --> 01:10:24,373
cause it's light.

2897
01:10:24,490 --> 01:10:25,323
Wow.

2898
01:10:25,640 --> 01:10:26,900
But I mean they're rated to,

2899
01:10:27,620 --> 01:10:28,061
I mean they,

2900
01:10:28,061 --> 01:10:30,470
they go through a whole rigorous
testing process and they're,

2901
01:10:30,530 --> 01:10:32,780
they're pretty solid
stuff to following things.

2902
01:10:32,790 --> 01:10:34,550
What really freaks me out when they fall.

2903
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:35,750
Hang on that thing,

2904
01:10:35,930 --> 01:10:36,740
eh?

2905
01:10:36,740 --> 01:10:36,900
Yeah.

2906
01:10:36,900 --> 01:10:38,390
But you see that so often when,

2907
01:10:38,450 --> 01:10:39,021
as a climber,

2908
01:10:39,021 --> 01:10:39,201
you know,

2909
01:10:39,201 --> 01:10:40,490
that happens all the time.

2910
01:10:40,491 --> 01:10:41,324
And so it's just not,

2911
01:10:41,390 --> 01:10:41,751
you know,

2912
01:10:41,751 --> 01:10:42,590
it's totally normal.

2913
01:10:42,710 --> 01:10:44,630
So climbers are just used
to falling and getting,

2914
01:10:44,631 --> 01:10:45,920
so I'm sure like as a fighter,

2915
01:10:45,921 --> 01:10:47,090
you used to get knocked over.

2916
01:10:47,470 --> 01:10:50,690
You don't have any climbers used to
falling cause you're always to get better.

2917
01:10:50,691 --> 01:10:51,980
You have to push yourself to failure.

2918
01:10:52,010 --> 01:10:53,150
And so you're constantly falling,

2919
01:10:53,480 --> 01:10:54,050
you know,

2920
01:10:54,050 --> 01:10:55,610
obviously not for Solos but like,

2921
01:10:56,240 --> 01:10:57,320
but you know,

2922
01:10:57,321 --> 01:10:59,750
the majority of the time you have a
robe on and you're climbing to failure.

2923
01:11:00,590 --> 01:11:01,430
Now do you,

2924
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:01,950
when I,

2925
01:11:01,950 --> 01:11:03,140
when I asked you about your diet,

2926
01:11:03,170 --> 01:11:04,790
do you try to stay light?

2927
01:11:04,820 --> 01:11:06,080
Does that make it easier?

2928
01:11:06,220 --> 01:11:07,730
One of the things when we did fear factor,

2929
01:11:07,731 --> 01:11:09,290
one of the stunts that we had was,

2930
01:11:09,291 --> 01:11:09,770
uh,

2931
01:11:09,770 --> 01:11:10,221
people,

2932
01:11:10,221 --> 01:11:13,010
they were hanging over
this bridge by their,

2933
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:15,330
and they dropped into the water.

2934
01:11:15,390 --> 01:11:15,781
You know,

2935
01:11:15,781 --> 01:11:16,470
it wasn't that far,

2936
01:11:16,470 --> 01:11:19,080
but it was just the idea was
like who can hang on the longest?

2937
01:11:19,410 --> 01:11:21,570
And women won because they were lighter.

2938
01:11:21,630 --> 01:11:21,811
Yeah.

2939
01:11:21,811 --> 01:11:24,630
Because they were lighter because
we had one guy who was like a,

2940
01:11:24,660 --> 01:11:25,620
like a football player.

2941
01:11:25,650 --> 01:11:26,461
He was big,

2942
01:11:26,461 --> 01:11:27,300
strong guy.

2943
01:11:27,720 --> 01:11:28,860
Could not have that hands.

2944
01:11:28,861 --> 01:11:29,250
I mean,

2945
01:11:29,250 --> 01:11:29,510
yeah,

2946
01:11:29,510 --> 01:11:32,030
just small chest muscles.

2947
01:11:32,190 --> 01:11:32,550
Yeah.

2948
01:11:32,550 --> 01:11:33,331
Well being a big guy,

2949
01:11:33,331 --> 01:11:35,250
he's like a huge liability
if you're trying to hang on.

2950
01:11:35,370 --> 01:11:35,551
Yeah,

2951
01:11:35,551 --> 01:11:36,450
that's what I would imagine.

2952
01:11:36,451 --> 01:11:37,500
So do you,

2953
01:11:37,501 --> 01:11:38,070
um,

2954
01:11:38,070 --> 01:11:40,940
make sure that you don't
gain weight or do you mean,

2955
01:11:41,730 --> 01:11:42,160
I mean,

2956
01:11:42,160 --> 01:11:44,850
I love eating pastries and
stuff so I don't watch too much,

2957
01:11:44,851 --> 01:11:45,091
but,

2958
01:11:45,091 --> 01:11:45,510
um,

2959
01:11:45,510 --> 01:11:46,350
but I mean I try,

2960
01:11:46,370 --> 01:11:46,531
yeah,

2961
01:11:46,531 --> 01:11:46,831
for sure.

2962
01:11:46,831 --> 01:11:47,370
Very thin.

2963
01:11:47,370 --> 01:11:48,720
It must be a lot of calories.

2964
01:11:48,810 --> 01:11:49,480
Not that thin.

2965
01:11:49,480 --> 01:11:49,710
I mean,

2966
01:11:49,710 --> 01:11:50,370
Chris,

2967
01:11:50,370 --> 01:11:51,203
well you're not fat,

2968
01:11:51,220 --> 01:11:51,820
muscular.

2969
01:11:51,820 --> 01:11:52,660
I didn't mean that.

2970
01:11:53,650 --> 01:11:54,720
Certainly have muscle,

2971
01:11:54,721 --> 01:11:56,930
but I mean you're not a fat guy mean,

2972
01:11:57,840 --> 01:11:58,650
but you can't,

2973
01:11:58,650 --> 01:12:01,380
I mean you couldn't go climbing all
the time and it'd be a fat dude,

2974
01:12:01,381 --> 01:12:01,800
you know,

2975
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:03,060
cause it does burn a lot of calories.

2976
01:12:03,061 --> 01:12:03,211
Right?

2977
01:12:03,211 --> 01:12:03,330
Yeah.

2978
01:12:03,330 --> 01:12:03,601
I mean,

2979
01:12:03,601 --> 01:12:05,580
well just being outside all
the time and exercising,

2980
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:06,870
it's going to get you pretty fit.

2981
01:12:06,890 --> 01:12:09,060
Like when you have like
a big climb that day.

2982
01:12:09,060 --> 01:12:09,600
Do you,

2983
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:10,500
do you prep yourself?

2984
01:12:10,501 --> 01:12:12,120
Do you have like a pre climb meal?

2985
01:12:12,820 --> 01:12:13,740
Are you pretty much the same?

2986
01:12:13,750 --> 01:12:14,580
All the time?

2987
01:12:14,580 --> 01:12:15,450
I'd just eat stuff.

2988
01:12:15,720 --> 01:12:16,560
Just whatever you want.

2989
01:12:16,740 --> 01:12:17,573
Yeah.

2990
01:12:17,830 --> 01:12:18,570
I see.

2991
01:12:18,570 --> 01:12:21,630
And so just try not to eat
too much or like go hog wild,

2992
01:12:21,631 --> 01:12:22,464
you know?

2993
01:12:22,530 --> 01:12:23,363
Right.

2994
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:24,540
And no drinking.

2995
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:25,291
Yeah.

2996
01:12:25,291 --> 01:12:25,771
But that's just,

2997
01:12:25,771 --> 01:12:26,431
cause I'm not into it.

2998
01:12:26,431 --> 01:12:26,910
I don't know.

2999
01:12:26,910 --> 01:12:27,900
I just don't like it.

3000
01:12:28,680 --> 01:12:31,590
That seems like the worst place
to ever be where that guy was,

3001
01:12:31,591 --> 01:12:33,780
where it was hung over and he
was in the middle of the client.

3002
01:12:34,330 --> 01:12:35,050
That's exact.

3003
01:12:35,050 --> 01:12:35,610
That's,

3004
01:12:35,610 --> 01:12:35,870
you know,

3005
01:12:35,870 --> 01:12:37,170
that's part of the reason I don't drink.

3006
01:12:37,230 --> 01:12:38,041
I look at stuff like that.

3007
01:12:38,041 --> 01:12:38,491
I'm just like,

3008
01:12:38,491 --> 01:12:39,600
what does aster,

3009
01:12:40,290 --> 01:12:41,123
yeah.

3010
01:12:41,160 --> 01:12:43,260
What is your mindset
while you're climbing?

3011
01:12:43,350 --> 01:12:43,681
What do you,

3012
01:12:43,681 --> 01:12:44,910
what are you thinking of when you're,

3013
01:12:44,911 --> 01:12:45,744
when you're doing it?

3014
01:12:45,780 --> 01:12:46,680
No one's around.

3015
01:12:46,681 --> 01:12:47,514
It's just you.

3016
01:12:47,850 --> 01:12:48,031
I mean,

3017
01:12:48,031 --> 01:12:48,411
it depends.

3018
01:12:48,411 --> 01:12:49,470
So like on hard stuff,

3019
01:12:50,250 --> 01:12:51,960
I'm probably not really
thinking about anything.

3020
01:12:51,961 --> 01:12:54,740
I'm just executing the
movements that I have to do.

3021
01:12:54,910 --> 01:12:55,291
You know,

3022
01:12:55,291 --> 01:12:58,680
what people say about being in the moment
or a flow and all that kind of stuff.

3023
01:12:58,681 --> 01:12:58,921
I don't know.

3024
01:12:58,921 --> 01:13:01,590
I'm just doing what I do on easy stuff.

3025
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:05,400
It's the same as like going jogging or
swimming laps or anything where you just

3026
01:13:05,490 --> 01:13:06,900
think about whatever
you think about dinner.

3027
01:13:06,901 --> 01:13:09,120
I think about your to do
list and things like that.

3028
01:13:09,410 --> 01:13:10,243
Just so when they,

3029
01:13:10,350 --> 01:13:14,100
when it gets to the point where you
must focus exactly on what you're doing,

3030
01:13:14,130 --> 01:13:15,510
that's what you like it.

3031
01:13:16,050 --> 01:13:16,321
Yeah,

3032
01:13:16,321 --> 01:13:16,561
well,

3033
01:13:16,561 --> 01:13:20,010
I mean there's something fun about
just going out and going jogging too,

3034
01:13:20,011 --> 01:13:20,221
you know,

3035
01:13:20,221 --> 01:13:22,230
like just climbing up a
big peak or something.

3036
01:13:22,231 --> 01:13:23,790
And then when you get to the top
looking around and being like,

3037
01:13:23,791 --> 01:13:24,570
Oh that was fun.

3038
01:13:24,570 --> 01:13:26,070
But keeping her really
mellow the whole time.

3039
01:13:26,280 --> 01:13:27,120
But for sure the,

3040
01:13:27,121 --> 01:13:27,990
the harder stuff,

3041
01:13:28,020 --> 01:13:30,060
when it requires that
extra little something,

3042
01:13:30,090 --> 01:13:31,380
I mean that is more rewarding.

3043
01:13:31,570 --> 01:13:35,070
What does it feel like when you
get to the top of like hard stuff?

3044
01:13:35,071 --> 01:13:39,540
You just have crazy shit like I'm in
generally it gives kind of a general

3045
01:13:39,541 --> 01:13:40,210
satisfaction.

3046
01:13:40,210 --> 01:13:40,381
You know,

3047
01:13:40,381 --> 01:13:40,681
you're like,

3048
01:13:40,681 --> 01:13:41,560
that's red and Jay.

3049
01:13:41,640 --> 01:13:41,851
Well,

3050
01:13:41,851 --> 01:13:43,890
and also you're always in
these beautiful places.

3051
01:13:43,891 --> 01:13:45,000
The view's always amazing.

3052
01:13:45,290 --> 01:13:45,480
You know,

3053
01:13:45,480 --> 01:13:47,610
you're always by yourself
doing something really cool.

3054
01:13:47,611 --> 01:13:49,260
So I mean there's always that like,

3055
01:13:49,500 --> 01:13:49,790
you know,

3056
01:13:49,790 --> 01:13:51,840
Alation with like being where you are.

3057
01:13:51,870 --> 01:13:53,940
But then there's also that
deep satisfaction of like,

3058
01:13:53,970 --> 01:13:56,220
I just did something very
hard and did it well.

3059
01:13:56,420 --> 01:13:56,880
You know,

3060
01:13:56,880 --> 01:14:01,800
how many chicks started bombing on you
once you had this 60 minutes piece sued?

3061
01:14:01,801 --> 01:14:02,220
Not that,

3062
01:14:02,220 --> 01:14:02,880
not that many.

3063
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:03,720
Get the fuck out of here.

3064
01:14:03,721 --> 01:14:04,501
That's ridiculous.

3065
01:14:04,501 --> 01:14:06,240
I don't believe that I
don't have that much game.

3066
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:07,050
But you don't have,

3067
01:14:07,050 --> 01:14:07,883
you don't need any game.

3068
01:14:07,890 --> 01:14:08,950
I live in a band,

3069
01:14:11,180 --> 01:14:12,350
has a door that opens,

3070
01:14:12,350 --> 01:14:13,680
is it checked this willing to come inside.

3071
01:14:13,940 --> 01:14:14,773
Trust me.

3072
01:14:15,050 --> 01:14:15,231
Yeah.

3073
01:14:15,231 --> 01:14:16,850
Maybe I'll hang in the
wrong places or some shit.

3074
01:14:16,930 --> 01:14:18,350
He can't say you have no game dude.

3075
01:14:18,410 --> 01:14:19,243
That's ridiculous.

3076
01:14:19,580 --> 01:14:21,200
You're this climbing freak.

3077
01:14:21,380 --> 01:14:21,771
Okay.

3078
01:14:21,771 --> 01:14:24,370
That in itself is game maybe.

3079
01:14:24,530 --> 01:14:24,801
Yeah.

3080
01:14:24,801 --> 01:14:25,910
I didn't listen to it is,

3081
01:14:26,060 --> 01:14:26,331
you know,

3082
01:14:26,331 --> 01:14:27,310
it might not be your,

3083
01:14:27,311 --> 01:14:28,580
your main motivation,

3084
01:14:28,581 --> 01:14:29,414
but for,

3085
01:14:29,500 --> 01:14:29,930
you know,

3086
01:14:29,930 --> 01:14:30,980
most human beings,

3087
01:14:30,981 --> 01:14:33,560
one of the reasons why they get
really good at shit is to get pussy.

3088
01:14:33,740 --> 01:14:34,210
Well,

3089
01:14:34,210 --> 01:14:34,430
no,

3090
01:14:34,430 --> 01:14:34,851
for sure.

3091
01:14:34,851 --> 01:14:36,710
As I was getting better at climbing every,

3092
01:14:36,711 --> 01:14:36,951
you know,

3093
01:14:36,951 --> 01:14:37,670
every time I was like,

3094
01:14:37,670 --> 01:14:37,851
Oh,

3095
01:14:37,851 --> 01:14:39,620
if I got on the cover
of a climbing magazine,

3096
01:14:39,650 --> 01:14:41,700
then I'd get laid and then,

3097
01:14:41,990 --> 01:14:43,280
and then you get on the
cover and you're like,

3098
01:14:43,281 --> 01:14:43,730
dude,

3099
01:14:43,730 --> 01:14:44,600
nobody's calling.

3100
01:14:44,850 --> 01:14:45,680
It gives a shit,

3101
01:14:45,680 --> 01:14:46,340
you know?

3102
01:14:46,340 --> 01:14:46,850
And then you're like,

3103
01:14:46,850 --> 01:14:47,240
Oh,

3104
01:14:47,240 --> 01:14:49,430
if I get interviewed and like
men's journal or something,

3105
01:14:49,431 --> 01:14:50,570
then I'll start getting laid.

3106
01:14:50,571 --> 01:14:51,231
And then you're like,

3107
01:14:51,231 --> 01:14:51,471
dude,

3108
01:14:51,471 --> 01:14:53,000
turns out nobody reads that shit either.

3109
01:14:53,030 --> 01:14:53,840
You know.

3110
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:55,190
I wouldn't feel like men's journal,

3111
01:14:55,191 --> 01:14:56,920
like all those fitness magazines,

3112
01:14:56,940 --> 01:15:00,700
you buy it and when you're at the airport
and you'd let go at that like that and

3113
01:15:00,701 --> 01:15:04,400
they leave in your fucking
cover of national geographic,

3114
01:15:04,710 --> 01:15:05,101
all that.

3115
01:15:05,101 --> 01:15:06,870
That'll get me laid like turns out no.

3116
01:15:07,790 --> 01:15:08,960
Well not a lot of people reading

3117
01:15:11,050 --> 01:15:12,490
the problem.

3118
01:15:12,650 --> 01:15:13,070
Yeah.

3119
01:15:13,070 --> 01:15:14,210
But that 60 minutes piece,

3120
01:15:14,211 --> 01:15:17,270
that had to be a big difference between
everything else he did and then the

3121
01:15:17,271 --> 01:15:18,830
subsequent viewings of it on the Internet.

3122
01:15:18,860 --> 01:15:19,071
Yeah,

3123
01:15:19,071 --> 01:15:19,461
for sure.

3124
01:15:19,461 --> 01:15:20,271
I found out about it.

3125
01:15:20,271 --> 01:15:21,230
I didn't see it live.

3126
01:15:21,770 --> 01:15:22,191
It was a,

3127
01:15:22,191 --> 01:15:23,024
I think Twitter thing.

3128
01:15:23,060 --> 01:15:24,060
Someone sent me a link and said,

3129
01:15:24,061 --> 01:15:24,894
you've got to check this out.

3130
01:15:25,620 --> 01:15:29,600
And I think I jumped out of my
chair and I climbed on top of it.

3131
01:15:29,601 --> 01:15:32,030
Like those cartoons where
there's a mouse on the ground,

3132
01:15:32,300 --> 01:15:32,651
you know,

3133
01:15:32,651 --> 01:15:34,040
are you in a crouch and you just,

3134
01:15:34,041 --> 01:15:36,470
my feet were on the chair and I
was watching new climate thing.

3135
01:15:36,471 --> 01:15:36,900
It was all,

3136
01:15:36,900 --> 01:15:38,750
what the fuck is he doing?

3137
01:15:42,700 --> 01:15:44,110
You need a sex scandal or something?

3138
01:15:44,230 --> 01:15:44,411
No,

3139
01:15:44,411 --> 01:15:44,851
you don't need to,

3140
01:15:44,851 --> 01:15:48,940
I need a bigger van through dollars
hemp fan mean what the heck?

3141
01:15:48,941 --> 01:15:49,870
There was some online thing,

3142
01:15:49,871 --> 01:15:53,620
it was like a fuzzy dice ESPN like
list of top athletes or some shit.

3143
01:15:53,621 --> 01:15:56,200
And I beat Coby Bryant because
I hadn't had a sex scandal,

3144
01:15:56,500 --> 01:15:56,770
you know,

3145
01:15:56,770 --> 01:15:58,870
because they had this
whole algorithm that like,

3146
01:15:59,080 --> 01:15:59,291
you know,

3147
01:15:59,291 --> 01:16:01,540
took it and all of these different
things that you've done versus,

3148
01:16:01,780 --> 01:16:04,780
but then divided by the number of terrible
scandals you've had and all that dude

3149
01:16:04,781 --> 01:16:06,820
up beat Kobee because I live clean,

3150
01:16:06,821 --> 01:16:07,654
you know,

3151
01:16:09,270 --> 01:16:10,310
it's kind of classic.

3152
01:16:10,370 --> 01:16:11,203
That's hilarious.

3153
01:16:11,240 --> 01:16:15,050
I forgot what that one also shows how
stupid that fucking thing is that the

3154
01:16:15,620 --> 01:16:18,290
algorithm is retarded.

3155
01:16:18,590 --> 01:16:18,980
But um,

3156
01:16:18,980 --> 01:16:19,461
but you know,

3157
01:16:19,461 --> 01:16:20,294
I thought it was pretty funny.

3158
01:16:21,710 --> 01:16:23,090
It is pretty funny now,

3159
01:16:23,091 --> 01:16:23,600
um,

3160
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:24,433
have,

3161
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:30,280
have there been traditionally a lot of
girls that do this solo on there too?

3162
01:16:32,630 --> 01:16:33,650
I think too,

3163
01:16:34,350 --> 01:16:35,670
in the world ever.

3164
01:16:35,940 --> 01:16:36,510
I don't know.

3165
01:16:36,510 --> 01:16:36,691
Yeah,

3166
01:16:36,691 --> 01:16:37,260
basically.

3167
01:16:37,260 --> 01:16:38,040
Basically no,

3168
01:16:38,040 --> 01:16:40,680
but there are a handful
of girls that do do that,

3169
01:16:40,920 --> 01:16:43,680
but are there girls that do
like a lot of the rope stuff?

3170
01:16:43,870 --> 01:16:44,110
Yeah.

3171
01:16:44,110 --> 01:16:44,401
Yeah.

3172
01:16:44,401 --> 01:16:45,180
I mean,

3173
01:16:45,180 --> 01:16:45,991
especially in Europe,

3174
01:16:45,991 --> 01:16:46,830
I mean it's probably 50,

3175
01:16:46,831 --> 01:16:47,491
50 split,

3176
01:16:47,491 --> 01:16:47,880
you know,

3177
01:16:47,880 --> 01:16:49,260
real in the u s maybe it's 60,

3178
01:16:49,261 --> 01:16:50,130
40 or 70.

3179
01:16:50,131 --> 01:16:50,431
30.

3180
01:16:50,431 --> 01:16:51,420
But it's that big.

3181
01:16:51,450 --> 01:16:51,630
Yeah.

3182
01:16:51,630 --> 01:16:53,820
It's pretty close to get audience buddy.

3183
01:16:53,880 --> 01:16:54,061
Yeah.

3184
01:16:54,061 --> 01:16:55,900
I mean if you go to a gym style for you,

3185
01:16:56,630 --> 01:16:57,490
then now this town,

3186
01:16:57,491 --> 01:16:58,324
as far as chicks,

3187
01:16:58,520 --> 01:16:59,310
you need to go.

3188
01:16:59,310 --> 01:17:01,170
Those are the ones who are going
to be the most impressed with you.

3189
01:17:01,490 --> 01:17:01,950
You're what?

3190
01:17:01,950 --> 01:17:03,430
They're all private gravel faces.

3191
01:17:06,270 --> 01:17:08,610
Their faces have holes all over it.

3192
01:17:08,780 --> 01:17:09,770
Gravel face.

3193
01:17:09,771 --> 01:17:10,250
Why

3194
01:17:10,250 --> 01:17:11,450
he doesn't have from hitting?

3195
01:17:11,480 --> 01:17:12,190
No,

3196
01:17:12,190 --> 01:17:12,830
it looks fine.

3197
01:17:12,830 --> 01:17:12,981
Yeah,

3198
01:17:12,981 --> 01:17:13,910
but they probably have it in there.

3199
01:17:13,911 --> 01:17:14,990
I'm not even gonna go there.

3200
01:17:15,740 --> 01:17:16,890
Probably fuck up more though.

3201
01:17:17,900 --> 01:17:18,830
Is that what you were going to say?

3202
01:17:19,530 --> 01:17:19,831
I mean,

3203
01:17:19,831 --> 01:17:20,400
honestly,

3204
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:22,950
nowadays are the majority of
climbers climbing the gym in a city.

3205
01:17:23,050 --> 01:17:23,700
You know,

3206
01:17:23,700 --> 01:17:25,350
it's not like rugged mountain people.

3207
01:17:25,351 --> 01:17:28,320
It's just like college kids and
stuff to like go bolder in the gym.

3208
01:17:28,490 --> 01:17:29,370
And that's how you started.

3209
01:17:29,371 --> 01:17:30,830
You started in Sacramento.

3210
01:17:31,240 --> 01:17:32,130
Bad Ass town.

3211
01:17:32,131 --> 01:17:32,940
Love Sacramento.

3212
01:17:32,940 --> 01:17:35,550
Really liked doing standup up there.

3213
01:17:36,100 --> 01:17:36,933
They're wild.

3214
01:17:37,110 --> 01:17:37,861
It's like a,

3215
01:17:37,861 --> 01:17:39,570
it's like a combination of,

3216
01:17:39,571 --> 01:17:40,404
um,

3217
01:17:40,470 --> 01:17:42,180
like country people and city people.

3218
01:17:42,181 --> 01:17:44,310
It's like a weird sort of a blend,

3219
01:17:44,660 --> 01:17:44,930
you know?

3220
01:17:44,930 --> 01:17:45,330
Yeah.

3221
01:17:45,330 --> 01:17:46,350
It's kind of a Hickish city.

3222
01:17:46,780 --> 01:17:47,190
Yeah,

3223
01:17:47,190 --> 01:17:48,023
that's what I'm saying.

3224
01:17:48,060 --> 01:17:48,211
Now,

3225
01:17:48,211 --> 01:17:49,920
these people that,

3226
01:17:49,950 --> 01:17:54,110
that do these rock climbing gyms
like that own them and stuff that,

3227
01:17:54,111 --> 01:17:55,880
do most of them do the
stuff that you like,

3228
01:17:56,010 --> 01:17:57,000
not the stuff that you do,

3229
01:17:57,001 --> 01:17:57,560
but the,

3230
01:17:57,560 --> 01:17:58,321
the mountain stuff,

3231
01:17:58,321 --> 01:17:59,760
or is there a two distinct camps?

3232
01:17:59,761 --> 01:18:03,570
There's people who just do Jim
rock climbing and you know,

3233
01:18:03,630 --> 01:18:04,950
I wouldn't say that
they're distinct camps,

3234
01:18:04,951 --> 01:18:07,290
but for sure there are people
who just climb in the gym,

3235
01:18:07,530 --> 01:18:09,150
especially like the Bay area around,

3236
01:18:09,151 --> 01:18:09,610
uh,

3237
01:18:09,610 --> 01:18:09,880
you know,

3238
01:18:09,880 --> 01:18:11,160
San Francisco and Berkeley and all that.

3239
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:12,060
They're probably,

3240
01:18:12,060 --> 01:18:12,460
you know,

3241
01:18:12,460 --> 01:18:14,340
thousands of climbers that to them,

3242
01:18:14,341 --> 01:18:16,020
rock climbing just means going to the gym.

3243
01:18:16,180 --> 01:18:16,530
Hmm.

3244
01:18:16,530 --> 01:18:16,831
You know,

3245
01:18:16,831 --> 01:18:17,664
but then,

3246
01:18:18,030 --> 01:18:19,590
but then maybe half the people in the gym,

3247
01:18:19,591 --> 01:18:21,410
also God doors every weekend and all that.

3248
01:18:21,510 --> 01:18:21,990
You know,

3249
01:18:21,990 --> 01:18:23,340
it would seem to me that the,

3250
01:18:23,580 --> 01:18:27,560
the rock climbing that Jim could not be
nearly as exciting even if it was real

3251
01:18:27,580 --> 01:18:28,050
but,

3252
01:18:28,050 --> 01:18:28,600
but you know,

3253
01:18:28,600 --> 01:18:29,610
I mean whatever,

3254
01:18:29,630 --> 01:18:32,460
they're also people doing like zoom
button in the gym to work out or whatever

3255
01:18:32,461 --> 01:18:32,790
that meant.

3256
01:18:32,790 --> 01:18:33,301
You know what I mean?

3257
01:18:33,301 --> 01:18:37,470
Like chooses something and climbing
and certainly like more fun than,

3258
01:18:37,500 --> 01:18:38,700
than most ways to work out.

3259
01:18:38,701 --> 01:18:41,100
You know what I was going to get
to is when you first started,

3260
01:18:41,101 --> 01:18:43,110
you did it in the gym and what,

3261
01:18:43,111 --> 01:18:43,470
when,

3262
01:18:43,470 --> 01:18:45,600
what was the feeling when
you did your first mountain?

3263
01:18:46,170 --> 01:18:50,340
You mean like big outdoor climbing and
she was like going from doing it in the

3264
01:18:50,341 --> 01:18:52,230
gym to going to a mountain and you know,

3265
01:18:52,231 --> 01:18:52,900
in climate.

3266
01:18:52,900 --> 01:18:54,240
I mean honestly the first,

3267
01:18:54,300 --> 01:18:57,030
the first time climbing outside I liked
didn't like it as much cause it was

3268
01:18:57,031 --> 01:18:57,211
like,

3269
01:18:57,211 --> 01:18:58,800
oh how do you find the holds and all that,

3270
01:18:58,801 --> 01:18:58,991
you know,

3271
01:18:58,991 --> 01:18:59,641
like how do you do it?

3272
01:18:59,641 --> 01:19:01,230
Cause it's like different sports really.

3273
01:19:01,231 --> 01:19:02,064
I didn't know how to do it.

3274
01:19:02,430 --> 01:19:04,290
But then as I've learned
and as I got more into it,

3275
01:19:04,291 --> 01:19:07,230
you start to appreciate and you're
certainly in a more beautiful location,

3276
01:19:07,231 --> 01:19:07,441
you know?

3277
01:19:07,441 --> 01:19:08,340
That's kind of the main thing.

3278
01:19:08,730 --> 01:19:11,910
Does it give you a different sense of
accomplishment is what I was trying to get

3279
01:19:11,911 --> 01:19:12,080
at?

3280
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:12,220
Yeah,

3281
01:19:12,220 --> 01:19:12,571
for sure.

3282
01:19:12,571 --> 01:19:13,440
It just feels different,

3283
01:19:13,441 --> 01:19:13,561
right?

3284
01:19:13,561 --> 01:19:13,681
Yeah.

3285
01:19:13,681 --> 01:19:16,230
I mean when you get to the top
of something in the gym yet,

3286
01:19:16,460 --> 01:19:18,660
you know there's some satisfaction
in the physical achievement.

3287
01:19:18,661 --> 01:19:18,930
You're like,

3288
01:19:18,930 --> 01:19:19,111
oh,

3289
01:19:19,111 --> 01:19:20,270
I'm stronger than I used to be.

3290
01:19:20,271 --> 01:19:21,690
Or I learned how to do some technique.

3291
01:19:21,960 --> 01:19:23,640
But like when you get to the
top of something outside,

3292
01:19:23,641 --> 01:19:23,970
you're like,

3293
01:19:23,970 --> 01:19:24,900
that was rad.

3294
01:19:24,990 --> 01:19:25,261
You know,

3295
01:19:25,261 --> 01:19:26,850
like this is a worthy objective,

3296
01:19:26,851 --> 01:19:27,181
whatever.

3297
01:19:27,181 --> 01:19:28,014
It's like inherently,

3298
01:19:28,020 --> 01:19:28,320
you know,

3299
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:29,340
it has more inherent in eating.

3300
01:19:29,970 --> 01:19:32,160
One of the things I saw
on the 60 minutes thing,

3301
01:19:32,161 --> 01:19:33,810
so they asked you to hold up your fingers.

3302
01:19:34,230 --> 01:19:34,980
You have a,

3303
01:19:34,980 --> 01:19:36,660
you have really big like fat fingers.

3304
01:19:36,661 --> 01:19:37,494
Right.

3305
01:19:37,680 --> 01:19:41,040
That's know from just climbing
and clawing at things.

3306
01:19:41,070 --> 01:19:41,220
Yeah.

3307
01:19:41,220 --> 01:19:43,950
I think it was maybe from climbing
cracks where you put them in a wedge and

3308
01:19:43,951 --> 01:19:44,790
Torque on them and stuff.

3309
01:19:45,030 --> 01:19:48,510
Did you have to condition your hands
in any way or did it just happen?

3310
01:19:50,070 --> 01:19:51,490
This is 17 years of climbing,

3311
01:19:51,491 --> 01:19:52,110
you know?

3312
01:19:52,110 --> 01:19:53,610
Well that's what you need to tell girls.

3313
01:19:53,840 --> 01:19:57,270
Like girls need to know that if they
know about his hands and his strong

3314
01:19:57,271 --> 01:19:58,080
fingers.

3315
01:19:58,080 --> 01:19:59,640
Do you think that means
that he is a strong deck?

3316
01:19:59,660 --> 01:20:00,391
Is that what I'm saying?

3317
01:20:00,391 --> 01:20:01,680
That he's really highly powerful

3318
01:20:02,220 --> 01:20:03,020
as many years.

3319
01:20:03,020 --> 01:20:03,540
What's that?

3320
01:20:03,540 --> 01:20:04,660
I have a condition for this

3321
01:20:07,050 --> 01:20:08,280
helps you wedge in the cracks.

3322
01:20:08,600 --> 01:20:09,480
Yeah.

3323
01:20:10,140 --> 01:20:10,950
Yeah.

3324
01:20:10,950 --> 01:20:11,191
Yeah.

3325
01:20:11,191 --> 01:20:11,781
So you,

3326
01:20:11,781 --> 01:20:15,570
you have to like at some point in some
time where you're literally getting like

3327
01:20:15,571 --> 01:20:18,210
two inches of your fingers
in a crack or less.

3328
01:20:18,211 --> 01:20:18,600
I mean,

3329
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:19,433
less evil.

3330
01:20:19,800 --> 01:20:22,180
What's the smallest amount that
you're actually holding your body?

3331
01:20:23,120 --> 01:20:23,953
An inch.

3332
01:20:24,350 --> 01:20:26,850
I mean the just like
half of your last pad.

3333
01:20:26,970 --> 01:20:27,890
So half of the day.

3334
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:30,433
Yeah.

3335
01:20:30,940 --> 01:20:31,291
And that's,

3336
01:20:31,291 --> 01:20:32,640
you're holding your whole body up.

3337
01:20:32,850 --> 01:20:33,061
Well,

3338
01:20:33,061 --> 01:20:33,301
I mean,

3339
01:20:33,301 --> 01:20:34,590
you have your feet on things too.

3340
01:20:34,820 --> 01:20:35,161
You know,

3341
01:20:35,161 --> 01:20:35,881
probably really,

3342
01:20:35,881 --> 01:20:36,720
really small things.

3343
01:20:36,721 --> 01:20:39,270
But Jesus Christ,

3344
01:20:39,510 --> 01:20:39,751
I mean,

3345
01:20:39,751 --> 01:20:40,051
it can't be,

3346
01:20:40,051 --> 01:20:40,541
I mean that,

3347
01:20:40,541 --> 01:20:41,820
that would be like when it's really hard,

3348
01:20:42,360 --> 01:20:42,571
you know,

3349
01:20:42,571 --> 01:20:43,231
best case scenario,

3350
01:20:43,231 --> 01:20:44,640
you have your whole hand sunk in,

3351
01:20:44,641 --> 01:20:44,881
you know,

3352
01:20:44,881 --> 01:20:49,410
and it's like attached to
the mouse grip like cracks,

3353
01:20:49,411 --> 01:20:53,160
the most difficult thing to navigate no
cracks or actually like the most secure

3354
01:20:53,161 --> 01:20:54,440
thing to navigate really is a,

3355
01:20:54,750 --> 01:20:57,630
because once you put your fingers
in or your hand in you can,

3356
01:20:57,631 --> 01:20:58,110
uh,

3357
01:20:58,110 --> 01:20:59,820
so like if you put your hand into a crack,

3358
01:21:00,090 --> 01:21:03,610
you move your thumb down and gets fatter
and then it wedges and shape like a

3359
01:21:03,611 --> 01:21:04,020
sort of,

3360
01:21:04,020 --> 01:21:05,210
sort of like a camming device.

3361
01:21:05,220 --> 01:21:07,770
Like I was talking and you just make your
hand fatter and then it gets locked in

3362
01:21:07,771 --> 01:21:08,550
place.

3363
01:21:08,550 --> 01:21:10,200
And so once you have your
hand locked in like that,

3364
01:21:10,201 --> 01:21:10,411
I mean,

3365
01:21:10,411 --> 01:21:11,244
you could just,

3366
01:21:11,610 --> 01:21:11,880
you know,

3367
01:21:11,880 --> 01:21:12,240
I mean,

3368
01:21:12,240 --> 01:21:13,021
you just hang off.

3369
01:21:13,021 --> 01:21:13,530
I'm like,

3370
01:21:13,530 --> 01:21:13,681
yeah,

3371
01:21:13,681 --> 01:21:13,951
exactly.

3372
01:21:13,951 --> 01:21:14,784
You Shit your pants.

3373
01:21:14,820 --> 01:21:15,653
Totally fine.

3374
01:21:16,200 --> 01:21:18,150
But so like when I'm climbing a hand jams,

3375
01:21:18,151 --> 01:21:20,490
like it feels like I'm
walking or something,

3376
01:21:20,520 --> 01:21:20,761
you know,

3377
01:21:20,761 --> 01:21:21,594
I'm just like,

3378
01:21:21,610 --> 01:21:22,070
you know,

3379
01:21:22,070 --> 01:21:22,710
I can climb.

3380
01:21:22,710 --> 01:21:22,891
Well,

3381
01:21:22,891 --> 01:21:26,430
I have climbed thousands and thousands
of feet of hand jams like with no,

3382
01:21:26,460 --> 01:21:26,731
you know,

3383
01:21:26,731 --> 01:21:27,564
just whatever.

3384
01:21:27,990 --> 01:21:28,650
Nope.

3385
01:21:28,650 --> 01:21:30,420
You've been doing this for 17 years.

3386
01:21:30,720 --> 01:21:32,250
What keeps you doing this?

3387
01:21:32,370 --> 01:21:34,510
What is just rad?

3388
01:21:35,060 --> 01:21:35,893
Awesome.

3389
01:21:35,970 --> 01:21:36,550
I mean after,

3390
01:21:36,550 --> 01:21:37,141
as soon as we're done,

3391
01:21:37,141 --> 01:21:41,070
I'm driving to Vegas to go climbing
again and then I'm flying to Mexico in a

3392
01:21:41,070 --> 01:21:42,210
couple of days for like
a month road trip thing.

3393
01:21:42,570 --> 01:21:44,700
And when you're doing a lot of these,

3394
01:21:44,701 --> 01:21:46,110
you're doing them just by yourself.

3395
01:21:46,140 --> 01:21:46,891
You just pulling up,

3396
01:21:46,891 --> 01:21:48,120
showing up and climbing.

3397
01:21:49,380 --> 01:21:50,120
I wouldn't say,

3398
01:21:50,120 --> 01:21:51,990
I mean the big soul is the
stuff that you've seen.

3399
01:21:51,991 --> 01:21:54,870
I mean I maybe do like four
or five days like that a year.

3400
01:21:55,310 --> 01:21:55,950
Okay.

3401
01:21:55,950 --> 01:21:57,360
Those are so that you're doing with ropes?

3402
01:21:57,680 --> 01:21:58,131
Yeah,

3403
01:21:58,131 --> 01:22:00,930
I climb with a partner in
a rope 99% of the time.

3404
01:22:01,170 --> 01:22:02,010
And then you know,

3405
01:22:02,160 --> 01:22:05,430
the videos and stuff that you've seen
or like the playoffs and the super bowl

3406
01:22:05,431 --> 01:22:05,700
of,

3407
01:22:05,700 --> 01:22:06,450
of climbing,

3408
01:22:06,450 --> 01:22:06,781
you know,

3409
01:22:06,781 --> 01:22:08,880
but you're not seeing all the
practice and all the like,

3410
01:22:08,970 --> 01:22:09,241
you know,

3411
01:22:09,241 --> 01:22:11,540
the years that go into like
getting ready for the Superbowl.

3412
01:22:11,990 --> 01:22:12,930
Oh Wow.

3413
01:22:13,020 --> 01:22:13,920
So for you,

3414
01:22:13,921 --> 01:22:15,390
it's just a thrilling,

3415
01:22:15,391 --> 01:22:17,910
fun thing to do and it
hasn't lost any of its charm.

3416
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:19,140
I mean,

3417
01:22:19,140 --> 01:22:20,370
the charm has transitioned.

3418
01:22:20,371 --> 01:22:21,330
I think as I get older,

3419
01:22:21,360 --> 01:22:23,070
like now I love the travel more and like,

3420
01:22:23,300 --> 01:22:23,460
you know,

3421
01:22:23,460 --> 01:22:26,310
I'm pretty excited about going to Mexico
and traveling around and like seeing

3422
01:22:26,311 --> 01:22:27,240
new places and all that,

3423
01:22:27,660 --> 01:22:27,900
you know.

3424
01:22:27,900 --> 01:22:28,681
Whereas when I was younger,

3425
01:22:28,681 --> 01:22:31,620
it was just a matter of like trying to
do physically do hard news and being

3426
01:22:31,621 --> 01:22:31,830
like,

3427
01:22:31,830 --> 01:22:32,041
oh,

3428
01:22:32,041 --> 01:22:35,370
I can do whatever this boulder
problem that I couldn't do before.

3429
01:22:35,371 --> 01:22:35,971
And you know,

3430
01:22:35,971 --> 01:22:37,140
it was like seeing that growth.

3431
01:22:37,530 --> 01:22:38,250
Now I'm kind of like,

3432
01:22:38,250 --> 01:22:38,641
ah,

3433
01:22:38,641 --> 01:22:38,911
you know,

3434
01:22:38,911 --> 01:22:41,730
there's always somebody who's going to
be stronger and better and whatever.

3435
01:22:41,731 --> 01:22:43,540
Like it doesn't really matter
how hard the moves are announced,

3436
01:22:43,541 --> 01:22:46,890
the cooler for me to go to like cool
places and climb new things and all that.

3437
01:22:46,980 --> 01:22:47,813
But you know what I mean?

3438
01:22:47,850 --> 01:22:48,750
I still love climbing.

3439
01:22:49,740 --> 01:22:50,250
No.

3440
01:22:50,250 --> 01:22:55,250
What is your life like now in terms of
like media obligations and how much,

3441
01:22:55,320 --> 01:22:56,850
how much of that stuff has changed?

3442
01:22:57,050 --> 01:22:57,610
Um,

3443
01:22:57,610 --> 01:23:01,170
I mean six since 60 minutes and it's
obviously kind of blown up quite a bit.

3444
01:23:01,790 --> 01:23:02,623
Um,

3445
01:23:02,760 --> 01:23:02,971
yeah,

3446
01:23:02,971 --> 01:23:05,250
I'm juggling a lot more
like speaking opportunities,

3447
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:05,760
you know,

3448
01:23:05,760 --> 01:23:06,750
I mean stuff like this where I'm like,

3449
01:23:06,751 --> 01:23:07,221
oh cool,

3450
01:23:07,221 --> 01:23:09,210
I'll check out something new and
like see what it's all about.

3451
01:23:09,660 --> 01:23:10,200
Um,

3452
01:23:10,200 --> 01:23:12,870
but he did this cause for folks listening,

3453
01:23:12,871 --> 01:23:15,660
he had no idea what the podcast
was and never listened to it.

3454
01:23:16,350 --> 01:23:20,430
Just had been know just hounded
by people online that I was like,

3455
01:23:20,431 --> 01:23:20,701
wow,

3456
01:23:20,701 --> 01:23:20,941
I'm here.

3457
01:23:20,941 --> 01:23:21,774
It must be cool.

3458
01:23:21,800 --> 01:23:23,430
But then also like my
best friend lives in La,

3459
01:23:23,431 --> 01:23:23,791
so I was like,

3460
01:23:23,791 --> 01:23:23,941
oh,

3461
01:23:23,941 --> 01:23:24,421
it works out.

3462
01:23:24,421 --> 01:23:24,601
You know,

3463
01:23:24,601 --> 01:23:25,740
I'm just kind of put them together.

3464
01:23:26,010 --> 01:23:29,070
That's kind of how I tried to
do all my media slash you know,

3465
01:23:29,071 --> 01:23:30,300
whatever those kinds of obligations.

3466
01:23:30,301 --> 01:23:33,510
I try to lump it into what I'm already
doing or like make it fit right.

3467
01:23:33,860 --> 01:23:34,381
It seems to work.

3468
01:23:34,381 --> 01:23:34,710
All right.

3469
01:23:34,710 --> 01:23:35,910
Do you still live in that van?

3470
01:23:36,210 --> 01:23:36,361
Yeah,

3471
01:23:36,361 --> 01:23:39,930
I mean it's parked out front but wow.

3472
01:23:39,960 --> 01:23:43,040
But now I'm probably overseas like half
the year and so then I just leave the

3473
01:23:43,050 --> 01:23:44,320
van parked somewhere and you know,

3474
01:23:44,600 --> 01:23:45,540
camp or do whatever.

3475
01:23:46,200 --> 01:23:46,590
Um,

3476
01:23:46,590 --> 01:23:51,390
now like when you live in a van w do
you just like a shower at a gym or

3477
01:23:51,391 --> 01:23:51,721
something?

3478
01:23:51,721 --> 01:23:52,261
Like what do you do?

3479
01:23:52,261 --> 01:23:53,460
Or River or never?

3480
01:23:54,740 --> 01:23:54,900
Yeah.

3481
01:23:54,900 --> 01:23:55,081
Well,

3482
01:23:55,081 --> 01:23:55,270
I mean,

3483
01:23:55,270 --> 01:23:55,930
whatever.

3484
01:23:55,930 --> 01:23:56,340
Yeah,

3485
01:23:56,340 --> 01:23:57,420
you just make it work.

3486
01:23:57,780 --> 01:23:58,021
I mean,

3487
01:23:58,021 --> 01:23:59,550
oftentimes are like,

3488
01:23:59,580 --> 01:24:01,740
so I'm going to Vegas
and I'll be in the van,

3489
01:24:01,770 --> 01:24:02,520
but um,

3490
01:24:02,520 --> 01:24:02,731
I mean,

3491
01:24:02,731 --> 01:24:04,030
I'll be staying at one
of my friend's houses,

3492
01:24:04,060 --> 01:24:04,460
probably.

3493
01:24:04,460 --> 01:24:05,900
I would probably be sleeping in the band,

3494
01:24:05,901 --> 01:24:06,860
but I can use this house.

3495
01:24:06,890 --> 01:24:08,070
You can use the kitchen if I want,

3496
01:24:08,071 --> 01:24:08,904
whatever,

3497
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:09,570
you know,

3498
01:24:09,570 --> 01:24:12,090
so everything you own every year,

3499
01:24:12,120 --> 01:24:14,370
your whole life is in a van mostly.

3500
01:24:14,371 --> 01:24:15,000
I mean,

3501
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:18,360
my mom's house in Sacramento has like
some other random piles of stuff in it,

3502
01:24:18,840 --> 01:24:19,081
you know,

3503
01:24:19,081 --> 01:24:22,200
like camping gear that I knew
that I wouldn't need on this trip.

3504
01:24:22,201 --> 01:24:22,381
You know,

3505
01:24:22,381 --> 01:24:23,370
I just leave it at mom's house.

3506
01:24:23,970 --> 01:24:24,803
Wow.

3507
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:25,110
Yeah.

3508
01:24:25,110 --> 01:24:25,381
Do you,

3509
01:24:25,381 --> 01:24:26,011
do you ever like,

3510
01:24:26,011 --> 01:24:26,191
say,

3511
01:24:26,191 --> 01:24:26,461
man,

3512
01:24:26,461 --> 01:24:27,690
I got to get a fucking apartment?

3513
01:24:27,990 --> 01:24:28,410
No,

3514
01:24:28,410 --> 01:24:29,071
definitely not.

3515
01:24:29,071 --> 01:24:29,191
Like,

3516
01:24:29,191 --> 01:24:31,770
why would you pay rent for a
place that you don't ever go to?

3517
01:24:32,420 --> 01:24:32,760
Well,

3518
01:24:32,760 --> 01:24:35,460
a lot of people they go
and they lie down in a bed.

3519
01:24:38,530 --> 01:24:40,020
Aye.

3520
01:24:40,660 --> 01:24:44,170
I'm just saying they're pussies with
their silly bed while you're camping on a

3521
01:24:44,171 --> 01:24:45,004
ledge.

3522
01:24:45,010 --> 01:24:46,420
I sleep really well on the van though.

3523
01:24:46,421 --> 01:24:47,140
Honestly it's so,

3524
01:24:47,140 --> 01:24:47,590
you know,

3525
01:24:47,590 --> 01:24:49,450
the end of my sleeping
bag and I'm just like out.

3526
01:24:49,660 --> 01:24:50,560
How do you know where to go?

3527
01:24:50,561 --> 01:24:51,340
Do you have like,

3528
01:24:51,340 --> 01:24:52,570
like when you come to a new town,

3529
01:24:52,571 --> 01:24:54,130
do you have to find a good parking spot?

3530
01:24:54,190 --> 01:24:54,461
Yeah,

3531
01:24:54,461 --> 01:24:55,540
I mean it takes a little dune.

3532
01:24:55,630 --> 01:24:56,800
You sorta get the hang of it.

3533
01:24:56,950 --> 01:25:00,760
I mean like a suburban streets
that don't seem to like,

3534
01:25:01,060 --> 01:25:03,130
I mean basically if you see
a van parked for a night,

3535
01:25:04,380 --> 01:25:05,710
someone that's totally normal.

3536
01:25:05,711 --> 01:25:08,590
You've got a friend and then a 24
hour grocery stores are always fine.

3537
01:25:08,591 --> 01:25:09,130
Like,

3538
01:25:09,130 --> 01:25:09,430
you know,

3539
01:25:09,430 --> 01:25:10,151
gas stations,

3540
01:25:10,151 --> 01:25:10,930
whatever,

3541
01:25:10,930 --> 01:25:11,621
rest areas.

3542
01:25:11,621 --> 01:25:12,790
Like do you ever get hassled?

3543
01:25:13,060 --> 01:25:13,241
Yeah,

3544
01:25:13,241 --> 01:25:13,631
I mean I've,

3545
01:25:13,631 --> 01:25:15,400
I've had a lot of cops like check in,

3546
01:25:15,430 --> 01:25:15,821
you know,

3547
01:25:15,821 --> 01:25:18,910
and like make sure the car is not stolen
or like wake up and see a cop behind

3548
01:25:18,911 --> 01:25:19,001
you,

3549
01:25:19,001 --> 01:25:19,811
like running your plates,

3550
01:25:19,811 --> 01:25:21,730
but then they just peace out
when they see it's not stolen.

3551
01:25:22,090 --> 01:25:22,923
Things like that.

3552
01:25:23,090 --> 01:25:24,250
You have ever COPCO dude,

3553
01:25:24,310 --> 01:25:25,143
I'm a big fan.

3554
01:25:25,690 --> 01:25:27,310
Can You oh actually it actually,

3555
01:25:27,311 --> 01:25:27,560
yeah.

3556
01:25:27,560 --> 01:25:28,830
Actually I have but uh,

3557
01:25:28,831 --> 01:25:30,640
only in like a little
climbing town in Utah.

3558
01:25:31,260 --> 01:25:32,080
Downtown.

3559
01:25:32,080 --> 01:25:32,290
Yeah.

3560
01:25:32,290 --> 01:25:34,460
Actually how everybody called my lab.

3561
01:25:34,610 --> 01:25:35,380
Do you know my lab?

3562
01:25:35,380 --> 01:25:36,760
It's like a huge mountain biking area,

3563
01:25:36,790 --> 01:25:38,590
but it's like the heart of the word,

3564
01:25:38,980 --> 01:25:41,170
but I don't know what could calls it
from the Old Testament if you've been

3565
01:25:41,171 --> 01:25:41,911
reading a lot of,

3566
01:25:41,911 --> 01:25:42,580
uh,

3567
01:25:42,580 --> 01:25:42,821
you know,

3568
01:25:42,821 --> 01:25:43,240
old tests.

3569
01:25:43,240 --> 01:25:43,391
No,

3570
01:25:43,391 --> 01:25:44,051
I mean I'm hurting.

3571
01:25:44,051 --> 01:25:45,860
Is it like an actual geographic location?

3572
01:25:45,870 --> 01:25:46,300
Yeah,

3573
01:25:46,300 --> 01:25:48,130
I was actually in
California for some reason.

3574
01:25:48,131 --> 01:25:48,281
You know,

3575
01:25:48,281 --> 01:25:48,671
it's like,

3576
01:25:48,671 --> 01:25:48,940
yeah,

3577
01:25:48,940 --> 01:25:50,230
way eastern Utah,

3578
01:25:50,231 --> 01:25:51,490
like right by the border with Colorado.

3579
01:25:51,491 --> 01:25:52,031
It's really cool.

3580
01:25:52,031 --> 01:25:54,910
It's the red sandstone desert where you
see like arches and like really pretty.

3581
01:25:54,911 --> 01:25:58,210
Like I was crazy things that are just
carved because of the wind in the road.

3582
01:25:58,210 --> 01:25:58,331
Yeah,

3583
01:25:58,331 --> 01:25:58,751
exactly.

3584
01:25:58,751 --> 01:25:59,250
Exactly.

3585
01:25:59,250 --> 01:25:59,471
Oh,

3586
01:25:59,471 --> 01:26:00,690
that is so bizarre.

3587
01:26:00,691 --> 01:26:01,840
It's really pretty landscape.

3588
01:26:01,930 --> 01:26:05,480
You must see like some of the coolest
spots in the world when it comes to,

3589
01:26:05,660 --> 01:26:06,170
you know,

3590
01:26:06,170 --> 01:26:07,150
all these climbs here.

3591
01:26:07,160 --> 01:26:07,551
For sure.

3592
01:26:07,551 --> 01:26:07,970
That's like,

3593
01:26:07,970 --> 01:26:10,850
that's what I'm saying that like that
is becoming more of the appeal for me.

3594
01:26:10,851 --> 01:26:11,031
You know,

3595
01:26:11,031 --> 01:26:13,790
just to go to these amazing
places and climb like cool things.

3596
01:26:14,180 --> 01:26:14,361
Yeah.

3597
01:26:14,361 --> 01:26:16,340
For folks who've never seen nothing
on what we were talking about,

3598
01:26:16,341 --> 01:26:17,810
the sound somehow or another,

3599
01:26:18,050 --> 01:26:19,640
the rock eroded to look.

3600
01:26:19,900 --> 01:26:22,930
It looks like it was constructed
like a freestanding art.

3601
01:26:23,100 --> 01:26:23,600
Yeah.

3602
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:25,400
Crazy arch may not have stone.

3603
01:26:25,480 --> 01:26:29,600
It just shows you that although the
randomness of nature with the weird things

3604
01:26:29,601 --> 01:26:30,434
that can occur,

3605
01:26:30,710 --> 01:26:34,640
I went on a northface expedition to Chad
in the dead center of Africa to climb

3606
01:26:34,700 --> 01:26:38,210
unclimbed sandstone and towers and arches
like exactly what we're talking about

3607
01:26:38,211 --> 01:26:39,530
in Utah except it was and Chad,

3608
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:43,070
why we drove across blank empty desert,

3609
01:26:43,130 --> 01:26:45,260
like just completely
flat sand with no road,

3610
01:26:45,290 --> 01:26:48,770
just driving gps for three days across
like flat nothingness until we got to

3611
01:26:48,771 --> 01:26:49,670
these crazy towers.

3612
01:26:49,700 --> 01:26:50,533
Oh my God,

3613
01:26:50,740 --> 01:26:54,860
you guys are driving for three days
through the desert is out of control.

3614
01:26:55,670 --> 01:26:56,451
She drove,

3615
01:26:56,451 --> 01:26:57,530
we drove for two days,

3616
01:26:57,590 --> 01:26:58,560
just flat and knocked me.

3617
01:26:58,561 --> 01:27:00,290
And so you don't see
anything in any direction,

3618
01:27:00,390 --> 01:27:02,060
so much gas to drive that long.

3619
01:27:02,330 --> 01:27:02,601
I don't know.

3620
01:27:02,601 --> 01:27:03,750
We had this outfit or just,

3621
01:27:03,980 --> 01:27:04,251
you know,

3622
01:27:04,251 --> 01:27:05,084
that's what he does.

3623
01:27:06,590 --> 01:27:07,640
I think he knew how to do it,

3624
01:27:07,641 --> 01:27:08,474
you know,

3625
01:27:08,650 --> 01:27:13,130
but the day's drive well but driving it
like 27 miles an hour through the sand.

3626
01:27:13,160 --> 01:27:13,341
Yeah,

3627
01:27:13,341 --> 01:27:16,490
because you're driving across like it'd
be like going to the Mojave desert and

3628
01:27:16,491 --> 01:27:20,360
it's driving cross country completely
straight for three days anyway.

3629
01:27:20,361 --> 01:27:23,300
But so after two days we randomly passed
these two dudes on camels that were

3630
01:27:23,301 --> 01:27:24,134
doing the same thing.

3631
01:27:24,500 --> 01:27:26,750
They were just questioning across
the desert on their camels.

3632
01:27:27,020 --> 01:27:27,801
Randomly,

3633
01:27:27,801 --> 01:27:28,840
randomly rated on the,

3634
01:27:28,850 --> 01:27:30,770
I'm sure they were like
going to trade or something.

3635
01:27:30,770 --> 01:27:30,921
Yeah,

3636
01:27:30,921 --> 01:27:31,754
we just was,

3637
01:27:31,760 --> 01:27:33,140
is there a path you are on?

3638
01:27:33,320 --> 01:27:34,400
That's the thing is we were just,

3639
01:27:34,401 --> 01:27:36,140
we were following gps
coordinates across it.

3640
01:27:36,290 --> 01:27:37,160
The Virgin desert,

3641
01:27:37,250 --> 01:27:38,083
you know,

3642
01:27:38,180 --> 01:27:38,751
it was like,

3643
01:27:38,751 --> 01:27:40,100
it was kind of out of control.

3644
01:27:40,340 --> 01:27:40,881
We were like,

3645
01:27:40,881 --> 01:27:43,250
what the fuck are these
guys doing out here?

3646
01:27:43,490 --> 01:27:43,731
Why?

3647
01:27:43,731 --> 01:27:44,001
You know,

3648
01:27:44,001 --> 01:27:44,630
and like,

3649
01:27:44,630 --> 01:27:45,463
yeah,

3650
01:27:45,870 --> 01:27:46,790
who were the guys?

3651
01:27:46,820 --> 01:27:48,260
They're just like desert nomad dudes.

3652
01:27:48,261 --> 01:27:48,501
You know,

3653
01:27:48,501 --> 01:27:49,640
just like indigenous folks.

3654
01:27:50,780 --> 01:27:53,000
I mean they were just normal
dudes on their normal life,

3655
01:27:53,030 --> 01:27:53,661
but you're just like,

3656
01:27:53,661 --> 01:27:55,310
it's hard to believe that
that's their normal life.

3657
01:27:55,311 --> 01:27:58,730
Just like taking a camel for five days
across the blank desert with no food or

3658
01:27:58,731 --> 01:27:59,564
water.

3659
01:27:59,600 --> 01:28:02,470
It's hard to wrap your head around the
fact that that's how people lived for a

3660
01:28:02,550 --> 01:28:03,380
long,

3661
01:28:03,380 --> 01:28:04,400
that's how people still live.

3662
01:28:04,401 --> 01:28:05,870
That's what's so crazy
about going to chat.

3663
01:28:05,871 --> 01:28:06,920
It's like we were meeting,

3664
01:28:07,020 --> 01:28:07,790
you know,

3665
01:28:07,790 --> 01:28:10,640
people that live there that like in their
entire life will probably never touch

3666
01:28:10,641 --> 01:28:11,900
pavement or like asphalt,

3667
01:28:11,901 --> 01:28:12,051
you know,

3668
01:28:12,051 --> 01:28:13,760
they just live in sand and that's it.

3669
01:28:13,820 --> 01:28:15,380
But for all of existence,

3670
01:28:15,490 --> 01:28:15,860
they just,

3671
01:28:15,860 --> 01:28:17,010
gender goats 10 there,

3672
01:28:17,080 --> 01:28:20,030
they're a little donkeys and
stuff and you're just like,

3673
01:28:20,031 --> 01:28:20,870
oh my God,

3674
01:28:21,440 --> 01:28:23,330
it's pretty hardcore and that,

3675
01:28:23,331 --> 01:28:26,210
and that's why I like the
travel experiences are
becoming more important to me

3676
01:28:26,211 --> 01:28:27,380
than the actual climate sort of.

3677
01:28:27,770 --> 01:28:28,041
Yeah,

3678
01:28:28,041 --> 01:28:28,671
I would imagine.

3679
01:28:28,671 --> 01:28:31,040
But that's a really paradigm shifting.

3680
01:28:31,041 --> 01:28:31,181
Yeah,

3681
01:28:31,181 --> 01:28:32,060
it's pretty heavy stuff.

3682
01:28:32,061 --> 01:28:32,271
You know,

3683
01:28:32,271 --> 01:28:33,104
you're like,

3684
01:28:33,480 --> 01:28:34,313
whoa,

3685
01:28:35,890 --> 01:28:37,250
holy deed man.

3686
01:28:37,310 --> 01:28:40,460
Three days driving on virgin desert,

3687
01:28:41,270 --> 01:28:42,230
nothing to the left,

3688
01:28:42,231 --> 01:28:43,120
nothing to the right.

3689
01:28:43,140 --> 01:28:44,780
Nothing in front of you in the morning.

3690
01:28:44,840 --> 01:28:46,220
So we would drive until we got tired,

3691
01:28:46,221 --> 01:28:46,701
we'd park,

3692
01:28:46,701 --> 01:28:47,361
we'd do dinner,

3693
01:28:47,361 --> 01:28:48,194
we'd go to bed.

3694
01:28:48,350 --> 01:28:50,030
And then in the morning when
you got to go take a poop,

3695
01:28:50,780 --> 01:28:53,330
I mean there's no cover in any
direction because it's just flat.

3696
01:28:53,360 --> 01:28:56,960
So you'd basically just walk in any
direction until everyone else got really

3697
01:28:56,961 --> 01:28:59,330
small and then you would just take
a poo and then you just walked back.

3698
01:28:59,830 --> 01:29:00,471
Because there was no,

3699
01:29:00,471 --> 01:29:00,681
you know,

3700
01:29:00,681 --> 01:29:01,081
it's not like,

3701
01:29:01,081 --> 01:29:02,340
oh I'm going to go behind that tree.

3702
01:29:02,370 --> 01:29:03,390
Is that you just have to walk though.

3703
01:29:03,391 --> 01:29:04,190
People are small.

3704
01:29:04,190 --> 01:29:05,340
You take photos of this.

3705
01:29:05,430 --> 01:29:05,671
Yeah,

3706
01:29:05,671 --> 01:29:06,240
I mean it's all,

3707
01:29:06,240 --> 01:29:06,421
yeah,

3708
01:29:06,421 --> 01:29:07,254
it's all professional.

3709
01:29:07,350 --> 01:29:08,490
I didn't take quite as much,

3710
01:29:08,491 --> 01:29:10,250
but it must've been no your poop.

3711
01:29:10,251 --> 01:29:15,251
Then I have photos of Brian Cowen pooping
when we a camping in Montana with a

3712
01:29:16,261 --> 01:29:17,130
little flag in it.

3713
01:29:17,160 --> 01:29:18,390
We were going to put it on Twitter.

3714
01:29:18,600 --> 01:29:19,110
That a,

3715
01:29:19,110 --> 01:29:19,831
if you could find it,

3716
01:29:19,831 --> 01:29:20,910
we'll give you 1000 bucks.

3717
01:29:21,360 --> 01:29:24,810
It's on the Missouri River and we were
going to give like rough coordinates.

3718
01:29:25,050 --> 01:29:26,100
Take a picture of yourself by,

3719
01:29:26,101 --> 01:29:27,120
we'll give you 1000 bucks,

3720
01:29:27,150 --> 01:29:29,460
but you can't just sleep poop tear.

3721
01:29:29,470 --> 01:29:31,400
You have to like put it in bio bag,

3722
01:29:31,630 --> 01:29:32,211
back down,

3723
01:29:32,211 --> 01:29:35,460
pack it out and human
poop is really gross.

3724
01:29:35,461 --> 01:29:36,840
Like if you run across like cows,

3725
01:29:36,841 --> 01:29:38,160
poop is a lot of cows out there.

3726
01:29:38,430 --> 01:29:38,861
Cow Poop.

3727
01:29:38,861 --> 01:29:39,694
It's kind of gross to,

3728
01:29:39,750 --> 01:29:40,441
it's kind of gross,

3729
01:29:40,441 --> 01:29:45,030
but it doesn't smell that bad difference
in human shit and cow shit is pretty

3730
01:29:45,031 --> 01:29:45,660
shocking.

3731
01:29:45,660 --> 01:29:45,960
No,

3732
01:29:45,960 --> 01:29:50,100
no cow shit also smells horrible until
it's been sitting there for like a year

3733
01:29:50,101 --> 01:29:51,210
and it's all baked by the sun.

3734
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:51,990
That too,

3735
01:29:51,990 --> 01:29:54,920
like what you're talking about is like
fried cow pies that are all dead and like

3736
01:29:54,930 --> 01:29:55,571
sterilized,

3737
01:29:55,571 --> 01:29:55,720
you know?

3738
01:29:55,720 --> 01:29:55,860
Yeah.

3739
01:29:55,860 --> 01:29:56,611
But I've been around,

3740
01:29:56,611 --> 01:29:59,850
but the actual cow taking a shit
and they can't fuck with a human.

3741
01:30:00,270 --> 01:30:00,661
I Dunno.

3742
01:30:00,661 --> 01:30:01,590
But it depends.

3743
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:02,610
It depends on the,

3744
01:30:02,611 --> 01:30:03,550
depends on burgers.

3745
01:30:03,990 --> 01:30:04,141
Yeah,

3746
01:30:04,141 --> 01:30:04,591
exactly.

3747
01:30:04,591 --> 01:30:04,941
Yeah.

3748
01:30:04,941 --> 01:30:09,300
Just shitting out cheeseburgers and
whiskey that he just goes to show you guys

3749
01:30:09,301 --> 01:30:10,650
do to work on your diet a little bit.

3750
01:30:11,310 --> 01:30:12,210
That's not made.

3751
01:30:12,270 --> 01:30:13,610
I'm saying some other dude,

3752
01:30:13,740 --> 01:30:15,150
it was some random dude just shit.

3753
01:30:15,151 --> 01:30:15,870
And we're grading it.

3754
01:30:15,870 --> 01:30:16,800
That's what you're talking about.

3755
01:30:18,210 --> 01:30:18,631
But uh,

3756
01:30:18,631 --> 01:30:18,901
yeah,

3757
01:30:18,901 --> 01:30:21,810
you can't just leave your shit
out there in the Missouri,

3758
01:30:21,930 --> 01:30:22,950
but you can't in the desert.

3759
01:30:24,150 --> 01:30:26,510
Did you encounter any animals
while you were doing this?

3760
01:30:26,810 --> 01:30:27,080
Dry?

3761
01:30:27,080 --> 01:30:30,230
We saw tons of little things like
little desert foxes and stuff and um,

3762
01:30:30,300 --> 01:30:30,541
yeah,

3763
01:30:30,541 --> 01:30:30,721
like,

3764
01:30:30,721 --> 01:30:31,460
cause they'll type,

3765
01:30:31,460 --> 01:30:32,293
uh,

3766
01:30:32,390 --> 01:30:32,611
I don't know,

3767
01:30:32,611 --> 01:30:32,900
you know,

3768
01:30:32,900 --> 01:30:34,510
different antelopes and what are they,

3769
01:30:34,511 --> 01:30:34,650
uh,

3770
01:30:34,650 --> 01:30:35,131
eating out?

3771
01:30:35,131 --> 01:30:36,870
They're like tiny little shrubs.

3772
01:30:36,871 --> 01:30:37,081
I mean,

3773
01:30:37,081 --> 01:30:37,914
there were like,

3774
01:30:38,010 --> 01:30:38,221
you know,

3775
01:30:38,221 --> 01:30:40,650
there'd be a Bush every 600 yards,

3776
01:30:40,950 --> 01:30:41,461
you know what I mean?

3777
01:30:41,461 --> 01:30:42,090
Like,

3778
01:30:42,090 --> 01:30:45,450
I mean there is some vegetation but it's
just like flat sand with like a shrub

3779
01:30:45,840 --> 01:30:47,190
and then like a mile later you're like,

3780
01:30:47,191 --> 01:30:48,360
there's a little tiny tree,

3781
01:30:48,570 --> 01:30:48,841
you know?

3782
01:30:48,841 --> 01:30:49,950
And then whatever,

3783
01:30:50,520 --> 01:30:51,353
no snakes,

3784
01:30:51,360 --> 01:30:52,171
nothing like that.

3785
01:30:52,171 --> 01:30:55,090
That and not really know what
a strange ecosystem that is.

3786
01:30:55,470 --> 01:30:56,640
When we got to where we were going,

3787
01:30:56,641 --> 01:31:00,090
there were these amazing
stand stone towers and then
there was like more whether

3788
01:31:00,091 --> 01:31:03,060
there was more going on I think
because of this Phil cliffs and stuff.

3789
01:31:03,060 --> 01:31:05,160
So maybe it traps more
moisture or whatever.

3790
01:31:05,161 --> 01:31:05,730
So,

3791
01:31:05,730 --> 01:31:08,220
and there were more people living there
because there was more vegetation.

3792
01:31:08,760 --> 01:31:09,593
Um,

3793
01:31:09,810 --> 01:31:10,081
you know what,

3794
01:31:10,081 --> 01:31:11,310
I'm still pretty much desert.

3795
01:31:11,311 --> 01:31:11,460
Yeah.

3796
01:31:11,460 --> 01:31:12,810
I mean it's still full fledged desert,

3797
01:31:12,811 --> 01:31:14,040
but there were at least like shrubs,

3798
01:31:14,050 --> 01:31:15,870
kind of like the American
desert where you see,

3799
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:16,261
you know,

3800
01:31:16,261 --> 01:31:18,000
like the Mojave and how
they get their water,

3801
01:31:18,420 --> 01:31:19,530
their wells every once in a while.

3802
01:31:20,910 --> 01:31:21,211
I mean,

3803
01:31:21,211 --> 01:31:21,420
I,

3804
01:31:21,420 --> 01:31:22,200
I assume,

3805
01:31:22,200 --> 01:31:22,441
I mean,

3806
01:31:22,441 --> 01:31:23,880
there was water running underground,

3807
01:31:23,881 --> 01:31:24,181
I guess,

3808
01:31:24,181 --> 01:31:27,150
because you could see like bands of
vegetation that we're supposedly like

3809
01:31:27,151 --> 01:31:27,601
washes,

3810
01:31:27,601 --> 01:31:27,811
you know,

3811
01:31:27,811 --> 01:31:28,680
like an underground river.

3812
01:31:28,980 --> 01:31:30,810
So one of the real mind fucks about the,

3813
01:31:30,811 --> 01:31:30,991
uh,

3814
01:31:30,991 --> 01:31:35,250
the topography of this
world is how it's variable.

3815
01:31:35,570 --> 01:31:35,970
Yeah.

3816
01:31:35,970 --> 01:31:36,541
How are you different,

3817
01:31:36,541 --> 01:31:37,331
different parts of the world.

3818
01:31:37,331 --> 01:31:42,331
They're not just variable but variable
in the same location over time to Egypt

3819
01:31:43,200 --> 01:31:45,870
where the Nile Valley
was like 9,000 years ago.

3820
01:31:45,870 --> 01:31:46,730
That was a rain forest.

3821
01:31:46,810 --> 01:31:47,400
But yeah,

3822
01:31:47,400 --> 01:31:47,790
that's,

3823
01:31:47,790 --> 01:31:49,740
that's the exact same type of
area that I'm talking about.

3824
01:31:49,800 --> 01:31:50,341
So,

3825
01:31:50,341 --> 01:31:51,080
um,

3826
01:31:51,080 --> 01:31:51,571
and it actually,

3827
01:31:51,571 --> 01:31:52,021
so no,

3828
01:31:52,021 --> 01:31:52,561
while we were there,

3829
01:31:52,561 --> 01:31:53,101
it was rad.

3830
01:31:53,101 --> 01:31:55,440
We went into a cave and
the cave paintings and,

3831
01:31:55,441 --> 01:31:56,090
um,

3832
01:31:56,090 --> 01:31:56,581
and I mean,

3833
01:31:56,581 --> 01:31:57,414
it's all just,

3834
01:31:57,480 --> 01:31:57,691
you know,

3835
01:31:57,691 --> 01:31:58,650
we're in the middle of nowhere.

3836
01:31:58,860 --> 01:32:00,790
And so you could see the
stick figure drawings and,

3837
01:32:00,791 --> 01:32:01,330
uh,

3838
01:32:01,330 --> 01:32:03,820
and it showed like
these big herder people,

3839
01:32:03,850 --> 01:32:04,151
you know,

3840
01:32:04,151 --> 01:32:06,040
like drawings of dudes like tending their,

3841
01:32:06,220 --> 01:32:06,761
their big,

3842
01:32:06,761 --> 01:32:07,090
uh,

3843
01:32:07,090 --> 01:32:10,660
cows and then them being
displaced by the camel people,

3844
01:32:10,661 --> 01:32:12,130
like the people of the
desert and all that.

3845
01:32:12,220 --> 01:32:12,431
And,

3846
01:32:12,431 --> 01:32:12,730
um,

3847
01:32:12,730 --> 01:32:14,920
and our outfitter was telling us that
was kind of showing the history of the

3848
01:32:14,921 --> 01:32:16,420
whole area because like as the,

3849
01:32:16,450 --> 01:32:19,150
as the desert advanced and like
the grasslands and forests,

3850
01:32:19,151 --> 01:32:19,350
you know,

3851
01:32:19,350 --> 01:32:20,350
receded like,

3852
01:32:20,351 --> 01:32:22,000
so Chad now all the,

3853
01:32:22,001 --> 01:32:24,910
all the big cow people now live in like
southern southern Chad where they're

3854
01:32:24,911 --> 01:32:27,250
still like vegetation and the rest
of the country is just desert,

3855
01:32:27,280 --> 01:32:27,521
you know,

3856
01:32:27,521 --> 01:32:30,430
as the Sahara or whatever this
the hell has like moved south and

3857
01:32:30,880 --> 01:32:31,750
desertification,

3858
01:32:31,751 --> 01:32:32,584
all that kind of stuff.

3859
01:32:32,590 --> 01:32:34,840
It's a really strange thing
that happens to the climate.

3860
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:35,411
Yeah.

3861
01:32:35,411 --> 01:32:36,041
I mean it's pretty,

3862
01:32:36,041 --> 01:32:38,680
it's pretty interesting though to see
like cave paintings of like this whole

3863
01:32:38,681 --> 01:32:39,550
process of,

3864
01:32:39,640 --> 01:32:39,941
you know,

3865
01:32:39,941 --> 01:32:41,800
like different populations being,

3866
01:32:42,270 --> 01:32:42,490
you know,

3867
01:32:42,490 --> 01:32:43,270
replaced.

3868
01:32:43,270 --> 01:32:44,710
How many Ken's paintings do they know?

3869
01:32:44,950 --> 01:32:45,161
Well,

3870
01:32:45,161 --> 01:32:45,910
I mean,

3871
01:32:45,910 --> 01:32:46,270
yeah,

3872
01:32:46,270 --> 01:32:50,740
I think that the climate events are over
the last 10,000 years or whatever or

3873
01:32:50,741 --> 01:32:51,574
maybe even older.

3874
01:32:52,570 --> 01:32:52,990
Wow,

3875
01:32:52,990 --> 01:32:53,770
okay.

3876
01:32:53,770 --> 01:32:54,251
It was pretty,

3877
01:32:54,251 --> 01:32:55,510
I mean it was neat stuff for us.

3878
01:32:55,511 --> 01:32:56,030
We were like,

3879
01:32:56,030 --> 01:32:56,863
whoa.

3880
01:32:56,960 --> 01:32:57,793
Yeah,

3881
01:32:58,200 --> 01:33:00,440
it's really the key cave
paintings really freaked me out.

3882
01:33:00,470 --> 01:33:01,221
Have you ever seen that?

3883
01:33:01,221 --> 01:33:03,260
A Herzog documentary on a,

3884
01:33:03,290 --> 01:33:03,891
what's it called?

3885
01:33:03,891 --> 01:33:05,960
The cave of dreams or something like that.

3886
01:33:06,530 --> 01:33:07,120
Hold on,

3887
01:33:07,120 --> 01:33:11,060
let me find that for the folks who
are listening because it's a really

3888
01:33:11,061 --> 01:33:11,630
interesting,

3889
01:33:11,630 --> 01:33:16,630
they found some really old cave
paintings that predated what the,

3890
01:33:17,751 --> 01:33:19,280
like the most,

3891
01:33:19,370 --> 01:33:19,551
the,

3892
01:33:19,551 --> 01:33:22,340
the oldest before that by like
a pretty substantial amount.

3893
01:33:25,180 --> 01:33:26,370
Find a real quick

3894
01:33:26,520 --> 01:33:27,750
uh,

3895
01:33:29,280 --> 01:33:29,700
yeah.

3896
01:33:29,700 --> 01:33:31,560
Cave of forgotten dreams.

3897
01:33:31,920 --> 01:33:32,790
That's what it's called.

3898
01:33:32,820 --> 01:33:33,690
It's amazing.

3899
01:33:34,730 --> 01:33:35,640
It's in France.

3900
01:33:35,830 --> 01:33:36,570
Oh yeah.

3901
01:33:36,570 --> 01:33:36,810
Yeah.

3902
01:33:36,810 --> 01:33:38,970
It's the oldest recorded cave paintings,

3903
01:33:39,330 --> 01:33:40,410
human or neanderthal.

3904
01:33:41,070 --> 01:33:41,790
Uh,

3905
01:33:41,790 --> 01:33:42,391
it's human.

3906
01:33:42,391 --> 01:33:44,730
I don't believe there's
neanderthal cave paintings.

3907
01:33:45,120 --> 01:33:48,690
I think we know that they made tools
and if you heard of this crazy bitch,

3908
01:33:49,140 --> 01:33:49,411
this,

3909
01:33:49,411 --> 01:33:49,711
this,

3910
01:33:49,711 --> 01:33:51,890
there's a guy who wants to bring back.

3911
01:33:52,230 --> 01:33:52,381
Oh,

3912
01:33:52,381 --> 01:33:53,640
I just had just awesome.

3913
01:33:53,641 --> 01:33:54,500
I was thinking about that.

3914
01:33:54,501 --> 01:33:54,760
Yeah,

3915
01:33:54,760 --> 01:33:55,170
yeah,

3916
01:33:55,170 --> 01:33:55,561
totally.

3917
01:33:55,561 --> 01:33:55,981
I was like,

3918
01:33:55,981 --> 01:33:57,230
that seems like an opening.

3919
01:33:57,250 --> 01:33:59,160
A bag of worms versus your yeah,

3920
01:33:59,220 --> 01:33:59,770
right.

3921
01:33:59,770 --> 01:34:00,180
They're going to,

3922
01:34:00,180 --> 01:34:01,013
they're asking for,

3923
01:34:01,210 --> 01:34:02,380
it's some Harvard Guy,

3924
01:34:02,381 --> 01:34:03,030
right?

3925
01:34:03,030 --> 01:34:03,970
The inner tall baby.

3926
01:34:05,810 --> 01:34:06,270
It's a,

3927
01:34:06,270 --> 01:34:07,910
some guys asking a woman to,

3928
01:34:07,911 --> 01:34:08,300
um,

3929
01:34:08,300 --> 01:34:10,430
to carry or carry a
fucking neanderthal baby.

3930
01:34:10,750 --> 01:34:11,210
Um,

3931
01:34:11,210 --> 01:34:15,260
I have no idea why anyone has
letting this guy say this.

3932
01:34:15,910 --> 01:34:17,970
Well because nothing wrong with saying it.

3933
01:34:18,440 --> 01:34:19,400
Your problem with doing it,

3934
01:34:19,520 --> 01:34:21,080
it sounds fucking crazy.

3935
01:34:21,081 --> 01:34:21,860
But this guys,

3936
01:34:21,860 --> 01:34:24,650
his name is George Church
and he's from Harvard.

3937
01:34:24,651 --> 01:34:25,520
This is legit.

3938
01:34:25,580 --> 01:34:26,960
This is not like some,

3939
01:34:27,200 --> 01:34:28,033
you know.

3940
01:34:29,550 --> 01:34:29,950
Yeah.

3941
01:34:29,950 --> 01:34:30,880
Well the,

3942
01:34:30,920 --> 01:34:31,110
the,

3943
01:34:31,110 --> 01:34:33,050
the really scary thing
is that we don't need,

3944
01:34:33,080 --> 01:34:34,820
we don't know shit about neanderthals.

3945
01:34:35,200 --> 01:34:35,780
We have no,

3946
01:34:35,780 --> 01:34:35,970
they're,

3947
01:34:35,970 --> 01:34:39,560
they're built more like gorillas in the
RP people and their brains when they

3948
01:34:39,620 --> 01:34:40,490
built more like realism.

3949
01:34:40,491 --> 01:34:41,300
There are people,

3950
01:34:41,300 --> 01:34:42,380
five foot tall,

3951
01:34:42,500 --> 01:34:43,460
200 pounds,

3952
01:34:43,610 --> 01:34:44,870
really sick bones,

3953
01:34:45,110 --> 01:34:45,861
big head's,

3954
01:34:45,861 --> 01:34:47,090
bigger heads in human beings,

3955
01:34:47,091 --> 01:34:48,760
much larger brain zoo.

3956
01:34:48,780 --> 01:34:50,000
It's a really trippy thing.

3957
01:34:50,001 --> 01:34:53,900
The idea that this crazy fuck wants to
bring these things back and that the fact

3958
01:34:53,901 --> 01:34:55,760
that you could do it
inside of a woman's body,

3959
01:34:56,180 --> 01:34:57,140
it's pretty ridiculous.

3960
01:34:58,880 --> 01:34:59,840
Crazy asshole.

3961
01:34:59,930 --> 01:35:00,141
But,

3962
01:35:00,141 --> 01:35:00,530
um,

3963
01:35:00,530 --> 01:35:01,011
so no,

3964
01:35:01,011 --> 01:35:04,400
I don't believe that this a Werner Herzog
thing was that I'm pretty sure that it

3965
01:35:04,401 --> 01:35:04,881
was a,

3966
01:35:04,881 --> 01:35:05,714
um,

3967
01:35:05,870 --> 01:35:06,531
it's all,

3968
01:35:06,531 --> 01:35:07,130
uh,

3969
01:35:07,130 --> 01:35:09,680
it's all homosapiens at
the first one's a female.

3970
01:35:10,580 --> 01:35:12,350
The first baby.

3971
01:35:13,810 --> 01:35:14,090
Yeah.

3972
01:35:14,090 --> 01:35:14,481
Better.

3973
01:35:14,481 --> 01:35:14,810
Better.

3974
01:35:14,810 --> 01:35:15,501
Because if it's a man,

3975
01:35:15,501 --> 01:35:16,760
it's just going to start raping.

3976
01:35:17,130 --> 01:35:18,230
Just kind of go on a rape,

3977
01:35:18,440 --> 01:35:21,440
rape and cannibal rampage
when it gets to full grown,

3978
01:35:21,770 --> 01:35:22,011
you know,

3979
01:35:22,011 --> 01:35:22,401
who knows.

3980
01:35:22,401 --> 01:35:25,640
We don't know the behavior of a
neanderthals because it's been a lot of

3981
01:35:25,641 --> 01:35:27,680
speculation that neanderthals
preyed on the units.

3982
01:35:27,740 --> 01:35:29,390
They might take bids to the next level.

3983
01:35:29,780 --> 01:35:32,900
Well if I was praying on humans obviously
didn't pray enough cause they got

3984
01:35:32,901 --> 01:35:33,261
wiped out,

3985
01:35:33,261 --> 01:35:34,420
but he might have been wine.

3986
01:35:34,421 --> 01:35:35,254
We wiped him out.

3987
01:35:35,630 --> 01:35:35,841
You know,

3988
01:35:35,841 --> 01:35:37,010
we were just a little bit smarter.

3989
01:35:37,130 --> 01:35:37,451
There's,

3990
01:35:37,451 --> 01:35:39,650
there's a lot of speculation
as to what happened to them.

3991
01:35:39,930 --> 01:35:40,220
Um,

3992
01:35:40,220 --> 01:35:43,640
there's also debate as to whether or not
they interpret it with us or whether or

3993
01:35:43,641 --> 01:35:45,170
not we have a common ancestor.

3994
01:35:45,171 --> 01:35:49,280
Like where we are genetic material where
we definitely have a common ancestor.

3995
01:35:49,281 --> 01:35:49,550
No,

3996
01:35:49,550 --> 01:35:49,851
yeah,

3997
01:35:49,851 --> 01:35:53,420
we definitely have a common ancestor but
common enough that we have in the inner

3998
01:35:53,421 --> 01:35:54,380
tall genes in us,

3999
01:35:55,100 --> 01:35:55,341
you know,

4000
01:35:55,341 --> 01:35:57,020
cause they don't know
if it's from breeding.

4001
01:35:57,050 --> 01:35:57,380
This is like,

4002
01:35:57,380 --> 01:35:59,120
it's like kind of a iffy area.

4003
01:35:59,121 --> 01:36:02,000
They're trying to piece together now
whether or not it's from humans breeding

4004
01:36:02,001 --> 01:36:02,390
with it,

4005
01:36:02,390 --> 01:36:04,550
but interesting enough the pop,

4006
01:36:04,580 --> 01:36:09,580
the possibility of humans breeding with
it was only neanderthal males and human

4007
01:36:10,011 --> 01:36:10,770
females.

4008
01:36:10,770 --> 01:36:11,540
Why?

4009
01:36:11,540 --> 01:36:12,110
I don't know.

4010
01:36:12,110 --> 01:36:13,960
I think it's a scientific reason for the,

4011
01:36:13,961 --> 01:36:15,530
the the hybrid to be able to,

4012
01:36:15,860 --> 01:36:17,960
it's kind of weird because
it seems like you'd want it,

4013
01:36:17,961 --> 01:36:20,570
the neanderthal women to be able
to carry like the bigger baby.

4014
01:36:20,930 --> 01:36:21,251
Yeah.

4015
01:36:21,251 --> 01:36:23,400
I think because like I say,

4016
01:36:23,401 --> 01:36:25,020
being a woman and got torn apart by,

4017
01:36:25,220 --> 01:36:26,840
I think they're just saying it was rape.

4018
01:36:27,110 --> 01:36:28,040
I think that's what I was saying.

4019
01:36:28,220 --> 01:36:29,720
I think that was saying it was a,

4020
01:36:29,840 --> 01:36:30,111
you know,

4021
01:36:30,111 --> 01:36:30,944
a conquer thing.

4022
01:36:31,130 --> 01:36:34,290
Cause there's also speculation as
to whether or not neanderthals eight

4023
01:36:34,460 --> 01:36:35,293
homosapiens.

4024
01:36:36,350 --> 01:36:36,860
Hmm.

4025
01:36:36,860 --> 01:36:40,430
That's the weirdest thing that I would
have been aware of recently that I didn't

4026
01:36:40,431 --> 01:36:42,950
know about was how often native Americans,

4027
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:44,170
other,

4028
01:36:44,170 --> 01:36:45,003
yeah.

4029
01:36:45,140 --> 01:36:48,320
Eight each other in Papa New Guinea
or stone under that kind of thing.

4030
01:36:49,070 --> 01:36:49,903
Are they really,

4031
01:36:50,620 --> 01:36:52,670
they're still in the cannibalism sort of,

4032
01:36:53,480 --> 01:36:55,250
they're all sending to a
lot of other freaky shit.

4033
01:36:55,251 --> 01:36:58,690
Like they're into having the
young boys in just their semen.

4034
01:37:00,130 --> 01:37:01,760
The semen tribes have,

4035
01:37:01,780 --> 01:37:03,580
a lot of people in the
states are starting to that.

4036
01:37:04,790 --> 01:37:06,170
They're called that Catholic priests.

4037
01:37:07,670 --> 01:37:09,380
This is a very different though.

4038
01:37:09,380 --> 01:37:11,600
This is like ritualized and open.

4039
01:37:12,110 --> 01:37:13,760
Whereas the Catholic priests thing is,

4040
01:37:13,970 --> 01:37:14,710
is uh,

4041
01:37:14,710 --> 01:37:15,170
in the,

4042
01:37:15,170 --> 01:37:16,580
in the confessional booth.

4043
01:37:16,730 --> 01:37:17,121
Yeah.

4044
01:37:17,121 --> 01:37:18,500
It's a little more scratch yours,

4045
01:37:18,750 --> 01:37:19,790
a little more sketch.

4046
01:37:20,140 --> 01:37:20,691
So these,

4047
01:37:20,691 --> 01:37:21,170
um,

4048
01:37:21,170 --> 01:37:24,800
these paintings in the
Werner Herzog documentary,

4049
01:37:24,801 --> 01:37:27,950
amazing stuff and their cave bears,

4050
01:37:27,951 --> 01:37:28,551
lions,

4051
01:37:28,551 --> 01:37:29,151
horses,

4052
01:37:29,151 --> 01:37:29,810
Bison,

4053
01:37:29,810 --> 01:37:31,330
Mamis Rhinoceros is,

4054
01:37:31,610 --> 01:37:36,610
and there are other animals between
30 and 32,000 year old drawings.

4055
01:37:37,940 --> 01:37:38,930
It's really amazing,

4056
01:37:38,931 --> 01:37:39,764
man.

4057
01:37:40,250 --> 01:37:43,700
Just think we managed to wipe out all
these different animals in the last 30,000

4058
01:37:43,701 --> 01:37:44,150
years.

4059
01:37:44,150 --> 01:37:44,540
Well,

4060
01:37:44,540 --> 01:37:46,370
they don't believe that people had a,

4061
01:37:46,371 --> 01:37:48,680
a play and wiping out the woolly mammoth.

4062
01:37:48,681 --> 01:37:48,921
There's,

4063
01:37:48,921 --> 01:37:49,310
there's,

4064
01:37:49,310 --> 01:37:50,330
there's thoughts about it.

4065
01:37:50,331 --> 01:37:54,200
But one of the more interesting thoughts
about the mammoth because the mammoth

4066
01:37:54,201 --> 01:37:59,201
extinction coincides with what they are
pretty sure now was significant meteor.

4067
01:38:00,300 --> 01:38:04,920
Meteor impacts meteor showers
somewhere around 12 13,000 years ago.

4068
01:38:05,310 --> 01:38:06,470
When they do the strata,

4069
01:38:06,520 --> 01:38:08,100
when they take soil samples,

4070
01:38:08,310 --> 01:38:10,770
they've found this thing called a,

4071
01:38:10,780 --> 01:38:11,461
it's like a,

4072
01:38:11,461 --> 01:38:14,010
a volcanic glass and impact glass.

4073
01:38:14,020 --> 01:38:15,570
It's big fit.

4074
01:38:15,630 --> 01:38:20,630
It's like it's green looking glass that
has come from either nuclear tests or

4075
01:38:21,030 --> 01:38:22,140
meteor impacts.

4076
01:38:22,350 --> 01:38:25,890
So when they find it all over the world
like 12,000 years ago and that sort of

4077
01:38:25,891 --> 01:38:27,780
coincides with some mass extinctions.

4078
01:38:28,140 --> 01:38:31,240
A lot of the scientists are starting to
speculate that that might've been what

4079
01:38:31,241 --> 01:38:32,430
wiped out a lot of things,

4080
01:38:32,431 --> 01:38:36,810
including a lot of like
major civilizations that the
world just got bombarded by

4081
01:38:36,811 --> 01:38:38,100
meteors at one point in time,

4082
01:38:38,160 --> 01:38:39,780
but somewhere around 12,000 years ago.

4083
01:38:40,020 --> 01:38:40,500
Hmm.

4084
01:38:40,500 --> 01:38:40,681
Yeah,

4085
01:38:40,681 --> 01:38:41,041
it's pretty,

4086
01:38:41,041 --> 01:38:41,910
pretty crazy stuff.

4087
01:38:42,090 --> 01:38:46,950
They think that might've had a part in
the saber tooth tiger and a wooly mammoth

4088
01:38:47,310 --> 01:38:47,880
and that uh,

4089
01:38:47,880 --> 01:38:48,990
some animals just weren't,

4090
01:38:48,991 --> 01:38:49,380
be able to make.

4091
01:38:49,380 --> 01:38:50,940
That was another animal
that trying to bring back.

4092
01:38:51,120 --> 01:38:52,620
They're trying to bring
back a wooly mammoth.

4093
01:38:52,870 --> 01:38:54,600
The Russian scientists trying to do that.

4094
01:38:55,350 --> 01:38:56,430
They need bigger carpets.

4095
01:38:56,760 --> 01:38:57,110
What,

4096
01:38:57,110 --> 01:38:59,700
what the fuck is with people
wanting to bring things back?

4097
01:38:59,730 --> 01:39:01,530
Like you know enough already.

4098
01:39:01,680 --> 01:39:03,030
How about some of them make an alien,

4099
01:39:03,510 --> 01:39:03,901
you know,

4100
01:39:03,901 --> 01:39:05,580
why is everybody bringing old shit back?

4101
01:39:05,850 --> 01:39:06,240
You know,

4102
01:39:06,240 --> 01:39:07,140
they probably are doing that.

4103
01:39:07,141 --> 01:39:08,100
They're just not telling us.

4104
01:39:10,260 --> 01:39:13,440
Maybe now you're out there camp and you
ever see something freaky ever hear a

4105
01:39:13,450 --> 01:39:13,951
big foot,

4106
01:39:13,951 --> 01:39:14,880
ever see a Ufo?

4107
01:39:15,060 --> 01:39:15,780
No,

4108
01:39:15,780 --> 01:39:16,141
nothing.

4109
01:39:16,141 --> 01:39:17,250
I don't really do the weird stuff.

4110
01:39:19,080 --> 01:39:22,290
You don't really do the weird stuff
like not into all the like weird,

4111
01:39:22,291 --> 01:39:23,190
random stuff like that.

4112
01:39:23,400 --> 01:39:24,810
I'm a very practical kind of guy.

4113
01:39:25,440 --> 01:39:26,610
You very practical.

4114
01:39:26,640 --> 01:39:28,770
Crazy mountain climber dude.

4115
01:39:29,190 --> 01:39:29,371
Yeah.

4116
01:39:29,371 --> 01:39:30,204
Very rational.

4117
01:39:30,540 --> 01:39:31,140
Rational.

4118
01:39:31,140 --> 01:39:31,890
Well,

4119
01:39:31,890 --> 01:39:33,120
you know by,

4120
01:39:33,121 --> 01:39:33,660
um,

4121
01:39:33,660 --> 01:39:38,520
by Ufos being irrational and the same
just because you haven't seen something

4122
01:39:38,521 --> 01:39:39,390
that's irrational,

4123
01:39:39,960 --> 01:39:40,321
would you,

4124
01:39:40,321 --> 01:39:43,410
would you freak out if you're out there
camping and all of sudden if an alien

4125
01:39:43,411 --> 01:39:45,480
landed Ufo flew overhead,

4126
01:39:45,510 --> 01:39:46,410
probably wouldn't freak out.

4127
01:39:46,411 --> 01:39:46,700
No,

4128
01:39:46,700 --> 01:39:47,491
but I'd be like that.

4129
01:39:47,491 --> 01:39:48,540
It's bad ass.

4130
01:39:48,600 --> 01:39:53,040
Do you think you'd still keep climbing
or would you like changed the subject and

4131
01:39:53,041 --> 01:39:53,950
start trying to,

4132
01:39:54,280 --> 01:39:56,750
trying to take time out to
chat with the alien or not?

4133
01:39:57,590 --> 01:39:58,423
I mean,

4134
01:39:59,080 --> 01:40:00,270
that's a good question actually.

4135
01:40:00,600 --> 01:40:03,510
I mean for sure if I had some kind of
crazy experience like that where I was

4136
01:40:03,511 --> 01:40:03,840
like,

4137
01:40:03,840 --> 01:40:05,740
I am 100% certain in their life,

4138
01:40:05,741 --> 01:40:06,360
in other planets,

4139
01:40:06,360 --> 01:40:09,330
like I probably would change my field a
bit because all of a sudden I'd be like,

4140
01:40:09,331 --> 01:40:12,150
there's definitely something like
more important going on in the world.

4141
01:40:12,550 --> 01:40:14,100
The real problem with,

4142
01:40:14,101 --> 01:40:14,730
um,

4143
01:40:14,730 --> 01:40:15,360
the,

4144
01:40:15,360 --> 01:40:18,480
of course with the idea that there's
some life from another planet that's

4145
01:40:18,481 --> 01:40:19,051
visiting us,

4146
01:40:19,051 --> 01:40:20,310
it's like where the fuck's the evidence.

4147
01:40:20,340 --> 01:40:20,970
That's the real,

4148
01:40:20,970 --> 01:40:22,170
that's what I'm saying about rational.

4149
01:40:22,180 --> 01:40:23,100
That's however,

4150
01:40:23,890 --> 01:40:27,490
if they're much more sophisticated than
us to the point where they can travel

4151
01:40:27,491 --> 01:40:28,300
from other planets,

4152
01:40:28,300 --> 01:40:30,130
it seems like they could be undetectable.

4153
01:40:30,190 --> 01:40:31,630
That's the same kind of arguments for,

4154
01:40:31,660 --> 01:40:31,901
you know,

4155
01:40:31,901 --> 01:40:32,940
whether there's a god or not,

4156
01:40:32,950 --> 01:40:33,730
it's like whatever.

4157
01:40:33,730 --> 01:40:36,340
Not really because the,

4158
01:40:36,430 --> 01:40:41,050
the actual fact of human life and
the fact that we have technological

4159
01:40:41,051 --> 01:40:42,850
superiority over all the animals.

4160
01:40:43,840 --> 01:40:47,230
When you look at all the other planets
and you extrapolate the amount of time

4161
01:40:47,231 --> 01:40:48,400
that they could have existed,

4162
01:40:48,430 --> 01:40:49,930
it's highly possible.

4163
01:40:50,180 --> 01:40:50,361
Yeah.

4164
01:40:50,361 --> 01:40:50,541
No,

4165
01:40:50,541 --> 01:40:54,130
I think it's highly likely
that there is in the universe.

4166
01:40:54,520 --> 01:40:55,390
I mean actually I think,

4167
01:40:55,420 --> 01:40:56,040
I'm sure there's,

4168
01:40:56,040 --> 01:40:57,550
I don't think any of us in the universe,

4169
01:40:57,790 --> 01:40:57,970
yeah,

4170
01:40:57,970 --> 01:40:59,320
just don't think they're
like messing around here.

4171
01:40:59,650 --> 01:41:03,400
But I see that and I agree
with you to a certain extent,

4172
01:41:03,520 --> 01:41:08,410
but then I see the fact that there's
so many fucking planets and we are

4173
01:41:08,411 --> 01:41:10,450
constantly trying to
explore these planets.

4174
01:41:10,480 --> 01:41:11,920
We're sending things to Mars,

4175
01:41:11,921 --> 01:41:12,191
we're,

4176
01:41:12,191 --> 01:41:17,191
we're looking with satellites and when
with telescopes and trying to observe

4177
01:41:17,350 --> 01:41:18,131
over time really,

4178
01:41:18,131 --> 01:41:19,060
really far apart.

4179
01:41:20,050 --> 01:41:20,620
Right.

4180
01:41:20,620 --> 01:41:25,270
My point is if we're constantly exploring
the universe as far as we can with our

4181
01:41:25,600 --> 01:41:29,980
limited technological capability in
2013 maybe that's just an aspect of

4182
01:41:29,981 --> 01:41:31,090
intelligent life period.

4183
01:41:31,091 --> 01:41:33,430
That intelligent life constantly
explores its dimensions.

4184
01:41:34,230 --> 01:41:37,690
Like maybe other really intelligent
life explore spiritually area.

4185
01:41:37,691 --> 01:41:38,510
They go inward.

4186
01:41:38,510 --> 01:41:38,921
They just,

4187
01:41:38,921 --> 01:41:39,280
you know,

4188
01:41:39,280 --> 01:41:40,030
that's good point.

4189
01:41:40,030 --> 01:41:40,863
Or both.

4190
01:41:41,390 --> 01:41:42,100
You know?

4191
01:41:42,100 --> 01:41:45,430
I just feel like part of
intelligence is being curious.

4192
01:41:45,430 --> 01:41:47,500
Part of being curious is
wondering if you're alone.

4193
01:41:47,530 --> 01:41:50,170
Part of being curious and wondering
if you're alone is looking.

4194
01:41:50,950 --> 01:41:52,210
So if I was a smart,

4195
01:41:52,211 --> 01:41:52,900
curious,

4196
01:41:52,900 --> 01:41:54,460
intelligent thing from another planet,

4197
01:41:54,490 --> 01:41:56,740
I think I'd go check out the space.

4198
01:41:56,770 --> 01:41:57,360
The university.

4199
01:41:57,360 --> 01:41:58,660
Hopefully when the aliens come,

4200
01:41:58,670 --> 01:41:59,730
they'll meet you there.

4201
01:41:59,770 --> 01:42:00,461
They're going to come to you,

4202
01:42:00,461 --> 01:42:00,960
dude,

4203
01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:02,590
you're going to be out there
camping and they got to go.

4204
01:42:02,591 --> 01:42:04,720
How come you're not shitting your pants
while you're climbing up that thing?

4205
01:42:05,020 --> 01:42:05,920
What are you doing up here?

4206
01:42:06,410 --> 01:42:07,420
Sleeping on a ledge.

4207
01:42:07,720 --> 01:42:09,220
50,000 feet above the earth.

4208
01:42:09,430 --> 01:42:10,930
50,000 that's a big mountain.

4209
01:42:11,080 --> 01:42:12,400
What is the biggest one
you've ever climbed?

4210
01:42:12,470 --> 01:42:13,011
What is the,

4211
01:42:13,011 --> 01:42:13,990
the biggest face?

4212
01:42:14,080 --> 01:42:15,730
Biggest faces is like 300 feet.

4213
01:42:15,731 --> 01:42:16,060
Probate.

4214
01:42:16,060 --> 01:42:16,721
Zach appetite.

4215
01:42:16,721 --> 01:42:18,370
And then you send money in Yosemite?

4216
01:42:18,580 --> 01:42:18,791
Yeah,

4217
01:42:18,791 --> 01:42:19,300
I think so.

4218
01:42:19,300 --> 01:42:20,920
And what's the legality for that stuff?

4219
01:42:20,950 --> 01:42:21,880
Did they totally fine?

4220
01:42:22,030 --> 01:42:23,800
Nobody hassles you about
climbing these things?

4221
01:42:24,070 --> 01:42:24,671
National Park.

4222
01:42:24,671 --> 01:42:25,504
I mean it's just,

4223
01:42:25,690 --> 01:42:25,991
you know,

4224
01:42:25,991 --> 01:42:26,560
recreation,

4225
01:42:26,560 --> 01:42:27,011
youth group,

4226
01:42:27,011 --> 01:42:27,640
whatever.

4227
01:42:27,640 --> 01:42:28,473
You just go fine.

4228
01:42:29,300 --> 01:42:33,700
Does there ever been any talk of
regulating it or keeping people from solo

4229
01:42:33,701 --> 01:42:34,780
climbing or anything like that?

4230
01:42:34,820 --> 01:42:35,070
No.

4231
01:42:35,070 --> 01:42:35,490
No?

4232
01:42:35,490 --> 01:42:36,323
No.

4233
01:42:36,740 --> 01:42:36,971
I mean,

4234
01:42:36,971 --> 01:42:37,661
how would you regulate?

4235
01:42:37,661 --> 01:42:38,350
I mean,

4236
01:42:38,350 --> 01:42:38,590
you know,

4237
01:42:38,590 --> 01:42:41,320
then you might as well be
regulating like fat people hiking,

4238
01:42:41,380 --> 01:42:41,681
you know,

4239
01:42:41,681 --> 01:42:43,600
because they're more likely to
have a heart attack or whatever.

4240
01:42:43,810 --> 01:42:44,140
Well,

4241
01:42:44,140 --> 01:42:45,190
that's the good point though.

4242
01:42:45,191 --> 01:42:48,170
The good point is personal freedom.

4243
01:42:48,240 --> 01:42:50,710
They definitely should be someone
to talk them into it though.

4244
01:42:50,800 --> 01:42:52,060
I don't think we should
put a gun to their head.

4245
01:42:52,370 --> 01:42:53,203
Um,

4246
01:42:53,620 --> 01:42:55,060
the personal freedom aspect of it,

4247
01:42:55,090 --> 01:42:55,923
I mean,

4248
01:42:56,410 --> 01:42:59,920
I'm a big believer and a big supporter
of personal freedom and this is,

4249
01:43:00,190 --> 01:43:00,461
I mean,

4250
01:43:00,461 --> 01:43:05,080
it's one of the few that a very few
people are exercising but is a really

4251
01:43:05,440 --> 01:43:08,320
radically dangerous pursuit
for the average person.

4252
01:43:08,440 --> 01:43:08,951
For you.

4253
01:43:08,951 --> 01:43:09,581
Maybe not,

4254
01:43:09,581 --> 01:43:09,761
you know,

4255
01:43:09,761 --> 01:43:11,470
you shake your head because a,

4256
01:43:11,471 --> 01:43:12,251
you're competent.

4257
01:43:12,251 --> 01:43:12,431
B,

4258
01:43:12,431 --> 01:43:15,370
you're aware and see it's something you
love to do and you've been doing your

4259
01:43:15,371 --> 01:43:15,761
whole life.

4260
01:43:15,761 --> 01:43:17,350
You have a massive amount
of experience for him.

4261
01:43:17,530 --> 01:43:19,180
But for the average
person and try to do it,

4262
01:43:19,181 --> 01:43:21,910
it could be mean if everybody
had to free solo clamp,

4263
01:43:21,911 --> 01:43:23,460
just stop and think about it via that.

4264
01:43:23,710 --> 01:43:25,960
It'd be a fucking raining people.

4265
01:43:25,961 --> 01:43:28,690
But if everybody put like 17 years
at work and the learning how,

4266
01:43:28,710 --> 01:43:28,901
and then,

4267
01:43:28,901 --> 01:43:29,261
I mean,

4268
01:43:29,261 --> 01:43:29,471
you know,

4269
01:43:29,471 --> 01:43:30,460
I'd probably be like,

4270
01:43:30,820 --> 01:43:31,980
there'll be no TVs,

4271
01:43:31,981 --> 01:43:33,160
there would be no cell phones,

4272
01:43:33,161 --> 01:43:34,090
there'll be no cars.

4273
01:43:34,091 --> 01:43:35,110
If everybody did that,

4274
01:43:35,111 --> 01:43:38,110
no one would get anything done because
they'd be just consistently focusing on

4275
01:43:38,111 --> 01:43:40,110
not falling in climbing.

4276
01:43:40,550 --> 01:43:41,383
Um,

4277
01:43:41,560 --> 01:43:43,900
but it's an interesting
personal freedom issue.

4278
01:43:43,930 --> 01:43:44,540
It's like,

4279
01:43:44,540 --> 01:43:47,710
well there are certain things that were
restricted from doing in this country

4280
01:43:47,711 --> 01:43:52,040
and this world and we're restricted
from taking a amount of chances.

4281
01:43:52,310 --> 01:43:56,040
But that one is just still completely
out there in the wild though.

4282
01:43:56,330 --> 01:43:59,480
It's one that I think like going hiking
or any kind of outdoor recreation is

4283
01:43:59,481 --> 01:43:59,990
pretty,

4284
01:43:59,990 --> 01:44:03,240
pretty unrestricted in the U s I'm here
alleged just wander into the woods and

4285
01:44:03,300 --> 01:44:04,133
go have an adventure.

4286
01:44:04,370 --> 01:44:04,671
I know,

4287
01:44:04,671 --> 01:44:06,470
but I mean the nanny state
government that we have,

4288
01:44:06,471 --> 01:44:08,000
I'm surprised that someone doesn't like,

4289
01:44:08,001 --> 01:44:08,241
hey,

4290
01:44:08,241 --> 01:44:09,110
you can't climb.

4291
01:44:09,140 --> 01:44:09,470
Um,

4292
01:44:09,470 --> 01:44:09,681
no,

4293
01:44:09,681 --> 01:44:09,861
no,

4294
01:44:09,861 --> 01:44:10,970
get down from their son.

4295
01:44:11,060 --> 01:44:11,361
You know,

4296
01:44:11,361 --> 01:44:12,920
cause that's sort of the attitude.

4297
01:44:13,390 --> 01:44:14,223
Yeah,

4298
01:44:14,620 --> 01:44:14,920
I dunno.

4299
01:44:14,920 --> 01:44:15,753
I mean,

4300
01:44:17,230 --> 01:44:17,590
yeah.

4301
01:44:17,590 --> 01:44:19,570
No one ever gets in trouble
at all for climbing anything.

4302
01:44:19,571 --> 01:44:21,460
As long as it's not a public
building or something like that.

4303
01:44:22,320 --> 01:44:24,280
You don't think so unless
it's on private property,

4304
01:44:24,281 --> 01:44:25,870
in which case the
landowner gets to choose,

4305
01:44:26,080 --> 01:44:26,710
you know.

4306
01:44:26,710 --> 01:44:26,831
Oh,

4307
01:44:26,831 --> 01:44:27,370
wow.

4308
01:44:27,370 --> 01:44:29,920
So all public property,

4309
01:44:29,990 --> 01:44:33,220
like public lands and national parks,

4310
01:44:33,221 --> 01:44:35,340
do you have some kind of like
recreational management plan?

4311
01:44:35,341 --> 01:44:35,681
So I mean,

4312
01:44:35,681 --> 01:44:38,530
you're not allowed to like drill bolts
or like change the rock in different ways

4313
01:44:38,531 --> 01:44:41,410
because when you climb you often
and like put bolts for protection,

4314
01:44:41,680 --> 01:44:42,160
you know,

4315
01:44:42,160 --> 01:44:43,150
black bolts in there.

4316
01:44:43,350 --> 01:44:43,571
Yeah.

4317
01:44:43,571 --> 01:44:45,300
For if you're climbing up a blank face,

4318
01:44:45,301 --> 01:44:47,380
like say your brick wall hook a giant.

4319
01:44:47,381 --> 01:44:48,214
I Hook.

4320
01:44:48,380 --> 01:44:49,121
I mean it's small.

4321
01:44:49,121 --> 01:44:49,360
Yeah.

4322
01:44:49,360 --> 01:44:51,100
But it's small enough that
you can clip your care,

4323
01:44:51,101 --> 01:44:52,780
meaner into and then clip
your rope into the beaner.

4324
01:44:53,440 --> 01:44:54,700
But um,

4325
01:44:54,760 --> 01:44:55,271
so I mean,

4326
01:44:55,271 --> 01:44:56,950
most national parks
have some kind of plan,

4327
01:44:56,980 --> 01:44:57,340
you know,

4328
01:44:57,340 --> 01:44:58,030
limiting,

4329
01:44:58,030 --> 01:44:58,863
uh,

4330
01:44:58,890 --> 01:44:59,140
you know,

4331
01:44:59,140 --> 01:45:00,940
bolting and things like that are,

4332
01:45:00,941 --> 01:45:01,211
you know,

4333
01:45:01,211 --> 01:45:03,340
they have some kind of
like management use thing,

4334
01:45:03,670 --> 01:45:06,040
but for the most part you can
just go climb whatever you want.

4335
01:45:06,420 --> 01:45:08,040
Do you have any other crazy hobbies?

4336
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:09,211
Uh,

4337
01:45:09,211 --> 01:45:09,960
no.

4338
01:45:09,960 --> 01:45:10,501
This is it.

4339
01:45:10,501 --> 01:45:10,951
This is just,

4340
01:45:10,951 --> 01:45:13,620
this fulfills all of
your time because travel,

4341
01:45:13,640 --> 01:45:13,910
I mean,

4342
01:45:13,910 --> 01:45:16,200
I read and I travel and I do stuff.

4343
01:45:17,260 --> 01:45:18,093
Yeah,

4344
01:45:18,480 --> 01:45:19,530
it's a fascinating life,

4345
01:45:19,531 --> 01:45:19,771
man.

4346
01:45:19,771 --> 01:45:20,191
I mean,

4347
01:45:20,191 --> 01:45:21,360
I know it's yours and you're like,

4348
01:45:21,361 --> 01:45:21,700
yeah,

4349
01:45:21,700 --> 01:45:22,130
yeah,

4350
01:45:22,130 --> 01:45:22,330
yeah.

4351
01:45:22,330 --> 01:45:23,220
That's pretty normal.

4352
01:45:23,221 --> 01:45:23,550
You know,

4353
01:45:23,550 --> 01:45:25,260
it's not pretty normal.

4354
01:45:25,261 --> 01:45:26,340
It's pretty normal to you.

4355
01:45:26,370 --> 01:45:26,671
Well,

4356
01:45:26,671 --> 01:45:27,180
yeah,

4357
01:45:27,180 --> 01:45:27,680
but I'm,

4358
01:45:27,680 --> 01:45:29,130
but I mattered the most to me.

4359
01:45:29,160 --> 01:45:29,993
You know what I mean?

4360
01:45:30,120 --> 01:45:31,720
I would imagine to me it's super normal.

4361
01:45:31,730 --> 01:45:31,981
I'm like,

4362
01:45:31,981 --> 01:45:32,760
I think it's cool.

4363
01:45:32,760 --> 01:45:32,911
Well,

4364
01:45:32,911 --> 01:45:34,050
it is very cool.

4365
01:45:34,080 --> 01:45:34,920
It's very cool.

4366
01:45:34,921 --> 01:45:35,880
It's very interesting.

4367
01:45:35,940 --> 01:45:36,331
I mean your,

4368
01:45:36,331 --> 01:45:38,340
your approach to this whole
thing is a very unique,

4369
01:45:38,341 --> 01:45:40,440
you're a very unique
person and that's why,

4370
01:45:40,490 --> 01:45:40,920
um,

4371
01:45:40,920 --> 01:45:41,401
you,

4372
01:45:41,401 --> 01:45:42,180
uh,

4373
01:45:42,180 --> 01:45:44,490
are fascinating to
people and I think it's,

4374
01:45:44,550 --> 01:45:48,480
it's a very charming that you have
this math that you've said that like 10

4375
01:45:48,481 --> 01:45:48,960
times,

4376
01:45:48,960 --> 01:45:51,120
the more I talked to you
about how unique you are,

4377
01:45:51,121 --> 01:45:51,871
a compliment you like,

4378
01:45:51,871 --> 01:45:52,704
hey,

4379
01:45:53,730 --> 01:45:54,511
that's your take on things.

4380
01:45:54,511 --> 01:45:56,580
But that is also why
you're so good and you,

4381
01:45:56,581 --> 01:45:57,000
you,

4382
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:57,450
um,

4383
01:45:57,450 --> 01:46:00,060
that's why it's so compatible,

4384
01:46:00,220 --> 01:46:00,510
you know,

4385
01:46:00,510 --> 01:46:01,170
with you,

4386
01:46:01,170 --> 01:46:01,651
with you,

4387
01:46:01,651 --> 01:46:02,341
your personality,

4388
01:46:02,341 --> 01:46:03,030
like how you,

4389
01:46:03,030 --> 01:46:04,050
how you roll with things.

4390
01:46:04,500 --> 01:46:05,940
That's it probably.

4391
01:46:06,290 --> 01:46:06,840
Okay.

4392
01:46:06,840 --> 01:46:11,670
Must Somehow or another contribute to
your ability to be so good at this or your

4393
01:46:11,790 --> 01:46:14,490
passion and desire the
way it fits in your,

4394
01:46:14,491 --> 01:46:14,731
your,

4395
01:46:14,731 --> 01:46:16,740
your square hole for your square peg.

4396
01:46:16,741 --> 01:46:17,574
You know what I mean?

4397
01:46:18,100 --> 01:46:18,330
Yeah.

4398
01:46:18,330 --> 01:46:19,330
I mean I think I just,

4399
01:46:19,480 --> 01:46:20,560
I've always loved it and um,

4400
01:46:21,010 --> 01:46:21,410
and I,

4401
01:46:21,410 --> 01:46:25,150
I mean I'd put a lot of work into it and
I figure anybody that like loves what

4402
01:46:25,151 --> 01:46:26,130
they do and work hard at it,

4403
01:46:26,131 --> 01:46:27,340
it's probably going to
get pretty good at it.

4404
01:46:27,590 --> 01:46:28,790
Do you have any goals?

4405
01:46:28,800 --> 01:46:30,290
Are there certain mountains
that you have not?

4406
01:46:30,640 --> 01:46:30,791
Yeah,

4407
01:46:30,791 --> 01:46:31,241
for sure.

4408
01:46:31,241 --> 01:46:32,170
I got all kinds of,

4409
01:46:32,171 --> 01:46:33,430
I have a lot of like travel goals,

4410
01:46:33,431 --> 01:46:36,970
like places I want to go climbing
and then I have actual like climbing

4411
01:46:37,150 --> 01:46:38,050
achievement goals,

4412
01:46:38,051 --> 01:46:38,231
you know,

4413
01:46:38,231 --> 01:46:40,690
things that I want to climb or
new things to do or whatever.

4414
01:46:40,800 --> 01:46:41,061
What's,

4415
01:46:41,061 --> 01:46:41,651
what's a big one?

4416
01:46:41,651 --> 01:46:42,484
It's one,

4417
01:46:42,820 --> 01:46:43,091
I don't know.

4418
01:46:43,091 --> 01:46:44,200
They're all there on the DL,

4419
01:46:44,201 --> 01:46:44,800
you know.

4420
01:46:44,800 --> 01:46:46,330
Oh you can't tell people what I mean.

4421
01:46:46,390 --> 01:46:46,870
Okay.

4422
01:46:46,870 --> 01:46:47,740
You don't want to talk about it?

4423
01:46:48,100 --> 01:46:48,441
No.

4424
01:46:48,441 --> 01:46:48,631
Well,

4425
01:46:48,631 --> 01:46:51,850
so I don't really set like specific so
long goals because I don't really like

4426
01:46:51,851 --> 01:46:52,200
the price.

4427
01:46:52,200 --> 01:46:53,380
Cause normally when you set a goal,

4428
01:46:53,381 --> 01:46:55,270
you go through the whole process
of like you set the goal,

4429
01:46:55,271 --> 01:46:56,110
you train for it,

4430
01:46:56,140 --> 01:46:56,921
you achieve it,

4431
01:46:56,921 --> 01:46:57,371
whatever,

4432
01:46:57,371 --> 01:46:57,790
you know,

4433
01:46:57,790 --> 01:46:58,481
you make it happen.

4434
01:46:58,481 --> 01:47:00,460
But the thing was so long because
I don't really like that pressure.

4435
01:47:00,700 --> 01:47:02,190
I don't want to feel
like I have to go solo.

4436
01:47:02,200 --> 01:47:02,850
Something.

4437
01:47:02,850 --> 01:47:04,780
So generally has that climate goals,

4438
01:47:04,781 --> 01:47:06,820
like retirement to climb
with a rope or you know,

4439
01:47:07,210 --> 01:47:08,080
places I want to go.

4440
01:47:08,440 --> 01:47:10,870
But for so long it's more
like a soloing fantasy,

4441
01:47:10,871 --> 01:47:11,081
you know,

4442
01:47:11,081 --> 01:47:14,560
like something I'd love to do and I'll
sort of keep it in the back of my mind.

4443
01:47:14,561 --> 01:47:16,540
Like what kind of shape
I'd have to be in to do it.

4444
01:47:16,600 --> 01:47:17,350
Or like,

4445
01:47:17,350 --> 01:47:17,620
you know,

4446
01:47:17,620 --> 01:47:18,820
what time of year I'd have to be in,

4447
01:47:18,821 --> 01:47:19,654
what kind of shape,

4448
01:47:20,050 --> 01:47:20,883
but um,

4449
01:47:20,920 --> 01:47:22,870
but it's never like that's
my goal for this season.

4450
01:47:22,871 --> 01:47:24,070
It's more like if it happens,

4451
01:47:24,071 --> 01:47:24,760
it'd be sweet.

4452
01:47:24,760 --> 01:47:25,290
If not,

4453
01:47:25,290 --> 01:47:25,570
you know,

4454
01:47:25,570 --> 01:47:26,160
whatever.

4455
01:47:26,160 --> 01:47:31,160
Why has no one come up with a
television show that follows you?

4456
01:47:31,830 --> 01:47:34,470
Climbing up mountains and,

4457
01:47:34,600 --> 01:47:35,170
and,

4458
01:47:35,170 --> 01:47:36,010
and broadcast.

4459
01:47:36,011 --> 01:47:36,211
I mean,

4460
01:47:36,211 --> 01:47:37,140
people have talked about it,

4461
01:47:37,141 --> 01:47:38,550
but the thing is after that,

4462
01:47:38,640 --> 01:47:40,120
after anybody chats to me for a while,

4463
01:47:40,121 --> 01:47:40,411
they're like,

4464
01:47:40,411 --> 01:47:42,210
turns out that guy's
actually really boring.

4465
01:47:42,400 --> 01:47:43,530
You're boring at all men.

4466
01:47:43,850 --> 01:47:44,410
Yeah.

4467
01:47:44,410 --> 01:47:45,690
I don't think you're boring it all.

4468
01:47:45,691 --> 01:47:45,961
Thank you.

4469
01:47:45,961 --> 01:47:46,770
Fascinating.

4470
01:47:46,770 --> 01:47:46,951
No,

4471
01:47:46,951 --> 01:47:47,720
you're mellow.

4472
01:47:47,720 --> 01:47:49,520
You're confused when Ella was born.

4473
01:47:49,521 --> 01:47:49,630
You,

4474
01:47:49,630 --> 01:47:51,030
I'm very interesting.

4475
01:47:51,060 --> 01:47:51,893
There's nothing,

4476
01:47:52,140 --> 01:47:54,060
there's nothing boring about you.

4477
01:47:54,061 --> 01:47:56,070
You have a very distinct personality,

4478
01:47:56,071 --> 01:47:59,220
a very distinct way of looking at
this very odd life that you have.

4479
01:47:59,221 --> 01:48:00,990
It's very compatible for what you do.

4480
01:48:01,390 --> 01:48:02,223
It's not boring.

4481
01:48:02,470 --> 01:48:02,850
Um,

4482
01:48:02,850 --> 01:48:05,460
what you do is not even
remotely fucking boring.

4483
01:48:05,490 --> 01:48:06,990
It's hair raising.

4484
01:48:06,991 --> 01:48:08,370
It makes people shit their pants,

4485
01:48:08,371 --> 01:48:08,941
my hands,

4486
01:48:08,941 --> 01:48:09,361
sweat.

4487
01:48:09,361 --> 01:48:10,140
Watching your fitness,

4488
01:48:10,140 --> 01:48:10,741
what I was talking about,

4489
01:48:10,741 --> 01:48:10,950
you know,

4490
01:48:10,950 --> 01:48:12,390
super bowl versus training.

4491
01:48:12,420 --> 01:48:12,931
You know what I mean?

4492
01:48:12,931 --> 01:48:15,330
Like you're saying the
Superbowl stuff looks amazing.

4493
01:48:15,331 --> 01:48:15,571
You know,

4494
01:48:15,571 --> 01:48:16,660
like the big solos,

4495
01:48:16,670 --> 01:48:16,951
you're like,

4496
01:48:16,951 --> 01:48:17,521
that's red.

4497
01:48:17,521 --> 01:48:18,600
But what she did on 60 minutes,

4498
01:48:18,601 --> 01:48:19,680
you said wasn't even that big.

4499
01:48:20,160 --> 01:48:20,580
Well,

4500
01:48:20,580 --> 01:48:20,851
no,

4501
01:48:20,851 --> 01:48:21,240
I mean,

4502
01:48:21,240 --> 01:48:23,520
but still I only do that kind of
thing handful of times a year.

4503
01:48:23,970 --> 01:48:24,690
You know,

4504
01:48:24,690 --> 01:48:27,300
the majority of the year I'm just going
out climbing with my friends and just

4505
01:48:27,420 --> 01:48:28,350
normal climbing.

4506
01:48:28,460 --> 01:48:30,480
You know the same thing that
people are doing in the gym except

4507
01:48:31,390 --> 01:48:32,830
they have shows,

4508
01:48:33,040 --> 01:48:33,580
okay,

4509
01:48:33,580 --> 01:48:34,880
we're going to have

4510
01:48:36,400 --> 01:48:39,940
like I don't give a shout back on
shops and they come in and they go,

4511
01:48:39,941 --> 01:48:40,870
hey man,

4512
01:48:41,050 --> 01:48:41,630
how much,

4513
01:48:41,630 --> 01:48:43,300
well give me for this band.

4514
01:48:43,670 --> 01:48:44,070
No.

4515
01:48:44,070 --> 01:48:44,861
And the guy's like,

4516
01:48:44,861 --> 01:48:45,880
I'll give you a two on it,

4517
01:48:45,881 --> 01:48:46,181
man.

4518
01:48:46,181 --> 01:48:51,181
I need to 50 I can't go to 50 I'll give
you a two 25 that's the fucking show

4519
01:48:51,701 --> 01:48:52,091
they're selling.

4520
01:48:52,091 --> 01:48:52,560
Dammit.

4521
01:48:52,560 --> 01:48:55,120
That kind of shit makes the world worse
and I don't want to contribute to that.

4522
01:48:55,121 --> 01:48:56,960
You would not be contributing it to him,

4523
01:48:57,010 --> 01:48:57,371
my friend.

4524
01:48:57,371 --> 01:48:58,850
What I'm saying is that there's,

4525
01:48:59,230 --> 01:49:04,230
people are fascinated by shit that's not
even close to is interesting as you are

4526
01:49:04,601 --> 01:49:05,434
what you're doing.

4527
01:49:05,500 --> 01:49:07,600
I really think it would
be an amazing show.

4528
01:49:07,601 --> 01:49:09,010
I think you're dead wrong.

4529
01:49:09,011 --> 01:49:09,880
I don't think there's,

4530
01:49:09,940 --> 01:49:10,750
there's been talk

4531
01:49:10,750 --> 01:49:11,420
like I doubt it.

4532
01:49:11,420 --> 01:49:12,800
I doubt there would be a show,

4533
01:49:12,801 --> 01:49:13,634
but I think there probably will.

4534
01:49:13,850 --> 01:49:14,810
Why wouldn't it be a show?

4535
01:49:14,811 --> 01:49:16,400
So when he's a fucking step is honestly,

4536
01:49:16,401 --> 01:49:17,330
there's not much content,

4537
01:49:17,331 --> 01:49:17,541
you know,

4538
01:49:17,541 --> 01:49:18,950
like because,

4539
01:49:19,490 --> 01:49:22,250
well what if you do like 10 episodes
or something and you have to sell us

4540
01:49:22,251 --> 01:49:23,210
something big for each one.

4541
01:49:23,211 --> 01:49:27,740
Like I don't want to not watch real
housewives of Beverly Hills and I'm glad I

4542
01:49:27,741 --> 01:49:28,130
have it.

4543
01:49:28,130 --> 01:49:28,911
This is the idea.

4544
01:49:28,911 --> 01:49:29,511
This is my idea.

4545
01:49:29,511 --> 01:49:30,310
You ready for this?

4546
01:49:30,310 --> 01:49:31,790
We may get a desk squad production.

4547
01:49:31,791 --> 01:49:35,990
Then what we're gonna do is we're going
to bring you with Brian in between all

4548
01:49:35,991 --> 01:49:37,250
of your climbing,

4549
01:49:37,280 --> 01:49:41,120
you're going to hang out with Brian and
all of his porn star friends and our

4550
01:49:41,121 --> 01:49:41,480
friends.

4551
01:49:41,480 --> 01:49:41,921
Oh yeah,

4552
01:49:41,921 --> 01:49:42,161
yeah,

4553
01:49:42,161 --> 01:49:42,381
yeah.

4554
01:49:42,381 --> 01:49:43,580
He thinks porn stars.

4555
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:44,480
Oh yeah.

4556
01:49:44,480 --> 01:49:45,313
Kids at mass.

4557
01:49:45,370 --> 01:49:45,621
Oh,

4558
01:49:45,621 --> 01:49:48,120
I can hear you all the
best way they would like.

4559
01:49:48,130 --> 01:49:48,963
Yeah.

4560
01:49:49,410 --> 01:49:51,220
They would climb up and down them,

4561
01:49:54,250 --> 01:49:55,550
throw some shit on a ride.

4562
01:49:55,560 --> 01:49:57,370
Look peaked his interest.

4563
01:49:57,371 --> 01:49:57,641
He's like,

4564
01:49:57,641 --> 01:49:58,240
Whoa,

4565
01:49:58,240 --> 01:50:00,280
go kind of girls to be porn stars.

4566
01:50:00,281 --> 01:50:01,114
Do you want to meet them?

4567
01:50:01,470 --> 01:50:01,630
Well,

4568
01:50:01,630 --> 01:50:01,990
let's say it,

4569
01:50:01,990 --> 01:50:03,100
it came to Vegas last week.

4570
01:50:03,280 --> 01:50:04,270
We can make this happen.

4571
01:50:04,300 --> 01:50:05,680
That's an easy thing to make happen.

4572
01:50:05,950 --> 01:50:06,580
I'm not kidding.

4573
01:50:06,580 --> 01:50:06,940
Huh?

4574
01:50:06,940 --> 01:50:08,590
That's a really easy thing to make happen.

4575
01:50:08,620 --> 01:50:09,130
Yeah.

4576
01:50:09,130 --> 01:50:10,090
You want to go hang out with him?

4577
01:50:10,330 --> 01:50:12,820
How long had towns for
from this parking lot.

4578
01:50:12,821 --> 01:50:13,780
I was going to drive to Vegas,

4579
01:50:13,781 --> 01:50:16,000
but maybe you drive to hang
out with Brian in Burbank.

4580
01:50:16,001 --> 01:50:16,111
You know,

4581
01:50:16,111 --> 01:50:17,830
we'll go to off guard
with a bunch of skanks.

4582
01:50:19,300 --> 01:50:20,230
Bring seven of them.

4583
01:50:20,530 --> 01:50:22,060
And by skanks I say that lovingly.

4584
01:50:22,061 --> 01:50:24,430
Just cause he was the
funny thing to say ladies,

4585
01:50:24,520 --> 01:50:25,353
don't be hating.

4586
01:50:25,520 --> 01:50:27,160
Do what you gotta do a yeah,

4587
01:50:27,190 --> 01:50:32,190
he can introduce you that see that world
to you is like your eyebrows went up in

4588
01:50:33,821 --> 01:50:34,330
the air.

4589
01:50:34,330 --> 01:50:35,800
It changed the entire tone.

4590
01:50:35,920 --> 01:50:37,780
See that's how the show gets exciting.

4591
01:50:38,080 --> 01:50:43,080
We bring you with him in between
a solo climbs with porn stars.

4592
01:50:44,470 --> 01:50:45,140
Exactly.

4593
01:50:45,140 --> 01:50:46,180
We would spice it up.

4594
01:50:46,510 --> 01:50:47,020
Listen,

4595
01:50:47,020 --> 01:50:47,461
you're,

4596
01:50:47,461 --> 01:50:48,580
you're a mellow guy.

4597
01:50:48,610 --> 01:50:49,900
This would be a new,

4598
01:50:49,960 --> 01:50:52,300
unique curated experience.

4599
01:50:52,330 --> 01:50:53,131
Push my boundaries.

4600
01:50:53,131 --> 01:50:57,550
And so surely it's like going to Chile
or taking a fucking car and driving

4601
01:50:57,551 --> 01:50:59,560
across the desert for three days.

4602
01:51:00,130 --> 01:51:03,130
Basically we're going to chat
anywhere wherever you went.

4603
01:51:03,131 --> 01:51:08,131
You know what I'm saying is it's unique
in the cross and about four hours.

4604
01:51:08,710 --> 01:51:10,210
Could you really ain't
Chili's like this narrow.

4605
01:51:10,390 --> 01:51:10,511
Oh,

4606
01:51:10,511 --> 01:51:10,990
is it really?

4607
01:51:10,990 --> 01:51:11,600
I didn't know.

4608
01:51:11,600 --> 01:51:13,330
Damn geographically limited.

4609
01:51:13,390 --> 01:51:14,223
Have you,

4610
01:51:14,230 --> 01:51:15,430
have you ever climbed in Japan?

4611
01:51:15,760 --> 01:51:16,593
I have not,

4612
01:51:16,660 --> 01:51:18,520
but my family lived there
for a while actually.

4613
01:51:18,550 --> 01:51:19,050
I really,

4614
01:51:19,050 --> 01:51:19,510
yeah.

4615
01:51:19,510 --> 01:51:21,040
But your family lived in Japan?

4616
01:51:21,740 --> 01:51:22,750
I was conceived in Japan.

4617
01:51:22,751 --> 01:51:23,561
They were not in inches,

4618
01:51:23,561 --> 01:51:25,200
but I wish they were so much.

4619
01:51:26,800 --> 01:51:27,370
What did,

4620
01:51:27,370 --> 01:51:28,270
what did your parents do?

4621
01:51:28,550 --> 01:51:31,180
They were at the time they were teaching
English and then they both were like

4622
01:51:31,181 --> 01:51:33,730
college professors in
our teaching language.

4623
01:51:33,910 --> 01:51:34,690
Oh Wow.

4624
01:51:34,690 --> 01:51:35,650
My mom's a French teacher.

4625
01:51:35,920 --> 01:51:36,753
Wow.

4626
01:51:37,240 --> 01:51:39,340
So how many different countries
have you been to climate?

4627
01:51:39,880 --> 01:51:40,121
I don't know,

4628
01:51:40,121 --> 01:51:40,781
like 20.

4629
01:51:40,781 --> 01:51:41,614
30.

4630
01:51:42,080 --> 01:51:42,913
Um,

4631
01:51:43,240 --> 01:51:44,530
I dunno dude.

4632
01:51:44,531 --> 01:51:45,730
You live a fascinating life.

4633
01:51:45,800 --> 01:51:46,780
I think it's a,

4634
01:51:46,781 --> 01:51:47,141
it's,

4635
01:51:47,141 --> 01:51:47,561
it's,

4636
01:51:47,561 --> 01:51:48,221
you're a,

4637
01:51:48,221 --> 01:51:51,370
you're a really unique guy and I love
the fact that you don't think you are,

4638
01:51:51,520 --> 01:51:52,280
it's uh,

4639
01:51:52,280 --> 01:51:53,113
you know,

4640
01:51:55,240 --> 01:51:55,901
I understand.

4641
01:51:55,901 --> 01:51:57,610
That's why Brian hangs
out with these porn stars.

4642
01:51:57,620 --> 01:51:58,453
Yeah,

4643
01:51:59,110 --> 01:51:59,501
exactly.

4644
01:51:59,501 --> 01:52:00,700
That's a perfect example.

4645
01:52:00,701 --> 01:52:02,230
I can take you to the UFC next weekend.

4646

This Saturday night at Mandalay bay.

4657
01:52:19,240 --> 01:52:21,250
Frankie Edgar's fighting Joe say Aldo,

4658
01:52:21,251 --> 01:52:21,640
JSA,

4659
01:52:21,640 --> 01:52:22,001
all those,

4660
01:52:22,001 --> 01:52:22,870
this guy from Brazil,

4661
01:52:22,871 --> 01:52:25,510
he's one of the top pound for
pound fighters on the planet.

4662
01:52:25,660 --> 01:52:26,770
So it's Frankie Edgar.

4663
01:52:26,771 --> 01:52:28,150
Frankie Edgar was a lightweight champion.

4664
01:52:28,151 --> 01:52:30,550
He's dropping down to one 45 to
fight this kind of super fight.

4665
01:52:30,730 --> 01:52:33,130
It's going to be fucking craziness.

4666
01:52:33,280 --> 01:52:34,960
People are flying in from Brazil.

4667
01:52:34,961 --> 01:52:36,280
They're flying in from the east coast.

4668
01:52:36,281 --> 01:52:37,240
It's guys from New Jersey.

4669
01:52:37,410 --> 01:52:40,300
It's two amazing fighters
and that's just one fight.

4670
01:52:40,510 --> 01:52:41,560
Alistair Overeem,

4671
01:52:41,561 --> 01:52:43,930
who's one of the biggest guys
in the heavyweight division,

4672
01:52:43,931 --> 01:52:45,100
265 pounds,

4673
01:52:45,120 --> 01:52:46,640
looks like a fucking superhero

4674
01:52:46,700 --> 01:52:47,690
from a comic book.

4675
01:52:47,960 --> 01:52:48,741
And he's fighting this guy,

4676
01:52:48,741 --> 01:52:53,741
Antonio bigfoot Silva was to cut weight
to make $265 that both giants and,

4677
01:52:54,620 --> 01:52:57,440
and Allister is a former
k one grand Prix champion,

4678
01:52:57,500 --> 01:52:58,400
like kickboxing,

4679
01:52:58,401 --> 01:53:01,520
k one at Grand Prix is like the
craziest kickboxing event in the world.

4680
01:53:01,610 --> 01:53:03,080
So he's this destroyer,

4681
01:53:03,200 --> 01:53:06,050
this guy who just does stand up straight
over who can kick through a wall.

4682
01:53:06,080 --> 01:53:06,913
He's a monster.

4683
01:53:06,930 --> 01:53:07,763
He didn't look,

4684
01:53:07,890 --> 01:53:11,330
pull up a picture of Alistair
Overeem because if you haven't seen,

4685
01:53:11,480 --> 01:53:16,480
just seeing this guy alone
is such a freak specimen of,

4686
01:53:16,921 --> 01:53:17,870
of humanity.

4687
01:53:17,871 --> 01:53:19,040
Six foot five,

4688
01:53:19,070 --> 01:53:21,860
265 pounds and literally
it doesn't even look real.

4689
01:53:22,280 --> 01:53:25,460
And Antonio Big Foot Silva
is like a literal giant.

4690
01:53:25,461 --> 01:53:27,870
He actually is a giant and big as me.

4691
01:53:28,070 --> 01:53:28,311
Well,

4692
01:53:28,311 --> 01:53:29,000
he's,

4693
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:29,750
look at that.

4694
01:53:29,750 --> 01:53:30,583
That's over.

4695
01:53:31,220 --> 01:53:31,671
Yeah.

4696
01:53:31,671 --> 01:53:32,660
What the fuck?

4697
01:53:33,050 --> 01:53:34,100
And there's jet in the background.

4698
01:53:34,160 --> 01:53:34,940
That's me.

4699
01:53:34,940 --> 01:53:35,773
That's my gig.

4700
01:53:36,450 --> 01:53:37,250
That's me.

4701
01:53:37,250 --> 01:53:41,080
I'm the commentator for the ultimate
fighting to make more crazy during this.

4702
01:53:41,240 --> 01:53:41,421
Yeah,

4703
01:53:41,421 --> 01:53:41,961
I do.

4704
01:53:41,961 --> 01:53:42,500
Um,

4705
01:53:42,500 --> 01:53:45,080
when I don't do this
or do stand up comedy,

4706
01:53:45,110 --> 01:53:46,880
I'm a commentator for cage fighting.

4707
01:53:47,330 --> 01:53:48,140
Yeah.

4708
01:53:48,140 --> 01:53:49,220
So you're back there and be like,

4709
01:53:49,280 --> 01:53:50,870
this guy's fucking yoked.

4710
01:53:50,871 --> 01:53:52,410
He's smashed that guy's head.

4711
01:53:52,820 --> 01:53:54,860
I'm announcing his official way in.

4712
01:53:55,070 --> 01:53:55,500
I'm in that,

4713
01:53:55,500 --> 01:53:56,540
I'm introducing him,

4714
01:53:56,810 --> 01:53:59,990
former k one grand Prix champions
in Strikeforce heavyweight champion.

4715
01:54:00,650 --> 01:54:00,861
Well,

4716
01:54:00,861 --> 01:54:02,900
I don't say that I w
I call out the weight.

4717
01:54:02,990 --> 01:54:05,460
See every fighter has no,

4718
01:54:05,480 --> 01:54:05,991
no I do.

4719
01:54:05,991 --> 01:54:06,510
I,

4720
01:54:06,510 --> 01:54:06,801
I was like,

4721
01:54:06,801 --> 01:54:07,520
how hard is that?

4722
01:54:07,520 --> 01:54:08,353
You fucking loser.

4723
01:54:08,900 --> 01:54:09,733
65.

4724
01:54:10,910 --> 01:54:11,743
That's one day.

4725
01:54:11,980 --> 01:54:15,890
And then the next day I'm the commentator
when I do is I explain the nuances of,

4726
01:54:16,020 --> 01:54:16,340
you know,

4727
01:54:16,340 --> 01:54:18,320
what's in my uterus and I got a death.

4728
01:54:18,440 --> 01:54:18,801
No.

4729
01:54:18,801 --> 01:54:20,480
Like what he has to look out for,

4730
01:54:20,530 --> 01:54:20,810
what,

4731
01:54:20,810 --> 01:54:23,180
what's going to happen
if he doesn't do that,

4732
01:54:23,240 --> 01:54:24,590
what's going to happen?

4733
01:54:24,720 --> 01:54:25,011
You know,

4734
01:54:25,011 --> 01:54:25,990
that's me at the wins.

4735
01:54:29,230 --> 01:54:31,280
It's a handmade video.

4736
01:54:31,281 --> 01:54:33,920
People get silly cause they took that
one picture and they photoshopped it,

4737
01:54:34,070 --> 01:54:35,270
you know about Photoshop right

4738
01:54:36,950 --> 01:54:37,690
out there in the woods.

4739
01:54:37,690 --> 01:54:38,140
Yeah.

4740
01:54:38,140 --> 01:54:38,720
Um,

4741
01:54:38,720 --> 01:54:39,620
but so,

4742
01:54:39,880 --> 01:54:40,320
you know,

4743
01:54:40,320 --> 01:54:40,640
it's,

4744
01:54:40,640 --> 01:54:41,630
if you can make it,

4745
01:54:41,740 --> 01:54:42,500
it would be a trip.

4746
01:54:42,500 --> 01:54:43,720
It will freak you out to be,

4747
01:54:44,010 --> 01:54:44,300
you know,

4748
01:54:44,300 --> 01:54:48,140
15 16,000 people completely sold
out Mandalay Bay events center.

4749
01:54:48,170 --> 01:54:48,950
It's going to be nuts.

4750
01:54:48,950 --> 01:54:49,730
It's kind of bad ass.

4751
01:54:49,730 --> 01:54:51,380
It's a wild thing to see live.

4752
01:54:51,400 --> 01:54:51,950
It is.

4753
01:54:51,950 --> 01:54:52,310
Why?

4754
01:54:52,310 --> 01:54:56,630
Cause you're gonna see the best martial
artists on the face of the planet.

4755
01:54:56,631 --> 01:54:57,464
Without a doubt.

4756
01:54:57,470 --> 01:55:00,530
I mean there's a few other guys that won't
be competing this Saturday night that

4757
01:55:00,531 --> 01:55:01,370
are also the best,

4758
01:55:01,610 --> 01:55:06,610
but the examples of of excellence that
you're going to get there between Overeem

4759
01:55:07,131 --> 01:55:08,540
and Aldo and Edgar,

4760
01:55:08,570 --> 01:55:12,380
just those guys in big foot Silva and
there's a guy named Damien Maia from

4761
01:55:12,381 --> 01:55:16,790
Brazil was the baddest fucking Jujitsu
guy on the planet and MMA and he's

4762
01:55:16,791 --> 01:55:17,331
fighting this guy,

4763
01:55:17,331 --> 01:55:20,510
John Fitch was this bad ass
American wrestler and Oh,

4764
01:55:20,660 --> 01:55:22,210
it's gotta be from your site.

4765
01:55:22,340 --> 01:55:23,270
Oh my God.

4766
01:55:23,271 --> 01:55:24,240
Are you compensating for it?

4767
01:55:24,241 --> 01:55:24,690
Yeah.

4768
01:55:24,690 --> 01:55:25,370
That's my,

4769
01:55:25,370 --> 01:55:26,240
that's my other job.

4770
01:55:26,750 --> 01:55:27,171
My job.

4771
01:55:27,171 --> 01:55:28,070
I keep a bunch of jobs.

4772
01:55:28,071 --> 01:55:28,904
I'm like a Jamaican.

4773
01:55:29,360 --> 01:55:30,420
I try to keep your hustle,

4774
01:55:30,421 --> 01:55:31,254
our jobs,

4775
01:55:32,510 --> 01:55:34,820
but these are all things
that I'm drawn to.

4776
01:55:35,420 --> 01:55:36,380
Much like your,

4777
01:55:36,381 --> 01:55:37,790
your thing with the mountain climbing.

4778
01:55:37,850 --> 01:55:40,280
It probably seems unreal
t that's what I'm saying.

4779
01:55:40,281 --> 01:55:45,150
Like it would be another paradigm shifting
moment that the UFC did to see how

4780
01:55:45,151 --> 01:55:46,050
fucking crazy it can be.

4781
01:55:46,051 --> 01:55:49,740
If you can stay please did actually get
in cause I mean cause I can just do that

4782
01:55:50,060 --> 01:55:53,790
in front row and we'll get
you front row experience.

4783
01:55:53,800 --> 01:55:55,650
I want to make sure that you are,

4784
01:55:55,651 --> 01:55:57,420
I will have you sit behind me.

4785
01:55:57,540 --> 01:56:00,660
I will give you a seat
right behind me for the UFC.

4786
01:56:00,661 --> 01:56:01,800
You will be right there.

4787
01:56:01,801 --> 01:56:02,550
The cage.

4788
01:56:02,550 --> 01:56:05,190
You could step forward and touch it
with your hand if you want him to.

4789
01:56:05,190 --> 01:56:05,700
Shit.

4790
01:56:05,700 --> 01:56:08,780
Yeah it'd be the nuttiest fucking
thing I've ever seen in your life.

4791
01:56:08,781 --> 01:56:09,614
I don't like.

4792
01:56:09,710 --> 01:56:09,971
Yeah,

4793
01:56:09,971 --> 01:56:10,600
they're going to get there.

4794
01:56:10,600 --> 01:56:11,640
People listen,

4795
01:56:11,840 --> 01:56:12,390
this is,

4796
01:56:12,390 --> 01:56:13,980
this is this their job,

4797
01:56:14,420 --> 01:56:17,550
their job is to try to hurt the other
guy and the other guy tries to hurt them.

4798
01:56:17,551 --> 01:56:18,960
But it's very scientific.

4799
01:56:18,961 --> 01:56:20,010
It's very technical,

4800
01:56:20,580 --> 01:56:21,600
very good experience.

4801
01:56:21,601 --> 01:56:22,830
So it's a great experiment.

4802
01:56:23,190 --> 01:56:25,950
What it is is is human
competition and it's,

4803
01:56:26,080 --> 01:56:26,580
you know,

4804
01:56:26,580 --> 01:56:28,930
one on one competition and
it's most difficult for him.

4805
01:56:28,960 --> 01:56:29,171
You're,

4806
01:56:29,171 --> 01:56:33,450
you're using your body to try to submit
and stop another person who's also using

4807
01:56:33,451 --> 01:56:34,680
their body and that's all you have.

4808
01:56:34,890 --> 01:56:37,950
You have pads over your knuckles and
your wits and your techniques and your

4809
01:56:37,951 --> 01:56:41,790
conditioning and your training and gut
and your ability to overcome the pressure

4810
01:56:41,791 --> 01:56:43,500
of the moment and all those things.

4811
01:56:43,530 --> 01:56:45,840
It's going to be fucking crazy.

4812
01:56:45,930 --> 01:56:46,110
Dude.

4813
01:56:46,110 --> 01:56:46,750
I remember my arm.

4814
01:56:46,750 --> 01:56:47,221
I just,

4815
01:56:47,221 --> 01:56:48,570
you should go.

4816
01:56:48,870 --> 01:56:50,280
I'm just going to Mexico to go climb.

4817
01:56:50,490 --> 01:56:50,911
You Go.

4818
01:56:50,911 --> 01:56:52,800
We'll fly in and Brian and he'll fly in.

4819
01:56:52,801 --> 01:56:55,040
A couple of gals with loose morals and a,

4820
01:56:55,090 --> 01:56:56,220
you'll have yourself a party.

4821
01:56:56,520 --> 01:56:57,810
Do you have anything
going on this weekend,

4822
01:56:57,811 --> 01:56:58,260
Bri?

4823
01:56:58,260 --> 01:56:59,070
You want to go?

4824
01:56:59,070 --> 01:56:59,903
Sure.

4825
01:57:01,140 --> 01:57:05,070
We just made a party and just
brought in Brian and you'll sit.

4826
01:57:05,100 --> 01:57:06,170
How about you sit next to him at the,

4827
01:57:06,180 --> 01:57:09,060
you have saved a bunch of ports or help
give you booze and they'll tell you

4828
01:57:09,120 --> 01:57:10,380
where to get the good ecstasy.

4829
01:57:11,340 --> 01:57:12,173
We might,

4830
01:57:12,480 --> 01:57:14,010
we might ruin your climbing career,

4831
01:57:14,011 --> 01:57:14,701
but trust me,

4832
01:57:14,701 --> 01:57:16,140
you're going to have a memorable weekend.

4833
01:57:16,550 --> 01:57:18,480
If you can get me a sec scan,

4834
01:57:18,520 --> 01:57:19,470
I'll be super site.

4835
01:57:19,560 --> 01:57:21,060
He can definitely get you a sex scandal.

4836
01:57:21,061 --> 01:57:22,480
I have to do is fuck
him and we'll find out.

4837
01:57:22,910 --> 01:57:24,900
That would be a [inaudible]
camera's in here.

4838
01:57:24,900 --> 01:57:25,890
We could just do right here.

4839
01:57:25,950 --> 01:57:26,800
We can do it right here.

4840
01:57:26,850 --> 01:57:29,990
Just clear off these salt
lamps and put the deer antlers.

4841
01:57:30,280 --> 01:57:31,200
Climb the lox store.

4842
01:57:31,440 --> 01:57:31,830
Yeah,

4843
01:57:31,830 --> 01:57:32,480
we could go up to,

4844
01:57:32,480 --> 01:57:32,671
yeah,

4845
01:57:32,671 --> 01:57:33,451
you could climb the parents.

4846
01:57:33,451 --> 01:57:34,201
Really low angle.

4847
01:57:34,201 --> 01:57:35,490
That's seems kind of fruity.

4848
01:57:35,700 --> 01:57:36,450
Pretty easy.

4849
01:57:36,450 --> 01:57:36,730
Yeah.

4850
01:57:36,730 --> 01:57:37,500
Yeah.

4851
01:57:37,500 --> 01:57:38,300
That's hilarious.

4852
01:57:38,300 --> 01:57:40,370
Did on fear factor where
they claimed the Luxor was,

4853
01:57:40,440 --> 01:57:41,590
they actually slid down?

4854
01:57:42,770 --> 01:57:43,603
It

4855
01:57:45,940 --> 01:57:46,680
probably was.

4856
01:57:46,680 --> 01:57:49,200
There was quite a few things they did
on fear factor that we're dangerous.

4857
01:57:49,240 --> 01:57:50,970
Did you have a call in
deciding what they did?

4858
01:57:51,060 --> 01:57:51,271
No,

4859
01:57:51,271 --> 01:57:52,104
I did not.

4860
01:57:52,290 --> 01:57:53,123
There was,

4861
01:57:53,310 --> 01:57:55,020
there was two times where
I would have said no.

4862
01:57:55,080 --> 01:57:56,860
One time where they had a ride bowls.

4863
01:57:57,440 --> 01:57:58,890
I definitely was not into this.

4864
01:57:58,920 --> 01:58:00,630
It was because they thought
they could actually get killed.

4865
01:58:00,900 --> 01:58:01,411
Yes,

4866
01:58:01,411 --> 01:58:02,040
they could have.

4867
01:58:02,040 --> 01:58:04,770
We had two different stunt coordinators.

4868
01:58:04,860 --> 01:58:07,650
There's this one guy from
the beginning who was like,

4869
01:58:07,651 --> 01:58:09,120
you know they're Badass dudes.

4870
01:58:09,130 --> 01:58:11,040
You know how you're
looking at like climbing,

4871
01:58:11,740 --> 01:58:12,870
not fine,

4872
01:58:13,290 --> 01:58:15,090
so his sky bet stop man.

4873
01:58:15,091 --> 01:58:16,110
His whole lives name's Perry.

4874
01:58:16,111 --> 01:58:16,860
Great Guy.

4875
01:58:16,860 --> 01:58:18,120
And his attitude was like,

4876
01:58:18,121 --> 01:58:18,390
yeah,

4877
01:58:18,390 --> 01:58:19,080
I would do it.

4878
01:58:19,080 --> 01:58:19,900
I'll fucking do it.

4879
01:58:19,900 --> 01:58:20,160
You know?

4880
01:58:20,160 --> 01:58:20,580
I was like,

4881
01:58:20,580 --> 01:58:22,710
if his idea was that
they want to be on TV,

4882
01:58:22,711 --> 01:58:23,544
they should do it too.

4883
01:58:23,730 --> 01:58:27,240
But I'm cool with a lot of
that until it gets to animals.

4884
01:58:27,570 --> 01:58:32,190
Animals are very unpredictable and this
thing was they were going to ride these,

4885
01:58:32,370 --> 01:58:34,650
I mean these bulls were fucking enormous.

4886
01:58:34,651 --> 01:58:38,280
I don't know if you've ever been like
right next to a riding bull before,

4887
01:58:38,281 --> 01:58:40,800
but I was standing on the like sort of,

4888
01:58:40,801 --> 01:58:44,920
there's like a platform next to where the
cages and I'm looking down at the ball

4889
01:58:44,921 --> 01:58:45,311
and I'm like,

4890
01:58:45,311 --> 01:58:47,290
no fucking way.

4891
01:58:47,500 --> 01:58:49,240
There's no way I would get on that thing.

4892
01:58:49,410 --> 01:58:52,870
There are thousands of pounds and they're
just fucking in there and you see as

4893
01:58:52,871 --> 01:58:55,240
muscles and I go onto
that to ride the ball.

4894
01:58:55,300 --> 01:58:59,110
They don't get to ride the bull very
long because the bull fucking sends him

4895
01:58:59,111 --> 01:59:00,940
into orbit within like three seconds.

4896
01:59:01,790 --> 01:59:05,560
Good Rodeo guy tries to
get to eight seconds.

4897
01:59:06,100 --> 01:59:06,940
It's not like,

4898
01:59:07,120 --> 01:59:08,890
you know there's a guy who
could just do it all day long.

4899
01:59:08,891 --> 01:59:11,740
Like you can climb all day
long and no one can do that.

4900
01:59:12,160 --> 01:59:15,130
No one who's ever lived who rides
a bull until the bowls tired.

4901
01:59:15,160 --> 01:59:15,993
It doesn't happen.

4902
01:59:16,030 --> 01:59:17,020
You go flying.

4903
01:59:17,140 --> 01:59:20,500
So it's a matter of how long
does it take before you fail.

4904
01:59:20,560 --> 01:59:21,371
That's all it is.

4905
01:59:21,371 --> 01:59:24,130
It's like try to succeed
for as long as possible,

4906
01:59:24,160 --> 01:59:25,000
but you can't win.

4907
01:59:25,030 --> 01:59:27,480
And then does the work keeps
the bowl from crushing here?

4908
01:59:27,970 --> 01:59:29,020
That's a good question.

4909
01:59:29,021 --> 01:59:30,250
They have rodeo clowns.

4910
01:59:30,251 --> 01:59:32,470
They have a bunch of different
people that distractible.

4911
01:59:32,860 --> 01:59:34,180
But my beef was,

4912
01:59:34,181 --> 01:59:34,811
the guy was like,

4913
01:59:34,811 --> 01:59:36,400
well these here are training clowns are,

4914
01:59:36,401 --> 01:59:36,761
these are,

4915
01:59:36,761 --> 01:59:37,840
these are training bowls.

4916
01:59:38,890 --> 01:59:39,161
I go,

4917
01:59:39,161 --> 01:59:39,640
what do you,

4918
01:59:39,640 --> 01:59:40,061
does that mean?

4919
01:59:40,061 --> 01:59:40,271
He goes,

4920
01:59:40,271 --> 01:59:40,361
well,

4921
01:59:40,361 --> 01:59:42,580
they're not as aggressive
and like does that bold?

4922
01:59:42,581 --> 01:59:42,761
No,

4923
01:59:42,761 --> 01:59:43,930
he's a fucking training ball.

4924
01:59:44,020 --> 01:59:44,831
He doesn't know he's your training,

4925
01:59:44,831 --> 01:59:45,790
but what's a bull?

4926
01:59:45,850 --> 01:59:49,930
So you're basing it on how he's
thrown people off him in the past,

4927
01:59:50,170 --> 01:59:51,550
how he's going to throw these people off.

4928
01:59:51,551 --> 01:59:51,821
It's just,

4929
01:59:51,821 --> 01:59:55,360
just some sort of a random calculation
they making their cowboy mind.

4930
01:59:55,780 --> 01:59:59,800
And so we put these people on it and
they got launched and we launched,

4931
01:59:59,801 --> 02:00:00,660
it was really scary.

4932
02:00:00,710 --> 02:00:01,543
One girl,

4933
02:00:01,570 --> 02:00:04,840
it was really scary cause she only
weighed like 90 something pounds and she

4934
02:00:04,841 --> 02:00:05,440
just,

4935
02:00:05,440 --> 02:00:06,580
I mean it would the bold,

4936
02:00:06,640 --> 02:00:11,320
like for one second she was on this
boat and then she was literally flying

4937
02:00:11,321 --> 02:00:16,210
through the air and the bulls kicking
and the bull's foot just went right past

4938
02:00:16,211 --> 02:00:17,020
her face.

4939
02:00:17,020 --> 02:00:17,381
And I was like,

4940
02:00:17,381 --> 02:00:17,591
okay,

4941
02:00:17,591 --> 02:00:18,940
if that bolt kicked her face,

4942
02:00:18,941 --> 02:00:20,710
it would crush every bone in her face.

4943
02:00:20,740 --> 02:00:21,820
Even though she has a helmet on,

4944
02:00:21,990 --> 02:00:24,100
it would still probably
be crushed her helmet.

4945
02:00:24,790 --> 02:00:25,900
This is ridiculous.

4946
02:00:26,020 --> 02:00:27,700
And I think on that,

4947
02:00:27,701 --> 02:00:28,361
who approved that?

4948
02:00:28,361 --> 02:00:28,720
Shin,

4949
02:00:28,720 --> 02:00:29,620
NBC,

4950
02:00:30,680 --> 02:00:32,260
everybody that produced the show.

4951
02:00:32,530 --> 02:00:35,380
I think on that occasion they
essentially rolled the dice.

4952
02:00:35,410 --> 02:00:36,221
No one got hurt,

4953
02:00:36,221 --> 02:00:37,090
everyone was fine.

4954
02:00:37,210 --> 02:00:38,470
But I think it was a lot of luck.

4955
02:00:38,680 --> 02:00:42,340
And then the other times the
donkey comes a time where I said,

4956
02:00:42,341 --> 02:00:42,701
this is,

4957
02:00:42,701 --> 02:00:43,450
this is crazy,

4958
02:00:43,450 --> 02:00:44,290
you shouldn't do this.

4959
02:00:44,410 --> 02:00:44,681
I said,

4960
02:00:44,681 --> 02:00:46,150
the people don't want to eat.

4961
02:00:46,151 --> 02:00:46,481
Come.

4962
02:00:46,481 --> 02:00:46,751
Okay,

4963
02:00:46,751 --> 02:00:51,250
you can't just serve people come and
like you cook crossing some sort of hey

4964
02:00:51,590 --> 02:00:52,810
putting out propaganda.

4965
02:00:55,470 --> 02:00:56,303
That's funny you say that.

4966
02:00:56,380 --> 02:00:59,070
Like when you were talking about earlier
with the reality TV climbing stuff,

4967
02:00:59,071 --> 02:00:59,761
you won't follow me.

4968
02:00:59,761 --> 02:01:03,690
So as I actually saw like a pitch for
a climbing reality TV thing where they

4969
02:01:03,691 --> 02:01:04,910
were going through your downside.

4970
02:01:05,100 --> 02:01:05,933
Put that down.

4971
02:01:06,070 --> 02:01:07,270
What do you want me this photo,

4972
02:01:07,520 --> 02:01:10,340
he went to some AVN awards
because I brought you a present.

4973
02:01:10,341 --> 02:01:11,240
I'm like well thanks man.

4974
02:01:11,440 --> 02:01:11,960
He it,

4975
02:01:11,960 --> 02:01:15,050
it's just photo of guys with
giant Cox and their tight jeans.

4976
02:01:17,150 --> 02:01:17,600
Anyway,

4977
02:01:17,600 --> 02:01:18,470
so I saw this,

4978
02:01:18,471 --> 02:01:21,500
I was on the wall stop pitch for this
climbing show where they were like we're

4979
02:01:21,501 --> 02:01:22,100
going to,

4980
02:01:22,100 --> 02:01:26,600
it was supposed to be survivor meets a
meets ultimate fighter or something like

4981
02:01:26,601 --> 02:01:30,150
that but in climbing sense and so like
it was going to take non climbers and

4982
02:01:30,160 --> 02:01:32,840
then professional climbers and then we
teach them to solo and then we'd sold a

4983
02:01:32,841 --> 02:01:36,440
big walls and it was this whole production
and I was like how are you ever going

4984
02:01:36,441 --> 02:01:39,290
to have a show where you take non
climbers and you solo walls with them know

4985
02:01:39,291 --> 02:01:40,980
it's like you can't like,

4986
02:01:41,860 --> 02:01:42,470
you know,

4987
02:01:42,470 --> 02:01:44,720
you're like dude that's retarded.

4988
02:01:44,810 --> 02:01:45,441
It is retired.

4989
02:01:45,441 --> 02:01:47,060
And because also I actually,

4990
02:01:47,061 --> 02:01:50,270
I wrote back this scathing thing because
they asked me for a casting call type

4991
02:01:50,271 --> 02:01:51,100
deal.

4992
02:01:51,100 --> 02:01:54,630
I mean take your email forwarded to me
and I'll put it online and I did that.

4993
02:01:54,680 --> 02:01:55,161
We do that.

4994
02:01:55,161 --> 02:01:55,930
I can't vote for it.

4995
02:01:55,930 --> 02:01:56,680
Yeah.

4996
02:01:56,680 --> 02:01:57,950
Cause I was like people
would want to see it.

4997
02:01:58,130 --> 02:01:59,030
I was like what the heck?

4998
02:01:59,031 --> 02:01:59,511
You know I was like,

4999
02:01:59,511 --> 02:02:02,240
you might as well just have gladiators
like butcher and each other on TV.

5000
02:02:02,241 --> 02:02:03,950
Cause you're basically just
going to be watching carnage,

5001
02:02:03,951 --> 02:02:04,161
you know,

5002
02:02:04,161 --> 02:02:04,490
like,

5003
02:02:04,490 --> 02:02:09,490
I mean cause people will actually
die kind of messed up and you know,

5004
02:02:10,370 --> 02:02:10,611
I was like,

5005
02:02:10,611 --> 02:02:10,911
well that's it.

5006
02:02:10,911 --> 02:02:12,560
Nobody wants to see someone actually die.

5007
02:02:12,561 --> 02:02:13,550
You know it's so funny

5008
02:02:13,710 --> 02:02:17,070
you say that but yet this
is what you do every day.

5009
02:02:17,100 --> 02:02:17,461
You're like,

5010
02:02:17,461 --> 02:02:18,810
people will actually die.

5011
02:02:18,811 --> 02:02:19,890
But you do that

5012
02:02:21,010 --> 02:02:22,380
17 years right before it,

5013
02:02:22,381 --> 02:02:22,591
you know,

5014
02:02:22,591 --> 02:02:25,290
how much time would they need to be
conditioned before they could do anything?

5015
02:02:25,291 --> 02:02:25,630
What do you,

5016
02:02:25,630 --> 02:02:26,640
it depends on as he was.

5017
02:02:26,641 --> 02:02:28,140
I mean if it was something ultra easy,

5018
02:02:28,141 --> 02:02:30,990
I would just take any relatively fit
person and take them out with a lot of

5019
02:02:30,991 --> 02:02:32,160
supervision and you know,

5020
02:02:32,161 --> 02:02:34,020
if it's like a really easy solo.

5021
02:02:34,170 --> 02:02:37,320
Did you have a bunch of dudes at the
bottom holding a sheet by each corner?

5022
02:02:37,350 --> 02:02:38,183
Exactly.

5023
02:02:38,800 --> 02:02:40,980
Like you know like my ex girlfriend,

5024
02:02:40,981 --> 02:02:43,020
I mean I took her up a handful of really,

5025
02:02:43,021 --> 02:02:43,711
really easy,

5026
02:02:43,711 --> 02:02:45,240
this is kind of like extreme hiking,

5027
02:02:45,241 --> 02:02:45,930
you know,

5028
02:02:45,930 --> 02:02:46,440
but like,

5029
02:02:46,440 --> 02:02:46,621
you know,

5030
02:02:46,621 --> 02:02:47,900
I'd be scrolling right next to her.

5031
02:02:47,910 --> 02:02:50,850
She's taking her time and you're kind of
like talking her through it and you're

5032
02:02:50,851 --> 02:02:51,001
like,

5033
02:02:51,001 --> 02:02:51,121
oh,

5034
02:02:51,121 --> 02:02:51,541
you're good,

5035
02:02:51,541 --> 02:02:52,280
you're good.

5036
02:02:52,280 --> 02:02:52,570
You know.

5037
02:02:52,570 --> 02:02:55,980
So I mean like really fit like the person
at the top and give it some of that,

5038
02:02:56,130 --> 02:02:56,281
hey,

5039
02:02:56,281 --> 02:02:56,521
you know,

5040
02:02:56,521 --> 02:02:57,354
something like that.

5041
02:02:57,420 --> 02:03:00,960
That's how we're all freaked
out full of adrenaline.

5042
02:03:01,210 --> 02:03:01,510
I love,

5043
02:03:01,510 --> 02:03:02,790
but that's a wild ride.

5044
02:03:04,160 --> 02:03:07,380
Choose her or the mountain like did
you have to get in that situation?

5045
02:03:08,840 --> 02:03:09,673
Oh,

5046
02:03:09,780 --> 02:03:10,740
that kind of shit.

5047
02:03:11,650 --> 02:03:12,380
That's important.

5048
02:03:12,380 --> 02:03:13,213
That's actually,

5049
02:03:13,570 --> 02:03:14,011
let me see.

5050
02:03:14,011 --> 02:03:15,270
That was actually kind of those,

5051
02:03:15,271 --> 02:03:15,481
yeah,

5052
02:03:15,481 --> 02:03:16,314
that's about it.

5053
02:03:16,350 --> 02:03:18,750
Did that happen before it
was ever a girl was like,

5054
02:03:18,751 --> 02:03:19,670
I can't do this or what's,

5055
02:03:19,671 --> 02:03:20,880
she wasn't like me or the mountain,

5056
02:03:20,881 --> 02:03:21,211
but yeah.

5057
02:03:21,211 --> 02:03:22,560
I mean those are basically the issues.

5058
02:03:22,780 --> 02:03:23,970
Like you're way too much.

5059
02:03:23,971 --> 02:03:25,440
You're not like involved in or whatever.

5060
02:03:25,950 --> 02:03:26,783
Yeah.

5061
02:03:27,460 --> 02:03:28,293
So it was that way.

5062
02:03:28,510 --> 02:03:29,081
So it was chicks.

5063
02:03:29,081 --> 02:03:29,481
They want you,

5064
02:03:29,481 --> 02:03:30,314
they're greedy.

5065
02:03:30,360 --> 02:03:30,910
Yeah.

5066
02:03:30,910 --> 02:03:31,960
Once you give them some good deck,

5067
02:03:31,990 --> 02:03:32,830
they want you all the time.

5068
02:03:33,290 --> 02:03:34,123
I don't know if that was,

5069
02:03:34,510 --> 02:03:35,291
and it wasn't a problem.

5070
02:03:35,291 --> 02:03:36,124
It's probably not

5071
02:03:39,250 --> 02:03:40,083
your best though.

5072
02:03:40,090 --> 02:03:41,110
I was trying super hard.

5073
02:03:41,800 --> 02:03:42,633
Super hard.

5074
02:03:42,940 --> 02:03:43,773
Thanks for being honest.

5075
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:45,361
Listen,

5076
02:03:45,361 --> 02:03:45,971
cat dude,

5077
02:03:45,971 --> 02:03:46,870
you're a fascinating guy.

5078
02:03:46,900 --> 02:03:47,071
I,

5079
02:03:47,071 --> 02:03:47,561
I think,

5080
02:03:47,561 --> 02:03:48,070
um,

5081
02:03:48,070 --> 02:03:50,860
I think what you're doing
is really a very unusual,

5082
02:03:50,861 --> 02:03:51,091
and I'm,

5083
02:03:51,091 --> 02:03:51,340
I'm,

5084
02:03:51,340 --> 02:03:54,940
I'm always glad when I meet someone who's
doing something completely different,

5085
02:03:55,260 --> 02:03:55,580
you know,

5086
02:03:55,580 --> 02:03:56,700
different than me or,

5087
02:03:56,701 --> 02:03:56,890
you know,

5088
02:03:56,890 --> 02:04:00,640
it's one of the coolest things about
this podcast is that we can sit down with

5089
02:04:00,641 --> 02:04:01,091
people that,

5090
02:04:01,091 --> 02:04:01,300
I mean,

5091
02:04:01,300 --> 02:04:02,920
I probably would never
meet you in real life.

5092
02:04:02,950 --> 02:04:03,190
I mean,

5093
02:04:03,190 --> 02:04:04,540
maybe we exchange emails.

5094
02:04:04,541 --> 02:04:05,290
We have a little,

5095
02:04:05,290 --> 02:04:08,950
to be able to sit down face to face with
you and have a certain conversation for

5096
02:04:08,951 --> 02:04:09,491
whatever reason,

5097
02:04:09,491 --> 02:04:12,010
it only exists because of
a medium to display it.

5098
02:04:12,040 --> 02:04:12,480
You know,

5099
02:04:12,480 --> 02:04:12,670
it's,

5100
02:04:12,670 --> 02:04:13,840
it's really interesting.

5101
02:04:14,290 --> 02:04:14,791
I think it's,

5102
02:04:14,791 --> 02:04:15,520
um,

5103
02:04:15,520 --> 02:04:17,260
it's just important,

5104
02:04:17,261 --> 02:04:20,410
I think for a human being to realize that
there's a lot of different ways to be

5105
02:04:20,411 --> 02:04:21,244
a person.

5106
02:04:21,310 --> 02:04:23,320
So a lot of different people out there,

5107
02:04:23,500 --> 02:04:23,741
you know,

5108
02:04:23,741 --> 02:04:27,850
you probably would not be happy
if you were a singer in a band,

5109
02:04:28,230 --> 02:04:29,063
you know,

5110
02:04:29,190 --> 02:04:30,023
horrible.

5111
02:04:30,230 --> 02:04:32,290
Nobody else would be
happy either if be like,

5112
02:04:32,291 --> 02:04:33,124
oh no,

5113
02:04:33,280 --> 02:04:34,113
but you know what I'm saying?

5114
02:04:34,510 --> 02:04:35,343
That's their dream.

5115
02:04:35,350 --> 02:04:37,060
They're in front of the
mirror with a hairbrush.

5116
02:04:37,270 --> 02:04:38,103
You know,

5117
02:04:38,350 --> 02:04:39,131
it's funny you say that.

5118
02:04:39,131 --> 02:04:40,390
Like I actually,

5119
02:04:40,391 --> 02:04:42,800
I got invited to speak at
my old high school to a,

5120
02:04:42,820 --> 02:04:45,330
to tell the kids I was don't climb rocks.

5121
02:04:45,350 --> 02:04:48,880
And I was in gifted and talented type
program where everybody goes and becomes a

5122
02:04:48,881 --> 02:04:49,714
doctor or whatever.

5123
02:04:49,930 --> 02:04:50,740
And um,

5124
02:04:50,740 --> 02:04:53,110
they invited me there to speak to tell
the kids that they don't have to go to

5125
02:04:53,111 --> 02:04:53,530
college,

5126
02:04:53,530 --> 02:04:56,440
that if they want they can just go and
live their dream and do their thing and

5127
02:04:56,441 --> 02:04:56,950
whatever.

5128
02:04:56,950 --> 02:04:59,800
So it was actually a super satisfying
for me to go back to my old high school.

5129
02:04:59,801 --> 02:05:00,634
It'd be like

5130
02:05:02,240 --> 02:05:02,650
marijuana,

5131
02:05:02,650 --> 02:05:04,750
just like a high school in Sacramento.

5132
02:05:05,360 --> 02:05:06,160
Wow.

5133
02:05:06,160 --> 02:05:07,370
What a cool program mean.

5134
02:05:07,570 --> 02:05:07,820
Well,

5135
02:05:07,820 --> 02:05:09,070
it's the international baccalaureate.

5136
02:05:09,071 --> 02:05:10,210
It's kind of like AP program,

5137
02:05:10,211 --> 02:05:11,140
but kind of like high end,

5138
02:05:11,141 --> 02:05:12,220
like you know,

5139
02:05:12,310 --> 02:05:13,210
academic program.

5140
02:05:13,270 --> 02:05:13,991
So this is,

5141
02:05:13,991 --> 02:05:14,410
um,

5142
02:05:14,410 --> 02:05:15,820
not specific to that area.

5143
02:05:15,821 --> 02:05:18,100
This is a national program
where the program is national,

5144
02:05:18,101 --> 02:05:20,380
but the one that is in
that specific high school,

5145
02:05:20,381 --> 02:05:22,750
it's like quite good and they do
really well nationally and everything.

5146
02:05:22,751 --> 02:05:23,500
And so,

5147
02:05:23,500 --> 02:05:23,950
and it's,

5148
02:05:23,950 --> 02:05:24,191
you know,

5149
02:05:24,191 --> 02:05:25,150
it's just where I went to high school,

5150
02:05:25,151 --> 02:05:28,300
but so one of my old teachers ask me to
come back and tell the kids that like,

5151
02:05:28,600 --> 02:05:28,811
you know,

5152
02:05:28,811 --> 02:05:31,030
even though your parents are
expecting you to become a doctor,

5153
02:05:31,040 --> 02:05:33,310
like you don't have to like
you can just follow your dream,

5154
02:05:33,311 --> 02:05:34,061
travel the world,

5155
02:05:34,061 --> 02:05:34,960
do what you love to do,

5156
02:05:34,990 --> 02:05:35,823
that kind of thing.

5157
02:05:36,040 --> 02:05:36,431
It was like,

5158
02:05:36,431 --> 02:05:38,740
it was very satisfying to go
back and like have that talk,

5159
02:05:38,741 --> 02:05:38,981
you know,

5160
02:05:38,981 --> 02:05:40,900
after having gone through
the program and been like,

5161
02:05:40,930 --> 02:05:42,190
oh I need to go to university.

5162
02:05:42,191 --> 02:05:44,110
I got to get my degree know it'd be like,

5163
02:05:44,111 --> 02:05:45,040
you know what I mean?

5164
02:05:45,070 --> 02:05:46,470
I mean I think that's great and I think I,

5165
02:05:46,471 --> 02:05:47,920
and I really value education,

5166
02:05:47,921 --> 02:05:48,754
but like,

5167
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:49,301
you know,

5168
02:05:49,301 --> 02:05:50,740
sometimes you just kind
of do what you love to do.

5169
02:05:50,940 --> 02:05:51,090
Yeah.

5170
02:05:51,090 --> 02:05:52,290
I value education as well,

5171
02:05:52,291 --> 02:05:55,380
but I completely agree with you and I
had the same issues coming out of high

5172
02:05:55,381 --> 02:05:55,711
school.

5173
02:05:55,711 --> 02:05:58,500
I went to college just so that
people didn't think I was a loser.

5174
02:05:58,620 --> 02:05:58,801
Yeah,

5175
02:05:58,801 --> 02:05:59,311
exactly.

5176
02:05:59,311 --> 02:06:00,070
Exactly.

5177
02:06:00,070 --> 02:06:03,210
It was really all I was competing
in taekwondo tournament's back then.

5178
02:06:03,211 --> 02:06:04,950
There was obviously no
money in that either.

5179
02:06:04,980 --> 02:06:06,990
But that's all I wanted to do.

5180
02:06:07,020 --> 02:06:09,510
And so I had to figure out
some way to not be a loser.

5181
02:06:09,570 --> 02:06:12,090
So I started going to
college while I was doing it.

5182
02:06:12,120 --> 02:06:12,631
Oh it was doing,

5183
02:06:12,631 --> 02:06:13,680
it's fucking up my training.

5184
02:06:14,050 --> 02:06:17,490
Just taking away time that I could
be napping instead of that I could be

5185
02:06:17,510 --> 02:06:17,910
napping.

5186
02:06:17,910 --> 02:06:19,080
When when you train that hard,

5187
02:06:19,930 --> 02:06:24,810
when you training for taekwondo tournament
especially that's like I didn't party

5188
02:06:24,811 --> 02:06:26,080
at all when I was in high school.

5189
02:06:26,110 --> 02:06:28,650
I didn't do and do it a couple of times.

5190
02:06:28,650 --> 02:06:30,480
Randomly gotten drunk at a party,

5191
02:06:30,481 --> 02:06:32,100
like over my entire high school career.

5192
02:06:32,570 --> 02:06:34,830
Maybe smoked pot like twice
or something like that.

5193
02:06:35,100 --> 02:06:38,480
But for the most part throughout high
school I was terrified that I was going to

5194
02:06:38,481 --> 02:06:40,290
get killed in a tournament and smashed.

5195
02:06:40,500 --> 02:06:43,920
So all I was doing it was just like
eating healthy and drinking water and you

5196
02:06:43,921 --> 02:06:44,041
know,

5197
02:06:44,041 --> 02:06:47,490
try to sleep as much as possible and
written and training like a demon.

5198
02:06:47,790 --> 02:06:52,230
So I went to that feeling of like
being out of high school and like,

5199
02:06:52,290 --> 02:06:52,801
this is no,

5200
02:06:52,801 --> 02:06:53,820
there's no future in this.

5201
02:06:53,821 --> 02:06:54,091
I was like,

5202
02:06:54,091 --> 02:06:54,720
what is this?

5203
02:06:54,720 --> 02:06:55,321
What am I doing?

5204
02:06:55,321 --> 02:06:56,300
Like this obsession,

5205
02:06:56,310 --> 02:06:57,210
it doesn't go anywhere.

5206
02:06:57,540 --> 02:06:59,070
It eventually worked out though.

5207
02:06:59,140 --> 02:07:00,420
That's an exactly.

5208
02:07:00,570 --> 02:07:02,670
But the feeling that I had,

5209
02:07:02,671 --> 02:07:05,100
that feeling of uncertainty was,

5210
02:07:05,101 --> 02:07:05,710
um,

5211
02:07:05,710 --> 02:07:06,151
it's,

5212
02:07:06,151 --> 02:07:09,210
I think it's so important to let other
people know that you had that same

5213
02:07:09,211 --> 02:07:09,631
feeling.

5214
02:07:09,631 --> 02:07:13,350
It's so important to do what you did
and get in front of his kids and go,

5215
02:07:13,351 --> 02:07:14,184
listen,

5216
02:07:14,220 --> 02:07:16,890
nobody has a map of where the
fuck you're supposed to go.

5217
02:07:17,250 --> 02:07:18,480
You could go anywhere.

5218
02:07:18,510 --> 02:07:20,100
And there's a lot of different
ways to make a living.

5219
02:07:20,101 --> 02:07:20,341
And if,

5220
02:07:20,341 --> 02:07:22,470
and if you see someone
who's doing something,

5221
02:07:22,620 --> 02:07:26,760
whether they're an author or a
painter or they're flying planes,

5222
02:07:26,910 --> 02:07:27,960
whatever it is,

5223
02:07:27,961 --> 02:07:29,280
if someone's doing it,

5224
02:07:29,520 --> 02:07:30,660
you can do it too.

5225
02:07:31,380 --> 02:07:32,340
It can be done

5226
02:07:32,550 --> 02:07:33,500
or you can do your own,

5227
02:07:33,501 --> 02:07:34,051
but he's doing it,

5228
02:07:34,051 --> 02:07:34,341
you know,

5229
02:07:34,341 --> 02:07:35,230
you have no one's doing it.

5230
02:07:35,231 --> 02:07:35,741
You can be like,

5231
02:07:35,741 --> 02:07:36,160
that

5232
02:07:36,160 --> 02:07:37,630
is what I want to do and God it,

5233
02:07:37,631 --> 02:07:38,240
I'm going to do it.

5234
02:07:38,240 --> 02:07:39,400
As long as it's logical,

5235
02:07:39,440 --> 02:07:42,430
unless someone needed to take you to
a doctor until you're fucking crazy,

5236
02:07:42,530 --> 02:07:43,600
you can't actually fly.

5237
02:07:44,150 --> 02:07:44,550
Right.

5238
02:07:44,550 --> 02:07:45,383
There's a little of that.

5239
02:07:45,740 --> 02:07:46,480
Yeah.

5240
02:07:46,480 --> 02:07:47,410
But you know,

5241
02:07:47,770 --> 02:07:50,030
all extreme examples of it's,

5242
02:07:50,050 --> 02:07:51,610
I think it's so important to do that.

5243
02:07:51,740 --> 02:07:52,130
It's so,

5244
02:07:52,130 --> 02:07:53,980
so important to give kids.

5245
02:07:54,370 --> 02:07:54,611
I mean,

5246
02:07:54,611 --> 02:07:59,080
how many times in your life have you seen
something that was inspiring that sort

5247
02:07:59,081 --> 02:08:01,750
of like pushed you and
they give you like this,

5248
02:08:01,751 --> 02:08:03,250
this feeling of confidence.

5249
02:08:03,251 --> 02:08:03,730
Like it was like,

5250
02:08:03,730 --> 02:08:05,020
Oh okay that guy did that.

5251
02:08:05,290 --> 02:08:07,050
God that this world is Kinda nutty.

5252
02:08:07,090 --> 02:08:09,580
There's a lot of different shit.

5253
02:08:09,880 --> 02:08:12,560
I think a guy like you is like
a really important example that,

5254
02:08:13,530 --> 02:08:14,363
yeah.

5255
02:08:14,480 --> 02:08:14,950
Maybe.

5256
02:08:14,950 --> 02:08:16,750
What did it feel like to do that speech?

5257
02:08:16,751 --> 02:08:17,584
Did you shit your pants?

5258
02:08:19,120 --> 02:08:19,391
I mean,

5259
02:08:19,391 --> 02:08:20,410
I'm talking to high school games.

5260
02:08:20,420 --> 02:08:20,741
I can't,

5261
02:08:20,741 --> 02:08:21,191
it's not a,

5262
02:08:21,191 --> 02:08:22,240
you can't be that nervous.

5263
02:08:22,580 --> 02:08:22,840
You know,

5264
02:08:22,840 --> 02:08:27,010
they're all like 16 and I'll try and
get laid except they're never going to,

5265
02:08:27,011 --> 02:08:29,220
cause they're all like little girl nerds.

5266
02:08:29,280 --> 02:08:29,860
Yeah.

5267
02:08:29,860 --> 02:08:32,170
That's what Brian comes in Florence.

5268
02:08:32,180 --> 02:08:33,790
So long as they're willing
to do this on film,

5269
02:08:33,791 --> 02:08:34,624
we can get them all ready.

5270
02:08:35,450 --> 02:08:36,550
It is not a problem.

5271
02:08:36,551 --> 02:08:38,860
I don't think that's really
the school to recruit for uh,

5272
02:08:39,060 --> 02:08:39,760
for porn.

5273
02:08:39,760 --> 02:08:40,150
No.

5274
02:08:40,150 --> 02:08:44,530
See you say that but say all want to get
laid so I don't see what you're saying.

5275
02:08:44,560 --> 02:08:46,540
As long as their penises and vaginas work,

5276
02:08:46,570 --> 02:08:48,010
I think we've got a problem there.

5277
02:08:48,060 --> 02:08:48,480
Yeah.

5278
02:08:48,480 --> 02:08:49,313
And we could solve it,

5279
02:08:50,680 --> 02:08:51,220
right Brian?

5280
02:08:51,220 --> 02:08:52,053
Yes.

5281
02:08:53,500 --> 02:08:57,340
That could be something that could derail
a of the career of an inspiring person

5282
02:08:57,341 --> 02:08:59,710
though he had too much high
end pussy at a young age.

5283
02:09:00,110 --> 02:09:01,840
It's like winning the lottery,

5284
02:09:02,080 --> 02:09:02,800
you know?

5285
02:09:02,800 --> 02:09:04,360
Cause if you won the lottery you like,

5286
02:09:04,361 --> 02:09:05,230
why would I work?

5287
02:09:05,231 --> 02:09:07,520
Why would I be inspired
to go do things right?

5288
02:09:07,530 --> 02:09:08,080
And I totally like,

5289
02:09:08,080 --> 02:09:09,040
I have this free money,

5290
02:09:09,041 --> 02:09:10,700
I'm going to play Xbox until I die.

5291
02:09:10,730 --> 02:09:11,320
Yeah.

5292
02:09:11,320 --> 02:09:12,550
It can kill motivation.

5293
02:09:12,940 --> 02:09:16,330
I think that also can happen if you
fuck above your head at a young age.

5294
02:09:16,890 --> 02:09:18,690
I never had that problem ruin you.

5295
02:09:18,750 --> 02:09:19,960
Still extremely motivated.

5296
02:09:21,730 --> 02:09:24,580
It can ruin you if you've
got a hold of some terror.

5297
02:09:24,581 --> 02:09:25,630
Patrick type chick.

5298
02:09:25,631 --> 02:09:26,920
When you were 18 years old,

5299
02:09:26,960 --> 02:09:28,270
you really think you could survive that.

5300
02:09:28,720 --> 02:09:29,441
That guy would wreck you.

5301
02:09:29,441 --> 02:09:30,520
That would be all you would think about.

5302
02:09:30,521 --> 02:09:35,000
You'd be on those climbing
peaks and instead of thinking
of your next foot hold,

5303
02:09:35,001 --> 02:09:38,620
you'd be thinking of her mouth on your
and your penis and then you could get

5304
02:09:38,621 --> 02:09:39,610
really problematic.

5305
02:09:40,090 --> 02:09:40,930
It wouldn't be focused,

5306
02:09:40,931 --> 02:09:42,250
he wouldn't keep your eyes on the prize.

5307
02:09:42,790 --> 02:09:46,360
The thrill of getting to the top but
somehow or another beat dwarfed by the

5308
02:09:46,361 --> 02:09:47,290
thrill of her mouth.

5309
02:09:47,291 --> 02:09:47,990
By the fee.

5310
02:09:47,990 --> 02:09:48,550
Yeah.

5311
02:09:48,550 --> 02:09:51,370
The memory of the thrill of
that knowledge that you know,

5312
02:09:51,371 --> 02:09:54,170
all you have to do is get in the same
room with her and shut the door and you'll

5313
02:09:54,190 --> 02:09:55,420
be having sex with her.

5314
02:09:55,840 --> 02:09:56,770
Is that all it takes?

5315
02:09:56,860 --> 02:09:57,700
No frigging.

5316
02:09:57,710 --> 02:09:58,990
Before she was your girlfriend?

5317
02:10:00,480 --> 02:10:01,660
I think she's actually married now.

5318
02:10:02,140 --> 02:10:05,230
I didn't use her and exists as an
example because she has loose morals.

5319
02:10:05,560 --> 02:10:06,940
Just exactly hot.

5320
02:10:07,720 --> 02:10:08,440
She's very nice.

5321
02:10:08,440 --> 02:10:08,651
Great.

5322
02:10:08,651 --> 02:10:09,200
Next person.

5323
02:10:09,200 --> 02:10:09,550
Yeah,

5324
02:10:09,550 --> 02:10:10,240
we've uh,

5325
02:10:10,240 --> 02:10:10,980
we've met before.

5326
02:10:10,980 --> 02:10:11,620
It's really nice,

5327
02:10:11,620 --> 02:10:12,161
but she's married.

5328
02:10:12,161 --> 02:10:13,000
She's got a baby and everything,

5329
02:10:13,030 --> 02:10:14,100
so I don't think you can fuck her up,

5330
02:10:14,110 --> 02:10:16,660
but I'm saying if you did
when you were 18 yeah,

5331
02:10:16,661 --> 02:10:18,940
it'd be a disaster for
your future productivity.

5332
02:10:19,120 --> 02:10:19,631
It could be,

5333
02:10:19,631 --> 02:10:19,951
right?

5334
02:10:19,951 --> 02:10:20,350
Yeah.

5335
02:10:20,350 --> 02:10:23,770
How do you jerk off when you're
in a tent and it's like you're,

5336
02:10:23,780 --> 02:10:24,790
you're in the middle of nowhere.

5337
02:10:24,791 --> 02:10:25,440
I like,

5338
02:10:25,440 --> 02:10:27,040
did you just save it until you get,

5339
02:10:27,190 --> 02:10:32,190
get back to civilization then you do the
same thing you do at home in a tent out

5340
02:10:32,261 --> 02:10:33,094
there hiking?

5341
02:10:33,290 --> 02:10:33,481
Yeah.

5342
02:10:33,481 --> 02:10:34,240
I mean why not?

5343
02:10:34,240 --> 02:10:35,660
I don't think a joke often tense.

5344
02:10:36,050 --> 02:10:36,711
As I say,

5345
02:10:36,711 --> 02:10:37,460
it's waterproof.

5346
02:10:37,460 --> 02:10:40,250
If you lived in a tent
or confident 10 yeah.

5347
02:10:40,490 --> 02:10:40,671
Yeah,

5348
02:10:40,671 --> 02:10:41,151
for sure.

5349
02:10:41,151 --> 02:10:42,260
It gets to a certain
point where you're like,

5350
02:10:42,261 --> 02:10:42,471
all right,

5351
02:10:42,471 --> 02:10:45,440
I've got to just do this just
for maintenance for sure.

5352
02:10:45,441 --> 02:10:46,460
You've got to keep the pipes clean,

5353
02:10:46,520 --> 02:10:47,350
but it's all,

5354
02:10:47,350 --> 02:10:47,620
uh,

5355
02:10:47,620 --> 02:10:48,650
it's all on memory.

5356
02:10:48,830 --> 02:10:50,960
Do you bring like porn on a
phone or something like that?

5357
02:10:50,961 --> 02:10:51,794
Set it up.

5358
02:10:52,690 --> 02:10:55,360
Memory is kind of the way
I think or drawling it.

5359
02:10:56,360 --> 02:10:57,320
Kate fadings.

5360
02:10:58,910 --> 02:11:00,740
Have there ever been
pornographic cave paintings?

5361
02:11:00,810 --> 02:11:01,643
If her phone,

5362
02:11:01,880 --> 02:11:02,800
I sure there must be.

5363
02:11:02,840 --> 02:11:02,990
Well,

5364
02:11:02,990 --> 02:11:03,740
I mean porn.

5365
02:11:03,740 --> 02:11:04,573
Yeah.

5366
02:11:04,640 --> 02:11:05,473
Yeah.

5367
02:11:05,600 --> 02:11:09,500
It's interesting the idea that these
cave paintings represented reality cause

5368
02:11:09,501 --> 02:11:11,090
there's a lot of weird
shit that they drew.

5369
02:11:11,120 --> 02:11:16,120
Then like you know a lot of us ufologists
and big foot people look to as proof

5370
02:11:17,300 --> 02:11:19,040
of the fact these people experienced here.

5371
02:11:20,600 --> 02:11:22,830
Imagine if you looked at
all of human arteries.

5372
02:11:23,030 --> 02:11:23,420
Yeah.

5373
02:11:23,420 --> 02:11:24,080
Sketchy.

5374
02:11:24,080 --> 02:11:24,913
Sketchy.

5375
02:11:25,220 --> 02:11:27,670
So like so like you know what,

5376
02:11:27,680 --> 02:11:30,320
there was a real Mickey mouse like
Mickey mouse and drill because there's a

5377
02:11:30,321 --> 02:11:31,280
drawing of Mickey Mouse.

5378
02:11:31,281 --> 02:11:32,360
Like that doesn't make any sense.

5379
02:11:32,660 --> 02:11:35,390
Like there was these guys
I watched finding big foot.

5380
02:11:35,570 --> 02:11:38,600
We've had the bigfoot hunter
Bobo on the show before.

5381
02:11:38,840 --> 02:11:40,310
Fascinating conversation.

5382
02:11:40,960 --> 02:11:41,600
It's the budget.

5383
02:11:41,600 --> 02:11:43,250
He's like honestly hunting big foot.

5384
02:11:43,490 --> 02:11:44,323
Yes.

5385
02:11:44,360 --> 02:11:47,020
I mean he's legit in the sense
that he's honestly honey big foot.

5386
02:11:48,170 --> 02:11:48,561
Oh yeah.

5387
02:11:48,561 --> 02:11:50,450
He believes he's had experiences.

5388
02:11:50,800 --> 02:11:51,500
Yeah.

5389
02:11:51,500 --> 02:11:52,333
Is he a Weirdo?

5390
02:11:52,610 --> 02:11:53,480
This is a little weird.

5391
02:11:53,540 --> 02:11:53,841
Yeah.

5392
02:11:53,841 --> 02:11:55,760
He could benefit from
Brian's program as well.

5393
02:11:56,240 --> 02:11:57,073
Prize

5394
02:11:58,940 --> 02:11:59,860
Brian's up,

5395
02:12:01,640 --> 02:12:02,270
whatever.

5396
02:12:02,270 --> 02:12:03,080
He's a,

5397
02:12:03,080 --> 02:12:03,620
but he's,

5398
02:12:03,620 --> 02:12:07,730
his life is dedicated to finding Sasquatch
apparently saw it once or twice or

5399
02:12:07,731 --> 02:12:08,361
something like that.

5400
02:12:08,361 --> 02:12:12,350
And it's been going on these expeditions
and they go looking for places where,

5401
02:12:12,351 --> 02:12:12,640
you know,

5402
02:12:12,640 --> 02:12:13,190
paypal,

5403
02:12:13,190 --> 02:12:14,023
what's

5404
02:12:15,370 --> 02:12:16,850
lot of fuckery involved.

5405
02:12:16,910 --> 02:12:17,491
But the,

5406
02:12:17,491 --> 02:12:20,570
the reason people keep going is because
there was an animal called gigantic

5407
02:12:20,610 --> 02:12:23,060
Pythagoras that lived as recently
as a hundred thousand years ago.

5408
02:12:23,070 --> 02:12:23,990
That was an eight foot,

5409
02:12:24,140 --> 02:12:28,300
10 foot tall by Peto primate
and enormous Animal Dakota.

5410
02:12:28,340 --> 02:12:30,050
The Co existed with humans,

5411
02:12:30,590 --> 02:12:30,861
you know,

5412
02:12:30,861 --> 02:12:33,050
just like we drew wooly mammoths.

5413
02:12:33,051 --> 02:12:34,190
This is a real animal.

5414
02:12:34,250 --> 02:12:38,000
So when they have these cave
paintings and drawings of this big,

5415
02:12:38,030 --> 02:12:38,481
tall,

5416
02:12:38,481 --> 02:12:39,320
hairy thing,

5417
02:12:39,650 --> 02:12:44,630
it may very well have been something that
existed and died off because it lived

5418
02:12:44,631 --> 02:12:48,620
in Asia and must much like people came
to North America following the Bering

5419
02:12:48,620 --> 02:12:48,620
strait.

5420
02:12:48,620 --> 02:12:49,130
Yeah.

5421
02:12:49,130 --> 02:12:49,401
It,

5422
02:12:49,401 --> 02:12:49,640
uh,

5423
02:12:49,640 --> 02:12:51,470
it also could have done
the exact same thing.

5424
02:12:52,010 --> 02:12:53,090
They think it's really possible,

5425
02:12:53,091 --> 02:12:55,760
especially because of the density of
the forest in the Pacific northwest.

5426
02:12:56,030 --> 02:12:56,421
In fact,

5427
02:12:56,421 --> 02:12:57,081
Jane Goodall,

5428
02:12:57,081 --> 02:12:58,070
the primatologist,

5429
02:12:58,071 --> 02:12:58,730
she,

5430
02:12:58,730 --> 02:13:00,530
she's pretty certain that there's,

5431
02:13:00,560 --> 02:13:01,030
um,

5432
02:13:01,030 --> 02:13:01,460
a,

5433
02:13:01,460 --> 02:13:02,140
a,

5434
02:13:02,140 --> 02:13:05,260
an actual undiscovered primate
living in the Pacific northwest.

5435
02:13:05,270 --> 02:13:06,800
She said she believes 100%.

5436
02:13:07,220 --> 02:13:07,521
She said,

5437
02:13:07,521 --> 02:13:07,790
John,

5438
02:13:07,790 --> 02:13:08,810
I'm absolutely certain,

5439
02:13:08,811 --> 02:13:09,321
or something like that.

5440
02:13:09,321 --> 02:13:10,250
I forget her exact quote,

5441
02:13:10,400 --> 02:13:12,710
but I thought coming from
a primatologist like her,

5442
02:13:13,190 --> 02:13:14,450
that's something to be considered.

5443
02:13:14,540 --> 02:13:19,340
But it also could be romantic confirmation
bias and now she could just be

5444
02:13:19,520 --> 02:13:22,460
psyched about monkeys and hoping
there's a big one out there.

5445
02:13:22,461 --> 02:13:23,190
And that's how,

5446
02:13:23,190 --> 02:13:24,950
what finger blast herself
to sleep every night.

5447
02:13:24,980 --> 02:13:26,600
Thinking about this big AP in Rio.

5448
02:13:26,601 --> 02:13:27,380
Catch him,

5449
02:13:27,380 --> 02:13:27,980
please.

5450
02:13:27,980 --> 02:13:28,521
Proved me.

5451
02:13:28,521 --> 02:13:29,354
Right.

5452
02:13:29,420 --> 02:13:30,080
Oh,

5453
02:13:30,080 --> 02:13:30,913
that's how she,

5454
02:13:31,300 --> 02:13:32,050
maybe not,

5455
02:13:32,050 --> 02:13:35,050
I don't think I've ever heard anybody
talking about Jane Goodall in a sexual

5456
02:13:35,051 --> 02:13:35,620
sense.

5457
02:13:35,620 --> 02:13:37,450
That's how I got in
trouble in science class.

5458
02:13:37,480 --> 02:13:37,900
Um,

5459
02:13:37,900 --> 02:13:38,531
there was a,

5460
02:13:38,531 --> 02:13:39,080
uh,

5461
02:13:39,080 --> 02:13:39,700
there was a,

5462
02:13:39,700 --> 02:13:39,961
a,

5463
02:13:39,961 --> 02:13:40,930
a woman,

5464
02:13:40,980 --> 02:13:41,320
uh,

5465
02:13:41,320 --> 02:13:41,711
who was,

5466
02:13:41,711 --> 02:13:41,861
uh,

5467
02:13:41,861 --> 02:13:43,430
this science teacher that was a,

5468
02:13:43,900 --> 02:13:47,230
this a kid who was a high school
quarterback who was like really smart kid.

5469
02:13:47,380 --> 02:13:48,213
He's very,

5470
02:13:48,250 --> 02:13:51,400
very charming and charismatic and he
would flirt with all the teachers to kind

5471
02:13:51,401 --> 02:13:52,510
of try to get better grades.

5472
02:13:52,900 --> 02:13:53,301
So,

5473
02:13:53,301 --> 02:13:53,441
uh,

5474
02:13:53,441 --> 02:13:55,210
I got to class early and,

5475
02:13:55,211 --> 02:13:55,451
uh,

5476
02:13:55,451 --> 02:13:55,871
I had,

5477
02:13:55,871 --> 02:13:56,040
uh,

5478
02:13:56,040 --> 02:13:57,370
I drew a picture of him,

5479
02:13:57,371 --> 02:13:58,240
Bang her,

5480
02:13:58,540 --> 02:14:00,220
and she was screaming out,

5481
02:14:00,270 --> 02:14:00,970
do it,

5482
02:14:00,970 --> 02:14:01,571
do it to me.

5483
02:14:01,571 --> 02:14:02,590
Monkey style,

5484
02:14:02,591 --> 02:14:03,251
like my hero,

5485
02:14:03,251 --> 02:14:04,150
Jane Goodall.

5486
02:14:04,510 --> 02:14:08,980
And I like when I got in trouble
or that I could see that.

5487
02:14:09,610 --> 02:14:10,000
Yeah,

5488
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:10,400
I got try.

5489
02:14:10,400 --> 02:14:11,010
That's what,

5490
02:14:11,010 --> 02:14:12,250
before I became a comedian,

5491
02:14:12,280 --> 02:14:17,280
most of my comedy ideas were expressed
from cartoons because I was sort of a

5492
02:14:17,620 --> 02:14:18,041
drawer.

5493
02:14:18,041 --> 02:14:22,390
I drew an illustrator when I was young
and I used to do a lot of comic book type

5494
02:14:22,391 --> 02:14:26,350
stuff and so I would draw like teachers
doing something fucked up and get in

5495
02:14:26,351 --> 02:14:27,184
trouble.

5496
02:14:27,670 --> 02:14:28,540
You could do this one teacher,

5497
02:14:28,541 --> 02:14:28,981
she just,

5498
02:14:28,981 --> 02:14:30,790
where a lot of makeups I
drove without her makeup,

5499
02:14:30,800 --> 02:14:31,690
but she was a werewolf.

5500
02:14:32,270 --> 02:14:33,400
It's fucking stupid.

5501
02:14:33,820 --> 02:14:34,301
But they got,

5502
02:14:34,301 --> 02:14:35,560
they suspended me for that.

5503
02:14:35,990 --> 02:14:36,410
You know,

5504
02:14:36,410 --> 02:14:39,430
some shit that you would get on the
Internet every day and you would laugh at

5505
02:14:39,431 --> 02:14:39,521
it.

5506
02:14:39,521 --> 02:14:41,530
You would l o l l U l.

5507
02:14:41,531 --> 02:14:43,900
Z back in the day.

5508
02:14:43,960 --> 02:14:44,320
Yeah.

5509
02:14:44,320 --> 02:14:45,153
Back in the day.

5510
02:14:46,180 --> 02:14:47,940
Kinda in trouble faster.

5511
02:14:48,130 --> 02:14:48,351
It's,

5512
02:14:48,351 --> 02:14:49,480
did you get in trouble
at all in high school?

5513
02:14:49,510 --> 02:14:50,343
You know,

5514
02:14:50,440 --> 02:14:51,250
you're a good kid.

5515
02:14:51,250 --> 02:14:52,081
I never got less than,

5516
02:14:52,081 --> 02:14:52,191
than,

5517
02:14:52,191 --> 02:14:54,610
they never got less than an a in anything.

5518
02:14:54,820 --> 02:14:55,210
Nope.

5519
02:14:55,210 --> 02:14:56,043
Wow.

5520
02:14:56,440 --> 02:14:58,210
I graduate if I get 4.7 or something.

5521
02:14:58,240 --> 02:14:59,080
That's amazing.

5522
02:14:59,120 --> 02:15:03,460
So and you went from there to college and
just like this is just not stimulating

5523
02:15:03,461 --> 02:15:04,450
enough and not,

5524
02:15:04,630 --> 02:15:04,860
yeah,

5525
02:15:04,860 --> 02:15:05,681
just wasn't interested,

5526
02:15:05,681 --> 02:15:06,130
you know.

5527
02:15:06,130 --> 02:15:06,390
Wow.

5528
02:15:06,390 --> 02:15:07,780
It's like I would rather be homeless.

5529
02:15:08,410 --> 02:15:09,280
Wow.

5530
02:15:09,390 --> 02:15:10,223
Yeah.

5531
02:15:10,570 --> 02:15:14,020
Do you anticipate keeping
this lifestyle until you die?

5532
02:15:14,090 --> 02:15:14,621
Traveling,

5533
02:15:14,621 --> 02:15:15,550
living in a van,

5534
02:15:15,580 --> 02:15:16,900
climbing whenever you can?

5535
02:15:17,930 --> 02:15:18,111
Yeah.

5536
02:15:18,111 --> 02:15:18,944
Well maybe,

5537
02:15:19,880 --> 02:15:23,000
maybe not the full time travel until I
die just because at some point I'm sure I

5538
02:15:23,001 --> 02:15:23,960
wanted to like settle down.

5539
02:15:24,050 --> 02:15:27,950
Do you think you'll ever move
up to a mobile home right now?

5540
02:15:27,951 --> 02:15:29,390
I'll probably get a real
house at some point.

5541
02:15:29,450 --> 02:15:30,231
At some point in time.

5542
02:15:30,231 --> 02:15:30,530
Yeah.

5543
02:15:30,530 --> 02:15:33,440
The thing is it's hard to find a
place that I'd want to live full time.

5544
02:15:33,570 --> 02:15:34,403
You ever been in boulder?

5545
02:15:34,670 --> 02:15:34,881
Yeah,

5546
02:15:34,881 --> 02:15:35,430
I have.

5547
02:15:35,430 --> 02:15:36,270
The folder is actually,

5548
02:15:36,271 --> 02:15:36,500
yeah.

5549
02:15:36,500 --> 02:15:39,080
That's like the heart of climbing in the
u s a bunch of climbing companies are

5550
02:15:39,081 --> 02:15:39,560
based there.

5551
02:15:39,560 --> 02:15:39,951
Is it really?

5552
02:15:39,951 --> 02:15:41,670
And there's so much climbing
on the front range there.

5553
02:15:41,680 --> 02:15:42,513
They're like,

5554
02:15:42,620 --> 02:15:42,831
yeah.

5555
02:15:42,831 --> 02:15:43,280
That's like,

5556
02:15:43,280 --> 02:15:44,600
that's the heart of us climbing.

5557
02:15:44,870 --> 02:15:45,130
Yeah,

5558
02:15:45,130 --> 02:15:45,501
I was there.

5559
02:15:45,501 --> 02:15:46,334
Someone that died,

5560
02:15:46,550 --> 02:15:49,190
someone fell off one of
those flat fitness and elder.

5561
02:15:49,450 --> 02:15:50,750
He's out of Canyon probably.

5562
02:15:50,751 --> 02:15:51,040
Yeah,

5563
02:15:51,040 --> 02:15:51,651
it was it people,

5564
02:15:51,651 --> 02:15:53,060
I mean a handful of people
die there every year.

5565
02:15:53,060 --> 02:15:53,640
Probably every,

5566
02:15:53,640 --> 02:15:54,180
yeah,

5567
02:15:54,180 --> 02:15:55,013
it seems like it.

5568
02:15:55,490 --> 02:15:56,960
And do you guys look at those people?

5569
02:15:56,980 --> 02:15:58,340
Just people that are just inexperienced,

5570
02:15:58,560 --> 02:16:00,530
shouldn't have January
there's a different,

5571
02:16:00,560 --> 02:16:01,281
I mean there's a,

5572
02:16:01,281 --> 02:16:02,690
there's a publication every year,

5573
02:16:02,691 --> 02:16:05,300
accidents in North American mountaineering
and it's just a list of every

5574
02:16:05,301 --> 02:16:06,500
accident that happened over the year.

5575
02:16:06,501 --> 02:16:08,660
And they have analysis
and causes and you know,

5576
02:16:08,670 --> 02:16:10,190
I mean some accidents
you read and you're like,

5577
02:16:10,191 --> 02:16:11,024
what an idiot,

5578
02:16:11,030 --> 02:16:11,720
you know,

5579
02:16:11,720 --> 02:16:12,553
and then some accidents.

5580
02:16:12,650 --> 02:16:13,483
What have you ever read?

5581
02:16:14,480 --> 02:16:14,930
Uh,

5582
02:16:14,930 --> 02:16:15,321
okay.

5583
02:16:15,321 --> 02:16:16,700
Like the first thing that comes to mind,

5584
02:16:16,701 --> 02:16:19,670
but I've always found just totally
comedic is a odd half dome.

5585
02:16:19,700 --> 02:16:21,980
There's like this long
horizontal traverse where like,

5586
02:16:21,981 --> 02:16:23,840
you basically walk across
this little tiny ledge.

5587
02:16:23,870 --> 02:16:24,681
It's like the photos.

5588
02:16:24,681 --> 02:16:25,880
I don't know if you've
seen any on the internet.

5589
02:16:25,920 --> 02:16:28,370
There's a classic photo of me standing
on this little tiny ledge and it looks

5590
02:16:28,371 --> 02:16:29,200
all crazy.

5591
02:16:29,200 --> 02:16:29,381
But,

5592
02:16:29,381 --> 02:16:29,591
so,

5593
02:16:29,591 --> 02:16:30,424
um,

5594
02:16:30,670 --> 02:16:34,240
if you don't place protection across
the length of the ledge and you fall,

5595
02:16:34,241 --> 02:16:35,710
you're going to just swing like,

5596
02:16:35,770 --> 02:16:36,041
you know,

5597
02:16:36,041 --> 02:16:39,340
I mean it's just like a pendulum straight
across and there's a corner at the

5598
02:16:39,341 --> 02:16:39,880
other end of it.

5599
02:16:39,880 --> 02:16:40,960
So if you swing the distance,

5600
02:16:40,961 --> 02:16:44,170
you're just going to swing into this
corner and just get totally messed up.

5601
02:16:44,620 --> 02:16:45,011
And so,

5602
02:16:45,011 --> 02:16:45,844
um,

5603
02:16:45,880 --> 02:16:46,661
I read an accident,

5604
02:16:46,661 --> 02:16:48,370
it was like a Korean woman climbing,

5605
02:16:48,371 --> 02:16:48,641
you know,

5606
02:16:48,641 --> 02:16:49,780
going big walling or whatever.

5607
02:16:49,781 --> 02:16:53,320
It's like their first wall and she gets
up there and she like takes out the

5608
02:16:53,321 --> 02:16:54,190
piece of production is like,

5609
02:16:54,191 --> 02:16:54,401
well,

5610
02:16:54,401 --> 02:16:57,030
I'm going to take the swing rather
than like crawling across the ledger,

5611
02:16:57,040 --> 02:16:57,281
whatever.

5612
02:16:57,281 --> 02:16:57,791
She's just like,

5613
02:16:57,791 --> 02:16:59,650
takes the swing augers into the corner,

5614
02:16:59,651 --> 02:17:01,660
breaks both their ankles and um,

5615
02:17:02,110 --> 02:17:02,351
you know,

5616
02:17:02,351 --> 02:17:03,184
and you're like,

5617
02:17:03,370 --> 02:17:04,240
what an idiot.

5618
02:17:04,270 --> 02:17:04,511
You know,

5619
02:17:04,511 --> 02:17:05,291
because it's basically like,

5620
02:17:05,291 --> 02:17:08,260
imagine holding onto a rope swing and
looking at a brick wall and being like,

5621
02:17:08,261 --> 02:17:09,700
I'm going to swing into that wall,

5622
02:17:09,730 --> 02:17:10,420
you know,

5623
02:17:10,420 --> 02:17:11,620
with a 90 degree angle.

5624
02:17:11,980 --> 02:17:12,813
Like,

5625
02:17:12,850 --> 02:17:13,683
I mean,

5626
02:17:13,770 --> 02:17:14,200
you know,

5627
02:17:14,200 --> 02:17:15,820
so you read an accident
like that and you're like,

5628
02:17:15,821 --> 02:17:16,870
what was she thinking?

5629
02:17:16,900 --> 02:17:17,800
Because it's like simple,

5630
02:17:17,801 --> 02:17:17,981
you know,

5631
02:17:17,981 --> 02:17:19,180
any kid would be like,

5632
02:17:19,210 --> 02:17:20,500
this looks like it's
going to be a terrible,

5633
02:17:22,540 --> 02:17:23,860
I mean it's pretty simple physics,

5634
02:17:24,250 --> 02:17:24,680
you know.

5635
02:17:24,680 --> 02:17:25,350
But then

5636
02:17:25,350 --> 02:17:28,380
at the other end of the spectrum you
see accidents where it's just like some

5637
02:17:28,590 --> 02:17:31,740
totally safe family man
or something and like,

5638
02:17:31,741 --> 02:17:31,951
you know,

5639
02:17:31,951 --> 02:17:33,390
an ice pillar collapses on him,

5640
02:17:33,391 --> 02:17:34,890
like say when you're
climbing or something,

5641
02:17:34,891 --> 02:17:36,540
because that happens a lot
when people are ice climbing,

5642
02:17:36,541 --> 02:17:39,290
things just collapse or whatever and you
just get hit with ice and you're done.

5643
02:17:39,291 --> 02:17:39,720
Yeah.

5644
02:17:39,720 --> 02:17:42,000
Or like rock fall or
something or like fricking,

5645
02:17:42,001 --> 02:17:43,830
I'm the head of Nols,

5646
02:17:43,831 --> 02:17:44,191
I think,

5647
02:17:44,191 --> 02:17:45,600
you know the national
outdoor leadership school,

5648
02:17:45,601 --> 02:17:46,590
like the outdoor program,

5649
02:17:47,250 --> 02:17:50,880
he was climbing some peak in Montana or
Wyoming or somewhere and tourist stuff

5650
02:17:50,881 --> 02:17:51,241
on top.

5651
02:17:51,241 --> 02:17:52,440
We're throwing rocks off the top.

5652
02:17:52,441 --> 02:17:52,711
Like,

5653
02:17:52,711 --> 02:17:52,891
oh,

5654
02:17:52,891 --> 02:17:53,724
we're on top.

5655
02:17:53,760 --> 02:17:55,410
And he got hit by a rock and died.

5656
02:17:55,520 --> 02:17:56,353
Oh,

5657
02:17:56,850 --> 02:17:57,990
you hear that kind of an accident.

5658
02:17:57,991 --> 02:17:58,441
And you were like,

5659
02:17:58,441 --> 02:17:59,280
that just sucks.

5660
02:17:59,281 --> 02:18:00,140
Because I mean,

5661
02:18:00,150 --> 02:18:01,710
you feel bad for the
dude on top of it too,

5662
02:18:01,711 --> 02:18:02,490
because you're like,

5663
02:18:02,490 --> 02:18:03,140
how could they know?

5664
02:18:03,140 --> 02:18:04,340
And the rock had poop on it.

5665
02:18:04,770 --> 02:18:04,980
Yeah,

5666
02:18:04,980 --> 02:18:05,321
exactly.

5667
02:18:05,321 --> 02:18:06,154
It's a big old rock.

5668
02:18:06,180 --> 02:18:06,681
It's really,

5669
02:18:06,681 --> 02:18:07,550
you're hurling rocks.

5670
02:18:08,230 --> 02:18:09,140
You ever thought about that?

5671
02:18:09,141 --> 02:18:09,591
Good point,

5672
02:18:09,591 --> 02:18:10,070
Brian.

5673
02:18:10,070 --> 02:18:10,780
Yeah,

5674
02:18:10,780 --> 02:18:10,940
no,

5675
02:18:10,940 --> 02:18:11,210
no,

5676
02:18:11,210 --> 02:18:11,511
no.

5677
02:18:11,511 --> 02:18:12,050
For sure.

5678
02:18:12,050 --> 02:18:12,471
And you say,

5679
02:18:12,471 --> 02:18:12,681
Hey,

5680
02:18:12,681 --> 02:18:13,514
they're down below,

5681
02:18:14,420 --> 02:18:15,260
throw my shit.

5682
02:18:15,261 --> 02:18:16,610
And it's attached to a rock.

5683
02:18:16,640 --> 02:18:17,250
Yeah.

5684
02:18:17,250 --> 02:18:17,500
Nope.

5685
02:18:17,500 --> 02:18:18,410
Everyone cool with this

5686
02:18:18,720 --> 02:18:19,940
[inaudible] report form to throw rocks.

5687
02:18:19,941 --> 02:18:20,151
I mean,

5688
02:18:20,151 --> 02:18:22,040
shit putting is actually
strongly discouraged,

5689
02:18:22,370 --> 02:18:26,000
but like generally that only happens
like early morning when you started like

5690
02:18:26,030 --> 02:18:28,040
during the night and then you
have to do and then whatever.

5691
02:18:28,041 --> 02:18:29,120
And you assume those are gonna be there.

5692
02:18:29,250 --> 02:18:31,650
Have you ever had any
weird wildlife experiences?

5693
02:18:31,680 --> 02:18:32,491
Mountain lions,

5694
02:18:32,491 --> 02:18:32,971
bears,

5695
02:18:32,971 --> 02:18:33,780
anything like that?

5696
02:18:33,780 --> 02:18:33,991
I mean,

5697
02:18:33,991 --> 02:18:34,550
I've had,

5698
02:18:34,550 --> 02:18:34,800
I mean,

5699
02:18:34,800 --> 02:18:36,820
I've had bears eat my
backpack or a couple of times,

5700
02:18:36,821 --> 02:18:37,440
so wheelie.

5701
02:18:37,440 --> 02:18:37,860
Okay.

5702
02:18:37,860 --> 02:18:38,081
Yeah,

5703
02:18:38,081 --> 02:18:40,470
I've heard photos on my phone
of a bear eating my pag though.

5704
02:18:40,720 --> 02:18:43,080
But that happens when you send me all
the time is the pair of the bears are so

5705
02:18:43,081 --> 02:18:44,670
desensitized to humans that they're like,

5706
02:18:44,671 --> 02:18:45,780
you used to interacting,

5707
02:18:46,410 --> 02:18:48,600
but there's been a few desks in Yosemite,

5708
02:18:48,800 --> 02:18:49,590
not for embarrassed.

5709
02:18:49,590 --> 02:18:49,741
Yes.

5710
02:18:49,741 --> 02:18:51,450
There has been two very,

5711
02:18:51,780 --> 02:18:52,613
very recently.

5712
02:18:52,890 --> 02:18:53,520
How recently?

5713
02:18:53,520 --> 02:18:54,353
Really recently,

5714
02:18:54,660 --> 02:18:56,130
people getting killed by a bear.

5715
02:18:56,160 --> 02:18:56,940
Yeah.

5716
02:18:56,940 --> 02:18:57,181
Yeah.

5717
02:18:57,181 --> 02:18:57,720
You sure?

5718
02:18:57,720 --> 02:18:59,820
I'm apple died from the
Honda virus this last season.

5719
02:18:59,870 --> 02:19:00,361
Absolutely.

5720
02:19:00,361 --> 02:19:01,440
100% positive.

5721
02:19:01,470 --> 02:19:03,000
Yosemite in the winter.

5722
02:19:03,240 --> 02:19:04,080
Grizzly bear.

5723
02:19:04,081 --> 02:19:04,831
Hold on there.

5724
02:19:04,831 --> 02:19:05,940
No Grizzlies in California.

5725
02:19:06,420 --> 02:19:07,820
It's a their blackberries.

5726
02:19:08,700 --> 02:19:10,170
Yosemite is not just California though,

5727
02:19:10,171 --> 02:19:11,004
right?

5728
02:19:11,180 --> 02:19:11,380
Oh,

5729
02:19:11,380 --> 02:19:12,390
you're talking about Yellowstone.

5730
02:19:12,570 --> 02:19:12,781
Oh,

5731
02:19:12,781 --> 02:19:13,520
did I say yes?

5732
02:19:13,520 --> 02:19:14,040
You'll 70.

5733
02:19:14,040 --> 02:19:14,430
Okay.

5734
02:19:14,430 --> 02:19:14,611
Yeah.

5735
02:19:14,611 --> 02:19:14,761
Okay.

5736
02:19:14,761 --> 02:19:17,580
In Yellowstone there are grizzlies and
they probably did get killed by bears

5737
02:19:18,200 --> 02:19:18,970
grizzly.

5738
02:19:18,970 --> 02:19:19,370
Yeah.

5739
02:19:19,370 --> 02:19:20,850
There's California.

5740
02:19:23,140 --> 02:19:23,750
They killed the lion.

5741
02:19:23,750 --> 02:19:25,260
All stone grizzly kills hikers.

5742
02:19:25,450 --> 02:19:25,790
Yeah.

5743
02:19:25,790 --> 02:19:26,040
Yeah.

5744
02:19:26,040 --> 02:19:26,770
To Yellowstone,

5745
02:19:26,770 --> 02:19:27,351
Yellowstone,

5746
02:19:27,351 --> 02:19:28,101
Yellowstone recently.

5747
02:19:28,101 --> 02:19:29,570
I confused the two together.

5748
02:19:29,660 --> 02:19:29,810
No,

5749
02:19:29,810 --> 02:19:30,643
that makes sense.

5750
02:19:30,760 --> 02:19:31,593
Um,

5751
02:19:31,880 --> 02:19:32,091
yeah,

5752
02:19:32,091 --> 02:19:32,780
but yellow in,

5753
02:19:32,780 --> 02:19:34,310
so they killed off all the bears.

5754
02:19:34,470 --> 02:19:35,650
They had grizzlies and

5755
02:19:37,150 --> 02:19:38,840
killed them in the state
flag of California,

5756
02:19:38,841 --> 02:19:39,081
whatever.

5757
02:19:39,081 --> 02:19:39,771
It's a grizzly bear.

5758
02:19:39,771 --> 02:19:39,971
But,

5759
02:19:39,971 --> 02:19:40,060
uh,

5760
02:19:40,060 --> 02:19:42,020
they killed the last crusade
and like 1850 or something.

5761
02:19:43,070 --> 02:19:43,903
Yeah.

5762
02:19:44,850 --> 02:19:45,900
The last California,

5763
02:19:45,901 --> 02:19:47,310
it says it here that there were,

5764
02:19:47,311 --> 02:19:48,144
there were killed.

5765
02:19:48,810 --> 02:19:49,160
That's,

5766
02:19:49,160 --> 02:19:50,100
that's fascinating.

5767
02:19:50,101 --> 02:19:50,550
Because,

5768
02:19:50,550 --> 02:19:51,120
um,

5769
02:19:51,120 --> 02:19:52,020
do any of them,

5770
02:19:52,080 --> 02:19:54,190
because they know that um,

5771
02:19:54,600 --> 02:19:58,290
polar bears travel like long distances.

5772
02:19:58,620 --> 02:20:02,610
Do grizzly bears ever tried to
come from places that they don't?

5773
02:20:03,300 --> 02:20:04,090
I don't think so.

5774
02:20:04,090 --> 02:20:04,321
I mean,

5775
02:20:04,321 --> 02:20:05,340
I mean like how far

5776
02:20:07,180 --> 02:20:09,920
is that what it would be if that is
kind of a grand place to work or us,

5777
02:20:10,310 --> 02:20:14,850
it's a lot of desert apparently there
because they know that mountain minds have

5778
02:20:14,851 --> 02:20:15,481
made that trip,

5779
02:20:15,481 --> 02:20:18,150
which is really kind of
creepy because mountain lion,

5780
02:20:18,420 --> 02:20:19,111
it's really interesting.

5781
02:20:19,111 --> 02:20:22,370
Mountain line pressure
has changed because a,

5782
02:20:22,420 --> 02:20:22,890
they don't,

5783
02:20:22,890 --> 02:20:23,723
they don't hunt them.

5784
02:20:23,850 --> 02:20:24,601
1922,

5785
02:20:24,601 --> 02:20:26,970
it was the last time a
graphs killed in California,

5786
02:20:27,090 --> 02:20:28,680
the Sierra foothills in 1922,

5787
02:20:28,850 --> 02:20:29,683
the last woman,

5788
02:20:29,910 --> 02:20:32,310
the mountain lions,

5789
02:20:32,400 --> 02:20:32,661
uh,

5790
02:20:32,661 --> 02:20:33,930
are hunted in Nevada,

5791
02:20:34,260 --> 02:20:36,030
but in California they
don't have them anymore.

5792
02:20:36,150 --> 02:20:39,330
So they've started moving in Nevada
or from Nevada into California.

5793
02:20:39,331 --> 02:20:40,320
It's really interesting.

5794
02:20:40,620 --> 02:20:43,800
It's like they've sort of figured out
that there's a hunting pressure in

5795
02:20:43,801 --> 02:20:44,240
college.

5796
02:20:44,240 --> 02:20:44,390
She,

5797
02:20:44,390 --> 02:20:45,740
I was just reading this article about,

5798
02:20:45,741 --> 02:20:46,220
uh,

5799
02:20:46,220 --> 02:20:47,240
about urban animals,

5800
02:20:47,241 --> 02:20:48,500
about like small predators,

5801
02:20:48,501 --> 02:20:49,940
like foxes and coyotes and stuff,

5802
02:20:49,941 --> 02:20:51,890
adapting to urban environments and how,

5803
02:20:52,050 --> 02:20:52,311
you know,

5804
02:20:52,311 --> 02:20:55,550
there's footage of like a coyote going
to an intersection looking both ways and

5805
02:20:55,551 --> 02:20:56,930
then crossing the road instead of these,

5806
02:20:56,931 --> 02:20:59,600
basically animals learn the
same way anybody else does.

5807
02:21:00,620 --> 02:21:01,940
It's pretty funny stuff to think about.

5808
02:21:01,941 --> 02:21:02,631
Like a little Fox,

5809
02:21:02,631 --> 02:21:02,811
you know,

5810
02:21:02,811 --> 02:21:07,040
like living in a skyscraper and
like using the streets just goes,

5811
02:21:07,490 --> 02:21:07,881
yeah,

5812
02:21:07,881 --> 02:21:08,714
it is interesting.

5813
02:21:08,810 --> 02:21:09,380
They've uh,

5814
02:21:09,380 --> 02:21:14,380
they've got a bunch of coyotes that they
have tagged that are living in Chicago.

5815
02:21:14,810 --> 02:21:15,390
And uh,

5816
02:21:15,390 --> 02:21:17,180
that was actually the example.

5817
02:21:17,240 --> 02:21:18,830
The article I was reading
was about Chicago,

5818
02:21:19,390 --> 02:21:19,721
isn't it?

5819
02:21:19,721 --> 02:21:19,940
Not?

5820
02:21:19,940 --> 02:21:20,121
I mean,

5821
02:21:20,121 --> 02:21:21,990
I think there's like
60 of them and they do,

5822
02:21:22,370 --> 02:21:25,460
they eat the rats and all that
shit and it's really weird.

5823
02:21:25,670 --> 02:21:26,960
Like they barely have track of him.

5824
02:21:27,200 --> 02:21:28,820
He's the king of like,

5825
02:21:28,821 --> 02:21:30,620
I think they have radio
bands on them and stuff.

5826
02:21:30,670 --> 02:21:30,880
Yeah.

5827
02:21:30,880 --> 02:21:31,251
All the,

5828
02:21:31,251 --> 02:21:34,340
all the berries in a Yosemite
or tagged or they were all like,

5829
02:21:34,400 --> 02:21:35,180
so when you,

5830
02:21:35,180 --> 02:21:35,481
well,

5831
02:21:35,481 --> 02:21:35,691
I mean,

5832
02:21:35,691 --> 02:21:36,860
except for a little cups and stuff.

5833
02:21:36,890 --> 02:21:37,191
But yeah,

5834
02:21:37,191 --> 02:21:38,300
they tagged the bears each season.

5835
02:21:38,600 --> 02:21:41,060
So Yosemite is California.

5836
02:21:41,061 --> 02:21:43,760
Yellow stone is part of California.

5837
02:21:43,820 --> 02:21:44,170
No,

5838
02:21:44,170 --> 02:21:46,200
no concern is Wyoming.

5839
02:21:46,201 --> 02:21:48,050
And I dunno if it's a surrounding states,

5840
02:21:48,051 --> 02:21:49,940
but it's Wyoming and that has bears.

5841
02:21:49,970 --> 02:21:51,070
They have grizzlies.

5842
02:21:51,080 --> 02:21:51,640
Yeah.

5843
02:21:51,640 --> 02:21:52,790
Do you ever go up there hiking?

5844
02:21:53,610 --> 02:21:55,220
I have as a tourist
and as a kid and stuff.

5845
02:21:55,221 --> 02:21:59,300
And the Tetons that Grand Teton
national park is also like a joining

5846
02:21:59,570 --> 02:22:00,260
Yellowstone.

5847
02:22:00,260 --> 02:22:02,510
So the Yosemite bears
at attacked your bag.

5848
02:22:02,511 --> 02:22:03,320
We're just bears.

5849
02:22:03,320 --> 02:22:03,430
Yeah,

5850
02:22:03,430 --> 02:22:03,890
they're just,

5851
02:22:03,890 --> 02:22:04,700
they're just little bike.

5852
02:22:04,700 --> 02:22:05,810
They just eat your food and stuff.

5853
02:22:05,990 --> 02:22:07,040
They don't really talk to people.

5854
02:22:07,130 --> 02:22:07,490
No,

5855
02:22:07,490 --> 02:22:09,110
I don't think anyone's ever
been attacked by a bear.

5856
02:22:09,111 --> 02:22:10,250
And he 70 really?

5857
02:22:10,280 --> 02:22:10,491
I mean,

5858
02:22:10,491 --> 02:22:11,031
they're really like,

5859
02:22:11,031 --> 02:22:11,950
they're cute little bears.

5860
02:22:11,951 --> 02:22:12,321
And I mean,

5861
02:22:12,321 --> 02:22:13,154
they're totally,

5862
02:22:13,280 --> 02:22:13,491
I mean,

5863
02:22:13,491 --> 02:22:14,324
they're cuddly looking,

5864
02:22:14,510 --> 02:22:14,931
but it's just,

5865
02:22:14,931 --> 02:22:17,450
they're around people so much that they
get used to it and then they eat your

5866
02:22:17,451 --> 02:22:18,010
shit.

5867
02:22:18,010 --> 02:22:18,843
It's kind of annoying.

5868
02:22:19,730 --> 02:22:20,001
Yeah.

5869
02:22:20,001 --> 02:22:20,990
When you see people,

5870
02:22:21,000 --> 02:22:21,770
uh,

5871
02:22:21,770 --> 02:22:23,540
feeding bears out of their car,

5872
02:22:23,570 --> 02:22:24,590
you want to punch him in the face.

5873
02:22:24,620 --> 02:22:25,080
Yeah.

5874
02:22:25,080 --> 02:22:25,441
That's,

5875
02:22:25,441 --> 02:22:25,980
that's a real

5876
02:22:25,980 --> 02:22:26,520
problem.

5877
02:22:26,520 --> 02:22:27,620
You don't see that committee,

5878
02:22:28,140 --> 02:22:28,740
but you have to,

5879
02:22:28,740 --> 02:22:29,100
uh,

5880
02:22:29,100 --> 02:22:30,510
is that Yellowstone where they do that?

5881
02:22:30,600 --> 02:22:31,433
Maybe.

5882
02:22:31,560 --> 02:22:32,750
Did you have to see that video of a,

5883
02:22:32,780 --> 02:22:33,080
there's a,

5884
02:22:33,080 --> 02:22:38,040
it's one of those faces of death videos
where a guy got out of the car to take

5885
02:22:38,041 --> 02:22:40,890
photos with a grizzling and,

5886
02:22:40,891 --> 02:22:41,340
uh,

5887
02:22:41,340 --> 02:22:41,780
truck did.

5888
02:22:41,780 --> 02:22:42,890
They were feeding the bears.

5889
02:22:42,891 --> 02:22:43,041
Do you?

5890
02:22:43,041 --> 02:22:45,060
I can choose a tourist or
something to fucking come.

5891
02:22:45,090 --> 02:22:45,930
I don't know what hearted.

5892
02:22:46,050 --> 02:22:47,010
I don't know what his deal was,

5893
02:22:47,011 --> 02:22:48,300
but there's a video of the guy,

5894
02:22:48,301 --> 02:22:48,900
he's a,

5895
02:22:48,900 --> 02:22:49,733
he hit a car.

5896
02:22:49,740 --> 02:22:50,190
Oh yeah.

5897
02:22:50,190 --> 02:22:50,310
Eh,

5898
02:22:50,310 --> 02:22:52,800
you got fucking mall in front of
everybody when they were filming it,

5899
02:22:53,320 --> 02:22:56,670
they wanted to take pictures of him out
there feeding the bearings fucked up

5900
02:22:56,671 --> 02:22:56,880
here.

5901
02:22:56,880 --> 02:22:58,410
Saw him now like bitch,

5902
02:22:59,070 --> 02:22:59,521
he has like,

5903
02:22:59,521 --> 02:23:01,990
why take the little piece of meat
when I can take the whole piece of it?

5904
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:02,640
Yeah.

5905
02:23:02,640 --> 02:23:03,510
That's pretty messed up.

5906
02:23:03,800 --> 02:23:06,600
People don't understand how
dangerous grizzlies are.

5907
02:23:06,860 --> 02:23:07,440
They,

5908
02:23:07,440 --> 02:23:09,930
they think that just because they could
be in the car and throw the stuff out

5909
02:23:09,931 --> 02:23:10,351
the window,

5910
02:23:10,351 --> 02:23:12,240
that somehow or another you
could stand outside the car.

5911
02:23:12,241 --> 02:23:13,680
Like a guy was really ballsy.

5912
02:23:14,340 --> 02:23:15,510
Thinks he could go out there and do that.

5913
02:23:15,511 --> 02:23:18,810
But that's a lot of meat
cause dangle in front of them.

5914
02:23:18,811 --> 02:23:20,040
Like you look like meat,

5915
02:23:20,100 --> 02:23:20,933
man.

5916
02:23:20,970 --> 02:23:22,650
They know like me for sure.

5917
02:23:22,950 --> 02:23:23,970
Have you seen the video?

5918
02:23:23,971 --> 02:23:24,900
Did we show that video?

5919
02:23:24,901 --> 02:23:25,860
Brian of the guy,

5920
02:23:25,900 --> 02:23:26,140
uh,

5921
02:23:26,140 --> 02:23:30,100
in Antarctica who's in
the grizzly box or the,

5922
02:23:30,110 --> 02:23:30,510
uh,

5923
02:23:30,510 --> 02:23:30,751
not,

5924
02:23:30,751 --> 02:23:30,891
uh,

5925
02:23:30,891 --> 02:23:31,760
are not Antarctica.

5926
02:23:31,820 --> 02:23:32,400
Um,

5927
02:23:32,400 --> 02:23:32,830
uh,

5928
02:23:32,830 --> 02:23:33,330
not,

5929
02:23:33,330 --> 02:23:33,600
uh,

5930
02:23:33,600 --> 02:23:34,320
he's uh,

5931
02:23:34,320 --> 02:23:39,320
he's in the Arctic and he's in a
polar bear plexiglass like box.

5932
02:23:40,630 --> 02:23:41,463
Did we show that

5933
02:23:43,160 --> 02:23:44,160
it works by bears?

5934
02:23:44,310 --> 02:23:44,551
No,

5935
02:23:44,551 --> 02:23:44,671
no,

5936
02:23:44,671 --> 02:23:44,851
no.

5937
02:23:44,851 --> 02:23:45,051
He,

5938
02:23:45,051 --> 02:23:46,440
he went up there on purpose.

5939
02:23:46,441 --> 02:23:47,160
We'll pull it up for you.

5940
02:23:47,160 --> 02:23:48,270
Just so you take a look at it.

5941
02:23:48,271 --> 02:23:49,290
Like an armored case.

5942
02:23:49,440 --> 02:23:49,681
Yeah.

5943
02:23:49,681 --> 02:23:49,891
He,

5944
02:23:49,891 --> 02:23:50,310
they,

5945
02:23:50,310 --> 02:23:50,581
they,

5946
02:23:50,581 --> 02:23:53,100
it's an upcoming documentary
that they filmed,

5947
02:23:53,340 --> 02:23:53,700
um,

5948
02:23:53,700 --> 02:23:54,091
that they,

5949
02:23:54,091 --> 02:23:56,220
they designed this piece of equipment,

5950
02:23:56,221 --> 02:23:56,490
this,

5951
02:23:56,490 --> 02:23:58,500
the structure just specifically,

5952
02:23:58,501 --> 02:24:03,140
so this guy could be dropped off there
and have these bears try to get at him

5953
02:24:03,410 --> 02:24:08,410
while he's like sitting there were these
enormous polar bear is like chewing at

5954
02:24:08,551 --> 02:24:12,120
it and sniffing it and opening
his mouth and tried to bite it.

5955
02:24:12,121 --> 02:24:16,290
It's so terrifying when you're watching
it because it seems like kind of a

5956
02:24:16,291 --> 02:24:16,680
tense,

5957
02:24:16,680 --> 02:24:16,891
oh,

5958
02:24:16,891 --> 02:24:17,730
it's so intense.

5959
02:24:17,760 --> 02:24:17,971
Well,

5960
02:24:17,971 --> 02:24:18,451
he can't,

5961
02:24:18,451 --> 02:24:19,110
they can't get in.

5962
02:24:19,110 --> 02:24:19,831
They designed it.

5963
02:24:19,831 --> 02:24:20,520
Well,

5964
02:24:20,520 --> 02:24:21,121
can I get it?

5965
02:24:21,121 --> 02:24:25,020
But there's like spots where you know
like air slots when it gets to the air

5966
02:24:25,300 --> 02:24:26,133
it's like,

5967
02:24:27,510 --> 02:24:29,850
and then it opens its mouth
and he's trying to bite it.

5968
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:30,450
Yeah,

5969
02:24:30,450 --> 02:24:31,290
it can't quite,

5970
02:24:31,291 --> 02:24:32,940
but it's so big.

5971
02:24:33,720 --> 02:24:37,170
I didn't understand for whatever
reason I knew they were big,

5972
02:24:37,470 --> 02:24:42,470
but it takes seeing it next to a
person to really conceptualize like,

5973
02:24:43,230 --> 02:24:44,063
oh,

5974
02:24:44,250 --> 02:24:45,060
oh God.

5975
02:24:45,060 --> 02:24:46,860
I mean it's like 12 feet tall.

5976
02:24:46,890 --> 02:24:48,510
It's unbelievably big.

5977
02:24:48,870 --> 02:24:52,230
And this guy's in there and this thing
has just got its arms around the box and

5978
02:24:52,231 --> 02:24:54,840
it's trying to bite it and it's trying
to figure out where the fuck it is.

5979
02:24:54,990 --> 02:24:55,823
Here it is.

5980
02:24:55,920 --> 02:25:00,900
Look at that box at this guy he's in and
he's up there just chilling around for

5981
02:25:00,901 --> 02:25:01,201
this.

5982
02:25:01,201 --> 02:25:01,650
Uh,

5983
02:25:01,650 --> 02:25:02,580
what is the BBC?

5984
02:25:02,581 --> 02:25:02,871
I'll,

5985
02:25:02,871 --> 02:25:05,650
I'll give it a plug so that
people know what's Debbie's.

5986
02:25:06,320 --> 02:25:06,501
Yeah,

5987
02:25:06,501 --> 02:25:07,920
it's a BBC documentary.

5988
02:25:07,950 --> 02:25:08,910
A polar bear

5989
02:25:10,620 --> 02:25:12,330
from Gordon boot.

5990
02:25:12,331 --> 02:25:14,190
Cannon Gordon Be Kannon.

5991
02:25:14,191 --> 02:25:14,730
Do they,

5992
02:25:14,730 --> 02:25:16,290
what is the name of the show?

5993
02:25:16,291 --> 02:25:17,820
It's a nature documentary.

5994
02:25:18,930 --> 02:25:19,763
Yeah.

5995
02:25:20,610 --> 02:25:21,870
Oh my God.

5996
02:25:24,280 --> 02:25:24,590
Hey.

5997
02:25:24,590 --> 02:25:25,423
There

5998
02:25:28,850 --> 02:25:31,770
is thousands of times
more powerful than mine.

5999
02:25:32,430 --> 02:25:36,990
It's gathering information before they
approaches like it would when stoking a

6000
02:25:36,991 --> 02:25:37,824
seal.

6001
02:25:38,400 --> 02:25:41,100
My sand is strongest at the weakest point,

6002
02:25:41,610 --> 02:25:42,443
the door

6003
02:25:50,030 --> 02:25:50,863
fragile,

6004
02:25:51,620 --> 02:25:55,610
that door open systematically
trying from all angles.

6005
02:25:55,611 --> 02:25:56,444
Look at the size of

6006
02:25:57,970 --> 02:25:59,970
that appreciation for what this animal is.

6007
02:26:01,400 --> 02:26:04,130
One of the most powerful
animals on the planet.

6008
02:26:05,090 --> 02:26:07,040
Almost intimidating animals on the planet.

6009
02:26:08,210 --> 02:26:11,060
One of the few animals that
actually see us as food.

6010
02:26:13,170 --> 02:26:14,350
Wonder how that guy got signed

6011
02:26:16,090 --> 02:26:17,020
to a gap.

6012
02:26:18,600 --> 02:26:21,600
You can sniff my nose

6013
02:26:39,500 --> 02:26:41,090
if you haven't seen this video,

6014
02:26:41,091 --> 02:26:41,924
folks.

6015
02:26:41,930 --> 02:26:44,720
You've got to go online and just watch it.

6016
02:26:44,721 --> 02:26:45,740
This is just a clip.

6017
02:26:46,210 --> 02:26:47,090
The video,

6018
02:26:47,091 --> 02:26:47,340
uh,

6019
02:26:47,340 --> 02:26:47,631
uh,

6020
02:26:47,631 --> 02:26:48,051
is,

6021
02:26:48,051 --> 02:26:48,770
uh,

6022
02:26:48,770 --> 02:26:49,570
I believe in.

6023
02:26:49,570 --> 02:26:50,403
There's a,

6024
02:26:50,460 --> 02:26:50,971
okay there.

6025
02:26:50,971 --> 02:26:51,381
It already,

6026
02:26:51,381 --> 02:26:55,790
it's called the polar bear family
and me and it aired a Monday,

6027
02:26:55,791 --> 02:26:58,340
January 7th on BBC two.

6028
02:26:58,341 --> 02:26:58,821
But you can,

6029
02:26:58,821 --> 02:27:03,470
you can find it online and you got to
see it just to see how fucking I same

6030
02:27:03,950 --> 02:27:04,340
breastfed.

6031
02:27:04,340 --> 02:27:04,990
I'm totally vain.

6032
02:27:04,990 --> 02:27:05,540
Gross.

6033
02:27:05,540 --> 02:27:06,380
It was amazing.

6034
02:27:06,440 --> 02:27:06,591
Well,

6035
02:27:06,591 --> 02:27:09,200
I would imagine that a guy like
you that's so into thrills,

6036
02:27:09,201 --> 02:27:10,180
like that would be a,

6037
02:27:10,730 --> 02:27:10,881
well,

6038
02:27:10,881 --> 02:27:12,290
I'm not going to get eaten by bears.

6039
02:27:12,350 --> 02:27:12,930
Mean.

6040
02:27:12,930 --> 02:27:14,150
I'm not saying that you
would want to do it,

6041
02:27:14,151 --> 02:27:15,680
but I though it'd be fascinating to you.

6042
02:27:16,100 --> 02:27:16,910
Yeah,

6043
02:27:16,910 --> 02:27:17,750
that's pretty hardcore.

6044
02:27:18,110 --> 02:27:18,351
Yeah.

6045
02:27:18,351 --> 02:27:19,310
If you ever had a trunk climb,

6046
02:27:19,311 --> 02:27:20,390
anything ice,

6047
02:27:20,391 --> 02:27:22,850
anything like Sharon when I
was coming for the first time,

6048
02:27:22,851 --> 02:27:23,990
like last week in Salt Lake.

6049
02:27:24,260 --> 02:27:25,093
Oh really?

6050
02:27:25,340 --> 02:27:25,881
Which a climb,

6051
02:27:25,881 --> 02:27:27,350
like a waterfall is or
something like that.

6052
02:27:27,351 --> 02:27:27,981
Is that what it's called?

6053
02:27:27,981 --> 02:27:28,814
Ice Climbing?

6054
02:27:28,880 --> 02:27:29,270
Yeah.

6055
02:27:29,270 --> 02:27:29,451
Yeah.

6056
02:27:29,451 --> 02:27:33,410
Basically it's like a watercourse
and like ice builds up and yeah,

6057
02:27:34,100 --> 02:27:35,930
so like what we did was called
the great white ice cold,

6058
02:27:35,931 --> 02:27:36,920
but it's kind of like a,

6059
02:27:37,250 --> 02:27:41,330
it's almost like a steep sort of wall
slash gully that like forms up with a lot

6060
02:27:41,331 --> 02:27:42,290
of steps ice.

6061
02:27:42,310 --> 02:27:45,080
So you like climb a little cliff advice
and then you go up like a steep snow

6062
02:27:45,081 --> 02:27:46,340
slope and then another ice cliff,

6063
02:27:46,590 --> 02:27:47,100
whatever.

6064
02:27:47,100 --> 02:27:48,500
Is that real unpredictable?

6065
02:27:49,570 --> 02:27:50,060
Yeah.

6066
02:27:50,060 --> 02:27:50,331
Yeah,

6067
02:27:50,331 --> 02:27:51,164
it can be.

6068
02:27:51,260 --> 02:27:52,550
I would think that there's a lot of,

6069
02:27:52,570 --> 02:27:52,731
sure.

6070
02:27:52,731 --> 02:27:54,290
It's much less predictable than rock,

6071
02:27:54,580 --> 02:27:54,831
you know,

6072
02:27:54,831 --> 02:27:59,831
because it's constantly like changing
temperature and you just fall off for

6073
02:28:00,041 --> 02:28:00,440
sure.

6074
02:28:00,440 --> 02:28:01,273
For sure.

6075
02:28:01,450 --> 02:28:03,560
That's part of the reason
I've never been that into it.

6076
02:28:03,620 --> 02:28:04,460
I think it's kind of sketch.

6077
02:28:04,460 --> 02:28:06,140
So you just sketchy.

6078
02:28:06,380 --> 02:28:09,110
So you just did it a
as a just like fuck it,

6079
02:28:09,111 --> 02:28:10,040
let me just do this.

6080
02:28:10,610 --> 02:28:11,930
Well just to learn how it basically,

6081
02:28:12,170 --> 02:28:13,003
um,

6082
02:28:13,490 --> 02:28:16,060
cause I'm pretty sure I might be doing
some trips to like Alaska or something

6083
02:28:16,080 --> 02:28:16,913
this year and um,

6084
02:28:17,290 --> 02:28:19,070
the could climb bigger granite rock faces.

6085
02:28:19,130 --> 02:28:20,570
But the thing is when you
go to places like that,

6086
02:28:20,571 --> 02:28:22,220
I mean it's common like
a big granite wall,

6087
02:28:22,221 --> 02:28:23,060
which is what I normally do.

6088
02:28:23,061 --> 02:28:26,330
But then on top there'll be like some
sections of ice or whatever and you have

6089
02:28:26,331 --> 02:28:29,030
to at least be comfortable like hiking
in your crampons and things like that.

6090
02:28:29,600 --> 02:28:30,021
So I was like,

6091
02:28:30,021 --> 02:28:30,171
well,

6092
02:28:30,171 --> 02:28:31,820
I've got to at least learn
how to use all this gear,

6093
02:28:31,821 --> 02:28:32,510
you know.

6094
02:28:32,510 --> 02:28:33,530
So I went out and practiced.

6095
02:28:34,190 --> 02:28:35,540
Do you have any desire to do Everest?

6096
02:28:36,230 --> 02:28:36,560
I Dunno.

6097
02:28:36,560 --> 02:28:37,910
I mean if somebody would pay for the trip,

6098
02:28:37,911 --> 02:28:39,980
I probably would just feel
like the life experience.

6099
02:28:40,520 --> 02:28:42,860
But it's definitely not
like a climbing thing.

6100
02:28:43,010 --> 02:28:45,950
Actually somebody posted some rant that
you had maybe from standup comedy or

6101
02:28:45,951 --> 02:28:48,290
something about making fun
of people on mountains,

6102
02:28:48,590 --> 02:28:49,131
which I was like,

6103
02:28:49,131 --> 02:28:49,330
you know,

6104
02:28:49,330 --> 02:28:50,150
Everest one.

6105
02:28:50,150 --> 02:28:50,541
Yeah,

6106
02:28:50,541 --> 02:28:51,374
totally.

6107
02:28:51,520 --> 02:28:53,770
But it was material.

6108
02:28:53,800 --> 02:28:54,290
I mean,

6109
02:28:54,290 --> 02:28:57,140
well the thing is climate isn't in front
of that stuff too because like what

6110
02:28:57,141 --> 02:29:00,560
people do on Everest is so far removed
from actual climbing that it's like,

6111
02:29:00,950 --> 02:29:01,340
you know,

6112
02:29:01,340 --> 02:29:02,550
they don't anymore really?

6113
02:29:03,200 --> 02:29:03,381
Well,

6114
02:29:03,381 --> 02:29:03,591
yeah.

6115
02:29:03,591 --> 02:29:03,891
It's like,

6116
02:29:03,891 --> 02:29:04,041
yeah,

6117
02:29:04,041 --> 02:29:04,521
it's a hike,

6118
02:29:04,521 --> 02:29:06,890
but I don't know if it was
your ranch or another one.

6119
02:29:07,040 --> 02:29:07,641
But I mean,

6120
02:29:07,641 --> 02:29:10,310
you're basically hiring Sherpas to
do all the actual climbing for you.

6121
02:29:10,340 --> 02:29:11,180
And then you know,

6122
02:29:11,181 --> 02:29:13,340
if you're like a
conventional western client,

6123
02:29:13,341 --> 02:29:13,850
whatever,

6124
02:29:13,850 --> 02:29:14,120
you know,

6125
02:29:14,120 --> 02:29:14,331
I mean,

6126
02:29:14,331 --> 02:29:15,830
you're basically being
shuttled up a mountain.

6127
02:29:16,110 --> 02:29:16,943
I was like,

6128
02:29:17,150 --> 02:29:17,983
I don't know.

6129
02:29:18,610 --> 02:29:19,443
Yeah.

6130
02:29:20,190 --> 02:29:21,120
Who actually had it.

6131
02:29:21,121 --> 02:29:25,280
So I climbed Kilimanjaro like that
with my girlfriend and what my then

6132
02:29:25,281 --> 02:29:29,600
girlfriend and September and I'm just
as kind of like a tourist vacation,

6133
02:29:29,601 --> 02:29:29,841
you know,

6134
02:29:29,841 --> 02:29:30,151
like Oh,

6135
02:29:30,151 --> 02:29:30,984
it'll be fun.

6136
02:29:31,280 --> 02:29:34,190
And it was my first experience with people
like carrying all your stuff for you

6137
02:29:34,191 --> 02:29:36,110
in setting up for 10 for
you and doing all the work.

6138
02:29:36,111 --> 02:29:36,531
And I was like,

6139
02:29:36,531 --> 02:29:36,801
dude,

6140
02:29:36,801 --> 02:29:37,610
this is a pretty,

6141
02:29:37,610 --> 02:29:38,720
it's pretty friggin buddy.

6142
02:29:38,980 --> 02:29:39,221
I mean,

6143
02:29:39,221 --> 02:29:39,981
I felt weird about it,

6144
02:29:39,981 --> 02:29:40,580
but like,

6145
02:29:40,580 --> 02:29:41,720
I mean it is a vacation.

6146
02:29:41,721 --> 02:29:43,250
I can see why people would do that for,

6147
02:29:43,700 --> 02:29:43,941
you know,

6148
02:29:43,941 --> 02:29:44,810
to feel extreme.

6149
02:29:44,811 --> 02:29:45,231
Cause you're like,

6150
02:29:45,231 --> 02:29:47,000
oh I climbed the biggest
mountain in Africa,

6151
02:29:47,030 --> 02:29:50,810
but it was like a dude brewing
the tea every day in that format,

6152
02:29:51,210 --> 02:29:51,421
you know?

6153
02:29:51,421 --> 02:29:51,830
But,

6154
02:29:51,830 --> 02:29:53,510
but as far as like going
somewhere with a girlfriend,

6155
02:29:53,511 --> 02:29:53,691
you know,

6156
02:29:53,691 --> 02:29:53,931
I was like,

6157
02:29:53,931 --> 02:29:54,021
oh,

6158
02:29:54,021 --> 02:29:56,780
it's a pretty legit vacation is cool
and we get to see more of Africa.

6159
02:29:56,781 --> 02:29:57,110
You know?

6160
02:29:57,110 --> 02:29:58,640
That's like full service camping.

6161
02:29:58,730 --> 02:29:59,031
Yeah,

6162
02:29:59,031 --> 02:29:59,864
no it was,

6163
02:29:59,900 --> 02:30:00,733
it was like,

6164
02:30:00,920 --> 02:30:01,311
I was like,

6165
02:30:01,311 --> 02:30:01,461
dude,

6166
02:30:01,461 --> 02:30:03,650
this is as good as I
live at home or better,

6167
02:30:03,651 --> 02:30:04,484
you know,

6168
02:30:04,540 --> 02:30:04,810
like this.

6169
02:30:04,810 --> 02:30:05,541
It's pretty legit,

6170
02:30:05,541 --> 02:30:06,374
you know?

6171
02:30:06,980 --> 02:30:08,060
That's fascinating man.

6172
02:30:08,120 --> 02:30:08,630
Listen man,

6173
02:30:08,630 --> 02:30:08,891
dude,

6174
02:30:08,891 --> 02:30:09,000
you,

6175
02:30:09,000 --> 02:30:10,160
you live an amazing life.

6176
02:30:10,190 --> 02:30:11,030
It's really awesome.

6177
02:30:11,090 --> 02:30:14,570
And I really appreciate you taking the
time to come in here and sit down and

6178
02:30:14,571 --> 02:30:15,260
shoot the shit with us.

6179
02:30:15,260 --> 02:30:18,230
It was fascinating and intriguing and,

6180
02:30:18,280 --> 02:30:18,570
uh,

6181
02:30:18,570 --> 02:30:19,190
and,

6182
02:30:19,190 --> 02:30:21,830

to you and the stay healthy.

6183
02:30:21,831 --> 02:30:24,200
And I would love to have you
come back here and do the scan,

6184
02:30:24,201 --> 02:30:24,530
man.

6185
02:30:24,530 --> 02:30:25,363
I'm sure people,

6186
02:30:25,580 --> 02:30:26,310
thanks for the love you.

6187
02:30:26,310 --> 02:30:27,260
We'd love to hear your stories.

6188
02:30:27,261 --> 02:30:29,240
And if you want to do
that thing with Brian,

6189
02:30:29,300 --> 02:30:30,320
he's down this weekend.

6190
02:30:30,321 --> 02:30:31,154
Are you gonna come to the UFC?

6191
02:30:31,190 --> 02:30:31,730
Is that all?

6192
02:30:31,730 --> 02:30:33,430
Maybe I'll ask you about it on.

6193
02:30:33,820 --> 02:30:34,070
Well,

6194
02:30:34,070 --> 02:30:34,371
I mean,

6195
02:30:34,371 --> 02:30:34,670
you know,

6196
02:30:34,670 --> 02:30:35,860
this is a rare opportunity.

6197
02:30:35,861 --> 02:30:38,490
This doesn't happen that often where
you're going to be in the same thing.

6198
02:30:38,520 --> 02:30:39,430
I might actually,

6199
02:30:39,770 --> 02:30:40,570
we're going to have to do it.

6200
02:30:40,570 --> 02:30:41,403
We'll talk.

6201
02:30:42,230 --> 02:30:42,861
Thank you very much.

6202
02:30:42,861 --> 02:30:43,491
Really appreciate it.
