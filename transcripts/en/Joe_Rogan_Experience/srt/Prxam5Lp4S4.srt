1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,500
The call,
is that okay?

2
00:00:01,501 --> 00:00:02,760
Is that comfortable?
Yeah.

3
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:03,703
Okay.

4
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:05,860
Okay.

5
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:10,560
That's where there's a constant debate
as to whether or not the headphones on

6
00:00:10,561 --> 00:00:15,561
the way to go because the headphones or
the only way that you can hear exactly

7
00:00:15,901 --> 00:00:18,540
what other people are going to hear when
they listen to the podcast so you can

8
00:00:18,541 --> 00:00:23,541
kind of review it while it's happening.
Like if only I wear headphones than it

9
00:00:23,551 --> 00:00:25,650
feels weird like I'm interviewing.
Yeah.

10
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,110
Yeah.
And it seems kind of to focus my

11
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:29,980
attention just on the.
Yeah,

12
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:31,950
yeah,
yeah.

13
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:32,933
Come back,
man.

14
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:36,360
Good to see Dublin from maps.
That's for whatever reason,

15
00:00:36,361 --> 00:00:41,340
that acronym.
I always stumble with Multidisciplinary

16
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:42,173
Association for Psychedelic Studies.
Yes.

17
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:45,630
Yeah,
and actually I was just yesterday with

18
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:50,250
and today with Ralph Metzner and I got
the name from him in a way.

19
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:54,900
He wrote a book,
maps of consciousness and I needed a

20
00:00:54,901 --> 00:00:58,650
name for the organization that had a p
in it for a psychedelic and so I was

21
00:00:58,651 --> 00:01:03,000
looking around for words that had a p in
it and maps and I really liked what

22
00:01:03,001 --> 00:01:06,270
Ralph did and with Tim and robbed us and
the rest and say,

23
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:07,560
I thought maps.

24
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,890
It helps
explain a territory.

25
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:14,490
Yeah,
well you guys are so important when it

26
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:19,491
comes to the dialogue of psychedelics
because from an outsider,

27
00:01:19,741 --> 00:01:22,470
this is how I always viewed maps.
Maps is always like,

28
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,570
oh,
those are the actual really smart dudes

29
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:28,760
during the psychedelics because there's
someone who wacky fuckers out there in

30
00:01:28,761 --> 00:01:32,370
the world of psychedelics and they want
to bring you crystals and talk to you

31
00:01:32,371 --> 00:01:36,930
about channeling and I know a healer and
there's so much going on.

32
00:01:36,931 --> 00:01:40,650
That's so crazy.
And then there was science and then

33
00:01:40,651 --> 00:01:43,450
there was people doing actual peer
reviewed studies.

34
00:01:43,451 --> 00:01:47,820
There's actual scientists involved.
There was real data and you guys were

35
00:01:47,821 --> 00:01:49,650
pursuing it the right way and I was
like,

36
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,080
oh,
these guys are so important because

37
00:01:52,081 --> 00:01:55,200
there's not a lot of people that.
That's one of the weird things about

38
00:01:55,201 --> 00:01:57,660
psychedelics.
You could tell people that you went out

39
00:01:57,661 --> 00:02:00,870
and drank whiskey until your feet went
numb and you shit your pants and no one

40
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:03,720
cares,
but if you tell people that you got

41
00:02:03,721 --> 00:02:07,740
together with some friends and you took
a naturally occurring psychedelic drug

42
00:02:07,741 --> 00:02:11,400
and you explored your consciousness and
you're so much happier now and you feel

43
00:02:11,401 --> 00:02:14,730
better about life and you're more
optimistic if you do that,

44
00:02:14,731 --> 00:02:18,840
you're some fucking wacky hippy Druggie,
some loser.

45
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:23,460
Well that's the perception and so we've
got this coming out and we've looked at

46
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:27,330
other social change movements like gay
marriage and gay rights and it comes

47
00:02:27,331 --> 00:02:30,900
from people coming out because there are
loads of smart people that do

48
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:35,901
psychedelics or talented or emotionally
wise and they just keep it quiet so

49
00:02:36,961 --> 00:02:41,310
people don't really know who in society
has had these influences and they don't

50
00:02:41,311 --> 00:02:42,720
have to keep it quiet.
Either.

51
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:48,260
It's jobs think that their employees for
some reason would be better off if they

52
00:02:49,411 --> 00:02:51,360
didn't do certain drugs,
certain jobs.

53
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:54,330
I think that's crazy.
The idea that they get to control your

54
00:02:54,331 --> 00:02:56,760
body when you're not there is just
crazy.

55
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,680
Yeah.
But if you look at the companies like

56
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,490
facebook and Google

57
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:04,480
and all these tech companies,
they don't do drug tests.

58
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:05,290
They're better.
Nah,

59
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:06,610
they don't lose everybody.
Yeah.

60
00:03:06,611 --> 00:03:11,611
They know the pot test.
Oh good Lord.

61
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,020
Oh my God.
They would lose.

62
00:03:14,021 --> 00:03:18,700
The entire company would come back with
a real straight laced republican trump

63
00:03:18,701 --> 00:03:20,250
supporting.
Yeah.

64
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,000
Yeah.
So the,

65
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,850
the innovation and psychedelics and
marijuana and looking at things in

66
00:03:24,851 --> 00:03:27,700
different ways.
People are getting to appreciate that.

67
00:03:27,701 --> 00:03:31,840
I think more the culture is changing
while we're in these camps.

68
00:03:31,841 --> 00:03:32,950
You know,
we have these camps,

69
00:03:32,951 --> 00:03:34,810
the do's and the don'ts.
Do you take drugs,

70
00:03:34,811 --> 00:03:37,870
do not take drugs and you know,
and there's a lot of people that pride

71
00:03:37,871 --> 00:03:41,800
themselves on one or the other,
whether they're a perturber or non

72
00:03:41,801 --> 00:03:43,630
perturbed,
you know there's,

73
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:47,770
there's people that get weird about
people that are doing things other than

74
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:49,630
what they're doing.
They don't like it.

75
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:51,940
Yeah.
And that's why we need this kind of

76
00:03:51,941 --> 00:03:52,640
coming out.

77
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,310
Yeah.
So we were having these global

78
00:03:54,311 --> 00:03:57,550
psychedelic dinners,
and this is our 30th anniversary

79
00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:02,020
actually,
tomorrow is the 30th year that I started

80
00:04:02,021 --> 00:04:07,021
maps in 1986 and we're asking people to,
um,

81
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:12,310
in their own homes or with their friends
to invite people over and then have them

82
00:04:12,311 --> 00:04:16,630
tell stories of what psychedelics have
meant to them or what their hopes are

83
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:19,120
for psychedelic research.
So you're inviting everyone to do it,

84
00:04:19,121 --> 00:04:21,010
like on a,
like to make a night of it.

85
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,200
Yeah.
And it's like a Holiday Inn.

86
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:24,093
Yes.
Yeah.

87
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,320
During April,
during the month of April.

88
00:04:26,321 --> 00:04:28,450
Generally you're creating your own
holiday.

89
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:29,291
It's,
well,

90
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:31,180
there's people that have done this
before.

91
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:33,280
There's,
with conversations about death with

92
00:04:33,281 --> 00:04:38,281
dinner and drugs with dinner event.
So they try to promote conversations in

93
00:04:40,031 --> 00:04:43,900
safe places,
but where people feel comfortable to

94
00:04:43,901 --> 00:04:46,210
really be more honest and they can open
up.

95
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:52,050
And so it's kind of modeling on that and
then it hopefully helps people to come

96
00:04:52,271 --> 00:04:53,410
out even more.

97
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,300
I mean,
we even have like a twitter,

98
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:56,400
uh,
um,

99
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:01,640
it's a Hashtag psychedelics because so
people can write in and just say

100
00:05:02,141 --> 00:05:04,600
psychedelics matter to me because,
or you know,

101
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:05,350
I,
I'm,

102
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:07,820
I am more hopeful or I'm,
you know,

103
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,100
feeling that multigenerational trauma
can be addressed through.

104
00:05:12,101 --> 00:05:15,580
Isn't that incredible that,
that is one of the best things for it.

105
00:05:15,581 --> 00:05:20,581
Is Mtma one of the best things as far as
getting over traumatic experiences is an

106
00:05:20,831 --> 00:05:22,660
illegal drug.
Yeah.

107
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,100
And yet there's a carved out area that
we've been able to make legal which is

108
00:05:27,101 --> 00:05:31,630
the research area and it's because
science is the vehicle in our culture

109
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:35,440
that we trust more religion than our
religions.

110
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:40,840
And so it felt like science and healing
where the ways into the culture that was

111
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:45,870
freaked out by psychedelics in the
sixties and now because of these crises

112
00:05:47,021 --> 00:05:50,980
we're in and also these tools that can
be shown to be really helpful and that

113
00:05:50,981 --> 00:05:55,150
people have made life's out of them,
that it's not hurt them.

114
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:57,530
It's helped them,
but people don't it.

115
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:02,590
So that's where we think the research is
helping people create a space where they

116
00:06:03,441 --> 00:06:04,274
can talk about it.

117
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:06,960
Well,
I think it's people are starting to

118
00:06:06,961 --> 00:06:11,490
understand the true nature of these
things instead of the propaganda.

119
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:15,870
Then they're doing it from people like
yourself being really honest about their

120
00:06:15,871 --> 00:06:19,260
experiences and people like yourself.
Even more importantly,

121
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:20,580
[inaudible].
There's not a lot of people like you

122
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:25,680
that have actually gone out and pursued
all of the significant scientific data

123
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:29,490
on psychedelics and the beneficial
properties to it so that we can

124
00:06:29,491 --> 00:06:32,370
understand like we have this idea about
a thing.

125
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:34,380
Forget it.
Put all your ideologies.

126
00:06:34,381 --> 00:06:36,690
Decide whether you're a right wing or
left wing.

127
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:41,670
We have an idea about a thing that's not
correct and this idea about a thing is

128
00:06:41,671 --> 00:06:46,671
that there's a certain group of
consciousness adjusting substances that

129
00:06:46,801 --> 00:06:50,700
are for losers.
They're for dumb people there for fools

130
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:54,900
and don't you mess with those and
everybody who does those is lazy and

131
00:06:54,901 --> 00:06:59,180
Stinky and wet and you'll lock there
like people.

132
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:02,340
There's a lot of people that
automatically lock into that pattern of

133
00:07:02,341 --> 00:07:05,640
thinking.
That's their go to for for any drugs.

134
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:09,420
Anything that's not legal,
but yet those same people oftentimes

135
00:07:09,421 --> 00:07:12,060
will drink.
They have no problem doing that,

136
00:07:12,061 --> 00:07:14,420
and they allowed times they'll take
pills to which,

137
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:16,890
which is even more bananas.
Yeah.

138
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:20,570
There was this idea that drugs are
marijuana hurts.

139
00:07:20,571 --> 00:07:25,571
Your Iq says there has been to prove it.
Is that true?

140
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,380
Well,
the arrows,

141
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:30,710
a study,
the national institutes of health just

142
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:34,850
two weeks ago had a conference in
Washington at the NIH headquarters.

143
00:07:34,851 --> 00:07:38,120
The head of Nih was there,
the head of night at the head of Nih,

144
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:41,090
national institute mental health about
marijuana and cannabinoids,

145
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:45,950
and it was a neuroscience review and
they presented results that suggested

146
00:07:45,951 --> 00:07:50,951
that there was a heavy marijuana smokers
that started early in their lives over,

147
00:07:53,001 --> 00:07:55,340
um,
this was done in New Zealand over like a

148
00:07:55,341 --> 00:07:59,030
20 year period.
Had some differences.

149
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:00,610
Lower Iq than there

150
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:02,100
control groups.
Well,

151
00:08:02,101 --> 00:08:05,580
if you're talking about people that are
smoking marijuana heavily,

152
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:09,150
one of the things that I would say is
that if you're smoking marijuana

153
00:08:09,151 --> 00:08:11,070
heavily,
you're not going to do a whole lot of

154
00:08:11,071 --> 00:08:13,890
thinking.
You're going to zone the fuck out.

155
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:17,580
You're going to do a lot of zone.
And out and while sober people might be

156
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:22,260
absorbing more information,
you're probably often worldly Iran all

157
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:24,090
day long.
That's not necessarily healthy.

158
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:27,360
I think all psychedelic drugs.
C should be an enhancer,

159
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:30,300
but they shouldn't be in replace of
like,

160
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:32,010
you shouldn't say,
you know,

161
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:35,430
I'm just going to be high from the
moment I wake up to the moment I go to

162
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:37,500
sleep every single day and this is how I
exist.

163
00:08:37,501 --> 00:08:38,950
I'm just high all the time.
Hi.

164
00:08:38,951 --> 00:08:39,530
Hi.
Hi.

165
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:41,160
Hi.
Take a break,

166
00:08:41,161 --> 00:08:42,180
man.
Yeah,

167
00:08:42,181 --> 00:08:43,140
I had that

168
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:48,430
sense of as in my early twenties,
so smoking all the time to be high,

169
00:08:48,431 --> 00:08:49,090
high,
high.

170
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:52,600
And I enjoyed it and I felt that got me
into things that got me really into

171
00:08:52,601 --> 00:08:54,610
physical work and labor.
Really?

172
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:56,540
Yeah.
Fun and exercise.

173
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:59,340
Fantastic.
I mean that's the opposite of the couch

174
00:08:59,341 --> 00:09:00,540
potato idea,
you know,

175
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:02,910
that people have.
But pod and exercise.

176
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:06,140
I'm just men.
I ran the New York marathon.

177
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,930
Willow stones.
That's amazing.

178
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:10,350
That's amazing.
Tired in the middle.

179
00:09:10,351 --> 00:09:15,351
And I walked into a Porta potty and
smoke some.

180
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:21,720
We jump back in.
Oh my God,

181
00:09:21,721 --> 00:09:26,310
that's a great story.
Delirious lot of Jujitsu people smoked

182
00:09:26,311 --> 00:09:28,770
pot for Jujitsu.
It's a big one.

183
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,700
Snowboarders.
Snowboarders.

184
00:09:32,701 --> 00:09:33,710
Love it.
Yeah.

185
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,550
Snowboarders.
They say basketball players.

186
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:36,600
Yeah.
They say that.

187
00:09:36,601 --> 00:09:39,870
It's one of the things about the NBA,
it's like you better not be testing for

188
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:43,350
weed because these dudes it when it
would make sense too,

189
00:09:43,351 --> 00:09:46,560
because I don't play basketball,
but I play pool and it's,

190
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:47,370
it's,
um,

191
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:51,630
one similarity that they share is that
it's about touch and feel and touch and

192
00:09:51,631 --> 00:09:54,720
feel is way enhanced.
A lot of the best pool player is also

193
00:09:54,721 --> 00:09:55,554
smoked pot.

194
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:57,151
You know,
this guy,

195
00:09:57,151 --> 00:10:02,151
a full blown up his spot to spot.
This is a video of me doing an

196
00:10:03,451 --> 00:10:05,460
impression of him and he's like a
genius.

197
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:07,950
Fuck fucker.
They'll say it seems earl strickland,

198
00:10:07,951 --> 00:10:11,970
he's a genius pool player and I,
he might have occasionally enjoyed

199
00:10:11,971 --> 00:10:13,260
marijuana.
That's all I'm saying.

200
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:15,240
But um,
these guys,

201
00:10:15,241 --> 00:10:16,470
like they say that,
um,

202
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:19,230
when,
when they're smoking pot and playing,

203
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:23,310
you can see things better.
You have a better sense of where the

204
00:10:23,311 --> 00:10:26,040
ball's going.
You have more sensitivity as far as how

205
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:27,810
far it rolls.
Yeah.

206
00:10:27,811 --> 00:10:32,811
I used to play racquetball a lot in
handball and a lot and sometimes I would

207
00:10:33,871 --> 00:10:36,690
play stoned and sometimes I,
when I was,

208
00:10:36,691 --> 00:10:40,050
she did have that deeper sense of being
in the moment.

209
00:10:40,051 --> 00:10:43,500
You were just one step,
instant more into the moment as and

210
00:10:43,501 --> 00:10:46,800
predicting and knowing and just um,
but I could never,

211
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:51,930
there was an unpredictability about it
so I could never really tell if I would

212
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,790
play better or worse.

213
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:59,310
That's probably why you play good
because you're never sure and you just

214
00:10:59,311 --> 00:11:01,770
stayed on the edge.
You know,

215
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,210
there's a thing,
there's an ego dissolve in quality of

216
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:10,410
any of these psychoactive substances and
I think that ego dissolve in quality

217
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:15,300
gives you more space to move around with
all your other focuses.

218
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:17,940
That's my theory about it because I
always felt like,

219
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:22,270
like with Jujitsu,
you definitely feel better at Jujitsu

220
00:11:22,271 --> 00:11:24,240
when you're high.
And I was trying to figure out why.

221
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:28,260
Well,
you also feel like you somehow or

222
00:11:28,261 --> 00:11:32,250
another you feel more more vulnerable
yet you do better.

223
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:36,240
Like you're more like,
like kind of freaked out by any

224
00:11:36,241 --> 00:11:40,800
aggression or more trying to avoid any
sort of conflict.

225
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:45,810
That's what the driving studies of
marijuana and drivers show that people

226
00:11:45,811 --> 00:11:49,230
know that they're slightly impaired and
they take defensive measures and they

227
00:11:49,231 --> 00:11:54,040
drive slower and more aware of the
possibilities of error as well.

228
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:54,851
Yeah.
Yeah.

229
00:11:54,851 --> 00:11:57,910
And you're correcting for it and you
drive more carefully.

230
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:03,550
I think that's the part that
we have to really be the experts on the

231
00:12:06,191 --> 00:12:08,310
risks as well as the benefits.
Yeah,

232
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:10,210
definitely.
That we can't ignore that.

233
00:12:10,211 --> 00:12:13,450
There are both sides of it for sure.
With edibles,

234
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:20,080
edibles and driving settled down to
police settle down.

235
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:22,510
Are you sure?
You sure that's a good idea.

236
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,580
Yeah.
Although I think the idea we need to do

237
00:12:27,581 --> 00:12:31,690
is more move to performance tests rather
than drug tests and then that's really

238
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:35,200
directly what you're concerned about and
then you need people's behaviors to

239
00:12:35,201 --> 00:12:38,680
themselves,
but you checked their real performance,

240
00:12:38,681 --> 00:12:41,470
not these indicators or predictors.
Yep.

241
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:46,060
From my personal experience,
there's a big difference between how you

242
00:12:46,061 --> 00:12:51,061
understand and operate under it as like
someone who's been smoking pot for like

243
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:57,120
15 years versus someone who's been
smoking pot for like a week or a month

244
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:59,200
or even a year.

245
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:03,280
Like there's a difference in sometimes
your ability to handle being really high

246
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,460
like you,
your anxiety takes hold of you because

247
00:13:06,461 --> 00:13:07,600
you're like,
oh my God,

248
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:10,270
and you start freaking out.
Then you can't drive,

249
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:12,340
you can't do anything.
And then there's people who that are

250
00:13:12,341 --> 00:13:14,140
just,
oh Geez,

251
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:17,860
like that action Bronson Character
Action Bronson came in here.

252
00:13:17,861 --> 00:13:21,510
This motherfucker smoked like nine
joints in the entire time he was here.

253
00:13:21,511 --> 00:13:23,980
He just kept smoking and I had to tap
out.

254
00:13:23,981 --> 00:13:27,130
I sit back and watch and he just never
slowed down.

255
00:13:27,131 --> 00:13:29,640
He kept going in and kept lighting that
fucker up.

256
00:13:29,641 --> 00:13:31,000
I'm like,
this guy's insane.

257
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:34,210
But like a dude like that,
that guy can handle being high.

258
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,800
He understands how to be high,
but for someone who's not really that

259
00:13:38,801 --> 00:13:40,810
experienced that it man,
especially in a car,

260
00:13:40,811 --> 00:13:42,760
it's not a good idea.
Yeah,

261
00:13:42,761 --> 00:13:44,440
for sure.
It's got to be.

262
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:47,200
Again,
if you can just focus on performance and

263
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:49,340
it can.
It takes a while to get used to it.

264
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:52,930
I think what my point was,
the performance varies considerably

265
00:13:52,931 --> 00:13:56,110
dependent upon the individual,
so I don't think you could even do like

266
00:13:56,111 --> 00:13:58,630
an across the board performance tests,
like say,

267
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:01,870
Oh,
we've shown that this guy under five

268
00:14:01,871 --> 00:14:05,410
joints can do BMX flips because a lot of
those bmx dudes,

269
00:14:05,411 --> 00:14:07,720
they could do that shit drunk too.
You know what I mean?

270
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,730
Yeah.
I didn't have to be an individual

271
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:11,200
examination.
Yeah.

272
00:14:11,201 --> 00:14:15,130
The the part that I really liked about
exercising and playing racquetball with

273
00:14:15,131 --> 00:14:20,131
marijuana is that sometimes it would be
so easy to forget the score and then you

274
00:14:20,741 --> 00:14:22,300
realize you're not really playing for
the score.

275
00:14:22,301 --> 00:14:25,990
It doesn't really matter and you're just
so into the moment and playing.

276
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:27,710
Just Joanne.
Yeah,

277
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:30,520
just enjoying their movements and there
is this competition,

278
00:14:30,521 --> 00:14:35,020
but it's about helping each other do
your best and then the score.

279
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:36,980
Yeah.
That's the one downside of,

280
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:38,720
you know,
your height.

281
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:44,440
I'll try and keep track of the score.
You needed someone there who's sober to

282
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:49,500
hire someone to do with a clicker,
but we can't be bothered.

283
00:14:50,171 --> 00:14:51,950
Man.
Will you just give each of the

284
00:14:51,951 --> 00:14:55,190
participation trophies like they're
doing with kids today where everybody

285
00:14:55,191 --> 00:14:56,930
gets a trophy?
Don't worry about the score.

286
00:14:56,990 --> 00:14:58,760
Just play.
Just keep playing.

287
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:00,080
Good one.
I don't know.

288
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:05,030
I think this idea though of science and
the being rigorous about things.

289
00:15:05,031 --> 00:15:06,230
Yes.
Yeah.

290
00:15:06,231 --> 00:15:09,920
I mean I saw something that you did
about the aliens and I thought you did.

291
00:15:09,921 --> 00:15:13,050
I'm like a TV documentary.
I thought you did great about it.

292
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:15,230
Thank very.
Yeah,

293
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:16,790
I was impressed.
The alien.

294
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:17,361
Listen,
man.

295
00:15:17,361 --> 00:15:20,780
Nobody wants to believe more than me.
Nobody wants to be more than me.

296
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:23,210
Believe me.
I fucking want to believe,

297
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:26,270
but when I'm honest and I look at all
the evidence,

298
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,680
it's not their folks.

299
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:30,170
There's nothing there.
There's nothing there.

300
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,600
There's like a few people have seen some
stuff.

301
00:15:32,601 --> 00:15:34,430
There's some people that wrote
affidavits.

302
00:15:34,431 --> 00:15:35,870
Other than that,
you got nothing.

303
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:39,650
You got some shaky ass pictures.
That could be anything.

304
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:42,560
Could be a bird that got shot out of a
cannon.

305
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:46,610
We some of these photos that they're
convinced or from another planet like,

306
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,320
are you fucking serious?
Man?

307
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:50,720
I think it'd be anything.
He knows what that is.

308
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:53,360
I think the bigger question is if it's
true,

309
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:54,650
then what?
Yeah,

310
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:57,050
and that's what I've tried to look at
and so for me,

311
00:15:57,051 --> 00:16:01,580
if it's true that there's aliens from
here somewhere else that are here,

312
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:06,050
what would I do differently in my life?
Do I really need to solve that mystery?

313
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,800
Which doesn't seem very compelling.
It doesn't seem likely,

314
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:13,370
but it wouldn't.
I think it's a way to be connected to

315
00:16:13,371 --> 00:16:14,150
something broader.

316
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:16,640
It's like a spiritual urging.
I think it's a.

317
00:16:16,641 --> 00:16:19,010
it's like a secular Jesus.
Yeah,

318
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:21,870
that's a really think it is and I don't
think I'm the only one.

319
00:16:21,871 --> 00:16:23,990
It's not like I don't even think this is
my theory.

320
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:28,460
I think other people definitely thought
this up that there's some sort of a

321
00:16:28,461 --> 00:16:32,540
connection between people that don't
want to believe in religion and don't

322
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:36,140
want to believe in any sort of ancient
ideologies,

323
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:41,200
but they desperately want some superior
and so they reach out to the skies and

324
00:16:42,471 --> 00:16:47,471
some of them get fixated on the idea of
maybe even they have been personally

325
00:16:47,751 --> 00:16:50,270
visited because it makes them more
significant.

326
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:54,080
It gives her life a bit more meaning,
you know you were chosen,

327
00:16:54,081 --> 00:16:56,750
were testing,
you were trying you out conveniently,

328
00:16:56,751 --> 00:16:59,420
always while you're dreaming,
but trust me,

329
00:16:59,421 --> 00:17:00,560
dude,
it's really happening.

330
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:02,620
You're not just sleeping and dreaming
something crazy.

331
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:04,910
No,
you are actually on a spaceship and so

332
00:17:04,911 --> 00:17:07,610
you get these people that are kind of
delusional and when you look at the

333
00:17:07,611 --> 00:17:11,900
sheer raw numbers of people in this
country and then you look at the Ufo

334
00:17:11,901 --> 00:17:14,180
story stories and go,
how many of these people could be

335
00:17:14,181 --> 00:17:16,280
delusional?
Could it be all of them?

336
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:19,400
Could it be some of them?
Could it be most of them?

337
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:23,060
What's the real number?
And that was the the cold hard thing

338
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:26,480
that we got to on that Scifi show
because it doesn't discount the

339
00:17:26,481 --> 00:17:31,040
possibility of definitely not of
extraterrestrial life and definitely not

340
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:34,520
of people being visited.
It's entirely possible that

341
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:39,260
extraterrestrial life has visited or
observed us and there was a unique

342
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:44,150
unique moment where someone was there
and witnessed it and maybe even those in

343
00:17:44,151 --> 00:17:47,060
contact with them and then they took off
and they were gone and they never

344
00:17:47,061 --> 00:17:49,800
returned again.
That is entirely possible because that's

345
00:17:49,801 --> 00:17:50,400
entirely

346
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:55,400
what we would do if we could just go
from planet to planet as dumb as we are

347
00:17:55,531 --> 00:17:57,570
now.
If we could just go from planet to

348
00:17:57,571 --> 00:17:59,810
planet and do studies,
fuck yeah,

349
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:03,030
we would do it and if we found an
intelligent life form that was like more

350
00:18:03,031 --> 00:18:04,890
primitive than us,
like cave people,

351
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:09,120
like some 2001 with the monolith,
you know,

352
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:12,090
if we found something like that,
you don't think we'd go say hi.

353
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,820
Of course we would say hi.
We would definitely say hi,

354
00:18:14,821 --> 00:18:18,600
and then we jet back off at our fucking
sleep machine off into the skies.

355
00:18:18,601 --> 00:18:20,580
We would do exactly what we think they
would do.

356
00:18:20,581 --> 00:18:20,880
Well,

357
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,210
you could make the case that we already
know by looking at these tribes in the

358
00:18:24,211 --> 00:18:29,211
Amazon that are as if living cave men
without much contact and we try more and

359
00:18:30,691 --> 00:18:33,400
more now just to let them alone.
But when you go there,

360
00:18:33,401 --> 00:18:38,401
they're wearing Nike's
fucking Koby Bryant tee shirts on Dev.

361
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:41,250
Like mickey mouse hats.
I mean,

362
00:18:41,251 --> 00:18:43,230
it's weird.
You see these people in the jungle and

363
00:18:43,231 --> 00:18:45,000
they have all this western clothing and
you're like,

364
00:18:45,001 --> 00:18:46,350
wow,
it's so weird,

365
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,770
but yet they're living like an
indigenous tribe.

366
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,950
Yeah.
There's very few that are still pretty

367
00:18:52,951 --> 00:18:57,951
uncontacted primitive and I actually did
a pod ceremony one time with some native

368
00:18:59,311 --> 00:19:02,610
American church Shaman to how many
people can say that and,

369
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:04,283
but,
but,

370
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:05,610
but,
but this was,

371
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:10,590
a bunch of people can say that,
but they wanted to see what a friend of

372
00:19:10,591 --> 00:19:13,270
mine who was helping them with their
sheep was,

373
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:14,520
uh,
using [inaudible].

374
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:18,770
It seemed to help him get stronger and
it was Mtma and so some novel,

375
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:23,370
it wouldn't.
When they would go off and do a pod

376
00:19:23,371 --> 00:19:27,750
ceremonies somewhere else,
he would tend to their animals,

377
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,640
sheep,
ecstasy.

378
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:30,091
No,
no,

379
00:19:30,091 --> 00:19:30,480
no,
no,

380
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,320
no.
I'm sorry.

381
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:32,850
No.
Was it,

382
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:34,620
did you understand what he was saying?
The.

383
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,690
Okay,
I skipped those.

384
00:19:35,691 --> 00:19:38,610
Just trying to follow.
I think we might've gone too deep for

385
00:19:38,611 --> 00:19:43,611
this episode that I'm,
a friend of mine was living out with the

386
00:19:44,701 --> 00:19:46,440
Navajos to kind of get his head
straight.

387
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:49,890
Okay.
And he would help take care of their

388
00:19:49,891 --> 00:19:54,660
animals when they,
this male female shamans both would go

389
00:19:54,661 --> 00:19:56,530
off to do pod ceremonies.
Oh Wow.

390
00:19:56,680 --> 00:20:00,030
He stayed out there for about a year and
he kind of put himself together and they

391
00:20:00,031 --> 00:20:03,630
said,
what helped you and we're interested in

392
00:20:03,631 --> 00:20:06,270
what your medicine is.
And he said it was Mtma.

393
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:09,900
And they said,
well we'd be interested in trying to

394
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:15,050
experience Mtma.
So I was invited out there and we ended

395
00:20:16,231 --> 00:20:21,231
up doing this ceremony in a Navajo and
they only spoke Navajo.

396
00:20:21,751 --> 00:20:26,751
They didn't speak English at all.
And there was this like in the western

397
00:20:26,821 --> 00:20:30,230
movies there was try a trail of dust
coming in.

398
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:35,170
Somebody came on horseback to be our
translator and it was there.

399
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,770
It was their 17 year old niece.
Holy Shit.

400
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:45,830
And she came
to mediate during this mtma experience

401
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:51,650
and it became clear that this was really
for her,

402
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,460
not so much for them to,
for,

403
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:56,740
for,
for them to show their seminar,

404
00:20:56,770 --> 00:20:58,180
who,
who's torn between the different

405
00:20:58,181 --> 00:21:00,880
cultures that,
that something about our culture.

406
00:21:00,881 --> 00:21:04,540
We wanted what they had or was we saw
and respected it.

407
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:09,710
Wow.
And the and a lot happened in and the,

408
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:14,950
it was wonderful in all different ways
and there are some important healings,

409
00:21:14,951 --> 00:21:16,490
but in the morning,
um,

410
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:18,520
when we were going,
this young woman

411
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:26,300
was going to get back on her horse and
she had 17 magazine and was reading it

412
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:30,430
and that's where I started figuring out
that,

413
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:33,490
you know,
even out in the reservation in these

414
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:39,070
protected culture is that the
globalization of ideas and Internet and

415
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:44,160
five casts and people are being exposed
to ideas that they wouldn't have

416
00:21:44,831 --> 00:21:47,320
normally been exposed to even in China.

417
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,670
I mean,
they're having to do so much just kind

418
00:21:48,671 --> 00:21:50,830
of sensor stuff.
Yeah.

419
00:21:50,831 --> 00:21:54,310
There's an explosion of thinking and
ideas going on right now.

420
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:56,680
It's a very strange,
strange time.

421
00:21:56,890 --> 00:21:58,780
Yeah.
I'm going to come to that and I think

422
00:21:58,781 --> 00:22:01,990
people are getting unsettled because
things they had thought were true and

423
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:04,000
rigid.
Part of their frameworks are,

424
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:08,050
are different than other places.
And how many people speak Navajo?

425
00:22:08,051 --> 00:22:10,570
Exclusively.
There's a bunch.

426
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:13,150
That's insane.
I didn't even know that that existed.

427
00:22:13,151 --> 00:22:15,150
I didn't know that inside of this
country's,

428
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:19,810
there were entire cultures of people
that speak in the original native

429
00:22:19,811 --> 00:22:21,820
language.
Wow.

430
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:23,440
Yeah.
I didn't know that existed.

431
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:24,930
Well,
it's probably very,

432
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,660
you know,
thin at these upper generations because

433
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:28,131
the,
the,

434
00:22:28,131 --> 00:22:29,460
your younger ones are

435
00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:34,790
arguably the best sounding.
Their language is like the coolest

436
00:22:34,791 --> 00:22:37,520
sounding language ever.
It's got that vendor,

437
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:38,640
you know,
there's like a,

438
00:22:38,641 --> 00:22:41,690
a sound to it.
Like there's something to their accent

439
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:44,900
that just A.
I guess it's like we're programmed to

440
00:22:44,901 --> 00:22:49,370
think of native Americans.
It's like spiritual and authentic,

441
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:51,290
you know,
there's like this sound to it.

442
00:22:51,291 --> 00:22:54,410
Like,
do you remember that scene with Clint

443
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:57,560
Eastwood?
Was it the outlaw Josey Wales where he

444
00:22:57,561 --> 00:23:01,190
met that Indian chief and they got
together and these are my words of life

445
00:23:01,191 --> 00:23:04,750
and also my words of death.
Do you remember that speech Jamie did?

446
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:07,840
I'm talking about dude,
you got to find the.

447
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,940
Is so powerful.
It's like one of my favorite moments in

448
00:23:10,941 --> 00:23:11,960
a movie.
I mean,

449
00:23:11,961 --> 00:23:14,060
those clinics should.
Movies were all ridiculous,

450
00:23:14,061 --> 00:23:16,180
right?
Like when you stop and look at it is

451
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:19,580
they're all ridiculous,
but there was something to that genre

452
00:23:19,581 --> 00:23:24,581
that spaghetti western genre because it,
it wasn't just that it was,

453
00:23:24,711 --> 00:23:29,711
there were cool action movies,
but it was cool action movies that were

454
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:34,780
in some ways reminding you of how people
lived just a hundred years ago because

455
00:23:37,431 --> 00:23:41,090
these were all in the 19 sixties and
seventies and shit.

456
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:42,800
Right.
That's when they did these fucking

457
00:23:42,801 --> 00:23:47,801
movies will visit the 19 in 1870.
They were riding fucking horses

458
00:23:49,221 --> 00:23:52,850
everywhere.
I mean this literally is a hundred years

459
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:53,571
old,
you know,

460
00:23:53,571 --> 00:23:54,710
18,
65,

461
00:23:54,711 --> 00:23:57,830
they abolished slavery.
We're only talking about a hundred years

462
00:23:58,130 --> 00:24:02,270
and this cowboy western shit was going
on and for us it,

463
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:06,530
it almost like hearkens to a time right
before we fucked up the country.

464
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:13,090
Right when the first barometers on
wooden wheels rolled their platforms

465
00:24:13,731 --> 00:24:18,731
covered in tarp across the entire
continent to find a spot to have babies.

466
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:23,000
Not that it was like this perfect
paradise for got here.

467
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,800
Definitely wasn't.
Yeah,

468
00:24:24,801 --> 00:24:27,080
that's a.
that's an interesting perspective that

469
00:24:27,081 --> 00:24:32,060
some people grab onto that the native
American people were completely a piece

470
00:24:32,061 --> 00:24:33,860
where each with each other,
they definitely weren't.

471
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:37,280
There are amazing.
It's nothing to take away from their

472
00:24:37,281 --> 00:24:40,850
cultures and I'm.
I'm fascinated by native American

473
00:24:40,851 --> 00:24:41,684
culture.

474
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:46,780
It's just an amazing place that they
existed on and for so long without any

475
00:24:47,751 --> 00:24:50,060
European influence,
while all this stuff was going on in the

476
00:24:50,061 --> 00:24:52,130
world,
they were living here in a very,

477
00:24:52,131 --> 00:24:56,120
very different way in a lot of ways and
intensely harmonious way with their

478
00:24:56,121 --> 00:24:57,020
environment,
with,

479
00:24:57,060 --> 00:25:01,340
with nature itself and I think we like
look at that and we have all these deep

480
00:25:01,341 --> 00:25:04,760
spiritual attachments to that.
It's like it's like it means it's very

481
00:25:04,761 --> 00:25:07,190
significant,
but they fought amongst each other so

482
00:25:07,191 --> 00:25:12,170
much and that was their sport in a way
that they had that as killing.

483
00:25:12,171 --> 00:25:15,590
It was.
It was a way of becoming trained as a

484
00:25:15,591 --> 00:25:20,591
Predator and somehow that's so deep in
us and that's part of the question.

485
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:27,510
I think for me,
the psychedelics and therapy is.

486
00:25:27,511 --> 00:25:30,170
Is there a way to get that out of the
human heart?

487
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:30,980
In a way?

488
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:34,160
I think the way to get it out as the way
that it's getting out right now,

489
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:37,970
and it's through information,
I think that when even you look at these

490
00:25:37,971 --> 00:25:41,000
native American tribes that were
harmonious with each other,

491
00:25:41,001 --> 00:25:42,860
right?
They have these very close knit bonds

492
00:25:42,861 --> 00:25:44,960
and close tribes and they're very
communal,

493
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:48,400
but they didn't know these other people
that were exactly like damn.

494
00:25:48,401 --> 00:25:51,980
There were a hundred miles away and they
assume the worst and they assume the

495
00:25:51,981 --> 00:25:53,600
worst too,
and they looked at each other and there

496
00:25:53,601 --> 00:25:55,370
was not enough communication.
They couldn't.

497
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,620
They couldn't interact with each other
instantaneously.

498
00:25:57,770 --> 00:25:59,390
They couldn't get to understand each
other.

499
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:01,940
Like we've talked about this on this
podcast before,

500
00:26:01,941 --> 00:26:06,941
but if it wasn't until like about a
hundred years ago where a boat showing

501
00:26:07,341 --> 00:26:12,341
up didn't mean.
I mean if you were in the 18 hundreds

502
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:16,640
and a strange boat pulled up on shore,
you're Foxville right?

503
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:20,210
This is a terrible problem.
These are monsters with swords and

504
00:26:20,211 --> 00:26:22,340
they're gonna jump off and they got to
shoot arrows at us.

505
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:26,360
That was really common.
If you got a boat that showed up a giant

506
00:26:26,361 --> 00:26:28,640
boat and a bunch of people got off your
fuck man,

507
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:33,790
you just got invaded now that means
terrorists and you want tourist dollars

508
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:37,910
and people have translators on their
phones so they could speak to each other

509
00:26:37,911 --> 00:26:39,980
that people that speak different
languages,

510
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:43,250
I mean is,
this is an amazing time.

511
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:48,560
Ms Dot amazingly strange,
but we're experiencing each other on a

512
00:26:48,721 --> 00:26:51,690
much more even playing field than ever
in the past.

513
00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:53,920
And I think that's how we can exist with
so many of them.

514
00:26:54,610 --> 00:26:56,750
Yeah.
And I think if we can see that really

515
00:26:56,780 --> 00:27:01,460
we're all more in common than we have
different and we can appreciate the

516
00:27:01,461 --> 00:27:04,250
differences rather than be fearful of
them.

517
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:09,310
And that what we have in common is this
fundamental sense of connection of being

518
00:27:10,041 --> 00:27:15,041
this web of life that really were not
virtually were pretty similar to

519
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:16,370
animals.
You know,

520
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:19,970
her way close the people at different
skin or different cultures

521
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:26,550
to be able to see that that
is who we really are.

522
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:30,620
And that acting from that and trying to
um,

523
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:34,890
work on cooperative solutions.
And I think that that's,

524
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:40,190
if we can have lots of people having
these direct experiences so that they

525
00:27:41,381 --> 00:27:46,381
can't be manipulated by politicians.
So it's about grounding this kind of

526
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,760
globalization,
but comfort with

527
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:55,980
the sense of a connection that,
that were

528
00:27:57,580 --> 00:28:01,360
able to find these bonds that they do
exist and that they can be built.

529
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:05,650
But I think one of the things that we're
seeing in this extreme oversensitivity

530
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:08,020
that we're experiencing right now,
there's,

531
00:28:08,050 --> 00:28:12,820
this is like a really interesting time
as far as like pc culture and what's,

532
00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:15,160
what you can do,
what you can't do,

533
00:28:15,161 --> 00:28:17,440
and cultural appropriation.
I mean,

534
00:28:17,441 --> 00:28:20,500
people are going after people for
cooking Mexican food that aren't

535
00:28:20,501 --> 00:28:21,510
Mexican.
Yeah.

536
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:24,520
We're trying to call that guy cultural
appropriation.

537
00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:25,150
We're trying to do,

538
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:27,480
take a Iowasca out of the,
uh,

539
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:32,700
Iowasca rituals and out of the jungles
and turn it into a therapy drug.

540
00:28:34,570 --> 00:28:37,270
But that's out of respect.
It's not out of.

541
00:28:37,610 --> 00:28:38,060
Well,
that's,

542
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:41,570
that's an interesting analogy.
It's a different thing and in a lot of

543
00:28:41,571 --> 00:28:42,410
ways.
But yeah.

544
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:44,820
Yeah,
I mean,

545
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:46,470
culture is,
can evolve.

546
00:28:46,471 --> 00:28:50,090
You just have to be acknowledging where
it comes from and try to bring you back.

547
00:28:50,570 --> 00:28:51,510
You're taking.
Yeah.

548
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:55,360
What I was gonna say though is that this
oversensitivity is just a,

549
00:28:55,470 --> 00:29:00,470
it's just a side effect of this expanded
understanding and in this expanded

550
00:29:00,801 --> 00:29:05,050
understanding now all of the different
things that are injustices in the world

551
00:29:05,051 --> 00:29:07,400
of being highlighted in a way that never
been highlighted before.

552
00:29:07,401 --> 00:29:11,420
So then people start going after them
and then pushing the line further back

553
00:29:11,570 --> 00:29:15,980
and then they start looking for other
slights that might be around,

554
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,120
you know,
other,

555
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:19,180
uh,
microaggressions,

556
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:21,320
microaggressions,
anything.

557
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:23,570
What is this white people with
dreadlocks.

558
00:29:23,571 --> 00:29:26,450
Justin Bieber adds fuel to the cultural
appropriation debate.

559
00:29:26,810 --> 00:29:28,670
First of all,
ladies and gentlemen,

560
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:31,910
all you have to do is Google dreadlocks.
That's what I did.

561
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:36,290
And I found out that the fucking ancient
Greeks were like the oldest people that

562
00:29:36,291 --> 00:29:40,190
wore greg dreadlocks like they,
they believe it might have come from the

563
00:29:40,191 --> 00:29:43,650
ancient Greeks also,
like a lot of other cultures work,

564
00:29:43,730 --> 00:29:45,010
dreadlocks,
vikings,

565
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:45,990
war,
dreadlocks.

566
00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:46,870
This,
it's,

567
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:49,840
it's,
it's a cross the board with hair folks.

568
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:51,370
Okay.
This is not a black thing.

569
00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:54,220
Not only that,
that's not what cultural appropriation

570
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:55,081
is,
kid.

571
00:29:55,081 --> 00:29:58,910
That's just style.
What cultural appropriation is is like

572
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:03,930
save these native Americans had a
specific style of clothing that you.

573
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:07,840
If you wore it,
you were a woman and you were a sacred

574
00:30:07,841 --> 00:30:12,190
person or you had a head dress that you
wore during very intense spiritual

575
00:30:12,191 --> 00:30:15,160
ceremonies and someone just started
wearing that for fun.

576
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:16,960
Someone thought it was cool to wear that
for fun.

577
00:30:16,961 --> 00:30:20,720
Well then it becomes offensive and
that's cultural appropriation because

578
00:30:20,721 --> 00:30:24,610
you this,
these people have this ritual is very

579
00:30:24,611 --> 00:30:26,440
important.
Sacred ritual in this one,

580
00:30:26,441 --> 00:30:30,460
part of that ritual,
you are defacing your mocking it openly

581
00:30:30,461 --> 00:30:32,080
and it's offensive to them.
It hurts them,

582
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:35,680
and even that's arguable.
That's cultural appropriation and I

583
00:30:35,681 --> 00:30:36,800
agree that there.

584
00:30:36,850 --> 00:30:38,860
I think if someone has something that's
sacred,

585
00:30:38,861 --> 00:30:41,710
like a head dress or something that they
specifically were,

586
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:45,400
and then you walk around and wear it,
that's kind of a Dick move,

587
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:46,830
right?
If you have to earn that

588
00:30:48,330 --> 00:30:49,163
someone.
Yeah.

589
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:52,140
Yeah.
It's like being a fake black belts or

590
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:56,350
having a fake phd or pretending that you
went to Vietnam and you didn't.

591
00:30:56,410 --> 00:30:57,910
There's a lot of those people out there,
right?

592
00:30:57,911 --> 00:31:02,911
They're all equally offensive,
but that's cultural appropriation is not

593
00:31:03,011 --> 00:31:05,800
a white guy were in dreadlocks.
It's just not okay.

594
00:31:05,801 --> 00:31:07,840
That's a kid who likes to wear his hair
like that.

595
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:12,580
Who gives a fuck and the only reason why
you give a fuck is because you've run

596
00:31:12,581 --> 00:31:15,730
out of things that are really important
to care about in your life because if

597
00:31:15,731 --> 00:31:18,280
you cared about really important shit,
you would concentrate on that.

598
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:20,170
That is a massive distraction.

599
00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:24,310
If a white kid with dreadlocks is gonna,
you're going to go out of your way to

600
00:31:24,311 --> 00:31:27,160
find anger in a white kid with
dreadlocks.

601
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:29,470
All that says to me is you need more
interests.

602
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:31,660
That's for sure.
You need more things that are

603
00:31:31,661 --> 00:31:32,610
interesting to you.
Yeah.

604
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:34,930
That's called work avoidance.
You know,

605
00:31:34,931 --> 00:31:37,960
you're just focusing on the things that
are of work avoidance.

606
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:38,780
Right?
You're right.

607
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:39,670
Yeah,
you're right.

608
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:43,750
That is a great way of approaching it.
It's exactly what it is and people do do

609
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:44,710
that.
Well,

610
00:31:44,711 --> 00:31:48,140
there's a class at leadership at the
Kennedy school that I taught.

611
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:52,060
It was taught by the only psychiatrist
I'm on the faculty,

612
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:56,050
Ron Heifetz,
and that was a big concept was that,

613
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:57,370
you know,
as a leader,

614
00:31:57,430 --> 00:32:01,210
there's just so much work avoidance
being done in different ways and how do

615
00:32:01,211 --> 00:32:04,420
you help people focus on the issues that
are

616
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,930
tearing them apart or that they're
avoiding.

617
00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:10,510
But it would be better if they try to
work on it and you know,

618
00:32:10,511 --> 00:32:15,310
that word work is weird because work
avoidance doesn't just mean like actual

619
00:32:15,311 --> 00:32:16,660
work,
like working on your job.

620
00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:19,040
It could be working on yourself,
you know,

621
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:23,220
it could mean like there's a lot of
people that get involved in wacky

622
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:27,280
behavior because they also are addicted
to cigarettes and maybe they drink too

623
00:32:27,281 --> 00:32:30,460
much so they start getting addicted to
wacky behavior as well,

624
00:32:30,461 --> 00:32:34,630
not just as a side effect of the drugs,
but also to distract them from dealing

625
00:32:34,631 --> 00:32:38,740
with the work they create.
Dramas they treat bullshit and all,

626
00:32:38,741 --> 00:32:40,190
almost like to dis,
just

627
00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:45,370
to drown out the nagging poking of all
the shit you actually need to get done.

628
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:48,800
So then he just fucking tank your life
again in this way.

629
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:51,350
Tank your life again and that way.
Yeah.

630
00:32:51,351 --> 00:32:55,790
My favorite approach to a work avoidance
is doing lots and lots of other work

631
00:32:56,210 --> 00:32:58,040
other than what's the most important
thing?

632
00:32:58,340 --> 00:32:58,791
Oh,
really?

633
00:32:58,791 --> 00:33:01,670
Do put off everything except like what
you really need to do.

634
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:02,693
Um,
I,

635
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:05,320
I catch myself doing that now and then
that's,

636
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:08,240
that's crazy.
Isn't it weird how your brain will just

637
00:33:08,241 --> 00:33:13,241
play little tricks on you like is that.
I think it's this anxiety a bit about

638
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:17,060
this is a big challenge and you don't
know until you start how it's going to

639
00:33:17,061 --> 00:33:21,140
turn out and there's lots at stake and
it's just,

640
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:23,970
it's a matter of what you tolerate from
yourself to.

641
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:29,060
And that's a weird line in the sand that
you gotta kind of learn to draw.

642
00:33:29,330 --> 00:33:32,270
If you want to actually get things done,
you got to say,

643
00:33:32,271 --> 00:33:34,010
okay,
now from,

644
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:36,380
you know,
7:00 PM to 9:00 PM,

645
00:33:36,381 --> 00:33:38,540
I do this,
this is what I'm going to do.

646
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:39,860
I want to sit down and we're going to
work.

647
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:43,770
And you beat the boss of yourself and
then you sit down and you stare at the

648
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:45,590
computer screen or stare at the
notebook.

649
00:33:45,591 --> 00:33:49,250
And you do the writing that you were
really trying to put off this hard for

650
00:33:49,251 --> 00:33:52,370
people to do though because a lot of
times your brain is very wishy washy and

651
00:33:52,371 --> 00:33:56,210
we see for our choices,
we receive our ability to open up our

652
00:33:56,211 --> 00:34:00,290
websites and just start going and what's
going on and dig.com today.

653
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,370
Oh Wow.
That's crazy.

654
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:03,950
And then next thing you know,
it's 45 minutes after you were supposed

655
00:34:03,951 --> 00:34:05,630
to start.
Yeah,

656
00:34:05,631 --> 00:34:08,420
I call it the tyranny of the empty page.

657
00:34:08,890 --> 00:34:11,930
It's just so.
But it's so nothing.

658
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:15,380
Yeah.
I sort of a weird thing to be terrified

659
00:34:15,381 --> 00:34:20,060
of what really put me at ease was one
professor when I was working on my

660
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:23,200
dissertation at the Kennedy School at
Harvard and,

661
00:34:23,201 --> 00:34:26,690
and I just had this idea that you had to
have it so good that you know,

662
00:34:27,130 --> 00:34:30,080
to be,
were they and what I was doing,

663
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:34,850
it just
doesn't start that way.

664
00:34:34,851 --> 00:34:39,851
So I had three professors but he needed
a fourth on my committee and he was the

665
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:42,860
academic dean.
He's terrific.

666
00:34:42,861 --> 00:34:44,190
But I said to him,
you know,

667
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,750
should I,
um,

668
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:48,710
because you're so busy,
should I just worked through with the

669
00:34:48,711 --> 00:34:53,000
other professors and then just give it
to you and the final phase just for you

670
00:34:53,001 --> 00:34:54,890
to read over.
And he said,

671
00:34:54,891 --> 00:34:57,320
no,
give it to me in the junk phase because

672
00:34:57,321 --> 00:34:59,360
that's when your comments are the most
important.

673
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,620
But what it was got,
he acknowledged that there was a junk

674
00:35:03,621 --> 00:35:06,350
phase and that helped me feel like,
okay,

675
00:35:06,351 --> 00:35:08,780
I can start because I'm producing Janet,
but it's,

676
00:35:09,330 --> 00:35:11,300
you know,
you just keep trying to refine it or

677
00:35:11,301 --> 00:35:11,871
fight it.
Oh,

678
00:35:11,871 --> 00:35:13,190
that's so important.
I mean,

679
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:18,050
should fear has this little piece of
paper that he has glued or taped to his

680
00:35:18,051 --> 00:35:22,820
laptop and it says the first draft,
first draft of everything is Shit.

681
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:27,140
It's Ernest Hemingway and it's right
underneath the screen.

682
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:31,100
That's such a good point.
You really have to go over things.

683
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:33,650
Writing is weird.
And whenever I read something that's

684
00:35:33,651 --> 00:35:36,940
like ponderous and just labored,
I did this.

685
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:39,900
You read this again,
you got to read it after you write it,

686
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:41,280
you got to write it,
you've got to read it.

687
00:35:41,281 --> 00:35:43,020
And you've got to rewrite it and that's
where,

688
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:46,410
for me getting stone and editing stuff
that I've written,

689
00:35:46,411 --> 00:35:49,650
it's harder sometimes I can write when
I'm stoned,

690
00:35:49,651 --> 00:35:53,460
but it's very early and it sometimes
will be like,

691
00:35:53,461 --> 00:35:54,860
um,
you know,

692
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:58,080
a half hour for a paragraph or so
because I'm thinking about all the

693
00:35:58,081 --> 00:36:01,560
different words in ways and what you
used to write with.

694
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:06,300
I'm
to write with.

695
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:08,840
Do you have like particular software?
Do you write with?

696
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:11,550
Do you have anything?
I'm just Microsoft word.

697
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,730
Do you ever try right room?
Do you know what right room is?

698
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,460
Um,
no right room is this program where the

699
00:36:17,461 --> 00:36:21,570
entire screen goes black and I'll show
it to the entire screen,

700
00:36:21,571 --> 00:36:26,100
goes black and all you get is these
green letters and you can't access your

701
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:27,690
browser.
You can't,

702
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:31,200
you can't do shit.
This is what it looks like when I write.

703
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:34,010
Oh Nice.
So it's green letters there.

704
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:35,580
You could see it up on the big screen as
well.

705
00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:38,280
Um,
so it's green letters,

706
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:42,870
black background.
And so when I write like that man,

707
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:48,030
I feel like it just owns me in and just,
I can't do anything else.

708
00:36:48,031 --> 00:36:49,860
I can't fuck off.
I can't,

709
00:36:49,861 --> 00:36:52,770
you know,
I just shut the Wifi off and Ram.

710
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:56,310
That's for me the best way,
the best way to get into it,

711
00:36:56,610 --> 00:36:57,900
you know?
Yeah.

712
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:02,550
For me it usually takes a.
I'm being like midnight or something

713
00:37:02,551 --> 00:37:04,800
like that.
Have you ever seen scrivener?

714
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:07,530
Scrivener?
Is scribner's pretty cool too.

715
00:37:07,531 --> 00:37:09,120
It's something I've been using for
years.

716
00:37:09,121 --> 00:37:11,640
It's this program that you can set it
up.

717
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:13,830
I think he set it up a bunch of
different views,

718
00:37:13,831 --> 00:37:16,200
but the one I like,
it looks like a cork board.

719
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:20,430
So you have like index cards and you can
write on index cards,

720
00:37:20,431 --> 00:37:22,980
see them up there like that.
And there were all those index cards are

721
00:37:22,981 --> 00:37:27,120
expandable.
So each one of those index cards can be,

722
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:29,880
uh,
an essay and you click on each one of

723
00:37:29,881 --> 00:37:32,880
them and then you get to notes and you,
you can,

724
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:35,520
you can open them up and read the full
extent of it.

725
00:37:35,521 --> 00:37:38,550
You can highlight things and make notes
on the highlights.

726
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:41,400
It's really cool program.
I like it a lot.

727
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:43,140
It's really cool too because I liked
the,

728
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:47,770
I like cork boards and I use them in
real life and um,

729
00:37:47,950 --> 00:37:50,820
I like,
I learned that from watching Sitcom

730
00:37:50,821 --> 00:37:53,520
writers.
Do you can you have it where you've got

731
00:37:54,130 --> 00:37:58,100
like the different columns or different
kinds of tasks and then you have them

732
00:37:58,110 --> 00:38:01,890
prioritized so you can kind of in one
glance look at.

733
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,300
I don't know,
you'd have to explore that.

734
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:06,630
Only use it for notes,
but I'm sure I'm sure it's pretty

735
00:38:06,631 --> 00:38:11,631
flexible,
but I think it's mostly a wow who,

736
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:15,000
who started using it.
I think it was a screenwriting tool

737
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:18,720
initially I think it was,
but a lot of people use it because it's

738
00:38:18,721 --> 00:38:21,270
just a,
it's really cool of you.

739
00:38:21,330 --> 00:38:24,540
What kind of stuff are you writing?
So mostly just bullshit.

740
00:38:24,541 --> 00:38:27,510
Just my thoughts on things then extract,
stand up out of it,

741
00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:29,090
you know,
I'll just,

742
00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:31,290
I'll,
I'll write like long form things.

743
00:38:31,290 --> 00:38:33,390
I keep saying that I'm going to get back
to writing a blog,

744
00:38:33,391 --> 00:38:38,391
but I just never,
I never have the real itch to just tee.

745
00:38:38,890 --> 00:38:39,910
I like,
I like,

746
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:44,140
like these half process things that then
become bits,

747
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:47,250
you know,
almost like use it as a farm I guess.

748
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:50,260
Like I used to try to like write a joke
or he used to try to write like

749
00:38:50,410 --> 00:38:54,070
beginning punchline setup,
but then I realized like the best way

750
00:38:54,071 --> 00:38:58,750
for me at least with my styles to write
a bunch of shit and then find out what's

751
00:38:58,751 --> 00:39:00,540
funny about it,
you know,

752
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:05,980
is tweeting sorted for you like notes or
blog something useful?

753
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,210
Sometimes it is,
yeah.

754
00:39:07,211 --> 00:39:08,770
Sometimes it's cool.
I like tweet.

755
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,970
I like texting,
tweeting rather because you only get 140

756
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:14,980
text characters.
Those 140 characters.

757
00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:19,810
I think that's good because it makes you
economize and it makes you edit and then

758
00:39:19,811 --> 00:39:22,090
it makes you,
it makes you a better joke writer and a

759
00:39:22,091 --> 00:39:25,160
lot of ways like the actual,
like um,

760
00:39:25,690 --> 00:39:29,620
the figuring out the slams and the
punches in a joke.

761
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:33,910
I think you can get to them better when
you learn how to say funny shit on

762
00:39:33,911 --> 00:39:38,911
twitter because you only have 140
characters that small amount of text in

763
00:39:39,791 --> 00:39:41,830
this little box.
And you've got to figure out a way to

764
00:39:41,831 --> 00:39:44,050
get your point across and hopefully be
funny too,

765
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:47,650
you know,
sometimes it's just stupid texts to me.

766
00:39:47,651 --> 00:39:49,090
Like someone will say something really
stupid,

767
00:39:49,091 --> 00:39:51,630
just so silly and I just can't stop
laughing.

768
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,010
Like I think,
uh,

769
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:56,590
it's,
it's interesting like how tweets have

770
00:39:56,591 --> 00:39:59,430
like a time where they work to,
you know,

771
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:03,100
like something could have just happened
the news and then some will have the

772
00:40:03,101 --> 00:40:06,880
perfectly time ridiculous tweet and like
in that moment,

773
00:40:06,881 --> 00:40:10,070
like that dude like cracked up the whole
Party of,

774
00:40:10,130 --> 00:40:11,920
of the world,
you know,

775
00:40:12,070 --> 00:40:16,840
or that woman or whoever the hell said
it is a lot of people that like a Jenny

776
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:20,890
Johnson who was in here,
she's become famous and a working comic

777
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:24,070
from tweets just from being funny on
twitter.

778
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:25,063
Wow.
You know,

779
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:27,340
it's amazing.
Yeah,

780
00:40:27,370 --> 00:40:29,480
it's crazy.
I haven't really used that.

781
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:33,040
Well you guys use maps using.
Oh,

782
00:40:33,041 --> 00:40:35,170
we have tremendous.
Excellent.

783
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:40,320
You guys are really on the ball to when
it comes to social media and getting

784
00:40:40,330 --> 00:40:42,640
people engaged and retweeting your
stuff.

785
00:40:42,850 --> 00:40:43,370
Rice,
milk.

786
00:40:43,370 --> 00:40:45,490
I'm Marie is in charge of that and he
does great.

787
00:40:45,491 --> 00:40:48,390
We have such a seem yes,
right?

788
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:52,300
I
know you guys are amazing.

789
00:40:52,330 --> 00:40:53,470
It's so,
like I said,

790
00:40:53,471 --> 00:40:56,560
it's so important to balance out people
like meat.

791
00:40:56,860 --> 00:41:01,840
You want balance out like me,
you know what we're in the stage of the,

792
00:41:01,841 --> 00:41:04,120
um,
what I'm considering our major reality

793
00:41:04,121 --> 00:41:09,121
check of our 30 years of existence and
that's submitting the data from Mtma

794
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:13,840
assisted psychotherapy for ptsd.
These phase two studies that we've been

795
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:19,240
working on for the last 15 years and
submitting that to first off to our FDA

796
00:41:19,241 --> 00:41:24,241
consultants and then to Fda about going
to the next step about going from

797
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:31,750
exploratory studies to studies that if
they work then you get approval as a

798
00:41:31,751 --> 00:41:34,310
prescription medicine as a prescription

799
00:41:34,310 --> 00:41:35,300
treatment.
So we're,

800
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:40,360
we're bringing all of these data points
that we've gotten roughly just in this

801
00:41:42,891 --> 00:41:46,550
bunch of studies,
around $7,000,000 studies over a 105

802
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:51,580
people.
And what we're able to tell is a story

803
00:41:51,921 --> 00:41:56,600
about risk and a story about benefit for
posttraumatic stress disorder from any

804
00:41:56,601 --> 00:42:01,601
cause with Mtma assisted psychotherapy
as compared to a placebo and also from

805
00:42:05,061 --> 00:42:09,530
the literature and working with people
who have failed other medications.

806
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:13,280
It's a weird subjective subject,
isn't it?

807
00:42:13,281 --> 00:42:16,160
Like how people feel.
How do you feel about,

808
00:42:16,670 --> 00:42:18,230
you know,
your life because it's,

809
00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:22,080
it's assisted psychotherapy,
like how much of an impact you

810
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:24,380
specifically can you attribute to the
drug,

811
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,000
right?
The,

812
00:42:26,001 --> 00:42:30,680
um,
the test will actually determine that

813
00:42:30,770 --> 00:42:35,420
because one group of people will get the
therapy with a placebo.

814
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:39,680
I mean this is how we're thinking of for
phase three and this is how some of the

815
00:42:39,681 --> 00:42:41,150
studies we did with phase two.

816
00:42:41,450 --> 00:42:46,450
So I think being rigorous and skeptical
is really important.

817
00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:52,760
Super important.
So the first point is if you can do this

818
00:42:52,761 --> 00:42:56,930
with the therapy without the drug,
then why do you need the drug?

819
00:42:57,290 --> 00:43:00,020
But there's so many variables when it
comes to therapy as well,

820
00:43:00,021 --> 00:43:01,460
right?
Like the relationship between the

821
00:43:01,461 --> 00:43:03,290
therapist and the patient.
Yeah.

822
00:43:03,291 --> 00:43:06,920
There's so many variables and ranges of
individual responses.

823
00:43:06,921 --> 00:43:11,660
So there's these massive tables,
statistical tables for sample size

824
00:43:11,661 --> 00:43:16,340
calculations that help you figure out on
the basis of all these assumptions,

825
00:43:16,341 --> 00:43:20,750
how many people you need in this study
to get statistically significant

826
00:43:20,751 --> 00:43:22,220
results.
And how many do you need?

827
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:24,110
Well,
we're still working through the

828
00:43:24,111 --> 00:43:25,910
different assumptions.
I would say I'm an alien.

829
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:27,130
Let's get a million people highs.

830
00:43:29,870 --> 00:43:31,340
Well,
just think of the cost though.

831
00:43:31,890 --> 00:43:34,040
That's your problem.
It's got to be some billionaire

832
00:43:34,041 --> 00:43:35,510
character out there.
Smart.

833
00:43:35,870 --> 00:43:39,110
Once they're like Richard Branson,
Richard Branson started stitching out

834
00:43:39,111 --> 00:43:41,000
them Dma,
then we've got a party there.

835
00:43:41,010 --> 00:43:42,230
There are,
um,

836
00:43:43,310 --> 00:43:44,810
support that we're,
we're getting.

837
00:43:44,811 --> 00:43:48,620
That makes me very hopeful about our
ability to raise the money for phase

838
00:43:48,621 --> 00:43:51,200
three.
We think it's going to cost around 24 or

839
00:43:51,201 --> 00:43:52,250
$5.
Million Dollars.

840
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:54,650
Wow.
And we have about half of it already.

841
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:58,700
Wow.
Either enhanced or committed a serious

842
00:43:58,701 --> 00:44:00,140
shit.
Yeah.

843
00:44:00,141 --> 00:44:04,820
Well,
the consequences if it works is that

844
00:44:04,821 --> 00:44:09,821
then we can start setting up psychedelic
psychotherapy clinics for Mtma for ptsd.

845
00:44:10,131 --> 00:44:14,090
We can start negotiating with the va and
the Department of Defense with their

846
00:44:14,091 --> 00:44:16,410
hundreds and hundreds of thousands of
dollars.

847
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:21,560
The enormous,
um,

848
00:44:22,010 --> 00:44:27,010
last year was about $6,000,000,000 that
the va spent in disability payments for

849
00:44:27,141 --> 00:44:32,141
about 600,000 veterans that are disabled
to some degree with ptsd just for Ptsd,

850
00:44:35,871 --> 00:44:39,210
just for bdsd around $6,000,000,000
every year.

851
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:42,030
Why?
Just in disability payments for,

852
00:44:42,390 --> 00:44:46,410
that's why the human sufferings who the
money.

853
00:44:46,470 --> 00:44:48,750
Oh my God.
Because the.

854
00:44:48,870 --> 00:44:53,870
It's hard when people are traumatized.
I would've never guessed it was that

855
00:44:54,421 --> 00:44:58,830
high $6,000,000,000 just for ptsd.
I would have thought just for disability

856
00:44:58,831 --> 00:44:59,580
payments.
That's,

857
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:02,310
that's not cost.
One other thing.

858
00:45:03,630 --> 00:45:06,390
And that's a lot of.
And what we're able to,

859
00:45:07,110 --> 00:45:10,770
what we've been able to show what we say
in this group of a hundred and five

860
00:45:10,771 --> 00:45:15,060
people is that,
and this is ptsd from any cause,

861
00:45:15,061 --> 00:45:16,640
not just war,
but um,

862
00:45:16,710 --> 00:45:21,710
childhood sexual abuse or rape or
workplace accident trauma of any kind

863
00:45:23,041 --> 00:45:28,041
that a substantial percentage of these
people can have significant improvement.

864
00:45:28,470 --> 00:45:32,580
And how that's valuated is.
Fortunately for us,

865
00:45:33,150 --> 00:45:38,150
there is a independent rater
administered scale for not for symptoms

866
00:45:41,010 --> 00:45:45,030
of ptsd and it's called the cap.
So the clinician administered PTSD

867
00:45:45,031 --> 00:45:48,180
scale.
It's the gold standard developed by the

868
00:45:48,181 --> 00:45:51,660
Va,
used by the FDA to approve Zoloft and

869
00:45:51,661 --> 00:45:56,661
Paxil for ptsd and it's just been
revised from caps for to campus five,

870
00:45:57,271 --> 00:46:02,230
so it's a work in progress over decades
and so this.

871
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:07,260
This is the objective scale and people
do have to tell their story to an

872
00:46:09,061 --> 00:46:14,061
independent rater and the way that the
independent rating system is going to be

873
00:46:14,371 --> 00:46:18,690
done is going to be a whole pool of them
that are calibrated with each other.

874
00:46:18,691 --> 00:46:22,420
Interrater reliability and they know how
to administer this and they were

875
00:46:22,421 --> 00:46:27,421
randomly assigned to what we think will
be about 230 people for one phase three

876
00:46:28,651 --> 00:46:31,050
study.
That's probably what we're going to be

877
00:46:31,051 --> 00:46:36,051
proposing and we need to have those
studies to large scale phase three

878
00:46:36,061 --> 00:46:41,061
studies and what we're going to have is
these raiders will be randomly assigned

879
00:46:41,670 --> 00:46:46,620
to one of the subjects and they won't
necessarily know is this the one year

880
00:46:46,621 --> 00:46:48,450
follow up the two month follow up.

881
00:46:48,450 --> 00:46:52,080
That really is the primary outcome
measure or the baseline.

882
00:46:53,340 --> 00:46:57,870
So the independent raters are really
important because for skeptical people

883
00:46:57,990 --> 00:47:02,190
in science,
the double blind is a key development.

884
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:07,560
How you do an experiment,
you shouldn't know the two conditions

885
00:47:07,561 --> 00:47:11,160
she shouldn't know which is the
experimental one in which isn't because

886
00:47:11,220 --> 00:47:16,220
your biases might make you suddenly see
what you want to see.

887
00:47:17,180 --> 00:47:20,100
Right.
And it's very hard not to do that.

888
00:47:20,101 --> 00:47:23,340
That's kind of a human tendency.
So the idea has been these placebo

889
00:47:23,341 --> 00:47:28,110
controlled double blind studies,
but it's good in theory,

890
00:47:28,111 --> 00:47:31,210
but with a psychedelic
use,

891
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:35,140
people tell if they've got a placebo
that does nothing or a psychedelic drug.

892
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:40,390
It's a fundamental problem of this
research and that's why these

893
00:47:40,391 --> 00:47:44,620
independent raters are even more
important for people to have confidence

894
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:49,840
in the results.
And what we've tried is a series of

895
00:47:49,841 --> 00:47:54,820
studies giving low dose Mtma and
comparing it to medium and full dose.

896
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:59,770
And so the idea we thought was that if
people are confused about which dose

897
00:47:59,771 --> 00:48:03,100
they're getting,
but then we can show a dose response

898
00:48:03,101 --> 00:48:05,650
relationship,
then that's the double blind.

899
00:48:05,651 --> 00:48:09,950
That's the solution to the double blind
problem is that everybody knows they're

900
00:48:09,951 --> 00:48:12,520
getting Mtma,
but they don't know what dose they're

901
00:48:12,521 --> 00:48:15,700
getting and so you have to show the
people to get the higher dose,

902
00:48:15,701 --> 00:48:20,701
do better than the people that get the
lower dose and the people patients might

903
00:48:22,541 --> 00:48:24,970
not know.
Therapists could be confused that that's

904
00:48:24,971 --> 00:48:26,100
the ideal.
So that's,

905
00:48:26,140 --> 00:48:31,140
that's what we're heading for and that's
what we've spent the last 10 years or so

906
00:48:32,441 --> 00:48:35,280
researching with different low doses of
Mtma,

907
00:48:35,290 --> 00:48:37,300
25 milligrams,
30 milligrams,

908
00:48:37,301 --> 00:48:40,920
40 milligrams,
75 milligrams,

909
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:45,960
101 slash 25 and we would always have
this possibility of half the initial

910
00:48:47,351 --> 00:48:52,270
dose administered one and a half to two
and a half hours later to prolong the

911
00:48:52,271 --> 00:48:54,940
experience and make it an eight hour
therapy session.

912
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:57,670
So when these people were getting this a
sec,

913
00:48:57,671 --> 00:49:00,790
they're getting it or Mtma they're
getting it in a clinical setting.

914
00:49:00,970 --> 00:49:02,230
Yeah,
they're getting it in a clinical

915
00:49:02,231 --> 00:49:07,231
setting.
How often a w s three times three to

916
00:49:07,781 --> 00:49:10,630
five weeks apart in case.
So that's.

917
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:14,830
And it's a three and a half month
therapy process of weekly psychotherapy.

918
00:49:15,310 --> 00:49:20,310
So the emphasis is on the psychotherapy,
the preparation,

919
00:49:20,860 --> 00:49:25,860
the therapeutic alliance,
and then after three weeks there's the

920
00:49:26,201 --> 00:49:31,201
initial MTMA session and it takes place
in a special treatment center treatment

921
00:49:32,951 --> 00:49:37,660
room where there's a male,
female co therapist team with the

922
00:49:37,661 --> 00:49:38,660
person,
the person,

923
00:49:38,690 --> 00:49:41,470
the patient is having their blood
pressure monitored,

924
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:43,360
they're having their temperature
monitored,

925
00:49:43,660 --> 00:49:45,190
they're being videotaped,
the whole thing.

926
00:49:45,191 --> 00:49:47,710
And there's video tapes on the therapist
as well.

927
00:49:47,740 --> 00:49:52,660
We're trying to understand about the
method and the experiment.

928
00:49:53,410 --> 00:49:56,500
This portion of it,
the session is about eight hours

929
00:49:56,820 --> 00:49:57,653
treasonous.

930
00:49:57,700 --> 00:49:59,880
Who's auditing all this footage?
We are,

931
00:49:59,881 --> 00:50:03,580
we've loading it up or we don't.
Um,

932
00:50:04,540 --> 00:50:05,373
we're,
we're,

933
00:50:05,380 --> 00:50:07,960
we're not having somebody audit all of
it.

934
00:50:07,961 --> 00:50:12,160
We have the therapists.
I'm sort of note which are the decisive

935
00:50:12,161 --> 00:50:14,320
moments.
So I stuff on youtube,

936
00:50:14,350 --> 00:50:15,780
we're developing.
This is.

937
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:16,960
Yeah.
Actually.

938
00:50:17,110 --> 00:50:20,590
So in order to train therapists,
the best way to train therapists is to

939
00:50:20,591 --> 00:50:24,430
show here's videotapes of actual
patients under MTMA.

940
00:50:24,431 --> 00:50:27,590
And this is how they're,
it's poetry,

941
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:29,050
it's,
it's Po,

942
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:34,120
it's symbolic poetry.
People talk in terms of imagery because

943
00:50:34,311 --> 00:50:38,480
half the time their eyes are closed.
I'm listening to music having just their

944
00:50:38,481 --> 00:50:41,240
own private experience,
the other half of the time and more or

945
00:50:41,241 --> 00:50:44,160
less they're communicating with the
therapists

946
00:50:45,830 --> 00:50:49,840
and it varies and there's no particular
order of things.

947
00:50:49,841 --> 00:50:52,520
So it's basically,
and this is what I felt with the native

948
00:50:52,521 --> 00:50:56,990
Americans with the,
when we did Mtma with the pod circle,

949
00:50:57,230 --> 00:51:00,110
that they had these elaborate rituals
that,

950
00:51:00,170 --> 00:51:01,820
you know,
we went through the whole night that

951
00:51:01,821 --> 00:51:04,310
were beautiful and filled with these
rich symbols.

952
00:51:04,690 --> 00:51:07,490
Um,
but then they went,

953
00:51:07,970 --> 00:51:10,540
so they did some of their opening
prayers and they want to know what we're

954
00:51:10,550 --> 00:51:14,060
going to do and we didn't have anything.
He was like,

955
00:51:14,061 --> 00:51:16,040
well,
we just sit around and somebody says

956
00:51:16,190 --> 00:51:21,140
it's kind of a more free form.
It felt that we had like a poverty of

957
00:51:21,141 --> 00:51:25,210
ritual,
but also freedom to,

958
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:29,060
to explore like that.
And that's what we try to provide in

959
00:51:29,061 --> 00:51:34,061
this mtma experience that people have
their unconscious as the guide.

960
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:38,060
And we're not the guide.
We're not steering them anywhere.

961
00:51:38,061 --> 00:51:40,720
There's all these techniques.
We know we're not a,

962
00:51:41,210 --> 00:51:46,210
we're responding to this emergence of
material that's been catalyzed by the

963
00:51:46,371 --> 00:51:47,720
relationship,
the setting.

964
00:51:47,721 --> 00:51:52,721
And then the drug and we're supporting
this emergence and different people will

965
00:51:54,110 --> 00:51:58,640
sometimes go to the trauma first or not
talk about it till the fifth hour or

966
00:51:58,641 --> 00:52:03,641
they'll go to childhood experiences that
were supportive to build strength or

967
00:52:03,891 --> 00:52:08,390
they'll be,
but often it's in the symbolic language

968
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:11,360
and they're sort of telling themselves a
story.

969
00:52:12,050 --> 00:52:16,520
Wow.
And that story can reorder the neural

970
00:52:16,521 --> 00:52:21,521
networks and their brain and deemphasize
activity in certain fear centers of the

971
00:52:22,330 --> 00:52:25,850
Medola and can change how memories are
stored.

972
00:52:26,270 --> 00:52:31,160
We're just sending Mtma to Rockefeller
University where one of the leading

973
00:52:31,161 --> 00:52:34,760
scientists and anxiety is going to start
some studies when animals,

974
00:52:34,761 --> 00:52:35,760
mice,
rats,

975
00:52:35,761 --> 00:52:37,280
I'm not sure which,
um,

976
00:52:37,820 --> 00:52:42,820
and trying to look at fear extinction
and memory reconsolidation and how mtma

977
00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:45,020
effects that.
Whoa.

978
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:46,520
Yeah.
So we're starting to get,

979
00:52:46,521 --> 00:52:50,810
I fear extinction,
but through giving someone mdm may at

980
00:52:51,050 --> 00:52:53,990
least lessons anxiety.
Yeah.

981
00:52:53,991 --> 00:52:57,590
So it,
it means that when you have memory,

982
00:52:58,040 --> 00:53:00,160
you react with fear all the time.
That's.

983
00:53:01,370 --> 00:53:03,620
And this,
this fear has never fully been

984
00:53:03,621 --> 00:53:05,360
processed.
It's always like,

985
00:53:05,361 --> 00:53:09,410
it's about happening.
It's not been fully processed because

986
00:53:09,411 --> 00:53:11,430
it's been so scary.
Right?

987
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:14,240
More emotionally rich.
Jay,

988
00:53:14,630 --> 00:53:19,630
so with the Mtma you can help people
through this way of reducing the fear

989
00:53:20,301 --> 00:53:22,600
response,
their activity and they mingle is

990
00:53:22,610 --> 00:53:23,990
reduced.
Wow.

991
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:25,290
And so people can

992
00:53:26,490 --> 00:53:29,550
have the content without the fearful
emotion.

993
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:33,180
So as some sort of a bridge or a
blocker,

994
00:53:33,940 --> 00:53:35,710
a yes.
Yeah,

995
00:53:36,150 --> 00:53:39,810
but it changes the structure of a memory
to that person because

996
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:42,830
it changes how the.
Ma'Am,

997
00:53:42,870 --> 00:53:47,820
every time you have a memory you have to
consolidate from different parts of your

998
00:53:47,821 --> 00:53:49,980
brain.
Then you reconsolidate the memory.

999
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:51,930
Yeah.
That's why people have weird false

1000
00:53:51,931 --> 00:53:52,681
memories,
right?

1001
00:53:52,681 --> 00:53:54,480
Yeah.
They would swear were real.

1002
00:53:54,590 --> 00:53:55,430
Yeah.
Yeah.

1003
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:58,740
Your memories change over time,
but it's a memory of a memory that

1004
00:53:58,741 --> 00:54:00,840
you're retelling.
It's almost like you're like,

1005
00:54:00,841 --> 00:54:04,080
if someone you know that had a story and
they did something and they told it to

1006
00:54:04,081 --> 00:54:06,810
you and then you tell your friends about
that story,

1007
00:54:06,990 --> 00:54:07,890
that how,
Hey,

1008
00:54:07,891 --> 00:54:09,720
I know Bob's story.
Let me tell you Bob Story,

1009
00:54:09,721 --> 00:54:11,970
but you don't really know Bob's story
because you only know it from him.

1010
00:54:12,060 --> 00:54:12,810
Yeah.
You know what I mean?

1011
00:54:12,810 --> 00:54:16,650
Like you weren't there when it happened
and I think that's some of what happens

1012
00:54:16,651 --> 00:54:19,320
with Lee's,
my memories as they get older and older.

1013
00:54:19,321 --> 00:54:20,390
I'm like,
what is this?

1014
00:54:20,391 --> 00:54:23,420
This is a memory of a memory that I had.
Yeah.

1015
00:54:23,450 --> 00:54:25,050
You have to double check.
Yeah,

1016
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:30,200
a lot.
And what happens is that people's memory

1017
00:54:30,991 --> 00:54:35,760
for the trauma actually gets better with
Mtma.

1018
00:54:35,790 --> 00:54:39,330
You can somehow another change what that
memory is.

1019
00:54:39,450 --> 00:54:40,231
No,
you know,

1020
00:54:40,231 --> 00:54:43,570
that's the beauty part of it.
Do you change your reaction to them?

1021
00:54:43,810 --> 00:54:47,280
But I mean with that is to you like the
feeling tone.

1022
00:54:47,310 --> 00:54:47,800
Yeah.
So,

1023
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:52,800
so because these memories were so scary,
they've been suppressed but,

1024
00:54:53,490 --> 00:54:56,910
but not successfully.
They're not fully integrated.

1025
00:54:56,911 --> 00:55:01,911
Still activating fury actions on
frequently and so when you can feel

1026
00:55:03,541 --> 00:55:08,541
peaceful and then bringing up the
memories and then because you're feeling

1027
00:55:09,151 --> 00:55:11,790
peaceful,
people remember even better.

1028
00:55:11,820 --> 00:55:14,430
You know what you guys should really do.
If you really want to prove the effect

1029
00:55:14,431 --> 00:55:19,431
of city of effectiveness of Mtma,
you should go to Worldstar hip hop.com

1030
00:55:19,770 --> 00:55:23,670
and find all those people that got
fucked up and give them ecstasy and see

1031
00:55:23,671 --> 00:55:25,830
if it helps.
Because there's so many people that got

1032
00:55:25,890 --> 00:55:28,800
punted in the head and thrown off a
fucking building.

1033
00:55:31,050 --> 00:55:34,590
We have the Zendo project.
Is that for Worldstar hip hop.com

1034
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:39,680
exclusively for electronic dance music
festivals and burning man.

1035
00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:42,000
I'm done.
Definitely different.

1036
00:55:42,030 --> 00:55:43,290
Definitely different.
Yeah.

1037
00:55:43,950 --> 00:55:48,950
But I mean the idea of being able to
better process trauma is universally

1038
00:55:49,411 --> 00:55:51,600
appealing.
I think all of us have had bad moments

1039
00:55:51,601 --> 00:55:54,920
in our life that probably overcome.
And you,

1040
00:55:54,950 --> 00:55:57,180
you know,
you probably have some character because

1041
00:55:57,181 --> 00:55:59,520
of those moments,
but it would be nice if you had a full

1042
00:55:59,521 --> 00:56:02,850
handle on how it makes you feel.
Yeah.

1043
00:56:03,090 --> 00:56:03,660
Yeah.
And,

1044
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:07,080
and that's where this memory enhancement
comes in handy because then you can

1045
00:56:07,110 --> 00:56:12,110
really learn from what happened.
Can I ask you how you chose Mtma out of

1046
00:56:12,211 --> 00:56:14,400
all the different psychoactive
substances?

1047
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:16,120
Yes.
Um,

1048
00:56:17,610 --> 00:56:22,320
I felt that MTMA had a chance of being

1049
00:56:24,580 --> 00:56:29,580
welcomed into the culture as the first
of the different psychedelics because it

1050
00:56:30,311 --> 00:56:33,640
has that fear reducing.
It's not so psychedelic.

1051
00:56:33,641 --> 00:56:35,650
It's not a classic psychedelics.
Yeah.

1052
00:56:35,860 --> 00:56:38,500
It,
it doesn't make you feel like you're

1053
00:56:38,501 --> 00:56:43,330
losing control.
It makes it so that you feel a subtle

1054
00:56:43,331 --> 00:56:48,331
shift of openness to self acceptance and
self love and self acceptance I think is

1055
00:56:53,020 --> 00:56:56,680
like the core of it,
and your muscles relax.

1056
00:56:57,130 --> 00:57:02,130
People can stretch a couple inches more
really when are more limber on Mtma.

1057
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:03,760
No kidding.
Yeah,

1058
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:04,631
yeah.
Have you,

1059
00:57:04,631 --> 00:57:06,660
have they ever done that with athletes?
Um,

1060
00:57:06,940 --> 00:57:09,360
I don't know.
They should do it with athletes like

1061
00:57:09,370 --> 00:57:12,180
people that are already really flexible,
like maybe jazz or something like,

1062
00:57:12,210 --> 00:57:14,860
and that's the Yoga people and I've done
martial arts people.

1063
00:57:14,890 --> 00:57:16,360
Yeah,
you can do.

1064
00:57:16,450 --> 00:57:21,450
I think that's part of the muscles relax
and that part of your attention is,

1065
00:57:22,070 --> 00:57:27,070
or it's tense because of parts of your
brain and so that the way in which you

1066
00:57:27,821 --> 00:57:32,821
can then have this full memory when
you're feeling peaceful and you're

1067
00:57:33,671 --> 00:57:36,880
looking at it as if it's happened in the
past,

1068
00:57:36,881 --> 00:57:37,480
which it did.

1069
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:42,070
So you finally got this perspective on
it because this piece makes it so that

1070
00:57:42,071 --> 00:57:44,080
you're.
You're not seeing it as happening right

1071
00:57:44,081 --> 00:57:47,740
now because you realize it's not
happening right now.

1072
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:52,110
It happened then.
And so you're creating this longer,

1073
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:56,740
different kinds of memory storage of
something that was clearly in the past

1074
00:57:57,070 --> 00:57:59,680
and it's connected now to this
reflective,

1075
00:57:59,681 --> 00:58:03,130
peaceful tone.
So when the memory has reconsolidated

1076
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:07,630
restored,
the next time you call it,

1077
00:58:07,631 --> 00:58:10,840
you'd get the incident,
but you get the emotional tone of this

1078
00:58:10,841 --> 00:58:15,841
peacefulness and that it's in the past.
And so you can do work within a period

1079
00:58:16,691 --> 00:58:20,230
of minutes,
sometimes hours of seeing a shift,

1080
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:23,440
um,
and looking at something differently and

1081
00:58:23,441 --> 00:58:28,441
processing these traumatic memories.
It's rare,

1082
00:58:28,571 --> 00:58:33,130
but one person was in our study and he
dropped out after just one session

1083
00:58:33,450 --> 00:58:38,450
because like I got this is like
part of what he got.

1084
00:58:39,540 --> 00:58:42,280
Tony macy is his name,
was one of the vets.

1085
00:58:42,281 --> 00:58:47,281
And part of what he got was that he had
been telling himself that he was on

1086
00:58:47,770 --> 00:58:50,530
opiates for pain,
for injuries,

1087
00:58:50,590 --> 00:58:55,590
but that he was starting to realize it
was really more of a escapism and that

1088
00:58:56,380 --> 00:59:01,380
he didn't need them and he didn't need
drugs and he didn't need Mtma or wow.

1089
00:59:02,750 --> 00:59:04,390
He didn't need anymore.
And he,

1090
00:59:04,391 --> 00:59:07,480
he'd had what he needed and will.
Kudos.

1091
00:59:07,570 --> 00:59:09,490
Yeah.
And we asked them later if,

1092
00:59:09,491 --> 00:59:10,750
um,
if,

1093
00:59:10,910 --> 00:59:15,520
if he would at least be part of our
followup evaluations,

1094
00:59:15,970 --> 00:59:17,350
and he said yes to that,
well,

1095
00:59:17,351 --> 00:59:20,430
that's nice of him.
And so he didn't have a,

1096
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:22,040
it wouldn't qualify ptsd at

1097
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:24,800
the two month.
And then when it got closer to like the

1098
00:59:24,801 --> 00:59:26,390
one year,
which is our last follow up,

1099
00:59:26,391 --> 00:59:28,340
he started saying,
well,

1100
00:59:28,341 --> 00:59:29,780
you know,
I'm still feeling pretty okay,

1101
00:59:29,781 --> 00:59:32,030
but I think I could learn more from md,
may,

1102
00:59:32,031 --> 00:59:34,580
maybe can I have now some more of these
sessions.

1103
00:59:35,510 --> 00:59:36,290
And we said,
well,

1104
00:59:36,290 --> 00:59:38,750
it's a rigid protocol you've dropped
out.

1105
00:59:39,220 --> 00:59:42,230
Um,
but let's just wait and see if you even

1106
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:44,780
would qualify to be in the study if you
even have ptsd.

1107
00:59:44,781 --> 00:59:47,480
So we did the 12 month followup and he
didn't have,

1108
00:59:47,690 --> 00:59:50,780
he wouldn't even qualify to be and still
wanted to give some exit off you because

1109
00:59:50,781 --> 00:59:55,781
there's other things to learn how good
it feels to me.

1110
00:59:56,900 --> 01:00:00,200
Trying to party party under the auspice
of scientific study.

1111
01:00:00,230 --> 01:00:03,020
And,
and in order to be the most rigorous

1112
01:00:03,021 --> 01:00:05,210
too,
there's a way to look at studies.

1113
01:00:05,211 --> 01:00:07,430
One is called the per protocol.

1114
01:00:07,460 --> 01:00:11,030
Everybody that finishes the study and
meets the criteria and the other is

1115
01:00:11,031 --> 01:00:14,570
called intent to treat,
so that means everybody that comes,

1116
01:00:14,571 --> 01:00:18,200
you got to look at their data.
Even if they drop out or they lied to

1117
01:00:18,201 --> 01:00:22,160
get into the study or they wouldn't have
qualified or whatever it is.

1118
01:00:22,220 --> 01:00:25,790
Once you have enrolled somebody that's
the more conservative,

1119
01:00:25,791 --> 01:00:28,240
you just have to include everybody.
You can't just be picking the people

1120
01:00:28,300 --> 01:00:31,540
that fulfilled your treatment plan.
Right?

1121
01:00:31,820 --> 01:00:35,930
So this guy was a part of that.
We couldn't normally count them,

1122
01:00:35,931 --> 01:00:39,770
but now that we're doing the most
conservative intent to treat analysis,

1123
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:44,450
we can include the dropouts.
So actually Tony Scores of massive

1124
01:00:44,451 --> 01:00:49,370
reduction in ptsd symptoms after just
one session counts in our data.

1125
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:52,700
Wow.
Because he was screened and had the

1126
01:00:52,701 --> 01:00:55,220
first session.
There's so many variabilities,

1127
01:00:55,850 --> 01:01:00,380
happiness being such a crazy sort of
unquantifiable thing,

1128
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:00,740
right?

1129
01:01:00,740 --> 01:01:04,460
That's what everybody wants.
Everybody wants some happiness and one

1130
01:01:04,461 --> 01:01:08,480
of the things that Mtma does seem to
provide a lot of people is relief from

1131
01:01:08,481 --> 01:01:12,320
tension,
which in a lot of ways equals happiness.

1132
01:01:12,321 --> 01:01:12,570
I mean,
if,

1133
01:01:12,570 --> 01:01:13,850
if,
if you know universally,

1134
01:01:13,851 --> 01:01:17,360
if you had to say what is the one thing
that people get from a drug called

1135
01:01:17,390 --> 01:01:19,370
ecstasy,
it's you feel great,

1136
01:01:19,730 --> 01:01:21,110
right?
You feel relief,

1137
01:01:21,111 --> 01:01:24,200
you feel comfortable,
insecurities melt.

1138
01:01:24,260 --> 01:01:25,610
They just dissolve.
They don't,

1139
01:01:25,730 --> 01:01:29,420
they don't exist anymore and you can
approach people in this really weird

1140
01:01:29,421 --> 01:01:32,480
open way where you're not constantly
ready to judo,

1141
01:01:32,481 --> 01:01:34,790
whatever kind of bad shit they're
sending your way,

1142
01:01:34,930 --> 01:01:36,740
like so many people when they
communicate,

1143
01:01:36,741 --> 01:01:41,741
they always have some sort of a wall up
or some sort of a barrier between their

1144
01:01:43,131 --> 01:01:47,270
real feelings and what they're
projecting so that they can sort of

1145
01:01:47,271 --> 01:01:50,510
figure out how to navigate this
conversation with the least amount of

1146
01:01:50,511 --> 01:01:52,640
social damage.
You know?

1147
01:01:52,700 --> 01:01:57,700
I mean it's like this is like a zen to
some styles of communication like this

1148
01:01:59,901 --> 01:02:04,901
way of going through it with having the
least amount of conflict in your life.

1149
01:02:06,770 --> 01:02:10,650
But if everybody was on ecstasy,
that would be the vibe like this.

1150
01:02:10,730 --> 01:02:14,000
There's a vibe that you get and I'm not
saying everybody should do it or what

1151
01:02:14,001 --> 01:02:16,070
I'm saying is,
is a vibe that you get when you

1152
01:02:16,071 --> 01:02:17,310
communicating?
I accidentally,

1153
01:02:17,350 --> 01:02:19,860
it makes it almost impossible to

1154
01:02:20,130 --> 01:02:23,790
have arguments with people.
It gets weird like you communicate with

1155
01:02:23,791 --> 01:02:28,791
people in this open way that you will
never even attempt if he weren't both on

1156
01:02:29,281 --> 01:02:34,230
Mtma yeah,
we actually have a study starting in the

1157
01:02:34,230 --> 01:02:38,040
next month or so where we're going to
give to people Mtma at the same time to

1158
01:02:38,070 --> 01:02:41,910
a couple a dialogue of,
well these are already people that are

1159
01:02:41,970 --> 01:02:46,680
related,
but one of them has ptsd and one of them

1160
01:02:46,710 --> 01:02:49,830
it affects the relationship but doesn't
have ptsd.

1161
01:02:50,340 --> 01:02:51,730
And so this was,
um,

1162
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:55,030
a major,
major breakthrough because I'm,

1163
01:02:55,230 --> 01:02:59,430
the first study with psychedelics was in
the modern era was 1990 with Rick

1164
01:02:59,431 --> 01:03:01,970
strassman with a dmt study.
Uh,

1165
01:03:02,340 --> 01:03:06,690
and ever since then,
now for the past 26 years,

1166
01:03:06,691 --> 01:03:11,160
it's only been one person getting Mtma
or psilocybin or Lsd or anything at a

1167
01:03:11,161 --> 01:03:14,550
time.
So this is the first time we've been

1168
01:03:14,551 --> 01:03:17,910
able to work with two people at a time
and give them Mtma.

1169
01:03:17,940 --> 01:03:22,940
And it's also the study that's in
informal collaboration with the Veterans

1170
01:03:24,120 --> 01:03:25,770
Administration,
National Center for Ptsd.

1171
01:03:26,190 --> 01:03:30,390
It's a therapist that used to work
within the national center who's now at

1172
01:03:30,391 --> 01:03:35,391
Ryerson University in Toronto,
who develop this approach and who was

1173
01:03:35,611 --> 01:03:40,611
introduced to us through the work of
Richard Rockefeller who was opening the

1174
01:03:40,861 --> 01:03:45,270
doors for us with the National Center
for Ptsd and we met this woman,

1175
01:03:45,271 --> 01:03:47,280
candice Monson,
who's the researcher,

1176
01:03:47,670 --> 01:03:51,150
and she's developed what's called
cognitive behavioral conjoint therapy

1177
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:56,600
and conjoint means couples and so it's a
cognitive behavioral sort of scripted

1178
01:03:57,331 --> 01:04:02,070
how you kind of think about your trauma
and exercises about it,

1179
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:06,450
but it's for couples and so when they
were thinking how to blend Mtma with

1180
01:04:06,451 --> 01:04:09,690
traditional non drug psychotherapies
that are used by the va,

1181
01:04:10,620 --> 01:04:14,220
the couple's therapy they thought would
be the most logical because it helps you

1182
01:04:14,221 --> 01:04:17,850
to have those kinds of communications.
You're the better listeners.

1183
01:04:17,851 --> 01:04:19,790
You're more empathic.
Yeah.

1184
01:04:19,810 --> 01:04:24,810
You can get over stuck arguments and the
ptsd really does affect the relationship

1185
01:04:25,531 --> 01:04:30,531
and in a lot of ways and there's.
The researchers have all these measures

1186
01:04:31,531 --> 01:04:35,310
of the relationship with the style of
communication between the people.

1187
01:04:35,820 --> 01:04:40,440
We really care about the caps,
the clinician administered ptsd scale,

1188
01:04:41,220 --> 01:04:44,850
but it's going to be tremendously
exciting and we've been able to get

1189
01:04:44,851 --> 01:04:48,900
permission for the first time to give to
people MTMA and we'll be able to monitor

1190
01:04:48,901 --> 01:04:50,970
that,
but couples therapy,

1191
01:04:50,971 --> 01:04:53,360
even though it's a tremendous use of
Mgma,

1192
01:04:53,370 --> 01:04:57,750
will never make it through the FDA
because you can only take diseases.

1193
01:04:57,751 --> 01:05:01,590
You don't have to treat a disease.
It's not for personal psychotherapy,

1194
01:05:02,310 --> 01:05:04,650
which is not,
you know those things.

1195
01:05:04,820 --> 01:05:08,010
It could be anxiety disorder or ptsd or
depression.

1196
01:05:08,011 --> 01:05:12,620
We have to treat diseases.
It's such a weird distinction there.

1197
01:05:12,790 --> 01:05:15,930
If there's something wrong and you have
a substance that makes that wrong,

1198
01:05:15,931 --> 01:05:16,770
better,
why?

1199
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:18,010
Why does it have something wrong?
Have

1200
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:19,780
to be something you look at in a petri
dish.

1201
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:21,580
Well,
only because of the drug war.

1202
01:05:21,670 --> 01:05:24,640
It's only because it's illegal.
Otherwise it doesn't make any sense.

1203
01:05:24,670 --> 01:05:27,070
I mean,
it's obviously there's a condition and a

1204
01:05:27,071 --> 01:05:31,720
solution to that condition mean this is
the fact that you're not dying from

1205
01:05:31,721 --> 01:05:35,500
feeling like shit about your marriage.
It doesn't mean there's not a problem.

1206
01:05:35,790 --> 01:05:36,850
You know?
I mean,

1207
01:05:36,910 --> 01:05:38,580
that's so stupid.
Yeah,

1208
01:05:38,610 --> 01:05:43,270
it will be one of the best uses of Mtma.
I mean that's like making toothpaste

1209
01:05:43,271 --> 01:05:45,130
illegal.
It's like,

1210
01:05:45,131 --> 01:05:45,590
you know,
the,

1211
01:05:45,590 --> 01:05:50,530
unless you have like a serious dental
disorder and you really need to clean

1212
01:05:50,531 --> 01:05:54,040
the holes,
like you have some sort of a horrible

1213
01:05:54,041 --> 01:05:58,450
root canal that's about to happen.
It's the idea that you can somehow or

1214
01:05:58,451 --> 01:06:01,810
another key people from doing what they
wanna do.

1215
01:06:02,060 --> 01:06:03,820
That's at the heart of it all right.

1216
01:06:04,450 --> 01:06:05,330
Right.
And,

1217
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:08,770
and I think that the,
this idea of,

1218
01:06:09,070 --> 01:06:12,170
again,
the psychedelics because Hashtag

1219
01:06:12,171 --> 01:06:15,160
psychedelics because of coming out of
the closet of people

1220
01:06:17,290 --> 01:06:21,250
saying that that this has been helpful
and that this is something good and we

1221
01:06:21,251 --> 01:06:23,720
should be able to do this.
And um,

1222
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:29,160
I think the eventual use,
we're sort of backing into this use in

1223
01:06:29,861 --> 01:06:32,440
couples,
but it's really about making empty

1224
01:06:32,441 --> 01:06:36,940
manger medicine for Ptsd and it's also
about trying to understand what's the

1225
01:06:36,941 --> 01:06:40,420
drug and what's the,
the context.

1226
01:06:40,690 --> 01:06:45,250
So while we had this context I was
describing of this non directive therapy

1227
01:06:45,251 --> 01:06:48,760
of the unconscious being the guide,
other people like cognitive behavioral,

1228
01:06:48,761 --> 01:06:51,640
they give you all these exercises to
think about.

1229
01:06:51,641 --> 01:06:54,460
And how you think about your trauma and
we're and when it,

1230
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:58,780
your triggers are and all different
kinds of thought exercises.

1231
01:06:59,350 --> 01:07:04,300
And so we're seeing that MTMA is like a
general tool and so we're,

1232
01:07:05,380 --> 01:07:09,280
because it's nonprofit drug development,
we're trying to work with as many other

1233
01:07:09,281 --> 01:07:11,230
therapists was,
as many other,

1234
01:07:11,710 --> 01:07:13,840
uh,
combinations of treatments that they

1235
01:07:13,841 --> 01:07:16,720
want to use to explore if they want to
blend Mtma with it.

1236
01:07:17,670 --> 01:07:22,240
And so we have this 960 grams of

1237
01:07:22,590 --> 01:07:24,170
worlds.
Some of the world's purest am.

1238
01:07:24,171 --> 01:07:29,171
Don't tell me where it is
made by Dave Nichols at.

1239
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:32,150
Don't even give up the dude's name.
They're going to hold them hostage and

1240
01:07:32,151 --> 01:07:33,860
make them.
Now this was a,

1241
01:07:33,861 --> 01:07:36,530
a lady had legal permission,
legal MDM.

1242
01:07:36,531 --> 01:07:37,670
This is all legal.
What I'm saying,

1243
01:07:37,700 --> 01:07:40,340
1985.
I had a kilogram made.

1244
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:44,720
Oh my God.
And that's what does that two pounds.

1245
01:07:44,850 --> 01:07:46,880
I'm two point two pounds.
Two pounds.

1246
01:07:47,030 --> 01:07:48,800
Jesus Christ.
Yeah.

1247
01:07:49,260 --> 01:07:52,570
And googling Mowgli young Jamie.
And this.

1248
01:07:52,710 --> 01:07:57,710
This was
in the department of Medicinal chemistry

1249
01:07:59,450 --> 01:08:01,190
at purdue.
Oh my God.

1250
01:08:01,220 --> 01:08:02,570
They got a better yield than they
thought.

1251
01:08:02,571 --> 01:08:04,080
They got more than a killer doll.
Yeah,

1252
01:08:04,100 --> 01:08:05,930
but they did,
they started off with it and the whole

1253
01:08:05,931 --> 01:08:10,880
night I only paid $4,000 for it.
Did you guys ever do a rave while you're

1254
01:08:10,910 --> 01:08:12,530
making it?
Absolutely not.

1255
01:08:12,700 --> 01:08:15,530
Oh,
I'll read that you at all.

1256
01:08:15,531 --> 01:08:17,030
But way to go.

1257
01:08:17,150 --> 01:08:18,830
We just stick to the script.
Yeah,

1258
01:08:18,890 --> 01:08:19,521
no,
that was,

1259
01:08:19,521 --> 01:08:20,390
this was,
you know,

1260
01:08:20,391 --> 01:08:23,210
there's like the legal track and
understand.

1261
01:08:23,530 --> 01:08:25,580
Yeah.
That's why the yield was totally off.

1262
01:08:26,570 --> 01:08:28,490
No,
it was all right.

1263
01:08:28,491 --> 01:08:33,491
So
we have a 960 grams left 31 years later.

1264
01:08:34,361 --> 01:08:37,480
It's Christ and it's still the exact
same thing we're using in our study.

1265
01:08:37,481 --> 01:08:41,270
So 31 years later it's the,
you know,

1266
01:08:41,271 --> 01:08:44,900
it's kept in a room temperature and
without light,

1267
01:08:44,901 --> 01:08:47,780
without moisture.
It's just infuriating that it's taken

1268
01:08:47,781 --> 01:08:51,950
this long for people to recognize what
other people have said for the other

1269
01:08:51,951 --> 01:08:54,830
people said for a long time.
And I understand the idea of having

1270
01:08:54,831 --> 01:08:58,700
rigorous scientific testing,
but at a certain point in time it should

1271
01:08:58,701 --> 01:09:00,140
be,
there should be enough anecdotal

1272
01:09:00,141 --> 01:09:01,980
evidence and lack of,
for me,

1273
01:09:02,330 --> 01:09:03,960
I mean,
how many people died from Mgma?

1274
01:09:04,300 --> 01:09:05,680
Has Anybody?
Um,

1275
01:09:05,720 --> 01:09:06,890
yes.
Yeah.

1276
01:09:06,950 --> 01:09:07,783
What are the risks?

1277
01:09:07,910 --> 01:09:09,470
What is the ld 50?
Yeah,

1278
01:09:10,610 --> 01:09:15,560
well,
I'm ld 50 is a measure where you give a

1279
01:09:15,561 --> 01:09:20,561
bunch of animals increasing amounts and
the amount where you kill half of them,

1280
01:09:21,760 --> 01:09:22,960
right?
Um,

1281
01:09:23,690 --> 01:09:28,690
the ld 50 of 'em empty main humans.
Um,

1282
01:09:30,680 --> 01:09:33,270
I don't actually even know that number.
Um,

1283
01:09:33,740 --> 01:09:36,470
but it has happened.
People have people they died from it or

1284
01:09:36,471 --> 01:09:38,960
they die for.
I know people have died from dehydration

1285
01:09:39,050 --> 01:09:42,570
have died from hyperthermia.
Right?

1286
01:09:42,620 --> 01:09:45,290
So mtma affects your temperature
controls,

1287
01:09:45,890 --> 01:09:47,750
which is one reason we measure
temperature,

1288
01:09:47,751 --> 01:09:49,820
although in therapy,
but in a clinical setting,

1289
01:09:49,821 --> 01:09:52,820
line down,
there's no problem with temperature at

1290
01:09:52,821 --> 01:09:53,660
all.
Um,

1291
01:09:54,200 --> 01:09:58,130
and normally there wouldn't be either.
If there was adequate harm reduction and

1292
01:09:58,131 --> 01:10:00,110
people were drinking,
not just water,

1293
01:10:00,111 --> 01:10:02,700
but I'm electrolytes.
Um,

1294
01:10:02,750 --> 01:10:05,450
and they would take time.
People are always so sweaty is I was

1295
01:10:05,451 --> 01:10:08,380
going on there sweating,
but the dance a lot too.

1296
01:10:09,210 --> 01:10:12,650
It's that combination.
So some people have maybe glowsticks,

1297
01:10:14,360 --> 01:10:16,550
pacifier,
glitter,

1298
01:10:16,670 --> 01:10:19,970
glitter.
I know my analogy about toothpaste is a

1299
01:10:19,971 --> 01:10:22,040
bad one,
know toothpaste and teeth,

1300
01:10:22,041 --> 01:10:25,820
but there is,
there is some weirdness to this idea

1301
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:31,000
that we need a substance like gets
classified whether no matter whether

1302
01:10:32,241 --> 01:10:36,110
it's legal or illegal,
it's gets classified and when you make

1303
01:10:36,111 --> 01:10:41,111
something a drug and that drug can only
be used when there's an ailment,

1304
01:10:41,750 --> 01:10:45,140
then you lock out the whole possibility
of performance enhancing substances

1305
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:46,280
like,
well we can't.

1306
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:48,920
I mean we,
we don't disclude across the board

1307
01:10:48,921 --> 01:10:49,730
performing,
enhancing,

1308
01:10:49,730 --> 01:10:52,280
enhancing substances.
I mean that's essentially what coffee is

1309
01:10:52,470 --> 01:10:53,510
and it's mandatory.
I mean,

1310
01:10:53,511 --> 01:10:56,600
coffee breaks or written into union
bills.

1311
01:10:56,630 --> 01:10:58,910
I mean all the,
like when they make a contract,

1312
01:10:58,911 --> 01:11:01,520
they've write in coffee breaks.
We've always had coffee breaks,

1313
01:11:01,521 --> 01:11:03,720
right?
That's a break to take a drug for

1314
01:11:03,800 --> 01:11:04,340
productivity.

1315
01:11:04,340 --> 01:11:08,500
And it used to be illegal at one point
where people gathered together and talk

1316
01:11:08,510 --> 01:11:11,060
and revolution in England.
Incredible.

1317
01:11:11,300 --> 01:11:12,980
So it's like many other things.
So we,

1318
01:11:13,170 --> 01:11:15,400
this one,
performance enhancing drug will ecstasy

1319
01:11:15,401 --> 01:11:19,290
is probably a performance enhancing drug
as well because it gets rid of some of

1320
01:11:19,291 --> 01:11:21,960
the bullshit that you've got clogging up
your thinking.

1321
01:11:22,260 --> 01:11:24,180
Right?
And it allows you to think more freely.

1322
01:11:24,210 --> 01:11:25,320
Right?
And you can.

1323
01:11:25,640 --> 01:11:26,473
It's,
it's,

1324
01:11:27,210 --> 01:11:30,660
it's the most inherently therapeutic of
all the psychedelics.

1325
01:11:30,661 --> 01:11:32,700
So when you asked me why did I choose
Mtma,

1326
01:11:32,701 --> 01:11:37,020
I think one part is it is the most
inherently therapeutic.

1327
01:11:37,050 --> 01:11:41,670
People tend not to have bad trips.
That kind of bad trips people have is

1328
01:11:41,671 --> 01:11:45,960
when they take Mtma in a recreational
setting and difficult emotions come up

1329
01:11:45,961 --> 01:11:48,510
and there with friends that just want to
party and they tried to stuff the

1330
01:11:48,511 --> 01:11:53,250
emotions down and someone plays slayer
and real loud or that would be worse

1331
01:11:53,251 --> 01:11:54,084
too.

1332
01:11:54,310 --> 01:11:59,130
And then they end up worse off.
So MTMA can make people worse off toe.

1333
01:11:59,370 --> 01:12:03,210
Well there's certain people that really
shouldn't be allowed to chew gum and we

1334
01:12:03,211 --> 01:12:06,090
should take them into account too.
There's certain people that are going to

1335
01:12:06,091 --> 01:12:09,480
stub their toe every time they walk.
And I don't think we should know if the

1336
01:12:09,481 --> 01:12:12,840
world okay.
It's super important to recognize when

1337
01:12:12,841 --> 01:12:15,900
you're looking at all these numbers and
statistics that there is a certain

1338
01:12:15,901 --> 01:12:19,410
percentage of these people in this world
that are helpless.

1339
01:12:19,680 --> 01:12:23,490
You just can't do anything about them.
There is everything,

1340
01:12:23,491 --> 01:12:25,050
if you look at,
I'm skiing,

1341
01:12:25,051 --> 01:12:27,480
look at the number of people that die
running into trees.

1342
01:12:27,870 --> 01:12:30,120
I mean,
every year there's about 35 or 40 people

1343
01:12:30,121 --> 01:12:31,410
that die skiing.
Every year.

1344
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:32,490
Two,
we lost Sonny Bono.

1345
01:12:32,491 --> 01:12:34,230
You'd have to remind me.
Yeah,

1346
01:12:34,520 --> 01:12:36,210
I have to bring it up,
throw salt.

1347
01:12:36,430 --> 01:12:38,970
And that's not even counting people with
avalanches.

1348
01:12:39,190 --> 01:12:42,180
But,
but that's because there are benefits

1349
01:12:42,330 --> 01:12:43,860
and that's where again,
this coming out,

1350
01:12:43,890 --> 01:12:45,560
it's fun schemes.
Fun but the,

1351
01:12:45,561 --> 01:12:47,100
you know,
so it was driving race cars.

1352
01:12:47,130 --> 01:12:49,920
That's fun too.
If there's a lot of stuff that's fun but

1353
01:12:50,700 --> 01:12:51,690
dangerous.
Look,

1354
01:12:51,691 --> 01:12:54,210
there's a lot of dangerous activities,
but the amount of people that actually

1355
01:12:54,211 --> 01:12:58,340
die from ecstasy versus skiing,
very low and very.

1356
01:12:58,870 --> 01:13:02,880
A lot of people take who skis ski more,
take ecstasy more.

1357
01:13:03,900 --> 01:13:07,440
Um,
I think that a lot of what people think

1358
01:13:07,441 --> 01:13:10,320
is ecstasy is exiting.
Meaning Mtma is really something else.

1359
01:13:10,350 --> 01:13:12,810
So that's another problem is right
around the half of it.

1360
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:14,580
I'm like math,
right?

1361
01:13:14,581 --> 01:13:19,050
With erowid.org,
there's an ecstasy pill testing program

1362
01:13:19,230 --> 01:13:22,200
that they have been conducting that we
helped start years ago.

1363
01:13:22,710 --> 01:13:25,830
People,
there's one licensed laboratory licensed

1364
01:13:25,831 --> 01:13:28,930
by the dea and the United States that
can take anonymous samples of drugs.

1365
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:33,060
You can get drugs tested,
and so there's been this program to get

1366
01:13:33,780 --> 01:13:34,200
ecstasy.

1367
01:13:34,200 --> 01:13:39,200
Pills tested over eight or $900 have
already been tested and around half of

1368
01:13:39,271 --> 01:13:41,850
them don't even have mtma in them.
Jesus Christ.

1369
01:13:41,851 --> 01:13:46,851
So there's they mostly amphetamines.
They're fed means their caffeine.

1370
01:13:47,350 --> 01:13:49,380
A lot of pain pills.
Yeah.

1371
01:13:49,390 --> 01:13:51,690
They're selling them as excess.
Sometimes they would,

1372
01:13:51,691 --> 01:13:54,030
um,
there there's test kits that dance safe

1373
01:13:54,031 --> 01:13:55,810
cells and sometimes,
um,

1374
01:13:55,890 --> 01:13:59,470
to pool the test kits which turns a
certain color if there's Mtma in it.

1375
01:13:59,500 --> 01:14:01,740
There's been pills that are one part
mtma nine parts.

1376
01:14:01,770 --> 01:14:02,860
Caffeine.
Wow.

1377
01:14:03,750 --> 01:14:07,050
Because there is the stimulant aspect
and people stay up.

1378
01:14:07,260 --> 01:14:12,220
It's a terrible up,
but the risks of Mtma

1379
01:14:12,340 --> 01:14:15,390
even in a large recreational setting,
if,

1380
01:14:15,440 --> 01:14:20,080
if it were a post prohibition world,
those risks would be very manageable.

1381
01:14:20,140 --> 01:14:24,460
But there would be some people,
probably a rare situations,

1382
01:14:24,520 --> 01:14:28,780
somebody might die.
We have that all the time with cars,

1383
01:14:28,781 --> 01:14:29,620
with alcohol,
with,

1384
01:14:30,440 --> 01:14:32,230
you know,
I can't say that it would never happen.

1385
01:14:32,260 --> 01:14:34,030
It's like those freaks that are allergic
to shrimp,

1386
01:14:34,590 --> 01:14:37,010
right?
Or Venice Hillen people die for.

1387
01:14:37,530 --> 01:14:40,000
Yeah.
This is going to be risk for everything.

1388
01:14:40,060 --> 01:14:42,160
There's nothing that's safe.
100 percent.

1389
01:14:42,190 --> 01:14:45,650
Even salt.
Salt kills people who die from salt over

1390
01:14:45,651 --> 01:14:46,990
doses every year.
Right?

1391
01:14:47,390 --> 01:14:49,000
Aspirin.
Aspirin kills people.

1392
01:14:49,560 --> 01:14:51,730
Yeah.
Some thousands of people die every year.

1393
01:14:52,380 --> 01:14:54,340
But the actual.
Yeah,

1394
01:14:54,380 --> 01:14:55,230
it's,
yeah,

1395
01:14:55,260 --> 01:14:59,290
it's crazy.
The number of people that fall in their

1396
01:14:59,291 --> 01:15:03,490
bathtub and day and to foods get rid of
bathtubs to make them all out of rubber.

1397
01:15:04,100 --> 01:15:06,250
And so one of the things that,
um,

1398
01:15:07,750 --> 01:15:09,580
my wife said about me when,
uh,

1399
01:15:10,290 --> 01:15:13,790
some of the neighborhood teenagers when
we had our teenagers were thinking of

1400
01:15:15,220 --> 01:15:17,650
coming to visit me at boom festival in
Europe,

1401
01:15:17,680 --> 01:15:21,040
which is one of these festivals where
they have the most harm reduction.

1402
01:15:21,410 --> 01:15:23,620
Um,
and these were teenage boys.

1403
01:15:23,621 --> 01:15:26,890
And what my wife said about me was that
I wasn't really good at prevention,

1404
01:15:26,891 --> 01:15:29,070
but I was good at rescue.
Mm.

1405
01:15:29,290 --> 01:15:32,590
And so that's for me,
the prohibition versus public health,

1406
01:15:33,150 --> 01:15:34,680
you know,
prevention,

1407
01:15:34,690 --> 01:15:35,750
public,
you know,

1408
01:15:35,890 --> 01:15:38,680
prohibition.
But if we can be good at acknowledging

1409
01:15:38,681 --> 01:15:40,900
the risks,
but being prepared for them the same way

1410
01:15:40,901 --> 01:15:44,050
that festivals have medical tents and
people have all sorts of physical

1411
01:15:44,051 --> 01:15:46,930
problems,
but the problem is there's not a strict

1412
01:15:46,931 --> 01:15:51,670
prohibition on dangerous things.
So the precedents already been set of a

1413
01:15:51,730 --> 01:15:53,710
freedom.
That precedent of freedom.

1414
01:15:53,711 --> 01:15:55,540
We would like to extend across the
board.

1415
01:15:55,750 --> 01:15:57,010
We.
That's what we want.

1416
01:15:57,250 --> 01:15:59,680
We don't.
You can't tell me that I can go to a bar

1417
01:15:59,681 --> 01:16:04,681
and drink my fucking lungs out and smoke
cigarettes all day long and I can take

1418
01:16:05,471 --> 01:16:07,510
pain pills and I can do all these
things,

1419
01:16:07,511 --> 01:16:08,710
but I can't have a joint.

1420
01:16:08,740 --> 01:16:10,150
You can't.
You can't tell me that.

1421
01:16:10,151 --> 01:16:12,880
It doesn't make any sense.
Did you see the quote that was recently

1422
01:16:12,881 --> 01:16:16,480
circulated on the Internet by Erlick men
about the origins of the drug war?

1423
01:16:16,780 --> 01:16:21,400
I did see that repeated well what
basically he said that Nixon,

1424
01:16:21,610 --> 01:16:25,600
when they were looking at the protests
that were being conducted by the hippies

1425
01:16:25,630 --> 01:16:28,510
against the war,
against a lot of Nixon policies and the

1426
01:16:28,511 --> 01:16:33,300
blacks who are arguing for civil rights,
that they knew they could not make it

1427
01:16:33,370 --> 01:16:35,740
illegal to be black or illegal to be a
Hippie,

1428
01:16:35,741 --> 01:16:39,400
but they could look at the drugs that
those groups were using and selectively

1429
01:16:39,401 --> 01:16:43,510
criminalized and prosecute them and use
them to break up those communities and

1430
01:16:43,511 --> 01:16:47,440
that they knew they were exaggerating
the science and that the drug war was a

1431
01:16:47,441 --> 01:16:52,030
political war against certain kinds of
drug users who were considered to be a

1432
01:16:52,031 --> 01:16:55,320
problem to Nixon and Ehrlichman and this
was something that they will come and

1433
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:57,520
said,
I'm 20 years ago.

1434
01:16:57,521 --> 01:17:00,610
It didn't get that much attention and
he's been dead I think 10 years now,

1435
01:17:00,611 --> 01:17:03,700
but it just came out again in an article
and people are looking at what

1436
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:07,120
Ehrlichman said and it seems intuitively
true.

1437
01:17:07,480 --> 01:17:10,280
Intuitively true in just unbelievable
how damaging

1438
01:17:10,280 --> 01:17:12,740
and for how long.
I mean,

1439
01:17:12,770 --> 01:17:16,010
it's been going on since 1970,
so we're,

1440
01:17:16,011 --> 01:17:17,360
we're deep here.
Yeah,

1441
01:17:17,361 --> 01:17:22,361
but it also had triggered into a fear of
the unconscious of fear,

1442
01:17:22,790 --> 01:17:25,280
the drugs,
not just these political parts,

1443
01:17:25,281 --> 01:17:28,820
but just the drugs themselves and the
reasons why they were political with

1444
01:17:28,821 --> 01:17:33,710
also the blanket label of drugs becomes
really problematic because you have all

1445
01:17:33,711 --> 01:17:37,280
these things lumped in together.
You've got heroin and marijuana in the

1446
01:17:37,281 --> 01:17:40,670
same categories.
You've got cocaine and all these things

1447
01:17:40,671 --> 01:17:43,760
that are so different and to call them
all drugs,

1448
01:17:44,070 --> 01:17:44,770
it,
it,

1449
01:17:44,770 --> 01:17:45,340
it's,
it's,

1450
01:17:45,340 --> 01:17:48,410
it's not a good implication.
It doesn't make sense.

1451
01:17:48,411 --> 01:17:51,740
It's not a good distinction.
Like there should be obvious

1452
01:17:51,741 --> 01:17:53,600
classifications like we all know,
like I say,

1453
01:17:53,620 --> 01:17:54,830
you,
you asked me about,

1454
01:17:54,900 --> 01:17:56,900
uh,
you were telling me about the ecstasy

1455
01:17:56,901 --> 01:18:00,170
and I immediately thought amphetamines.
Well that's a category and that's how we

1456
01:18:00,171 --> 01:18:01,010
should describe them.

1457
01:18:01,400 --> 01:18:03,170
I don't think describing things,
oh,

1458
01:18:03,171 --> 01:18:04,630
you do drugs,
you know,

1459
01:18:04,640 --> 01:18:05,780
like this.
That's a dumb.

1460
01:18:05,781 --> 01:18:06,140
Well,
yeah,

1461
01:18:06,140 --> 01:18:07,940
of course I do.
What am I stupid.

1462
01:18:08,150 --> 01:18:11,270
They figured out how to do things that
are way better than not having them.

1463
01:18:11,590 --> 01:18:13,970
And there's plenty of drugs that are
excellent,

1464
01:18:13,971 --> 01:18:16,880
like the idea that you're going to be
completely drug free is dumb.

1465
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:20,120
Our brains are a drug factory.
Yeah.

1466
01:18:20,760 --> 01:18:24,590
I don't do damaging drugs.
Don't do terrible drugs,

1467
01:18:24,591 --> 01:18:26,720
don't do meth,
don't do things that are going to fuck

1468
01:18:26,721 --> 01:18:27,381
you up.
Yeah.

1469
01:18:27,381 --> 01:18:28,071
Don't do the.
Yeah,

1470
01:18:28,071 --> 01:18:31,520
there's probably some stuff you should
avoid just because it's not healthy for

1471
01:18:31,521 --> 01:18:33,860
you.
But the problem is labeling them all

1472
01:18:33,861 --> 01:18:35,600
drugs.
It depends on the dose.

1473
01:18:35,601 --> 01:18:37,880
It depends on the context.
So that one of the,

1474
01:18:38,060 --> 01:18:43,060
the FDA made their reputation in the
early sixties on blocking thalidomide to

1475
01:18:44,451 --> 01:18:47,960
be prescribed in America for morning
sickness for pregnant women because it

1476
01:18:47,961 --> 01:18:49,580
caused all these solidimide babies.

1477
01:18:50,120 --> 01:18:53,090
Um,
and it was,

1478
01:18:53,220 --> 01:18:57,470
I'm skeptical woman who ended up winning
the president's Medal of honor,

1479
01:18:57,471 --> 01:19:01,490
the only person from the FDA for
blocking this drug to linemite.

1480
01:19:01,910 --> 01:19:06,410
It was the epitome of the bad drug.
But now it's used in the treatment of

1481
01:19:06,411 --> 01:19:08,840
cancer.
It's an approved medication.

1482
01:19:08,841 --> 01:19:11,140
Thalidomide is an approved.
Let medications.

1483
01:19:11,141 --> 01:19:13,920
They just one of those medications that
only affects a certain pages,

1484
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:18,140
certain blood vessels.
And it can be useful in certain ways are

1485
01:19:18,440 --> 01:19:20,110
terrible.
So it,

1486
01:19:20,450 --> 01:19:22,370
you know,
it's not that there's good and bad

1487
01:19:22,371 --> 01:19:24,500
drugs,
it's not that things are good or bad in

1488
01:19:24,501 --> 01:19:26,600
themselves.
Like I don't think methamphetamine is a

1489
01:19:26,601 --> 01:19:28,260
bad,
you know,

1490
01:19:28,440 --> 01:19:30,170
there's mass for that.
Do you ever do it?

1491
01:19:30,980 --> 01:19:32,510
I've tried it.
What's it like?

1492
01:19:33,670 --> 01:19:38,670
Um,
I like tried it one time.

1493
01:19:39,401 --> 01:19:43,820
You cleaned your house,
should have that kind of energetic.

1494
01:19:43,821 --> 01:19:45,940
Um,
you know,

1495
01:19:45,950 --> 01:19:48,830
it wasn't that it was similar to
cocaine.

1496
01:19:49,170 --> 01:19:53,000
Um,
it was a stimulant that

1497
01:19:56,150 --> 01:19:58,100
can be really useful.
My father,

1498
01:19:58,101 --> 01:20:00,410
this was a shocking thing.
My father was a doctor,

1499
01:20:00,411 --> 01:20:04,610
a pediatrician and years ago,
and he's retired now,

1500
01:20:04,611 --> 01:20:05,444
but he,
he,

1501
01:20:05,960 --> 01:20:08,340
well after I was into doing psychedelics

1502
01:20:08,340 --> 01:20:10,200
and it dropped out with,
this was what I was focusing on.

1503
01:20:10,201 --> 01:20:12,530
He shared with me that he and his,
uh,

1504
01:20:12,630 --> 01:20:16,650
medical friends did math because they
were under these ridiculous residencies

1505
01:20:16,651 --> 01:20:18,570
and they had to work for these really
long hours.

1506
01:20:18,660 --> 01:20:20,760
Wow.
And that in the fifties it was very

1507
01:20:20,761 --> 01:20:24,120
common for residents,
medical doctors with all sorts of

1508
01:20:24,121 --> 01:20:24,610
people,
zoo,

1509
01:20:24,610 --> 01:20:26,870
methamphetamine to,
and,

1510
01:20:26,930 --> 01:20:29,940
and it's,
it was a major tool used in the war and

1511
01:20:29,941 --> 01:20:34,340
with the soldiers and it's um,
you know,

1512
01:20:34,590 --> 01:20:37,380
it doesn't have this,
um,

1513
01:20:38,370 --> 01:20:41,190
brain,
it doesn't have this evolutionary feel

1514
01:20:41,310 --> 01:20:42,830
in a way.
It helps you do,

1515
01:20:42,900 --> 01:20:45,300
you're doing,
but there's a way where psychedelics

1516
01:20:45,301 --> 01:20:50,040
help you refine what you're doing.
And so it just gives you energy.

1517
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:52,440
Does it give you food?
There's a mood to.

1518
01:20:52,550 --> 01:20:53,750
Yeah,
yeah,

1519
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:54,600
yeah.
There's.

1520
01:20:54,780 --> 01:20:58,200
So mtma is methylenedioxy
methamphetamine,

1521
01:20:58,590 --> 01:21:03,590
so there is a similar molecular change
with other additions to it,

1522
01:21:04,501 --> 01:21:06,840
which fundamentally changed how it
happens,

1523
01:21:06,900 --> 01:21:10,800
what it does in the brain.
So that's a part of maybe what triggers

1524
01:21:10,801 --> 01:21:14,580
the euphoria as well as the dopamine
release.

1525
01:21:14,610 --> 01:21:16,590
Yeah.
That is so that,

1526
01:21:16,650 --> 01:21:19,950
that chemically,
that the army in 1952,

1527
01:21:20,010 --> 01:21:22,800
the chemical warfare and people,
they were looking for mind control

1528
01:21:22,801 --> 01:21:25,500
drugs.
And so they did a study with animal

1529
01:21:25,501 --> 01:21:28,290
toxicity studies looking for ld
[inaudible] and others with eight

1530
01:21:28,291 --> 01:21:33,291
different drugs in a range.
One of them was Mtma and one was,

1531
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,630
it was like meth amphetamine to
masculine.

1532
01:21:38,830 --> 01:21:43,830
So mtma is kind of like I'm masculine in
a sense that it has that which is from

1533
01:21:46,171 --> 01:21:48,750
pod,
which has this psychedelic,

1534
01:21:49,180 --> 01:21:52,110
um,
ego dissolving and

1535
01:21:54,680 --> 01:21:59,680
things emerging and nonverbal processing
and emotional intensity that it has that

1536
01:22:00,031 --> 01:22:04,860
from masculine,
but it's not that eco desolving it's

1537
01:22:04,861 --> 01:22:09,861
more you're calmer and that has the
energy from methamphetamine but not in a

1538
01:22:10,711 --> 01:22:12,840
jittery way because you can sit still,
you can meditate,

1539
01:22:12,841 --> 01:22:14,360
meditators are now,
you know,

1540
01:22:14,570 --> 01:22:18,810
some of them have learned from Mtma or
Psilocybin to tip in a meditative

1541
01:22:18,811 --> 01:22:22,570
practice.
So you can use these in any number of,

1542
01:22:22,680 --> 01:22:26,550
of different ways.
And so you kind of have this paradoxical

1543
01:22:27,120 --> 01:22:31,680
combination of methamphetamine and
masculine that produced the molecule.

1544
01:22:31,681 --> 01:22:33,750
It does something different but
reminiscent.

1545
01:22:34,650 --> 01:22:39,650
And it is something that I believe that
will be used in initially highly

1546
01:22:41,731 --> 01:22:46,560
controlled therapeutic settings for
particular clinical indications.

1547
01:22:46,620 --> 01:22:48,800
And over time,
and by overtime,

1548
01:22:49,170 --> 01:22:53,120
I mean I'm 10 or 20 years,
there would be a,

1549
01:22:53,390 --> 01:22:56,940
uh,
a development of psychedelic clinics

1550
01:22:56,970 --> 01:22:58,260
like hospice centers.

1551
01:22:58,350 --> 01:23:00,840
Hospice centers spread all over America
in 30 years.

1552
01:23:00,900 --> 01:23:03,750
The first one was 1974,
2004.

1553
01:23:03,751 --> 01:23:08,751
There was 3,500,
so a place to help people who are at the

1554
01:23:08,861 --> 01:23:11,800
end of life,
so these are psychedelic treatment

1555
01:23:11,801 --> 01:23:16,670
centers to help people do ego death or
to to tie to their old selves or to see

1556
01:23:16,671 --> 01:23:21,671
more or that these centers will be
developed all over America.

1557
01:23:22,750 --> 01:23:27,670
I think over a process of once the drugs
are approved and probably Mtma and

1558
01:23:27,671 --> 01:23:30,610
silicide and we'll both be approved
around the same time.

1559
01:23:31,350 --> 01:23:33,480
I'm one of the other,
you know,

1560
01:23:33,490 --> 01:23:37,090
in 20,
21 is our current predictions and then

1561
01:23:37,091 --> 01:23:40,060
we'll start elaborating these clinics
and then people will get more and more

1562
01:23:40,061 --> 01:23:44,290
comfortable to it so that a
medicalization proceeds legalization and

1563
01:23:44,291 --> 01:23:47,260
that's what we've seen with medical
marijuana that the culture gets

1564
01:23:47,261 --> 01:23:52,261
comfortable through this process of I'm
now research and use that they can trust

1565
01:23:55,481 --> 01:23:59,110
that they see directly and they see
distribution centers that aren't violent

1566
01:23:59,111 --> 01:24:03,940
and people see a system and they then
are now.

1567
01:24:03,970 --> 01:24:05,890
Now it's.
The latest poll was 60 percent of

1568
01:24:05,891 --> 01:24:09,820
Americans in favor Americans in favor of
marijuana legalization.

1569
01:24:10,330 --> 01:24:12,240
Wow.
Highest it's ever been.

1570
01:24:12,370 --> 01:24:14,410
That's incredible.
Yeah,

1571
01:24:14,440 --> 01:24:17,170
so that,
I think that it's,

1572
01:24:17,710 --> 01:24:20,380
I think that we need,
people are under so much stress and if

1573
01:24:20,381 --> 01:24:23,350
you look around at the world,
the world is under so much stress and

1574
01:24:23,351 --> 01:24:27,100
the environment is under stress and the
cultures are bumping up against each

1575
01:24:27,101 --> 01:24:28,990
other,
that we need to have all the tools

1576
01:24:29,380 --> 01:24:33,230
available to manage the stress because
it's a,

1577
01:24:33,340 --> 01:24:38,340
it's a tremendously crucial time in
human history where we have these

1578
01:24:39,970 --> 01:24:43,810
capabilities through our technology that
we never have for impact.

1579
01:24:43,930 --> 01:24:47,320
Planetary Systems went away.
These psychedelic drugs that are kind of

1580
01:24:47,370 --> 01:24:49,630
technology as well.
There are technology to get us to

1581
01:24:49,631 --> 01:24:52,090
understand how our brains functioning.
Yes.

1582
01:24:52,091 --> 01:24:53,110
And there's,
there's this,

1583
01:24:53,111 --> 01:24:56,530
um,
a confluence of coincidence,

1584
01:24:56,531 --> 01:24:58,540
of timing that the,
um,

1585
01:24:58,810 --> 01:25:03,580
Albert Hoffman who invented lsd first
upgraded and 38 and then accidentally

1586
01:25:03,581 --> 01:25:08,050
ingested it in 43,
felt that the development of nuclear

1587
01:25:08,440 --> 01:25:13,440
splitting of the atom was occurring
contemporaneously with this discovery of

1588
01:25:15,220 --> 01:25:16,053
LSD.

1589
01:25:16,330 --> 01:25:18,040
And,
and in his view,

1590
01:25:18,041 --> 01:25:22,690
there was this kind of outer technology
and this inner technology.

1591
01:25:22,750 --> 01:25:27,130
And that Einstein said the splitting of
the atom has changed everything except

1592
01:25:27,131 --> 01:25:29,410
our motive thinking.
And hence we drift towards unparalleled

1593
01:25:29,411 --> 01:25:33,400
could astrophe what shall be required as
a substantially new mode of thinking.

1594
01:25:34,330 --> 01:25:35,950
And Albert Hoffman was like,
well,

1595
01:25:36,730 --> 01:25:38,720
I do wonder about the,
um,

1596
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:43,360
the technology,
which many people think that if it comes

1597
01:25:43,361 --> 01:25:44,890
from nature,
it's really good.

1598
01:25:45,340 --> 01:25:47,320
You know,
they're there if it's plant medicine,

1599
01:25:47,380 --> 01:25:49,780
but if it comes from a lab at somehow
suspect.

1600
01:25:50,290 --> 01:25:53,830
But I think that it comes from our mind.
We're from nature labs,

1601
01:25:54,310 --> 01:25:58,120
so lsd nature of these plants,
they just extract the chemicals from

1602
01:25:58,121 --> 01:25:59,740
these plants.
When you break it down to what the

1603
01:25:59,741 --> 01:26:01,960
chemicals are,
you can reproduce those in the lab.

1604
01:26:02,350 --> 01:26:03,560
It's not as,
as.

1605
01:26:03,590 --> 01:26:04,070
It's not

1606
01:26:04,070 --> 01:26:06,350
natural.
It's exactly the same thing as natural.

1607
01:26:07,140 --> 01:26:08,150
It's all natural,
right?

1608
01:26:08,151 --> 01:26:10,580
Because it's all from something that's
on earth.

1609
01:26:10,880 --> 01:26:13,580
Well actually,
because we're trying to see,

1610
01:26:14,230 --> 01:26:17,390
you know,
how we're operating in the public

1611
01:26:17,391 --> 01:26:19,820
benefit manner and fair trade and all
this.

1612
01:26:19,821 --> 01:26:22,670
I asked the company that's now making us
are a kilogram of.

1613
01:26:22,880 --> 01:26:27,170
We're having a new kilogram of Mtma made
and if you need more.

1614
01:26:27,171 --> 01:26:30,260
I thought you said you had a gang of it.
We have 960 grams,

1615
01:26:30,261 --> 01:26:33,020
but it's,
it's not gmp medical.

1616
01:26:33,080 --> 01:26:35,840
It's not acceptable for phase three
research.

1617
01:26:35,900 --> 01:26:37,100
Oh yeah.
I would say that.

1618
01:26:37,101 --> 01:26:40,580
Something like that.
So I would say went bad.

1619
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:42,440
We got to keep it away.
The kids.

1620
01:26:44,030 --> 01:26:46,090
Well we do.
We want to give it away to researchers.

1621
01:26:46,091 --> 01:26:47,870
So if there are researchers that are
listening,

1622
01:26:48,140 --> 01:26:51,800
we have free
time researching.

1623
01:26:52,100 --> 01:26:54,410
We would search for you too.
We would like to give it there,

1624
01:26:54,411 --> 01:26:56,890
but the uh,
mostly crocodile attacks.

1625
01:26:56,890 --> 01:27:00,410
But I'll fuck around with some ideas
about the current.

1626
01:27:00,590 --> 01:27:02,850
Alaina is costing us,
um,

1627
01:27:03,550 --> 01:27:07,320
to have the medical grade is now costing
us $400,000.

1628
01:27:07,340 --> 01:27:08,330
Zero.
Of course we need that.

1629
01:27:08,780 --> 01:27:11,060
We need that medical grade and that's
what our event.

1630
01:27:11,150 --> 01:27:13,010
You got to like a bucket of this stuff
laying around.

1631
01:27:13,300 --> 01:27:14,450
Well,
but it's not,

1632
01:27:14,710 --> 01:27:17,060
you know,
that's where we're making this

1633
01:27:17,061 --> 01:27:18,000
transition.
Yes.

1634
01:27:18,050 --> 01:27:23,050
Into the higher regulated areas.
So it is just that the standards of

1635
01:27:23,150 --> 01:27:25,610
procurement weren't as strict.
Is that?

1636
01:27:25,730 --> 01:27:26,880
Yes.
That the,

1637
01:27:26,930 --> 01:27:30,190
that the symphony may just as pure as
the,

1638
01:27:30,210 --> 01:27:31,650
what we're going to get,
by the way,

1639
01:27:31,820 --> 01:27:34,640
never used the word procurement.
One of those words that are used in the

1640
01:27:34,670 --> 01:27:37,790
smoothness of the right word is that
okay could use right there.

1641
01:27:38,840 --> 01:27:41,390
It's the pedigree of all the
ingredients,

1642
01:27:41,510 --> 01:27:45,140
so there has to be a paper trail for the
ingredients and so you don't have that

1643
01:27:45,141 --> 01:27:45,350
right now.

1644
01:27:45,350 --> 01:27:47,930
You've got your shift from a dealer.
We sort of.

1645
01:27:48,020 --> 01:27:51,530
One of the things that he didn't have
all of the paperwork.

1646
01:27:51,760 --> 01:27:52,730
Oh,
it's like a car.

1647
01:27:52,760 --> 01:27:57,410
Apparently there's a part of the process
of making mtma where you need aluminum

1648
01:27:58,010 --> 01:28:03,010
and took some aluminum.
Jesus Christ with Rowan forks in there

1649
01:28:03,330 --> 01:28:07,610
and he took some aluminum foil and use
that in the process.

1650
01:28:07,700 --> 01:28:08,600
Oh,
that's bad.

1651
01:28:08,660 --> 01:28:10,730
Well,
because it's not like witchy aluminum

1652
01:28:10,731 --> 01:28:13,290
foil and which batch and where did it
come from?

1653
01:28:13,291 --> 01:28:16,400
And Jesus Christ.
This guy through aluminum foil into your

1654
01:28:16,401 --> 01:28:20,870
fucking mixture.
Janky ass fucking way to make things.

1655
01:28:21,470 --> 01:28:24,770
Throw the metal in.
It seems so stupid.

1656
01:28:26,090 --> 01:28:29,470
I'm sure it was a really bad cans.
Fuck yeah,

1657
01:28:29,480 --> 01:28:30,870
dude.
I'm in it.

1658
01:28:30,900 --> 01:28:33,170
Want to roll?
We're rolling.

1659
01:28:33,320 --> 01:28:34,580
Yeah.
If I knew more chemistry,

1660
01:28:34,581 --> 01:28:37,310
I could kind of explain what it did and
in the process.

1661
01:28:37,320 --> 01:28:41,480
But aluminum is super calm,
a common rather aluminum is like a,

1662
01:28:41,630 --> 01:28:43,880
we think of aluminum as being frying
pans,

1663
01:28:44,120 --> 01:28:46,340
but that's not the,
that's not the form it takes in the

1664
01:28:46,341 --> 01:28:47,210
wild,
you know,

1665
01:28:47,220 --> 01:28:50,360
we're car panels and make a lot of cars
out of aluminum now because they figured

1666
01:28:50,361 --> 01:28:53,930
out how to make like super lightweight
but very strong aluminum.

1667
01:28:54,380 --> 01:28:58,010
That's as strong as steel but lighter.
But aluminum is everywhere.

1668
01:28:58,130 --> 01:29:00,650
It's in dirt.
Like it's like one of the most common

1669
01:29:00,651 --> 01:29:03,720
metals.
So they use this stuff.

1670
01:29:03,721 --> 01:29:06,810
How much do you need?
Like in say a tiny amount?

1671
01:29:06,840 --> 01:29:08,850
I don't think it was all that much.
I was.

1672
01:29:09,060 --> 01:29:10,570
What does it do?
I,

1673
01:29:10,890 --> 01:29:13,530
I don't.
I'm not a chemist so I can't really say.

1674
01:29:13,560 --> 01:29:17,400
He didn't get curious.
Have you found other shit you were

1675
01:29:17,401 --> 01:29:18,570
taking?
I was just like,

1676
01:29:18,750 --> 01:29:21,510
wow,
this is a peer Mtma great dude.

1677
01:29:21,511 --> 01:29:23,280
I would've been like,
hold the fuck up.

1678
01:29:23,330 --> 01:29:27,840
I'm just saying you threw a fork in
there to sit down and you gotta tell me

1679
01:29:27,841 --> 01:29:29,340
what are you doing?
What are you doing?

1680
01:29:29,341 --> 01:29:33,330
Why does it have to have aluminum foil?
We went to the FDA and we said,

1681
01:29:33,331 --> 01:29:36,360
is there some way we can take this Mtma,
which is just as pure as what we're

1682
01:29:36,361 --> 01:29:38,760
going to get and turn it into medical
grade,

1683
01:29:39,480 --> 01:29:42,900
and they said there's no way you can
really do that because you have to.

1684
01:29:43,620 --> 01:29:46,320
This is now preparing for prescription
Mtma,

1685
01:29:46,440 --> 01:29:47,370
so I understand.
All right,

1686
01:29:47,400 --> 01:29:52,170
so I have to take it from every initial
ingredient has to be verified at the

1687
01:29:52,171 --> 01:29:53,250
source,
weighed out,

1688
01:29:53,490 --> 01:29:55,740
documented,
and then you make it and then it's

1689
01:29:55,741 --> 01:29:57,150
medical grade.
Well,

1690
01:29:57,170 --> 01:29:59,230
is that right?
More or less so.

1691
01:29:59,380 --> 01:30:04,290
Of this 400,000.
We're about $75,000 is just to validate

1692
01:30:04,291 --> 01:30:09,291
all the methods that are being used.
Another 54,000 is three years.

1693
01:30:09,621 --> 01:30:12,390
Stability Studies to show that the MTMA
can last three years.

1694
01:30:12,391 --> 01:30:16,980
Even though we have mtma from 1985,
we're still using this that we have

1695
01:30:17,040 --> 01:30:19,830
stability,
purity studies on throughout the years,

1696
01:30:20,190 --> 01:30:24,870
but it's about this particular batch and
actually our 30th anniversary

1697
01:30:24,871 --> 01:30:29,310
celebration on April 17th in Oakland at
the Scottish rite center.

1698
01:30:29,311 --> 01:30:31,800
It's just a plug for a party.
This is a plug for a party.

1699
01:30:31,830 --> 01:30:36,830
There you just snuck that in is for
raising money to illegal drug deal to

1700
01:30:37,831 --> 01:30:38,910
buy this Mtma.

1701
01:30:38,940 --> 01:30:41,450
How do people find out about this?
And they didn't get there.

1702
01:30:41,580 --> 01:30:45,810
Go to the maps,
that org website and there's information

1703
01:30:45,811 --> 01:30:47,550
right on the homepage.
Powerful.

1704
01:30:47,640 --> 01:30:50,580
Thank you.
And it's about helping people though

1705
01:30:50,700 --> 01:30:54,430
also think about having dinners in their
own homes with their friends.

1706
01:30:54,450 --> 01:30:56,970
So are you going to make a holiday dude?
Why not?

1707
01:30:56,971 --> 01:30:58,950
Man?
Columbus has a fucking holiday and he's

1708
01:30:58,980 --> 01:31:02,260
widely believed to be a piece of shit,
right?

1709
01:31:03,270 --> 01:31:04,410
Uh,
yes,

1710
01:31:04,411 --> 01:31:05,250
yes.
I think,

1711
01:31:05,251 --> 01:31:07,380
um,
well let's say Lummis is supposed to be

1712
01:31:07,381 --> 01:31:08,310
a piece of shit.
Okay.

1713
01:31:08,311 --> 01:31:08,611
Well,
I,

1714
01:31:08,611 --> 01:31:12,240
I think that once we get empty medicine,
medicine and then it becomes legal and

1715
01:31:12,241 --> 01:31:14,460
then those people are doing it in
Columbus,

1716
01:31:14,510 --> 01:31:17,010
then we can turn Columbus Day into mdm a
day.

1717
01:31:17,100 --> 01:31:18,470
It's a great idea.
Coming.

1718
01:31:18,560 --> 01:31:22,350
Look,
Columbus did start something in motion,

1719
01:31:22,650 --> 01:31:25,120
but Columbus as a person,
if you google them board,

1720
01:31:25,200 --> 01:31:26,700
it was a terrible human being.

1721
01:31:26,760 --> 01:31:29,490
He was a good role.
There was an account of one of the

1722
01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:33,540
missionaries,
I believe that was there on the island.

1723
01:31:33,720 --> 01:31:36,900
I think it was a Catholic missionary,
I forget what religion,

1724
01:31:37,140 --> 01:31:39,690
but anyway,
this one religious person,

1725
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:43,740
um,
wrote this account of what Columbus and

1726
01:31:43,741 --> 01:31:48,741
his soldiers that did do some native
people and it was just horrific and you

1727
01:31:49,531 --> 01:31:52,920
realize these were the people that
everybody was worried about,

1728
01:31:52,921 --> 01:31:56,100
like we were talking about a boat shows
up and some monsters get off that boat

1729
01:31:56,490 --> 01:32:00,340
and these were the people and what they
had done to these for gold.

1730
01:32:00,340 --> 01:32:03,720
They found out at some of them had gold
and they just,

1731
01:32:03,760 --> 01:32:07,030
they just did a horrific shit.
Very similar to what like,

1732
01:32:07,031 --> 01:32:09,730
um,
happened on this coast here.

1733
01:32:10,200 --> 01:32:12,550
I'm with the INCAS,
you know,

1734
01:32:12,610 --> 01:32:13,960
the aztecs rather.
Yeah.

1735
01:32:13,961 --> 01:32:17,770
There's a story of Cabeza de Vaca.
Do you know that story?

1736
01:32:17,771 --> 01:32:19,180
Which stories?
Alvara Nunez.

1737
01:32:19,190 --> 01:32:20,710
Cabeza de Vaca.
This is the story,

1738
01:32:20,940 --> 01:32:24,610
a true story of people that found real
gold,

1739
01:32:24,720 --> 01:32:27,010
a Spanish conquistadores this,
this is,

1740
01:32:27,011 --> 01:32:29,350
um,
it's been made into a movie.

1741
01:32:29,351 --> 01:32:31,480
It should be made into a more major
movie.

1742
01:32:32,060 --> 01:32:33,600
What's that movie called?
Um,

1743
01:32:33,820 --> 01:32:36,910
children of the sun children,
the son Jimmy.

1744
01:32:37,450 --> 01:32:38,283
It was,
um,

1745
01:32:38,650 --> 01:32:41,410
I think that's what I think the movie
should be called.

1746
01:32:41,411 --> 01:32:43,940
I'm not sure if it was that.
You just make up your own names.

1747
01:32:44,680 --> 01:32:46,420
I like star wars,
Bro.

1748
01:32:46,530 --> 01:32:49,600
Well,
like big foot and his buddy in space.

1749
01:32:49,750 --> 01:32:51,060
Well,
the story that out.

1750
01:32:51,760 --> 01:32:54,520
I've written that actually this,
this is incredible.

1751
01:32:54,550 --> 01:32:58,360
This is the hidden history of America.
This is the first medium children of the

1752
01:32:58,361 --> 01:33:03,361
sun is the script I've written actually
doing man.

1753
01:33:04,180 --> 01:33:07,420
You smoked too much pot before the show.
Be honest with us a little bit.

1754
01:33:07,460 --> 01:33:09,190
That's a little bit,
a little bit.

1755
01:33:09,260 --> 01:33:10,930
That's a fault of us.
Did a little bit right?

1756
01:33:10,950 --> 01:33:11,850
Yeah.
Yeah.

1757
01:33:11,860 --> 01:33:14,470
It's good for creative brainstorming
and,

1758
01:33:14,471 --> 01:33:17,170
and so the,
and the movie the story.

1759
01:33:17,240 --> 01:33:18,910
We'll just move you that you can watch
though.

1760
01:33:19,420 --> 01:33:22,300
I think it's,
it might be Cabeza de Vaca.

1761
01:33:22,630 --> 01:33:27,100
Uh,
it's got a dwarf Sharman that doesn't

1762
01:33:27,101 --> 01:33:30,820
really exist in the real story and it's,
I think this has to be to hold true

1763
01:33:30,821 --> 01:33:33,220
because it's the hope of America.
It's the hope.

1764
01:33:33,550 --> 01:33:38,440
It's a story of a several hundred
conquistadores around 15,

1765
01:33:38,441 --> 01:33:43,441
28 trying to link up with Cortez blown
off course in a hurricane land in around

1766
01:33:44,111 --> 01:33:44,950
Tampa,
Florida,

1767
01:33:45,370 --> 01:33:47,990
and have this bunch of hundreds of these
conquistadores.

1768
01:33:48,160 --> 01:33:52,270
Only four of them survive and they
eventually,

1769
01:33:52,271 --> 01:33:54,820
one of them is black,
one of them is a more a slave.

1770
01:33:54,880 --> 01:33:59,380
The rest are white and they become
slave.

1771
01:33:59,381 --> 01:34:02,860
So they start out at the head of the
empire exploring and plundering,

1772
01:34:02,890 --> 01:34:05,440
and then they get destroyed.
They become slaves.

1773
01:34:05,530 --> 01:34:07,630
So they get captured.
They get captured.

1774
01:34:07,990 --> 01:34:10,090
Native Americans that lived in Florida.
Yeah.

1775
01:34:10,300 --> 01:34:12,310
So the native Americans that lived in
Florida,

1776
01:34:12,340 --> 01:34:13,780
the seminole tribe,
right?

1777
01:34:13,781 --> 01:34:15,280
Is that them?
I'm not sure which.

1778
01:34:15,281 --> 01:34:15,541
They,
they,

1779
01:34:15,541 --> 01:34:19,450
they ended up running away and it takes
eight years.

1780
01:34:19,900 --> 01:34:21,400
This whole process that they go through
the.

1781
01:34:21,420 --> 01:34:23,830
This is the charting.
So this is the first meeting of the

1782
01:34:23,831 --> 01:34:27,070
black,
white and red races in much of North

1783
01:34:27,070 --> 01:34:27,760
America.
Wow.

1784
01:34:27,760 --> 01:34:32,050
And at one point when they're slaves to
get some use from them,

1785
01:34:32,140 --> 01:34:34,570
the Indians,
the native Americans say they want them

1786
01:34:34,571 --> 01:34:35,860
to do some healings.

1787
01:34:35,860 --> 01:34:38,260
They think they're special.
They're there is a black person,

1788
01:34:38,920 --> 01:34:42,220
they came and they say,
we're not healers,

1789
01:34:42,221 --> 01:34:43,240
we don't,
you know,

1790
01:34:43,241 --> 01:34:45,430
and they say if you don't do it,
we're going to not feed you.

1791
01:34:45,940 --> 01:34:49,780
And they try to do a healing and it
actually works.

1792
01:34:51,010 --> 01:34:55,900
The person says they're better.
So what exists is,

1793
01:34:56,600 --> 01:34:57,370
uh,
uh,

1794
01:34:57,370 --> 01:34:59,810
the document,
there's a lot of historical documents,

1795
01:34:59,811 --> 01:35:04,280
but the point was the ailment that they
documented adapt to,

1796
01:35:04,550 --> 01:35:06,800
I don't know what it was they do talk
about.

1797
01:35:06,830 --> 01:35:08,330
Um,
but you wrote a script on it.

1798
01:35:08,750 --> 01:35:10,460
Well,
I don't remember the exact first.

1799
01:35:10,550 --> 01:35:14,210
This was a long time.
I decided that at some point I couldn't

1800
01:35:14,211 --> 01:35:17,330
try to make the movie happen and also
try to make Mtma happen

1801
01:35:19,810 --> 01:35:21,160
aside for a long time,
but it's the,

1802
01:35:21,190 --> 01:35:23,060
the,
the symbol I have set aside,

1803
01:35:23,061 --> 01:35:24,470
but I haven't even thought about for a
long time.

1804
01:35:24,470 --> 01:35:27,650
But I think that the story is important
for people to hear it.

1805
01:35:27,770 --> 01:35:29,570
Alvara Nunez,
Cabeza de Vaca,

1806
01:35:29,840 --> 01:35:32,870
they became healers and they went
eventually.

1807
01:35:32,900 --> 01:35:34,910
All they didn't.
People gave them all their stuff.

1808
01:35:35,210 --> 01:35:38,210
They didn't want it.
They just want it to go to where the,

1809
01:35:38,820 --> 01:35:41,000
um,
where they thought what Cortez was,

1810
01:35:41,030 --> 01:35:41,541
yeah,
but hold on.

1811
01:35:41,541 --> 01:35:44,430
How did they become healers?
Just because they heal this one guy that

1812
01:35:44,950 --> 01:35:45,830
they just said,
fuck,

1813
01:35:45,831 --> 01:35:48,440
this is our new job.
It seemed obviously I didn't know I was

1814
01:35:48,441 --> 01:35:50,480
magic.
Yes,

1815
01:35:50,500 --> 01:35:51,333
they,
they,

1816
01:35:51,720 --> 01:35:55,460
they were like,
they were pressed into service as

1817
01:35:55,461 --> 01:35:59,630
healers and some of them they felt were
particularly more talented than others

1818
01:35:59,631 --> 01:36:04,631
at it and they ended up with basically
that the whole groups of Indians that

1819
01:36:06,701 --> 01:36:08,600
would,
one tribe would take them to the next

1820
01:36:08,601 --> 01:36:10,580
tribe.
They had the allegiance of all of these

1821
01:36:10,581 --> 01:36:12,470
Indians and they learned to live very
humbly.

1822
01:36:12,470 --> 01:36:16,580
They didn't take stuff for themselves.
They were incredibly good survivors

1823
01:36:16,970 --> 01:36:21,970
through amazing hardships and they saw
their humanity with the Indians and they

1824
01:36:21,981 --> 01:36:24,620
had sort of conquered through love
through these healings.

1825
01:36:24,621 --> 01:36:28,150
And then they ended up getting to where
the west was to,

1826
01:36:28,280 --> 01:36:31,400
to where Cortez,
I mean we're the key stores where they

1827
01:36:31,401 --> 01:36:35,450
finally saw burned out villages and
people as slaves and they were taken,

1828
01:36:35,451 --> 01:36:38,370
captured themselves.
And Alberto Nunez,

1829
01:36:38,390 --> 01:36:43,100
Cabeza de Vaca went and was taken as
prisoner back and he had to write this

1830
01:36:43,101 --> 01:36:48,101
report to the king about what happened
to the expedition and the black men,

1831
01:36:48,650 --> 01:36:49,400
Esteban,
Nico,

1832
01:36:49,400 --> 01:36:53,420
he stayed and he traveled up and
explored a lot of California and ended

1833
01:36:53,421 --> 01:36:58,421
up being killed by the natives.
But the story Henry Miller wrote a

1834
01:36:58,701 --> 01:37:03,030
tremendous introduction to this story
about the salvation of,

1835
01:37:03,700 --> 01:37:06,760
uh,
the westward expansion,

1836
01:37:06,770 --> 01:37:09,890
the opportunity.
What it showed is that through this

1837
01:37:09,891 --> 01:37:12,710
respect,
through whatever circumstances they got,

1838
01:37:12,711 --> 01:37:15,590
they,
through cooperation and nonviolence,

1839
01:37:15,650 --> 01:37:17,450
they had the support they had.

1840
01:37:18,140 --> 01:37:19,190
And then,
well,

1841
01:37:19,191 --> 01:37:21,890
the four that they didn't kill the four
that they.

1842
01:37:21,910 --> 01:37:23,750
Yes,
96 that they killed.

1843
01:37:23,751 --> 01:37:25,470
They didn't get the.
Yeah,

1844
01:37:26,130 --> 01:37:29,270
yeah.
Took them is not in violence thing.

1845
01:37:29,271 --> 01:37:32,480
Only worked out when it got done.
Like four people.

1846
01:37:33,320 --> 01:37:36,200
That's not a good strategy.
I would say that's 96 percent

1847
01:37:36,201 --> 01:37:40,010
ineffective.
Fucking terrible idea.

1848
01:37:41,060 --> 01:37:43,580
Violence work.
These four guys live to become fucking

1849
01:37:43,581 --> 01:37:44,900
wacky.
Carnival healers.

1850
01:37:46,800 --> 01:37:50,710
I,
if you have tons of amazing look at this

1851
01:37:50,900 --> 01:37:52,400
story of,
um,

1852
01:37:52,640 --> 01:37:55,040
this report.
And then he recommended a book on

1853
01:37:55,120 --> 01:37:55,980
subject.
Yeah,

1854
01:37:55,981 --> 01:37:56,840
there is.
Um,

1855
01:37:58,050 --> 01:38:01,950
there's the actual original document
that Cubby Cabeza de Vaca,

1856
01:38:01,951 --> 01:38:03,450
Elvar Nunez,
Cabeza de Vaca,

1857
01:38:03,480 --> 01:38:06,060
the marvelous adventures of Cabeza de
Vaca,

1858
01:38:06,210 --> 01:38:08,980
I think as the translation of it.
COUPA.

1859
01:38:09,900 --> 01:38:12,150
That's the guy.
Yeah.

1860
01:38:12,450 --> 01:38:14,700
Ken Burns documentary on him called the
West,

1861
01:38:14,701 --> 01:38:17,050
I believe is what I was looking at.
Ken Burns did something on him.

1862
01:38:17,370 --> 01:38:20,580
Ken Burns do something on the web.
The wild west.

1863
01:38:20,880 --> 01:38:23,160
Wasn't that a different,
is that he did it on this guy.

1864
01:38:24,020 --> 01:38:28,380
This is the Ken Burns in it though.
It's a part of it.

1865
01:38:28,800 --> 01:38:29,633
Oh,
I see.

1866
01:38:30,300 --> 01:38:33,690
Story first appeared that kitten burdens
the West pbs documentary that first

1867
01:38:33,691 --> 01:38:36,660
aired in 1996.
Wow.

1868
01:38:37,380 --> 01:38:39,450
Yeah.
And this has been an opera about it.

1869
01:38:39,480 --> 01:38:43,260
There's also a lot of people have sort
of looked at this story and taken a lot

1870
01:38:43,261 --> 01:38:47,700
of hope from it that um,
even though it took a lot of death for

1871
01:38:47,701 --> 01:38:49,760
these people to get to this attitude
and,

1872
01:38:50,030 --> 01:38:51,590
and,
and the Indians were,

1873
01:38:51,630 --> 01:38:54,210
you know,
keeping slaves and killing each other,

1874
01:38:54,580 --> 01:38:57,810
you know,
but they were able to,

1875
01:38:57,960 --> 01:38:59,270
um,
have a,

1876
01:38:59,280 --> 01:39:03,240
a different kind of.
They got off the boat as those,

1877
01:39:03,350 --> 01:39:05,760
you know,
rampaging people,

1878
01:39:05,810 --> 01:39:08,920
but,
but they transformed into um,

1879
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:13,590
humanists and humble and actually Cabeza
de Vaca was able to go on a second

1880
01:39:13,591 --> 01:39:16,110
expedition to South America.

1881
01:39:16,440 --> 01:39:19,230
He was able to talk his way into it and
he did it.

1882
01:39:19,370 --> 01:39:22,710
He explored more areas than other people
did without killing any Indians.

1883
01:39:22,711 --> 01:39:25,560
And he discovered the request,
who falls where the movie,

1884
01:39:25,561 --> 01:39:29,430
the mission was made big waterfalls.
And so he,

1885
01:39:29,510 --> 01:39:34,510
he started demonstrated that he was a
good ambassador between cultures and

1886
01:39:34,711 --> 01:39:37,680
tried to still,
you know,

1887
01:39:37,770 --> 01:39:39,870
explore,
exploit,

1888
01:39:39,960 --> 01:39:41,770
but,
but do it in a way of,

1889
01:39:42,270 --> 01:39:44,400
uh,
a little bit more collaboration.

1890
01:39:45,030 --> 01:39:47,940
That's really interesting.
It's really interesting to think of

1891
01:39:48,060 --> 01:39:52,190
cultures colliding like that.
Some crazy people from Spain getting in

1892
01:39:52,191 --> 01:39:55,860
a boat,
getting washed out of their course and

1893
01:39:55,861 --> 01:39:57,900
landing in Florida,
climbing all,

1894
01:39:58,320 --> 01:39:59,850
trying to figure out what the hell's
going on,

1895
01:39:59,880 --> 01:40:02,460
getting attacked,
attacking people being at war.

1896
01:40:02,610 --> 01:40:05,850
And then four dudes make it through that
and live.

1897
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,730
Imagine how cool those guys must have
been like talking to them.

1898
01:40:08,860 --> 01:40:10,700
Yeah,
native American society.

1899
01:40:10,770 --> 01:40:12,300
You're so cool.
When I going to kill you,

1900
01:40:12,301 --> 01:40:12,640
man.
They,

1901
01:40:12,640 --> 01:40:16,610
they became traders for awhile before
they kind of trade d.

1902
01:40:16,660 --> 01:40:17,520
yeah.
Triggers.

1903
01:40:17,840 --> 01:40:18,720
Yes.
Traders.

1904
01:40:18,750 --> 01:40:20,450
And they could,
you know,

1905
01:40:20,460 --> 01:40:23,470
they got very hardy and our would.
Um.

1906
01:40:23,820 --> 01:40:24,653
How long did they live?

1907
01:40:26,970 --> 01:40:27,830
Some of them.
Well,

1908
01:40:27,910 --> 01:40:28,470
this,
the,

1909
01:40:28,470 --> 01:40:31,020
Nico ended up getting killed.
He stayed in Mexico.

1910
01:40:31,021 --> 01:40:34,770
He didn't want to go back to be a slave
and then he went with the Christian

1911
01:40:34,890 --> 01:40:38,790
missionaries up into California and then
got killed in California.

1912
01:40:38,840 --> 01:40:40,830
Yeah.
By native Americans here by native

1913
01:40:40,831 --> 01:40:42,100
Americans here.
Um,

1914
01:40:42,150 --> 01:40:44,220
some of the other native Americans need
a better name.

1915
01:40:45,600 --> 01:40:47,340
They do.
It's clumsy.

1916
01:40:47,370 --> 01:40:49,800
Native American saying native Americans
clumsy.

1917
01:40:49,980 --> 01:40:54,980
Saying Indian is even more clumsy.
I like a first nation that's like with

1918
01:40:56,110 --> 01:40:59,140
the Canadians use.
I liked that first nations.

1919
01:40:59,290 --> 01:41:01,540
That's,
that's their real claim right there.

1920
01:41:01,541 --> 01:41:05,530
First nation because the bottom line is
as far as we know their first nation,

1921
01:41:05,531 --> 01:41:07,060
but we don't,
you know.

1922
01:41:07,600 --> 01:41:10,450
Well,
we did a study in Canada with first

1923
01:41:10,451 --> 01:41:13,480
nations people who were suffering from
addiction because their,

1924
01:41:13,500 --> 01:41:16,090
their culture has been under such
attack,

1925
01:41:16,600 --> 01:41:21,340
but it was,
I'm Peruvian Third World Peruvian

1926
01:41:21,370 --> 01:41:26,370
shamans bringing Iowasca to work with
first nations people who were addicted

1927
01:41:27,161 --> 01:41:27,790
with,
uh,

1928
01:41:27,790 --> 01:41:30,020
Dr Gobler Montay,
Western psychiatrist.

1929
01:41:30,730 --> 01:41:32,710
It's kind of,
that guy's amazing.

1930
01:41:32,860 --> 01:41:37,860
He is mediating this
excession run by and then we were able

1931
01:41:40,241 --> 01:41:41,074
to,
um,

1932
01:41:41,320 --> 01:41:45,430
support the team that did some outcome
measures and suggested that,

1933
01:41:45,750 --> 01:41:46,900
that this,
um,

1934
01:41:47,350 --> 01:41:49,030
third world,
first world,

1935
01:41:49,210 --> 01:41:53,110
first nations people that these w,
it's cultural bumping into each other

1936
01:41:53,111 --> 01:41:56,140
all over now more ever than before in
the history of the world.

1937
01:41:56,141 --> 01:41:57,850
Probably.
He's that cultural appropriation or.

1938
01:41:57,860 --> 01:42:01,360
No,
I think it's appropriation.

1939
01:42:01,540 --> 01:42:02,710
If,
um,

1940
01:42:02,920 --> 01:42:04,690
if you don't,
if you steal,

1941
01:42:04,740 --> 01:42:07,890
you can tend to be a native American and
hold your own pod ceremonies,

1942
01:42:08,100 --> 01:42:10,780
the that and on,
and red paint.

1943
01:42:10,840 --> 01:42:13,090
I think the,
the flattery,

1944
01:42:13,270 --> 01:42:16,120
imitation is the most sincere form of
flattery.

1945
01:42:16,121 --> 01:42:20,080
So I think it's like you want people to
adopt if you think it's good,

1946
01:42:20,860 --> 01:42:23,590
but they don't have to adapt your dogma
or your rituals.

1947
01:42:23,591 --> 01:42:25,910
I mean,
I see that with our mdms,

1948
01:42:25,950 --> 01:42:29,170
we have our method and we have it.
Everything is videotaped.

1949
01:42:29,470 --> 01:42:32,170
We even have it scored.
We have raiders that look at the

1950
01:42:32,171 --> 01:42:35,860
therapist and score them on how much
they're implying that we're hearing with

1951
01:42:35,861 --> 01:42:38,080
our method,
but we want other people with other

1952
01:42:38,081 --> 01:42:42,460
methods to use it and
see how it works in other contexts.

1953
01:42:42,670 --> 01:42:45,400
Native Americans have their own rules,
right.

1954
01:42:45,430 --> 01:42:48,160
When they have in their territories,
they can.

1955
01:42:48,161 --> 01:42:53,140
That's why they can put casinos up in
there as do they have rules as far as

1956
01:42:53,141 --> 01:42:55,540
psychedelic drugs,
they have their own rules.

1957
01:42:56,200 --> 01:42:59,930
Well,
they have because on tribal lands,

1958
01:42:59,970 --> 01:43:03,280
right?
Well first off they have authority and

1959
01:43:03,340 --> 01:43:05,260
tribal lands,
but a lot of people work in the military

1960
01:43:05,261 --> 01:43:08,710
or do stuff with the federal government,
so they have the religious freedom to

1961
01:43:08,711 --> 01:43:11,560
practice.
The native American church is the US

1962
01:43:11,560 --> 01:43:14,350
Supreme Court upheld and a congress that
they can,

1963
01:43:15,370 --> 01:43:19,510
but the federal government actually
tried to limit it so that if you had to

1964
01:43:19,511 --> 01:43:23,290
have 25 percent Indian blood to be part
of the native American church in order

1965
01:43:23,291 --> 01:43:27,430
to participate in the pod rituals,
the states don't have that kind of

1966
01:43:27,460 --> 01:43:31,600
racial requirement,
but to try to prevent the spread of this

1967
01:43:31,601 --> 01:43:36,601
religion from the native Americans to
wider groups of hippies and others that

1968
01:43:36,641 --> 01:43:38,380
like pod,
you know,

1969
01:43:38,381 --> 01:43:40,690
they tried to make a racial.
The federal government does have this

1970
01:43:40,691 --> 01:43:43,330
racial limit,
but it's largely ignored and it's

1971
01:43:43,331 --> 01:43:44,530
ignored by the states.

1972
01:43:44,680 --> 01:43:47,470
That's why white dudes were trying to be
Rastafarians.

1973
01:43:47,530 --> 01:43:50,050
Remember that?
That's where white dirty,

1974
01:43:50,051 --> 01:43:52,190
stinky people with dreadlocks came from.

1975
01:43:52,400 --> 01:43:57,400
That's how it was reignited
that we're all fans of Bob Marley.

1976
01:43:57,700 --> 01:44:01,080
Right?
That's why they.

1977
01:44:01,220 --> 01:44:05,660
I knew a dude who was a pot dealer and
he claimed Rastafari and he said,

1978
01:44:05,661 --> 01:44:07,220
this is part of my religion,
man.

1979
01:44:07,221 --> 01:44:08,620
It was like real serious.
Right?

1980
01:44:08,690 --> 01:44:11,570
In those cases,
they've lost in court or they have,

1981
01:44:11,571 --> 01:44:13,180
but they didn't lose the.
What is it?

1982
01:44:13,181 --> 01:44:14,120
Assented to die.
May,

1983
01:44:14,121 --> 01:44:17,750
what is the church,
he said the son to die mate went up to

1984
01:44:17,751 --> 01:44:19,700
the ninth circuit.
It didn't go to the Supreme Court,

1985
01:44:19,730 --> 01:44:21,140
but the,
when y'all do vegetal,

1986
01:44:21,160 --> 01:44:25,700
I just came from Santa Fe this morning
and that's where the lead church,

1987
01:44:25,730 --> 01:44:30,730
the y'all hall was located in Santa Fe
and it was Jeffrey Bronfman from the

1988
01:44:31,010 --> 01:44:35,210
Canadian Jewish Bronfman family from
Seagram's fortune,

1989
01:44:35,570 --> 01:44:37,640
from smuggling alcohol during
prohibition,

1990
01:44:37,641 --> 01:44:41,120
and then building this massive business
as one of the grandkids.

1991
01:44:41,150 --> 01:44:45,500
He ended up becoming appreciative of
IOWASCA.

1992
01:44:45,950 --> 01:44:50,950
And so he hired the best lawyers and
worked on this case that they won a

1993
01:44:52,190 --> 01:44:56,720
unanimous supreme court case affirming
the vegetal,

1994
01:44:56,780 --> 01:44:58,070
the Union of the plants.

1995
01:44:58,070 --> 01:44:59,300
It's,
it's two different plants,

1996
01:44:59,301 --> 01:45:04,240
roots and
vines and leaves and um,

1997
01:45:05,360 --> 01:45:10,360
you put it together so to the union hall
were um,

1998
01:45:11,710 --> 01:45:14,150
and they have legal protection in the
United States.

1999
01:45:14,930 --> 01:45:15,920
On the other hand,
it's,

2000
01:45:15,980 --> 01:45:17,930
you know,
it's a church.

2001
01:45:17,950 --> 01:45:22,700
Um,
I went to it and I was hearing I,

2002
01:45:22,750 --> 01:45:27,140
I really enjoyed.
I went to it twice and the second time

2003
01:45:27,141 --> 01:45:29,150
it was like,
here's the myth of our church,

2004
01:45:29,180 --> 01:45:33,380
the myth of the or the origin myth.
And part of it was that King Solomon

2005
01:45:34,460 --> 01:45:38,840
went to the Amazon and told them how to
put these plants together.

2006
01:45:38,890 --> 01:45:40,480
Right.
And I'm like,

2007
01:45:40,880 --> 01:45:41,713
King Solomon.

2008
01:45:43,680 --> 01:45:45,140
And so there's,
it's just,

2009
01:45:45,170 --> 01:45:47,120
it is a religion.
Right?

2010
01:45:47,300 --> 01:45:49,190
So I think that,
um,

2011
01:45:49,250 --> 01:45:51,770
well that's why,
that's why the Supreme Court agreed with

2012
01:45:51,771 --> 01:45:53,840
it because it's so wacky.
Like,

2013
01:45:53,841 --> 01:45:55,460
yeah,
you guys sound like a religion,

2014
01:45:56,640 --> 01:45:57,560
right?
I mean,

2015
01:45:57,590 --> 01:45:59,750
but it's happening.
So they know that they didn't make it

2016
01:45:59,751 --> 01:46:00,840
up.
I will ask,

2017
01:46:01,070 --> 01:46:03,830
uh,
having an incredible effect in America.

2018
01:46:04,310 --> 01:46:07,130
It's really amazing.
The number of different people that are

2019
01:46:07,131 --> 01:46:10,130
using it,
not necessarily in these exact religious

2020
01:46:10,131 --> 01:46:13,610
context,
but in kind of shamanistic or personal

2021
01:46:13,611 --> 01:46:16,940
growth or more or,
or kind of little modified or,

2022
01:46:16,941 --> 01:46:20,570
or even in these services.
Why hasn't that religion expanded?

2023
01:46:21,170 --> 01:46:21,951
Well,
it's,

2024
01:46:21,951 --> 01:46:22,784
um,
it,

2025
01:46:22,840 --> 01:46:26,210
it's being used quite a lot.
There's a lot of ceremonies in

2026
01:46:26,211 --> 01:46:27,500
California,
all over America,

2027
01:46:27,501 --> 01:46:29,920
all over the world with Iowasca.
It's just,

2028
01:46:29,960 --> 01:46:34,960
but this union to vegetal udv that.
But they have,

2029
01:46:35,460 --> 01:46:37,480
they're expanding somewhat,
but there,

2030
01:46:38,190 --> 01:46:39,760
it's,
how do they have authority?

2031
01:46:39,810 --> 01:46:42,860
They have authority.
They have legal authority from the US

2032
01:46:42,860 --> 01:46:43,730
Supreme Court.
They're the only ones,

2033
01:46:44,210 --> 01:46:46,190
the Santa diamond went up to the ninth
circuit.

2034
01:46:46,191 --> 01:46:48,950
So they essentially have the same
argument that the,

2035
01:46:49,010 --> 01:46:50,010
it just didn't get appealed

2036
01:46:50,010 --> 01:46:53,560
to the Supreme Court by the prosecutor.
So that the new united,

2037
01:46:53,580 --> 01:46:56,660
the vegetal I didn't say you.
Now when the owl hoo and yell,

2038
01:46:56,700 --> 01:46:59,940
when do vegetal they do have that.
So they're locked down.

2039
01:46:59,970 --> 01:47:01,170
They are,
yes.

2040
01:47:01,171 --> 01:47:02,640
And sends a dime.
He is too.

2041
01:47:02,670 --> 01:47:05,790
But as I said,
if they want in the appeals court and

2042
01:47:06,020 --> 01:47:09,080
when you got to get Richard Branson,
you got to get Richard Branson evolved

2043
01:47:09,090 --> 01:47:12,530
and start opening these bitches up like
right next to virgin records,

2044
01:47:12,690 --> 01:47:16,230
leverage records anymore.
Why haven't they expanded more?

2045
01:47:16,231 --> 01:47:17,540
And part of it is,
you know,

2046
01:47:17,610 --> 01:47:18,580
how,
um,

2047
01:47:18,810 --> 01:47:21,150
cultural integration,
so cultural appropriation,

2048
01:47:21,151 --> 01:47:24,960
but cultural integration,
so they're bringing a tradition from a

2049
01:47:24,961 --> 01:47:26,580
different culture,
um,

2050
01:47:27,630 --> 01:47:30,660
and they're trying to integrate it at a
rate where it doesn't,

2051
01:47:31,170 --> 01:47:33,780
it grows,
it's constitutionally protected,

2052
01:47:33,781 --> 01:47:37,680
but it doesn't grow too fast.
Maybe there's a way where it could grow

2053
01:47:37,681 --> 01:47:42,030
too fast and there wouldn't be the care
and the use of the tea and they want to

2054
01:47:42,031 --> 01:47:44,730
make sure that it's responsibly handled.

2055
01:47:44,850 --> 01:47:46,410
These are the people that are running
your church.

2056
01:47:47,120 --> 01:47:48,030
Yeah.
Yes,

2057
01:47:48,180 --> 01:47:48,750
yes,
yes.

2058
01:47:48,750 --> 01:47:50,730
Jeffrey Brockman and they're just too
busy getting high.

2059
01:47:50,731 --> 01:47:52,470
They want to keep it on the DL.
No,

2060
01:47:52,520 --> 01:47:53,353
no,
no,

2061
01:47:54,320 --> 01:47:54,910
no,
no.

2062
01:47:54,910 --> 01:47:57,150
They out and lay on the floor.
Well,

2063
01:47:57,330 --> 01:47:59,550
you know,
you don't hide by going to the Supreme

2064
01:47:59,550 --> 01:48:00,430
Court,
obviously.

2065
01:48:00,780 --> 01:48:03,750
Yeah,
but I think it's amazing that they did

2066
01:48:03,810 --> 01:48:05,430
actually get the ruling.
I mean,

2067
01:48:05,431 --> 01:48:09,120
that's amazing that they're taking one
of the most potent psychedelic drugs

2068
01:48:09,121 --> 01:48:11,760
known to man.
It's true and.

2069
01:48:11,790 --> 01:48:15,240
But they got the support of mainstream
religions because there's a lot of weird

2070
01:48:15,241 --> 01:48:19,350
things that mainstream religions do for
cultural practices or even hasn't a

2071
01:48:19,390 --> 01:48:21,330
precedent been set with wine?
Yeah.

2072
01:48:21,390 --> 01:48:24,750
Yeah.
It's most certainly a drug and it can be

2073
01:48:24,751 --> 01:48:29,751
used by children in certain ritual
ceremonies and it can,

2074
01:48:31,060 --> 01:48:34,020
but it's a common part of Catholicism,
like wind is a,

2075
01:48:34,021 --> 01:48:35,310
is a very common part.

2076
01:48:36,150 --> 01:48:40,080
There's a lot of weird stuff in religion
and as soon as you start saying that one

2077
01:48:40,081 --> 01:48:41,780
person can't do their weeds,
weird stuff,

2078
01:48:41,781 --> 01:48:42,500
they go,
okay,

2079
01:48:42,500 --> 01:48:44,580
well what kind of weird stuff do you get
exemptions for?

2080
01:48:44,840 --> 01:48:46,290
And you look at their exemptions.
You're like,

2081
01:48:46,291 --> 01:48:47,100
well,
what?

2082
01:48:47,100 --> 01:48:49,650
You can cut baby Dick's.
What are you doing?

2083
01:48:49,651 --> 01:48:51,750
You're rubbing dirt on your forehead on
Wednesday.

2084
01:48:51,880 --> 01:48:55,560
Will you guys,
what the fuck are you doing in the idea

2085
01:48:55,561 --> 01:48:58,650
that one could make fun of the other
assist at a certain point in time.

2086
01:48:58,651 --> 01:49:00,690
So you guys have blinders on.
Okay.

2087
01:49:01,050 --> 01:49:04,590
This whole thing is pretty wacky.
The Union Union vegetable,

2088
01:49:04,591 --> 01:49:07,170
they might have the right idea.
That might be the only way to do it.

2089
01:49:07,500 --> 01:49:09,990
Well,
the part about that that's really good

2090
01:49:09,991 --> 01:49:13,770
is that while they have their dog man
and their their traditions,

2091
01:49:13,830 --> 01:49:17,190
it's about the experience.
It's about the individual experience for

2092
01:49:17,191 --> 01:49:17,790
yourself.

2093
01:49:17,790 --> 01:49:22,050
Rick strassman did it with them and he
told me it was very strange.

2094
01:49:22,620 --> 01:49:26,190
He said it's really strong,
really strong IOWASCA,

2095
01:49:26,191 --> 01:49:30,420
and they sing songs about Jesus.
Well Daddy,

2096
01:49:30,990 --> 01:49:32,590
what that like?
Yeah,

2097
01:49:32,730 --> 01:49:34,840
it's a trip.
Yeah.

2098
01:49:36,630 --> 01:49:39,270
I think you'd have to have a generous
spirit in a way like,

2099
01:49:39,271 --> 01:49:40,230
okay,
it's Jesus,

2100
01:49:40,231 --> 01:49:45,231
but you know it's about reverence and
you kind of generalize and you're

2101
01:49:47,010 --> 01:49:49,570
thinking about this the other day,
and tell me if this makes any sense to

2102
01:49:49,571 --> 01:49:53,360
you.
If you have this idea when you go like

2103
01:49:53,860 --> 01:49:55,990
when you take.
I've never done Iowasca,

2104
01:49:55,991 --> 01:49:59,230
but I've done dmt on multiple occasions,
right?

2105
01:49:59,231 --> 01:50:03,220
So I've had this psychedelic effect,
the most potent version of that.

2106
01:50:03,221 --> 01:50:07,390
Right?
I would wonder if you went in with the

2107
01:50:07,391 --> 01:50:11,590
intention and had these experiences with
the intention to communicate with some

2108
01:50:11,591 --> 01:50:16,591
benevolent deity that you believe is
responsible for all life and all love on

2109
01:50:17,471 --> 01:50:18,304
the planet.

2110
01:50:18,310 --> 01:50:23,310
If you kept thinking of that as you
entered into this dimethyltryptamine

2111
01:50:24,521 --> 01:50:29,260
state of consciousness,
isn't it possible that a vast majority

2112
01:50:29,261 --> 01:50:34,261
of what is happening when you are having
a psychedelic trip is the word

2113
01:50:34,811 --> 01:50:36,850
hallucination?
It's very strange because with the

2114
01:50:36,851 --> 01:50:41,260
hallucination implies is in this world,
but we're sitting right here with tables

2115
01:50:41,261 --> 01:50:44,020
and chairs and rooms.
Something could.

2116
01:50:44,080 --> 01:50:46,090
You could see it,
but it could not be real.

2117
01:50:46,750 --> 01:50:51,750
The problem with that is like what are
you seeing and why can't other people?

2118
01:50:52,060 --> 01:50:53,230
Can other people see it too?
Well,

2119
01:50:53,231 --> 01:50:55,030
if other people could see it,
then it's not a hallucination.

2120
01:50:55,031 --> 01:50:57,220
Right,
so it's how do you know what other

2121
01:50:57,221 --> 01:50:59,170
people are saying,
we really don't right now.

2122
01:50:59,171 --> 01:51:00,820
How do you know when you close your
eyes,

2123
01:51:00,821 --> 01:51:04,810
you're on a psychedelic drug.
How much of what you're experiencing is

2124
01:51:04,811 --> 01:51:09,100
your visual cortex interacting with your
mind,

2125
01:51:09,101 --> 01:51:13,330
interacting with these drugs and your
your creativity and your consciousness

2126
01:51:13,730 --> 01:51:18,730
are colliding and gliding and dancing
together along with your imagination and

2127
01:51:19,721 --> 01:51:22,480
in the hold on a second and in this
moment,

2128
01:51:22,510 --> 01:51:27,510
if you go into that with his intention,
your imagination can conjure up this

2129
01:51:27,821 --> 01:51:32,821
Jesus type character in the IOWASCA
ceremony and he can be real and he can

2130
01:51:32,831 --> 01:51:36,910
be what you want him to be and he could
be a manifestation of your own

2131
01:51:36,911 --> 01:51:41,710
experiences in this life that you've
carried around as memories and carried

2132
01:51:41,711 --> 01:51:44,350
around as emotions and that in this
psychedelic state.

2133
01:51:44,350 --> 01:51:47,110
If you continually go to it with that
intention,

2134
01:51:47,140 --> 01:51:50,260
it's entirely possible that they do
experience something like that.

2135
01:51:51,100 --> 01:51:53,020
Exactly.
I think that you,

2136
01:51:53,290 --> 01:51:58,290
we see through our own filters and we
see a lot of times what we want to see

2137
01:51:58,361 --> 01:52:03,361
and that we can coalesce a lot of
feelings and images that are pre verbal

2138
01:52:04,961 --> 01:52:07,110
into certain kinds of symbols.
Well,

2139
01:52:07,120 --> 01:52:10,360
especially if you're on it and insanely
potent psychedelic drug.

2140
01:52:11,110 --> 01:52:13,630
Yeah,
so the idea that we ever know the

2141
01:52:13,631 --> 01:52:18,631
ultimate truth that it's not somehow or
other filter through our preconceptions.

2142
01:52:19,260 --> 01:52:23,620
I'm John Lilly wrote this great book.
One of the things he did,

2143
01:52:23,621 --> 01:52:26,430
I thought it was great.
It was called simulations of God and

2144
01:52:26,431 --> 01:52:30,070
it's like different conceptions that
people have of God and how you get to

2145
01:52:30,071 --> 01:52:33,370
these views and then there's a way to
transcend that and see something even

2146
01:52:33,371 --> 01:52:38,260
deeper and deeper and that,
that we have these filters and so the

2147
01:52:38,261 --> 01:52:40,990
culture is.
And the context is more important than

2148
01:52:40,991 --> 01:52:43,180
the drug.
So I think one of the issues of the

2149
01:52:43,181 --> 01:52:45,980
sixties was people had so much faith
that they

2150
01:52:45,980 --> 01:52:48,320
wanted so much cultural change.
They were so.

2151
01:52:48,890 --> 01:52:51,800
It was such a strife filled time that
they had this hope,

2152
01:52:51,830 --> 01:52:53,720
this unreasonable hope that the drugs
were enough.

2153
01:52:53,721 --> 01:52:57,140
That the psychedelics were enough that
they would somehow or other bring this

2154
01:52:57,560 --> 01:53:02,560
connection to the truth to to this new
understanding just by themselves and

2155
01:53:04,040 --> 01:53:09,040
it's really more about the context,
but the context and with a proper open

2156
01:53:09,531 --> 01:53:14,531
context and in our case a therapeutic
context in the experimental sense.

2157
01:53:15,050 --> 01:53:20,050
Then when you add the pharmacology,
it produces really unusual opportunities

2158
01:53:22,460 --> 01:53:27,460
to go very deep and that's what I think
we can show that we can do that and

2159
01:53:29,091 --> 01:53:34,091
contain it in a regulatory therapeutic
healing context that can slowly be

2160
01:53:34,611 --> 01:53:39,611
accepted by a our culture and that
that's really the of the value

2161
01:53:43,161 --> 01:53:45,380
proposition that we're presenting to the
FDA.

2162
01:53:45,690 --> 01:53:47,810
The way you described it as why maps are
so important,

2163
01:53:47,930 --> 01:53:50,810
because I'm talking about making Jesus
exists when you're tripping balls,

2164
01:53:51,080 --> 01:53:51,800
I'm making your own.

2165
01:53:51,800 --> 01:53:56,360
Jesus like while you're tripping and you
bring it back to studies and science and

2166
01:53:56,361 --> 01:54:00,410
data and presented the paper.
I'm wearing a tie.

2167
01:54:00,740 --> 01:54:02,630
Okay.
And so for us,

2168
01:54:02,720 --> 01:54:03,590
yes,
yes.

2169
01:54:04,030 --> 01:54:07,310
We're actually discussing should I wear
a tie at the 30th better or or not,

2170
01:54:07,400 --> 01:54:09,920
but what are you going to do a.
I haven't decided yet.

2171
01:54:09,921 --> 01:54:11,950
I just dress like Jimi Hendrix,
but,

2172
01:54:11,951 --> 01:54:16,610
but the date that the data is really
this,

2173
01:54:16,650 --> 01:54:20,750
I'm double checking of what we think is
true.

2174
01:54:20,850 --> 01:54:24,590
Right?
And it's a way where we have to have

2175
01:54:24,591 --> 01:54:27,960
that humility that we don't necessarily
know this ultimate truth,

2176
01:54:27,961 --> 01:54:30,320
but there's no way to know.
And that's not just humility,

2177
01:54:30,321 --> 01:54:32,570
that's just a fact.
There's no way to know what you're

2178
01:54:32,571 --> 01:54:34,910
experiencing with anybody else's
experiencing when they're tripping.

2179
01:54:34,940 --> 01:54:36,950
You really don't know.
We don't know what it is.

2180
01:54:37,280 --> 01:54:40,730
And it's entirely possible that it's
something that we don't understand yet.

2181
01:54:40,870 --> 01:54:41,810
Yeah.
And so,

2182
01:54:41,840 --> 01:54:45,440
so the reason I brought it back in a way
to the science is that we're

2183
01:54:45,441 --> 01:54:50,441
operationalizing its effect on symptoms.
So whether you have this memory that is

2184
01:54:51,711 --> 01:54:54,590
actually true.
So whether it's Jesus or whether you're

2185
01:54:54,890 --> 01:54:58,250
remembering childhood sexual abuse,
whether that.

2186
01:54:58,280 --> 01:54:59,810
I don't like how you tied the two of
those together.

2187
01:54:59,870 --> 01:55:04,870
I was right about the Catholic church.
There was a little stop.

2188
01:55:05,231 --> 01:55:06,940
A few things I leaped over there,
but,

2189
01:55:08,420 --> 01:55:12,770
but,
but whether that occurred in actuality

2190
01:55:12,830 --> 01:55:17,060
is an important question for the legal
system more for other ways,

2191
01:55:17,061 --> 01:55:19,010
but from a therapeutic,
from healing,

2192
01:55:19,011 --> 01:55:22,520
from a compassionate point of view,
if this expression,

2193
01:55:22,521 --> 01:55:26,810
if it's symbolic or actual,
if it has the consequence of helping

2194
01:55:26,811 --> 01:55:31,400
people come to terms with themselves and
to get more acceptance about what

2195
01:55:31,401 --> 01:55:33,680
happened.
That's what we're looking at.

2196
01:55:33,681 --> 01:55:36,950
We're looking at the outcomes.
So I think that that's the practical

2197
01:55:36,951 --> 01:55:37,220
part.

2198
01:55:37,220 --> 01:55:39,950
That's the science part.
It's like there are questions.

2199
01:55:40,270 --> 01:55:40,820
Um,
I,

2200
01:55:40,820 --> 01:55:42,260
I believe I,
I,

2201
01:55:42,270 --> 01:55:44,310
for a lot of times in my early lsd
trips,

2202
01:55:44,311 --> 01:55:47,580
I wanted God to show up and I wanted the
truth.

2203
01:55:47,610 --> 01:55:49,900
How arrogant is not busy.
Yeah.

2204
01:55:50,180 --> 01:55:51,510
Yeah.
God doesn't have a lot of other shit

2205
01:55:51,511 --> 01:55:54,990
going on.
I remember from my bar where I was like,

2206
01:55:54,991 --> 01:55:56,740
the very next day,
Barb Mitzvah,

2207
01:55:56,760 --> 01:55:57,870
what the fuck?
God,

2208
01:55:57,930 --> 01:55:59,430
you know,
I studied all this Hebrew,

2209
01:56:00,460 --> 01:56:03,630
so in my bed the next day after my
birthday.

2210
01:56:03,640 --> 01:56:05,610
So I was like,
I was the same.

2211
01:56:05,611 --> 01:56:06,780
I mean,
like I'm not a man.

2212
01:56:06,781 --> 01:56:09,450
I'm not any different than there was.
And I,

2213
01:56:09,451 --> 01:56:10,100
I,
I,

2214
01:56:10,100 --> 01:56:10,933
I couldn't,
uh,

2215
01:56:11,340 --> 01:56:13,770
took me a couple of days where I thought
God was maybe busy,

2216
01:56:13,771 --> 01:56:17,820
maybe a lot of people got bar Mitzvah'd
that day and after like a week I

2217
01:56:17,821 --> 01:56:18,680
recognize,
you know,

2218
01:56:18,780 --> 01:56:21,900
I'm not going to change and it's going
to take something else.

2219
01:56:21,901 --> 01:56:24,720
The ritual didn't quite do it.
And then even with my lsd trips,

2220
01:56:25,410 --> 01:56:30,410
wanting to see God wanting to have this
clarity and not quite getting it,

2221
01:56:30,601 --> 01:56:33,810
and then appreciating that,
that that was a delusion in some ways

2222
01:56:33,811 --> 01:56:38,010
that keeping the uncertainty is keeping
integrity.

2223
01:56:38,011 --> 01:56:39,360
And,
and um,

2224
01:56:40,860 --> 01:56:43,920
but there's that strong longing for that
for certainty.

2225
01:56:44,650 --> 01:56:47,280
You're sounding like a dude who's
rationalizing that he didn't get to meet

2226
01:56:47,281 --> 01:56:48,114
God.
He's upset.

2227
01:56:48,530 --> 01:56:50,490
God didn't show up.
The whole thing will be different,

2228
01:56:50,491 --> 01:56:53,460
right?
Because it's like aliens and visit

2229
01:56:53,461 --> 01:56:57,330
everybody when he does visit.
It's a very unique experience and it's

2230
01:56:57,331 --> 01:56:59,270
real.
I don't know,

2231
01:56:59,280 --> 01:57:01,830
man.
I think there's real problem in saying,

2232
01:57:01,831 --> 01:57:03,180
you know,
what other people experience,

2233
01:57:03,181 --> 01:57:05,910
whether it's under the influence of
psychedelic drugs or whether it's

2234
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:08,730
completely sober or whether it's been in
a meditative state.

2235
01:57:08,760 --> 01:57:12,540
The idea that anybody can tell you what
you experienced or what you got out of

2236
01:57:12,541 --> 01:57:15,450
something is foolish,
so then it becomes a matter of whether

2237
01:57:15,451 --> 01:57:19,020
or not we're protecting people,
so if our laws are designed to protect

2238
01:57:19,021 --> 01:57:21,000
people,
we should do it scientifically.

2239
01:57:21,001 --> 01:57:24,900
We should look across the board at all
the damaging things and we don't do that

2240
01:57:24,901 --> 01:57:27,240
at all.
That's why the government never

2241
01:57:27,241 --> 01:57:31,470
discusses cigarettes because we all know
how many people cigarettes kill every

2242
01:57:31,470 --> 01:57:31,470
year.

2243
01:57:31,470 --> 01:57:33,660
It's in the hundreds of thousands and no
one brings it up.

2244
01:57:33,661 --> 01:57:36,270
No one running for president,
no one running for Congress.

2245
01:57:36,480 --> 01:57:38,820
They just don't bring it up.
It's not something they want to fight

2246
01:57:38,821 --> 01:57:41,190
against because if they do,
they'll get slaughtered with money.

2247
01:57:41,550 --> 01:57:44,550
So it's not about whether or not they're
trying to protect us.

2248
01:57:44,551 --> 01:57:46,800
So then what is it about,
although at the same time,

2249
01:57:46,810 --> 01:57:49,500
cigarette use has been going down a
little.

2250
01:57:49,560 --> 01:57:51,960
It's still half a million people die
every year in this country.

2251
01:57:51,990 --> 01:57:52,830
It's still.
Yeah,

2252
01:57:53,130 --> 01:57:55,020
it's still.
It's crazy.

2253
01:57:55,021 --> 01:57:58,350
If it was just 5,000 people in pot,
how quick would they shut it down?

2254
01:57:58,830 --> 01:58:01,890
If 5,000 people died prematurely?
Every year because of marijuana,

2255
01:58:01,891 --> 01:58:05,030
how quick would it be?
The Demon of television?

2256
01:58:05,031 --> 01:58:08,400
It depends on what we do,
about the benefit side of the equation.

2257
01:58:08,430 --> 01:58:10,680
It's not.
Nobody doesn't exist though.

2258
01:58:10,750 --> 01:58:12,420
Hold the unit.
You see what I'm saying?

2259
01:58:12,420 --> 01:58:15,080
Like 35,000 isn't dying.
Right?

2260
01:58:15,420 --> 01:58:20,340
But if it was the 500,000 or diving from
cigarettes are extremely significant,

2261
01:58:20,350 --> 01:58:21,840
right?
Well what should be done,

2262
01:58:22,620 --> 01:58:27,030
but we should do is make everything
legal and then let people figure out

2263
01:58:27,031 --> 01:58:28,700
what you want to do and not want to do
this,

2264
01:58:28,710 --> 01:58:30,900
which is what we do with most things
today,

2265
01:58:31,120 --> 01:58:33,090
right?
Most things like cigarettes and alcohol

2266
01:58:33,091 --> 01:58:34,770
that can kill you.
We let you try.

2267
01:58:35,490 --> 01:58:37,110
Exactly because no one should be able to
tell you what to do.

2268
01:58:37,111 --> 01:58:39,210
Man,
if you want to Charles boot Koski it and

2269
01:58:39,211 --> 01:58:42,200
just drink and smoke yourself to an
early grave and just

2270
01:58:42,550 --> 01:58:45,820
scribble the coolest shit along the way.
Who gives a fuck?

2271
01:58:46,800 --> 01:58:48,100
It's all finite,
right?

2272
01:58:48,260 --> 01:58:51,270
Who's one person tell another person
that they can't be Amex,

2273
01:58:51,280 --> 01:58:52,420
jump or skydive?
Well,

2274
01:58:52,890 --> 01:58:55,420
I think you're going to have that.
I want you to be free.

2275
01:58:55,421 --> 01:58:57,370
I want to be free to do what I feel I
should do.

2276
01:58:57,610 --> 01:59:00,070
You should have the same freedom,
but if you are hurting yourself,

2277
01:59:00,071 --> 01:59:05,071
I am compassionate and let's try to see
are you struggling with your own trauma

2278
01:59:05,531 --> 01:59:06,340
or what?
But,

2279
01:59:06,340 --> 01:59:08,750
but not to try to,
um,

2280
01:59:09,030 --> 01:59:11,840
what,
what do you do about rock climbers and

2281
01:59:11,860 --> 01:59:13,060
yeah,
you're just trying to get safe

2282
01:59:13,061 --> 01:59:15,910
equipment.
Either run with bad childhoods.

2283
01:59:15,960 --> 01:59:18,390
He cut them off,
you know,

2284
01:59:18,840 --> 01:59:23,620
um,
people can make choices about risk in

2285
01:59:23,621 --> 01:59:27,430
different ways and I think you really,
at some point,

2286
01:59:27,580 --> 01:59:30,010
you know,
where does it shade into suicide and.

2287
01:59:32,630 --> 01:59:34,460
Well,
I do think suicide should be illegal.

2288
01:59:34,490 --> 01:59:35,570
There's another one.
Well,

2289
01:59:35,720 --> 01:59:37,370
I think the,
um,

2290
01:59:38,390 --> 01:59:40,520
I think there should be.
I mean,

2291
01:59:41,290 --> 01:59:44,710
the,
I don't think you should be punished if

2292
01:59:44,720 --> 01:59:49,610
you tried to get committed suicide and
you survived then fuck right.

2293
01:59:50,120 --> 01:59:55,120
I don't think he need that America
because I think it should be against the

2294
01:59:56,061 --> 02:00:00,710
law and I think this is suicide when
people are end of life and pain.

2295
02:00:01,030 --> 02:00:03,680
It makes sense to me certainly,
but there has to be a lot of

2296
02:00:04,190 --> 02:00:06,530
protections.
But I think there is this general

2297
02:00:07,310 --> 02:00:12,200
feeling like life is a gift that I have
and that that somehow we need to run its

2298
02:00:12,201 --> 02:00:14,390
course rather than,
well,

2299
02:00:14,391 --> 02:00:17,510
I think this is another way we're mtma
therapy will help.

2300
02:00:17,960 --> 02:00:20,930
And I think that there's a lot of people
that are haunted by their memories,

2301
02:00:21,020 --> 02:00:23,630
memories of their past,
memories of their own failures,

2302
02:00:23,640 --> 02:00:23,930
ma'am.

2303
02:00:23,930 --> 02:00:27,290
Memories of things that they did wrong.
And those things can really fuck with

2304
02:00:27,291 --> 02:00:28,370
you.
You know,

2305
02:00:28,820 --> 02:00:32,990
people define themselves in this weird
way like by their past failures like

2306
02:00:32,991 --> 02:00:34,850
that is.
That's all the experience they have.

2307
02:00:35,090 --> 02:00:36,800
That's all they know of themselves.
And they,

2308
02:00:36,810 --> 02:00:37,230
it,
they.

2309
02:00:37,230 --> 02:00:40,940
People have a very difficult time just
saying,

2310
02:00:40,970 --> 02:00:42,980
okay,
well those things are things that I'll

2311
02:00:42,981 --> 02:00:45,650
never do again.
I made these mistakes and now I'm this

2312
02:00:45,651 --> 02:00:48,500
person who's learned.
And that's a really hard jump for some

2313
02:00:48,501 --> 02:00:52,760
people because they need some sort of a
memory definition of their patterns of

2314
02:00:52,761 --> 02:00:55,910
behavior and when the memory definition,
when they look in their own memory and

2315
02:00:55,911 --> 02:01:00,230
everything is just failures and coming
up short and Mr Ren and car got

2316
02:01:00,231 --> 02:01:02,360
repossessed.
Those kinds of failures over and over

2317
02:01:02,361 --> 02:01:06,170
and over again stack up and you define
yourself by those failures and it

2318
02:01:06,171 --> 02:01:09,620
becomes really hard to move forward
because it's really hard for people and

2319
02:01:09,621 --> 02:01:14,540
so each little positive step that people
can do can be so significant because it

2320
02:01:14,570 --> 02:01:17,900
alters the course,
not just all like there was this Tony

2321
02:01:17,900 --> 02:01:19,000
Robbins thing once.
I hate them,

2322
02:01:19,220 --> 02:01:21,170
quote Tony Robbins.
It's got some really good quotes,

2323
02:01:21,620 --> 02:01:24,470
but one of the things he was talking
about was how it was just incremental

2324
02:01:24,471 --> 02:01:27,470
changes in your life.
So if you have two cars that are going

2325
02:01:27,471 --> 02:01:31,070
or two boats that are going in this
direction and one veers off course,

2326
02:01:31,100 --> 02:01:34,310
just five degrees.
Well if they both go 10 miles,

2327
02:01:34,490 --> 02:01:37,580
this one goes further and further and
further from the other one and it keeps

2328
02:01:37,581 --> 02:01:38,660
going further.
It's going,

2329
02:01:38,680 --> 02:01:39,950
it's it.
The course.

2330
02:01:40,100 --> 02:01:44,810
It changes the direction and MDM a
therapy or any sort of a psychedelic

2331
02:01:44,811 --> 02:01:49,811
experience that's boundary dissolving
and an ego dissolving and it just gets

2332
02:01:50,541 --> 02:01:54,260
to the raw heart of the matter and
allows you this really intense

2333
02:01:54,470 --> 02:01:56,780
perspective on it that's almost
unattainable.

2334
02:01:56,781 --> 02:02:00,860
Without those experiences.
Then that person leaves that and they

2335
02:02:00,861 --> 02:02:04,820
have almost like a fresh start in a
fresh understanding of who they are.

2336
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:09,620
They self defined differently and that
in itself is like a recipe for success.

2337
02:02:10,090 --> 02:02:14,320
Yeah.
There's this beautiful part of accepting

2338
02:02:14,321 --> 02:02:18,520
oneself and loving oneself.
Even with all of these failures.

2339
02:02:18,521 --> 02:02:21,700
Even with everything that's happened,
it's not that you deny that it happened

2340
02:02:21,701 --> 02:02:25,420
or you don't see it.
It's just this sense that you can relax

2341
02:02:25,421 --> 02:02:30,421
and feel that self love and that is
what's so rare and I think that's why

2342
02:02:31,630 --> 02:02:36,630
Mtma is one of the most popular illegal
drugs in the world and why it needs and

2343
02:02:39,311 --> 02:02:44,311
will become a madison and the reason
that I selected it is also because

2344
02:02:45,580 --> 02:02:49,420
training therapists reaching to the
mainstream so that when we talk about

2345
02:02:49,840 --> 02:02:53,350
how do we incorporate this as a madison,
it's with healers.

2346
02:02:53,351 --> 02:02:58,351
It's with doctors and therapists and I
think what we found is that we have FDA

2347
02:02:58,391 --> 02:03:02,890
permission for a study where we can
administer it to therapists and part of

2348
02:03:02,891 --> 02:03:05,260
our training program,
we're studying the psychological effects

2349
02:03:05,261 --> 02:03:08,890
of Mtma taken by healthy volunteers in a
therapeutic setting.

2350
02:03:09,640 --> 02:03:11,710
Wow.
And it's a double blind crossover,

2351
02:03:11,711 --> 02:03:15,100
placebo controlled study,
but we can bring in therapists from all

2352
02:03:15,101 --> 02:03:19,270
over the world and give them an MMA
session where they are the patient and

2353
02:03:19,271 --> 02:03:21,700
they're seeing our method of how to
deliver it.

2354
02:03:21,701 --> 02:03:26,230
And so Mtma is something that I think
will have a smoother,

2355
02:03:26,231 --> 02:03:31,231
easier way into psychiatry and into
psychotherapy because of it so gentle

2356
02:03:32,320 --> 02:03:36,280
because it isn't so much ego dissolving
as ego.

2357
02:03:36,281 --> 02:03:41,281
Clarifying your defenses are relaxed and
you can kind of accept yourself for who

2358
02:03:42,671 --> 02:03:47,671
you are so you can see more clearly and
then how you integrate that and how you

2359
02:03:48,460 --> 02:03:52,050
make it so that that affects your daily
life

2360
02:03:52,120 --> 02:03:54,100
afterwards.
I think it's really important.

2361
02:03:54,101 --> 02:03:56,230
You were saying about it being a magical
experience,

2362
02:03:56,320 --> 02:03:59,110
so one of the most manageable
experiences or all the psychedelics

2363
02:03:59,230 --> 02:04:01,000
because it feels really good.
Yeah.

2364
02:04:01,270 --> 02:04:03,070
Yeah.
It's not like you're going to have a bad

2365
02:04:03,071 --> 02:04:05,980
trip for the most part.
Although some of the veterans have said,

2366
02:04:05,981 --> 02:04:08,170
you know,
I don't know why they call this ecstasy.

2367
02:04:08,500 --> 02:04:10,810
Why do you say that?
Because they're going through this

2368
02:04:10,811 --> 02:04:13,050
trauma from their war.
So it's,

2369
02:04:13,051 --> 02:04:17,920
it's so even under the experience of
Mtma or under the influence of Mtma it

2370
02:04:17,921 --> 02:04:19,990
still,
they didn't like the fact that it was

2371
02:04:19,991 --> 02:04:21,280
bringing back those memories?

2372
02:04:21,570 --> 02:04:21,840
No,
no,

2373
02:04:21,840 --> 02:04:23,790
they liked it because that was her,
this healing.

2374
02:04:23,791 --> 02:04:26,850
But it was painful.
Sometimes it makes the pain bearable.

2375
02:04:26,851 --> 02:04:29,790
It doesn't make the pain go away or it
doesn't change your memory.

2376
02:04:29,791 --> 02:04:30,800
Like it didn't happen.

2377
02:04:30,940 --> 02:04:35,940
Well I suppose someone had board so you
really can't imagine what their

2378
02:04:35,981 --> 02:04:38,240
experiences are.
It

2379
02:04:38,240 --> 02:04:39,380
could be even worse,
you know,

2380
02:04:39,390 --> 02:04:42,750
childhood sexual abuse and you can't
trust your parents or you can't trust

2381
02:04:42,751 --> 02:04:44,250
your circumstances are.
Yeah.

2382
02:04:44,251 --> 02:04:45,750
It's all terrible.
Terrible.

2383
02:04:47,400 --> 02:04:51,600
Yeah.
And how people can get into these

2384
02:04:51,660 --> 02:04:53,160
patterns.
It's awful.

2385
02:04:53,430 --> 02:04:54,960
And,
and it seems like,

2386
02:04:55,390 --> 02:04:59,430
um,
through the technical Mtma is part of

2387
02:04:59,431 --> 02:05:02,970
the technologies appealing that it's one
of the things that we were talking about

2388
02:05:02,971 --> 02:05:06,600
with Jamie before this podcast started.
Before you got here,

2389
02:05:06,601 --> 02:05:11,310
we were saying how ridiculous it is that
it takes so long to get things passed

2390
02:05:11,430 --> 02:05:15,060
and that the government,
the dea is going to review marijuana in

2391
02:05:15,061 --> 02:05:18,510
July.
Well they have this thing in July.

2392
02:05:18,690 --> 02:05:19,051
Yeah.
Well,

2393
02:05:19,051 --> 02:05:22,530
they're going to say no and we've been
working to explain what they're gonna

2394
02:05:22,560 --> 02:05:26,400
say no to.
I believe that the request is that

2395
02:05:26,430 --> 02:05:29,100
marijuana be rescheduled from schedule
one to schedule two.

2396
02:05:29,770 --> 02:05:31,890
Um,
and that,

2397
02:05:32,160 --> 02:05:35,970
this rescheduling the framework,
if you don't mind,

2398
02:05:35,971 --> 02:05:38,040
could you explain what the difference
between scheduled ones because we're too

2399
02:05:38,110 --> 02:05:39,150
far from the point of view.

2400
02:05:39,240 --> 02:05:43,200
So the schedule one is the worst drugs
and they have no medicinal value,

2401
02:05:43,210 --> 02:05:46,680
no medicinal value.
There are no current,

2402
02:05:46,700 --> 02:05:50,400
they're not currently accepted medical
and there's no currently accepted safety

2403
02:05:50,401 --> 02:05:53,760
under medical supervision and no
currently accepted medical use and high

2404
02:05:53,761 --> 02:05:57,810
potential for abuse scheduled two drug
and these are the most heavily

2405
02:05:57,811 --> 02:06:02,811
criminalized drugs scheduled to except
for certain exceptions in schedule two,

2406
02:06:03,120 --> 02:06:05,670
which are also drugs with a high abuse
potential,

2407
02:06:05,671 --> 02:06:10,170
but have an accepted medical use like
methamphetamine and cocaine and cocaine

2408
02:06:10,350 --> 02:06:14,570
and heroin and heroin is not in the u s
but opiates,

2409
02:06:14,571 --> 02:06:16,770
all the opiates or heroin is illegal in
England,

2410
02:06:16,870 --> 02:06:19,680
but it's been blocked here.
So.

2411
02:06:19,720 --> 02:06:24,650
But oxycontin's are scheduled who every
medicine that you can get and scheduled

2412
02:06:24,651 --> 02:06:26,520
chats essentially the same as heroin.
Right?

2413
02:06:26,610 --> 02:06:29,250
Isn't it?
It's very sometimes more dangerous in

2414
02:06:29,251 --> 02:06:32,070
certain ways.
The psych psych,

2415
02:06:32,100 --> 02:06:32,933
it's a synthetic.

2416
02:06:32,940 --> 02:06:34,440
It has very similar.
Yes.

2417
02:06:34,490 --> 02:06:35,910
Affects.
Yeah,

2418
02:06:35,940 --> 02:06:39,980
but it has medical use for pain,
so moving from schedule one for

2419
02:06:39,990 --> 02:06:42,030
scheduled too.
There's been efforts to try to force the

2420
02:06:42,031 --> 02:06:45,030
dea to do this,
but the way the schedules are set up,

2421
02:06:45,031 --> 02:06:50,031
there has to be a currently accepted
medical use and the data is not there.

2422
02:06:50,161 --> 02:06:52,230
And you.
You talked before about you know,

2423
02:06:52,260 --> 02:06:54,120
when do you have enough anecdotal data
or.

2424
02:06:54,430 --> 02:06:58,800
I believe that we are so capable of
fooling ourselves into believing what we

2425
02:06:58,801 --> 02:07:01,890
want to believe and to seeing Jesus when
Jesus might not be there,

2426
02:07:01,950 --> 02:07:04,740
that we need science.
We should take marijuana through the

2427
02:07:04,741 --> 02:07:07,410
drug development system and we should
take the psychedelics.

2428
02:07:07,890 --> 02:07:10,740
It doesn't need to.
We were about to start a study with

2429
02:07:10,741 --> 02:07:12,990
marijuana.
I basically started trying to do drug

2430
02:07:12,991 --> 02:07:15,090
development research with marijuana in
1992.

2431
02:07:15,300 --> 02:07:20,300
This is the first time in 2016,
but since there's no established medical

2432
02:07:20,971 --> 02:07:24,660
benefits of marijuana that had been
proven in any scientific way.

2433
02:07:25,140 --> 02:07:27,840
Yes,
there's been a lot of evidence in phase

2434
02:07:27,841 --> 02:07:32,841
two pilot studies,
but the definition of real proof is

2435
02:07:33,091 --> 02:07:37,150
phase three studies these large scale
studies that you work and negotiate with

2436
02:07:37,900 --> 02:07:42,220
Fda for the marijuana plant.
Now gw pharmaceuticals is a company in

2437
02:07:42,221 --> 02:07:45,190
England that grows marijuana,
it takes extracts,

2438
02:07:45,670 --> 02:07:48,820
sativex it's a teaching and cbd
combination and a pill.

2439
02:07:49,120 --> 02:07:54,120
And then they also have epidiolex which
is cbd for childhood epilepsy.

2440
02:07:54,580 --> 02:07:57,850
So they are in phase three studies.
So there are people working with

2441
02:07:57,851 --> 02:08:02,650
marijuana extracts in different
nonsmoking delivery systems going

2442
02:08:02,651 --> 02:08:07,651
through the system.
But the plant itself is highly

2443
02:08:07,721 --> 02:08:10,360
effective.
It doesn't cause lung cancer if you

2444
02:08:10,361 --> 02:08:12,610
smoke it,
if you vaporize it,

2445
02:08:12,670 --> 02:08:16,000
um,
it's even less irritating to lungs.

2446
02:08:16,480 --> 02:08:21,480
And there's the possibility that a low
cost plant in Israel right now,

2447
02:08:24,641 --> 02:08:27,850
they grow high potency trimmed buds for
fifty cents a gram,

2448
02:08:27,880 --> 02:08:29,050
$14 an ounce.

2449
02:08:29,410 --> 02:08:33,970
So I think there's public benefit in
making the marijuana plant in smoked or

2450
02:08:33,971 --> 02:08:38,971
vaporized form into a madison available
paid for by insurance as a alternative

2451
02:08:40,061 --> 02:08:43,870
to all these other medicines.
But there is no effort right now.

2452
02:08:44,050 --> 02:08:47,140
We're starting it.
Six years ago we started a study for

2453
02:08:47,141 --> 02:08:51,530
marijuana for ptsd and veterans,
so we've talked about Mtma and the idea

2454
02:08:51,531 --> 02:08:53,920
is to help people with a few MTMA
sessions,

2455
02:08:53,921 --> 02:08:55,660
not need Mtma,
not need drugs,

2456
02:08:56,230 --> 02:08:59,890
sort of reorganize their brain,
but there's a lot of people with ptsd

2457
02:09:00,160 --> 02:09:02,920
that find marijuana to be helpful if
they don't have the nightmares,

2458
02:09:02,921 --> 02:09:05,830
they're more present focused and they're
thinking,

2459
02:09:05,890 --> 02:09:10,210
well maybe I don't want to do this Mtma
or maybe it's a supplement.

2460
02:09:10,360 --> 02:09:13,840
So there's never been a study of
marijuana for PTSD.

2461
02:09:14,230 --> 02:09:19,230
There's been a lots and lots of
anecdotal reports,

2462
02:09:19,780 --> 02:09:20,770
hundreds,
you know,

2463
02:09:21,100 --> 02:09:23,860
thousands of people saying that it's
helpful in different ways,

2464
02:09:24,160 --> 02:09:28,480
but marijuana is a palliative meaning
that it just treats the symptoms and

2465
02:09:28,481 --> 02:09:30,070
it's used usually everyday.

2466
02:09:30,400 --> 02:09:33,970
So it's taken us six years.
We're about to start the study and it

2467
02:09:33,971 --> 02:09:36,970
will take us another several years to
finish it.

2468
02:09:37,740 --> 02:09:41,530
I'm part of it will be at Johns Hopkins,
part of it will be an Arizona at 76

2469
02:09:41,531 --> 02:09:44,830
veterans with chronic treatment
resistant ptsd and retesting one sample

2470
02:09:44,831 --> 02:09:47,110
that's high thc,
one that's high cbd,

2471
02:09:47,440 --> 02:09:52,150
one that's kind of thc cbd combination.
And then one placebo and we've got a two

2472
02:09:52,151 --> 02:09:54,460
point $1,000,000 grant from the state of
Colorado,

2473
02:09:54,880 --> 02:09:59,170
Colorado to do this study and it's going
to be a definitive thing.

2474
02:09:59,171 --> 02:10:01,000
And because again,
we're nonprofit,

2475
02:10:01,001 --> 02:10:04,390
we're giving away the protocol,
there's no intellectual property like

2476
02:10:04,391 --> 02:10:06,670
that.
And so there's a for profit company,

2477
02:10:06,860 --> 02:10:11,460
private privateer that actually has
bought them early brand and they have a

2478
02:10:12,040 --> 02:10:15,640
medical marijuana company,
venture capital and they have um,

2479
02:10:15,900 --> 02:10:17,530
hustle,
Arius Tilray,

02:10:17,590 --> 02:10:22,390
which is a big production of marijuana
production factory in British Columbia.

2481
02:10:22,540 --> 02:10:26,860
Supplies like 5,000 patients.
They're owned by private tier and we've

2482
02:10:26,861 --> 02:10:30,160
given them our marijuana protocol and so
they're going to use the study with our

2483
02:10:30,161 --> 02:10:32,380
study,
does with the same study design but with

2484
02:10:32,381 --> 02:10:34,610
their marijuana and they're going to
vaporize and they're going to,

2485
02:10:34,880 --> 02:10:37,520
we're going to smoke.
And then there's a new study starting in

2486
02:10:37,521 --> 02:10:40,760
Australia.
There's this guy who's grandchild had

2487
02:10:41,060 --> 02:10:45,140
pediatric epilepsy and nothing helped.
And then they tried to cbd and it

2488
02:10:45,200 --> 02:10:48,230
stopped the epileptic seizures to a
great extent.

2489
02:10:48,231 --> 02:10:52,550
And then the father donated 33 million
to the University of Sydney for cannabis

2490
02:10:52,551 --> 02:10:54,950
research.
It's the largest grant in the history of

2491
02:10:54,951 --> 02:10:58,040
the University of Sydney,
so they're going to take our protocol

2492
02:10:58,250 --> 02:11:03,250
and they're going to get marijuana from
tilray but put into capsules as edibles.

2493
02:11:03,770 --> 02:11:06,200
So we're going to have three different
studies,

2494
02:11:06,580 --> 02:11:09,590
um,
similar in design,

2495
02:11:09,591 --> 02:11:12,080
but smoked,
vaporized and edibles.

2496
02:11:12,140 --> 02:11:17,140
We're going to combine the data and so
this is the scientific process,

2497
02:11:18,620 --> 02:11:19,610
but it'll take us.

2498
02:11:19,610 --> 02:11:21,470
It's taken us six years so far just to
get the study,

2499
02:11:21,471 --> 02:11:23,750
even started the study will be three
years,

2500
02:11:24,170 --> 02:11:27,350
then we'll learn from it and we'd
probably need to do another three,

2501
02:11:27,351 --> 02:11:29,600
four years,
study a phase three because this is just

2502
02:11:29,601 --> 02:11:31,610
phase two.
And in the meantime we have to break the

2503
02:11:31,611 --> 02:11:34,790
government monopoly on marijuana because
in the US we're stuck with the

2504
02:11:34,791 --> 02:11:38,690
government marijuana and explain that.
Well,

2505
02:11:39,320 --> 02:11:44,320
the police in 1968,
andy while actually at Harvard wanted to

2506
02:11:44,731 --> 02:11:47,840
do study with marijuana.
And so the federal government started

2507
02:11:47,841 --> 02:11:51,170
with farm at the University of
Mississippi to grow marijuana for

2508
02:11:51,171 --> 02:11:56,171
research.
And ever since then the National

2509
02:11:56,690 --> 02:11:57,950
Institute of Drug Abuse has contracts
now.

2510
02:11:57,980 --> 02:12:00,170
And so the University of Mississippi,
a professor,

2511
02:12:00,171 --> 02:12:02,420
I'll solely.
It is now in charge,

2512
02:12:02,630 --> 02:12:07,630
they're the only federally licensed dea
licensed marijuana in America and the

2513
02:12:07,671 --> 02:12:12,230
FDA is a federal agency so it can only
work with drugs that are federally

2514
02:12:12,231 --> 02:12:12,920
legal.

2515
02:12:12,920 --> 02:12:16,820
So the only source of marijuana in
America that can be used in clinical

2516
02:12:16,821 --> 02:12:21,080
research is this marijuana controlled by
the nationalist on drug abuse,

2517
02:12:21,081 --> 02:12:26,081
which has been anti marijuana with this
contract with the University of

2518
02:12:26,120 --> 02:12:29,450
Mississippi.
And we have tried maps as tried starting

2519
02:12:29,451 --> 02:12:34,451
in 2000 to break this monopoly and we
submitted a application in 2001 with

2520
02:12:35,151 --> 02:12:40,151
Professor Lyle craker at Umass amherst.
And we won a dea administrative law

2521
02:12:40,281 --> 02:12:42,800
judge lawsuit the second time I've sued
the dea in one,

2522
02:12:43,370 --> 02:12:47,180
but in the end they ignore the judges.
They ignore the science and the politics

2523
02:12:47,600 --> 02:12:51,170
takes over and so,
and we lost in the appeals court in

2524
02:12:51,171 --> 02:12:53,870
2013.
So the way I described that,

2525
02:12:53,871 --> 02:12:56,660
we have this 960 grams of super pure
Mtma,

2526
02:12:56,661 --> 02:12:58,970
but it's not the appeal.
The government.

2527
02:12:59,660 --> 02:13:01,040
What did they say when they were
appealing?

2528
02:13:01,250 --> 02:13:02,720
They said that,
um,

2529
02:13:03,380 --> 02:13:05,330
that the government had an adequate
supply.

2530
02:13:07,010 --> 02:13:09,860
What does that mean for everybody in all
research or the research?

2531
02:13:09,861 --> 02:13:11,420
Yeah.
We show that they didn't have what we

2532
02:13:11,421 --> 02:13:15,070
needed and also meaning that the,
um,

2533
02:13:15,140 --> 02:13:18,470
there has to be an adequate and
uninterrupted did supply produced under

2534
02:13:18,471 --> 02:13:20,900
adequately competitive conditions?
Well,

2535
02:13:20,901 --> 02:13:24,470
also did you factor in the fact of the
different strains have different

2536
02:13:24,710 --> 02:13:26,210
responses?
Yeah.

2537
02:13:26,330 --> 02:13:27,680
Yeah,
that's it.

2538
02:13:27,700 --> 02:13:30,520
That's why we're using these,
you know,

2539
02:13:30,680 --> 02:13:31,530
different,
right.

2540
02:13:31,531 --> 02:13:32,540
But the government,
did they,

2541
02:13:33,450 --> 02:13:35,190
do,
they understand that there's different

2542
02:13:35,250 --> 02:13:37,380
strains are associated with different
feelings.

2543
02:13:37,920 --> 02:13:40,410
Only recently have they had any CBD
available.

2544
02:13:40,440 --> 02:13:45,440
So gw pharmaceuticals started in 1998.
Combining saddleback's was thc and CBD.

2545
02:13:47,580 --> 02:13:51,630
It was up until just last year that they
had the US government could provide

2546
02:13:51,631 --> 02:13:55,680
marijuana with cbd in it.
They've not been focused on making these

2547
02:13:55,681 --> 02:13:59,370
things into medicines.
It's more low potency research into the

2548
02:13:59,371 --> 02:14:04,371
risks of marijuana and it's the final
next step in the medical marijuana story

2549
02:14:04,980 --> 02:14:09,980
is to end the obstruction on privately
funded drug development research,

2550
02:14:11,641 --> 02:14:13,290
trying to make the plant into a madison.

2551
02:14:13,320 --> 02:14:16,350
And that's what I'm,
ironically,

2552
02:14:17,040 --> 02:14:21,120
it's easier to do research with
psychedelics than with marijuana to try

2553
02:14:21,121 --> 02:14:25,230
to make it into a madison because we
control our drug.

2554
02:14:25,410 --> 02:14:28,140
So I'm getting a,
a GMP Mtma I,

2555
02:14:28,380 --> 02:14:31,680
it's the same stuff we're going to use
in phase three that we want to market.

2556
02:14:32,100 --> 02:14:36,030
But the federal government,
marijuana can only be used in research.

2557
02:14:36,420 --> 02:14:39,600
It can't be marketed and because the
strains are all so different,

2558
02:14:39,601 --> 02:14:43,950
we can't show marijuana helps for ptsd
with one strain and then just say,

2559
02:14:43,951 --> 02:14:45,810
oh,
give us approval for any other strain.

2560
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:48,210
Right?
So we need to use this.

2561
02:14:48,270 --> 02:14:50,580
And this is the true for FDA,
for other botanicals.

2562
02:14:50,581 --> 02:14:52,770
If you're going to do a study in
botanical medicines,

2563
02:14:52,830 --> 02:14:55,080
those phase three study needs to be with
the same,

2564
02:14:55,650 --> 02:14:57,660
uh,
consistent batch that you want to

2565
02:14:57,661 --> 02:14:58,381
market.
Well,

2566
02:14:58,381 --> 02:15:03,030
I guess this is all important because we
want the same sort of stringent process

2567
02:15:03,031 --> 02:15:07,200
to be taking place for a drug safer
arthritis or something like that.

2568
02:15:07,200 --> 02:15:10,530
Like there's so many drugs that have
been gone through clinical trials and

2569
02:15:10,531 --> 02:15:13,230
wind up still,
even after all that being dangerous.

2570
02:15:13,710 --> 02:15:16,140
But the problem with this is that we
know it's not dangerous.

2571
02:15:16,141 --> 02:15:19,020
It's not like there's any question
whatsoever about whether or not it's

2572
02:15:19,021 --> 02:15:20,070
hurting anybody.
Yes,

2573
02:15:20,071 --> 02:15:24,510
and what I'm basically saying is about
insurance and a science so that it

2574
02:15:24,511 --> 02:15:25,890
should be.
What I'm saying is marijuana should be

2575
02:15:25,891 --> 02:15:28,440
legal right away.
Of course people should be able to get

2576
02:15:28,441 --> 02:15:30,990
this.
The process that we're trying to go

2577
02:15:30,991 --> 02:15:35,310
through with making the marijuana plant
into a medicine is solving the

2578
02:15:35,311 --> 02:15:38,970
fundamental issue that all of these
medical marijuana states that have

2579
02:15:38,971 --> 02:15:41,850
approved medical marijuana laws,
the patients have to buy the medicine

2580
02:15:41,851 --> 02:15:44,550
themselves.
They don't get it covered by insurance.

2581
02:15:45,270 --> 02:15:49,080
That'll only happen when you go through
the FDA and you've made it federally

2582
02:15:49,081 --> 02:15:53,820
legal.
So the intention is to make it so that

2583
02:15:53,821 --> 02:15:58,050
people can get their medicine so that
they can get it paid for by insurance.

2584
02:15:58,050 --> 02:15:59,340
Is that the intention?
Yeah,

2585
02:15:59,670 --> 02:16:01,260
it's like a medicine,
right?

2586
02:16:01,560 --> 02:16:04,200
I mean,
and so the way to do that is to make it

2587
02:16:04,201 --> 02:16:06,750
federally illegal.
That's the best pathway you think the

2588
02:16:06,751 --> 02:16:08,520
federal legalization.
Well,

2589
02:16:08,521 --> 02:16:11,850
I think by I'm talking about fairly
legalized for medicine,

2590
02:16:12,530 --> 02:16:16,500
so to go through the FDA process then
insurance companies,

2591
02:16:17,640 --> 02:16:21,810
I mean they couldn't be doing studies
now and look at the fact that people are

2592
02:16:21,811 --> 02:16:26,460
using marijuana instead of a lot of more
expensive pharmaceutical medications and

2593
02:16:26,461 --> 02:16:28,470
that from an insurance company point of
view,

2594
02:16:28,500 --> 02:16:33,500
it could be wise to subsidize marijuana
right now it just hasn't happened yet.

2595
02:16:34,751 --> 02:16:37,690
As far as I'm aware that insurance
companies in Canada,

2596
02:16:37,930 --> 02:16:41,390
the Canadian government pays for medical
marijuana for veterans,

2597
02:16:42,190 --> 02:16:44,110
CSD.
The Canadian government pays for that.

2598
02:16:44,140 --> 02:16:46,870
Even though there's been no science are
these studies that are.

2599
02:16:46,930 --> 02:16:51,460
These three studies will be the first on
marijuana for Ptsd controlled studies

2600
02:16:52,660 --> 02:16:57,660
and so there's the likelihood that once
we make it into an FDA approved

2601
02:16:59,261 --> 02:17:01,840
medicine,
insurance companies will then be

2602
02:17:02,590 --> 02:17:07,000
willing,
now it's federally legal to cover it as

2603
02:17:07,001 --> 02:17:10,720
a medicine for what has been proved to
be particularly if it saves them money

2604
02:17:10,721 --> 02:17:11,680
on other medicines.

2605
02:17:11,800 --> 02:17:13,900
So that's the cultural.
Of course.

2606
02:17:13,901 --> 02:17:15,960
Then the pharmaceutical drug companies
are gonna.

2607
02:17:15,990 --> 02:17:18,520
There's gonna be a bounce back there.
It's all really.

2608
02:17:18,521 --> 02:17:21,280
The only thing that's holding us back is
this nutty system that we have right now

2609
02:17:21,281 --> 02:17:25,390
that's so complicated to make something
as harmless as marijuana become legal.

2610
02:17:25,460 --> 02:17:28,090
Well,
well the system has been blocked.

2611
02:17:28,240 --> 02:17:30,010
The system itself,
when it's unblocked,

2612
02:17:30,011 --> 02:17:32,630
isn't really that long.
You just talked about how okay,

2613
02:17:32,830 --> 02:17:37,690
civil war wasn't that long with with
psychedelics.

2614
02:17:38,060 --> 02:17:42,370
I mean part of it is also resources.
Do we have the resources to fund the

2615
02:17:42,371 --> 02:17:44,410
studies,
but in 1992,

2616
02:17:44,411 --> 02:17:49,411
the FDA had an advisory committee
meeting that was about what to do about

2617
02:17:50,111 --> 02:17:52,840
medical marijuana and what to do about
psychedelics and should they be

2618
02:17:52,841 --> 02:17:56,290
permitted to be studied as medicines.
This was in 1992 the,

2619
02:17:56,291 --> 02:17:59,440
so there'd been roughly 20 years of
suppression of research crackdown.

2620
02:17:59,470 --> 02:18:02,950
After the sixties,
the FDA had this advisory committee

2621
02:18:02,960 --> 02:18:04,540
meeting.
The National Institute of Drug Abuse

2622
02:18:04,541 --> 02:18:07,840
convened a meeting of their animal
researchers doing studies on

2623
02:18:08,200 --> 02:18:11,020
psychedelics and other drugs in animal
models trying to figure out what they

2624
02:18:11,021 --> 02:18:12,970
do.
They recommend that human use.

2625
02:18:13,030 --> 02:18:18,030
The advisory committee recommended that
human research be resumed and the FDA

2626
02:18:18,041 --> 02:18:23,041
adopted that so that we've actually had
this open door with a research at the

2627
02:18:23,891 --> 02:18:28,510
FDA if we had the resources except for
marijuana because marijuana was

2628
02:18:28,511 --> 02:18:30,670
controlled by the nationalist and of
drug abuse.

2629
02:18:30,671 --> 02:18:33,190
We had broken that.
We'd gotten her own supplies of

2630
02:18:33,191 --> 02:18:35,620
psychedelics after,
as their own supplies of psilocybin.

2631
02:18:36,460 --> 02:18:40,630
So now
the system takes,

2632
02:18:40,700 --> 02:18:44,200
um,
six to 10 years,

2633
02:18:45,190 --> 02:18:47,590
something like that,
of doing the research.

2634
02:18:47,591 --> 02:18:50,080
Once you have a drug that you think does
something to,

2635
02:18:50,130 --> 02:18:53,170
to prove it,
and that is take some time and it costs

2636
02:18:53,171 --> 02:18:56,350
a lot of money,
but it doesn't cost billions like the

2637
02:18:56,440 --> 02:18:57,970
pharmaceutical company will tell you.

2638
02:18:58,030 --> 02:18:59,350
I mean,
we're actually,

2639
02:18:59,810 --> 02:19:04,390
I'm able to make md man to a medicine in
part because it's a demonized drug

2640
02:19:04,480 --> 02:19:07,300
because it's ecstasy.
Governments over the world have spent

2641
02:19:07,301 --> 02:19:11,230
over $300,000,000,
probably more by now on research with

2642
02:19:11,231 --> 02:19:13,180
Mtma.
If you go into the scientific literature

2643
02:19:13,181 --> 02:19:15,640
and medline and you put in Mtma or
ecstasy,

2644
02:19:15,641 --> 02:19:19,480
there's over 5,000 papers.
A lot of science has been done but we

2645
02:19:19,481 --> 02:19:24,481
haven't had to pay for about the risks,
but even then when we sort of take that

2646
02:19:25,511 --> 02:19:29,240
and then do the kind of studies that we
needed to do with psychedelics,

2647
02:19:29,810 --> 02:19:34,190
it,
it feels like the system is takes time

2648
02:19:34,191 --> 02:19:36,650
to prove it,
but we are so good at tricking ourselves

2649
02:19:36,680 --> 02:19:40,040
and there is something to be said for
this process.

2650
02:19:40,580 --> 02:19:43,970
And so I think when we talk about how
come marijuana is into Madison,

2651
02:19:43,971 --> 02:19:48,971
part of it is that the process has been
gummed up for 50 years and is still

2652
02:19:49,581 --> 02:19:51,650
gummed up by this last step.

2653
02:19:51,680 --> 02:19:55,640
I mean there was another step that to
get access to this federal marijuana,

2654
02:19:55,940 --> 02:20:00,940
you had to have a public health service
review that was created in 1999 because

2655
02:20:01,911 --> 02:20:04,850
before that they only gave the marijuana
to government researchers.

2656
02:20:04,851 --> 02:20:06,500
You,
you couldn't even do your own funded

2657
02:20:06,501 --> 02:20:09,470
study with marijuana through the FDA
because you couldn't get the marijuana.

2658
02:20:09,471 --> 02:20:11,690
It was only for their researchers.
Ninety nine.

2659
02:20:11,691 --> 02:20:15,830
They created this policy that would open
it up in their minds,

2660
02:20:15,831 --> 02:20:18,700
but there was a special review in
addition to FDA.

2661
02:20:18,701 --> 02:20:22,460
Dea and Irb that,
that we just were able to succeed in

2662
02:20:22,461 --> 02:20:25,640
getting them to eliminate the Obama
administration eliminated it last

2663
02:20:25,640 --> 02:20:27,050
summer,
this public health service review.

2664
02:20:27,051 --> 02:20:30,290
It's what blocked our marijuana ptsd
study for years and years.

2665
02:20:30,710 --> 02:20:33,500
That's gone.
The last thing to get gone is this

2666
02:20:33,501 --> 02:20:36,380
government monopoly on marijuana and
we're working.

2667
02:20:36,381 --> 02:20:39,740
We're planning to resubmit an
application from professor craker.

2668
02:20:39,770 --> 02:20:43,400
We're working with Covington and burling
and big DC law firm taking the case pro

2669
02:20:43,401 --> 02:20:48,401
bono to um,
do a legal analysis and then we will try

2670
02:20:50,810 --> 02:20:53,600
to persuade.
We were working with Senator Gillibrand

2671
02:20:53,601 --> 02:20:58,601
and Senator Warren and others have been
engaging the dea and on DCP,

2672
02:20:58,941 --> 02:21:01,190
hhs,
human in discussions about this

2673
02:21:01,191 --> 02:21:03,980
monopoly.
There's growing support in Congress and

2674
02:21:03,981 --> 02:21:08,981
this is the last vestige of a sort of
politics blocking the science with

2675
02:21:09,711 --> 02:21:14,210
psychedelics or marijuana.
Then the system will have to work with

2676
02:21:14,360 --> 02:21:18,440
and in the meantime people can go around
and legalize and then that gets access.

2677
02:21:18,441 --> 02:21:21,590
And so we're not saying,
wait for the science to.

2678
02:21:21,830 --> 02:21:23,990
Well,
do you have any fear with the upcoming

2679
02:21:24,290 --> 02:21:26,000
elections?
Do you have any fear?

2680
02:21:26,001 --> 02:21:28,790
If we go right wing,
that there might be some blowback.

2681
02:21:29,060 --> 02:21:32,000
Yeah,
I mean I fearful that all the time.

2682
02:21:32,001 --> 02:21:32,780
I mean,
my,

2683
02:21:32,780 --> 02:21:37,780
my sort of core imprint was that in 1971
I first took lsd in 1972.

2684
02:21:38,700 --> 02:21:40,820
You know,
I decided that this was what I wanted to

2685
02:21:40,821 --> 02:21:45,020
devote my life to and I looked around
and I saw all the research has been shut

2686
02:21:45,021 --> 02:21:46,100
down.
I,

2687
02:21:46,140 --> 02:21:50,150
I sort of came in one year after the big
sweeping prohibition.

2688
02:21:50,180 --> 02:21:53,390
I woke up to it not when it was
thriving,

2689
02:21:53,391 --> 02:21:58,310
but right after the backlash.
That's why I think I was so motivated to

2690
02:21:58,311 --> 02:22:01,010
get involved with Mtma because I learned
about md may 19,

2691
02:22:01,011 --> 02:22:04,850
82 when it was an underground
psychedelic psychotherapy tool under the

2692
02:22:04,851 --> 02:22:07,580
code name Adam,
that the government had no knowledge of

2693
02:22:07,660 --> 02:22:10,040
in Dallas.
This was at Dallas.

2694
02:22:10,041 --> 02:22:13,580
I know Dallas is where Adam Mtma turned
into ecstasy,

2695
02:22:13,940 --> 02:22:16,100
so that's where they started selling it
above ground.

2696
02:22:16,130 --> 02:22:18,310
There's an incredible movie that's going
to come out,

2697
02:22:18,320 --> 02:22:22,430
the stork club about the club in Dallas
where it really got well known,

2698
02:22:22,460 --> 02:22:26,850
but it because it had this dual life,
one as this quiet underground therapy

2699
02:22:26,851 --> 02:22:31,830
drug with about half a million doses
having been used by around 1984 and then

2700
02:22:31,831 --> 02:22:35,580
the other was this public ecstasy use.
I thought,

2701
02:22:35,581 --> 02:22:37,530
okay,
now I know about it ahead of time.

2702
02:22:37,531 --> 02:22:40,950
I can see the crackdown coming.
Everybody could see the crackdown

2703
02:22:40,980 --> 02:22:42,630
coming,
but now we can organize.

2704
02:22:42,660 --> 02:22:45,870
Now we can have.
We can talk to people about it.

2705
02:22:45,871 --> 02:22:49,290
It's not a crime where we can gather our
forces and have people try it even,

2706
02:22:50,070 --> 02:22:53,560
and that's where I became really
politically

2707
02:22:53,930 --> 02:22:56,720
involved in the eighties.
Well,

2708
02:22:56,880 --> 02:23:01,880
it's just amazing how long it's taken,
but it's amazing that you have the

2709
02:23:01,881 --> 02:23:06,650
fortitude to push through for so long.
I mean the world,

2710
02:23:07,820 --> 02:23:10,700
the world and the consciousness of the
people.

2711
02:23:10,701 --> 02:23:12,350
Oh,
you guys a massive debt.

2712
02:23:12,890 --> 02:23:16,760
I mean a debt of gratitude for sure that
you've been out there pushing this

2713
02:23:16,761 --> 02:23:21,050
envelope and and chipping away.
It's like one of many weapons chipping

2714
02:23:21,051 --> 02:23:24,530
at this wall of ignorance,
but maps is a really powerful one.

2715
02:23:25,430 --> 02:23:28,350
And,
and we've been able to do it in a way

2716
02:23:28,351 --> 02:23:33,351
where right now we have two senior
retired FDA officials who are acting as

2717
02:23:34,351 --> 02:23:39,351
our consultants to prepare our documents
because they felt that there is a strong

2718
02:23:40,141 --> 02:23:44,010
need for new treatments for ptsd.
I mean they don't necessarily or saying

2719
02:23:44,011 --> 02:23:47,370
anything about cultural change or
spirituality or drug war.

2720
02:23:47,371 --> 02:23:50,580
There's this first soldiers just for
some other people,

2721
02:23:50,610 --> 02:23:55,110
everybody with ptsd that they,
they have watched over the last 15,

2722
02:23:55,111 --> 02:23:58,890
20 years what we've done.
And actually there's a woman on our

2723
02:23:58,891 --> 02:24:03,330
staff Ilsa Jerome that isn't been
reviewing all these papers,

2724
02:24:03,331 --> 02:24:07,710
all these 5,000 papers and developing
what's called a in conjunction with

2725
02:24:07,711 --> 02:24:09,810
other members of our team,
uh,

2726
02:24:10,860 --> 02:24:14,430
a investigator's brochure,
a summary of the literature with a risk

2727
02:24:14,431 --> 02:24:18,330
benefit calculation.
How you take all of this information.

2728
02:24:18,331 --> 02:24:20,970
And then what does it mean in terms of
the risks that you present to the

2729
02:24:20,971 --> 02:24:25,971
patients in the study and that you tell
the doctors and the people at the FDA

2730
02:24:27,211 --> 02:24:30,360
thought that we were doing it fairly in
a,

2731
02:24:30,450 --> 02:24:33,750
in a time when it was being distorted
and all these different ways and Elsa is

2732
02:24:33,751 --> 02:24:38,580
actually a little bit more conservative
than I am and I knew that it was kind of

2733
02:24:38,581 --> 02:24:42,990
good to let her take the lead and
writing this and that it got the respect

2734
02:24:42,991 --> 02:24:43,740
of the FDA.

2735
02:24:43,740 --> 02:24:46,440
So that's where I'm

2736
02:24:47,320 --> 02:24:52,320
hopeful that isn't it kind of strange
that a mtma being used to treat ptsd is

2737
02:24:52,890 --> 02:24:57,890
a primary motivating factor for the
federal government trying to make it

2738
02:24:58,120 --> 02:24:59,620
legal.
Because if you think about it,

2739
02:25:00,160 --> 02:25:04,000
ptsd,
PTSD is inexorably associated with war.

2740
02:25:04,220 --> 02:25:05,053
Yeah.
So,

2741
02:25:05,160 --> 02:25:10,160
so in some sort of strange way,
war was responsible for accelerating the

2742
02:25:11,771 --> 02:25:14,980
legalization of Mtma,
which is really fucking crazy.

2743
02:25:15,340 --> 02:25:20,340
I mean that is like the Yin and Yang in
like a bio mechanical form,

2744
02:25:20,730 --> 02:25:22,870
you know,
that's a kito yeah,

2745
02:25:22,970 --> 02:25:25,240
that's crazy.
If you really look at what that is.

2746
02:25:25,350 --> 02:25:26,183
Yeah.
No,

2747
02:25:26,280 --> 02:25:27,520
no.
We've also though,

2748
02:25:27,521 --> 02:25:31,120
what about the other,
the next step does we've been accused of

2749
02:25:31,150 --> 02:25:33,790
by our people have raised the cautionary
tale,

2750
02:25:34,210 --> 02:25:36,880
which I disagree with,
but they've said some people have said,

2751
02:25:37,930 --> 02:25:42,930
are you making it more easy to wage now
or if you are reducing the costs of war,

2752
02:25:45,220 --> 02:25:46,930
are you making war?

2753
02:25:46,960 --> 02:25:50,590
It's convoluted,
more likely have an option and I think

2754
02:25:50,591 --> 02:25:55,591
it's a worthwhile question to ask it.
It applies to all medical doctors that

2755
02:25:56,981 --> 02:26:01,981
worked for the military surgeons you
know are are you by treating people,

2756
02:26:03,101 --> 02:26:07,630
making it easier for there to be.
I think that's a very narrow

2757
02:26:07,660 --> 02:26:09,730
perspective.
It's a very narrow perspective and it's

2758
02:26:09,731 --> 02:26:14,731
also not taking into consideration the
actual psychoactive effects of that

2759
02:26:15,431 --> 02:26:17,800
substance because that's substance make
someone loving.

2760
02:26:18,100 --> 02:26:22,690
So if you think that giving out pills
that make you more loving or more likely

2761
02:26:22,691 --> 02:26:25,390
going to generate more war or make more
and more palatable,

2762
02:26:25,391 --> 02:26:28,750
I think the opposite is probably true.
I think the people who become more

2763
02:26:28,751 --> 02:26:32,920
loving who can relay the experiences of
the horrors of war to other people who

2764
02:26:32,921 --> 02:26:35,800
become more loving because they also get
a hold of this stuff,

2765
02:26:36,100 --> 02:26:40,450
then I think that's more likely to
eliminate war or lesson war or at least

2766
02:26:40,451 --> 02:26:44,740
mitigated significantly because I think
that war is probably mitigated

2767
02:26:44,741 --> 02:26:47,920
significant significantly now in
comparison to like the sheer numbers of

2768
02:26:47,921 --> 02:26:50,210
people like in comparison to,
you know,

2769
02:26:50,470 --> 02:26:52,300
500 years ago,
600 years ago.

2770
02:26:52,480 --> 02:26:54,300
It's probably way less war.
Yeah.

2771
02:26:54,400 --> 02:26:57,020
I just watched a lexus fella,
steven pinker just to.

2772
02:26:57,060 --> 02:26:59,740
Yes,
was very interesting about the reduction

2773
02:26:59,741 --> 02:27:01,300
of violence or the.
Well,

2774
02:27:01,301 --> 02:27:05,050
it's way easier.
It's way safer and I think that things

2775
02:27:05,051 --> 02:27:10,051
like psychedelic drugs in particular,
but also the meditative techniques,

2776
02:27:11,230 --> 02:27:16,230
focusing on being in the moment,
focusing on learning how to manage your

2777
02:27:17,141 --> 02:27:21,620
mind and there's a lot of things that
people are practicing and attempting to

2778
02:27:21,650 --> 02:27:25,850
to use in their everyday life today.
Mindfulness and it's,

2779
02:27:26,170 --> 02:27:28,630
it's,
it's a subject that's repeated very

2780
02:27:28,631 --> 02:27:32,620
often and people are trying to find a
better way of approaching different

2781
02:27:32,621 --> 02:27:36,010
dilemmas in their life and this is a
tool for those things.

2782
02:27:36,040 --> 02:27:39,310
It's a tool for those things that should
be considered alongside of yoga,

2783
02:27:39,550 --> 02:27:41,950
alongside of meditation,
alongside of Reading,

2784
02:27:41,951 --> 02:27:44,470
self help,
books alongside of having good friends

2785
02:27:44,471 --> 02:27:47,440
you can open up with and you can discuss
things together and get encouragement

2786
02:27:47,441 --> 02:27:51,010
from each other and and maybe even
criticism from each other and all those

2787
02:27:51,011 --> 02:27:54,580
things exist in,
in all sorts of different forums and

2788
02:27:54,581 --> 02:27:56,410
they exist in psychedelics as well.

2789
02:27:57,040 --> 02:27:59,980
A lot of the times.
I mean especially I find eating

2790
02:27:59,981 --> 02:28:04,000
marijuana to be one of the most self
analyzing,

2791
02:28:04,090 --> 02:28:07,330
objective,
introspective experiences you can have.

2792
02:28:07,331 --> 02:28:10,420
It's like a real wake up call to any
holes you might have in your game.

2793
02:28:10,421 --> 02:28:13,750
It just smacks you in the place and
sends you back out there in the world.

2794
02:28:13,751 --> 02:28:14,321
You're like,
shit,

2795
02:28:14,321 --> 02:28:15,001
okay,
I got it.

2796
02:28:15,001 --> 02:28:15,834
I got it.
I got it.

2797
02:28:16,030 --> 02:28:20,170
Those are tools and there's a.
they're all tools that can be used in a

2798
02:28:20,171 --> 02:28:23,270
variety of different ways,
but to deny the fact that they can be

2799
02:28:23,271 --> 02:28:27,950
used beneficially at this point is
really silly because we are finite

2800
02:28:27,951 --> 02:28:29,900
beings.
We live a short amount of time.

2801
02:28:29,901 --> 02:28:33,350
Wouldn't it be nice if you got rid of
most of your bullshit by the time you

2802
02:28:33,351 --> 02:28:34,420
hit add?
Yeah.

2803
02:28:34,470 --> 02:28:35,303
And it'd be nice.

2804
02:28:35,760 --> 02:28:38,220
This sense of,
isn't it,

2805
02:28:38,221 --> 02:28:43,221
about time that it is.
And I think there is a mainstream system

2806
02:28:43,680 --> 02:28:48,680
that's ready to incorporate that's
reaching out on the other side of yes.

2807
02:28:50,340 --> 02:28:55,340
And that this possibility of really
integrating this does seem to be the

2808
02:28:55,741 --> 02:28:57,960
case.
And I think with the military,

2809
02:28:58,310 --> 02:29:02,130
um,
I think that their training is to make

2810
02:29:02,131 --> 02:29:06,690
people who suppress their emotions and
to not feel the emotional consequences

2811
02:29:06,691 --> 02:29:09,420
to act in the heat of battle without the
emotions.

2812
02:29:09,780 --> 02:29:13,320
And I think with Mtma,
if you help people feel the emotional

2813
02:29:13,321 --> 02:29:17,550
consequences of their actions,
even if you've healed them from trauma

2814
02:29:17,551 --> 02:29:22,350
and they want to go back to their units,
that they are going to be more careful,

2815
02:29:22,351 --> 02:29:24,000
more sensitive,
they'll be.

2816
02:29:24,380 --> 02:29:24,870
I,
I,

2817
02:29:24,870 --> 02:29:27,150
so I,
I have,

2818
02:29:27,470 --> 02:29:28,170
uh,
uh,

2819
02:29:28,170 --> 02:29:32,940
there's a German psychiatrist that I'm
Torsten Passie and he's sort of raised

2820
02:29:32,941 --> 02:29:35,940
this issue for me is what about the
concentration camp guards?

2821
02:29:36,240 --> 02:29:40,140
What if they were tormented and they
came to you for Mtma therapy,

2822
02:29:41,150 --> 02:29:43,710
you know,
you're a German therapist and they come

2823
02:29:43,711 --> 02:29:45,540
to you.
Why would you treat the concentration

2824
02:29:45,541 --> 02:29:50,541
camp people for their trauma?
And I think the question is,

2825
02:29:51,300 --> 02:29:54,390
are they,
are people who are worked with in this

2826
02:29:54,391 --> 02:29:58,200
emotional way for their trauma,
more or less likely to go back into

2827
02:29:58,201 --> 02:30:00,190
these situations that produced the
trauma in?

2828
02:30:00,710 --> 02:30:02,640
Well,
the question only becomes valid if you

2829
02:30:02,641 --> 02:30:05,520
think,
should you punish a person who's done

2830
02:30:05,521 --> 02:30:09,120
something like that in always forever or
should you try to make them better?

2831
02:30:09,180 --> 02:30:10,130
Right?
I mean,

2832
02:30:10,150 --> 02:30:13,410
did you not exonerating them for what
the horrible things they've done,

2833
02:30:13,620 --> 02:30:15,510
but should,
if you're going to keep them alive,

2834
02:30:15,690 --> 02:30:17,820
shouldn't you try to make them a better
person?

2835
02:30:18,140 --> 02:30:20,130
Do you have some sort of responsibility
to do that?

2836
02:30:20,280 --> 02:30:24,180
I would say the argument,
if you want to look at our civilization

2837
02:30:24,270 --> 02:30:28,500
and the like the most efficient manner I
want to look at it and I'm like,

2838
02:30:28,501 --> 02:30:30,410
what is the best way to get our
civilization together?

2839
02:30:30,420 --> 02:30:32,370
We'll have less assholes,
less crazy people,

2840
02:30:32,371 --> 02:30:34,410
let's mean people less,
you know,

2841
02:30:34,411 --> 02:30:38,040
less psychopathic fucking security
guards at Auschwitz.

2842
02:30:38,160 --> 02:30:41,370
So if you do have one,
you could probably get a lot of data

2843
02:30:41,371 --> 02:30:44,940
from studying that guy and he's
obviously going to be in jail for the

2844
02:30:44,941 --> 02:30:47,190
rest of his life.
Was not going to hurt.

2845
02:30:47,220 --> 02:30:48,080
Yeah,
I mean what,

2846
02:30:48,130 --> 02:30:51,270
what I was trying to say is what you do
that for an active military where they,

2847
02:30:51,330 --> 02:30:54,030
it's not historical,
but they'd go back and I'm saying,

2848
02:30:54,031 --> 02:30:56,130
I know that's like,
would you do it for a hobbit?

2849
02:30:56,480 --> 02:30:58,110
You know,
what you get on your fucking time

2850
02:30:58,111 --> 02:31:00,630
machine and traveled back to the Roman
days given to them.

2851
02:31:00,780 --> 02:31:01,830
Well,
you don't have to worry about that.

2852
02:31:01,850 --> 02:31:03,810
Do you have to worry about people today?
Right.

2853
02:31:03,811 --> 02:31:05,790
And I feel that trying to bring that up

2854
02:31:05,810 --> 02:31:10,810
healing approach,
that those loving feelings which Mtma

2855
02:31:11,451 --> 02:31:13,880
can really generate through oxytocin and
prolactin.

2856
02:31:13,890 --> 02:31:17,690
The hormone is released that are in
nursing and bonding Mtma releases those

2857
02:31:17,691 --> 02:31:20,040
hormones,
that drugs that women get when they

2858
02:31:20,041 --> 02:31:20,910
orgasm.
Yeah,

2859
02:31:21,180 --> 02:31:21,960
yeah,
yeah.

2860
02:31:21,960 --> 02:31:26,850
And actually tourists has written this
terrific paper about how organisms the

2861
02:31:26,851 --> 02:31:31,470
post orgasmic state and he's compared
the poster orgasmic state and the

2862
02:31:31,471 --> 02:31:35,930
hormonal release to Mtma.
And I think when we talk about Mtma,

2863
02:31:35,931 --> 02:31:39,150
a good way to think about it is the post
orgasmic state.

2864
02:31:39,151 --> 02:31:40,290
You're satiated,
your,

2865
02:31:40,320 --> 02:31:41,760
you're not striving.
Dude.

2866
02:31:41,761 --> 02:31:44,220
If you could come and it felt as good as
beyond ecstasy.

2867
02:31:46,020 --> 02:31:48,990
Let's not kid ourselves.
Let's not kid ourselves.

2868
02:31:49,320 --> 02:31:53,030
I don't know what come coming for.
That guy feels like he's.

2869
02:31:53,200 --> 02:31:55,350
Feels like he's coming on Mtma.
Alright dude.

2870
02:31:55,530 --> 02:31:58,230
Settle down.
Settle down.

2871
02:31:58,830 --> 02:32:03,830
If I'm buying it
door summit of Mt.

2872
02:32:04,260 --> 02:32:08,270
I'm exaggerating a little,
but it just,

2873
02:32:08,950 --> 02:32:10,040
I mean it feels real good.

2874
02:32:10,640 --> 02:32:14,310
MTMA feels like you're not even here in
some the planet love,

2875
02:32:14,430 --> 02:32:16,050
you know,
I only did it once,

2876
02:32:16,410 --> 02:32:19,590
did it once to two pills.
Super powerful stuff.

2877
02:32:19,950 --> 02:32:23,520
The next day I was wrecked the.
That was not worth it for me.

2878
02:32:23,580 --> 02:32:25,680
I definitely learned a lot from the
experience,

2879
02:32:25,681 --> 02:32:27,690
but the next day was absolutely
horrendous.

2880
02:32:27,870 --> 02:32:29,970
Well,
it's probably horrendous because you

2881
02:32:29,971 --> 02:32:32,740
wanted to do things.
When we talk about people to.

2882
02:32:32,790 --> 02:32:36,230
We're thinking about Mtma,
what we say is don't do anything else.

2883
02:32:36,240 --> 02:32:39,510
It's a two day experience.
You need the second day to rest and

2884
02:32:39,511 --> 02:32:41,640
reflect and again,
what's the purpose of it?

2885
02:32:41,940 --> 02:32:43,810
If you're trying to have this
experiences,

2886
02:32:43,860 --> 02:32:48,660
loving experience and then kind of bring
appropriate some of that into your daily

2887
02:32:48,661 --> 02:32:52,410
life learning integrated.
Then the very next day is one of the

2888
02:32:52,411 --> 02:32:54,840
most important parts because you're
still halfway in,

2889
02:32:54,841 --> 02:32:56,910
halfway out,
you're able to think about it.

2890
02:32:56,911 --> 02:32:59,940
That's where a lot of the integration
work gets done.

2891
02:33:00,450 --> 02:33:04,290
So in our therapy we make it so that
people spend the night in the treatment

2892
02:33:04,291 --> 02:33:06,870
center just so that they don't have to
move,

2893
02:33:06,871 --> 02:33:10,950
they don't have to get distracted and
then there's hours of psychotherapy the

2894
02:33:10,950 --> 02:33:14,760
next day to help them integrate it and
then when they go home we call them

2895
02:33:14,761 --> 02:33:19,650
everyday on the of per week on the phone
just to check in and see how they're

2896
02:33:19,680 --> 02:33:21,810
doing.
So it's rick,

2897
02:33:22,290 --> 02:33:23,130
Rick,
Rick Doblin,

2898
02:33:23,140 --> 02:33:28,140
Woodside.
I feel like I just came all the time.

2899
02:33:29,580 --> 02:33:30,450
All the time,
Bro.

2900
02:33:32,040 --> 02:33:33,000
Alright man,
peace out.

2901
02:33:35,550 --> 02:33:37,990
We've got to wrap this up man.
Unfortunately we started a little late

2902
02:33:37,991 --> 02:33:39,440
and I gotta get Outta here.
Okay.

2903
02:33:39,450 --> 02:33:42,690
Um,
is there anything you can direct people

2904
02:33:42,691 --> 02:33:46,650
towards a website which is maps.org?
Yes.

2905
02:33:46,651 --> 02:33:51,651
And in fact we're having our 30th
anniversary celebration on Sunday,

2906
02:33:51,751 --> 02:33:54,210
April 17th and we're live streaming it
for free.

2907
02:33:54,640 --> 02:33:58,570
So it's maps.org/.
Um,

2908
02:33:58,650 --> 02:34:01,330
how are you going to know when people
are Dea agents undercover?

2909
02:34:01,350 --> 02:34:04,420
They're well tie clips actually.
Um,

2910
02:34:04,530 --> 02:34:09,530
we have our first reach senior retired
dea consultant and Martin man and smart.

2911
02:34:10,531 --> 02:34:11,910
But again,
it's compassion.

2912
02:34:11,940 --> 02:34:16,940
I mean he had a son who I'm listed in
the army and has ptsd and is 50 percent

2913
02:34:17,291 --> 02:34:18,580
disabled from ptsd

2914
02:34:18,640 --> 02:34:20,620
and is found marijuana to be helpful
again,

2915
02:34:20,680 --> 02:34:22,240
isn't it?
That's what.

2916
02:34:22,700 --> 02:34:23,470
Yeah,
that,

2917
02:34:23,470 --> 02:34:26,170
those,
those kinds of stories that helped me

2918
02:34:26,171 --> 02:34:30,700
think that we can do this integration.
We can and I am worried about right wing

2919
02:34:30,701 --> 02:34:33,520
backlash,
but there's a couple of things that

2920
02:34:33,521 --> 02:34:34,780
we've put into place.
First off,

2921
02:34:34,840 --> 02:34:36,160
to work with the military,
I mean,

2922
02:34:36,161 --> 02:34:39,220
right when gloves in the military,
if we're trying to help the military,

2923
02:34:39,221 --> 02:34:44,221
there's also people are compassionate
about a childhood sexual abuse survivors

2924
02:34:44,771 --> 02:34:49,771
and so
I think that we have enough of a base of

2925
02:34:51,640 --> 02:34:56,640
evidence and a long pattern since 1992
of the precedents at the FDA that I

2926
02:34:57,401 --> 02:35:02,401
think we could survive.
The FDA also recently did something very

2927
02:35:02,411 --> 02:35:07,411
interesting with the abortion pill.
Are you 46 that they made it easier on

2928
02:35:07,571 --> 02:35:09,630
women.
They eliminated one required step that

2929
02:35:09,640 --> 02:35:14,640
the science showed that they didn't need
and so the FDA is very much trying to be

2930
02:35:15,551 --> 02:35:18,270
science over politics.
I mean they,

2931
02:35:18,340 --> 02:35:21,460
they will have an FDA commissioner
that's appointed by and confirmed by

2932
02:35:21,461 --> 02:35:25,120
president,
but at the same time the people that are

2933
02:35:25,121 --> 02:35:28,570
there are really focused on science over
politics and compassion.

2934
02:35:28,571 --> 02:35:30,550
The other part is that we have
international strategy.

2935
02:35:30,720 --> 02:35:33,330
When was the last time anybody ever
talked over the music?

2936
02:35:33,480 --> 02:35:34,261
Oh,
it was awesome.

2937
02:35:34,261 --> 02:35:36,330
Awesome information.
I wish you didn't have it,

2938
02:35:36,470 --> 02:35:38,770
but I really do.
Thank you very much.

2939
02:35:38,980 --> 02:35:41,820
Hashtag psychedelic because tail.
It's like a dog because what does that

2940
02:35:41,821 --> 02:35:42,450
mean?
No,

2941
02:35:42,450 --> 02:35:43,590
don't say it.
Don't stop.

2942
02:35:43,800 --> 02:35:47,670
I got to go to maps.org.
And the uh,

2943
02:35:47,671 --> 02:35:51,570
the party one more time is April 17th.
April 17th.

2944
02:35:51,571 --> 02:35:52,830
In Oakland.
In Oakland.

2945
02:35:52,831 --> 02:35:54,480
Where?
At Scottish rite temple.

2946
02:35:54,481 --> 02:35:56,970
What time does it start?
It starts from five to 11.

2947
02:35:56,971 --> 02:35:58,440
And tickets at the door.
Um,

2948
02:35:58,740 --> 02:36:00,000
you know,
not for,

2949
02:36:00,030 --> 02:36:01,860
for the evening part,
but not for the banquet.

2950
02:36:01,861 --> 02:36:04,890
So you got to go to maps.org and you saw
that information.

2951
02:36:05,150 --> 02:36:06,120
Thank you.
Beautiful.

2952
02:36:06,121 --> 02:36:07,440
Thank you sir.
Much appreciated.

2953
02:36:07,740 --> 02:36:09,540
All Right Ladies and gentlemen.
That's it for the week.

2954

See you soon.

2955
02:36:10,681 --> 02:36:11,010
Bye.
