1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:05,330
Try by day Joe Rogan podcast by night
all day she and she's talking about,

2
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:07,410
this might be my last fight,

3
00:00:07,411 --> 00:00:07,561
blah,

4
00:00:07,561 --> 00:00:07,651
blah,

5
00:00:07,651 --> 00:00:08,250
blah.

6
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:09,660
So I don't think she said that.

7
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:11,550
I think she said she's close a few less.

8
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:15,420
Which when you hear that right that you
were talking about having one foot out

9
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:15,980
bowls.

10
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:17,760
So let's say she has two fights left,

11
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:19,231
maybe three,

12
00:00:19,231 --> 00:00:19,621
who knows,

13
00:00:19,621 --> 00:00:21,000
but she's not the same draw as Connor.

14
00:00:21,001 --> 00:00:21,630
It's just not,

15
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:22,400
it's just new.

16
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,011
You look at the number,

17
00:00:23,011 --> 00:00:24,000
she's not the same drawl,

18
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:29,690
but if she comes back beats and Amanda
Nunez armbars or and then fight Cyborg

19
00:00:29,761 --> 00:00:30,361
and then fights.

20
00:00:30,361 --> 00:00:34,380
Holly Beats Beats Holly gets her
rematch on Barnard as big as Connor.

21
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:37,410
You don't know that
because as that happened,

22
00:00:37,411 --> 00:00:38,780
he likes to bet Mr Joe Rody.

23
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:39,540
But here's the thing,

24
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:40,620
as these people,

25
00:00:40,621 --> 00:00:44,310
when they're star gets more
and more giant as Rhonda,

26
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:46,230
if Rhonda came back and
started winning again,

27
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:48,360
her star would get more and more giant.

28
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:49,021
It would get bigger.

29
00:00:49,021 --> 00:00:50,010
It would fuel more.

30
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:51,810
The more bodies she claims,

31
00:00:51,811 --> 00:00:53,520
the more fuel for her fire we'll have.

32
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:55,140
That is what happens all the time.

33
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:56,730
It means it's pure speculation.

34
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:59,100
But when the way Connor has been winning,

35
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,910
she can win in spectacular fashion or the
way she was winning when she fucked up

36
00:01:02,911 --> 00:01:05,510
Alexis Davis and Sara Mcmann Merkin girls,

37
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:07,650
mark and convention custom one 15.

38
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,570
She could never make,

39
00:01:09,571 --> 00:01:10,404
but you know what I'm saying?

40
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:11,880
Fuck No.

41
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:12,743
Why not?

42
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:13,210
She,

43
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:14,100
she's way too big,

44
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:15,330
but is she okay?

45
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:16,410
That'd be,

46
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:16,830
I mean,

47
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:16,981
yeah,

48
00:01:16,981 --> 00:01:17,820
because she looks really,

49
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:20,400
really rushed away and
sometimes that ain't,

50
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:21,240
that's,

51
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,073
this is nothing.

52
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:23,513
But um,

53
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:25,860
if for Conor and this,

54
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:26,461
and again,

55
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:27,490
I'm not rooting for favorites to,

56
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,580
I'm just saying it from
business standpoint for Connor,

57
00:01:29,581 --> 00:01:30,630
he's such a big draw.

58
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:31,320
Right?

59
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,410
What's going to help him
in his negotiating power if
Rhonda worked her lose this

60
00:01:34,411 --> 00:01:35,700
next fight because then he's like,

61
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:37,200
I'm the only motherfucker in town.

62
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:38,970
You guys were just claiming me and Rhonda.

63
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:39,690
That's cool.

64
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:40,530
She's just lost.

65
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,730
I need my fucking money.

66
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:42,030
Well,

67
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:42,661
and by the way,

68
00:01:42,661 --> 00:01:43,051
Ron has,

69
00:01:43,051 --> 00:01:44,850
has a tough fight in front of her.

70
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:45,740
Amanda Nunez has,

71
00:01:45,741 --> 00:01:46,740
God damn scary.

72
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:48,090
She's scary girl.

73
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:51,270
I was saying before Ronda lost to Holly,

74
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,460
I was saying she should've got
the title fight and I said,

75
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:53,910
I said that,

76
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:55,300
I think she's the most dangerous one.

77
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:56,323
I was talking shit to you.

78
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:57,900
The way she stopped Sam Mcmann.

79
00:01:57,901 --> 00:01:59,700
She cracks hanging I with that right hand.

80
00:01:59,701 --> 00:02:00,910
She hits like a Mack truck.

81
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,100
She hits like a dude,

82
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:02,970
but she,

83
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:03,390
well,

84
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:04,560
Cyborg kits like a dude,

85
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:05,850
Amanda hits like a strong girl.

86
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:06,893
Big Difference.

87
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,293
Uh,

88
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:10,040
case like scary.

89
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,550
Like Tyrone Woodley with braids.

90
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:14,161
Let's be real.

91
00:02:14,161 --> 00:02:18,420
She hits so hard and gets no love cause
you so goddamn scary and can't make the

92
00:02:18,421 --> 00:02:18,750
weight.

93
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,280
She also has a,

94
00:02:20,281 --> 00:02:21,420
a better arsenal.

95
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:22,830
Like she'll throw kicks and knees.

96
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:24,120
Also Blackstone on the ground.

97
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,353
Think Amanda.

98
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:26,220
Amanda is,

99
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:30,060
but Amanda has lost on the ground before
she got beat up by cats and gone on the

100
00:02:30,061 --> 00:02:30,540
ground.

101
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:31,330
Correct.

102
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:33,300
Cyber Grip your limbs off.

103
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:34,680
But she's getting no love.

104
00:02:34,681 --> 00:02:35,430
But um,

105
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:36,263
she's too big.

106
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:38,820
I know it's nine 55.

107
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:39,270
Well,

108
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:40,103
at one 50.

109
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,110
Well,

110
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:41,581
and again,

111
00:02:41,581 --> 00:02:41,761
if,

112
00:02:41,761 --> 00:02:44,610
like if they did that whole thing where
I'm talking about the eliminated weight

113
00:02:44,611 --> 00:02:44,831
cuts,

114
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:45,690
so there'd be two girls.

115
00:02:45,691 --> 00:02:49,080
A cyborg would fight it like one 81 80.

116
00:02:49,081 --> 00:02:49,620
It'd be,

117
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,420
it'd be hurt in that big ass girl.

118
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:52,590
Gabby can't see us.

119
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,760
He applies it to 80,

120
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:55,050
but that's all we got for,

121
00:02:55,051 --> 00:02:56,160
you would have to cut weight to me.

122
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:56,490
Yeah.

123
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:57,660
We fight every other weekend.

124
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:00,040
Like Tim Silvia and Andrea Lawsky.

125
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:02,050
Let's do that every other weekend,

126
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:08,240
every other weekend because
all we did is the old days.

127
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:09,093
But uh,

128
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:09,410
I,

129
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:10,860
I think for Rhonda,

130
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:13,000
the Amanda Nunez Fight
stylist getting again,

131
00:03:13,001 --> 00:03:13,541
we don't know.

132
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:16,580
We don't know where
Rhonda is a mental state.

133
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:16,981
Is that,

134
00:03:16,981 --> 00:03:19,330
but stylists gates a
great matchup for Rhonda?

135
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:19,931
I think so.

136
00:03:19,931 --> 00:03:20,141
Yeah.

137
00:03:20,141 --> 00:03:22,720
I think if she comes ready
prepared as a good camp,

138
00:03:22,721 --> 00:03:23,470
she Mercer,

139
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:26,590
but don't you think that you look
at the way she fucked up Misha Tate,

140
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:29,530
Eagle techgirl presents a lot
of danger with those punches,

141
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:31,810
especially considering what
happened with Holly and Ronda.

142
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:32,501
Yeah.

143
00:03:32,501 --> 00:03:33,250
But yeah,

144
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:34,240
I think she presents a lot of,

145
00:03:34,241 --> 00:03:35,950
Danes shoot a hundred percent Joe.

146
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:36,761
I think you Ryan that,

147
00:03:36,761 --> 00:03:41,761
but I think her marching forward is the
perfect antidote to get murked by Rhonda

148
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:42,611
cause she's like,

149
00:03:42,611 --> 00:03:43,810
oh come get some of this judo though.

150
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:46,450
I'm an arm bar your ass
if she marches forward,

151
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:48,400
which is really all she knows how to do.

152
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:49,803
You know what I'm saying?

153
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:50,891
It could be interesting.

154
00:03:50,891 --> 00:03:52,030
It's a great fight either way,

155
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:55,240
but it's also interesting to see what
we're round his head is now she's coming

156
00:03:55,241 --> 00:03:55,451
back.

157
00:03:55,451 --> 00:03:58,120
That's the x factor because if
it's wrong 100% she beats her.

158
00:03:58,121 --> 00:04:00,340
I think nine out of 10
times wrong words it,

159
00:04:00,341 --> 00:04:03,430
I know but if it's Rhonda who's
kind of our want to do movies,

160
00:04:03,431 --> 00:04:03,941
I don't do this,

161
00:04:03,941 --> 00:04:04,990
I this isn't for me.

162
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:05,943
You're going to get marked.

163
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,090
Cause that girl hit so hard.

164
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:10,030
Well what Rhonda has and
what you want to has,

165
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:11,373
you know,

166
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:15,520
and not a whole lot of other women
have it is one thing that they do where

167
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:18,430
they're really fucking good at it and
then they have all those other stuff.

168
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:19,090
Correct.

169
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:22,000
Whereas like Paige vanzant has kind
of learning the whole sport and she's

170
00:04:22,001 --> 00:04:22,850
learning as she goes.

171
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:23,240
I,

172
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:23,711
she goes,

173
00:04:23,711 --> 00:04:24,040
yeah,

174
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:24,430
but she,

175
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,110
what she does,

176
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:27,880
what Paige has is just
toughness and she's hot.

177
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:29,410
Then I'll just take your sleep.

178
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:29,861
That helps.

179
00:04:29,861 --> 00:04:30,700
Definitely helps.

180
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:33,220
But there's not other girls,

181
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:36,460
you know other than Valentina
Valentina Shift Chanko yeah.

182
00:04:36,461 --> 00:04:37,840
She's another one is bad ass.

183
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,330
Who is another super powerful striker.

184
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:40,660
Yeah.

185
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:42,820
I mean the way she handled
Holly Holm standing up.

186
00:04:42,821 --> 00:04:43,540
I know man.

187
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:43,890
Yeah.

188
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:44,560
Handled her.

189
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,550
Just countered or at will that,

190
00:04:46,551 --> 00:04:47,560
that looping left hook,

191
00:04:47,561 --> 00:04:49,450
that check hook that just
throws off the right side.

192
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:50,410
Yeah.

193
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:52,330
She's another one but there's not,

194
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,370
they need more of those,

195
00:04:54,371 --> 00:04:54,551
you know?

196
00:04:54,551 --> 00:04:55,300
I agree.

197
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,680
That's where Mackenzie dern fits.

198
00:04:56,681 --> 00:04:57,514
Exactly.

199
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,950
Come and do work and she's gorgeous.

200
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:02,260
But I'm saying if if college like,

201
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:02,980
listen,

202
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:04,300
I don't wish bad on anyone,

203
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:05,560
but Ronda were to lose.

204
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:06,930
We thrown a party in Ireland.

205
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,270
I'm the only show in town now.

206
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,770
Gimme my fucking piece of the pot.

207
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,440
Well nobody has that sort
of personality that he has.

208
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:15,370
No one ever.

209
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,940
I think even he eclipses Ali.

210
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,130
I've seen clips is all of them.

211
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:19,180
I think he's,

212
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:21,440
he's bigger than Chael
Sonnen for sure too.

213
00:05:21,441 --> 00:05:22,810
As far as like his ability to,

214
00:05:22,811 --> 00:05:23,350
uh,

215
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:24,010
Talk Shit.

216
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:24,910
Not Big on all of them,

217
00:05:24,911 --> 00:05:25,210
but yeah,

218
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:26,043
I think he is.

219
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:27,190
I think he's better than Ali.

220
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:29,500
Ali Ali stood for a different thing,

221
00:05:29,501 --> 00:05:29,880
right?

222
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,530
Like it's,

223
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:32,110
his message is more important.

224
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:33,580
Your fight for equal rights,

225
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:36,410
but he's also fighting to stop
the Vietnam War act like this.

226
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:39,760
There's times he had several
things could form that were bigger.

227
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:40,653
Correct.

228
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,100
Connor is white privilege.

229
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:43,460
Yeah.

230
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:44,293
His nice suits.

231
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,153
Nice suits.

232
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:48,370
If the government's not trying to
send them over to fight in a war zone,

233
00:05:48,371 --> 00:05:48,681
even a man,

234
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:50,680
they're not stripping
his belt for how long?

235
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:51,603
Three years old fight.

236
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,331
Three fucking years.

237
00:05:52,331 --> 00:05:53,350
And it's pretty prime.

238
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:53,791
It's prime.

239
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,560
It's like basically taking the
belt from Conrad on the right.

240
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:55,931
Three years.

241
00:05:55,931 --> 00:05:56,764
We'll see you soon.

242
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:06,440
Okay.
