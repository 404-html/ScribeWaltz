1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:01,660
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:02,201
I don't know.

3
00:00:02,201 --> 00:00:05,440
I think Obama is about to give a
speech today about this nonsense.

4
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:06,841
Yeah,

5
00:00:06,841 --> 00:00:06,970
the,

6
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:07,440
the,

7
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,580
even CNN,

8
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:12,420
the front of it is like Obama's
challenge convincing you on Syria.

9
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:15,690
It's 0% of the public
thinks we should do it.

10
00:00:15,691 --> 00:00:18,900
I haven't seen one person argue
that we should attack Syria.

11
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:22,590
Literally my mom even said she didn't
want to go to war and she was always

12
00:00:22,591 --> 00:00:23,850
backing up all the other words.

13
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:25,500
I think people are just learning.

14
00:00:25,501 --> 00:00:26,520
It's just we've been hoarse,

15
00:00:26,521 --> 00:00:28,290
fucked for so many years now.

16
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:32,370
We've been horse fuck since 2001 I
mean that's really hard to believe.

17
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:35,790
It's really hard to believe that it's
been 12 years of horse fucking the whole

18
00:00:35,791 --> 00:00:39,360
world's been horse fucked
and at this point time,

19
00:00:39,361 --> 00:00:44,361
especially with this second term of this
supposedly liberal and ordering drone

20
00:00:45,481 --> 00:00:48,990
strikes like crazy threatening
military action for this one.

21
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:50,290
Ambiguous.

22
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:50,731
I mean,

23
00:00:50,731 --> 00:00:52,530
I don't know who the
fuck cause that strike,

24
00:00:52,531 --> 00:00:56,340
but I know Ron Paul says that
it was a false flag is Ron Paul,

25
00:00:56,341 --> 00:00:57,060
right?

26
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:58,200
What the fuck do I know?

27
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,520
But if somebody wanted us to go to Syria
for some other reason and they decided

28
00:01:02,521 --> 00:01:03,960
to orchestrate and attack,

29
00:01:03,961 --> 00:01:07,140
that would force the United States
hand and to going into Syria.

30
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:07,921
Shit,

31
00:01:07,921 --> 00:01:08,131
dude,

32
00:01:08,131 --> 00:01:09,090
that's possible.

33
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:10,800
If you don't pay attention to history,

34
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:12,210
you might think it's not possible.

35
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:13,890
But if you do pay attention to history,

36
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:14,400
it's,

37
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,233
it's happened.

38
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:17,300
It happened with the Gulf
of Tonkin [inaudible] it,

39
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:18,720
and that was even Shaker.

40
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:19,800
There was even faker than this.

41
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:19,991
Well,

42
00:01:19,991 --> 00:01:21,520
look from the Pov of,

43
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:22,240
uh,

44
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:22,601
some,

45
00:01:22,601 --> 00:01:27,601
some are revolutionary
fundamentalist Islamic,

46
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:28,503
uh,

47
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:30,790
person who's planning these attacks.

48
00:01:30,791 --> 00:01:31,450
We know that,

49
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:32,140
uh,

50
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:33,220
a lot of people,

51
00:01:33,221 --> 00:01:33,820
uh,

52
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:36,100
people who are fundamentalist Islamic,

53
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:37,750
wha what we call terrorists,

54
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:41,560
they don't have a problem putting dynamite
in their body and blowing themselves

55
00:01:41,561 --> 00:01:41,771
up.

56
00:01:41,771 --> 00:01:46,720
So it's not beyond the Pale to
think that in the scheme of things,

57
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,260
once they realize if
they do a serin attack,

58
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:55,500
it could possibly cause the United States
to attack and unleash hell on Assad.

59
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:56,111
Well,

60
00:01:56,111 --> 00:01:56,471
yeah,

61
00:01:56,471 --> 00:01:58,090
that's a logical decision to make.

62
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,620
And why would a sod knowing that
if he did a chemical attack,

63
00:02:02,621 --> 00:02:03,670
it could cause the,

64
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:08,780
all the gains he's made in his shitty
Goddamn a civil war to go away.

65
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:10,070
Why would he do that?

66
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:12,170
Doesn't make any sense and easy.

67
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:12,700
I don't,

68
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:13,290
he seems,

69
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:16,120
I think he's a vicious piece
of shit from what I've read,

70
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,710
but he doesn't seem stupid.

71
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:22,420
And apparently he was already kind of
winning that war as are making great

72
00:02:22,421 --> 00:02:23,260
advances,

73
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:23,921
you know,

74
00:02:23,921 --> 00:02:25,180
so I don't know why suddenly he's like,

75
00:02:25,181 --> 00:02:25,351
yeah,

76
00:02:25,351 --> 00:02:26,410
I released the gas,

77
00:02:26,411 --> 00:02:30,210
the gas that will make it so that we
get in a super power to stop bump,

78
00:02:30,211 --> 00:02:30,940
start bombing us.

79
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:32,560
And who was he fighting against?

80
00:02:32,561 --> 00:02:34,600
Isn't he fighting against the Taliban?

81
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:35,441
Uh,

82
00:02:35,441 --> 00:02:37,240
well it's a may fight against al Qaeda.

83
00:02:37,241 --> 00:02:38,260
It's not just al Qaeda.

84
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:39,041
It's a mixture.

85
00:02:39,041 --> 00:02:39,671
From what I saw,

86
00:02:39,671 --> 00:02:40,240
there was this,

87
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:40,601
uh,

88
00:02:40,601 --> 00:02:41,321
I can't remember,

89
00:02:41,321 --> 00:02:41,710
it was on,

90
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:44,890
it wasn't on scene and it was on
one of these weird news channels.

91
00:02:44,891 --> 00:02:49,630
It was just a conference with a Po
analysts talking about what Syria,

92
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:52,870
what the revolution or the
civil wars comprised of.

93
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:54,430
And it's not all al Qaeda.

94
00:02:54,431 --> 00:02:56,530
And it's not all Taliban and it's not all,

95
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,700
it's different.

96
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:58,990
It's different groups.

97
00:02:59,020 --> 00:02:59,801
Just in the same way,

98
00:02:59,801 --> 00:03:02,320
if there was a revolution
in the United States,

99
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,030
it wouldn't just be one group.

100
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:05,470
It wouldn't just be the tea party,

101
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:05,860
right.

102
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:07,390
It would be an arc is,

103
00:03:07,391 --> 00:03:08,224
it would be,

104
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:09,213
uh,

105
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,440
you occupy wall streeters.

106
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:12,820
It would be environmental is,

107
00:03:12,821 --> 00:03:14,650
it would be fundamentalist Christians.

108
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:17,170
That's what a civil war really is,

109
00:03:17,171 --> 00:03:22,171
is just this shattering of people into
groups with one initial main goal,

110
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:25,410
which is get Assad out of
power and then the next,

111
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:29,830
that's where revolution can really suck
or a civil work and really suck because

112
00:03:29,831 --> 00:03:32,650
then the thing collapses on itself and
they all start attacking each other.

113
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:37,240
Did you see that John Kerry used
a fake photo to fuels Syrian war?

114
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:38,980
I heard him as the photo of the bodies.

115
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:40,900
This is the photo.

116
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:46,300
It's a photo from 2003 from the Iraq
war of a little boy jumping over these

117
00:03:46,331 --> 00:03:49,420
lines of bodies and he
used that in a speech.

118
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:50,920
I'll try to beat the war drums.

119
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:53,950
How the fuck could he know
or how could he not know,

120
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:55,930
rather that that's a bad photo to use.

121
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:56,111
Yeah,

122
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:56,651
no shit,

123
00:03:56,651 --> 00:03:57,010
man.

124
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:57,611
Of course he knew,

125
00:03:57,611 --> 00:03:57,970
right?

126
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:00,220
How about McCain playing
fucking video poker?

127
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,570
Yeah.

128
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:02,830
When they were talking about box,

129
00:04:02,831 --> 00:04:04,030
these are fucking sucks,

130
00:04:04,031 --> 00:04:04,780
man.

131
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:05,110
They're,

132
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:08,920
they're talking about evaporating human
beings and the guys so comfortable.

133
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:10,720
These fucking playing video poker.

134
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,280
The only thing that he
thinks we should go,

135
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:13,510
doesn't he?

136
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:13,871
He was,

137
00:04:13,871 --> 00:04:14,051
yeah.

138
00:04:14,051 --> 00:04:15,460
He loves war McCain's a big,

139
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,020
he's a big fan of war.

140
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:18,100
He think he's supporting it,

141
00:04:18,101 --> 00:04:18,370
right?

142
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:19,930
He supported like seven wards.

143
00:04:19,931 --> 00:04:20,380
Yeah.

144
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:21,131
Oh hell yeah.

145
00:04:21,131 --> 00:04:21,970
Here he comes.

146
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:24,970
This is the live.

147
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:25,580
Yeah.

148
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:25,871
Look at him.

149
00:04:25,871 --> 00:04:28,330
He has to walk down a red
carpet and how dramatic

150
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:29,880
my fellow Americans.

151
00:04:29,881 --> 00:04:30,900
Hello President.

152
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:31,030
No,

153
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:32,730
I don't want to talk to you about Syria.

154
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:33,630
Oh boy.

155
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:36,090
Why it matters and where we go from here.

156
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,940
Over the past two years,

157
00:04:38,941 --> 00:04:43,110
what began as a series of peaceful
protests against the repressive regime of

158
00:04:43,111 --> 00:04:46,410
Bashar al Assad has turned
into a brutal civil war.

159
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,590
Over a hundred thousand
people had been killed.

160
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:53,760
Millions have fled the
country in that time.

161
00:04:53,761 --> 00:04:57,990
America's worked with allies to provide
humanitarian support to help the

162
00:04:57,991 --> 00:05:01,230
moderate opposition and to
shape a political settlement,

163
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:07,370
but I have resisted calls for military
action because we cannot resolve someone

164
00:05:07,531 --> 00:05:09,600
else's civil war through force,

165
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:13,620
particularly after a decade of
war in Iraq and Afghanistan.

166
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:20,450
The situation profoundly changed though
on August 21st when Assad's government

167
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:23,490
gassed to death over a thousand people,

168
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:25,680
including hundreds of children.

169
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,700
The images from this
massacre are sickening.

170
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:31,531
Men,

171
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:32,310
women,

172
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:32,881
children,

173
00:05:32,881 --> 00:05:35,280
lying and rose killed my poison gas.

174
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:37,770
Others foaming at the mouth,

175
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,060
gasping for breath,

176
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:41,940
father clutching his bed,

177
00:05:41,941 --> 00:05:42,910
show him on man,

178
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,780
imploring them to get up and walk.

179
00:05:44,781 --> 00:05:46,500
It's better to set them on fire

180
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:50,310
and gruesome detail.

181
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:52,360
The of my nature of chemical weapons.

182
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:53,543
How crazy.

183
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,473
The same,

184
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:59,000
giving these images a father clutching
children like what do you do?

185
00:05:59,001 --> 00:05:59,331
Are you,

186
00:05:59,331 --> 00:06:00,680
what are you an actor?

187
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:05,420
Like what's with the dramatic narrative
of father clutching his children?

188
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:08,150
Babies could be your baby.

189
00:06:08,151 --> 00:06:12,410
American Gis work on the many thousands
killed by deadly gas and the trenches of

190
00:06:12,411 --> 00:06:13,244
Europe

191
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:15,103
in World War II.

192
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:18,650
The Nazis used gassed and flicked
the horror of the Holocaust.

193
00:06:18,651 --> 00:06:20,750
We must use fire or not gas fire.

194
00:06:20,751 --> 00:06:22,910
These weapons can kill on a mass scale.

195
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:26,150
What the distinction between
soldier and mass chill?

196
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:30,170
No distinction between soldier and fn
central like drones don't mean like

197
00:06:30,171 --> 00:06:30,621
drones.

198
00:06:30,621 --> 00:06:34,930
What about Hiroshima Teen 97
what about the 98% civilian rate?

199
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:38,720
Your drones have killed international
agreement prohibiting the use of chemical

200
00:06:38,721 --> 00:06:39,170
weapons.

201
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:40,460
We sat him on five joints,

202
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,880
marinade on governments

203
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:47,150
national agreement that we shouldn't use
drones because I would think that that

204
00:06:47,151 --> 00:06:48,490
would be a bad thing to use to.

205
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:50,660
These basic rules were violated.

206
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:51,380
Oh Man.

207
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:53,990
Pong with our sense of
common humanity of murder.

208
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,220
No one disputes that chemical
weapons were used in Syria.

209
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:01,370
The world saw thousands of videos,

210
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,840
cell phone pictures,

211
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:07,430
and social media accounts from the attack
and humanitarian organizations told

212
00:07:07,431 --> 00:07:11,510
stories of hospitals packed with
people who had symptoms of poison gas.

213
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:14,300
Moreover,

214
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:19,300
we know the Assad regime was responsible
in the days leading up to August 21st

215
00:07:20,271 --> 00:07:24,830
we know that Assad's chemical weapons
personnel prepared for an attack near an

216
00:07:24,831 --> 00:07:26,960
area where they mix serin gas.

217
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:30,080
Could you imagine they distributed
gas mess to their trial?

218
00:07:30,081 --> 00:07:30,711
Paranoid.

219
00:07:30,711 --> 00:07:33,800
This dude gets it and they fired
rockets from a regime controlled areas.

220
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:35,880
He's killed tap dance on it.

221
00:07:35,881 --> 00:07:37,200
She had all the kids,

222
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:38,190
not,

223
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:39,470
that's just one part of it.

224
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:43,490
But just imagine all the
conflict that he's engaged in.

225
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:45,170
Mortal death,

226
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:47,810
con wounded all over the globe.

227
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:48,031
You know,

228
00:07:48,031 --> 00:07:48,970
seeing your figures.

229
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,090
It's really gross,

230
00:07:50,091 --> 00:07:50,361
man.

231
00:07:50,361 --> 00:07:55,100
If you have to like work on your speech
to tell people to go to war and kill it,

232
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:57,350
you don't want to hear what he says.

233
00:07:57,351 --> 00:07:58,040
I don't hear it that shit.

234
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:58,790
But he said,

235
00:07:58,790 --> 00:07:59,541
do you want to keep going?

236
00:07:59,541 --> 00:07:59,721
Okay,

237
00:07:59,721 --> 00:08:00,590
I just want to know if,

238
00:08:00,591 --> 00:08:02,000
what if we're going to start bombing?

239
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,420
He's going,

240
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:03,340
we're start bombing.

241
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:04,490
He's gonna start doing something.

242
00:08:04,491 --> 00:08:05,360
I think he might say,

243
00:08:05,361 --> 00:08:06,170
we're going to cut.

244
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:06,681
I don't know.

245
00:08:06,681 --> 00:08:07,340
Maybe you're right.

246
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:08,210
Listen to what he's saying.

247
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:09,560
There's commit atrocities.

248
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:14,690
They depend upon the world to look the
other way and until those horrifying

249
00:08:14,691 --> 00:08:15,920
pictures fade from memory,

250
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:16,611
what about us,

251
00:08:16,611 --> 00:08:17,420
man,

252
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:18,510
but these things happen.

253
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:19,511
We burn,

254
00:08:19,511 --> 00:08:19,791
we did.

255
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:21,230
The facts cannot be denied.

256
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:26,900
The question now is what the United
States of America and the international

257
00:08:26,901 --> 00:08:29,090
community is prepared to do about it?

258
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:29,531
Oh,

259
00:08:29,531 --> 00:08:30,950
you mean France and Saudi Arabia's?

260
00:08:30,951 --> 00:08:32,030
What happened to those people?

261
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:33,973
For those children?

262
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,740
There's not only a violation
of international law,

263
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:39,800
it's also a danger to our security.

264
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:39,920
Well,

265
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,510
let's call it the bombs
he's going to drop,

266
00:08:41,511 --> 00:08:42,181
aren't going to kill them.

267
00:08:42,181 --> 00:08:43,880
Explain why they don't kill any kids.

268
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:49,650
Two magnets going together to stop using
tells innocence baby bonds as the ban

269
00:08:51,051 --> 00:08:52,640
against these weapons roads.

270
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:58,020
Other tyrants will have no reason to
think about acquiring poison gas and using

271
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:58,230
them.

272
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:03,230
Cheese over time were troops would
again face the prospect theory.

273
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,160
I'm going to get some poison gas.

274
00:09:05,161 --> 00:09:08,860
It could be easier if the
terrorist organizations to
obtain this one gets a free

275
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:14,010
fucking liberal policy fighting
spills beyond sooner as well.

276
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:15,560
I knew poison gas pistol,

277
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:17,580
that is how someone who was a tea party,

278
00:09:17,581 --> 00:09:20,340
Manchurian candidate would
react if they have blood.

279
00:09:20,341 --> 00:09:20,710
You know,

280
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:22,500
Bama wants to be such a fucking pussy.

281
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:23,400
I had tissues,

282
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:26,910
country lesson on my own because none
of those terrorists have the balls to

283
00:09:26,911 --> 00:09:29,010
fucking go after Americans
to keep America strong.

284
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,960
I went after America,

285
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,340
keep America strong,

286
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:33,951
dude.

287
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:35,110
I can't listen to it,

288
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:35,953
man.

289
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,610
I'm sure that Shit's going to take a long
ass time and then it's going to freak

290
00:09:40,611 --> 00:09:43,400
everybody out and it's going to be
the subject of discussion tomorrow.

291
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:44,000
Um,

292
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I think it's very unfortunate that we
live in this world and to listen to that,

293
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:49,670
to,

294
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:54,670
to think that he could be so free in
talking about this sort of moralization,

295
00:09:56,571 --> 00:10:01,370
is that a word of warfare when
we've killed so many fucking people,

296
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,560
it's just really hard to believe.

297
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:06,410
And those numbers that
we read off about deaths,

298
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:07,940
those are just drones.

299
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:09,590
That's just drone deaths.

300
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:11,870
The 98% is just drone desks.

301
00:10:11,871 --> 00:10:15,050
It doesn't even factor in how many
innocent people were killed in the wars in

302
00:10:15,051 --> 00:10:16,460
Afghanistan and Iraq.

303
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:16,911
But yeah,

304
00:10:16,911 --> 00:10:17,651
and again,

305
00:10:17,651 --> 00:10:17,840
yeah,

306
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:20,990
it is the hypocrisy that it's
okay to kill people with fire.

307
00:10:20,991 --> 00:10:22,670
It's not okay to kill with gas.

308
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:27,710
And this being s coming out of the mouth
of a man who regularly kills people

309
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:28,370
with fire.

310
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:30,410
Have you seen the video of the guys,

311
00:10:30,411 --> 00:10:32,150
the rebels in the street
and get hit by a missile?

312
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:33,620
Now pull that shit up,

313
00:10:33,621 --> 00:10:34,120
Brian.

314
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:34,390
The,

315
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:34,640
the,

316
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,600
they start screaming.

317
00:10:35,601 --> 00:10:36,160
A lot of walk,

318
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:36,481
blah,

319
00:10:36,481 --> 00:10:36,780
blah.

320
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:39,260
Walk Fire Gas,

321
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:40,880
which is search for madness.

322
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:41,540
Um,

323
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:42,950
how about Syrian rebels?

324
00:10:42,951 --> 00:10:43,731
Hit with a bomb.

325
00:10:43,731 --> 00:10:44,240
Maybe.

326
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,890
Let's say Syrian rebels.

327
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:47,620
Yup.

328
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:48,830
With bomb.

329
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:50,050
Okay.

330
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:50,860
Let me find out.

331
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:52,720
It's fucking madness.

332
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:53,583
It's a video.

333
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,340
Let's see.

334
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:56,051
Yeah.

335
00:10:56,051 --> 00:10:57,220
Syrian rebels.

336
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:00,380
MMM HM.

337
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,360
People are all listening
to this speech right now,

338
00:11:02,361 --> 00:11:02,571
man.

339
00:11:02,571 --> 00:11:04,010
We should just be with Syrian rebels.

340
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,600
Almost hit by a bomb.

341
00:11:05,601 --> 00:11:06,440
Let them listen,

342
00:11:06,441 --> 00:11:06,741
man.

343
00:11:06,741 --> 00:11:06,920
This,

344
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:07,310
uh,

345
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:08,810
this is being recorded.

346
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:09,980
It will be gone forever.

347
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:10,280
No,

348
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,113
that's not it.

349
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:13,820
There's one is one recent,

350
00:11:13,821 --> 00:11:16,850
one of these guys in this
street and this bomb.

351
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:17,600
That's not it.

352
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,430
Our troops are coming
home from Afghanistan,

353
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:21,020
Afghanistan here.

354
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:23,030
The Americans want all
of us in Washington,

355
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:28,130
especially me to concentrate on the task
of building our nation here at home.

356
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,500
But I have to kill people back to work,

357
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:32,060
educating our kids.

358
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:33,111
Oh,

359
00:11:33,111 --> 00:11:33,910
our kids,

360
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:34,221
owl,

361
00:11:34,221 --> 00:11:35,540
God man's blood.

362
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:39,340
Molnlycke Molnlycke demand sacrifice.

363
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:40,580
Don't feed the owl God.

364
00:11:40,581 --> 00:11:44,420
He comes to me and my dreams and if
I don't participate in the sacrifice,

365
00:11:44,421 --> 00:11:45,440
I won't get the mansion.

366
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:48,920
They have reserved a mansion
for me on a hundred acres.

367
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,410
I will constantly have.

368
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:52,131
Okay.

369
00:11:52,131 --> 00:11:52,371
Yeah.

370
00:11:52,371 --> 00:11:54,310
This is the one thrown of diamonds.

371
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:55,810
The one of diamonds.

372
00:11:55,811 --> 00:11:57,280
Wait for me at the end
of the black tunnel.

373
00:11:57,281 --> 00:11:58,630
I must feed the our God.

374
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:03,423
Yeah.

375
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,590
What the fuck man?

376
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:06,203
Really?

377
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,433
Is that what we've come?

378
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:08,270
Yeah.

379
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:09,051
That is it,

380
00:12:09,051 --> 00:12:09,884
man.

381
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:12,390
Now what now?

382
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:13,390
Hmm.

383
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:13,881
The beach.

384
00:12:13,881 --> 00:12:15,820
The Lord desires blood.

385
00:12:15,821 --> 00:12:18,490
If you've is so beautiful as words,

386
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,990
how do you spell [inaudible]?

387
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:22,700
Uh,

388
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:23,540
let me look at my tattoo.

389
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:29,950
It was worth 90% of your butthole joke.

390
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:31,640
Rabo you just,

391
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,230
you just,

392
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:35,660
you just gave me great ground.

393
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:38,480
I can't find this fucking thing.

394
00:12:38,481 --> 00:12:39,380
These guys yell,

395
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:44,080
members of Congress have said there's no
point in simply doing a pinprick strike

396
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:45,023
pinprick.

397
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:45,993
Oh nope.

398
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:50,650
I never end up in one of its main breaks
strikes the United States military

399
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,120
doesn't do pinpricks.

400
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:54,820
We're just going to go down there
and pinch be even a limited stroke.

401
00:12:56,100 --> 00:13:01,090
No other nation can deliver
and no other I talked about.

402
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,450
We shouldn't move another dictator with
force and we learned from a rock the

403
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:04,721
doing.

404
00:13:04,721 --> 00:13:07,420
So it makes us responsible
for all that comes next.

405
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:13,320
But a targeted strike can make Assad or
any other dictator think twice before

406
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:14,860
using chemical weapons.

407
00:13:14,861 --> 00:13:17,110
Dictators are thinking about
using chemical weapons right now.

408
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:20,410
Other questions involve the
dangerous or retaliation.

409
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,260
We don't dismiss any threats,

410
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:27,070
but the Assad regime does not have the
ability to seriously threatened our

411
00:13:27,071 --> 00:13:29,080
military and the other.

412
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:33,650
Any other retaliation they might seek
is wine with threats that we face every

413
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:34,483
day.

414
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,380
So we're basically saying they're wheeler
Assad nor his allies have any interest

415
00:13:38,381 --> 00:13:42,280
in escalation that would lead
to his demise and our ally.

416
00:13:42,281 --> 00:13:45,400
Israel can defend itself
with overwhelming force.

417
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:48,280
We just want to kill this guy shakable
I'm conscious guy in the face of the

418
00:13:48,281 --> 00:13:49,540
United States of America.

419
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:50,861
Yeah.

420
00:13:50,861 --> 00:13:51,430
What is,

421
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:54,110
what the fuck is that many
of you have asked about?

422
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:55,990
Well,

423
00:13:55,990 --> 00:14:00,820
should we get involved at all in a place
that's so complicated and where there's

424
00:14:00,821 --> 00:14:01,870
one person wrote to me,

425
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:05,770
those who come after Assad may
be enemies of human rights.

426
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,200
You can write to Obama.

427
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:11,080
It's true that some of
us odds are extremists.

428
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:12,011
He'll listen,

429
00:14:12,011 --> 00:14:12,521
he'll change it.

430
00:14:12,521 --> 00:14:13,240
I'll cut up,

431
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:16,480
will only draw strength
in a more chaotic Syria.

432
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:21,430
If people there see the world doing
nothing to prevent innocent civilians from

433
00:14:21,431 --> 00:14:22,420
being gassed to death,

434
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:23,411
we burned them.

435
00:14:23,411 --> 00:14:27,220
We don't guess the majority of the Syrian
people and the Syrian opposition we

436
00:14:27,221 --> 00:14:29,500
work with just want to live in peace

437
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:35,020
and freedom and the day
after any military action,

438
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:40,030
we would redouble our efforts to achieve
a political solution that strengthens

439
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:43,360
those who reject the forces
of tyranny and extremism.

440
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:44,930
Joe Biden beat me a poker.

441
00:14:44,931 --> 00:14:46,220
He used to run Raytheon.

442
00:14:46,221 --> 00:14:47,670
They sell how it Hellfire missiles,

443
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:50,420
but I mean,

444
00:14:50,421 --> 00:14:51,680
listen to what he said.

445
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:54,470
What we're trying to stomp out
is exactly what we're doing.

446
00:14:54,471 --> 00:14:54,771
I mean the,

447
00:14:54,771 --> 00:14:54,911
the,

448
00:14:54,911 --> 00:14:56,990
the massive amount of hypocrisy.

449
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:58,640
We should not be the world's policemen.

450
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,250
We should be the world's dragon.

451
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:05,540
And I have a deeply held
preference for peaceful solutions.

452
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:06,590
Pull up this video.

453
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:07,880
Syrian soldiers,

454
00:15:07,881 --> 00:15:08,714
my administration,

455
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,010
Syrian rebels

456
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:14,440
by street crossing.

457
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:17,283
Well,

458
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:20,521
oh wait a minute.

459
00:15:20,521 --> 00:15:21,354
That's not the one

460
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:24,030
I'm trying to find the right one.

461
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:24,391
Oh,

462
00:15:24,391 --> 00:15:25,224
here it is.

463
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:25,750
Oh Damn.

464
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:26,670
It doesn't have a,

465
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,220
it has a crazy Arab name to it.

466
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:32,910
This wasn't him poke.

467
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:35,390
The Russian ghost is the
video willingness to join.

468
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:40,400
If you could find it in pushing aside
to give up his chemical water video.

469
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,860
The Assad regime has now admitted geyser,

470
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:44,290
uh,

471
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:48,280
weapons shooting in the street
and they get jack by a muscle.

472
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:50,790
This is what they're dealing with.

473
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,370
You got these guys who
have guns and like Duh,

474
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,990
Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh.

475
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,370
They pull up in a pickup truck.

476
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:56,820
Wow.

477
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:59,580
And then like we have an even
bigger gun in the pickup truck.

478
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:04,790
They're going to kick some ass and uh hmm.

479
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,540
Watch all the shit hits the fan here,

480
00:16:06,541 --> 00:16:07,080
man.

481
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:07,913
Siding,

482
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:09,601
siding day.

483
00:16:09,601 --> 00:16:10,650
Everyone's about to half.

484
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:12,631
These are,

485
00:16:12,631 --> 00:16:13,380
uh,

486
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:14,550
who's side are we on here?

487
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,160
I guess we're on the side of the
guys who are about to get jacked.

488
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:19,890
I who knows?

489
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:24,571
So they back.

490
00:16:24,571 --> 00:16:25,950
The guy backs up his truck.

491
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:28,003
Okay.

492
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:29,980
And they don't even have
a chance to respond.

493
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:30,490
What?

494
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:31,323
Wash,

495
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,150
look at this.

496
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:37,150
They're trying to move Christ
uhmm and the guy's just screaming.

497
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:38,530
Allah Akbar.

498
00:16:38,531 --> 00:16:39,370
Allahu Akbar.

499
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:40,691
Watch that again.

500
00:16:40,691 --> 00:16:41,524
Back that up again.

501
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:42,660
Uh,

502
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:43,600
you're actually controlling it.

503
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:44,770
Oh,

504
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:45,603
sorry.

505
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:47,290
Can I do that?

506
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,670
I don't want to go to
another fucking war man.

507
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:52,540
One more time.

508
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:53,950
We did a good job of
filling the screen there,

509
00:16:53,951 --> 00:16:54,280
buddy.

510
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:54,521
Yeah,

511
00:16:54,521 --> 00:16:55,510
that's actually really good.

512
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:56,111
All right.

513
00:16:56,111 --> 00:16:57,160
Watch this one more time.

514
00:16:57,610 --> 00:16:57,821
Look,

515
00:16:57,821 --> 00:16:59,650
they sort of realize it's happening.

516
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:00,671
Like look at them,

517
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:01,870
their body language like,

518
00:17:01,871 --> 00:17:02,441
like they're like,

519
00:17:02,441 --> 00:17:02,890
oh shit.

520
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:03,723
Oh Shit.

521
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:04,330
Okay.

522
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:05,590
Watch that stair you out the running.

523
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,633
Boom.

524
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:08,700
Are you fucking kidding me?

525
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:10,540
That's an ethical way to blow people up.

526
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,700
It's way better than chemical.

527
00:17:11,701 --> 00:17:12,820
It's a beautiful thing.

528
00:17:12,850 --> 00:17:13,810
Those guys are lucky.

529
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:16,210
That was like being killed
by an American Eagle.

530
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,040
That's like getting
killed by gourmet chef.

531
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:18,983
Couple sprints.

532
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:20,230
So precision.

533
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:25,690
The United States doesn't do
American pimp for seven decades.

534
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,430
I have a seven.

535
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:29,651
Let's here.

536
00:17:29,651 --> 00:17:30,670
He's about to wrap it up.

537
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:34,000
Doing more than 40 zero
international agreements.

538
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,340
It has meant enforcing them.

539
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:40,350
The burdens of leadership are often heavy.

540
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:44,010
I can't get it up unless I'm
Caroline because we have born them.

541
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,530
And so to my friends on the right,

542
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:48,940
I ask you to reconcile your,

543
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,040
to America's

544
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:55,040
military might with a failure to
act when a cause is so plainly just,

545
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:55,441
okay,

546
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:56,040
let's stop.

547
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,810
So he's probably though is he's the CEO.

548
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,970
Is he the worst president we've ever had?

549
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:05,070
He's the most disappointing
for sure because Bush was
scary from the jump and he

550
00:18:05,071 --> 00:18:06,540
was scary when he was going to war.

551
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:08,550
And it was scary when he
was misspelling words.

552
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:09,900
He was always scary.

553
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:12,300
But Obama was promising and now he's,

554
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,193
he's terrible.

555
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:14,700
That was awful.

556
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:15,751
That was awful.

557
00:18:15,751 --> 00:18:17,160
And it was so corny.

558
00:18:17,161 --> 00:18:18,120
It was so,

559
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,280
it was like watching that show.

560
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:23,820
What was that old a show
that used to be on Jag?

561
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:28,710
Remember Jag was a military
show on like NBC or CBS,

562
00:18:28,711 --> 00:18:29,400
CBS,

563
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,233
CBS.

564
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,081
It was like,

565
00:18:31,081 --> 00:18:31,740
you know,

566
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:33,810
it was fucking real clear.

567
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:34,890
The good guys.

568
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:35,813
Bad guys.

569
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,511
Good guys.

570
00:18:36,511 --> 00:18:37,344
Always one.

571
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:38,483
Everything was,

572
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:39,870
it was an episode of Walker,

573
00:18:39,871 --> 00:18:40,704
Texas Ranger.

574
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:41,850
That's what that was,

575
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:43,320
but he would just gave us,

576
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:47,370
I love what I really love is they try
to give the illusion that there's such

577
00:18:47,371 --> 00:18:48,450
thing as a safe war.

578
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:49,570
That's what's really funny.

579
00:18:49,571 --> 00:18:49,771
He's like,

580
00:18:49,771 --> 00:18:52,860
I'm just going to stick this
stick and the Hornet's nest.

581
00:18:52,861 --> 00:18:54,540
The Hornets can't fly over here.

582
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:55,680
You're going to be fine.

583
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:57,270
There'll be no retaliation.

584
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:00,960
They can't even retaliate and it's no
need to worry and it's the same kind of

585
00:19:00,961 --> 00:19:01,794
retaliation.

586
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:03,203
That's true,

587
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:04,740
but how crazy is that?

588
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:05,141
How the,

589
00:19:05,141 --> 00:19:07,800
the idea that you could just retaliate
and you could do that and not,

590
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:09,710
not face retaliation feet.

591
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:13,570
What if we attack Syria and
Russia decides to put missiles,

592
00:19:13,571 --> 00:19:14,404
shields up.

593
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,970
Now what does out now we have Obama
leading us in a fucking world war three

594
00:19:17,971 --> 00:19:19,710
against that crocodile Putin.

595
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:21,000
That's scary.

596
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:22,830
That's scary to think about,

597
00:19:22,831 --> 00:19:23,190
man.

598
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:24,030
I don't know man.

599
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:24,481
I just,

600
00:19:24,481 --> 00:19:29,481
I'm so disappointed in the whole way
this is laid out or the whole way this is

601
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:30,811
taking place.

602
00:19:30,811 --> 00:19:31,291
Don't do that.

603
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:34,470
Probably we're going to get flagged
flagged for changing its color.

604
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:34,870
Yeah.

605
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:36,340
We get flagged terrorist activities.

606
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:37,590
When you're looking at 10 lag,

607
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,433
Darwin,

608
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,020
we're not doing anything wrong.

609
00:19:40,021 --> 00:19:40,501
God Damn it.

610
00:19:40,501 --> 00:19:41,510
I pay my taxes and

611
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:44,430
protest against war.

612
00:19:44,431 --> 00:19:48,420
I can't believe you support a man who
would use chemicals to kill children.

613
00:19:48,421 --> 00:19:49,254
Good Polo.

614
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,130
Let's smoke them out in that
funny you support the other guy.

615
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:55,560
If you don't think that
you should fire missiles,

616
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:55,681
oh,

617
00:19:55,681 --> 00:19:56,341
now he's leaving.

618
00:19:56,341 --> 00:19:57,300
The same way came in.

619
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,230
Oh my God.

620
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:00,330
Nice and dramatic that just that alone.

621
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,910
All of this ready attrical
shit was orchestrated.

622
00:20:02,911 --> 00:20:03,540
Folks,

623
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:06,180
I guarantee you there are some
people that are involved in this.

624
00:20:06,181 --> 00:20:07,350
There's some producers.

625
00:20:07,351 --> 00:20:07,770
There's some,

626
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:09,900
there's an artistic director they want.

627
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:10,231
That was a,

628
00:20:10,231 --> 00:20:12,420
that was a well planned out scene.

629
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:13,463
He walks up,

630
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:14,850
he walks back.

631
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,150
The fact that they do it in this ancient
stupid house where supposedly lives.

632
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:18,751
Meanwhile,

633
00:20:18,751 --> 00:20:23,520
you know he's in some fucking seven mile
thick bunker down deep into the ground.

634
00:20:23,521 --> 00:20:27,150
The bowels of the Earth were Dick Cheney
was hiding all throughout the Iraq war.

635
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:27,810
Remember,

636
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:29,190
here's just a metal slide.

637
00:20:29,191 --> 00:20:30,810
He jumps in the shoot,

638
00:20:30,811 --> 00:20:31,900
like a laundry chute,

639
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:37,750
jumps in and slides through the lens and
the towels and just go some cell phone

640
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,950
off and surrounded by lizards
who are like excellent work.

641
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:41,630
Yeah,

642
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:42,510
it's Batman's layer.

643
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,000
It's about got Batman's layer or anything

644
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,000
[inaudible]

645
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:12,560
oh shit.

646
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:16,040
Itunes or recording to
server the fuck outta here.

647
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:16,610
Server.
