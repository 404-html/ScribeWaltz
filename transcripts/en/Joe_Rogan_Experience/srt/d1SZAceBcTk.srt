1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,833
Down

2
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:07,290
the Joe Rogan experience.

3
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,950
I got that book in the mail. You got
it. I got that book. The real man.

4
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:23,580
Have you been getting better?
I've been working on my real man skills,

5
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:26,910
Tommy bonds. This is Tom's
Segura, Ladies and Gentlemen,

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,990
Aka Tommy bonds from your mom's house
podcast and many other things. But uh,

7
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:33,630
he introduced me to a great man,

8
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:37,440
a man who wrote a book that every
man should read. What is his name?

9
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:42,420
He and Julian Ray. You, you nailed
it. And he wrote a book called, uh,

10
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,890
the real man, which might be the worst
book that anybody ever wrote. You know,

11
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,590
it's, it's epic on a lot of
levels. Do you know what I,

12
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:54,180
what I was thinking about after you left,
what it is that like every dude,

13
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:56,250
it really is his,

14
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:01,700
it's his game for getting laid was
making that he's the guy that goes like

15
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,470
ignore these guys that are there.

16
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:09,300
They're whistling at you and saying
things about the way I respect you.

17
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,590
But you know what I mean?

18
00:01:10,591 --> 00:01:15,180
Like it's that play to get laid and
writing that book is just his play to get

19
00:01:15,181 --> 00:01:18,750
pussy is what I'm saying. Right. It's his
plate to separate himself from the pack.

20
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:23,460
He's showing you his wisdom. Exactly. And
showing it and being like, I'm not a pig.

21
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:27,270
Right. Like these other guys. Everyone
else. I'm a different, we're over at,

22
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:31,230
what is that connected to try Castro.
So we're at Tommy's house.

23
00:01:31,231 --> 00:01:35,970
You see those yellow tabs if you don't
see this live, what he has is this thing.

24
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:37,290
Um,

25
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:41,940
there's this book where he has these
yellow tabs at virtually everything

26
00:01:41,941 --> 00:01:45,030
interesting in the book.
So they're overflowing with yellow tabs.

27
00:01:45,031 --> 00:01:49,500
It Tommy just goes to them
and just laughing as he's
going to each tab just like

28
00:01:49,501 --> 00:01:53,490
that. Every time you paint
your face, you're so happy.

29
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:55,323
I,

30
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,030
I started doing that cause I saw Oprah
do it with books when she had guests,

31
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,910
she was like, let me read you a passage
from your book. And so I was like,

32
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:06,360
I got to start marking my favorite
passages from this with posted notes.

33
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:07,920
That's a very clever way of doing it.

34
00:02:07,921 --> 00:02:12,921
There are three separate chapters in this
book that address just smelling good.

35
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:17,460
He has a chapter called smell.

36
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:22,700
He has a chapter called body odor
and a chapter called sanitation.

37
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:27,960
It's so ridiculous. It's crazy.
It's all basically don't smell bad.

38
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:33,210
That is so funny. Yeah. And that gave
me that book in person, you know? Yeah.

39
00:02:33,211 --> 00:02:36,380
He ran up to you in Hong Kong,
right? Yup. It's hilarious.

40
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:40,860
And then we found his dating
profile, uh, online. Did you,

41
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:45,930
did you get that too? No. Wow.
Yeah. He has a dating profile.

42
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:49,140
You don't need to mock this Joe more
than we ever, it's already having,

43
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:52,700
it feels cruel and I read it in full
on my podcast is dating profile.

44
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:58,560
He's been my plenty. He's probably like
every time he hears about it, he's like,

45
00:02:58,561 --> 00:03:00,010
that one fucking book.
Yup.

46
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,420
If I just didn't go up to him.
Yeah.

47
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:06,360
Gave that one guy in book one asshole.
Yeah. He says he dabbles in standup too.

48
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:08,430
Very good.
I bet he's hilarious.

49
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,460
He should be on the Ding Dong show. Yeah,
no, they didn't crush it there. Yeah,

50
00:03:14,461 --> 00:03:17,730
he would crush the Ding Dong show. There's
a lot of weird dudes out there, man.

51
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:22,710
There is. And you know I, that's the thing
is I actually was like, you know, he,

52
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:28,700
I really think that every
dude's personality to a
degree is developed as their

53
00:03:29,641 --> 00:03:33,270
play to get laid. You know what I mean?
Like everyone takes their, they're angled.

54
00:03:33,271 --> 00:03:34,920
Some are more genuine than others,
but he,

55
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:38,640
I think he really got into this cause he
thought this will be the way that I do

56
00:03:38,641 --> 00:03:42,060
it. You know, this is, this is my
way to get girls by writing a book,

57
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:46,800
telling everybody how to be. I think
so. I think I think it, and in his,

58
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:51,840
in his mind it'll show these
other ladies that like I'm,

59
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:56,220
I'm so respectful of women that
you should give me a chance.

60
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:59,350
That's how I see it. So respectful
that I'm published. Yeah.

61
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:02,490
Is there a miss like misspellings
in this book and everything?

62
00:04:02,491 --> 00:04:06,360
Cause I'm looking at all the
reviews, reviews, which are
all your fans? I can tell.

63
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:09,780
Yeah. It looks like he spelled birth
wrong or is, what's the breath thing?

64
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:11,790
Well does,
is there an e at the end?

65
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:16,020
It's part UTA breathe should be delicious.

66
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:21,160
Refreshing bad burrito. Yeah. I mean
there's, there's nine word chapters, so,

67
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:25,800
oh, there's not paragraphs. Yeah,

68
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:31,440
yeah, yeah. Poor guy. Well, you know what

69
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:35,150
man, maybe he enjoys it. Everybody's
got different frequency maybe to handle.

70
00:04:35,151 --> 00:04:36,960
He's like, I don't know what the
fuck these guys are talking about it.

71
00:04:36,961 --> 00:04:39,720
I nailed it. Yeah. I go over
that book with a fine tooth comb.

72
00:04:39,721 --> 00:04:41,460
I don't find any flaws.
Matter of fact,

73
00:04:41,461 --> 00:04:43,740
I think it might be the greatest
piece of literature ever created.

74
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:47,360
Yeah. And then people started,
uh, I think you said it,

75
00:04:47,361 --> 00:04:49,940
and then I got a bunch of emails,
people being like,

76
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:52,040
we have to make this in New York Times.

77
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:58,280
I bought it immediately. Amazon one
click to wells on your show. You know,

78
00:04:58,281 --> 00:04:59,540
he's been getting emails,

79
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,450
like notifying him of either
reviews or sales where he's like,

80
00:05:02,451 --> 00:05:03,650
this shit is finally taken off

81
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:09,950
waiting for this to take off.
And he just picked up this week.

82
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:13,010
It was like I've told you that story
about Joey Diaz hiding behind the curtains

83
00:05:13,011 --> 00:05:16,180
of the comedy store where this woman
was on stage as what I'm used to.

84
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:17,600
She used to bomb every week.

85
00:05:17,601 --> 00:05:20,960
She was open miker but she was one of
those open micros that was like always

86
00:05:20,961 --> 00:05:22,100
there.
She was always there.

87
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:25,100
She was there on a Friday
night and Saturday night
and like I think they kicked

88
00:05:25,101 --> 00:05:27,050
her out of the store. I don't think
he's allowed to go to the store anymore.

89
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:31,550
She was crazy. Anyway, she's on
stage and doing her usual jokes,

90
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:35,090
but Joey Diaz at snuck behind the stage
and it was back behind the curtain.

91
00:05:35,091 --> 00:05:39,170
He drops his pants and every
time she says a Punchline,

92
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:42,020
he opens the curtains
and people see his belly.

93
00:05:42,021 --> 00:05:46,460
His ball bag is tick and then he
closes the curtains and it's like,

94
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:50,080
it was the ultimate
like punch line machine.

95
00:05:50,081 --> 00:05:54,350
Larry's and she crushed
dude. She crushed. She was,

96
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:58,130
she was strutting on stage with
confidence. She was all of a sudden people

97
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:00,380
get it. Yeah, they finally get me.

98
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,500
It's so great that she, and then she
did. She find out right away or no,

99
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:08,690
she never found that to this day.

100
00:06:08,691 --> 00:06:11,650
I don't say her name when I talk about
it because I don't want people to know.

101
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:15,110
Maybe I said it once,
but most of the time I don't say her name

102
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:19,340
and you know though, but when she tells
people about stamps, she was like,

103
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:23,720
should have been there man. June
7th, 2003 while I was there.

104
00:06:23,721 --> 00:06:27,020
The next time she got on stage or one
of the next time she got so she got on

105
00:06:27,021 --> 00:06:28,980
stage and she's like, God, this audience,

106
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:34,400
all of a sudden it was like the
audience is fault. That's so funny.

107
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:37,370
There's such a funny thing
about like some of the,

108
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:42,700
I remember like some open Miker is there
unwavering dedication to sticking to

109
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:46,911
and like I'm saying,

110
00:06:46,911 --> 00:06:51,740
not like somebody who's developing like
who was horrific and they're just like,

111
00:06:51,741 --> 00:06:55,160
nope, every fucking time. How long you
been doing it? 19 years and you're like,

112
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:58,640
Jesus Christ. Well, you
know what it becomes man. It
becomes like their culture.

113
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:01,310
Like that's their hangout. Yeah,
that's true. They're there.

114
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,860
That is like amateur bowling night.

115
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:07,520
Like should you only bold if you're
going to be a professional bowler. Right.

116
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,070
You know,

117
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:11,630
I mean to someone who's like a serious
bowler and they watch some fuck heads

118
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:13,270
like you and I go to there,

119
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,010
you guys got her ball it and you
guys are taken up lanes, man.

120
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,830
Rolling in as hard as
you can. Yeah, totally

121
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:23,360
terrible bowling. But I'm going
to shop, put this shit down there.

122
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:27,360
Think about it man. We don't respect
that at all out of comedians. Right?

123
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:30,290
Like if you're a terrible bowler
and you go to the bowling alley,

124
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,540
the other bowl was like,
we have this fucking loser.

125
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:34,910
But if you're a terrible comedian,

126
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:40,060
a lot of people will look down
upon you with great judgement.

127
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:45,680
Disgust. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It happens.

128
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:47,930
I don't think that happens with bowlers.

129
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:52,400
I think so this gutter ball rolling bitch.
I think, I think it's probably like,

130
00:07:52,401 --> 00:07:56,090
you know, some Canadian comedians
would ignore somebody really bad.

131
00:07:56,091 --> 00:07:58,310
They're just be like, yeah,
that sometimes you can't,

132
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:01,970
you got to ignore him because then
they'll just corner you turn the corner,

133
00:08:01,971 --> 00:08:03,650
you know,
and they'll ask you what the secret is.

134
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:05,750
Like you gotta tell him where
the Leprechaun lives. Yeah.

135
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,620
How often do you get asked
where the secret is? I got
it. I bet it's quite a bit,

136
00:08:09,621 --> 00:08:13,090
right? Not really. No,
no. The secret, no, no,

137
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:16,640
like not even like a like emails,
dude, I'm starting out. Yeah,

138
00:08:16,641 --> 00:08:20,750
get those occasionally.
But my email is not very obvious.

139
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:25,760
And um, the other thing is
that even if I do get those,

140
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:29,150
like if, I don't know, he was
like, I can't tell you anything,

141
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:30,103
so what am I going to do?

142
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:34,130
There's very few things you could tell
someone who's like just starting out or

143
00:08:34,131 --> 00:08:37,700
someone who's not doing well or very
few things you can tell them. Well,

144
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:38,990
I usually not knowing them.

145
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:43,420
I used to say a lot more now I've got it
down to like a sentence. I mean, I'm, I'm,

146
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:46,320
I'm honest with it. I'm just like,
ride a lot, get on stage a lot. Like,

147
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:49,520
what else am I going to write a lot?
Get on stage a lot. Not only not,

148
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:52,160
there's some people that even if they
write a lot and get onstage a lot,

149
00:08:52,161 --> 00:08:54,740
for whatever reason, they're never going
to, they're never going to figure it out,

150
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:59,760
no matter it is. Whether it's being a
musician or being good at fucking bowling.

151
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:02,850
There's people that I played
pool with backline play pool.

152
00:09:02,851 --> 00:09:05,430
I played pool for years and these people
that never got any better than they

153
00:09:05,431 --> 00:09:09,090
were the first time I met him. That is
crazy. I mean, and I know it's not a,

154
00:09:09,091 --> 00:09:10,770
I'm not thinking about just those people,

155
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:14,760
but that is kind of a fascinating
thing where like they never get better.

156
00:09:14,761 --> 00:09:17,820
No progression. There's a lot of
people like that in martial arts.

157
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:19,750
There's like people like that. Yeah. Yeah.

158
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:21,290
There's a lot of people
that they would hit,

159
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:25,950
they would hit this like really low
level of proficiency where they certainly

160
00:09:25,951 --> 00:09:28,260
got better than the first day.
They weren't,

161
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:30,300
they weren't like they weren't the first
day but the only way to until like a

162
00:09:30,301 --> 00:09:33,810
certain level and then they just stopped.
They stopped picking on. Ah, it's,

163
00:09:33,811 --> 00:09:35,670
I don't think it's an
athletic talent thing.

164
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:39,930
I think it's like a focus thing or a
desire thing or that's something you

165
00:09:39,931 --> 00:09:44,931
realize as you get older is that some
people do not have the ability to hone in

166
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:49,500
and, and, and like zone focus
on something really hard.

167
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:51,930
Some people have an unbelievable,

168
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:57,110
like the best athletes have this
amazing ability to focus on their goal,

169
00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:01,260
on their training and what they're doing.
And then, you know, artists who like,

170
00:10:01,261 --> 00:10:05,490
they focus on their music on the writing
and I, I've noticed that the eye,

171
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:09,780
there's just people, friends in life
who they can't focus on anything.

172
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:14,520
Like they can't make their job,
uh, that, that they might like,

173
00:10:14,521 --> 00:10:19,440
or not like a big part of like, they're
wanting to get, they want to get,

174
00:10:19,441 --> 00:10:22,290
they want to progress, but they don't
know how to focus on getting better at it.

175
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:25,320
They're like, I wish I was
further along, but you're there.

176
00:10:25,321 --> 00:10:27,330
They're just so scrambled.
Yeah. At the time,

177
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:31,230
that's a really common thing
with comedians and they
pretend that they're not

178
00:10:31,231 --> 00:10:34,590
scrambled. Right. They're always want to
tell you how organized they are now. Yeah,

179
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:37,990
no, no. Yeah man, I got notes
now and everything book,

180
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:43,140
they do the same God damned material
every God damn week for years on end.

181
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:48,120
I got a guy in fucking guest spot
at a club and I shouldn't have.

182
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,520
And like, you know, I was
like give it like get get.

183
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:54,000
I was working in the club and I had
worked with him before and this lady was

184
00:10:54,001 --> 00:10:58,950
like, Oh shit. Well she goes, uh, so
he's, he's good. And I'm like, yeah, yeah,

185
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,680
the watch him.
And so he does that.

186
00:11:01,681 --> 00:11:05,940
He does this set on the first show was
like a Saturday night as a guest spot and

187
00:11:05,941 --> 00:11:08,760
he, it doesn't go well
and he was like, fuck,

188
00:11:08,761 --> 00:11:12,090
you know what I'm going to do is on the
second, cause there's a second show.

189
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:15,870
He was like, I'll do a whole other set.
And I was like, all right. And I go,

190
00:11:15,871 --> 00:11:18,140
well just watch it on the second show.
He's going to do a complete different set.

191
00:11:18,141 --> 00:11:20,910
Cause he, you know, he was like,
ah, that was just material.

192
00:11:20,911 --> 00:11:22,230
Do all this other material like,
okay.

193
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:27,180
And he just went up there and did the
exact same set as the first show and I was

194
00:11:27,181 --> 00:11:28,014
like,

195
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:32,220
you like you spend 10 minutes explaining
to me how you were going to do all

196
00:11:32,221 --> 00:11:35,670
different material? He was like,
yeah, I dunno. I Dunno what happened.

197
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:40,430
He panicked, he panicked,
he backed it. Didn't,

198
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,990
didn't feel comfortable
enough to to do it. Well,

199
00:11:42,991 --> 00:11:46,560
sometimes when you're doing standup,
especially when you're new,

200
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:51,860
there's this mindset where you're so
worried about the response that you're

201
00:11:52,531 --> 00:11:55,390
almost it.
Or you're telling the joke,

202
00:11:55,391 --> 00:12:00,050
which distracts from your focus of the
joke, which makes the joke back and you,

203
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:03,910
you get into super nervous and then
you'd go into this weird shell and that's

204
00:12:03,911 --> 00:12:07,390
when guys start busting out like really
familiar material just to try to get

205
00:12:07,391 --> 00:12:09,990
back on track or to get on
track. That's true. Yeah.

206
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:12,580
So that's probably what he did. Yeah.
Yeah. You're right. And then he couldn't,

207
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:13,540
I think he probably,

208
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:18,580
he probably started with one joke from
the first side and then when that didn't

209
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:21,790
like make him feel comfortable, he goes,
I'll just keep doing the first set.

210
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:24,700
He never felt comfortable enough to
switch it up. We know what guests,

211
00:12:24,701 --> 00:12:26,380
that's the problem with
those things are to,

212
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:29,410
a lot of them are by dudes
who don't work that much.

213
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:31,480
So when they go up it's a big deal.

214
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:35,860
So then they fucking panic because it's
a sold out room like on a Friday night

215
00:12:35,861 --> 00:12:40,000
or something like that or yeah, I
stopped giving those out a long time ago.

216
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:44,070
That's too many disasters.
I saw some God damn disastrous.

217
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,280
Yeah. Friends, you know,
you let them up like yeah,

218
00:12:48,281 --> 00:12:51,340
I'm starting to do standup again. Really?
How long have you been doing it? Wow.

219
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:56,190
Went up last week. Went well, you know
like, all right, go ahead. I hate I,

220
00:12:56,191 --> 00:13:00,550
I'll tell you this, this something that
totally changed and it's because of like,

221
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:05,080
like just practice at anything. Changes
how you do you know, how you do anything.

222
00:13:05,081 --> 00:13:06,880
And you know,
when I first started out,

223
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:11,650
all my sets were seven minutes and then
10 minutes and 15 minutes and you know,

224
00:13:11,651 --> 00:13:12,484
and so on.

225
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:17,670
And there was a point where like I
could do like just crazy good solid 10

226
00:13:19,151 --> 00:13:23,170
minutes sets.
And then now for the last couple of years,

227
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:27,430
the majority of the time I'm on stage,
it's like an hour. Like that's what I,

228
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:31,150
you know, you go up there and you do
an hour. Now when I do a 10 minute set,

229
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:35,410
I'm like, like what the fuck am I going
to do in 10 minutes? You panic. Yeah.

230
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:38,980
Kind of like, I really like start to like
figure like what? And then you're like,

231
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:41,180
what should I take out
of the hour to do here?

232
00:13:41,181 --> 00:13:44,590
Or how do I introduce a new 10 minutes?
It's a whole different thing for me now.

233
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:47,560
That's why it's really hard for people
to do TV shows like Letterman or

234
00:13:47,561 --> 00:13:51,070
something like that. You're doing
five minutes. I've done it twice.

235
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:54,280
I've done not Letterman, but I'd done
Conan and I've done the late, late show.

236
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:59,200
And uh, absolutely. It's like,
and then, and both of them,

237
00:13:59,201 --> 00:14:01,950
there's a guy behind the camera
who's circling hits me like,

238
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:05,710
will you wrap this shit up? You're at
five minutes and eight seconds. Like,

239
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:09,010
that's long, you know, so he's like this
and you're just like ignore, ignore,

240
00:14:09,011 --> 00:14:12,630
ignore, ignore, ignore that. Yeah.
It's distracting. It's fuck yeah,

241
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:16,630
he's just trying to get that, you know,
do his job. But yeah, a lot of those,

242
00:14:16,631 --> 00:14:19,780
just trying to do my job.
People that are no Yang.

243
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:21,490
When Ari was filming his special,

244
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:23,830
there was some fucking dude
that was working the camera.

245
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:27,310
He was talking like this,
like in the back of the comedy store,

246
00:14:27,311 --> 00:14:29,840
which is about as he's shooting
10 foot deep, you know,

247
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:33,490
how big is the fucking comic store?
It's a small place and this guy,

248
00:14:33,491 --> 00:14:36,730
that camera's are moving back and forth,
they decided to have cameras on dollies.

249
00:14:36,731 --> 00:14:38,170
Like they way over produced it.

250
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:41,530
You need to just set some cameras
up in the corners, set him up,

251
00:14:41,531 --> 00:14:45,790
get a static shot. You don't have to keep
moving around the room like this stop.

252
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,430
But they did it anyway.
Right. So they did it.

253
00:14:48,431 --> 00:14:52,250
And this guy was like directing
things. So he's in the back. Yeah.

254
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:55,310
Lenny zoom in left zoom in. Laugh.
I mean, and I'm not kidding.

255
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:56,960
There's a lot of people
were like what the fuck?

256
00:14:56,961 --> 00:15:00,860
Like we are turn around and I had to
talk to people. I go, what is this?

257
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:03,200
Why is this guy so loud? And they
were like, he's been doing it.

258
00:15:03,201 --> 00:15:05,450
We tried to tell him to talk like
the people that worked the door,

259
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:08,270
we tried to tell him to tone it down
but he didn't want to tone it down.

260
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,910
Cause you've got to talk to these people
that have the cameras, right? Yeah.

261
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:14,600
Cause they have to hear him clearly over
the laughter. So he's talking like this.

262
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:17,830
It's so distracting.
And that's the guy until you can,

263
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:20,360
I can already tell that like the,
you know,

264
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:22,340
the more people that would tell
them to quiet down, he's like,

265
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:24,110
you want to do my job?
Yeah, you want to do this.

266
00:15:24,111 --> 00:15:27,200
I don't know if it was like that at
all. I didn't, I didn't talk to him.

267
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:32,420
But you tell anywhere to zoom in and then
they don't need to move on dollies and

268
00:15:32,421 --> 00:15:35,660
shit like everybody wants to over
fucking produce these things,

269
00:15:35,661 --> 00:15:39,700
but actually the central bank put a
camera side Bang, Buck Cameron aside.

270
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:43,370
Bank don't usually use the cameras on
the side unless there's something weird

271
00:15:43,371 --> 00:15:46,540
going on. Sure. Focus on that camera
to seeing the need for a special,

272
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:49,370
it's like a wide, immediate, I want a
tight shot. It's really all you need.

273
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:51,680
They want to add all kinds
of crafty shit to it.

274
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:54,350
Like they didn't even let the comedy
store would be the comedy store when I got

275
00:15:54,351 --> 00:15:57,230
there. There's all these crazy lights on
the side of the stage and it was just,

276
00:15:57,650 --> 00:16:01,310
it was weird. They like changed the
lighting. I was like, you, you guys,

277
00:16:01,311 --> 00:16:03,260
doctors end up, this is not this. Why not?

278
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,060
If you're going to be at the comedy store,

279
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:06,950
don't you think he should
look like the comedy store?

280
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,820
That was the point of
being there. Yeah. Why?

281
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:11,510
Why is the comedy store with these
fucking landing lights next to it?

282
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:16,410
Why is the room read? I do like
the trend. I think it's, you know,

283
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:19,940
it's become a trend now to have
to go back to clubs for specials.

284
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:24,110
I like it a lot. I love doing mine in
a club. It was my favorite special,

285
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:27,830
that's the best club dude
that closes the best club.

286
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:31,430
There's like four the best clubs, but
that's one of them. That's one of them.

287
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:34,970
Helium in Portland's, one of the
best clubs. Helium in Philly.

288
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:39,200
That's one of the best clubs. Like re
acme in Minneapolis. I never did that.

289
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:42,320
You never did acme? No
one's there. Ridiculous.

290
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:46,100
I went there once when arch arch
barker was performing. Really? Yeah.

291
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,640
You'll lose your mind. It's looked
amazing. It's just like those clubs,

292
00:16:49,641 --> 00:16:54,530
just like comedy works downtown. Uh, go
bananas. Cincinnati. That's a good one.

293
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:58,430
What else? What are the good ones?
Are there, um, let me think. Oh,

294
00:16:58,431 --> 00:17:01,430
danger fields in New York City. You
ever do that and never did that? Ooh,

295
00:17:01,431 --> 00:17:02,970
that's a good one.
It's dark.

296
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:06,740
That's an evil club or some fucking
satanic shit going on. That really, yeah.

297
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:08,840
You know,
I mean it might just be literally,

298
00:17:08,841 --> 00:17:13,690
it might just be like when something
like stays around too long. Yeah, sure.

299
00:17:13,691 --> 00:17:16,130
I just,
he just soaks up weird vibes.

300
00:17:16,131 --> 00:17:18,530
Like the comedy store definitely
has weird vibes in it.

301
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:22,490
There's a weird vibe to that place.
And danger fields has a weird vibe too.

302
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:27,350
Although danger fields for the longest
time didn't have like the best comedians.

303
00:17:27,351 --> 00:17:30,500
It how like, I dunno how it is now,
but when I was there it was like,

304
00:17:30,501 --> 00:17:32,750
there was some real good ones.
There was the occasional good one,

305
00:17:32,751 --> 00:17:34,880
but there was a lot of
like really bad comics.

306
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:39,170
There were literally didn't work
anywhere else in the city. Yeah. Yeah.

307
00:17:39,171 --> 00:17:41,750
It's on the east side somewhere. I
don't remember where it is, but I did,

308
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:45,680
I did that place a lot. And that's another
one. They like, they filmed, uh, the uh,

309
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:47,720
Rodney Dangerfield comedy special there,

310
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:51,420
his HBO comedy special where they can
feel that danger fields. Yeah. Wow. Yeah.

311
00:17:51,421 --> 00:17:53,820
They filmed it with
Kennison and I think dice,

312
00:17:53,821 --> 00:17:56,140
I think Dyson Kennison we're on the
same amount when they shot that.

313
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:59,730
I didn't know that. I've seen
that one. Yeah, it was. It
was Dyson Kennison and no,

314
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:03,210
no dice was with Bill Hicks,
right? Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

315
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:06,420
Pretty sure dice was with Bill Hicks.
Kinison was on a different one,

316
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:10,320
but either way they filmed the Kinison
one there at danger fields and it's just

317
00:18:10,321 --> 00:18:11,154
perfect.

318
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:15,110
It's just a small stage in a small room
and everybody's shoved in there tight

319
00:18:15,111 --> 00:18:18,470
and it's all dark and mysterious hand
jobs going on throughout the room.

320
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:23,770
It's a dark place, you know? It's just
weird. It's a weird place, man. There's,

321
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:26,670
there's that. There's a, there's
a few. There's a few like,

322
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:29,640
let me think of some other ones that
are really good comedy magic club.

323
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:32,770
Pretty God damn good. It's a
great, it's a great club with,

324
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:37,170
and the Ice House is the best room of all
time. Ice House. It's stupid number one.

325
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:38,123
That's number one.

326
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:43,140
That Morgan main room and people like
a more even more people in La Comics.

327
00:18:43,801 --> 00:18:45,420
I'm saying,
you know,

328
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:48,750
everyone complains about how far like
it's not that you should be going there

329
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:51,930
all the time, they're wheezing. It's
20 minutes away. You wouldn't bitch.

330
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:57,720
Is the best. It's the best setup
in the country and the staff,

331
00:18:57,790 --> 00:19:00,870
they're the nicest people on earth.
It's the coolest. Yeah, they're so nice.

332
00:19:00,871 --> 00:19:04,500
Everyone is just all hugs and laughs
and they're all sexually harassing each

333
00:19:04,501 --> 00:19:06,690
other. It's hilarious. They are hilarious.

334
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:10,530
Should be girls are mocking the
dude's penis is like openly.

335
00:19:10,531 --> 00:19:13,350
I came out of it do the green room
and they were like mocking each other.

336
00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:14,220
I was like,
this is hilarious.

337
00:19:14,221 --> 00:19:18,060
But they were laughing and we when
people like work at comedy clubs too,

338
00:19:18,061 --> 00:19:22,290
a lot of times they have like
the whole like PR thing or a HR.

339
00:19:22,291 --> 00:19:23,970
Human resources never
really comes into play.

340
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:27,210
Never was used to hearing
about people gagging on Cox,

341
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:30,610
you know like over and over
again. How can we show, yeah,

342
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:33,990
so he works during the
weekend it was fucking,

343
00:19:33,991 --> 00:19:36,870
you were watching like five
fisting jokes and everything. Yeah.

344
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,950
What do you get a complaint
and so everybody's always
there. They're more like,

345
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:45,060
what's the word you would use
loose with their dialogue.

346
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:49,680
I can imagine the a staff person like at
a club like that and then they go over

347
00:19:49,681 --> 00:19:53,610
to Applebee's and people are probably
like, Yo, what is up with you?

348
00:19:53,611 --> 00:19:54,540
And all your cum joke.

349
00:19:56,910 --> 00:19:59,670
They're trying to serve the fucking
Jack Daniels taking strength.

350
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:03,840
Fucking told him down. Some of my favorite
people work in comedy clubs. Yeah,

351
00:20:03,841 --> 00:20:05,400
they're great man.
It's a special breed.

352
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:09,840
That's another thing that we need to
realize as comedians if very important

353
00:20:09,841 --> 00:20:12,060
thing that I try to tell as
many young guys as possible.

354
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:15,420
Everybody always wants to think that
there's some sort of an adversarial

355
00:20:15,421 --> 00:20:17,550
relationship between
you and the comedy club.

356
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:19,290
Especially in the beginning guys like,
oh,

357
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:21,660
they're not paying me enough money
or they don't give me good weekends,

358
00:20:21,661 --> 00:20:23,310
are they this and that and that and this.

359
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:28,260
There's always going to be
person to person conflicts.

360
00:20:28,261 --> 00:20:31,800
But here's what's important. If comedy
clubs weren't around, we'd be fucked.

361
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,200
So we need people to run comedy clubs.
Yeah.

362
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:38,880
And guess who's not going to run comedy
clubs? Yeah. Yeah, us. Right. Okay.

363
00:20:38,881 --> 00:20:42,300
We need those fucking videos.
They're very important and they're not us.

364
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:46,020
They're different.
So imagine being a non comedian,

365
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:48,070
working with a bunch fucking nutty

366
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:51,880
comedians all the time with other crazy
problems and their addictions and their

367
00:20:51,881 --> 00:20:56,020
excuses and showing up late or Eva's
and shooting heroin on stage, you know,

368
00:20:56,370 --> 00:21:00,630
or whatever the fuck they do. Well, my
shoes, that craziness you hit every year.

369
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:02,380
We've all seen people's riders.

370
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:06,300
You know where they have a fresh pair
of shoes backstage far I've seen writers

371
00:21:06,301 --> 00:21:07,840
were big dudes.
Had a fresh pair of sneakers.

372
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:09,430
You imagine if you had
to deal with this shit,

373
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:11,020
I got to give this guy fucking sneakers.

374
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:15,070
He's gonna have his size 11 Jordan's in
the box right there waiting before he

375
00:21:15,071 --> 00:21:18,610
goes on stage. He slips them on right
before he goes up. That's his ritual.

376
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:23,220
Green m and M's. You fuck
only Green Asians, you know
they're always doing stuff.

377
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:28,720
I was going to say Pakistani. I guess
that's Asia. That is Asia. That's true.

378
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:33,900
I did a race at club where they had, um,
they had a play station and when I got,

379
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:36,850
I was like, that's the shit.
Thanks dude. And they're like,

380
00:21:36,851 --> 00:21:40,900
we got it for fucking asshole.
Who made us buy ones.

381
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:45,720
So he would do his shows. So enjoy, let
it go out and buy a fucking playstation.

382
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:49,330
Yeah. See Man, if you were a
regular person, just trying
to run a little business,

383
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:52,600
I maybe there'll be a fun business.
I'm in the restaurant bar business.

384
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:54,880
Maybe I'd like to run a
comedy club. Be Fun. Right.

385
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:58,540
And then Joey Diaz is calling
you from Vegas. Listen dog,

386
00:21:58,541 --> 00:22:01,880
you've got a wide is money you got
watch this money. We got no show. Cox,

387
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:06,850
Joey and his crazy days.
I mean anybody. I mean,

388
00:22:06,851 --> 00:22:10,690
think of the comedy nightmare stories
that we've heard about comedians doing

389
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:15,580
stupid shit to a club or two club
owner. Dude. I remember. Yeah, I know.

390
00:22:15,581 --> 00:22:18,400
I was like, I did. I remember I did a
club years ago. I get to the condom,

391
00:22:18,401 --> 00:22:22,090
like how's The condo looking?
And they're like, well the uh,

392
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:26,380
the guy that just left, he
shaved his pubes in the, in
the sink. And I'm like, dude,

393
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:29,050
I wish you would not have told
me that. And then, you know,

394
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:31,990
so and so left a piece
of salmon under the bed.

395
00:22:31,991 --> 00:22:35,560
So the whole place would smell like fish.
Oh Brendan Walsh.

396
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:39,640
People do shit like that,
man.

397
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,060
And here's the other thing they do
when people get out of the clubs,

398
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:45,580
there's a thing that they do
when they like go to theaters,

399
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:49,060
they almost like despise clubs. Then I
remember to go back and work the club.

400
00:22:49,061 --> 00:22:53,530
I worked at a theater. They have this
like weird image thing. Yeah. What's that?

401
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:58,080
Why would you be ashamed to
clubs? That's all ego could. Yeah.

402
00:22:58,630 --> 00:23:03,250
And the whole thing is
like for 90% maybe more.

403
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:06,280
If you do make the leap
from clubs at theaters,

404
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:08,530
you're still going to go
back to like your drought.

405
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:10,600
Almost everyone's draw dips again.

406
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:13,630
Well Louie CK has one coming out that he
did at the comedy store and that's one

407
00:23:13,631 --> 00:23:17,350
of the things that he talked about. He's
like, you know, cause he does arenas now.

408
00:23:17,351 --> 00:23:21,040
I mean there's like Madison Square
Garden, he's like 14,000 people. Right.

409
00:23:21,041 --> 00:23:23,270
So he does that. He does theaters. Yeah.

410
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:26,740
Anywhere between like a
thousand and you know, whatever.

411
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:30,280
And then he also does the clubs, which
is everything we would consider. Like,

412
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:32,590
I think a clubs like below five,

413
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:35,590
everything below 500 like even
like that place in Phoenix.

414
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:39,770
That's kind of like a comedy club
slash. Theater, which is a great room.

415
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:44,140
That's my favorite. I think
that's my favorite big room.
Big Room in the country.

416
00:23:44,141 --> 00:23:47,680
I liked that one a, it's pretty God
damn good. San Jose. That's not even,

417
00:23:47,681 --> 00:23:49,930
you can't even be considered
a comedy club candidate.

418
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:56,150
It's an old theater. It doesn't have
quite, it's over four but so you know,

419
00:23:56,151 --> 00:23:57,620
you could technically
be like it was a club,

420
00:23:57,621 --> 00:23:59,270
but it doesn't have the layout of a club.

421
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:02,720
It looks like actually like a beautiful
historic theater theater. Yeah. Yeah.

422
00:24:02,721 --> 00:24:05,690
That place is amazing. That's a
beautiful thing. I just did West Palm.

423
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:10,460
I did it one night there last week
and this giant, giant 700 people.

424
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:13,160
John deets, halfway through.
So that pathway through,

425
00:24:13,161 --> 00:24:16,280
if you're too far away and
just look at a TV like a UFC,

426
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:20,060
and I did Irvine last month. I
did a night. They're a giant ones.

427
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:22,520
I'm doing that in June.
I'm doing a weekend there in June.

428
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:27,800
So it places enormous man at that is
probably the best run comedy club.

429
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:32,360
Like they that's got Daniel's face. Yeah.
They know problems. Know their shit.

430
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:35,240
They know what else too. There's
like a lot of comedy fans out there,

431
00:24:35,241 --> 00:24:37,240
but they've cultivated that
over years and years. Yeah.

432
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:40,400
And it's hard for them to get it
at a town. Getting into town sucks.

433
00:24:40,401 --> 00:24:44,890
A Fat Dick if you live in Irvine. Yeah.
Irvine, it's fucking far like that.

434
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:48,200
Might as well be San Diego.
You might as well be.

435
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:51,050
The difference between getting to Irvine
and San Diego is just leaving the house

436
00:24:51,051 --> 00:24:53,690
a little earlier.
If you,

437
00:24:53,691 --> 00:24:56,750
if you leave the house at
three and try to get to Irvine,

438
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:59,900
it's like leaving the house at two
and trying to get to San Diego.

439
00:24:59,901 --> 00:25:04,620
It is there the same time.
Yeah. I mean you really will.
It's hours. Oh my God. Yeah.

440
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:08,270
Yeah. If you, but if you miss that
traffic, it's crazy. If you miss it,

441
00:25:08,271 --> 00:25:11,660
you just like, I'm here an hour and a half
early. Yeah. What the fuck? That's crazy.

442
00:25:11,661 --> 00:25:13,730
You can't miss it.
But I don't know what that time is.

443
00:25:13,731 --> 00:25:16,850
There's like a 11 o'clock to one
o'clock window of opportunity.

444
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:19,940
When I was emceeing I would,
uh, and I had an Irvine weekend.

445
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:24,110
I would leave at like fucking one in
the afternoon and I just really, yeah,

446
00:25:24,111 --> 00:25:26,510
just hang out and do some work,
you know,

447
00:25:26,511 --> 00:25:30,560
get your notebook out over some jokes and
better than freaking out in traffic at

448
00:25:30,561 --> 00:25:33,230
five 45 stopped dead going.
How long is this going to last?

449
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:35,510
What if this is another hours?
It's fucking a show.

450
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:40,400
I only missed my set one time in my
whole entire career and it was emceeing

451
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:45,290
Ontario years ago when it rained,
so it rained. So you know,

452
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,820
everything gets backed up a little bit.

453
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:52,100
Like traffic gets worse and
I left La Hollywood at like,

454
00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:57,610
it was like a eight o'clock show and
I left at like six to go to Ontario.

455
00:25:58,210 --> 00:26:02,540
I got when I, when I ran in the feature
was like, all right, thanks everybody.

456
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:06,910
I was like, Shit, I missed
my set completely. Whoa.
Just, you know. But yeah,

457
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:11,470
I mean this town teaches you to
leave way earlier than you should.

458
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:15,290
It'd be like in 10 years when there's
even more people. Yeah, they're going to,

459
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:19,010
they're going to keep going unless
there's some sort of a natural disaster.

460
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:22,400
Ellie is going to continue to grow
unless there is a one of them,

461
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:26,300
the rock earthquakes like this movie
he's got coming out. Oh yeah, San Andres.

462
00:26:26,301 --> 00:26:26,511
Right.

463
00:26:26,511 --> 00:26:29,600
It would take some shit like that and
then everybody's just going to overrun

464
00:26:29,601 --> 00:26:33,500
Colorado. Then everybody's just going to
move to Colorado. People have like um,

465
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:38,630
you know these, they proposed that like
nothing would be better for, for earth,

466
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:43,230
like a, a significant wipe
out of a certain percentage
of the population. Right.

467
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,160
Like for everything.

468
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:47,490
I mean that's very short
sighted on Earth's point.
Yeah. Cause I would say earth,

469
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:51,030
listen, we're the only ones out of
all the shit that you got growing,

470
00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:54,120
the only ones it might be able to figure
out how to dive or to fucking asteroid.

471
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:56,260
So watch your mouth bitch.
Yeah.

472
00:26:56,780 --> 00:27:00,720
Cause you want to talk to you want us
out there fucking and making computers.

473
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,940
Yeah.
We throw some shit in the ocean.

474
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:05,490
We'll figure that out in a couple
of generations. But what we,

475
00:27:05,491 --> 00:27:10,110
what we're doing is we're paying attention
to factors. Rocks above you. Yeah. Yeah.

476
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:11,820
Bitch,
bitch earth.

477
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:16,250
You weren't fucking whining bit human
beings worried about a natural disaster.

478
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:18,600
Be The best thing to happen
to Earth. Yeah. How, how,

479
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:21,720
how much of a natural disaster?
Fuck Ed, because you got hit by,

480
00:27:21,721 --> 00:27:24,810
you forgot about this. You got
hit by a planet once. Yeah.

481
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:27,720
These are just got hit by a Goddamn
planet at one point in time.

482
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:32,400
How long ago before your time? Like a
hundred years ago. It's like 18, 90,

483
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:35,630
72 before slavery was abolished.
Okay.

484
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:38,440
The guy was trying to wipe out
slavery with Earth, with another,

485
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:40,670
with another planet.
Planet came, I think, um,

486
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:45,920
I think it was like a billion years
into Earth's life cycle as a back

487
00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:51,151
imagine though,

488
00:27:51,151 --> 00:27:54,710
if you saw a planet in the sky and was
slowly coming towards us and it's trying

489
00:27:54,711 --> 00:27:57,330
to Merce like, ah, we've
got a rogue planet.

490
00:27:57,660 --> 00:28:00,820
There's a rogue planet headed our way.
Yeah.

491
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:03,960
And we have two years to do
with this. Oh, by the way,

492
00:28:03,961 --> 00:28:05,220
we lied about going to the moon.

493
00:28:05,221 --> 00:28:09,180
We've never actually really landed
anywhere other than earth. Sorry.

494
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:12,030
And then as the planet gets close to
people, like where's it going to hit?

495
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:16,110
The key players like changing like where
they think it's going to hit and then

496
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:19,680
it lands them in. They're like, it's going
to be North Korea. I was like, all right,

497
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:24,800
it's going to hit so hard that even
if you do leave now on a spaceship,

498
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:29,760
the aftershocks impact will below
your spaceship apart in space.

499
00:28:29,761 --> 00:28:34,380
So it's pointless to leave
just every day. Maria, chaos,

500
00:28:34,381 --> 00:28:38,940
machetes, billion fire. I'll all
still be gone though. Dance parties,

501
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,940
they would still be in their rockets
like, fuck it. I'm going to do it anyways.

502
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,470
We try. I think so. Yeah.

503
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:46,770
I think we could reinforce the
outside and beat the shockwaves.

504
00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:49,460
I've done my own
calculations, Roger. Absolute.

505
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:53,040
Maybe one guy just thinks it'd be
cute to get that guy up in space.

506
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:56,940
Paul Allen would be up there. You
think so? Why? Watching from above?

507
00:28:57,420 --> 00:29:00,840
You guys are fucked. I can see it.
Come on a be that guy though, man.

508
00:29:00,841 --> 00:29:05,730
You don't want to be alone in space with
$1 billion. No, that sounds so fucking,

509
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:10,230
that's so depressing to think about.
I would way rather die. Yeah. Way.

510
00:29:10,231 --> 00:29:12,960
Rob with the rest of us. Fuck yeah. Yeah.

511
00:29:12,961 --> 00:29:17,010
I don't want to live in space and
some tiny community that, you know,

512
00:29:17,011 --> 00:29:21,900
it was trying to suck water out of rocks
on Mars. No, no, that sounds so stupid.

513
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:25,960
Like this.
W you know how long people have worked to,

514
00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:29,010
to turn earth into what
you can enjoy right now.

515
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:34,400
This has been a long process to get the
2015 and you're just kinda just gonna

516
00:29:34,621 --> 00:29:39,510
bypass all that and shoot yourself off
in space like an asshole. Somebody would,

517
00:29:39,511 --> 00:29:41,530
you know, they would. Somebody would,

518
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:43,840
you would have to be,

519
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:47,620
we would have to be like thousands of
years more advanced than we are now to a

520
00:29:47,621 --> 00:29:50,350
point where we could like change
the atmosphere of a planet.

521
00:29:50,351 --> 00:29:54,160
Like we could land on Mars and
do something like what does that,

522
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:58,870
there's a term scientific term for when
they reintroduce oxygen to an atmosphere

523
00:29:58,871 --> 00:30:02,620
of a planet. I forget what
it is, but they've, they,

524
00:30:02,621 --> 00:30:07,210
they've developed machines that
they, uh, could theoretically, oh,

525
00:30:07,211 --> 00:30:09,510
photo genesis. No, that's, I know,

526
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:13,930
I'm just ask them how they think it's
just of you, you're good looking,

527
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:20,040
but whatever that uh, that,
that term is, um, they're,

528
00:30:20,041 --> 00:30:24,310
they eventually want to do that to like
Mars. They eventually want to fly there,

529
00:30:24,311 --> 00:30:28,230
set up these gigantic gas
making machines and you know,

530
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:32,230
somehow or another makeup oxygen. It is
cool. Like, you know, that, you know,

531
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:37,150
we can't even wrap our heads around
how amazing it will be. Like, uh,

532
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:40,060
the, how, you know, in thousands of years,

533
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:43,000
like we can't wrap our heads
around what life is going to be,

534
00:30:43,001 --> 00:30:46,930
but we do have the benefit of looking
back and seeing like how much better our

535
00:30:46,931 --> 00:30:51,640
lives are then every generation before
I'm talking about just quality of life.

536
00:30:51,670 --> 00:30:55,480
Oh yeah. Like how hard life used to
be two, it's just, it's so, you know,

537
00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:57,530
and you'd look at lifespans,
you know,

538
00:30:57,531 --> 00:31:01,390
when people live in to their thirties
was an average lifespan a long time.

539
00:31:01,391 --> 00:31:01,901
But you know what I mean?

540
00:31:01,901 --> 00:31:05,500
Like you got married and you had
your kid at 13 and that was standard.

541
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:09,280
And then everybody got a cold and
you're like, well, he's dead. He died.

542
00:31:09,281 --> 00:31:12,890
It was cold. That's what happens. You
get cold and you're getting your diet.

543
00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:15,430
It was horrific.
And not only that,

544
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:18,040
like what we're talking about
was a hundred years ago. Yeah.

545
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,900
That's what's really been
at us, dude. You know what?

546
00:31:19,901 --> 00:31:21,730
I always think about air conditioning,

547
00:31:22,690 --> 00:31:26,170
like how fucking normal that is to us.
How you're like,

548
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:30,420
it's a hundred out and you walk in, you're
like, everything's fine now. Like it's,

549
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:34,150
it feels tangible and you watch TV and
your underwear picking your balls and

550
00:31:34,151 --> 00:31:36,640
your like. Meanwhile, you could not
bad at all food on your driveway,

551
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:38,530
literally cook food in your driveway.

552
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:41,620
And then of course the reality of
there's some people who don't have that

553
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:45,190
obviously still who are like, you're
like Jesus. Imagine right now,

554
00:31:45,191 --> 00:31:48,910
if I didn't have that,
like how in the worst hot day,

555
00:31:48,911 --> 00:31:53,911
how horrific the quality of life becomes
like SIGNiX like Phoenix in the summer.

556
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:59,260
It's brutal. Vegas, Phoenix, Vegas in
the summer. It's insane. It's insane.

557
00:31:59,290 --> 00:32:03,250
Yeah. It's hard to imagine that
anybody can endure those temperatures.

558
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:07,510
Remember doing gigs in Vegas July,
August, where like you're at,

559
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:11,680
you're at one casino, you know,
whatever, the Bellagio and you're like,

560
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:15,370
I'm going to walk to the next one.
Just the next one.

561
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,940
What did you forget?
You forget how the size,

562
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:23,950
the magnet of just the buildings.
Yeah. And that, that next one is,

563
00:32:24,130 --> 00:32:26,890
I don't know, a quarter mile or
something. Maybe a little more than that.

564
00:32:26,891 --> 00:32:29,050
That that's how far the night.
That's not far to go,

565
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:33,040
but when it's one 24
outside and you're just,

566
00:32:33,041 --> 00:32:35,770
you're walking down and you get there,
you're like, I'm a check into this hotel.

567
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:40,150
Like I'm not even go back to my old
hotel cause it is a fucking Rudel adds

568
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:41,130
insane.
Yes.

569
00:32:41,131 --> 00:32:45,020
I got hair dryer blowing in your face
all day and there's homeless people.

570
00:32:45,021 --> 00:32:47,900
They're like, they live in
that. Do you think you adapt?

571
00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:50,990
I think you do adapt to a certain
degree because human beings,

572
00:32:50,991 --> 00:32:53,600
we're just so resilient and you just,
you do adapt to things.

573
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:57,830
But I think there's also people
you're like, you know, they die.

574
00:32:57,950 --> 00:33:01,610
And why know that Eskimos or you're
supposed to call him Inuits. They,

575
00:33:01,611 --> 00:33:03,830
their hands have adapted
to deal with the cold.

576
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:06,890
Like they don't get numb hands
like we would if we went up there.

577
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:09,530
Really there's circulations different,
their skin's different.

578
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:14,360
And I also know that like my friend Steve
Rinella was just in Bolivia and he has

579
00:33:14,361 --> 00:33:16,210
a podcast,
the meat eater podcast.

580
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:18,530
He's talking about this trip to
Bolivia was pretty fascinating.

581
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:19,940
One of the things that
we're talking about us,

582
00:33:19,941 --> 00:33:22,760
how it was really hot down
there and really everything.

583
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:25,160
Everybody was sweaty except the natives,

584
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:28,340
the native Toumani who or I think
that's how you say the name.

585
00:33:28,730 --> 00:33:31,220
They didn't sweat like to them it wasn't,

586
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:35,190
it wasn't a hot that's under there
were used to it like everybody else's

587
00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:38,120
drenched with sweat and these guys
are like barely drinking water.

588
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:40,280
You drink a little sip of water every
now and then, but you look at them,

589
00:33:40,281 --> 00:33:43,010
they're not, they're not glistening
with sweat like everybody else.

590
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:47,030
It's amazing how quick the adapt
and the change happens too.

591
00:33:47,031 --> 00:33:51,080
I remember like for the
first 1314 years of my life,

592
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:54,800
I lived in cities that had cold winters,
Cincinnati,

593
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:57,050
Milwaukee,
Minneapolis,

594
00:33:57,350 --> 00:34:02,350
and we moved from Milwaukee to
Florida in November and in November,

595
00:34:04,370 --> 00:34:08,030
sometimes in Florida it'll get all the
way down into the 50s like in south

596
00:34:08,031 --> 00:34:09,050
Florida,
right?

597
00:34:09,051 --> 00:34:13,880
So I go to school the first few days and
kids have sweat shirts and jackets on

598
00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:15,560
and I'm in a tee shirt and shorts.

599
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:20,090
We've just moved from Milwaukee where
it's like three that day. Right?

600
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:23,210
So people look to me and they're like,
are you out of your fucking mind?

601
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:25,970
Like what are you doing? Why? Why
are you doing this? And I'm like,

602
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:30,470
this is the best day I've had in a
month. Like this is, this is really warm.

603
00:34:30,770 --> 00:34:33,860
And then, you know, but
the thing is the next year,

604
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:38,060
the next year you change,
you adapt to the new temperature.

605
00:34:38,390 --> 00:34:42,680
And then I was cold in fifth, then
I'm wearing jackets. Yeah, it changes.

606
00:34:42,681 --> 00:34:43,730
It changes really fast.

607
00:34:43,970 --> 00:34:47,120
I walked into Starbucks the other day
and these ladies were complaining about

608
00:34:47,121 --> 00:34:49,370
the rain.
It's been raining so much lately.

609
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:53,040
Yeah. I'm like, you fucking crows. Yes.

610
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:58,260
Had Dumb crows were horrible drought.
They just make it noise.

611
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:03,310
And I'm like, why the why
now life giving water. Yes.

612
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:07,800
Nice in the sky. Ah, what is
it going to do with water?

613
00:35:07,801 --> 00:35:10,470
The crops? Yeah. Phoebe animals.

614
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:14,110
Yeah. We don't need it. You're right.
It was hilarious. Let's shut it down.

615
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:16,440
Just people will find something to
complain about. But it's just so,

616
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:17,830
it's adorable when you see it.

617
00:35:18,370 --> 00:35:20,830
This is like, this is,
ah, this is so cliche.

618
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:23,710
Like people are complaining
at a good thing.

619
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:26,260
I know it's been happening
quite often. Like, Eh,

620
00:35:26,261 --> 00:35:28,930
I wish I wasn't making so
much money like at all.

621
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:31,930
It's got all these accounts
with sweat off his sex,

622
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:37,290
feeling good and get my dick.
That's a real great complained to have.

623
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:38,190
People are weird,

624
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:40,350
man. They're weird. They'll
complain about everything.

625
00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:42,870
I think people just look
to complain about shit.

626
00:35:42,871 --> 00:35:45,030
So a lot of times they
don't have to look inward.

627
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:48,570
There's a lot of complaining and going
on. I was just like, that's externally,

628
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:52,110
you know, venting your internal
frustrations. That's most,

629
00:35:52,111 --> 00:35:55,500
I think that's most of the time. Sometimes
I catch myself doing it and that's it.

630
00:35:55,510 --> 00:35:58,620
Like it's funny. It's sometimes
it's funny to problem. Yeah,

631
00:35:58,770 --> 00:36:03,150
like sometimes like when Diaz complains
about Shit, Diaz complains it will be,

632
00:36:03,151 --> 00:36:07,110
hopefully would complain about dressing
different flavors of dressing and just

633
00:36:07,111 --> 00:36:10,890
start laughing. He, he, he's mocked
me for like everything I've ever done.

634
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:12,263
Tell me something.

635
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:15,360
What do you wish you got your fucking
fanny pack over there captain?

636
00:36:15,810 --> 00:36:17,640
There was always be something,
you know,

637
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:21,630
I remember when Eddie Bravo had
this fucking wrist bracelet on.

638
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:25,200
It was like one of those
leather bracelets, you know
those rock and roll type,

639
00:36:25,330 --> 00:36:28,320
the snap and a Joey walks up
was what are you waiting for?

640
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,780
A fucking Falcon Atlanta and your arm

641
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:34,230
Falcon.

642
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:39,090
He gave me shit just for talking to
people and because we were traveling

643
00:36:39,091 --> 00:36:43,140
together and like it was like the third
person that had come up and been like,

644
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:46,710
Hey, are you guys doing shows like
they, and he pulled me, he goes,

645
00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:51,030
well you stop fucking talking to
people. What did I do? He's like,

646
00:36:51,090 --> 00:36:54,090
I'm trying to get in the fucking car,
get to the hotel. I want to take a nap,

647
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:57,000
play with my balls, stop fucking talking
to people. I'm like, all right, all right.

648
00:36:57,001 --> 00:37:00,780
Sorry. But he was so fired up that
I was like, hey man, I'm like that.

649
00:37:00,781 --> 00:37:03,940
I responded to somebody who wanted to the,
it's hilarious.

650
00:37:03,941 --> 00:37:06,420
He gets in those moods if he doesn't eat,
it's ridiculous.

651
00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:08,250
Especially right when
we land at the airport,

652
00:37:08,251 --> 00:37:11,400
him and he has to get to his
hotel as soon as possible.

653
00:37:11,401 --> 00:37:14,700
Like Joe would just be punching in like
an an address in the GPS. He's like,

654
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,070
just drive cars, you know,
it's just, he gets mad.

655
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:22,150
He got mad at me for what I
ate too. Like, um, because,

656
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:24,300
because I didn't eat enough,

657
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:28,230
like I just happen to like that time
and we landed and it'd be healthy. Yeah.

658
00:37:28,231 --> 00:37:31,720
I ate a salad. He was like, what
the fuck are you fucking salad day?

659
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:33,750
He had like four plates dressing.

660
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:37,220
You gotta have a dressing
you fucking half a Mamo.

661
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:41,010
He's a fantastic, yeah,
he's quite a character man.

662
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:43,620
Getting mad at you for what you eat.
Yeah.

663
00:37:43,950 --> 00:37:47,240
So funny getting mad at
you for what you wear.

664
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:52,350
But that's different. It's like humorous.
That's humorous. No, just whining.

665
00:37:52,351 --> 00:37:55,530
It's just, yeah, sometimes. I mean
sometimes I complain and I'm like,

666
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:56,970
and you realize it's funny.

667
00:37:57,210 --> 00:38:00,090
Sometimes in the middle of
complaining I'll just be like, oh,

668
00:38:00,091 --> 00:38:02,400
I'm just complaining.
I'm complaining as a distraction.

669
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:06,990
I don't want to focus on something to
do with me. It's just, it's, it's weary,

670
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:10,410
weary, some. It's tiresome
when someone does it.

671
00:38:10,411 --> 00:38:14,280
It's like if someone's really
negative and not in that funny way,

672
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:18,170
but in like just the genuine, like
everything sucks. Everyone, you know,

673
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:21,480
everyone's out to get me that shit.
You can't be around.

674
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:24,570
It's not healthy to be around.
There's a lot of people like that.

675
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:28,230
They get stuck in that Rut. I had an
ex girlfriend like that. Oh my God.

676
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:32,400
It was brutal. It does. It's
like a disease. She would
complain about everything.

677
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:36,040
I mean everything from food to

678
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:40,900
the restaurant to the people sitting next
to the table to this, to that, to that.

679
00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:44,680
This is just like a skirt. I can't be
around there now. So just negativity.

680
00:38:45,130 --> 00:38:48,550
Whereas you could be around the
same person, the same situation,

681
00:38:48,551 --> 00:38:51,730
and they just notice all the cool
shit about things and you know,

682
00:38:51,731 --> 00:38:55,500
have a different balance perspective.
Give a little energy to the conversation.

683
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,480
Be Be someone that's,
you know,

684
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:00,910
sensitive to how other
people are perceiving you
and what kind of vibe you're

685
00:39:00,911 --> 00:39:04,030
giving off. Have you ever been
around the extreme opposite though,

686
00:39:04,031 --> 00:39:04,481
where it's like a,

687
00:39:04,481 --> 00:39:08,650
usually a girl that's just super positive
net can never see any negativity.

688
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:12,730
That shit's almost as an
annoying little delusional.

689
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:18,010
Delusional is not good.
Right, right. Delusional is
not good. There's delusional,

690
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:21,210
there's a lot. None of the things
about girls, about people. It's all,

691
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:25,780
it's like positive perspectives. Nice.
But yeah, not seeing the negative like,

692
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:26,771
well,
you know,

693
00:39:26,771 --> 00:39:31,100
I think what he's doing now is
just trying to establish himself.

694
00:39:31,101 --> 00:39:35,710
I know he's a crook. No, he's stealing
people's cars. Like, no, he's a con man.

695
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:40,120
Well, it's not as easy for him
probably as it was for you.

696
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,400
So maybe we should give him
the benefit of the doubt.

697
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:46,780
There's also a certain level of just
being naive. Really naive is better word.

698
00:39:46,810 --> 00:39:50,740
Yeah. Clueless. Naive, delusional.
The girl, the guy I know that does,

699
00:39:50,741 --> 00:39:55,230
that carries around crystals in our purse.
Do you,

700
00:39:55,270 --> 00:39:59,590
when you smell, but truly on a girl, do
you immediately go, oh Christ human being,

701
00:39:59,591 --> 00:40:03,580
period. Let, what's not hang out.

702
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:07,810
It doesn't about that bad.
It was exotic. It was exotic.

703
00:40:07,811 --> 00:40:08,770
It wouldn't smell that bad.

704
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,500
The real problem with Patrulla
is the people who were Patrulla.

705
00:40:11,890 --> 00:40:14,350
That's the real problem.
That's true. Because you know,

706
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:17,410
like there's smells you'll
associate with certain things.

707
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:20,790
Like there was a smell of citrus and they,
they,

708
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:25,750
they got these mice and what they did
was they zap these mice, his feet,

709
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:28,300
um,
and every time they'd zap their feet,

710
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:31,420
they would spray the
citrus smell in the air.

711
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:36,610
And so these mice would associate
the citrus smell with getting zapped.

712
00:40:37,210 --> 00:40:40,900
So I think when you smell,
but truly that shit just,

713
00:40:40,901 --> 00:40:43,920
you just think of knowing hippie.
Here we go. Yeah, that's true.

714
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:47,580
Here we first thought, here we
go. And knowing lazy person. Yeah,

715
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:49,870
you're just gonna go, you smelling,
you're like, you're a bad person.

716
00:40:49,871 --> 00:40:53,680
I don't like you. It's all share.
We knew basically like sheer crops.

717
00:40:53,681 --> 00:40:58,180
And how about the poetry and you can give
me some food. It's not so great smell.

718
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:02,020
Let's be honest. It smells. I
don't really like it. Honestly.

719
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:03,700
I couldn't even picture it right now.

720
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:08,350
It smells like black licorice
mixed with dirty feet.

721
00:41:08,650 --> 00:41:10,750
If it was a really pretty girl,
I probably wouldn't bother you.

722
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:14,200
If you're like really into her.
Did she put them on? It's not true.

723
00:41:14,290 --> 00:41:18,570
I think you'd be like, maybe you're
just picky. That smells nasty.

724
00:41:18,571 --> 00:41:22,070
That's like worse than be out. Do you
like that? Oh No, it's not. That's it.

725
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:26,460
A logical vios disgusting.
Especially bon a woman. Oh Christ.

726
00:41:26,530 --> 00:41:29,340
The problem I have when I'm fucking
guys, I don't mind a little bit. Oh,

727
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:32,400
you know what I'm saying,
girls, that's where it is.

728
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:37,700
It's such a violent smell though.
Like any, so no, no, no petroleum.

729
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:41,230
It's such a going to be, oh my boo
is way more violent than Patrulla.

730
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:44,030
It's like old lady and roses.
Perfume.

731
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:45,710
You know like they walk
by and you're almost like,

732
00:41:45,711 --> 00:41:49,340
I got a headache now from that smell. Well
that's strong, but truly I like a mile.

733
00:41:49,341 --> 00:41:54,260
But you'll hear there's be, oh that's,
that's right. I mean, you know,

734
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:57,170
everyone knows their own, but like you
ever get like in a cab and you're like,

735
00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:00,500
whoa man.

736
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:04,940
I remember I worked in the real estate
office in Boston like right after college

737
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,950
and there were these
guys could pay everyone.

738
00:42:06,951 --> 00:42:10,220
Boston has like just nothing but
apartments and nothing but red all day.

739
00:42:10,221 --> 00:42:14,240
Just tell you get a trapping.
But boy does, it has to.

740
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:17,030
Everyone has beo.
There were these three guys,

741
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:20,600
these guys would come in and when
they came in everyone was like, whoa.

742
00:42:20,601 --> 00:42:24,200
As they walked in the door, like
what the fuck? Oh, these three guys.

743
00:42:25,010 --> 00:42:28,850
As soon as they left, we would take the,
like the Febreeze. I was like for breeze,

744
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:32,900
deliberate though the new, but then what
happened was they would be, you know,

745
00:42:32,901 --> 00:42:34,370
they needed to check out apartments.

746
00:42:34,610 --> 00:42:38,690
So whoever lost the bet
in the office at the time,

747
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:40,850
we'd have to take them in their
car because they, you know,

748
00:42:40,851 --> 00:42:42,810
they're going to be in your car.
You have to get it detail.

749
00:42:43,030 --> 00:42:46,610
So people will be like, no fucking
way. No. Like you would, you would try,

750
00:42:46,670 --> 00:42:47,660
you do whatever you want.

751
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:52,460
You could to not get these dudes
or any guys like them in your car.

752
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:56,330
It's always thought it was always dude,
smell like that, fucking that strong.

753
00:42:56,420 --> 00:43:00,440
I had a kid in school, uh, and
when, when I lived in Florida,

754
00:43:00,441 --> 00:43:03,080
it was like the first
stinky kid that I remember.

755
00:43:04,130 --> 00:43:07,160
He turned out to be a real nice
kid. It was, he's a sad case.

756
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:11,930
He had been burned in a fire when he
was young. Jesus, yeah, not totally,

757
00:43:11,931 --> 00:43:15,650
but one of his ears was pretty fucked
up and he was like really insecure about

758
00:43:15,651 --> 00:43:17,120
it.
And um,

759
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:21,410
we actually got in some sort of a physical
altercation and I don't remember what

760
00:43:21,411 --> 00:43:22,244
the thing was,

761
00:43:22,820 --> 00:43:27,320
but I remember we had to go to
the teacher's office and um,

762
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:30,830
I remember it wasn't like super violent.
We didn't like beat each other up,

763
00:43:30,831 --> 00:43:33,200
like maybe like pull each other's
clothes or something like that.

764
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:38,100
Cause we were like 11. And, um, when
we went to the teacher's office or the,

765
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:41,140
you know, the principal's office, we
got to sit down and talk about it. The,

766
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:44,480
the principal asked us both what had
happened and neither one of us was really

767
00:43:44,481 --> 00:43:48,620
mad and, but when we decided to like
can you guys shake hands and be friends,

768
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:53,210
he was like so eager to shake hands
and be friends. I realized that like,

769
00:43:53,211 --> 00:43:54,800
Oh this poor fucking guy man,

770
00:43:54,801 --> 00:43:58,310
he smells bad and he's got a burnt ear
and he probably just didn't have any

771
00:43:58,311 --> 00:44:01,790
friends. Like the reason why
he was douchey was probably
just wanted some sort of

772
00:44:01,791 --> 00:44:04,840
attention.
Like I remember thinking that at the tide.

773
00:44:05,070 --> 00:44:08,060
Like his overwhelming,
like I told him,

774
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:09,620
I didn't think he was
going to sucker punch me.

775
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:12,200
I didn't think I was going to say, yeah,
let's be friends and they would, you know,

776
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:13,430
till we get outside pitch.

777
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:16,910
It wasn't any of that but it was like
he really wanted to be friends. Yeah.

778
00:44:16,911 --> 00:44:19,430
And so I remember we shook hands
and we like gave like a shake,

779
00:44:19,431 --> 00:44:22,280
shake hands hug thing and we were cool
with each other. From then on out,

780
00:44:22,281 --> 00:44:24,380
but that poor bastard stock.
Yeah.

781
00:44:24,770 --> 00:44:26,660
I don't know if his parents
didn't take care of them.

782
00:44:26,661 --> 00:44:28,380
If he was scared to bathe or if you know,

783
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:32,070
maybe it's amazing the way
smells a stick in your memory

784
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:33,460
forever.
They do.

785
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:36,840
Like you remember like how good
something smelled somewhere or something.

786
00:44:36,841 --> 00:44:38,640
You know, you smell it
again and you're like, oh,

787
00:44:38,641 --> 00:44:41,670
that takes me back to exactly this point.
You remember it.

788
00:44:41,671 --> 00:44:45,420
And then a s a smelly mother. Like I can
smell those dudes in Boston right now.

789
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:47,273
I want to get out of here.

790
00:44:47,310 --> 00:44:52,310
I want to leave where cats or pets
you stop smelling cats or boxes.

791
00:44:52,950 --> 00:44:56,760
I just put down my cat that I talked
about last time I was on the show and for

792
00:44:56,761 --> 00:45:00,920
my first time in 17 years, I get to
have a house that has no litter box. Oh.

793
00:45:01,010 --> 00:45:04,020
And I don't even know what that's like.
Well, you're lazy too. I don't think he,

794
00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:11,610
oh yeah. It's like, oh, once a week. Just
throw it in the letterbox. Oh my God.

795
00:45:11,611 --> 00:45:13,740
See that's the problem.
You have to do that every day.

796
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:16,940
Otherwise you're breathing shit. Did
you hire a maid paneling fumes? I,

797
00:45:16,950 --> 00:45:19,710
I've had a made, uh, right now I don't
have it. You've got to get it made.

798
00:45:19,790 --> 00:45:21,090
Watching one of those top was made.

799
00:45:21,091 --> 00:45:23,880
So they have one that you did that I tried
to, I told you that you did try that.

800
00:45:23,881 --> 00:45:26,880
Yeah. How'd it go? It's
not good. It's bad.

801
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:30,420
It was like an older man and his,
her daughter I think.

802
00:45:30,450 --> 00:45:34,650
And you can't choose who you get
to. Not Topless. Why? I don't know.

803
00:45:34,651 --> 00:45:36,720
There's like a few different
companies, but when I did, I just,

804
00:45:36,721 --> 00:45:39,970
there's a van parked down my street so
I just called it and I can just gawking

805
00:45:41,350 --> 00:45:44,010
like you rub maps, massage pose. Right.

806
00:45:44,060 --> 00:45:47,970
Why wouldn't you do at least do a
fine Yelp review? It said 99 bucks.

807
00:45:47,971 --> 00:45:51,240
I wasn't really thinking into it and
like I didn't think like, oh wait,

808
00:45:51,330 --> 00:45:53,330
I have to watch them clean because when,

809
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:56,320
when a maid's it and I'm like one of
the guys that hides cause I'm so ashamed

810
00:45:56,321 --> 00:45:59,290
I'm right. But then like you just kind
of stand there in the kitchen going up.

811
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:01,170
If she's topless, what, this is stupid,

812
00:46:01,171 --> 00:46:05,460
what am I doing this she really cleaning
or they do a bad job? No, they're,

813
00:46:05,461 --> 00:46:06,510
they're,
they're just doing,

814
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:10,050
they're just regular mates
that are getting an extra
20 bucks to take their top

815
00:46:10,051 --> 00:46:12,750
off I think because these are,
these are people that are like,

816
00:46:12,751 --> 00:46:15,840
they seem like they were related and
it seemed like just normal mates.

817
00:46:15,930 --> 00:46:20,040
It was very, very uncomfortable.
I kind of like it. I felt very bad

818
00:46:21,690 --> 00:46:23,160
because it was like sad.

819
00:46:23,190 --> 00:46:27,540
This was an older woman like oh
50 and maybe his or her daughter.

820
00:46:27,550 --> 00:46:32,280
That's maybe, are you sure
with her daughter? It seemed
like a mom and daughter.

821
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:35,970
It was really fucked up. Well, you know,

822
00:46:35,971 --> 00:46:38,940
you gotta think if you know someone that's
really fucked up and they have a kid,

823
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:41,100
that kid's going to grow
up with a fuckup parent.

824
00:46:41,310 --> 00:46:44,070
Like if someone's like
really crazy or you know,

825
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:46,430
if someone is a top was made for living,

826
00:46:46,450 --> 00:46:47,700
they don't think there's
anything wrong with it.

827
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:50,550
And then you know your daughter hits
18 she's like, mom, I want to join.

828
00:46:50,551 --> 00:46:53,400
The top was made business. You're
like, hey, it's good enough for me.

829
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:56,910
Why isn't it good enough for you?
The mom was a little over. Very true.

830
00:46:56,970 --> 00:46:58,320
Then mom was a little overweight,

831
00:46:58,321 --> 00:47:02,040
but she had a humongous Mexican
tits and when she took her bra off,

832
00:47:02,190 --> 00:47:07,190
it had the most horrific stretch marks
from our broad digging into her patients.

833
00:47:08,311 --> 00:47:12,210
Yeah, it was. It looks like, talk to
her like when she took her tits out. No,

834
00:47:12,211 --> 00:47:14,460
I just sat there and it both
just put it in a bucket.

835
00:47:14,461 --> 00:47:16,290
Like they just put their clothes.
They didn't,

836
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:20,490
we didn't list it like they didn't talk
or anything. They didn't say like, hello.

837
00:47:20,820 --> 00:47:24,660
They said hello when we came in,
but there were not any English or like,

838
00:47:25,170 --> 00:47:27,470
I was just like the kitchen living room.
I only had,

839
00:47:27,471 --> 00:47:29,130
hadn't cleaned the kitchen
living room in the bathroom.

840
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:33,220
I namely let them go and I shouldn't
say huge Mexican tits or something like

841
00:47:33,221 --> 00:47:37,850
that. They speak uncomfortable. They
speak English, right? Barely. They like,

842
00:47:38,190 --> 00:47:41,350
I remembered that they asked where the
vacuum cleaner was and it was very like

843
00:47:42,830 --> 00:47:45,400
clean, not have you looked
under your huge Mexican tits?

844
00:47:45,401 --> 00:47:48,250
I would always wonder like
what is that life like?

845
00:47:48,251 --> 00:47:49,510
I would have to ask them questions.

846
00:47:49,511 --> 00:47:52,450
I would give them extra money just
to be able to ask them questions.

847
00:47:52,780 --> 00:47:55,750
I'll say I'll pay you for a whole extra
hour if you sit down for another five

848
00:47:55,751 --> 00:47:58,450
minutes. Just let me, how was the,
how was the daughter attractive?

849
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:02,350
The daughter wasn't bad but she was a
little chubby or also like they were both

850
00:48:02,351 --> 00:48:06,130
a little chubby but the mom's
boobs were weird cause they had,

851
00:48:06,190 --> 00:48:10,330
she had like the huge like hanging ones
and she was cleaning the kitchen and I

852
00:48:10,331 --> 00:48:12,400
just, I would like just kind
of walk in and just be like,

853
00:48:12,430 --> 00:48:16,240
oh this is going on in here and it here.
Just dirty boobs. Like touching the oven.

854
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:20,290
Oh he's cleaning it. You
have minutes. I'm very sad.

855
00:48:20,340 --> 00:48:23,260
It's nothing exciting. It was
horrible. I do not recommend it.

856
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:26,140
I just would want to talk to them
and find out what that's like.

857
00:48:26,141 --> 00:48:30,340
Like the guys like try to attack you
like that seems like a dangerous kid.

858
00:48:30,730 --> 00:48:34,420
That's why they do it though cause there's
so they weren't very appealing and it

859
00:48:34,421 --> 00:48:37,960
was sad that I think it was like a
onetime thing. I would rather pay.

860
00:48:38,150 --> 00:48:39,280
It was a one time for them.

861
00:48:39,310 --> 00:48:42,610
I think once you get it you're not
going to have them come back ever again.

862
00:48:42,611 --> 00:48:46,520
You know what I mean? It's
like it's almost a joke. One
time thing for you. Yeah.

863
00:48:46,550 --> 00:48:50,830
Go one time thing for them. Would you
pick I would rather do for 20 extra bucks,

864
00:48:50,831 --> 00:48:51,611
get a regular made,

865
00:48:51,611 --> 00:48:55,150
but I could be bottomless and
they would not like get mad at me.

866
00:48:55,210 --> 00:48:58,110
Like I would just sit in there with
normal mates and just have no pants on it.

867
00:48:58,210 --> 00:48:59,043
That'd be better.
Right.

868
00:49:02,710 --> 00:49:06,730
I think that's illegal.
That's what I'm saying.

869
00:49:06,731 --> 00:49:08,980
The agreement is I don't
have to have where parents,

870
00:49:09,190 --> 00:49:11,430
well I'm sure someone can
do that. Brang sure. That's,

871
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:15,190
well you have to want to have
your pants off with them too.

872
00:49:15,191 --> 00:49:19,780
So they'd have to be like
at least somewhat attractive
lead to stroke and just

873
00:49:20,170 --> 00:49:21,040
follow them around,

874
00:49:21,070 --> 00:49:25,060
but they can't call it root cause then
you would get in the way and your little

875
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:29,470
narrow hallway and accidentally come
on them. I know I work in this city.

876
00:49:29,471 --> 00:49:34,190
You could definitely work. Work out
your fantasy. That's a minor request.

877
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:37,150
You could work out some pretty
crazy shit in this town. Definitely.

878
00:49:37,510 --> 00:49:41,020
Have you heard about this movie?
The Jinx, this, this show on Hbo?

879
00:49:41,110 --> 00:49:42,070
I'm all caught up,
man.

880
00:49:43,090 --> 00:49:45,670
Do you know the reopen that
guy's case because of that show?

881
00:49:46,510 --> 00:49:51,020
Um, I did not know everybody that doesn't
know what the show's all about. Well, it,

882
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:52,353
there's uh,

883
00:49:52,540 --> 00:49:57,540
a gentleman named Robert Durst
who is part of the Durst family,

884
00:49:57,940 --> 00:49:59,890
which is a,
he was an air,

885
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:04,810
the Durst family was one of the biggest
five biggest real estate families in New

886
00:50:04,810 --> 00:50:06,170
York.
And um,

887
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:11,270
he was sort of even growing up
kind of the outcast son, um,

888
00:50:11,530 --> 00:50:15,820
mother died, committed suicide or
fell, uh, when he was really young.

889
00:50:15,821 --> 00:50:19,270
And basically in, in the late
seventies, early eighties,

890
00:50:19,570 --> 00:50:23,770
his wife Kathleen disappeared,
um, and disappeared.

891
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:27,920
Nobody has, even up to this day,
no one's up with the finder.

892
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:30,590
He was never formally charged.

893
00:50:30,591 --> 00:50:34,910
People thought he had something
to do with it and I'm no trace.

894
00:50:34,911 --> 00:50:37,580
He gave a lot of different
accounts to the police,

895
00:50:37,581 --> 00:50:40,940
to investigators of what happened the
last time you saw her the last time we

896
00:50:40,941 --> 00:50:41,774
spoke to her.

897
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:44,990
So all of these kinds of things that
don't match up that mark make you make it

898
00:50:45,140 --> 00:50:49,250
sound pretty suspicious.
Um, so when the case wasn't,

899
00:50:49,430 --> 00:50:52,370
it didn't progress anymore.
A few years later,

900
00:50:52,430 --> 00:50:57,430
his best friend at the time was a woman
named Susan Berman and she was set to

901
00:50:58,790 --> 00:51:03,680
talk to investigators when they
reopened the case this time in the,

902
00:51:03,681 --> 00:51:08,330
I would say, I think we're talking like
into the nineties now. Um, so it, it,

903
00:51:08,340 --> 00:51:09,830
it had a lot of time had passed and they,

904
00:51:09,831 --> 00:51:14,150
investigators wanted to talk to Susan
Berman who had been Durst best friend in

905
00:51:14,151 --> 00:51:19,151
whom there was a a long line of track
record of him giving her money over the

906
00:51:19,730 --> 00:51:23,540
years. And you know, from his account it's
like, it's a, it's a good friend of mine.

907
00:51:23,570 --> 00:51:27,470
I just always gave her money. But she
collected a substantial money from him.

908
00:51:27,860 --> 00:51:28,131
Well,

909
00:51:28,131 --> 00:51:33,020
the day before an investigator was
flying out from New York to see her,

910
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:35,570
she was murdered in her
house in Benedict Canyon.

911
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:41,440
So it was like kind of the second person
involved or close to Robert Durst who

912
00:51:42,770 --> 00:51:46,490
died. How much money did he give her?
Well, there was, they found that like,

913
00:51:46,491 --> 00:51:50,810
you know, like in, in one
of her, one of her journals,

914
00:51:50,811 --> 00:51:53,210
she kept tracked of like loans or gifts.

915
00:51:53,211 --> 00:51:57,230
People had given her money and
recently he had given her 50 grand,

916
00:51:57,860 --> 00:52:01,640
you know, so, and the way
that they piece it together,

917
00:52:01,641 --> 00:52:06,380
they think that over the years she's
collected much more than that. So it was,

918
00:52:06,590 --> 00:52:08,000
she's, um, you know,

919
00:52:08,030 --> 00:52:11,840
was his friend who was always kind of
struggling and he was always giving her

920
00:52:11,841 --> 00:52:16,610
money. So, you know, from his, from
his side of the story, I'm rich,

921
00:52:16,940 --> 00:52:21,110
I give my friend money, um, from people
that are more suspicious of it, it's,

922
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:25,160
here's money to never open
your fucking mouth. Wow. Um,

923
00:52:25,370 --> 00:52:29,780
so he allegedly gets her whacked that
that's one of the things now hurt.

924
00:52:29,810 --> 00:52:34,810
She has a pretty interesting story because
her father was a big time mafia guy.

925
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:39,180
Her Dad was real close with
Bugsy Siegel and was in,

926
00:52:39,410 --> 00:52:43,100
in the heyday of Vegas being run with the,
by the mob.

927
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:45,710
Her Dad was one of the major players.

928
00:52:46,130 --> 00:52:49,130
So people who say it's not Durst related,

929
00:52:49,131 --> 00:52:53,510
we'll say that it's related to a book
she wrote where she kind of laid out a

930
00:52:53,511 --> 00:52:56,420
bunch of stuff about the mob and like
her dad's role in things and all these

931
00:52:56,421 --> 00:53:00,650
people. So they say, you know,
oh, it's, it's, it's very
much in line with a mob hit.

932
00:53:01,310 --> 00:53:03,620
So that there's that.

933
00:53:03,650 --> 00:53:08,630
And then a few years after
that, um, well right when,

934
00:53:08,780 --> 00:53:09,620
you know, they, they,

935
00:53:09,730 --> 00:53:13,550
that they knew that we were going
to reopen this investigation. Um,

936
00:53:13,580 --> 00:53:17,900
he wanted to go into hiding.
So he moved to Galveston,

937
00:53:17,901 --> 00:53:21,380
Texas and he just started
living as a mute woman.

938
00:53:22,070 --> 00:53:26,910
So he wore a wig and he wore a dress
and he started renting an apartment in

939
00:53:26,911 --> 00:53:30,780
cash. He paid like a year up front and
he knew he couldn't mask his voice,

940
00:53:30,781 --> 00:53:33,870
so he pretended to be a mute woman,
so he would only write down things.

941
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:38,250
And he eventually developed a friendship
with the guy across the hallway from

942
00:53:38,251 --> 00:53:42,630
him named Morris Black, who was
just like this old curmudgeonly guy.

943
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:46,950
And basically fast forward,

944
00:53:47,850 --> 00:53:51,420
um,
in the Galveston Bay of fishermen fines,

945
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:56,040
a floating bag and it
has an arm and a leg.

946
00:53:56,250 --> 00:53:56,820
And then the,

947
00:53:56,820 --> 00:54:01,820
basically the police come and they find
chopped up body and they find an ID and

948
00:54:02,311 --> 00:54:04,410
they're able to get fingerprints
and it's more, it's black.

949
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:08,910
So it's the guy that was across the hall.

950
00:54:08,911 --> 00:54:13,911
So they go to his apartment and they
see across the hall is this woman who's

951
00:54:14,071 --> 00:54:17,970
living there, who's not there at
the time. And uh, you know, they,

952
00:54:18,180 --> 00:54:23,010
they find that like the, there's,
there's blood on the floor, just kind of,

953
00:54:23,490 --> 00:54:27,030
you know, all the telltales of
that. Like something happened here.

954
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:30,870
And what ends up ended up happening
was that he was charged with murder.

955
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:35,550
He posted bail and then he
went on the run. Um, and, uh,

956
00:54:36,090 --> 00:54:40,430
he actually got caught
shoplifting a sandwich. Um,

957
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:44,850
when he was after he had jumped bail and,
uh,

958
00:54:45,060 --> 00:54:49,710
in his car they found 38,000 in cash
flow and he had 500 in his pocket.

959
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:52,770
Like he just shoplifted
for the, for the, you know,

960
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:53,970
they didn't want to pay for the sandwich.

961
00:54:54,450 --> 00:54:56,550
That's how he got caught
after he jumped bail,

962
00:54:57,930 --> 00:55:02,250
then he gets charged with murder.
He doesn't deny murdering.

963
00:55:02,251 --> 00:55:06,270
The guy says it was self defense,
but he also chop the guy's body up,

964
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:11,190
like cut off his arms, cut off his legs,
cut off his head, put them in bags,

965
00:55:11,250 --> 00:55:15,330
threw them in the bay. Oh, not guilty.

966
00:55:15,870 --> 00:55:20,070
Jury decides not guilty. So, uh, you know,

967
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:23,160
so he admits to killing a person.
Yeah.

968
00:55:23,220 --> 00:55:27,840
Chopping them up and not
guilty. And you know, there's,

969
00:55:27,890 --> 00:55:32,400
there's a lot of people that like, that
swear that he, you know, or three people.

970
00:55:32,430 --> 00:55:36,000
Let's go three people. Yeah. So it
makes sense. If he's killed one,

971
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:39,600
they caught him red handed, killing
one and cutting up the body. Yeah,

972
00:55:39,601 --> 00:55:43,740
that's deep shit. That's something
you do on your third body bodies.

973
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:48,510
You light on fire this case. Are
they going there? They've read it.

974
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:50,280
That's the thing in this
country, there's, you know,

975
00:55:50,281 --> 00:55:55,110
there's no statute of
limitations on murder. So you,
um, you know, I think this,

976
00:55:55,111 --> 00:55:59,260
the show went into so much
detail about, uh, so he's also,

977
00:55:59,261 --> 00:56:02,550
Susan Berman was 2001
a nutty motherfucker.

978
00:56:02,730 --> 00:56:06,660
He notes the craziest part and just
in the, in the interviews on the show,

979
00:56:06,661 --> 00:56:10,920
on the jinx, his eyes look black.
They looked like a dirty man.

980
00:56:10,950 --> 00:56:15,720
They look like demon arts specifically
the entire time he's being interviewed.

981
00:56:15,721 --> 00:56:18,450
And like you look and they
cut back to the, the guy who,

982
00:56:18,570 --> 00:56:21,210
because they made a movie
about the Galveston story. Uh,

983
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:23,830
I think Ryan Gosling started.
He's like, it's pretty good movie.

984
00:56:24,190 --> 00:56:28,960
That guy who directed that film made this
documentary and they're in this hotel

985
00:56:28,961 --> 00:56:31,920
and the back and forth. Every time
they cut to his eyes are like this.

986
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:36,640
It looks like a fucking, like a, what's
it called? Like from like drag me to hell.

987
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:40,150
It's like slither in the Harry Potter,
like snake got,

988
00:56:40,151 --> 00:56:44,260
you're like Jesus Christ as their
no. Eichler. Hey, it's pitch black.

989
00:56:44,290 --> 00:56:48,770
What's The a Ryan Gosling
movie? Um, I don't know. I
don't remember the name. It's,

990
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:51,120
it's a good movie that
kind of, you know, in a,

991
00:56:51,750 --> 00:56:54,910
that takes you through
the story pretty well.

992
00:56:54,910 --> 00:56:57,610
And actually Durst liked the film so much.

993
00:56:57,970 --> 00:57:00,730
That's why he agreed to do this
series with this guy. All good things.

994
00:57:00,731 --> 00:57:04,990
All good things. Oh my God. Yeah. He
liked it so much that he agreed to do.

995
00:57:05,050 --> 00:57:07,630
And then that movie does,
he chopped the guy up.

996
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:12,640
I can't remember if he does it in
the, in the Gosling movie, but um,

997
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:17,290
yeah, it has Gosling Gosling
playing him. Wow. But, um,

998
00:57:18,670 --> 00:57:21,100
I think he probably would because,
you know, he really did that.

999
00:57:21,101 --> 00:57:25,450
He had missed it doing that.
What the fuck my, yeah. Yeah.
He's, he's, uh, he's in, uh,

1000
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:28,780
there's a, there's a detective on
the jinx that says it best. He goes,

1001
00:57:28,781 --> 00:57:31,260
I don't think that Robert Durst,
uh,

1002
00:57:31,340 --> 00:57:33,790
is like somebody who
takes pleasure in killing.

1003
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:36,550
I don't think he's like
a bloodthirsty guy,

1004
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:39,640
but I think if you corner him and you,

1005
00:57:39,850 --> 00:57:44,200
you make them feel threatened about
something, he'll kill you. And I was like,

1006
00:57:44,201 --> 00:57:49,120
I think there's probably accurate. It's
also, when you think about this guy,

1007
00:57:49,390 --> 00:57:52,540
he's, how old is he now?
Like 70 older. He's gotta be,

1008
00:57:52,541 --> 00:57:55,870
he's gotta be late seventies late
seventies early eighties yeah, I think so.

1009
00:57:55,900 --> 00:58:00,550
Think about this guy he grew up in,

1010
00:58:00,820 --> 00:58:03,990
you know, what does that mean? He was
born in the forties yeah, he's here.

1011
00:58:04,030 --> 00:58:08,820
He has to be, you have his age,
it's gotta be, so let's, uh,

1012
00:58:08,890 --> 00:58:13,720
let's just say, let's just say the forties
yeah. So he's born in 43? Yeah. Okay.

1013
00:58:13,930 --> 00:58:17,530
There you go. So he's born in the
forties so he grows up, you know,

1014
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:21,730
when he's seven, it's 1950. You can
basically do anything back then. True.

1015
00:58:21,820 --> 00:58:24,760
There was no fucking fingerprints.
There's no DNA. And if you're rich,

1016
00:58:25,390 --> 00:58:28,390
when did they figure out finger breath?
Find that out.

1017
00:58:28,710 --> 00:58:32,560
One finger is to solve crimes.
I'm guessing the turn of the century,

1018
00:58:32,590 --> 00:58:35,530
I'm guessing 19 hundreds. I
might be wrong about nine, 1940.

1019
00:58:35,531 --> 00:58:39,580
I say 1876 for fingerprints either way.

1020
00:58:39,670 --> 00:58:43,570
1892 1,802 but Bam. Um, either way, uh,

1021
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:49,080
I think that those people that grew up
then they had like a different sense of

1022
00:58:49,421 --> 00:58:54,000
like what you'd get away with. I
think so too. That and money. Yeah.

1023
00:58:54,120 --> 00:58:57,820
Oh yeah. Because of money. Money,
especially if you're talking to, I mean,

1024
00:58:57,821 --> 00:58:59,350
we've been,
everybody says now you know,

1025
00:58:59,351 --> 00:59:03,190
somebody with money can do what they
want, get it. Wait, but back in the day,

1026
00:59:03,380 --> 00:59:05,350
that's what that is truly reality.

1027
00:59:05,810 --> 00:59:09,100
If you come from a lot of money
and you destroy something,

1028
00:59:09,101 --> 00:59:12,370
if you ruin somebody's, you kill
somebody. They're like, well, you know,

1029
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:15,760
you have a lot of money, so yeah, we're
going to, we're going to pay for shit.

1030
00:59:15,790 --> 00:59:18,820
Peanut lumped them shekels.
Yeah. And when he was doing this,

1031
00:59:19,540 --> 00:59:22,310
like when he was living in Galveston,
Galveston, he had that apartment.

1032
00:59:22,310 --> 00:59:26,660
He was still rich. Right. Rich as fuck.
Just, you know, showing the money.

1033
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:30,320
Uh, he could still access money.
I mean, when he got arrested,

1034
00:59:30,860 --> 00:59:33,380
he called his wife who,

1035
00:59:33,410 --> 00:59:37,130
cause he's married now and
remarried someone who was
living in New York and they,

1036
00:59:37,131 --> 00:59:41,690
you know, this is Galveston, Texas, and
they're like, bail is set at 250 grand,

1037
00:59:42,050 --> 00:59:46,860
which is, you know, you, that's what you
got to pay. And he's like, cool. He calls,

1038
00:59:46,900 --> 00:59:47,151
he's like,

1039
00:59:47,151 --> 00:59:51,980
you need a 250,000 and then living in
an apartment because he wanted to be off

1040
00:59:51,981 --> 00:59:53,900
the grid.
He wanted to be,

1041
00:59:54,590 --> 00:59:58,360
he wanted nobody to notice
him because he knew the,

1042
00:59:58,580 --> 01:00:01,460
that investigation had just
fired up again. Which you know,

1043
01:00:01,660 --> 01:00:05,660
is not normally how innocent people
act. Yeah. Especially living as a woman,

1044
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:09,830
mute woman in Texas. Yeah. Why don't
you just go to another country?

1045
01:00:10,220 --> 01:00:11,920
That's a good question.
Yeah.

1046
01:00:11,921 --> 01:00:15,320
I know he still had access to some
money because paid that in full.

1047
01:00:15,321 --> 01:00:19,220
That's two 50 gone when he
jumped bail. And then, uh,

1048
01:00:19,221 --> 01:00:23,390
he hired a team of lawyers, like
they were like, this is the best,

1049
01:00:23,660 --> 01:00:27,350
this is the best defense lawyer
in Texas criminal defense lawyer.

1050
01:00:27,530 --> 01:00:30,530
And so is this guy. And he
was like, cool. Both. Whoa.

1051
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:35,210
Hate them each 600 grand to defend
him on this case and they got him off.

1052
01:00:35,250 --> 01:00:38,480
They got him off Jesus.
I wonder what the what,

1053
01:00:38,540 --> 01:00:42,020
what could they have said that makes it
okay to chop somebody up and throw them

1054
01:00:42,021 --> 01:00:45,800
in the ocean. You know about it takes
up a lot of space in your house.

1055
01:00:47,630 --> 01:00:52,490
Ladies and gentlemen, this is a mute
woman we're talking about. Okay. This man,

1056
01:00:52,491 --> 01:00:54,980
he didn't know my client
could defend himself.

1057
01:00:55,190 --> 01:00:58,010
He thought he was attacking a mute woman.
Imagine if that was your Mama.

1058
01:00:58,550 --> 01:01:02,570
Imagine it was your grandmom and this
bloodthirsty fucking savage of Jewish

1059
01:01:02,571 --> 01:01:05,460
descent.
I say some shit like that.

1060
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:11,680
Tries to fuck your grandma. Your mute
grandma can't even cry out for help. Any,

1061
01:01:11,710 --> 01:01:13,790
any. All him jury Jewish. Yeah.

1062
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:17,930
I didn't think sending y'all on the jury
have a grandma that you love dearly and

1063
01:01:17,931 --> 01:01:22,700
you don't want some hooligan. Fucking
her and some strange Galveston apartment.

1064
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:27,030
If you ain't a Jew,
you must acquit cheap.

1065
01:01:31,340 --> 01:01:34,520
Yeah, it's pretty intense. I wonder
what, what would the argument be like?

1066
01:01:34,521 --> 01:01:37,080
How could they, they got to say the
guy was trying to kill them. Yeah,

1067
01:01:37,100 --> 01:01:41,400
they show it. Um, I'm trying to remember.
Uh, they showed him the documentary. Yeah.

1068
01:01:41,401 --> 01:01:45,050
Yeah. Oh, there's a lot of footage from
the trial. Wow. Yeah. I need to hear it.

1069
01:01:45,051 --> 01:01:48,770
I need to hear what like what the hell
could episode four has all that stuff.

1070
01:01:49,010 --> 01:01:50,600
It's great.
It's when they read not guilty,

1071
01:01:51,020 --> 01:01:53,450
they have the camera on him and he's
like, keeps turning. He's like, no,

1072
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:57,260
they said not guilty and he's
like, you sure? And they're
like, yeah, yeah, not good.

1073
01:01:57,280 --> 01:02:00,470
He's like, Gosh, thank God.
It must feel amazing. Yeah.

1074
01:02:00,471 --> 01:02:03,840
That's kind of like you're about to go to
jail after he chopped it dude up. Like,

1075
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:06,950
like, what are the odds?
How can I get off this?

1076
01:02:06,951 --> 01:02:09,830
How great would it be if they say
not guilty? He goes, that's three.

1077
01:02:12,020 --> 01:02:15,020
He walks out and fucking gang signs
of the camera's on the way out.

1078
01:02:15,530 --> 01:02:19,980
Have you seen the a shook night footage?
No, I haven't. I wanted to see it, but I

1079
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:22,320
was on a plane yesterday.
Yes. We'll show it.

1080
01:02:22,350 --> 01:02:25,770
We can't show it on the air because
it's very, very, very disturbing.

1081
01:02:26,010 --> 01:02:27,120
If you want to see it yourself,

1082
01:02:27,121 --> 01:02:31,140
they have footage of shook night running
over those guys. And it's an accident,

1083
01:02:31,141 --> 01:02:34,350
right? No, just she, you need to see it.

1084
01:02:34,560 --> 01:02:37,770
There's no accident involved in this.
This is not an accident.

1085
01:02:39,210 --> 01:02:40,990
Is there a live leak
version or did you sit down?

1086
01:02:41,010 --> 01:02:45,660
Billy got captured on Security Cam.
No. Yeah. So here's shook night.

1087
01:02:45,661 --> 01:02:49,020
He pulls up. Yeah. Apparently
they were filming the, the um,

1088
01:02:49,080 --> 01:02:53,430
there's bone Nwa film.
Yeah. So this dude shows up,

1089
01:02:53,640 --> 01:02:56,490
but it looks like there's some
kind of something going on here.

1090
01:02:56,550 --> 01:03:00,780
And the guy had a gun. Look, I'm sure
some people were threatening him.

1091
01:03:01,050 --> 01:03:02,430
I'm sure there was some shit going on.

1092
01:03:02,670 --> 01:03:07,020
But note what actually happens like this,

1093
01:03:07,170 --> 01:03:11,370
this part is not a God damn accident.
Look at that. Bam. And then watch us.

1094
01:03:14,510 --> 01:03:19,340
This is hard. This is hard to
watch. Oh. Oh, oh, that guy is dead.

1095
01:03:20,360 --> 01:03:24,610
The first guy lived, the second guy.
The first guy lived. Yeah. Yeah.

1096
01:03:24,620 --> 01:03:27,620
That's why they blurt out the second guy,
the spots,

1097
01:03:28,040 --> 01:03:33,000
because that guy just
got murdered. Wow. Yeah.

1098
01:03:33,001 --> 01:03:35,750
Like he's moving them around.
That's good. And then this guy,

1099
01:03:35,751 --> 01:03:40,190
he's a gospel possible gun and
sticks it in his back. Yeah.

1100
01:03:40,191 --> 01:03:42,320
Most likely it wasn't gun.
Yeah.

1101
01:03:43,790 --> 01:03:47,030
He might've pulled a gun out on Shugg
night and chug night drove over him.

1102
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:50,710
I mean, that's what it looks like to
me. I mean, look, somebody ran it.

1103
01:03:50,711 --> 01:03:55,340
I ran out to him. Hey you, you son
of a gun. It was like some movement,

1104
01:03:55,341 --> 01:03:56,320
like he was a great,
yes,

1105
01:03:56,330 --> 01:04:00,230
the other truck moves or the grabbing
each other or something. Fucking name.

1106
01:04:00,231 --> 01:04:01,910
That's unbelievably hard to watch.

1107
01:04:02,090 --> 01:04:05,630
So you think sugar definitely did it
to murder. Not just like freak out,

1108
01:04:05,631 --> 01:04:08,720
like get me the fuck out of here and he's
just gone. Well it could be that too,

1109
01:04:08,721 --> 01:04:12,620
but look at this, watch this, Bam. And
he didn't try to go around that dude.

1110
01:04:13,070 --> 01:04:17,150
He went over him and ran that
guy over. Yeah, that's true.

1111
01:04:17,290 --> 01:04:21,590
That guy was getting run over,
which is what most of us would do.

1112
01:04:21,591 --> 01:04:25,660
Some pointed a gun at us.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Did you see
what TMZ released today? Uh,

1113
01:04:25,730 --> 01:04:27,590
footage from like four years ago.

1114
01:04:27,591 --> 01:04:32,510
When he was with Kat Williams and he did
the exact same thing where he just went

1115
01:04:32,511 --> 01:04:36,320
through a crowd of people in his
SUV. Uh, I, they just put it on,

1116
01:04:36,321 --> 01:04:40,620
it's on the front page of TMZ today.
They did, he hurt anybody through,

1117
01:04:40,940 --> 01:04:44,340
let me check it cause I didn't even look
actually watching the video. Just solid.

1118
01:04:44,440 --> 01:04:48,920
They did a documentary on him.
The guys guy's been through a lot of shit.

1119
01:04:49,040 --> 01:04:52,130
That's it.
She's just got shot earlier this year too.

1120
01:04:52,131 --> 01:04:55,850
I mean it's like a real live
gangster. Yeah. Living amongst us.

1121
01:04:55,851 --> 01:04:58,540
Bad Shit happens though.
Wherever he is. Oh yeah. Yeah.

1122
01:04:58,550 --> 01:05:00,800
You don't want to be around every
time he's at the comedy store. I,

1123
01:05:00,801 --> 01:05:05,420
I legit gets scared like I, I'm, I'm, he,
cause he used to come there a lot. He's,

1124
01:05:05,421 --> 01:05:08,690
he attracts, you know, that guy has a,

1125
01:05:08,700 --> 01:05:13,700
has a legacy of wrong doing
and just bad people around.

1126
01:05:14,330 --> 01:05:16,880
Like if you're in a room with him
that something bad's going to happen.

1127
01:05:16,940 --> 01:05:20,080
I kind of amazing that he, up until
this point was still out in the street,

1128
01:05:20,140 --> 01:05:24,610
you know? Yeah. And he's served, you
know, significant time before. Like he's,

1129
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:26,590
yeah,
well this is the last thing.

1130
01:05:26,591 --> 01:05:30,460
When he got shot apparently really
fucked him up pretty bad. It just,

1131
01:05:30,461 --> 01:05:34,420
he just struck, striked one person
last time you went to Iraq and uh,

1132
01:05:35,350 --> 01:05:39,310
and he doesn't say anything about if the
person died or anything. Jesus Christ.

1133
01:05:39,800 --> 01:05:42,460
Yeah, Dude. Yeah. It's weird.

1134
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:45,760
It's weird when you find out about those
guys that are still out there and you

1135
01:05:45,761 --> 01:05:49,600
go really in 2015, this really obvious
bad guys still running around out there.

1136
01:05:49,630 --> 01:05:51,710
Yeah. He's like a villain, right?
He's like a movie villain. Look,

1137
01:05:51,711 --> 01:05:53,920
imagine if John Gotti was
alive and out there running,

1138
01:05:54,010 --> 01:05:57,640
running around in little Italy mocking
people the way he did back before they

1139
01:05:57,641 --> 01:06:01,420
arrested him. It, it's pretty crazy. That
was a weird one. That's like a movie.

1140
01:06:01,840 --> 01:06:06,190
Well the John Gotti one was a lot like
a movie because here was a guy and the

1141
01:06:06,191 --> 01:06:08,180
celebrate the parades and
the streets from this,

1142
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:10,540
from the neighborhood your works
and all that kind of crazy shit.

1143
01:06:10,540 --> 01:06:13,510
And everybody loved the neighborhood
because it was, everybody was safe.

1144
01:06:13,900 --> 01:06:16,270
You know why this guy was the dawn?
Yeah.

1145
01:06:16,300 --> 01:06:19,750
He would walk around and he's like super
expensive suits and laugh and always

1146
01:06:19,751 --> 01:06:23,260
look confident as hell. Big, thick fucking
neck. Let trying to fuck with me. Yeah.

1147
01:06:23,290 --> 01:06:26,620
It was all like, like they're just bugging
the guy for no reason. That was my,

1148
01:06:27,080 --> 01:06:29,650
it's favorite quote of mine is that,
uh,

1149
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:33,550
like after it was all said and done and
he said all I ever wanted was a good

1150
01:06:33,551 --> 01:06:36,970
sandwich. That was, that's what he
said. That's what this is all about.

1151
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:40,340
This could have been resolved so much
easier if we just went to a deli. Hey,

1152
01:06:40,390 --> 01:06:44,500
just give me a sandwich
sandwich. Salami. Well,

1153
01:06:44,501 --> 01:06:49,440
Putin is kind of that guy, but way bigger,
way bigger scale. He's, yeah. You know,

1154
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:53,860
and he's kind of that guy in Russia.
Yeah. I mean, he just killed his fucking,

1155
01:06:53,861 --> 01:06:56,380
an adversary or somebody
killed his adversary,

1156
01:06:56,870 --> 01:07:01,340
some guy who was the leader of the
whatever other party over for us and that,

1157
01:07:01,341 --> 01:07:03,320
you know, like there's net, you know,

1158
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:08,410
they arrested people and one of the guys
blew himself up. Blew himself up. Yeah.

1159
01:07:08,411 --> 01:07:10,150
They got to the guy's apartment,
he blew himself up.

1160
01:07:10,210 --> 01:07:15,210
And there's never going to be a real
investigation in this and in Russia today

1161
01:07:15,610 --> 01:07:19,390
of like the, you know, you
know, it's connected to him.
Like the order came down.

1162
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:21,400
You think so I don't think
they'll put it together. No,

1163
01:07:22,060 --> 01:07:23,200
not cause they're not capable.

1164
01:07:23,260 --> 01:07:26,330
It's just that more people would
have ended up getting shot.

1165
01:07:26,540 --> 01:07:31,360
You definitely think it was
Putin's ideally kill that.
It's his idea. You're not,

1166
01:07:31,390 --> 01:07:33,700
there's not going to be a recording
of him saying it, but you know,

1167
01:07:33,701 --> 01:07:37,840
his camp is like, yeah, for
sure. I'm reserving judgment,

1168
01:07:37,841 --> 01:07:40,670
but it certainly looks that way.
What's really fascinating to me, uh,

1169
01:07:41,020 --> 01:07:45,310
one of the things that's
really fascinating to me is
that this is only one thing

1170
01:07:45,400 --> 01:07:47,470
that they do. That's insane. Yeah.

1171
01:07:47,500 --> 01:07:49,960
But there's other things they
do that's insane with super,

1172
01:07:49,990 --> 01:07:53,620
super rich people where they
accused him of a crime. They go in,

1173
01:07:53,621 --> 01:07:54,580
they take their businesses,

1174
01:07:54,581 --> 01:07:56,980
they take all their money and they
put them in jail and they did this,

1175
01:07:56,981 --> 01:07:59,590
this really rich,
wealthy Russian oligarch,

1176
01:07:59,591 --> 01:08:02,680
and they had him in jail for a long time.
Man. And they recently released him.

1177
01:08:02,681 --> 01:08:05,770
I think he was in jail for like more than
eight years, if I remember correctly.

1178
01:08:06,190 --> 01:08:08,530
But I remember the story getting out.
I'm like,

1179
01:08:08,531 --> 01:08:10,870
this is the most insane story
I've ever heard in my life.

1180
01:08:11,080 --> 01:08:14,770
This guy was some wealthy
oil guy was worth, you know,

1181
01:08:14,780 --> 01:08:19,100
billions us dollars and they just
came in and took this guy's business,

1182
01:08:19,460 --> 01:08:23,030
put him in jail. And that's what
they've done it several times.

1183
01:08:23,060 --> 01:08:27,380
It's not a onetime thing they do. They
just go in there, whatever the dispute is,

1184
01:08:27,381 --> 01:08:31,250
they just decide that you an enemy of
the state or your, uh, you know, you,

1185
01:08:31,260 --> 01:08:34,250
your trees in whatever
crime they doctor up,

1186
01:08:34,550 --> 01:08:36,710
slap your ass in jail,

1187
01:08:36,740 --> 01:08:40,130
take all of your money and they just
leave you in jail for a long time.

1188
01:08:40,160 --> 01:08:42,770
It's horrific. It's insane.
Yeah. And I imagine too,

1189
01:08:42,771 --> 01:08:44,990
like if you're just a regular citizen,
like you can't,

1190
01:08:45,530 --> 01:08:49,910
how scary that is to live there.
And you think like, well, you know,

1191
01:08:49,911 --> 01:08:52,430
start talking about it. Like, make
us think about it. And it's like, no,

1192
01:08:52,431 --> 01:08:56,840
you really don't like,
then you also get thrown in jail or worse.

1193
01:08:57,290 --> 01:09:01,040
You can't, you can't even speak up about
it. You know, we don't, we don't really,

1194
01:09:02,180 --> 01:09:03,470
we don't comprehend that,

1195
01:09:03,830 --> 01:09:07,200
that feeling that it must be to
completely live in fear. Yes.

1196
01:09:07,820 --> 01:09:10,460
And it's not that the,
this, this, without a doubt.

1197
01:09:10,490 --> 01:09:12,920
There's some organizations in
this country, they don't even,

1198
01:09:12,921 --> 01:09:16,430
you don't have to name them that have
done horrific shit too to US citizens.

1199
01:09:16,460 --> 01:09:19,730
They've done, people have been murdered.
Things have happened for sure. Right.

1200
01:09:19,900 --> 01:09:24,500
We all agree that, but it's nowhere near
the scale of it is right now in Russia.

1201
01:09:24,501 --> 01:09:26,780
Like whatever corruption you
might think there is an American.

1202
01:09:26,781 --> 01:09:28,340
I would agree with you.
There's a lot of corruption,

1203
01:09:28,730 --> 01:09:32,700
but nothing compared to what's going on
in Russia. No, Russia is nuts, man. Yeah.

1204
01:09:33,080 --> 01:09:36,830
That reminds me of like, I mean I, I had
a lot of Cuban friends when I lived in,

1205
01:09:37,340 --> 01:09:42,170
in south Florida. Like all their
stories of their parents were like that,

1206
01:09:42,260 --> 01:09:45,860
that like, you know,
yeah, Castro just there.

1207
01:09:45,861 --> 01:09:49,160
Like we had this successful whatever,
these stores,

1208
01:09:49,250 --> 01:09:53,930
and he just took our stores,
took our shit, and I was like,

1209
01:09:53,931 --> 01:09:57,590
it's not yours anymore.
Yeah. What the fuck? Well,

1210
01:09:57,591 --> 01:10:02,000
that's what happens when you've got a guy
who was essentially like a king. Yeah.

1211
01:10:02,030 --> 01:10:04,890
I mean, he's an emperor. I mean,
he's like an emperor Russia. Yeah.

1212
01:10:04,900 --> 01:10:08,090
That's really what he's like,
right? Yeah. Yeah. It's terrifying.

1213
01:10:08,660 --> 01:10:09,950
What does that guy's life like?

1214
01:10:10,280 --> 01:10:13,700
What do you think of reality
show following Putin around
for a day would be like,

1215
01:10:14,150 --> 01:10:14,840
imagine if he,

1216
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:19,840
if he just decided to allow cameras to
follow him around for a year and just

1217
01:10:21,171 --> 01:10:25,100
show how he actually runs shit. If
he gets so crazy and he's like, look,

1218
01:10:25,610 --> 01:10:28,490
I'll just show you all of it. You
want to see what we do? Oh yeah,

1219
01:10:28,491 --> 01:10:31,160
this guy is talking a lot of shit
about me, so we're going to kill him.

1220
01:10:32,450 --> 01:10:35,030
And then they sent some guys out and
they'd gun some dude down and everybody

1221
01:10:35,031 --> 01:10:39,050
goes, okay, who's going to, who's going to
do something about this? Nobody. Nobody.

1222
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:40,760
We're going to do something
about that. It's like, what the,

1223
01:10:40,790 --> 01:10:45,290
what would the United States do?
We thoroughly, what did they say?

1224
01:10:46,190 --> 01:10:50,960
They say we thoroughly disagree with Mr
Putin's decision to murder his biggest

1225
01:10:50,961 --> 01:10:53,100
critic literate. We say, yeah, it would,

1226
01:10:53,101 --> 01:10:55,340
it would be the complete
of bullshit statement.

1227
01:10:55,520 --> 01:10:58,850
Of course they didn't do anything of
course that, and if we did do something,

1228
01:10:58,851 --> 01:11:01,320
then they would start talking shit about
what, well, what about your drones?

1229
01:11:01,420 --> 01:11:05,650
What happened today was a
terrible tragedy. And we, uh,

1230
01:11:06,590 --> 01:11:10,400
we respect anyone's right to express
themselves and say what they say and

1231
01:11:10,401 --> 01:11:13,040
critique whomever they want to critique.
The,

1232
01:11:13,410 --> 01:11:16,470
the solution is not dumping
their body in rivers. Thank you.

1233
01:11:16,650 --> 01:11:20,910
Bring them up fat and then
dumping the body in rivers.
Yeah. It's, it's insane, man.

1234
01:11:20,970 --> 01:11:24,240
I think a lot of his actions too, or
it's all based in fear too, you know?

1235
01:11:24,510 --> 01:11:26,670
But like tough guy things.
People think they're like,

1236
01:11:26,760 --> 01:11:30,240
that guy's just this violent,
crazy guy and they're all just scared.

1237
01:11:30,950 --> 01:11:35,820
More scared. The Russian
version. KGB. KGB. Yeah. Yeah.

1238
01:11:36,060 --> 01:11:38,790
And he's, he's still looking
pretty good at 62 years old.

1239
01:11:38,940 --> 01:11:42,540
He looks like the guy that you would think
of when you think of like a dangerous

1240
01:11:42,570 --> 01:11:46,560
leader of a foreign country like Russia,
dangerous like hawk,

1241
01:11:46,561 --> 01:11:50,490
like and know military
shirtless on horseback. Yeah.

1242
01:11:50,520 --> 01:11:52,880
That's the way to fucking roll.
Well that was one of the things that,

1243
01:11:53,330 --> 01:11:58,090
what the fuck is his name? Um, uh,

1244
01:11:58,091 --> 01:12:01,690
the dude from the Bourne identity,
handsome bastard, Matt Damon, Matt Damon.

1245
01:12:02,170 --> 01:12:04,390
Matt Damon had said about Sarah Palin.

1246
01:12:04,420 --> 01:12:08,800
It was hilarious when he was talking
about, it's like Sarah Pailin and uh, her,

1247
01:12:08,820 --> 01:12:12,490
you know, Witty charm, you
know, getting to a folksy charm.

1248
01:12:12,491 --> 01:12:17,491
I think the term you use getting to become
vice president with a guy is old as,

1249
01:12:18,020 --> 01:12:20,410
uh, what the fuck is
his name? John Mccain.

1250
01:12:20,650 --> 01:12:22,990
John Mccain was like in
his seventies already,

1251
01:12:23,060 --> 01:12:25,120
right when he's running for
president or at least close to it.

1252
01:12:25,480 --> 01:12:30,340
Like if he dies and then
she could possibly be across
the table from Putin. Yeah.

1253
01:12:30,430 --> 01:12:34,420
They were talking about sailor Sarah
Pailin and Putin sitting down. Well, Vlad,

1254
01:12:34,421 --> 01:12:38,800
I gotta tell Ya I what you're doing.
Oh, America is just wrong in America.

1255
01:12:38,801 --> 01:12:41,500
She's not going to stand for it.
I'll tell you right now,

1256
01:12:41,620 --> 01:12:46,180
the land of free home of the brave, he
would probably just her right there on TV,

1257
01:12:46,720 --> 01:12:50,770
just punch her in the face and everybody
scattered down the road goes back for

1258
01:12:50,771 --> 01:12:54,910
her. Oh my God. It could be world war
three. Yeah. I liked that. Their culture,

1259
01:12:54,911 --> 01:12:58,840
like he never smiles, you know, that's
considered like goofy and week. Yeah.

1260
01:12:58,900 --> 01:13:02,560
Just smile at the eastern bloc. Well
he never gives you like a, yeah, no,

1261
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:06,410
not like Obama.
Obama like has a wide open laughing smile.

1262
01:13:06,411 --> 01:13:10,150
Like he's a jolly fellow. Yeah. Yeah,
for sure. Yeah. That's considered goofy.

1263
01:13:10,270 --> 01:13:11,950
I wonder what they think about America.

1264
01:13:12,070 --> 01:13:16,000
I wonder what like the KGB type fellows
that are running Russia right now,

1265
01:13:16,720 --> 01:13:19,420
silly week.
Um,

1266
01:13:20,590 --> 01:13:24,190
guys smiled too much. Yeah,
but do you wonder like,

1267
01:13:25,320 --> 01:13:25,880
okay,

1268
01:13:25,880 --> 01:13:28,370
I wonder what they think about
the way their government works?

1269
01:13:28,520 --> 01:13:29,440
I wonder if there's,
like,

1270
01:13:29,480 --> 01:13:32,750
is there a select group of people
that all this money's getting evenly

1271
01:13:32,751 --> 01:13:36,190
distributed too so that everybody like
keeps her mouth shut or how many people

1272
01:13:36,191 --> 01:13:38,750
are wanting to kill that guy and we're
going to have to deal with the guy who

1273
01:13:38,751 --> 01:13:43,670
kills him someday. You know, there's
people that are all in for sure.

1274
01:13:43,850 --> 01:13:48,650
And I think there's a lot of people that
are just begging for things to change.

1275
01:13:48,651 --> 01:13:53,030
Did you see the HBO documentary recently
on um, uh, gay people in Russia?

1276
01:13:53,240 --> 01:13:58,220
No, that was a tremendous, there's really
a documentary how like, they're, you know,

1277
01:13:58,221 --> 01:14:03,221
they've written laws recently like it and
like there's these groups of guys that

1278
01:14:04,671 --> 01:14:09,260
are just out hunting gays and they
like to, they like to bait them.

1279
01:14:09,620 --> 01:14:12,070
So they put like ads and

1280
01:14:12,070 --> 01:14:15,400
a guy poses like a,
I want to meet you.

1281
01:14:15,850 --> 01:14:18,010
And then when the guy shows up,

1282
01:14:18,460 --> 01:14:21,730
there's like 15 people and they hold
them down and they like throw it piss on

1283
01:14:21,731 --> 01:14:26,350
him and they, they, uh, put them
on camera and make him like,

1284
01:14:26,351 --> 01:14:28,060
just mock them. It's, it's terrible.

1285
01:14:28,061 --> 01:14:31,450
And then they upload it and everybody
watches it in the country. So,

1286
01:14:31,480 --> 01:14:34,420
and a lot of times it's that guy
who they're mocking would be,

1287
01:14:34,450 --> 01:14:39,370
would be a guy in the closet and like,
we'll lose his job. Family. Well,

1288
01:14:39,371 --> 01:14:42,250
they just humiliate them. It's,
it's, it's brutal. It was brutal.

1289
01:14:42,490 --> 01:14:45,370
What do you think that is?
Like what is this all of a sudden,

1290
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:48,310
especially what does this
new attention on gay people?

1291
01:14:48,580 --> 01:14:53,580
I think it's because there's been a
lot of progress with gay gay rights and

1292
01:14:53,740 --> 01:14:55,810
especially in the last 10 years.

1293
01:14:56,140 --> 01:15:00,370
So when something like that's coming
more to the forefront, you go like, dude,

1294
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:02,700
this can't, you know, the
people that don't want it, the,

1295
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:06,370
the super homophobic people are going
to act the way that they're acting.

1296
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:11,400
There's so scared that this is going
to be the norm and that we're going to

1297
01:15:11,621 --> 01:15:16,250
treat them like human beings maybe
even hear that. They're like, no. Like,

1298
01:15:16,270 --> 01:15:20,860
so they, you know, they started
these organizations like, uh, better,

1299
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:23,410
better family today group.
You know,

1300
01:15:23,411 --> 01:15:28,180
it's like we can't let these people
be teachers and, and you know,

1301
01:15:28,240 --> 01:15:31,510
just live in our apartment buildings.
They're, they're pariahs. Yeah. So they,

1302
01:15:31,511 --> 01:15:35,260
you know, they associates all the old
shit like all gay people are pedophiles,

1303
01:15:35,261 --> 01:15:40,120
like all that shit. So, but that is
like thriving and huge in Russia.

1304
01:15:40,150 --> 01:15:43,270
Not just thriving, but they're, they're
making laws against it. Yeah, man.

1305
01:15:43,300 --> 01:15:47,260
They're making laws act like imagine
if someone tried to actively make laws

1306
01:15:47,500 --> 01:15:49,210
against gay people today
in the United States,

1307
01:15:49,211 --> 01:15:51,550
there would be a huge uproar
throughout the country.

1308
01:15:51,850 --> 01:15:53,260
What kind of uproars or in Russia?

1309
01:15:53,830 --> 01:15:57,070
I think it's one of those things
where it's like, it's very,

1310
01:15:57,580 --> 01:16:00,160
it's really rare to speak up against that.

1311
01:16:00,190 --> 01:16:05,190
I think more people are probably in
fear of saying something then doing what

1312
01:16:05,831 --> 01:16:10,390
they know is the right thing to do. You
know? That's the thing too is like you, I,

1313
01:16:10,440 --> 01:16:15,340
you have to empathize a lot with the
person who you know is in that situation

1314
01:16:15,341 --> 01:16:19,660
who's not siding with that but lives
in that kind of culture or you're like,

1315
01:16:19,661 --> 01:16:20,740
are you going to speak up?

1316
01:16:21,370 --> 01:16:25,920
Like when you know what the
response is going to be, you,

1317
01:16:25,921 --> 01:16:28,450
you want to say yes and you want
to be like, yeah, of course.

1318
01:16:28,451 --> 01:16:31,030
But it's a scary thing in a,
in a,

1319
01:16:31,650 --> 01:16:34,660
in an environment like that
to speak up and be like, no,

1320
01:16:35,170 --> 01:16:36,010
I'm going to say something.

1321
01:16:36,250 --> 01:16:39,250
Wasn't that Pussy Pussy riot
went to jail for as well?

1322
01:16:39,280 --> 01:16:42,010
I think one of the things that went
to jail for was protesting against the

1323
01:16:42,011 --> 01:16:44,590
treatment of gays and
Russia. I think so, yeah.

1324
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:46,060
That's one of the things where she was,

1325
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:50,170
or they were inside of a church like
there. Yeah. They did it on a church,

1326
01:16:50,410 --> 01:16:52,630
but one of the things they did
there were inside a church. Yeah.

1327
01:16:52,990 --> 01:16:55,390
There was another one they did.
They got beaten by belts.

1328
01:16:55,420 --> 01:16:59,200
Did you ever see that one? Oh,
there's footage of that. Fine.

1329
01:16:59,740 --> 01:17:02,760
These soldiers show up security people,
whatever they were, and they're, they're,

1330
01:17:02,761 --> 01:17:05,570
they're like literally beating
these girls with belts with like,

1331
01:17:05,680 --> 01:17:09,860
like a whip thing, dude. Yeah.
He just beat the fuck out of him.

1332
01:17:10,340 --> 01:17:13,430
Yeah. Me and it was when they were
protesting or I'll pull it up.

1333
01:17:13,670 --> 01:17:16,560
Pussy riot protests.
They were in,

1334
01:17:16,570 --> 01:17:19,800
the couple of them were in the new
season of house of cards. Really? Yeah.

1335
01:17:19,810 --> 01:17:24,340
They have a scene with the guy who's
basically playing Putin on the show. Yeah,

1336
01:17:24,410 --> 01:17:26,900
it's pretty, it's pretty, yeah.
That show's phenomenal. Yeah.

1337
01:17:26,901 --> 01:17:29,150
I need to wash that place
or watch that show rather.

1338
01:17:29,151 --> 01:17:32,150
I still haven't really have to start over
and touched it from the beginning and

1339
01:17:32,160 --> 01:17:35,900
it's one thing for sure. I had to give
up on homeland last night. No good.

1340
01:17:36,230 --> 01:17:39,230
The new season is the beginning
of it was just balling me out.

1341
01:17:40,010 --> 01:17:42,920
This chick is a thing about house of
cards is you got to give it a few,

1342
01:17:43,370 --> 01:17:47,330
but once you get started,
like it's your rope,

1343
01:17:47,331 --> 01:17:51,800
then yeah. This is when they get
beaten. What? Yeah, look there.

1344
01:17:51,801 --> 01:17:56,600
They put on their math. They just
masks I guess, and they do this thing.

1345
01:17:57,010 --> 01:18:00,290
Know like they're, they're dancing and
they'd come over and they get maced.

1346
01:18:01,040 --> 01:18:04,950
See the cops come over and may sum and
then they'd beat the shit out of him.

1347
01:18:05,360 --> 01:18:09,440
Look at this. These belt
things. Oh, whipping them. Shit.

1348
01:18:10,910 --> 01:18:14,060
They just start fucking them up.
He just put his weapon at camera,

1349
01:18:14,061 --> 01:18:16,130
man to everybody and everybody.

1350
01:18:16,131 --> 01:18:18,980
This is because they're
kicking everybody's ass and
they're doing it like while

1351
01:18:18,981 --> 01:18:22,100
they're being filmed. They
don't give a fuck. You know,

1352
01:18:22,101 --> 01:18:24,590
you imagine if this was happening in
America, like kicking him and shit.

1353
01:18:24,591 --> 01:18:27,530
They kicked her when she's down,
man, this is a security people there.

1354
01:18:27,770 --> 01:18:28,603
This is like,

1355
01:18:28,670 --> 01:18:33,590
they're not even hiding the
fact that this is their thugs.

1356
01:18:33,690 --> 01:18:35,420
Yeah.
This is like total thug shit.

1357
01:18:35,421 --> 01:18:37,310
They're kicking people in
their dow whipping them.

1358
01:18:37,610 --> 01:18:41,210
It's not like security guards in
America where policing in America,

1359
01:18:41,211 --> 01:18:44,690
if they did shit like that, they would
get reprimanded. They would like, Hey,

1360
01:18:44,691 --> 01:18:49,370
your violence is inappropriate violence.
But if they sprayed them with the,

1361
01:18:49,390 --> 01:18:52,130
they're allowed to spray him.
You hit him with a tear gas in the face.

1362
01:18:52,280 --> 01:18:54,980
You can do a few things
as far as restrain them.

1363
01:18:55,310 --> 01:18:58,760
You can't kick them and whip him like
that. It's pretty intense, man. I've seen,

1364
01:18:58,820 --> 01:19:01,030
I saw footage older like,

1365
01:19:01,040 --> 01:19:06,020
but like still modern day or like
rushing cops do not fuck around. Like,

1366
01:19:06,021 --> 01:19:10,730
and I mean like not for even just
like this, like standard crime stuff.

1367
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:15,020
Like, if you're actually going after
a guy who's whatever, you know,

1368
01:19:15,050 --> 01:19:17,360
selling drugs or something
that they would normally send,

1369
01:19:17,570 --> 01:19:22,190
like these cops would like jump over a
picnic table and kick a guy in the jaw.

1370
01:19:22,510 --> 01:19:26,570
Like to bring him down. Like they don't
fuck around. I saw footage of one,

1371
01:19:27,060 --> 01:19:29,090
a guy pulled over,

1372
01:19:29,120 --> 01:19:33,200
he was pulled over by the cops and the
cop like knocked on the window and the

1373
01:19:33,201 --> 01:19:35,470
guy got gestured and then he took a baton.

1374
01:19:35,500 --> 01:19:38,750
Just smashed the whole window open
while the guy at the car. Yeah.

1375
01:19:39,110 --> 01:19:42,830
I don't think in Moscow. You
fucking, you talked back to cops.

1376
01:19:42,920 --> 01:19:45,920
I don't think that it happens at
all there. It's, it's, it's uh,

1377
01:19:46,330 --> 01:19:50,480
it's not playing around.
Meanwhile, they live on the
same planet as us, right? Yeah.

1378
01:19:50,510 --> 01:19:54,260
They've been around longer than
us. Way longer than us. I mean,

1379
01:19:54,710 --> 01:19:59,390
what the fuck is going on in Russia?
I Dunno. That's a war torn place.

1380
01:19:59,560 --> 01:20:02,170
A lot of shit going on. Right. All this
crime. Do you know what's going on?

1381
01:20:02,190 --> 01:20:06,800
The Crimea stuff. Do you understand
that? Uh, I mean, I remember that. Um,

1382
01:20:06,890 --> 01:20:08,070
I mean,
I don't want to give

1383
01:20:08,070 --> 01:20:09,480
a bad account of it,

1384
01:20:09,481 --> 01:20:13,860
but like this was territory that Russia,
you know,

1385
01:20:14,070 --> 01:20:18,570
claimed a long time ago or what was
theirs and then they just straight up snag

1386
01:20:18,571 --> 01:20:22,220
that shit back from what does
the Ukraine right. And um,

1387
01:20:22,680 --> 01:20:26,940
huge dispute over it obviously. But
Pew Putin and Russia is like, no,

1388
01:20:27,250 --> 01:20:29,310
see that's where it's fucked
up to the Soviet Union.

1389
01:20:29,311 --> 01:20:32,400
They all used to be in the same girl
together. Yeah. They saw me together.

1390
01:20:32,540 --> 01:20:34,890
We're all one team and now they're
like going to war with each other.

1391
01:20:35,040 --> 01:20:38,080
That's like, if like we got rid of
taxes, we were like, you know what,

1392
01:20:38,081 --> 01:20:41,940
you guys can just beat her
own thing. Yeah. Oh, but we
want the Rio grandee. Yeah.

1393
01:20:42,010 --> 01:20:46,140
Get get. Yeah, that's ours. Give us, give
us that shit back. Wouldn't take it back.

1394
01:20:46,200 --> 01:20:50,050
Yeah. It's Texas back. We should
change our mind unchecked. I mean,

1395
01:20:50,130 --> 01:20:53,850
I think Putin would do and he would start
taking all kinds of places back. Yeah.

1396
01:20:53,910 --> 01:20:58,190
Do you think you would go to war? Would
he go to war with the United States now?

1397
01:20:58,540 --> 01:21:02,610
There's, I think even the
craziest person, you know,

1398
01:21:04,170 --> 01:21:07,950
you always have the nuclear threat and
the back of your mind and do you want all

1399
01:21:07,951 --> 01:21:12,250
out war? I Dunno. In this day and age
it's kind of hard to imagine, you know,

1400
01:21:12,360 --> 01:21:15,630
but the QMAP if it was,
if he was just like we're going to take,

1401
01:21:16,170 --> 01:21:18,510
I don't know if I can,
we're going to Russia.

1402
01:21:19,070 --> 01:21:21,480
If Russia is going to be like
we're going into Chechnya,

1403
01:21:21,481 --> 01:21:22,560
I'm going to fuck them up again.

1404
01:21:22,561 --> 01:21:25,710
Like they all like they have and take
the Republic of Georgia and all that shit

1405
01:21:25,720 --> 01:21:29,850
back. They say we've got a bad deal with
Alaska. We want that shit. Yeah. That was,

1406
01:21:29,851 --> 01:21:31,130
that's when it gets crazy.

1407
01:21:31,410 --> 01:21:33,780
If they find out how much oil is
in Alaska and they just decide,

1408
01:21:33,930 --> 01:21:38,930
I mean there's some shit
going on Antarctica like
claimings spots of land for

1409
01:21:39,151 --> 01:21:41,730
auto about that. I mean that
it's Russia really short. Yeah.

1410
01:21:42,060 --> 01:21:43,770
Cause it started down all that,
you know,

1411
01:21:43,860 --> 01:21:47,580
the snow caps are starting to melt and
so there's areas that are going to be

1412
01:21:47,581 --> 01:21:51,210
open to travel with boats that weren't,
that aren't, aren't open right now.

1413
01:21:51,211 --> 01:21:55,320
So they're starting to claim these
areas just because it's like old school,

1414
01:21:55,560 --> 01:21:58,950
you know, colonial type shit.
More war is inevitable, you know,

1415
01:21:58,951 --> 01:22:01,410
it's going to happen. You know what
I mean? What do you mean inevitable?

1416
01:22:01,411 --> 01:22:05,430
It's going on right now. But I mean
like even like whatever declines now,

1417
01:22:05,431 --> 01:22:08,790
it's not like that would be the end
of wars. It's just going to, yeah,

1418
01:22:08,820 --> 01:22:11,480
it's an endless cycle. It's
just seems like it is. Yeah.

1419
01:22:11,670 --> 01:22:15,750
This current design of human being
that we're, we're using. Yeah.

1420
01:22:15,810 --> 01:22:20,370
And the fact that, you know, we're
results in pro, like the money's made.

1421
01:22:20,371 --> 01:22:22,950
That's why it so much money involved in,
yeah.

1422
01:22:23,300 --> 01:22:27,360
You see these con like just the companies,
you know,

1423
01:22:27,361 --> 01:22:31,650
that that make money
does like designing a,

1424
01:22:31,860 --> 01:22:35,970
a ship or a rocket that the US
government likes. They're like,

1425
01:22:36,300 --> 01:22:40,250
this is great. We love this plane.
Billions. Billions of dollars.

1426
01:22:40,920 --> 01:22:44,400
Billions to you. Yeah. Make more awesome
shit. Make it go around the world.

1427
01:22:44,401 --> 01:22:48,420
And one second. Can you do that gun that
does what? Yeah. Yeah. You see that thing?

1428
01:22:48,421 --> 01:22:52,230
They have a laser, the shooting.
They can disable a car. No.

1429
01:22:52,231 --> 01:22:55,560
You know the shooting lasers through
the hood of a truck and just fucking

1430
01:22:55,561 --> 01:22:57,840
barbecues the engine.
Really? Oh, it's nuts.

1431
01:22:58,140 --> 01:23:01,590
Like it melts through the hood of a car.
I mean, I don't know how far it lasts.

1432
01:23:01,710 --> 01:23:04,800
How would the distance they're using
these things, but they aim did it.

1433
01:23:04,801 --> 01:23:08,140
They a test demonstration of it
and shot through an engine block.

1434
01:23:08,410 --> 01:23:12,140
You got that day. Look at this shit. Wow.

1435
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:18,310
Fired from a mile of Lockheed Martin THC.
It's from a mile away.

1436
01:23:18,500 --> 01:23:20,050
Do you see the boat one where they,

1437
01:23:20,150 --> 01:23:24,400
it's to get off of pirates and stuff and
they shoot it a boat and it catches the

1438
01:23:24,401 --> 01:23:26,510
boat on fire when it's going to shore up.

1439
01:23:26,600 --> 01:23:30,580
Imagine what Lockheed is going to get
for that. Like when they go, well,

1440
01:23:30,581 --> 01:23:34,450
you say what it does. Yeah. They can
shoot through an engine block a mile away.

1441
01:23:34,540 --> 01:23:39,430
It's this insane. Love your laser.
He was $19 billion fucking Amen.

1442
01:23:40,210 --> 01:23:42,610
How weird is that?
It's incredible.

1443
01:23:42,670 --> 01:23:47,260
Highest power ever documented by
a laser weapon and it's tight.

1444
01:23:48,040 --> 01:23:52,390
New York Stock Exchange Info. First
you guys know by. Isn't that funny?

1445
01:23:53,050 --> 01:23:55,510
Isn't that funny? Yeah. That's what it is.

1446
01:23:55,540 --> 01:24:00,540
Lockheed marketing and y s
e four you know Colin Lmt?

1447
01:24:00,820 --> 01:24:05,620
Yeah. It shows you that's
the first fucking thing. It
shows you. That's amazing.

1448
01:24:05,860 --> 01:24:10,740
That's amazing. I don't want to buy some
laser style is Lockheed martin.com so,

1449
01:24:11,350 --> 01:24:13,760
right.
But that's a press release from the,

1450
01:24:13,810 --> 01:24:16,540
the one when they did the
boat and the boat. Yeah.

1451
01:24:16,541 --> 01:24:19,130
They can do some crazy shit now and
they're going to set those things up in

1452
01:24:19,131 --> 01:24:23,800
space. So they're just be in
space. Star Wars floating above us.

1453
01:24:23,830 --> 01:24:26,200
They're just laser beam your
fucking house into the ground.

1454
01:24:27,670 --> 01:24:32,250
Unbelievable drones now and with
laser beams and the future, and

1455
01:24:33,910 --> 01:24:35,020
I just kind of wonder,

1456
01:24:35,220 --> 01:24:37,570
you got to wonder if we're going to
be able to keep it together. Yeah.

1457
01:24:37,990 --> 01:24:38,823
It's kind of amazing.

1458
01:24:38,830 --> 01:24:42,160
No one's dropped a nuke since the forties
I think it's amazing that all the time

1459
01:24:42,460 --> 01:24:47,460
and then and that entire
administration's goals,

1460
01:24:47,950 --> 01:24:49,710
like the entire thing that they're,

1461
01:24:49,950 --> 01:24:54,950
their number one goal a lot of times
is just to keep other governments from

1462
01:24:56,111 --> 01:24:58,840
getting one.
That's the number one list.

1463
01:24:59,110 --> 01:25:02,890
Number one on the list for
dozens of governments is like,

1464
01:25:02,920 --> 01:25:07,660
just keep Iran from developing one. Just
keep that from happening. But meanwhile,

1465
01:25:07,661 --> 01:25:10,870
Pakistan ASM. Yeah. India.
India has them. Yeah.

1466
01:25:11,110 --> 01:25:14,950
I mean they behaviors
coordinate each other and their
neighbors. Yeah. That point.

1467
01:25:14,951 --> 01:25:19,360
Nukes at each other. It's
terrifying. It smells better. Whoa.

1468
01:25:22,060 --> 01:25:26,290
Pakistan really? And why is that? India
is more famous for their food. Right?

1469
01:25:27,190 --> 01:25:30,320
Indian food is way more
popular. Yeah. Curry like, and,

1470
01:25:30,460 --> 01:25:34,840
but I think that I have a similar
Pakistani friend who said the food is very

1471
01:25:34,841 --> 01:25:38,290
similar. Yeah. It's a trick
question is it stinks like shit.

1472
01:25:38,320 --> 01:25:41,410
How dare you don't even go over there.
You don't even know this.

1473
01:25:41,830 --> 01:25:44,030
You're talking shit.
You know the,

1474
01:25:44,040 --> 01:25:48,040
yesterday I sat next to Serena
Williams on my flight. Yeah.

1475
01:25:48,041 --> 01:25:51,940
I saw that on your Instagram. I keep
meeting awesome black people on planes,

1476
01:25:51,970 --> 01:25:55,690
like it's out of control.
What other awesome black
people that you met on planes?

1477
01:25:55,870 --> 01:25:59,590
Bruce, Bruce, uh, Mike Tyson. Wow.

1478
01:25:59,591 --> 01:26:03,480
That's where you met Mike Tyson went
playing Serena the number one my title

1479
01:26:03,500 --> 01:26:05,450
became your buddy, right?
Well, yeah. I mean,

1480
01:26:05,510 --> 01:26:07,790
do you text each other every
now and again? No, not really.

1481
01:26:07,791 --> 01:26:11,120
I shouldn't text is way. No, I
don't. I'm still thinking about him.

1482
01:26:11,240 --> 01:26:15,320
I tell him he's my thoughts. Oh,
you and my thoughts and prayers.

1483
01:26:15,350 --> 01:26:19,010
But uh,
but so cool dude.

1484
01:26:19,011 --> 01:26:23,450
The coolest and that's arguably,
you know, one of the most dominant,

1485
01:26:23,480 --> 01:26:27,830
if not most dominant female athlete of
this generation. One of them for sure.

1486
01:26:28,040 --> 01:26:32,690
She's the best. She the number one, number
one. Who's number two? Any white chicks?

1487
01:26:33,080 --> 01:26:35,960
Oh yeah. Mix. There's a
bunch of the Europeans,

1488
01:26:36,630 --> 01:26:40,280
it's all Europeans where he skis and,
and, and Europeans are always in there.

1489
01:26:41,300 --> 01:26:42,980
That's interesting. He's so dominant, man.

1490
01:26:42,981 --> 01:26:47,390
How many American female tennis players
are there that are really famous? Well,

1491
01:26:47,391 --> 01:26:50,600
if we're talking about over the course
of history, there's been right now,

1492
01:26:50,690 --> 01:26:54,270
right now I really, I really wouldn't
know. I don't know. Right. So,

1493
01:26:54,380 --> 01:26:57,840
but this is one of my point was,
but Serena Williams is famous as food,

1494
01:26:58,220 --> 01:27:02,910
but she's famous as fuck because
she's such a winner. Right.

1495
01:27:02,990 --> 01:27:07,430
Like she is dominant and she and you
know a lot of female tennis players,

1496
01:27:07,930 --> 01:27:12,830
you know, they're declined hat like
they, they peak early age wise,

1497
01:27:12,950 --> 01:27:13,461
you know the,

1498
01:27:13,461 --> 01:27:18,350
the female dominance in tennis sometimes
happens teens and early twenties and

1499
01:27:18,590 --> 01:27:23,150
she's 33 number one in the world still
and still winning titles. You know,

1500
01:27:23,151 --> 01:27:26,000
she ran from a drug test. No. Yeah,

1501
01:27:26,001 --> 01:27:30,830
she hit herself cause either her, her
sister Venus. Yeah. When we find out,

1502
01:27:31,250 --> 01:27:33,920
um, they, she ran to her a safe room.

1503
01:27:34,040 --> 01:27:36,610
She said she thought someone was breaking
into the house and it was a truck.

1504
01:27:36,730 --> 01:27:41,330
That's what you
want me to find out what it was?

1505
01:27:42,100 --> 01:27:47,060
Yeah, it was Serena. Yeah,
it was her. That's hilarious.

1506
01:27:47,330 --> 01:27:49,770
I, you know, I think
it's one of those things,

1507
01:27:49,771 --> 01:27:54,350
swearing Williams locks herself in panic
room and drug test mix up. Woopsies wow.

1508
01:27:54,500 --> 01:27:56,900
I thought you were a murderer or
are you just a lab technician?

1509
01:27:58,700 --> 01:28:03,410
That's hilarious. She probably knew
she had like another six hours, four,

1510
01:28:03,411 --> 01:28:07,100
she piss clean. She got in there
and started drinking vinegar water.

1511
01:28:08,300 --> 01:28:12,650
That's Hilarious, man. Hiding the safe
room. Yeah. Yeah. That is hilarious.

1512
01:28:13,510 --> 01:28:17,610
That's just an impressive athlete,
man. She's an impressive athlete.

1513
01:28:17,660 --> 01:28:19,310
I think it's one of those sports,

1514
01:28:19,340 --> 01:28:22,580
much like track and field that
virtually everybody is doing something.

1515
01:28:23,340 --> 01:28:26,390
They didn't tennis. I didn't know about
it in tennis. Really? I really didn't.

1516
01:28:26,810 --> 01:28:29,740
I think every competitive sports,
it's worth millions of dollars. Yeah.

1517
01:28:29,840 --> 01:28:31,340
I think there's so much money on the line.

1518
01:28:31,370 --> 01:28:33,860
I think that's what they start looking at
it. They start looking at it like, look,

1519
01:28:34,100 --> 01:28:35,180
we have two options here.

1520
01:28:35,420 --> 01:28:40,160
Either we do it and we test positive
and we get fined or something goes wrong

1521
01:28:40,161 --> 01:28:44,780
and we get shamed or we do it smart and
nobody ever finds out and you make more

1522
01:28:44,781 --> 01:28:48,290
money. Yeah. Did you watch, did you
watch that Armstrong documentary?

1523
01:28:48,710 --> 01:28:52,940
The one on the one on Netflix?
I remember being on this show,

1524
01:28:53,440 --> 01:28:58,340
uh, a few years ago
before, you know, he got,

1525
01:28:58,370 --> 01:29:02,040
he admitted and all that stuff
and talking badly about him and

1526
01:29:02,040 --> 01:29:05,940
being like [inaudible] getting a lot
of messages from people that hated you,

1527
01:29:06,060 --> 01:29:08,790
that were really there. Like he's
never failed a test. You fucking idiot.

1528
01:29:08,850 --> 01:29:10,260
And they don't email me anymore.

1529
01:29:10,440 --> 01:29:12,990
That's what they always say too when you
ask them if they've ever done anything,

1530
01:29:13,020 --> 01:29:16,450
they go, I've never failed a test.
That was his big thing. Yeah. Yeah.

1531
01:29:16,590 --> 01:29:19,380
Everybody says that. They always say
that I've never failed a test. Yeah.

1532
01:29:20,190 --> 01:29:21,570
That's not what I asked you.
Yeah.

1533
01:29:21,840 --> 01:29:25,560
Did you ever take anything that
enhances your performance? And I said,

1534
01:29:25,561 --> 01:29:29,950
I've never failed a test.
Yeah.

1535
01:29:30,240 --> 01:29:35,070
It's so rampant now. You're right in all
immune. The questioning. It's rampant.

1536
01:29:35,190 --> 01:29:39,540
Yeah. It's in football.
It's crazy. Like, yeah.

1537
01:29:39,630 --> 01:29:43,950
Without question. I just think it's a
part of the sport of track and field.

1538
01:29:43,980 --> 01:29:45,810
I think it's a part of
the sport of cycling.

1539
01:29:46,230 --> 01:29:49,490
It's at least appears to be
a part of the sport of MMA.

1540
01:29:49,800 --> 01:29:53,370
There's a guy who was running the
California Athletic Commission right now.

1541
01:29:53,371 --> 01:29:56,520
His name is Andy Foster and he's very
smart dude and he's doing a really smart

1542
01:29:56,521 --> 01:29:58,860
thing. One of the things
he's doing, first of all,

1543
01:29:58,861 --> 01:30:02,730
he's got a long history in martial arts.

1544
01:30:02,760 --> 01:30:04,770
He's actually fought himself.
He's competed,

1545
01:30:04,771 --> 01:30:07,830
he's been a martial artists
for a long stretch of his life.

1546
01:30:08,130 --> 01:30:12,120
So he's really aware of the
culture. He understands it. And uh,

1547
01:30:12,180 --> 01:30:17,180
he decided after this last UFC two blood
and piss test everybody instead of just

1548
01:30:18,091 --> 01:30:20,340
doing like the people
that are in the main car,

1549
01:30:20,790 --> 01:30:24,870
instead of doing the blood tests on a
select few and championship bouts cause

1550
01:30:24,880 --> 01:30:26,480
they're, they're really expensive. Yeah.

1551
01:30:26,520 --> 01:30:31,260
Like they cost as much as $40,000
for each blood test. What? Yeah,

1552
01:30:31,410 --> 01:30:35,310
so I don't know what the California
State Athletic Commission did when they

1553
01:30:35,311 --> 01:30:36,150
financed that.

1554
01:30:36,151 --> 01:30:38,670
I don't know how much they paid for it
and he didn't want to talk about it.

1555
01:30:38,790 --> 01:30:39,420
But what he does,

1556
01:30:39,420 --> 01:30:43,290
what did say was they were going to
do comprehensive blood screenings of

1557
01:30:43,291 --> 01:30:47,180
everyone that competed. And he goes, if
there's anyone that's hiding something,

1558
01:30:47,200 --> 01:30:48,033
we're going to find it.

1559
01:30:48,050 --> 01:30:51,360
And if you're hiding something that
you wouldn't detect with urine,

1560
01:30:51,510 --> 01:30:53,930
we're going to find it with blood.
So and so.

1561
01:30:53,940 --> 01:30:57,630
Most people didn't expect these
tests, so we'll see what happens. Wow.

1562
01:30:57,720 --> 01:31:02,340
But I mean there's been so many people
that have been caught in the UFC over the

1563
01:31:02,340 --> 01:31:04,260
past few months.
And then other MMA organizations,

1564
01:31:04,530 --> 01:31:06,390
it's pretty hard to
deny that it's an issue.

1565
01:31:06,420 --> 01:31:10,500
It's just how much of an issue is it is
the big question. That's true. Yeah. Yeah.

1566
01:31:10,501 --> 01:31:12,840
And you know,
and the more the the testing,

1567
01:31:12,841 --> 01:31:17,841
we'll get more complex and more advanced
and then so will the next performance

1568
01:31:19,231 --> 01:31:20,400
enhancing drug. You know, it,

1569
01:31:20,730 --> 01:31:23,850
they just keep getting better at designing
them and then they have to get better

1570
01:31:23,851 --> 01:31:27,150
at detecting them. But that's like,
we'll never end. No, never. And not well,

1571
01:31:27,151 --> 01:31:31,590
there's competitors who want to win
and there's lots of money on the line.

1572
01:31:31,710 --> 01:31:33,420
It will never end.
Yeah.

1573
01:31:33,450 --> 01:31:36,450
I think they're just going to keep
figuring out new ways to manipulate the

1574
01:31:36,451 --> 01:31:41,000
system. New, new bath salts. No new
creams that you rub in and yeah.

1575
01:31:41,210 --> 01:31:45,750
You know they make we'd bass
off. No, no. Oh yes they do.
And I'm, I mean bath salts,

1576
01:31:45,751 --> 01:31:49,650
like that smokey shit that he makes
me, you know, makes you crazy. Yeah.

1577
01:31:50,100 --> 01:31:52,670
I mean basketball is like, you put
it in the bath. Yeah, I saw you.

1578
01:31:52,690 --> 01:31:54,390
You say you've been taking them a lot.
You've been doing this.

1579
01:31:54,391 --> 01:31:58,950
I've been doing just regular bath of
Epsom salts and you don't have a tank.

1580
01:31:58,990 --> 01:32:02,050
The isolation tank shoots all Epsom
salt too, but it doesn't get hot.

1581
01:32:02,260 --> 01:32:06,870
It's really hot one. Yeah, the Bass, I get
hot and you feel much better after that.

1582
01:32:06,871 --> 01:32:09,520
My God, it was like everything
is so loose and relaxed.

1583
01:32:10,180 --> 01:32:12,310
EPSOM salts have some old school shit,
dude.

1584
01:32:12,311 --> 01:32:15,140
They figure that out a long time ago
and you do the cryo thing to write.

1585
01:32:15,810 --> 01:32:19,230
All those things are good to be
proactive with your health. Tom,

1586
01:32:20,200 --> 01:32:23,170
proactive with your health. I got
a them, but I look forward to it.

1587
01:32:23,171 --> 01:32:26,920
You got to portray that love Jesus. That's
true. A lot to talk about him a yeah,

1588
01:32:26,950 --> 01:32:29,970
sure. Great depth. I don't think he
talks to me. He listens to the bishop.

1589
01:32:30,160 --> 01:32:33,580
If he does, you got to find anybody
that my last session know some shit.

1590
01:32:34,360 --> 01:32:36,640
I got another guy for you. Don't
worry about it. Okay, cool.

1591
01:32:37,130 --> 01:32:38,650
So tell me what he does to you.

1592
01:32:39,270 --> 01:32:43,560
He, I'm like, we'll just be
hired a trainer working out.

1593
01:32:43,590 --> 01:32:47,340
He's a good trainer, knows his stuff. I
would say that works me out really hard.

1594
01:32:47,430 --> 01:32:51,330
I've really enjoyed it.
I've been progressing. It's
been good. Losing weight,

1595
01:32:51,331 --> 01:32:53,380
getting strong, all that's good. Um,

1596
01:32:53,460 --> 01:32:58,460
but then like he'll just drop some
Jesus Christ stuff on me sometimes.

1597
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:03,240
And uh, yeah. Well, you know what I,
you know, when I started to think about,

1598
01:33:03,270 --> 01:33:05,730
I was like, I'd worked with
different trainers, you know,

1599
01:33:05,731 --> 01:33:09,870
over the course of my life. I feel like
they all have like one, like a weird,

1600
01:33:10,170 --> 01:33:13,760
they always have like kind of something
about their personality, you know? Yes.

1601
01:33:14,040 --> 01:33:17,430
Some of them will like you ask them
one thing and they'll give you their

1602
01:33:17,431 --> 01:33:21,390
philosophy on, you know, their, their
life philosophy and you're like, yeah,

1603
01:33:21,391 --> 01:33:23,640
I just went, are we doing another
set? Like you just kind of like,

1604
01:33:24,030 --> 01:33:26,370
you know what I mean? Like some of them
will download about their love life,

1605
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:28,350
like they have quirks and him,

1606
01:33:28,620 --> 01:33:31,250
it'll just be like in the middle of
working out and then he'll be like, uh,

1607
01:33:32,010 --> 01:33:34,200
you could stop there.
Or when I went in I was like,

1608
01:33:34,201 --> 01:33:36,960
I had a respiratory thing and I go,
Hey,

1609
01:33:36,961 --> 01:33:41,961
today can we just do like heavy but kind
of not keep heart rate up really high

1610
01:33:42,631 --> 01:33:44,940
so I'm not breathing because my lungs
are bothering me. And he was like,

1611
01:33:45,030 --> 01:33:48,900
absolutely. Then we start working out
and like I'm just running all over it.

1612
01:33:48,901 --> 01:33:52,590
He's having me do box jumps and run and
I'm just like, thanks for ignoring me.

1613
01:33:52,700 --> 01:33:55,980
Like, and he goes, you know,
I, I remember you said that,

1614
01:33:55,981 --> 01:33:59,760
but then you know you've been fine and
like he won't let me push you too hard.

1615
01:34:00,030 --> 01:34:03,900
And I was like, what? And he goes like,
like if I was pushing you too hard,

1616
01:34:03,901 --> 01:34:07,560
Jesus will go like, Hey, like
take it easy on him. Jesus Christ,

1617
01:34:07,561 --> 01:34:12,330
you've got to get out of there man.
He'd go, oh, all right, so next set.

1618
01:34:12,400 --> 01:34:14,250
Like should we just go to the next thing?
Then?

1619
01:34:14,280 --> 01:34:19,170
Like I just see the thing I've learned
about people is that when you ask

1620
01:34:19,171 --> 01:34:24,171
questions at those moments is when
they'll really take it to the next level.

1621
01:34:24,960 --> 01:34:26,880
So I'm very,
uh,

1622
01:34:26,881 --> 01:34:31,881
aware that by engaging that part of the
conversation will lead to more of it.

1623
01:34:32,370 --> 01:34:35,370
So what I do normally it was when
it comes up, I just, I'll go, like,

1624
01:34:35,670 --> 01:34:38,070
I'll nod and be like, yeah, all right,

1625
01:34:38,071 --> 01:34:41,820
I'm going to do this next one and I'll
just move on because that's how it,

1626
01:34:41,940 --> 01:34:45,300
that part of the conversation dies. And
then it shifted to something else. Like,

1627
01:34:45,301 --> 01:34:46,320
like I was leaving on,

1628
01:34:46,350 --> 01:34:51,350
I went on like a little mini tour last
week and right before I left I was with

1629
01:34:51,421 --> 01:34:55,680
him and we just finished the work and I
was like, yeah, you know, um, I just, uh,

1630
01:34:55,980 --> 01:34:58,970
just hope I, you know, I don't
fall off too much on this week off.

1631
01:34:59,230 --> 01:35:02,780
That's was basically baiting
for like motivation and,

1632
01:35:03,120 --> 01:35:04,700
and like some type of game plan,

1633
01:35:04,701 --> 01:35:09,560
like tried to cardio Thursday and
maybe do, you know, this and that fry,

1634
01:35:09,590 --> 01:35:12,050
like that kind of thing. And
so I was like, yeah, you know,

1635
01:35:12,051 --> 01:35:15,680
so I just hope my progress doesn't
die down. He goes, well, you know,

1636
01:35:15,681 --> 01:35:19,730
we always try to do stuff on her own,
but like the thing is like if you,

1637
01:35:19,790 --> 01:35:23,830
if you ask Jesus for help, he'll give
it to you. And I was just like, I,

1638
01:35:24,170 --> 01:35:27,330
I just want to know like,
how many reps I should Friday

1639
01:35:29,610 --> 01:35:31,100
did you write me up a program?

1640
01:35:31,430 --> 01:35:36,010
And so we can put all that Jesus stuff
in there to just highlight that no one to

1641
01:35:36,011 --> 01:35:38,840
go. Yeah. And he goes, you know,
you don't do anything on our own.

1642
01:35:38,930 --> 01:35:42,020
Like he's there helping us and he loves,
when we asked for a kind of white guy,

1643
01:35:42,080 --> 01:35:45,020
white guy, and I go, all right, man,

1644
01:35:46,040 --> 01:35:49,520
it's Junky or what? Yeah, yeah,

1645
01:35:50,470 --> 01:35:54,470
I guess once you see, so what's
the background? Well, he's not.

1646
01:35:54,471 --> 01:35:58,490
And if he likes junkie x, he's just
x. Uh, adrenaline got like everything.

1647
01:35:58,730 --> 01:36:02,810
Adrenaline Jayke everything. But no, but
like I think drugs to haul everything.

1648
01:36:03,410 --> 01:36:06,070
Yeah. Yeah. Good. Nice guy too.

1649
01:36:06,850 --> 01:36:09,320
I met a bunch of them that are nice guy.
Very nice guy.

1650
01:36:09,410 --> 01:36:11,960
And you can't deny the
effectiveness of that.

1651
01:36:12,260 --> 01:36:17,210
Like using like a religion in your
life for a lot of people. Yes.

1652
01:36:17,211 --> 01:36:20,630
It does work. And I believe in it.
I think that it pro the, you know,

1653
01:36:20,660 --> 01:36:21,260
my whole thing is,

1654
01:36:21,260 --> 01:36:25,950
I think it probably does really does
work and do something for him. Yeah.

1655
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,580
You know, and I don't,
I don't, uh, you know,

1656
01:36:28,680 --> 01:36:30,590
there was just something for a
lot of people. Yeah, exactly.

1657
01:36:30,710 --> 01:36:33,260
It doesn't mean it's real,
but it's like a placebo.

1658
01:36:33,290 --> 01:36:37,190
Like she should it be okay to sell
someone a sugar pill and tell them that it

1659
01:36:37,191 --> 01:36:41,870
cures cancer. No, but what if you do that
and it cures or cancer. Right, right.

1660
01:36:42,080 --> 01:36:44,600
Well, that's what religion
is for a lot of folks.

1661
01:36:44,601 --> 01:36:48,830
Like there's a lot of people that if
you tell them that the Lord is watching

1662
01:36:48,831 --> 01:36:52,720
over them and then everything's going to
be amazing, they have now that covers.

1663
01:36:52,721 --> 01:36:56,900
Sure, okay. As long as I pay my homage
to the Lord, pay my respects to the Lord,

1664
01:36:57,110 --> 01:36:59,570
I do my praying, I make sure
to do that. I'm covered.

1665
01:36:59,930 --> 01:37:01,220
God's going to make
sure everything's cool.

1666
01:37:01,460 --> 01:37:04,550
And that alone will give you like
a certain amount of relaxation.

1667
01:37:04,580 --> 01:37:08,420
A certain amount of a big part of why
it doesn't like really freak me out is

1668
01:37:08,421 --> 01:37:12,710
that my mother's pretty much exactly
like that. Oh, okay. So you know,

1669
01:37:12,740 --> 01:37:14,650
like she owned it.
Yeah,

1670
01:37:14,690 --> 01:37:17,810
she's dialed it back to
me because she's like,

1671
01:37:17,811 --> 01:37:21,650
you're 35 and you're still not
doing it. But she's, you know,

1672
01:37:21,680 --> 01:37:25,430
but like I grew up with like, you know,
rosaries everywhere, crosses everywhere.

1673
01:37:25,760 --> 01:37:28,850
You know, if we take a 10 minute car
ride, she was like, let's play the rosary.

1674
01:37:28,851 --> 01:37:31,820
And like, you know, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Either rose or, sorry, pray the rosary,

1675
01:37:32,540 --> 01:37:34,680
the rosary on a 10 minute car ride.

1676
01:37:34,850 --> 01:37:38,630
What do you do during the time that car
rides? What do you have to like, uh,

1677
01:37:38,660 --> 01:37:39,140
you know,

1678
01:37:39,140 --> 01:37:42,890
our father and then 10 hail Mary's and
then another our fathers 10 hail Mary's.

1679
01:37:43,190 --> 01:37:47,180
You do 50 hail Marys because it's a
10 or 15 minute car ride. Yeah, yeah.

1680
01:37:47,510 --> 01:37:50,990
Pray before meals pre, you know, that
kind of stuff. And then she's like,

1681
01:37:51,860 --> 01:37:56,100
if I tell her like, you know, hey,
this is great. I, uh, he just sold out

1682
01:37:56,100 --> 01:38:00,870
this show, uh, in Atlanta.
It was great. And she's like,

1683
01:38:00,871 --> 01:38:05,100
did you thank God? And I'm like,
I was about to, I called you,

1684
01:38:06,550 --> 01:38:08,880
you know,
tell you the story about how it was.

1685
01:38:09,450 --> 01:38:11,880
There was this girl in college
that I thought was in to me,

1686
01:38:11,910 --> 01:38:15,060
which was really just trying to get me
to go to one of these Christian retreats.

1687
01:38:15,150 --> 01:38:19,220
No. Oh, such adult. Uh,

1688
01:38:19,380 --> 01:38:23,350
this really hot Puerto Rican girl
who wore glasses. She was really,

1689
01:38:23,400 --> 01:38:26,490
she was really sexy and a,
I was so,

1690
01:38:26,730 --> 01:38:29,260
I had no idea what was going on.
I thought like,

1691
01:38:29,340 --> 01:38:32,160
this girl wants me to join
her and her friends and party.

1692
01:38:32,580 --> 01:38:34,880
So we're all hanging out.
Um,

1693
01:38:35,160 --> 01:38:37,950
we're in class and she was constantly
trying to get me to go to these things and

1694
01:38:37,951 --> 01:38:39,630
I couldn't do it because back then,

1695
01:38:39,660 --> 01:38:42,570
a lot of times I was fighting
and tournaments. So I was, uh,

1696
01:38:43,140 --> 01:38:46,340
talking to her and um,
no,

1697
01:38:46,370 --> 01:38:50,110
no subject of religion.
No, no topics were brought.

1698
01:38:50,130 --> 01:38:54,240
It was just normal lifestyle, religion,
never even, it was never, hey,

1699
01:38:54,241 --> 01:38:58,590
come out to these parties, we're going
to have a Christian get together. Um,

1700
01:38:58,680 --> 01:38:59,880
it was just normal talk.

1701
01:38:59,881 --> 01:39:04,250
And then one day we were at a
cafeteria during lunch and I came in,

1702
01:39:04,280 --> 01:39:08,990
I sat down and I said, did you guys hear
that there was a plane crash landed, uh,

1703
01:39:09,100 --> 01:39:13,380
at the airport? And they're
like, oh no. What happened?
Was anyone hurt? And I go, no,

1704
01:39:13,381 --> 01:39:17,580
no, the, the front landing gear
didn't go down and it had a skid,

1705
01:39:17,670 --> 01:39:21,830
but everybody's fine. And so they all
go, praise God. Oh, praise God. I want

1706
01:39:23,430 --> 01:39:28,320
all of them. Oh No. And then I
just started like, Oh, you idiot.

1707
01:39:28,350 --> 01:39:30,090
You thought she thought you were hot.

1708
01:39:30,630 --> 01:39:34,590
She's just trying to suck you
into the calls. Yeah. And so I go,

1709
01:39:35,160 --> 01:39:38,070
praise God, he think God had something
to do with that. It was just like the,

1710
01:39:38,071 --> 01:39:41,040
if God was around, like why would he
make the landing gear come back out?

1711
01:39:41,400 --> 01:39:44,700
Like why would he just make everybody
be okay because the landing gear didn't

1712
01:39:44,701 --> 01:39:48,060
work, wouldn't he fix the landing
gear? So everybody didn't die.

1713
01:39:48,570 --> 01:39:52,560
He likes mechanical things. He does
stuff. And I forget what the response was,

1714
01:39:52,561 --> 01:39:55,440
but there were, there were
very upset with me. And uh,

1715
01:39:55,650 --> 01:39:57,900
we got into this religious conversation.
So I'm like,

1716
01:39:57,901 --> 01:40:00,840
so you guys are like super religious and
like I had to know like what was going

1717
01:40:00,841 --> 01:40:03,030
on. So I go, so what are these
parties, what you guys do? Well,

1718
01:40:03,031 --> 01:40:06,120
we get together and we talk about the
Lord and we like to bring other people

1719
01:40:06,270 --> 01:40:08,940
into the Lord so they understand
how we feel about the Lord.

1720
01:40:09,150 --> 01:40:11,460
Because a lot of people,
they just don't have exposure to the Lord.

1721
01:40:11,461 --> 01:40:14,760
And I was like, oh dammit.
Yeah, he won't choose hot.

1722
01:40:14,790 --> 01:40:17,970
I think she was dirty when she was younger
and she's trying to make up for the

1723
01:40:17,971 --> 01:40:22,860
dirty cause she has smelled like sex
and I don't mean like snagajob. Yeah,

1724
01:40:22,890 --> 01:40:27,890
I mean like she was like sexy God and
she was like the little coyote that they

1725
01:40:28,081 --> 01:40:31,560
would put out that's in heat and tricks
dogs to going out into the woods and the

1726
01:40:31,561 --> 01:40:35,820
other coyotes jump them and eat them.
That's what she was really, yeah. Glasses,

1727
01:40:35,821 --> 01:40:39,430
sexy recruiting dudes.
Just ways would you cut?

1728
01:40:39,540 --> 01:40:42,570
It was like down the Cape.
So it was like a significant trip.

1729
01:40:42,571 --> 01:40:45,630
You'd had to go and stay with them and
hang out for the weekend. And I was like,

1730
01:40:45,631 --> 01:40:48,300
what are you guys going to
do when we have this party?

1731
01:40:48,300 --> 01:40:51,030
It's going to be really amazing.
A lot of our friends come down.

1732
01:40:51,210 --> 01:40:55,870
I sat next to a girl on a flight who,
a book about Saint Peter and I was like,

1733
01:40:56,500 --> 01:41:00,890
oh, we started talking about the book and
then we started talking about, you know,

1734
01:41:01,210 --> 01:41:05,290
Christ. And she was, she was, I started
asking her more questions and she goes,

1735
01:41:05,291 --> 01:41:09,760
yeah, you know, like, um, I just came
to this kind of conclusion. There was,

1736
01:41:09,761 --> 01:41:13,470
it was difficult, but like, if
you don't accept Christ, you know,

1737
01:41:13,480 --> 01:41:18,340
like you'll definitely go to
hell. And I go, uh, I go, well,

1738
01:41:18,700 --> 01:41:22,210
one of my first thoughts, if you, if
you were to say that, it would be like,

1739
01:41:22,211 --> 01:41:26,680
what about like all the Jews and
Muslims in the world? And she goes,

1740
01:41:26,710 --> 01:41:29,830
they're going to hell.
And I was like, Jesus,

1741
01:41:30,970 --> 01:41:34,660
that's really intense. I know you
think they all go to hell. She goes,

1742
01:41:34,661 --> 01:41:38,940
unfortunately, unless they, uh, accept
Christ, they will. And I was like,

1743
01:41:38,941 --> 01:41:41,890
what a fucking crazy reality
to have in your head. Wow.

1744
01:41:41,920 --> 01:41:44,310
That's the reality that you walk around
with you everywhere you go. Like,

1745
01:41:44,320 --> 01:41:48,730
excuse me. You, you must listen to
me. You must listen to me. Yeah.

1746
01:41:49,960 --> 01:41:51,550
Maybe you know me.
My name is Kirk Cameron,

1747
01:41:52,030 --> 01:41:55,900
and I'm here to tell you that if you
don't listen to me and listen to Lauren,

1748
01:41:56,140 --> 01:41:58,690
you're going to go to hell.
That's fry.

1749
01:41:58,880 --> 01:42:02,020
There's no air conditioning and his
fucking, this is going to be demons.

1750
01:42:02,470 --> 01:42:06,790
They stick pork forks up your asshole.
So it going to go to hell. Yeah.

1751
01:42:06,910 --> 01:42:09,550
When you take it there, it's like,
all right, let's be done with this.

1752
01:42:09,551 --> 01:42:10,420
Have you ever seen that?

1753
01:42:10,421 --> 01:42:15,010
There's an ancient Italian painting
that's on the roof of some cathedral and

1754
01:42:15,011 --> 01:42:16,800
it's all like the,
the,

1755
01:42:16,801 --> 01:42:21,801
the rooftop painting represents like a
heaven and all the way down to hell and

1756
01:42:22,331 --> 01:42:23,610
the outskirts like the,

1757
01:42:23,611 --> 01:42:28,611
the bottom layer represents a hell and
there's actual demons and people that are

1758
01:42:30,101 --> 01:42:35,101
down there getting tortured by demons in
the painting and the demons are shoving

1759
01:42:35,500 --> 01:42:40,210
like pitchforks ups up people's asses now.
Yeah.

1760
01:42:40,950 --> 01:42:45,340
Jamie, you'll find it. Look at this
Sistine Chapel, Sistine Chapel.

1761
01:42:45,370 --> 01:42:47,440
That's an assistant.
That's the Sistine chapel dude.

1762
01:42:47,740 --> 01:42:52,360
Those are demons and it's just one of
them. I mean there's the, the, they exist.

1763
01:42:52,361 --> 01:42:56,770
These kinds of images exist on
several different paintings. Look,

1764
01:42:57,490 --> 01:43:01,240
fucking demons and how
they're getting dragged.

1765
01:43:02,440 --> 01:43:04,810
Whoa.
I don't even know if that's the only one.

1766
01:43:04,840 --> 01:43:07,930
I don't cause I don't see the pitch fork
up the ass one. There's another one.

1767
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,870
Check to see if we can find some other
ones, but we get that demon men now.

1768
01:43:10,871 --> 01:43:11,840
What are you waiting for?
Come.

1769
01:43:11,870 --> 01:43:14,650
There's no rule book or in the middle
where the like that happens. Then you go,

1770
01:43:14,651 --> 01:43:19,150
okay. Okay. Okay. I except I, I'm with you
now. Nope. Too late. God dammit. I mean,

1771
01:43:19,151 --> 01:43:24,100
sorry. Well, it's because it was written
by morons. Like it doesn't make any sense.

1772
01:43:24,130 --> 01:43:27,520
It doesn't make no sense.
Why would God only tell those people?

1773
01:43:27,550 --> 01:43:31,330
How about tell us too.
If God came down and told us how to live,

1774
01:43:31,480 --> 01:43:35,260
we would all be like, okay, yeah,
you're right there. Now we know. Oh,

1775
01:43:35,261 --> 01:43:38,680
we have to be told by our
grandparents called having faith.

1776
01:43:38,770 --> 01:43:43,270
That's what you always
get the faith thing. Oh,

1777
01:43:43,271 --> 01:43:47,830
by the way, another awesome black person
when I got Michael's is not. I know. Okay,

1778
01:43:47,890 --> 01:43:50,380
but when I got off the plane yesterday,
Deion Sanders was right there.

1779
01:43:50,420 --> 01:43:52,190
Really hadn't been on the phone

1780
01:43:52,460 --> 01:43:55,940
standing next to whom I believe was
his daughter. I would have totally,

1781
01:43:56,210 --> 01:43:57,710
I did throw it like a sub prime

1782
01:43:59,540 --> 01:44:00,373
and he was,

1783
01:44:02,300 --> 01:44:05,170
he was in the middle of a conversation
on his phone, so I knew like, no,

1784
01:44:05,180 --> 01:44:08,720
don't like, it's like, hey man. But he
was like talking to some, I go sub prime,

1785
01:44:08,721 --> 01:44:11,270
I stuck out my hand. But he was like,
yeah. So he's like, all right man.

1786
01:44:11,271 --> 01:44:16,220
So I capital kept talking. Yeah.
That's cool. That's cool. That's good.

1787
01:44:16,250 --> 01:44:18,360
Deanna is,
it's not a line of people trying to excel.

1788
01:44:19,270 --> 01:44:23,870
You started selfie rumble.
I wouldn't do that to Neon Dionne.

1789
01:44:24,040 --> 01:44:27,890
That's beautiful. What is this
thing that you do on your podcast,

1790
01:44:27,891 --> 01:44:30,740
which is a hilarious podcast too.
I really enjoyed the all,

1791
01:44:30,741 --> 01:44:33,740
we had those a lot of the best time with
you. We had a great time. It was fun.

1792
01:44:33,890 --> 01:44:38,240
It's called your mom's house and you
guys, you do it. You have live shows,

1793
01:44:38,300 --> 01:44:41,840
which I still have to see because I keep
hearing amazing things about him a lot.

1794
01:44:41,870 --> 01:44:45,260
I get a lot of Twitter messages for
people that are senior live shows.

1795
01:44:45,290 --> 01:44:48,950
It's so far we're doing it this, this
Sunday in San Francisco at cops. Oh Shit.

1796
01:44:48,951 --> 01:44:53,340
Shit. Um, you guys have a bunch
of games that you play? Yeah,

1797
01:44:53,450 --> 01:44:57,560
we play segments. One of them was
black or Tom. Yeah. Tom Or blind. Yes.

1798
01:44:57,561 --> 01:45:00,740
Tom Or black where you imitate
black people and then you know,

1799
01:45:00,741 --> 01:45:05,360
actual recordings of black
people talking. Yes. And I,

1800
01:45:05,361 --> 01:45:07,790
did anybody ever call you racist for that?
Sure.

1801
01:45:12,500 --> 01:45:14,030
What's the argument?
What do they say?

1802
01:45:14,750 --> 01:45:16,550
They say black people don't
really talk like that.

1803
01:45:16,580 --> 01:45:20,250
It's really some black people don't
really know to be honest with you. It's,

1804
01:45:20,251 --> 01:45:24,230
it's very minimal. It's not, not a lot
of people say that I think because,

1805
01:45:24,260 --> 01:45:28,190
well I think that like,
I think people really know intent.

1806
01:45:28,490 --> 01:45:33,080
I think people really gauge.
Oh, that's hilarious. You
Online, do you read Twitter?

1807
01:45:33,140 --> 01:45:36,290
Well, no, I'm saying like as far
as like a listener of our show,

1808
01:45:37,300 --> 01:45:40,220
I don't think that they go,
you're being super racist.

1809
01:45:40,490 --> 01:45:42,720
I think that they like to me for,

1810
01:45:42,721 --> 01:45:45,410
for doing the game and
doing like a black voice,

1811
01:45:45,440 --> 01:45:48,080
but it's not the listeners of your
show that you have to worry about.

1812
01:45:48,081 --> 01:45:49,640
It's people find out about your show.

1813
01:45:49,670 --> 01:45:53,960
You're not listening to then think it's
cute to ride a salon.com article about

1814
01:45:53,961 --> 01:45:58,900
everything that's wrong with podcasting.
Your Mom's house races, races, phobic,

1815
01:45:58,910 --> 01:46:03,770
you know, Fart worshiping.
Yeah. I mean, on my special,

1816
01:46:03,800 --> 01:46:06,530
my special has,
I don't do the game,

1817
01:46:06,650 --> 01:46:09,470
but I basically have a bit
that's kind of in line with that.

1818
01:46:10,210 --> 01:46:13,710
Talk about shouting black as black
people and trying to trick them. So,

1819
01:46:14,530 --> 01:46:18,110
and how I did it to big daddy came one
time. So like I have a bit about that.

1820
01:46:18,290 --> 01:46:21,260
And of course, like if you go at, you read
some of the reviews, people were like,

1821
01:46:21,440 --> 01:46:24,830
this was super racist, this guy
did that. I think they're silly.

1822
01:46:24,831 --> 01:46:29,240
I think they're nonsense. I think. I think
most people get that. Like, you know,

1823
01:46:29,300 --> 01:46:32,240
that bit came out of like, it's, it's,

1824
01:46:32,380 --> 01:46:37,310
it's really out of like love. It's
out of like total, uh, from, from,

1825
01:46:37,340 --> 01:46:42,200
from my point of view, like
adoration of, uh, black daddy cake,

1826
01:46:42,201 --> 01:46:45,350
Daddy Kane, black culture.
Absolutely. So that's true. You,

1827
01:46:45,351 --> 01:46:49,010
you're a big rap fan I think. I think
people pick up on that. I think they do.

1828
01:46:49,050 --> 01:46:51,500
So anybody who knows you
knows you're not a racist.

1829
01:46:51,510 --> 01:46:54,900
Anybody listens to your podcast, knows
that you love to be silly. Of course,

1830
01:46:55,260 --> 01:46:59,190
that's a silly show. You and your wife
are both ridiculously silly and your show,

1831
01:46:59,200 --> 01:47:03,540
it's at all a comic couples that I know
you guys are without a doubt the best,

1832
01:47:03,750 --> 01:47:05,460
but also the best together.

1833
01:47:05,730 --> 01:47:09,360
Like you're not just funny people that
happened to be married to each other.

1834
01:47:09,480 --> 01:47:11,640
Like you guys work off each
other like really well.

1835
01:47:11,670 --> 01:47:15,570
We have a really good pair of shoes.
Yeah, you guys are hilarious. It's so fun.

1836
01:47:16,020 --> 01:47:18,720
But that black or Tom
or Tom or black thing,

1837
01:47:18,900 --> 01:47:21,990
that's one of those things where like
are we pretending that there aren't black

1838
01:47:21,991 --> 01:47:24,240
people that talk like that? Like what
are these videos that we're watching?

1839
01:47:24,510 --> 01:47:27,090
You watch pimps opposed down who
are these people? Are they actors?

1840
01:47:27,330 --> 01:47:31,590
Is this a role? Is this preposterous?
It's insane if you like.

1841
01:47:31,900 --> 01:47:33,420
It's one of those things
too where it's like,

1842
01:47:33,421 --> 01:47:36,930
I know the person that does that goes
black people don't talk like that. Right?

1843
01:47:36,931 --> 01:47:39,330
They'd be like, you're, you're making
a mockery of life. The, and I go,

1844
01:47:39,360 --> 01:47:42,300
what my response would be like,
well, you're right that all people,

1845
01:47:42,310 --> 01:47:44,880
black people don't talk like that.
But you know,

1846
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:49,500
some black people somewhere do
do a, what's that play? Blah.

1847
01:47:49,810 --> 01:47:54,600
Tom Ha, I'm a Holler at you later. That's,
he's a guy who talks like that for sure.

1848
01:47:54,630 --> 01:47:58,110
But it's cute that you're not allowed to
do it because of the color of your skin

1849
01:47:58,220 --> 01:48:00,720
because of where your parents
were born or whatever.

1850
01:48:01,050 --> 01:48:05,040
But a black guy could do the exact
same voice the exact same way.

1851
01:48:05,820 --> 01:48:09,030
All white guys are like,
Hey, yeah, Richard Pryor,

1852
01:48:09,330 --> 01:48:11,190
you started that off and then how many,

1853
01:48:11,220 --> 01:48:15,180
how many black comics did that after that?
But they did it bad was prior.

1854
01:48:15,181 --> 01:48:19,310
Prior was much more subtle. My mom, she's
a great old Gal. Right, right, right.

1855
01:48:19,320 --> 01:48:22,680
I mean, nobody had really done that back
then when he was doing it, you know? Yeah.

1856
01:48:22,681 --> 01:48:26,850
When I did, I did a bit about the
first 48 where like, you know, it's,

1857
01:48:27,060 --> 01:48:28,630
I break down the show.
Right.

1858
01:48:28,980 --> 01:48:33,980
And how there's some really aggressive
black guys on that show yelling crazy

1859
01:48:34,801 --> 01:48:37,020
shit. And I do an impression of it, dude.

1860
01:48:37,110 --> 01:48:42,110
I the the biggest response of
like positive flipping out,

1861
01:48:42,451 --> 01:48:47,130
holy shit reaction was always in crowds
where there's a lot of black people.

1862
01:48:47,160 --> 01:48:49,560
Yeah. Because they're not offended
by it. They're not offended.

1863
01:48:49,561 --> 01:48:53,650
They know it's true. Yeah. And if
also someone's secure. Yeah. They're,

1864
01:48:53,651 --> 01:48:56,010
they're not going to worry like what
you saying? We're all like that.

1865
01:48:56,370 --> 01:48:59,130
What kind of crazy person
says all like that. Of course,

1866
01:48:59,160 --> 01:49:03,060
you know everything else you've, you've,
you've saw all this other material.

1867
01:49:03,150 --> 01:49:05,730
You laughed at all this sudden you
saw this other insight and you think,

1868
01:49:05,760 --> 01:49:09,150
oh but it's all just a trick to get you
to laugh at some racist shit cause I'm a

1869
01:49:09,151 --> 01:49:10,260
racist. Yeah. And then,

1870
01:49:10,420 --> 01:49:15,420
and I think that black people who really
flipped out and loved that bit we're

1871
01:49:15,481 --> 01:49:16,500
doing, cause they were like, yeah,

1872
01:49:16,501 --> 01:49:20,580
they've seen the first 48 and they
know exactly what I'm highlighting.

1873
01:49:20,670 --> 01:49:23,480
They know what I'm making fun
of. You know, if you were black,

1874
01:49:23,481 --> 01:49:25,980
you could do it with no problem.
Absolutely. But if you're white,

1875
01:49:26,550 --> 01:49:28,550
you can do white voices.
You can do like no,

1876
01:49:28,620 --> 01:49:31,110
no one ever gets mad at
you doing a redneck voice.

1877
01:49:31,640 --> 01:49:36,180
100% but black people could do the redneck
voice too. Right? That's different.

1878
01:49:36,181 --> 01:49:39,780
That is true. They can mock rednecks
all day long and no one says a peep.

1879
01:49:39,781 --> 01:49:42,720
No one cares. No one cares.
Yeah. Anybody can mock rednecks.

1880
01:49:42,840 --> 01:49:47,190
Rednecks mock themselves. Yeah. Jeff
Foxworthy. You might be a redneck

1881
01:49:48,160 --> 01:49:52,570
if your mama and your daddy live in. Yeah,
of course. Yeah. You might be a redneck,

1882
01:49:52,650 --> 01:49:56,080
you know it's mocking rednecks.
Nobody cares. Yeah. Cause he's white.

1883
01:49:56,110 --> 01:50:00,780
If your uncle's trousers right in
the yard. But if he was black, yeah.

1884
01:50:00,840 --> 01:50:03,850
Still know who care. True.
Like black people are,

1885
01:50:03,851 --> 01:50:07,860
they have full license to
make fun of white people and
white culture. Yeah, sure.

1886
01:50:08,260 --> 01:50:11,520
I think we all kind of accept that.
Right? I mean like that's, there's,

1887
01:50:11,660 --> 01:50:16,420
there's no argument against it because
part of it is because, you know, like the,

1888
01:50:16,810 --> 01:50:20,140
the kind of the, the ladder,
the socioeconomic ladder.

1889
01:50:20,470 --> 01:50:22,300
So it's like if you're a white male,

1890
01:50:22,600 --> 01:50:25,960
you're automatically perceived
as you have it the best.

1891
01:50:26,350 --> 01:50:29,040
So like you making, you have to be, it's,

1892
01:50:29,170 --> 01:50:31,210
it's about like what you're making fun of.

1893
01:50:31,660 --> 01:50:36,550
You can make fun of the other races
where you can make a joke involving race,

1894
01:50:36,551 --> 01:50:39,370
but like what's your angle on it?
If you're just like, you know,

1895
01:50:39,430 --> 01:50:41,110
fucking these people are just dumb.

1896
01:50:41,530 --> 01:50:45,580
Like that's going to be a racist thing
to say. But if you're making a point,

1897
01:50:45,610 --> 01:50:48,790
like there's some joke, something
you're specifying, then it's,

1898
01:50:48,850 --> 01:50:51,100
I think you can accept the joke.
You know?

1899
01:50:51,130 --> 01:50:53,590
Also when it comes to like super
progressive or liberal people,

1900
01:50:53,591 --> 01:50:54,370
there's always this,

1901
01:50:54,370 --> 01:50:58,510
this mindset you're supposed to punch
up so the minorities punching up at the

1902
01:50:58,511 --> 01:51:01,940
white people would always be the correct
thing, right? It's always allowed.

1903
01:51:02,200 --> 01:51:07,000
Like perfect example, like
a famous person. Like anyone
can mock a famous person,

1904
01:51:07,001 --> 01:51:09,100
but there was a famous person
mocks a regular person.

1905
01:51:09,280 --> 01:51:13,080
Like what if Kim Kardashians just went
to some girl's Instagram page and started

1906
01:51:13,081 --> 01:51:16,270
shitting on her and making youtube
videos better feet and like,

1907
01:51:16,271 --> 01:51:18,400
look how ugly you are. A
bitch. Look, you already baby.

1908
01:51:18,520 --> 01:51:22,000
People would freak the fuck out. But you
read this stuff that women write to her.

1909
01:51:22,020 --> 01:51:26,470
Yeah. They use their own Facebook profile.
They feel totally free to do this.

1910
01:51:26,471 --> 01:51:29,920
They're not worried. Oh my
gosh. Good to the mentions.

1911
01:51:29,950 --> 01:51:32,350
The mentions under a
Kim Kardashians tweet.

1912
01:51:32,380 --> 01:51:35,500
Any tweet Baru to Instagram.

1913
01:51:35,501 --> 01:51:37,600
There was an Instagram
of her with her daughter,

1914
01:51:37,601 --> 01:51:39,250
but she had cropped her
daughter's face out.

1915
01:51:39,280 --> 01:51:43,870
It was just her holding her daughter and
the fucking hate the people that just

1916
01:51:43,871 --> 01:51:45,580
hate it on her.
Lol.

1917
01:51:45,581 --> 01:51:49,480
Thank you for giving me another reason
to hate your fucking retarded stupid ass.

1918
01:51:49,780 --> 01:51:52,840
Like just saying that evil shit.
Why'd you crop your daughter out?

1919
01:51:52,841 --> 01:51:55,690
You fucking skanky bitch and
like all this like crazy.

1920
01:51:55,691 --> 01:51:59,140
It would be great by the way, if she
started making videos, making fun of me.

1921
01:51:59,440 --> 01:52:03,250
Just find someone focus on one of those
girls who said that one thing can make

1922
01:52:03,251 --> 01:52:08,200
and just open up each of
the bat. It just page. Yeah.

1923
01:52:08,380 --> 01:52:11,830
Let me pull up into a mansion in
her Bentley and go, come on inside.

1924
01:52:11,831 --> 01:52:14,690
I want to show you one of my favorite
people on the Internet and go to this girl

1925
01:52:15,360 --> 01:52:17,890
fucking shit on her. It'd
be hilarious. Go crazy.

1926
01:52:18,130 --> 01:52:22,300
People that would never defend her in
a million years would go crazy if she

1927
01:52:22,301 --> 01:52:26,230
attacked someone on the
Internet. Yeah. She's just
like, Amanda [inaudible]. I'm a,

1928
01:52:26,320 --> 01:52:29,230
I'm going to make a special video
just about you. You stupid bitch.

1929
01:52:29,530 --> 01:52:34,030
And then just laid her, oh my God. Public
support. But she's supposed to eat it.

1930
01:52:34,150 --> 01:52:38,290
She's supposed to eat it and say nothing
because she's famous and she's above.

1931
01:52:38,291 --> 01:52:40,870
She's like thought to be privileged.
Do you respond?

1932
01:52:40,900 --> 01:52:43,840
Do you have any reaction to
any more? It's a hatred. Ah,

1933
01:52:43,841 --> 01:52:47,390
it's not worth it most of the time. Yeah.
I just block them. Just block them, take,

1934
01:52:47,391 --> 01:52:51,170
ignore them or block them depending on
how egregious it is. If it's just super,

1935
01:52:51,171 --> 01:52:54,380
like sometimes you go to someone's Twitter
page and it's like all they've been

1936
01:52:54,381 --> 01:52:58,370
doing for the last, Haier is hating on
you and you didn't even know it until now.

1937
01:52:58,560 --> 01:53:03,110
And I almost feel like I have this feeling
where like part of me goes, you know,

1938
01:53:03,230 --> 01:53:06,430
I think they want the block. That's
all I can say. They could be,

1939
01:53:06,740 --> 01:53:11,540
I got black so I don't,
I go just no response is the best.

1940
01:53:11,780 --> 01:53:12,610
Like you don't even have,

1941
01:53:12,610 --> 01:53:16,010
but then they'll interact with
you again like you could, I get,

1942
01:53:16,011 --> 01:53:18,200
but if you don't respond at all,
it's just a one way interaction.

1943
01:53:18,380 --> 01:53:20,720
That's what it is most of
the time. Yeah. I, but I,

1944
01:53:20,760 --> 01:53:23,270
I definitely don't
respond if I do respond,

1945
01:53:23,930 --> 01:53:26,840
if by like someone might
think something incorrectly,

1946
01:53:26,841 --> 01:53:29,450
like the married be upset
at me for something and it's
like maybe they got wrong.

1947
01:53:29,690 --> 01:53:32,360
Like maybe I'll respond if I feel
like if I'm going to get correct,

1948
01:53:32,390 --> 01:53:34,070
but if they're shitty insulting,

1949
01:53:34,071 --> 01:53:36,690
like why would I bother you
choose who you communicate with.

1950
01:53:36,920 --> 01:53:39,740
I'm not shitting and insulting, you
know, if you come out of the gate,

1951
01:53:39,800 --> 01:53:43,370
like me personally, like I, if I, even if
I say something that you disagree with,

1952
01:53:43,730 --> 01:53:46,400
if you just start insulting
me like right off the bat,

1953
01:53:46,430 --> 01:53:48,380
well we're not communicating
because I don't even know you.

1954
01:53:48,580 --> 01:53:52,310
Like you might have a point, I might
listen to that point if you weren't a cut,

1955
01:53:52,670 --> 01:53:55,130
but if you just come right at
me with that, like why bother?

1956
01:53:55,131 --> 01:53:58,040
There's plenty of people in this world.
It's game over. There's a lot of people.

1957
01:53:58,130 --> 01:53:59,870
There's no need to like there's,

1958
01:53:59,900 --> 01:54:04,040
there's great criticism that you can
get from people that are thinking

1959
01:54:04,041 --> 01:54:06,470
thoughtful people and it
helps you form opinions.

1960
01:54:06,590 --> 01:54:08,840
There's a lot of smart people that
you don't know. You haven't met them.

1961
01:54:08,841 --> 01:54:10,340
They have a different point of view.
It's great.

1962
01:54:10,550 --> 01:54:11,990
It's one of the beautiful
things about the internet,

1963
01:54:12,500 --> 01:54:16,380
but the cons just don't bother. There's
not enough time. Not enough time. I agree.

1964
01:54:16,390 --> 01:54:19,880
I just can't. But that's something
you learn. You know, you learn from,

1965
01:54:19,980 --> 01:54:22,910
like I had this Guy John
Wayne par on the other day.

1966
01:54:22,911 --> 01:54:26,870
He's multiple time world boy Thai
champion, like super tough guy.

1967
01:54:26,871 --> 01:54:28,970
You would think this is the
kind of guy doesn't give a fuck.

1968
01:54:29,330 --> 01:54:31,100
He's like texting me. He's like, God,

1969
01:54:31,110 --> 01:54:35,330
these fucking assholes on Twitter and
youtube. I'm like, it's funny, I just,

1970
01:54:35,331 --> 01:54:39,680
people being mean talking shit about him.
Well somebody like that, probably the,

1971
01:54:39,681 --> 01:54:42,770
it's like as a comedian
you're used to rejection more.

1972
01:54:42,920 --> 01:54:46,340
And especially with the way
that social media developed,

1973
01:54:46,580 --> 01:54:50,510
you know like Youtube and Netflix,
there's,

1974
01:54:50,660 --> 01:54:53,690
there's a forum for people
to go, like you suck, right?

1975
01:54:53,690 --> 01:54:57,920
So after a while when you
see those they don't like,

1976
01:54:58,250 --> 01:55:00,980
they don't affect you as much.
You know, you build up a little,

1977
01:55:00,981 --> 01:55:02,360
a bit of a tolerance to it,

1978
01:55:02,600 --> 01:55:07,370
but I bet somebody that comes on your
show that maybe is accomplished and well

1979
01:55:07,371 --> 01:55:07,581
known,

1980
01:55:07,581 --> 01:55:10,850
but maybe it doesn't have a big social
media presence when they first get those,

1981
01:55:10,851 --> 01:55:14,840
you're the fucking dumbest person ever.
We'd be texting her like, what the fuck?

1982
01:55:14,870 --> 01:55:17,360
You know, the biggest one was
uh, well he was a pretty big,

1983
01:55:17,361 --> 01:55:19,730
John is a big one because first of all,
John Wayne Park,

1984
01:55:19,880 --> 01:55:24,260
although he's a multiple time world
Moitai champion, he's a really sweet guy.

1985
01:55:24,680 --> 01:55:27,500
Super Nice and he would
never be like that.

1986
01:55:27,501 --> 01:55:29,720
He would never like think of
like insulting someone like that.

1987
01:55:30,060 --> 01:55:32,730
Someone does it to him and he's like,
wow, what's going on? Yeah. Fuck.

1988
01:55:32,780 --> 01:55:35,570
Well was coming from, but
they, you know, they don't,

1989
01:55:35,600 --> 01:55:37,220
they don't get that experience that,

1990
01:55:37,250 --> 01:55:42,200
that weird public guy experience that
you get when you hit him with 1.5 million

1991
01:55:42,201 --> 01:55:46,270
Twitter followers. Like you tweet some
something like that and like they're like,

1992
01:55:46,470 --> 01:55:49,890
they feel that wave of people
and a certain amount of
them are just going to be

1993
01:55:49,900 --> 01:55:53,070
shitheads. Sure, sure. If you
have 100,000 people view a tweet,

1994
01:55:53,100 --> 01:55:55,920
which is very possible when you
got 1.5 million Twitter followers,

1995
01:55:56,220 --> 01:55:58,260
100,000 people looking at a tweet,
man,

1996
01:55:58,261 --> 01:56:02,010
you're going to get a few hundred
complete fuckheads. Yeah. You just gonna.

1997
01:56:02,210 --> 01:56:05,370
It's just like you pull a net, you're
going to get a certain type of fish.

1998
01:56:05,570 --> 01:56:08,250
You know,
if you a net across a mile of ocean,

1999
01:56:08,490 --> 01:56:11,610
you're going to get a cross section
of all the fish that are in the ocean.

2000
01:56:11,660 --> 01:56:16,520
Maybe a few dozen in that area.
You're going to get assholes.
Yeah, true, true, true.

2001
01:56:16,560 --> 01:56:19,710
But just don't interact with them.
It was like there's no point.

2002
01:56:19,890 --> 01:56:20,910
And if you're that person,

2003
01:56:21,120 --> 01:56:23,970
if you're a person who's just lashing
out at someone like that and insulting,

2004
01:56:24,030 --> 01:56:27,240
unless it's funny, some people are
pretty funny. Yeah. If they're funny,

2005
01:56:27,380 --> 01:56:29,370
they get a pass. If you're
funding, you get a pass.

2006
01:56:29,640 --> 01:56:32,310
But if you're just doing it to be funny,
if you're doing, if you're just rage,

2007
01:56:32,370 --> 01:56:36,720
like you always know that it's never
about what they're screaming about or

2008
01:56:36,721 --> 01:56:40,890
something that was going
on in that person's life to
to put that kind of energy

2009
01:56:40,891 --> 01:56:45,660
into just spewing venom at
people, you know? Well it's
an effective, first of all,

2010
01:56:45,750 --> 01:56:47,640
it might be effect.
You might think it's effective.

2011
01:56:47,641 --> 01:56:49,200
You see someone on a top of a pedestal.

2012
01:56:49,201 --> 01:56:53,340
I Kim Kardashians and like that fucking
bitch and her Gucci underwear and you

2013
01:56:53,341 --> 01:56:56,510
want to attack her. But she's
still her. Yeah, she's still her.

2014
01:56:56,520 --> 01:56:59,250
You're still you and all that energy
you spent hating on someone who doesn't

2015
01:56:59,251 --> 01:57:02,250
even know you're alive and could have
been spent on improving your own life.

2016
01:57:02,280 --> 01:57:04,980
Right. And do you feel you don't
feel better, you'd never feel better.

2017
01:57:05,190 --> 01:57:07,620
You don't could feel better if it
was funny though, if it was funny,

2018
01:57:08,850 --> 01:57:10,770
but if you're just just like,
I fucking hate you bitch.

2019
01:57:10,771 --> 01:57:12,720
You still be kind of like
all that stuff is like,

2020
01:57:12,880 --> 01:57:16,680
oh well it's just people that don't
understand what's going on and one day all

2021
01:57:16,681 --> 01:57:18,060
that shit is going to come out.

2022
01:57:18,450 --> 01:57:20,970
Like there's gonna come a point in time
where you're not gonna be able to do

2023
01:57:20,971 --> 01:57:21,211
that.

2024
01:57:21,211 --> 01:57:25,220
It's not going to be as easy as just like
attacking someone anonymously or it's

2025
01:57:25,221 --> 01:57:28,590
like you're going to be exposed for like
the stuff that you're running or who

2026
01:57:28,591 --> 01:57:31,530
you are, what your presence is. You know,

2027
01:57:32,400 --> 01:57:33,990
the weird thing is like kids today,

2028
01:57:34,200 --> 01:57:36,830
they're also going to be
responsible for things. You know?

2029
01:57:36,840 --> 01:57:40,500
Like maybe if a kid today is 21 and they
got some crazy Instagram page and then

2030
01:57:40,560 --> 01:57:44,580
going fucking buck wild and then one
day they're 27 28 and they have a

2031
01:57:44,581 --> 01:57:47,760
respectable job and they've got their
shit together and they've moved on with

2032
01:57:47,761 --> 01:57:51,260
their life about this out fucking
Internet, man, these it hadn't.

2033
01:57:51,270 --> 01:57:54,310
Pictures are still out. It happens now.
Why do you have underwear on your head?

2034
01:57:54,390 --> 01:57:57,160
Yeah. You're going to be the CEO of this
company. You've got a picture with you.

2035
01:57:57,420 --> 01:57:59,070
You're drunk.
If underwear over your head,

2036
01:57:59,100 --> 01:58:02,210
it's your friend blowing you or is he
pretending to blow you pretending to blow

2037
01:58:02,211 --> 01:58:06,000
it? The photos are less of an
issue for people than the comments.

2038
01:58:06,330 --> 01:58:08,900
Like if you write some
shit, I mean shit. Oh yeah.

2039
01:58:08,910 --> 01:58:11,580
There's been cops that like have a,
you know,

2040
01:58:12,150 --> 01:58:14,850
they have their online alias and then
somebody finds out and they're like,

2041
01:58:14,851 --> 01:58:18,030
look what this guy has been commenting on
things and then that's it. You're done.

2042
01:58:18,120 --> 01:58:22,830
Did you see the guy who has zero zero
criminal record and he's facing a

2043
01:58:22,831 --> 01:58:27,831
potential life imprisonment for
flashing gang signs on social media?

2044
01:58:29,460 --> 01:58:34,080
Pull that up Jim. Oh yeah,
it is fucking bizarre.

2045
01:58:34,260 --> 01:58:36,990
Like 2015 in America,

2046
01:58:37,200 --> 01:58:40,950
there was a guy with no criminal record.
Nothing. He hasn't done anything.

2047
01:58:41,380 --> 01:58:44,110
They arrest him for
throwing gang signs up.

2048
01:58:44,350 --> 01:58:48,640
What did they say that he's
affiliated with south? Uh,

2049
01:58:48,760 --> 01:58:53,760
I feel like that's like of this San Diego
man with no criminal record faces life

2050
01:58:54,430 --> 01:58:58,210
in prison for flashing
gang signs on Facebook.

2051
01:58:59,110 --> 01:59:02,710
How old is this gentleman? First of all,
let's, let's look at that right there.

2052
01:59:06,110 --> 01:59:07,670
Harvey and the rapper.

2053
01:59:08,240 --> 01:59:11,150
His name is Aaron Harvey and
14 other men including rapper,

2054
01:59:11,151 --> 01:59:15,680
tiny do were charged under an obscure
California law accusing them of conspiring

2055
01:59:15,681 --> 01:59:20,450
with gang members who shot nine
people in 2013 to early 2014.

2056
01:59:20,480 --> 01:59:25,220
What the fuck?
Find out how old that gentleman is.

2057
01:59:25,700 --> 01:59:28,880
I mean, you're hanging out with your
friends and they're throwing gang signs.

2058
01:59:28,881 --> 01:59:31,820
You don't want to get beat up.
You might throw a gang sign up to for it.

2059
01:59:31,880 --> 01:59:34,520
That's completely ridiculous,
man. What is the video down there?

2060
01:59:35,360 --> 01:59:40,060
What does that say?
Let's hear what he says.

2061
01:59:42,660 --> 01:59:46,080
How could we stop?
Um,

2062
01:59:47,180 --> 01:59:49,450
me and my family have been
living in the southeast

2063
01:59:52,110 --> 01:59:54,890
since the mid field.
Um,

2064
01:59:56,450 --> 01:59:59,460
I've had most of the jobs,
no criminal record.

2065
02:00:00,280 --> 02:00:05,280
Both the police continues to be spotless
weather and it's not specifically on

2066
02:00:05,671 --> 02:00:08,280
driving. I understand you guys
have the number though. Driving.

2067
02:00:08,450 --> 02:00:11,090
The majority of stops happen
when people are either a,

2068
02:00:11,150 --> 02:00:14,470
her parent's house or a
friend's house or wall walk.

2069
02:00:15,140 --> 02:00:19,170
So I believe I've been stopped just
off the top of my head since I was 14.

2070
02:00:19,171 --> 02:00:23,700
I'm 26 now. 50 something times that's
Korean. I do not have a criminal record.

2071
02:00:24,060 --> 02:00:27,840
I believe only one citation
was ever given you. He said,

2072
02:00:27,841 --> 02:00:31,730
I did turn on my blinker
within a hundred feet. Turn

2073
02:00:34,650 --> 02:00:38,640
one of these stuffs, uh, was in
front of my grandmother's house.

2074
02:00:38,760 --> 02:00:42,690
Police officers driving by any waves.
I waved back not doing anything.

2075
02:00:43,170 --> 02:00:47,010
I'm on my property. He pulls up
immediately. I'm putting handcuffs.

2076
02:00:47,910 --> 02:00:50,460
I don't know why I'm asking
you why. You know, why?

2077
02:00:50,760 --> 02:00:51,960
Why are you guys with my property?

2078
02:00:51,961 --> 02:00:56,520
He tells me if the middlemen come
on your property without permission.

2079
02:00:56,521 --> 02:00:58,860
So can we.
They go in my wallet.

2080
02:00:58,861 --> 02:01:01,260
They find that I'm a trained
emergency medical technician.

2081
02:01:02,780 --> 02:01:07,410
The sergeant tells me,
Oh wow, no you, you,

2082
02:01:07,850 --> 02:01:09,480
you're working to close to us.

2083
02:01:11,310 --> 02:01:14,070
We're going to have to do
something about this. Immediately.

2084
02:01:14,100 --> 02:01:15,750
I knew to stay in Las Vegas,

2085
02:01:15,751 --> 02:01:20,460
I mean fear and our communities living
in fear of the police because of these

2086
02:01:20,461 --> 02:01:24,570
things. And because of these numerous
stops of no crime has been committed,

2087
02:01:25,050 --> 02:01:29,100
just mirror stops of being in front of
my grandma's house, my parents' house,

2088
02:01:29,101 --> 02:01:30,540
or just hanging out.

2089
02:01:31,380 --> 02:01:34,180
And police have falsely
documented as a gang member.

2090
02:01:35,160 --> 02:01:38,670
And because I'm documented as a gang
because San Diego police department,

2091
02:01:39,020 --> 02:01:43,910
now I'm a liable or eligible
of this proposition.

2092
02:01:43,970 --> 02:01:48,970
Law Is in 21 penal code one a 2.5 and
right now I'm facing life in prison

2093
02:01:51,390 --> 02:01:54,920
with no knowledge of these crimes
being committed or anything.

2094
02:01:55,460 --> 02:01:59,210
So I believe that the problem is it,

2095
02:01:59,360 --> 02:02:03,410
is it the profile and when
you're pulled over while driving,

2096
02:02:04,190 --> 02:02:07,460
the police will say, well, why
am I being pulled over? Well,

2097
02:02:07,640 --> 02:02:10,160
I'll tell you when to me,
but get out the car.

2098
02:02:10,880 --> 02:02:11,750
Well,
there you go.

2099
02:02:12,050 --> 02:02:16,130
I think I believed him and I think you
need to use his voice for Tom or black.

2100
02:02:18,110 --> 02:02:22,670
She thinks it would be a good one for you.
Wow. Did you, did you see, there it goes.

2101
02:02:22,690 --> 02:02:26,930
All my black jokes now. Thanks for
depressing us. Um, did you see the,

2102
02:02:26,931 --> 02:02:31,320
the Department of Justice Report on
Ferguson? Well, where they say, oh dude,

2103
02:02:31,400 --> 02:02:36,170
you got to see this really pull it up
after the Michael Brown shooting and you

2104
02:02:36,171 --> 02:02:40,840
know, there was no indictment of police
officer Darren Wilson, the, you know, um,

2105
02:02:41,180 --> 02:02:42,650
attorney general went down and said,

2106
02:02:42,651 --> 02:02:44,930
we're going to investigate what
happens going to take a little while.

2107
02:02:45,170 --> 02:02:45,640
So they really,

2108
02:02:45,640 --> 02:02:50,640
they have a department of Justice
investigated and they found just so much

2109
02:02:51,230 --> 02:02:55,610
racism in that department. Like
the stats are alarming. It's like,

2110
02:02:55,940 --> 02:03:00,410
you know, 67% of the population
is black, but like arrests,

2111
02:03:00,710 --> 02:03:05,480
88% of the time are black. Um, and
the comparison to the white stats,

2112
02:03:05,510 --> 02:03:07,700
it's, it's, it's a statistically,

2113
02:03:07,701 --> 02:03:11,060
it's one of the most damning
reports you'll ever see.

2114
02:03:11,090 --> 02:03:14,180
Does it take into account white
people just being awesome? It doesn't,

2115
02:03:14,300 --> 02:03:18,890
but I like smiles. It takes him
to how awesome our smiles are.

2116
02:03:20,210 --> 02:03:23,190
But there's less contrast with our teeth
or they're not as dramatic. It's, yeah,

2117
02:03:23,191 --> 02:03:27,740
exactly. We don't get enough credit
for our smiles and all right. Uh,

2118
02:03:28,460 --> 02:03:32,990
dude. Like how, how often, um,
black people who were arrested,

2119
02:03:32,991 --> 02:03:35,090
they were going to look at this report,

2120
02:03:35,091 --> 02:03:39,470
detailed out Ferguson operated
at a vertically integrated
system from street cop

2121
02:03:39,471 --> 02:03:44,120
to court clerk to judge to
city administrator to city
council to raise revenue

2122
02:03:44,121 --> 02:03:48,130
for the city budget through increased
ticketing and finding, whoa.

2123
02:03:48,740 --> 02:03:53,540
But the dude, the stats are the
craziest, like, um, like all,

2124
02:03:54,110 --> 02:03:58,790
all the fucking arrests, uh, or black
people were at a such a disproportionate,

2125
02:03:59,240 --> 02:04:00,660
you know, disadvantage. Um,

2126
02:04:00,800 --> 02:04:05,060
as far as like how often they were
arrested when they were not doing anything

2127
02:04:05,061 --> 02:04:08,240
and like,
no contraband walking down the street.

2128
02:04:08,241 --> 02:04:13,160
Like that guy said versus like,
um, the white a white person was,

2129
02:04:13,310 --> 02:04:17,570
it's not even comparable really.
Uh, how often force was used, like,

2130
02:04:18,050 --> 02:04:23,000
you know, 10 to one black to white. Like
it's crazy stats every time a, um, uh,

2131
02:04:23,330 --> 02:04:23,660
uh,

2132
02:04:23,660 --> 02:04:28,660
a dog has bitten a person in Ferguson
and since the report was put together all

2133
02:04:29,180 --> 02:04:33,750
at 100% black, like all, all that,
it's, it's just so blatant. It's,

2134
02:04:33,760 --> 02:04:37,410
it's to be fair that the whole town
is pretty much black though. Well,

2135
02:04:37,411 --> 02:04:38,880
I think they said it was 67%.

2136
02:04:38,910 --> 02:04:42,680
Right? Um, well there's, there's
a good a New York Post, uh,

2137
02:04:42,750 --> 02:04:46,010
a report on it where they pretty
much went through it and, uh,

2138
02:04:46,140 --> 02:04:50,400
pretty much that that's why this is
this not as racist as you think. Well,

2139
02:04:50,401 --> 02:04:53,680
you know what? Quit crying then. I,

2140
02:04:55,300 --> 02:05:00,060
I mean, I'm sure it is, but, well, we've
talked about this a hundred times before.

2141
02:05:00,090 --> 02:05:02,580
If you're in a bad neighborhood,
you grew up in a bad neighborhood,

2142
02:05:02,581 --> 02:05:05,840
you have families that had
been involved in crime. It's a,

2143
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:08,490
it's a system that you're
stuck in your story,

2144
02:05:08,540 --> 02:05:11,550
whether it's some sort
of grand conspiracy,

2145
02:05:11,551 --> 02:05:16,551
which some people claim or just some
inescapable sort of momentous thing where

2146
02:05:17,221 --> 02:05:20,340
you've got momentum on your side
or against you rather, you know,

2147
02:05:20,370 --> 02:05:24,990
momentum of your, your family, your
neighborhood, the kids you grew up with,

2148
02:05:25,200 --> 02:05:28,590
all these people involved in crime,
that momentum is very,

2149
02:05:28,591 --> 02:05:32,520
very difficult to break.
It's very difficult to get a fresh start.

2150
02:05:32,670 --> 02:05:37,670
So thinking that anyone who grows up in
those environments should have to behave

2151
02:05:38,851 --> 02:05:43,230
exactly the same way without
any consideration for how
they've been developed

2152
02:05:43,231 --> 02:05:47,040
and grown up in comparison to a guy
like Tommy bonds who had it light.

2153
02:05:47,270 --> 02:05:50,400
I'm walking around in Florida would
fucking shorts on what I'm saying.

2154
02:05:50,550 --> 02:05:53,850
Sandals too. Did you, uh,
sometimes what those feet fly,

2155
02:05:54,270 --> 02:05:56,520
do you want to hear some of these stats?
Sure. They're pretty crazy. All right.

2156
02:05:56,580 --> 02:05:59,010
Despite making up 67% of the population,

2157
02:05:59,400 --> 02:06:02,490
African Americans accounted
for 85% of traffic stops.

2158
02:06:02,820 --> 02:06:06,000
90% of citations.
So that goes back to the money thing.

2159
02:06:06,480 --> 02:06:11,480
And 93% of Ferguson Police
Department rests from 2012 to 2014.

2160
02:06:12,210 --> 02:06:13,043
That's what I mean.

2161
02:06:14,410 --> 02:06:18,780
I occasionally arrest a white person
just for goof of African Americans,

2162
02:06:18,781 --> 02:06:23,160
2.7 times 2.07 times more likely to
be searched during a vehicular stop,

2163
02:06:23,460 --> 02:06:27,630
but our 26% less likely to
have contraband found on them.

2164
02:06:27,720 --> 02:06:28,553
Look at this.

2165
02:06:28,610 --> 02:06:32,850
The statistics don't prove racism because
blacks don't commit traffic offenses

2166
02:06:32,851 --> 02:06:35,460
at the same rate as
other population groups.

2167
02:06:36,570 --> 02:06:38,130
It's pretty instant what
they're trying to say.

2168
02:06:38,131 --> 02:06:41,430
That's a really nice way of saying
black people caused more crime.

2169
02:06:41,730 --> 02:06:42,630
That's what they're saying,

2170
02:06:42,980 --> 02:06:46,170
but they're saying it doesn't prove racism
because black people just caused more

2171
02:06:46,171 --> 02:06:47,220
crime.
That's what they're saying.

2172
02:06:47,760 --> 02:06:51,690
Blacks were 31% more likely than whites
to be pulled over for a traffic stop

2173
02:06:53,250 --> 02:06:56,470
nationwide. Nationwide, it's pretty, uh,

2174
02:06:56,520 --> 02:06:58,590
so first and being a
black majority of town,

2175
02:06:58,591 --> 02:07:01,020
if it's blacks are pulled over the
same rate as blacks nationally,

2176
02:07:01,200 --> 02:07:04,200
that account for 87.5% of
the traffic stops this,

2177
02:07:04,201 --> 02:07:06,390
so it's racist even by that standard.

2178
02:07:06,420 --> 02:07:11,420
This one's pretty a amazing African
Americans account for 95% of manner of

2179
02:07:12,121 --> 02:07:16,650
walking charges, manner
of walking. Hold on.

2180
02:07:16,860 --> 02:07:18,750
There's a manner of walking charge.

2181
02:07:18,870 --> 02:07:22,320
94% of all fail to comply charges.

2182
02:07:22,620 --> 02:07:25,020
92% of resisting arrest,

2183
02:07:25,260 --> 02:07:30,180
92% of peace disturbance
and 89% of failure to obey.

2184
02:07:30,300 --> 02:07:34,290
What about pimp Strutton?
99.9% really a law.

2185
02:07:34,291 --> 02:07:37,210
You're not allowed to walk a certain way,
man of minor of walking.

2186
02:07:37,211 --> 02:07:41,020
I think that's like falls into like that
Jay walking stuff like, oh, that's like,

2187
02:07:41,021 --> 02:07:44,910
come on man. Manner of walking in your
calling, something manner of walking.

2188
02:07:44,911 --> 02:07:47,230
I don't like the way you lean to the left.
How about you?

2189
02:07:47,231 --> 02:07:51,940
Be a little more fucking specific manner
of walking charges. That's pretty crazy.

2190
02:07:52,450 --> 02:07:54,550
Jamie.
Google manner of walking charges.

2191
02:07:54,551 --> 02:07:56,940
Tell us what manner of
walking charges and tail.

2192
02:07:58,300 --> 02:08:00,090
Even jaywalking is fucking goofy.

2193
02:08:01,720 --> 02:08:05,390
They bag people in Hollywood for Jay
walking all the time. I've seen it. Yeah.

2194
02:08:05,590 --> 02:08:08,560
People Cross sunset.
They're trying to keep people from dying.

2195
02:08:09,220 --> 02:08:12,280
All this texting assholes
out here. They're already
going up on sidewalks there.

2196
02:08:12,281 --> 02:08:14,640
Yeah, they could just,
you know what they can do?

2197
02:08:14,650 --> 02:08:17,770
They could just send sugar around and
make sure people don't Jaywalk and I don't

2198
02:08:17,771 --> 02:08:19,720
think he's around right now.
I think he's busy in jail.

2199
02:08:19,810 --> 02:08:23,590
He was pretty big after that video.
He's pretty fucked though, right?

2200
02:08:23,950 --> 02:08:25,600
Wouldn't you assume?
Yeah. That's pretty bad.

2201
02:08:25,840 --> 02:08:29,500
But maybe not if they could
prove that guy had a gun. Yeah.

2202
02:08:29,530 --> 02:08:33,490
It'd be funny if they pull the, um,
uh, the gap, one of the gas pedals.

2203
02:08:33,850 --> 02:08:34,660
There's a thing.

2204
02:08:34,660 --> 02:08:37,270
I don't think you were saying that and
he said he really didn't know that he was

2205
02:08:37,280 --> 02:08:41,290
very fortunate. He says in fear of his
life, right? Yeah. He might've been. Yeah.

2206
02:08:41,340 --> 02:08:43,480
I don't, I don't, I don't
know, man. I think that's,

2207
02:08:43,690 --> 02:08:47,200
that's probably gonna now if Robert
Durst had been driving that truck,

2208
02:08:48,010 --> 02:08:49,180
that'd be something innocuous.

2209
02:08:49,181 --> 02:08:53,470
Municipal Principal Code Municipal Code
requires pedestrians to walk on the

2210
02:08:53,471 --> 02:08:56,560
sidewalks or close to the side
of the road whenever possible.

2211
02:08:56,950 --> 02:08:59,440
It's intent is to make sure
people don't block a road.

2212
02:08:59,680 --> 02:09:01,090
But according to a federal port,

2213
02:09:01,091 --> 02:09:05,710
police have routinely used the law for
another purpose too fine and harassed.

2214
02:09:05,830 --> 02:09:10,310
Blacks. I don't like how they wrote
blacks. How about black people? I can't,

2215
02:09:10,330 --> 02:09:11,860
they're not black.
They're black people.

2216
02:09:12,220 --> 02:09:17,220
African Americans accounted for 95% of
manner of walking among along roadway

2217
02:09:17,651 --> 02:09:22,651
charges from 2011 to 2013 95% wow.

2218
02:09:22,990 --> 02:09:26,230
And that's nationwide.
Converses Fergus, Fergus,

2219
02:09:26,231 --> 02:09:29,830
they called it walking
black walking black.

2220
02:09:29,831 --> 02:09:32,860
You would leave out of your house to go
to the store and you might not make it

2221
02:09:32,861 --> 02:09:36,130
back. Wow. Wow. Fucked up place.

2222
02:09:36,520 --> 02:09:40,540
They stalk you and stop you. He said,
they will say, Hey, what's your name?

2223
02:09:40,570 --> 02:09:44,020
Got Any warrants. Why he's strolling
through the neighborhood. Come here.

2224
02:09:44,260 --> 02:09:47,170
You look suspicious. What
the fuck man. See that.

2225
02:09:47,200 --> 02:09:51,850
That is just crazy that they and that
they actually somehow or another that

2226
02:09:51,851 --> 02:09:55,960
fuels the system and that by finding
people and arresting people and all that,

2227
02:09:55,961 --> 02:09:58,750
it's somehow another fuels the system.
That's slavery.

2228
02:09:58,890 --> 02:10:02,200
I mean that's the Lee really is
a style of slavery. These stats.

2229
02:10:02,201 --> 02:10:05,650
I mean I think they'd probably have to
feel black people in Ferguson probably

2230
02:10:05,651 --> 02:10:07,710
just feel it feel really validated after,

2231
02:10:08,200 --> 02:10:11,380
after all the marching and then people and
being like, and people, cause you know,

2232
02:10:11,381 --> 02:10:15,590
people were like, come on, this is, we're
just whining. This is not whining. No,

2233
02:10:15,880 --> 02:10:20,080
94% of all failure to comply
charges were filed against blacks.

2234
02:10:20,440 --> 02:10:24,430
The whole thing of walking down the
road and people pull up and start asking

2235
02:10:24,431 --> 02:10:28,030
questions like that, unless you're doing
something wrong, leave me the fuck alone.

2236
02:10:28,031 --> 02:10:32,230
Of course, that's what America's all
about. That we do get left alone. Yeah,

2237
02:10:32,260 --> 02:10:34,010
we do get left on and
that's what it should

2238
02:10:34,010 --> 02:10:36,890
be. Right. That happened to
me the other day though. I

2239
02:10:38,660 --> 02:10:41,470
kind of look at you dude.
What happened?

2240
02:10:41,490 --> 02:10:45,590
Agon you sag at least just made like
came on like I was getting out of my car

2241
02:10:46,010 --> 02:10:49,220
and uh, pops like, what are
you doing man? I'm like, uh,

2242
02:10:49,250 --> 02:10:52,160
getting into going into my house,
had my book bag and he goes,

2243
02:10:52,190 --> 02:10:55,610
let me see your id and like,
why are you on at my house right now?

2244
02:10:55,640 --> 02:10:59,900
And he made me like show him and his
license and stuff and, and it was all my,

2245
02:10:59,901 --> 02:11:02,120
he was just like, you just look
weird man. You have a book bag.

2246
02:11:02,121 --> 02:11:04,820
You're going into your house,
you're not two in the morning.

2247
02:11:05,440 --> 02:11:08,360
And then I filmed the whole thing.
I just took out my phone and just go,

2248
02:11:08,361 --> 02:11:12,910
why are you, why are you at making
it? This is like months ago. It's, no,

2249
02:11:12,920 --> 02:11:14,390
it's at home.
I could find it for you.

2250
02:11:14,391 --> 02:11:18,050
I just don't want to start a
fight with the Glendale birdies.

2251
02:11:18,430 --> 02:11:19,580
Ari and I have to ask you,

2252
02:11:19,581 --> 02:11:24,110
is it okay if I upload the video of you
two arguing about American sniper? Yeah,

2253
02:11:24,111 --> 02:11:27,950
of course. Of course. I just had, I don't
want to be rude. Oh, that's nice of you.

2254
02:11:28,220 --> 02:11:30,110
I don't get it for you,
but not good for Ari.

2255
02:11:30,200 --> 02:11:34,190
America is going to be very upset at
his lack of patriotism and his, look,

2256
02:11:34,250 --> 02:11:38,360
let's just put it this way because
here's the truth.

2257
02:11:39,710 --> 02:11:41,270
Shrew fest has side effects.

2258
02:11:45,260 --> 02:11:48,080
Good Ole Ari.
I'll do my impression of art.

2259
02:11:53,330 --> 02:11:57,410
Those are going to war.
They're like my favorite.

2260
02:11:59,430 --> 02:12:04,170
Let's go to war. What are you talking
about? And then he goes, uh, yeah,

2261
02:12:04,171 --> 02:12:08,310
like he goes, yeah, Bradley Cooper did
like a good impression of of the guy.

2262
02:12:08,311 --> 02:12:12,090
And I'm like, well that's the fucking
Gig asshole. Like if you're an actor,

2263
02:12:12,091 --> 02:12:14,540
it's like, can you do a good
impression? And like he's like

2264
02:12:19,100 --> 02:12:23,410
getting shot was actually a good choice.
17 minutes movie.

2265
02:12:24,470 --> 02:12:27,390
He was killed that day in writing.
Listen, you communists fuck

2266
02:12:30,470 --> 02:12:34,880
duty. They show his whole training, 40
minute training. Same thing for no reason.

2267
02:12:35,510 --> 02:12:36,920
Straining for fucking 40 minutes.

2268
02:12:36,921 --> 02:12:41,210
No reason to training because you're
seeing how hard it is to become a seal.

2269
02:12:41,211 --> 02:12:44,270
You mean? No reason. That's a different
story. It's a different story.

2270
02:12:44,271 --> 02:12:47,690
It's his story. It's a character
study. You didn't, you didn't think it.

2271
02:12:47,691 --> 02:12:48,530
We didn't feel it at all.

2272
02:12:48,560 --> 02:12:50,850
There was not a moment where I was
like lost and it was like, wow,

2273
02:12:50,851 --> 02:12:54,380
you're really feel on top of being back
home now. All contrived. You see him,

2274
02:12:55,320 --> 02:12:59,660
he has PTSD. He was defending
me. It's actually resigned. Yeah,

2275
02:12:59,840 --> 02:13:01,060
because you have a black eye.

2276
02:13:06,650 --> 02:13:07,483
Of course.

2277
02:13:08,210 --> 02:13:13,210
It was so fun to be there that
night that you think that night.

2278
02:13:13,800 --> 02:13:15,000
Yeah. That night, by the way,

2279
02:13:15,750 --> 02:13:20,450
I that was you miss pat.
Ms Pat was hand,

2280
02:13:20,490 --> 02:13:24,370
but she was hanging Joe on stage.
Joe [inaudible],

2281
02:13:24,930 --> 02:13:28,520
Ari and myself. That was one of the most
fun lineups I've ever been a part of.

2282
02:13:28,530 --> 02:13:32,520
It was murderous. That was pretty,
pretty murderous. That was worn

2283
02:13:32,520 --> 02:13:34,680
to the ground. By the time when
the people left out of there,

2284
02:13:34,681 --> 02:13:38,220
they were like wiping your forehead
25 minutes set so longer. It wasn't,

2285
02:13:38,221 --> 02:13:42,730
everybody did 25 minutes. Pretty crazy
show. Yeah, it was chaos, man. They,

2286
02:13:42,960 --> 02:13:43,800
they're beautiful.

2287
02:13:44,210 --> 02:13:47,770
Place is the best. And we're on
Ari show, uh, this Thursday night.

2288
02:13:47,771 --> 02:13:52,020
It's Thursday and I are in the same
episode. Christella Alonzo. Um,

2289
02:13:52,070 --> 02:13:56,540
we each tell a a story on our Recia fears.
This is not happening.

2290
02:13:56,600 --> 02:14:00,830
12:30 AM Thursday night.
Don't like look for it.

2291
02:14:00,831 --> 02:14:04,850
Wednesday at 12:30 AM don't be an asshole.
You know what I'm talking about?

2292
02:14:04,851 --> 02:14:08,600
You're up on Thursday. You stay
at your out clause. 12:30 AM

2293
02:14:10,900 --> 02:14:14,040
you should shut the fuck up and
understand how America works. Fun.

2294
02:14:14,240 --> 02:14:16,940
12:30 AM I'm awake, bitch. It's
four o'clock in the morning.

2295
02:14:17,060 --> 02:14:19,930
It's not four o'clock in the morning. The
next day, four o'clock in the morning,

2296
02:14:19,950 --> 02:14:23,090
Saturday night. You know why it's Saturday
night? Cause I'm still out. I'm out.

2297
02:14:23,420 --> 02:14:27,290
I'm out. This is fucking Saturday night
midday for me buddy. Yeah, that's a,

2298
02:14:27,291 --> 02:14:28,370
that's a Thursday night.

2299
02:14:28,740 --> 02:14:29,910
I don't know if I,
I haven't seen it.

2300
02:14:29,911 --> 02:14:34,911
So I'm excited to see whether I
did that taping for this episode.

2301
02:14:36,420 --> 02:14:40,860
The day I got back from
Hong Kong or like the night.

2302
02:14:41,370 --> 02:14:45,180
So I am on like I fell asleep in
the green room. They're sitting up

2303
02:14:47,040 --> 02:14:50,260
and somebody was like, hey man. And
I stood up and I started to, to like,

2304
02:14:50,370 --> 02:14:54,940
I was so jet lagged crazy, but I still
had a blast. It was, you know, it was,

2305
02:14:54,941 --> 02:14:57,660
those crowds are amazing.
Yeah. And his new special,

2306
02:14:57,661 --> 02:15:00,880
which is not as new specialist
that she was last special, uh,

2307
02:15:00,960 --> 02:15:05,790
heirs this Friday night too. Um, that's
uh, that's what's that one called?

2308
02:15:05,830 --> 02:15:07,950
That's called a passive aggressive,
passive aggressive. Yeah.

2309
02:15:08,070 --> 02:15:11,040
Passive aggressive airs. Friday you
could still get his other special,

2310
02:15:11,041 --> 02:15:14,040
which is fucking awesome,
which is called paid regular,

2311
02:15:14,280 --> 02:15:17,960
which you could get that one on comedy
central direct. And you could also,

2312
02:15:18,260 --> 02:15:22,150
it airs occasionally. You know, they
replay those things sometimes. So, uh,

2313
02:15:22,200 --> 02:15:25,470
check your local listings.
You fucks. Yeah. Fuck faces.

2314
02:15:27,930 --> 02:15:31,680
Ari's balling out of control. I had them
on yesterday. He's so confident now.

2315
02:15:31,681 --> 02:15:34,710
It's hilarious. It's great. Huh?
He's a different guy. It's so weird.

2316
02:15:34,711 --> 02:15:38,360
I was going up that hill where a
pink.is and he isn't that billboard.

2317
02:15:38,370 --> 02:15:39,060
That's right.
If it,

2318
02:15:39,060 --> 02:15:42,180
but like I was in traffic and I'm just
like looking up and it's suddenly see

2319
02:15:42,210 --> 02:15:44,730
just Ari's eyes poke up from the,
uh,

2320
02:15:44,790 --> 02:15:48,360
the hill when you're driving up that
hill because the billboard. Yeah,

2321
02:15:48,361 --> 02:15:52,260
just see Ariz face on crazy. So
he's super confident now, Huh?

2322
02:15:52,320 --> 02:15:53,430
He's balling out of control.

2323
02:15:53,880 --> 02:15:57,930
He was on a podcast yesterday shitting
on Howard stern telling him and Clint

2324
02:15:57,930 --> 02:16:01,120
Eastwood go suck. They're old, old
man. Dick Stuck. Shut her off hard.

2325
02:16:01,160 --> 02:16:05,580
Just did it again. He just bashes
podcasts. Look on those every episode now.

2326
02:16:06,510 --> 02:16:09,060
Podcasts when I was six years
old and I was like, yeah,

2327
02:16:09,061 --> 02:16:12,360
it's called you had a tape recorder,
Howard, chill the fuck out. Well, why?

2328
02:16:12,361 --> 02:16:13,194
As I said to,

2329
02:16:13,710 --> 02:16:17,070
I don't have any problem with them saying
that because it doesn't make any sense

2330
02:16:17,100 --> 02:16:20,040
and I feel like he's baiting
people to talk about his was his

2331
02:16:20,490 --> 02:16:22,730
thing is play that
people didn't know when,

2332
02:16:22,940 --> 02:16:26,640
how he dominated radio was that
when he was introduced to a market,

2333
02:16:27,060 --> 02:16:30,520
the first thing he did was shit.
The number one local show.

2334
02:16:30,850 --> 02:16:34,420
Like he would shit on that show and
then that the people that listen to that

2335
02:16:34,421 --> 02:16:37,270
show would find out,
they would end up checking out his show.

2336
02:16:37,930 --> 02:16:42,320
He Baits people this way. He, I think
every, almost everything he does is calc.

2337
02:16:42,360 --> 02:16:43,510
What's that?
Do you think this though?

2338
02:16:43,511 --> 02:16:45,520
Is that or do you think this
is just having an old man,

2339
02:16:45,521 --> 02:16:48,700
but I think you can say that part of it.
I think it's part of it may.

2340
02:16:48,720 --> 02:16:50,230
He's genuinely, he's like, that's stupid.

2341
02:16:50,320 --> 02:16:54,010
The other part is he knows that podcasts
are getting big, make fun of podcasts,

2342
02:16:54,011 --> 02:16:57,550
make them come listen to the show. He,
it's not like the guy's a brilliant,

2343
02:16:58,410 --> 02:17:00,570
that's what I've been saying.
Give me some knuckles dog a bit.

2344
02:17:00,580 --> 02:17:04,120
I'll like fucking American sniper
where I see it too. For sure.

2345
02:17:04,360 --> 02:17:07,390
You're not going to like that
movie? No. Why? I haven't seen it,

2346
02:17:07,391 --> 02:17:09,520
but everyone tells me it's
like the shittiest movie ever.

2347
02:17:09,521 --> 02:17:11,630
You're like the first
person about everyone.

2348
02:17:11,830 --> 02:17:13,330
I've talked to quite a
few people that liked it.

2349
02:17:13,420 --> 02:17:17,110
It's not the shittiest movie ever. I don't
understand like what should go see it.

2350
02:17:17,140 --> 02:17:19,510
If you seen it, I will still go see
it together. I can see it together.

2351
02:17:19,720 --> 02:17:22,120
I see it together. We'll make
a report. Okay. It's you know,

2352
02:17:22,160 --> 02:17:24,670
equal c together before and
we'll do a podcast at night.

2353
02:17:24,671 --> 02:17:26,980
We'll see it in there during the day
and we'll come in. Definitely can see,

2354
02:17:27,350 --> 02:17:29,830
you know, people saying I like to
move at all for any movie. Right.

2355
02:17:29,950 --> 02:17:33,520
I liked that movie. I don't
want that movie. Sure. Like
that. It's a piece of shit,

2356
02:17:33,700 --> 02:17:37,480
not a fucking chance. If you think it's
a piece of shit, you're fucking retarded.

2357
02:17:37,890 --> 02:17:41,650
Like that's something is wrong with
you. If you go, that's a piece of shit,

2358
02:17:41,651 --> 02:17:44,980
garbage movie. It's, it's ridiculous.
It's sick, man. It's a quality film.

2359
02:17:44,981 --> 02:17:49,090
I didn't see it. It's a quality,
uh, snipers up quality for,

2360
02:17:49,100 --> 02:17:51,970
I could see you not liking different
things about it. You can be like,

2361
02:17:52,150 --> 02:17:56,950
I'm against war, I'm against, you know,
military, all that stuff. Absolutely.

2362
02:17:56,980 --> 02:17:59,440
But to be, and you can even say like,
I don't like it, but to be like,

2363
02:17:59,680 --> 02:18:02,140
that's a piece of garbage movie.
It's ridiculous.

2364
02:18:02,141 --> 02:18:03,880
What do you think was
better that a lone survivor?

2365
02:18:04,180 --> 02:18:05,050
I didn't see either one of them.

2366
02:18:06,310 --> 02:18:11,310
I think lone survivor was pretty fucking
fantastically done as far as the wars

2367
02:18:14,341 --> 02:18:17,560
and battles. Yeah. Though that,
which is basically the whole film.

2368
02:18:18,280 --> 02:18:21,940
It's a really good movie.
And that surprised the shit
out of me. I saw it at home.

2369
02:18:22,120 --> 02:18:25,360
I, you know, the billboard and
never did anything. I was like,

2370
02:18:25,361 --> 02:18:26,350
I don't want to see this.
I thought,

2371
02:18:26,590 --> 02:18:29,980
I thought lone survivor was one of
those like fucking Rambo movies.

2372
02:18:30,040 --> 02:18:33,280
When I saw the, I thought lone
survivor, like one against everybody,

2373
02:18:33,310 --> 02:18:35,930
like that kind of shit. Just a
fiction. That's what I thought I did.

2374
02:18:35,940 --> 02:18:38,710
I didn't look into it and it came on
when I just started and I was like,

2375
02:18:39,160 --> 02:18:41,560
it's fucking midnight. I'll
watch this. It's really good.

2376
02:18:41,590 --> 02:18:45,250
It's going to be real hard for someone
to make a fictional movie that really

2377
02:18:45,251 --> 02:18:50,250
resonates about war other than
like a hurt locker type move.

2378
02:18:50,260 --> 02:18:53,260
Right.
Where you show like some weird aberration,

2379
02:18:53,261 --> 02:18:57,720
like the student wants to keep going
back and yeah. And uncork bombs. So May,

2380
02:18:57,730 --> 02:18:59,500
I mean, my argument with art,
which you'll see it like,

2381
02:18:59,570 --> 02:19:04,300
we argue too about like how Cooper did
as far as portraying the role now that I

2382
02:19:04,301 --> 02:19:05,230
think he did a great job.

2383
02:19:05,250 --> 02:19:08,920
I mean I thought there's a lot of layers
to his performance and you see somebody

2384
02:19:08,950 --> 02:19:13,450
suffer from PTSD in the film as
effectively as you could show it.

2385
02:19:13,540 --> 02:19:18,490
I thought he did a great job. Um, did
you like zero dark 30? Yeah, I like that.

2386
02:19:18,520 --> 02:19:20,590
I'd like to,
but I didn't like is the bullshit.

2387
02:19:20,830 --> 02:19:24,210
There's one likes that fact that they
had created this woman who are, you know,

2388
02:19:24,250 --> 02:19:28,190
was the architect of this thing. And then
I found out that she exist. I went why?

2389
02:19:28,490 --> 02:19:31,460
I thought that she did exist. It's
just not what I heard. Really? Yeah.

2390
02:19:31,550 --> 02:19:35,540
That the woman that like was gone to the,
to the Messenger.

2391
02:19:36,350 --> 02:19:40,190
I heard that that was a uh, a plump
piece. Pull that up. Jamie. Makes sure,

2392
02:19:40,191 --> 02:19:43,250
I'm sure I'm correct because
I'm getting it from a ranting.

2393
02:19:43,280 --> 02:19:47,690
I'm a army ranger who had a few
beers in him. Oh really? Yeah.

2394
02:19:47,900 --> 02:19:51,000
We just all bullshit. He was explaining
to me what was bullshit about it.

2395
02:19:51,020 --> 02:19:53,720
I was bullshit that they would
never listen to her like this.

2396
02:19:53,721 --> 02:19:55,010
This whole thing is ridiculous.

2397
02:19:55,011 --> 02:19:56,930
Like the way they portrayed
everybody was ridiculous.

2398
02:19:57,400 --> 02:19:59,600
Then there's the story
which is very different.

2399
02:19:59,780 --> 02:20:02,900
The story that the guy
wrote that was there,

2400
02:20:02,901 --> 02:20:05,600
the guy who apparently was
there on the raid who wrote,

2401
02:20:05,960 --> 02:20:09,770
which differs from other peoples
versions of the event. Yeah.

2402
02:20:10,270 --> 02:20:13,190
Makes you wonder, man, I wonder
how much of these guys, you know,

2403
02:20:13,191 --> 02:20:16,730
cause the Chris Kyle thing had come under
fire from a lot of people because he

2404
02:20:16,760 --> 02:20:19,070
apparently lied about a lot of
shade up some shit for sure.

2405
02:20:19,120 --> 02:20:22,670
Made up a lot of shit in his book and
you've got to wonder how much these guys

2406
02:20:22,700 --> 02:20:27,590
are involved in this insanely
risky endeavor. Right?

2407
02:20:27,591 --> 02:20:29,630
You're,
you're fucking special ops soldier.

2408
02:20:29,631 --> 02:20:32,360
You're out there doing nothing shit in
the middle of the night with night vision,

2409
02:20:32,361 --> 02:20:37,010
shooting people, fucking high,
high, high risk. And you know, they,

2410
02:20:37,011 --> 02:20:39,650
when they realize like this is
not going to pay off financially,

2411
02:20:39,920 --> 02:20:43,340
the only way to do it. It's just fucking
listen, let's juice this story up. Yeah,

2412
02:20:43,550 --> 02:20:45,410
let's add some stuff to this.
Let's throw some,

2413
02:20:45,590 --> 02:20:47,930
some controversial shit in there that's
going to guarantee that people are going

2414
02:20:47,931 --> 02:20:52,490
to talk about it. True. You know? Yeah. I
mean, and like, you know, I, I've, I've,

2415
02:20:52,550 --> 02:20:56,090
I've saw, I've read the articles about
like things that he claimed and there's,

2416
02:20:56,091 --> 02:20:58,760
I don't know if there's a real
woman. Yeah. So it is a real woman.

2417
02:20:58,790 --> 02:21:01,400
That's what said he was
talking crazy. Say what? Okay,

2418
02:21:01,430 --> 02:21:05,090
let's find out what wasn't
true about zero, dark 30.

2419
02:21:05,210 --> 02:21:08,390
What was incorrect about
zero, dark 30. Cause, um,

2420
02:21:09,230 --> 02:21:10,250
that's a big,

2421
02:21:10,310 --> 02:21:15,310
a big thing about me lately is he's
fucking movies that are unreal life and

2422
02:21:15,621 --> 02:21:20,190
they, they make shit up. Yeah. Um,

2423
02:21:20,210 --> 02:21:24,170
because of that, a Fox catcher
movie, which, uh, was about this guy,

2424
02:21:24,171 --> 02:21:26,930
Mark Schultz who fought in the UFC and uh,

2425
02:21:27,500 --> 02:21:29,780
all sorts of bullshit and
then moving and he's actually,

2426
02:21:29,810 --> 02:21:32,720
he made a Twitter post about it yesterday,
uh,

2427
02:21:32,721 --> 02:21:36,770
asking people if they were interested
in him giving a detailed account of all

2428
02:21:36,771 --> 02:21:39,320
the inaccuracy. So the movie, he
said, if people are interested in it,

2429
02:21:39,321 --> 02:21:41,810
let me know and I'll do that.
And so people serve responding to him.

2430
02:21:41,811 --> 02:21:43,730
And I retweeted it cause I
want to know all the different,

2431
02:21:43,731 --> 02:21:47,870
cause I know a bunch of them. Yeah.
Just based on who he was at the time,

2432
02:21:47,871 --> 02:21:49,490
like that he was already a world champion,

2433
02:21:49,491 --> 02:21:53,000
that it was already one of the best
wrestlers on the planet. That he was, uh,

2434
02:21:53,360 --> 02:21:57,470
the UFC wasn't even around when they had
him watching the UFC in 1987. It didn't,

2435
02:21:57,500 --> 02:22:01,580
didn't exist. All this weird gay shit
between him and that dupont, not real,

2436
02:22:01,610 --> 02:22:05,000
no one says that like they made a bunch
of shit up to try to move the story

2437
02:22:05,001 --> 02:22:08,030
along and it's about, a guy's really
lost. I do this every movie though,

2438
02:22:08,090 --> 02:22:12,230
every movie that has a, that's
based on, you know, a real story,

2439
02:22:12,231 --> 02:22:16,340
there's added characters, added moments
to dramatize the added stuff to, to,

2440
02:22:16,620 --> 02:22:21,290
you know, peak your interest in and make
the story more interesting. And yeah,

2441
02:22:21,291 --> 02:22:25,170
it's, it's kind of a, they should
almost at the end of films put up, uh,

2442
02:22:25,530 --> 02:22:26,250
like a slate

2443
02:22:26,250 --> 02:22:27,870
that just shows you everything.

2444
02:22:27,871 --> 02:22:30,870
Like here are the scenes that
we completely had it made
up. You know what I mean?

2445
02:22:30,871 --> 02:22:33,880
So you would walk away
going, oh, okay. Yeah.

2446
02:22:34,110 --> 02:22:39,110
Well apparently there's a lot of
people that think that zero dark,

2447
02:22:39,421 --> 02:22:43,650
dirty has, there's a lot of
shit in it. That's bullshit.
Well, there's a whole, uh,

2448
02:22:43,700 --> 02:22:43,890
I'm,

2449
02:22:43,890 --> 02:22:48,890
I'm looking at several articles about
the factual errors or the things that he

2450
02:22:49,111 --> 02:22:52,830
just made, made, made up about
zero, dark 30 apparently. I mean,

2451
02:22:52,831 --> 02:22:55,560
and obviously this guy is not going to
come clean about what's accurate and not,

2452
02:22:55,561 --> 02:22:58,410
but um, it was a CIA
director at the time. Uh,

2453
02:22:59,280 --> 02:23:03,990
he's played by Gandel
Feeney in zero, dark 30. Um,

2454
02:23:04,620 --> 02:23:08,100
I can't remember what her name,
whatever. Um, but he said that like,

2455
02:23:08,130 --> 02:23:12,390
cause I think Daniel Fini
curses in the movie as him.

2456
02:23:12,870 --> 02:23:15,630
And I'm like, when he's playing
the part of this guy and he goes,

2457
02:23:15,631 --> 02:23:19,310
that's the only accurate part of
that movie. I say, fuck a lot.

2458
02:23:21,120 --> 02:23:22,530
Yeah.
Well they don't,

2459
02:23:22,560 --> 02:23:25,350
they're not really that interested in
making things accurate when they can,

2460
02:23:25,370 --> 02:23:25,590
they're,

2461
02:23:25,590 --> 02:23:28,710
they're interested in making things
accurate and not accurate enough and then

2462
02:23:28,711 --> 02:23:31,260
good. Yeah. And that's where these,
that's why I think it's like,

2463
02:23:31,290 --> 02:23:34,410
to dramatize the true story,
you have a massive obligation.

2464
02:23:34,830 --> 02:23:36,630
You have a massive obligation
to make it interesting,

2465
02:23:36,631 --> 02:23:38,820
but also to make it factual
because it's a true story.

2466
02:23:38,821 --> 02:23:42,780
A lot of people find out about certain
things and they hear about them from a

2467
02:23:42,781 --> 02:23:45,990
movie you expect like, Oh, it's
based on a true story. You know,

2468
02:23:45,991 --> 02:23:49,200
that really this guy really did this. And
then you find out, nope, never did that.

2469
02:23:49,380 --> 02:23:53,370
Like the Reuben Carter hurricane movie,
you know that movie? Yes. A dead zone.

2470
02:23:53,390 --> 02:23:57,840
Winfrey had the guy on the show and wow,
we let them loose and it's, you know,

2471
02:23:57,841 --> 02:24:00,060
the guy was in jail and it was all wrong.

2472
02:24:00,060 --> 02:24:02,040
It was against him and he could
have been the champion of the world.

2473
02:24:02,460 --> 02:24:05,280
And then there's a cop in the movie.
It's always trying to get him,

2474
02:24:05,520 --> 02:24:07,740
the cop wasn't even real.
The cop didn't exist.

2475
02:24:07,741 --> 02:24:10,860
Like this one cop that's been trying
to try to get him his whole life.

2476
02:24:11,080 --> 02:24:13,770
So you made a story about a
real guy and his real story,

2477
02:24:13,890 --> 02:24:15,630
but then you added this
character in there,

2478
02:24:15,680 --> 02:24:18,990
sort of move everything along the way.
You think it should in a good guy,

2479
02:24:18,991 --> 02:24:22,650
bad guy movie. But I see, you know,
in my limited experience with this,

2480
02:24:22,651 --> 02:24:26,620
like I have a, a script thing that I'm
working on and like when I, Oh shit,

2481
02:24:26,640 --> 02:24:29,610
when I get me Buns, when I get
the notice screenwriting. Yeah.

2482
02:24:29,640 --> 02:24:33,570
When you get notes from like producers
or network people, you're like,

2483
02:24:34,440 --> 02:24:36,750
it's always stuff like
add something like this,

2484
02:24:36,780 --> 02:24:39,650
but that this character should
have more of somebody that,

2485
02:24:39,880 --> 02:24:44,280
that challenges them this way. And
so you see like, I see how you go,

2486
02:24:44,281 --> 02:24:47,370
but isn't the meat of this like,
doesn't this work enough as a story?

2487
02:24:47,371 --> 02:24:50,100
And it's like, yeah, but
you know, this is what we,

2488
02:24:50,101 --> 02:24:53,130
this is how we make stories is
how movies and shows are made.

2489
02:24:53,131 --> 02:24:54,660
So add all these elements to it.

2490
02:24:54,900 --> 02:24:57,450
You got to have autonomy if you're
going to have your own creation. I mean,

2491
02:24:57,451 --> 02:24:59,490
cause that's the problem
with movies and TV shows.

2492
02:24:59,530 --> 02:25:02,790
They cost a lot of money to make it so
when a lot of people were putting their

2493
02:25:02,791 --> 02:25:03,570
money up,

2494
02:25:03,570 --> 02:25:06,060
they want results and they want it to
be their way and they want to get there,

2495
02:25:06,061 --> 02:25:10,070
a little greasy fingers all over,
which is why you have to listen to their,

2496
02:25:10,780 --> 02:25:12,970
their opinions.
Otherwise you'd be like,

2497
02:25:13,650 --> 02:25:16,820
imagine if that was the case with standup.
I'm actually,

2498
02:25:16,840 --> 02:25:21,160
if you became an entity as a
standup comedian, like, Hey Tom, uh,

2499
02:25:21,270 --> 02:25:23,890
we really like what you're
doing out there, so we want
to be in business with Ya.

2500
02:25:23,900 --> 02:25:25,130
So what we're gonna do is,
uh,

2501
02:25:25,390 --> 02:25:28,090
we're going to put up the money
for all your travel or your hotel,

2502
02:25:28,091 --> 02:25:31,400
going to give you a salary and we're
going to be a part of Thompson or

2503
02:25:31,410 --> 02:25:34,090
enterprises and we're going
to have meetings every week
and what are we working

2504
02:25:34,091 --> 02:25:37,240
on this week? Well, here's the script
that Bobby and the writers have come up.

2505
02:25:37,280 --> 02:25:38,860
You know,
you can alter this if you like Tom,

2506
02:25:38,861 --> 02:25:42,340
as long as of course we approve it at
the end before you go onstage and you get

2507
02:25:42,341 --> 02:25:46,120
to this, like what, what have
I done? We're so spoiled.

2508
02:25:46,150 --> 02:25:50,230
That's why it's the last and best thing
that you can never give up if you're

2509
02:25:50,231 --> 02:25:52,490
doing it. Yeah, you can't
give it up. We're so spoiled.

2510
02:25:52,600 --> 02:25:54,880
So you really get to do whatever you want.

2511
02:25:54,910 --> 02:25:57,340
And even more so now
because you have podcasts,

2512
02:25:57,940 --> 02:26:01,030
like I've seen how the podcast
has changed your whole thing, man.

2513
02:26:01,390 --> 02:26:04,690
You guys sell out everywhere now
you have like a real following.

2514
02:26:04,780 --> 02:26:09,700
Did I just did a tour? Like have one
nighters? Almost everyone was sold out.

2515
02:26:09,820 --> 02:26:14,620
I mean from uh, Hattiesburg,
Mississippi, which was unbelievable.

2516
02:26:14,650 --> 02:26:18,280
This place hubs, city comedy,
Lafayette the next night.

2517
02:26:18,380 --> 02:26:22,840
Then I did punchline in Atlanta,
Jacksonville, West Palm Beach Ban.

2518
02:26:22,870 --> 02:26:26,590
Almost every show sold out. Yeah.
And it's all podcast fans, podcasts,

2519
02:26:26,650 --> 02:26:30,580
podcasts and Netflix, the two of them
together. And it's amazing. Yeah. Yeah.

2520
02:26:30,581 --> 02:26:33,570
And this saw internet stuff, all of
it. My whole thing is internet. Yeah.

2521
02:26:33,571 --> 02:26:38,410
Isn't that amazing? Yeah.
It's amazing. It's so what,
this is a weird time for that.

2522
02:26:38,680 --> 02:26:40,300
Yeah. That's pretty cool, man.

2523
02:26:40,360 --> 02:26:43,990
It's so cool because like all the
shit that you have to deal with,

2524
02:26:43,991 --> 02:26:46,510
if you're creating a script and it has
to get passed by all these producers and

2525
02:26:46,511 --> 02:26:50,050
executives, none of that exists,
but yet all this success exists.

2526
02:26:50,440 --> 02:26:51,790
All these people love what you're doing.

2527
02:26:51,910 --> 02:26:56,530
Like what fucking studio executive
was sign off on black or Tom,

2528
02:26:59,080 --> 02:27:03,070
I don't think nine zero couldn't
have people in the room with you.

2529
02:27:03,220 --> 02:27:04,960
They would be like shaking their head,
looking at each other,

2530
02:27:04,970 --> 02:27:09,760
I'll talk to them and they would
go Tom. So, hey, um, when, well,

2531
02:27:09,790 --> 02:27:13,870
when, well, Tom are black, um, you know,

2532
02:27:13,900 --> 02:27:15,910
I just for what you get out of it,

2533
02:27:15,911 --> 02:27:18,670
I don't think it's your best
work for what you get out of it.

2534
02:27:18,671 --> 02:27:22,480
I just think it's not worth
what you, you know, what you
give up. Sure. Yeah. I mean,

2535
02:27:22,481 --> 02:27:25,380
I'm gonna show you some tweets and
the people that think, look at the,

2536
02:27:25,720 --> 02:27:27,670
the guy with the egg next to his name,

2537
02:27:28,300 --> 02:27:32,830
his name is zero dark 30 thinks you're
a racist. Yeah, we should stop. The,

2538
02:27:32,960 --> 02:27:36,370
there was like, I was on a morning news
show, you know, there's like good morning,

2539
02:27:36,371 --> 02:27:37,210
whatever things,

2540
02:27:37,720 --> 02:27:41,470
and I had on like a black
jacket and a black and gray,

2541
02:27:41,920 --> 02:27:46,360
I think either la hat or I think it was
an la hat. It was black and gray. And uh,

2542
02:27:46,390 --> 02:27:51,340
he was like big dodger fan.
And I go, no, I hate baseball.
And he was like, ah, okay.

2543
02:27:51,710 --> 02:27:55,270
And I go, I just, I just wear hats for
the colors, like black guys, you know,

2544
02:27:55,271 --> 02:27:59,530
just to match. And he was
like, Hey, like immediately it
was like, well, we'll, we'll,

2545
02:27:59,531 --> 02:28:01,960
we'll work on the areas on
the air. Yeah. I go, you know,

2546
02:28:01,961 --> 02:28:04,780
it's just like for you just wear it for
the style, like just for the colors,

2547
02:28:04,781 --> 02:28:06,010
like black guys. And he's like, okay,

2548
02:28:06,190 --> 02:28:09,160
so this weekend you're going to be at
the like, and he like, I was like, wow.

2549
02:28:09,161 --> 02:28:12,570
Like he flipped out and what was his job?
Yeah, immediately. And they're gonna,

2550
02:28:12,580 --> 02:28:14,680
he's a news. I'm the comedian.
I could say whatever I want.

2551
02:28:14,681 --> 02:28:18,550
But that for him was like, oh, super
risky. Imagine if he said that, hey,

2552
02:28:18,551 --> 02:28:22,130
I just wear hats like black
guys. And people would want
his head. Yeah, you can't,

2553
02:28:22,131 --> 02:28:26,560
you can't do that. If you're a newscaster
guy, they will have you fucking, yeah.

2554
02:28:26,600 --> 02:28:30,680
And he thought afterwards, he was like,
well, you're kind of unpredictable, Huh?

2555
02:28:30,820 --> 02:28:34,490
But you, I was like, well, it's not
really that crazy in the world though.

2556
02:28:34,491 --> 02:28:37,430
You're a little bitch. You have to
be a company bitch. In that world.

2557
02:28:37,460 --> 02:28:41,690
You can't have opinions about anything.
Everything has to be broad and like, yeah,

2558
02:28:41,840 --> 02:28:44,750
well we certainly support our
heroes. We'll be right back. Yeah.

2559
02:28:44,810 --> 02:28:47,990
Like it has to be like there
can't be any, any, any weird.

2560
02:28:48,020 --> 02:28:51,120
There's a weirdness a little
earlier today we had a guest on a,

2561
02:28:51,130 --> 02:28:54,320
he made a comment then we just like
everybody to know that uh, we did.

2562
02:28:54,321 --> 02:28:58,010
That does not reflect case Sun for news.
Yeah.

2563
02:28:58,040 --> 02:29:01,100
Anyone can wear hats of any
color and it's certainly,

2564
02:29:01,310 --> 02:29:04,280
I don't even know where he was going
with that. I didn't understand it either.

2565
02:29:04,520 --> 02:29:07,040
Anyway, moving on. Some people
were just not that talented.

2566
02:29:07,220 --> 02:29:11,810
They have to resort to shock value.
Shock. Carrot top is also going to be,

2567
02:29:12,940 --> 02:29:14,960
there's always gonna be people like that.
Unbelievable.

2568
02:29:15,110 --> 02:29:16,970
There's no getting around that.
There's always going to be,

2569
02:29:17,120 --> 02:29:21,560
those jobs are like you. Like if you're
going to be the guy on the local news,

2570
02:29:21,561 --> 02:29:25,190
like you almost have to have zero
flavor. Yeah. You can't have any flavor.

2571
02:29:25,220 --> 02:29:28,130
Flavor's bad flavors.
Dangerous gets people sued.

2572
02:29:28,520 --> 02:29:33,170
That's with morning radio djs too.
Right? Those guys are dying off.

2573
02:29:33,171 --> 02:29:34,640
There's not a whole
lot of those guys left.

2574
02:29:34,910 --> 02:29:37,910
That's what's the most funny thing about
Howard saying that podcasting is for

2575
02:29:37,911 --> 02:29:40,550
losers and you know,
it's just that the radio job,

2576
02:29:40,850 --> 02:29:42,380
which just started happening now and I,

2577
02:29:42,381 --> 02:29:44,900
and I knew this was going to
happen and it's finally happening,

2578
02:29:45,140 --> 02:29:48,980
is that like they are now
finally clubs are going,

2579
02:29:49,490 --> 02:29:52,970
there's no more radio like they're,
they're saying like you go,

2580
02:29:53,060 --> 02:29:55,370
so we you to impress my morning.
They're like, we don't do that anymore.

2581
02:29:55,850 --> 02:29:59,240
And it'll be like, it's not that like,
oh all you're completely sold out.

2582
02:29:59,241 --> 02:30:01,820
We don't have to do any press. They're
just like, it's a waste of time.

2583
02:30:02,090 --> 02:30:05,630
They finally realized in, in now that
saying all radios a waste of time,

2584
02:30:05,900 --> 02:30:09,890
but they realize in certain markets with
certain shows, they're like, there's not,

2585
02:30:10,130 --> 02:30:11,840
we're not going to pay
any more for things.

2586
02:30:11,841 --> 02:30:15,050
There's no point in bringing you there.
It doesn't turn into anything.

2587
02:30:15,410 --> 02:30:16,700
You don't have to do it.
Well,

2588
02:30:16,701 --> 02:30:19,480
there was one radio station where I did
way back in the day when I used to have

2589
02:30:19,481 --> 02:30:20,640
to do those morning shows where they,

2590
02:30:20,960 --> 02:30:25,310
they talked about how they had a deal
with this radio station where they would

2591
02:30:25,311 --> 02:30:29,270
buy ads and because they would buy ads,
the djs would,

2592
02:30:29,271 --> 02:30:33,050
it was like a bribe to get the comics
to come in and do the morning show.

2593
02:30:33,410 --> 02:30:34,970
So the comics would come
in and do the morning show,

2594
02:30:34,971 --> 02:30:37,850
tell them when they were there and they
would buy ads for the radio show during

2595
02:30:37,851 --> 02:30:40,550
the day. Wow. I was like, well,
you have to buy ads. Yeah.

2596
02:30:40,551 --> 02:30:45,160
You can't get anybody in unless you buy
ads. Like wow. It's that blatant. Blatant.

2597
02:30:45,740 --> 02:30:47,190
Yeah. It's great. Now and I've, uh,

2598
02:30:47,240 --> 02:30:51,170
there's been like markets now where I go
to and there's radio set up and I'll be

2599
02:30:51,171 --> 02:30:54,290
like, I don't want to do it. Okay.

2600
02:30:54,291 --> 02:30:58,250
And you know what turnouts like,
great. Like it's not, you know,

2601
02:30:58,850 --> 02:31:03,720
the problem with the radio is just getting
up breaks your whole brain up and you

2602
02:31:03,721 --> 02:31:05,930
always roll the dice.
There's some great guys doing radio,

2603
02:31:05,960 --> 02:31:08,480
but then there's also shows, we
were like, do this. This is a waste.

2604
02:31:08,510 --> 02:31:12,170
Why are we doing that? Could get bad.
That's worse than getting up for me.

2605
02:31:12,171 --> 02:31:13,910
I think it was like when you
get there and they're like,

2606
02:31:14,270 --> 02:31:15,200
what are you going to ask you?

2607
02:31:15,740 --> 02:31:20,220
What every once a lie's a slessinger
had some crazy happened recently.

2608
02:31:20,580 --> 02:31:22,580
Oh, I think I heard
about that. Yeah. I'll,

2609
02:31:22,581 --> 02:31:25,140
I'll let her tell it next
time she was here. But like,

2610
02:31:25,141 --> 02:31:28,830
she cracked a joke and she didn't realize
that like this dude's mom was dead.

2611
02:31:29,670 --> 02:31:33,870
And uh, the dude like, yeah, kind
of opened the door to begin with.

2612
02:31:34,320 --> 02:31:36,630
I don't remember the exact way it went,

2613
02:31:37,260 --> 02:31:40,830
but it was a classic example.
It was a classic example.

2614
02:31:40,831 --> 02:31:42,720
I could call her and have
her talk about it on the air.

2615
02:31:43,140 --> 02:31:47,130
Let's see if she'll do that.
Let's see if she even answers.

2616
02:31:48,280 --> 02:31:48,890
Okay.

2617
02:31:48,890 --> 02:31:50,900
Give it a shot. I've never
done this before. Fuck it.

2618
02:31:51,320 --> 02:31:55,430
But it's just highlighting
how those people can be a
huge pain in the ass. Yeah.

2619
02:31:57,960 --> 02:31:59,670
Let's see. You know, patch it in

2620
02:31:59,740 --> 02:32:00,573
to the speaker phone.

2621
02:32:00,840 --> 02:32:04,200
Yeah, this is how I do, it's
high tech. High Tech is fuck.

2622
02:32:05,030 --> 02:32:05,863
Okay.

2623
02:32:07,060 --> 02:32:07,893
Okay.

2624
02:32:10,130 --> 02:32:10,963
What does that

2625
02:32:11,400 --> 02:32:13,560
sounds like?
What the heck?

2626
02:32:14,410 --> 02:32:17,790
That's the government. It's the
government cutting out Joe. Really good.

2627
02:32:18,010 --> 02:32:22,540
Stop talking and I say he doesn't need
this. And what does that little weird,

2628
02:32:27,710 --> 02:32:30,670
yeah, that would be a
problem. Oh Man. Yeah.

2629
02:32:30,671 --> 02:32:33,420
It starts getting text asshole face.

2630
02:32:35,730 --> 02:32:36,563
I feel that

2631
02:32:38,140 --> 02:32:42,330
the goal of doing standup
long enough and uh, like the,

2632
02:32:42,331 --> 02:32:46,060
the biggest mark of success is being
like, oh, I don't have to do radio.

2633
02:32:46,600 --> 02:32:50,480
That's the dream. I know. But some
places the dream was to do radio.

2634
02:32:50,481 --> 02:32:54,790
Some places it was like to get on the
Bob and Tom Show, you know Bob and Tom,

2635
02:32:54,791 --> 02:32:56,440
they fucking said no to Joey Diaz.

2636
02:32:56,710 --> 02:33:00,430
He was supposed to go there and someone
saw something on youtube that he did or

2637
02:33:00,431 --> 02:33:02,730
most likely everything on youtube.
Yeah.

2638
02:33:03,580 --> 02:33:06,490
Anything he's ever seen that's ever
said, ever. Everybody, everything.

2639
02:33:06,520 --> 02:33:10,180
I have conversation, they pulled them
off. They pulled them off the show. Yeah.

2640
02:33:10,181 --> 02:33:12,410
He sold out every show.
I tweeted the shit out of it.

2641
02:33:12,411 --> 02:33:13,840
He sold out every fucking show.

2642
02:33:14,050 --> 02:33:17,320
And then Bob and Tom got hit
with a deluge of insults.

2643
02:33:17,650 --> 02:33:20,520
You know that you guys are old.
You're fucking idiots. Your losers.

2644
02:33:20,521 --> 02:33:23,950
He's the funniest game man. Earth. You
know them up because of a youtube video.

2645
02:33:23,951 --> 02:33:27,260
He's not the youtube video. You stupid
fucks. Wow. I don't know what it,

2646
02:33:27,310 --> 02:33:30,420
what happened, who's decision
it was to do that. But what's,

2647
02:33:30,830 --> 02:33:34,300
so those guys are really good guys too.
I've done the show before and I super,

2648
02:33:34,301 --> 02:33:37,950
super nice guys. I don't know whose
decision it was to not have Joey on.

2649
02:33:37,951 --> 02:33:41,520
It's just so dumb. That's stupid. He's a
professional. He doesn't swear on the air.

2650
02:33:41,550 --> 02:33:45,400
It's not going to do anything stupid. No.
Come on indeed. And might bring in some,

2651
02:33:45,401 --> 02:33:49,810
uh, some, some traits for people to try.
Might you might Joe's yeah, he might doze.

2652
02:33:49,820 --> 02:33:50,653
Yeah,

2653
02:33:52,670 --> 02:33:55,690

breakfast burrito yet. Try this.
