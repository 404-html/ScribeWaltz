1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:02,910
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:04,920
In the heterosexual world,

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:08,550
what percentage of strip clubs
in the United States are for men?

4
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:10,110
Well,

5
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:10,950
there's a lot more,

6
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:11,933
I'm sure

7
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:20,220
there's like one
Chippendales in the county.

8
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:25,590
You got to do some research
and if they're only open on,

9
00:00:25,591 --> 00:00:26,370
you know,

10
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:30,160
you gotta make your reservations
and shit the fucking like,

11
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:31,620
it's a different experience.

12
00:00:31,621 --> 00:00:34,050
Like when girls go to see men strip,

13
00:00:34,051 --> 00:00:35,400
they scream,

14
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:40,590
they scream and they throw money in the
air and they look crazy and they'll rub

15
00:00:40,591 --> 00:00:42,060
their face on the dude's dicks.

16
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:44,310
Like girls at Bachelorette parties,

17
00:00:44,311 --> 00:00:45,144
they go fucking,

18
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:48,390
why is it because they don't go as much.

19
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:49,231
Like as often,

20
00:00:49,231 --> 00:00:50,064
you know,

21
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:50,881
agreement.

22
00:00:50,881 --> 00:00:52,770
They could go off on bachelor
parties and they're not.

23
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:54,210
Yeah,

24
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:55,320
they're not going to say shit.

25
00:00:55,321 --> 00:00:58,080
It's like what happens at the
Bachelorette party stays there.

26
00:00:58,410 --> 00:00:58,771
Right.

27
00:00:58,771 --> 00:01:02,280
I had a dear friend of mine who
I used to do taekwondo with,

28
00:01:02,281 --> 00:01:03,390
that was a male stripper.

29
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:04,560
Two Friends of mine actually.

30
00:01:04,561 --> 00:01:07,110
One was his young Puerto
Rican kid and the other one,

31
00:01:07,111 --> 00:01:11,670
this is older white dude and the older
bite to it was a really nice guy.

32
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:12,570
Very smart guy.

33
00:01:12,571 --> 00:01:14,820
But he was like over the top.

34
00:01:14,821 --> 00:01:16,560
Strange Big Jack.

35
00:01:16,561 --> 00:01:17,700
Was He shredded though?

36
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,910
Jack Black Belt.

37
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:21,480
Black Belt martial artist.

38
00:01:21,481 --> 00:01:22,800
He was a big Jack Dude,

39
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:23,251
you know,

40
00:01:23,251 --> 00:01:24,150
but he was telling me,

41
00:01:24,151 --> 00:01:24,571
he was like,

42
00:01:24,571 --> 00:01:25,111
these women,

43
00:01:25,111 --> 00:01:26,130
they go fucking crazy.

44
00:01:26,131 --> 00:01:28,220
Like it gets really
scratching calm and shit.

45
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:29,130
Just sucking tech

46
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:31,530
friends.

47
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:32,490
The girls who were getting married,

48
00:01:32,491 --> 00:01:33,960
we just suck his dick in
front of their friends.

49
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:35,850
But to the guys,

50
00:01:35,851 --> 00:01:38,420
a strip club to dudes by
himself in the quarter,

51
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:41,610
all quite as fluff fucking

52
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,430
strip clubs when it was dead as fuck.

53
00:01:47,431 --> 00:01:51,130
I worked those Saturday
day shifts that shitty.

54
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:56,120
You open up on 11 and there's one
girl and no dude's and realize wait

55
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:00,540
[inaudible] the security cameras the see.

56
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:05,370
And then one guy walks in but
only sit there and he's just,

57
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:07,730
it's Saturday and one 15

58
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,550
girl.

59
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:14,360
She's fucking rag in

60
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,793
Shitty Shit.

61
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,380
And I'm sitting there playing
Depeche mode and shit.

62
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:28,320
It was dark friends like,

63
00:02:28,321 --> 00:02:28,561
dude,

64
00:02:28,561 --> 00:02:29,860
you're so lucky you

65
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:39,060
just orgies going on.

66
00:02:39,061 --> 00:02:41,080
And I'm like Dj and like eating pussy

67
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,570
French like,

68
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:47,090
dude,

69
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:47,940
give me a job.

70
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:52,180
I'll just pick up cokes and shit.

71
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:55,831
Man,

72
00:02:55,831 --> 00:02:56,850
you're so lucky.

73
00:02:56,851 --> 00:02:57,210
I'm like,

74
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:58,043
ah.

75
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:00,640
But then ended up moving
up and getting good shifts.

76
00:03:00,641 --> 00:03:02,950
You just wait for the DJ and yeah,

77
00:03:02,951 --> 00:03:03,761
when you first get in,

78
00:03:03,761 --> 00:03:04,930
you got the worst shifts.

79
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:06,100
Saturday day,

80
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,540
Monday day,

81
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,140
Saturday day one,

82
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:11,440
Jay darkness.

83
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:12,551
That's really funny.

84
00:03:12,551 --> 00:03:12,731
You know,

85
00:03:12,731 --> 00:03:13,870
I had them ever reminds me,

86
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:18,490
I used to have a pretty serious hard
drug problem to which a hard drugs,

87
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,280
which I,

88
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,120
I done,

89
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:23,380
you know which ones heroin
and crack and oh damn.

90
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:24,391
Gotten through it.

91
00:03:24,391 --> 00:03:26,830
And the needle or the
smart starting smoking,

92
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:27,740
smoking,

93
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:28,300
no needles,

94
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,133
no needles.

95
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:30,010
Stayed away from that,

96
00:03:30,011 --> 00:03:30,551
but you know,

97
00:03:30,551 --> 00:03:32,650
made it through and I'm damn him.

98
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:33,550
How'd you get on that?

99
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,713
How to get on him.

100
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:36,470
Um,

101
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:37,413
oh,

102
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,033
pain.

103
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,210
You had some injuries or something.

104
00:03:40,211 --> 00:03:41,200
No pain.

105
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:42,021
Emotional pain,

106
00:03:42,021 --> 00:03:42,790
muscle pain,

107
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:43,630
emotional suffering,

108
00:03:43,631 --> 00:03:43,931
pain,

109
00:03:43,931 --> 00:03:44,471
last,

110
00:03:44,471 --> 00:03:45,304
aimless,

111
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:46,420
wandering the world.

112
00:03:46,421 --> 00:03:46,811
Aimless,

113
00:03:46,811 --> 00:03:47,740
not knowing what to do.

114
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:50,020
And that was the escape was the heroine.

115
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,790
Somebody introduced me to it about that
period in time and it just was like,

116
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:55,450
oh wow.

117
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:55,781
You know,

118
00:03:55,781 --> 00:03:58,960
heroin has the great ability of,

119
00:03:58,961 --> 00:03:59,470
um,

120
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:03,490
and it's really seductive and really
fucked up of making you think that your

121
00:04:03,491 --> 00:04:06,070
life is okay when you're in the gutter.

122
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:07,690
Wow.

123
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:09,010
It has that sort of,

124
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:13,150
that shooting that it just kind
of bubble it puts over you.

125
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:18,390
You can be literally living in an alleyway
high on heroin thinking you've got it

126
00:04:18,581 --> 00:04:19,414
going on.

127
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:20,020
Wow.

128
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:20,201
Yeah,

129
00:04:20,201 --> 00:04:22,690
it's really weird and perverse like that.

130
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,160
And at that time in my life,

131
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,540
I mean my dad just died.

132
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:26,860
Um,

133
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:27,461
and you know,

134
00:04:27,461 --> 00:04:28,241
when he died,

135
00:04:28,241 --> 00:04:28,930
what with it,

136
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:33,930
what went with it was kind of my life
up until I was 22 up until that point.

137
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,070
Like my life was in that bubble,

138
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:36,610
you know,

139
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,170
he was larger than life.

140
00:04:38,171 --> 00:04:39,070
He was famous,

141
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:40,211
you know,

142
00:04:40,211 --> 00:04:41,890
girls came with that work,

143
00:04:41,891 --> 00:04:42,790
came with that,

144
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,410
a scene came with that.

145
00:04:44,411 --> 00:04:47,590
Friends came with that and
when he died that just,

146
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:48,491
I went,

147
00:04:48,491 --> 00:04:48,881
poof,

148
00:04:48,881 --> 00:04:50,530
girls want to bang you because you were,

149
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:50,981
oh,

150
00:04:50,981 --> 00:04:51,381
of course.

151
00:04:51,381 --> 00:04:52,310
Delivery son course.

152
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:52,630
Yeah.

153
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:54,010
Really Nice.

154
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:55,510
It worked out for awhile.

155
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:58,630
Did you put on like a guru attitude?

156
00:04:58,631 --> 00:04:59,110
Like,

157
00:04:59,110 --> 00:04:59,661
Oh God,

158
00:04:59,661 --> 00:05:00,041
it lacks,

159
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:03,040
I've got it all going
on ladies at that time,

160
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:03,850
that,

161
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:05,120
that stage in my life now,

162
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:06,310
I was a disaster

163
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:10,120
and I tried to do that
now though in the kitchen.

164
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:10,511
Oh,

165
00:05:10,511 --> 00:05:10,811
but no,

166
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:11,710
I had a good story minutes.

167
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,530
It was really funny and like you were
talking about soliciting the government

168
00:05:14,531 --> 00:05:14,891
for money,

169
00:05:14,891 --> 00:05:16,060
for being an acid casualties,

170
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:16,930
which is a good idea.

171
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:19,180
But I was really high and crack once,

172
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:19,780
um,

173
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:21,100
and just kind of on a bender,

174
00:05:21,101 --> 00:05:25,780
just losing my mind and
crack and I thought in the
middle of the night and be a

175
00:05:25,781 --> 00:05:30,550
really good idea to join the
CIA and that they would want me,

176
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:32,950
me specifically being
like Tim Leary's Kit,

177
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:37,510
they'd want me because I have access
to shit that they want access to.

178
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:38,050
Right.

179
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:39,100
Like I can be an inside.

180
00:05:39,101 --> 00:05:41,920
I was a mall and it was high
on crack and I downloaded,

181
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:43,990
I filled out the form.

182
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,481
I got that deep.

183
00:05:46,481 --> 00:05:47,680
I spent hours on it.

184
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:48,520
It's really long.

185
00:05:48,521 --> 00:05:49,500
Complicated though.

186
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:51,850
The whole kindest joined the CIA,

187
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:52,721
printed out,

188
00:05:52,721 --> 00:05:53,550
sent it in the mail,

189
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:54,540
sense it in the mail,

190
00:05:54,541 --> 00:05:55,090
in your mouth.

191
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:57,350
You're in the CIA there
with Anderson Cooper.

192
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,370
He worked for CNN.

193
00:05:58,420 --> 00:05:59,253
Well yeah,

194
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,520
you're in there and never heard back.

195
00:06:01,521 --> 00:06:02,810
But it was never heard back.

196
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:05,150
Maybe never seen laughing,

197
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,190
laughed and threw it in the garbage,

198
00:06:07,191 --> 00:06:07,491
I'm sure.

199
00:06:07,491 --> 00:06:10,730
But it was really funny and kind of
a great delusional high on drugs,

200
00:06:10,731 --> 00:06:11,180
man.

201
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:11,631
Wow.

202
00:06:11,631 --> 00:06:13,850
So what did you think
that you were going to do?

203
00:06:13,851 --> 00:06:14,090
What?

204
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:16,280
Like as nomad a operative.

205
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:17,191
Are we going to do,

206
00:06:17,191 --> 00:06:19,670
we gotta fix it from
the inside with crack?

207
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,313
Yeah,

208
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:22,890
something like that.

209
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:24,261
Wow.

210
00:06:24,261 --> 00:06:25,280
Something crazy.

211
00:06:25,281 --> 00:06:25,820
You know,

212
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:26,780
like you can't fuck them,

213
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:27,950
but you could kill him.

214
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:28,580
Yeah,

215
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:29,211
you can eat them,

216
00:06:29,211 --> 00:06:30,020
but you can't fuck them.

217
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:30,290
Yeah.

218
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:32,210
So you can't do a dual purpose.

219
00:06:32,211 --> 00:06:33,021
You can't kill him.

220
00:06:33,021 --> 00:06:33,441
Fuck him.

221
00:06:33,441 --> 00:06:35,780
Then eat them because then
you're fucking a dead animal.

222
00:06:35,781 --> 00:06:36,614
And that's gross.

223
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:38,973
Illegal.

224
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:42,610
I think it's more legal to fuck
a dead animal than a live animal.

225
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:43,451
Does that make sense?

226
00:06:43,451 --> 00:06:44,310
Because what are you doing?

227
00:06:44,311 --> 00:06:46,990
And then you're really just masturbating
cause there's not a living thing in

228
00:06:46,991 --> 00:06:47,824
your presence.

229
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:48,900
It can't be raped

230
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:49,680
debt.

231
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,830
But you notice how there's like stages
of like how you feel about the dead

232
00:06:52,831 --> 00:06:53,430
animal.

233
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:56,190
There's like one stage
one is the live animal,

234
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:56,580
right?

235
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:58,750
If you fucking alive
animal you crazy asshole,

236
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:02,220
what are you subject to that animal
to sage to your fucking a dead animal.

237
00:07:02,221 --> 00:07:03,360
Like what is wrong with you?

238
00:07:03,361 --> 00:07:04,080
Like why?

239
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,460
Why do you want to fuck this thing?

240
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:08,280
Forget about whether you
should be able to do it,

241
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:11,610
but if you kill it and then eat it right,

242
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:15,030
everybody's fine with that because that's
like what you're supposed to do but

243
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:16,830
you can't fuck it's body.

244
00:07:16,831 --> 00:07:19,140
But what if you just jerked
off with a chicken cutlet?

245
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:20,203
What if you took a chicken,

246
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:22,980
he wrapped around your Dick and
someone came in the room and like,

247
00:07:22,981 --> 00:07:24,210
what the fuck you doing Greg?

248
00:07:24,211 --> 00:07:24,361
Like,

249
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:24,601
dude,

250
00:07:24,601 --> 00:07:25,111
I'm telling you,

251
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:28,440
it sounds crazy but it feels so good and
I just cleaned it up and then I eat it

252
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:30,530
for dinner.

253
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:31,363
It takes a bite.

254
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:32,790
What's this nice cream sauce?

255
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:34,923
How dare you,

256
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:37,740
now that you say fucking a chicken cutlet,

257
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:41,590
it's all I can think about it
because he had slippery Bree.

258
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:43,070
It's soft.

259
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:44,280
When those GMO chickens,

260
00:07:44,281 --> 00:07:45,450
it would wrap right around your heart.

261
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,440
Hell yeah.

262
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,060
And it's a breast.

263
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,160
You thinking about it being
at your tit fuck in it.

264
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,720
You know what you would do?

265
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:55,880
You would take a bag like a,

266
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:56,120
what?

267
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,380
I'm Ziploc storage bags.

268
00:07:57,381 --> 00:08:02,060
You get the chicken cutlet in the bag
and then heat up some water to about a 99

269
00:08:02,061 --> 00:08:07,061
degrees and then you dunk the chicken
cutlet in the water so that it heats up.

270
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,091
It gets,

271
00:08:08,091 --> 00:08:10,180
but you know like a body skin temperature.

272
00:08:10,181 --> 00:08:10,291
Yeah.

273
00:08:10,291 --> 00:08:13,080
Then you just covered
that bitch with k y yeah.

274
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,540
Just lather it in there.

275
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:16,410
And then you put an oven Mitt on

276
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:19,903
the cutlet.

277
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:22,070
You wrapped that Cutler around your shaft.

278
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,900
Oh,

279
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:25,550
crimes against humanity.

280
00:08:25,551 --> 00:08:26,720
Never felt so good.

281
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,110
And then yeah,

282
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:31,943
you can eat it,

283
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:32,890
eat it.

284
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:35,710
You're gonna Cook that Shit
because you've tenderized it.

285
00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:38,630
Especially like you don't
have to use in edible oil.

286
00:08:38,631 --> 00:08:42,590
You could jerk off with a nice
avocado oil or coconut oil.

287
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:43,040
You,

288
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:43,401
you know,

289
00:08:43,401 --> 00:08:46,310
avocado oil has a high
flashpoints oil to jerk off with.

290
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:46,820
Yes.

291
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:47,850
Cause then after you're done,

292
00:08:47,851 --> 00:08:49,790
as long as you don't come on your chicken,

293
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:50,611
oh,

294
00:08:50,611 --> 00:08:50,871
you know,

295
00:08:50,871 --> 00:08:51,561
you pull out,

296
00:08:51,561 --> 00:08:52,394
that's gross.

297
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,480
We don't want to come on your food.

298
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,250
But that way we'll be like really green.

299
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:55,850
Yeah.

300
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:57,050
Multiple uses.

301
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,273
I love it.

302
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:05,730
[inaudible]

303
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:08,040
yeah.
