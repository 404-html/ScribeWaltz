1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:03,930
Gentle man,
what's up?

2
00:00:03,931 --> 00:00:08,931
You dirty bitches were live.
Refresh your browser saying you could 

3
00:00:08,931 --> 00:00:12,831
see us in the youth stream like we are 
seeing ourselves.

4
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:16,800
I muted it.
You Fuck,

5
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,570
you can't get me.
Good job.

6
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:21,960
Yeah.
So.

7
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:26,430
Hi everybody.
It's a week like 20 or some shit.

8
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:31,460
This is insane dude.
With this is we're all the way into may 

9
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:32,160
almost.
This is April 27th.

10
00:00:32,161 --> 00:00:32,850
Is that what it is?
Yeah,

11
00:00:32,851 --> 00:00:35,550
we started the late December.
Yeah,

12
00:00:35,551 --> 00:00:37,380
we started at the beginning of the 
Christmas.

13
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,810
Yeah.
We basically started at the beginning of

14
00:00:39,811 --> 00:00:44,811
the year and here we are.
It was a number three last week on the 

15
00:00:44,811 --> 00:00:48,681
itunes for podcasts,
which is ridiculous because the fucking 

16
00:00:48,751 --> 00:00:51,360
production value is God damn awful for 
itunes.

17
00:00:51,361 --> 00:00:53,240
I Apologize Ladies and gentlemen.
It's Kinda,

18
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:58,660
it's Kinda cool to get better.
Well it's definitely it's garage,

19
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:04,400
but uh,
we got a bunch of new shit coming where 

20
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:04,400
right now.

21
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:04,400
This is just my,
uh,

22
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,730
my desk,
um,

23
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:10,830
we have cleaned everything out and the 
couch couches coming in Thursday and the

24
00:01:10,831 --> 00:01:13,740
green screen slightly after that we got 
new,

25
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:16,000
a MP,
three audio recorder,

26
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:20,440
some big fucking serious jammies here 
before the cow,

27
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:25,470
smallest after accounts saying it is 
okay to use dreams [inaudible] up on me.

28
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,920
I've been watching.
We just went from zero to 850 viewers 

29
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:31,080
within what,
two minutes?

30
00:01:31,081 --> 00:01:36,081
One minute.
And then let's sort of those boring or 

31
00:01:36,081 --> 00:01:36,990
so this is some new shit.
We got to make the sound better for you.

32
00:01:36,991 --> 00:01:41,991
I tunes people and thank you very much 
for putting up with it up to this wall 

33
00:01:41,991 --> 00:01:45,360
and I appreciate all your suggestions 
and I know people get harsh with the 

34
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,441
criticisms,
but the bottom line is that's your real 

35
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:48,441
opinion and uh,
I appreciate it.

36
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:48,441
You know,
um,

37
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:49,410
I've got a thick skin.

38
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:54,650
I've been in show business for a long 
time and most people have been saying I 

39
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:56,220
suck ever since day one.
So you get used to it.

40
00:01:56,221 --> 00:01:58,140
But I think all your criticisms are 
valid.

41
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:00,030
Uh,
we're working on the production quality.

42
00:02:00,031 --> 00:02:04,620
We have real microphones now of course 
we have this and then we also have.

43
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:06,630
I'll have to hold onto this for a 
second.

44
00:02:06,631 --> 00:02:10,230
We bought some serious sennheiser 
microphones just like you would use in a

45
00:02:10,231 --> 00:02:15,231
recording studio.
So at the end of the day when all is 

46
00:02:15,231 --> 00:02:18,881
said and done alcohol swabs to clean 
that shit off and make it all nice.

47
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:21,210
Nice.
We don't want to,

48
00:02:21,211 --> 00:02:25,050
I guess get nerves,
but uh,

49
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:29,100
so we're turning this thing into a real,
a production studio.

50
00:02:29,101 --> 00:02:31,680
We're going to have cameras on tripods 
and the whole deal.

51
00:02:31,681 --> 00:02:33,930
And I'm stealing a page out of Anthony 
Kumi.

52
00:02:33,931 --> 00:02:38,931
His book,
Anthony Kumiai is one of the dudes from 

53
00:02:38,931 --> 00:02:38,931
opiod,
Anthony.

54
00:02:38,931 --> 00:02:42,240
Super Cool Guy and he does a bad ass 
radio show from his house.

55
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:43,470
Um,
and uh,

56
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,830
he's one of the ones that gave me really
the first inspiration to do it because I

57
00:02:46,831 --> 00:02:49,470
saw his son up and he set up his fucking
bad ass.

58
00:02:49,471 --> 00:02:52,410
He hasn't set up basically just like a 
real radio show,

59
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:57,710
you know,
with like real jam and microphones and 

60
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:00,080
he has a backdrop and a green screen.
So I'm basically stealing anthony's idea

61
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:04,520
with his blessing and with all due 
credit to Mr Kumi,

62
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:09,580
I should add something to it.
They're like a hot tub or something 

63
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:12,240
crazy.
Anthony is do when you were with us in 

64
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:12,240
New York last time,

65
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:12,240
right?
You see his gun?

66
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:16,800
Yeah.
Carries the gun around a special permit 

67
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,251
to so you can carry a gun everywhere.
It was weird when they brought it up 

68
00:03:19,251 --> 00:03:19,251
because everyone else in the room was 
like,

69
00:03:19,251 --> 00:03:19,251
oh,

70
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:24,180
they were all like,
they're all concerned about him.

71
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:29,240
They're all worried that he's going to 
go bananas and kill a bunch of people 

72
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:29,240
would she may very well.

73
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,660
What kinds kind of make that already.
If you bring a gun into a room,

74
00:03:30,661 --> 00:03:31,710
even if you're comfortable with your 
gun,

75
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:36,711
you're now like,
that guy has a weapon that could kill 

76
00:03:36,711 --> 00:03:36,711
me.

77
00:03:36,711 --> 00:03:36,711
Yeah.
That is kind of weird,

78
00:03:36,711 --> 00:03:36,711
right?
That he wants to do that all the time.

79
00:03:36,711 --> 00:03:41,241
I have gone to and I appreciate you 
wanting to shoot them and use them and 

80
00:03:41,241 --> 00:03:44,361
it's good to have something to protect 
yourself because there's a lot of crazy 

81
00:03:44,361 --> 00:03:44,730
flux out there,
but carrying one everywhere.

82
00:03:44,731 --> 00:03:47,760
It's just a little strange,
but I just say what the fuck.

83
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:49,330
It's like better to happen.
Yeah.

84
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:54,560
What's that expression?
A better than need it and to have it 

85
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,540
than not needed and have it.
Something like that.

86
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:59,300
So like that,
you know,

87
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,420
better to not have it and not need it 
than to need it and not have it.

88
00:04:03,421 --> 00:04:05,130
That's the expression.
But uh,

89
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:07,460
yeah,
I mean he's fucking walk around drafts.

90
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:10,400
It's crazy.
It's a big ass fucking gun man.

91
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:13,250
He's got a glock on them at all times 
with talents,

92
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:14,490
black talent,
bullets.

93
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:17,220
I have some of those too,
but black towns are like,

94
00:04:17,221 --> 00:04:18,570
they don't make em anymore,
man.

95
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:23,780
They shred you up really black towels.
They don't just go through you as it 

96
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:25,250
goes to spreads out.
So like talents,

97
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:27,840
like treads the inside of your body out?
Yeah.

98
00:04:27,841 --> 00:04:30,420
From Mexico.
Mortar grenade or something like that.

99
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:35,540
Yeah man.
That he carries a gun or they just 

100
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:35,540
stopped making.
Oh,

101
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:36,580
there's still legal if you have them,
if you have them,

102
00:04:36,581 --> 00:04:41,581
your grandfather and I believe you can't
go out and get them in Anthony's while 

103
00:04:41,581 --> 00:04:42,630
those graphs and he finds out that Oh,
these fucks.

104
00:04:42,631 --> 00:04:47,631
They're making things illegal.
He'll go into the store and buy like 

105
00:04:47,631 --> 00:04:47,631
fucking,
you know,

106
00:04:47,631 --> 00:04:48,750
like wheel barrel falls.
He's crazy.

107
00:04:48,751 --> 00:04:53,751
He's got like a room in his office or 
his house that used to be a walk in 

108
00:04:53,751 --> 00:04:57,831
closet.
Whereas girl used to keep our shit and 

109
00:04:57,831 --> 00:04:57,831
now it's an armory.

110
00:04:57,831 --> 00:05:02,060
It's an armory.
His room is all guns and ammunition and 

111
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:05,901
rifles and ak 47 [inaudible] and fucking
pistols and everything and it's got 

112
00:05:05,901 --> 00:05:07,430
alarms,
like you have to press separate lumps.

113
00:05:07,431 --> 00:05:10,710
You get into that room retinal scanning 
the Goddamn punisher man.

114
00:05:10,711 --> 00:05:15,711
Yeah.
He's going to fucking room in his house 

115
00:05:15,711 --> 00:05:15,711
with an alarm.
My dedicated to guns.

116
00:05:15,711 --> 00:05:16,970
You open a door and so lik,
you know,

117
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:20,130
with like cool lighting and shells and 
the compound to house houses.

118
00:05:20,131 --> 00:05:21,390
The compound.
He's,

119
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:23,090
he's alone man.
But,

120
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,230
but being alone makes for fun radio.
He's fucking great on the radio.

121
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:28,860
He's hilarious.
He's just funny guy.

122
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,470
I liked him.
He's a yeah,

123
00:05:30,471 --> 00:05:32,130
that's one of the coolest radio shows to
do.

124
00:05:32,131 --> 00:05:36,330
I have been doing them since like 2000.
This is fucking great.

125
00:05:36,331 --> 00:05:39,300
Show so much fun.
It's just the best hand.

126
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:44,530
You know.
Jim Norton is the funniest guy on radio 

127
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:44,530
for sure.

128
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:47,450
That guy's Goddamn Polaris and the way I
just mean and nasty and quick like is 

129
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:51,360
the shit that he says like anytime 
there's some new thing in the news,

130
00:05:51,361 --> 00:05:53,550
he's always get like a million.
Any refund.

131
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,710
He's just riff and just talking shit 
about people.

132
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:58,310
If you haven't listened to them,
opie and anthony,

133
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:00,410
every radio show is hit and miss.
You know what I mean?

134
00:06:00,411 --> 00:06:02,300
You can't even this fucking thing we're 
doing,

135
00:06:02,301 --> 00:06:07,301
obviously it's hit and miss.
You can't be awesome all the time 

136
00:06:07,301 --> 00:06:07,301
because it's just talking.
You know?

137
00:06:07,301 --> 00:06:09,470
It's like when you talk for hours at a 
time,

138
00:06:09,471 --> 00:06:11,240
they're talking for like four hours at a
time.

139
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:13,550
There's going to be times you're doing 
something sucks.

140
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:18,170
Did you follow the Tito's Shit at all?
Should we talk about that?

141
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:21,520
I got to talk about it because I think 
it's very crazy,

142
00:06:21,521 --> 00:06:22,840
especially if you're following it 
through.

143
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:24,760
If you don't know,
and if you don't know,

144
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:29,930
tell us what was supposedly.
Tito was just arrested for allegedly 

145
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:33,160
beating up Jenna Jamison and,
and then he came out and said,

146
00:06:33,161 --> 00:06:35,140
I never hit her.
She has a big.

147
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:38,320
Oxy was Oxycontin,
oxycontin problems,

148
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:43,330
you know,
so it's fucked up on drugs and that's 

149
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:43,330
it.
So what I thought,

150
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:45,040
I thought that was weird.
And then I was watching this clip on tmz

151
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:47,860
where it was Jenna saying he did not 
beat me up.

152
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:50,290
We had a altercation,
you know,

153
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:52,840
but he did not beat me up.
People are thinking he's a wife beater.

154
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:55,840
Then like a half hour later,
an hour later,

155
00:06:55,841 --> 00:06:58,540
Tito puts out a press conference saying,
Hey,

156
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:03,630
she is fucked up on Oxycontin.
And then immediately her story now is 

157
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:07,630
wearing an arm brace.
He beat me up and threw me in a brace in

158
00:07:07,631 --> 00:07:08,530
the.
Even in the beginning,

159
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:14,070
but,
but saying that he beat me up and threw 

160
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:14,070
me in a hot tub and all this,

161
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:14,800
throwing a chicken arts hub.
If you're gonna,

162
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:16,410
if you're gonna throw a chicken or 
something.

163
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:17,790
Well,
how to have a good banker.

164
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:19,190
Yeah.
But she's a porn star,

165
00:07:19,191 --> 00:07:24,191
so you should be allowed to throw her in
a hot tub that comes along with a 

166
00:07:24,191 --> 00:07:25,120
dating,
a porn star fucker.

167
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:27,500
She retired and ms dot.
But uh,

168
00:07:27,501 --> 00:07:27,700
um,

169
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:30,900
so I think she had a,
I think she had the uh,

170
00:07:30,901 --> 00:07:32,640
the thing on her arm in the beginning 
did shit.

171
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:33,920
Yeah.
But,

172
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:36,330
but it was kind of weird how the story 
changed.

173
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:36,870
Right?
Well,

174
00:07:36,871 --> 00:07:37,740
if she does have,
I have

175
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:39,510
that problem,
that's a terrible problem.

176
00:07:39,511 --> 00:07:43,980
And I know a dude who had that problem 
for a long time and he,

177
00:07:43,981 --> 00:07:45,600
uh,
he got prescriptions from.

178
00:07:45,601 --> 00:07:49,350
He lived in Texas and he moved to La and
you got prescriptions from both doctors.

179
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,590
You just couldn't help himself.
He's very self indulgent and he just got

180
00:07:52,591 --> 00:07:55,050
whacked out on that Shit.
But apparently it's,

181
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:57,750
it's easy.
It's hard to get off and easy to get on.

182
00:07:57,890 --> 00:07:59,390
Like you just start popping up,
move.

183
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:02,310
We've talked before on this show about a
documentary,

184
00:08:02,311 --> 00:08:04,440
and we'll just briefly say it,
if you haven't seen it,

185
00:08:04,441 --> 00:08:09,441
just google the oxycontin express and 
it's all about how many people are 

186
00:08:10,651 --> 00:08:13,950
addicted to this stuff in Florida where 
they're wacky laws.

187
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:16,170
Florida doesn't have a database of 
doctors,

188
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:21,260
so the way my friend did it,
he got a prescription in Texas and he 

189
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:24,251
got a prescription here in California 
and then he started using ballroom at 

190
00:08:24,251 --> 00:08:27,861
the same time,
getting both of them were filled and 

191
00:08:27,861 --> 00:08:27,861
I've got all fucking loony.

192
00:08:27,861 --> 00:08:28,470
But in Florida you can go to like 100 
doctors.

193
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:30,540
You don't,
they don't have a database of doctors.

194
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:33,530
That's crazy.
It's scary shit because it's like,

195
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:38,630
for sure it's pharmaceutical companies.
They absolutely know what the fuck 

196
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:39,840
they're doing with this stuff.
They have,

197
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:44,870
they've been accused and convicted or 
it's been proven rather than they lied 

198
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:45,850
about the,
uh,

199
00:08:45,851 --> 00:08:50,851
the uh,
addiction qualities of Oxycontin that 

200
00:08:50,851 --> 00:08:52,170
they knew and suppressed information.
They knew that it was super,

201
00:08:52,171 --> 00:08:53,040
super addictive.
I mean,

202
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:58,041
it's basically,
it's heroin in a form when they call it 

203
00:08:58,041 --> 00:08:58,230
hillbilly heroin,
that's really what it is.

204
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:04,610
Have you ever been to Florida folks you 
might want to go just to see these 

205
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:06,150
things called pain management centers.
I mean,

206
00:09:06,151 --> 00:09:11,151
you know,
people go on vacation to see like the 

207
00:09:11,151 --> 00:09:13,610
Great Wall of China.
You might want to go on vacation to see 

208
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:13,610
the pain management centers because it's
a fucking trip.

209
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:14,820
Yeah,
it's a heroin store.

210
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,350
Shit's fucked up.
But I mean,

211
00:09:16,351 --> 00:09:18,750
do you think,
did you see her reaction and the video?

212
00:09:18,751 --> 00:09:21,120
Did you see like the light,
she kind of looks,

213
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:22,810
here's,
here's the problem,

214
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,970
here's the problem with both of them,
right?

215
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:27,400
Is I liked both of them.
Can talk about them.

216
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:28,660
I'd like to know.
And,

217
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:29,950
and we,
you know,

218
00:09:29,951 --> 00:09:32,790
I met Jenna back when she was with her 
old husband and she's always been there.

219
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:34,230
She's still with him.
I heard,

220
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:36,120
I heard that it never got a divorce.

221
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,050
Well,
either way,

222
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:40,540
she's always been nice to me and I can't
talk shit about her.

223
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:41,740
But yeah,
it's um,

224
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,300
it's a whole thing is unfortunate.
I'll tell you,

225
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:44,900
I can't talk shit about,
about that,

226
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:47,200
that Faggot,
that was fucking Larry King's wife.

227
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:49,440
Now he's talking about it left and 
right,

228
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:54,600
giving up all the Jews like it was bad 
enough when all these women were coming 

229
00:09:54,941 --> 00:09:59,941
out about tiger woods and then Jesse 
James chicks trying to make her money 

230
00:09:59,941 --> 00:10:01,540
like it's.
That's bad enough,

231
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:07,140
but this fucking guy that's been banging
Larry King's wife is the biggest bitch 

232
00:10:08,051 --> 00:10:10,120
out of all of them.
This fucking guy.

233
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:15,260
Okay.
Was the baseball coach for Larry King's 

234
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:15,260
kids.
Okay.

235
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:19,810
He starts banging Larry King's wife and 
he's banging Larry King's wife and Larry

236
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:24,490
King's bed while Larry King show is 
being filmed because Larry King wants to

237
00:10:24,491 --> 00:10:28,150
know where his wife is at all times,
so he makes sure watch the show at least

238
00:10:28,151 --> 00:10:30,430
according to this guy so he can quiz her
like,

239
00:10:30,431 --> 00:10:32,140
what did you think about like Joe did?

240
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:36,040
I asked Tom Cruise the right questions 
and so she has to be ready to answer.

241
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:40,900
So he's banging her and as he's banging,
she's like watching the show,

242
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,570
making sure she pays attention to what 
you know.

243
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:48,720
Fucking Paris Hilton necessarily large.
This fucking guy gave up everything,

244
00:10:49,721 --> 00:10:53,230
man.
He's such a fucking snitch bitch.

245
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,970
This is a man.
Okay.

246
00:10:54,971 --> 00:10:55,700
This is an,
uh,

247
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:59,380
a wounded female who dated a guy for a 
long time.

248
00:10:59,381 --> 00:11:02,470
He told her he loved her and she thought
that she was going to leave him there.

249
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,660
You know,
that's not what's happening here.

250
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:06,400
This is not a,
this is a man,

251
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:11,580
this is a fucking man.
A man who knew the deal right from the 

252
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:12,430
get go.
And apparently she started buying him.

253
00:11:12,431 --> 00:11:13,810
Shit.
She's,

254
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:15,760
he's a young guy.
Okay.

255
00:11:15,761 --> 00:11:20,260
And she's hot for Larry King.
But this guy was like,

256
00:11:20,261 --> 00:11:21,610
I'm in love with you.
I want to marry you.

257
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:24,970
This fucking guy was doing to her the 
same thing,

258
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,640
rich women due to older men.
The same,

259
00:11:27,641 --> 00:11:28,010
same thing

260
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:29,600
that fucking Larry King's wife was 
doing,

261
00:11:29,601 --> 00:11:34,601
a Larry King.
She was trying to get paid and he was 

262
00:11:34,601 --> 00:11:37,301
trying to get paid to and now he's like,
just spilling the beans for just all 

263
00:11:37,301 --> 00:11:41,861
these magazines and he's talking about 
his acting career and Larry King helped 

264
00:11:41,861 --> 00:11:45,341
him.
So like kind of like Tito's telling the 

265
00:11:45,341 --> 00:11:46,370
mother of his two children that my wife 
is a meth meth head,

266
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,600
you know,
and stuff like that.

267
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:50,390
Now that's kind of like breaking a weird
kind of trust like,

268
00:11:50,391 --> 00:11:55,391
Hey,
the woman that mother your two cheered 

269
00:11:55,391 --> 00:11:55,391
on,
hey,

270
00:11:55,391 --> 00:11:55,391
no,
she's on

271
00:11:55,391 --> 00:11:56,200
Meth,
met Oxycontin,

272
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:57,310
oxycontin or whatever.

273
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:58,380
Well,
yes,

274
00:11:58,381 --> 00:12:00,930
I could see your point,
but if you want to help somebody,

275
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:03,540
maybe that would be the thing to do to 
make it public.

276
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:06,390
If someone's going wacky and accusing 
you of doing shit that you didn't do,

277
00:12:06,391 --> 00:12:11,391
it's telling everybody the whole entire 
world and trying to ruin that person's 

278
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:11,430
telling the whole entire world that 
you're a wife beater.

279
00:12:11,431 --> 00:12:13,150
If that's not true.
Yeah,

280
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,510
but if you have a drug problem and then 
you love that person,

281
00:12:15,511 --> 00:12:16,530
you know that then.
All right,

282
00:12:16,531 --> 00:12:17,430
come on.
You know,

283
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,880
we both know people with drug.
I guess we can't really talk about it,

284
00:12:20,881 --> 00:12:23,070
but we can't talk about people with drug
problems.

285
00:12:23,071 --> 00:12:25,260
But isn't it interesting when someone 
has a drug problem,

286
00:12:25,261 --> 00:12:27,360
like how do you.
Then the interesting question is,

287
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:31,020
and if you don't know anybody that has a
drug problem out there,

288
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:32,160
well how lucky are you?

289
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:37,400
You're so lucky because it's one of the 
satisfying things when you know someone 

290
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:40,881
who's addicted to anything.
I've known people that were addicted to 

291
00:12:40,881 --> 00:12:40,881
gambling,
you know,

292
00:12:40,881 --> 00:12:41,860
I know a lot of dudes that are addicted 
to pussy and that's real.

293
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:42,380
You know,
there's,

294
00:12:42,381 --> 00:12:44,610
there's people that are addicted to 
things so they're not just trying to get

295
00:12:44,611 --> 00:12:45,420
legs,
they're Horny,

296
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:47,610
they're just fucking,
they're obsessive,

297
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:48,750
you know,
and there's,

298
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:52,890
there's drugs that will fucking for sure
take over someone's body.

299
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,080
And what do you do about it?
We've had the problem,

300
00:12:55,081 --> 00:12:57,450
we've had problems with friends of ours,
you know,

301
00:12:57,451 --> 00:12:59,580
like what do you do about it?
My friend Johnny,

302
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:02,450
my best friend growing up,
my good do that.

303
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:04,680
I used to play pool with and hang out 
with in New York.

304
00:13:04,681 --> 00:13:06,140
He died from drugs.
He died.

305
00:13:06,141 --> 00:13:08,480
He was 33 years old.
You know,

306
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:13,940
it could happen to anybody.
Anybody that fucks around with drugs 

307
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:17,140
like Oxycontin's heroin and math and 
stuff like that and coke.

308
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:19,500
You can get caught.
And what do you do?

309
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:20,760
What do you do if your friend gets 
caught?

310
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:22,410
Your rat them out the fuck you do?

311
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:27,730
I don't think writing out,
at least not when you're in a situation 

312
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:30,581
where you're not only writing out to the
whatever authority you're reading them 

313
00:13:30,581 --> 00:13:33,500
out to every single person in the world 
and when you're in a field where you are

314
00:13:33,501 --> 00:13:36,230
based off of your persona,
like you're an extrovert,

315
00:13:36,231 --> 00:13:39,560
she makes money if who she is and she's 
playing a role,

316
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:43,100
you think he fucked up,
but it destroyed her,

317
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:43,850
her,
you know,

318
00:13:43,851 --> 00:13:46,580
tiger woods style with her in front of 
twitter,

319
00:13:46,581 --> 00:13:48,410
in front of everybody,
in front of everything.

320
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,270
Her career and the mother

321
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:53,070
have children.
But if he didn't do that,

322
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,080
let's just say,
let's just play devil's advocate.

323
00:13:55,320 --> 00:14:00,320
If he didn't do that,
so let's say that she just got super 

324
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,160
dramatic and fell down and decided to 
call the cops.

325
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:07,340
Or maybe he grabbed her when she was 
doing something wacky and she fell down 

326
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:07,340
and hurt herself.
Let's just,

327
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:11,121
I don't know if that happened that I'm 
certainly not defending anybody who 

328
00:14:11,121 --> 00:14:12,460
would do anything to a woman.
You know,

329
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:17,510
for no reason like that.
I mean anybody who loses their temper 

330
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:17,510
and physically assaulted women.
I'm not defending that,

331
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:22,170
but I've been in situations where people
have accused me of things that I haven't

332
00:14:22,171 --> 00:14:27,171
done and I know people that have been 
accused of rape and I know you want to 

333
00:14:27,171 --> 00:14:27,171
tell yourself.

334
00:14:27,171 --> 00:14:28,720
Yeah,
let's us to luke.

335
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:30,860
Brian has a great store.
I mean,

336
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:33,180
I'm kind of in the same situation.
Back in the day I,

337
00:14:33,181 --> 00:14:36,350
I dated a girl that was completely 
dominate this a long time ago,

338
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:38,720
10 years ago,
10 years ago.

339
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:43,130
I dated this girl that was a blackout,
crazy drunk like every time,

340
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:48,190
like,
like her parents were drunks since she 

341
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:48,210
was 18.
She black out every day,

342
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:53,290
just drank like boone's like five 
bottles of beer machine when you were 

343
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:54,740
dating.
I would say she was like 22,

344
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:56,480
something like that.
Twenty one,

345
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:57,950
22,
something like that.

346
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:03,310
And uh,
I broke up with her because she uses 

347
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:03,310
when up like on knew like five times a 
day.

348
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:04,430
You're just like,
come on,

349
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:09,470
you still to dig dick out first.
And then.

350
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:11,800
But no,
uh,

351
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:13,420
so once it was,
like,

352
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:18,460
it was always one of the things,
like I break up with her and then I was 

353
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:18,460
like,
Oh God,

354
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:18,460
she has big tits.

355
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:18,460
I got you.
No,

356
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:19,040
no.
Oh I forgot to fuck her again.

357
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,330
But,
but then one time it was like six months

358
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:22,580
go by.
She's trying and trying.

359
00:15:22,581 --> 00:15:23,420
And finally I'm like,
all right,

360
00:15:23,421 --> 00:15:28,421
look,
it's my sister's birthday this weekend 

361
00:15:28,421 --> 00:15:28,421
we're going to go out and have some 
drinks if you want to come out,

362
00:15:28,421 --> 00:15:28,640
but you have to be cool,
you know,

363
00:15:28,641 --> 00:15:29,360
you can't,
you know,

364
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:32,580
whatever.
And so she came out fucking stupid.

365
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:36,680
Let's black out drunk fucking 
embarrassing people,

366
00:15:36,681 --> 00:15:41,681
you know,
I had to like get her in the car and so 

367
00:15:41,681 --> 00:15:41,681
they get back to my house and I'm like,
look,

368
00:15:41,681 --> 00:15:43,960
I'm going to bed.
You can crash downstairs,

369
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:44,780
uh,
or,

370
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:47,870
or I can call you a cab or somebody 
you're not allowed to drive.

371
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,360
She goes,
fucking driving.

372
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:53,290
Start breaking my shit.
Just destroying my house.

373
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:56,560
I'm talking about taking picture frames 
and smashing it,

374
00:15:56,620 --> 00:16:01,620
throwing things.
Like I had this huge dent in my 

375
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:02,150
refrigerator where she threw something 
at my refrigerator like,

376
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,850
and I'm like grabbing her,
like,

377
00:16:03,851 --> 00:16:04,630
stop,
stop,

378
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:07,300
get the fuck out of my house.
You crazy woman.

379
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:10,060
And so I opened the door,
throw her outside.

380
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:11,740
I literally throw,
not like,

381
00:16:11,741 --> 00:16:12,400
hey,
through our,

382
00:16:12,401 --> 00:16:17,401
against a brick wall or anything.
I just like pushed her out the front 

383
00:16:17,401 --> 00:16:17,401
door,
slammed the door,

384
00:16:17,401 --> 00:16:21,030
went upstairs,
went to bed and forgot all about 

385
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:21,590
boulder.
You for.

386
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:23,860
That's a bold move.
I was like,

387
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:28,920
you saw what if you saw the,
the shit that she was doing in my.

388
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,180
I look out the door to see where she 
went or not.

389
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:33,950
I did not care.
I was so upset because my.

390
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:36,910
I assume she would just start lighting 
your house on fire.

391
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:42,210
Yeah,
I think to a point I probably look 

392
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:44,951
outside,
see if like she walked down to her car 

393
00:16:44,951 --> 00:16:44,951
or something like that,
you know?

394
00:16:44,951 --> 00:16:49,260
But what she did was go to my neighbors,
start banging on their door two in the 

395
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:49,260
morning,
go

396
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,460
won't drive me home.

397
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,320
I slept through it.
You have to pay attention.

398
00:16:58,321 --> 00:17:03,321
I slept through all this.
I guess the cops came online,

399
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:05,880
whatever,
and I was just like,

400
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:07,530
I remember.
Then I woke up in the morning,

401
00:17:07,531 --> 00:17:10,730
casually went downstairs making coffee,
get a doorbell,

402
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:12,690
rang the door,
open the door and the go,

403
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:14,130
Hey Brian.
Damn,

404
00:17:14,131 --> 00:17:16,130
we wish you went and answered.
They answered the door.

405
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:18,360
We need to arrest,
you know what?

406
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:23,500
And they're like,
well we got three charges for your 

407
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,001
arrest.
I guess you wouldn't drive her home and 

408
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:31,920
you wouldn't let her leave the house or 
something like that because I wouldn't 

409
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,540
let her drive was unlawful restraint 
because I went in a.

410
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:36,720
When you give her keys,
I want to get her keys.

411
00:17:36,721 --> 00:17:38,670
Gets you with blackout wasted.
Oh,

412
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,190
you should have called the cops.
I should've called the cops.

413
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,180
Yes,
absolutely.

414
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:43,980
But when you're young and.

415
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:44,550
Okay,
so,

416
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,920
so,
so you were falsely to Sorta,

417
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:48,900
you were involved in a fucked up 
situation.

418
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,720
It's basically,
it's a form of Karma.

419
00:17:51,721 --> 00:17:52,280
I mean,
you,

420
00:17:52,281 --> 00:17:57,281
you were involved with someone who 
shouldn't have been involved with your 

421
00:17:57,281 --> 00:17:57,281
instincts,
are telling you to avoid them.

422
00:17:57,281 --> 00:17:58,150
Absolutely.
The Ted sucked.

423
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:01,800
It sucked me right back in.
Like so anyways,

424
00:18:01,801 --> 00:18:06,300
I got all these charges against me and 
then I had to go to court spend,

425
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:09,000
I think it was $20,000
in court fees.

426
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:11,790
I had to go to all these different 
things like I went to this,

427
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:15,750
had to go to a psychiatrist that they 
maybe go to a,

428
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:20,810
and this is by the way all nicknamed the
Oj Simpson Law because after the Oj 

429
00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:22,170
Simpson trial,
they now have it like a woman.

430
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:27,320
If a woman wanted,
she could go through the phone book and 

431
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,241
go arrest this person thing,
hit me and without asking anything or 

432
00:18:29,241 --> 00:18:33,651
anything,
they have to automatically arrest that 

433
00:18:33,651 --> 00:18:33,651
person,
put them in the system.

434
00:18:33,651 --> 00:18:34,560
Oh people this shit.
Just kidding.

435
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:37,050
Ha Ha.
People are gonna Start Anyway.

436
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:40,320
So we're not responsible for anything.
So I just made that up,

437
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:41,920
made that up.
So I.

438
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,460
So I had to go to like the psychiatrist 
and this one person,

439
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:49,580
he was like the deciding factor.
If this person says that they,

440
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:53,040
they believe I'm a crazy woman theater,
they don't have to go to trial.

441
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:56,010
And so we sit down and he goes,
excuse me,

442
00:18:56,011 --> 00:18:58,500
what was the woman's name?
This is in the psychiatrist meeting.

443
00:18:58,501 --> 00:18:59,790
I'm like,
I told her the name and they're like,

444
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:04,940
I'm sorry,
I'm going to have to stop this right 

445
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:04,940
now.
I actually graduated with her.

446
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:06,000
I'm going to have to get my partner in 
on this.

447
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:10,320
And so he could interview me.
And so I think it's like to the partner.

448
00:19:10,321 --> 00:19:10,770
I'm like,
all right,

449
00:19:10,771 --> 00:19:12,550
this is this guy's friend,
you know,

450
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,920
that went to school with this girl.

451
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:15,970
The Guy Sat and listened to me five 
minutes because yes,

452
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:17,880
this does go to trial.
He is out of control.

453
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:19,650
And the whole time I'm like,
I went home,

454
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:21,000
she was going crazy.
I stepped up,

455
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,610
you know?
And so then I had to go to court,

456
00:19:23,611 --> 00:19:25,320
this guy with like the girl or 
something,

457
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:30,350
she went to high school,
they graduated together and singing 

458
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:31,490
class.
So he hooked it up for his friend.

459
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:34,110
Well,
if you work with your partner and you're

460
00:19:34,111 --> 00:19:34,590
like,
Hey,

461
00:19:34,591 --> 00:19:36,750
I went to school with this girl,
fuck this guy up,

462
00:19:36,751 --> 00:19:38,460
you know,
that's probably what happened.

463
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:43,550
So I had to go then go to back to court 
to get the judge to approve like a 

464
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:44,580
separate person.
I have to say,

465
00:19:44,581 --> 00:19:49,581
look,
they went to high school together and 

466
00:19:49,581 --> 00:19:49,581
then they whispered.
So then I had to go to this other view.

467
00:19:49,581 --> 00:19:50,070
You but you got that off.

468
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:51,090
Yeah.
I had to go to court though.

469
00:19:51,091 --> 00:19:51,960
Okay,
next or what?

470
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:54,980
$10,000
or something like that.

471
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:57,120
Then finally what happens?
They dropped everything.

472
00:19:57,390 --> 00:19:59,490
Uh,
this is like $20,000

473
00:19:59,491 --> 00:20:02,340
worth of court fees going to court for 
about two years.

474
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:07,550
They dropped everything for a.
what's that ticket where you can go 

475
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:08,100
outside and just scream outside.
Uh,

476
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:10,980
uh,
it's like a minor ticket.

477
00:20:10,981 --> 00:20:12,780
It's like a $50 tickets during the 
piece.

478
00:20:12,781 --> 00:20:13,710
Yeah.
Disturbing the peace.

479
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:16,320
But it's called something else.
It's called something else.

480
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:19,760
But I got that.
Let's see if any of these fucking.

481
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,320
What's it called?
Degenerates will know what that means.

482
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,520
Uh,
yeah.

483
00:20:24,521 --> 00:20:26,550
But so and so it got all that drop to 
that end.

484
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:28,500
The day Mr Jones,
9:30

485
00:20:28,501 --> 00:20:29,820
says,
let's hear the real story.

486
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,350
You Chris Brown,
that bitch.

487
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,650
No,
I did know.

488
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:36,930
And what's funny is I have a,
a mugshot and in the mug shot,

489
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:41,990
I have a black guy and my nose is all 
fucked up because she throws something 

490
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:44,490
at me and hit me in the face and I 
didn't even know about it.

491
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:47,980
So the moral of the story is,
if you know crazy

492
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,300
bitch,
get the fuck away from me.

493
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:51,320
Disorderly conduct disorder.
Well,

494
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,820
here's the,
here's the funniest thing is,

495
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:54,920
right,
right when I did that,

496
00:20:54,921 --> 00:20:57,350
the next day after the trial where they 
ended it and say,

497
00:20:57,351 --> 00:20:58,370
alright,
disorderly conduct,

498
00:20:58,371 --> 00:20:59,310
pay a ticket.
Uh,

499
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:00,380
she called me.
She goes,

500
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:02,450
I want you to know I'm so sorry about 
this.

501
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:04,700
I actually didn't press charges or 
anything.

502
00:21:04,701 --> 00:21:07,190
The police press charges and they 
wouldn't let me.

503
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:09,010
They wouldn't drop the charges.
The true,

504
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,130
true story.
She's like,

505
00:21:10,131 --> 00:21:12,950
I had nothing to do with this.
I was pissed off that night.

506
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,720
That's all that happened.
I went to the cop.

507
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:16,020
It's so great.
Well,

508
00:21:16,021 --> 00:21:18,690
that's the truth,
that that is a part of the law.

509
00:21:18,691 --> 00:21:21,810
If you get accused of any sort of 
domestic violence,

510
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:25,440
the police have to try the case.
The law has to try the case.

511
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:26,120
Yeah.
He can't.

512
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:29,010
Woman can't just drop it.
You can't drop domestic violent cases.

513
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:30,090
Yeah,
pretty nutty.

514
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,880
When you think about it,
that is the problem.

515
00:21:32,881 --> 00:21:37,881
There's a lot of people that do a lot of
fucked up things to human beings for 

516
00:21:37,881 --> 00:21:37,881
sure.
And there should be last protect people,

517
00:21:37,881 --> 00:21:40,230
but we don't know who's telling the 
fucking truth.

518
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:44,220
And if you run in and bad circles and 
you hang out with crazy bitches,

519
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:45,870
you could have a bad situation.
Right.

520
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:51,480
So that's what sucks about this whole 
thing with them because they're 

521
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:51,480
celebrities.
If all that shoot was on TMZ,

522
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:54,200
Tito and Jenna,
all my shit was on TMZ.

523
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,450
That would be great.

524
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:57,390
People would think that you're a woman 
beater.

525
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:59,700
Yeah.
I've already just told you.

526
00:21:59,701 --> 00:22:01,120
Use.
You're probably half the people there.

527
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:01,830
Think I'm lying

528
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:04,710
your.
I've never had a truck hit me.

529
00:22:04,711 --> 00:22:09,711
I have a check swing on me once and I 
ducked under and grabbed her and then I 

530
00:22:09,711 --> 00:22:10,560
calmed her down and then it got okay 
after that.

531
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:12,410
But I've never,
you know,

532
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,180
never been in a situation where I hated 
somebody worlds with them.

533
00:22:15,181 --> 00:22:17,610
And I hated them,
but I know people have man,

534
00:22:17,611 --> 00:22:20,970
I know people that are in relationships 
with they fucking hate,

535
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:26,420
you know,
and it's almost always people that had 

536
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:28,791
really fucked up parents and it's almost
always people that have parents that 

537
00:22:28,791 --> 00:22:32,991
fought and for some reason they think 
that it's normal and especially when 

538
00:22:32,991 --> 00:22:36,921
you're young,
they kind of like it because they think 

539
00:22:36,921 --> 00:22:37,320
it makes them feel like an adult,
like they're doing like adult type shit.

540
00:22:37,321 --> 00:22:40,410
Like their parents did their fucking 
screaming and yelling at each other.

541
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:43,470
Like there's been many times,
especially when I was way,

542
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:48,500
way younger in my early days for how to 
grip on the type of girls to date type 

543
00:22:48,541 --> 00:22:48,810
of girls.

544
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:51,090
If a girl is hot,
I would date her.

545
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:53,310
It didn't matter if she yelled at me,
demean.

546
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:55,800
You had to be really fucked up for me to
break up with,

547
00:22:55,801 --> 00:23:00,801
you know,
especially in Boston because it's so 

548
00:23:00,801 --> 00:23:03,060
hard to get laid in Boston.
In Boston if you're single,

549
00:23:03,061 --> 00:23:05,450
you fucked.
It's not like too much Stevia.

550
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:06,950
No,
I got all grinds.

551
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,670
I made cowboy coffee.
I make coffee with a French Press and at

552
00:23:11,671 --> 00:23:13,770
the end of it there's,
you get grinds,

553
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:14,860
but I like it.
It's all,

554
00:23:14,861 --> 00:23:16,310
it's gritty,
but what,

555
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:18,690
you know,
it's so hard to get laid,

556
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:23,750
you know,
in Boston and when you're a teenager 

557
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:23,750
man,
especially,

558
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:23,750
I don't know about you,
but me,

559
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:25,800
when I was teaching,
I had to get laid to stay sane.

560
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:30,830
I had to get laid.
Otherwise sex was all I thought about 

561
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:30,830
all fucking day.
You know,

562
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:35,301
nature has you primed for that nature,
has it set up so that if you're not 

563
00:23:35,301 --> 00:23:37,800
fucking okay and if you like 17,
18 years old and you're not fucking,

564
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:39,210
that's all you're going to be thinking 
about.

565
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:44,210
You're not gonna be able to concentrate 
on anything and you can get distracted 

566
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:47,301
so easy.
You could get registered completely 

567
00:23:47,301 --> 00:23:47,930
removed from whatever path you're on.
If you're trying to,

568
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:53,020
you know,
become a fucking sprinter and the 

569
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:53,020
Olympics are you trying to,
you know,

570
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:54,110
become an author.
Whatever you're doing,

571
00:23:54,111 --> 00:23:58,310
if you're not getting laid,
a girl can come in and just just fuck up

572
00:23:58,311 --> 00:24:02,160
the whole situation just by giving you 
pussy that others.

573
00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:07,530
But when you know you're 30 something 
years old and you've been around the 

574
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:08,180
block a few times,
then then it becomes a matter of,

575
00:24:08,181 --> 00:24:09,710
okay,
who's the dummy here?

576
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:11,690
You know,
who's the one who's being silly?

577
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:12,560
You know,
why?

578
00:24:12,561 --> 00:24:14,300
Why are you getting involved with these 
crazy bitches?

579
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:17,540
This is one people need to do you.
First of all,

580
00:24:17,541 --> 00:24:20,120
you need to get your own shit together.
That's like number one.

581
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,370
You need to be a happy person and you 
know,

582
00:24:22,371 --> 00:24:25,820
a lot of people don't like weed,
but here's one thing that we'd is really

583
00:24:25,821 --> 00:24:30,821
good for.
If you smoke weed and get paranoid and 

584
00:24:30,821 --> 00:24:33,851
you start freaking out about things,
almost always those things that you 

585
00:24:33,851 --> 00:24:37,750
freaking out about are things that are 
in your subconscious that you're not 

586
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:41,141
comfortable about.
The things that had been bothering you 

587
00:24:41,141 --> 00:24:43,571
for a long time and you've been trying 
to push them to the back of your head 

588
00:24:43,571 --> 00:24:44,200
and when you smoke pot,
whatever it is about pot,

589
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:46,150
especially when you get too hot,
what?

590
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:51,190
There's some,
there's a quality to marijuana that 

591
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:52,010
makes you think about shit that you're 
suppressing.

592
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:54,980
It makes you think about things from 
your past that you don't like.

593
00:24:55,190 --> 00:25:00,190
It makes you think about like things 
that you did and it makes you think 

594
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:00,770
about like your own issues,
you know,

595
00:25:00,771 --> 00:25:04,880
and especially like marijuana and the 
isolation tank together too.

596
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:06,020
You haven't even used my tag.

597
00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:08,360
Have you done the isolation tank lately?
Have you been still doing?

598
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:10,520
Yeah,
I always do it.

599
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Want to do it last night,
but I was too tired to get up early in 

600
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:16,000
the morning and do radio for Montreal.
I'm in Montreal.

601
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,921
I'm May 8th.
I believe something like that at the 

602
00:25:21,441 --> 00:25:25,480
metropolis is that may.
The was in May,

603
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,390
May.
It might be seventh or eight.

604
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:28,880
Will show I find out.
I probably.

605
00:25:28,881 --> 00:25:29,210
Sure.

606
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,140
By the way,
your twitter name is now.

607
00:25:31,141 --> 00:25:32,480
Joe Rogan.
Yes.

608
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:34,910
So it's not Joe Rogan.net
anymore?

609
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:36,160
Yeah,
there was a,

610
00:25:36,161 --> 00:25:40,150
I a fucking scored.
I got it back.

611
00:25:40,151 --> 00:25:41,950
There is apparently a thing where you 
can,

612
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:43,950
where you can,
um,

613
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:47,110
a report when people are hijacking your 
image,

614
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:52,390
squatting your name.
You know what's funny is that when they 

615
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:54,350
switch it over,
they just deleted Joe's Joe Rogan.net

616
00:25:54,351 --> 00:25:56,600
name,
so they just let it free again,

617
00:25:56,690 --> 00:25:59,340
like so he could get a.
and so I grabbed,

618
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,340
I noticed it right away and I grabbed 
it,

619
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:03,220
but I didn't tell John looked at him 
like that

620
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:05,420
motherfucker.
Somebody got my shit.

621
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:09,290
So I sent an email thing to them,
a message to them saying,

622
00:26:09,291 --> 00:26:11,180
Hey,
I will give you a,

623
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,390
uh,
an autograph DVD and a cd if you give me

624
00:26:14,391 --> 00:26:14,750
that.

625
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:16,930
I say the play that long.
But I was like,

626
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:19,540
I know how much you do practical jokes 
that was even going to do it.

627
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,290
But it's funny because I don't know if 
you looked at the photo,

628
00:26:23,291 --> 00:26:25,180
if you go to [inaudible] dot net now in 
the twitter,

629
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:28,180
if you look at the photo made his head 
more tilted so it looked gay or.

630
00:26:28,181 --> 00:26:30,010
So you've been working with this.
It'd be like what?

631
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:33,220
Uh,
I got it.

632
00:26:33,221 --> 00:26:34,520
It's uh,
May 7th,

633
00:26:34,850 --> 00:26:37,340
May 7th.
I'm in a metropolis in Montreal.

634
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:42,580
So anyway,
we were talking about having crazy 

635
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:42,580
people in your life and sex and 
isolation tanks,

636
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:45,390
isolation tanks and get well about 
having good,

637
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,990
good relationships like the best way to,
to have a good relationship.

638
00:26:48,991 --> 00:26:51,000
You've got to be comfortable with who 
the fuck you are,

639
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:52,920
you know,
and if you've got a lot of issues,

640
00:26:52,921 --> 00:26:57,921
a lot of stuff that's bothering you,
you know that's going to fuck up any 

641
00:26:57,921 --> 00:26:59,640
chance you have of communicating well 
with other people because as soon as you

642
00:26:59,641 --> 00:27:02,190
get comfortable with another person,
when you first meet someone,

643
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:07,340
you don't really let them in and you 
sort of project who you want to be to 

644
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:08,310
this person and then the person does the
same thing to you.

645
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:10,230
But after like a few months or few 
weeks,

646
00:27:10,231 --> 00:27:10,830
depending on,
you know,

647
00:27:10,831 --> 00:27:12,000
how good your act is.

648
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:14,160
Most people,
you get to know who the fuck they really

649
00:27:14,161 --> 00:27:16,470
are and what their real issues are.
You know,

650
00:27:16,471 --> 00:27:18,900
after awhile there and they start 
yelling at you and they get upset at you

651
00:27:18,901 --> 00:27:21,750
for no reason or something and you start
tuning it all in and going,

652
00:27:21,751 --> 00:27:22,260
oh,
okay,

653
00:27:22,261 --> 00:27:24,240
you're a fucking bananas.
You know,

654
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:27,680
you've got to not be bananas in order to
get someone who's not banana.

655
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:29,430
It's like people will do is we'll always
say like,

656
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:31,680
man,
I'm fucking trying to find a good girl,

657
00:27:31,681 --> 00:27:32,300
Dude.
I'm just tired.

658
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:33,450
All these bitches.
Meanwhile,

659
00:27:33,451 --> 00:27:35,410
you're a mess bro.
You're a fucking man.

660
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:37,680
You're a loon.
You hate your Stepdad,

661
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:40,150
you know you want to fucking beat dude's
up at stoplights,

662
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:43,500
you know you're a mess.
And unless you stop being a mess,

663
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:45,840
you're never going to be involved in a 
good relationship.

664
00:27:45,841 --> 00:27:48,510
You never got to be able to recognize,
you know,

665
00:27:48,511 --> 00:27:49,680
other people that are fucked up.

666
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:54,710
Like I've always said that one of the 
things about trying to be like super 

667
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:57,180
honest and I try to be literally as 
honest as possible,

668
00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:02,300
like it sounds really kind of gay,
but I really do try to very important 

669
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:02,300
things.
One,

670
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:06,420
I try to be as nice to people as 
possible and be as nice as possible.

671
00:28:06,421 --> 00:28:11,421
I wish I could be nice to everybody,
but some people are fucking obsessive 

672
00:28:11,421 --> 00:28:11,421
and they don't leave you alone or the 
bananas or they're,

673
00:28:11,421 --> 00:28:16,371
they're retarded or their abusive or you
try to take advantage of you if you're 

674
00:28:16,371 --> 00:28:17,040
nice and there's some people that you 
can't be nice to.

675
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:20,970
Unfortunately there's some people that 
you know what they need fucking years of

676
00:28:20,971 --> 00:28:22,360
therapy and when you run into them,
you,

677
00:28:22,361 --> 00:28:24,110
you don't have the time for that.
So you've got to go through,

678
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,590
leave me the fuck alone,
stop,

679
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:26,190
you know.

680
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:31,190
And,
and it's unfortunate you have to do 

681
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:31,190
that,
but sometimes you have to do that.

682
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:32,790
So I try to be as nice as is humanly 
possible to get through my life.

683
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:38,060
And number two,
I try to be as honest as humanly 

684
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:38,060
possible.
I try to always be honest.

685
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:39,410
I try to,
uh,

686
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:44,750
make sure that everything I'm doing,
I'm doing from a place where I can be 

687
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:45,570
honest about it.
And if you can't be honest about it,

688
00:28:45,571 --> 00:28:46,920
for the most part,
it's one thing,

689
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:50,880
just one thing is being honest.
Another thing is like tmz type shit,

690
00:28:50,881 --> 00:28:55,881
like revealing all sorts of information 
about your personal life because people 

691
00:28:55,881 --> 00:28:55,881
are creepy and they want to look,
look into it.

692
00:28:55,881 --> 00:29:00,020
That's not honestly,
that's like a revealing thing and I'm 

693
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:00,390
not really into that.
I'm not really into like becoming,

694
00:29:00,391 --> 00:29:02,880
going on a reality show and having 
everybody seemed my bathroom,

695
00:29:02,881 --> 00:29:04,290
like what the fuck is that?

696
00:29:04,290 --> 00:29:05,790
That's not honesty,
that's just,

697
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:08,660
that's just weird voyeuristic shit that 
people get,

698
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:09,930
you know,
obsessed with.

699
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:11,940
But,
but you know,

700
00:29:11,941 --> 00:29:16,941
what I am into is telling you where I'm 
really coming from and what's going on 

701
00:29:16,941 --> 00:29:17,390
in my own mind and,
and,

702
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:22,440
and be comfortable with that to the 
point where I am so honest all the time 

703
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,240
that I can recognize deception like 
right away,

704
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:25,560
you know,
and I,

705
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:28,680
I find that to be really true.
Like if you're a really honest person,

706
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:31,790
when people are full of Shit,
you just fucking spot it.

707
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:36,800
Like right away.
It's really difficult to lie to an 

708
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:39,861
honest person really hard.
Remember that we did we videos

709
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:46,640
for awhile after every video,
but I was going and it really,

710
00:29:46,641 --> 00:29:51,641
it's fucking awesome philosophy.
Me and Eddie Bravo would have a 

711
00:29:51,641 --> 00:29:51,641
competition.
Who did it?

712
00:29:51,641 --> 00:29:54,810
Best member tried to know I can do 
better.

713
00:29:56,130 --> 00:29:58,300
What was that all about?
At least crazy.

714
00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:00,800
Very competitive.
Very competitive,

715
00:30:00,870 --> 00:30:02,860
very competitive.
I guess you have to be when you do that.

716
00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:03,570
Yeah.
Well,

717
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:05,880
you know,
he grew up in a situation where he had a

718
00:30:05,881 --> 00:30:10,881
Douche bag for a stepfather and his 
whole life has been trying to fight 

719
00:30:10,881 --> 00:30:11,610
against people that are fucking with 
him.

720
00:30:11,970 --> 00:30:13,560
You know what I mean?
So like he'd become,

721
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:15,600
he became hyper competitive because of 
that.

722
00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:18,360
Anyway,
so that's my advice.

723
00:30:18,361 --> 00:30:19,530
And to uh,
that,

724
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:24,580
that bitch ass dude that's banging Larry
King's wife and running your mouth,

725
00:30:25,501 --> 00:30:28,350
you faggot.
Turn in your man card,

726
00:30:28,351 --> 00:30:33,351
you little bitch of the man.
That's how you're getting by in this 

727
00:30:33,351 --> 00:30:36,741
life.
You're getting your money from ratting 

728
00:30:36,741 --> 00:30:36,960
out some woman that you fucked on her 
husband's bed.

729
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:41,070
You silly man.
You silly silly man.

730
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,690
And apparently Larry King,
it helped.

731
00:30:42,691 --> 00:30:45,510
This guy had gotten this guy like acting
gigs,

732
00:30:45,511 --> 00:30:46,890
like,
keep your mouth shut,

733
00:30:46,891 --> 00:30:48,060
son.
You know why?

734
00:30:48,061 --> 00:30:53,061
Trying to hurt Larry King.
What are you getting like 10 grand out 

735
00:30:53,061 --> 00:30:53,061
of this.
You little faggot.

736
00:30:53,061 --> 00:30:54,750
How much have you gotten?
How much are they going to pay that guy?

737
00:30:55,440 --> 00:31:00,270
He's probably doing it for the fame to 
be Spencer Pratt style.

738
00:31:00,271 --> 00:31:04,020
You know there's a sitcoms or it takes 
all these people called man carbon.

739
00:31:04,021 --> 00:31:05,820
They try to earn their man card back,
you know,

740
00:31:05,821 --> 00:31:08,520
or as expensive practice guy and they 
all live in a house together.

741
00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:11,110
The sprints or pat is a fucking 
Brazilian Jiu Jitsu black belt.

742
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:12,680
There's no man.
Exactly.

743
00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:16,400
I've seen him on the show in black belt 
and it's hilarious.

744
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:19,580
I hate that shit.
I hate that.

745
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:21,310
Look,
we're talking about him.

746
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,270
That's all he wants.
And He.

747
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,460
Meanwhile I was making a living and 
those who have to work at 7:11.

748
00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:26,680
If you watch the show.
Sixteen and pregnant.

749
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:27,820
No,
I haven't dude.

750
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,220
Apparently Eddie Bravo says,
I must wash this.

751
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:32,170
I'm to write this down.
Bad Girls Club.

752
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:35,330
Apparently bad girls club is ridiculous.
Yeah,

753
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:39,700
I mean it's just like the motto like 16 
and pregnant even more or something.

754
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:42,190
It was that big keeps coming on.
Uh,

755
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:44,290
whatever.
Um,

756
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:46,600
so what does the show?
16 and pregnant 16.

757
00:31:46,610 --> 00:31:47,260
The pregnancy

758
00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:52,370
one episode and it's all white trash 
kids and they're yelling at their 

759
00:31:52,370 --> 00:31:52,600
parents.
Their parents are yelling at them.

760
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:53,430
I was like,
I don't want it.

761
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,090
It's awful.
It's the worst show ever.

762
00:31:55,091 --> 00:31:57,550
That's like too much info.
That's a perfect example.

763
00:31:57,670 --> 00:32:00,820
We were an Ikea though the other day and
they had like a kid's room,

764
00:32:00,821 --> 00:32:02,920
like it was like a bunk bed and he was 
really happy,

765
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:05,470
but then there was like a place for a 
baby and I'm like,

766
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:07,030
wait,
is this just like,

767
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:12,070
you know,
a poor person with only one bedroom and 

768
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:12,580
had this shared like sister and baby,
or is this like,

769
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:15,460
now this girl has a baby and she's like 
15.

770
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:18,130
It was the big bulk of it.
It's just got a crib thing.

771
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:19,810
That's what I'm saying.
I'm like,

772
00:32:19,811 --> 00:32:24,811
what is Ikea doing doing?
I think they're just trying to maximize 

773
00:32:24,811 --> 00:32:24,811
bedroom,
bedroom,

774
00:32:25,330 --> 00:32:28,530
trying to market to them.
This is like,

775
00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:30,880
oh yeah,
this is like for too many people,

776
00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:33,070
Mexicans living in an apartment or 
something like that,

777
00:32:33,071 --> 00:32:33,370
you know?

778
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:34,910
Yeah.
Well,

779
00:32:34,911 --> 00:32:39,911
you know what man,
with this economy being in the shitter 

780
00:32:39,911 --> 00:32:42,401
the way it is,
people are stack and more people into 

781
00:32:42,401 --> 00:32:45,250
houses together.
I know a person who lives down the 

782
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:45,810
street from me is losing their house,
losing people,

783
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:47,030
losing their houses,
left and Ryan.

784
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:47,790
People who,
uh,

785
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:51,590
have a really high falutin lifestyle and
spend tons of money and you know,

786
00:32:51,591 --> 00:32:56,591
get used to it and get used to trying to
bling bling and then the shit hits the 

787
00:32:56,591 --> 00:32:59,981
fan.
I was thinking about moving the other 

788
00:32:59,981 --> 00:33:01,811
day.
Just get sick of a place and you just 

789
00:33:01,811 --> 00:33:01,811
want to upgrade.
You always feel like you have to upgrade

790
00:33:01,811 --> 00:33:01,811
your shit.
Oh,

791
00:33:01,811 --> 00:33:06,790
it's out.
All my carpet have wood floors 

792
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:06,790
underneath it now.
It looks great.

793
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:06,790
Now I'm like,
I'm fine.

794
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:07,340
Yeah,
you just needed a change.

795
00:33:07,341 --> 00:33:08,200
I think,
you know,

796
00:33:08,210 --> 00:33:13,210
when I moved to Colorado that was a good
thing for me to adjust to change 

797
00:33:13,210 --> 00:33:13,210
environments.

798
00:33:13,210 --> 00:33:16,940
I think changing is good for your brain.
I think it like refine your brand,

799
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,940
but your brand has to learn this whole 
new environment.

800
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:22,160
I had a whole new friends,
the people I run into,

801
00:33:22,161 --> 00:33:23,450
a Jujitsu,
whole new people.

802
00:33:23,451 --> 00:33:26,900
I was meeting a whole new comedy clubs 
where I was working on my stuff.

803
00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:30,500
It was a very interesting to me and made
me fire my brain up.

804
00:33:30,530 --> 00:33:33,320
I think that's a good thing to do if a 
shock it once.

805
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:38,710
The problem is.
The other thing is you build a base 

806
00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:38,710
though.
Like I have a base in la.

807
00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:41,510
I have all my friends live in La,
my wife's friends live in La.

808
00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:46,570
You know,
I have my whole system set up where I 

809
00:33:46,570 --> 00:33:46,570
buy my dog food.
I have,

810
00:33:46,570 --> 00:33:47,390
you know,
the guy that works on my car.

811
00:33:47,391 --> 00:33:50,990
You know what I mean?
I have all this shit in la where I train

812
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:52,790
all the dudes that have been training 
with for years.

813
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:58,000
It's like you get like,
you get real comfortable with that 

814
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,511
system and it's very convenient and when
you move you gotta like re reconfigure 

815
00:34:01,511 --> 00:34:04,640
your whole situation.
The problem is women,

816
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:06,350
you know,
you're bringing women and then they have

817
00:34:06,351 --> 00:34:07,970
friends like chocolate Dale said.
He goes,

818
00:34:07,971 --> 00:34:10,010
I can go to a sports bar.
I'll never fucking hour.

819
00:34:10,011 --> 00:34:14,660
I've got nine new friends,
Chili because he's a fucking coolest guy

820
00:34:14,661 --> 00:34:16,370
ever.
He's super friendly.

821
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,260
He's like,
yeah,

822
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:19,220
come on by.
A very cliquey and beers and some guy.

823
00:34:19,221 --> 00:34:20,660
What do you do?
I'm fucking plumber.

824
00:34:20,661 --> 00:34:21,310
Hey,
you know,

825
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,430
I'm,
I'm this,

826
00:34:22,431 --> 00:34:24,890
I'm that and guys can meet guys like 
that.

827
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:28,130
You know,
like I tell the story about the one time

828
00:34:28,131 --> 00:34:30,800
that I hosted a Jack and Jill Strip club
and,

829
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:32,570
and Rhode Island.
I've told you the story before,

830
00:34:32,571 --> 00:34:33,650
right?
Yes.

831
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:37,980
It was a male and a woman stripper,
and it was horrific.

832
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:39,620
There were,
there were both disgusting.

833
00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:44,770
There was like maybe,
maybe six to 10 people in the audience 

834
00:34:44,770 --> 00:34:46,580
at most during the whole night's 
performance and I had to perform a bunch

835
00:34:46,581 --> 00:34:51,581
of times.
I would go up and do stand up and then 

836
00:34:51,581 --> 00:34:51,581
the male stripper would go on.
I'll go up and do standup in.

837
00:34:51,581 --> 00:34:53,240
A female strip would go on and they 
would do shifts and they would take some

838
00:34:53,241 --> 00:34:58,241
time off and then I'll go on stage again
and then they would start to show all 

839
00:34:58,241 --> 00:35:00,911
over again and the woman would go up and
the guy will go do everyone in the 

840
00:35:00,911 --> 00:35:01,750
audience was like these weird people 
from this area,

841
00:35:01,770 --> 00:35:02,930
woonsocket,
Rhode Island,

842
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:06,920
but there was this one dude who was 
there who was a construction worker from

843
00:35:06,921 --> 00:35:11,921
New Jersey and he just happened to be in
town because it was a marriage or 

844
00:35:11,921 --> 00:35:15,521
something like that or wedding that he 
had to go to for when someone's family 

845
00:35:15,521 --> 00:35:15,521
and he was bored.

846
00:35:15,521 --> 00:35:16,250
So we've got out of the house to go have
a appear.

847
00:35:16,251 --> 00:35:21,251
There's a bar down the street,
so he goes to this Jack and Jill Strip 

848
00:35:21,251 --> 00:35:22,790
club and he was a totally normal dude 
and me and him were talking having beers

849
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:23,450
like what?
He goes,

850
00:35:23,451 --> 00:35:25,840
what the fuck are we witnessing?
Or You at least seen?

851
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:27,860
And this was like one normal dude in 
May.

852
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:33,130
After first two beers.
It's like I had known this dude for 

853
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:33,650
fucking 10 years,
were just joining one place to pull.

854
00:35:33,651 --> 00:35:34,730
Yeah,
let's fucking play some pool.

855
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:36,290
So there's a little corn operated pool 
table.

856
00:35:36,291 --> 00:35:38,490
Were playing pool,
making fun of the whole situation.

857
00:35:38,491 --> 00:35:41,850
Like I found a friend like for girls.
That's hard to do,

858
00:35:41,851 --> 00:35:43,650
man.
Bitches don't trust each other.

859
00:35:43,651 --> 00:35:45,660
Man.
I learned that from having dogs.

860
00:35:45,870 --> 00:35:50,870
You know,
having pitbulls I had two female pit 

861
00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:50,870
bulls and one of them killed the other 
one.

862
00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:55,430
They would.
They would fight and I would separate 

863
00:35:55,430 --> 00:35:55,500
them and I thought they worked their 
shit out because the way dogs work,

864
00:35:55,501 --> 00:36:00,501
the shit out.
His one dog will dominate the other dog 

865
00:36:00,501 --> 00:36:00,570
and then you figure out who the Alpha 
is.

866
00:36:00,571 --> 00:36:05,571
They have to do that.
They have to figure out who gets to 

867
00:36:05,571 --> 00:36:05,571
drink first.
Who gets to eat first?

868
00:36:05,571 --> 00:36:06,420
That's just the wild animal world and 
you have to be number one.

869
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:08,460
That's why you can never let your dog 
get away with Shit.

870
00:36:08,610 --> 00:36:10,470
You can never let her get a dog growl at
you.

871
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:15,550
You can never let your dog do things 
they're not supposed to do because you 

872
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:15,550
have to be the Alpha,
especially if you have big dogs.

873
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:17,490
Well,
this is what doesn't work with females.

874
00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:22,790
Females never accept dominance.
They would always come back and try to 

875
00:36:22,790 --> 00:36:25,971
battle it out again and that's what they
did until one of them killed the other 

876
00:36:25,971 --> 00:36:29,391
one.
And I think that's how women are with 

877
00:36:29,391 --> 00:36:29,391
women.
Men.

878
00:36:29,391 --> 00:36:32,570
I think women can be friends with women 
and they have really close friends and 

879
00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:36,621
you know,
they go all sex in the city and pal 

880
00:36:36,621 --> 00:36:36,960
around together and shit like that.
But it's real difficult for them to make

881
00:36:36,961 --> 00:36:40,550
that kind of a bond to trust another 
woman that trust them.

882
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:41,060
This,
it's,

883
00:36:41,310 --> 00:36:43,260
I think it's easier for dudes,
you know?

884
00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:44,250
Yeah,
I agree.

885
00:36:44,290 --> 00:36:46,650
I,
it seems like that's like the cat fight.

886
00:36:46,910 --> 00:36:51,910
Yeah.
Especially if there's dudes that are 

887
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:52,050
like doing stuff that you like to do,
like comics,

888
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:55,510
like if I made comics,
I can go to a new town and uh,

889
00:36:55,530 --> 00:37:00,530
you know,
do stand up or there's some local 

890
00:37:00,530 --> 00:37:02,001
complex.
I'm fucking meet local comics all the 

891
00:37:02,001 --> 00:37:02,001
time.
Next thing you know,

892
00:37:02,001 --> 00:37:02,001
we're out having a beer together.
You know,

893
00:37:02,001 --> 00:37:06,890
we're hanging around.
We have something in common or Jujitsu 

894
00:37:06,890 --> 00:37:09,690
guys like there's like fucking 10 dudes 
in Jujitsu that are trained with all the

895
00:37:09,691 --> 00:37:14,691
time.
There could totally be good friends of 

896
00:37:14,691 --> 00:37:14,691
mine.
They're just dudes that,

897
00:37:14,691 --> 00:37:19,010
especially Jujitsu guys,
because they have good control over the 

898
00:37:19,010 --> 00:37:19,010
ego.
You know,

899
00:37:19,010 --> 00:37:19,620
Jujitsu guys into to get good at 
Jujitsu,

900
00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:22,980
you have to battle it out all the time 
and you have to be real objective.

901
00:37:22,981 --> 00:37:27,981
You can't be delusional at Jujitsu.
You have to really know what your 

902
00:37:27,981 --> 00:37:28,590
strengths are,
what your weaknesses are,

903
00:37:28,591 --> 00:37:30,360
and you've got to be able to deal with 
tapping out.

904
00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:35,390
You've got to be able to deal with dudes
dominating you because in the beginning 

905
00:37:35,390 --> 00:37:36,420
for sure you're going to get dominated.
Everybody gets dominated the beginning.

906
00:37:36,421 --> 00:37:41,421
Nobody,
unless you're just so big that nobody 

907
00:37:41,421 --> 00:37:41,421
can touch you.
So I'm 300 pounds,

908
00:37:41,421 --> 00:37:45,261
brock lesnar character,
you know you're going to get tapped out 

909
00:37:45,261 --> 00:37:47,751
at the beginning,
so you have to have the kind of ego to 

910
00:37:47,751 --> 00:37:47,751
deal with that.
But for,

911
00:37:47,751 --> 00:37:47,751
for women,
I don't know,

912
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:50,880
I think it's much more difficult.
It was really difficult for my wife,

913
00:37:50,881 --> 00:37:55,881
especially when you have a little baby 
and what are you going to meet some 

914
00:37:55,881 --> 00:37:56,640
other lady as a baby and how much you 
going to have in common with this broad.

915
00:37:56,680 --> 00:38:01,680
Once she's Christian,
she goes all loony toon Janya and wants 

916
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:01,680
to fucking talk about Noah's Ark and 
shit.

917
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:03,480
You know?
Right.

918
00:38:03,481 --> 00:38:08,481
Yeah.
I got some guy fucking cornered me at 

919
00:38:08,481 --> 00:38:08,481
the supermarket the other day.
Some do that.

920
00:38:08,481 --> 00:38:10,200
I guess I had met them before,
but I forgot.

921
00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:15,410
You know,
there's some law that you can only or 

922
00:38:15,410 --> 00:38:18,230
there's some studies that say that you 
can only keep like 150 people that you 

923
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:18,810
know in your head.
And we've seen that.

924
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:19,850
No,
I haven't seen that.

925
00:38:19,851 --> 00:38:24,050
But I totally believe it because I think
mine's like 10 says,

926
00:38:24,930 --> 00:38:28,910
well let's meet or I just don't care.
There's so many things when,

927
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:29,800
when like,
you know,

928
00:38:29,801 --> 00:38:34,100
like I'll meet somebody or somebody 
tells me something if I don't care about

929
00:38:34,101 --> 00:38:34,550
it.
I just like,

930
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:38,710
I put that on the coffee table and 
that's about to be thrown out,

931
00:38:38,770 --> 00:38:41,530
you know,
putting my deep storage.

932
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:43,930
I put in my random memory,
you know?

933
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,200
Yeah.
Here it is.

934
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:48,690
This,
there's a,

935
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:51,030
I don't know,
working memory.

936
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,380
There's,
there's a,

937
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:58,420
I'm trying to find it on Google.
I don't want to waste too much time 

938
00:38:58,420 --> 00:38:58,420
looking for this,
but 100,

939
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:02,390
it's apparently you can only remember.
You can only have real relationships 

940
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:04,200
where you know,
150 people were,

941
00:39:04,201 --> 00:39:06,150
you know,
their name and you know,

942
00:39:06,151 --> 00:39:11,151
you'll have a certain amount of space in
your hard drive when it comes to human 

943
00:39:11,151 --> 00:39:14,871
beings.
And that to me reinforces my feelings 

944
00:39:14,871 --> 00:39:15,810
that human beings are supposed to live 
in small tribes.

945
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:20,840
We're not supposed to live and have a 
gigantic fucking tribes of hundreds of 

946
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:21,600
millions of people.

947
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:22,740
Well,
it's also if you,

948
00:39:22,741 --> 00:39:24,600
if you ever get assignment says you 
know,

949
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,890
like you know where you follow the 
colors,

950
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:28,960
but it also is a.
I don't know if it's a.

951
00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:32,470
we're supposed to live in small tribes 
as in if I can do.

952
00:39:32,471 --> 00:39:35,530
Simon says,
but right up to the 14th one,

953
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:39,190
my brain falls off and it's always like 
the 14th one.

954
00:39:39,191 --> 00:39:41,500
It's almost like,
that's just my Max,

955
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:43,360
you know,
like that's my heart is full.

956
00:39:43,450 --> 00:39:47,350
I can't do anything past this 14.
I might be able to train myself to,

957
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:50,800
to like micromanage how many things I 
can remember.

958
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,330
But uh,
it's weird,

959
00:39:52,331 --> 00:39:54,400
like if I pick up a Simon says right 
now,

960
00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:56,590
once I hit the 14th one,
I can't do it.

961
00:39:56,650 --> 00:39:57,760
Like,
just turns off.

962
00:39:57,761 --> 00:40:00,220
Almost everybody has a different 
threshold for.

963
00:40:00,470 --> 00:40:02,410
Oh,
I'm saying everyone does the same for,

964
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:03,670
uh,
for names.

965
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:05,100
It's pretty.
It's pretty.

966
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,730
Wouldn't that fall into the same thing 
though?

967
00:40:06,731 --> 00:40:08,500
Just maybe memory,
memory.

968
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:09,410
Well,
I think,

969
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:11,090
um,
I think,

970
00:40:11,091 --> 00:40:12,800
well think about how many words you 
know,

971
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:18,360
you know,
we know thousands of words and words 

972
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:18,360
that we don't even use.
You know,

973
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:18,360
you can.
I mean,

974
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:21,260
you know,
some of these serendipitous.

975
00:40:21,350 --> 00:40:22,590
Yeah.
That takes up more of our,

976
00:40:22,610 --> 00:40:25,150
most of our hard drives.
Scenario art take scenario.

977
00:40:26,450 --> 00:40:26,660
People

978
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:28,940
that just spout out you only use five 
percent of your brain.

979
00:40:28,970 --> 00:40:33,970
So some random night,
the only use 10 percent of Israeli 

980
00:40:33,970 --> 00:40:36,930
really to you.
Do you even know what the fuck you're 

981
00:40:36,930 --> 00:40:38,561
talking about?
Are you just like reciting some shit 

982
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:38,561
that someone told you in high school?
Like this is the year of Glute,

983
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:38,710
right?
Right.

984
00:40:38,730 --> 00:40:41,490
And that's supposed to be just saying 
we'll use two percent of our Ra,

985
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,190
you know,
you don't fucking know.

986
00:40:43,430 --> 00:40:44,540
But uh,
anyway,

987
00:40:44,541 --> 00:40:46,430
this dude that I met at the grocery 
store,

988
00:40:46,431 --> 00:40:49,700
I did not remember him.
He said he is from Jujitsu.

989
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:50,420
So I said,
hey,

990
00:40:50,421 --> 00:40:51,530
what's up man?
How you doing?

991
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,600
So I think it's just going to be one of 
those casual.

992
00:40:53,601 --> 00:40:54,860
What's up man,
how you doing things?

993
00:40:54,870 --> 00:40:59,870
And,
and he's like a little taken aback that 

994
00:40:59,870 --> 00:41:00,170
I don't remember him.
And then he'll like laugh.

995
00:41:00,171 --> 00:41:01,940
So I was a girl,
awkward socially.

996
00:41:01,970 --> 00:41:03,590
So take care of my,
some shopping.

997
00:41:03,591 --> 00:41:08,591
I'm doing all my shit and then I'm 
leaving and when I'm going out to my 

998
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:11,570
car,
he hits me with Joe,

999
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:13,940
you go to church.
I'm like,

1000
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:17,750
Oh you motherfucker and I've got a car 
and you know,

1001
00:41:17,770 --> 00:41:22,770
unload my food.
I don't want to get the fuck home and 

1002
00:41:22,770 --> 00:41:22,770
this dude is like cornered me in the 
parking lot,

1003
00:41:22,770 --> 00:41:23,650
and so I,
uh,

1004
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:24,200
I say,
no,

1005
00:41:24,201 --> 00:41:25,160
I don't.
He said,

1006
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:26,270
are you interested?
And I say,

1007
00:41:26,271 --> 00:41:26,870
no,
I'm not.

1008
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:29,570
And he goes,
have you talked to blank?

1009
00:41:29,571 --> 00:41:33,110
And I don't want to say who blank is,
but he is a friend of mine.

1010
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,260
And uh,
he was saying that this,

1011
00:41:35,261 --> 00:41:37,190
this guy.
Has He talked to you about the Lord,

1012
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:41,450
this guy is fucking this guy who we're 
talking about this friend of mine,

1013
00:41:41,451 --> 00:41:43,550
his fucking bananas.
All right.

1014
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:44,990
Uh,
you know,

1015
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:46,190
nothing wrong with cheating on your 
wife,

1016
00:41:46,191 --> 00:41:49,490
but this guy like literally was planning
on killing her.

1017
00:41:49,490 --> 00:41:50,560
I mean,
he's fucking brilliant.

1018
00:41:50,570 --> 00:41:51,320
Yeah,
it's crazy.

1019
00:41:51,321 --> 00:41:56,321
He didn't do anything,
let me go away with her and the whole 

1020
00:41:56,321 --> 00:41:58,751
day.
But this guy who was talking about was 

1021
00:41:58,751 --> 00:41:58,751
like,
I don't want to say anything other than.

1022
00:41:58,751 --> 00:42:01,430
He's probably one of the worst examples 
you could ever possibly use.

1023
00:42:01,431 --> 00:42:04,730
He just doesn't know the best example 
that I've used for religion.

1024
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:05,570
Well,
yeah,

1025
00:42:05,571 --> 00:42:10,571
I mean this guy,
he just doesn't know that this guy's 

1026
00:42:10,571 --> 00:42:11,390
bananas because a lot of people don't 
know this guy's bananas,

1027
00:42:11,391 --> 00:42:12,770
you know,
but you know,

1028
00:42:12,771 --> 00:42:14,240
so I'm like,
come on man,

1029
00:42:14,570 --> 00:42:17,010
I don't have time to break all this shit
down for you.

1030
00:42:17,270 --> 00:42:18,440
You know,
if it's helping you,

1031
00:42:18,441 --> 00:42:23,441
that's all well and good,
but just running up to people and 

1032
00:42:23,441 --> 00:42:26,861
thinking you're going to save him in the
parking lot because you couldn't get 

1033
00:42:26,861 --> 00:42:26,861
your shit together and you don't have to
save me.

1034
00:42:26,861 --> 00:42:27,470
All right,
I'm pretty fucking happy.

1035
00:42:27,471 --> 00:42:31,690
And if you really truly believe that the
only way I'm going to get to go have him

1036
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:35,050
go to heaven as Kirk Cameron style where
you have to fuck in,

1037
00:42:35,090 --> 00:42:37,730
you have to accept the Lord.
You ever seen Kirk Cameron go up to like

1038
00:42:37,731 --> 00:42:42,731
gang bangers?
You gotta look Google that Shit on 

1039
00:42:42,731 --> 00:42:45,041
Youtube.
Watch Kirk Cameron's videos where he 

1040
00:42:45,041 --> 00:42:46,991
goes up to people and uses his fucking 
13 year old logic uses like fucking 

1041
00:42:47,301 --> 00:42:50,140
seventh grade logic on people.
When you google it,

1042
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:52,100
typing,
Kirk Cameron owned,

1043
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:55,910
there's a lot of those because that's 
even better.

1044
00:42:56,350 --> 00:43:00,170
Then he starts talking to people who 
actually read fucked.

1045
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:03,170
He's so.
He's so bananas.

1046
00:43:03,171 --> 00:43:05,510
I think Kirk Cameron is almost 
definitely gay.

1047
00:43:05,810 --> 00:43:08,300
The more I watched them in these videos,
the more I'm like this.

1048
00:43:08,301 --> 00:43:13,301
Nothing masculine about this man.
He's very submissive and is desired for 

1049
00:43:13,581 --> 00:43:16,130
chastity and this desire for,
you know,

1050
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,030
for him.
I met him.

1051
00:43:17,031 --> 00:43:19,340
I think I would go over the edge and 
just tried to kiss him.

1052
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:19,700
No,
no.

1053
00:43:19,701 --> 00:43:20,080
Yeah,
yeah.

1054
00:43:20,081 --> 00:43:22,610
I pull out my dick starting to look at 
it,

1055
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:24,730
you know,
just like go hit the.

1056
00:43:24,970 --> 00:43:27,150
I would go to jail for,
you know,

1057
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:29,420
I'm like fuck them.

1058
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:34,060
Just hold them down.
Fucking pulled them down,

1059
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:35,750
jerk off on his chest or something like 
that.

1060
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:38,350
See what he does.
I was this time,

1061
00:43:38,390 --> 00:43:41,670
no stop.
I,

1062
00:43:42,730 --> 00:43:45,790
I used to like him back in the day with 
this show and it growing.

1063
00:43:46,350 --> 00:43:48,170
But I also thought that tracy golden was
hot.

1064
00:43:48,171 --> 00:43:49,340
So I guess I'm just stupid.
Well,

1065
00:43:49,341 --> 00:43:51,380
his wife was Super Hot,
right?

1066
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:54,230
Or she is still stills.
Wow.

1067
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:55,310
Oh No.
He's real life.

1068
00:43:55,790 --> 00:44:00,790
Real life is super hot.
There's something the matter with that 

1069
00:44:00,790 --> 00:44:01,170
dude is chasing down the Lord,
you know,

1070
00:44:01,210 --> 00:44:04,870
I can understand you wanting to study 
what Christianity was.

1071
00:44:04,910 --> 00:44:07,910
What to me in my opinion is,
is an ancient philosophy.

1072
00:44:08,210 --> 00:44:10,130
You know,
it might be incredibly flawed,

1073
00:44:10,131 --> 00:44:15,131
but there's some very good things to it.
There's some very good ideas that love 

1074
00:44:15,131 --> 00:44:15,980
one another as you would love yourself,
you know,

1075
00:44:16,010 --> 00:44:16,500
be,
you know,

1076
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:19,340
treat each other as brothers and sisters
and all that stuff is very good,

1077
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:23,240
but it's got a lot of wacky nonsense in 
it that makes no fucking sense.

1078
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:25,490
And if you really want to study it,
if that's your thing,

1079
00:44:25,790 --> 00:44:26,570
look,
it's just,

1080
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:29,510
there's nothing wrong with people 
studying like Greek mythology,

1081
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:34,540
you know,
like getting into like Zeus and Mithra 

1082
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:34,540
and all that crap.
That's kind of cool.

1083
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:38,360
It's interesting,
but when you really get into like 

1084
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:38,520
Christianity and start thinking that 
this is the real stuff,

1085
00:44:38,521 --> 00:44:41,510
like this is the what the fuck are you 
talking about?

1086
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:44,700
And then you're got to grab other people
and you need to listen to me.

1087
00:44:44,701 --> 00:44:47,160
You need to listen to me.
It's all parents though,

1088
00:44:47,161 --> 00:44:52,161
you know?
I would never have thought that if my 

1089
00:44:52,161 --> 00:44:52,161
parents were when I was a kid though.
Some people know though,

1090
00:44:52,910 --> 00:44:57,910
again,
some people are born again so that it's 

1091
00:44:57,910 --> 00:44:57,910
not their kid or it's not their parents.
Yeah.

1092
00:44:57,910 --> 00:45:02,271
But those are really hard to be born.
I never learned it growing up and then 

1093
00:45:02,271 --> 00:45:02,280
going straight into it.

1094
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:05,640
I think it is of your life falls apart.
I think if your life falls apart and all

1095
00:45:05,641 --> 00:45:10,641
these people that are into Jesus seem 
happy and they seem like they have a 

1096
00:45:10,641 --> 00:45:11,070
path because that's really what it's all
about,

1097
00:45:11,071 --> 00:45:11,790
man.
You know,

1098
00:45:11,791 --> 00:45:13,860
you have to have a path and today 
people,

1099
00:45:14,070 --> 00:45:19,070
if you,
if you think about the way we used to 

1100
00:45:19,070 --> 00:45:21,471
live,
the way our bodies are programmed to 

1101
00:45:21,471 --> 00:45:23,421
live,
I mean we're supposed to be living in 

1102
00:45:23,421 --> 00:45:24,110
fucking huts and caves and shared.
I mean the,

1103
00:45:24,111 --> 00:45:27,450
the hardware that we have right now is 
basically the same hardware,

1104
00:45:27,451 --> 00:45:32,451
the same adrenal system,
the same neuro synapses that connect the

1105
00:45:32,641 --> 00:45:35,460
same way as people that lived 100,000
years ago.

1106
00:45:35,461 --> 00:45:40,461
If you took a person from 100,000
years ago and sat them in the corner 

1107
00:45:40,461 --> 00:45:40,920
right there,
he would be unrecognizable.

1108
00:45:40,921 --> 00:45:42,300
I mean it would be totally normal.

1109
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:43,830
You wouldn't say like,
what the fuck?

1110
00:45:43,831 --> 00:45:46,710
That's a caveman now.
He would look just like us,

1111
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:49,740
but yet 100,000
years ago they had very different needs.

1112
00:45:49,741 --> 00:45:50,880
Man.
There was a.

1113
00:45:51,260 --> 00:45:53,310
You couldn't.
You had shit.

1114
00:45:53,311 --> 00:45:55,260
You had to do.
You had tasks.

1115
00:45:55,261 --> 00:45:56,790
Okay.
You had to go out.

1116
00:45:56,850 --> 00:45:59,430
You gotta find that fucking food every 
day you had a hunt.

1117
00:45:59,431 --> 00:46:04,431
That shit down.
That's what it's like a visceral thrill 

1118
00:46:04,431 --> 00:46:04,560
involved in hunting.
Like hunters will tell you,

1119
00:46:04,561 --> 00:46:06,390
if you ever watch like Ted Nugent,
talk about it.

1120
00:46:06,620 --> 00:46:09,030
A key makes it very appealing and Brock 
Lesnar,

1121
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:11,700
he's got videos with him hunting like 
it's a rush he gives.

1122
00:46:11,701 --> 00:46:15,180
These guys are rushed to kill the animal
and get their meat and it's not like a a

1123
00:46:15,181 --> 00:46:20,181
cruelty rush and they're there.
They want to kill and fucking hurt and 

1124
00:46:20,181 --> 00:46:20,181
destroy.
No,

1125
00:46:20,181 --> 00:46:24,611
it's.
It's a man is supposed to be out there 

1126
00:46:24,611 --> 00:46:24,611
shooting animals and killing them.

1127
00:46:24,611 --> 00:46:25,830
You ever plant food and then eat that 
food?

1128
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:28,230
There's something very exciting about 
that.

1129
00:46:28,231 --> 00:46:33,231
Very,
very rewarding and fulfilling and to a 

1130
00:46:33,231 --> 00:46:35,580
lot of people.
Their life is filled with nothingness.

1131
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:38,760
There's no task everyday.
It's a show up at work.

1132
00:46:38,970 --> 00:46:41,340
Do what you're told.
Do your paperwork,

1133
00:46:41,341 --> 00:46:44,340
stare at the clock,
beg for 5:00,

1134
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:46,800
get the fuck Outta here.
Listen to your wife,

1135
00:46:46,801 --> 00:46:48,240
bitch.
Have a beer.

1136
00:46:48,270 --> 00:46:50,970
Watch law.
Say what the fuck is going on?

1137
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,770
Fall Asleep.
Do it all over again.

1138
00:46:52,771 --> 00:46:55,170
There's no tax,
there's no real,

1139
00:46:55,260 --> 00:47:00,260
there's no real.
So there has to be some meaning to it 

1140
00:47:00,260 --> 00:47:00,260
all.
So someone comes up to you and says,

1141
00:47:00,260 --> 00:47:01,080
Hey man,
I know you feel that way.

1142
00:47:01,081 --> 00:47:03,150
I used to feel that too until I met the 
Lord.

1143
00:47:03,151 --> 00:47:05,550
That emptiness in your life is that you 
don't have the Lord.

1144
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:09,420
When really that emptiness in your life 
is just you're fucking hardware and it's

1145
00:47:09,430 --> 00:47:11,160
just your hardware.
You know?

1146
00:47:11,170 --> 00:47:16,170
Do you think about the way we're wired?
We are not wired to deal with this world

1147
00:47:16,471 --> 00:47:21,471
that we live in right now.
We are wired to deal with thousands of 

1148
00:47:21,471 --> 00:47:21,480
years ago,
18,

1149
00:47:21,481 --> 00:47:23,790
30 something was when they figured out 
the camera.

1150
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:27,900
That means everything before,
less than 200 years ago.

1151
00:47:27,901 --> 00:47:29,200
If you want to know what someone looked 
like,

1152
00:47:29,230 --> 00:47:30,190
someone had a draw

1153
00:47:30,190 --> 00:47:33,940
that person for you.
Do you think it how crazy that is?

1154
00:47:34,090 --> 00:47:37,510
They had a draw your how many fucking 
people can draw.

1155
00:47:38,430 --> 00:47:39,280
I mean,
how many?

1156
00:47:39,490 --> 00:47:41,920
How many people do we really know from 
before?

1157
00:47:41,921 --> 00:47:43,570
1,800.
What they really looked like.

1158
00:47:43,571 --> 00:47:48,100
It's fucking guesswork.
Unless you were Napoleon Napoleon.

1159
00:47:48,101 --> 00:47:49,850
We have hundreds of drawings.
That guy,

1160
00:47:49,870 --> 00:47:51,760
we got a pretty good idea what he looked
like.

1161
00:47:51,761 --> 00:47:54,280
Abraham Lincoln.
Pretty good idea what he looked like.

1162
00:47:54,540 --> 00:47:55,900
You know,
but you don't go way,

1163
00:47:55,901 --> 00:48:00,901
way,
way back 500 years ago with the fuck 

1164
00:48:00,901 --> 00:48:03,180
black people didn't exist back then.
You know,

1165
00:48:04,030 --> 00:48:06,580
white people have only existed for a 
short amount of time.

1166
00:48:06,581 --> 00:48:11,581
You know,
there was a recent study where they 

1167
00:48:11,581 --> 00:48:11,581
figured out how long white people 
around,

1168
00:48:11,581 --> 00:48:12,340
I believe it was like $10,000

1169
00:48:12,350 --> 00:48:14,320
years or something silly.
Let me see.

1170
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:16,240
I'm going to google that because that's 
an important thing.

1171
00:48:16,241 --> 00:48:17,320
How long have Caucasians

1172
00:48:17,910 --> 00:48:22,910
see?
I think black people came before white 

1173
00:48:22,910 --> 00:48:24,681
people and I'm sure I'm sure a lot of 
people don't believe that you think 

1174
00:48:24,681 --> 00:48:28,710
black people came from art kind of way,
like using pallets and colors.

1175
00:48:28,711 --> 00:48:31,020
It has to go that way,
you know,

1176
00:48:31,180 --> 00:48:32,430
so yeah,
you make,

1177
00:48:32,610 --> 00:48:34,140
you have,
you can't go that way.

1178
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:36,450
You know,
black turns into white but white,

1179
00:48:36,451 --> 00:48:40,740
it's not going to turn in black in color
wise if you're mixing colors.

1180
00:48:43,470 --> 00:48:46,200
When did people evolve to be white?
What we do I work for,

1181
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:51,800
uh,
when did people change become white?

1182
00:48:54,030 --> 00:48:55,800
Let's see,
why do people come up?

1183
00:48:56,820 --> 00:48:58,380
Why did people become what?
Alright,

1184
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:03,440
that's why vitamin D probably you're 
saying between 100,000,

1185
00:49:05,980 --> 00:49:07,060
50,000
years ago,

1186
00:49:09,820 --> 00:49:14,820
lower levels of vitamin vitamin D at 
higher latitudes where the sun is less 

1187
00:49:14,820 --> 00:49:18,031
intense,
caused the lightening effect where 

1188
00:49:18,031 --> 00:49:18,031
modern humans became who were,
uh,

1189
00:49:18,031 --> 00:49:19,960
who began darker skin first migrated 
north.

1190
00:49:19,961 --> 00:49:23,680
So human beings have been black until 
about 50,000

1191
00:49:23,681 --> 00:49:26,710
years ago when we started moving around.
And then the climate changed.

1192
00:49:26,711 --> 00:49:29,070
That's pretty fucking chain,
can you pretty crazy shit.

1193
00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:35,380
So there's banana had tried to convert 
me into Jesus,

1194
00:49:35,650 --> 00:49:36,580
at least.

1195
00:49:37,170 --> 00:49:39,570
At least with Jesus,
you're allowed to fucking draw a picture

1196
00:49:39,571 --> 00:49:42,930
of him.
How nutty is the fucking South Park?

1197
00:49:43,060 --> 00:49:44,860
Dang.
Did you watch the episode?

1198
00:49:45,090 --> 00:49:46,740
Yeah,
both of them.

1199
00:49:46,741 --> 00:49:47,940
No,
I couldn't watch it.

1200
00:49:47,941 --> 00:49:52,941
It was driving me crazy.
I was so mad at comedy central for 

1201
00:49:52,941 --> 00:49:53,370
beeping out every.
No.

1202
00:49:53,910 --> 00:49:58,910
Go see the first one,
they didn't do anything on the first 

1203
00:49:58,910 --> 00:49:58,910
one.
The second one because the first one.

1204
00:49:58,910 --> 00:50:03,180
It's so annoying though when you see 
every time they say Mohammed it beeps.

1205
00:50:03,270 --> 00:50:08,270
And then how about when he's in a 
fucking the bear suit and it comes out 

1206
00:50:08,270 --> 00:50:11,880
with Santa Claus and the bear suit,
like did the first episode he was in a u

1207
00:50:11,881 --> 00:50:16,881
haul and it's was like,
like legally that's what they thought 

1208
00:50:17,011 --> 00:50:18,340
that they wouldn't get in trouble.
Right.

1209
00:50:18,350 --> 00:50:21,420
So they just drove,
they drove Mohammed around in a u haul.

1210
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:23,100
He just sit there like,
is this okay?

1211
00:50:23,101 --> 00:50:23,820
Mohamad bub?

1212
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:28,850
No.

1213
00:50:29,570 --> 00:50:31,700
Pendula said something on his twitter 
today,

1214
00:50:31,701 --> 00:50:36,701
and I'm paraphrasing,
but basically said the measure of a 

1215
00:50:36,701 --> 00:50:37,310
religion is a how much you,
you're afraid.

1216
00:50:37,770 --> 00:50:39,860
You know,
what way you can say about a religion is

1217
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:43,160
how much you are afraid to talk about 
them or when you're afraid to talk about

1218
00:50:43,161 --> 00:50:45,110
them,
like how crazy they are.

1219
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:50,200
Basically what he's saying.
And Penn is a very staunch atheist and 

1220
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:51,350
I've been friends with that guy for a 
long time and he doesn't,

1221
00:50:51,370 --> 00:50:54,890
he won't even consider the possibility 
that there's some sort of an intelligent

1222
00:50:54,891 --> 00:50:57,620
life to it all.
He's very scientific,

1223
00:50:57,621 --> 00:50:58,520
but,
you know,

1224
00:50:58,521 --> 00:51:00,890
unfortunately he's never done any 
psychedelic drugs.

1225
00:51:00,980 --> 00:51:02,330
And if,
if he had,

1226
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:04,340
he's never done anything.
He's never had a drop of alcohol.

1227
00:51:04,341 --> 00:51:09,341
He's never even had a single drug except
for when he's had to have surgery when 

1228
00:51:09,341 --> 00:51:09,341
they had a drug.
Um,

1229
00:51:09,341 --> 00:51:12,290
he like takes it very seriously to be 
sober all the time.

1230
00:51:12,620 --> 00:51:13,970
We saw well and good,
but I think,

1231
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:19,000
you know,
you can't really understand what's 

1232
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:19,040
happening in the psychedelic experience 
unless you've had one,

1233
00:51:19,430 --> 00:51:23,150
you know,
point is this fucking Mohamad thing,

1234
00:51:23,390 --> 00:51:23,840
man.

1235
00:51:23,870 --> 00:51:25,140
It's that.
I like how they compared it.

1236
00:51:25,141 --> 00:51:30,141
I don't know if they did in the second 
episode and the first thing they 

1237
00:51:30,141 --> 00:51:31,620
compared it to a the Tom cruise suing 
anyone that says he's gay.

1238
00:51:31,910 --> 00:51:34,130
It's kind of like the Muhammad thing.
You know what?

1239
00:51:34,131 --> 00:51:36,750
You're not allowed to talk about him 
being gay.

1240
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:38,310
Listen,
I'm going to tell you right now.

1241
00:51:38,311 --> 00:51:38,380
Yeah.

1242
00:51:38,410 --> 00:51:41,200
You talked about being gay,
being gay all day long at Cox.

1243
00:51:42,490 --> 00:51:47,490
If you go online,
there's pictures of me with dicks all 

1244
00:51:47,490 --> 00:51:47,490
over the place.
That's the golden rule.

1245
00:51:47,490 --> 00:51:47,490
The Internet.
Right,

1246
00:51:47,490 --> 00:51:49,870
so that a picture of you on the Internet
somewhere.

1247
00:51:50,020 --> 00:51:50,980
Someone is photoshop

1248
00:51:51,220 --> 00:51:52,780
when you're making love South Park 
though.

1249
00:51:52,781 --> 00:51:55,240
I was watching this show.
I was watching orgasmic last night.

1250
00:51:55,241 --> 00:51:56,260
I don't know if you've ever seen that 
one.

1251
00:51:56,261 --> 00:52:01,261
It's a movie at Trey Parker wrote and 
directed and stuff and where he's a 

1252
00:52:01,261 --> 00:52:03,790
mormon and he gets into porn,
but that alone is a great movie.

1253
00:52:03,791 --> 00:52:08,791
How they're always battling religion and
trey is at least something that it's 

1254
00:52:08,791 --> 00:52:08,810
just a fucking love.

1255
00:52:09,170 --> 00:52:10,530
They're the best.
They're the best.

1256
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:12,840
They're the most prolific there.
Shows the best.

1257
00:52:12,841 --> 00:52:16,290
It's the mall to speak to Mike Sense of 
humor the most.

1258
00:52:16,291 --> 00:52:19,440
It's silly,
but it's spot on and brilliant.

1259
00:52:19,620 --> 00:52:22,800
Just the fucking Barbara streisand 
dinosaur monster,

1260
00:52:22,830 --> 00:52:25,260
you know,
machine thing that they had.

1261
00:52:26,220 --> 00:52:28,500
Do you ever see a day?
I don't know.

1262
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:33,560
I think I've told you this before.
There used to be a website called shock 

1263
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:33,560
wave.com.
Used to be shocked,

1264
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:38,001
raved.com,
which was a bunch of flash movies and 

1265
00:52:38,001 --> 00:52:38,790
stuff and they originally paid trey 
Parker and Matt Stone.

1266
00:52:38,850 --> 00:52:41,520
Some crazy amount of money,
but I saw it.

1267
00:52:41,521 --> 00:52:46,521
What was.
It was a show called princess and what 

1268
00:52:46,521 --> 00:52:49,671
it was is they were paid tons and tons 
of money to do and they were like 

1269
00:52:49,671 --> 00:52:50,580
uncensored.
They were like,

1270
00:52:50,581 --> 00:52:52,980
you could do whatever you want,
uncensored.

1271
00:52:52,981 --> 00:52:57,030
This is going to be big on the Internet 
and we're going to give you like $30,000

1272
00:52:57,031 --> 00:53:02,031
an episode or something like that.
And so they hired tray and math to do 

1273
00:53:02,031 --> 00:53:02,790
the series.
If I have 24 episodes,

1274
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,490
they got to the second one turned it in.
We're like,

1275
00:53:05,530 --> 00:53:06,480
wow,
this is great.

1276
00:53:06,510 --> 00:53:07,110
And they're like,
Whoa,

1277
00:53:07,140 --> 00:53:07,680
whoa.

1278
00:53:07,710 --> 00:53:09,530
We sit on sensor.
But this is,

1279
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:14,600
this is out of control too far.
If you go online and have it on my 

1280
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:15,150
website,
[inaudible] dot com.

1281
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:16,230
Uh,
just google,

1282
00:53:16,231 --> 00:53:17,460
uh,
princess,

1283
00:53:17,580 --> 00:53:20,610
uh,
Trey Parker or princess red band,

1284
00:53:20,630 --> 00:53:21,920
you will find it.
And what it is,

1285
00:53:21,921 --> 00:53:24,870
is it just,
it's all about this fluffy little dog.

1286
00:53:24,871 --> 00:53:28,860
It like a Shitzu and it just sits there 
and it starts off.

1287
00:53:28,861 --> 00:53:33,480
It's like all about this dog and then 
it's just like crazy stuff's going on in

1288
00:53:33,481 --> 00:53:35,410
the background that just cute dogs 
watching,

1289
00:53:35,411 --> 00:53:37,860
like watching two people.
Fuck,

1290
00:53:37,861 --> 00:53:39,840
it's watching somebody get murdered.
It's like,

1291
00:53:39,870 --> 00:53:44,870
it's like it's a about this cute little 
cute little dog watching all this 

1292
00:53:44,870 --> 00:53:48,591
horrific shit.
And it only got the two episodes and 

1293
00:53:48,591 --> 00:53:51,830
based,
even though they said they were led to 

1294
00:53:51,830 --> 00:53:51,830
the meeting they wanted,
they're like,

1295
00:53:51,830 --> 00:53:51,830
this too fucked up.
We quit.

1296
00:53:51,830 --> 00:53:52,530
No,
you guys keep the money.

1297
00:53:52,570 --> 00:53:54,090
You can't.
You can't do this anymore.

1298
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:58,350
It's the best,
best videos I've ever seen in my life.

1299
00:53:58,351 --> 00:54:03,351
And I wish Trey Parker and Matt Stone 
would finish that because it was one of 

1300
00:54:03,351 --> 00:54:03,351
the funniest things.
Right?

1301
00:54:03,351 --> 00:54:04,550
Ever seen.
Those guys are so crazy.

1302
00:54:04,551 --> 00:54:07,940
They're the craziest,
they just take things the deepest,

1303
00:54:08,090 --> 00:54:13,090
you know,
like I remember when we saw team 

1304
00:54:13,090 --> 00:54:13,090
America,
I remember being in a theater,

1305
00:54:13,090 --> 00:54:13,760
gone,
I can't believe where they're going with

1306
00:54:13,761 --> 00:54:14,780
this.
I can't,

1307
00:54:14,990 --> 00:54:15,470
you know,
when,

1308
00:54:15,471 --> 00:54:20,471
when,
when the dude starts throwing up and 

1309
00:54:20,471 --> 00:54:20,471
keeps throwing up,

1310
00:54:20,471 --> 00:54:20,940
that's where it's like,
you know,

1311
00:54:21,470 --> 00:54:24,620
Oh fucking football field full of puke 
and he's laying in the center of it.

1312
00:54:24,740 --> 00:54:29,000
I mean they took it to the utmost.
They took it to its total shock humor,

1313
00:54:29,001 --> 00:54:31,400
but brilliant shock humor,
you know,

1314
00:54:31,450 --> 00:54:32,930
like it's not as funny the second time 
around,

1315
00:54:32,931 --> 00:54:37,931
like the throw up seen the thrust and 
the first time around when you don't 

1316
00:54:37,931 --> 00:54:37,931
know it's coming.
It's just God damn.

1317
00:54:37,931 --> 00:54:40,660
It's funny.
It's like one of the best there.

1318
00:54:40,850 --> 00:54:45,850
If they have a movie coming out,
I'm always more excited than anything 

1319
00:54:45,850 --> 00:54:48,851
else except them in Bora Bora or dam and
Ology like close.

1320
00:54:50,060 --> 00:54:50,690
So

1321
00:54:50,910 --> 00:54:53,010
I don't know if it's ever going to work 
on me anymore.

1322
00:54:54,070 --> 00:54:59,070
I wonder what he's doing now.
I wonder if there's like a third movie 

1323
00:54:59,070 --> 00:54:59,070
because I know that

1324
00:54:59,070 --> 00:54:59,720
off.
Maybe if it takes time off,

1325
00:54:59,810 --> 00:55:02,420
if he goes to places where people aren't
aware of it,

1326
00:55:02,450 --> 00:55:07,450
like if he goes to like the south,
like that's what we try to do before I 

1327
00:55:07,450 --> 00:55:07,450
try to go to the south.

1328
00:55:07,450 --> 00:55:08,700
Well it's almost like the,
like Mike Myers,

1329
00:55:08,701 --> 00:55:10,470
it's falling.
It fell in the same category.

1330
00:55:10,471 --> 00:55:11,340
I watched,
you know,

1331
00:55:11,341 --> 00:55:14,430
like the last gold finger movie or 
whatever he did.

1332
00:55:14,790 --> 00:55:16,890
He's just playing the same character 
over and over again.

1333
00:55:17,010 --> 00:55:19,810
And the other day I watched one of my 
old favorite movies was.

1334
00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:22,740
So I married an ax murderer and I used 
to love that movie.

1335
00:55:22,741 --> 00:55:25,590
I've watched you the other day.
I wanted to fucking puke and beat people

1336
00:55:25,591 --> 00:55:29,910
up because it was so awful.
Like Mike Myers to me as died almost.

1337
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:30,340
They do

1338
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:35,440
his last movie looked like,
like you know those movies where they 

1339
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:37,790
have a guy who used to be funny and then
all the sudden,

1340
00:55:37,791 --> 00:55:41,240
like in the movie he takes a terrible 
turn and now he's not funny anymore.

1341
00:55:41,241 --> 00:55:46,241
It's putting out crap.
And the were shaking their heads and 

1342
00:55:46,241 --> 00:55:48,630
ease and the downward spiral of life.
That last movie where he played the 

1343
00:55:48,630 --> 00:55:48,630
Indian guy the love.
Yeah.

1344
00:55:48,630 --> 00:55:50,490
Grew gold member.
Whatever the fuck.

1345
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:52,000
I love girl.
Yeah.

1346
00:55:52,370 --> 00:55:54,230
Watch the ads for that.
You're like,

1347
00:55:54,231 --> 00:55:56,480
okay,
what is funny about this?

1348
00:55:56,481 --> 00:56:01,481
This is like antifungal.
It's like this is like a guy who forgot 

1349
00:56:01,481 --> 00:56:01,950
what funny is.
It's just like,

1350
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:06,760
but what's crazy is if you go back as 
far as swipe merit and ax murder,

1351
00:56:06,761 --> 00:56:10,030
which was way before Austin powers or 
any of that stuff,

1352
00:56:10,270 --> 00:56:15,270
it destroyed that movie because that was
the same character as all his other 

1353
00:56:15,270 --> 00:56:16,240
movies.
It was so awful.

1354
00:56:16,241 --> 00:56:17,680
It's,
it's man.

1355
00:56:17,681 --> 00:56:21,430
Can you imagine like Timpson Wayne's 
world worries coming out.

1356
00:56:22,490 --> 00:56:23,590
Shrek.
Shrek guy.

1357
00:56:24,250 --> 00:56:28,660
Wayne's world was fucking genius.
Him and Dana Carvey were awesome.

1358
00:56:28,661 --> 00:56:33,661
I mean when,
when those movies were on the wrong 

1359
00:56:33,661 --> 00:56:33,661
though.
I mean that.

1360
00:56:33,661 --> 00:56:33,661
Those were great,
great fun,

1361
00:56:33,661 --> 00:56:36,020
fun movies,
but the new stuff he does like,

1362
00:56:36,021 --> 00:56:37,650
I don't even like the Austin powers 
movies.

1363
00:56:37,670 --> 00:56:38,710
I never got it.
I.

1364
00:56:38,980 --> 00:56:43,270
It's not my shit.
Did you hear about the iphone leak?

1365
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:46,750
If you don't know about this iphone,
the iphone four,

1366
00:56:46,751 --> 00:56:51,751
the came out and it's like some crazy 
ass new iphone with a front facing 

1367
00:56:51,751 --> 00:56:56,071
camera and well apparently some dude and
this is the store and a lot of people 

1368
00:56:56,071 --> 00:56:57,220
think that this is all bullshit and hype
and it's just,

1369
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:58,660
you know,
making the uh,

1370
00:56:58,661 --> 00:57:02,800
the iphone story bigger.
I personally don't because I don't think

1371
00:57:02,950 --> 00:57:07,120
apple would ever release a thing on 
purpose,

1372
00:57:07,121 --> 00:57:08,670
you know,
and have people find it.

1373
00:57:08,740 --> 00:57:12,640
Lot of the companies did this though.
Not a lot of companies a virus.

1374
00:57:12,780 --> 00:57:17,780
The viral marketing nowadays that's 
being used on the Internet is so 

1375
00:57:17,780 --> 00:57:21,690
amazingly deep in like you would not 
think of the shift that's happening,

1376
00:57:21,691 --> 00:57:23,730
right?
Chocolate down the reebok commercial.

1377
00:57:23,731 --> 00:57:25,920
Exactly where he's native and all that 
stuff.

1378
00:57:25,950 --> 00:57:26,790
I mean,
it's ridiculous.

1379
00:57:26,791 --> 00:57:30,740
I could almost see this to build hype 
with cell phones because if you look at,

1380
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:35,800
there's a website called boy genius 
report dot Com and you could totally 

1381
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:39,330
tell this guy's in bed or he was in bed 
with blackberry at one point.

1382
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:40,980
Like there was times where it was like,
all right,

1383
00:57:41,100 --> 00:57:46,100
you got this phone like a year ahead of 
anybody else and you already have and 

1384
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:48,060
already a video of using it and stuff 
like that.

1385
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:51,120
That seems a little fishy that your 
friends let you borrow it.

1386
00:57:51,121 --> 00:57:53,370
And when it comes out like a year later,
you know,

1387
00:57:53,490 --> 00:57:53,730
there's.

1388
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:56,190
And I almost think it's just shifting 
the leaked out,

1389
00:57:56,191 --> 00:58:01,191
kind of like on the Internet,
you're going to see what people's 

1390
00:58:01,191 --> 00:58:01,191
reactions are trying to tweak things.
You know,

1391
00:58:01,191 --> 00:58:02,620
it's almost like we're the,
you know,

1392
00:58:03,020 --> 00:58:04,380
some of them are living,
I'm sure.

1393
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:06,510
So don't believe know about this apple 
thing though,

1394
00:58:06,540 --> 00:58:09,510
that it seems to me like the dude got 
fired.

1395
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:10,820
Didn't get fired.
Yeah.

1396
00:58:10,830 --> 00:58:12,330
He got fired.
Police are involved now.

1397
00:58:12,610 --> 00:58:15,810
You hear about the Gizmodo God,
they broke down his house.

1398
00:58:15,860 --> 00:58:20,860
He broke down his fucking front door,
took all his computers because the 

1399
00:58:20,860 --> 00:58:20,860
reporter that that recorded,
well,

1400
00:58:20,860 --> 00:58:22,680
he got a copy of it.
They paid $5,000

1401
00:58:22,690 --> 00:58:25,030
dollars for the,
for the actual phone.

1402
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:30,240
So they paid money for the phone and 
apparently apple saying that that's 

1403
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:33,241
their stolen property and you're not 
supposed to be having that reporting on 

1404
00:58:33,241 --> 00:58:36,001
it.
So they went to the guy's house who 

1405
00:58:36,001 --> 00:58:36,001
wrote this whole report,
broke down his house,

1406
00:58:36,001 --> 00:58:38,440
took all of his fucking computers to two
servers servers in his house.

1407
00:58:38,441 --> 00:58:39,190
That's a super geek.

1408
00:58:39,490 --> 00:58:41,020
Yeah.
Well he is a super geek.

1409
00:58:41,021 --> 00:58:44,930
I mean the main editor of one of the 
biggest tech websites,

1410
00:58:45,190 --> 00:58:50,190
not only is he get free shit,
but I'm more interested in is imagine 

1411
00:58:50,190 --> 00:58:53,681
somebody coming to your house,
taking your computer and took 

1412
00:58:53,681 --> 00:58:57,121
everything.
That's why it freaks me out or to 

1413
00:58:57,121 --> 00:58:57,121
because a computer and nothing to do 
with the self.

1414
00:58:57,121 --> 00:58:58,870
I think nowadays that's one of the most 
scariest things ever.

1415
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:03,960
Ever.
Somebody can now come in and take your 

1416
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:05,650
diary and put it into their database,
your whole diary.

1417
00:59:05,710 --> 00:59:06,850
Never.
Where do you ever think like,

1418
00:59:06,851 --> 00:59:08,770
okay,
the cops just came and took my diary.

1419
00:59:08,780 --> 00:59:11,170
Now they know everything about me.
Every feeling,

1420
00:59:11,171 --> 00:59:13,660
every thing I'm thinking now.
That's what our computers,

1421
00:59:13,661 --> 00:59:15,010
our diaries now.
Yeah.

1422
00:59:15,011 --> 00:59:17,710
You get all your emails from like a 
fucking million years.

1423
00:59:17,740 --> 00:59:21,860
So this Guy Bob and iphone and now his 
diary is owned by the every photo you've

1424
00:59:21,861 --> 00:59:22,040
ever

1425
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:24,050
taken,
all as computers.

1426
00:59:24,190 --> 00:59:26,810
Like why do they think that they can 
just take your computers?

1427
00:59:26,811 --> 00:59:28,440
Is it to get a um,
a,

1428
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:33,520
like a,
a track tracking of the emails to see 

1429
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:33,520
like,
you know,

1430
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:36,200
I think it's an open door that if they 
can,

1431
00:59:36,650 --> 00:59:37,070
they can

1432
00:59:37,190 --> 00:59:39,140
pretty much just like searching your 
car.

1433
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:41,150
The cops want to search a car 
regardless.

1434
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:43,760
Even if they're just trying to pull you 
over for a seatbelt,

1435
00:59:43,820 --> 00:59:45,380
they want to search a car and see what 
else I can find.

1436
00:59:45,410 --> 00:59:46,160
But I mean the,
the,

1437
00:59:46,161 --> 00:59:51,161
the,
a lot of people are saying that this 

1438
00:59:51,161 --> 00:59:51,161
warrant was unlawful and that they 
shouldn't have.

1439
00:59:51,161 --> 00:59:52,430
It's totally online.
La.

1440
00:59:52,460 --> 00:59:53,790
Are you sure?
Are you a lawyer?

1441
00:59:53,850 --> 00:59:58,850
It's a cell phone.
Somebody bought A cell phone from 

1442
00:59:58,850 --> 00:59:58,850
another step.

1443
00:59:58,850 --> 00:59:58,940
Right.
But they bought a stolen cell phone,

1444
00:59:58,941 --> 01:00:01,100
a cell phone that's basically stolen 
property.

1445
01:00:01,101 --> 01:00:06,101
I mean the guy lost his cell phone,
but it's the property of apple and it's 

1446
01:00:06,101 --> 01:00:07,460
very sensitive property because it's a 
prototype.

1447
01:00:07,490 --> 01:00:07,770
Yeah,
yeah,

1448
01:00:07,890 --> 01:00:08,760
yeah,
yeah.

1449
01:00:08,790 --> 01:00:12,070
I guess you're right.
But I think basically they fucked up in,

1450
01:00:12,071 --> 01:00:14,480
in stealing the phone or in buying the 
phone.

1451
01:00:14,690 --> 01:00:17,030
What they should have done is given the 
fucking phone back to apple.

1452
01:00:17,031 --> 01:00:22,031
I mean the company doesn't want you 
reviewing their shit before it's out 

1453
01:00:22,031 --> 01:00:22,031
yet.
I mean,

1454
01:00:22,031 --> 01:00:23,390
I don't think that's a,
a huge request.

1455
01:00:23,690 --> 01:00:25,280
If you know that it's there,
they're shit.

1456
01:00:25,310 --> 01:00:26,240
You're doing something illegal.

1457
01:00:26,370 --> 01:00:28,500
I think they more fucked up.
Gizmodo,

1458
01:00:28,650 --> 01:00:33,650
more fucked up.
Just letting everyone know who the guy 

1459
01:00:33,650 --> 01:00:36,660
who lost his putting his face on the 
websites and everything.

1460
01:00:37,320 --> 01:00:39,160
That's fucked up man.
You know that's

1461
01:00:39,430 --> 01:00:42,940
do though was going to get busted.
Anyone that was fucking phone anymore.

1462
01:00:43,290 --> 01:00:44,780
Yeah.
Really what they should've done it.

1463
01:00:44,781 --> 01:00:46,630
They knew all this shit is given back as
god damn phone

1464
01:00:46,670 --> 01:00:48,000
I think.
Or the way they should have done is it's

1465
01:00:48,020 --> 01:00:48,620
like,
oh shit.

1466
01:00:48,621 --> 01:00:50,570
It's just a cell phone.
I would chill the fuck out.

1467
01:00:51,930 --> 01:00:56,930
It's got a front facing camera now.
You know how domino's is all going to 

1468
01:00:56,930 --> 01:00:57,500
sound october.
We're like,

1469
01:00:57,830 --> 01:00:58,940
everyone's got it now.

1470
01:01:00,510 --> 01:01:04,410
Crush att and t service.
If you think atd service sucks,

1471
01:01:04,411 --> 01:01:09,411
a big bag index.
Now wait till that front facing camera 

1472
01:01:09,411 --> 01:01:12,141
comes out and everyone everywhere is 
going to be fucking use streaming while 

1473
01:01:12,141 --> 01:01:12,420
they're driving the car.
Talking,

1474
01:01:12,510 --> 01:01:15,420
sitting in the fucking black guy piece.
I got a feeling

1475
01:01:18,170 --> 01:01:23,170
it's good.
It's going to be a million fucking 

1476
01:01:23,170 --> 01:01:25,000
people doing that all over the.
Of turning it on like I've always said 

1477
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:28,240
that that's going to be the end of the 
world is when everyone has their own 

1478
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:31,151
channel and everyone basically is like a
walking television channel and instead 

1479
01:01:31,151 --> 01:01:31,151
of like,
hey,

1480
01:01:31,151 --> 01:01:33,500
what's your fucking facebook page?
CAn I facebook you?

1481
01:01:33,650 --> 01:01:38,650
What's your twitter?
It's going to be what channel is your 

1482
01:01:38,650 --> 01:01:38,990
life?
You're going to have a fucking helmet on

1483
01:01:39,110 --> 01:01:44,110
and it's going to be a front facing 
camera that shows you as you're walking 

1484
01:01:44,110 --> 01:01:47,801
through the world and you know you're 
going to have a video camera 

1485
01:01:47,801 --> 01:01:47,801
broadcasting everything.
Yeah.

1486
01:01:47,801 --> 01:01:50,920
That's kind of like what you stream does
and whitening like justin tv does.

1487
01:01:51,100 --> 01:01:53,550
Justin tv originally was called 
lifecasting,

1488
01:01:53,590 --> 01:01:58,120
which was 24 hours a day falling around.
Justin who?

1489
01:01:58,121 --> 01:02:00,850
I had a camera filming his whole entire 
life.

1490
01:02:00,850 --> 01:02:05,850
Do you remember when we were in san 
francisco and justin tv was going to 

1491
01:02:05,850 --> 01:02:06,810
give us a laptop and a backpack.
I was really weird connection.

1492
01:02:06,811 --> 01:02:09,190
That was really weird.
So strange with the dude who came to the

1493
01:02:09,191 --> 01:02:10,230
show with it.

1494
01:02:10,840 --> 01:02:15,840
No,
we're going to hook you all up and then 

1495
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:15,840
we'd go to lunch and he goes,
this is the laptop,

1496
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:16,900
this is the camera.
All right.

1497
01:02:17,020 --> 01:02:19,410
And then like put it back in is like,
what were we supposed to there?

1498
01:02:19,411 --> 01:02:21,540
Was there a.
Was going to get it all to us

1499
01:02:22,140 --> 01:02:24,320
and we started making fun of it.
Oh that'S right.

1500
01:02:24,321 --> 01:02:25,260
We weren't.
We were like,

1501
01:02:25,261 --> 01:02:26,970
what if it cuts out?
This is silly,

1502
01:02:26,980 --> 01:02:29,910
this current backpack around like what 
am I going to do?

1503
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:32,120
And we decided that it would be 
ridiculous and they were like,

1504
01:02:32,140 --> 01:02:36,810
didn't want to be like broadcast shows.
I have enough problems with people.

1505
01:02:36,870 --> 01:02:39,900
You tubing my shit before it's done at 
shows.

1506
01:02:39,901 --> 01:02:42,280
Like when you come up with new bits,
you know,

1507
01:02:42,281 --> 01:02:46,230
like sometimes when a bit like is out 
and it's not a cd,

1508
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:49,650
you know,
that's to me when it's an old bit.

1509
01:02:49,890 --> 01:02:54,890
But if I got bits that aren't on,
they haven't been on television have 

1510
01:02:54,890 --> 01:02:54,890
been seeded annual urge you to have 
good,

1511
01:02:54,890 --> 01:02:55,740
you know,
like you've seen it.

1512
01:02:55,741 --> 01:02:59,130
How have you seen it?
So I also saw youtube clips some asshole

1513
01:02:59,131 --> 01:03:04,131
and the audience is videotaping it now 
people are saying that like it's old 

1514
01:03:04,131 --> 01:03:04,131
material.

1515
01:03:04,131 --> 01:03:04,200
I'm like god damn,
it isn't even done yet.

1516
01:03:04,350 --> 01:03:06,430
It's not done.
You know like you can't.

1517
01:03:06,750 --> 01:03:09,020
So like when they were like,
well we want to use stream,

1518
01:03:09,070 --> 01:03:09,810
you know,
your,

1519
01:03:09,811 --> 01:03:14,811
your whole show mike,
you can't use tree my show because when 

1520
01:03:14,811 --> 01:03:16,530
the material comes out I want at least 
the majority of people you know,

1521
01:03:16,531 --> 01:03:19,260
to watching the television show other 
than the people that have seen me in the

1522
01:03:19,261 --> 01:03:20,820
clubs,
I wanted to be new shit.

1523
01:03:20,821 --> 01:03:25,821
I want it to the dvd to be all shit 
that's not on another dvd and it's not 

1524
01:03:25,821 --> 01:03:28,590
going to work that way if there's 
fucking these ustream clips.

1525
01:03:28,591 --> 01:03:32,970
And justin tv shows eveRywhere and so I 
thought the whole thing was too much,

1526
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:38,000
you know,
and it's not that entertaining to like 

1527
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:38,000
to,
to broadcast every fucking thing you do.

1528
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:41,100
I mean with this show,
like I think we sit down,

1529
01:03:41,130 --> 01:03:43,830
we do it for two hours,
we're Banging out and that's it.

1530
01:03:44,100 --> 01:03:49,100
You don't want to just keep having 
content where you're watered down what 

1531
01:03:49,100 --> 01:03:49,100
people,

1532
01:03:49,100 --> 01:03:51,880
but you have no personal life.
They used to be a website called gab,

1533
01:03:51,881 --> 01:03:54,580
gab.com.
I used to be addicted to,

1534
01:03:54,760 --> 01:03:59,020
which was about maybe eight years ago,
was this girl named gabriel gabriel.

1535
01:03:59,021 --> 01:04:04,021
And she's an author in New York city and
she livecast herself via webcam where 

1536
01:04:04,601 --> 01:04:09,601
would like refresh every 10 seconds 
because it was when the internet was 

1537
01:04:09,601 --> 01:04:09,601
new.
Oh,

1538
01:04:09,601 --> 01:04:09,940
you know,
now he's like,

1539
01:04:09,970 --> 01:04:11,800
that was actually kind of cool back in 
the day.

1540
01:04:11,801 --> 01:04:14,290
So would have three cameras that would 
just refresh every 10 seconds.

1541
01:04:14,530 --> 01:04:17,170
But I got addicted to watching it 
because it was so weird.

1542
01:04:17,290 --> 01:04:20,240
She would come home,
talk to the husband,

1543
01:04:20,350 --> 01:04:25,350
would make dinner,
then they would bring the camera into 

1544
01:04:25,350 --> 01:04:25,550
the bedroom and have sex.
That's the part I liked the most,

1545
01:04:25,551 --> 01:04:26,620
so I'll watch them.
Bang,

1546
01:04:27,460 --> 01:04:28,930
bang.
Completely naked.

1547
01:04:28,931 --> 01:04:30,860
Was this when people couldn't record 
things on?

1548
01:04:31,220 --> 01:04:33,220
Yeah,
this is way before that,

1549
01:04:33,250 --> 01:04:37,270
but it was so addicting and the one day 
she just left and it felt like she broke

1550
01:04:37,271 --> 01:04:39,910
up with us,
beaten off just right.

1551
01:04:40,450 --> 01:04:45,040
Like if you turned it on there in the 
middle of stroke,

1552
01:04:45,070 --> 01:04:46,480
15 seconds later,
stroke,

1553
01:04:47,580 --> 01:04:48,220
they stopped.

1554
01:04:48,380 --> 01:04:50,160
Someone stopped answering the phone or 
something like that.

1555
01:04:51,410 --> 01:04:53,280
Yeah,
I mean there was a show.

1556
01:04:53,281 --> 01:04:55,410
Do you remember that movie with William 
Baldwin?

1557
01:04:55,650 --> 01:04:57,660
I think it was like william,
maybe Sharon Stone or something.

1558
01:04:57,710 --> 01:04:59,460
A splinter.
I think it was called.

1559
01:04:59,700 --> 01:05:01,290
It was about those people that have 
their.

1560
01:05:01,310 --> 01:05:04,030
I think that's moving out.
Was there.

1561
01:05:04,140 --> 01:05:09,140
Wasn't there a movie where a these 
peoples all their whole lives before 

1562
01:05:09,170 --> 01:05:10,840
mtv,
like somewhat.

1563
01:05:11,620 --> 01:05:13,080
Maybe I've got the premise totally 
wrong,

1564
01:05:13,350 --> 01:05:15,720
but like something like mtv is a perfect
example.

1565
01:05:15,721 --> 01:05:20,721
Member ed tv mean that basically 
predicted the rise of the kim 

1566
01:05:20,721 --> 01:05:25,441
kardashians type shows.
I mean basically that's what that show 

1567
01:05:25,441 --> 01:05:27,190
was like and people in the movie was 
like so ridiculous.

1568
01:05:27,191 --> 01:05:30,460
The idea that people would just 
broadcast their entire lives,

1569
01:05:30,580 --> 01:05:34,570
like how ridiculous I look at this.
And in the end the message was that it's

1570
01:05:34,571 --> 01:05:35,690
too much.
you know,

1571
01:05:35,710 --> 01:05:37,830
the message was that it fucked up this 
guy's life.

1572
01:05:38,230 --> 01:05:40,000
He had to stop doIng it to get his shit 
together.

1573
01:05:40,060 --> 01:05:41,170
Totally.
meanwhile,

1574
01:05:41,390 --> 01:05:43,000
there,
there's more of those goddamn shows than

1575
01:05:43,001 --> 01:05:44,590
ever.
They're real now.

1576
01:05:45,550 --> 01:05:48,040
It's funny how many things from the 
past,

1577
01:05:48,041 --> 01:05:49,630
whatever sliver.
That's it.

1578
01:05:49,660 --> 01:05:54,660
Yeah.
It's funny how many things in the past 

1579
01:05:54,660 --> 01:05:55,420
were um,
the that people predicted or like a real

1580
01:05:55,421 --> 01:05:58,060
part of life now that were like 
ridiculous back then.

1581
01:05:58,210 --> 01:06:01,750
like this idea of mtv doesn't,
that's a real part of our life now.

1582
01:06:02,860 --> 01:06:03,530
You know,
I mean,

1583
01:06:03,550 --> 01:06:05,980
it makes you wonder about like mad max 
and shit like that.

1584
01:06:05,981 --> 01:06:10,981
And that's when,
when peak oil comes and people are 

1585
01:06:10,981 --> 01:06:10,981
fucking,
you know,

1586
01:06:10,981 --> 01:06:12,400
driving a bio diesel cars down this 
tree.

1587
01:06:12,690 --> 01:06:17,200
They made fucking corn fuel out of and 
fucking shooting at people trying to get

1588
01:06:17,201 --> 01:06:18,670
fresh water.
You know,

1589
01:06:18,700 --> 01:06:20,680
I wonder if that really could go down 
like that.

1590
01:06:21,070 --> 01:06:24,070
I think so.
I totally believe that.

1591
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:26,850
Read that and talk about your tooth.
Oh,

1592
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:31,880
they want to consign missed brian miss 
last week's podcast because he was.

1593
01:06:32,410 --> 01:06:37,410
Have you ever.
Have you ever chipped a tooth or a 

1594
01:06:37,410 --> 01:06:40,290
filling?
Fallen out of your mouth and you could 

1595
01:06:40,290 --> 01:06:40,290
feel the air go inside your tooth and 
hit your fillings?

1596
01:06:40,290 --> 01:06:43,960
Fall out.
Will you bid a spoon?

1597
01:06:43,980 --> 01:06:45,190
Right?
Well,

1598
01:06:45,250 --> 01:06:48,430
yeah,
I'm used to eating with plastic spoons,

1599
01:06:48,520 --> 01:06:53,520
but uh,
I ran out of plastic spoons so I went 

1600
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:55,300
back to real spoons and I forgot and I 
always chew on the plastic spoon.

1601
01:06:55,301 --> 01:06:57,770
Why do you chew on a plastic spoon?
Like when I'm on,

1602
01:06:57,830 --> 01:06:59,560
like on the internet or whatever.
I'm just like,

1603
01:06:59,590 --> 01:07:00,190
she wanted,
you know,

1604
01:07:00,191 --> 01:07:01,700
like I'll,
I'll eat yogurt and has,

1605
01:07:01,710 --> 01:07:06,710
it'd be that kind of like chewy,
but I forgot it wasn't a plastic spirit 

1606
01:07:06,731 --> 01:07:07,900
inside.
It's like crunch and like,

1607
01:07:09,160 --> 01:07:11,530
that's not smart dude.
Be chewing on.

1608
01:07:11,690 --> 01:07:16,690
It still hurts.
I have to go back in a month to get a 

1609
01:07:16,690 --> 01:07:16,690
real thing.

1610
01:07:16,690 --> 01:07:16,690
That's,
that's ridiculous,

1611
01:07:16,690 --> 01:07:18,600
son.
That's not good.

1612
01:07:19,040 --> 01:07:21,000
Um,
what else I want to talk about?

1613
01:07:21,030 --> 01:07:26,030
Oh,
some dudes are certainly from noah's 

1614
01:07:26,030 --> 01:07:26,030
ark.

1615
01:07:26,030 --> 01:07:27,740
Is this the same people that found it?
show show one people?

1616
01:07:28,070 --> 01:07:28,940
Yeah,
there's a.

1617
01:07:28,970 --> 01:07:31,130
is that.
Was that joe show show number one?

1618
01:07:31,260 --> 01:07:33,840
Yeah,
there was one that we did from atlanta.

1619
01:07:33,870 --> 01:07:36,480
You could find it on the internet if you
could find a red band.com,

1620
01:07:36,481 --> 01:07:36,720
right?

1621
01:07:36,790 --> 01:07:41,790
Yeah.
Or it's show show google joe show a all 

1622
01:07:41,790 --> 01:07:41,790
one word

1623
01:07:41,790 --> 01:07:42,080
arc.
Yeah.

1624
01:07:42,140 --> 01:07:43,430
Joe rogan.
Noah's ark.

1625
01:07:43,431 --> 01:07:44,960
But anyway,
there was a dude back.

1626
01:07:44,961 --> 01:07:49,961
Dan said that he had found no ark and 
now apparently there's a group of 

1627
01:07:50,121 --> 01:07:52,270
evangelists that claim they've seen 
noah's ark.

1628
01:07:52,280 --> 01:07:53,870
Have you seen the photos of it?
Now?

1629
01:07:54,290 --> 01:07:55,620
It's kind of interesting.
Let's see it.

1630
01:07:55,640 --> 01:07:57,520
I'll show it to you.
Stupid.

1631
01:07:59,010 --> 01:08:00,670
So you're going to send me photos of a 
boat.

1632
01:08:02,110 --> 01:08:07,110
I'm supposed to.
I believe it's a big foot lift on this 

1633
01:08:07,110 --> 01:08:07,110
boat.

1634
01:08:07,110 --> 01:08:07,110
Well,
you never know.

1635
01:08:07,860 --> 01:08:12,860
Stranger things have happened.
The crazy thing about these ideas of 

1636
01:08:12,860 --> 01:08:14,700
world floods is that there was no world 
communication back then.

1637
01:08:14,701 --> 01:08:15,980
So how do you know the flood wasn't

1638
01:08:15,980 --> 01:08:17,700
just in your neighborhood,
you know,

1639
01:08:17,750 --> 01:08:22,750
and you think that it was a,
you know,

1640
01:08:23,270 --> 01:08:28,270
you think that it was somewhere else.
I think that it was everywhere around 

1641
01:08:28,270 --> 01:08:28,270
the world,
like you really don't have any idea.

1642
01:08:28,270 --> 01:08:30,490
Damn.
Look at you and you're following 100.

1643
01:08:30,491 --> 01:08:32,350
Almost 110.
One.

1644
01:08:32,351 --> 01:08:32,800
Oh,
nine,

1645
01:08:32,801 --> 01:08:33,270
five,
nine,

1646
01:08:33,300 --> 01:08:35,950
seven son.
Very nice.

1647
01:08:36,350 --> 01:08:37,930
Uh,
uh,

1648
01:08:38,650 --> 01:08:39,280
you know,
it's funny.

1649
01:08:39,281 --> 01:08:44,281
It's my space.
I logged in the other day and I've been 

1650
01:08:44,281 --> 01:08:47,020
losing friends like thousands and 
thousands at a time.

1651
01:08:47,710 --> 01:08:50,710
It's ridiculous.
Everyone's deleted or myspace account.

1652
01:08:50,711 --> 01:08:52,480
I'm reallY thinking about maybe doing 
it.

1653
01:08:52,481 --> 01:08:57,481
I'm thinking of deleting mine too.
I just don't want to remember those 

1654
01:08:57,481 --> 01:08:57,481
days.
Anyway.

1655
01:08:57,481 --> 01:08:58,610
That is my space days.
Yeah,

1656
01:08:58,630 --> 01:08:59,710
it's pretty silly,
right?

1657
01:08:59,711 --> 01:09:04,711
Yeah.
It's like having a kid that you just 

1658
01:09:04,711 --> 01:09:05,710
need to cut off strings or something.
I can't find the article.

1659
01:09:05,760 --> 01:09:06,400
Oh wow.
I,

1660
01:09:06,490 --> 01:09:08,380
I,
I'll look at a picture of a boat.

1661
01:09:08,950 --> 01:09:11,870
It's not even a boat.
It's like some would that have found.

1662
01:09:11,970 --> 01:09:16,970
The funny thing is,
is one picture that's really clear with 

1663
01:09:16,970 --> 01:09:19,740
this guy inside out.
It just says this is know as arc.

1664
01:09:19,750 --> 01:09:24,160
It's pretty interesting because this guy
is standing inside something

1665
01:09:24,330 --> 01:09:24,720
[inaudible].

1666
01:09:34,060 --> 01:09:34,520
Yeah.
See,

1667
01:09:36,720 --> 01:09:37,960
look at this.
What is that?

1668
01:09:38,530 --> 01:09:40,750
This guy claims that that sees inside 
noah's ark.

1669
01:09:40,990 --> 01:09:44,620
Isn't that a photo from noah's ark 
ministries international?

1670
01:09:44,650 --> 01:09:46,400
I'll,
I'll throw this link up.

1671
01:09:46,660 --> 01:09:48,730
Uh,
if you just google it looks like my face

1672
01:09:48,760 --> 01:09:53,760
was arc.
If you just google they found noah's 

1673
01:09:53,760 --> 01:09:53,760
ark.
You could see it.

1674
01:09:53,760 --> 01:09:54,250
This is the noah's ark thing we're 
talking about.

1675
01:09:54,940 --> 01:09:58,430
Ate that shit.
It's so.

1676
01:09:58,460 --> 01:10:03,460
It's so annoying because I have certain 
people in my real life that believe all 

1677
01:10:04,941 --> 01:10:08,720
this shit and so they put it on facebook
and I have to,

1678
01:10:08,721 --> 01:10:10,400
like,
it hurts me to read.

1679
01:10:10,401 --> 01:10:13,160
It's just start trolling them.
I got trolled.

1680
01:10:13,170 --> 01:10:17,340
But the girl that pretended that she 
wanted to convert her friend to,

1681
01:10:17,341 --> 01:10:18,460
uh,
from uh,

1682
01:10:18,570 --> 01:10:20,790
being um,
the girls hindu,

1683
01:10:20,820 --> 01:10:25,820
you know,
that video that I put online of her and 

1684
01:10:25,820 --> 01:10:25,830
adobe friends are trying to convert the 
hindu girl and to being christian.

1685
01:10:25,860 --> 01:10:28,260
Well apparently it's a giant troll.
This girl scott like,

1686
01:10:28,280 --> 01:10:29,370
oh,
it's Brilliant.

1687
01:10:29,460 --> 01:10:34,460
It's really good.
Like she totally seemed like it wasn't 

1688
01:10:34,460 --> 01:10:34,460
over the top at all.
I mean it was like,

1689
01:10:34,680 --> 01:10:38,040
it was very much like jesus camp or any 
of that stuff that,

1690
01:10:38,041 --> 01:10:38,880
you know,
that's real,

1691
01:10:38,940 --> 01:10:41,000
you know.
So tell us your kenny,

1692
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:42,450
how much you mean to tell about your 
store,

1693
01:10:42,940 --> 01:10:47,940
the story about your sItuation with the 
religious people that are go wacky on 

1694
01:10:47,940 --> 01:10:49,170
you about a certain thing in your life.

1695
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:52,310
I'm talking about.
They're talking about that,

1696
01:10:52,750 --> 01:10:57,750
but you've got a lot.
You got a lot of religious people in 

1697
01:10:57,750 --> 01:10:57,750
your life.
Yeah,

1698
01:10:57,750 --> 01:11:01,321
I got a lot and I'm doing like the exact
opposite of what they would enjoy to 

1699
01:11:02,210 --> 01:11:04,080
were combining.
Yeah,

1700
01:11:04,120 --> 01:11:05,500
exactly.
Did you,

1701
01:11:05,501 --> 01:11:07,240
um,
did you watch the fights this weekend?

1702
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:08,110
No,
I did not.

1703
01:11:08,170 --> 01:11:09,940
I didn't even know where to put lots of 
the face.

1704
01:11:10,270 --> 01:11:14,100
Where was paper review and it was a very
ufc

1705
01:11:14,130 --> 01:11:16,830
did it feel like the us exactly what to 
ufc.

1706
01:11:17,220 --> 01:11:19,660
But it was like that.
I dunno,

1707
01:11:19,930 --> 01:11:20,760
I dunno,
I,

1708
01:11:20,761 --> 01:11:24,480
I would love to keep doing atlanta doing
commentary for the lighter weights.

1709
01:11:24,481 --> 01:11:27,820
I think those guys need more.
They deserve more credit.

1710
01:11:27,930 --> 01:11:32,930
They're more action packed or fucking 
those fights are crazy and right now 

1711
01:11:32,930 --> 01:11:34,740
they're like in this like shadow 
organization of the ufc.

1712
01:11:34,741 --> 01:11:39,741
It's a small organization,
doesn't get nearly as much attention as 

1713
01:11:39,741 --> 01:11:40,830
the ufc and uh,
I wish we absorbed them,

1714
01:11:40,890 --> 01:11:42,110
you know,
I wish we had a.

1715
01:11:42,150 --> 01:11:47,150
If it was up to me,
I mean obviously it's not as a lot of 

1716
01:11:47,150 --> 01:11:47,150
business contracts and all sorts of 
jazz,

1717
01:11:47,150 --> 01:11:51,561
but it would be the coolest thing in the
world to be able to call those lighter 

1718
01:11:51,561 --> 01:11:51,561
weight fights.
Man.

1719
01:11:51,561 --> 01:11:54,810
Uriah favorite fought jose aldo in the 
main event for the featherweight title.

1720
01:11:55,120 --> 01:11:56,010
You're my favorite.

1721
01:11:56,010 --> 01:11:59,340
Got he got beat up,
got kicked the shit out of his legs.

1722
01:11:59,341 --> 01:12:00,660
It's incredible fight.
If you watch it,

1723
01:12:00,661 --> 01:12:03,210
it was more incredible live watching it 
because,

1724
01:12:03,211 --> 01:12:05,220
uh,
this dude just picked your favorite part

1725
01:12:05,221 --> 01:12:06,390
man.
He just arrived.

1726
01:12:06,391 --> 01:12:07,410
Favor.
I mean,

1727
01:12:07,411 --> 01:12:09,420
some people gave him around.
I think.

1728
01:12:09,450 --> 01:12:12,660
I don't know what they were thinking 
because basically in my opinion,

1729
01:12:12,720 --> 01:12:17,720
although that's dominated every single 
round and at a certain point in time 

1730
01:12:17,720 --> 01:12:21,201
just to had them mounted in a crucifix,
just punched him in the face for like a 

1731
01:12:21,201 --> 01:12:21,660
minute and a half.
It Was ridiculous.

1732
01:12:21,661 --> 01:12:26,490
I mean he just completely dominated 
favor and favor is a fucking beast,

1733
01:12:26,491 --> 01:12:31,491
man.
A beast just couldn't stop the leg 

1734
01:12:31,491 --> 01:12:31,491
kicks.
Leg checks kept coming,

1735
01:12:31,491 --> 01:12:31,491
you know,
all those.

1736
01:12:31,491 --> 01:12:36,361
So god damn fast.
Although used to be a real serious 

1737
01:12:36,361 --> 01:12:39,201
soccer player too.
He played semi professional soccer and 

1738
01:12:39,201 --> 01:12:39,201
those soccer players,
man,

1739
01:12:39,201 --> 01:12:40,770
they have incredible legs I think can 
move really good.

1740
01:12:40,920 --> 01:12:45,920
Their works really good and they kick 
really hard and he's just so good at 

1741
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:45,920
moving in and out.
You know,

1742
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:50,601
soccer is all about moving side to side.
Quick moves to deal with the ball and 

1743
01:12:50,940 --> 01:12:52,680
those guys that are real good at soccer 
man,

1744
01:12:52,681 --> 01:12:54,780
that really translates well to be able 
to kick,

1745
01:12:54,781 --> 01:12:56,150
you know,
throwing leg kicks and,

1746
01:12:56,420 --> 01:12:56,900
and,
and,

1747
01:12:56,901 --> 01:13:01,901
and getting out of the way of leg kicks 
and just the ability to spring forward 

1748
01:13:01,901 --> 01:13:03,210
and spring back.
Soccer's a fucking,

1749
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:05,950
a tremendous,
a place to start,

1750
01:13:05,970 --> 01:13:08,220
tremendous base for certain types of 
fighting,

1751
01:13:08,221 --> 01:13:10,650
especially for like more time.
You know,

1752
01:13:10,950 --> 01:13:13,170
you guys say tito ortiz and channel.
We already talked about that.

1753
01:13:13,171 --> 01:13:14,790
But you're going to have to go to the 
uh,

1754
01:13:14,900 --> 01:13:19,900
recording shit son.
You can't be talking about it over and 

1755
01:13:19,900 --> 01:13:20,940
over.
How loud were those leg kicks?

1756
01:13:21,030 --> 01:13:26,030
The thing about leg kicks is the 
goldbergs was talking about that it's 

1757
01:13:26,030 --> 01:13:26,030
not slap.

1758
01:13:26,030 --> 01:13:27,490
It's a thump.
The ones that are really hard don't,

1759
01:13:27,540 --> 01:13:32,540
they're not as loud because of like say 
if you hit someone's thigh with your 

1760
01:13:32,540 --> 01:13:33,570
open hand like that and slap the skin of
his thought,

1761
01:13:33,571 --> 01:13:38,571
it'd be really loud.
But If you hit their thigh with a 

1762
01:13:38,571 --> 01:13:40,911
baseball bat,
it would be like a midi thump in the 

1763
01:13:40,911 --> 01:13:42,600
midi.
Thumps are a lot more painful.

1764
01:13:43,190 --> 01:13:48,190
What it is,
the shin just digging into the meat of 

1765
01:13:48,190 --> 01:13:49,410
the leg and it fucking hurts.
Like hell.

1766
01:13:49,490 --> 01:13:54,490
It's you.
You really can't appreciate how bad a 

1767
01:13:54,490 --> 01:13:54,930
leg kick hurts.
Unless someone likes you,

1768
01:13:54,931 --> 01:13:56,250
someone good,
you know,

1769
01:13:56,251 --> 01:13:59,730
you get like some fucking melvin men 
who've type character.

1770
01:13:59,780 --> 01:14:03,060
Some are nesto who's type due to slam a 
leg kicking your leg.

1771
01:14:03,061 --> 01:14:04,740
You realize like,
god damn,

1772
01:14:04,741 --> 01:14:08,100
it's so fucking painful and that's what 
this guy's move was.

1773
01:14:08,101 --> 01:14:11,470
He just kicked his legs out from under 
him until he was useless from the second

1774
01:14:11,471 --> 01:14:13,180
round out.
He was pretty much useless.

1775
01:14:13,530 --> 01:14:14,620
It was.
It was sad.

1776
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:17,520
No,
but mohammed south park thing.

1777
01:14:17,610 --> 01:14:19,260
I really liked how the.
The,

1778
01:14:19,620 --> 01:14:22,830
the extremeness website kept on getting 
hacked.

1779
01:14:22,980 --> 01:14:24,250
Did you see that?
Oh,

1780
01:14:24,310 --> 01:14:26,880
the islamic islamic.
Yeah.

1781
01:14:26,910 --> 01:14:28,230
Yeah.
What was their name?

1782
01:14:28,260 --> 01:14:30,270
Radical islam.
They were from New York,

1783
01:14:30,271 --> 01:14:30,720
right?
Yeah.

1784
01:14:31,620 --> 01:14:33,570
Fucking traitors.
Ridiculous.

1785
01:14:34,260 --> 01:14:38,220
The idea that you don't mean that's 
taken nutty to a whole new level.

1786
01:14:38,240 --> 01:14:41,520
Yeah.
You can't even show our guy in a picture

1787
01:14:41,521 --> 01:14:43,220
or will fuck.
not even a drawing,

1788
01:14:43,290 --> 01:14:45,570
a stick figure that even look like a 
stick figure,

1789
01:14:45,571 --> 01:14:46,000
but.
Oh,

1790
01:14:46,050 --> 01:14:47,790
you didn't see it?
I didn't see the first episode.

1791
01:14:47,791 --> 01:14:50,220
They drama mohamad and it pulled up or a
second.

1792
01:14:50,280 --> 01:14:55,280
It was just like a stick figure,
but it was like a circle align and like 

1793
01:14:55,280 --> 01:14:56,550
some kind of wiggly coming out and it 
went like this.

1794
01:14:56,551 --> 01:14:59,010
They just showed up like that and that's
muhammad.

1795
01:14:59,050 --> 01:15:01,410
It's incredible.
It's incredible.

1796
01:15:01,411 --> 01:15:01,980
But here we are,

1797
01:15:02,110 --> 01:15:07,110
2010 and there's people out there that 
really believe that you shouldn't have a

1798
01:15:07,361 --> 01:15:09,880
drawing that represents their,
their,

1799
01:15:09,940 --> 01:15:11,530
their guy,
their messiah,

1800
01:15:11,531 --> 01:15:13,510
their profit.
And the funny thIng is,

1801
01:15:13,511 --> 01:15:18,511
is fucking guy.
I said that once and this guy emailed 

1802
01:15:18,511 --> 01:15:18,511
me,
hey,

1803
01:15:18,511 --> 01:15:19,100
dumb ass.
The reason why you're not allowed to,

1804
01:15:19,101 --> 01:15:24,101
It's because they don't want.
You're worshiping false idols and 

1805
01:15:24,101 --> 01:15:24,101
imagery.
Like,

1806
01:15:24,101 --> 01:15:24,101
okay,
I'm a dumb ass.

1807
01:15:24,101 --> 01:15:28,740
So you think it's okay to kill people 
because someone's drawing some fucking 

1808
01:15:28,740 --> 01:15:30,610
guy that may or may not have even 
existed.

1809
01:15:30,630 --> 01:15:31,540
Uh,
you know,

1810
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:36,600
you can't.
When you go back a couple of thousand 

1811
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:39,330
years was mohammed like 1500 years ago.
When you go back like a thousand years 

1812
01:15:39,330 --> 01:15:40,330
plus,
man,

1813
01:15:40,331 --> 01:15:45,331
who the fuck knows what really happened 
is I want to draw mohammed real quick 

1814
01:15:45,331 --> 01:15:47,280
while you're talking to it.
Managers die.

1815
01:15:47,350 --> 01:15:48,480
No,
I want to draw it again.

1816
01:15:48,980 --> 01:15:53,980
Have no,
you don't have anythIng to do about 

1817
01:15:53,980 --> 01:15:53,980
this.
I have no,

1818
01:15:53,980 --> 01:15:53,980
no,
no.

1819
01:15:53,980 --> 01:15:56,420
Say I could not stop him.
It's just your mom and.

1820
01:15:56,500 --> 01:15:58,890
Yes.
This is brian's version of mama.

1821
01:15:58,910 --> 01:16:01,830
Does this dispersion.
Muhammad is not sanctioned by ustream?

1822
01:16:02,050 --> 01:16:07,050
No,
I think it is sanctioned as they invest 

1823
01:16:07,050 --> 01:16:07,220
this.
No,

1824
01:16:07,300 --> 01:16:07,750
no.
Got it.

1825
01:16:08,140 --> 01:16:09,430
Okay.
This is muhammad.

1826
01:16:10,620 --> 01:16:12,040
That's incredible.
Yes.

1827
01:16:12,100 --> 01:16:13,450
That's very lifelike.
Yes,

1828
01:16:14,370 --> 01:16:16,870
but here's muhammad with a mustache just
in case I forgot.

1829
01:16:17,200 --> 01:16:22,200
I guess drawing was probably way more 
important a couple of hundred years ago 

1830
01:16:22,200 --> 01:16:26,090
for photos.
How do you think everybody knew how to 

1831
01:16:26,090 --> 01:16:26,090
draw?
I think people knew how to draw better.

1832
01:16:26,090 --> 01:16:27,610
But you think like if someone like 
someone raped you,

1833
01:16:27,611 --> 01:16:29,550
you had the right?
Yeah,

1834
01:16:29,640 --> 01:16:31,930
because like how bad is people's memory?
You know,

1835
01:16:32,040 --> 01:16:37,040
how many people had been arrested for 
shit because of eye witness reports and 

1836
01:16:37,040 --> 01:16:41,491
you know,
people make this eyewitness report and 

1837
01:16:41,491 --> 01:16:43,531
then they arrest someone sand that.
Sam and it turns out they were totally 

1838
01:16:43,531 --> 01:16:44,020
wrong and then they apologize.
I'm so sorry.

1839
01:16:44,021 --> 01:16:46,090
And the person does like fucking 15 
years in jail.

1840
01:16:46,450 --> 01:16:47,110
You know,
back then.

1841
01:16:47,111 --> 01:16:49,210
What the fuck did they do?
What do they do back then?

1842
01:16:49,630 --> 01:16:50,890
You know,
they,

1843
01:16:51,720 --> 01:16:53,910
they found the stones that look like the
rape.

1844
01:16:54,450 --> 01:16:59,450
This stone,
this trade for assembled,

1845
01:17:00,011 --> 01:17:03,050
if theY just had a box of stones,
which one looks most like your race?

1846
01:17:03,830 --> 01:17:08,830
You know,
I love people that are like really into 

1847
01:17:08,830 --> 01:17:10,921
ufos and shit and like say they talk 
about images that are around like cave 

1848
01:17:10,921 --> 01:17:10,921
walls.

1849
01:17:10,921 --> 01:17:11,990
I've given seen the images on cave 
walls.

1850
01:17:11,991 --> 01:17:14,500
They're like flying saucers and aliens 
on the cave walls.

1851
01:17:14,520 --> 01:17:17,300
Like no.
Or know those fucking.

1852
01:17:17,330 --> 01:17:22,330
How do you know?
Those guys didn't just eat a mess on 

1853
01:17:22,330 --> 01:17:22,330
mushroom trip.

Well what if it's like a children's book
for their small kid come from this guy 

1856
01:17:29,341 --> 01:17:34,341

We don't know what the fuck they're 

1857
01:17:36,641 --> 01:17:39,000
drawing.
You just found some scribbles on a wall.

1858
01:17:39,150 --> 01:17:41,100
If you found some of my drawings,
you'd be like,

1859
01:17:41,101 --> 01:17:42,660
what?
That guy looked like a.

1860
01:17:43,030 --> 01:17:44,800
There was people that look lIke dicks.
Get that.

1861

You see that hand and that are not that 
one little that bolo that.

1862
01:17:48,290 --> 01:17:53,290
The drawing pad.
That's some shit found found from my 

1863
01:17:53,290 --> 01:17:53,290
high school years.
Yeah,

1864
01:17:53,290 --> 01:17:54,880
that's awesome.
This is from when I was 15.

1865
01:17:55,530 --> 01:18:00,530
It's crazy.
I'll put some scan all this shit in 

1866
01:18:00,530 --> 01:18:03,640

than I.

1867
01:18:03,641 --> 01:18:06,150
I was and I did it all the time.
This was like,

1868
01:18:07,380 --> 01:18:10,600
this is from when I was a kid.
It is a super cat.

1869
01:18:10,601 --> 01:18:11,770
Huh?
Oh shit.

1870
01:18:12,070 --> 01:18:17,070
Like some shit that I drew.
I used to draw a lot is loosely used to,

1871
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:21,010
uh,
that's what I really used to wanna be is

1872
01:18:21,011 --> 01:18:23,660
a,
an artist for a comic book.

1873
01:18:23,670 --> 01:18:26,410
So 1982.
So I guess I was 15,

1874
01:18:26,440 --> 01:18:27,520
19,
82.

1875
01:18:29,080 --> 01:18:32,740
I was eight years old.
Older than you son.

1876
01:18:33,880 --> 01:18:37,180
I love how all your shit's monsters.
Just scared of monsters,

1877
01:18:37,181 --> 01:18:38,240
man.
Yeah.

1878
01:18:39,130 --> 01:18:44,130
Goldilocks and three bears.
I'm going to have to do something 

1879
01:18:44,340 --> 01:18:48,460
because I don't really draw anymore.
Sweet.

1880
01:18:49,210 --> 01:18:50,650
Don't.
Here's a wolf.

1881
01:18:51,700 --> 01:18:55,050
I was always into werewolves.
That's why I was so bummed out that uh,

1882
01:18:55,051 --> 01:19:00,051
that benicio del toro movie fucking 
sucked because it did fucking act like 

1883
01:19:00,051 --> 01:19:05,041
it didn't happen.
Is that waterfall ninjitsu like this one

1884
01:19:07,660 --> 01:19:09,670
peeinG on the bed.
Pain over the bed,

1885
01:19:09,671 --> 01:19:11,170
ping from the bed.
Ping.

1886
01:19:16,210 --> 01:19:20,390
It's like describing the bed is like 
being on the.

1887
01:19:20,460 --> 01:19:23,430
This might be a project that I had to do
for school.

1888
01:19:23,530 --> 01:19:28,060
I got in trouble all the time because it
was when I was on the wrestling team,

1889
01:19:28,061 --> 01:19:31,780
I drew the wrestling logo for our high 
school wrestling when,

1890
01:19:31,781 --> 01:19:33,460
um,
when I was as well.

1891
01:19:33,461 --> 01:19:35,130
I also drew the logo for our,
um,

1892
01:19:35,650 --> 01:19:38,500
our school.
We had like tee shirts for newton,

1893
01:19:38,501 --> 01:19:40,390
south red lion.
So I drew the line.

1894
01:19:40,480 --> 01:19:42,380
I used to do that too.
I did the worth,

1895
01:19:42,490 --> 01:19:46,380
the worthington kilborne official bungee
jumping and shirt,

1896
01:19:46,381 --> 01:19:49,780
which is a cardinal bungee jumping.
But uh,

1897
01:19:49,820 --> 01:19:54,820
um,
that's another one that's funded from a 

1898
01:19:54,820 --> 01:19:54,930
picture from.
There's an old uh,

1899
01:19:55,060 --> 01:19:57,820
I think it was long.
Chaney junior or no,

1900
01:19:57,880 --> 01:20:00,190
I don't remember which one.
Which werewolf moving.

1901
01:20:00,490 --> 01:20:03,610
Maybe it was oliver marijuana.
I don't know which one it was.

1902
01:20:04,590 --> 01:20:06,310
Oh,
that's bad ass dude.

1903
01:20:06,410 --> 01:20:07,410
Look how good it look.
Color.

1904
01:20:07,411 --> 01:20:11,500
You're going to color the drew.
But uh,

1905
01:20:11,880 --> 01:20:13,470
before here's humpty dumpty.

1906
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:15,840
Humpty dumpty.
The ax murderer.

1907
01:20:16,260 --> 01:20:19,020
I drew a lot of.
Should put the other signature book.

1908
01:20:19,170 --> 01:20:21,390
Yeah.
I'll do something with conan,

1909
01:20:22,830 --> 01:20:24,670
conan the barbarian.
Nancy.

1910
01:20:24,780 --> 01:20:29,780
That's amazing.
Some another werewolf I was fucking 

1911
01:20:29,780 --> 01:20:29,780
obsessed with.
Werewolves,

1912
01:20:29,780 --> 01:20:33,450
for whatever fucking gary's.
And that's how I just,

1913
01:20:33,451 --> 01:20:38,451
uh,
I've always loved the wolf man werewolf 

1914
01:20:38,451 --> 01:20:39,890
though,
wasn't like your father and you know,

1915
01:20:41,080 --> 01:20:44,130
I think I was an angry kid.
I was always obsessed with the idea that

1916
01:20:44,131 --> 01:20:44,870
you could,
uh,

1917
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:47,040
I think it would represented to me was 
like,

1918
01:20:47,430 --> 01:20:51,060
you know,
that you can be calm and normal and then

1919
01:20:51,061 --> 01:20:55,410
some shit happens on just right now.
Maybe that's what I wanted to do.

1920
01:20:55,411 --> 01:20:58,440
I wanted to fucking hulk out on people 
and turn into a werewolf,

1921
01:20:58,690 --> 01:21:01,290
kill motherfuckers.
I don't know when you're an angry kid,

1922
01:21:01,320 --> 01:21:02,670
that's never good.
But I,

1923
01:21:02,671 --> 01:21:04,560
um,
I w I told me wanting,

1924
01:21:04,561 --> 01:21:09,561
wanted to be a comic book artist,
but my high school art teacher was a 

1925
01:21:09,561 --> 01:21:09,850
douche bag.

1926
01:21:10,140 --> 01:21:15,140
He was just so suppressive and annoying 
and unhappy and had no joy.

1927
01:21:15,990 --> 01:21:17,760
There was no happiness.
This man,

1928
01:21:17,910 --> 01:21:21,590
everything was serious.
Like his art was serious and you know,

1929
01:21:21,591 --> 01:21:24,090
and he would draw on.
I didn't think he was talented.

1930
01:21:24,091 --> 01:21:26,550
He was like,
he would draw like boring shit,

1931
01:21:26,551 --> 01:21:29,370
you know,
he would like draw like pears and stuff,

1932
01:21:29,371 --> 01:21:30,870
you know,
like a bowl of fruit bowl,

1933
01:21:31,030 --> 01:21:32,690
always gay faggot,
you know,

1934
01:21:32,780 --> 01:21:34,410
I've got a camera.
If I want to see fruit,

1935
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:36,790
I'll take a picture of it.
Let me see.

1936
01:21:36,830 --> 01:21:41,830
You got a photo of wolverine fighting 
spiderman now shut the fuck up because 

1937
01:21:41,830 --> 01:21:46,221
that's what I like.
And he was telling me that what I liked 

1938
01:21:46,221 --> 01:21:48,771
was like Juvenile and then it was like 
foolish and that like my car and I was 

1939
01:21:48,771 --> 01:21:50,070
like,
you're just suppressing what I like,

1940
01:21:50,240 --> 01:21:53,370
you know,
I like watching fucking monster movies.

1941
01:21:53,370 --> 01:21:56,370
I like reading comic books.
Is there something wrong with that?

1942
01:21:56,371 --> 01:22:01,371
It's just entertainment.
I hate when people pretend that they're 

1943
01:22:01,371 --> 01:22:04,551
entertainment somehow or another is more
valid or more sophisticated just because

1944
01:22:05,401 --> 01:22:07,230
it's like serious,
you know,

1945
01:22:07,790 --> 01:22:09,960
like people who love serious movies like
[inaudible],

1946
01:22:09,980 --> 01:22:10,680
like,
you know,

1947
01:22:11,130 --> 01:22:13,740
don't be so serious when it was like 
whatever man,

1948
01:22:13,800 --> 01:22:15,690
are you learning something when you go 
to see like,

1949
01:22:16,020 --> 01:22:16,530
like,
you know,

1950
01:22:16,620 --> 01:22:21,620
some depressing sean penn movie?
Are you learning something when you go 

1951
01:22:21,620 --> 01:22:22,200
to see those moments?
And nikki in touch with my emotions,

1952
01:22:22,201 --> 01:22:23,910
joe,
it was that river movie,

1953
01:22:23,911 --> 01:22:26,300
whatever the fuck river runs through it.
No,

1954
01:22:26,350 --> 01:22:30,870
the sean penn won boss Mr.
Rivers or whatever.

1955
01:22:31,050 --> 01:22:31,920
But it was like,
you know,

1956
01:22:31,921 --> 01:22:33,820
and everybody's like,
it's such an important film.

1957
01:22:33,821 --> 01:22:33,900
Like

1958
01:22:34,370 --> 01:22:35,090
what?
What?

1959
01:22:35,091 --> 01:22:35,810
What's,
what?

1960
01:22:35,811 --> 01:22:37,460
Film is important.
Okay.

1961
01:22:37,461 --> 01:22:40,850
They're fucking movies man.
You go to a movie and enjoy yourself.

1962
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,160
You have a good time.
It takes you someplace.

1963
01:22:43,270 --> 01:22:45,030
It gives you some thrills.
You know,

1964
01:22:45,070 --> 01:22:50,070
you,
there's a lot of shit you don't know 

1965
01:22:50,070 --> 01:22:50,070
what's happening.
Things get resolved.

1966
01:22:50,070 --> 01:22:50,070
How's this going to.
What's going to go down?

1967
01:22:50,070 --> 01:22:51,650
That's all it is.
It's fucking entertainment.

1968
01:22:51,770 --> 01:22:56,770
And the idea that your entertainment 
because it represents like things that 

1969
01:22:56,770 --> 01:22:59,570
happen in real life as somehow or 
another superior to like superheroes are

1970
01:22:59,571 --> 01:23:01,510
monsters.
Like please just.

1971
01:23:02,100 --> 01:23:03,940
I had a good art teacher like I.
It's funny because I got.

1972
01:23:03,970 --> 01:23:05,890
I'll get seasoned,
he's in class because I would

1973
01:23:06,190 --> 01:23:11,190
sleep except for art,
which I straight a pluses took every 

1974
01:23:11,190 --> 01:23:14,701
class.
but my teacher was cool and like a lot 

1975
01:23:14,701 --> 01:23:14,701
of my paintings I look back and I'm 
like,

1976
01:23:14,701 --> 01:23:14,770
wow,
she let me do this.

1977
01:23:14,890 --> 01:23:19,150
One was called pool table on acid and 
she gave me an a minus and it was just a

1978
01:23:19,220 --> 01:23:22,000
pool table with a monster coming out of 
it and everything was melting.

1979
01:23:23,180 --> 01:23:25,970
Why noT?
I didn't have to draw it.

1980
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:26,620
She didn't make me do it.

1981
01:23:27,450 --> 01:23:30,180
My teacher used to say shit to me.
Like,

1982
01:23:30,181 --> 01:23:30,600
you know,
like,

1983
01:23:30,601 --> 01:23:31,380
well,
you know what?

1984
01:23:31,381 --> 01:23:35,160
If you get a job where you have to draw 
a baby for a diaper commercial,

1985
01:23:35,161 --> 01:23:37,380
I want to see you draw a baby for a 
diaper commercial.

1986
01:23:38,300 --> 01:23:39,790
And I'm like,
oh man,

1987
01:23:40,360 --> 01:23:45,360
why are you fucking draw a baby for a 
diaper

1988
01:23:45,440 --> 01:23:46,110
commercial?
Like,

1989
01:23:46,190 --> 01:23:51,080
is that my future is what I have to look
forward to drawn diaper ads.

1990
01:23:51,110 --> 01:23:56,110
Like he was like real,
like my dream was to do comic book 

1991
01:23:57,021 --> 01:24:02,021
illustrations and he was telling me 
basically you need to have skills 

1992
01:24:02,121 --> 01:24:05,390
because you're not going to reach those 
dreams and what if you have a job that's

1993
01:24:05,391 --> 01:24:10,391
just you as an illustrator doing boring 
stuff where you have to drop boring 

1994
01:24:10,391 --> 01:24:10,391
stuff.
And I was like,

1995
01:24:10,391 --> 01:24:12,380
You fucking buzz kill,
you know,

1996
01:24:12,470 --> 01:24:16,970
and this guy was just a dumpy physically
out of shape.

1997
01:24:17,030 --> 01:24:22,030
Unhealthy person and he was just 
depressed all the time and so I killed 

1998
01:24:22,311 --> 01:24:24,920
my effectively I,
I went,

1999
01:24:24,921 --> 01:24:27,470
I only went for two years to our,
our class,

2000
01:24:27,471 --> 01:24:32,471
I believe it was 14 and 15.
I think by the time I went into my 

2001
01:24:32,471 --> 01:24:33,020
junior year of high school,
I think I said,

2002
01:24:33,021 --> 01:24:34,910
fuck that guy.
I'm tired of this is annoying.

2003
01:24:35,060 --> 01:24:38,210
So I just drew on my own from then on it
that effectively killed my,

2004
01:24:38,240 --> 01:24:40,910
my wanting to uh,
go to school for art.

2005
01:24:40,950 --> 01:24:45,950
I was looking at art colleges and shit 
and had scholarships lined up and trying

2006
01:24:46,041 --> 01:24:51,041
to figure out where to go.
So that's the only thing I had a chance 

2007
01:24:51,041 --> 01:24:52,640
of getting any sort of scholarship.
Then meanwhile it's just teachers,

2008
01:24:53,090 --> 01:24:58,090
you know,
you don't realize what a gigantic 

2009
01:24:58,090 --> 01:24:58,970
fucking effect having a good or a shitty
teacher can have on.

2010
01:24:58,971 --> 01:24:59,110
Yeah.

2011
01:24:59,480 --> 01:25:00,390
but don't,
you know,

2012
01:25:00,420 --> 01:25:02,900
they're cutting their salaries over and 
over again.

2013
01:25:02,901 --> 01:25:07,901
I just saw they're cutting it again and 
I think teachers should be one of the 

2014
01:25:07,901 --> 01:25:08,630
most important things ever,
you know,

2015
01:25:08,660 --> 01:25:10,850
like up there with doctors.
ThAt's junk.

2016
01:25:10,851 --> 01:25:11,660
Canton.
yeah.

2017
01:25:11,770 --> 01:25:16,770
It's amazing how we were so short when 
it comes shortsighted when it comes to 

2018
01:25:16,770 --> 01:25:16,770
that.

2019
01:25:16,770 --> 01:25:17,560
Yeah.
what is that?

2020
01:25:17,770 --> 01:25:19,780
You're raising the child from the 
beginning.

2021
01:25:19,781 --> 01:25:20,490
That should be the most them

2022
01:25:20,510 --> 01:25:22,730
important thing.
It should be huge.

2023
01:25:22,760 --> 01:25:26,240
People that can influence your children 
and people that say mean shit.

2024
01:25:26,241 --> 01:25:31,241
Like I will never forget.
I had a math teacher in high school who 

2025
01:25:31,241 --> 01:25:34,491
was just fucking boring and the class 
was boring and she was this black lady 

2026
01:25:35,301 --> 01:25:36,680
hood,
a black accent.

2027
01:25:36,830 --> 01:25:38,600
Like she would mispronounce words all 
the time.

2028
01:25:38,601 --> 01:25:43,601
She had terrible grammar and yet she 
would like shit all over you if you 

2029
01:25:43,601 --> 01:25:43,670
didn't understand her,
her,

2030
01:25:43,720 --> 01:25:48,720
her math problems and she was in there 
doing her math problem and I was bored 

2031
01:25:49,100 --> 01:25:51,590
and I was like drawing or something.
They usually,

2032
01:25:51,591 --> 01:25:54,890
that's what I do in class and we'll draw
my notebooks and stuff like that and she

2033
01:25:54,891 --> 01:25:59,891
goes,
she looks up and she sees me not paying 

2034
01:25:59,891 --> 01:25:59,891
attention.
So she goes,

2035
01:25:59,891 --> 01:26:04,600
mr rogan,
would you like to come up here and do 

2036
01:26:04,600 --> 01:26:04,820
both of these for the class?
And I said,

2037
01:26:05,880 --> 01:26:07,680
do you want me to do both of those 
problems?

2038
01:26:08,170 --> 01:26:12,510
And everybody started fucking and so she
said,

2039
01:26:12,570 --> 01:26:14,610
go down to the dean's office right now.
I said,

2040
01:26:14,611 --> 01:26:16,650
okaY,
but when I get back I'm going to do both

2041
01:26:16,651 --> 01:26:19,270
of those problems.
Mean eveRybody was laughing.

2042
01:26:19,290 --> 01:26:21,300
She goes,
go ahead and laugh and mr rogen,

2043
01:26:21,420 --> 01:26:24,870
mr welbourne ain't going nowhere.
He's going nowhere in life.

2044
01:26:25,110 --> 01:26:30,110
And I'm like,
at least I know how to say both get out 

2045
01:26:30,110 --> 01:26:30,110
of my classroom.
And she kicked me out of that.

2046
01:26:30,110 --> 01:26:30,110
So

2047
01:26:30,110 --> 01:26:34,870
that was like the beginning of my time 
as a standup comedian because I felt 

2048
01:26:34,870 --> 01:26:35,600
like I was defending myself.
Like I wasn't doing anything to you.

2049
01:26:35,750 --> 01:26:37,490
I'll just sitting there scribbling in my
notebook.

2050
01:26:38,300 --> 01:26:43,300
I just wasn't paying attention because I
was bored out of my fucking head and I 

2051
01:26:43,300 --> 01:26:43,550
had problems with authority but she 
just,

2052
01:26:43,660 --> 01:26:44,900
you know,
liked to be the,

2053
01:26:44,901 --> 01:26:47,600
the lady to call on you if you ain't 
paying attention,

2054
01:26:47,870 --> 01:26:49,400
you know,
like she went to get mad.

2055
01:26:49,401 --> 01:26:51,650
But I mean meanwhile this fucking pitch 
could even speak.

2056
01:26:51,651 --> 01:26:53,900
Right.
She said both.

2057
01:26:54,020 --> 01:26:55,730
Would you like to come up here and do 
both?

2058
01:26:55,940 --> 01:27:00,940
I will never forget it.
IT's like in my mind it's like a movie 

2059
01:27:00,940 --> 01:27:03,641
playing out because the anger in my head
that this fucking dummy was trying to 

2060
01:27:03,641 --> 01:27:08,051
make me look dumb in front of everybody 
just because I was scribbling and I 

2061
01:27:08,051 --> 01:27:08,051
wasn't paying attention to your.

2062
01:27:08,051 --> 01:27:10,490
My.
My opinion on math was always like,

2063
01:27:10,850 --> 01:27:12,560
okay,
math is very essential,

2064
01:27:12,590 --> 01:27:16,040
but don't you have calculators now we do
and isn't that like an endless supply of

2065
01:27:16,041 --> 01:27:17,870
batteries?
There is done.

2066
01:27:18,260 --> 01:27:23,260
Like I'm done [inaudible].
There's only a finite amount of things 

2067
01:27:23,260 --> 01:27:25,841
to pay attention to in the day and I 
don't give a fuck about these wacky 

2068
01:27:25,841 --> 01:27:26,300
equations that you're making me solve 
and figure out.

2069
01:27:26,301 --> 01:27:28,040
I know how to add.
I know how to divide.

2070
01:27:28,041 --> 01:27:30,960
I know how to multiply.
Like is it or are we done here?

2071
01:27:30,961 --> 01:27:32,240
Right.
Do I have to keep going?

2072
01:27:32,420 --> 01:27:35,930
Is this really good that you're,
you're making me be a fucking square peg

2073
01:27:35,931 --> 01:27:38,090
and fit into your fucking round hole.
You know?

2074
01:27:38,091 --> 01:27:43,091
It's like I'm not.
I don't want to do what you want me to 

2075
01:27:43,091 --> 01:27:43,091
do.
Like this is nonsense.

2076
01:27:43,091 --> 01:27:47,290
It's weird nowadays.
I can't even imaGine going to school 

2077
01:27:47,290 --> 01:27:47,290
with google

2078
01:27:47,290 --> 01:27:47,290
because then I'd be like,
no,

2079
01:27:47,290 --> 01:27:49,190
I don't want to learn it.
I can just search it if I need it.

2080
01:27:49,191 --> 01:27:51,980
I don't get what.
That was a problem.

2081
01:27:51,990 --> 01:27:56,990
I used to watch a lot of documentaries 
even when I was a kid and I got in 

2082
01:27:56,990 --> 01:27:56,990
trouble again.
Like people will say like,

2083
01:27:56,990 --> 01:27:57,890
you're a comedian.
Were you a class clown?

2084
01:27:58,100 --> 01:28:03,100
Like I was not really class clown.
What I used to do though is draw a lot 

2085
01:28:03,100 --> 01:28:05,390
of cartoons about our teachers are 
gettIng involved in shit.

2086
01:28:05,391 --> 01:28:09,470
And we had this one teacher that was 
really annoying Mr.

2087
01:28:09,470 --> 01:28:14,180
Holman and h o l m a n very serious,
but he was wrong about a lot of shit.

2088
01:28:14,390 --> 01:28:15,500
And I was,
you know,

2089
01:28:15,501 --> 01:28:18,570
I was fucking 15 years old and uh,
I was uh,

2090
01:28:18,740 --> 01:28:21,260
in class and I was again bored out of my
fucking mind.

2091
01:28:21,261 --> 01:28:26,261
He had a science class,
but at least science custOmers a little 

2092
01:28:26,261 --> 01:28:26,261
more interesting.
They started going on about lake erie,

2093
01:28:26,261 --> 01:28:27,650
lake erie,
jerry's a dead lake and this and that.

2094
01:28:27,651 --> 01:28:30,290
It started talking about all the 
pollution that's involved in lake erie,

2095
01:28:30,530 --> 01:28:35,530
and I said,
well actually I just saw a documentary 

2096
01:28:35,530 --> 01:28:35,530
that was on pbs.

2097
01:28:35,530 --> 01:28:35,540
It was talking about the resurgence of 
lake eerie,

2098
01:28:35,750 --> 01:28:38,690
about how leakier they've worked very 
hard to filter out the water and they've

2099
01:28:38,691 --> 01:28:43,691
done all these different things to cut 
down the pollutants and they've seen a 

2100
01:28:43,691 --> 01:28:46,331
resurgence in the fish population.
And he got all fucking mad at me and I 

2101
01:28:46,611 --> 01:28:47,900
was like,
have you seen this documentary?

2102
01:28:47,920 --> 01:28:49,100
There's no,
this is not true.

2103
01:28:49,220 --> 01:28:50,510
And I'm like,
it's not true.

2104
01:28:50,511 --> 01:28:52,460
It's on pbs.
I watched it last night.

2105
01:28:52,760 --> 01:28:53,600
I'm like,
oh man,

2106
01:28:53,601 --> 01:28:54,830
all right.
so you're just like them.

2107
01:28:54,831 --> 01:28:56,900
So the next time we're in class,
um,

2108
01:28:57,110 --> 01:29:01,800
he had like these things that would pull
down like projection screens and I

2109
01:29:02,070 --> 01:29:07,070
pulled the projection screens up and I 
drew cartoons of him and then I,

2110
01:29:08,001 --> 01:29:10,670
I pulled the projection screens down.
Yeah,

2111
01:29:10,710 --> 01:29:13,470
I covered him.
So he went to draw on the chalkboard and

2112
01:29:13,471 --> 01:29:18,471
as you pulled the chalkboard up,
there's all these fucking cartoons of 

2113
01:29:18,471 --> 01:29:19,340
him saying wacky shit.
And he had this thing that he would do.

2114
01:29:19,620 --> 01:29:21,630
He would do this,
this crazy thing with his hands.

2115
01:29:21,631 --> 01:29:24,870
We would move his hands like this and 
then I have this other teacher Mr.

2116
01:29:24,870 --> 01:29:26,310
White,
and he was only like five foot two.

2117
01:29:26,400 --> 01:29:31,400
So I drew him all the time,
but every time I drew I drew him 

2118
01:29:31,400 --> 01:29:31,400
standing on something,

2119
01:29:31,400 --> 01:29:35,660
standing on a box or still in the other 
chair or sitting on a stool and I drew 

2120
01:29:35,660 --> 01:29:36,690
it just like him.
It's so funny,

2121
01:29:36,700 --> 01:29:37,050
dude.

2122
01:29:37,330 --> 01:29:42,330
and I had a one in anthropology teacher 
who was obsessed with jane goodall and 

2123
01:29:42,330 --> 01:29:42,790
the monkeys,
you know,

2124
01:29:42,791 --> 01:29:44,590
jane goodall lived live with 
chimpanzees.

2125
01:29:44,740 --> 01:29:47,890
So I drew this one kid who was a 
football player who was a nice kid,

2126
01:29:47,891 --> 01:29:49,990
but he was always kissing her ass 
because he wanted her to like him.

2127
01:29:50,140 --> 01:29:52,330
So you get better grades.
So I drew him,

2128
01:29:52,420 --> 01:29:55,480
banging her and like if I can look like 
her,

2129
01:29:55,481 --> 01:29:57,660
it looked like him and I drew him back 
at her say,

2130
01:29:57,670 --> 01:29:58,450
you know,
she was like,

2131
01:29:58,451 --> 01:29:59,650
oh,
give it to me monkeys.

2132
01:29:59,920 --> 01:30:02,760
I passed it around the class,
you know,

2133
01:30:03,090 --> 01:30:06,900
like I got suspended on two separate 
occasions for drawing cartoons.

2134
01:30:07,590 --> 01:30:12,590
I got sent home for trying.
That's the only thing I would normally 

2135
01:30:12,590 --> 01:30:12,590
get in trouble for him.
I did the same things,

2136
01:30:12,590 --> 01:30:16,350
but with overhead projectors I would 
like penis as there was an indian guy in

2137
01:30:16,351 --> 01:30:18,690
our class.
I'd always make fun of his parts because

2138
01:30:18,691 --> 01:30:21,990
he had really bad farts and then one 
time they pulled the whole class out and

2139
01:30:21,991 --> 01:30:23,090
they're like,
all right,

2140
01:30:23,340 --> 01:30:28,340
omar has really bad gas because of his 
diet and it's not funny and if you guys 

2141
01:30:29,401 --> 01:30:34,401
make fun of it anymore,
you guys are all going to be in trouble 

2142
01:30:34,401 --> 01:30:37,131
and I remember this speech,
so of course then I only drew only for 

2143
01:30:37,131 --> 01:30:41,271
the rest of the year.
I draw this indian guy heart and on 

2144
01:30:41,271 --> 01:30:41,271
people and stuff like that.
How ridiculous is that you,

2145
01:30:41,290 --> 01:30:44,870
you tell them kids not to make fun of 
farts because it's not fun.

2146
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:50,600
How disingenuous is that?
You cannot tell someone that farts are 

2147
01:30:50,600 --> 01:30:51,060
funny.
As soon as you say farts are funny,

2148
01:30:51,270 --> 01:30:53,860
I'm not listening to you because you're 
not being honest with you.

2149
01:30:54,060 --> 01:30:57,670
You can say farts don't smell.
Can you imagine if he loves fire?

2150
01:30:57,720 --> 01:31:00,720
It's the people that do this,
like fart porn.

2151
01:31:00,721 --> 01:31:03,390
Have you ever seen fart?
Fart porn?

2152
01:31:03,391 --> 01:31:08,391
We're dudes.
get their head right and girls' faces 

2153
01:31:08,391 --> 01:31:08,391
and girls fart in their mouth.
God,

2154
01:31:08,391 --> 01:31:09,180
I've got such a hard on now.

2155
01:31:13,050 --> 01:31:16,350
We've talked about this before about how
your farts smell awesome,

2156
01:31:16,351 --> 01:31:19,650
but other people's foreign military,
your farts smell the bat.

2157
01:31:19,680 --> 01:31:22,860
Except once in awhile,
one lets out and you're like ashamed.

2158
01:31:23,540 --> 01:31:26,190
I had one the other daY was never not 
wanted by myself,

2159
01:31:26,580 --> 01:31:28,720
by myself until it was like,
oh,

2160
01:31:28,790 --> 01:31:31,110
smell my own farts and enjoyment.
Everybody does that.

2161
01:31:31,170 --> 01:31:33,090
I think even girls do that.
They just don't want to admit it.

2162
01:31:33,330 --> 01:31:36,270
Girls cut,
but what is that?

2163
01:31:36,271 --> 01:31:36,810
I mean,
why?

2164
01:31:36,840 --> 01:31:38,040
Why is there an evolution?
I mean,

2165
01:31:38,041 --> 01:31:39,900
it's got to be something if everyone 
does it,

2166
01:31:39,901 --> 01:31:44,901
like what is it?
I think it's like your body sending out 

2167
01:31:44,901 --> 01:31:45,170
like a spray from mating,
but probably from acclimation.

2168
01:31:48,050 --> 01:31:53,050
Literally ridiculous theory.
Knock up and get pregnant is stick your 

2169
01:31:55,010 --> 01:31:59,990
dick fucking awesome.
I want to make myself what?

2170
01:32:00,090 --> 01:32:05,090
No,
but why do you think that people like 

2171
01:32:05,090 --> 01:32:05,090
their own forks?
Why is that a,

2172
01:32:05,090 --> 01:32:09,560
that sketch?
It's like it's it's food that you ate 

2173
01:32:09,560 --> 01:32:10,260
already,
so this guy says it's called peaker.

2174
01:32:10,270 --> 01:32:11,710
The urge to eat,
smell,

2175
01:32:11,760 --> 01:32:13,300
eat random things.
I thought,

2176
01:32:13,301 --> 01:32:14,980
I think people,
yeah,

2177
01:32:15,380 --> 01:32:20,380
it's people that have mineral 
deficiencies to the point where they're 

2178
01:32:20,380 --> 01:32:22,360
the paint dirt and the other day how 
weird that would be.

2179
01:32:22,361 --> 01:32:24,400
Eating dirt,
just like craving it like,

2180
01:32:24,401 --> 01:32:26,560
I need this tO her.
can you imagine?

2181
01:32:26,620 --> 01:32:27,780
Well,
you're kidding.

2182
01:32:28,230 --> 01:32:33,230
Could easily be wired wrong.
You think about all the different 

2183
01:32:33,230 --> 01:32:36,641
connections inside people's brains.
Now think of people like my friend john 

2184
01:32:36,641 --> 01:32:37,280
jacques machado,
my original jujitsu instructor,

2185
01:32:38,090 --> 01:32:41,900
he was born without his one hand,
his left hand.

2186
01:32:42,080 --> 01:32:47,080
He doesn't have all of his fingers.
His left hand only has like a thumb and 

2187
01:32:48,171 --> 01:32:49,640
like nubs,
you knoW,

2188
01:32:49,790 --> 01:32:52,700
and that's how he was born.
Deficient some.

2189
01:32:53,200 --> 01:32:55,280
I mean,
I don't know what it was exactly.

2190
01:32:55,281 --> 01:32:57,830
Some sort of a disease,
but he's born without fingers.

2191
01:32:58,130 --> 01:33:01,400
If you're born without fingers,
you could be born with crazy connections

2192
01:33:01,401 --> 01:33:03,440
in your head that make you love other 
people's farts.

2193
01:33:03,441 --> 01:33:04,130
You know,
you could be,

2194
01:33:04,160 --> 01:33:06,260
you know what I'm saying?
I mean it's possible.

2195
01:33:06,261 --> 01:33:09,980
I mean we look at like autism and what 
they don't understand about autism,

2196
01:33:09,981 --> 01:33:12,470
but some people who have autism can do 
crazy things.

2197
01:33:12,471 --> 01:33:17,471
Like there's a child that can see a 
place like lists look out the window at 

2198
01:33:18,451 --> 01:33:19,040
a,
at a,

2199
01:33:19,041 --> 01:33:24,041
like a city,
and then draw the city and exact detail 

2200
01:33:24,041 --> 01:33:26,020
like down to the fucking street signs 
and down to the alleyways.

2201
01:33:26,030 --> 01:33:27,200
I mean,
incredible.

2202
01:33:27,201 --> 01:33:29,840
There's,
there's videos of a online doing it.

2203
01:33:29,841 --> 01:33:33,740
I mean he can just look at an image of a
place or go to a place and see something

2204
01:33:33,890 --> 01:33:36,140
and just completely recreated in his 
mind and it's,

2205
01:33:36,350 --> 01:33:38,750
he has a version of autism,
you know,

2206
01:33:38,751 --> 01:33:41,150
it's like the whole rain man thing.
It's like,

2207
01:33:41,151 --> 01:33:42,080
what is that?
Like,

2208
01:33:42,130 --> 01:33:43,180
what,
how,

2209
01:33:43,210 --> 01:33:48,210
you know,
what the fuCk is going on that you can 

2210
01:33:48,210 --> 01:33:49,910
see something and record it like exactly
what you and I have no chance.

2211
01:33:50,090 --> 01:33:55,090
I mean if I had a drama backyard,
it will be all off and I've been in my 

2212
01:33:55,090 --> 01:33:58,961
backyard and fucking thousand times.
But if I had to draw it would be all 

2213
01:33:58,961 --> 01:33:59,100
fucking wanky.
You know,

2214
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:00,780
what the fuck is that?
I know.

2215
01:34:00,781 --> 01:34:02,550
It's really weird.
I know a friend that.

2216
01:34:02,670 --> 01:34:06,180
Is that a friend's uncle is that I met 
him once,

2217
01:34:07,180 --> 01:34:10,260
I met him once and he's always like 
talking about like how he used to sit on

2218
01:34:10,261 --> 01:34:12,780
his mom's shoulders during parades and 
stuff like that.

2219
01:34:12,810 --> 01:34:17,760
He met me once though and then every 
year he can't stop exactly.

2220
01:34:17,761 --> 01:34:19,860
Talking about me to her.
Like she's like,

2221
01:34:19,950 --> 01:34:22,120
where's brian?
And brian said he was going to the store

2222
01:34:22,190 --> 01:34:24,750
one one and like,
like remember everything about me,

2223
01:34:24,780 --> 01:34:26,680
he buys me gifts,
you know,

2224
01:34:26,790 --> 01:34:30,730
we broke up a long time ago.
She's like duty by guests and,

2225
01:34:30,770 --> 01:34:33,750
and he knows everything about you not 
stop talking about you,

2226
01:34:33,751 --> 01:34:34,200
but then

2227
01:34:34,250 --> 01:34:39,250
wow,
so we're doing to fuck you did one in 

2228
01:34:39,250 --> 01:34:39,280
me.
That's strange man.

2229
01:34:39,281 --> 01:34:42,340
I mean it's like the potential of the 
human mind,

2230
01:34:42,341 --> 01:34:43,960
you know?
Do you think it's because they,

2231
01:34:44,030 --> 01:34:49,030
there's obviously something,
some sort of a disconnect socially that 

2232
01:34:49,030 --> 01:34:52,530
with people that have autism,
do you think it's sort of like one of 

2233
01:34:52,530 --> 01:34:53,320
those things where people who can't see 
can hear incredibly.

2234
01:34:53,830 --> 01:34:55,210
You know,
it's like when you were,

2235
01:34:55,211 --> 01:34:58,670
you were missing one sense.
Your other senses like supercharged?

2236
01:34:59,240 --> 01:34:59,780
Yeah,
I just,

2237
01:34:59,800 --> 01:35:04,800
I,
I don't know because sometimes I think 

2238
01:35:04,800 --> 01:35:05,720
things like that or I think what if he 
knows exactly everything that's going on

2239
01:35:05,721 --> 01:35:10,721
but his mouth doesn't work.
Kind of like when you're so fucked up 

2240
01:35:10,721 --> 01:35:10,721
and you're trying to say something.
If it was like,

2241
01:35:10,750 --> 01:35:12,300
you can't have your,
you know,

2242
01:35:12,380 --> 01:35:16,340
what you're thinking out in maybe.
And I'm like,

2243
01:35:16,400 --> 01:35:17,090
that's it.
That's it.

2244
01:35:17,140 --> 01:35:19,630
There an affectionate.
That's the thing with them though.

2245
01:35:19,640 --> 01:35:22,730
There's a social disconnect and a real 
disconnect

2246
01:35:23,240 --> 01:35:25,370
where they don't,
they don't express themselves,

2247
01:35:25,371 --> 01:35:30,371
they don't smile as much,
don't make eye contact as much as other 

2248
01:35:30,371 --> 01:35:30,371
kids do,
you know?

2249
01:35:30,371 --> 01:35:34,250
but in so doing that and in doing that 
they have this incredible focus.

2250
01:35:34,460 --> 01:35:39,460
Like I have a friend whose child,
his son has a mild form of asperger's,

2251
01:35:39,531 --> 01:35:43,430
was like an autism type of thing and his
son is a jujitsu wizard.

2252
01:35:43,460 --> 01:35:46,220
The kids or an assassin.
I mean he's really,

2253
01:35:46,221 --> 01:35:47,340
really fucking good.
Like,

2254
01:35:47,580 --> 01:35:49,940
like goes at a head to head with like 
world champions.

2255
01:35:49,941 --> 01:35:51,350
He's like really,
really good.

2256
01:35:51,500 --> 01:35:56,500
And one of the reasons why it's really 
good is he has this intense ability to 

2257
01:35:56,500 --> 01:35:57,610
focus on things and you know,
he's not so good socially,

2258
01:35:57,620 --> 01:36:00,830
doesn't have a girlfriend,
not so good at like having buddies.

2259
01:36:01,130 --> 01:36:02,900
But goddamn you get on the mat with that
motherfucker,

2260
01:36:02,901 --> 01:36:07,901
he remembers every move and he's 
countering your moves and advancing and 

2261
01:36:07,901 --> 01:36:07,901
moving forward.

2262
01:36:07,901 --> 01:36:10,130
And he taps like really high level black
belts all the time.

2263
01:36:10,730 --> 01:36:15,730
You know,
it's like autistic doesn't necessarily 

2264
01:36:15,730 --> 01:36:15,730
mean super,
super intelligent,

2265
01:36:15,730 --> 01:36:19,430
doesn't necessarily mean you know,
some sort of a rain man type genius.

2266
01:36:19,431 --> 01:36:22,640
But it has the potential it.
Which makes me think,

2267
01:36:22,641 --> 01:36:24,320
I wonder if it's,
you know,

2268
01:36:24,530 --> 01:36:27,020
almost like there's so many people that 
are autistic dude.

2269
01:36:27,021 --> 01:36:29,270
It's like one out of 100 now,
you know,

2270
01:36:29,330 --> 01:36:34,010
and it's advancing over the years.
I wonder if it's possible that,

2271
01:36:34,040 --> 01:36:39,040
you know,
I mean people say that it's due to 

2272
01:36:39,040 --> 01:36:39,040
environmental conditions.
It could be due to pollution,

2273
01:36:39,040 --> 01:36:43,690
it could be due to diet,
it could be due to the hormones in our 

2274
01:36:43,690 --> 01:36:45,560
food.
There's a bunch of different theories on

2275
01:36:45,561 --> 01:36:50,561
what causes autism.
But if it's happening in much greater 

2276
01:36:50,561 --> 01:36:55,061
numbers than it ever has before,
and that's debatable as well because 

2277
01:36:55,061 --> 01:36:55,061
some people say it's not.

2278
01:36:55,061 --> 01:36:58,990
There's just more people are diagnosed 
as being autistic now because they've 

2279
01:36:58,990 --> 01:36:58,990
changed the diagnosis.
But that's,

2280
01:36:58,990 --> 01:37:03,380
that's under debate as well.
But what if it's sort of a next stage of

2281
01:37:03,381 --> 01:37:06,740
evolution would have emotions and 
dealing with,

2282
01:37:06,940 --> 01:37:09,320
you know,
the way a human beings.

2283
01:37:09,340 --> 01:37:14,340
I've always beeN like really emotional 
and what if that's not going to be 

2284
01:37:14,340 --> 01:37:17,711
necessary in the future.
what if that's slowly being phased out 

2285
01:37:17,711 --> 01:37:21,550
because human beings don't have to use 
our fight or flight reflexes and 

2286
01:37:21,550 --> 01:37:26,111
instincts anymore because you know,
we're not running from saber tooth 

2287
01:37:26,111 --> 01:37:26,111
tigers and shed.
Basically.

2288
01:37:26,111 --> 01:37:30,640
We're just dealing with civilized 
society and that society becomes more 

2289
01:37:30,640 --> 01:37:32,390
and more civilized and as society 
becomes more and more modern,

2290
01:37:32,570 --> 01:37:36,260
more people are born with this 
detachment from emotions.

2291
01:37:36,650 --> 01:37:41,650
And one of the reasons why I thought 
this is because of amish people and 

2292
01:37:42,110 --> 01:37:46,760
amish people live their life in a very 
traditional old school,

2293
01:37:46,761 --> 01:37:47,880
sort of a word.
And it,

2294
01:37:47,900 --> 01:37:50,020
it's kind of a fucked up wacky religion.
But you know,

2295
01:37:50,030 --> 01:37:55,030
they drove around the horse driven 
buggies and they build their own houses 

2296
01:37:55,030 --> 01:37:55,990
and you know,
and I don't know if

2297
01:37:55,990 --> 01:37:58,740
they even use electricity to some of 
these women use electricity,

2298
01:37:58,741 --> 01:38:03,741
some of them driving a regular car,
some of them have real jobs and they're 

2299
01:38:03,741 --> 01:38:04,000
amish.
It just depends on what kind of learners

2300
01:38:04,020 --> 01:38:04,960
they are.
But,

2301
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:10,000
but the whole premise originally was 
that these people lived like a certain 

2302
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:11,760
group of people hundreds of years ago.
Well,

2303
01:38:11,761 --> 01:38:13,350
they have a much,
much,

2304
01:38:13,351 --> 01:38:17,410
much lower.
I'm a history or much,

2305
01:38:17,640 --> 01:38:20,430
much lower numbers of autistic children,
much lower.

2306
01:38:20,490 --> 01:38:24,030
It might be just something like cell 
phones and the signals are cell phones,

2307
01:38:24,340 --> 01:38:27,030
beepers and,
and all this shit that started making it

2308
01:38:27,031 --> 01:38:29,160
increase orange,
just like splenda,

2309
01:38:29,310 --> 01:38:34,310
you know,
it could be something we're not even 

2310
01:38:34,310 --> 01:38:34,310
thinking about it.
We don't know.

2311
01:38:34,310 --> 01:38:37,311
And that's what skip aspartame,
aspartame and shit like that could 

2312
01:38:37,311 --> 01:38:38,360
easily be.
We don't know the only way to do that.

2313
01:38:38,370 --> 01:38:40,050
You know,
there's a lot of theories about,

2314
01:38:40,051 --> 01:38:40,800
you know,
um,

2315
01:38:40,860 --> 01:38:43,350
you know,
people say that a lot of people,

2316
01:38:43,351 --> 01:38:48,351
there's a lot of anecdotal evidence 
about vaccinations and there's a lot of 

2317
01:38:48,351 --> 01:38:51,471
people say there's no scientific 
connection whatsoever and people always 

2318
01:38:51,471 --> 01:38:51,810
want to jump on that and you know,
your tinfoil hat.

2319
01:38:51,811 --> 01:38:52,610
But this whole thing about

2320
01:38:52,660 --> 01:38:54,280
autism,
what people don't realize,

2321
01:38:54,281 --> 01:38:59,281
there's thousands of people have been 
paid off by the autism court of America 

2322
01:38:59,281 --> 01:39:04,170
because of a,
I don't remember the exact title of the 

2323
01:39:04,170 --> 01:39:04,170
court,
but I believe it is autism court,

2324
01:39:04,170 --> 01:39:04,780
uh,
not autism core,

2325
01:39:04,781 --> 01:39:06,250
excuse me,
vaccination court,

2326
01:39:06,700 --> 01:39:07,850
like the vac.
Let me,

2327
01:39:07,980 --> 01:39:10,900
let me find the exact number in the 
exact,

2328
01:39:10,901 --> 01:39:14,740
a theory because I'm one of the 
kennedy's,

2329
01:39:14,741 --> 01:39:19,741
I think Robert Kennedy jr is a heavily 
involved in this shit and a lot of 

2330
01:39:19,741 --> 01:39:22,920
people have been paid off by vaccine 
court because a,

2331
01:39:22,950 --> 01:39:25,950
and it's in the thousands of families 
because of their,

2332
01:39:25,951 --> 01:39:29,710
their children suffering from brain 
damage after being vaccinated,

2333
01:39:29,711 --> 01:39:34,711
that they had brain swelling and brain 
damage and they received sizable a 

2334
01:39:34,711 --> 01:39:35,230
rewards from the courts.
Now,

2335
01:39:35,231 --> 01:39:39,970
if that's really true,
how do we not know that you know you,

2336
01:39:39,971 --> 01:39:42,430
you're not damaging other shit with 
vaccinations,

2337
01:39:42,431 --> 01:39:47,431
especially like heavy duty vaccinations 
with through marisol and all that stuff 

2338
01:39:47,431 --> 01:39:47,431
that's been linked.

2339
01:39:47,431 --> 01:39:48,520
I mean the stuff that they've removed 
from,

2340
01:39:48,660 --> 01:39:53,660
from vaccines,
it's a real heavy debated issue because 

2341
01:39:53,660 --> 01:39:55,690
people don't want to thank a few people 
have had their children vaccinated.

2342
01:39:55,840 --> 01:40:00,840
They don't want to think that they've 
done anything wrong to their children 

2343
01:40:00,840 --> 01:40:00,840
and people have children that are 
autistic.

2344
01:40:00,840 --> 01:40:03,070
They want to blame someone and so they 
try to blame the vaccination.

2345
01:40:03,071 --> 01:40:04,430
But the bottom line is,
you know,

2346
01:40:04,450 --> 01:40:09,450
you're injecting chemicals into your 
baby when you're not even supposed to 

2347
01:40:09,450 --> 01:40:12,661
give kids fucking peanut butter.
You're not even supposed to give babies 

2348
01:40:12,661 --> 01:40:13,210
peanut butter because they might have a 
peanut allergy,

2349
01:40:13,480 --> 01:40:16,030
but yet you can shoot them up with all 
these fucking chemicals.

2350
01:40:16,360 --> 01:40:17,470
you know?
I don't know.

2351
01:40:17,530 --> 01:40:20,170
You know,
this whole jenny mccarthy debate.

2352
01:40:20,171 --> 01:40:25,171
No,
and then she's running around saying 

2353
01:40:25,171 --> 01:40:25,171
that vaccinations cause autism to the 
kids,

2354
01:40:25,171 --> 01:40:29,611
but I have friends that say their kids 
were more and we have a friend that we 

2355
01:40:29,611 --> 01:40:32,611
know that his kid got the measles,
mumps and rubella and then instantly was

2356
01:40:33,161 --> 01:40:35,950
different,
like instantly became detached,

2357
01:40:36,130 --> 01:40:38,350
got fucking weird and,
and,

2358
01:40:38,351 --> 01:40:42,400
and the kid has some serious autism now 
whether or not it's connected or whether

2359
01:40:42,401 --> 01:40:47,401
or not he had a preexisting condition 
that was exacerbated by those 

2360
01:40:47,401 --> 01:40:47,401
vaccinations.

2361
01:40:47,401 --> 01:40:51,840
That's possible as well.
But who the fuck knows what's causing 

2362
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:52,090
all this shit?
It could be,

2363
01:40:52,270 --> 01:40:53,800
you know,
just the of pollution,

2364
01:40:53,801 --> 01:40:56,500
the higher levels of carbon dioxide in 
the air.

2365
01:40:56,501 --> 01:40:57,620
It could be,
you know,

2366
01:40:57,640 --> 01:41:00,040
the preservatives in food.
It could be,

2367
01:41:00,041 --> 01:41:01,360
you know,
it could be a bunch of shit,

2368
01:41:01,660 --> 01:41:06,660
but it also could be the civilization.
It could be the fact that as 

2369
01:41:06,660 --> 01:41:09,510
civilization progress is the need to 
have all these emotions and the need to,

2370
01:41:09,590 --> 01:41:12,940
to exist the way people have always 
existed as is morphing.

2371
01:41:13,120 --> 01:41:14,410
It's changing.
You know,

2372
01:41:14,411 --> 01:41:16,570
we're going to be like fucking aliens.
I mean,

2373
01:41:16,571 --> 01:41:21,571
if you think about like all the 
depictions of aliens and a science 

2374
01:41:21,571 --> 01:41:21,610
fiction,
the advanced aliens,

2375
01:41:21,611 --> 01:41:24,460
they're always super unemotional.
Take me to your leader,

2376
01:41:24,490 --> 01:41:25,840
you know,
it's like that type of shit.

2377
01:41:25,930 --> 01:41:30,930
It's like we kind of inherently know 
that emotions are sort of holding back 

2378
01:41:30,930 --> 01:41:34,150
progress and as human beings become 
super technical or super,

2379
01:41:34,180 --> 01:41:39,180
super technologically evolved,
that eventually we're going to get to a 

2380
01:41:39,180 --> 01:41:40,600
point where we're not irrational and 
emotional,

2381
01:41:40,800 --> 01:41:45,800
you know?
And you think about like the shit that 

2382
01:41:45,800 --> 01:41:45,800
happened with that crazy girl that got 
you arrested.

2383
01:41:45,800 --> 01:41:45,800
LIke what?
What was that?

2384
01:41:45,800 --> 01:41:48,070
It's nutty emotions like chaos and 
emotions,

2385
01:41:48,370 --> 01:41:50,040
you know,
you think about almost all murder.

2386
01:41:50,220 --> 01:41:55,220
Why japanese people never have domestic 
violence issues or have any issues to 

2387
01:41:58,171 --> 01:42:01,290
support this one.
I mean,

2388
01:42:01,330 --> 01:42:01,620
I'm,

2389
01:42:03,300 --> 01:42:04,080
you know,
but,

2390
01:42:04,081 --> 01:42:07,020
but you think about that like when,
when we think about like alien life,

2391
01:42:07,021 --> 01:42:08,760
super advanced alien life,
you know,

2392
01:42:09,180 --> 01:42:14,180
the guy from the day the earth stood 
still was always super stoic and 

2393
01:42:14,180 --> 01:42:17,511
unemotional and you know,
I mean we kind of inherently know that 

2394
01:42:17,611 --> 01:42:19,800
that is the future.
That that's where we're headed.

2395
01:42:19,801 --> 01:42:21,990
And that's autism.
I mean,

2396
01:42:21,991 --> 01:42:26,991
it's kind of a fucked up thing to think,
but I mean maybe all these people like 

2397
01:42:26,991 --> 01:42:29,940
one out of 100 have autism and the 
debate as to whether or not it's been,

2398
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:30,970
you know,
just do,

2399
01:42:30,971 --> 01:42:34,380
they've changed the diagnosis.
I don't know if that's the case and I'll

2400
01:42:34,381 --> 01:42:34,860
take,
you know,

2401
01:42:34,861 --> 01:42:36,810
either it debate as to what is causing 
it,

2402
01:42:36,811 --> 01:42:40,470
but the only way you know what's causing
it as you take the exact same biological

2403
01:42:40,471 --> 01:42:42,960
human being,
you do a bunch of shit to him.

2404
01:42:43,110 --> 01:42:45,210
He has autIsm,
you go back in time,

2405
01:42:45,211 --> 01:42:47,580
you try it without the shit you see.
If he develops autism,

2406
01:42:47,581 --> 01:42:48,840
you'd,
you start removing things.

2407
01:42:48,990 --> 01:42:51,140
other than that,
I mean it's just speculation when you're

2408
01:42:51,141 --> 01:42:53,520
dealing with these kinds of numbers.
One out of 100.

2409
01:42:53,521 --> 01:42:55,500
I mean that's,
these are pretty significant numbers.

2410
01:42:55,770 --> 01:42:57,310
You know,
you have a thousand people.

2411
01:42:57,311 --> 01:42:59,070
Do you have 100 autistic kids?
You know,

2412
01:42:59,071 --> 01:43:00,990
that's not a man.
That's crazy.

2413
01:43:00,991 --> 01:43:03,220
Got $100.
it a lot of god damn paper.

2414
01:43:03,390 --> 01:43:06,460
Have you ever seen retard porn?
Are there is a retard point?

2415
01:43:06,530 --> 01:43:09,110
You're seeing it.
What if they do retard fart porn that

2416
01:43:09,350 --> 01:43:11,580
oh,
retard fart porn be awesome.

2417
01:43:12,480 --> 01:43:13,980
No,
it's weird because like retard,

2418
01:43:14,240 --> 01:43:16,320
like you feel like you're watching 
something illegal,

2419
01:43:16,321 --> 01:43:17,100
but then you're like,
wait,

2420
01:43:17,101 --> 01:43:18,960
this isn't an adult.
But then you're like,

2421
01:43:18,961 --> 01:43:19,800
wait,
he doesn't really know.

2422
01:43:19,801 --> 01:43:24,120
He's getting fucked with a dildo and his
asshole dude,

2423
01:43:24,210 --> 01:43:29,210
I saw something the other day,
so I'm hardcore retard porn where this 

2424
01:43:29,210 --> 01:43:33,380
girl who was also retarded but shoving a
dildo up his retarded guys asshole and 

2425
01:43:33,810 --> 01:43:37,110
the girl seemed like more retarded.
But the guy,

2426
01:43:37,390 --> 01:43:38,640
I don't know,
it's so weird.

2427
01:43:38,641 --> 01:43:42,270
And I started wanting to,
about how was awful.

2428
01:43:42,590 --> 01:43:44,400
Don't never watched it.
Don't ever watch it.

2429
01:43:44,470 --> 01:43:45,280
So,
you know,

2430
01:43:45,300 --> 01:43:47,910
that's the thing about which obviously 
we talked about porn,

2431
01:43:47,911 --> 01:43:52,911
like who buys porn today?
The problem is like fucking nobody's 

2432
01:43:52,911 --> 01:43:52,911
porn.

2433
01:43:52,911 --> 01:43:54,530
So to make money in porn,
they got to go deep.

2434
01:43:54,800 --> 01:43:55,460
Well,
you know,

2435
01:43:55,461 --> 01:44:00,461
porn,
it always has these walls that they hit 

2436
01:44:00,461 --> 01:44:00,461
and they always come out of it because 
the bottom line is,

2437
01:44:00,461 --> 01:44:01,250
uh,
there's always going to be porn.

2438
01:44:01,300 --> 01:44:06,300
You know?
How do you make money though when 

2439
01:44:06,300 --> 01:44:06,300
there's so much of it already on the 
inner,

2440
01:44:06,300 --> 01:44:07,430
you know,
it's really amazing how,

2441
01:44:07,490 --> 01:44:12,490
uh,
like movies and stuff like that or 

2442
01:44:12,490 --> 01:44:12,800
having a hard time getting their videos 
off the internet.

2443
01:44:12,980 --> 01:44:17,090
But if yOu tried to find like a movie,
like if you want to find this as certain

2444
01:44:17,091 --> 01:44:18,320
movie,
it was important.

2445
01:44:18,610 --> 01:44:20,990
A lot of these websites all work 
together like these,

2446
01:44:20,991 --> 01:44:23,710
these unicorns and stuff like that.
Like they'll give you a 30,

2447
01:44:23,880 --> 01:44:26,150
30 minute,
32nd clip or something like that,

2448
01:44:26,151 --> 01:44:31,151
but they're keeping the majority of 
their main movies off all these 

2449
01:44:31,151 --> 01:44:31,700
websites,
which I find really amazing.

2450
01:44:31,790 --> 01:44:33,200
What do you mean?
Like a.

2451
01:44:33,740 --> 01:44:37,760
If you're trying to find like a jenna 
jamison movie to our jenna jamison movie

2452
01:44:37,910 --> 01:44:42,910
compared to seeing avatar so you can get
an a bit torrent easily.

2453
01:44:43,851 --> 01:44:46,640
Yeah.
Not being know how many porn stars are,

2454
01:44:46,700 --> 01:44:51,700
are not on bit torrent,
but really it's not the same as as like 

2455
01:44:51,700 --> 01:44:51,700
pirate bay,
you know,

2456
01:44:51,700 --> 01:44:54,410
porn that harder to find bet you're 
wrong.

2457
01:44:54,440 --> 01:44:59,060
I bet if you go to newsgroups and shit,
I bet they trade shit at a rapid rate.

2458
01:44:59,061 --> 01:45:00,040
I think you're just not

2459
01:45:00,200 --> 01:45:02,800
obsessed.
Not there as much though,

2460
01:45:02,810 --> 01:45:07,810
is what I'm saying.
I mean you can go to pirate bay has a 

2461
01:45:07,810 --> 01:45:09,901
lot of porn.
They had porn porn but it's not pirate 

2462
01:45:09,901 --> 01:45:09,901
parties.
Not about porn though.

2463
01:45:09,901 --> 01:45:12,240
Morally about like where's and it's 
about movies,

2464
01:45:12,340 --> 01:45:13,480
music,
videos,

2465
01:45:13,481 --> 01:45:15,250
files about everything.
But it really is about.

2466
01:45:15,940 --> 01:45:17,400
But it's not the same percentage of 
porn,

2467
01:45:17,410 --> 01:45:19,670
like 25 percent of everything on the 
internet as porn over.

2468
01:45:19,671 --> 01:45:24,671
I'm just saying that the main thing that
porn is getting into the most I guess 

2469
01:45:24,671 --> 01:45:27,030
nowadays is having personal websites.
So if you find it,

2470
01:45:27,500 --> 01:45:32,500
if you have,
if you find a girl like so and so down 

2471
01:45:32,500 --> 01:45:32,500
the street,
yeah.

2472
01:45:32,500 --> 01:45:32,920
You become a member for nine bucks a 
month.

2473
01:45:32,990 --> 01:45:35,950
She gets hurt or her webcam just sitting
there playing with a bottle,

2474
01:45:36,040 --> 01:45:36,620
you know.
So yeah.

2475
01:45:36,660 --> 01:45:37,990
That's like the big deal,
right?

2476
01:45:37,991 --> 01:45:41,560
His webcam shows for those girls to a 
facebook page.

2477
01:45:41,590 --> 01:45:43,330
It's like that girl that's on our,
our um,

2478
01:45:43,380 --> 01:45:44,940
message board.
Crazy amber,

2479
01:45:45,240 --> 01:45:50,240
crazy.
Amber literally makes her living by 

2480
01:45:50,240 --> 01:45:50,240
doing like live webcam shows,

2481
01:45:50,460 --> 01:45:52,610
founders.
He's one of the first girls they ever do

2482
01:45:52,611 --> 01:45:56,580
hd video on the internet for porn.
She wrote about it on our website.

2483
01:45:56,590 --> 01:45:58,850
Remember she had like a press release 
like 60 years ago.

2484
01:46:01,540 --> 01:46:02,530
Yeah.
Yeah.

2485
01:46:02,540 --> 01:46:03,510
She's a pretty fucking.

2486
01:46:03,640 --> 01:46:07,200
She's heavily a tech check associated.
Yeah.

2487
01:46:07,260 --> 01:46:08,620
She's,
I don't know what everyone's doing.

2488
01:46:08,870 --> 01:46:09,880
It's crazy.
Crazy.

2489
01:46:09,881 --> 01:46:12,160

She's crazy.

2492
01:46:17,531 --> 01:46:19,690
Amber on the rogan board.
Um,

2493
01:46:19,810 --> 01:46:21,040
if you don't know what the rogan board 
is,

2494
01:46:21,041 --> 01:46:24,490
I got a forum that has like,
it's almost like $3 million.

2495
01:46:24,520 --> 01:46:27,400
It's up to posts on it.
So pretty wild for him.

2496
01:46:27,430 --> 01:46:30,190
Any fucked up news,
anything that's going on,

2497
01:46:30,191 --> 01:46:31,180
anything.
It's crazy.

2498
01:46:31,181 --> 01:46:33,680
Any new video that came out.
Anything that,

2499
01:46:34,060 --> 01:46:37,150
anything.
Bananas is on forums dot joe rogan.net.

2500
01:46:37,151 --> 01:46:42,151
The rogan board.
If you get on the board and you sign up 

2501
01:46:42,151 --> 01:46:42,151
and you could be a member,
anybody can be a member,

2502
01:46:42,151 --> 01:46:44,650
but if you're a dickhead,
if you going to retard,

2503
01:46:44,680 --> 01:46:45,870
we pink.
You look pink.

2504
01:46:45,880 --> 01:46:47,290
Hue is.
There's two forms.

2505
01:46:47,470 --> 01:46:52,470
There's one forum that's regular forum,
it's called shit talking one on one and 

2506
01:46:52,470 --> 01:46:53,430
there's another forum that's called 
special ed.

2507
01:46:53,550 --> 01:46:57,240
And what special ed is,
is when you are too fucked up,

2508
01:46:57,270 --> 01:47:00,660
you need too much attention because too 
much trouble.

2509
01:47:00,780 --> 01:47:02,550
You start fucking,
you know,

2510
01:47:02,580 --> 01:47:04,680
just harassing people and being 
annoying,

2511
01:47:04,681 --> 01:47:05,960
starting dumb argument,

2512
01:47:06,340 --> 01:47:08,020
stupid shit stocker.
I've noticed,

2513
01:47:08,021 --> 01:47:13,021
especially with twitter's a lot more 
creepy stalkers and I thought there was 

2514
01:47:13,021 --> 01:47:16,440
a bunch of out there that are fucking 
nuts and that you wouldn't ordinarily 

2515
01:47:16,440 --> 01:47:16,930
let them into your life.
And now because of the internet,

2516
01:47:16,931 --> 01:47:21,931
you know,
they get into your life and you've got 

2517
01:47:21,931 --> 01:47:21,931
to figure out a way to filter them.
You know what I mean?

2518
01:47:21,931 --> 01:47:23,950
Look,
sometimes we have this chat here and uh,

2519
01:47:23,951 --> 01:47:26,740
I look at the chat and sometimes people 
just constant

2520
01:47:26,760 --> 01:47:28,530
you saying dumb,
annoying,

2521
01:47:28,531 --> 01:47:32,010
stupid shit over and over and over and 
over and over again.

2522
01:47:32,160 --> 01:47:34,110
But the beautiful thing is you just 
click on them and ban them.

2523
01:47:34,410 --> 01:47:39,410
You know,
and that's the beautiful thing about 

2524
01:47:39,410 --> 01:47:39,410
twitter too,
like some people,

2525
01:47:39,410 --> 01:47:39,410
well,
twitter,

2526
01:47:39,410 --> 01:47:40,100
you stupid shit and all they're trying 
to do is get your attention.

2527
01:47:40,430 --> 01:47:45,430
That's what's scary is like there's a 
few people that they wake up from the 

2528
01:47:45,430 --> 01:47:49,160
morning to sleep every three minutes 
writing a message and you're like,

2529
01:47:49,161 --> 01:47:51,040
tHis is what this person is on the 
message board.

2530
01:47:51,290 --> 01:47:53,350
No,
like on twitter and I,

2531
01:47:53,770 --> 01:47:55,850
some of these people really creep me the
fuck.

2532
01:47:55,870 --> 01:47:56,840
Well,
it's given them a direct

2533
01:47:56,860 --> 01:47:57,400
action.
Two,

2534
01:47:57,401 --> 01:47:59,560
it's given some people like something to
do,

2535
01:47:59,620 --> 01:48:01,840
something to look forward to.
They get to interact with,

2536
01:48:01,870 --> 01:48:03,340
you know all these different human 
beings.

2537
01:48:03,390 --> 01:48:08,390
Yeah.
Like that little girl that you guys 

2538
01:48:08,390 --> 01:48:08,390
always talk about.
What are you doing?

2539
01:48:08,390 --> 01:48:11,790
Talking.
She fucking has the one sided 

2540
01:48:11,790 --> 01:48:12,960
conversations.
He's been trying to fuck me for the last

2541
01:48:12,961 --> 01:48:13,980
two months.
This fucker.

2542
01:48:13,981 --> 01:48:16,350
Dude,
why are you not said one word to her,

2543
01:48:16,351 --> 01:48:18,420
but every,
every day.

2544
01:48:18,710 --> 01:48:23,710
See your face.
How are we going to pop some fellow she 

2545
01:48:23,710 --> 01:48:24,600
wants.
I don't see anything wrong with.

2546
01:48:24,610 --> 01:48:28,110
It is called,
which is for young lady.

2547
01:48:28,150 --> 01:48:29,100
I don't know.
It's funny.

2548
01:48:29,101 --> 01:48:34,101
It's like I,
I followed her sometimes and she's like 

2549
01:48:34,101 --> 01:48:36,621
having full on conversations with jenna 
jamison right back and forth and I'm 

2550
01:48:36,621 --> 01:48:36,621
like,
that's fine.

2551
01:48:36,621 --> 01:48:40,020
It goes back and forth with this.
What do you think of the golden

2552
01:48:40,020 --> 01:48:41,470
goldman sachs case?
Do you know about that?

2553
01:48:41,471 --> 01:48:43,690
Do you go there?
You know what golden sachs is now?

2554
01:48:43,720 --> 01:48:48,720
Goldman sachs is a gigantic bank that's 
getting sued now by the federal 

2555
01:48:48,720 --> 01:48:48,720
government is actually looking into 
them.

2556
01:48:48,720 --> 01:48:49,560
They're going to bring them to court and
they're gonna.

2557
01:48:49,720 --> 01:48:54,720
They're gonna.
Try them and figure out how the fuck 

2558
01:48:54,720 --> 01:48:54,970
they defraud people.
They shorted.

2559
01:48:55,300 --> 01:48:58,180
What they did was they sold people a 
bunch of,

2560
01:48:58,181 --> 01:49:03,181
uh,
they told people to buy things and then 

2561
01:49:03,181 --> 01:49:05,611
they banked against it.
So they told people that we're shorting 

2562
01:49:05,611 --> 01:49:06,580
means is like,
say if you decide that,

2563
01:49:06,581 --> 01:49:07,480
uh,
you know,

2564
01:49:07,481 --> 01:49:08,860
uh,
you look at the market and you say,

2565
01:49:08,861 --> 01:49:10,450
okay,
this company is going to take a shit.

2566
01:49:10,451 --> 01:49:15,451
They're going to fall apart,
but you keep selling that company to 

2567
01:49:15,451 --> 01:49:15,910
your clients.
You keep telling them,

2568
01:49:15,911 --> 01:49:20,911
hey,
you should invest in this company 

2569
01:49:20,911 --> 01:49:20,911
because this company is a good 
investment.

2570
01:49:20,911 --> 01:49:24,630
But meanwhile you're shorting,
which means you're betting that that 

2571
01:49:24,630 --> 01:49:25,450
company is going to fail on the side.
And they made tons of money.

2572
01:49:25,451 --> 01:49:30,451
They basically fucked over their 
customers and manipulated the whole 

2573
01:49:30,451 --> 01:49:32,970
system and made fucking hundreds of 
billions of dollars for this and there's

2574
01:49:32,971 --> 01:49:37,971
this guy matt taibbi,
who's been writing about this in wall 

2575
01:49:37,971 --> 01:49:40,330
street in a rolling stone magazine,
fascinating and infuriating articles all

2576
01:49:40,331 --> 01:49:45,331
about the corruption.
It's involved in wall street and it's 

2577
01:49:45,331 --> 01:49:48,220
fucking mind blowing that they can still
pull that shit in 2010.

2578
01:49:48,700 --> 01:49:50,420
You know,
this is one thing that I sit on stage to

2579
01:49:50,421 --> 01:49:52,180
stage this weekend.
I've been talking about this a lot.

2580
01:49:52,320 --> 01:49:54,550
Like you know when people talk about,
well you don't understand the economy is

2581
01:49:54,551 --> 01:49:56,530
complicated and here's what I don't 
understand.

2582
01:49:56,531 --> 01:49:58,150
There's the same amount of fucking 
people.

2583
01:49:58,360 --> 01:50:00,040
Okay.
There's the same amount of shit,

2584
01:50:00,160 --> 01:50:02,910
the same amount of metal st,
amount of materials,

2585
01:50:02,920 --> 01:50:04,750
the same amount of people buying things.

2586
01:50:04,870 --> 01:50:07,900
Where the fuck did all the money go?
What happened?

2587
01:50:08,560 --> 01:50:13,560
Well good though the stoCk market 
crashed and the housIng market was 

2588
01:50:13,560 --> 01:50:15,520
inflated and fell upon.
What the fuck are you eating?

2589
01:50:15,521 --> 01:50:20,521
Saying what does that mean?
To me that means that the system is 

2590
01:50:20,521 --> 01:50:23,941
bullshit.
It means the whole system is fucking 

2591
01:50:23,941 --> 01:50:26,461
nuts.
I think everyone knows that system is 

2592
01:50:26,461 --> 01:50:28,231
bullshit there.
I don't know why he says it's not that 

2593
01:50:28,231 --> 01:50:30,571
I'm surprised,
but I'm surprised of is that it keeps 

2594
01:50:30,571 --> 01:50:30,571
going.
We've talked about this before,

2595
01:50:30,571 --> 01:50:35,020
that our system is like our culture,
our system of government is like windows

2596
01:50:35,021 --> 01:50:40,021
98 and then the windows 95 was like 100 
viruses and we're just throwing patches 

2597
01:50:40,031 --> 01:50:41,220
at it,
trying to fix things,

2598
01:50:41,230 --> 01:50:43,690
trying to work around stuff,
but that's really what it's like.

2599
01:50:43,691 --> 01:50:48,691
It's like this ancient fucking stupid 
system that doesn't work and it crashes 

2600
01:50:49,001 --> 01:50:52,060
all the time and it's got all these bugs
and it's filled with corruption,

2601
01:50:52,540 --> 01:50:52,900
you know?

2602
01:50:52,900 --> 01:50:56,320
And yet still there's,
there's no solutions for it.

2603
01:50:56,470 --> 01:50:58,910
Move to an island.
What can you do it?

2604
01:51:00,050 --> 01:51:05,050
You can't even move son.
What are you going to do over there for 

2605
01:51:05,050 --> 01:51:05,050
work?
Going to fucking pick coconuts.

2606
01:51:05,080 --> 01:51:06,380
How about you?
Going back to manual.

2607
01:51:06,960 --> 01:51:11,920
You have people to talk about how they 
hate society the way it is right now.

2608
01:51:12,010 --> 01:51:15,340
You would be so fucking happy if you 
move to an island.

2609
01:51:15,341 --> 01:51:17,650
You had to work for a living to come 
back here.

2610
01:51:17,770 --> 01:51:22,770
You'd be so happy to go back to wildlife
was just pay 28 percent tax and you 

2611
01:51:22,770 --> 01:51:22,770
know.
No,

2612
01:51:22,770 --> 01:51:25,450
I remember when I was in high school and
how he's on vacation in myrtle beach,

2613
01:51:25,451 --> 01:51:28,000
which is the widest trashes the case in 
ever,

2614
01:51:28,300 --> 01:51:33,300
but I remember talking to this guy and 
all he did every day was open up this 

2615
01:51:33,300 --> 01:51:36,490
little shack that looked like a grass 
cut and make margarita is for people and

2616
01:51:36,491 --> 01:51:38,270
he just sat there every day that we were
talking.

2617
01:51:38,340 --> 01:51:40,030
I was talking to them like,
you did this every day.

2618
01:51:40,120 --> 01:51:40,790
He goes,
fuck you.

2619
01:51:40,870 --> 01:51:45,870
Like I see the hottest chick that sit 
here on the beach and do nothing but 

2620
01:51:45,870 --> 01:51:45,870
make drinks.
Man.

2621
01:51:45,870 --> 01:51:46,510
It's the greatest life ever.
I'm like,

2622
01:51:46,750 --> 01:51:48,310
I love this guy.
I was like,

2623
01:51:48,340 --> 01:51:50,260
that he makes just enough because you'd 
probably.

2624
01:51:50,261 --> 01:51:53,910
I mean probably could never make enough 
to buy like something huge or anything,

2625
01:51:54,010 --> 01:51:58,120
but it gets bought by a private relies 
on credit and stuff like that as a life.

2626
01:51:58,120 --> 01:51:58,720
To me,
I was like,

2627
01:51:58,750 --> 01:52:00,550
oh,
you just pretty much do what you like to

2628
01:52:00,551 --> 01:52:01,710
do.
I don't know.

2629
01:52:01,840 --> 01:52:03,370
Yeah,
there's an argument for that man.

2630
01:52:03,371 --> 01:52:05,440
There's definitely an argument for the 
dude that checks out.

2631
01:52:05,510 --> 01:52:07,810
I'm just like an expatriate moves to 
Costa Rica,

2632
01:52:08,170 --> 01:52:13,170
sits on the fucking beach and drinks 
margarita is why the world explodes in 

2633
01:52:13,170 --> 01:52:13,170
the distance.
Yeah,

2634
01:52:13,170 --> 01:52:15,640
I mean there's an argument for that.
My dad's about to retire.

2635
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:19,840
He's 60 something just about to retire 
this year and I'm like,

2636
01:52:19,900 --> 01:52:24,900
I'm like,
aren't you scared that you know you're 

2637
01:52:24,900 --> 01:52:24,900
not going to have any income coming in 
at all and you guys,

2638
01:52:24,900 --> 01:52:27,010
it's kind of scary but you're not saved 
up so much.

2639
01:52:27,011 --> 01:52:27,430
And I'm like,
yeah,

2640
01:52:27,431 --> 01:52:32,431
but you could have one hospital thing,
fuck your life up and then now you have 

2641
01:52:32,431 --> 01:52:36,391
to go back to work like 20 years later 
and you're gonna be out of the loop 

2642
01:52:36,391 --> 01:52:39,661
working at fucking grocery stores,
trying to pay for your wife to buy new 

2643
01:52:39,661 --> 01:52:39,760
diapers for it,
you know?

2644
01:52:39,870 --> 01:52:43,720
And that freaks me the fuck out.
How much does your dad I've saved up,

2645
01:52:43,750 --> 01:52:45,380
I mean,
how many years worth money?

2646
01:52:45,410 --> 01:52:48,560
I'm not really sure,
but it's probably over a million.

2647
01:52:48,561 --> 01:52:50,450
I would imagine.
It's got over a million dollars car.

2648
01:52:50,500 --> 01:52:51,190
Yeah.
Yeah,

2649
01:52:51,230 --> 01:52:53,490
I think that's what you see.
I don't under.

2650
01:52:53,660 --> 01:52:54,920
I will ensure.
Yeah,

2651
01:52:54,980 --> 01:52:58,300
yeah.
I noticed but I don't take smart.

2652
01:52:58,390 --> 01:52:59,120
Yeah.
But still,

2653
01:52:59,121 --> 01:53:04,121
but nowadays a million dollars.
I mean you go to the doctor and you get 

2654
01:53:04,121 --> 01:53:05,990
fucking chemo,
you're paying like $200,000,

2655
01:53:05,991 --> 01:53:06,900
you know,
or something like that.

2656
01:53:07,460 --> 01:53:09,740
Definitely make sure you keep up on your
health insurance.

2657
01:53:10,830 --> 01:53:15,830
Scary them hit or scared he could 
because he could live another 50 years 

2658
01:53:15,830 --> 01:53:17,310
old.
Sixty two or something like that.

2659
01:53:17,480 --> 01:53:18,860
Because your dad going to lift up two 
years.

2660
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:19,700
Well,
I mean,

2661
01:53:20,140 --> 01:53:21,220
you know what I'm saying?

2662
01:53:24,850 --> 01:53:28,520
no,
but he could live 40 years.

2663
01:53:28,521 --> 01:53:30,980
What does he want to do?
Like when he retired as you have a thing

2664
01:53:30,981 --> 01:53:32,160
that he wants,
he likes,

2665
01:53:32,250 --> 01:53:37,250
he's just like me but with the,
they didn't have computers so he does 

2666
01:53:37,250 --> 01:53:37,970
everything else but like electronics and
building things.

2667
01:53:38,070 --> 01:53:41,420
So he will make like a hot tub and his 
living room,

2668
01:53:41,510 --> 01:53:43,120
you know,
that build his own.

2669
01:53:43,130 --> 01:53:48,130
Yeah.
He'll feel like the whole living room 

2670
01:53:48,130 --> 01:53:48,130
and hot tub just refine,
you know?

2671
01:53:48,130 --> 01:53:48,130
Wow.
That's cool.

2672
01:53:48,800 --> 01:53:51,080
Things like that that keep.
TheY keep people happy man.

2673
01:53:51,081 --> 01:53:56,081
Hobbies and things do.
Maybe he can invent something and sell 

2674
01:53:56,081 --> 01:53:56,081
it.
Maybe he should concentrate on trying to

2675
01:53:56,081 --> 01:54:00,491
do that while he's been trying to break.
Was a perpetual motion for the longest 

2676
01:54:00,491 --> 01:54:03,641
time.
So he has all these perpetual motion 

2677
01:54:03,641 --> 01:54:04,280
machines in his basement and you'd go in
there and just magnets with bike bikes,

2678
01:54:04,310 --> 01:54:05,960
sickle tires and like.

2679
01:54:06,310 --> 01:54:09,010
And he's got like 15 patents.
he builds things all the time.

2680
01:54:09,011 --> 01:54:14,011
Let's say that it's like he builds a 
computer that gets right on out of your 

2681
01:54:14,011 --> 01:54:14,450
bathroom,
you know,

2682
01:54:14,451 --> 01:54:15,200
and then you're like,
what?

2683
01:54:15,230 --> 01:54:17,030
What's radon gas?
Well,

2684
01:54:17,031 --> 01:54:20,070
why doesn't he just a co.
I mean that seems like a,

2685
01:54:20,170 --> 01:54:22,100
like a really promising avenue to pursue
it.

2686
01:54:22,120 --> 01:54:24,830
Is that creative?
Maybe he should just think about that.

2687
01:54:24,860 --> 01:54:28,580
Think about retiring and using all this 
time to try to come up with some new way

2688
01:54:28,581 --> 01:54:29,640
to make income.
Right.

2689
01:54:29,660 --> 01:54:31,940
That's what I told him.
He needs to like make something.

2690
01:54:32,420 --> 01:54:33,230
Why not?
fuck it,

2691
01:54:33,231 --> 01:54:34,260
man.
Little dude,

2692
01:54:34,261 --> 01:54:39,261
you know better to take that chance at 
60 then 60 days that we're sending was 

2693
01:54:39,261 --> 01:54:41,030
better to take that chance at 60.
Then they'll take their chance.

2694
01:54:41,040 --> 01:54:42,530
When you're fucking,
you're almost dead.

2695
01:54:42,531 --> 01:54:43,130
And they're like,
god,

2696
01:54:43,131 --> 01:54:44,540
I should have done something 
interesting.

2697
01:54:44,770 --> 01:54:45,380
You know,
what if he,

2698
01:54:45,500 --> 01:54:48,140
what if he makes it and one falls 
suddenly starts making a good living off

2699
01:54:48,141 --> 01:54:53,141
of something he created and get up at 
noon and fucking go to the coffee shop 

2700
01:54:53,661 --> 01:54:54,760
and,
you know,

2701
01:54:54,950 --> 01:54:55,880
check this out,
check this out.

2702
01:54:55,900 --> 01:54:58,220
How crazy.
Sometimes things happen in life,

2703
01:54:58,221 --> 01:54:58,910
you know,
uh,

2704
01:54:59,010 --> 01:55:02,300
they were supposed to come out and visit
me next month and he was going to retire

2705
01:55:02,301 --> 01:55:07,301
the following month.
And my stepmom was thinking about 

2706
01:55:07,301 --> 01:55:07,301
retiring the following month.
And then,

2707
01:55:07,301 --> 01:55:09,350
uh,
I broke up with my relationships.

2708
01:55:09,380 --> 01:55:14,380
So they decided not to come the 
following day after deciding not to 

2709
01:55:14,380 --> 01:55:15,540
come,
they're getting late.

2710
01:55:15,541 --> 01:55:20,541
My step mom's getting laid off.
But because she had like over a week of 

2711
01:55:20,541 --> 01:55:23,630
vacation time set aside that she'd never
used.

2712
01:55:23,660 --> 01:55:28,660
They have to like force some kind of 
like year pension plan or whatever the 

2713
01:55:28,660 --> 01:55:31,280
bottom line is just because she didn't,
they didn't take that vacation.

2714
01:55:31,340 --> 01:55:34,520
She gets paid for a year for no reason.
An extra year.

2715
01:55:34,550 --> 01:55:36,620
So she would have visited me and bought 
that ticket.

2716
01:55:36,790 --> 01:55:41,790
She would have been screwed by the 
corporate world because I love when the 

2717
01:55:41,790 --> 01:55:45,860
house.
Do you believe in fate and stuff like 

2718
01:55:45,860 --> 01:55:45,860
that and like things that happened for a
reason.

2719
01:55:45,860 --> 01:55:49,911
Do you believe that you think 
everything's kind of set out and you 

2720
01:55:49,911 --> 01:55:50,240
really can't change it?
It's easy to be cynical.

2721
01:55:50,260 --> 01:55:53,200
I love that idea.
But it also seems sometimes like,

2722
01:55:53,201 --> 01:55:55,570
it almost seems like life is scripted,
you know,

2723
01:55:55,571 --> 01:55:58,660
and in your situation,
I think it seems like at some time in my

2724
01:55:58,661 --> 01:56:03,661
situation in my life,
it's sometimes it seems so ridiculous 

2725
01:56:03,661 --> 01:56:05,770
that it almost seems like we are living 
our own movie,

2726
01:56:06,100 --> 01:56:06,600
you know,
the,

2727
01:56:06,610 --> 01:56:07,930
the,
you know that.

2728
01:56:07,931 --> 01:56:12,020
And the more gonzo the fucking news gets
and the more bizarro,

2729
01:56:12,220 --> 01:56:13,080
you know,
uh,

2730
01:56:13,100 --> 01:56:14,350
our,
our culture gets,

2731
01:56:14,351 --> 01:56:15,640
the more,
it seems like a movie,

2732
01:56:15,641 --> 01:56:18,340
the more it seems like,
it almost seems fake.

2733
01:56:18,610 --> 01:56:20,470
It almost seems like we're living in a 
dream,

2734
01:56:20,740 --> 01:56:25,740
you know?
And if you look at some of the things 

2735
01:56:25,740 --> 01:56:25,970
that happen to certain people,
you,

2736
01:56:25,971 --> 01:56:26,650
you,
you go,

2737
01:56:26,651 --> 01:56:27,800
well,
what's it attributable?

2738
01:56:27,950 --> 01:56:29,800
Trivial is it,
is it,

2739
01:56:29,830 --> 01:56:34,830
can you attribute it to the fact that 
they've lived positive life and so good 

2740
01:56:34,830 --> 01:56:36,640
things are happening to them and is it 
karma?

2741
01:56:36,790 --> 01:56:41,290
So it's karma real because that's like 
one of the trippiest spiciest of notions

2742
01:56:41,291 --> 01:56:43,540
ever.
So is that what's really going on?

2743
01:56:43,840 --> 01:56:47,340
Or is it because there's a grand plot to
life?

2744
01:56:47,610 --> 01:56:51,130
Is it because life is like a gigantic 
mathematical equation and there's like a

2745
01:56:51,131 --> 01:56:56,131
set,
there's a set result it's going to 

2746
01:56:56,131 --> 01:56:58,381
happen no matter what.
That's all working towards that set 

2747
01:56:58,381 --> 01:56:59,560
result and you getting a certain job and
you meeting a certain person is all part

2748
01:56:59,561 --> 01:57:02,470
of the grand plan of the universe.
That's fucking weird.

2749
01:57:02,530 --> 01:57:03,410
It is weird.
It's,

2750
01:57:03,570 --> 01:57:06,070
it's,
it's you can't say one or the other.

2751
01:57:06,220 --> 01:57:09,850
You can't say yes.
I believe in fate and fate is real mean.

2752
01:57:09,851 --> 01:57:12,580
You should consider it,
but you also can't say fate's not real.

2753
01:57:12,581 --> 01:57:17,581
And you know you decide your own destiny
because I don't know if that's true 

2754
01:57:17,581 --> 01:57:17,581
either.
You know,

2755
01:57:17,581 --> 01:57:20,200
I mean we are a weird combination of 
biology,

2756
01:57:20,230 --> 01:57:23,620
of life,
experiences of genetics.

2757
01:57:23,621 --> 01:57:24,180
You know,
there's,

2758
01:57:24,181 --> 01:57:25,860
there's a lot of shit going on,
you know,

2759
01:57:25,950 --> 01:57:29,200
how you interpret the life experience,
the people you come in contact with that

2760
01:57:29,201 --> 01:57:31,030
help you rethink the way you look at 
things.

2761
01:57:31,170 --> 01:57:36,170
I mean,
how many people have you ever met that 

2762
01:57:36,170 --> 01:57:36,170
inspire you and literally change the way
you think about those?

2763
01:57:37,170 --> 01:57:42,170
It makes me wonder if I was supposed to 
meet and go through this experience and 

2764
01:57:42,170 --> 01:57:46,130
a lot of times I just want to like,
I felt like that last sound is going on 

2765
01:57:46,130 --> 01:57:46,420
in the back of it,
you know,

2766
01:57:46,800 --> 01:57:49,050
because it just seems like it's just 
like that.

2767
01:57:49,051 --> 01:57:49,980
Like it's just

2768
01:57:50,410 --> 01:57:51,830
a weird,
like quick,

2769
01:57:51,870 --> 01:57:56,870
like some shit just seems fake.
I think a lot of it is because you live 

2770
01:57:56,870 --> 01:57:57,610
in your life the right way or you think 
you'll a lot of is you live in real life

2771
01:57:57,611 --> 01:57:59,780
positive.
You're not being shitty to anybody.

2772
01:58:00,160 --> 01:58:01,440
Well,
karma is a real thing.

2773
01:58:01,441 --> 01:58:06,441
Definitely.
I believe karma is or that's why this 

2774
01:58:06,441 --> 01:58:06,441
fuck that's ratting out larry king's 
wife.

2775
01:58:06,441 --> 01:58:08,490
He's going to get it.
Shit's gonna hit the fan for you son.

2776
01:58:08,510 --> 01:58:09,880
You know he's gonna have nipple camp 
certainty.

2777
01:58:10,990 --> 01:58:12,820
It's going to get ugly.
I don't know.

2778
01:58:12,821 --> 01:58:15,350
I don't know if it's true and I think,
you know,

2779
01:58:15,370 --> 01:58:18,610
it's one of those subjects where people 
are very polarized on it,

2780
01:58:18,880 --> 01:58:20,230
you know,
some people,

2781
01:58:20,231 --> 01:58:25,231
uh,
will people will argue vehemently that 

2782
01:58:25,231 --> 01:58:25,840
their size correct because it's sort of 
like,

2783
01:58:25,930 --> 01:58:28,420
like a windows versus mac argument,
you know,

2784
01:58:28,421 --> 01:58:30,700
it's like a religion versus atheism 
argument.

2785
01:58:30,730 --> 01:58:31,870
It's like,
you know,

2786
01:58:31,871 --> 01:58:35,110
people want to be correct.
They have choose a stance,

2787
01:58:35,140 --> 01:58:37,480
they choose a camp that they're in,
you know,

2788
01:58:37,481 --> 01:58:39,820
and that's fate is one of the weird 
ones.

2789
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:41,770
I'm open to the idea.
There's a fate.

2790
01:58:41,830 --> 01:58:46,830
I'm open to the idea that there's,
that life really is like some sort of a 

2791
01:58:46,830 --> 01:58:49,750
gigantic equation and that it's moving 
towards something I don't know.

2792
01:58:49,990 --> 01:58:54,990
I trY to,
I try to keep an open mind about all of 

2793
01:58:54,990 --> 01:58:57,050
that stuff because I think as soon as 
you decide that you have the 

2794
01:58:57,050 --> 01:58:57,050
information,
one way or another,

2795
01:58:57,050 --> 01:58:57,370
you're being silly.

2796
01:58:57,390 --> 01:59:02,390
Yeah.
Because Then you're going to block off 

2797
01:59:02,390 --> 01:59:02,390
with and only hear what you want to hear
and then you're,

2798
01:59:02,390 --> 01:59:02,930
you're living the right,

2799
01:59:03,060 --> 01:59:04,050
right.
I mean,

2800
01:59:04,051 --> 01:59:09,051
we have friends that believe in nutty 
things and we've had conversations with 

2801
01:59:09,051 --> 01:59:12,951
these friends that believe in nutty 
things and you can tell they are not 

2802
01:59:12,951 --> 01:59:14,940
even considering the fact that these 
nutty things they believe in are in fact

2803
01:59:14,941 --> 01:59:16,600
just nutty things,
you know?

2804
01:59:16,620 --> 01:59:17,550
I mean,
that's,

2805
01:59:17,880 --> 01:59:19,100
that's a disconnect.
There's,

2806
01:59:19,340 --> 01:59:24,340
you know,
and you said it best when you said 

2807
01:59:24,340 --> 01:59:24,390
you're not keeping everything on the 
table.

2808
01:59:24,690 --> 01:59:26,610
That's rule number one.
Rule number one,

2809
01:59:26,611 --> 01:59:27,060
you have to keep up

2810
01:59:27,430 --> 01:59:30,000
even when you have 100 percent 
everything on the table,

2811
01:59:30,001 --> 01:59:33,880
like a positive on the table.
Why even bother taking the table away?

2812
01:59:33,881 --> 01:59:35,100
You know,
if something comes up,

2813
01:59:35,320 --> 01:59:36,060
it'd be no reason that.
Okay.

2814
01:59:36,100 --> 01:59:39,010
Exactly.
We get married to a,

2815
01:59:39,011 --> 01:59:42,170
an answer a yes or a no.
A side of.

2816
01:59:42,230 --> 01:59:43,950
For or against,
you know,

2817
01:59:43,960 --> 01:59:46,000
I mean it's like religion.
It's like anything else.

2818
01:59:46,030 --> 01:59:49,210
Human beings are very insecure and you 
know,

2819
01:59:49,211 --> 01:59:53,500
our life inherently is insecure and 
because of that I think we try to,

2820
01:59:53,950 --> 01:59:58,950
we try to put things in a box so that we
can deal with them when they're in a 

2821
01:59:58,950 --> 01:59:58,950
box.
There it is.

2822
01:59:58,950 --> 02:00:00,730
We've got labeled.
It's wrapped up.

2823
02:00:00,760 --> 02:00:01,510
Okay.
Okay.

2824
02:00:01,540 --> 02:00:03,220
God is not real.
It's in that box.

2825
02:00:03,430 --> 02:00:04,720
Let's move on.
Okay.

2826
02:00:04,780 --> 02:00:07,060
do we like windows and mac?
I say windows.

2827
02:00:07,061 --> 02:00:09,610
Mac os for faggots.
Put it in the box.

2828
02:00:09,611 --> 02:00:12,310
We're move on.
Whereas for pc,

2829
02:00:12,430 --> 02:00:15,300
getting to this is just for idiots.
Idiots that,

2830
02:00:15,910 --> 02:00:16,840
you know.
I don't know.

2831
02:00:17,260 --> 02:00:18,100
I think,
uh,

2832
02:00:18,300 --> 02:00:20,080
I don't know.
I think we hit two hours.

2833
02:00:20,590 --> 02:00:25,590
I think this is good.
We're going to end on a positive note 

2834
02:00:25,590 --> 02:00:25,590
list.
Gentleman.

2835
02:00:25,590 --> 02:00:25,770
Um,

2836
02:00:26,420 --> 02:00:29,930
so thank you very much for tuning in.
When you come back next week,

2837
02:00:29,931 --> 02:00:33,110
we will have a couch.
We will have better cameras.

2838
02:00:33,111 --> 02:00:36,130
We have a new video cameras coming in.
Uh,

2839
02:00:36,170 --> 02:00:39,740
the audio that's on this week's itunes 
will be,

2840
02:00:39,741 --> 02:00:44,741
as we said,
from a big beefed up mp three recorder 

2841
02:00:44,741 --> 02:00:45,800
and it's supposed to be the best one 
that you could buy.

2842
02:00:45,980 --> 02:00:49,910
So hopefully that will be the case.
So it will be clean audio on the itunes.

2843
02:00:49,911 --> 02:00:53,600
We have two audios to audio versions of 
it and uh,

2844
02:00:53,601 --> 02:00:56,960
we will continue to evolve it.
