6
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:27,000
As is in the house gritches Buckler 
Rogan experience.

7
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:28,830
We're fitting to make shit happen.

8
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:42,680
I'm going to say that all the time.
Now we're fend to do this friend to make

9
00:00:42,681 --> 00:00:46,160
shit happen.
Don't even know where that came from.

10
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:49,460
I don't know why it exists with Finn 
will fend to do this,

11
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:52,530
but I like it.
I'm a fan of were fin to.

12
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:55,800
We're going to do this.
I don't know what it means.

13
00:00:57,330 --> 00:01:00,500
You lost me on that.
We fend to go do this podcast.

14
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:06,190
Some guy tweeted me saying he doesn't 
like when I do a black force and to him 

15
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,300
I say tough shit.
You're gonna.

16
00:01:08,301 --> 00:01:13,301
Have to deal with that.
If there wasn't people that actually 

17
00:01:13,301 --> 00:01:13,301
talk like that,
you know,

18
00:01:13,301 --> 00:01:15,290
if I was doing that white guy voice that
Richard Pryor always did,

19
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:18,290
that never bothered me.
It was like either Mr.

20
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,810
so Mr Pryor,
my,

21
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:23,510
my mom,
why she's a great old Gal.

22
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,940
I guess there are a few people that talk
like that,

23
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:30,680
but there's a lot of motherfuckers who 
talked like my black voice.

24
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:35,710
Okay.
It's not like you have to go find them 

25
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:36,230
like,
Gee Golly Gee Whiz,

26
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:37,190
Gee Whiz,
Gee whiz or maker.

27
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,130
No,
there's a lot of dudes will be like,

28
00:01:40,131 --> 00:01:43,040
we Finna do this podcast.
That's not even ridiculous.

29
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,650
That sounds exactly what a lot of black 
people sound like,

30
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,200
but for whatever fucking reason,
man,

31
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:52,010
black,
feeble are so super sensitive about just

32
00:01:52,011 --> 00:01:55,030
a little good natured joking around.

33
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:55,980
I,
I got it.

34
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:58,530
I got in trouble the other day.
I went to our fi,

35
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:00,430
like a five star restaurant called the 
Ritz.

36
00:02:00,431 --> 00:02:02,210
I don't know if you ever heard it,
but it was like,

37
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,290
like the most widest place ever.
Like there was four waiters,

38
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:10,291
one for just your glasses and they were 
all standing by your tables for my 

39
00:02:10,291 --> 00:02:10,660
birthday.
And I twittered a joke.

40
00:02:10,661 --> 00:02:11,150
Like,
Oh,

41
00:02:11,151 --> 00:02:12,910
I really wish they would let black 
people in here.

42
00:02:12,911 --> 00:02:14,680
Ha ha ha.
You know as a joke.

43
00:02:14,681 --> 00:02:18,220
And people got so fucking pissed off at 
me and I had to explain like,

44
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:19,540
no,
I was making fun of that.

45
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:21,310
I was making fun how,
how wide,

46
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,830
how wide it was and how it was 
disgusting.

47
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:26,920
Yeah.
People are Super God damn sensitive.

48
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:32,040
I made one fucking joke and I think the 
joke was because there was something 

49
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:36,841
real obvious in the news.
I forget what it was and my response to 

50
00:02:36,851 --> 00:02:41,851
it was a.
So they're telling us some shit that we 

51
00:02:41,851 --> 00:02:41,851
already knew.
Like what?

52
00:02:41,851 --> 00:02:45,761
What's next?
You're going to tell me that many black 

53
00:02:45,761 --> 00:02:45,761
people don't tip.
You know?

54
00:02:45,761 --> 00:02:47,320
Which by the way,
I'm not saying all but I'm saying many.

55
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:52,350
I'm saying it's,
it's a known thing that if you work in 

56
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:52,350
restaurants,
a lot of times black people don't tip.

57
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:53,530
If you're black and you tip,
God bless Ya.

58
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:58,560
You know,
I'm not saying there's anything wrong 

59
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:58,560
with that,
but I am from Italian descent.

60
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,540
I'm Italian,
Irish and I have said on many occasions 

61
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:07,000
that my people are fucking monkeys.
Those fucking dummies,

62
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:11,710
those wanna be soprano dummies.
There's so many dumb Italian.

63
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:14,350
It is embarrassing to be Italian all the
time.

64
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:18,490
Italians make some bad ass food and 
there's a certain Robert Deniro,

65
00:03:18,491 --> 00:03:20,890
percentage of Italians that are bad 
motherfuckers.

66
00:03:20,891 --> 00:03:22,990
There's a few rocky Marciano's out there
in the world,

67
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:28,170
but by and large the great percentage of
Italians are douchebags and that's me.

68
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:30,640
That's me.
We're just being realistic.

69
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:36,100
Nothing wrong with that,
but for whatever fucking reason I say 

70
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:39,271
this thing about black people tipping 
and people are calling me races and all 

71
00:03:39,271 --> 00:03:43,150
this fucking shit.
So this weekend I'm in Philadelphia,

72
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:48,390
right?
We're there for the UFC and I'm with my 

73
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:50,731
boy Tommy Jr and his girl Katie,
and we get high as Jesus on the fucking 

74
00:03:51,761 --> 00:03:55,270
space shuttle we got.
We got down Joe Diaz.

75
00:03:55,271 --> 00:03:57,430
We went deep.
We just kept smoking.

76
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:01,720
Got To break up the we'd when I come up 
here though.

77
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:04,750
What are you talking about that we don't
do shit to me?

78
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:07,660
If you make me drive 40 minutes up and 
you've got to get me stolen,

79
00:04:07,661 --> 00:04:09,140
bro.
That's will handle.

80
00:04:09,141 --> 00:04:10,270
We'd.
I've been telling you about that.

81
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,010
She's crying.
Yeah.

82
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:12,880
You broke that shit to the ice house to 
that shit.

83
00:04:12,881 --> 00:04:14,950
Don't do nothing to you.
Just so crazy.

84
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:18,950
What the fuck,
doctor,

85
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:24,760
you got to bust out some good weed.
Dug enough is enough with this show.

86
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:30,600
You can not look at my fucking eyes,
but I look high to you.

87
00:04:30,601 --> 00:04:34,830

00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:43,910

00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:54,510
So relax.

94
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,670
Love you.

95
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,880

That's the biggest thing was that it was

102
00:05:20,551 --> 00:05:25,551
a tightly rolled joint power hits where 
he's just feeling in his lungs,

00:05:25,981 --> 00:05:27,360
you are,
you're you like big.

104
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:30,090
I couldn't get a hit off of it was too 
fucking tight.

105
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:37,690
Fucking screaming at America,
listening to you saying that you're high

106
00:05:39,151 --> 00:05:42,090
and you give me that stuff.
You know I love you to death,

107
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:44,520

Love people who are listening to this.

109
00:05:46,531 --> 00:05:47,970
You understand that?
This is entertainment.

110
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:50,670
I know all you're doing is complaining 
about not complaining.

111
00:05:50,671 --> 00:05:53,400
I'm just saying that I want to get high 
when I'm not complaining.

112
00:05:53,401 --> 00:05:55,140
Listening to what you're doing that's 
complaining.

113
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:56,640
You invite me to your home and you give 
me.

114
00:05:56,641 --> 00:06:00,740
This sucks Hannah.
We have Hannah.

115
00:06:00,741 --> 00:06:02,620
What else?
What the fuck are you talking about?

116
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,270
No Avenue.
Costello was cheap.

117
00:06:05,271 --> 00:06:10,271
Fucking hat.

That shit.
Shut the fuck up.

120
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:15,770
I'm talking about the Goddamn thing I 
did this weekend.

121
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:17,890
I didn't know about that shit.
Weed.

122
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:20,330
You just.
You are so fucked up.

123
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,160
Fuck.
Look at my eyes.

124
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:23,450
Yeah,
that's what it is.

125
00:06:23,451 --> 00:06:26,690
It's not that you weigh 300 pounds and 
he smoked pot all day everyday.

126
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:28,850
That's what.
That's not what it is.

127
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,810
Fucking fucking do it.
Blame.

128
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:37,470
It's not fat.
It's the physical size of your body or 

129
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:39,950
you're crazy.
I go to other stores.

130
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:43,160
I go to other stores the fuck.
That's the second time.

131
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,850
So fucking whining.
Complaining,

132
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:48,930
whining,
complaining.

133
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,470
So brody here.
So this is showing like bad.

134
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:55,940
Will you please shut the fuck up man.
This is a Goddamn podcasts.

135
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:59,330
You've been complaining for five fucking
minutes about weed telling me that.

136
00:06:59,331 --> 00:07:00,160
What such what?
Hannah.

137
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:03,300
You know what?
I don't know what [inaudible] is.

138
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:06,140
No more fucking late night podcasts for 
Joe.

139
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:08,090
No more.
No more.

140
00:07:08,091 --> 00:07:10,670
You can't handle a dog.
I love you too.

141
00:07:10,671 --> 00:07:13,280
But there's 2000 people listening right 
now.

142
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:18,880
Hundreds of thousands of listening 
online and all you're doing is 

143
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,330
complaining about weed for five minutes.
Fucking podcast that.

144
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,790
Yeah,
that might have been ruined.

145
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:21,880
I,
uh,

146
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:25,190
I've been a big fan of her youtube.
Shut the fuck up about this thing.

147
00:07:25,191 --> 00:07:28,250
I've got to tell you about Philadelphia.
Fuck God dammit.

148
00:07:28,251 --> 00:07:30,530
You try and change the subject after he 
beats me down.

149
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,840
I was just trying to calm them down for 
a second.

150
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,520
Don't talk about.
We dogged out around me dog.

151
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:41,390
I got,
I got to Philly.

152
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:42,520
Is that

153
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:44,060
cracked bell?
Yeah,

154
00:07:44,061 --> 00:07:45,700
we're in Philadelphia.
We,

155
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:48,230
Tommy junior brings us Connecticut.
We'd,

156
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,360
I am thinking this is going to be just 
terrible.

157
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:51,800
I don't think there's going to be 
useless,

158
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,980
but it was,
it was Joey Diaz style.

159
00:07:55,100 --> 00:08:00,100
Gee,
Kush Endeca the shit that you used to 

160
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:00,100
smoke and we just go eight,
nine,

161
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:02,600
10 hits deep to the point where we don't
want to leave the balcony.

162
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:03,920
Okay.
We're terrified.

163
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:07,070
We're out there and we're looking at and
it's a beautiful summer night and um,

164
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:08,600
you know,
Tommy Jr is my boy.

165
00:08:08,601 --> 00:08:10,670
I've known him since I was like in my 
early twenties.

166
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:15,880
And you know,
his girl Katie is really cool and we're 

167
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,831
hanging out in.
The three of us are just giggling or as 

168
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:17,831
I've gone,
we're too high to go outside.

169
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:19,310
We're so high.
We so nervous and paranoid,

170
00:08:19,311 --> 00:08:21,110
but we're going to see planet of the 
apes.

171
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:23,930
We had decided that the evening was.

172
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:28,930
I was looking forward to this weekend 
very much because usually on Friday 

173
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:28,930
night before the UFC,
I always do a show.

174
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:33,731
We always do a show somewhere,
but this weekend I was just going to 

175
00:08:33,731 --> 00:08:33,990
play pool with Tommy and Tommy,
uh,

176
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:35,690
texted me somewhere during the week.
Dude,

177
00:08:35,691 --> 00:08:37,610
planet of the apes opens this week.
Let's do that too.

178
00:08:37,611 --> 00:08:38,420
Like,
fuck yeah,

179
00:08:38,421 --> 00:08:39,470
we gotta you know,
for me,

180
00:08:39,471 --> 00:08:40,490
man,
I've got kids,

181
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:45,580
little babies and they constantly need 
supervision and I don't really get a 

182
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:46,550
chance to just go fuck off for a whole 
day.

183
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:47,720
So this is,
I do the,

184
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:48,610
the,
the uh,

185
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:53,670
Wayne's are done by 5:00
and I'm hanging out with Tommy right 

186
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:57,251
after that.
I do some UFC shit for like an hour and 

187
00:08:57,251 --> 00:08:57,960
then we're hanging out.
So were so high we can't,

188
00:08:58,050 --> 00:08:59,850
we can't think straight.
We're just giggling,

189
00:08:59,851 --> 00:09:01,590
but little giggle,
silly high.

190
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:05,160
It wasn't like my kind of high where 
it's like thinking about Jupiter and you

191
00:09:05,161 --> 00:09:10,161
know,
what happens if a planet hits another 

192
00:09:10,161 --> 00:09:10,161
planet?

193
00:09:10,161 --> 00:09:10,161
No,
it's the,

194
00:09:10,161 --> 00:09:12,780
it's Joe Diaz style high.
So we're giggling and we have a driver.

195
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:14,820
Luckily I have this God taking us 
around,

196
00:09:14,821 --> 00:09:16,500
you know,
like a big town car.

197
00:09:16,501 --> 00:09:16,980
But uh,
you know,

198
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:22,010
whatever those suv things.
So the guy takes us to this movie 

199
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:26,031
theater,
I go take us to whatever the good movie 

200
00:09:26,031 --> 00:09:26,031
theaters in town,
right?

201
00:09:26,031 --> 00:09:26,031
And he goes,
well,

202
00:09:26,031 --> 00:09:30,591
the good movie theater is over here.
And so it takes me to a super white 

203
00:09:30,591 --> 00:09:31,890
neighborhood where all the movies are.
Shit movies.

204
00:09:31,891 --> 00:09:34,230
It's all like foreign films,
you know,

205
00:09:34,231 --> 00:09:35,760
those weird,
those.

206
00:09:35,761 --> 00:09:40,380
What are those theaters call?
Will you go there and you go,

207
00:09:40,381 --> 00:09:44,670
what the fuck is this movement to look 
for something that you recognize?

208
00:09:44,671 --> 00:09:47,370
But everything's alternative.
I'm sure some of them are good,

209
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:52,550
but I,
I've seen some that everybody told me 

210
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:52,550
were good because they were alternative 
like,

211
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:56,750
like fucking was ghost dog,
whatever that Samurai one was with 

212
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:57,020
forest whitaker episode a good.

213
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,940
So amazing.
It was such a piece of shit.

214
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:02,220
It was such a dumb movie.
And everybody's like,

215
00:10:02,221 --> 00:10:05,010
it's amazing because it's because it's 
an independent film.

216
00:10:05,011 --> 00:10:06,930
So it's one of these Lemley films.
So anyway,

217
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:08,660
we uh,
we can't go there.

218
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:13,670
So I go,
you got to go to one where there's 

219
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:13,670
planet of the Apes,
man,

220
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:13,710
we're going to go see planet of the 
apes.

221
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:16,140
So I look on the iphone APP and it says,
okay,

222
00:10:16,141 --> 00:10:17,880
take me to this one.
And the guy goes,

223
00:10:17,881 --> 00:10:19,230
okay,
he goes out in a good neighborhood.

224
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,010
It's like,
oh yeah,

225
00:10:20,011 --> 00:10:20,310
yeah,
yeah,

226
00:10:20,311 --> 00:10:21,690
yeah.
Got Barely speaks English.

227
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:24,630
He texts us there,
we get out and we're giggling.

228
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:27,930
Is he putting the names?
We walk into planet of the Apes.

229
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,020
We walked into Africa,
did we?

230
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:34,740
We walked in the door and there was no 
white people.

231
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:39,800
There was no white people.
We plan the act didn't take place in 

232
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:39,800
Africa.

233
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,920
I was a racist thing to say,
but you see what I'm saying?

234
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:43,490
What I'm saying is fine automatically 
stuck to your hands.

235
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:47,940
What would happen is we walked into the 
blackest neighborhood we could find.

236
00:10:47,941 --> 00:10:48,510
I mean,
it was,

237
00:10:48,511 --> 00:10:53,511
there was literally no white people.
It was amazing and everybody was super 

238
00:10:53,671 --> 00:10:54,240
cool,
you know,

239
00:10:54,241 --> 00:10:59,241
it wasn't a negative experience.
And this was something that I wrote on 

240
00:10:59,241 --> 00:10:59,241
on twitter that,
uh,

241
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:02,400
we all went to see a planet of the apes 
in a black neighborhood and experience.

242
00:11:02,401 --> 00:11:06,630
I highly recommend all these fucking 
people started calling me a racist.

243
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:09,300
I mean,
dozens of twitter.

244
00:11:09,301 --> 00:11:10,950
People do what?
I didn't know you were racist.

245
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,870
Fuck you.
Like black people were saying,

246
00:11:12,871 --> 00:11:13,560
fuck you.
I'm like,

247
00:11:13,561 --> 00:11:18,561
listen man,
I am saying it was a positive 

248
00:11:18,561 --> 00:11:21,321
experience.
It would sit on highly recommended and 

249
00:11:21,321 --> 00:11:22,050
it was a black neighborhood and we get 
in there.

250
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:27,050
Right?
And we're so we're so deeply 

251
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:27,050
heartbroken.
And then I realized like,

252
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:27,050
Whoa,
everyone's black.

253
00:11:27,051 --> 00:11:27,570
You're like,
well,

254
00:11:27,571 --> 00:11:29,370
I mean everyone's black.
This is crazy.

255
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:34,520
And then a bunch of people recognize me 
and they don't want to take some 

256
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:34,520
pictures and it's all good.
Everybody's cool and friendly.

257
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,610
Coolest shit.
Cooler Shit.

258
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,260
Like this guy goes,
Yo man,

259
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,060
I don't wait.
I know you from.

260
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:40,800
I don't want to.
I don't want to bother you man.

261
00:11:40,801 --> 00:11:43,290
I'm not trying to use up your time.
I know you from.

262
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:44,460
I go,
fear factor.

263
00:11:44,461 --> 00:11:45,350
I go,
yeah,

264
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,790
that's it.
But it's the way you said it was like so

265
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:51,510
cool and we're giggling.
Oh no one did the smoke rocks thing,

266
00:11:51,511 --> 00:11:53,430
but it took a lot of God damn pictures 
and see,

267
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:55,060
like I said,
super cool,

268
00:11:55,061 --> 00:11:57,160
super friendly.
This is not a negative story.

269
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:59,110
So then we go into the movie theater,
right?

270
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:00,670
It's me,
Tommy,

271
00:12:00,671 --> 00:12:02,020
and like maybe there's another white 
person,

272
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:07,050
maybe one other white person movie 
theater filled with black people and 

273
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:07,930
they are having a good fucking time.
You know,

274
00:12:07,931 --> 00:12:12,931
people always complain that black people
talk to the movie theater and talk to 

275
00:12:12,931 --> 00:12:12,931
screen.
Yes they do.

276
00:12:12,931 --> 00:12:14,260
Yes they do,
but it's good.

277
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:16,150
That's totally fucking.
Yeah.

278
00:12:16,151 --> 00:12:19,120
If that's what you know.
And so way I felt like I'm like,

279
00:12:19,121 --> 00:12:20,620
look,
I'm in their neighborhood.

280
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:25,650
This is how they go to the movies.
Who the fuck am I to be offended by how 

281
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:26,290
they liked to go to the movies?
They,

282
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:29,170
they were at the movies and I'm not 
saying all black neighborhoods do this,

283
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,900
but this particular black neighborhood,
these people brought babies,

284
00:12:31,901 --> 00:12:36,901
bro.
I mean there's a lot of people with 

285
00:12:36,901 --> 00:12:36,901
babies.
Yeah.

286
00:12:36,901 --> 00:12:36,901
I mean it wasn't just one.
These,

287
00:12:36,901 --> 00:12:38,980
these people in front of us walked in 
and they had toddlers,

288
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:44,130
like little two year olds sitting on 
their lap to see planet of the apes at 

289
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:46,630
like 10:40
on a Friday night.

290
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:48,490
Give a fuck.
Fuck.

291
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,540
Not,
didn't give a fuck.

292
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:53,550
But I'll tell you what made me really 
nervous and made me feel kind of weird,

293
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:58,740
was watching all of these previews of 
all these different TV shows or all 

294
00:12:59,891 --> 00:13:04,891
these different movies around them that 
are coming out and I'm watching these 

295
00:13:04,891 --> 00:13:08,041
movies and all of them are about white 
people and I'm sitting there and I'm 

296
00:13:08,591 --> 00:13:09,130
going,
wow,

297
00:13:09,131 --> 00:13:12,640
this is weird.
Like w imagined being a blank person.

298
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:14,950
And I always thought like people would 
complain.

299
00:13:14,951 --> 00:13:16,810
Like I'd hear Black People Complain 
About,

300
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:19,360
oh,
there's no films for black people.

301
00:13:19,361 --> 00:13:21,970
There's no roles for black actors.
And I'd be like,

302
00:13:21,971 --> 00:13:24,100
so you go make your movie,
when do you want from me?

303
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:29,250
You know?
But when you go to a goddamn movie 

304
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:29,950
theater with all black people,
that's when you really feel it.

305
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:34,000
I'm sitting there in the audience and 
all these people are black,

306
00:13:34,001 --> 00:13:36,580
but every movie preview is white.

307
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:40,720
There's no black characters.
And then finally there's this movie with

308
00:13:40,721 --> 00:13:45,721
Jonah Hill and they show a preview for 
the movie and it's Jonah Hill and he's 

309
00:13:45,721 --> 00:13:47,800
doing all this different shit.
He's babysitting kids,

310
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:53,010
but he's supposed to be like a cool guy.
And the way they show you who's he's a 

311
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:56,071
cool guy is there's an old black guy 
working like at a door at a club like 

312
00:13:56,081 --> 00:13:58,750
the black guys there and Jonah Hill's 
talking black to them,

313
00:13:58,751 --> 00:13:59,680
you know,
it is what it is,

314
00:13:59,681 --> 00:14:00,430
brother,
it is what it is.

315
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:05,550
And I'm watching this with all these 
black people watching this white guy 

316
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:07,310
talk like a black guy and I'm in this 
fucking theater film.

317
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:09,520
And I'm like,
and I'm high as fuck.

318
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:13,870
I mean just barbecued sitting there 
soaking in this experience going,

319
00:14:13,871 --> 00:14:16,180
wow,
this is fucked up.

320
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:21,480
Like what?
No one knew why black people are angry 

321
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:21,480
and they feel disenfranchised.

322
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:26,100
Like they're completely removed from the
mainstream cultural experience in a lot 

323
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:30,511
of ways like that.
There's a tiny percentage of black 

324
00:14:30,511 --> 00:14:31,720
people that are included in movies.
So finally planet of the apes place,

325
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:35,350
everyone's white in the movie except the
bad guy.

326
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:40,120
The bad guy is a black guy.
And I thought it was so strange and I'm.

327
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:45,220
And not only that,
he's a bad guy who owns this giant 

328
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:47,130
company and he has an English accent.
It was like,

329
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:52,140
not only is a,
but it's like you couldn't have a 

330
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:53,150
brother from Philadelphia that figured 
out how to own this corporation.

331
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:57,320
It couldn't be a guy.
Even a brother that talks like a regular

332
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:59,540
businessman type dude,
you know,

333
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,270
who's like,
well,

334
00:15:00,271 --> 00:15:02,010
well we need to do is acquire this and 
you know,

335
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:04,970
once we get that and then we'll be on 
moving and then we get in the forest.

336
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:05,840
No,
no,

337
00:15:05,841 --> 00:15:07,590
no.
This guy has an English accent.

338
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:09,380
He doesn't sound like anybody,
you know,

339
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:12,080
and this is the only black guy in the 
fucking movie.

340
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:13,640
And I'm like,
wow.

341
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:16,640
And then the rest of the movie is just 
bad ass monkeys.

342
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:19,100
Just bad ass chimpanzees.
So this was a CGI.

343
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:19,780
Awesome.
Was it?

344
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,490
Oh my God is a good.
First of all,

345
00:15:22,491 --> 00:15:27,110
the movie is good shit.
Planet of the apes is a dope movie.

346
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:30,530
It's a good movie for everybody.
I think it's PG.

347
00:15:30,531 --> 00:15:32,210
13 believer or not.
Yeah,

348
00:15:32,211 --> 00:15:34,910
because the violence is all sort of 
implied like,

349
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:37,850
you know what the fuck went down,
but they don't really show it to you,

350
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:41,990
but it's not removed from violence.
It's a terrifying movie and the like,

351
00:15:41,991 --> 00:15:42,400
he,
you know,

352
00:15:42,401 --> 00:15:43,970
I don't want to say I can't,
I don't know.

353
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:48,470
One of the old ones.
Did you watch?

354
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,400
Oh,
I watched all of it.

355
00:15:49,401 --> 00:15:50,450
All five.
Watched all of them.

356
00:15:50,451 --> 00:15:52,490
And what'd you think of the first one is
still sensation.

357
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:53,000
It's.
Well,

358
00:15:53,001 --> 00:15:58,001
you know,
you have to put yourself back in the 

359
00:15:58,001 --> 00:15:58,001
time because back in the time it was a 
great movie.

360
00:15:58,001 --> 00:16:00,050
It's like a lot of movies they don't 
hold up because you,

361
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:05,150
you have to realize that culturally 
human beings have evolved in a shoot way

362
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:12,520
from 1970 to 2011.
I mean if you want any proof of that 

363
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:17,570
something is happening to our culture 
and that things are expanding and moving

364
00:16:17,571 --> 00:16:20,540
forward at an exponentially increasing 
way.

365
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:22,430
All you have to do is look at old 
movies.

366
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:25,760
Old Movies are almost unwatchable 
unwatchable.

367
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:30,170
The abd concept is unwatchable.
We don't last that long.

368
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:30,950
Well,
not only that,

369
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:35,960
it's just not good.
Like I watched altered states are 

370
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:36,870
trending ultimate states when I was in,
you know,

371
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,570
I,
I'm captain isolation tank,

372
00:16:38,571 --> 00:16:38,990
you know what I mean?

373
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:43,990
I mean,
I'm in that goddamn thing all the time 

374
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:45,611
and I got.
I learned about the isolation tank from 

375
00:16:45,611 --> 00:16:45,611
that movie.
I learned about Iowasca from that movie.

376
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:50,740
I learned a lot of Shit from that movie.
That movie was a big fucking 84 or 

377
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:52,160
something like that.
I think so.

378
00:16:52,161 --> 00:16:54,040
I'm just talking out of my ass.
I'm guessing though,

379
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:57,020
that again,
altered states.

380
00:16:57,460 --> 00:17:00,170
It's not the Christopher Walken away 
takes no William hurt,

381
00:17:00,171 --> 00:17:05,171
right?
It was in 1980 or even earlier than we 

382
00:17:05,171 --> 00:17:05,171
thought.
Thirty one years ago.

383
00:17:05,171 --> 00:17:06,410
Yeah,
it's so bad.

384
00:17:06,411 --> 00:17:10,910
Or You fucking years ago and somebody 
needs to Redo that goddamn movie because

385
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:15,911
that's a fascinating thing.
Especially with Iowasca being so 

386
00:17:15,911 --> 00:17:15,911
popular,
you know,

387
00:17:15,911 --> 00:17:19,220
and isolation tanks were pretty God damn
popular right now to footloose instead.

388
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:24,640
I think it's amazing that isolation 
tanks a lot of wildly popular is us a 

389
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,830
lot of walls popular is talking about on
the podcast and talk about it in videos,

390
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:30,140
you know,
that's incredible that no one is talking

391
00:17:30,141 --> 00:17:33,740
about one of the most amazing tools for 
the human mind ever created.

392
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:35,850
And it's not like it's a fucking,
you know,

393
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:39,670
one of those things that they had to 
build in the movie contact and it cost a

394
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:44,670
billion dollars.
You need fucking cranes to put it into 

395
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:44,670
place.
Now.

396
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:47,381
It's so fucking simple.
I mean there's directions for building 

397
00:17:47,381 --> 00:17:47,381
these goddamn things on the Internet.
Was the movie in Three d?

398
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,590
Um,
no,

399
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:49,880
not,
not the one I did.

400
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:52,440
I was not in three D.
I don't know if it is in three d.

401
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:54,360
I don't know.
I'm not aware of what truly crazy,

402
00:17:54,361 --> 00:17:56,640
but it was awesome.
My witness,

403
00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:00,480
we went to philly about 18 months ago,
two years ago and we ran out of weed.

404
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:06,080
If somebody gave us a joint on the way 
to the club and the same thing happened 

405
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,891
to us.
So you don't fucking remember when we 

406
00:18:09,891 --> 00:18:10,260
brought them.
Need to fill this shit was probably less

407
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:15,290
than what was the DJ gave it to us.
It was one of the guys who works at the 

408
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:16,290
radio station and all four of us were 
like,

409
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,690
we don't want no more and it's something
that you really have to think about that

410
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:22,610
I got to come out here and pay $300 an 
ounce and back.

411
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:25,650
They're 1:25
and they get fucking bullets.

412
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:26,350
Yeah,
they,

413
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:28,700
they're getting that,
that indycar the craziest.

414
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:34,490
It's Brown and it's fucking strong.
It's definitely a different highs.

415
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:37,630
Definitely a different vibe that I got.
Was that east coast high?

416
00:18:37,631 --> 00:18:38,620
It was,
it's um,

417
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:43,870
it's silly.
It's a silly high and you don't like 

418
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:43,870
think we weren't thinking about the 
universe,

419
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:45,810
but I was very sensitive to this whole 
situation,

420
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:47,010
you know,
it was like,

421
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:49,440
you know,
it made me feel like,

422
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:54,470
man,
you know what a black people have and 

423
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:54,470
they are fucking Tyler Perry,
you know,

424
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:55,500
they have Tyler Perry,
that's their mogul.

425
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:56,970
That's the guy who's making a lot of 
movies.

426
00:18:56,971 --> 00:18:57,770
And so these,
Goddamn,

427
00:18:57,790 --> 00:18:59,970
I ate a movies.
And what else does it.

428
00:18:59,971 --> 00:19:01,380
I mean,
so there's not that many movies.

429
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:05,130
Every three months they put out an all 
black funeral,

430
00:19:05,131 --> 00:19:08,220
which was horrendously bad.
It's sad man.

431
00:19:08,221 --> 00:19:09,510
I mean for every spike.
Lee,

432
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:12,450
how many fucking real good.
Every John Singleton,

433
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,450
how many real good representatives for 
black people are there out there?

434
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,880
You know,
it's Kinda,

435
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:21,900
it's.
It was really interesting to be in a 

436
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:21,900
black theater and you had a good.
I had a great fall.

437
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,160
You know what?
I have a good time on Tuesdays.

438
00:19:23,161 --> 00:19:28,161
You want to have a good time with black 
people and I'm not being fucking 

439
00:19:28,161 --> 00:19:28,161
prejudice for funny.
I'm just.

440
00:19:28,161 --> 00:19:30,420
See if you want to see black people,
their natural environment,

441
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:33,090
you go to fucking Popeye's chicken on 
Tuesdays.

442
00:19:33,091 --> 00:19:36,750
They give you a wing and a breast for 
ninety nine cents and I made the mistake

443
00:19:36,751 --> 00:19:37,410
one night.
I got to tell you,

444
00:19:37,411 --> 00:19:38,300
you want to go?
I like Bob.

445
00:19:38,301 --> 00:19:40,040
I strictly what you love.
Spicy,

446
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:41,580
spicy.
We had that at the end.

447
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:45,750
I went to Popeye's chicken and it and 
it's a one on Laurel Canyon.

448
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:50,840
Like if you go to Popeye's chicken 
around Hollywood and it's full of full 

449
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:51,570
of brothers name,
nothing you could do,

450
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,950
but Laurel Canyon,
you ain't going to be a brother.

451
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:56,340
I didn't even think about it,
but either way and I'd been there before

452
00:19:56,341 --> 00:20:01,050
on a Sunday at least a special.
It's a wing and a breast for ninety nine

453
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:04,170
cents dog.
They'd come out of the woodwork for this

454
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,930
path when you understand me around the 
corner,

455
00:20:06,931 --> 00:20:10,020
but the best ones I've seen a real 
mother fucking gangster brother.

456
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:11,700
This guy,
8:20

457
00:20:11,701 --> 00:20:13,470
pieces of chicken and didn't get off the
phone.

458
00:20:13,471 --> 00:20:17,210
Now one flip and time.
That's a real bad motherfucker.

459
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:22,530
The only time he got off the phone was 
as the bitch for hot sauce and still sat

460
00:20:22,531 --> 00:20:27,531
there and watched the whole certificate 
on the bones are breaking them in half 

461
00:20:27,531 --> 00:20:28,330
while he was on the phone to call his 
bitch out.

462
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,750
Fuck it.
I'm getting my.

463
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:32,280
Another thing that people got mad at me 
for,

464
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,820
for asking,
why is it that I keep seeing black dudes

465
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:39,180
talking on speakerphone out loud by 
themselves.

466
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,870
I see it all the time and public black 
dudes holding the phone.

467
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,130
The next phase go yo what it is.
Oh,

468
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:50,150
okay.
And they're talking on the phone when 

469
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:50,150
it's not near their face.

470
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:54,870
We talked about this once,
but my ex people got mad at my ex 

471
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:54,870
girlfriend does that too?

472
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:58,360
She's black.
Will add so much flavor flavor to the 

473
00:20:59,000 --> 00:20:59,630
world.
Oh,

474
00:20:59,631 --> 00:21:04,631
if it wasn't for these fucking black 
people would just be a bunch of cowboys 

475
00:21:04,631 --> 00:21:07,190
on oysters listening to fucking think 
about white people from Utah.

476
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:11,930
They fucking entertaining drove my wife 
this morning at 7:00

477
00:21:11,931 --> 00:21:16,931
you had to go get a blood test 
assumptions done at Kaiser on the way 

478
00:21:16,931 --> 00:21:19,931
back.
I cut back to two and I went to North 

479
00:21:19,931 --> 00:21:19,931
Hollywood park.
You ready for this one?

480
00:21:19,931 --> 00:21:21,620
This is food for thought.
There wasn't a soul in Hollywood park,

481
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:24,380
north Hollywood park,
but black people teach them karate,

482
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:26,780
north Hollywood park.
Beautiful Park.

483
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:28,310
You know those squirrels will let you 
feed them.

484
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:28,850
Oh,
please.

485
00:21:28,851 --> 00:21:33,851
It's a beautiful fucking part is a dude 
and Chinese dude that sits out there 

486
00:21:33,851 --> 00:21:34,460
with a bag of squatting back at Magnolia
to hunting their dog.

487
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:37,260
That's a great fucking dog dog dog talk.

488
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:42,270
His language guy sits out.
This Chinese guy sits out there with a 

489
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:44,870
fucking peanut and he'll just have a bag
of m and he lies on his back and he puts

490
00:21:44,871 --> 00:21:47,450
his hands out and those girls come up 
and they just hang out with that dude.

491
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:49,790
They take the things like they don't 
even run,

492
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:52,160
didn't even back up before they eat.
They eat right there.

493
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:54,440
They just take it right from them.
That's a great fucking park.

494
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:57,800
It's one of my favorite color is black 
dudes doing karate.

495
00:21:58,130 --> 00:22:03,130
Karate sticks doing forms,
but they're out there doing 

496
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:08,380
motherfucking karate.
Only brothers go to and you really want 

497
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:08,870
this.
There's two movies I've seen.

498
00:22:08,871 --> 00:22:12,680
The black movie dealer was the one movie
was rambled too.

499
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:15,200
I told you the other day,
but the best movie ever.

500
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:18,670
I seen the one about the black.
What's the guy when he comes?

501
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:23,710
I'm the black show gun to Harlem.
I've seen that in Harlem and last Dragon

502
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:27,280
Dragon was entertainment like I'm sure 
that's a great movie.

503
00:22:27,281 --> 00:22:29,000
This headache.
If I ever make enough money,

504
00:22:29,001 --> 00:22:34,001
I would just buy a black.
We didn't just go there and laughed my 

505
00:22:34,001 --> 00:22:34,340
ass off,
fucked up,

506
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:36,920
and you go over to this one.
What's this one on sunset?

507
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:42,040
The atrium.
What's that one $90 to go to the movie 

508
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,561
data's quite fucking dollars.
I went last year 20 tool and for 50 for 

509
00:22:45,921 --> 00:22:50,921
a sausage sandwich and I just want to 
see a fucking movie guide's $90 of the 

510
00:22:50,921 --> 00:22:51,950
food that I just want to see a fucking 
movie.

511
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,750
I worked new Jack City opening night in 
Columbus,

512
00:22:54,751 --> 00:22:56,610
Ohio.
One of the scariest movie theaters.

513
00:22:56,830 --> 00:22:58,930
You don't want to go to a.
This is the difference.

514
00:22:58,931 --> 00:23:01,560
You don't want to go see a gangster 
black neighborhood.

515
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:03,550
No,
definitely want to go see a martial arts

516
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,010
martial arts film or an action film

517
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:11,630
to sit in the back of the theater the 
whole time and watched that movie 

518
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:12,570
because it was like midnight opening 
night.

519
00:23:12,571 --> 00:23:14,430
New Jack City.
I'm sitting in the back.

520
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:18,600
I'm a white general manager.
All my staff is black and so I'm sitting

521
00:23:18,601 --> 00:23:20,250
there like,
what is this new Jack City movie?

522
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:21,360
Watch the head,
the watch,

523
00:23:21,361 --> 00:23:23,250
the whole thing,
and there was fights.

524
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:26,670
There was one time where this lady 
started hitting this other lady and went

525
00:23:26,671 --> 00:23:28,920
into the hallway and I had to like kick 
him out.

526
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:34,070
It was the one that the most scariest 
moments of my life work in that movie 

527
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:34,560
and one of the best movies ever saw too,
so.

528
00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:36,960
Well one of the best ones that houses I 
had but went to,

529
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:40,640
we went to Asbury park for Halloween to 
a haunted mansion,

530
00:23:40,641 --> 00:23:45,641
the city of North Bergen,
rented buses and they took you to 

531
00:23:45,641 --> 00:23:45,641
different places and we went down and 
they,

532
00:23:45,641 --> 00:23:46,520
this thing,
the Brigantine Casper,

533
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:48,860
I think I told you already.
We went in there and you know,

534
00:23:48,861 --> 00:23:52,790
they got Dracula and Frankenstein when 
you walk around and boom,

535
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:58,100
I supposed to get scared bro.
We had to beat like maybe 12 and a half 

536
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:58,910
and you know,
you got a little scared.

537
00:23:58,911 --> 00:24:01,160
We didn't smoke dope that or not.
Then we just walking around.

538
00:24:01,161 --> 00:24:06,161
But Bro,
that Dracula bumped into a Black Dude 

539
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:08,460
Dracula.
He said,

540
00:24:08,461 --> 00:24:10,980
what the fuck you and these guys were 
from east orange.

541
00:24:10,981 --> 00:24:13,590
That was the other time that was.
And this guy looked at him.

542
00:24:13,591 --> 00:24:18,591
He was like,
what the Fuck is wrong with Dracula 

543
00:24:18,591 --> 00:24:18,591
motherfucker?
They started beating the fuck.

544
00:24:18,591 --> 00:24:21,270
They were 12 just like us.
We thought we were bad.

545
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:22,630
They started

546
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:30,730
get to them like 16 little black dudes.
I never laughed so hard in my life that 

547
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:32,920
they fucked dracula.
By the time I got out,

548
00:24:32,921 --> 00:24:34,710
the cops were there and nobody could cop
to it.

549
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,820
They had the kids with their hands up 
against the wall.

550
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:37,780
You don't fuck with it.

551
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:40,900
It takes a broad spectrum of people to 
make this world interesting.

552
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:45,960
You know?
And that is true that if you look at 

553
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:45,960
like our culture,
first of all stand up comedy,

554
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,710
you know,
besides Lenny Bruce,

555
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:50,410
the number one contributor is black 
comics.

556
00:24:50,411 --> 00:24:52,180
Richard Pryor,
you know,

557
00:24:52,181 --> 00:24:54,700
in later years,
Eddie Murphy,

558
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,660
Eddie Murphy contributed and Chris Rock,
they're the real greats.

559
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:02,260
You look at music,
there's so much black music,

560
00:25:02,261 --> 00:25:06,730
so much black influence on led Zepplin 
even on fucking Leonard Skinner,

561
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:07,540
man,
you know,

562
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:12,570
Lennon skinner,
they were influenced by a lot of black 

563
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:12,570
guys.
That fucking song,

564
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:16,531
the ballot of Curtis Loew Amazing.
I'm writing song about a black guy in 

565
00:25:16,531 --> 00:25:18,670
the south who's teaching them how to 
play the blues,

566
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:24,010
you know,
or playing the blues form when he was a 

567
00:25:24,010 --> 00:25:24,010
little kid at.
It's.

568
00:25:24,010 --> 00:25:24,460
It's a.
It was a fun experience.

569
00:25:24,461 --> 00:25:26,470
We had a great God downtime at that 
movie.

570
00:25:26,471 --> 00:25:27,190
Did.
It didn't matter.

571
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:29,650
There was babies talking.
It didn't matter because that was,

572
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:34,830
that was the,
that was the experience that we signed 

573
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:34,830
up for and I'll tell you what,
man,

574
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:37,510
Ilana dudes saying Shit and made the 
movie better.

575
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:40,090
There was one scene with the do goes,
oh,

576
00:25:40,091 --> 00:25:43,670
he running shit now.
And everybody started laughing.

577
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:49,030
Diane,
they started shyman in with their own 

578
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:49,230
shit and the women were talking to each,
oh,

579
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,830
he'd be like this,
look at that.

580
00:25:50,831 --> 00:25:55,831
Motherfucker was happy and it was just 
back and forth and it went on for a few 

581
00:25:55,831 --> 00:25:59,640
seconds where as long as everybody 
thought it was acceptable and then the 

582
00:25:59,640 --> 00:25:59,640
movie kept going,
but it was.

583
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:03,600
They made the movie louder.
The movie was really loud and I was 

584
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:03,600
wondering like,
I wonder,

585
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:08,530
they may get loud because people talk in
the movie theater a wonder because it 

586
00:26:08,530 --> 00:26:12,121
was loud as fuck,
but it was such an action movie that 

587
00:26:12,121 --> 00:26:12,630
there's not a lot of moments in that 
movie that where there's like,

588
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,230
you need quiet,
you know,

589
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:16,930
the movies are good goddamn movie man.

590
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:19,120
They did it good.
Like I was wondering,

591
00:26:19,121 --> 00:26:19,630
you know,
it was like,

592
00:26:19,631 --> 00:26:22,360
well I bet the CGI will be cool,
but maybe it would be corny.

593
00:26:22,361 --> 00:26:27,361
Like I didn't like cowboys and aliens.
I went to see cowboys and aliens and it 

594
00:26:27,361 --> 00:26:28,120
was good.
It was a good movie.

595
00:26:28,121 --> 00:26:33,121
I mean I didn't hate it,
but it was like kind of all over the 

596
00:26:33,121 --> 00:26:35,851
road and I'm a huge fan of Jon favreau 
and I thought that Ironman was fucking 

597
00:26:35,851 --> 00:26:36,310
awesome and I just love him.
Anyway,

598
00:26:36,311 --> 00:26:40,030
I love him from swingers and I've met 
him a couple times and he's super cool.

599
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:41,860
So it was really looking forward to it 
and I,

600
00:26:41,861 --> 00:26:45,480
I love a good alien movie and I love a 
good cowboy movie.

601
00:26:45,481 --> 00:26:46,650
I'm like,
this is going to be perfect.

602
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:51,860
So I was kind of expecting that that 
planet of the apes would kind of be 

603
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:55,371
like,
that sorta was probably a lot like that 

604
00:26:55,371 --> 00:26:55,371
level.

605
00:26:55,371 --> 00:26:55,371
No way,
dude.

606
00:26:55,371 --> 00:26:57,510
It was a strong nine strong,
nine out of 10.

607
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:59,640
The fucking.
First of all,

608
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:04,730
you realize how pathetic and fleshy 
human beings are when you see like 

609
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,360
[inaudible] they,
they dead.

610
00:27:06,361 --> 00:27:08,520
These chimps,
super realistic.

611
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:11,430
You know,
and you think of like a super athlete,

612
00:27:11,431 --> 00:27:13,200
like a Ray Lewis,
you know,

613
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:14,940
like,
think like a brock Lesnar,

614
00:27:14,941 --> 00:27:17,730
like the biggest,
strongest super athlete,

615
00:27:17,731 --> 00:27:22,731
human.
And you'd look at what like a hundred 

616
00:27:22,731 --> 00:27:24,720
and 50 pound chimp does in this movie.
She has run shit,

617
00:27:24,930 --> 00:27:29,930
throws things around.
Like the way he handles people was so 

618
00:27:29,930 --> 00:27:30,060
realistic.
It was really,

619
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:32,610
it was really fucking well done,
man.

620
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:37,730
The CGI you're watching it,
you could still come to town that it's 

621
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:39,420
not really a champ,
but only in the face.

622
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:42,300
Only like the ways face moves for the 
one that was like real human,

623
00:27:42,301 --> 00:27:44,700
like just a little bit.
I mean I hair,

624
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:49,800
they're so close,
but the gorilla God damn the gorilla 

625
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,130
looks good.

626
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:52,380
There's some scenes where this gorilla 
shows up,

627
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:55,740
the gorilla just run shit,
but I don't want to tell you anymore.

628
00:27:55,770 --> 00:27:57,360
I can't tell you anything.
No spoilers,

629
00:27:57,510 --> 00:28:02,510
but just the way they did it,
they'll fucking the way they're able to 

630
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:06,651
have these artificial things interact 
with what looks like a real physical 

631
00:28:06,651 --> 00:28:10,320
environment like this,
jump this gorilla smashing things and it

632
00:28:10,321 --> 00:28:12,000
looks real as fuck,
man.

633
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:17,030
It looks real as fuck,
but you're getting a a gorilla to do 

634
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:17,030
some shit you could never get a real 
gorilla to do.

635
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:19,650
You couldn't get a real gorilla that act
exactly the way you want it,

636
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:24,830
but that's what it looks like.
It's going to be crazy as in five years 

637
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:27,591
when you rewatch that movie,
it's gonna look shit like shit like 

638
00:28:27,591 --> 00:28:30,501
going to see I am legend.
That stupid scene where the lions walk 

639
00:28:30,501 --> 00:28:30,540
out like as fake gas line.

640
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:35,660
It ruins the whole movie for me.
Like I think they shouldn't have had 

641
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:36,750
that scene because that line looks so 
stupid.

642
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:40,110
Like I can't believe they accepted that 
stupid looking fake line.

643
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:42,750
This is not like that.
This is way better than that.

644
00:28:42,751 --> 00:28:45,600
This is the next level.
This is next level shit.

645
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:48,210
It's a good plot to.
It's well made.

646
00:28:48,211 --> 00:28:51,210
It's well directed.
It keeps you fucking captivated.

647
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:56,070
It's a perfect summer movie.
Best summer movie next to red state.

648
00:28:56,430 --> 00:28:59,910
I went to see red state last week.
I went to Kevin Smith,

649
00:28:59,911 --> 00:29:03,210
invited me to go to a screening and I 
sat right next to mark Marin,

650
00:29:03,211 --> 00:29:04,890
which is another of kiss.
We did.

651
00:29:04,891 --> 00:29:06,060
We hugged,
we did dog.

652
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:07,680
We made up.
We made up.

653
00:29:07,730 --> 00:29:09,710
He actually apologized because uh,
you know,

654
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,850
I talked about on the podcast.
He's so fucking negative.

655
00:29:11,851 --> 00:29:13,000
I'm like,
why you say you know,

656
00:29:13,010 --> 00:29:13,920
what the fuck man.

657
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:15,630
And that we went over some shit on the 
podcast.

658
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:17,910
He totally copped to it.
And so you're right,

659
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:19,110
I apologize,
I'm sorry.

660
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:22,740
And we were cool like right away and he 
looked really happy too,

661
00:29:22,741 --> 00:29:27,741
is with this really pretty girl.
His girlfriend girls real pretty and 

662
00:29:27,741 --> 00:29:28,260
he's doing real good now.
Just got back from Chicago.

663
00:29:28,261 --> 00:29:30,750
He's telling me sold out these shows.
So he felt like real good.

664
00:29:30,751 --> 00:29:32,940
So he felt good.
He looked good and you know,

665
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,070
it's like people just need some,
some success.

666
00:29:35,071 --> 00:29:36,510
They just need some happiness in their 
life,

667
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:41,540
you know,
now he's got a girlfriend and she's 

668
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:42,130
really pretty and she seemed really nice
and obviously love each other together.

669
00:29:42,131 --> 00:29:43,750
All Nice.
So it's like good,

670
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:48,880
good love.
So you got some love now and now you 

671
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:48,880
want to give the love back?
Yeah.

672
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:49,180
Terrific.
Anyway,

673
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:52,630
redstate is fucking bad ass.

674
00:29:52,810 --> 00:29:54,460
Kevin Smith made this movie,
right?

675
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:55,760
He didn't tell me Shit about it.
You.

676
00:29:55,770 --> 00:29:57,100
So dude,
I really want you to see this.

677
00:29:57,101 --> 00:29:58,750
I know you'll dig it.
Okay.

678
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,400
I'm,
he's a real nice guy.

679
00:30:00,401 --> 00:30:02,050
He's going to do.
He's doing the podcast next week.

680
00:30:02,051 --> 00:30:04,630
It's super nice guy.
I did his podcast.

681
00:30:04,631 --> 00:30:06,250
I love men.
And before I love the guy,

682
00:30:06,251 --> 00:30:07,260
he's.
I love him.

683
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:12,130
His movies that I've seen there.
There are always these silly comedies,

684
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,660
you know,
so I'm expecting,

685
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:16,630
I'm going to go see a Kevin Smith movie.
It's going to be a silly comedy.

686
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:22,260
We get there.
It is this apocalyptic like cult,

687
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:29,360
this cult that believes that Jesus is 
coming and that's what the movie's all 

688
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:33,601
about.
And how they interact with a bunch of 

689
00:30:33,601 --> 00:30:35,941
people.
I don't want to tell you anymore about 

690
00:30:35,941 --> 00:30:35,941
it,
but it's about this religious fanatic.

691
00:30:35,941 --> 00:30:36,460
It's like basically it's basically a 
horror movie,

692
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:38,660
you know,
it seems like it's kind of like,

693
00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:41,410
it's an action movie,
but it's really like a horror movie.

694
00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:43,720
And God damn is it good.
I mean,

695
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:48,130
is one of the best movies I've seen in 
fucking years better even than planet of

696
00:30:48,131 --> 00:30:49,920
the apes as good as I said,
of the aim.

697
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:53,170
Redstate is slightly better.
It's good.

698
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:53,990
Stephen Root.
Rude,

699
00:30:53,991 --> 00:30:58,991
isn't it?
Stephen Root is fucking bad ass in this 

700
00:30:58,991 --> 00:30:58,991
movie,
man.

701
00:30:58,991 --> 00:31:00,110
And the dude who plays the,
um,

702
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:02,050
the dude who plays the,
uh,

703
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:04,110
the guy,
um,

704
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:07,510
I don't want the fuck is his name.
The dude who plays the,

705
00:31:07,511 --> 00:31:09,450
um,
there's a guy who plays the um,

706
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:15,000
John Goodman's in it too.
I don't know who the other guys they're 

707
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:15,100
appointed in the movie where John 
Goodman and goes,

708
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:18,550
no.
Michael Parks,

709
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:20,770
that's the guy's name.
Who plays the,

710
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:21,600
uh,
the,

711
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:23,740
the bad guy.
Fuck,

712
00:31:23,741 --> 00:31:25,270
is this guy good?
I mean,

713
00:31:25,271 --> 00:31:30,271
he's,
he's a guy who's been around a long ass 

714
00:31:30,271 --> 00:31:33,181
time.
Apparently it's got some crazy ass 

715
00:31:33,181 --> 00:31:33,181
stories,
um,

716
00:31:33,181 --> 00:31:33,370
about dudes trying to kill him.

717
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:37,900
John John hurt is that guy's name stamp.
Kevin's friends was telling me,

718
00:31:37,901 --> 00:31:42,901
he was like,
y'all got to tell you the whole story 

719
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:42,901
later.
But this guy is famous actor,

720
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:43,750
like literally tried to kill this dude 
twice,

721
00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:48,160
but this guy plays the.
He plays the preacher in this movie.

722
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:49,810
God Damn,
that's good.

723
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:52,240
John Goodman's in it.
God Damn is he good?

724
00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:56,140
There's no soundtrack to this movie.
So during the movie,

725
00:31:56,410 --> 00:31:58,450
what I loved about it,
one of the things I love,

726
00:31:58,451 --> 00:32:00,540
I hate when a movie gives me.
I mean,

727
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:02,560
I loved the planet of the Apes.
Don't get me wrong,

728
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:05,950
it's a well packaged,
entertaining vehicle.

729
00:32:05,951 --> 00:32:10,951
It's good,
but I don't like when a movie plays me 

730
00:32:10,951 --> 00:32:11,170
some fucking music and tells me how I'm 
supposed to think.

731
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:11,830
I don't,
that's,

732
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:15,430
that's retarded to me.
I've never enjoyed it.

733
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:17,680
I'll tolerate it,
you know.

734
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:21,160
But I always feel relieved when a movie 
doesn't have any music,

735
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:22,810
you know?
I don't need like the,

736
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:25,300
they start kissing and fucking violence 
play,

737
00:32:25,301 --> 00:32:30,301
get the fuck outta here.
Obviously there's good examples and bad 

738
00:32:30,301 --> 00:32:33,601
examples,
but there's definitely some movies that 

739
00:32:33,601 --> 00:32:34,090
the soundtrack is 90 percent of the 
movie [inaudible] I disagree.

740
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:37,570
I don't like it.
I don't mind it all and that's different

741
00:32:37,571 --> 00:32:38,400
man.
You're talking about.

742
00:32:38,401 --> 00:32:40,010
It's like some music with songs and

743
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:41,490
singing and shit.
I like to.

744
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:46,010
I don't mind when I hear led Zeppelin 
houses of the holy.

745
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:47,780
I know it's 74.
That's.

746
00:32:47,781 --> 00:32:50,150
I don't mind,
but I don't like what you're saying when

747
00:32:50,151 --> 00:32:52,830
you hear music to people dressing and 
them telling you.

748
00:32:52,831 --> 00:32:57,831
You know what I'm saying?
In the time period I said it wrong 

749
00:32:57,831 --> 00:33:02,180
because it's not that I don't like 
soundtracks because I do in goodfellas.

750
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,210
I like it when it's done the right way.
That's what I'm saying.

751
00:33:05,211 --> 00:33:08,870
He accepted up as a boogie nights.
I don't mind that your book,

752
00:33:09,090 --> 00:33:14,090
like you remember when the rolling 
stones or plan and he's coked up and 

753
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:17,771
he's got a bag full of guns in the trunk
and he's driving around in that movie.

754
00:33:19,851 --> 00:33:24,851
It works.
What I mean more is the werewolf is 

755
00:33:24,851 --> 00:33:27,881
running through the woods and you hear 
the fuck out of here with that.

756
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,970
Stupid Shit that drives me nuts.
I told them,

757
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:33,710
there's no music in this movie,
man.

758
00:33:33,711 --> 00:33:35,930
This music is.
This movie is brilliant.

759
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:39,830
It's kept you and Kevin Smith describes 
it as his talking dog movie.

760
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:41,720
He's like,
because if a dog started talking,

761
00:33:41,721 --> 00:33:42,770
he'd be like,
what the fuck?

762
00:33:43,010 --> 00:33:44,630
And he goes,
that's exactly what this movie is like.

763
00:33:44,631 --> 00:33:48,340
You don't expect it from Kevin Smith.
Did you see an early cut of it that they

764
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:49,910
know it's done.
It's done.

765
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,650
It's done.
The movie's done.

766
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:54,470
Kevin did it all himself.
He's going to release it all himself.

767
00:33:54,471 --> 00:33:55,830
He did it all himself.
No,

768
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,760
no one else had any involvement in it.
And that's the brilliant.

769
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:01,390
The brilliance of this movie.
He didn't,

770
00:34:01,391 --> 00:34:03,890
you know,
he was gonna do a mass release of it,

771
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:07,610
but I guess it was just too expensive.
So he's going to release it in a limited

772
00:34:07,611 --> 00:34:08,820
way just so that it's,
it's,

773
00:34:08,821 --> 00:34:09,430
um,
uh,

774
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:14,620
eligible for the Oscars and then they're
going to do it video on demand I think 

775
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:14,660
in September.

776
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:17,070
And you know,
you can get it on DVD and all that shit.

777
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:19,880
I'm sorry.
It was a really weird thing,

778
00:34:19,881 --> 00:34:24,881
Joe Rogan,
that you mentioned that I have to stick 

779
00:34:24,881 --> 00:34:24,881
up for this for the seventies timepiece 
though,

780
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:27,560
when we watch a movie and it trump 
seventies now,

781
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:29,940
it's unbearable to watch,
but if you really.

782
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:32,660
Not always though,
except for the Godfather,

783
00:34:32,690 --> 00:34:34,190
there's a bunch of movies that are still
good,

784
00:34:34,390 --> 00:34:37,910
like a hard time.
You could watch maybe if it's not 11:00

785
00:34:37,911 --> 00:34:40,040
ever see friends of Eddie coyle.
Tremendous.

786
00:34:40,490 --> 00:34:42,530
Tremendous.
This fucking movie.

787
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:44,030
I got turned onto that bike.
Anthony.

788
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:46,340
I'm Anthony Bourdain.
No reservations.

789
00:34:46,341 --> 00:34:51,341
Well,
if I showed you a bother you when I saw 

790
00:34:51,341 --> 00:34:51,341
bad ass move,
I just wanted and I thought fuck it.

791
00:34:51,341 --> 00:34:53,900
Movie Theater.
I just went about a month ago.

792
00:34:53,901 --> 00:34:56,150
They had it for.
I like movie.

793
00:34:56,151 --> 00:34:59,030
I always go to the dog or where's this 
place?

794
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:01,160
The place in beverly.
Beverly.

795
00:35:01,161 --> 00:35:03,380
Beverly.
I go there when you can't find me.

796
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:05,090
I'm at the bellboy for five bucks,
Bro.

797
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:06,860
I ain't got time to waste with people no
more.

798
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:08,540
I go to the back.
All those memories.

799
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,600
I want to see him on the big screen.
Yeah,

800
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:11,530
the friends.
Eddie quote,

801
00:35:11,531 --> 00:35:13,030
look at the cast in.
They're great.

802
00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:15,770
What's the name of the storming that,
bro.

803
00:35:15,771 --> 00:35:17,060
How bad is it?
Oh yeah,

804
00:35:17,061 --> 00:35:17,330
yeah,
yeah.

805
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:21,500
What's his name was Eddie coils name 
that guy to me.

806
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:23,290
He reminds me for some reason.
Got a laugh.

807
00:35:23,310 --> 00:35:26,300
He just like a brock Lesnar,
but the way he talks to people,

808
00:35:26,301 --> 00:35:31,301
Bro,
the way he would talk to people in the 

809
00:35:31,301 --> 00:35:31,301
Robert Mitchum the fuck the size of his 
hands.

810
00:35:31,301 --> 00:35:34,500
Have you seen the dude that's a big 
motherfucking country bumpkin that.

811
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,860
But you want me to tell you something 
about the seventies.

812
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:38,100
Tell me something about the seven years

813
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:43,170
old.
Better movies came out and in the 

814
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:43,230
seventies really let's get down every 
which way,

815
00:35:43,231 --> 00:35:44,070
but loose.
No,

816
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:47,250
let's just talk about the excesses 
because father,

817
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,070
let's just talk about planet of the apes
because Bro,

818
00:35:50,071 --> 00:35:53,210
let's get down to first.
I came from I what?

819
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:54,540
Rocky.
Rocky.

820
00:35:54,541 --> 00:35:59,541
I came from Cuba and the first movie,
one of the first one was I went to see 

821
00:35:59,541 --> 00:36:02,811
was beneath the planet of the apes.
At the time I lived on 88th street and 

822
00:36:02,811 --> 00:36:03,990
Broadway.
Fuck.

823
00:36:03,991 --> 00:36:08,991
All these motherfuckers.
If you look beneath the planet of the 

824
00:36:08,991 --> 00:36:11,661
apes,
they were under the subway systems 

825
00:36:11,661 --> 00:36:11,661
really in New York City.
Look at beneath.

826
00:36:11,661 --> 00:36:11,700
You got to start from scratch.
Dawn,

827
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:14,270
you're not going to send me the planet x
unless you start from scratch.

828
00:36:14,530 --> 00:36:16,430
I don't have to sell it to fucking 
awesome.

829
00:36:16,431 --> 00:36:19,300
You don't remember the part where you 
can torture yourself by not going to say

830
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,540
I'm going to go see it,
but what I'm trying to say to you is you

831
00:36:21,541 --> 00:36:22,620
have to watch that again.

832
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,360
I've seen it.
I just haven't seen in years.

833
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:25,830
You got to check yourself.
That's all.

834
00:36:25,831 --> 00:36:27,000
I'm [inaudible] 70,
19,

835
00:36:27,001 --> 00:36:29,430
70.
When they put their mask off,

836
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:31,560
I came home and I remember telling my 
mom,

837
00:36:31,561 --> 00:36:36,561
mom,
these apes live under the fucking 

838
00:36:36,561 --> 00:36:36,561
subway.
Like they sold me on it.

839
00:36:36,561 --> 00:36:40,340
It's all through New York number.
They get by the Statue of Liberty 

840
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:40,340
member.
That shot did flux.

841
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:42,060
CGI,
CGI.

842
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:46,580
The Statue of Liberty backed over.
And then what's the blond guy number?

843
00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:48,630
The first one with the girl.
Come on guy.

844
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,010
What's the fruit?
The gap.

845
00:36:50,050 --> 00:36:55,050
Get the girl out,
a hot girl that couldn't even fucking 

846
00:36:55,050 --> 00:36:55,200
clock and he was running Jane Fonda.
No,

847
00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:57,600
no.
The first one killed it.

848
00:36:57,780 --> 00:37:00,090
It was 1970.
Everybody's mad at over Vietnam.

849
00:37:00,091 --> 00:37:03,450
Still rose to planet of the apes.
Raquel Welsh.

850
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:04,920
No baby.
I don't think so.

851
00:37:04,930 --> 00:37:06,720
First Raquel was.
We wouldn't be it right now.

852
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:12,120
Is the frozen right now.
Everybody would've been jerking off the 

853
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:13,590
depths.
You 1968.

854
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:15,900
What was the original chicken?
That chicken that couldn't.

855
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,270
Kim Hunter,
Bro.

856
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:20,370
I don't know what it was.
But next time you get a minute,

857
00:37:20,371 --> 00:37:22,740
just watch the first two again.
Get really.

858
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,040
You're giving me the gimbal.
Ever see that movie?

859
00:37:25,041 --> 00:37:27,080
I returned to the valley of the dolls 
are.

860
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:30,470
What the fuck is wrong with that movie?
Is that Jane Fonda?

861
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:31,520
Was that?
No,

862
00:37:31,521 --> 00:37:34,520
it wasn't Jane Fonda.
It was written by Roger Ebert.

863
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:35,330
Ebro.
Yes.

864
00:37:35,530 --> 00:37:40,530
You fucking did it.
I sat there and seriously tried to 

865
00:37:40,530 --> 00:37:40,530
follow that movie.
That makes zero sense.

866
00:37:40,770 --> 00:37:43,330
Hunter was one of the monkeys.
It's Linda Harrison.

867
00:37:43,331 --> 00:37:45,810
She's the bad ass bitch.
Oh God damn.

868
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:48,580
Is She hot?
You got to watch the first two,

869
00:37:48,581 --> 00:37:49,330
bro.
I'm sorry,

870
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:52,690
the Heston is a bad motherfucker too,
and he's like 50.

871
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,380
Did you know Robert Herbert wrote a 
movie

872
00:37:55,490 --> 00:37:59,100
and it's one of those stories so bad in 
the whole entire was.

873
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:01,040
Of course it is and that's why he's a 
critic.

874
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:02,540
Listen,
I've always said this.

875
00:38:02,541 --> 00:38:07,541
I've met some good critics.
I met some cool people who are fans of 

876
00:38:07,541 --> 00:38:09,110
movies and there's no hard fast rule to 
anything.

877
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:11,900
There's a lot of people like Doug Benson
might as well be a critic.

878
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:14,930
He's a huge movie,
but he's still a very good comic,

879
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:16,610
but he's a.
he's a huge movie,

880
00:38:16,611 --> 00:38:21,611
but he might as well be a critic,
but most critics are critics because 

881
00:38:21,611 --> 00:38:24,581
they got nothing to contribute.
That's why they don't want to be 

882
00:38:24,581 --> 00:38:24,581
critics.
They really want to.

883
00:38:24,581 --> 00:38:25,180
They want to be writers.
They want to be screenwriters.

884
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:26,960
You want to be authors.
They don't have anything to say.

885
00:38:26,990 --> 00:38:28,160
I don't believe critics.
Anyway,

886
00:38:28,970 --> 00:38:29,810
sometimes it wrong.

887
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:32,340
God,
I thought I saw Doug Benson said that he

888
00:38:32,341 --> 00:38:36,090
hated that the new planet of the apes 
movie didn't fun at the CGI.

889
00:38:36,110 --> 00:38:37,020
Everything.
Let me just start with that.

890
00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:42,050
For the Dragon,
which is one of the greatest martial 

891
00:38:42,050 --> 00:38:42,050
arts films,
all those seven of these movies,

892
00:38:42,050 --> 00:38:43,900
all those clint eastwood movies,
all those jobs,

893
00:38:43,901 --> 00:38:48,901
Bronson movies that were stealing from 
today that we're remaking all those 

894
00:38:48,901 --> 00:38:50,350
westerns.
Westerns were in the seventies.

895
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:54,790
So the time piece was fucking brilliant 
that the thinking was brilliant.

896
00:38:54,791 --> 00:38:57,000
It's not these momos knowledge.
Just remaking shit.

897
00:38:57,070 --> 00:39:01,160
What is the clinics would movie where he
plays a ghost to comes back to town.

898
00:39:01,161 --> 00:39:06,161
It fucks everybody.
Puts the shield on at the end and they 

899
00:39:06,161 --> 00:39:07,490
can shoot the body because the people 
don't shoot the head.

900
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:10,730
So every time they shoot the body he 
fall down and get back up.

901
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:11,510
No.
Yeah,

902
00:39:11,511 --> 00:39:12,800
that's the one.
He's a western.

903
00:39:12,801 --> 00:39:14,540
Yeah.
So they think he's dead.

904
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:15,000
No,
no,

905
00:39:15,001 --> 00:39:15,300
no,
no,

906
00:39:15,310 --> 00:39:18,110
no.
Dad came back to town to kill everybody.

907
00:39:18,170 --> 00:39:19,610
Oh my God.
Which one is that?

908
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:21,540
He came back to town to kill the whole 
10.

909
00:39:21,541 --> 00:39:25,700
They whipped him to death and he came 
back and he was raping bitches.

910
00:39:25,701 --> 00:39:30,701
Dude,
he raped this one chick and it's really 

911
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:30,701
kind of crazy.
Like the way they show it,

912
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:33,020
it was a real super realistic pitch in 
every movie.

913
00:39:33,021 --> 00:39:35,930
He always told them what time it was.
He raped her and he,

914
00:39:35,931 --> 00:39:40,931
he like,
he only fucked her for like four pumps 

915
00:39:40,931 --> 00:39:44,440
and I watched it with my friend John 
wants my friend John in New York and he 

916
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:46,760
goes,
see that's how we're supposed to fuck.

917
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:50,180
We're not supposed to fuck a girl for an
hour and make her come.

918
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:55,360
You're supposed to just fuck four times 
and shoot your low because that's what 

919
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:55,430
feels good.
And I was like,

920
00:39:55,431 --> 00:39:56,580
Whoa,
how crazy are you

921
00:39:56,660 --> 00:40:01,660
dude?
I am not Doug Benson at some other 

922
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:04,451
comic.
And I was really surprised because he 

923
00:40:04,451 --> 00:40:04,451
was the only person I saw that,
that didn't like that movie.

924
00:40:04,451 --> 00:40:04,451
Everyone was talking

925
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:08,030
high plains drifter.
It's a bad motherfucker right there too.

926
00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:10,450
That's what it is.
That's the one when they whip them.

927
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:11,540
You're right.
You're absolutely right.

928
00:40:11,541 --> 00:40:12,770
I Bro,
you know,

929
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:16,370
I got so many of those classics and 
that's not in the high plains.

930
00:40:16,371 --> 00:40:18,740
Drifter is another one.
God Damn it.

931
00:40:18,770 --> 00:40:21,940
What the fuck is the movie driving me 
nuts,

932
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:22,730
Ramos?
Shit,

933
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,060
I can't.
It's Rick Grandma,

934
00:40:24,061 --> 00:40:26,810
so master of Queens.
Really,

935
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:30,590
so one of us would have people would let
us know this for the good,

936
00:40:30,591 --> 00:40:33,120
the bad,
the ugly for a few dollars more.

937
00:40:33,121 --> 00:40:35,510
A fistful of dollars in high plains 
drifter.

938
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:38,720
It's got to be one of those.
Maybe this high plains drifter.

939
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:43,960
What's the one?
What he paints the town red paint the 

940
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:43,960
town white.
That's it.

941
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:43,960
The paint.
The town red.

942
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:48,640
When was the last time somebody painting
the town red in the last 20 years and 

943
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:48,640
you've seen the movie?
Nobody.

944
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:51,870
That was the original idea.
Ever paint this fucking.

945
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:54,360
What did he call the town to help?
Yeah.

946
00:40:54,361 --> 00:40:55,020
I'm.
This isn't.

947
00:40:55,030 --> 00:41:00,030
This is not the movie because in this 
one it says a stranger rides out of the 

948
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:01,750
hot desert into a small town in the wild
west towns.

949
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:04,890
People are scared of him and three 
gunmen try unsuccessfully to kill him.

950
00:41:04,891 --> 00:41:06,530
He takes her room and decides,
Oh yes,

951
00:41:06,531 --> 00:41:06,980
yes,
yes,

952
00:41:06,981 --> 00:41:07,670
yes,
yes.

953
00:41:09,470 --> 00:41:10,730
Yeah.
This just weird.

954
00:41:10,730 --> 00:41:12,470
Veered into a summary and they kill 
them.

955
00:41:12,471 --> 00:41:17,471
M One m one will they shoot them and the
people that shot him only shoot the body

956
00:41:18,501 --> 00:41:20,090
that don't shoot.
The head isn't hanging high,

957
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:24,560
so he fucking gets a shield and he 
builds a shield and he puts on his chest

958
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:27,110
and then when he approaches the people 
they would shoot at him,

959
00:41:27,111 --> 00:41:29,210
but he was thinking,
I think confusing movies.

960
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:30,030
Yeah,
we're confusing.

961
00:41:30,031 --> 00:41:33,530
All of them were confusing movies.
Just go home and put on tonight.

962
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:34,040
I

963
00:41:34,050 --> 00:41:34,740
got them all on my own.

964
00:41:34,930 --> 00:41:36,940
I have a great movie for you guys.
Both the watch.

965
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:39,420
It's a documentary,
a tiff,

966
00:41:39,550 --> 00:41:41,290
tiffany stockers.
Have you heard of it?

967
00:41:41,291 --> 00:41:43,180
It's called.
I think we're alone now.

968
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:48,620
It follows two guys that are a stock 
stockers of tiffany current stock or 

969
00:41:49,491 --> 00:41:54,491
current stockers and one of them was the
stalker like like 20 years ago or 15 

970
00:41:54,491 --> 00:41:59,371
years ago when she,
when she was really young and stuff and 

971
00:41:59,371 --> 00:42:03,330
one guy is a transsexual or transgender 
guidance deal going through being 

972
00:42:03,330 --> 00:42:07,170
becoming a woman and the other guy they 
both have ass Berger's disease or 

973
00:42:07,170 --> 00:42:09,370
whatever it's called and it's just like 
in the autism spectrum.

974
00:42:09,371 --> 00:42:10,010
Is that what that is?
Yeah.

975
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:13,390
It's like they're super,
super smart,

976
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:15,990
but they can't shut up about it,
you know,

977
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:19,090
like I can't stop talking about it and 
obsessing about whatever it is.

978
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:21,820
Coke,
smart people and smart people on Coke.

979
00:42:21,970 --> 00:42:26,970
But it is so interesting and the fact 
that they're both are backup like they 

980
00:42:26,970 --> 00:42:27,020
were both like,
oh yeah,

981
00:42:27,030 --> 00:42:29,920
if I would never be able to marry her,
but I,

982
00:42:29,930 --> 00:42:32,980
Alyssa Milano on the other hand and both
of them had like a backup.

983
00:42:32,981 --> 00:42:34,790
Alyssa Milano.
Yeah.

984
00:42:34,810 --> 00:42:36,340
And it's so weird.
It's on Netflix streaming.

985
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:37,900
I,
they all love Tiffany,

986
00:42:37,901 --> 00:42:39,770
but they couldn't marry her but they can
marry Alyssa.

987
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:44,920
Alyssa Milano was or more realistic girl
that they both were obsessed about it.

988
00:42:44,950 --> 00:42:47,380
It's more realistic.
Tiffany.

989
00:42:47,381 --> 00:42:52,381
Yeah.
Tiffany is married now or something and 

990
00:42:52,381 --> 00:42:52,630
they went through.
I have no idea.

991
00:42:53,770 --> 00:42:55,030
Yeah,
well I don't know,

992
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:56,700
but it's good.
So it's called,

993
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:59,170
what is it called?
Very creepy and very fun to watch.

994
00:42:59,171 --> 00:43:00,700
It's called.
I think we're alone now.

995
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:05,760
She's running after it was over.
There's another movie all about Dolly 

996
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:06,970
Parton stockers,
I forget the name of it,

997
00:43:06,971 --> 00:43:10,210
but there's five Dolly Parton stockers 
and I will watch that too.

998
00:43:10,211 --> 00:43:15,211
And it's also good.
So tiffany at the other one's about 

999
00:43:15,211 --> 00:43:15,211
Dolly Parton too.
So,

1000
00:43:15,211 --> 00:43:17,160
um,
high plains drifter is the movie that is

1001
00:43:17,170 --> 00:43:19,620
the more it comes back as a ghost and he
kills everybody.

1002
00:43:19,650 --> 00:43:24,650
They killed him.
They whipped him to death that I was in 

1003
00:43:24,650 --> 00:43:24,650
the seventies of all time.
Can't even fuck with it.

1004
00:43:24,750 --> 00:43:28,740
Warriors fucking.
You can't even fuck with it.

1005
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:31,500
The list goes on.
Can't even fuck with it.

1006
00:43:31,620 --> 00:43:34,100
Fuck box office.
I'm talking about creativity.

1007
00:43:34,101 --> 00:43:34,590
Yeah.
There was.

1008
00:43:35,010 --> 00:43:37,380
Once you know,
the getaway with McQueen was out.

1009
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:40,170
All the Charles Bronson,
great ones we've done in the seventies.

1010
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:42,990
All those movies were original.
These dumb fucks to the edges.

1011
00:43:42,991 --> 00:43:45,860
We making shit.
He's Momos with their fucking things are

1012
00:43:45,861 --> 00:43:50,861
going to see it go from shale writer.
I wouldn't go see none of that shit 

1013
00:43:50,861 --> 00:43:50,870
gone.
I don't go.

1014
00:43:51,090 --> 00:43:53,310
None of that shit.
Any of these movies that come up,

1015
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:58,340
nothing.
Not that I'm going to go see planet of 

1016
00:43:58,340 --> 00:43:58,340
the apes because I'm a planet of the 
apes guys since 1970.

1017
00:43:58,340 --> 00:44:00,330
I'm going to go give it a chance.
But besides that,

1018
00:44:00,331 --> 00:44:02,280
the all of these movies,
I wipe my ass with them.

1019
00:44:02,370 --> 00:44:03,290
All of them.
Well,

1020
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:05,880
I think something that was going on in 
the seventies,

1021
00:44:05,910 --> 00:44:07,830
same was going on with music.
You know,

1022
00:44:07,831 --> 00:44:10,200
I've been on this lennon skinner kick 
for the last month,

1023
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:12,680
or I listened to Leonard scanner like 
every fucking day.

1024
00:44:12,690 --> 00:44:14,290
I'm in my cd right now.
Every most,

1025
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:18,790
every day since I bought that CD.
I've been breweries.

1026
00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:21,720
It's brilliant.
It's brilliant.

1027
00:44:21,750 --> 00:44:24,370
And the story of what they do.
Don't,

1028
00:44:24,390 --> 00:44:27,480
don't ever Mark Leonard Skinner.
You Suck fucking weezer.

1029
00:44:27,590 --> 00:44:30,150
Listen,
this is garbage.

1030
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:35,180
It wasn't just say music today is so 
fucking bad for the fucking black keys 

1031
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:41,880
and fucking the foo fighters and later 
everybody else could suck my dick 

1032
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:44,280
because it's garbage.
It all sounds the same.

1033
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:46,150
Fucking black keys.
Throw that on.

1034
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:50,550
They got a video of them motherfuckers 
playing at Tennessee at a fucking record

1035
00:44:50,551 --> 00:44:50,880
store.

1036
00:44:51,030 --> 00:44:54,950
Go ahead and put it on airplane.
A fucking drum that's town.

1037
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,160
The foo fighters,
everything else,

1038
00:44:56,280 --> 00:45:01,280
all these kids send me these videos.
I look at these guys redoing black 

1039
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:02,580
Sabbath.
You can't redo black sabbath.

1040
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:07,640
Bitch can't redo black sabbath.
They'll oasis to always just suck my 

1041
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:12,561
dick dog.
They ain't the fucking racists they can 

1042
00:45:12,561 --> 00:45:12,561
do.
Did Black Sabbath,

1043
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:15,660
whatever the fuck it is,
they can't touch what's going on.

1044
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:18,250
What we grew up with,
garbage with.

1045
00:45:18,270 --> 00:45:20,440
The black keys are as real music 
musicians.

1046
00:45:20,441 --> 00:45:23,670
That's where the real music.
Now the music industry is dying and they

1047
00:45:23,671 --> 00:45:26,890
could blame it all they wanted to be.
Nobody wants to go see these people live

1048
00:45:26,930 --> 00:45:28,590
in your magical.
I love Rihanna,

1049
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:31,410
but it's 45 minutes of dead time.
If you go see Rehab,

1050
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:35,010
please don't stop the music and the 
others song just standing there watching

1051
00:45:35,011 --> 00:45:36,600
somebody sing over a fucking music.

1052
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:39,930
There's no instruments on stage and 
that's half of these shows.

1053
00:45:40,050 --> 00:45:41,640
Well,
it's also recession,

1054
00:45:41,641 --> 00:45:42,820
man.
It's hard to sell tickets.

1055
00:45:43,830 --> 00:45:46,940
Music is music where the eagles play 
last year for 3:50

1056
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:49,920
place was sold into the three nights.
Fuck the recession.

1057
00:45:49,921 --> 00:45:53,790
Music is music statuette all these old 
time.

1058
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:56,700
Is it coming back?
Because the new kids can't perform live.

1059
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:58,650
Really?
Go look at your schedules.

1060
00:45:58,651 --> 00:46:01,330
Everybody's back.
Even Steve Miller's,

1061
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:06,500
his grandson came.
You could go on stage and say you're 

1062
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:06,870
Steve Miller and no one would know the 
difference.

1063
00:46:06,871 --> 00:46:10,560
So nobody knows who steve fly like an 
eagle browse genius.

1064
00:46:11,130 --> 00:46:12,860
Jungle.
Love jungle.

1065
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:19,050
Listen to the fuck that motherfucking 
Steve Miller had to do the what?

1066
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:19,650
Oh yeah.

1067
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:24,900
Why tucked that?
Not More?

1068
00:46:25,130 --> 00:46:26,280
Yeah,
he was genius man.

1069
00:46:26,490 --> 00:46:28,800
Steve Miller is the only guy who made it
famous,

1070
00:46:28,801 --> 00:46:32,130
made huge hits,
and he just never got fucking picture.

1071
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:35,760
Why would you?
I know there's pictures of her,

1072
00:46:35,761 --> 00:46:37,590
but you know what Mick Jagger looks 
like,

1073
00:46:37,591 --> 00:46:38,820
man.
It's unmistakable.

1074
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:41,340
Mick Jagger walks into a restaurant.
You fucking go,

1075
00:46:41,341 --> 00:46:42,720
Oh shit.
Mick Jagger's here.

1076
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:47,310
Steve Miller can go to target and his 
underwear and no one knows that's true,

1077
00:46:47,311 --> 00:46:48,450
right?
That's weird.

1078
00:46:48,930 --> 00:46:53,930
What the fuck was going on in the 
seventies that led to this big creative 

1079
00:46:53,930 --> 00:46:56,490
explosion?
I mean the sixties and the seventies and

1080
00:46:56,510 --> 00:46:58,290
good acid.
No bullshit asset.

1081
00:46:58,350 --> 00:47:02,450
You had a brilliant bullshit when you're
reading and music outdoors here.

1082
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:05,050
Whenever the fuck they on what you can't
use,

1083
00:47:05,130 --> 00:47:10,130
your eating laxatives and was a cough 
drops because it was pure.

1084
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:16,710
The people were pure little less time to
fucking take off their mind.

1085
00:47:17,010 --> 00:47:21,150
We have all this garbage that take up 
our mind to creativity was more listened

1086
00:47:21,151 --> 00:47:23,780
to and everybody was great from Jimi 
Hendrix's shit.

1087
00:47:23,790 --> 00:47:26,430
Jimmy Hendrix pulled out,
listen to the cutting edge shit.

1088
00:47:26,790 --> 00:47:30,400
Fucking Leonard Skinner put and I was 
cutting edge.

1089
00:47:30,401 --> 00:47:31,270
There were,
let's face it,

1090
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:34,360
let's get down to.
Basically they were fucking rednecks guy

1091
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:35,800
from Florida.
Yeah.

1092
00:47:35,801 --> 00:47:37,790
You want me to some other rednecks.
Put the allman brothers.

1093
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:40,660
Not put all of those bands on.
These guys had nothing to lose.

1094
00:47:40,990 --> 00:47:42,130
They had nothing to lose,
Bro.

1095
00:47:42,220 --> 00:47:43,210
Joe,
you know what you need to do.

1096
00:47:43,211 --> 00:47:46,240
You need to do an info commercial for 
one of those cds like the songs that are

1097
00:47:46,241 --> 00:47:47,410
seventies.
Fuck.

1098
00:47:47,890 --> 00:47:48,630
You need a lesson?
Two,

1099
00:47:49,330 --> 00:47:51,310
hands down.
It's hands down.

1100
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:53,890
It doesn't even compare.
You can't even compare.

1101
00:47:54,310 --> 00:47:59,310
You haven't heard.
I haven't heard what lady Yankee Yankee 

1102
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:03,490
albums.
They can't cut the spread bro.

1103
00:48:03,790 --> 00:48:06,460
They can't do it.
Look at the whole 90 fucking albums,

1104
00:48:06,461 --> 00:48:08,680
led Zeppelin,
pink floyd,

1105
00:48:08,681 --> 00:48:12,040
put out four albums in a role that most 
bands could never even release.

1106
00:48:12,310 --> 00:48:14,710
Flood Piper and the gates of dawn and 
all that noise.

1107
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:16,720
What is that?
Just that's their first time,

1108
00:48:16,721 --> 00:48:19,630
which just freaky things.
People hidden cow bells and shit.

1109
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:23,050
They go for acid heads and that shit was
great.

1110
00:48:23,051 --> 00:48:23,770
Listen,
go,

1111
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:25,300
hit yourself in the head with a fucking 
habit.

1112
00:48:25,330 --> 00:48:29,500
Wasn't glue but metal,
dark side of the moon,

1113
00:48:29,530 --> 00:48:34,530
animals but war.
It's something that no abandons ever 

1114
00:48:34,530 --> 00:48:38,611
come out with five items in a row like 
how beautiful his dark side of the moon 

1115
00:48:38,611 --> 00:48:41,521
to where every song flows into the next 
flows and it saying that to do asset to 

1116
00:48:42,521 --> 00:48:47,521
that.
He's the prettiest thing in the world 

1117
00:48:47,521 --> 00:48:47,521
because pink floyd did something that 
nobody else did.

1118
00:48:47,521 --> 00:48:49,510
They tap into your soul when you do 
acid,

1119
00:48:49,690 --> 00:48:52,360
if you listen to all the music and 
always has the boom,

1120
00:48:52,361 --> 00:48:54,060
boom,
boom,

1121
00:48:54,070 --> 00:48:56,170
boom,
go book.

1122
00:48:56,270 --> 00:48:57,860
I got molested.
The comfortably Numb,

1123
00:48:57,861 --> 00:48:59,240
but really?
Yeah,

1124
00:48:59,241 --> 00:49:01,040
but it's 21 year old girl lived up the 
street.

1125
00:49:01,070 --> 00:49:03,310
You got molested a girl also.
I was 13.

1126
00:49:03,330 --> 00:49:05,030
She was 21,
she was in town slut,

1127
00:49:05,060 --> 00:49:07,430
she molested everybody on that.
She didn't do much,

1128
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:09,770
just kinda grabbed my dick,
but it was like,

1129
00:49:09,771 --> 00:49:10,750
Whoa,
that's just the.

1130
00:49:10,930 --> 00:49:13,430
But it was crazy because she had like A.
I think I've told this story before.

1131
00:49:13,431 --> 00:49:16,670
She had a grown man who was a boyfriend.
He had hair on his chest and shit.

1132
00:49:16,671 --> 00:49:18,530
I was a little boy.
I was 13,

1133
00:49:18,531 --> 00:49:20,540
but this girl was all kinds of fucked 
up.

1134
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:23,510
But she turned me onto a lot of 
seventies music man.

1135
00:49:23,780 --> 00:49:26,270
This crazy bitch was into.
She was into Zeplin.

1136
00:49:26,510 --> 00:49:30,500
She turned me on to black dog and she 
turned me onto a comfortably numb,

1137
00:49:31,780 --> 00:49:35,110
not like pink floyd passage shit.
That's what they were doing.

1138
00:49:35,170 --> 00:49:40,170
Everything that everybody talked about.
All these people that wrote books on 

1139
00:49:40,170 --> 00:49:40,210
acid,
they did it through music,

1140
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:42,400
which everybody could suck my dick.
That's globally.

1141
00:49:42,401 --> 00:49:43,880
We're talking about drugs and 
psychedelics.

1142
00:49:43,910 --> 00:49:45,780
This is a great story about,
um,

1143
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,890
Roger Waters in rolling stone that I 
read.

1144
00:49:48,891 --> 00:49:50,690
He was on the cover because you know,
he's making a comeback.

1145
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:50,840
Yep.
Yo.

1146
00:49:50,860 --> 00:49:51,100
Fuck

1147
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:56,100
that.
And then backed off and watch what 

1148
00:49:56,100 --> 00:49:56,100
happens next.
You see if there's a recession,

1149
00:49:56,100 --> 00:49:59,030
so that if they charged 3:50
without David Gilmore,

1150
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:02,310
that's going to be a $500 ticket 
Gilmore,

1151
00:50:02,311 --> 00:50:03,860
and let's see if there's a recession for
them.

1152
00:50:04,220 --> 00:50:05,420
DNC,
about that record.

1153
00:50:05,421 --> 00:50:08,790
Sales of the recession.
There's no recession for good.

1154
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:13,190
That's 30 years,
but war was a masterpiece 30 fucking one

1155
00:50:13,191 --> 00:50:18,191
years ago.
It's like doing your rack 31 years and 

1156
00:50:18,191 --> 00:50:18,191
never writing a joke.
Well,

1157
00:50:18,191 --> 00:50:18,650
they hit,
they hit a high.

1158
00:50:18,651 --> 00:50:21,470
That is almost like a level of 
perfection.

1159
00:50:21,471 --> 00:50:24,290
Perfection like that song time.
Perfect Shit.

1160
00:50:24,310 --> 00:50:29,310
It was just on and on my way up here.
Take the makeup in the world.

1161
00:50:32,210 --> 00:50:33,740
It's about the four people live in the 
world.

1162
00:50:33,741 --> 00:50:35,930
Sheep,
pigs and fucking bugs.

1163
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:37,490
That's it.
That's what we are.

1164
00:50:37,491 --> 00:50:40,130
Sheep,
the pigs or the politician and the dogs.

1165
00:50:40,140 --> 00:50:45,140
The motherfucker that sling Dick,
the rest of them are fucking sheet and 

1166
00:50:45,140 --> 00:50:45,300
they got three types of sheep.
And that's the name.

1167
00:50:45,350 --> 00:50:50,350
That's what the album is about.
It's three types of sheep for fucking 

1168
00:50:50,350 --> 00:50:51,440
sheet.
People think everything's cool and oh,

1169
00:50:51,441 --> 00:50:52,940
Lou Reed,
three types.

1170
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:56,800
One of these done.
Uh,

1171
00:50:56,810 --> 00:50:58,310
I did that walk on the wild side 
already,

1172
00:50:58,311 --> 00:51:02,480
five fucking yellow and Lou Reed is good
for pretending your pool if you like,

1173
00:51:02,481 --> 00:51:05,470
literally a cool Blue Ridge and Inga 
Rafa law,

1174
00:51:05,620 --> 00:51:07,760
you know cousins?
Yeah,

1175
00:51:07,780 --> 00:51:12,780
he lives in the East village man.
Walked round with a leather jacket or a 

1176
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:16,240
leather jacket and smokes camels 30 
fucking years.

1177
00:51:16,310 --> 00:51:17,900
And I'll tell you what,
that one song is,

1178
00:51:17,901 --> 00:51:20,060
walk on the wild side a bad.
You know what?

1179
00:51:20,061 --> 00:51:25,061
But tomorrow when I leave here tonight,
I want you to go on youtube and just 

1180
00:51:25,061 --> 00:51:28,271
press Lou Reed knows it and I want you 
to hit three songs with Lou Reed and 

1181
00:51:28,271 --> 00:51:32,081
call me.
Somebody tried to convince me that iggy 

1182
00:51:32,081 --> 00:51:34,601
pop was really good.
You got to listen to achy problems with 

1183
00:51:34,601 --> 00:51:35,160
the stooges and he plays.
He sends me this link.

1184
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:38,740
So I go and click on this link and 
listen to this fucking song.

1185
00:51:38,780 --> 00:51:41,030
I'm like,
this is so uncoordinated.

1186
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:46,360
It's all over the place.
I mean maybe if you were a big ass iggy 

1187
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:47,630
pop fan already,
maybe if you liked it already and he got

1188
00:51:47,631 --> 00:51:52,631
into this style of.
But then I get that way about like some 

1189
00:51:52,631 --> 00:51:53,390
music that people go nuts for like the 
dead.

1190
00:51:53,391 --> 00:51:54,860
I don't understand the data.
It doesn't.

1191
00:51:55,010 --> 00:51:56,840
A few of their songs are I think are 
really good,

1192
00:51:56,841 --> 00:52:01,841
but a lot of it just doesn't ring with 
me and I think it's like a frequency 

1193
00:52:01,841 --> 00:52:02,690
that I'm just not tuned into that other 
people are.

1194
00:52:02,780 --> 00:52:06,170
I went to see him and they run with me 
until I smelled those motherfuckers,

1195
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:09,020
the smell of those filthy fucking 
animals.

1196
00:52:09,730 --> 00:52:14,730
And I looked in boulder,
which collaborate those they were 

1197
00:52:14,730 --> 00:52:18,230
everywhere when I left being an army 
brat and hair and asked like some people

1198
00:52:18,231 --> 00:52:19,740
just don't want to pay.

1199
00:52:20,550 --> 00:52:24,620
But the deadheads it was like ass and 
feet and fucking Brett and ears.

1200
00:52:24,830 --> 00:52:27,440
Who has stinky fucking is besides the 
German shepherd.

1201
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:29,710
Those fucking dead heads.
I think he is.

1202
00:52:29,910 --> 00:52:32,120
I want to see the data you smell in 
there.

1203
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:37,680
I've been with.
Next time you had a concert at red 

1204
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:40,181
rocks.
I went to see the dead Santana and 

1205
00:52:40,181 --> 00:52:40,181
public enemy.
Oh God.

1206
00:52:40,181 --> 00:52:45,180
That was scheduled dead Santana and 
public enemy of black people with guns 

1207
00:52:46,251 --> 00:52:51,251
and a bunch of stinky people with no 
fucking soap and somebody actually shot 

1208
00:52:51,251 --> 00:52:52,940
a gun at the fucking constantly.
Benefits were crazy.

1209
00:52:52,950 --> 00:52:57,950
Holy Santana came on and did a black 
magic woman dog and it was little off 

1210
00:52:57,980 --> 00:52:59,170
even that.
Even that.

1211
00:52:59,270 --> 00:53:04,270
Listen to the abraxis.
Get yourself the first or the second 

1212
00:53:04,270 --> 00:53:05,000
Santana job.
Listen to that brilliance.

1213
00:53:05,001 --> 00:53:10,001
This fucking Mexican kid cook took a 
guitar and trying to fucking rock music 

1214
00:53:10,430 --> 00:53:14,090
and he mixed it with Spanish music and 
those first two albums are brilliant.

1215
00:53:14,090 --> 00:53:19,090
Oh yeah,
go bovine fucking black magic woman is 

1216
00:53:19,090 --> 00:53:22,011
what the fuck happened.
That one dude that made that really 

1217
00:53:22,011 --> 00:53:23,630
successful song with him recently,
like within the last 10 years,

1218
00:53:24,420 --> 00:53:29,420
just the underdog or what is that song?
That's Rob Thomas from matchbox 20 where

1219
00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:34,560
what happened to the fucking sing a 
great fucking writer.

1220
00:53:34,710 --> 00:53:38,520
I mean that dude is bad.
That dude made all those songs,

1221
00:53:38,521 --> 00:53:42,810
wrote songs for a bunch of people and I 
think matchbox broke up and then he went

1222
00:53:42,811 --> 00:53:45,570
and did that song with Santana.
I think matchbox put another house.

1223
00:53:46,170 --> 00:53:48,720
He put a pretty nice.
It wasn't a bad single lab,

1224
00:53:49,140 --> 00:53:49,830
you know that song,

1225
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:52,260
that song was Santana?
No,

1226
00:53:54,790 --> 00:53:59,790
goddamn.
It's one of those songs where it's like 

1227
00:53:59,790 --> 00:54:00,390
the perfect harmony of his voice and 
Santana and [inaudible].

1228
00:54:00,460 --> 00:54:05,460
Santana was one of those dudes that he 
put out a Santana song and I had to 

1229
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:06,140
figure this out when I was a kid and I 
was like,

1230
00:54:06,141 --> 00:54:07,520
wait,
this is a different dude singing.

1231
00:54:07,521 --> 00:54:09,080
Every time it was like,
I don't get it,

1232
00:54:09,140 --> 00:54:10,900
and then I realized,
oh,

1233
00:54:10,910 --> 00:54:13,220
it's not even a bad.
He's such a bad motherfucker.

1234
00:54:13,221 --> 00:54:16,610
It's not even about the singer.
It's about the guitarist.

1235
00:54:16,790 --> 00:54:21,790
It said one dude Carlos Santana,
his shit is so tight and so bad ass that

1236
00:54:22,491 --> 00:54:24,110
who had no matter who the fuck is saying
it.

1237
00:54:24,111 --> 00:54:29,111
Yeah,
it's a Santana Song pitch you this the 

1238
00:54:29,111 --> 00:54:31,660
vocals and the song itself almost plays 
second fiddle to that God damn guitar.

1239
00:54:32,330 --> 00:54:37,330
Now what a amazing dude that guy is 
because who the fuck else can claim 

1240
00:54:37,330 --> 00:54:37,330
that?
There's like.

1241
00:54:37,330 --> 00:54:38,900
I guess there's a few other guys that do
that,

1242
00:54:38,901 --> 00:54:40,160
like,
like

1243
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:44,210
be like a black wall was a back.
What's his name?

1244
00:54:44,580 --> 00:54:45,360
Dave?
Well,

1245
00:54:46,140 --> 00:54:49,240
they forget to fucking Jeff.
Jeff,

1246
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:50,100
Jeff Beck.

1247
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:55,200
Jeff Beck was another guitarist who can 
put out songs that weren't really Jeff 

1248
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:55,420
Beck.
I mean it was,

1249
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:58,200
it was called a Jeff Beck Song,
but it was just because of his.

1250
00:54:58,660 --> 00:55:00,920
He was an egotistical motherfucking 
invaded that jam.

1251
00:55:00,921 --> 00:55:03,660
Would Rod Stewart early in the morning?
I can't sleep.

1252
00:55:03,990 --> 00:55:06,410
Remember down there.
That was a great factuation yeah,

1253
00:55:06,470 --> 00:55:11,470
it was him.
And then he canceled before the fucking 

1254
00:55:11,470 --> 00:55:14,001
tour.
Once he left Rod Stewart go out there 

1255
00:55:14,001 --> 00:55:14,001
alive without a guitar because he's an 
ego maniac.

1256
00:55:14,001 --> 00:55:18,830
Oh really?
So he didn't want to deal with being 

1257
00:55:18,830 --> 00:55:21,621
second fiddle.
The Rod Stewart Rod Stewart was too 

1258
00:55:21,621 --> 00:55:21,621
fucking strong

1259
00:55:21,621 --> 00:55:23,180
back as a Greg Guitar.
But you can't fuck with Maggie May.

1260
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:26,670
I saw Rob Stewart last night and um,
some,

1261
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:31,740
it was,
some show that was at was like an 

1262
00:55:31,740 --> 00:55:31,950
infomercial where they were advertising 
some album,

1263
00:55:32,150 --> 00:55:35,850
a series of.
It was cds and dvds with all these.

1264
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:41,360
I guess it was all dvds.
It was all musicians and comedians from 

1265
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:43,140
some midnight special show and Rod 
Stewart was one of them.

1266
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:48,160
The rocking on the rock when you were 
out there looking like a lady.

1267
00:55:50,340 --> 00:55:55,340
He looks like a ugly lady.
He's in this little skinny guy in his 

1268
00:55:55,340 --> 00:55:57,660
weird outfit and he's prancing around 
stage in this weird way,

1269
00:55:57,840 --> 00:56:02,840
but his songs are so.
God damn good there is so soulful and he

1270
00:56:03,901 --> 00:56:06,540
had some fucking songs,
man.

1271
00:56:06,690 --> 00:56:07,620
Maggie May.

1272
00:56:10,050 --> 00:56:15,050
Yeah,
he's got an album called blind 

1273
00:56:15,050 --> 00:56:16,110
infatuation was already when he was 
starting to get weird.

1274
00:56:16,111 --> 00:56:18,360
He's got an album called blondes have 
more fun.

1275
00:56:20,010 --> 00:56:21,350
Oh my God.
It's so hard.

1276
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:22,590
They called.
You're insane.

1277
00:56:22,591 --> 00:56:25,630
It is fucking bad.
I listened to her once.

1278
00:56:25,650 --> 00:56:27,790
I got to find it on Youtube.
It's in that deep.

1279
00:56:28,180 --> 00:56:29,740
But Rod Stewart,
I went to see him.

1280
00:56:29,741 --> 00:56:31,510
I never see fuck.
Van Halen.

1281
00:56:32,150 --> 00:56:35,120
I seen them bitches sucking Dick.
Wrapped the show.

1282
00:56:35,121 --> 00:56:40,121
Rob Stewart got on stage.
There was two people made you want to 

1283
00:56:40,121 --> 00:56:41,350
suck my Dick and that's rod stewart and 
Kenny Rogers and do what?

1284
00:56:41,351 --> 00:56:46,351
The white head.
What we saw as soon as that 

1285
00:56:46,351 --> 00:56:46,980
motherfuckers started singing lady,
but

1286
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:52,520
that's such a unique voice,
such unique voice like vocally and like 

1287
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:54,420
the shit that he sang about,
like the way he would sing,

1288
00:56:54,421 --> 00:56:57,540
like they will kind of vulnerable songs,
but in a weird way like,

1289
00:56:57,750 --> 00:56:59,640
like Maggie may wake up,
Maggie,

1290
00:56:59,641 --> 00:57:04,641
I think I got something to say to you.
It's late September and I really should 

1291
00:57:04,641 --> 00:57:05,230
be back in school.
Like what is this song?

1292
00:57:05,231 --> 00:57:06,090
Like,
what is it about?

1293
00:57:06,210 --> 00:57:08,010
It's like some guy was trying to find 
himself,

1294
00:57:08,190 --> 00:57:10,380
you know,
steal my daddy's q and make a living out

1295
00:57:10,381 --> 00:57:12,080
of playing pool,
you know,

1296
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:15,930
found myself or rock and roll band.
The needs a helping hand.

1297
00:57:17,610 --> 00:57:20,730
I mean like the songs were so weird and 
unusual man.

1298
00:57:21,030 --> 00:57:21,780
Like his,
his,

1299
00:57:21,781 --> 00:57:25,050
just his stylistically the things that 
he was into singing about,

1300
00:57:25,410 --> 00:57:26,100
you know,
he was a,

1301
00:57:26,130 --> 00:57:27,480
he was a bad motherfucker.

1302
00:57:27,780 --> 00:57:28,870
Really?
Meek voice.

1303
00:57:30,730 --> 00:57:34,240
Seeing your face bad.
Fuck God.

1304
00:57:34,270 --> 00:57:35,620
Damn.
That's a good song.

1305
00:57:35,740 --> 00:57:37,570
That's a song that's like,
it's still,

1306
00:57:37,571 --> 00:57:39,370
no matter where you are,
when that song comes on,

1307
00:57:39,371 --> 00:57:40,780
you're happy.
You know,

1308
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:42,600
I will stay in my car until he,

1309
00:57:42,690 --> 00:57:47,690
I'm even if I'm in a rush until he say 
steal my dad his q and make a living 

1310
00:57:47,871 --> 00:57:48,620
that,
a plan.

1311
00:57:49,510 --> 00:57:52,670
Every time you're in a car and stuff,
I just got to sit.

1312
00:57:52,740 --> 00:57:54,460
I got to sit tight.
I don't care if I'm late,

1313
00:57:54,670 --> 00:57:56,080
I'll tell you.
I'll go to your house.

1314
00:57:56,410 --> 00:57:58,210
Dude.
I would've been here five minutes ago.

1315
00:57:58,590 --> 00:58:00,710
Fucking Maggie Mae was on and I'm,
you know,

1316
00:58:00,930 --> 00:58:03,450
I got out of respect.
I got to listen to that song.

1317
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:07,590
There's a few songs is a few songs.
Call me the breeze,

1318
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:09,510
call me the breeze comes on.
She is

1319
00:58:09,610 --> 00:58:10,290
cleaner.
Sisters,

1320
00:58:10,300 --> 00:58:15,300
jump shot like vocal trouble.
I like fucking all that crazy skiddish 

1321
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:16,930
shit.
They got another one on that album.

1322
00:58:16,931 --> 00:58:19,360
I got an inside that is just so fucking 
cool.

1323
00:58:19,660 --> 00:58:24,660
You know?
I knew in high school when I was 14 

1324
00:58:24,660 --> 00:58:24,660
years old,
when jump came out,

1325
00:58:24,660 --> 00:58:28,561
van Halen jump came out.
I knew there was something wrong with 

1326
00:58:28,561 --> 00:58:31,171
using keyboards.
I knew back then like because everybody 

1327
00:58:31,171 --> 00:58:32,670
was in the van Halen,
but I was in high school.

1328
00:58:32,671 --> 00:58:34,750
Okay.
When I was in high school in 1980,

1329
00:58:34,751 --> 00:58:39,751
one was my freshman year of high school 
and my sister's boyfriend at the time 

1330
00:58:40,660 --> 00:58:45,660
was this kid.
His name was jeff and he was John.

1331
00:58:46,870 --> 00:58:47,800
Yeah,
John Jewett,

1332
00:58:47,860 --> 00:58:52,860
sorry.
And he was really into van Halen to the 

1333
00:58:52,860 --> 00:58:54,040
point where he's going to be mad at me.
Forgot his name.

1334
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:55,030
Um,
hi dog.

1335
00:58:55,480 --> 00:58:56,740
And uh,
uh,

1336
00:58:57,190 --> 00:59:02,190
he was really into van Halen to the 
point where he had it on his license 

1337
00:59:02,190 --> 00:59:03,250
plate.
His license plate was van Halen.

1338
00:59:03,251 --> 00:59:05,380
I was car and everybody was in the van 
Halen.

1339
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:08,170
And then the new van Halen came out.
It was 1984.

1340
00:59:08,171 --> 00:59:09,220
That was the album,
right?

1341
00:59:09,221 --> 00:59:10,090
Wasn't it?
With jump.

1342
00:59:10,510 --> 00:59:15,510
The new album came out,
I remember in high school and 

1343
00:59:15,510 --> 00:59:15,510
everybody's like,
oh,

1344
00:59:15,510 --> 00:59:16,090
the new van handles out.
It's awesome.

1345
00:59:16,330 --> 00:59:17,350
And I was like,
dude,

1346
00:59:17,540 --> 00:59:18,470
dude,
dude,

1347
00:59:18,650 --> 00:59:19,270
dude,
dude.

1348
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:21,340
I'm like,
what the fuck is this?

1349
00:59:21,341 --> 00:59:22,070
Love that shit.

1350
00:59:22,190 --> 00:59:26,390
I remember thinking this is lacking in 
Seoul.

1351
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:30,670
What's lacking in sold jump?
That's on jump as well.

1352
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:31,550
Job.
That song,

1353
00:59:31,670 --> 00:59:36,670
that keyboard,
that electronic keyboard manner that is 

1354
00:59:36,670 --> 00:59:38,690
not as good.
You hear running with the devil,

1355
00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:40,820
you know,
hot for teacher,

1356
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:43,160
you know those are.
Those are real songs.

1357
00:59:43,430 --> 00:59:47,300
But geometry.
What,

1358
00:59:47,390 --> 00:59:50,770
what song is being streets on?
Oh Shit.

1359
00:59:51,540 --> 00:59:56,540
Oh God damn means treats is good.
When that album came out,

1360
00:59:57,350 --> 00:59:59,630
when the boom boxes were becoming 
popular member,

1361
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:02,860
everyone had to move their shoulders,
stereo boom boxes.

1362
01:00:03,140 --> 01:00:05,780
And that song was one of the first songs
I remember hearing.

1363
01:00:05,781 --> 01:00:09,110
And just awesome stereo.
That seems so future.

1364
01:00:09,111 --> 01:00:11,890
Like eighties was like all about break 
dancing and you know,

1365
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:14,450
like the future and stuff like women and
children first.

1366
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:15,800
No,
that was the second one.

1367
01:00:15,980 --> 01:00:18,890
Really.
So it's van Halen one.

1368
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:20,530
Fair warning,
fair warning.

1369
01:00:20,750 --> 01:00:23,910
I got wanted log.

1370
01:00:23,910 --> 01:00:27,650
Strike that pool boy down.
They had some fucking jams.

1371
01:00:27,740 --> 01:00:30,290
We had some good fucking unchained.
Yeah.

1372
01:00:30,291 --> 01:00:31,910
Main streets.
Unchained.

1373
01:00:32,290 --> 01:00:37,290
Woo.
If this is love or hung out with David 

1374
01:00:37,290 --> 01:00:39,090
Lee Roth at the comedy store once 
videotaped.

1375
01:00:39,250 --> 01:00:40,490
Yeah,
he is cool.

1376
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:45,680
But we had it.
We had to not release it because he 

1377
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:45,680
talked to a lot of shit about some 
people.

1378
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:46,460
He didn't want it released.
Um,

1379
01:00:46,461 --> 01:00:47,390
but uh,
he,

1380
01:00:47,550 --> 01:00:50,080
he actually,
they contacted you right the next day,

1381
01:00:50,120 --> 01:00:52,130
the next day his,
his fellow,

1382
01:00:52,190 --> 01:00:54,400
the guy who works for him contacted 
Brian is like,

1383
01:00:54,410 --> 01:00:59,410
please,
please don't release that because David 

1384
01:00:59,410 --> 01:00:59,410
Lee Roth,
just,

1385
01:00:59,410 --> 01:00:59,410
he's just a,
a free talker.

1386
01:00:59,410 --> 01:01:00,710
He just hangs around and starts talking 
shit.

1387
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:03,680
He was talking shit about girls.
He was talking shit about,

1388
01:01:03,750 --> 01:01:08,750
you know,
people in other bands and music that 

1389
01:01:08,750 --> 01:01:08,750
sucks.
And guys who can't fucking,

1390
01:01:08,750 --> 01:01:09,860
he's like you.
And in a way,

1391
01:01:09,970 --> 01:01:11,660
Lisa,
he's got a little bit,

1392
01:01:11,661 --> 01:01:13,190
he can't carry the spread.

1393
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:15,680
He's got a little bit of that in him.
But he was funny,

1394
01:01:15,681 --> 01:01:17,000
man.
He's a funny guy.

1395
01:01:17,001 --> 01:01:22,001
He's a real guy.
He had a real band and something 

1396
01:01:22,001 --> 01:01:24,911
happened and they replaced them with 
that fake fucking Sammy Hagar been open 

1397
01:01:24,911 --> 01:01:27,970
for Sabic when they had deal.
People were spitting out of Philadelphia

1398
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:29,600
in Philadelphia.
They were rolling,

1399
01:01:29,630 --> 01:01:34,630
just spit off their fingers.
They call it like whatever they do when 

1400
01:01:34,630 --> 01:01:37,421
they throw it at you.
And I remember watching fucking singer 

1401
01:01:37,421 --> 01:01:40,870
and spit flying by and he's trying to 
duck and shit.

1402
01:01:41,010 --> 01:01:42,720
It was like,
I always did.

1403
01:01:42,721 --> 01:01:47,721
Did you,
did you like David Lee Roth when he did 

1404
01:01:47,721 --> 01:01:47,721
his own solar stuff?
No.

1405
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:53,280
No.
David Lee Roth needed Eddie van Halen 

1406
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:53,330
and Eddie van Halen needed.
Look,

1407
01:01:53,420 --> 01:01:54,250
man,
the.

1408
01:01:54,360 --> 01:01:56,960
It's,
it's not just one person man.

1409
01:01:56,961 --> 01:02:01,961
It's fucking teams.
It's the creative juices of everybody 

1410
01:02:01,961 --> 01:02:03,050
together.
That's the really interesting shit.

1411
01:02:03,230 --> 01:02:08,230
It's just hard to get that to work 
because you got egos and then he got 

1412
01:02:08,230 --> 01:02:11,321
Valerie Bertinelli who most likely 
probably wanted to fuck David Lee Roth 

1413
01:02:11,321 --> 01:02:15,610
but couldn't get them and got Eddie van 
Halen instead and then shit got weird 

1414
01:02:15,610 --> 01:02:16,730
and she was like,
why do you keep them around?

1415
01:02:16,731 --> 01:02:18,840
He's such an Egomaniac,
you know,

1416
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:20,010
because she really wanted to fuck

1417
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:21,690
David Lee Roth.
At least that's what I would assume.

1418
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:25,710
But David Lee Roth was cool as fuck man.
He was one of the first guys that like,

1419
01:02:26,010 --> 01:02:29,520
I came up to me after the show and I was
actually nervous.

1420
01:02:29,521 --> 01:02:32,310
I was nervous to talk to the ugly raw 
and when he was telling me I was funny,

1421
01:02:32,430 --> 01:02:33,180
you know,
like dude,

1422
01:02:33,181 --> 01:02:34,590
I fucking loved it.
That was great.

1423
01:02:34,650 --> 01:02:35,850
It was like,
I had no idea.

1424
01:02:35,851 --> 01:02:37,230
I thought you were just that fear factor
guy.

1425
01:02:37,231 --> 01:02:38,430
You're a fucking liar.
I'm like,

1426
01:02:38,431 --> 01:02:40,500
Holy Shit.
I'm talking to David Lee Roth,

1427
01:02:40,740 --> 01:02:45,740
like for me,
going back to Newton south high school 

1428
01:02:45,740 --> 01:02:45,740
in 1983,
you know,

1429
01:02:45,740 --> 01:02:45,740
listening to the,
you know,

1430
01:02:45,740 --> 01:02:50,421
sitting out in the courtyard with 
everybody listening on the cassette 

1431
01:02:50,421 --> 01:02:50,421
player,
listening to fucking Van Halen,

1432
01:02:50,421 --> 01:02:51,570
and then all of a sudden I'm sitting 
here,

1433
01:02:51,630 --> 01:02:56,630
just me and Eddie Bravo and Brian and 
we're hanging out in front of the 

1434
01:02:56,630 --> 01:02:56,940
Goddamn comedy store.

1435
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:02,000
There's no one even surrounding them.
There's no moms of people were just 

1436
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:05,151
hanging out.
He just showed up unannounced on like 

1437
01:03:05,151 --> 01:03:05,850
some random Tuesday or Wednesday or 
something like that.

1438
01:03:05,940 --> 01:03:08,490
Hung out in the back of the,
paid for his fucking ticket,

1439
01:03:08,580 --> 01:03:13,580
hung out in the back of the club like a 
normal person and then came out to give 

1440
01:03:13,580 --> 01:03:15,660
me props and I'm sitting there talking 
to David Lee Roth and I'm shell shocked.

1441
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:16,650
I'm like,
I'm talking.

1442
01:03:16,651 --> 01:03:21,651
I'm like,
I can't even believe I'm talking to 

1443
01:03:21,651 --> 01:03:21,651
David Lee Roth and we're talking about 
my comedy.

1444
01:03:21,651 --> 01:03:23,070
I'm talking to David Lee Roth,
but how much he liked my set.

1445
01:03:23,071 --> 01:03:23,520
I'm like,
wow,

1446
01:03:23,521 --> 01:03:25,980
this is crazy.
This is bizarre.

1447
01:03:26,350 --> 01:03:28,300
And he was just a UCP,
but the store,

1448
01:03:29,160 --> 01:03:30,950
they're not looking for attention.
Yeah.

1449
01:03:31,190 --> 01:03:33,420
When you see somebody who's not looking 
for attention,

1450
01:03:33,421 --> 01:03:36,650
like I seen Chris Cornell at the store 
would not go Wednesday night.

1451
01:03:36,690 --> 01:03:41,350
I kept looking around this motherfucker.
I seen Dr Dre there a couple of times.

1452
01:03:42,220 --> 01:03:43,350
A couple times.
Yeah,

1453
01:03:43,380 --> 01:03:48,380
I slipped up.
We were there one night when he came in 

1454
01:03:48,380 --> 01:03:50,511
with that chick black Michelle a go.
That's the one who was married to.

1455
01:03:51,541 --> 01:03:52,440
Right.
He was married to him,

1456
01:03:52,441 --> 01:03:57,441
but he came and not dating her,
but he came in with her like they were 

1457
01:03:57,441 --> 01:03:57,840
out in the night and they all went up to
see Eddie Griffin.

1458
01:03:58,440 --> 01:04:01,980
I can't remember what her name was.
A cute little chick with black kid.

1459
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:07,160
Just got a reality show now with all 
black sisters really kind of looked the 

1460
01:04:07,160 --> 01:04:09,240
same.
I got to think of her name.

1461
01:04:09,300 --> 01:04:10,680
She's a comic.
No,

1462
01:04:10,690 --> 01:04:11,100
no,
no.

1463
01:04:11,101 --> 01:04:13,180
She's a big time.
Big Time.

1464
01:04:13,181 --> 01:04:14,890
Second time black.
Okay.

1465
01:04:15,210 --> 01:04:16,170
Well,
I don't know who that would be,

1466
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:19,320
but the comedy store was famous for that
because the comedy store,

1467
01:04:19,321 --> 01:04:20,820
even though it's run by retards,
it's,

1468
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:23,490
it's a god Damn Hollywood landmark.

1469
01:04:23,510 --> 01:04:24,570
I mean,
that's spot.

1470
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:27,080
First of all,
I would always be bad.

1471
01:04:27,420 --> 01:04:31,130
Just completely baffled that here.
I mean this is no recession going on and

1472
01:04:31,131 --> 01:04:32,040
this is,
you know,

1473
01:04:32,310 --> 01:04:34,470
the Hay Day of the,
you know,

1474
01:04:34,471 --> 01:04:39,471
the nineties and the early two thousands
and it's across the street from the 

1475
01:04:39,471 --> 01:04:41,010
House of Blues and yet on a Friday 
night,

1476
01:04:41,011 --> 01:04:44,280
there's nobody there on a Friday night.
There's fucking 50 people in the car.

1477
01:04:44,330 --> 01:04:45,540
Like,
this is criminal.

1478
01:04:45,660 --> 01:04:49,050
You guys have the greatest spot on the 
planet earth.

1479
01:04:49,410 --> 01:04:53,310
Not only does it have the greatest name 
and the history of comedy,

1480
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:58,400
not only is it a place where Richard 
Pryor film live at the fucking sunset 

1481
01:04:58,400 --> 01:04:58,400
strip,
I mean,

1482
01:04:58,400 --> 01:04:58,400
this is,
uh,

1483
01:04:58,400 --> 01:05:03,150
an amazing place in history and yet 
there's 50 people there on a Friday 

1484
01:05:03,150 --> 01:05:03,150
night.
Like,

1485
01:05:03,150 --> 01:05:07,611
that's so fucked up it was.
But it's such a Hollywood icon that 

1486
01:05:07,611 --> 01:05:10,710
people are always going to gravitate to 
that spot just to peek in,

1487
01:05:10,860 --> 01:05:11,490
you know,
it's like,

1488
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:16,760
it's what it is,
is basically las version of the comedy 

1489
01:05:16,760 --> 01:05:17,410
cellar,
except it's not as good.

1490
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:22,680
It's not run the same way.
It's not as like the comedy cellar in 

1491
01:05:22,680 --> 01:05:24,300
New York is where all the top guys go 
and fuck around and workout.

1492
01:05:24,340 --> 01:05:27,000
It's known and it's kind of like a 
restaurant attached to it.

1493
01:05:27,010 --> 01:05:28,960
People eat there and shit.
And you know,

1494
01:05:28,990 --> 01:05:32,230
Jimmy Norton Rose wrote his fucking road
is booked there.

1495
01:05:32,360 --> 01:05:34,900
He brings a laptop and dudes are always 
hanging out there.

1496
01:05:34,990 --> 01:05:36,070
So it's,
it's a real,

1497
01:05:36,071 --> 01:05:40,870
like a place where all the comics come.
But in la,

1498
01:05:40,890 --> 01:05:42,940
the comedy stores,
the closest thing you know,

1499
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:48,000
it was like the closest icon place.
I mean the Improv is the best club in 

1500
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:49,200
town,
but the comedy store has the best name.

1501
01:05:49,210 --> 01:05:52,390
It's get the best feel to get the best 
location,

1502
01:05:52,420 --> 01:05:54,820
you know,
even to the Long Beach Laugh factory.

1503
01:05:55,180 --> 01:05:58,230
That's was fucking awesome.
It wasn't really great.

1504
01:05:58,231 --> 01:06:02,080
Location is a really,
really nice.

1505
01:06:02,170 --> 01:06:03,130
What is the deal with that?

1506
01:06:03,550 --> 01:06:05,200
Can you go if you're not friends with Jo
Koy?

1507
01:06:06,760 --> 01:06:07,870
Nobody has.
No.

1508
01:06:07,871 --> 01:06:09,730
Uh,
oh,

1509
01:06:09,731 --> 01:06:11,830
that's right.
He left a job,

1510
01:06:12,070 --> 01:06:14,140
but he used to keep all the other 
Filipinos out.

1511
01:06:14,141 --> 01:06:15,170
Right.
Oh,

1512
01:06:15,430 --> 01:06:20,430
the Asians.
He didn't want anybody making any Asian 

1513
01:06:20,430 --> 01:06:20,430
jokes and he would work.
He wanted only,

1514
01:06:20,430 --> 01:06:23,480
only his Filipino jokes.
Did you watch the,

1515
01:06:24,120 --> 01:06:26,210
didn't it?
Louis show with Louis Ck.

1516
01:06:26,840 --> 01:06:30,040
I watched it on a line.
I've watched that segment.

1517
01:06:30,070 --> 01:06:32,680
It was more than one segment with Louis.
There was Dane Cook.

1518
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:34,770
It starts off with Jim Martin.
Yeah.

1519
01:06:34,930 --> 01:06:36,790
Yeah.
I watched it is interesting.

1520
01:06:36,810 --> 01:06:40,480
It was like there's a little bit of 
revisionist history there.

1521
01:06:40,560 --> 01:06:42,370
You know,
I think it was unscripted.

1522
01:06:42,371 --> 01:06:44,890
It almost seemed like real,
like it almost seemed like they actually

1523
01:06:44,891 --> 01:06:47,200
just sat down or like,
I think they worked it out.

1524
01:06:47,201 --> 01:06:49,180
I worked out the beats and then they,
they did it,

1525
01:06:49,210 --> 01:06:51,430
but I didn't like the arch I did.

1526
01:06:51,580 --> 01:06:53,320
I thought Danes argument was kind of 
silly.

1527
01:06:53,350 --> 01:06:58,350
Like why didn't you stick up for me?
Like why didn't you didn't say that I 

1528
01:06:58,350 --> 01:06:59,100
didn't steal from you,
like,

1529
01:06:59,101 --> 01:07:00,370
you know,
like I've never stolen.

1530
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:02,230
Why would I steal a joke?
I never told a joke ever.

1531
01:07:02,260 --> 01:07:04,360
Like the argument was like really 
strange,

1532
01:07:04,590 --> 01:07:06,040
you know?
Yeah.

1533
01:07:06,070 --> 01:07:09,580
I guess if you really think Dane Cook 
was guilty,

1534
01:07:09,640 --> 01:07:11,590
then yeah,
there was one of the jokes.

1535
01:07:11,591 --> 01:07:16,591
I don't know if Dane Cook was guilty,
but I do know he saw Louis Ck do those 

1536
01:07:16,591 --> 01:07:16,840
jokes before he did them and that's 
enough.

1537
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:21,960
That's all it is.
All three of them are on the same seat 

1538
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:24,600
and Louis did those in front of him and 
he did it in front of everybody he did 

1539
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:24,600
in front of all of us.
It's not.

1540
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:28,180
Look Louis Ck is the most prolific guy 
working today.

1541
01:07:28,300 --> 01:07:32,620
He puts out a new hour every year,
but back then he didn't.

1542
01:07:32,920 --> 01:07:37,360
Back then Louis was doing the same act 
for a long fucking time.

1543
01:07:37,540 --> 01:07:42,540
So those bits.
The bit about the guy getting hit by a 

1544
01:07:42,540 --> 01:07:43,220
car.
He did that bit for years.

1545
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:46,990
She did it before the dude about a guy 
getting hit by a car.

1546
01:07:47,140 --> 01:07:48,110
Steve Martin?
No,

1547
01:07:48,120 --> 01:07:48,290
no,
no.

1548
01:07:48,520 --> 01:07:52,120
Steve Martin did the naming the child 
naming the child a crazy name.

1549
01:07:52,121 --> 01:07:54,020
I thought he got the wrong bit.
Really?

1550
01:07:54,050 --> 01:07:55,910
Yeah,
I thought I hit by a car too,

1551
01:07:56,050 --> 01:08:01,050
about what you're trying to say 
something to them really well or 

1552
01:08:01,050 --> 01:08:01,390
something like that.
Really.

1553
01:08:01,391 --> 01:08:06,391
I think you're wrong,
but I'm pretty sure I'm pretty sure 

1554
01:08:06,391 --> 01:08:10,051
you're wrong.
I'm pretty sure the Steve Martin joke 

1555
01:08:10,051 --> 01:08:10,051
that,
that,

1556
01:08:10,051 --> 01:08:11,420
and this is true that Steve Martin came 
up with a um,

1557
01:08:11,600 --> 01:08:16,600
a bit that's really similar to both 
Danes bit and Louis Ck is bid that if I 

1558
01:08:17,001 --> 01:08:18,860
have a kid I'm going to name them some 
crazy name.

1559
01:08:18,860 --> 01:08:20,390
It's unpronounceable,
you know,

1560
01:08:20,480 --> 01:08:22,630
this is being silly.
Like that's not,

1561
01:08:22,690 --> 01:08:24,440
that's not stealing.
I mean,

1562
01:08:24,890 --> 01:08:28,220
I mean obviously those guys,
you know,

1563
01:08:28,410 --> 01:08:33,410
it's kind of stealing.
Look if those guys had heard Steve 

1564
01:08:33,410 --> 01:08:34,910
Martin and forgot about it and then 
reintroduce the joke,

1565
01:08:35,080 --> 01:08:40,080
you know,
like I didn't realize that they had a 

1566
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:40,940
like,
like just forgotten it,

1567
01:08:41,390 --> 01:08:44,300
but you've got to stop doing it once you
hear it about Steve Martin's bit.

1568
01:08:44,510 --> 01:08:48,080
But the difference is Louis was doing it
in front of Dane.

1569
01:08:48,650 --> 01:08:52,080
So whether or not Dane is a joke thief 
that,

1570
01:08:52,100 --> 01:08:52,970
you know,
look,

1571
01:08:52,971 --> 01:08:55,070
I liked Dane.
I think he's a talented guy.

1572
01:08:55,071 --> 01:08:57,740
I think he's a great marketer and I 
think he's a good person.

1573
01:08:57,741 --> 01:09:01,040
I really do.
But I also think he's wildly ambitious,

1574
01:09:01,480 --> 01:09:06,480
you know,
and I think that sometimes when you're 

1575
01:09:06,480 --> 01:09:08,090
wildly ambitious you don't even realize 
what you're doing and you're doing it.

1576
01:09:08,090 --> 01:09:13,090
You don't mean to do it,
but you start doing it and those bits 

1577
01:09:13,090 --> 01:09:14,000
work and then you don't want to let them
go.

1578
01:09:14,300 --> 01:09:15,800
And even though someone's like,
hey man,

1579
01:09:15,801 --> 01:09:20,801
that sounds like Joe Diaz was bit.
You don't want to let them go because 

1580
01:09:20,801 --> 01:09:22,430
they are weapons and you use them and 
use them to get what you want,

1581
01:09:22,431 --> 01:09:24,830
which is you want love,
you want that love and adulation.

1582
01:09:24,831 --> 01:09:29,831
You want to be killing up there and you 
get addicted to it and you can't let it 

1583
01:09:29,831 --> 01:09:29,831
go.
And if he's addicted to,

1584
01:09:29,831 --> 01:09:31,130
if he's guilty of anything,
he's guilty of that.

1585
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:33,950
So that's why I thought it was the 
argument was weird.

1586
01:09:33,951 --> 01:09:34,370
I was like,
man,

1587
01:09:34,371 --> 01:09:35,750
you guys are like,
you know,

1588
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:39,380
it's weird.
But I liked how Louis such a good dude,

1589
01:09:39,381 --> 01:09:40,090
man,
you know,

1590
01:09:40,091 --> 01:09:45,091
like even his whole way he's approaching
it like I didn't like what people were 

1591
01:09:45,091 --> 01:09:46,580
saying about you and I didn't like that 
people were getting mad at you.

1592
01:09:46,770 --> 01:09:47,540
And I was like,
wow.

1593
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:48,530
Like he's,
he's just,

1594
01:09:48,531 --> 01:09:49,520
uh,
you know,

1595
01:09:49,521 --> 01:09:53,500
one of the reasons why he's doing so 
well is that he's his,

1596
01:09:53,501 --> 01:09:58,501
his,
like the way he thinks is a good way to 

1597
01:09:58,501 --> 01:09:58,501
think he's a good guy.
Yeah.

1598
01:09:58,501 --> 01:10:02,840
He sticks to his fucking.
He's not like these other folks that we 

1599
01:10:02,840 --> 01:10:04,930
have around 24 fucking hours a day that 
I've seen Louis.

1600
01:10:04,931 --> 01:10:09,931
He came up to me with the comedy store.
I used to host on Sunday nights and he 

1601
01:10:09,931 --> 01:10:10,640
would come up and do a set every night.
Very polite.

1602
01:10:11,130 --> 01:10:12,320
One night he came up to me,
he goes,

1603
01:10:12,321 --> 01:10:13,550
are you available next week,
Bro?

1604
01:10:13,551 --> 01:10:15,360
And I go,
yeah.

1605
01:10:15,361 --> 01:10:16,850
And he goes,
I'm going to put them on,

1606
01:10:16,940 --> 01:10:19,980
put you on my show.
He took my name and number or like,

1607
01:10:20,350 --> 01:10:25,350
whatnot,
not good at grammar coke and never 

1608
01:10:25,350 --> 01:10:25,350
thought anything of it.
Later he called me.

1609
01:10:25,350 --> 01:10:26,810
He paid me more than anybody else has 
ever paid me,

1610
01:10:27,230 --> 01:10:29,390
and he took care of me.
They had me there for the weekend.

1611
01:10:29,420 --> 01:10:32,870
He came with his word.
So because of that I give him my loyalty

1612
01:10:32,871 --> 01:10:35,210
forever because he's one of the few of 
the.

1613
01:10:35,211 --> 01:10:37,650
All of these fucking weak motherfuckers 
we got around this.

1614
01:10:37,880 --> 01:10:39,910
That sticks to his fucking word.
He's a real.

1615
01:10:39,950 --> 01:10:44,950
His real not give them props.
I don't give them none of these fucking 

1616
01:10:44,950 --> 01:10:48,310
Beasley motherfucking prompts,
but Louis deserves my heart because he 

1617
01:10:48,310 --> 01:10:50,660
put me on television without every 
expecting anything from me.

1618
01:10:50,990 --> 01:10:52,790
And he just told me he was like put me 
on.

1619
01:10:53,020 --> 01:10:56,190
Two days later they called and I respect
that to the.

1620
01:10:56,450 --> 01:11:01,450
Especially like I said,
with these fucking much we have around 

1621
01:11:01,450 --> 01:11:04,401
us as a comedian.
He's the most inspirational guy to me 

1622
01:11:04,401 --> 01:11:06,140
and I think to everybody because he's 
the most prolific,

1623
01:11:06,260 --> 01:11:09,650
like you can argue over who makes you 
laugh the most because I always say,

1624
01:11:09,651 --> 01:11:12,170
you make me laugh the most.
You're you're favorite guy to watch.

1625
01:11:12,250 --> 01:11:13,830
You know,
and I think there's,

1626
01:11:13,900 --> 01:11:18,900
there's some moments.
The moment when we were hanging out at 

1627
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:21,771
the Improv and you're on stage,
we were doing the weekend there and you 

1628
01:11:21,771 --> 01:11:23,040
did that fucking bit about about dead 
Dick,

1629
01:11:23,290 --> 01:11:27,120
about you don't accept dead Dick and 
you've made it up on the fly.

1630
01:11:27,300 --> 01:11:29,820
He goes,
you take two popsicle sticks and you tie

1631
01:11:29,821 --> 01:11:30,730
that pick up and

1632
01:11:31,250 --> 01:11:34,420
back in like a wounded soldier and when 
you sit,

1633
01:11:35,470 --> 01:11:36,050
when you say,

1634
01:11:36,590 --> 01:11:37,840
when you said it,
you,

1635
01:11:37,850 --> 01:11:42,850
you,
I knew you ad libbed it because I know 

1636
01:11:42,850 --> 01:11:44,931
you're,
I know you're act by heart and you knew 

1637
01:11:44,931 --> 01:11:47,330
you had lived it and it fucking destroy 
you or beat red in the face laughing at 

1638
01:11:47,781 --> 01:11:52,781
your own shit,
but you want me to do and me and ran 

1639
01:11:52,781 --> 01:11:52,781
should fear in the back of the room and 
we just go.

1640
01:11:52,781 --> 01:11:53,720
He's the best.
He's the best.

1641
01:11:53,900 --> 01:11:57,980
Nobody makes me laugh harder than you,
but Louis Ck is more prolific.

1642
01:11:57,981 --> 01:11:59,030
He's the most prolific,

1643
01:11:59,180 --> 01:12:04,180
cool conversations about standing up 
with Louis or my act and my life has 

1644
01:12:04,180 --> 01:12:04,340
changed.
I'm telling you this right off the bat,

1645
01:12:04,440 --> 01:12:05,760
I believe it.
I had to.

1646
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:11,000
I think he's changing the way a lot of 
comics do it and he's making guys write 

1647
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:15,321
more.
What was the conversation that you had 

1648
01:12:15,321 --> 01:12:17,451
with them?
I had a conversation about storytelling 

1649
01:12:17,451 --> 01:12:18,780
and about jokes and he said that he had 
watched me and that,

1650
01:12:18,781 --> 01:12:21,690
uh,
the material was a little fucking crazy,

1651
01:12:21,720 --> 01:12:23,160
but he loved that.
He respected it,

1652
01:12:23,510 --> 01:12:25,890
but he goes,
you have so much more to tell people.

1653
01:12:25,950 --> 01:12:29,250
He goes,
I want you to talk about what is dark to

1654
01:12:29,251 --> 01:12:34,251
you.
That's why I started talking about 

1655
01:12:34,251 --> 01:12:35,871
mugging the hooker.
That's why I started talking about all 

1656
01:12:35,871 --> 01:12:36,990
the crimes I had done outline and that's
why I'm writing them on stage.

1657
01:12:36,991 --> 01:12:39,030
Now you know what you need to talk about
onstage,

1658
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:44,120
what brother you need to talk about 
finding your dead mother when you were 

1659
01:12:44,120 --> 01:12:44,120
high on acid.

1660
01:12:44,120 --> 01:12:45,980
How fucking craziest you gotta.
Tell them about that onstage,

1661
01:12:46,020 --> 01:12:46,950
bro.
That is.

1662
01:12:47,010 --> 01:12:49,490
But that's a show stopper.
I know Joe.

1663
01:12:49,530 --> 01:12:53,010
I got nowhere to go after you find your 
dead mother on the floor.

1664
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:55,500
Jesus can't follow you.
Jesus can't.

1665
01:12:55,501 --> 01:12:56,550
Fuck.
I tried it already.

1666
01:12:56,870 --> 01:12:58,710
You could end with it or you could end 
with it.

1667
01:12:58,711 --> 01:13:00,130
And what about the rest of the fucking 
show?

1668
01:13:00,180 --> 01:13:04,950
I got to let him eat in 20 minutes.
So bad,

1669
01:13:05,560 --> 01:13:07,050
you know,
it's like going up to somebody going,

1670
01:13:07,051 --> 01:13:08,550
hey bro,
how you doing it here?

1671
01:13:08,551 --> 01:13:09,900
We go up to somebody like by mistake and
go,

1672
01:13:09,901 --> 01:13:10,620
hey bro,
how you doing?

1673
01:13:10,830 --> 01:13:12,990
How's your brother?
He just died.

1674
01:13:13,050 --> 01:13:13,750
Yeah.
Boom.

1675
01:13:13,820 --> 01:13:17,340
Do you feel at a comedy?
Show it a one man show setting.

1676
01:13:17,341 --> 01:13:20,220
I could do it,
but at the comedy show I cannot do it.

1677
01:13:21,240 --> 01:13:23,490
It's too hard to recover from it.
What does that mean?

1678
01:13:24,050 --> 01:13:29,050
He just tried to change this act over 
the weekend and Ontario and Katt 

1679
01:13:29,050 --> 01:13:29,540
Williams.
Tell me what happened.

1680
01:13:29,620 --> 01:13:30,660
Uh,
he,

1681
01:13:30,670 --> 01:13:35,670
uh,
tried to do something different 

1682
01:13:35,670 --> 01:13:35,670
supposedly like he tried to do more of a
serious,

1683
01:13:35,670 --> 01:13:39,330
uh,
kind of like one man shows where 

1684
01:13:39,330 --> 01:13:40,250
California Improv Improv.
Yeah.

1685
01:13:40,251 --> 01:13:42,290
And then the audience,
which I knew he was there,

1686
01:13:42,291 --> 01:13:44,600
I wouldn't want to see him.
They wasn't having it.

1687
01:13:44,690 --> 01:13:49,690
And so they started like,
I guess booing or doing something like 

1688
01:13:49,690 --> 01:13:52,511
that.
And then a cat starts screaming at him 

1689
01:13:52,511 --> 01:13:52,511
or doing something.
And then the Ontario Improv.

1690
01:13:52,511 --> 01:13:52,970
So this is,
by the way,

1691
01:13:52,971 --> 01:13:57,971
all based off tmz a interior.
I've kicked them off stage and kicked 

1692
01:13:57,971 --> 01:14:02,951
them out of the building and then he 
wouldn't leave and so then they called 

1693
01:14:02,951 --> 01:14:05,771
the police and the police had to take 
them off the premises and they canceled 

1694
01:14:05,771 --> 01:14:05,771
the whole weekend.

1695
01:14:05,771 --> 01:14:09,270
Well he's definitely crazy because he 
keeps getting arrested and there's a lot

1696
01:14:09,271 --> 01:14:14,271
of shit going on with him.
He got caught with guns a couple times 

1697
01:14:14,271 --> 01:14:15,580
and.
But he did a show recently in New Mexico

1698
01:14:15,700 --> 01:14:18,600
and a bunch of people wanted their money
back because he got on stage,

1699
01:14:18,601 --> 01:14:19,870
it shows a 9:00
show.

1700
01:14:19,871 --> 01:14:23,380
He didn't get on stage to like midnight 
and he goes on stage,

1701
01:14:23,410 --> 01:14:27,010
the music stays on while he's on stage 
and we use it stays on and he's,

1702
01:14:27,100 --> 01:14:32,100
he takes his shirt off and he starts 
dancing and he's dancing around with a 

1703
01:14:32,100 --> 01:14:32,710
shirt off.
Then he starts doing pushups and then he

1704
01:14:32,711 --> 01:14:35,710
starts talking to pushups,
doing pushups on stage with no shirt on.

1705
01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:37,720
And then he starts talking to people in 
the audience.

1706
01:14:37,960 --> 01:14:42,960
So either he's just like trying to come 
up with some new material and just going

1707
01:14:43,210 --> 01:14:46,810
deep into the crazy ben or he's really 
legitimately losing his mind.

1708
01:14:48,220 --> 01:14:49,750
You know,
we said it before,

1709
01:14:49,751 --> 01:14:51,340
man.
We've said it so many times.

1710
01:14:51,341 --> 01:14:56,341
Brilliant people.
There's a lot of brilliant people that 

1711
01:14:56,341 --> 01:14:58,651
are very close to insanity and I know 
you've been close to and Saturday 

1712
01:14:58,651 --> 01:14:59,100
because I've watched you be close to 
Saturdays here.

1713
01:14:59,150 --> 01:15:00,460
Joey.
Joey's been close to.

1714
01:15:02,280 --> 01:15:05,020
Yeah,
that was normal for Joey.

1715
01:15:05,021 --> 01:15:10,021
That's pretty fucking normal.
I just have to wait for that storm to 

1716
01:15:10,021 --> 01:15:10,021
end,
but.

1717
01:15:10,140 --> 01:15:10,650
No,
no,

1718
01:15:10,850 --> 01:15:11,530
no,
I see.

1719
01:15:11,531 --> 01:15:13,090
I know.
You know what I mean?

1720
01:15:13,290 --> 01:15:18,290
I feel it at times.
I feel it when I get home writing out 

1721
01:15:19,630 --> 01:15:24,630
your podcast,
I've got to force myself out of the 

1722
01:15:24,630 --> 01:15:27,210
fucking house because of that.
That's why you go to into your head.

1723
01:15:27,640 --> 01:15:28,150
Yeah.

1724
01:15:29,010 --> 01:15:34,010
Yeah.
You don't want to be alone with your 

1725
01:15:34,010 --> 01:15:34,010
head.
Sometimes.

1726
01:15:34,010 --> 01:15:34,410
There's moments where you need to 
interact with other people just to get a

1727
01:15:34,411 --> 01:15:35,520
sense of normalcy.
Right?

1728
01:15:36,250 --> 01:15:41,250
When you add them to the point where 
sometimes you're writing and you get 

1729
01:15:41,250 --> 01:15:44,811
into it and you're,
you're there and all of a sudden you 

1730
01:15:44,811 --> 01:15:44,811
fucking mind just go somewhere,
bro.

1731
01:15:44,811 --> 01:15:48,330
It just goes somewhere where it just 
hasn't been in with standups.

1732
01:15:48,331 --> 01:15:50,040
I could see it.
I feel myself slipping.

1733
01:15:50,300 --> 01:15:55,300
I tell you,
I felt myself slipping a lot with the 

1734
01:15:55,300 --> 01:15:57,141
cope when I was on stage when I was 
talking to myself and I caught myself 

1735
01:15:57,141 --> 01:15:58,680
with four to eight and that would catch 
myself at eight.

1736
01:15:58,710 --> 01:16:03,710
Wait a second.
I was just at four a fuck that I get to 

1737
01:16:03,710 --> 01:16:04,230
eight when I was talking about earlier 
about Roger Waters.

1738
01:16:04,690 --> 01:16:06,460
Roger waters the article in rolling 
stone.

1739
01:16:06,490 --> 01:16:08,440
One of the things he was talking about 
his childhood,

1740
01:16:08,710 --> 01:16:12,310
his dad was in the military.
My Dad died when he was really young and

1741
01:16:12,311 --> 01:16:12,670
uh,
you know,

1742
01:16:12,671 --> 01:16:17,671
he grew up without.
There's photos of him and his dad and 

1743
01:16:17,671 --> 01:16:17,671
all of sudden his dad's gone.
That whole,

1744
01:16:17,671 --> 01:16:18,400
that void.
You know,

1745
01:16:18,520 --> 01:16:21,670
there's something about loss and 
childhood.

1746
01:16:21,700 --> 01:16:22,300
You know,
when you,

1747
01:16:22,301 --> 01:16:24,550
when you're young and fucked up,
things happens.

1748
01:16:24,700 --> 01:16:28,330
That creates like seemingly the most 
brilliant people the most,

1749
01:16:28,480 --> 01:16:32,710
but they're also the most likely to do 
something fucking crazy,

1750
01:16:33,180 --> 01:16:38,180
you know,
crazy like looking fucking look at 

1751
01:16:38,180 --> 01:16:38,180
what's going on with Dave Chappelle here
with Dave Chappelle,

1752
01:16:38,180 --> 01:16:42,691
did the other dap and now he goes on 
stage and for 45 fucking minutes it 

1753
01:16:42,691 --> 01:16:46,180
tells one joke and then he says,
this is a test of wills,

1754
01:16:46,210 --> 01:16:48,250
you know,
I'm not gonna say nothing.

1755
01:16:48,250 --> 01:16:50,800
You know what I'm saying?
That Nita and like stays up there for 45

1756
01:16:50,801 --> 01:16:53,860
fucking minutes and know and you know,
and people like,

1757
01:16:53,950 --> 01:16:56,110
I just want,
I just want to be entertained.

1758
01:16:56,111 --> 01:16:57,580
We tell some jokes.
He's like,

1759
01:16:57,581 --> 01:16:58,290
you know,
go see,

1760
01:16:58,300 --> 01:17:00,360
go by my dvds,
you know,

1761
01:17:00,390 --> 01:17:05,390
you'll see you'll be entertained.
Like meanwhile he was just standing on 

1762
01:17:05,390 --> 01:17:06,550
stage like saying nothing for 45 
minutes.

1763
01:17:06,700 --> 01:17:08,530
And again,
this is a lot of hearsay to,

1764
01:17:08,531 --> 01:17:10,640
I don't know the exact story of what 
happened,

1765
01:17:10,641 --> 01:17:12,530
but this is what I keep hearing.
And there was a,

1766
01:17:12,531 --> 01:17:17,531
another video of him going on stage at 
some festival and he bombed there too 

1767
01:17:17,531 --> 01:17:21,770
and he was doing the same thing.
Just standing on stage with no,

1768
01:17:22,280 --> 01:17:22,560
no,
no,

1769
01:17:22,561 --> 01:17:23,890
no.
This is not this.

1770
01:17:23,930 --> 01:17:26,370
He's not doing anything gross.
Just standing on stage.

1771
01:17:27,420 --> 01:17:32,420
I don't know what happens to Comedians,
the comedians life and I could sit here 

1772
01:17:33,740 --> 01:17:38,740
in the next 20 minutes and give you a 
list of them that they think that they 

1773
01:17:38,740 --> 01:17:42,861
go from becoming comedians to thinking 
that I listen to what the fuck they're 

1774
01:17:42,861 --> 01:17:42,861
saying.

1775
01:17:42,861 --> 01:17:43,870
Well,
that's it.

1776
01:17:44,010 --> 01:17:47,800
I was listening to his reading his 
texts.

1777
01:17:47,860 --> 01:17:49,870
He was getting tax was on stage on 
reading though.

1778
01:17:51,150 --> 01:17:54,040
He has this whole new thing,
style of comedy that he's doing.

1779
01:17:54,041 --> 01:17:55,780
I've seen it.
I've seen it twice.

1780
01:17:55,960 --> 01:18:00,400
My friend Demar seen it four times or 
three times and what it is,

1781
01:18:00,410 --> 01:18:05,410
it looks very organic.
Like he starts off and he automatically 

1782
01:18:05,410 --> 01:18:06,430
starts going and we talked about this,
but that's not what he's doing.

1783
01:18:07,170 --> 01:18:12,040
He was doing that.
That was not what they need to show.

1784
01:18:12,130 --> 01:18:15,370
What they're saying is he's not doing 
anything but you're standing on stage.

1785
01:18:15,371 --> 01:18:16,980
Not Saying a word.
No.

1786
01:18:17,090 --> 01:18:19,650
He said he was talking.
He wasn't just sitting there ninth St.

1787
01:18:19,650 --> 01:18:21,880
Jude.
It this latest show that I am talking to

1788
01:18:21,881 --> 01:18:23,770
you about.
I'm not talking to show that you saw.

1789
01:18:23,830 --> 01:18:26,200
I'm saying the show that he did 
recently.

1790
01:18:26,610 --> 01:18:30,220
He got on stage and he was talking about
how it was a battle of wills.

1791
01:18:30,221 --> 01:18:31,990
I'm not gonna say nothing and we'll see 
how long we.

1792
01:18:31,991 --> 01:18:34,690
Last year he was gonna.
He was being quiet and he wanted them to

1793
01:18:34,691 --> 01:18:39,691
be quiet until.
Let's see who breaks first he said 

1794
01:18:39,691 --> 01:18:39,691
nothing and people were losing their 
mind like he.

1795
01:18:39,820 --> 01:18:43,780
He told one joke and then the rest of 
the set he sat around and did nothing.

1796
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:50,040
He.
There's a point with these fucking 

1797
01:18:50,040 --> 01:18:50,040
comedians that they think that they go 
from being a comic.

1798
01:18:50,040 --> 01:18:54,811
The social commentary,
like they did something to that I 

1799
01:18:54,811 --> 01:18:55,420
deserved this social commentary and 
that's what's really going on.

1800
01:18:55,570 --> 01:18:58,420
We've seen it with Eddie Griffin.
We see it with this fucking guy.

1801
01:18:58,421 --> 01:19:02,610
Now we see it with a bunch of comedians.
I see that I put on that button,

1802
01:19:02,780 --> 01:19:06,700
green room or whatever was just to watch
stand hope and I had to put up with your

1803
01:19:06,701 --> 01:19:11,500
buddy from Svu and Janine Garafalo.
The guy says to the fucking guy,

1804
01:19:11,590 --> 01:19:16,590
Richard Belzer,
you know a guy that never said nothing 

1805
01:19:16,590 --> 01:19:16,590
funny this whole fucking life,
and he's asked Dan hope.

1806
01:19:16,590 --> 01:19:18,870
Why the fuck is he there?
But they're sitting in there,

1807
01:19:19,060 --> 01:19:21,550
not even stand open.
Why are you here?

1808
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:24,850
And Stan hope goes because I came to see
the suck my dick fest.

1809
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:26,480
Between you and Janine Garafalo.

1810
01:19:27,350 --> 01:19:28,060
Yeah.
And then he goes,

1811
01:19:28,061 --> 01:19:30,520
well,
a literally like trying to be cute.

1812
01:19:30,521 --> 01:19:35,521
You know,
like these fucking idiots in Hollywood 

1813
01:19:35,521 --> 01:19:37,500
do like literally.
How about I get up and put my dick in 

1814
01:19:37,500 --> 01:19:40,471
your mouth and prevents Matt just to 
show you how we're going to do this 

1815
01:19:40,471 --> 01:19:43,140
here.
Somewhere along the line these comics 

1816
01:19:43,140 --> 01:19:43,140
think that we need their social 
commentary and we fucking don't.

1817
01:19:43,240 --> 01:19:46,420
We fucking don't.
We don't give a fuck what you think.

1818
01:19:46,600 --> 01:19:50,500
Just tell us fucking jokes guy.
Just tell us jokes.

1819
01:19:50,740 --> 01:19:53,470
We don't give a fuck.
Nobody gives a fuck.

1820
01:19:53,740 --> 01:19:57,100
That's when a show goes sour because 
nobody gives a fuck.

1821
01:19:57,460 --> 01:20:00,280
We paid to see you do an hour of 
material.

1822
01:20:00,770 --> 01:20:04,510
If at the last two minutes you want to 
summarize your set and do it,

1823
01:20:04,720 --> 01:20:06,400
do it,
but if you're going to summarize it with

1824
01:20:06,401 --> 01:20:11,401
bullshit that don't live by anyway,
shut your mouth and just do the fucking 

1825
01:20:11,401 --> 01:20:11,401
jokes,
Bro.

1826
01:20:11,401 --> 01:20:16,100
That's my big problem lately.
Nobody wants to shut that fucking mouth 

1827
01:20:16,100 --> 01:20:16,280
either.
Do the jokes to shut the fucking map.

1828
01:20:16,470 --> 01:20:21,470
What is all this chitter chatter about?
Stupidity for that day in that green 

1829
01:20:21,470 --> 01:20:21,720
room.
I'm trying to watch stand hope.

1830
01:20:21,721 --> 01:20:24,030
One of the most brilliant comments,
a dear friend of mine,

1831
01:20:24,300 --> 01:20:27,720
I couldn't watch it.
Janeane Garofalo saying that the guy and

1832
01:20:28,070 --> 01:20:33,070
in Tucson that killed the fucking,
that tried to kill the congressman was 

1833
01:20:33,070 --> 01:20:35,640
pushed to kill him because social media 
force them.

1834
01:20:35,850 --> 01:20:37,650
First of all,
when she said that,

1835
01:20:37,890 --> 01:20:39,870
that's not what a comedian worries is.
She really says that.

1836
01:20:39,871 --> 01:20:44,871
What a career.
A real comedian doesn't worry about 

1837
01:20:44,871 --> 01:20:48,171
that.
That's somebody who wants you to think 

1838
01:20:48,171 --> 01:20:48,171
that they care.
So like me,

1839
01:20:48,171 --> 01:20:50,930
because I do care.
You don't care that it's fake tattoos.

1840
01:20:50,940 --> 01:20:53,240
You got to fake.
You know?

1841
01:20:53,370 --> 01:20:55,350
That's what they care about.
That's what we're talking about.

1842
01:20:55,590 --> 01:20:57,180
Whether it's a fad or whatever the fuck 
it,

1843
01:20:57,210 --> 01:20:59,520
I can't deal with it no more want me to 
make me feel,

1844
01:20:59,540 --> 01:21:00,960
make me funny,
make me laugh.

1845
01:21:01,380 --> 01:21:05,640
I would refuse to go on stage and give 
you my opinion of the White House,

1846
01:21:05,641 --> 01:21:07,300
so the tea party,
because at the end of the week,

1847
01:21:07,350 --> 01:21:09,960
nomadic guy,
I paid to watch you do jokes.

1848
01:21:10,260 --> 01:21:11,880
I want you to take me through your 
world,

1849
01:21:12,660 --> 01:21:17,660
but that's it.
I don't want to hear no social 

1850
01:21:17,660 --> 01:21:17,660
commentary and we've seen it from a lot 
of comedians,

1851
01:21:17,660 --> 01:21:18,420
bro.
After a 55 minute mark,

1852
01:21:18,421 --> 01:21:21,390
I think I got to listen to this shit.
Do your 55 minutes.

1853
01:21:21,470 --> 01:21:22,220
Well,
they also,

1854
01:21:22,221 --> 01:21:26,320
they've developed a following of people 
who hang on every word and you know,

1855
01:21:26,330 --> 01:21:31,330
there's a lot of them that think they 
have something brilliant to say and so 

1856
01:21:31,330 --> 01:21:31,580
they choose the venue of standup comedy 
and look,

1857
01:21:31,590 --> 01:21:33,690
this fucking podcast is a perfect 
example of the.

1858
01:21:33,691 --> 01:21:34,930
A lot of times people have something to 
say.

1859
01:21:34,940 --> 01:21:36,770
It's not necessarily funny,
but it's interesting,

1860
01:21:37,010 --> 01:21:40,980
but this is the right venue for it.
A podcast is the right venue for us.

1861
01:21:41,180 --> 01:21:43,820
This is not what I would ever do on 
stage when I do,

1862
01:21:43,880 --> 01:21:48,880
when I do my set,
I have a fucking set I'll fuck around a 

1863
01:21:48,880 --> 01:21:48,880
little bit,
but I'm trying to be funny period period

1864
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:54,470
and that's because people used to always
think that like comedy should be used in

1865
01:21:54,471 --> 01:21:59,471
some way to like educate,
educate people in the light and people 

1866
01:21:59,471 --> 01:22:02,471
and then it's important to do that.
And almost to the point of sacrificing 

1867
01:22:02,471 --> 01:22:02,471
comedy.
Like,

1868
01:22:02,471 --> 01:22:06,611
you know,
Bill Hicks had some material that was 

1869
01:22:06,611 --> 01:22:06,611
like that where it was not funny at all.

1870
01:22:06,611 --> 01:22:06,670
At the end.
Bill his wasn't funny.

1871
01:22:06,980 --> 01:22:09,940
Let's get out of the way at the end,
the Lance Williams garbage.

1872
01:22:10,090 --> 01:22:11,890
Listen to the live from the village 
gate.

1873
01:22:12,040 --> 01:22:17,040
That's almost.
You could even hear the people like 

1874
01:22:17,040 --> 01:22:17,170
ready to laugh and was like,
Oh God.

1875
01:22:17,320 --> 01:22:19,030
Well some of his stuff like he.
Yeah,

1876
01:22:19,031 --> 01:22:24,031
that was actually before the life in the
village gate one was earlier and what 

1877
01:22:24,031 --> 01:22:27,481
that was like.
He did the bid on abortion and this is 

1878
01:22:27,481 --> 01:22:27,481
what I'm talking about him.
He was like,

1879
01:22:27,481 --> 01:22:27,940
you know,
like you don't want people to abortion.

1880
01:22:28,090 --> 01:22:31,780
Then you fucking raise them,
you fucking raise them.

1881
01:22:31,781 --> 01:22:34,390
That's what he was yelling at.
You fucking raised the kids and there is

1882
01:22:34,391 --> 01:22:35,950
no joke and I'm like,
wow,

1883
01:22:35,951 --> 01:22:37,450
this is a mess.
This is a mess.

1884
01:22:37,451 --> 01:22:39,080
This is a comedy club.
Okay.

1885
01:22:39,090 --> 01:22:42,070
You just yelling out.
You fucking raise them and being irate.

1886
01:22:42,340 --> 01:22:43,570
Yes,
you're right.

1887
01:22:43,571 --> 01:22:48,571
I see your point.
If you don't want people to have 

1888
01:22:48,571 --> 01:22:48,571
abortions,
then you should raise their children.

1889
01:22:48,571 --> 01:22:49,170
I see what you're saying that you should
get involved.

1890
01:22:49,190 --> 01:22:52,510
I see what you're saying,
but you're not being funny period.

1891
01:22:52,540 --> 01:22:53,350
That's not a joke.

1892
01:22:53,470 --> 01:22:56,080
You know,
and that's a thing that happens to a lot

1893
01:22:56,081 --> 01:22:57,520
of comics.
It's they,

1894
01:22:57,550 --> 01:23:01,240
they start to get people who want to 
listen to them.

1895
01:23:01,390 --> 01:23:04,240
They start to get people who think 
they're deep and they start listening to

1896
01:23:04,241 --> 01:23:09,241
those people and they do this at a 
comedy club and they up at a comedy 

1897
01:23:09,241 --> 01:23:09,850
club.
We've seen it happen.

1898
01:23:09,910 --> 01:23:14,910
We've seen it happen in so many titles.
I thought there was this fucking kid 

1899
01:23:14,910 --> 01:23:14,910
from Jimmy's comedy.
Allah.

1900
01:23:14,910 --> 01:23:15,130
God Damn,
I forget his name,

1901
01:23:15,520 --> 01:23:17,290
but he's really.
He was really funny.

1902
01:23:17,310 --> 01:23:20,230
He was kind of crazy.
He was really funny and this was like in

1903
01:23:20,231 --> 01:23:22,870
the the late eighties,
early nineties,

1904
01:23:23,110 --> 01:23:26,650
and he came to Hollywood.
He drove to La and it was working at the

1905
01:23:26,651 --> 01:23:28,930
comedy store for awhile.
Do you remember the kid?

1906
01:23:29,510 --> 01:23:31,090
Kind of good looking guy,
but overweight.

1907
01:23:31,630 --> 01:23:33,640
Fucking forget his name.
It drives me nuts,

1908
01:23:33,820 --> 01:23:35,710
but he was a perfect example of that.

1909
01:23:35,860 --> 01:23:37,510
He would go on stage at the comedy 
store.

1910
01:23:37,511 --> 01:23:39,880
They fucking tortured him.
They tortured him.

1911
01:23:40,030 --> 01:23:43,330
Can you go onstage and try to be like 
deep and meaningful when he was funny,

1912
01:23:43,331 --> 01:23:46,510
he can be really funny.
Like you had some good bits.

1913
01:23:46,910 --> 01:23:48,850
I'm fucking good.
Bit about hair club for men.

1914
01:23:49,150 --> 01:23:50,320
It was really funny.
You know,

1915
01:23:50,321 --> 01:23:54,280
they show the guy playing tennis and 
they show the guy swimming.

1916
01:23:54,440 --> 01:23:55,110
He goes,
what?

1917
01:23:55,111 --> 01:24:00,111
They should show a guy.
It's pulling out and shooting his 

1918
01:24:00,111 --> 01:24:00,310
fucking load on some chicks back,
you know,

1919
01:24:00,311 --> 01:24:01,810
and she goes,
nice hair.

1920
01:24:03,790 --> 01:24:06,910
He had a fucking real good bit about 
some good bits.

1921
01:24:06,970 --> 01:24:08,740
We went to the store one day.
I mean,

1922
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:13,800
you know,
like when you go to an open mic and just

1923
01:24:13,961 --> 01:24:14,620
sit down.
Yeah,

1924
01:24:14,621 --> 01:24:16,210
we do that all the time.
Kid,

1925
01:24:16,211 --> 01:24:21,211
that window that was older and he goes,
let me give you a personal issue with my

1926
01:24:21,640 --> 01:24:23,050
Italian family portrait.

1927
01:24:23,710 --> 01:24:28,710
That would be bad.
We just die like this joke ever goes.

1928
01:24:29,260 --> 01:24:34,260
This was in my impersonation of my.
This is a portrait of my Italian family.

1929
01:24:36,130 --> 01:24:41,130
He was leaning for folks at home.
He had put his hands up like someone's 

1930
01:24:41,130 --> 01:24:44,941
trying to take his picture,
but sometimes like I was telling 

1931
01:24:45,011 --> 01:24:49,210
somebody that they're the best joke.
I heard that you off my fucking ever was

1932
01:24:49,211 --> 01:24:54,211
Charlie Hill at the store when you're 
stoned talking to somebody and he's 

1933
01:24:54,211 --> 01:24:54,211
back.
Then he goes,

1934
01:24:54,211 --> 01:24:54,730
how are you doing?
My name is Charlie Hill.

1935
01:24:55,030 --> 01:24:57,460
My real name was mountain,
but they shortened the dog.

1936
01:24:57,520 --> 01:25:01,030
I fucking lost my cookies at that dumb.
Just because you're high.

1937
01:25:01,320 --> 01:25:06,320

1941
01:25:17,700 --> 01:25:18,430

1968
01:26:28,611 --> 01:26:31,460

01:26:41,271 --> 01:26:46,271

chick named stacy corine who have.

1975
01:26:47,810 --> 01:26:51,080
Uncle was a big time gangster up there.
I never knew what they told me after it.

1976
01:26:51,081 --> 01:26:52,130
You know you robbed,
robbed.

1977
01:26:52,280 --> 01:26:54,020
I robbed her in Aspen.
Robert.

1978
01:26:54,410 --> 01:26:58,220
I broke into a fucking house and she had
1800 cash and a chunk of Hash.

1979
01:26:58,520 --> 01:27:00,890
Not This ally ship that these idiots are
smoking this shit.

1980
01:27:00,891 --> 01:27:05,891
That stat from the fucking emperor of 
each stamped fucking gold stamp.

1981
01:27:06,411 --> 01:27:09,250
And you see that stamp on a piece of 
Hash when somebody gives you a pizza ash

1982
01:27:09,500 --> 01:27:11,420
and you see that little rim with a 
stamp,

1983
01:27:11,750 --> 01:27:13,250
your fucking smoking.
The good shit.

1984
01:27:13,440 --> 01:27:14,780
This shit,
they give you a Hollywood.

1985
01:27:14,830 --> 01:27:19,830
And what happens is,
is the thc that they just there to have 

1986
01:27:19,830 --> 01:27:21,380
all that shit.
How do you make it at what,

1987
01:27:21,381 --> 01:27:26,381
uh,
what am I a fucking bakers knowing that 

1988
01:27:26,381 --> 01:27:26,381
it comes from,
you know,

1989
01:27:26,381 --> 01:27:29,470
someone,
they just made a fucking law recently 

1990
01:27:29,470 --> 01:27:29,870
where you can get life in jail for 
fucking making hash.

1991
01:27:30,120 --> 01:27:33,030
I just read somewhere that it was just.
No,

1992
01:27:33,050 --> 01:27:35,120
it's not necessary.
There's a method to making it.

1993
01:27:35,121 --> 01:27:40,121
I don't know what the method is.
Jail for making fucking passed in some 

1994
01:27:40,641 --> 01:27:43,310
stupid state.
So she was retaliation from whatever.

1995
01:27:43,330 --> 01:27:48,330
And she was a drug dealer.
That's why I robbed because she was a 

1996
01:27:48,330 --> 01:27:48,330
drug that in Robert's decided because I 
wanted to Robert,

1997
01:27:48,330 --> 01:27:50,660
but she used to always tell me that 
there was great food in Milwaukee.

1998
01:27:50,661 --> 01:27:51,930
And I'm like,
are you fucking middle?

1999
01:27:52,050 --> 01:27:52,990
What are you going to do?
What do you eat?

2000
01:27:53,030 --> 01:27:54,290
Cheese with it.
Well,

2001
01:27:54,291 --> 01:27:59,291
this is another part of it that a lot of
people don't know with Donnie Brasco 

2002
01:27:59,291 --> 01:28:02,831
busted all those people.
Half of the people he busted weren't in 

2003
01:28:02,831 --> 01:28:02,831
New York.
They were in Milwaukee.

2004
01:28:02,831 --> 01:28:05,000
He busted this crew up there.
That was the ballasts theories.

2005
01:28:05,001 --> 01:28:08,150
They ran a vending machines all over the
country,

2006
01:28:08,180 --> 01:28:08,840
big time.

2007
01:28:08,840 --> 01:28:10,970
All over these vending machine 
companies,

2008
01:28:10,971 --> 01:28:14,480
whether he's guys.
So he went to Milwaukee and busted these

2009
01:28:14,481 --> 01:28:17,140
motherfuckers like 40 of them.
I'm not kidding you.

2010
01:28:17,141 --> 01:28:22,141
It just doesn't say in the movie because
don't have enough time to put it in the 

2011
01:28:22,141 --> 01:28:24,461
fucking stupid movie,
but there's a big Italian community and 

2012
01:28:24,461 --> 01:28:25,690
fucking Milwaukee.
That's amazing.

2013
01:28:25,790 --> 01:28:27,170
Big Chinese.
I'll tell you,

2014
01:28:27,171 --> 01:28:30,530
one of the best meatball sandwiches I've
ever had was in fucking Milwaukee.

2015
01:28:30,770 --> 01:28:33,170
Really?
I'm telling you one of the best sauces I

2016
01:28:33,171 --> 01:28:35,210
went there and five days in a row.
How long have you known me?

2017
01:28:35,420 --> 01:28:37,970
Five in a row for lunch and they will 
open for dinner.

2018
01:28:37,971 --> 01:28:40,400
I would have gone for dinner.
They we're open for breakfast and lunch.

2019
01:28:40,401 --> 01:28:44,030
It was one of those Italian,
but it's the delicate Toros,

2020
01:28:44,040 --> 01:28:49,040
you know what I mean?
Not with the shit hanging in the goat 

2021
01:28:49,040 --> 01:28:52,131
hang and a fucking cheese and cheese.
So we're going.

2022
01:28:53,400 --> 01:28:54,310
All right.

2023
01:28:54,320 --> 01:28:55,070

2025
01:28:56,631 --> 01:28:59,940
I have up here in the valley.
That place is fucking great food.

2026
01:28:59,960 --> 01:29:01,990
Listening to California and the fucking

2027
01:29:02,030 --> 01:29:04,310
valley though.
There's some shit and the value.

2028
01:29:04,320 --> 01:29:05,610
That is brilliant.
What is it?

2029
01:29:05,611 --> 01:29:06,980
Canoga park there.
Cabaretta.

2030
01:29:07,440 --> 01:29:08,760
God Damn.
That place is good.

2031
01:29:08,761 --> 01:29:13,761
If you are looking for.
If you're in the valley and you looking 

2032
01:29:13,761 --> 01:29:15,090
for real Italian sausage and pepper 
sandwich.

2033
01:29:15,420 --> 01:29:18,510
Oh my God is a good sausage and peppers 
with tomato sauce.

2034
01:29:18,511 --> 01:29:20,250
I.
It's terrible for you.

2035
01:29:20,340 --> 01:29:22,820
So I only get it once a month,
but what I get it,

2036
01:29:22,821 --> 01:29:26,910
it sits in like once a month.
Once a week?

2037
01:29:27,170 --> 01:29:27,900
Yeah.
Once a day.

2038
01:29:28,380 --> 01:29:30,810
Once a day.
Once a day.

2039
01:29:30,811 --> 01:29:32,270
Dog.
You have a fucking audit tax.

2040
01:29:32,310 --> 01:29:37,140
Trust me,
I have to fucking Tanya Cabaretta.

2041
01:29:37,180 --> 01:29:42,180
They say they sell it in a giant tray 
and you take it home and eat that shit 

2042
01:29:42,180 --> 01:29:45,120
up and it's fucking jamming.
That place is full.

2043
01:29:45,121 --> 01:29:50,121
Legit.
There's not another sausage and pepper 

2044
01:29:50,121 --> 01:29:50,340
sub you could buy in La.
Where the fuck else is there?

2045
01:29:50,400 --> 01:29:52,600
Where's your sausage and pepper sub with
tomato sauce?

2046
01:29:52,740 --> 01:29:55,410
A real one.
I got this place is good and if you take

2047
01:29:55,411 --> 01:29:57,240

said,

2048
01:29:57,241 --> 01:30:02,241
well you chop these up in there,
they'll take you those hot because you 

2049
01:30:02,241 --> 01:30:02,241
can't buy hot cherry peppers were the 
fucking.

2050
01:30:02,241 --> 01:30:05,040
You get them.
Only if this place Italian place.

2051
01:30:05,050 --> 01:30:07,270
I must be in a tiny place with the.
Oh,

2052
01:30:07,280 --> 01:30:11,310
the presumed inside and cheese.
Oh my God.

2053
01:30:11,311 --> 01:30:14,770
I get they called Hepa Obama's.
That's so good.

2054
01:30:14,820 --> 01:30:19,820
I put it.
Just gives it to him because the other 

2055
01:30:19,820 --> 01:30:22,570

2057
01:30:25,300 --> 01:30:27,300
Canola guy.
They'll eat the fuck.

2058
01:30:27,301 --> 01:30:32,301
I it really know.
I'll beat the fuck out of this place is 

2059
01:30:32,820 --> 01:30:35,310
don't want to show this to.
You could print this up.

2060
01:30:35,510 --> 01:30:36,400
Not Printing.
What is it?

2061
01:30:36,401 --> 01:30:38,740
You're one of the guys from Joe 
Rogan.net

2062
01:30:38,910 --> 01:30:43,910
hit me up and he wanted a copy of this 
when I got bugged by the feds at your 

2063
01:30:44,121 --> 01:30:44,490
address.

2064
01:30:45,540 --> 01:30:47,130
Don't give a fuck.
It's my old address.

2065
01:30:47,430 --> 01:30:50,700
What is it?
They have to after nine slash 11,

2066
01:30:51,120 --> 01:30:53,850
if a drug,
if anybody whose phone is tapped,

2067
01:30:53,880 --> 01:30:56,580
they call you right after the person 
goes to trial,

2068
01:30:56,850 --> 01:31:01,850
the government supposed to send you an 
affidavit claiming the date you were on 

2069
01:31:01,850 --> 01:31:05,520
the phone with them and all that shit.
So I was telling this kid this.

2070
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:08,170
I was saying on the podcast before,
and I think he doubted me.

2071
01:31:08,550 --> 01:31:10,000
He goes,
can you please bring the paper?

2072
01:31:10,030 --> 01:31:10,580
Yeah.
You know what?

2073
01:31:10,710 --> 01:31:12,840
There's a lot of people on my message 
board.

2074
01:31:13,050 --> 01:31:17,010
You guys are some disrespectful fucking 
shit heads.

2075
01:31:17,310 --> 01:31:19,590
Some of you guys who don't believe 
things,

2076
01:31:19,650 --> 01:31:23,490
you're so fucking rude about it.
And one of the things is joey.

2077
01:31:23,650 --> 01:31:25,150
So don't,
don't hold this up bro.

2078
01:31:25,570 --> 01:31:27,690
We gotta treat this like everybody can 
hear this.

2079
01:31:27,930 --> 01:31:28,920
You can read it if you like.

2080
01:31:29,250 --> 01:31:31,710
But um,
so many people say,

2081
01:31:31,711 --> 01:31:33,010
oh,
this good comes onto the podcast.

2082
01:31:33,020 --> 01:31:34,980
We just launched and tell stupid 
stories.

2083
01:31:35,820 --> 01:31:40,820
Joey Diaz was not allying crazy,
crazy life.

2084
01:31:41,040 --> 01:31:42,780
I don't give a fuck.
I've known.

2085
01:31:43,230 --> 01:31:44,880
I've known Joe.
If you only think about me,

2086
01:31:44,881 --> 01:31:46,920
I don't give a fuck about.
None of your motherfucking got no reason

2087
01:31:46,921 --> 01:31:47,970
to lie.
I don't owe you nothing.

2088
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,580
They don't know.
Send the thief lighter.

2089
01:31:50,590 --> 01:31:55,590
No one.
Why ruin it with ally and if ain't 

2090
01:31:55,590 --> 01:31:55,590
nothing,
it ain't gotta lie.

2091
01:31:55,590 --> 01:31:59,780
They don't know how you're living.
I got to know when I met you roles and 

2092
01:31:59,780 --> 01:31:59,800
hang on your all day

2093
01:32:00,010 --> 01:32:02,140
saying shit.
The people get a fucking life.

2094
01:32:02,141 --> 01:32:05,500
You fucking maggots get a fucking life.
It's over.

2095
01:32:05,830 --> 01:32:08,380
He don't want to say to you,
but I'll just read.

2096
01:32:09,070 --> 01:32:14,070
Most of them are taken advantage of the 
fact that there are non day and they 

2097
01:32:14,070 --> 01:32:16,060
judge people and it's not just mainly do
everybody.

2098
01:32:16,320 --> 01:32:19,650
I've seen somebody do to fucking like a 
music thing with kids the other day.

2099
01:32:19,651 --> 01:32:20,770
It's like,
you know what man?

2100
01:32:20,920 --> 01:32:22,510
Who the fuck are you?
What have you done?

2101
01:32:22,720 --> 01:32:24,400
And then when you go to the youtube 
page,

2102
01:32:24,401 --> 01:32:26,170
they have done nothing.
They're nothing.

2103
01:32:26,171 --> 01:32:28,320
They just to put videos up a burden.
Shit.

2104
01:32:28,720 --> 01:32:31,480
Well I don't think you have to do 
something to have an opinion aside,

2105
01:32:31,710 --> 01:32:34,140
but you know what,
if you don't have to be a can't,

2106
01:32:34,270 --> 01:32:39,270
you'd have to be a cut.
Be Straight instead of given it to me 

2107
01:32:39,270 --> 01:32:39,970
with an anonymous fuckin and give it to 
me intelligently.

2108
01:32:40,150 --> 01:32:45,150
I had a chick last much Joe Rogan who 
sent me the best emm or an email I ever 

2109
01:32:45,150 --> 01:32:49,561
got.
She said she went to a show and she was 

2110
01:32:49,561 --> 01:32:52,141
very unhappy with my family.
She didn't like that it was dirty and 

2111
01:32:52,141 --> 01:32:55,641
you know what?
Ten years ago I would've said suck my 

2112
01:32:55,641 --> 01:32:56,440
dick.
And I emailed her back like a man.

2113
01:32:56,441 --> 01:32:57,620
You know what she said to me?
She weren't.

2114
01:32:57,760 --> 01:33:00,070
You were funny,
but they didn't need the necessity,

2115
01:33:00,071 --> 01:33:00,880
that curse.
And I said,

2116
01:33:00,881 --> 01:33:03,760
you should have said that you hurt my 
feelings.

2117
01:33:03,761 --> 01:33:05,050
She goes,
I didn't mean to hurt your feelings.

2118
01:33:05,051 --> 01:33:10,051
She goes,
I just thought there was more to you 

2119
01:33:10,051 --> 01:33:11,851
than curse.
I'm picturing Joey Diaz along with his 

2120
01:33:11,851 --> 01:33:11,851
nine fucking carrots answering this 
pitches.

2121
01:33:11,851 --> 01:33:13,740
Email 11.
No,

2122
01:33:13,840 --> 01:33:14,990
I got gotta.
I got it.

2123
01:33:14,991 --> 01:33:16,690
You know you gotta answer these emails 
from people,

2124
01:33:17,050 --> 01:33:18,400
but it's really funny,
like when somebody,

2125
01:33:18,401 --> 01:33:20,530
like somebody said you didn't put the 
drain on your Dick,

2126
01:33:21,040 --> 01:33:22,180
who would make that up?

2127
01:33:23,170 --> 01:33:25,420
Why would you make that up?
I'm telling you that I'm.

2128
01:33:25,870 --> 01:33:30,870
It's like you don't have an agent like a
big time agent that moved away and now 

2129
01:33:30,870 --> 01:33:32,630
he's in Dallas,
so his name was first on.

2130
01:33:32,640 --> 01:33:35,680
I am Deb.
Do you know how many fucking people send

2131
01:33:35,681 --> 01:33:38,170
him emails once a week telling me to 
take the.

2132
01:33:38,190 --> 01:33:40,030
Had a Mug,
a fag video off.

2133
01:33:40,930 --> 01:33:45,930
So wait a second.
I'm telling you a story that a fag beat 

2134
01:33:45,930 --> 01:33:46,580
the fuck out.
I go confused agents,

2135
01:33:46,670 --> 01:33:49,210
but this agent is the tap,
but he moved.

2136
01:33:49,211 --> 01:33:50,770
Now he's in Dallas.
He's a big time,

2137
01:33:51,010 --> 01:33:56,010
big time agent.
He handles athletes now and he was 

2138
01:33:56,010 --> 01:33:56,080
telling you to take that video now.
Me One morning he was dog.

2139
01:33:56,140 --> 01:33:58,810
You have a video on there,
but bargain fags.

2140
01:33:59,380 --> 01:34:00,970
He's in fucking Austin,
Texas.

2141
01:34:01,350 --> 01:34:03,930
He,
he's a sports agent and he got his dog.

2142
01:34:03,940 --> 01:34:05,260
I keep getting emails from people.

2143
01:34:05,260 --> 01:34:08,240
It was late last year saying that you 
better take the video.

2144
01:34:08,250 --> 01:34:10,440
Did you mug a fag?
And I got.

2145
01:34:10,450 --> 01:34:14,380
Why would I lie about getting beat up by
a fucking guy?

2146
01:34:14,920 --> 01:34:17,140
Why would somebody lie about something 
like that?

2147
01:34:17,590 --> 01:34:19,300
Like why?
What would make something like that?

2148
01:34:19,301 --> 01:34:23,380
I can say if I beat up 10 fags or I 
stabbed him and throw him over the cliff

2149
01:34:23,381 --> 01:34:24,550
or fucking Joe,
he's lying,

2150
01:34:24,850 --> 01:34:27,400
but who would lie about getting beat up 
by the fucking guy?

2151
01:34:27,940 --> 01:34:29,110
Who Will?
Why would somebody make?

2152
01:34:29,200 --> 01:34:32,050
People wouldn't make stories up,
but the point is you don't know.

2153
01:34:32,051 --> 01:34:37,051
Why would I would?
Because you're crazy if you're a crazy 

2154
01:34:37,051 --> 01:34:37,051
person.
Ever understood what it was.

2155
01:34:37,051 --> 01:34:38,370
I can't even lie on stage.
Oh,

2156
01:34:38,371 --> 01:34:39,750
I know a lot of people who lie.
Oh,

2157
01:34:39,751 --> 01:34:44,570
they all make up stories on stage.
They might not.

2158
01:34:44,600 --> 01:34:46,510
I don't want to hear about that,
but I can't even.

2159
01:34:46,511 --> 01:34:51,511
Like I see.
I see a friend of my neck quit drinking 

2160
01:34:51,511 --> 01:34:51,511
and she's still doing drinking jokes on 
stage.

2161
01:34:51,511 --> 01:34:52,150
Why are you doing that?
Really?

2162
01:34:52,180 --> 01:34:53,650
You're doing that.
You can't commit that.

2163
01:34:53,680 --> 01:34:55,750
Why doesn't she does talk about how she 
quit drinking,

2164
01:34:55,751 --> 01:34:57,010
but she used to do this.
What?

2165
01:34:57,080 --> 01:34:58,100
Fuck up my that say something

2166
01:34:58,100 --> 01:34:59,570
to them.
I just move on with my life.

2167
01:34:59,780 --> 01:35:04,780
I'm just making a fuck quote here.
It's like we need to go on up on st and 

2168
01:35:04,780 --> 01:35:04,780
doing cocaine jokes.
I'll do it.

2169
01:35:04,780 --> 01:35:06,170
I don't live it no more.
I don't even know what that's like.

2170
01:35:06,350 --> 01:35:08,750
Why would I talk about it?
I talk about it.

2171
01:35:08,751 --> 01:35:10,040
Yeah,
in the years before,

2172
01:35:10,310 --> 01:35:15,310
but I can't stand with those.
Another thing you did that night of the 

2173
01:35:15,310 --> 01:35:18,431
wounded soldier,
you were making fun of me because I had 

2174
01:35:18,431 --> 01:35:20,921
a five hour energy drink and go,
what are you doing with that fucking 

2175
01:35:20,921 --> 01:35:20,921
five hour energy?
And you went on stage with that.

2176
01:35:20,921 --> 01:35:21,650
He goes,
five hour energy drink.

2177
01:35:21,710 --> 01:35:22,190
He goes,
you know what?

2178
01:35:22,191 --> 01:35:26,180
I do a and I wake up in the morning and 
I have all fucking big line.

2179
01:35:26,300 --> 01:35:29,480
I snot a big line of cocaine as y'all 
fucking five hours,

2180
01:35:30,170 --> 01:35:30,600
eight ball.

2181
01:35:30,650 --> 01:35:35,650
That's it.
But for five hours it was red bands 

2182
01:35:35,650 --> 01:35:38,280
birthday and this week Mr Rogan has a 
birthday this week.

2183
01:35:38,281 --> 01:35:43,281
He told,
I forgot you're 37 now you're going to 

2184
01:35:43,281 --> 01:35:43,281
have to grow up eventually.
You know what is your birthday?

2185
01:35:43,281 --> 01:35:45,290
Don't you start getting the 11th,
August 11th.

2186
01:35:45,291 --> 01:35:46,530
That's,
that's what is this day.

2187
01:35:46,670 --> 01:35:47,840
Two days.
Two days for.

2188
01:35:47,841 --> 01:35:52,841
Oh Shit.

01:35:52,890 --> 01:35:54,260

We'll do it.

2192
01:35:55,520 --> 01:35:57,220
Who's coming?
Why don't you have all of us?

2193
01:35:57,440 --> 01:35:59,870
Because I got to work all this week.
I'm back to the grind.

2194
01:36:00,560 --> 01:36:05,560
Back to fear factor family after I got 
them doing everyday this week because 

2195
01:36:05,560 --> 01:36:09,650
Friday we're bolting to Milwaukee for 
this pabst theater.

2196
01:36:11,420 --> 01:36:12,770
That's August 13th.
Milwaukee,

2197
01:36:12,771 --> 01:36:14,750
PAPP's theater.
Me and Joe Diaz.

2198
01:36:14,780 --> 01:36:16,630
Tickets are almost sold out.
Get in it.

2199
01:36:16,640 --> 01:36:18,470
Pitches,
don't sleep.

2200
01:36:19,100 --> 01:36:19,820
I'm looking forward to that.

2201
01:36:19,820 --> 01:36:21,200
We're going to have a good time.
I can't wait.

2202
01:36:21,230 --> 01:36:23,660
I've been looking for is the last time 
we did a Gig was a vegas.

2203
01:36:23,950 --> 01:36:25,370
No,
we just did Irvine.

2204
01:36:25,910 --> 01:36:26,510
Oh No,
no.

2205
01:36:26,570 --> 01:36:29,050
Pasadena.
We did the Irvine in Pasadena,

2206
01:36:29,350 --> 01:36:31,820
but I still got an email.
The last theater we did.

2207
01:36:31,821 --> 01:36:33,690
I'm thinking that's the theater we did 
on the road.

2208
01:36:33,950 --> 01:36:37,970
Pittsburgh.
Pittsburgh was fucking awesome data.

2209
01:36:38,120 --> 01:36:40,340
That library.
It used to be a library.

2210
01:36:40,730 --> 01:36:45,730
Fucking great.
Carnegie Library Music called fucking 

2211
01:36:45,730 --> 01:36:46,070
place was awesome.
Pittsburgh is great.

2212
01:36:46,480 --> 01:36:51,480
It's one of the things we were saying.
It's one of the most underrated fucking 

2213
01:36:51,480 --> 01:36:54,071
cities.
We didn't like it when we did that 

2214
01:36:54,071 --> 01:36:54,071
Improv.
I didn't go with you that time.

2215
01:36:54,071 --> 01:36:55,040
I had been there before.
I used to go to the funny bone.

2216
01:36:55,041 --> 01:37:00,041
It was okay.
Like the Chinese food as well when we 

2217
01:37:00,041 --> 01:37:02,261
were there.
The one of the reasons why we didn't 

2218
01:37:02,261 --> 01:37:03,701
like it is because there was apparently 
there was some fucking sports thing 

2219
01:37:03,701 --> 01:37:03,701
going on,
some did.

2220
01:37:03,701 --> 01:37:08,610
They're a really loyal to their teams 
and when you got like a big game going 

2221
01:37:08,610 --> 01:37:09,410
on,
nobody wants to go to see nothing.

2222
01:37:09,590 --> 01:37:14,590
And even people that bought tickets 
didn't come to the show because it was 

2223
01:37:14,590 --> 01:37:18,161
some big sports game.
Some football game or I don't know what 

2224
01:37:18,161 --> 01:37:21,671
the fuck it was.
Team is in first place in baseball and 

2225
01:37:21,671 --> 01:37:24,071
you know what,
didn't they win the world series or 

2226
01:37:24,071 --> 01:37:24,071
something this year?
No,

2227
01:37:24,071 --> 01:37:24,071
no,
no.

2228
01:37:24,071 --> 01:37:25,310
But they're there right now.
They're super long.

2229
01:37:26,020 --> 01:37:27,470
Uh,
what did the steelers.

2230
01:37:27,500 --> 01:37:28,400
Yeah,
I think so.

2231
01:37:28,401 --> 01:37:29,270
Sorry.
I can't remember.

2232
01:37:29,420 --> 01:37:30,410
How funny is that?
We don't know.

2233
01:37:30,411 --> 01:37:32,720
Shit.
I can't fucking remember.

2234
01:37:32,721 --> 01:37:35,480
But you're trying to be funny Brian.
There a cricket doesn't.

2235
01:37:35,481 --> 01:37:38,480
They don't play cricket in the manual 
that you fucked her room.

2236
01:37:38,780 --> 01:37:39,530
There's nothing in there,
bro.

2237
01:37:39,730 --> 01:37:41,000
Empty.
I drank,

2238
01:37:41,350 --> 01:37:42,300
yeah,
8:50

2239
01:37:42,310 --> 01:37:43,970
of those fucking coffee shops.
They make you thirsty,

2240
01:37:44,360 --> 01:37:49,360
dude.
That was fucking birthday boys in the 

2241
01:37:50,271 --> 01:37:53,010
room is shit I got peed on today by who?
I grew up.

2242
01:37:53,050 --> 01:37:56,140
We were having sex and she accidentally 
p for first time everyone was

2243
01:37:56,190 --> 01:37:59,490
coming and it was like it felt going 
down my leg.

2244
01:37:59,491 --> 01:37:59,970
I'm like,
wait,

2245
01:37:59,971 --> 01:38:01,020
that's not normal.
And she's like,

2246
01:38:01,021 --> 01:38:02,130
oh my God,
I think it is p.

2247
01:38:02,900 --> 01:38:05,190
If you ever had that happen to you might
be dating the retarded girl.

2248
01:38:05,640 --> 01:38:06,660
No,
she said that.

2249
01:38:06,661 --> 01:38:09,220
She just didn't even know.
Why do you always go?

2250
01:38:10,370 --> 01:38:13,400
I've noticed every time I say something 
you automatically get angry.

2251
01:38:13,430 --> 01:38:16,370
I'm angry.
Retard.

2252
01:38:16,440 --> 01:38:19,020
You say a lot of silly shit and I'm 
making fun of it.

2253
01:38:19,270 --> 01:38:21,390
It's not called defensive.
That's not defense.

2254
01:38:21,400 --> 01:38:22,860
So I pissed on myself.
Good.

2255
01:38:22,861 --> 01:38:26,260
They'd be mad that I'm.
Every time I say something like,

2256
01:38:26,470 --> 01:38:27,870
uh,
anytime I say anything,

2257
01:38:27,871 --> 01:38:29,520
you always get angry,
get angry,

2258
01:38:29,521 --> 01:38:31,230
but you say some ridiculous shit.
Dude.

2259
01:38:31,680 --> 01:38:36,680
What's those pills?
You got a mocking you or clowning at 

2260
01:38:36,680 --> 01:38:40,581
you.
It's like you can't just say ridiculous 

2261
01:38:40,581 --> 01:38:40,581
shit and have me not say anything.

2262
01:38:40,581 --> 01:38:44,690
Yeah,
but a lot of times I say something that 

2263
01:38:44,690 --> 01:38:45,991
you think is ridiculous,
like hash is actually a resin resident 

2264
01:38:45,991 --> 01:38:48,590
residents.
One of the ways they make it as resident

2265
01:38:48,600 --> 01:38:53,600
that's not hash rehashes.
There was a process to make cash that 

2266
01:38:53,600 --> 01:38:56,040
doesn't involve burning it.
Resident is when you scrape a pipe,

2267
01:38:56,190 --> 01:39:00,000
that's what resonance Hash Resin is a 
different process.

2268
01:39:00,001 --> 01:39:03,510
It's not the resident of smoking been 
multiple ways to make it,

2269
01:39:03,511 --> 01:39:06,930
but one of the ways,
one of that ways to make hash is rising.

2270
01:39:07,500 --> 01:39:10,000
One of the ways to make cassius scraping
residence.

2271
01:39:10,830 --> 01:39:15,830
I don't know if that's anything.
Neither one of us know enough about how 

2272
01:39:15,830 --> 01:39:17,180
to make have to assess and shouldn't 
they?

2273
01:39:17,480 --> 01:39:22,480
They take the thc as some somebody 
you're pretending that you don't like 

2274
01:39:22,480 --> 01:39:26,870
say silly shit on purpose,
like you're playing a role and I mock 

2275
01:39:26,870 --> 01:39:26,870
you for it.
Now.

2276
01:39:26,870 --> 01:39:28,710
Also Syria as an example of me staying 
on just saying,

2277
01:39:28,711 --> 01:39:30,090
you're just upset because you love this 
girl,

2278
01:39:30,091 --> 01:39:30,750
and I said she might be.

2279
01:39:30,930 --> 01:39:35,930
I mean I'm just saying in general,
every time I say something you get 

2280
01:39:35,930 --> 01:39:35,930
really angry at me.
Really angry.

2281
01:39:35,930 --> 01:39:37,640
You just noticed it.
I noticed it,

2282
01:39:37,660 --> 01:39:39,360
I noticed that all the time.
Okay.

2283
01:39:39,930 --> 01:39:42,780
I noticed you say ridiculous shit all 
the time and I,

2284
01:39:42,790 --> 01:39:47,790
I clown you for it.
But it doesn't mean that I'm really 

2285
01:39:47,790 --> 01:39:47,790
angry at,
you know,

2286
01:39:47,790 --> 01:39:47,790
I know,
I know.

2287
01:39:47,790 --> 01:39:48,660
But why does it every time I say 
something,

2288
01:39:48,661 --> 01:39:51,990
you always have to completely shut down.
That was barely bashing your girl.

2289
01:39:51,991 --> 01:39:56,991
Pissed all over you.
And I said she had an orgasm and she's 

2290
01:39:56,991 --> 01:40:01,461
never done this before,
but she had the same time and she was 

2291
01:40:01,461 --> 01:40:01,461
like,
whoa,

2292
01:40:01,461 --> 01:40:02,220
this is crazy.
You don't think that it's appropriate to

2293
01:40:02,221 --> 01:40:04,510
say you might be dating retarded girl.
That's a joke.

2294
01:40:04,980 --> 01:40:05,840
That's a joke,
dude.

2295
01:40:05,920 --> 01:40:07,020
Obvious.
I know.

2296
01:40:07,140 --> 01:40:09,280
I liked her girlfriend.
She's a nice person.

2297
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:14,600
What?
You're following the same thing that's 

2298
01:40:14,600 --> 01:40:14,600
wrong with that.
Just,

2299
01:40:14,600 --> 01:40:17,720
you know,
she's your girlfriend about this shit 

2300
01:40:17,720 --> 01:40:17,720
unless you tend to follow what I'm 
saying.

2301
01:40:17,730 --> 01:40:18,840
Nothing wrong with that.
But Brian,

2302
01:40:18,841 --> 01:40:23,841
you can't get the,
the reason why I do this because in the 

2303
01:40:23,841 --> 01:40:28,310
past we've talked about where girls are 
really juicy and we spray that,

2304
01:40:28,311 --> 01:40:30,210
that it.
Is it p or not?

2305
01:40:30,600 --> 01:40:31,440
And uh,
I,

2306
01:40:31,450 --> 01:40:36,450
I actually said no it's not,
I just know girls that have done that 

2307
01:40:36,450 --> 01:40:36,450
before,
but when she did it,

2308
01:40:36,450 --> 01:40:37,580
it felt like she was coming like crazy,
like,

2309
01:40:37,600 --> 01:40:42,600
like I've had experienced before.
But when I smelled it it was 100 

2310
01:40:42,600 --> 01:40:45,921
percent.
So with other girls at squirted it 

2311
01:40:45,921 --> 01:40:46,200
smelled different.
So this time you smelled it,

2312
01:40:46,750 --> 01:40:48,450
smelled it because it was just like,
Whoa,

2313
01:40:48,451 --> 01:40:53,451
why is it all over my asparagus now?
Is there anything else that definitely 

2314
01:40:53,741 --> 01:40:53,980
makes you

2315
01:40:53,980 --> 01:40:55,360
pee?
Smell pineapples,

2316
01:40:55,750 --> 01:40:58,540
pineapples.
It makes it smell good or taste good.

2317
01:40:58,541 --> 01:41:00,010
Your loads.
Pineapples.

2318
01:41:00,140 --> 01:41:01,450
I supposed to make your loads tastes 
good,

2319
01:41:01,660 --> 01:41:04,830
but that's what I hear.
But pee smell a pea.

2320
01:41:04,860 --> 01:41:06,070
It's always asparagus,
right?

2321
01:41:06,100 --> 01:41:07,990
That's the number one thing.
If you thought of,

2322
01:41:08,170 --> 01:41:09,430
like if I said,
what makes you a piece?

2323
01:41:09,431 --> 01:41:12,030
Think you'd say parents,
asparagus.

2324
01:41:12,100 --> 01:41:12,960
There's nothing else.
Right?

2325
01:41:13,210 --> 01:41:16,380
And see vitamin C,
vitamin C,

2326
01:41:16,390 --> 01:41:18,960
that's when it makes it bright orange 
and bright orange.

2327
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:20,960
Well,
all vitamins make your pee bright.

2328
01:41:21,790 --> 01:41:24,570
I mean maybe it is the vitamin C,
Vitamin C,

2329
01:41:24,760 --> 01:41:28,000
is it the more you're dehydrated yellow 
your pis gets yes.

2330
01:41:28,330 --> 01:41:31,390
Or if you have a lot of vitamins,
if you take a lot of vitamins,

2331
01:41:31,480 --> 01:41:32,590
that's why people say,
Oh,

2332
01:41:32,591 --> 01:41:34,270
well you took vitamins,
which comes out in your pee.

2333
01:41:34,450 --> 01:41:39,450
No,
some of it does come on your p and it 

2334
01:41:39,450 --> 01:41:41,260
makes you appear different color,
but a lot of it affects your body in a 

2335
01:41:41,260 --> 01:41:43,891
positive way.
That's one of the weakest arguments 

2336
01:41:43,891 --> 01:41:43,891
ever.
Like you shouldn't take vitamins.

2337
01:41:43,891 --> 01:41:47,461
Just pm out.
I've heard people say that so many 

2338
01:41:47,461 --> 01:41:47,461
times,
Jesus Christ.

2339
01:41:47,461 --> 01:41:50,670
Are you really going into every cell and
monitoring how your nutrients are 

2340
01:41:50,670 --> 01:41:52,510
distributed and you know for sure it all
goes out in your urine.

2341
01:41:52,780 --> 01:41:53,860
You Lazy.
Fuck,

2342
01:41:53,861 --> 01:41:55,780
you're so lazy.
You won't even take vitamins.

2343
01:41:56,140 --> 01:41:57,970
I've talked to so many people like that 
and they say,

2344
01:41:57,971 --> 01:42:02,971
well,
I'd like to take vitamins or just can't 

2345
01:42:02,971 --> 01:42:04,381
be bothered.
Like you can't be bothered to stick a 

2346
01:42:04,381 --> 01:42:04,381
pill in your mouth and drink.
How hard is it?

2347
01:42:04,381 --> 01:42:06,400
You're eating,
you're eating all this food.

2348
01:42:06,460 --> 01:42:11,460
How hard is it to remember to put 
something in your mouth and drink and 

2349
01:42:11,460 --> 01:42:14,131
then you're healthier.
You get nutrients that you're not 

2350
01:42:14,131 --> 01:42:14,131
getting from your diet.

2351
01:42:14,131 --> 01:42:14,330
Things that I do like that all the time.
Then I'm like,

2352
01:42:14,540 --> 01:42:16,400
that's so dumb.
That entity like floss,

2353
01:42:16,401 --> 01:42:18,620
I should like.
I hate flossing the debt,

2354
01:42:18,750 --> 01:42:20,090
but it's so easy.
It takes what,

2355
01:42:20,091 --> 01:42:22,430
two minutes and floss your teeth,
but I can't do it.

2356
01:42:22,550 --> 01:42:24,720
Like my body won't let me floss.
I,

2357
01:42:24,860 --> 01:42:26,590
I tried out for a couple of days and 
then I,

2358
01:42:26,591 --> 01:42:27,590
I just hate it.

2359
01:42:27,670 --> 01:42:32,670
I think we're programmed in a certain 
way by the way we were raised and 

2360
01:42:32,670 --> 01:42:36,481
there's a lot of shit that people got on
you when you were a little kid that you 

2361
01:42:36,481 --> 01:42:39,451
still to this day don't want to fucking 
do because your parents told you to do 

2362
01:42:39,451 --> 01:42:40,240
it.
I have this problem with work,

2363
01:42:40,241 --> 01:42:42,970
man.
I don't like doing things that are work,

2364
01:42:43,060 --> 01:42:48,060
you know,
I don't mind doing things that are for 

2365
01:42:48,060 --> 01:42:48,060
me.
Like I could work forever on.

2366
01:42:48,060 --> 01:42:48,820
Okay.
I can train,

2367
01:42:48,970 --> 01:42:50,650
I can write,
I can,

2368
01:42:50,680 --> 01:42:51,940
you know,
work on things.

2369
01:42:51,941 --> 01:42:54,790
I can draw.
I can work forever on things that I want

2370
01:42:54,791 --> 01:42:59,791
to do,
but if someone tells me I'm supposed to 

2371
01:42:59,791 --> 01:42:59,791
do something,
I have a hard time.

2372
01:42:59,791 --> 01:43:00,820
I have a hard time showing up for things
on time.

2373
01:43:00,821 --> 01:43:05,821
I don't want to.
It's like part of me that wants to 

2374
01:43:05,821 --> 01:43:08,311
resist being on time and part of me that
wants to resist doing work and I know 

2375
01:43:08,311 --> 01:43:09,580
it's from growing up.

2376
01:43:09,760 --> 01:43:11,620
It's from growing up,
being forced to work,

2377
01:43:11,650 --> 01:43:13,090
growing up,
being forced to,

2378
01:43:13,290 --> 01:43:18,290
you know,
like to say that the thought of your 

2379
01:43:18,290 --> 01:43:20,360
work is dreariness and going to work is 
you're going to be miserable and you're 

2380
01:43:20,360 --> 01:43:24,700
gonna have to contain your emotions and 
contain your disdain for what you're 

2381
01:43:24,700 --> 01:43:25,180
doing and just force yourself to follow 
through.

2382
01:43:25,690 --> 01:43:28,270
And I think that's a lot of us.
It's like shit,

2383
01:43:28,271 --> 01:43:30,670
like brushing your teeth.
Brushing teeth is great,

2384
01:43:30,730 --> 01:43:32,410
you know,
but when you're a little kid,

2385
01:43:32,411 --> 01:43:37,411
man,
everybody told you to brush your teeth 

2386
01:43:37,411 --> 01:43:37,411
so it's annoying.
So you're like,

2387
01:43:37,411 --> 01:43:37,411
fuck you.
I'm an adult.

2388
01:43:37,411 --> 01:43:41,880
I'm going to eat.
I'm going to go to sleep with fucking 

2389
01:43:41,880 --> 01:43:41,880
shit stuck in my teeth.
Fuck.

2390
01:43:41,880 --> 01:43:43,850
You know,
you do it on purpose.

2391
01:43:43,851 --> 01:43:48,851
These spite yourself by,
by rebelling from your childhood and 

2392
01:43:48,851 --> 01:43:48,851
Joey.
I mean,

2393
01:43:48,851 --> 01:43:50,560
you grew up in the craziest way 
possible.

2394
01:43:50,710 --> 01:43:52,850
You grew up,
you were sort of taken in by your,

2395
01:43:52,880 --> 01:43:53,990
by your neighbors,
right?

2396
01:43:54,260 --> 01:43:56,690
Yeah,
but when I was 15,

2397
01:43:57,080 --> 01:43:58,420
I come from a house,
get up,

2398
01:43:58,700 --> 01:44:01,370
can I come from a house where my mother 
taught me wants to get in the shower,

2399
01:44:01,371 --> 01:44:03,670
brush my teeth though,
and if not,

2400
01:44:03,740 --> 01:44:05,470
you got to fucking smack to them.
But once you,

2401
01:44:05,520 --> 01:44:08,690
once you've got outta there though.
Once my mother died at 15,

2402
01:44:08,780 --> 01:44:11,660
I moved to the other people,
the neighbors when I met you.

2403
01:44:11,740 --> 01:44:12,280
Right?
This is,

2404
01:44:12,281 --> 01:44:14,030
let me tell you something about when I 
met you,

2405
01:44:14,190 --> 01:44:15,100
you know,
when I met you,

2406
01:44:15,170 --> 01:44:15,560
like,
um,

2407
01:44:15,980 --> 01:44:20,980
you know,
I've known a lot of like wild 

2408
01:44:20,980 --> 01:44:22,040
motherfuckers my whole life and one of 
the things I said,

2409
01:44:22,041 --> 01:44:24,290
I've said this about you on stage.
And it's true.

2410
01:44:24,291 --> 01:44:29,291
Like one of the things I love about 
hanging out with you is that there's a 

2411
01:44:29,291 --> 01:44:32,861
lot of people think there's rules to the
way you're supposed to behave and live 

2412
01:44:32,861 --> 01:44:32,861
and think.

2413
01:44:32,861 --> 01:44:33,670
And then you meet somebody and go,
Hey,

2414
01:44:33,750 --> 01:44:35,290
this guy's not following any rules.
I could say,

2415
01:44:35,330 --> 01:44:36,650
Oh,
I'm going to go follow him for a minute.

2416
01:44:36,770 --> 01:44:37,790
Where you going,
hey,

2417
01:44:37,791 --> 01:44:39,350
where'd you,
where'd you come up with this idea?

2418
01:44:39,440 --> 01:44:40,550
Why are you doing this?
He just,

2419
01:44:40,610 --> 01:44:42,920
he just pulled you dig out.
Are you sure you're going to go to jail?

2420
01:44:42,921 --> 01:44:46,190
You see you smoking pot out in public.
Like there's some people that,

2421
01:44:46,340 --> 01:44:47,420
you know,
when I grew up,

2422
01:44:47,421 --> 01:44:52,421
I grew up very disciplined because I was
a martial arts competitor and my from 

2423
01:44:52,421 --> 01:44:55,760
age 15 to 21 my life,
my life was very,

2424
01:44:55,761 --> 01:44:57,500
very disciplined.
I didn't drink,

2425
01:44:57,650 --> 01:44:59,420
I,
I ate healthy foods.

2426
01:44:59,421 --> 01:45:03,230
I trained all the time and the reason 
why I didn't drink a very rarely I might

2427
01:45:03,231 --> 01:45:07,400
have smoked pot five times in my whole 
life from the time I was like,

2428
01:45:07,401 --> 01:45:10,160
you know,
10 till the time I was like 21,

2429
01:45:10,400 --> 01:45:11,870
maybe six at the most.

2430
01:45:11,960 --> 01:45:16,250
I might've got drunk three or four times
because I was always worried about going

2431
01:45:16,251 --> 01:45:18,410
to the gym the next day and getting 
fucked up.

2432
01:45:18,620 --> 01:45:23,620
I was always worried like if I got drunk
and then four weeks from now I have a 

2433
01:45:23,620 --> 01:45:27,401
fight.
Would if I get my ass kicked in a fight 

2434
01:45:27,401 --> 01:45:27,830
that I would have won,
if I didn't get drunk on that one day,

2435
01:45:27,831 --> 01:45:32,831
I would so I would think like that.
So I was super disciplined and then I 

2436
01:45:32,831 --> 01:45:35,501
met my friend Johnny B and my met my 
friend Johnny when I had gone from being

2437
01:45:35,720 --> 01:45:38,960
a comedian or from from being a fighter 
to being a comedian.

2438
01:45:38,961 --> 01:45:43,961
There was this drastic shift and drastic
shift in the human beings and that was 

2439
01:45:43,961 --> 01:45:47,891
around.
So I was around all these wild 

2440
01:45:47,891 --> 01:45:47,891
motherfuckers,
but they were fighters.

2441
01:45:47,891 --> 01:45:52,360
They were wild motherfuckers who were 
fighting in tournaments and kickboxing 

2442
01:45:52,360 --> 01:45:56,021
and you know,
I knew dudes that would like fight in 

2443
01:45:56,021 --> 01:45:56,021
different tournament's just for a goof.

2444
01:45:56,021 --> 01:45:57,710
I knew dudes that would just go to a 
judo tournament.

2445
01:45:57,711 --> 01:46:00,350
Didn't even practice judo.
They would fight and karate tournaments.

2446
01:46:00,351 --> 01:46:01,930
They weren't karate fighters that were,
you know,

2447
01:46:01,940 --> 01:46:04,250
they were talking about no guys,
they don't just go and just try it out.

2448
01:46:04,251 --> 01:46:08,030
They would do wild dudes who would just 
would take chances and start boxing.

2449
01:46:08,031 --> 01:46:08,930
Yeah.
I've been boxing.

2450
01:46:08,931 --> 01:46:10,940
I'm hanging out with this gym in South 
Boston.

2451
01:46:10,941 --> 01:46:12,290
I started boxing like,
you know,

2452
01:46:12,291 --> 01:46:17,291
this guy started wrestling.
I mean I knew a lot of dudes who did a 

2453
01:46:17,291 --> 01:46:17,450
lot of wild shit,
but it was always wild.

2454
01:46:17,670 --> 01:46:21,590
You like martial arts type shit.
It was crazy and dangerous,

2455
01:46:21,920 --> 01:46:23,390
but it was,
it was a discipline,

2456
01:46:23,391 --> 01:46:28,391
sort of a crazy dangerous.
And then when I started hanging around 

2457
01:46:28,391 --> 01:46:31,181
with Comedians,
then all of a sudden I was hanging out 

2458
01:46:31,181 --> 01:46:32,840
with these wild Fox who are different.
There's a different kind of wild fuck.

2459
01:46:32,990 --> 01:46:37,990
There was like an insecure and needy,
but they would get drunk and fucked up 

2460
01:46:37,990 --> 01:46:39,770
and dudes would do dangerous shit and 
you know,

2461
01:46:39,771 --> 01:46:44,771
it was a weird kind of a human being was
a different kind of human being that I 

2462
01:46:44,771 --> 01:46:47,280
was ever around a lot of partiers,
lot of people doing cocaine,

2463
01:46:47,330 --> 01:46:49,860
people getting nothing.
And then I met my friend Johnny and that

2464
01:46:49,861 --> 01:46:53,130
was the,
the total other end of the craziness.

2465
01:46:53,131 --> 01:46:54,960
I mean,
standup comedy was a craziness,

2466
01:46:55,170 --> 01:46:59,220
but they ain't no crazier than a person 
who's a professional pool hustler.

2467
01:46:59,520 --> 01:47:01,710
And that was my friend Johnny.
My friend Johnny,

2468
01:47:01,740 --> 01:47:03,600
when I met him,
had nowhere to live,

2469
01:47:03,720 --> 01:47:05,490
had nowhere to stay,
did not know where he was,

2470
01:47:05,520 --> 01:47:07,560
he didn't have a diamond is pocket and 
maybe had,

2471
01:47:07,680 --> 01:47:12,680
if he had $5 he was playing someone for 
that $5 and that was all the money he 

2472
01:47:12,680 --> 01:47:12,960
had in the world and he,
you know,

2473
01:47:12,961 --> 01:47:16,110
he played with a house queue or 
sometimes he had his own queue,

2474
01:47:16,440 --> 01:47:21,440
but I mean this dude was living wild,
like completely wild and when I met you 

2475
01:47:22,741 --> 01:47:23,250
and um,
you know,

2476
01:47:23,251 --> 01:47:26,100
he was my friend,
my best friend for years and you know,

2477
01:47:26,310 --> 01:47:29,220
he died and um,
I think it was like shit.

2478
01:47:29,240 --> 01:47:34,240
I v eight somewhere around there.
And I remember when I met you at the 

2479
01:47:34,411 --> 01:47:39,411
comedy store,
I remember meeting you and it was 

2480
01:47:39,411 --> 01:47:40,220
probably around that same year,
somewhere around that same time.

2481
01:47:40,221 --> 01:47:42,250
Yeah.
I remember looking at this motherfucker.

2482
01:47:42,251 --> 01:47:44,670
Here's another one.
Like here's another dude just out there,

2483
01:47:44,671 --> 01:47:49,671
wild in the streets.
You had a pager sometimes you had a 

2484
01:47:49,671 --> 01:47:51,250
pager,
you to pay the whole time.

2485
01:47:51,260 --> 01:47:54,750
The same fucking page.
I got it from J and J dot B dot.

2486
01:47:54,751 --> 01:47:56,160
What year was this?
You got this page?

2487
01:47:56,340 --> 01:48:01,340
Ninety seven and I held onto that page 
until 2004 and that's what fuck these 

2488
01:48:03,721 --> 01:48:07,890
motherfuckers and this stupid rule never
knew where joey was my rules bitch.

2489
01:48:08,370 --> 01:48:11,730
You never knew what joey was and my 
friend Johnny had a page or two.

2490
01:48:11,731 --> 01:48:14,040
That's how you got ahold of him.
But that was back when nobody had a cell

2491
01:48:14,041 --> 01:48:19,041
phone,
but through the all the years of cell 

2492
01:48:19,041 --> 01:48:19,041
phones until we'd never had a cell 
phone.

2493
01:48:19,041 --> 01:48:22,030
Joey didn't get a cell phone until like 
2004 first.

2494
01:48:22,130 --> 01:48:24,070
Jackson,
Spiderman two you've got to fake.

2495
01:48:24,110 --> 01:48:27,540
Talked me into going to get Sam Raimi as
by the man who was like,

2496
01:48:27,570 --> 01:48:27,890
Yo,
Yo,

2497
01:48:27,900 --> 01:48:28,680
yo.
So far.

2498
01:48:29,130 --> 01:48:30,580
Yeah.
Joey didn't have a cell phone.

2499
01:48:30,750 --> 01:48:32,730
He was living on different people's 
couches,

2500
01:48:32,760 --> 01:48:35,160
sleeping in a car until we got code.
Yeah.

2501
01:48:35,220 --> 01:48:37,770
Fucking going on the road with no 
clothes.

2502
01:48:37,771 --> 01:48:40,710
Just fucking living off a fucking 
advances.

2503
01:48:40,711 --> 01:48:42,420
And just.
And by the way,

2504
01:48:42,480 --> 01:48:47,480
by the way,
he's doing comedy back then and he 

2505
01:48:47,480 --> 01:48:47,480
wasn't good.
You weren't good you,

2506
01:48:47,480 --> 01:48:49,380
you were a different comedian man.
You know,

2507
01:48:49,381 --> 01:48:54,381
and I always say that there's never a 
person that I've ever seen make the 

2508
01:48:54,381 --> 01:48:57,210
switch,
flipped the switch and go from a guy who

2509
01:48:57,270 --> 01:49:00,960
wasn't doing well on stage to a guy who 
was just destroyed,

2510
01:49:00,970 --> 01:49:02,730
lost my inhibitions.
I lost,

2511
01:49:03,030 --> 01:49:03,910
but it was amazing.

2512
01:49:03,910 --> 01:49:08,910
It was because one of the things that 
was holding me down was going on my 

2513
01:49:08,910 --> 01:49:11,901
daughter.
It was really holding me down and who I 

2514
01:49:11,901 --> 01:49:11,901
was.
I felt.

2515
01:49:11,901 --> 01:49:12,540
I kept thinking I was doing the role of 
choice,

2516
01:49:13,020 --> 01:49:18,020
so until I committed to doing comedy and
being a broke fucking comic the way you 

2517
01:49:18,181 --> 01:49:20,790
supposed to commit yourself to anything 
you dive into,

2518
01:49:21,120 --> 01:49:26,120
I couldn't be good because I kept 
thinking of a time I was to back to 

2519
01:49:26,120 --> 01:49:27,870
Colorado will be a dad.
That's what I kept thinking.

2520
01:49:27,871 --> 01:49:29,340
I'm like,
I can't be doing this shit.

2521
01:49:29,341 --> 01:49:30,060
I'm like,
Dad,

2522
01:49:30,540 --> 01:49:33,480
but this is what was pulling me.
I had nothing there with my daughter.

2523
01:49:33,780 --> 01:49:38,780
I wanted to raise my daughter my way.
I knew how I was going to raise a 

2524
01:49:38,780 --> 01:49:38,780
daughter.
I was going to raise a daughter that she

2525
01:49:38,780 --> 01:49:39,990
didn't grow up like these fucking dumb 
woman.

2526
01:49:39,991 --> 01:49:42,990
You see that have dignity and they have 
fucking respect the same way.

2527
01:49:42,991 --> 01:49:47,991
My mother,
that's why I don't do what other people 

2528
01:49:47,991 --> 01:49:47,991
do a beat of the drum because that's how
my mother raised me dog

2529
01:49:48,430 --> 01:49:51,640
to beat my own fucking drum if you don't
like something,

2530
01:49:51,641 --> 01:49:54,730
say it and how that wasn't a raise my 
daughter and.

2531
01:49:54,760 --> 01:49:59,760
But the whole time I thought I was going
to come to la and anytime I want to go 

2532
01:49:59,760 --> 01:50:00,310
back and get an apartment of boulders.
I wasn't committed.

2533
01:50:00,520 --> 01:50:04,480
One day I fucking got a thing that you 
wanted to change her name and the mother

2534
01:50:04,481 --> 01:50:08,170
correlate with some bullshit story and 
this and I had to be this nice person.

2535
01:50:08,500 --> 01:50:10,810
I don't like being nice if I don't have 
to bro.

2536
01:50:11,050 --> 01:50:13,660
That's why I've changed so much.
Especially after the blow.

2537
01:50:13,661 --> 01:50:16,360
I don't take nothing from nobody now.
Nothing.

2538
01:50:16,510 --> 01:50:18,910
You can't get away with nothing.
Nothing.

2539
01:50:18,911 --> 01:50:21,610
So will you're saying is because I left 
my inhibitions.

2540
01:50:21,611 --> 01:50:24,840
Go to be a good community you to.
I wasn't committed to it.

2541
01:50:24,910 --> 01:50:26,680
That's what it really was.
Fuck the inhibitions.

2542
01:50:26,890 --> 01:50:29,290
I wasn't committed.
I thought I wanted to be a dad.

2543
01:50:29,291 --> 01:50:31,600
I wanted to be a dad.
I wanted to be a dad,

2544
01:50:31,810 --> 01:50:33,460
but they weren't opening up the door for
me.

2545
01:50:33,461 --> 01:50:35,880
I couldn't run that shit if I didn't 
like.

2546
01:50:35,881 --> 01:50:39,910
What do you mean by the way?
This is where it all goes to right now.

2547
01:50:39,911 --> 01:50:42,280
We're going to straighten this out.
This thing that happened in Denver,

2548
01:50:42,610 --> 01:50:44,620
she threw me out because a lot of people
have been tweeting me.

2549
01:50:44,621 --> 01:50:46,930
What happened for sexual harassment?
What are you talking about?

2550
01:50:46,931 --> 01:50:49,130
The thing with the club,
the comedy works comedy.

2551
01:50:49,630 --> 01:50:54,630
There's a lot of people because most 
people have no idea what you're talking 

2552
01:50:54,630 --> 01:50:54,630
about because last week got a couple 
people asked me what Joey did.

2553
01:50:54,630 --> 01:50:54,870
Here's,
I'll fill you in.

2554
01:50:54,900 --> 01:50:59,900
Joy Diaz has never been able to work 
with me at the comedy works in Denver 

2555
01:50:59,900 --> 01:50:59,900
and people always ask,
when is Joey Diaz?

2556
01:50:59,900 --> 01:51:04,590
Colin,
why can't you bring Joey Diaz at the 

2557
01:51:04,590 --> 01:51:04,590
comedy works?
He has never been allowed to do that.

2558
01:51:04,590 --> 01:51:06,540
Ever since I've been performing.
So she told a bunch of.

2559
01:51:06,541 --> 01:51:08,470
It was the woman who owns the club.
Right.

2560
01:51:08,471 --> 01:51:11,680
And it would have happened with some 
girl ran down and jumped and when I went

2561
01:51:11,681 --> 01:51:16,681
to grab her I grabbed her ass.
There was a kid there that was like in 

2562
01:51:16,681 --> 01:51:20,101
the same league as me.
We're starting to get star spots and he 

2563
01:51:20,101 --> 01:51:20,560
was kind of weird about star spots.
That's what they call them.

2564
01:51:20,561 --> 01:51:22,540
Guest spots.
Comedy works in those days.

2565
01:51:22,541 --> 01:51:25,180
That's when you did Thursday.
You were good enough to do Thursday,

2566
01:51:25,190 --> 01:51:27,340
Wednesday and Tuesday.
And we do like 10 minutes,

2567
01:51:27,380 --> 01:51:28,720
right?
Ten minutes and you get off.

2568
01:51:28,721 --> 01:51:31,180
And Wendy liked me.
Wendy likes Italian guys,

2569
01:51:31,181 --> 01:51:36,181
you know who she likes to?
East Coast and she like rocky whatever 

2570
01:51:36,181 --> 01:51:36,181
the porch.

2571
01:51:36,181 --> 01:51:36,530
She likes those guys.
Right?

2572
01:51:36,700 --> 01:51:39,490
So she kinda liked me and this guy kept 
seeing it.

2573
01:51:39,491 --> 01:51:44,491
And one day I hear that shit.
I'm supposed to open up with George 

2574
01:51:44,491 --> 01:51:44,491
Lopez.
I got a call from Wendy.

2575
01:51:44,491 --> 01:51:46,810
I did sexual harassment,
sexual harassment as well.

2576
01:51:46,860 --> 01:51:49,300
The girl,
what girl came in here.

2577
01:51:49,301 --> 01:51:54,301
So I got the whole story,
but a bunch of comics had seen the girl 

2578
01:51:54,301 --> 01:51:55,740
jump into me and me grab arrest.
We were partying.

2579
01:51:55,750 --> 01:52:00,750
It's like be us being at the store and 
Katie can you and running to you and 

2580
01:52:00,750 --> 01:52:01,900
when she jumps at you grab it.
Right?

2581
01:52:01,970 --> 01:52:03,610
So the girl didn't say nothing that 
night.

2582
01:52:03,670 --> 01:52:08,670
She didn't say nothing.
We kept drinking and we did a couple of 

2583
01:52:08,670 --> 01:52:10,951
lines.
Three days later she was silent with 

2584
01:52:10,951 --> 01:52:11,620
sexual harassment because one of the 
comedians talked her into it.

2585
01:52:12,160 --> 01:52:17,160
He's like building.
That was sexual harassment you should 

2586
01:52:17,160 --> 01:52:17,160
call Wendy.

2587
01:52:17,160 --> 01:52:17,160
So she called.
That's what happened.

2588
01:52:17,290 --> 01:52:19,090
That's all I want.
That's all it was.

2589
01:52:19,180 --> 01:52:21,550
And even at now.
But that's not even what it was.

2590
01:52:21,551 --> 01:52:24,280
That sexual harassment is sexual 
harassment.

2591
01:52:24,281 --> 01:52:26,590
Harassment is whatever you.
What's the definition of it though,

2592
01:52:26,591 --> 01:52:27,350
isn't it?
Well,

2593
01:52:27,370 --> 01:52:30,910
I always assume that it's someone who 
has power over someone and like,

2594
01:52:30,940 --> 01:52:35,940
like a boss that's like saying stupid 
sexual shit to an employee any unwanted.

2595
01:52:37,590 --> 01:52:40,460
The fact that she ran towards and on,
she read souls.

2596
01:52:40,461 --> 01:52:43,030
The thing was that saint can't be sexual
harassment.

2597
01:52:43,090 --> 01:52:44,760
It doesn't really matter.
It doesn't really matter.

2598
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:49,800
Girl,
the fucking buddy told her and when the 

2599
01:52:49,800 --> 01:52:50,320
shit and told me I couldn't come in and 
that,

2600
01:52:51,180 --> 01:52:56,180
you know.
And then you went on the radio and then 

2601
01:52:56,180 --> 01:52:56,180
you signed the radio.
You know what,

2602
01:52:56,180 --> 01:52:57,260
I'm a thief.
I'll fucking shoot you if I have to.

2603
01:52:57,440 --> 01:52:58,580
I'm not a sexual predator.

2604
01:52:58,790 --> 01:53:01,820
So for that fat to say something like 
that is fucking wrong,

2605
01:53:01,821 --> 01:53:06,821
but let me give you the flip side.
She's still stuck with her fat ass and 

2606
01:53:06,821 --> 01:53:06,821
then when I'm here living in my fucking 
life.

2607
01:53:06,821 --> 01:53:11,590
So she did me a favor.
The best thing about what's going on in 

2608
01:53:11,590 --> 01:53:11,990
that was going to kill my ex wife,
my ex wife or husband.

2609
01:53:12,340 --> 01:53:17,340
I was going to kill him.
I was already content to get a fax 

2610
01:53:17,340 --> 01:53:17,960
machine and write jokes for fucking 
Leno.

2611
01:53:18,380 --> 01:53:20,780
They weren't going to present me what 
they were doing for my daughter.

2612
01:53:20,781 --> 01:53:23,510
I was gonna have my buddies chip in $10.
It was 94.

2613
01:53:23,511 --> 01:53:26,210
I wasn't having to get me a fax machine 
that was going to be in jail.

2614
01:53:26,211 --> 01:53:29,120
Writing jokes for them.
I already had a plan and really.

2615
01:53:29,180 --> 01:53:31,100
And one day I actually caught myself 
saying,

2616
01:53:32,210 --> 01:53:37,210
all right,
I'll just kill him because I can't kill 

2617
01:53:37,210 --> 01:53:37,210
her.

2618
01:53:37,210 --> 01:53:37,280
I know what it is to live without a 
fucking mother,

2619
01:53:37,610 --> 01:53:39,050
so I can't kill the mother.
And I said,

2620
01:53:39,070 --> 01:53:39,980
Nah,
just kill him.

2621
01:53:40,460 --> 01:53:42,440
And I went down there one day with a 
fucking butch and I.

2622
01:53:42,450 --> 01:53:46,070
it's just that you don't normally do.
When I get a beef up my hand,

2623
01:53:46,520 --> 01:53:49,370
I took a butcher knife and I smacked him
with two felonies.

2624
01:53:49,670 --> 01:53:51,820
I had two felonies in boulder and he 
caught.

2625
01:53:51,900 --> 01:53:56,900
I picked up my daughter at the daycare.
My daughter got into the car and we're 

2626
01:53:56,900 --> 01:53:56,900
driving and she goes,
Daddy,

2627
01:53:56,900 --> 01:53:57,830
what's a spic?
And I go,

2628
01:53:57,831 --> 01:53:58,880
where'd you hear that?
And she goes,

2629
01:53:58,881 --> 01:54:00,740
whenever you call the house,
that's what John says.

2630
01:54:01,480 --> 01:54:04,430
Close the fucking door.
Those was the Washington speakers.

2631
01:54:04,431 --> 01:54:06,130
I drove with a Safeway member.
You know,

2632
01:54:06,170 --> 01:54:08,090
you'd never go out to the baseline and 
28th street,

2633
01:54:08,120 --> 01:54:11,120
that's where it had a returner.
I used to get my daughter on Sundays and

2634
01:54:11,121 --> 01:54:16,121
Wednesdays,
so there's one Wednesday and pull up my 

2635
01:54:16,121 --> 01:54:16,121
little girl in the car.

2636
01:54:16,121 --> 01:54:16,610
She got a little princess solution 
three,

2637
01:54:16,611 --> 01:54:19,010
maybe four,
get out of the car and I go,

2638
01:54:19,011 --> 01:54:20,180
what did he say?
She goes,

2639
01:54:20,181 --> 01:54:22,100
Spit Daddy.
What does that mean?

2640
01:54:22,930 --> 01:54:25,160
I get out of the car,
I'd go up to my mommy and she something.

2641
01:54:25,161 --> 01:54:30,161
John,
did you say speak in front of my 

2642
01:54:30,161 --> 01:54:30,161
daughter?
And he goes,

2643
01:54:30,161 --> 01:54:30,161
no,
I didn't think.

2644
01:54:30,161 --> 01:54:34,590
Well,
she's three and she's never been to New 

2645
01:54:34,590 --> 01:54:34,590
York.
So you got some explaining to do.

2646
01:54:34,590 --> 01:54:35,030
And he goes,
well,

2647
01:54:35,031 --> 01:54:36,050
I didn't say it Joe.
I go,

2648
01:54:36,051 --> 01:54:36,950
well,
you got a problem.

2649
01:54:37,370 --> 01:54:39,860
Just tell me you said it and we'll end 
this,

2650
01:54:40,190 --> 01:54:42,200
but if you keep sitting there telling me
you didn't say this,

2651
01:54:42,290 --> 01:54:45,050
I'm going to fucking knock you out.
So one more time,

2652
01:54:45,110 --> 01:54:46,720
did you say spic in front of my 
daughter?

2653
01:54:46,730 --> 01:54:47,450
And he said,
no,

2654
01:54:48,080 --> 01:54:50,450
Joe Rogan.
I lick this mother fucked up right there

2655
01:54:50,451 --> 01:54:52,710
in the safeway parking lot with two 
shots to the fuck.

2656
01:54:52,710 --> 01:54:56,510
And then Bam,
but that blind people yell and leave him

2657
01:54:56,511 --> 01:54:57,140
alone.
I'm like,

2658
01:54:57,141 --> 01:54:59,870
fuck you bitch.
And all this.

2659
01:55:00,170 --> 01:55:02,350
In the middle of all this,
I turn around and look at the client.

2660
01:55:02,360 --> 01:55:04,350
I said,
my little three year old princess bride.

2661
01:55:05,240 --> 01:55:10,240
She was scared when I was five and six.
I see my stepdad blast motherfuckers 

2662
01:55:11,151 --> 01:55:16,151
with your flapping hands on the street.
I seen him shoot a gun on 48th street 

2663
01:55:16,151 --> 01:55:17,180
and I would say to me,
I was raised.

2664
01:55:17,181 --> 01:55:22,181
I was a fucking animal.
I didn't want my daughter to go through 

2665
01:55:22,181 --> 01:55:23,180
that barrow at this time already.
She was already seeing this shit.

2666
01:55:23,480 --> 01:55:25,610
Now I smacked his fucking dude I had to 
go to.

2667
01:55:26,030 --> 01:55:29,720
They didn't give me a ticket because if 
you check bold and next time you go.

2668
01:55:31,070 --> 01:55:36,070
If you use a racial epithet and the city
limits of bold that you got get what's 

2669
01:55:36,070 --> 01:55:36,070
coming to you.

2670
01:55:36,070 --> 01:55:36,380
Really?
Yeah.

2671
01:55:36,500 --> 01:55:38,600
So when there's something,
cause he called you a Spec,

2672
01:55:38,601 --> 01:55:43,601
you were allowed to beat him.
My one clean when he went to court the 

2673
01:55:43,601 --> 01:55:43,890
next day with the black eye according to
the judge even said,

2674
01:55:44,760 --> 01:55:47,190
next time you call somebody a fucking 
racial epitaph,

2675
01:55:47,220 --> 01:55:48,980
you got won't come at all because ofj 
dot j.

2676
01:55:48,990 --> 01:55:50,420
Dot Flannigan.
Nineteen 87.

2677
01:55:50,421 --> 01:55:55,421
A football player in the early,
in the late eighties that a lot of 

2678
01:55:55,421 --> 01:55:55,421
problems in boulder with the black 
football players.

2679
01:55:55,421 --> 01:56:00,320
They were up there fucking those white 
chicks three at a time banging them j 

2680
01:56:00,320 --> 01:56:02,040
dot j Dot Flanagan,
Kuneva Mcgee,

2681
01:56:02,430 --> 01:56:07,430
and one kid says something.
The Jj flank called him a nigger and he 

2682
01:56:07,430 --> 01:56:07,430
smacked him.
The kids.

2683
01:56:07,430 --> 01:56:09,000
I fucking flew up.
Kids fucking.

2684
01:56:09,090 --> 01:56:13,140
I flew out of his fucking head.
I flew out of his fucking head.

2685
01:56:13,141 --> 01:56:18,141
So something happened after that.
They made it the judge j Dot j Dot 

2686
01:56:18,141 --> 01:56:19,380
Flannigan law that you can't say a 
racial epitaphs.

2687
01:56:19,380 --> 01:56:22,680
They sided with him in the city of 
Lynwood inside with him,

2688
01:56:22,681 --> 01:56:24,960
but some fucking word man.
Yeah,

2689
01:56:24,961 --> 01:56:25,890
I agree.
Don't say it.

2690
01:56:25,891 --> 01:56:29,230
It's not nice,
but that's the knocked out.

2691
01:56:29,270 --> 01:56:34,270
At the time I was going to kill my ex 
wife and her fucking boyfriend at one 

2692
01:56:34,270 --> 01:56:38,211
side of me at the time.
I'm going to kill these motherfuckers 

2693
01:56:38,211 --> 01:56:38,211
joined.
I'm telling you,

2694
01:56:38,211 --> 01:56:38,580
this is sincerity of my heart.
Everybody.

2695
01:56:38,730 --> 01:56:40,980
Nobody was going to fuck with me.
That's the way my mother raised me.

2696
01:56:41,010 --> 01:56:43,320
So this is after he called you a Spec.
You want him to kill him?

2697
01:56:43,560 --> 01:56:46,380
I was still gonna hunt them down.
I still had a plan for hunt them down.

2698
01:56:46,381 --> 01:56:47,670
I was in a hunt him down.
I was.

2699
01:56:47,890 --> 01:56:49,680
So what was going on though?
You're white.

2700
01:56:49,681 --> 01:56:53,430
You broke up with your wife and my wife 
broke up and then this new guy came in,

2701
01:56:53,431 --> 01:56:55,890
the pit them against my wishes on 
whatnot.

2702
01:56:56,160 --> 01:56:57,930
She told me she wasn't going to date.
Nobody for me.

2703
01:56:57,931 --> 01:56:58,800
Not to date,
nobody.

2704
01:56:58,801 --> 01:57:03,801
I got into comedy and then one day she 
came to me when I was at a conference 

2705
01:57:03,801 --> 01:57:07,371
with the broker and she goes,
I was late for hours because I had a 

2706
01:57:07,371 --> 01:57:10,581
date and that's how the war started and 
she moved my daughter in there and 

2707
01:57:10,581 --> 01:57:10,950
here's how the war started.
White come from.

2708
01:57:10,951 --> 01:57:12,850
You can't move my daughter into 
somewhere though,

2709
01:57:13,750 --> 01:57:15,630
some man's house.
She,

2710
01:57:15,870 --> 01:57:20,870
if she's with your daughter,
you think she should have been by 

2711
01:57:20,870 --> 01:57:20,870
herself forever?
No,

2712
01:57:20,870 --> 01:57:21,870
you come to me and talk to me like a 
man,

2713
01:57:22,110 --> 01:57:24,660
you're going to move my daughter into 
another man's house.

2714
01:57:25,630 --> 01:57:28,920
Understand me.
That I don't give me the tricky.

2715
01:57:29,110 --> 01:57:29,620
No,
no,

2716
01:57:29,630 --> 01:57:29,830
no,
no,

2717
01:57:29,831 --> 01:57:30,690
no.
It's not tricky.

2718
01:57:30,840 --> 01:57:35,840
That's my daughter.
I paid child support before you move 

2719
01:57:35,840 --> 01:57:38,361
into another motherfuckers house.
Don't say tricky because if it happens 

2720
01:57:38,361 --> 01:57:38,430
to you,
you understand the feeling,

2721
01:57:38,500 --> 01:57:43,500
still triggered all know the feeling and
when you pick up your and that was like 

2722
01:57:43,500 --> 01:57:43,740
another man so nobody could judge me on 
this.

2723
01:57:43,830 --> 01:57:46,560
Nobody.
I don't ever want to hear it from nobody

2724
01:57:46,590 --> 01:57:51,590
knows until you know that feeling.
Don't you ever say nothing to me ever 

2725
01:57:51,590 --> 01:57:55,730
until you know the feeling when you pick
up your fucking daughter and she smells 

2726
01:57:55,730 --> 01:57:55,730
like another man.
Joe,

2727
01:57:55,730 --> 01:57:57,480
I'm sure somebody can say something to 
me,

2728
01:57:58,080 --> 01:58:00,670
but until then,
don't ever say something like that.

2729
01:58:00,680 --> 01:58:02,460
But this woman is allowed to live her 
life.

2730
01:58:02,730 --> 01:58:04,060
She's a lot to live her life,
so she.

2731
01:58:04,061 --> 01:58:09,061
You think she's got to get your 
permission before she came in with a 

2732
01:58:09,061 --> 01:58:11,690
man?
What are you especially is raising the 

2733
01:58:11,690 --> 01:58:11,690
girls.
That's where it gets tricky.

2734
01:58:11,690 --> 01:58:12,030
Support.
You were fucking joint.

2735
01:58:12,090 --> 01:58:14,670
So what does that mean?
Joint fucking custody.

2736
01:58:14,671 --> 01:58:17,740
You still cost money to raise the kid 
and she lives with a guy constantly.

2737
01:58:17,850 --> 01:58:19,620
I understand,
but I'm paying child support.

2738
01:58:19,670 --> 01:58:21,420
What?
I don't know how that works.

2739
01:58:22,050 --> 01:58:27,050
What do you mean a woman can not just 
moving your daughter's room with a man 

2740
01:58:27,050 --> 01:58:27,050
is illegal.

2741
01:58:27,050 --> 01:58:27,450
It's it.
It's us.

2742
01:58:28,190 --> 01:58:31,140
You just can't wake up one day and your 
daughter moves a fucking.

2743
01:58:31,180 --> 01:58:33,460
What is her?
What are her rights or her legal?

2744
01:58:33,540 --> 01:58:34,530
No,
I didn't quote Perry.

2745
01:58:34,531 --> 01:58:35,580
Mason.
I,

2746
01:58:35,640 --> 01:58:40,640
I'm,
I'm from the street of rights to come 

2747
01:58:40,640 --> 01:58:40,640
through like a man.
But you know what I'm saying?

2748
01:58:40,640 --> 01:58:44,181
Joey,
if she doesn't want to deal with you 

2749
01:58:44,181 --> 01:58:45,501
anymore,
if she doesn't want to deal with you 

2750
01:58:45,501 --> 01:58:45,501
anymore,
she wants a minute ago with the guy,

2751
01:58:45,501 --> 01:58:49,460
she has to get your permission.
You want to do whatever the fuck you 

2752
01:58:49,460 --> 01:58:50,320
want to do.
You do the fuck you want to do,

2753
01:58:50,560 --> 01:58:53,470
but you can't take your daughter into 
some other woman's house will.

2754
01:58:53,471 --> 01:58:54,940
I've seen that woman and saying,
Hey,

2755
01:58:55,750 --> 01:58:58,720
I got a woman and I want to.
That's all I'm asking from anybody.

2756
01:58:59,170 --> 01:59:00,820
That's it just commonly looked at me in 
the eye.

2757
01:59:00,821 --> 01:59:01,870
Don't give me no bullshit,
bro.

2758
01:59:01,870 --> 01:59:06,870
This is what men don't tell me.
You asked somebody if your daughter and 

2759
01:59:06,870 --> 01:59:10,861
your wife are going to move in with a 
guy right now when you want to come to 

2760
01:59:10,861 --> 01:59:11,680
you and the Lord Christ.
Joey,

2761
01:59:11,710 --> 01:59:16,710
what are you?
You're getting in an argument with 

2762
01:59:16,710 --> 01:59:16,710
someone who's not even.
I'm arguing with society.

2763
01:59:16,710 --> 01:59:17,170
I understand.
That's what I'm saying.

2764
01:59:17,171 --> 01:59:18,810
It's hard to listen to the saying to me 
that,

2765
01:59:19,970 --> 01:59:21,130
yeah,
you get crazy right?

2766
01:59:21,840 --> 01:59:25,750
A woman has a right to be away from my 
man and what is she going to go?

2767
01:59:25,820 --> 01:59:27,910
She's raising a kid out less.
You got to.

2768
01:59:27,970 --> 01:59:32,970
When you.
When a woman wants to leave another 

2769
01:59:32,970 --> 01:59:32,970
Dick,
that's one thing.

2770
01:59:32,970 --> 01:59:34,480
You don't have to tell me nothing.
You're moving your daughter.

2771
01:59:34,780 --> 01:59:36,330
She's three or four.
You got to come.

2772
01:59:36,490 --> 01:59:36,860
Well,
I.

2773
01:59:36,861 --> 01:59:41,861
I agree that it's got to be a very hairy
situation to have some man around your 

2774
01:59:41,861 --> 01:59:46,081
child,
especially when you know that he's 

2775
01:59:46,081 --> 01:59:47,971
talking some shit about you and he's was
raising your daughters terrible before 

2776
01:59:48,120 --> 01:59:49,780
somebody moves.

2777
01:59:49,850 --> 01:59:53,530
You're kidding with another person.
They should contact you and say,

2778
01:59:53,531 --> 01:59:55,780
Hey,
I fell in love with somebody.

2779
01:59:55,781 --> 02:00:00,781
I want to move my kid in there,
but most women make the mistake when 

2780
02:00:00,781 --> 02:00:03,601
they get separated,
the jump in the sack with somebody just 

2781
02:00:03,601 --> 02:00:03,700
to hurt the other person.
I've seen it a thousand times.

2782
02:00:03,740 --> 02:00:08,740
Do you think that's why they do it?
They just know they do it because they 

2783
02:00:08,740 --> 02:00:08,740
want to jump into bed with somebody that
you know,

2784
02:00:08,920 --> 02:00:11,120
think about all the time.
Look at what happened with being candid.

2785
02:00:11,130 --> 02:00:14,220
His wife jumped into bed with Zulu 
nation and he fucked cane.

2786
02:00:14,590 --> 02:00:19,590
What?
Dean Kane came home one day and he 

2787
02:00:19,590 --> 02:00:19,590
didn't know who the fuck knows this 
story?

2788
02:00:19,590 --> 02:00:19,590
Well,
I'm telling you were right.

2789
02:00:19,590 --> 02:00:20,140
He's like,
it's like,

2790
02:00:20,150 --> 02:00:20,920
no.
Come on.

2791
02:00:20,921 --> 02:00:23,650
Everybody knows the dean,
George Washington,

2792
02:00:23,651 --> 02:00:26,700
the apple tree details Zulu nation.
He came home one day.

2793
02:00:26,740 --> 02:00:28,810
Christmas had moved the kid in with 
another guy.

2794
02:00:29,560 --> 02:00:34,560
You know,
he came home and the wife had moved the 

2795
02:00:34,560 --> 02:00:34,560
kid and with another guy and whatever 
the fuck.

2796
02:00:34,560 --> 02:00:38,701
You know what I'm saying?
They were separated and she moved in 

2797
02:00:38,701 --> 02:00:38,701
with another fucking guy.
He did the same thing.

2798
02:00:38,701 --> 02:00:39,970
He took the bits of the court and took a
fucking jeep.

2799
02:00:40,210 --> 02:00:41,650
You did everything.
You cannot.

2800
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:44,180
You have to come to me though with 
without the court.

2801
02:00:44,181 --> 02:00:45,970
So that's the.
That's the problem where I lacked.

2802
02:00:45,971 --> 02:00:47,890
I don't understand court.
I don't understand.

2803
02:00:47,891 --> 02:00:48,640
Cool.
We're friends.

2804
02:00:48,790 --> 02:00:53,790
Don't hit me with court.
I know you're 20 years used to suck my 

2805
02:00:53,790 --> 02:00:53,790
dick and I used to eat your ass.
Whoa.

2806
02:00:53,790 --> 02:00:56,280
Whoa.
You don't have to go to cloud.

2807
02:00:56,640 --> 02:01:01,240
Have a relationship with this man.
I'm missing what I'm trying to say.

2808
02:01:01,410 --> 02:01:06,410
She's had a good time with Joe.
Did assistant position at this time in 

2809
02:01:06,410 --> 02:01:07,070
my life.
When did that favor by banning me.

2810
02:01:07,900 --> 02:01:10,270
She doesn't mean she made you leave 
Denver.

2811
02:01:10,550 --> 02:01:12,550
She took me a fucking favor.
Look where I am now,

2812
02:01:12,551 --> 02:01:14,790
but you fucking mom was smoking dope.
Not Good.

2813
02:01:14,830 --> 02:01:17,050
Dope.
But I'm having a good fucking time.

2814
02:01:17,140 --> 02:01:22,140
The reason this,
this crazy fucking argument with nobody 

2815
02:01:22,140 --> 02:01:25,230
just got started.
The story got started because of the 

2816
02:01:25,230 --> 02:01:25,230
paramount.
Bob,

2817
02:01:25,230 --> 02:01:26,210
I'm just telling you the truth.
September 23rd paramount there.

2818
02:01:26,350 --> 02:01:28,940
Joe Diaz returns to out there.
Say,

2819
02:01:28,990 --> 02:01:30,870
hurry up.
It's almost so bad.

2820
02:01:30,930 --> 02:01:33,130
Oh Joe,
you asked me what was going on.

2821
02:01:33,640 --> 02:01:38,640
You asked me and I'm telling you I 
didn't know that we're going to fuck 

2822
02:01:38,640 --> 02:01:42,481
around with people you want to know.
I tell the St Joe jokey pools or 

2823
02:01:42,481 --> 02:01:45,741
nothing.
She'll keep it match what happened with 

2824
02:01:45,741 --> 02:01:45,741
me.
So when they came to me and said you got

2825
02:01:45,741 --> 02:01:48,590
thrown out of the end of economy was I 
was bummed out for like two weeks,

2826
02:01:48,950 --> 02:01:53,950
but I knew I was losing the war over 
there because I wasn't going to lose 

2827
02:01:53,950 --> 02:01:53,950
that.

2828
02:01:53,950 --> 02:01:55,740
Glad you never killed anybody want to 
come back with a hand?

2829
02:01:55,800 --> 02:01:59,700
Was there any kind of love interest 
between you and Wendy at any time?

2830
02:01:59,730 --> 02:02:00,690
No.
You sure?

2831
02:02:00,960 --> 02:02:02,040
Did you ever kiss her?
No.

2832
02:02:02,480 --> 02:02:05,140
Nothing because that's what I heard.
I heard that there was some kindness and

2833
02:02:05,160 --> 02:02:06,220
you didn't hear that.
Did you hear that?

2834
02:02:07,350 --> 02:02:09,900
He's been in fucking jail.
I wonder when people yell at,

2835
02:02:09,901 --> 02:02:11,100
you know,
I swear to God.

2836
02:02:11,340 --> 02:02:13,210
I swear to God though.
What'd you hear?

2837
02:02:13,680 --> 02:02:18,680
I heard that,
that they were like kind of fucking 

2838
02:02:18,680 --> 02:02:19,890
around with each other.
I don't know who told me,

2839
02:02:20,070 --> 02:02:21,340
but somebody told me,
you told you.

2840
02:02:21,440 --> 02:02:22,950
Nobody told him that.
He's just trying to.

2841
02:02:22,980 --> 02:02:24,680
You?
No I don't.

2842
02:02:24,990 --> 02:02:26,400
He's not going nowhere with it.
Stop.

2843
02:02:26,460 --> 02:02:27,820
It's not cute.
It ain't gonna fuck.

2844
02:02:27,930 --> 02:02:30,330
I swear to you.
Make it funny.

2845
02:02:30,780 --> 02:02:33,310
What are you still people at Rogen on?
You ain't even funny.

2846
02:02:33,311 --> 02:02:35,140
Stop it.
Stop it.

2847
02:02:35,970 --> 02:02:40,970
People are explaining me.
Hash online and there's nothing more 

2848
02:02:40,970 --> 02:02:43,941
than compressed keef or thc extracted 
from plant material says high tech con 

2849
02:02:45,481 --> 02:02:50,481
man.
People are also telling me that there's 

2850
02:02:50,481 --> 02:02:51,650
many different kinds of Hash tricombs 
and yeah,

2851
02:02:51,690 --> 02:02:53,610
I guess some people actually do call it 
resin.

2852
02:02:53,790 --> 02:02:56,430
It's not resonate as a.
I understand resin I think.

2853
02:02:56,431 --> 02:02:56,810
I think.
Yeah,

2854
02:02:57,830 --> 02:03:00,970
tell them about the shit that I was 
getting with the fucking stamp.

2855
02:03:01,180 --> 02:03:03,430
Hello?
Knows about that shit.

2856
02:03:03,640 --> 02:03:05,350
It's just like,
it's just like the Olympic

2857
02:03:05,380 --> 02:03:07,090
fixed.
They would stamp it with like,

2858
02:03:07,091 --> 02:03:12,091
you know,
it would be like the medium grade would 

2859
02:03:12,091 --> 02:03:12,091
be bronze,
medium will be serving the best would be

2860
02:03:12,091 --> 02:03:13,000
like Goldman.
They used to have them.

2861
02:03:13,001 --> 02:03:18,001
I have a platinum coding,
so that's how you judge Hash in the old 

2862
02:03:18,001 --> 02:03:18,001
days when you got it,
people would say,

2863
02:03:18,001 --> 02:03:18,610
oh yeah,
fucking platinum.

2864
02:03:18,611 --> 02:03:20,460
You can't get no that.
So that's,

2865
02:03:20,490 --> 02:03:21,850
that's the emperor.
I'm not kidding.

2866
02:03:22,170 --> 02:03:23,770
These are jokes.
The emperor,

2867
02:03:23,790 --> 02:03:26,110
wherever it would make the hash,
before they shipped it over here,

2868
02:03:26,320 --> 02:03:31,320
they would stamp it for your approval 
and that's what you always wanted to 

2869
02:03:31,320 --> 02:03:34,171
get.
You always wanted to get the hash with 

2870
02:03:34,171 --> 02:03:34,171
the stamp.

2871
02:03:34,171 --> 02:03:34,171
What I was talking about earlier,
Oklahoma,

2872
02:03:34,171 --> 02:03:38,410
Oklahoma Senate approves life in prison 
for making hash of you make Hash.

2873
02:03:39,021 --> 02:03:42,080
They will give you life in prison.
That's amazing.

2874
02:03:42,550 --> 02:03:45,140
It's amazing how stupid they are in 
Oklahoma.

2875
02:03:45,440 --> 02:03:48,800
That is so fucking dumb.
They think that somehow or another,

2876
02:03:48,801 --> 02:03:51,590
this is some dangerous drug.
Who Do they think this is math?

2877
02:03:51,620 --> 02:03:53,660
What do you get from making meth in 
Oklahoma?

2878
02:03:53,900 --> 02:03:57,800
Because if you get life in jail for if 
you get life in jail for making hash,

2879
02:03:57,950 --> 02:04:00,050
they should shoot everyone you've ever 
met.

2880
02:04:00,051 --> 02:04:05,051
If you make meth,
they should kill you and then shoot 

2881
02:04:05,051 --> 02:04:07,350
everyone you've ever met.
Everyone you love should die for shut.

2882
02:04:07,360 --> 02:04:12,360
The Hash has never killed anybody.
The only times I was smoking hash and 

2883
02:04:12,360 --> 02:04:12,360
I'm like,
I've just said,

2884
02:04:12,360 --> 02:04:12,950
wow,
I'm really high.

2885
02:04:13,100 --> 02:04:13,550
That's it.

2886
02:04:14,080 --> 02:04:16,660
Hash is really good.
If you work at your store,

2887
02:04:17,070 --> 02:04:19,510
you eat little pieces of it.
Oh God.

2888
02:04:19,511 --> 02:04:21,160
The next day you wake up,
often

2889
02:04:21,490 --> 02:04:26,490
there's a beautiful fucking story on a 
kid who had autism and his parents were 

2890
02:04:26,490 --> 02:04:28,720
given them hash and it killed his 
autism.

2891
02:04:28,900 --> 02:04:33,900
It's amazing.
The kid like wouldn't interact with 

2892
02:04:33,900 --> 02:04:33,900
anybody.
The black chicks I did.

2893
02:04:33,900 --> 02:04:33,900
No,
no,

2894
02:04:33,900 --> 02:04:33,900
no.
It was a different one.

2895
02:04:34,120 --> 02:04:39,120
So different was a white kid.
It was a guy in northern California and 

2896
02:04:39,120 --> 02:04:41,701
he cut a little tiny piece of hash and 
he would stick it inside of a melon and 

2897
02:04:41,701 --> 02:04:45,741
he would give it to his boy and all the 
sudden this kid was interacting with 

2898
02:04:45,741 --> 02:04:46,890
people and he was calm.
He was relaxed and there was another one

2899
02:04:46,891 --> 02:04:49,170
with a black kid to where they're given 
a medical marijuana.

2900
02:04:50,190 --> 02:04:51,450
Meanwhile,
in Oklahoma,

2901
02:04:51,451 --> 02:04:55,080
that's shit puts you in life.
In prison in April 20.

2902
02:04:55,081 --> 02:04:58,580
First of 2011.
That's an Oklahoma.

2903
02:04:58,610 --> 02:05:01,740
So not anymore.
Not Anymore.

2904
02:05:02,090 --> 02:05:04,850
There's certain places where somebody 
else might.

2905
02:05:04,851 --> 02:05:07,050
They got to get this test for welfare.
I like it.

2906
02:05:07,320 --> 02:05:09,430
That's a good move.
That's a fucking bull.

2907
02:05:10,260 --> 02:05:15,260
Welfare is such a tricky thing because I
love the idea that people can count on 

2908
02:05:15,810 --> 02:05:18,060
people to help them out if something 
goes wrong,

2909
02:05:18,210 --> 02:05:21,450
but human nature is a motherfucker and 
human nature is.

2910
02:05:21,451 --> 02:05:23,890
If you give people the ability to not 
work there,

2911
02:05:24,030 --> 02:05:24,960
they're going to take it.

2912
02:05:27,540 --> 02:05:30,050
I never understood.
People went there and said,

2913
02:05:30,051 --> 02:05:33,750
I claimed craziness.
That's $600 a month so you don't have to

2914
02:05:33,751 --> 02:05:35,460
work and you're crazy.
You're getting $6.

2915
02:05:36,090 --> 02:05:38,910
You can't live on that,
so I don't understand why you're jumping

2916
02:05:38,911 --> 02:05:43,911
up and down so happy for.
Some people are happy just to know a 

2917
02:05:43,911 --> 02:05:45,180
month or something.
I just seen him about a year ago on TV.

2918
02:05:45,390 --> 02:05:50,390
If you claim craziest 6:40
and those people in that documentary I 

2919
02:05:50,390 --> 02:05:52,950
was talking about earlier were 
documentaries that I think we're alone.

2920
02:05:53,130 --> 02:05:56,360
How they made their money.
They claim crazy.

2921
02:05:56,361 --> 02:06:01,361
Yeah.
Well because they're not claiming it 

2922
02:06:01,361 --> 02:06:01,361
because they had that asperger's or 
whatever it's called asperger's.

2923
02:06:01,361 --> 02:06:02,740
You can get money from you.
Look,

2924
02:06:02,820 --> 02:06:07,820
I think you should be able to get some 
money if there's something fucked up 

2925
02:06:07,820 --> 02:06:07,820
with you and we should help each other 
out.

2926
02:06:07,820 --> 02:06:09,120
We should help out our brothers and 
sisters.

2927
02:06:09,360 --> 02:06:12,090
The problem is,
like I said about hippies.

2928
02:06:12,210 --> 02:06:14,850
The problem is it's beautiful if 
everybody helps.

2929
02:06:14,851 --> 02:06:19,851
If you've got a circle and everybody's 
handing out love to the left and like 

2930
02:06:19,851 --> 02:06:20,070
man,
here have some live,

2931
02:06:20,071 --> 02:06:21,570
it's going to come around back to you.
It's all.

2932
02:06:21,571 --> 02:06:22,650
We're all community,
right?

2933
02:06:22,920 --> 02:06:27,920
But with hippies,
a lot of hippies when they're in a 

2934
02:06:27,920 --> 02:06:27,920
circle and they're handing out love to 
the left,

2935
02:06:27,920 --> 02:06:32,391
the love gets to them and they step out 
of the circle and walk away and they 

2936
02:06:32,391 --> 02:06:35,070
take that love and they don't pass it 
around and they're always taking and not

2937
02:06:35,071 --> 02:06:38,550
giving and that's something that happens
when you have a welfare situation.

2938
02:06:38,850 --> 02:06:41,850
You have people who.
It's nice if we all help each other out,

2939
02:06:42,090 --> 02:06:47,090
but some people just,
they're greedy and they take that money 

2940
02:06:47,090 --> 02:06:50,721
and they just.
They think that somehow or another 

2941
02:06:50,721 --> 02:06:50,721
deserve it and other people,
they use it as a crutch.

2942
02:06:50,721 --> 02:06:54,520
Well,
I don't have to work because now I got 

2943
02:06:54,520 --> 02:06:55,881
money.
There's so many flaws in human beings 

2944
02:06:55,881 --> 02:06:58,170
and and just just human behavior.
It's hard to make something like welfare

2945
02:06:58,171 --> 02:07:03,171
work.
It's hard to make it work the way it's 

2946
02:07:03,171 --> 02:07:03,171
supposed to work.
Here's the way it's supposed to work,

2947
02:07:03,171 --> 02:07:07,731
right?
Here's the way society is supposed to 

2948
02:07:07,731 --> 02:07:09,651
work.
We are supposed to live in tribes of 50 

2949
02:07:09,651 --> 02:07:10,170
people.
That's how it's supposed to work.

2950
02:07:10,320 --> 02:07:15,320
We're not supposed to be connected.
Three hundred fucking million of us all 

2951
02:07:15,320 --> 02:07:17,780
on this one patch of dirt.
That is pro postures.

2952
02:07:18,060 --> 02:07:23,060
The idea of a fucking community that has
300 million people have it is 

2953
02:07:23,060 --> 02:07:24,800
ridiculous,
especially when people go on Rob,

2954
02:07:24,801 --> 02:07:26,640
rob,
bullshit and fuck you.

2955
02:07:26,670 --> 02:07:28,200
So you will say,
no,

2956
02:07:28,230 --> 02:07:28,590
no,
no,

2957
02:07:28,591 --> 02:07:29,030
no.
That's.

2958
02:07:29,200 --> 02:07:31,500
That's crazy.
You can't have everybody in.

2959
02:07:31,501 --> 02:07:34,140
You can't have everybody in the same 
fucking team.

2960
02:07:34,141 --> 02:07:37,210
It's not that you shouldn't be one 
community in your community,

2961
02:07:37,211 --> 02:07:38,980
should compete against every other 
community.

2962
02:07:39,070 --> 02:07:41,530
You could all have be under the same 
idea,

2963
02:07:41,531 --> 02:07:46,531
our umbrella,
but the fact that all people are 

2964
02:07:46,531 --> 02:07:46,531
responsible for all the rest of the 
people,

2965
02:07:46,531 --> 02:07:47,590
$300,
million,

2966
02:07:47,860 --> 02:07:49,750
it's too many.
There's too many.

2967
02:07:49,870 --> 02:07:54,870
There's too much room for craziness and 
douchebags and too much neglect and 

2968
02:07:54,870 --> 02:07:56,350
there's not enough people that are good 
enough focus or attention.

2969
02:07:56,530 --> 02:07:59,710
It's just the numbers are too vast for a
human being,

2970
02:07:59,890 --> 02:08:02,830
a human being belongs in a tribe of 
small people,

2971
02:08:03,100 --> 02:08:07,000
but the fact that there's so many of us 
are a small tribe of 50 people,

2972
02:08:07,060 --> 02:08:12,060
but the fact that so many of us that we 
kind of are forced into this situation 

2973
02:08:12,060 --> 02:08:16,141
where we interact on a daily basis with 
millions of people that we have no idea 

2974
02:08:16,141 --> 02:08:20,221
who the fuck they are.
We don't know anything about them and 

2975
02:08:20,221 --> 02:08:20,221
yet we're all combined under the same 
group.

2976
02:08:20,221 --> 02:08:20,800
That's crazy.

2977
02:08:20,800 --> 02:08:23,920
That's when welfare becomes nuts because
you're getting money from some people.

2978
02:08:23,921 --> 02:08:25,090
You don't even fucking know these 
people.

2979
02:08:25,091 --> 02:08:26,770
Fuck those people.
Give me my money.

2980
02:08:26,980 --> 02:08:31,980
You know?
Instead of being in a tribe of 50 

2981
02:08:31,980 --> 02:08:31,980
people,
they go,

2982
02:08:31,980 --> 02:08:31,980
hey man,
why aren't you doing your work?

2983
02:08:31,980 --> 02:08:33,730
You need to contribute.
We're a part of a community.

2984
02:08:33,820 --> 02:08:35,840
And then you feel it.
You feel that your.

2985
02:08:35,850 --> 02:08:37,120
Yeah,
I am slacking.

2986
02:08:37,240 --> 02:08:42,240
Yeah.
If there was 10 people on an island and 

2987
02:08:42,240 --> 02:08:42,240
one person was sitting around,
you know,

2988
02:08:42,240 --> 02:08:44,040
if they all got shipwrecked and one 
person was sitting around going,

2989
02:08:44,080 --> 02:08:45,870
yeah,
bring me my fish year,

2990
02:08:45,880 --> 02:08:46,870
where's my water?
You'd go,

2991
02:08:46,871 --> 02:08:48,550
we got to kill that guy.
That guy's not using.

2992
02:08:48,580 --> 02:08:49,600
He's not helping.
You know,

2993
02:08:49,601 --> 02:08:54,601
he's using up our valuable resources.
We have to risk our lives fishing and 

2994
02:08:54,601 --> 02:08:55,270
getting water and this just sits around 
doing.

2995
02:08:55,360 --> 02:09:00,360
You'd want to kill him,
but in a society with 300 million 

2996
02:09:00,360 --> 02:09:03,331
people,
it just becomes another thing you just 

2997
02:09:03,331 --> 02:09:03,331
told me.
Do you know how easy

2998
02:09:03,450 --> 02:09:05,700
they make it for you?
I don't know about now,

2999
02:09:05,880 --> 02:09:09,300
but because what's going on?
But you know how easy they make it.

3000
02:09:09,301 --> 02:09:11,490
For some people,
just verizon.

3001
02:09:11,520 --> 02:09:16,520
I'll tell you how easy it is so you can 
really shit your pants because I really 

3002
02:09:16,520 --> 02:09:17,280
always dropped some money.
When you get out of prison,

3003
02:09:18,380 --> 02:09:23,380
no matter how old you are,
you going there for heck of a mass 

3004
02:09:23,380 --> 02:09:23,850
followed with a Dui.
You come out when you're 26,

3005
02:09:24,270 --> 02:09:29,270
you could do paperwork and claim 
disability because you're a convicted 

3006
02:09:29,270 --> 02:09:32,031
felon for the rest of your life.
What disability law,

3007
02:09:32,410 --> 02:09:34,190
how is it a disability that you're 
convicted?

3008
02:09:34,200 --> 02:09:39,200
Thought of them will say they can't get 
the job because they're felons who's 

3009
02:09:39,200 --> 02:09:40,260
going to hire a felon,
so you get disability or $600 a month.

3010
02:09:40,320 --> 02:09:43,200
You probably just want to keep you from 
robbing somebody.

3011
02:09:43,530 --> 02:09:45,810
That's probably the logic.
Not going to do it.

3012
02:09:45,810 --> 02:09:48,510
What's he going to do if you're on to 
give you a little something.

3013
02:09:48,540 --> 02:09:51,000
So it was really weird.
I remember leaving there,

3014
02:09:51,001 --> 02:09:55,020
but when my mother died,
she worked under her alias.

3015
02:09:55,410 --> 02:10:00,410
My mother had an alias all those years 
because after she stabbed the guy in 

3016
02:10:00,410 --> 02:10:03,351
Cuba and she came back,
she had to change her name because she 

3017
02:10:03,351 --> 02:10:06,021
came back with her friend's ID.
My Jimmy runs Jesus Christ deal.

3018
02:10:07,260 --> 02:10:12,260
But it was funny that I had a fight for 
social security when my mother died and 

3019
02:10:12,260 --> 02:10:12,450
I was 15.
I needed the money.

3020
02:10:13,080 --> 02:10:16,080
Like I went there 10 times to fight them
and oh,

3021
02:10:16,081 --> 02:10:18,240
we don't know what the fuck.
Don't you know,

3022
02:10:18,630 --> 02:10:21,150
at least give me a $200.
I didn't need the money Joe,

3023
02:10:21,480 --> 02:10:24,170
but it was just so weird that finally 
when they're selling me this,

3024
02:10:24,171 --> 02:10:25,920
I'd go steal for a living.
I go sold drugs.

3025
02:10:25,921 --> 02:10:29,580
I never took after all the drama they 
put me through for social security,

3026
02:10:30,210 --> 02:10:32,400
but they give it to me after I got a 
felony.

3027
02:10:32,700 --> 02:10:33,860
Wow.
Just like that

3028
02:10:34,220 --> 02:10:36,380
for the rest of my life.
$600 a month.

3029
02:10:36,590 --> 02:10:41,590
That would get on the fifth of every 
month and if you claim that they talk 

3030
02:10:41,590 --> 02:10:42,110
about the different disabilities and the
difference,

3031
02:10:42,410 --> 02:10:44,150
you could get up to like $1,200
a month.

3032
02:10:44,180 --> 02:10:49,180
I wonder if people were ever going to 
evolve to the point where a society 

3033
02:10:49,180 --> 02:10:53,530
actually can work if like what our 
problem is is that society and cities 

3034
02:10:53,721 --> 02:10:58,721
and these giant ideas of countries,
they happen so quickly and the 

3035
02:10:58,721 --> 02:11:00,400
development of the human animal that we,
we,

3036
02:11:00,401 --> 02:11:05,401
we,
we haven't really evolved enough with 

3037
02:11:05,401 --> 02:11:05,720
our minds and our behavior to,
to,

3038
02:11:05,750 --> 02:11:10,750
to operate,
like to operate really in a harmonic way

3039
02:11:11,330 --> 02:11:14,210
with a society.
And that's why there's all this crime.

3040
02:11:14,211 --> 02:11:15,560
And that's why there's all this 
bullshit.

3041
02:11:15,710 --> 02:11:20,710
That's why there's all these things that
would not be tolerated in the natural 

3042
02:11:20,710 --> 02:11:23,981
group of 50 people that all know each 
other and love each other and support 

3043
02:11:23,981 --> 02:11:23,981
each other like we are.

3044
02:11:23,981 --> 02:11:26,930
We're designed to operate in tribes.
It's very obvious.

3045
02:11:26,931 --> 02:11:29,780
Everybody wants to be on a team.
Everybody wants to have a family,

3046
02:11:29,781 --> 02:11:31,880
everybody wants to have friends.
Everybody wants to have a group.

3047
02:11:32,010 --> 02:11:35,030
You know where the death squad look.
I mean we are like a little family.

3048
02:11:35,180 --> 02:11:37,430
We call ourselves a death squad.
All of us together,

3049
02:11:37,520 --> 02:11:42,520
you know.
And the reason why we call it with Opi 

3050
02:11:42,520 --> 02:11:43,490
from opiod anthony named is that.
And like 19 fucking whatever the hell it

3051
02:11:43,491 --> 02:11:45,350
was,
2003 or whatever it was.

3052
02:11:45,470 --> 02:11:48,390
I came in with Eddie Bravo and tate and 
you know,

3053
02:11:48,450 --> 02:11:48,940
when he goes,
oh,

3054
02:11:48,941 --> 02:11:51,100
it's Joe Rogan and his death squad.
And then we're like,

3055
02:11:51,140 --> 02:11:52,430
that's hilarious.
Does squad,

3056
02:11:52,490 --> 02:11:54,310
because we were giggling,
we were like a cost offset.

3057
02:11:54,311 --> 02:11:56,630
Desk Squad were the desk right now and 
it sounds so stupid,

3058
02:11:56,930 --> 02:12:01,930
but we call ourselves that and we have 
this desk squad podcast network and all 

3059
02:12:01,930 --> 02:12:02,630
that,
but all this group of comics that we all

3060
02:12:02,900 --> 02:12:03,860
hang out together.

3061
02:12:03,980 --> 02:12:06,290
We are like this,
this little tribe.

3062
02:12:06,440 --> 02:12:08,930
We all liked this little family.
It's like a natural thing,

3063
02:12:09,770 --> 02:12:12,800
but it's not natural to do it with 300 
million people.

3064
02:12:12,860 --> 02:12:15,350
If we were all together and we all lived
together,

3065
02:12:15,500 --> 02:12:17,480
it would be normal.
We all love each other.

3066
02:12:17,481 --> 02:12:19,610
We all take care of each other.
We look out for each other.

3067
02:12:19,611 --> 02:12:21,590
If something's happening to one of us,
we want to help,

3068
02:12:21,780 --> 02:12:23,210
you know that's.
That's normal shit.

3069
02:12:23,870 --> 02:12:28,870
I wonder if if it's ever going to get to
the point where we could operate like 

3070
02:12:28,870 --> 02:12:32,291
that with 300 million people because it 
obviously doesn't work right now when 

3071
02:12:32,291 --> 02:12:33,770
you have crime,
but it's that,

3072
02:12:33,830 --> 02:12:38,830
but I don't want to say never because I 
think that human interaction and what 

3073
02:12:38,830 --> 02:12:43,660
where we are right now is so different 
than where it was in the thirties and 

3074
02:12:43,660 --> 02:12:46,280
the twenties in the fifties and just 
really 10 years ago.

3075
02:12:46,340 --> 02:12:49,820
Social Media and the interaction that we
have with human beings today,

3076
02:12:49,821 --> 02:12:52,730
the interaction that we have on with 
just with twitter alone,

3077
02:12:52,880 --> 02:12:57,880
it's so different than than human beings
who grew up in a different generation 

3078
02:12:57,880 --> 02:13:02,431
that didn't have this and our connection
with each other is very different than 

3079
02:13:02,431 --> 02:13:06,551
people that grew up in a different 
generation and I think that that's part 

3080
02:13:06,551 --> 02:13:10,271
of the evolution of the human being and 
I think that human beings are slowly 

3081
02:13:10,271 --> 02:13:14,861
trying to figure out how to work 
together in these big giant ass fucking 

3082
02:13:14,861 --> 02:13:16,640
groups.
I don't think it's impossible.

3083
02:13:16,940 --> 02:13:21,940
It obviously depends on raising children
correctly and not developing incredibly 

3084
02:13:22,791 --> 02:13:25,670
fucked up human beings that are a 
liability,

3085
02:13:26,060 --> 02:13:31,060
but that's possible too.
You grew up fucked up and you're not a 

3086
02:13:31,060 --> 02:13:31,060
liability.
You know what I mean?

3087
02:13:31,060 --> 02:13:35,820
Thinking about the craziest stories 
you've told just today about wanting to 

3088
02:13:35,820 --> 02:13:36,090
kill people,
smacking people,

3089
02:13:36,240 --> 02:13:41,240
the fact that you're a criminal and a 
thief and that you've been to jail and 

3090
02:13:41,240 --> 02:13:44,181
all these different things,
but yet here you are hanging out at my 

3091
02:13:44,181 --> 02:13:44,181
house.

3092
02:13:44,181 --> 02:13:44,181
She went on to my best friends.
You're very productive.

3093
02:13:44,181 --> 02:13:45,390
You're a fucking beautiful standup 
comedian,

3094
02:13:45,570 --> 02:13:47,790
you're a great guy,
you've got a great podcast,

3095
02:13:47,950 --> 02:13:52,950
you know what I'm saying?
Like you pulled it together to become 

3096
02:13:52,950 --> 02:13:53,130
something different.
And Brian,

3097
02:13:53,160 --> 02:13:54,810
you know,
coming from fucking Columbus,

3098
02:13:54,811 --> 02:13:59,811
Ohio and working in a fucking gateway 
and being stuck in this town and you 

3099
02:13:59,811 --> 02:14:04,551
know,
and being surrounded by a bunch of 

3100
02:14:04,551 --> 02:14:04,551
knuckleheads,
you've pulled it together,

3101
02:14:04,551 --> 02:14:05,970
you've become someone different.
We all evolve.

3102
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:11,000
We all move into some new phase of life 
and interact with everybody that's 

3103
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:15,570
around us in a very different way.
Is that possible on a mass level?

3104
02:14:15,750 --> 02:14:20,750
Is that possible as a society that we 
all hold each other accountable,

3105
02:14:21,210 --> 02:14:26,210
all of us individually.
And you become 300 million people 

3106
02:14:26,210 --> 02:14:26,210
together.
No,

3107
02:14:26,210 --> 02:14:26,210
no,
no,

3108
02:14:26,210 --> 02:14:30,550
no.
We come from a society where people 

3109
02:14:30,550 --> 02:14:30,550
don't give a fuck with two fucking 
selfish.

3110
02:14:30,550 --> 02:14:33,200
Some computers and shit.
I've separated us even more.

3111
02:14:33,260 --> 02:14:37,010
I think they can separate us even more.
I like human contact.

3112
02:14:37,011 --> 02:14:38,480
I do too,
but I like this.

3113
02:14:38,820 --> 02:14:41,960
My computer guy was really good too.
And I said to Eddie,

3114
02:14:41,961 --> 02:14:46,961
Eddie,
can you call and you take a picture and 

3115
02:14:46,961 --> 02:14:46,961
this is something that we.
You said to me when that,

3116
02:14:46,961 --> 02:14:48,590
can you take a picture and put it on 
twitter?

3117
02:14:48,591 --> 02:14:49,100
And he goes,
yeah,

3118
02:14:49,101 --> 02:14:50,420
my wife goes,
you could do it too.

3119
02:14:50,720 --> 02:14:51,510
And I said,
you don't want.

3120
02:14:51,520 --> 02:14:52,790
But I'm out.
I'm living my life.

3121
02:14:52,820 --> 02:14:54,500
I don't want to be beat a fucking 
computer when I'm out.

3122
02:14:54,650 --> 02:14:57,200
That means you're not fucking livid when
I'm out of my house.

3123
02:14:57,201 --> 02:14:59,360
I don't want to say twitter.
I don't want to see facebook.

3124
02:14:59,450 --> 02:15:00,230
I don't want to seem nothing.

3125
02:15:00,230 --> 02:15:02,420
I'm living my fucking life.
That's what the problem is,

3126
02:15:02,421 --> 02:15:07,421
that people are not living no more.
They were on these fucking things too 

3127
02:15:07,421 --> 02:15:07,421
much and it's losing a little bit of 
human touch.

3128
02:15:07,610 --> 02:15:12,610
That's what we all do.
That's what I feel I feel between the 

3129
02:15:12,610 --> 02:15:12,610
texting and a lot of stuff.
It cuts time,

3130
02:15:12,610 --> 02:15:14,630
but we'll losing human contact.
It's making us lazy.

3131
02:15:14,631 --> 02:15:19,631
A couple of years ago,
commercial came out and it was about a 

3132
02:15:19,631 --> 02:15:19,631
business and the guy goes,
I'm having a meeting.

3133
02:15:19,640 --> 02:15:22,540
And he started giving away plane tickets
and the people will like,

3134
02:15:22,541 --> 02:15:23,640
the salesmen were like,
Whoa,

3135
02:15:23,930 --> 02:15:24,950
what's this?
And he goes,

3136
02:15:24,951 --> 02:15:27,210
we've lost our fucking human 
[inaudible].

3137
02:15:27,380 --> 02:15:30,350
Everything is a twit or a fucking email 
or something.

3138
02:15:30,500 --> 02:15:32,980
We're going to go back to belly to belly
sales to,

3139
02:15:32,981 --> 02:15:34,730
to,
to look at people in the fucking eye and

3140
02:15:34,760 --> 02:15:36,160
talk to people again.
And,

3141
02:15:36,280 --> 02:15:37,360
and that's,
I mean,

3142
02:15:37,490 --> 02:15:40,160
we're so lose now,
this fucking crime.

3143
02:15:40,160 --> 02:15:42,050
They're jumping up and down and fucking 
England.

3144
02:15:42,350 --> 02:15:46,100
Mexico's as volatile as it's ever been.
We're in no danger.

3145
02:15:46,280 --> 02:15:51,280
We can't even drive in fucking Hollywood
because people won't even put that 

3146
02:15:51,280 --> 02:15:51,280
fucking blinkers on.
They're so selfish.

3147
02:15:51,280 --> 02:15:56,050
That's the first way of changing Joe.
The way I changed was to start from 

3148
02:15:56,050 --> 02:15:57,020
scratch.
If you can't pick up a piece of paper as

3149
02:15:57,021 --> 02:15:59,480
you're walking,
you're not going to change if you can't.

3150
02:15:59,600 --> 02:16:00,320
You know,
I used to,

3151
02:16:00,380 --> 02:16:03,290
when I got the longest shot and I used 
to go to all these meetings in Hollywood

3152
02:16:03,530 --> 02:16:08,530
and you go to all these meetings and 
every fucking meeting you go to some 

3153
02:16:08,530 --> 02:16:10,160
dumb motherfucker shows up 20 minutes 
late and says to you,

3154
02:16:10,250 --> 02:16:11,450
well,
what's the traffic one?

3155
02:16:11,510 --> 02:16:12,650
Motherfucker,
you live in La,

3156
02:16:12,990 --> 02:16:14,690
you and guess what?
I started doing joe.

3157
02:16:14,990 --> 02:16:18,110
I started being laid and then one day I 
caught myself and I go,

3158
02:16:18,111 --> 02:16:20,690
you don't want.
This is what I'm talking about.

3159
02:16:20,960 --> 02:16:24,110
For me to be a better productive,
I have to show people,

3160
02:16:24,350 --> 02:16:26,240
not tell them,
show people,

3161
02:16:26,510 --> 02:16:28,580
and now when I get to a meeting and 
you're 20 minutes late,

3162
02:16:28,610 --> 02:16:28,910
I say

3163
02:16:30,030 --> 02:16:32,260
I say something to you because we're 
men.

3164
02:16:32,380 --> 02:16:36,360
That's how character you never like an 
angry is he today and never very angry,

3165
02:16:36,610 --> 02:16:41,610
very angry,
never let your character ruin your 

3166
02:16:41,610 --> 02:16:41,710
destiny.
And it all starts with little things.

3167
02:16:41,830 --> 02:16:45,550
It doesn't start with being a fake and 
it starts with little things.

3168
02:16:45,790 --> 02:16:48,160
It's character is what people don't see 
you doing.

3169
02:16:48,610 --> 02:16:50,470
It's the things that pit and that's what
we've forgotten.

3170
02:16:50,740 --> 02:16:52,750
Driving Hollywood the other day.
Data was eight,

3171
02:16:52,751 --> 02:16:53,980
conquer lap.
Okay,

3172
02:16:53,981 --> 02:16:58,981
I agree.
I think that there's definitely people 

3173
02:16:58,981 --> 02:17:02,280
need character joey,
but you're discounting the idea that 

3174
02:17:02,280 --> 02:17:03,310
technology is connecting people and 
that's ridiculous.

3175
02:17:03,880 --> 02:17:07,750
You're discounting the idea that twitter
connects people in the facebook connects

3176
02:17:07,751 --> 02:17:08,530
people.
Yes,

3177
02:17:08,531 --> 02:17:11,050
you should have human interaction and 
you know what?

3178
02:17:11,100 --> 02:17:14,980
You should have human interaction 
showing up dog to people making.

3179
02:17:15,010 --> 02:17:17,470
So you got a couple of idiots parking.
No,

3180
02:17:17,530 --> 02:17:20,440
that doesn't mean that there's not a 
trend of interconnection.

3181
02:17:20,470 --> 02:17:21,460
Douchebag,
mothers,

3182
02:17:21,461 --> 02:17:22,900
some of them,
some of them.

3183
02:17:22,930 --> 02:17:24,880
Not.
Everybody starts and we want to make the

3184
02:17:24,881 --> 02:17:26,500
world a lot better.
Starts with the little things.

3185
02:17:26,680 --> 02:17:31,300
We could talk all this nonsense to 
people because before it all starts with

3186
02:17:31,310 --> 02:17:32,290
you dog.
Oh my God.

3187
02:17:32,291 --> 02:17:33,820
Because the word,
all these people are,

3188
02:17:33,821 --> 02:17:36,220
you know,
so kind of a world and all this shit.

3189
02:17:36,240 --> 02:17:38,410
In the last.
I've never seen him angry.

3190
02:17:39,340 --> 02:17:40,560
I believe in doing.
I'm.

3191
02:17:40,750 --> 02:17:41,520
I know.
But Joey,

3192
02:17:41,550 --> 02:17:45,160
we're talking about a positive thing and
all of a sudden you turned anything.

3193
02:17:45,161 --> 02:17:47,480
We talk about into something where 
you're yelling at someone.

3194
02:17:47,510 --> 02:17:47,740
No,
no,

3195
02:17:47,741 --> 02:17:48,610
no.
I'm not yelling at me,

3196
02:17:48,630 --> 02:17:51,130
isn't it Brian?
I'm passionate about something.

3197
02:17:51,430 --> 02:17:52,930
I'm not.
Y'All understand what I'm saying?

3198
02:17:52,950 --> 02:17:55,060
Everything is some fucking molds.
Just fucking idiot.

3199
02:17:55,330 --> 02:17:56,770
Compassion.
I'd done it.

3200
02:17:56,771 --> 02:18:01,771
I understand the fuck to tell you.
You want me to be honest with you on 

3201
02:18:01,771 --> 02:18:01,771
your podcasts,
right?

3202
02:18:01,771 --> 02:18:01,771
If not,
you quote one of your buddies.

3203
02:18:01,771 --> 02:18:02,770
Joey.
I want you to be honest,

3204
02:18:02,771 --> 02:18:07,771
but I think we should be able to discuss
ideas with you screaming about some 

3205
02:18:08,480 --> 02:18:13,480
personal.
I understand why you got to get me real 

3206
02:18:13,480 --> 02:18:13,690
stone when I get here though.
That's what happened.

3207
02:18:13,691 --> 02:18:15,790
Did you say you peed on yourself?
I peed on myself.

3208
02:18:16,030 --> 02:18:17,830
How did you do that?
Fucking sleeping.

3209
02:18:17,860 --> 02:18:19,810
Woke up.
I was so cold in your bed.

3210
02:18:20,030 --> 02:18:25,030
The in my bed.
I beat up because I had the sleep apnea 

3211
02:18:25,030 --> 02:18:28,111
mask on.
So beat up word fuck in the pants with 

3212
02:18:28,111 --> 02:18:28,510
purpose.
Oh yeah,

3213
02:18:28,511 --> 02:18:29,370
yeah,
I'd do that every day.

3214
02:18:30,420 --> 02:18:32,810
I was asleep.
I was,

3215
02:18:32,900 --> 02:18:34,930
you know,
sometimes my room,

3216
02:18:35,620 --> 02:18:37,770
my room was fucking 50 below zero it 
now.

3217
02:18:38,190 --> 02:18:40,570
So some nights at six.
I'm like to the what is your wife?

3218
02:18:40,571 --> 02:18:45,430
Did she bundle up bumble up big time?
She was so she bundles up saying you get

3219
02:18:45,431 --> 02:18:47,480
that AC cranked on winter.

3220
02:18:47,830 --> 02:18:49,720
How many cats are sleeping with you when
you're doing this?

3221
02:18:50,320 --> 02:18:52,930
To only to your same two every time.
Yeah,

3222
02:18:53,380 --> 02:18:58,380
and the other.
The other nine don't get embarrassed 

3223
02:18:58,380 --> 02:19:00,940
about with the cold and cold there.
They find they can't take the cold 

3224
02:19:00,940 --> 02:19:04,370
there.
Sometimes I get up and move on that my 

3225
02:19:04,370 --> 02:19:04,370
wife has gone.
How do you keep your,

3226
02:19:04,370 --> 02:19:06,670
your place from smelling my cat shit 
because I have a problem with my fucking

3227
02:19:06,671 --> 02:19:07,470
office.
Clean.

3228
02:19:07,510 --> 02:19:09,090
You clean it every day,
right?

3229
02:19:09,680 --> 02:19:11,110
Everyday.
If you're a filthy animal,

3230
02:19:11,111 --> 02:19:13,610
that's what happened to change every 
day.

3231
02:19:13,611 --> 02:19:15,180
It's still stinks.
No like shit.

3232
02:19:15,220 --> 02:19:16,870
Every time I.
my little girl,

3233
02:19:16,871 --> 02:19:20,140
she loves wet food will spazz.
She loves wet food,

3234
02:19:20,141 --> 02:19:24,490
but when I give her that wet food,
God damaged the wet food will kill you,

3235
02:19:24,520 --> 02:19:26,350
but they love it.
They love it.

3236
02:19:26,440 --> 02:19:28,040
I only give her wet food every couple of
days.

3237
02:19:28,070 --> 02:19:31,310
Get these achievement house.
I pay a little extra for these crystals.

3238
02:19:31,880 --> 02:19:32,150
Yeah,

3239
02:19:32,250 --> 02:19:34,120
right now.
Do you like the Blue Crystal?

3240
02:19:34,121 --> 02:19:37,970
Are you talking about the blue light 
will watch them.

3241
02:19:38,410 --> 02:19:41,540
Shit.
Just like we do a podcast once a while,

3242
02:19:41,541 --> 02:19:44,200
all about a cat called podcasts and 
that's all we were like.

3243
02:19:44,201 --> 02:19:46,350
We talked about litter control and 
thing.

3244
02:19:46,900 --> 02:19:51,900
You don't get one of those electric ones
that like a month and they didn't

3245
02:19:55,740 --> 02:20:00,740
do.
You have a litter box with a dome over 

3246
02:20:00,740 --> 02:20:00,740
it.
You have got to have that.

3247
02:20:00,740 --> 02:20:01,710
I got four dorms.
I got one day.

3248
02:20:01,760 --> 02:20:02,450
They say,
oh,

3249
02:20:02,451 --> 02:20:04,550
it's a carbon filter.
My little girl,

3250
02:20:04,551 --> 02:20:07,940
that little spasm,
she will make the stinky shit.

3251
02:20:08,260 --> 02:20:09,590
I almost get upset at her,
you know,

3252
02:20:09,591 --> 02:20:11,050
but no,
you can't get up such.

3253
02:20:11,660 --> 02:20:13,610
As soon as I smell something,
I'll clean it out.

3254
02:20:13,640 --> 02:20:16,690
I got to scoop it out and flushing,
but it stinks to do.

3255
02:20:16,691 --> 02:20:20,000
I scoop it out and flushing and I 
changed every two days,

3256
02:20:20,001 --> 02:20:25,001
but I stay on it.
It's just so gross as creepy little 

3257
02:20:25,001 --> 02:20:27,701
animals.
They're in there scratching on the 

3258
02:20:27,701 --> 02:20:30,640
Shitty fucking glitter and pissy litter 
and then they get out and just walk 

3259
02:20:30,640 --> 02:20:32,260
around your house.
Shitty litter and pissy little pause and

3260
02:20:32,280 --> 02:20:32,750
it's,
you know,

3261
02:20:33,650 --> 02:20:36,810
definitely.
He definitely has feline virus for sure.

3262
02:20:37,060 --> 02:20:40,580
Sure.
Honestly,

3263
02:20:40,581 --> 02:20:42,110
I think this will be great for the 
podcast,

3264
02:20:42,140 --> 02:20:44,510
get it tested and we give it like live 
results.

3265
02:20:45,390 --> 02:20:45,970
Those don't know

3266
02:20:46,250 --> 02:20:51,250
we're talking about.
There's a cat parasite called toxo 

3267
02:20:51,250 --> 02:20:51,250
plasma.
Look it up on the Internet.

3268
02:20:51,250 --> 02:20:56,080
A lot of people infected by this cad 
parasite and it alters human behavior 

3269
02:20:56,080 --> 02:20:57,760
and it makes you more impulsive and 
crazy and that's probably true.

3270
02:20:57,860 --> 02:21:00,010
Make girls more submissive.
Guys.

3271
02:21:00,020 --> 02:21:03,980
Keep believing that dumb shit.
You keep believing what toxoplasma.

3272
02:21:04,040 --> 02:21:06,200
It's 100 percent true.
No,

3273
02:21:06,220 --> 02:21:08,330
it's not.
It's 60 million Americans.

3274
02:21:08,520 --> 02:21:10,250
I've had cats.
Was six fucking Joey.

3275
02:21:10,370 --> 02:21:12,560
It also makes your wife or your 
girlfriend whatever.

3276
02:21:12,561 --> 02:21:13,390
You were saying that.
No,

3277
02:21:13,410 --> 02:21:13,710
no,
no,

3278
02:21:13,711 --> 02:21:18,711
no,
no fact that says days are over when you

3279
02:21:19,300 --> 02:21:20,030
come.
Correct.

3280
02:21:20,031 --> 02:21:21,740
Because if not,
I walk out of the fucking room.

3281
02:21:21,800 --> 02:21:26,750
Shelly toxo plasma is nonsense.
Now I got a cat disease.

3282
02:21:26,751 --> 02:21:27,580
What I might cat,
man,

3283
02:21:27,680 --> 02:21:30,100
listen to you talk.
That sounds exactly like they say what?

3284
02:21:30,101 --> 02:21:35,101
Someone who can aggravate someone who 
has a cat disease talks exactly like 

3285
02:21:35,101 --> 02:21:35,480
that.
I know,

3286
02:21:35,560 --> 02:21:36,680
I know.
That's what it is.

3287
02:21:36,770 --> 02:21:38,540
Look Joey,
a lot of people have it.

3288
02:21:38,541 --> 02:21:40,490
They don't know that they have it.
I'm sure I have it.

3289
02:21:40,550 --> 02:21:41,690
Sixty dollars million

3290
02:21:41,730 --> 02:21:43,700
Americans have it.
Sixty dollars million.

3291
02:21:43,980 --> 02:21:44,270
No,
no.

3292
02:21:44,510 --> 02:21:44,950
What do you mean here?

3293
02:21:45,150 --> 02:21:48,460
They all.
They all got iphone.

3294
02:21:48,470 --> 02:21:50,590
So what time you got time for you to go 
home?

3295
02:21:51,930 --> 02:21:52,550
What is it?
10,

3296
02:21:52,551 --> 02:21:53,920
15,
55.

3297
02:21:53,940 --> 02:21:58,940
Zero.
You should do this with your wife 

3298
02:21:58,940 --> 02:22:00,551
earlier.
It's awesome to have her put her mouth 

3299
02:22:00,551 --> 02:22:02,240
inside of your mouth and talk inside 
your mouth.

3300
02:22:02,241 --> 02:22:03,090
It's cool.
Okay.

3301
02:22:03,230 --> 02:22:04,760
Jesus fucking Christ.
Breads.

3302
02:22:04,910 --> 02:22:07,830
You wonder why people yell at you.
You wonder why people yell at you.

3303
02:22:07,920 --> 02:22:09,020
Knock it.
You'll like it.

3304
02:22:09,050 --> 02:22:09,430
No.
What?

3305
02:22:09,440 --> 02:22:11,240
No one talks inside my mouth.
Dude.

3306
02:22:11,560 --> 02:22:14,270
Echoes in the head.
It's so creepy sounding.

3307
02:22:14,950 --> 02:22:16,600
This what I'm saying?
Just try it out.

3308
02:22:16,610 --> 02:22:19,280
Make sure there's no errors.
Fight in this podcast.

3309
02:22:19,281 --> 02:22:24,281
We have really covered the full spectrum
of welfare and black people in the movie

3310
02:22:25,980 --> 02:22:29,500
theaters and stabbing people walking in 
air conditioning.

3311
02:22:30,150 --> 02:22:32,490
There is air conditioning here.
Believe it or not.

3312
02:22:33,510 --> 02:22:36,300
And we've covered everything.
We've covered it all folks.

3313
02:22:36,301 --> 02:22:38,160
And you know,
it's been a wild ride.

3314
02:22:38,220 --> 02:22:39,570
And uh,
I enjoyed it.

3315
02:22:39,600 --> 02:22:43,020
So most of the time,
most of the time it was a few times.

3316
02:22:43,890 --> 02:22:47,540
I love it when Joey Diaz goes crazy.
It's one of my favorite things ever.

3317
02:22:47,640 --> 02:22:48,840
Yeah.
I love when you go off to,

3318
02:22:48,841 --> 02:22:52,440
but you know there's no absolutes on 
these.

3319
02:22:52,470 --> 02:22:53,490
I love you to death,
Bro.

3320
02:22:53,491 --> 02:22:58,491
You invite me up here,
but have you got to get me in here and 

3321
02:22:58,491 --> 02:22:59,080
good shit from the jump.
You know how I roll?

3322
02:22:59,250 --> 02:23:04,250
I can't have that shit that you had this
guy got to get the a one weed and calm 

3323
02:23:04,250 --> 02:23:08,160
me down.
I think you need to go to the gym 

3324
02:23:08,160 --> 02:23:08,390
between Rick and Hollywood is different 
from crazy.

3325
02:23:08,600 --> 02:23:12,240
You're so crazy.
I got to shit on labrea much.

3326
02:23:12,480 --> 02:23:14,070
I got this shit at the clinic where the 
guy.

3327
02:23:14,560 --> 02:23:16,760
This shit show now.
This is from the brand.

3328
02:23:18,140 --> 02:23:20,940
Believe he did it.
I can't believe you that.

3329
02:23:21,070 --> 02:23:22,050
It's just.
Yeah,

3330
02:23:22,370 --> 02:23:23,350
I know.
I gave him some bunk.

3331
02:23:23,351 --> 02:23:24,840
We'd right.
What is it a fumble?

3332
02:23:24,841 --> 02:23:25,170
Lumps.

3333
02:23:30,450 --> 02:23:31,970
It's Hannah Montana.
No,

3334
02:23:32,220 --> 02:23:34,080
fucking.
When Abbott and Costello,

3335
02:23:34,081 --> 02:23:39,081
he used to pull scans.
They used to always work for the 

3336
02:23:39,081 --> 02:23:39,081
subsequent of that company because it 
was make believe.

3337
02:23:39,081 --> 02:23:40,700
How do you remember that?
That's comedy.

3338
02:23:40,710 --> 02:23:44,050
That's real comedy.
Shit.

3339
02:23:44,100 --> 02:23:46,680
Ladies and gentlemen,
I hope you learned a lot today.

3340
02:23:46,740 --> 02:23:49,960
Stay black because we sure did.
The fuck is.

3341
02:23:50,630 --> 02:23:51,710
This is.
Look,

3342
02:23:51,900 --> 02:23:54,480
there's a full spectrum of Joey Diaz 
today.

3343
02:23:54,481 --> 02:23:57,060
We got an angry intense Joe Diaz 
birthday Rogan.

3344
02:23:57,090 --> 02:23:57,950
Happy Birthday.
Thank you.

3345
02:23:57,951 --> 02:23:59,370
It's not quite my birthday.
Happy Birthday.

3346
02:23:59,371 --> 02:24:01,980
You Brian [inaudible] birthday already 
passed and we haven't brought up.

3347
02:24:02,400 --> 02:24:06,420
Go see planet of the apes.
Go See red states.

3348
02:24:06,470 --> 02:24:08,030
If I'm see us at the PAP,

02:24:12,841 --> 02:24:16,110
Come see us at the paramount theater in 
Denver.

3351
02:24:16,370 --> 02:24:19,650
September 23rd and last year.
Joey Diaz,

3352
02:24:19,651 --> 02:24:23,460
his ex wife or her ex husband.
Is He still married to that guy?

3353
02:24:24,420 --> 02:24:27,000
Don't come if you're that guy.
Don't come.

3354
02:24:27,030 --> 02:24:27,750
Oh,

The 25th of August.
Who's with you tomorrow night and brand?

3358
02:24:35,010 --> 02:24:37,350
I have no fucking idea.
You don't know.

3359
02:24:37,710 --> 02:24:39,900
Maybe I'll come down.
I'm working in Pomona tomorrow night.

3360
02:24:39,930 --> 02:24:42,570
Is that close to brand?
If it is,

3361
02:24:42,571 --> 02:24:44,400
I'll come down.
Listen folks,

3362
02:24:44,490 --> 02:24:46,260
I fucking love you.
I love you.

3363
02:24:46,380 --> 02:24:50,640
I hope you enjoyed this.
This is not a normal one.

3364
02:24:50,720 --> 02:24:52,930
It's a little different,
but it is what it is.

3365
02:24:54,750 --> 02:24:56,520
It's all love.
It's all love.

3366
02:24:56,521 --> 02:25:01,521
We love you.
This is the only podcast we're doing 

3367
02:25:01,521 --> 02:25:03,201
this week.
Very busy this week with the fear 

3368
02:25:03,201 --> 02:25:03,201
factor,
but you know,

3369
02:25:03,201 --> 02:25:04,170
that's why I love you guys is why we 
decided to do a late night one.

3370
02:25:04,171 --> 02:25:06,780
I worked all day and uh,
and that's it.

3371
02:25:06,781 --> 02:25:11,781
So this is me,
me on Joey or probably do on this 

3372
02:25:11,781 --> 02:25:11,781
weekend.
We'll probably do it on the plane on the

3373
02:25:11,781 --> 02:25:14,280
way back home and that's it.
See you next week.

3374
02:25:14,340 --> 02:25:19,340
Next week with Kevin Smith.
I'm trying to get Duncan in here next 

3375
02:25:19,340 --> 02:25:19,340
week too.
And um,

3376
02:25:19,340 --> 02:25:20,730
we're supposed to do Jane Moore,
but Brian and him had a twitter feud.

3377
02:25:20,731 --> 02:25:22,950
So I don't know if that's going to take 
place or not.

3378
02:25:23,590 --> 02:25:23,980
We'll

3379
02:25:23,980 --> 02:25:26,020
see.
Either way.

3380
02:25:26,350 --> 02:25:29,410
Shizam Salaam Alaikum.
Big Kiss,

3381
02:25:29,420 --> 02:25:31,690
Tmr Mama.
Anything to say?

3382
02:25:31,691 --> 02:25:33,970
Brian?
I love the fleshlight Joey Diaz.

3383
02:25:34,300 --> 02:25:35,970
Jordan.
I liked j dot ward.

3384
02:25:36,190 --> 02:25:41,190
You don't lecture anymore anymore.
He's think he got a little crazy when a 

3385
02:25:41,190 --> 02:25:42,070
little baby.
Did he get a little,

3386
02:25:42,071 --> 02:25:47,071
you know,
there was a little twitter war out of 

3387
02:25:47,071 --> 02:25:47,071
nowhere.
You want to explain that.

3388
02:25:47,071 --> 02:25:47,110
He said,
all right,

3389
02:25:47,340 --> 02:25:49,780
here's the whole j dot region in 
nutshell.

3390
02:25:50,110 --> 02:25:51,480
He's friends with Tom Segura,
right?

3391
02:25:51,580 --> 02:25:52,360
And Tom's like,
hey,

3392
02:25:52,361 --> 02:25:55,380
can you please help Jay Mohr out,
give them some information.

3393
02:25:55,390 --> 02:25:57,520
He wants to do a podcast if he could 
just talk to him.

3394
02:25:57,910 --> 02:25:58,750
So I was like,
yeah,

3395
02:25:58,751 --> 02:25:59,950
sure.
I'm to give me a call.

3396
02:26:00,160 --> 02:26:00,910
He calls me up.
I'm like,

3397
02:26:00,911 --> 02:26:01,300
Hey,
you know,

3398
02:26:01,340 --> 02:26:06,340
I'm really busy but I can lead you in 
the right direction if I ever have any 

3399
02:26:06,340 --> 02:26:09,601
free chance.
I'll help you out here and there and 

3400
02:26:09,601 --> 02:26:09,601
stuff like that.

3401
02:26:09,601 --> 02:26:09,601
He goes,
well,

3402
02:26:09,601 --> 02:26:09,601
can you just email me all the things I 
need?

3403
02:26:09,601 --> 02:26:13,981
So I emailed them like some some 
equipment that he should buy on 

3404
02:26:13,981 --> 02:26:16,921
Amazon.com.
Amazon Dot Com gave him a web host that 

3405
02:26:16,921 --> 02:26:17,410
he should go.
And then he wrote me back like,

3406
02:26:17,470 --> 02:26:18,220
hey,
how much this is,

3407
02:26:18,221 --> 02:26:19,870
all this stuff costs.
And I'm like,

3408
02:26:19,900 --> 02:26:21,360
well,
just click on the links,

3409
02:26:21,400 --> 02:26:22,120
you know.
Anyways.

3410
02:26:22,210 --> 02:26:24,100
So I wrote back and said he asked you to
add it all up.

3411
02:26:24,130 --> 02:26:24,420
Yeah.
Yeah.

3412
02:26:24,460 --> 02:26:25,080
He and he,
uh,

3413
02:26:25,150 --> 02:26:26,290
how did he say?
He's like,

3414
02:26:26,291 --> 02:26:28,150
Hey,
can you add that all up for me?

3415
02:26:28,151 --> 02:26:29,710
Or something like that.
Can you add that all?

3416
02:26:29,711 --> 02:26:34,711
Yeah,
like he wanted me to click on all the 

3417
02:26:34,711 --> 02:26:34,711
links and added up for him for some 
reason.

3418
02:26:34,711 --> 02:26:34,980
Wow.
That's asking a lot.

3419
02:26:35,060 --> 02:26:40,060
Well,
it's asking a lot from a guy you don't 

3420
02:26:40,060 --> 02:26:40,060
know,
don't know.

3421
02:26:40,060 --> 02:26:42,391
The guy's sudden you,
you went out of your way to provide him 

3422
02:26:42,391 --> 02:26:42,391
with all the information.

3423
02:26:42,391 --> 02:26:43,510
And it was like,
I don't know,

3424
02:26:43,511 --> 02:26:44,740
this guy,
I'm doing this favor.

3425
02:26:44,770 --> 02:26:49,770
I had to go on Amazon,
find links and copy and paste and 

3426
02:26:49,770 --> 02:26:51,130
actually spend some time like for a 
complete stranger,

3427
02:26:51,131 --> 02:26:51,760
you know?
Right.

3428
02:26:51,970 --> 02:26:53,810
And so then he said,
you've never met Jane Moore,

3429
02:26:53,860 --> 02:26:56,050
never met j dot Moore.
I sold them and he says,

3430
02:26:56,110 --> 02:26:57,550
can you add all this shit up?
Yeah.

3431
02:26:57,760 --> 02:26:58,870
And so,
and I said,

3432
02:26:58,871 --> 02:26:59,410
you know,
look,

3433
02:26:59,440 --> 02:27:00,260
I,
I,

3434
02:27:00,380 --> 02:27:02,440
because I think he was kind of confused 
with everything.

3435
02:27:02,441 --> 02:27:02,820
He's like,
you.

3436
02:27:03,160 --> 02:27:03,730
I said,
hey,

3437
02:27:03,731 --> 02:27:06,820
if you want to use my studio,
you can use it anytime you want to,

3438
02:27:06,970 --> 02:27:11,970
you know,
and he completely ignored that and he 

3439
02:27:11,970 --> 02:27:11,970
goes,
hey,

3440
02:27:11,970 --> 02:27:11,970
you know,
stepping yet another email.

3441
02:27:11,970 --> 02:27:14,770
We're on the road at the time I missed 
his last email he sent me.

3442
02:27:14,771 --> 02:27:19,771
I didn't even know he sent it to me.
Come to like a month or two later 

3443
02:27:19,771 --> 02:27:19,771
Thompson.

3444
02:27:19,771 --> 02:27:22,020
He goes,
can you please write jay more a real,

3445
02:27:22,040 --> 02:27:26,050
like a letter detailing everything he 
needs to do to do a podcast.

3446
02:27:26,080 --> 02:27:26,860
I'm like,
okay,

3447
02:27:26,861 --> 02:27:29,740
I'll make it super detailed.
No,

3448
02:27:29,830 --> 02:27:33,100
that's fine.
Get on itunes on Itunes,

3449
02:27:33,101 --> 02:27:34,690
do this.
Take the SD card.

3450
02:27:34,750 --> 02:27:37,450
Actually was saying take the SD card out
of your computer,

3451
02:27:37,480 --> 02:27:39,160
you know,
like it was that detailed.

3452
02:27:39,310 --> 02:27:43,320
I was writing it and then like two days 
later I'm still writing this letter a,

3453
02:27:43,460 --> 02:27:45,630
I see that he has a podcast.
So I just like,

3454
02:27:45,670 --> 02:27:47,740
Oh I guess with Kevin Smith.
So I'm like,

3455
02:27:47,741 --> 02:27:49,780
you know what,
I don't have to send this out anymore.

3456
02:27:50,230 --> 02:27:55,230
So I just ignored it.
And then I noticed he started tweeting 

3457
02:27:55,230 --> 02:27:58,291
me like fucking crazy,
like tagging me if you search his 

3458
02:27:58,291 --> 02:28:01,390
timeline since March,
he's tweeted my names and their 24 times

3459
02:28:01,480 --> 02:28:03,610
I've never tweeted that jude wants all 
right.

3460
02:28:03,610 --> 02:28:04,900
I don't know this guy.
Right.

3461
02:28:05,110 --> 02:28:07,870
So then finally I'm on my birthday 
weekend and I'm out of town.

3462
02:28:07,871 --> 02:28:10,660
I'm at Disneyland and I'm like looking 
at my phone and it's like,

3463
02:28:10,780 --> 02:28:12,490
fuck you red ban,
you know,

3464
02:28:12,610 --> 02:28:17,610
once you return a phone call.
And he's like saying I don't return 

3465
02:28:17,610 --> 02:28:17,650
phone calls,
check my phone records.

3466
02:28:17,651 --> 02:28:19,930
He's not called.
I've talked to him once on the phone.

3467
02:28:20,020 --> 02:28:23,000
He's never called me again.
So he's like making up all this shit and

3468
02:28:23,001 --> 02:28:26,090
telling me to fuck off and about.
I have no idea.

3469
02:28:26,091 --> 02:28:26,750
But you know,
from,

3470
02:28:27,020 --> 02:28:32,020
from,
from the people that came to me after 

3471
02:28:32,020 --> 02:28:32,020
that,
like a lot of,

3472
02:28:32,020 --> 02:28:32,930
a big comedians came to me and was like,
dude,

3473
02:28:33,100 --> 02:28:33,640
you know,
we,

3474
02:28:33,710 --> 02:28:35,060
I have problems with him,
you know,

3475
02:28:35,061 --> 02:28:36,330
f this guy.
Don't,

3476
02:28:36,380 --> 02:28:37,730
don't worry.
Doesn't like them.

3477
02:28:37,760 --> 02:28:39,640
Yeah.
Stan hope doesn't like him.

3478
02:28:39,770 --> 02:28:41,120
That's pretty well known.

3479
02:28:41,120 --> 02:28:42,110
But uh,
yeah,

3480
02:28:42,111 --> 02:28:43,190
I mean it's,
you know what?

3481
02:28:43,191 --> 02:28:45,830
I don't know what his problem is.
I have no problem with the guy.

3482
02:28:45,860 --> 02:28:46,340
I just,
you know,

3483
02:28:46,341 --> 02:28:50,440
he had a little hissy fit and now just 
so I wouldn't it though,

3484
02:28:50,450 --> 02:28:52,920
it doesn't make sense that he would just
go after you on twitter like that and he

3485
02:28:52,921 --> 02:28:57,921
was like,
be a man while he's going after you on 

3486
02:28:57,921 --> 02:28:59,840
twitter and he's saying that I'm not 
returning calls.

3487
02:28:59,841 --> 02:29:02,830
I'm making a pretty much fake bullshit.
How weird is it to,

3488
02:29:02,850 --> 02:29:05,990
to go after someone on twitter saying 
you're not calling me?

3489
02:29:06,170 --> 02:29:06,800
Yeah,
like,

3490
02:29:06,801 --> 02:29:09,830
that's,
that's weird to will be a man.

3491
02:29:09,831 --> 02:29:12,650
Are you going after someone on twitter?
And I liked Jay.

3492
02:29:12,651 --> 02:29:14,240
I've never had a single problem with 
Jay.

3493
02:29:14,510 --> 02:29:19,510
Jay Moore and I have always been cool.
I was looking forward to having him on 

3494
02:29:19,510 --> 02:29:20,030
the podcast and I actually wrote him a 
message saying,

3495
02:29:20,031 --> 02:29:21,770
Hey,
let's work this out next week.

3496
02:29:21,770 --> 02:29:23,480
I'm busy with fear factor.
I'll call you soon.

3497
02:29:23,600 --> 02:29:28,600
And then right after I wrote that,
then I read all these tweets that you 

3498
02:29:28,600 --> 02:29:31,430
and him were going back and forth with 
wasn't doing shit.

3499
02:29:31,470 --> 02:29:34,280
He,
towards you were just getting tweeted at

3500
02:29:34,281 --> 02:29:39,281
when he was calling you a bitch or 
whatever the fuck he was saying to you 

3501
02:29:39,281 --> 02:29:39,281
and I was like,
this is just weird.

3502
02:29:39,281 --> 02:29:43,690
Did he get drunk or something and just 
know from what people have been telling 

3503
02:29:43,690 --> 02:29:43,690
me that he has a,
a,

3504
02:29:43,690 --> 02:29:46,430
a side of him where he spazzes out and 
uh,

3505
02:29:46,610 --> 02:29:51,610
this is normal for him.
Like I guess like he just goes after 

3506
02:29:51,610 --> 02:29:53,780
people.
He just has a temper,

3507
02:29:54,140 --> 02:29:55,580
you know,
you have problems with them.

3508
02:29:58,100 --> 02:30:01,830
I've just made a lot of people know,
you know,

3509
02:30:02,100 --> 02:30:07,100
your buddy now.
Either people is that magical problems 

3510
02:30:07,100 --> 02:30:07,810
with them?
I don't know.

3511
02:30:08,390 --> 02:30:10,300
Problems.
I just avoid them.

3512
02:30:10,301 --> 02:30:11,890
When you told them you're buddying up 
with them.

3513
02:30:12,160 --> 02:30:17,160
I just closed my fucking head because I 
knew that was going to be a disaster 

3514
02:30:17,160 --> 02:30:18,480
because just,
just why?

3515
02:30:18,600 --> 02:30:19,210
Why?
Well,

3516
02:30:19,211 --> 02:30:21,250
I was just going to do his podcast.
So I like him.

3517
02:30:21,251 --> 02:30:22,240
I looked at,
I said,

3518
02:30:22,241 --> 02:30:24,460
I think he's funny.
He's got great impressions.

3519
02:30:24,610 --> 02:30:29,610
That dude that does the best.
Christopher walken on the fucking face 

3520
02:30:29,610 --> 02:30:29,730
of the planet.
He's a,

3521
02:30:29,740 --> 02:30:32,540
he's got a Hilarious Colin Quinn,
his Collin Quinn is.

3522
02:30:32,541 --> 02:30:35,770
This is funny as colony Quinn.
I mean I think he's a talented guy.

3523
02:30:35,771 --> 02:30:38,590
He's Kevin.
I don't know.

3524
02:30:38,591 --> 02:30:39,490
It's not the commerce.
Oh,

3525
02:30:39,491 --> 02:30:42,070
look what I know.
I know that's the problem.

3526
02:30:42,130 --> 02:30:47,130
I have to judge them.
I have to judge them based on my 

3527
02:30:47,130 --> 02:30:47,980
interactions and my interactions with 
him have always been cool.

3528
02:30:47,980 --> 02:30:49,990
He's always been nice to me.
I've never had a problem with them.

3529
02:30:49,991 --> 02:30:51,970
He's always been cool with me,
but you know,

3530
02:30:51,971 --> 02:30:56,971
I don't like reading all that shit.
I don't like seeing anybody doing shit 

3531
02:30:56,971 --> 02:30:59,210
like that.
But you did that to Brian to you know,

3532
02:30:59,220 --> 02:31:00,910
you,
you wouldn't have to Brian to on twitter

3533
02:31:01,070 --> 02:31:06,070
just the same way back,
but it's the same fucking way he went 

3534
02:31:06,070 --> 02:31:07,450
after him on twitter the exact same way 
that you're criticizing right here.

3535
02:31:07,660 --> 02:31:12,660
First of all,
I didn't know what was really going on 

3536
02:31:12,660 --> 02:31:14,910
and if you want to really know Brian,
it was these motherfuckers that got us 

3537
02:31:14,910 --> 02:31:16,810
all going because me and you will cool.
Who's calling me back?

3538
02:31:17,050 --> 02:31:20,160
All these outside forces that we call 
our [inaudible] friends

3539
02:31:20,400 --> 02:31:22,630
were the ones that with twitter,
me and st all this shit.

3540
02:31:22,631 --> 02:31:26,700
So next time you sit on a fucking tell 
you and that's why I got pissed off when

3541
02:31:26,701 --> 02:31:29,130
I went to Jerry's that night and that 
dude came up to me.

3542
02:31:29,131 --> 02:31:31,410
That's what got me pissed off because 
you're my brother.

3543
02:31:31,440 --> 02:31:32,820
You want me?
Never had a fucking problem.

3544
02:31:32,821 --> 02:31:35,090
We goof around all the fucking time.
That's why when,

3545
02:31:35,091 --> 02:31:37,290
when they told me that you were furious 
and stuff,

3546
02:31:37,320 --> 02:31:39,330
I got hurt.
I called you right away.

3547
02:31:39,630 --> 02:31:41,220
I called you right away.
There's no.

3548
02:31:41,221 --> 02:31:45,090
You know what I mean?
I call or I show up.

3549
02:31:45,120 --> 02:31:46,980
That's the worst thing about it.
I love showing up.

3550
02:31:47,720 --> 02:31:48,960
Guys.
Just haven't found it right here,

3551
02:31:50,280 --> 02:31:51,240
bro.
I love you to death.

3552
02:31:51,241 --> 02:31:55,700
And then I left him like every fucking 
nothing like that though.

3553
02:31:56,130 --> 02:31:57,140
I know.
You know.

3554
02:31:57,150 --> 02:32:02,150
Listen Bro.
That's why I don't deal with a lot of 

3555
02:32:02,150 --> 02:32:03,711
these fucking guys because I know it's 
going to end up and this is the type of 

3556
02:32:03,711 --> 02:32:04,080
person I am.
I don't know how that deal.

3557
02:32:04,320 --> 02:32:06,270
I don't know how to argue that.
I don't know how to go to court.

3558
02:32:06,770 --> 02:32:10,170
I don't know how to play those games.
Those are not games that I grew up plan.

3559
02:32:10,380 --> 02:32:13,100
So when people throw that at me or be 
bureaucratics,

3560
02:32:13,140 --> 02:32:15,090
whatever the fuck that word is,
I can't deal with that.

3561
02:32:15,590 --> 02:32:16,830
Talk to me.
I know,

3562
02:32:16,890 --> 02:32:21,890
I know,
but just come talk to me like a man 

3563
02:32:21,890 --> 02:32:21,890
because if you don't know that,
I suspect

3564
02:32:24,060 --> 02:32:26,230
if they don't come talk to me like a 
man,

3565
02:32:26,290 --> 02:32:26,750
Brian,

3566
02:32:27,140 --> 02:32:32,140
they don't come talk to you like a man.
Then you got to suspect that containers 

3567
02:32:32,140 --> 02:32:36,340
and then you don't want after a while 
they want to do it on them because I 

3568
02:32:36,340 --> 02:32:37,160
know like my mom used to say if it sucks
in the beginning it's gonna suck all the

3569
02:32:37,161 --> 02:32:38,810
way through.
So just leave it alone.

3570
02:32:39,060 --> 02:32:40,670
If you have a bad week the first day 
with them,

3571
02:32:40,940 --> 02:32:45,940
you know what?
This is going to suck all the way 

3572
02:32:45,940 --> 02:32:49,601
through.
So let's just shaking part friends 

3573
02:32:49,601 --> 02:32:49,601
because why put yourself

3574
02:32:49,601 --> 02:32:53,020
through the shit before I start getting 
angry at someone is not here again.

3575
02:32:56,800 --> 02:32:58,450
I'll tell you,
I was fucking 12 years old.

3576
02:32:58,480 --> 02:33:00,430
I told that cock sucker.
Then I'll tell you now,

3577
02:33:01,360 --> 02:33:03,220
ladies and gentlemen,
play the music.

3578
02:33:03,221 --> 02:33:04,520
Let's,
let's wrap this bitch up.

3579
02:33:04,530 --> 02:33:09,530
Let's bring this mother fucker home.
Let's bring it home in a positive 

3580
02:33:09,530 --> 02:33:09,530
direction.
Joe Diaz,

3581
02:33:09,530 --> 02:33:14,460
and I know you said something on twitter
the other day that people will talk 

3582
02:33:14,460 --> 02:33:15,630
about positivity or probably concert.
They all really are really,

3583
02:33:15,720 --> 02:33:17,170
really.
I talk about that shit.

3584
02:33:18,940 --> 02:33:23,940
You gotta lighten up,
but you got to stop beating on my 

3585
02:33:23,940 --> 02:33:25,130
fucking cough drops.
You came over here and yellow,

3586
02:33:25,150 --> 02:33:26,860
100,000
negative things today.

3587
02:33:26,861 --> 02:33:29,250
Don't you tell me what to be positive 
and negative.

3588
02:33:31,440 --> 02:33:33,700
No,
it helps people.

3589
02:33:33,701 --> 02:33:37,570
It helps people recognize that other 
people like to think that way too.

3590
02:33:38,990 --> 02:33:39,370
Yeah,
yeah.

3591
02:33:39,430 --> 02:33:40,840
I'm talking about whatever the fuck I 
want.

3592
02:33:40,841 --> 02:33:42,040
I got a podcast.
Bitch.

3593
02:33:42,190 --> 02:33:47,190
You can't stop me.
You can't tell me what the fuck they 

3594
02:33:47,190 --> 02:33:47,190
talking about.
I'm going to keep it going.

3595
02:33:47,190 --> 02:33:48,510
I'm going to keep the bumping.
Ladies and gentlemen,
