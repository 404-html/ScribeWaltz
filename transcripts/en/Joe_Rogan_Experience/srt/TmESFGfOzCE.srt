1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,650
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:02,960
I love dogs too.

3
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:03,980
I love animals and this,

4
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:06,870
that's something that people
have a weird problem with,

5
00:00:06,871 --> 00:00:09,600
but they don't have a weird problem with
loving animals and then feeding their

6
00:00:09,601 --> 00:00:09,961
animals.

7
00:00:09,961 --> 00:00:10,381
Animals.

8
00:00:10,381 --> 00:00:14,580
Like I have friends who fucking are
vegans and they have cats and I'm like,

9
00:00:14,581 --> 00:00:19,581
do you under fucking stand that
cats only eat meat like a dog?

10
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:21,240
A dog can eat carrots,

11
00:00:21,241 --> 00:00:22,470
a dog can eat grains.

12
00:00:22,471 --> 00:00:23,490
Got dogs eat rice.

13
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:28,520
Like I have a friend who cooks for his
dog and he gets his dog ground beef and

14
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:33,390
mixes it with potatoes and
rice and it's delicious.

15
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:34,290
You do that for your dog.

16
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:34,900
Oh cool.

17
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:36,330
It's doesn't eight probably herself,

18
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:36,900
but,

19
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:39,270
but you can't do that with a
cat if you can do with the cat.

20
00:00:39,271 --> 00:00:41,550
It has to be just animal protein.

21
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:42,031
That's it.

22
00:00:42,031 --> 00:00:43,830
That's really the only thing
that cat is allowed to eat.

23
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:44,491
Yeah.

24
00:00:44,491 --> 00:00:46,380
You can't feed cats grains.

25
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:49,740
Cats are not supposed to eat the
rice that's supposed to eat carrots.

26
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:54,000
Catsi fish and they eat chicken and
the beef and the liver and they eat.

27
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:55,590
They eat animal protein,

28
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:57,430
they're carnivores.

29
00:00:57,450 --> 00:00:58,770
They're straight carnivores.

30
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:02,910
So for you to be a Vegan and have
a fucking cat living in your house,

31
00:01:02,911 --> 00:01:05,610
like you're involved in
the killing of animals,

32
00:01:05,611 --> 00:01:06,660
whether you like it or not.

33
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:07,201
I mean,

34
00:01:07,201 --> 00:01:09,660
I guess there's probably
some Vegan cat food,

35
00:01:09,661 --> 00:01:10,980
but I can't imagine it.

36
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:12,600
Let's go kill it right now.

37
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:13,530
Probably kill the cat.

38
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:14,670
It's probably not good.

39
00:01:14,671 --> 00:01:17,160
Vegan cat food bad.

40
00:01:17,161 --> 00:01:17,360
Let's,

41
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,560
let's look up that cash.

42
00:01:18,561 --> 00:01:19,394
Where the Dylan?

43
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:20,080
Yeah,

44
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:20,700
fast.

45
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,440
That's one of my two five days cats.

46
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:23,340
Okay.

47
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:24,780
Vegan cat food.

48
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:25,803
You know,

49
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:26,501
I just went up.

50
00:01:26,501 --> 00:01:28,560
Imagine that shit is not good.

51
00:01:28,561 --> 00:01:30,060
That basically mini lines.

52
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:31,250
Oh look it.

53
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:32,083
He says actually,

54
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,190
and the Vegan cat foods
contained adequate amounts.

55
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,080
Is it okay to raise a cat vegan?

56
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:39,720
I think it's hilarious.

57
00:01:39,721 --> 00:01:40,554
Fellow.

58
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:44,400
Other thing that is bugging Alaris now
artists into activists with more than one

59
00:01:44,401 --> 00:01:45,630
field on the family in Ithaca,

60
00:01:45,631 --> 00:01:46,380
New York.

61
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:47,520
More in her partner.

62
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:48,750
Shariah Golding.

63
00:01:48,751 --> 00:01:49,561
That means our lives.

64
00:01:49,561 --> 00:01:50,100
Friends.

65
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,030
What a surprise.

66
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,830
Lesbian vegans with cats,

67
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:53,760
that's crazy.

68
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:55,020
You never hear about that.

69
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:56,640
Relatively small,

70
00:01:56,641 --> 00:02:00,660
but deeply dedicated group of Vegan pet
owners who believe their cats and dogs

71
00:02:00,661 --> 00:02:01,040
dies.

72
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,150
She reflect their own beliefs.

73
00:02:03,151 --> 00:02:06,780
About the treatment of animals and
the environmentally sustainable,

74
00:02:06,781 --> 00:02:08,190
sustainable lifestyles.

75
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,450
Is it okay to give your diet
of spare me all the Foa,

76
00:02:12,451 --> 00:02:13,284
outrage,

77
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,390
outrage of the billions of land,

78
00:02:15,391 --> 00:02:18,870
animals and trillions of sea animals
tortured and killed each year in the u s

79
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,930
alone for food to feed people and pets?

80
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,520
I don't know man.

81
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:24,060
You know,

82
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,580
you leave a cat outside that
cat's gonna kill a bird.

83
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:27,151
That,

84
00:02:27,151 --> 00:02:29,310
that's sweet kitty cat that
you have as a murderer.

85
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,360
Yeah,

86
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,040
my cat makes these crazy noises.

87
00:02:32,041 --> 00:02:33,030
When he looks outside,

88
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:35,010
he sees like something like a squirrel.

89
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:36,140
His whole jaw starts.

90
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:37,920
He starts,

91
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,930
their jaws start moving up and down.

92
00:02:39,931 --> 00:02:42,270
Like they can't help it if they're
just thinking about biting.

93
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,220
I it.

94
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,840
If you've had fight dreams,

95
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:47,370
like what you wake up kicking,

96
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:48,060
you know,

97
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:48,893
you know those dreams.

98
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:49,500
Well,

99
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:53,550
cats have those when they see a fucking
animal that they want to kill because

100
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:54,403
it's like that.

101
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,380
They have reflex.

102
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:56,910
I had cats,

103
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:57,773
they make noises

104
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:00,580
so it looks out the window.

105
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:04,720
Have you ever watched
them like stalk the stalk?

106
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:08,350
You stuck your leg and then watch a lion?

107
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:09,970
There is very little difference.

108
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,390
You're like a lion crawling through the
grass or a cat roll in three a carpet.

109
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:14,920
Yeah.

110
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,180
Like they look identical.

111
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:16,870
Oh yeah.

112
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:17,710
Absolutely identical.

113
00:03:17,711 --> 00:03:18,371
They're murderers,

114
00:03:18,371 --> 00:03:19,140
bro.

115
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:21,390
They have fucking murderers apparently.

116
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:21,880
Um,

117
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:24,490
what they're saying is for a lot of these,

118
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:27,550
a lot of these people that
are there making these,

119
00:03:27,551 --> 00:03:27,791
uh,

120
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:29,800
these diets for these dogs,

121
00:03:29,801 --> 00:03:34,390
there's like a big debate whether
or not it's healthy for the dogs.

122
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:35,190
It's about the Vegas.

123
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:35,550
Yeah.

124
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:36,151
You can die.

125
00:03:36,151 --> 00:03:36,571
It's for,

126
00:03:36,571 --> 00:03:37,660
for dogs and cats,

127
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,220
whether or not it's a matter of,

128
00:03:39,221 --> 00:03:39,520
uh,

129
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:43,360
the animal getting all the
proper nutrients or just
being able to stay alive.

130
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:48,190
So I don't really understand people's
relationships with dogs in that sense.

131
00:03:48,191 --> 00:03:49,030
Like I get the whole,

132
00:03:49,031 --> 00:03:50,350
like men having a dog,

133
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:51,790
but as people get weird,

134
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:52,331
like we have,

135
00:03:52,331 --> 00:03:53,164
we know a,

136
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:53,591
um,

137
00:03:53,591 --> 00:03:58,570
a friend of a friend who told us to
have a patient who's got munch houses,

138
00:03:58,571 --> 00:03:59,440
you know which houses?

139
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:00,843
Yeah.

140
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:02,320
Basically.

141
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:07,060
So they basically make up things so
that you can get their dog operated on.

142
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:11,740
Like it's just like as an problem so
that they have an excuse to get an

143
00:04:11,741 --> 00:04:12,580
operation on the door,

144
00:04:12,581 --> 00:04:13,414
right?

145
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,500
Like it's like the kid

146
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:16,810
get away.

147
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:21,130
Apparently what they're saying is that
dogs and cats have a much different

148
00:04:21,131 --> 00:04:24,790
nutritional requirement and
human beings and that the,

149
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:24,971
uh,

150
00:04:24,971 --> 00:04:27,940
they need much higher protein
intake than a human does.

151
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:33,220
So especially dogs can eat a bunch of
other shit like yams and potatoes and all

152
00:04:33,221 --> 00:04:36,490
these different things and it's okay as
long as they get sufficient amount of

153
00:04:36,491 --> 00:04:36,791
protein,

154
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:40,750
but it's almost impossible to get the
amount of protein that a dog needs with

155
00:04:40,751 --> 00:04:44,530
just plants and cats to fucking joke.

156
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:45,460
Cancer,

157
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:46,170
you know,

158
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:46,631
here's what,

159
00:04:46,631 --> 00:04:47,320
you know,

160
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:47,710
put,

161
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:50,680
put layouts of fucking meat
and lay out a bowl of beans.

162
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,020
See where fluffy goes.

163
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:54,191
Oh,

164
00:04:54,191 --> 00:04:54,521
fluffy.

165
00:04:54,521 --> 00:04:54,701
No,

166
00:04:54,701 --> 00:04:55,560
you're not a murderer.

167
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:56,403
Fluffy.

168
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:59,440
The just choking down
these pieces of meat,

169
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:00,490
you know,

170
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:04,000
have the yams fluffy fucking ridiculous

171
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:06,363
cat food.

172
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,410
Shut the fuck up.

173
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,660
That thing's a murderer,

174
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:10,060
man.

175
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,260
You're going to keep it.

176
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,760
Keep it from being a murderer.

177
00:05:12,761 --> 00:05:12,971
It's,

178
00:05:12,971 --> 00:05:13,810
it's nature.

179
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:14,680
I mean,

180
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,220
you know,

181
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:16,390
it's what it does.

182
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,980
That's what the cat does.

183
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:18,761
It's kind of comedy,

184
00:05:18,761 --> 00:05:20,650
like everybody who's been pushing all the,

185
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:24,580
like the Tofu and all the soy stuff
over the last couple of years,

186
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,430
it started to get breast cancer in men.

187
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:28,203
It's just,

188
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,680
they're discovering it's bad for you.

189
00:05:29,681 --> 00:05:32,830
I say that stuff instead of
milk and I'd always feel sick,

190
00:05:32,831 --> 00:05:33,191
but I was like,

191
00:05:33,191 --> 00:05:34,090
it's gotta be healthy feed.

192
00:05:34,091 --> 00:05:35,140
Everyone keeps telling me that.

193
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:37,810
That's why I have boobs.

194
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:40,090
Yeah.

195
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:43,810
Even vegan cats.com is telling
people to feed their cats meet.

196
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,240
That's when shit gets real.

197
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:50,550
When Vegan cats.com tells
people to feed their cats,

198
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:52,480
meet after much soul searching,

199
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:54,740
we've decided that we
need to keep our cats.

200
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,190
We only feed them asshole

201
00:05:58,250 --> 00:05:59,083
cows.

202
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:09,720
Okay.
