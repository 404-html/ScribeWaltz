1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:00,960
Hey shuttle,

2
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:01,680
we got,

3
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:03,320
we got down Joe Diaz,

4
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:04,200
we went deep.

5
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:05,490
We just kept smoking.

6
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:07,290
It didn't do shit to me.

7
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:08,600
Well you got to break up the gate.

8
00:00:08,601 --> 00:00:08,811
We've,

9
00:00:08,811 --> 00:00:09,800
when I come up here Doug,

10
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:10,731
what are you talking about?

11
00:00:10,731 --> 00:00:11,040
Right?

12
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,840
That we just don't do shit to me.

13
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:14,700
If you make me drive 40 minutes up,

14
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:15,990
you've got to get me stolen bro.

15
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:16,801
That's us.

16
00:00:16,801 --> 00:00:16,981
What?

17
00:00:16,981 --> 00:00:18,540
Hannah weed I've been
telling you about that shit.

18
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:19,110
Yeah,

19
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:20,910
you brought that shit to
the ice house to that shit.

20
00:00:20,911 --> 00:00:23,010
Don't do nothing to you
and you're so crazy.

21
00:00:23,011 --> 00:00:24,270
It's true to go to a doctor,

22
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:25,113
the fuck dog

23
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:29,150
dog.

24
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:33,750
You got to bust ass and good weed dog
enough is enough with this shit around

25
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:35,230
like Jack you.

26
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:36,913
No it's not.

27
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,040
Look at my fucking eyes bro.

28
00:00:38,041 --> 00:00:39,020
I look high to you guys

29
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:43,710
cause I smoke on the way cause I knew you
were going to give me that such plan a

30
00:00:43,711 --> 00:00:44,544
fucking weed.

31
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:45,751
Yo Man,

32
00:00:45,751 --> 00:00:46,800
I don't think they heard you.

33
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,300
Don't you tell them what your name is?

34
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:54,280
I would like to know my too is when
I have three thinking nothing else.

35
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:55,373
It's amazing.

36
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:55,830
You know,

37
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:56,730
women realize that,

38
00:00:56,731 --> 00:00:56,941
you know,

39
00:00:56,941 --> 00:01:01,170
when they realize that when they try to
become men like leg Chaz Bono and don't,

40
00:01:01,171 --> 00:01:02,004
like I said today,

41
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:04,990
he can't fucking just strap a pair
nugget town and go out there and sling.

42
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:08,550
I always fucking know
that you're the real deal.

43
00:01:08,551 --> 00:01:11,100
You know who you can and you've
been sucking Dick for 20 years now.

44
00:01:11,101 --> 00:01:12,870
You want to change fucking governments.

45
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:15,060
You can't do that shit.

46
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:17,700
You can change government
changing government.

47
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:21,960
20 years ago I went to a club to
get Quain loot and I walked in,

48
00:01:21,961 --> 00:01:22,441
I never forget,

49
00:01:22,441 --> 00:01:22,830
there's like a,

50
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:23,780
it was called Ramrod.

51
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:25,200
There was a gay bar in the city.

52
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:26,191
We were kids.

53
00:01:26,191 --> 00:01:30,390
We were like 18 and I walked into this
club and before we walked in there was a

54
00:01:30,391 --> 00:01:33,930
fetish club on the side and there was
a guy in a tub that had a sign on them

55
00:01:33,931 --> 00:01:35,400
that said spit on me.

56
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:38,010
That was his fetish for
people to spit on him.

57
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:39,480
So here's the beauty.

58
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:40,530
I'm standing there,

59
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:40,891
you know,

60
00:01:40,891 --> 00:01:41,760
your joy is gone.

61
00:01:41,761 --> 00:01:42,594
You're drinking.

62
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:43,880
You know you had a pea and Austin,

63
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:46,320
they see 20 guys standing on
line for the fucking bathroom,

64
00:01:46,321 --> 00:01:46,801
and I asked him,

65
00:01:46,801 --> 00:01:46,981
I go,

66
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:47,700
listen,

67
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:50,670
why don't you just ask the guy
in the Tub if we could pee on?

68
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:52,260
So I walked over to the guy,

69
00:01:52,261 --> 00:01:52,410
look,

70
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:53,243
can I ask you a question?

71
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:54,720
Do you mind if we pray on you?

72
00:01:54,721 --> 00:01:55,680
The guys go right ahead.

73
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:57,510
There was a point in the
night I looked at him,

74
00:01:57,511 --> 00:02:00,200
he had a circle of guys just bringing
all those guys that don't want to wait on

75
00:02:00,201 --> 00:02:00,840
line.

76
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,351
Like fuck it,

77
00:02:01,351 --> 00:02:02,184
just piano.

78
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:05,060
When I left to go ahead and three
inches of p in the fucking dog,

79
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,230
if the sign was all fucking and melted,

80
00:02:07,231 --> 00:02:10,960
this guy wanted people to spill out and
we ended up pissing on it and I pissed

81
00:02:10,961 --> 00:02:11,850
down and I'm guilty of,

82
00:02:11,851 --> 00:02:12,420
I don't give a fuck.

83
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:13,280
It is decided by Deka,

84
00:02:13,281 --> 00:02:14,190
Latin in North Bergen,

85
00:02:14,191 --> 00:02:14,641
New Jersey.

86
00:02:14,641 --> 00:02:15,780
These cops got together.

87
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:16,261
There's,

88
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:19,860
I'm from a real corrupt police town and
they call this bar the Meadowlands in

89
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:23,640
and there was a gogo bond only avenue
and on Wednesday night it was erotic

90
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:24,990
banana night for two bucks.

91
00:02:24,991 --> 00:02:27,960
They give you a frozen banana
and you walk into the Strip club,

92
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:28,771
you peel the banana,

93
00:02:28,771 --> 00:02:29,604
you gave it to the chick,

94
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:30,750
she shoved in a pussy,

95
00:02:30,751 --> 00:02:32,720
she gave it back to you
ate it at Christmas.

96
00:02:32,721 --> 00:02:33,551
He was always in there.

97
00:02:33,551 --> 00:02:35,560
One year I go in there and I'm sad.

98
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:35,911
The bottom,

99
00:02:35,911 --> 00:02:39,390
this is old guy that had like a stage in
the middle and then you sit around the

100
00:02:39,391 --> 00:02:39,751
side,

101
00:02:39,751 --> 00:02:41,630
but the chicks would put
their foot and climb over.

102
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:43,370
That's how this is 1980 dog.

103
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:45,870
This was strictly as you could
kill a bitch in a strip club.

104
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:46,703
You know what I'm saying?

105
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:51,150
In a strip club rod and
$50 that was on the menu

106
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:54,090
and if 50 get to kill me,

107
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:06,640
that would be 60 I'm about 16 I calm
my little pussy bow as a professional.

108
00:03:06,641 --> 00:03:07,690
I didn't know about the dirty things.

109
00:03:07,691 --> 00:03:08,000
I lied.

110
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,550
I'm saying this mother fucker took his,

111
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:15,520
she took his false teeth up and stuck
them in a snatch and put them back.

112
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:17,590
Then he put them in his
mouth on Christmas Eve.

113
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:22,150
I love people who think they're going
to be the year with test those fucking

114
00:03:22,151 --> 00:03:22,600
clowns.

115
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,710
Kevin Randleman was awesome.

116
00:03:23,711 --> 00:03:24,340
It was primal.

117
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:27,030
I love those fucking clowns
cause I was with them.

118
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,770
I always thought I was a
little bit BB does system.

119
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:33,640
I used to drink vinegar now I used
to do an eight ball on Friday,

120
00:03:33,641 --> 00:03:37,360
eight ball and Sam and then they would
have to test me on Monday for federal

121
00:03:37,361 --> 00:03:39,370
probation or Wednesday or Friday.

122
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:41,770
I could make the pis tache Wednesday,

123
00:03:41,771 --> 00:03:46,771
but there's no way I can make rock candy
coming out of high was fucking vinegar.

124
00:03:47,171 --> 00:03:52,171
Flavored rock can always
get white distilled vinegar
with a bottle of Gatorade

125
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:53,950
and I'd be cranberries,

126
00:03:53,951 --> 00:03:56,070
but I try.

127
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,790
So then I failed actress and
I came up with another idea.

128
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:01,830
I forget about drinking.

129
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:05,740
I'm going to take my own circumcised
Dick and I'm going to pull the skin back

130
00:04:05,741 --> 00:04:07,240
and I'm going to pull
them my products in there.

131
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:09,820
I thought it out and I said to myself,

132
00:04:09,821 --> 00:04:13,510
what kills piss on the floor rocks,

133
00:04:13,511 --> 00:04:14,980
but I can't sneak that as the money.

134
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:16,421
I said,

135
00:04:16,421 --> 00:04:18,400
what's the next best thing to kill pace?

136
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,170
So I figured out pool cleaners.

137
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:23,950
So I went to my buddy's
house who had a pool,

138
00:04:23,951 --> 00:04:25,240
you know those big things that you say,

139
00:04:25,241 --> 00:04:26,770
oh no rain.

140
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,633
And I grabbed it.

141
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:30,190
I drive it,

142
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:31,120
that motherfucker.

143
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:35,500
And I took my little skin on my helmet
and I pulled my back before I went to

144
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:36,343
probation,

145
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:39,520
my Dick and I just poured all the,

146
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:41,650
the whole fucking thing on my dick

147
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:46,420
and they'd pull the skin off and
I try like a rubber band that

148
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:53,410
I walk into probation piss Mr piece.

149
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:57,600
I take that dig out and I'd pop that
skin back and all that mold chain,

150
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:01,030
old bus goes in there and that
thing starts breathing on his own.

151
00:05:01,031 --> 00:05:01,190
Boom,

152
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:01,750
boom,

153
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:02,290
boom.

154
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:03,220
I put the cap on it.

155
00:05:03,221 --> 00:05:04,180
The thing is on his desk,

156
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,570
he could see my fucking,

157
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:07,830
you could see like shaking.

158
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:08,111
I'm like,

159
00:05:08,111 --> 00:05:08,944
I gotta get well,

160
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:09,843
great to see it.

161
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:11,703
Do you know what?

162
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:13,030
I still came back positive.

163
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,740
The chlorine the next day didn't hurt.

164
00:05:14,741 --> 00:05:17,290
I went right to the halfway
house and wash my dick off,

165
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,850
but the next day I went
to the business by,

166
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:19,960
Dick was like one of those.

167
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:22,660
This was coming out of everywhere.

168
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:22,981
What is it,

169
00:05:22,981 --> 00:05:24,190
how I store holders.

170
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:29,190
Then the last thing I figured it
was Draino so I took drain on.

171
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,260
I bought it on my big dog home.

172
00:05:31,261 --> 00:05:32,600
My and I went down there.

173
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:36,520
I had fucking pissed with
the Draino and this time dog.

174
00:05:36,521 --> 00:05:40,570
The thing was turning red right in front
of me and about four days later I get a

175
00:05:40,571 --> 00:05:41,404
call,

176
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,071
Mr. Diaz,

177
00:05:42,071 --> 00:05:43,360
can you come down to probation?

178
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:45,250
I thought there were going
to handcuff me a probation.

179
00:05:45,251 --> 00:05:45,791
I get any,

180
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:46,624
there's a car,

181
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:48,670
there's a probation officer and
they got to go into the check.

182
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:50,170
There was a chick that I
really liked when she goes,

183
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:51,491
I don't know what you did,

184
00:05:51,491 --> 00:05:56,230
but you fucking broke the machine this
time I really literally broke the testing

185
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:57,093
thing they had.

186
00:05:57,410 --> 00:05:58,131
They couldn't even,

187
00:05:58,131 --> 00:05:59,690
they didn't know what was in my system.

188
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:00,650
Some dog.

189
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:01,700
My Dick was rare.

190
00:06:01,701 --> 00:06:02,540
For a fucking month.

191
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:04,280
I get away with this shit.

192
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:06,710
The saddest moment of your
life is when your dick a sore.

193
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:07,970
It was something wrong with your debt.

194
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:09,050
Realize what have I done.

195
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:13,910
And on the weekends he cuts your fucking
Dick off and puts that fucking monkey

196
00:06:13,911 --> 00:06:14,091
that,

197
00:06:14,091 --> 00:06:18,170
that checkout we met in Vegas with the
artificial turf and the fucking hole that

198
00:06:18,171 --> 00:06:18,570
time,

199
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:22,820
remember rather Riviera's member
revealed the security came and tapped.

200
00:06:22,821 --> 00:06:24,830
As you're talking to a fucking Harvey,

201
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:26,270
don't get confused.

202
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:26,810
Nothing.

203
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:27,870
Beat that dirty oil.

204
00:06:27,871 --> 00:06:29,000
He's the day from Michigan.

205
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:30,470
That's the crazy bitch.

206
00:06:30,471 --> 00:06:33,330
I was fucking in the ass in Seattle
and I felt something hit my deck.

207
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,440
So I looked at her asshole
like stuck like two fingers,

208
00:06:36,441 --> 00:06:38,060
like something was hitting
the top of my unit.

209
00:06:38,061 --> 00:06:38,331
I'm like,

210
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:39,710
what the fuck is this sharp thing?

211
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:41,910
So I took my dick,

212
00:06:41,911 --> 00:06:41,991
I,

213
00:06:41,991 --> 00:06:42,824
she's like,

214
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,230
I just put two fingers and
they searched around her.

215
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:49,270
So I far like a fucking little like a,

216
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,500
you know when you need a
Hershey's bothered aluminum foil.

217
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:55,010
I incisors like half of
it and I took it out,

218
00:06:55,011 --> 00:06:58,370
but it was all wrinkled up and it was
like this was pointing over here and I

219
00:06:58,371 --> 00:06:59,660
just took it out and look at it.

220
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:01,040
It was like curly brownish.

221
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:05,360
I put on the table by taking back in
there and I'm going to send them to it is

222
00:07:05,361 --> 00:07:07,040
how you tell somebody to
have a little bit era.

223
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:12,770
Did you steal my change jar in the late
nineties probably did steal my fucking

224
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:13,940
change jar

225
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:19,490
jar.

226
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:21,380
I call you Joey jingles for awhile.

227
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:26,030
I would never ride change
a fucking cup of cheese.

228
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:27,081
Yeah,

229
00:07:27,081 --> 00:07:28,420
I was just bored as

230
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:33,170
fuck is wrong with that job.

231
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:34,010
A professional.

232
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:35,450
I've never watched the twilight,

233
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:38,210
but I've seen what those two little
fucking half of fruit cakes look like.

234
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:41,900
I can't believe that vampires and my
day vampire is a bad motherfucker.

235
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,820
Bottom is college that's available.

236
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,330
I just went deep

237
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,073
shadows.

238
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:50,061
Fuck guys.

239
00:07:50,061 --> 00:07:50,894
You fuck chicks?

240
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:51,591
It don't matter.

241
00:07:51,591 --> 00:07:52,340
You a vampire.

242
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:53,173
You Ain't gay.

243
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,200
You just slinked Dick.

244
00:07:54,201 --> 00:07:55,190
You fucking dogs.

245
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:57,530
You were fucking animal.

246
00:07:57,531 --> 00:07:58,850
You've got to fucking go and New York.

247
00:07:58,910 --> 00:07:59,211
Yeah,

248
00:07:59,211 --> 00:08:01,510
you got to go stop sign.

249
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:03,901
How they do here.

250
00:08:03,901 --> 00:08:04,581
Like no,

251
00:08:04,581 --> 00:08:07,040
you go get the fuck somebody fucking gold.

252
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:07,883
Right.

253
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:09,560
I got to get to the weed store.

254
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:10,611
It is a great story.

255
00:08:10,611 --> 00:08:11,180
I just thought it was,

256
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:15,710
cause I was thinking that standing up
on the way up here and a friend Mike was

257
00:08:15,711 --> 00:08:18,290
selling weed and then one time
he worked at CAA and he goes,

258
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:18,561
listen,

259
00:08:18,561 --> 00:08:19,680
one of the interns over to him,

260
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:20,533
he blew up.

261
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,800
He ended up being
Whitney Houston's manager

262
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:27,110
in the tour manager and
he's looking for powder.

263
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:32,000
So every day they would come over and
I would sell Bobby Brown and Whitney

264
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,370
Houston,

265
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:32,630
you know,

266
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:35,480
they would come over like
$1,100 which was per diem money.

267
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:37,850
I was taking Whitney's per diem money,

268
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:38,160
right?

269
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:41,510
Every day they come out with a little
white envelope and give me the per diem

270
00:08:41,511 --> 00:08:45,470
money that go up to the Martell
cartel and I buy 14 grams of Blo,

271
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:48,980
take an eight ball out and cut it
and then give it to Whitney Houston.

272
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:51,200
And they were fucking going crazy thing.

273
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:52,910
This went on for 30 40 days,

274
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,111
but I couldn't smell it.

275
00:08:54,111 --> 00:08:54,944
All the blogs,

276
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:57,660
I couldn't store it.

277
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:58,500
It was just too much.

278
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:01,830
Then picking me up and nine or more
than page of me on the Red Pager.

279
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,300
I'm coming downstairs,

280
00:09:03,301 --> 00:09:04,160
getting in a car with them,

281
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,810
going through the Martell
cards out to them,

282
00:09:05,811 --> 00:09:09,810
brothers going in the house with two
grams of coke or when he cut in my pocket

283
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:12,240
and I would just go in and take rock sack,

284
00:09:12,241 --> 00:09:14,240
throw the cutter and mix it up
and give it right back to them,

285
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:14,551
the car,

286
00:09:14,551 --> 00:09:15,570
and they'd be happy as shit.

287
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,120
I was selling them.

288
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:21,390
I was getting him a half ounce and
taking an eight ball out and throwing an

289
00:09:21,391 --> 00:09:22,320
eight ball or cut it.

290
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:24,240
What does enable three and a half grams,

291
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:27,450
but this is the eighth they're
doing a half ounce a day,

292
00:09:27,451 --> 00:09:28,980
which is three ounces a week.

293
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,000
Oh my God.

294
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:34,110
It's senior to the pages going
off and it's sage and I said,

295
00:09:34,111 --> 00:09:34,441
fuck it.

296
00:09:34,441 --> 00:09:37,800
Let me just bring the two ounces to
our house and blew up and I brought,

297
00:09:37,801 --> 00:09:38,431
at that time,

298
00:09:38,431 --> 00:09:40,650
it was like an ounce and
a half and three quarters.

299
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:45,540
This bitch pick me up at six in the
morning with a case of Starbuck coffee in

300
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:45,900
Canada,

301
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,130
half a gown on the backend,

302
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:52,790
and we went back to their house and we
did that whole package of blo heroin,

303
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:54,080
alliums,

304
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:55,541
BMA,

305
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:56,500
a GSP.

306
00:09:57,310 --> 00:09:58,690
We did how many days,

307
00:09:58,691 --> 00:09:59,321
how many days,

308
00:09:59,321 --> 00:10:02,040
who days chases cry is got.

309
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:05,130
It was the fucking Houston's
kept calling me and I'm like,

310
00:10:05,131 --> 00:10:06,040
fuck you motherfuckers.

311
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:06,871
I'm out of commission.

312
00:10:06,871 --> 00:10:07,470
Right.

313
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:07,801
That's all.

314
00:10:07,801 --> 00:10:09,780
Finally that wix week was the grammys.

315
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:11,850
Last time ever I seen Whitney Houston.

316
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,170
I got a call on a Monday morning after
the grammys at nine in the morning and

317
00:10:16,171 --> 00:10:16,441
they're like,

318
00:10:16,441 --> 00:10:17,221
is your boy up?

319
00:10:17,221 --> 00:10:18,054
He'd have to be,

320
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:19,323
I'm getting me.

321
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:23,220
And they pull up to my fucking house
where I lived by the YFCA and it was the

322
00:10:23,221 --> 00:10:24,054
manager,

323
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:29,010
Whitney Houston and Ricky
Martin in the fucking back.

324
00:10:29,011 --> 00:10:29,970
And they're all gone.

325
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:32,010
They're gone from the Grammy's that jaw,

326
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:32,881
all of them,

327
00:10:32,881 --> 00:10:35,970
jaws or fucking go and Jack
and I got in the car with them.

328
00:10:35,971 --> 00:10:37,410
I drive for the Martell cocktail.

329
00:10:37,411 --> 00:10:38,070
I'm sitting there like,

330
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:38,430
oh,

331
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:39,550
I don't even know what drinking month.

332
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:40,950
I just looked out the window.

333
00:10:40,951 --> 00:10:42,480
I was more paranoid than he was.

334
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:43,561
I got in,

335
00:10:43,561 --> 00:10:45,060
bought it and brought
it back to the college.

336
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:45,200
Right.

337
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,890
That's the last time I fucking say eating.

338
00:10:46,891 --> 00:10:48,410
All this story's going
to get on the Internet.

339
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,433
You know?

340
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:53,100
11 years ago it wasn't,

341
00:10:53,101 --> 00:10:53,934
he wasn't going to say to me,

342
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:54,131
Oh,

343
00:10:54,131 --> 00:10:55,020
you remember me bitch.

344
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:58,240
What the Fuck Joe Rogan,

345
00:10:58,660 --> 00:10:59,890
why got to bothering me with this shit?

346
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:00,590
Well,

347
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:01,710
I was sitting there.

348
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:02,441
I would have the time,

349
00:11:02,441 --> 00:11:03,100
like gentlemen,

350
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,900
you got to talk to me
about chimps eating babies.

351
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:08,720
What the fuck kind of Bennett table
conversation is this cocksucker okay,

352
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:10,620
but it hit the fan every now and then.

353
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:12,120
You'd be in Jersey going,

354
00:11:12,121 --> 00:11:13,200
where the fuck are you?

355
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,520
I'm not going to lie to your dog.

356
00:11:14,521 --> 00:11:15,360
I never left Vegas,

357
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:21,023
but

358
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:24,990
I still remember when I was playing
kickball with Lucy Snowe Bush.

359
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:28,620
Real name Joey.

360
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:29,971
Not a real name.

361
00:11:29,971 --> 00:11:30,804
Fucks up.

362
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,480
Carly's big bitch,

363
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:34,890
but she was like five,

364
00:11:34,891 --> 00:11:35,640
eight grade.

365
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,510
I broke into Aslan and ate her pussy with,

366
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,433
I'll quit.

367
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:39,590
I just couldn't take it.

368
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:41,760
The bitch was banging my uncle.

369
00:11:41,761 --> 00:11:42,594
My mother died.

370
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:45,790
Very small grounds as Bob
Bender was Lucy small Bush

371
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:50,701
like old.

372
00:11:50,701 --> 00:11:52,380
Oh Susanna be right for me.

373
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,090
The door.

374
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:57,340
I knew she was out drinking so
she was going to say nothing.

375
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:58,720
I didn't jump on the bed.

376
00:11:58,721 --> 00:11:59,700
Ain't [inaudible].

377
00:11:59,701 --> 00:12:00,534
My

378
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:04,930
name is Lucy smoke and she
was fuck how grill was.

379
00:12:04,931 --> 00:12:05,764
Okay.

380
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:09,850
Bobby was bagging from the time she
was like seven ish was buying it.

381
00:12:09,851 --> 00:12:10,271
I was like,

382
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:10,451
Hey,

383
00:12:10,451 --> 00:12:11,210
I met her,

384
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:12,043
but she doesn't have what?

385
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:16,990
She used to have a on the
old one broke into her house.

386
00:12:16,991 --> 00:12:20,450
I was like 17 it was
walking down the house.

387
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:23,050
I'm thinking about who's
who see am I on the,

388
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,190
and I was out like she was out earlier.

389
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:27,301
Whenever she drank,

390
00:12:27,301 --> 00:12:28,360
she was kind of loose dog.

391
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:29,680
I went right into how you got,

392
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:29,940
oh,

393
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:30,773
ladder up,

394
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:32,150
climbed up the fucking ladder,

395
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:32,993
open the window.

396
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:33,401
She's like,

397
00:12:33,401 --> 00:12:33,911
who's there?

398
00:12:33,911 --> 00:12:37,120
Who's been the one either that
is fucking pull the pants.

399
00:12:37,121 --> 00:12:40,000
Eight a monkey climb back out
of like a fucking vampire.

400
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,610
She seemed like a week later she was like,

401
00:12:42,611 --> 00:12:43,444
that was amazing.

402
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:44,843
Yeah.

403
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:48,830
I don't know the movie he was
dancing and singing and Nick's,

404
00:12:48,831 --> 00:12:49,930
you know he's dying oxygen.

405
00:12:49,931 --> 00:12:50,420
No,

406
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:51,130
not not right,

407
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:51,960
but junkies and jumping.

408
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:52,930
He's a junkie is a junkie.

409
00:12:52,931 --> 00:12:56,950
Every day you guys are wake up singing
dance and then he has oxygen tanks at

410
00:12:56,951 --> 00:12:57,160
night.

411
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,120
Something's not right there.

412
00:12:58,810 --> 00:12:59,643
In my case,

413
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:01,060
like most schools,

414
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:03,480
you're worth more dead than
what you are alive yet.

415
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:06,240
I mean he's worth more
now than he's ever been.

416
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:08,650
I think he killed Michael Jackson.

417
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,290
What's changed where they go on Fox News?

418
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:13,060
Don't give a fuck no more.

419
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:14,540
Cause nobody's said that.

420
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:16,390
Say don't give a fuck.

421
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:19,270
Why would day so these
kids have coming back.

422
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:20,090
This is the worst.

423
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:21,640
It doesn't matter if they're addictions.

424
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:22,600
Cussing is what's bad.

425
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,180
You can't do nothing to me that
Castro hasn't already done.

426
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:26,330
And when this shit goes down,

427
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:27,240
isn't that in Scarface?

428
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:27,440
Yes.

429
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:27,701
Right.

430
00:13:27,701 --> 00:13:31,300
And I gotta record that mother fucker
right there on the flight afterwards and I

431
00:13:31,301 --> 00:13:32,620
had fucking them bag.

432
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,500
I know that for misconduct,

433
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:36,300
which if I had a little bag of
reefer referring my fucking no,

434
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:37,790
you didn't do this.

435
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:38,501
A conspiracy thing.

436
00:13:38,501 --> 00:13:40,300
This is just to show you
how hard do you have?

437
00:13:40,301 --> 00:13:42,310
What people are working with
that fucking x ray machine.

438
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:44,740
I had it in the bag here and
I put it under my left nut.

439
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:45,501
No.

440
00:13:45,501 --> 00:13:45,670
Okay.

441
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:46,630
We're not telling the story.

442
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:47,850
That's yes.

443
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:48,431
What freedom was.

444
00:13:48,431 --> 00:13:49,950
Breeze come all Obama right now,

445
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:50,740
mother.

446
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:51,071
They said,

447
00:13:51,071 --> 00:13:52,420
we're going to put you
to the extra machine.

448
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:56,410
I'm standing there sweating bullets
with this baggy under my fucking

449
00:13:58,090 --> 00:13:59,820
bigger than the right and
look cause I'm a righty stop.

450
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:00,281
People don't know.

451
00:14:00,281 --> 00:14:01,790
That's what I had cancer
for a couple of weeks.

452
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:04,990
You know the opposite hand is only
50 minutes in the control room.

453
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,720
When my legs open,

454
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:10,250
you're like Rodney danger

455
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,740
that was picking up a storm.

456
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:16,000
Not to mention my balls.

457
00:14:16,001 --> 00:14:18,350
I'm sweating now because
I'm going to go to jail time

458
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:21,430
and he shook my hand.

459
00:14:21,431 --> 00:14:21,761
I'm like,

460
00:14:21,761 --> 00:14:22,594
my tax payers.

461
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,420
A harder word.

462
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:23,770
Hey,

463
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:24,581
go fuck yourself.

464
00:14:24,581 --> 00:14:24,910
You've got,

465
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:25,241
hold on,

466
00:14:25,241 --> 00:14:26,010
hold on one second.

467
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:26,120
Hey,

468
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:26,710
good job.

469
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:27,430
Take a shuttle.

470
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:28,263
Joey Diaz,

471
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:29,263
Facebook.

472
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:31,630
Check yourself before you wreck yourself.

473
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:32,933
Fixing gas.

474
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:35,110
I get out of here.

475
00:14:35,111 --> 00:14:35,944
You're in trouble.

476
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,570
I'm powering fire.

477
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,190
I'm throwing.

478
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:40,400
All right.

479
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:40,990
All right.

480
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:41,680
Listen,

481
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,360
I'll stay black cause
that's the most important.

482
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:43,900
Okay.

483
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:44,733
Okay.

484
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:45,760
Hey Joe.

485
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,960
The second he leaves the room.

486
00:14:46,961 --> 00:14:48,580
I'm totally talking about how awesome.

487
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:55,940
Yes.
