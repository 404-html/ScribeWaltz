1
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:05,310
Hey of freaks, what's going on? Everybody?

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:08,970
This episode of the Joe Rogan
experience podcast is brought to you by

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,720
[inaudible] Dot Com
that's o. N N. I. T. A.

4
00:00:12,721 --> 00:00:15,330
I'm wearing on a tee shirt today
cause I'm accompanied bitch.

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,650
Now actually a own a part of
this company. Um, what on it is,

6
00:00:19,651 --> 00:00:21,480
is a human optimization website.

7
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:26,310
Our idea about on it is to sell
you all shit that we would use,

8
00:00:26,311 --> 00:00:28,170
whether it's strength and
conditioning equipment,

9
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:32,970
whether it's supplements like the, the
best hemp protein powder we could find,

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,440
or whether it's raw foods like
walnut, almond, cashew butter,

11
00:00:37,441 --> 00:00:42,441
or we have hemp force bars and we have
what we even sell this buffalo bar.

12
00:00:44,131 --> 00:00:47,760
That's pretty bad as it's made the same
way the native Americans used to make it.

13
00:00:47,761 --> 00:00:51,780
It's buffalo beat with buffalo
meat with cranberries and pepper.

14
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:53,550
It's delicious.
It's good for you.

15
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:56,190
It's better than a lot of shit you shoved
down your face when you're hungry for

16
00:00:56,191 --> 00:00:57,024
snacks.

17
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,570
We sell strength and
conditioning equipment like
kettle bells and battle ropes

18
00:01:00,571 --> 00:01:03,990
and we have the new,
a Zombie bells and primal bells.

19
00:01:03,991 --> 00:01:07,740
Which of my personal favorite because
if you're going to work out and you want

20
00:01:07,741 --> 00:01:12,720
motivation to, the two best motivations
are end of the world apocalypse scenario,

21
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:14,520
which the Zombie kettle bells represent.

22
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:17,220
Or you're about to get your
dick bit off by a chimpanzee.

23
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:21,600
That's what the Primal Bells, Remy
Warren knows the fuck I'm talking about.

24
00:01:21,601 --> 00:01:25,770
He's camped in Africa. Ladies
and gentlemen, this is not
just a fucking visitor.

25
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:30,810
All right. That's uh, I was checking out
that a gorilla bell on their end. It's it.

26
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:33,990
You want one? I'll have it
sent to you. The thing is,

27
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:36,660
I don't even know if I'm strong
enough right now to lift that one,

28
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:40,490
but it's gonna motivate me to just,
I just want to crank. I will vote.

29
00:01:40,491 --> 00:01:43,560
It's like he's just got that
furrowed brow. The grill.

30
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:47,250
It doesn't have to just be angry.
He's just bad ass, you know? Yeah.

31
00:01:47,251 --> 00:01:49,950
The chimp has to show his teeth and
he'd pull it, pull up the image.

32
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:54,450
It's not working. Something's
wrong. Um, the, uh,

33
00:01:54,451 --> 00:01:59,430
the chimpanzee looks all angry, but the
grill was like, Bitch, oh, goody. Oh Wow.

34
00:01:59,431 --> 00:02:01,290
Look at that girl.
Doesn't need to show no teeth.

35
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:05,040
All those are a completely
three d balanced as well.

36
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:08,400
We made sure that when we made these,
these are not just ornaments,

37
00:02:08,401 --> 00:02:09,480
they're beautiful to look at,

38
00:02:09,481 --> 00:02:13,950
but there are a hundred percent functional
as far as a kettle bells as far as

39
00:02:13,951 --> 00:02:15,570
like the balance of it,
the weight,

40
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:18,810
you have to shift it so that you know
you don't want the face slamming in your

41
00:02:18,811 --> 00:02:21,480
forum. You want the round part
in the back, but other than that,

42
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:26,400
easy to use and they will last fucking
forever. Those bitches are solid metal.

43
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,940
They will last forever and if you're
going to get into kettlebell workouts,

44
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:33,270
I suggest very strongly
that if you can afford it,

45
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:36,630
go to someone who knows what they're
doing and take a private lesson.

46
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:37,411
Go to like any,

47
00:02:37,411 --> 00:02:40,560
there's a lot of gyms that show
that have a kettlebell instructors,

48
00:02:40,561 --> 00:02:42,480
they do crossfit and
things along those lines.

49
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:46,620
They'll be able to show you just the
basic movements and hopefully they'll let

50
00:02:46,621 --> 00:02:49,710
you film it with your phone or
something like that or not. If not,

51
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:53,340
if you can't afford that, go to youtube.
There's many, many instructional videos,

52
00:02:53,341 --> 00:02:57,900
but do it correctly. Do it slowly.
Pay attention to your form.

53
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,640
Do lightweights at first,
very important.

54
00:03:00,641 --> 00:03:04,840
You'd be amazed at what a good workout
you can get from a 35 pound kettle bell,

55
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:08,260
the extreme kettlebell cardio
workout DVD that we sell on the site.

56
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:13,210
I use that with one 35 pound kettle
bell and it's a motherfucker you,

57
00:03:13,211 --> 00:03:14,530
you will enjoy the shit out of.

58
00:03:14,531 --> 00:03:18,130
It incorporates a lot of body weight
exercises as well along with that 35 pound

59
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:22,240
kettle bell and it is a fucking
hard exploder go to on it.

60
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:26,950
Oh and it used the code name Brogan and
save 10% off any and all supplements.

61
00:03:26,951 --> 00:03:29,620
We also have a new program. Uh,

62
00:03:29,621 --> 00:03:31,010

We've,

63
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:35,410
we can get all the supplements that
you enjoy and use shipped to you

64
00:03:35,411 --> 00:03:39,760
automatically each month at the lowest
price. Guaranteed. That's o. N N.

65
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:43,150
I t again,
use the codeword Rogan and save 10% off.

66
00:03:43,151 --> 00:03:46,570
Any of the supplements were
also brought to you by Lumosity.

67
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:50,380
Lumosity is a website that essentially
it's like a gym for your brain.

68
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:51,820
That's how it's set up.

69
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:56,620
It's set up to give you things to do that
are exciting and that can enhance and

70
00:03:56,621 --> 00:04:01,390
work on various aspects of cognitive
function. Like your memory.

71
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,310
There's all these different settings.

72
00:04:03,311 --> 00:04:07,570
If you go to lumosity.com you can check
it out. It's really interesting. Um,

73
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:11,200
I like it cause they're like games and uh,
when you go there,

74
00:04:11,201 --> 00:04:12,880
like you click the get started now button,

75
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:16,990
it immediately takes you this
thing that asks you about memory.

76
00:04:16,991 --> 00:04:19,240
Select all aspects of your
member that you want to train.

77
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:22,270
Things like recalling
the location of objects,

78
00:04:22,271 --> 00:04:25,050
remembering the names after
the first introduction, uh,

79
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:29,220
learning new subjects and then
you'll move from that onto attention.

80
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:33,640
Then moved from that on to speed and
they'll build you a personalized training

81
00:04:33,641 --> 00:04:38,110
program. I think that's pretty
cool. Um, it's also, it's fun.

82
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:41,410
It's like it's an easy thing to do.
That's fun. That's good for your brain.

83
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:42,251
It's healthy.

84
00:04:42,251 --> 00:04:46,270
Just like your body needs to exercise
in order to work at maximum efficiency.

85
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:49,960
He brain needs to too. They have
them set up. Uh, so there's a,

Workout your brain and make Lumosity
a part of your everyday routine.

89
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:03,460

We're also brought to you
by squarespace.com and
if you listen to our last

96
00:05:22,361 --> 00:05:27,140
podcast, you realize that Squarespace
is hosting a, a contest. Now. Uh,

97
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,650
it goes on. I think this
is the last week, right?

98
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,860
It doesn't like January
17th. I think it ends. Um,

99
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:37,960
spear Squarespace is the
easiest way to make a website.

100
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:41,800
Excuse me.
If you thought about hiring somebody,

101
00:05:41,801 --> 00:05:45,940
like hiring a website company to design
your website, that shit is expensive.

102
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:49,360
It takes a long time.
Sometimes it's annoying.

103
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:52,720
You can do it yourself.
It used to be that it was a fun,

104
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,010
I mean you could always do it yourself.

105
00:05:54,011 --> 00:05:57,590
If you wanted to learn html or you wanted
to learn how to use Dreamweaver or all

106
00:05:57,591 --> 00:06:00,860
these different various
website creating softwares,

107
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:03,620
but you don't have to do that anymore.
It's so simple.

108
00:06:03,621 --> 00:06:06,950
A dummy like me can make a website,
a sweet website,

109
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:08,690
but just point and click.

110
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:13,720
Drag and drop is easy as using the
normal functions on your computer and you

111
00:06:14,691 --> 00:06:17,480
could set up a website that
you could sell things from.

112
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:19,820
You could easily set up ecommerce there.

113
00:06:19,821 --> 00:06:23,600
They have it set up so that you can
sell things there. You can down,

114
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:26,900
you could have music downloads,
you could sell music if you're a musician.

115
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:32,170
It's a really easy and sweet way to
set up in an all in one platform,

116
00:06:33,081 --> 00:06:37,700
your own website. It makes the
work on I iPhones, android,

117
00:06:37,701 --> 00:06:40,100

You're Fox. Keep the music. Dan
Dodi's here. Remy warrants here.

133
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:44,563
Let's get busy.

134
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,800
The Joe Rogan experience by day
Joe Rogan podcast by night all day

135
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:01,730
because of two.
These two men that are here today,

136
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:04,630
one of them is responsible for
turning me into a hunting nut.

137
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:06,520
Dan Dodi was a big part of that.

138
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:09,910
The experience of going to
Montana and a Ramey warrant.

139
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:12,970
If you've ever watched
any of the shows a on the,

140
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:16,450
is it the sportsmans channel yet? Well,
the meat eaters on the sportsman's,

141
00:08:16,451 --> 00:08:20,410
I've done some stuff with Steve and then
a solo hundred is on outdoor checks.

142
00:08:20,411 --> 00:08:23,160
On the outdoor channel. Yeah.
There's three channels on, uh,

143
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:26,950
on direct TV that are pretty much all
hunting and fishing. What's the third one?

144
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:32,200
I don't know. It's like your suit
and it's so every time I tuned in,

145
00:08:32,201 --> 00:08:35,440
if I'm looking for like my a dressing
room this weekend I was in Phoenix doing

146
00:08:35,441 --> 00:08:38,290
stand up and we just had hunting shows
on it. Dressing room all the time.

147
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:41,560
I'm fucking bananas. I'm not really
doing, you've got a real frog.

148
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:45,550
Watch them all the time.
Oh Dude, I'm sick. And you
don't really care what it is.

149
00:08:45,551 --> 00:08:49,090
You Watch, whatever. Um, they're
terrible. A lot of them are awful.

150
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:51,790
I was telling you guys before that there
was one that was watching where a kid

151
00:08:51,791 --> 00:08:55,740
was getting interviewed and he had his
hand up to block the sun as the cameras

152
00:08:55,741 --> 00:08:57,780
interviewing him. And
he's like, well, you know,

153
00:08:57,781 --> 00:09:01,220
we're going to go out today and
hopefully we'll be successful. And like,

154
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:02,490
what do you know?
There's a lot.

155
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:05,100
There's a fucking Sun's
glaring in this kid's face.

156
00:09:05,101 --> 00:09:07,560
Can you move the camera
can moved the couch?

157
00:09:07,561 --> 00:09:08,910
Like what the fuck are you guys doing?

158
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:13,250
And it's one of the things that I really
did appreciate about your show, um,

159
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:16,890
meat eater that you produce is
that it's just so much better shot.

160
00:09:16,891 --> 00:09:21,270
It's so much more interesting. The
narration is, is, uh, it's articulate.

161
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:25,080
It's fascinating. It's introspective,
you know, it's the, it's a full picture.

162
00:09:25,081 --> 00:09:28,110
It's a great show. And I was trying
to show this to my wife the other day.

163
00:09:28,111 --> 00:09:28,381
I'm like,

164
00:09:28,381 --> 00:09:32,640
this fucking show is too good to just
be tucked away on a hunting channel

165
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:33,411
because the,

166
00:09:33,411 --> 00:09:36,660
the hunting channel programs for the most
part don't attract the regular folks.

167
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:40,590
But I really think that show was so
well made that it could be on the travel

168
00:09:40,591 --> 00:09:45,330
channel or you know,
discovery. It's a great show.

169
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:48,210
She thinks I'm fucking crazy.
She doesn't want to talk to me.

170
00:09:48,211 --> 00:09:51,900
He says what I said in front of the
couch watching animals die. You know,

171
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:56,370
especially like yesterday was a rough
one because I was watching the lion hunt

172
00:09:56,371 --> 00:09:57,300
that I was telling you about.

173
00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:00,720
Pig Man was a shooting lions with a
bow and Arrow and these lines and just

174
00:10:00,721 --> 00:10:03,660
laying there sleeping and he's creeping
up on him and pumps an hour to their

175
00:10:03,661 --> 00:10:06,450
heart and she's like, I
gotta go. I can't watch this.

176
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:10,670
Yes. So just shows like that.
You know, the normal guy gone,

177
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:11,900
oh I'm going to check this out.

178
00:10:11,901 --> 00:10:13,190
And then they turn on one
of those shows are like,

179
00:10:13,191 --> 00:10:17,310
what the hell is going on here? You know?
But then comes along guy like Dan Dodi,

180
00:10:17,311 --> 00:10:21,350
we just make some awesome stuff that can
be anywhere and you know what I mean?

181
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:25,160
You can find these really good shows on
there as well that are full of adventure

182
00:10:25,161 --> 00:10:28,450
and just being out there being a man,
you know, it's no way I can sit here.

183
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:32,360
I can't take credit for that shit.
There's no, there's no credit for it,

184
00:10:32,361 --> 00:10:33,194
but you are a part of it.

185
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:37,110
Sure, sure. Yeah. Yeah. But
there's a huge like very crew,

186
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:40,740
very creative, very like
fantastic team. That makes sense.

187
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:42,730
Yes.
That's a very important thing.

188
00:10:42,731 --> 00:10:45,250
And it's the you that's shows how humble
you are, that you brought that up,

189
00:10:45,251 --> 00:10:47,980
that that is a very important aspect
of anything that comes out. Well,

190
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:51,250
there's a team behind it and
especially a big time TV show.

191
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:53,470
Here's a fucking team of
people behind the scenes

192
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:57,990
and, and we give a shit.
And Steve, you know, has an
incredibly intelligent way to,

193
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:00,380
to do what he does and to
talk about what he does.

194
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:05,360
And we have people who can edit and shoot
and run the show. And it's just, it's,

195
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:08,030
it's a big deal. And,
and having, uh, you know,

196
00:11:08,031 --> 00:11:10,960
bringing grammy out there who has
been a perfect fit for us too. It's,

197
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:15,410
I think I can't watch hunting TV. I can
barely watch our show. I love our show.

198
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:17,810
I can barely watch our show,
but I really,

199
00:11:17,811 --> 00:11:21,110
I could not sit like you
and watch haunting TV in
general. I just can't do it.

200
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:23,870
I watch it all the time,
but I'm obsessed right now with hunting.

201
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:25,530
Hopefully it'll calm down a little bit.

202
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:29,910
No, I'm obsessed. I was
like born into it and I'm,

203
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:33,570
I'm more obsessed now than I was when I
first got into it. How old do you know?

204
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:37,320
I'm 28 now. And you've been hunting
your entire life? Yeah, I mean,

205
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:40,980
I don't remember a time where it
wasn't hunting. You know, I think like,

206
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:44,100
I remember a birthday party when
I was a kid, you know, and uh,

207
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:48,160
had to be like first grade
and my, you know, got a,

208
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,820
some kind of pellet gun or whatever,
you know,

209
00:11:50,821 --> 00:11:53,800
we set up this little thing
in the backyard, just all
these balloons and targets.

210
00:11:53,801 --> 00:11:54,070
And I was

211
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:57,490
a kid when I was in first grade. Man, I
just sit there, pow, POW, POW, POW, pow,

212
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:58,211
all day long.

213
00:11:58,211 --> 00:12:03,211
Just just shooting and stocking
things and just where did you grow up?

214
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:08,110
I grew up in Reno, Nevada. Oh
Wow. Yeah. Got To have a gun.
If you live in Reno. Yeah.

215
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:12,400
People. Yeah. Just for the people you have
to hunt. Exactly. I mean, Johnny Cash,

216
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:15,420
he shot a guy in Reno, right?
That's right. Just to watch him die.

217
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:19,720
I mean it shows you
what kind of an effect that fucking town.

218
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:25,150
Yeah. I first found out about you
because of meat eater. Um, the uh,

219
00:12:25,151 --> 00:12:28,000
episode where you guys a while
there was a couple of them.

220
00:12:28,001 --> 00:12:30,960
You went on one of them when you
went to New Zealand, right? Yeah.

221
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:31,961
And then there was another,

222
00:12:31,961 --> 00:12:36,670
was that the one where you had to travel
that crazy fucking river that we shut

223
00:12:36,671 --> 00:12:40,300
that Steve shot that shammy across the
river in the hand across it. And I was,

224
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,290
I was pretty Wally man.
That was bad ass moments on our show.

225
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,760
And that wasn't a bullshit fake.

226
00:12:48,761 --> 00:12:53,740
Dow was nothing was that
iceberg was coming down to
and we have that line across

227
00:12:53,741 --> 00:12:55,390
there and we're all looking
at each other like, yeah,

228
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:57,160
we may film someone die here today.

229
00:12:57,190 --> 00:13:01,570
This is part of my duties to is I'm kind
of like the medical guy or officer on

230
00:13:01,571 --> 00:13:02,404
the,
on the crew too.

231
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:06,460
I was scared shitless that day and
Steve doesn't have a whole lot of fear.

232
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:09,400
Ramey doesn't have much
fear in that's fine.

233
00:13:09,401 --> 00:13:12,370
But to manage that shit in the field,
that was sketchy man. That was like,

234
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:13,990
but then the,
the product of that,

235
00:13:13,991 --> 00:13:17,380
that sequence of that
actual action in the moment,

236
00:13:17,381 --> 00:13:18,820
to me that's the most exciting,

237
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:21,760
well it's so exciting and they
didn't play it up with them.

238
00:13:21,761 --> 00:13:25,090
Some stupid cliffhanger at the
like, you know, like oh Jesus,

239
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,030
like pretending slips a little
bit. Yeah. There was none of that.

240
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:32,680
It was just the drama of the real
situation of trying to cross a freezing

241
00:13:32,681 --> 00:13:37,090
glacial river was more than enough.
It was amazing. It was fucking scary.

242
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:41,360
That's an amazing day. Right? I mean,
you know, like before, I mean we,

243
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:43,250
we kind of had to think about this,
you know,

244
00:13:43,251 --> 00:13:46,600
and I stuck my hand in there and we
timed how long before your joints stop

245
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:51,340
moving, you know, and it was like 60
seconds and that water, you're done.

246
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:56,140
You are gone. Ice Water. Literally I just,
just warming up to not the ice anymore.

247
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:01,510
God Damn. And then the next day we get
up and climbed, climbed up a, you know,

248
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:05,540
3000 feet up mountain almost slipped
off a cliff for the integrity of it.

249
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:09,520
Your show. The fact that I know when
I watched that, that all this is real.

250
00:14:09,521 --> 00:14:13,180
When we did that thing in Montana and when
we win a mule deer hunting, there was,

251
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:17,260
there was no bullshit. There was no faking
anything. There's no fake scenarios.

252
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:20,830
There's a show that I really love.
It's a Alaska, the last frontier,

253
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:24,760
but I watched it the other
day and they, uh, they're,

254
00:14:24,761 --> 00:14:27,430
they're fly fishing and in
the middle of fishing, uh,

255
00:14:27,431 --> 00:14:31,150
all of a sudden a bear shows up and the
bears eating some salmon and they're

256
00:14:31,151 --> 00:14:33,400
like, Oh shit, a bears here.
We've gotta get Outta here.

257
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:35,100
And then I look at the salmon and the fuck

258
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:36,700
Hammond's been filleted.

259
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:42,460
They've taken the filets off the salmon
and through the carcasses out for the

260
00:14:42,461 --> 00:14:46,450
bear, they baited this fucking bear
to come up to the river. And I'm like,

261
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:49,180
God damn it. You ran out of
shit. That's interesting. Yeah.

262
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:51,980
I can't think at first they were
just all homesteading and shit,

263
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:54,380
but then now they got to fake some,
some,

264
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:58,340
some Hollywood producer Dick wads
can get ahold of it and try to fake

265
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:01,830
thanks Vic. They underestimate
the intelligence of the
average American viewer,

266
00:15:01,831 --> 00:15:02,270
man.
They,

267
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:06,210
it's like almost insulting to watch them
this stuff and say it's some guy that's

268
00:15:06,211 --> 00:15:07,620
never seen a salmon in his life,

269
00:15:07,621 --> 00:15:11,250
thinks is a good idea to do that and
they think that nobody's going to know.

270
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:16,320
Yeah. Okay. It's me clean
filet on both sides.

271
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:21,090
I mean just like so obvious at this
thing came out of a cooler and somewhat

272
00:15:21,091 --> 00:15:23,430
chucked it and Q big foot.
Yeah.

273
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:27,930
I think they underestimate part of
America's intelligence and then they

274
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:31,800
perfectly nail a lot of hunger, America's
intelligence because people eat it up.

275
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:36,120
You guys were, the first time I found
out about duck dynasty were on that trip.

276
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:37,170
You were goofing on it.

277
00:15:37,171 --> 00:15:40,500
You and Steve were going back and forth
goofing on duck dive and see like you

278
00:15:40,501 --> 00:15:44,340
done lost your redneck.
I lost my red neck and I was like,

279
00:15:44,341 --> 00:15:46,290
what is this fucking show?
And you're like,

280
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:50,700
this is unbelievably stupid show that's
so obviously fake about these guys that

281
00:15:50,701 --> 00:15:53,460
have done, which then became
the biggest show on TV. Dude,

282
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:57,360
it crushed our show are my Scifi
show that I was doing for awhile.

283
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:58,890
When I first started doing it,

284
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:02,580
the ratings were excellent and then we
went up against duck dynasty and got

285
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:05,280
stopped.
Everybody,

286
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:10,260
it was like the highest rated premier
ever in cable TV history for a show like

287
00:16:10,261 --> 00:16:13,470
that. My Dad, my dad, just fucking love.

288
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:17,570
Especially now that the god done came
out and stood up for heterosexual.

289
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:22,080
You know what a man can
have his own opinion. Yeah.

290
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:24,420
I think a man's ass as a shitty choices.

291
00:16:24,421 --> 00:16:28,470
Well everybody gets all fucking
crazy and riled up. Goddamn,

292
00:16:28,471 --> 00:16:32,790
you taken away their first amendment
rights. How did that resolve?

293
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:37,290
They just fucking, they backed off.
I mean I think it's a and e right?

294
00:16:37,291 --> 00:16:40,860
Cause that what? It was just hilarious.
Right? And they used to be like old plays,

295
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:43,200
these masterpiece theater and Shit,
you know?

296
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:47,460
And now it's this fucking fake show about
these guys who just grew their beard

297
00:16:47,461 --> 00:16:51,330
out only for this show. Have you ever
see those photos of them? No. Oh,

298
00:16:51,331 --> 00:16:55,620
it came out since the show that they
didn't use to look like that at all.

299
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:59,340
They would normal guys, like they
had like a regular, you know,

300
00:16:59,341 --> 00:17:02,130
facial hair grew it all out for the show.

301
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:06,300
So they started on a hunting channel.
They started with duck commander. Right.

302
00:17:06,330 --> 00:17:08,790
I think. Right. So like
when I was a kid, man,

303
00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:13,680
duck commander videos were the
shit. I mean, it was like, you know,

304
00:17:13,681 --> 00:17:14,251
Phil Roberts,

305
00:17:14,251 --> 00:17:17,700
you'd be out there and his duck blind
and he would say some funny stuff.

306
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:18,210
And I'm like,

307
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:22,140
I literally learned how to call ducks
from duck commander videos like as a kid,

308
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:24,480
you know, so like you see like, you know,

309
00:17:24,481 --> 00:17:26,310
and I don't know how many other
people have had that experience,

310
00:17:26,311 --> 00:17:29,760
but nobody ever taught me how to duck
hunt, you know? And so I was like, I was,

311
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:32,550
I was like any kind of hunting I could do,
I wanted to do.

312
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:35,540
So I would teach myself whatever
I would get books. Oh yeah, yeah.

313
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,910
This is what they looked like. And
this is all those guys. No Shit. Yes,

314
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:43,070
that's them. Why do we have
one with a duck fly through?

315
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:48,600
Look at, it's crazy. They're
like golfers, they like suburban,

316
00:17:48,601 --> 00:17:50,070
like gated

317
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:54,660
community golfers. I Dunno, I don't know
that much about, I don't know either.

318
00:17:54,661 --> 00:17:59,160
But I mean, who cares? I mean like
they're just selling duck blinds.

319
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:03,880
And my point was that, um, you guys
don't do any fake shit, you know, and,

320
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:08,700
and, and, and not doing fake shit. It's
still a really fucking exciting show.

321
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:12,330
Steve sent me the one from this upcoming
season where it gets charged by the

322
00:18:12,331 --> 00:18:15,730
Moose. Did you see that? Fuck yeah,
I did. I saw it five times. No,

323
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:20,670
isn't it that fucking moment, man. That's
crazy. That's awesome. He got fucking,

324
00:18:20,671 --> 00:18:23,040
he took a brisket shot and when
I say anything I, you know,

325
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:24,380
I don't want to give it away because a,

326
00:18:24,381 --> 00:18:26,370
I don't want to spoil the drama
when it comes on television.

327
00:18:26,371 --> 00:18:29,490
What I've said has not spoiled
at all though. Holy Shit.

328
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:32,370
It's a great fucking show.
It's not just a hunting show.

329
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:35,040
It's a great show and that's what I was
trying to convince my wife. I'm like,

330
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:37,650
this is a good fucking show.
She's like, okay, crazy.

331
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:43,110
Whatever most people do once they do
see it though, that they'll get it,

332
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,530
they'll get it. They'll understand
that it's not, I mean there's,

333
00:18:46,531 --> 00:18:51,310
there's so much explicit sort of
conversation about what we're doing. It's,

334
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:54,660
it makes sense. It's clear. When we were
in Wisconsin freeze and our dicks off,

335
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:57,510
we were in that, that deer
blind. It was cold as fuck.

336
00:18:57,511 --> 00:19:01,770
And Dan Dodi steps outside of the blind
and he's taking all these crazy shots.

337
00:19:01,771 --> 00:19:05,040
And I was thinking, man,
you fucking work hard dude.

338
00:19:05,041 --> 00:19:09,780
You guys work hard everywhere you and
moe and everyone in that showed that is a

339
00:19:09,781 --> 00:19:12,620
fucking 24 hour day job
too because there's,

340
00:19:12,621 --> 00:19:16,320
you don't get off at nine o'clock in
the night, you know, boy, long day.

341
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:18,930
But at least I go back to my
hotel room to fuck you do,

342
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:22,980
you're sleeping on the ground or in the
basement or in the basement at Doug,

343
00:19:22,981 --> 00:19:27,840
her aunt's house. You know, in Wisconsin,
it's cold as fuck up there too. Shit.

344
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:31,040
I think I go pretty hard, you know, and
then these guys come to New Zealand,

345
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:34,070
you've got, oh film crews coming. This
is my first dealing with them, you know,

346
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:36,800
and New Zealand's not for pussies,
man.

347
00:19:36,801 --> 00:19:39,710
It's like the roughest place
on the planet. So they told me,

348
00:19:39,711 --> 00:19:42,530
there's few film crews come
in and I'm like, Oh God.

349
00:19:42,531 --> 00:19:46,190
Well I don't know how this is gonna work
and these dudes are running around the

350
00:19:46,191 --> 00:19:50,210
truck. And I'm like, I thought I went
pretty good. And if I put a gps on them,

351
00:19:50,211 --> 00:19:54,860
they hung like a bird dog out in front of
you, up, back, back in, up the mountain,

352
00:19:54,861 --> 00:19:56,030
down the mountain. You're like, holy.

353
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,000
Well,
when we were in Montana,

354
00:19:58,001 --> 00:20:00,970
we were going through the bad
lands and it's high altitude.

355
00:20:00,971 --> 00:20:03,700
It's really cold and it's
exhausting because it's all mud.

356
00:20:03,701 --> 00:20:06,660
You're walking through the mud.
These guys are running in front of us.

357
00:20:06,661 --> 00:20:08,620
Like I'm exhausted just from hiking.

358
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,710
They're running in front of
us to film us being exhausted,

359
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:16,450
and you guys probably put out an extra
40% more calories in anybody because

360
00:20:16,451 --> 00:20:19,300
you're also carrying this giant ass
fucking camera up this mountain.

361
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,540
Like all I have, the rifle at
least is strapped to my shoulders.

362
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:25,810
I'm moving my arms and shit.
You guys have to carry this fucking thing.

363
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:29,450
I'm proud of my one handed abilities.
I learned, I learned this all from moe,

364
00:20:29,451 --> 00:20:33,530
like he and his ethic and his way is
why the show is what it is and why I

365
00:20:33,531 --> 00:20:35,990
learned I didn't know
how to shoot a camera for
[inaudible]. Who's the director?

366
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,050
I'm the director now.
He was a director. He's,

367
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:43,670
he's not doing a whole lot with media.
You meat eater anymore. But um, yeah,

368
00:20:43,671 --> 00:20:45,860
I didn't, he taught me every
God damn thing. I know.

369
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,130
I didn't know a thing about TV.
About shooting.

370
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:50,830
Yeah. Mo goes to the gym,
it puts a big pack on,

371
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:54,250
filled with shit and gets on a
stair climber to prepare for work.

372
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:56,650
Yeah.

373
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:59,710
Says the best shape he was ever in was
from surfing and then he went out and

374
00:20:59,711 --> 00:21:02,800
kicked Steve's ass in the field.
He was able to run laps around Steve,

375
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:05,680
but it was surfing. Really. I got him
to that shape. That's interesting.

376
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:09,290
I wouldn't feel like surfing would
be that exhaustive. Oh Man. Yeah.

377
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:12,790
I tried to get, I went surfing
one time with my brother and uh,

378
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:15,850
in the Dominican Republic. You know
what I'm thinking? Like, oh yeah,

379
00:21:15,851 --> 00:21:17,500
this can't be that,
that bad.

380
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:22,000
I was so gassed by the time I got out
to catch a wave. I was like, screw this.

381
00:21:22,001 --> 00:21:26,380
I'm going back just from the oven. Yeah,
yeah. No, just trying to paddle out there,

382
00:21:26,381 --> 00:21:30,140
man. If you see that does make sense. I
was just thinking of the surface itself.

383
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:32,500
I didn't take into account
the swimming out to you.

384
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:35,110
You use all those muscles
like every muscle,

385
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:39,130
you know you're trying to stay bowel. This
is live on the way. Yeah. Oh, everything.

386
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:41,880
It's, yeah. Yeah, I would imagine. Well,

387
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:44,950
I was surprised at how fucking
hard the hiking was in Montana.

388
00:21:44,951 --> 00:21:47,570
That was the one thing that really shocked
me because I was in pretty good shape

389
00:21:47,571 --> 00:21:48,404
when I went there too.

390
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:51,580
Luckily because I was thinking like
as we're going up to sale, it's like,

391
00:21:51,581 --> 00:21:53,890
what if I was a fuck head and I did.

392
00:21:53,891 --> 00:21:57,030
It didn't work out all the time or I
drank a lot or something like that.

393
00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:00,640
This is fucking hardcore shit.
You did well calendered while he,

394
00:22:00,641 --> 00:22:04,630
both of you both just showed up. We got
lucky. We got lucky that we were in shape.

395
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:08,260
You know, like that you couldn't do
that if he wasn't, we weren't in shape.

396
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,720
It's fucking hard. Couldn't hunt like
right now and you're like, Steve,

397
00:22:10,721 --> 00:22:13,600
you couldn't hunt. We Hunt. I mean most
people don't hunt that way. As you know,

398
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:16,270
as you've sort of seen that it's not,
not everybody.

399
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:19,050
I've taken a lot of dudes and uh,

400
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:23,860
a lot of them puke the first day
just on that just die, just die.

401
00:22:23,861 --> 00:22:27,430
And well Steve was telling about these
big power lifted guys that he took out,

402
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:30,880
you know, that there were
saying, uh, you know, you guys,
you guys are in good shape.

403
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:31,661
Yeah,
we're in good shape.

404
00:22:31,661 --> 00:22:36,661
He goes 30 minutes in their red in the
face and throwing up and there's like a

405
00:22:37,211 --> 00:22:38,770
huge difference between being,
he'll,

406
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:42,940
he'll fit and fit for other things
because like I've been doing this my whole

407
00:22:42,941 --> 00:22:46,930
life. I do it. She had
about 200 more days a year.

408
00:22:46,931 --> 00:22:51,850
Like a couple of years ago. I was 324
days in the Bush, you know, so it's like,

409
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:54,980
it's nothing, it's just
another day, you know,

410
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:59,770
but you build up this kind
of fitness, you know, for,

411
00:22:59,771 --> 00:23:03,550
for going up hill. I'm good at
going up hill flat. Don't like,

412
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:07,600
it's like muscle memory uphill works every
time. You have to do it all the time.

413
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:10,060
That's the case with everything.
Martial arts,

414
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:12,820
the more you get efficiency of movement,

415
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:15,700
your body understands that movement
can do it over and over again.

416
00:23:15,701 --> 00:23:19,380
Then you have this massive endurance
in it. Exactly. You know like legs is,

417
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:22,630
especially when you think about like
how ridiculous it is that your legs just

418
00:23:22,631 --> 00:23:27,130
carry around all day and not under
normal circumstances. Never get tired.

419
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,640
Your legs, you walk to work, you'd sit
down, you'd walk around the office,

420
00:23:30,641 --> 00:23:34,450
there's no problem. Think about if you
had a carry 120 pounds with your arms,

421
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:37,750
you know it's ridiculous just
carrying it with your arms.

422
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:41,210
Forget about like moving constantly
and shifting weight. You'd do.

423
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:44,650
Your legs can do some pretty amazing
things, which is why kickboxing,

424
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:47,030
it's a great way to fight cause your,

425
00:23:47,031 --> 00:23:49,970
your legs can do shit that your
upper body could just never do.

426
00:23:49,971 --> 00:23:51,590
The amount of force that you can generate.

427
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:54,230
What do you think the ratio is in
force from your leg to your arm?

428
00:23:54,290 --> 00:23:56,650
It's ridiculous. It's
off the charts. Yeah.

429
00:23:57,470 --> 00:24:01,730
Several times 20 maybe if it
spends on what kind of kick,

430
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:03,260
but like a spinning back kick.

431
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,840
If you ever seen someone who
really knows how to kick a bag,

432
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:10,100
kick a bag with like a turning side kick
or spending back in, it goes flying.

433
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:13,070
I have 150 pound bag and it
launches through the air.

434
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:15,860
I can't do that with a punch.
If you kick somebody like that,

435
00:24:15,861 --> 00:24:18,050
it's like hitting them with a car.
They just go flying.

436
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:21,200
You could just do shit with your legs.
You could never do with your arms.

437
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:24,500
Think about it like all your weights in
the foot. That spinning too. When you're,

438
00:24:24,501 --> 00:24:27,620
when you're punching, you know both feet
are planted. You know you're pushing,

439
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:30,630
you're using momentum, but you're
like, when you're spinning around,

440
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:33,620
you throw every bit of weight
into that foot is deadly.

441
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:36,440
It's also the size of your feet so
much bigger than the size of your hand.

442
00:24:36,441 --> 00:24:38,930
The bigger hands are the hardy
you can punch and the big,

443
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:41,900
it's way bigger than your fucking hand.
It's heavier bone.

444
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:44,120
Think about how much you
can hit with your heel.

445
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:46,040
We're never bothers your heel at all.

446
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:49,220
You could run on concrete with your
heel and literally get away with it.

447
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:51,590
You couldn't punch concrete once,
you know,

448
00:24:51,591 --> 00:24:53,770
so the amount of force that
you could generate with your,

449
00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:55,520
your legs and your feet,
it's crazy.

450
00:24:55,521 --> 00:24:58,520
It's just a little more difficult to
do because you're balancing on one leg,

451
00:24:58,521 --> 00:25:02,450
it's a little slower because the bones
are heavier, but God damn when it lands,

452
00:25:02,451 --> 00:25:03,320
it's ridiculous.

453
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:07,730
The amount of head kicks that land in
in the UFC and wound up being knockouts,

454
00:25:07,731 --> 00:25:10,940
it's pretty fucking high.
He kicked somebody in the
head. It's usually not good,

455
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:16,400
but the price, it was just
still so very surprising to me.

456
00:25:16,401 --> 00:25:18,950
The endurance that you
need to just walk up hills,

457
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:22,480
you need some serious and endurance.
And Dan was telling me that you,

458
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:26,560
you did some crazy veal Max
test and wound up like, uh,

459
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:29,280
like an elite endurance athletes.
Yeah. So we did this, uh,

460
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:32,270
for actually this new show that, uh,
we'll probably end up talking about here.

461
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:37,430
We did this vo two Max test, which for
people that don't know what that is,

462
00:25:37,431 --> 00:25:40,610
it measures your endurance capability.
So it's a,

463
00:25:40,611 --> 00:25:44,060
it's essentially where at what
point your body goes anaerobic,

464
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:47,660
how much oxygen you take in
and then carbon dioxide out.

465
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:51,770
And then what happens is your body,
your muscles work on oxygen.

466
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:56,270
So once that your, your muscles
can't take in any more oxygen,

467
00:25:56,300 --> 00:26:00,380
your body goes anaerobic, your endurance
is over, you know, you get gas,

468
00:26:00,381 --> 00:26:05,210
do you get hit? You're done. So we,
uh, we did this vo two Max test,

469
00:26:05,211 --> 00:26:09,530
right? And, uh, essentially
coming back, I mean the average,

470
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:14,000
what's an average guy like 60? No,
not even I think like 40, 40. Yeah.

471
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:17,720
So like an average guy, he's about 45. Um,

472
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:22,840
I had a vo two Max test at
4,500 feet elevation of 83.6.

473
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:28,640
So, and, and comparing that
maybe television, that might
have been like around 86,

474
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:32,420
87. Um, but so like got
people listening. Well, 86,

475
00:26:32,421 --> 00:26:37,421
87 was that so a Lance Armstrong when he
was blood doping had a vo two Max test

476
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,620
done and it was around,
what was it, 84 84?

477
00:26:42,621 --> 00:26:44,090
I think so.

478
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,230
I mean, think about it.
Like Lance Armstrong,

479
00:26:46,231 --> 00:26:50,220
we know him as he's done some
serious endurance shit, you know,

480
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:54,850
and here's a guy myself,
this just out there every day hiking up.

481
00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:57,240
I mean I'm,
I'm hiking up monster mountains.

482
00:26:57,241 --> 00:27:01,020
I've got a 40 pound pack on,
on average.

483
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:04,260
And then when I'm packing stuff out,
it might be my bodyweight, you know,

484
00:27:04,261 --> 00:27:08,760
through these mountains. But I'm body
weight on top of that. Uh, yeah, like,

485
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:13,310
like, uh, you know, I say I
maxed my pack out about 150,

486
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:17,310
hundred 70 pounds and I weigh about 100
and 5,070 pounds somewhere in there,

487
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:22,620
you know, so I mean, you're
really carrying a lot of
weight going up hill mostly,

488
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:27,570
you know, up and down obviously. And uh,
just doing it every day, day in, day out.

489
00:27:27,571 --> 00:27:32,571
It's like there's no better type of
endurance training you think about it.

490
00:27:32,821 --> 00:27:36,540
I mean, I mean, I normally do
about 20 miles a day and, uh,

491
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:40,140
a lot of elevation gain. I did
just one year, it wasn't my,

492
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:44,500
my biggest year is just more of
an average year. I tracked my, um,

493
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:50,480
elevation gain and within one season I
would have done enough vertical up to

494
00:27:50,941 --> 00:27:55,020
climb Everest 16 times.
That's not that,

495
00:27:55,170 --> 00:28:00,060
that's not the miles, that's just
straight elevation gain. That's, you know,

496
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:05,320
I mean thousands of miles every year.
You know, I think my largest year,

497
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:09,780
I've estimated that it probably be like
summiting Everest 60 times something

498
00:28:09,781 --> 00:28:13,200
like that. Times. Yeah. It's
just so much. I mean, you know,

499
00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:18,210
you go do 3000 feet a day and you're
doing it for 300 days and you just starts

500
00:28:18,721 --> 00:28:21,390
adding up. You know, you just
see that chart. Did you see that?

501
00:28:21,391 --> 00:28:25,770
The excellent category for 18 to 26
year old males was 60 in the highest.

502
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:30,220
Pulled that up. So this meaty something
we're talking fucking free. It's crazy.

503
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:35,160
Like free, not just high, but the dudes
that administered, I mean this was like,

504
00:28:35,161 --> 00:28:38,040
people might come and look, oh, was
it a real, no, this was a legit test.

505
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:41,790
These guys do, you know,
professional athletes, everything.

506
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:44,910
And the guy that had done it, rob, I
mean, he looked at me and he's like,

507
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:49,050
I've been doing this for 24 years. Highest
I've ever seen was a 74. He's like,

508
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:53,460
this is nuts, you know? And
he kind of like, he's like,
oh, you're a hunter, you know?

509
00:28:53,461 --> 00:28:56,100
And it kind of came in there.
I just kind of like, you know,

510
00:28:56,101 --> 00:28:59,520
came in there and low ball them. I was
like, do you, do you work out much?

511
00:28:59,521 --> 00:29:03,450
I was like, no, I mean at work, you
know, you don't really work out. Nah.

512
00:29:03,451 --> 00:29:06,900
You know what I mean? Climb
up hills was shut on your
face. Yeah. I mean when, when,

513
00:29:06,901 --> 00:29:09,360
uh, when it's like my off
what I call my off season,

514
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:13,050
it's any day that I'm not out
out in the woods, um, you know,

515
00:29:13,051 --> 00:29:16,990
I'll do workouts because otherwise I
just get lazy, lethargic, you know,

516
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:21,210
placed and like, what do you do for a
workout if you're, if you're not on, oh,

517
00:29:21,211 --> 00:29:23,930
I mean, it could be. I like to
run. I mean, I don't like to run,

518
00:29:23,931 --> 00:29:26,070
I don't think anyone likes to run.
If they tell you that they're lying.

519
00:29:26,071 --> 00:29:31,050
But I think they like me. I
mean I like, I like to run,

520
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:34,230
I guess you know, for as
much as you like running. Um,

521
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:38,460
I'll do just like body weight stuff.
Yeah. Pull up sips. Cause the thing,

522
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:42,130
the thing that I've learned
for me is I'm just, my body

523
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:46,990
type is endurance. That's it. I'm built
for endurance. So for me to go do sit ups,

524
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:50,230
I'll be there all day. Like
it doesn't do shit, you know,

525
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:55,470
it's just so I would have to, I would
have to change my, cause I went to, um,

526
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:59,800
my buddy Joe did well, he does like
physical fitness training, nutrition,

527
00:29:59,801 --> 00:30:03,460
everything. I was like, man, I want to
get big. And so he's like, all right,

528
00:30:03,490 --> 00:30:06,100
let's do some stuff. And he's
like, dude, for you to get big,

529
00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:07,930
you're going to have to
change your complete.

530
00:30:07,931 --> 00:30:11,680
Like we have to completely change your
muscles from these endurance muscles to

531
00:30:11,681 --> 00:30:13,960
muscles that are just like power.
Yeah.

532
00:30:13,961 --> 00:30:16,750
But you're so young and in
such good shape. I don't
think it would be that hard.

533
00:30:17,130 --> 00:30:20,440
The real issue with it is you run the
risk of being injured because if you want

534
00:30:20,441 --> 00:30:20,921
to get big,

535
00:30:20,921 --> 00:30:24,400
you have to do power lifting stuff like
you have to do dead lifts and squats.

536
00:30:24,401 --> 00:30:28,420
And the only way to really get big is you
got to start doing like sets of three.

537
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:31,760
Yeah, three reps Max. And you
know, when you get to that third,

538
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:34,860
ah,

539
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:37,080
when you do that, man, you're, there's,

540
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:40,200
everything's getting stressed to its
limit and so your body starts freaking out

541
00:30:40,201 --> 00:30:44,760
and goes, we gotta fucking get bigger.
And then if you're shoveling protein down,

542
00:30:44,761 --> 00:30:49,530
you're facing, by the way, farting up a
fucking horrendous storm during the day.

543
00:30:49,650 --> 00:30:52,230
Why? Because you're, you're going
to take in too much protein.

544
00:30:52,231 --> 00:30:54,120
Your body sound not going to
know what to do with a lot of it.

545
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:58,050
If you want to really do it right,
you almost have to overload your system.

546
00:30:58,310 --> 00:31:00,240
You can,
I mean there's,

547
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:03,630
there's a lot of different schools of
thought when it comes to getting big,

548
00:31:03,631 --> 00:31:07,200
but almost universally they agree that
you need a high level of protein in your

549
00:31:07,201 --> 00:31:09,270
body. And if you're eating like, you know,

550
00:31:09,271 --> 00:31:11,310
you're drinking like whey
protein and all that,

551
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:15,600
you just get out far all the time.
My friend Tate,

552
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:17,970
when Tate was, uh, when he was really big,

553
00:31:17,971 --> 00:31:19,380
when he's competing on
the ultimate fighter,

554
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:23,340
it was just constantly pounding
protein bars and him and he would fart.

555
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:27,540
It was so bad that like people
would run out of a room.

556
00:31:28,290 --> 00:31:31,080
I mean, I'm not kidding.
They wouldn't run away.

557
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:35,490
He farted once in the lobby of the comedy
store in La Jolla and people started

558
00:31:35,491 --> 00:31:39,510
screaming. He was screaming like, my God,

559
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:41,130
what the fuck is that?

560
00:31:41,610 --> 00:31:46,610
It's just impacted bowels filled with
undigested protein meeting digestive

561
00:31:47,281 --> 00:31:50,310
enzymes and acids. Yes. No Fun. No,

562
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,260
just open the gates of hell.
Yeah.

563
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:58,580
I'm just going to stick to the hiking,
I think. Yeah. For you to get bigger,

564
00:31:58,581 --> 00:32:02,120
you'd have to do some serious, uh, like
you'd have to lift some serious weights,

565
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:06,050
especially if you can carry a pack that,
that much that heavy all the time.

566
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:07,820
You would have to go heavy.

567
00:32:07,821 --> 00:32:11,840
You would have to be doing like 315
pound squats and things like that.

568
00:32:11,841 --> 00:32:16,060
Then you'd be working with an Arrow.
Oh yeah. That all bulky. UDB Yup. Yeah.

569
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:20,170
It's like uh, you know, it's, it's
all weight to leg ratio in my opinion.

570
00:32:20,171 --> 00:32:25,171
It's like my legs can carry a lot of
weight but my body's like my upper body

571
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:29,210
real light, you know, so I, I trade in
that wait and throw something in my pack.

572
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:32,930
But if your legs are that strong a
guarantee, your arms would adapt.

573
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:36,410
If you force your arms to do things at
a lot of chin ups or things along those

574
00:32:36,411 --> 00:32:39,980
lines, I bet you'd fucking be able to
bang off 20 of them. Cause if you're in

575
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:42,260
that kind of shape,
dude that's a huge advantage.

576
00:32:42,261 --> 00:32:44,480
If you ever wanted to
do Jujitsu. Yeah. Okay.

577
00:32:44,481 --> 00:32:46,310
I wanted to learn a martial art Jiu Jitsu.

578
00:32:46,311 --> 00:32:49,670
One of the big things about Jujitsu is
just getting tired cause you know you're

579
00:32:49,671 --> 00:32:53,100
straining against another grown man is
trying to kill you. I know it's, it's,

580
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:54,620
it's exhausting.

581
00:32:54,621 --> 00:32:58,580
And one of the big things that Jujitsu
guys like universally try to figure out

582
00:32:58,581 --> 00:33:01,340
is what's the best kind of
strength and conditioning workout.

583
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:04,700
Like a lot of the guys run dunes.
That's a big one. Sand Dunes.

584
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:08,270
I've been curious about Jujitsu.
I did. Taekwondo is a kid.

585
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:12,650
Grammy did taekwondo for a long time.
Taekwondo for a long time. My roommate,

586
00:33:12,651 --> 00:33:15,620
Jake's like big. And did you just see
now he went into over to Thailand,

587
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:19,130
did some movie tie in. You
know, so I've been like a,

588
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:23,000
I think that's going to be my end too.
I want to do it. You live in Reno? Yeah.

589
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:25,700
Yeah. I'll find your school. I know,
I know. It's gotta be one near there.

590
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:28,380
I just got my uh, nephew into
it. They didn't have you.

591
00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:33,370
Well as you do jet is that practice that
um, well I started out in taekwondo.

592
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:34,490
I used to teach tok windows.

593
00:33:34,491 --> 00:33:38,030
He did was open champion and one in the
Massachusetts state title four years in

594
00:33:38,031 --> 00:33:40,010
a row before I ever became a comedian.

595
00:33:40,011 --> 00:33:43,130
That's why it's do I used
to teach tok window for a
living. Oh Huh. Yeah. And then,

596
00:33:43,131 --> 00:33:44,210
uh,
I didn't get into Jujitsu,

597
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:48,050
so till [inaudible] 96 I found out
about the UFC and then I started in La.

598
00:33:48,290 --> 00:33:52,010
It's a 96 window instructor when
I was a kid was like my, uh,

599
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:56,100
I dunno my gateway into becoming
a real human. I think you really,

600
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:58,220
he was a good guy. Mine as well. Yeah.

601
00:33:58,221 --> 00:34:02,300
It'd be a becoming a man dealing with
typical chits. Samia yeah, martial arts,

602
00:34:02,301 --> 00:34:02,571
you know,

603
00:34:02,571 --> 00:34:05,780
there's a lot of goofiness to martial
arts is a lot of sort of cult stuff.

604
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:08,960
You know, a lot of times it can get
really weird, especially if the,

605
00:34:08,961 --> 00:34:12,220
the instructor winds up being abusive,
you know, there was always this,

606
00:34:12,221 --> 00:34:15,350
this weirdness of this one
guy who was the, you know,

607
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:18,650
the leader that everyone was terrified
of and thought he was just this great

608
00:34:18,651 --> 00:34:22,130
master that could kill anyone on the
planet. Dude, if you knew about my master,

609
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:26,490
if he got in the UFC, it
would be two deadly. You know,
there's always that, but no,

610
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:27,410
that's interesting actually.

611
00:34:27,411 --> 00:34:31,640
So the same guy who was so good for
me ended up marrying one of his young

612
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:36,710
students. How old? How old was she?
I think she was 17 Oh, Jesus Christ.

613
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:40,100
And he was in his deep thirties,
late twenties. That's not Tampa.

614
00:34:40,970 --> 00:34:44,780
What belt was she?
Wicked black belt.

615
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:49,730
We tested for our black belts together.
Jay. Yeah, Jay, you'd be great at Jujitsu.

616
00:34:49,731 --> 00:34:52,160
It just do it if you want to do it.
It's great martial art.

617
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:55,640
It's to me the best martial art because
you can go full blast and you don't have

618
00:34:55,641 --> 00:34:57,680
to worry about brain trauma.
You know,

619
00:34:57,681 --> 00:35:01,740
the thing about kickboxing is you can
only sparse so much [inaudible] just the

620
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:05,900
little sparring, just little thumps,
you know, just not even full blast,

621
00:35:05,901 --> 00:35:07,650
just getting hit with jabs and stuff.
Your,

622
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:10,670
your head gets rattled and
that's all that accumulates.

623
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:13,610
The acumen of damage inside your brain.
It's just not good.

624
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:16,910
My grandpa was a professional
boxer and uh, yeah,

625
00:35:16,911 --> 00:35:20,510
I mean his end of life wasn't as
good as this beginning of life.

626
00:35:20,511 --> 00:35:21,560
You know what I'm saying?
I mean,

627
00:35:22,130 --> 00:35:25,700
by the time it was over is my dad and me
and probably the only guys that he even

628
00:35:25,701 --> 00:35:29,090
knew the name of half the
time. But uh, I have, uh,

629
00:35:29,091 --> 00:35:32,840
friends that I started out with that have
brain damage now and I knew them when

630
00:35:32,841 --> 00:35:34,640
I didn't.
I knew them when they were fine.

631
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:38,070
And now if I go back to Boston
and I see him, I talk to them. I

632
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:41,340
see it, I see it there. They're
always drunk. That's what it's like.

633
00:35:41,341 --> 00:35:44,550
It's like always being drunk. Yep. Hello
Kitty. Is Everything good out there?

634
00:35:44,551 --> 00:35:49,500
You know, it was, uh, July. Get out there
is to give everything good out there.

635
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:51,270
So the hell repeat stories.

636
00:35:51,271 --> 00:35:54,330
Like they'll just tell you a story and
then repeat it just a minute later and

637
00:35:54,331 --> 00:35:56,970
then try it again like a minute
after that. It's, it's sad.

638
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:00,420
It's sad when you remember how a guy used
to be fine and you're the same age as

639
00:36:00,421 --> 00:36:04,290
him and you look at them and you're
like, oh fuck. Like this is what happens.

640
00:36:04,350 --> 00:36:07,380
This is unavoidable. Then you get hit in
the head too many times is what happens,

641
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:11,220
but you don't get that in Jujitsu.
But you would have a giant advantage dude.

642
00:36:11,221 --> 00:36:13,170
Then when you have fucking
great endurance to man,

643
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:15,030
you'd have a giant and you're a big guy.

644
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:18,420
The endurance that you have is
unusual for a guy's biggest heaviest.

645
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:21,540
Well, that's the thing is that my
body puts on muscle very, very easily,

646
00:36:21,541 --> 00:36:24,980
but I tend to have a more
endurance lifestyle. So my buddies,

647
00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:26,970
I was a little confused. It's like
what the fuck are you doing man? Yeah.

648
00:36:26,971 --> 00:36:31,410
You Dad's a stocky fella as well and a
hell of a fucking cook. Yes, isn't it?

649
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:35,690
Oh Dude, it's dad hooked us up when we're
in Wisconsin. It a deer camp is dabs.

650
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:39,210
The chef. Oh Dude. He
cooked everything man.

651
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,590
He made Chili and it was really good food.
Halibut,

652
00:36:42,591 --> 00:36:47,591
Sufi Che I think to doesn't everything
tastes better after hunting day?

653
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:52,530
Yes. I mean, yeah, you just
use up everything and you,
no matter what you put,

654
00:36:52,531 --> 00:36:54,540
you could put it like a
nasty Bologna Sandwich.

655
00:36:54,570 --> 00:36:57,930
I've enjoyed more Bologna sandwiches
out hunting. I Hate Bologna.

656
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:03,240
Never equaling eight dear heart.
Um, the of a deer that I shot,

657
00:37:03,241 --> 00:37:07,710
we ate it. Maybe what, two hours
later? Yeah. If even if even two hours,

658
00:37:07,711 --> 00:37:12,420
it was amazing. Just fresh off the
frying pan, crackle, boom. Like that.

659
00:37:12,421 --> 00:37:16,410
It doesn't get any fresh and delicious
fresh meat. The hearts like the best.

660
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:20,850
It's the most tender out of a fresh kill
is the heart and you wouldn't think it,

661
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:24,030
you know, but it's actually
like compared to other organs,

662
00:37:24,031 --> 00:37:28,200
you know the heart's a muscle
and a half of what happens.

663
00:37:28,201 --> 00:37:32,970
Like when you shoot your deer rigor comes
into the animal and that's why right

664
00:37:32,971 --> 00:37:33,660
off the bat,

665
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:37,000
you know that back stake might be a little
chewy and then you let it, you know,

666
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:41,040
wait a week or whatever and
what's happening is that
rigorous breaking down and

667
00:37:41,041 --> 00:37:44,730
it's actually, you know the meats
almost decomposing over time.

668
00:37:44,731 --> 00:37:48,150
That's when you get those like dry age
steaks. You're just eating rotten meat.

669
00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:49,440
So good.

670
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:55,170
But I don't take that much time for the
rigor to break down eating so much fresh

671
00:37:55,171 --> 00:37:56,220
meat on mediator.

672
00:37:56,310 --> 00:38:00,360
Now I have a taste for freshmen to have
a taste for that sort of copper metallic

673
00:38:00,370 --> 00:38:01,870
confession closer to your face.
Yeah.

674
00:38:01,910 --> 00:38:06,910
I have a taste for fresh meat that
almost metal taste and I do not like aged

675
00:38:07,381 --> 00:38:09,720
meat. I don't either. I'm 100% with you.

676
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:12,630
I don't need age meat anymore unless
I have to. If I'm at a restaurant,

677
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:17,430
somebody foolish of me. But, um, if I
eat beef, I try to eat a, there's a,

678
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:21,330
I have a ranch that I buy from that's
a near me that's 100% grass fed.

679
00:38:21,570 --> 00:38:24,870
They don't, they don't supplement with
corn at all. And it's a dark red meat.

680
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:28,410
It's like a game meat. It's weird.
It's like the cattle looks different.

681
00:38:28,411 --> 00:38:32,150
It's less fat on it. It looks
natural. Not supposed to,

682
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:36,160
but the grossest thing is when you
go to the butcher and you see the dry

683
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,260
age situation, you see what
they're doing. You're like,

684
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:42,490
the fuck are you doing that mean
you're ruining a big percentage of it,

685
00:38:42,491 --> 00:38:46,760
first of all, because the outside, they
cut it off that rotten brown shit. Yup.

686
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:50,470
It's fucked. Yeah. I don't,
you know, I'm not like,

687
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:54,610
I'm Kinda guy that I eat while I
eat stuff. I kill, I eat game meat,

688
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,800
I eat wild meat.
And when you eat that,

689
00:38:56,830 --> 00:39:00,340
like it's hard to explain to somebody
that doesn't because when you eat that,

690
00:39:00,370 --> 00:39:02,740
it feels like food in your body.

691
00:39:02,741 --> 00:39:07,100
Like you feel regenerated if feels good.
You know,

692
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:10,390
it's like I eat a lot of elk
because I guide hunters for elk.

693
00:39:10,391 --> 00:39:14,710
And that's one thing that I always
hunt and an elk stake is red meat,

694
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:18,970
but it has less cholesterol than
skinless chicken. Wow. So people,

695
00:39:18,971 --> 00:39:22,450
so if your doctor is like no, no
red meat. No, it's not no red meat.

696
00:39:22,451 --> 00:39:27,340
It's no weird human mutated me,
which would be like corn fed,

697
00:39:27,341 --> 00:39:31,780
marbled beef. I uh, like I just
always eat, gave me, and then I,

698
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:32,940
I wasn't even thinking about,

699
00:39:32,950 --> 00:39:36,660
I had some clients show up and they
brought some steaks, like beef sticks.

700
00:39:36,661 --> 00:39:38,470
So I just throw them on the grill.
Like I cook every,

701
00:39:38,471 --> 00:39:42,820
I mean I cook all the time and
girls on fire, I'm like, Holy Shit,

702
00:39:42,821 --> 00:39:43,654
what's going on?

703
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:48,490
And I realize I haven't cooked
a beef steak and probably ever,

704
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:51,430
I don't know. You know, it's a weird
thing to think. Like I just don't,

705
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:54,910
I've never cooked beef. You just
always eat game. Always a game. Yeah.

706
00:39:55,090 --> 00:39:58,960
I wondered if it's a placebo
effect, you know, eating game,

707
00:39:58,990 --> 00:40:00,880
like how good it makes
you feel afterwards.

708
00:40:00,881 --> 00:40:04,000
But the reason why I don't think
it is is because of my kids.

709
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:08,950
I fed my three year old and my five
year old venison and they go at it like

710
00:40:08,951 --> 00:40:11,200
they're fucking starving,
it's crazy.

711
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:14,290
And then they keep eating
it and like this is so good.

712
00:40:14,291 --> 00:40:16,840
And they were really confused cause
they think deers are really cute.

713
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:20,770
They're like, this is deer. And I like
it's deer and they like, it's Yummy.

714
00:40:21,070 --> 00:40:24,410
And I go, yeah tell me in. But I'm
watching them eat it and like it's,

715
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:28,480
they'd eat it way more voraciously.
Is that a word then? They do.

716
00:40:28,481 --> 00:40:29,710
It doesn't sound like
it though. Can Be, it's,

717
00:40:29,711 --> 00:40:34,240
it doesn't sound like it way
more aggressively than they meet.

718
00:40:34,450 --> 00:40:37,780
Like if I give him steak, if I just
chop up beef steak, like they, I'll,

719
00:40:37,790 --> 00:40:41,050
they'll eat it. But there's like a
like what is this? Well you know,

720
00:40:41,051 --> 00:40:41,771
who else gets it?

721
00:40:41,771 --> 00:40:44,740
Our are vegans and like raw food people
on the other end of the spectrum,

722
00:40:44,741 --> 00:40:47,410
the very crunchy sort of hippie
because they'll say the same thing.

723
00:40:47,410 --> 00:40:49,270
I eat this food,
it makes me feel alive.

724
00:40:49,271 --> 00:40:52,390
I can feel like it just
feels better somehow.

725
00:40:52,570 --> 00:40:57,040
It's the same thing with wild meat
there, right? You know vegans are right.

726
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:01,660
I feel great when I eat a lot of
like really fresh leafy vegetables.

727
00:41:01,661 --> 00:41:04,630
I drink Kale shakes all the time in
the morning and I feel fantastic.

728
00:41:04,810 --> 00:41:08,960
I feel all the nutrients in my body that
the problem with vegans of course is

729
00:41:08,961 --> 00:41:12,190
just this crazy self,
righteous moral,

730
00:41:12,191 --> 00:41:15,920
high ground attitude about eating animals.
When I,

731
00:41:16,010 --> 00:41:18,490
I get the idea of not wanting to do harm,

732
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:21,640
but if you look at like real
studies as far as like farming goes,

733
00:41:21,641 --> 00:41:23,860
unless you're growing all
of your own vegetables,

734
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:26,770
it's very likely or
participating in mass death,

735
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:32,140
the death of rabbits and rodents and
the destruction of habitat in order to

736
00:41:32,141 --> 00:41:33,560
plant these crops and

737
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:36,660
God forbid if you use in
fucking pesticides and what,

738
00:41:36,661 --> 00:41:40,310
what damage you're doing to
the environment. Like it's
not that God damn sample.

739
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:41,213
No.

740
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:43,970
Humans create so many extra
nowadays on everything. I mean,

741
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,160
you take a a plant that was never supposed
to be here in planet and you've just

742
00:41:48,161 --> 00:41:51,430
wiped out something that should have been
there. You know what I mean? We cannot,

743
00:41:51,850 --> 00:41:53,140
you can't go back from that.

744
00:41:53,410 --> 00:41:58,150
Yeah. We fucked up a lot of things
like that. Right? Yeah. It's, I dunno,

745
00:41:58,190 --> 00:42:02,740
I, I get where vegans are coming from. I
get someone wanting to be a nice person,

746
00:42:03,070 --> 00:42:05,290
but it's just what I've always said is,
you know,

747
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,240
these animals don't live forever.

748
00:42:07,270 --> 00:42:09,680
They're not bulletproof and
they're made out of food. Yeah.

749
00:42:10,090 --> 00:42:15,030
But you're still going to try and all
wild game by the next. Yes. By 2014.

750
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:19,480
I'm going pig hunting with Steve this
weekend. We're going to, um, uh, to,

751
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:23,290
to hunt wild boar. I'm trying, by
the end of 2014 to be all wild game.

752
00:42:23,350 --> 00:42:24,760
Have you calculated how much you need?

753
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:28,430
Yeah, I've got to kill some big shit.
Yeah. That's where the outcomes into play,

754
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:31,380
like freezer in my house.
We've got to elk in it right now.

755
00:42:31,381 --> 00:42:35,730
We'll run through that for next
season. Yeah. I want to, uh,

756
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:40,230
an elk for sure. And maybe
even a buffalo. The Buffalo,

757
00:42:40,290 --> 00:42:43,560
the buffalo that you got
to get another freezer.

758
00:42:43,630 --> 00:42:47,080
Yeah, that's a partridge family tour bus.
Yeah. We killed the buffalo in Mexico.

759
00:42:47,081 --> 00:42:51,580
It was a young female was the just the
finest meat I've ever had by far in my

760
00:42:51,581 --> 00:42:56,170
entire life. Wow. Fantastic. That
was wild. That episode in Mexico,

761
00:42:56,171 --> 00:43:00,670
because you got to see how these cultures
learn how to preserve their meat.

762
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:03,100
In the absence of
refrigerators and electricity.

763
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:06,580
They came up with all these interesting
methods in order to make sure that the

764
00:43:06,581 --> 00:43:11,500
meat didn't go bad and one of them was
they would take these very thin strips of

765
00:43:11,501 --> 00:43:16,120
steak and then hang it over like a hanger
and it would all dry out and then they

766
00:43:16,121 --> 00:43:19,660
would chop it up and reconstitute
it with water and then cook with it.

767
00:43:19,661 --> 00:43:21,150
It was called the chocolate.
Yeah.

768
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:24,160
I had had my chocolate and
eggs before the Mexican joint,

769
00:43:24,161 --> 00:43:26,860
but I didn't know what the fuck
it was and I just took, I go,

770
00:43:26,861 --> 00:43:29,290
what's good and guys like Machaca
and eggs like, all right man,

771
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:33,550
like beef jerky and eggs. Yeah. Well
it's not though. It's like a pull pull.

772
00:43:33,730 --> 00:43:36,650
Once I reach that instituted then
it's, yeah. Once they get it wet again.

773
00:43:37,230 --> 00:43:42,040
Yeah. You just soak it. Yeah.
They add water to it. Yeah.
I don't, I don't understand.

774
00:43:43,110 --> 00:43:44,920
Oh, okay. Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah.

775
00:43:44,921 --> 00:43:49,300
But it was a wild watching these different
people and these different cultures

776
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:52,600
try to preserve meat and
figure out how they, you know,

777
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:56,230
they would like try to figure
out how to keep it to stay alive.

778
00:43:56,340 --> 00:43:59,140
Once you know you're going to have to
shoot another buffalo and a couple of days

779
00:43:59,141 --> 00:44:00,010
when everything starts rotting.

780
00:44:00,470 --> 00:44:03,660
Can you picture the little old lady on
there that cut that meat up and dried it?

781
00:44:03,670 --> 00:44:07,220
Can you picture her face? My
grandpa has a crush on her. Really?

782
00:44:07,221 --> 00:44:11,660
Your grants crush on her? He did that, uh,

783
00:44:11,870 --> 00:44:14,750
have Alina of duty.

784
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:21,140
That was a great episode. You guys
ate a coyote. That was interesting.

785
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:24,830
It wasn't bad. It wasn't good. It
wasn't bad. That was weird though. What,

786
00:44:24,831 --> 00:44:27,910
what had gotten indeed the both of
your heads, you and Steve Vanilla,

787
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:29,010
she would have fucked up when your,

788
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:32,180
when your guy like me or Steve like
you've been thinking about that since

789
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:36,360
you're four years old, you're like, dude,
I just want to eat a coyote one day.

790
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:39,360
You know, and then it's like you get
two of you together and you're like,

791
00:44:39,361 --> 00:44:42,190
let's go eat some coyote and
see what it tastes like. Well,

792
00:44:42,270 --> 00:44:44,550
I'm going to have to eat one
spin sneaking around my yard.

793
00:44:44,551 --> 00:44:47,640
They're trying to figure out how
to get to my chickens. He Fox.

794
00:44:47,660 --> 00:44:52,340
It's so we'll get there. Oh I know they
will fucking creeps. I was in my, uh,

795
00:44:52,830 --> 00:44:53,663
I was in my yard.

796
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:57,090
I was just about to let the chickens
out and I see this mother fucker looking

797
00:44:57,091 --> 00:45:00,120
through the fence just looking right at
me and they're looking at the chickens

798
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:01,650
like, Whoa, that's kind of creepy.

799
00:45:01,830 --> 00:45:05,220
It's like you have imagined
having a friend and you know
that the friend is safe,

800
00:45:05,221 --> 00:45:09,280
but right outside the door you could
see a guy wants to kill your friend and

801
00:45:09,281 --> 00:45:12,360
he's just trying to figure out a way
to get in and then that's what it was.

802
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:14,430
He's going to get in and kill
your friend with his face.

803
00:45:14,850 --> 00:45:17,490
And his chickens are like my little
friends, you know, they, they lay eggs.

804
00:45:17,491 --> 00:45:20,820
I say hello girls. You know, I
feed them. They, they bucking,

805
00:45:20,821 --> 00:45:22,230
they come near you when the,
you know,

806
00:45:22,231 --> 00:45:25,830
when you come out in this country
fucking dog, what's an eat Mike friends.

807
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:28,170
I had a, we had some chickens,
you know, we're deciding,

808
00:45:28,171 --> 00:45:30,660
okay we're going to let him free cause
they gotta they gotta get out and they

809
00:45:30,661 --> 00:45:33,970
got a pack and they got to get some
bugs and they're just happier. Yeah.

810
00:45:33,990 --> 00:45:37,350
So we let the chickens out. Well I
didn't know their neighbor had a rooster.

811
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:40,500
The rooster comes over. Right.
And he just claims my chickens.

812
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:43,500
And so you'd go out to feed the chickens,
the rooster would come attack you.

813
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:48,270
I mean he would just get up there, spur
your legs, everything. Yeah. So I mean,

814
00:45:48,271 --> 00:45:51,330
this is crazy rooster and we could not
keep him away from the chickens. I mean,

815
00:45:51,331 --> 00:45:54,600
he's raping my ladies.
I want,

816
00:45:54,870 --> 00:45:58,690
my goal was the unfertilized
chicken eggs. Yeah. Yeah.

817
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:01,560
So we're trying to think like we
can't kill this dude's rooster.

818
00:46:01,561 --> 00:46:02,790
I mean that's just not right.

819
00:46:03,030 --> 00:46:07,440
So I got this concrete rooster and
I put it out by the chicken coop.

820
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:10,530
That rooster comes over and just start
to fight in this concrete rooster.

821
00:46:10,650 --> 00:46:13,290
He kicked his own ass and
just left and never came back.

822
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:18,180
So if you have rooster problems,
man, just, just get a statue.

823
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:21,870
I kick his own ass.
That's amazing.

824
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:25,320
What a dumb fucking animal.
He was like scared to come back.

825
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:32,670
Stupid. I was telling this story on
the podcast. I don't know what it was,

826
00:46:32,671 --> 00:46:33,490
but I was a,

827
00:46:33,490 --> 00:46:36,690
I was going outside to close the coop
at night cause I'd forgot to close it.

828
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:39,270
We have, um, our, our lawn,

829
00:46:39,271 --> 00:46:42,390
it's like this large grassy area and
there's an area where the chicken coop is

830
00:46:42,391 --> 00:46:43,770
and they, they uh, you know,

831
00:46:43,771 --> 00:46:45,720
they just wander around in the
grass and eat bugs and shit,

832
00:46:45,721 --> 00:46:50,340
but right outside that is a fence and
there's like this woods and shit. And uh,

833
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:55,400
I was stepping up to the fence and
these d or just start as a middle of the

834
00:46:56,071 --> 00:47:00,490
night, like two o'clock in the morning,
just fucking hauling ass bro Bro. Bro.

835
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:03,570
Fucking not because of me because
something was chasing them.

836
00:47:03,571 --> 00:47:06,510
I just happened to be close enough where
it happened and I don't know what it

837
00:47:06,511 --> 00:47:11,100
was, but I just stood there in silence
and I'm hearing wild kingdom shit.

838
00:47:11,230 --> 00:47:16,230
No hundred pound deer at least running
away from whatever the fuck it was.

839
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:19,230
Maybe coyotes, you know, maybe
a mountain line. I don't know.

840
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:23,250
I thought I saw a coyote like a silhouette
over the in the distance, but it was,

841
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:25,290
you know, like I said, it was pretty
dark out so it's hard to tell,

842
00:47:25,291 --> 00:47:30,010
but no more than a couple,
150 feet at most from me.

843
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:32,980
Cause like this crazy shit taking
place like right in my yard.

844
00:47:33,430 --> 00:47:36,220
I live in Suburbia, you know,
I don't, I don't live in,

845
00:47:36,221 --> 00:47:39,340
never seen a line or lines side.
Seemed to, not in my neighborhood,

846
00:47:39,341 --> 00:47:40,210
but I've seen two ever.

847
00:47:40,211 --> 00:47:42,700
I saw one in Colorado that
actually want to eat and my dog,

848
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:47,170
I had a little dog get killed in Colorado
mountain line. It's a little one.

849
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:52,150
It was my wife's dog. It was say a
Pomeranian American Eskimo mix. Cute dog.

850
00:47:52,151 --> 00:47:53,110
Too Sad.

851
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:56,500
But I have a giant dog and the giant
dog would pal around with the two little

852
00:47:56,501 --> 00:47:59,710
dogs and everything was cool.
But the giant dog hurt his arm.

853
00:47:59,830 --> 00:48:04,300
So he was inside his Paul and he was
inside and the two little dogs are out by

854
00:48:04,301 --> 00:48:07,510
themselves and the mountain
lion was like, okay, this is,

855
00:48:07,511 --> 00:48:09,280
I've been waiting for this.
Here we go.

856
00:48:10,110 --> 00:48:13,470
This year I'm in my hunting lodge might,
my girlfriend was doing some cooking,

857
00:48:13,490 --> 00:48:16,920
the cooking and stuff and so she leaves
our little cabin to go to the lodge,

858
00:48:16,921 --> 00:48:20,250
start breakfast and like dark,
you know, she comes, she's like,

859
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:22,990
I saw mount mine freaked out.
You know,

860
00:48:22,991 --> 00:48:24,480
it was like right here
by the port and I'm like,

861
00:48:24,820 --> 00:48:28,320
wasn't a mountain lion as a deer, you
know, it's like just run over there.

862
00:48:28,321 --> 00:48:32,130
It'll be fine. Okay. So she runs
over there and then all of a sudden,

863
00:48:32,131 --> 00:48:36,420
like a week later these, uh,
we, we left some capes out.

864
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:41,390
Disappearing capes. Yeah. Like elk,
Kate, you know, like, oh the boss,

865
00:48:42,030 --> 00:48:46,290
we skinned, we skin an elk
out, had the head and the
high detached to it, you know,

866
00:48:46,530 --> 00:48:50,400
it just sitting there underneath where
we had all the meat hanging and this is

867
00:48:50,401 --> 00:48:54,900
just like right behind my cabin disappears
and I'm thinking somebody messing

868
00:48:54,901 --> 00:48:57,020
with us, you know, so
we're me and my brother,

869
00:48:57,021 --> 00:49:00,390
I'll blaming everyone who's
hiding these things next day.

870
00:49:00,391 --> 00:49:04,950
It happens again after everybody left this
time. What the Hell is going on? Well,

871
00:49:04,951 --> 00:49:07,890
it snowed that night.
Sure enough, came back.

872
00:49:07,891 --> 00:49:12,150
There's been a cat living just like
right behind the cabin in mountain lion

873
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:15,980
stealing shit. And I was like, oh, okay.
I guess it was kind of, it must've,

874
00:49:15,990 --> 00:49:19,590
it was like right there by the porch
hanging out at night. You know,

875
00:49:19,940 --> 00:49:23,330
I think that was what was going on
with my dogs too because this thing,

876
00:49:23,610 --> 00:49:27,710
what whatever was there had been circling
around the house for a couple of days.

877
00:49:27,711 --> 00:49:29,570
The dogs would go fucking crazy at night,

878
00:49:29,810 --> 00:49:34,280
not just normal crazy but fucking
crazy. Like, and I'd be like,

879
00:49:34,281 --> 00:49:38,150
what are you fuckers barking that come
on inside and that bring them inside and

880
00:49:38,151 --> 00:49:41,900
they'd be like real jumpy and looking
around. So it had been around a while.

881
00:49:41,990 --> 00:49:45,180
It was about 70 pounds, something
like that wasn't a big one, you know?

882
00:49:45,620 --> 00:49:47,960
And then another one
I saw in Santa Monica,

883
00:49:47,990 --> 00:49:51,020
or not a Santa Monica Santa Barbara
just driving down the street at night.

884
00:49:51,340 --> 00:49:54,800
So this thing run across the street and
I thought it was a coyote and then I see

885
00:49:54,801 --> 00:49:59,090
its tail, it's got this floppy cat tail.
I was like, Oh shit, that's a mount mine.

886
00:49:59,180 --> 00:50:02,060
I still don't have a confirmed sighting.
And it pisses me off. It really,

887
00:50:02,070 --> 00:50:03,770
it's like the one thing I
haven't really experienced.

888
00:50:03,820 --> 00:50:05,630
I put this up on my Twitter,
somebody sent me,

889
00:50:05,631 --> 00:50:10,631
this is one a Jack and Jack
dear underneath the feet
or somewhere in Georgia.

890
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:15,140
West Virginia. Yeah. The Guy said it was
West Virginia, but apparently it's not.

891
00:50:15,170 --> 00:50:17,030
Apparently was Georgia,
that original photo.

892
00:50:17,210 --> 00:50:19,580
A lot of people claim their
friends sent that picture,

893
00:50:19,581 --> 00:50:24,110
but it's a big fucking animal man.
Forearms on those fuckers.

894
00:50:24,610 --> 00:50:25,660
Quite a few out in the wild.

895
00:50:25,661 --> 00:50:28,070
A couple of years ago actually
I was fishing in the spring

896
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:32,600
and found one cotton, a log jam
after flood dead one, you know?

897
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:33,980
Yeah.
It was the first.

898
00:50:34,010 --> 00:50:36,740
I've never seen deadline anywhere
and that was the first one.

899
00:50:36,790 --> 00:50:37,910
It's like an inner river.

900
00:50:37,970 --> 00:50:42,710
Steve found a crazy photo that his friends
sent him of an elk that got killed by

901
00:50:42,711 --> 00:50:46,460
a tree. The tree fell and the
elk was literally open mouth,

902
00:50:46,461 --> 00:50:49,660
like this mama side, right. Frozen, solid,

903
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:54,890
frozen solid and see if he could find
that. It's on. Steve Rinella is a Twitter.

904
00:50:55,270 --> 00:50:59,960
Um, but just, it's still freaky. It's
image. It's just like, it's screaming,

905
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:04,100
like as the log landed on it and
killed it, you know, it's just,

906
00:51:04,101 --> 00:51:07,640
it's mouth stayed open as
it died. It was crazy. Yeah.

907
00:51:07,910 --> 00:51:10,910
I guess if you're out there in long
enough, you see enough crazy shit. Yeah.

908
00:51:10,911 --> 00:51:12,380
That's the thing. When
you're out there all, I mean,

909
00:51:12,710 --> 00:51:15,470
you just never know what you're
going to see from day to day. Okay.

910
00:51:15,650 --> 00:51:20,150
Here's the question. Big Foot,
big foot. Is He loud? Yes or no?

911
00:51:21,290 --> 00:51:25,820
I want it to be, you know, I just
can't buy it man. I just don't buy it.

912
00:51:25,850 --> 00:51:28,610
It's uh, I think, uh,

913
00:51:29,990 --> 00:51:33,620
my grandpa used to like get a little
bit liquor shop and he would put on a

914
00:51:33,621 --> 00:51:38,350
gorilla suit. He would run
in boxers. Yeah. He was like,

915
00:51:38,540 --> 00:51:42,650
he's like one of the most crazy person's
is ever walked the face of the earth,

916
00:51:42,651 --> 00:51:45,710
I think. But he would run in
front of logging trucks, you know,

917
00:51:45,770 --> 00:51:50,290
and then they would freak out on
the radios and stuff. And then, uh,

918
00:51:50,510 --> 00:51:51,920
he would go into the bar and I mean,

919
00:51:51,921 --> 00:51:55,450
these dudes would be ghost
white and talking about how
they saw big foot and you

920
00:51:55,451 --> 00:52:00,210
know, in their mind they saw big foot,
you know, and he loved it. You think like,

921
00:52:00,740 --> 00:52:01,580
you see these tracks,

922
00:52:01,581 --> 00:52:06,110
he's the guy that would put big foot feed
on and walk around with his buddy for

923
00:52:06,111 --> 00:52:10,100
no reason. Like they just love to
do that. It's like there's big foot,

924
00:52:10,101 --> 00:52:13,280
but there's dudes that like to make
people think there's big foot more than I

925
00:52:13,281 --> 00:52:16,940
think there's actually a big foot's.
Yeah, I'm with you. Um, I, uh,

926
00:52:16,970 --> 00:52:19,850
I think there's a lot of people that
like to fuck with people and that's

927
00:52:19,851 --> 00:52:21,830
probably a lot of what people
are seeing it up there.

928
00:52:21,890 --> 00:52:26,020
I got approached that this one show by
this dude that was a professional squash,

929
00:52:26,170 --> 00:52:27,590
squash hunt,
right.

930
00:52:28,220 --> 00:52:31,460
And he has a business card and everything
works out of Colorado and he's like,

931
00:52:31,461 --> 00:52:35,330
man, I'll, I'll take you. And he's
like, for, for three grand or whatever,

932
00:52:35,331 --> 00:52:36,200
I'll take you out.
And he's,

933
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:40,190
he's telling me about the
family groups of the squashes,

934
00:52:40,220 --> 00:52:44,720
squashes whatever you gone. And,
uh, how he knows him and he,

935
00:52:44,930 --> 00:52:49,100
and they're really elusive, but he sees
him all the time. And, uh, you know,

936
00:52:49,130 --> 00:52:53,150
he does these guided tours and I'm
thinking to myself, who's crazier?

937
00:52:53,180 --> 00:52:56,420
That dude or the people that go with him,
you know.

938
00:52:56,690 --> 00:52:58,430
And then the other thing is what's,

939
00:52:58,490 --> 00:53:01,670
I don't know if it's crazy or if he
believes himself or if he just straight up

940
00:53:01,671 --> 00:53:05,210
lying to you, you know, like,
does he believe his own bs?

941
00:53:05,630 --> 00:53:09,170
They're all a little delusional.
We, uh, for the Scifi show,

942
00:53:09,171 --> 00:53:13,940
we went to Mount Rainier in
Washington state and we met
a lot of people, uh, that,

943
00:53:13,941 --> 00:53:17,540
uh, had claimed to seen bigfoot.
And some of them were interesting.

944
00:53:17,541 --> 00:53:19,400
There was this one woman
who is really interesting.

945
00:53:19,580 --> 00:53:20,840
She seemed like she was telling the truth.

946
00:53:20,841 --> 00:53:24,080
She saw a bunch of elk run away and
then she saw this thing, she's like,

947
00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:26,340
it was a gorilla. She's like,
I'm looking at a gorilla.

948
00:53:26,340 --> 00:53:30,060
What the fuck? And she was, didn't have
a website. She wasn't selling a book.

949
00:53:30,270 --> 00:53:33,300
She didn't send, it seemed like she was
lying. I don't know what she really saw.

950
00:53:33,301 --> 00:53:36,600
She might've seen a brown bear or a
black bear that was like in the woods,

951
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:40,680
in between, you know, trees. She might
have saw it moving in a weird way.

952
00:53:40,710 --> 00:53:42,360
Convince herself that it was a gorilla.

953
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:44,490
Yeah.
Here's the thing,

954
00:53:44,491 --> 00:53:48,300
I took a criminal justice class and in
the class everybody's sitting in there

955
00:53:48,301 --> 00:53:52,110
with 400 people in this room and the
teacher had somebody come in and steal a

956
00:53:52,111 --> 00:53:55,380
laptop from someone you know in the class.
Like didn't tell anyone.

957
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:57,700
And as everybody write down in
the description, if somebody,

958
00:53:57,750 --> 00:54:01,170
the guy that came in and nobody's
matched up, you know what I mean?

959
00:54:01,171 --> 00:54:05,970
Like your mind tells you what you want to
think. You know, you fill in the blanks,

960
00:54:05,971 --> 00:54:10,230
especially if adrenaline's going
or it's new to you. I mean,

961
00:54:10,231 --> 00:54:13,830
now if it was a guy that say,
I would say is in the woods all the time,

962
00:54:13,831 --> 00:54:16,110
like an expert at animals.

963
00:54:16,111 --> 00:54:19,800
I mean most people in the wild at
deer runs away in a split second.

964
00:54:19,830 --> 00:54:22,230
They don't know if it's a white tail
or a mule deer. Right. You know,

965
00:54:22,231 --> 00:54:27,231
I'm in like how do these people have
the expertise to identify a species when

966
00:54:27,331 --> 00:54:31,530
they, uh, you know, or half a mile
away, they don't have proper equipment.

967
00:54:31,531 --> 00:54:33,150
And they were going, oh
yeah, I saw a big foot.

968
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:35,390
And you're seeing it for a
half a half a second. Yeah.

969
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:40,020
Two second period of time. Two
seconds is one, two, boom. It's gone.

970
00:54:40,140 --> 00:54:41,940
And then your memory has to feel it

971
00:54:41,950 --> 00:54:45,160
when all this, what was it? And
then you tell yourself what it was.

972
00:54:46,210 --> 00:54:49,320
If we spend enough time in the woods,
I will get one on camera. Yeah.

973
00:54:49,370 --> 00:54:50,830
If they exist,
if it exists.

974
00:54:51,310 --> 00:54:53,830
How much time do you guys ever
spend in the Pacific northwest,

975
00:54:53,831 --> 00:54:57,280
which seems to be like the hotbed
for sidings. Just southeast Alaska.

976
00:54:57,281 --> 00:55:00,930
We spend a lot of time there, but not
much in Washington if they're anywhere,

977
00:55:00,950 --> 00:55:02,550
they're in Canada.
The only one that

978
00:55:02,620 --> 00:55:05,290
I believe is Les Stroud.
Survivor man. Yeah.

979
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:08,850
He told me he had an
encounter Ridell market.

980
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:14,550
Well,
he said he was in his tent hand

981
00:55:14,690 --> 00:55:17,650
and he said he had heard something earlier
in the day that was weird. He here,

982
00:55:17,690 --> 00:55:20,580
he'd heard some something
walking through the woods, uh,

983
00:55:20,581 --> 00:55:21,950
but he didn't see anything.

984
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:26,690
And then he said he was in his tent
at night and uh, it was, uh, you know,

985
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:31,340
pitch black in Alaska and in the middle
of nowhere flew two hours by plane to

986
00:55:31,341 --> 00:55:32,510
get there to land on this lake.

987
00:55:32,511 --> 00:55:36,290
And then they get out and be in his
tent and he heard some stomping.

988
00:55:36,470 --> 00:55:37,970
Like you heard something that was clearly,

989
00:55:37,971 --> 00:55:41,600
it seemed like by pedal that was walking
around and he said it was like total

990
00:55:41,601 --> 00:55:44,880
silence and he heard this thing
and then he heard it, you know,

991
00:55:45,150 --> 00:55:48,260
I think he said like less than a
hundred feet away from him cola

992
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:51,410
make this crazy noise,

993
00:55:51,411 --> 00:55:55,040
like a primate noise that he thought
and he goes and reaches for his camera.

994
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:58,640
It hears his movement and just
runs away. Hmm. Interesting. Yeah,

995
00:55:58,641 --> 00:55:59,474
it's very interesting.

996
00:55:59,690 --> 00:56:02,690
The reason to me that it's interesting
is because that fucking guy goes

997
00:56:02,870 --> 00:56:03,501
everywhere.

998
00:56:03,501 --> 00:56:07,940
He'll go to the middle of nowhere and
survive and he's not a bullshit artist.

999
00:56:07,941 --> 00:56:12,290
He seems legit. If it ended up being that
he wasn't legit, that'd be pretty sad.

1000
00:56:12,350 --> 00:56:17,300
I would be like, then doubt, my
ability to take on it was like, look,

1001
00:56:17,301 --> 00:56:21,020
if you're, you want another beer, whatever
you want, man, I just, water's good. Um,

1002
00:56:21,140 --> 00:56:23,260
here's his take on it.
Was that like,

1003
00:56:23,261 --> 00:56:27,570
how often do you see a wolverine if you're
just hiking, how often do you see, uh,

1004
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:27,851
you know,

1005
00:56:27,851 --> 00:56:30,910
there's a lot of animals that exists
out there and these aren't even smart

1006
00:56:30,911 --> 00:56:34,300
animals. If this thing was living
in the Pacific northwest, he's like,

1007
00:56:34,301 --> 00:56:38,830
it's so dense up there and there's so
much area where people just don't get to

1008
00:56:38,860 --> 00:56:42,370
that. Something could possibly
live in small numbers there.

1009
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:44,700
That's his tail a lot.

1010
00:56:44,740 --> 00:56:48,490
But the problem is everybody I talked
to that believes they've seen it almost

1011
00:56:48,491 --> 00:56:52,960
everybody. It's just the cookie. They're
fucking, they're nutty people, man.

1012
00:56:52,990 --> 00:56:54,190
They just,
this is not a,

1013
00:56:54,191 --> 00:56:59,191
like a doctor who was just on vacation
and saw something and had this definitive

1014
00:56:59,621 --> 00:57:03,190
sighting and the lack of
trail camera pictures,

1015
00:57:03,550 --> 00:57:05,350
zero trail camera pictures.

1016
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:07,300
And there there's crazy enough dudes,

1017
00:57:07,301 --> 00:57:11,170
it will dedicate their whole lives to
finding it. You know, I mean, they exist.

1018
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:15,820
We've got, we've got, but now did
you hear about the, um, they, this,

1019
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:20,880
they were doing a bare studies in the
Sierras and one of the researchers got a

1020
00:57:21,131 --> 00:57:22,720
trail camera,
picture of a wolverine.

1021
00:57:23,170 --> 00:57:26,260
They didn't know what marines were still
in the Sierras. Wow. And it's like,

1022
00:57:26,620 --> 00:57:29,900
where's this wolverine come from?
You know, I've been in this,

1023
00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:33,220
I've spent a lot of my life and
this year has never seen wolverine,

1024
00:57:33,221 --> 00:57:36,910
never seen a track and never even thought
of singing overing and here they've

1025
00:57:36,911 --> 00:57:39,580
got, you know, you know,
legitimate biologists found it.

1026
00:57:39,820 --> 00:57:42,310
Well, how about that mountain
line they found in Connecticut?

1027
00:57:42,850 --> 00:57:45,790
I didn't hear about that. Not every
wine freelancer everywhere now. Well,

1028
00:57:45,870 --> 00:57:50,620
it came from South Dakota and walked from
South Dakota to Connecticut. They when,

1029
00:57:50,621 --> 00:57:53,980
when it died, something to get hit by
a car or something. And in Connecticut,

1030
00:57:54,430 --> 00:57:57,970
whatever killed it. And Connecticut,
they, they, they did the lineage on this.

1031
00:57:58,040 --> 00:58:01,960
They apparently had noon knew where this
animal came from and we were able to

1032
00:58:01,961 --> 00:58:05,200
trace it all the way back to South Dakota.
So I walk a thousand fucking miles.

1033
00:58:05,620 --> 00:58:09,160
It's a trip. Yeah. That's pretty crazy.
It's kind of lying and Connecticut.

1034
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:12,550
There's coyotes in the Bronx, like,
yeah, the big park up there. We'll,

1035
00:58:12,551 --> 00:58:16,090
Chicago has a fucking whole population
of them. They know that the story.

1036
00:58:16,420 --> 00:58:20,740
Chicago park has a whole population of
them. They have a whole population of a,

1037
00:58:20,741 --> 00:58:24,370
of coyotes that are apparently a part
of the, the ecosystem they're eating.

1038
00:58:24,371 --> 00:58:27,830
What garbage? Eating rats.
No Shit. Well, that's good.

1039
00:58:28,220 --> 00:58:30,310
Let me make sure this is not Chicago,
not Detroit.

1040
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:34,840
I'm sure
most big cities have coyote population.

1041
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:36,201
I've seen a,

1042
00:58:36,201 --> 00:58:39,250
I've seen pictures of coyotes
just carrying like license
plates down the street.

1043
00:58:40,740 --> 00:58:44,640
I didn't, uh, yeah, it is. Uh, it is,
uh, there's, they have them tracked.

1044
00:58:44,641 --> 00:58:48,930
It's an ecological study of coyotes
and the Chicago metropolitan area area.

1045
00:58:49,590 --> 00:58:52,500
I didn't even see anyone until
I came to La and I was uh,

1046
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:55,500
I was staying in Burbank when I first
moved here and I was driving down the

1047
00:58:55,501 --> 00:58:57,990
street and I see three Coyote's walking
down the street. And I was like,

1048
00:58:58,230 --> 00:59:02,370
this is something like apocalyptic
shit. These creepy, a little murderers.

1049
00:59:02,420 --> 00:59:05,310
Oh all look a little cute.
Coyote puppies.

1050
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:07,710
Y'All in Chicago.

1051
00:59:08,820 --> 00:59:11,150
They're all good until they get hungry
and they start eating your kids.

1052
00:59:11,560 --> 00:59:15,990
Kid's your lap dogs. Yeah. And then
you realize, oh, these are creeps.

1053
00:59:16,410 --> 00:59:20,290
These are creepy little predators
that live amongst us. I knew a lady.

1054
00:59:20,291 --> 00:59:22,220
You've got a little dog snatched

1055
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:25,850
right off. Release trolling
for trolling for coyotes. Yeah,

1056
00:59:26,570 --> 00:59:28,070
one of the coyote fishing.

1057
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:33,590
What are the challenges that we're looking
to do for the new show is to harvest

1058
00:59:33,591 --> 00:59:37,460
some coyotes and then take the skins
and wrap ourselves in the skins and then

1059
00:59:37,461 --> 00:59:41,450
getting close, like sneaking on an animal
using k using camouflage of the Kyle.

1060
00:59:41,510 --> 00:59:44,210
It's like pretend to be accountable.
Let's talk about that new show.

1061
00:59:44,211 --> 00:59:48,230
Why don't you, uh, Jamie, let's play the
clip that I emailed you. Apex Predator.

1062
00:59:48,290 --> 00:59:51,980
Yeah. Apex Predator. This
is a new show that uh,

1063
00:59:52,010 --> 00:59:56,510
Dan's producing mommy's going to
be a part of. Let's check this out.

1064
00:59:56,511 --> 00:59:57,590
Now it's on the media.

1065
00:59:57,750 --> 00:59:58,583
Yeah,

1066
01:00:00,580 --> 01:00:02,860
there is,
but one law of the land

1067
01:00:05,990 --> 01:00:07,610
kill or be killed.

1068
01:00:13,890 --> 01:00:18,330
In life there is death,
but in death

1069
01:00:19,980 --> 01:00:20,813
there is life.

1070
01:00:21,850 --> 01:00:25,890
It took command thousands of years to
climb to the top of the food chain,

1071
01:00:27,450 --> 01:00:28,710
but we didn't do it alone.

1072
01:00:30,450 --> 01:00:33,840
Nature itself was our teacher
and those who hunted us,

1073
01:00:34,690 --> 01:00:35,860
he our guides.

1074
01:00:44,230 --> 01:00:46,960
And though in today's world
we have no natural predators,

1075
01:00:48,070 --> 01:00:52,630
there are still many timeless lessons
that nature can teach us to hold our

1076
01:00:52,631 --> 01:00:56,590
hunting skills and earn the right
to be called apex predators.

1077
01:01:00,840 --> 01:01:05,760
If you look at humans, what's pushed
us forward? They need to survive.

1078
01:01:06,150 --> 01:01:10,620
How do we survive by eating?
What do we eat other animals?

1079
01:01:11,250 --> 01:01:16,250
So what we're doing here is essentially
something I like to call hunt science,

1080
01:01:17,550 --> 01:01:21,420
the science of how things have
hunted and how things have evolved.

1081
01:01:24,300 --> 01:01:27,480
In order to do this,
we need to break it down into pieces,

1082
01:01:27,590 --> 01:01:29,550
dissected every bit of nature.

1083
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:34,710
He didn't attempt to adapt and
replicate the strategies, skills,

1084
01:01:34,860 --> 01:01:37,800
and techniques are the most
proficient hunters in the world.

1085
01:01:40,050 --> 01:01:43,170
Concealment
Stealth,

1086
01:01:44,610 --> 01:01:47,570
tracking
in guarantees,

1087
01:01:48,700 --> 01:01:52,050
mental focus and heightened
sensory perception

1088
01:01:54,840 --> 01:01:58,800
by studying nature and analyzing the
traits of the fiercest hunters on earth.

1089
01:01:59,820 --> 01:02:00,450
All device,

1090
01:02:00,450 --> 01:02:04,830
unorthodox training techniques to push
beyond my limits in a modern technical

1091
01:02:04,831 --> 01:02:09,060
hunter and tap into the primal
instinct of Apex Predator.

1092
01:02:13,230 --> 01:02:15,720
It's the first morning
the sun isn't even up yet.

1093
01:02:15,780 --> 01:02:19,050
We've already got a herd of elk.
Every,

1094
01:02:19,260 --> 01:02:22,230
I've seen wolves catch, you know, they've,

1095
01:02:22,290 --> 01:02:27,290
they've started in a funnel like this
where one wolf will be on an opposite rig

1096
01:02:27,870 --> 01:02:31,590
and we'll kind of how back and forth
and then one will make their new.

1097
01:02:31,860 --> 01:02:35,230
By the time they get to the second one,
we've already started to wear her down.

1098
01:02:35,580 --> 01:02:39,080
We can keep them in this bowl.
We have the upper hand.

1099
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:44,930
Yeah.
So when then wolf signing,

1100
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:49,460
the first thing he's gonna do is sneak
into the herd and then get the hurting

1101
01:02:49,470 --> 01:02:52,970
moving once he gets the herd. Moving.

1102
01:02:53,270 --> 01:02:55,580
PACS and job is to cause confusion.

1103
01:02:56,090 --> 01:03:00,650
What this'll do is separate is prey and
his intended target from the rest of the

1104
01:03:00,651 --> 01:03:05,210
herd. Now he'll continue to push
me out to the point of exhaustion.

1105
01:03:05,690 --> 01:03:10,570
The Wolf's goal is to maintain his
energy levels while wearing the elk down.

1106
01:03:12,260 --> 01:03:15,860
Once the elk is on the new,
the wolf skin to try to cut him off,

1107
01:03:16,190 --> 01:03:17,490
we can see out on the region.

1108
01:03:19,100 --> 01:03:22,280
Let's just keep hitting them back
and forth with King first day,

1109
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:23,673
let's just kind of

1110
01:03:24,920 --> 01:03:29,920
disoriented after he's cut the herd of
elk off and then he's gonna move in for

1111
01:03:30,171 --> 01:03:31,004
the kill.

1112
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:50,833
That looks bad

1113
01:03:53,950 --> 01:03:56,950
coming fall 2014 where are you
guys going to have this song?

1114
01:03:56,951 --> 01:03:59,160
What's it going to be on? That's
a secret. That's a secret.

1115
01:03:59,161 --> 01:04:01,960
It's just he's still in negotiation.
Yeah, still trying to figure that out.

1116
01:04:01,990 --> 01:04:04,180
It looks dope though. It looks,
it's very excited. Thank you.

1117
01:04:04,181 --> 01:04:07,330
I get excited about it. It seems
like sneaking up on an elk with a,

1118
01:04:07,331 --> 01:04:10,390
with a bow might be one of the
most fucking thrilling things ever.

1119
01:04:11,030 --> 01:04:15,580
So on that episode, what our goal
was was it wasn't sneak up on them.

1120
01:04:15,910 --> 01:04:20,710
We actually pushed them and then
random down, exhausted, exhausted.

1121
01:04:20,740 --> 01:04:24,230
Yeah. Wow. Like it's almost sort
of a persistent Sinai as a person.

1122
01:04:24,231 --> 01:04:27,280
It's not anything we're, well, what
we did was we tried to do it like,

1123
01:04:27,310 --> 01:04:29,280
like a pack of wolves would.
So we,

1124
01:04:29,281 --> 01:04:32,860
we went in here with the idea that the
only way we're going to kill one is if we

1125
01:04:32,861 --> 01:04:33,890
do it like a wolf would.

1126
01:04:34,090 --> 01:04:37,300
Now we have to have a bow because that's
like the law and everything. I mean,

1127
01:04:37,780 --> 01:04:42,310
Ruby like hell, it's try spears, but
it's not legal, you know? Um, so we,

1128
01:04:42,311 --> 01:04:46,600
so we got the herd, we snuck in like
the wolves would, then we pushed him.

1129
01:04:46,601 --> 01:04:48,470
And then what we did was the,

1130
01:04:48,530 --> 01:04:52,390
the elk kind of have these escape routes.
And because I mean,

1131
01:04:52,391 --> 01:04:56,650
I've spent accumulation of just,
if you just counted the straight days,

1132
01:04:56,920 --> 01:04:59,420
it'd be like something like six
years chasing these elk, you know,

1133
01:04:59,421 --> 01:05:03,000
and just like straight 365 days a year,

1134
01:05:03,010 --> 01:05:06,570
six years worth of if you
added up all the time. And, uh,

1135
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:08,020
so I mean,

1136
01:05:08,320 --> 01:05:12,190
I really know this herd and how they
move and elk in general, you know,

1137
01:05:12,191 --> 01:05:15,330
I've studied elk for a long time and uh,

1138
01:05:15,640 --> 01:05:18,070
so what we did was while elk would go up

1139
01:05:18,070 --> 01:05:22,660
and down every ridge, we would run up and
catch them up, know, like cut them off.

1140
01:05:22,750 --> 01:05:25,420
So they would like,
we'd be racing to the same place,

1141
01:05:25,750 --> 01:05:29,590
but they would be going a harder
route, you know, so they would be like,

1142
01:05:29,591 --> 01:05:31,450
their tongues are hanging out,
they're tired.

1143
01:05:31,660 --> 01:05:35,680
And what we're trying to do is get in
front of them hoping that by the time we

1144
01:05:35,681 --> 01:05:40,681
catch up and run them long enough that
they are tired and are just like walking

1145
01:05:40,841 --> 01:05:42,550
past us and we can kill them.

1146
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:46,990
You have to be in fucking crazy shaped
to get elk tired. It was ambitious.

1147
01:05:48,700 --> 01:05:52,750
Fucking elk run a fat. They're huge. They
do the thing that we have going for us,

1148
01:05:52,751 --> 01:05:57,730
those, I mean, uh, like humans can sweat.
Yes. Animals can't make pant. You know,

1149
01:05:57,731 --> 01:06:00,220
they've got, they've got their
tongues out, they're tired fast.

1150
01:06:00,221 --> 01:06:03,850
There are big animal, you know,
we are really light. We're mobile.

1151
01:06:03,851 --> 01:06:07,480
We can carry water, we can refuel.
If an elk wants to refuel, you know,

1152
01:06:07,481 --> 01:06:11,660
how much grass he has to eat because
they don't break us. I mean grasses,

1153
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:14,080
the hardest thing to digest on the planet,
you know,

1154
01:06:14,210 --> 01:06:15,940
and they need special enzymes to do it.

1155
01:06:15,941 --> 01:06:20,200
We can just power down a shot blocks
or whatever and just keep running.

1156
01:06:20,530 --> 01:06:23,670
It's really fascinating to actually look
at the science behind it and find out

1157
01:06:23,671 --> 01:06:26,710
what a human is capable of compared
to a four, a four legged animal.

1158
01:06:26,711 --> 01:06:30,580
Because in endurance situations
we have a pretty good situation.

1159
01:06:30,610 --> 01:06:33,820
Like it's something that humans can do.
And what things, the big part of it,

1160
01:06:34,420 --> 01:06:36,040
it's a big part of it.
But also,

1161
01:06:36,280 --> 01:06:40,740
I mean a little bit of like
kind of how like wolves hunt is,

1162
01:06:40,770 --> 01:06:45,220
is a lot of intelligence. You
know, they outsmart their prey. Um,

1163
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:48,940
and a lot of it's the pack mentality.
Hunting is a pack. Pushing them.

1164
01:06:48,941 --> 01:06:53,680
Like we kind of created this pack and
in that episode we created a pack where,

1165
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:57,310
you know, myself and my brother were
hunters. And then we also have, you know,

1166
01:06:57,580 --> 01:07:01,390
we aren't, we're filming this
so we have guys with cameras.

1167
01:07:01,660 --> 01:07:05,750
So we incorporate them in the pack
as part of the strategy and uh,

1168
01:07:06,360 --> 01:07:08,950
gets a little while to get
to western. You know, I mean,

1169
01:07:08,951 --> 01:07:13,690
you're trying to film yourself and
for other dudes are three other dudes,

1170
01:07:14,140 --> 01:07:18,130
chase elk through the mountains and to
the point where you can kill one like a

1171
01:07:18,131 --> 01:07:22,180
wolf would. Well, it's cool that you're
taking a novel approach to, to uh,

1172
01:07:22,181 --> 01:07:25,870
another outdoors slash hunting type show.
You know,

1173
01:07:25,980 --> 01:07:30,340
this is a very novel approach.
I like the science part of it the best.

1174
01:07:30,341 --> 01:07:33,280
It's just like we're doing these little
experiments like learning about what an

1175
01:07:33,281 --> 01:07:37,360
animal actually has in it's biology and
then like seeing if we could match it

1176
01:07:37,810 --> 01:07:40,530
and learning about it. And the process
to me is just fucking fascinating.

1177
01:07:40,650 --> 01:07:43,210
And in each episode two,
there's a huge training element.

1178
01:07:43,211 --> 01:07:45,820
It's not like we're trying to bullshit
people, you know, it was like,

1179
01:07:45,850 --> 01:07:50,170
if I'm going to do this, man, I've got
to learn something and try to adapt it.

1180
01:07:50,650 --> 01:07:52,120
And so, you know, we went out there and,

1181
01:07:52,300 --> 01:07:55,150
and that's where that vo two Max test
they were talking about earlier as part of

1182
01:07:55,151 --> 01:07:58,450
this episode where it's like, okay,
how do we stack up against wolves?

1183
01:07:58,780 --> 01:08:02,050
And it's like, dude, you're aren't
gonna Stack. I mean we, we ended up,

1184
01:08:02,051 --> 01:08:06,250
we got like this 90% Wolfen race that Jay
and it wasn't like I'm going to beat a

1185
01:08:06,251 --> 01:08:08,860
wolf. Oh No. He's just like, it was like,

1186
01:08:08,861 --> 01:08:13,120
let's see how bad I get my ass kicked in
the mountains so you know where I stand.

1187
01:08:13,121 --> 01:08:16,190
Like is this even going to be possible?
Because if you tell like a normal

1188
01:08:16,200 --> 01:08:19,670
hundred like, yeah, we're going to run
an elk down and kill it, run it down yet,

1189
01:08:19,700 --> 01:08:21,410
bullshit. You know, right now,

1190
01:08:21,411 --> 01:08:24,080
how are we going to go about this and
is it even possible after we raised the

1191
01:08:24,081 --> 01:08:26,240
dog, we're like, this isn't going to work.

1192
01:08:27,560 --> 01:08:29,690
And we went and did the vo two
Max test and everyone's like,

1193
01:08:30,050 --> 01:08:32,590
well if anyone on this plan, it's going
to do it. It's probably going to be you.

1194
01:08:32,640 --> 01:08:35,560
You know, you learn that. Uh,

1195
01:08:35,630 --> 01:08:38,480
so Remy had an extraordinarily
high vo two Max Score,

1196
01:08:38,481 --> 01:08:42,080
but it wasn't a third of what a train
canine is like a dog that's in shape is

1197
01:08:42,081 --> 01:08:45,050
something in the range of 300,
which is just sending us,

1198
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:48,640
did you ever see the Werner Herzog film
happy people? Yeah. Life that taiga.

1199
01:08:48,760 --> 01:08:52,160
Do you remember when the guy comes back
to camp on his snowmobile and the dog

1200
01:08:52,161 --> 01:08:53,450
falls in the entire way?

1201
01:08:53,960 --> 01:08:58,580
Doug runs the whole distance and sell
like a full day of writing this fucking

1202
01:08:58,610 --> 01:09:03,080
the snowmobile. The dog is just full clip
trotting next to him for the whole day.

1203
01:09:03,760 --> 01:09:06,410
I think those,
like I did a rod canines are some of the,

1204
01:09:06,710 --> 01:09:10,400
they're the most fit animal on
the planet. God, that's crazy.

1205
01:09:10,401 --> 01:09:13,340
Imagine they don't have sweat either.
It doesn't matter.

1206
01:09:13,370 --> 01:09:17,030
They're just designed for that. Yup.
And, and they got that pack thing going.

1207
01:09:17,031 --> 01:09:20,150
I mean, they're all running together,
you know, he's just like, you know,

1208
01:09:20,151 --> 01:09:23,210
when you go do something with like
your friends that are pretty hardcore,

1209
01:09:23,360 --> 01:09:26,880
you ended up doing more than you wanted
to. You know? It's like, it's like any,

1210
01:09:26,930 --> 01:09:30,200
anytime I tried to go do something,
I'll go with guys that are better than me,

1211
01:09:30,410 --> 01:09:32,600
you know, because it's just going
to push you further than you think.

1212
01:09:32,601 --> 01:09:35,450
So those dogs getting his pack and
they just start pushing each other,

1213
01:09:35,451 --> 01:09:36,950
pushing each other, pushing
each other, you know?

1214
01:09:37,190 --> 01:09:39,860
And that happened to us while we
were out there. It's like, you know,

1215
01:09:40,040 --> 01:09:41,460
here's Dan and,
and uh,

1216
01:09:41,810 --> 01:09:44,720
dawn was another guy that was running
the camera and here were all out there

1217
01:09:44,721 --> 01:09:49,721
just like kicking our own asses and
everybody's doing it and it was awesome.

1218
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:54,740
You can't, you can't really underestimate
the power of influence, the power,

1219
01:09:54,870 --> 01:09:58,100
the influence of a other bad
motherfuckers that are around you.

1220
01:09:58,250 --> 01:10:00,290
That's why I've always tell people,
if you want to have a good life,

1221
01:10:00,410 --> 01:10:02,780
surround yourself with a bunch
of bad motherfuckers. Exactly.

1222
01:10:02,810 --> 01:10:04,400
They're doing a bunch of bad ass shit.

1223
01:10:04,610 --> 01:10:06,170
You're going to want to do bad
ass shit and you're going to,

1224
01:10:06,171 --> 01:10:08,510
and we're going to want to keep up with
them when you're going to be around them.

1225
01:10:08,511 --> 01:10:11,420
Your standards would be higher
if you're the most bad ass guy,

1226
01:10:11,421 --> 01:10:12,590
you know you aren't going anywhere.

1227
01:10:13,220 --> 01:10:16,420
That's one of the reasons why it's
really dangerous in camps like it.

1228
01:10:16,460 --> 01:10:19,970
Mixed martial arts camps that comes into
play with you are the Alpha dog of the

1229
01:10:19,971 --> 01:10:24,050
camp because people sort of Beta you and
you know you kick everybody's ass and

1230
01:10:24,051 --> 01:10:26,720
then you go in there with another alpha.
You're not used to dealing with that.

1231
01:10:26,721 --> 01:10:27,050
You don't,

1232
01:10:27,050 --> 01:10:31,070
you're not used to like rising to the
occasion when you're confronted with an

1233
01:10:31,071 --> 01:10:33,140
equal adversary and it comes down to,
you know,

1234
01:10:33,350 --> 01:10:38,060
focus and discipline and willpower. Yeah,
it's good to be king, but I guess not.

1235
01:10:39,060 --> 01:10:39,811
No,
no good.

1236
01:10:39,811 --> 01:10:44,811
It's good to be one bad motherfucker in
a troop of other bad motherfuckers all,

1237
01:10:45,501 --> 01:10:49,820
you know, become a brotherhood and
push each other. That's, that's a,

1238
01:10:49,821 --> 01:10:53,660
that's an interesting thing. Everybody
wants that. The alleviation of pressure.

1239
01:10:53,810 --> 01:10:55,940
They want to be the top dog,
but there's,

1240
01:10:55,980 --> 01:10:59,630
that's a trap trap because
if you become that,

1241
01:10:59,631 --> 01:11:03,440
then you don't grow and then you're done.
You know it's his time to die.

1242
01:11:03,830 --> 01:11:07,880
There is no, there's no peace. No one
gets peace. There will be no rest.

1243
01:11:07,970 --> 01:11:10,610
You never get to retire. You
know? Like someone said to me,

1244
01:11:10,611 --> 01:11:14,310
what are you gonna do when you attire?
I go die. That'd be when I'm dead.

1245
01:11:14,311 --> 01:11:17,070
I'm not retiring from Shit
and was the songs of live.

1246
01:11:17,071 --> 01:11:19,470
I'm going to keep doing what
I enjoy doing. You know?

1247
01:11:19,471 --> 01:11:21,090
And maybe some of it won't make any money,

1248
01:11:21,091 --> 01:11:23,820
but I treated the same way as the
shit that I do that does make money.

1249
01:11:24,150 --> 01:11:28,020
There's no retiring. Shut up, bitch.
There's no, there's no golden rainbow.

1250
01:11:28,021 --> 01:11:29,910
There's no, no, there's no fucking boat.

1251
01:11:29,911 --> 01:11:32,070
You're going to get off and you're
going to die. You're going to live,

1252
01:11:32,071 --> 01:11:35,760
you're gonna die while you're alive. Stay
alive. Stay alive and keep moving. Yeah.

1253
01:11:35,761 --> 01:11:39,330
This idea that we just go out to
pasture for third of our life is like,

1254
01:11:39,850 --> 01:11:43,740
okay, those are your golden
years. I don't know about that. I,

1255
01:11:44,040 --> 01:11:46,750
I'm going to go hard just
as long as I can. You know,

1256
01:11:46,850 --> 01:11:48,590
I'm riding this pitch
right into the rocks.

1257
01:11:50,930 --> 01:11:54,020
Keep the throttle going
and when it hits the beach,

1258
01:11:54,050 --> 01:11:57,890
just hope your momentum carries
you right into the rocks. Boom.

1259
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:03,230
Otherwise, fuck it, man. Those
last few years are terrible.

1260
01:12:03,680 --> 01:12:06,140
They're all on antidepressants,
sir.

1261
01:12:07,150 --> 01:12:12,140
Drill it into your fucking lemonade.
Get outta here man. What can we come on?

1262
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:16,670
What are you trying to do? My buddy
always said he'd start doing heroin.

1263
01:12:16,700 --> 01:12:21,620
Returned 83 that's good. That's good
here. Yeah. If I had like terminal cancer,

1264
01:12:21,621 --> 01:12:25,280
boom. Heroin's a first shit. I try. I
want to know what the fuss is all about.

1265
01:12:25,590 --> 01:12:26,423
You know,

1266
01:12:26,830 --> 01:12:29,960
I'm getting a fast car and see if I
can drive across the country backwards.

1267
01:12:32,360 --> 01:12:36,170
Your gears are blow up. How long do you
think are good car can go in reverse.

1268
01:12:36,650 --> 01:12:41,050
Even go a mile. Oh yeah,
yeah. Maybe ship. No,

1269
01:12:41,170 --> 01:12:43,790
they're not.
This one gear though.

1270
01:12:43,970 --> 01:12:46,340
Like if you had to drive in
first gear across the country,

1271
01:12:46,370 --> 01:12:50,600
how long would that last? You know,
fucking your transmission would explode.

1272
01:12:50,601 --> 01:12:54,020
It'd be like, what are you doing
stupid fucking rebs in this thing.

1273
01:12:56,260 --> 01:13:00,920
Something we give out, I dunno,
whatever that means. Nothing. Um,

1274
01:13:01,100 --> 01:13:05,720
being in, uh, this, uh,
this world where you hunt,

1275
01:13:05,900 --> 01:13:08,570
you know,
200 plus 300 plus days a year,

1276
01:13:09,910 --> 01:13:14,210
what's the reaction when you talk to
like a normal person who doesn't have

1277
01:13:14,211 --> 01:13:17,900
anything to do with hunting and they
find out you do so much of this hunting,

1278
01:13:18,080 --> 01:13:21,050
what does, what does the standard
reaction? Is there a typical reaction?

1279
01:13:21,160 --> 01:13:22,060
Yeah, actually. I mean,

1280
01:13:22,061 --> 01:13:24,820
I think most people are like
receptive of it and they're like,

1281
01:13:24,821 --> 01:13:28,090
that's bad ass because it will
for a lot of reasons. One,

1282
01:13:28,091 --> 01:13:32,380
it's like very few people do what they
love every single day. Like I tell people,

1283
01:13:32,381 --> 01:13:35,890
I've never worked a day in my life, you
know, I mean, I love it so much. If,

1284
01:13:35,910 --> 01:13:37,990
if I had to choose what I was going to do,

1285
01:13:38,020 --> 01:13:41,980
it'd be what I'm doing and I don't
care who you are, what you like. Like,

1286
01:13:42,250 --> 01:13:45,940
people respect that, you know, if somebody
tells me something that they're into,

1287
01:13:45,941 --> 01:13:49,120
you know, maybe like ballet,
it's like not my thing.

1288
01:13:49,121 --> 01:13:52,150
But if that's your thing and you're
doing it and you love it, that's cool.

1289
01:13:52,210 --> 01:13:55,570
Like that's, that crosses any barrier
of what, you know, what you don't know,

1290
01:13:55,571 --> 01:13:58,270
you know? Um, because I think a
lot of people aspire for that.

1291
01:13:58,750 --> 01:14:03,550
And then the other part is, I mean,
a lot of people now more than ever,

1292
01:14:03,551 --> 01:14:07,990
I think this idea of
hunting and kind of living,

1293
01:14:07,991 --> 01:14:09,670
maybe not necessarily living off the land,

1294
01:14:09,671 --> 01:14:13,780
but just being there eating wild
meats and other things. It's like,

1295
01:14:14,110 --> 01:14:18,700
it's a trend that's popular now and people
are interested in it. I think I've, uh,

1296
01:14:19,240 --> 01:14:23,080
like people find out, they're
like, really? You do that?
Ah, man, what do you eat it?

1297
01:14:23,081 --> 01:14:27,310
Yeah. You know, like, I'd like
to try that or you know, I mean,

1298
01:14:27,340 --> 01:14:31,570
just also people ask, you know, a lot of
crazy questions like, what? Uh, you know,

1299
01:14:31,571 --> 01:14:33,100
like, what's the craziest
thing you've ever seen?

1300
01:14:33,101 --> 01:14:36,010
What's the craziest thing you've
ever done? Because it's a wildlife,

1301
01:14:36,011 --> 01:14:37,150
it's a essentially,
I mean,

1302
01:14:37,151 --> 01:14:41,410
I compare my life to probably
that of pioneers a long time ago,

1303
01:14:41,411 --> 01:14:45,040
that those were the guys that wrote
the stories that people read. You know,

1304
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:49,360
they wanted to hear about real
adventure. And it's like, I mean,

1305
01:14:49,361 --> 01:14:52,630
I tell people out there, I mean it's,
when you're out there, it's legit. I mean,

1306
01:14:53,290 --> 01:14:55,540
I've been in a lot of
life or death situations.

1307
01:14:55,541 --> 01:14:59,770
I've seen a lot of things
that people will never seen.

1308
01:14:59,771 --> 01:15:03,130
I've been places where I bet
very few humans have ever been.

1309
01:15:03,490 --> 01:15:07,060
What is the most extreme life or death
situation you think you've ever been in?

1310
01:15:07,480 --> 01:15:10,450
One that stands out and so
mad and um, yeah, I mean,

1311
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:12,490
from a very early age,

1312
01:15:12,491 --> 01:15:16,690
I've run into a few that I was struck
by lightning when I was a kid. Yeah,

1313
01:15:16,691 --> 01:15:21,580
that was, that was interesting. Um,
maybe that's your deal, man. That's it.

1314
01:15:21,581 --> 01:15:22,414
Dude.

1315
01:15:25,160 --> 01:15:28,760
You got struck by lightening. Fuck.
How old were you? I was, I was like,

1316
01:15:28,761 --> 01:15:32,000
it was before kindergarten is just like,
it's like my first memory, you know,

1317
01:15:32,001 --> 01:15:36,130
just a little kid were, and this wasn't
even, I wasn't even out anywhere.

1318
01:15:36,131 --> 01:15:40,390
It's just backyard with my
dad looking over the city.

1319
01:15:40,870 --> 01:15:44,920
We just got done putting up a
basketball hoop. Boom Fried.

1320
01:15:45,550 --> 01:15:49,780
Whoa. So it was the basketball hoop
itself that attracted the electricity,

1321
01:15:49,810 --> 01:15:53,340
but it was like, yeah, it was over
a mile away was the clowns and a,

1322
01:15:53,350 --> 01:15:55,750
they call it like bolts over the blue.
It just,

1323
01:15:56,690 --> 01:15:59,320
those lightning bolts can go up to a
mile away from there, their center.

1324
01:15:59,321 --> 01:16:02,860
And it was one of those massive,
like in Nevada lightening is,

1325
01:16:02,920 --> 01:16:05,320
it just happened because there's so
many independent mountain ranges.

1326
01:16:05,321 --> 01:16:10,000
As clouds move creates positive, negative
energy and then they're super powerful.

1327
01:16:11,620 --> 01:16:14,480
I mean, it was, uh, you know, it was a
crazy experience, but I was, you know,

1328
01:16:14,500 --> 01:16:18,880
I was pretty young. Um, I remember it.
My Dad might mean my dad both got struck.

1329
01:16:18,881 --> 01:16:23,800
My Dad was paralyzed for almost a month,
just like nerves grew back.

1330
01:16:23,801 --> 01:16:28,530
You know, Holy Shit, your dad
was paralyzed for about, yeah.

1331
01:16:28,540 --> 01:16:30,880
Maybe, maybe a few weeks, three
weeks, something like that.

1332
01:16:30,881 --> 01:16:34,840
And then just like neck down. I know
from the waist down. Yeah. Oh my,

1333
01:16:35,290 --> 01:16:39,880
he got hit above the waist and the
doctor said that he wouldn't be alive,

1334
01:16:39,881 --> 01:16:43,150
but he was, he was, he was like, he's,
you know, an athlete too. I mean,

1335
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:45,700
I think a lot of the vo two
Max comes from my jeans.

1336
01:16:45,701 --> 01:16:49,020
I've got like on both sides of the family,
just super athletes and uh,

1337
01:16:49,090 --> 01:16:53,810
my dad run every day and his heart
can handle that burst. I was, uh,

1338
01:16:53,830 --> 01:16:56,800
I got struck below. I got struck in
my right leg right above the knee,

1339
01:16:56,860 --> 01:16:59,380
came out right below the knee lift
like a pencil sized bruise all the way

1340
01:16:59,381 --> 01:17:03,010
through my leg. And uh, you know,

1341
01:17:03,011 --> 01:17:07,330
I mean I, I woke up, I didn't
really know what was going on.

1342
01:17:07,331 --> 01:17:09,740
It's Kinda like people ask,
I remember it pretty well.

1343
01:17:09,741 --> 01:17:11,930
And when the movie saving
private Ryan came out,

1344
01:17:11,931 --> 01:17:14,960
when that bomb goes off right next
to the guy, you know, and it's like,

1345
01:17:14,961 --> 01:17:18,560
everything's like quiet but weird.
It was exactly like that.

1346
01:17:18,980 --> 01:17:22,790
I think like anybody that's kind of
had some kind of shell shock like that,

1347
01:17:22,820 --> 01:17:26,510
that clip and that movie is so realistic.

1348
01:17:26,900 --> 01:17:30,410
Like the dude that made that clip had
to have experienced that, you know,

1349
01:17:30,750 --> 01:17:35,120
it's so loud, you can't hear anything.
You're like, everything's confusing.

1350
01:17:35,450 --> 01:17:37,480
I mean,
you're like watching the rain phone,

1351
01:17:37,481 --> 01:17:40,700
slow motion because your heart's going
so fast. All he feels your heart,

1352
01:17:40,730 --> 01:17:44,150
you're like watching rain, like,
like lands on your skin, explodes,

1353
01:17:44,151 --> 01:17:45,890
lands on your skin to expose.
People are talking to you,

1354
01:17:45,891 --> 01:17:48,050
but it's like they talked to
you three seconds ago, you know,

1355
01:17:48,051 --> 01:17:50,780
like a three second delay kind
of thing and you're like, ah,

1356
01:17:50,781 --> 01:17:54,140
I don't know what's going
on. Then blackout again. Wow.

1357
01:17:54,540 --> 01:17:59,030
And so what was the physical repercussions
for you? For me, I've, you know, I,

1358
01:17:59,060 --> 01:18:01,640
I remained pretty unscathed.

1359
01:18:01,641 --> 01:18:05,300
I had a twitch for until
I was about 17 you know?

1360
01:18:08,580 --> 01:18:10,730
So what does it look like?

1361
01:18:10,731 --> 01:18:15,710
What did that switch thing pretty
much gave just broken record.

1362
01:18:15,770 --> 01:18:18,980
Yeah, it's wild years of my
life. I would twitch man.

1363
01:18:18,981 --> 01:18:22,970
And it was like I was the kid at school
that had the twitch, but it'd be like,

1364
01:18:23,390 --> 01:18:26,210
that kid got hit by lightning, you know,
he's like, that's why he's got the twitch.

1365
01:18:26,240 --> 01:18:29,150
So what would you do? Like give me an
example of the two. I was like, um,

1366
01:18:30,140 --> 01:18:33,920
I don't know. Not that bad, but
like I can't, I can't even do it.

1367
01:18:33,950 --> 01:18:36,050
Maybe if I do it on my insight,
some muscle memory,

1368
01:18:37,160 --> 01:18:41,810
it's like never there now does it?
Um, not really. I mean, you know,

1369
01:18:41,811 --> 01:18:45,850
like you feel it a little bit and you're
like, no, no mental control and no.

1370
01:18:45,860 --> 01:18:50,330
So you feel it coming on and you could
give in. It's like a CS. Yeah. I mean,

1371
01:18:50,331 --> 01:18:51,560
I haven't felt it for a long time.

1372
01:18:51,561 --> 01:18:54,800
Like I think I've been over the hump long
enough where it just doesn't come back.

1373
01:18:55,910 --> 01:19:00,140
That's an incredible 12 years of
twitching. That's, uh, yeah, that,

1374
01:19:00,170 --> 01:19:03,220
that was a pretty harrowing
experience as a child. But, um,

1375
01:19:03,500 --> 01:19:08,390
in my recent years I had a,
a pretty crazy experience.

1376
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:11,120
Uh, it's almost like kind
of hard to talk about.

1377
01:19:11,121 --> 01:19:14,840
It's just one of those
like weird deals. But, um,

1378
01:19:15,560 --> 01:19:19,640
I was, uh, I was in
Montana. I've got like a,

1379
01:19:19,730 --> 01:19:24,180
I'm an outfitter and that's how I make my
living is taking people on expeditions,

1380
01:19:24,181 --> 01:19:28,430
hunting or whatever, all over the world.
And A, I've got a lodge based in Montana.

1381
01:19:28,431 --> 01:19:30,680
And so we're building this,
um,

1382
01:19:31,910 --> 01:19:34,850
this outdoor shower bathroom thing.

1383
01:19:34,851 --> 01:19:37,070
Cause we do this big 4th of
July party every year, right?

1384
01:19:37,730 --> 01:19:42,320
And so my place is right on the river
and it's springtime and it's one of the

1385
01:19:42,321 --> 01:19:45,140
highest runoffs we've ever had.
Um,

1386
01:19:46,070 --> 01:19:51,070
so the water is a all spring runoff and
they measure rivers in cubic feet per

1387
01:19:51,501 --> 01:19:52,334
second.

1388
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:57,080
So the river normally would say
is like 300 cfs this weekend.

1389
01:19:57,110 --> 01:20:01,910
It was flowing, it 3000 cfs. So
that's like the same size river,

1390
01:20:01,911 --> 01:20:03,350
but that much water.
I mean,

1391
01:20:03,351 --> 01:20:06,740
he's just ripping and it's that kind of
water where you put your hand in it and

1392
01:20:06,741 --> 01:20:10,650
it's ice cold. Like, I mean
a lot like that glacial river
that, that Steve crossed.

1393
01:20:11,220 --> 01:20:12,053
And,
uh,

1394
01:20:13,140 --> 01:20:17,520
so I'm out there building the thing
and my family's helping me. And, uh,

1395
01:20:17,790 --> 01:20:21,470
had been Raf's going by kind of a little
bit throughout the day cause it's a

1396
01:20:21,470 --> 01:20:26,280
really nice day is father's day. And I
hear somebody yell, I was thinking, okay.

1397
01:20:26,970 --> 01:20:29,970
So I walked to the edge of the river
and I see all the ship floating down.

1398
01:20:30,090 --> 01:20:34,890
I'm thinking this is not good. You know,
somebody must've turned their boat.

1399
01:20:35,490 --> 01:20:36,180
And uh,

1400
01:20:36,180 --> 01:20:41,180
here comes his lady floating face up
and she just locks eyes with me and she

1401
01:20:41,581 --> 01:20:44,370
says, help me, help me.
I'm going to go shit my,

1402
01:20:44,430 --> 01:20:47,670
by this time my mom had run up to the
river too and I take my cell phone and my

1403
01:20:47,671 --> 01:20:51,450
wallet on my pocket. I throw it to my
mom and I yell to her, call nine one one,

1404
01:20:51,480 --> 01:20:55,770
you know, and the lady, I yell
twice, I kicked the shore, you know,

1405
01:20:55,830 --> 01:20:58,920
and I'm to, and she's just like
looking at me, help me, help me.

1406
01:20:58,921 --> 01:21:01,830
And she's floating down the
river pretty quick. Well,

1407
01:21:01,831 --> 01:21:05,810
she hits a current and takes off, you
know, in the background. My mom screaming,

1408
01:21:05,820 --> 01:21:07,890
don't go in the river,
don't go in the river.

1409
01:21:08,310 --> 01:21:12,240
And she hits the current
and eyes just start running.

1410
01:21:12,241 --> 01:21:15,620
And to this day I do not remember,
like I,

1411
01:21:15,720 --> 01:21:19,740
I've walked through that area a lot of
times. I don't know how I ran so fast,

1412
01:21:19,741 --> 01:21:23,370
like I don't remember like in when it
was all over, I don't remember running.

1413
01:21:23,700 --> 01:21:27,030
I just remember being at the end of,
there's like this,

1414
01:21:27,150 --> 01:21:30,900
I mean trees and shit falling everywhere
and I don't know how I ran through it

1415
01:21:30,901 --> 01:21:31,734
so fast,

1416
01:21:31,740 --> 01:21:34,650
but I ended up hitting the highway and
running down the highway and there's this

1417
01:21:34,651 --> 01:21:38,220
corner where the river banks and there's
a big cliff on one side and then it

1418
01:21:38,221 --> 01:21:39,690
makes us giant rapid there.

1419
01:21:40,170 --> 01:21:45,170
Well I see her and she goes under the
rapid and at this point I hit the highway

1420
01:21:45,361 --> 01:21:50,070
and this truck had pulled off
and I, um, I yelled to the guy,

1421
01:21:50,071 --> 01:21:53,790
I say, uh, she pops up and she's
coming close to the shore now.

1422
01:21:54,120 --> 01:21:56,640
And I yelled to this guy who's
standing there. I say, grabber,

1423
01:21:56,660 --> 01:22:00,000
cause you just popped up. Well,
he reaches out and he was like,

1424
01:22:00,090 --> 01:22:04,530
I don't know if he freaked out or what,
like he grabs and you just misses her.

1425
01:22:04,880 --> 01:22:06,780
And at this point I'm like,
Oh shit. You know what I mean?

1426
01:22:06,870 --> 01:22:09,600
She was just alive and uh,
she's,

1427
01:22:09,780 --> 01:22:13,820
she's hitting the faster water
again and I just jumped in and uh,

1428
01:22:14,040 --> 01:22:18,240
so I jumped in and I,
I'm in the river with her and you know,

1429
01:22:18,241 --> 01:22:21,510
like my thought when I jumped in
was I'm not getting out of this.

1430
01:22:21,540 --> 01:22:23,880
It was like the weirdest,
weirdest deal ever.

1431
01:22:24,180 --> 01:22:28,170
So I jumped in and I grabbed her foot when
I grabbed her foot, she goes under, um,

1432
01:22:28,171 --> 01:22:32,100
so I kind of have to scoop her up under
the water and I start floating down the

1433
01:22:32,101 --> 01:22:36,660
river with her,
holding her up and I catch the rocks.

1434
01:22:36,690 --> 01:22:40,920
And, um, I just, luckily I was wearing my
hunting boots that day. They were like,

1435
01:22:41,010 --> 01:22:43,200
you know, tall hunting
boots, like nine inch boots.

1436
01:22:43,520 --> 01:22:47,010
And I think that's the only reason I
got out of the river because it made my

1437
01:22:47,011 --> 01:22:50,820
ankle is stiff enough. I could
catch the rocks on the bottom and a,

1438
01:22:50,821 --> 01:22:54,090
and then I drug her up on shore and
I, I tried not to move or, you know,

1439
01:22:54,091 --> 01:22:56,910
cause I didn't know if she
had a broken neck or what. Um,

1440
01:22:56,970 --> 01:23:00,690
so I get her up to the shore
and I, um, I check, you know,

1441
01:23:01,470 --> 01:23:06,310
first responder, you know, so I
do all this stuff and uh, I um,

1442
01:23:07,090 --> 01:23:09,450
check and make sure she's breathing
or whatever. There's like,

1443
01:23:09,460 --> 01:23:10,960
not really any signs of life,

1444
01:23:10,961 --> 01:23:15,310
but her eyes are open and she's got
a little bit of breath, tiny pulse.

1445
01:23:15,610 --> 01:23:17,860
So I just kind of like look at it.
It's like you're looking at her,

1446
01:23:17,861 --> 01:23:19,520
but nobody's home now. I'm, so,

1447
01:23:19,521 --> 01:23:22,390
I just grabbed her by the face and y'all
look at me, look at me, look at me.

1448
01:23:22,391 --> 01:23:25,810
And about after 10 times of yelling
it, it's like all of a sudden, boom,

1449
01:23:25,811 --> 01:23:30,370
someone comes to, she takes a
breath and was like, okay. Um,

1450
01:23:30,540 --> 01:23:33,700
I tell the other guy, go grab some
blankets and stuff, wrap her up.

1451
01:23:34,690 --> 01:23:39,100
And she looks at me and she says,
where's Dave? Where's Dave? I'm like,

1452
01:23:40,870 --> 01:23:45,700
you know, I don't know who's Dave,
you know, I mean by this time,

1453
01:23:45,701 --> 01:23:50,590
a lot of times past, I turn around and
on the bottom of the rivers, this guy,

1454
01:23:50,620 --> 01:23:54,040
all his clothes are ripped off and he's
going down the river head first on the

1455
01:23:54,041 --> 01:23:58,630
opposite side of the river. I
go, shit is dead dead. You know,

1456
01:23:58,631 --> 01:24:02,860
he'd been five minutes behind or maybe,
and uh, so at this point it's like,

1457
01:24:03,280 --> 01:24:06,040
you know, I just like, I didn't
really, you know, I mean,

1458
01:24:06,041 --> 01:24:09,730
here's an able body person that
was completely screwed, you know,

1459
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:13,870
like in the river, completely screwed.
You know, what's the mean that I like,

1460
01:24:14,050 --> 01:24:17,500
I have no special skillset that they
don't have to get myself out of this,

1461
01:24:17,501 --> 01:24:21,370
you know, just maybe a little bit of
luck. Um, you know, I went in for her,

1462
01:24:21,371 --> 01:24:24,190
but you know, I mean, I
obviously knew this guy was gone,

1463
01:24:24,580 --> 01:24:27,750
so I threw something like that floated
over top of them because everything kind

1464
01:24:27,751 --> 01:24:31,420
of floats at a constant rate and we ended
up pulling him out of the rear two and

1465
01:24:31,421 --> 01:24:36,340
a half miles down. Um, he
had died. And obviously, um,

1466
01:24:36,850 --> 01:24:40,330
which, you know, it's like, it's
a really horrible experience.

1467
01:24:40,930 --> 01:24:44,500
The lady called me back the
next, the next day, you know,

1468
01:24:44,501 --> 01:24:48,880
cause she just lost her husband. It was
father's Day. And, uh, yeah, I mean,

1469
01:24:48,881 --> 01:24:51,130
it's like, it's, you're like,
okay. And then, you know,

1470
01:24:51,131 --> 01:24:52,630
you're going through all
these weird emotions.

1471
01:24:52,631 --> 01:24:56,560
Like I just jumped into river and like,
didn't think I was coming out of it.

1472
01:24:56,590 --> 01:24:59,590
And like the emotional shit
that you go through, you know,

1473
01:24:59,591 --> 01:25:03,190
it's like really a weird deal. And
then a, so she called and said,

1474
01:25:03,191 --> 01:25:06,310
I just want to hear your story. And then
I wanted to tell you my story, you know,

1475
01:25:06,340 --> 01:25:10,480
because it's like a, you just like, I
feel this connection with this lady now,

1476
01:25:10,481 --> 01:25:11,780
you know? And, uh,

1477
01:25:11,790 --> 01:25:14,710
so she tells me her story and she said
they were floating down the river.

1478
01:25:15,010 --> 01:25:16,240
They hit this back.
Eti,

1479
01:25:16,690 --> 01:25:20,170
the raft got s there was a log that
fell across the river and Raf get sucked

1480
01:25:20,171 --> 01:25:24,880
under the, the log and spits them
both up, you know, out, you know,

1481
01:25:24,881 --> 01:25:26,500
everything's gone.
They're floating down the river.

1482
01:25:27,070 --> 01:25:29,590
They weren't wearing life vests. And, uh,

1483
01:25:30,110 --> 01:25:34,510
they're holding hands floating down
the river. He says, I love you,

1484
01:25:34,540 --> 01:25:37,500
and then just disappears,
manage, and that,

1485
01:25:38,500 --> 01:25:40,540
so she says,
she tells me,

1486
01:25:40,541 --> 01:25:44,260
and it must have been at some point
after I saw her when she went under the

1487
01:25:44,261 --> 01:25:48,520
water. She said that, um, it was the
most peaceful feeling she'd ever felt.

1488
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,070
She said it was like everything was white.

1489
01:25:51,370 --> 01:25:56,170
She says she knows her husband didn't
suffer. She's like, it was like she,

1490
01:25:56,171 --> 01:26:01,171
and then she heard this voice like
way off in the distance and a,

1491
01:26:01,211 --> 01:26:04,280
and just like latched
onto it and then came to,

1492
01:26:04,730 --> 01:26:05,630
and so the doctors,

1493
01:26:05,690 --> 01:26:08,990
the doctors told her that even
five more seconds in the water,

1494
01:26:08,991 --> 01:26:09,681
she would have been dead.

1495
01:26:09,681 --> 01:26:13,370
Her body had completely given up
and they said that it was like,

1496
01:26:13,400 --> 01:26:16,490
it was like this weird response. I just
started yelling at her. I don't know why.

1497
01:26:16,790 --> 01:26:18,350
Like I just,
it was like,

1498
01:26:18,380 --> 01:26:23,150
it felt like the right thing to do
and they said like that, that voice,

1499
01:26:23,210 --> 01:26:27,590
like gave her something to latch onto and
like let her body know that it's okay.

1500
01:26:27,700 --> 01:26:31,000
Like, you know, it was really weird. Wow.

1501
01:26:31,930 --> 01:26:34,420
Oh Shit. Yeah. That's crazy.

1502
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:39,860
Yeah, that is a, that's what your risk,
when you go rafting, right. It's the,

1503
01:26:39,890 --> 01:26:43,610
these people deciding they
were professionals too. I
mean, this, this guy is,

1504
01:26:43,800 --> 01:26:47,370
they were, this is what they did for a
living. They were professionals. Wow.

1505
01:26:47,400 --> 01:26:50,880
You're just like, so they weren't just
tourists? No, they weren't tourists.

1506
01:26:50,881 --> 01:26:54,860
They were, they were scouting it out
before they took clients there. Oh my God.

1507
01:26:54,861 --> 01:26:59,430
Yeah. Rivers a fuck you this. You
know what I mean? You just like,

1508
01:26:59,670 --> 01:27:00,960
it's kind of like any professional,

1509
01:27:00,961 --> 01:27:05,010
you get into a certain mindset
where you'd call, you get,

1510
01:27:05,040 --> 01:27:08,580
you get too comfortable and like I, I've
been guilty of it, you know? I mean,

1511
01:27:08,581 --> 01:27:10,530
we all have in some,
some respects, you know,

1512
01:27:10,531 --> 01:27:14,130
it's like you ever take a motorcycle down
the street without a helmet, you know,

1513
01:27:14,131 --> 01:27:17,080
or what you know, just, just think
you can get away with it. Yeah.

1514
01:27:17,190 --> 01:27:19,320
Did we let them in Montana life vest?
No,

1515
01:27:19,321 --> 01:27:22,150
but the water was fucking six inches
deep. We kept bottoming out. Yeah.

1516
01:27:22,460 --> 01:27:23,970
Did that water was not killing me.

1517
01:27:24,090 --> 01:27:26,940
If I fell in that water I was getting
to the shore. That wasn't that fast.

1518
01:27:26,941 --> 01:27:30,210
It wasn't that dangerous. It wasn't
that spooky. That didn't bother me.

1519
01:27:30,211 --> 01:27:33,300
But if we were encountering some rapids,
I would've definitely wanted one.

1520
01:27:33,810 --> 01:27:36,660
But that was the water was,
it would've sucked if we fell in.

1521
01:27:36,661 --> 01:27:39,870
But most of it was like waist height.
Yeah. You know, it would have been fine,

1522
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:44,750
but if we were in some like
serious, I would have been
shitting my pants on. Yeah.

1523
01:27:45,090 --> 01:27:48,120
I don't really like water and
me don't really mix sometimes.

1524
01:27:48,121 --> 01:27:50,250
And that's why I was like crossing
the thing with Steve. It's like

1525
01:27:50,290 --> 01:27:54,790
no shit, this looks a little
hairy. Brought up bad memories.

1526
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:58,000
I'm not comfortable in water either.
My scariest a wilderness thing.

1527
01:27:58,020 --> 01:28:00,400
It was in the ocean with sharks.
Like I've been charged by bears.

1528
01:28:00,401 --> 01:28:02,200
We've had that Moose.
I've had all kinds of shit happen.

1529
01:28:02,360 --> 01:28:05,310
You been charged by bears
will on the unmetered. Oh,

1530
01:28:05,320 --> 01:28:07,720
let the Caribou one with Tim
Ferriss. Is that one? Oh No,

1531
01:28:07,721 --> 01:28:12,190
we got charged this last fall. That's
fucking, no. Yeah, you'll hear it.

1532
01:28:12,191 --> 01:28:15,190
You'll hear about a Friday with Steve
for sure. But yeah, we got charged.

1533
01:28:15,191 --> 01:28:18,070
We got by a mom, Gris and
three cubs. That's right.

1534
01:28:18,071 --> 01:28:20,890
You guys told me about that in Wisconsin.
She tracked us down and charge,

1535
01:28:21,400 --> 01:28:24,430
tracked you down and
show she fucking Christ.

1536
01:28:24,880 --> 01:28:29,080
But last year I was in Mexico with my
brother's spear fishing and had two bull

1537
01:28:29,081 --> 01:28:31,780
sharks come after us. Very
briefly. We spirit some fish.

1538
01:28:31,780 --> 01:28:35,440
The fish were about five feet away
coming in. These two monsters.

1539
01:28:35,441 --> 01:28:39,640
Fucking sharks come out of the depths and
just like coming right at me and there

1540
01:28:39,641 --> 01:28:42,490
was no,
there was no reaction because a,

1541
01:28:42,491 --> 01:28:46,570
I'm not comfortable underwater be,
what the fuck are you going to do?

1542
01:28:46,750 --> 01:28:49,630
I was like 15 feet on.
I was like on a dive.

1543
01:28:49,631 --> 01:28:52,330
It was just kind of like
suspended and it was,

1544
01:28:52,420 --> 01:28:57,220
it was just the most
completely, everything's
stopped actually with the bears,

1545
01:28:57,221 --> 01:28:58,150
everything's stopped too,

1546
01:28:58,151 --> 01:29:01,980
but I felt like I still had some
sort of control and control,

1547
01:29:01,981 --> 01:29:06,150
but with the sharks, it's just like a
bunch of armed people on the ground.

1548
01:29:06,151 --> 01:29:08,310
When the bear rushed,
everyone would had rifles.

1549
01:29:08,430 --> 01:29:11,300
But you know what's interesting
is that didn't bring any piece.

1550
01:29:11,800 --> 01:29:15,180
It's just like this extra thing that
happens is sort of extra sensory thing.

1551
01:29:15,181 --> 01:29:20,181
I think where it's that blissful moment
of nothing and it's happened a few times

1552
01:29:21,991 --> 01:29:23,970
in the woods when like
shit really goes down.

1553
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:27,270
The shark was a little different
because it wasn't enjoyable.

1554
01:29:27,300 --> 01:29:32,300
The bear was somehow enjoyable situation
way previous where a kid went into Anna

1555
01:29:35,250 --> 01:29:37,380
Filactic shock.
I used to lead trips for teens,

1556
01:29:37,381 --> 01:29:41,790
basically fucked up teens
in the wilderness and had
one time a kid went to Anna

1557
01:29:41,790 --> 01:29:45,150
Filactic shock and couldn't breathe.
I like threw him over my shoulder,

1558
01:29:45,151 --> 01:29:48,060
carried him through the desert
of ways jasmine with an Epi pen.

1559
01:29:48,480 --> 01:29:51,540
And I remember coming out of that
experience just kind of like you said,

1560
01:29:51,541 --> 01:29:52,550
the sort of uh,

1561
01:29:53,580 --> 01:29:56,250
you just go into this sort of weird
connection with what's happening.

1562
01:29:56,251 --> 01:29:59,580
But she also like how you couldn't
remember how you ran to that thing.

1563
01:29:59,581 --> 01:30:01,320
I can't remember what
happened for two minutes,

1564
01:30:01,650 --> 01:30:06,650
but I brought this kid back like revived
him and that feeling of nothing is

1565
01:30:08,431 --> 01:30:11,220
something I've sort of been chasing sense,

1566
01:30:11,250 --> 01:30:15,810
which is just like this pure
action without thought, dislike,

1567
01:30:15,840 --> 01:30:19,140
beautiful, slow motion,
almost nothingness.

1568
01:30:19,380 --> 01:30:24,210
And yet everything is happening so fucking
quickly. It's amazing. But the sharks,

1569
01:30:24,211 --> 01:30:26,040
that didn't happen,
that was just shitting my pants

1570
01:30:26,810 --> 01:30:29,690
thing because in such an
extreme situation you're,

1571
01:30:29,691 --> 01:30:34,250
you're almost forced to abandon all
your extra thinking and all your

1572
01:30:34,550 --> 01:30:38,150
contemplation, worry, this, that
and the other thing. And it becomes,

1573
01:30:38,151 --> 01:30:43,151
you're just a pure organism trying to
exist and stay existing and you're rotting

1574
01:30:44,010 --> 01:30:47,150
100% on an instinct and a bear
is looking at, yeah, it's a peak.

1575
01:30:47,151 --> 01:30:50,270
It's just reacting perfectly.
Peak experience, man.

1576
01:30:50,570 --> 01:30:51,590
Do you think people get addicted?

1577
01:30:51,610 --> 01:30:55,220
Did that you'd look into it?
Fuck yeah, I don't think so.

1578
01:30:55,280 --> 01:31:00,230
I think on a light level, like I'll put
myself around it maybe, but no I don't,

1579
01:31:00,290 --> 01:31:01,730
you know,
I don't need to jump off shit.

1580
01:31:01,731 --> 01:31:03,620
I don't need to climb
the highest mountains.

1581
01:31:03,621 --> 01:31:07,730
But like the animal stuff and getting
that close like that is something that I

1582
01:31:07,731 --> 01:31:11,630
really, really fucking day and I haven't
come common with Ramey and Steve.

1583
01:31:11,631 --> 01:31:15,200
It's just like that
experience to me is priceless.

1584
01:31:15,790 --> 01:31:20,220
I'll tell you one thing that was
a really unusual to me about um,

1585
01:31:20,710 --> 01:31:24,970
going into Montana and a hunting,
well when I, when I killed that deer,

1586
01:31:25,240 --> 01:31:29,800
it was, this is what the unexpected
aspect of it. It was almost psychedelic.

1587
01:31:30,250 --> 01:31:33,250
It's almost like you're
in this weird world,

1588
01:31:33,251 --> 01:31:37,480
it's not your world and there's a being
in there that exists there all the time

1589
01:31:37,720 --> 01:31:39,360
and then all of a sudden you're,
your day.

1590
01:31:39,400 --> 01:31:42,880
It's almost like an illusion
or a or hallucination.

1591
01:31:43,030 --> 01:31:47,080
It's very strange when you're in their
world and you pluck one of them out of

1592
01:31:47,081 --> 01:31:49,780
there and drag it away and it's like,
what did we just

1593
01:31:51,680 --> 01:31:52,630
piled the animal?

1594
01:31:52,740 --> 01:31:55,960
There's a huge connection in cultures
between hunters and psychedelics and like

1595
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:57,900
the journeys you take on a,
on psychedelics.

1596
01:31:57,901 --> 01:32:01,490
I think there's a clear
connection between it. I,

1597
01:32:01,570 --> 01:32:04,120
I'm just agreeing with you that,
that the hunting experience,

1598
01:32:04,121 --> 01:32:09,121
that sort of intensity or that sort of
connection with the natural state is so

1599
01:32:09,520 --> 01:32:13,060
not what we're in every day here.
That you come away from it different.

1600
01:32:13,370 --> 01:32:14,450
Well,
that's one of the things I,

1601
01:32:14,510 --> 01:32:19,510
I'm endlessly thankful to you guys about
is that experience in Montana because

1602
01:32:19,880 --> 01:32:24,110
the, what you guys picked wasn't like
Wisconsin where when we were in Wisconsin,

1603
01:32:24,111 --> 01:32:24,801
there was a road,

1604
01:32:24,801 --> 01:32:27,500
there was only a mile away and there
was a house and it was like, you know,

1605
01:32:27,501 --> 01:32:31,400
it was a farm. It's, it's, it's, it's
sort of wild. Yeah. But not really.

1606
01:32:31,401 --> 01:32:34,820
It's a bunch of weird animals and hanging
around the farm that you can eat their

1607
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:36,800
farm animals kind of,
but you got to shoot him,

1608
01:32:37,120 --> 01:32:41,890
you know? I thank you for that moment
where you finished off that deer.

1609
01:32:42,020 --> 01:32:45,190
Yeah. I think you brought to our show,
I think you brought to like the public,

1610
01:32:45,550 --> 01:32:50,550
the most sort of poignant moment of
what it means to take a life and to kill

1611
01:32:50,621 --> 01:32:54,700
something in the wild. Like they didn't
like your face when you kill that animal.

1612
01:32:55,900 --> 01:32:59,260
You look at it, you're frozen
and then you breathe out heavily.

1613
01:32:59,680 --> 01:33:04,390
That is yet you told the story we've
been trying to tell and have been telling

1614
01:33:04,391 --> 01:33:06,190
over and over perfectly.

1615
01:33:06,710 --> 01:33:11,060
Wow. Well, you know, it was just a
hundred percent the raw experience.

1616
01:33:11,240 --> 01:33:12,490
And uh,

1617
01:33:12,590 --> 01:33:17,270
what I was going to say is I thank you
guys for introducing me to such a wild

1618
01:33:17,271 --> 01:33:21,320
adventure. It was completely wa no
cell phones. There was no internet,

1619
01:33:21,350 --> 01:33:24,350
there was no humans. We, what did we
see? We were there for how many days?

1620
01:33:24,351 --> 01:33:28,390
Five days did we see five
people, maybe, maybe three,

1621
01:33:28,391 --> 01:33:32,510
three people on boats that were going
down the same river. It was their world.

1622
01:33:32,540 --> 01:33:36,350
And we just sort of found our
way into their world. And uh,

1623
01:33:37,140 --> 01:33:40,470
just it was very psychedelic.
Very, very much so.

1624
01:33:40,710 --> 01:33:42,960
It's a totally a trip to go
into the wilderness like that.

1625
01:33:43,290 --> 01:33:47,430
And I sold my career before I was in TV
is I took people into wilderness for the

1626
01:33:47,431 --> 01:33:49,950
first time. That's what I did.
And you frame it the same way.

1627
01:33:50,050 --> 01:33:50,890
Well tell his story though,

1628
01:33:50,891 --> 01:33:53,800
because it wasn't just that you
actually did it with troubled kids,

1629
01:33:53,801 --> 01:33:55,990
which I found really fascinating.

1630
01:33:56,250 --> 01:33:58,620
Yeah. I did that for about
five years out of college.

1631
01:33:58,650 --> 01:34:02,910
I both for private pay companies where
families were just unhappy with how their

1632
01:34:02,911 --> 01:34:07,410
teams were acting and then also for state
correctional facilities so that those

1633
01:34:07,411 --> 01:34:09,840
are the ones that had the most fun
and probably where the state ones,

1634
01:34:09,841 --> 01:34:14,841
so every 21 days I'd go down around to
Minnesota is different juvenile detention

1635
01:34:15,301 --> 01:34:15,631
centers,

1636
01:34:15,631 --> 01:34:20,631
pickup 10 kids from the hood and drive
mode to the Wilderness for 21 days and do

1637
01:34:20,881 --> 01:34:22,530
these big in this.

1638
01:34:22,560 --> 01:34:25,740
In the winter we would do cross
country ski treks in the summer.

1639
01:34:25,741 --> 01:34:29,580
We'd can do in the shoulder seasons,
we would hike and it was just the,

1640
01:34:30,450 --> 01:34:34,020
just the most bad ass way to spend
my time. I did that for a long time

1641
01:34:34,130 --> 01:34:37,760
and you had a good success and kind of
getting to these kids because of that,

1642
01:34:37,770 --> 01:34:40,970
a Yankee in the amount of their world
and putting him something completely

1643
01:34:40,971 --> 01:34:42,530
different. Yeah. Giving them this,

1644
01:34:42,800 --> 01:34:46,930
this alternative perspective of being
in the wild that just sorta like makes

1645
01:34:46,931 --> 01:34:49,160
them like, what is the life I'm
living is the life I'm living?

1646
01:34:49,161 --> 01:34:52,250
Just something I'm used to and this is
not the only option and just a lot of

1647
01:34:52,251 --> 01:34:53,084
weirdness out there.

1648
01:34:53,680 --> 01:34:57,040
Absolutely.
They always left with something valuable.

1649
01:34:57,080 --> 01:35:00,290
They always left with something that
they would look at and look at things in

1650
01:35:00,291 --> 01:35:02,590
their normal life differently.
Did it pull,

1651
01:35:02,810 --> 01:35:06,830
pull all the kids away from
their habits and shit? No,

1652
01:35:07,610 --> 01:35:09,890
but was it a worthwhile
thing? Fuck yeah. You know,

1653
01:35:09,891 --> 01:35:13,010
as an alternative to staying in,
in prison or in jail.

1654
01:35:13,280 --> 01:35:17,450
It's like the alternative sentence to my
21 day program was maybe six weeks in a

1655
01:35:17,451 --> 01:35:20,060
juvenile detention center.
Fuck that.

1656
01:35:20,150 --> 01:35:23,630
You know like come out in the
woods and learn how to do shit.

1657
01:35:23,660 --> 01:35:27,590
Be responsible for yourself, be treated
respectfully, learn about nature.

1658
01:35:27,630 --> 01:35:31,460
Get some fresh air, like getting
shaped. Like that's, that's good.

1659
01:35:31,940 --> 01:35:35,600
No matter 21 days to like even if
you're in a crew or whatever, man,

1660
01:35:35,900 --> 01:35:38,180
if you don't have the modern conveniences,

1661
01:35:38,570 --> 01:35:43,570
the importance of self reliance is like
you can teach yourself so you're your

1662
01:35:43,641 --> 01:35:45,320
best teacher man.
You know?

1663
01:35:45,360 --> 01:35:49,970
I mean the idea of giving these kids
some kind of self reliance where they are

1664
01:35:49,971 --> 01:35:54,770
in charge of themselves in this situation
and they have to use their brains and

1665
01:35:54,771 --> 01:35:57,440
their whatever and pay attention and like,

1666
01:35:57,500 --> 01:35:59,810
I don't see how that could be beneficial.

1667
01:35:59,990 --> 01:36:02,240
Yeah. How it could not be. Yeah. I,

1668
01:36:02,270 --> 01:36:05,330
I've found it just beneficial
just to be away from people,

1669
01:36:05,420 --> 01:36:08,510
just to be away from the city,
just to be away from cars.

1670
01:36:08,820 --> 01:36:13,430
There's to be away from planes flying
overhead. It's not natural. That's not,

1671
01:36:13,431 --> 01:36:17,740
our bodies are accustomed to after
hundreds of thousands of years. Yeah.

1672
01:36:18,380 --> 01:36:21,020
It's weird. The air's different.
Everything's different.

1673
01:36:21,021 --> 01:36:24,740
You feel different when
you're not inundated with
radio signals and TV signals

1674
01:36:24,741 --> 01:36:28,370
and Wifi. It sounds like horse
shit. But if field that the fucking,

1675
01:36:29,470 --> 01:36:31,960
the quiet feels different out there.
It's a different quiet.

1676
01:36:31,990 --> 01:36:34,330
It's are displaying to people
that haven't experienced it too.

1677
01:36:34,331 --> 01:36:34,781
You know what I mean?

1678
01:36:34,781 --> 01:36:37,450
It's one of those things like if
you don't know when you got to,

1679
01:36:37,810 --> 01:36:39,400
you can't really explain it.
You can say it,

1680
01:36:39,401 --> 01:36:41,770
but you know you don't really
get it until you've done it,

1681
01:36:41,830 --> 01:36:44,260
which is why it feels like psychedelics.
It's kind of the same type of thing.

1682
01:36:44,410 --> 01:36:46,390
Once you've, once you've done
it, then you can talk about it,

1683
01:36:46,391 --> 01:36:48,700
but if you're talking to somebody who
hasn't done it, then it's sort of a,

1684
01:36:49,020 --> 01:36:51,970
it's just a different way of
experiencing things and you can share it,

1685
01:36:51,971 --> 01:36:53,020
which is what's really cool.

1686
01:36:53,021 --> 01:36:55,870
It's fun to share with you and Brian and
fun to share with all the people I've

1687
01:36:55,871 --> 01:37:00,460
taken out in the woods is that
that forms a bond, you know,

1688
01:37:00,520 --> 01:37:04,210
the very quickly,
in a very strong way.

1689
01:37:04,630 --> 01:37:08,220
I mean our wolf pack on the apex show,
just the hunting shows, you know,

1690
01:37:08,230 --> 01:37:09,040
it's different.

1691
01:37:09,040 --> 01:37:13,120
Something about that affects
your relationships with
the people you're out there

1692
01:37:13,121 --> 01:37:13,954
with.

1693
01:37:14,020 --> 01:37:17,560
It's good for 100% I think anytime you've
gone through something with someone

1694
01:37:17,561 --> 01:37:21,250
that's like really intense, it's
just your bond, your connection,

1695
01:37:21,251 --> 01:37:24,700
your understanding of each other.
And the world that you live in is very,

1696
01:37:24,790 --> 01:37:26,070
very unique.
Yeah.

1697
01:37:26,620 --> 01:37:30,520
There's something specific about dudes
I think that need that or crave that.

1698
01:37:30,790 --> 01:37:33,220
I worked with young
men mostly pretty much,

1699
01:37:34,090 --> 01:37:38,680
probably 95% and I think that's a huge
thing lacking in our culture is just that,

1700
01:37:39,160 --> 01:37:42,100
just that experience and then it's,
it's, it's, I think it's what we need.

1701
01:37:42,340 --> 01:37:44,340
We need to do that well. It's
certainly a part of it, of

1702
01:37:44,340 --> 01:37:48,960
who we used to be and I think tapping
into that a lot of times can give people a

1703
01:37:48,961 --> 01:37:52,680
sense of satisfaction that this doesn't
exist in the modern manufactured world

1704
01:37:52,681 --> 01:37:54,990
that we live in of
cubicles and nine to fives,

1705
01:37:55,080 --> 01:37:59,520
alarm clocks and all the nonsense that
we've come to accept as being life.

1706
01:37:59,820 --> 01:38:03,900
But it's not in fact your
body or your DNA itself,

1707
01:38:03,901 --> 01:38:08,901
the epigenetics that shaped you as an
individual are all based on ancestors that

1708
01:38:09,421 --> 01:38:12,330
never went through anything even remotely
close to what we're going through.

1709
01:38:12,660 --> 01:38:16,650
And when you do the stuff that
they used to do, you feel great.

1710
01:38:16,980 --> 01:38:18,990
That was happy people.
That was what it was all about.

1711
01:38:18,991 --> 01:38:22,000
Werner Herzog's documentary.
It's about these guys there.

1712
01:38:22,060 --> 01:38:24,390
There's no mental illness.
No one's depressed.

1713
01:38:24,391 --> 01:38:28,350
They're having a great fucking time.
All they do is hunt and fish and trap.

1714
01:38:28,380 --> 01:38:33,060
That's it. That's their whole life.
And we think that they're fucked up.

1715
01:38:33,180 --> 01:38:36,630
But meanwhile they live as long as
us and they die just like we die.

1716
01:38:36,631 --> 01:38:38,430
But they're happy.
The fucking hole tires

1717
01:38:38,440 --> 01:38:42,050
and can we think they're losers? They
live with an ease that you can't. Yeah,

1718
01:38:42,051 --> 01:38:45,320
I spent a lot of time like in the jungle
in South American and other places with

1719
01:38:45,321 --> 01:38:46,490
indigenous people.

1720
01:38:46,700 --> 01:38:50,210
There is an ease with which they go
through their day with which they talk to

1721
01:38:50,211 --> 01:38:54,950
each other with which they eat their
food, which is just like, it's, you know,

1722
01:38:54,951 --> 01:38:58,430
I went there pretty young to South
American side. I was like, Holy Shit,

1723
01:38:58,460 --> 01:39:01,250
I want that. I want to be around that.
I want to see what the fuck that is.

1724
01:39:01,280 --> 01:39:04,250
I want to like, you know, spend
some time and just see what,

1725
01:39:04,490 --> 01:39:08,120
cause it's different man.
It's just like we have this like up tight.

1726
01:39:08,180 --> 01:39:12,860
Even the most relaxed of us here in
America have this sort of uptight thing.

1727
01:39:13,340 --> 01:39:14,820
I got it fucking,
yeah,

1728
01:39:15,110 --> 01:39:18,260
it seems like a lot of people are
just worried about uncertainty or,

1729
01:39:18,500 --> 01:39:20,870
and then they get in these patterns
because it's, it's certain,

1730
01:39:20,900 --> 01:39:24,230
you know what I mean? It's
like, uh, what's going to
happen with the stock market?

1731
01:39:24,231 --> 01:39:26,990
What's going to happen with my 401k?
So they'd be getting these,

1732
01:39:26,991 --> 01:39:31,630
like we're such a pattern of all species.
I mean, like I've, I've seen, you know,

1733
01:39:31,640 --> 01:39:34,850
I've been to a lot of countries, I spent
a lot of time just like in the bush,

1734
01:39:34,880 --> 01:39:38,870
just watching animals in certain animals
have patterns because it's comfortable.

1735
01:39:38,871 --> 01:39:40,850
It's like predictable,
you know what I mean?

1736
01:39:41,140 --> 01:39:45,290
And there's no more pattern we'll
species than humans. I mean, we just,

1737
01:39:45,320 --> 01:39:49,070
we are like clockwork. You don't have,
because we don't like that uncertainty.

1738
01:39:49,400 --> 01:39:49,911
And then,
you know,

1739
01:39:49,911 --> 01:39:54,320
you throw yourself in a situation
where every day it's uncertain.

1740
01:39:54,321 --> 01:39:58,620
It's whatever. It's different.
And it's just like, it's,

1741
01:39:58,880 --> 01:40:01,990
you get out of that, you're happy,
you feel good. You know, like I,

1742
01:40:01,991 --> 01:40:06,500
I've been doing the solo hunter show
and that a lot of that comes out of my

1743
01:40:06,501 --> 01:40:10,400
thing has always been just,
it started out as,

1744
01:40:10,401 --> 01:40:12,110
I didn't have anybody to go hunting with,

1745
01:40:12,350 --> 01:40:15,770
so I would just go out in the
woods by myself. You know,

1746
01:40:15,771 --> 01:40:20,450
I think my longest trip was almost a month
just in the wild along. And it's like,

1747
01:40:20,930 --> 01:40:25,350
there's like, where'd you go?
Nevada wilderness. Wow. Yeah.

1748
01:40:25,390 --> 01:40:29,630
I think like Nevada I think is the
most untouched place in the lower 48

1749
01:40:29,760 --> 01:40:33,450
[inaudible] circus circus. I was, um,

1750
01:40:33,560 --> 01:40:35,870
on the Vegas strip between the palms.

1751
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:41,390
I ate some ass cops left
behind hunting for 30 days,

1752
01:40:42,320 --> 01:40:46,130
but um, you know, I mean it was like
just short of a month. And uh, you know,

1753
01:40:46,131 --> 01:40:49,280
I think in that it was like a lot
of uncertainty, a lot of, you know,

1754
01:40:49,310 --> 01:40:53,090
everything was unpredictable,
but you're 100% relying on yourself,

1755
01:40:54,100 --> 01:40:58,210
which is just like this great. You're
happy, you know? But I think the other,

1756
01:40:58,240 --> 01:41:02,350
the other thing about it too is a lot of
people don't like being alone and it's

1757
01:41:02,351 --> 01:41:03,350
just,
I don't know if it did,

1758
01:41:03,351 --> 01:41:06,160
you just don't like yourself or you just
aren't familiar with yourself. You know,

1759
01:41:06,460 --> 01:41:07,293
I think people are

1760
01:41:07,490 --> 01:41:10,820
running away from a lot of the
issues that they have in their life.

1761
01:41:10,821 --> 01:41:14,520
And one of the ways that people run away
just by keeping themselves busy or keep

1762
01:41:14,530 --> 01:41:15,840
themselves distracted.
Yeah.

1763
01:41:15,890 --> 01:41:18,800
So I think some people just don't like
being alone because then they're like,

1764
01:41:18,801 --> 01:41:22,310
okay well here I am and oh maybe we
should just fucking think about who we are

1765
01:41:22,311 --> 01:41:24,650
here while we're sitting here.
It doesn't take long.

1766
01:41:24,651 --> 01:41:29,120
And you have like me turns out I
think I'm kind of a fucking idiot.

1767
01:41:30,980 --> 01:41:35,900
It's also the forest reevaluation of the
momentum that your life has taken on,

1768
01:41:35,901 --> 01:41:39,140
which is also uncomfortable because
it doesn't seem like he can stop it.

1769
01:41:39,141 --> 01:41:40,600
And it's also,
you know,

1770
01:41:40,610 --> 01:41:44,690
it's so much of who you are and it's why
so many people that live like terrible

1771
01:41:44,691 --> 01:41:48,950
lives defending, embrace that life. Cause
they don't want to admit they fucked up.

1772
01:41:49,280 --> 01:41:52,100
They don't want to admit that they've
probably been living their life on the

1773
01:41:52,101 --> 01:41:56,000
momentum of this like really shitty
decision that they made when they were 18

1774
01:41:56,450 --> 01:42:00,650
let's pick their college major or
whatever, whatever it was. You know?

1775
01:42:00,651 --> 01:42:03,350
And I like what you said
about the patterns too,

1776
01:42:03,351 --> 01:42:07,640
because that eliminating a lot of the
fear and uncertainty is a lot of what

1777
01:42:07,641 --> 01:42:10,430
people do. And it's a lot of why
people get good jobs. They all,

1778
01:42:10,431 --> 01:42:12,660
I'm just going to get a good
job that pays good. He's got it.

1779
01:42:12,710 --> 01:42:14,810
I got dental and you know,
and then who,

1780
01:42:14,811 --> 01:42:17,540
I don't have to worry about that
anymore and, but in doing that,

1781
01:42:17,630 --> 01:42:21,350
you kill all the fucking wild,
crazy fun of life.

1782
01:42:21,820 --> 01:42:26,050
You don't have those experiences, man.
You eliminate experience from life.

1783
01:42:26,340 --> 01:42:29,220
I wouldn't recommend you jumping
in the river and saving people,

1784
01:42:29,221 --> 01:42:32,850
but I think you jumped in the river and
saving that woman probably elevated you

1785
01:42:32,851 --> 01:42:33,684
as a human

1786
01:42:33,860 --> 01:42:37,130
fuck. Yeah. I mean it changed it
that day changed my life, you know?

1787
01:42:37,250 --> 01:42:40,910
I couldn't imagine it not, you just look
at everything different. You're like,

1788
01:42:40,940 --> 01:42:45,460
okay, it that given point. I
mean, it was almost like if I did,

1789
01:42:45,940 --> 01:42:48,560
it was a weird feeling, man.
It's like thing like, um,

1790
01:42:49,220 --> 01:42:52,430
I guess I don't care if I live or
die almost. But you do, you know,

1791
01:42:52,700 --> 01:42:55,460
it's like it's a weird feeling and then
so you live here the rest of the day.

1792
01:42:55,461 --> 01:42:58,520
He's like, man, cause I think I
made it out of that river. You know,

1793
01:42:58,880 --> 01:43:03,620
I'm going to really do something cool
this year. That's part of the addiction,

1794
01:43:03,680 --> 01:43:06,890
the addiction to that thing. So in that
moment when the bear is charging you,

1795
01:43:06,980 --> 01:43:11,360
it's that uncertainty, the idea of
uncertainty, but it's so fucking narrow.

1796
01:43:11,361 --> 01:43:14,230
It's like compressed into
this perfect moment. Like you,

1797
01:43:14,290 --> 01:43:19,070
you are going to die or you're not going
to die and you're not certain of it,

1798
01:43:19,071 --> 01:43:23,730
but it's so fucking acute. The
apps get that I think. Yeah,

1799
01:43:24,590 --> 01:43:29,120
I can imagine. You know, I mean if
somebody's shooting at you, he's like,

1800
01:43:29,121 --> 01:43:30,410
I'm going to work every day,

1801
01:43:30,411 --> 01:43:32,780
but are they really just going
to work or you know what I mean?

1802
01:43:32,781 --> 01:43:36,920
That kind of job where you're in the
line of of uncertainty and danger.

1803
01:43:37,110 --> 01:43:41,320
Yeah. I had a friend who was a cop when
I lived in Boston and he was in, um,

1804
01:43:41,690 --> 01:43:45,780
a fairly safe area, but he was
getting transferred and, uh,

1805
01:43:45,810 --> 01:43:48,660
he asked to get transferred to
a bad neighborhood. And I go,

1806
01:43:48,661 --> 01:43:53,090
why are you doing that? And he goes, more
action and I go, more action. He goes,

1807
01:43:53,100 --> 01:43:56,630
yeah. He goes, I'm a, you
know, I'm bored. I go, see,

1808
01:43:56,631 --> 01:44:00,560
you want to go with a crime as he goes,
that's why I'm a cop. I'm like, well,

1809
01:44:00,561 --> 01:44:05,060
you're, you should be a cop.
That he got the right mindset.

1810
01:44:05,390 --> 01:44:09,910
But he would talk very similarly about it,
about that he appreciates it,

1811
01:44:10,010 --> 01:44:14,240
appreciates the good aspects of his
life because of the bad aspects of the

1812
01:44:14,241 --> 01:44:15,230
things that he sees every day.

1813
01:44:15,510 --> 01:44:16,343
Yeah.

1814
01:44:16,690 --> 01:44:20,020
Cause the thrill and the danger
of, you know, not, you know,

1815
01:44:20,260 --> 01:44:23,110
you fucking kicked down a door and
you know, you're locked and loaded.

1816
01:44:23,111 --> 01:44:25,660
Who knows what the fuck is gonna
happen, you know, who knows?

1817
01:44:25,661 --> 01:44:28,670
Who knows what's going to happen when you
get out of that and you're okay. Whew.

1818
01:44:28,690 --> 01:44:29,220
That fucking,
yeah.

1819
01:44:29,220 --> 01:44:32,710
Lemonade taste sweeter. Yeah. It's
like you get this adrenaline rush man.

1820
01:44:33,090 --> 01:44:35,150
You know what I mean?
I've had a lot of other experiences.

1821
01:44:35,151 --> 01:44:37,080
Maybe not as extreme as that,
but you know,

1822
01:44:37,081 --> 01:44:41,400
a lot of other experiences in every time.
It's like that rush of adrenaline.

1823
01:44:41,401 --> 01:44:44,940
It's like, okay, well,
hey, I survived unscathed.

1824
01:44:45,310 --> 01:44:49,800
Like checking your body pretty unscathed.
Right on. Let's do this again guys.

1825
01:44:49,801 --> 01:44:54,720
You know. Well, we made it.
We're fine with one more time.

1826
01:44:54,721 --> 01:44:57,830
Maybe one more time around, but
what about wild animals? What's the,

1827
01:44:57,831 --> 01:45:01,950
the creepiest wild animal encounter
you've ever had? Uh, you know,

1828
01:45:02,310 --> 01:45:03,620
I had a bear,
um,

1829
01:45:04,410 --> 01:45:08,370
I was guiding this one guy in
New Mexico and I parked this,

1830
01:45:08,610 --> 01:45:13,610
I bought this brand new four wheeler and
parked it and we do this hike and for

1831
01:45:14,221 --> 01:45:17,520
sitting there like looking for
elk and I hear something by me,

1832
01:45:17,521 --> 01:45:19,290
I kind of like turn around
and look behind my shoulder.

1833
01:45:19,530 --> 01:45:22,770
Here's this bear standing off
force like right there. Okay.

1834
01:45:23,250 --> 01:45:27,840
So how far were 10 feet brown bear,
black, black bear, black bear,

1835
01:45:29,370 --> 01:45:33,270
black bears. Like, I'm not really afraid
of bears. It's not like something that I,

1836
01:45:33,271 --> 01:45:36,300
you know, I mean, I like it when I'm in
grizzly country. I like pay attention,

1837
01:45:36,360 --> 01:45:40,200
you know, but it's not like something
that keeps me awake at night. Um,

1838
01:45:40,410 --> 01:45:44,700
but you know, this bear kind of
comes around and like, okay, this is,

1839
01:45:44,970 --> 01:45:46,830
you know what I mean? His clothes,
he's like kind of inquisitive.

1840
01:45:47,800 --> 01:45:50,280
And the guy that's with me, he's like, you
have a bear tag, right? I was like, yeah,

1841
01:45:50,281 --> 01:45:53,850
he's like shooting. I was like, ah,
I'm not going to shoot this bear. Um,

1842
01:45:53,880 --> 01:45:56,360
but I was like, if it does something,
you know, shoot it, you know, it's like,

1843
01:45:56,940 --> 01:46:00,300
take my pistol out of my holster and
I'm standing on this rock and the bear

1844
01:46:00,301 --> 01:46:04,590
looks up and I like stick gun out. And
he like just looks at me like, okay.

1845
01:46:05,220 --> 01:46:09,000
And then walks off. It was
like, oh, that's pretty cool.

1846
01:46:09,420 --> 01:46:11,190
It's the guy hands me his rifle.
And he was like,

1847
01:46:11,191 --> 01:46:13,350
just in case it comes back and he's like,
do you want it to come back? He's like,

1848
01:46:13,410 --> 01:46:15,840
no, I don't know. So I make
this dying rabbit and I was like

1849
01:46:19,130 --> 01:46:20,920
charging it.
You know

1850
01:46:24,860 --> 01:46:27,240
there's a bear comes
charging in and throw the

1851
01:46:27,280 --> 01:46:30,940
gun up and as soon as they throw the gun
up, the bear wheels around, it goes off.

1852
01:46:31,170 --> 01:46:32,003
All right.
That was cool.

1853
01:46:32,260 --> 01:46:37,260
So we go back and hike up to the
four wheeler and I look and the bear,

1854
01:46:38,201 --> 01:46:42,040
what had done is it got into this dude's
pack and he left his pack on the four

1855
01:46:42,041 --> 01:46:46,060
wheeler toward the pack up and then
followed our tracks down to us looking for

1856
01:46:46,061 --> 01:46:50,060
food, you know, so I'm laughing at him
like, ah, you're packed, got ripped

1857
01:46:50,060 --> 01:46:52,230
off. I told you not to leave
it there. You need a idiot.

1858
01:46:52,560 --> 01:46:55,860
And he's kind of getting pissed like that.
I'm thinking this is funny.

1859
01:46:55,861 --> 01:46:57,300
And I get to my brand new four wheeler,

1860
01:46:57,490 --> 01:47:00,870
the bear toward the seed in half
and it was clawing and ripped.

1861
01:47:00,871 --> 01:47:04,710
It ripped so much that it tore the
key out four wheeler and stuff.

1862
01:47:04,711 --> 01:47:08,010
We couldn't find the four wheeler
key. And we ended up just, I mean,

1863
01:47:08,080 --> 01:47:12,780
we were like on our hands and knees with
flashlights where this damn key a long

1864
01:47:12,781 --> 01:47:15,400
ways away from where we started
and ended up finding the key.

1865
01:47:15,401 --> 01:47:19,590
But when I lived in Colorado,
a bear got into this lady's car,

1866
01:47:19,680 --> 01:47:24,420
opened up the door of her car and ate
her car. I mean the fucking eight.

1867
01:47:24,570 --> 01:47:27,240
They have pictures of it on the
website. They love, love their website.

1868
01:47:27,480 --> 01:47:29,980
They ate well. It wasn't even
leather. I think it was final. Really.

1869
01:47:30,160 --> 01:47:33,480
The bear ate the fucking dashboard.
The bear ate the dashboard.

1870
01:47:33,481 --> 01:47:37,200
Bear ate the seats to everything.
Just so mangled.

1871
01:47:37,201 --> 01:47:40,500
The inside of the car and new car,
they like that new car smell

1872
01:47:42,380 --> 01:47:42,931
like shit.

1873
01:47:42,931 --> 01:47:46,470
I had a buddy who was like a back
country ranger in the boundary waters

1874
01:47:46,471 --> 01:47:49,020
wilderness and Minnesota,
big ass million Acre wilderness.

1875
01:47:49,320 --> 01:47:52,680
There's latrines and all the campsites
and he'd have to go around and fix the

1876
01:47:52,681 --> 01:47:55,890
trains. Like every spring
after the shit came on frozen,

1877
01:47:56,280 --> 01:48:00,630
the bears would fucking crawl down in
there and eating human feces and all the

1878
01:48:00,631 --> 01:48:04,750
toilet in the blue water,
natural,

1879
01:48:04,760 --> 01:48:07,380
no blue water that they're just
like natural shit and water.

1880
01:48:07,440 --> 01:48:11,160
The bears would eat the shit black bears.
Jesus Christ.

1881
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:13,440
It seems that they,
if they,

1882
01:48:13,470 --> 01:48:16,620
that's a weird thing too about watching
hunting shows is that if bears are

1883
01:48:16,621 --> 01:48:18,760
eating the right thing,
they're delicious. Yeah.

1884
01:48:18,870 --> 01:48:22,140
But if they're eating the wrong thing,
they're nasty. You are what you eat.

1885
01:48:23,100 --> 01:48:27,540
Literally. Literally when you
a, when you catch a bear and a,

1886
01:48:27,541 --> 01:48:30,060
or if you shoot a bear rather,
and the bear's been eating blueberries,

1887
01:48:30,090 --> 01:48:33,800
that's the most delicious. Oh, that's
what I've been told. It's fantastic.

1888
01:48:33,880 --> 01:48:36,980
Blueberry bear. It's fantastic. You
actually cut it open. You got the burger,

1889
01:48:36,981 --> 01:48:38,760
you can smell it.
You can see it in the blood.

1890
01:48:38,761 --> 01:48:41,610
You can see it in the fussy and the
fat. The fats blue, right? Dark.

1891
01:48:41,611 --> 01:48:43,320
It smells like it, Huh? Wow.

1892
01:48:43,340 --> 01:48:46,380
And it's delicious flesh of the
animal changes the color of the flesh.

1893
01:48:46,381 --> 01:48:49,470
The animal,
I guess I can't say conclusively.

1894
01:48:49,471 --> 01:48:51,810
I'd want to see another bear next to it.
And it didn't have it.

1895
01:48:51,840 --> 01:48:55,170
Maybe it's somewhat in our heads, but
certainly the fat. Absolutely. Yeah.

1896
01:48:55,171 --> 01:48:58,530
It looked like it looked like it was,
I would watch that one episode in Alaska.

1897
01:48:58,530 --> 01:48:59,363
Is that where you guys were?

1898
01:48:59,730 --> 01:49:03,000
And one we've done one in British Columbia
than it was feeding on blueberries

1899
01:49:03,001 --> 01:49:07,260
and one Alaska to wow. There are some
amazing animals out there though.

1900
01:49:07,440 --> 01:49:12,420
I saw a Golden Eagle go after,
um, some big horn sheep,

1901
01:49:12,620 --> 01:49:16,200
like swooping on dear size,
like the babies, you know.

1902
01:49:16,470 --> 01:49:20,970
And then I've also seen him knock a,
a mountain goat off a cliff.

1903
01:49:21,300 --> 01:49:26,250
You saw it like that was in
Montana. They this, so it, this one,

1904
01:49:26,251 --> 01:49:28,890
it didn't kill it, but what they'll
do is like, it knocked it off,

1905
01:49:28,891 --> 01:49:32,970
but then it got its feet and was okay.
But um, what they'll do is they'll, like,

1906
01:49:33,180 --> 01:49:34,350
they're the number one predators.

1907
01:49:34,351 --> 01:49:37,110
These mountain goes and they'll just grab
them on the back, hug him off a cliff,

1908
01:49:38,220 --> 01:49:42,210
they go down and eat them. It's
like, holy cow, that's an episode.

1909
01:49:43,250 --> 01:49:46,560
I've seen that it's made to do it.
The hang gliding. Yeah. Look at it.

1910
01:49:46,561 --> 01:49:48,040
Here it goes right here.
Look at this. There

1911
01:49:48,040 --> 01:49:51,850
you go. Look at this. Yeah, I've seen
that. Oh, that sounds a Himalayan.

1912
01:49:52,060 --> 01:49:56,020
Everything that is so gangster.
Look at it.

1913
01:49:56,050 --> 01:50:00,430
It just pulled it off the mountain
and just bash it against the rocks.

1914
01:50:00,940 --> 01:50:05,710
It's insane. I so crazy
this year. That out too.

1915
01:50:05,830 --> 01:50:06,670
They're so big.

1916
01:50:06,730 --> 01:50:10,780
That's kind of like a tool that's like
almost like as intelligent as using tools.

1917
01:50:11,010 --> 01:50:15,520
Yeah. You Birds Amaze me man. Like
Ravens. Have you seen this video?

1918
01:50:15,610 --> 01:50:19,030
There's these ravens that we'll figure
it out to drop nuts in front of like

1919
01:50:19,090 --> 01:50:22,360
traffic and then they go down when the
lights change and pick them up so the

1920
01:50:22,361 --> 01:50:24,640
cars break the nuts. Yeah, it's crazy.

1921
01:50:24,641 --> 01:50:27,180
We're seeing the one where the
raven figures out the use of tools,

1922
01:50:27,200 --> 01:50:28,840
not just as a primary tool,

1923
01:50:28,841 --> 01:50:33,340
but a secondary tool that you use a a
secondary tool to get the primary tool and

1924
01:50:33,341 --> 01:50:37,570
then use the primary tool to get meat out
of a, out of a puzzle. Really? Oh my God.

1925
01:50:37,810 --> 01:50:42,580
Pull it up. Oh, I got to savings. Raven's
solve complex puzzle. See if you can,

1926
01:50:42,581 --> 01:50:44,380
uh,
find it because it's,

1927
01:50:44,470 --> 01:50:49,470
it's one of those things that
shock the scientists when they,

1928
01:50:50,021 --> 01:50:52,330
uh, when they put it on, when
they put the experiment on,

1929
01:50:52,370 --> 01:50:55,960
you couldn't believe how fast these
ravens could figure it out. I mean,

1930
01:50:55,961 --> 01:51:00,940
it was unbelievable. Well, that's,
come on, let me see what I can find it.

1931
01:51:01,490 --> 01:51:02,323
Sorry.
Yep.

1932
01:51:02,860 --> 01:51:03,200
Yeah.

1933
01:51:03,200 --> 01:51:07,630
Let's say
yes,

1934
01:51:07,631 --> 01:51:09,940
this is one of them.
This is one of several.

1935
01:51:10,090 --> 01:51:13,210
So what they figured out is they
get this stick, look at this,

1936
01:51:13,480 --> 01:51:18,090
and they use the stick to get a
second stick. Yeah. They use it.

1937
01:51:18,340 --> 01:51:19,173
They figured out,

1938
01:51:19,690 --> 01:51:23,590
they figured it out instantly and then
they use that and now they get the second

1939
01:51:23,591 --> 01:51:25,000
sticks.
So he's got the second step.

1940
01:51:25,030 --> 01:51:27,520
Now use the second stick
to get something else.

1941
01:51:28,900 --> 01:51:29,180
Okay.

1942
01:51:29,180 --> 01:51:30,800
Hello.
Look who tried to get a third step.

1943
01:51:31,450 --> 01:51:31,630
Okay.

1944
01:51:31,630 --> 01:51:34,360
I mean, it's fucking mind
blowing, man. Look at that.

1945
01:51:34,361 --> 01:51:39,361
And he's got a third stick and then she
uses the third stick to get whatever the

1946
01:51:39,551 --> 01:51:40,540
fuck she was trying to get.

1947
01:51:41,290 --> 01:51:41,700
Okay.

1948
01:51:41,700 --> 01:51:45,660
She's trying to get some food. That's
awesome. And if she can't figure that out,

1949
01:51:45,720 --> 01:51:48,930
then she'll go and try a
fourth and a fifth dick. Look
at that. She got her food.

1950
01:51:49,350 --> 01:51:53,510
That's nuts man. And they figured
it out within seconds. I know.

1951
01:51:53,740 --> 01:51:56,380
I don't even think most people
would figure that out. Oh,
I would start with that.

1952
01:51:57,110 --> 01:52:01,540
I would start with that. Just fucking
ravens. Sneaky bastard. I had a steak, uh,

1953
01:52:01,560 --> 01:52:03,420
that was frozen and I was
trying to thought out,

1954
01:52:03,421 --> 01:52:06,750
so I said maybe we better if I put out
in the sun and I put it out in the sun in

1955
01:52:06,751 --> 01:52:10,830
my backyard for 30 seconds. And I came
back in a raven was eating it just gone.

1956
01:52:11,010 --> 01:52:12,490
I was like, no, he didn't eat all day,

1957
01:52:12,491 --> 01:52:16,080
but he picked like some pieces out of the
steak and I was like, you creepy prick.

1958
01:52:16,080 --> 01:52:18,590
Like you're spying on
me like you're watching.

1959
01:52:18,750 --> 01:52:21,720
He realized that I came out and
I put that stake down. It's like,

1960
01:52:21,750 --> 01:52:25,350
oh look at this stupid fuck you went
in the house. Woo. Like immediate,

1961
01:52:25,351 --> 01:52:28,260
like he's probably peering,
watching from the trees,

1962
01:52:28,261 --> 01:52:30,360
thinking about what I'm doing.
Like leave this dopey bitch.

1963
01:52:30,430 --> 01:52:32,190
Probably fallen you in your car every day.

1964
01:52:33,570 --> 01:52:36,630
I keep telling the story about an
octopus that I need to figure out if it's

1965
01:52:36,720 --> 01:52:39,540
legit and true or not,
but it's supposedly,

1966
01:52:39,541 --> 01:52:42,930
it was in a scientific laboratory and one
side of the room there was a tank with

1967
01:52:42,931 --> 01:52:46,040
octopus in it. The other side of the
room was a tank with fish in it. The

1968
01:52:46,100 --> 01:52:48,620
more things have lids on
them. Yeah. Octopus at night,

1969
01:52:48,680 --> 01:52:51,610
the fish kept disappearing and then like
what the fuck happened there? So the,

1970
01:52:51,670 --> 01:52:54,940
the octopus would take the lid off the
tank, crawl out, crawl across room,

1971
01:52:54,950 --> 01:52:58,280
take the lid off the other tank, grab a
fish, put the lid back on, crawl back,

1972
01:52:58,310 --> 01:52:59,143
put their own lid on.

1973
01:52:59,260 --> 01:53:02,470
Yes. Yeah. That was real. That is
real. It's amazing video. Yeah.

1974
01:53:02,830 --> 01:53:05,830
I don't know if there's a
video, there's a video. Well,

1975
01:53:05,831 --> 01:53:08,380
there's definitely a video of
octopus is climbing out. Look,

1976
01:53:08,410 --> 01:53:09,260
there's one right there.

1977
01:53:09,490 --> 01:53:14,490
An octopus walking on the
ground or crawling or whatever
the fuck you would call

1978
01:53:14,531 --> 01:53:17,620
that squirming on the ground and
they can move across the wall.

1979
01:53:18,040 --> 01:53:20,050
Do they have predators?
Anything? Kill Octopus,

1980
01:53:20,140 --> 01:53:24,490
you must kill sharks.
That's what's fucked up.

1981
01:53:24,491 --> 01:53:26,980
There was another video that
they took from an aquarium,

1982
01:53:27,010 --> 01:53:29,400
from a large aquarium and a,

1983
01:53:29,410 --> 01:53:32,590
they were trying to figure out why these
sharks were missing like what the fuck

1984
01:53:32,591 --> 01:53:33,400
is going on.

1985
01:53:33,400 --> 01:53:37,480
So they set up a camera and they were
worried when they introduced sharks that

1986
01:53:37,481 --> 01:53:41,320
the octopus who'd become food for the
sharks, but it's totally the opposite.

1987
01:53:41,590 --> 01:53:45,490
The sharks are swimming along and the
octopus looking at this out of nowhere,

1988
01:53:45,610 --> 01:53:50,380
leaps on this shark and
just fucking Jackson, look,
here's his shock. Like, well,

1989
01:53:50,381 --> 01:53:52,360
I'm the Buddha's
motherfucker in this tech.

1990
01:53:52,610 --> 01:53:57,130
Where do you is going to do both that
and this thing that looks like a rock is

1991
01:53:57,131 --> 01:54:01,300
just sitting there waiting
for his opportunity to fuck
up a shark and it's the

1992
01:54:01,301 --> 01:54:05,140
shark. It's too close. It leaps out
in nowhere and grabs a hold of him.

1993
01:54:05,141 --> 01:54:09,070
Check this out, swap us, get over here.

1994
01:54:09,850 --> 01:54:13,220
Wraps him up. Wow. Makes them
useless and just starts eat.

1995
01:54:13,620 --> 01:54:16,050
Yeah. Once those, I think once
shark, they have to keep moving.

1996
01:54:16,051 --> 01:54:17,640
Sharks always have to be swimming.
You know,

1997
01:54:17,920 --> 01:54:20,580
that occupancy just turns them upside
down and puts him in a submission hold

1998
01:54:20,581 --> 01:54:21,600
that sharks done.
Okay.

1999
01:54:21,780 --> 01:54:25,470
Isn't it an interesting how nature
balances itself out? It's like, yeah,

2000
01:54:25,471 --> 01:54:28,320
it makes it so sharks are awesome
and they have big giant teeth,

2001
01:54:28,321 --> 01:54:32,040
but let's throw a little monkey wrench
in and he can't sleep and you have to

2002
01:54:32,041 --> 01:54:36,480
keep moving. And if you pause, you die.
How about that is, you know, like people,

2003
01:54:36,540 --> 01:54:40,830
okay, you're going to be figuring
out cars and guns and all that,

2004
01:54:40,831 --> 01:54:44,480
but let's make your skin so that like
you could kinda pinch away through it.

2005
01:54:45,510 --> 01:54:48,660
You pulled parts out and that just
you bleed out and you just die

2006
01:54:49,070 --> 01:54:53,720
real easy. I have this, uh, this
unique experience this year I was out,

2007
01:54:53,790 --> 01:54:56,870
um, we were just looking
around and I see this,

2008
01:54:57,290 --> 01:55:00,860
these bear tracks in the
snow. So I'm like, okay.

2009
01:55:01,740 --> 01:55:04,480
So I'm actually out there just taking
pictures of these bear tracks as they,

2010
01:55:04,700 --> 01:55:09,250
they frozen in the ice. So it was like
a really cool look and track and uh,

2011
01:55:09,450 --> 01:55:12,920
I'm just like on road and,
but he's with me and he's like,

2012
01:55:13,400 --> 01:55:17,390
I get in the truck and he's like, there's
the bear. And I look up and you know,

2013
01:55:17,391 --> 01:55:21,050
cause I've been looking at, and it's
like 30, 40 feet away from the truck.

2014
01:55:21,470 --> 01:55:23,330
So I'm like, yeah, okay.

2015
01:55:23,570 --> 01:55:27,800
And it's like I've never seen like bears
always run away most like never seen a

2016
01:55:27,801 --> 01:55:30,200
bear tooth and walks off below the road.
I'm like,

2017
01:55:30,201 --> 01:55:32,390
there's something weird with this bear.
Right?

2018
01:55:33,050 --> 01:55:35,900
So we get out of the truck and I
look and it's like below the road,

2019
01:55:36,290 --> 01:55:40,070
so I sneak up and just start petting the
bear on the ass and my buddy's filming

2020
01:55:40,071 --> 01:55:43,570
it with his iPhone. Right. Whereas
I'm petting this, I've got,

2021
01:55:43,680 --> 01:55:47,130
I've got to get it from him, so I'm
petting this live bear. All right.

2022
01:55:47,190 --> 01:55:49,830
And just like, I'm just like, hey bear.
And just like talking to this bear.

2023
01:55:50,660 --> 01:55:52,380
But that story in your pocket.
I know,

2024
01:55:52,650 --> 01:55:57,650
well this happened this year and so I'm
petting this bear and then bear looks

2025
01:55:57,721 --> 01:56:01,810
back at me and he's like looking
at me and I'm like, there's like,

2026
01:56:01,860 --> 01:56:03,870
I thought it was like needed or something.

2027
01:56:03,871 --> 01:56:06,420
I'm not really sure what's going on
with this bear. His eyes are red,

2028
01:56:06,720 --> 01:56:11,700
the bears blind, she's blind
bear. He's like, never seen that.

2029
01:56:12,030 --> 01:56:16,050
So the bear like, it's like having trouble
moving around and we're thinking like,

2030
01:56:17,250 --> 01:56:20,040
I don't know, is this bear
been shot? Or like whatever.

2031
01:56:20,340 --> 01:56:23,190
So they were watching this bear and
I'm videoing it and the bear walks up,

2032
01:56:23,830 --> 01:56:27,060
he hits his head on a tree, walks into
circle, hits his head on the tree again.

2033
01:56:27,390 --> 01:56:31,460
100% blind. Yeah. So we're like these,

2034
01:56:31,490 --> 01:56:35,850
these two other guys that were with me
and both of them are vets and they're

2035
01:56:35,851 --> 01:56:40,380
like freaking out like, oh that bear
suffering. You know, what can we do?

2036
01:56:40,770 --> 01:56:44,700
You know? And it's like, as humans,
we, we feel sorry for things, you know,

2037
01:56:44,701 --> 01:56:45,990
we feel sorry for him,
but you know,

2038
01:56:45,991 --> 01:56:48,180
like looking at it like that Barry
didn't feel sorry for itself.

2039
01:56:48,181 --> 01:56:52,290
Is it just in nature? It was an old
bear and uh, you know, it's just,

2040
01:56:52,350 --> 01:56:53,940
that's what happens in bears get old.

2041
01:56:53,941 --> 01:56:57,660
They go blind and they starved to
death and die, you know. But I mean,

2042
01:56:57,661 --> 01:57:02,661
it was like crazy to see how this bear
was just like at the end it was probably

2043
01:57:04,021 --> 01:57:08,160
a 30 year old bear. Did you watch
the last episode of mediator?

2044
01:57:08,850 --> 01:57:13,740
Which, um, last Thursday, what was
it? Spring Bear? Just one where,

2045
01:57:13,741 --> 01:57:15,290
um, no, I didn't see that one.

2046
01:57:15,320 --> 01:57:19,130
Steve went bear hunting and
have a lock on a barren.

2047
01:57:19,180 --> 01:57:23,100
Just decided he didn't want to shoot
it and I just decided, uh, you know,

2048
01:57:23,101 --> 01:57:26,760
he did it twice. Two Times in the
episode is like, you know what, I don't,

2049
01:57:27,560 --> 01:57:30,690
I don't need to shoot this bear. Well,
here's the thing, people like that,

2050
01:57:30,691 --> 01:57:35,640
don't hunt. Don't get it necessarily.
Like, I love animals. You know,

2051
01:57:35,670 --> 01:57:38,460
it's like I,
it's almost hard to,

2052
01:57:38,461 --> 01:57:42,000
for me to believe how someone else that
doesn't spend as much time in nature

2053
01:57:42,300 --> 01:57:45,180
loves animals like I do because
I'm around them all the time.

2054
01:57:45,181 --> 01:57:47,790
I don't want to see these animals
disappears. Like people think, oh,

2055
01:57:47,791 --> 01:57:51,960
you're just out there to kill
these animals. No, that's
not it. Like, um, I think,

2056
01:57:51,990 --> 01:57:52,201
you know,

2057
01:57:52,201 --> 01:57:55,800
like hunters have words and then everybody
else has these words that don't mean

2058
01:57:55,801 --> 01:57:58,170
the same thing as us.
Like hunters of this word,

2059
01:57:58,171 --> 01:58:01,530
like trophy hunting or whatever where
they're looking for a large animal.

2060
01:58:01,950 --> 01:58:06,000
But for me like it doesn't mean
that I'm not eating it or whatever.

2061
01:58:06,001 --> 01:58:09,900
People have this different word
for it than I do. Like when I was,

2062
01:58:09,901 --> 01:58:11,580
when I said I was hunting for 30 days,

2063
01:58:11,940 --> 01:58:15,660
I could have killed probably a hundred
different deer and chose not to,

2064
01:58:15,661 --> 01:58:19,530
I did not kill it deer on that trip
and why I was looking for a big one,

2065
01:58:19,531 --> 01:58:20,940
but not because it was big,

2066
01:58:21,180 --> 01:58:26,180
because it was a challenge for me
to hunt the most mature animal.

2067
01:58:26,850 --> 01:58:29,490
Right.
And it made me be out there longer.

2068
01:58:29,491 --> 01:58:33,210
It put my skills instead of
against any deer against one deer.

2069
01:58:33,480 --> 01:58:35,790
And in that certain scenario I failed.

2070
01:58:35,791 --> 01:58:37,470
I was actually hunting
one particular year.

2071
01:58:37,471 --> 01:58:41,440
I ended up hunting that deer for three
years. I never got that deer. I never did.

2072
01:58:41,470 --> 01:58:45,040
You know, I probably put in
three months of time in scouting.

2073
01:58:45,280 --> 01:58:48,550
I saw him only twice in those three
months and was hunting one particular year

2074
01:58:48,551 --> 01:58:49,450
because it was huge.

2075
01:58:49,780 --> 01:58:53,680
And to me it was like the challenge
of it and I got to be in nature.

2076
01:58:53,681 --> 01:58:55,690
I mean I know more about those deer now.

2077
01:58:55,691 --> 01:58:59,680
I would sit there and watch them study
their patterns, like where they would go,

2078
01:58:59,681 --> 01:59:04,030
what their bachelor groups. We're just
like any nature channel, whatever.

2079
01:59:04,031 --> 01:59:07,720
And for me, I love those deer. Like I
don't want to see those deer disappear.

2080
01:59:07,930 --> 01:59:10,990
I don't want to see their
habitat be infringed upon.

2081
01:59:11,020 --> 01:59:15,280
I don't want to see like, you know,
it's not about killing these deer,

2082
01:59:15,281 --> 01:59:19,600
it's about being a part of
this system and prolonging it.

2083
01:59:19,601 --> 01:59:23,860
Like being out there hunting
and enjoying it and just,

2084
01:59:24,460 --> 01:59:25,810
you know,
doing my thing.

2085
01:59:26,400 --> 01:59:28,130
Yeah,
people have never experienced it.

2086
01:59:28,290 --> 01:59:32,610
Probably don't understand why it's so
fascinating and wonderful when you're out

2087
01:59:32,611 --> 01:59:32,940
there.

2088
01:59:32,940 --> 01:59:37,650
But I will suggest to those people to
keep an eye out for our British Columbia

2089
01:59:37,680 --> 01:59:42,000
grizzly episodes coming up because that
was an experience of us sitting on these

2090
01:59:42,001 --> 01:59:46,590
beautiful ridge tops watching grizzly
bears for almost two weeks of just like,

2091
01:59:48,090 --> 01:59:50,910
and that observation
is just like me saying,

2092
01:59:50,911 --> 01:59:54,750
it's just something like something
changes. How you feel about the animals,

2093
01:59:54,751 --> 01:59:57,720
how you feel about the land and how he
feel about your interaction out there.

2094
01:59:57,721 --> 02:00:01,440
It's, it's uh, it's pretty magical just to
be there. Well, when we were in Montana,

2095
02:00:01,441 --> 02:00:04,950
I felt that way about the sheep
because we weren't gonna hunt them,

2096
02:00:04,951 --> 02:00:09,660
but they were everywhere. We saw a lot
of them and it was, we sat many times,

2097
02:00:09,661 --> 02:00:13,260
we spent hours just sitting there watching
these sheep crawl up the side of this

2098
02:00:13,261 --> 02:00:16,200
mountain kind of freaking out.
Like, look at how they do that.

2099
02:00:16,201 --> 02:00:20,570
They're just crawling up this cliff.
The fuck are they doing that? It's,

2100
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:22,620
and since we weren't hunting them,

2101
02:00:22,621 --> 02:00:26,620
they just became objects of wilderness
fascination, you know, they weren't,

2102
02:00:27,090 --> 02:00:30,110
it wasn't like the same like
quick heartbeat it thing
like, oh this is it here.

2103
02:00:30,260 --> 02:00:32,670
Do you ever do you know, there
wasn't any of that. It was just like,

2104
02:00:32,970 --> 02:00:35,700
look at these crazy fucks with
their giant balls. Remember,

2105
02:00:35,701 --> 02:00:37,560
seems like fucking John Steve,

2106
02:00:37,590 --> 02:00:41,550
there was a video pull the video up cause
I gotta take a leak of uh, Steve, uh,

2107
02:00:41,610 --> 02:00:44,460
talking about, uh, big horn sheep balls.

2108
02:00:44,461 --> 02:00:47,390
It's odd as a ut youtube channel where he,

2109
02:00:47,610 --> 02:00:51,330
he has a goal of sharing one of those
and then eating their balls like right

2110
02:00:51,331 --> 02:00:55,620
away, pull it up as if
he can. But yeah, just,

2111
02:00:55,621 --> 02:00:59,130
just being out there. And I remember
we found mountain line shit too.

2112
02:00:59,160 --> 02:01:00,270
That was pretty fascinating.

2113
02:01:00,271 --> 02:01:04,500
We for this big rope of shit with
deer hair in it and it was like, Ooh,

2114
02:01:04,930 --> 02:01:09,720
like this is out here too.
Huh? Do you have any draw for
bear to, to hunt the bear?

2115
02:01:09,760 --> 02:01:12,210
Does that attract you at all?
Uh, only one though. I would eat,

2116
02:01:12,780 --> 02:01:16,550
I would want a hundred grizzly
bear. Uh, unless I could eat it. I,

2117
02:01:16,560 --> 02:01:19,890
I've heard conflicting stories about
whether or not you can eat a grizzly bear,

2118
02:01:19,950 --> 02:01:21,500
you know. Um, I've watched a,

2119
02:01:21,550 --> 02:01:26,130
an episode of one show where they ate
bear stake was a brown bear and they said

2120
02:01:26,131 --> 02:01:28,980
it was good, which show it. Do you
know what show that was? Alaska.

2121
02:01:28,981 --> 02:01:29,814
The last frontier,

2122
02:01:29,850 --> 02:01:34,560
the guy shot a bear that was eating
their cows and a wound up cooking it and

2123
02:01:34,561 --> 02:01:38,820
eating it and had a little campfire and
is eating this the bear stake. What is,

2124
02:01:39,020 --> 02:01:39,950
did you have grizzly?

2125
02:01:40,190 --> 02:01:43,800
I've never eaten grizzly. No, I've never,
I mean I've never been grizzly hunting.

2126
02:01:43,801 --> 02:01:47,000
It just not something that I'd
done, you know, I really like,

2127
02:01:47,001 --> 02:01:51,410
I've never been like a bear hunter,
Predator hunter kind of guy. I mean, I, I,

2128
02:01:51,920 --> 02:01:56,920
I stick to a lot of a deer and elk and
stuff in New Zealand and stuff like that.

2129
02:01:58,581 --> 02:02:03,410
I mean, I've, I've hunted bears and I gave
you some bare Salami. Yeah. It's really,

2130
02:02:03,411 --> 02:02:04,100
I mean,

2131
02:02:04,100 --> 02:02:06,950
you'll eat it and you like anybody that
reads that and says that's not good.

2132
02:02:06,951 --> 02:02:11,760
Salamis crazy. Like it's
good. Yeah. So you like bare,
it's just not something you,

2133
02:02:11,761 --> 02:02:15,140
you go after a lot. Yeah, it's not, it's
not my thing. There's guys that like,

2134
02:02:15,390 --> 02:02:16,450
like it and hunt.

2135
02:02:16,480 --> 02:02:20,150
And then what's the difference between
going after a Predator and going after

2136
02:02:20,151 --> 02:02:22,640
something that's a game animal?
Does it get you sort of,

2137
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:26,810
you feel like they're almost like
a kitten? Ah, sometimes. You know,

2138
02:02:26,820 --> 02:02:29,210
he's just kind of feel like that.
Like they're out there doing their thing.

2139
02:02:29,211 --> 02:02:32,270
Like you are sometimes, you know, I
mean, I don't have anything against it,

2140
02:02:32,330 --> 02:02:36,900
you know, it's not like I've bear hunted
and it's been fun and exciting. Um,

2141
02:02:37,080 --> 02:02:41,600
and I obviously eat everything I
shoot. So, um, if you killed the line,

2142
02:02:42,340 --> 02:02:45,730
I've killed the mountain line. That to
me in the past almost three years now,

2143
02:02:45,740 --> 02:02:50,090
huntin constantly with Steve has, was
the most exciting, just like balls out.

2144
02:02:50,091 --> 02:02:52,520
Fun Experience I've had is
chasing mountain lions in the,

2145
02:02:52,910 --> 02:02:56,990
we were in Arizona twice with dogs. I'd
never thought I would enjoy it. I've,

2146
02:02:56,991 --> 02:03:00,170
I was actually kind of opposed to it to
begin with. We never saw line whenever,

2147
02:03:00,171 --> 02:03:01,490
never killed the line,
never did anything.

2148
02:03:01,850 --> 02:03:05,600
But it was the most like if I got
fucking fired up. Isn't that crazy?

2149
02:03:05,601 --> 02:03:08,870
You didn't see a line. He didn't kill a
lion, but yet it was incredibly exciting.

2150
02:03:09,320 --> 02:03:13,580
It was. The dogs that go watching
hounds do their thing is just,

2151
02:03:13,581 --> 02:03:17,030
it's like adrenaline all day long and it's
just, it's a beautiful, it's beautiful.

2152
02:03:17,031 --> 02:03:21,250
These dogs are, you think, I wonder
what their vo two Max would be like.

2153
02:03:21,290 --> 02:03:25,200
Some of these dogs could run
for fucking ever, ever designed.

2154
02:03:25,620 --> 02:03:27,950
Do you have that video? Yeah.
Yeah. Play it because I got pissed.

2155
02:03:28,310 --> 02:03:29,150
We'll be right back folks.

2156
02:03:32,720 --> 02:03:33,970
The joint to the bone,

2157
02:03:34,240 --> 02:03:38,500
these are the parts of the animal that
hearkened back to the most original forms

2158
02:03:38,501 --> 02:03:41,440
of cooking it.
Chop it up and cook it.

2159
02:03:42,730 --> 02:03:45,550
You really don't get more primal
than a testicle. In my mind,

2160
02:03:45,820 --> 02:03:48,520
I would bring this down and share it
with the guys that I'm cooking for it,

2161
02:03:48,550 --> 02:03:50,800
but it's just never
going to go far enough.

2162
02:03:50,801 --> 02:03:54,080
There's inevitably going to be guys that
are real jealous and get a slice sauce

2163
02:03:54,090 --> 02:03:56,070
going to eat it myself.
So we kinda like to cook spouse.

2164
02:03:56,071 --> 02:04:00,720
So that's the do not look, look for one
that Joe Rogan is into with the she.

2165
02:04:00,980 --> 02:04:04,530
The only way I've ever cooked these
from game is in butter to do like butter

2166
02:04:04,531 --> 02:04:06,490
balls. Butternut. Basically.

2167
02:04:06,560 --> 02:04:09,570
I'm just like poach and
this thing and bought her

2168
02:04:11,210 --> 02:04:13,930
little red hots.
Okay.

2169
02:04:14,920 --> 02:04:18,220
Morocco. No, it's a, it was
in Montana. It was one of the,

2170
02:04:18,750 --> 02:04:21,730
it was one of the trailers for when Joe
and Brian came out to Montana first.

2171
02:04:25,200 --> 02:04:28,810
Oh, I had those ready. Yeah. One of those.

2172
02:04:31,980 --> 02:04:33,950
It's like it's something wax and poetic.
Yeah,

2173
02:04:34,690 --> 02:04:38,020
she,
there it

2174
02:04:38,070 --> 02:04:39,540
is.
She had the wrong one.

2175
02:04:51,320 --> 02:04:52,680
Big Horn right up there.

2176
02:04:59,210 --> 02:05:04,210
You go home and tell people what a bad
spot I took you to and you say four.

2177
02:05:04,951 --> 02:05:06,530
We did see a lot of big horns though.

2178
02:05:06,750 --> 02:05:09,960
What they're going to say is
something like, what kind of dumb ass?

2179
02:05:10,170 --> 02:05:11,690
Me Older in big Horn county.

2180
02:05:17,010 --> 02:05:19,200
You've never seen a scrolling.

2181
02:05:25,590 --> 02:05:28,400
I'd love to show you from
turn. Right. I'll look short.

2182
02:05:30,980 --> 02:05:33,210
It's like a,
it's like a church bell.

2183
02:05:35,400 --> 02:05:39,490
Look at church bell hanging down
between his legs. Wow. What a cool,

2184
02:05:40,720 --> 02:05:45,260
sweet.
Were you able to see that church?

2185
02:05:46,270 --> 02:05:50,510
It's impressive. It's huge.
Want to do all big warranty.

2186
02:05:51,920 --> 02:05:56,780
The first thing I'm going to do when I
kill him one and then punch my tag and

2187
02:05:56,781 --> 02:06:00,920
I'm to eat the contents of that side.
Just straight out.

2188
02:06:01,160 --> 02:06:05,900
Just raw. Just right
there like apples. Wow.

2189
02:06:08,900 --> 02:06:11,900
Feel called to do that.
I'm sitting on a cactus.

2190
02:06:15,200 --> 02:06:19,850
It looks so nice though. Right there.
He was so fucking cold as shit. So cold.

2191
02:06:19,880 --> 02:06:21,920
I had cactus in my legs for three months.

2192
02:06:23,910 --> 02:06:28,220
I did videos, a funny video of
Callen plucking my, uh, my legs.

2193
02:06:28,221 --> 02:06:29,480
That's also on the same channel.

2194
02:06:29,810 --> 02:06:33,560
Plucking a cactus out of my legs in front
of the fire. When I sat down the shoot,

2195
02:06:33,561 --> 02:06:34,394
that deer,

2196
02:06:35,410 --> 02:06:39,500
I must have got at least 50 or 60
cactus needles in my leg. It was crazy.

2197
02:06:40,400 --> 02:06:44,960
They last forever, but it wasn't a bad,
lasts forever. It was like a welcome sign.

2198
02:06:46,730 --> 02:06:50,540
Dan Toady off to the can. Yeah. The, um,

2199
02:06:50,660 --> 02:06:51,890
this is Brian Cowen,

2200
02:06:52,070 --> 02:06:55,970
my leg out and I mean he
must have pulled no bs,

2201
02:06:55,971 --> 02:06:59,840
at least 50 of those things.
How to me this way.

2202
02:07:00,130 --> 02:07:05,130
You look like I had like little zits
all over me for like a couple of weeks

2203
02:07:05,180 --> 02:07:05,181
afterwards.

2204
02:07:05,181 --> 02:07:09,200
It took a while for them to all pop
through the skin likes I'd be taking a

2205
02:07:09,201 --> 02:07:12,560
shower and I'd wash out feeling
like it felt like stubble,

2206
02:07:12,960 --> 02:07:15,660
but it was really just a cactus going.
They're just stuck inside of it.

2207
02:07:15,900 --> 02:07:20,140
Can feel that. And your face is level
two, your friend's ass, the pulling

2208
02:07:20,430 --> 02:07:22,260
will's out of his ass.
That's a real friend.

2209
02:07:22,830 --> 02:07:27,090
I have a new appreciation for his
glute and upper thigh development.

2210
02:07:29,250 --> 02:07:33,150
What was that movie where the guy sits
on a cactus and he thinks a rattlesnake?

2211
02:07:33,450 --> 02:07:36,040
I know buddies like, you know,
he's going to like suck the

2212
02:07:36,040 --> 02:07:40,810
venom out. Oh, that was, wasn't that
a Dan Akroyd movie or something? Gosh,

2213
02:07:40,811 --> 02:07:44,440
I can't remember. I don't remember.
Yeah, that's always the joke, right?

2214
02:07:44,441 --> 02:07:49,240
Suck the venom out. Can you actually
do that? Um, and it's not recommended.

2215
02:07:49,570 --> 02:07:53,800
It's not right now. I mean, I think
you can't actually do that. Yes.

2216
02:07:53,950 --> 02:07:58,720
Should the normal person, no,
it'd be a real extreme situation.

2217
02:07:58,721 --> 02:08:02,750
You'd prefer to like suck
it out with something else.
But, um, because of what Ha,

2218
02:08:02,860 --> 02:08:06,700
what can happen is then the venoms in
your mouth can travel your blood stream

2219
02:08:06,701 --> 02:08:11,200
pretty easily through your mouth if you
don't do it right. It is possible. But,

2220
02:08:11,520 --> 02:08:14,590
um, like what do you do? How do you
do it? What I would suggest is like,

2221
02:08:14,591 --> 02:08:18,040
say you're in the middle of nowhere.
You get bit by a rattlesnake. Um,

2222
02:08:18,070 --> 02:08:20,980
first thing you're going
to do is like put the area,

2223
02:08:20,981 --> 02:08:22,990
you don't want to blow your
heart. So, you know what I mean?

2224
02:08:23,080 --> 02:08:25,630
Just kind of keep it or like if it's in
your hand, your arm, your leg or whatever.

2225
02:08:26,080 --> 02:08:29,980
Um, I would maybe make like a
tourniquet, not super tight,

2226
02:08:30,040 --> 02:08:33,680
but you know, I mean a little
bit. And then you could uh,

2227
02:08:33,700 --> 02:08:37,180
use like some sterilize a knife
or something, cut it open. Um,

2228
02:08:37,210 --> 02:08:41,200
he like water in a metal
bottle or something. Um,

2229
02:08:41,290 --> 02:08:42,940
and then like if you have like a,

2230
02:08:42,970 --> 02:08:46,420
I kind of felt like this metal
canteen or something or hot water,

2231
02:08:46,421 --> 02:08:50,710
pour it into it and now gene bottle
like boiling water and then stick it up

2232
02:08:50,711 --> 02:08:55,210
against it on the outside. And as that
water cools, it creates like a suction.

2233
02:08:55,440 --> 02:08:57,370
It'll actually like suck
the blood and the venom out.

2234
02:08:57,550 --> 02:09:02,080
It's like a makeshift Suction Cup, you
know? So do you cut the wound open?

2235
02:09:02,120 --> 02:09:05,470
You come, you can cut. I don't know.
Sometimes they say don't do it sometimes,

2236
02:09:05,500 --> 02:09:10,300
you know, they say don't. But I
would, I mean people say you just,

2237
02:09:10,390 --> 02:09:13,670
you just dress it like a wound and
get, get what you need to go. Yeah.

2238
02:09:13,960 --> 02:09:17,350
We're talking like you can't get four.
You need to go then what?

2239
02:09:17,351 --> 02:09:19,840
He is not going to kill you Ralph.
Thanks. I'm not going to kill you,

2240
02:09:19,870 --> 02:09:22,990
but don't they do massive
damage to your tissue? Yeah.

2241
02:09:22,991 --> 02:09:26,920
My grandpa's the same grandpa, the crazy
grandpa. He's been bit three times.

2242
02:09:28,920 --> 02:09:32,550
Tell, tell him the story of
[inaudible] who died. This is the,

2243
02:09:32,551 --> 02:09:35,790
this is the craziest story. And you
know, some of these stories, you're like,

2244
02:09:35,791 --> 02:09:36,760
is this true?
But this is

2245
02:09:36,910 --> 02:09:41,490
been confirmed by like the
dude who this happened to. So
He's, he was, uh, you know,

2246
02:09:41,500 --> 02:09:44,710
he's a professional boxer and he
thought he was, you know, pretty quick.

2247
02:09:44,711 --> 02:09:46,140
I don't know what he'd
do. He like, I'm quick,

2248
02:09:46,220 --> 02:09:51,200
I'm going to snake, you know. So
he gets hammered by a rattlesnake.

2249
02:09:51,260 --> 02:09:53,510
I think he, he caught a rattlesnake.
He thought he killed it.

2250
02:09:53,511 --> 02:09:57,740
He put in a bucket and then it
bit him. So, and he was, I can't,

2251
02:09:57,830 --> 02:10:01,880
I don't remember where he's at. So He's,
he's, uh, gets bit by this rattlesnake.

2252
02:10:01,881 --> 02:10:04,400
So he's driving himself into the hospital.

2253
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:07,490
He blacks out while he's driving,

2254
02:10:08,030 --> 02:10:11,240
runs through the front of a gas station,

2255
02:10:12,710 --> 02:10:16,820
convenience store, the whole
deal. And, uh, he breaks through,

2256
02:10:16,821 --> 02:10:19,870
the owner runs up,
he role opens the door.

2257
02:10:19,910 --> 02:10:23,000
My grandpa rolls out of the
truck holding a live rattlesnake.

2258
02:10:26,450 --> 02:10:29,590
There will be a movie made.
I like that.

2259
02:10:29,600 --> 02:10:32,900
It would be the craziest moving. You'd
be like, there's no way any of this.

2260
02:10:32,901 --> 02:10:33,980
And it's like,
he

2261
02:10:33,980 --> 02:10:38,150
was, that's what I'm getting at.
When you live like in this wildlife,

2262
02:10:38,480 --> 02:10:40,460
a lot of crazy things happen.
I mean,

2263
02:10:40,730 --> 02:10:45,140
he's just one of those guys that just
never, he just lived life, you know,

2264
02:10:45,170 --> 02:10:48,140
and he just,
Shit just always happened.

2265
02:10:48,141 --> 02:10:51,350
Like he had so many crazy I could go
on for days about just some of the most

2266
02:10:51,440 --> 02:10:53,450
unbelievable stories, you
know, like that is awesome.

2267
02:10:54,680 --> 02:10:58,190
He just kept it Florida the whole time.
He just, he lived on the edge, you know,

2268
02:10:58,570 --> 02:11:02,030
this was one of my favorite
stories is he went into a bar,

2269
02:11:02,031 --> 02:11:05,590
I think it was up in Virginia city. Nevada
is like a bike, you know, like anyways,

2270
02:11:05,591 --> 02:11:09,930
there's like this biker group that was
in there kind of taken over the bar and

2271
02:11:10,130 --> 02:11:14,030
kicking people out. Right? So he goes
out, him and his buddy were in there.

2272
02:11:14,340 --> 02:11:17,300
He tells the buddy, go
warm up the truck. The Guy,

2273
02:11:17,350 --> 02:11:19,670
he's a go warm up the truck
parking at that corner right there.

2274
02:11:20,600 --> 02:11:23,320
He's standing there and you help bikers
line up their motorcycles all along the

2275
02:11:23,720 --> 02:11:26,660
the edge.
He goes and kicks over one bicycle,

2276
02:11:26,690 --> 02:11:30,260
kicks him all over and domino fashion
tells a guy, walk in and say, Hey,

2277
02:11:30,261 --> 02:11:32,480
somebody kicked your your
bikes over out there.

2278
02:11:32,750 --> 02:11:35,240
And he's standing at the door and
as these dudes are running out,

2279
02:11:35,241 --> 02:11:36,980
he's one hit hitting.
I'm knocking them out.

2280
02:11:37,250 --> 02:11:38,920
He said he knocked about
four of a mountain.

2281
02:11:39,030 --> 02:11:42,200
I ran to the truck,
drove off.

2282
02:11:45,910 --> 02:11:46,890
I mean, he's, he's just

2283
02:11:46,930 --> 02:11:49,140
like a,
a mountain man cowboy

2284
02:11:49,220 --> 02:11:50,360
his whole life,
you know,

2285
02:11:51,860 --> 02:11:56,120
it's refreshing to know the crazy assholes
like that actually existed and did

2286
02:11:56,121 --> 02:12:00,970
live that life. And then they have
like grandkids like me, you know? Well,

2287
02:12:00,980 --> 02:12:03,410
all things considered, he
came out great. Exactly.

2288
02:12:05,100 --> 02:12:08,400
That's a very unusual thing
for a 28 year old guy. 28 yeah.

2289
02:12:08,630 --> 02:12:11,070
28 year old guy to live is most,
you know,

2290
02:12:11,071 --> 02:12:14,810
a giant chunk of your life to be in
the woods and living in the wilderness.

2291
02:12:14,920 --> 02:12:17,530
Yeah, it's definitely,
it's a one of those things.

2292
02:12:17,531 --> 02:12:20,070
I think like I graduated high
school and I knew what I,

2293
02:12:20,380 --> 02:12:23,320
I knew what I always loved and I just
like, I'm gonna make this in my life.

2294
02:12:23,321 --> 02:12:27,010
And people around how you knew that I'm
just going to start doing it, you know,

2295
02:12:27,210 --> 02:12:30,910
cause like I think after high school I
remember I actually graduated high school.

2296
02:12:30,911 --> 02:12:32,830
It's like a lot of college
credits. So I was like, man,

2297
02:12:33,260 --> 02:12:38,260
instead of go to school the fall semester
I'm going to travel around and hunt as

2298
02:12:39,401 --> 02:12:44,080
much as I can and then I'll write a book.
Okay. Did you, did you write a book? No,

2299
02:12:44,200 --> 02:12:47,490
still haven't wrote a book. I'm still
living it and I started it at all. I,

2300
02:12:47,491 --> 02:12:50,590
you know, I have, I've, I've started some
stuff because I've got like a lot of,

2301
02:12:50,890 --> 02:12:52,510
just like a lot of crazy
things have happened.

2302
02:12:52,510 --> 02:12:55,000
And so what I did was while
I went to college, every,

2303
02:12:55,001 --> 02:13:00,001
I would take six months off in the fall
and work as a guide and hunt and travel

2304
02:13:00,281 --> 02:13:03,190
and essentially do what I'm doing.

2305
02:13:03,250 --> 02:13:07,690
How far in advance are you booked for
guide stuff? Um, almost two years.

2306
02:13:08,200 --> 02:13:11,860
Two years? Yeah. Like
this year, next year.

2307
02:13:12,640 --> 02:13:16,660
Next year we, um, you know, we,
we've got, he, he's like 2015,

2308
02:13:16,661 --> 02:13:19,690
I guess we start booking now, you know,
and then New Zealand stuff is Kinda like,

2309
02:13:20,020 --> 02:13:22,840
you could pretty much come whenever
if you're, if you're like ready to go,

2310
02:13:22,990 --> 02:13:26,920
just go. So your, your guide stuff
is a lot of repeat businesses,

2311
02:13:26,921 --> 02:13:27,970
people that have been with you many,

2312
02:13:27,971 --> 02:13:31,380
many times and just book everything in
advance. Exactly. And then what happens,

2313
02:13:31,381 --> 02:13:33,180
because I've got so many like repeat guys,
you know,

2314
02:13:33,181 --> 02:13:37,110
I have other guides that worked for me.
It's like a fairly good size operation.

2315
02:13:37,500 --> 02:13:41,430
Um, and then uh, you know,
like repeats book every year.

2316
02:13:41,431 --> 02:13:44,910
But the new guys that want to end,
they've got to go like a year or two out.

2317
02:13:44,911 --> 02:13:47,340
So they get all their buddies
together and go year or two out.

2318
02:13:47,341 --> 02:13:51,870
And so you get kind of like backlog that
way. Yeah. Wow. That's wild. So that's,

2319
02:13:51,871 --> 02:13:55,680
that's actually a pretty fucking
stable business. Um, well,

2320
02:13:55,681 --> 02:13:57,570
yes and no because you got like a lot of,

2321
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:01,290
at any given moment the regulations
could change and I'd be out of business,

2322
02:14:01,291 --> 02:14:06,030
you know, like, I mean, hunting is
very, very regulated and it should be,

2323
02:14:06,031 --> 02:14:10,710
I mean it's, if you do it right, it's
the purpose of it is for conservation.

2324
02:14:10,830 --> 02:14:14,610
And so yeah, I mean they're looking
at numbers and tags and all this.

2325
02:14:14,611 --> 02:14:17,550
And so at any moment where I do
my stuff could change. That's why,

2326
02:14:17,850 --> 02:14:21,210
that's why I started doing things
in New Zealand because every,

2327
02:14:21,360 --> 02:14:23,790
all the animals in New Zealand
are not supposed to be there.

2328
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:27,270
So Environmental Sunamerica don't
want any animals that dead, you know,

2329
02:14:27,540 --> 02:14:31,530
environmental send New Zealand went all
the non native animals dead because they

2330
02:14:31,531 --> 02:14:33,780
eat the native grasses and they
aren't supposed to be there. This,

2331
02:14:33,781 --> 02:14:37,210
that and the other thing, you know, so
it's like there's no regulation. Yeah,

2332
02:14:37,220 --> 02:14:39,630
you guys killed the Canadian
goose with a high powered rifle.

2333
02:14:39,970 --> 02:14:42,840
I was just delicious. I bet
it was. But you know, I mean,

2334
02:14:42,841 --> 02:14:46,530
you think about it like Himalayan target
or just like they're one of the coolest

2335
02:14:46,531 --> 02:14:47,970
animals on the planet to me and they just,

2336
02:14:48,210 --> 02:14:52,260
the country they live in is so
rough and you know, New Zealand,

2337
02:14:52,261 --> 02:14:54,660
the southern Alps is almost
identical to the Himalayas.

2338
02:14:54,661 --> 02:14:58,200
Like that's where Sir Edmund Hillary
trained was on Mount Cook and New Zealand

2339
02:14:58,470 --> 02:15:01,650
for his first ascent to Everest.
I mean it's like we're,

2340
02:15:01,651 --> 02:15:06,600
me and Steve went hunting in that
episode that was in the Mount Cook area.

2341
02:15:06,601 --> 02:15:06,811
I mean,

2342
02:15:06,811 --> 02:15:10,620
we were hunting some of the roughest
mountains in the world and you're hunting

2343
02:15:10,621 --> 02:15:15,300
an animal that on its home range is
almost gone. And here there's like,

2344
02:15:15,660 --> 02:15:19,490
there's too many. It's overpopulated.
Wow. That is fascinating. Yeah.

2345
02:15:19,920 --> 02:15:22,250
Cool stories.
No predators shoot cars in New Zealand.

2346
02:15:24,560 --> 02:15:28,200
I don't know if we should tell a story.
I think Steve told us what happened.

2347
02:15:29,060 --> 02:15:33,590
Somebody shot a car. Yeah, no,
no, no, not so, okay. Well,

2348
02:15:35,330 --> 02:15:37,740
none of us, none of us
professionals. This is like

2349
02:15:38,040 --> 02:15:42,330
some other dude. We hired right
as a packer for that episode.

2350
02:15:42,780 --> 02:15:46,290
And after we crossed the river,
we sent him back,

2351
02:15:46,291 --> 02:15:49,890
hiked back to the vehicles to charge
batteries and he's sitting in the car like

2352
02:15:49,920 --> 02:15:53,900
fucking around with something and
apparently he comes back like we're like,

2353
02:15:53,920 --> 02:15:58,410
what happened to Ben? We're back in the
hut. Like Ben's like roomy. I need to have

2354
02:15:58,880 --> 02:16:01,170
no, he opens the door. We're
all in this little warming.

2355
02:16:01,380 --> 02:16:06,090
And is this the most sheepish face? Yeah,
I could imagine. Peaks, innocence. Remi,

2356
02:16:06,450 --> 02:16:10,980
can I talk to you? I was
like, do you didn't run the
truck out of diesel digit? No,

2357
02:16:11,670 --> 02:16:14,000
but I need to have a word. Okay,
so we go. So he's like, Hey,

2358
02:16:14,001 --> 02:16:16,470
I don't know to tell you this man is shot.
Your car

2359
02:16:18,270 --> 02:16:21,990
blew the fuel line.
The only line with a shotgun from inside.

2360
02:16:21,991 --> 02:16:24,480
He was sitting in the driver's seat.
He fired through the floor,

2361
02:16:24,510 --> 02:16:28,890
blew the fuel line and we had to tow
this truck. What was it like 30 miles,

2362
02:16:28,900 --> 02:16:29,770
30 miles down

2363
02:16:30,040 --> 02:16:32,380
like a river? No road. No road through.

2364
02:16:32,381 --> 02:16:36,520
We had to river crossings where the
truck is tied to the truck in front,

2365
02:16:36,700 --> 02:16:41,120
just dragging across the river where the
water is like flowing the drug. And so,

2366
02:16:41,320 --> 02:16:45,010
I mean, here's the thing, the dude was
Australian. I mean I liked the guy,

2367
02:16:45,100 --> 02:16:45,671
he's a friend,

2368
02:16:45,671 --> 02:16:50,671
but a Aussies don't have semiautomatic
weapons and he thought it would be try to

2369
02:16:50,831 --> 02:16:53,860
figure out how it works.
Oops.

2370
02:16:54,430 --> 02:16:58,330
In a truck with a loaded gun at he did.
Obviously it was an accident.

2371
02:16:58,360 --> 02:17:02,560
You didn't know it was loaded. It
was scary. I, you know, I was like,

2372
02:17:04,020 --> 02:17:04,300
you know,

2373
02:17:04,300 --> 02:17:07,990
I'm like when it comes to firearms
safety or any kind of safety like that,

2374
02:17:07,991 --> 02:17:11,200
I am the biggest stickler on the planet
because you don't get second chances

2375
02:17:11,201 --> 02:17:11,891
with that kind of stuff.

2376
02:17:11,891 --> 02:17:15,610
Like it's not something to mess around
with an any real like any hunter,

2377
02:17:15,611 --> 02:17:19,090
any gun owner knows that that's key.

2378
02:17:19,090 --> 02:17:23,830
Like you don't mess around with guns.
It's 100% the law,

2379
02:17:23,860 --> 02:17:27,520
you know, in, in my mind and my
friend's mind and everybody else's mind.

2380
02:17:27,521 --> 02:17:30,910
But he was by himself. He was just
kind of bored and messing around. Like,

2381
02:17:30,911 --> 02:17:35,170
what's this do? What's this button do
home? What's this do? Oh okay. Boom.

2382
02:17:35,680 --> 02:17:39,990
Oh yeah. I don't even know how the
fuck you could have done that. Uh Eh,

2383
02:17:40,540 --> 02:17:44,500
it makes no sense. I just play it
over and over again and you'll let me,

2384
02:17:44,501 --> 02:17:48,670
let me tell you like the Australian
jokes that were flying after that like oh

2385
02:17:48,671 --> 02:17:52,270
yeah. Ozzies are so good at shooting. They
can hit a truck on while it's running.

2386
02:17:52,540 --> 02:17:57,130
You know? Now you guys, uh,

2387
02:17:57,220 --> 02:18:01,760
in the New Zealand one you, you
haunted a tar, you hunted a,

2388
02:18:01,840 --> 02:18:05,580
what was the analyst? Shania. Is that the
same stuff that shammy cloth has made?

2389
02:18:05,581 --> 02:18:09,640
Yeah, that is, yeah. Why does it absorb
water like that? Like shammy cloth,

2390
02:18:09,641 --> 02:18:11,380
they used to clean up
yards. The leather, they,

2391
02:18:11,710 --> 02:18:14,140
it's just absorbing and
just soaks up the water.

2392
02:18:14,141 --> 02:18:16,300
And I think it has to do
with where they live. They,

2393
02:18:16,570 --> 02:18:20,650
their bodies are designed to soak up
that water and like wool, they're there.

2394
02:18:20,680 --> 02:18:22,780
Their hides a real woolly.
So wolves,

2395
02:18:22,781 --> 02:18:25,570
one of the only fabrics that
when it gets wet it retains,

2396
02:18:25,571 --> 02:18:29,530
its like our value of insulation.
So what they do is they get wet,

2397
02:18:29,531 --> 02:18:32,670
they expand in the,
their skin is like a wet suit.

2398
02:18:32,830 --> 02:18:35,080
You know how you get a wet suit,
you're like, it's freezing out,

2399
02:18:35,410 --> 02:18:38,860
but water gets inside and it keeps you
warm. They're kind of a stinky critter.

2400
02:18:38,890 --> 02:18:43,120
Those Shami, they got the gas
smell to them. I think Tara,

2401
02:18:43,240 --> 02:18:46,040
Tara definitely smell with both
of those things where it goes,

2402
02:18:47,270 --> 02:18:50,830
I was good cars. Good. Yeah,
Tarzan. One of my favorite animals.

2403
02:18:50,831 --> 02:18:53,800
But it's also like when
you go on a tar hunt,

2404
02:18:53,860 --> 02:18:57,070
it's a it in my opinion,
it's like it's an expedition.

2405
02:18:57,100 --> 02:19:01,010
You don't just like roll out and go, I'm
going to go shoot a target today. No,

2406
02:19:01,030 --> 02:19:05,170
you're like, you better be,
you're in the shit. You know?

2407
02:19:05,500 --> 02:19:06,520
I mean like when we got up there,

2408
02:19:06,521 --> 02:19:10,690
I was getting on these guys like we
have to leave before the sun. Yeah.

2409
02:19:11,350 --> 02:19:13,030
Before the shade hits this mountain.

2410
02:19:13,150 --> 02:19:15,820
Otherwise we sleep here
because you will die.

2411
02:19:16,210 --> 02:19:21,210
Because what happens is that the snow
mounts is within like an hour of the shade

2412
02:19:23,231 --> 02:19:26,680
hitting where the snow melts. It'll
turn to ice and you can't stop yourself.

2413
02:19:26,681 --> 02:19:28,220
And you'll just go off of 3000

2414
02:19:28,220 --> 02:19:30,980
foot cliff. Yeah, they're looking at it
right. Actually that's a tar right there.

2415
02:19:30,981 --> 02:19:34,730
So I don't think we have the shot
directly below those tar. Actually,

2416
02:19:34,731 --> 02:19:36,470
I don't know if that's a cross
that was across the river,

2417
02:19:36,790 --> 02:19:40,820
but where are we climbed up to?
Was literally probably a 1500 foot cliff.

2418
02:19:40,850 --> 02:19:44,450
Like just fucking drink. Fuck. It was,

2419
02:19:44,890 --> 02:19:48,500
well I remember that being a concern with
where you shot the animal because you

2420
02:19:48,501 --> 02:19:52,190
don't want to go off and fly off the
edge. Yeah, turn into hamburger. Exactly.

2421
02:19:52,490 --> 02:19:56,060
What happens when a tar flies
off a cliff drops 1500 feet.

2422
02:19:56,090 --> 02:20:00,350
Do you just leave it down there? Do you
go down and get it? You, you get it. I,

2423
02:20:00,380 --> 02:20:02,860
so this year for the sole hunters deal,
I,

2424
02:20:02,900 --> 02:20:07,880
I did this trip on my own and I crossed
the river. The river was so like crazy.

2425
02:20:07,910 --> 02:20:12,110
The water is flowing over the hood
and it's full inside the vehicle.

2426
02:20:12,320 --> 02:20:13,340
Like my ankles,

2427
02:20:13,370 --> 02:20:16,340
you fill the truck up with water to
cross because it keeps the weight down,

2428
02:20:16,341 --> 02:20:20,210
keeps it from floating and flipping.
So I've got a snorkel on my tracking.

2429
02:20:20,390 --> 02:20:23,570
Some of this I don't like couldn't
really cut because when you don't have a

2430
02:20:23,571 --> 02:20:26,840
camera guy, it's like fricking impossible
to cover everything. You know? He's like,

2431
02:20:26,850 --> 02:20:29,810
I really wish I would have covered that.
But when you're like I might die,

2432
02:20:29,811 --> 02:20:33,110
I'm not going to Dick around
with, you know, whatever.

2433
02:20:33,111 --> 02:20:35,570
So some of the good
crossing I didn't catch,

2434
02:20:35,571 --> 02:20:38,840
but I did get some of the other stuff
anyways. I mean you go across the river,

2435
02:20:39,070 --> 02:20:43,040
you're floating down the river and when
the water's going over and your heart is

2436
02:20:43,041 --> 02:20:46,010
like literally in your throat,
it's the scariest shit ever.

2437
02:20:46,340 --> 02:20:49,910
And then you get off and uh,
well you don't get off. But

2438
02:20:52,850 --> 02:20:57,340
I don't, I'm not quite, so the
cab of the vehicle is full? Yeah.

2439
02:20:57,360 --> 02:21:02,210
How are you breathing? I Dunno. Not
fully full like a where you'd be sitting.

2440
02:21:02,340 --> 02:21:05,330
So like where your feet,
you know what I mean? Yeah.

2441
02:21:05,400 --> 02:21:09,530
So I've got holes in the floor. So like
when when I do severe river crossings,

2442
02:21:09,800 --> 02:21:13,700
the level fills up. So then
like the, it like keeps,

2443
02:21:14,540 --> 02:21:17,960
keeps it down. So it was not full of air.
Did you have a special vehicle for them?

2444
02:21:18,250 --> 02:21:22,720
It's just a Toyota, just a
Toyota four runner. So diesel,

2445
02:21:23,090 --> 02:21:24,170
Toyota,
four runner.

2446
02:21:24,171 --> 02:21:27,520
And you put some quite a exhaust smart
goals so that it can be deep underwater

2447
02:21:27,530 --> 02:21:29,930
because otherwise where
the exhaust tips are,

2448
02:21:29,931 --> 02:21:32,870
if water gets in there and it stops,
the combustion is exactly,

2449
02:21:32,871 --> 02:21:36,050
if water gets in the engine, then it
doesn't work. It needs air to breathe.

2450
02:21:36,051 --> 02:21:40,680
So the snorkels up like right at
the top of the left window. Um,

2451
02:21:40,820 --> 02:21:43,040
and so what I,
you cross kind of like at a 45.

2452
02:21:43,040 --> 02:21:47,000
So you go up river and then you 45 down,
you know,

2453
02:21:47,001 --> 02:21:48,900
because that's the safest.
Um,

2454
02:21:48,910 --> 02:21:51,810
and then you just kind of
like are floating down driving
you here. I mean, you're,

2455
02:21:51,830 --> 02:21:56,830
it's grinding and waters over the hood
and everything and you're looking at your

2456
02:21:57,201 --> 02:22:01,010
window in the waters. Maybe halfway up
my nose just pull out like muddy water.

2457
02:22:01,280 --> 02:22:04,290
So then you cross and uh,
and then I,

2458
02:22:04,380 --> 02:22:08,620
I hiked up to this spot and uh, you
know, I'm Tara hunting and this,

2459
02:22:08,720 --> 02:22:12,340
that's like my favorite thing to do is
just an adventure every time. And uh,

2460
02:22:12,380 --> 02:22:14,480
I get up there and I,

2461
02:22:14,620 --> 02:22:18,620
I actually bow hunted up there like
a week before it was unsuccessful,

2462
02:22:18,621 --> 02:22:19,550
just really bad weather.

2463
02:22:19,551 --> 02:22:24,440
So I went back with a rifle and I
shoot this tar and I thought like,

2464
02:22:24,470 --> 02:22:26,280
oh, it looks good. Well fell

2465
02:22:26,280 --> 02:22:29,280
into a waterfall,
like the top of a waterfall.

2466
02:22:29,760 --> 02:22:33,270
So then I had to film myself scaling down,
climbing,

2467
02:22:33,271 --> 02:22:37,920
and then I hook it off the waterfall and
then go down in the next bit to where I

2468
02:22:37,921 --> 02:22:41,310
could cut it up and pack it out.
Wow.

2469
02:22:41,450 --> 02:22:44,360
And if you'd never seen a tar before,
they don't look like a real animal.

2470
02:22:44,361 --> 02:22:49,040
It looks like something out of Star Wars.
It's like a gorilla with horns. Yeah.

2471
02:22:49,480 --> 02:22:54,410
It's like a lion. Gorilla horns go. It's
crazy. They're cool. Yeah. They have very,

2472
02:22:54,411 --> 02:22:56,870
very bizarre here.
See if you can pull up one.

2473
02:22:57,990 --> 02:23:01,490
There might even have a,
they might even have one from the show.

2474
02:23:01,520 --> 02:23:04,400
There might be a video.
You guys have more videos online now.

2475
02:23:04,401 --> 02:23:08,030
And I understand that mediator is
now going to have a digital downloads

2476
02:23:08,031 --> 02:23:11,300
available. So you could, you could you
get down, I believe we're working on it.

2477
02:23:11,360 --> 02:23:14,330
It's not up yet. It's not something
you go right now and download.

2478
02:23:14,331 --> 02:23:15,380
But we're working,

2479
02:23:15,620 --> 02:23:18,170
we're getting there but trying to
get people to watch the show trying.

2480
02:23:18,220 --> 02:23:22,140
So there it is right there.
That's the tar. And that's uh,

2481
02:23:22,370 --> 02:23:25,820
one of the weird situations where they
weren't sure if it was a good place to

2482
02:23:25,821 --> 02:23:28,520
shoot it because it was right near that,
at the edge of that cliff.

2483
02:23:29,030 --> 02:23:30,440
It's tough to tell from there,
but

2484
02:23:31,090 --> 02:23:31,900
you would have done,

2485
02:23:31,900 --> 02:23:35,250
if anybody wants to check out the solo
hunter episodes from last year that that

2486
02:23:35,260 --> 02:23:37,750
waterfall bull will be on this season.
Um,

2487
02:23:37,751 --> 02:23:39,850
but last year if you go to
the solo hunters website,

2488
02:23:39,880 --> 02:23:42,350
I think it's a solo hundreds, tv.com. Um,

2489
02:23:42,370 --> 02:23:44,500
we've got every episode
up online right now.

2490
02:23:44,610 --> 02:23:48,030
Great. Great. So you can
just watch everything. Great
show. I've got Dvr, I got,

2491
02:23:48,031 --> 02:23:50,810
I don't know how many episodes on the Dvr,
but you have to go on a mind on this.

2492
02:23:51,420 --> 02:23:55,980
Check them all off. Great
show man. Because it's, it's
again a unique perspective.

2493
02:23:56,010 --> 02:23:58,970
Um, we were talking
about how Dan is so, uh,

2494
02:23:59,100 --> 02:24:01,740
into making sure that it doesn't look,

2495
02:24:02,040 --> 02:24:04,950
that mediator doesn't look like the
average hunting show. What's soul hunters?

2496
02:24:04,951 --> 02:24:05,784
It's like,

2497
02:24:05,850 --> 02:24:10,320
it's so unusual to see a guy wandering
through whether it's you or what was the

2498
02:24:10,321 --> 02:24:13,440
other guy's name? Tim Barnett.
Uh, I watched another one,

2499
02:24:13,441 --> 02:24:15,450
I watched two of them last night.
One with you in Africa,

2500
02:24:15,451 --> 02:24:18,990
another one with him shooting a Moose
and he was trying to drag this fucking

2501
02:24:18,991 --> 02:24:23,580
moose out of the water by itself.
And it was just like, God damn,

2502
02:24:23,581 --> 02:24:27,060
that thing is 1200 pounds.
This is fucking huge. And he's,

2503
02:24:27,120 --> 02:24:28,740
I mean he doesn't really a weak guy,

2504
02:24:28,741 --> 02:24:32,040
but I mean how the fuck are you going
to drag that thing out of the water?

2505
02:24:32,041 --> 02:24:34,320
It's like a lot of this like inches,
herbs,

2506
02:24:35,910 --> 02:24:38,340
hernia waiting to have.
Yeah.

2507
02:24:38,341 --> 02:24:40,360
That's the last thing you
want to have in Alaska too.

2508
02:24:41,620 --> 02:24:44,750
That's the nice thing, like if if you're
by yourself, you want them in the water,

2509
02:24:45,290 --> 02:24:47,300
a little boy and so he goes a long ways.

2510
02:24:47,680 --> 02:24:50,890
I was amazed that, I mean when we
were in Wisconsin, we shot that deer.

2511
02:24:50,891 --> 02:24:53,800
How hard it is to drag a deer.
Wasn't even a big deer.

2512
02:24:53,801 --> 02:24:56,800
What'd that deer way that I shot
130 pounds or something maybe.

2513
02:24:57,040 --> 02:25:01,150
Oh maybe a little more than that. I would
say, okay, let me go there. Maybe 150 no,

2514
02:25:01,151 --> 02:25:05,230
the other one, the one in Wisconsin,
so we're dragging it down. I'm like,

2515
02:25:05,320 --> 02:25:08,560
this is fucking exhausting. This
is a little, it is two of us.

2516
02:25:08,900 --> 02:25:13,210
There's two of us dragging this little
deer. I'm like, God damn fucking Mousse.

2517
02:25:14,280 --> 02:25:16,780
That's crazy. I think solo is
impressive in a lot of ways.

2518
02:25:16,781 --> 02:25:19,590
I think the camera works in pressing
it for them. If Remy wasn't the,

2519
02:25:19,610 --> 02:25:24,100
the hunter duty was I'd hire him to be
my camera man cause he's better. Most

2520
02:25:24,100 --> 02:25:24,581
people.
Well,

2521
02:25:24,581 --> 02:25:28,060
you also have an artistic perspective
on it that I thought was really unusual

2522
02:25:28,061 --> 02:25:29,710
and I didn't expect,
and watching the show,

2523
02:25:29,711 --> 02:25:33,220
we talked about macro shots and you know,

2524
02:25:33,580 --> 02:25:35,140
really close ups of putting this,

2525
02:25:35,141 --> 02:25:38,480
pulling arrows out of the ground and
seeing flowers and distance shot.

2526
02:25:38,740 --> 02:25:40,960
It's very artistic as well as being,

2527
02:25:41,640 --> 02:25:44,220
see, that's it. I, I liked doing
it because it's like I'm kind of,

2528
02:25:44,290 --> 02:25:47,240
I'm a creative guy. I like
designing things and being creative.

2529
02:25:47,241 --> 02:25:51,380
And so it's a way for me to like tell the
story of exactly what's happening with

2530
02:25:51,381 --> 02:25:55,670
no filters, nobody else's there. I'm
filming, it's my story. It's my world.

2531
02:25:55,910 --> 02:25:59,690
Like that's the closest way to get into
my brain, you know what I mean? Because,

2532
02:26:00,570 --> 02:26:03,980
and obviously like things get
edited too, you know? But I'm like,

2533
02:26:04,250 --> 02:26:07,540
I film what I like, you know, and so, and,

2534
02:26:07,541 --> 02:26:10,640
and I think like as it's grown and you'll
see more and more of that because I

2535
02:26:10,641 --> 02:26:12,980
like every bit of nature,
you know?

2536
02:26:13,250 --> 02:26:16,460
So I think you're going to see like an
adventure. You're going to see, you know,

2537
02:26:16,790 --> 02:26:19,050
plants and animals and all kinds.
So

2538
02:26:19,160 --> 02:26:23,570
who does the, um, the production, uh,
Tim does a production, like he edited,

2539
02:26:23,571 --> 02:26:26,800
said he does everything. So it's
a two man show. Yeah, exactly.

2540
02:26:26,870 --> 02:26:29,000
Sometimes a one man show
when it's his show, right?

2541
02:26:29,030 --> 02:26:30,470
Like it was him getting a moose.

2542
02:26:30,500 --> 02:26:33,950
He does the whole thing and he
designed this show. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2543
02:26:34,100 --> 02:26:35,930
It's fucking great show again.

2544
02:26:35,931 --> 02:26:40,180
Another thing that's great about it is
this is zero redneck aspect to it. Yeah.

2545
02:26:40,270 --> 02:26:44,960
We try la can't believe. Here
we are again. Well, well man,

2546
02:26:44,961 --> 02:26:49,160
I'll tell you what, Alaska, I'll tell
you would, Alaska is a beautiful,

2547
02:26:49,780 --> 02:26:54,780
they're up for some awards to our show
or they should base is that for this

2548
02:26:54,920 --> 02:26:58,430
week? The shot show that'll be at shot
show this week. What is shot? Stand for?

2549
02:26:59,150 --> 02:27:03,950
Don't know. Something,
something, something and som
thing. He something hunting.

2550
02:27:03,980 --> 02:27:08,000
It's tactical and hunting.
Shooting, hunting, outdoor
trade. Guns. Sing. That's it.

2551
02:27:08,270 --> 02:27:11,840
Are we still going to try to do a
bunch of episodes of media this year?

2552
02:27:11,900 --> 02:27:14,930
I'll do four of them. I got
some propositions for you,
man. What do you want to do?

2553
02:27:15,320 --> 02:27:17,090
You say what you want to
do and I'll make it happen.

2554
02:27:17,150 --> 02:27:21,320
I want to do whatever we can do. Let's
do it. I'm not even interested in money.

2555
02:27:21,380 --> 02:27:24,200
I'm just what? I'm trying to have
fun. Well, at this point in my life,

2556
02:27:24,201 --> 02:27:29,060
this is what I want to do. I want to, I
like hunting. I do a lot of exciting shit.

2557
02:27:29,150 --> 02:27:29,421
I mean,

2558
02:27:29,421 --> 02:27:33,620
my whole life has been exciting shit from
martial arts to doing stand up comedy,

2559
02:27:33,621 --> 02:27:36,680
working for the UFC.
So I know what exciting shit is.

2560
02:27:36,710 --> 02:27:39,830
So when I get into hunting and
I'm fucking like, this is crazy.

2561
02:27:39,831 --> 02:27:43,300
This is even more exciting than I'm
used to be excited, you know? That's,

2562
02:27:43,310 --> 02:27:44,840
that's how exciting.
Let's do it.

2563
02:27:44,841 --> 02:27:47,690
You come up with your dream list of what
you want to do and the other thing that

2564
02:27:47,691 --> 02:27:50,180
I want to do is,
I don't know if it's a show,

2565
02:27:50,181 --> 02:27:51,590
I don't know if it's
just part of meat eater,

2566
02:27:51,591 --> 02:27:53,720
but I want to teach people how to hunt.

2567
02:27:54,650 --> 02:27:59,240
I want to do it like a how to thing
like first blood write a passage,

2568
02:27:59,250 --> 02:28:03,710
something just like taking people on
their first hunts. Explaining the skills.

2569
02:28:03,711 --> 02:28:07,250
I think people would absolutely love that.
I think it'd be entertained. I think,

2570
02:28:07,251 --> 02:28:07,371
well,

2571
02:28:07,371 --> 02:28:10,670
I think that was one of the
more interesting aspects
of the first episode that I

2572
02:28:10,671 --> 02:28:11,504
did with you guys.

2573
02:28:11,810 --> 02:28:15,590
One of the things that I've
found interesting is like
the first episode, boy,

2574
02:28:15,591 --> 02:28:19,100
when I was about to shoot that deer,
I was fucking tweaking.

2575
02:28:19,520 --> 02:28:23,900
My heart was pounding. I was, I was trying
to stay calm. It was so nerve wracking.

2576
02:28:24,080 --> 02:28:28,550
I had only shot a rifle
maybe five times before that.

2577
02:28:28,580 --> 02:28:32,960
Like literally I shot Steve's rifle
five times, two days before that,

2578
02:28:33,470 --> 02:28:37,460
you know, and this animals 200 yards
away and I'm trying to stay calm.

2579
02:28:37,790 --> 02:28:42,590
The second deer was like an
assassination. There was no, no heartbeat.

2580
02:28:42,620 --> 02:28:44,570
There was no weirdness.
There was no,

2581
02:28:44,780 --> 02:28:49,780
but I had shot 90 rounds the two days
before and 20 rounds of the day before of

2582
02:28:51,420 --> 02:28:54,410
of 300 win mag, so it was
just boom, boom, boom.

2583
02:28:54,590 --> 02:28:57,680
I was so locked in on
just shooting something.

2584
02:28:57,770 --> 02:29:00,980
See what's going to happen to you is
what happens like two most hunters is

2585
02:29:00,981 --> 02:29:03,620
you're going to do this for a while,
right? And you're going to be like,

2586
02:29:03,890 --> 02:29:07,620
what's next? And you're going to
go bow hunting and his elbow. It's,

2587
02:29:08,240 --> 02:29:11,810
it's a new world. Yeah. I'm sure. I
just got a blockchain. It's crazy.

2588
02:29:11,900 --> 02:29:15,110
I just picked up one last week.
I got a biotech experience.

2589
02:29:15,200 --> 02:29:19,310
I set up targets in my backyard. It's fun
to shoot to fuck. Yeah, it's exciting.

2590
02:29:19,311 --> 02:29:22,520
This is the discipline of archery.
Yeah. But I mean it's like the most,

2591
02:29:22,521 --> 02:29:25,430
when you're stocking animals,
like in being close, I mean,

2592
02:29:25,431 --> 02:29:29,030
it's the most Predator prey
primal thing you can do.

2593
02:29:29,420 --> 02:29:33,590
How much elk hunting do you do with bow
and Arrow? Oh, I mean, that's pretty much,

2594
02:29:33,850 --> 02:29:37,760
that's your thing. Well, I
personally am a bow hunter. Um,

2595
02:29:37,820 --> 02:29:40,910
I started like rifle hunting
again just because filming myself,

2596
02:29:40,911 --> 02:29:42,800
bow hunting was near
impossible in some cities

2597
02:29:42,820 --> 02:29:47,590
equations. And I still do it like
it's stupid, but um, I still do it.

2598
02:29:47,591 --> 02:29:50,850
But I mean my thing is bow hunting and,
and that's why like this,

2599
02:29:51,010 --> 02:29:55,120
this new Apex Predator show, I'm like
if I'm going to be hunting something,

2600
02:29:55,150 --> 02:30:00,150
it will be with a bow with my hands
or with a spear pretty much with very

2601
02:30:00,161 --> 02:30:03,430
specific, very specific learning
about like long distance.

2602
02:30:03,580 --> 02:30:05,740
So like Archer Fish Shit.
I mean where are,

2603
02:30:05,741 --> 02:30:08,410
we can talk about something
like [inaudible] and you
can even throw some input

2604
02:30:08,411 --> 02:30:11,570
because some of these we haven't
even decided on, but there is a,

2605
02:30:11,571 --> 02:30:13,420
a fish called an archer fish,
right?

2606
02:30:13,690 --> 02:30:16,630
And this fish is a master of ballistics.

2607
02:30:16,780 --> 02:30:20,440
So like this would be one of the rare
episodes where we use a rifle. Like we,

2608
02:30:20,650 --> 02:30:25,650
we look at this archer fish and this thing
will shoot a stream of water like six

2609
02:30:26,321 --> 02:30:31,321
feet or more and knock these little bugs
off and they are compensating for the

2610
02:30:31,511 --> 02:30:36,420
drop of the water.
And the reflection of the,

2611
02:30:36,880 --> 02:30:40,960
this is a crazy collection of everything.
They're like, they're the math,

2612
02:30:41,950 --> 02:30:46,930
they're like masters of ballistics.
And by the time they get to adult level,

2613
02:30:46,960 --> 02:30:51,900
they're one shot kills. Most of them look
at this. That's amazing. It's amazing

2614
02:30:52,290 --> 02:30:56,060
bidding and knocking birds off of
twigs and then they eat it. Yeah.

2615
02:30:56,280 --> 02:30:58,860
Nature is a motherfucker dude.
So

2616
02:30:59,360 --> 02:31:00,300
that's the like the cool,

2617
02:31:00,330 --> 02:31:04,130
that's why I'm so pumped about
this APEC show is because I just,

2618
02:31:04,320 --> 02:31:07,140
I love nature and I love what
it can teach us. You know,

2619
02:31:07,320 --> 02:31:12,150
I look at it like human hunters
are at the top of the food chain.

2620
02:31:12,151 --> 02:31:16,170
Like, but how did we get there? You
know? So this show, like this new show,

2621
02:31:16,171 --> 02:31:18,720
the Apex Predator show
is not me being an apex.

2622
02:31:18,721 --> 02:31:23,030
Better my quest to see how we
became an apex Predator. You know?

2623
02:31:23,160 --> 02:31:27,930
So I'm going to like look at every bit
of nature and in some way we've adapted.

2624
02:31:27,931 --> 02:31:30,990
I mean you look at like a simple moth
camouflage itself and then look at all

2625
02:31:30,991 --> 02:31:35,991
modern camouflage comes from the way
that we saw moths side or you know,

2626
02:31:36,790 --> 02:31:40,460
I mean there's like lions walk quietly.
And so we're,

2627
02:31:40,500 --> 02:31:43,060
we're thinking about doing
this episode where I,

2628
02:31:43,200 --> 02:31:46,950
I train hard and my feet and then go
in the Sonoran desert and hunt barefoot

2629
02:31:46,980 --> 02:31:50,490
like a mountain lion
would most excited for is,

2630
02:31:50,491 --> 02:31:54,690
is learning how a crocodile can stay
still and like submerge yourself onto it.

2631
02:31:54,830 --> 02:31:57,570
So the thing is that I'm so jealous
about Remy getting to do this,

2632
02:31:57,571 --> 02:32:00,680
that I have to do it along
with them because otherwise
I'd just do jealous about,

2633
02:32:00,681 --> 02:32:02,320
you got to get in the
water as well and do that.

2634
02:32:02,660 --> 02:32:07,410
We're going to submerge
underwater and then grab a pig.

2635
02:32:07,980 --> 02:32:11,840
Oh my God. You're going to
try to grab a pick that, yeah.

2636
02:32:11,850 --> 02:32:16,250
Just like your fingers son. Oh
my God. The waterhole. Just like,

2637
02:32:16,440 --> 02:32:21,000
like an alligator crocodile one. Wow.
Have you seen this video of this? Fuck,

2638
02:32:21,910 --> 02:32:25,800
there's this video of this Jaguar
swimming across then grabbing this Cayman.

2639
02:32:27,660 --> 02:32:32,370
We need to do that episode. Just like
Bam. I mean, that's, that's cool.

2640
02:32:32,380 --> 02:32:36,390
Yeah, that'd be careful
that you're not a Jaguar.

2641
02:32:37,620 --> 02:32:40,800
That's, that's the point though.
I mean, you know, it's like we,

2642
02:32:40,830 --> 02:32:44,940
we can look at nature and it's,
it's like one of these things,

2643
02:32:44,941 --> 02:32:48,300
it's like it can teach us so much and
I think it has in the past that we just

2644
02:32:48,301 --> 02:32:49,410
don't know about it.
You know?

2645
02:32:49,800 --> 02:32:53,790
I mean you look at like how wolves hunted
and then you look at these tribes that

2646
02:32:53,940 --> 02:32:57,990
hunt very similarly and you know, it's
like they had to have learned it somehow.

2647
02:32:58,440 --> 02:33:02,280
You know? And I think like looking
at nature, learning these things, um,

2648
02:33:02,520 --> 02:33:03,353
it just makes a,

2649
02:33:03,420 --> 02:33:07,350
it's like put us in the spot to where
we are where we don't have predators,

2650
02:33:07,590 --> 02:33:12,590
but dragging a pig into the
water seems fraught with peril.

2651
02:33:12,780 --> 02:33:17,250
Yeah, it does. The idea of
sneaking up on a pig in the water,

2652
02:33:18,450 --> 02:33:22,710
they're fucked. Terrible.
They smell everything too.
Right. That's, that's where,

2653
02:33:22,711 --> 02:33:23,011
I mean,

2654
02:33:23,011 --> 02:33:26,910
that's where like alligators
and crocodiles have the
advantage because they move,

2655
02:33:26,911 --> 02:33:30,210
they like the pigs don't even know that
they're there. They just like a log,

2656
02:33:30,600 --> 02:33:35,130
you know? And then they're grabbed by
surprise when he was cat and pulled in.

2657
02:33:35,190 --> 02:33:38,310
Boom.
Cats are such evil fucks.

2658
02:33:39,240 --> 02:33:42,820
They really are busy. So when you shot a
mountain line, did you eat it? Oh yeah.

2659
02:33:42,890 --> 02:33:47,280
Yeah. What does that taste like? Pork.
And it's like the closest wild animal.

2660
02:33:47,281 --> 02:33:50,290
The pork, even wild pork is in
his porky smell. Mine. Well,

2661
02:33:50,410 --> 02:33:53,250
how much of it do you eat? Eat the whole
layout. Yeah, you can eat the whole thing,

2662
02:33:53,280 --> 02:33:55,710
the legs, everything or
whatever. Those are the legs.

2663
02:33:57,030 --> 02:34:00,900
The legs are darker meat. Um, but I,

2664
02:34:01,170 --> 02:34:04,620
I was actually out Chickering last there
this weekend and this guy was telling

2665
02:34:04,621 --> 02:34:09,621
me that I'm some dude makes like I
don't some Chili Con Carne Aa in this

2666
02:34:11,281 --> 02:34:15,150
national festival and really secretly
uses mountain lion meat and wins every

2667
02:34:15,151 --> 02:34:19,220
time. Wow. I hate multiplied.
Once I had burgers,

2668
02:34:19,390 --> 02:34:23,110
a buddy brought me a couple of packages
and that same night I had a dream that I

2669
02:34:23,111 --> 02:34:23,580
was getting

2670
02:34:23,580 --> 02:34:28,320
and by a mountain. Right. Wow.

2671
02:34:28,321 --> 02:34:30,630
That's a weird thing.
So if it tastes that good,

2672
02:34:30,631 --> 02:34:32,220
why don't more people
hunting mountain lions?

2673
02:34:33,000 --> 02:34:37,260
It's not easy. I mean, incredibly
hard. The hardest thing to do. Yeah.

2674
02:34:37,830 --> 02:34:40,530
Yeah. It's specialized at the
most. I mean, what's more elusive?

2675
02:34:40,560 --> 02:34:43,320
There's probably something more elusive.
But in North America you don't,

2676
02:34:43,321 --> 02:34:47,190
nobody sees mountain lions. Naturally.
You don't, you didn't see them.

2677
02:34:47,630 --> 02:34:51,330
And if you do, it's like it's a
freaky moment. Yeah. So we're, I mean,

2678
02:34:51,620 --> 02:34:56,060
it is weird that a big cat that just
runs around killing things with its face

2679
02:34:56,450 --> 02:34:57,283
just

2680
02:34:57,520 --> 02:35:01,630
lives amongst us. You know, like
in North America, we're pretty,

2681
02:35:01,631 --> 02:35:04,000
I've spent a lot of time in
Africa and like in North America,

2682
02:35:04,001 --> 02:35:08,440
the animals disposition is fear of humans,
you know?

2683
02:35:08,500 --> 02:35:09,970
Whereas like in Africa,

2684
02:35:09,971 --> 02:35:14,410
there's so much competition that
large predators are more aggressive.

2685
02:35:14,770 --> 02:35:18,820
Um, so you know, like a mountain
line would be so lethal,

2686
02:35:18,970 --> 02:35:21,930
but they just are, they're
afraid, you know, they,

2687
02:35:22,300 --> 02:35:27,300
they don't see humans normally as food
unless it's like rare circumstance.

2688
02:35:27,730 --> 02:35:32,260
Mountain Lion. Yeah, yeah,
exactly. Or you know what I mean?

2689
02:35:32,590 --> 02:35:36,880
Like it's mostly like women and children
that get attacked by mountain lions.

2690
02:35:36,881 --> 02:35:41,230
You know? I mean, it's just one of those
things that they aren't that aggressive.

2691
02:35:41,231 --> 02:35:43,360
Even when they're like chased or whatever,

2692
02:35:43,660 --> 02:35:47,080
they try to be reclusive and don't
attack you. Like a wounded mount line is,

2693
02:35:47,140 --> 02:35:51,970
isn't first instinct to attack. It's,
which is like a wounded leopards.

2694
02:35:51,971 --> 02:35:56,410
First instinct is attack, you know,
which is completely different.

2695
02:35:57,390 --> 02:36:00,930
Yeah. Fuck cats dude. That's
all I had to say to fuck cats.

2696
02:36:01,630 --> 02:36:03,570
Cats creep me out.
They really do.

2697
02:36:03,780 --> 02:36:06,090
They creep me out because they
tried to catch it from behind.

2698
02:36:06,091 --> 02:36:07,590
They're sneaking up on you.
Is this,

2699
02:36:07,591 --> 02:36:10,650
that one that they spotted
in Hollywood is fucking cat.

2700
02:36:10,651 --> 02:36:12,300
They've spotted him in
the Hollywood hills.

2701
02:36:12,720 --> 02:36:16,530
They got him on game cameras and shit.
That's a big fucking cat to look at.

2702
02:36:16,531 --> 02:36:21,150
That thing. Yeah. Is He collared?
Yeah. He's collared. Yeah.

2703
02:36:21,210 --> 02:36:23,960
But they, these are recent pictures
that they've taken of him, uh,

2704
02:36:24,040 --> 02:36:28,650
in Griffith Park. Right where the
Hollywood sign is fucking blind.

2705
02:36:28,980 --> 02:36:32,210
Big One too big. 150 pounder.
What point is he like, mm,

2706
02:36:32,220 --> 02:36:36,930
that hiker looks good whenever he
gets running out of rabbits, cats,

2707
02:36:36,931 --> 02:36:40,290
rabbits, dogs, all that
kind of shit. Yeah.

2708
02:36:40,291 --> 02:36:45,291
It's an interesting thing when you know
you have encroaching cities and you

2709
02:36:45,421 --> 02:36:46,100
know, the, the,

2710
02:36:46,100 --> 02:36:50,130
the urban sprawl starts making its way
into these territories and you started

2711
02:36:50,131 --> 02:36:54,990
having to deal with the consequences of
a crossing the feeding grounds of these

2712
02:36:54,991 --> 02:36:57,880
animals. Yeah. It gets,
it gets weird, you know,

2713
02:36:58,050 --> 02:37:00,210
with bears it gets weird with cats.

2714
02:37:01,830 --> 02:37:03,260
Yeah.
It's like one of those,

2715
02:37:03,261 --> 02:37:07,070
it's one of those weird things that you
deal with because, you know, I've never,

2716
02:37:07,130 --> 02:37:08,810
I mean I kind of associate myself with,

2717
02:37:08,840 --> 02:37:13,550
I mean I sleep a lot on the ground or
wherever and it's like in that situation,

2718
02:37:13,670 --> 02:37:16,310
you know, you feel like
you're in their, so

2719
02:37:16,400 --> 02:37:19,430
it's like just part of it. But when
they come into a city it's like, oh,

2720
02:37:19,520 --> 02:37:23,450
in our world we can there. But
really it's like, no, he just,

2721
02:37:23,480 --> 02:37:26,030
we just can't stay away.
You know?

2722
02:37:26,031 --> 02:37:29,240
He's just moved our little
communities out there and we're,

2723
02:37:29,500 --> 02:37:33,950
we're putting this nice fluffy dinner out
in front of them every night. You know,

2724
02:37:33,951 --> 02:37:36,410
it's, it's hard for them to say now. Yeah.

2725
02:37:36,411 --> 02:37:39,450
One of them got shot in Santa
Monica a couple of years ago. Yeah,

2726
02:37:39,500 --> 02:37:42,860
I heard that 90 pound cat and
someone's backyard. Really? Yeah.

2727
02:37:43,070 --> 02:37:46,840
And they found it in the backyard and
they uh, they had to shoot it. Yeah.

2728
02:37:47,370 --> 02:37:50,560
Santa Monica. Man,
that's, that's, that's uh,

2729
02:37:50,640 --> 02:37:52,940
I mean it's had a walk through
a lot of streets to get there.

2730
02:37:52,941 --> 02:37:55,340
That's not the outskirts.
The other thing too is what's it,

2731
02:37:55,370 --> 02:37:58,640
I mean it has to be eating
pets or something because
it's only there if it has

2732
02:37:58,641 --> 02:38:01,970
food and it's, how long is it going to
survive? I mean like you look around,

2733
02:38:01,971 --> 02:38:06,590
it was like one dessert, eat
here or do homeless people.

2734
02:38:06,860 --> 02:38:09,380
I'm surprised like, you know,
people sleeping out at night.

2735
02:38:09,670 --> 02:38:13,070
If there is a cat and I don't know,
they'd probably smells so fucking bad.

2736
02:38:13,071 --> 02:38:16,250
The cats like I'm not going
to eat this guy, just cut me.

2737
02:38:16,251 --> 02:38:18,740
And maybe a bear would eat them
because bears eat human shit.

2738
02:38:19,130 --> 02:38:21,110
I think it's a lot of work for
a mountain lion to eat a human.

2739
02:38:21,111 --> 02:38:25,770
I think that's why they don't do it
really. A lot of work to catch us or to,

2740
02:38:25,840 --> 02:38:30,230
I dunno, I guess that's
just an assumption. I have
that here. Here's the thing,

2741
02:38:30,231 --> 02:38:33,350
those humans are the only
predators that stand, right?

2742
02:38:33,770 --> 02:38:38,090
Every animal on the planet knows
that the Human Predator profile,

2743
02:38:38,630 --> 02:38:43,070
you know, like, um, like when you're,
when you're stocking and deer or whatever,

2744
02:38:43,071 --> 02:38:48,050
trying to sneak out and
like get real close. Like Bo
distance, you don't stand up,

2745
02:38:48,110 --> 02:38:51,950
you crawl. Because sometimes I'll look
at you crawling and it's not a threat.

2746
02:38:52,460 --> 02:38:56,390
But if you stand up and give like that
profile, they know you're a predator.

2747
02:38:56,391 --> 02:38:59,540
Even like in Africa, you know,
if you, if you see aligning,

2748
02:38:59,840 --> 02:39:02,090
you let it see you're human profile,

2749
02:39:02,900 --> 02:39:07,250
they high tail it because they know that's
not right. That's, that's our predator.

2750
02:39:07,550 --> 02:39:12,260
You know? Well, that's also think, um,
there's a study recently that they, uh,

2751
02:39:12,290 --> 02:39:15,230
they published a report about it
in the Telegraph today. Actually,

2752
02:39:15,231 --> 02:39:16,370
I put it on my Twitter page.

2753
02:39:16,700 --> 02:39:20,720
That memories can be passed down to later
generations through genetic switches

2754
02:39:20,721 --> 02:39:25,400
that allow the offspring to inherit the
experience of their ancestors according

2755
02:39:25,401 --> 02:39:28,160
to new research.
That makes plain how phobias can develop.

2756
02:39:28,580 --> 02:39:30,800
So if you think about animals,

2757
02:39:31,040 --> 02:39:35,540
I mean every animal in North
America's ancestors got killed by us.

2758
02:39:35,900 --> 02:39:38,960
Every fucking deer, every,
every mountain line,

2759
02:39:38,961 --> 02:39:41,720
every bear they see as fuck that,
that,

2760
02:39:41,810 --> 02:39:44,180
that switch goes off that genetic switch.

2761
02:39:44,540 --> 02:39:49,070
And they just peel out of it the same
way everyone's afraid of big crazy teeth.

2762
02:39:49,100 --> 02:39:52,750
You know, even little kids that have never
experienced monsters before. Serpents,

2763
02:39:52,751 --> 02:39:55,400
snakes, spiders, all those.

2764
02:39:55,401 --> 02:39:58,940
And they think that that might be the
root of things like irrational ones like

2765
02:39:58,941 --> 02:40:01,010
Arachnophobia,
affiliate phobia,

2766
02:40:01,250 --> 02:40:05,470
fear of spiders and snakes and
then just heights, you know,

2767
02:40:05,730 --> 02:40:08,350
the weird ones so that like
they might have been, you know,

2768
02:40:08,480 --> 02:40:11,930
just a memory that stuck in the
DNA. Yeah. Cause that's always like,

2769
02:40:12,110 --> 02:40:14,310
you think about like the
snakes that have certain

2770
02:40:14,310 --> 02:40:16,270
colorations and animals
know not to touch him.

2771
02:40:16,300 --> 02:40:20,280
Then there's other animals that sim like
are similar to those colorations and

2772
02:40:20,281 --> 02:40:22,560
then don't get touched somewhere along
the line. Everything needs to know that.

2773
02:40:22,561 --> 02:40:26,490
Like that's poisonous.
Yeah. Yeah. No Shit.

2774
02:40:26,520 --> 02:40:27,460
What is, um, uh,

2775
02:40:27,600 --> 02:40:32,010
have you ever had a situation
where you were in a,

2776
02:40:32,070 --> 02:40:33,060
like a,

2777
02:40:33,190 --> 02:40:37,230
a place where you shot an animal and
you were trying to get it out of there,

2778
02:40:37,380 --> 02:40:40,530
but some predators were moving in
and making a play on the animal,

2779
02:40:40,531 --> 02:40:42,450
like wolves or anything along those lines?

2780
02:40:42,720 --> 02:40:44,260
Yeah, I had a client shoot a, um,

2781
02:40:44,310 --> 02:40:48,870
an elk once with a bow and a it ran off
and it took us a while to find it and

2782
02:40:48,871 --> 02:40:53,050
when we came up to it, um, like a
bear and claimed it and so it was a,

2783
02:40:54,420 --> 02:40:58,260
and then we'll kind of bear black
bear and the big black bear and uh,

2784
02:40:58,430 --> 02:41:01,530
it and it just scaring it off,
you know? And it didn't really,

2785
02:41:02,110 --> 02:41:02,881
didn't really do anything.

2786
02:41:02,881 --> 02:41:06,510
But most of the time human
scent is a pretty big deterrent.

2787
02:41:07,110 --> 02:41:10,710
Animals don't like the way we smell, you
know, if you can get your center around,

2788
02:41:10,760 --> 02:41:13,920
they're gone. That's
interesting. Generally speaking,

2789
02:41:13,921 --> 02:41:17,480
and this bear this fall
actually attract us by scent.

2790
02:41:17,910 --> 02:41:22,140
Oh. But generally I can get you in
that and they'll, they'll go away.

2791
02:41:22,260 --> 02:41:26,330
Now when you go bow hunting, do you
bring a gun or anything just in case? Uh,

2792
02:41:26,370 --> 02:41:31,000
no I don't. And uh, that's like my, maybe
you just like I were talking earlier,

2793
02:41:31,030 --> 02:41:34,560
just like getting complacent.
I, I forgo a lot of safety nets.

2794
02:41:34,590 --> 02:41:37,390
Just the travel light. Yeah. You know,

2795
02:41:37,410 --> 02:41:40,800
I forgo like a lot of things
like in a lot of trips, man,

2796
02:41:40,801 --> 02:41:43,320
I won't even bring enough food.
Yeah, I saw that. Yeah, that was,

2797
02:41:43,321 --> 02:41:44,880
I was next question was going to ask you,

2798
02:41:44,881 --> 02:41:48,930
you tried to just shoot things and
eat them all the way? Yeah. Yeah.

2799
02:41:48,931 --> 02:41:51,270
I mean like it's kind of like
one of those things for me,

2800
02:41:51,271 --> 02:41:54,360
it's like part of the adventure part of
the trip and it's also like a personal

2801
02:41:54,361 --> 02:41:58,080
experience. Um, I mean there is
one hunting. I mean, you know,

2802
02:41:58,081 --> 02:42:01,710
I like mention it like on say it was a
solo hundred whatever, I'll mention it,

2803
02:42:01,711 --> 02:42:04,710
but I don't play it up in the show
because it's like, I don't know,

2804
02:42:04,770 --> 02:42:08,610
I mean it's almost like too dramatic and
playing things up that don't make any

2805
02:42:08,611 --> 02:42:11,280
sense to most people.
So it's just my personal thing.

2806
02:42:11,640 --> 02:42:13,680
Like there was one deer hunt.
We're literally,

2807
02:42:13,681 --> 02:42:18,681
I s I was starving and I was going
probably 3000 vertical or more a day,

2808
02:42:19,650 --> 02:42:22,890
lots of miles over
12,000 feet in elevation.

2809
02:42:22,891 --> 02:42:26,580
I mean my body was eating
itself and it was really weird.

2810
02:42:26,581 --> 02:42:31,470
I mean yeah was something weird to talk
about but like there was nothing left.

2811
02:42:31,471 --> 02:42:33,510
It was just like you had
to go to the bathroom.

2812
02:42:33,511 --> 02:42:36,600
It was just like mucus coming
out, you know, just like white.

2813
02:42:36,630 --> 02:42:39,540
It's like spit it just be like
spitting like no, just water, nothing,

2814
02:42:40,230 --> 02:42:43,620
absolutely nothing. And you know,
you feel the ill effects of it.

2815
02:42:43,680 --> 02:42:47,730
But for me it's like okay that's part
of it. Like hunting, like you're hungry.

2816
02:42:47,731 --> 02:42:52,700
And I think for apex we're going to do it.
I want to do a hunt where um,

2817
02:42:52,830 --> 02:42:56,130
cause cause we hunted, we, each episode
we're setting up like an experiment.

2818
02:42:56,310 --> 02:43:00,270
So there's a lot of hunt science involves
a lot of science involved. And uh,

2819
02:43:00,540 --> 02:43:04,440
so what I'm going to do is
do this experiment where
I like fast for three days

2820
02:43:04,770 --> 02:43:06,810
and then do a blind before,
like I'm full.

2821
02:43:07,050 --> 02:43:10,380
I go into a room and then see how
I can pick up since, you know,

2822
02:43:10,381 --> 02:43:12,130
like maybe have like three rooms,
five

2823
02:43:12,130 --> 02:43:16,450
rooms, one has like an animal sent
another food sent to blank, you know,

2824
02:43:16,451 --> 02:43:20,080
see if I can see it or I
mean smell it. And then, um,

2825
02:43:20,081 --> 02:43:22,240
and then like starve
myself for three days,

2826
02:43:22,600 --> 02:43:26,410
which really if like for hunger
isn't that long. And then, um,

2827
02:43:26,440 --> 02:43:29,980
and then see if I can smell things.
I did an article a while,

2828
02:43:30,400 --> 02:43:35,080
probably two years ago. And, uh, like
as we get hungry, our olfactory senses,

2829
02:43:35,081 --> 02:43:38,800
which are our first sense is to develop
our sense of smell is like our first one.

2830
02:43:39,220 --> 02:43:43,600
And as we get hungry, we start noticing
different things. And there's like,

2831
02:43:43,660 --> 02:43:47,110
when you're hungry, you're actually
like doing more exploratory sniffing.

2832
02:43:47,300 --> 02:43:50,830
He was like smelling the air because it's
our first, it's, it's funny, it's like,

2833
02:43:50,831 --> 02:43:53,890
that's our first sent to finding food
because we can find the invisible.

2834
02:43:54,370 --> 02:43:55,210
That totally makes sense.

2835
02:43:55,211 --> 02:43:58,180
And it also makes sense the same way
sex feels better when you haven't gotten

2836
02:43:58,181 --> 02:44:02,170
laid in awhile and you're like, oh this
is great, but if you fucking twice a day,

2837
02:44:02,171 --> 02:44:04,630
every day, like all right,
here we go again. You know,

2838
02:44:04,631 --> 02:44:08,620
like stuff my face with another fucking
cheeseburger or I'm starving to death

2839
02:44:08,621 --> 02:44:11,620
and I smell something amazing. You know
someone's got a pot roast in the oven.

2840
02:44:12,190 --> 02:44:16,570
Oh my God, I haven't eaten in days.
Holy Shit. This smells good. Yeah,

2841
02:44:16,630 --> 02:44:19,900
probably do. That's one of the things I
think that people enjoy about fasting,

2842
02:44:19,901 --> 02:44:22,180
that they don't really talk about it.
Yeah.

2843
02:44:22,181 --> 02:44:23,800
It gives your digestive system a break,

2844
02:44:23,801 --> 02:44:26,920
but it also makes you like
really appreciate the food
for shirts and can finally

2845
02:44:26,921 --> 02:44:29,830
eat the same thing with hunting or hiking
all day. Why to food tastes so good.

2846
02:44:29,831 --> 02:44:31,060
It's just cause when you burn calories,

2847
02:44:31,061 --> 02:44:35,630
you need calories and your
body's just like, yeah, that's
a, that's a big one. The,

2848
02:44:35,650 --> 02:44:39,790
the burning calories, like you want to
stuff your fucking face when you get back.

2849
02:44:39,880 --> 02:44:44,320
You can't eat enough. No.
And fats, you want fats.

2850
02:44:44,320 --> 02:44:47,740
That's the weird things. You find
your body craving fat, animal fat,

2851
02:44:47,990 --> 02:44:49,750
your body wants what it needs,
you know,

2852
02:44:50,160 --> 02:44:53,290
and I think that's going to be a part
of the of it too is I really think that

2853
02:44:53,291 --> 02:44:54,960
that experiment would go well.
Like we'll,

2854
02:44:55,180 --> 02:44:57,670
I'll smell things that I
wouldn't smell when I'm full.

2855
02:44:58,120 --> 02:44:59,770
And then also then we'll go,

2856
02:44:59,920 --> 02:45:04,420
I'll like starve myself and then go
hunting because a large population of

2857
02:45:04,421 --> 02:45:08,800
predators actually don't hunt
until they're starving. Wow. Yeah.

2858
02:45:09,070 --> 02:45:13,780
Like a wolf. The feast or famine, they
just go shoulder gorged starved gorge.

2859
02:45:13,810 --> 02:45:16,930
It's like, it's a really
weird deal. But you know,

2860
02:45:16,931 --> 02:45:20,650
they hunt better when they're hungry.
I know people can hunt wolves now.

2861
02:45:21,250 --> 02:45:24,310
Does anybody eat wolf?
Apparently.

2862
02:45:24,820 --> 02:45:29,470
I mean Steve was telling me and I've
read and like some people say it's like

2863
02:45:29,471 --> 02:45:32,980
there is a few explorers back in the
day. They were like, it's the best thing.

2864
02:45:33,070 --> 02:45:36,140
I think it was Steffenson Steffenson yeah,
yeah. That this is exactly what, what,

2865
02:45:36,190 --> 02:45:36,881
what was the best?

2866
02:45:36,881 --> 02:45:39,340
Maybe cause you fucking hate them because
they're trying to kill you and you

2867
02:45:39,341 --> 02:45:40,720
killed them and then you get to eat them.
Well,

2868
02:45:40,721 --> 02:45:44,180
my guess is he's pretty fucking hungry
when he hit that wall. Pretty good.

2869
02:45:45,250 --> 02:45:49,900
Wow. Wolf would be the imagine if it was
unbelievably delicious. I don't know.

2870
02:45:50,170 --> 02:45:52,600
It's not logical,
but because they're eating other meats,

2871
02:45:52,630 --> 02:45:57,040
generally the sower mountain lions
eat the mountain lion legs.

2872
02:45:57,041 --> 02:46:00,610
He the loins mostly I don't think don't
eat the legs. You can but you don't.

2873
02:46:00,890 --> 02:46:04,750
I think you know, you make it into
like ground some kind of Mexican dish.

2874
02:46:05,050 --> 02:46:07,210
Everything tastes good.
You know why?

2875
02:46:07,240 --> 02:46:09,980
Why would need to like see
the too too muscular? Is that

2876
02:46:09,980 --> 02:46:11,450
what it is? I think so. And just gave me,

2877
02:46:11,550 --> 02:46:14,720
so the loin meaning the muscle
that covers the spine area,

2878
02:46:14,721 --> 02:46:18,080
the extra backstrap that's
the softest for some reason.

2879
02:46:18,180 --> 02:46:19,140
Yeah,
it's the most tender.

2880
02:46:19,141 --> 02:46:23,100
It's still like the largest piece of
meat without any connective tissues or

2881
02:46:23,840 --> 02:46:25,560
ligaments, stuff like that, you know,

2882
02:46:25,561 --> 02:46:29,900
which make it chewy or whatever
and muscles get worked or like,

2883
02:46:29,950 --> 02:46:31,740
like I think of a chicken,
it's like dark meat,

2884
02:46:31,741 --> 02:46:35,760
so you have a difference in your aerobic
and anaerobic muscles and that like the

2885
02:46:35,761 --> 02:46:39,990
amount of blood and oxygen that's put in
there in the amount of use changes like

2886
02:46:39,991 --> 02:46:44,070
the flavor and in meats.
That's why a lot of people like love beef,

2887
02:46:44,071 --> 02:46:47,170
but if you think about the
way those animals are there,

2888
02:46:47,220 --> 02:46:50,580
they were like putting these
lots where they don't move in.

2889
02:46:50,581 --> 02:46:51,500
Their muscles aren't real.

2890
02:46:51,720 --> 02:46:56,490
I mean it's like they tried to make
them all better tasting by not working.

2891
02:46:57,020 --> 02:47:00,740
Yeah. Isn't that fascinating? Like I
think Coby beef tastes gross. Terrible.

2892
02:47:00,860 --> 02:47:02,420
I don't like it.
I I you know,

2893
02:47:02,421 --> 02:47:05,900
someone at a restaurant told me that
I have to try it. It's amazing that,

2894
02:47:05,901 --> 02:47:07,220
you know,
told me the whole process.

2895
02:47:07,221 --> 02:47:10,890
They massage this animal and then they
give it beer and all this different stuff

2896
02:47:10,891 --> 02:47:14,440
to make it okay. It was
a greasy mess. Yeah.

2897
02:47:14,480 --> 02:47:18,080
It was just like dance t greasy disease.
It was like eating an alcoholic.

2898
02:47:18,450 --> 02:47:21,520
People. People always ask me like, what's
the weirdest thing you've ever eaten?

2899
02:47:21,550 --> 02:47:25,120
You know, and I've, I've been like
coyote who knows what you know?

2900
02:47:25,121 --> 02:47:29,940
I've eaten like pretty much most weird
species on the planet raw, you know?

2901
02:47:30,280 --> 02:47:32,500
And I'm like thinking about it.
I'm like Slim Jim.

2902
02:47:35,080 --> 02:47:36,840
Yeah,
that's great.

2903
02:47:37,960 --> 02:47:42,240
It's all Dixon Dixon cow falls.
Yeah.

2904
02:47:42,241 --> 02:47:45,240
Slim Jims are fucking all that
mystery weird shit. We do.

2905
02:47:45,241 --> 02:47:47,160
We package things in a tube forms.

2906
02:47:47,640 --> 02:47:51,300
What strange thing we always
make it look like dicks. No,

2907
02:47:51,750 --> 02:47:54,540
never looks like a Frisbee.
We turn them into Dick's.

2908
02:47:56,160 --> 02:47:57,600
Is it easy to just roll it?

2909
02:47:58,140 --> 02:48:00,980
What's the reason to get mystery
meat and Dick Forum all about?

2910
02:48:01,530 --> 02:48:04,890
It's an old practice though, people than
making sausages for hundreds of years.

2911
02:48:06,090 --> 02:48:09,540
Why we you make sausage and you're like,

2912
02:48:09,541 --> 02:48:13,020
this is the most ridiculous
thing I've ever done. Do you,

2913
02:48:13,021 --> 02:48:17,940
when you make venison sausage, do you
add pork fat to it? Um, sometimes, yeah.

2914
02:48:17,990 --> 02:48:18,750
I think like

2915
02:48:18,750 --> 02:48:21,060
if I, it's something I'm
going to give out or whatever.

2916
02:48:21,061 --> 02:48:23,880
I had pork fat because it gives
it that extra consistency.

2917
02:48:24,000 --> 02:48:27,750
A lot of times on my ground meat. I don't
add anything. I just like it how it is.

2918
02:48:28,170 --> 02:48:31,260
Yeah. This, uh, this
trip, last trip we uh,

2919
02:48:31,290 --> 02:48:33,720
had meat sent to a processor,
a butcher,

2920
02:48:33,721 --> 02:48:36,720
and he turned it into sausage and a bunch
of different things and they added fat

2921
02:48:36,721 --> 02:48:38,400
to it. But this trip, uh,

2922
02:48:38,401 --> 02:48:42,660
we did it ourselves and I didn't add
anything to the ground venison and I just

2923
02:48:42,661 --> 02:48:45,930
cook it with grass fed butter
and garlic salt, just cook it.

2924
02:48:45,970 --> 02:48:50,550
We leave it fairly rare and it's unfucking
believably delicious. It's so good.

2925
02:48:50,820 --> 02:48:55,650
I cook up some Kale and a, and then
I, that's like my favorite new meal,

2926
02:48:55,651 --> 02:48:59,640
ground venison and Kale.
It's fucking sanely good plus tomatoes.

2927
02:48:59,641 --> 02:49:02,670
That's my like favorite meal of all time.
It's like I can eat that twice a day,

2928
02:49:02,671 --> 02:49:05,490
every day, especially if
you grow your own. I've,

2929
02:49:05,550 --> 02:49:08,520
I've been doing that lately
to growing my own cauliflower,

2930
02:49:08,520 --> 02:49:12,870
Broccoli, tomatoes, and my ultimate goal
is to be responsible for all my food,

2931
02:49:12,900 --> 02:49:15,870
all my vegetables and all
and all meat game meat.

2932
02:49:15,990 --> 02:49:19,530
Have you noticed how much more you care
about that food too? It's like insane.

2933
02:49:19,770 --> 02:49:21,270
Like you just think about like you take,

2934
02:49:21,300 --> 02:49:24,660
like when I take an elk stake out or
whatever, I like take it out. I like,

2935
02:49:25,080 --> 02:49:27,300
I like treat it like a baby,
you know what I mean?

2936
02:49:27,301 --> 02:49:30,930
He like d frost that you like
marinate it. You like Miss, you know?

2937
02:49:31,100 --> 02:49:34,170
It was like even with like a tomato
you grow, you like pick it gently,

2938
02:49:34,171 --> 02:49:36,630
like carry it inside and Wa you know,

2939
02:49:36,631 --> 02:49:38,010
and he's like the ones you
get from the grocery store,

2940
02:49:38,011 --> 02:49:41,880
you just throw on the counter in a
bag. Like it doesn't mean shit. Yeah.

2941
02:49:41,881 --> 02:49:45,180
The meaning behind our food is definitely
something that we've lost in our

2942
02:49:45,181 --> 02:49:49,650
transition from hunter gatherers to
this weird sort of agricultural based

2943
02:49:49,651 --> 02:49:53,100
society and not even agriculture where
you're connected to the agriculture.

2944
02:49:53,100 --> 02:49:56,700
We just go to a place given paper and
they give you the fruits of their labor.

2945
02:49:57,180 --> 02:50:00,750
It's weird. Yeah. Yeah. You put it really
well. I think this last time in Wisconsin,

2946
02:50:00,751 --> 02:50:03,810
just about the weirdness we have here
in this country about about just meat in

2947
02:50:03,811 --> 02:50:07,350
general. The consumption is consumption
of it. See, it's weird. It's, it's,

2948
02:50:07,351 --> 02:50:11,910
there's a disconnect that goes quite deep
that, uh, you know, we're looking at it.

2949
02:50:11,911 --> 02:50:14,250
People are looking at, I think
it's being recognized, but it's,

2950
02:50:14,630 --> 02:50:16,230
it's pretty fun to think about like,

2951
02:50:16,560 --> 02:50:19,020
the people that live a
long time on this planet,

2952
02:50:19,380 --> 02:50:24,000
they're all people that eat food from
where they're at. You know what I mean?

2953
02:50:24,240 --> 02:50:29,240
There's just something to be said for
people that eat things that are from where

2954
02:50:29,671 --> 02:50:30,660
they are.
You know,

2955
02:50:30,661 --> 02:50:33,690
it's like if you have deer
in your backyard and things
that you can grow around

2956
02:50:33,691 --> 02:50:36,990
there, there's just something to be said
for having that kind of diet. You know,

2957
02:50:36,991 --> 02:50:41,991
I think it's like weird for humans to eat
a orange from South America anytime of

2958
02:50:43,291 --> 02:50:46,450
the year, you know? I don't
know. Well, I think it's,

2959
02:50:46,500 --> 02:50:50,310
I would love to see some sort of a study
on the nutritional aspects of wild game

2960
02:50:50,311 --> 02:50:54,000
over or over beef and what,
what they are. I mean,

2961
02:50:54,001 --> 02:50:58,080
I know you said that the elk has very
low cholesterol and comparison to Evan

2962
02:50:58,081 --> 02:51:02,910
chicken per gram. Well elks,
um, even more so than venison,

2963
02:51:02,940 --> 02:51:07,830
but um, or deer, a lot of people call it
venison or whatever, but um, yeah, the,

2964
02:51:07,831 --> 02:51:11,720
the amount of protein per
gram is like double in, uh,

2965
02:51:11,890 --> 02:51:16,110
in game meat as well. Really? Yeah. So
you get more protein, less cholesterol,

2966
02:51:16,111 --> 02:51:16,471
less fat.

2967
02:51:16,471 --> 02:51:21,180
Because think about it while the animal's
store their fat on the outside of

2968
02:51:21,181 --> 02:51:24,420
their muscle because it needs to be
readily accessible so they burn it the

2969
02:51:24,421 --> 02:51:28,670
quickest. Whereas like meat is not
supposed to have fat inside of it.

2970
02:51:28,680 --> 02:51:31,590
It's not supposed to be marbled.
That's something that we've created.

2971
02:51:31,620 --> 02:51:34,860
It's something that we created by
feeding them this high protein,

2972
02:51:34,861 --> 02:51:37,080
corn and everything and
not letting them move.

2973
02:51:37,500 --> 02:51:41,340
So when you eat something where the fat's
inside, that's completely unnatural.

2974
02:51:41,640 --> 02:51:44,340
I mean, you could get any, any
animal marbled like that if you,

2975
02:51:44,400 --> 02:51:45,480
if you treat him the same way,

2976
02:51:45,481 --> 02:51:47,820
but because game animals
keep the fat on the outside,

2977
02:51:48,150 --> 02:51:53,150
there's relatively zero fat inside the
meat itself because it just doesn't make

2978
02:51:53,761 --> 02:51:56,580
sense because they would need to burn
it and they can't access it as quickly.

2979
02:51:56,940 --> 02:51:59,670
So that's why like, and then
if you look at it, well,

2980
02:52:00,120 --> 02:52:04,590
if it's not fat mixed in there, what
is it? What's protein? Pure protein.

2981
02:52:04,870 --> 02:52:06,370
So for the same amount

2982
02:52:06,370 --> 02:52:10,240
of steak that you have for
beef and verse wild game,

2983
02:52:10,241 --> 02:52:12,370
you're gonna have more protein,
less cholesterol, less fat.

2984
02:52:13,110 --> 02:52:16,850
Do you ever worry that
someday that because of the,

2985
02:52:16,851 --> 02:52:20,670
the negative attitudes about hunting
and the sort of disconnect that we

2986
02:52:20,671 --> 02:52:24,600
experience now as opposed to in the past,
just, you know, a hundred years ago,

2987
02:52:24,601 --> 02:52:27,120
this is a massive disconnect
between now and then.

2988
02:52:27,300 --> 02:52:30,360
Do you ever worry that there's gonna
come a day where they will stop hunting?

2989
02:52:30,910 --> 02:52:34,360
Um, yeah. I mean of course you
worry about that, you know,

2990
02:52:34,361 --> 02:52:38,980
but you think about it and maybe I think
that there'll be a lot of resurgence of

2991
02:52:38,981 --> 02:52:41,860
certain things when we kind of,
people would start saying, hey,

2992
02:52:41,861 --> 02:52:44,620
this is really messed up.
This is really messy. I mean,

2993
02:52:44,650 --> 02:52:48,220
everything in our society
changes at some point, you know?

2994
02:52:48,221 --> 02:52:50,080
And for better or worse,
I mean,

2995
02:52:50,380 --> 02:52:54,100
governments are always changing and the
ideas behind things are always changing.

2996
02:52:54,101 --> 02:52:56,170
And you look at like our
food and at some point,

2997
02:52:56,171 --> 02:52:58,960
I mean you're really starting to
see it now where people are like,

2998
02:52:58,961 --> 02:53:02,290
what exactly am I putting into my body?
You know,

2999
02:53:02,291 --> 02:53:06,520
it's kind of like beef.
Actually nobody ate beef.

3000
02:53:06,550 --> 02:53:10,330
Everybody like the original Americans
when beef was around because they would,

3001
02:53:10,540 --> 02:53:14,170
they would drive the cattle from
Texas north before the rail lines.

3002
02:53:14,470 --> 02:53:17,820
And so beef was the game must meet
on the planet. Nobody likes beef.

3003
02:53:18,640 --> 02:53:22,180
And it wasn't until the railcars where
they could ship them up and then put them

3004
02:53:22,181 --> 02:53:25,300
in feed lots that people started
liking beef over game meat.

3005
02:53:25,660 --> 02:53:28,750
So I think that then people would be like,
well why do we actually like this,

3006
02:53:29,010 --> 02:53:30,010
this, you know? And if,

3007
02:53:30,250 --> 02:53:34,270
if people really understood what
they're eating and you know,

3008
02:53:34,271 --> 02:53:38,740
like the benefits of other things,
I think that there's popularity in that.

3009
02:53:38,800 --> 02:53:42,580
But on the flip side,
like is as you've experienced,

3010
02:53:42,610 --> 02:53:44,200
hunting isn't one of those things like,
oh,

3011
02:53:44,201 --> 02:53:47,110
I'm just going to go out and
go hunting. You know? I mean,

3012
02:53:47,111 --> 02:53:50,410
you need somebody to show you. It's
very, it's like a hard thing to do.

3013
02:53:50,411 --> 02:53:52,810
And a lot of people don't
realize that like, uh, you know,

3014
02:53:52,811 --> 02:53:55,780
you might hear this person is
against hunting. Be like, oh,

3015
02:53:55,870 --> 02:53:59,770
how hard is it to go out and kill
something with a rifle? You're like, well,

3016
02:53:59,771 --> 02:54:04,090
to do it the way I do it, like as a
true Predator out in the mountains,

3017
02:54:04,091 --> 02:54:08,080
hunting and stalking. And it's not that
easy as you've seen. I mean, it could be,

3018
02:54:08,370 --> 02:54:11,020
there are a lot of times you
come back with nothing, you know?

3019
02:54:11,150 --> 02:54:11,781
Oh,
no doubt.

3020
02:54:11,781 --> 02:54:15,050
And that's one of the things that I really
appreciate about both meet eater and

3021
02:54:15,051 --> 02:54:19,550
solo hunters is that you guys show
unsuccessful hunts. Yeah. And you know,

3022
02:54:19,551 --> 02:54:23,300
and it's not like you're like all
depressed and it's like, look, you know,

3023
02:54:23,301 --> 02:54:26,840
this is a part of it. It's hunting. It's
not killing. You know, it's not that,

3024
02:54:26,841 --> 02:54:30,110
it's not like you're going to the Penn
finding a cow that you enjoy and shooting

3025
02:54:30,160 --> 02:54:31,300
in the head.
You're,

3026
02:54:31,310 --> 02:54:35,000
you're going out there into its world
and you may or may not be successful.

3027
02:54:35,210 --> 02:54:38,840
And there's a lot of factors
there that those factors, the,

3028
02:54:38,841 --> 02:54:40,850
the lack of success on occasional hunts,

3029
02:54:40,910 --> 02:54:43,550
make the successful
hunts feel even better.

3030
02:54:43,720 --> 02:54:44,553
Yup.

3031
02:54:46,520 --> 02:54:50,790
What a better way to end it. Perfect.
So the show is called Apex Predator. Um,

3032
02:54:50,870 --> 02:54:54,500
you guys are in the middle of negotiation
and you'll keep us updated on what it

3033
02:54:54,501 --> 02:54:55,190
is.

3034
02:54:55,190 --> 02:54:59,090
Let us know who picks it up or what winds
up happening will promote the fuck out

3035
02:54:59,091 --> 02:55:02,990
of that. Uh, Daniel Dodi on
Twitter. Right. And do you have a,

3036
02:55:03,590 --> 02:55:08,060
apparently I do.

3037
02:55:08,210 --> 02:55:12,600

meat eater. Twitter, Steve Rinella.

3040
02:55:20,961 --> 02:55:25,010

going to talk some more with him about

3041
02:55:25,400 --> 02:55:28,820
probably a lot of [inaudible]
same subjects. And we're
also going to go hunting.

3042
