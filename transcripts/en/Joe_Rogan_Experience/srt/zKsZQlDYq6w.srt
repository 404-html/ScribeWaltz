1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,480
Still out,
figure it out later.

2
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:08,170
Two,
one.

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:09,540
Oh,
and with live,

4
00:00:09,541 --> 00:00:10,920
ladies and gentlemen,
with the Creator,

5
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:13,980
are you the creator of this library?
Is Brian Brian?

6
00:00:13,981 --> 00:00:14,920
Yeah.
Not Thinking yet.

7
00:00:14,921 --> 00:00:16,320
He has a god.
I don't go that far.

8
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:16,890
Right?
Brain,

9
00:00:16,891 --> 00:00:18,240
the right brain.
Cheers sir.

10
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:19,530
Thank you sir.
The clink,

11
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:22,050
the famous Yeti Jingle.
A rambler.

12
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:24,570
Ooh,
what a great invention.

13
00:00:24,571 --> 00:00:29,571
How'd you guys will?
You guys were just getting hammered and 

14
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:31,371
throwing anything in there.
Same way for folks who haven't been 

15
00:00:31,371 --> 00:00:32,190
properly introduced.
My friend Ben.

16
00:00:32,191 --> 00:00:33,600
Oh,
is here and he's the one.

17
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:37,500
He was in the podcast from paradise when
we're in Lanai.

18
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:42,480
Kind of my all time favorites.
I mean the island or the podcast thing,

19
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:44,430
but it was all awesome.
The whole damn thing,

20
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:46,380
but people are drinking those cat ladies
now,

21
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:47,720
which is.
It's not to bad.

22
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:51,990
That's terrible idea to dudley making 
that.

23
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:53,880
I was like,
what the fuck are you doing?

24
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:59,480
He Poured Tequila and red bull into a 
glass of red wine and we're looking at 

25
00:00:59,791 --> 00:01:00,430
him like,
what is.

26
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:04,290
And people have.
Hashtags are wrong,

27
00:01:04,291 --> 00:01:05,790
man.
When people are hashtagging,

28
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,310
of course I'd do it sometimes just to 
poke fun at everybody,

29
00:01:08,311 --> 00:01:10,590
but I've had probably a dozen people 
like,

30
00:01:10,591 --> 00:01:15,591
man,
I tried the cat lady last night just 

31
00:01:15,591 --> 00:01:15,970
drinking it,
just to say they drank it in,

32
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:18,390
which is just don't do it.
People don't do it,

33
00:01:18,391 --> 00:01:21,630
but right brain is actually pretty good.
I can get that.

34
00:01:21,631 --> 00:01:23,040
We were,
there were some meat,

35
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:28,041
some trigger,
some bose involved and stuff just got 

36
00:01:28,041 --> 00:01:28,200
put together.
And I've had these before.

37
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:30,880
They actually tastes good.
But um,

38
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:34,190
there's like no benefit that you get 
from our list.

39
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:38,520
It's like all the science,
we put it into Alpha brain,

40
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:41,280
all the non science from whiskey out the
window phones.

41
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:43,250
Totally.
Well,

42
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:48,260
I mean it's a,
he's made zero leaps forward but we're 

43
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:50,310
good where we are currently.
Maybe it my balance us out though.

44
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:54,690
It keeps from getting too stupid,
which that's a,

45
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:58,500
that's a good achievement.
Do big issue with whiskey.

46
00:01:58,501 --> 00:02:00,090
What does this whiskey we got here?
This is,

47
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:02,040
I don't know if Jamie just kinda like 
throw it out there.

48
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,950
Gave us at the comedy store.
It's called Angel's envy.

49
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:07,680
Oh,
that sounds like a think like angels are

50
00:02:07,681 --> 00:02:10,080
really envious of whiskey though.
I mean,

51
00:02:10,081 --> 00:02:11,730
you're hanging out with God.
You can fly.

52
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:16,800
We want to buy it in a store with angel 
ended enough money.

53
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:19,590
Maybe that sounded balances.
It's got wings on the back.

54
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:22,170
Maybe it's they're trying to market with
red bull.

55
00:02:22,171 --> 00:02:27,171
I don't know.
Those are always the wings on the back 

56
00:02:27,171 --> 00:02:28,750
of a stripper that cries a lot and there
were an angel and envy are both names,

57
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:32,540
strippers that I've that I've never,
never seen that.

58
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:34,350
It's a really good point.
Yeah.

59
00:02:34,351 --> 00:02:36,510
The wings on the back is always a weird 
move.

60
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,550
Right?
But if you're listening,

61
00:02:38,551 --> 00:02:41,680
if you're drinking whiskey with,
with an Alpha brand,

62
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:44,040
you can do whatever you want.
You can put whatever you want,

63
00:02:44,041 --> 00:02:45,480
whatever kind of whiskey you want in 
there.

64
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,830
You're very open minded.
Yeah.

65
00:02:46,831 --> 00:02:49,770
The Alpha brain cancels that out.
It could be,

66
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:53,190
give me the worst whiskey in the world 
and the Alpha brain makes it better.

67
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:58,550
Have you taken this anywhere?
This a right brain have not really 

68
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:00,970
counting on your listeners and deadlies 
fans to do that.

69
00:03:00,971 --> 00:03:05,170
I want it to be organic.
It can spread brown the next time you go

70
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:07,780
to some exotic location and they have a 
right,

71
00:03:07,781 --> 00:03:09,460
like if you're in Nepal.
Oh,

72
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:12,130
I'm going to a northwest.
Territory's will here.

73
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:14,770
Or your boys on your hat there.
The eastmans oh you really like a week.

74
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:15,840
Oh Wow.
I will.

75
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,250
You do it up there.
Caribou and dall sheep.

76
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:23,450
Oh Wow.
So we're doing a film about their Yeti 

77
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:23,450
film.
Yeti presents to them about their family

78
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:28,381
history and the northwest territories.
Like technically what part of Alaska is 

79
00:03:28,381 --> 00:03:28,540
that?
So that's.

80
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:30,190
It's east of Alaska,
right?

81
00:03:30,191 --> 00:03:32,530
East of British Columbia.
It's up towards the Arctic circle.

82
00:03:32,531 --> 00:03:35,530
So we'll fly into norman wells and go 
north from there,

83
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:40,650
up into the Mckenzie mountains,
which are about as far north as you can 

84
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:44,131
get before hit.
The Arctic circle will be sniffing the 

85
00:03:44,131 --> 00:03:45,130
arctic circle and most days.
But it's still still Alaska,

86
00:03:45,131 --> 00:03:45,710
right?
No,

87
00:03:45,711 --> 00:03:46,160
no,
no.

88
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:47,680
Its own territory.
Real.

89
00:03:47,681 --> 00:03:49,030
Yep.
Oh Wow.

90
00:03:49,031 --> 00:03:49,890
Same as Yukon.
I mean,

91
00:03:49,891 --> 00:03:51,340
you know,
you think Yukon Moose or whatever.

92
00:03:51,341 --> 00:03:52,680
They're all their own territories.
That's.

93
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,850
Oh,
so he's Yukon is not Alaska.

94
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:57,670
We'd have to look that up.
I don't want to be right.

95
00:03:57,830 --> 00:03:59,200
I'd have to look at a globe and I'm 
looking.

96
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:01,750
I'm not questioning like I know.
I mean I don't know either,

97
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:03,670
but northwest territories is its own 
territory.

98
00:04:03,671 --> 00:04:05,040
It's not alive.
So who owns that?

99
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:06,880
Canada,
I guess.

100
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:07,640
Really?
Yeah.

101
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:12,930
Oh,
so it's like past Alaska becomes Canada 

102
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:13,030
again.
This is getting real deep.

103
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,100
I should've known Kevin on this package 
here,

104
00:04:15,101 --> 00:04:17,860
like tell me the history of northwest 
territories.

105
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:21,090
So here it is right now on a map.
So you kind of.

106
00:04:21,091 --> 00:04:26,091
Territory is the Yukon is slightly east 
or east rather east and then the 

107
00:04:26,111 --> 00:04:29,710
northwest territories course is further 
east above Alberta.

108
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:35,670
So you're getting up there into,
into the Arctic and it is connected to 

109
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:37,070
Canada.
Yeah.

110
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,120
But it's also connected to Alaska.
It's no,

111
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:46,480
it's to Yukon Party Canada.
It's one of the provinces had it.

112
00:04:46,481 --> 00:04:48,730
Right.
I'm getting confused myself.

113
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:54,090
Yeah.
I thought that the British Columbia 

114
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:54,090
section.

115
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:54,090
So I saw a British Columbia.
I thought that was part of Alaska.

116
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:55,600
You could read the wikipedia.
It's always really.

117
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,100
It's really different.
Dramatic,

118
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:02,610
wild mountainous and sparsely populated.
It's crazy that it's north of northern 

119
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:03,160
Alberta,
like people like,

120
00:05:03,161 --> 00:05:08,161
you know what,
it's just not fucking cold enough here 

121
00:05:08,161 --> 00:05:08,161
in the winter.
We've got to keep going.

122
00:05:08,161 --> 00:05:09,970
Well they have lakes.
They've got.

123
00:05:09,971 --> 00:05:12,080
I mean they have lakes for like a month.
I don't know.

124
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,980
I think when we're up there,
we were talking about last week.

125
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:16,420
I think when we're up there there'll be 
no,

126
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:19,240
it'll be daylight 24 hours a day.
Oh Wow.

127
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:24,390
I believe now when you do that,
do you bring like one of those eyeball 

128
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:24,390
cover things?
Uh,

129
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:25,360
yeah.
We'll have to.

130
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:27,040
Yeah,
the mask,

131
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,200
I have all covered things.
Whatever you have to.

132
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:30,610
You have to.
Unless you really,

133
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,770
unless you can get into 10 just Kinda 
zonked out.

134
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:33,730
But it's,
it's 12,

135
00:05:33,731 --> 00:05:38,731
I think it's 12 or 13 days up there.
So by the time you get to day five or 

136
00:05:38,731 --> 00:05:42,121
six years,
I mean you're living out of your 

137
00:05:42,121 --> 00:05:42,121
backpack.
You're carrying probably 50,

138
00:05:42,121 --> 00:05:45,691
60,
70 pounds in your pack and climbing 

139
00:05:45,691 --> 00:05:45,691
every day.
So I mean it's probably the time you get

140
00:05:45,691 --> 00:05:46,750
laid down.
I don't think it matters.

141
00:05:46,751 --> 00:05:51,751
Well,
what's going on now when you do 

142
00:05:51,751 --> 00:05:51,751
something like that?
Um,

143
00:05:51,751 --> 00:05:53,230
how much gear you guys bring you living 
entirely out of your backpack.

144
00:05:53,231 --> 00:05:56,590
So when the float plane is what in the,
in the plane takes you to base camp,

145
00:05:56,591 --> 00:05:59,830
which I think in this case is there's 
not a float plane.

146
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:00,510
Well,
so we'll be,

147
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:05,540
it'll be a wheel plane.
We'll we can take 50 pounds and then 

148
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:05,900
sounds each 50 pounds plus your body 
weight,

149
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:10,960
plus you evaluate and then six days in 
they will either come in a helicopter 

150
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,981
and pick us up and move us if we're not 
having any luck or they'll just drop us 

151
00:06:14,981 --> 00:06:14,981
more gear.

152
00:06:14,981 --> 00:06:19,120
So you can.
So the plan would be take 50 pounds of 

153
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,560
essential gear and then have other gear 
as backup back at base camp.

154
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:23,840
Oh Wow.
So you fly into base camp.

155
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:26,870
It's like for me it will be like Austin 
to Denver,

156
00:06:26,871 --> 00:06:29,270
Denver to Edmonton,
Edmonton to Norman Wells,

157
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:34,850
hoppa charter to base camp.
And then from there fly out into the 

158
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:37,010
hunting areas.
How many days travel is that?

159
00:06:37,011 --> 00:06:40,160
It was like two days and change two days
solid of just flying.

160
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:42,850
Just flying was your overnighting 
because they.

161
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,810
I mean they run like one added Norman 
Wells.

162
00:06:44,811 --> 00:06:46,340
They run like one flight a day or 
something.

163
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:51,430
One or two flights a day.
You have to be really dedicated to this 

164
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:52,490
kind of experience to travel.
Just travel for two days.

165
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,540
I once you do it,
man,

166
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:55,670
that's like the only way to go though.
Really?

167
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,770
It's once you.
It's not the only way to go.

168
00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:00,080
That's Douchey to say,
but it's like the best.

169
00:07:00,081 --> 00:07:01,820
Most when you get back you're like,
man,

170
00:07:01,821 --> 00:07:04,850
that sucked,
but I wouldn't want to change it.

171
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:08,930
You something happens to people when 
they do those like exotic location,

172
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:12,650
like when they go sheep hunting and they
risked their lives.

173
00:07:12,651 --> 00:07:17,651
Like I've seen some video of guys like,
well I saw some video of you guys when 

174
00:07:17,651 --> 00:07:17,740
you were in New Zealand.
Yeah.

175
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:21,290
When you were risking your lives with 
every step.

176
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:23,330
Yeah.
It's the whole time too.

177
00:07:23,331 --> 00:07:24,260
It's not just like,
oh,

178
00:07:24,261 --> 00:07:25,970
we got up to this one area where the 
sheep live.

179
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,440
You're just where we were in,
in,

180
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:32,660
in New Zealand with green tree.
We when you get up into,

181
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:35,600
so there's like beachwood far,
so you're looking at like a 3000,

182
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:37,460
30 540,000
foot mountain,

183
00:07:37,461 --> 00:07:37,970
right?
You're,

184
00:07:37,971 --> 00:07:42,050
we stayed in a little hut in the river 
valley and so when you're down there,

185
00:07:42,051 --> 00:07:42,860
you're looking up,
you're like,

186
00:07:42,861 --> 00:07:43,940
oh,
that's where the tar live.

187
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:44,780
Huh?
Oh,

188
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:47,150
43,000
feet from where we are right now.

189
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:51,010
For people that don't know is a crazy 
looking animal Himalayan.

190
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:56,470
Yeah.
It looks like a lord of the rings or 

191
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:56,470
something.
It really does.

192
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:56,470
Yeah.
It looks like a wooly mammoth,

193
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:58,650
but just a miniature version.
Yeah,

194
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,400
really crazy.
We'll leave furry,

195
00:08:01,401 --> 00:08:05,000
shaggy a goat essentially like a goat 
slash sheet.

196
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:07,970
But I mean the funny part about all that
is,

197
00:08:07,971 --> 00:08:12,971
is when you heard those right there,
look at the image they look like where 

198
00:08:12,971 --> 00:08:17,540
we,
where you would look across these 

199
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:18,971
little,
these Alpine valleys and you'd see him 

200
00:08:18,971 --> 00:08:19,970
look like a black bear looks like a 
giant black bear.

201
00:08:19,971 --> 00:08:22,700
And he just thinking,
where am I and what is that thing?

202
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:28,020
God.
So I'm not like you have some really 

203
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:28,790
cool adventure or on this podcast.
That's not me.

204
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:32,050
When I see that thing,
I think what the fuck am?

205
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,570
Where am I like it?
It's wild looking.

206
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,470
Yeah.
And they live up in the Alpine.

207
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:38,930
So there you've got the beech wood 
forest,

208
00:08:38,931 --> 00:08:43,931
which is probably,
if I would just say hiking straight up 

209
00:08:43,931 --> 00:08:43,931
for about an hour and a half or two 
hours.

210
00:08:43,931 --> 00:08:46,070
And is that an innovation species for 
New Zealand?

211
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:47,840
They're feral,
not feral.

212
00:08:47,841 --> 00:08:48,440
That's.
I don't know.

213
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:50,840
They're non native.
So all the mammals on the island,

214
00:08:50,841 --> 00:08:54,050
they're non native.
All of them were all were introduced by.

215
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:56,440
And I wish I had really looked up 
someone specific,

216
00:08:56,441 --> 00:08:58,110
but they are all introduced by other 
countries.

217
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:03,111
Europe sent animals over there,
Teddy Roosevelt sent some animals over 

218
00:09:03,111 --> 00:09:03,111
there like,
hey,

219
00:09:03,111 --> 00:09:06,271
I hear you're going to want these.
And so the problem over there to get on 

220
00:09:06,691 --> 00:09:10,590
a whole different subject is that the 
people on that island,

221
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:13,500
the residence of,
of New Zealand don't value those animals

222
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:16,530
as part of the landscape.
They're just there.

223
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:22,150
I mean,
Farrell would be a good term sheet of 

224
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:22,150
the way they view them to the value they
have on them.

225
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:23,070
We have like moose mule deer.
That's,

226
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,770
that's part of our ethos as a country.
Right.

227
00:09:25,771 --> 00:09:28,680
And our ecosystems and our ecosystem,
they've been here before.

228
00:09:28,681 --> 00:09:31,940
We were some level and so over there 
they just,

229
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:36,950
they'll jump in the helicopter and mowed
down like 40 red stag on a weekend 

230
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:38,610
because they want to control the 
population one because there's no winter

231
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:40,320
kill and their predation,
all that stuff.

232
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:44,880
But they also just don't see a big red 
stag the way we see a big elk.

233
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:49,910
They just don't,
they don't have the value for it down 

234
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:49,910
there.
Well,

235
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:52,800
it's also the weird thing about having 
no predators is how do you handle that?

236
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:55,200
Do you bring in predators?
Like if they don't,

237
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:59,300
they risk disease and there's all sorts 
of weird things that can happen like,

238
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,510
like they have on Lanai.

239
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:01,410
Yes.
Yeah.

240
00:10:01,411 --> 00:10:02,340
And so that's it.
Right.

241
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:07,530
And we've had,
we've done that in this country with 

242
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:09,981
bringing down a northwest.
What's the timber wolf that we brought 

243
00:10:09,981 --> 00:10:12,941
him down and put them in the states and 
that's while that may seem like a good 

244
00:10:12,941 --> 00:10:16,701
solution and we,
when we were in British Columbia Hunt 

245
00:10:16,701 --> 00:10:17,760
Moose together,
we saw some calf skeletons.

246
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,980
Yeah.
We showed that picture on the podcast.

247
00:10:19,981 --> 00:10:23,250
It was kind of fucked up.
That thing has just been decimated.

248
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:27,420
Those wolves and I saw in Montana one 
time I saw them running circles.

249
00:10:27,421 --> 00:10:32,421
They run in like concentric circles.
I just run like a bullseye pattern when 

250
00:10:32,421 --> 00:10:35,361
they're hunting.
I feel like the packs and I just 

251
00:10:35,361 --> 00:10:35,790
watched.
We were.

252
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:41,130
I killed my elk on the first day of this
hunt and I was watching and you would 

253
00:10:41,281 --> 00:10:46,281
show there be a different wolf kill like
every other day in this valley and it's 

254
00:10:46,281 --> 00:10:50,781
like the wolves were just running in 
circles and I did see a couple of bulls 

255
00:10:50,781 --> 00:10:50,781
fighting that in that trip.

256
00:10:50,781 --> 00:10:51,860
Trying to call him in.
Yeah,

257
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:53,470
some of them.
Yeah,

258
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,990
two of them.
Wow.

259
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:57,540
That was like 1200 yards away and I had 
a rifle and I was thinking.

260
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:00,150
I was thinking about it,
but I mean once you see,

261
00:11:00,151 --> 00:11:04,210
when you see a dead fon everyday you go 
hunting and pre a new,

262
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:09,780
maybe not new to that day,
but knew that week you started to think 

263
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:12,330
like how if this pack work this valley 
for a full year,

264
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:15,090
what could they do?
And there's numbers to that.

265
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:16,820
Somewhere at some people have figured 
out what,

266
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:19,870
how many elk?
A year upon the eldest son,

267
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:22,200
Kale,
before the wolves were reintroduced,

268
00:11:22,201 --> 00:11:24,590
there was an issue with overpopulation,
so it.

269
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,400
So that's where I think that's probably 
100 come in,

270
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:27,450
you know,
you could,

271
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:29,460
I,
I value that animal.

272
00:11:29,461 --> 00:11:34,461
I'm willing to pay you for the 
opportunity to help you conserve that 

273
00:11:34,461 --> 00:11:34,630
population.
And so that's,

274
00:11:34,631 --> 00:11:36,580
that becomes very problematic for 
people.

275
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:38,040
Like when you start talking about 
wolves,

276
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:43,980
dogs does wilderness or another one of 
those ones that black bears too.

277
00:11:43,981 --> 00:11:44,790
I mean,
I think it's,

278
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:49,290
you don't eat them.
I mean even more than any tools way more

279
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:54,291
than any that was talking to.
There was a gal in my work that I was 

280
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:55,240
talking to and she lives in Austin,
Texas and is very,

281
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:58,210
not a hunter,
but works at Yeti,

282
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:02,200
and so she's around hunting and we were 
talking about wolves and I just said,

283
00:12:02,201 --> 00:12:07,201
look,
I don't have a really hard and opinion 

284
00:12:07,201 --> 00:12:07,201
on bulls.
I've not spent enough time around them.

285
00:12:07,201 --> 00:12:09,370
I just know that their meat processors 
on four legs,

286
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:12,530
they give no shits about anything.
They don't.

287
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:17,580
They're not just eating,
they don't just eat what feels their 

288
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:18,070
belly.
They eat and then they eat more and they

289
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:19,990
kill more,
and that's all they're wired to do.

290
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,490
Right.
I've seen that in action,

291
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:26,491
so that's all I really know.
I don't know whether that's good for an 

292
00:12:26,491 --> 00:12:26,491
ecosystem bad,
whatever,

293
00:12:26,491 --> 00:12:27,370
and she just said,
well,

294
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:32,371
I didn't really know that it's hunting 
has really bad wolves will seem to have 

295
00:12:32,371 --> 00:12:34,690
a good pr agent and hunting and 
management have a terrible pr agent,

296
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:36,400
you know,
so I think that,

297
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,230
you know,
that's,

298
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:42,320
that's part of the problem,
that there's a sect of people that are 

299
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:42,320
really glorifying a wolf for good 
reason.

300
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:47,070
I mean,
it's awesome animal that majestic 

301
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:48,631
animal,
but at the same time there is a 

302
00:12:48,631 --> 00:12:48,631
juxtaposition of that that needs to be 
told to.

303
00:12:48,631 --> 00:12:53,380
Well,
I think a big part of the issue is that 

304
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:55,290
people know that they virtually wiped 
them out in North America at one point 

305
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:59,431
in time.
And I think people feel guilty about 

306
00:12:59,431 --> 00:12:59,431
that.
Yeah.

307
00:12:59,431 --> 00:12:59,431
Well,
and then they should feel guilty.

308
00:12:59,431 --> 00:13:01,390
They should feel ashamed about the 
Mallard duck elk.

309
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,490
People don't know the detail.
Yeah.

310
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:08,491
But we brought those back to the point 
where the numbers are higher than 

311
00:13:08,491 --> 00:13:11,221
they've ever been before.
But those same people don't know how 

312
00:13:11,221 --> 00:13:11,221
that happened though.
Right?

313
00:13:11,221 --> 00:13:13,000
Those same people aren't aware of how 
they just see white tails around.

314
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:13,420
They're like,
oh,

315
00:13:13,421 --> 00:13:15,220
that's annoying.
People with the car.

316
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:16,570
They don't know that it turn of the 
century.

317
00:13:16,571 --> 00:13:18,010
They were almost all gone.
Yeah.

318
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,870
Because we market hunting them to hell.
Uh,

319
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,290
and so I think that's,
there's just,

320
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,580
it's just education,
man.

321
00:13:24,581 --> 00:13:27,040
I just think people need to seek the 
other side,

322
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:30,220
which I always try to do and you do all 
the time,

323
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:33,220
just seek whatever the other side is.
And the hunting is not always the way to

324
00:13:33,221 --> 00:13:38,221
go yet,
but it's inconvenient because like it's 

325
00:13:38,221 --> 00:13:38,221
hard,
like if,

326
00:13:38,221 --> 00:13:42,070
say if you're a vegetarian or a Vegan,
you're going to get your information 

327
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:45,361
from animal rights activists and it's 
going to be biased in that direction.

328
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:50,550
Or if you're a hunter,
you're going to get your information 

329
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:52,030
from hunting and conservation groups and
it might be biased in the other way.

330
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,550
And I think wolves are a good thing 
because they're awesome.

331
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:55,690
You know,
I don't know.

332
00:13:55,830 --> 00:14:00,830
I don't not like walls I think know 
hunter's like wipe the wolves that I've 

333
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:05,041
never heard that I've just started like 
what's the carrying capacity for this 

334
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:05,041
state but this region for wolves.
Right?

335
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:06,680
How many can there be?
And,

336
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:08,510
and I know in a lot of cases,
you know,

337
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:11,000
the biologists would say one thing like,
okay,

338
00:14:11,001 --> 00:14:16,001
here's 100 bulbs in this area.
And then when it ballooned up to a 

339
00:14:16,001 --> 00:14:17,260
thousand,
they argued for hunters come in and help

340
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,810
put that population down.
There were still a pushback,

341
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,800
like,
wait a minute,

342
00:14:20,801 --> 00:14:24,730
we said we agreed upon scientifically,
biologically,

343
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:25,690
you know,
we,

344
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:28,150
we know the problem is that it's 
negotiable at all.

345
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,450
It should have been like once the wolves
hit 2000 starting,

346
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:36,510
then you start a hunting season,
but then the real issue is it's 

347
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:38,350
incredibly hard to shoot a wolf like 
this.

348
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:41,320
It's not as simple as you ought and find
a wolf and kill them.

349
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:44,230
They're really smart and they think 
about Tara and New Zealand.

350
00:14:44,231 --> 00:14:46,630
You can't just like if they're over 
populated in there,

351
00:14:46,631 --> 00:14:47,460
you can't just like,
oh,

352
00:14:47,461 --> 00:14:49,120
we'll just walk up the hill and crack a 
couple.

353
00:14:49,121 --> 00:14:51,010
I mean that's,
that's a pretty big feat.

354
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:56,020
So they jumped in a helicopter and 
that's gone down the tar that way to 

355
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:56,990
really,
God damn.

356
00:14:56,991 --> 00:14:59,510
So how do they determine whether or not 
they should be getting them down?

357
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:04,890
It's a no,
and I don't know like the holistic 

358
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:07,361
method that I use,
but I know our guide up there this year 

359
00:15:07,361 --> 00:15:07,361
was just talking about he would go to 
the,

360
00:15:07,361 --> 00:15:10,040
to the sheep stations or the ranch 
owners or are some of the areas.

361
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:15,220
Some of those big mountain are own 
privately and some of the areas where 

362
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:19,901
they were down a little bit lower than 
they would just say go out today and 

363
00:15:19,901 --> 00:15:20,600
kill a hundred and that's what they 
would do and it was,

364
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:25,720
it was not,
it didn't seem to me to be too 

365
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:25,720
scientific in the way they went about 
it,

366
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:28,430
but it's a private land owner telling 
you,

367
00:15:28,431 --> 00:15:30,920
hey these,
this is an infestation essentially,

368
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:34,790
and my argument to them was like,
why don't you just,

369
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:36,830
these animals are here,
they're not going anywhere,

370
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:38,390
they're not going to swim over to 
Australia.

371
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:41,030
Why don't you just treat them like we 
treat our,

372
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:43,520
our wildlife whilst you just accept 
them.

373
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:48,850
And then there was some people down 
there that were agreed with me whole 

374
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:51,581
heartedly.
Some people in the guide and outfitting 

375
00:15:51,581 --> 00:15:53,320
community just like,
why don't you just accept these animals 

376
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,170
as part of your landscape and treat them
like that.

377
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:57,440
And I think that's,
that's a swelling opinion down there for

378
00:15:57,441 --> 00:15:58,070
sure.
Well,

379
00:15:58,071 --> 00:16:03,071
how do they accept.
I mean they just treat them like their 

380
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:03,740
pasts.
I wouldn't say pass because they do have

381
00:16:03,741 --> 00:16:08,741
some value because hunters from around 
the world would go down there like we 

382
00:16:08,741 --> 00:16:08,741
did,
but don't have a lot of,

383
00:16:08,741 --> 00:16:13,171
um,
a lot of that is on public lands or 

384
00:16:13,171 --> 00:16:13,171
excuse me,
private land in those high fence places.

385
00:16:13,171 --> 00:16:14,660
And that's,
that's basically stag.

386
00:16:14,661 --> 00:16:15,860
You can't really.
It's going to be,

387
00:16:15,861 --> 00:16:18,900
it's hard to high fence for shaming tar.
They just live in places very.

388
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:21,800
He'd been down to put up if he tried,
you'd be dumb.

389
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:24,470
But stag stag is a whole different deal 
down there.

390
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,090
Yeah.
I mean it's because they're so big,

391
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:31,440
like they,
the people want to go there and get a 

392
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:31,440
big day rack of antlers to their 
discredit,

393
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:36,050
like they have harvested the bad parts 
of our hunting culture and marketed it 

394
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:36,050
brilliantly.

395
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:36,280
They have.
Um,

396
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,840
and I think there's a lot of people down
there that would push back on that,

397
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,370
um,
on that idea.

398
00:16:40,371 --> 00:16:41,270
But yeah,
explain that,

399
00:16:41,271 --> 00:16:46,271
what that means by the bad parts and not
just the American hunting culture 

400
00:16:46,271 --> 00:16:46,550
because there's a lot of Europeans that 
go there too.

401
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:49,550
I think the parts of the trophy hunting,
the hey come down here and,

402
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:51,800
and,
and work on this five inch tag.

403
00:16:51,801 --> 00:16:55,590
We've got it here and they have agents 
that go around and sell it for $500.

404
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:58,280
We're talking about folks is the size of
the antlers,

405
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:03,310
not the size of the actual animal itself
that people get super obsessed and they 

406
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:07,691
fetish numbers like you know the score 
and what a score is for people don't 

407
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:13,541
know.
They take a tape measure and they go 

408
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:15,791
over very specific sections of the 
antlers and they calculate all the 

409
00:17:15,791 --> 00:17:19,901
measurements together and when they do 
that they come up with some number and 

410
00:17:19,901 --> 00:17:23,840
there's these milestone benchmark 
numbers like a 200 inch white tails,

411
00:17:23,841 --> 00:17:28,690
a huge deer or a 400 inch elk is a huge 
elk.

412
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:32,020
It is.
They get stags and go to 500 and more,

413
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:37,540
more and more insane.
And is it as big as an elk looking 

414
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:40,010
animal body size?
Not quite close but not quite.

415
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:43,940
And and I and one of the sheep stations 
we hunted with originally,

416
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:47,200
they farm.
They essentially form red deer,

417
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:51,660
red deer and stag.
Same thing are walking around in,

418
00:17:51,661 --> 00:17:54,360
these are the same animal.
No down there.

419
00:17:54,361 --> 00:17:55,540
Red Stag,
red years.

420
00:17:56,040 --> 00:18:01,040
Basically the same thing,
but you find red deer in Europe and 

421
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:01,040
they're different.
Oh genius.

422
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:04,110
Why do they call them a stack but isn't 
a stagnant of male stag,

423
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:07,520
stag and,
and high and being the female h I n D,

424
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:08,550
yeah.
And so,

425
00:18:08,551 --> 00:18:12,540
but you would call it a,
you would call the animals are red deer.

426
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:16,830
I've heard it called low 500 in Europe 
and they call it a red deer there.

427
00:18:16,831 --> 00:18:19,860
So I'm not sure those deer came from 
there anyway.

428
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:24,860
So I'm sure it's the same.
So they came and they dropped them off 

429
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:27,980
in the 18 hundreds just to turn the 
whole place into a giant like hunting 

430
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:28,110
provision.
Right.

431
00:18:28,111 --> 00:18:30,960
Some level at some level.
I'd love to read the history of that.

432
00:18:30,961 --> 00:18:33,090
I don't really haven't gone that far 
back,

433
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,000
but he said that before they came there 
was no mammals there.

434
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:38,390
Yeah.
Like what a weird patch of land.

435
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:43,400
It's a weird like New Zealand is,
is definitely coming from where we come 

436
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,780
from and all the things we have and we 
just find it normal that we can hunt how

437
00:18:45,781 --> 00:18:50,781
many,
how many huntable species are there on 

438
00:18:50,781 --> 00:18:50,781
this?
Um,

439
00:18:50,781 --> 00:18:52,320
you know,
on this continent going down there,

440
00:18:52,321 --> 00:18:57,321
it's just such a weird.
But in the end they celebrate the 

441
00:18:57,321 --> 00:19:00,561
outdoor culture.
They celebrate hunting and fishing in 

442
00:19:00,561 --> 00:19:02,721
the way that almost in the way that we 
do and they have public land much like 

443
00:19:02,721 --> 00:19:06,591
we do and they're publicly and his is 
more revered and more well managed and 

444
00:19:06,591 --> 00:19:07,170
better taken care of.

445
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:12,170
I think that our public lands and it's 
more usable and so they have all these 

446
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:14,340
like similar properties that we have in 
America,

447
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:18,060
but at some level they're just,
I think they just got poor luck.

448
00:19:18,061 --> 00:19:22,680
They don't have native mammals too.
They don't have the Bald Eagle to put on

449
00:19:22,681 --> 00:19:23,970
their master.
They,

450
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:25,360
they just have these,
you know,

451
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:30,620
essentially shammy tar and tar aren't,
they're not native either.

452
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:31,500
No.
None of those.

453
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:33,690
None of them native.
None of them.

454
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:36,270
They also have Canadian geese that are 
not native.

455
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:41,390
Right.
Did you notice you used to have the 

456
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:41,390
biggest ego in the world?
Really?

457
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:41,390
Yeah.
These,

458
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:46,251
to have an eagle called the Haast Eagle 
and apparently they killed them off in 

459
00:19:46,251 --> 00:19:48,180
the 14 hundreds and they were so big.
There's speculation.

460
00:19:48,181 --> 00:19:50,370
They used to eat people.
I'd kill them all.

461
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:53,580
Foot 14 foot wingspan I think is what we
figured out.

462
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:55,570
I'm not exaggerating if you've ever been
over there.

463
00:19:55,571 --> 00:20:00,571
It's.
It really is like if it's a place where 

464
00:20:00,571 --> 00:20:00,571
that kind of eagle would live,
that's what it looked like.

465
00:20:00,571 --> 00:20:02,940
Leash.
That's what a hostile looks like.

466
00:20:02,941 --> 00:20:07,941
We're looking at an eagle that's 
literally the size of a big person and 

467
00:20:08,031 --> 00:20:13,031
that's up the look at the size of that 
fucking thing and so this can be.

468
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:15,780
That's Gandalf.
I mean look,

469
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:17,790
if it's as big as a person like that 
picture,

470
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:20,600
go to that first picture again,
like,

471
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,190
yeah,
look how big that thing is.

472
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:24,990
I mean,
if that thing spreads its wings,

473
00:20:24,991 --> 00:20:27,390
if you had been over there,
the landscape over there and some of the

474
00:20:27,391 --> 00:20:29,940
Alpine areas that it looks like a place 
where that would live,

475
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:31,650
that will kill you.
That thing,

476
00:20:31,651 --> 00:20:35,520
if they caught you hiking,
it would just pull you off the cliff and

477
00:20:35,521 --> 00:20:36,840
just drop you off.
Oh,

478
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:41,040
that's not a real hot steagall.
The actual hostile with Google images.

479
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,900
We're getting all kinds.
We got Gandalf riding an eagle.

480
00:20:42,901 --> 00:20:44,280
We got.
But that one,

481
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:48,010
that one with the emus or whatever the 
fuck

482
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:51,070
those animals are.
Is that a box that he's carried?

483
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:52,040
That one's here.
Oh yeah.

484
00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:54,850
So when did it go extinct,
Jamie?

485
00:20:54,851 --> 00:20:59,851
What does it say?
Look at the size of the dude standing 

486
00:20:59,851 --> 00:21:00,610
next to what?
The skeleton of a hostile.

487
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:02,510
And he was that dude.
That dude is awesome.

488
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:03,460
I'm looking at him.
Yeah,

489
00:21:03,461 --> 00:21:05,830
he looks like a wizard.
Who's robes?

490
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:11,100
That's an ancient intellectual and it 
really opened the door for 1,680.

491
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:17,250
I don't know what it says.
The real thing actually lived on earth 

492
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:20,380
and of course it was known as the tiger 
and the tiger skin.

493
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:23,380
That's not that long ago.
1,600.

494
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:28,440
Holy Shit.
I thought it was 14 hundreds because 

495
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,130
there are six feet tall.
Oh wait.

496
00:21:30,131 --> 00:21:33,220
Only 35 pounds and it had a wingspan of 
10 feet.

497
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:34,450
Wow,
that's crazy.

498
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:35,470
[inaudible],
they're hollow bones.

499
00:21:35,471 --> 00:21:40,471
I guess.
Thirty five pounds doesn't seem that 

500
00:21:40,471 --> 00:21:40,471
much,
man.

501
00:21:40,471 --> 00:21:40,930
How do you go back to that picture?
How the fuck is that thing?

502
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,420
Thirty five pounds.
There's nothing.

503
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:48,450
Six feet tall.
10 foot wingspan that things only 35 

504
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:48,730
pounds.
That seems wrong.

505
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:54,920
Turkeys heavy.
Like you pick up a Turkey and like 25 

506
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:55,870
pound range.
Look at the size of the thing.

507
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,980
He's all big.
Every time I'm hanging around you.

508
00:21:59,981 --> 00:22:04,981
I hear.
I hear about these evil mystical 

509
00:22:04,981 --> 00:22:04,981
animals.
Well,

510
00:22:04,981 --> 00:22:06,910
I think giant bear concern was that the 
Haast Eagle,

511
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:12,210
they might have killed it off like the 
local New Zealand folks might've killed 

512
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:13,000
it off back then because they were 
eating people.

513
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:15,520
I do not blame them and see if that's 
the truth.

514
00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:20,850
That might be a lie.
Did didn't know about this hostile you 

515
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:21,700
like doing,
you know I weighed 100 at a place called

516
00:22:21,701 --> 00:22:23,860
hostile when you're were over there.
So maybe connection.

517
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:27,380
Maybe we were really find and maybe find
some ancient eagle skull.

518
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:33,080
They go hook ball to see if at eight 
people relationship with human google 

519
00:22:33,611 --> 00:22:38,611
that.
See where it says relationship with 

520
00:22:38,611 --> 00:22:38,611
humans.
Yeah,

521
00:22:38,611 --> 00:22:38,611
do do,
do,

522
00:22:38,611 --> 00:22:38,690
do,
do,

523
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:43,700
could have been possible to do even 
smaller Golden Eagles are capable of 

524
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:44,500
killing.
Yeah.

525
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:47,200
They said they kill humans,
which scientists believe could have been

526
00:22:47,201 --> 00:22:49,690
possible.
If the name relates to the Eagle,

527
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:52,270
given the massive size of the strength 
of the bird.

528
00:22:52,271 --> 00:22:54,960
Even smaller Golden Eagles are capable 
of killing praise.

529
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:58,000
[inaudible] biggest Sitka deer or bear 
cub?

530
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:03,840
Yeah.
That fucking thing killed a few people 

531
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:03,840
for sure.
Like a baby.

532
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:03,840
You didn't think.
Yeah,

533
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:04,630
like a baby.

534
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:12,060
You don't think that a Predator like 
that did not learn what it could and 

535
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:13,930
could not go get that.
So the sculptures,

536
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:17,110
goofy sculpture,
the sculpture,

537
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:18,640
is that the sculpture we were looking 
at?

538
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:19,260
Maybe?
Yeah,

539
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:24,270
it was approximation of it.
It says it's seven point five meters 25 

540
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:24,270
feet tall.
No,

541
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:28,570
that wasn't 25 feet tall with a wingspan
of 11 point five meters.

542
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:29,950
Thirty eight feet.
Oh,

543
00:23:29,951 --> 00:23:31,890
okay.
That's that.

544
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:34,050
That's the art park that we're looking 
at news.

545
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:38,050
That's just a giant sculpture of animal.
Okay,

546
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:39,400
I get ya.
But uh,

547
00:23:39,401 --> 00:23:44,401
there's a really cool eagle that lives 
in the rainforest called the heartbeat 

548
00:23:44,401 --> 00:23:44,401
eagle.
That eats monkeys.

549
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:45,710
Want

550
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:47,860
to know about this stuff?
Man?

551
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,700
I find myself in a room in a rain forest
a couple months.

552
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:53,930
Be Looking for Harpy Eagles all over 
time.

553
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:58,990
Well,
there was a dude that was trying to put 

554
00:23:58,990 --> 00:23:58,990
a camera in a heartbeat.
Eagle Nest,

555
00:23:58,990 --> 00:24:00,200
and he got attacked by a heartbeat.
Eagle.

556
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:05,150
So it shouldn't have been doing that.
Scientists should have worked in a movie

557
00:24:05,151 --> 00:24:10,151
theater or something.
It was his thing,

558
00:24:10,521 --> 00:24:13,310
man.
See if you can stop looking at these.

559
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:14,380
Terrible.
The way.

560
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:16,910
Cool looking because it's kind of white.
Look,

561
00:24:16,911 --> 00:24:18,590
we and we were talking about this when 
we were in Lanai.

562
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:23,650
I have a problem swimming in the ocean 
because I'm feeling like I look like a 

563
00:24:23,650 --> 00:24:24,950
seal all the time when I'm in there and 
I feel like sharks will.

564
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,180
They're like,
look at that.

565
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:31,250
Like I just got this bolt.
His legs bitten off yesterday in 

566
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:31,250
Florida.

567
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:31,250
See?
Yeah.

568
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:33,880
This is awareness man.
CHOMP chomp shrunk.

569
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:36,290
So now I'm scared of this guys,
thanks to this.

570
00:24:36,291 --> 00:24:41,291
You know that the bull shark swim so far
up river that they live in fresh water 

571
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:45,560
and they have been found as high as 
Illinois God,

572
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:49,520
as they go up to fucking Illinois and 
they're the most aggressive sharks.

573
00:24:49,610 --> 00:24:51,050
I heard that.
I've heard that before.

574
00:24:51,051 --> 00:24:52,580
At least to live right on the Illinois 
River.

575
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:57,670
Will they also are the reason why the 
movie jaws wasn't inspired by a great 

576
00:24:57,670 --> 00:25:01,871
white shark.
It was inspired by a series of attacks 

577
00:25:01,871 --> 00:25:02,960
by bull sharks and freshwater rivers in 
New Jersey.

578
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:08,550
We talk about something else now.
It's freaking me out and they made the 

579
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:09,200
music like,
oh,

580
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:11,440
it's terrible.
Yeah.

581
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:12,710
Johnson,
your psyche,

582
00:25:12,711 --> 00:25:15,110
that stuff changed.
What would the music be for one of those

583
00:25:15,111 --> 00:25:16,370
big eagles?
Same.

584
00:25:16,610 --> 00:25:19,020
It would be death metal.
Yeah.

585
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:24,170
He'd be out in the field,
do death metal music.

586
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:27,800
I've seen too much over in Nepal.
They have these big things called longer

587
00:25:27,801 --> 00:25:30,580
guys.
It's like if it's a Nepali Griffin,

588
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:33,200
it looks like a big old vulture.
You look at that thing up,

589
00:25:33,201 --> 00:25:34,940
see what the wingspan on those,
but they'd be.

590
00:25:34,941 --> 00:25:39,941
We'd be up on some mountain glass if 
your sheep and there'd be like a giant 

591
00:25:39,941 --> 00:25:40,460
thing with the airplane,
eight,

592
00:25:40,461 --> 00:25:45,461
nine foot wingspan and you could see the
creepiest part to me was you could see 

593
00:25:45,461 --> 00:25:48,200
their heads move back and forth,
like,

594
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,120
look,
they were,

595
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:52,220
they were looking for shit and they,
they take,

596
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:56,030
they take and kill a baby sheep.
I saw a video,

597
00:25:56,130 --> 00:25:58,670
but after I got back and I was going to 
freaking out about these things.

598
00:25:58,700 --> 00:25:59,570
I mean,
it's a vulture.

599
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:01,430
Yeah,
it's like a Nepali.

600
00:26:01,431 --> 00:26:02,750
They call it a longer guyer.

601
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:08,080
And when we were there,
they told us all you're gonna see 

602
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:08,660
Griffin's so it,
it had a variety of names,

603
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:11,220
like everything there seems to have.
Um,

604
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:12,160
but it's,
uh,

605
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:13,970
it looks like a vulture.
It's like a giant.

606
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:16,310
I didn't know that they hunted.
That's interesting.

607
00:26:16,311 --> 00:26:17,750
I thought they just say,
well,

608
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:22,760
I watched something on like a planet 
Earth about them and that they showed 

609
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:25,760
them in packs and they were,
they eat bone marrow.

610
00:26:25,761 --> 00:26:27,560
So they would,
they would get a bone off the ground,

611
00:26:27,561 --> 00:26:30,330
fly up into the air and strategically 
drop it onto the ground.

612
00:26:30,331 --> 00:26:31,970
So it would crack open,
fly down,

613
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,530
eat the,
eat the insides.

614
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:34,440
Wow.
Yeah.

615
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:37,490
I haven't figured that out at the same 
thing.

616
00:26:37,491 --> 00:26:42,491
You could just see their brains churn 
and like a lot of times you see it an 

617
00:26:42,491 --> 00:26:43,360
animal in the sky burdened sky.
You sick.

618
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:44,220
It's soaring around.

619
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:48,480
But you could see the predatory brain of
this laundry guy as it flew above us,

620
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:53,510
just churn.
And as I looked around for what to get 

621
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:54,300
after.
Well they say ravens are stupid.

622
00:26:54,301 --> 00:26:55,860
Smart.
Like a smart as chimps.

623
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,500
Yeah.
So you think about this bird,

624
00:26:57,690 --> 00:26:59,700
the bird's brain,
the size of what?

625
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:00,450
I don't know.
Limit,

626
00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:02,310
but yeah,
it's.

627
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,150
It literally found out I want to get 
inside that bone.

628
00:27:06,151 --> 00:27:09,370
I'm going to fly up and drop it.
Some vision net insights.

629
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:14,450
Well,
somewhere along the line they figured a 

630
00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:14,450
long time ago how to drop things off 
cliffs.

631
00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:18,350
Absolutely.
They've been doing that with goats and 

632
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:18,350
stuff.
There's a ton of videos of them grabbing

633
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:20,020
goats and pulling them out like eels 
curricular.

634
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:21,810
Whoa.
That's the longer guy.

635
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,930
What is that thing?
That thing looks fucking evil,

636
00:27:24,931 --> 00:27:27,550
man.
Holy Shit.

637
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:30,540
Look at that face on that thing.

638
00:27:30,570 --> 00:27:33,630
I think when I was over there when we 
were in in the mountains,

639
00:27:33,631 --> 00:27:36,150
I just wrote like a whole page about 
this longer yard.

640
00:27:36,151 --> 00:27:38,510
We saw.
I don't remember it being taller.

641
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,550
That's amazing.
It's like one of the zoo.

642
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:43,980
Oh my God.
They were jet black.

643
00:27:43,981 --> 00:27:45,720
The ones we saw.
Imagine how scary that looks,

644
00:27:45,721 --> 00:27:48,930
but just being jet black.
Wow.

645
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:50,880
The coloration.
What does that.

646
00:27:50,881 --> 00:27:53,910
A bone above mouth and swallowing whole.
Yep.

647
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:56,070
Oh,
primitive creature.

648
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:00,720
Just like complete emotionless eyes.
Yeah.

649
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:01,740
That's.
I,

650
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:06,750
I vividly remember looking up at some 
point and seeing these things floating 

651
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:11,460
in the breeze and looking around and 
thinking that thing is savage.

652
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,690
How big do they get?
Jamie?

653
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:17,190
What a weird name.
Lumber guy or how do you spell it?

654
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:18,540
L A,
m,

655
00:28:18,541 --> 00:28:23,541
m e R G E I r over there.
They described it originally our guy 

656
00:28:23,541 --> 00:28:24,600
described as a griffin

657
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:27,970
but at Griffin's like a mythological.
No,

658
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,940
that's why I was thinking I'm going to 
see this mythological.

659
00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:35,060
I was waiting for something to land and 
talk to us.

660
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:38,790
That's like,
that's a place in New Zealand is like,

661
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,970
that's,
that's a perfect location.

662
00:28:41,971 --> 00:28:46,971
If they ever decided to do like some 
sort of a Jurassic Park taught 

663
00:28:46,971 --> 00:28:46,971
actuation.
Well even Lanai,

664
00:28:46,971 --> 00:28:48,480
right?
Four feet tall.

665
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,220
Nine foot wings hair.
It is.

666
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,810
Wow Man.
Again.

667
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:53,850
We'll get this weight.
Fifteen pounds.

668
00:28:54,450 --> 00:28:56,370
That's crazy.
I'd be nine foot.

669
00:28:56,490 --> 00:29:01,490
What was your goal for the Egyptian 
vulture?

670
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:07,370
I'm going to have.
I'm going to have dreams about this 

671
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:07,370
podcast.
That's its closest relative.

672
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:07,680
What the fuck?
Isn't it crazy?

673
00:29:07,681 --> 00:29:09,870
That nature just designed a really 
creepy,

674
00:29:09,871 --> 00:29:14,280
shitty looking animal to come down and 
eat all the dead shit.

675
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:15,660
Like that picture from right there.

676
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:17,510
MMM.

677
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:21,390
It looks old as fuck when it looks like 
it could be in Nepal or Tibet.

678
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:25,020
Over hunting has led to the endangerment
of the species.

679
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:25,900
Hmm.

680
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:32,280
It's just um,
it's weird how nature has evolved these 

681
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:32,620
animals or they have evolved to develop 
this,

682
00:29:32,650 --> 00:29:36,220
that weird look like vultures like look 
disgusting,

683
00:29:38,050 --> 00:29:39,420
but like,
look at that things face.

684
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:44,760
There's something about the way nature 
has evolved or they have evolved and 

685
00:29:45,701 --> 00:29:46,510
they're not.
Yeah.

686
00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:48,850
It's scary.
Yeah.

687
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:51,650
Cute animals are delicious.
Bright.

688
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,390
A rabbit?
Yeah.

689
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,520
Yeah.
Delicious.

690
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:55,510
Dear,
dear.

691
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:56,470
Delicious,
delicious,

692
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:58,510
gorgeous animals.
Right?

693
00:29:58,511 --> 00:30:01,060
Like if you eat a bear,
like some people think bear acute,

694
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:03,930
but you got to cook the shit out of it.
Yeah.

695
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,760
Can we.
Let's address something right now.

696
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:09,100
Okay.
Bear meat is is good.

697
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:10,570
It's very good.
It's very good.

698
00:30:10,571 --> 00:30:12,390
Yeah.
It can be depending upon what they.

699
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,750
Depending on what they eat,
where you're at.

700
00:30:13,751 --> 00:30:15,760
Like if you're going in September to 
Prince of Wales,

701
00:30:15,761 --> 00:30:20,761
Alaska and you shoot one and it's just 
been eating salmon for a couple of 

702
00:30:20,761 --> 00:30:20,761
weeks,
clams on the beach.

703
00:30:20,761 --> 00:30:21,610
You don't want to eat that thing.
Right.

704
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:25,110
If you go somewhere where we're good 
vegetation and it's,

705
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:27,430
it's well,
it's got a lot of fat on it.

706
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:31,360
It can be good.
I would argue it's not to be celebrated.

707
00:30:31,361 --> 00:30:33,400
Like it's not that good.
It's,

708
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:35,980
it is not as well.
Depends.

709
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:39,490
Apparently if you eat a blueberry bear 
is one of the best meats ever.

710
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:42,870
Yeah.
Never raves about for Nella does I?

711
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:48,360
I've had,
I've eaten a lot of bears and I like 

712
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:48,360
eating them.
I'm not,

713
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,930
I wouldn't throw them away or whatever,
so I would continue to hunt them,

714
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:54,540
but I've never had that same feeling of 
like an elp tenderloin or elk backstrap,

715
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:57,370
like it's just not an x or an access,
it's not in that category.

716
00:30:57,371 --> 00:31:02,371
So I feel like maybe we overcompensate a
little bit because there's so much 

717
00:31:02,371 --> 00:31:02,371
pushback on bear hunting.

718
00:31:02,371 --> 00:31:06,900
Right.
We started talking about how great it 

719
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:06,900
is,
how great it is.

720
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:06,900
It's really good,
but it's not like it's not.

721
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:09,480
It doesn't get that next level.
Have you had smoked bear ham though?

722
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,980
I have.
That's pretty damn good.

723
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:14,380
But that's one of those things where 
it's like it's smoked,

724
00:31:14,381 --> 00:31:17,710
it's Brian treated us and that's the 
biggest thing.

725
00:31:17,711 --> 00:31:20,430
Right.
And you can most meats that you're going

726
00:31:20,431 --> 00:31:21,760
to go hunting for,
you treat,

727
00:31:21,761 --> 00:31:24,220
you look at the cut of meat and you 
treat it accordingly.

728
00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:25,630
Right.
And so there's no,

729
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:31,380
you have to obviously cut the chicken 
gnosis you have to cook a bear all the 

730
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:33,310
way through to a certain temperature,
so that may be b,

731
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:35,170
because I love rare meat.
That may be my problem.

732
00:31:35,171 --> 00:31:37,330
I don't know,
but I think maybe I think maybe a little

733
00:31:37,331 --> 00:31:40,210
bit we could address the fact that 
hunters a little bit of over compensated

734
00:31:40,211 --> 00:31:45,211
for the fact that people are pushing 
back on them so much and that they're 

735
00:31:45,211 --> 00:31:45,211
like,
I love bear.

736
00:31:45,211 --> 00:31:46,170
It's like it's good.
Right?

737
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,920
But I wouldn't choose it.
My favorite.

738
00:31:47,921 --> 00:31:49,430
I wouldn't choose it over a lot of other
meats.

739
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:50,620
Right.
If you have bad,

740
00:31:50,621 --> 00:31:53,800
but like if someone told me you have to 
pick one animal forever,

741
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:57,190
I'd probably say elk and bear would be 
pretty far down the list.

742
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:02,440
Wouldn't,
it wouldn't make it in the top three or 

743
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:02,440
four?
It would be all.

744
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:05,760
Well that's again the thing that you 
just said like I like eating things 

745
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,760
medium rare or rare.
That's where they taste the best.

746
00:32:06,761 --> 00:32:07,930
Yes.
Yeah.

747
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:11,570
And so like I'm not,
I would never put somebody down for one.

748
00:32:12,010 --> 00:32:13,450
I love Barbie doll.
You did all the time.

749
00:32:13,451 --> 00:32:15,040
That's great.
I just,

750
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:17,170
that's a point I've always thought in my
head,

751
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:20,470
I always thought in my head it's like 
people like large mouth,

752
00:32:20,471 --> 00:32:25,471
bass fishing,
but if you go to a restaurant and they 

753
00:32:25,471 --> 00:32:28,441
have large mouth bass right next to the 
Chilean sea bass and you pick the large 

754
00:32:28,441 --> 00:32:29,500
mouth bass are kind of an outline to 
yourself.

755
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:30,160
Yeah.
Like,

756
00:32:30,161 --> 00:32:31,180
come on man.
Yeah,

757
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,160
it doesn't taste that good.
It's okay.

758
00:32:33,161 --> 00:32:34,570
It's edible.
It's edible.

759
00:32:34,571 --> 00:32:39,571
It's really good.
I mean if you took a poll because large 

760
00:32:39,571 --> 00:32:40,130
mouth bass tastes bear way better than 
large

761
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:42,590
mouth bass for gay.
We're going down the track,

762
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:48,070
like large mouth bass just doesn't taste
that tastes better than large mouth 

763
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:48,070
bass.
Large mouth.

764
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:48,710
No.
So.

765
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:51,930
Okay,
so delicious.

766
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:53,880
Fresh water fish.
Delicious.

767
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,270
Go to Alaska and they're everywhere.
Yeah.

768
00:32:56,450 --> 00:32:56,870
Yeah.

769
00:32:57,470 --> 00:32:58,450
Um,
but yeah,

770
00:32:58,451 --> 00:33:00,040
I'm to,
I'm not much of a fish eater.

771
00:33:00,041 --> 00:33:00,370
Anyway.

772
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:04,880
John Barklow from Sitka was in Vegas 
this past weekend and we did.

773
00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:06,030
Yeah,
he's a great guy.

774
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:10,800
Him and Dave brinker were there and he 
was talking about how um,

775
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:15,860
I love that guy to leave Michigan.
Uh,

776
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:21,540
but John was talking about how he 
actually enjoyed a brown bear meat and I

777
00:33:23,731 --> 00:33:24,480
was like,
really?

778
00:33:24,690 --> 00:33:25,590
And he's like,
he goes,

779
00:33:25,591 --> 00:33:27,840
it tasted like a mule deer roast.
Like he goes,

780
00:33:27,841 --> 00:33:32,841
I made it,
I gave it to people at parties and he 

781
00:33:32,841 --> 00:33:35,181
said he put it on,
like he cut it up into cubes and put 

782
00:33:35,181 --> 00:33:38,661
little toothpicks in it and handed it 
out like as hors d'oeuvres at a party 

783
00:33:38,661 --> 00:33:38,670
and people are eating and they're like,
wow,

784
00:33:38,671 --> 00:33:40,140
this is delicious.
What is it?

785
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,730
And he goes,
it's a brown bear.

786
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:45,870
And people got mad at him.
Of course they say it's a person.

787
00:33:46,170 --> 00:33:48,570
I love that he did it.
I love that he did it though.

788
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,550
I support fully support that idea.
Right.

789
00:33:50,551 --> 00:33:55,551
But I would assume that if someone like 
John who works for [inaudible] is 

790
00:33:55,551 --> 00:33:58,440
probably the number one hunting gear,
clothing company in the world.

791
00:33:58,441 --> 00:34:02,070
John is a wealth of knowledge all the 
way through and you know,

792
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:05,010
had a considerable amount experience in 
the military.

793
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:10,250
I would imagine the people that would 
come to his house for a party would be 

794
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:12,030
normalized to happened in La if you did.
If you did that,

795
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:13,890
God,
they go crazy.

796
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:14,910
Yeah,
there'd be a,

797
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,030
there'd be riots.
Yeah.

798
00:34:16,031 --> 00:34:21,031
You should see the look on people's 
faces when my kids tell them that 

799
00:34:21,031 --> 00:34:22,770
they've eaten bear because you know,
when the kids were like five and six,

800
00:34:22,771 --> 00:34:24,780
like I've eaten.
I ate a.

801
00:34:24,910 --> 00:34:29,910
It was awesome.
Do they have that like fierce look in 

802
00:34:29,910 --> 00:34:31,920
their eyes like you just had to bear.
I think it's fun to freak people out.

803
00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:37,310
I do like that sausage and Doris Acute.
That's a wonderful thing coming out of 

804
00:34:37,741 --> 00:34:38,740
there.
It's weird,

805
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:39,850
right?
It's,

806
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,690
you know,
the bear thing is a very strange one.

807
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:45,780
And I um,
I definitely don't like hunting them.

808
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:47,160
Like I like hunting.
Anything else

809
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,450
I struggle with that.
Like I as a hunter,

810
00:34:49,451 --> 00:34:51,070
I feel like coming on and talking as a 
hunter,

811
00:34:51,071 --> 00:34:53,470
I don't want to like disparate disparage
anything,

812
00:34:53,471 --> 00:34:56,620
but I also just want to be 100 percent 
honest about every part of it.

813
00:34:56,990 --> 00:35:01,990
And hunting is really complex activity 
and I feel conflicted about it almost 

814
00:35:02,381 --> 00:35:04,810
every time I go.
Like not about killing the enemy,

815
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:09,811
we're hunting,
but just about little parts of what's 

816
00:35:09,811 --> 00:35:09,811
going on.
Yeah,

817
00:35:09,811 --> 00:35:12,450
and so bear hunting,
so sometimes you just want to like 

818
00:35:12,450 --> 00:35:14,430
Rinella said this once,
and I never understood it until it 

819
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:14,430
happened to me.
He's like,

820
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:18,180
I just want to watch them.
Sometimes I don't really want to hunt 

821
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:18,610
them and it's.
It's what is hunting anyway.

822
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,080
It's hunting,
killing or was hunting,

823
00:35:20,081 --> 00:35:22,450
getting close enough to like shake their
hand saying,

824
00:35:22,570 --> 00:35:23,350
yeah,
it's the whole thing.

825
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:28,590
I think my opinion on that specific 
point is one I would go back to.

826
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:34,590
I always ask myself two questions,
why are you going and and does this 

827
00:35:34,810 --> 00:35:39,810
hunting benefit the place and the animal
that you're hunting and if I can't 

828
00:35:39,810 --> 00:35:44,721
answer those questions myself and I 
always strip away conservation and meat 

829
00:35:44,721 --> 00:35:47,040
from the first question,
will you have a very good way of looking

830
00:35:47,041 --> 00:35:48,510
at this?
I think is very honest.

831
00:35:48,511 --> 00:35:53,511
I think this is super important is that 
conservation is essentially a side 

832
00:35:53,511 --> 00:35:57,741
effect of hunting.
That's a byproduct and to pretend that 

833
00:35:57,741 --> 00:35:58,710
it's the whole thing,
it's almost like a weird.

834
00:35:58,830 --> 00:36:03,830
It's,
it's a disingenuous approach to the 

835
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:06,441
argument,
like really saying you shouldn't be 

836
00:36:06,441 --> 00:36:06,441
hunting will say,
well,

837
00:36:06,441 --> 00:36:06,840
hunting is conservation and hunters of 
the best conservationists.

838
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:08,370
Okay,
that's funny.

839
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:09,840
That's true.
But it's not as true,

840
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:11,170
but it's not really why you're doing 
there.

841
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:16,190
And there's the,
here's the biggest point to make there 

842
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:16,190
semantic chinks in that armor,
right?

843
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:17,330
We've built up over the years as 
hunters.

844
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:20,870
They usually organic meat and 
conservation as this like armor,

845
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:23,400
right?
That insulates why we go.

846
00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:28,970
And I think there's just chinks in that 
armor that if we don't recognize those 

847
00:36:28,970 --> 00:36:29,420
points,
especially the conservation,

848
00:36:29,421 --> 00:36:34,421
when I think that's a bigger deal,
like conservation hunting is a tool for 

849
00:36:34,421 --> 00:36:38,481
conservation.
It's the same way as translocation is a 

850
00:36:38,481 --> 00:36:38,481
tool conservationist.
Um,

851
00:36:38,481 --> 00:36:41,130
you can move the animal to get them away
from a certain situation,

852
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:45,410
uh,
reintroduce animal fats one way or bring

853
00:36:45,411 --> 00:36:48,360
in hunters and help manage the 
population that way.

854
00:36:48,361 --> 00:36:50,130
But it's that first question,
right,

855
00:36:50,131 --> 00:36:55,131
is why do I go?
And I always say it's like we've had 

856
00:36:55,321 --> 00:37:00,321
experiences,
you and I together in the woods that I 

857
00:37:00,321 --> 00:37:00,321
wouldn't,
we couldn't replicate anywhere else.

858
00:37:00,321 --> 00:37:04,430
Like you've done a lot of cool shit and 
there's some like when you ran down the 

859
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:08,541
road after I shot my moods,
like there's just something about that 

860
00:37:08,541 --> 00:37:12,831
for me that is way more fulfilling and 
enriching to my life than any other 

861
00:37:12,831 --> 00:37:13,590
thing I've experienced.

862
00:37:13,970 --> 00:37:17,400
I haven't experienced everything,
but all the things that I've done well,

863
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:18,810
it's so primal.
Right?

864
00:37:18,811 --> 00:37:21,150
And so it's that.
It's learning about animals.

865
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:26,260
You're in the woods too.
You're also in a really almost like 

866
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:26,520
you're a visitor in an alien world.
Exactly.

867
00:37:26,521 --> 00:37:28,460
And so you learn about these animals,
you,

868
00:37:28,461 --> 00:37:33,461
you developed skills,
I feel like you wouldn't develop any 

869
00:37:33,461 --> 00:37:34,350
other way.
So and on and on it goes.

870
00:37:34,351 --> 00:37:39,351
I mean there's probably a 100 reasons 
that I and I discover a new one every 

871
00:37:39,351 --> 00:37:42,771
time I go.
And so I always say like that's the 

872
00:37:42,771 --> 00:37:42,771
answer to the first question,
why do I go?

873
00:37:42,771 --> 00:37:43,410
It's not like,
man,

874
00:37:43,411 --> 00:37:45,840
I'm real hungry and I want to control 
the population.

875
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:51,200
I'm aware as I go hunting that the two,
those two things are byproducts of my 

876
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:54,831
efforts,
then they're always going to be 

877
00:37:54,831 --> 00:37:54,831
byproducts of my efforts unless I'm 
poaching.

878
00:37:54,831 --> 00:37:54,831
Right.
You know,

879
00:37:54,831 --> 00:37:55,060
I'm,
I'm,

880
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:58,290
there is a biologist,
a state wildlife biologist,

881
00:37:58,291 --> 00:38:01,560
federal biologists that determine what 
tags go where,

882
00:38:01,561 --> 00:38:06,561
what animals,
they're moving pieces of the puzzle 

883
00:38:06,561 --> 00:38:06,561
around to keep this thing the way it is.
Right.

884
00:38:06,561 --> 00:38:07,740
Keep it healthy,
keep it stable,

885
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:11,880
but they're also looking at what's the 
economic impact of that all that's going

886
00:38:11,881 --> 00:38:15,060
on while I'm out there thinking I gotta 
kill this big buck,

887
00:38:15,330 --> 00:38:17,400
but I'm not thinking while I'm out there
with my bow,

888
00:38:17,401 --> 00:38:19,200
I'm not thinking,
well,

889
00:38:19,201 --> 00:38:21,750
I'd like to kill that one because 
that'll really stabilize this area,

890
00:38:22,410 --> 00:38:26,100
but I'm out there and kill that one 
because I really liked backstraps.

891
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:31,190
I know those two things are happening,
but they're almost like be pulled that 

892
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:34,821
away from,
from what's actually going on and focus 

893
00:38:34,821 --> 00:38:34,821
on why you're there.
Like,

894
00:38:34,821 --> 00:38:36,050
why don't you go,
why did you go to Lanai?

895
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,440
Like what somebody said,
why did you go,

896
00:38:38,770 --> 00:38:40,540
what would you say?
Two reasons.

897
00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:41,640
One,
um,

898
00:38:41,850 --> 00:38:46,850
to bowhunt for me for sure because I 
want her to eat access to here and two,

899
00:38:47,021 --> 00:38:49,750
because I think that it's great 
practice.

900
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:54,610
One of the hardest things about bow 
hunting is just you can practice all day

901
00:38:54,611 --> 00:38:57,670
on a target,
but it's almost like never sparring.

902
00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:00,550
Like you could practice all day hitting 
a heavy bag,

903
00:39:00,551 --> 00:39:02,750
but you've never had hit a person.
Right?

904
00:39:02,770 --> 00:39:05,170
Like once you're in front of a person,
things get weird,

905
00:39:05,450 --> 00:39:06,850
but when there's a chink in the armor,
right?

906
00:39:06,851 --> 00:39:08,320
So you say,
I practice on an animal,

907
00:39:08,321 --> 00:39:10,570
that's terrible.
I would say to that,

908
00:39:10,571 --> 00:39:14,680
like that that's just another chink in 
the armor that we all know is happening.

909
00:39:14,681 --> 00:39:17,050
Like if we were conservation,
so we would never pick up a bill.

910
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:18,990
Yeah.
But I'm not practicing on an animal.

911
00:39:19,010 --> 00:39:20,500
Look,
I've never practiced before.

912
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:26,630
Texting maybe be in the wrong term.
Like there's something in there that 

913
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:29,191
like the experience of stalking an 
animal is pretty visceral and if you've 

914
00:39:29,191 --> 00:39:33,091
never done it,
you shoot your back on the hell you 

915
00:39:33,091 --> 00:39:33,091
want.
Well,

916
00:39:33,091 --> 00:39:35,970
I say practice in terms of like when you
compete as a a young martial artists,

917
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:41,550
it's not really practice,
but it is like you're involved in 

918
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:45,091
competition,
so like are you hunting or are you 

919
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:45,091
practicing?
We are definitely hunting,

920
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:49,410
but that hunting is practice for other 
hunts or you don't get nearly as many 

921
00:39:49,410 --> 00:39:54,181
opportunities as you do in Lanai.
Lanai is one of the best examples of a 

922
00:39:54,181 --> 00:39:57,040
place that has no predators in a real 
problem with overpopulation.

923
00:39:57,340 --> 00:40:02,340
You were with me in Dudley that one time
where me and him and his son were were 

924
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:07,261
hanging out and we were there at last 
light and we were watching these access 

925
00:40:07,261 --> 00:40:11,770
deer come off the mountain and we saw 
how many hundreds.

926
00:40:11,770 --> 00:40:14,980
I mean it might've been seven,
800 deer coming off this mountain and we

927
00:40:14,981 --> 00:40:16,270
were like,
what the fuck?

928
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:17,890
It was just crazy.
There's 10 more,

929
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,540
there's five more,
there's six more,

930
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:21,580
there's 11 more.
There's a herd of 20.

931
00:40:21,730 --> 00:40:26,730
Like what the fuck?
It got to the point where like this is 

932
00:40:26,730 --> 00:40:26,730
crazy.
So in a place like that,

933
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:31,980
I feel like you have a,
a great ethical argument for like 

934
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:34,360
they're going to shoot these animals,
period.

935
00:40:34,570 --> 00:40:39,570
And the only other way to get around it 
is you bring in wolves and if you bring 

936
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:41,050
in wolves,
wolves,

937
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:45,570
and these people also have dogs running 
around on the streets and like pet dogs,

938
00:40:45,590 --> 00:40:50,590
those dogs that get fucked.
Like immediately they're going to get 

939
00:40:50,590 --> 00:40:52,771
killed by wolves.
Wolves want to take out all the 

940
00:40:52,771 --> 00:40:52,771
possible.
You can't have wolves on the NIH.

941
00:40:52,771 --> 00:40:54,390
It's a stupid idea.
Let's,

942
00:40:54,430 --> 00:40:55,750
hey,
everybody is stopped.

943
00:40:55,750 --> 00:40:57,040
We're never going to do that.
But.

944
00:40:57,041 --> 00:41:02,041
So it's one of it in terms of like since
since the animals are there and there's 

945
00:41:02,531 --> 00:41:05,650
no talk of eradicating them because they
have a real value.

946
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:08,080
The people that live there live off of 
them,

947
00:41:08,410 --> 00:41:09,940
like all those folks that we were 
hanging out with,

948
00:41:09,941 --> 00:41:14,941
like Romano,
a lot of the people that work at that 

949
00:41:14,941 --> 00:41:17,791
place,
they eat access all the time and it is 

950
00:41:17,791 --> 00:41:17,791
without a doubt,
not an oh,

951
00:41:17,791 --> 00:41:22,330
it is the opposite of it is the most 
delicious game me in the world.

952
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:23,760
If it's not,
if it's not,

953
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:27,760
if it's not number one,
it's number two.

954
00:41:28,270 --> 00:41:30,460
It's amazing.
It's so good.

955
00:41:30,461 --> 00:41:33,690
Like we hated it at the restaurant.
They served at a restaurant and remember

956
00:41:33,691 --> 00:41:34,040
the burger

957
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:36,110
we had that one lunch.
Oh my gosh.

958
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:39,170
And then the state police,
the state place at that place.

959
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:41,000
Terrible.
Terrible meaning?

960
00:41:41,001 --> 00:41:43,000
Good.
Terribly terrible.

961
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:43,390
Like,
Hey,

962
00:41:43,490 --> 00:41:45,950
I can't get it out of my mind thinking,
oh yeah,

963
00:41:45,951 --> 00:41:47,230
that's what it was.
They were sliders.

964
00:41:47,231 --> 00:41:52,231
Yeah.
But that's the restaurant serves 

965
00:41:52,231 --> 00:41:53,030
tenderloin and it is phenomenal.
It's so good.

966
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:58,780
So why would I.
that's why one thing I always try to 

967
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:02,140
separate and I try to do it only because
I think I try to look at it from someone

968
00:42:02,721 --> 00:42:06,950
else who is a non hunter and is hearing 
us talk or hearing me talk and whatever.

969
00:42:07,310 --> 00:42:09,230
And maybe thinking like that's a weird 
part of that.

970
00:42:09,410 --> 00:42:10,820
Like,
that's strange.

971
00:42:11,210 --> 00:42:14,660
And so I feel like if I can say yes,
the meat is delicious.

972
00:42:14,690 --> 00:42:16,760
Yes.
They got to kill these things.

973
00:42:16,761 --> 00:42:21,761
Yes.
The local people value the animal 

974
00:42:21,761 --> 00:42:21,761
because hunters exist,
you know,

975
00:42:21,761 --> 00:42:23,030
they,
they wouldn't just gun them down because

976
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:24,470
hunters will pay to go out there.

977
00:42:24,830 --> 00:42:27,680
All those things.
I think set aside,

978
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:33,400
what am I there for?
Like we were that group of hunters we 

979
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:35,150
had in camp was probably.
I mean I've hunted with a lot of awesome

980
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:40,660
talented folks,
was probably the most skilled group of 

981
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:41,140
hunters I've ever been around when 
thinking about who we have.

982
00:42:41,141 --> 00:42:44,270
We have John Dudley is arguably,
if not the best bowhunter in the world.

983
00:42:44,271 --> 00:42:45,850
He's in the top three.
I think it's like,

984
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:48,620
it's like John.
Well there's like top four,

985
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:51,420
like John Kamm,
Remy and uh,

986
00:42:51,470 --> 00:42:53,050
Adam.
Adam Green Tree.

987
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:54,770
Yeah.
They might be all the people that funded

988
00:42:54,771 --> 00:42:56,030
with that top four,
I would say.

989
00:42:56,150 --> 00:42:59,300
I think they might be the top four in 
the world and if they're not top four,

990
00:42:59,301 --> 00:43:03,500
they're all during the top 10 cs.
If you think you're better,

991
00:43:03,501 --> 00:43:05,180
come see us.
A clan of killers.

992
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:10,480
I mean,
and then you've got Shane Dorian is a 

993
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:12,761
great bowl,
hundred two and it's a big wave surfer 

994
00:43:12,761 --> 00:43:12,761
in the world.

995
00:43:12,761 --> 00:43:13,010
Say about Shane.
He's fanatical,

996
00:43:13,310 --> 00:43:14,660
like he would just,
I'd be like,

997
00:43:14,661 --> 00:43:19,661
Hey Shane,
you want to let go take a break and get 

998
00:43:19,661 --> 00:43:19,661
a sandwich?
And he'd looked at me like,

999
00:43:19,661 --> 00:43:19,700
what?
Yeah.

1000
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:20,270
He's like,
no,

1001
00:43:20,330 --> 00:43:22,130
we can be hunting.
Why would we be eating sandwiches?

1002
00:43:22,310 --> 00:43:24,100
He was out there all day,
every day,

1003
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:29,101
all day.
Then he didn't come in during lunchtime 

1004
00:43:29,101 --> 00:43:29,660
when everybody else was in [inaudible].
It was 95 degrees outside.

1005
00:43:29,661 --> 00:43:31,250
Yeah,
he's out there on his hands and knees,

1006
00:43:31,251 --> 00:43:32,980
crawling bushes.
It's crawling,

1007
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:37,910
hoping to find one slip and this girl 
just forever to crawl it for me.

1008
00:43:37,911 --> 00:43:42,911
Like one reason to do that,
stripping away all the things that I 

1009
00:43:42,911 --> 00:43:47,051
know to be right.
Right in my own mind was that was those 

1010
00:43:47,051 --> 00:43:47,730
people getting them all together?
Yeah,

1011
00:43:47,731 --> 00:43:50,720
and then like meat and Roman and me and 
Brandon and meet Alec.

1012
00:43:50,990 --> 00:43:52,820
All our guides and all the locals that 
were there,

1013
00:43:52,821 --> 00:43:57,821
like there's things I and I learned more
about the quick twitch muscle and the 

1014
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:58,820
gut,
dear.

1015
00:43:58,910 --> 00:44:00,350
Oh my God.
Than I've ever learned.

1016
00:44:00,351 --> 00:44:03,470
So I feel like I've learned something.
I spent time with these people that made

1017
00:44:03,471 --> 00:44:05,900
me better at not just hunting,
but everything.

1018
00:44:06,190 --> 00:44:11,190
Well for people who've never been around
and access to hear before they evolved 

1019
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:11,870
with tigers.
Tigers hunt them.

1020
00:44:12,170 --> 00:44:17,170
I mean,
you have never seen an animal more fast 

1021
00:44:17,170 --> 00:44:17,300
in your life.
How about the one deer that we shot?

1022
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:19,670
I shot this deer.
It was 60 yards away.

1023
00:44:19,671 --> 00:44:22,400
It was looking at me and I was like,
I think I'm going to shoot it.

1024
00:44:22,610 --> 00:44:25,280
It's just standing there.
By the time I got there,

1025
00:44:25,281 --> 00:44:28,280
it was four or five deer away.
It was swimming to Maui.

1026
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:32,370
It was at a little.
It build a boat and it was over 60

1027
00:44:32,370 --> 00:44:37,370
yards away.
The arrows going 275 feet a second and 

1028
00:44:37,370 --> 00:44:39,720
it was nowhere near it.
By the time it got there.

1029
00:44:39,721 --> 00:44:41,300
It's like,
please,

1030
00:44:42,030 --> 00:44:43,800
there's so fast.
They're fascinating.

1031
00:44:43,801 --> 00:44:45,120
Any animal I've ever seen.
Well,

1032
00:44:45,121 --> 00:44:50,121
would that lets you say like what a 
weird scenario to be hunting an animal 

1033
00:44:50,121 --> 00:44:51,160
that has been trained by tigers to 
avoid.

1034
00:44:51,190 --> 00:44:53,130
You know,
what a weird thing.

1035
00:44:53,131 --> 00:44:54,930
So like that.
That's my appreciation.

1036
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:57,060
That little,
that little exchange of,

1037
00:44:57,070 --> 00:44:59,040
hey,
me and tigers both hunted this thing,

1038
00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:01,290
like that's,
that's something cool to me,

1039
00:45:01,291 --> 00:45:03,000
that's a,
that's outside of this thing.

1040
00:45:03,001 --> 00:45:05,610
So talking about that all day with it 
and then the meat.

1041
00:45:05,611 --> 00:45:10,611
Look if you're gonna,
if you're a person who values animal 

1042
00:45:10,611 --> 00:45:13,521
protein,
if you like ethically sourced animal 

1043
00:45:13,521 --> 00:45:14,180
protein,
there's no better way to get it than,

1044
00:45:14,210 --> 00:45:17,400
than like a place like Lanai,
like all the pieces are in check.

1045
00:45:17,401 --> 00:45:18,270
Do they need to kill them?

1046
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:20,340
Yes.
Is there an overpopulation problem?

1047
00:45:20,341 --> 00:45:21,850
Yes.
Provide jobs for local.

1048
00:45:21,851 --> 00:45:22,340
Yes.
Yes.

1049
00:45:22,350 --> 00:45:23,520
Yeah.
All the good things.

1050
00:45:23,521 --> 00:45:25,980
I mean there's a lot of positive sides 
to it.

1051
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:27,030
Yeah.
And again,

1052
00:45:27,031 --> 00:45:28,890
if you're someone who enjoys bowhunting,
like,

1053
00:45:29,070 --> 00:45:34,070
look,
it's an uncomfortable thing for some 

1054
00:45:34,070 --> 00:45:34,070
people,
but I enjoy it.

1055
00:45:34,070 --> 00:45:34,260
I like it.
I like getting my meat that way.

1056
00:45:34,350 --> 00:45:38,070
I don't like,
I feel bad if I get bacon from a store.

1057
00:45:38,071 --> 00:45:43,071
I feel like.
Are we talking about like a as 

1058
00:45:43,071 --> 00:45:43,071
predators,
like we are predators.

1059
00:45:43,071 --> 00:45:43,071
If you look at,
you know,

1060
00:45:43,071 --> 00:45:45,450
it's been millions of years.
We've been killing eating things.

1061
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:48,870
New humans are herbivores and that's all
a lie.

1062
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:51,060
I don't know,
I've done some reading and Predator.

1063
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:52,290
Look,
you don't have to be a predator.

1064
00:45:52,450 --> 00:45:55,450
You could live off of,
but aren't we though we up.

1065
00:45:55,470 --> 00:45:56,920
Some people.
Look,

1066
00:45:56,940 --> 00:45:58,770
you can live by point is if you want it 
to.

1067
00:45:58,771 --> 00:46:00,750
I don't want to disparage away anybody 
lives there live.

1068
00:46:00,990 --> 00:46:03,180
You could live off of just pure 
vegetables.

1069
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:08,360
You could live off it and by the way,
there's a real moral and ethical 

1070
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:10,881
argument if you are a Vegan to eat 
mollusks folks because monologues are 

1071
00:46:11,971 --> 00:46:16,320
more primitive than most plants.
They don't communicate as much as plants

1072
00:46:16,321 --> 00:46:18,960
do.
They don't have any sense of feeling.

1073
00:46:18,961 --> 00:46:22,380
They have no nerve endings that would 
allow them to feel pain.

1074
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:26,730
They're incredibly simple organisms.
The only thing that we have against them

1075
00:46:26,731 --> 00:46:31,290
in terms of like when we think about 
them as being an animal versus a,

1076
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:32,700
you know,
a plant.

1077
00:46:32,820 --> 00:46:35,670
People think eating a plant is cruelty 
free.

1078
00:46:35,671 --> 00:46:38,190
Eating a mollusk you're killing a living
creature.

1079
00:46:38,191 --> 00:46:40,320
Right?
But that's just because they move.

1080
00:46:40,470 --> 00:46:44,340
But a fucking Venus flytrap moves to and
it's probably 10 times smarter than like

1081
00:46:44,341 --> 00:46:46,710
a scallop.
Like they're not smart.

1082
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:49,100
It's hard to regulate that morality.
It's.

1083
00:46:49,130 --> 00:46:51,030
It is,
but I mean I just want people,

1084
00:46:51,570 --> 00:46:56,570
if you're,
if you're uncomfortable with eating 

1085
00:46:56,570 --> 00:46:56,570
chicken,
I get it,

1086
00:46:56,570 --> 00:46:58,830
but clams and oysters and those things 
are good for you.

1087
00:46:58,860 --> 00:47:02,640
They really are and it's sustainable and
the,

1088
00:47:02,641 --> 00:47:07,641
the,
the animals themselves are not feeling 

1089
00:47:07,641 --> 00:47:07,641
shit.

1090
00:47:07,641 --> 00:47:10,460
Yeah.
The moral entanglements of all of it is 

1091
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:10,460
just like we say,
we're,

1092
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:14,680
we humans.
We wake up in the morning and you 

1093
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:14,680
consume everything like you just 
consuming.

1094
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:16,170
You breathe there.
You pump out CEO too.

1095
00:47:16,171 --> 00:47:19,500
I mean every other animal does too.
They just wander around on the grass and

1096
00:47:19,590 --> 00:47:24,590
consumption engines.
They're like for us to to separate out 

1097
00:47:24,590 --> 00:47:27,330
one part of our consumption and then 
beat the crap out of it.

1098
00:47:27,510 --> 00:47:32,510
Even though we've been doing it for 2 
million years is in and of itself kind 

1099
00:47:32,510 --> 00:47:32,510
of weird.
Well,

1100
00:47:32,510 --> 00:47:34,000
you know what I think happened.
Is your mic on?

1101
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:38,020
That was a weird story.
Loud was weird.

1102
00:47:38,170 --> 00:47:41,200
It was like it was in my ear,
Davies,

1103
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:43,660
Davies on the ride there.
They're getting crazy,

1104
00:47:43,990 --> 00:47:48,760
but I think part of the issue is that 
people over the last hundred years or so

1105
00:47:48,761 --> 00:47:53,761
have been so removed from where the meat
comes from that when they can find a 

1106
00:47:54,011 --> 00:47:55,630
direct connection like,
oh,

1107
00:47:55,870 --> 00:47:58,690
you went and you shot a moose and then 
you ate that move.

1108
00:47:58,690 --> 00:48:00,280
So like you were,
you killed the Moose.

1109
00:48:00,390 --> 00:48:02,740
Like you didn't have to kill that Moose 
like that.

1110
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:07,530
That becomes problematic because people 
aren't used to someone killing things.

1111
00:48:07,550 --> 00:48:09,610
Yeah.
People that they know in particular know

1112
00:48:09,611 --> 00:48:12,250
and I,
I enjoy the ideological conversation.

1113
00:48:12,251 --> 00:48:14,020
I just enjoy the conversation.
Right?

1114
00:48:14,021 --> 00:48:16,840
Like I enjoy it because I think it's 
part of a human condition.

1115
00:48:17,050 --> 00:48:19,120
It's part of who we are and what we do.
So yeah,

1116
00:48:19,121 --> 00:48:24,121
we should probably fight about it a 
little bit and disagree because it's 

1117
00:48:24,121 --> 00:48:26,491
pretty damn important.
Like this is an important piece of our 

1118
00:48:26,491 --> 00:48:26,491
humanity.
It is.

1119
00:48:26,491 --> 00:48:26,491
We're talking about.
So I,

1120
00:48:26,491 --> 00:48:31,260
I feel very strongly that hunting is 
like the essence of who I am as a human 

1121
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:35,371
and has made my life better.
But I can see how somebody else would 

1122
00:48:35,371 --> 00:48:35,740
say that's you're killing stuff I can't 
do.

1123
00:48:35,741 --> 00:48:37,540
And I also think that those people are 
important.

1124
00:48:37,590 --> 00:48:42,590
I think so.
I think having vegans and having animal 

1125
00:48:42,590 --> 00:48:43,150
rights activists and having to be able 
to have dialogue with them,

1126
00:48:43,390 --> 00:48:47,890
it also makes sure that you keep people 
honest,

1127
00:48:48,010 --> 00:48:50,650
like people that are hunters like,
you know,

1128
00:48:50,710 --> 00:48:53,620
like,
because we all know unethical people.

1129
00:48:53,650 --> 00:48:55,780
There's people that are unethical.
Absolutely.

1130
00:48:56,050 --> 00:48:57,940
Look at it.
I always think about it,

1131
00:48:57,941 --> 00:49:02,941
you know,
if you look at the trend of hunting and 

1132
00:49:02,941 --> 00:49:03,790
the seventies hunting was doing great.
And then in the eighties started to tick

1133
00:49:03,791 --> 00:49:05,430
down fucking Bambi.
That's what happened.

1134
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:06,340
You.
Well I would say three.

1135
00:49:06,341 --> 00:49:06,690
We,
I,

1136
00:49:06,850 --> 00:49:08,500
we talked about this before,
like three things.

1137
00:49:08,501 --> 00:49:10,390
Bambi,
maybe Walt Disney.

1138
00:49:10,391 --> 00:49:11,830
He was maybe a Dick,
I don't know.

1139
00:49:12,340 --> 00:49:15,400
Uh,
and then urbanization,

1140
00:49:15,860 --> 00:49:20,860
right?
Which correlated with the client and 

1141
00:49:20,860 --> 00:49:20,860
hunting.
And then hunters being the third one.

1142
00:49:20,860 --> 00:49:25,830
Messaging we have a bad were bad pr.
Some of them are bad pr agents and 

1143
00:49:25,830 --> 00:49:27,190
people like Rinella that are amazing at 
it.

1144
00:49:27,250 --> 00:49:32,250
We're way better now than we were five 
years ago with better tomorrow than we 

1145
00:49:32,250 --> 00:49:32,650
were yesterday.
But I think like in general,

1146
00:49:32,651 --> 00:49:34,810
like if you look at that line graph 
right in the seventies,

1147
00:49:34,811 --> 00:49:39,811
it was going nicely in the eighties.
It started to decline and I think 2011 

1148
00:49:39,811 --> 00:49:40,630
was the first time.
It actually went up.

1149
00:49:40,890 --> 00:49:45,890
A real number of.
I think it's the licensed sales or 

1150
00:49:45,890 --> 00:49:45,890
number of hunters participating.
I wonder what caused the.

1151
00:49:45,890 --> 00:49:49,180
That's like the organic food.
There was a study that said locavores,

1152
00:49:49,181 --> 00:49:54,181
they're talking about more women.
They talked about returning military 

1153
00:49:54,181 --> 00:49:56,851
members.
I'm around remembering reading the 

1154
00:49:56,851 --> 00:49:56,851
study.
I think those are the top three.

1155
00:49:56,851 --> 00:50:00,751
But I think local Var was probably 
pushed out there as like the way to 

1156
00:50:00,751 --> 00:50:04,111
reverse that second point.
The way to reverse the suburban and 

1157
00:50:04,111 --> 00:50:07,291
urban rise was to take that suburban a 
male or female and say you can get your 

1158
00:50:08,771 --> 00:50:11,920
food right.
And then that's a way to kind of reverse

1159
00:50:11,921 --> 00:50:16,921
the decline.
And I think that's probably what was 

1160
00:50:16,921 --> 00:50:18,730
happening that well everybody wants to 
go with locally sourced,

1161
00:50:18,731 --> 00:50:23,731
locally raised grass fed.
People are trying to go to farmers 

1162
00:50:23,731 --> 00:50:25,930
markets and connect with the people that
are actually growing the animals.

1163
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:28,130
And this is like one step better than

1164
00:50:28,130 --> 00:50:33,130
that,
instead of having an animal that's in 

1165
00:50:33,130 --> 00:50:33,130
captivity,
go out into the forest.

1166
00:50:33,130 --> 00:50:34,490
But there's a rude awakening for a lot 
of these people that think they're going

1167
00:50:34,491 --> 00:50:39,491
to just go ahead and try it.
Like it is not easy by any stretch of 

1168
00:50:39,491 --> 00:50:39,491
the imagination.

1169
00:50:39,491 --> 00:50:41,970
The other problem,
it's the Grand Canyon being I would love

1170
00:50:41,971 --> 00:50:46,971
to.
I would love to procure my own elk meat 

1171
00:50:46,971 --> 00:50:47,540
and killing an elk is like being on two 
sides of the Grand Canyon.

1172
00:50:47,730 --> 00:50:49,730
Like you can't.
There's no bridge to be built there.

1173
00:50:49,740 --> 00:50:54,740
You got to take it one step at a time.
And for most people that's just not the 

1174
00:50:54,740 --> 00:50:54,930
time for that.
They don't have the want to do that.

1175
00:50:55,170 --> 00:51:00,170
So I would say it was there like 14 
million hunters in the world or 

1176
00:51:00,170 --> 00:51:00,170
something like that.
Or in the.

1177
00:51:00,170 --> 00:51:01,890
In our country.
How many,

1178
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:03,170
how many?
Non Hundreds.

1179
00:51:03,171 --> 00:51:06,080
You don't either have the wherewithal to
be,

1180
00:51:06,140 --> 00:51:11,140
to get educated or want to or just don't
fall into the anti on her side,

1181
00:51:11,191 --> 00:51:14,730
like the agnostic crowd.
How many of those are there out there?

1182
00:51:15,590 --> 00:51:20,590
I don't know,
but it's hundreds of millions of people 

1183
00:51:20,590 --> 00:51:20,590
are,
you know,

1184
00:51:20,590 --> 00:51:20,590
there's a lot of them.

1185
00:51:20,810 --> 00:51:25,810
Urbanization.
One of the things it's done just just 

1186
00:51:25,810 --> 00:51:25,810
careers,
careers in cities.

1187
00:51:25,810 --> 00:51:30,251
It's eliminated almost all of your free 
time and if you wanted to go out and 

1188
00:51:30,321 --> 00:51:31,580
procure your own meat,
first of all,

1189
00:51:31,581 --> 00:51:34,580
if you want to do with a rifle,
that's going to take a tremendous amount

1190
00:51:34,581 --> 00:51:36,470
of time,
but if you want to do it with a bow,

1191
00:51:36,740 --> 00:51:40,490
so multiply that by a factor of like 
maybe five or 10,

1192
00:51:40,670 --> 00:51:43,520
maybe 10,
10 is probably pretty honest,

1193
00:51:43,610 --> 00:51:45,800
honestly.
And then you're talking about one of the

1194
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:47,650
hardest pieces is access,
right?

1195
00:51:47,740 --> 00:51:52,740
So even if you.
If you get with John Dudley and you 

1196
00:51:52,740 --> 00:51:55,280
learn how to be a great archer and you 
understand that in your suburban area,

1197
00:51:55,281 --> 00:51:57,710
there are some places where there's deer
that you may kill.

1198
00:51:57,950 --> 00:52:00,860
You got to get access to those places 
and then when you're done with that,

1199
00:52:00,861 --> 00:52:05,861
you've got to figure out a way to get 
that thing from dead deer to meet and 

1200
00:52:05,861 --> 00:52:06,920
all the other things.
So this is just so complex.

1201
00:52:06,921 --> 00:52:09,000
How would you ever expect somebody just 
to be,

1202
00:52:09,010 --> 00:52:11,210
have like a desire?
You were like that at some point.

1203
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:16,670
Well,
Rinella opened the door for me to have 

1204
00:52:16,670 --> 00:52:20,370
that super lucky forever grateful 
because when he took me into a wild back

1205
00:52:21,601 --> 00:52:22,800
country,
Montana.

1206
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:24,240
Yeah,
you got gear in the nuts.

1207
00:52:24,530 --> 00:52:29,530
The first year there was a breaks in the
Missouri breaks in October nine degrees 

1208
00:52:29,611 --> 00:52:34,611
out.
Freezing your dick off every night in a 

1209
00:52:34,611 --> 00:52:34,611
tent,
but it like lifeless,

1210
00:52:34,611 --> 00:52:38,321
Steven Ella.
That's kind of what it's like and that 

1211
00:52:38,321 --> 00:52:38,321
it.
He loves suffering.

1212
00:52:38,321 --> 00:52:38,321
He loves it,
but I love that he loves it.

1213
00:52:38,321 --> 00:52:39,660
He's legit as they come.

1214
00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:41,710
He really is.
I think that's it,

1215
00:52:41,711 --> 00:52:43,180
right?
There is just this,

1216
00:52:43,270 --> 00:52:47,800
there's this big gap and my father got 
me into it but my brother doesn't.

1217
00:52:48,050 --> 00:52:53,050
Doesn't hunt and.
But I think he has a respect for it and 

1218
00:52:53,050 --> 00:52:53,050
understands what's going on.
But he just,

1219
00:52:53,050 --> 00:52:54,430
I think at the time that I was 
introduced to hunting,

1220
00:52:54,670 --> 00:52:59,670
my brother was more interested in going 
out with his friends and Saturday 

1221
00:52:59,670 --> 00:53:02,761
mornings were not for getting up early 
and so we're essentially the same 

1222
00:53:02,761 --> 00:53:06,601
person,
but I just went this way and he didn't 

1223
00:53:06,601 --> 00:53:06,601
go that way.
Right.

1224
00:53:06,601 --> 00:53:06,880
So it's,
it's a weird.

1225
00:53:06,881 --> 00:53:10,450
So you could be in the same house with 
somebody in a different way.

1226
00:53:10,700 --> 00:53:15,700
Well,
Rinella has a real good way of looking 

1227
00:53:15,700 --> 00:53:15,700
at it too.
He's like,

1228
00:53:15,700 --> 00:53:18,091
uh,
I don't expect people to go out and get 

1229
00:53:18,091 --> 00:53:20,021
rid of their own sewage.
Why should I expect them to go out and 

1230
00:53:20,021 --> 00:53:20,540
hunt their own food like you don't have 
to?

1231
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:21,180
Well,
and he's,

1232
00:53:21,190 --> 00:53:22,840
I think he probably said this at some 
point,

1233
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:25,150
um,
or somebody smart did.

1234
00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:28,050
It was like I choose,
I believe,

1235
00:53:28,051 --> 00:53:33,051
that I choosed to meet to be the one 
thing that I grabbed ahold of to bring 

1236
00:53:33,051 --> 00:53:33,690
into my,
to my skill set.

1237
00:53:34,220 --> 00:53:36,060
I don't knit my own clothes.
I don't,

1238
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:39,450
I don't make my own shoes.
I don't build my own houses.

1239
00:53:39,870 --> 00:53:44,870
You know,
we were just looking at some 

1240
00:53:44,870 --> 00:53:44,870
construction stuff a little bit earlier.
I'm like,

1241
00:53:44,870 --> 00:53:44,870
dude,
I what?

1242
00:53:44,870 --> 00:53:45,300
Yeah.
What are they doing?

1243
00:53:45,330 --> 00:53:46,320
What are they doing?
Yeah,

1244
00:53:46,860 --> 00:53:51,860
I couldn't do that.
I just picked this one thing because 

1245
00:53:51,860 --> 00:53:53,040
it's also part of my passion.
So you couldn't just ask someone who's a

1246
00:53:54,180 --> 00:53:56,460
construction worker to go like,
go hunt,

1247
00:53:56,990 --> 00:53:59,190
get some mate.
I know you have a desire for that.

1248
00:53:59,191 --> 00:54:04,191
So that's just another hard part about 
hunting and nonhunters by proxy are 

1249
00:54:04,231 --> 00:54:09,231
essential to hunting always in industry 
and opinion and because we could 

1250
00:54:09,751 --> 00:54:14,751
legislate ourselves out of being able to
hunt that can happen is a privileged 

1251
00:54:14,751 --> 00:54:16,780
man.
That's not a right and a lot of ways and

1252
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:19,020
so that's another whole nother can of 
worms,

1253
00:54:19,021 --> 00:54:20,880
but it could.
It could go away.

1254
00:54:21,130 --> 00:54:22,300
Yeah.
I think the.

1255
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:26,800
The issue is that so many people are 
opposed to it because they're so removed

1256
00:54:26,801 --> 00:54:31,801
from the realities of the wild and they 
just feel some sort of moral superiority

1257
00:54:31,871 --> 00:54:35,590
by either not eating meat entirely or by
not killing their own meat.

1258
00:54:35,820 --> 00:54:37,930
The not killing their own meat is really
ridiculous.

1259
00:54:38,230 --> 00:54:40,120
Like my wife was having a conversation 
with someone,

1260
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:44,980
they were out to dinner with a bunch of 
people while I was on an elk hunt in the

1261
00:54:44,981 --> 00:54:49,981
guy was eating a steak guy from England 
in England and all hunt or they've do 

1262
00:54:49,981 --> 00:54:51,910
hunting foxes and horses and shit.
And they were like,

1263
00:54:51,911 --> 00:54:56,440
tweed pussies England.
We love you guys carving a steak.

1264
00:54:56,530 --> 00:54:57,700
And my wife goes,
oh,

1265
00:54:57,730 --> 00:55:00,280
he's actually out elk hunting.
And the guy goes,

1266
00:55:00,310 --> 00:55:02,110
he hunts.
That's deplorable.

1267
00:55:02,230 --> 00:55:07,230
The guy said,
does deplorable while he's carving a 

1268
00:55:07,230 --> 00:55:07,230
steak.
I was saying something the other day

1269
00:55:07,730 --> 00:55:08,780
and I got.
And I got a lot of,

1270
00:55:08,781 --> 00:55:11,120
like people were looking at me like I 
was weird at work.

1271
00:55:11,420 --> 00:55:13,010
Uh,
one of my buddies that work was eating a

1272
00:55:13,070 --> 00:55:18,070
chicken sandwich from chick filet and I 
look in the bag and there's a cartoon 

1273
00:55:18,070 --> 00:55:19,520
chicken on the bag.
And in my mind I'm like,

1274
00:55:19,540 --> 00:55:24,540
well,
that's like building a swimming pool by 

1275
00:55:24,540 --> 00:55:26,351
the lake.
That's fucking weird irony that that 

1276
00:55:26,351 --> 00:55:26,351
were like saying,
Hey,

1277
00:55:26,351 --> 00:55:28,460
I'm eating the chicken,
but here's a cartoon version of it so we

1278
00:55:28,461 --> 00:55:32,000
can celebrate the fact that we just 
murdered this chicken and we fried it up

1279
00:55:32,130 --> 00:55:37,130
like that doesn't make sense like a 
swimming pool with a lake as smart 

1280
00:55:37,130 --> 00:55:40,691
because it's Paris,
the braids wearing all the time for a 

1281
00:55:40,691 --> 00:55:44,050
refill and it is weird.
That was.

1282
00:55:44,060 --> 00:55:44,570
You know what I mean?

1283
00:55:44,850 --> 00:55:45,240
Well,
we.

1284
00:55:45,420 --> 00:55:48,930
We definitely like to cartoon eyes.
These weird.

1285
00:55:49,060 --> 00:55:50,930
Is that a word?
Not really cartoon.

1286
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:52,720
Personalize.
No.

1287
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:54,190
Well,
anthropomorphize.

1288
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:57,350
As you take an animal and you give it 
human characteristics personify.

1289
00:55:57,710 --> 00:56:00,080
No cartoon of vacation.
Is that a word?

1290
00:56:01,100 --> 00:56:03,530
Just turning it into a fucking cartoon.
Green drinks.

1291
00:56:03,531 --> 00:56:08,531
We'll do what we want.
A sweet little cutie pie when really a 

1292
00:56:08,531 --> 00:56:11,171
chicken is a ruthless little fucking 
dinosaur that lays eggs for you 

1293
00:56:11,171 --> 00:56:11,171
everyday,

1294
00:56:11,171 --> 00:56:15,160
but it isn't.
Is it weird to be eating a chicken and 

1295
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:16,880
like there is where that chicken came 
from.

1296
00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:18,950
Yeah.
It's like a picture of the chicken.

1297
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:22,520
So it kind of a.
seems like a weird way to handle it.

1298
00:56:22,700 --> 00:56:23,500
Well,
it is weird,

1299
00:56:23,530 --> 00:56:24,100
but we liked

1300
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:26,140
cartoons.
People love cartoons.

1301
00:56:26,810 --> 00:56:31,810
Well that's like the personification of 
animals I think is part of the bear 

1302
00:56:31,810 --> 00:56:34,651
situation because my kid,
my son is nine months old and from 

1303
00:56:34,750 --> 00:56:39,750
before he was born until now there's 
cartoon bears everywhere and there's 

1304
00:56:39,750 --> 00:56:40,560
like this,
you know,

1305
00:56:41,470 --> 00:56:46,470
personification of these cute little 
creatures that come along with being a 

1306
00:56:46,470 --> 00:56:49,150
little baby and then.
And then you look at so many a pixar and

1307
00:56:49,151 --> 00:56:51,400
dreamworks films at like personify 
animals.

1308
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:53,650
I think that's,
I mean it's,

1309
00:56:53,740 --> 00:56:55,540
there's some indoctrination into that,
right?

1310
00:56:55,541 --> 00:56:56,200
There has to be.

1311
00:56:56,440 --> 00:57:01,440
There is because in those,
those magazines or rather those movies 

1312
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:05,251
and books,
even those animals will never like 

1313
00:57:05,251 --> 00:57:07,890
eating each other to.
I mean if,

1314
00:57:08,710 --> 00:57:10,450
if like,
if,

1315
00:57:10,850 --> 00:57:14,170
if he killed a hiker,
you know,

1316
00:57:14,171 --> 00:57:19,171
if a hike or fucked up on one of the 
episodes of yellowstone and just took a 

1317
00:57:19,171 --> 00:57:24,061
wrong turn and Yogis,
like eating his rib was bunch of people 

1318
00:57:24,061 --> 00:57:29,041
show up and bear and yoga.
You're just going at it and ripping it 

1319
00:57:29,041 --> 00:57:29,041
apart.
Eating cubs.

1320
00:57:29,041 --> 00:57:33,720
Yeah.
Eating some dude asshole first boys 

1321
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:36,250
screaming and swatting at it with his 
fucking hiking in their plant,

1322
00:57:36,260 --> 00:57:37,660
in the circle of life.
In the background.

1323
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:38,960
Yeah.
Well Go.

1324
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:40,690
Yeah.
There's this.

1325
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:45,220
I feel like there's some indoctrination 
and maybe maybe that's what happens.

1326
00:57:45,221 --> 00:57:50,221
I just don't know.
I have no idea why bears get this thing 

1327
00:57:50,221 --> 00:57:53,461
because bears are around.
It's not like there aren't barriers 

1328
00:57:53,461 --> 00:57:53,461
around there in almost all states aren't
they?

1329
00:57:53,461 --> 00:57:53,590
Like,

1330
00:57:53,900 --> 00:57:56,060
yeah.
But it's what it is is people that don't

1331
00:57:56,210 --> 00:57:59,230
experience them firsthand and when they 
do experience a firsthand,

1332
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:03,560
usually they're in their car like local 
bear and they drive by Tommy

1333
00:58:03,670 --> 00:58:05,620
that one bear that was walking on a 
tight legs.

1334
00:58:05,621 --> 00:58:06,340
And that was cute.

1335
00:58:06,810 --> 00:58:11,810
Oh,
that one that had a broken front paws 

1336
00:58:11,810 --> 00:58:13,631
with friends with that bear.
They called them like pedals or 

1337
00:58:13,631 --> 00:58:13,850
something like that is awesome.
There was um,

1338
00:58:14,070 --> 00:58:19,070
my friend Tommy who lives in Connecticut
sent me a picture of these bears that 

1339
00:58:19,070 --> 00:58:22,860
were in the middle of the street duking 
it out in Connecticut.

1340
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:26,550
Like they're invading Connecticut now 
and they don't have any pressure.

1341
00:58:26,580 --> 00:58:30,000
So here's the thing about bear hunting 
as opposed to anything else,

1342
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:35,360
like California is weird in that they 
don't hunt mountain lions.

1343
00:58:35,820 --> 00:58:40,500
But what's good about that is California
has very little deer now.

1344
00:58:40,501 --> 00:58:44,250
It's not good if you like to hunt deer,
but it is good if you like to drive down

1345
00:58:44,251 --> 00:58:46,290
the street and not slamming a fucking 
deer.

1346
00:58:46,510 --> 00:58:51,150
Like Iowa doesn't have mountain lions,
but they do have a shit ton of deer.

1347
00:58:51,151 --> 00:58:52,980
And when you drive late at night in 
Iowa,

1348
00:58:53,210 --> 00:58:57,180
you got to have your foot on the gas.
We're ready to hit that fucking break at

1349
00:58:57,181 --> 00:58:59,310
any second.
Just get that ranch hand guard garden.

1350
00:58:59,550 --> 00:59:04,550
He's mad.
Max Grill people like everywhere you 

1351
00:59:04,550 --> 00:59:05,630
look.
And like Iowa and Montana,

1352
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:10,080
these people have pickup trucks with 
these battering ram front grill.

1353
00:59:10,081 --> 00:59:11,180
Things that they should I

1354
00:59:11,250 --> 00:59:12,350
deer.
We kill on alumni.

1355
00:59:12,351 --> 00:59:14,230
Were you in any of the deer?
Oh,

1356
00:59:14,231 --> 00:59:16,940
we must've hit a car.
Oh yeah,

1357
00:59:16,941 --> 00:59:21,941
with the Brandon's truck.
I think we hit at least two or three 

1358
00:59:21,941 --> 00:59:21,941
deer.
Did you?

1359
00:59:21,941 --> 00:59:21,941
While we run the night,
we,

1360
00:59:21,941 --> 00:59:26,010
we were there.
Any romanza better driver than Brian 

1361
00:59:26,010 --> 00:59:26,010
must be this.
What's going on?

1362
00:59:26,010 --> 00:59:27,800
And if you're listening,
we never handled tenant to.

1363
00:59:27,830 --> 00:59:29,170
We didn't even hit one.
Yeah,

1364
00:59:29,180 --> 00:59:31,510
we hit multiple,
but they were telling me about them.

1365
00:59:31,540 --> 00:59:32,930
They were like,
people just slamming,

1366
00:59:34,300 --> 00:59:39,300
you know,
I'm sure the insurance industry would 

1367
00:59:39,300 --> 00:59:41,441
really enjoy will in Cape Town last year
a guy died because a guy in front of him

1368
00:59:42,411 --> 00:59:47,411
hit a deer and the deer flew through the
air and went through his windshield and 

1369
00:59:47,411 --> 00:59:49,660
brain.
Dumb luck.

1370
00:59:49,730 --> 00:59:53,880
That's a shit luck.
Having a longer term story like that you

1371
00:59:53,881 --> 00:59:56,150
like,
I would have liked to hear that.

1372
00:59:56,150 --> 00:59:58,160
You're like,
I would have done duck as a pussy.

1373
00:59:58,220 --> 00:59:59,400
I'd have been like,
I don't know,

1374
01:00:01,910 --> 01:00:03,190
stupid shit like that.
Right.

1375
01:00:04,730 --> 01:00:07,640
I would have been driving my car and I 
would have seen this deer flying through

1376
01:00:07,641 --> 01:00:08,240
there.
And I'm like,

1377
01:00:08,241 --> 01:00:09,380
well,
it was a good run.

1378
01:00:09,560 --> 01:00:14,240
Like there's,
there's nothing I can do about it.

1379
01:00:14,241 --> 01:00:17,270
It's been a good time and airborne dear.
That's just bad luck.

1380
01:00:17,330 --> 01:00:21,350
The 150 pound blacktail yeah.
Through the air.

1381
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:24,110
What the hell?
Antlers and hooves I'd have been like,

1382
01:00:24,830 --> 01:00:29,830
well it was.
I lived all these years without this 

1383
01:00:29,830 --> 01:00:29,830
happening.
That was lucky.

1384
01:00:29,830 --> 01:00:31,100
That's probably more lucky,
right?

1385
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:32,100
Yeah.
Yeah,

1386
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:33,050
but that's,
I mean,

1387
01:00:33,051 --> 01:00:38,051
you know,
you start to like break down those 

1388
01:00:38,051 --> 01:00:38,051
things like more animals,
less animals,

1389
01:00:38,051 --> 01:00:41,630
the value of them and all these things.
What a complex freaking thing to have to

1390
01:00:41,631 --> 01:00:44,570
figure out.
I always just get more.

1391
01:00:44,570 --> 01:00:45,890
You read,
the more you jump in,

1392
01:00:45,891 --> 01:00:47,120
the more you go,
you know,

1393
01:00:47,270 --> 01:00:50,840
going to New Zealand,
go into,

1394
01:00:51,230 --> 01:00:52,940
in the northwest territories,
going in Nepal,

1395
01:00:52,941 --> 01:00:57,941
you go to these places and you just 
realize that everybody has the same 

1396
01:00:57,941 --> 01:01:00,980
essential problem.
Like how do we cohabitate,

1397
01:01:01,010 --> 01:01:06,010
how do we live with these things that,
that we were in some ways meant to 

1398
01:01:06,010 --> 01:01:07,310
consume.
Like there's evidence of 2 million years

1399
01:01:07,311 --> 01:01:12,311
ago in Tanzania,
a human's early humans hunting and so 

1400
01:01:14,220 --> 01:01:19,220
100,000
generations of people have a sense have 

1401
01:01:19,220 --> 01:01:20,200
lived on the hunter gatherer diet.
You know?

1402
01:01:20,540 --> 01:01:25,540
Then you had the industrial revolution,
couple generations of people kind of 

1403
01:01:25,540 --> 01:01:29,620
were introduced to a new diet and then 
the last couple of generations you have 

1404
01:01:29,620 --> 01:01:32,090
processed foods and so you.
Everywhere that I've ever been,

1405
01:01:32,170 --> 01:01:34,340
you find people are struggling with that
thing.

1406
01:01:34,940 --> 01:01:37,610
It's like it's just not us in America,
right,

1407
01:01:37,611 --> 01:01:40,310
but when you can exist on a plant based 
diet,

1408
01:01:40,420 --> 01:01:45,420
I mean,
I know a lot of people literally 

1409
01:01:45,420 --> 01:01:45,420
absolutely can be done and I'm sure in 
those 100,000

1410
01:01:45,420 --> 01:01:49,490
generations there was plenty of people 
that didn't exist on the hunter gatherer

1411
01:01:49,491 --> 01:01:54,491
diet alone,
but the majority of money there were 

1412
01:01:54,491 --> 01:01:57,100
honestly because I feel like people were
just really super optimal opportunistic 

1413
01:01:57,100 --> 01:01:57,100
back then.

1414
01:01:57,100 --> 01:01:59,030
I mean if you were just trying to 
survive and struggle,

1415
01:01:59,390 --> 01:02:01,490
I don't think you would say like,
Hey,

1416
01:02:01,491 --> 01:02:05,870
I don't want to eat that rabbit.
Rabbit is the way I live,

1417
01:02:05,871 --> 01:02:07,800
and then you have to only where it's 
spelled and the left.

1418
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:12,880
That's a different deal.
I was writing a piece one time and then 

1419
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:15,110
I got into reading about these.
A basket weaver,

1420
01:02:15,111 --> 01:02:17,930
people that were in the valley of fire 
state park in Nevada,

1421
01:02:18,050 --> 01:02:19,770
which is really close to Vegas

1422
01:02:20,610 --> 01:02:22,200
and you should go if you've never been 
up there.

1423
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:23,700
Basket weavers.
Yeah.

1424
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:29,000
Basket basket maker or a basket weaver 
people and they're like native 

1425
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:29,000
Americans.
Yeah.

1426
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,680
They were essentially a roving band of 
nomadic hunters.

1427
01:02:32,070 --> 01:02:33,480
I don't.
I can't think of the year,

1428
01:02:33,481 --> 01:02:38,481
you probably look it up and find it,
but there was different generations of 

1429
01:02:38,481 --> 01:02:40,440
this essentially roving band of tribes 
in that area.

1430
01:02:40,890 --> 01:02:42,930
Next time you're in Vegas,
it's like an hour drive north.

1431
01:02:43,470 --> 01:02:48,470
There's a bunch of petroglyphs that 
depict like dvds and and sheep and all 

1432
01:02:48,751 --> 01:02:49,660
these different things there

1433
01:02:49,770 --> 01:02:54,770
and you can just go visit them.
What's fucked up about those 

1434
01:02:54,770 --> 01:02:54,770
petroglyphs?
Man,

1435
01:02:54,770 --> 01:02:57,330
they're not protected like there's a 
ranch in Texas that a buddy of mine went

1436
01:02:57,331 --> 01:03:02,331
to and he's like,
you could just go over there and touch 

1437
01:03:02,331 --> 01:03:02,460
these things and they might be 5,000
years old.

1438
01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:04,470
I did that when my wife and I went up 
there.

1439
01:03:04,471 --> 01:03:06,490
You could have add a can of spray paint.
They weren't like,

1440
01:03:06,500 --> 01:03:08,310
how fucked up is that?
It's strange.

1441
01:03:08,340 --> 01:03:09,840
It's strange that you wouldn't find a 
way,

1442
01:03:09,841 --> 01:03:12,120
but also probably.
Yeah,

1443
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:14,460
it's probably okay because it's a 
natural occurring.

1444
01:03:14,580 --> 01:03:15,690
You know,
this is a natural place.

1445
01:03:15,691 --> 01:03:17,700
You want to put fences up or no guard 
standing there.

1446
01:03:17,701 --> 01:03:18,640
So what solutions?

1447
01:03:19,270 --> 01:03:20,470
Pretty bad ass that no one's

1448
01:03:20,990 --> 01:03:22,230
so far.
Well,

1449
01:03:22,231 --> 01:03:24,180
and so you'd go up there and you see 
these things and you're like,

1450
01:03:24,181 --> 01:03:29,181
holy crap.
So I started reading a little bit about 

1451
01:03:29,181 --> 01:03:29,181
those people and they were a part of a 
nomadic,

1452
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:34,440
a band of hunters,
gatherers that lived in caves and 

1453
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:35,580
essentially followed a desert bighorn 
sheep,

1454
01:03:35,581 --> 01:03:38,070
much like a end user.
The planes followup buffalo.

1455
01:03:38,190 --> 01:03:38,880
All right?
So they were,

1456
01:03:39,090 --> 01:03:42,120
they essentially follow these things 
into this valley.

1457
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:45,660
Eventually the Anasazi Anasazi Indians 
move in,

1458
01:03:46,020 --> 01:03:49,290
they start cultivating the land and 
planting crops and you get this like,

1459
01:03:50,370 --> 01:03:52,290
oh my Gosh,
agriculture and hunting,

1460
01:03:52,291 --> 01:03:54,000
which one is better?
What do we do?

1461
01:03:54,450 --> 01:03:56,580
And so the whole story of that 
interaction,

1462
01:03:57,050 --> 01:04:02,050
uh,
is interesting to me because it's kind 

1463
01:04:02,050 --> 01:04:02,050
of the evolution of our culture,
right?

1464
01:04:02,050 --> 01:04:04,890
Hunting is created this social structure
wise for us to communicate.

1465
01:04:04,891 --> 01:04:09,891
It's created all these things,
ways for our body to grow and expand as 

1466
01:04:09,891 --> 01:04:09,891
we were,
you know,

1467
01:04:09,891 --> 01:04:13,320
early humans,
a waste for our brain to expand and grow

1468
01:04:13,321 --> 01:04:14,460
and function differently.

1469
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:16,050
And then you have this like,
oh,

1470
01:04:16,110 --> 01:04:21,060
it's a lot easier to plant crops in the 
ground than it is to go kill a sheep.

1471
01:04:21,090 --> 01:04:22,230
Right.
Guys,

1472
01:04:22,650 --> 01:04:27,650
anybody is this easier,
so then you get into this weird thing 

1473
01:04:27,650 --> 01:04:27,650
like what do we do now?
You know,

1474
01:04:27,650 --> 01:04:32,570
and so I think their,
their story was very much like the 

1475
01:04:32,570 --> 01:04:37,460
Anasazi Indians,
they go in and they cultivate this area 

1476
01:04:37,460 --> 01:04:37,460
and as long as they can grow crops,
that's what they did,

1477
01:04:37,530 --> 01:04:41,320
you know?
And so this nomadic band of hunters kind

1478
01:04:41,321 --> 01:04:45,240
of settled in this area and so I'm sure 
they still wanted to get me because they

1479
01:04:45,241 --> 01:04:49,050
have to because you can't grow a whole 
year's worth of food for,

1480
01:04:49,410 --> 01:04:54,410
for a value like that.
But I think agriculture kind of won out 

1481
01:04:54,410 --> 01:04:56,100
a little bit in that,
in that scenario and as it would,

1482
01:04:56,101 --> 01:04:58,060
it's easier way to live.
Yeah,

1483
01:04:58,080 --> 01:04:59,210
it's an evolutionary.
What?

1484
01:04:59,340 --> 01:04:59,790
Easier way.

1485
01:05:00,060 --> 01:05:01,680
I mean the whole thing is filling your 
belly.

1486
01:05:01,890 --> 01:05:04,170
That's the whole thing.
And everything you know,

1487
01:05:04,171 --> 01:05:09,171
you can do to do it,
whether it's with deer or whether it's 

1488
01:05:09,171 --> 01:05:10,200
with corn or whether it's with tomatoes 
or whatever.

1489
01:05:10,201 --> 01:05:12,390
You can grow and you know,
you just have to eat.

1490
01:05:12,730 --> 01:05:14,100
I mean that's,
that's the whole,

1491
01:05:14,130 --> 01:05:16,380
the whole picture is staying alive back 
then.

1492
01:05:16,620 --> 01:05:21,620
That's not whole picture today,
so that's where it gets really 

1493
01:05:21,620 --> 01:05:23,770
complicated and that's where I think 
that hunters have done a really good job

1494
01:05:23,771 --> 01:05:28,270
over the last x amount of years 
describing to people like,

1495
01:05:28,870 --> 01:05:33,280
if you're going to eat meat,
this is the most ethical,

1496
01:05:33,370 --> 01:05:36,550
the most cruelty free and the most 
natural way to do it.

1497
01:05:36,730 --> 01:05:40,330
And you're talking about an animal that 
literally like,

1498
01:05:40,390 --> 01:05:41,560
okay,
here's a perfect example.

1499
01:05:41,561 --> 01:05:43,890
That deer mule deer that looking at 
right here,

1500
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:49,200
that deer had no idea I was alive until 
it died and it died instantly.

1501
01:05:49,540 --> 01:05:51,190
It was boom,
one shot,

1502
01:05:51,220 --> 01:05:54,310
it dropped right where I shot it,
and that's it.

1503
01:05:54,370 --> 01:05:56,620
And then it becomes steak,
you know,

1504
01:05:56,621 --> 01:05:58,450
and it becomes delicious food that we 
ate.

1505
01:05:58,451 --> 01:06:03,451
And that's uh,
that's way better than any other animal 

1506
01:06:03,451 --> 01:06:03,760
that you're ever going to buy in the 
store.

1507
01:06:03,761 --> 01:06:05,680
I don't care if you're talking about 
farm raised,

1508
01:06:05,681 --> 01:06:07,630
grass fed,
you know,

1509
01:06:07,631 --> 01:06:08,290
locally,

1510
01:06:09,140 --> 01:06:14,140
I feel like your evolution as a hunter 
has been accelerated more than most 

1511
01:06:14,140 --> 01:06:14,140
practices.
That's how you do everything.

1512
01:06:14,140 --> 01:06:16,450
But you went from,
when I first we first hunting in British

1513
01:06:16,451 --> 01:06:21,310
Columbia was three,
three years ago to where you are now.

1514
01:06:21,410 --> 01:06:26,410
You've evolved in this like what you see
as hunting and in our community and in 

1515
01:06:26,410 --> 01:06:27,970
our world and doing different things.
Um,

1516
01:06:28,060 --> 01:06:29,890
and in some ways you evolve from when I 
was a kid,

1517
01:06:29,891 --> 01:06:31,420
we just shot deer.
Oh,

1518
01:06:31,421 --> 01:06:33,810
here's the spike,
here's a four point shot this deer.

1519
01:06:33,880 --> 01:06:38,880
And that was a great day.
We drag it off and eat it and it's 

1520
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:38,880
great.
Now.

1521
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:41,920
I understand way more about what I was 
doing then and what I'm doing now.

1522
01:06:42,520 --> 01:06:47,520
And I think what at hunters we need to 
be cognizant of and comfortable with is 

1523
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:48,880
you changed your sensibilities.
Change over time.

1524
01:06:49,180 --> 01:06:51,850
You don't become a trophy hunter,
you're not a trophy hunter,

1525
01:06:51,851 --> 01:06:56,020
but you do appreciate the difference 
between a small antlered an animal and a

1526
01:06:56,021 --> 01:07:01,021
large one as it terms of its maturity 
and how awesome it is to see a 380 inch 

1527
01:07:01,871 --> 01:07:04,000
elk or 200 inch deer.
You know,

1528
01:07:04,040 --> 01:07:04,590
you,
you,

1529
01:07:04,660 --> 01:07:07,000
you're pursued is different than it was 
when we shot that Moose.

1530
01:07:07,230 --> 01:07:08,000
It is also.

1531
01:07:08,040 --> 01:07:13,040
But the also part of the pursuit is 
different is that I understand that the 

1532
01:07:13,040 --> 01:07:16,140
benefit of going after mature animals is
if you're getting a mature deer,

1533
01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:19,050
you're talking about a deer that's five 
years old,

1534
01:07:19,290 --> 01:07:23,940
that deer has had five breeding seasons,
has spread its genes,

1535
01:07:24,210 --> 01:07:29,210
and by killing it you're going to give a
chance to the younger bucks to that are 

1536
01:07:29,210 --> 01:07:30,930
coming up to breed.
So it's done.

1537
01:07:30,931 --> 01:07:32,190
It's part,
it's spread,

1538
01:07:32,191 --> 01:07:34,260
it's jeans,
it's created its progeny,

1539
01:07:34,261 --> 01:07:39,261
and now you'll take it out of a mix.
And this is the right way to do it 

1540
01:07:39,261 --> 01:07:41,240
because then you ensure a healthy herd 
that like,

1541
01:07:41,250 --> 01:07:44,250
especially for bear,
that's the big argument.

1542
01:07:44,251 --> 01:07:49,251
You want to take out the dominant males 
because the dominant males actually eat 

1543
01:07:49,251 --> 01:07:50,490
the cubs marauders,
animals.

1544
01:07:50,550 --> 01:07:54,360
That's the craziest part about it is by 
shooting a bore,

1545
01:07:54,510 --> 01:07:57,080
you're going to save the lives of many 
bear.

1546
01:07:57,081 --> 01:07:59,250
Yeah,
it's a week in many ways.

1547
01:07:59,251 --> 01:08:01,650
It's kind of a catch 22 because you're 
talking about controlling.

1548
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:04,370
Well isn't uh,
isn't a catch 22 that the,

1549
01:08:04,500 --> 01:08:06,410
uh,
younger deer tastes better.

1550
01:08:06,530 --> 01:08:11,530
Yeah.
And so like you're out there like I 

1551
01:08:11,530 --> 01:08:13,331
really love access to your meat,
but to it when we're over there they're 

1552
01:08:13,331 --> 01:08:16,810
like,
we have certain call box and there 

1553
01:08:16,810 --> 01:08:18,201
certain things you want to shoot.
It's like I really access to your and 

1554
01:08:18,201 --> 01:08:18,201
if,

1555
01:08:18,201 --> 01:08:18,470
if I was out there just for me,
I would have shot the youngest,

1556
01:08:18,980 --> 01:08:23,980
probably not the youngest,
but I would've picked a certain age 

1557
01:08:23,980 --> 01:08:25,661
group.
And here's the argument against that 

1558
01:08:25,661 --> 01:08:25,760
with axis deer,
that deer I shot was not young.

1559
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:29,690
That was a big ass dinner and that 
fucking things delicious dishes.

1560
01:08:29,820 --> 01:08:31,940
Like they're better than that when 
they're younger.

1561
01:08:31,941 --> 01:08:36,941
I don't need that.
It's a fact that a younger animal is 

1562
01:08:36,941 --> 01:08:39,641
more tender and is a better,
better cut of meat than an older animal 

1563
01:08:39,641 --> 01:08:39,641
for sure.
In most cases.

1564
01:08:39,860 --> 01:08:42,350
Not all cases,
but that's the general.

1565
01:08:42,500 --> 01:08:44,870
That giant elk that I shot where you saw
the antlers.

1566
01:08:44,871 --> 01:08:47,030
They're all delicious.
That's amazing.

1567
01:08:47,240 --> 01:08:49,190
I've been eating that thing for eight 
months now.

1568
01:08:49,250 --> 01:08:51,110
It's fantastic.
Yeah.

1569
01:08:51,111 --> 01:08:52,100
I do the same thing,
but I.

1570
01:08:52,101 --> 01:08:54,280
elk is great no matter what.
Yeah.

1571
01:08:55,090 --> 01:08:56,190
Animals.
Yeah.

1572
01:08:56,210 --> 01:08:57,920
You're talking about two animals that 
it's hard.

1573
01:08:57,920 --> 01:09:01,010
It'd be hard to mess it up,
but in general that's the,

1574
01:09:01,100 --> 01:09:03,020
that's the matter,
right?

1575
01:09:03,240 --> 01:09:06,290
Since there's that argument though,
you know why I don't like that argument.

1576
01:09:06,291 --> 01:09:10,220
I don't mind chewy meat and I like,
I like eating what I kill,

1577
01:09:10,410 --> 01:09:13,730
so like it feels good to me on top of it
tasting good.

1578
01:09:13,760 --> 01:09:16,940
Like if I eat a deer that's a six year 
old deer.

1579
01:09:17,150 --> 01:09:18,710
There's two things going on there.
One,

1580
01:09:18,711 --> 01:09:22,550
there's a satisfaction that I know the 
six year old is very difficult to hunt.

1581
01:09:22,551 --> 01:09:23,420
Yes.
You know,

1582
01:09:23,421 --> 01:09:26,270
so most of the places where you have 
other people are hunting as well.

1583
01:09:26,280 --> 01:09:29,540
A six year old deer has seen people that
are hunting deer period.

1584
01:09:29,541 --> 01:09:32,090
That's right.
So that deer is going to be on point.

1585
01:09:32,240 --> 01:09:35,090
That's a tough deer to kill.
So by killing that deer,

1586
01:09:35,091 --> 01:09:37,370
you get extra satisfaction.
That's one.

1587
01:09:37,580 --> 01:09:39,830
And then on to you,
you're,

1588
01:09:39,831 --> 01:09:40,430
you're,
you're,

1589
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:43,520
you're eating this animal that you have 
this connection with.

1590
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:46,160
So it tastes good because of that.
And I'd like.

1591
01:09:46,580 --> 01:09:51,170
I like meat that tastes like me.
I don't want like Philemon Yon,

1592
01:09:51,320 --> 01:09:52,130
you know,
I like,

1593
01:09:52,250 --> 01:09:54,020
I like a deer steak,
you know,

1594
01:09:54,021 --> 01:09:54,440
like,
uh,

1595
01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:58,100
the best a sirloin from a mule deer.
I'd prefer that.

1596
01:09:58,280 --> 01:10:03,280
Well,
I would say like if you took 

1597
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:03,280
conservation and organic meat,
right?

1598
01:10:03,530 --> 01:10:04,580
And you said,
I'm going for.

1599
01:10:04,670 --> 01:10:06,410
I understand both those principals.
I'm going hunting.

1600
01:10:06,530 --> 01:10:11,530
Everything's great.
You're shooting that six year old mule 

1601
01:10:11,530 --> 01:10:11,530
deer,
right?

1602
01:10:11,530 --> 01:10:11,530
If you,
if you remove conservation,

1603
01:10:11,530 --> 01:10:16,270
you're probably not going to shoot that 
six year old mule deer because you're 

1604
01:10:16,270 --> 01:10:16,270
going to get a younger deer that's 
easier to kill,

1605
01:10:16,370 --> 01:10:17,480
more tender,
more delicious.

1606
01:10:17,490 --> 01:10:19,940
Drink and shoot that.
Bartow Garcia,

1607
01:10:19,941 --> 01:10:21,530
the chef and the Montana.
Yeah.

1608
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:26,800
He,
he gets shit from other hunters because 

1609
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:26,800
he'll shoot a spike on purpose.
He's like,

1610
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:27,620
look,
I'm here for the meat.

1611
01:10:27,620 --> 01:10:28,520
Yeah.
As he goes,

1612
01:10:28,521 --> 01:10:32,570
I'm grocery shopping.
That should be in general.

1613
01:10:32,571 --> 01:10:35,510
That should be okay.
But there's principles that say like the

1614
01:10:35,630 --> 01:10:38,180
shooting them mature animal is more 
beneficial to the hurt.

1615
01:10:38,570 --> 01:10:43,150
So that's yet another complexity that we
should all just say like,

1616
01:10:43,160 --> 01:10:44,030
man,
this is here.

1617
01:10:44,740 --> 01:10:45,850
Just gotTa.
Continue to talk about it.

1618
01:10:45,851 --> 01:10:50,851
That's important.
I think the way you approach is very 

1619
01:10:50,851 --> 01:10:53,801
important because you're entirely honest
about the good and the bad and the bear 

1620
01:10:53,801 --> 01:10:53,830
thing.
You know,

1621
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:56,360
like it's like it's not the best meat.
It's good man.

1622
01:10:56,440 --> 01:10:58,400
It's good,
but it's not as good as elk.

1623
01:10:58,430 --> 01:10:59,750
Yeah.
I'm not going to stand up and be like,

1624
01:10:59,751 --> 01:11:04,751
Hey,
policies mean to bears the best thing 

1625
01:11:04,751 --> 01:11:04,751
ever.
It's not.

1626
01:11:04,751 --> 01:11:08,230
Some people love it though.
I don't know if they're telling the 

1627
01:11:08,230 --> 01:11:08,230
truth.
They're telling the truth,

1628
01:11:08,230 --> 01:11:08,540
but it's just.
I'm just.

1629
01:11:08,541 --> 01:11:12,540
I would assure them if they would dabble
other mates,

1630
01:11:12,710 --> 01:11:14,490
they'll find that's better.
I'm pretty sure.

1631
01:11:14,670 --> 01:11:16,950
Well,
I guess it depends entirely upon the way

1632
01:11:16,951 --> 01:11:20,550
they prepare it,
but the thing about this,

1633
01:11:20,580 --> 01:11:25,580
an argument for hunting bears is 
different than the argument for hunting 

1634
01:11:25,580 --> 01:11:28,191
any other animal because you do eat them
and you need to kill them because they 

1635
01:11:28,191 --> 01:11:30,120
don't have a natural predator.
The problem with bears is like,

1636
01:11:30,121 --> 01:11:34,380
especially if we went in Alberta,
Jesus Christ to the art everywhere,

1637
01:11:34,440 --> 01:11:37,920
people to think there's a shortage of 
bears need to go to Alberta.

1638
01:11:38,390 --> 01:11:43,390
The people that want to have one of 
those experiences where you walk away 

1639
01:11:43,390 --> 01:11:44,150
from that and be like,
did I just do that?

1640
01:11:44,490 --> 01:11:49,490
Yeah.
They're 20 fucking bears hanging out 

1641
01:11:49,490 --> 01:11:50,580
over there with cam like I wish we get.
Can Call Cam Cam please text in.

1642
01:11:50,970 --> 01:11:52,500
He's at work right now.
Quit your job.

1643
01:11:52,680 --> 01:11:54,450
Quit your job cam and telling you for 
years.

1644
01:11:54,451 --> 01:11:57,180
Quit your job.
You're too cool to have a nine to five.

1645
01:11:57,360 --> 01:11:58,950
Uh,
it's,

1646
01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:00,560
he's got a 75.
Oh,

1647
01:12:00,610 --> 01:12:05,610
the Lord takes two hours.
Launched to go workout and run the 

1648
01:12:05,610 --> 01:12:05,610
mountains.

1649
01:12:05,610 --> 01:12:05,960
Well,
that's savagery.

1650
01:12:06,110 --> 01:12:07,280
This savagery.
He does

1651
01:12:07,460 --> 01:12:09,110
good.
Seven to five Scott.

1652
01:12:09,170 --> 01:12:11,200
Damn savage do.
I'm not going to get my ass together and

1653
01:12:11,201 --> 01:12:16,201
he's a legit savage.
I know every time I'm complaining about 

1654
01:12:16,201 --> 01:12:16,310
anything to think about campaigns 
getting up at 4:00

1655
01:12:16,311 --> 01:12:19,340
in the morning to run with show,
think about that like 190,

1656
01:12:19,341 --> 01:12:22,850
eighth mile,
205th.

1657
01:12:23,650 --> 01:12:25,400
He's going to do 2:30
for the summer.

1658
01:12:25,590 --> 01:12:30,590
It only gets worse.
My Dad was an ultra marathon runner 

1659
01:12:30,590 --> 01:12:30,590
growing up and it just gets worse.
It's like smoking crack.

1660
01:12:30,590 --> 01:12:31,990
Oh,
they just get deeper into your grandma's

1661
01:12:32,340 --> 01:12:33,280
door.
I,

1662
01:12:33,350 --> 01:12:38,350
that's probably a terrible analogy,
but I'm scared of it because I keep 

1663
01:12:38,350 --> 01:12:39,230
running further and further distances.
I'm like,

1664
01:12:39,231 --> 01:12:41,630
what am I doing?
And I'm doing it more and more often.

1665
01:12:41,720 --> 01:12:42,780
What am I doing?
You're,

1666
01:12:42,980 --> 01:12:44,900
you're feeling a runner's high.
Well,

1667
01:12:44,901 --> 01:12:49,901
it's a little bit of that,
but it's also like I feel improvement 

1668
01:12:49,901 --> 01:12:49,901
and I'm a improvement junk.
Yeah,

1669
01:12:49,901 --> 01:12:53,990
I know that I can keep pushing further.
I'm going further distances.

1670
01:12:53,991 --> 01:12:55,970
I feel better when I hit the top of the 
hill.

1671
01:12:56,210 --> 01:12:56,570
Yeah.

1672
01:12:56,720 --> 01:12:57,520
Well my dad like,
well,

1673
01:12:57,521 --> 01:13:00,650
when I was a kid I remember my dad just 
being a regular,

1674
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:05,480
he must have been mid forties,
maybe late forties and he mowed,

1675
01:13:05,481 --> 01:13:09,410
we had like a fairly small backyard and 
he mowed a little circle and he would go

1676
01:13:09,411 --> 01:13:14,411
out after work in his jeans and his 
loafers and like jog around the circle 

1677
01:13:14,411 --> 01:13:16,070
and it was very like.
I remember looking out there being like,

1678
01:13:16,700 --> 01:13:18,260
what are you doing man?
How big was he hard?

1679
01:13:18,530 --> 01:13:20,370
It was like maybe an acre,
I don't know.

1680
01:13:20,380 --> 01:13:24,110
It would very big and he was running 
like just little circles in this yard.

1681
01:13:24,570 --> 01:13:26,540
Let me get to the end of the story.
You'll,

1682
01:13:26,610 --> 01:13:28,520
you'll get it eventually.
But that was,

1683
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:30,770
that was his way to run.
Right.

1684
01:13:31,610 --> 01:13:35,330
And so after a while he started running,
you know,

1685
01:13:35,331 --> 01:13:40,331
got running shoes and started to get 
into the actual sport of running and 

1686
01:13:40,331 --> 01:13:42,980
then it seems to me like three or four 
years later he was like,

1687
01:13:42,981 --> 01:13:46,100
I think I'm going to run this 50 mile 
race in the mountains of Maryland,

1688
01:13:46,220 --> 01:13:47,270
JFK,
50 miler.

1689
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:50,120
And had he run marathons?
No,

1690
01:13:51,770 --> 01:13:54,930
no.
So 50 mile races.

1691
01:13:54,931 --> 01:13:56,850
Like what?
It was like six hours,

1692
01:13:56,851 --> 01:13:57,840
seven hours a year.

1693
01:13:58,430 --> 01:14:00,060
Eight or nine hours.
I think.

1694
01:14:00,210 --> 01:14:02,910
Eight or nine.
I think when you started or maybe 10.

1695
01:14:03,400 --> 01:14:04,350
I think 12.
The

1696
01:14:04,380 --> 01:14:05,600
cuddle.
Interesting.

1697
01:14:05,601 --> 01:14:08,030
Like eight hours for 50 per for a 
hundred.

1698
01:14:08,031 --> 01:14:09,650
It's 24.
Of course it is.

1699
01:14:09,651 --> 01:14:12,460
It's like listen bitch,
75.

1700
01:14:14,950 --> 01:14:19,950
But my dad used to run.
He used to run and places it was like 

1701
01:14:19,950 --> 01:14:21,550
the JFK,
$50 up over this mountain.

1702
01:14:21,551 --> 01:14:26,551
It's not like I remember you telling me 
stories of people falling and like 

1703
01:14:26,551 --> 01:14:30,210
busting themselves all up on these rocky
cliff trails and he would come in and 

1704
01:14:30,480 --> 01:14:32,050
this is gonna make my dad sound weird.
He's not,

1705
01:14:32,051 --> 01:14:32,980
he's,
he's awesome.

1706
01:14:33,340 --> 01:14:38,340
But he would save his toenails.
All his toenails would fall off during 

1707
01:14:38,340 --> 01:14:39,220
the race and he like save them,
putting them in a little jar.

1708
01:14:40,030 --> 01:14:42,100
Memories he save his boogers to.
No,

1709
01:14:42,101 --> 01:14:42,970
no,
just toenails.

1710
01:14:43,390 --> 01:14:44,930
Uh,
and it was almost like this,

1711
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:48,760
like I can take that lack this thing.
And then he went,

1712
01:14:48,761 --> 01:14:53,761
ran 50 and then I think one time we ran 
a hundred and then he ran the entire c 

1713
01:14:53,761 --> 01:14:55,060
and o canal one time,
183 miles.

1714
01:14:55,480 --> 01:14:57,610
And I was like,
I think it was in maybe a senior in high

1715
01:14:57,611 --> 01:15:02,611
school and I had had to drive to the 
checkpoints and like give him food and 

1716
01:15:02,611 --> 01:15:02,611
stuff.

1717
01:15:02,611 --> 01:15:04,870
He never started until he was in his 
forties guy,

1718
01:15:04,871 --> 01:15:06,640
maybe fifties,
forties,

1719
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:08,970
probably I would say.
Yeah,

1720
01:15:09,190 --> 01:15:10,240
like sorties.
Did He,

1721
01:15:10,420 --> 01:15:11,890
does he still do it?
How old is he now?

1722
01:15:12,010 --> 01:15:13,780
He would still do it if his knees would 
allow him to.

1723
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:15,950
He's mid sixties.
60 five is nice.

1724
01:15:15,951 --> 01:15:17,110
You're fucked up.
But he's still.

1725
01:15:17,111 --> 01:15:18,850
He's.
He'll still bike and he'll still.

1726
01:15:18,851 --> 01:15:23,851
He hikes all the time now so we still 
has that like need to push push and he 

1727
01:15:25,290 --> 01:15:30,290
like when he gets around,
one of his buddies in particular that 

1728
01:15:30,290 --> 01:15:32,820
they ran together,
they're like old army buddies and 

1729
01:15:32,820 --> 01:15:35,701
talking about this experience that they 
shared together like remember that one 

1730
01:15:35,701 --> 01:15:39,721
time a mile,
mile 94 when you tripped and fell and 

1731
01:15:39,721 --> 01:15:40,510
it's just like they're telling old war 
stories.

1732
01:15:40,630 --> 01:15:43,270
It's like this visceral thing that they 
share.

1733
01:15:43,630 --> 01:15:47,170
It's really cool.
He did it passed.

1734
01:15:47,171 --> 01:15:48,550
I mean maybe it's a midlife crisis man.

1735
01:15:48,550 --> 01:15:50,380
I don't know,
but yeah,

1736
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:54,970
he wasn't predisposed to run 100 miles 
until he decided that he wanted to.

1737
01:15:56,140 --> 01:15:57,970
Yeah.
It's weird,

1738
01:15:57,971 --> 01:15:58,530
right?
That,

1739
01:15:58,531 --> 01:16:03,531
that,
that compulsion is a very odd one that 

1740
01:16:03,531 --> 01:16:04,810
the need for suffering.
Like Cam's got it bad,

1741
01:16:05,050 --> 01:16:06,700
it becomes a thing.
Yeah.

1742
01:16:06,730 --> 01:16:08,680
He's got a bat in a weird way.
Or my dad,

1743
01:16:08,681 --> 01:16:10,680
like he got a knee surgery and then 
like,

1744
01:16:10,720 --> 01:16:12,790
well they said it was a acl.
I think it was.

1745
01:16:13,240 --> 01:16:16,110
Or it was the scope of his knee.
He had an eastern scope scope.

1746
01:16:16,111 --> 01:16:18,730
It's an easy one.
But what if they cut his knee open?

1747
01:16:18,940 --> 01:16:20,710
Can't remember what.
I don't want to say the wrong one,

1748
01:16:20,711 --> 01:16:22,000
but he had knee surgery and they're 
like,

1749
01:16:22,001 --> 01:16:24,400
give it four or five days before you're 
up and moving around.

1750
01:16:24,401 --> 01:16:27,220
And he was like joking around the 
backyard on day two,

1751
01:16:27,610 --> 01:16:29,740
limping around.
Just you could just tell he was in pain.

1752
01:16:29,860 --> 01:16:30,970
Oh,
that must have been meniscus.

1753
01:16:31,050 --> 01:16:32,230
Yeah.
Something like that.

1754
01:16:32,231 --> 01:16:34,390
Some tendon of some sort,
but it was just like,

1755
01:16:34,391 --> 01:16:36,120
you could just see this.
This dude is.

1756
01:16:36,150 --> 01:16:38,020
This is.
If you can't do this man,

1757
01:16:38,050 --> 01:16:41,290
it's not good for his psyche.
If he can do it,

1758
01:16:41,291 --> 01:16:42,930
he's a happy guy.
Well,

1759
01:16:42,940 --> 01:16:47,940
there's something that happens to you 
when you push yourself like that where 

1760
01:16:47,940 --> 01:16:49,390
it makes regular life easier and that's 
part of the addiction.

1761
01:16:49,470 --> 01:16:51,160
It's real.
When I went to Nepal,

1762
01:16:51,161 --> 01:16:52,870
man,
that's exactly why I came back.

1763
01:16:52,871 --> 01:16:57,871
I was like,
I brought back a sheep I killed and all 

1764
01:16:57,871 --> 01:17:00,160
that stuff,
but perspective as what you were telling

1765
01:17:00,161 --> 01:17:03,910
me how you were hallucinating,
baby.

1766
01:17:03,970 --> 01:17:05,830
I did.
Tell me about that.

1767
01:17:06,170 --> 01:17:08,170
Right?
How high were you?

1768
01:17:08,260 --> 01:17:08,980
We got,
we'll have to.

1769
01:17:09,380 --> 01:17:10,190
We were there.

1770
01:17:10,190 --> 01:17:12,770
We were like 13,000,
maybe 13 years.

1771
01:17:12,771 --> 01:17:14,450
13.
Five at 13,000

1772
01:17:14,451 --> 01:17:17,720
feet above sea level and so it's sketchy
as fuck.

1773
01:17:17,721 --> 01:17:19,310
It's sketchy.
It's not something to mess around with.

1774
01:17:19,311 --> 01:17:23,690
I found that especially on this trip,
so we were hunting blue sheep in Nepal,

1775
01:17:24,140 --> 01:17:25,340
Belushi,
Belushi.

1776
01:17:25,370 --> 01:17:26,360
What does that look?
Look it up.

1777
01:17:27,200 --> 01:17:29,000
Kind of like an all dad.
It's got these little.

1778
01:17:29,030 --> 01:17:30,620
Wow.
It's got really,

1779
01:17:31,820 --> 01:17:34,100
really.
You can really see their annual.

1780
01:17:34,101 --> 01:17:36,550
I like the.
The age rings and their horns.

1781
01:17:36,590 --> 01:17:39,320
They go straight out the short and 
stocky.

1782
01:17:39,380 --> 01:17:44,380
It'd be cool to look at them.
They were cool animal and it's one of 

1783
01:17:44,380 --> 01:17:44,510
those things where we went to hunt him 
and I didn't really have much of an idea

1784
01:17:44,511 --> 01:17:48,080
of what blue sheep was until until we 
started getting into the thing.

1785
01:17:48,110 --> 01:17:49,330
There's one.
Oh Wow.

1786
01:17:49,410 --> 01:17:50,630
Morales.
What they call me over there.

1787
01:17:50,660 --> 01:17:52,250
Wow.
What a cooler can animal.

1788
01:17:52,270 --> 01:17:53,660
Yeah.
Yeah.

1789
01:17:53,661 --> 01:17:56,930
Mine wasn't quite that big and that one 
looks like it might be at a farm,

1790
01:17:57,680 --> 01:18:02,680
but uh,
because it's mowed grass and then maybe 

1791
01:18:02,680 --> 01:18:02,930
we don't to go mow the grass.
That looks like more.

1792
01:18:03,490 --> 01:18:08,490
I saw a very disturbing video of a goat 
eating a whole bucket of chicks.

1793
01:18:10,360 --> 01:18:13,070
I'm a little baby.
A baby chickens?

1794
01:18:14,120 --> 01:18:15,740
Yeah.
It was on.

1795
01:18:15,741 --> 01:18:17,720
What were you watching?
It was on an instagram page.

1796
01:18:17,721 --> 01:18:22,250
I think it was either was a Jimmy Jew or
clown in the homie.

1797
01:18:22,251 --> 01:18:23,450
Yeah,
that's it right there.

1798
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:27,320
Look this fucking goat.
So I was just sitting there eating.

1799
01:18:27,770 --> 01:18:30,470
This is on a youtube.
And what's the name of the video?

1800
01:18:30,471 --> 01:18:33,530
Jamie.
They're amazing.

1801
01:18:33,560 --> 01:18:37,610
Goat eating live alive baby chicken.
So there's these two.

1802
01:18:37,950 --> 01:18:42,950
There's several bins of baby chicks and 
this Ngo is just standing there and it 

1803
01:18:43,221 --> 01:18:48,221
just reaches in,
choose one down and the goats aren't 

1804
01:18:48,221 --> 01:18:50,200
carnivores so they don't have the teeth 
for this and this thing.

1805
01:18:50,210 --> 01:18:52,220
This baby chicks trying to fucking 
clawed its way out.

1806
01:18:52,221 --> 01:18:54,810
It's we'll get as much as he reaches in.
Oh,

1807
01:18:54,811 --> 01:18:55,940
he's just like,
I'll get one.

1808
01:18:55,970 --> 01:18:56,810
Oh,
I can't catch it.

1809
01:18:56,860 --> 01:18:58,490
We lost that one.
That one lived.

1810
01:18:58,840 --> 01:18:59,690
Look,
he gets one.

1811
01:18:59,720 --> 01:19:00,670
Here we go.
I got your bed.

1812
01:19:00,680 --> 01:19:04,880
She's just started doing.
Just started chewing like what?

1813
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:08,210
What is happening with this one?
Wild Impala.

1814
01:19:08,270 --> 01:19:13,270
Fights back is its guts.
Fall out and feel like you're really 

1815
01:19:13,270 --> 01:19:13,340
making the case for Christ.
Predator hunter.

1816
01:19:13,370 --> 01:19:14,070
Yeah.
Look at this.

1817
01:19:14,220 --> 01:19:17,720
This will know Paula is getting chewed 
apart by this wild dog.

1818
01:19:17,750 --> 01:19:19,340
Oh my God.
Do it.

1819
01:19:19,790 --> 01:19:21,800
Don't stop it.
Oh my God.

1820
01:19:21,801 --> 01:19:23,690
But it's just.
It's in the cavity.

1821
01:19:24,890 --> 01:19:28,070
Oh Jesus Christ.
That's like where the Bacon is.

1822
01:19:28,870 --> 01:19:31,970
Oh God.

1823
01:19:34,180 --> 01:19:38,060
Oh Africa.
You're a dirty mother.

1824
01:19:38,090 --> 01:19:38,750
Look at this.
This,

1825
01:19:38,760 --> 01:19:39,900
and Paul was like,
come on,

1826
01:19:40,890 --> 01:19:42,950
let me.
I'm stabbing you motherfucker.

1827
01:19:42,951 --> 01:19:44,000
I know I got weapons.
I'm like,

1828
01:19:44,020 --> 01:19:46,190
look at your tail.
Oh,

1829
01:19:46,280 --> 01:19:51,280
look at this show down.
This is guts are literally hanging out 

1830
01:19:51,501 --> 01:19:56,000
to the ground and it's standing up.
How tough are these things,

1831
01:19:56,001 --> 01:19:57,500
man and I.
I mean,

1832
01:19:57,510 --> 01:19:59,570
I would not want to get gored by that 
impala.

1833
01:19:59,630 --> 01:20:00,710
Oh,
horn.

1834
01:20:00,980 --> 01:20:02,780
The dog doesn't neither.
Are they on a road?

1835
01:20:02,840 --> 01:20:03,710
Yeah,
they sure are.

1836
01:20:04,070 --> 01:20:05,400
There's a road right there.
Paved road.

1837
01:20:05,401 --> 01:20:08,790
We kind of just circles him to.
We can attach them on the flank.

1838
01:20:08,850 --> 01:20:10,860
Isn't it just messed up like wolves and 
coyotes?

1839
01:20:10,861 --> 01:20:14,190
They hit the back legs first.
That caused that shock and blood loss.

1840
01:20:14,310 --> 01:20:17,450
I'm a big fan of cats because least cats
will grab you by your neck.

1841
01:20:18,840 --> 01:20:20,610
This motherfucker is not doing that.

1842
01:20:22,670 --> 01:20:25,500
This is weird.
There's a whole minute 30 left of this.

1843
01:20:26,520 --> 01:20:27,060
Yeah.
Oh,

1844
01:20:27,061 --> 01:20:29,700
there's more.
More come in and he's like,

1845
01:20:29,740 --> 01:20:31,240
that's it.
That's a wrap on.

1846
01:20:31,260 --> 01:20:34,260
They just grabbed the guts like how much
more has fallen out now?

1847
01:20:34,320 --> 01:20:35,730
Oh,
how can it be alive?

1848
01:20:36,390 --> 01:20:38,160
I have no idea.
I don't understand.

1849
01:20:38,220 --> 01:20:40,260
And they just go in after the leg.
Here comes another one.

1850
01:20:41,630 --> 01:20:43,070
Yeah.
Oh No.

1851
01:20:43,090 --> 01:20:44,670
It doesn't know what to do,
man.

1852
01:20:45,090 --> 01:20:50,090
Oh God.
We're having some Vegan.

1853
01:20:51,120 --> 01:20:52,420
Oh,
dinner too.

1854
01:20:52,421 --> 01:20:53,970
Just like what?
Six of them.

1855
01:20:54,050 --> 01:20:55,350
Three,
seven,

1856
01:20:57,180 --> 01:20:58,710
seven.
It's dead.

1857
01:20:59,220 --> 01:21:00,210
It's dead.
Now.

1858
01:21:00,330 --> 01:21:01,390
Look at that chunk.
Oh,

1859
01:21:01,400 --> 01:21:04,530
they just pulled the guts out and one 
watching.

1860
01:21:04,940 --> 01:21:06,780
Look how fast they tear that fucking 
thing.

1861
01:21:07,760 --> 01:21:10,110
Look at that.
It's just body cavity.

1862
01:21:10,111 --> 01:21:12,570
Now.
Holy Shit.

1863
01:21:12,571 --> 01:21:15,390
Did they drag the head off man there no 
jokes.

1864
01:21:15,950 --> 01:21:18,240
And those guys are nothing compared to 
hyenas.

1865
01:21:19,050 --> 01:21:20,100
Yeah,
it's hard out.

1866
01:21:20,100 --> 01:21:22,260
There is the point.
Like if you get hit by an Arrow,

1867
01:21:22,261 --> 01:21:25,380
it's way better than that.
Folks was like three minutes of terror.

1868
01:21:25,410 --> 01:21:30,410
Yeah.
We're going for the vitals were going 

1869
01:21:30,410 --> 01:21:30,410
for double lungs or a heart.
It's going to end nicely.

1870
01:21:30,410 --> 01:21:31,950
Is the biggest part with the Internet.
You get from like,

1871
01:21:31,951 --> 01:21:36,910
what's a blue sheep to that shit too?
Yeah.

1872
01:21:36,920 --> 01:21:38,970
Will you?
You can go way deeper than that,

1873
01:21:39,020 --> 01:21:39,990
you know?
Yeah.

1874
01:21:39,991 --> 01:21:41,790
I saw it.
Got Chopped his dick off the other day.

1875
01:21:42,600 --> 01:21:43,450
What I would.
Yeah,

1876
01:21:43,500 --> 01:21:45,630
I,
I just for a Goof,

1877
01:21:45,750 --> 01:21:48,480
I um,
was looking at different hashtags online

1878
01:21:48,690 --> 01:21:53,690
and I look for Hashtag triggered.
I think I might've wrote Hashtag 

1879
01:21:53,690 --> 01:21:55,800
triggered in something.
So I look for Hashtag triggered thinking

1880
01:21:55,801 --> 01:21:58,200
I could find a post that I wrote.
Oh good luck.

1881
01:21:58,560 --> 01:22:00,710
There's millions.
You're always.

1882
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:05,960
One of them was this one dude chopping 
his own dick off and they somehow or 

1883
01:22:05,960 --> 01:22:07,890
another got on instagram and I was like,
how did that.

1884
01:22:08,850 --> 01:22:13,850
Nobody,
nobody caught it before they pulled it 

1885
01:22:13,850 --> 01:22:13,850
down.
Look,

1886
01:22:13,850 --> 01:22:14,160
there's no way they can take down 
everything.

1887
01:22:14,161 --> 01:22:17,280
Fucked up.
There's hashtagging it though.

1888
01:22:17,281 --> 01:22:20,370
That's savage thing.
The guys were like,

1889
01:22:20,600 --> 01:22:21,300
they were like,
well,

1890
01:22:22,680 --> 01:22:27,680
we're getting ready to get this done.
What do we do for the Hashtag 

1891
01:22:27,680 --> 01:22:27,680
[inaudible] that's.
We got to market it.

1892
01:22:27,680 --> 01:22:28,440
Like we got to have people triggered.
Trick.

1893
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:29,700
Hashtag triggered.
Yeah.

1894
01:22:29,701 --> 01:22:31,380
They have to market it.
Isn't that funny?

1895
01:22:31,620 --> 01:22:34,140
Marketing marketing is a big thing,
right?

1896
01:22:34,170 --> 01:22:35,970
You know what I was reading some 
mutilation,

1897
01:22:35,971 --> 01:22:39,680
some fucking youtube,
not even youtube.

1898
01:22:39,681 --> 01:22:44,681
Rather.
Some instagram person was talking about 

1899
01:22:44,681 --> 01:22:47,790
um,
what they do to market their brand and 

1900
01:22:47,790 --> 01:22:47,790
all.
They were like,

1901
01:22:47,790 --> 01:22:49,200
I like a fitness person.
And I was like,

1902
01:22:49,230 --> 01:22:51,660
get the fuck Outta here man.
You have a brand,

1903
01:22:51,930 --> 01:22:53,880
you have 10,000
followers.

1904
01:22:53,881 --> 01:22:58,670
Are you a brand or you just some dude 
who does squats Tuesdays,

1905
01:22:58,710 --> 01:23:00,420
arms and back.
That's my brand,

1906
01:23:00,450 --> 01:23:02,280
my brand,
my brand marketing team,

1907
01:23:02,310 --> 01:23:05,740
working hard on my brand.
It's like those,

1908
01:23:05,770 --> 01:23:06,190
those,

1909
01:23:06,580 --> 01:23:10,480
those kind of phrases,
people use those a lot and they won't do

1910
01:23:10,481 --> 01:23:13,570
something because it's off brand.
That's even a lead.

1911
01:23:13,571 --> 01:23:18,571
That's an extra level of Douchey brand.
Like I won't put that up because it's 

1912
01:23:19,271 --> 01:23:22,270
off brand for me.
Who was like my brand,

1913
01:23:22,271 --> 01:23:22,930
right,
exactly.

1914
01:23:23,310 --> 01:23:27,520
That'll fuck with putting out there.
Seems quite preposterous.

1915
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:30,860
Social media.
So tell me about seeing the baby and the

1916
01:23:30,861 --> 01:23:31,750
polio.
Let me finish.

1917
01:23:31,790 --> 01:23:34,400
So you're looking for.
Yeah,

1918
01:23:34,570 --> 01:23:38,440
so we're looking for the blue sheet.
So I'll start off by saying that we were

1919
01:23:38,441 --> 01:23:41,920
hunting in a very rural,
when I say rural,

1920
01:23:41,921 --> 01:23:46,921
it's like six days walk from the nearest
road where we were at the days and I 

1921
01:23:47,141 --> 01:23:50,080
said how many days walk to the paved 
road and they were like we don't,

1922
01:23:50,280 --> 01:23:53,230
I don't know what you're talking about.
Like we don't know we could engage that.

1923
01:23:54,070 --> 01:23:56,630
And so we're in this remote region in 
Nepal,

1924
01:23:56,830 --> 01:23:59,440
the in this district called the 
[inaudible] district.

1925
01:23:59,740 --> 01:24:03,340
And to say that the road from district 
is full of this,

1926
01:24:03,341 --> 01:24:08,341
like primal primal people and animals 
and it is really just out their place.

1927
01:24:09,400 --> 01:24:10,880
I think,
you know,

1928
01:24:10,900 --> 01:24:15,900
to be out away from civilization.
That was the furthest I think you could 

1929
01:24:15,900 --> 01:24:16,270
feel.
I mean,

1930
01:24:16,330 --> 01:24:21,330
we were out there and the people,
the people there were part of a civil 

1931
01:24:23,201 --> 01:24:26,800
war,
the Nepali civil war from 1996 to 2006.

1932
01:24:27,040 --> 01:24:30,940
This district was maybe the epicenter of
the rebellion.

1933
01:24:30,970 --> 01:24:33,460
There was a Communist Party rebelling 
against the government.

1934
01:24:33,540 --> 01:24:38,350
We can step monarchy and so the people 
there are,

1935
01:24:38,410 --> 01:24:43,410
are amazing because they've lived in 
this abject poverty for their entire 

1936
01:24:43,481 --> 01:24:48,481
lives and not only that,
they've lived through this civil war in 

1937
01:24:49,511 --> 01:24:51,490
recent times.
I think we think about civil wars,

1938
01:24:51,530 --> 01:24:55,170
this thing we go to see a national park.
Um,

1939
01:24:55,420 --> 01:24:57,330
so anyway,
we're,

1940
01:24:57,400 --> 01:25:00,640
we're with these people were hunting.
We go into,

1941
01:25:00,641 --> 01:25:02,260
we get helicoptered into 10,000
feet,

1942
01:25:02,560 --> 01:25:04,570
which is this knob in the middle of 
nowhere.

1943
01:25:05,290 --> 01:25:08,380
We hike about a full day to our base 
camp,

1944
01:25:08,410 --> 01:25:11,260
which is a little village called dual 
arc in the middle,

1945
01:25:11,261 --> 01:25:16,261
of course nowhere.
It's like this terrorist village and we 

1946
01:25:16,261 --> 01:25:18,190
meet our Sherpas and,
and made a bunch of locals.

1947
01:25:19,300 --> 01:25:21,790
And from there we go up.
We're going to do,

1948
01:25:21,791 --> 01:25:25,360
I think we had two or three more days of
hiking just to get to the area where the

1949
01:25:25,361 --> 01:25:28,060
blue sheep live,
so you're hiking from about 10,000

1950
01:25:28,061 --> 01:25:33,061
feet and I at our highest,
we're at probably 16 or 16 and some 

1951
01:25:33,061 --> 01:25:36,310
change and so the first day we go up and
we acclimate.

1952
01:25:36,790 --> 01:25:41,790
We site in,
our rifles were hanging out and we go 

1953
01:25:41,790 --> 01:25:45,220
into this lady's little mud,
dirt hut.

1954
01:25:45,550 --> 01:25:48,280
Essentially.
It's just like probably half the size of

1955
01:25:48,281 --> 01:25:53,281
this room with a little with a goat 
standing in the corner and a little fire

1956
01:25:54,431 --> 01:25:57,250
pit sitting around this fire pit and 
they start.

1957
01:25:57,340 --> 01:26:02,340
She starts telling this story about how 
right where we were sitting during the 

1958
01:26:02,340 --> 01:26:02,340
rebellion,
the police,

1959
01:26:02,340 --> 01:26:07,261
the government police came in and shot 
six men right where we were sitting and 

1960
01:26:07,261 --> 01:26:11,090
buried him out back and this is like,
this lady must be in her mid fifties and

1961
01:26:11,091 --> 01:26:13,040
she.
She looked like she was 80.

1962
01:26:13,440 --> 01:26:15,030
I mean,
she's just like this.

1963
01:26:15,540 --> 01:26:20,540
It was this transformative thing for me 
sitting there listening to this being 

1964
01:26:20,540 --> 01:26:21,740
translated like,
holy crap,

1965
01:26:21,770 --> 01:26:24,260
where are we?
And in the midst of that store,

1966
01:26:24,261 --> 01:26:26,510
they're passing around.
They had made this moonshine,

1967
01:26:26,511 --> 01:26:31,511
which they called Roxy.
It's just like made in a ceramic thing 

1968
01:26:31,910 --> 01:26:36,910
outside of where we were at.
And so we were all just drinking and I 

1969
01:26:36,910 --> 01:26:39,311
wasn't thinking much about drinking it.
And then we had one more day before we 

1970
01:26:39,311 --> 01:26:40,760
left.
The next day everybody was sick,

1971
01:26:40,761 --> 01:26:42,350
but me,
I'm talking shit,

1972
01:26:42,351 --> 01:26:44,330
your pants puke out the tent.

1973
01:26:44,600 --> 01:26:47,300
We had two or three people,
shit their pants the next day.

1974
01:26:47,460 --> 01:26:50,000
Like it was the,
the Katmandu flu.

1975
01:26:50,001 --> 01:26:55,001
Like everybody,
everybody that wasn't native to that 

1976
01:26:55,001 --> 01:26:55,460
area got sick.
I didn't on the first day.

1977
01:26:56,540 --> 01:27:01,540
So everybody recovers.
The next day we're going up the 

1978
01:27:01,540 --> 01:27:01,540
mountain,
we're going up.

1979
01:27:01,540 --> 01:27:05,950
We'd probably climbed about 2000 feet.
We go over this pass and I'm feeling 

1980
01:27:05,961 --> 01:27:10,961
good.
I feel like everybody else was probably 

1981
01:27:10,961 --> 01:27:12,761
feeling pretty crappy.
Then we're going down this ravine and 

1982
01:27:12,761 --> 01:27:17,581
this river valley to go.
We're on these like two or three foot 

1983
01:27:17,581 --> 01:27:19,670
wide goat trails probably.
It's like if you go to the right,

1984
01:27:19,671 --> 01:27:21,290
you're dead.
If you stepped two feet to the right,

1985
01:27:21,291 --> 01:27:22,160
you're going to die.
You're dead.

1986
01:27:22,161 --> 01:27:24,980
You fall off and you're dead.
We've got 24 Sherpas,

1987
01:27:25,210 --> 01:27:30,210
porters,
we've got three or four mules with all 

1988
01:27:30,210 --> 01:27:32,090
our camp gear going up this mountain and
a string of people,

1989
01:27:32,091 --> 01:27:33,170
probably 30 people long.

1990
01:27:33,890 --> 01:27:38,890
I'm in generally in the middle and we 
stop at some point after we had crested 

1991
01:27:38,890 --> 01:27:42,770
this high point and we're going down and
I remember feeling pretty good.

1992
01:27:42,771 --> 01:27:44,210
I got my trekking Poles,
I'm going,

1993
01:27:44,240 --> 01:27:49,240
it's warm outside and I'm going.
I'm like enjoying the view and looking 

1994
01:27:49,240 --> 01:27:49,790
around just thinking,
oh my God.

1995
01:27:50,480 --> 01:27:55,480
And then I.
Then I remember pretty quickly being 

1996
01:27:55,480 --> 01:27:55,480
laying in the snow like,
Oh,

1997
01:27:55,480 --> 01:27:57,020
I'm laying in the snow.
That's cool.

1998
01:27:57,410 --> 01:27:59,780
Like I had no recollection of how I got 
there.

1999
01:27:59,781 --> 01:28:04,781
What was happening at like.
So you're hiking and then when you wake 

2000
01:28:04,781 --> 01:28:06,470
up I was laying.
I don't know that I lost consciousness,

2001
01:28:06,471 --> 01:28:11,471
but I just didn't.
I don't think in my mind I understood 

2002
01:28:11,471 --> 01:28:13,931
what was going on.
Like I kinda stumbled back against this 

2003
01:28:13,931 --> 01:28:14,210
rock wall and then just slumped down in 
the snow.

2004
01:28:14,900 --> 01:28:19,280
I don't think anybody saw it.
And so I kind of stood up and I'm like,

2005
01:28:19,910 --> 01:28:21,170
you're okay.
You're good,

2006
01:28:22,220 --> 01:28:23,320
you fell down,
whatever,

2007
01:28:23,350 --> 01:28:28,350
maybe getting a little weird and I keep 
going and we had a little problem with 

2008
01:28:28,350 --> 01:28:29,000
the mules.
These mules,

2009
01:28:29,001 --> 01:28:31,370
we were going over the snow pass in the 
mules,

2010
01:28:31,371 --> 01:28:33,440
couldn't get through it,
so they had to turn these meals around,

2011
01:28:33,441 --> 01:28:35,780
send them back.
They couldn't get through it because the

2012
01:28:35,781 --> 01:28:36,410
snow's.
Yeah,

2013
01:28:36,440 --> 01:28:39,020
I got videos of,
of snow's too deep and you're talking to

2014
01:28:39,021 --> 01:28:44,021
trail half as wide as this table.
Maybe they're trying to get these and 

2015
01:28:44,021 --> 01:28:44,021
you're,
you know,

2016
01:28:44,021 --> 01:28:44,930
a thousand feet down to the river.

2017
01:28:47,180 --> 01:28:49,040
And so I,
we stopped,

2018
01:28:49,041 --> 01:28:52,160
we all stopped a second time to let 
these meals go back by.

2019
01:28:52,161 --> 01:28:57,161
And like I had to hang onto a bush on 
the side of the trail as they went by 

2020
01:28:57,161 --> 01:29:00,640
and I got back up on the trail.
You're hanging onto a bush for dear 

2021
01:29:00,640 --> 01:29:00,640
life.
I mean you could,

2022
01:29:00,640 --> 01:29:01,740
you had footing,
but we had,

2023
01:29:01,741 --> 01:29:04,320
we had filmmakers with us that we're 
doing all kinds of crazy shit.

2024
01:29:04,350 --> 01:29:07,860
Like hanging off,
hanging off cliffs and doing stuff.

2025
01:29:07,861 --> 01:29:09,280
I will make a video.
Yeah.

2026
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:12,870
To make film.
They were um,

2027
01:29:13,140 --> 01:29:15,960
and so we stopped.
We start going again,

2028
01:29:16,290 --> 01:29:21,290
most everybody gets out in front of me.
I was slowing up and I'm feeling dizzy 

2029
01:29:21,290 --> 01:29:21,290
and I'm like,
man,

2030
01:29:21,290 --> 01:29:21,660
okay,
maybe I just stood up too fast.

2031
01:29:21,930 --> 01:29:25,350
Probably didn't eat enough today.
I'm going,

2032
01:29:25,351 --> 01:29:29,550
we're going.
And at some point I just like snapped in

2033
01:29:29,551 --> 01:29:31,920
the room was just like spinning like 
crazy.

2034
01:29:33,150 --> 01:29:36,600
And I was thinking and I knew about 
altitude sickness and I knew that I live

2035
01:29:36,601 --> 01:29:40,680
in a place that's basically sea level 
and I was at a place that was 13,000

2036
01:29:40,681 --> 01:29:45,180
feet and I've never done that before and
prepare for it at all.

2037
01:29:45,510 --> 01:29:47,280
He should have can.
I mean there's not really any.

2038
01:29:47,281 --> 01:29:48,990
I trained.
I did for about.

2039
01:29:49,110 --> 01:29:51,030
We didn't really know we were going to 
go until later.

2040
01:29:51,031 --> 01:29:52,620
So I trained for about a month and a 
half.

2041
01:29:52,860 --> 01:29:53,910
Um,
but not a,

2042
01:29:53,940 --> 01:29:55,620
you can't train.
Like there's no.

2043
01:29:55,650 --> 01:29:58,200
They told me before we go,
like altitude sickness,

2044
01:29:58,201 --> 01:30:03,201
there's no predictor.
You could be a rookie or you could be a 

2045
01:30:03,201 --> 01:30:03,201
veteran.
You can get it like that.

2046
01:30:03,201 --> 01:30:03,510
Like,
it's just,

2047
01:30:03,860 --> 01:30:08,460
it's part of the way your brain loses 
oxygen at those altitudes and it's,

2048
01:30:08,461 --> 01:30:13,461
there's no real predictor for it.
And so I don't think physically I was 

2049
01:30:13,461 --> 01:30:17,151
having any problems but so,
and I don't know that I had altitude 

2050
01:30:17,151 --> 01:30:17,151
sickness,
but anyway,

2051
01:30:17,151 --> 01:30:22,040
the effects were I kind of sat down and 
I just couldn't go anymore because I 

2052
01:30:22,040 --> 01:30:23,160
couldn't get,
I wasn't about to walk on this trail and

2053
01:30:23,161 --> 01:30:24,330
I couldn't,
it stand up.

2054
01:30:24,560 --> 01:30:27,930
Right.
And so our medic slash interpreter slash

2055
01:30:28,890 --> 01:30:33,890
producer Cameron,
I'm Ben [inaudible] comes back to me and

2056
01:30:34,351 --> 01:30:35,790
starts talking to me through.
He's,

2057
01:30:35,850 --> 01:30:37,290
you know,
this dude's climbed everywhere.

2058
01:30:37,291 --> 01:30:39,120
I've been everywhere,
um,

2059
01:30:39,390 --> 01:30:44,390
and as a medic.
And so he's talking me through a little 

2060
01:30:44,390 --> 01:30:44,390
bit of the situation.
He's like,

2061
01:30:44,390 --> 01:30:45,390
this is not good.
Like if you're too lazy to walk,

2062
01:30:46,170 --> 01:30:48,540
no good.
So let's get some water in you.

2063
01:30:48,541 --> 01:30:49,950
Let's rest,
let's get some food in.

2064
01:30:49,951 --> 01:30:54,951
You see what happens.
The meanwhile up the valley go to the 

2065
01:30:54,951 --> 01:30:56,370
rest of the crew to,
to the next camp.

2066
01:30:57,210 --> 01:31:00,510
So him and I spent like 20 minutes just 
going really slow and I just couldn't do

2067
01:31:00,511 --> 01:31:00,870
it.
I was like,

2068
01:31:00,871 --> 01:31:03,330
I can't stand up dude.
I can't catch my,

2069
01:31:03,510 --> 01:31:05,430
I can't get my head to get back on my 
shoulders.

2070
01:31:06,360 --> 01:31:10,450
And so we sit down and we're sitting 
there and uh,

2071
01:31:10,560 --> 01:31:13,230
I look across this little bowl in this 
valley and I see this wolf.

2072
01:31:13,230 --> 01:31:13,680
I was like,
oh,

2073
01:31:13,681 --> 01:31:14,800
cool man,
that's wolf.

2074
01:31:14,830 --> 01:31:16,070
Get my binder is out.
I'm looking at,

2075
01:31:16,071 --> 01:31:17,100
I can't find it.
Put them back.

2076
01:31:17,550 --> 01:31:18,570
We'll go over.
And I was like,

2077
01:31:18,571 --> 01:31:22,510
Ben both over there and I see like,
I see it as like,

2078
01:31:22,520 --> 01:31:23,570
it's laying down.
He goes,

2079
01:31:24,560 --> 01:31:26,160
Shit.
I was like,

2080
01:31:26,280 --> 01:31:28,740
crap,
there's no wolves here man.

2081
01:31:29,300 --> 01:31:30,840
I was like,
oh my,

2082
01:31:30,910 --> 01:31:33,540
there's no wolves and all of Nepal.
He's like,

2083
01:31:33,541 --> 01:31:34,470
you're not gonna.
See a wolf?

2084
01:31:34,480 --> 01:31:39,480
Fear basically don't exist.
They don't exist where we were in that 

2085
01:31:39,480 --> 01:31:39,630
district,
in the,

2086
01:31:39,860 --> 01:31:41,110
in the hunting area where we were.
It's like,

2087
01:31:41,350 --> 01:31:42,540
it's not,
nope.

2088
01:31:42,690 --> 01:31:44,550
So you were hallucinating.
I was hallucinating,

2089
01:31:44,551 --> 01:31:47,340
but it was not one of those like you see
it and then you shake your head and it's

2090
01:31:47,341 --> 01:31:52,341
gone.
It was like a looking at it and it was 

2091
01:31:52,341 --> 01:31:53,380
just this,
like what?

2092
01:31:53,381 --> 01:31:56,220
It could have been stumped,
but in my mind it was a freaking wolf.

2093
01:31:56,610 --> 01:32:01,610
What else?
Losing my shit a little bit at that 

2094
01:32:01,610 --> 01:32:01,610
point I'm like,
this is not good.

2095
01:32:01,610 --> 01:32:04,330
And so then I'm sure in his mind he's 
thinking diamox is a,

2096
01:32:04,720 --> 01:32:09,720
is a pill you can take to help with 
altitude sickness and he's thinking 

2097
01:32:09,720 --> 01:32:09,720
about,
okay,

2098
01:32:09,720 --> 01:32:12,670
are we helicopter and this guy out of 
here on day two out to what are we going

2099
01:32:12,671 --> 01:32:13,510
to do?
Because it's,

2100
01:32:13,540 --> 01:32:14,110
you know,
not,

2101
01:32:14,520 --> 01:32:15,910
you know,
pulmonary edema,

2102
01:32:15,911 --> 01:32:17,710
cerebral edema.
That's nothing to mess around with.

2103
01:32:17,770 --> 01:32:19,140
It was only day two.
It was,

2104
01:32:19,141 --> 01:32:21,100
yeah.
Well Day two of the actual trip.

2105
01:32:21,730 --> 01:32:23,500
We were four or five days into being in 
Nepal,

2106
01:32:23,501 --> 01:32:25,750
but they too have the,
the trick in.

2107
01:32:26,710 --> 01:32:31,710
And so we sat there for awhile and I 
like I just look in and I remember just 

2108
01:32:31,710 --> 01:32:32,450
looking after like 10 minutes,
it's still being there.

2109
01:32:34,450 --> 01:32:37,960
This is not good.
And so we get up to go and I'm like,

2110
01:32:37,961 --> 01:32:42,961
I can do it man.
I'm going to do it because I don't want 

2111
01:32:42,961 --> 01:32:42,961
to leave.
I want to hunt and we get going a little

2112
01:32:42,961 --> 01:32:47,881
further down this trail and at this 
point I'm trying to like find some 

2113
01:32:47,881 --> 01:32:48,580
levity in the situation.
Joking with him.

2114
01:32:48,581 --> 01:32:53,581
He's joking with me.
We're just like trying to be normal and 

2115
01:32:53,581 --> 01:32:56,100
when I know that my head's not normal,
we're going real slow and I look on this

2116
01:32:56,890 --> 01:32:59,440
side hill of this trail and there's a 
fucking baby

2117
01:33:00,770 --> 01:33:04,800
that's.
I thought come on baby.

2118
01:33:05,300 --> 01:33:07,920
Like I didn't say anything to Ben about 
naked.

2119
01:33:08,280 --> 01:33:13,280
I feel like it was a really big naked 
baby if I didn't have a diaper on how 

2120
01:33:14,371 --> 01:33:18,650
big the biggest meet me.
Like it's like 30 feet tall.

2121
01:33:18,670 --> 01:33:22,200
I don't know Joe Dark Shit we're getting
into.

2122
01:33:22,700 --> 01:33:24,570
It was,
it was an unusually saw.

2123
01:33:24,571 --> 01:33:26,310
It was like a baby that

2124
01:33:27,310 --> 01:33:28,600
if you saw it on the street you'd be 
like,

2125
01:33:28,601 --> 01:33:29,710
Whoa,
what a whopper.

2126
01:33:29,770 --> 01:33:32,770
That's a serious baby.
Science should be studying.

2127
01:33:34,640 --> 01:33:39,640
Got It.
And get that big babies is on the side 

2128
01:33:39,640 --> 01:33:39,640
of the.

2129
01:33:39,640 --> 01:33:42,460
And so I'm thinking like,
I'm not saying nothing to band because 

2130
01:33:42,460 --> 01:33:42,910
this baby is like my ticket at home.
Like this baby.

2131
01:33:42,911 --> 01:33:43,310
If I'd be like,

2132
01:33:44,300 --> 01:33:47,630
baby right there,
you'd be like q,

2133
01:33:47,631 --> 01:33:49,310
the chopper.
Right.

2134
01:33:49,311 --> 01:33:50,450
See you buddy.
Right.

2135
01:33:50,600 --> 01:33:51,470
You can't make it sense.

2136
01:33:51,750 --> 01:33:56,750
It wasn't like the wolf.
It wasn't like I saw it and I stared at 

2137
01:33:56,750 --> 01:33:59,430
like,
I saw it and then I looked back and it 

2138
01:33:59,430 --> 01:33:59,430
was there and I looked back and wasn't 
there.

2139
01:33:59,430 --> 01:33:59,430
So I kept going.
I'm like,

2140
01:33:59,430 --> 01:34:01,690
you know what baby,
if you're really there,

2141
01:34:01,691 --> 01:34:03,160
fuck you.
You shouldn't be up here anyways.

2142
01:34:03,161 --> 01:34:04,400
It's not my fault.
Like,

2143
01:34:04,401 --> 01:34:09,401
wow,
you got a harsh harsh with the fake 

2144
01:34:09,401 --> 01:34:09,401
baby.
The fake baby.

2145
01:34:09,650 --> 01:34:10,390
I'm just going,
man,

2146
01:34:10,391 --> 01:34:11,560
I'm not.
Whatever baby.

2147
01:34:11,561 --> 01:34:12,840
Stay there.
Wow.

2148
01:34:13,390 --> 01:34:15,640
So I didn't say anything to Ben about 
the baby,

2149
01:34:15,641 --> 01:34:20,641
like right off and we're getting going 
and eventually I just kind of collapsed 

2150
01:34:20,641 --> 01:34:20,641
and I'm like,
look man,

2151
01:34:20,641 --> 01:34:20,950
I,
you know,

2152
01:34:20,980 --> 01:34:25,980
I was talking positively and I wasn't 
hallucinating anymore than the baby and 

2153
01:34:25,980 --> 01:34:28,780
the wolf,
which is enough and we get down,

2154
01:34:28,781 --> 01:34:33,781
we get going down this ravine and camp.
You can start to see camp guys put in 

2155
01:34:33,781 --> 01:34:33,781
camp together.

2156
01:34:33,781 --> 01:34:35,530
And um,
essentially he's like,

2157
01:34:35,531 --> 01:34:36,790
just give me your pack,
community trekking,

2158
01:34:36,791 --> 01:34:41,791
Poles giving everything.
And he held my shoulders and just kind 

2159
01:34:41,791 --> 01:34:41,791
of one step,
one step,

2160
01:34:41,791 --> 01:34:43,750
one step for a solid hour and a half or 
so until we got to camp.

2161
01:34:45,310 --> 01:34:47,890
A lot of breaks,
a lot of just him and I talking about,

2162
01:34:47,960 --> 01:34:49,750
well here's the scenarios.
Are you,

2163
01:34:50,050 --> 01:34:51,850
is this really,
you know,

2164
01:34:51,851 --> 01:34:53,750
is it acute mountain sickness or are 
you,

2165
01:34:53,780 --> 01:34:58,780
you know,
what's going on sick like the other 

2166
01:34:58,780 --> 01:34:59,420
people got so yes.
So that happened the next day.

2167
01:34:59,740 --> 01:35:02,450
So the next thing it was because of 
drinking that moonshine.

2168
01:35:02,900 --> 01:35:04,550
I think we got sick because of the 
moonshine.

2169
01:35:04,820 --> 01:35:09,820
It could have been water in Katmandu it 
commit to anything or how are they 

2170
01:35:09,820 --> 01:35:09,820
making that moonshine?
I have no.

2171
01:35:09,820 --> 01:35:10,660
I have a picture of it.
I show you like it.

2172
01:35:10,661 --> 01:35:15,661
It was,
it looked like in this big ceramic 

2173
01:35:15,661 --> 01:35:15,661
thing.

2174
01:35:15,661 --> 01:35:17,970
It's probably a bit.
Goat was walking over there licking out 

2175
01:35:17,970 --> 01:35:19,520
of it,
but we all did it.

2176
01:35:19,850 --> 01:35:24,110
Everybody in there got some level of 
sickness that wasn't used to that area.

2177
01:35:24,240 --> 01:35:29,240
It wasn't used to being in Nepal and 
eating food and drinking the minutiae 

2178
01:35:29,240 --> 01:35:29,240
and all that.
So who knows?

2179
01:35:29,240 --> 01:35:31,480
It was the moonshine that was behind 
getting it could've been any.

2180
01:35:32,810 --> 01:35:35,420
So we finally make it to camp and we're 
doing a film,

2181
01:35:35,421 --> 01:35:40,421
so they're filming me while I'm all 
messed up and I was kind of out of it.

2182
01:35:40,491 --> 01:35:45,491
I mean we're coming down this switchback
trail to go into camp and I remember 

2183
01:35:45,621 --> 01:35:48,800
like not I much like when I fell I was 
like,

2184
01:35:48,801 --> 01:35:53,801
I'm aware that my feet are hitting the 
ground and these trekking poles are 

2185
01:35:53,801 --> 01:35:53,801
hitting the ground and like I'm aware 
that I'm doing this,

2186
01:35:53,801 --> 01:35:56,120
but I feel like I'm,
I can't control it.

2187
01:35:56,210 --> 01:35:58,760
I feel like I could be floating through 
the air just as well as walking.

2188
01:35:59,030 --> 01:36:01,430
He a weird like head detached from body 
feeling.

2189
01:36:01,790 --> 01:36:06,790
Wow.
It was gnarly and I'm at the end of the 

2190
01:36:06,790 --> 01:36:11,770
day,
I think what they thought was like it 

2191
01:36:11,770 --> 01:36:13,691
was the sickness that everybody else got
coming on at the same time as altitude 

2192
01:36:13,691 --> 01:36:17,000
and it was just my body was fighting 
this battle against itself.

2193
01:36:17,960 --> 01:36:22,960
So we got back to camp.
I think I just kinda sat in a chair for 

2194
01:36:22,960 --> 01:36:22,960
awhile and said a lot of weird stuff.

2195
01:36:27,110 --> 01:36:28,700
I think I said like a

2196
01:36:29,200 --> 01:36:30,620
when I think I said,
um,

2197
01:36:30,621 --> 01:36:35,621
what's the name of this mountain?
Because that's you got to know the name 

2198
01:36:35,621 --> 01:36:38,421
of what's going to kill you or something
weird like don't this mountains out to 

2199
01:36:38,421 --> 01:36:38,421
get us.
Joe,

2200
01:36:38,421 --> 01:36:39,690
were you thinking about your family?
Yeah.

2201
01:36:39,780 --> 01:36:40,680
Hell yeah.
Right.

2202
01:36:40,710 --> 01:36:42,120
That's the first thing you think about 
what?

2203
01:36:42,121 --> 01:36:45,930
Sharing the bad situation in the woods.
Why did I come here?

2204
01:36:46,260 --> 01:36:48,530
Why do I have to be this adventuring 
asshole and that,

2205
01:36:48,531 --> 01:36:50,160
yes,
that 100 percent.

2206
01:36:50,220 --> 01:36:55,220
I think I was more focused on levity and
more focused on like making jokes and 

2207
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:57,780
making it seem okay,
right?

2208
01:36:57,800 --> 01:37:00,090
Because that's the only way that my mind
can wrap ourselves around.

2209
01:37:00,091 --> 01:37:00,360
Like,
oh,

2210
01:37:00,361 --> 01:37:01,440
hey,
you dumb ass.

2211
01:37:01,441 --> 01:37:03,180
You trained for a month.
He went to Nepal,

2212
01:37:03,181 --> 01:37:04,560
what do you do?
And you're an idiot.

2213
01:37:05,430 --> 01:37:06,960
You get a kid,
you'll live in Texas.

2214
01:37:06,961 --> 01:37:07,090
You.

2215
01:37:07,170 --> 01:37:12,170
This is what the fuck.
What the fuck are you do?

2216
01:37:13,461 --> 01:37:14,830
And this is your brain and body.
Are you

2217
01:37:14,840 --> 01:37:17,190
telling you dummy,
don't do this.

2218
01:37:17,340 --> 01:37:19,200
Right?
But at the same time I'm like,

2219
01:37:19,260 --> 01:37:20,970
I'm here.
It's amazing.

2220
01:37:21,660 --> 01:37:22,860
These people,
this place,

2221
01:37:22,861 --> 01:37:23,790
the feeling,
the spirit,

2222
01:37:23,820 --> 01:37:25,800
like you know,
you got to get through it.

2223
01:37:25,890 --> 01:37:27,680
Like if there was anything to get 
through then you,

2224
01:37:27,980 --> 01:37:32,980
it would be this like and so you get.
I got hardened to that fact and I think 

2225
01:37:33,480 --> 01:37:38,480
eventually I had some water and I went 
to sleep and I woke up in the middle of 

2226
01:37:38,480 --> 01:37:41,601
the night and Ben,
the magic was in the 10th question is a 

2227
01:37:41,601 --> 01:37:41,910
little medical bag and sleeping in there
with me.

2228
01:37:42,330 --> 01:37:43,710
So it was,
I feel like that serious.

2229
01:37:43,730 --> 01:37:46,410
I think they had a discussion while I 
was sleeping about do we just.

2230
01:37:46,470 --> 01:37:48,090
Does he wake up in a helicopter?
You know,

2231
01:37:48,210 --> 01:37:52,590
does he wake up going back to Kathmandu,
which is probably the right conversation

2232
01:37:52,591 --> 01:37:54,420
to have.
It's a Bob Seger song.

2233
01:37:55,620 --> 01:37:55,990
Wake it

2234
01:37:55,990 --> 01:37:56,730
up and Katmandu.

2235
01:38:00,040 --> 01:38:01,280
That's right.

2236
01:38:02,910 --> 01:38:07,910
A baby and a wolf.
Did you tell anybody about the baby or 

2237
01:38:09,750 --> 01:38:10,500
the baby?
Eventually.

2238
01:38:10,620 --> 01:38:12,030
Eventually,
right at the moment.

2239
01:38:12,031 --> 01:38:13,500
Then the baby was there.
I'm like,

2240
01:38:13,501 --> 01:38:14,850
listen baby.
Wow.

2241
01:38:14,880 --> 01:38:16,410
Let's make.
Let's make a pact.

2242
01:38:16,560 --> 01:38:18,480
I'm going to keep you under wraps for 
awhile.

2243
01:38:18,540 --> 01:38:22,800
So you're basically like tripping balls.
Yeah I don't know the science of it.

2244
01:38:22,801 --> 01:38:25,890
Somebody smarter than me can tell you 
like what actually was going on,

2245
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:30,920
whether I was just a pussy or there was 
some actual scientific stuff going down.

2246
01:38:32,590 --> 01:38:35,870
Parker joint since it's illegal,
it's legal here in California.

2247
01:38:35,880 --> 01:38:37,860
It's just hit me hard.
Keep going.

2248
01:38:37,890 --> 01:38:39,960
I'll keep going while you're doing that.
Um,

2249
01:38:41,160 --> 01:38:46,160
so the next day there's more to the 
story to tell.

2250
01:38:46,831 --> 01:38:51,831
There's probably so much detail but the 
next day we get up and I'm feeling okay.

2251
01:38:55,380 --> 01:38:56,970
Feeling pretty weak.
Like Ah,

2252
01:38:56,971 --> 01:38:59,520
this is still not,
not poisoning week.

2253
01:38:59,790 --> 01:39:04,790
Yeah.
Like that weird thing where you feel 

2254
01:39:04,790 --> 01:39:05,040
like you can't really make a fist like 
achy kinda.

2255
01:39:05,850 --> 01:39:08,520
So we did a little bit of filming in the
morning and it was like,

2256
01:39:08,521 --> 01:39:13,521
hey o'brian,
can you make it up for this acclamation 

2257
01:39:13,521 --> 01:39:13,560
hike?
Right.

2258
01:39:13,561 --> 01:39:15,740
Can you go up this hill right here?
Good.

2259
01:39:17,970 --> 01:39:18,600
Uh,

2260
01:39:20,110 --> 01:39:21,790
can you make it up this hill right here?
If you can,

2261
01:39:21,791 --> 01:39:25,030
we'll let you keep going kind of deal.
So they give you a test.

2262
01:39:25,320 --> 01:39:29,060
I could test you on Brad.
And so I get up there.

2263
01:39:29,090 --> 01:39:30,570
I'd go with one of the guides.
Roger,

2264
01:39:30,700 --> 01:39:32,380
let me get up.
We started hiking.

2265
01:39:33,280 --> 01:39:35,350
We get up over this rise.
I'm feeling pretty good shit.

2266
01:39:35,740 --> 01:39:38,680
Okay.
That was a bad moment in time.

2267
01:39:38,890 --> 01:39:40,150
I'm going,
but we're back.

2268
01:39:40,180 --> 01:39:41,380
Sheep.
Come on when sheep.

2269
01:39:41,410 --> 01:39:43,060
Let's do it.
And we're going.

2270
01:39:43,120 --> 01:39:46,900
I think we probably had five or six hour
hike into the next camp.

2271
01:39:47,680 --> 01:39:50,800
We started getting into sheep country at
that time and um,

2272
01:39:51,510 --> 01:39:54,250
we're,
we're hiking and I'm feeling pretty good

2273
01:39:54,251 --> 01:39:59,251
and we get to a spot where our main 
guide mon had spotted some sheep and so 

2274
01:40:01,301 --> 01:40:05,200
we get to where he had spotted some 
sheep and I'm feeling tired.

2275
01:40:05,201 --> 01:40:07,390
I'm like,
we're going up as we go,

2276
01:40:07,391 --> 01:40:09,880
so we may be there 14,000
feet or 13,

2277
01:40:09,881 --> 01:40:12,430
five at that point.
And um,

2278
01:40:13,920 --> 01:40:15,540
we sit down and he's glass and the 
sheet,

2279
01:40:15,541 --> 01:40:17,000
but I remember glass and I'm like,
oh,

2280
01:40:17,001 --> 01:40:19,160
okay.
And they were like so far up,

2281
01:40:19,161 --> 01:40:21,020
you can't imagine going that far to get 
him.

2282
01:40:22,090 --> 01:40:23,720
And then I,
my stomach just like,

2283
01:40:23,810 --> 01:40:25,400
oh no.
Oh God,

2284
01:40:26,120 --> 01:40:28,790
my stomach is completely screwed.

2285
01:40:29,450 --> 01:40:34,450
But start going.
You get that muscle but muscle or your 

2286
01:40:34,450 --> 01:40:39,220
butt,
like when you're holding a weight that 

2287
01:40:39,220 --> 01:40:39,220
you're going to drop.

2288
01:40:39,220 --> 01:40:40,540
Yeah,
that's what I was good.

2289
01:40:41,160 --> 01:40:46,160
Jesus,
let me say this about shitting your 

2290
01:40:46,160 --> 01:40:48,251
pants.
Everybody on this,

2291
01:40:48,540 --> 01:40:48,600
on this

2292
01:40:48,600 --> 01:40:51,060
trip was okay with it because it was 
happening.

2293
01:40:51,450 --> 01:40:54,010
It was shitting their pants was like,
it's not like

2294
01:40:54,010 --> 01:40:57,240
you're on a plane and it was like our 
camera guy.

2295
01:40:57,250 --> 01:40:59,920
One of our main camera guys are non.
Who was an amazing person.

2296
01:41:00,660 --> 01:41:05,660
The whole nother podcast about that guy.
He shit his pants I think during like 

2297
01:41:06,031 --> 01:41:08,560
day one and I don't know how many pairs 
of pants he had,

2298
01:41:08,561 --> 01:41:11,530
but I remember watching him like 
scrubbing the shit out of his pants,

2299
01:41:11,740 --> 01:41:15,160
thinking shit that's going to get 
interesting,

2300
01:41:15,730 --> 01:41:20,730
but by the time we got into sheep 
country we were all okay with the 

2301
01:41:20,730 --> 01:41:21,310
occasional short or whatever's going on.
I think it's fine

2302
01:41:21,540 --> 01:41:26,540
because your body's just like you're 
realizing that your mind has a 

2303
01:41:26,540 --> 01:41:26,540
directive.
That's right,

2304
01:41:26,540 --> 01:41:28,320
but your body is dealing with some 
pretty extreme conditions

2305
01:41:28,330 --> 01:41:33,330
and I wonder.
I always wonder now looking back on it 

2306
01:41:33,330 --> 01:41:35,461
or like how well I would have done if 
there wasn't sickness and like I had 

2307
01:41:35,461 --> 01:41:38,581
some stuff like go to Katmandu and it's 
just dust and dirt and all this 

2308
01:41:38,581 --> 01:41:41,560
craziness and I had going into it like 
respiratory issues and then sickness and

2309
01:41:41,561 --> 01:41:46,140
then visions of things and so by the 
time you get in there,

2310
01:41:47,200 --> 01:41:49,490
you know,
it really makes you respect the fuck out

2311
01:41:49,491 --> 01:41:50,740
of Jim shockey.

2312
01:41:51,340 --> 01:41:52,030
Oh yeah.

2313
01:41:52,170 --> 01:41:54,540
For people who don't know who jim 
shockey is,

2314
01:41:54,541 --> 01:41:59,400
Jim shockey is extremely respected in 
the hunting world.

2315
01:41:59,610 --> 01:42:02,130
The,
let's just step aside with that.

2316
01:42:02,131 --> 01:42:06,570
He's an amazing accomplished hunter,
but maybe even more important than that.

2317
01:42:06,870 --> 01:42:11,870
He's got a show called uncharted and his
uncharted show is so good.

2318
01:42:13,800 --> 01:42:18,800
It's so good that it really shouldn't be
considered a hunting show because what 

2319
01:42:18,800 --> 01:42:23,391
it really is,
is him exploring cultures in the most 

2320
01:42:23,391 --> 01:42:27,051
remote parts of the world.
Jim goes to these strange villages in 

2321
01:42:27,051 --> 01:42:28,910
the middle of Russia that no one goes

2322
01:42:28,970 --> 01:42:30,620
to Ivan.
I got all kinds of stories.

2323
01:42:30,621 --> 01:42:32,710
Like last time I was at Jim's place up 
in Canada.

2324
01:42:32,711 --> 01:42:33,410
I'm like,
I said,

2325
01:42:33,411 --> 01:42:33,770
he's,
he's,

2326
01:42:33,771 --> 01:42:34,790
what are you doing this weekend?
I'm like,

2327
01:42:34,810 --> 01:42:36,040
I fly home,
hang out with the family.

2328
01:42:36,060 --> 01:42:36,620
What are you doing?
He's like,

2329
01:42:36,621 --> 01:42:38,720
ah,
Bison and Poland,

2330
01:42:40,460 --> 01:42:43,040
they have bison and that's what I think 
is what he said.

2331
01:42:43,041 --> 01:42:47,240
I can be,
I can be the same kind of thing.

2332
01:42:47,300 --> 01:42:47,790
Right.
And,

2333
01:42:47,890 --> 01:42:49,250
and uh,
when I was,

2334
01:42:49,310 --> 01:42:53,240
I saw Jim about a month before we left 
for Nepal and Jim had been at,

2335
01:42:53,440 --> 01:42:54,890
you should,
if you can find foot,

2336
01:42:55,020 --> 01:42:58,340
the full episode of Jim's Nepal Hunt 
with his crew.

2337
01:42:58,550 --> 01:43:00,220
It is,
it.

2338
01:43:00,500 --> 01:43:02,510
They filmed it there,
like doing cell filming.

2339
01:43:02,520 --> 01:43:05,080
That's kind of how I felt.
Just like you're just a,

2340
01:43:05,680 --> 01:43:07,790
you're just a mess.
Just a mess.

2341
01:43:08,330 --> 01:43:11,170
And I said to him as like going into 
Paul,

2342
01:43:11,180 --> 01:43:12,440
Jim and like a month,
and he goes,

2343
01:43:12,800 --> 01:43:14,100
what?
Like,

2344
01:43:14,900 --> 01:43:15,290
I was like,
well,

2345
01:43:15,291 --> 01:43:16,310
what can I expect?
He's like,

2346
01:43:17,510 --> 01:43:19,340
it sucks.
It sucks.

2347
01:43:19,341 --> 01:43:22,970
And when somebody like Jim shockey who's
traveled the world,

2348
01:43:23,180 --> 01:43:25,190
literally the world,
it says,

2349
01:43:25,550 --> 01:43:27,860
it's going to be terrible for you little
fellow.

2350
01:43:28,410 --> 01:43:29,540
I was like,
oh no,

2351
01:43:30,140 --> 01:43:32,090
this is real.
Now I'm going to be in trouble.

2352
01:43:33,090 --> 01:43:38,070
Yeah.
Jim shockey has a a video or a,

2353
01:43:38,071 --> 01:43:43,071
an episode of his show where he went to,
I think it was Mozambique where they're 

2354
01:43:43,091 --> 01:43:45,570
hunting crocodiles,
crocodiles,

2355
01:43:45,600 --> 01:43:48,780
eat all the people that work that live 
and work in this village.

2356
01:43:48,781 --> 01:43:50,340
Yeah.
It is so crazy.

2357
01:43:50,341 --> 01:43:55,341
These poor.
These people live under the threat of 

2358
01:43:55,341 --> 01:43:58,451
monsters on a daily basis,
like half the people in the village are 

2359
01:43:58,451 --> 01:44:00,740
either missing arms or they have a chunk
taken out of their leg and one they were

2360
01:44:00,741 --> 01:44:01,940
there.
They lost a woman.

2361
01:44:02,210 --> 01:44:05,600
She was going down there either to fetch
water to wash her clothes,

2362
01:44:06,110 --> 01:44:10,280
and she got taken out and these people 
were screaming and weeping.

2363
01:44:10,281 --> 01:44:15,050
It was so hard to watch man,
to watch a bunch of people wailing,

2364
01:44:15,230 --> 01:44:20,230
just wailing because they knew this 
woman that they loved got taken under.

2365
01:44:22,101 --> 01:44:27,101
By the end of that,
the end of it where they cut the croc 

2366
01:44:27,101 --> 01:44:27,880
open and pulled a.

2367
01:44:27,890 --> 01:44:32,890
What was it,
like a shoe or something out of the 

2368
01:44:32,890 --> 01:44:32,890
cracks belly shirt or something like 
that.

2369
01:44:32,890 --> 01:44:37,690
I remember we were talking about that 
later on and that should be on a 

2370
01:44:37,821 --> 01:44:40,250
different channel.
It's so good.

2371
01:44:40,280 --> 01:44:44,670
It's so it should be on discovery.
What's his son's name that films it?

2372
01:44:44,720 --> 01:44:47,090
Brantlyn brand.
Linda's a motherfucker.

2373
01:44:47,420 --> 01:44:50,120
He is a bad motherfucker family.
Either their daughter,

2374
01:44:50,150 --> 01:44:55,150
but you know,
here's my criticism of outdoor in air 

2375
01:44:55,150 --> 01:44:59,561
quotes TV.
There's episodes like Rainelda's that 

2376
01:44:59,561 --> 01:45:01,500
are just brilliant.
I mean Rinella show or shows rather like

2377
01:45:01,630 --> 01:45:04,250
Rainelda's Rinella show is just a 
brilliant show.

2378
01:45:04,251 --> 01:45:06,620
I mean,
it easily could be on any other network.

2379
01:45:06,621 --> 01:45:09,680
It's.
It's shot by zero point zero.

2380
01:45:09,681 --> 01:45:14,681
The same people that shoot Anthony 
Bourdain's show the same people that 

2381
01:45:14,681 --> 01:45:16,520
shoot a ton of award winning Emmy Award 
winning shows.

2382
01:45:16,521 --> 01:45:21,521
It's a brilliant show and then you got 
these things that look like they shoot 

2383
01:45:21,521 --> 01:45:22,370
them with trail cams,
a bunch of dip shits.

2384
01:45:22,370 --> 01:45:23,570
They're all,
you know,

2385
01:45:23,600 --> 01:45:24,440
they're,
you know,

2386
01:45:24,441 --> 01:45:27,290
the Lord blessed me when this bull came 
over the ridge,

2387
01:45:27,350 --> 01:45:27,640
you know,
like,

2388
01:45:27,650 --> 01:45:30,260
okay,
if they just think there's a.

2389
01:45:30,340 --> 01:45:35,340
I'm a rampant anti-intellectualism,
like an embraced sort of like a fake 

2390
01:45:38,780 --> 01:45:41,120
simplicity to it.
Yeah.

2391
01:45:41,121 --> 01:45:44,000
There's like heartland pandering that 
goes on all the pandering,

2392
01:45:44,060 --> 01:45:45,100
pandering,
skidway look,

2393
01:45:45,290 --> 01:45:50,290
but then you've got Jim shockey who has 
this legitimate appreciation for these 

2394
01:45:50,930 --> 01:45:54,380
cultures that he visits all over the 
world.

2395
01:45:54,381 --> 01:45:59,381
I mean he goes to these incredibly 
remote places and communicates with 

2396
01:45:59,381 --> 01:46:03,461
these tribes,
people that live in the jungle or the 

2397
01:46:03,461 --> 01:46:06,881
mountains or wherever it is and you 
could tell that this is a guy jim is 

2398
01:46:06,881 --> 01:46:06,881
like,
what does he buy?

2399
01:46:06,881 --> 01:46:10,100
Probably 60 or so that he's getting up 
there and he,

2400
01:46:10,460 --> 01:46:15,460
he realizes that he's lived a long life,
has experienced a lot of wild and 

2401
01:46:15,460 --> 01:46:20,171
amazing things and now at this point in 
life what he really desires or extreme 

2402
01:46:20,171 --> 01:46:24,011
experiences of a humankind and also have
a wildcard in nature and was like a 

2403
01:46:25,731 --> 01:46:29,760
different level to him.
I outdoor TV,

2404
01:46:29,840 --> 01:46:34,840
they is funny just because like I do 
appreciate and have friends that are 

2405
01:46:34,840 --> 01:46:35,110
like fall into that,
you know,

2406
01:46:35,390 --> 01:46:37,140
bubble zone buzzbuzzhome.
Yeah.

2407
01:46:37,230 --> 01:46:42,230
And I,
and I appreciate what they do and like 

2408
01:46:42,230 --> 01:46:42,380
it's not for me.
I don't watch it and I'm a fan of it,

2409
01:46:42,381 --> 01:46:44,680
but I appreciate it.
Other bubbles like it and it's a thing,

2410
01:46:45,140 --> 01:46:45,760
it's,
it's,

2411
01:46:46,400 --> 01:46:47,540
it's hunting,
right.

2412
01:46:48,050 --> 01:46:50,040
But I will agree with you.
He's

2413
01:46:50,040 --> 01:46:52,380
on another level.
There's just a different level you could

2414
01:46:52,381 --> 01:46:55,980
watch Rinella is cuzdey or episode where
he just kind of like,

2415
01:46:56,130 --> 01:47:01,130
the whole theme is like sitting in 
silence and like if you're looking for 

2416
01:47:01,130 --> 01:47:04,401
the right,
talking about his dad talking about 

2417
01:47:04,401 --> 01:47:04,890
growing up and there's no music.
It's this brilliant episode.

2418
01:47:04,891 --> 01:47:09,891
It's wonderful.
And so you could watch something like 

2419
01:47:09,891 --> 01:47:10,890
that and then every once in a while 
you'll see one where you're like,

2420
01:47:11,340 --> 01:47:16,340
what's going on?
It's like there's such a juxtaposition 

2421
01:47:16,340 --> 01:47:20,961
between what Steve and Jim and some of 
these other Hartland bowhunter these 

2422
01:47:20,961 --> 01:47:22,080
guys were able to like even 
cinematically produce.

2423
01:47:22,270 --> 01:47:23,230
Yeah.
Heartland bowhunter,

2424
01:47:23,231 --> 01:47:27,390
they do a really good job with their 
editing and footage and they do

2425
01:47:27,500 --> 01:47:32,500
really good job in remy,
like solo hunters are really great 

2426
01:47:32,500 --> 01:47:32,680
timber timber net.
Um,

2427
01:47:32,681 --> 01:47:35,920
and so like there is this really good 
and like,

2428
01:47:35,980 --> 01:47:40,980
I don't know if they're pulling up the 
ones that aren't so good or they're 

2429
01:47:40,980 --> 01:47:42,160
being brought down.
I'm not sure.

2430
01:47:42,650 --> 01:47:43,930
I think it's either or,
you know,

2431
01:47:43,931 --> 01:47:44,690
like,
you know what?

2432
01:47:44,691 --> 01:47:46,940
Another one of my favorite is western 
hunter.

2433
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:49,340
Yeah,
that's an amazing show.

2434
01:47:49,410 --> 01:47:50,240
You know,
and nate,

2435
01:47:50,270 --> 01:47:52,700
Nate Simmons is fucking so good on that.

2436
01:47:52,940 --> 01:47:54,550
And,
and I will say as a hunter,

2437
01:47:54,820 --> 01:47:59,820
it's hard.
Like if you really all you care about 

2438
01:47:59,820 --> 01:47:59,820
hunting,
just want to read,

2439
01:47:59,820 --> 01:47:59,820
read,
read.

2440
01:47:59,820 --> 01:48:04,260
There's a lot of bad information.
There's a lot on television in 

2441
01:48:04,260 --> 01:48:04,260
television and

2442
01:48:04,780 --> 01:48:09,780
got like western hunter,
which is a lot of really good 

2443
01:48:09,780 --> 01:48:12,091
information.
It's public land and what he does is go 

2444
01:48:12,091 --> 01:48:14,710
deep into the back country hiking sets 
up camp and does it the hard way.

2445
01:48:14,920 --> 01:48:18,880
That's the real hard way.
There's a lot of the man.

2446
01:48:18,881 --> 01:48:23,881
It's hard to tell people that to tune 
into a show if they've never had any 

2447
01:48:23,881 --> 01:48:24,730
appreciation whatsoever for hunting.
It'd be hard.

2448
01:48:24,850 --> 01:48:26,710
Yeah.
What showed you tuned into,

2449
01:48:26,740 --> 01:48:27,960
you know,
I don't.

2450
01:48:27,970 --> 01:48:29,950
I mean it would be there in my,
there's three.

2451
01:48:30,820 --> 01:48:33,700
I feel like western hunter,
there's a few like into the back country

2452
01:48:33,701 --> 01:48:35,500
is really good too,
but meat eaters,

2453
01:48:35,501 --> 01:48:36,730
probably the one that would send them 
to.

2454
01:48:37,020 --> 01:48:42,020
I'd be like,
narration that you're going to get and 

2455
01:48:42,020 --> 01:48:44,820
the intellectual understanding of like 
how to present these subjects and how to

2456
01:48:48,140 --> 01:48:48,800
I.
Yeah.

2457
01:48:48,801 --> 01:48:50,210
You know what I mean?
That's what's important to me.

2458
01:48:50,211 --> 01:48:55,211
Like as I get along in my life and 
career and like I have a son now and 

2459
01:48:55,211 --> 01:48:56,450
I've trying to figure out what I want 
him to know.

2460
01:48:57,740 --> 01:48:59,540
Like it's important to me that there's 
good.

2461
01:48:59,570 --> 01:49:04,570
There's people like Steven now out there
representing kind of my thoughts and 

2462
01:49:04,570 --> 01:49:05,000
feelings in a way that I probably 
couldn't,

2463
01:49:05,180 --> 01:49:05,930
you know.
Um,

2464
01:49:07,040 --> 01:49:08,870
so I don't want to try.
I don't want to struggle with that.

2465
01:49:08,871 --> 01:49:10,610
I don't want to like if he says,
Hey dad,

2466
01:49:10,611 --> 01:49:12,050
let's watch them outdoor channel.
I don't want to be like,

2467
01:49:12,080 --> 01:49:13,500
oh I dunno man.
Like,

2468
01:49:14,360 --> 01:49:15,080
so I,
I,

2469
01:49:15,170 --> 01:49:17,380
I do appreciate Steve for what he does.
And there's a,

2470
01:49:17,440 --> 01:49:19,340
there's a bunch of them that are really 
good.

2471
01:49:20,330 --> 01:49:25,330
And I guess I would say at the end of 
the day I've always struggled with being

2472
01:49:26,241 --> 01:49:31,241
in a room full of hunters and watching 
the outdoor channel because we're 

2473
01:49:31,241 --> 01:49:33,230
hypercritical of every little thing.
Like why did he draw,

2474
01:49:33,860 --> 01:49:35,510
why not draw?
Well there's that,

2475
01:49:35,511 --> 01:49:37,890
but that's,
that's different to me.

2476
01:49:37,900 --> 01:49:42,900
I think that flows into the actual,
like the quality of the content and how 

2477
01:49:42,900 --> 01:49:42,900
you know it because

2478
01:49:42,900 --> 01:49:47,280
I feel like if I'm watching Nate Simmons
or Steve Rinell or Ramey warrant and 

2479
01:49:47,280 --> 01:49:48,220
those guys I don't think should be 
second guessing

2480
01:49:48,220 --> 01:49:50,220
what those guys do in the field because 
you're,

2481
01:49:50,221 --> 01:49:50,790
you're,
you're,

2482
01:49:50,791 --> 01:49:55,791
you have a level of proficiency.
To me that's like the layman watching 

2483
01:49:55,791 --> 01:49:58,020
UFC fight and go,
why didn't conor punch him there?

2484
01:49:58,330 --> 01:50:02,140
And I'm like listen,
it's fucking crazy.

2485
01:50:02,380 --> 01:50:04,810
You don't think he knows when to punch 
and when not to punch.

2486
01:50:04,811 --> 01:50:06,400
Like this is a stupid way of looking at 
it.

2487
01:50:06,700 --> 01:50:09,580
So if you would compare the UFC to 
hunting television,

2488
01:50:09,640 --> 01:50:11,800
there is no meter for how you get on 
hunting television.

2489
01:50:11,801 --> 01:50:14,440
You have money and you buy air time,
you're there,

2490
01:50:14,680 --> 01:50:15,600
you know,
there's just no,

2491
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:21,000
there's no qualified.
We'll explain that because most people 

2492
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:21,000
have no idea.
So on the outdoor channel and sports.

2493
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:25,501
So I can you,
if you want to put a show on comedy 

2494
01:50:25,501 --> 01:50:25,501
central,
you have to make a deal with comedy.

2495
01:50:25,501 --> 01:50:29,140
Central is good for real producers,
for real writers.

2496
01:50:29,140 --> 01:50:31,240
You have to pack a jet.
They're going to invest in it.

2497
01:50:31,270 --> 01:50:34,870
It's a big deal to get to launch it 
right after tosh point.

2498
01:50:34,871 --> 01:50:36,010
Oh,
on whatever.

2499
01:50:36,070 --> 01:50:38,590
They're going to be invested in it too.
If is good.

2500
01:50:38,591 --> 01:50:43,591
We do good.
Everybody combined and the cable 

2501
01:50:43,591 --> 01:50:45,640
channels that are outdoors.
Sportsmans channel is the business model

2502
01:50:45,641 --> 01:50:47,160
is not that.
If you.

2503
01:50:47,290 --> 01:50:51,940
You pay the network for the air time.
Essentially you deliver them content.

2504
01:50:51,941 --> 01:50:54,790
They have very little oversight over 
what you delivered them.

2505
01:50:54,791 --> 01:50:59,791
There's rules.
You know how many times you can show a 

2506
01:50:59,791 --> 01:50:59,791
kill shot.
There's like there's.

2507
01:50:59,791 --> 01:50:59,791
There's what?
They have rules.

2508
01:50:59,791 --> 01:51:01,030
Yeah.
Rules what?

2509
01:51:01,080 --> 01:51:02,470
Yeah,
hold on.

2510
01:51:02,680 --> 01:51:06,040
They have rules on how many times you 
can show a kill shot fairly sure because

2511
01:51:06,110 --> 01:51:11,110
you can't like shoot a deer two minutes 
into the episode and just dash is washed

2512
01:51:14,300 --> 01:51:19,300
close up with a deer's eyes.
The Arrow goes a close up on the Arrow 

2513
01:51:19,300 --> 01:51:23,881
is a good thing.
We brought that red cameras all death 

2514
01:51:24,131 --> 01:51:28,540
metal and dying feet up in the air,
kicking chicken or the egg.

2515
01:51:32,430 --> 01:51:37,430
There can be a show like that of Nutty 
fucking chose those of you that are like

2516
01:51:38,381 --> 01:51:41,110
kind of metal inspired fear no evil,
but.

2517
01:51:41,111 --> 01:51:46,111
So there are God right there are like,
I'm trying to be diplomatic and rugged 

2518
01:51:47,420 --> 01:51:49,020
there.
There are um,

2519
01:51:49,330 --> 01:51:54,330
some really good shows but,
but you pay and there's some shows that 

2520
01:51:54,330 --> 01:51:54,330
are owned by the network,
but that is the,

2521
01:51:54,330 --> 01:51:57,070
the minority,
the majority of shows are people who are

2522
01:51:57,071 --> 01:52:02,071
paying for air time and then companies 
come in and sponsor their show and pay 

2523
01:52:02,071 --> 01:52:05,671
that for that for now.
Weird though that a network on actual 

2524
01:52:05,671 --> 01:52:07,840
regular direct TV,
like you can get to a channel six.

2525
01:52:07,841 --> 01:52:08,470
Oh,
five,

2526
01:52:08,471 --> 01:52:08,950
six.
Oh,

2527
01:52:08,951 --> 01:52:09,790
six,
six.

2528
01:52:09,791 --> 01:52:11,110
Oh four.
That's the,

2529
01:52:11,260 --> 01:52:12,100
you know,
what's interesting,

2530
01:52:12,101 --> 01:52:17,101
the hunting channels which are like,
I would say overwhelmingly Christian,

2531
01:52:19,390 --> 01:52:24,390
like in terms of viewership and in terms
of the people that are on the show are 

2532
01:52:24,390 --> 01:52:28,201
literally two or three channels away 
from black dicks and white chicks on 

2533
01:52:28,201 --> 01:52:28,780
direct TV.

2534
01:52:29,140 --> 01:52:33,660
The channels important channels are like
five 96,

2535
01:52:33,940 --> 01:52:36,570
five 97,
and then he goes six,

2536
01:52:36,580 --> 01:52:37,420
oh,
four.

2537
01:52:38,440 --> 01:52:43,440
Y'all are out here representing God's 
great earth and the beauty and the 

2538
01:52:43,440 --> 01:52:47,911
bounty of Jesus Christ out here in the 
like know you're always two clicks away 

2539
01:52:47,911 --> 01:52:52,581
from the terrible black poles and white 
holes.

2540
01:52:53,210 --> 01:52:55,310
Next on direct TV,
click,

2541
01:52:55,311 --> 01:52:56,210
click,
click.

2542
01:52:56,510 --> 01:53:01,510
Jesus has blessed me with this Turkey,
longer guyer and a freaking Hyena 

2543
01:53:06,141 --> 01:53:08,180
massacre.
Electro is two clicks away.

2544
01:53:08,300 --> 01:53:11,420
That's the Internet.
This is television like you know,

2545
01:53:11,870 --> 01:53:14,930
it's.
Those lines are blurred.

2546
01:53:14,990 --> 01:53:19,990
They're going to get super blurred.
They're more blurred now than ever 

2547
01:53:19,990 --> 01:53:20,240
before.
Steven Cole Bear said that the president

2548
01:53:20,300 --> 01:53:25,300
of the fucking United States uses 
poutines Dick like he uses his mouth.

2549
01:53:25,631 --> 01:53:27,920
Has Putin's cock holster?
Yes.

2550
01:53:28,130 --> 01:53:29,750
Stephen Colbert is very religious,
right?

2551
01:53:29,810 --> 01:53:34,810
He is.
He said that when you sat it on 

2552
01:53:34,810 --> 01:53:34,810
television recently.
Yeah,

2553
01:53:34,810 --> 01:53:35,110
he's on the show.
Yeah.

2554
01:53:35,120 --> 01:53:37,520
His idea was he was going to.
This is the inside story.

2555
01:53:37,700 --> 01:53:42,530
He was baiting trump to respond to him 
and finally after he said that trump did

2556
01:53:42,531 --> 01:53:44,590
respond,
call them second rate and not funny.

2557
01:53:44,610 --> 01:53:45,440
All these things,
ratings,

2558
01:53:45,441 --> 01:53:46,190
dying,
ratings,

2559
01:53:46,191 --> 01:53:46,910
bad,
all this stuff,

2560
01:53:47,180 --> 01:53:49,070
and then Cole bear gets on TV and he 
goes,

2561
01:53:49,071 --> 01:53:54,071
Mr Trump,
out of all the things that I know you 

2562
01:53:54,071 --> 01:53:57,341
don't understand,
the one thing I thought you did 

2563
01:53:57,341 --> 01:53:58,640
understand was show business.
You responded to me.

2564
01:53:58,760 --> 01:54:03,170
That means I win and trolled the 
president.

2565
01:54:04,960 --> 01:54:08,150
He told the president fact that the 
president is [inaudible] is an issue.

2566
01:54:08,210 --> 01:54:11,040
He's trolling as well as being trolled 
the bowl.

2567
01:54:11,690 --> 01:54:16,690
Joe Scarborough and his fiance.
Do you know that whole story where the 

2568
01:54:16,690 --> 01:54:19,820
president,
a woman came to Maro Lago,

2569
01:54:19,821 --> 01:54:24,821
but she had facelift surgery and she was
bleeding very badly and he did not go.

2570
01:54:25,461 --> 01:54:26,510
Did Not hang out with them.

2571
01:54:26,600 --> 01:54:29,210
He tweeted that,
am I missing last week?

2572
01:54:29,240 --> 01:54:34,240
I got to get back on twitter.
It's so bad that scarborough left the 

2573
01:54:34,240 --> 01:54:35,660
Republican Party.
What is happening in the world was like,

2574
01:54:35,661 --> 01:54:37,520
look,
if you guys are going to support this,

2575
01:54:37,670 --> 01:54:39,380
he goes,
I'm not a republican anymore.

2576
01:54:39,381 --> 01:54:39,950
He goes,
I'm going.

2577
01:54:39,951 --> 01:54:42,320
Independent goes,
I still have republican values.

2578
01:54:42,321 --> 01:54:46,370
I felt still belonged to the gl,
but I'm not going to do this.

2579
01:54:47,150 --> 01:54:49,260
We live.
We live in strange test,

2580
01:54:49,261 --> 01:54:52,280
strangest the strangest times.
Joe Rogan.

2581
01:54:52,710 --> 01:54:54,200
That's why my tour is called strange 
times.

2582
01:54:54,201 --> 01:54:55,640
Go to Joe Rogan Dot net forward slash 
20.

2583
01:54:56,540 --> 01:54:58,670
Can you tell this weekend will be there.
You're going to be there.

2584
01:54:58,730 --> 01:54:59,330
I'll be there.
Yeah,

2585
01:54:59,331 --> 01:55:01,610
we're going to be there for.
It's total coincidence.

2586
01:55:01,611 --> 01:55:05,540
My wife doesn't believe it,
but the total total archery challenge is

2587
01:55:05,541 --> 01:55:09,200
actually there at the same tile.
Hunting is total coincidence.

2588
01:55:09,201 --> 01:55:12,350
Total coincidence.
I can't believe this baby.

2589
01:55:12,360 --> 01:55:17,360
Absolutely.
I'm doing a show in the wilds of New 

2590
01:55:17,360 --> 01:55:21,580
Mexico in September.
I always wanted to visit this native 

2591
01:55:21,580 --> 01:55:24,581
American reservation.
It turns out that they invited me to 

2592
01:55:24,581 --> 01:55:24,581
hunt bison there.
I mean,

2593
01:55:24,581 --> 01:55:25,190
I don't want to go,
but.

2594
01:55:25,210 --> 01:55:27,900
But I don't want to 75 people coming to 
the show.

2595
01:55:27,901 --> 01:55:30,230
I don't want to be disrespectful.
Well,

2596
01:55:31,250 --> 01:55:32,870
strange times it is.
I don't.

2597
01:55:32,990 --> 01:55:37,990
I must not like I do.
Every once in a while I'll flick on a 

2598
01:55:37,990 --> 01:55:38,270
CNN,
CNN or something,

2599
01:55:38,271 --> 01:55:39,680
but I don't.
I'm not one of those people.

2600
01:55:39,681 --> 01:55:44,681
I've seen people in my life that gets so
wrapped up in that stuff that it 

2601
01:55:44,681 --> 01:55:44,681
becomes.
It becomes their reality.

2602
01:55:44,730 --> 01:55:48,390
I've never been affected by anything 
Donald Trump has done in my daily life.

2603
01:55:48,660 --> 01:55:50,190
The healthcare thing is a different 
deal,

2604
01:55:50,191 --> 01:55:53,280
but.
But I think in my daily life there's few

2605
01:55:53,281 --> 01:55:58,281
things that directly affect me other 
than something that seems existential 

2606
01:55:58,281 --> 01:55:59,780
other than the environment and freaking 
healthcare.

2607
01:55:59,980 --> 01:56:04,980
Right,
but that doesn't even affect you or you 

2608
01:56:04,980 --> 01:56:04,980
feel it.
You ignore it.

2609
01:56:04,980 --> 01:56:07,480
That's part of the problem is that we 
don't like on a day to day basis.

2610
01:56:07,660 --> 01:56:10,420
It doesn't touch your skin.
It doesn't make your.

2611
01:56:10,450 --> 01:56:13,450
Your nerve endings responds so you can 
choose.

2612
01:56:13,460 --> 01:56:14,440
There's.
There's a choice,

2613
01:56:14,441 --> 01:56:14,640
right?

2614
01:56:14,650 --> 01:56:15,970
Man,
you could choose to not.

2615
01:56:16,510 --> 01:56:21,510
You can choose to create some sort of 
bubble for that news and politics and 

2616
01:56:21,700 --> 01:56:25,270
let only what's important in.
That's Kinda what I try to do.

2617
01:56:25,271 --> 01:56:30,271
I don't know if I'm always doing it,
but I don't just turn it on and sit 

2618
01:56:30,271 --> 01:56:30,420
there and watch CNN,

2619
01:56:31,120 --> 01:56:33,250
Russia,
oh man,

2620
01:56:33,860 --> 01:56:34,810
I got.
If I'm.

2621
01:56:34,860 --> 01:56:36,910
If I see a restaurant on the street,
I'll punch him right in his face.

2622
01:56:37,050 --> 01:56:39,670
You saw the news report where the 
reporter,

2623
01:56:40,060 --> 01:56:42,670
he admitted that this whole Russia thing
is kind of bullshit.

2624
01:56:42,690 --> 01:56:45,010
It's just for ratings and I was like,
well,

2625
01:56:45,011 --> 01:56:46,480
as a job,
a journalism major.

2626
01:56:46,481 --> 01:56:48,490
I'm like,
of course it is.

2627
01:56:48,550 --> 01:56:50,050
Yeah,
of course it is.

2628
01:56:50,290 --> 01:56:51,820
Of course it is.
If it bleeds,

2629
01:56:51,821 --> 01:56:52,460
it leads.
It's.

2630
01:56:53,800 --> 01:56:54,260
Yeah,
it's.

2631
01:56:54,890 --> 01:56:58,150
I don't know what's real anymore.
No,

2632
01:56:58,330 --> 01:57:00,400
I really don't.
I don't want to ever say.

2633
01:57:00,401 --> 01:57:04,030
I mean I want to look into things for 
sure that it's not that I'm not,

2634
01:57:04,570 --> 01:57:07,090
I'm not thinking about it,
but man,

2635
01:57:07,420 --> 01:57:10,080
I watch house of cards too much drinking
there.

2636
01:57:10,090 --> 01:57:15,090
Joe Rogan.
This is a not a sponsor because wasn't 

2637
01:57:15,090 --> 01:57:15,090
important.
It's Zv.

2638
01:57:15,090 --> 01:57:19,500
Do you know what I would like to know?
It's a Stevia flavored soft drinks and 

2639
01:57:20,220 --> 01:57:21,340
yeah,
it's 100 percent.

2640
01:57:21,340 --> 01:57:25,030
No sugar.
This one is their energy drink.

2641
01:57:26,110 --> 01:57:29,080
I think it has 120 milligrams of 
caffeine,

2642
01:57:29,530 --> 01:57:33,460
which is like a good cup of coffee.
Not starbucks,

2643
01:57:33,461 --> 01:57:36,010
Venti I think as 200.
So it's not quite,

2644
01:57:36,850 --> 01:57:38,350
but a,
not quite a starbucks.

2645
01:57:38,351 --> 01:57:43,351
Venti not even a grand day,
but it has zero sugar and it actually 

2646
01:57:43,351 --> 01:57:43,630
tastes really good.
Would you like one?

2647
01:57:43,900 --> 01:57:44,500
I would,
yeah.

2648
01:57:44,740 --> 01:57:49,740
Oh,
you want me to shut down this 

2649
01:57:49,740 --> 01:57:49,740
motherfucker Xavia?
Yeah.

2650
01:57:49,780 --> 01:57:51,490
Sorry,
that was really good.

2651
01:57:51,491 --> 01:57:56,491
Soft drinks to do we have any soft 
drinks in the fridge or just the energy 

2652
01:57:56,491 --> 01:58:00,571
drink?
Throw some of those soft drinks in the 

2653
01:58:00,571 --> 01:58:00,571
fridge for the next as a first time 
visiting California.

2654
01:58:00,571 --> 01:58:02,290
I got to do shit like,
like drink this.

2655
01:58:02,291 --> 01:58:02,940
Cvs.
Yeah.

2656
01:58:02,950 --> 01:58:05,350
People in California don't respect if 
you haven't been here.

2657
01:58:05,351 --> 01:58:06,160
They're like,
oh,

2658
01:58:06,161 --> 01:58:07,630
you don't even know what to do.
Yeah,

2659
01:58:07,930 --> 01:58:10,150
I've been to your many great airports 
but never.

2660
01:58:10,270 --> 01:58:15,270
Like this morning I went out and got 
like a parfait with granola.

2661
01:58:15,910 --> 01:58:17,500
Yeah,
there was some granola in there and then

2662
01:58:17,501 --> 01:58:22,501
I got A.
I went to the pool a little bit and did 

2663
01:58:22,501 --> 01:58:24,460
some emails.
Nice and drank a sparkling water.

2664
01:58:25,060 --> 01:58:27,730
Did you see any hose?
There were.

2665
01:58:27,790 --> 01:58:32,110
No.
They were in travel.

2666
01:58:32,500 --> 01:58:35,710
If you're going to travel next time you 
got to land in Beverly Hills or at least

2667
01:58:36,100 --> 01:58:38,890
go to a hotel in beverly hills.
We have the rest of today like we can.

2668
01:58:38,980 --> 01:58:40,840
Yeah.
I really need to see like the comedy.

2669
01:58:41,890 --> 01:58:44,800
I poke my head in there.
They go there tonight though,

2670
01:58:45,640 --> 01:58:47,890
unfortunately.
Yeah,

2671
01:58:47,980 --> 01:58:51,700
we would have been those cold or no 
grape soda.

2672
01:58:51,701 --> 01:58:53,920
So it is grape soda,
but it's zero sugar.

2673
01:58:53,950 --> 01:58:55,420
Try One of those.
It's good.

2674
01:58:55,660 --> 01:58:58,240
They're delicious.
And by the way,

2675
01:58:58,270 --> 01:58:59,590
not a sponsor.
I was going to say,

2676
01:58:59,650 --> 01:59:04,650
man,
I get in trouble all the time for shit 

2677
01:59:04,650 --> 01:59:04,650
but not in trouble,
but people accused me,

2678
01:59:04,650 --> 01:59:04,810
send me emails,
bitches.

2679
01:59:05,200 --> 01:59:08,230
They always think that for whatever 
reason I'm getting paid for stuff.

2680
01:59:08,410 --> 01:59:10,390
I get people got mad at me about,
uh,

2681
01:59:10,460 --> 01:59:12,880
that Yeti thing that I did,
which by the way,

2682
01:59:13,150 --> 01:59:15,550
my friend Ben Works for Yeti.
I'm going to be honest here.

2683
01:59:15,551 --> 01:59:18,370
This is a Yeti rambler and will send me 
some Yeti things,

2684
01:59:18,371 --> 01:59:23,371
but I bought Yeti shit before he even 
worked for Yeti and I was telling all 

2685
01:59:23,371 --> 01:59:24,820
amazing Yeti and you made that very 
clear to me too.

2686
01:59:24,821 --> 01:59:25,540
I was like,
ah man,

2687
01:59:25,541 --> 01:59:26,710
I worked for Yeti.
Now you know,

2688
01:59:26,711 --> 01:59:28,960
do you need a cooler or something like 
that.

2689
01:59:29,530 --> 01:59:30,640
Yeah.
These bro.

2690
01:59:30,760 --> 01:59:35,760
I already had two yetis back off.
Brian already got Yeti's.

2691
01:59:36,250 --> 01:59:41,250
They're the best.
It's there if you've never had one and 

2692
01:59:41,250 --> 01:59:41,980
people go loose spoons with.
You're right,

2693
01:59:42,070 --> 01:59:43,540
you're right.
You don't have to have one,

2694
01:59:43,750 --> 01:59:48,750
but I'm telling you if you have the 
money and you want a crazy fucking 

2695
01:59:48,750 --> 01:59:48,760
cooler,
they are the shit.

2696
01:59:48,760 --> 01:59:51,160
This is very good.
What do you feel about the ones that.

2697
01:59:51,161 --> 01:59:52,780
There's one that,
um,

2698
01:59:52,840 --> 01:59:57,840
that,
that totally copied Yeti like in every 

2699
01:59:57,840 --> 01:59:58,210
way.
But I mean,

2700
01:59:58,211 --> 02:00:03,211
they copied the way.
It's very flattering the way the logo 

2701
02:00:03,211 --> 02:00:03,910
is.
And someone was saying,

2702
02:00:03,940 --> 02:00:08,940
hey man,
this one is like half the price and it 

2703
02:00:08,940 --> 02:00:08,940
does just as good.
I'm like,

2704
02:00:08,940 --> 02:00:12,900
okay.
And then there was like this battle 

2705
02:00:12,900 --> 02:00:14,610
after I posted that in the comment 
section of instagram where people like 

2706
02:00:14,610 --> 02:00:14,610
their copycats.
It's no,

2707
02:00:14,610 --> 02:00:15,870
that's,
there is debates.

2708
02:00:15,920 --> 02:00:19,360
I mean it's a good robust debate on 
what's the better cooler.

2709
02:00:19,361 --> 02:00:22,240
It's funny that Yeti has kind of,
well yeah,

2710
02:00:22,380 --> 02:00:24,550
I created the premium cooler category 
and then,

2711
02:00:24,770 --> 02:00:27,070
and,
and when you create a category like that

2712
02:00:27,071 --> 02:00:30,520
when you and become a business,
yet he is,

2713
02:00:30,850 --> 02:00:35,850
you're going to have people that follow 
along and they kind of need us and we 

2714
02:00:35,850 --> 02:00:36,070
kinda need them unless whatever.

2715
02:00:36,070 --> 02:00:41,070
But as long as there's not,
they're not infringing on the things 

2716
02:00:41,070 --> 02:00:41,740
that are our intellectual property,
things of that nature.

2717
02:00:42,670 --> 02:00:45,910
As far as that goes.
I know as a company man,

2718
02:00:45,911 --> 02:00:48,400
we look forward like we have stuff we're
coming out with now.

2719
02:00:48,401 --> 02:00:50,740
Things we're doing.
We're not worried about people that are,

2720
02:00:51,040 --> 02:00:52,130
that are copying.
This is.

2721
02:00:52,131 --> 02:00:56,070
I'll just continue to follow along.
Look coolers,

2722
02:00:56,110 --> 02:00:57,880
coolers.
It's all good.

2723
02:00:57,881 --> 02:00:59,660
But what I.
I mean I,

2724
02:00:59,740 --> 02:01:02,230
when I find something that I like,
that's good.

2725
02:01:02,560 --> 02:01:06,400
I like to tell people about it and for 
whatever reason people always assess why

2726
02:01:06,401 --> 02:01:08,560
is that such a hard thing to get their 
heads around?

2727
02:01:08,600 --> 02:01:09,280
Well,
because it's,

2728
02:01:09,281 --> 02:01:12,670
they're cynical and they should be 
because people are full of shit.

2729
02:01:12,671 --> 02:01:14,110
There's a lot of people that are full of
shit.

2730
02:01:14,770 --> 02:01:19,770
But I swear to fucking God,
if there's ever a time where I have an 

2731
02:01:19,770 --> 02:01:20,650
ad for like the ads for my podcast,
everybody knows their ads.

2732
02:01:21,010 --> 02:01:23,110
People pay for those ads.
When we were talking about it,

2733
02:01:23,111 --> 02:01:24,190
that was my argument.
I'm like,

2734
02:01:24,880 --> 02:01:27,610
people pay for ads and Joe reads the ad.
He never,

2735
02:01:27,640 --> 02:01:30,370
he never just like frozen during a 
pocket pockets,

2736
02:01:30,371 --> 02:01:30,870
like,
ah,

2737
02:01:30,910 --> 02:01:33,190
let me just pull out.
This doesn't happen.

2738
02:01:33,191 --> 02:01:36,040
And that's like Stevia.
I have zero.

2739
02:01:36,041 --> 02:01:38,590
I bought this,
I ran out.

2740
02:01:38,591 --> 02:01:42,410
I ordered these all on Amazon.com
forum.

2741
02:01:42,440 --> 02:01:43,370
It's very delicious.
Yeah,

2742
02:01:43,371 --> 02:01:46,070
they're fucking great.
I drink this shit all the time.

2743
02:01:46,071 --> 02:01:51,071
You know why?
Because it tastes good and it doesn't 

2744
02:01:51,071 --> 02:01:54,011
have any bullshit in it.
Like this is all just zero calories and 

2745
02:01:54,011 --> 02:01:54,530
zero sugar,
you know?

2746
02:01:54,531 --> 02:01:59,531
I mean it's grape soda,
but it's clear because they don't have 

2747
02:01:59,531 --> 02:01:59,531
any per se.
It's great.

2748
02:01:59,531 --> 02:02:00,410
But look clear.
It looks like fire and water.

2749
02:02:00,470 --> 02:02:01,580
It's like the Zima.
Right?

2750
02:02:01,870 --> 02:02:03,140
That's great.
He still loves him.

2751
02:02:03,560 --> 02:02:04,730
It's not as easy add.

2752
02:02:04,760 --> 02:02:06,740
I don't have any fucking nothing to do 
with that company.

2753
02:02:06,741 --> 02:02:08,900
They're not a sponsor,
but isn't that the whole world?

2754
02:02:08,901 --> 02:02:10,780
Like facts are,
you know,

2755
02:02:10,850 --> 02:02:13,700
people will assign their motives to 
facts and like everything.

2756
02:02:13,960 --> 02:02:15,320
Right.
I could say I work for you.

2757
02:02:15,330 --> 02:02:17,960
Yeah,
I could say he's a great cooler.

2758
02:02:18,080 --> 02:02:23,080
It's the best I've ever used.
I use them all the time more than any 

2759
02:02:23,080 --> 02:02:24,350
normal person because my job and I found
it to be.

2760
02:02:24,440 --> 02:02:29,440
I'm proud to work for the company 
because it's something I can stand 

2761
02:02:29,440 --> 02:02:29,440
behind.
I still have people to be like,

2762
02:02:29,440 --> 02:02:29,510
ah,
whatever man.

2763
02:02:29,560 --> 02:02:31,070
Right.
You're just shilling for your company,

2764
02:02:31,130 --> 02:02:33,080
Bro.
But it's.

2765
02:02:33,320 --> 02:02:35,240
Isn't it smart though that people are 
that cynical?

2766
02:02:35,241 --> 02:02:35,630
I mean,
look,

2767
02:02:35,631 --> 02:02:37,430
look,
but here's a perfect example.

2768
02:02:37,431 --> 02:02:41,570
I rant and rave about the glory of a 
1965 corvette.

2769
02:02:41,750 --> 02:02:44,810
I don't work for 1965 corvettes.
Okay.

2770
02:02:44,860 --> 02:02:49,860
Well it's just like there's a reality 
about certain things that are awesome 

2771
02:02:49,860 --> 02:02:51,620
that people have created that I 
celebrate and I don't.

2772
02:02:51,680 --> 02:02:55,420
I don't say I'm not going to talk about 
z via because they're not a sponsor.

2773
02:02:55,440 --> 02:02:58,130
I'm not going to talk about Yeti because
they're not a sponsor.

2774
02:02:58,630 --> 02:03:00,710
It's interesting to me.
It's all interesting.

2775
02:03:00,711 --> 02:03:02,690
I like,
I like when people get it right.

2776
02:03:03,020 --> 02:03:08,020
You have this like this podcast where 
you've done your closing on a thousand 

2777
02:03:08,020 --> 02:03:09,230
episodes and if you remove like all 
consumer products from the conversation,

2778
02:03:09,260 --> 02:03:14,260
it would suck.
The problem is people boiled down 

2779
02:03:14,540 --> 02:03:19,540
innovation to a consumer product.
They boil it down to a material 

2780
02:03:19,540 --> 02:03:21,230
possession that somebody has to 
purchase.

2781
02:03:21,320 --> 02:03:23,900
Right.
I'm not looking at it that way.

2782
02:03:23,901 --> 02:03:28,901
I'm being honest when I'm.
When I'm looking at something that 

2783
02:03:28,901 --> 02:03:28,901
someone had someone create some new 
innovation,

2784
02:03:28,940 --> 02:03:31,700
I'm looking at like,
oh look what they did.

2785
02:03:31,760 --> 02:03:33,110
Oh yeah.
I wish.

2786
02:03:33,130 --> 02:03:36,050
I wish I could have figured that out.
Like what is it?

2787
02:03:36,230 --> 02:03:38,150
I don't even think that because I'm not 
an inventor,

2788
02:03:38,151 --> 02:03:38,960
but I do.

2789
02:03:39,140 --> 02:03:42,050
I do get excited about only archery side
of things.

2790
02:03:42,080 --> 02:03:44,810
Bluetooth.
Is that really,

2791
02:03:44,850 --> 02:03:46,190
that link I sent you?
That is real.

2792
02:03:46,220 --> 02:03:48,530
It's real.
What's it called?

2793
02:03:48,590 --> 02:03:50,990
What's the name of the company?
The bread crumb tech.

2794
02:03:52,320 --> 02:03:57,320
Bluetooth knocks.
The problem is I'm shooting 86 pounds,

2795
02:03:57,401 --> 02:04:02,000
so I'm here to have a strong man's 
listen.

2796
02:04:02,030 --> 02:04:03,680
There's not going to be any knocks 
poking out.

2797
02:04:03,681 --> 02:04:06,860
We can track those things.
A lot of people tell you know through me

2798
02:04:06,861 --> 02:04:11,861
to tell you,
just to just dial it down a little bit 

2799
02:04:11,861 --> 02:04:11,861
too.
A little bit.

2800
02:04:11,861 --> 02:04:12,370
For Real.
Yeah,

2801
02:04:12,440 --> 02:04:13,590
for real.
I've had a couple people say,

2802
02:04:14,270 --> 02:04:17,030
you can't be promoted shooting that much
poundage.

2803
02:04:17,120 --> 02:04:21,260
I just want you motherfuckers check out 
the show might go this way.

2804
02:04:21,790 --> 02:04:26,790
I don't understand why people don't.
It doesn't factor into their mind that 

2805
02:04:26,790 --> 02:04:29,240
some people are stronger than them.
It's true.

2806
02:04:29,540 --> 02:04:32,660
Like if you pull 60 pounds,
I don't feel bad.

2807
02:04:32,750 --> 02:04:35,570
I'm not upset at you.
Look at these things.

2808
02:04:35,571 --> 02:04:40,571
Look.
So they shoot this Arrow and then with 

2809
02:04:40,891 --> 02:04:45,891
your phone you can track the knock 
through a bluetooth device that has some

2810
02:04:46,171 --> 02:04:48,540
sort of a gps locator on it.
Oh,

2811
02:04:48,541 --> 02:04:50,370
you shoot it in the grass,
which I do often.

2812
02:04:51,080 --> 02:04:52,470
He missed it.
That's my best brand.

2813
02:04:52,500 --> 02:04:57,500
Bates.
Brandon Bates from a or mef rocky 

2814
02:04:57,500 --> 02:04:57,500
mountain elk foundation.
Good man.

2815
02:04:57,570 --> 02:04:59,930
Let's get into America.
Had on America.

2816
02:04:59,950 --> 02:05:01,470
I got to America.
Case for my phone.

2817
02:05:02,190 --> 02:05:03,060
America,
America.

2818
02:05:03,900 --> 02:05:08,900
Nothing better than wait till we have 
the new studio and the America flag in 

2819
02:05:08,900 --> 02:05:09,300
the background.
The flag we got sitting back there.

2820
02:05:09,301 --> 02:05:11,630
Jamie.
God Damn Gory.

2821
02:05:11,700 --> 02:05:13,680
Have you previewed the new student?
The new CEO,

2822
02:05:13,681 --> 02:05:14,710
but he knows anything.
Oh,

2823
02:05:14,711 --> 02:05:16,690
okay.
There's not a new studio when it.

2824
02:05:16,740 --> 02:05:18,270
When it comes,
it will be epic.

2825
02:05:19,150 --> 02:05:21,780
You guys don't worry about it,
but these knocks,

2826
02:05:21,840 --> 02:05:25,110
it's going to be a good way to find 
arrows for sure,

2827
02:05:25,350 --> 02:05:29,940
but what's what's interesting is it'll 
be a good way to track animals.

2828
02:05:30,300 --> 02:05:34,740
If you shoot an animal,
like a lot of times people will shoot an

2829
02:05:34,741 --> 02:05:39,390
animal and the animal runs and it's in 
thick cover and you can't find it.

2830
02:05:39,690 --> 02:05:41,550
It's dead.
It died quick.

2831
02:05:41,551 --> 02:05:46,551
Like an animal can run 200 yards inside 
of a few seconds and die immediately and

2832
02:05:48,181 --> 02:05:50,160
you might never find it,
so if you shoot exactly where,

2833
02:05:50,161 --> 02:05:51,720
even though you put a hole on each of 
his lungs.

2834
02:05:52,200 --> 02:05:57,200
Yeah,
the two inch dynamic diameter range 

2835
02:05:57,200 --> 02:05:57,200
brought out or one and a quarter or 
whatever.

2836
02:05:57,200 --> 02:05:58,830
Whatever it is,
it can run 100 yards.

2837
02:05:59,370 --> 02:06:01,980
Examples that place we were at a Texas.
Oh yeah.

2838
02:06:03,030 --> 02:06:07,380
This place had these scrub oaks that 
were six feet tall and you could not get

2839
02:06:07,381 --> 02:06:09,690
into and the animals you would shoot 
one.

2840
02:06:10,080 --> 02:06:11,850
The guys were talking to us about pigs,
like,

2841
02:06:11,851 --> 02:06:14,350
yeah,
we had a pig contest and shot three last

2842
02:06:14,360 --> 02:06:16,920
two.
What was wrong with you?

2843
02:06:17,220 --> 02:06:19,290
And it didn't make sense until you go 
there you go,

2844
02:06:19,320 --> 02:06:19,840
oh yeah,
hey,

2845
02:06:19,841 --> 02:06:23,310
are you going to find that lead there?
How would we go there?

2846
02:06:23,311 --> 02:06:24,730
Like why would we do that?
Well,

2847
02:06:24,740 --> 02:06:26,950
we just need to trim that stuff.
Yeah,

2848
02:06:27,300 --> 02:06:28,920
it's just.
Should've talked to them about that.

2849
02:06:28,921 --> 02:06:33,921
I don't.
I think they kind of knew where they 

2850
02:06:33,921 --> 02:06:33,921
were putting it off,
but it was just like trees as Christ.

2851
02:06:33,921 --> 02:06:37,080
You have so much Bush.
Well there's any place that you hunt,

2852
02:06:37,081 --> 02:06:40,590
like especially when you think about 
recovering game even though will not.

2853
02:06:40,650 --> 02:06:43,140
You think it's fairly flat place.
Like if I shoot a deer,

2854
02:06:43,141 --> 02:06:48,141
I'll see it go down or whatever.
It goes behind a bush or it goes over a 

2855
02:06:48,141 --> 02:06:48,480
rise and you go and you're like,
oh crap.

2856
02:06:48,690 --> 02:06:53,690
Well how about the place that we were at
the last day where the grass was six 

2857
02:06:53,690 --> 02:06:56,961
feet high and the animals were in the 
grass when they were waiting.

2858
02:06:57,930 --> 02:07:01,590
What's crazy was ben and I were there.
I shot at this one,

2859
02:07:01,591 --> 02:07:04,650
deer and other deer that were like 30 
feet away from us,

2860
02:07:04,710 --> 02:07:07,620
jumped out of the bushes like they were 
hiding.

2861
02:07:07,621 --> 02:07:09,060
They,
they heard us talking,

2862
02:07:09,061 --> 02:07:11,640
they knew we were there and they just 
laid low.

2863
02:07:11,760 --> 02:07:13,140
Yeah,
well they like,

2864
02:07:13,590 --> 02:07:16,380
they laid low and then you shot an arrow
and they were like,

2865
02:07:16,740 --> 02:07:18,000
I know what that sounds like.
Yeah.

2866
02:07:18,001 --> 02:07:23,001
And they ran off and I,
we knew they didn't cross into the next 

2867
02:07:23,001 --> 02:07:23,001
little paddock,
like the next across this road.

2868
02:07:23,001 --> 02:07:27,981
So I circled around and got up on this 
mound so I could see into the grass and 

2869
02:07:27,981 --> 02:07:29,370
I could see it in there.
They're just like talking to her like,

2870
02:07:29,371 --> 02:07:30,780
Shit,
what do we do?

2871
02:07:33,390 --> 02:07:35,980
Joe Rogan's.
I was trying

2872
02:07:35,980 --> 02:07:37,600
to get you to go in there,
but you were what,

2873
02:07:37,601 --> 02:07:40,120
like six feet away from these things by 
the time,

2874
02:07:40,250 --> 02:07:42,860
by the time we got to him I was no,
no further.

2875
02:07:42,861 --> 02:07:44,420
Within 15 feet.
Yeah.

2876
02:07:45,200 --> 02:07:47,540
Jargon an to here that has sort of grown
out of his head.

2877
02:07:47,840 --> 02:07:50,300
Multiple pretty crazy,
but they're just.

2878
02:07:50,390 --> 02:07:55,280
Animals evolved to experience whatever 
the dangers of their environment are.

2879
02:07:55,310 --> 02:07:57,700
There dangers are 100 percent people.
Yeah.

2880
02:07:58,370 --> 02:08:03,370
That animals probably four or five years
old had been around people for four or 

2881
02:08:03,370 --> 02:08:03,370
five years.
I was like,

2882
02:08:03,370 --> 02:08:04,670
oh,
I get it when people are around,

2883
02:08:04,790 --> 02:08:05,960
they're trying to eat you,
man.

2884
02:08:06,140 --> 02:08:07,790
People have never gotten me in this 
grass.

2885
02:08:08,800 --> 02:08:11,120
Yeah.
Nobody else has ever been able to do it.

2886
02:08:11,240 --> 02:08:16,240
So how did you,
how did the Nepal thing and you get it 

2887
02:08:16,240 --> 02:08:16,240
together,

2888
02:08:16,490 --> 02:08:18,740
get it together?
I think we left off at.

2889
02:08:18,830 --> 02:08:22,820
I started to get sick while the whole 
next day I was puking shit and,

2890
02:08:23,200 --> 02:08:25,850
and just,
I had the flu.

2891
02:08:25,851 --> 02:08:27,920
Everybody else got.
But I just got it like two days later.

2892
02:08:28,970 --> 02:08:33,970
And so it was that day.
The first day we'd seen sheep,

2893
02:08:34,551 --> 02:08:39,551
so we were three,
I think four days into the end of the 

2894
02:08:39,551 --> 02:08:41,771
track and we were camping somewhere at 
14,000

2895
02:08:41,901 --> 02:08:43,470
feet.
And um,

2896
02:08:44,240 --> 02:08:46,430
the next day the guy was with another 
guy that had a tag.

2897
02:08:46,431 --> 02:08:49,720
Coal goes up,
shoots a sheep and like six,

2898
02:08:49,790 --> 02:08:53,390
like they climb up to thousand feet,
60 mile an hour,

2899
02:08:53,391 --> 02:08:55,310
wind bursts,
microbursts,

2900
02:08:55,680 --> 02:08:58,940
frostbite conditions like these guys 
when they came back,

2901
02:08:58,941 --> 02:09:02,330
looked beaten.
And these are cold Kramer,

2902
02:09:02,331 --> 02:09:05,660
who we went with is a Kodiak Alaska bear
guide and a mountain hunter.

2903
02:09:05,750 --> 02:09:08,400
And His hardcores gets.
And uh,

2904
02:09:08,401 --> 02:09:13,401
I looked at his face when he got back 
and I had just been in my 10 old day 

2905
02:09:13,401 --> 02:09:15,100
puking and trying to stay alive and I 
looked at his face and he's like,

2906
02:09:15,140 --> 02:09:15,830
oh my God.

2907
02:09:16,150 --> 02:09:18,740
And I thought I can't make it over there
to the latrine,

2908
02:09:19,190 --> 02:09:21,770
let alone up this mountain to kill a 
sheep.

2909
02:09:22,300 --> 02:09:27,300
Um,
and so I kinda had resigned myself to 

2910
02:09:27,300 --> 02:09:27,300
like,
this is it,

2911
02:09:27,300 --> 02:09:27,300
man,
I can't,

2912
02:09:27,300 --> 02:09:29,090
I wish I was healthy enough to do it,
but that's,

2913
02:09:29,091 --> 02:09:34,091
I don't want to get up there and then 
have issues and not be able to get 

2914
02:09:34,091 --> 02:09:36,630
helicopter rescue.
And so we,

2915
02:09:36,770 --> 02:09:41,770
we talked about it but the worst part,
and I'll just have to tell us just 

2916
02:09:41,770 --> 02:09:45,170
because it's like the low point of my 
trip there.

2917
02:09:46,250 --> 02:09:48,560
The third night in the,
when we got to camp,

2918
02:09:49,670 --> 02:09:52,580
I was puking in the vestibule of my tent
and all the,

2919
02:09:52,740 --> 02:09:55,700
all the,
the Nepali guys or are you okay?

2920
02:09:55,701 --> 02:09:56,780
You okay?
Okay.

2921
02:09:57,920 --> 02:09:58,850
No,
not okay.

2922
02:09:58,910 --> 02:10:02,060
I'm puking and then fell asleep.
Woke back up.

2923
02:10:02,100 --> 02:10:04,640
I had to go to the bathroom.
Then the medic is there.

2924
02:10:04,641 --> 02:10:06,380
He's helping me to the bathroom,
like I can't,

2925
02:10:06,400 --> 02:10:07,820
I'm not gonna make it,
I can't stand up,

2926
02:10:08,330 --> 02:10:13,330
so I literally just Kinda like huddled 
over in the snow and pull my pants down 

2927
02:10:13,330 --> 02:10:15,770
and just write it in the middle of camp.
Just let it go

2928
02:10:19,040 --> 02:10:19,460
and

2929
02:10:19,900 --> 02:10:21,970
I just remember do it.
Like just thinking,

2930
02:10:22,510 --> 02:10:27,510
oh my God.
And I look up and there's all these 

2931
02:10:27,510 --> 02:10:27,510
porters,
Sherpas with their headlamps on.

2932
02:10:27,510 --> 02:10:28,470
Okay,
that's that bad.

2933
02:10:28,480 --> 02:10:29,320
You okay?
I'm like,

2934
02:10:29,810 --> 02:10:32,570
look at me.
I'm dying.

2935
02:10:33,820 --> 02:10:33,940
And

2936
02:10:33,980 --> 02:10:38,980
so that was the lowest point of the trip
and that I think the next day cold 

2937
02:10:40,641 --> 02:10:45,641
killed a sheep.
The day after that I went up the 

2938
02:10:45,641 --> 02:10:47,360
mountain with a both in mid day just for
another,

2939
02:10:47,361 --> 02:10:48,830
like acclimation.
Could I make it?

2940
02:10:50,390 --> 02:10:52,190
We got into a group of sheep,
didn't make it happen,

2941
02:10:52,191 --> 02:10:55,070
but I went up the mountain basically 
probably 1200 feet,

2942
02:10:55,071 --> 02:10:57,650
just a good climb.
Went back down there like,

2943
02:10:57,651 --> 02:11:02,651
okay,
tomorrow is kind of the last chance 

2944
02:11:02,651 --> 02:11:02,651
because we're almost out of areas to 
hunt these sheep.

2945
02:11:02,870 --> 02:11:06,860
And we went up the valley,
I want to say like eight miles.

2946
02:11:06,890 --> 02:11:08,180
I got,
I got it written down somewhere,

2947
02:11:08,230 --> 02:11:13,230
88 miles and being on death's door to 
his store and I wasn't to be the 100 

2948
02:11:14,331 --> 02:11:16,490
percent on it.
I wasn't carrying a pack or anything.

2949
02:11:16,491 --> 02:11:20,300
I just had trekking poles and a bio 
harness and I was just like one foot,

2950
02:11:20,301 --> 02:11:25,301
one foot and we got into these mountain 
passes in these valleys where there was 

2951
02:11:25,301 --> 02:11:28,661
like two,
three feet of snow and it was frozen on 

2952
02:11:28,661 --> 02:11:29,930
the top and you were just like every 
step you would crunch two feet down,

2953
02:11:29,931 --> 02:11:31,490
like boom,
boom.

2954
02:11:31,670 --> 02:11:36,140
And it was an hour of that and there was
a time during that where we,

2955
02:11:36,740 --> 02:11:41,740
we summited this,
the probably the highest peak we were 

2956
02:11:41,740 --> 02:11:41,740
at,
which is mid 15,

2957
02:11:41,740 --> 02:11:44,200
close to 16 and I was just like,
I can't this.

2958
02:11:44,310 --> 02:11:48,500
I hope the sheep are right there because
this is it like this as far as I can go.

2959
02:11:49,550 --> 02:11:54,550
And we rested and we glassy sheep and 
there they are like a mile and a half 

2960
02:11:54,550 --> 02:11:58,450
away.
Found this other giant ravine and up on 

2961
02:11:58,450 --> 02:12:02,411
this other flat.
And I remember even the guys who were 

2962
02:12:02,411 --> 02:12:05,051
with looking at like,
he's not gonna be able to go over there 

2963
02:12:05,051 --> 02:12:05,150
and I just,
I just remember thinking like,

2964
02:12:05,151 --> 02:12:07,460
this is what I'm doing it like I'm just 
going to go.

2965
02:12:07,760 --> 02:12:11,030
And we slid on our butts,
like down the side of this mountain.

2966
02:12:11,031 --> 02:12:14,270
Me and two guides slid on our butts down
the side of the snowy.

2967
02:12:14,480 --> 02:12:16,400
Icy Bank.
Got Up,

2968
02:12:16,730 --> 02:12:19,700
walked a half a mile,
popped up over this ridge there.

2969
02:12:19,701 --> 02:12:22,940
The sheep are within 300 yards.
In about 20 minutes.

2970
02:12:22,941 --> 02:12:24,530
I got,
got on a big Ram and shot him.

2971
02:12:25,070 --> 02:12:26,500
Wow.
And uh,

2972
02:12:27,450 --> 02:12:29,420
yeah.
And there was no celebration.

2973
02:12:29,540 --> 02:12:31,970
There was no,
I wasn't even happy,

2974
02:12:31,971 --> 02:12:33,230
I don't think because you're so out of 
it.

2975
02:12:33,231 --> 02:12:38,231
Yeah.
I think I just kinda like slumped over 

2976
02:12:38,231 --> 02:12:39,821
on my pack.
I was laying prone is like slumped over 

2977
02:12:39,821 --> 02:12:39,821
my pack and like.
Okay.

2978
02:12:40,070 --> 02:12:41,790
Did you eat it that night?
Yeah,

2979
02:12:41,850 --> 02:12:44,930
they ate.
The whole thing was not all that night.

2980
02:12:44,931 --> 02:12:46,360
But Julian.
Oh yeah.

2981
02:12:46,790 --> 02:12:49,420
I was too sick.
Like the spices that curry spices,

2982
02:12:49,490 --> 02:12:52,630
even the smell of that curry spice.
I couldn't even take like eight.

2983
02:12:52,970 --> 02:12:57,970
A good bit of it.
But they carried up your shit on 

2984
02:12:57,970 --> 02:12:57,970
everything.
But even the tent smelled like that.

2985
02:12:57,970 --> 02:12:59,030
So I like the cook tent.

2986
02:12:59,030 --> 02:13:00,650
I couldn't even really be in there.
It was.

2987
02:13:00,730 --> 02:13:02,630
I end up just eating rice for a couple 
days.

2988
02:13:02,680 --> 02:13:07,680
I just couldn't walk.
Couldn't stomach because it just such a 

2989
02:13:07,680 --> 02:13:09,230
gnarly experience.
So everybody ate your sheep,

2990
02:13:09,590 --> 02:13:11,330
like you didn't even bring it back?
No,

2991
02:13:11,331 --> 02:13:12,890
you can't bring the meat back here.
Anyways.

2992
02:13:13,490 --> 02:13:14,870
So the point was,
so they had,

2993
02:13:14,990 --> 02:13:18,920
they had mostly already eaten cold sheep
within a day and a half or two days.

2994
02:13:19,880 --> 02:13:21,320
And I'm talking 20 people,
Twenty four,

2995
02:13:21,440 --> 02:13:22,690
25 of.
Oh Wow.

2996
02:13:22,720 --> 02:13:23,290
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

2997
02:13:23,300 --> 02:13:27,020
That burden and through the burning.
And not only did they eat the eyeballs,

2998
02:13:27,250 --> 02:13:30,340
we so call a shot a sheep and he was 
keeping out the head,

2999
02:13:30,370 --> 02:13:33,090
take the off head,
pop the eyeballs out.

3000
02:13:33,091 --> 02:13:36,300
And I think jokingly handed to one of 
the porters like,

3001
02:13:36,690 --> 02:13:37,650
ha,
eat this.

3002
02:13:38,040 --> 02:13:43,040
And I haven't watched that dude put it 
on the stick and put it over a fire and 

3003
02:13:43,040 --> 02:13:43,040
eat it.

3004
02:13:43,040 --> 02:13:43,520
Yeah,
well I wouldn't.

3005
02:13:43,540 --> 02:13:46,200
I mean that's meat.
So they didn't see this personally,

3006
02:13:46,201 --> 02:13:47,880
but they were picky.
Yeah.

3007
02:13:47,881 --> 02:13:51,780
They took the punch to the gut sack and 
cut it open,

3008
02:13:51,781 --> 02:13:56,460
flat out the insights and took it back 
and cook that too.

3009
02:13:56,461 --> 02:14:01,461
You know,
it's Kinda like a Pegasus try kind of 

3010
02:14:01,461 --> 02:14:03,240
thing.
And so I mean they just like,

3011
02:14:04,230 --> 02:14:06,510
they just devoured the thing.
Would you go back?

3012
02:14:08,160 --> 02:14:10,160
Yeah,
yeah,

3013
02:14:10,490 --> 02:14:12,030
yeah.
I'm going to northwest territories.

3014
02:14:12,031 --> 02:14:15,070
That's going to suck a then we'll be bad
though.

3015
02:14:15,140 --> 02:14:15,900
Yeah,
that's what I'm saying.

3016
02:14:15,910 --> 02:14:20,910
I think about like,
I often think about like what if I'm 

3017
02:14:20,910 --> 02:14:21,000
glad it happened the way it did because 
I get,

3018
02:14:21,140 --> 02:14:26,140
I got so much perspective on the way 
back because we still had two days to 

3019
02:14:26,140 --> 02:14:26,670
hike out,
to get back to Tia,

3020
02:14:26,671 --> 02:14:29,700
picked up to go to go back to Katmandu.
It was two and a half,

3021
02:14:29,701 --> 02:14:32,310
three days,
hike out and hike out.

3022
02:14:32,310 --> 02:14:35,370
The first day we were hiking out after I
shot my sheep and I had a night's rest.

3023
02:14:35,880 --> 02:14:38,310
And I remember getting back in like 
midnight,

3024
02:14:38,311 --> 02:14:38,700
I don't know,
we,

3025
02:14:38,730 --> 02:14:43,730
we got back at like 10:00
PM had left at six in the morning from 

3026
02:14:43,730 --> 02:14:44,850
killing my sheet and I was just so like 
emotionally,

3027
02:14:44,851 --> 02:14:49,851
spiritually just fucked.
And I remember thinking well tomorrow 

3028
02:14:49,851 --> 02:14:52,080
they're going to give us a rest day.
And then the guide was like,

3029
02:14:52,081 --> 02:14:53,250
nope.
No,

3030
02:14:53,300 --> 02:14:55,290
like it's too hot,
it's too late.

3031
02:14:55,530 --> 02:15:00,530
We're all getting sunburn.
And I had like blisters on the roof of 

3032
02:15:00,530 --> 02:15:00,530
my mouth from the sun.
My whole.

3033
02:15:00,530 --> 02:15:01,650
My whole roof of your mouth.
Yeah.

3034
02:15:01,651 --> 02:15:06,030
From like going up and the sun bouncing 
off the snow.

3035
02:15:06,220 --> 02:15:08,470
Hit your mouth.
What's blisters?

3036
02:15:09,230 --> 02:15:11,670
Sunburn on the roof of your mouth.
Did.

3037
02:15:12,090 --> 02:15:14,400
That's insane.
Even heard of that before.

3038
02:15:14,550 --> 02:15:17,080
I feel like that's a pretty common thing
for guys that go that elevations,

3039
02:15:17,100 --> 02:15:17,820
hikers and stuff.

3040
02:15:17,950 --> 02:15:19,470
Wow.
It might not be.

3041
02:15:19,471 --> 02:15:23,370
So do you have like sunscreen on your 
lips and your face and I'll you through.

3042
02:15:23,371 --> 02:15:28,371
I did,
but like I didn't really think about 

3043
02:15:28,371 --> 02:15:29,220
that because I was hot but I wasn't the 
field burning up.

3044
02:15:29,221 --> 02:15:31,350
But like there's photos I look at now 
and I'm like,

3045
02:15:31,410 --> 02:15:35,070
my lips are cracking open and bleed and 
I got like it was.

3046
02:15:35,130 --> 02:15:40,130
Yeah.
And if you watch shockey's episode when 

3047
02:15:40,130 --> 02:15:42,651
he was in Nepal,
it's similar like they're self filming 

3048
02:15:42,651 --> 02:15:45,231
and it's like this pretty visceral.
They get something out of that though 

3049
02:15:45,231 --> 02:15:49,110
other than the survival.
So much out of that I got like,

3050
02:15:49,321 --> 02:15:50,940
I've,
I've written this now,

3051
02:15:50,941 --> 02:15:54,570
I probably wrote like 20,000
words on the trip,

3052
02:15:54,571 --> 02:15:59,220
but I got this like amazing feeling 
first being around people that are,

3053
02:15:59,221 --> 02:16:01,170
that,
not primitives the wrong word,

3054
02:16:01,171 --> 02:16:05,790
but that removed from society.
They don't have,

3055
02:16:06,150 --> 02:16:08,580
they don't really even have the option 
to be modern.

3056
02:16:08,970 --> 02:16:11,040
Like they don't have,
they couldn't get it.

3057
02:16:11,550 --> 02:16:13,470
They couldn't get a chainsaw if they 
wanted to.

3058
02:16:13,500 --> 02:16:18,500
Like they have an ax and they need to 
chop wood and like just being around 

3059
02:16:18,500 --> 02:16:23,301
that level of just primitive people and 
that they're primitive.

3060
02:16:25,220 --> 02:16:30,220
The wrong word,
I'll think of something better than 

3061
02:16:30,220 --> 02:16:31,210
that.
But their spirit was so infectious.

3062
02:16:31,211 --> 02:16:34,000
Like they're happy people.
And you have these Sherpas,

3063
02:16:34,001 --> 02:16:35,680
importers,
who,

3064
02:16:36,100 --> 02:16:37,540
you know,
those big sick bags,

3065
02:16:37,600 --> 02:16:42,600
the big roller top bags.
We took one to base camp because they 

3066
02:16:42,600 --> 02:16:42,910
told us,
oh we can leave it,

3067
02:16:42,911 --> 02:16:47,911
we won't take it in the hunt.
These guys would take like a 90 pound 

3068
02:16:47,911 --> 02:16:48,050
suitcase,
put it on top of their head.

3069
02:16:48,080 --> 02:16:51,610
Just go walking up these trails I was 
describing like it was nothing to put on

3070
02:16:51,611 --> 02:16:52,330
their head.
Yeah.

3071
02:16:52,331 --> 02:16:57,331
They balanced everything in a basket on 
her head and all these porters a 90 

3072
02:16:57,331 --> 02:16:57,331
pound bag.

3073
02:16:57,331 --> 02:16:57,850
And they would do more than that.
Two hundred pounds.

3074
02:16:58,450 --> 02:16:59,280
What?
Yeah.

3075
02:16:59,880 --> 02:17:03,130
Head strap basket back here.
Two hundred pounds.

3076
02:17:03,290 --> 02:17:04,510
Yeah.
If not more than that.

3077
02:17:04,600 --> 02:17:06,290
What kind of disc issues?
Those guys,

3078
02:17:06,590 --> 02:17:07,380
they don't care.
I mean,

3079
02:17:07,640 --> 02:17:12,640
and they're wearing like these guys are 
wearing like sandals and some of them 

3080
02:17:12,640 --> 02:17:17,341
were born in like old sneakers and 
they're just wearing whatever clothes 

3081
02:17:17,341 --> 02:17:21,181
that they would able to gather and 
they're doing these amazing things and 

3082
02:17:21,671 --> 02:17:26,671
when they take a break from something 
that you or I could never conceive of 

3083
02:17:26,671 --> 02:17:27,870
doing,
they're like happy as could be there.

3084
02:17:28,470 --> 02:17:31,450
Their perspective on life is only 
hardship.

3085
02:17:31,451 --> 02:17:33,130
And poverty,
that's all they know,

3086
02:17:33,840 --> 02:17:35,530
but that's the only thing they'll ever 
know,

3087
02:17:36,010 --> 02:17:38,800
but yet they're happier than,
than I think maybe I could ever be.

3088
02:17:39,670 --> 02:17:42,900
Does a big part of,
uh,

3089
02:17:42,940 --> 02:17:47,940
Sebastian younger's book tribe.
A big part of it is like how living easy

3090
02:17:48,970 --> 02:17:53,970
and not,
not sustaining massive amounts of 

3091
02:17:53,970 --> 02:17:57,271
difficulty like most people do in these 
impoverished communities is one of the 

3092
02:17:57,271 --> 02:17:59,710
reasons why people aren't happy is that 
people actually need struggle,

3093
02:17:59,711 --> 02:18:01,930
which is very counterintuitive for 
people.

3094
02:18:02,200 --> 02:18:03,550
It is.
And I remember coming back,

3095
02:18:03,551 --> 02:18:06,120
there was a bunch of moments that I 
could describe all these moments where I

3096
02:18:06,140 --> 02:18:10,130
just like,
I'd be at my wit's end just thinking I'm

3097
02:18:10,140 --> 02:18:12,370
just a regular Dominican,
like some adventure.

3098
02:18:12,371 --> 02:18:17,371
What am I doing?
And I'd get to a point where obviously 

3099
02:18:17,371 --> 02:18:19,870
pleased and I would look over and here 
become this porter,

3100
02:18:20,480 --> 02:18:24,970
this 25 year old kid with a basket 
strapped on his head with,

3101
02:18:25,510 --> 02:18:28,660
you know,
100 pounds of stuff wearing sneakers.

3102
02:18:28,661 --> 02:18:31,540
And I got $400 Italian boots on and 
sixth gear.

3103
02:18:31,541 --> 02:18:36,541
And I'm like.
And it would always come with these 

3104
02:18:36,541 --> 02:18:36,541
opportune moments where I'd look over 
and I'd see that and pick,

3105
02:18:36,541 --> 02:18:39,040
oh crap,
like this person is here I am.

3106
02:18:39,041 --> 02:18:44,041
Yeah,
I am in physical pain and things are 

3107
02:18:44,041 --> 02:18:45,901
happening,
but like to have the mental fortitude 

3108
02:18:45,901 --> 02:18:46,150
that those people have and they don't 
know they have it.

3109
02:18:46,150 --> 02:18:50,540
That's just how they're wired.
And so I came back after the whole thing

3110
02:18:50,541 --> 02:18:52,540
and I remember hiking out being like in 
the front of the group,

3111
02:18:52,541 --> 02:18:53,920
all of a sudden like really feeling 
good.

3112
02:18:53,921 --> 02:18:56,860
My packs back on my back.
I'm like energized again,

3113
02:18:56,861 --> 02:18:59,140
thinking like this best feeling in the 
world,

3114
02:18:59,260 --> 02:19:01,870
that feeling of overcoming that thing 
and being on the downhill slope.

3115
02:19:03,830 --> 02:19:06,070
I'd get back just for that feeling if I 
could catch it again.

3116
02:19:06,670 --> 02:19:11,670
I think a big part of the thing of that 
is just you don't really appreciate what

3117
02:19:11,681 --> 02:19:13,960
it feels like to be healthy until you're
not healthy.

3118
02:19:14,160 --> 02:19:16,430
Uh,
I don't advise anybody to get food sick,

3119
02:19:16,630 --> 02:19:20,340
food sickness or food poisoning.
But one of the things about it as man,

3120
02:19:20,350 --> 02:19:22,540
once it's over,
you realize you go,

3121
02:19:22,600 --> 02:19:26,170
God,
like being healthy is so critical.

3122
02:19:26,290 --> 02:19:28,190
It's like everything,
it doesn't matter

3123
02:19:28,520 --> 02:19:30,230
your status,
your money,

3124
02:19:30,280 --> 02:19:31,690
the,
your friends did that.

3125
02:19:31,700 --> 02:19:33,920
None of that means shit if you're 
unhealthy.

3126
02:19:34,010 --> 02:19:34,810
Yeah,
I mean,

3127
02:19:34,811 --> 02:19:36,770
and it's the people in Nepal live in 
this.

3128
02:19:37,290 --> 02:19:40,940
They just went through a civil war in 
the recent decades and these people were

3129
02:19:40,941 --> 02:19:44,200
like at the epicenter of it and there,
you know,

3130
02:19:45,770 --> 02:19:48,530
our trip gave them jobs.
It gave them purpose,

3131
02:19:48,560 --> 02:19:53,560
gave like there's a lot of things.
Our main guide mon door didn't have 

3132
02:19:53,571 --> 02:19:58,571
shoes until he was 13 and they used to 
go hunting and they would build their 

3133
02:19:58,571 --> 02:20:01,190
own guns and he described to us about a 
couple of times where like,

3134
02:20:01,250 --> 02:20:06,250
he had never hiking and hunting sheep 
and the gun would blow up on his back 

3135
02:20:06,250 --> 02:20:07,130
and blow a shirt off.
Stuff like that.

3136
02:20:07,670 --> 02:20:09,260
They were like making,
oh my god,

3137
02:20:09,630 --> 02:20:13,430
muzzle loaders and using matchsticks as,
as a powder.

3138
02:20:13,520 --> 02:20:18,520
I feel like wow.
So there was all these stories like 

3139
02:20:18,520 --> 02:20:18,610
that,
that um,

3140
02:20:19,310 --> 02:20:22,760
perspective perspective and like you 
can't let people say,

3141
02:20:22,761 --> 02:20:24,800
oh,
your trophy hunted that sheet maybe.

3142
02:20:25,820 --> 02:20:30,150
But there was so much more to it that if
anybody would ever want to see that just

3143
02:20:30,160 --> 02:20:31,550
ate it.
We ate it.

3144
02:20:31,690 --> 02:20:32,260
Yeah,
I mean,

3145
02:20:32,261 --> 02:20:37,261
what does that mean?
What it means is people make a 

3146
02:20:37,261 --> 02:20:40,321
distinction that you did not have to 
bring that animal back in order for you 

3147
02:20:40,321 --> 02:20:40,321
to survive.
That's right.

3148
02:20:40,321 --> 02:20:41,080
So that's the only way

3149
02:20:41,700 --> 02:20:42,870
motive to me then,
right.

3150
02:20:42,871 --> 02:20:44,280
If they call me a trophy and I would say
this,

3151
02:20:44,281 --> 02:20:47,190
I would say look,
you go into a war torn area of the world

3152
02:20:47,790 --> 02:20:52,790
where after the war they don't have a 
lot of chance to make money.

3153
02:20:53,350 --> 02:20:57,450
Like the tourism is kind of died once 
you've been through or it's really not a

3154
02:20:57,451 --> 02:21:02,451
happy place to be.
And plus the place we were hunting and 

3155
02:21:02,451 --> 02:21:02,451
the.
It was the,

3156
02:21:02,451 --> 02:21:06,980
I think that the rope,
a 10 hunting reserve is like the only 

3157
02:21:06,980 --> 02:21:06,980
hunting reserve in Nepal.
Like,

3158
02:21:06,980 --> 02:21:10,830
and it's heavily regulated.
Like there's 19 blue sheep tags a year.

3159
02:21:11,460 --> 02:21:13,350
So you're thinking like everybody that 
goes,

3160
02:21:13,351 --> 02:21:15,330
how many people a year go to Mount 
Everest base camp?

3161
02:21:15,450 --> 02:21:17,490
Thousands.
I don't know what the number is,

3162
02:21:17,491 --> 02:21:19,890
but it's thousands.
I think there's,

3163
02:21:20,160 --> 02:21:25,160
we were probably within a couple of 
dozen westerners that had been to that 

3164
02:21:25,160 --> 02:21:29,511
area postwar and had brought 24,
25 jobs plus the people that prep that 

3165
02:21:29,941 --> 02:21:34,140
plus all that stuff,
so like seeing that it's pretty powerful

3166
02:21:34,141 --> 02:21:38,850
to me and shooting that sheep and not 
even given a shit whether the horns made

3167
02:21:38,851 --> 02:21:41,720
it back or not.
I mean you,

3168
02:21:41,760 --> 02:21:43,410
somebody questioned my motive all they 
want,

3169
02:21:44,190 --> 02:21:49,190
but within the system and the structure 
that's set up there now hunting is one 

3170
02:21:49,190 --> 02:21:52,080
of the more valuable things that they.
One of the more valuable tools they have

3171
02:21:52,450 --> 02:21:57,450
to get better at everything that their 
lives that they're having.

3172
02:21:59,610 --> 02:22:01,080
It's their resource,
the resource.

3173
02:22:01,210 --> 02:22:01,790
It's.
Yeah,

3174
02:22:01,791 --> 02:22:03,800
and you know,
we can look down upon that,

3175
02:22:04,040 --> 02:22:09,040
but it is a natural resource and along 
the same veins is like if you live in an

3176
02:22:09,651 --> 02:22:12,080
area that has fracking,
that's a natural resource.

3177
02:22:12,081 --> 02:22:14,030
If you live in an area that,
you know,

3178
02:22:14,270 --> 02:22:17,630
they dig minerals out of the ground,
that's a natural resource.

3179
02:22:17,631 --> 02:22:22,631
It's not a good or a bad thing.
It's just the reality of their 

3180
02:22:22,631 --> 02:22:22,631
environment.

3181
02:22:22,631 --> 02:22:26,590
And so there's so many.
I think that there is arguments against 

3182
02:22:26,590 --> 02:22:26,590
what we did.
If somebody broke it down,

3183
02:22:26,590 --> 02:22:27,990
like I always try to break it down for 
me in the side,

3184
02:22:27,991 --> 02:22:29,730
I think we will say like,
why don't you just take pictures of it?

3185
02:22:30,270 --> 02:22:31,620
You know,
what are you doing?

3186
02:22:31,770 --> 02:22:36,770
You just go up there,
pay 20 grand or whatever you pay for 

3187
02:22:36,770 --> 02:22:36,770
hunt like that.
Take some pictures.

3188
02:22:36,770 --> 02:22:41,320
Well,
partly the challenge people don't 

3189
02:22:41,320 --> 02:22:42,260
understand how difficult it is to do 
what you did like to do what you did and

3190
02:22:42,261 --> 02:22:47,261
then have this final accomplishment 
which is the get close enough to an 

3191
02:22:47,261 --> 02:22:50,501
animal where either it doesn't know 
you're there or you get an a good place 

3192
02:22:50,501 --> 02:22:54,731
where it can't win to you who doesn't 
smell you and you can take it out and 

3193
02:22:54,731 --> 02:22:56,600
kill it like it's hard to do so insanely
hard to do.

3194
02:22:56,660 --> 02:22:57,890
I've got all my own personal reasons

3195
02:22:58,030 --> 02:23:03,030
wanting to kill that sheep and I would 
also say like present a better plan.

3196
02:23:03,091 --> 02:23:08,091
Then are you going to pay what hunters 
are willing to pay and already are you 

3197
02:23:08,091 --> 02:23:09,330
going to be a part of conservation 
regulation?

3198
02:23:09,331 --> 02:23:14,331
The way that hunters are as a,
as a trekker and a photographer like 

3199
02:23:14,331 --> 02:23:14,331
give me

3200
02:23:14,331 --> 02:23:15,430
better idea.
Okay,

3201
02:23:15,431 --> 02:23:16,910
but here's the problem with that.
Their,

3202
02:23:16,930 --> 02:23:19,540
their response to that could easily be,
you know,

3203
02:23:19,541 --> 02:23:22,450
what about if you decided to hunt 
people,

3204
02:23:22,451 --> 02:23:25,800
if you paid a million dollars to go 
hundred person and that,

3205
02:23:25,890 --> 02:23:28,900
that money fed all these tribes,
people in Mozambique,

3206
02:23:28,901 --> 02:23:32,230
is it okay to go out and hunt?
People know there's surely still have an

3207
02:23:32,260 --> 02:23:37,090
ethical and moral obligation to them to,
to animal rights activists.

3208
02:23:37,091 --> 02:23:39,760
Do you have an ethical,
moral obligation to let that sheep live?

3209
02:23:39,850 --> 02:23:41,440
Yeah,
and I'm on your side,

3210
02:23:41,441 --> 02:23:43,870
but I'm just saying on both sides.
Like I,

3211
02:23:43,871 --> 02:23:44,700
I,
I really do

3212
02:23:44,750 --> 02:23:49,750
do like because we only ate it there 
because we didn't have a freezer full of

3213
02:23:50,101 --> 02:23:55,101
backstraps and because that thing didn't
occur the way it normally occurs for me 

3214
02:23:55,101 --> 02:23:56,650
there was some complexity and have that.
Yeah.

3215
02:23:56,830 --> 02:23:58,530
In my mind,
crap man,

3216
02:23:58,531 --> 02:24:03,531
you know,
am I really ever here just to collect 

3217
02:24:03,531 --> 02:24:03,531
the sheep and bring it home and show 
people.

3218
02:24:03,531 --> 02:24:03,900
But you also filming.
Yeah.

3219
02:24:03,960 --> 02:24:04,510
We made.
Oh,

3220
02:24:04,590 --> 02:24:09,590
we made what will be hopefully an 
awesome film and so at the end of the 

3221
02:24:09,590 --> 02:24:13,320
day I checked myself and I said,
did you do it for the right reasons?

3222
02:24:13,321 --> 02:24:15,150
And,
and after I looked back the trip,

3223
02:24:15,151 --> 02:24:15,630
I'm like,
man,

3224
02:24:15,631 --> 02:24:18,700
there are 100 reasons why I did it and 
they're all good and,

3225
02:24:18,760 --> 02:24:22,440
and it was what we did was a good impact
on the place he went on,

3226
02:24:22,441 --> 02:24:24,630
the animals that we hunted.
Like it's,

3227
02:24:24,660 --> 02:24:26,520
it's,
to me it's all good and I,

3228
02:24:26,521 --> 02:24:31,521
and I would love,
have argued with somebody that feels 

3229
02:24:31,521 --> 02:24:31,521
differently about that.

3230
02:24:31,521 --> 02:24:33,570
Plus you got the trip balls and see a 
fake baby and a fake wolf.

3231
02:24:34,680 --> 02:24:36,750
People pay a lot of money for.
Yeah man,

3232
02:24:36,751 --> 02:24:39,720
you get mushrooms are expensive and you 
might not see a wolf.

3233
02:24:39,870 --> 02:24:42,090
You might not,
it might not see a baby on the road.

3234
02:24:42,210 --> 02:24:47,210
I'm sure there's still like a log sheet 
or like a wolf shape log somewhere.

3235
02:24:48,180 --> 02:24:53,130
Some rock had to be something.
It was crazy.

3236
02:24:53,600 --> 02:24:54,990
We got to wrap this up,
man.

3237
02:24:55,020 --> 02:24:57,390
Let's do it.
I'm Ben O'bryan.

3238
02:24:57,420 --> 02:24:57,930
What is your,
uh,

3239
02:24:57,931 --> 02:25:01,830
your twitter that you don't use again?
I'm my twitter is at Benjamin Ob,

3240
02:25:01,831 --> 02:25:04,770
but I've never used that.
So instagram is always the better way to

3241
02:25:04,771 --> 02:25:06,420
end it.
It's Benny Ob,

3242
02:25:06,840 --> 02:25:08,900
b e n n y o b three.
Oh,

3243
02:25:08,910 --> 02:25:10,650
one.
How did you get three?

3244
02:25:10,651 --> 02:25:11,040
Oh,
one.

3245
02:25:11,310 --> 02:25:14,810
That's area code where I grew up,
but I didn't shout out to three.

3246
02:25:14,811 --> 02:25:15,540
Oh one.
Yeah,

3247
02:25:15,541 --> 02:25:20,541
man,
I created that handled when I didn't 

3248
02:25:20,541 --> 02:25:22,011
know it would be a thing.
I thought that nobody would ever see 

3249
02:25:22,011 --> 02:25:22,011
that.
Oh,

3250
02:25:22,011 --> 02:25:22,011
well now it's a thing.
Now it's a thing.

3251
02:25:22,011 --> 02:25:22,510
Let's do it.
We blew up,

3252
02:25:22,511 --> 02:25:24,770
but when we had that competition with 
the people that you work with.

3253
02:25:26,820 --> 02:25:28,330
Alright folks,
we're out.

3254
02:25:28,780 --> 02:25:30,140
We're out for awhile.
Uh,

3255
02:25:30,220 --> 02:25:35,220
we'll be back next week with a one 
podcast with my friend Ari Shaffir on 

3256
02:25:35,561 --> 02:25:40,561
July 18th,
which is the release date of his new 

3257
02:25:40,561 --> 02:25:41,470
Netflix special,
which is going to be fucking amazing.

3258
02:25:41,471 --> 02:25:45,440
It's a two part special childhood and 
adulthood right though.

3259
02:25:45,450 --> 02:25:46,750
It is.
That's what he calls it.

3260
02:25:46,751 --> 02:25:49,180
What does he call it?
Ari Shaffir.

3261
02:25:49,181 --> 02:25:50,530
Look up bars.
Sphere on Netflix.

3262
02:25:50,920 --> 02:25:51,940
All right,
see you soon.

3263
02:25:51,941 --> 02:25:52,390
Bye.
