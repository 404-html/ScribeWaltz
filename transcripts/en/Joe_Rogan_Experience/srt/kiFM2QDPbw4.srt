1
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:05,370
Hello sweet freak bitches from space.

2
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:12,030
We are here. We're queer. Get
used to it. Remember that?

3
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:16,080
Oh yeah, we're queer. Get used to
it. Yeah. Alright. Jesus. Marsha,

4
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:18,060
about 10 of those problems.
That is,

5
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:20,670
what about all the people that
we're used to it, you know,

6
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:24,730
you don't have to get all fucking aggro.
I'm happy for you. Yeah. All right, good.

7
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:28,680
Um, I'm used to it. I'm used to it. Do
you really have to yell outside my window?

8
00:00:28,681 --> 00:00:32,250
That was you walked by with a
million of your friends. You know,

9
00:00:32,251 --> 00:00:34,680
if you live in San Francisco and
you're on that fucking parade route,

10
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:37,110
boy that that route is,

11
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:41,550
that's the one ours here and I'm
taking a nap that day. West Hollywood,

12
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,610
West Hollywood. One is, is on,
and it might be the bigger one.

13
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:47,640
West high would might be the
biggest gay spot in San Francisco.

14
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:51,630
Still has the reputation as the biggest
gay spot. But how can it fuck with,

15
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:54,660
how could it fuck with Hollywood?
There's more people here, man.

16
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:56,580
And that area is all gay.

17
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:00,840
There's no one area in San Francisco
where it's all gay. Yeah. You know,

18
00:01:00,841 --> 00:01:03,330
there's areas in San Francisco where
there's a lot of gay folks that live,

19
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,830
but like West Hollywood is that one
stretch of Santa Monica Boulevard with all

20
00:01:07,831 --> 00:01:12,690
the gay bars and all that. They just
own a neighborhood and that shit is,

21
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:15,590
it's on lock. It's like
mafia run. Absolutely. Yeah.

22
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:18,750
And if you go anywhere near there,
be prepared to suck a dick.

23
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:22,140
If someone's going to stuff one of
your mouth, it's going to happen.

24
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:26,680
There's only weight. One way to find
out. Let's go to be Joe Rogan questions.

25
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,490
Everything for the gate, gay
parades. How should we dress?

26
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,910
Definitely fucking do that. You
should go. You should go in like, uh,

27
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:38,860
some real BDSM like leather
shit with fucking change.

28
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:43,020
I don't want to question that.
Absolutely. But I feel like, um,

29
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:45,330
I dunno dude. I think, oh,

30
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:49,020
there are neighborhoods because isn't
wasn't what's the neighborhood in San

31
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:51,690
Francisco just handed something
and says move over in New York,

32
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:54,720
San Francisco and Los Angeles.
Columbus,

33
00:01:54,721 --> 00:01:58,890
Ohio is now the nation's number
one gay city. Oh yeah, true. Yeah.

34
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:03,240
That's a good move. I mean, if you're gay
and you're on a budget, why fuck around?

35
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:07,860
Got a really nice spread and Columbus.
Yeah.

36
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:11,130
Why the fuck would you want
to pay la prices for a house?

37
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:15,420
Ellie prices for houses are goddamn
ridiculous. They are so stupid.

38
00:02:15,421 --> 00:02:19,230
And the money in the city too that
you like, you don't like mine.

39
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,240
I read a rent a place or rent a house.

40
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:27,050
The House across from me just sold and
it sold for like eight 50 which I'm like,

41
00:02:27,811 --> 00:02:31,590
wow, that's a lot of money, man. He'd
a hundred foot air tearing it down.

42
00:02:31,591 --> 00:02:35,400
The tear down started yesterday and
they're going to put up some right.

43
00:02:35,401 --> 00:02:39,930
But I'm saying that's the money that
like it. It puts into my mind where I go.

44
00:02:39,931 --> 00:02:44,790
Jesus is like, not only do I not like as
an $850,000 house just out of my league,

45
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:47,790
my, that's a nice goal to get
through. They're like, no, we got it.

46
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:50,250
I'm gonna tear that shit down.
I'm going to build some shit I want.

47
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:54,480
So you spent eight 50 just to get
the lot of land. Fuck the house.

48
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:57,540
Now I'm going to spend money to build my
house. Well, you know what Arnold did?

49
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,530
He lived in the Palisades.
Yeah,

50
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:03,790
he bought the neighbor and then just
leveled his house and said, I want a yard.

51
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:04,420
Wow.

52
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:08,460
That's fucking another guy was like a $4
million house and just fucking leveled

53
00:03:08,461 --> 00:03:13,270
it as wow,
that's fun place to kick my ball.

54
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:18,760
I mean he didn't even buy it.
Like move his mom in or something.

55
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,410
I need to grasp me.
Just leveled that bitch.

56
00:03:21,411 --> 00:03:25,860
She didn't want to have family close
so no thank you. That just puts it to,

57
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:28,340
that takes us to another level.
Yeah, that's super boring.

58
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:31,420
I supposed to do commercials but at
this point it feels like we shouldn't do

59
00:03:31,421 --> 00:03:33,490
commercials,
which just keep doing what we're doing.

60
00:03:33,491 --> 00:03:36,400
But I have a certain amount of weekend I
guess I have to do Ron, you'll smiling.

61
00:03:36,401 --> 00:03:40,230
I'll do. I'll just shoved them all
in tomorrow. Fuck commercials. No,

62
00:03:40,231 --> 00:03:41,140
no commercials at all.

63
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:44,590
I'll shove them all in tomorrow and
tomorrow we got Matt full trunk.

64
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:48,280
That should be at a bad spot.
Full charges in the house.

65
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:53,490
And then on Wednesday we got
Kathleen Madigan old school all time.

66
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:59,260
Woman's great actually what her top 10
all time women comedian of all time.

67
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:02,740
And we always say like you shouldn't
do that. Shouldn't categorize uh,

68
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:05,710
men and women, but you do.
There you go. So tough shit.

69
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:09,100
There's an all time black guys is all
time white guys. All time drunk guys

70
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:13,170
all the time. Gay Guys. Who
on your all time drunk list?

71
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:16,270
Stan hope number one for sure.
Not even close, not even close.

72
00:04:16,271 --> 00:04:19,000
Second a tells number two
when he was in his prime,

73
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:22,390
when it tells in his prime and he was
out there fucking hammer in it on a

74
00:04:22,391 --> 00:04:24,400
regular,
he was hammered hard

75
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:29,290
and he's a brilliant, brilliant
comedian. On top of that he has,

76
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,820
he has some of the,
he has lines that are in our lexicon,

77
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:36,460
like my personal one,
you know what I mean?

78
00:04:36,461 --> 00:04:40,480
Like he had a joke one time about
puppies and he was like, puppies pee,

79
00:04:40,481 --> 00:04:44,500
you appease. And just, he always
said like silly shit. To this day.

80
00:04:44,501 --> 00:04:48,070
I still say p you appease,
he did an album.

81
00:04:48,071 --> 00:04:51,680
He recorded it at the comedy works
in Denver. Skanks for the memory,

82
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,740
one of my all time favorites and one of
the reasons why I want to record my next

83
00:04:56,741 --> 00:04:59,710
special there. I mean I have to call
Wendy and ask her if she's cool with it.

84
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:02,680
My next comedy central special I want to
record in Denver. That's fucking right.

85
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,470
I want to record it in that
little spot because that club,

86
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:10,780
I don't think it seats even 300 people,
right? Is it about two 50 perhaps?

87
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:13,030
The downtown one is probably,

88
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:17,320
I would say it's probably Julie just
under 300 and then the other one is much

89
00:05:17,321 --> 00:05:22,150
larger than the other ones. A little over
400 yeah. Yeah, but that one is perfect.

90
00:05:22,151 --> 00:05:24,280
I went downtown,
it's like the perfect comedy club,

91
00:05:24,281 --> 00:05:27,190
but it's like literally impossible
to get a better club. It's fantastic.

92
00:05:27,191 --> 00:05:30,250
Everybody's locked in their seats.
The seats don't move all over the place.

93
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,200
Like you're in your spot.
That's the spot. Boom.

94
00:05:32,201 --> 00:05:37,201
The tables welds as the fucking floor
and because of that they've gotten all

95
00:05:37,571 --> 00:05:40,470
these people in and it's plenty
of room like to enjoy the show,

96
00:05:40,471 --> 00:05:43,120
but everyone has their own little table.
It's a dub setup.

97
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:46,150
Wendy's a bad ass bitch. She's
bad motherfuckers. She's bad ass.

98
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,700
I call her a bitch with all due
respect stories. I love her.

99
00:05:48,701 --> 00:05:49,720
She's very nice person.

100
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:53,290
She's one of the reasons why I moved
to Colorado in the first place.

101
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:56,530
She just had to run a club man. I knew
she had a real community. I was like,

102
00:05:56,531 --> 00:06:00,450
if I'm going to live somewhere
outside of La and still do standup,

103
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:01,700
I need to go to a real community.

104
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:05,090
And the thing about Colorado is
they're really fucking around there.

105
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,640
There is a lot of people there
that are trying out shit.

106
00:06:07,641 --> 00:06:10,730
There's a lot of people there that are,
you know, there's, there's good comedy.

107
00:06:10,731 --> 00:06:15,350
They're like developing their own
good real comedy way before comedy,

108
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:19,250
I did comedy. That was my
number one choice for college.
Really? Denver University.

109
00:06:19,251 --> 00:06:22,400
Yeah. It's so beautiful. I didn't get
in because you don't go floodings there.

110
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:24,720
It's crazy dude too.

111
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:29,300
Like roads washed away
completely or five people dead.

112
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:32,930
Hundreds missing.
Hundreds of people unaccounted for.

113
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:37,730
All my friends' basements are flooded,
but we saw some people on the Rogan board.

114
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:41,780
They posted photos and I saw some on CNN,
some other different places.

115
00:06:41,781 --> 00:06:45,710
It's insane, man. It's really
crazy shit. Look at that.

116
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:50,090
Look at that. Look at that
giant chunk of street missing.

117
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:54,620
There was a video that they had online
that had this giant chunk of street just

118
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:59,570
wash away in front of these people and
their cars fell into it and they were

119
00:06:59,571 --> 00:07:04,250
videoing like the waterfall smashing
into these cars. It was like what?

120
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,290
That used to be a street
just 10 minutes ago.

121
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:09,070
What was happening there
where I feel like, didn't we?

122
00:07:09,071 --> 00:07:11,910
We knew floods were coming like
there was like, really? Yeah.

123
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:14,540
I thought there was like news
about these floods coming.

124
00:07:14,541 --> 00:07:16,250
Do you remember that or no?
I don't know.

125
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:18,380
I don't pay attention until it's too late.
I'm like,

126
00:07:18,381 --> 00:07:22,180
what if there's a typhoon in
Japan? Oh yeah, there's a typhoon.

127
00:07:22,181 --> 00:07:23,930
It's going to hit Fukushima.
Oh,

128
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:27,140
they're already releasing radioactive
rain water into the ocean.

129
00:07:27,141 --> 00:07:31,930
What they call low level radiation.
It's a low, would you go Japan,

130
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:36,230
I don't want to go anymore
because of that. And Yeah,
I think that that situation,

131
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,153
look,

132
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:42,080
obviously I'm an idiot and obviously I'm
paranoid so take those two things into

133
00:07:42,081 --> 00:07:42,850
account,

134
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:47,650
but I'm worried about what
happens if while you're there
another earthquake kits.

135
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,850
Yeah. What if, you know what
if there's another earthquake,

136
00:07:49,851 --> 00:07:53,270
it hits while you're there and they
get hit with another fucking tsunami.

137
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:57,110
You know, look that if it happened
once, just a couple of years ago,

138
00:07:57,140 --> 00:08:01,190
it can happen again. Of course. And I
think that situation is very unstable.

139
00:08:01,191 --> 00:08:04,700
Like they're coming up with all these
unique and novel ways to try to contain

140
00:08:04,701 --> 00:08:07,880
the radioactive water.
Like for folks who don't understand it,

141
00:08:07,881 --> 00:08:08,714
and I'm one of them,

142
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,110
but I'm going to reiterate some shit that
somebody said that doesn't understand

143
00:08:12,111 --> 00:08:15,860
it. What they were basically saying
is you can't cool that shit down.

144
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:20,060
You have to continue to pump water on it
in order to try to cool that area down.

145
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,910
It's already melted through
its containment area.

146
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:27,500
So the radioactive waste is already
somehow or another in the ground.

147
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:30,140
So there's that.
And then there's,

148
00:08:30,141 --> 00:08:33,380
they're pouring millions of
gallons of water on that thing.

149
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:36,770
Millions and millions and millions and
a lot of it is seeping right back into

150
00:08:36,771 --> 00:08:37,161
the ocean.

151
00:08:37,161 --> 00:08:40,820
So you're getting all this intense
radiation entering into the ocean at

152
00:08:40,821 --> 00:08:43,220
unprecedented levels in mankind.

153
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:48,520
There's literally never been an a moment
in human kind where the earth had a

154
00:08:49,161 --> 00:08:52,910
spill like this where
we radiated an ocean.

155
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:57,210
Most of that stuff that's on land as much
more containable like Chernobyl's more

156
00:08:57,211 --> 00:09:01,980
containable. It's a fucked up place.
The plate. It's a dark, dark situation.

157
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:04,510
Chernobyl. But it's in Chernobyl. Yeah,

158
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:06,720
this shit is going to
go over the whole ocean.

159
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:10,230
It's getting out there and it's
floating and people are like, yeah man,

160
00:09:10,231 --> 00:09:13,720
you're fucking, you know, you're being
a prophet of doom, you know, and you,

161
00:09:13,721 --> 00:09:17,400
you don't even really know. And you're
talking all this crazy. Yes, you're right.

162
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:20,610
But I might be reading like really?

163
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:24,000
I'm not reading like any crazy,
you know,

164
00:09:24,001 --> 00:09:27,330
a conspiracy new sites that
are giving me this information.

165
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:30,060
I'm reading like pretty much
all the mainstream sites.

166
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:32,310
No one is saying it's going to be okay.

167
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,580
I haven't heard anybody that
says relax about Fukushima.

168
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:38,040
Everything's going to be cool.
They don't know.

169
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:42,270
They're trying to build a giant hole in
the ground and they're going to stick

170
00:09:42,271 --> 00:09:47,271
these cones all around it and then freeze
these cones to make a wall of ice so

171
00:09:48,301 --> 00:09:53,301
they have to have all this radioactive
water contained in this fucking enormous,

172
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:59,780
several mile wide containment
area just to try just for water,

173
00:10:00,481 --> 00:10:04,620
just radioactive water that
they're pouring on these
rods to try to cool it off.

174
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:06,530
Again,
I don't know exactly how it felt.

175
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:10,410
This has to affect everything
seafood from that area too. Right.

176
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:14,520
They've already shown a 3% rise in
the radiation of some fish. Really,

177
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:17,470
and that just happened,
I mean this week,

178
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,370
so that takes a while to get to us.

179
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:23,010
It might even not even get
to us for a year or so,

180
00:10:23,011 --> 00:10:24,840
but a year or so they
might be telling you, hey,

181
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:28,920
it's probably not the best idea
to go in the water. That's real.

182
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:33,510
Like you're talking about a massive spill
that doesn't end and it's going to be

183
00:10:33,511 --> 00:10:37,140
like that for hundreds of thousands of
years and I've had people like tweet me

184
00:10:37,141 --> 00:10:38,160
about this and they're like,
wow,

185
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:42,030
it's all diluted and you have to realize
how big the ocean is and you're totally

186
00:10:42,031 --> 00:10:45,570
right. Absolutely. It's pro, I'm
probably looking at it wrong.

187
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:50,730
I'm probably being an alarmist,
but it's never going to stop leaking.

188
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:53,400
Do you get that?
It's never going to stop.

189
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:56,400
What might not be a
horrific catastrophe today?

190
00:10:56,550 --> 00:11:00,630
Could easily be one 50 years from now
if they can ever never get it to stop.

191
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:04,860
Like part of the reason why people aren't
freaking out is because we always have

192
00:11:04,861 --> 00:11:07,790
this optimism about like
human ingenuity is said,

193
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,020
we're going to figure out a way,
right?

194
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,160
We're going to figure out a
way we got to figure out a way.

195
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:14,010
We're not going to figure
out a way with that. Okay.

196
00:11:14,011 --> 00:11:15,660
The nuclear thing is a weird thing.

197
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:19,410
It's weird thing because it does work
most of the time and everybody wants to

198
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,890
stress that like, listen, you're
being an alarmist about nuclear power.

199
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,570
It does work most of the time,

200
00:11:24,571 --> 00:11:28,710
but people have only
been alive for how long?

201
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:31,380
What is the agreement is at a hundred
thousand years or something like that.

202
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,510
Let's say a million in this form,
right?

203
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:38,540
Let's say we've been around a million
years in the last 100 we've made three

204
00:11:38,671 --> 00:11:41,190
spots where you can never go again.

205
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:44,880
As long as they've been
human beings alive.

206
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:49,450
That's how long into the
future it's likely that area
is going to be irradiated.

207
00:11:49,451 --> 00:11:54,430
What are the three Chernobyl
for my island and then this one,

208
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:57,640
Fukushima. Those are, those
are, those three spots are gone.

209
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:01,290
We don't own those spots anymore.
The universe owns those spots. Yeah,

210
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,980
physics on those spots.

211
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:08,160
The insanity of atomic power own those
spots and it's just very weird situation

212
00:12:09,281 --> 00:12:10,540
where nobody wants to admit that.

213
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:15,541
That's a striking number three in the
60 plus years that it's been active,

214
00:12:16,691 --> 00:12:20,980
three places are useless. What is,
what's a thousand years from now?

215
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:25,040
You mean just take the time and do the
math? You can't stop it. You, Mike,

216
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:28,570
unless you come up with some insane new
technology that figures out a way to

217
00:12:28,571 --> 00:12:30,040
contain that radiation,

218
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:33,010
you're always going to deal
with a really bizarre problem.

219
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:35,140
A problem in that if you use it,

220
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:40,500
you make the area around
you unsafe for life forever,

221
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:43,210
for a hundred thousand years mean
what does a hundred thousand years,

222
00:12:43,211 --> 00:12:44,850
you can't even wrap your head around that.
I know.

223
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:48,850
There was no civilization a hundred
thousand years ago and to Zilch, none.

224
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:52,790
Nothing. Everybody agrees. Even Graham
Hancock agrees. All the, the, the,

225
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:56,790
the craziest theorists about
backdating civilization,

226
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:58,870
they all go a hundred
thousand years ago. Oh, Jesus.

227
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:01,510
We were fucking throwing spears,
you know,

228
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:03,490
wooden sticks that we
sharpened at the end.

229
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:05,320
We probably didn't know
how to use fire yet.

230
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,260
Imagined life here a
hundred years ago too.

231
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:09,910
There was no language a
hundred thousand years ago.

232
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:14,140
They think language is 40,000 years
old. Really? Yeah. It was all just,

233
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:19,250
just glancing points and shit and showing
by example and screaming to be some

234
00:13:19,781 --> 00:13:24,780
really successful comics.
I,

235
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:28,840
yeah, it would be like the best
time ever for a lot of comics.

236
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:31,850
No words don't even need the word of

237
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:39,850
that. Um, it's, it's hard to believe
that we're willing to gamble,

238
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:40,990
that we're going to fix that.

239
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:42,470
Do you ever read about how many,

240
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:46,280
I was fascinated by how
many languages go extinct.

241
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:50,420
Like every year there's languages that,
you know,

242
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:53,600
there's obviously like the huge languages
that millions and even billions of

243
00:13:53,601 --> 00:13:54,260
people speak,

244
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:58,640
but then every year there are languages
that they're trying to preserve by

245
00:13:58,641 --> 00:14:00,380
continuing to speak them.
And you know,

246
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:04,970
people learn language just to have it
like an endangered species and then it

247
00:14:04,971 --> 00:14:05,804
just goes away.

248
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:09,570
Yeah. I saw an article recently on the
guy who was like the last guy to know this

249
00:14:09,571 --> 00:14:11,130
language really? And they, yeah,

250
00:14:11,131 --> 00:14:14,640
they had studied this dude and he had
tried to communicate it with them and then

251
00:14:14,641 --> 00:14:16,730
he fucking died. Yeah. That's,
and that's what happened,

252
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:21,190
ms with a lot of the native cultures
or native American tribes that had a

253
00:14:21,191 --> 00:14:24,490
specific language and they're like, they
passed along, passed along, and then,

254
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:28,690
you know, it becomes like not important
or not cool to pass the language.

255
00:14:28,691 --> 00:14:29,740
Like it's not useful.

256
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:33,160
And then it's fewer and fewer people
speak it like they found languages.

257
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,830
I think even in South
America of like Inter,

258
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:40,500
like in the jungles that they thought like
this group and language had, you know,

259
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:45,400
gone whatever extinct forever and
found that there is still living in the

260
00:14:45,401 --> 00:14:46,234
jungles.
Is

261
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:50,240
it, you know, I don't know anything
but English, but you know Spanish,

262
00:14:50,241 --> 00:14:51,980
he speaks Spanish. Yeah. It's

263
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:55,490
pretty well the, Oh, I've seen you talk to
people. Yeah. Pretty. Pretty fluid. Yeah.

264
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,290
Especially to me that
doesn't speak anything.

265
00:14:57,291 --> 00:15:00,950
So how much different are
those two as a language?

266
00:15:00,951 --> 00:15:03,740
Like you have to think differently.
Right? That's what the,

267
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:07,940
that's the reason why like a lot of people
who are from another country and make

268
00:15:07,941 --> 00:15:11,060
the same mistakes over and over again,
whether it's German people,

269
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,730
Brazilian people, a lot of them
make the same kind of mistakes.

270
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:17,350
It's because the whole structure of
sentences is different. It's true. Yeah.

271
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:22,210
Like they're used like in Spanish
you say something like, you know,

272
00:15:22,211 --> 00:15:26,840
you say chocolate milk in English and
there you would say milk of chocolate.

273
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:31,970
Right. That's how you say
that. [inaudible]. So, um, you
say, but so like if you're,

274
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:37,520
if you're trying to literal translations
sometimes the way that you would say it,

275
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:39,670
you have to reconstruct it but it,

276
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:43,730
it comes easier to you if
you're hearing it all the time.

277
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:47,900
Like I used to hear Spanish
every day. I mean, you know,

278
00:15:47,901 --> 00:15:51,740
for the first 18 years of my life
because that's what my mom spoke.

279
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:54,570
So it becomes you,

280
00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:57,880
you realize like the way to say
that it's automated to does it ever,

281
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,740
does it ever fuck with your English?
Did it fuck with your English as a kid?

282
00:16:00,741 --> 00:16:03,170
Like did you like mix up the wrong,

283
00:16:03,171 --> 00:16:07,100
like accidentally use like a Spanish
word for it or accidentally say something

284
00:16:07,101 --> 00:16:09,920
in a way that you would say English,
but he said it in Spanish.

285
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:14,900
I think that came more when I was
learning to speak more. Like for the,

286
00:16:14,901 --> 00:16:19,040
for the longest time my mom spoke Spanish
to us and we just spoke English to her.

287
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:23,390
It was always a deadline.
And she spoke,

288
00:16:23,391 --> 00:16:26,780
I mean she said everything in Spanish
and we were applied completely in English

289
00:16:26,781 --> 00:16:27,840
and she completely understood that.

290
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:31,730
So we completely understood her but are
speaking Spanish wasn't as good and her

291
00:16:31,731 --> 00:16:33,020
speaking English wasn't as good.

292
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:38,380
But then she started with my parents
sent me to spend my summers in Peru and

293
00:16:38,991 --> 00:16:40,880
then that's when it greatly like,

294
00:16:40,881 --> 00:16:44,210
cause you already understand so much
because you were exposed to it and then

295
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:45,530
you're forced to speak it.

296
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:49,490
But when you're forced to speak it
to everybody it gets way better.

297
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:52,660
What did you do in Peru?
I would go to school like I would just,

298
00:16:52,661 --> 00:16:56,720
cause our summers are there
winners. So My, my uh,

299
00:16:56,721 --> 00:17:00,470
I have a ton of cousins and stuff.
I would say with one aunt and an ankle,

300
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:03,830
I came to speak English.
Right. And uncle, I'll go look.

301
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:07,700
And they had three boys that
were like my age basically.

302
00:17:07,701 --> 00:17:12,290
So I would go there, go to school and
just fuck around. I mean we would just,

303
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:17,240
you know, you're just 12, 13, 14 years
old, just, you know, living in Lima.

304
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:22,510
And then they would come to the United
States one by one for their summers to

305
00:17:22,821 --> 00:17:24,950
get better at English. Wow. Yeah.

306
00:17:24,951 --> 00:17:28,160
So we'd take turns at each others they
say that's one of the best ways to

307
00:17:28,161 --> 00:17:30,020
improve your mind. Really. Yeah.

308
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:34,630
The learning other languages and speaking
in other languages. And then also, um,

309
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:39,680
when you start to dream in light in
those languages that yeah, that happens.

310
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:42,870
Yeah, that happened when
I was in college. I just,

311
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:47,690
I went to spend a semester in Spain
and at that point I had already,

312
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:52,900
I already spoke pretty pretty well and
then I started to do like college term

313
00:17:53,551 --> 00:17:56,400
papers in Spanish.
You know where you're writing,

314
00:17:56,470 --> 00:18:01,470
write 20 page papers for a class on
comparative economics and Spanish,

315
00:18:02,221 --> 00:18:05,910
Jesus Christ son.
And then at that point,

316
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:11,030
I mean my Spanish now is not nearly as
good as it was like the year after I left

317
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:16,920
Spain or that I was there and that whole
year after, because it was other level,

318
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:18,600
I dream I was dreaming in Spanish.

319
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:22,140
It was my first thoughts came to
me in Spanish, you know, like,

320
00:18:22,141 --> 00:18:25,290
cause it was just so much and
it's such a high level every day.

321
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:28,440
How long do you think it would take
you if you were immersed in the Spanish

322
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:31,920
culture to start speaking
like that again? I think, um,

323
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:36,570
I think a couple years would
be, I would be, I mean,

324
00:18:36,571 --> 00:18:39,150
I could go and I speak to people now in
Spanish and they asked me what country

325
00:18:39,151 --> 00:18:43,340
I'm from so they get confused.
Say it confuses this weird motherfucker.

326
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,360
Here's the weirdest thing,
and I know it's funny,

327
00:18:45,361 --> 00:18:48,120
like if people who speak Spanish
know exactly what I'm talking about,

328
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:53,580
I don't speak Spanish. I speak Spanish
like a South American and you would,

329
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:57,390
you would know that it's probably
from Colombia or Peru, that area,

330
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,570
because there's very specific little
accent details. Just like here,

331
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:05,250
when someone from New York, from
Boston, from Texas, you know, you, you,

332
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,500
you pick up, it was someone
from Maryland, you know,

333
00:19:07,501 --> 00:19:11,490
someone even like specifically
Baltimore has a very specific accent.

334
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:13,740
So when you speak Spanish,
it's the same deal, right?

335
00:19:13,741 --> 00:19:18,741
You pick up on these little details and
people who are native Spanish speakers,

336
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:22,620
we'll go, oh, are you from
Argentina to me all the time,

337
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:26,460
even though I have nothing
of an Argentine accent,

338
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:29,490
but they do it because
I look like I could,

339
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:33,450
I'm more from Argentina than I am from
Peru. Isn't that interesting? So they're,

340
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:37,680
they're associating what they see and
not what they hear. Well, Argentina is a,

341
00:19:37,681 --> 00:19:42,020
more like Spain was more,
was more like Mexico. Well,

342
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:44,490
like look,
like features wise,

343
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:49,070
there's a way bigger native
Indian population in Peru,

344
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:51,420
Peru weigh more and there's a,

345
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,120
there's a white like
Caucasian population too.

346
00:19:54,121 --> 00:19:57,720
It's just a great minority in Argentina.
It's the opposite.

347
00:19:57,870 --> 00:20:02,640
Did a lot of Nazis go down there and when
the fan fuck yeah, yeah, yeah. Did Right.

348
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:07,020
Yeah. They theirs and the most
famous of all extractions, um,

349
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:11,820
W it's the story of the
House on [inaudible] street
is about, like I say that,

350
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:16,160
yeah.
The Eichmann uh,

351
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:17,600
oh yeah.
I,

352
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:22,670
and moved to when a scientists and he
was living in a house and he had his

353
00:20:23,701 --> 00:20:26,100
family there. Right. His wife, his kids.

354
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:31,780
One of his kids told somebody
in school about like a,

355
00:20:31,781 --> 00:20:36,120
as a secret, told the girl he was
dating about the truth of his family.

356
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:37,510
Oh No.

357
00:20:37,511 --> 00:20:42,300
The girl ratted him out
and what Israel did,

358
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:47,330
which is like considered unacceptable
when you talk about the way that countries

359
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:50,970
interact with Gordon international
standards and you know,

360
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:55,090
treaties and the way that we all have
kind of a diplomatic process that we go

361
00:20:55,091 --> 00:20:59,830
about. His Day came in and Jason
Bourne style took that motherfucker,

362
00:20:59,831 --> 00:21:02,980
kidnapped him, flew him back to
Israel and was like, we got this guy.

363
00:21:02,981 --> 00:21:05,500
And they were like, wow, like
that kind of Shit, you know,

364
00:21:05,501 --> 00:21:09,790
instead of trying to go about, hey,
we want to go for a whole extradition,

365
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:13,900
they came in, snagged him,
brought him back. Yeah. The,

366
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,770
the Israelis don't play. Fuck no, no,

367
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:18,570
they don't play when it
comes to that shit either.

368
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:21,580
Some girl at a,
I mean it's kind of a fucked up story,

369
00:21:21,581 --> 00:21:25,640
but some girl was a photographer
and she had gone to uh,

370
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:30,130
the West Bank and she took some
photographs and when she was going through

371
00:21:30,131 --> 00:21:34,210
Israeli customs, some of the photographs
were like of spray paint graffiti.

372
00:21:34,211 --> 00:21:36,760
And one of them said like,
fuck the Jews who shit.

373
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:40,900
So the dude puts her laptop down the
ground, he goes, I'll be right back.

374
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:45,850
He takes a gun, comes back and
shoots the fucking laptop. Wow.

375
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:49,810
Shot Laptop and gave it back to
her, the bullet hole in it. Wow.

376
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:55,930
And she was like, what the fuck? I'm
a photographer. I saw this. I took,

377
00:21:56,010 --> 00:22:00,970
it's taking pictures of chaos.
You know, she's a Jew by the way.

378
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,700
She's a Jew. Yes. She was a Jew. Jesus.

379
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:09,310
They don't fucking play man. Fuck the
Jews. Okay, well there's nothing clearly.

380
00:22:09,311 --> 00:22:12,550
There's no explaining it either. Like now
here's the thing like that. Like, Nah,

381
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:17,470
they just took it over. Doom, doom, doom.
That's like a, the guy handed it to her.

382
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:21,790
Did you see that guy do that
online? But the dad, what did he do?

383
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:25,390
His daughter has nothing to do
with like racism or anything,

384
00:22:25,391 --> 00:22:30,391
but his daughter was complaining about
her parents on Facebook and like fucking

385
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:32,250
these chores.
They think I'm like,

386
00:22:32,251 --> 00:22:35,260
are their slave like telling me
I have to do all these chores?

387
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:39,670
So the guy is like, I've been, she
had her, her Facebook page locked.

388
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,230
So like her family couldn't see it.

389
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:43,810
Well her dad's like a
software guy and he was like,

390
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:47,230
you forgot like what I do for a living.
Right. He made a video. He's like,

391
00:22:47,231 --> 00:22:50,510
so I saw what you said.
So what you think we mistreat you?

392
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:53,310
You're a slave in this house.
Okay, well here's your laptop.

393
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:56,410
I just spent a few hundred dollars
upgrading it and he puts on the ground.

394
00:22:56,411 --> 00:23:00,550
He just, he empties like a 45
into it. Oh my God. He's like,

395
00:23:00,551 --> 00:23:03,700
I'm gonna put this on your Facebook page
so all your friends can see this shit.

396
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,790
Like extreme. Yeah. But he was like,

397
00:23:06,791 --> 00:23:10,900
daddy don't play Holy Shit.
He shot it and no,

398
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:14,680
he just shot it in the videos that she
would see it on her Facebook page. Oh,

399
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:17,230
like her laptop when she got
home from school. I got confused.

400
00:23:17,231 --> 00:23:19,760
I thought he was doing it in front of her.
No, no, no, no, no, no. He did it like,

401
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:23,320
like as a, you know, a
message to her that she did.

402
00:23:23,321 --> 00:23:26,040
So she would go online later
and see that on her own.

403
00:23:26,041 --> 00:23:30,120
That on her own Facebook page.
Yeah. This is, yeah. Yeah.

404
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:33,910
Oh, you know what, man, first of all,
I don't think this guy understands.

405
00:23:33,911 --> 00:23:36,070
He's putting his daughter
out there like that. Naming

406
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:38,920
her. It's humiliating. It's,
it's a douchey thing to do. It's,

407
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:40,330
you're raising a human being.

408
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:43,300
You don't do that in front of the
whole fucking world by shaming them.

409
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:46,130
Humiliation has a pretty profound effect.
Does

410
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:50,720
man, and it's intense and so unnecessary.
The guy's a father, you know,

411
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:55,540
that said, it's pretty funny.
I mean, I don't recommend it,

412
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:59,270
but if you do it, I'll watch the video.
Uh, it's probably as a shithead though.

413
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:03,370
He's a shithead. Um, but I imagine
that she stopped posting. She's like,

414
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:08,210
might not even know he's a shithead,
you know, because part of raising a kid,

415
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:11,990
I don't want to sound like Doctor Oz,
but part of raising a kid is

416
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:16,150
shooting the laptop.

417
00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:20,770
One, two, three, four, five,
six. Oh yeah. After that
comment you made about your mom,

418
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,990
your mom told me to be sure I
put one in there for her. So

419
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:28,160
dance from her fucked up. Shit.
That's rednecks with guns.

420
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:32,560
No ma'am. All right. Wow.

421
00:24:33,730 --> 00:24:38,420
Disturbing. That guy's a knucklehead.
That guy's a serious knucklehead.

422
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,850
He might not even know he's a knucklehead.

423
00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:43,450
People think that when you're raising
a child that you're supposed to,

424
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:46,870
you know that somehow or another,

425
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:50,670
their development isn't your
responsibility. You know,

426
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:52,660
they just want you to grow up on your own.

427
00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:57,310
They don't want to sort of guide you
along the way and explain in a, in a nice,

428
00:24:57,311 --> 00:25:00,430
healthy way. Yeah, why what
you're doing is incorrect.

429
00:25:00,431 --> 00:25:04,900
And here's where we're really coming
from. You know, and people just work.

430
00:25:04,930 --> 00:25:07,900
They work and they leave their kids
alone and then when they get home,

431
00:25:07,901 --> 00:25:08,351
they're tired.

432
00:25:08,351 --> 00:25:11,620
They stick them in front of the TV and
then they wonder why this girl is ranting

433
00:25:11,621 --> 00:25:13,090
and raving and saying stupid shit.

434
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:16,240
A lot of the reason why kids say stupid
shit is just because they're getting

435
00:25:16,241 --> 00:25:18,040
older.
They're getting a mind of their own.

436
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:21,620
They think they got it all
figured out yet or now. But Bob,

437
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:25,510
a lot of it is also because they're being
raised by morons that shoot computers

438
00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:28,120
and what effect is the computer shooting?

439
00:25:28,121 --> 00:25:32,380
Really going to have long guy's a moron.
Moron. Move. She's going to have a gun.

440
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,930
You know, like she's going to think that
you could, you could just shoot laptop.

441
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:37,930
She might shoot him. Man,
that guy's a dick. That's,

442
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,820
that's a dick move to not just do that,

443
00:25:39,821 --> 00:25:42,610
to do that to dick move to put
it on her fucking Facebook.

444
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:44,530
That's a super dick move.

445
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:45,121
Yeah.

446
00:25:45,121 --> 00:25:50,121
Or she might learn that like the way to
handle like somebody's upsetting you is

447
00:25:51,091 --> 00:25:52,470
to shoot their shit to

448
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:56,280
my daddy told me not to take no guff.

449
00:25:57,090 --> 00:26:00,930
My Daddy told me how to get back
on a mother fucker. A 45 yeah,

450
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:05,280
I'll shoot your fucking football bap, bap,
Bap out light shit up. And you're like,

451
00:26:05,281 --> 00:26:09,090
wow, you were kind of the wrong chick
from me. Those wild redneck pitches.

452
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:12,200
It was West Virginia girl.

453
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:20,790
You see that the wild. That's
right. You gave me that.

454
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:24,960
My favorite part of that whole movie
is a like one of the, I don't know,

455
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:29,820
one of the fucking absolute disasters
of that family is like this right here.

456
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:31,253
She's like,

457
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:35,100
I got these Xanax gone for like six
bucks a piece roll down the street.

458
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:38,220
So for eight bucks a piece, a little
boot scoot and boogie right there.

459
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:41,490
Like make some money like this.
You're selling it for $2 more.

460
00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:43,043
Well that's all you can

461
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:49,100
cash today. That's how we do
it. We got 16 bucks now. Bit.

462
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:52,800
Yeah, there's not much,
there's not much room there.

463
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:56,610
That's just incredible.
Plus if you go to jail,

464
00:26:56,611 --> 00:27:00,810
like all your profits are going to get
eaten up by an attorney of court fees.

465
00:27:00,811 --> 00:27:03,170
You gotta be able to work. But they
never had a word cause it never works.

466
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:06,720
Which is hilarious. Best part. Yeah.
When they talked to the politician,

467
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:09,300
if you the w the wild and
wonderful whites of West Virginia,

468
00:27:09,301 --> 00:27:11,140
I believe Johnny Knoxville,
um,

469
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:14,760
directed it or producer or something
along spam is a company I think produced

470
00:27:14,761 --> 00:27:19,620
that movie. Yeah. And he just was
embedded who was embedded in their,

471
00:27:19,621 --> 00:27:20,520
their lifestyle.

472
00:27:20,521 --> 00:27:24,930
And you've got a chance to see them like
for real legit 100% where they are and

473
00:27:24,931 --> 00:27:28,260
they're awesome. And people
looked at it so depressing. No,

474
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:32,610
you can decide it's suppressing. Well,
you can decide. It's like a human zoo.

475
00:27:32,611 --> 00:27:36,930
That's awesome. Yeah.
It's like there's a point,

476
00:27:36,931 --> 00:27:41,520
you're watching that movie and you go,
there's no way it can contain.

477
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:44,820
Like there's no way. There's another
character after this and just family.

478
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:49,890
And that's about 10 minutes in
and they just,

479
00:27:49,891 --> 00:27:53,760
and then like an hour and you're like,
you've gotta be shitting me right now.

480
00:27:53,761 --> 00:27:56,730
And the next guy, and then I shot
him in this chest and you're like,

481
00:27:57,060 --> 00:28:00,540
what the fuck? How about that one
dude who had escaped the state?

482
00:28:00,810 --> 00:28:03,750
He moved up to Minnesota.
He has family sitting there.

483
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:06,840
They're all sitting around drinking. Go,
man, they're just too fucking crazy. Yeah.

484
00:28:06,841 --> 00:28:11,400
He had to fucking crazy. He does
not belong. Like that's, that's,

485
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:14,550
that's good that he left.
He's the guy with a job and a family.

486
00:28:14,551 --> 00:28:17,910
Like he looked at all of our sponsors,
this whole, in that family, they're like,

487
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:23,050
he's a fucking asshole because he
got his shit together and left. Yeah.

488
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:25,870
He's a fucking lit. He, um,
he won't sell out. Yeah.

489
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:30,510
You ain't go out and work for your money.

490
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:34,680
But he had a story to, it was, he had
done at least one or two crazy things,

491
00:28:34,681 --> 00:28:38,350
I think. Right. Like you did at
least one crazy shit. Yeah. Yeah.

492
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:42,090
If you don't believe that this movie is
[inaudible] think we're exaggerating,

493
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:46,500
you just kind of hear this
woman Bobby sue talk. Oh.

494
00:28:46,770 --> 00:28:47,341
If you see,

495
00:28:47,341 --> 00:28:51,780
if you can find Bobby sue
from wild and wonderful west,

496
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:55,170
it's Bobby sue. Right?
Wasn't there Bob Sue Bob to,

497
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:58,880
my name's sue Bob. I
call him. I'm the sacs.

498
00:28:58,881 --> 00:29:03,150
He might in the family
and she's being serious.

499
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:07,110
They're all kind of sexy and it
kind of a crazy way. A little bit.

500
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,350
It probably be the one you'd
want a little Mug, a moonshine.

501
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:11,910
If those are your options.

502
00:29:11,911 --> 00:29:15,060
I think you wouldn't do if you were
living up there and that was your life and

503
00:29:15,061 --> 00:29:19,020
you're selling pills for two bucks over
for a living and the Supai Blah wants to

504
00:29:19,021 --> 00:29:23,720
throw down you like, oh, on,
let me put the possum away.

505
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:25,260
Uh,
yeah,

506
00:29:25,261 --> 00:29:29,120
they're fucking epic disasters and no,

507
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:32,160
I don't wish they were like this.
Absolutely.

508
00:29:32,161 --> 00:29:36,600
I wished that they were a really nice
people who are normal. Oh, that's,

509
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:39,570
that's not the one.
There it is.

510
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:42,100
I take those out

511
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:46,110
and that's what made the band Kansas.
Somebody I brought it home nice.

512
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:49,980
15 to $2,000 a night.
And uh,

513
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:55,120
I've always been effect as well in the
family violence that Tom has thousands of

514
00:29:55,121 --> 00:29:55,954
paper.

515
00:29:57,900 --> 00:30:00,100
Ooh,
you gotta do what you gotta do.

516
00:30:00,101 --> 00:30:03,910
If you're trapped in West Virginia and
you're on a horse and there's no way out,

517
00:30:04,530 --> 00:30:09,310
you got to do what you gotta do. A
Bose be the is. What about Fab Jesus?

518
00:30:09,311 --> 00:30:12,940
She looked like a female version of
whirlpool champion. Johnny Archer.

519
00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:19,330
Is he the sexiest one in pool? Yes. Yeah.
And she's the sexiest one in the family.

520
00:30:19,331 --> 00:30:23,610
Yeah. Don't hate it. Just
is what it is, man. Yeah.
[inaudible] always been the sax.

521
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:25,780
You're just wanting,
her voice is like, it's,

522
00:30:25,781 --> 00:30:30,781
it's makes you wonder if life is real
because it makes you wonder if like when

523
00:30:30,851 --> 00:30:35,800
you see that or you see a
grizzly man or yeah, any of this.

524
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:38,920
It makes you wonder, man,
that club also lets you know,

525
00:30:38,921 --> 00:30:42,230
it makes you wonder if life can affect
your voice. You know what I mean? Like,

526
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:46,600
yeah. But I mean like that has,
imagine the impact that's had.

527
00:30:46,810 --> 00:30:51,190
Her voice was not always like that. No, it
couldn't have been right. No Way. No Way.

528
00:30:51,191 --> 00:30:54,670
Man. That is a long, that's
a lot of sleepless nights.

529
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,690
That's a lot of being up till 5:00 AM.
That's,

530
00:30:58,060 --> 00:31:00,880
that's two middle like Tupac pill.

531
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:05,290
Just that'd be hard living hard
living about, don't be scared.

532
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:06,820
Don't be scared.

533
00:31:06,821 --> 00:31:10,510
Pussy don't act like you don't think
I'm San one sounds like a pussy.

534
00:31:10,511 --> 00:31:13,990
And then there's the mom who
runs everything that mom has,

535
00:31:13,991 --> 00:31:18,730
bad ass mag. It's her. She's the
one dealing, what was her name?

536
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:20,410
Fuck,
I don't remember man.

537
00:31:20,650 --> 00:31:25,150
I don't remember saying that was so
God damn good movie and yeah, I agree.

538
00:31:25,151 --> 00:31:27,910
It's depressing but it is. It's
out there. It is what it is.

539
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:31,780
I always talk about Stevie. You saw
Stevie, Stevie, them documentary? No.

540
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:36,820
What's that? It's super, it's
hilarious. But it's also like there's,

541
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:40,480
people are like, this is a
bummer. I'm like, it's still
hysterical. It's an about,

542
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:45,690
it follows this Guy Stevie
who the filmmaker actually
was like a big brother to

543
00:31:47,171 --> 00:31:50,770
him and like the big brother program or
something and it goes back and revisit

544
00:31:50,771 --> 00:31:53,830
him like 20 years later and he is like,

545
00:31:53,831 --> 00:31:58,510
he belongs in the whites, West
Virginia family. You know,

546
00:31:58,511 --> 00:32:02,390
he's one of those guys and like he gets,
it's,

547
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:07,300
he's fucking retarded. I mean there's no
other like, do you have a Stevie clip?

548
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:11,150
This is the only thing that I've
came up with Stevie. Oh really?

549
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:15,340
That's definitely, this is not acting.
You checking them out of real? No, no, no.

550
00:32:15,341 --> 00:32:17,680
It's the same guy that made hoop dreams.
Did you ever see hoop dreams?

551
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:21,300
It's a really good document either.
It's a really good documentary. Yeah,

552
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:25,070
I heard it was really good. Fantastic. So
many films and I never get too, man. Yeah.

553
00:32:25,090 --> 00:32:26,320
Oh, me too. You have the time.

554
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:29,410
I'm like Mary doses to them
and then I don't really even,

555
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:34,060
there's so many out there that is so
good. This it, this. Let's see. Very good.

556
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:37,840
Solitary, not involved with
other people a whole lot.

557
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:40,250
I

558
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:44,360
Stevie neglected. That's
kind of the, the ammo.

559
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:49,420
There's somebody who molests kids
areas.

560
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:53,930
You've got to look at it really cold
started looking on the human individuals

561
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:57,470
and while, yeah, this, he's
really not that bad guy. Well,

562
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:58,760
why don't you look at the victim.

563
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:02,810
The victim is wasn't that bad
of a person either. I mean,

564
00:33:02,811 --> 00:33:07,700
you've given him chances in the past
and now he's got himself in a load of

565
00:33:07,701 --> 00:33:10,910
trouble and you give them another chance.

566
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:14,540
That guy's a smooth talker.

567
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:17,133
Yeah.

568
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:22,000
So do you think Steve's innocent? No.
Cause he said, he told me what he did do,

569
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,313
but I mean,
he's going to,

570
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:28,340
he's already sitting up with that
kept being added. Sister's daughter.

571
00:33:28,670 --> 00:33:29,503
His niece.

572
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:34,950
Yeah. Oh Jesus, they might call you
as a witness if this goes to trial.

573
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,760
You know,
this isn't the funniest click actually

574
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,560
floodings in Japan.

575
00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:46,660
The thing when I talk about the funny
stuff in this movie before you think I'm

576
00:33:46,661 --> 00:33:50,800
insane, it's because of like
the little things like you know,

577
00:33:50,801 --> 00:33:53,110
before it all goes down like he's,
he's like,

578
00:33:53,111 --> 00:33:55,180
they call me snake cause I
ain't afraid of them. You know,

579
00:33:55,181 --> 00:33:57,500
they always call me snake glasses.
Yeah.

580
00:33:57,670 --> 00:34:00,160
Stevie and you're like no one will
know everything went down. You know,

581
00:34:00,161 --> 00:34:03,430
before it gets like create like before
he gets arrested and stuff and they're

582
00:34:03,431 --> 00:34:03,710
just

583
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:07,430
following him around and
like is that him on the left

584
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:10,180
wearing a tie dye shirt? Yes. Yes.

585
00:34:10,181 --> 00:34:12,700
And that's the kind of the Shit I'm
saying that you laugh at like you just,

586
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:13,910
so that's where he's over here.

587
00:34:13,911 --> 00:34:16,850
Go ahead and get it here
while your sister's discount.

588
00:34:19,010 --> 00:34:22,930
He's just a fucking milk and we didn't
get it. Idiot. You know, I don't all,

589
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:27,780
oh man. Who the fuck would leave that guy
alone with your kid? Yeah, it's a great,

590
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:32,520
great question. What a piece
of shit. Piece of shit.

591
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:34,950
Pieces of shit that molest
kids, man. That's it.

592
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:38,310
That's us real special piece of
shit. It's like, yeah, oh yeah,

593
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:40,710
that's the recidivism rate is so high.

594
00:34:40,890 --> 00:34:44,850
The amount of fucked up in this you have
to have going on to do that is so high.

595
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:48,450
That's a really bad one.
That's when it's really hard to forgive.

596
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:53,580
And that's that too is like, um,
you know, even when they, um,

597
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:58,170
given to like
acknowledging what they did wrong.

598
00:34:58,770 --> 00:35:02,010
If you give them the space to justify it,
they will.

599
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:03,750
Did you hear this Dawkins quote,

600
00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:08,520
Dawkins gotten a lot of trouble for
talking about mild pedophilia? No,

601
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:12,460
she was really weird, man.
What he's saying. Um, hold on,

602
00:35:13,210 --> 00:35:17,730
I'll find it for you. Um, he, uh, he said
that there's, if as long as it's not,

603
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:22,920
it's just a mild touching
up that your psychology,

604
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:27,570
um, uh, would, uh, would erase it here.

605
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:30,480
Let me remark. Provokes
outrage. Yeah. He's like,

606
00:35:30,481 --> 00:35:35,310
your mind would protect you from it as
long as it was just mild touching up.

607
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:40,020
You know, it's really weird. The,
the, the quote is really weird.

608
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:45,110
He says that he experienced mild
pedophilia in English school when he was a

609
00:35:45,151 --> 00:35:50,100
child in the 1950s referring to his early
days at boarding school in Salisbury.

610
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:55,250
He recalled how one of the unnamed
masters pulled me on his knee and put his

611
00:35:55,321 --> 00:35:56,610
hand inside my shorts.

612
00:35:57,060 --> 00:36:00,750
He said other children in his school
peer group had been molested by the same

613
00:36:00,751 --> 00:36:02,100
teacher,
but concluded.

614
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:07,080
I didn't think he did any of
us lasting harm. I'm very,

615
00:36:07,081 --> 00:36:11,490
I'm very conscious that you can't
condemn people of an earlier era by the

616
00:36:11,491 --> 00:36:12,540
standards of ours.

617
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:17,100
Just as we don't look back at the 18th
and 19th centuries and condemn people for

618
00:36:17,101 --> 00:36:20,250
racism and the same way we would
condemn a modern person for racism.

619
00:36:20,850 --> 00:36:24,840
I look back a few decades into my
childhood and I see things like canning,

620
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:29,870
like mild pedophilia and can't find it
in me to condemn it by the same standards

621
00:36:29,881 --> 00:36:33,360
as I or anyone would today.
He said, that's interesting.

622
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:36,430
I think that's kind of a it,
you know,

623
00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:40,620
it's very brave of him to say
because it's very, it's very, uh,

624
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:42,600
controversial obviously. Yeah. I mean,

625
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:47,070
I don't totally disagree with him as far
as holding people to different eras of

626
00:36:47,071 --> 00:36:48,430
different standards.
Yes.

627
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:53,240
I don't think that he should be the one
necessarily to comment on how that might

628
00:36:53,241 --> 00:36:56,010
have affected some of his classmates
though. Right. When he says like,

629
00:36:56,011 --> 00:37:00,150
I don't think any of us were really,
um, too effected by that. I mean,

630
00:37:00,151 --> 00:37:03,390
you don't know that some of those guys
might have been completely traumatized,

631
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:04,771
you know,

632
00:37:04,771 --> 00:37:07,500
quite honestly some people would say
that he's been damaged by and he just

633
00:37:07,501 --> 00:37:09,750
doesn't realize it.
Absolutely. That, you know,

634
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:13,770
maybe that would make sense for why,
you know,

635
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:16,620
he's gotten into some, some of the
situations that he's gotten into.

636
00:37:16,621 --> 00:37:19,200
Some of the things that he said in the
past that had been fairly controversial.

637
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:22,740
Sure. Maybe it was about this,
um, you know, but anyhow,

638
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:27,450
but people think it's like super
irresponsible. That's the, the main rub.

639
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,550
Anybody to go out there and say,
oh,

640
00:37:29,551 --> 00:37:33,450
it's not that big a deal for a little
mild pedophilia projecting. Well, yeah.

641
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,860
And not, well, not only that,

642
00:37:34,861 --> 00:37:39,861
but it also could almost encourage mild
pedophilia as being nothing of course.

643
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:43,860
And then, you know, you could go back
to like what I was saying, where he,

644
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:48,660
the guy that is doing this then
justify, he's like, I'm not really like,

645
00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:51,210
it's so minor. I'm just,
you know, right now,

646
00:37:51,211 --> 00:37:55,620
clearly he's saying that this is
a different era than he's calm.

647
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:59,610
He's talking about a different era and
that we can't judge the people of that

648
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:00,720
era today.

649
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:06,080
But he's still talking about it as if
there's like a mechanism to protect you

650
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:10,430
right from this kind of, I'm going to
sneeze. Sorry. Okay. I felt a code.

651
00:38:13,370 --> 00:38:17,720
That's you man that was, you know,
happen clean my nose hairs out. Yeah.

652
00:38:17,910 --> 00:38:21,000
I got a little nose hair
trimmer and sometimes they
get some strays up there and

653
00:38:21,001 --> 00:38:23,550
you just can't resist those sneezes
when they're coming. They're, oh yeah.

654
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:25,800
Do you get, you get that from like, no,

655
00:38:25,801 --> 00:38:29,410
but when I look at light it'll make me
sneeze. What I'm saying. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

656
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:33,570
I knew it was coming and I just stare at
the light percentage of the population

657
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:38,530
does that really? And like, it's
called a light induced. Amazing. Yeah.

658
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:41,560
Oh, that's interesting. So like
I'm one of those two where like,

659
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:44,590
and I've told people like that
about it and like, and they're like,

660
00:38:44,591 --> 00:38:47,050
what the fuck are you talking about?
And they have no like,

661
00:38:47,051 --> 00:38:48,430
you have never done that.
Never heard of that.

662
00:38:48,650 --> 00:38:52,000
Because if I would be outside I would
just be sneezing all like crazy, you know?

663
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,380
But look it up. Like look up like sunlight
induced or lightened, do sneezing.

664
00:38:56,381 --> 00:39:01,300
You'll see that like it's a,
you're like that too. Yeah. Yeah.

665
00:39:01,370 --> 00:39:03,670
If you walk out of like a movie theater,
you got off shit.

666
00:39:03,671 --> 00:39:08,110
And like just if I go crate, yeah.
Every time. So what people are saying,

667
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:10,210
people were really pissed
at him and this guy,

668
00:39:10,211 --> 00:39:15,211
his name's Peter Wad is director of
the child protection and then of the

669
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:17,290
National Society for the
prevention of cruelty to children.

670
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:21,490
He said Dawkins remarks were a terrible
slight on those who have been abused and

671
00:39:21,491 --> 00:39:23,080
suffer the effects for decades.

672
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:26,500
Mr Docken seems to think that because
a crime was committed a long time ago,

673
00:39:26,501 --> 00:39:28,960
we should judge it in a different way.
Watts said,

674
00:39:28,961 --> 00:39:31,810
we know that victims of sexual
abuse suffer the same effects,

675
00:39:31,811 --> 00:39:35,860
whether it was 50 years ago or
today. Yeah. He's uh, probably,

676
00:39:36,490 --> 00:39:38,650
you know, correct. I mean, the,

677
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:42,490
the thing that you have to examine is
like Dawkins statement and you have to

678
00:39:42,491 --> 00:39:45,640
think, you consider it case
by case. So I don't mean,

679
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:47,500
I don't mean pedophilia case by case.

680
00:39:47,501 --> 00:39:52,180
I mean like the whole idea about judging
people based on an era like, you know,

681
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:55,600
to, to a degree you kind of
go, well, in a certain era,

682
00:39:55,601 --> 00:39:59,040
certain certain point of
views we're allowed, you know?

683
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:03,960
But I don't know that that
really applies to pedophilia.

684
00:40:04,270 --> 00:40:09,130
Yeah. It doesn't, it seems like that's
always been a really dark thing to do.

685
00:40:09,131 --> 00:40:14,131
But what's really fucked up is when
you go way back to like the classics.

686
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:18,070
Like if you go back to you, you
know, like Socrates was gay,

687
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:20,950
there was a lot of guys back
then that were not just gay,

688
00:40:20,951 --> 00:40:23,150
but took on young boys is letters.
Right.

689
00:40:23,470 --> 00:40:26,770
That was a very common amongst the
Samurai Samurai took on young boys,

690
00:40:26,771 --> 00:40:28,630
his lovers. That applies
to what he's saying. Right.

691
00:40:28,631 --> 00:40:33,400
Your examples are our people in now
this happens to be much long time ago,

692
00:40:33,401 --> 00:40:36,820
but it's, well it's very,
it's, it's, you know,

693
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:41,020
it's very different when a person
who's alive today in the context of our

694
00:40:41,021 --> 00:40:45,130
society right now speaks about pedophilia
as if it's not that big a deal when it

695
00:40:45,131 --> 00:40:46,130
happened to him.
Yeah.

696
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:51,420
And someone talking about like
almost an imperceptible difference.

697
00:40:52,210 --> 00:40:53,300
I mean not,
not imperceptible,

698
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:58,000
but inconceivable difference between
the way the culture of Japan in the 12th

699
00:40:58,001 --> 00:41:01,920
century was and the culture of
the United States and you know,

700
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:05,690
2013 I mean they're not even the
same planet. Right. It's so hard to,

701
00:41:05,950 --> 00:41:09,580
you're dealing with a Japanese,
they have a completely different language,

702
00:41:09,581 --> 00:41:13,090
different culture. And there,
this is a long, long, long, long,

703
00:41:13,091 --> 00:41:14,980
long fucking time ago
when people couldn't even,

704
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:18,310
it took a long time to get anywhere,
get by boat or by horse.

705
00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:21,850
But for the most part people fucking
stood still and they developed their own

706
00:41:21,851 --> 00:41:25,030
culture sort of a way from
the rest of the world.

707
00:41:25,031 --> 00:41:28,450
And it's one of the more fascinating
aspects about it. But when you look back,

708
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:33,160
what is the common theme? The common
theme in almost all these cultures,

709
00:41:33,350 --> 00:41:36,920
gay sex,
gay sex and pedophilia.

710
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:41,030
Like they did it throughout
Rome, throughout the Greeks, the,

711
00:41:41,130 --> 00:41:45,840
all the Spartans were gay.
Samurais like there was so much gay sex,

712
00:41:45,841 --> 00:41:48,020
like our idea of what?

713
00:41:48,170 --> 00:41:52,670
Like sex is in 2013 like we think that,
oh,

714
00:41:52,671 --> 00:41:54,970
back then you know if he
got locked up in prison,

715
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:57,590
you had a a dude like no big deal. No, no.

716
00:41:57,591 --> 00:42:00,080
They were banging each other and
they were banging everybody. Yeah.

717
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:04,230
I want to know when people like settle
down and stop just fucking guys. Oh,

718
00:42:04,231 --> 00:42:09,110
there was no, there was no judgment
about that, of that was like, hey man,

719
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:10,970
dicks hard. You've got
an asshole. Let's do it.

720
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:14,100
What's almost like it was too hard to
get laid back then. Yeah. You know,

721
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:16,370
and like sometimes you just
had to do what you had to do.

722
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:18,950
I got to imagine that if
you go back far enough,

723
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:22,070
a lot of sexual behavior went unchecked.
It was just,

724
00:42:22,071 --> 00:42:25,790
you were just an acting on it and
went into whatever sex act you wanted,

725
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:27,970
desired that like you're,

726
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:33,300
you're fucking monkey brain was dictating
and you didn't really think about how,

727
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:36,560
you know, like the way that
you're a culture looked upon it.

728
00:42:36,561 --> 00:42:40,340
People just did stuff. Right. And
then that was it. There was no,

729
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:42,680
I'm going to talk to somebody
about you made me uncomfortable.

730
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:47,090
Like you just did whatever you
wanted to do and there's no,

731
00:42:47,091 --> 00:42:50,030
there's no HR back then that way,

732
00:42:50,031 --> 00:42:53,780
like unchecked civilization like
that clearly is a different form of

733
00:42:53,781 --> 00:42:57,620
civilization. It's different world.
It's wild, wild west type shit. Oh yeah.

734
00:42:58,170 --> 00:43:02,450
To the fucking umpteenth power though
when you talk about hundreds of years ago.

735
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:06,860
Oh yeah. Well when you get
really, um, Viking Shit and, or,

736
00:43:06,890 --> 00:43:09,430
or the all of ancient Europe.
Yeah.

737
00:43:09,650 --> 00:43:13,380
If you ever heard a lady battery ever
heard of this fucking evil bitch and

738
00:43:13,390 --> 00:43:16,390
Elisabeth Bathory, she was a, a,

739
00:43:16,470 --> 00:43:21,470
a royalty and a 1560 in Hungarian
Hungary and this bitch killed like,

740
00:43:25,371 --> 00:43:29,090
they don't even know how many women
she started getting. As she got older,

741
00:43:29,091 --> 00:43:32,320
she started killing younger women.
She didn't want them around. Yeah,

742
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,880
I'm pretty sure she would
cut them up and torture them.

743
00:43:34,970 --> 00:43:38,270
Kill and she killed hundreds of them.

744
00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:43,070
Hundreds pretty bitch. And they
didn't even kill her when it was over.

745
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:47,000
They convicted her and put
her in like a room for life.

746
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:51,200
They just locked her in
this room. Hungarian. Yeah.
Well she was royalty. Yeah.

747
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:54,710
So because of the fact that
she was royalty, they just
decided not to kill her.

748
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:58,340
Yeah. The, the, the level of
brutality when you go back for it,

749
00:43:58,341 --> 00:44:01,850
like you have ever read about
of Lod the impaler. Yes.

750
00:44:01,910 --> 00:44:06,910
I mean he would impale enemies and
people in his camp who didn't like who he

751
00:44:08,841 --> 00:44:13,841
heard spoke against him and to impale
them and he would do it and sometimes when

752
00:44:13,851 --> 00:44:15,470
you were impaled, you know, they could,

753
00:44:15,530 --> 00:44:18,950
it could go right through a vital
artery or Oregon and you'll die.

754
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:21,980
But there's a lot of times
when you can get impaled.

755
00:44:22,430 --> 00:44:27,430
It can literally miss every vital
artery in Oregon and you bleed out,

756
00:44:27,591 --> 00:44:31,710
impaled just in the sun for a day.

757
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:33,330
Holy Shit.
With,

758
00:44:33,410 --> 00:44:38,310
with a fucking wooden rod up through
your ass hole going through your body and

759
00:44:38,311 --> 00:44:41,310
coming out like your shoulder or
mouth and you're just bleeding.

760
00:44:41,310 --> 00:44:43,920
I mean it's a pretty gruesome way to go.
Oh my God.

761
00:44:43,921 --> 00:44:48,000
There was something about a bad set.
Hmm. There was, I think it was in Persia.

762
00:44:49,410 --> 00:44:53,790
A stake in Persia. Hold on. Did
you see this picture of what story?

763
00:44:54,610 --> 00:44:58,860
There's a story about
these, uh, people, uh,

764
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:03,980
back in the Roman days where there was
like miles of bodies on steaks to warn

765
00:45:06,271 --> 00:45:10,410
people as they approached.
So as these people approached,

766
00:45:10,770 --> 00:45:15,330
I need to find the exact story,
but as these people approached a,

767
00:45:15,331 --> 00:45:17,580
I guess it would, there was a
pro, they were approaching Persia.

768
00:45:17,730 --> 00:45:22,730
They had miles of bodies
on steaks to let you know,

769
00:45:22,801 --> 00:45:25,800
like you're coming here and trying to
fuck with us cause this is what we're

770
00:45:25,801 --> 00:45:26,650
going to do to you.
Yeah.

771
00:45:26,770 --> 00:45:30,060
And you'd get that stanch about five
miles before you saw it. You know,

772
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:34,130
he'd be like, what is that smell man?
But just the idea that I was around,

773
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:35,220
people would do that,

774
00:45:35,221 --> 00:45:39,810
that they would just run rows
and rows and rows of bodies.

775
00:45:39,811 --> 00:45:44,811
Do you think that that the only reason
that doesn't go on today is because

776
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:50,240
there's like that morally checking
thing or because that would suggest that

777
00:45:50,761 --> 00:45:55,610
there's like way more either acceptance
of that behavior or there's just like,

778
00:45:56,020 --> 00:46:00,180
er, like crazier sociopath just
running shit all the time, you know?

779
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:05,130
Well, I think that's a probably are
today. I think it's, it's, it's way they,

780
00:46:05,190 --> 00:46:09,510
they're way better at like hiding the
more fucked up things that people do today

781
00:46:09,670 --> 00:46:12,930
that would be like way out
in the open. Yeah. You know,

782
00:46:12,931 --> 00:46:17,931
like it's this situation that's going
on right now in Syria where everybody's

783
00:46:18,330 --> 00:46:20,190
saying that this is the
most important thing,

784
00:46:20,191 --> 00:46:23,700
that we have to step up and we have to
go and we have to attack Syria because

785
00:46:23,701 --> 00:46:25,620
Syria has done this thing and,
and these,

786
00:46:25,890 --> 00:46:29,880
these people have have died and
these innocence or being poisoned.

787
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:35,660
There's no mention whatsoever
in the mainstream news of
the irony of the guy who

788
00:46:36,571 --> 00:46:40,780
is the head of the United States military.

789
00:46:40,781 --> 00:46:44,490
The commander in chief talking
about innocent people dying, right?

790
00:46:44,580 --> 00:46:46,360
I mean it's Kinda crazy, right? Oh yeah.

791
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:50,280
It's like this idea that there's a certain
amount of innocent people that must

792
00:46:50,281 --> 00:46:52,490
die and those are okay.
Right?

793
00:46:52,530 --> 00:46:56,460
But when innocent people
die and this guy did it,

794
00:46:56,850 --> 00:47:00,030
then it's really bad. And especially
the way he did it. Right. You know,

795
00:47:00,031 --> 00:47:02,690
the way he did it with poison and
we just, we can't take that. That's,

796
00:47:02,740 --> 00:47:05,250
we were drawing along. We're gonna have
to kill some more people because of that.

797
00:47:05,310 --> 00:47:05,851
Right,
right.

798
00:47:05,851 --> 00:47:09,900
And innocent people will die because
we have to protect innocent people.

799
00:47:09,930 --> 00:47:11,400
So we have to go in there.
This guy killed.

800
00:47:11,401 --> 00:47:15,480
Innocent people will probably kill way
more innocent people than a flower if we

801
00:47:15,481 --> 00:47:18,030
went in there. If the army,
the United States army when it,

802
00:47:18,031 --> 00:47:19,620
unless Siri just said fuck this,

803
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:22,590
and they laid down their guns and went
face down and put their hands behind

804
00:47:22,591 --> 00:47:26,130
their heads, immediately someone's
going to die. People are going to die.

805
00:47:26,850 --> 00:47:28,950
It's crazy.
It's like the idea behind it.

806
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:31,080
It's like one of the weirdest
side shows ever. Well, the,

807
00:47:31,081 --> 00:47:33,070
the perspective you're talking about is,

808
00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:38,150
is pretty much purposely kept out of our
u s kind of mainstream news discussion

809
00:47:39,071 --> 00:47:40,720
allowed photograph coffins.

810
00:47:40,750 --> 00:47:43,820
Like that was something that was passed
during the Bush administration. Yeah.

811
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:46,120
You couldn't take photos
of coffin because yeah,

812
00:47:46,150 --> 00:47:49,090
sure that would have an impact
but how we can kill people,

813
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:52,000
but all I'm saying is
that it's okay to do that,

814
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:55,720
but the reality of it should never get
back home cause he could weaken morale.

815
00:47:56,230 --> 00:48:00,550
Yeah. Like Woo, you're, you're,
you're stomping information.

816
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:05,050
Like information is critical for people
to understand the actual parameters of

817
00:48:05,051 --> 00:48:09,280
the situation they're involved in. And
if you change that information a change,

818
00:48:09,281 --> 00:48:12,640
how much of that information gets out,
you greatly alter.

819
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:16,300
If you can't see evidence of it, they're
not seeing bodies, they're not seeing,

820
00:48:16,540 --> 00:48:20,350
they're not seeing the damage. You're not
focusing on the bad stuff. You're not,

821
00:48:20,351 --> 00:48:22,030
you're not being accurate.
Of course,

822
00:48:22,031 --> 00:48:25,510
you're giving a really fucked up
version of what you're talking about.

823
00:48:25,780 --> 00:48:28,450
Governments are good at that,
but that should be illegal.

824
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:32,260
That should be highly illegal.
Like to do that to say to someone,

825
00:48:32,261 --> 00:48:36,200
you can't take a photograph of something
that's actually happening because the,

826
00:48:36,201 --> 00:48:40,480
that idea behind it, the weakening
of morale, like that's crazy.

827
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:44,020
Morale only weekends when it's
supposed to be weakened. Okay.

828
00:48:44,021 --> 00:48:45,960
If we were off their
fighting werewolves and,

829
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:47,860
and bodies were coming back like that,

830
00:48:47,950 --> 00:48:51,010
we would salute them and
praise them and their, their,

831
00:48:51,011 --> 00:48:54,850
their quest to save the human race from
the werewolves that they died. No, Billy,

832
00:48:54,851 --> 00:48:58,300
we would celebrate them. We would fucking
have parades for them, had no belief,

833
00:48:58,301 --> 00:49:01,150
celebrate them. But that's not
what we're doing. We're hiding.

834
00:49:01,270 --> 00:49:02,530
We're hiding the photos.

835
00:49:02,531 --> 00:49:05,680
We don't show them to anybody
because the whole thing is chaos.

836
00:49:05,681 --> 00:49:08,980
And if you really boil it down is it
wasn't worth it that your child died to

837
00:49:08,981 --> 00:49:12,930
promote this agenda. No,
it's not. It's not. It's not,

838
00:49:12,931 --> 00:49:15,760
that's not the only way it could
have been done. That's crazy to say.

839
00:49:15,761 --> 00:49:18,270
It's the only way it could have
been done is absolute bananas. Yeah.

840
00:49:18,910 --> 00:49:22,780
To stay healthy. A diplomatic strategy
works out. I mean, I hope so too.

841
00:49:22,781 --> 00:49:26,530
But I mean I can't believe that we're
still committed to fucking years and years

842
00:49:26,531 --> 00:49:30,850
of war in 2013 and it just doesn't
make any sense anymore. I know, I know.

843
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:33,880
It's interesting too if
you like cause you really,

844
00:49:33,881 --> 00:49:38,230
it didn't really is up to you to figure
out stories. It you have to like,

845
00:49:38,410 --> 00:49:41,800
it's interesting to go to different
sites to see how they present the story,

846
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:44,350
the same story. Oh you know, like you go,

847
00:49:44,770 --> 00:49:49,720
you read CNN and then you read like if
you go to g drudge to see how they report

848
00:49:49,721 --> 00:49:53,290
it and you go to like
BBC, Guardian, Al Jazeera,

849
00:49:53,350 --> 00:49:56,530
you're getting the same story
reported in six different ways. Yeah.

850
00:49:56,650 --> 00:49:59,680
And you got to kind of decipher
if that you've got, you have to,

851
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:04,600
you have to pick up on the fact and
know that everybody has a bias even when

852
00:50:04,601 --> 00:50:09,160
they don't have a bias. You know,
there's built in bias to every angle,

853
00:50:09,310 --> 00:50:10,600
every story.
Oh yeah.

854
00:50:10,620 --> 00:50:14,290
You have to be able to break that down
to whatever degree because you have your

855
00:50:14,291 --> 00:50:18,250
own bias that wants to lean a certain way
and you go, this is the story. I'm, well,

856
00:50:18,270 --> 00:50:22,180
I'm going to run with the one that day
this person reported and that's a big one.

857
00:50:22,180 --> 00:50:26,230
Whenever you've got anyone that's
pushing a left wing or white wing agenda,

858
00:50:26,590 --> 00:50:29,750
whenever you started hearing about
what the Democrats want to do is give

859
00:50:29,751 --> 00:50:34,220
everybody this bit and take all your
hard earned money and like you like, Oh,

860
00:50:34,221 --> 00:50:35,510
you're not even being honest here.

861
00:50:35,511 --> 00:50:39,440
You're just putting it on this puppet
show and you're probably invested in

862
00:50:39,441 --> 00:50:43,130
winning this puppet show or in the Megan
works puppet show. Very convincing.

863
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:46,880
You got lobbyists that are counting on
you to get me to believe your perspective

864
00:50:46,881 --> 00:50:50,840
on this right now. For sure.
They're filling up your
pockets, man. Yeah, whatever.

865
00:50:50,841 --> 00:50:54,200
Addictiveness way to run a government.
The idea that that's how we run it.

866
00:50:54,230 --> 00:50:57,320
I know all this money and influence.
They're all always,

867
00:50:57,470 --> 00:51:01,430
always only thinking about their
next election. Don't worry,

868
00:51:01,490 --> 00:51:04,340
we're thinking of you. Yeah. I'm
not thanking him. All this money.

869
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:08,110
All these people that have this money,
the got me into this position.

870
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:12,320
I don't think about them. I think
about people, I don't know who hate me.

871
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:16,130
That's what I'm concerned with. His
fucking, his favorability rating.

872
00:51:16,131 --> 00:51:19,880
It's like Bush, like now
it's like, is that that low
now? That's pretty low. Yeah.

873
00:51:19,881 --> 00:51:24,440
Let's find out. What's what Obama's
Obama's approval rating. Yeah.

874
00:51:25,220 --> 00:51:29,630
Let's, uh, what was the
worst? The worst? Yeah,

875
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:32,630
I bet the worst was probably,
I'm going to,

876
00:51:32,631 --> 00:51:37,520
I'm going to guess it was something
like 80 years ago and then Bush would be

877
00:51:37,521 --> 00:51:40,690
like second. That's my prediction.
First of all, how crazy is it?

878
00:51:40,730 --> 00:51:45,380
There's something called the
approval rating for the president.

879
00:51:46,340 --> 00:51:47,540
Okay.
Here it is.

880
00:51:48,050 --> 00:51:53,050
47% of likely US voters approve
of Obama's job performance.

881
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:58,340
Okay. I mean, the 52% disapprove. Okay.

882
00:51:58,460 --> 00:52:02,220
That's not horrific. It's definitely, um,

883
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:05,780
it's definitely lower than it's been.
Right. Well, listen to this though.

884
00:52:05,930 --> 00:52:10,310
82% of the Democrats like the job,
the president's doing

885
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:16,840
85% of the Republicans and 50%
57% of the voters not affiliated,

886
00:52:17,690 --> 00:52:22,350
disapprove. Okay. Come on man. You
look on the craft side of that is how,

887
00:52:22,460 --> 00:52:24,830
how silly could you be to say,
I think he's doing a great job.

888
00:52:25,490 --> 00:52:26,600
Number one is Obama,

889
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:30,770
number two is number one
is number one is Bush.

890
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:34,580
That's the lowest approval rating.
Ever. See, lowest approval ratings.

891
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:40,490
His lowest approval was 25 Bush.
And what's the next lowest?

892
00:52:42,380 --> 00:52:44,960
Do you remember when Bush's
approval ratings were fucking high?

893
00:52:45,110 --> 00:52:47,600
Like right after September
11th really high.

894
00:52:47,690 --> 00:52:51,960
You weren't even allowed to make fun of
Bush. It was a really high Truman. Tracy,

895
00:52:52,070 --> 00:52:56,120
I told you. And then Nixon,
what's, what was Truman's down to?

896
00:52:56,310 --> 00:52:59,060
22 okay.
This is the,

897
00:52:59,390 --> 00:53:01,790
this is what his approval
rate is on foreign policy.

898
00:53:02,090 --> 00:53:06,890
40% wow. Wow. That's really low man.

899
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:11,120
Uh Huh.
I think Obama,

900
00:53:11,930 --> 00:53:14,660
it's just like every other thing
that happens in this world.

901
00:53:14,930 --> 00:53:19,420
You probably go into it thinking that
you're going to change it and you're going

902
00:53:19,421 --> 00:53:22,100
to fix it. And did you think,
do you have a great president?

903
00:53:22,130 --> 00:53:26,100
You have high hopes for him? Yeah. Yeah.
I mean I think he's a brilliant man.

904
00:53:26,550 --> 00:53:29,880
You know, I don't, I just don't know
how much the president honestly gets to,

905
00:53:29,881 --> 00:53:34,710
I don't want to even speculate on how
much of an effect of president actually

906
00:53:34,711 --> 00:53:38,030
gets to to push how much,
you know,

907
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:41,860
how much influence does this one human
being actually have? Do you think?

908
00:53:41,890 --> 00:53:46,120
A lot of it behind closed doors, it was
like, so here's what's going to happen.

909
00:53:46,190 --> 00:53:50,850
Much money involved, man. You're
talking about people that run banks.

910
00:53:51,150 --> 00:53:56,150
You're talking about people that demanded
that they get bailed out by the United

911
00:53:56,940 --> 00:53:59,610
States taxpayer after
fucking the United States.

912
00:53:59,611 --> 00:54:04,611
Taxpayers sideways into a point where
the the economy eroded radically in all

913
00:54:07,741 --> 00:54:12,690
businesses. These people cause this
and they still got bonuses. Okay,

914
00:54:12,691 --> 00:54:13,350
this,

915
00:54:13,350 --> 00:54:18,350
these people caused this and Obama went
on TV and said that they're going to get

916
00:54:18,870 --> 00:54:20,910
the, we're going to, we're going to limit

917
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:27,800
the amount of money that they receive
as a bonus to $500,000 a paltry sum for

918
00:54:28,201 --> 00:54:32,160
such rich folk Q Magine.
Even saying that as a statement,

919
00:54:32,161 --> 00:54:36,990
we're going to limit the bonuses of the
companies where we have to pay millions

920
00:54:36,991 --> 00:54:41,260
of your dollars. We're going to limit
them out. They steal to 500,000 yeah,

921
00:54:41,310 --> 00:54:44,370
we've put a cap on it. No, go to bed.

922
00:54:44,910 --> 00:54:48,840
And then like your whole bomb that there
might be one of the nuttiest things

923
00:54:48,841 --> 00:54:50,670
that a guy has ever said on television.

924
00:54:50,850 --> 00:54:55,170
We're going to limit the thieves who
ruined the economy to a half a million

925
00:54:55,171 --> 00:54:56,004
dollar bonus.

926
00:54:56,540 --> 00:55:01,470
Like oh good people that
we asked to watch over.

927
00:55:01,471 --> 00:55:03,360
Hey you guys are the financial guys,
right?

928
00:55:03,510 --> 00:55:05,490
Please watch over this
fucking thing with numbers.

929
00:55:05,491 --> 00:55:08,100
Cause I have kids and I got a job
but I don't have time to do this.

930
00:55:08,190 --> 00:55:10,890
So do we have, do we have
a guy, we've got a guy,

931
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:16,170
he went to Harvard and then if you ever
watched that documentary inside job,

932
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:20,850
you ever watch that? Holy Shit. It's
not about nine 11 folks. It's about,

933
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:24,300
it's about the economy crash. It's
an unbelievable, it's incredible.

934
00:55:24,330 --> 00:55:28,140
And the guy who is doing it is
brilliant and he catches these dudes,

935
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:31,990
corners them and ask them questions
and you see them squirm and panic and,

936
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:35,250
and then you find out like there's a
lot of these guys that were working in

937
00:55:35,251 --> 00:55:37,500
universities that were
responsible for these studies.

938
00:55:37,620 --> 00:55:40,140
They leave the university and
you get these awesome jobs.

939
00:55:40,141 --> 00:55:45,141
The banks whose policies that
they recommended promoted
this sort of like free

940
00:55:46,831 --> 00:55:49,650
range,
wild kamikaze,

941
00:55:49,651 --> 00:55:54,450
swashbuckling capitalism that cause all
these fucking people to lose their homes.

942
00:55:54,451 --> 00:55:59,370
It causes, these guys get jobs working
for those firms after they leave.

943
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:02,970
So they're like educators and they're
like, this is should be no problem.

944
00:56:02,971 --> 00:56:04,990
I see this should be no
problem. And then they, they,

945
00:56:05,170 --> 00:56:09,180
they pass all this shit and it's the
most obvious shell game of all time.

946
00:56:09,180 --> 00:56:13,380
It's so in your face. Yeah, it
really is. It's really, look,

947
00:56:13,381 --> 00:56:14,960
it's kind of admirable and stuff.

948
00:56:14,980 --> 00:56:16,860
You want to look at it from
a gangster point of view.

949
00:56:16,950 --> 00:56:20,100
I mean it's the most gangster shit ever.
We glorify gangster rap,

950
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:22,740
gangster rap can't fuck
with gangster banking. No.

951
00:56:22,750 --> 00:56:25,240
Gangster street is the most
gangster shit of all time.

952
00:56:25,300 --> 00:56:26,950
They've done some gangster shit.
Yeah.

953
00:56:27,130 --> 00:56:31,510
And what it means is that worse than
the gangster shit that's been going on

954
00:56:31,511 --> 00:56:36,510
right now and from the beginning of the
Iraq war, that's pretty gangster too.

955
00:56:36,990 --> 00:56:40,480
You know, I mean that's this one one
destroys lives and financial stakes.

956
00:56:40,481 --> 00:56:44,170
The other one kills lives. It kills
people. It destroys everything.

957
00:56:44,410 --> 00:56:49,410
Like how come that is that that ganking
that gangster ganking that we saw.

958
00:56:49,570 --> 00:56:53,800
How come that's like less offensive than
this financial gangster ganking there

959
00:56:53,801 --> 00:56:57,910
pull pretty gangster fucks
people up bad. Look, it's,

960
00:56:57,911 --> 00:57:02,470
it's madness man. It's, we
are mad. We're mad. Mad,

961
00:57:02,471 --> 00:57:03,750
mad race.
Yeah.

962
00:57:04,180 --> 00:57:08,170
And I think we're getting less mad
but we got to figure this out man.

963
00:57:08,230 --> 00:57:10,660
We can't just keep doing this.
We can't just keep going to war.

964
00:57:10,990 --> 00:57:12,060
I've heard a lot of,
uh,

965
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:17,200
financial people lately say that
like the worst is yet to come in,

966
00:57:17,201 --> 00:57:21,940
in a coming soon kind of way. You know,
as far as like, oh, eight collapse.

967
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:25,960
But that's just going to
go way further downhill.

968
00:57:26,430 --> 00:57:31,000
What I heard is that the commercial real
estate crash is a really dangerous one.

969
00:57:31,510 --> 00:57:34,570
Really? I've heard that once. A
real dangerous one. That commercial,

970
00:57:34,571 --> 00:57:37,240
like once you have residential
real estate crash, like that one,

971
00:57:37,390 --> 00:57:42,070
there's a commercial one that's
much larger apparently. Allegedly.

972
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:45,490
I don't understand that though. So even
me saying that, it's just bullshit.

973
00:57:45,850 --> 00:57:46,990
I Dunno what keeps it up.

974
00:57:46,990 --> 00:57:50,350
I don't know how the fuck they rescue
the economy or did they even rescue the

975
00:57:50,351 --> 00:57:53,230
economy? You know, should the bank's
been allowed to fail? Who's right?

976
00:57:53,231 --> 00:57:56,980
Peter Schiff is Peter Schiff. Right. You
know, I don't know. I don't understand it.

977
00:57:57,190 --> 00:57:59,870
I don't understand any of
it. I don't know, man. I,

978
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:03,700
I'm definitely not the mind to put that
together, but it's, it's pretty bad.

979
00:58:03,701 --> 00:58:06,940
I think. You know what? I know for sure
though, this is not the only way to do it,

980
00:58:07,390 --> 00:58:08,950
right?
This is not the only way to do it.

981
00:58:08,980 --> 00:58:13,980
This whole stocks and bonds and
derivatives and like you guys have created

982
00:58:14,531 --> 00:58:16,150
fucking chaos.

983
00:58:16,270 --> 00:58:20,320
You have a chaotic system and
that system is fucking awful.

984
00:58:20,321 --> 00:58:25,321
It's like windows NT from like 1997 and
you'd go inside of it and start fucking

985
00:58:27,161 --> 00:58:32,050
with the registry and bed yourself and
like you don't know what the fuck is in

986
00:58:32,051 --> 00:58:36,700
this crazy economy. The amount of
influence that affects the politicians,

987
00:58:36,701 --> 00:58:40,630
which affects the laws being passed,
which affects the judges being elected,

988
00:58:40,631 --> 00:58:45,190
which affects the decisions being made
that literally changed the entire scope

989
00:58:45,191 --> 00:58:49,450
of the nation and it's all motivated
by money. Yeah, yeah, it is.

990
00:58:49,630 --> 00:58:50,500
And the other thing that,

991
00:58:50,501 --> 00:58:55,501
the big advantage that those guys have
that work in that field is they have a

992
00:58:55,601 --> 00:59:00,601
specific knowledge that basically the
overwhelming majority of people can't

993
00:59:00,671 --> 00:59:04,600
grasp. Like not because we're not capable,
we're just not well versed in this.

994
00:59:04,630 --> 00:59:08,530
Right. And people start talking about
derivatives and short sales and all this.

995
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:10,450
Most people are going, I don't know what
the fuck you're talking about. Yeah,

996
00:59:10,451 --> 00:59:12,970
I don't know. So I'm talking about
when I said it that that goes,

997
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,400
but then that makes things
go unregulated unchecked.

998
00:59:15,401 --> 00:59:19,570
It's like when doctors have a conversation
or pilots and they start getting into

999
00:59:19,571 --> 00:59:22,070
the specifics of their
field. At a certain point, if

1000
00:59:22,070 --> 00:59:23,240
you're not one of those people,
you're like,

1001
00:59:23,270 --> 00:59:26,000
I don't know what you're talking about
and it's not for you. And you're like,

1002
00:59:26,030 --> 00:59:26,690
okay,

1003
00:59:26,690 --> 00:59:31,160
except this one really affects
most of us a great deal,

1004
00:59:31,161 --> 00:59:33,350
but we don't know what the
fuck is happening. Yeah.

1005
00:59:33,351 --> 00:59:36,740
To me and might as well be once people
start talking about golf scores. Sure.

1006
00:59:36,741 --> 00:59:40,490
He was six under and the five
get to birdies and an eagle man.

1007
00:59:40,491 --> 00:59:45,200
What are you saying? Yeah, of course.
And he took a Mulligan. What? Golf Guy?

1008
00:59:45,590 --> 00:59:49,700
No, I've never even played Guy Shot
Jim Furich shot a 59 last week.

1009
00:59:49,730 --> 00:59:53,000
I have no idea what that means. See, you
just said it right there. Pretty curable.

1010
00:59:53,870 --> 00:59:57,280
Yeah. That, that numbers thing
is a scary one to not be,

1011
00:59:57,560 --> 01:00:01,910
to not to be math illiterate like I
am. I'm with you. Quite frightening.

1012
01:00:01,940 --> 01:00:06,440
I'm with you. What do you think of one 14,
one 14. Is that a good score? For what?

1013
01:00:06,620 --> 01:00:10,100
For a boxing. If you watch the
Mayweather. Oh, Jesus Christ.

1014
01:00:10,101 --> 01:00:12,650
That woman who also scored,
um,

1015
01:00:13,030 --> 01:00:16,790
a Paki out losing to
Bradley's. Yeah. Tim Bradley.

1016
01:00:17,300 --> 01:00:21,080
That lady's crazy. She has a different
view of boxing than most people.

1017
01:00:21,830 --> 01:00:23,840
I got lucky man. I, uh, I was,

1018
01:00:23,900 --> 01:00:27,770
I had a show in Lauderdale and I
was doing it at the, at the Improv,

1019
01:00:28,220 --> 01:00:32,300
which is connected to the
hard rock casino. So I knew
the fight and I was like,

1020
01:00:32,301 --> 01:00:36,980
I'm gonna miss the fight, whatever. I
had two shows. I mean I take my time,

1021
01:00:36,981 --> 01:00:39,650
I finished, should I get paid?
I'm just like hanging out.

1022
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:44,120
I walked back to my room and as I enter
the casino, and this is in Hollywood,

1023
01:00:44,121 --> 01:00:44,954
Florida,

1024
01:00:45,410 --> 01:00:49,580
there are a fuck an extra 3000
people in the casino. I'm like,

1025
01:00:49,820 --> 01:00:54,290
what is going on? Every monitor in the
casino showing the fight. So I was like,

1026
01:00:54,291 --> 01:00:56,060
oh great. And it was only
the end of the third round.

1027
01:00:56,061 --> 01:01:00,920
So I got to watch from basically round
four on the whole casino showed the

1028
01:01:00,921 --> 01:01:03,440
fight. That's incredible.
Everybody stopped.

1029
01:01:03,441 --> 01:01:08,270
There were so many people stopped in,
in like in,

1030
01:01:08,300 --> 01:01:11,690
in between slot machines,
just like looking up just
to watch this fight. It was,

1031
01:01:11,691 --> 01:01:14,060
it was incredible to see that spectacle,

1032
01:01:14,061 --> 01:01:18,560
the people watching it and yeah, I mean
we watched, like I said, the rest of the,

1033
01:01:18,590 --> 01:01:22,100
after the end of round
three on and you know,

1034
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:25,220
I think even to like novice boxing,

1035
01:01:25,221 --> 01:01:29,330
people like Floyd pretty much put on a
clinic, you know? Yeah. It was ridiculous.

1036
01:01:29,390 --> 01:01:32,660
I mean this woman squirted even even,
it's crazy.

1037
01:01:32,810 --> 01:01:37,550
I think even I think somebody who didn't
know what's going on like we're talking

1038
01:01:37,551 --> 01:01:40,250
about. Yeah. Would note
that it wasn't even,

1039
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:45,110
well I think that there's some crazy
people out there and I think there's also

1040
01:01:45,111 --> 01:01:49,250
the possibility of corruption and both
of those need to be considered as options

1041
01:01:49,550 --> 01:01:49,760
either.

1042
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:54,760
She's crazy and she just likes to judge
Shit professionally that she has no idea

1043
01:01:55,101 --> 01:01:57,020
about. I mean, I never talked to,

1044
01:01:57,021 --> 01:02:00,770
I haven't talked to a single person that
thought it even made a bit of sense.

1045
01:02:01,010 --> 01:02:03,410
It's not like one of those,
well you know what,

1046
01:02:03,500 --> 01:02:06,860
she favors defense and the shell
defense is very impressive.

1047
01:02:06,861 --> 01:02:09,790
And he did land a couple of heart
counters like, no, no, no, no.

1048
01:02:10,330 --> 01:02:13,670
There was no one's saying that like
this is if you thought that he won that

1049
01:02:13,671 --> 01:02:16,610
fight or you thought it was a draw,
you're a crazy person.

1050
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:20,250
The fact that your track record
now includes the Pacquiao,

1051
01:02:20,250 --> 01:02:24,540
Bradley, this, that's what
those are both on your resume.

1052
01:02:24,570 --> 01:02:27,750
That lady does not pay attention
either. She does not pay attention. No,

1053
01:02:27,751 --> 01:02:31,890
she's crazy. Or She's getting paid.
Right. I don't want to say that you did.

1054
01:02:31,891 --> 01:02:35,940
I'm glad Brian Red Band said that
and not me because I sometimes Brian,

1055
01:02:35,941 --> 01:02:39,060
I work in the presence of the Nevada state
athletic commission and I would never

1056
01:02:39,061 --> 01:02:43,380
accuse them of such a thing. Right?
However, if I was an investigator,

1057
01:02:43,381 --> 01:02:47,040
I would look into it sharply. Yeah,
yeah. There's just something wrong.

1058
01:02:47,190 --> 01:02:50,730
There's just something wrong, and if it's
not corruption, which I hope it's not,

1059
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:54,550
it's just incompetence and either way,
it shouldn't be tolerated. You didn't,

1060
01:02:54,560 --> 01:02:56,760
you know something. No one
deserves their job. Right.

1061
01:02:57,030 --> 01:02:59,520
Especially when it's that kind of a job.
You don't deserve that job.

1062
01:02:59,521 --> 01:03:01,800
You have that job because you're
supposed to be a professional at it.

1063
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:05,700
You're supposed to be really good at it.
And when you're unbelievably,

1064
01:03:06,150 --> 01:03:09,900
embarrassingly, Baz and him were
in bearably unbearably unbearably,

1065
01:03:09,901 --> 01:03:13,740
but I went in Blair ugly. It's not a
word, but she so bad. It's criminal.

1066
01:03:14,310 --> 01:03:17,010
It's criminal.
It's like me teaching Spanish lessons,

1067
01:03:17,090 --> 01:03:19,920
but I don't know how to speak Spanish.
Right. So if I tell you to speak Spanish,

1068
01:03:20,130 --> 01:03:25,080
that she would be criminal. Criminal.
It's not. It's not. Okay. Snoop Lion,

1069
01:03:25,081 --> 01:03:29,370
we jackpot wins. Pound of weed off
the Mayweather fight. Oh, he bet.

1070
01:03:29,371 --> 01:03:31,710
A pound of weed.
All that's hilarious.

1071
01:03:31,980 --> 01:03:35,340
Looking at him with a pound of weed
and a captain America shirt on.

1072
01:03:35,610 --> 01:03:39,260
He's a bad ass. Look at this guy who
did the bed it with Scott to say,

1073
01:03:40,860 --> 01:03:42,780
you know how much is a
pound of weed these days?

1074
01:03:43,030 --> 01:03:46,380
I don't know.
A Mexican guy named Lou Lou.

1075
01:03:46,850 --> 01:03:51,380
That's hilarious. I've never had
a pound of weed in my life. No.

1076
01:03:51,381 --> 01:03:55,820
It's about $40,000. That's insane. I've
never even had more than an ounce. Like,

1077
01:03:55,821 --> 01:03:59,300
I don't want to carry a lot
of weed around. No, no, no,
no. I understand. I've seen,

1078
01:03:59,301 --> 01:04:02,900
uh, a quarter a quarter pound
QP. If I saw a bag that big,

1079
01:04:02,930 --> 01:04:07,930
I would assume the next thing I want to
hear his boots kicking the door and get

1080
01:04:07,941 --> 01:04:12,260
all your fucking, and I'm going to
like, okay, I'm a comedian, drug dealer.

1081
01:04:12,360 --> 01:04:16,620
What's scary in Ohio?
Allegedly my dealer growing up in college,

1082
01:04:16,650 --> 01:04:20,250
that's how much he would
have. Oh Hi. Oh that's scary.

1083
01:04:20,251 --> 01:04:24,000
Cause like he would have three pit bulls,
two chows and just like,

1084
01:04:24,030 --> 01:04:26,640
like you'd come in this house and
then like all these crazy dogs,

1085
01:04:26,790 --> 01:04:29,250
you just pull up the humongous
bag and put it right there.

1086
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:30,660
And he like trusted me.

1087
01:04:30,661 --> 01:04:33,930
So he like showed me all the shit
he had and like all the secrets,

1088
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:38,190
like pounds of weed that he has
hidden everywhere. Hod is crazy.

1089
01:04:38,360 --> 01:04:39,630
I grew up around that.

1090
01:04:41,040 --> 01:04:45,300
A guy here who did, who
deal that here had um,

1091
01:04:45,360 --> 01:04:46,530
like a big SUV,

1092
01:04:46,531 --> 01:04:50,760
like an Escalade and he had
compartments built in there.

1093
01:04:51,240 --> 01:04:55,740
Um, where the way it was rigged was that
the radio station had to be tuned to a

1094
01:04:55,741 --> 01:04:57,870
certain channel and that would unlock,

1095
01:04:58,260 --> 01:05:00,240
then he would be able to
unlock the compartments.

1096
01:05:01,290 --> 01:05:05,790
So it had to be like a 91.7 and
then he would go click, click.

1097
01:05:07,780 --> 01:05:10,420
That's so crazy as to transport.

1098
01:05:10,421 --> 01:05:14,370
Like you know that a guy went to
jail for a long time because he was

1099
01:05:14,371 --> 01:05:17,380
constructing those. Oh really? Yeah.

1100
01:05:17,381 --> 01:05:21,640
He went to jail for like a real stretch
and they accused him of aiding and

1101
01:05:21,641 --> 01:05:24,370
abetting.
Somehow or another they set this guy up.

1102
01:05:24,850 --> 01:05:29,200
Okay me build like hidden compartments,
hidden compartments,

1103
01:05:29,260 --> 01:05:34,130
jail. Did you ever, oh here we go.

1104
01:05:34,280 --> 01:05:34,860
Guys

1105
01:05:34,860 --> 01:05:36,440
gets one of my mods.

1106
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:40,460
This has to do with a CD drive
and a secret compartment.

1107
01:05:40,490 --> 01:05:43,190
One of many of my inventions.

1108
01:05:44,030 --> 01:05:48,380
And I know they've used CD drives before
but not in vehicles and as far as to my

1109
01:05:48,381 --> 01:05:52,890
knowledge and not like this. And
what I've done is uh, this is a key

1110
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:58,430
and it's a battery stick.
Your tongue ship, it would
zap you don't do that stupid.

1111
01:05:58,940 --> 01:06:00,530
Anyways.
And these are two taps.

1112
01:06:00,620 --> 01:06:05,120
It is really a nine volt battery and
the power supply goes through this.

1113
01:06:05,180 --> 01:06:09,860
Open up my event,
which reveals my secret compartment,

1114
01:06:09,861 --> 01:06:13,820
and I'm basically took the CD drive apart,
use the the bare basics.

1115
01:06:14,200 --> 01:06:16,530
No,
this is total extra cash in your change

1116
01:06:18,530 --> 01:06:21,050
to it and whatnot.
So he pushes his result.

1117
01:06:22,340 --> 01:06:26,020
It's just a regular nine volt batteries
holding out. He puts it right there. Oh,

1118
01:06:28,210 --> 01:06:29,890
come on now guys.
James Bond,

1119
01:06:30,360 --> 01:06:34,310
you know your wallet,
Your Keys, little extra.

1120
01:06:34,650 --> 01:06:38,990
He said, oh, you know your wallet.
I thought he said, Pino Pinot noir

1121
01:06:42,140 --> 01:06:46,300
glasses, chilled bitches.
Stepping on my 79 impala

1122
01:06:47,900 --> 01:06:51,710
glass of wine can make it a game
for this around, and then it closes.

1123
01:06:52,550 --> 01:06:57,380
That's still flip it to go in and
flip it to go out. That's insane.

1124
01:06:57,381 --> 01:07:01,210
You change the battery.
That is insane. That

1125
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:08,220
[inaudible]

1126
01:07:08,980 --> 01:07:13,670
super boy. I was thinking, Damn. That
was awesome, man. That was awesome.

1127
01:07:13,730 --> 01:07:17,530
Do you ever see the French connection?
You've seen it, right? Yes ma'am. Oh,

1128
01:07:17,550 --> 01:07:20,390
so long ago. Those Gene Hackman, right?
Yeah. It's fucking awesome movie, man.

1129
01:07:20,450 --> 01:07:23,000
I don't know. I don't know. I
don't remember a thing about it.

1130
01:07:23,300 --> 01:07:27,580
I remember it was awesome, but I watch
it to watch it again. Smuggling. Yes.

1131
01:07:27,590 --> 01:07:31,040
And it's so good. It's like
a classic, um, you know,

1132
01:07:31,070 --> 01:07:35,330
cop fucking carbon bad
guy movie from that era.

1133
01:07:35,331 --> 01:07:39,080
So I think it's a late seventies movie.
It's so good. You've seen it, Brian.

1134
01:07:39,650 --> 01:07:42,620
You got to see it. Okay. Is it about like
something like that? It's like trucks.

1135
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:46,580
Yeah, absolutely. It's a heroin. Yeah.
This was the guy I was talking about.

1136
01:07:46,670 --> 01:07:50,420
His name is Alfred and Naya and it says
he was a genius at installing secret

1137
01:07:50,421 --> 01:07:52,940
compartments in cars and uh,

1138
01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:57,920
and so they were used to smuggle drugs
without his knowledge and now he's in

1139
01:07:57,921 --> 01:08:00,830
trouble if they were used to
smuggle drugs without his knowledge,

1140
01:08:00,831 --> 01:08:04,420
he figured it wasn't a problem, he
was wrong and it said, uh, he, they,

1141
01:08:04,421 --> 01:08:08,990
they locked him up, man. Wow.
He lived in the valley and um,

1142
01:08:09,290 --> 01:08:14,290
he would set up these compartments
like in the trucks back seat,

1143
01:08:14,420 --> 01:08:16,280
the trucks back seat where he would,

1144
01:08:16,610 --> 01:08:19,910
he rigged up a set of hydraulic cylinders
that link to the vehicle's electrical

1145
01:08:19,911 --> 01:08:23,900
system. The only way to make the seats
slide forward and reveal its secret was by

1146
01:08:23,901 --> 01:08:27,990
pressing and holding four
switches simultaneously to, uh,

1147
01:08:28,010 --> 01:08:30,620
for the power door locks
and two for the windows.

1148
01:08:30,830 --> 01:08:34,430
So who press all four of those the same
time and it would open up the back seat.

1149
01:08:34,490 --> 01:08:35,780
So awesome.
Yeah.

1150
01:08:36,110 --> 01:08:39,920
He said the seal was no longer responsible
to the switch combination that no

1151
01:08:39,921 --> 01:08:44,720
amount of jiggling could make it budge.
Pleaded with the guy to take a look.

1152
01:08:45,240 --> 01:08:45,520
Okay.

1153
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:48,940
You know, this is how Bieber
roles, he's got like the high tech,

1154
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:52,440
the most high tech whenever
probably if Bieber. Yeah, yeah.

1155
01:08:52,860 --> 01:08:57,130
If they pull that motherfucker over all
the time and there's never has anything

1156
01:08:57,131 --> 01:08:57,941
in his car,
but yet,

1157
01:08:57,941 --> 01:09:02,110
like TMZ always has pictures of him like
holding bongs out window. Oh, brilliant.

1158
01:09:02,170 --> 01:09:03,003
Water into the,

1159
01:09:03,230 --> 01:09:07,250
so they set this guy up, listen to this.
The guy's name was a a [inaudible]. Right.

1160
01:09:07,280 --> 01:09:09,200
And so, um, there was this,

1161
01:09:09,201 --> 01:09:14,201
a dude named Esteban and he was saying
that the switch to the combination

1162
01:09:15,050 --> 01:09:18,710
doesn't work anymore and no amount of
jiggling could get it to work again.

1163
01:09:19,130 --> 01:09:24,130
And so this guy shows up to fix it and
he's a little suspicious because there's

1164
01:09:24,500 --> 01:09:27,470
nothing elite. There's nothing
illegal about building traps,

1165
01:09:27,650 --> 01:09:30,800
which are commonly used to hide
everything from pricey jewelry to illegal

1166
01:09:30,801 --> 01:09:34,190
handguns. But the activity runs
afoul of carrier California law.

1167
01:09:34,220 --> 01:09:38,030
If an installer knows for certain that
his compartment will be used to transport

1168
01:09:38,031 --> 01:09:41,180
drugs. So if the guy told him that
it's going to transport drugs,

1169
01:09:41,420 --> 01:09:45,110
then he has a responsibility to either
call the police or not building or what

1170
01:09:45,111 --> 01:09:49,460
have you. The maximum penalty is three
years in prison. And so this guy,

1171
01:09:50,060 --> 01:09:52,940
the guy who got arrested, he thought
it was wise to deviate from a standard,

1172
01:09:52,941 --> 01:09:57,650
no questions asked policy before green.
So he suspected this guy and he said,

1173
01:09:57,651 --> 01:10:00,110
there's nothing in there I
should know about is there.

1174
01:10:00,410 --> 01:10:03,980
Esteban assured him that he needn't
worry, I'll say, this is fucked up man.

1175
01:10:04,010 --> 01:10:06,530
So he's saying don't worry
about it. Like, yeah.

1176
01:10:08,570 --> 01:10:13,390
So the guy didn't give in to saying,
Hey,

1177
01:10:13,430 --> 01:10:15,020
I'm going to use it for this,
and the guy goes, all right,

1178
01:10:15,021 --> 01:10:19,010
I'll build it for you anyway.
Yeah. Well this is weird, man.

1179
01:10:19,180 --> 01:10:20,960
This is the lock that guy up. They, they,

1180
01:10:21,020 --> 01:10:25,220
they fucking set this guy up because this
guy was making compartments for people

1181
01:10:25,221 --> 01:10:27,710
but not asking any questions.
That's what it was.

1182
01:10:28,220 --> 01:10:29,720
But I don't think that's illegal.

1183
01:10:30,410 --> 01:10:33,110
I think you're allowed to hide shit cause
you're going to let you know what if

1184
01:10:33,111 --> 01:10:35,080
you have money, do you
want to leave? You know,

1185
01:10:35,090 --> 01:10:39,650
something expensive or you own a
jewelry store. Yeah, no. Well yeah,

1186
01:10:39,651 --> 01:10:43,110
if you have expensive stuff
on you all the time, yeah,

1187
01:10:43,510 --> 01:10:46,310
you should be able to hide that you
own a business. It's a cash business.

1188
01:10:46,311 --> 01:10:47,031
You want to transplant.

1189
01:10:47,031 --> 01:10:50,450
You can assume that if someone can
hide something in their home that they

1190
01:10:50,451 --> 01:10:52,220
shouldn't be able to hide
something in their car.

1191
01:10:52,930 --> 01:10:57,380
That's your property to this is that
weirdness of like searching people's cars,

1192
01:10:57,381 --> 01:11:01,340
man. You know, because you don't come to
a person's house and search their house.

1193
01:11:01,341 --> 01:11:04,390
Like why are you searching their
car? Yeah. Like you, you're, you.

1194
01:11:04,430 --> 01:11:07,040
Cause you know that people transport
drugs, things with their car.

1195
01:11:07,041 --> 01:11:08,360
But at the end of the day,

1196
01:11:08,390 --> 01:11:12,730
it's fucking private property and whether
there is $1,000 in cash in the back

1197
01:11:12,731 --> 01:11:13,080
seat,

1198
01:11:13,080 --> 01:11:16,380
you're gonna steal from us because you
think there were were buying drugs with

1199
01:11:16,381 --> 01:11:18,240
it.
That's happened before where people,

1200
01:11:18,241 --> 01:11:21,330
like there was a stripper who
had like $1 million in her trunk.

1201
01:11:21,570 --> 01:11:25,650
This crazy bitch like made $1 million
and was going to buy a business and she

1202
01:11:25,651 --> 01:11:26,041
had this money,

1203
01:11:26,041 --> 01:11:28,890
he's got arrested and the cops had to
give the money back to her because they

1204
01:11:28,900 --> 01:11:30,510
suspected her of being a drug dealer.

1205
01:11:30,750 --> 01:11:34,760
And then she had to document all of
her pay or hone and show all dogs.

1206
01:11:36,480 --> 01:11:40,130
Do you have any? Oh my God. Like
they say dat ass, but the, the,

1207
01:11:40,131 --> 01:11:43,920
you know the cops took that money as
if like you can't have money if you had

1208
01:11:43,921 --> 01:11:47,670
money. It has to come from drugs. A
lot of money. Yeah, but why can't you?

1209
01:11:47,700 --> 01:11:50,720
Don't worry, I'm don't people have
houses? How did they buy a house? Yeah.

1210
01:11:50,850 --> 01:11:53,550
Who's to say you can't just go to a guy
with a fucking trunk full of cash and

1211
01:11:53,551 --> 01:11:54,960
buy a house. You can, you know,

1212
01:11:55,050 --> 01:11:57,060
just because everybody else
uses a fucking credit card.

1213
01:11:57,180 --> 01:11:58,740
If you decide you hate credit cards,

1214
01:11:58,741 --> 01:12:00,570
you want to store it all
in a safe in your house,

1215
01:12:01,050 --> 01:12:02,890
and I only know the combination does it?

1216
01:12:02,910 --> 01:12:05,730
The cop have to look in there and
see if there's anything wrong.

1217
01:12:05,780 --> 01:12:07,890
If he sees that there's money in there,
hey,

1218
01:12:08,070 --> 01:12:10,320
what are you doing with
all this good stuff?

1219
01:12:10,520 --> 01:12:12,780
What do you do with all this
stuff that everybody earns?

1220
01:12:13,510 --> 01:12:17,500
Why do you have to declare? I was
thinking about the border thing. I mean,

1221
01:12:17,501 --> 01:12:22,180
I assume that you have to declare
money big so that they can investigate.

1222
01:12:22,210 --> 01:12:25,990
Yes. Whether what's the source of that
money? What do you have that money for?

1223
01:12:26,110 --> 01:12:27,760
But there's this whole
thing you have to declare.

1224
01:12:27,790 --> 01:12:31,750
If you have over 10,000 let's say going
into Ken or coming back in the United

1225
01:12:31,750 --> 01:12:34,840
States, right? Right. What if you have
a lot of money and, right. Why do you,

1226
01:12:34,841 --> 01:12:37,180
why do I have to explain to you
that I don't have this problem?

1227
01:12:37,390 --> 01:12:41,830
But I've thought about it before. Like
we're like, you know, obviously they're,

1228
01:12:41,831 --> 01:12:45,250
they're asking so it'd be so
that if somebody does like
they don't say they have

1229
01:12:45,251 --> 01:12:49,030
it, then they do with it. Then they
find that they have 15,000 in cash.

1230
01:12:49,031 --> 01:12:51,430
They're going to be like,
why do you have this much cash was I do,

1231
01:12:51,620 --> 01:12:55,310
I wonder if you have to like when
you report it, how's that work?

1232
01:12:55,580 --> 01:12:56,830
If you have to report the Alex,

1233
01:12:56,950 --> 01:13:00,680
let's say you're some crazy ball or type
character. Yeah. And you know, he'll like,

1234
01:13:00,860 --> 01:13:03,290
who would you be like if you were
going to be a mall or type character,

1235
01:13:03,340 --> 01:13:06,080
we have to be a black guy.
Right? Who would you be? What?
Which rapper would you be?

1236
01:13:06,081 --> 01:13:07,160
The walks around with a suitcase of cash.

1237
01:13:07,190 --> 01:13:10,070
Let's say you're Floyd Mayweather cause
he would walk around with suitcases full

1238
01:13:10,071 --> 01:13:13,820
of cats. Absolutely. Why can't
Floyd Mayweather? He probably,

1239
01:13:13,821 --> 01:13:16,730
they probably wouldn't let them in
Canada because he's got some domestic

1240
01:13:16,731 --> 01:13:19,670
violence charges. That's what
he did his 30 days or whatever.

1241
01:13:19,671 --> 01:13:22,370
They might not even let you know because
Canada is pretty strict about letting

1242
01:13:22,371 --> 01:13:26,510
you know shit like that. They don't
fuck around. But if he did get through,

1243
01:13:26,540 --> 01:13:30,980
he probably would get through
like a hundred grand and
a backpack and some Gucci

1244
01:13:30,981 --> 01:13:33,050
sack or something like that.

1245
01:13:33,680 --> 01:13:38,480
Did you see the all access for him and
Canelo? No, I didn't. I didn't. Dude.

1246
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:41,450
I've watched them before,
but like I didn't see it this time.

1247
01:13:41,510 --> 01:13:45,230
He sends one of his girls to go pick up
some of his gambling debt is gambling

1248
01:13:45,231 --> 01:13:49,550
money hoodie one.
She goes in this like ostrich skin.

1249
01:13:49,940 --> 01:13:53,870
I don't know who the fuck my ex at some
super expensive bag and the guy puts

1250
01:13:53,871 --> 01:13:58,850
$480,000 in the bag and then
she walks it out of there.

1251
01:13:58,851 --> 01:14:02,940
It gets in her car and drives it to
money. Mayweather. Hey Floyd. Yeah, he's,

1252
01:14:03,050 --> 01:14:06,590
he was headed to his house. But you want
on Duke? Do you know how crazy that is?

1253
01:14:06,591 --> 01:14:11,530
Duke, Maryland. She's saying he's, he's
gambling that kind of money. Oh, I mean,

1254
01:14:11,531 --> 01:14:15,010
he always taught,
he takes the photos of his betting slips.

1255
01:14:15,550 --> 01:14:17,320
I know he's crazy.

1256
01:14:17,350 --> 01:14:22,150
It's $480,000 he won.
And they're not even like,

1257
01:14:22,180 --> 01:14:27,180
it's sometimes his bets are like these
like kind of side bet like prop bets.

1258
01:14:27,341 --> 01:14:28,270
They're like,
where it's like,

1259
01:14:28,690 --> 01:14:33,610
uh, I'm betting on who's the first
to 12 points in his basketball game.

1260
01:14:33,640 --> 01:14:35,500
You know what I mean?
Not even like the outcome of the game.

1261
01:14:35,830 --> 01:14:40,120
Like he's bitten this shit like that
where it's a total just gambling rush kind

1262
01:14:40,121 --> 01:14:43,950
of battery life.
I'll put 25 grand that it's the 70 sixers.

1263
01:14:44,070 --> 01:14:46,740
Well, you want to know what's
interesting? They have, uh,

1264
01:14:46,830 --> 01:14:51,260
found a direct correlation
between head trauma and, uh,

1265
01:14:51,300 --> 01:14:53,570
addiction to gambling. Really? Yeah.

1266
01:14:53,580 --> 01:14:56,620
I brought it up to Dana white because
Dana White was in here and Danny,

1267
01:14:56,730 --> 01:15:00,300
Danny used to be a boxer and Dana was
talking about his gambling like Dana

1268
01:15:00,301 --> 01:15:04,020
gambles, like insanity. He
wants 7,000,001 night. What?

1269
01:15:04,230 --> 01:15:05,310
He lost a million.

1270
01:15:06,540 --> 01:15:09,720
That's the most he's ever
lost is 1 million the most
he's ever won a 7 million.

1271
01:15:09,750 --> 01:15:12,210
And it's gambling always
on like on sporting events.

1272
01:15:12,240 --> 01:15:14,220
That's where he likes to gamble on it.
I don't know what the,

1273
01:15:14,221 --> 01:15:19,020
I think he's playing cards.
He's won $7 million. Yes, yes.

1274
01:15:20,220 --> 01:15:21,053
Yeah.

1275
01:15:21,100 --> 01:15:25,210
I can't even remember. I mean he, he
goes off because it poker, I don't know.

1276
01:15:25,211 --> 01:15:29,410
I think he plays blackjack. I don't
know what the fuck you play. Blackjack.

1277
01:15:29,680 --> 01:15:32,960
I went into that a high stakes room.
Uh,

1278
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:37,810
once I saw a guy and people stopped
or to watch him to do blackjack,

1279
01:15:37,811 --> 01:15:41,350
he was doing 10,000 a hand and we were
all like to see and Grantland and they

1280
01:15:41,351 --> 01:15:46,120
were like, no, like bust, take 10,000.
He would put 10,000 in chips back there.

1281
01:15:46,121 --> 01:15:49,890
And it was, I mean it was super
entertaining to watch, but I was like, oh,

1282
01:15:49,960 --> 01:15:51,370
I can't imagine doing that man.

1283
01:15:51,550 --> 01:15:55,360
I can't get out just talking about
10,000 and it goes like that.

1284
01:15:55,361 --> 01:15:58,180
I mean it has gone in seconds
and so Dana must do it.

1285
01:15:58,181 --> 01:16:00,940
That style where it's like 25
grand a hand, that kind of,

1286
01:16:01,180 --> 01:16:06,010
Oh yeah, that's a, that's
really unique with gambling.

1287
01:16:06,460 --> 01:16:11,460
You know the gambling for like money like
in Vegas type gambling is that you can

1288
01:16:11,831 --> 01:16:16,570
the the, it can shift within
seconds, seconds easy. If
you're gambling on a game,

1289
01:16:16,690 --> 01:16:20,350
it's a whole game. You have one
hour for this game to take place.

1290
01:16:20,680 --> 01:16:24,700
I kind of like gambling on games cause
I don't even like sports but if I had

1291
01:16:24,701 --> 01:16:28,060
some money invested, yeah, like it would
make it more exciting. It absolutely does.

1292
01:16:28,061 --> 01:16:31,870
It has that effect to the umpteenth
degree. It's like if I go to Vegas,

1293
01:16:31,910 --> 01:16:35,350
I'm like say say if you and I went and
there was some kickbox and going on

1294
01:16:35,560 --> 01:16:40,000
because they're doing this new thing
for a spike TV. Yeah. Glory. Glory.

1295
01:16:40,001 --> 01:16:42,760
Is this a super high
level kickboxing league?

1296
01:16:42,990 --> 01:16:46,380
It's like the best kick boxers on the
planet earth and the fucking, the,

1297
01:16:46,390 --> 01:16:50,140
the fights are incredible.
Like go con Saki and Daniel,

1298
01:16:50,141 --> 01:16:54,100
Geeta and Tyro and Splunk's guys
are fucking assassins. Right.

1299
01:16:54,490 --> 01:16:58,110
I would like to go see that Shit live and
if we went to see that shit live, yeah,

1300
01:16:58,360 --> 01:16:59,620
and we were ringside,
you know,

1301
01:16:59,621 --> 01:17:03,040
we're going to bet some
money Tommy buttons now would
you bet based not knowing

1302
01:17:03,041 --> 01:17:07,000
anything about the guys, how, you know,
I would never do that. He would pay.

1303
01:17:07,001 --> 01:17:10,720
What if I wanted it for a goof? Yeah.
No, but let's say not for like if you,

1304
01:17:10,721 --> 01:17:12,980
if we're talking about this particular,
would you know about the guy?

1305
01:17:12,990 --> 01:17:16,340
Like do you know those guys who they are?
Yeah, the high, the highest level guys.

1306
01:17:16,341 --> 01:17:19,430
I know, but there's so many more
kickboxers than there are MMA guys.

1307
01:17:19,431 --> 01:17:22,090
There's a lot of MMA guys that,
I don't know really. There's,

1308
01:17:22,140 --> 01:17:25,980
there's a certain number where you can
only keep so many in your brain. Yeah.

1309
01:17:26,030 --> 01:17:27,830
You know that there's,

1310
01:17:28,130 --> 01:17:31,460
like they say like close friends or
people that you're in contact with on a

1311
01:17:31,461 --> 01:17:36,200
regular basis. You have 150 names that
you can kind of keep going. Yeah. Yeah.

1312
01:17:36,350 --> 01:17:39,830
The 150 people that you have
relations with, everything after that,

1313
01:17:39,831 --> 01:17:42,890
it's just like, yeah. You know,
I don't know, have a lot of,

1314
01:17:43,460 --> 01:17:48,410
I mean like you in particular store
a lot of data about guys fighting who

1315
01:17:48,411 --> 01:17:51,440
they've fought and you remember the
fight where they fought, how the,

1316
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:56,390
how he won that particular fight.
That's a lot of extra knowledge. Yeah.

1317
01:17:56,750 --> 01:17:59,870
There. But that's because there's
nothing else in there. Right.

1318
01:17:59,960 --> 01:18:03,190
There's no other sports in there. Oh I
see what you mean. Yeah. You know. Yeah.

1319
01:18:03,200 --> 01:18:07,550
There's no room, there's no
room for hockey. There's no
room for basketball. Yeah.

1320
01:18:07,610 --> 01:18:11,000
So all like when I start talking
about like fights, like Oh, you know,

1321
01:18:11,001 --> 01:18:14,480
he lost Igov Chan Chan and he got
killed in the first round, came back,

1322
01:18:14,481 --> 01:18:18,260
fought a few times, but we never really
saw him again. I, you know, there's no,

1323
01:18:18,261 --> 01:18:20,420
there's no basketball in their confusing.
I see what you mean.

1324
01:18:20,450 --> 01:18:23,780
Cause I'm kind of that to a degree
that way with college football. Like,

1325
01:18:23,810 --> 01:18:27,440
I have a lot of data in there and I
remember names and I remember games and I

1326
01:18:27,441 --> 01:18:31,640
remember the year. But that's way more
numbers in the crazy thing is like,

1327
01:18:32,020 --> 01:18:36,290
well sometimes I'm amazed that I
remember who recruited the guy. Whoa.

1328
01:18:36,380 --> 01:18:38,880
And what high school he
went to the whole migration.

1329
01:18:39,170 --> 01:18:42,860
That's a hunter s Thompson's famous
story about, uh, talking to Nixon.

1330
01:18:43,610 --> 01:18:48,210
Have you ever heard that? No, I don't
think so. I don't think so. Oh Dude. Um,

1331
01:18:48,380 --> 01:18:51,320
he spent time in a car with Nixon.
Really?

1332
01:18:51,321 --> 01:18:56,150
Hunter s Thompson did before
he was president? No, Nixon
was president. Oh Wow.

1333
01:18:56,151 --> 01:18:56,984
Okay. And he, uh,

1334
01:18:56,990 --> 01:19:01,910
he rode with him in a car and a Nixon
and him just talked football. He,

1335
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:04,760
he knew that hunter was a football
fan. Right. Your ride with me.

1336
01:19:04,761 --> 01:19:08,920
If we only talk football because football
fans love to talk football with other

1337
01:19:08,930 --> 01:19:12,020
football fans. And the runner
was a huge football plant fan.

1338
01:19:12,140 --> 01:19:15,710
So he got in the backseat with Nixon
and they talked about football.

1339
01:19:15,711 --> 01:19:20,150
He said he was amazed that like he knew
about one guy who played one year with

1340
01:19:20,151 --> 01:19:24,200
one team and he knew where he went to
college and he let us, he was like,

1341
01:19:24,201 --> 01:19:26,880
I was blown away. It's like
he's a real legit, he goes,

1342
01:19:27,460 --> 01:19:31,520
it might be the only thing that he
didn't lie about it didn't hunter killed

1343
01:19:31,521 --> 01:19:34,310
himself after football season.
It was right. He was like,

1344
01:19:34,311 --> 01:19:36,660
he waited for like Superbowl and all
that and kills like in February or

1345
01:19:36,670 --> 01:19:39,560
something. He had been apparently talking
about killing himself for a long time.

1346
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:44,540
He was in some pretty serious pain. He
had hip replacements and a on top of it,

1347
01:19:44,630 --> 01:19:48,230
the boozing and the coke.
He had just red lined his brain.

1348
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:50,810
If you ever listen to a
hunter like later in life,

1349
01:19:51,470 --> 01:19:55,520
pull up a hunter s Thompson
on Conan O'brien show.

1350
01:19:55,820 --> 01:19:56,930
It's really sad.

1351
01:19:57,140 --> 01:20:00,320
And this is coming from someone
who's a huge hunter s Thompson Fan.

1352
01:20:00,321 --> 01:20:05,270
And so in fact, my favorite all
time documentary if I have to do it,

1353
01:20:05,750 --> 01:20:10,440
if I have to tell people one is a goof,
I always go with grizzly man.

1354
01:20:10,441 --> 01:20:12,720
Cause Christina was hilarious to me.
Do you mean could it,

1355
01:20:12,780 --> 01:20:17,600
do you mean a Letterman would I
sent Conan? Yeah. No, Conan. Conan.

1356
01:20:17,780 --> 01:20:22,620
If there's one, trust me, cause
he's, it's much, he's much older.

1357
01:20:22,770 --> 01:20:25,500
When he's doing the one on Conan
grizzly man, you'd find hysterical.

1358
01:20:25,501 --> 01:20:28,980
It's hilarious. I love it. I watched it
again last week, once it a hundred times.

1359
01:20:29,310 --> 01:20:33,690
But Gonzo, the life and work of Dr.
Hunter s Thompson is fucking brilliant.

1360
01:20:33,810 --> 01:20:36,720
Really. It's an amazing, amazing,
I miss your watch documentary.

1361
01:20:36,980 --> 01:20:39,990
I should watch that. They, that
you can't find a dude. There we go.

1362
01:20:40,350 --> 01:20:42,810
Hunter s Thompson. Is
this a bad copy? We're,

1363
01:20:42,820 --> 01:20:45,080
can we give you better
listen to him talk and talk.

1364
01:20:47,090 --> 01:20:48,190
You barely understand them.

1365
01:20:51,550 --> 01:20:52,710
Good.
Good.

1366
01:20:53,480 --> 01:20:56,380
You can't even hear that. Go. Go to
the one where they're at the desk.

1367
01:20:56,381 --> 01:21:00,680
If you go further, further
back, he's sitting at the
desk with Conan and he's, uh,

1368
01:21:00,740 --> 01:21:04,380
they're talking and it's like Jesus
Christ. You can't put together the saying,

1369
01:21:04,450 --> 01:21:09,040
you don't understand a word he's
saying, mumble slur, mumble, mumble,

1370
01:21:09,041 --> 01:21:13,870
mumble. But then if you go back to his
early stuff, you go back to, uh, the, the,

1371
01:21:13,871 --> 01:21:18,340
the documentary. It's absolutely
brilliant. It's when he's
running for sheriff, uh,

1372
01:21:18,341 --> 01:21:21,850
Avastin and, um, they start, you know,

1373
01:21:21,851 --> 01:21:26,140
he starts talking about the laws that are
in place today and why it's a gendered,

1374
01:21:26,141 --> 01:21:30,730
this disrespect for law enforcement
operators, uh, law enforcement officers,

1375
01:21:30,731 --> 01:21:34,150
because they know that these laws,
especially marijuana laws are bullshit.

1376
01:21:34,390 --> 01:21:36,970
Cops know they're bullshit. The kids are
on their bullshit. Yeah. And he was like,

1377
01:21:36,971 --> 01:21:37,091
you know,

1378
01:21:37,091 --> 01:21:39,880
we got to put a stop to this or there's
going to be a revolution in this country

1379
01:21:40,120 --> 01:21:42,820
and you know, and they're like,
it's pretty fucking intense, man.

1380
01:21:44,160 --> 01:21:47,680
Yeah. He does a shot. Throw up.

1381
01:21:53,870 --> 01:21:58,470
Hello. It's like, that was
pretty good. That's beautiful.

1382
01:21:59,180 --> 01:22:00,013
Horrible trick.

1383
01:22:04,580 --> 01:22:07,910
That was good. Very good. I to
come live with you for a month,

1384
01:22:08,440 --> 01:22:11,450
maybe umbrella some whiskey
and we need a machine gun.

1385
01:22:13,710 --> 01:22:18,530
Did you remembering we fired
this? Yeah. In Arizona.

1386
01:22:18,531 --> 01:22:19,370
That was awesome.

1387
01:22:20,980 --> 01:22:25,030
I went to the Arizona gun club is called
Phoenix gun club. Something like that.

1388
01:22:25,050 --> 01:22:25,883
Yeah.

1389
01:22:26,590 --> 01:22:29,300
It's amazing. Those
things aren't sane. Yeah.

1390
01:22:29,350 --> 01:22:33,800
We fired some crazy ass machine
guns. They're fun, man. Yeah,

1391
01:22:34,100 --> 01:22:36,710
we're shooting it. Some I need to
get a place where I can shoot guns.

1392
01:22:36,770 --> 01:22:39,280
That's what I need next.
It's so much fun to shoot a high power.

1393
01:22:39,281 --> 01:22:41,660
But the problem is whenever you get a
big piece of land that you could shoot

1394
01:22:41,661 --> 01:22:45,490
guns on the assume you're starting to call
it. Yeah. You know, what are they doing?

1395
01:22:45,510 --> 01:22:50,060
Well they go up there and they just shoot
guns. Yeah, but in California they do.

1396
01:22:50,180 --> 01:22:52,550
And then sometimes there's stuff
that you need to shoot with a gun,

1397
01:22:52,551 --> 01:22:53,840
which is another problem.
You know,

1398
01:22:53,960 --> 01:22:57,650
I don't want to go to Ohio and they
think I'm gay. Why? Cause the number one,

1399
01:22:58,070 --> 01:23:01,730
look what if number one now if all of a
sudden I start moving there, you know,

1400
01:23:02,660 --> 01:23:04,310
it's Kinda weird that you
guys are both Columbus.

1401
01:23:04,340 --> 01:23:09,340
Well there's more in basements to
fucking in Ohio. Easy too sweet.

1402
01:23:09,341 --> 01:23:09,940
Is it a,

1403
01:23:09,940 --> 01:23:14,260
is it a prison type thing where there's
just not as many girls and I don't know.

1404
01:23:14,380 --> 01:23:17,770
Is that what goes down now? It's
go creepy. I think those guys,

1405
01:23:17,771 --> 01:23:20,260
they would find you guys irresistible.
Smart.

1406
01:23:20,261 --> 01:23:22,660
They figured how to start their
own community in West Hollywood.

1407
01:23:22,780 --> 01:23:25,090
They figured out how to start
their own community in Columbus.

1408
01:23:25,630 --> 01:23:28,420
You know what doesn't happen
like that though? Lesbians.

1409
01:23:28,450 --> 01:23:32,230
Lesbians don't really form me very many
lesbian neighborhoods. I guess not.

1410
01:23:32,260 --> 01:23:36,010
I don't really think of, I
don't know. Right. I don't
even know if one, not really.

1411
01:23:36,011 --> 01:23:40,180
I can't think of one word. I'm sure
they exist. Yeah. I can't think of one.

1412
01:23:40,500 --> 01:23:43,760
Gay people have a whole
islands. Fire Island. Yeah.

1413
01:23:44,860 --> 01:23:49,060
Take over New York. It's almost all gay
fire Ireland is, yeah, it's gay. It's all,

1414
01:23:49,070 --> 01:23:50,670
it's like 98% gay.
Yeah,

1415
01:23:50,680 --> 01:23:54,640
and then there's a few hangers on some
old people that don't know what's up. Oh,

1416
01:23:54,641 --> 01:23:56,530
the strange.

1417
01:23:56,540 --> 01:24:01,210
They Russell Lesbians have the
dinosaur get together, right? Oh, well,

1418
01:24:01,211 --> 01:24:05,590
there's a lot of lesbian golf club pros
for sure. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. What else?

1419
01:24:05,920 --> 01:24:10,270
Pool. Really? Yes. High level
women, professional pool players.

1420
01:24:10,330 --> 01:24:15,040
A lot of gay softball, softball, but
a few really softball. Oh yeah. Yeah.

1421
01:24:15,041 --> 01:24:17,800
What is it about girls and
sports doesn't make them gay?

1422
01:24:18,130 --> 01:24:20,680
I guess there's the natural association,
right.

1423
01:24:20,930 --> 01:24:23,620
I know those girls all over the
country to think we're serious. I know.

1424
01:24:27,870 --> 01:24:30,040
I mean, you look like a guy
and you play like a guy.

1425
01:24:30,070 --> 01:24:34,420
That's not what we're saying first.
You can without a doubt, absolutely.

1426
01:24:34,720 --> 01:24:37,120
Be a beautiful woman and be in a sports.
Sure.

1427
01:24:37,180 --> 01:24:40,120
And doing sports and competing in sports.
Don't get me wrong,

1428
01:24:40,180 --> 01:24:44,860
I saw Gabby Reese at the airport. Whoa.
That's a lot of woman. Whoa. I did a, um,

1429
01:24:45,180 --> 01:24:49,300
a celebrity volleyball game with
her and Jonathan Taylor Thomas,

1430
01:24:50,530 --> 01:24:55,480
that's his favorite way back in
the, does a, yeah, it was many,

1431
01:24:55,481 --> 01:25:00,190
many, many moons ago. And uh,
she's big beautiful woman. Yeah.

1432
01:25:00,480 --> 01:25:02,710
Making fucking warrior
babies with that absolute,

1433
01:25:02,711 --> 01:25:06,220
her husband's a big beautiful
man layer. Additional surfer. Oh,

1434
01:25:06,221 --> 01:25:10,360
he looks like rock right out of a
fucking 1950s movie above the beach of

1435
01:25:10,361 --> 01:25:14,470
California hairs. Like amazing. Yep.
Down and you people are fucking yoked.

1436
01:25:14,471 --> 01:25:18,340
Big yoked. Beautiful Man. Yeah. The
two of them have pretty sex. Oh,

1437
01:25:18,470 --> 01:25:22,230
I'm sure it's, they should study it.
Yeah. They should study it. And like,

1438
01:25:22,480 --> 01:25:26,190
you know one day when they invent
artificial people, what do you want to be?

1439
01:25:26,191 --> 01:25:29,320
You want to be some artificial frail
little fucking insect like person.

1440
01:25:29,380 --> 01:25:31,530
I want to be layered,
layered and Gabriela.

1441
01:25:33,860 --> 01:25:35,860
She gives birth.

1442
01:25:35,890 --> 01:25:40,420
She probably just reaches in and
grabs the kid strongly. Fh Is,

1443
01:25:40,540 --> 01:25:42,820
oh my God, she doesn't have
to screen and they're both,

1444
01:25:42,850 --> 01:25:46,780
they're both loves it in their and
in their forties and they look,

1445
01:25:47,590 --> 01:25:50,040
they were together. They had
the whole family together
so I was like, he's fairly,

1446
01:25:50,041 --> 01:25:53,020
it looks amazing.
It was straight out of a magazine.

1447
01:25:57,310 --> 01:26:01,090
Did you hear that? You got herpes
infected monkeys in Florida. I believe it.

1448
01:26:01,091 --> 01:26:04,040
I was there this weekend. Yo,
Dude, Florida does not play games.

1449
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:07,610
Tommy bonds by the way,
developed in Florida. It's true.

1450
01:26:07,611 --> 01:26:12,611
It's one of the few things besides
herpes infected monkeys that have come

1451
01:26:12,891 --> 01:26:17,180
straight from Florida. Tommy Vaughn says,
right high school, Vero Beach, Florida.

1452
01:26:17,260 --> 01:26:18,093
I don't know.

1453
01:26:18,470 --> 01:26:23,180
They said that there's a fucking
slew of herpes infected wild monkeys.

1454
01:26:23,181 --> 01:26:25,190
There's as many as a third
of a thousand of them.

1455
01:26:25,310 --> 01:26:28,250
Then he adds a thousand of them.
There's going to be spreading a lot.

1456
01:26:28,280 --> 01:26:31,280
There's a lot of fucking going
on in the monkey world. Yeah.

1457
01:26:31,281 --> 01:26:33,290
Monkeys don't stop
monkeys on ask each other.

1458
01:26:33,291 --> 01:26:36,350
Do you have anything I should
know about before they, fuck they,

1459
01:26:36,380 --> 01:26:39,860
that's 100% of herpes. They
fuck everybody. Yeah, of course.

1460
01:26:40,460 --> 01:26:42,020
Every monkey fucks every monkey.

1461
01:26:42,260 --> 01:26:46,130
The only thing that they don't do is
we'll chimps at least as mother and son

1462
01:26:46,220 --> 01:26:49,910
don't have sex.
That's common primate restriction though.

1463
01:26:49,950 --> 01:26:53,320
The mother won't have sex with the
son, but the dad, everybody else,

1464
01:26:53,370 --> 01:26:56,210
the dad fucks the sun. Really?
Everybody fucks everybody.

1465
01:26:56,211 --> 01:26:58,910
They fucked the dad fucks the
daughters that they fucked cousins.

1466
01:26:58,911 --> 01:27:01,950
If fuck sisters, everybody fucks
everybody except the mom won't fuck this.

1467
01:27:02,330 --> 01:27:07,130
Very interesting. Thanks
mom. Yeah, this is,

1468
01:27:07,131 --> 01:27:10,370
uh, well, I mean it's just really
funny. How many endangered,

1469
01:27:10,790 --> 01:27:14,360
how many dangerous invasive
species there are in Florida?

1470
01:27:14,540 --> 01:27:17,210
When you stopped to think about it,
they started to find Nile crocodiles.

1471
01:27:17,870 --> 01:27:22,050
They found pythons that are so big.
They eat alligators. Jesus. Yeah.

1472
01:27:22,340 --> 01:27:27,320
And now they're finding these fucking
crazy herpes. He infected monkeys.

1473
01:27:27,470 --> 01:27:31,100
There's a thousand feral rhesus
monkeys living in Florida right now.

1474
01:27:31,101 --> 01:27:34,640
And among those scooped up by
wildlife officials over the years,

1475
01:27:34,760 --> 01:27:39,760
most were found to be carriers of herpes
B and this week the colony was declared

1476
01:27:40,521 --> 01:27:42,020
a public health hazard.

1477
01:27:42,530 --> 01:27:46,910
It's believed that a small handful of
the wild animals originally landed in the

1478
01:27:46,911 --> 01:27:49,730
state and the 1930s
courtesy of colonel toony,

1479
01:27:49,970 --> 01:27:54,680
a tour operator who wanted to give the
visitors a Tarzan inspired experience of

1480
01:27:54,681 --> 01:27:57,920
Florida's Silver River State Park too.

1481
01:27:57,921 --> 01:28:01,070
We reportedly kept the monkey
sequestered on an island,

1482
01:28:01,071 --> 01:28:04,220
but they learned to swim to shore.
Wow.

1483
01:28:04,250 --> 01:28:07,010
Easily reaching the
mainland and moving out,

1484
01:28:07,280 --> 01:28:11,810
putting down roots as far as Jackson
Ville over a hundred miles away.

1485
01:28:12,740 --> 01:28:16,060
This is amazing. And these are, these

1486
01:28:17,840 --> 01:28:19,730
are they,
they're not even contained,

1487
01:28:19,760 --> 01:28:22,940
like they're just out roaming
around or they're contained.

1488
01:28:24,450 --> 01:28:27,680
They're roaming.
There's a thousand of them roaming Jesus.

1489
01:28:27,710 --> 01:28:31,610
It says herpes doesn't cause serious
symptoms in these particular animals.

1490
01:28:31,820 --> 01:28:33,800
In fact,
it's fairly common amongst them,

1491
01:28:34,070 --> 01:28:39,070
but in humans it can lead to neurological
impairment or fatal in Cephalonia

1492
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:44,030
Mope, Sef, flow, my late, my likeness,

1493
01:28:44,120 --> 01:28:46,310
and Cephalon my Linus.
Why do they do that?

1494
01:28:46,520 --> 01:28:48,620
Why did they insist on making
it work so fucking difficult?

1495
01:28:49,150 --> 01:28:53,170
That shit's ridiculous. These
moments in sef a low, definitely.

1496
01:28:53,240 --> 01:28:57,710
I Litas lettuce,
my lightest.

1497
01:28:57,880 --> 01:28:59,750
I guess it's lettuce. No, it would be I,

1498
01:28:59,751 --> 01:29:02,310
because there's no e
after tea before and I,

1499
01:29:02,940 --> 01:29:07,530
or is there an inflammation of the
brain and spinal cord leading to death?

1500
01:29:07,590 --> 01:29:11,100
Florida's rhesus monkeys are known
to act aggressively towards people.

1501
01:29:11,130 --> 01:29:13,740
They're racist. They're biting
people. Yeah, they're probably racist.

1502
01:29:14,360 --> 01:29:16,650
They probably hate white people.
So they bite people and then you get,

1503
01:29:16,680 --> 01:29:20,970
you get a murderous form of
herpes that barely affects them,

1504
01:29:21,240 --> 01:29:25,140
barely affects them, but will kill you.
This is so, they are essentially toxic.

1505
01:29:25,470 --> 01:29:29,820
It's mean, it's very little difference
between that, having that and being toxic.

1506
01:29:29,840 --> 01:29:30,421
Yeah.
I mean,

1507
01:29:30,421 --> 01:29:33,450
you're talking about something that you
can give a person that will fuck them up.

1508
01:29:33,900 --> 01:29:36,100
It's me. Well, how's that
different than a poison? Hey Miss,

1509
01:29:36,101 --> 01:29:40,560
because it's a bacteria. Great winters
in Florida. Just all I got to say. Yeah.

1510
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:45,180
There's a Cuban treefrog
problem in, uh, in Florida too.

1511
01:29:45,710 --> 01:29:50,280
They're, uh, they're really
noisy. So these animals,

1512
01:29:50,310 --> 01:29:55,310
they move into these areas and the people
like have a real hard time sleeping.

1513
01:29:56,790 --> 01:30:01,410
Oh, she's, because they're really,
really fucking loud and they're,

1514
01:30:01,440 --> 01:30:04,140
they're trying to find out
like one of the research,

1515
01:30:04,141 --> 01:30:07,560
some of the research that we're doing
recently in human beings and happiness and

1516
01:30:07,561 --> 01:30:10,830
harmony and peace. One of the things
they're showing is that we need quiet.

1517
01:30:11,370 --> 01:30:14,550
Like people need quiet. It's not
just, I would like to get some quiet.

1518
01:30:14,730 --> 01:30:19,170
Now you actually do need certain amounts
of quiet. You can't, you, you need sleep.

1519
01:30:19,290 --> 01:30:21,810
And during that sleep you
need to be able to rest.

1520
01:30:21,900 --> 01:30:24,540
And if you're fucking constantly
inundated with sounds,

1521
01:30:24,690 --> 01:30:26,220
you might not ever totally rest.

1522
01:30:26,420 --> 01:30:31,420
You might drift in and out or [inaudible]
they could fucking red line your mind.

1523
01:30:31,471 --> 01:30:36,190
It can really fuck you up. So these
frogs, they move in their, their culture.

1524
01:30:36,240 --> 01:30:40,890
Cuban tree flogs there in tree frogs
there in central and south Florida.

1525
01:30:41,880 --> 01:30:46,230
And they're there.
They double the rate of their calls.

1526
01:30:47,430 --> 01:30:51,510
Native Green Tree frogs. Dot. Hmm. Oh,

1527
01:30:51,511 --> 01:30:53,610
in the presence of this is so crazy.

1528
01:30:53,790 --> 01:30:57,150
They're so loud that in
the presence of them,

1529
01:30:57,151 --> 01:31:00,570
the native frogs have doubled
their rate of calls as well.

1530
01:31:00,840 --> 01:31:04,410
So it's just insanity.
They're super loud and crazy.

1531
01:31:04,560 --> 01:31:07,950
And then the other frogs have doubled
their rate of calls because they have to

1532
01:31:07,951 --> 01:31:11,790
try to keep up with these crazy new,
they're basically Joey Diaz as a frog.

1533
01:31:12,270 --> 01:31:17,220
It's a big, loud, crazy Cuban
frog. That's insane. Yeah.

1534
01:31:17,221 --> 01:31:20,490
That's nuts.
They have unforeseen ecological effects,

1535
01:31:20,550 --> 01:31:24,900
Tennessee and says that by doubling it's
called rate the green frog makes its

1536
01:31:24,901 --> 01:31:29,490
presence more obvious, which is likely
to make it more vulnerable to predation.

1537
01:31:30,330 --> 01:31:32,940
Wow. So they're going to kill off the
other frogs, but making them stupid

1538
01:31:34,680 --> 01:31:39,510
till they actually get, they got
competitive about, Yup. The frog calls,

1539
01:31:39,530 --> 01:31:42,840
they were like, yeah, well it makes
sense. Yeah, of course. It must be sexual.

1540
01:31:42,841 --> 01:31:45,330
Right when they, when they make
calls. What else are you doing?

1541
01:31:45,660 --> 01:31:49,950
Sexual or it's like territorial, you
know, about like threatening my territory.

1542
01:31:50,190 --> 01:31:54,210
Right. And what's the territory
about sex? I guess so, yeah.

1543
01:31:54,240 --> 01:31:58,650
They're just trying to get their frog
freak on fraud freaks. They found, uh,

1544
01:31:59,860 --> 01:32:04,860
the largest wild Burmese python in
Florida recently captured in euthanize the

1545
01:32:04,961 --> 01:32:08,770
for, this is the largest one they've
ever caught Florida 17 feet long.

1546
01:32:09,820 --> 01:32:11,560
Do you think a lot of this
stuff going there? I mean,

1547
01:32:11,920 --> 01:32:14,590
part of it is like that it's made up.

1548
01:32:14,591 --> 01:32:17,650
The place is a swamp like states a swamp,

1549
01:32:17,980 --> 01:32:22,980
but then it's also proximity to like
wear a lot of people end up going like

1550
01:32:23,830 --> 01:32:28,540
people from the islands, right. Coming up
with shit. It's the perfect storm. Yeah.

1551
01:32:28,570 --> 01:32:30,850
Florida is the perfect
storm. Yeah. First of all,

1552
01:32:30,940 --> 01:32:35,940
you've got the highest level of Oxycontin
addiction in prescription on the

1553
01:32:36,431 --> 01:32:41,320
planet earth. That's Florida. Florida has
10 times more oxycontin prescriptions.

1554
01:32:41,530 --> 01:32:46,330
Then the rest of the country
combined. Really? Yes.

1555
01:32:47,410 --> 01:32:51,880
That's a lot. So then,
okay, so you got that right.

1556
01:32:51,880 --> 01:32:54,940
You've got this crazy number of
people who are on Oxycontin's.

1557
01:32:55,390 --> 01:32:57,580
Then you've got Cuban immigrants,

1558
01:32:57,610 --> 01:33:00,610
including a slew that Castro released,

1559
01:33:00,840 --> 01:33:02,830
the Castro sent out because
they were prisoners.

1560
01:33:02,950 --> 01:33:04,600
That's what Scarface is based on.
Yeah.

1561
01:33:04,720 --> 01:33:08,170
Then you've got the cocaine industry
in my and mental patients too. Oh yeah.

1562
01:33:08,200 --> 01:33:12,930
Dan Marino, Dan Marines from Florida. Now
he's from, he's from, he was just, yeah,

1563
01:33:12,931 --> 01:33:16,810
he played for the Miami Dolphins.
Yeah. So you've got that. Okay.

1564
01:33:17,020 --> 01:33:20,890
Then you've got the amount of banks that
were set up with cocaine money. Whoa.

1565
01:33:20,891 --> 01:33:23,440
Jesus. That's, that's when you
start getting really crazy. Yes.

1566
01:33:23,540 --> 01:33:25,780
Because you find the numbers and
you go, oh my God, this is insane.

1567
01:33:25,781 --> 01:33:26,800
Why there's so many banks.

1568
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,800
There's more banks per capita in Miami
than anywhere else in the country.

1569
01:33:30,190 --> 01:33:34,270
Then you got no state income tax. What
type does that attract? And no income tax.

1570
01:33:34,630 --> 01:33:37,160
And it's like this reputation
of being a place where he,

1571
01:33:37,161 --> 01:33:40,870
eastern gangsters went south.
I mean it's always been there.

1572
01:33:40,900 --> 01:33:45,220
Like they go south and dumped bodies.
They go south and hide out. That goes,

1573
01:33:45,221 --> 01:33:47,530
I mean they would get in a Cadillac
and they would drive from New York to

1574
01:33:47,531 --> 01:33:50,590
Florida. I'm going to give my mother
a nice house in Florida. Yeah.

1575
01:33:50,800 --> 01:33:51,790
And then they would also,

1576
01:33:51,791 --> 01:33:56,791
the big thing before Florida was they
would take boats or jets or whatever to

1577
01:33:56,861 --> 01:34:00,010
Cuba.
Before Cuba fell like in the 1950s.

1578
01:34:00,011 --> 01:34:03,440
Like Kennedy would go to Cuba and that
was the spot. They would go to Cuba,

1579
01:34:03,441 --> 01:34:04,390
but people go to Cuba.

1580
01:34:04,391 --> 01:34:08,540
Cuba was the shit they would
go and dance and drink and,

1581
01:34:08,840 --> 01:34:10,690
and it was supposed to
be fucking incredible.

1582
01:34:11,080 --> 01:34:13,630
And then when the shit hit the
fan and everybody had a flea,

1583
01:34:14,410 --> 01:34:17,320
let's just stay around Miami.
Fuck it. Going to need to go here.

1584
01:34:17,380 --> 01:34:22,380
And Miami's basically is nothing about
it looks like any American city at all.

1585
01:34:23,670 --> 01:34:28,570
It's totally, I mean it's great
time. He's a great city. It's a fun,

1586
01:34:28,571 --> 01:34:33,430
fun city. But it's very international.
Oh yeah. It's very international.

1587
01:34:33,490 --> 01:34:37,030
You are an asshole sometimes when you
walk into a store there and speak English,

1588
01:34:37,031 --> 01:34:40,720
just like they literally are like,
who the fuck are you doing?

1589
01:34:41,470 --> 01:34:44,560
So there's that, you
know, and then there's,

1590
01:34:44,590 --> 01:34:49,590
it's attached to the southerly
parts of what Georgia and what else,

1591
01:34:50,650 --> 01:34:55,150
what else is it attached to drive to
South Carolina? No, Alabama. Yeah,

1592
01:34:55,151 --> 01:34:59,450
there you go.
You Go Bama,

1593
01:34:59,990 --> 01:35:03,140
Mississippi. And it's
interesting because the, uh,

1594
01:35:03,170 --> 01:35:06,710
the other thing that's interesting
is that the further south you go,

1595
01:35:06,950 --> 01:35:11,950
the more international cosmopolitan
when you're in like northern Florida,

1596
01:35:12,410 --> 01:35:16,520
northern Florida, you might as well be
an Alabama. Oh, definitely. You really,

1597
01:35:16,610 --> 01:35:20,750
you don't have to go that far
north. No, no. You're that
far central. No, you do not.

1598
01:35:20,930 --> 01:35:25,790
Yeah. Northern forest tree yet
it's a different out Tallahassee,

1599
01:35:26,060 --> 01:35:29,450
that shit's country.
I remember when when I was in high school.

1600
01:35:29,460 --> 01:35:32,400
Cool. And we would go to this
place called Belle glade.

1601
01:35:33,210 --> 01:35:38,130
Belle glade is basically
inland from Palm Beach. I,

1602
01:35:38,140 --> 01:35:42,030
so palm beach is billionaire's row,
right?

1603
01:35:42,180 --> 01:35:46,260
West Palm Beach has nothing to do
with that. It's just, you know,

1604
01:35:46,440 --> 01:35:51,060
like poor and uh, you know, it has, I
mean obviously it has some nice areas,

1605
01:35:51,061 --> 01:35:54,720
but then you have like rednecks and then
you go further in that Lake Okeechobee.

1606
01:35:54,780 --> 01:35:58,840
Belle glade is sugarcane.
And you could smell yourself,

1607
01:35:58,860 --> 01:36:03,750
you could smell Belle glade way
before you get there. Like the draft,

1608
01:36:03,990 --> 01:36:08,010
like burning sugar cane and it
doesn't smell sweet, you know,

1609
01:36:08,011 --> 01:36:10,770
it doesn't smell good.
And you get out there and you're like,

1610
01:36:10,771 --> 01:36:13,260
this is like an entirely different world.

1611
01:36:13,770 --> 01:36:16,140
Like it had nothing to do with anything.

1612
01:36:16,141 --> 01:36:20,820
It was so rural and you know,
it was all about the soil there.

1613
01:36:20,821 --> 01:36:24,430
Mk City and, and the, uh, the,

1614
01:36:24,431 --> 01:36:29,431
the place had you would think you
were in Alabama or in Georgia,

1615
01:36:31,270 --> 01:36:33,870
you know, some rural part of Georgia.
And that was just like I said,

1616
01:36:33,871 --> 01:36:36,000
a couple of hours in from West Palm Beach

1617
01:36:36,310 --> 01:36:40,610
that, that cartoon of Bugs Bunny Song
off Florida. What year was that from?

1618
01:36:40,790 --> 01:36:44,030
Uh,
it looks like about six days.

1619
01:36:44,140 --> 01:36:47,880
Do you think that that was really what
he did or did someone create that to for

1620
01:36:47,881 --> 01:36:51,760
a joke and the new day and age? Oh
No, no, no. That's from a cartoon.

1621
01:36:51,940 --> 01:36:54,070
So he really did saw away
Florida. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

1622
01:36:54,310 --> 01:36:59,230
So was Florida where Elmer Fudd lived
and I can't remember that episode.

1623
01:36:59,780 --> 01:37:04,090
Hating on flow. Was Florida
shitty back then to where,

1624
01:37:04,091 --> 01:37:06,370
where did Lucy and Ricky live?
They live in Florida

1625
01:37:08,540 --> 01:37:13,100
cause he was Cuban, right? He was Cuban.
Was that Miami to question? I don't know.

1626
01:37:13,130 --> 01:37:14,330
I Love Lucy.
Here we go.

1627
01:37:16,040 --> 01:37:20,630
Isn't it funny that they're like no one
had any problem with that as like an

1628
01:37:20,631 --> 01:37:23,960
interracial relationship or, uh, you know,

1629
01:37:23,990 --> 01:37:26,900
inter cultural relationship.
Like back then,

1630
01:37:26,901 --> 01:37:30,050
like being a Cuban man was
like very sophisticated.

1631
01:37:30,410 --> 01:37:34,810
It wasn't like if you tried
to do a Mexican and her, like,

1632
01:37:35,230 --> 01:37:37,590
people would have a problem with
that. Yeah, it was, you know,

1633
01:37:37,610 --> 01:37:41,120
it was okay to have it that way.
It wasn't even considered. I mean,

1634
01:37:41,121 --> 01:37:44,510
not that they're different races,
but Hispanic,

1635
01:37:44,511 --> 01:37:46,180
a lot of people will actually all racist.

1636
01:37:46,181 --> 01:37:49,130
Do Look at Hispanic and Hispanic people.

1637
01:37:49,131 --> 01:37:52,460
It's being different than Hawaii
course of course. But that back then,

1638
01:37:54,330 --> 01:37:55,740
did you know that

1639
01:37:56,580 --> 01:38:01,260
big bunny bugs bunny?
Why did they do that?

1640
01:38:02,070 --> 01:38:05,600
Why is bugs metaphor and that's what I
need to know now. Do you know that a desi,

1641
01:38:05,610 --> 01:38:09,890
he had such a massive ego
that does Ernesto. Yeah.

1642
01:38:10,140 --> 01:38:14,970
He had a real problem with the name
of the show being an I love Lucy.

1643
01:38:15,480 --> 01:38:20,160
So they, he was like, the
show should be like, you know,

1644
01:38:20,550 --> 01:38:24,930
I love Desi. Right. But they told
him, yeah, but who sang? I Love Lucy.

1645
01:38:25,810 --> 01:38:28,890
I was saying he's an idiot. Yeah. And
they were like, and he was like, oh yeah.

1646
01:38:28,891 --> 01:38:32,400
And they convinced him. Oh my God. They're
showed, basically it's, it's, you sang it.

1647
01:38:32,550 --> 01:38:35,280
So the show's really about, you know,
how do we know that that's true though?

1648
01:38:35,310 --> 01:38:38,520
That's it. It's a, all these
stories of her duce or it could be,

1649
01:38:38,750 --> 01:38:40,720
it could be saying wad.
They'll tell us,

1650
01:38:40,750 --> 01:38:43,770
they'll tell stories about you
some day Tommy buttons and be like,

1651
01:38:43,771 --> 01:38:46,350
the fuck I said that.
I didn't fucking say that shit out.

1652
01:38:46,351 --> 01:38:49,350
Fuck I said that meanwhile.
Okay.

1653
01:38:50,100 --> 01:38:54,090
That was a big fucking popular show
him. Oh yeah. I think the most,

1654
01:38:54,150 --> 01:38:57,930
I think the most watched
episode of television ever is,

1655
01:38:57,931 --> 01:39:00,420
I love Lucy when she gave birth,

1656
01:39:00,480 --> 01:39:05,220
everybody tuned in to see if it was a
boy or a girl. Like it's crazy numbers,

1657
01:39:05,640 --> 01:39:09,810
insanity. Like basically most of our
country watch that. When that aired,

1658
01:39:10,080 --> 01:39:15,080
it was from six years from 1951 to
1957 and then after the series ended,

1659
01:39:15,990 --> 01:39:20,990
a modified version continued for three
more seasons with 13 one hour specials

1660
01:39:21,750 --> 01:39:25,770
running from 1957 in 1960. No, Nas,

1661
01:39:25,771 --> 01:39:27,000
the Lucille Ball,

1662
01:39:27,001 --> 01:39:32,001
Desi Arnaz show and then reruns
as the Lucy Dezi comedy hour.

1663
01:39:33,030 --> 01:39:38,010
My name is on that show. Loves that.
This is bullshit. I'm not coming back.

1664
01:39:38,790 --> 01:39:42,810
Yeah, I guess I was actually in
1949 that bugs bunny cartoon,

1665
01:39:43,260 --> 01:39:46,760
but I think he just, I dunno, he, um,

1666
01:39:47,190 --> 01:39:50,310
he's given credit basically
for syndication. Really?

1667
01:39:50,311 --> 01:39:54,900
Desi Arnaz he figured it out while he's
the one television used to just air

1668
01:39:54,901 --> 01:39:58,350
live. Like you just wow. And
they would just shoot it.

1669
01:39:58,440 --> 01:40:01,890
And then he asked for like the prince
one time and they were like, yeah,

1670
01:40:01,891 --> 01:40:04,020
you can have the fucking prince.
What are we going to do with that shit?

1671
01:40:05,400 --> 01:40:09,010
You fucking idiot. You dumb
Cuban piece of shit. And then,

1672
01:40:10,360 --> 01:40:13,020
and then woopsie little while
later he was like, well, you know,

1673
01:40:13,021 --> 01:40:16,260
we can repair this. And they were
like, Oh yeah, we could rear that.

1674
01:40:16,950 --> 01:40:19,140
That's actually quite funny.
Yeah.

1675
01:40:19,500 --> 01:40:22,080
Originally sat in an apartment
building in New York City.

1676
01:40:22,081 --> 01:40:26,730
I love Lucy centers on Lucy Ricardo,
Lucille ball, and her singer,

1677
01:40:26,731 --> 01:40:29,670
bandleader husband,
Ricky Ricardo

1678
01:40:31,230 --> 01:40:34,350
along with their best friends
and landlords. Fred Mertz,

1679
01:40:34,410 --> 01:40:39,000
the landlord and Ethel Mertz. Wow. Yeah.

1680
01:40:39,001 --> 01:40:41,670
That's shows those shows man,
like the honeymooners.

1681
01:40:41,880 --> 01:40:44,820
That's a window into
another time. Yeah, sure.

1682
01:40:44,950 --> 01:40:48,210
They watched and Lucille ball
watching the honeymooners,

1683
01:40:48,480 --> 01:40:50,190
the honeymooners every week.

1684
01:40:50,280 --> 01:40:52,890
Ralph Pram did with threatened
to beat the fuck out of his,

1685
01:40:54,950 --> 01:40:58,960
not just occasional. Yeah. Every
fucking week he would like.

1686
01:41:01,780 --> 01:41:05,710
He would talk about punching her in
the face and knocking her to the moon.

1687
01:41:07,130 --> 01:41:09,130
He deserved it but stopped.
Stop.

1688
01:41:09,140 --> 01:41:13,510
Just stop and think about like culturally
how crazy people were not that long

1689
01:41:13,511 --> 01:41:13,780
ago.

1690
01:41:13,780 --> 01:41:18,780
We need to understand what a giant
change has happened in our culture.

1691
01:41:20,030 --> 01:41:24,100
I think one of the best ways to really
document it is to watch old shows.

1692
01:41:24,670 --> 01:41:29,470
Watch what they, what they excepted back
then and watch it. They accept today.

1693
01:41:29,910 --> 01:41:34,910
There's a newspaper article I just
saw from somebody posted it I think on

1694
01:41:37,020 --> 01:41:39,360
Twitter and it was,

1695
01:41:40,560 --> 01:41:45,090
it was the ass they pulled guy. It was an
old newspaper article they pulled guys,

1696
01:41:45,091 --> 01:41:50,091
whether it's okay to spank
a woman and the answers,

1697
01:41:51,540 --> 01:41:55,260
they pulled like five or six guys. There's
an old article and they were all like,

1698
01:41:55,320 --> 01:41:57,020
absolutely like she
needs it and if she did,

1699
01:41:57,260 --> 01:41:59,660
if she's out of line and she
doesn't know she's doing,

1700
01:41:59,661 --> 01:42:00,920
you're just trying to help her.

1701
01:42:01,160 --> 01:42:03,400
And this was a newspaper thing where
they were like, see guys? Yeah.

1702
01:42:03,500 --> 01:42:07,400
It was to make you feel okay about
spanking yearly. I tweeted that. Oh,

1703
01:42:07,401 --> 01:42:09,850
you tweeted that? Yeah. Okay. I don't
know. I just saw an article. Well,

1704
01:42:09,970 --> 01:42:12,590
I might've retweeted it, but either
way I can definitely tweeted it.

1705
01:42:12,650 --> 01:42:16,310
I thought that was hilarious.
Hysterical. Yeah. If a woman needs it,

1706
01:42:16,370 --> 01:42:20,690
should she be spanked? The best part about
it was rich read it. Let's read. Yeah,

1707
01:42:20,691 --> 01:42:25,430
it's so fucking funny.
Why not? Jesus Christ.

1708
01:42:25,640 --> 01:42:28,400
If they don't know how to behave
by the time they're adults,

1709
01:42:28,430 --> 01:42:32,020
they should be treated like
children and spanked that automate,

1710
01:42:32,030 --> 01:42:35,480
make them grow up in a hurry.
If it doesn't at first,

1711
01:42:35,570 --> 01:42:40,070
they'll soon get the idea. This
is incredible. I get the idea.

1712
01:42:40,070 --> 01:42:43,490
I yes, when they deserve it. As a barber,

1713
01:42:43,610 --> 01:42:47,450
I've got a lot of faith in the hairbrush.
Oh my God.

1714
01:42:47,870 --> 01:42:52,850
I think there are certain cases
when it is advisable, when it is.

1715
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:56,120
There's no reason why you
shouldn't go right ahead and do it.

1716
01:42:56,360 --> 01:42:59,000
I can't knock the idea and my business,

1717
01:42:59,090 --> 01:43:04,090
a man sets a lot of the of store sets a
lot of store by the results he can get

1718
01:43:06,231 --> 01:43:09,440
with a hairbrush, properly
applied. Nice little smack.

1719
01:43:09,470 --> 01:43:12,050
Now here's the counterpoint though.
Sets a lot of store.

1720
01:43:12,080 --> 01:43:16,040
Maybe that's a business term back then,
man sets a lot of store.

1721
01:43:16,050 --> 01:43:18,140
Are you ready for the
counterpoint? Yes, there is none.

1722
01:43:18,200 --> 01:43:23,200
Everybody agrees that that's the best
part is everybody takes the point of view

1723
01:43:23,340 --> 01:43:27,530
because this guy parking lot attendant
from Brooklyn, you, Teddy Hillel, you bet.

1724
01:43:27,531 --> 01:43:29,960
You Bet.
It teaches them who's boss.

1725
01:43:30,380 --> 01:43:32,750
A lot of women tend to
forget this is a man's world.

1726
01:43:32,900 --> 01:43:37,160
And a lot of men who stepped down as
boss of a family wished they hadn't

1727
01:43:37,370 --> 01:43:41,690
spanking might help get back some of
the respect they lost. Look at Teddy.

1728
01:43:41,840 --> 01:43:45,500
Look at that as Joey
Diaz, his cousin. Listen,

1729
01:43:45,501 --> 01:43:48,980
cock sock that spank them if they want it.
William Davis,

1730
01:43:49,010 --> 01:43:52,130
what does Williamson as a
toy factory owner? Yes. Most

1731
01:43:52,130 --> 01:43:56,090
of them have it coming to them anyway.
If they don't,

1732
01:43:56,240 --> 01:43:58,670
it will remind them of
how well off they are.

1733
01:43:58,880 --> 01:44:03,560
I subscribe to the theory that an ounce
of prevention is worth a pound of cure.

1734
01:44:03,650 --> 01:44:07,580
Holy Shit. Look at him. Look
at that evil looking. Fuck.

1735
01:44:08,090 --> 01:44:10,730
It looks like Rutger house brother.
Wow.

1736
01:44:10,910 --> 01:44:15,380
Does he look like Rutger Hauer and
Robert Dinero? Fuck it looks evil.

1737
01:44:15,830 --> 01:44:18,710
That one. A Holtzman. Oh yeah,

1738
01:44:18,720 --> 01:44:21,440
he does a little like Holsman
imagine that guy spanking your wife.

1739
01:44:21,620 --> 01:44:26,510
Let's see what the other people. That
was the last one. Yep. That's awful.

1740
01:44:26,770 --> 01:44:31,410
Oh well that's sort of like what you know,
um,

1741
01:44:31,460 --> 01:44:35,660
Dawkins is kind of alluding to totally
that you're dealing with a totally

1742
01:44:35,661 --> 01:44:39,140
different time. Absolutely. And he
probably didn't really get over it. Yeah.

1743
01:44:39,170 --> 01:44:43,010
He's probably saying that to appear.
Look, it's no big deal. I got over it,

1744
01:44:43,220 --> 01:44:46,640
but the reality is, is that guy
probably needs mushrooms in a hug. Yeah.

1745
01:44:46,820 --> 01:44:49,310
That guy's still,
he's like avoided psychedelics.

1746
01:44:49,311 --> 01:44:51,640
You know where that came
into play big time with,

1747
01:44:51,641 --> 01:44:56,180
with that k like that specific world at,
um,

1748
01:44:56,540 --> 01:45:01,130
was an issue was the Joe Paterno
thing. Oh, okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1749
01:45:01,260 --> 01:45:04,550
Sandusky. Nobody's arguing that
it was a different era. He was,

1750
01:45:04,551 --> 01:45:06,170
he's a rapist and a pedophile.

1751
01:45:06,680 --> 01:45:11,680
But people were saying that the way
that paternal handled it was just an old

1752
01:45:13,041 --> 01:45:16,490
school guy way of doing it because
he was 80 something years old.

1753
01:45:17,060 --> 01:45:21,980
His whole thing was like, you know,
I didn't, I didn't know. And My,

1754
01:45:22,130 --> 01:45:22,700
uh,

1755
01:45:22,700 --> 01:45:27,630
my way of the way of doing things when
for a guy from his era was like, well,

1756
01:45:27,631 --> 01:45:30,800
just, you don't come around here anymore.
Yeah. You know what I mean? Yeah.

1757
01:45:30,980 --> 01:45:35,980
It was his way of his way of
policing that type of behavior was,

1758
01:45:36,980 --> 01:45:40,490
and that probably was what people would
do to somebody. Like, you hear what,

1759
01:45:41,300 --> 01:45:44,420
what Jerry did. Yeah. Jerry's not
welcome here anymore. You know,

1760
01:45:44,720 --> 01:45:48,670
that kind of thing. Yeah.
That's considered the
discipline for that guy. Right.

1761
01:45:48,700 --> 01:45:51,870
Not let's call authorities and,

1762
01:45:51,871 --> 01:45:55,130
and it was like [inaudible] you
know he's out of here. Yeah. Jerry,

1763
01:45:55,131 --> 01:45:59,000
you can't fuck my kids. Yeah. You gotta
go away. Stop. That's wrong. Yeah.

1764
01:45:59,090 --> 01:46:03,740
You can't come to the, to the cookouts
anymore. Jerry. Jerry's twisted.

1765
01:46:03,741 --> 01:46:08,100
Fuck. Yeah. Yeah. Um, one of
the things that Dawkins look,

1766
01:46:08,101 --> 01:46:11,230
get this guy spraying again. Let's
check. Oh, you know, acting up. Did we

1767
01:46:11,230 --> 01:46:15,870
join in? Wow. He's really beaten on
her man. Are they going to separate it?

1768
01:46:16,820 --> 01:46:19,080
Wow.
See what devil do you think you're doing?

1769
01:46:21,060 --> 01:46:25,140
He's drunk trying to grab the glass
and smell it while he's drunk.

1770
01:46:26,970 --> 01:46:30,460
Well, the grandmother thinks
that's funny. I'm just my own room.

1771
01:46:30,810 --> 01:46:35,140
The mother never been struck in
her whole life. Like go like,

1772
01:46:35,450 --> 01:46:38,690
Hi Dawn.
The grandmother's last time

1773
01:46:41,170 --> 01:46:43,590
I had to go,

1774
01:46:44,710 --> 01:46:49,030
come into my house and trying to tell
me what to do and hitting me. What?

1775
01:46:49,110 --> 01:46:51,720
Think of him parking. Tempt
you, but you're not, you're,

1776
01:46:56,390 --> 01:46:59,200
she didn't need to go there. She did. No,

1777
01:46:59,201 --> 01:47:03,130
she needed to get back to talking shit
about the guy being a clerk. Absolutely.

1778
01:47:03,440 --> 01:47:06,520
However, I forgot how much she
forgot how good she has a job.

1779
01:47:07,300 --> 01:47:08,133
He's got a good life.

1780
01:47:08,140 --> 01:47:11,420
That's so weird when you look at stuff
like that from another time and you go,

1781
01:47:11,430 --> 01:47:13,900
Whoa, that's not that
far ago. No. You know,

1782
01:47:13,901 --> 01:47:17,050
in terms of the amount of time
that human beings have been alive,

1783
01:47:17,080 --> 01:47:19,690
it's not that far. And in terms of
the life of the planet, you know,

1784
01:47:19,691 --> 01:47:22,390
obviously you get back further
and further and wider and wider.

1785
01:47:22,391 --> 01:47:26,350
It looks Tinier and Tinier. It's really
strange. Was that a guy getting spanked?

1786
01:47:26,351 --> 01:47:28,540
That's a girl. Wow. Wrestling.

1787
01:47:28,541 --> 01:47:32,090
They spank now she has
a very firm booty too,

1788
01:47:32,280 --> 01:47:35,150
but that was a fun spanking. This
guy's like, are not your baby.

1789
01:47:35,710 --> 01:47:36,760
Can't believe spanking my wife.

1790
01:47:37,660 --> 01:47:39,430
He's got to go back there
and why he's banging her.

1791
01:47:39,431 --> 01:47:41,470
She's going to close his eyes and
tell him about that guy spanking her.

1792
01:47:42,580 --> 01:47:46,540
That's so, wrestling is so silly. It's
such a silly, what are you talking about?

1793
01:47:46,541 --> 01:47:50,590
It's amazing. It's the best
thing we have. So it's so absurd.

1794
01:47:51,100 --> 01:47:54,820
It's pro wrestling, you don't mean real
wrestling weird, that real wrestling.

1795
01:47:54,910 --> 01:47:58,540
It's like one of the greatest fucking
sports, most difficult sports,

1796
01:47:58,541 --> 01:48:02,590
the world's ever known and super effective
in combat. But that fake wrestling.

1797
01:48:02,920 --> 01:48:07,570
So it's like there it is the uh,
front to American civilization.

1798
01:48:08,530 --> 01:48:12,280
It is the thing where if the aliens
come down and they turn on the TV of,

1799
01:48:12,281 --> 01:48:15,430
that's the first thing they watch.
You got a real problem on your hands.

1800
01:48:15,490 --> 01:48:17,080
And I get that. Like somebody
telling you, you know,

1801
01:48:17,081 --> 01:48:18,910
it's a soap opera for like basically

1802
01:48:19,020 --> 01:48:23,610
dude's yeah. And I'm like,
stop. I watch. I'm like, I like,

1803
01:48:24,060 --> 01:48:27,900
I almost, I understand the way
more for like a kid, you know,

1804
01:48:27,901 --> 01:48:29,850
the characters and all that stuff.
But yeah,

1805
01:48:30,210 --> 01:48:33,210
when I have adult friends,

1806
01:48:33,330 --> 01:48:35,970
I have a lot of adult friends that
all still watch it and love it.

1807
01:48:35,971 --> 01:48:37,150
Like Sam from opion,

1808
01:48:37,230 --> 01:48:40,890
Anthony fucking in love with it and
Tony Hinchcliffe and you're just like,

1809
01:48:40,891 --> 01:48:43,920
Hinchcliffe loves wrestling. He's one
of the biggest wrestler guys ever.

1810
01:48:44,070 --> 01:48:47,690
That is hilarious. I know
comic in Chicago, Marty Derosa

1811
01:48:47,840 --> 01:48:51,270
um,
fucking like talking about this shit.

1812
01:48:51,450 --> 01:48:54,690
Like did you see that shit?
What are you talking about man?

1813
01:48:55,380 --> 01:48:58,910
How could you even get into it? I don't
know. I don't know. And I tried. I think

1814
01:48:59,010 --> 01:49:02,840
if I can,
I realize that everybody has their,

1815
01:49:03,290 --> 01:49:06,260
maybe it's a nostalgia thing, maybe
it's because they liked it back then.

1816
01:49:07,160 --> 01:49:11,090
Maybe they don't smoke weed. That's
could be that they're all the classics.

1817
01:49:11,091 --> 01:49:13,540
Like I grew up with like Hulk Hogan and,

1818
01:49:13,560 --> 01:49:17,780
and all of them are like dead or retired.
So He's new guys. It's like I don't,

1819
01:49:17,990 --> 01:49:19,880
but I'm just saying like
the excitement I can,

1820
01:49:20,120 --> 01:49:24,980
I get the excitement for an 11 year old.
But like now when you have real sports,

1821
01:49:25,490 --> 01:49:26,920
and I love when the guys can,

1822
01:49:26,921 --> 01:49:29,750
they get real defensive like the guys
that are in it because they're always

1823
01:49:29,751 --> 01:49:32,070
doing their act no matter what
they're always doing. They're like,

1824
01:49:32,150 --> 01:49:34,670
you'll think the shit's real step
in the ring motherfucker. Okay.

1825
01:49:35,180 --> 01:49:35,630
Did you ever see,
see

1826
01:49:35,630 --> 01:49:39,470
John Stossel get beat up by the wrestler?
Yes, because he got, yeah. Yeah.

1827
01:49:39,530 --> 01:49:41,450
That's a classic.
This came up,

1828
01:49:41,480 --> 01:49:46,040
John Stossel gets beat up by wrestler key.
He got really fucked up.

1829
01:49:46,041 --> 01:49:48,250
He ruptured his here drum.
Yeah, and his hearing was,

1830
01:49:48,251 --> 01:49:52,690
and he had like long term
effects from that. Yeah. That
was a really not nice. No,

1831
01:49:52,691 --> 01:49:54,970
that he was getting a little
cocky with the guy. Sure.

1832
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:56,980
He could have asked him in
a more respectful way. Well,

1833
01:49:56,981 --> 01:50:00,100
I'm not going into the ring to tell these
guys that. I think this shit's lame.

1834
01:50:00,130 --> 01:50:04,870
Who is the guy who beat him up?
I asked Dave Schultz, right guy,

1835
01:50:04,871 --> 01:50:07,970
it looks crazy. Little
Silo. Good business.

1836
01:50:08,310 --> 01:50:10,050
It was a good bit and I wouldn't be in it.
That one.

1837
01:50:10,240 --> 01:50:13,090
Why is it a good book called the
only the Tufts that's written.

1838
01:50:13,091 --> 01:50:15,750
You ain't anything and there's palm cove
when the camera right. He ain't need it.

1839
01:50:16,060 --> 01:50:18,640
Rednecks rednecks out here. I ain't
in it because it's a tough business.

1840
01:50:20,110 --> 01:50:23,690
That's terrific. Is that all you got?
I asked you if a standard questions,

1841
01:50:24,520 --> 01:50:28,830
standard questions. I think as this
fake, you're going to get spiked. Ah,

1842
01:50:30,760 --> 01:50:34,010
what the Hell's wrong with you? That's
open hand slap. Do you think it's like,

1843
01:50:35,260 --> 01:50:36,093
whoa.

1844
01:50:40,710 --> 01:50:43,610
The second one. The second one is
I think the one that did the wrong.

1845
01:50:44,230 --> 01:50:47,290
In all fairness, he was a
little mouthy. Yeah, sure.

1846
01:50:47,380 --> 01:50:50,680
There's a little mouthy with the
wrestler, you know? Why would you, uh,

1847
01:50:50,681 --> 01:50:54,220
is this a good business? First
of all, it says an interviewer.

1848
01:50:54,790 --> 01:50:57,790
That's a sucky interview.
If I interviewed a guy like that,

1849
01:50:57,791 --> 01:51:00,790
I would expect them to be upset with
me too. It was just a good business.

1850
01:51:01,150 --> 01:51:03,250
Why would you ask if it's a good business?
A horrible question.

1851
01:51:03,940 --> 01:51:05,860
Tell me about wrestling.
How'd you get involved in this?

1852
01:51:06,040 --> 01:51:07,000
Like how long you've been doing it.

1853
01:51:07,030 --> 01:51:10,090
How do you respond to people that
say that this is not real? Not me.

1854
01:51:10,360 --> 01:51:13,300
I'm not saying that you gotta be
nice to the guy. Don't be a dick.

1855
01:51:13,480 --> 01:51:17,680
I think it's fake. Yeah. It was like,
what are you, why are you so cocky?

1856
01:51:17,920 --> 01:51:19,600
Like why do you think you
could say that to a man?

1857
01:51:19,601 --> 01:51:22,080
Like inches in front of them just
in salt. What he does, it's all,

1858
01:51:22,090 --> 01:51:26,060
it's stupid and it fucking dope. It's,

1859
01:51:26,440 --> 01:51:29,660
it's a ranged, but it's not.
They're hitting each other for real.

1860
01:51:29,680 --> 01:51:32,470
They're slamming each other for real.
That angle, that guy took us those two.

1861
01:51:32,530 --> 01:51:37,120
Cause I also, I mean it just in life,
you always size up who's in the room.

1862
01:51:37,260 --> 01:51:40,840
Right. And like I think some
enormous dudes are fucking idiots,

1863
01:51:41,020 --> 01:51:41,800
but I'm not going to be like,

1864
01:51:41,800 --> 01:51:45,400
I think you're a fucking idiot to your
face cause I don't want to get my ear

1865
01:51:45,460 --> 01:51:46,293
fucking smashed.

1866
01:51:46,870 --> 01:51:51,030
It was not necessary to create drama
there that didn't draw anything out.

1867
01:51:51,060 --> 01:51:53,500
He had a different idea of how that
was going to turn out. He thought,

1868
01:51:53,501 --> 01:51:56,380
I'm going to ask him these questions and
make them look stupid because I'm way

1869
01:51:56,381 --> 01:51:59,950
smarter than this fucking clown.
Exactly. And then he got it. Exactly.

1870
01:52:00,820 --> 01:52:04,240
And you know, I mean he lived, he learned,

1871
01:52:05,140 --> 01:52:07,060
he's got a mustache and he's a white guy.

1872
01:52:07,210 --> 01:52:11,440
His name is Stossel and he's got a giant
Burt Reynolds style must and he still

1873
01:52:11,441 --> 01:52:14,710
has it. Does he really? He's had that shit
for that. Yeah. He hasn't shaved that.

1874
01:52:15,430 --> 01:52:19,130
He's still rocks that that's a fucked up
thing to happen to have a guy like Matt

1875
01:52:19,150 --> 01:52:21,610
handy like that in front of a camera.
And no one gives a shit.

1876
01:52:21,640 --> 01:52:25,540
No one does anything. Oh yeah. Everybody
moves. Everyone backing away from them.

1877
01:52:25,541 --> 01:52:26,440
No one's going to save you.
Right.

1878
01:52:26,441 --> 01:52:29,230
Then what are you going to do
that guys should enormous. Yeah,

1879
01:52:29,350 --> 01:52:32,680
because he's a giant man.
You've got a real problem,

1880
01:52:35,520 --> 01:52:38,050
Mr Stossel.
You're not being protected.

1881
01:52:38,080 --> 01:52:42,010
A lot of those guys are absolute scary
fucking. Of course they are. Yeah,

1882
01:52:42,040 --> 01:52:46,040
they were fucking huge because like Brock
Brock Lesnar, that's an enormous human.

1883
01:52:46,070 --> 01:52:48,440
Yeah. It's like I want to beat the fuck
out of you in front of the camera, man.

1884
01:52:49,090 --> 01:52:52,640
I mean, he might get arrested
for it eventually, but
like while it's going down,

1885
01:52:52,641 --> 01:52:55,070
like no one's going to help you.
That's just a fact.

1886
01:52:55,071 --> 01:52:58,670
It's sure the rock is a
beast to, oh, he's enormous.

1887
01:52:58,770 --> 01:53:01,490
He was bigger than ever
now. Yeah, he's huge now.

1888
01:53:01,491 --> 01:53:02,780
He's like really into bodybuilding.

1889
01:53:02,781 --> 01:53:07,460
He puts a lot of videos and tweets a lot
about like all the workouts, workouts.

1890
01:53:07,490 --> 01:53:11,810
He's doing it like four o'clock in the
morning lands, 5:00 AM he's at the hotel.

1891
01:53:12,170 --> 01:53:12,960
I saw a thing.

1892
01:53:12,960 --> 01:53:17,210
He said he's doing like two hours of
cardio and then three hours of that animal

1893
01:53:17,260 --> 01:53:19,050
is an animal total. And then he, uh,

1894
01:53:19,190 --> 01:53:23,390
he has cheat days that he puts online they
received but eats a hundred doughnuts,

1895
01:53:24,340 --> 01:53:28,040
doughnuts, giant stacks of brownies, jugs,

1896
01:53:28,070 --> 01:53:32,780
look several gallons of milk. I've seen
a lot of the like super athletes, uh,

1897
01:53:33,020 --> 01:53:34,640
post sugar,
like,

1898
01:53:34,880 --> 01:53:39,140
like a lot of like guys that are
doing like the super, you know,

1899
01:53:39,230 --> 01:53:40,720
cross training crossfit guys.

1900
01:53:41,500 --> 01:53:44,780
But their cheat thing is always
incredible amounts of sugar.

1901
01:53:45,110 --> 01:53:47,630
I think it's probably
cause a caloric intake.

1902
01:53:47,631 --> 01:53:50,990
Like they probably have an extreme
desire for heaven, caloric intake,

1903
01:53:51,020 --> 01:53:54,890
glucose kind of again, yeah, if you're
doing like crossfit and shit like that.

1904
01:53:54,891 --> 01:53:58,610
Plus also when you, you go with
like really healthy diet on the,

1905
01:53:58,700 --> 01:54:00,140
on a regular for the most part,

1906
01:54:00,530 --> 01:54:04,250
it's so tempting to go off the rails and
you still, you still gluten free. Yeah.

1907
01:54:04,251 --> 01:54:07,080
Yeah. How's that going? It's great.
I have no problems with it. Yeah,

1908
01:54:07,600 --> 01:54:12,230
I heard Udi bread is really good bread
to eat to try. So my try that out.

1909
01:54:12,800 --> 01:54:15,950
And then there's, uh, there's apparently
there's a gluten free bakery that sends,

1910
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:20,870
one sends us, wants to send us some
stuff. Nice. That's in La, you know,

1911
01:54:21,080 --> 01:54:24,320
I don't miss it that much. I tried some
gluten free pasta and it tastes fine.

1912
01:54:24,980 --> 01:54:28,160
The big thing to me is I feel
way different after I eat.

1913
01:54:28,730 --> 01:54:31,040
When I would eat bread I'd be like,
ugh.

1914
01:54:31,220 --> 01:54:34,580
And I always assumed that that was just
how I felt after I ate because I always

1915
01:54:34,581 --> 01:54:38,990
ate bread.
I always had bread or pasta like always.

1916
01:54:39,020 --> 01:54:41,780
And then when it stopped
it was like, oh, like,

1917
01:54:42,110 --> 01:54:46,700
like I was being poisoned essentially,
you know, like hard holy, you know.

1918
01:54:46,790 --> 01:54:50,540
Is it hard to do gluten free when you
travel? Like is it harder to, it's harder,

1919
01:54:50,541 --> 01:54:53,000
but when I say poison,
obviously I'm being melodramatic.

1920
01:54:53,001 --> 01:54:55,910
But what I really mean is that your
body doesn't digest that shit. Well,

1921
01:54:55,911 --> 01:54:59,750
it takes a long time. It feels like
shit. It feels weird. And it's breads,

1922
01:54:59,751 --> 01:55:02,060
it's breads and pasta.
When you eliminate that stuff,

1923
01:55:02,061 --> 01:55:05,630
it eliminates a whole
level of after meal crash.

1924
01:55:05,870 --> 01:55:08,030
Like there's still a bit of an after meal,
slow down.

1925
01:55:08,031 --> 01:55:10,930
Like I want to have a big meal and then
go on stage for that very reason. Sure.

1926
01:55:11,430 --> 01:55:14,090
I wouldn't want to have a steak and
potatoes then run right on stage.

1927
01:55:14,540 --> 01:55:17,900
But the difference between a
steak and potatoes and steak,

1928
01:55:17,901 --> 01:55:22,520
potatoes and pasta is significant.
State potatoes and bread is significant.

1929
01:55:22,760 --> 01:55:27,440
That extra level of fucking
coma that you go into the pasta,

1930
01:55:27,470 --> 01:55:31,310
it's gone. That level's gone. I don't get
that level. And you still have potatoes?

1931
01:55:31,370 --> 01:55:34,040
Yeah,
you could have any carbs of rice.

1932
01:55:34,420 --> 01:55:36,930
It's the idea is all bait like it.

1933
01:55:36,931 --> 01:55:40,060
Some people say it's who we are and
it might be a little who we, you know,

1934
01:55:40,090 --> 01:55:42,680
it's psychosomatic. I'm
not, I don't think it is.

1935
01:55:42,681 --> 01:55:46,110
I think there's enough people that are
pointing to some research has been done

1936
01:55:46,111 --> 01:55:47,880
on it that it makes sense.

1937
01:55:48,030 --> 01:55:51,720
And there's also research done on
actual wheat itself that we'd itself

1938
01:55:51,721 --> 01:55:55,860
apparently in like the 1960s they altered
it and make it a little tougher so

1939
01:55:55,861 --> 01:55:59,550
they could survive pesticides and you
know, bug attacks and shit better.

1940
01:55:59,790 --> 01:56:00,990
And when they did that,

1941
01:56:00,991 --> 01:56:04,710
it made it much more difficult for people
to consume than the old school wheat

1942
01:56:04,740 --> 01:56:07,500
that people had been eating for
thousands of years. So essentially all,

1943
01:56:07,560 --> 01:56:10,740
I don't know shit about it. You're just
getting rid of wheat, right? Yup. Yeah.

1944
01:56:10,770 --> 01:56:15,660
That's it. Breads and even some alcohols
because it's a lot of alcohol years.

1945
01:56:15,661 --> 01:56:20,640
Yeah. But Not Heineken. Heineken,
which I drank anyway is uh,

1946
01:56:20,660 --> 01:56:21,510
is gluten free.

1947
01:56:21,690 --> 01:56:25,110
But like that's stuff that I love that
black Butte porter that's got tons of

1948
01:56:25,111 --> 01:56:27,210
gluten in it.
There's a lot of gluteny beers.

1949
01:56:27,570 --> 01:56:30,720
There's a lot of gluten in like things
like clam chowder has gluten in it.

1950
01:56:31,150 --> 01:56:34,900
It's a lot of stuff. Like you wouldn't
expect like powder you edge. I mean, you,

1951
01:56:34,940 --> 01:56:38,550
you're always reading about it now. Yeah.
I know what you can eat. Yeah. I just,

1952
01:56:38,580 --> 01:56:43,500
I just completely quit.
I just stepped back and said,

1953
01:56:43,501 --> 01:56:47,310
well, let's see if it's worth doing.
I'll do it. And if it's not worth doing,

1954
01:56:47,311 --> 01:56:50,140
if I don't feel any different at all,
I'll go right back. But you feel great.

1955
01:56:50,280 --> 01:56:53,200
But I feel a difference. There's
definitely a difference. Um,

1956
01:56:53,270 --> 01:56:56,350
there's a book called wheat belly
that I still haven't read, but, uh,

1957
01:56:56,490 --> 01:57:01,490
a lot of people point to that as being
a good source of information as to why,

1958
01:57:03,120 --> 01:57:07,590
uh, there was a, a, a change
in, uh, in wheat itself.

1959
01:57:08,010 --> 01:57:09,660
And what they're saying is that,
um,

1960
01:57:10,160 --> 01:57:14,400
whole grains in 2012 or not the whole
grains of 1950, the 19th century,

1961
01:57:14,670 --> 01:57:19,670
the Bible pre biblical times modern wheat
in particular is genetically distant

1962
01:57:19,860 --> 01:57:24,860
from its predecessors thanks to extreme
genetic changes inflicted on wheat and

1963
01:57:27,721 --> 01:57:32,721
the 1960s in the 1970s in the
name of increased yield per acre.

1964
01:57:34,440 --> 01:57:35,273
Oh,
okay.

1965
01:57:35,700 --> 01:57:40,700
So the healthy whole grains have been
repeatedly shown to reduce risk in

1966
01:57:41,231 --> 01:57:45,210
diabetes, heart disease and
colon cancer. It's true.

1967
01:57:45,211 --> 01:57:48,960
But if whole grains are compared
to process white wheat flour,

1968
01:57:49,590 --> 01:57:53,700
it's guilty of the kind of flawed logic
that dominates nutritional thinking,

1969
01:57:53,710 --> 01:57:56,220
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Um,

1970
01:57:56,670 --> 01:58:01,670
so apparently the grain that people used
to eat is a much better tasting wheat

1971
01:58:04,490 --> 01:58:08,280
or a much better for you wheat,
but it just doesn't, it doesn't,

1972
01:58:08,430 --> 01:58:12,600
we don't have it anymore.
Wow.

1973
01:58:14,700 --> 01:58:18,870
Hmm. So eat a lot of protein
though. Yeah, I eat, um,

1974
01:58:19,050 --> 01:58:24,050
I almost all protein like fish or chicken
or meat or a and a lot of vegetables

1975
01:58:25,980 --> 01:58:28,350
and I still eat potatoes
and I'll still eat rice.

1976
01:58:28,650 --> 01:58:32,880
But there's a difference in the way
I feel. I just think digestion wise,

1977
01:58:32,881 --> 01:58:36,450
I think there's an issue with resources.
I think when you,

1978
01:58:36,451 --> 01:58:37,290
when you're eating wheat,

1979
01:58:37,350 --> 01:58:40,950
one thing that's happening is many more
resources that aren't used for other

1980
01:58:40,960 --> 01:58:44,680
things or use digest. It give,
must come down to like what it is.

1981
01:58:44,681 --> 01:58:49,630
When you think about a plate of Pasta,
chew that shit up, mash it up, swallow it,

1982
01:58:49,631 --> 01:58:52,540
and then pack it all together.
It's glue, you got glue,

1983
01:58:52,570 --> 01:58:54,650
you've got a big Wad of glue,
you know,

1984
01:58:54,970 --> 01:58:59,500
whereas your stomach acids are sort of
designed to digest other things like the

1985
01:58:59,501 --> 01:59:03,550
vegetables and meats. And I
think it's a grind man. I think,

1986
01:59:03,760 --> 01:59:06,760
and this is obviously coming from someone
who's nothing nutritionally sound,

1987
01:59:06,850 --> 01:59:10,000
I don't know what I'm talking about,
but I think it would just make sense.

1988
01:59:10,510 --> 01:59:14,380
And then once I noticed it, I
just, uh, he's still doing dairy.

1989
01:59:15,100 --> 01:59:19,000
Um, I tried to cut way back, but I
still like it. I like chocolate milk,

1990
01:59:19,410 --> 01:59:24,330
like ice cream too, but I cut back. But
it's still delicious when you don't,

1991
01:59:24,331 --> 01:59:28,120
I don't eat cereal anymore because
the gluten free cereals are not that.

1992
01:59:28,121 --> 01:59:30,460
You know what I mean? You
know, I like raisin bran.

1993
01:59:31,030 --> 01:59:36,030
I haven't found it gluten free raisin
brand so I don't even might exist but I

1994
01:59:36,611 --> 01:59:39,580
haven't found one yet.
So I stopped with my cereal.

1995
01:59:39,581 --> 01:59:42,630
I eat cereal like sometimes
late at night. It's like my, uh,

1996
01:59:42,640 --> 01:59:45,970
my cheat meal in front of the TV.
I get a big fucking boat.

1997
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:48,670
Kellogg's raisin bran or yeah,
go off son.

1998
01:59:49,060 --> 01:59:52,660
I cut that shit out entirely so
I don't really have as much milk,

1999
01:59:52,750 --> 01:59:56,650
but there's a lot of um, like companies
now that is catered to the gluten free.

2000
01:59:56,651 --> 01:59:56,861
Right.

2001
01:59:56,861 --> 02:00:00,310
There's always new things coming out to
the milk and cookies or another one I

2002
02:00:00,360 --> 02:00:04,450
miss. Yeah. I used to get these
uncle Eddie Vegan, whatever
the fuck it is. Cookies.

2003
02:00:04,451 --> 02:00:08,050
Is that what it is? I'm glad he's, I
think he's Vegan cookies from whole foods.

2004
02:00:08,360 --> 02:00:11,350
They're so good. Peanut butter and
chocolate chip. It listened to me.

2005
02:00:11,351 --> 02:00:16,000
If you're still eating gluten, don't,
don't, you know, don't pass up on these.

2006
02:00:16,001 --> 02:00:18,280
Please go get them because they're
the most delicious thing ever.

2007
02:00:18,580 --> 02:00:20,700
These vegan chocolate chip cookies,

2008
02:00:20,701 --> 02:00:23,020
the oatmeal chocolate chip
with a cold glass of milk.

2009
02:00:23,470 --> 02:00:28,270
I would eat those until I felt sick.
Trader Joe's trader Joe's made a crazy,

2010
02:00:28,380 --> 02:00:32,290
I tried to choke up really good. They're
so good. I don't know why they're not.

2011
02:00:32,350 --> 02:00:35,260
They don't tell us bad cause
they're vegan and he's fine.

2012
02:00:35,290 --> 02:00:38,770
Is there a gluten free version?
Well I think Vegan just lacking the eggs.

2013
02:00:39,010 --> 02:00:41,770
I don't know what they bind it with,
but is there one that you can get?

2014
02:00:41,771 --> 02:00:46,120
I haven't seen one yet.
I've seen chocolate chip
cookies that are gluten free.

2015
02:00:46,180 --> 02:00:49,300
They were pretty good. Pretty good.
They can't fuck with those oatmeal,

2016
02:00:49,301 --> 02:00:52,120
chocolate chip cookies.
Those were incredible.

2017
02:00:52,180 --> 02:00:57,010
I would go pick them all over non Vegan
ones. Yeah. That's how good they are.

2018
02:00:57,070 --> 02:01:01,510
Yeah, I've had, I always thought that
for me, the Tj ones were amazing.

2019
02:01:01,690 --> 02:01:02,950
I would sit in front of the TV,

2020
02:01:02,951 --> 02:01:04,800
like say if I was watching
a really good movie and I,

2021
02:01:04,801 --> 02:01:06,800
we need a whole bag of
those fuck healings.

2022
02:01:06,820 --> 02:01:09,070
It was probably several thousand calories.

2023
02:01:11,050 --> 02:01:15,880
A giant glass of milk. I love. Um,

2024
02:01:16,280 --> 02:01:18,740
I, there's so many times
have just been decadent,

2025
02:01:18,760 --> 02:01:20,530
but when you hear about how many calories,

2026
02:01:20,890 --> 02:01:23,200
some people can consider like
a Michael Phelps type dude,

2027
02:01:23,230 --> 02:01:27,820
that's just so fucking awesome.
I want to watch him while he's training.

2028
02:01:28,180 --> 02:01:31,780
Watching. Yes. Yes, I
do. I went and saw, yeah.

2029
02:01:31,810 --> 02:01:36,810
I mean they said to me like, uh, you
know, workouts are so intense. Yeah.

2030
02:01:37,150 --> 02:01:40,280
Is like get going.
First thing of the day

2031
02:01:40,490 --> 02:01:44,780
might be a few bacon, egg
and cheese sandwiches. Yeah.

2032
02:01:44,960 --> 02:01:47,330
And then like everything goes
down. It's like, all right,

2033
02:01:47,331 --> 02:01:49,910
you're in the pool and it's just
training, training, training.

2034
02:01:49,911 --> 02:01:54,140
It's get out and you eat like a
bowl of pasta. Like, you know,

2035
02:01:54,141 --> 02:01:57,980
that's enough to fill five
people's stomachs, you know? Yeah.

2036
02:01:57,981 --> 02:02:02,550
I think he probably blows off so much
insane energy. Yeah. It's not even, yeah,

2037
02:02:02,551 --> 02:02:04,160
it's got to be kidding.
Wrap your head around that.

2038
02:02:04,220 --> 02:02:07,460
What kind of shits this
guy taken for real?

2039
02:02:07,640 --> 02:02:11,600
It was feed thunder is all the time.
Number six, it's gotta go somewhere.

2040
02:02:11,601 --> 02:02:16,430
It's gotta be number six is what's the
number six on the Bristol stool chart?

2041
02:02:16,520 --> 02:02:20,150
What is the stool chart? It's
how they rate, uh, your shit's.

2042
02:02:20,390 --> 02:02:24,380
So one through seven one and two
are like you're grinding them out.

2043
02:02:24,381 --> 02:02:27,110
Like they're pretty difficult.
Most of my shifts are not impressive,

2044
02:02:27,170 --> 02:02:31,310
but every now and then I will give birth
to Godzilla. Well, is it a nice slider?

2045
02:02:31,460 --> 02:02:35,810
Oh yeah, that's a four sliders or for,
even if it's giants, that's what you want.

2046
02:02:36,080 --> 02:02:40,040
Even if it's giant. And if
five, six, six is really sloppy,

2047
02:02:40,100 --> 02:02:44,630
lots of little pieces blew it out
your ass. Yeah. And that happens.

2048
02:02:44,650 --> 02:02:46,870
Seven is all liquid.

2049
02:02:46,910 --> 02:02:51,060
No. And that was, are these bad or good?
On a scale of one, three and fours,

2050
02:02:51,600 --> 02:02:54,090
that's what you want. Three and four.
Three and four is where it's at.

2051
02:02:54,110 --> 02:02:57,330
We have forest one, three and
four. I'll tell you what, man.

2052
02:02:57,360 --> 02:03:01,800
A really good shit that you've held
in for a while is incredibly pleasing.

2053
02:03:01,860 --> 02:03:02,693
Oh yeah.

2054
02:03:02,800 --> 02:03:05,780
You've been holding it in and all of
the in far I've got to get this all out.

2055
02:03:05,781 --> 02:03:07,800
I gotta get to get,
got to get into until I had file.

2056
02:03:07,810 --> 02:03:10,080
Even if you're in a public
bathroom, you sit down, you just uh,

2057
02:03:10,200 --> 02:03:11,820
ah.

2058
02:03:11,920 --> 02:03:14,500
And it's so good that it doesn't bother
you that you're taking a shit in a

2059
02:03:14,501 --> 02:03:17,860
public bathroom. You just unload
that dragon right out of your ass,

2060
02:03:18,460 --> 02:03:20,860
swims out and destroys.

2061
02:03:20,920 --> 02:03:23,590
There's really no feeling like
it really no feeling like it.

2062
02:03:24,030 --> 02:03:26,850
Those are fun though cause it's
like your butthole sneezing

2063
02:03:27,050 --> 02:03:28,400
the seven one with the blood.

2064
02:03:28,401 --> 02:03:32,680
It's the word that's one with a
blood is seven Evans, blood sevens,

2065
02:03:32,690 --> 02:03:34,560
just all liquid,
no solid

2066
02:03:34,580 --> 02:03:36,530
material. The thing is, do you ever have,

2067
02:03:36,531 --> 02:03:40,760
when you hold it in and you know it's
going to be a five or six like you ever

2068
02:03:40,761 --> 02:03:41,600
have like a,

2069
02:03:41,840 --> 02:03:46,160
for me it's like if you have too greasy
breakfast and it's the first thing that

2070
02:03:46,161 --> 02:03:48,680
enters your stomach and
you know when you get up,

2071
02:03:48,770 --> 02:03:50,870
like if you're at a restaurant
you're like, this is gonna,

2072
02:03:50,960 --> 02:03:54,590
this is gonna be unbelievable in the next,
whenever,

2073
02:03:54,591 --> 02:03:57,560
whenever I could find a place to sit down,
this is going to be a disaster.

2074
02:03:58,040 --> 02:04:02,630
And then you get, if you're in a hotel,
you get up to your room and it is like a,

2075
02:04:02,680 --> 02:04:05,660
like a religious experience.
Yeah.

2076
02:04:06,180 --> 02:04:11,180
I had a recently had a gluten free vegan
cheese pizza and just the vegan cheese

2077
02:04:12,221 --> 02:04:15,250
doesn't digest in your body. Your bias
is like, what do you want from me?

2078
02:04:15,251 --> 02:04:18,400
And then just like the next
day it was like asteroids,

2079
02:04:18,401 --> 02:04:22,360
fireballs and it rains weren't coming
out even though it wasn't even spicy

2080
02:04:22,361 --> 02:04:25,960
cheese. It was just because it was
vegan shoes stung a little bit. Yeah,

2081
02:04:26,460 --> 02:04:27,820
it'll be stingers.
Ooh,

2082
02:04:29,880 --> 02:04:32,980
we'll base thing. Or is it your beautiful
here? You need to go to a doctor.

2083
02:04:32,981 --> 02:04:36,010
You know that, right? I told you
this before, just for your mind,

2084
02:04:36,220 --> 02:04:37,053
not even for your bud.

2085
02:04:38,160 --> 02:04:42,150
Then I've actually talked to said they
just go to too many of you out there in

2086
02:04:42,151 --> 02:04:44,670
the world. It's nothing I could
do. They got a full [inaudible].

2087
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:49,020
Everything's perfect. Everything's
perfect. Speaking of crazy doctors,

2088
02:04:49,050 --> 02:04:53,190
a Nigerian guy, uh,
working on, it's a college,

2089
02:04:53,490 --> 02:04:57,530
this college paper on the leader,

2090
02:04:57,690 --> 02:05:02,690
he proved that gay marriage
is impossible with magnets.

2091
02:05:02,850 --> 02:05:07,280
This is the single dumbest
thing anybody has ever seen.

2092
02:05:07,980 --> 02:05:10,230
It's amazing. This isn't
a hoax. This isn't the,

2093
02:05:10,231 --> 02:05:14,190
I don't know if you go to
death and tax mag, um, I think,

2094
02:05:14,820 --> 02:05:19,140
I don't think that's a legit website,
but this is, no, I think this is real.

2095
02:05:19,170 --> 02:05:22,980
I think this is totally real because
every other story, she was real so dumb.

2096
02:05:23,550 --> 02:05:26,730
Okay. This, I can't
even say the guy's name.

2097
02:05:26,990 --> 02:05:30,850
She Bouley heme.
I'm a la Ha.

2098
02:05:31,050 --> 02:05:36,000
A postgraduate student at the University
of Lagos in Nigeria has finally

2099
02:05:36,001 --> 02:05:38,520
discovered a way to
increase in convertible.

2100
02:05:38,520 --> 02:05:42,810
He proved that gay marriage is wrong
using a variety of scientific techniques

2101
02:05:43,650 --> 02:05:46,740
like magnets. And this sounds
promising. This is what he said.

2102
02:05:46,850 --> 02:05:50,770
This is in quotes to start with. Physics
is one of the most fundamental level,

2103
02:05:50,790 --> 02:05:54,720
the sciences.
And I used to bar magnets in my research.

2104
02:05:55,050 --> 02:05:58,830
Hey Bob magnet is it horizontal magnet
that has the North Pole and the South

2105
02:05:58,830 --> 02:06:01,920
Pole. And when you being to buy magnets
and you bring the North Pole together,

2106
02:06:02,100 --> 02:06:06,300
you will find the two north poles
do not attract. They will repel.

2107
02:06:07,200 --> 02:06:08,033
So

2108
02:06:09,430 --> 02:06:13,050
you pushed him away from showing that
a man should not attract that mine

2109
02:06:15,300 --> 02:06:18,120
showing that a man should
not attract the men.

2110
02:06:18,240 --> 02:06:20,250
If he bring to south both together,

2111
02:06:20,251 --> 02:06:24,450
you will find that the two south poles
will not attract indicating that they

2112
02:06:24,451 --> 02:06:27,660
same sex, mad at shooting,
not hold. A female,

2113
02:06:27,661 --> 02:06:31,960
should not attract female as the south
pole of the magnet does not attract a

2114
02:06:31,961 --> 02:06:36,060
south pole of I back that
brilliant, brilliant, hilarious.

2115
02:06:36,260 --> 02:06:38,640
It's got actually wrote this stuff down.
Maybe he's trolling,

2116
02:06:38,641 --> 02:06:39,900
maybe he's gay as fuck.

2117
02:06:40,260 --> 02:06:45,260
He's slinging Dick like he's handing
out Churros at affair and he's just,

2118
02:06:46,500 --> 02:06:49,740
and he's just like, listen,
I know what to do here.

2119
02:06:49,800 --> 02:06:53,040
I just tell them that it's no game
adage I went with telling me you want

2120
02:06:53,050 --> 02:06:55,170
attracted to a Dick,
suck on my Dick.

2121
02:06:55,171 --> 02:06:58,140
I do not believe is sucking up on my Dick.

2122
02:06:58,141 --> 02:07:01,940
I can't even believe you put a 10
to like this. I have to change too.

2123
02:07:01,970 --> 02:07:06,120
Stuck up on my Dick. I will come in your
mouth, but only this one time he uh,

2124
02:07:06,180 --> 02:07:09,390
he should hold a press conference. This
guy just so people can be like, ah,

2125
02:07:09,391 --> 02:07:13,710
I'm attracted to, I'm smelly armpits.
Which magnet can you show me?

2126
02:07:14,100 --> 02:07:17,160
We'll just prove my hard on.
Yeah.

2127
02:07:17,161 --> 02:07:20,490
Isn't that a thing with like a lot
of gay dudes there until like stinky.

2128
02:07:23,010 --> 02:07:28,010
I got something for you. Gay
dudes. Borys Tommy Button's red.

2129
02:07:31,210 --> 02:07:31,740
Yeah.

2130
02:07:31,740 --> 02:07:36,520
Did you ever get attacked or picked on
or rather a hit on by getting hit on

2131
02:07:36,521 --> 02:07:40,330
gays? Sure. What did they do to you?
What's the number one move do you think?

2132
02:07:40,331 --> 02:07:43,960
First of all, we offended. Do you like
it? I don't look that gay. No, no.

2133
02:07:43,961 --> 02:07:47,740
I wasn't offended. I mean, um, I've been,

2134
02:07:47,800 --> 02:07:51,610
I've been so hit on that I'm like,
I really feel bad for women.

2135
02:07:51,640 --> 02:07:54,550
Like it puts it in perspective,
you know? Oh, right, right. Yeah.

2136
02:07:54,551 --> 02:07:57,250
Like she has a real pig man. Like
I'm not a piece of meat. Jesus.

2137
02:07:57,330 --> 02:08:00,670
I had a comic corner me once and
get really goofy with me. Yeah.

2138
02:08:00,710 --> 02:08:05,380
I had Montreal drunk
and it was so vile icon.

2139
02:08:05,490 --> 02:08:09,370
A totally understood like what it must
be like for a woman to get hit up by some

2140
02:08:09,371 --> 02:08:13,930
sleazy dude's sleazy guy. Had A sleazy
guy do it too. And he was like, uh, what?

2141
02:08:13,970 --> 02:08:15,130
What did he say? He goes, he was,

2142
02:08:15,190 --> 02:08:18,610
he was a comic and he's bringing
me on stage and he had been like,

2143
02:08:18,790 --> 02:08:21,340
that's a good shirt on you and all that,
you know, all those little comment.

2144
02:08:21,341 --> 02:08:23,800
I was like, all right man. And then
he was like, when I bring you up,

2145
02:08:23,801 --> 02:08:27,430
and I could tell he was hammered. What
if I kiss you on the mouth? I'll be like,

2146
02:08:27,460 --> 02:08:31,220
don't do that dude. He was like, all
right. All right. I want to like,

2147
02:08:31,450 --> 02:08:35,070
oh my gosh, don't do
that. A comic on stage.

2148
02:08:35,320 --> 02:08:37,070
He lick the mic off
before it gave it to you.

2149
02:08:37,100 --> 02:08:41,580
I'm hoping that some of his
saliva we'll get in yours.

2150
02:08:42,080 --> 02:08:46,720
No, he was just like, he was a
creep. Right. So I was like, that's,

2151
02:08:46,810 --> 02:08:50,760
that's what a creepy dude is. To want
to name names. No, don't do it. Okay.

2152
02:08:53,290 --> 02:08:56,380
What if it's the same guy? It could be.
What's the same? The name of the guy?

2153
02:08:56,950 --> 02:09:00,000
I can't, don't do it. I don't want it. No.

2154
02:09:00,870 --> 02:09:02,130
Brad's got the camera on now.

2155
02:09:08,610 --> 02:09:10,600
Oh No, no, no, no.

2156
02:09:14,190 --> 02:09:15,750
People like his forensic with that

2157
02:09:20,700 --> 02:09:22,320
I made up.
Don't worry about it folks.

2158
02:09:25,220 --> 02:09:26,580
You want to hear that
something better than that.

2159
02:09:27,960 --> 02:09:31,440
I was in a restaurant the other
day. This is not even gay. Oh, okay.

2160
02:09:31,530 --> 02:09:36,300
This is just disgusting. Okay. A woman,
uh, nothing to do with Gavin. He and say,

2161
02:09:36,301 --> 02:09:40,840
why is scarier than that woman
brought in a dog, a giant dog,

2162
02:09:40,860 --> 02:09:42,570
like a lab.
Right.

2163
02:09:42,600 --> 02:09:46,530
And she sat down at a restaurant and the
of the labs sat down next to our table

2164
02:09:46,920 --> 02:09:49,650
and I go, what the fuck's going
on? And the waitress told her,

2165
02:09:49,830 --> 02:09:54,060
told me that she has an
emotional needs dog. Oh yeah.

2166
02:09:54,780 --> 02:09:59,550
Yeah. Did you know about this?
Absolutely. Tom. Tom got it. Yeah.

2167
02:09:59,700 --> 02:10:02,120
You got an emotional needs
talk and I might get it to

2168
02:10:04,200 --> 02:10:07,170
take it on the airplane for free. Get
the fuck out of here. Wait a minute.

2169
02:10:07,410 --> 02:10:09,900
So if you have an emotional needs dog,

2170
02:10:09,901 --> 02:10:12,210
like say if you get your dog and
emotional needs talking license,

2171
02:10:12,211 --> 02:10:17,100
you could take that dog on an airplane for
free. For free. For free. Yes, for free.

2172
02:10:18,040 --> 02:10:21,120
But for a small,
every airline has like a different policy.

2173
02:10:21,150 --> 02:10:25,590
I mean like what if someone's a massively
allergic to dogs are sitting in front

2174
02:10:25,591 --> 02:10:27,780
of you.
I have a new dog as dirty clown,

2175
02:10:27,781 --> 02:10:32,550
like fucking dogs get on planes
where I was like, this is a joke,

2176
02:10:32,551 --> 02:10:37,250
right? Like a Basset Hound and and
so the phone, we were all like,

2177
02:10:37,251 --> 02:10:40,100
what's going on? Like the same thing.
We were on a plane and they were like,

2178
02:10:40,520 --> 02:10:44,830
it's their fucking emotional needs
dog and emotional needs done.

2179
02:10:45,050 --> 02:10:49,580
And I've seen, I've seen a, uh,
what's it called? An English bulldog,

2180
02:10:50,330 --> 02:10:54,620
you know, like a big bulldog.
Uh, get on. Same thing.

2181
02:10:54,640 --> 02:10:56,930
Like it's emotional
needs dog is incredible.

2182
02:10:57,230 --> 02:10:59,840
I couldn't imagine that it would
be legal in a restaurant though.

2183
02:10:59,841 --> 02:11:03,770
That is so crazy because actually one
that has an outside patio and she wasn't

2184
02:11:03,771 --> 02:11:08,630
even using the outside patio really?
This dog. Right? Pretty Open asshole.

2185
02:11:08,690 --> 02:11:13,040
It's just sitting there in the middle
of the dining room. Yeah. Yeah.

2186
02:11:13,160 --> 02:11:16,160
Not Washed. No. I mean
the dog takes shits.

2187
02:11:16,360 --> 02:11:19,640
Tony's hosing his ass off before they
bring them out in public and make it

2188
02:11:19,641 --> 02:11:23,930
presentable. He's just farting right
in front of everybody of Said lab man.

2189
02:11:23,931 --> 02:11:28,340
It was a lap dog. Golden
Lab. Yeah. Crazy bitch. Yeah.

2190
02:11:28,341 --> 02:11:33,110
And uh, I think, did you tweet this?
Yeah, yeah. Yeah. It was a notable person.

2191
02:11:33,710 --> 02:11:37,640
Famous person. A famous woman. That's
funny. Ridiculous broken bitch.

2192
02:11:38,780 --> 02:11:40,100
I can't bring a fucking dark.

2193
02:11:40,101 --> 02:11:43,790
That is so it's so rude to bring a big
dog into a restaurant like that and act

2194
02:11:43,791 --> 02:11:48,440
like you're king shit and just sit there
with the dog and pat it like that idea

2195
02:11:48,441 --> 02:11:53,330
of emotional needs dog. It's
so crazy. It's so crazy.

2196
02:11:53,840 --> 02:11:55,190
The problem is,
look,

2197
02:11:55,191 --> 02:11:58,520
there are people that are absolutely
devastated and there are probably people

2198
02:11:58,521 --> 02:12:01,170
that if it wasn't for the dog, they
probably wouldn't even want to be alive.

2199
02:12:01,190 --> 02:12:04,900
There are is a fact that that that thing
really applies to where it's very, yeah.

2200
02:12:05,120 --> 02:12:07,390
Guess what? You don't get it to bring
your dog in a fucking restaurant.

2201
02:12:07,870 --> 02:12:09,230
Doesn't matter.
Don't get it.

2202
02:12:09,231 --> 02:12:14,231
Bring that big stupid hairy animal into
a restaurant and then someone touches

2203
02:12:14,871 --> 02:12:18,830
something that your dog's butt touched
and they get worms because I easily could

2204
02:12:18,831 --> 02:12:20,540
happen.
You don't know if your dog has worms.

2205
02:12:20,840 --> 02:12:22,280
You don't know what the
fuck's going on there.

2206
02:12:22,310 --> 02:12:25,400
You barely take care of that thing.
How many checkups you give her a dog.

2207
02:12:25,430 --> 02:12:28,790
God can't even talk.
It's accounts that paranoid though.

2208
02:12:28,791 --> 02:12:31,880
You're going to be more as paranoid. Just
opening the door to go to the bathroom.

2209
02:12:31,970 --> 02:12:33,950
Not about paranoid due
to have dogs in my own.

2210
02:12:34,070 --> 02:12:37,340
You just don't bring your dogs near a
fucking dinner table. It's that simple.

2211
02:12:37,400 --> 02:12:39,190
When you're,
you're out there at a restaurant.

2212
02:12:39,200 --> 02:12:42,350
The dog is literally at the tail
putting his face on the table.

2213
02:12:42,530 --> 02:12:44,630
The person's eating and
the dogs right here.

2214
02:12:44,840 --> 02:12:46,970
She's touching it and then
she's touching the table.

2215
02:12:47,030 --> 02:12:49,550
She's rubbing the dog's hand
and she's picking up the forks.

2216
02:12:49,730 --> 02:12:53,180
She's mean she's a dirty bitch
and that if she wants to do that,

2217
02:12:53,181 --> 02:12:54,320
I don't do that at home.

2218
02:12:54,321 --> 02:12:57,930
I don't allow my dogs to fucking sit right
near that off my ice cream cone. Well,

2219
02:12:57,950 --> 02:13:02,730
you're an idiot. That's a dumb thing.
You probably have toxoplasma. Oh,

2220
02:13:02,870 --> 02:13:05,270
but you, you know, if people
want to do that at home,

2221
02:13:05,271 --> 02:13:07,520
they choose to do that at home.
That's one thing.

2222
02:13:07,521 --> 02:13:11,710
But if you have that dog around where
other people eat inside a building, it's,

2223
02:13:11,870 --> 02:13:15,110
there's a reason why everybody can't do
it. Yeah. She just wants her dog with her.

2224
02:13:15,170 --> 02:13:17,370
Yeah. Well, there's a reason why
everybody can't do it because this,

2225
02:13:17,371 --> 02:13:21,170
that if it was totally sanitary,
anybody would be allowed to do it.

2226
02:13:21,171 --> 02:13:22,160
We wouldn't even care.

2227
02:13:22,490 --> 02:13:26,510
The reason why it's not allowed it's
cause it's unsanitary. Right. So to,

2228
02:13:26,530 --> 02:13:31,490
to put other people's
health concerns, oh, uh,

2229
02:13:31,530 --> 02:13:36,530
behind your need to be with a fucking
thing that loves you all the time is

2230
02:13:36,541 --> 02:13:38,080
incredibly selfish.
Yeah.

2231
02:13:38,220 --> 02:13:42,450
To bring that into a restaurant and
know that you are violating the standard

2232
02:13:42,451 --> 02:13:45,870
health procedures with a loophole and
those health procedures were put in place

2233
02:13:45,871 --> 02:13:49,500
to make sure that people don't get sick
from other people's dirty ass, stinky.

2234
02:13:49,501 --> 02:13:52,230
Dot. What about, what about when
it's a service dog? What do you know?

2235
02:13:52,231 --> 02:13:57,090
The person needs it, but it's still
a dirty, it's a, it has a problem.

2236
02:13:57,160 --> 02:14:01,620
It makes more sense at least. But it's
still that dog still there. It's still is.

2237
02:14:01,760 --> 02:14:02,130
Well,
the,

2238
02:14:02,130 --> 02:14:04,490
I think they should take precautions
and the people that work there should

2239
02:14:04,491 --> 02:14:07,560
probably clean up extra good anywhere
around the animal. But if I get,

2240
02:14:07,561 --> 02:14:12,030
you're a blind person. Yeah, I hear Ya.
It makes sense. But this is not, not that,

2241
02:14:12,060 --> 02:14:16,590
this is just the needy, crazy California.
It's California. That's California Ed.

2242
02:14:16,591 --> 02:14:18,960
Crazy famous people.
California is the first.

2243
02:14:19,030 --> 02:14:20,780
I remember when I moved
here and I started,

2244
02:14:20,781 --> 02:14:25,290
I was getting like postproduction jobs
working in different places, right.

2245
02:14:25,410 --> 02:14:28,850
And Stat people on staff from the,
uh,

2246
02:14:29,070 --> 02:14:33,570
post production supervisor or to
a producer, a writer to editors.

2247
02:14:33,810 --> 02:14:38,190
There were fucking like 11
dogs, right? The first one,
I was like, what is going on?

2248
02:14:38,760 --> 02:14:41,310
And it was like, well, you know, we
bring our dogs to work. And I was like,

2249
02:14:41,610 --> 02:14:43,940
I've never seen this
anywhere where people just,

2250
02:14:43,950 --> 02:14:48,570
and then every place I got a Gig
after that always had 10 fucking dogs.

2251
02:14:48,930 --> 02:14:51,420
And they were like, well, yeah, I mean
people just bring their dogs to work.

2252
02:14:51,660 --> 02:14:55,260
I used to bring my dog to news
radio. Yeah. Frank Sinatra.

2253
02:14:55,261 --> 02:14:56,790
The pit bull is to bring him to work.

2254
02:14:56,910 --> 02:15:00,060
And I used to bring squeaky squeaky
Fromme my other pit voice to bring her to

2255
02:15:00,061 --> 02:15:03,480
fear fat. It's a caliph. It's California.
Yeah. Squeaky. Fromme it was creepy.

2256
02:15:03,481 --> 02:15:05,970
A little bitch. I couldn't leave her
at home with the other dogs. Oh really?

2257
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:09,330
She would start some shit. What's, what
kind of dog was it as a pit bull? Hippo.

2258
02:15:09,370 --> 02:15:13,170
So I'd bring her with me to work. Good dog
though. Oh she was sweetie with people.

2259
02:15:13,260 --> 02:15:15,540
Yeah. She was a real sweetie
with people. She loved people.

2260
02:15:15,720 --> 02:15:18,900
She hated other dogs though she didn't
like them because they would take

2261
02:15:18,901 --> 02:15:19,800
attention away from her.

2262
02:15:19,801 --> 02:15:24,090
She was a rescue dog and there's a great
thing about rescuing dogs and that you

2263
02:15:24,091 --> 02:15:27,300
get to save a dog from, you
know, most likely being put down.

2264
02:15:27,420 --> 02:15:30,270
But the bad thing about rescue
dogs is like when I got her,

2265
02:15:30,271 --> 02:15:35,010
she was almost a year, she had been
really badly abused and so that,

2266
02:15:35,011 --> 02:15:38,790
that almost a year of her life
she had been treated like shit.

2267
02:15:39,060 --> 02:15:41,430
And when I came along and
treated her with love,

2268
02:15:41,640 --> 02:15:45,450
anybody that got between that
was like very dangerous to her.

2269
02:15:45,480 --> 02:15:48,330
Like another dog that came
in and tried to get the love,

2270
02:15:48,540 --> 02:15:51,690
like she would snap at the cat, like she
put it, get the fuck away from my man.

2271
02:15:52,070 --> 02:15:56,010
Like she wanted only me to pet her and
when she would come running with the

2272
02:15:56,011 --> 02:15:56,844
other dogs,

2273
02:15:57,150 --> 02:16:00,000
she would growl at them and snap at them
to get out of the way so that she could

2274
02:16:00,001 --> 02:16:04,590
get pat back. Everybody else off.
Yeah. Yeah. She was just gangster.

2275
02:16:04,950 --> 02:16:08,400
And were you able to never let it
all out? No, she killed my dog.

2276
02:16:08,740 --> 02:16:13,050
She killed one of my dog, just she really,
she actually killed two of them. Yeah,

2277
02:16:13,080 --> 02:16:15,840
she killed one of the dogs and then she
got in a fight with a male and to the

2278
02:16:15,841 --> 02:16:20,300
point where he had to be put down.
Oh my God. Yeah. She was crazy there.

2279
02:16:20,350 --> 02:16:23,820
They're crazy dogs. The problem with
pit bulls is you're dealing with,

2280
02:16:24,100 --> 02:16:26,880
and people who get mad at
me for saying this, listen,

2281
02:16:26,881 --> 02:16:28,380
nobody loves those dogs more than I do.

2282
02:16:28,410 --> 02:16:31,720
I've had a few them in my life
and frank was an amazing dog.

2283
02:16:32,210 --> 02:16:36,010
He was a beautiful, smart,
a sweetheart with people,

2284
02:16:36,011 --> 02:16:39,520
with all my friends who was so kind.
He was since you like sweet, friendly,

2285
02:16:39,521 --> 02:16:44,170
loving dog, but he was a Hawaiian boar
fighting dog. Like they will use him,

2286
02:16:44,260 --> 02:16:49,260
use him to hunt bores and those dogs were
so animal aggressive because they were

2287
02:16:49,301 --> 02:16:52,090
bred to go after bores and hold onto them.

2288
02:16:52,380 --> 02:16:54,370
There was so smart because of that.

2289
02:16:54,480 --> 02:16:57,160
They were like really clever and
they'd have really high prey drive.

2290
02:16:57,310 --> 02:17:00,490
And a lot of times in
dogs high prey drive, uh,

2291
02:17:00,610 --> 02:17:04,420
is also with high intelligence.
Like a lot of those dogs that get through,

2292
02:17:04,570 --> 02:17:08,680
especially because the cruel nature
of both dogfighting and using them for

2293
02:17:08,681 --> 02:17:10,420
animals,
for hunting and stuff like that.

2294
02:17:10,630 --> 02:17:13,840
Like you have to have like only
the best, wildest, craziest,

2295
02:17:13,841 --> 02:17:18,220
strongest bravest dog to breed. And that's
how you make like a strong bloodline.

2296
02:17:18,610 --> 02:17:21,450
So the real problem is like they're,

2297
02:17:21,490 --> 02:17:23,860
they're bred to do shit
you don't want them to do,

2298
02:17:24,010 --> 02:17:28,050
they're bred to fight their
bread, dig, want to kill
animals. Right? So it's, it's,

2299
02:17:28,180 --> 02:17:29,740
even if you're really
good at training them,

2300
02:17:29,770 --> 02:17:33,070
which I was really good at training dogs.
I've been training dogs my whole life.

2301
02:17:33,071 --> 02:17:36,850
I'm pretty good at it. I mean, I'm not a
professional, I'm not like a, you know,

2302
02:17:37,180 --> 02:17:38,970
guys who trained dogs for Schudson,

2303
02:17:39,010 --> 02:17:42,880
but I'm pretty good at getting a dog to
explain what I want and I know not to be

2304
02:17:42,881 --> 02:17:46,170
cruel to them and always give them love.
And when you get a new puppy,

2305
02:17:46,190 --> 02:17:49,990
spend more time with the big dog than
you do with the puppy to let the big dog

2306
02:17:49,991 --> 02:17:52,600
know that the little dogs around,
you're going to get more attention,

2307
02:17:52,601 --> 02:17:56,860
you're going to get more attention. Like
I'm good at that shit, but they, you know,

2308
02:17:56,890 --> 02:17:57,820
they have a nature,

2309
02:17:57,940 --> 02:18:01,660
they have a nature from thousands of
years at breeding and it's really hard to,

2310
02:18:01,720 --> 02:18:04,390
to change. It's really hard.
It's just the wiring, right?

2311
02:18:04,391 --> 02:18:05,560
Like it's just not going to a bit,

2312
02:18:05,650 --> 02:18:09,400
I mean certainly you can develop dogs
that are more aggressive because you're

2313
02:18:09,410 --> 02:18:12,160
promoted,
but I did the opposite of promoting it.

2314
02:18:12,161 --> 02:18:14,080
I tried to discourage
it whenever possible.

2315
02:18:14,081 --> 02:18:17,800
I'm trying to encourage love whenever
possible and like make them be sweeties

2316
02:18:18,060 --> 02:18:19,480
get getting plenty of exercise.

2317
02:18:19,481 --> 02:18:22,180
I bought a big yard just because I have
plenty of room for them to run around.

2318
02:18:22,180 --> 02:18:25,540
And want them to be contained.
It doesn't matter.

2319
02:18:25,541 --> 02:18:27,940
They want to fuck up other dogs
and she's still one of the kills.

2320
02:18:27,941 --> 02:18:32,650
They wanted to go to war, so fight to
the death, you know? Yeah. It's crazy.

2321
02:18:32,800 --> 02:18:36,460
But there's meanwhile she's slept
in my bed. Sweetest dog ever. Damn.

2322
02:18:36,461 --> 02:18:37,660
She's my baby.
You know,

2323
02:18:37,661 --> 02:18:40,780
she would go on trips with me and she
would sit right right beside me and my car

2324
02:18:40,781 --> 02:18:43,630
seat. Like if I drove somewhere, I
would take her with me all the time.

2325
02:18:43,631 --> 02:18:45,880
It took her to work all the time.
She would sit right next to me,

2326
02:18:45,890 --> 02:18:50,830
just big stupid face, head out the window.
And that's awesome. Dogs are amazing.

2327
02:18:50,831 --> 02:18:54,310
I love dogs, but you can't bring me
the restaurant. You fucking crazy.

2328
02:18:54,311 --> 02:18:58,450
Can't have that dog dirty ass hole out
there with my little kids are touch and

2329
02:18:58,451 --> 02:19:01,570
shit.
One side of the restaurant is a dog.

2330
02:19:01,600 --> 02:19:04,840
They'll sides of three year old with a
vulnerable immune system and your dirty

2331
02:19:04,841 --> 02:19:06,670
stinky ass hall.
Do you bring

2332
02:19:06,950 --> 02:19:11,090
dog out me? Yeah. No I don't.
I take my dog to restaurants,

2333
02:19:11,091 --> 02:19:13,370
but I'm more concerned about
just fucking restaurants.

2334
02:19:13,371 --> 02:19:17,600
These waiters and with their dirty
poop hands. Fucking tough. I mean,

2335
02:19:17,601 --> 02:19:21,470
I worked in restaurants, so I saw shit
like, like, oh, that guy pissed me off.

2336
02:19:21,471 --> 02:19:24,360
I might take his hamburger patty, put it
against my balls and put it back on it.

2337
02:19:24,800 --> 02:19:29,480
I saw that shit all the time. Oh fuck.
I've done it a few times. I've seen,

2338
02:19:29,630 --> 02:19:31,460
how dare you,
you should lie about that.

2339
02:19:31,940 --> 02:19:36,050
It's been seven years is that statue
of limitation is legally people put on

2340
02:19:36,051 --> 02:19:39,020
their balls. Oh Dude, I
there. That's horrible.

2341
02:19:39,170 --> 02:19:44,000
I did this one where this guy kept on
and he said he wanted a medium rare steak

2342
02:19:44,330 --> 02:19:47,450
and so I gave him a medium, right? It
was perfect. He goes, that's too raw.

2343
02:19:47,451 --> 02:19:49,100
And I'm like,
do you even know what a medium rare steak?

2344
02:19:49,101 --> 02:19:51,620
And so we brought it back medium
and then he came. It's like, oh,

2345
02:19:51,621 --> 02:19:53,990
you overcooked it. I was like, all
right, you didn't know anything.

2346
02:19:54,110 --> 02:19:56,480
So like when they gave us the stake back,

2347
02:19:56,481 --> 02:19:59,000
I just wiped it all over my ass hole
and then put it back on the plate.

2348
02:19:59,250 --> 02:20:01,240
And then you fed it all? Oh yeah. Wow.

2349
02:20:01,450 --> 02:20:06,300
Brian route all of your asshole.
What'd your asshole feel like?

2350
02:20:06,590 --> 02:20:09,480
I think he lost there. The
guy didn't even know. I mean,

2351
02:20:09,481 --> 02:20:13,370
well you had state juice all over your
ass hot steak on your ass. Yes I did.

2352
02:20:13,680 --> 02:20:14,550
You're a problem.

2353
02:20:14,580 --> 02:20:18,970
Didn't someone that seasoning kind of
give it a little kick and it tastes like

2354
02:20:19,480 --> 02:20:23,070
suck. They know you can't even
taste them with your asshole. Yeah,

2355
02:20:23,071 --> 02:20:24,120
but you know we're on that thing.

2356
02:20:24,520 --> 02:20:27,910
Definitely a thing where when
you're a waiter and and the the,

2357
02:20:28,030 --> 02:20:31,810
the table is treating you like shit.
It's like, you know, fuck you dude.

2358
02:20:31,811 --> 02:20:34,450
I don't give a fuck at that. The, you
know, I'm working at this restaurant,

2359
02:20:34,451 --> 02:20:37,450
how you're talking to me right now.
And so you'll see there's,

2360
02:20:37,570 --> 02:20:40,180
that happens more than ever. That's why
like when you can play it at restaurants,

2361
02:20:40,181 --> 02:20:41,260
unless you're cool about it,

2362
02:20:41,410 --> 02:20:44,710
you got to watch the fuck out because
it's a lot of people do crazy shit.

2363
02:20:44,790 --> 02:20:47,910
Yeah, no doubt. No doubt.
I think that restaurants,

2364
02:20:47,970 --> 02:20:51,150
like when I go and I tried to
be like super nice to everybody,

2365
02:20:51,151 --> 02:20:53,760
I'm super cognizant of that. You don't
want to treat somebody like shit.

2366
02:20:53,761 --> 02:20:58,230
It's about to handle your food. You
gotta be careful about that, man. Yeah.

2367
02:20:58,530 --> 02:20:59,970
I've seen people do things.

2368
02:20:59,971 --> 02:21:04,590
I worked at a restaurant and I saw a dude
spit and someone's a ice cream shake.

2369
02:21:04,880 --> 02:21:08,970
It took a big Haka Louie
and stuck it in that Oh man,

2370
02:21:09,010 --> 02:21:12,120
and for no reason, he just decided
to be cute. He thought it was cute.

2371
02:21:12,121 --> 02:21:13,350
He would be tried to be funny.

2372
02:21:13,650 --> 02:21:16,950
I was working as a dishwasher and he was
working as a cook and he would go and

2373
02:21:16,951 --> 02:21:20,220
spit on the cheeseburgers and shit
and flip up. That's fucked up, man.

2374
02:21:20,490 --> 02:21:24,090
He was going to watch this.
Jesus Christ,

2375
02:21:24,380 --> 02:21:25,191
the restaurant I worked at,

2376
02:21:25,191 --> 02:21:30,191
and there was a bandaid that was in
the tomato basil soup and one of the

2377
02:21:30,431 --> 02:21:30,980
waiters,

2378
02:21:30,980 --> 02:21:34,760
waitresses brought it back and it's like
somebody put a bandaid in the soup and

2379
02:21:34,761 --> 02:21:37,160
I just remember they
never replaced the soup.

2380
02:21:37,220 --> 02:21:39,680
They just got her more
soup from the same thing

2381
02:21:40,100 --> 02:21:40,933
it was in.

2382
02:21:40,940 --> 02:21:45,940
I was in this one place in Hawaii and
these people were trying to scam the

2383
02:21:46,071 --> 02:21:49,970
waiter. They were trying to scam the
waiter by saying that the waiter has to do

2384
02:21:49,971 --> 02:21:53,800
something about, you know, their bill
because the rice was too hot for like,

2385
02:21:53,810 --> 02:21:56,330
first he brought the rice over,
it was cold,

2386
02:21:56,510 --> 02:21:59,360
then you bring it over and
it's so hot it burns her mouth.

2387
02:21:59,361 --> 02:22:02,710
I mean you guys got to get it together
here and like they were being like,

2388
02:22:02,900 --> 02:22:05,920
it was an English guy.
He was being loud and belligerent.

2389
02:22:06,130 --> 02:22:09,440
It was so bad and so blatant and it
was almost like he was doing like some

2390
02:22:09,441 --> 02:22:13,220
undercover camera, like showing
how someone could scam a waiter.

2391
02:22:13,580 --> 02:22:17,900
And so then the guy brings
over the, uh, the uh,

2392
02:22:17,930 --> 02:22:21,680
the manager of the restaurant, you know,
he insists on speaking to the manager.

2393
02:22:21,830 --> 02:22:24,830
Like he feels like,
like by the time the manager gets there,

2394
02:22:24,831 --> 02:22:27,240
the manager just wants to calm everything
down. Can we comp your meal sir?

2395
02:22:27,660 --> 02:22:31,260
And they're working on trying to get the
meal comps so you can tell the manager

2396
02:22:31,261 --> 02:22:34,500
knows this guy's full of shit. Of
course. So he like lets the guy talk out.

2397
02:22:34,501 --> 02:22:35,334
But the guy was,

2398
02:22:35,520 --> 02:22:39,540
he didn't even try to calm
him down whether God was
talking like really loud in

2399
02:22:39,541 --> 02:22:40,374
this restaurant.

2400
02:22:40,440 --> 02:22:43,320
So it became a really strange thing
where like everybody was like paying

2401
02:22:43,321 --> 02:22:46,960
attention to it. It was theater, but
the manager just stayed calm like, sir,

2402
02:22:47,070 --> 02:22:49,920
what are you trying to do? Like, what
would you like? And the guy's like, well,

2403
02:22:49,921 --> 02:22:52,410
I'm saying you guys have got to
make amends here. This, this,

2404
02:22:52,440 --> 02:22:55,740
this rice was cold and now it's so
hot. She burned her mouth. Like,

2405
02:22:55,890 --> 02:22:58,950
I almost burned my mouth. And
he's like, and you know you,

2406
02:22:58,951 --> 02:23:02,760
you didn't have one of the specials on
the menu. I go to order it. You're out.

2407
02:23:02,940 --> 02:23:06,030
My good man, you know, I'm from London.
If this happens in London, you know,

2408
02:23:06,031 --> 02:23:08,260
they do something about it. And
the guy said, what are you just,

2409
02:23:08,270 --> 02:23:11,850
what are you suggesting sir? He goes,
well, I'm suggesting that you, you know,

2410
02:23:11,851 --> 02:23:15,210
take care of our bill or some something
along those lines. And the guy's like,

2411
02:23:15,211 --> 02:23:16,330
this is not going to happen.
Sorry.

2412
02:23:17,470 --> 02:23:21,840
And another waiter comes over and then
they're just hovering over this guy while

2413
02:23:21,841 --> 02:23:26,310
he pretends to like be outraged about
this. He's trying to put together a scam.

2414
02:23:26,311 --> 02:23:30,370
He just doesn't have any ammunition,
but they're going for it and see

2415
02:23:30,790 --> 02:23:35,350
countless times at comedy clubs so
many times at comedy clubs. Oh yeah.

2416
02:23:35,351 --> 02:23:37,870
Mock indignation. And
there's, it's always like,

2417
02:23:37,900 --> 02:23:41,020
it's like a lingering group like people
or have left the show and you're like,

2418
02:23:41,260 --> 02:23:44,140
what's going on there? Why are they
here? Right. And they're like, man,

2419
02:23:44,141 --> 02:23:48,210
this shit wasn't even good
food. You brought, you ate it
and like, yeah, but it was,

2420
02:23:48,211 --> 02:23:51,130
it was bad. Like you ate
it, you didn't say anything.

2421
02:23:51,131 --> 02:23:53,920
Then they just order a shitload to like,

2422
02:23:53,921 --> 02:23:57,370
they always ordered like three appetizers
or like they just go crazy and then at

2423
02:23:57,371 --> 02:24:00,100
the end they tell you, I've seen
it, I've seen it. A restaurant,

2424
02:24:00,310 --> 02:24:04,600
a guy with a big party, the shrimp
are terrible man. These were bad.

2425
02:24:05,110 --> 02:24:08,980
Like the ones that you ate
an hour ago. Yeah. This, this
has got to go, man. I can't,

2426
02:24:09,010 --> 02:24:09,400
I mean,

2427
02:24:09,400 --> 02:24:09,740
you know,

2428
02:24:09,740 --> 02:24:14,560
there's another problem too that people
do and that's when [inaudible] go out.

2429
02:24:14,600 --> 02:24:15,220
No,

2430
02:24:15,220 --> 02:24:20,220
a bunch of people go out and one person
gets stuck paying the majority of the

2431
02:24:20,261 --> 02:24:23,280
bill. Like a lot of people don't
chip in and then they start going,

2432
02:24:23,281 --> 02:24:25,690
well what the fuck man? And then
then people will start complaining,

2433
02:24:25,691 --> 02:24:26,890
well this wasn't even going good.

2434
02:24:27,220 --> 02:24:30,850
I've seen that happen so many times where
people don't pay their share or they

2435
02:24:30,851 --> 02:24:34,570
conveniently ignore the fact that the
check has gone there and start getting up

2436
02:24:34,571 --> 02:24:37,840
and grabbing their keys. They don't even
act like they're going to contribute.

2437
02:24:38,120 --> 02:24:41,710
Like I've seen that happen many times
where people like one person shells in

2438
02:24:41,711 --> 02:24:43,480
like 20 and then a while mom put,

2439
02:24:43,481 --> 02:24:46,420
I'll put in 40 but mine was
only 20 and then there's like,

2440
02:24:46,430 --> 02:24:48,930
well then he put it 40 shit. I don't
have to put in anything. Right?

2441
02:24:49,010 --> 02:24:52,900
Like people have all got weird
logic when it comes to paying a bill

2442
02:24:53,150 --> 02:24:56,150
that happens every night going to norms,
you know all the comics,

2443
02:24:56,151 --> 02:24:59,840
like 20 comics all sitting
there and you're like, wait
a second. I gave 40 bucks.

2444
02:24:59,841 --> 02:25:03,020
Why didn't you know that's not
good all the time came for it.

2445
02:25:03,021 --> 02:25:07,160
Half the time nowadays
where I was planning on,

2446
02:25:07,730 --> 02:25:10,520
you know, everyone chipping in
something, I'm like, I really,

2447
02:25:10,521 --> 02:25:15,521
I have to bust out credit card
and pay a crazy amount more.

2448
02:25:15,630 --> 02:25:15,850
Yeah,

2449
02:25:15,850 --> 02:25:16,331
yeah.
That,

2450
02:25:16,331 --> 02:25:19,930
that can become a problem and it also
becomes a problem if they expect you to

2451
02:25:19,931 --> 02:25:22,030
pay. Like if you pay a couple
of times they're like, yeah,

2452
02:25:22,031 --> 02:25:25,090
red panel pay and then to start
order ordering omelets and shit.

2453
02:25:25,390 --> 02:25:28,150
Hashbrowns and like, yeah, I
wasn't going to get orange juice,

2454
02:25:28,151 --> 02:25:30,160
but fucking red bands going to Brian.
He's got my back.

2455
02:25:30,161 --> 02:25:32,740
I was going to have some ice water, but
I'm pretty sure red man is going to pay.

2456
02:25:32,920 --> 02:25:35,620
I'll get that. Steak and eggs. Yeah.

2457
02:25:35,621 --> 02:25:38,050
I just throw it down to 20 at
that point where it's as easy,

2458
02:25:38,051 --> 02:25:40,750
like $5 more than I should. It'd
be all right. Here's my, you know,

2459
02:25:40,930 --> 02:25:41,741
you have to do that every year.

2460
02:25:41,741 --> 02:25:45,700
You can see people doing that though if
you're around long, especially comics.

2461
02:25:45,740 --> 02:25:47,170
So opportunistic man,

2462
02:25:47,650 --> 02:25:52,650
the struggling comic is one of the
sleaziest most least trustworthy animal in

2463
02:25:52,870 --> 02:25:57,870
all of entertainment because they're like
park criminal part artists all wrapped

2464
02:25:59,021 --> 02:26:01,660
up together. Like how many struggling
comics do we know that early?

2465
02:26:02,130 --> 02:26:06,250
Just a hair from being a criminal.
Yeah. Well they're homeless people.

2466
02:26:06,251 --> 02:26:09,160
They all live in their cars. There's
a lot of that. Hollywood hills.

2467
02:26:09,190 --> 02:26:10,660
You always take care of shit though.

2468
02:26:10,750 --> 02:26:15,160
Like I've been turned down to pay stuff
by you every time I've ever. Yeah.

2469
02:26:15,161 --> 02:26:18,550
But that's when we're working together.
That's what, when we work together,

2470
02:26:18,551 --> 02:26:20,620
I take care of everything.
That's the deal.

2471
02:26:20,650 --> 02:26:24,280
Does it really take care of all the hotel?
I take all the meals. Awesome. Carol.

2472
02:26:24,281 --> 02:26:28,450
But it's, uh, I think the way you're
supposed to deal with it, you know,

2473
02:26:28,540 --> 02:26:33,390
it's not your job to be there with me. You
know, your job is to do your show. Yeah.

2474
02:26:33,700 --> 02:26:35,830
So all the other time,
all the other stuff during the day,

2475
02:26:35,831 --> 02:26:39,070
like that takes away from you the
amount of money that you make it a Gig.

2476
02:26:39,370 --> 02:26:39,611
You know,

2477
02:26:39,611 --> 02:26:42,460
if you have to worry about paying all
your meals and paying for our hotel and

2478
02:26:42,461 --> 02:26:45,670
paying for this, for paying for that,
that seems just like bullshit to me.

2479
02:26:45,671 --> 02:26:49,510
Like know when you're on the road, you
know you're my guest. That's nice. I have,

2480
02:26:49,540 --> 02:26:50,370
it's very nice. Yeah. I,

2481
02:26:50,370 --> 02:26:55,370
I have friends that I've brought on
the road who assume that I'm in that

2482
02:26:55,631 --> 02:27:00,100
position to really, I didn't bring, I'm
like, yeah, you know, I got you this week.

2483
02:27:00,101 --> 02:27:03,730
And then like they were just like,
let's go out to eat, let's say no.

2484
02:27:03,731 --> 02:27:07,450
And then the bill comes in and you're
like, Hey man, uh, yours was 50 bucks.

2485
02:27:07,720 --> 02:27:12,490
What do you want to do? I don't have 53
days. And what do they, what do you say,

2486
02:27:13,620 --> 02:27:17,840
bitch? Yeah, I mean, you know, certain
point you're just like, all right,

2487
02:27:17,940 --> 02:27:22,120
I'm not going to make a fucking scene
out of it unless it were like real

2488
02:27:22,121 --> 02:27:25,600
significant. I'm just like,
all right man, good date.

2489
02:27:26,260 --> 02:27:29,680
So they just assume that you were going
to pay. I've had that happen for sure.

2490
02:27:29,740 --> 02:27:33,310
That's hilarious. Of course it doesn't
seem like something would be normal.

2491
02:27:33,311 --> 02:27:33,970
In fact,

2492
02:27:33,970 --> 02:27:38,590
one of the reasons why I chose to do
that from the get go was all the people

2493
02:27:38,591 --> 02:27:42,040
that would complain about like being on
the road with someone and how much money

2494
02:27:42,041 --> 02:27:45,400
it would cost. Oh right. Yeah, yeah.
And we've got to pay for all my meals.

2495
02:27:45,401 --> 02:27:47,470
So like at the end of the day I don't
make any money and I'm like, yeah,

2496
02:27:47,471 --> 02:27:49,930
you know why you don't make any money
cause you can't even eat your food.

2497
02:27:49,931 --> 02:27:53,270
Do you have at home? You know you got
to eat out every meal. Right. You know,

2498
02:27:53,290 --> 02:27:56,870
and there's, you know, there's no
reason for that. I think if you,

2499
02:27:56,871 --> 02:27:57,760
if a guy's doing well,

2500
02:27:57,940 --> 02:28:02,380
did you see about that guy is just
not a comic but there's a guy,

2501
02:28:02,440 --> 02:28:06,820
it was a video as a clip
we played on my podcast.

2502
02:28:06,821 --> 02:28:11,590
On your mom's house. How
the guy who's like get your
hands off my penis. That guy,

2503
02:28:12,430 --> 02:28:14,230
that guy. My Dad. So my dad

2504
02:28:16,110 --> 02:28:20,640
is that your hands off my
peanut. This guy, if you look
at this guy, he, he does is,

2505
02:28:20,960 --> 02:28:22,160
he's doing exactly

2506
02:28:22,160 --> 02:28:25,220
what we're talking about.
He became famous for this in Australia,

2507
02:28:25,670 --> 02:28:29,510
which is he would go out to five star
meals like in restaurants and then when

2508
02:28:29,511 --> 02:28:33,860
the bill came he would just go, I don't
have any money. And they were like,

2509
02:28:34,250 --> 02:28:37,490
what? And He'd be like, I just
don't have any money. Like I'm,

2510
02:28:37,580 --> 02:28:38,413
I don't have any money.

2511
02:28:39,500 --> 02:28:44,500
And most of the time they didn't want
to create scenes in these places so he'd

2512
02:28:44,541 --> 02:28:48,520
get thrown out sometimes he would fake
a heart attack and like he's like, ah,

2513
02:28:48,660 --> 02:28:49,820
and they call an ambulance.

2514
02:28:50,480 --> 02:28:53,840
So the priority was on
getting him to a hospital.

2515
02:28:54,710 --> 02:28:58,580
He became like the most famous guy for
doing this to the point where he had

2516
02:28:58,610 --> 02:29:02,750
multiple court appearances and
like judges would like, you know,

2517
02:29:03,130 --> 02:29:07,010
be like you're a disgrace to
humanity and the way this is such a,

2518
02:29:07,210 --> 02:29:09,020
and he'd be like, I'm a
terrible person. I know

2519
02:29:10,760 --> 02:29:12,650
it's one of the funniest
videos in the world.

2520
02:29:13,510 --> 02:29:15,200
This is him out of coming
out of a restaurant,

2521
02:29:25,830 --> 02:29:26,663
manifests,

2522
02:29:34,840 --> 02:29:36,320
he's fighting against the cops.

2523
02:29:42,070 --> 02:29:43,300
Got me on the penis.

2524
02:30:07,430 --> 02:30:08,263
Penis.

2525
02:30:15,190 --> 02:30:17,410
I love how it ends.
Farewell

2526
02:30:18,920 --> 02:30:22,820
Guy was for the hundredth time.
They all knew him.

2527
02:30:23,380 --> 02:30:26,440
That's what was going on there. They're
like, you're the same fucking asshole.

2528
02:30:27,070 --> 02:30:29,650
What a crazy fuck.
What if you ran a restaurant?

2529
02:30:29,651 --> 02:30:31,300
What a pain in the ass to
guy like that would be,

2530
02:30:31,690 --> 02:30:35,200
takes advantage of every other
people being nice in the rules.

2531
02:30:35,230 --> 02:30:38,740
And he would also order like
extraordinary bottles of wine. Yes.

2532
02:30:39,040 --> 02:30:43,990
I'm this horse and then he put the course.
You probably also runs red lights.

2533
02:30:43,991 --> 02:30:48,700
It's not for me. It's for you. Chess
master. He is. He was, he's dead. Yes.

2534
02:30:48,790 --> 02:30:50,140
Really?
What's his name?

2535
02:30:50,620 --> 02:30:55,360
Um. Oh that guy died. Yeah, he's
died. Um, I don't mind. I don't know.

2536
02:30:55,361 --> 02:30:58,590
Three, I think his last
name. I think it was dos.

2537
02:30:58,780 --> 02:31:03,340
D. O. U. Z. A. D. O. U. Z. I think so. Um,

2538
02:31:04,210 --> 02:31:08,460
and they think he might've been, you know,
mentally ill as well. Know what Robert?

2539
02:31:08,461 --> 02:31:12,450
Hey, it kind of reminds me of
Robert. It's Dope D'souza. Okay.

2540
02:31:12,850 --> 02:31:17,530
D s o u. S a Hungarian guy. Yeah.

2541
02:31:17,560 --> 02:31:21,020
In Australia. Yeah. That was his,

2542
02:31:21,080 --> 02:31:26,080
that was his suck you in Chinese male
suck Chinese bill by them peanuts.

2543
02:31:28,460 --> 02:31:31,430
I think that's the man.
Me and Tommy are going to be on the road.

2544
02:31:31,580 --> 02:31:34,850
Hold on a second. Let's figure this out.
You know that's not there man. I'm man,

2545
02:31:34,851 --> 02:31:38,060
I'm coming up the wrong name.
Wrong name. Yeah. That's not him.

2546
02:31:38,480 --> 02:31:42,170
What does it say on that video?
You just play Brian Mann.

2547
02:31:42,390 --> 02:31:43,550
Australian man.

2548
02:31:43,970 --> 02:31:46,130
Get your hands off my penis,
man.

2549
02:31:50,040 --> 02:31:51,030
That's not the guy.

2550
02:31:52,230 --> 02:31:53,120
MMM.

2551
02:31:54,080 --> 02:31:55,430
Not,
not the Souza.

2552
02:31:58,410 --> 02:32:00,020
Just sit as Australian man.

2553
02:32:00,960 --> 02:32:04,820
Oh, here it is. I'll see the guy there.

2554
02:32:06,610 --> 02:32:10,270
Yeah. Just it doesn't say in any of the
videos on youtube at least that I see.

2555
02:32:10,760 --> 02:32:11,140
Okay.

2556
02:32:11,140 --> 02:32:13,960
Um, I've, I see the video on live leak

2557
02:32:14,940 --> 02:32:16,140
item info.

2558
02:32:17,920 --> 02:32:19,750
Get your hands off my pay.
Nice.

2559
02:32:20,750 --> 02:32:21,583
Hmm.

2560
02:32:21,590 --> 02:32:23,840
So apparently he was a chess master.

2561
02:32:25,530 --> 02:32:26,363
Yeah.

2562
02:32:26,560 --> 02:32:29,320
Paul here. Paul Dozo,
right? Yeah. Paul Paul.

2563
02:32:29,321 --> 02:32:32,410
Charles doza dubbed the restaurant runner.

2564
02:32:33,550 --> 02:32:37,750
He was a chess master. Wow. Check night.

2565
02:32:38,320 --> 02:32:42,700
A former chef who dines at expensive
restaurants and then pleads poverty has

2566
02:32:42,701 --> 02:32:47,701
been convicted for the 54th time
of refusing to pay for a meal.

2567
02:32:49,290 --> 02:32:52,940
Can Paul Charles Dozer, he
was only 48. They're dub.

2568
02:32:52,941 --> 02:32:57,941
The restaurant runner by local newspapers
was fined $180 on Monday for refusing

2569
02:32:58,961 --> 02:33:03,790
to pay a $50 bill at a Chinese restaurant.
The following day he dined out.

2570
02:33:05,410 --> 02:33:09,640
He dined out at the five star,
Sheraton Wentworth hotel.

2571
02:33:09,641 --> 02:33:13,180
Then told the staff that he could
not pay the $48 check. He was fine.

2572
02:33:13,181 --> 02:33:17,470
$200 for that offense on Wednesday and
order to compensate the restaurant.

2573
02:33:17,500 --> 02:33:18,970
Dozer pleaded guilty,

2574
02:33:18,971 --> 02:33:22,900
but the charge is saying that he
was in a state of inebriation.

2575
02:33:23,600 --> 02:33:24,500
Hmm Huh.

2576
02:33:26,410 --> 02:33:31,410
He was a Hungarian master chess player
and the leading junior drawing with

2577
02:33:31,850 --> 02:33:33,880
portage,
et Cetera,

2578
02:33:33,900 --> 02:33:38,770
in between and in depth bracken.
I don't even know how to say this.

2579
02:33:39,070 --> 02:33:40,210
In 1956

2580
02:33:40,690 --> 02:33:45,310
wow. This says that, um, he
sometimes he would eat, drink,

2581
02:33:45,311 --> 02:33:49,450
say he was very ill, ask for an
ambulance to be called out of concern.

2582
02:33:49,451 --> 02:33:50,284
They would take him.

2583
02:33:50,560 --> 02:33:53,680
But then one night he was caught when
the same ambulance driver picked him up.

2584
02:33:53,710 --> 02:33:57,220
If I am a different restaurant,
um, oh, that's so funny.

2585
02:33:57,280 --> 02:34:00,910
And he sometimes rented a luxurious
apartment paying advanced rent,

2586
02:34:01,390 --> 02:34:04,240
hired expensive furniture,
I guess rented that,

2587
02:34:04,300 --> 02:34:06,220
sold the furniture and then disappeared.

2588
02:34:08,940 --> 02:34:12,450
Wow. Yeah. There's people that
don't play by the rules man,

2589
02:34:13,860 --> 02:34:17,070
and there's people that are just fucking
crazy to like, who knows? I mean,

2590
02:34:17,080 --> 02:34:19,300
this guy easily could have
been some sort of a sociopath.

2591
02:34:19,330 --> 02:34:20,980
It could have been just completely nuts.

2592
02:34:23,020 --> 02:34:26,110
It's funny though that someone would
be a chess master and that would be

2593
02:34:26,111 --> 02:34:29,650
something that would be into doing. Can
I get the check night? I mean, it really,

2594
02:34:29,651 --> 02:34:34,390
if you can deal with the actual shame
of being told that you're, you know,

2595
02:34:34,391 --> 02:34:37,300
you're the delinquent and you're not
paying. If you can deal with that,

2596
02:34:37,301 --> 02:34:40,720
you just got an amazing meal that you
can never afford and you just keep doing

2597
02:34:40,721 --> 02:34:45,100
it over and over again. It doesn't bother
you in the slightest. Oh yeah. You don't.

2598
02:34:45,101 --> 02:34:49,660
I saw a, that's fucking hilarious.
The world's end. Oh yeah.

2599
02:34:49,661 --> 02:34:54,170
Simon pub crawl. Simon Pegg. Yeah.
Yeah. Fucking funny movie, Dude.

2600
02:34:54,280 --> 02:34:57,670
Fuck. Those guys are all integrated
together. That was his best one.

2601
02:34:57,760 --> 02:35:00,610
I like Shaun of the dead. Shaun of
the dead was good. This was better.

2602
02:35:00,880 --> 02:35:05,410
This was really fucking funny. It was
really good, man. It was interesting.

2603
02:35:05,411 --> 02:35:07,780
It's like, I don't want to say
too much. I don't to give it away,

2604
02:35:07,781 --> 02:35:09,220
but it's like two different movies.

2605
02:35:09,550 --> 02:35:12,760
It's like you're watching one movie and
then also in the movie changes sort of

2606
02:35:12,761 --> 02:35:15,820
like when dusk till dawn. You remember
in the beginning of dusk till dawn,

2607
02:35:15,821 --> 02:35:18,100
like super like serious,

2608
02:35:18,370 --> 02:35:22,030
like the action thriller and then it
becomes as Wacky, Zany vampire movie.

2609
02:35:22,750 --> 02:35:25,510
This is not quite as extreme,

2610
02:35:25,570 --> 02:35:27,900
but very a very two,

2611
02:35:27,910 --> 02:35:32,410
two very distinctly different films
and fucking great man. It's great.

2612
02:35:32,980 --> 02:35:37,630
I really enjoy the shit. I laughed out
loud like really hard a couple of times.

2613
02:35:37,631 --> 02:35:40,270
And then the theater right now. Yes.
Yes, it's right. It's right now.

2614
02:35:40,930 --> 02:35:45,130
I laughed like really good stuff, man.

2615
02:35:45,550 --> 02:35:47,780
I really liked him. I liked the
other guy to the big guy. Oh,

2616
02:35:47,800 --> 02:35:51,880
the big guy was amazing. He
steals the movie. He's a big
guy. The Shit. Yeah. Yeah.

2617
02:35:51,940 --> 02:35:54,640
It was incredible. Man is incredible
and they're always together.

2618
02:35:54,641 --> 02:35:56,050
Those two make a lot of movies together,
right?

2619
02:35:56,080 --> 02:36:00,490
They're always doing stuff
together. Yeah. Yeah, they did.

2620
02:36:00,670 --> 02:36:03,880
They did. Shaun of the dead was
the one they did with the, um,

2621
02:36:04,690 --> 02:36:08,870
it was like hot fuzz. Fuzz. Yeah. That's
when there was like the killer. Right.

2622
02:36:08,890 --> 02:36:11,600
Until I love that. I love
all of those. Yeah. Shot Him.

2623
02:36:11,601 --> 02:36:14,410
My Dad's one of my favorite movies. He,
yeah, he's a bad motherfucker. The guy.

2624
02:36:14,411 --> 02:36:17,500
It's just funny. He's just
funny. I mean, his sensibilities,

2625
02:36:17,501 --> 02:36:20,500
he's just really good at being funny.
Yeah. You know, for whatever reason.

2626
02:36:20,610 --> 02:36:23,410
What's funny though, when I put
it on Twitter, everybody was like,

2627
02:36:23,411 --> 02:36:27,910
don't you mean this is the end, right?
Like the, the same, it's really similar.

2628
02:36:27,970 --> 02:36:31,760
So Seth Rogan, they're like correcting
me and I'm like, no, fuck heads. Yeah.

2629
02:36:31,870 --> 02:36:34,060
I wouldn't say that also
though. Yeah. That looks good.

2630
02:36:34,090 --> 02:36:37,420
I heard good things about that. I
would see any of that. It looks good.

2631
02:36:37,840 --> 02:36:40,080
James Franco, was that right? Yeah.
James frightened. They have like, uh,

2632
02:36:40,110 --> 02:36:44,850
a lot of cameos in that. Oh
yeah. Yeah, a lot. Well, I mean,

2633
02:36:44,860 --> 02:36:49,840
Craig Robinson, that whole crew with
Jonah Hill, Michael, uh, Michael Cera,

2634
02:36:49,841 --> 02:36:52,210
like all the guys that you've
seen in those movies separately,

2635
02:36:52,211 --> 02:36:55,660
all make appearances, I think. Why
are so many chess players crazy.

2636
02:36:56,200 --> 02:36:59,400
I was just thinking about that. Somebody
show up, put up a photo of Bobby Fischer,

2637
02:36:59,530 --> 02:37:03,560
he and he's nuts. Oh my God.
Crazy racist too, right? Uh,

2638
02:37:03,760 --> 02:37:07,810
anti-semite like big time and it
takes that one. What's that about?

2639
02:37:08,130 --> 02:37:09,730
She just had a whole thing about like,

2640
02:37:09,731 --> 02:37:14,731
he hated Jews and then
they've found out that he was,

2641
02:37:15,050 --> 02:37:18,550
uh, actually part Jewish
Jewish and origin. Yeah, yeah,

2642
02:37:20,540 --> 02:37:24,170
yeah. So he's trying to throw him off the
tracks. You'll be like, how Ted Haggard,

2643
02:37:24,200 --> 02:37:27,260
we talk bad about gay people.
Yeah. But he wasn't like,

2644
02:37:28,190 --> 02:37:31,100
he wasn't the older he got,
I think the crazier Fisher got,

2645
02:37:31,280 --> 02:37:33,950
he wasn't even subtle about it,
man. He was very much like, well,

2646
02:37:34,430 --> 02:37:37,520
you know what I think is also an issue
with a guy like Bobby Fisher that he's

2647
02:37:37,521 --> 02:37:41,360
just so fucking smart and so crazy.
Too smart for his own good.

2648
02:37:41,390 --> 02:37:42,990
If you ever seen those videos,
Brian,

2649
02:37:43,000 --> 02:37:46,700
see we can pull this up where Bobby
Fischer would play multiple games of chess

2650
02:37:46,701 --> 02:37:47,540
simultaneously.

2651
02:37:47,900 --> 02:37:51,230
He would walk in a room and they would
all be playing and he would walk down the

2652
02:37:51,231 --> 02:37:55,610
aisle and make his moves at like 16
different tables at the same time and then

2653
02:37:55,611 --> 02:37:56,444
just Kinda,

2654
02:37:56,630 --> 02:38:00,230
he's playing them all in his head at
the same time he was playing them all.

2655
02:38:00,650 --> 02:38:05,650
He had an all the games calculated up
in his head running simultaneously.

2656
02:38:06,200 --> 02:38:10,090
All he did was chess. Man, that hurts or
is it for an era? It hurts my deck. Yeah.

2657
02:38:10,100 --> 02:38:14,090
I feel it in my deck
and a tip to the base.

2658
02:38:14,091 --> 02:38:16,940
That's too much work on craziness.

2659
02:38:17,690 --> 02:38:22,520
When I see someone who just completely
engulfed by something like that,

2660
02:38:22,760 --> 02:38:26,150
that's just like a some super master
that's completely engulfed in something

2661
02:38:26,151 --> 02:38:29,900
like chess kind of freaks me out.
Yeah, it's scary. It freaks me out.

2662
02:38:29,990 --> 02:38:33,200
I don't know where the Ma, I searched
for multiple chess games. Probably fish.

2663
02:38:33,230 --> 02:38:36,710
That's not it because you don't,
you don't watch the actual game itself.

2664
02:38:36,711 --> 02:38:41,711
You Watch him walking into a room and
he's playing all these games at the same

2665
02:38:41,811 --> 02:38:44,450
time. There's a great
documentary about him, doesn't,

2666
02:38:44,460 --> 02:38:47,260
he did look up multiple
simultaneous pool games.

2667
02:38:47,261 --> 02:38:51,500
I put Bobby Fischer multiple
chats games. He, um,

2668
02:38:52,160 --> 02:38:55,310
who like took him in and in the end I
think it was like Iceland or something.

2669
02:38:56,660 --> 02:39:00,170
Iceland. Someone did write. Somebody
gave him, yeah. Okay. Casbar off.

2670
02:39:00,190 --> 02:39:02,840
We'll pull up Casbar off. You
could find him doing it. Um,

2671
02:39:03,020 --> 02:39:06,380
Caspar off simultaneous chess game.

2672
02:39:06,980 --> 02:39:10,310
There's a Casbar off walking in the room.

2673
02:39:10,700 --> 02:39:15,180
He's another super genius and it's
like a gang of people here. Oh yeah.

2674
02:39:15,560 --> 02:39:16,610
It's crazy,
man.

2675
02:39:17,380 --> 02:39:20,930
This guy just walking down this
huge table when all these geniuses,

2676
02:39:20,931 --> 02:39:23,510
they have notebooks and pencils and shit.

2677
02:39:23,960 --> 02:39:28,400
They're all studying each move and
kiss bar off, walks in and like,

2678
02:39:28,401 --> 02:39:32,270
literally within seconds he's made a
move. Look at this. Boehm Bitch. You Dad,

2679
02:39:32,840 --> 02:39:36,740
you're fucked. Here. Me. Fuck
that. Well, you got to do
here. You Ain't gonna do shit,

2680
02:39:36,741 --> 02:39:41,720
bitch. Suck on that. Oh, you can go
fuck yourself. And how about oh bitch,

2681
02:39:41,760 --> 02:39:46,580
you crazy. Oh, I see what you're doing.
Bam. Slam. Checkmate socket. Wow.

2682
02:39:46,581 --> 02:39:49,700
This is like dozens of people.
He's playing insane. Yeah,

2683
02:39:50,560 --> 02:39:54,470
thank is bar off would just do
this on a regular basis. I mean,

2684
02:39:54,471 --> 02:39:55,790
look at a couple tables of people.

2685
02:39:56,120 --> 02:40:01,120
Three huge long tables of people and he
looks over each chessboard no more than

2686
02:40:02,391 --> 02:40:06,090
15 seconds. He just looks at him and
go, Oh, this is actually a long way,

2687
02:40:06,130 --> 02:40:10,250
but this one, it's got a huge boner.
Is Dick's getting hard as fuck?

2688
02:40:10,410 --> 02:40:14,640
I was playing a guy. That's good guy.
Must be good. Yeah, look, he's paused.

2689
02:40:14,970 --> 02:40:18,720
He has to pause. I moved. Oh Shit.
That was a little kid. Right?

2690
02:40:18,721 --> 02:40:21,330
He's like not that good fun face.
Look that kid like how old are you?

2691
02:40:21,331 --> 02:40:25,260
You live with? Fuck. I
wonder if there's a limit.

2692
02:40:25,290 --> 02:40:28,020
I wonder if he gets like 100
tables in his fucking head explodes

2693
02:40:30,220 --> 02:40:33,530
certain amount of tables he could
do. Is he just like, like I,

2694
02:40:33,531 --> 02:40:37,210
I don't play chess on the
Chinese checkers, but like
when he looks at it, does he,

2695
02:40:37,600 --> 02:40:41,800
is it like a math equation almost to him
or is he really thinking in his head or

2696
02:40:41,801 --> 02:40:44,440
is it something that he can just
look at the table? I'm go, all right,

2697
02:40:44,441 --> 02:40:46,730
I see what's going on here.
You know what I mean? At

2698
02:40:46,750 --> 02:40:50,680
that level has played
thousands of chess games,

2699
02:40:50,710 --> 02:40:54,550
like many thousands and
knows the possibilities.

2700
02:40:55,420 --> 02:41:00,190
His level is, he has played them.
He's also done them himself.

2701
02:41:00,191 --> 02:41:04,390
Like I want to try this route and that
is like, it's a map to him for sure.

2702
02:41:04,420 --> 02:41:09,040
He's seen the whole thing and goes, I know
how this can go. I'm going to do this.

2703
02:41:09,400 --> 02:41:09,971
Yeah,
I agree.

2704
02:41:09,971 --> 02:41:13,810
It seems like there's a certain level
that they get where they see things just

2705
02:41:13,811 --> 02:41:16,750
completely differently
and then you and I would,

2706
02:41:16,900 --> 02:41:20,590
it's almost like gritted out for him.
He sees the possibilities play out.

2707
02:41:22,270 --> 02:41:26,140
There's also games where there play
three chess games simultaneously.

2708
02:41:26,141 --> 02:41:30,490
It's like a separate board. Have you
ever seen that? Oh, it's, I don't,

2709
02:41:30,640 --> 02:41:34,990
I've seen like this much
larger board and like three,

2710
02:41:35,200 --> 02:41:38,860
three different sets of pieces are all
going at it at the same time. Yeah.

2711
02:41:39,870 --> 02:41:43,810
I don't know all of it. It's
just too much, man. It's not,

2712
02:41:44,230 --> 02:41:45,280
not enough time in the world.

2713
02:41:45,400 --> 02:41:49,270
I would like to see chess masters
versus how much pussy they get.

2714
02:41:49,540 --> 02:41:54,040
Like on a chart, like how great you
have to be like Casper off at its best.

2715
02:41:54,340 --> 02:41:57,190
How little pussy was getting
like you can't be getting any,

2716
02:41:59,380 --> 02:42:01,330
well we would like to
think they don't get any.

2717
02:42:01,360 --> 02:42:04,390
We would like to thank as men who
can't play chess would be like, yeah.

2718
02:42:04,391 --> 02:42:08,050
Being gotten any pussy. Yeah. That
would help us. Right? I, yeah,

2719
02:42:08,051 --> 02:42:09,670
I would feel better about that.
Yeah.

2720
02:42:09,700 --> 02:42:12,730
I don't want him to think that he's way
smarter than me and he gets a lot of

2721
02:42:12,760 --> 02:42:15,460
poster.
I think he,

2722
02:42:16,420 --> 02:42:20,590
I think a guy though at that level
with what he's doing, his time to,

2723
02:42:21,130 --> 02:42:24,790
to indulge in him, his interest
of pussy is not that great. Well,

2724
02:42:24,791 --> 02:42:27,070
I think there's probably
such a bad motherfucker too.

2725
02:42:27,070 --> 02:42:30,280
He probably can't even talk to regular
people. Right. Like if he, if you were,

2726
02:42:30,281 --> 02:42:31,240
if he was gay and he had it,

2727
02:42:31,241 --> 02:42:33,280
fuck you with the conversation
you would have with you.

2728
02:42:33,281 --> 02:42:36,730
It'd be like Jesus Christ. Yeah. Let
me just shut up and suck it. Yeah.

2729
02:42:36,790 --> 02:42:39,390
Try to talking to you, Tom. You don't
know shit. I don't care about football.

2730
02:42:39,970 --> 02:42:42,450
I have a hundred games going on right now
in the basement there waiting for him.

2731
02:42:42,451 --> 02:42:44,980
He sucked my cock. It's like a, it's
just a biological function, right?

2732
02:42:44,981 --> 02:42:47,890
Just I just got an empty this maybe
load right now. Well, you know,

2733
02:42:47,891 --> 02:42:50,220
that was the story of Nikola Tesla.
I mean,

2734
02:42:50,320 --> 02:42:55,070
Nikola Tesla allegedly destroyed
his sexuality. That was the, uh,

2735
02:42:55,071 --> 02:42:55,904
the quote.

2736
02:42:56,020 --> 02:43:01,020
And the idea was that he
got so flabbergasted by a
relationship that he was

2737
02:43:01,691 --> 02:43:06,550
having, it was so emotionally taxing
decided just kills deck. Really?

2738
02:43:06,610 --> 02:43:10,010
Yeah. You shock it. I
don't know. There was,

2739
02:43:10,050 --> 02:43:13,450
it's an ambiguous that he used,
that he killed his sexuality.

2740
02:43:14,410 --> 02:43:17,800
You don't think guys like Kasparov and
Fischer connected with girls who were

2741
02:43:17,801 --> 02:43:22,580
like, you're really good at chess.
Maybe I came back. They're really bad.

2742
02:43:22,590 --> 02:43:27,400
That's all you do. All those moves.
Yeah, I'm totally beat him. He,

2743
02:43:28,470 --> 02:43:32,170
I think to find that quote
because it's a really weird quote.

2744
02:43:34,100 --> 02:43:38,740
Sexual desire. Yeah. He's,
he was a weird guy man.

2745
02:43:39,820 --> 02:43:44,530
But the, the other thing about Nikola
Tesla is that he was so fucking smart.

2746
02:43:44,531 --> 02:43:46,780
You would have to be
crazy to be that smart.

2747
02:43:48,310 --> 02:43:51,790
I mean there's really no way
around it. Yeah. I think everybody,

2748
02:43:51,791 --> 02:43:55,630
all these guys fished it. All
those guys were, they were,

2749
02:43:56,590 --> 02:44:00,430
what is it like um, savant?
Yeah, they weren't, you know,

2750
02:44:00,490 --> 02:44:05,490
they couldn't have regular conversations
with Tesla also had some strange quote

2751
02:44:06,101 --> 02:44:11,101
about pulling signals from other worlds
that he was receiving communication from

2752
02:44:12,461 --> 02:44:15,760
other worlds and was getting some
ideas from out from other worlds.

2753
02:44:16,210 --> 02:44:18,940
He had a really bizarre mind.

2754
02:44:19,630 --> 02:44:23,350
But the thing about it is you
can't deny the effectiveness of it.

2755
02:44:23,351 --> 02:44:28,351
It's real weird when someone is
an obvious genuine 100% bonafide,

2756
02:44:29,350 --> 02:44:34,120
super genius to the point where a guy
like me can't even understand how this guy

2757
02:44:34,121 --> 02:44:38,890
could come up with 70 patents.
I mean he had so many fucking patents,

2758
02:44:39,370 --> 02:44:44,370
so many different like
light and illumination based
systems designed by Tesla,

2759
02:44:45,220 --> 02:44:48,010
dynamic electric machine communicators.

2760
02:44:48,011 --> 02:44:52,120
The first patterns issues to
Tesla and the u s he, he just,

2761
02:44:52,420 --> 02:44:55,600
he just did a amazing shitty
developed alternating current.

2762
02:44:55,810 --> 02:44:59,590
Like before that was just direct car,
you couldn't have like a toaster and lag,

2763
02:44:59,591 --> 02:45:04,540
a car plugged into the same port and
he designed it so designed alternating

2764
02:45:04,600 --> 02:45:06,820
current.
So that would work with different shit.

2765
02:45:07,450 --> 02:45:12,450
Do you think that like the reason like
we are designed so that it doesn't

2766
02:45:12,881 --> 02:45:17,620
frustrate us how much smarter
people like that are? Yes. Yeah.

2767
02:45:17,621 --> 02:45:19,980
Like what the math thing that
we were talking about, I think,

2768
02:45:20,500 --> 02:45:23,200
I think there's a giant spectrum
of human beings, first of all.

2769
02:45:23,201 --> 02:45:26,710
And I think that there's a reason why
personalities vary so much and I think

2770
02:45:26,711 --> 02:45:30,450
it's part of the whole machine that keeps
society moving. Yeah. It's like that.

2771
02:45:30,451 --> 02:45:33,670
There has to be jokers and there have
to be serious people and they have to,

2772
02:45:33,671 --> 02:45:37,180
or people that are obsessive about things
and there have to be people who are

2773
02:45:37,181 --> 02:45:38,014
lazy.

2774
02:45:38,080 --> 02:45:42,070
They just had to be people that accept
shitty jobs and people that want the best

2775
02:45:42,071 --> 02:45:43,530
of everything always.

2776
02:45:43,540 --> 02:45:47,140
And you have this insatiable desire to
get the most expensive car and the most

2777
02:45:47,141 --> 02:45:51,190
expensive wife, if they're almost
like machines pushing entropy,

2778
02:45:51,400 --> 02:45:55,510
they're almost like machines pushing
momentum and it's like these various

2779
02:45:55,690 --> 02:46:00,160
different variations and personality
from the full spectrum of incredibly lazy

2780
02:46:00,161 --> 02:46:01,450
to insanely ambitious.

2781
02:46:01,800 --> 02:46:05,560
It's almost like that's an important that
it all mixes together and acts as like

2782
02:46:05,561 --> 02:46:08,410
a machine. You know?
I, that's what I think.

2783
02:46:08,440 --> 02:46:13,280
I mean it makes sense to me that
everything that we see is natural.

2784
02:46:13,370 --> 02:46:17,870
All behaviors natural. Well
that's behavior and wolves
are honeybees or you know,

2785
02:46:17,930 --> 02:46:21,410
coyotes, whatever it is,
behavior of animals is natural,

2786
02:46:21,411 --> 02:46:24,860
including almost all the behavior
that human beings exhibit including

2787
02:46:24,861 --> 02:46:25,760
materialism.

2788
02:46:26,060 --> 02:46:30,770
And then it's almost like materialism
is just another way that we can show our

2789
02:46:30,830 --> 02:46:35,240
peacock feathers and our domination
outside of actual physical contest and

2790
02:46:35,241 --> 02:46:35,840
fighting.

2791
02:46:35,840 --> 02:46:39,500
And that we've figured out this
variable where a guy does not have to be

2792
02:46:39,501 --> 02:46:42,500
handsome but does not have to be,
have great genetics.

2793
02:46:42,501 --> 02:46:46,100
But if he's got a brilliant mind,
like a Bill Gates type character,

2794
02:46:46,280 --> 02:46:50,390
he could rise to the top and be like
one of the sexiest catches a woman could

2795
02:46:50,391 --> 02:46:53,720
ever hope for you. Let me, supermodels
would love to go out with Bill Gates.

2796
02:46:53,990 --> 02:46:57,230
All my goodness it, Bill Gates was
single. Let's just say it. Bill Gates,

2797
02:46:57,630 --> 02:46:58,820
and he just decided,
you know what?

2798
02:46:59,000 --> 02:47:03,590
I'm 70 it's time to slink Dick and
Bill Gates just went on a Goddamn tear.

2799
02:47:03,800 --> 02:47:08,780
If he could get the hottest, most perfect
women and they would be flabbergasted.

2800
02:47:08,781 --> 02:47:12,480
They were Bill Gates. Yeah. God, I
can't believe it. Oh yeah. Just below.

2801
02:47:12,481 --> 02:47:15,170
How do I want to be yours, honey, baby,
I'm you. I don't care about looks.

2802
02:47:15,340 --> 02:47:19,940
It's what's important to
me. Yeah. Awesome. You're so
amazing. You're so kind to me.

2803
02:47:20,160 --> 02:47:23,690
She just wants to cuddle with them and
take cock and diamonds and just get

2804
02:47:23,870 --> 02:47:24,680
diamonds everyday.

2805
02:47:24,680 --> 02:47:27,430
New diamonds and diamonds
here and everything is made
of diamonds or whole house

2806
02:47:27,431 --> 02:47:28,264
houses.
Diamonds,

2807
02:47:29,240 --> 02:47:33,680
forget to take the pill pretty often
is going to the maybe come in oopsies.

2808
02:47:33,950 --> 02:47:37,520
Yeah. Awesome. Insurance
policy load. Yeah. But that's,

2809
02:47:37,580 --> 02:47:41,420
that's part of like this
whole evolutionary system.
It's almost like it's,

2810
02:47:41,421 --> 02:47:44,450
it's designed that way.
It's designed as being another outlet.

2811
02:47:44,451 --> 02:47:48,020
You can get the Laird Hamilton thing
where you just like this beautiful man.

2812
02:47:48,021 --> 02:47:52,860
It's gigantic. Fuck. Or you know, it
could be Wazniak, you know, cause, right,

2813
02:47:53,610 --> 02:47:57,020
right. I snag a little Chubby guy with
$1 billion in the bank. Sure. You know,

2814
02:47:57,200 --> 02:48:01,060
makes them quite attractive. Oh my God,
I'm so into surrogates. Yeah. Yeah.

2815
02:48:01,190 --> 02:48:01,881
It's weird.

2816
02:48:01,881 --> 02:48:06,290
It's these weird variations of what
makes someone attractive and these weird

2817
02:48:06,291 --> 02:48:10,400
variations and personality. It's
sort of push, push, you know,

2818
02:48:10,460 --> 02:48:12,650
the whole machine,
the homeless scene of culture.

2819
02:48:12,740 --> 02:48:17,200
Materialism also applies to like what,
what your sense of self worth. You know,

2820
02:48:17,210 --> 02:48:20,960
people get, you get things for yourself
to make yourself feel, to pump,

2821
02:48:21,020 --> 02:48:25,190
pump yourself up, you know? Yeah.
This is an expensive thing. I got it.

2822
02:48:25,191 --> 02:48:30,191
And therefore people will associate me
with this thing to Tesla invented x rays.

2823
02:48:32,880 --> 02:48:37,050
I'm investigating. Did you really?
Yeah. That's my shit. That's shit.

2824
02:48:37,740 --> 02:48:40,890
Tesla may have been the first person in
North America to accidentally capture an

2825
02:48:40,891 --> 02:48:45,450
x ray image when he tried to photograph
Mark Twain illuminated by an earlier

2826
02:48:45,451 --> 02:48:47,340
type of gas discharge tube.

2827
02:48:47,670 --> 02:48:52,670
The Geiser Tube in 1895 the only thing
captured was an image in the image was

2828
02:48:53,311 --> 02:48:55,980
the metal locking screw
on the camera lens.

2829
02:48:56,390 --> 02:49:00,600
Soon after much of Tesla's early research,
hundreds of invention models, plans,

2830
02:49:00,601 --> 02:49:04,530
notes, laboratory ideas, tools,
photographs, valued at $50,000 was lost.

2831
02:49:04,531 --> 02:49:08,810
And the Fifth Avenue Laboratory
fire of 18 five, my God laboratory,

2832
02:49:08,830 --> 02:49:13,200
Frank Wink, wink. Yeah, they
came in towards that place.

2833
02:49:13,210 --> 02:49:17,570
It shows notes,
created x rays out of money.

2834
02:49:17,590 --> 02:49:22,020
You probably got gangs many times over
for sure. Yeah, it's incredible. Credible.

2835
02:49:22,320 --> 02:49:26,070
Yeah. He had something to do with the
invention of radio waves to Jesus,

2836
02:49:26,071 --> 02:49:28,980
man of radio rather. Um, he,

2837
02:49:28,981 --> 02:49:33,981
I think he had the first radio controlled
remote controlled car or a boat.

2838
02:49:34,920 --> 02:49:36,240
He had a remote controlled boat.
Yeah.

2839
02:49:36,420 --> 02:49:41,130
1898 Tesla demonstrated a
remote controlled boat. 1898,

2840
02:49:41,131 --> 02:49:44,190
dude, I mean, what the fuck?

2841
02:49:44,550 --> 02:49:47,400
And 18 he called it tele automation.

2842
02:49:49,080 --> 02:49:51,690
Incredible.
It was in Madison Square Garden.

2843
02:49:52,530 --> 02:49:57,530
He demonstrated his electric radio
controlled boat in Madison Square Garden.

2844
02:49:58,111 --> 02:49:59,430
That's what a big deal it was.

2845
02:49:59,610 --> 02:50:04,320
They got had a remote control
boat and everybody was like gas.

2846
02:50:04,560 --> 02:50:09,520
That's so long ago to come up with
that. It is an incredible credible. He,

2847
02:50:09,570 --> 02:50:12,420
he invented a lot of shit.
A fucking spaceship to those people.

2848
02:50:12,490 --> 02:50:16,380
He was also in love with a pigeon. Really?
Yeah. He was in love with is pigeon.

2849
02:50:17,400 --> 02:50:20,280
He liked, had a special relationship
with a pigeon like Iron Mike.

2850
02:50:20,790 --> 02:50:25,320
I think it's different. Reincarnated.
Who's iron? Mike Tyson. Tyson. Yeah. No,

2851
02:50:25,620 --> 02:50:27,150
I think his relationship with the parents,

2852
02:50:27,240 --> 02:50:30,090
the pigeon might've been more romantic.
Oh,

2853
02:50:30,091 --> 02:50:33,240
see if pigeon flies away and

2854
02:50:35,040 --> 02:50:39,510
a flashlight. Yeah, go clean
your stuff in the pool. Yeah.

2855
02:50:39,511 --> 02:50:44,310
He had a lot of weird shit with
pigeons. Really. It's such a, yeah.

2856
02:50:45,270 --> 02:50:48,240
To be down for. Yeah. I love that.

2857
02:50:48,241 --> 02:50:51,420
Pigeon as a man loves a
woman and she loved me.

2858
02:50:51,720 --> 02:50:56,280
As long as I had her, there
was a purpose to my life. Yeah,

2859
02:50:56,281 --> 02:50:57,750
that's pretty,
that's spelled out right there.

2860
02:50:57,810 --> 02:51:01,680
He became a vegetarian in his later
years, living on only milk, bread,

2861
02:51:01,681 --> 02:51:06,210
honey and vegetable juices. What about
bird feed? No bird feed. That's sad.

2862
02:51:06,900 --> 02:51:09,300
That's for his first pigeon.
He loves one.

2863
02:51:09,690 --> 02:51:13,440
He bought injured pigeons back to his
hotel room to nurse back to health.

2864
02:51:13,560 --> 02:51:16,260
So he's basically, it kind of
a crazy guy. Lived in a hotel.

2865
02:51:16,470 --> 02:51:19,740
He really couldn't like take care of
himself. It was just a dirty dude.

2866
02:51:20,200 --> 02:51:23,140
Got some pigeons. I made a lot
of shit. Brian, you're like,

2867
02:51:23,230 --> 02:51:26,790
they had a lot of cool check. Listen,
there's no need to be mean to each other.

2868
02:51:27,300 --> 02:51:31,080
All right. This podcast basically
over if you love Tommy Buns,

2869
02:51:31,081 --> 02:51:35,460
like I love Tommy Buns and you live
in Toronto. Tough shit sold out.

2870
02:51:35,980 --> 02:51:39,030
Last, last I check, there was very
little tickets. It's really, yeah,

2871
02:51:39,630 --> 02:51:42,330
a submit during a handful,
but it will be me,

2872
02:51:42,390 --> 02:51:46,110
Tommy buns and Brian Cowen Thursday night.
And uh,

2873
02:51:46,170 --> 02:51:50,100
I just signed up to do the comedy
and Magic Club next weekend,

2874
02:51:50,101 --> 02:51:53,970
the 27th and the 28th.
Big Fun. I love Mike.

2875
02:51:54,030 --> 02:51:56,220
Great Guy owns that place.
Most of the beach baby.

2876
02:51:56,250 --> 02:52:01,070
And then after that I'm at the Ontario
Improv. Um, I got a lot of shit happening.
