1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,710
The joe rogan experience,

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:03,600
the Ron Paul's of the world,

3
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:04,021
you know,

4
00:00:04,021 --> 00:00:06,420
it's like to get to be a
certain age where they're just,

5
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:07,770
they don't give a fuck.

6
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:08,711
Like what are you going to do?

7
00:00:08,711 --> 00:00:09,544
Are you going to shoot him?

8
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,730
He's fucking 85 years
old or whatever he is.

9
00:00:11,731 --> 00:00:11,950
You know,

10
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:12,231
he's,

11
00:00:12,231 --> 00:00:16,470
he's last run for president has done
now it's up to his son and his son.

12
00:00:16,471 --> 00:00:18,960
Apparently he's been using cheat sheets.

13
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:23,730
Plagiarizing a lot of credit for that
wonderful filibuster we did for the fourth

14
00:00:23,731 --> 00:00:24,340
amendment,

15
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:25,500
got the best publicity,

16
00:00:25,501 --> 00:00:28,680
the fourth amendment's gotten in so
long and then you go pull that on me.

17
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:30,570
Make me look like an idiot for beef.

18
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:32,010
People don't know what
you're talking about.

19
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,650
It's apparently he had used some,

20
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:37,600
some words from some various speeches.

21
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:38,790
Exactly the same.

22
00:00:38,791 --> 00:00:39,510
Exactly.

23
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:42,700
Is it possible that he has writers and
he doesn't know that's what his father

24
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:45,420
shot the newsletters where that
got his father in so much trouble.

25
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:49,290
But remember Rand Paul who website
nice things about also has his,

26
00:00:49,291 --> 00:00:50,400
one of his main advisors,

27
00:00:50,401 --> 00:00:52,530
that guy who did the southern Avenger,

28
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:53,460
you know cafe.

29
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:53,971
Oh yeah.

30
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:54,570
The Guy,

31
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:58,140
one of his advisors was the southern
Avenger and he wore a mask and had a

32
00:00:58,141 --> 00:00:59,400
confederate flag behind him,

33
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,200
like a youtube show or something,

34
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:01,981
and then when they said it,

35
00:01:01,981 --> 00:01:02,940
you're going to fire this guy.

36
00:01:02,941 --> 00:01:03,541
He goes something like,

37
00:01:03,541 --> 00:01:03,691
well,

38
00:01:03,691 --> 00:01:06,050
that's all in his past
and you just go ice.

39
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:07,170
What's up with this?

40
00:01:07,171 --> 00:01:08,820
Why are these people all crazy?

41
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:11,050
Talk about freedom in our constitution.

42
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:11,820
You're crazy.

43
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:12,740
That's adorable.

44
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:13,070
Yeah.

45
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:15,030
Maybe it's the southern Avenger.

46
00:01:15,031 --> 00:01:15,864
Look at his photo.

47
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,530
Oh wait.

48
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:21,060
If that guy's on your staff and somebody,

49
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:22,051
you could honestly say,

50
00:01:22,051 --> 00:01:22,231
God,

51
00:01:22,231 --> 00:01:23,580
I didn't know he was a southerner venture.

52
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,900
Once they tell you,

53
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:27,630
don't you fire him five seconds later,

54
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:29,200
I think it's probably a good move.

55
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:31,411
That to me,

56
00:01:31,411 --> 00:01:31,591
right?

57
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:31,921
There you go.

58
00:01:31,921 --> 00:01:32,251
Great.

59
00:01:32,251 --> 00:01:35,790
Thanks for taking my pet issue of the
fourth amendment and trashing it with your

60
00:01:35,791 --> 00:01:36,780
southern Avenger guy.

61
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:38,400
What is the southern Avenger stance?

62
00:01:38,401 --> 00:01:39,240
Maybe I'm on his team.

63
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:39,991
Hold on us.

64
00:01:39,991 --> 00:01:42,440
I know I have never
watched the southern event.

65
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:45,750
I just clips painting
with a broad blush brush.

66
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:47,460
The confederate flag does that for you.

67
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,081
I don't know.

68
00:01:49,081 --> 00:01:50,280
What could he possibly,

69
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,620
he's confusing the shit out of me already.

70
00:01:52,621 --> 00:01:53,454
Conservative,

71
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:54,361
Libertarian,

72
00:01:54,361 --> 00:01:54,980
Independent.

73
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:55,740
What he's done,

74
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:55,941
he's,

75
00:01:55,941 --> 00:01:56,241
he's just,

76
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:56,421
he's,

77
00:01:56,421 --> 00:01:56,740
he's,

78
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:58,260
he's destroyed conservative,

79
00:01:58,261 --> 00:02:00,960
independent and libertarian
in one tag line.

80
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,250
He's probably,

81
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:02,701
you know,

82
00:02:02,701 --> 00:02:04,020
working for a group whose design,

83
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:05,730
who's trying to discredit
all of those things.

84
00:02:05,731 --> 00:02:07,860
I'm surprised it doesn't
have a TM at the end of it.

85
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:09,743
You know,

86
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,800
it's the logo.

87
00:02:10,801 --> 00:02:12,600
It's a better logo that
a lot of people have.

88
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:12,990
Yeah.

89
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:13,231
I mean,

90
00:02:13,231 --> 00:02:14,064
what does he try to do?

91
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,650
Is this guy still like a wrestler?

92
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:16,110
Doesn't eat.

93
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:16,710
He does.

94
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:17,910
Is He still have a show?

95
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:18,101
No,

96
00:02:18,101 --> 00:02:19,620
we works for Rand Paul now.

97
00:02:19,621 --> 00:02:20,454
Still.

98
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:21,930
They didn't fire him in.

99
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,860
Where's Brian?

100
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:24,260
He keeps supposed to look all that.

101
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:25,370
He's not going to look it up.

102
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:26,280
He's just going to interrupt.

103
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:27,780
Oh,

104
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:28,820
he's been panic.

105
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:31,230
Temporary banishment but ran.

106
00:02:31,231 --> 00:02:32,860
Paul still has this guy working for,

107
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:33,810
I can't imagine.

108
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:34,860
I can't comment on that.

109
00:02:34,861 --> 00:02:35,371
As we know,

110
00:02:35,371 --> 00:02:37,290
if the southern Avenger said anything bad,

111
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:38,671
he says,

112
00:02:38,671 --> 00:02:40,770
speak at the same conference as Rand Paul.

113
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:44,130
After neoconservative
alter ego was revealed.

114
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:46,240
Hunter left a post on the,

115
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:48,990
as the Kentucky senators social media.

116
00:02:48,991 --> 00:02:49,824
I'm like,

117
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,880
that's the guy that's
southern or avenger please.

118
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:52,261
I was,

119
00:02:52,261 --> 00:02:52,801
I couldn't see it.

120
00:02:52,801 --> 00:02:57,750
It looks like guys look at that photo
over his right shoulder for the left

121
00:02:57,751 --> 00:02:57,991
shoulder.

122
00:02:57,991 --> 00:02:58,710
That's disturbing.

123
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:00,130
Is that I have no shirt on.

124
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,620
There's like a bunch of people
and one guy has no shirt on.

125
00:03:02,621 --> 00:03:06,640
That's a gay orgy about
a southern gay orgy.

126
00:03:06,641 --> 00:03:07,091
They just said,

127
00:03:07,091 --> 00:03:08,950
we just have some chicken
and we're fixing to fuck.

128
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:10,120
Look at him.

129
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,550
The guy has no shirt on
and a big chest tattoo.

130
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:16,720
What if that chest tattoo was
like some fucking conservative?

131
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,220
You don't know what's
on his bank statement.

132
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:18,760
Yeah,

133
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,050
a big confederate flag.

134
00:03:20,051 --> 00:03:22,150
I'm sure the cover of the fucking,

135
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:23,450
the roof of the general duty.

136
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:24,760
How come?

137
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:29,200
Whenever you get someone who sang some
important things in a halfway decent way,

138
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:30,213
they have to come.

139
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:30,431
You know,

140
00:03:30,431 --> 00:03:31,300
people say to me all the time,

141
00:03:31,301 --> 00:03:32,490
well we vote all the time Dan.

142
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:33,910
The of course the countries on.

143
00:03:33,911 --> 00:03:36,130
Is it based on voters voting for people?

144
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:36,881
How come?

145
00:03:36,881 --> 00:03:39,520
When we get somebody who would like
to change course in a direction,

146
00:03:39,521 --> 00:03:43,870
most of us would like to see half of them
is really fantastic and the other half

147
00:03:43,871 --> 00:03:44,890
of them is so crazy.

148
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:46,780
You'd never elect a person
like that in a million years.

149
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:50,050
Why can't we have somebody who has some
common sense and it doesn't sound like

150
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:50,621
two words,

151
00:03:50,621 --> 00:03:54,430
my friend simulation theory and all
guys back and diversify risk management

152
00:03:54,431 --> 00:03:56,890
diversification tool.

153
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:57,920
Yeah.

154
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,050
I wonder,

155
00:03:59,051 --> 00:03:59,430
you know,

156
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:03,250
I think he's hedging his bets in case
white people take over the world again,

157
00:04:03,251 --> 00:04:03,521
you know,

158
00:04:03,521 --> 00:04:03,880
in in,

159
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:04,160
in a,

160
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,680
in a very dominant sort of way.

161
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:07,510
We'll have the southern Avenger on staff.

162
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:08,291
He can advise us.

163
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:12,480
You ever watched those extreme preppers
shows that little shows her dudes or,

164
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:15,430
or fix into the preparing
for the end of the world.

165
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:21,170
People stockpile and water and creating
escape routes and battering rams.

166
00:04:21,821 --> 00:04:23,650
They're welding to the front
of their pickup trucks.

167
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:26,920
The hoarders because they're the porters
that are doing it for a good cause,

168
00:04:26,921 --> 00:04:27,310
right?

169
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:27,491
Yeah.

170
00:04:27,491 --> 00:04:30,040
They believe that it's all going
to come crumbling down and those,

171
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:35,280
I think that there's an mentality and
the same kind of mentality that is the

172
00:04:36,011 --> 00:04:39,940
type of person that wants to get in
this word rebellious position of power,

173
00:04:39,941 --> 00:04:41,080
rebellious position of,

174
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:42,123
you know,

175
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:43,780
railing out against the government.

176
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:48,040
They're very similar to these people
that are prepping is very similar to the

177
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:49,390
their extreme folks.

178
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:52,750
Like those are the only people that
make it to the front of that crazy line.

179
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:54,100
They have to be a bit nutty.

180
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:57,790
It's not that the ideas aren't interesting
to you or I when look at a guy like

181
00:04:57,791 --> 00:04:58,331
ran Paul,

182
00:04:58,331 --> 00:05:01,450
the things that he says that
you agree with or his dad,

183
00:05:01,451 --> 00:05:03,130
the things that he says
that you agree with,

184
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:04,750
but it's to get there.

185
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:08,290
He's facing so much opposition.

186
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:10,000
There's so much bullshit along the way,

187
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:11,380
so much pressure,

188
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,250
so much,

189
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:15,160
so much back and forth debate.

190
00:05:15,161 --> 00:05:16,480
So much frustration,

191
00:05:16,481 --> 00:05:18,100
so much suppression of information.

192
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:21,190
By the time he gets to a position
where the world is listening to him,

193
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:22,420
he's already broken.

194
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,170
He like broke every bone in his fucking
soul just to get to the front of the

195
00:05:26,171 --> 00:05:26,950
line.

196
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:27,201
You know,

197
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:28,960
it's funny that people
say to me all the time,

198
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:29,681
you know,

199
00:05:29,681 --> 00:05:32,530
can you get a staff together to do
what you do so you can do better?

200
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:33,580
I want more history shows.

201
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:34,001
Can we,

202
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:34,834
can we help you do this?

203
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,040
And I always say the same thing.

204
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:36,311
I said,

205
00:05:36,311 --> 00:05:39,520
you can't help me because I can't watch
y'all and I can't keep track of them.

206
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:40,990
That's what all these people do.

207
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:41,230
They,

208
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:41,501
you know,

209
00:05:41,501 --> 00:05:41,960
what was it?

210
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:42,400
Uh,

211
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:42,941
Paul said,

212
00:05:42,941 --> 00:05:43,190
uh,

213
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:43,321
uh,

214
00:05:43,321 --> 00:05:43,961
Ron Paul said,

215
00:05:43,961 --> 00:05:44,111
well,

216
00:05:44,111 --> 00:05:44,944
this guy who wrote,

217
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:46,450
he was doing my newsletter for me.

218
00:05:46,451 --> 00:05:47,141
I was in Congress.

219
00:05:47,141 --> 00:05:48,140
I didn't have time to do newsletters.

220
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:50,470
So he did it and he wrote all this stuff
and I didn't know what was happening.

221
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:53,560
That's my fear is that you can hire a
bunch of people and then you're gonna turn

222
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:54,130
around and go,

223
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:55,030
what did you do for me?

224
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:55,300
What you,

225
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:57,440
which we started the southern
Avenger show for you.

226
00:05:57,441 --> 00:05:59,090
We thought that'd be a good
promotional vehicle for your show,

227
00:05:59,091 --> 00:05:59,421
Dan.

228
00:05:59,421 --> 00:05:59,990
No doubt.

229
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:00,291
Yeah,

230
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:01,070
no doubt.

231
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:02,420
I think that there's,

232
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,830
it's a catch 22 do you,

233
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:06,230
do you give away some of your
control or do you keep it,

234
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:06,621
you know,

235
00:06:06,621 --> 00:06:08,060
where you know everything's cool,

236
00:06:08,061 --> 00:06:09,110
but the minute you give it away,

237
00:06:09,111 --> 00:06:10,730
you got rogue people,

238
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:14,300
you know with your name running
around graffitiing the PSI,

239
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:15,620
Banksy and Carlin,

240
00:06:15,621 --> 00:06:16,454
we're here.

241
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:18,200
So many isolated the photograph,

242
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:18,581
pull it.

243
00:06:18,581 --> 00:06:19,490
This is the photograph.

244
00:06:19,491 --> 00:06:20,630
It's all a bunch of wrestlers.

245
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:23,180
Like a wrestler.

246
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:23,511
Yeah.

247
00:06:23,511 --> 00:06:27,080
These are like old school southern
wrestlers that I was probably right.

248
00:06:27,081 --> 00:06:28,340
They probably buff fucked each other.

249
00:06:28,341 --> 00:06:29,300
As soon as this was over.

250
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:31,590
And this guy's got this in the,

251
00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:31,990
the,

252
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:32,071
well,

253
00:06:32,071 --> 00:06:36,410
he's got it framed on his wall in
the background of his fucking study.

254
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,060
So yay.

255
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:39,110
Southern Avenger.

256
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,190
Yay.

257
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:41,420
Simulation theory.

258
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:42,740
Does it say he parted ways?

259
00:06:42,741 --> 00:06:43,161
So there so,

260
00:06:43,161 --> 00:06:44,570
so he got rid of him finally,

261
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:45,571
I guess the,

262
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:49,340
the hue and cry was a little too much
for a sitting senator from Kentucky to

263
00:06:49,341 --> 00:06:51,680
have somebody named the
southern Avenger on his staff.

264
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:51,801
Well,

265
00:06:51,801 --> 00:06:55,370
he was a cogo coauthor of
the 2011 book with Rand Paul.

266
00:06:55,371 --> 00:06:56,960
The tea party goes to watch,

267
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:58,813
maybe forgotten,

268
00:06:59,310 --> 00:06:59,930
blanked it out.

269
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:00,591
But you're right.

270
00:07:00,591 --> 00:07:00,860
It's,

271
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:02,870
it is funny that these people,

272
00:07:02,871 --> 00:07:03,830
they have to be,

273
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:05,840
we can't have a fourth
amendment person who's not.

274
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:06,291
I mean,

275
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:06,890
I guess you do,

276
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:09,260
you got guys like widen and you'd
all in some of these people,

277
00:07:09,261 --> 00:07:09,590
but,

278
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:12,500
but when you get somebody who's a
real lightening rod for this stuff.

279
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:12,770
Yeah.

280
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:13,131
And you think,

281
00:07:13,131 --> 00:07:13,731
finally,

282
00:07:13,731 --> 00:07:15,290
we've been waiting for
a guy like this forever.

283
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:18,380
They come with these poison pills
that you just can't swallow.

284
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:28,580
Okay.
