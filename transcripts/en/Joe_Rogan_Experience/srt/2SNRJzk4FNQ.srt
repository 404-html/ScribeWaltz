Is it really not for me?

8
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:20,071

00:00:20,071 --> 00:00:22,470

00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:24,720
I know how to focus my resources.

12
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:29,580
Do you think that men
do is gross to Eliza?

13
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,350
Boys are gross.

14
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:32,580
I just like my dog.

15
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:34,040
No dog.

16
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:34,800
No,

17
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,633
you're not that girl.

18
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:36,431

00:00:36,431 --> 00:00:37,264
I'm just being silly.

20
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:38,183
Anyway.

21
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:39,990
It's tough deciding where to focus.

22
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:40,680

00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:47,550

We're also brought to you by Squarespace.

you're like,

88
00:02:57,841 --> 00:02:58,290
man,

89
00:02:58,290 --> 00:02:59,230
I need to make a web page.

90
00:02:59,231 --> 00:03:00,000
But who,

91
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,850
where do I go?

92
00:03:00,851 --> 00:03:02,170
Who do I get to design it?

93
00:03:02,171 --> 00:03:02,471
I just,

94
00:03:02,471 --> 00:03:03,310
I don't know anybody.

95
00:03:03,311 --> 00:03:03,881
That's good.

96
00:03:03,881 --> 00:03:04,930
I don't want to get ripped off.

97
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:06,850
Stop right there.

98
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:09,640
Squarespace is a method.

99
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:14,710
It's a website where you can
create your own website yourself.

100
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:15,550
You can,

101
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:17,500
I could do it and I am a dummy.

102
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,880
Anyone can do it.

103
00:03:18,881 --> 00:03:20,290
It's not hard to do.

104
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:23,470
If you can do simple tasks on a computer,

105
00:03:23,471 --> 00:03:25,360
drag and drop point and click.

106
00:03:25,361 --> 00:03:27,850
If you can add a picture to an email,

107
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,160
you too can use Squarespace.

108
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:34,030
It is an excellent platform
for developing websites.

109
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,190
They have beautiful designs
for you to start with.

110
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:40,240
All the style options you need to
create a unique website for you or your

111
00:03:40,241 --> 00:03:41,074
business.

112
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:46,090
It's a simple drag and drop interface
and they offer 24 seven support.

113
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:50,320
You could also create your
own online store very easily,

114
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:51,370
very quickly.

115
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,860
You can also sell digital music.

116
00:03:53,861 --> 00:03:55,000
If you're a musician,

117
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:56,320
you can sell digital music.

118
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:59,020
If you're a guy who just likes to talk
and you want to see if maybe people will

119
00:03:59,021 --> 00:03:59,950
buy you talking,

120
00:03:59,951 --> 00:04:00,161
hey,

121
00:04:00,161 --> 00:04:01,270
fucking give it a shot.

122
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:01,840
Pow.

123
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,310
[inaudible] never know.

124
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:06,520
The point is Squarespace
has got you covered.

125
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:10,450
Plans start at $8 a month and
includes a free domain name.

126
00:04:10,451 --> 00:04:11,860
If you sign up for a year,

127
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:13,570
responsive design,

128
00:04:13,571 --> 00:04:15,910
your site will look awesome on any device,

129
00:04:15,911 --> 00:04:16,990
which is really key.

130
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:18,400
If you do it yourself,

131
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:21,820
most likely it won't look the same
on windows as it does on a Mac,

132
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:23,950
but with Squarespace they got you covered.

133
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:25,450
Whether it's android phones,

134
00:04:25,451 --> 00:04:26,590
whether it's a tablet,

135
00:04:26,591 --> 00:04:27,424
an IPAD,

136
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:29,050
it will look groovy on everything.

137
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:33,280
Squarespace also has a logo creator

141
00:04:46,841 --> 00:04:47,081
Joe,

142
00:04:47,081 --> 00:04:51,460
I can't say enough good things about
Squarespace and I like when I meet the

143
00:04:51,461 --> 00:04:54,550
people behind the company and their
coolest fuck and I met all the Squarespace

144
00:04:54,551 --> 00:04:55,384
folks.

145
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:56,380
Not all of them.

146
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:58,360
There's some squares Briggs folks
out there like what the fuck man,

147
00:04:58,361 --> 00:04:59,194
you didn't meet me.

148
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,753
I'm sorry.

149
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:01,910
I didn't mean all of them though.

150
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:05,170
I met a group that were from Squarespace
and they couldn't have been cooler,

151
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:06,940
so I love that.

152
00:05:06,941 --> 00:05:08,170

first purchase.

155
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:17,380
Another thing that I really like
about Squarespace is that you can use

156
00:05:17,381 --> 00:05:17,951
Squarespace.

157
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:20,650
You could try it out before you enter
in your credit card information.

158
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:21,640
They let you try it.

159
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:24,940
They let you see what it's
like and then if you like it,

160
00:05:24,941 --> 00:05:25,420
if you say,

161
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:25,901
Ooh,

162
00:05:25,901 --> 00:05:26,390

163
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:26,981

we don't be shit.

165
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:29,770
Then you enter in your
credit card information.

166
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:33,430
They are that confident about the
product that they're providing.

167
00:05:33,431 --> 00:05:38,110
That's squarespace.com and
use the code word show.

168
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:42,850
We're also brought to you by [inaudible]
dot com that's o n n I t on it is a

169
00:05:42,851 --> 00:05:44,920
human optimization website.

170
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:50,040
We seek to inspire and give you the tools
to get your shit together physically,

171
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:53,230
whether it's with strength
and conditioning equipment,

172
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:58,220
whether it's with healthy foods and
snacks like hemp force protein bars,

173
00:05:58,221 --> 00:06:01,880
which are delicious and
guilt free protein bars.

174
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,070
They're fantastic for you,

175
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:09,220
very high in protein and very easy to
digest and they will not give you gas

176
00:06:09,321 --> 00:06:12,770
unless you're one of those fucking Weirdos
that just gets gas from everything.

177
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,030
And if that's the case,

178
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:14,871
hey fucker,

179
00:06:14,871 --> 00:06:15,704
it's not our fault,

180
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:18,650
but if you're not that guy or gal,

181
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:21,290
hem forest protein bars are
the shit you'll love him.

182
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,870
I also love the hemp force protein powder.

183
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:24,470
A,

184
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:27,530
we buy the finest protein
powder from Canada,

185
00:06:27,531 --> 00:06:30,290
the highest in protein and
the finest meaning like,

186
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,280
I don't mean just fine,

187
00:06:31,281 --> 00:06:32,270
like it's the most awesome,

188
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:34,570
but it's actually a finer blend of,

189
00:06:34,571 --> 00:06:35,251
of protein.

190
00:06:35,251 --> 00:06:36,980
So it's much easier to digest.

191
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,110
Um,

192
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:38,420
it's,

193
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:40,100
it's more expensive to do it that way,

194
00:06:40,101 --> 00:06:43,760
but what we're trying to do it on it is
just provide the very best things that

195
00:06:43,761 --> 00:06:44,570
we can find,

196
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:47,630
whether it's the very
best organic coconut oil,

197
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,550
the very best Himalayan salt,

198
00:06:49,551 --> 00:06:50,810
like whatever we can find.

199
00:06:50,811 --> 00:06:53,330
We try to find the highest
quality stuff and sell you that.

200
00:06:53,331 --> 00:06:55,460
Another new thing that
we have is warrior bars.

201
00:06:55,700 --> 00:07:00,700
What warrior bars are these new organic
buffalo bars with buffalo meat and no

202
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:02,480
added hormones.

203
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,560
No antibiotics,

204
00:07:03,561 --> 00:07:06,680
completely nitrate free
and really delicious.

205
00:07:06,681 --> 00:07:10,260
It's made the original native
American recipe with um,

206
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:10,630
they,

207
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:12,800
they cure them with or secure them,

208
00:07:12,801 --> 00:07:14,290
preserve them with cranberries.

209
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:14,900
Actually.

210
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:15,320
Um,

211
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,150
each bar is 140 calories,

212
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:21,020
four grams of fat and 14 grams of protein.

213
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:22,220
Super healthy for you,

214
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:23,061
no MSG,

215
00:07:23,061 --> 00:07:23,631
no soy,

216
00:07:23,631 --> 00:07:24,464
no lactose,

217
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:25,610
gluten free,

218
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:27,890
no antibiotics or added hormones,

219
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:30,770
a real true guilt free snack.

220
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:31,520

221

232
00:07:53,151 --> 00:07:55,340

233
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:56,810

237
00:07:57,561 --> 00:07:58,070
t.

238
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:59,570
And if you use the Codeword Rogan,

239
00:07:59,571 --> 00:08:01,880
you will save 10% off the supplements.

240
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:02,991
That's O,

241
00:08:02,991 --> 00:08:03,350
n,

242
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:03,710
N,

243
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:04,371
I t.

244
00:08:04,371 --> 00:08:05,870
And the code word is Rogan.

245
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,460
Eliza slessinger is here.

246
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,830
Why fuck around young Jamie.

247
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,180
Cue The music lab

248
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:14,563
experience.

249
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:23,510
I have friends that I see
every now and again like,

250
00:08:23,511 --> 00:08:23,841
dude,

251
00:08:23,841 --> 00:08:25,220
we gotta fucking podcast again,

252
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,210
but no,

253
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:31,210
no more where we've fucking miss the
mark and just lost the thread and send a

254
00:08:32,451 --> 00:08:35,180
few emails back and forth and then
dropped it and picked it up again.

255
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:37,550
Then you Elijah slessinger but we made it.

256
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:38,443
We made it happen.

257
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:39,733
You're here.

258
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:40,610
Uh,

259
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:41,480
what do you want to look at yourself?

260
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:42,920
You don't have to look at yourself.

261
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:44,090
You can shut them off.

262
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,760
Can to shut them off
because it will still be on.

263
00:08:46,761 --> 00:08:47,500
Are you freaking out?

264
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:47,600
No,

265
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,320
I'm fine.

266
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,220
You okay with the way you look?

267
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,660
You have been on TV.

268
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:52,520
Didn't you win a last comic standing?

269
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:52,971
Yeah,

270
00:08:52,971 --> 00:08:53,711
let's open with that.

271
00:08:53,711 --> 00:08:55,100
It's just everyone knows
who they're fucking with.

272
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,093
Yeah.

273
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:57,120
People notch out.

274
00:08:57,121 --> 00:08:57,954
Damn Bitch.

275
00:08:58,470 --> 00:08:58,860
Who took,

276
00:08:58,860 --> 00:08:59,850
who was on your season?

277
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:00,121
No.

278
00:09:00,121 --> 00:09:00,954
One of note.

279
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,800
That is the truth.

280
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,510
Last comic standing just told her,

281
00:09:06,511 --> 00:09:09,240
I'm like the ultimate fighter in a way
where like you get to a certain point in

282
00:09:09,241 --> 00:09:10,920
time where you're going
to run out of talent,

283
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:11,731
right.

284
00:09:11,731 --> 00:09:15,960
If you just keep going like you can't
come up with 20 great new comedians every

285
00:09:15,961 --> 00:09:16,794
year.

286
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,870
They didn't owe.

287
00:09:18,871 --> 00:09:19,704
They can believe it.

288
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:20,760
I was coming back.

289
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:23,900
Hopefully they'll focus more on standup.

290
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,000
Who saw the host of your,

291
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:25,800
was it Jay Moore?

292
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,190
The host Bill Bellamy.

293
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:27,480
Oh,

294
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,313
Bill Bellamy.

295
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,130
Sweetheart,

296
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:29,550
sweetheart.

297
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:30,383
I never met that dude.

298
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,390
Um,

299
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:32,910
cannot say my last name
but he's a sweetheart.

300
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,740
Slessinger is tough for black people.

301
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:35,970
Is tough for white people.

302
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,050
Is this lesson Gersh last thinker.

303
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:38,730
Schlesinger.

304
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:40,290
So I've been saying it
wrong every time I met you.

305
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:42,151
You don't want to,

306
00:09:42,151 --> 00:09:43,260
I just saw some girl.

307
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:45,510
It's almost as annoying as
having a hyphenated last name.

308
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:46,741
Yeah,

309
00:09:46,741 --> 00:09:47,574
that's gross.

310
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,110
Samuelson Jacobson.

311
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:49,681
Thank you.

312
00:09:49,681 --> 00:09:50,760
It's like nobody cares.

313
00:09:50,761 --> 00:09:52,080
Those people were pathetic.

314
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:55,680
Those dudes who changed their name for
the girl and then they make their name a

315
00:09:55,681 --> 00:09:56,550
hyphenated name.

316
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:57,720
You stop.

317
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:01,710
It's usually like a really horrible
like English professor or like women's

318
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:02,693
literature,

319
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:04,320
like teacher from the northeast.

320
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:05,640
It's like I have to keep my,

321
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:08,940
maintain my last name is just
like come on Alpha woman.

322
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:12,150
But he won two out but
he has to pay for it.

323
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:16,620
Well that's Super Alpha
Alpha and you know,

324
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,990
just being on top of them as well.

325
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:20,881
Let's call it what it,

326
00:10:20,881 --> 00:10:22,530
is that what it is a
lesbian than likes Dick?

327
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,110
I uh,

328
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:24,970
well I,

329
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:25,803
I think,

330
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:26,620
yeah.

331
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:27,060
Can you,

332
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:29,940
can you be an Alpha female and just be,

333
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,833
uh,

334
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,640
just a woman who's heterosexual,

335
00:10:32,641 --> 00:10:33,840
but she just likes to be the boss.

336
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:35,850
So possible if course,

337
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:37,110
again,

338
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:39,510
of course everybody has
their breaking point.

339
00:10:39,511 --> 00:10:41,850
If you've been paying attention
to this ban bossy campaign,

340
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,050
they've been paying attention to that.

341
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:43,321
You know,

342
00:10:43,321 --> 00:10:44,154
I just got in town.

343
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:46,933
That's my answer.

344
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:48,720
Uh,

345
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,910
some feminists are trying
to ban the word boss,

346
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:51,500
Dan.

347
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,430
I thought it was like band
was one guy in Boston,

348
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,333
another and they were like,

349
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:56,013
okay.

350
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:59,220
I was trying to sound like
real like for council member.

351
00:10:59,250 --> 00:10:59,490
Yeah.

352
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:01,410
They're trying to ban the term bossy.

353
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,333
Yeah.

354
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:02,911
They think that,

355
00:11:02,911 --> 00:11:03,120
well,

356
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:03,820
that word,

357
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:04,720
but there's nothing wrong with,

358
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:06,630
I'm super bossy and so is blank.

359
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:06,870
Well,

360
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:08,610
I think bossy is blanches her dog.

361
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,490
I think bossy is kind of a silly word.

362
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:11,821
Like,

363
00:11:11,821 --> 00:11:11,911
well,

364
00:11:11,911 --> 00:11:12,900
you beat all Bossy,

365
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,793
you know,

366
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:15,180
it's not like would he be a cunt?

367
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,710
You know what I'm saying?

368
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:16,981
No,

369
00:11:16,981 --> 00:11:17,091
I,

370
00:11:17,091 --> 00:11:18,060
if somebody's in a meeting,

371
00:11:18,061 --> 00:11:18,320
we're like,

372
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:18,591
Eliza,

373
00:11:18,591 --> 00:11:19,360
you're being bossy.

374
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:19,860
I,

375
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:22,080
it'd be funny if you said
that in a corporate setting.

376
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,350
I think we have a real problem with,

377
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:25,890
uh,

378
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:26,760
the sexes,

379
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:28,680
with the battle between
the men and the women.

380
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:33,060
And one of the big problems is that a
lot of people are just shitheads and it's

381
00:11:33,061 --> 00:11:36,090
just like making concessions
to deal with shitheads,

382
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,680
whether it's male or female.

383
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:39,930
I think that's across the
board for not even for me,

384
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:40,890
it's for race,

385
00:11:40,891 --> 00:11:42,090
for socioeconomic things,

386
00:11:42,091 --> 00:11:42,470
for everything.

387
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:43,470
It's just concession.

388
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:44,490
I think you're totally right.

389
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:47,010
I think that it's just dealing
with a lot of shitheads,

390
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:51,060
but then there's like things that
just throw you so out of whack,

391
00:11:51,061 --> 00:11:52,260
like ban Bossy,

392
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:52,960
like,

393
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,081
well,

394
00:11:53,081 --> 00:11:53,651
you gotta go,

395
00:11:53,651 --> 00:11:54,760
come on.

396
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,980
You being so you guys are so crazy.

397
00:11:56,981 --> 00:11:58,690
You were making the whole thing a parody.

398
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:02,860
It takes away the legitimacy from anything
else that you have a problem with.

399
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:03,790
I can understand if bitch,

400
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:04,653
I hate that word.

401
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:06,610
And that my biggest defense,

402
00:12:06,611 --> 00:12:08,080
if I ever get into a real argument,

403
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:09,280
if you ladies,

404
00:12:09,281 --> 00:12:11,260
for the three of you listening a while,

405
00:12:11,261 --> 00:12:14,250
you're at Jiu Jitsu black belt.

406
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:17,200
If you call a guy bitchy
before he can call you bitchy,

407
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:20,050
you win there because there's
no coming back from that.

408
00:12:20,051 --> 00:12:22,270
Once you've like emasculated
someone and you've been like,

409
00:12:22,271 --> 00:12:23,140
you're being a bitch,

410
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:23,561
then they're like,

411
00:12:23,561 --> 00:12:24,160
Whoa,

412
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:24,910
I got news for you.

413
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:28,450
If you can say you're being a bitch
to a guy in your emasculating him,

414
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,370
he was lost from the start.

415
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,290
If a girl calls me a bitch,

416
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:32,680
I'm like,

417
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:32,981
oh,

418
00:12:32,981 --> 00:12:33,251
okay.

419
00:12:33,251 --> 00:12:34,084
Really?

420
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:35,050
What else?

421
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:37,540
Obviously it will stop me
dead hanging out with her.

422
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:38,733
That's fair enough.

423
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:39,573
What are we doing?

424
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,080
But if you're having an argument,

425
00:12:41,081 --> 00:12:41,990
like if for whatever,

426
00:12:41,991 --> 00:12:44,590
I think if you were in the audience and
you told someone quit being a bitch,

427
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:47,770
but am I pointing for their platform?

428
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:48,221
If they had said,

429
00:12:48,221 --> 00:12:52,360
stop using the word bitchy or let's stop
using other derogatory female words,

430
00:12:52,361 --> 00:12:52,661
that's fine,

431
00:12:52,661 --> 00:12:56,080
but bossy makes them sound like a bunch
of fourth graders that want to run for

432
00:12:56,081 --> 00:12:56,800
class president.

433
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:56,981
Well,

434
00:12:56,981 --> 00:13:01,540
it sounds like what they're trying to
do is just take away any even mildly

435
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:06,541
derogatory or mildly negative terms that
could be applied to women that aren't

436
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:09,820
going to be applied to men
because bossy doesn't seem,

437
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,670
it doesn't seem like you would
use that in a master once.

438
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:12,371
I was going to say that.

439
00:13:12,371 --> 00:13:12,760
Yeah.

440
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:13,511
It's totally not,

441
00:13:13,511 --> 00:13:14,500
it's just for girls,

442
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,540
but it's also for little girls.

443
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,790
Like I would never
describe a woman as bossy.

444
00:13:18,791 --> 00:13:19,030
I'd say.

445
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:20,770
I'd probably just say she
was bitchy to be quite frank.

446
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:21,311
But yeah,

447
00:13:21,311 --> 00:13:23,500
it's not for guys because
men are already bossy.

448
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:26,440
So I guess there in lies the problem.

449
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:26,670
Yeah.

450
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:28,540
If you had like a woman who was a boss,

451
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,920
like if she was the boss,

452
00:13:29,921 --> 00:13:30,760
like a strong black woman,

453
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:31,990
a strong black woman,

454
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,011
and you're like,

455
00:13:33,011 --> 00:13:33,311
well,

456
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:33,940
uh,

457
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:35,350
how was Shinya?

458
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:36,340
Is she a good boss?

459
00:13:36,341 --> 00:13:37,000
And you'd be like,

460
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:37,930
she's a good boss,

461
00:13:37,931 --> 00:13:40,010
but a tad Bossar right.

462
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:40,920
It's two totally different things.

463
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:41,763
That's how the ball,

464
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:42,751
it's a tad ball.

465
00:13:42,751 --> 00:13:43,900
Say she's a dominant woman,

466
00:13:43,901 --> 00:13:45,820
but a Tom Bossert smells her shit.

467
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:48,030
She's good at her job per Todd bullshit.

468
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,060
When I think Bossy,

469
00:13:49,061 --> 00:13:50,260
I think micromanage.

470
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:54,010
I think of my mom at like Thanksgiving
who like she brings an excel spreadsheet

471
00:13:54,011 --> 00:13:55,060
to plan out thanksgiving.

472
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:55,720
No,

473
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,680
and some people does.

474
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:57,783
That's where you get it from.

475
00:13:57,850 --> 00:13:58,990
I'm not that organized.

476
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:01,150
I go the other way.

477
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:06,130
I in the quietest way when I visit
my family because my mom's like go,

478
00:14:06,131 --> 00:14:06,281
go,

479
00:14:06,281 --> 00:14:06,431
go.

480
00:14:06,431 --> 00:14:07,264
Here's what we're doing.

481
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:09,340
She'll ask me months in
advance about plane tickets.

482
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:10,540
I shut down.

483
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:14,520
I turned into like the biggest
stoner attitude without partners.

484
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,460
Like I dunno man,

485
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:18,970
whatever happens cause she's
so bossy that you can't,

486
00:14:18,971 --> 00:14:21,370
you have no option but to go the
other way or you will explode.

487
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,200
Isn't that funny how you see kids?

488
00:14:23,201 --> 00:14:27,100
That there's a direct result of rebelling
against their parents that's shaped

489
00:14:27,101 --> 00:14:27,934
her personality?

490
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:29,680
Lot of kids like that?

491
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:30,630
Yeah.

492
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:31,070
Whether,

493
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:31,811
whether you mean to or not.

494
00:14:31,811 --> 00:14:33,760
I mean I think my mom's great but I just,

495
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,430
I think also like energy wise,

496
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:39,370
like if you're an Alpha but you
meet someone that's a super alpha,

497
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:41,050
like you can only have one super alpha.

498
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:42,580
Like I've met girls that are like,

499
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:42,820
I'm,

500
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:45,220
I'm kind of Bossy and
I'm very like in control,

501
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:46,720
but when I meet other girls that are like,

502
00:14:46,721 --> 00:14:48,100
that's all their personality,

503
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,390
I just get very quiet.

504
00:14:49,391 --> 00:14:49,631
I'm like,

505
00:14:49,631 --> 00:14:52,220
I'll just do whatever you want
when you don't rip my tits

506
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:53,053
off.

507
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:55,730
Does that annoy you though?

508
00:14:55,731 --> 00:14:58,700
Doesn't it annoy you when someone's
Super Alpha or Super Bossy?

509
00:14:59,160 --> 00:14:59,790
If I don't,

510
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:00,740
if I don't mind what we're doing.

511
00:15:00,741 --> 00:15:04,190
Like I went to a wedding and there was
this girl who was just like running shit

512
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:07,160
and she was telling everyone to do and
I've been like one wedding ever so I was

513
00:15:07,161 --> 00:15:09,980
fine to just do whatever she
said because it's not my domain.

514
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:13,730
If it were something where I felt that
I should be in charge than it would be

515
00:15:13,731 --> 00:15:14,360
different.

516
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:17,480
Was this girl that bridesmaid
or the sister of the bride or,

517
00:15:17,481 --> 00:15:19,250
I think she was just
one of the bridesmaids.

518
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:20,450
She was just a good run.

519
00:15:20,451 --> 00:15:24,800
But I think part of being a comic also
are being a human is identifying what

520
00:15:24,801 --> 00:15:28,760
someone is and fully respecting that and
rather than go against them sometimes

521
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:29,391
you know,

522
00:15:29,391 --> 00:15:30,800
then you find out why they're like that.

523
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,090
She was dealing with some personal things.

524
00:15:32,091 --> 00:15:34,930
So I was glad that I went with
it versus butted up buddy.

525
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:37,220
I'm against her because it would've just,

526
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:38,570
it would've been a fight for no reason.

527
00:15:38,571 --> 00:15:39,404
Does that make sense?

528
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:42,230
So fight for no reason is a good way
to put it because that's what a lot of

529
00:15:42,231 --> 00:15:43,011
people engage in.

530
00:15:43,011 --> 00:15:43,940
They engage in these fights.

531
00:15:43,941 --> 00:15:46,670
Like I've had conversations with
friends where they'll tell me,

532
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,830
oh this fucking God said
this and I was like,

533
00:15:48,831 --> 00:15:49,664
fuck you.

534
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:50,930
And I fucking told him like,

535
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:53,160
I know what you're doing is passive
aggressive bullshit is not going away.

536
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:54,740
And like at the end of the day,

537
00:15:54,741 --> 00:15:54,981
man,

538
00:15:54,981 --> 00:15:55,820
what do you care?

539
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:57,130
What do you mean it's not going to change?

540
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:58,431
It's funny,

541
00:15:58,431 --> 00:15:59,930
he said nothing was accomplished,

542
00:15:59,931 --> 00:16:00,710
nothing was accomplished.

543
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:01,101
They're not.

544
00:16:01,101 --> 00:16:01,970
Especially as an adult,

545
00:16:01,971 --> 00:16:02,631
like no one's gonna be like,

546
00:16:02,631 --> 00:16:04,320
you really made me review my behavior.

547
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:05,883
She can,

548
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,210
but most of the times you
can without going fuck you.

549
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,790
Most of the times you can by
just talking to them and say,

550
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:11,241
hey man,

551
00:16:11,241 --> 00:16:11,481
you know,

552
00:16:11,481 --> 00:16:12,261
I respect too,

553
00:16:12,261 --> 00:16:14,990
but this is how you're coming off to me.

554
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:15,760
I,

555
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:19,280
I had a thing recently was someone and
I sent them an email and the best thing

556
00:16:19,281 --> 00:16:20,114
to do is start out with,

557
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,530
if I've done something to offend you,

558
00:16:21,531 --> 00:16:22,364
please let me know.

559
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:24,950
You start out like showing them
your pink soft under belly.

560
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:27,710
And then that gives
them a space to be like,

561
00:16:27,711 --> 00:16:28,280
oh my God,

562
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,091
I'm so sorry.

563
00:16:29,091 --> 00:16:29,871
I didn't mean to do it.

564
00:16:29,871 --> 00:16:31,910
Like if you come from
a place of contrition,

565
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:32,540
uh,

566
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:34,220
versus around playing yesterday,

567
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:35,810
you know when you get on
a plane and you're like,

568
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:36,350
oops,

569
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:38,300
I didn't realize how drunk
I was until I landed.

570
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:41,430
Like you'd get on the plane drunk from
the night before where you really helped

571
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:43,940
getting her party on it.

572
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,500
They're on the road was
one of those nights.

573
00:16:45,501 --> 00:16:46,970
It's just like escalated very quickly.

574
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:47,833
What happened?

575
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,870
I just went out in Tampa with just some
friends and I don't know why we were

576
00:16:50,871 --> 00:16:51,770
drinking so much.

577
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,000
I don't know what happened.

578
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:54,253
Um,

579
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:55,670
but I had the one crazy,

580
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:56,743
it got crazy.

581
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:57,733
I just got really drunk.

582
00:16:57,830 --> 00:16:58,663
Like I'm a plane.

583
00:16:58,890 --> 00:16:59,150
I mean,

584
00:16:59,150 --> 00:16:59,450
okay,

585
00:16:59,450 --> 00:16:59,751
I'm sorry.

586
00:16:59,751 --> 00:17:00,650
This is really bothered me.

587
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:04,160
And I'm in the fact that I was in first
class is not the point of the story,

588
00:17:04,161 --> 00:17:08,000
but I was in boarding group one and
they bought it all the like one came

589
00:17:08,001 --> 00:17:08,331
members,

590
00:17:08,331 --> 00:17:09,310
global services is there,

591
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:09,451
like,

592
00:17:09,451 --> 00:17:09,920
can I want,

593
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,280
so I let this woman go past me.

594
00:17:11,281 --> 00:17:11,451
I go,

595
00:17:11,451 --> 00:17:11,811
go ahead.

596
00:17:11,811 --> 00:17:13,070
I'm not global service.

597
00:17:13,071 --> 00:17:14,060
I'm not in any elite group.

598
00:17:14,061 --> 00:17:14,841
I'm just in first class.

599
00:17:14,841 --> 00:17:15,674
And she goes,

600
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:15,951
Oh,

601
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:17,210
well I'm going to first class too.

602
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:18,080
There's only 12 of us.

603
00:17:18,081 --> 00:17:18,470
She was like,

604
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:19,310
just go ahead of me.

605
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:19,941
I go,

606
00:17:19,941 --> 00:17:20,510
okay.

607
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:23,240
And this guy from behind me goes,

608
00:17:23,241 --> 00:17:23,690
yeah,

609
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:25,040
don't worry about anyone else.

610
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:27,110
Just fucking do whatever you want to do.

611
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:28,610
And I thought he was joking,

612
00:17:28,611 --> 00:17:31,700
like he was so angry and
I was so buzz that like,

613
00:17:31,701 --> 00:17:32,391
it wasn't sure,

614
00:17:32,391 --> 00:17:32,750
like,

615
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:33,650
am I seeing things?

616
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:34,641
So I get on the plane,

617
00:17:34,641 --> 00:17:38,210
I sit down and this guy made a point
to when he walked on the plane to be

618
00:17:38,211 --> 00:17:42,980
shaking his head at me when he got on
the plane and every time I looked over to

619
00:17:42,981 --> 00:17:44,120
like make sure he was real,

620
00:17:44,121 --> 00:17:48,920
he would be shaking his head like I had
done something and being a comic I then

621
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:54,170
the next three hours crafting the perfect
comeback for when we got up cause I

622
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:58,590
was sure we were going to butt heads
and like it was going to go down and the

623
00:17:58,591 --> 00:18:01,920
plane landed and he got up and he walked
off and I never got a chance to say

624
00:18:01,921 --> 00:18:02,710
anything to him.

625
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:04,870
That's something not
to get worked up about.

626
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:07,810
That's a weird one to get worked up
about like letting someone go in front of

627
00:18:07,811 --> 00:18:07,961
you,

628
00:18:07,961 --> 00:18:09,540
being polite and [inaudible].

629
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:10,390
Although people,

630
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:12,430
I don't know why I think there's
like a dark cloud over my head.

631
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:14,320
Like I just attract like negative energy.

632
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:15,183
I don't think so.

633
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:16,023
I've never seen it.

634
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:17,890
If there was a dark cloud over your head,

635
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:18,940
I think I want to notice that.

636
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,740
I think people just
randomly like who gets,

637
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:21,290
I don't know,

638
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:21,840
maybe I just,

639
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:22,211
you,

640
00:18:22,211 --> 00:18:22,750
um,

641
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:25,270
you're very strong personality
and I mean that in a good way.

642
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:29,050
That's why you and I are such good
friends because we're both strong

643
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:30,730
personalities because you,

644
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:32,080
you always say that about me,

645
00:18:32,081 --> 00:18:33,190
but you're not like,

646
00:18:33,191 --> 00:18:34,630
but like you're super cool about it.

647
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:35,260
Well,

648
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:36,093
I'm not,

649
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:37,360
I'm not offended by it.

650
00:18:37,361 --> 00:18:39,310
I think some people are intimidated by,

651
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:43,210
well there's men that are certainly
intimidated by women who were smart and

652
00:18:43,211 --> 00:18:44,920
quick and have a strong personality.

653
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:46,293
Yeah.

654
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:47,530
Well I've sent it to you before.

655
00:18:47,531 --> 00:18:47,681
Like,

656
00:18:47,681 --> 00:18:49,000
I dunno what you do when you date.

657
00:18:49,001 --> 00:18:50,950
Like it's gotta be rough out
there for a chick like you.

658
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:51,760
I don't know either.

659
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,600
You got a lot,

660
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:53,381
a lot of,

661
00:18:53,381 --> 00:18:54,010
um,

662
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:55,210
unusual attributes.

663
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:57,580
You're very smart and
you're also very quick.

664
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,020
Like when I talk to you sometimes,

665
00:18:59,021 --> 00:19:02,170
like I don't think I talk as
quick as you most of the time.

666
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:03,093
And you're always like,

667
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:04,873
and I was like,

668
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,190
I felt like a Gremlin eating.

669
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:06,641
Yeah.

670
00:19:06,641 --> 00:19:07,600
So it's like when,

671
00:19:07,601 --> 00:19:09,070
when we have conversations with like,

672
00:19:09,071 --> 00:19:09,341
Whoa,

673
00:19:09,341 --> 00:19:10,780
I've got to pick up the pace here alive,

674
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,083
throwing heat.

675
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:12,391
You know,

676
00:19:12,391 --> 00:19:14,140
like you're so excited to talk to you.

677
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:14,311
Well,

678
00:19:14,311 --> 00:19:14,891
you were always,

679
00:19:14,891 --> 00:19:15,161
you know,

680
00:19:15,161 --> 00:19:15,821
you're fired up.

681
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:16,750
You're fired up person.

682
00:19:16,751 --> 00:19:18,130
So fired up that.

683
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:21,190
But I think some men don't want that.

684
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:23,170
They want to check to just lay back.

685
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:24,040
Fair enough.

686
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:24,790
But take it.

687
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:25,640
What do you think that is?

688
00:19:25,641 --> 00:19:27,880
Do you think that men are
scared of competition?

689
00:19:27,881 --> 00:19:30,670
Do you think that they're not secure in
themselves so they don't like someone

690
00:19:30,671 --> 00:19:32,680
who they might judge
themselves against and go,

691
00:19:32,681 --> 00:19:33,071
you know what?

692
00:19:33,071 --> 00:19:36,670
I think my fucking girlfriends faster
than me and she's smarter than me.

693
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:37,211
I think there's,

694
00:19:37,211 --> 00:19:38,770
I think that's for guys or girls,

695
00:19:38,771 --> 00:19:40,120
like nobody wants to feel threatened.

696
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:43,280
But I also think there's just different
types of guys and there's secure guys

697
00:19:43,281 --> 00:19:46,330
and there's insecure guys
and some people also don't,

698
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:46,530
well,

699
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:49,420
I think everyone's a little
insecure just as a human being mean.

700
00:19:49,421 --> 00:19:50,560
The fact that we're vulnerable,

701
00:19:50,561 --> 00:19:51,191
we're going to die.

702
00:19:51,191 --> 00:19:51,881
We get diseases,

703
00:19:51,881 --> 00:19:53,310
we get hit in the head by asteroids.

704
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:54,071
Shit happens.

705
00:19:54,071 --> 00:19:54,251
You know?

706
00:19:54,251 --> 00:19:55,084
Everyone's a little,

707
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:56,830
little bit insecure.

708
00:19:56,890 --> 00:19:57,250
Sure.

709
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:58,570
But there's,

710
00:19:58,571 --> 00:19:59,980
there's levels of that shit.

711
00:19:59,981 --> 00:20:01,750
And I think that a girl who's just,

712
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,040
you don't look,

713
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:04,023
you have your dog,

714
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:05,320
you don't need anybody for love.

715
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,460
If you have a great career,

716
00:20:06,461 --> 00:20:07,780
you don't need anybody for money,

717
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:08,381
you know,

718
00:20:08,381 --> 00:20:08,891
you're pretty,

719
00:20:08,891 --> 00:20:09,910
you can meet other guys.

720
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:12,970
It's like you got a lot of things that
would fuck with a dude's head and you're

721
00:20:12,971 --> 00:20:13,870
smart and fast.

722
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:16,720
That's gotta be tricky.

723
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,033
That'd be tricky.

724
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:18,873
I've,

725
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,090
I don't know.

726
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:20,990
And the older I get,

727
00:20:20,991 --> 00:20:21,730
the more like I,

728
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:23,510
I think when you're in
your 20s and you date,

729
00:20:23,511 --> 00:20:24,301
you don't really think about it.

730
00:20:24,301 --> 00:20:27,350
And now that I'm 31 I'm kind of
looking back in hindsight and I'm like,

731
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:27,531
yeah,

732
00:20:27,531 --> 00:20:29,240
maybe they did have an issue.

733
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:31,400
Like what starts off
as not being an issue.

734
00:20:31,401 --> 00:20:33,170
I think in the end
becomes an issue for them.

735
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:34,400
But I don't,

736
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,810
any guy that I date is like
very supportive because I
don't date comics either.

737
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:42,200
So they're very supportive and they
really respect what I do and I in turn

738
00:20:42,201 --> 00:20:43,100
respect what they do.

739
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:43,431
You know,

740
00:20:43,431 --> 00:20:45,350
you really have to respect
what somebody else does.

741
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:45,561
I mean,

742
00:20:45,561 --> 00:20:46,040
if you,

743
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,920
I could never date a that's sucked.

744
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:49,870
Even if he was a great person.

745
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:53,020
Because if you have a job
and you are bad at your job,

746
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,420
like you actively bad at your job,

747
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:57,370
then it means that you're delusional.

748
00:20:57,650 --> 00:20:57,850
Right?

749
00:20:57,850 --> 00:20:58,930
That means you're crazy.

750
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:00,600
And it's like if you don't like my stand,

751
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,031
that's one thing.

752
00:21:01,031 --> 00:21:03,640
But there are plenty of people
that do versus I'm a musician,

753
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,200
I had can't get a record deal.

754
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:07,800
My is always out of tune
and like this is my passion.

755
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:08,051
I'd be like,

756
00:21:08,051 --> 00:21:08,231
okay,

757
00:21:08,231 --> 00:21:09,490
well then you take your passion,

758
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,350
you can go to the third tree,

759
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:12,100
prominent author because I keys.

760
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:16,630
That means there are other areas in your
life where that where you being that

761
00:21:16,631 --> 00:21:19,750
inept is gonna is gonna
do is going to harm you.

762
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:20,681
I agree.

763
00:21:20,681 --> 00:21:24,190
And I think that people that are really
bad at something and don't realize that

764
00:21:24,191 --> 00:21:26,560
they're really bad at
something that's a sign of,

765
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:27,010
there's a,

766
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:27,843
there's like a,

767
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,020
there's something wrong.

768
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,670
It's like a pathology there,

769
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:31,510
I think.

770
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:33,430
But I also think they're
lucky in a weird way,

771
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:35,140
like ignorance is bliss.

772
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,490
Like they're just super hot.

773
00:21:36,491 --> 00:21:37,510
Like people are so happy.

774
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:38,560
I don't buy that shit.

775
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:39,970
I don't buy it at all.

776
00:21:39,971 --> 00:21:40,360
They're not.

777
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:40,720
They're not.

778
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:41,050
It's not.

779
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:41,771
There's no bliss.

780
00:21:41,771 --> 00:21:42,700
There's failure.

781
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:44,350
They're nothing but failure.

782
00:21:44,351 --> 00:21:45,490
They can never get it together.

783
00:21:45,491 --> 00:21:47,410
I think that's just the
opposite of being lucky.

784
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:50,920
Think people are happy or think they're
really good when they're not good.

785
00:21:50,921 --> 00:21:54,010
I think that was probably one of the worst
things that could ever befall a human

786
00:21:54,011 --> 00:21:56,300
being because you think they
secretly know they might.

787
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:57,310
I don't think they do know.

788
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:58,210
Even if they don't know.

789
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,730
I have a conversation with comics.

790
00:21:59,731 --> 00:22:02,440
I think they're good and
I know they fucking suck.

791
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:06,220
I know they suck and they think they're
good and you'll talk to them about sets

792
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,770
and they bombed and they'll
tell you that it went great.

793
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,450
What are you about that?

794
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,600
Because I've had that happen
where a lot to like a friend.

795
00:22:13,601 --> 00:22:13,870
Yeah.

796
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:14,750
Or he'll be like,

797
00:22:14,751 --> 00:22:15,610
I crushed it.

798
00:22:15,611 --> 00:22:16,480
And then someone else would be like,

799
00:22:16,481 --> 00:22:16,601
yeah,

800
00:22:16,601 --> 00:22:16,871
I saw.

801
00:22:16,871 --> 00:22:17,680
I said it was,

802
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,311
it was terrible.

803
00:22:18,311 --> 00:22:18,910
So then you're,

804
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:19,743
you're faced with,

805
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:20,411
you're like,

806
00:22:20,411 --> 00:22:21,550
who's the crazy person here?

807
00:22:21,551 --> 00:22:24,520
Are you lying to me or are you delusional?

808
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:25,870
Are you,

809
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:30,040
do you know that you suck but you deep
down or do you really deep down think

810
00:22:30,041 --> 00:22:33,040
you're really good but you had to be like
what's going on and why am I the only

811
00:22:33,041 --> 00:22:33,580
one seeing it?

812
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:35,470
You see it's just like we
were talking about before,

813
00:22:35,471 --> 00:22:39,370
that type of personality can manifest
itself in a bunch of different ways and

814
00:22:39,371 --> 00:22:41,070
this is just one example of it there.

815
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:43,660
It'll show up in a bunch of
different parts of their life.

816
00:22:43,661 --> 00:22:44,740
It's not just that,

817
00:22:44,741 --> 00:22:47,200
but a lot of it is revisionist history.

818
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:51,700
They'll Dell have a bad set and then
go back over their head and find things

819
00:22:51,701 --> 00:22:55,060
about the set that were good and then
convince themselves that it was good.

820
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,660
See I wish I had that ability
cause I'll have a good set.

821
00:22:57,670 --> 00:22:58,503
So here's why.

822
00:22:58,630 --> 00:23:01,560
Because all have a good set and I'll go
back and I'll find all the bad things.

823
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:01,871
I'll be like,

824
00:23:01,871 --> 00:23:03,100
that was horrible.

825
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:04,450
That's because you're an artist,

826
00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:06,130
an artist.

827
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:08,600
That's what's called someone who is care.

828
00:23:08,601 --> 00:23:10,480
So wouldn't it be nice to give
yourself a break once in a while?

829
00:23:10,481 --> 00:23:11,050
No,

830
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:11,281
no.

831
00:23:11,281 --> 00:23:12,160
It's like you get better.

832
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:13,150
I completely agree.

833
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:15,700
I don't know why I'm playing this
like passive passive hippie role.

834
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,720
I just deal with it.

835
00:23:16,721 --> 00:23:17,040
I,

836
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:17,651
I look,

837
00:23:17,651 --> 00:23:18,490
I can crush,

838
00:23:18,491 --> 00:23:21,700
I can have a standing ovation and I'll
fuck up one joke and then she will haunt

839
00:23:21,701 --> 00:23:25,930
me for days for Denver and every comic
knows like the one guy in the front row

840
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:27,130
who's mentally damaged.

841
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:27,851
That can't laugh,

842
00:23:27,851 --> 00:23:29,890
but it's sitting in the front row and
you don't know that they're retarded till

843
00:23:29,891 --> 00:23:30,431
later and you're like,

844
00:23:30,431 --> 00:23:31,570
he wasn't laughing.

845
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:31,781
Oh,

846
00:23:31,781 --> 00:23:32,890
I don't pay attention to that.

847
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:34,480
That I don't pay attention.

848
00:23:34,481 --> 00:23:35,171
If you don't laugh,

849
00:23:35,171 --> 00:23:36,004
that's on you.

850
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:39,010
You could choose not to laugh
at a lot of things in life,

851
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:40,083
but what I,

852
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:41,740
it's like at this stage in my life,

853
00:23:41,741 --> 00:23:45,010
I know when I'm out of tune and I've been
out of tune before and I fucking hate

854
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:47,390
that feeling and that
shit will drive me crazy.

855
00:23:47,391 --> 00:23:49,220
But I always feel like I
get better because of that.

856
00:23:49,221 --> 00:23:50,054
If I have a,

857
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:50,451
yeah,

858
00:23:50,451 --> 00:23:52,460
if I have a moment where I'm
out of tune and it haunts me,

859
00:23:52,461 --> 00:23:53,510
it makes me work harder.

860
00:23:53,511 --> 00:23:54,860
It makes me go back to the notebooks.

861
00:23:54,861 --> 00:23:55,840
It makes me go back to the,

862
00:23:55,930 --> 00:23:56,350
to the,

863
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:57,170
to the keyboard.

864
00:23:57,170 --> 00:23:58,850
That's the other thing for like comics,

865
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:00,350
if it was comics listening,

866
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:01,573
I always have,

867
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,230
cause I always come up
and they was asking you,

868
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:04,450
you know what?

869
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:05,750
What's the secret of what do you do?

870
00:24:05,751 --> 00:24:07,430
And I'm like you need
to stop talking to me.

871
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:08,540
And did you get on stage?

872
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:11,360
You need to stop writing and like
doing your act in the mirror.

873
00:24:11,361 --> 00:24:14,180
Like you need to get onstage
and fail and fail and fail.

874
00:24:14,181 --> 00:24:15,830
And when that joke
sucks 10 times in a row,

875
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,210
do it 10 more times in a row.

876
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:18,650
It's repetition.

877
00:24:18,651 --> 00:24:21,890
It's just like being an athlete
and people don't get that right.

878
00:24:21,891 --> 00:24:22,370
When this is what,

879
00:24:22,370 --> 00:24:23,510
just what we were talking about,

880
00:24:23,511 --> 00:24:25,100
the people that don't see it,

881
00:24:25,101 --> 00:24:25,850
the nurses,

882
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:26,511
bliss people,

883
00:24:26,511 --> 00:24:27,920
they're not going to get those lessons.

884
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:28,101
No,

885
00:24:28,101 --> 00:24:29,390
there'll be terrible for sure.

886
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:29,780
Forever.

887
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:30,613
I don't know why I said that.

888
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:34,250
What you just trying to alleviate a
little bit of the tension that find some

889
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:35,093
happiness.

890
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:35,750
Yeah,

891
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:36,583
I uh,

892
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:37,580
yeah,

893
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:38,413
but we can't,

894
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,850
there's comfort in discomfort.

895
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:42,980
You can learn from them.

896
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:44,150
That's the good place.

897
00:24:44,151 --> 00:24:45,470
I like being uncomfortable.

898
00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:47,900
I think some of the best moments
on stage or when you ignore,

899
00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:48,200
I mean,

900
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,870
and audiences love it when
something bombs and you're like,

901
00:24:50,871 --> 00:24:51,704
this is,

902
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:53,330
you guys deserved a
better ending than that.

903
00:24:53,331 --> 00:24:54,164
And I'm sorry,

904
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:56,990
I'm sorry I came at you with
that you paid taking home,

905
00:24:56,991 --> 00:24:58,940
you're free improv glasses
and I shouldn't have.

906
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:02,030
Well that's one of the best ways to
get through a new bit and you go like,

907
00:25:02,031 --> 00:25:03,410
that bit is not done.

908
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:05,211
It needs work.

909
00:25:05,211 --> 00:25:06,410
That's a trick that we all do.

910
00:25:06,411 --> 00:25:06,681
Yeah.

911
00:25:06,681 --> 00:25:09,770
Or I've said that the other day I
did a whole bit and it had this great

912
00:25:09,771 --> 00:25:11,030
crescendo and everything and there,

913
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:13,310
right where there should have
been like the killer punch line.

914
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:14,143
I was just like,

915
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:16,160
this bit needs were.

916
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:17,001
I was like,

917
00:25:17,001 --> 00:25:18,410
I'm sorry I took you on that journey,

918
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:19,460
but wasn't it fun?

919
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:23,390
Isn't it funny though that the only way
to really work on those bits besides the

920
00:25:23,391 --> 00:25:25,220
writing and the stuff
that you do by herself,

921
00:25:25,221 --> 00:25:28,130
as you got to do it in front of people
and tweak it in front of people,

922
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:28,671
guys,

923
00:25:28,671 --> 00:25:30,200
you got to get up and
you gotta just do it.

924
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:31,561
There is no right.

925
00:25:31,561 --> 00:25:32,720
I mean you can write all you want.

926
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:33,410
We'll are,

927
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:36,500
we have the one of the weirdest art forms
because it's one of the only art forms

928
00:25:36,501 --> 00:25:40,100
that comes to life and
develops in front of people.

929
00:25:40,101 --> 00:25:44,060
You could develop a killer fucking
song by yourself and you can say,

930
00:25:44,061 --> 00:25:44,241
Hey,

931
00:25:44,241 --> 00:25:45,390
I wrote this song and you play it.

932
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,233
It's done.

933
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:46,641
You know,

934
00:25:46,641 --> 00:25:47,420
you could play it for me.

935
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:47,781
And I'd be like,

936
00:25:47,781 --> 00:25:48,471
Holy Shit,

937
00:25:48,471 --> 00:25:49,700
that's a great fucking song.

938
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,860
But it's kind of rare.

939
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,150
It happens occasionally.

940
00:25:53,151 --> 00:25:56,390
There's some bits that just
write themselves and then
they're done right out of

941
00:25:56,391 --> 00:25:57,140
the gate.

942
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:57,500
But it's,

943
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:58,760
most of the time they,

944
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,690
they come alive in front of people and
then you edit them in front of people and

945
00:26:02,691 --> 00:26:03,500
you change them.

946
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:04,161
And then you know,

947
00:26:04,161 --> 00:26:05,270
you love those two show,

948
00:26:05,271 --> 00:26:06,780
Friday two shows Saturday week.

949
00:26:06,781 --> 00:26:07,550
So you're really good.

950
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:08,510
By the time the late show,

951
00:26:08,511 --> 00:26:09,440
Saturday rolls around,

952
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:11,090
you've got a good sense
of how that bit works.

953
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:12,410
And it's,

954
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:12,860
it's,

955
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:16,190
it's also because it's ever
evolving and it's a living thing.

956
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:17,001
And the bit,

957
00:26:17,001 --> 00:26:19,430
I mean you could have a bit
that you said like it's pretty,

958
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:20,691
I won't say perfect,

959
00:26:20,691 --> 00:26:21,920
but it is the way it is.

960
00:26:21,921 --> 00:26:25,340
You've been doing the same but it's ever
changing and you're always tweaking it.

961
00:26:25,341 --> 00:26:26,420
You're always fixing a little bit.

962
00:26:26,421 --> 00:26:27,560
It's never perfect,

963
00:26:27,561 --> 00:26:29,810
which is what makes it
frustrating but also so fun.

964
00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:30,261
Yeah.

965
00:26:30,261 --> 00:26:31,240
I'm glad you said that.

966
00:26:31,241 --> 00:26:32,780
Cause that's how I always describe it.

967
00:26:32,810 --> 00:26:35,240
I always describe comedy
as like a living art form.

968
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:35,810
It is,

969
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:36,680
it's like alive.

970
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,810
It's alive and it's like a little animal.

971
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:40,290
I like taking her exam.

972
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:40,581
I think it,

973
00:26:40,581 --> 00:26:41,540
most things a little animals,

974
00:26:41,541 --> 00:26:42,270
but it's right in front of,

975
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:43,680
and it's different with each audience.

976
00:26:43,681 --> 00:26:44,370
There's no,

977
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:45,121
I say that some of the other day,

978
00:26:45,121 --> 00:26:47,730
what's weird about comedy is that if
you were looking at it scientifically,

979
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:49,380
there is no control group.

980
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:50,760
There's never a point where you're like,

981
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:54,180
this joke existed in this perfect
vacuum and here's how it should be.

982
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:55,980
And then you test it
on different audiences.

983
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:59,100
It's difficult to tame because it's
different every single time and your

984
00:26:59,101 --> 00:27:00,540
variables change every time.

985
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:01,321
Yeah.

986
00:27:01,321 --> 00:27:03,720
But that's cause you're good
people that are not good.

987
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:04,670
We've all seen them.

988
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:06,470
They start out the same way every night.

989
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,820
They end the same way every night.

990
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:09,171
They press play,

991
00:27:09,171 --> 00:27:09,411
click,

992
00:27:09,411 --> 00:27:09,860
click,

993
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:11,360
and they have an act.

994
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:12,160
Yeah.

995
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,580
To just play that act,

996
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:16,430
it was the hardest lesson I had to learn
at the beginning when I would do the

997
00:27:16,431 --> 00:27:20,990
comedy store because I have
a very energetic act and
so whatever I had for the

998
00:27:20,991 --> 00:27:21,740
first,

999
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:23,540
whatever 20 minutes I
had when I first started,

1000
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,840
I would do that and I would
just pound the audience with it.

1001
00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:28,390
Not giving sound.

1002
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:29,680
I can't believe I'm
talking about this room,

1003
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:31,220
but not giving it a chance to breathe.

1004
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:31,791
Not,

1005
00:27:31,791 --> 00:27:32,031
you know,

1006
00:27:32,031 --> 00:27:33,110
Tommy at the comedy store,

1007
00:27:33,111 --> 00:27:33,861
like I sound like him.

1008
00:27:33,861 --> 00:27:34,030
Right?

1009
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:34,863
Why does he say that?

1010
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:35,210
Well,

1011
00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:37,130
I'm gonna get your Bates Ryan Chi.

1012
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:38,060
It's a living.

1013
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:38,630
You have to,

1014
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:39,463
you have to.

1015
00:27:39,530 --> 00:27:40,280
You don't talking about,

1016
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:43,260
I know he doesn't ever talk to me about,

1017
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:44,900
I haven't talked to him in seven years,

1018
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:48,020
but even back then he doesn't
talk to me about a comma.

1019
00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:48,291
No.

1020
00:27:48,291 --> 00:27:50,450
And he wouldn't be doing it now for sure.

1021
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,190
He imparts this wisdom anyway,

1022
00:27:52,191 --> 00:27:53,750
but he w I W I can't.

1023
00:27:53,751 --> 00:27:55,100
What I'm saying is he was right in that.

1024
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,473
You got to

1025
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:57,560
Brian.

1026
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:58,140
Oh,

1027
00:27:58,140 --> 00:27:59,020
it's like a fine wine.

1028
00:27:59,080 --> 00:27:59,291
You know.

1029
00:27:59,291 --> 00:28:01,630
Missy knows and I know how to tell people.

1030
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,910
You build a lot of prey,

1031
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:04,640
but it,

1032
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,281
you get up there,

1033
00:28:05,281 --> 00:28:06,630
you got to let the audience,

1034
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:07,650
you got to gauge them.

1035
00:28:07,651 --> 00:28:08,484
Give it a second.

1036
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:09,361
Like I had to learn.

1037
00:28:09,361 --> 00:28:10,650
I can't just go on stage and be like,

1038
00:28:10,651 --> 00:28:11,251
how's everybody doing?

1039
00:28:11,251 --> 00:28:12,120
So pizza.

1040
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:13,260
Yeah,

1041
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:14,760
sometimes you can sometimes,

1042
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:15,061
yeah,

1043
00:28:15,061 --> 00:28:15,900
sometimes you cannot.

1044
00:28:15,901 --> 00:28:19,590
And when you find that connection with
the audience and then you ride that wave.

1045
00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:23,130
I was on the plane coming
home from Orlando and I
listened to something that I'm

1046
00:28:23,131 --> 00:28:24,710
going to recommend that every comedian,

1047
00:28:24,711 --> 00:28:26,210
it's pretty fucking bad ass.

1048
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:26,870
Um,

1049
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:28,760
it's a laugh.com thing.

1050
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:29,480
Um,

1051
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:34,370
I thought it was a woody Allen
standup bit and a or a standup album.

1052
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:34,821
He goes,

1053
00:28:34,821 --> 00:28:35,450
I don't,

1054
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:35,700
you know,

1055
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:38,510
I've only seen a few pieces
of woody Allen stuff.

1056
00:28:38,810 --> 00:28:41,270
I really haven't listened
to a much of his comedy.

1057
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:42,343
And uh,

1058
00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:47,530
I'm incredibly fascinated by him as a
human being just because all of the above.

1059
00:28:47,571 --> 00:28:48,650
Cause he's a creeper.

1060
00:28:48,670 --> 00:28:48,890
Yeah.

1061
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:50,890
Cause he's talented as well because he,

1062
00:28:50,891 --> 00:28:51,860
he's really funny.

1063
00:28:51,861 --> 00:28:52,370
And he was,

1064
00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:55,400
and I listened to some of his old stuff
and it was really like hypersexual and I

1065
00:28:55,401 --> 00:28:55,641
was like,

1066
00:28:55,641 --> 00:28:55,941
wow,

1067
00:28:55,941 --> 00:28:57,590
I never really noticed how sexual it was.

1068
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:58,071
And I'm like,

1069
00:28:58,071 --> 00:28:59,450
no wonder why he's such a fucking purse.

1070
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:03,410
But it's woody Allen on comedy
and it's from laugh.com.

1071
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,300
It's really fucking old.

1072
00:29:05,301 --> 00:29:10,190
I think it might be from before he was
even doing movies because there's no

1073
00:29:10,191 --> 00:29:15,050
mention of movies and it's mentioned of
like Jack Benny and Jackie Gleason and

1074
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:17,450
old school comics that
I've never heard of before.

1075
00:29:17,451 --> 00:29:17,961
And his,

1076
00:29:17,961 --> 00:29:18,560
uh,

1077
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,390
his voice sounds really young.

1078
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:21,230
That's cool.

1079
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:21,860
I listen to that.

1080
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:23,930
It's really interesting because it's just,

1081
00:29:23,931 --> 00:29:24,764
it's not comedy.

1082
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:27,190
It's just a question and answer piece on.

1083
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,310
That's it right there.

1084
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:31,400
Woody Allen on comedy and um,

1085
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:31,920
uh,

1086
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:32,680
if you're a cop,

1087
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:32,840
look,

1088
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:35,300
it's got 1203 reviews,

1089
00:29:35,301 --> 00:29:36,134
five star reviews.

1090
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:37,310
It's really fucking good.

1091
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:37,720
Yeah.

1092
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:38,030
Um,

1093
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:39,140
I just looked on,

1094
00:29:39,141 --> 00:29:39,411
you know,

1095
00:29:39,411 --> 00:29:43,240
the Google play store or Amazon
MP3 store and just downloaded it.

1096
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:47,530
I was just looking for something woody
Allen on a whim and a listen to it for

1097
00:29:47,531 --> 00:29:48,700
the first time this weekend.

1098
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:53,140
It's really fucking interesting because
first of all he's dead on the money

1099
00:29:53,141 --> 00:29:53,951
about a lot of shit,

1100
00:29:53,951 --> 00:29:58,030
but he's really honest too about like
hacks and about how some people can like

1101
00:29:58,090 --> 00:30:00,670
really kill but the audience
takes nothing from it.

1102
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:05,530
And then someone else might have like
a little less of an impact like laugh

1103
00:30:05,531 --> 00:30:05,891
wise.

1104
00:30:05,891 --> 00:30:10,060
But the audience walks away and they're
like really intrigued and feel touched

1105
00:30:10,061 --> 00:30:12,310
and connected by what that person said.

1106
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:12,821
You know,

1107
00:30:12,821 --> 00:30:15,970
I can think of a perfect example
of that is like Bill Hicks.

1108
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:19,210
Like there's some people that think bill
Hicks is the most hilarious guy ever.

1109
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:20,740
I completely disagree.

1110
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:21,371
I,

1111
00:30:21,371 --> 00:30:24,040
he's one of my all time favorite
comedians without a doubt.

1112
00:30:24,041 --> 00:30:25,150
And one of my all time,

1113
00:30:25,151 --> 00:30:28,960
most influential people that I've ever
seen perform and that I've ever listened

1114
00:30:28,961 --> 00:30:30,880
to and a hero of mine for sure.

1115
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:33,130
But I don't think he's
the funniest guy ever.

1116
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,113
I don't even need,

1117
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:34,990
yes,

1118
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:36,670
I feel that way about bill burr,

1119
00:30:36,671 --> 00:30:39,040
who I think is a genius
and I think he's hilarious.

1120
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:41,560
But when I listen to his stuff,

1121
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:42,311
it's less than,

1122
00:30:42,311 --> 00:30:44,590
I mean this in and from the highest light.

1123
00:30:44,591 --> 00:30:46,640
I guess it's less than
me laughing out loud,

1124
00:30:46,641 --> 00:30:46,731
more,

1125
00:30:46,731 --> 00:30:47,470
more me going like,

1126
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:48,310
oh my God,

1127
00:30:48,311 --> 00:30:48,870
that is such a good,

1128
00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:50,620
I think that's cause you're
a comic because you like,

1129
00:30:50,621 --> 00:30:50,730
yeah.

1130
00:30:50,730 --> 00:30:52,610
Appreciate the craft of his comics.

1131
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:54,780
He makes me laugh my fucking ass off.

1132
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:55,770
Um,

1133
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:56,221
first of all,

1134
00:30:56,221 --> 00:30:57,720
I love bill because he's a,

1135
00:30:57,721 --> 00:30:58,620
from where I'm from,

1136
00:30:58,621 --> 00:30:59,431
he's old school.

1137
00:30:59,431 --> 00:31:00,060
Boston.

1138
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:00,270
Yeah.

1139
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:03,150
Like if you want to know like
what's a Boston style of comedy?

1140
00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:05,550
His style was more Boston even than mine.

1141
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:06,590
Sure.

1142
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:09,410
It's like hyper
observational in your face.

1143
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:10,640
I would just call it east coast.

1144
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:11,180
Yes.

1145
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:12,013
I mean,

1146
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:14,840
cause then you have someone like on the
other end of the spectrum like Pablo

1147
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:14,841
Francisco,

1148
00:31:14,841 --> 00:31:16,490
who I fucking worship.

1149
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:17,721
And that's not,

1150
00:31:17,721 --> 00:31:18,800
you don't walk away from that.

1151
00:31:18,801 --> 00:31:19,011
Like,

1152
00:31:19,011 --> 00:31:19,101
oh,

1153
00:31:19,101 --> 00:31:19,731
that's a real thinker.

1154
00:31:19,731 --> 00:31:20,451
That's true for a bit.

1155
00:31:20,451 --> 00:31:22,220
But God was that fucking funny.

1156
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:22,911
Well,

1157
00:31:22,911 --> 00:31:23,960
he's all noises,

1158
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:24,770
silliness.

1159
00:31:24,770 --> 00:31:25,990
I love his own eyes,

1160
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:28,250
Pablo and person too,

1161
00:31:28,251 --> 00:31:29,900
to really appreciate the madness.

1162
00:31:29,901 --> 00:31:30,230
Like,

1163
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:30,530
oh,

1164
00:31:30,530 --> 00:31:32,180
seem Pablo on television.

1165
00:31:32,181 --> 00:31:33,770
And it's like you don't,

1166
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,740
I'm trying to figure out
what my next special,

1167
00:31:36,741 --> 00:31:37,371
how to,

1168
00:31:37,371 --> 00:31:38,204
uh,

1169
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:43,330
get a live performance to translate
directly into a DVD or a CD.

1170
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:46,360
And I think the best way when
I'm going to do my next one,

1171
00:31:46,361 --> 00:31:47,570
I'm gonna do it in a comedy club,

1172
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,440
a real small,

1173
00:31:48,441 --> 00:31:50,060
like 300 seat comedy club.

1174
00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:54,640
Because I've been doing these 2000 seat
venues and it's not the same man man

1175
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,840
doing those huge venues.

1176
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:56,681
It's just not the same.

1177
00:31:56,681 --> 00:31:57,880
The connection with the crowd,

1178
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:58,390
not as intimate.

1179
00:31:58,390 --> 00:32:01,750
I've always wanted to do
a double released DVD.

1180
00:32:01,751 --> 00:32:03,700
I'd like to do not the same set,

1181
00:32:03,701 --> 00:32:06,070
but like you'd tell them together
and one would be the big venue,

1182
00:32:06,370 --> 00:32:08,290
like a theater and then one
would be something like,

1183
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:10,120
not a Largo but something more intimate.

1184
00:32:10,770 --> 00:32:11,950
And you could is Largo seat?

1185
00:32:12,910 --> 00:32:13,301
I don't know.

1186
00:32:13,301 --> 00:32:14,620
I've never been allowed in uh,

1187
00:32:15,610 --> 00:32:16,121
like a hundred.

1188
00:32:16,121 --> 00:32:16,331
I don't know.

1189
00:32:16,331 --> 00:32:16,471
It's,

1190
00:32:16,471 --> 00:32:16,991
it's small.

1191
00:32:16,991 --> 00:32:21,040
It's smaller than have
in Margo got a club.

1192
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:21,893
Is that a click?

1193
00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:23,320
It's like super cool.

1194
00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:24,243
Is it super cool?

1195
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:25,480
It's not super cool though.

1196
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:26,380
It's like we're a band,

1197
00:32:26,381 --> 00:32:27,340
but we don't play music.

1198
00:32:27,341 --> 00:32:30,100
We just write down the notes
and then we fax them like,

1199
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:30,700
I don't know.

1200
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:33,130
Well it's a part of the
alternative comedy movement.

1201
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:34,900
Tis but perform there.

1202
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,700
But I've always wanted to sell to DVDs.

1203
00:32:36,701 --> 00:32:39,100
Just almost just to showcase
your range as a comic.

1204
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:39,231
Like,

1205
00:32:39,231 --> 00:32:39,381
look,

1206
00:32:39,381 --> 00:32:40,070
I can do an intimate

1207
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:42,140
room or dominate with a big room.

1208
00:32:43,010 --> 00:32:43,580
Yeah,

1209
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:44,111
that's a,

1210
00:32:44,111 --> 00:32:45,770
that it's a totally
different style comedy,

1211
00:32:45,771 --> 00:32:45,951
right?

1212
00:32:45,951 --> 00:32:47,480
Holy cause you can't come out,

1213
00:32:47,481 --> 00:32:49,340
you can't be in everyone's
face in a small room.

1214
00:32:49,341 --> 00:32:50,840
It's all you have to
connect with the audience.

1215
00:32:50,841 --> 00:32:51,410
It's,

1216
00:32:51,410 --> 00:32:52,970
it's like it's two different animals.

1217
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,030
There's that feeling that you get
to when you're in a comedy club,

1218
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:56,750
like uh,

1219
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:57,830
when you're in the back of the room,

1220
00:32:57,831 --> 00:32:59,990
like the smile is very contagious.

1221
00:32:59,991 --> 00:33:04,991
It's like you're overwhelmed
by the positive energy of
the room when it's doing

1222
00:33:05,001 --> 00:33:08,210
well and like to like to the laugh
factory or not the laugh factor,

1223
00:33:08,211 --> 00:33:10,220
whether the ice house
is my favorite example,

1224
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,233
the ice house,

1225
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:15,920
that main room is only seats when it's
stuffed to the gills and only gets 190

1226
00:33:15,921 --> 00:33:16,640
people in there.

1227
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,380
It's tiny and it just,

1228
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:20,570
it just lights up.

1229
00:33:20,930 --> 00:33:25,160
It's just on fire when you're in the
middle of that versus being on a stage

1230
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:26,660
that's far away from them.

1231
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:28,040
I actually,

1232
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:28,790
if I had my job,

1233
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:32,870
if I can make a living doing my comedy
is very loud and in your face and

1234
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:35,510
energetic so it lends
itself to a larger room.

1235
00:33:35,511 --> 00:33:38,360
But I really enjoy my
small alternative venues.

1236
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:42,050
I love doing them cause that you get
that connectivity and you write the most

1237
00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:43,550
and you get a chance to be like,

1238
00:33:43,551 --> 00:33:44,121
was that funny?

1239
00:33:44,121 --> 00:33:44,954
Did you like that?

1240
00:33:45,050 --> 00:33:48,950
And like you can see the disgust
on their face and right up close.

1241
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:50,810
Do you ever do the little
stage of the Ice House?

1242
00:33:50,811 --> 00:33:51,760
The the stage two?

1243
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:52,190
Yeah.

1244
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:53,330
That place is the shit.

1245
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:55,560
I like 85 90 seats or something.

1246
00:33:55,570 --> 00:33:58,670
I've done that when I've done
your show and that's cool.

1247
00:33:58,671 --> 00:33:59,121
I just just,

1248
00:33:59,121 --> 00:34:03,230
it's just a different kind of writing
and I think a good comic can go from one

1249
00:34:03,231 --> 00:34:03,651
to the other,

1250
00:34:03,651 --> 00:34:04,760
can run off and go do it.

1251
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:08,630
300 person show at the Improv and then
run to that small stage and adjust

1252
00:34:08,631 --> 00:34:09,464
accordingly.

1253
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:11,481
I agree.

1254
00:34:11,481 --> 00:34:15,620
And I think it's a really interesting
thing and news parallels I think in all

1255
00:34:15,621 --> 00:34:16,251
art forms,

1256
00:34:16,251 --> 00:34:18,140
whether it's in music or
in painting or anything,

1257
00:34:18,141 --> 00:34:21,560
everyone that I've talked to that's
an artist about creating the creative

1258
00:34:21,561 --> 00:34:26,180
process and it seems to be all
about just like focusing on it,

1259
00:34:26,210 --> 00:34:29,600
the intensity and the focus and the
dedication you have to whatever you're

1260
00:34:29,601 --> 00:34:29,961
doing,

1261
00:34:29,961 --> 00:34:30,794
whether it's uh,

1262
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:32,150
completing a set,

1263
00:34:32,151 --> 00:34:34,120
writing a joke or making a sculpture,

1264
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:35,720
whatever the fuck it is,

1265
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:39,080
it's like getting out of
the way and focusing on it,

1266
00:34:39,081 --> 00:34:42,530
but yet getting yourself out of the way
and letting that thing become whatever

1267
00:34:42,531 --> 00:34:43,364
the fuck it is.

1268
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:43,820
It's,

1269
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:44,653
it's a,

1270
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:47,570
it's a process and it also takes
time to even learn that process.

1271
00:34:47,571 --> 00:34:48,590
Like joke aside,

1272
00:34:48,591 --> 00:34:51,680
like to know I need to let this
breathe or I need to think about this.

1273
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:52,181
Like there's just,

1274
00:34:52,181 --> 00:34:54,740
and there's no right
or wrong way to do it.

1275
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:58,250
It's almost like you're lost in a comedy
forest and you've got to like figure

1276
00:34:58,251 --> 00:35:00,710
out your own way back when you have,

1277
00:35:00,711 --> 00:35:03,380
when you're onstage and you've got this
like list of jokes that you're trying to

1278
00:35:03,381 --> 00:35:06,290
work out or the beats and there's no
right way to put that set list and an

1279
00:35:06,291 --> 00:35:06,561
order.

1280
00:35:06,561 --> 00:35:08,480
It's like a weird science.

1281
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:09,510
Yeah.

1282
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:11,900
And it's a weird science and
no one can fucking teach you.

1283
00:35:11,990 --> 00:35:12,950
You cannot be taught.

1284
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:14,240
That's my other thing.

1285
00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:17,180
I have a friend who's a comedy
coach and she's hilarious.

1286
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:18,830
So she is the exception to this rule.

1287
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:19,741
But in general,

1288
00:35:19,741 --> 00:35:22,700
like that's why most people
that like teach comedy classes,

1289
00:35:22,701 --> 00:35:26,090
it's like you've never heard them have
them because those who can't do and those

1290
00:35:26,091 --> 00:35:26,870
who can't teach,

1291
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:27,703
um,

1292
00:35:28,050 --> 00:35:28,881
because we can do,

1293
00:35:28,881 --> 00:35:29,714
and those who can't teach,

1294
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:31,850
but you can't be taught
all these comedy classes,

1295
00:35:31,851 --> 00:35:32,541
comedy lectures,

1296
00:35:32,541 --> 00:35:33,374
comedy seminars,

1297
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,191
and even right now,

1298
00:35:34,191 --> 00:35:35,420
like you can listen to us all you want,

1299
00:35:35,421 --> 00:35:36,111
but at the end of the day,

1300
00:35:36,111 --> 00:35:38,070
if you don't get up tonight and do

1301
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:39,690
like those three minutes that scare you,

1302
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,130
you're never going to be anything.

1303
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:42,780
I agree with you wholeheartedly,

1304
00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:46,860
but I think where it benefits is someone
who's listening to this can get the

1305
00:35:46,861 --> 00:35:50,610
Eliza slessinger take on
on comedy and apply it,

1306
00:35:50,850 --> 00:35:53,460
learn from their own real career,

1307
00:35:54,730 --> 00:35:55,563
blah,

1308
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:56,940
put it in their database.

1309
00:35:56,941 --> 00:35:59,760
And like I was saying about
Woody Allen on comedy,

1310
00:35:59,761 --> 00:36:00,031
I mean,

1311
00:36:00,031 --> 00:36:04,710
I've been doing comedy for 20 fucking
something years and listening to Woody

1312
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:05,161
Allen on comedy,

1313
00:36:05,161 --> 00:36:05,490
I was like,

1314
00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:05,920
Ooh,

1315
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:06,570
okay.

1316
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:07,403
Oh right.

1317
00:36:07,490 --> 00:36:08,400
You should listen to everyone.

1318
00:36:08,401 --> 00:36:09,091
You should take notes.

1319
00:36:09,091 --> 00:36:10,650
You should watch comics that you like.

1320
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:11,550
But at the end of the day,

1321
00:36:11,551 --> 00:36:14,070
if you don't practice
yes that it's worthless.

1322
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:17,520
Blogger comedy blogger,

1323
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:18,480
will the,

1324
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,850
have you ever seen
people that raped my DVD?

1325
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:21,713
Just saying random.

1326
00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:23,550
Have you ever seen a comedy?

1327
00:36:23,551 --> 00:36:25,770
Bloggers try to go on stage
and they think they're cute.

1328
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:26,461
No,

1329
00:36:26,461 --> 00:36:28,560
but he plays a shit of course.

1330
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,191
And then you want to be like,

1331
00:36:29,191 --> 00:36:31,310
let me review your performance asshole,

1332
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:33,960
who we started out where
you can finish them weaker.

1333
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:34,411
Well,

1334
00:36:34,411 --> 00:36:36,660
it's one of those things where you can't,

1335
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:39,480
there's no shortcuts to doing stand up.

1336
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:40,920
No one can teach you how to do it.

1337
00:36:40,921 --> 00:36:42,330
But what we can show catch,

1338
00:36:42,331 --> 00:36:44,760
you can get a horrible show and
then you can sell out arenas.

1339
00:36:44,761 --> 00:36:45,080
The rest of,

1340
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:45,870
there's no shortcuts.

1341
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:46,451
When you go up there,

1342
00:36:46,451 --> 00:36:49,350
you still eat shit that's
even more frightening.

1343
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:51,150
That's the Michael Richard Scenario.

1344
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:53,040
When you were a hugely famous,

1345
00:36:53,041 --> 00:36:55,140
very successful world,

1346
00:36:55,141 --> 00:36:59,460
loved math and then you go on
stage and eat plates of Shit.

1347
00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:04,110
Well he was saying the
n word because he was,

1348
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:05,100
first of all,

1349
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:05,490
I called,

1350
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:06,690
I'm pretty sure he was coked up.

1351
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,420
And I say this is a person
who's never done coke.

1352
00:37:09,570 --> 00:37:13,200
So I don't really totally know the coke
attitude other than like watching it

1353
00:37:13,201 --> 00:37:14,034
from afar.

1354
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:14,760
But uh,

1355
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,370
you've been blanche up
to the microphone is not,

1356
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:18,990
you can't keep her away from
you for just a few minutes.

1357
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:19,771
I would,

1358
00:37:19,771 --> 00:37:21,460
I speaking

1359
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:25,140
she's a little sweetie.

1360
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:26,490
Um,

1361
00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:30,540
Michael Richards was at the comedy store
before he had his famous meltdown that

1362
00:37:30,541 --> 00:37:31,470
night at the laugh factor.

1363
00:37:31,471 --> 00:37:35,160
He had two sets that night
and Brent Ernst came up to me,

1364
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:35,910
um,

1365
00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:37,430
after the laugh factory one.

1366
00:37:37,450 --> 00:37:37,710
Yeah,

1367
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:38,840
he came over to the stores.

1368
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:39,061
Like,

1369
00:37:39,061 --> 00:37:39,391
dude,

1370
00:37:39,391 --> 00:37:42,570
I just saw the craziest
shit cause he was there.

1371
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:43,530
He's like,

1372
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:44,190
he goes,

1373
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:46,670
that fucking Michael
Richards guy goes on stage,

1374
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:48,150
the laugh factory is eating shit.

1375
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,680
These black guys started heckle him.

1376
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,480
He starts tossing around the end bomb.

1377
00:37:51,481 --> 00:37:51,751
I go,

1378
00:37:51,751 --> 00:37:52,584
no.

1379
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:53,041
He goes,

1380
00:37:53,041 --> 00:37:53,491
yes.

1381
00:37:53,491 --> 00:37:53,940
He goes,

1382
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:55,230
look there's a nigger.

1383
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:58,740
And he starts pointing at them and sang
it and Brent Arts is saying this and

1384
00:37:58,741 --> 00:37:59,910
we're like holding her face.

1385
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:02,730
The of out of the store
were like no he didn't.

1386
00:38:02,731 --> 00:38:06,540
I guess he did but I thought it was going
to end there and then someone fucking,

1387
00:38:06,541 --> 00:38:09,000
it was like one of the very first time
someone filmed something with their

1388
00:38:09,001 --> 00:38:09,834
camera.

1389
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:14,520
But we watched Michael Richards have
these really tough sets and it was really

1390
00:38:14,521 --> 00:38:19,521
weird because he's this guy super
famous and he would go onstage and just

1391
00:38:20,431 --> 00:38:21,570
fucking bomb.

1392
00:38:21,571 --> 00:38:22,404
He had nothing.

1393
00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:24,040
He was an open miker me,

1394
00:38:24,050 --> 00:38:27,720
he was an open mic or that
was super confident and he
would get these big rounds

1395
00:38:27,721 --> 00:38:29,700
of applause when he'd get on the stage.

1396
00:38:29,701 --> 00:38:31,200
Like everybody be so excited.

1397
00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:33,860
And then he would like
to prat falls and it,

1398
00:38:33,861 --> 00:38:36,010
but it would never
translate without the rest

1399
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:37,630
of the cast without a writer.

1400
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:38,320
Right.

1401
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,880
I mean that's a thing about sitcoms.

1402
00:38:39,881 --> 00:38:43,930
It's like a re sitcom writers are
some of the most undervalued and

1403
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:48,340
underappreciated people in the
world of like making those stars.

1404
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:51,790
Like there's a whole
slew of people that are,

1405
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:52,151
you know,

1406
00:38:52,151 --> 00:38:52,570
they may,

1407
00:38:52,570 --> 00:38:55,000
might not ever be great comics themselves,

1408
00:38:55,001 --> 00:38:59,910
but they know how to craft material
for a guy like Richard was.

1409
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:04,920
Is it Ray Romano or is it Jerry
Seinfeld that's someone says,

1410
00:39:05,051 --> 00:39:08,920
I think about like how you're given
that x amount of minutes when you get

1411
00:39:08,921 --> 00:39:09,460
onstage,

1412
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:10,350
when you're someone phases.

1413
00:39:10,730 --> 00:39:10,990
Yeah,

1414
00:39:10,990 --> 00:39:11,620
they give you,

1415
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:14,530
they give you that and that's what the
applause on the courtesy labs because

1416
00:39:14,531 --> 00:39:15,850
they're waiting for something good.

1417
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:20,050
I've seen plenty of comics who are movie
stars maybe started as comics and then

1418
00:39:20,051 --> 00:39:21,790
became something else and
they go back and you're like,

1419
00:39:21,791 --> 00:39:22,690
this is horrible.

1420
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:25,450
Or I was talking about this
with somebody last night.

1421
00:39:26,050 --> 00:39:27,730
I'll have people that
I think are very funny.

1422
00:39:27,731 --> 00:39:30,040
And then on Twitter it doesn't translate.

1423
00:39:30,730 --> 00:39:34,600
And I think a versatile comic that he was
between a standup comedian and a funny

1424
00:39:34,601 --> 00:39:38,740
person is somebody that is able to
be ver to do it on any platform.

1425
00:39:38,741 --> 00:39:43,540
You can be funny in person or in the
writing or 140 characters or on a script.

1426
00:39:43,570 --> 00:39:46,970
Like that's when you
have comedy in you man,

1427
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:50,920
your performer versus muscle that
you're kind of comedy like some,

1428
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:54,670
some kinds of comedy just do not
translate in the written form.

1429
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:55,631
Some don't.

1430
00:39:55,631 --> 00:39:56,890
And that's the example.

1431
00:39:56,891 --> 00:39:57,850
Like here's Michael Richards.

1432
00:39:57,851 --> 00:39:58,870
You're not a standup comic.

1433
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,250
Maybe did it at one point,

1434
00:40:00,251 --> 00:40:01,330
but people think,

1435
00:40:01,331 --> 00:40:02,380
and this is not about him,

1436
00:40:02,381 --> 00:40:04,660
but I think that's where ego
gets into it cause you're like,

1437
00:40:04,661 --> 00:40:05,220
Whoa,

1438
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:05,710
I'm fucking funny.

1439
00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:06,670
When people write my stuff down,

1440
00:40:06,671 --> 00:40:07,450
I could do this.

1441
00:40:07,450 --> 00:40:12,430
So many people and it drives me to take
my art form that I hold near and dear to

1442
00:40:12,431 --> 00:40:13,390
me and that standup comedy.

1443
00:40:13,391 --> 00:40:13,780
And they're like,

1444
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:14,613
I could do that.

1445
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:14,771
Hey,

1446
00:40:14,771 --> 00:40:15,820
I'm doing standup now.

1447
00:40:15,821 --> 00:40:16,090
I'm like,

1448
00:40:16,090 --> 00:40:16,923
Oh are you?

1449
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:18,040
Or is it doing you?

1450
00:40:18,910 --> 00:40:19,391
Oh are,

1451
00:40:19,391 --> 00:40:19,481
oh,

1452
00:40:19,481 --> 00:40:20,920
you're just going to give it a whirl.

1453
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:21,611
Okay,

1454
00:40:21,611 --> 00:40:21,971
cool.

1455
00:40:21,971 --> 00:40:22,660
That's like,

1456
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:23,770
it's almost like it's my,

1457
00:40:23,830 --> 00:40:26,620
it's my craft and very protective of,

1458
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:27,930
of all that it entailed.

1459
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:31,020
Use exclusive like to tell in a,

1460
00:40:31,030 --> 00:40:33,070
do you feel like exclusionary like that?

1461
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,230
Do you think like what do you mean?

1462
00:40:35,231 --> 00:40:36,064
Like I have the tea,

1463
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:37,900
the totally opposite attitude.

1464
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:39,440
Like if someone says a,

1465
00:40:39,441 --> 00:40:40,420
I think I could do that.

1466
00:40:40,450 --> 00:40:41,470
I'm going to do standup comedy.

1467
00:40:41,471 --> 00:40:41,711
I'm like,

1468
00:40:41,711 --> 00:40:42,340
you could do it.

1469
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:43,060
Anyone can do it.

1470
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:43,810
You can do it.

1471
00:40:43,810 --> 00:40:44,590
Anyone can do it.

1472
00:40:44,590 --> 00:40:45,580
You just have to figure it out.

1473
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:46,660
If your objective,

1474
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:47,513
you can figure it out.

1475
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:49,540
I don't begrudge anyone the,

1476
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,010
and I want them to go
up there and be funny.

1477
00:40:51,011 --> 00:40:52,030
I love funny people.

1478
00:40:52,210 --> 00:40:56,260
I think my thing is people say it as
if like I'm going to take a pottery

1479
00:40:56,261 --> 00:40:56,770
workshop,

1480
00:40:56,770 --> 00:40:59,320
like I'm going to give standup
oral and it's almost this,

1481
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:04,120
I've had friends or I've known people
that have done it and they eat shit that

1482
00:41:04,121 --> 00:41:05,860
they thought they did a
good job or they're like,

1483
00:41:05,861 --> 00:41:06,970
this is part of my thing.

1484
00:41:06,971 --> 00:41:07,361
I'm like,

1485
00:41:07,361 --> 00:41:08,560
I want these jokes to be weird.

1486
00:41:08,561 --> 00:41:09,390
And you're like,

1487
00:41:09,390 --> 00:41:09,881
all right.

1488
00:41:09,881 --> 00:41:11,140
So what just happened was the,

1489
00:41:11,170 --> 00:41:14,710
you just killed the energy that I've got
to go dig myself out of a fucking hole.

1490
00:41:14,711 --> 00:41:16,060
Now my four year old does that.

1491
00:41:16,061 --> 00:41:17,320
Like she'll fall down and go,

1492
00:41:17,321 --> 00:41:18,154
I meant to do that.

1493
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:19,023
I meant to do that.

1494
00:41:19,570 --> 00:41:23,950
The quicker you get over the fact that
everyone falls and you should never lie

1495
00:41:23,951 --> 00:41:25,420
because everyone knows that you fell.

1496
00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:26,980
Moral is don't be a liar.

1497
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:30,790
Don't try to trick people to make yourself
feel better because it doesn't ever

1498
00:41:30,791 --> 00:41:31,091
work.

1499
00:41:31,091 --> 00:41:32,770
It's like name dropping that shit.

1500
00:41:33,530 --> 00:41:34,363
No one,

1501
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,920
no one never has never will.

1502
00:41:36,921 --> 00:41:38,480
It just makes you look
like a fucking idiot,

1503
00:41:38,481 --> 00:41:38,621
you know,

1504
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:38,960
like,

1505
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:39,171
well,

1506
00:41:39,171 --> 00:41:39,441
you know,

1507
00:41:39,441 --> 00:41:41,870
we're hanging out with David Copperfield
the other night and like no one,

1508
00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:43,160
no one gives a fuck.

1509
00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:43,760
Nobody gives us,

1510
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,020
not only do they not give a fuck,

1511
00:41:45,021 --> 00:41:47,960
they respect you less for namedropping
the old and what is tough,

1512
00:41:47,961 --> 00:41:51,350
I will say this on the rare occasion
that I'm with somebody that is famous or

1513
00:41:51,351 --> 00:41:52,520
that is like cool.

1514
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,360
I almost,

1515
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,740
because I was so painfully sell for,

1516
00:41:54,741 --> 00:41:55,580
I preface it with,

1517
00:41:55,790 --> 00:41:56,960
I'm not trying to sound like a jerk,

1518
00:41:57,290 --> 00:41:59,000
like whatever Brad Pitt is
not the guy in the store,

1519
00:41:59,001 --> 00:42:00,020
but Brad Pitt was there.

1520
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:01,010
I don't know him.

1521
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:01,881
He was at the party.

1522
00:42:01,881 --> 00:42:02,990
Here's the rest of the story.

1523
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:05,090
It's letting you know that
like we don't hang out,

1524
00:42:05,450 --> 00:42:06,410
but I was next to bribery.

1525
00:42:06,890 --> 00:42:08,120
You being aware,

1526
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:11,690
being aware of how Douchey it
could sound to name drop Brad Pitt,

1527
00:42:11,810 --> 00:42:13,610
whereas a person who's unaware,

1528
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:16,280
unaware people are
really frustrating to me.

1529
00:42:16,430 --> 00:42:17,540
Like people are just lucky.

1530
00:42:17,541 --> 00:42:18,374
I'm just kidding.

1531
00:42:19,490 --> 00:42:23,120
The frustrating goofiness of
being unaware is it's very,

1532
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:25,160
to me it bothers me because,

1533
00:42:25,161 --> 00:42:25,940
um,

1534
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:30,020
I think that all comics in WWE in some
way or form or kind of chameleons,

1535
00:42:30,350 --> 00:42:31,250
I think we sort of,

1536
00:42:31,251 --> 00:42:31,450
uh,

1537
00:42:31,450 --> 00:42:31,880
uh,

1538
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:32,270
we,

1539
00:42:32,270 --> 00:42:34,220
we sort of absorb a lot of,

1540
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:35,600
like a lot of who I am.

1541
00:42:35,601 --> 00:42:35,991
Like what,

1542
00:42:35,991 --> 00:42:39,290
what makes me like a comic is like
a lot of funny people that I knew,

1543
00:42:39,470 --> 00:42:40,850
people that I grew up with,

1544
00:42:41,210 --> 00:42:43,430
people that I ran into
that said funny things.

1545
00:42:43,430 --> 00:42:44,263
And I've sort of like,

1546
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:45,930
I think all of us sponge,

1547
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:50,150
I mean that's just even the most unique
personality ever uses the English

1548
00:42:50,151 --> 00:42:53,870
language and uses it in a form that
people have used for thousands of years.

1549
00:42:54,050 --> 00:42:56,480
I mean it's like even the combination
of words that you use that are

1550
00:42:56,481 --> 00:42:57,470
particularly unique,

1551
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:01,790
you use it because you've sort of seen a
million different examples of how other

1552
00:43:01,791 --> 00:43:05,660
people use the English language and
you've kind of like taking a little bit of

1553
00:43:05,661 --> 00:43:09,080
this and added a little bit of that and
always a combination of Jackie Gleason

1554
00:43:09,081 --> 00:43:10,500
and Sam Kennison and you know,

1555
00:43:10,550 --> 00:43:15,170
I think that hyper awareness
kind of takes the wonder out of,

1556
00:43:15,230 --> 00:43:16,820
or it's always takes the
mystery out of people.

1557
00:43:16,821 --> 00:43:19,400
Like even if we were to like talk
about like even in the dating world,

1558
00:43:19,401 --> 00:43:21,470
some guy walks in and he's got like,

1559
00:43:21,650 --> 00:43:22,760
like a Johnny Depp thing,

1560
00:43:22,761 --> 00:43:25,480
like maybe like a bunch of
necklaces and like a shirt open.

1561
00:43:25,490 --> 00:43:25,821
I'm like,

1562
00:43:25,821 --> 00:43:28,640
you purposefully put
on all those necklaces,

1563
00:43:28,910 --> 00:43:29,930
you're not a pirate.

1564
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:33,920
When I see like punk rockers and
they've got like a Mohawk and I'm like,

1565
00:43:33,921 --> 00:43:37,190
I'm just imagining this super tough punk
rock or sitting there with hair putty

1566
00:43:37,191 --> 00:43:42,050
for four hours sculpting this and it
just takes the mystique out of all of it.

1567
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:43,280
Cause you have to think about it.

1568
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:43,881
Think about it.

1569
00:43:43,881 --> 00:43:44,780
No one is original.

1570
00:43:44,810 --> 00:43:45,680
Everything is horrible.

1571
00:43:45,710 --> 00:43:46,810
Can I?

1572
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:52,460
Well you can be original
or you can be uniquely you,

1573
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:54,380
but you're not a hundred percent original.

1574
00:43:54,381 --> 00:43:55,310
It's impossible.

1575
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:56,011
It's impossible.

1576
00:43:56,011 --> 00:44:00,290
And so we come from a culture that has
existed for hundreds of years and it's a

1577
00:44:00,291 --> 00:44:01,490
part of a civilization,

1578
00:44:01,491 --> 00:44:04,010
human civilization that's
existed for thousands of years.

1579
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:05,660
And there's just no
getting away from that.

1580
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:06,710
You can't get out of your roots.

1581
00:44:06,711 --> 00:44:08,720
You're not going to be
wholly and completely unique.

1582
00:44:08,950 --> 00:44:09,221
Uh,

1583
00:44:09,221 --> 00:44:10,430
I actually am working on,

1584
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:11,360
this is also a comic thing,

1585
00:44:11,361 --> 00:44:13,400
like prefacing it with
working on a bit about,

1586
00:44:13,401 --> 00:44:15,950
but girls and men do it too obviously.

1587
00:44:15,951 --> 00:44:20,060
But like girls have this when you are
part of a homogeneous mixture of people,

1588
00:44:20,090 --> 00:44:20,241
like,

1589
00:44:20,241 --> 00:44:21,690
and when you go to high school
where everyone's blonde,

1590
00:44:21,740 --> 00:44:22,260
everyone's chill,

1591
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:25,520
everything's says girls always find that,

1592
00:44:25,550 --> 00:44:27,740
have this desire to set themselves apart.

1593
00:44:27,741 --> 00:44:30,530
And it's always something
like I'm one 18th Cherokee,

1594
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:32,040
my mom

1595
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:34,710
was Spanish and it's
just like you are white.

1596
00:44:34,950 --> 00:44:36,120
Nobody cares.

1597
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:38,540
And it's this desire
to set ourselves apart.

1598
00:44:38,541 --> 00:44:40,530
Cause we're always told that
we're special and we're different.

1599
00:44:40,590 --> 00:44:41,310
Right?

1600
00:44:41,310 --> 00:44:42,061
So that's,

1601
00:44:42,061 --> 00:44:42,301
you know,

1602
00:44:42,301 --> 00:44:43,020
or even like,

1603
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:43,171
oh,

1604
00:44:43,171 --> 00:44:44,850
your last name is whatever.

1605
00:44:44,851 --> 00:44:45,420
Like,

1606
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:46,051
Oh Donald.

1607
00:44:46,051 --> 00:44:46,411
And you're like,

1608
00:44:46,411 --> 00:44:46,710
yeah,

1609
00:44:46,710 --> 00:44:47,670
Irish pride.

1610
00:44:47,671 --> 00:44:48,600
And it's like your great,

1611
00:44:48,601 --> 00:44:49,860
great grandmother was Irish.

1612
00:44:49,861 --> 00:44:50,521
Like that's it.

1613
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:52,490
You've never been nothing about use,

1614
00:44:52,491 --> 00:44:53,460
particularly Irish.

1615
00:44:53,490 --> 00:44:55,170
I can drink just as much as you like.

1616
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:56,340
People love that.

1617
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,260
They'll look to their
heritage to separate them.

1618
00:44:58,440 --> 00:44:59,430
And when that doesn't do it,

1619
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:02,310
they'll look to where they were
born or where they were conceived.

1620
00:45:02,370 --> 00:45:03,780
Anything to set them apart.

1621
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:05,450
My friend Marcus Davis,

1622
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:06,470
he's a fighter.

1623
00:45:06,550 --> 00:45:08,590
He used to fight for the
UFC in these a yacht.

1624
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:09,490
It's pretty hot.

1625
00:45:09,490 --> 00:45:10,323
Is good looking man.

1626
00:45:10,330 --> 00:45:10,760
Alright,

1627
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:12,140
so studly manly man.

1628
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:12,681
But,

1629
00:45:12,681 --> 00:45:12,980
uh,

1630
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:14,270
he's from Maine and,

1631
00:45:14,271 --> 00:45:14,630
uh,

1632
00:45:14,630 --> 00:45:17,330
he's a Boston main area and he's,

1633
00:45:17,331 --> 00:45:18,164
um,

1634
00:45:18,470 --> 00:45:18,861
you know,

1635
00:45:18,861 --> 00:45:19,251
grew up,

1636
00:45:19,251 --> 00:45:22,070
I think at Boston lives in May now
cause he just likes it up there.

1637
00:45:22,310 --> 00:45:25,130
But Very Irish like into Irish would,

1638
00:45:25,190 --> 00:45:25,701
he would fight,

1639
00:45:25,701 --> 00:45:26,960
would go out to the house of pain,

1640
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:27,471
you know,

1641
00:45:27,471 --> 00:45:28,070
and you know,

1642
00:45:28,070 --> 00:45:29,340
like a painter as well.

1643
00:45:29,341 --> 00:45:30,174
What Irish people

1644
00:45:32,350 --> 00:45:32,901
jump up,

1645
00:45:32,901 --> 00:45:33,734
jump up again.

1646
00:45:34,050 --> 00:45:35,930
We've heard it four times
when we play something else.

1647
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:37,760
One more time.

1648
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:38,361
One more time.

1649
00:45:38,361 --> 00:45:38,870
Slowly.

1650
00:45:38,870 --> 00:45:38,990
Yeah.

1651
00:45:38,990 --> 00:45:39,830
Acoustic version.

1652
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:40,813
And um,

1653
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:41,241
anyway,

1654
00:45:41,241 --> 00:45:42,470
he fought another friend of mine,

1655
00:45:42,471 --> 00:45:43,011
Dan Hardy,

1656
00:45:43,011 --> 00:45:43,431
who's a,

1657
00:45:43,431 --> 00:45:44,040
an English man,

1658
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:46,280
a real English might
like from England and uh,

1659
00:45:46,340 --> 00:45:48,530
Dan Hardee was mocking him,

1660
00:45:48,710 --> 00:45:50,080
calling him a fake Irishman,

1661
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:50,510
you know,

1662
00:45:50,510 --> 00:45:50,781
I was like,

1663
00:45:50,781 --> 00:45:51,950
he's like half Irish,

1664
00:45:51,951 --> 00:45:52,680
like claiming I,

1665
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:54,280
and he just mocked him the entire campus.

1666
00:45:54,290 --> 00:45:56,720
Fager and by the time they
got into the cage together,

1667
00:45:58,520 --> 00:45:59,810
he was so angry.

1668
00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:03,740
He was so pissed at Dan because
Dan was calling him a fake.

1669
00:46:03,890 --> 00:46:05,090
Marcus was just out of his head.

1670
00:46:05,091 --> 00:46:05,750
Like he didn't,

1671
00:46:05,750 --> 00:46:08,600
didn't fight up to his potential
just because he was so emotional.

1672
00:46:08,601 --> 00:46:09,380
He didn't use it.

1673
00:46:09,380 --> 00:46:10,280
While he just couldn't,

1674
00:46:10,310 --> 00:46:10,791
well it's not,

1675
00:46:10,791 --> 00:46:11,510
you don't really know.

1676
00:46:11,510 --> 00:46:12,620
The Irish aren't very bright.

1677
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:13,280
No,

1678
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:15,920
that's totally the things I said.

1679
00:46:15,921 --> 00:46:16,940
That's the one we were like,

1680
00:46:17,030 --> 00:46:17,391
no,

1681
00:46:17,391 --> 00:46:19,010
please don't think that we
have a thing against the Irish.

1682
00:46:19,590 --> 00:46:21,550
Emotions are your enemy.

1683
00:46:21,610 --> 00:46:22,780
And when it comes to fighting,

1684
00:46:22,930 --> 00:46:23,770
when you a,

1685
00:46:23,771 --> 00:46:26,110
when you get too vested in,

1686
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:26,680
you know,

1687
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:26,920
the,

1688
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:28,480
the pressure of kicking someone's ass,

1689
00:46:28,750 --> 00:46:29,583
it just can be,

1690
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:30,513
it's too much.

1691
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:31,220
It makes it,

1692
00:46:31,220 --> 00:46:31,910
it makes it,

1693
00:46:31,910 --> 00:46:32,800
but I would imagine,

1694
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:34,210
have you ever had a little hair puller?

1695
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:35,770
A fucking no.

1696
00:46:35,771 --> 00:46:36,790
I went to college.

1697
00:46:36,791 --> 00:46:39,130
I'm not going to get
people in college fight.

1698
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:41,320
I think if you are not a real fighter,

1699
00:46:41,550 --> 00:46:41,760
I'm want,

1700
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:41,920
see,

1701
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:42,550
I'm speaking to women.

1702
00:46:42,550 --> 00:46:45,010
It is the ultimate white
trash move to get in a fight.

1703
00:46:45,310 --> 00:46:45,910
Really?

1704
00:46:45,910 --> 00:46:46,743
Yeah.

1705
00:46:46,860 --> 00:46:50,610
Because that means my words that I use
to make a living and feed my dog have

1706
00:46:50,611 --> 00:46:51,990
exhausted me and um,

1707
00:46:52,590 --> 00:46:52,891
I,

1708
00:46:52,891 --> 00:46:54,300
I'm going to have to resort to violence.

1709
00:46:55,290 --> 00:46:56,190
How much you've gotten me.

1710
00:46:56,820 --> 00:46:58,500
I don't understand that mentality.

1711
00:46:58,501 --> 00:46:59,281
If you're a real fire,

1712
00:46:59,281 --> 00:47:01,320
I guess that's different cause
that's what you would go to.

1713
00:47:01,321 --> 00:47:03,030
Or probably if you're real far do,

1714
00:47:03,031 --> 00:47:05,820
you would never find anyone randomly
because you have too much to lose and you

1715
00:47:05,821 --> 00:47:06,654
could probably kill them.

1716
00:47:06,950 --> 00:47:08,900
Well also you realize how dumb it is.

1717
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:09,300
It's,

1718
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:09,561
it's,

1719
00:47:09,561 --> 00:47:10,310
it's dumb,

1720
00:47:10,310 --> 00:47:10,551
you know,

1721
00:47:10,551 --> 00:47:11,384
would fighting,

1722
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:12,860
well not fighting.

1723
00:47:12,861 --> 00:47:13,760
Let me fight with fighting.

1724
00:47:13,761 --> 00:47:15,920
Really is is like what
fighting is with animals.

1725
00:47:15,921 --> 00:47:18,470
It's just like it's combat,

1726
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:21,680
but when you're thinking
about martial arts,

1727
00:47:21,740 --> 00:47:22,480
martial arts,

1728
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:22,760
the,

1729
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:26,720
the last person that you would expect
to see in a fight as a martial artist,

1730
00:47:26,750 --> 00:47:27,100
right?

1731
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:30,100
A smart martial artists would be able
to figure out way out of the situation

1732
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:31,420
long before it ever escalated.

1733
00:47:31,570 --> 00:47:32,620
Most likely,

1734
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:36,370
unless you're just in the worst case
scenario with the worst aggressive drunks

1735
00:47:36,371 --> 00:47:38,740
and dangerous people and
you've got to defend yourself.

1736
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:39,821
Two things.

1737
00:47:39,821 --> 00:47:40,121
One,

1738
00:47:40,121 --> 00:47:43,750
I'm slightly obsessed with Ronda Rousey
and I follow her and slightly every time

1739
00:47:43,751 --> 00:47:44,261
I see you,

1740
00:47:44,261 --> 00:47:44,561
you're like,

1741
00:47:44,561 --> 00:47:46,970
I got to be right because she is like,

1742
00:47:46,990 --> 00:47:47,920
I think I'm pretty tough girl,

1743
00:47:47,921 --> 00:47:49,060
but like she takes it to a hold of,

1744
00:47:49,330 --> 00:47:50,560
she'll make you uncomfortable.

1745
00:47:50,590 --> 00:47:51,371
She's so cool,

1746
00:47:51,371 --> 00:47:53,230
but I feel like we'll
be best friends anyway.

1747
00:47:53,231 --> 00:47:54,220
I wrote a bit about her.

1748
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:57,640
Did you look it up?

1749
00:47:57,641 --> 00:47:59,320
How about the next time you
come on I'll bring Rhonda.

1750
00:47:59,590 --> 00:48:02,080
I really want that because I
have so many things to tell her.

1751
00:48:02,081 --> 00:48:02,914
Also,

1752
00:48:03,070 --> 00:48:05,990
I think she's really pretty and I follow
Instagram and I'm really excited that

1753
00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:07,213
careers,

1754
00:48:08,150 --> 00:48:08,983
the back of your hair,

1755
00:48:09,580 --> 00:48:13,270
you will never see a fight or get taken
down quicker than if she tried to kiss

1756
00:48:13,271 --> 00:48:13,480
me,

1757
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:15,820
you would take her down on the rousing.

1758
00:48:15,821 --> 00:48:16,654
So what I'm saying,

1759
00:48:16,710 --> 00:48:17,760
she know.

1760
00:48:17,890 --> 00:48:20,140
Why would she kiss me
just to fucking dominate,

1761
00:48:20,141 --> 00:48:20,740
you know,

1762
00:48:20,740 --> 00:48:23,640
just to go Alfon you know you're a really
strong chick and think it works that

1763
00:48:23,641 --> 00:48:26,590
way for women gets bigger right here.

1764
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:28,540
Oh my fucking God.

1765
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:30,100
Long Gates like

1766
00:48:31,660 --> 00:48:32,790
they're not going to listen to it anyway.

1767
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:36,160
The guy from fear factor.

1768
00:48:36,161 --> 00:48:36,970
I love that show.

1769
00:48:36,970 --> 00:48:37,511
Did you know that?

1770
00:48:37,511 --> 00:48:40,420
I mean is the female
Hyena actually fake penis?

1771
00:48:41,220 --> 00:48:42,350
They have a pho penis,

1772
00:48:42,380 --> 00:48:46,510
doesn't it all start as a vagina and
then it grows into a vignette like China.

1773
00:48:46,540 --> 00:48:48,520
The wrestler has like a giant sort of,

1774
00:48:48,730 --> 00:48:50,200
what you're saying is very similar.

1775
00:48:50,201 --> 00:48:52,670
We all what it is is we
all start out as females.

1776
00:48:53,230 --> 00:48:54,030
Human beings do it.

1777
00:48:54,030 --> 00:48:54,161
Yeah.

1778
00:48:54,161 --> 00:48:55,180
That's why men have nipples.

1779
00:48:56,140 --> 00:48:56,790
Right.

1780
00:48:56,790 --> 00:48:57,623
Um,

1781
00:48:57,790 --> 00:48:58,623
I just,

1782
00:48:59,090 --> 00:49:02,410
I had another point before we start
talking about eight clutter clutter.

1783
00:49:02,411 --> 00:49:03,970
I were talking about hyenas.

1784
00:49:04,030 --> 00:49:04,780
No we were not.

1785
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:07,500
You were talking about drowsy.

1786
00:49:08,110 --> 00:49:08,943
You made it weird.

1787
00:49:09,020 --> 00:49:12,080
Won't say Rhonda would grow at giant
fake dig if she's around you just to

1788
00:49:12,081 --> 00:49:12,820
dominate you.

1789
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:13,360
Okay.

1790
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:16,420
I just want to meet her cause I think
we'd be like best friends and I just want

1791
00:49:16,421 --> 00:49:19,720
to like maybe like train with her one
day but not have anyone touch me at the

1792
00:49:19,721 --> 00:49:20,170
same time.

1793
00:49:20,170 --> 00:49:21,190
But she would show you some moves.

1794
00:49:21,191 --> 00:49:22,330
You wouldn't roll with her.

1795
00:49:22,331 --> 00:49:23,290
But she moves.

1796
00:49:23,850 --> 00:49:25,380
She's so cool.

1797
00:49:25,750 --> 00:49:26,830
Well I'm glad you love her.

1798
00:49:27,690 --> 00:49:28,000
You know,

1799
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,250
she's a really unique person.

1800
00:49:29,260 --> 00:49:33,010
It's like Dana White and I were having
this conversation once and he was like,

1801
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:34,690
she's just a once in a lifetime person.

1802
00:49:34,691 --> 00:49:35,320
I said,

1803
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:35,921
no,

1804
00:49:35,921 --> 00:49:37,090
I go more than that.

1805
00:49:37,091 --> 00:49:37,361
I go,

1806
00:49:37,361 --> 00:49:38,530
she's a once ever.

1807
00:49:38,710 --> 00:49:38,951
I go,

1808
00:49:38,951 --> 00:49:41,320
there's never would think about how
many lifetimes people have lived.

1809
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:43,570
What's the other Ronda
Rousey's you can bring it up.

1810
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:47,170
So if I were a girl that if I were a fire,

1811
00:49:47,230 --> 00:49:48,720
if I did like ultimate fighting like her,

1812
00:49:48,730 --> 00:49:50,200
I would be scared shitless.

1813
00:49:50,201 --> 00:49:51,730
She just dominates consistently.

1814
00:49:51,731 --> 00:49:52,900
She doesn't lose.

1815
00:49:53,170 --> 00:49:56,860
And I looked at a picture on her Instagram
and it's who she fighting a fight

1816
00:49:56,861 --> 00:49:58,540
coming up in like in May and let us Davis.

1817
00:49:58,650 --> 00:49:58,930
Yeah,

1818
00:49:58,930 --> 00:50:00,130
and like the picture like Rhonda,

1819
00:50:00,131 --> 00:50:02,830
obviously it's like she's a star now and
she's got like a makeup team and her,

1820
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:04,960
she's got her heavyweight
belt and her hair is done.

1821
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:07,630
The other girls didn't like a
sports bra from like a big five,

1822
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:11,170
like no team around her,

1823
00:50:11,171 --> 00:50:12,004
no lighting.

1824
00:50:12,460 --> 00:50:13,720
She does have a theme.

1825
00:50:13,810 --> 00:50:15,340
Davis is a very talented fighter.

1826
00:50:15,341 --> 00:50:16,151
She's really good.

1827
00:50:16,151 --> 00:50:16,940
It's a good fight.

1828
00:50:16,940 --> 00:50:17,773
I beat my Rhonda.

1829
00:50:17,860 --> 00:50:21,040
I liked to fight though because Davis
has a black belt in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.

1830
00:50:21,041 --> 00:50:22,360
She's got real good Moy Tai,

1831
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:23,290
great leg kicks.

1832
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:24,620
She's very technically sound,

1833
00:50:24,630 --> 00:50:25,463
say all of us,

1834
00:50:25,660 --> 00:50:26,980
but Rhonda has just,

1835
00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:28,640
she's such a fucking beast.

1836
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:29,270
She's,

1837
00:50:29,270 --> 00:50:32,240
she's a weird combination because
she's absolutely beautiful,

1838
00:50:32,390 --> 00:50:33,350
but she,

1839
00:50:33,740 --> 00:50:36,590
she's just so fucking physically dominant,

1840
00:50:36,620 --> 00:50:36,891
you know,

1841
00:50:36,891 --> 00:50:40,610
it's not just pretty but with
great technique and you know,

1842
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:42,200
wins but looks like a girl.

1843
00:50:42,201 --> 00:50:45,980
Like she's got this weird thing going
on where she like crosses back and forth

1844
00:50:45,981 --> 00:50:46,814
between,

1845
00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:47,181
you know,

1846
00:50:47,181 --> 00:50:48,500
like just like a werewolf,

1847
00:50:48,540 --> 00:50:48,711
you know,

1848
00:50:48,711 --> 00:50:53,711
she crosses back and forth between
like bad ass monster and hot chick.

1849
00:50:54,690 --> 00:50:55,480
Yeah.

1850
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:57,260
Thick neck but still pretty.

1851
00:50:57,980 --> 00:50:58,550
She's still,

1852
00:50:58,550 --> 00:50:59,450
she's able to do it.

1853
00:50:59,500 --> 00:50:59,870
She's,

1854
00:50:59,870 --> 00:51:00,250
she's,

1855
00:51:00,250 --> 00:51:01,083
she pulls it off.

1856
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:01,880
I've got nothing.

1857
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:05,060
Even if it hasn't been
bad decide wouldn't she,

1858
00:51:05,061 --> 00:51:08,240
she also owns who she is and she owns it.

1859
00:51:08,241 --> 00:51:08,481
Hook,

1860
00:51:08,481 --> 00:51:09,320
line and sinker.

1861
00:51:09,321 --> 00:51:10,310
Like this is who it is.

1862
00:51:10,311 --> 00:51:11,450
Take it or go fuck yourself.

1863
00:51:11,470 --> 00:51:12,680
Well I think she is also,

1864
00:51:12,681 --> 00:51:16,130
I mean she gets to play herself
and movies like she's going to be,

1865
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:17,510
what's the movie she spendable?

1866
00:51:17,511 --> 00:51:18,171
Spendable is like,

1867
00:51:18,171 --> 00:51:19,010
she's a fighter and these,

1868
00:51:19,011 --> 00:51:19,131
you know,

1869
00:51:19,131 --> 00:51:21,440
they're not asking her to play like
she's not in a romantic comedy.

1870
00:51:21,810 --> 00:51:25,940
She's been given the blessing of getting
to be herself in her career so early on

1871
00:51:25,941 --> 00:51:27,920
versus trying to be something else.

1872
00:51:27,940 --> 00:51:28,141
Well,

1873
00:51:28,141 --> 00:51:29,840
she has a very unique mother.

1874
00:51:29,841 --> 00:51:32,480
Her mother was one of the
very first medalists in,

1875
00:51:32,481 --> 00:51:32,910
in,

1876
00:51:32,910 --> 00:51:37,220
in judo and she was a world
championship level judo player.

1877
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:39,080
Her mom was exactly the same.

1878
00:51:39,770 --> 00:51:40,603
Her family,

1879
00:51:40,710 --> 00:51:41,241
your family.

1880
00:51:41,241 --> 00:51:42,074
So her,

1881
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:44,030
her mom is a very unique woman.

1882
00:51:44,031 --> 00:51:44,391
Really,

1883
00:51:44,391 --> 00:51:44,720
really into,

1884
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:46,580
I want to get her on the
podcast and I will eventually,

1885
00:51:46,581 --> 00:51:47,660
but her mom is brilliant.

1886
00:51:47,870 --> 00:51:48,381
I've really,

1887
00:51:48,381 --> 00:51:51,710
really intelligent and he
just developed her daughter,

1888
00:51:51,740 --> 00:51:52,100
you know,

1889
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:54,560
early on like she would wake her up
in the middle of night and make her do

1890
00:51:54,660 --> 00:51:55,400
armbars.

1891
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:56,450
She's just like wake her up,

1892
00:51:56,451 --> 00:51:58,340
get on top of her and
make Rhonda hit an Armbar.

1893
00:51:59,590 --> 00:52:00,950
I created a monster.

1894
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:01,161
Yeah,

1895
00:52:01,161 --> 00:52:01,994
she did.

1896
00:52:02,150 --> 00:52:03,290
But an awesome monster.

1897
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:04,470
Yeah.

1898
00:52:04,470 --> 00:52:06,230
I enjoy that chick personnel.

1899
00:52:06,870 --> 00:52:07,581
We can be best friends.

1900
00:52:07,581 --> 00:52:08,370
When I get French fries,

1901
00:52:08,370 --> 00:52:08,840
I'll,

1902
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:09,740
I'll hook you guys up.

1903
00:52:09,741 --> 00:52:12,670
I'll get the phone numbers
together and make it happen.

1904
00:52:12,730 --> 00:52:13,563
Me,

1905
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:16,160
Brian Collins matter and
he said I can meet her.

1906
00:52:16,490 --> 00:52:17,031
You met her.

1907
00:52:17,031 --> 00:52:17,420
That's it.

1908
00:52:17,420 --> 00:52:19,010
Those are my only friends that come on.

1909
00:52:19,011 --> 00:52:19,880
We can make it real.

1910
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:20,781
I really want to meet her.

1911
00:52:20,781 --> 00:52:21,370
Okay.

1912
00:52:21,370 --> 00:52:23,180
I will make you meet
her and arm wrestle her.

1913
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:23,631
No,

1914
00:52:23,631 --> 00:52:24,464
you don't want that.

1915
00:52:24,950 --> 00:52:25,731
I'll show you when we leave.

1916
00:52:25,731 --> 00:52:27,110
I mean anything competitive with her.

1917
00:52:27,350 --> 00:52:28,970
Just how do we both do standups.

1918
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:29,870
He fucking wins.

1919
00:52:29,871 --> 00:52:30,201
Rhonda.

1920
00:52:30,201 --> 00:52:31,034
She's good.

1921
00:52:31,070 --> 00:52:32,090
She probably is.

1922
00:52:32,910 --> 00:52:36,440
She's probably one of those that's like
everything she like bake a pie wall.

1923
00:52:39,060 --> 00:52:41,030
Don't style opening the door.

1924
00:52:41,470 --> 00:52:42,303
Oven door.

1925
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:45,440
Could you imagine if she got on stage
and fucking kill that would really

1926
00:52:45,470 --> 00:52:46,101
devastate,

1927
00:52:46,101 --> 00:52:46,881
you know,

1928
00:52:46,881 --> 00:52:48,110
just one home and write jokes?

1929
00:52:48,130 --> 00:52:48,410
I would,

1930
00:52:48,410 --> 00:52:48,880
no.

1931
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:50,810
I would know because I would,

1932
00:52:50,870 --> 00:52:51,703
I would just be like,

1933
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:54,500
I would solidify my desire
to be best friends with her.

1934
00:52:55,580 --> 00:52:57,440
If you were on an island together,

1935
00:52:57,441 --> 00:52:58,700
do you think you'd go lesbian with her?

1936
00:52:58,730 --> 00:52:58,820
No.

1937
00:52:58,820 --> 00:52:59,653
She would eat me,

1938
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:02,473
eat my face,

1939
00:53:03,340 --> 00:53:05,150
and she would pick my teeth with her arms.

1940
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:06,640
What if you were like a,

1941
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:06,950
you know,

1942
00:53:06,950 --> 00:53:08,660
an island with a lot of good food?

1943
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:10,040
A lot of fish.

1944
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:10,341
First of all,

1945
00:53:10,341 --> 00:53:10,941
I'm not a dude,

1946
00:53:10,941 --> 00:53:14,120
so my desire to fuck is
not as intense as a man's.

1947
00:53:14,180 --> 00:53:14,901
My thing would be like,

1948
00:53:14,901 --> 00:53:17,600
I need to stay alive and eat versus like,

1949
00:53:17,630 --> 00:53:17,751
oh,

1950
00:53:17,751 --> 00:53:18,950
I got to fuck someone.

1951
00:53:18,951 --> 00:53:19,310
Hey,

1952
00:53:19,310 --> 00:53:20,180
other woman,

1953
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:22,140
let's do it now.

1954
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:23,313
I would not.

1955
00:53:23,340 --> 00:53:24,600
But you would like to opinion ship.

1956
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:26,010
At least I think the

1957
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:27,690
desire would become an family.

1958
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:28,793
No,

1959
00:53:28,890 --> 00:53:30,720
but the desire to like be touched.

1960
00:53:30,721 --> 00:53:31,830
It's very universal,

1961
00:53:31,890 --> 00:53:32,723
right?

1962
00:53:32,820 --> 00:53:33,840
It's so universal.

1963
00:53:33,870 --> 00:53:35,550
I definitely,

1964
00:53:36,060 --> 00:53:36,810
yeah,

1965
00:53:36,810 --> 00:53:37,220
it,

1966
00:53:37,220 --> 00:53:37,650
yes.

1967
00:53:37,650 --> 00:53:38,640
I was thinking about it this weekend.

1968
00:53:38,670 --> 00:53:41,530
I definitely made someone give
me a back rub quite in backrub.

1969
00:53:41,750 --> 00:53:43,380
It will also just a hug.

1970
00:53:43,650 --> 00:53:45,930
Just someone giving you a hug if
you haven't been hugged in a while.

1971
00:53:45,990 --> 00:53:46,860
However,

1972
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:48,030
to the guys listening,

1973
00:53:48,570 --> 00:53:50,040
don't hug girls that
don't want to be hugged.

1974
00:53:50,041 --> 00:53:50,310
Yeah,

1975
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:50,821
don't do that.

1976
00:53:50,821 --> 00:53:51,440
That's creepy.

1977
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:51,950
Yeah.

1978
00:53:51,950 --> 00:53:52,080
Well,

1979
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:54,510
especially girls because
a guy hugging a girl,

1980
00:53:54,511 --> 00:53:55,344
it's such an,

1981
00:53:56,610 --> 00:53:59,140
it's a risky scenario for the girl on,

1982
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:00,451
well not always,

1983
00:54:00,451 --> 00:54:01,560
but the pot,

1984
00:54:01,770 --> 00:54:05,580
the potential is there and it's just a
risky scenario that you're going to let

1985
00:54:05,581 --> 00:54:07,500
this guy hold your body.

1986
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:09,150
And then also it's like,

1987
00:54:09,510 --> 00:54:11,460
then it escalates with a lot of people.

1988
00:54:11,461 --> 00:54:13,820
Then it moves to like creepier
and creepier and creepier is,

1989
00:54:13,890 --> 00:54:15,030
some guys can give you a hug,

1990
00:54:15,031 --> 00:54:15,301
right?

1991
00:54:15,301 --> 00:54:16,260
And it's just a hug like,

1992
00:54:16,261 --> 00:54:16,801
Hey Eliza,

1993
00:54:16,801 --> 00:54:17,490
what's up?

1994
00:54:17,490 --> 00:54:18,540
I hope that I'm that guy.

1995
00:54:18,541 --> 00:54:20,120
I give you hugs and you
don't get any weirder.

1996
00:54:20,130 --> 00:54:21,360
Like he's trying to get
hugged number three.

1997
00:54:21,361 --> 00:54:23,420
Now he's trying to rob
his crotch or grounds.

1998
00:54:25,020 --> 00:54:26,190
But there are guys like that,

1999
00:54:26,191 --> 00:54:26,461
right?

2000
00:54:26,461 --> 00:54:27,050
Sure.

2001
00:54:27,050 --> 00:54:29,520
I can get that first hug and then after,

2002
00:54:29,580 --> 00:54:30,240
well,

2003
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:30,930
uh,

2004
00:54:30,930 --> 00:54:31,830
I get a lot of like,

2005
00:54:31,831 --> 00:54:33,570
comics will come up that I don't know,

2006
00:54:33,571 --> 00:54:34,950
but they think we know each other,

2007
00:54:34,951 --> 00:54:35,371
which is,

2008
00:54:35,371 --> 00:54:35,760
look,

2009
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:37,470
I'm not famous and I'm not a dick,

2010
00:54:37,471 --> 00:54:39,210
but like just cause I
did one show with you.

2011
00:54:39,330 --> 00:54:39,660
Right?

2012
00:54:39,660 --> 00:54:41,780
Like ever or just cause I've seen you
at the comedy store in they come to be

2013
00:54:41,781 --> 00:54:42,540
like what up sweetheart?

2014
00:54:42,540 --> 00:54:43,530
And they give you a hug and you're like,

2015
00:54:43,620 --> 00:54:44,220
ugh.

2016
00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:45,360
Like I don't want to hug you.

2017
00:54:45,361 --> 00:54:48,450
Like I don't want to get a physical
connection with you fucking I don't,

2018
00:54:48,540 --> 00:54:49,373
I don't know you.

2019
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:52,050
My thing is after shows and
this is always wearing me out.

2020
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:53,281
I've had definitely,

2021
00:54:53,281 --> 00:54:55,350
I've got all kinds of fans,

2022
00:54:55,351 --> 00:54:56,131
a lot of creepy ones,

2023
00:54:56,131 --> 00:54:56,791
a lot of lonely ones.

2024
00:54:56,791 --> 00:54:58,440
Everybody's super cool.

2025
00:54:58,620 --> 00:55:02,100
I've never had an issue with a male fan
being aggressive even if they're like

2026
00:55:02,101 --> 00:55:02,934
wasted.

2027
00:55:03,150 --> 00:55:06,810
But I've definitely had girls that
get out of control like Lesbos style.

2028
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:07,291
Like I had a girl,

2029
00:55:07,291 --> 00:55:08,400
she kept kissing my face.

2030
00:55:08,730 --> 00:55:12,150
Like she kept kissing my cheek and
like a security guide intervene.

2031
00:55:12,151 --> 00:55:16,110
Like I could definitely take care of
myself cause she wasn't Ronda Rousey but

2032
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:19,770
it's always weird like girls step over
that line more than guys do but they

2033
00:55:19,771 --> 00:55:20,700
definitely like touch you.

2034
00:55:20,701 --> 00:55:23,370
We're like on your side and they want
to see like are you fat under that t

2035
00:55:23,371 --> 00:55:23,701
shirt?

2036
00:55:23,701 --> 00:55:24,750
Like girls do that guys,

2037
00:55:24,751 --> 00:55:25,584
you had to like there's,

2038
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:26,640
when you take a picture,

2039
00:55:26,850 --> 00:55:29,700
they put their arm around your waist and
I'm just like hyper aware of the fact

2040
00:55:29,701 --> 00:55:33,510
that there is a very thin
fabric separating like my
naked body from this guy's

2041
00:55:33,511 --> 00:55:35,940
hand and you're wondering when is
he going to go back and be like,

2042
00:55:35,941 --> 00:55:36,181
oh yeah,

2043
00:55:36,181 --> 00:55:37,530
she wasn't as fit as I thought.

2044
00:55:37,531 --> 00:55:38,910
She'd be like,

2045
00:55:38,911 --> 00:55:41,280
you just all these thoughts and meanwhile
they're just drunk and like I gotta

2046
00:55:41,281 --> 00:55:41,860
get Outta here.

2047
00:55:41,860 --> 00:55:42,550
But,

2048
00:55:42,550 --> 00:55:45,640
but you attach all these things
to it course touching my body.

2049
00:55:45,670 --> 00:55:46,900
There's a weird thing where you,

2050
00:55:46,930 --> 00:55:48,190
where people hug girls.

2051
00:55:48,220 --> 00:55:50,470
Like hugging a girl is
like pretty standard.

2052
00:55:50,530 --> 00:55:50,801
You know,

2053
00:55:50,801 --> 00:55:52,090
if you know a girl and you see her like,

2054
00:55:52,091 --> 00:55:52,271
Hey,

2055
00:55:52,271 --> 00:55:52,571
what's up?

2056
00:55:52,571 --> 00:55:53,020
You hugging it.

2057
00:55:53,020 --> 00:55:55,870
Whereas like if as a dude
that I knew the same amount,

2058
00:55:55,871 --> 00:55:56,950
I wouldn't shake his hand,

2059
00:55:57,370 --> 00:55:59,440
but you'd hug like you're
a good guy friends.

2060
00:55:59,441 --> 00:55:59,960
Oh yeah,

2061
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:00,310
yeah.

2062
00:56:00,310 --> 00:56:01,390
I have all my friends.

2063
00:56:01,750 --> 00:56:02,583
I hugged every life.

2064
00:56:02,590 --> 00:56:03,550
If I see Joey Diaz,

2065
00:56:03,551 --> 00:56:03,911
I hug him.

2066
00:56:03,911 --> 00:56:04,744
Every time I see him

2067
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:05,830
there's a,

2068
00:56:05,830 --> 00:56:06,910
there's a certain line you cross.

2069
00:56:06,911 --> 00:56:08,140
And then once you become huggers,

2070
00:56:08,141 --> 00:56:09,240
you must maintain hugging.

2071
00:56:09,241 --> 00:56:09,611
Yeah.

2072
00:56:09,611 --> 00:56:10,450
You can't like hug,

2073
00:56:10,451 --> 00:56:10,721
hug,

2074
00:56:10,721 --> 00:56:11,021
hug.

2075
00:56:11,021 --> 00:56:11,440
Hey,

2076
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:13,240
nice to meet you and shake
your hand or nice to see.

2077
00:56:13,241 --> 00:56:13,660
Yeah.

2078
00:56:13,660 --> 00:56:15,460
I'm not a big hugger with some of my,

2079
00:56:15,610 --> 00:56:19,060
most with my closest girlfriends we
don't hug cause we're just not like that.

2080
00:56:19,270 --> 00:56:22,330
I tend to hug girls that I know less
because it lets them know like look,

2081
00:56:22,331 --> 00:56:22,661
I'm a girl.

2082
00:56:22,661 --> 00:56:23,940
Like right.

2083
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:24,851
Yeah,

2084
00:56:24,851 --> 00:56:25,511
I know what you mean.

2085
00:56:25,511 --> 00:56:26,021
I know what you mean.

2086
00:56:26,021 --> 00:56:31,021
Like you're almost like like throwing up
a flag of peace and friendship and it's

2087
00:56:32,111 --> 00:56:33,190
also a good way like,

2088
00:56:33,310 --> 00:56:33,581
I don't know,

2089
00:56:33,581 --> 00:56:35,380
to break the ice after if
you go to like a party,

2090
00:56:35,381 --> 00:56:36,460
like it was nice meeting you.

2091
00:56:36,490 --> 00:56:36,761
Right,

2092
00:56:36,761 --> 00:56:37,001
right,

2093
00:56:37,001 --> 00:56:37,834
right.

2094
00:56:37,870 --> 00:56:39,430
It's just a human thing to do.

2095
00:56:39,550 --> 00:56:40,960
Like to solidify that the,

2096
00:56:40,961 --> 00:56:45,520
it was a fun sort of like put a cap
on it that it was a good interaction.

2097
00:56:45,930 --> 00:56:49,090
But I've definitely done like this
weird autism thing where like all hug,

2098
00:56:49,091 --> 00:56:51,250
like three of the four people
in the forest one just be like,

2099
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:53,351
I do that too.

2100
00:56:53,351 --> 00:56:55,420
If I don't know the other person
where sometimes they'll go,

2101
00:56:55,421 --> 00:56:55,751
come on,

2102
00:56:55,751 --> 00:56:56,231
bring it in.

2103
00:56:56,231 --> 00:56:57,850
Let's all hug group hug.

2104
00:56:58,500 --> 00:56:59,081
Really what I'm,

2105
00:56:59,081 --> 00:56:59,950
the subtext is like,

2106
00:56:59,951 --> 00:57:00,850
I just gotta get Outta here,

2107
00:57:00,851 --> 00:57:02,080
so please don't think I'm going goodbye.

2108
00:57:02,140 --> 00:57:02,591
Right.

2109
00:57:02,591 --> 00:57:04,240
So what did that one person,

2110
00:57:04,241 --> 00:57:05,021
that shit will haunt them?

2111
00:57:05,021 --> 00:57:06,370
Like you stumbling on a joke,

2112
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:08,060
a fourth person that you didn't hug.

2113
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:09,260
What the fuck do I fucking,

2114
00:57:09,270 --> 00:57:10,103
Shit.

2115
00:57:10,150 --> 00:57:11,210
I was listening to this thing.

2116
00:57:11,211 --> 00:57:14,050
It was a talk once that
this guy was giving about,

2117
00:57:14,051 --> 00:57:14,800
um,

2118
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:15,041
uh,

2119
00:57:15,041 --> 00:57:18,490
all sorts of different psychological
disorders in one of them was a theory that

2120
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:20,800
they had had at one point
in time about schizophrenia,

2121
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:22,240
schizophrenia being,

2122
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:23,113
um,

2123
00:57:23,710 --> 00:57:25,600
having something to do with smells.

2124
00:57:25,930 --> 00:57:27,710
And that will,

2125
00:57:28,110 --> 00:57:29,380
that you give off certain,

2126
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:33,880
that it's a form for mono will issue that
you give off a certain smell and then

2127
00:57:33,881 --> 00:57:36,670
people respond to that smell and they go,

2128
00:57:36,671 --> 00:57:36,821
oh,

2129
00:57:36,821 --> 00:57:37,720
this guy's weird.

2130
00:57:37,750 --> 00:57:38,680
And then you go,

2131
00:57:38,681 --> 00:57:39,101
wow,

2132
00:57:39,101 --> 00:57:40,090
I'm fucking weird.

2133
00:57:40,091 --> 00:57:43,180
And then it starts this chain
reaction that makes you weird,

2134
00:57:43,780 --> 00:57:47,170
that makes you yourself
pheromones upset someone else.

2135
00:57:47,190 --> 00:57:47,480
Yeah.

2136
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:48,010
Because you're,

2137
00:57:48,010 --> 00:57:52,690
your reality becomes defined by people
avoiding you and freaking out by you and

2138
00:57:52,691 --> 00:57:54,120
you can get kind of crazy because of that.

2139
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:55,600
It sounds like you need to be sensitive,

2140
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:57,250
right people and even be
more secure in who they are.

2141
00:57:57,800 --> 00:57:58,091
Whoa,

2142
00:57:58,091 --> 00:57:58,750
look at you.

2143
00:57:58,750 --> 00:57:59,583
Fucking take that.

2144
00:57:59,830 --> 00:57:59,981
Hey,

2145
00:57:59,981 --> 00:58:00,460
we all,

2146
00:58:00,460 --> 00:58:01,920
we all start from different places.

2147
00:58:01,940 --> 00:58:04,900
Allows us this last year some people had
shitty homes without organized parents

2148
00:58:04,901 --> 00:58:05,734
like you.

2149
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:06,940
I fair enough.

2150
00:58:07,210 --> 00:58:08,110
I think the schizophrenia,

2151
00:58:08,111 --> 00:58:09,700
I think the pheromone thing is huge.

2152
00:58:10,110 --> 00:58:10,871
I have dated,

2153
00:58:10,871 --> 00:58:12,100
I remember dating someone,

2154
00:58:12,490 --> 00:58:13,840
we didn't really have anything in common,

2155
00:58:13,841 --> 00:58:18,841
but we couldn't stop smelling each other
well went to a bar and I just buried my

2156
00:58:19,091 --> 00:58:21,160
face in his neck and I just like,

2157
00:58:21,161 --> 00:58:21,701
I can't stop.

2158
00:58:21,701 --> 00:58:22,480
There was something,

2159
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:24,670
some people just smell
like home for some reason.

2160
00:58:25,030 --> 00:58:25,841
Not necessarily your home,

2161
00:58:25,841 --> 00:58:27,610
but like you get a very
comfortable feeling.

2162
00:58:27,970 --> 00:58:30,160
He's turned out to be a nightmare.

2163
00:58:30,190 --> 00:58:32,770
But on a fairly low level.

2164
00:58:33,190 --> 00:58:35,290
It was so he was a nightmare.

2165
00:58:35,590 --> 00:58:37,240
A nightmare psychologically.

2166
00:58:37,390 --> 00:58:38,021
I mean it was,

2167
00:58:38,021 --> 00:58:39,400
we just didn't work out and that's fine.

2168
00:58:39,430 --> 00:58:41,200
But I remember just sitting
there and I was just like,

2169
00:58:41,201 --> 00:58:42,640
I cannot stop doing this.

2170
00:58:42,700 --> 00:58:45,070
Was He the nightmare where you uh,

2171
00:58:45,071 --> 00:58:45,851
we'll talk about off the air.

2172
00:58:45,851 --> 00:58:46,684
It was definitely,

2173
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:47,740
it's definitely not me.

2174
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:50,380
I don't want to say what it was because
I wasn't listening to happens to know

2175
00:58:50,381 --> 00:58:50,830
when we'll be like,

2176
00:58:50,830 --> 00:58:51,520
I know,

2177
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:52,660
but it was right,

2178
00:58:52,661 --> 00:58:52,860
right.

2179
00:58:52,860 --> 00:58:53,050
Well,

2180
00:58:53,050 --> 00:58:55,480
I will share with you a story if
you want to hear these please,

2181
00:58:55,990 --> 00:58:56,940
because this is really everything.

2182
00:58:56,950 --> 00:59:00,200
And I shared this for the first time in
Tampa this weekend and I hadn't told the

2183
00:59:00,201 --> 00:59:01,450
to scoot on up to the microphone,

2184
00:59:01,490 --> 00:59:02,323
let us know.

2185
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:03,873
Um,

2186
00:59:05,050 --> 00:59:05,261
I,

2187
00:59:05,261 --> 00:59:06,700
this is just a crazy night
wearing the headphones.

2188
00:59:06,701 --> 00:59:07,690
That's why I'm letting people know,

2189
00:59:07,691 --> 00:59:08,524
like you,

2190
00:59:08,790 --> 00:59:09,670
when you move away,

2191
00:59:09,671 --> 00:59:11,350
left into the right of these things,

2192
00:59:11,351 --> 00:59:12,550
it changes the volume.

2193
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:14,590
Do you think it really matters
if you put it left or right?

2194
00:59:14,650 --> 00:59:15,100
No,

2195
00:59:15,100 --> 00:59:15,933
that doesn't matter.

2196
00:59:17,410 --> 00:59:20,050
But if we look at for blanche
that was looking for the volume,

2197
00:59:20,110 --> 00:59:20,900
it's up here.

2198
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:21,320
Oh,

2199
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:21,890
that's fine.

2200
00:59:21,890 --> 00:59:23,170
Next to this assault.

2201
00:59:23,570 --> 00:59:24,560
That is a salt rock.

2202
00:59:24,580 --> 00:59:24,900
Yeah.

2203
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:25,850
People like were hippies.

2204
00:59:25,851 --> 00:59:26,900
Here we have,

2205
00:59:26,901 --> 00:59:27,320
um,

2206
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:27,650
look,

2207
00:59:27,650 --> 00:59:29,090
I have a lava lamps.

2208
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:30,913
Salt rocks.

2209
00:59:31,130 --> 00:59:31,490
Yeah.

2210
00:59:31,490 --> 00:59:32,323
Jimi Hendrix.

2211
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:35,090
I couldn't eat looking
at the Predator thing.

2212
00:59:35,300 --> 00:59:37,370
I had a sandwich or won't be
able to look at that and eat.

2213
00:59:37,430 --> 00:59:38,263
It grosses me out.

2214
00:59:38,750 --> 00:59:39,590
It's just a mask.

2215
00:59:39,650 --> 00:59:43,100
Halloween costumes grossed me out like
the smell of latex and like that's

2216
00:59:43,101 --> 00:59:43,940
actually hard.

2217
00:59:43,970 --> 00:59:44,631
That's like a,

2218
00:59:44,631 --> 00:59:46,820
a model that was made
by special effects guy.

2219
00:59:47,100 --> 00:59:48,650
It was looking at it cause he's so scary.

2220
00:59:48,651 --> 00:59:50,330
But like that thing couldn't eat you.

2221
00:59:51,020 --> 00:59:51,770
Uh,

2222
00:59:51,770 --> 00:59:53,200
you sure it could look a small mouth,

2223
00:59:53,230 --> 00:59:54,063
it would rip you apart.

2224
00:59:54,130 --> 00:59:54,620
Small mouth.

2225
00:59:54,620 --> 00:59:54,831
Yeah.

2226
00:59:54,831 --> 00:59:56,000
But it would chew chunks of you.

2227
00:59:56,060 --> 00:59:56,330
Let's,

2228
00:59:56,330 --> 00:59:59,210
and those other things act as
teeth to just pull some meat off.

2229
00:59:59,211 --> 00:59:59,800
Yeah.

2230
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:02,690
But it depends on how it can articulate
and just trying to make them human.

2231
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:04,640
I think he would appreciate that.

2232
01:00:05,090 --> 01:00:05,810
Okay.

2233
01:00:05,810 --> 01:00:05,991
Okay.

2234
01:00:05,991 --> 01:00:06,591
So here's my story.

2235
01:00:06,591 --> 01:00:07,424
I hear please.

2236
01:00:07,930 --> 01:00:09,190
We were talking about
relationship the beginning.

2237
01:00:09,340 --> 01:00:13,960
So I went through a breakup
like a month and a half ago,

2238
01:00:13,990 --> 01:00:14,830
maybe two months ago.

2239
01:00:16,180 --> 01:00:18,640
I feel like you'll have you of all people
will appreciate this story and I'll

2240
01:00:18,641 --> 01:00:19,750
give you the abridged version.

2241
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:20,720
Um,

2242
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:21,730
give me the juicy details.

2243
01:00:21,790 --> 01:00:24,670
So basically I met this guy a year,

2244
01:00:24,940 --> 01:00:25,630
two years,

2245
01:00:25,630 --> 01:00:26,351
not this thanksgiving,

2246
01:00:26,351 --> 01:00:28,210
the last one on the plane.

2247
01:00:28,660 --> 01:00:33,660
And we hit it off and he told me his
name and he said he went to Yale and he

2248
01:00:35,590 --> 01:00:36,430
worked in,

2249
01:00:36,460 --> 01:00:36,761
we'll say,

2250
01:00:36,761 --> 01:00:37,690
well he worked in finances,

2251
01:00:37,691 --> 01:00:38,524
we'll just leave it at that.

2252
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:40,180
And so I knew him for a year,

2253
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:41,590
never wanted to date him.

2254
01:00:41,860 --> 01:00:43,840
And eventually we dated,

2255
01:00:44,110 --> 01:00:47,560
we dated for for three months and
during the time we were dating,

2256
01:00:47,890 --> 01:00:48,700
um,

2257
01:00:48,700 --> 01:00:49,660
before we'd started dating,

2258
01:00:49,661 --> 01:00:52,510
he told me he bought a house and I
never wanted to see the house because I

2259
01:00:52,990 --> 01:00:53,281
whatever,

2260
01:00:53,281 --> 01:00:53,891
it wasn't dating him,

2261
01:00:53,891 --> 01:00:54,724
I didn't care.

2262
01:00:54,730 --> 01:00:56,770
So we start dating and the
whole time we're dating,

2263
01:00:56,771 --> 01:00:58,150
things start getting weird.

2264
01:00:58,570 --> 01:01:00,580
Like we get along perfectly.

2265
01:01:00,581 --> 01:01:03,970
But there are certain aspects of his
personal life that are like not checking

2266
01:01:03,971 --> 01:01:04,804
out.

2267
01:01:05,050 --> 01:01:07,150
Like I told my mom,

2268
01:01:07,151 --> 01:01:07,481
I was like,

2269
01:01:07,481 --> 01:01:07,870
Oh hey,

2270
01:01:07,870 --> 01:01:09,430
this is his name and
this is where he works.

2271
01:01:09,431 --> 01:01:11,320
So she googled him because
that's what moms do,

2272
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:11,890
right.

2273
01:01:11,890 --> 01:01:15,490
And his work bio says
that he graduated from uh,

2274
01:01:15,580 --> 01:01:17,050
from a different college,

2275
01:01:17,051 --> 01:01:18,100
not he's anyone to Yale,

2276
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:18,790
right.

2277
01:01:18,790 --> 01:01:19,780
Is that he'd graduates around.

2278
01:01:19,781 --> 01:01:20,291
So I call him,

2279
01:01:20,291 --> 01:01:20,501
I'm like,

2280
01:01:20,501 --> 01:01:21,101
why does it say that?

2281
01:01:21,101 --> 01:01:21,341
He's like,

2282
01:01:21,341 --> 01:01:22,174
Oh my God,

2283
01:01:22,300 --> 01:01:24,100
they've cut and pasted the wrong bio.

2284
01:01:24,101 --> 01:01:24,701
It's a mess up.

2285
01:01:24,701 --> 01:01:25,491
My company's a mess.

2286
01:01:25,491 --> 01:01:26,081
I'm like okay,

2287
01:01:26,081 --> 01:01:27,370
I get wrong buyers all the time.

2288
01:01:27,371 --> 01:01:28,270
Like I totally get it.

2289
01:01:28,620 --> 01:01:28,931
And I was like,

2290
01:01:28,931 --> 01:01:29,890
I want to send you a present,

2291
01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:30,880
what's your address?

2292
01:01:31,250 --> 01:01:31,570
And he's like,

2293
01:01:31,570 --> 01:01:32,590
oh just send it to my work.

2294
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:33,461
And I was like,

2295
01:01:33,461 --> 01:01:33,611
no,

2296
01:01:33,611 --> 01:01:34,600
I want to send it to your house.

2297
01:01:35,080 --> 01:01:36,220
So he gives me this address.

2298
01:01:36,250 --> 01:01:37,930
So I sent him a gift and he gets it.

2299
01:01:38,230 --> 01:01:40,780
And then one day I'm out with my friend
Laura and we're at lunch and we start to

2300
01:01:40,781 --> 01:01:44,980
build a case about why we think this
guy is a liar as a joke at first cause

2301
01:01:44,981 --> 01:01:45,820
nothing's checking out.

2302
01:01:46,090 --> 01:01:46,661
So Laura's like,

2303
01:01:46,661 --> 01:01:47,680
let's drive by his house.

2304
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:50,620
And I remember what the house looked
like from the picture he'd sent me,

2305
01:01:50,621 --> 01:01:52,360
cause like six months
before we were dating,

2306
01:01:52,560 --> 01:01:52,841
he was like,

2307
01:01:52,841 --> 01:01:53,860
check out this house that I bought.

2308
01:01:54,340 --> 01:01:55,990
So I go to the house and it's not a house,

2309
01:01:55,991 --> 01:01:56,824
it's an apartment.

2310
01:01:57,340 --> 01:02:00,700
And Laura goes up to the door and she's
like looking in and all of a sudden the

2311
01:02:00,701 --> 01:02:03,100
girl opens the door and I'm just,

2312
01:02:03,550 --> 01:02:04,270
I'm just,

2313
01:02:04,270 --> 01:02:06,100
I was paralyzed and the girl looks at me,

2314
01:02:06,101 --> 01:02:06,934
she goes,

2315
01:02:06,970 --> 01:02:07,301
she was like,

2316
01:02:07,301 --> 01:02:07,421
hi,

2317
01:02:07,421 --> 01:02:08,110
can I help you guys?

2318
01:02:08,110 --> 01:02:08,381
And we're like,

2319
01:02:08,381 --> 01:02:08,501
oh,

2320
01:02:08,501 --> 01:02:11,020
we're just looking for
the guy we're looking for.

2321
01:02:11,021 --> 01:02:11,530
And she was like,

2322
01:02:11,530 --> 01:02:11,621
Oh,

2323
01:02:11,621 --> 01:02:12,371
you're a [inaudible].

2324
01:02:12,371 --> 01:02:12,731
And I was like,

2325
01:02:12,731 --> 01:02:14,410
how the fuck do you know who I am?

2326
01:02:14,750 --> 01:02:15,250
And she was like,

2327
01:02:15,250 --> 01:02:15,581
Oh,

2328
01:02:15,581 --> 01:02:16,510
I'm his roommate.

2329
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:17,833
And I was like,

2330
01:02:17,980 --> 01:02:18,431
okay,

2331
01:02:18,431 --> 01:02:19,320
well that's like,

2332
01:02:19,321 --> 01:02:20,250
I'm just not a cheating thing.

2333
01:02:20,251 --> 01:02:20,641
But I was like,

2334
01:02:20,641 --> 01:02:22,380
so I call him and I'm like,

2335
01:02:22,381 --> 01:02:23,041
why do you have a roommate?

2336
01:02:23,041 --> 01:02:23,461
And he goes,

2337
01:02:23,461 --> 01:02:24,190
well,

2338
01:02:24,190 --> 01:02:25,023
um,

2339
01:02:25,380 --> 01:02:28,650
my mom is sick and she moved to
La and she lives at my house.

2340
01:02:28,980 --> 01:02:29,970
And I,

2341
01:02:30,390 --> 01:02:30,511
I,

2342
01:02:30,511 --> 01:02:31,830
she lives there and I live with my friend.

2343
01:02:31,831 --> 01:02:33,750
To give my mom privacy and I was like,

2344
01:02:33,751 --> 01:02:34,021
all right,

2345
01:02:34,021 --> 01:02:34,651
well that's weird,

2346
01:02:34,651 --> 01:02:37,380
but like I still want
to know where you live.

2347
01:02:38,070 --> 01:02:38,540
Oh

2348
01:02:38,540 --> 01:02:38,841
God,

2349
01:02:38,841 --> 01:02:41,000
this guy should just change his
number and run away from you.

2350
01:02:41,050 --> 01:02:41,400
Okay,

2351
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:41,640
got it.

2352
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:42,160
Yeah.

2353
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:42,993
So,

2354
01:02:43,030 --> 01:02:43,271
okay.

2355
01:02:43,271 --> 01:02:43,991
So I was like,

2356
01:02:43,991 --> 01:02:44,171
all right,

2357
01:02:44,171 --> 01:02:46,720
so I let it go and when we're together,

2358
01:02:46,721 --> 01:02:47,470
everything's great.

2359
01:02:47,470 --> 01:02:48,280
Like perfect.

2360
01:02:48,280 --> 01:02:49,630
You're not thinking about it at all.

2361
01:02:49,750 --> 01:02:49,990
I,

2362
01:02:49,990 --> 01:02:50,890
well that part I was like,

2363
01:02:50,891 --> 01:02:51,724
okay,

2364
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,050
his mom has cancer.

2365
01:02:53,260 --> 01:02:54,093
That's what he told me.

2366
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:54,851
And he's like,

2367
01:02:54,851 --> 01:02:55,720
she's wants privacy.

2368
01:02:55,721 --> 01:02:56,021
So I'm like,

2369
01:02:56,021 --> 01:02:56,291
okay.

2370
01:02:56,291 --> 01:02:59,290
And I fell in love with him in the first
place because he told me she had cancer

2371
01:02:59,291 --> 01:02:59,891
and I got,

2372
01:02:59,891 --> 01:03:02,200
I wanted to take care of him and
like that really like tugged on my

2373
01:03:02,201 --> 01:03:03,034
heartstrings.

2374
01:03:03,540 --> 01:03:03,881
So I was like,

2375
01:03:03,881 --> 01:03:04,240
okay.

2376
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:07,330
I met them on once and every
single time after I met her once,

2377
01:03:07,331 --> 01:03:10,300
like the first week we started dating
and every time after that I'd be like,

2378
01:03:10,420 --> 01:03:10,900
let me take,

2379
01:03:10,900 --> 01:03:11,501
if you're at work,

2380
01:03:11,501 --> 01:03:11,830
I'm like,

2381
01:03:11,830 --> 01:03:12,371
I've got free time.

2382
01:03:12,371 --> 01:03:13,270
Let me take your mom to lunch.

2383
01:03:13,271 --> 01:03:14,290
Let me take your mom to the movies.

2384
01:03:14,291 --> 01:03:15,400
Can we go to like anything,

2385
01:03:15,580 --> 01:03:16,040
right.

2386
01:03:16,040 --> 01:03:17,110
Could never make it happen.

2387
01:03:17,410 --> 01:03:18,760
Let's go to brunch with your mom.

2388
01:03:18,761 --> 01:03:19,391
Let me do something.

2389
01:03:19,391 --> 01:03:20,290
Let me take her somewhere.

2390
01:03:20,340 --> 01:03:20,521
No.

2391
01:03:20,521 --> 01:03:21,450
When you met the mom,

2392
01:03:21,451 --> 01:03:23,730
did her illness ever
come up in conversation?

2393
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:23,970
No,

2394
01:03:23,970 --> 01:03:25,590
because I thought that would
be tactless for me to be like,

2395
01:03:25,591 --> 01:03:26,250
how's your cancer?

2396
01:03:26,250 --> 01:03:26,431
Well,

2397
01:03:26,431 --> 01:03:27,900
I mean if she brought it up,

2398
01:03:28,580 --> 01:03:29,160
never brought her up,

2399
01:03:29,160 --> 01:03:29,460
right?

2400
01:03:29,460 --> 01:03:29,641
No,

2401
01:03:29,641 --> 01:03:30,300
nothing.

2402
01:03:30,300 --> 01:03:31,530
They came with me to the craft store.

2403
01:03:31,531 --> 01:03:32,670
I had to buy stuff for Christmas party.

2404
01:03:33,180 --> 01:03:33,820
Um,

2405
01:03:33,820 --> 01:03:34,653
we didn't say much,

2406
01:03:35,110 --> 01:03:35,890
but I never,

2407
01:03:35,890 --> 01:03:37,390
so weeks are going by and I'm like,

2408
01:03:37,720 --> 01:03:38,411
I just want to hang out.

2409
01:03:38,411 --> 01:03:39,430
Like if you love me.

2410
01:03:39,431 --> 01:03:40,960
And he always talked
about getting married,

2411
01:03:40,961 --> 01:03:41,351
stuff like that.

2412
01:03:41,351 --> 01:03:41,501
I'm like,

2413
01:03:41,501 --> 01:03:43,360
I should probably meet
this woman more than once.

2414
01:03:44,500 --> 01:03:45,460
So he gives me,

2415
01:03:45,461 --> 01:03:46,630
so I go to that.

2416
01:03:46,631 --> 01:03:46,960
So it's not,

2417
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:47,793
so I call him and he's like,

2418
01:03:47,830 --> 01:03:48,280
uh,

2419
01:03:48,280 --> 01:03:49,300
my mom is living alone.

2420
01:03:49,301 --> 01:03:50,290
I intend to give her privacy.

2421
01:03:50,291 --> 01:03:50,591
And I was like,

2422
01:03:50,591 --> 01:03:50,741
okay,

2423
01:03:50,741 --> 01:03:51,574
that's fine,

2424
01:03:51,730 --> 01:03:53,140
but you need to tell me where you live.

2425
01:03:53,530 --> 01:03:53,860
Well,

2426
01:03:53,860 --> 01:03:54,820
you gave me that and I was like,

2427
01:03:54,821 --> 01:03:55,421
why are you being weird?

2428
01:03:55,421 --> 01:03:59,350
You gave me the address like six months
ago before we were dating and he was

2429
01:03:59,351 --> 01:04:00,184
like,

2430
01:04:00,460 --> 01:04:00,910
um,

2431
01:04:00,910 --> 01:04:01,600
I,

2432
01:04:01,600 --> 01:04:01,780
uh,

2433
01:04:01,780 --> 01:04:02,390
he gives you a guy.

2434
01:04:02,390 --> 01:04:02,651
He's like,

2435
01:04:02,651 --> 01:04:03,280
I just,

2436
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:03,580
I,

2437
01:04:03,580 --> 01:04:04,660
my mom's asked for privacy.

2438
01:04:04,661 --> 01:04:05,470
I'm just trying to give that to her.

2439
01:04:05,470 --> 01:04:06,131
He kept saying that.

2440
01:04:06,131 --> 01:04:06,491
So I'm like,

2441
01:04:06,491 --> 01:04:07,120
all right.

2442
01:04:07,120 --> 01:04:07,691
So finally,

2443
01:04:07,691 --> 01:04:08,321
eventually he goes,

2444
01:04:08,321 --> 01:04:09,340
here's the address and he gives me,

2445
01:04:09,341 --> 01:04:10,870
this address is five to five Kilkia.

2446
01:04:11,230 --> 01:04:11,591
So I'm like,

2447
01:04:11,591 --> 01:04:11,920
all right,

2448
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:13,120
that's not the real addresses it,

2449
01:04:13,300 --> 01:04:14,710
so I have this address.

2450
01:04:14,740 --> 01:04:14,951
I'm like,

2451
01:04:14,951 --> 01:04:15,610
okay.

2452
01:04:15,610 --> 01:04:16,031
Thinking,

2453
01:04:16,031 --> 01:04:16,181
wow,

2454
01:04:16,181 --> 01:04:17,770
that took a lot for
you to give that to me,

2455
01:04:17,890 --> 01:04:18,130
right?

2456
01:04:18,130 --> 01:04:20,590
Like this is clearly an issue and
everyone's got their boundaries.

2457
01:04:20,591 --> 01:04:21,550
Everyone's got their baggage.

2458
01:04:21,551 --> 01:04:23,410
And I was trying to be respectful of that.

2459
01:04:23,900 --> 01:04:24,790
Couple of weeks go by,

2460
01:04:25,810 --> 01:04:27,280
my mom calls the Yale's registered,

2461
01:04:27,281 --> 01:04:31,420
he'll registrar's office because it's
such a out no record of this guy ever

2462
01:04:31,421 --> 01:04:32,050
graduating.

2463
01:04:32,050 --> 01:04:32,441
Oh,

2464
01:04:32,441 --> 01:04:34,300
your mom's awesome as what everybody says.

2465
01:04:34,301 --> 01:04:35,410
So I call him and I'm like,

2466
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:37,600
and I'm trying to be cool
about it because again,

2467
01:04:37,601 --> 01:04:40,990
like this is someone that I love and
we've traveled together and you don't want

2468
01:04:40,991 --> 01:04:41,824
to push it.

2469
01:04:42,010 --> 01:04:42,640
And he's like,

2470
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:43,570
I don't know.

2471
01:04:43,571 --> 01:04:45,370
I was only on campus
for this amount of time.

2472
01:04:45,371 --> 01:04:48,760
Did [inaudible] he'd already invited me
to go to England with him for a skull

2473
01:04:48,761 --> 01:04:49,930
and bones reunion,

2474
01:04:50,940 --> 01:04:51,760
like a whole thing and wait,

2475
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:53,380
it got canceled because
his mom had cancer.

2476
01:04:53,381 --> 01:04:54,880
So like I'm like letting all this go.

2477
01:04:55,570 --> 01:04:56,440
So he goes out of town,

2478
01:04:57,550 --> 01:05:00,730
I go to five to five
Kilkia it doesn't exist.

2479
01:05:01,560 --> 01:05:03,000
Oh No.

2480
01:05:03,310 --> 01:05:04,300
I call him and I'm like,

2481
01:05:04,301 --> 01:05:06,160
what are you fucking doing?

2482
01:05:06,610 --> 01:05:10,330
And he goes and he launching the story
goes when I lived in the city he lived in

2483
01:05:10,331 --> 01:05:10,841
before he goes,

2484
01:05:10,841 --> 01:05:12,010
I had this crazy ex girlfriend,

2485
01:05:12,011 --> 01:05:13,180
everyone's got a crazy ex.

2486
01:05:13,510 --> 01:05:13,961
He was like,

2487
01:05:13,961 --> 01:05:18,730
and basically she wreak havoc on my life
and my personal life with my family and

2488
01:05:18,731 --> 01:05:19,750
I'm just very protective of that.

2489
01:05:19,751 --> 01:05:22,450
And my mom's sick and I'm just
trying to like keep her out of that.

2490
01:05:23,350 --> 01:05:23,861
So I was like,

2491
01:05:23,861 --> 01:05:24,694
okay.

2492
01:05:24,850 --> 01:05:25,091
I was like,

2493
01:05:25,091 --> 01:05:26,080
you need to give me your address.

2494
01:05:26,081 --> 01:05:27,820
This is the last time I'm
going to ask you for this.

2495
01:05:28,420 --> 01:05:29,620
And I'm trying not to like push him.

2496
01:05:29,660 --> 01:05:30,191
So he comes over,

2497
01:05:30,191 --> 01:05:31,300
he gives me the address,

2498
01:05:31,330 --> 01:05:32,470
his mom's number and his email.

2499
01:05:32,471 --> 01:05:32,860
He's like,

2500
01:05:32,860 --> 01:05:33,581
I'm an open book,

2501
01:05:33,581 --> 01:05:34,450
whatever you want to know.

2502
01:05:34,900 --> 01:05:36,310
So I took that as a sign of like,

2503
01:05:36,311 --> 01:05:36,581
wow,

2504
01:05:36,581 --> 01:05:37,690
that was really hard for you.

2505
01:05:38,890 --> 01:05:40,030
Gail registrar comes back,

2506
01:05:40,360 --> 01:05:41,440
no record of him.

2507
01:05:42,010 --> 01:05:42,310
Uh,

2508
01:05:42,310 --> 01:05:45,790
none of my friends that went to Yale
know who he is and every time I ask him

2509
01:05:45,791 --> 01:05:46,241
anything,

2510
01:05:46,241 --> 01:05:47,500
like the answer is super simple.

2511
01:05:47,501 --> 01:05:48,311
Like if I asked you where you live,

2512
01:05:48,311 --> 01:05:49,810
you just tell me to just
roll off your tongue.

2513
01:05:49,811 --> 01:05:52,390
And that's everything was
so I go to that house,

2514
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:53,650
like I let a couple of weeks go by,

2515
01:05:53,651 --> 01:05:54,730
my birthday happens,

2516
01:05:54,731 --> 01:05:55,331
we had Christmas,

2517
01:05:55,331 --> 01:05:56,164
my birthday,

2518
01:05:56,610 --> 01:06:00,220
and it's a day before I'm leaving for
San Antonio to go play this comedy club.

2519
01:06:00,280 --> 01:06:03,820
And I go to his house with my
friend and it's not his house,

2520
01:06:03,940 --> 01:06:04,960
it's like some other woman lives.

2521
01:06:04,961 --> 01:06:06,040
They're like an old woman lives there.

2522
01:06:06,550 --> 01:06:07,510
It's not as mom's house.

2523
01:06:07,511 --> 01:06:08,710
And he sees like my mom,

2524
01:06:08,920 --> 01:06:09,400
he's like,

2525
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:11,770
my mom bought the house from
me to keep my cash liquid.

2526
01:06:11,771 --> 01:06:12,760
The title's not in her name.

2527
01:06:13,210 --> 01:06:13,871
I call him.

2528
01:06:13,871 --> 01:06:14,704
And I was like,

2529
01:06:15,070 --> 01:06:19,360
I'm walking out of your life because
you're lying about something.

2530
01:06:19,810 --> 01:06:22,330
And it all came crashing
down at 7:00 AM he texts me,

2531
01:06:22,331 --> 01:06:23,080
he goes,

2532
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:23,920
I never went to Yale.

2533
01:06:24,310 --> 01:06:25,180
I never bought a house.

2534
01:06:25,630 --> 01:06:27,310
I've been lying to you for over a year.

2535
01:06:29,470 --> 01:06:31,700
And so it was just one of those.

2536
01:06:32,170 --> 01:06:34,990
And then so you start going back and
then you start wondering if you're crazy

2537
01:06:35,290 --> 01:06:35,891
and then you're like,

2538
01:06:35,891 --> 01:06:38,110
does your mom even if cancer did you,

2539
01:06:38,140 --> 01:06:39,880
are you really in this moment cancer?

2540
01:06:40,330 --> 01:06:41,500
I'm going to say she does,

2541
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:45,700
but I think it's really weird that I
met her once and then like I was like,

2542
01:06:45,701 --> 01:06:47,950
what's the name of the doctor
at the hospital where she is?

2543
01:06:47,951 --> 01:06:48,191
He's like,

2544
01:06:48,191 --> 01:06:49,024
I don't know,

2545
01:06:49,720 --> 01:06:51,370
like very like wouldn't
give any information.

2546
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:52,233
This is,

2547
01:06:52,270 --> 01:06:54,850
and so yesterday I wrote an email,

2548
01:06:54,940 --> 01:06:55,870
I don't know why I'm sharing all of this,

2549
01:06:55,871 --> 01:06:56,920
but this is very funny to me.

2550
01:06:57,280 --> 01:06:58,091
I wrote everybody,

2551
01:06:58,091 --> 01:06:59,200
when you break up with someone,

2552
01:06:59,660 --> 01:07:01,090
depending on how tactful you are,

2553
01:07:01,630 --> 01:07:04,510
you hold back on what you want to say.

2554
01:07:04,690 --> 01:07:05,171
Like we all say,

2555
01:07:05,171 --> 01:07:05,891
look or you're an asshole.

2556
01:07:05,891 --> 01:07:06,311
I hate you.

2557
01:07:06,311 --> 01:07:09,400
But like then there's like the dark
shit that you don't write and I wrote an

2558
01:07:09,401 --> 01:07:10,900
email that I almost,

2559
01:07:10,901 --> 01:07:11,381
I won't do it,

2560
01:07:11,381 --> 01:07:15,490
but I almost want to post online as like
a template for any girl that ever wants

2561
01:07:15,491 --> 01:07:17,290
to like enrage her next boyfriend.

2562
01:07:17,740 --> 01:07:20,170
And I just lost my shit
and it felt so good.

2563
01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:21,131
Like fuck.

2564
01:07:21,131 --> 01:07:21,964
Having tact.

2565
01:07:22,540 --> 01:07:23,890
Like it just was the best thing ever.

2566
01:07:24,760 --> 01:07:29,760
Well it sounds like you gave him every
possible every possible scenario for him

2567
01:07:31,571 --> 01:07:32,770
to be truthful.

2568
01:07:33,130 --> 01:07:38,130
Like you gave him every possible like
well maybe he's this and maybe it's that

2569
01:07:38,651 --> 01:07:40,660
you gave a lot of leeway.

2570
01:07:40,690 --> 01:07:42,700
So much so and then every day I'd be like,

2571
01:07:42,701 --> 01:07:43,211
if you're lying,

2572
01:07:43,211 --> 01:07:43,991
please just tell me.

2573
01:07:43,991 --> 01:07:44,850
Or just tell anyone,

2574
01:07:44,860 --> 01:07:45,790
look me in the eye and be like,

2575
01:07:45,791 --> 01:07:46,624
I'm not lying.

2576
01:07:47,320 --> 01:07:48,820
Which makes me think
if we ever got married,

2577
01:07:48,821 --> 01:07:50,230
we would go on a boat
and he would kill me.

2578
01:07:50,620 --> 01:07:51,580
But the whole never know.

2579
01:07:51,581 --> 01:07:51,910
Right.

2580
01:07:51,910 --> 01:07:53,470
You never tell that shit happens.

2581
01:07:53,650 --> 01:07:57,610
You find out he's got a life insurance
policy on you and I accidentally signed

2582
01:07:57,611 --> 01:07:57,880
it.

2583
01:07:57,880 --> 01:07:59,170
Did you find out where he worked?

2584
01:07:59,171 --> 01:08:00,670
Did he actually have the job that he had?

2585
01:08:00,700 --> 01:08:02,620
He had left the company and
all of these things are weird.

2586
01:08:02,621 --> 01:08:06,370
Like he left the company and like a
weird way and he started his own so that

2587
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:06,960
like I just,

2588
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:10,050
it's at some point it's not up to you
to piece together what's real and what

2589
01:08:10,051 --> 01:08:10,710
isn't.

2590
01:08:10,710 --> 01:08:13,230
I told this story on the radio in
Tampa and when I got off the air,

2591
01:08:13,380 --> 01:08:15,770
all of these people had
sent me tweets with Yale

2592
01:08:17,150 --> 01:08:19,790
and somebody sent me a picture of
someone running the Boston marathon in a

2593
01:08:19,791 --> 01:08:20,571
yellow shirt and they're like,

2594
01:08:20,571 --> 01:08:22,460
is your ex boyfriend
running the Boston marathon?

2595
01:08:23,810 --> 01:08:24,950
Oh that poor bastard.

2596
01:08:24,951 --> 01:08:28,100
I'm glad you don't say his name publicly
shame him because the poor fuck is

2597
01:08:28,101 --> 01:08:28,880
already a mess.

2598
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:29,990
I told him he's fucking lucky.

2599
01:08:29,991 --> 01:08:30,261
I'm like,

2600
01:08:30,261 --> 01:08:31,610
you're I think on that show I did,

2601
01:08:31,611 --> 01:08:32,240
but I didn't.

2602
01:08:32,240 --> 01:08:33,440
I've never say the last name.

2603
01:08:34,670 --> 01:08:39,020
Well he is lucky you could make them a
part of your act with his actual name.

2604
01:08:39,140 --> 01:08:41,120
It's so be a killer bit.

2605
01:08:41,390 --> 01:08:45,170
If I could think of unrelatable the
whole like the exact amount of lying and

2606
01:08:45,171 --> 01:08:49,710
cheating thing saying I thought
man you meant like as a bit right.

2607
01:08:50,120 --> 01:08:51,350
I think it's very relatable.

2608
01:08:51,380 --> 01:08:52,490
I think I will get around to it.

2609
01:08:52,491 --> 01:08:54,410
I think eventually it'll stop.

2610
01:08:54,440 --> 01:08:55,270
I'll stop being,

2611
01:08:55,270 --> 01:08:56,240
cause I'm not sad anymore,

2612
01:08:56,241 --> 01:08:59,810
but my email pretty much
included cause like obviously,

2613
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:02,120
you know if you break up with someone
you don't want to hear about people

2614
01:09:02,121 --> 01:09:02,954
they're sleeping with.

2615
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:03,650
Right.

2616
01:09:03,650 --> 01:09:06,410
He got upset because I posted a
picture when I was in Saint Martin of

2617
01:09:06,420 --> 01:09:09,380
[inaudible] topless beach with
two friends in front of me.

2618
01:09:09,530 --> 01:09:10,400
So you can't see anything.

2619
01:09:10,820 --> 01:09:11,211
And he was like,

2620
01:09:11,211 --> 01:09:13,580
I felt that you posted that
picture and it was directed at me,

2621
01:09:13,581 --> 01:09:15,680
which it wasn't like I
posted like a hot picture.

2622
01:09:16,250 --> 01:09:18,380
And so I just unleashed on
this email and I was like,

2623
01:09:18,530 --> 01:09:19,370
it's none of your fucking business.

2624
01:09:19,371 --> 01:09:19,881
What I do.

2625
01:09:19,881 --> 01:09:20,361
And by the way,

2626
01:09:20,361 --> 01:09:21,194
when I was in Saint Martin,

2627
01:09:21,320 --> 01:09:24,440
I hooked up with a guy when he went down
on me for 20 minutes and it was fucking

2628
01:09:24,470 --> 01:09:25,303
awesome.

2629
01:09:25,550 --> 01:09:26,630
I will never talk to you.

2630
01:09:27,980 --> 01:09:28,910
Whoa.

2631
01:09:29,630 --> 01:09:30,380
That's dark.

2632
01:09:30,380 --> 01:09:31,213
It felt so good.

2633
01:09:32,060 --> 01:09:32,181
Oh,

2634
01:09:32,181 --> 01:09:33,260
the act makes you cringe.

2635
01:09:33,380 --> 01:09:34,420
But the idea of not around.

2636
01:09:34,440 --> 01:09:34,700
No,

2637
01:09:34,700 --> 01:09:34,971
no,

2638
01:09:34,971 --> 01:09:35,181
no.

2639
01:09:35,181 --> 01:09:37,490
The act doesn't make me cringe at all.

2640
01:09:37,510 --> 01:09:39,920
Were you writing that email and say,

2641
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:40,780
look,

2642
01:09:40,780 --> 01:09:41,571
I'm a guy and he went down.

2643
01:09:41,571 --> 01:09:42,340
He ate my pleasure.

2644
01:09:42,340 --> 01:09:43,190
I did not say that.

2645
01:09:43,250 --> 01:09:44,150
I didn't say anything.

2646
01:09:44,210 --> 01:09:45,350
Same thing you said it.

2647
01:09:45,440 --> 01:09:46,430
Here's the question though.

2648
01:09:46,850 --> 01:09:50,510
At what point are you as a human being
allowed to just unleash and be like,

2649
01:09:50,511 --> 01:09:51,344
that's it?

2650
01:09:51,370 --> 01:09:52,130
Well,

2651
01:09:52,130 --> 01:09:52,963
yes.

2652
01:09:53,030 --> 01:09:53,631
Honestly,

2653
01:09:53,631 --> 01:09:55,370
I don't think that
guy's worth your effort,

2654
01:09:55,910 --> 01:09:56,181
you know,

2655
01:09:56,181 --> 01:09:58,820
making more tension with him.

2656
01:09:58,850 --> 01:09:59,211
I mean that,

2657
01:09:59,211 --> 01:10:00,350
that's a crazy person.

2658
01:10:00,500 --> 01:10:02,450
That guy's fabricating and existence.

2659
01:10:02,451 --> 01:10:03,920
He fabricated his education.

2660
01:10:03,921 --> 01:10:04,550
He fabric.

2661
01:10:04,550 --> 01:10:07,010
He may have fabricated
his mother being sick.

2662
01:10:07,011 --> 01:10:10,760
He fabricated where he
lived twice or three times.

2663
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:11,720
Three times.

2664
01:10:11,720 --> 01:10:12,020
Yeah.

2665
01:10:12,020 --> 01:10:12,231
Yeah.

2666
01:10:12,231 --> 01:10:13,064
I mean he's,

2667
01:10:13,220 --> 01:10:15,710
he's probably pathological.

2668
01:10:15,830 --> 01:10:16,221
You know,

2669
01:10:16,221 --> 01:10:18,260
there are people that
just can't stop lying.

2670
01:10:18,650 --> 01:10:18,981
You know,

2671
01:10:18,981 --> 01:10:20,780
I've seen it before when,

2672
01:10:20,781 --> 01:10:21,614
um,

2673
01:10:22,070 --> 01:10:23,450
you're living in Hollywood,

2674
01:10:23,480 --> 01:10:23,751
you know,

2675
01:10:23,751 --> 01:10:24,830
if you live around here,

2676
01:10:24,831 --> 01:10:25,130
you,

2677
01:10:25,130 --> 01:10:26,480
you'll meet people that are,

2678
01:10:26,720 --> 01:10:26,931
you know,

2679
01:10:26,931 --> 01:10:30,050
fake it til you make it type people that
will tell you stories that just don't

2680
01:10:30,200 --> 01:10:30,980
add up.

2681
01:10:30,980 --> 01:10:34,010
And in the old days you used to just
have to kind of accept people at those

2682
01:10:34,011 --> 01:10:34,844
stories.

2683
01:10:34,850 --> 01:10:37,910
But now your mom can just Google
them and find out anything

2684
01:10:38,250 --> 01:10:39,083
she got on it.

2685
01:10:39,750 --> 01:10:40,200
Ah,

2686
01:10:40,200 --> 01:10:41,490
you're on and got on it.

2687
01:10:42,070 --> 01:10:42,331
Wow.

2688
01:10:42,331 --> 01:10:43,260
Your mom's awesome.

2689
01:10:43,290 --> 01:10:43,950
Good for her.

2690
01:10:43,950 --> 01:10:44,783
Well,

2691
01:10:45,180 --> 01:10:46,020
let me ask you this,

2692
01:10:46,021 --> 01:10:46,561
cause this is,

2693
01:10:46,561 --> 01:10:47,394
um,

2694
01:10:47,970 --> 01:10:52,110
this is the difference between a man and
a woman because you could tell me that

2695
01:10:52,111 --> 01:10:56,610
you went to pierce college or you went
to a high school and you dropped out when

2696
01:10:56,611 --> 01:10:57,630
you were 16.

2697
01:10:57,660 --> 01:10:58,700
And if you're,

2698
01:10:58,710 --> 01:11:00,060
you and I like you,

2699
01:11:00,061 --> 01:11:00,990
I don't care at all.

2700
01:11:01,050 --> 01:11:02,340
It doesn't mean anything to me.

2701
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:04,170
I don't care if you're a nurse.

2702
01:11:04,350 --> 01:11:05,820
I don't care if you're a doctor.

2703
01:11:05,821 --> 01:11:10,170
I don't care if you're a brain surgeon
or a girl who works in a clothing store.

2704
01:11:10,290 --> 01:11:10,410
Right.

2705
01:11:10,410 --> 01:11:12,570
It doesn't matter to me who
would care if I do not care,

2706
01:11:12,940 --> 01:11:14,130
do not care if

2707
01:11:14,130 --> 01:11:15,840
someone's fun and nice to be around.

2708
01:11:15,841 --> 01:11:16,740
I do not care.

2709
01:11:16,890 --> 01:11:17,550
I really don't.

2710
01:11:17,550 --> 01:11:18,211
I never have.

2711
01:11:18,211 --> 01:11:19,044
I never will.

2712
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:20,010
Um,

2713
01:11:20,010 --> 01:11:21,330
obviously it's,

2714
01:11:22,070 --> 01:11:22,380
it's,

2715
01:11:22,380 --> 01:11:24,960
there's a difference
between a man and a woman,

2716
01:11:25,190 --> 01:11:29,040
like women desire men to be successful.

2717
01:11:29,290 --> 01:11:29,700
Sure.

2718
01:11:29,700 --> 01:11:30,511
And that's a whole,

2719
01:11:30,511 --> 01:11:32,730
that's an evolution thing and
that's a protective thing.

2720
01:11:32,731 --> 01:11:33,480
And that's,

2721
01:11:33,480 --> 01:11:34,313
I get that.

2722
01:11:34,350 --> 01:11:37,080
Obviously I don't want to
date like a homeless person.

2723
01:11:37,110 --> 01:11:37,943
Right.

2724
01:11:37,970 --> 01:11:39,060
What killed nor does,

2725
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:39,740
nor do I.

2726
01:11:39,740 --> 01:11:40,010
Yeah.

2727
01:11:40,010 --> 01:11:40,400
I mean,

2728
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:43,310
I don't want someone who
can't feed themselves does,

2729
01:11:43,660 --> 01:11:44,200
you know,

2730
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:45,033
it's about quality.

2731
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:48,060
What kills me is that those
things genuinely don't matter.

2732
01:11:48,510 --> 01:11:50,550
And he chose to judge me ahead of time,

2733
01:11:50,551 --> 01:11:54,570
or maybe he's got a chemical imbalance
from the day I met him on the plane.

2734
01:11:54,571 --> 01:11:55,404
I went to Yale.

2735
01:11:55,590 --> 01:11:57,840
Nothing wrong with lying to a
stranger or a pretty girl on a plane.

2736
01:11:58,320 --> 01:12:00,340
I don't care where there is
something wrong with Kenya.

2737
01:12:00,440 --> 01:12:00,930
There's no,

2738
01:12:00,930 --> 01:12:03,510
there's no ramifications for lying to
a stranger if you never see them again.

2739
01:12:03,590 --> 01:12:03,950
Right,

2740
01:12:03,950 --> 01:12:04,290
right.

2741
01:12:04,290 --> 01:12:04,870
Okay.

2742
01:12:04,870 --> 01:12:05,703
Um,

2743
01:12:05,790 --> 01:12:06,630
that doesn't bother me.

2744
01:12:06,631 --> 01:12:09,120
I don't care if you own
a house so it irks it.

2745
01:12:09,130 --> 01:12:11,040
It's a shame because you
lied about two things.

2746
01:12:11,041 --> 01:12:14,190
Let's say it's just too and you
ruined a perfectly good relationship.

2747
01:12:14,220 --> 01:12:16,050
If it's just those two
things in your insecure.

2748
01:12:16,530 --> 01:12:17,251
I didn't go to Harvard.

2749
01:12:17,251 --> 01:12:18,061
I'm not a road scholar.

2750
01:12:18,061 --> 01:12:19,140
I don't care if you went to Yale,

2751
01:12:19,410 --> 01:12:20,730
how long did you guys date for him?

2752
01:12:21,030 --> 01:12:23,310
I knew him for over a year and
we dated for about three months.

2753
01:12:23,580 --> 01:12:27,480
And what was it about his personality
that was attractive to you?

2754
01:12:28,050 --> 01:12:31,380
Does a whizzer a unique
thing you could define?

2755
01:12:31,410 --> 01:12:32,243
Truthfully,

2756
01:12:32,730 --> 01:12:34,680
I mean as friends he was very smart.

2757
01:12:35,130 --> 01:12:35,941
I really,

2758
01:12:35,941 --> 01:12:39,480
for me intelligence is a huge thing
and very in a little like funniest,

2759
01:12:39,481 --> 01:12:40,230
snobby way,

2760
01:12:40,230 --> 01:12:43,020
like a little con and I kind of
liked that and he's very smart,

2761
01:12:43,021 --> 01:12:43,261
very,

2762
01:12:43,261 --> 01:12:44,070
very smart,

2763
01:12:44,070 --> 01:12:44,851
a little Dorky,

2764
01:12:44,851 --> 01:12:45,684
very smart.

2765
01:12:45,900 --> 01:12:47,490
But when he,

2766
01:12:47,491 --> 01:12:49,680
when we were friends and when
he called me and was like,

2767
01:12:49,681 --> 01:12:52,950
we can't go on this trip to the skull and
bones thing because my mom has cancer.

2768
01:12:53,550 --> 01:12:54,241
I got a chance.

2769
01:12:54,241 --> 01:12:54,900
This is going to be weird.

2770
01:12:54,900 --> 01:12:55,380
I don't know if,

2771
01:12:55,380 --> 01:12:59,220
I think only women will relate to this
for the whole time we knew each other.

2772
01:12:59,310 --> 01:13:00,600
He put me on this pedestal,

2773
01:13:01,110 --> 01:13:01,891
always asking,

2774
01:13:01,891 --> 01:13:02,461
can you please,

2775
01:13:02,461 --> 01:13:03,211
can we please date?

2776
01:13:03,211 --> 01:13:03,841
Can I have the kids?

2777
01:13:03,841 --> 01:13:04,740
Will you be my girlfriend?

2778
01:13:04,741 --> 01:13:05,161
And I were like,

2779
01:13:05,161 --> 01:13:05,851
we would hang out.

2780
01:13:05,851 --> 01:13:06,301
And I was like,

2781
01:13:06,301 --> 01:13:06,781
stop it.

2782
01:13:06,781 --> 01:13:07,614
Like I'm not into this.

2783
01:13:08,130 --> 01:13:10,530
So no one wants to be on a pedestal
because there's nothing for you to do.

2784
01:13:10,980 --> 01:13:11,701
His mom had cancer.

2785
01:13:11,701 --> 01:13:12,030
I was like,

2786
01:13:12,030 --> 01:13:12,821
I can take care of you.

2787
01:13:12,821 --> 01:13:14,580
And now like you've been
nothing but sweet to me.

2788
01:13:14,970 --> 01:13:16,140
Now let me take care of you.

2789
01:13:16,140 --> 01:13:17,640
And in getting to take care of him,

2790
01:13:18,210 --> 01:13:21,390
I started to like him cause
I had like an active role.

2791
01:13:21,490 --> 01:13:22,650
It's so crazy.

2792
01:13:23,430 --> 01:13:24,870
Um Wow.

2793
01:13:24,871 --> 01:13:25,650
That's so crazy.

2794
01:13:25,650 --> 01:13:25,831
But yeah,

2795
01:13:25,831 --> 01:13:27,000
those things didn't matter.

2796
01:13:27,030 --> 01:13:30,820
So is that like the maternal
instincts that you have is like the,

2797
01:13:30,830 --> 01:13:32,910
the taking care of instincts,

2798
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:33,300
you know,

2799
01:13:33,300 --> 01:13:36,180
because some women have those
instincts sort of built in those?

2800
01:13:36,240 --> 01:13:36,661
I think so.

2801
01:13:36,661 --> 01:13:38,160
But I think it was also just,

2802
01:13:38,970 --> 01:13:42,510
there was nothing for me to do to have
an active role in our relationship as

2803
01:13:42,511 --> 01:13:42,901
friends.

2804
01:13:42,901 --> 01:13:47,580
Like he had a lot of money and a lot of
time and he could do nice things like he

2805
01:13:47,581 --> 01:13:47,940
would,

2806
01:13:47,940 --> 01:13:50,190
did he really have a lot of money
because they have a lot of money.

2807
01:13:50,220 --> 01:13:51,001
Well how's that possible?

2808
01:13:51,001 --> 01:13:52,050
He has a fucking roommate.

2809
01:13:52,620 --> 01:13:53,401
So the roommate,

2810
01:13:53,401 --> 01:13:53,650
if,

2811
01:13:53,650 --> 01:13:54,720
if the answer was he goes,

2812
01:13:54,721 --> 01:13:56,160
I have my lease was up in Santa Monica.

2813
01:13:56,280 --> 01:13:56,971
I was going to buy a house.

2814
01:13:56,971 --> 01:13:58,380
But then I decided I thought
it was going to move.

2815
01:13:58,410 --> 01:13:58,920
He goes again.

2816
01:13:58,920 --> 01:13:59,790
Then you and I started dating.

2817
01:13:59,791 --> 01:14:00,570
I didn't want to move.

2818
01:14:00,570 --> 01:14:04,080
I moved in with a friend to help her pay
her rent cause he's never home and he's

2819
01:14:04,081 --> 01:14:04,171
like,

2820
01:14:04,171 --> 01:14:07,410
so I just leave my stuff there but how
can you even trust that I couldn't,

2821
01:14:07,411 --> 01:14:11,220
he did send me a picture of his bank
account to like why he was a human being.

2822
01:14:11,470 --> 01:14:12,011
Come on,

2823
01:14:12,011 --> 01:14:12,844
I didn't ask for it.

2824
01:14:12,970 --> 01:14:14,530
He sent you the numbers in his bag.

2825
01:14:14,650 --> 01:14:16,270
He sent me like a screen grab of it.

2826
01:14:16,420 --> 01:14:18,410
This motherfucker
doctored his bank account,

2827
01:14:18,940 --> 01:14:21,040
Photoshop the shit out
of his bank account.

2828
01:14:21,050 --> 01:14:21,190
I,

2829
01:14:21,190 --> 01:14:21,391
I,

2830
01:14:21,391 --> 01:14:21,700
you know,

2831
01:14:21,700 --> 01:14:23,500
I saw the way he lived in the way he,

2832
01:14:23,501 --> 01:14:26,530
I mean I do think the money thing is real.

2833
01:14:26,531 --> 01:14:26,921
We did,

2834
01:14:26,921 --> 01:14:27,790
maybe it may,

2835
01:14:27,791 --> 01:14:29,500
I may or may not have
done a background check.

2836
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:32,380
So I definitely know when he came from.

2837
01:14:33,320 --> 01:14:34,153
Um,

2838
01:14:34,900 --> 01:14:37,720
but the answer your question
to the House and the,

2839
01:14:37,721 --> 01:14:38,620
the college and like,

2840
01:14:38,760 --> 01:14:40,300
he lied about weird things.

2841
01:14:41,230 --> 01:14:42,063
What is that?

2842
01:14:42,790 --> 01:14:43,810
That's a weird thing,

2843
01:14:43,811 --> 01:14:44,644
man.

2844
01:14:45,210 --> 01:14:46,990
That's saying you went to Yale,

2845
01:14:47,530 --> 01:14:48,320
like the,

2846
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:48,620
you know,

2847
01:14:48,620 --> 01:14:49,181
Harvard,

2848
01:14:49,181 --> 01:14:50,014
Yale,

2849
01:14:50,410 --> 01:14:51,310
Ivy League.

2850
01:14:51,311 --> 01:14:51,551
Like,

2851
01:14:51,551 --> 01:14:51,980
that's like,

2852
01:14:51,980 --> 01:14:52,813
Ooh,

2853
01:14:53,650 --> 01:14:54,260
I don't,

2854
01:14:54,260 --> 01:14:55,031
and then he would sit in,

2855
01:14:55,031 --> 01:14:57,890
my cousin went to Yale and they would
have a conversation and he would talk

2856
01:14:57,891 --> 01:14:58,724
about it.

2857
01:14:58,770 --> 01:14:59,300
What?

2858
01:14:59,300 --> 01:15:00,133
Yeah.

2859
01:15:00,430 --> 01:15:01,330
Oh my God.

2860
01:15:01,331 --> 01:15:02,950
Poor bet you're ripping
paper over there for you.

2861
01:15:02,951 --> 01:15:03,140
Right.

2862
01:15:03,140 --> 01:15:04,280
And she's going crazy.

2863
01:15:04,710 --> 01:15:06,130
It's just so like the Tucker,

2864
01:15:06,430 --> 01:15:06,541
no,

2865
01:15:06,541 --> 01:15:06,961
not even that.

2866
01:15:06,961 --> 01:15:07,794
Every time

2867
01:15:07,980 --> 01:15:08,761
go back and I'm like,

2868
01:15:08,761 --> 01:15:09,060
what,

2869
01:15:09,060 --> 01:15:10,350
what clues did I miss?

2870
01:15:10,351 --> 01:15:10,951
What am I,

2871
01:15:10,951 --> 01:15:11,191
and like,

2872
01:15:11,191 --> 01:15:12,024
what,

2873
01:15:12,210 --> 01:15:13,350
what am I realizing now?

2874
01:15:13,351 --> 01:15:15,030
Like I'm trying to like put the dot,

2875
01:15:15,031 --> 01:15:15,870
like connect the dots.

2876
01:15:16,110 --> 01:15:17,280
The day I met him,

2877
01:15:18,300 --> 01:15:22,500
I went on Twitter and I followed him
and his Twitter handle an had a Yale

2878
01:15:22,501 --> 01:15:23,334
reference in it.

2879
01:15:23,850 --> 01:15:25,110
And I asked him like when we broke up,

2880
01:15:25,111 --> 01:15:25,351
I was like,

2881
01:15:25,351 --> 01:15:26,880
even your Twitter was about Yale.

2882
01:15:26,881 --> 01:15:27,271
And he was like,

2883
01:15:27,271 --> 01:15:28,830
I made up my Twitter
account the day I met you.

2884
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:30,460
Whoa.

2885
01:15:30,461 --> 01:15:32,200
Just because he met you and he wanted,

2886
01:15:32,280 --> 01:15:33,670
oh my God,

2887
01:15:34,870 --> 01:15:35,201
he didn't.

2888
01:15:35,201 --> 01:15:35,741
Maybe he lied.

2889
01:15:35,741 --> 01:15:36,820
Maybe he changed the name.

2890
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:38,560
Uh Wow.

2891
01:15:38,561 --> 01:15:39,400
What a psycho.

2892
01:15:39,430 --> 01:15:40,510
And every time I tell the story,

2893
01:15:40,511 --> 01:15:42,490
like I think about different
things that I missed.

2894
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:44,950
So Jesus Christ,

2895
01:15:45,160 --> 01:15:47,710
the good news is when something
that weird happens to you,

2896
01:15:48,250 --> 01:15:49,660
there's no lesson to be learned.

2897
01:15:49,661 --> 01:15:50,494
It's not like,

2898
01:15:50,650 --> 01:15:50,831
oh,

2899
01:15:50,831 --> 01:15:51,730
I thought he was cheating.

2900
01:15:51,731 --> 01:15:52,720
Like that's a normal thing.

2901
01:15:52,721 --> 01:15:55,270
Like this is not something I'll
take into another relationship.

2902
01:15:55,720 --> 01:15:56,270
Like I'm not,

2903
01:15:56,270 --> 01:16:01,240
you kind of do because you guys do
lie about their past to become more

2904
01:16:01,241 --> 01:16:02,500
impressive to a girl.

2905
01:16:02,770 --> 01:16:03,011
You know?

2906
01:16:03,011 --> 01:16:03,830
I mean it is really,

2907
01:16:03,830 --> 01:16:04,870
it's super common,

2908
01:16:04,990 --> 01:16:05,823
right?

2909
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:10,840
And now you'll sort of recognize those
sort of bullshit signs maybe quicker.

2910
01:16:12,580 --> 01:16:12,731
Well,

2911
01:16:12,731 --> 01:16:14,800
maybe it's like when a
guy throws that out there,

2912
01:16:14,801 --> 01:16:16,300
like makes a big deal out of it.

2913
01:16:16,301 --> 01:16:17,680
Like maybe that's when you look.

2914
01:16:17,950 --> 01:16:18,783
Maybe,

2915
01:16:19,320 --> 01:16:20,100
maybe.

2916
01:16:20,100 --> 01:16:23,610
I mean some people like
it wasn't really online.

2917
01:16:23,611 --> 01:16:25,790
Some people take pride in not
really being online a lot that,

2918
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:26,640
I mean the Internet helps.

2919
01:16:26,641 --> 01:16:26,941
Like and when,

2920
01:16:26,941 --> 01:16:27,450
if you can,

2921
01:16:27,450 --> 01:16:30,240
I went on a date last night and you
could Google the guy and everything about

2922
01:16:30,241 --> 01:16:31,074
him is there

2923
01:16:31,960 --> 01:16:32,793
and you're like,

2924
01:16:35,560 --> 01:16:37,300
me and this guy had no friends in common.

2925
01:16:37,301 --> 01:16:40,570
Like the email I wrote him was so,

2926
01:16:41,290 --> 01:16:43,360
I guess so pointed it to me.

2927
01:16:43,570 --> 01:16:43,901
I'll send it,

2928
01:16:43,901 --> 01:16:44,800
I'll show it to you right after this.

2929
01:16:45,250 --> 01:16:47,290
I went online and he
deleted his Twitter account.

2930
01:16:47,500 --> 01:16:47,651
Like,

2931
01:16:47,651 --> 01:16:49,930
I think I made this
motherfucker leave cyberspace.

2932
01:16:51,130 --> 01:16:51,281
Oh,

2933
01:16:51,281 --> 01:16:51,731
it's bad.

2934
01:16:51,731 --> 01:16:52,481
Well you should.

2935
01:16:52,481 --> 01:16:54,070
I mean that's for him.

2936
01:16:54,071 --> 01:16:58,150
It's gotta be some people just do that
over and over and over again though.

2937
01:16:58,810 --> 01:17:02,290
My friend Eddie met this guy and this guy,

2938
01:17:02,350 --> 01:17:03,183
um,

2939
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:05,620
he was working on,

2940
01:17:05,690 --> 01:17:07,960
he wanted to put him in some project.

2941
01:17:07,961 --> 01:17:10,130
He was doing some television and

2942
01:17:10,130 --> 01:17:14,690
he claimed that he had these studios and
he was working with all these networks

2943
01:17:14,691 --> 01:17:15,524
and this and that.

2944
01:17:15,980 --> 01:17:18,050
But where we found out
that he was full of Shit,

2945
01:17:18,080 --> 01:17:19,640
I thought he was full of Shit right away.

2946
01:17:19,700 --> 01:17:20,301
I told Eddie,

2947
01:17:20,301 --> 01:17:20,600
Alec,

2948
01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:21,920
I don't like the way this guy talks.

2949
01:17:21,921 --> 01:17:23,060
He named jobs too much.

2950
01:17:23,061 --> 01:17:23,271
I go,

2951
01:17:23,271 --> 01:17:24,230
I think he's a bullshitter.

2952
01:17:24,650 --> 01:17:25,101
I think there's,

2953
01:17:25,101 --> 01:17:27,860
there's a certain thing that people do
when they bullshit when they talk about

2954
01:17:27,861 --> 01:17:28,300
like,

2955
01:17:28,300 --> 01:17:30,460
I've got a project going on
with Steven Spielberg and this,

2956
01:17:30,470 --> 01:17:33,050
there's just no fucking way Tom
Cruise is passing on the project.

2957
01:17:33,051 --> 01:17:33,831
We want to bring it to you.

2958
01:17:33,831 --> 01:17:34,664
Like,

2959
01:17:35,590 --> 01:17:36,320
you know,

2960
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:36,771
you know what I mean?

2961
01:17:36,771 --> 01:17:37,760
It's like one of those things.

2962
01:17:37,810 --> 01:17:38,070
Sure.

2963
01:17:38,070 --> 01:17:38,630
So the,

2964
01:17:38,630 --> 01:17:38,990
I,

2965
01:17:38,990 --> 01:17:39,350
you know,

2966
01:17:39,350 --> 01:17:40,340
I was peripheral,

2967
01:17:40,460 --> 01:17:41,001
I wasn't,

2968
01:17:41,001 --> 01:17:41,834
you know,

2969
01:17:41,900 --> 01:17:42,711
interacting with sky,

2970
01:17:42,711 --> 01:17:44,030
but Eddie was interacting with this guy.

2971
01:17:44,031 --> 01:17:45,340
I'm like any of that guy's a bullshitter.

2972
01:17:45,380 --> 01:17:46,213
He smells,

2973
01:17:46,280 --> 01:17:46,611
I go,

2974
01:17:46,611 --> 01:17:47,090
I just,

2975
01:17:47,090 --> 01:17:47,923
he just smells.

2976
01:17:48,290 --> 01:17:51,980
So then the guy starts
taking Jujitsu class.

2977
01:17:52,040 --> 01:17:52,670
Okay.

2978
01:17:52,670 --> 01:17:57,670
I mean zero experience in Jujitsu and
then calls Eddie after doing Jujitsu for

2979
01:17:58,521 --> 01:17:58,880
like,

2980
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:00,230
I dunno like a day,

2981
01:18:00,590 --> 01:18:01,550
maybe two days.

2982
01:18:01,551 --> 01:18:04,730
And it's talking about catching people
and triangles and all these different

2983
01:18:04,731 --> 01:18:05,780
submissions that he pulled off,

2984
01:18:06,110 --> 01:18:08,390
which is never going to happen.

2985
01:18:08,630 --> 01:18:10,470
Like it's just not going to happen unless,

2986
01:18:10,550 --> 01:18:14,480
unless you're doing it with someone
who is absolutely physically competent.

2987
01:18:14,780 --> 01:18:15,350
When you,

2988
01:18:15,350 --> 01:18:16,460
when you first start out,

2989
01:18:16,461 --> 01:18:17,480
you don't know what you're doing,

2990
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:18,590
you don't learn that day one.

2991
01:18:18,650 --> 01:18:19,071
We'll also,

2992
01:18:19,071 --> 01:18:20,090
he's not a stud.

2993
01:18:20,210 --> 01:18:21,170
The guy wasn't like,

2994
01:18:21,230 --> 01:18:22,210
there's certain guys like it,

2995
01:18:22,220 --> 01:18:22,721
you can take a guy,

2996
01:18:22,721 --> 01:18:26,450
he's like a pro basketball player who's
just a fucking athlete and maybe he

2997
01:18:26,451 --> 01:18:29,330
loves MMA and maybe he's never
taken a Jujitsu classes life,

2998
01:18:29,331 --> 01:18:33,260
but he's seen a few fights and if he
recognizes the position that you teach it

2999
01:18:33,261 --> 01:18:33,680
to him,

3000
01:18:33,680 --> 01:18:35,570
he could maybe pull it
off on someone who sucks.

3001
01:18:35,590 --> 01:18:35,990
Yeah,

3002
01:18:35,990 --> 01:18:37,670
but it's an advanced move,

3003
01:18:37,671 --> 01:18:38,990
like setting up a triangle,

3004
01:18:38,991 --> 01:18:39,651
finishing it.

3005
01:18:39,651 --> 01:18:40,790
It's an advanced move.

3006
01:18:40,791 --> 01:18:41,624
And this guy was like,

3007
01:18:41,750 --> 01:18:44,540
I got three triangles today and practice
and to armbars when we were like,

3008
01:18:44,541 --> 01:18:44,871
wait,

3009
01:18:44,871 --> 01:18:45,560
what?

3010
01:18:45,560 --> 01:18:46,071
And I go,

3011
01:18:46,071 --> 01:18:48,290
I told you he's a bullshitter.

3012
01:18:48,500 --> 01:18:49,430
And then he go,

3013
01:18:50,060 --> 01:18:50,241
well,

3014
01:18:50,241 --> 01:18:52,100
he did actually go to class.

3015
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:54,830
He did not ever tap anyone ever.

3016
01:18:54,831 --> 01:18:56,570
He is physically in competent.

3017
01:18:56,720 --> 01:18:57,151
Like if you,

3018
01:18:57,151 --> 01:18:58,070
if you see him,

3019
01:18:58,220 --> 01:18:59,240
you look at his body,

3020
01:18:59,241 --> 01:19:03,500
it's like this guy is lucky if he can
brush his teeth like this isn't a fucking

3021
01:19:03,501 --> 01:19:04,520
athlete at all.

3022
01:19:04,521 --> 01:19:05,354
I mean he was just like,

3023
01:19:05,780 --> 01:19:06,920
it was a gumby.

3024
01:19:06,921 --> 01:19:10,400
He was a guy who essentially had never
worked out his whole life and then all of

3025
01:19:10,401 --> 01:19:12,440
a sudden he's claiming he's
tapping people out in Jujitsu.

3026
01:19:12,620 --> 01:19:13,850
But that was just confirmation.

3027
01:19:13,880 --> 01:19:14,211
Then ed,

3028
01:19:14,211 --> 01:19:15,044
he looked into his,

3029
01:19:15,170 --> 01:19:18,220
his whole situation and found out the
guy was just a total complete liar.

3030
01:19:18,530 --> 01:19:19,790
Broke it down with them over the phone.

3031
01:19:20,060 --> 01:19:22,130
There's another one I've got is a guy,

3032
01:19:22,190 --> 01:19:22,521
he,

3033
01:19:22,521 --> 01:19:23,354
his name,

3034
01:19:24,350 --> 01:19:28,730
his real name was Ralph and he was
telling us that his name was Rafael Tori.

3035
01:19:29,270 --> 01:19:29,870
And,

3036
01:19:29,870 --> 01:19:30,260
um,

3037
01:19:30,260 --> 01:19:34,340
he was saying that he was a black belt
in Jujitsu as friends or like how did

3038
01:19:34,341 --> 01:19:34,670
you,

3039
01:19:34,670 --> 01:19:36,260
well this guy I'm telling us,

3040
01:19:36,980 --> 01:19:41,690
he was his friend and he was a journalist
for a mixed martial arts magazine,

3041
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:43,220
an online magazine.

3042
01:19:43,400 --> 01:19:46,550
And so he would go to these events and uh,

3043
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:48,200
and he would do,

3044
01:19:48,201 --> 01:19:48,861
Eddie was a,

3045
01:19:48,861 --> 01:19:50,600
one of the commentators
for the king of the cage,

3046
01:19:50,601 --> 01:19:52,460
which is a smaller mixed martial arts,

3047
01:19:52,461 --> 01:19:56,400
a organization familiar
with King and again and uh,

3048
01:19:56,570 --> 01:19:57,110
anyway,

3049
01:19:57,110 --> 01:20:00,140
Rafael Tory actually had a fake fight.

3050
01:20:00,380 --> 01:20:00,910
I mean he,

3051
01:20:00,910 --> 01:20:02,720
he said that he was a
Brazilian Jiu Jitsu black belt.

3052
01:20:02,721 --> 01:20:03,890
He was not at all.

3053
01:20:03,891 --> 01:20:06,950
Eddie rolled with them and Eddie is a
black belt and at the time I don't think

3054
01:20:07,100 --> 01:20:07,441
was a black,

3055
01:20:07,441 --> 01:20:09,850
but I think Eddie was a brown
belt and he just smashed him,

3056
01:20:09,851 --> 01:20:10,890
just tapped him left and right.

3057
01:20:11,040 --> 01:20:12,480
And he was like confused.

3058
01:20:12,481 --> 01:20:12,811
He was like,

3059
01:20:12,811 --> 01:20:13,360
well maybe they,

3060
01:20:13,360 --> 01:20:16,650
maybe it wasn't really trying or like I
don't get it cause he was a bigger guy

3061
01:20:16,651 --> 01:20:16,930
too.

3062
01:20:16,930 --> 01:20:19,200
It was like way too easy
for Eddie to tap them.

3063
01:20:19,410 --> 01:20:20,081
So Eddie there,

3064
01:20:20,081 --> 01:20:23,040
there was a few like red
flags that popped up there.

3065
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:23,940
Anyway,

3066
01:20:23,940 --> 01:20:25,170
long story short,

3067
01:20:25,860 --> 01:20:27,560
the guy never digits before it,

3068
01:20:27,580 --> 01:20:30,870
it was a complete fake would
disappear and here's a good one.

3069
01:20:31,050 --> 01:20:31,860
Went away.

3070
01:20:31,860 --> 01:20:32,420
Okay.

3071
01:20:32,420 --> 01:20:34,080
It told his friend to drop him off,

3072
01:20:34,200 --> 01:20:36,390
like pulled up to this a wooded area,

3073
01:20:36,391 --> 01:20:37,350
told his friend to drop him off.

3074
01:20:37,351 --> 01:20:40,170
He had a duffle bag with
them filled with some shit,

3075
01:20:40,171 --> 01:20:40,650
right?

3076
01:20:40,650 --> 01:20:41,251
He says,

3077
01:20:41,251 --> 01:20:41,520
uh,

3078
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:42,301
dropped me off here.

3079
01:20:42,301 --> 01:20:47,301
I'm going to fight in this no rules karate
tournament out in the woods and then

3080
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:49,080
I'll be back in two days.

3081
01:20:49,650 --> 01:20:49,921
Okay.

3082
01:20:49,921 --> 01:20:53,540
So his friend comes back in two days and
now he doesn't have the duffle bag in.

3083
01:20:53,550 --> 01:20:58,340
My buddy has a trophy that's the same
size as the fucking duffle bag one.

3084
01:20:58,590 --> 01:21:00,180
This no rules karate tournament.

3085
01:21:00,181 --> 01:21:00,700
I mean,

3086
01:21:00,700 --> 01:21:01,501
and everybody's like,

3087
01:21:01,501 --> 01:21:01,891
wait,

3088
01:21:01,891 --> 01:21:02,724
what the fuck?

3089
01:21:02,940 --> 01:21:03,390
Okay,

3090
01:21:03,390 --> 01:21:07,200
so the guy completely made up is martial
arts background completely made up.

3091
01:21:07,530 --> 01:21:11,430
He also went to Thailand for a
fight and got a guy in a twister.

3092
01:21:11,910 --> 01:21:16,910
Twister is a very complex
move that involves not just
getting on top of Oh God,

3093
01:21:17,481 --> 01:21:19,560
but getting on top of guy inside control,

3094
01:21:19,561 --> 01:21:24,260
lacing one leg with your two
legs rolling on your shoulders.

3095
01:21:24,261 --> 01:21:25,410
So you go behind him,

3096
01:21:25,411 --> 01:21:26,244
take his back,

3097
01:21:26,250 --> 01:21:28,410
you wrap his arm around your head,

3098
01:21:28,590 --> 01:21:31,200
grab his head and Torque his spine.

3099
01:21:31,201 --> 01:21:33,570
It's an incredibly complex maneuver.

3100
01:21:33,720 --> 01:21:37,050
This guy just learned it and he
started pulling it off on people in,

3101
01:21:37,051 --> 01:21:38,790
in a fucking no holds barred fight.

3102
01:21:38,791 --> 01:21:40,200
So there was all these things.

3103
01:21:40,230 --> 01:21:40,920
So Eddie,

3104
01:21:40,920 --> 01:21:42,240
Eddie cuts the guy off and he's like,

3105
01:21:42,241 --> 01:21:43,074
listen man,

3106
01:21:43,110 --> 01:21:44,130
you're bullshit artists.

3107
01:21:44,160 --> 01:21:45,210
I know you're full of shit.

3108
01:21:45,211 --> 01:21:46,500
You're not a fucking black belt.

3109
01:21:46,620 --> 01:21:48,840
You're not fighting in
these fucking fights.

3110
01:21:48,841 --> 01:21:49,860
He just wanted to be near it.

3111
01:21:49,890 --> 01:21:50,130
Yeah,

3112
01:21:50,130 --> 01:21:50,431
he goes,

3113
01:21:50,431 --> 01:21:51,450
I know that your fight.

3114
01:21:51,451 --> 01:21:53,850
But Eddie had been friends with this
guy for months and months and months,

3115
01:21:53,910 --> 01:21:55,740
just slowly piled on the bullshit.

3116
01:21:55,920 --> 01:21:56,161
You know,

3117
01:21:56,161 --> 01:21:57,810
just not trying to investigate a guy,

3118
01:21:57,811 --> 01:21:59,340
just thinking he's a cool guy.

3119
01:21:59,341 --> 01:22:01,350
He was already in the mix
before Eddie got there.

3120
01:22:01,351 --> 01:22:03,990
He was already deepen with
these mixed martial arts guy.

3121
01:22:03,991 --> 01:22:05,910
So he just assumed that a guy's legit.

3122
01:22:06,120 --> 01:22:08,460
Turns out as the time goes on,

3123
01:22:09,420 --> 01:22:10,800
he murdered a guy,

3124
01:22:12,150 --> 01:22:16,290
murdered a guy who was married
to a girl that he was fucking,

3125
01:22:17,730 --> 01:22:22,440
he got close to the guy and I guess he
had like some sort of karate school that

3126
01:22:22,441 --> 01:22:25,350
he was teaching that with
his fake fake martial arts.

3127
01:22:25,710 --> 01:22:26,130
And,

3128
01:22:26,130 --> 01:22:26,370
uh,

3129
01:22:26,370 --> 01:22:27,930
got the guy to come to his school,

3130
01:22:27,931 --> 01:22:28,800
strangled him,

3131
01:22:28,801 --> 01:22:29,634
killed him,

3132
01:22:29,880 --> 01:22:31,770
and then was driving the guy's car,

3133
01:22:31,771 --> 01:22:32,521
Rau witnesses,

3134
01:22:32,521 --> 01:22:34,830
saw him drive the guy's car around and,

3135
01:22:34,890 --> 01:22:35,723
um,

3136
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:40,760
had a gun that he gave to my friend
Gerald and told Gerald to hide it.

3137
01:22:41,340 --> 01:22:42,720
And then Gerald,

3138
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:43,291
you know,

3139
01:22:43,291 --> 01:22:45,570
calls me up and tells
me the whole situation.

3140
01:22:45,571 --> 01:22:46,141
And I was like,

3141
01:22:46,141 --> 01:22:46,710
what?

3142
01:22:46,710 --> 01:22:47,820
What the fuck happened?

3143
01:22:48,120 --> 01:22:48,660
The Guy,

3144
01:22:48,660 --> 01:22:49,493
what did he kills him?

3145
01:22:49,620 --> 01:22:51,120
And then Gerald goes to the cops.

3146
01:22:51,360 --> 01:22:51,751
Okay.

3147
01:22:51,751 --> 01:22:55,830
And then the cops called me
because Gerald had apparently been,

3148
01:22:55,860 --> 01:22:56,693
um,

3149
01:22:56,700 --> 01:23:00,930
they had wiretapped him while all this
was going down because they suspected

3150
01:23:01,170 --> 01:23:01,831
that this guy,

3151
01:23:01,831 --> 01:23:02,371
Raphael,

3152
01:23:02,371 --> 01:23:03,480
his real name was Ralph,

3153
01:23:04,350 --> 01:23:05,380
wasn't resilient of the,

3154
01:23:05,420 --> 01:23:06,580
that's the worst part of the line.

3155
01:23:06,581 --> 01:23:08,830
You said he was Brazilian
and he wasn't Brazilian,

3156
01:23:08,850 --> 01:23:09,111
he'd be,

3157
01:23:09,111 --> 01:23:10,920
he just faked his ethnicity,

3158
01:23:10,930 --> 01:23:12,490
faked his martial arts background,

3159
01:23:13,160 --> 01:23:14,260
and now he's in jail for life.

3160
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:14,891
I mean,

3161
01:23:14,891 --> 01:23:15,310
he's a,

3162
01:23:15,310 --> 01:23:17,660
he's in jail for murder and
a lot of twisters in jail.

3163
01:23:17,880 --> 01:23:19,770
That's what you're saying now,

3164
01:23:19,980 --> 01:23:20,530
but I mean,

3165
01:23:20,530 --> 01:23:21,190
is that not,

3166
01:23:21,190 --> 01:23:23,050
that's the ultimate bullshit.

3167
01:23:23,051 --> 01:23:24,280
Ours fake black belt,

3168
01:23:24,281 --> 01:23:25,180
fake ethnicity,

3169
01:23:25,181 --> 01:23:26,080
fake name.

3170
01:23:26,390 --> 01:23:27,880
The trophy thing is fucking amazing.

3171
01:23:27,881 --> 01:23:28,720
It's hilarious.

3172
01:23:29,120 --> 01:23:30,290
Story is so crazy.

3173
01:23:30,500 --> 01:23:32,480
It makes you sound crazy
when you're telling me

3174
01:23:32,520 --> 01:23:32,940
yes,

3175
01:23:32,940 --> 01:23:33,773
it does.

3176
01:23:34,290 --> 01:23:34,411
Well,

3177
01:23:34,411 --> 01:23:35,340
you can look the guy up.

3178
01:23:35,341 --> 01:23:35,911
Google the guy,

3179
01:23:35,911 --> 01:23:36,451
Rafael,

3180
01:23:36,451 --> 01:23:36,960
Tori,

3181
01:23:36,960 --> 01:23:37,793
I mean it's uh,

3182
01:23:37,800 --> 01:23:40,920
it's an incredible story that gets
passed back and forth through,

3183
01:23:40,921 --> 01:23:41,370
uh,

3184
01:23:41,370 --> 01:23:42,570
the mixed martial arts world.

3185
01:23:42,690 --> 01:23:46,110
But the point is that before the Internet,

3186
01:23:46,111 --> 01:23:46,621
I mean this was,

3187
01:23:46,621 --> 01:23:49,710
there was websites back then and
there was martial arts websites.

3188
01:23:49,711 --> 01:23:50,910
It was like 2000,

3189
01:23:50,940 --> 01:23:53,040
I want to say like two or
three or something like that.

3190
01:23:53,340 --> 01:23:58,110
But you couldn't like Google the guy
you could like find out the guy's

3191
01:23:58,111 --> 01:23:58,741
background.

3192
01:23:58,741 --> 01:23:58,951
Right,

3193
01:23:58,951 --> 01:23:59,091
right,

3194
01:23:59,091 --> 01:23:59,250
right.

3195
01:23:59,250 --> 01:24:02,450
Like if you Google Eliza
slutching anger that I said,

3196
01:24:02,510 --> 01:24:02,990
I say it right.

3197
01:24:02,990 --> 01:24:04,170
There is no such objection.

3198
01:24:04,230 --> 01:24:07,110
The metal singer hi saying
yet assessing right now.

3199
01:24:07,111 --> 01:24:07,771
How do you say it's it?

3200
01:24:07,771 --> 01:24:08,600
Right?

3201
01:24:08,600 --> 01:24:10,710
Well I've been saying
slushing juror forever.

3202
01:24:11,030 --> 01:24:15,480
[inaudible] Shlesinger slashing
Gersh less singer Schlesinger.

3203
01:24:15,990 --> 01:24:17,070
I'll never say it wrong again.

3204
01:24:17,100 --> 01:24:17,490
Eliza.

3205
01:24:17,490 --> 01:24:17,910
Slash.

3206
01:24:17,910 --> 01:24:18,500
Anger.

3207
01:24:18,500 --> 01:24:19,560
You're going to say it wrong every time.

3208
01:24:20,100 --> 01:24:20,530
Every time.

3209
01:24:20,530 --> 01:24:20,871
I'm not one,

3210
01:24:20,871 --> 01:24:22,590
it will be wrong just as
it's been in the past.

3211
01:24:23,620 --> 01:24:25,860
And that was going to call you Eliza
cause that's your Twitter handle.

3212
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:27,240
That's who you are to me.

3213
01:24:28,050 --> 01:24:29,160
But if I Google you,

3214
01:24:29,161 --> 01:24:30,960
I find out about last comic standing.

3215
01:24:30,961 --> 01:24:34,440
I see pictures of you topless on the beach
with two guys holding their arms over

3216
01:24:34,441 --> 01:24:35,160
your titties.

3217
01:24:35,160 --> 01:24:36,060
I see a lot of things.

3218
01:24:36,180 --> 01:24:36,691
I've seen it.

3219
01:24:36,691 --> 01:24:37,650
It's on my message board.

3220
01:24:38,220 --> 01:24:38,401
Yeah,

3221
01:24:38,401 --> 01:24:39,450
this is Raphael Tori,

3222
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:42,750
the guy on the left hand side with the
guy on the right hand side with the

3223
01:24:42,760 --> 01:24:45,360
glasses is Tito motherfucking Ortiz.

3224
01:24:45,420 --> 01:24:47,670
Former world champion of the UFC.

3225
01:24:47,730 --> 01:24:48,563
So this guy,

3226
01:24:49,110 --> 01:24:49,471
this guy,

3227
01:24:49,471 --> 01:24:50,880
but this guy got in deep,

3228
01:24:50,940 --> 01:24:52,170
that guy on the left,

3229
01:24:52,380 --> 01:24:54,810
not the guy without the red in his jacket.

3230
01:24:54,840 --> 01:24:55,673
The guy on,

3231
01:24:56,170 --> 01:24:57,900
it's his left,

3232
01:24:58,050 --> 01:24:58,650
right.

3233
01:24:58,650 --> 01:24:59,700
You are right.

3234
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:00,750
This is so complicated.

3235
01:25:01,090 --> 01:25:02,010
Flyer is the one,

3236
01:25:02,011 --> 01:25:02,191
yeah,

3237
01:25:02,191 --> 01:25:04,170
the guy in the right hand
side of the photograph.

3238
01:25:04,470 --> 01:25:05,340
The guy with the mustache.

3239
01:25:05,341 --> 01:25:05,551
Yes.

3240
01:25:05,551 --> 01:25:05,851
Thank you.

3241
01:25:05,851 --> 01:25:06,300
There we go.

3242
01:25:06,300 --> 01:25:07,290
The guy without the glasses.

3243
01:25:07,470 --> 01:25:08,480
That's Rafael Torres.

3244
01:25:08,490 --> 01:25:11,580
He's in jail for murder and he's
a fake black belt and he's uh,

3245
01:25:11,610 --> 01:25:13,260
you know everything about his fake,

3246
01:25:13,261 --> 01:25:14,160
his names fake.

3247
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:17,260
And that guy like got deep,

3248
01:25:17,261 --> 01:25:17,471
deep,

3249
01:25:17,471 --> 01:25:20,530
deep in the martial arts world as a fraud.

3250
01:25:20,860 --> 01:25:21,850
That's so crazy.

3251
01:25:21,910 --> 01:25:22,743
Fascinating.

3252
01:25:23,020 --> 01:25:23,320
Also,

3253
01:25:23,320 --> 01:25:23,531
I mean,

3254
01:25:23,531 --> 01:25:24,730
I guess you,

3255
01:25:24,731 --> 01:25:27,040
and you want to ask Kevin
as I asked the ex boyfriend,

3256
01:25:27,041 --> 01:25:27,290
I was like,

3257
01:25:27,290 --> 01:25:28,960
what was your end game here buddy?

3258
01:25:29,080 --> 01:25:32,050
Did you have a conversation with him
after this or was it just email and that's

3259
01:25:32,051 --> 01:25:32,231
it.

3260
01:25:32,231 --> 01:25:32,891
Did you talk,

3261
01:25:32,891 --> 01:25:33,161
talk?

3262
01:25:33,161 --> 01:25:33,910
He texted any,

3263
01:25:33,910 --> 01:25:34,360
I mean,

3264
01:25:34,360 --> 01:25:35,170
he apologize.

3265
01:25:35,170 --> 01:25:36,490
This wasn't like poof.

3266
01:25:36,491 --> 01:25:36,761
I'm gone.

3267
01:25:36,761 --> 01:25:37,421
Like there's a lot of,

3268
01:25:37,421 --> 01:25:37,721
you know.

3269
01:25:37,721 --> 01:25:40,350
But did you think about
like keeping a Morag?

3270
01:25:40,370 --> 01:25:40,810
Could it?

3271
01:25:40,810 --> 01:25:44,200
No way I couldn't because like
you have to take yourself,

3272
01:25:44,201 --> 01:25:44,500
I mean,

3273
01:25:44,500 --> 01:25:44,831
I even,

3274
01:25:44,831 --> 01:25:45,360
I knew this,

3275
01:25:45,360 --> 01:25:47,330
you have to take yourself out of like you,

3276
01:25:47,420 --> 01:25:49,030
your hurt and your heart's broken.

3277
01:25:49,300 --> 01:25:50,530
You're allowed to let that heal.

3278
01:25:50,680 --> 01:25:52,570
But getting back with
someone like that is not,

3279
01:25:52,571 --> 01:25:52,931
first of all,

3280
01:25:52,931 --> 01:25:56,980
I lose respect from my all my friends
and family and it also like you can't

3281
01:25:56,981 --> 01:25:57,814
trust that person.

3282
01:25:57,940 --> 01:26:00,630
The end game for you is that you'd be
dating someone you couldn't trust however.

3283
01:26:00,780 --> 01:26:01,540
Um,

3284
01:26:01,540 --> 01:26:02,171
but I as you know,

3285
01:26:02,171 --> 01:26:02,930
and he just,

3286
01:26:02,930 --> 01:26:03,440
and never,

3287
01:26:03,440 --> 01:26:04,041
that's the other thing.

3288
01:26:04,041 --> 01:26:05,060
And I said in the email,

3289
01:26:05,270 --> 01:26:05,601
I was like,

3290
01:26:05,601 --> 01:26:05,831
I'm,

3291
01:26:05,831 --> 01:26:07,310
I don't have all the answers from him.

3292
01:26:07,640 --> 01:26:07,911
I said,

3293
01:26:07,911 --> 01:26:12,590
I'm willing to trade my lack of closure
for the privilege of never having to

3294
01:26:12,591 --> 01:26:13,424
talk to you again.

3295
01:26:13,810 --> 01:26:15,140
So I will write my own closure.

3296
01:26:15,141 --> 01:26:16,190
I'll draw my own conclusions.

3297
01:26:16,220 --> 01:26:17,450
I won't defend you to anyone.

3298
01:26:18,740 --> 01:26:20,330
And he went down on me for 20 minutes

3299
01:26:23,360 --> 01:26:24,193
outside,

3300
01:26:24,430 --> 01:26:27,260
outside to danger pussy.

3301
01:26:28,860 --> 01:26:30,070
That's so crazy that,

3302
01:26:30,071 --> 01:26:30,191
that,

3303
01:26:30,191 --> 01:26:32,160
that the lack of closure
thing is a big thing.

3304
01:26:32,161 --> 01:26:32,341
Right.

3305
01:26:32,341 --> 01:26:33,630
Cause you'll stay up late,

3306
01:26:33,850 --> 01:26:34,830
try to figure it out.

3307
01:26:35,160 --> 01:26:37,290
Do you like find yourself
like during the day,

3308
01:26:37,291 --> 01:26:38,860
like just driving around
and trying to piece it

3309
01:26:38,890 --> 01:26:39,210
together?

3310
01:26:39,210 --> 01:26:39,490
Yeah.

3311
01:26:39,490 --> 01:26:40,180
Where did,

3312
01:26:40,180 --> 01:26:41,290
I was sitting on the plane yesterday.

3313
01:26:41,291 --> 01:26:42,124
And like it,

3314
01:26:42,360 --> 01:26:43,900
especially when you just
go through a breakup,

3315
01:26:43,901 --> 01:26:44,230
like you're,

3316
01:26:44,230 --> 01:26:44,411
you know,

3317
01:26:44,411 --> 01:26:45,520
you think about that person,

3318
01:26:45,550 --> 01:26:46,360
whatever.

3319
01:26:46,360 --> 01:26:47,380
And the hard thing is not,

3320
01:26:47,530 --> 01:26:48,370
I'm past that phase.

3321
01:26:48,570 --> 01:26:49,100
There's no I,

3322
01:26:49,100 --> 01:26:49,960
the number's blocked.

3323
01:26:49,961 --> 01:26:51,220
Like I can't call him or anything.

3324
01:26:51,880 --> 01:26:52,271
But yeah,

3325
01:26:52,271 --> 01:26:54,790
you sit there and you go back
over things and then I start like,

3326
01:26:54,791 --> 01:26:57,430
here's a weird piece of the puzzle if
you want to know what I was thinking.

3327
01:26:58,060 --> 01:26:58,893
Um,

3328
01:26:59,080 --> 01:27:00,460
when before we were dating,

3329
01:27:00,880 --> 01:27:03,670
he invited me to go to England for the
skull and bones thing and obviously not

3330
01:27:03,671 --> 01:27:04,121
in skull and bones.

3331
01:27:04,121 --> 01:27:04,954
You didn't go to Yale.

3332
01:27:05,350 --> 01:27:06,340
And even after this all happened,

3333
01:27:06,341 --> 01:27:06,521
he goes,

3334
01:27:06,521 --> 01:27:06,611
well,

3335
01:27:06,611 --> 01:27:07,990
my dad was in skull
and bones and I'm like,

3336
01:27:07,991 --> 01:27:09,790
your dad went to Yale Grad school,

3337
01:27:09,850 --> 01:27:10,690
what's his name?

3338
01:27:10,930 --> 01:27:12,010
What's Your Dad's name?

3339
01:27:12,060 --> 01:27:13,420
Dad's dead in real life.

3340
01:27:13,420 --> 01:27:14,350
That's what I mean that for.

3341
01:27:14,410 --> 01:27:15,570
But uh,

3342
01:27:15,820 --> 01:27:16,990
he invited me to go to England,

3343
01:27:17,080 --> 01:27:22,080
so I was going to go separate rooms and
I went out to dinner with a friend who

3344
01:27:22,630 --> 01:27:23,890
has a body that I really liked.

3345
01:27:23,891 --> 01:27:28,240
So I took a picture of my drink and in
the background was my friend's body.

3346
01:27:28,270 --> 01:27:29,200
He's like a big guy,

3347
01:27:29,530 --> 01:27:30,910
so the point of the
picture was to be like,

3348
01:27:30,940 --> 01:27:33,810
look at this hot thing I'm having a
drink with not so much to be like,

3349
01:27:33,811 --> 01:27:34,644
look at the drink.

3350
01:27:35,290 --> 01:27:39,010
I think he saw that picture because I
don't remember if it was before or after,

3351
01:27:39,011 --> 01:27:41,170
but that was the night
he called me and said,

3352
01:27:41,230 --> 01:27:42,011
we can't go to England.

3353
01:27:42,011 --> 01:27:42,844
My mom has cancer.

3354
01:27:43,720 --> 01:27:46,240
I think he saw that picture
on Instagram and he was like,

3355
01:27:46,241 --> 01:27:48,850
I got to do something
to shake this up if the,

3356
01:27:48,851 --> 01:27:50,110
if the mom doesn't have cancer.

3357
01:27:50,111 --> 01:27:52,090
It's odd that that was
the night of all nights.

3358
01:27:52,500 --> 01:27:55,500
So you were friends only
up until that point.

3359
01:27:55,530 --> 01:27:56,190
Yeah.

3360
01:27:56,190 --> 01:27:57,090
Let me tell you something.

3361
01:27:57,120 --> 01:28:02,120
There's friends and there's friends with
an agenda and you and I are friends.

3362
01:28:02,671 --> 01:28:03,990
We will never have sex.

3363
01:28:04,020 --> 01:28:04,920
I'll tell you that right now.

3364
01:28:04,980 --> 01:28:05,640
I'm married,

3365
01:28:05,640 --> 01:28:06,390
we're friends.

3366
01:28:06,390 --> 01:28:07,890
I'm not going to let it happen.

3367
01:28:07,960 --> 01:28:10,020
Eliza stopped with those eyes,

3368
01:28:12,270 --> 01:28:12,901
but you know what I'm saying?

3369
01:28:12,901 --> 01:28:14,250
Like we're legitimate friends.

3370
01:28:14,280 --> 01:28:15,300
Amy Schumer's another one.

3371
01:28:15,390 --> 01:28:17,490
She's my legitimate friends and I,

3372
01:28:17,550 --> 01:28:17,971
you know,

3373
01:28:17,971 --> 01:28:21,750
I think it's very important to
like have men and women like that,

3374
01:28:21,751 --> 01:28:22,770
that are friends like that.

3375
01:28:22,771 --> 01:28:25,110
There's like a line that
will never be crossed.

3376
01:28:25,170 --> 01:28:26,130
It's like you can't,

3377
01:28:26,490 --> 01:28:29,520
but there's guys who are really
never your fucking friend.

3378
01:28:29,550 --> 01:28:30,091
Never,

3379
01:28:30,091 --> 01:28:30,451
ever,

3380
01:28:30,451 --> 01:28:30,781
ever,

3381
01:28:30,781 --> 01:28:31,171
ever,

3382
01:28:31,171 --> 01:28:31,501
ever.

3383
01:28:31,501 --> 01:28:32,220
It's done.

3384
01:28:32,220 --> 01:28:34,080
The whole thing was a
lie from the beginning.

3385
01:28:34,510 --> 01:28:37,370
I knew that like I'm not dumb
and he had said that to me.

3386
01:28:37,371 --> 01:28:37,571
He's like,

3387
01:28:37,571 --> 01:28:39,160
goes over your friend but you,

3388
01:28:39,161 --> 01:28:40,390
he was someone that I,

3389
01:28:40,450 --> 01:28:40,780
we had,

3390
01:28:40,780 --> 01:28:44,110
we hung out and we had a really nice
like relationship his friends and

3391
01:28:44,111 --> 01:28:46,150
definitely I would get drunk
once in a while and I'd be like,

3392
01:28:46,151 --> 01:28:46,901
let's make out.

3393
01:28:46,901 --> 01:28:47,980
Like that's like a girl thing.

3394
01:28:47,981 --> 01:28:49,470
But it was never what,

3395
01:28:49,930 --> 01:28:50,763
hold on.

3396
01:28:50,980 --> 01:28:54,400
You would get drunk and say let's make
out like I would kiss him and like go

3397
01:28:54,401 --> 01:28:55,690
inside a big deal.

3398
01:28:55,910 --> 01:28:56,110
What?

3399
01:28:56,110 --> 01:28:57,370
Kiss him like tongue and everything.

3400
01:28:57,371 --> 01:28:58,060
The whole deal.

3401
01:28:58,060 --> 01:28:58,661
Like a drunk,

3402
01:28:58,661 --> 01:29:00,910
make out kiss fully clothed
and then like go inside.

3403
01:29:01,260 --> 01:29:01,920
Whoa.

3404
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:02,910
That's so girl.

3405
01:29:03,110 --> 01:29:03,650
It's so gross.

3406
01:29:03,650 --> 01:29:04,331
So crazy.

3407
01:29:04,331 --> 01:29:05,011
I also said,

3408
01:29:05,011 --> 01:29:05,850
I would say to him,

3409
01:29:05,970 --> 01:29:06,271
I'm like,

3410
01:29:06,271 --> 01:29:07,680
look at any point,

3411
01:29:07,800 --> 01:29:09,000
and I'm very upfront on us.

3412
01:29:09,030 --> 01:29:11,820
I'd say at any point we
can stop hanging out.

3413
01:29:11,850 --> 01:29:12,091
I go,

3414
01:29:12,091 --> 01:29:13,170
I'm never going to date you.

3415
01:29:13,350 --> 01:29:14,220
You need to know that.

3416
01:29:14,910 --> 01:29:15,300
And He,

3417
01:29:15,300 --> 01:29:15,750
meanwhile,

3418
01:29:15,750 --> 01:29:17,430
you dated him eventually,

3419
01:29:17,440 --> 01:29:17,830
but,

3420
01:29:17,830 --> 01:29:18,610
but,

3421
01:29:18,610 --> 01:29:19,470
but my point is,

3422
01:29:19,890 --> 01:29:20,850
the whole time we were dating,

3423
01:29:20,851 --> 01:29:21,511
I was honest.

3424
01:29:21,511 --> 01:29:21,751
I was like,

3425
01:29:21,751 --> 01:29:23,030
I have no intention of dating you.

3426
01:29:23,060 --> 01:29:23,210
Yeah,

3427
01:29:23,210 --> 01:29:24,900
but you kissed him ton.

3428
01:29:25,230 --> 01:29:26,130
You can walk away.

3429
01:29:26,131 --> 01:29:28,380
I didn't chain him to
the wall and I was like,

3430
01:29:28,381 --> 01:29:29,610
I'm going to date other guys.

3431
01:29:29,850 --> 01:29:31,350
I'm going to have other guys be my boy.

3432
01:29:31,380 --> 01:29:32,850
Like not when I was kissing him,

3433
01:29:32,851 --> 01:29:33,420
but I was like,

3434
01:29:33,420 --> 01:29:34,650
I'm probably never going to date you.

3435
01:29:34,770 --> 01:29:35,603
Right.

3436
01:29:35,760 --> 01:29:36,630
And he hung around.

3437
01:29:36,730 --> 01:29:37,001
Well,

3438
01:29:37,001 --> 01:29:37,141
I,

3439
01:29:37,141 --> 01:29:38,320
and I understand that.

3440
01:29:38,350 --> 01:29:39,183
I mean,

3441
01:29:39,430 --> 01:29:39,791
well,

3442
01:29:39,791 --> 01:29:41,980
he's definitely a silly
man for hanging around,

3443
01:29:41,981 --> 01:29:43,870
but not because he
eventually got to fuck you.

3444
01:29:44,020 --> 01:29:44,860
So he wins,

3445
01:29:45,520 --> 01:29:46,353
I guess.

3446
01:29:46,630 --> 01:29:47,463
I don't think really.

3447
01:29:47,470 --> 01:29:47,741
Oh,

3448
01:29:47,741 --> 01:29:48,010
neat.

3449
01:29:48,010 --> 01:29:48,221
Well,

3450
01:29:48,221 --> 01:29:48,790
listen again,

3451
01:29:48,790 --> 01:29:49,623
because you're a girl.

3452
01:29:49,660 --> 01:29:49,961
Listen,

3453
01:29:49,961 --> 01:29:50,740
you kissed him.

3454
01:29:50,740 --> 01:29:50,991
You,

3455
01:29:50,991 --> 01:29:52,150
you tongued him.

3456
01:29:52,180 --> 01:29:54,130
And he eventually got in there.

3457
01:29:54,360 --> 01:29:57,220
But you're telling me that every girl
you've brought prior to being married,

3458
01:29:57,221 --> 01:29:59,620
every girl you ever like drunk made
out with that meant something to you?

3459
01:29:59,690 --> 01:29:59,891
No,

3460
01:29:59,891 --> 01:30:00,041
no,

3461
01:30:00,041 --> 01:30:00,300
no.

3462
01:30:00,300 --> 01:30:03,610
But I think there's a difference
between you saying to someone,

3463
01:30:03,611 --> 01:30:04,000
look,

3464
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:04,511
first of all,

3465
01:30:04,511 --> 01:30:05,080
I'm a man.

3466
01:30:05,080 --> 01:30:07,000
When a man drunkenly
makes out with a girl,

3467
01:30:07,001 --> 01:30:08,300
he absolutely wants to fuck her.

3468
01:30:08,440 --> 01:30:10,810
If a girl drunkenly makes out with a guy,

3469
01:30:10,811 --> 01:30:12,280
she can do it just to be silly,

3470
01:30:12,281 --> 01:30:12,791
I guess.

3471
01:30:12,791 --> 01:30:14,140
And then just shut the door and go in.

3472
01:30:14,310 --> 01:30:14,830
Yeah.

3473
01:30:14,830 --> 01:30:16,000
Guys don't ever do that.

3474
01:30:16,020 --> 01:30:16,540
That's okay.

3475
01:30:16,540 --> 01:30:18,520
If a guide drunkenly
makes out with a girl,

3476
01:30:18,521 --> 01:30:20,800
it's almost always because he eventually,

3477
01:30:20,801 --> 01:30:22,090
ultimately wants to have sex with her.

3478
01:30:22,790 --> 01:30:23,120
But,

3479
01:30:23,120 --> 01:30:23,301
but,

3480
01:30:23,301 --> 01:30:23,481
um,

3481
01:30:23,481 --> 01:30:24,314
but that's,

3482
01:30:24,560 --> 01:30:26,390
that's how guys are and
that's not how girls are.

3483
01:30:26,391 --> 01:30:28,820
And I think all any girl
would relate to that.

3484
01:30:28,821 --> 01:30:29,271
Like you get,

3485
01:30:29,271 --> 01:30:29,571
you know,

3486
01:30:29,571 --> 01:30:30,404
or you're just,

3487
01:30:31,220 --> 01:30:31,431
I mean,

3488
01:30:31,431 --> 01:30:33,170
you're drunk and you want to,

3489
01:30:33,320 --> 01:30:34,820
sometimes you just want
to make out with someone.

3490
01:30:35,530 --> 01:30:36,710
And that's the God's honest truth.

3491
01:30:36,711 --> 01:30:38,930
Like we all get horny and I don't
feel like having that goes x.

3492
01:30:39,530 --> 01:30:40,430
Here's my point though.

3493
01:30:41,210 --> 01:30:43,460
No matter what relationship
you're conducting,

3494
01:30:44,090 --> 01:30:46,190
even like even if you feel
I'm throwing mixed signals,

3495
01:30:46,220 --> 01:30:48,140
you at any point are allowed to walk away.

3496
01:30:48,420 --> 01:30:49,340
At no point was I like,

3497
01:30:49,341 --> 01:30:49,791
I love you.

3498
01:30:49,791 --> 01:30:50,660
Please stay.

3499
01:30:50,661 --> 01:30:51,381
It was me being like,

3500
01:30:51,381 --> 01:30:52,640
I'm going to make out with you.

3501
01:30:52,820 --> 01:30:53,720
Maybe I'll take my shirt off.

3502
01:30:53,750 --> 01:30:54,710
I'm not going to date you.

3503
01:30:54,800 --> 01:30:56,660
Maybe I'll go take my shirt off.

3504
01:30:58,670 --> 01:31:00,050
But this one,

3505
01:31:00,080 --> 01:31:01,380
the whole time they will.

3506
01:31:01,381 --> 01:31:04,550
I started from day one so it isn't
as if like they came into play later,

3507
01:31:04,551 --> 01:31:07,820
like the whole time and then
I think what he was like,

3508
01:31:07,821 --> 01:31:09,830
what happened is I lied
and I know what to do.

3509
01:31:09,831 --> 01:31:10,071
He's like,

3510
01:31:10,071 --> 01:31:10,851
I didn't think we would date.

3511
01:31:10,851 --> 01:31:12,230
You always told us and
told me we wouldn't.

3512
01:31:12,231 --> 01:31:12,891
And then we did.

3513
01:31:12,891 --> 01:31:13,131
He's like,

3514
01:31:13,131 --> 01:31:14,060
I didn't know what to do.

3515
01:31:14,061 --> 01:31:14,894
And I'm like,

3516
01:31:15,290 --> 01:31:15,501
hold on,

3517
01:31:15,501 --> 01:31:16,334
it's on you.

3518
01:31:16,710 --> 01:31:19,410
Well that's definitely on him
and the lies are unacceptable.

3519
01:31:19,411 --> 01:31:19,920
I just,

3520
01:31:19,920 --> 01:31:24,920
all I'm trying to do is as your friend
breakdown though the mindset and try to

3521
01:31:25,981 --> 01:31:28,470
figure out like how someone says,

3522
01:31:28,760 --> 01:31:31,770
I will tongue you and kiss
you and take my shirt off.

3523
01:31:31,771 --> 01:31:33,960
But we're never going to have
sex for a guy that's like,

3524
01:31:33,961 --> 01:31:35,250
if we're getting that close,

3525
01:31:35,280 --> 01:31:37,650
if your tits are coming out
and my tongue's in your mouth.

3526
01:31:37,680 --> 01:31:37,790
Okay.

3527
01:31:37,790 --> 01:31:38,620
Jets.

3528
01:31:38,620 --> 01:31:39,590
I was joking about the shirt thing.

3529
01:31:39,620 --> 01:31:39,730
Oh,

3530
01:31:39,730 --> 01:31:40,280
okay.

3531
01:31:40,280 --> 01:31:41,113
Uh,

3532
01:31:41,120 --> 01:31:41,661
I don't think,

3533
01:31:41,661 --> 01:31:42,680
I think everybody's been there.

3534
01:31:42,681 --> 01:31:46,040
Words like a drunk make out to the
end of the night and you're just like,

3535
01:31:46,041 --> 01:31:46,401
whatever.

3536
01:31:46,401 --> 01:31:47,870
I feel like making out.

3537
01:31:48,260 --> 01:31:49,100
And so you do like,

3538
01:31:49,101 --> 01:31:51,160
you like I know this person and
this is fine and they're like,

3539
01:31:51,470 --> 01:31:53,040
I ever totally support

3540
01:31:53,040 --> 01:31:53,700
your,

3541
01:31:53,700 --> 01:31:58,020
your right to make out with people
and you're drunk and have like a very

3542
01:31:58,021 --> 01:32:00,490
specific boundary where it's not
going to go any further than this.

3543
01:32:00,491 --> 01:32:02,020
We're never going to date and not,

3544
01:32:02,021 --> 01:32:02,920
but if you want to make out,

3545
01:32:02,950 --> 01:32:03,910
I'll make out with you right now.

3546
01:32:03,911 --> 01:32:04,511
But that's it.

3547
01:32:04,511 --> 01:32:05,110
And then that's it.

3548
01:32:05,110 --> 01:32:06,520
That's your prerogative.

3549
01:32:06,521 --> 01:32:07,960
100% this on your show.

3550
01:32:08,010 --> 01:32:08,690
We did.

3551
01:32:08,690 --> 01:32:11,120
I mean like a long time ago where I will,

3552
01:32:11,121 --> 01:32:11,600
if I'm like,

3553
01:32:11,600 --> 01:32:12,560
let's say I'm seeing someone,

3554
01:32:12,620 --> 01:32:14,210
and let's say it's like the
second date or something,

3555
01:32:14,360 --> 01:32:15,980
I will straight up say to a guy,

3556
01:32:16,400 --> 01:32:18,050
I'm not gonna Sleep with you just yet.

3557
01:32:18,051 --> 01:32:18,740
Like I don't,

3558
01:32:18,740 --> 01:32:19,610
I'm not going to do that.

3559
01:32:20,090 --> 01:32:21,320
But if you wanna go upstairs,

3560
01:32:22,010 --> 01:32:23,780
we can make out among your wiener,

3561
01:32:24,260 --> 01:32:24,951
I'll take my shirt off.

3562
01:32:24,951 --> 01:32:25,784
That is a treat for you.

3563
01:32:25,960 --> 01:32:26,793
Great.

3564
01:32:27,240 --> 01:32:28,860
Tomorrow you'll buy me breakfast.

3565
01:32:29,240 --> 01:32:30,810
And no one has ever said no.

3566
01:32:31,020 --> 01:32:34,170
When you give men certain boundaries
of parameters ahead of time,

3567
01:32:34,900 --> 01:32:36,780
and then I'm giving you
the option to say I'm good,

3568
01:32:36,781 --> 01:32:37,501
or I'm tired,

3569
01:32:37,501 --> 01:32:38,070
or I think I'm gonna,

3570
01:32:38,070 --> 01:32:38,880
I'm gonna go home.

3571
01:32:38,880 --> 01:32:39,780
Whatever you want.

3572
01:32:39,990 --> 01:32:41,280
That way you're not disappointed.

3573
01:32:41,281 --> 01:32:42,330
No one's ever pushed it.

3574
01:32:42,810 --> 01:32:45,150
No one's ever tried to get me
to do more than wanting to do.

3575
01:32:45,151 --> 01:32:46,160
And no one's ever said no.

3576
01:32:46,260 --> 01:32:46,381
Well,

3577
01:32:46,381 --> 01:32:48,000
you're a very strong personality.

3578
01:32:48,030 --> 01:32:48,481
You know?

3579
01:32:48,481 --> 01:32:49,710
And if you say that,

3580
01:32:49,730 --> 01:32:49,801
uh,

3581
01:32:49,801 --> 01:32:50,634
guys,

3582
01:32:50,810 --> 01:32:52,740
I'm not saying every guy would respect it,

3583
01:32:52,741 --> 01:32:53,970
but most guys who go,

3584
01:32:53,971 --> 01:32:54,930
she's not fucking around.

3585
01:32:54,931 --> 01:32:55,081
Like,

3586
01:32:55,081 --> 01:32:56,040
this is what she wants.

3587
01:32:56,041 --> 01:32:58,680
And it's better than nothing
for a lot of guys that like,

3588
01:32:58,681 --> 01:32:59,150
wow,

3589
01:32:59,150 --> 01:32:59,940
it's better than nothing.

3590
01:32:59,940 --> 01:33:00,140
Yeah,

3591
01:33:00,140 --> 01:33:02,680
we'll go make out and
squeeze them titties date.

3592
01:33:02,800 --> 01:33:02,910
Yeah.

3593
01:33:02,910 --> 01:33:03,570
That's great.

3594
01:33:03,570 --> 01:33:04,050
Yeah.

3595
01:33:04,050 --> 01:33:05,460
And then eventually we'll fuck.

3596
01:33:05,850 --> 01:33:06,571
So it's like,

3597
01:33:06,571 --> 01:33:06,870
yeah,

3598
01:33:06,870 --> 01:33:07,081
yeah.

3599
01:33:07,081 --> 01:33:09,030
Well there's nothing wrong with
that because also we're talking to,

3600
01:33:09,031 --> 01:33:12,570
if I was a girl also it would
be really difficult for me,

3601
01:33:12,960 --> 01:33:15,480
I assume to just trust a man.

3602
01:33:15,510 --> 01:33:16,560
Like physically,

3603
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:17,311
like there's the,

3604
01:33:17,311 --> 01:33:18,630
the physical thing.

3605
01:33:18,780 --> 01:33:18,961
Like,

3606
01:33:18,961 --> 01:33:19,380
look,

3607
01:33:19,380 --> 01:33:20,460
you had this guy,

3608
01:33:20,610 --> 01:33:22,230
you knew him for a fucking year,

3609
01:33:22,350 --> 01:33:25,260
you dated him for three months and
he turned out to be a complete total

3610
01:33:25,261 --> 01:33:25,631
bullshit.

3611
01:33:25,631 --> 01:33:26,130
Ours.

3612
01:33:26,130 --> 01:33:27,060
What if it was,

3613
01:33:27,300 --> 01:33:28,620
you knew him for a year,

3614
01:33:28,710 --> 01:33:31,620
you date him for three months and he
turned out to be a fucking psychopath and

3615
01:33:31,621 --> 01:33:32,920
you didn't know the
whole time you were date.

3616
01:33:32,921 --> 01:33:33,820
Well it sort of right,

3617
01:33:33,830 --> 01:33:34,080
but I mean,

3618
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:35,310
what if it's the whole
time you were dating,

3619
01:33:35,311 --> 01:33:37,110
he was raping girls
while you weren't around.

3620
01:33:37,111 --> 01:33:37,610
I mean,

3621
01:33:37,610 --> 01:33:41,340
that's just as possible
as him faking Yale.

3622
01:33:41,460 --> 01:33:44,550
He could have been a serial rapist
or house right now with a gun.

3623
01:33:44,551 --> 01:33:45,750
Like he could be a total fucking,

3624
01:33:45,760 --> 01:33:46,090
yeah.

3625
01:33:46,090 --> 01:33:46,890
Yeah.

3626
01:33:46,890 --> 01:33:47,521
Did he have a key?

3627
01:33:47,521 --> 01:33:48,630
I don't at any point in time

3628
01:33:48,940 --> 01:33:51,370
he did like from the only thing that,

3629
01:33:51,760 --> 01:33:53,020
because we'd known each other for a year.

3630
01:33:53,021 --> 01:33:55,330
So when you know someone
for a year and then date,

3631
01:33:55,360 --> 01:33:56,530
it's a little,

3632
01:33:56,531 --> 01:33:58,960
you could take it a little bit faster
because it isn't like you just started

3633
01:33:58,961 --> 01:33:59,141
dating.

3634
01:33:59,141 --> 01:34:00,700
I've nowhere but like a month.

3635
01:34:00,701 --> 01:34:01,061
And he's like,

3636
01:34:01,061 --> 01:34:02,110
I'd love to move in.

3637
01:34:02,111 --> 01:34:03,550
Like what can we move in together?

3638
01:34:03,830 --> 01:34:06,670
And I've definitely dated guys that like
to go fast and you've got to like pump

3639
01:34:06,671 --> 01:34:07,504
the brakes.

3640
01:34:07,570 --> 01:34:08,220
And now I'm like,

3641
01:34:08,220 --> 01:34:08,870
okay,

3642
01:34:08,870 --> 01:34:09,760
I'm the one computer.

3643
01:34:09,770 --> 01:34:10,670
Great Guy.

3644
01:34:10,940 --> 01:34:12,500
You're the Guy Alive.

3645
01:34:12,530 --> 01:34:13,880
I always go along with it too.

3646
01:34:14,270 --> 01:34:14,820
Yeah,

3647
01:34:14,820 --> 01:34:15,240
I'm on it.

3648
01:34:15,240 --> 01:34:15,681
Cause I'm like,

3649
01:34:15,681 --> 01:34:15,831
yeah,

3650
01:34:15,831 --> 01:34:16,790
let's be fucking intense.

3651
01:34:16,791 --> 01:34:17,030
Let's,

3652
01:34:17,030 --> 01:34:18,770
let's sit in Nancy this into the ground.

3653
01:34:19,030 --> 01:34:19,310
Yeah.

3654
01:34:19,310 --> 01:34:24,140
But if you really enjoy life
and you really enjoy the
person fucking why not who

3655
01:34:24,300 --> 01:34:25,133
the shit.

3656
01:34:25,200 --> 01:34:26,090
But I for this one

3657
01:34:26,400 --> 01:34:26,620
color,

3658
01:34:26,620 --> 01:34:28,120
I was like relaxed with the,

3659
01:34:28,330 --> 01:34:29,320
with the moving in thing.

3660
01:34:29,440 --> 01:34:30,200
Right.

3661
01:34:30,200 --> 01:34:30,490
Um,

3662
01:34:30,490 --> 01:34:31,840
and now and now it's even where I'm like,

3663
01:34:32,200 --> 01:34:32,621
so what,

3664
01:34:32,621 --> 01:34:33,520
so what was your plan like?

3665
01:34:33,521 --> 01:34:36,550
You were going to reveal all this
and then you'd be living with me.

3666
01:34:36,580 --> 01:34:36,911
God,

3667
01:34:36,911 --> 01:34:39,910
could you imagine if you were living
with this fucking guy and all that stuff

3668
01:34:39,911 --> 01:34:40,744
came out?

3669
01:34:40,810 --> 01:34:41,320
Uh,

3670
01:34:41,320 --> 01:34:41,921
it would have been,

3671
01:34:41,921 --> 01:34:42,221
I mean,

3672
01:34:42,221 --> 01:34:45,250
I would have had paid
my mortgage from afar.

3673
01:34:45,490 --> 01:34:45,941
Yeah.

3674
01:34:45,941 --> 01:34:46,930
What would you do?

3675
01:34:47,170 --> 01:34:49,330
Jesus Christ physical thing.

3676
01:34:49,660 --> 01:34:51,010
I always kind of like test.

3677
01:34:51,070 --> 01:34:51,851
If I'm dating someone,

3678
01:34:51,851 --> 01:34:52,631
like I'll be like,

3679
01:34:52,631 --> 01:34:53,350
let's,

3680
01:34:53,350 --> 01:34:55,450
I'm going to try to get past
you and see if you can stop me.

3681
01:34:55,670 --> 01:34:56,110
Are you serious?

3682
01:34:56,110 --> 01:34:57,830
I always just try to see physically

3683
01:34:58,010 --> 01:34:58,940
where we are.

3684
01:34:59,600 --> 01:35:02,440
I definitely almost beat a
boyfriend in a restaurant,

3685
01:35:02,441 --> 01:35:03,530
an arm wrestling match one time.

3686
01:35:04,440 --> 01:35:05,150
Yeah.

3687
01:35:05,150 --> 01:35:06,140
Not everybody works out,

3688
01:35:06,170 --> 01:35:07,310
but not everybody's angry.

3689
01:35:07,730 --> 01:35:10,300
But I definitely was in a workout and
I'm angry or you're trying to say,

3690
01:35:10,380 --> 01:35:11,220
and I did not add,

3691
01:35:11,390 --> 01:35:12,223
isn't comparative.

3692
01:35:12,650 --> 01:35:12,801
Uh,

3693
01:35:12,801 --> 01:35:13,760
but the physical thing,

3694
01:35:13,761 --> 01:35:15,920
I definitely pretty works on that.

3695
01:35:15,921 --> 01:35:17,770
Everybody's angry for me.

3696
01:35:17,810 --> 01:35:18,320
I know saying,

3697
01:35:18,320 --> 01:35:20,390
I mean I was saying I'm,

3698
01:35:20,450 --> 01:35:21,470
I work out and I'm angry,

3699
01:35:21,710 --> 01:35:26,510
but I definitely have a male friend that
I have made out with and one time we

3700
01:35:26,511 --> 01:35:28,010
were making out and I,

3701
01:35:28,070 --> 01:35:32,150
he's a giant person and I actually got
scared just being under a body that big.

3702
01:35:32,950 --> 01:35:33,291
And I was like,

3703
01:35:33,291 --> 01:35:34,370
if your arms give out,

3704
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:35,233
like I'm toast.

3705
01:35:35,450 --> 01:35:36,350
Like it's done for me.

3706
01:35:36,380 --> 01:35:36,620
Yeah,

3707
01:35:36,620 --> 01:35:37,431
you won't be able to breathe.

3708
01:35:37,431 --> 01:35:40,190
What if he has an aneurysm when he passed
out on top of you and you suffocate?

3709
01:35:40,220 --> 01:35:41,053
That could happen.

3710
01:35:41,060 --> 01:35:41,990
Cause I sometimes I'll do that.

3711
01:35:41,991 --> 01:35:42,811
I'll be like laying on top of me.

3712
01:35:42,811 --> 01:35:44,150
I want to see if I can get you off of me.

3713
01:35:44,151 --> 01:35:44,871
You know what the key is?

3714
01:35:44,871 --> 01:35:46,130
You got to breathe through your stomach.

3715
01:35:46,190 --> 01:35:47,390
If a guy's on top of you,

3716
01:35:47,391 --> 01:35:49,260
this is what you do and
they pass out on it,

3717
01:35:49,550 --> 01:35:50,510
you can still breathe,

3718
01:35:50,600 --> 01:35:51,800
but you have to breathe
through your stomach.

3719
01:35:51,960 --> 01:35:52,730
The problem is,

3720
01:35:52,730 --> 01:35:53,660
well this is the thing.

3721
01:35:53,661 --> 01:35:54,770
Everybody wants to be like this.

3722
01:35:55,730 --> 01:35:56,690
You want to breathe like that.

3723
01:35:56,840 --> 01:35:58,040
You can agree with diaphragm.

3724
01:35:58,070 --> 01:35:58,271
You can,

3725
01:35:58,271 --> 01:35:58,461
yeah.

3726
01:35:58,461 --> 01:35:59,870
You can breathe from your diaphragm,

3727
01:35:59,871 --> 01:36:03,290
will you literally only move your stomach
because it's doing anything for anyone

3728
01:36:03,291 --> 01:36:04,124
listening,

3729
01:36:04,780 --> 01:36:05,660
listening to Joe Rogan,

3730
01:36:08,660 --> 01:36:09,291
but you can,

3731
01:36:09,291 --> 01:36:11,050
you can breathe with
your stomach where your,

3732
01:36:11,060 --> 01:36:14,690
your chest doesn't expand and contract
and it's very important when someone's

3733
01:36:14,691 --> 01:36:16,460
compressing you and someone's
on top of you and they're,

3734
01:36:16,730 --> 01:36:16,911
they're,

3735
01:36:16,911 --> 01:36:17,750
they're smashing you.

3736
01:36:18,150 --> 01:36:19,790
You have to learn how to stay calm.

3737
01:36:20,130 --> 01:36:20,901
If you're going to date someone,

3738
01:36:20,901 --> 01:36:22,130
learn how to breathe from your diaphragm.

3739
01:36:22,670 --> 01:36:22,971
Well,

3740
01:36:22,971 --> 01:36:24,160
when you're getting choked too,

3741
01:36:24,170 --> 01:36:24,771
it's a big one.

3742
01:36:24,771 --> 01:36:28,100
You have to learn how to relax and
how to conserve your breath and how to

3743
01:36:28,850 --> 01:36:29,683
control your heart rate.

3744
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:30,711
Breathing to my stomach,

3745
01:36:30,711 --> 01:36:32,270
like I feel like I
can't take a big breath.

3746
01:36:32,271 --> 01:36:33,104
You can't.

3747
01:36:33,110 --> 01:36:33,471
You can't.

3748
01:36:33,471 --> 01:36:34,310
That's the whole part of it.

3749
01:36:34,460 --> 01:36:35,160
You're going to have to deal.

3750
01:36:35,160 --> 01:36:35,301
No,

3751
01:36:35,301 --> 01:36:35,661
you won't.

3752
01:36:35,661 --> 01:36:35,871
You'll,

3753
01:36:35,871 --> 01:36:36,710
you'll be okay.

3754
01:36:36,711 --> 01:36:40,100
You just have to know which you have to
do is you have to get comfortable with

3755
01:36:40,101 --> 01:36:41,960
the fact that you're not
going to take a full breath.

3756
01:36:42,320 --> 01:36:43,340
I don't want to get comfortable.

3757
01:36:43,880 --> 01:36:44,030
Well,

3758
01:36:44,030 --> 01:36:46,070
you're going to have to get out
from under this fucking big guy.

3759
01:36:46,071 --> 01:36:48,620
How big we're talking about
300 pounds is a big person.

3760
01:36:48,621 --> 01:36:48,890
Yep.

3761
01:36:48,890 --> 01:36:52,070
300 pounds on top of you
and you're a little bit low.

3762
01:36:52,070 --> 01:36:52,370
Okay.

3763
01:36:52,370 --> 01:36:53,690
To 80 and you're,

3764
01:36:53,691 --> 01:36:54,261
you know what,

3765
01:36:54,261 --> 01:36:56,300
one 10 sure.

3766
01:36:56,690 --> 01:36:57,500
What do you weigh?

3767
01:36:57,500 --> 01:36:57,741
Okay,

3768
01:36:57,741 --> 01:36:58,310
forget it.

3769
01:36:58,310 --> 01:37:03,080
You're a a thin in shape
woman who's about five four,

3770
01:37:03,140 --> 01:37:03,973
right?

3771
01:37:04,700 --> 01:37:05,241
Five five.

3772
01:37:05,241 --> 01:37:05,750
Okay.

3773
01:37:05,750 --> 01:37:07,560
So this big giant gorilla guy,

3774
01:37:07,580 --> 01:37:07,760
right.

3775
01:37:07,760 --> 01:37:09,310
Could conceivably kill me.

3776
01:37:09,440 --> 01:37:09,770
Yeah.

3777
01:37:09,770 --> 01:37:12,830
Anytime he wants you think
about that and you're like,

3778
01:37:12,831 --> 01:37:12,891
oh,

3779
01:37:12,891 --> 01:37:13,311
this person.

3780
01:37:13,311 --> 01:37:14,750
So you really just never know.

3781
01:37:14,751 --> 01:37:15,980
Everyone's a ticking time bomb.

3782
01:37:16,250 --> 01:37:16,581
And I was like,

3783
01:37:16,581 --> 01:37:17,990
if you choose to snap right now,

3784
01:37:18,050 --> 01:37:18,231
well,

3785
01:37:18,231 --> 01:37:20,150
I also have friends that are,

3786
01:37:20,360 --> 01:37:22,190
there's a friend a,

3787
01:37:22,430 --> 01:37:24,200
and then there's friend a when he's drunk,

3788
01:37:24,201 --> 01:37:25,280
which I don't even know that guy.

3789
01:37:25,310 --> 01:37:25,790
Sure.

3790
01:37:25,790 --> 01:37:26,120
There's,

3791
01:37:26,120 --> 01:37:28,970
there's people that get drunk and their
eyes glaze over and they're like a

3792
01:37:28,971 --> 01:37:29,870
totally different person.

3793
01:37:29,871 --> 01:37:32,870
They say shit to people that you would
never see them say when they're sober.

3794
01:37:33,080 --> 01:37:33,980
They get aggressive,

3795
01:37:33,981 --> 01:37:34,641
they get Douchey,

3796
01:37:34,641 --> 01:37:36,710
they start fights and
utilize that make you mad.

3797
01:37:36,710 --> 01:37:37,543
You're like us.

3798
01:37:38,240 --> 01:37:39,620
You don't get the luxury of alcohol.

3799
01:37:39,800 --> 01:37:43,040
You can't control yourself and act like
a person so you shouldn't be able to

3800
01:37:43,041 --> 01:37:43,430
drink.

3801
01:37:43,430 --> 01:37:47,420
Well it's alcoholism is what it is and
I've never understood alcoholism when I,

3802
01:37:47,710 --> 01:37:50,660
I'm sort of ignorant in
that way that I always,

3803
01:37:51,430 --> 01:37:52,263
um,

3804
01:37:52,370 --> 01:37:53,510
what's the best way to say this?

3805
01:37:54,080 --> 01:37:54,560
Uh,

3806
01:37:54,560 --> 01:37:55,920
my own shortcomings.

3807
01:37:56,040 --> 01:37:59,610
I F I thought that it was a weakness
that people had and it was just simply a

3808
01:37:59,611 --> 01:38:00,660
matter of character.

3809
01:38:00,840 --> 01:38:04,980
And I didn't believe in a
alcoholism as a disease,

3810
01:38:05,130 --> 01:38:08,730
but I have personally seen
people wear their personality.

3811
01:38:08,820 --> 01:38:12,690
So radically change is under
the influence of alcohol that I,

3812
01:38:12,691 --> 01:38:14,490
there's no other way to
attribute it to that.

3813
01:38:14,491 --> 01:38:16,470
Like almost like an allergic reaction.

3814
01:38:16,770 --> 01:38:18,480
Like they become a different person.

3815
01:38:18,481 --> 01:38:19,250
It's like they're,

3816
01:38:19,250 --> 01:38:22,110
their body is just not good with alcohol.

3817
01:38:22,250 --> 01:38:23,083
That alcohol,

3818
01:38:23,190 --> 01:38:23,730
and this is,

3819
01:38:23,730 --> 01:38:24,541
I'm actually asking,

3820
01:38:24,541 --> 01:38:28,290
it's not positing this just
for funsies is it alcoholism?

3821
01:38:28,290 --> 01:38:31,590
If you know you're not drinking all the
time and it's just when you have a drink

3822
01:38:31,591 --> 01:38:32,311
you at crazy.

3823
01:38:32,311 --> 01:38:33,420
Is that still alcoholism?

3824
01:38:33,570 --> 01:38:34,410
I think it is.

3825
01:38:34,411 --> 01:38:35,071
I think it is.

3826
01:38:35,071 --> 01:38:36,120
I think some people,

3827
01:38:36,480 --> 01:38:37,470
for whatever reason,

3828
01:38:37,471 --> 01:38:39,000
whether it's genetic and there are,

3829
01:38:39,120 --> 01:38:43,140
I think there's definitely a genetic
mechanism to alcoholism as well.

3830
01:38:43,141 --> 01:38:44,490
And I don't know what it is.

3831
01:38:44,520 --> 01:38:44,900
I don't,

3832
01:38:44,900 --> 01:38:45,000
I'm,

3833
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:45,160
I'm,

3834
01:38:45,160 --> 01:38:45,361
I'm,

3835
01:38:45,361 --> 01:38:48,630
I'm not totally educated on it,

3836
01:38:48,930 --> 01:38:52,020
but there's some people were
alcoholism runs in the family.

3837
01:38:53,070 --> 01:38:53,451
I don't,

3838
01:38:53,451 --> 01:38:54,211
I'm like you,

3839
01:38:54,211 --> 01:38:55,560
I didn't grow up with any alcoholics.

3840
01:38:55,561 --> 01:38:58,890
I grew up in like a suburb where I think
when you grow up somewhere like La,

3841
01:38:59,190 --> 01:39:00,360
la in particular it,

3842
01:39:00,600 --> 01:39:02,070
I was talking about this
last night at dinner,

3843
01:39:02,370 --> 01:39:03,840
it sort of breathe,

3844
01:39:03,841 --> 01:39:04,260
it's this,

3845
01:39:04,260 --> 01:39:04,501
uh,

3846
01:39:04,501 --> 01:39:08,400
environment where everyone is recovery
and it's part of the conversation in

3847
01:39:08,401 --> 01:39:09,234
general.

3848
01:39:09,240 --> 01:39:11,760
So you grow up very sensitive to
those things and what alcohol is,

3849
01:39:11,761 --> 01:39:14,280
can do and what addicts
behavior and mentality is.

3850
01:39:14,520 --> 01:39:15,450
I didn't grow up with any of that.

3851
01:39:15,600 --> 01:39:15,840
Right.

3852
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:19,290
And I don't choose to be educated on it
because I don't have to be part of that

3853
01:39:19,291 --> 01:39:20,124
world.

3854
01:39:20,130 --> 01:39:21,450
I'm not putting them down or anything,

3855
01:39:21,451 --> 01:39:24,150
but I'm not going to date
anyone with an addict mentality.

3856
01:39:24,450 --> 01:39:25,650
I'm not surrounded by anyone with that.

3857
01:39:25,680 --> 01:39:26,513
It's not a,

3858
01:39:26,520 --> 01:39:27,990
it's not an education that I need.

3859
01:39:28,200 --> 01:39:31,890
Would you avoid someone who had been to
rehab and would you avoid someone who

3860
01:39:31,891 --> 01:39:34,350
used to have an alcohol or a drug problem?

3861
01:39:34,620 --> 01:39:35,453
I like drinking.

3862
01:39:35,880 --> 01:39:39,140
Like I like to go out and have fun and
I don't want to offend even there's

3863
01:39:39,150 --> 01:39:40,710
certain people that can
drink and they're like,

3864
01:39:40,711 --> 01:39:41,750
I don't care if you drink that,

3865
01:39:41,751 --> 01:39:44,520
that can't drink and they don't care if
you drink around them because it's such

3866
01:39:44,521 --> 01:39:45,900
a big social aspect.

3867
01:39:46,380 --> 01:39:47,460
It would depend on the person.

3868
01:39:48,120 --> 01:39:48,440
Um,

3869
01:39:48,440 --> 01:39:49,610
and it would also depend on what the eye,

3870
01:39:49,710 --> 01:39:50,760
it's not about judging them,

3871
01:39:50,761 --> 01:39:54,720
but it's are you the kind of person who
has these triggers and it's going to be

3872
01:39:54,721 --> 01:39:57,810
an issue for the rest of your life or
are you dealing with it but able to

3873
01:39:57,811 --> 01:39:58,644
function?

3874
01:39:58,800 --> 01:40:00,360
It really would just depend on the person.

3875
01:40:00,540 --> 01:40:01,020
Right.

3876
01:40:01,020 --> 01:40:01,440
Yeah.

3877
01:40:01,440 --> 01:40:04,170
I mean I have no problem with someone
who gets her shit together and realizes

3878
01:40:04,210 --> 01:40:05,820
they had a problem and then pulls it out.

3879
01:40:06,060 --> 01:40:06,511
And again,

3880
01:40:06,511 --> 01:40:10,470
I think there really is some sort of
a genetic component to alcoholism.

3881
01:40:10,650 --> 01:40:11,483
Well there is,

3882
01:40:12,540 --> 01:40:13,373
but I don't,

3883
01:40:13,440 --> 01:40:15,710
I think I get irritated because
when you're younger like,

3884
01:40:15,720 --> 01:40:17,400
and when you're in your twenties
and we all have those friends,

3885
01:40:17,401 --> 01:40:20,070
like we would have friends that would
just do weird shit when they would get

3886
01:40:20,071 --> 01:40:20,820
drunk.

3887
01:40:20,820 --> 01:40:22,890
I'm very much the same person.

3888
01:40:22,920 --> 01:40:23,660
I'm very,

3889
01:40:23,660 --> 01:40:23,940
I'm,

3890
01:40:23,940 --> 01:40:24,720
when I'm drunk,

3891
01:40:24,720 --> 01:40:26,100
I'm just like a little bit looser,

3892
01:40:26,101 --> 01:40:27,840
but I'm not saying weird things.

3893
01:40:27,841 --> 01:40:28,890
I'm not starting fights.

3894
01:40:28,920 --> 01:40:30,300
I remember everything.

3895
01:40:30,780 --> 01:40:31,200
Um,

3896
01:40:31,200 --> 01:40:34,470
and when people can't act like
humans when they get drunk,

3897
01:40:34,471 --> 01:40:35,940
I just choose to remove myself from that.

3898
01:40:36,120 --> 01:40:36,400
Yeah.

3899
01:40:36,400 --> 01:40:38,910
The aggressive drunks are
the weirdest ones to me.

3900
01:40:38,911 --> 01:40:40,080
Like I'm the opposite.

3901
01:40:40,110 --> 01:40:40,741
When I'm drunk,

3902
01:40:40,741 --> 01:40:41,820
I'm everyone's friend over.

3903
01:40:41,840 --> 01:40:44,100
The last thing I want to do is
get in a fight when I'm drunk.

3904
01:40:44,250 --> 01:40:45,240
I just never gonna work out.

3905
01:40:45,241 --> 01:40:46,080
You're never going to wake and be like,

3906
01:40:46,110 --> 01:40:46,561
oh wow.

3907
01:40:46,561 --> 01:40:48,150
I really rocked all those people.

3908
01:40:48,151 --> 01:40:51,570
And one I came out
unscathed and drove home.

3909
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:52,111
Well,

3910
01:40:52,111 --> 01:40:53,040
there are people that can,

3911
01:40:53,230 --> 01:40:53,771
when they're drunk,

3912
01:40:53,771 --> 01:40:53,980
don't

3913
01:40:53,980 --> 01:40:54,760
get confused.

3914
01:40:54,760 --> 01:40:54,991
If you,

3915
01:40:54,991 --> 01:40:55,551
you're thinking that,

3916
01:40:55,551 --> 01:40:55,660
oh,

3917
01:40:55,660 --> 01:40:56,351
this guy's drunk,

3918
01:40:56,351 --> 01:40:58,450
I can kick his ass now guys.

3919
01:40:58,451 --> 01:40:59,800
Especially the retard strength.

3920
01:40:59,820 --> 01:41:00,070
Yeah.

3921
01:41:00,070 --> 01:41:00,371
Well,

3922
01:41:00,371 --> 01:41:03,100
there's just some people that know how
to fight and when they're drunk doesn't

3923
01:41:03,101 --> 01:41:04,150
really diminish that much.

3924
01:41:04,390 --> 01:41:04,790
Okay.

3925
01:41:04,790 --> 01:41:05,623
And they like it.

3926
01:41:05,860 --> 01:41:06,910
But I think for the most part,

3927
01:41:06,911 --> 01:41:08,170
people that get drunk and want to fight,

3928
01:41:08,200 --> 01:41:10,720
they're not skilled for
every guy like that.

3929
01:41:10,721 --> 01:41:12,340
There's a guy like tank Abbott out there,

3930
01:41:12,370 --> 01:41:16,090
there's a rare duty could drink a fucking
gallon of vodka and beat the shit out

3931
01:41:16,091 --> 01:41:17,560
of a whole room full of bad asses.

3932
01:41:17,590 --> 01:41:17,860
Right.

3933
01:41:17,860 --> 01:41:19,130
There's guys like that out there.

3934
01:41:19,410 --> 01:41:20,490
Probably date him next.

3935
01:41:22,100 --> 01:41:24,210
And Abbott please.

3936
01:41:24,520 --> 01:41:27,270
He's got a big giant beer belly
and he's well UFC veteran.

3937
01:41:27,530 --> 01:41:27,661
Oh,

3938
01:41:27,661 --> 01:41:28,494
that sounds awful.

3939
01:41:28,610 --> 01:41:28,860
Uh,

3940
01:41:28,860 --> 01:41:29,520
he's awesome.

3941
01:41:29,520 --> 01:41:30,690
Tank Abbott sounds awesome.

3942
01:41:30,750 --> 01:41:31,550
He's awesome.

3943
01:41:31,550 --> 01:41:31,680
Yeah,

3944
01:41:31,680 --> 01:41:32,371
that's tank cabinet.

3945
01:41:32,371 --> 01:41:33,204
There he is.

3946
01:41:33,510 --> 01:41:34,740
Oh my God.

3947
01:41:34,830 --> 01:41:35,381
He's a bug.

3948
01:41:35,381 --> 01:41:35,821
An animal.

3949
01:41:35,821 --> 01:41:37,090
That Guy Gordon's fisherman,

3950
01:41:37,091 --> 01:41:37,740
but bloated.

3951
01:41:37,740 --> 01:41:38,280
He,

3952
01:41:38,280 --> 01:41:42,870
what I love about that guy is like he
would fight anybody and you could call him

3953
01:41:42,871 --> 01:41:44,910
up a day before he'd be on a bar stool.

3954
01:41:44,940 --> 01:41:46,170
You can call him up and go tank.

3955
01:41:46,500 --> 01:41:47,510
Do you want to fight this weekend?

3956
01:41:47,550 --> 01:41:47,911
You'd be like,

3957
01:41:47,911 --> 01:41:48,744
fuck yeah,

3958
01:41:48,750 --> 01:41:50,660
tell me where to be would show off.

3959
01:41:51,270 --> 01:41:52,500
And he might not be in shape,

3960
01:41:52,530 --> 01:41:52,800
you know,

3961
01:41:52,800 --> 01:41:54,240
because he wasn't training
because he was drinking.

3962
01:41:54,241 --> 01:41:56,460
But he would try to fucking win
with every ounce of his being.

3963
01:41:56,461 --> 01:41:57,630
And if you went out on his shield,

3964
01:41:57,960 --> 01:42:00,960
he went out on his shield and you catch
him that night at the bar and you better

3965
01:42:00,961 --> 01:42:03,000
not start talking shit
to him about how he lost,

3966
01:42:03,001 --> 01:42:04,500
cause he'll fucking knock your teeth down.

3967
01:42:04,501 --> 01:42:05,380
Your throat on.

3968
01:42:05,381 --> 01:42:05,911
People are just,

3969
01:42:05,911 --> 01:42:08,460
cause motherfuckers enjoys it.

3970
01:42:08,570 --> 01:42:10,890
He legitimately enjoyed fighting.

3971
01:42:11,160 --> 01:42:14,070
It takes every type of people to
make this crazy world go around.

3972
01:42:14,310 --> 01:42:15,420
There's people like that too.

3973
01:42:15,470 --> 01:42:17,070
What about can I hit in the face?

3974
01:42:17,100 --> 01:42:18,520
That's what I always want to know about.

3975
01:42:18,600 --> 01:42:19,530
Like I would ask Rhonda,

3976
01:42:19,531 --> 01:42:20,310
it'd be like,

3977
01:42:20,310 --> 01:42:22,050
aren't you afraid of
getting hit in the face?

3978
01:42:22,670 --> 01:42:25,280
Well you can't be afraid of getting hit
in the face if that's what you do for a

3979
01:42:25,281 --> 01:42:25,551
living.

3980
01:42:25,551 --> 01:42:28,220
But getting hit in the face is not fun.

3981
01:42:28,240 --> 01:42:28,430
No,

3982
01:42:28,430 --> 01:42:29,540
it's not good for you either.

3983
01:42:29,940 --> 01:42:30,773
And I'm like,

3984
01:42:30,930 --> 01:42:31,350
yeah,

3985
01:42:31,350 --> 01:42:31,861
I did that.

3986
01:42:31,861 --> 01:42:32,671
To me it would,

3987
01:42:32,671 --> 01:42:33,504
it's not so much.

3988
01:42:33,870 --> 01:42:34,111
No,

3989
01:42:34,111 --> 01:42:34,291
I don't.

3990
01:42:34,291 --> 01:42:34,861
I'm not a fight.

3991
01:42:34,861 --> 01:42:36,210
I'm not a physical fighter.

3992
01:42:36,270 --> 01:42:37,081
I might be a tough girl.

3993
01:42:37,081 --> 01:42:39,900
But like the idea of like either hitting
someone in the face or getting hit in

3994
01:42:39,901 --> 01:42:40,734
the face,

3995
01:42:40,770 --> 01:42:41,700
I don't want to lose a tooth.

3996
01:42:42,040 --> 01:42:42,191
Well,

3997
01:42:42,191 --> 01:42:42,791
you're smart.

3998
01:42:42,791 --> 01:42:46,570
That's why some people don't have any
idea what it's like to get hit in the

3999
01:42:46,571 --> 01:42:46,901
face.

4000
01:42:46,901 --> 01:42:47,711
And so they like,

4001
01:42:47,711 --> 01:42:49,480
think of it like very nonchalantly.

4002
01:42:49,610 --> 01:42:49,821
Well,

4003
01:42:49,821 --> 01:42:52,220
it's weird that you say that because
I've had this conversation with,

4004
01:42:52,250 --> 01:42:54,110
it's mostly my Italian male friends,

4005
01:42:54,340 --> 01:42:55,760
but he ain't trying to say,

4006
01:42:56,030 --> 01:42:57,200
I don't know what road headquarters.

4007
01:42:57,230 --> 01:42:58,280
Italian one quarter Irish.

4008
01:42:58,340 --> 01:42:58,581
Okay,

4009
01:42:58,581 --> 01:43:00,020
well that explains a lot.

4010
01:43:00,980 --> 01:43:01,813
Just kidding.

4011
01:43:01,900 --> 01:43:02,420
Um,

4012
01:43:02,420 --> 01:43:03,740
but there is that thing,

4013
01:43:03,741 --> 01:43:05,210
that mentality where,

4014
01:43:05,211 --> 01:43:06,920
and I think because I
hang out with enough men,

4015
01:43:07,130 --> 01:43:08,660
I'm able to identify this.

4016
01:43:09,560 --> 01:43:10,161
There's certain,

4017
01:43:10,161 --> 01:43:12,830
there's like a certain attitude by guys
who have never been hit in the face

4018
01:43:12,831 --> 01:43:13,664
before.

4019
01:43:13,910 --> 01:43:14,840
And it's not always,

4020
01:43:15,380 --> 01:43:18,260
but there's a certain cockiness
where like no one knows what fear is.

4021
01:43:18,261 --> 01:43:19,610
No one's ever instilled fear on them.

4022
01:43:19,730 --> 01:43:20,000
Right?

4023
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:20,900
So they're assholes and you're like,

4024
01:43:20,920 --> 01:43:24,140
what do you need to do is go out and
have someone beat the fuck out of you so

4025
01:43:24,141 --> 01:43:27,320
you can show a little bit of humility
and not be such a dick all the time.

4026
01:43:27,620 --> 01:43:29,150
Some people need to get beaten up.

4027
01:43:29,180 --> 01:43:30,110
It's not for girls,

4028
01:43:30,200 --> 01:43:30,471
girls,

4029
01:43:30,471 --> 01:43:31,011
I need to get beaten up.

4030
01:43:31,011 --> 01:43:34,910
But some guys like just in the way that
they address other men are the way that

4031
01:43:34,911 --> 01:43:35,421
they act.

4032
01:43:35,421 --> 01:43:35,781
And you're like,

4033
01:43:35,781 --> 01:43:36,614
you've never,

4034
01:43:36,770 --> 01:43:39,410
you've never been humiliated
or taken down a peg ever.

4035
01:43:39,710 --> 01:43:40,550
You're totally right.

4036
01:43:40,790 --> 01:43:41,500
That's the word.

4037
01:43:41,500 --> 01:43:44,290
Well that's what I think martial arts
are very important for men growing up.

4038
01:43:44,291 --> 01:43:47,620
Not because they need to get beat up
just because they need to control their

4039
01:43:47,621 --> 01:43:47,981
ego.

4040
01:43:47,981 --> 01:43:51,470
And one of the best ways to control your
ego is to put yourself into incredibly

4041
01:43:51,500 --> 01:43:52,010
difficult

4042
01:43:52,010 --> 01:43:52,843
situations,

4043
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:54,170
tests your character,

4044
01:43:54,380 --> 01:43:57,950
and then you have confidence so you don't
behave in that way in the first place.

4045
01:43:58,010 --> 01:44:01,010
I think a lot of the way guys behave
that sort of delusional behavior.

4046
01:44:01,430 --> 01:44:03,140
It's almost a convinced themselves.

4047
01:44:03,141 --> 01:44:07,400
It's like this weird chest pub puffy
thing and it comes out a lot of times when

4048
01:44:07,401 --> 01:44:09,980
they're drunk because they
don't have confidence.

4049
01:44:10,100 --> 01:44:14,570
They don't have the real confidence
that someone who's been tested and

4050
01:44:14,571 --> 01:44:17,060
understands their character
and knows their limitations.

4051
01:44:17,061 --> 01:44:17,894
You know,

4052
01:44:18,080 --> 01:44:21,040
I think there's two schools of thought
because what you just said was you were

4053
01:44:21,170 --> 01:44:23,180
saying how they have
to convince themselves.

4054
01:44:23,330 --> 01:44:23,961
So there's almost,

4055
01:44:23,961 --> 01:44:25,250
there's like the way of the warrior,

4056
01:44:25,251 --> 01:44:26,031
which is the one you're talking about.

4057
01:44:26,031 --> 01:44:28,160
And then there's like the used
car salesman where it's like,

4058
01:44:28,550 --> 01:44:28,700
Eh,

4059
01:44:28,700 --> 01:44:32,370
like ABC baby and I'm taking seminars
and if I don't believe at first,

4060
01:44:32,371 --> 01:44:33,230
then who else will,

4061
01:44:33,231 --> 01:44:38,000
and it's almost like that like sort of
unconscious delusional mentality where

4062
01:44:38,001 --> 01:44:39,650
like light it might like,

4063
01:44:39,651 --> 01:44:40,800
it's almost like if you lie to yourself,

4064
01:44:40,801 --> 01:44:42,260
then you can lie to others that works.

4065
01:44:42,261 --> 01:44:43,300
If you're on a plane,

4066
01:44:43,310 --> 01:44:46,730
you're trying to pick up a check and then
get into a relationship with her for a

4067
01:44:46,730 --> 01:44:48,750
year as a friend and then three
months while you're fucking her.

4068
01:44:48,751 --> 01:44:50,210
I mean just that can work.

4069
01:44:50,211 --> 01:44:51,044
Go bulldogs.

4070
01:44:53,030 --> 01:44:54,800
He just got to know how to sling it.

4071
01:44:55,070 --> 01:44:55,400
You know,

4072
01:44:55,400 --> 01:44:56,233
bullshit.

4073
01:44:56,250 --> 01:44:57,830
It does work on occasionally,

4074
01:44:57,831 --> 01:44:58,664
even with smart,

4075
01:44:58,700 --> 01:45:01,070
I mean that's what's the most impressive
thing about his accomplishment.

4076
01:45:01,071 --> 01:45:01,904
You are,

4077
01:45:01,940 --> 01:45:02,773
you know,

4078
01:45:03,050 --> 01:45:04,280
you're one of my smartest friends.

4079
01:45:04,281 --> 01:45:04,910
You're smart,

4080
01:45:04,910 --> 01:45:05,631
you're very smart.

4081
01:45:05,631 --> 01:45:06,464
You're very quick.

4082
01:45:06,560 --> 01:45:10,070
And for a guy to trick you like that and
a trick you over a long period of time

4083
01:45:10,071 --> 01:45:10,904
with a lot of,

4084
01:45:10,970 --> 01:45:11,271
you know,

4085
01:45:11,271 --> 01:45:14,540
a lot of questions along the way
where you hit some bumps I guess.

4086
01:45:14,541 --> 01:45:15,291
But here's the other thing.

4087
01:45:15,291 --> 01:45:17,490
I mean I don't even know if
the word is trick and I'll,

4088
01:45:17,540 --> 01:45:18,600
I mean I totally fell for it.

4089
01:45:18,910 --> 01:45:19,743
The shit out of you.

4090
01:45:19,850 --> 01:45:21,470
I feel like,

4091
01:45:21,800 --> 01:45:23,030
I guess it is tricky,

4092
01:45:23,060 --> 01:45:24,650
but it's also one that he's like,

4093
01:45:24,651 --> 01:45:26,270
why would I question that in my life?

4094
01:45:26,271 --> 01:45:28,550
No one's ever lied about where
they went to school that I knew of.

4095
01:45:29,180 --> 01:45:32,210
These are not lies that in society
we're told to look out for.

4096
01:45:32,211 --> 01:45:33,350
It'd be one like everyone's like,

4097
01:45:33,351 --> 01:45:34,250
does he have another family?

4098
01:45:34,280 --> 01:45:36,770
I don't even think about like your school.

4099
01:45:36,771 --> 01:45:37,401
Like who cares?

4100
01:45:37,401 --> 01:45:39,680
It's like lying about your blood
type and let's not just his,

4101
01:45:39,710 --> 01:45:41,690
he lied about where most likely,

4102
01:45:41,691 --> 01:45:42,380
let's be honest,

4103
01:45:42,380 --> 01:45:45,890
most likely lied about his mom having
cancer because you were dating a big heart

4104
01:45:45,891 --> 01:45:46,520
guy,

4105
01:45:46,520 --> 01:45:47,001
you know,

4106
01:45:47,001 --> 01:45:48,680
and he most likely lied.

4107
01:45:48,710 --> 01:45:48,861
Well,

4108
01:45:48,861 --> 01:45:52,220
he definitely lied about the
skeleton bones part about England.

4109
01:45:52,750 --> 01:45:54,470
He lied about his house twice.

4110
01:45:54,471 --> 01:45:55,071
He lied about,

4111
01:45:55,071 --> 01:45:55,450
you know,

4112
01:45:55,450 --> 01:45:58,360
he sounds like a guy who just lies at a d.

4113
01:45:58,410 --> 01:46:02,120
It means probably gotten laid
doing that his whole life.

4114
01:46:02,210 --> 01:46:03,380
I don't think he's gotten late enough.

4115
01:46:03,381 --> 01:46:04,370
I think that's what it was.

4116
01:46:05,740 --> 01:46:06,860
I'm just thinking about it.

4117
01:46:07,480 --> 01:46:07,670
No,

4118
01:46:07,670 --> 01:46:08,600
because I don't think it's,

4119
01:46:08,660 --> 01:46:11,750
he's not like I totally got tricked.

4120
01:46:12,020 --> 01:46:13,190
I'm not above admitting that.

4121
01:46:13,490 --> 01:46:15,170
I'm also not above admitting that.

4122
01:46:15,171 --> 01:46:16,580
I think when you love someone,

4123
01:46:16,790 --> 01:46:18,740
you're judgment is clouded and I didn't,

4124
01:46:19,160 --> 01:46:21,170
I didn't know the scope
of what that could be.

4125
01:46:21,171 --> 01:46:23,680
I didn't in a billion years I wouldn't
have thought that that was really,

4126
01:46:23,720 --> 01:46:24,890
I thought it was a joke that like,

4127
01:46:24,920 --> 01:46:25,131
oh,

4128
01:46:25,131 --> 01:46:26,270
we can't find his yell diploma,

4129
01:46:26,271 --> 01:46:27,070
whatever,

4130
01:46:27,070 --> 01:46:28,880
but you almost don't want it to be true.

4131
01:46:29,300 --> 01:46:32,090
There's the thing that's going
to happen in our lifetimes,

4132
01:46:32,091 --> 01:46:35,630
I believe were lying is going
to be a thing of the past.

4133
01:46:35,690 --> 01:46:37,670
I really do believe that we can't anymore.

4134
01:46:37,860 --> 01:46:42,020
I think technology is moving us along
that trail where there's gonna come a

4135
01:46:42,021 --> 01:46:45,290
point in time where we're going to
have a connection with each other.

4136
01:46:45,440 --> 01:46:47,540
That's not as simple as just talking.

4137
01:46:47,870 --> 01:46:49,650
I think they're on the way.

4138
01:46:49,651 --> 01:46:51,900
Did you see that new Google
thing that they came up with?

4139
01:46:52,110 --> 01:46:57,110
Their Google is working on a contact
lens right now that monitors your glucose

4140
01:46:57,181 --> 01:47:02,010
levels for diabetics and does all kinds
of weird shit like the same along the

4141
01:47:02,011 --> 01:47:03,510
same lines of Google glass,

4142
01:47:03,511 --> 01:47:05,890
but far more complex and,

4143
01:47:05,891 --> 01:47:06,131
and,

4144
01:47:06,131 --> 01:47:10,920
and analyzes your body when we're dealing
with these kind of technological human

4145
01:47:10,921 --> 01:47:14,100
interfaces is symbiotic relationship
with people and electronics.

4146
01:47:14,520 --> 01:47:15,000
We're event,

4147
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:18,300
it's eventually gonna make its way to
communication and then I think that just

4148
01:47:18,330 --> 01:47:18,500
the,

4149
01:47:18,500 --> 01:47:21,360
the lines of communication and it's
one of the things that they've been

4150
01:47:21,361 --> 01:47:25,740
speculating on that we're going to
be able to read each other's minds.

4151
01:47:25,741 --> 01:47:26,360
Essentially.

4152
01:47:26,360 --> 01:47:29,460
We're going to be able to exchange
thought through Wifi there.

4153
01:47:29,510 --> 01:47:30,120
There's,

4154
01:47:30,120 --> 01:47:33,210
I think I saw something recently
about that like telekinesis,

4155
01:47:33,211 --> 01:47:36,600
but like mind control and be
able to move things just because,

4156
01:47:36,870 --> 01:47:39,210
but if that contact lens can
manage your glucose levels,

4157
01:47:39,330 --> 01:47:40,800
that means it can monitor other levels,

4158
01:47:40,930 --> 01:47:42,480
which means it could
be a lie detector test.

4159
01:47:42,480 --> 01:47:42,811
Yes.

4160
01:47:42,811 --> 01:47:44,700
That's a walking truth
serum in your motherfucking,

4161
01:47:44,810 --> 01:47:45,140
Huh?

4162
01:47:45,140 --> 01:47:45,530
Yup,

4163
01:47:45,530 --> 01:47:45,790
Yup.

4164
01:47:45,790 --> 01:47:46,140
Yeah,

4165
01:47:46,140 --> 01:47:48,750
and you're going to be able to see
whether or not someone has it on or off.

4166
01:47:48,780 --> 01:47:49,201
Oh my God.

4167
01:47:49,201 --> 01:47:50,520
You have your lie detector blocked,

4168
01:47:50,730 --> 01:47:53,730
like you'll be able to see like blocks
almost like Facebook set to private.

4169
01:47:53,760 --> 01:47:54,450
Yes.

4170
01:47:54,450 --> 01:47:54,721
Yeah.

4171
01:47:54,721 --> 01:47:55,890
If they have is her Twitter back,

4172
01:47:55,920 --> 01:47:58,410
they have a big lock on
their Twitter Twitter page.

4173
01:47:58,450 --> 01:47:59,490
That's also shit by the way,

4174
01:47:59,520 --> 01:48:00,211
like that's my other thing.

4175
01:48:00,211 --> 01:48:00,900
When people rights,

4176
01:48:00,900 --> 01:48:02,010
I tweet about this the other day.

4177
01:48:02,240 --> 01:48:03,570
People write something Shitty to you,

4178
01:48:03,660 --> 01:48:05,790
but then they have like a
locked or private profile.

4179
01:48:06,300 --> 01:48:09,120
You don't get to erase that person mean
like you don't get to have an opinion.

4180
01:48:09,210 --> 01:48:09,361
Oh,

4181
01:48:09,361 --> 01:48:10,320
I blocked them anyway.

4182
01:48:10,350 --> 01:48:12,840
I blocked everyone who says
anything even remotely Shitty,

4183
01:48:13,050 --> 01:48:14,400
if that's how you're trying to respond,

4184
01:48:14,401 --> 01:48:15,240
get me to respond.

4185
01:48:15,240 --> 01:48:17,850
Or are you just trolling or whatever
you're trying to do is one thing.

4186
01:48:17,851 --> 01:48:18,000
They've,

4187
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:19,260
you have a legitimate criticism.

4188
01:48:19,290 --> 01:48:22,620
I appreciate legitimate
criticisms cause you know,

4189
01:48:23,100 --> 01:48:23,820
you,

4190
01:48:23,820 --> 01:48:26,040
even if I don't agree
with their assessment,

4191
01:48:26,041 --> 01:48:27,750
I think that objectively it's,

4192
01:48:27,780 --> 01:48:28,230
it's,

4193
01:48:28,230 --> 01:48:30,480
it's a very valuable asset,

4194
01:48:30,600 --> 01:48:34,500
especially if they're intelligent to hear
and intelligent person's take on you,

4195
01:48:34,530 --> 01:48:36,450
even if it's negative and
intelligent fan who wants to,

4196
01:48:36,451 --> 01:48:37,380
they just want to interact.

4197
01:48:37,381 --> 01:48:37,920
Yes.

4198
01:48:37,920 --> 01:48:38,820
There's nothing wrong with that.

4199
01:48:38,821 --> 01:48:40,740
I actually once in a
while depend on people.

4200
01:48:40,741 --> 01:48:41,220
I,

4201
01:48:41,220 --> 01:48:42,630
I'm a huge grammar stickler.

4202
01:48:42,810 --> 01:48:44,580
So when people write back
and I'll make a mistake,

4203
01:48:44,581 --> 01:48:45,990
I'll write the wrong thing
and they'll correct it.

4204
01:48:46,380 --> 01:48:48,150
I'll go back and I'll erase
that tweet and repost it.

4205
01:48:48,180 --> 01:48:48,640
Me Too.

4206
01:48:48,640 --> 01:48:48,750
Yeah.

4207
01:48:48,750 --> 01:48:50,520
It doesn't bother me one
bit and I'll say thanks.

4208
01:48:51,090 --> 01:48:51,841
Thanks for the heads up.

4209
01:48:51,841 --> 01:48:52,270
Like I,

4210
01:48:52,270 --> 01:48:55,170
a lot of times on my phone to my
eyes are starting to go to shit too.

4211
01:48:55,170 --> 01:48:56,810
I'm 46 now and um,

4212
01:48:56,920 --> 01:48:57,120
I,

4213
01:48:57,120 --> 01:49:00,360
I'll wear reading glasses if I'm reading
a book now over the last like year,

4214
01:49:00,361 --> 01:49:01,230
this is the new thing.

4215
01:49:01,410 --> 01:49:03,300
But if I'm looking at Twitter,

4216
01:49:03,301 --> 01:49:03,900
if uh,

4217
01:49:03,900 --> 01:49:05,640
like I'm on a plane or
something like that,

4218
01:49:05,641 --> 01:49:07,110
if I'm looking at it on my phone,

4219
01:49:07,320 --> 01:49:08,153
it started like,

4220
01:49:08,190 --> 01:49:10,410
I can read this like loud and clear.

4221
01:49:10,440 --> 01:49:11,460
No problem whatsoever.

4222
01:49:11,580 --> 01:49:15,510
But weird little small things
are starting to get blurry.

4223
01:49:15,690 --> 01:49:17,610
They're starting to get
blurry in some weird way.

4224
01:49:17,611 --> 01:49:19,010
So I'll occasionally fuck up a word,

4225
01:49:19,020 --> 01:49:20,610
not realize it until I post it.

4226
01:49:20,790 --> 01:49:21,440
And I'm like,

4227
01:49:21,440 --> 01:49:22,890
God dammit the worst.

4228
01:49:22,891 --> 01:49:26,040
Especially when you'd like or on Instagram
is the worst because you can edit it.

4229
01:49:26,100 --> 01:49:26,701
We deleted,

4230
01:49:26,701 --> 01:49:27,750
I did it the other day.

4231
01:49:27,751 --> 01:49:28,920
I wrote silly butch,

4232
01:49:29,070 --> 01:49:30,240
but I meant silly bitch.

4233
01:49:30,480 --> 01:49:33,330
But my phone corrected it to silly butch.

4234
01:49:33,420 --> 01:49:34,050
Ah,

4235
01:49:34,050 --> 01:49:34,650
autocorrect,

4236
01:49:34,650 --> 01:49:37,020
why can't we turn that
off shit and shot too.

4237
01:49:37,110 --> 01:49:38,760
She said Shit a thousand times.

4238
01:49:38,850 --> 01:49:39,990
Why You keep riding shot?

4239
01:49:39,991 --> 01:49:40,501
You know what I mean?

4240
01:49:40,501 --> 01:49:40,801
Shit,

4241
01:49:40,801 --> 01:49:43,710
you fuck mine won't let
me write the word food.

4242
01:49:43,950 --> 01:49:45,540
It always changes it too good.

4243
01:49:45,541 --> 01:49:45,871
And I'm like,

4244
01:49:45,871 --> 01:49:49,840
these are both legitimate words that
are used often and it's just got this

4245
01:49:49,841 --> 01:49:50,674
thing.

4246
01:49:51,070 --> 01:49:51,671
It's a living,

4247
01:49:51,671 --> 01:49:52,690
breathing thing.

4248
01:49:52,920 --> 01:49:53,230
Yeah.

4249
01:49:53,230 --> 01:49:54,190
And you're connected to it.

4250
01:49:54,450 --> 01:49:55,211
I'm upset.

4251
01:49:55,211 --> 01:49:56,210
I'm so she'd,

4252
01:49:56,370 --> 01:49:57,610
I'm playing with it the entire time.

4253
01:49:57,611 --> 01:49:57,850
We're on the,

4254
01:49:57,850 --> 01:49:58,060
no,

4255
01:49:58,060 --> 01:49:59,070
I have not had it off.

4256
01:49:59,130 --> 01:49:59,530
Yeah,

4257
01:49:59,530 --> 01:50:00,281
I see what you're doing.

4258
01:50:00,281 --> 01:50:00,731
If anybody,

4259
01:50:00,731 --> 01:50:02,380
but I can't read this far away by tweets.

4260
01:50:02,381 --> 01:50:02,580
You,

4261
01:50:02,580 --> 01:50:03,730
you can't read these in the show.

4262
01:50:03,731 --> 01:50:04,720
I can't read from this far away.

4263
01:50:04,750 --> 01:50:05,583
Are Your eyes going?

4264
01:50:05,850 --> 01:50:06,683
They were gone.

4265
01:50:06,720 --> 01:50:08,140
I had gone and I patch
when I was a little,

4266
01:50:08,320 --> 01:50:11,890
you had to wear an eye patch and I
have a one week I and it knows you're a

4267
01:50:11,891 --> 01:50:12,724
pirate.

4268
01:50:12,850 --> 01:50:13,200
Ooh.

4269
01:50:13,200 --> 01:50:14,470
Everything I could read.

4270
01:50:14,500 --> 01:50:15,190
If I do that,

4271
01:50:15,190 --> 01:50:16,030
I can read it.

4272
01:50:16,180 --> 01:50:17,013
Barely.

4273
01:50:17,520 --> 01:50:18,100
Um,

4274
01:50:18,100 --> 01:50:18,431
I want,

4275
01:50:18,431 --> 01:50:21,010
I told you before the show that I wanted
to talk to you about this video that I

4276
01:50:21,011 --> 01:50:26,011
saw because traditional male and
female roles and the arguments,

4277
01:50:26,171 --> 01:50:29,770
the traditional male female arguments
are so fucking stupid to me.

4278
01:50:29,810 --> 01:50:32,830
I get so upset when people get in.

4279
01:50:32,831 --> 01:50:36,100
These men do this and women want this.

4280
01:50:36,340 --> 01:50:38,620
Women why Comedy Act No.

4281
01:50:38,910 --> 01:50:39,910
Like this comedy.

4282
01:50:39,911 --> 01:50:40,744
But then there's these,

4283
01:50:40,750 --> 01:50:45,750
these generally's generalizations that
one of the things that I hate about talk

4284
01:50:45,851 --> 01:50:46,870
shows or about,

4285
01:50:46,900 --> 01:50:47,201
uh,

4286
01:50:47,201 --> 01:50:47,501
you know,

4287
01:50:47,501 --> 01:50:51,240
one of those CNN things where they have
people debate and I split screen the

4288
01:50:51,241 --> 01:50:52,810
split screen debates or God,

4289
01:50:52,811 --> 01:50:54,910
they're fucking five minutes
or whatever they are.

4290
01:50:55,120 --> 01:50:57,910
You're not going to get to
the heart of any matter.

4291
01:50:57,911 --> 01:51:02,911
And most of the time there's a little
bit of correctness on both sides.

4292
01:51:04,090 --> 01:51:05,560
Both sides have points,

4293
01:51:05,590 --> 01:51:06,340
both sides of,

4294
01:51:06,340 --> 01:51:08,140
and everyone's just trying to win.

4295
01:51:08,260 --> 01:51:08,651
And this,

4296
01:51:08,651 --> 01:51:10,690
this video that I sent that Jamie,

4297
01:51:10,720 --> 01:51:11,553
you got that video right?

4298
01:51:12,220 --> 01:51:12,880
This videos?

4299
01:51:12,880 --> 01:51:13,300
Yup.

4300
01:51:13,300 --> 01:51:15,130
Perfect example of this.

4301
01:51:15,310 --> 01:51:16,001
The weirdness.

4302
01:51:16,001 --> 01:51:17,230
You could see it up
here and you'll hear it.

4303
01:51:17,270 --> 01:51:18,103
[inaudible] headphones.

4304
01:51:18,130 --> 01:51:21,820
The perfect example of the
fucking weirdness that exists in,

4305
01:51:21,830 --> 01:51:26,830
in human beings when it comes to male,

4306
01:51:26,920 --> 01:51:31,250
female relationships are women
unhappier because of money.

4307
01:51:31,251 --> 01:51:33,190
And now this is the debate that these,

4308
01:51:33,191 --> 01:51:33,580
uh,

4309
01:51:33,580 --> 01:51:34,560
these people were having

4310
01:51:34,930 --> 01:51:39,930
no study out today that says women
become on happy as they get older.

4311
01:51:39,931 --> 01:51:40,171
Well,

4312
01:51:40,171 --> 01:51:41,370
the flip side,

4313
01:51:41,670 --> 01:51:44,100
men get happier as life goes on.

4314
01:51:44,180 --> 01:51:45,080
Pause it for a second.

4315
01:51:45,890 --> 01:51:46,723
Hold on.

4316
01:51:46,730 --> 01:51:47,241
First of all,

4317
01:51:47,241 --> 01:51:48,770
I fucking hate studies.

4318
01:51:49,400 --> 01:51:50,233
Those kinds of stuff.

4319
01:51:50,700 --> 01:51:51,291
Study was from,

4320
01:51:51,291 --> 01:51:51,741
first of all,

4321
01:51:51,741 --> 01:51:55,310
I don't mind clinical studies on
drugs and chemicals and you know,

4322
01:51:55,460 --> 01:51:56,480
those things make sense,

4323
01:51:56,600 --> 01:52:00,340
but study fine said women are
sadder and men are happier.

4324
01:52:00,380 --> 01:52:02,510
Survey I conducted on
the toilet this morning,

4325
01:52:02,570 --> 01:52:06,530
I find those things to be bullshit ways
to start conversations about things and

4326
01:52:06,531 --> 01:52:09,500
provoke arguments that are designed to
get ratings on fucking shitty talk show.

4327
01:52:09,501 --> 01:52:09,770
I was like,

4328
01:52:09,770 --> 01:52:09,981
sure.

4329
01:52:09,981 --> 01:52:11,030
I mean that's what a lot of it is.

4330
01:52:11,060 --> 01:52:11,990
We are the word study and we're like,

4331
01:52:12,020 --> 01:52:12,280
Ooh,

4332
01:52:12,280 --> 01:52:13,340
scientifically legitimate.

4333
01:52:13,370 --> 01:52:13,521
Well,

4334
01:52:13,521 --> 01:52:14,354
not only that,

4335
01:52:14,570 --> 01:52:15,240
who they talked to,

4336
01:52:15,240 --> 01:52:15,831
did they talk to you?

4337
01:52:15,831 --> 01:52:17,280
Eliza swessinger did not help to me.

4338
01:52:17,281 --> 01:52:18,320
He didn't talk to me either.

4339
01:52:18,460 --> 01:52:19,221
They didn't talk to anybody.

4340
01:52:19,221 --> 01:52:23,420
I know I fucking hate surveys because
I think that surveys do not give you an

4341
01:52:23,450 --> 01:52:27,230
accurate assessment of what most people
want or the belief they give you an

4342
01:52:27,231 --> 01:52:31,130
assessment of people dumb enough to
answer surveys who were at like an outdoor

4343
01:52:31,131 --> 01:52:31,590
mall.

4344
01:52:31,590 --> 01:52:31,760
Yeah,

4345
01:52:31,760 --> 01:52:32,830
like a dollar the answer yet.

4346
01:52:32,831 --> 01:52:33,664
And they're idiots.

4347
01:52:33,790 --> 01:52:35,720
But for the most part
you're dealing with dummies.

4348
01:52:36,410 --> 01:52:37,040
Okay.

4349
01:52:37,040 --> 01:52:38,420
Couple of economists by the way.

4350
01:52:38,421 --> 01:52:40,250
They say it happens when we eat.

4351
01:52:40,251 --> 01:52:43,670
Christmas wig looks great
and all of the major factors.

4352
01:52:43,671 --> 01:52:46,490
I'm coming down all about money now.

4353
01:52:46,780 --> 01:52:47,780
What's that all about?

4354
01:52:47,781 --> 01:52:49,280
We're going to the faded mark.

4355
01:52:49,281 --> 01:52:54,140
Rudolph is a no nonsense man and Tracy
burns are Fox business reporter joins me

4356
01:52:54,141 --> 01:52:55,610
to tell us what's really going on.

4357
01:52:56,390 --> 01:52:57,100
Tracy.

4358
01:52:57,100 --> 01:52:57,933
This is true.

4359
01:52:58,890 --> 01:52:59,760
Come on.

4360
01:53:00,410 --> 01:53:00,841
All right.

4361
01:53:00,841 --> 01:53:01,674
First of all,

4362
01:53:02,620 --> 01:53:03,630
they know you've missed me,

4363
01:53:03,631 --> 01:53:04,050
mark.

4364
01:53:04,050 --> 01:53:04,621
First of all,

4365
01:53:04,621 --> 01:53:08,850
this study was conducted by mostly
men and when men conduct anything,

4366
01:53:08,851 --> 01:53:12,420
they talk about their finances
because men judge themselves by this,

4367
01:53:12,480 --> 01:53:14,370
the size of their wallet.

4368
01:53:14,371 --> 01:53:15,204
Toys,

4369
01:53:15,270 --> 01:53:16,290
dare I say

4370
01:53:16,580 --> 01:53:16,730
no,

4371
01:53:16,730 --> 01:53:17,540
hold on.

4372
01:53:17,540 --> 01:53:18,373
Yeah.

4373
01:53:18,430 --> 01:53:20,140
How crazy is that when men do this,

4374
01:53:20,141 --> 01:53:20,974
men do that.

4375
01:53:21,500 --> 01:53:22,480
Not all men do that,

4376
01:53:22,481 --> 01:53:23,020
dummy.

4377
01:53:23,020 --> 01:53:23,853
Knowing that,

4378
01:53:23,960 --> 01:53:24,631
do you have to mean,

4379
01:53:24,631 --> 01:53:24,841
look,

4380
01:53:24,841 --> 01:53:25,320
if we,

4381
01:53:25,320 --> 01:53:27,060
if we harped on specifics,

4382
01:53:27,061 --> 01:53:27,990
we would never get any worse.

4383
01:53:27,991 --> 01:53:30,420
So it's not an incorrect generalization.

4384
01:53:30,510 --> 01:53:32,650
I do think men do.

4385
01:53:32,651 --> 01:53:37,140
I mean most see fortune 500 company Ceos
are men and I do think that's a huge

4386
01:53:37,141 --> 01:53:37,771
thing for men.

4387
01:53:37,771 --> 01:53:38,400
That is how it it.

4388
01:53:38,400 --> 01:53:41,300
He because we can't fight with
swords and shields anymore.

4389
01:53:41,430 --> 01:53:43,590
Like that is a way that
men judge each other.

4390
01:53:43,670 --> 01:53:44,503
They certainly do.

4391
01:53:44,510 --> 01:53:45,530
And women do as well.

4392
01:53:45,531 --> 01:53:46,880
And that's this guy's point.

4393
01:53:46,940 --> 01:53:48,560
Some women do some.

4394
01:53:48,730 --> 01:53:49,160
Um,

4395
01:53:49,160 --> 01:53:53,810
but the idea that this
study was definitely done by
men and it's judge judging

4396
01:53:53,811 --> 01:53:54,350
men.

4397
01:53:54,350 --> 01:53:56,510
The women are unhappy
because they get older.

4398
01:53:56,511 --> 01:53:56,990
It's like,

4399
01:53:56,990 --> 01:53:57,890
but I think you're judging.

4400
01:53:57,950 --> 01:53:58,161
Okay.

4401
01:53:58,161 --> 01:53:58,371
Sorry,

4402
01:53:58,371 --> 01:53:58,720
go ahead.

4403
01:53:58,720 --> 01:53:58,970
No,

4404
01:53:58,970 --> 01:53:59,701
let's let it play out.

4405
01:53:59,701 --> 01:54:01,010
I just let it play out because it's,

4406
01:54:01,011 --> 01:54:01,281
it's,

4407
01:54:01,281 --> 01:54:02,114
it's fascinating

4408
01:54:02,330 --> 01:54:03,600
and it's makes you happy.

4409
01:54:03,601 --> 01:54:06,780
If they were to ask other questions
in this study about spirituality,

4410
01:54:06,781 --> 01:54:09,810
about the other aspects of our lives
that women would have taken over.

4411
01:54:09,990 --> 01:54:10,291
I mean,

4412
01:54:10,291 --> 01:54:10,741
first of all,

4413
01:54:10,741 --> 01:54:13,740
a woman has her sexual prime at
35 things get much better for us.

4414
01:54:13,750 --> 01:54:14,091
Hey,

4415
01:54:14,091 --> 01:54:16,110
I made 35 this is good.

4416
01:54:17,180 --> 01:54:18,013
Alright.

4417
01:54:18,630 --> 01:54:18,990
Alright,

4418
01:54:18,990 --> 01:54:20,940
go nuts cause I know
you're going to go nuts.

4419
01:54:22,050 --> 01:54:22,883
Good one.

4420
01:54:23,070 --> 01:54:23,280
Yeah.

4421
01:54:23,280 --> 01:54:24,091
Well first of all,

4422
01:54:24,091 --> 01:54:28,080
you're presuming that the unhappiness
and women begins in middle age.

4423
01:54:28,560 --> 01:54:30,900
I'd say it starts when
she's a little girl.

4424
01:54:31,320 --> 01:54:34,380
When she stopped that
happiness derives from shoes,

4425
01:54:34,381 --> 01:54:35,071
jewelry,

4426
01:54:35,071 --> 01:54:35,461
Boob,

4427
01:54:35,461 --> 01:54:35,941
jobs,

4428
01:54:35,941 --> 01:54:36,590
and pedal.

4429
01:54:36,590 --> 01:54:37,423
Okay,

4430
01:54:37,450 --> 01:54:38,180
stop right there.

4431
01:54:38,180 --> 01:54:38,450
Okay.

4432
01:54:38,450 --> 01:54:39,730
He's a fucking idiot too.

4433
01:54:40,370 --> 01:54:43,250
That's an idiotic thing to say that
they're unhappy from the time they're a

4434
01:54:43,251 --> 01:54:43,880
little girl.

4435
01:54:43,880 --> 01:54:44,031
No,

4436
01:54:44,031 --> 01:54:44,211
no.

4437
01:54:44,211 --> 01:54:45,500
Some of them are happy as fuck.

4438
01:54:45,501 --> 01:54:46,130
You know,

4439
01:54:46,130 --> 01:54:50,270
he's weird generalizations to try to
prove your point or to make like your

4440
01:54:50,271 --> 01:54:50,721
gender,

4441
01:54:50,721 --> 01:54:51,650
the correct one.

4442
01:54:51,651 --> 01:54:53,030
Like it's men versus women.

4443
01:54:53,060 --> 01:54:53,930
All right.

4444
01:54:54,020 --> 01:54:55,070
Versus all women.

4445
01:54:55,250 --> 01:54:56,390
It's so dumb.

4446
01:54:56,480 --> 01:54:57,200
Okay.

4447
01:54:57,200 --> 01:54:58,430
First it drives me crazy.

4448
01:54:58,460 --> 01:54:59,230
First of all,

4449
01:54:59,230 --> 01:55:00,250
I disagree with you.

4450
01:55:00,251 --> 01:55:01,590
I do think we need generalizations.

4451
01:55:01,700 --> 01:55:03,610
We couldn't have comedy
without generalizations.

4452
01:55:03,640 --> 01:55:03,791
Well,

4453
01:55:03,791 --> 01:55:06,460
we have some generalizations
for the sake of comedy,

4454
01:55:06,490 --> 01:55:07,510
but it comes up.

4455
01:55:07,630 --> 01:55:10,600
That guy's awful and that woman is off.

4456
01:55:10,601 --> 01:55:12,610
Like those people are horrible people.

4457
01:55:12,611 --> 01:55:13,460
So it's not a horrible yeah,

4458
01:55:13,510 --> 01:55:13,721
Bay,

4459
01:55:13,721 --> 01:55:14,860
but they're horrible people.

4460
01:55:15,480 --> 01:55:16,270
Uh,

4461
01:55:16,270 --> 01:55:18,720
he is not wrong and it is,

4462
01:55:18,760 --> 01:55:19,270
I mean,

4463
01:55:19,270 --> 01:55:20,021
he's not wrong.

4464
01:55:20,021 --> 01:55:20,801
It does start younger.

4465
01:55:20,801 --> 01:55:25,801
I do think girls are conditioned to be
less happy with themselves and to compete

4466
01:55:25,931 --> 01:55:28,750
with each other in an unhealthy
way from a very young age.

4467
01:55:28,990 --> 01:55:30,670
But I don't think women are unhappy.

4468
01:55:31,030 --> 01:55:32,290
But I do think that there are,

4469
01:55:32,840 --> 01:55:33,673
there are more,

4470
01:55:33,910 --> 01:55:36,730
there's more variables that women have
to deal with in terms of like body

4471
01:55:36,731 --> 01:55:37,564
issues,

4472
01:55:37,690 --> 01:55:38,411
competition,

4473
01:55:38,411 --> 01:55:39,244
that is,

4474
01:55:39,340 --> 01:55:40,780
that originates from women.

4475
01:55:40,781 --> 01:55:41,710
Less about men.

4476
01:55:41,711 --> 01:55:43,400
Like we think we're
always competing with men.

4477
01:55:43,430 --> 01:55:44,070
We're really competing

4478
01:55:44,070 --> 01:55:44,611
with other women.

4479
01:55:44,611 --> 01:55:46,380
So I don't think he's
wrong and saying that,

4480
01:55:46,640 --> 01:55:47,550
but he's saying there,

4481
01:55:47,850 --> 01:55:48,061
yeah,

4482
01:55:48,061 --> 01:55:48,894
he's definitely awful.

4483
01:55:48,960 --> 01:55:50,640
But they're saying that they're unhappy.

4484
01:55:50,641 --> 01:55:51,870
He's awful in these,

4485
01:55:52,110 --> 01:55:52,380
well,

4486
01:55:52,380 --> 01:55:53,570
it's like these are the,

4487
01:55:53,571 --> 01:55:55,080
also these are such inflammatory,

4488
01:55:55,081 --> 01:55:55,261
I mean,

4489
01:55:55,261 --> 01:55:58,120
I don't want to judge any of these people
because it's not a real conversation

4490
01:55:58,150 --> 01:56:02,640
that it's awful in these
inflammatory bursts of information.

4491
01:56:03,060 --> 01:56:05,610
It's like at a certain point in time,

4492
01:56:05,790 --> 01:56:06,151
you know,

4493
01:56:06,151 --> 01:56:11,151
you have to stop doing these fucking five
minute conversations translates to the

4494
01:56:11,311 --> 01:56:13,530
carpet warehouse business.

4495
01:56:13,531 --> 01:56:15,770
We're here on Fox business trying
to get to the heart of the matter.

4496
01:56:15,790 --> 01:56:18,000
Why girls are unhappy.

4497
01:56:18,050 --> 01:56:18,220
Oh,

4498
01:56:18,220 --> 01:56:19,320
I mean it's all garbage.

4499
01:56:19,410 --> 01:56:19,771
I mean,

4500
01:56:19,771 --> 01:56:20,310
most of this,

4501
01:56:20,310 --> 01:56:22,950
all of this is just to
to pay for advertising.

4502
01:56:22,970 --> 01:56:23,220
Yeah.

4503
01:56:23,220 --> 01:56:24,053
Like a buzzfeed,

4504
01:56:24,080 --> 01:56:26,400
like top 10 top 10 brick colors.

4505
01:56:26,401 --> 01:56:26,971
You should see.

4506
01:56:26,971 --> 01:56:29,400
And the reason why Jennifer
Aniston will never be happy.

4507
01:56:29,430 --> 01:56:30,263
Like what?

4508
01:56:30,300 --> 01:56:31,680
Press press play there,

4509
01:56:32,100 --> 01:56:32,930
Jamie.

4510
01:56:32,930 --> 01:56:33,610
Interesting.

4511
01:56:33,610 --> 01:56:33,911
Oh,

4512
01:56:33,911 --> 01:56:34,391
come on,

4513
01:56:34,391 --> 01:56:35,224
I'll Alexis.

4514
01:56:35,320 --> 01:56:39,670
And then you have boys who are taught
that they're supposed to make girls happy.

4515
01:56:39,730 --> 01:56:42,010
I was on the radio two
weeks ago in Greensboro,

4516
01:56:42,040 --> 01:56:42,880
North Carolina,

4517
01:56:42,881 --> 01:56:45,130
and the host related a story.

4518
01:56:45,220 --> 01:56:47,680
He overheard his son and daughter talking.

4519
01:56:48,010 --> 01:56:50,080
So brother goes to sister and says,

4520
01:56:50,260 --> 01:56:51,640
how come you always have money?

4521
01:56:51,641 --> 01:56:52,474
And I don't.

4522
01:56:52,840 --> 01:56:53,500
And she says,

4523
01:56:53,500 --> 01:56:54,333
that's simple.

4524
01:56:54,700 --> 01:56:56,920
I have a boyfriend and
you have a girlfriend.

4525
01:56:57,340 --> 01:56:58,660
The fact of the matter is,

4526
01:56:59,110 --> 01:56:59,480
boy,

4527
01:56:59,480 --> 01:57:00,110
your pocket,

4528
01:57:00,110 --> 01:57:01,520
they're supposed to make women happy.

4529
01:57:03,070 --> 01:57:04,490
I mean the people that watch Fox,

4530
01:57:05,190 --> 01:57:05,740
no,

4531
01:57:05,740 --> 01:57:07,090
not living in the dark ages.

4532
01:57:07,091 --> 01:57:07,871
This is reality.

4533
01:57:07,871 --> 01:57:10,990
And if either of you women
has ever dated women,

4534
01:57:11,020 --> 01:57:12,640
you would know what I'm talking about.

4535
01:57:12,850 --> 01:57:15,110
But you pretend that you
don't know what I'm about.

4536
01:57:15,590 --> 01:57:15,880
What?

4537
01:57:15,880 --> 01:57:17,350
What's happening in middle age,

4538
01:57:17,890 --> 01:57:18,490
what's happening?

4539
01:57:18,490 --> 01:57:22,980
What's happening in middle age here is
that women who bring 70% of divorces are

4540
01:57:22,990 --> 01:57:25,780
divorcing the men that they never
wanted the marriage to begin with.

4541
01:57:25,930 --> 01:57:28,060
And so now that's what's
making the men happy.

4542
01:57:28,280 --> 01:57:31,120
That's the green because we
control the household spending,

4543
01:57:31,121 --> 01:57:31,500
don't we?

4544
01:57:31,500 --> 01:57:33,310
Cause we were working more than ever.

4545
01:57:33,410 --> 01:57:33,580
All right,

4546
01:57:33,580 --> 01:57:34,850
let's get back to the surveys.

4547
01:57:35,150 --> 01:57:35,690
Right?

4548
01:57:35,690 --> 01:57:40,330
Because basically what they're saying
is that we are happy here in our early

4549
01:57:40,331 --> 01:57:45,331
adult life and that women are more likely
than men to fulfill their aspirations

4550
01:57:45,760 --> 01:57:48,460
earlier related to
material goods and family.

4551
01:57:48,850 --> 01:57:52,980
That is true when you say true because
you can't have a baby when you're 60 men

4552
01:57:52,990 --> 01:57:54,670
longer to figure out what
they want to do in life.

4553
01:57:54,770 --> 01:57:55,000
Well,

4554
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:58,660
I just think this whole notion of
basing your happiness on material goods,

4555
01:57:58,661 --> 01:57:59,650
it's part of the problem.

4556
01:57:59,830 --> 01:58:02,470
Hence part of the reason that this
thing was run by men in the first place.

4557
01:58:02,480 --> 01:58:03,350
You know what I'm arguing,

4558
01:58:03,730 --> 01:58:04,300
she's right.

4559
01:58:04,300 --> 01:58:05,133
In some ways,

4560
01:58:05,410 --> 01:58:06,210
basing

4561
01:58:06,210 --> 01:58:09,370
your happiness on material
possessions is pretty foolhardy,

4562
01:58:09,790 --> 01:58:11,230
but the whole men thing,

4563
01:58:11,260 --> 01:58:13,060
that's why it's run by men like no,

4564
01:58:13,061 --> 01:58:15,520
it's run by people that
think in a silly way.

4565
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:17,230
You know this,

4566
01:58:17,231 --> 01:58:19,120
this men versus women argument,

4567
01:58:19,430 --> 01:58:19,680
it's,

4568
01:58:19,680 --> 01:58:19,891
I,

4569
01:58:19,891 --> 01:58:24,310
I fucking hate those kinds
of generalizations because
you're railing against the

4570
01:58:24,311 --> 01:58:26,770
way that this debate was set
up versus actual content.

4571
01:58:26,890 --> 01:58:31,750
While I'm reeling against these fucking
squatters chickens squawking NHL that

4572
01:58:33,010 --> 01:58:34,330
she had a terrible host.

4573
01:58:34,331 --> 01:58:34,641
Terrible.

4574
01:58:34,641 --> 01:58:35,980
The fact that I can't get a show,

4575
01:58:35,981 --> 01:58:36,491
but this,

4576
01:58:36,491 --> 01:58:38,200
somebody gave this meat puppet.

4577
01:58:38,230 --> 01:58:40,360
It's not that you can't get
a show Eliza slessinger.

4578
01:58:40,361 --> 01:58:40,851
You need a God.

4579
01:58:40,851 --> 01:58:41,684
Damn.

4580
01:58:41,800 --> 01:58:42,551
That's what you need.

4581
01:58:42,551 --> 01:58:44,230
Why don't you do a podcast
a lot the size you are.

4582
01:58:44,231 --> 01:58:45,160
You're a powerful woman.

4583
01:58:45,161 --> 01:58:46,650
Brought that up the other day to who?

4584
01:58:47,250 --> 01:58:48,940
My manager to fucking manager.

4585
01:58:48,941 --> 01:58:49,774
Just do it.

4586
01:58:49,840 --> 01:58:50,620
Why don't you just do it?

4587
01:58:50,620 --> 01:58:51,341
You could do it here.

4588
01:58:51,341 --> 01:58:52,510
I'll let you use my studio.

4589
01:58:53,890 --> 01:58:54,850
Can I take the hideaway?

4590
01:58:54,880 --> 01:58:56,740
You could get the throw
the thing in the garbage.

4591
01:58:56,920 --> 01:58:59,020
Well he's my friend gave it to
me so you can't throw it away.

4592
01:58:59,820 --> 01:59:00,700
You can put it away.

4593
01:59:00,730 --> 01:59:01,230
I would like to,

4594
01:59:01,230 --> 01:59:02,140
it doesn't have to look at it.

4595
01:59:02,270 --> 01:59:02,471
All right,

4596
01:59:02,471 --> 01:59:03,820
so your issue is with the way that this,

4597
01:59:03,821 --> 01:59:04,654
I mean those people are,

4598
01:59:05,040 --> 01:59:06,070
you are getting,

4599
01:59:06,071 --> 01:59:08,200
you said to me earlier like
why give something like bad?

4600
01:59:08,201 --> 01:59:08,591
Your energy.

4601
01:59:08,591 --> 01:59:10,360
These people are horrible and it's on Fox.

4602
01:59:10,390 --> 01:59:12,490
So I don't know what we were expecting.

4603
01:59:12,670 --> 01:59:13,030
Well,

4604
01:59:13,030 --> 01:59:14,470
we were expecting bad things,

4605
01:59:14,471 --> 01:59:15,070
but uh,

4606
01:59:15,070 --> 01:59:18,580
in analyzing bad things you can break
down what's so goofy about them.

4607
01:59:18,581 --> 01:59:21,700
And I think that there are
some clarity comes out of that.

4608
01:59:21,940 --> 01:59:23,450
So it's a let this guy like,

4609
01:59:24,070 --> 01:59:24,521
oh yeah,

4610
01:59:24,521 --> 01:59:25,390
it gets even goofier.

4611
01:59:25,420 --> 01:59:26,080
Okay.

4612
01:59:26,080 --> 01:59:27,430
This is why I wanted
to bring it up to you.

4613
01:59:28,270 --> 01:59:33,270
I felt like your personality is a uniquely
qualified to show the other side of

4614
01:59:34,011 --> 01:59:34,170
it.

4615
01:59:34,170 --> 01:59:35,003
Yeah.

4616
01:59:35,090 --> 01:59:35,711
And all they would,

4617
01:59:35,711 --> 01:59:40,040
I mean ask any woman if she went to her
car over her children and so you take

4618
01:59:40,041 --> 01:59:41,300
the kids any day.

4619
01:59:41,390 --> 01:59:43,370
Whereas I would question
a lot of men out there.

4620
01:59:43,440 --> 01:59:43,710
All right.

4621
01:59:43,710 --> 01:59:44,543
That's fine.

4622
01:59:45,040 --> 01:59:45,580
Fucking,

4623
01:59:45,580 --> 01:59:46,480
that's horrible.

4624
01:59:46,510 --> 01:59:47,800
That's such a dumb thing to say.

4625
01:59:47,860 --> 01:59:52,120
She had a chance to make a salient
point and she said something's really

4626
01:59:52,121 --> 01:59:52,630
horrible.

4627
01:59:52,630 --> 01:59:56,410
Any guy who would choose his car over
his kids should just vanish from the

4628
01:59:56,411 --> 01:59:56,800
planet.

4629
01:59:56,800 --> 01:59:57,860
Probably not as instantly.

4630
01:59:58,600 --> 02:00:00,070
Instantly vanished from the planet.

4631
02:00:00,640 --> 02:00:01,473
Yeah.

4632
02:00:02,740 --> 02:00:03,071
Mark,

4633
02:00:03,071 --> 02:00:03,890
let me tell you,

4634
02:00:03,890 --> 02:00:08,110
it is because we are stronger and we are
happier at the end of the day than most

4635
02:00:08,111 --> 02:00:08,471
men.

4636
02:00:08,471 --> 02:00:10,210
And that is factual and you know,

4637
02:00:10,211 --> 02:00:11,044
it's a heart thing.

4638
02:00:13,790 --> 02:00:15,570
I just wanted to die sooner

4639
02:00:21,410 --> 02:00:23,710
on the table if you
want to play this game,

4640
02:00:23,780 --> 02:00:24,613
right?

4641
02:00:24,950 --> 02:00:25,450
Yeah.

4642
02:00:25,450 --> 02:00:29,560
Women go around comparing their
engagement rings to show off.

4643
02:00:29,620 --> 02:00:32,030
Who got the most careful Tommy?

4644
02:00:32,080 --> 02:00:33,310
That women don't compete,

4645
02:00:35,950 --> 02:00:38,050
that Joe kind of stuff.

4646
02:00:38,051 --> 02:00:38,491
Mari,

4647
02:00:38,491 --> 02:00:39,190
knock it out.

4648
02:00:39,190 --> 02:00:41,320
Word compete on houses,

4649
02:00:41,321 --> 02:00:41,861
divorce,

4650
02:00:41,861 --> 02:00:42,694
settlements,

4651
02:00:42,790 --> 02:00:43,421
carrots,

4652
02:00:43,421 --> 02:00:44,470
country clubs.

4653
02:00:44,740 --> 02:00:46,960
Women compete on money all the time.

4654
02:00:46,961 --> 02:00:48,070
Give me a break

4655
02:00:50,320 --> 02:00:51,340
your life buddy.

4656
02:00:51,860 --> 02:00:52,730
How's that for a second?

4657
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:54,050
Just pretend the date.

4658
02:00:54,110 --> 02:00:56,690
Don't he's so disingenuine I agree.

4659
02:00:56,750 --> 02:00:58,880
But I also first there again,

4660
02:00:58,910 --> 02:00:59,351
I have to read her.

4661
02:00:59,351 --> 02:01:03,320
Write how horrible that Paula Abdul
looking one on the bottom is a nightmare.

4662
02:01:03,680 --> 02:01:04,421
She is disingenuous.

4663
02:01:04,421 --> 02:01:05,254
I 100%.

4664
02:01:05,300 --> 02:01:06,290
He's not wrong.

4665
02:01:06,650 --> 02:01:07,310
Uh,

4666
02:01:07,310 --> 02:01:09,260
he threw a punch so she threw one back.

4667
02:01:09,560 --> 02:01:10,341
Women do compete,

4668
02:01:10,341 --> 02:01:11,001
but so do men.

4669
02:01:11,001 --> 02:01:12,020
I think women do it,

4670
02:01:12,600 --> 02:01:13,040
uh,

4671
02:01:13,040 --> 02:01:13,851
on not a nit.

4672
02:01:13,851 --> 02:01:14,511
Pick your level,

4673
02:01:14,511 --> 02:01:18,440
but I don't think if you
look at the reasons that I'd
have to think about it for

4674
02:01:18,441 --> 02:01:18,790
the,

4675
02:01:18,790 --> 02:01:19,880
the reasons we're doing this,

4676
02:01:19,881 --> 02:01:22,580
I don't think that they
come from a horrible place.

4677
02:01:22,581 --> 02:01:23,600
And I think men play into it.

4678
02:01:23,601 --> 02:01:26,990
You're buying her that diamond ring
because you want to show how big your bank

4679
02:01:26,991 --> 02:01:30,080
account is and that you're
powerful and that she's worth,

4680
02:01:30,110 --> 02:01:30,321
I mean,

4681
02:01:30,321 --> 02:01:31,520
everybody's playing a part in this.

4682
02:01:31,521 --> 02:01:33,170
Nobody's innocent hundred percent.

4683
02:01:33,171 --> 02:01:34,490
And you're also dating.

4684
02:01:34,491 --> 02:01:37,700
You made the choice to
date that this is my issue.

4685
02:01:38,180 --> 02:01:40,160
He made the choice to date that

4686
02:01:40,160 --> 02:01:43,430
horrible woman who thinks the biggest
diamond in the world is a big deal.

4687
02:01:43,550 --> 02:01:45,390
So what does that say about
your decision making skills?

4688
02:01:45,420 --> 02:01:47,210
But when you first start dating someone,

4689
02:01:47,211 --> 02:01:49,490
oftentimes you don't know that
they're going to be a horrible person,

4690
02:01:49,491 --> 02:01:50,360
but they didn't go to Yale.

4691
02:01:50,361 --> 02:01:51,130
I fucking get that.

4692
02:01:51,130 --> 02:01:51,710
Exactly.

4693
02:01:51,710 --> 02:01:52,543
Uh,

4694
02:01:52,580 --> 02:01:53,000
no,

4695
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:53,570
you know,

4696
02:01:53,570 --> 02:01:53,740
yeah.

4697
02:01:53,740 --> 02:01:54,231
You know,

4698
02:01:54,231 --> 02:01:55,190
when that girl is horrible,

4699
02:01:55,191 --> 02:01:56,450
I see a lot of what you do,

4700
02:01:56,451 --> 02:01:59,390
but sometimes you're deep in it and
you're trying to like work it out anyway.

4701
02:01:59,420 --> 02:02:00,030
Like I know that I,

4702
02:02:00,030 --> 02:02:00,231
I,

4703
02:02:00,231 --> 02:02:02,450
this is the pot calling kettle black
because I can't talk about it cause I just

4704
02:02:02,451 --> 02:02:05,390
told you that horrible story that
not what you made an awesome story.

4705
02:02:05,470 --> 02:02:05,901
I awesome.

4706
02:02:05,901 --> 02:02:06,680
Sorry.

4707
02:02:06,680 --> 02:02:07,970
I think a lot of men,

4708
02:02:08,270 --> 02:02:09,103
um,

4709
02:02:09,290 --> 02:02:10,280
I think different parts,

4710
02:02:10,670 --> 02:02:13,670
men and women in different kinds of
simulation and that's just the truth.

4711
02:02:13,880 --> 02:02:18,880
Not all men need to be challenged by
like a smart girl or if or an intelligent

4712
02:02:19,101 --> 02:02:20,240
woman or something like that.

4713
02:02:20,630 --> 02:02:24,350
A lot of men are okay with like a dumb
hot girl that wants to like cook his

4714
02:02:24,351 --> 02:02:25,460
meals and just kind of be there.

4715
02:02:25,850 --> 02:02:26,690
A lot of men are okay with that.

4716
02:02:26,691 --> 02:02:30,470
George Harrison once said that all I
need from a woman is to be attracted to

4717
02:02:30,471 --> 02:02:30,800
her.

4718
02:02:30,800 --> 02:02:32,300
Everything else I can get from a man.

4719
02:02:32,450 --> 02:02:33,740
I do think a lot of men,

4720
02:02:33,930 --> 02:02:35,420
I don't even care if
that's wrong or right,

4721
02:02:35,421 --> 02:02:36,980
everyone is allowed to feel that way.

4722
02:02:36,981 --> 02:02:41,981
And I think men on the whole are on
the whole are more program that way and

4723
02:02:42,381 --> 02:02:44,000
women need a lot of external stimuli.

4724
02:02:44,050 --> 02:02:45,950
And this also plays into
the bedroom as well.

4725
02:02:46,100 --> 02:02:48,200
So you're not,

4726
02:02:48,201 --> 02:02:51,410
women need to be stimulated
by a man more by his mind,

4727
02:02:51,620 --> 02:02:52,880
respecting his mind,

4728
02:02:52,881 --> 02:02:53,870
respecting his,

4729
02:02:53,871 --> 02:02:54,430
uh,

4730
02:02:54,430 --> 02:02:54,891
his English.

4731
02:02:54,891 --> 02:02:55,724
You're a gold digger,

4732
02:02:55,750 --> 02:02:57,620
in which case you're awful
and you deserve nothing.

4733
02:02:57,810 --> 02:02:59,210
But I mean for me,

4734
02:02:59,211 --> 02:03:00,230
like if you're stupid,

4735
02:03:00,231 --> 02:03:01,400
even if you're the hottest guy ever,

4736
02:03:01,401 --> 02:03:02,600
like I can't write.

4737
02:03:02,660 --> 02:03:03,140
I can't.

4738
02:03:03,140 --> 02:03:08,100
Could you like make out with them and
take your top off or am I got 100 even?

4739
02:03:08,150 --> 02:03:09,680
I've been out with really
hot guys and I'm like,

4740
02:03:09,681 --> 02:03:10,880
I have to leave right now.

4741
02:03:10,910 --> 02:03:11,271
Right,

4742
02:03:11,271 --> 02:03:11,571
right,

4743
02:03:11,571 --> 02:03:11,841
right.

4744
02:03:11,841 --> 02:03:13,310
Cause you it's offensive.

4745
02:03:13,610 --> 02:03:13,850
Yeah.

4746
02:03:13,850 --> 02:03:14,151
Well I,

4747
02:03:14,151 --> 02:03:14,481
yeah,

4748
02:03:14,481 --> 02:03:15,740
I can totally get that.

4749
02:03:15,940 --> 02:03:16,370
Okay.

4750
02:03:16,370 --> 02:03:17,380
Keep going with that.

4751
02:03:18,260 --> 02:03:21,810
The stature of a lot of
men is measured in the car.

4752
02:03:21,811 --> 02:03:26,811
They drive the golf country club they
belong to and very much the place they

4753
02:03:28,471 --> 02:03:28,921
live in.

4754
02:03:28,921 --> 02:03:30,420
You have to admit that.

4755
02:03:30,570 --> 02:03:31,400
Yeah.

4756
02:03:31,400 --> 02:03:35,090
And whether or not their wives are
staying at home and not working.

4757
02:03:35,091 --> 02:03:37,100
That's exactly what I
said at the beginning,

4758
02:03:38,990 --> 02:03:41,990
that the way the men are taught
that they have to make women happy.

4759
02:03:42,090 --> 02:03:45,620
But the fact of the matter is
you can't make anybody happy.

4760
02:03:45,920 --> 02:03:47,630
You have to make yourself happy.

4761
02:03:47,670 --> 02:03:48,050
He's right.

4762
02:03:48,050 --> 02:03:50,030
Happiness is a byproduct of achievement.

4763
02:03:50,031 --> 02:03:52,070
So for women to say that they're unhappy,

4764
02:03:52,220 --> 02:03:53,330
it's their own fault.

4765
02:03:53,540 --> 02:03:54,950
Anybody who says he's unhappy,

4766
02:03:54,951 --> 02:03:55,784
it's his own fault.

4767
02:03:55,860 --> 02:03:58,100
Everybody has to make
himself or herself happy.

4768
02:03:58,500 --> 02:03:59,040
Bloody headed.

4769
02:03:59,040 --> 02:03:59,220
Yeah.

4770
02:03:59,220 --> 02:03:59,521
I mean,

4771
02:03:59,521 --> 02:04:00,450
how are you from?

4772
02:04:00,451 --> 02:04:02,620
Where are you from?

4773
02:04:02,660 --> 02:04:06,720
She says bloody like girls that they
have to grow up to be reliant on a man as

4774
02:04:06,721 --> 02:04:06,931
you can.

4775
02:04:06,931 --> 02:04:07,081
Well,

4776
02:04:07,081 --> 02:04:07,950
you can say that.

4777
02:04:08,190 --> 02:04:11,570
My son pray for your the same one.

4778
02:04:11,710 --> 02:04:11,980
Nope.

4779
02:04:11,980 --> 02:04:12,371
Same One.

4780
02:04:12,371 --> 02:04:16,300
Who bragged that she's so strong and so
tough and doesn't need a man's money?

4781
02:04:16,330 --> 02:04:16,581
Yeah,

4782
02:04:16,581 --> 02:04:17,830
you're taking alimony.

4783
02:04:19,900 --> 02:04:20,733
Oh,

4784
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:21,830
mark.

4785
02:04:21,830 --> 02:04:22,630
Oh,

4786
02:04:22,630 --> 02:04:23,463
he's wrong.

4787
02:04:23,540 --> 02:04:24,373
Sorry.

4788
02:04:24,600 --> 02:04:25,433
Hold on.

4789
02:04:25,470 --> 02:04:26,290
Sorry.

4790
02:04:26,290 --> 02:04:26,921
He's wrong.

4791
02:04:26,921 --> 02:04:27,490
How's he wrong?

4792
02:04:27,490 --> 02:04:32,020
Here's how he's wrong because
I've thought about this for you.

4793
02:04:32,021 --> 02:04:33,040
Raise these children together.

4794
02:04:33,400 --> 02:04:33,611
I mean,

4795
02:04:33,611 --> 02:04:34,660
you have these children together.

4796
02:04:34,661 --> 02:04:35,710
She gave up.

4797
02:04:36,020 --> 02:04:36,791
People aren't gonna like this,

4798
02:04:36,791 --> 02:04:37,624
but is the truth.

4799
02:04:37,950 --> 02:04:40,200
A woman has a finite amount
of time to have a baby.

4800
02:04:40,230 --> 02:04:41,010
Okay.

4801
02:04:41,010 --> 02:04:43,350
And a finite amount of time to
really be valuable in the workplace.

4802
02:04:43,351 --> 02:04:44,400
As unfortunate as it is,

4803
02:04:44,401 --> 02:04:45,121
that's the way it is.

4804
02:04:45,121 --> 02:04:46,350
Your youth is a commodity,

4805
02:04:46,590 --> 02:04:47,010
right?

4806
02:04:47,010 --> 02:04:49,500
When you enter into a contract
of marriage with someone,

4807
02:04:50,070 --> 02:04:53,940
you're giving up a big part of yourself
to either support that man and what he's

4808
02:04:53,941 --> 02:04:56,400
doing to have these children
to raise these children.

4809
02:04:56,580 --> 02:04:58,170
So part of that alimony is,

4810
02:04:58,171 --> 02:04:59,310
and this is just the way it is,

4811
02:04:59,700 --> 02:05:04,350
is sort of compensation for all those
years you invested in that he is still

4812
02:05:04,351 --> 02:05:07,980
going to be at 50 he can still be just
as valuable as he wasn't 25 for a woman.

4813
02:05:08,010 --> 02:05:09,510
It just isn't that way yet.

4814
02:05:10,320 --> 02:05:13,080
He should have to pay for the
children as much as she does.

4815
02:05:13,081 --> 02:05:14,070
She's the one raising them.

4816
02:05:14,430 --> 02:05:17,400
So his financial contribution is the
compensation for not physically being

4817
02:05:17,401 --> 02:05:17,790
there.

4818
02:05:17,790 --> 02:05:19,410
She's the one taking them
to doctor's appointments.

4819
02:05:19,411 --> 02:05:21,060
She's the one staying up
with them when they're sick.

4820
02:05:21,450 --> 02:05:21,840
I,

4821
02:05:21,840 --> 02:05:23,310
my mom was a single mom who,

4822
02:05:23,340 --> 02:05:25,320
I don't know what happened
with her Alamo situation,

4823
02:05:25,380 --> 02:05:27,840
but I don't think that that's wrong.

4824
02:05:28,050 --> 02:05:29,130
You can be a strong woman,

4825
02:05:29,131 --> 02:05:32,760
but he doesn't get to just dip out because
they had kids and they got a divorce.

4826
02:05:32,910 --> 02:05:37,200
I completely agree with you as far as
supporting the person who's taking care of

4827
02:05:37,201 --> 02:05:37,861
your children,

4828
02:05:37,861 --> 02:05:39,900
that you absolutely have to make a,

4829
02:05:40,410 --> 02:05:43,560
a financial contribution to that.

4830
02:05:43,561 --> 02:05:46,260
And I also think that alimony is a,

4831
02:05:46,261 --> 02:05:47,250
is a big part of that.

4832
02:05:47,290 --> 02:05:50,810
Not just child support but
compensating the woman for the,

4833
02:05:50,811 --> 02:05:53,130
the actual time that she has that you,

4834
02:05:53,131 --> 02:05:54,630
if you're not going to give the time,

4835
02:05:54,840 --> 02:05:55,890
if you're not going to be there,

4836
02:05:55,891 --> 02:05:56,220
you will.

4837
02:05:56,220 --> 02:05:57,810
You absolutely should give them money.

4838
02:05:57,840 --> 02:05:58,830
And My,

4839
02:05:58,831 --> 02:06:02,730
my issue with alimony really is
with people who don't have children,

4840
02:06:03,090 --> 02:06:04,260
women who don't have children.

4841
02:06:04,261 --> 02:06:07,830
I have a buddy who was
married to a woman for um,

4842
02:06:08,160 --> 02:06:09,960
when you're married for a
certain amount of years.

4843
02:06:09,961 --> 02:06:10,830
I don't know what the number is,

4844
02:06:10,831 --> 02:06:12,240
but he passed over that number.

4845
02:06:12,690 --> 02:06:15,090
It doesn't matter what your,

4846
02:06:15,240 --> 02:06:15,720
you know,

4847
02:06:15,720 --> 02:06:16,780
your status is.

4848
02:06:16,781 --> 02:06:17,640
It doesn't matter what it is.

4849
02:06:17,760 --> 02:06:18,571
You have to,

4850
02:06:18,571 --> 02:06:19,560
unless you have a prenuptial,

4851
02:06:19,561 --> 02:06:22,440
you have to take care of her for
the rest of her natural life.

4852
02:06:22,620 --> 02:06:23,453
It's like 12

4853
02:06:24,260 --> 02:06:25,220
that's ridiculous.

4854
02:06:25,400 --> 02:06:26,690
But to my point,

4855
02:06:27,090 --> 02:06:27,801
it's one thing,

4856
02:06:27,801 --> 02:06:30,830
I guess if you get married at 50 and
you read for five years and that's

4857
02:06:30,831 --> 02:06:31,161
different,

4858
02:06:31,161 --> 02:06:31,731
but okay,

4859
02:06:31,731 --> 02:06:31,941
let's,

4860
02:06:31,941 --> 02:06:32,840
let's look at this scenario.

4861
02:06:32,920 --> 02:06:37,240
Well I think he was married at 2020
I'm 22 or something like that and they

4862
02:06:37,241 --> 02:06:41,590
divorced when she was like
35 or something like that.

4863
02:06:41,591 --> 02:06:43,300
So she's still young enough to get a man,

4864
02:06:43,330 --> 02:06:45,490
but he has to take care of
her for the rest of her life.

4865
02:06:45,730 --> 02:06:47,920
And she's living in his old house.

4866
02:06:47,921 --> 02:06:51,820
He this fucking jam and house and the
Pacific Palisades overlooking the ocean.

4867
02:06:52,210 --> 02:06:53,830
W if she lives with a man,

4868
02:06:54,070 --> 02:06:56,590
she's no longer eligible
so she can't get married.

4869
02:06:56,680 --> 02:06:57,670
So she has a boyfriend,

4870
02:06:57,671 --> 02:07:01,030
but she will not marry the boyfriend
because my friend is wealthy and he has to

4871
02:07:01,031 --> 02:07:01,990
pay her a large sum.

4872
02:07:01,991 --> 02:07:04,840
So they play this game
where he has a lawyer,

4873
02:07:04,841 --> 02:07:05,890
go to the house and says,

4874
02:07:05,891 --> 02:07:06,701
you're living with a man.

4875
02:07:06,701 --> 02:07:07,001
She says,

4876
02:07:07,001 --> 02:07:07,181
no,

4877
02:07:07,181 --> 02:07:09,130
he's just staying the night
and he doesn't live here.

4878
02:07:09,131 --> 02:07:11,950
And then the guy has to move out and
they hire investigators to make sure that

4879
02:07:11,951 --> 02:07:13,390
this guy is not sleeping
over all the time.

4880
02:07:13,570 --> 02:07:16,480
So the guy tries to sneak in through
the fucking backyard to stay.

4881
02:07:16,481 --> 02:07:17,090
I mean,

4882
02:07:17,090 --> 02:07:17,923
it's incredible.

4883
02:07:18,380 --> 02:07:19,213
Um,

4884
02:07:19,400 --> 02:07:20,233
I,

4885
02:07:20,270 --> 02:07:21,170
that's terrible.

4886
02:07:21,290 --> 02:07:21,770
Yes.

4887
02:07:21,770 --> 02:07:22,940
Here's the other side of that.

4888
02:07:23,210 --> 02:07:24,043
And I'm not,

4889
02:07:25,070 --> 02:07:25,821
the older I get,

4890
02:07:25,821 --> 02:07:27,860
the more I'm able to see
both sides versus being like,

4891
02:07:27,861 --> 02:07:27,981
oh,

4892
02:07:27,981 --> 02:07:30,830
it's about not taking advantage
of med or being a strong woman.

4893
02:07:31,100 --> 02:07:34,340
Let's say you're 21 and you
get married and the guy says,

4894
02:07:34,400 --> 02:07:35,380
and you want you kids,

4895
02:07:35,381 --> 02:07:35,891
and the guy says,

4896
02:07:35,891 --> 02:07:36,010
I

4897
02:07:36,010 --> 02:07:36,730
don't want kids.

4898
02:07:36,730 --> 02:07:37,563
Okay.

4899
02:07:38,290 --> 02:07:39,550
And you get divorced at 35,

4900
02:07:40,090 --> 02:07:40,570
let's say,

4901
02:07:40,570 --> 02:07:41,261
let's say older,

4902
02:07:41,261 --> 02:07:41,471
younger,

4903
02:07:41,471 --> 02:07:42,100
whatever.

4904
02:07:42,100 --> 02:07:45,280
You've pretty much given up the
bulk of your child bearing years.

4905
02:07:45,550 --> 02:07:47,170
You will never have a family now and,

4906
02:07:47,260 --> 02:07:49,690
and you're divorced and you're
pretty much left with nothing.

4907
02:07:49,960 --> 02:07:51,210
And the years that you could have dick,

4908
02:07:51,250 --> 02:07:53,260
let's just say dedicated to
having a career or whatever.

4909
02:07:53,261 --> 02:07:55,600
Let's say you spent them supporting
going through medical school.

4910
02:07:55,930 --> 02:07:57,190
Let's say you were there for him.

4911
02:07:57,370 --> 02:07:59,050
And a lot of guys do this
and they leave their call.

4912
02:07:59,060 --> 02:07:59,893
A starter wife,

4913
02:08:00,400 --> 02:08:03,250
I don't know about being compensated for
the rest of your life but there should

4914
02:08:03,251 --> 02:08:07,180
be some compensation there for the
love and the pain and the support and

4915
02:08:07,181 --> 02:08:09,670
everything that you went through to
support that man who you thought was going

4916
02:08:09,671 --> 02:08:11,080
to be the rock for the rest of your life.

4917
02:08:11,110 --> 02:08:14,650
Well that's a very specific scenario
you're bringing up and that scenario isn't

4918
02:08:14,651 --> 02:08:17,320
covered by laws that are very generalized.

4919
02:08:17,380 --> 02:08:18,213
I do think,

4920
02:08:18,650 --> 02:08:20,590
oh there's generalities
nipping in the bud.

4921
02:08:20,591 --> 02:08:23,310
Again in that specific scenario,

4922
02:08:23,320 --> 02:08:24,910
woman putting a got
through medical school,

4923
02:08:24,920 --> 02:08:25,810
I absolutely agree with you.

4924
02:08:25,811 --> 02:08:27,820
She just supporting him
just being his wife.

4925
02:08:27,970 --> 02:08:29,720
Maybe she gave up having kids for him,

4926
02:08:29,750 --> 02:08:30,583
like there's certain,

4927
02:08:30,730 --> 02:08:31,590
if you will.

4928
02:08:31,690 --> 02:08:32,920
In this particular scenario,

4929
02:08:32,921 --> 02:08:34,480
this woman actually couldn't have kids.

4930
02:08:34,481 --> 02:08:37,240
She had a medical situation and one of
the reasons why they broke up was because

4931
02:08:37,241 --> 02:08:41,470
he wanted a family and she couldn't
have kids for whatever reason.

4932
02:08:41,530 --> 02:08:41,801
I mean,

4933
02:08:41,801 --> 02:08:43,550
I don't know what else they fought about,

4934
02:08:43,570 --> 02:08:46,390
but it wasn't a good
relationship in many ways.

4935
02:08:46,570 --> 02:08:48,000
So I bumped,

4936
02:08:48,001 --> 02:08:49,540
my friend is tortured by this.

4937
02:08:49,570 --> 02:08:49,871
Sure.

4938
02:08:49,871 --> 02:08:50,950
And she's a pariah.

4939
02:08:51,250 --> 02:08:52,083
And I do,

4940
02:08:52,090 --> 02:08:54,190
I think that for every
woman that does that,

4941
02:08:54,191 --> 02:08:57,610
it sort of takes away the legitimacy of
the argument that like women need to be

4942
02:08:57,611 --> 02:08:58,840
on their own and be strong.

4943
02:08:58,840 --> 02:09:01,090
And the alimony thing that he
brought up is absolute bullshit.

4944
02:09:01,240 --> 02:09:02,200
But like this woman,

4945
02:09:02,500 --> 02:09:05,680
if you have a boyfriend and like you're
pretty much stopping yourself from being

4946
02:09:05,681 --> 02:09:07,720
married and happy so you can have money.

4947
02:09:07,721 --> 02:09:08,770
You can live in an apartment.

4948
02:09:08,771 --> 02:09:10,450
You don't need to live in
a mansion in the Palisades.

4949
02:09:11,100 --> 02:09:14,410
She's terrible friend is rich and
she's making mad loot from him.

4950
02:09:14,411 --> 02:09:16,750
He pays her hundreds of
thousands of dollars a year.

4951
02:09:17,190 --> 02:09:18,220
That's a horrible law.

4952
02:09:18,590 --> 02:09:19,030
Uh,

4953
02:09:19,030 --> 02:09:20,020
that's is terrible.

4954
02:09:20,080 --> 02:09:21,700
And he has to pay her
for the rest of her life.

4955
02:09:21,760 --> 02:09:22,840
The rest of your life is ridiculous.

4956
02:09:22,841 --> 02:09:25,240
I can understand a couple of years
to get you back on your feet.

4957
02:09:25,241 --> 02:09:25,901
Go get a job,

4958
02:09:25,901 --> 02:09:27,460
but someone he needs to get a,

4959
02:09:27,760 --> 02:09:28,301
I don't know.

4960
02:09:28,301 --> 02:09:29,110
I don't know what he's going to do.

4961
02:09:29,110 --> 02:09:29,231
Well,

4962
02:09:29,231 --> 02:09:32,590
I can understand a couple of years to
get you on your feet as well because if

4963
02:09:32,591 --> 02:09:35,830
the guy's completely supporting you and
then all of a sudden he pulls the net

4964
02:09:35,831 --> 02:09:36,400
out from I do.

4965
02:09:36,400 --> 02:09:36,701
And you're like,

4966
02:09:36,701 --> 02:09:37,330
Holy Shit,

4967
02:09:37,330 --> 02:09:38,320
how do I feed myself?

4968
02:09:38,321 --> 02:09:39,340
I need to get a fucking job.

4969
02:09:39,640 --> 02:09:40,360
But you know,

4970
02:09:40,360 --> 02:09:41,890
if you're a grown human being,

4971
02:09:41,891 --> 02:09:45,370
you probably have some sort
of a occupational skill.

4972
02:09:45,420 --> 02:09:46,091
That's the other thing.

4973
02:09:46,091 --> 02:09:48,640
That's the argument for don't have you.

4974
02:09:48,750 --> 02:09:49,840
And she said this,

4975
02:09:50,110 --> 02:09:50,681
you raise,

4976
02:09:50,681 --> 02:09:52,240
you should raise your children to be,

4977
02:09:52,300 --> 02:09:54,300
to self support and not rely on it.

4978
02:09:54,310 --> 02:09:55,000
It's not about,

4979
02:09:55,000 --> 02:09:55,840
I don't need a man.

4980
02:09:55,841 --> 02:09:56,140
It's,

4981
02:09:56,140 --> 02:09:57,460
I like taking care of myself.

4982
02:09:57,461 --> 02:09:58,660
I would love a guy to take care of me,

4983
02:09:58,661 --> 02:10:00,250
but I'd also like to contribute.

4984
02:10:00,640 --> 02:10:01,480
I want to be married.

4985
02:10:01,481 --> 02:10:01,721
Of course,

4986
02:10:01,721 --> 02:10:02,920
it'd be great if you paid for vacation,

4987
02:10:02,921 --> 02:10:05,020
but I can also pay the
mortgage on the house.

4988
02:10:05,021 --> 02:10:05,854
Like it should be.

4989
02:10:06,130 --> 02:10:06,730
Uh,

4990
02:10:06,730 --> 02:10:08,440
it should be a bipartisan effort.

4991
02:10:08,650 --> 02:10:11,680
And if the person doesn't need you,

4992
02:10:11,980 --> 02:10:14,590
it's nice if you don't need each
other and find that more attractive.

4993
02:10:14,590 --> 02:10:14,921
I think,

4994
02:10:14,921 --> 02:10:17,830
I think weak men find it attractive
when a girl has to depend on them for

4995
02:10:17,831 --> 02:10:18,520
everything.

4996
02:10:18,520 --> 02:10:22,840
And I think any quality man respects a
woman that can buy her own things and

4997
02:10:22,841 --> 02:10:24,220
doesn't want anything from them.

4998
02:10:24,490 --> 02:10:24,701
Well,

4999
02:10:24,701 --> 02:10:27,160
especially if a guy's been
through a scenario like that,

5000
02:10:27,161 --> 02:10:29,560
like my friends scenario where
you're dealing with a woman,

5001
02:10:29,561 --> 02:10:31,780
it's just sponging off you
for the rest of your days.

5002
02:10:31,960 --> 02:10:32,171
I mean,

5003
02:10:32,171 --> 02:10:33,620
he's never going to
have sex with her again.

5004
02:10:33,621 --> 02:10:35,890
They're never hugging and
don't go on vacations together.

5005
02:10:35,891 --> 02:10:40,160
There's no loving kisses and he's sending
hundreds of thousands of dollars every

5006
02:10:40,160 --> 02:10:40,690
year her way.

5007
02:10:40,690 --> 02:10:41,450
You gotta be honest.

5008
02:10:41,450 --> 02:10:42,283
I'm sorry.

5009
02:10:42,620 --> 02:10:46,010
I think you could have spotted that she
was a little horrible from the get go.

5010
02:10:46,280 --> 02:10:48,020
People don't usually turn into that.

5011
02:10:48,030 --> 02:10:48,910
You're do.

5012
02:10:49,670 --> 02:10:52,520
This is where I disagree because
it's not a moral compass issue.

5013
02:10:52,670 --> 02:10:54,560
It's an issue of convenience for her.

5014
02:10:54,710 --> 02:10:55,870
Why should she go out and get more?

5015
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:56,270
Well,

5016
02:10:56,270 --> 02:10:57,260
it's not morals.

5017
02:10:57,440 --> 02:11:00,410
It's like if someone gives
you a lottery ticket and says,

5018
02:11:00,411 --> 02:11:01,010
Hey,

5019
02:11:01,010 --> 02:11:01,371
you know,

5020
02:11:01,371 --> 02:11:01,910
you,

5021
02:11:01,910 --> 02:11:03,530
you won the winning lottery.

5022
02:11:03,740 --> 02:11:04,130
Um,

5023
02:11:04,130 --> 02:11:05,930
but if you get this lottery ticket,

5024
02:11:05,960 --> 02:11:07,550
you really would never
going to have to work again.

5025
02:11:07,551 --> 02:11:08,900
You're probably not going
to pursue your career,

5026
02:11:08,901 --> 02:11:09,231
but hey,

5027
02:11:09,231 --> 02:11:10,280
you're going to have millions of dollars.

5028
02:11:10,281 --> 02:11:10,700
Now.

5029
02:11:10,700 --> 02:11:13,250
Most people are going to take those
millions of dollars and those millions of

5030
02:11:13,250 --> 02:11:15,890
dollars most likely are going
to fuck up your motivation.

5031
02:11:15,891 --> 02:11:16,580
They're gonna,

5032
02:11:16,580 --> 02:11:19,670
they're gonna make you look at money
and a completely different way.

5033
02:11:19,700 --> 02:11:21,170
It's a moral thing because if I said,

5034
02:11:21,171 --> 02:11:22,770
here's a lottery ticket and
you're going $1 million,

5035
02:11:23,210 --> 02:11:24,650
but it's going to seriously,

5036
02:11:25,010 --> 02:11:25,500
uh,

5037
02:11:25,500 --> 02:11:26,630
encumber an inconvenience,

5038
02:11:26,631 --> 02:11:29,180
somebody else who doesn't
deserve it necessarily rich,

5039
02:11:29,570 --> 02:11:30,403
he's rich,

5040
02:11:30,410 --> 02:11:31,340
why should he care?

5041
02:11:31,400 --> 02:11:31,611
I mean,

5042
02:11:31,611 --> 02:11:32,240
if he makes,

5043
02:11:32,240 --> 02:11:32,620
let's,

5044
02:11:32,620 --> 02:11:33,470
let's give them a number,

5045
02:11:33,471 --> 02:11:34,670
say $10 million a year.

5046
02:11:35,030 --> 02:11:36,380
If he makes $10 million a year,

5047
02:11:36,381 --> 02:11:39,080
why should he care if he has to
send 500 grand her way every year?

5048
02:11:39,110 --> 02:11:39,341
Okay,

5049
02:11:39,341 --> 02:11:40,174
so here's this then.

5050
02:11:40,430 --> 02:11:40,941
And here's why.

5051
02:11:40,941 --> 02:11:41,870
I think it's a moral thing.

5052
02:11:42,110 --> 02:11:44,460
There's also like an,

5053
02:11:44,461 --> 02:11:45,294
uh,

5054
02:11:45,530 --> 02:11:50,060
there's also the idea that like I find
it disgusting to have to rely on someone

5055
02:11:50,240 --> 02:11:52,250
that you don't have any use for.

5056
02:11:52,640 --> 02:11:54,200
A perfect example is the Yale thing.

5057
02:11:55,370 --> 02:11:56,390
The day I met him,

5058
02:11:56,780 --> 02:11:57,321
he would say,

5059
02:11:57,321 --> 02:11:57,841
this is where it has,

5060
02:11:57,841 --> 02:11:58,550
it all ties in.

5061
02:11:58,550 --> 02:11:59,121
He would say,

5062
02:11:59,121 --> 02:12:01,490
I have a billion miles
on whatever airline.

5063
02:12:01,730 --> 02:12:02,061
And he was like,

5064
02:12:02,061 --> 02:12:05,090
give me your itinerary and I will
upgrade you every time you fly.

5065
02:12:05,300 --> 02:12:05,660
And it's,

5066
02:12:05,660 --> 02:12:06,051
it's easy.

5067
02:12:06,051 --> 02:12:07,040
I've got all these free upgrades,

5068
02:12:07,041 --> 02:12:07,910
you may as well use them.

5069
02:12:08,270 --> 02:12:08,691
So I was like,

5070
02:12:08,691 --> 02:12:08,961
okay.

5071
02:12:08,961 --> 02:12:10,190
So when we started dating,

5072
02:12:10,191 --> 02:12:12,440
I would like to use the upgrades
and even after we broke up,

5073
02:12:12,441 --> 02:12:12,741
he was like,

5074
02:12:12,741 --> 02:12:14,210
I'd still like to keep
giving you upgrades.

5075
02:12:14,720 --> 02:12:17,060
I couldn't keep taking them.

5076
02:12:17,061 --> 02:12:18,560
I think I took like one more upgrade,

5077
02:12:19,080 --> 02:12:20,720
like while we were breaking up.

5078
02:12:20,750 --> 02:12:21,230
Right.

5079
02:12:21,230 --> 02:12:21,741
But I,

5080
02:12:21,741 --> 02:12:22,580
in that email I was like,

5081
02:12:22,581 --> 02:12:26,090
this is my resignation from the
upgrade program can go fuck yourself.

5082
02:12:26,390 --> 02:12:30,710
It's not worth it to me to fly first
class to be tied to you in any way,

5083
02:12:30,711 --> 02:12:31,251
shape or form.

5084
02:12:31,251 --> 02:12:33,440
And this woman is in a cosmic way.

5085
02:12:33,620 --> 02:12:38,180
Keeping yourself tethered to
this man and as a man dating her,

5086
02:12:38,181 --> 02:12:41,060
would you be comfortable like living in
some other dude's house with some other

5087
02:12:41,061 --> 02:12:41,601
Dude's money?

5088
02:12:41,601 --> 02:12:43,370
Like that's the whole thing is awful.

5089
02:12:43,371 --> 02:12:45,410
And so I do think it's a moral issue.

5090
02:12:45,770 --> 02:12:46,160
Um,

5091
02:12:46,160 --> 02:12:46,993
I see your point.

5092
02:12:47,120 --> 02:12:47,810
And um,

5093
02:12:47,810 --> 02:12:48,621
I would not,

5094
02:12:48,621 --> 02:12:50,410
but some men would broke.

5095
02:12:50,411 --> 02:12:51,011
Man would,

5096
02:12:51,011 --> 02:12:51,690
would.

5097
02:12:51,690 --> 02:12:52,523
Um,

5098
02:12:52,570 --> 02:12:52,911
you know,

5099
02:12:52,911 --> 02:12:57,140
I know a guy who's an actor who's
got this girl who takes care of them

5100
02:12:57,141 --> 02:12:57,680
completely.

5101
02:12:57,680 --> 02:13:02,060
She works all day and he just goes to
auditions and to disastrous relationship.

5102
02:13:02,061 --> 02:13:03,100
And I've watched it so like,

5103
02:13:03,410 --> 02:13:04,850
it's horrific to watch.

5104
02:13:04,851 --> 02:13:05,480
Cause like,

5105
02:13:05,480 --> 02:13:05,721
man,

5106
02:13:05,721 --> 02:13:06,920
if he ever does make it,

5107
02:13:06,950 --> 02:13:08,820
most likely he's going to bail for sure.

5108
02:13:09,890 --> 02:13:10,723
The whole thing is,

5109
02:13:10,800 --> 02:13:11,181
it's also,

5110
02:13:11,181 --> 02:13:13,970
there's a weird resentment that comes
from guy who's depending on a woman to

5111
02:13:13,971 --> 02:13:14,804
take care of them.

5112
02:13:15,440 --> 02:13:18,830
And depending on a woman who's
also depending on another man,

5113
02:13:18,831 --> 02:13:22,730
it's this weird fucking
entangles behavior.

5114
02:13:22,731 --> 02:13:24,410
And you see it in la all the time.

5115
02:13:25,670 --> 02:13:27,620
But I think in her eyes it's like,

5116
02:13:27,830 --> 02:13:28,550
Hey,

5117
02:13:28,550 --> 02:13:29,780
this guy can afford it.

5118
02:13:29,870 --> 02:13:30,740
Fuck him.

5119
02:13:30,860 --> 02:13:32,040
I gave him 12

5120
02:13:32,040 --> 02:13:34,790
years of my life and he
fucking left me because,

5121
02:13:35,310 --> 02:13:35,920
oh,

5122
02:13:35,920 --> 02:13:36,800
because then the kids think,

5123
02:13:37,220 --> 02:13:37,380
well,

5124
02:13:37,380 --> 02:13:39,000
I don't know to quite honestly,

5125
02:13:39,001 --> 02:13:39,834
he doesn't really,

5126
02:13:39,870 --> 02:13:40,441
I know they,

5127
02:13:40,441 --> 02:13:40,980
they,

5128
02:13:40,980 --> 02:13:42,750
they weren't getting along great.

5129
02:13:42,810 --> 02:13:45,080
It wasn't as simple as like the,

5130
02:13:45,090 --> 02:13:46,080
she was the love of his life,

5131
02:13:46,081 --> 02:13:47,010
but she couldn't have kids.

5132
02:13:47,011 --> 02:13:47,221
You know,

5133
02:13:47,221 --> 02:13:47,751
I dropped,

5134
02:13:47,751 --> 02:13:48,010
you know,

5135
02:13:48,010 --> 02:13:48,150
no,

5136
02:13:48,150 --> 02:13:48,983
it wasn't that.

5137
02:13:49,020 --> 02:13:49,620
It was,

5138
02:13:49,620 --> 02:13:51,060
there was a lot of other issues too,

5139
02:13:51,061 --> 02:13:54,210
but they were together long enough
and they were married young.

5140
02:13:54,211 --> 02:13:55,500
So there was that thing where like,

5141
02:13:55,501 --> 02:13:55,711
hey,

5142
02:13:55,711 --> 02:13:56,610
we're going to be together forever.

5143
02:13:56,611 --> 02:13:57,780
We don't need a prenuptial.

5144
02:13:57,840 --> 02:13:58,051
Right.

5145
02:13:58,051 --> 02:13:58,861
And now he,

5146
02:13:58,861 --> 02:14:00,960
if any of his friends or
even thinking about marriage,

5147
02:14:00,980 --> 02:14:02,610
he grabs him by the collar and says,

5148
02:14:02,611 --> 02:14:03,780
get up fucking prenuptial.

5149
02:14:03,930 --> 02:14:05,130
And he tells him the whole story

5150
02:14:05,480 --> 02:14:06,320
and he's an idiot.

5151
02:14:06,530 --> 02:14:07,363
Why?

5152
02:14:07,400 --> 02:14:09,980
Because he didn't have a prenup
and she was awful from the young,

5153
02:14:10,080 --> 02:14:10,520
well,

5154
02:14:10,520 --> 02:14:11,570
I promise you she was,

5155
02:14:11,910 --> 02:14:12,800
I promise you she was.

5156
02:14:12,801 --> 02:14:13,634
I can tell you,

5157
02:14:13,820 --> 02:14:16,760
I promise I could look at a woman
and tell you if she's horrible.

5158
02:14:16,960 --> 02:14:17,290
Let's,

5159
02:14:17,290 --> 02:14:18,160
let's say this.

5160
02:14:18,161 --> 02:14:23,161
Let's say you're both young and the guy
is like really ambitious and the woman

5161
02:14:23,561 --> 02:14:26,740
is an artist and you know she doesn't
make any money doing what she does,

5162
02:14:26,741 --> 02:14:28,090
but he supports that she does that.

5163
02:14:28,091 --> 02:14:28,990
Maybe she's a photographer,

5164
02:14:28,991 --> 02:14:32,170
let's say she's one of those artists
things where it's like really fucking hard

5165
02:14:32,171 --> 02:14:33,004
to make money.

5166
02:14:33,670 --> 02:14:34,070
Well,

5167
02:14:34,070 --> 02:14:35,920
I mean maybe she's in new
and maybe he doesn't care,

5168
02:14:36,190 --> 02:14:38,080
but then one day along the line,

5169
02:14:38,110 --> 02:14:39,880
12 years later he starts carrying,

5170
02:14:39,881 --> 02:14:40,151
he's like,

5171
02:14:40,151 --> 02:14:40,361
look,

5172
02:14:40,361 --> 02:14:41,110
it's over.

5173
02:14:41,110 --> 02:14:45,970
And now she has spent these 12 years
being taken care of and has never even

5174
02:14:45,971 --> 02:14:49,030
considered being able to
make a living on her own.

5175
02:14:49,710 --> 02:14:50,820
She's awful.

5176
02:14:51,300 --> 02:14:53,230
You don't give up your dream first of all.

5177
02:14:53,231 --> 02:14:55,440
And that goes back to what we
were talking about here you are,

5178
02:14:55,441 --> 02:14:56,730
are you a bad photographer?

5179
02:14:56,731 --> 02:14:57,930
And the guy,

5180
02:14:57,990 --> 02:14:59,550
men typically don't care if the girls bad.

5181
02:14:59,551 --> 02:15:03,270
I know plenty of men that like date female
comics and they're comics too and the

5182
02:15:03,271 --> 02:15:04,470
girl is horrible.

5183
02:15:04,500 --> 02:15:06,930
That's so common and the guys are over.

5184
02:15:06,931 --> 02:15:07,501
I don't care.

5185
02:15:07,501 --> 02:15:07,861
And I'm like,

5186
02:15:07,861 --> 02:15:11,310
I could never date a comic that told
horrible Dick Jokes for a living

5187
02:15:11,570 --> 02:15:13,790
that they take them on the road
with them and they have the girl.

5188
02:15:17,030 --> 02:15:18,080
Let's keep it on the DL.

5189
02:15:18,320 --> 02:15:18,830
But yeah,

5190
02:15:18,830 --> 02:15:21,260
I mean there's for every
Tom Segura and Christina,

5191
02:15:21,290 --> 02:15:23,180
Christina Pezeshki where
they're both hilarious.

5192
02:15:23,181 --> 02:15:23,540
Yes.

5193
02:15:23,540 --> 02:15:25,610
There's these scenarios where one of them,

5194
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:26,833
aw shit.

5195
02:15:26,910 --> 02:15:27,640
Absolutely.

5196
02:15:27,640 --> 02:15:29,040
They are the rare occasion,

5197
02:15:29,041 --> 02:15:29,281
I think.

5198
02:15:29,281 --> 02:15:29,491
Fine,

5199
02:15:29,491 --> 02:15:30,151
you're a photographer.

5200
02:15:30,151 --> 02:15:30,631
Let's say a good,

5201
02:15:30,631 --> 02:15:31,464
let's say you're bad.

5202
02:15:31,620 --> 02:15:36,620
What on this earth things you have the
right to stop trying to evolve as a

5203
02:15:37,111 --> 02:15:39,270
person just because you're married.

5204
02:15:39,660 --> 02:15:40,500
We'll meet it end.

5205
02:15:40,650 --> 02:15:41,940
Maybe he put it out there,

5206
02:15:41,970 --> 02:15:42,271
maybe.

5207
02:15:42,271 --> 02:15:42,601
He said,

5208
02:15:42,601 --> 02:15:42,841
look,

5209
02:15:42,841 --> 02:15:43,321
I love you.

5210
02:15:43,321 --> 02:15:44,340
You don't ever have to work again.

5211
02:15:44,440 --> 02:15:45,191
What are you doing though?

5212
02:15:45,191 --> 02:15:45,851
You don't have kids.

5213
02:15:45,851 --> 02:15:46,810
So what are you doing?

5214
02:15:46,840 --> 02:15:49,390
Lunching each taking care of
a little dog named blanche.

5215
02:15:52,930 --> 02:15:54,190
I still work in blanch ward.

5216
02:15:54,810 --> 02:15:55,840
Do you know what I'm saying?

5217
02:15:55,841 --> 02:15:55,951
I mean,

5218
02:15:55,951 --> 02:15:57,570
maybe she just does that.

5219
02:15:57,571 --> 02:15:58,404
And you know,

5220
02:15:58,590 --> 02:16:00,000
if you meet a woman here,

5221
02:16:00,001 --> 02:16:02,850
I'm gonna Give you how much fucking
yogurt can you do every day?

5222
02:16:02,851 --> 02:16:05,610
Do a little yoga every day and
then you recover and get a massage.

5223
02:16:05,910 --> 02:16:06,743
Manny petty,

5224
02:16:06,760 --> 02:16:08,880
I would feel like such a
beautiful book is there.

5225
02:16:08,881 --> 02:16:12,760
A girl does not read and
the secret doesn't count.

5226
02:16:13,540 --> 02:16:14,090
Let's see.

5227
02:16:14,090 --> 02:16:16,540
Can Either do magazine US weekly.

5228
02:16:16,541 --> 02:16:18,100
It doesn't count for reading.

5229
02:16:18,130 --> 02:16:18,671
I'm a reader.

5230
02:16:18,671 --> 02:16:19,441
I read a lot of,

5231
02:16:19,441 --> 02:16:19,810
uh,

5232
02:16:19,810 --> 02:16:20,030
cows,

5233
02:16:20,030 --> 02:16:21,190
his hamster cage lining,

5234
02:16:21,390 --> 02:16:22,240
hamster cage.

5235
02:16:22,270 --> 02:16:24,550
I take care of my hamsters gentleman.

5236
02:16:24,551 --> 02:16:27,520
If you meet a girl and she's willing
to take that and just be like,

5237
02:16:27,550 --> 02:16:27,911
I'll just,

5238
02:16:27,911 --> 02:16:28,360
and,

5239
02:16:28,360 --> 02:16:30,070
and she's not an active
role in the relationship,

5240
02:16:30,071 --> 02:16:31,870
but she's not taking care
of you and you're just,

5241
02:16:31,871 --> 02:16:33,130
and she's just pretty and that's it.

5242
02:16:34,010 --> 02:16:34,270
Okay.

5243
02:16:34,270 --> 02:16:37,050
But isn't there more to
life than just making money?

5244
02:16:37,051 --> 02:16:37,740
And if you,

5245
02:16:37,740 --> 02:16:41,160
you're in a relationship with someone
and you really truly feel like they're

5246
02:16:41,161 --> 02:16:42,300
going to be together forever,

5247
02:16:42,760 --> 02:16:44,720
we shouldn't that person
just to be able to there.

5248
02:16:45,090 --> 02:16:46,980
There's enough money
between the two of you.

5249
02:16:46,981 --> 02:16:48,960
Were both of your living very comfortably.

5250
02:16:49,080 --> 02:16:50,540
Shouldn't you be able
to do whatever you want?

5251
02:16:50,560 --> 02:16:51,060
Course?

5252
02:16:51,060 --> 02:16:51,301
Yeah,

5253
02:16:51,301 --> 02:16:51,870
sure.

5254
02:16:51,870 --> 02:16:52,381
Don't come.

5255
02:16:52,381 --> 02:16:54,420
Don't be upset when it comes back to
bite you in the bud that you don't have a

5256
02:16:54,421 --> 02:16:55,830
career 15 years later.

5257
02:16:55,900 --> 02:16:56,060
Right.

5258
02:16:56,060 --> 02:16:56,893
And he left you.

5259
02:16:57,240 --> 02:16:58,073
I also,

5260
02:16:58,440 --> 02:17:01,050
I mean I guess I just want to
know what she does during the day.

5261
02:17:01,300 --> 02:17:02,133
Like I,

5262
02:17:02,210 --> 02:17:03,690
I can kill a day looking at Facebook,

5263
02:17:03,870 --> 02:17:04,170
right?

5264
02:17:04,170 --> 02:17:05,003
But then the next day I'll be

5265
02:17:05,050 --> 02:17:05,351
busy.

5266
02:17:05,351 --> 02:17:06,490
Like what are you doing?

5267
02:17:06,880 --> 02:17:10,390
Well maybe she kills days looking at
Facebook and the next day she's not busy.

5268
02:17:10,391 --> 02:17:11,740
She just keeps looking at Facebook.

5269
02:17:11,800 --> 02:17:12,820
She's does what you do.

5270
02:17:12,821 --> 02:17:13,740
But always look,

5271
02:17:13,750 --> 02:17:15,850
I can't judge if somebody has a pea brain,

5272
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:17,680
but I don't.

5273
02:17:17,830 --> 02:17:18,850
These are awful people.

5274
02:17:19,470 --> 02:17:20,380
And you're terrible people.

5275
02:17:20,650 --> 02:17:20,861
Well,

5276
02:17:20,861 --> 02:17:22,150
one one's terrible,

5277
02:17:22,180 --> 02:17:22,631
my friends,

5278
02:17:22,631 --> 02:17:23,441
not terrible friends.

5279
02:17:23,441 --> 02:17:24,160
A little terrible.

5280
02:17:24,160 --> 02:17:24,970
Why is he terrible?

5281
02:17:24,970 --> 02:17:25,601
Fred's little terrible.

5282
02:17:25,601 --> 02:17:26,880
Cause he married her and she was,

5283
02:17:27,020 --> 02:17:28,720
oh come on.

5284
02:17:28,721 --> 02:17:29,830
I don't know about that.

5285
02:17:29,831 --> 02:17:32,230
When you were in your 20s
you don't fucking know shit.

5286
02:17:32,590 --> 02:17:35,560
I mean you couldn't figure out a guy was
full of shit and you're 30 and smart.

5287
02:17:35,920 --> 02:17:37,090
I figured it out though.

5288
02:17:37,160 --> 02:17:40,900
You figured it out eventually after a lot
of cross examination and investigative

5289
02:17:40,901 --> 02:17:42,730
work involving your mother as well

5290
02:17:43,140 --> 02:17:43,590
theirself.

5291
02:17:43,590 --> 02:17:44,423
And second of all,

5292
02:17:45,050 --> 02:17:46,100
she always involves herself.

5293
02:17:46,430 --> 02:17:46,971
Second of all,

5294
02:17:46,971 --> 02:17:49,340
what is a mental disorder?

5295
02:17:49,341 --> 02:17:51,170
And one's a full on personality disorder.

5296
02:17:51,440 --> 02:17:54,590
The fact that he's a psychopath and he's
probably skilled at covering out these,

5297
02:17:54,591 --> 02:17:55,130
it's like a path.

5298
02:17:55,130 --> 02:17:55,580
It's an,

5299
02:17:55,580 --> 02:17:57,530
I'm sorry that I don't
work on criminal minds.

5300
02:17:57,650 --> 02:17:58,071
She,

5301
02:17:58,071 --> 02:18:01,940
I can tell you from her nail length and
what kind of jeans she wears and how

5302
02:18:01,941 --> 02:18:02,930
about her fake Tan is,

5303
02:18:03,080 --> 02:18:05,510
I can tell you what a fucking nightmare
this woman is from the get go.

5304
02:18:05,870 --> 02:18:06,830
So I think one,

5305
02:18:06,831 --> 02:18:09,590
these are outward clues
versus like subversive clues.

5306
02:18:09,820 --> 02:18:10,430
Hmm.

5307
02:18:10,430 --> 02:18:11,263
What's that?

5308
02:18:11,480 --> 02:18:12,100
Kombucha.

5309
02:18:12,100 --> 02:18:12,650
Oh,

5310
02:18:12,650 --> 02:18:12,960
okay.

5311
02:18:12,960 --> 02:18:16,950
So I'm a woman who is into
nice clothes and nice nails.

5312
02:18:16,980 --> 02:18:17,813
I didn't say that.

5313
02:18:17,850 --> 02:18:18,090
No,

5314
02:18:18,090 --> 02:18:18,950
I didn't say he's into it.

5315
02:18:18,951 --> 02:18:20,680
And I can tell by the type the type,

5316
02:18:20,681 --> 02:18:22,770
but what is the type that
a guy should look out for?

5317
02:18:22,890 --> 02:18:23,790
If you're a,

5318
02:18:24,090 --> 02:18:28,650
you're going to give a seminar how guys
should avoid nightmare horrible women in

5319
02:18:28,651 --> 02:18:29,250
their life,

5320
02:18:29,250 --> 02:18:30,150
which should they avoid

5321
02:18:31,010 --> 02:18:31,490
you.

5322
02:18:31,490 --> 02:18:32,030
Okay.

5323
02:18:32,030 --> 02:18:32,720
Okay.

5324
02:18:32,720 --> 02:18:33,051
First of all,

5325
02:18:33,051 --> 02:18:33,920
it's a case by case basis.

5326
02:18:33,921 --> 02:18:35,180
There's plenty of
different horrible things.

5327
02:18:35,181 --> 02:18:36,014
Of course,

5328
02:18:36,350 --> 02:18:38,720
if she's got big old French tip nails,

5329
02:18:39,170 --> 02:18:40,400
she's a little bit of white trash.

5330
02:18:41,060 --> 02:18:41,391
Okay.

5331
02:18:41,391 --> 02:18:42,590
Friendship nails are bad.

5332
02:18:42,740 --> 02:18:44,720
Like long press on French tip nails would,

5333
02:18:44,721 --> 02:18:45,650
if they're real nails,

5334
02:18:45,740 --> 02:18:46,221
they're French.

5335
02:18:46,221 --> 02:18:47,210
French tip is,

5336
02:18:48,020 --> 02:18:49,460
to me it's just such a trashy book,

5337
02:18:49,490 --> 02:18:49,971
but that's fine.

5338
02:18:49,971 --> 02:18:50,804
Okay.

5339
02:18:51,590 --> 02:18:52,370
Um,

5340
02:18:52,370 --> 02:18:53,780
what about like dark red,

5341
02:18:53,810 --> 02:18:57,020
like Spanish girl with red
lipstick and dark red nails?

5342
02:18:57,110 --> 02:18:57,980
It depends on the girl.

5343
02:18:58,010 --> 02:19:01,210
It's a whole package because you could
have trashy elements like I'm wearing cut

5344
02:19:01,211 --> 02:19:03,050
off jeans right now in
a see through tank top.

5345
02:19:03,080 --> 02:19:03,980
That's what I'm talking about.

5346
02:19:04,380 --> 02:19:05,213
Ready to judge you.

5347
02:19:05,360 --> 02:19:07,980
But the rest of me is not Polish.

5348
02:19:07,981 --> 02:19:11,810
It's not like the rest I've got like
messy hair and one foot painted.

5349
02:19:11,870 --> 02:19:12,703
Is that okay?

5350
02:19:12,830 --> 02:19:14,510
It's okay because I'm like not trying.

5351
02:19:14,750 --> 02:19:15,583
Okay.

5352
02:19:15,680 --> 02:19:16,430
I think it's just,

5353
02:19:16,430 --> 02:19:19,940
there's just certain looks that
women have and I don't want to say,

5354
02:19:20,210 --> 02:19:20,361
oh,

5355
02:19:20,361 --> 02:19:21,111
it's this hairdo.

5356
02:19:21,111 --> 02:19:23,480
It's that there's a hole and
you know what I'm talking about.

5357
02:19:23,481 --> 02:19:25,970
It's a whole myriad of
elements that come together.

5358
02:19:26,600 --> 02:19:27,433
Does she?

5359
02:19:27,680 --> 02:19:28,160
And there's nothing

5360
02:19:28,160 --> 02:19:29,450
wrong with having like enhancements.

5361
02:19:29,451 --> 02:19:34,010
Does she have fake lips and fake tits
and hair extensions and clause Andy,

5362
02:19:34,011 --> 02:19:34,940
she weren't stripper heels.

5363
02:19:34,970 --> 02:19:36,650
Well then she's probably fucking horrible.

5364
02:19:37,570 --> 02:19:40,850
Like let's get serious
lucite heels like indoors.

5365
02:19:41,210 --> 02:19:42,530
That's pretty rare though isn't it?

5366
02:19:42,531 --> 02:19:44,900
I mean I'm pretty extreme examples.

5367
02:19:45,350 --> 02:19:47,210
I don't even know what realm
we're dealing with here.

5368
02:19:47,450 --> 02:19:48,310
Big Lip thing is,

5369
02:19:49,010 --> 02:19:50,720
that's a crazy one too.

5370
02:19:50,721 --> 02:19:53,540
Like they never really worked that
out in so many girls jumped on that

5371
02:19:53,580 --> 02:19:54,413
bandwagon.

5372
02:19:54,500 --> 02:19:55,310
Excuse me.

5373
02:19:55,310 --> 02:19:58,160
Jumped on that bandwagon and they
fucked up their face forever.

5374
02:19:58,190 --> 02:20:00,140
I think women in
Hollywood make a decision.

5375
02:20:00,141 --> 02:20:00,471
They're like,

5376
02:20:00,471 --> 02:20:03,380
I would rather look super
weird than look super old.

5377
02:20:03,590 --> 02:20:05,990
Cause when you like a lot of them
you can't tell what they are,

5378
02:20:05,991 --> 02:20:06,824
how old they are.

5379
02:20:07,280 --> 02:20:08,480
They're so weird.

5380
02:20:08,840 --> 02:20:13,070
There's this woman that I see at my
daughter's school and I drop my kid off in

5381
02:20:13,071 --> 02:20:14,270
the morning and she's,

5382
02:20:14,840 --> 02:20:16,760
it makes me sad because this lady,

5383
02:20:17,220 --> 02:20:17,690
she,

5384
02:20:17,690 --> 02:20:21,410
she looked like she was probably pretty
when she was younger and she's not that

5385
02:20:21,411 --> 02:20:21,770
old.

5386
02:20:21,770 --> 02:20:25,790
She's probably in her late thirties maybe
early forties but she has turned her

5387
02:20:25,791 --> 02:20:27,830
face into that a monster,

5388
02:20:27,890 --> 02:20:28,461
a monster,

5389
02:20:28,461 --> 02:20:29,390
and there's no going back.

5390
02:20:29,391 --> 02:20:30,140
It's rubber,

5391
02:20:30,140 --> 02:20:31,070
it doesn't move.

5392
02:20:31,100 --> 02:20:31,940
It's frozen.

5393
02:20:31,941 --> 02:20:35,990
It's filled in in weird ways where it
looks like she's got up fucking tooth ache

5394
02:20:35,991 --> 02:20:38,600
or something like her
face is swollen and she,

5395
02:20:38,601 --> 02:20:39,620
you know what the kicker is?

5396
02:20:40,310 --> 02:20:41,510
She might've gotten him for one thing,

5397
02:20:41,511 --> 02:20:44,600
had a weird reaction or whatever and like
now it's like that and she might be a

5398
02:20:44,601 --> 02:20:47,000
super cool lady or something
and that's just like,

5399
02:20:47,500 --> 02:20:48,620
like you're stuck with that.

5400
02:20:48,650 --> 02:20:49,640
Well you know what I think it is.

5401
02:20:49,641 --> 02:20:50,990
I think it's a dysmorphia.

5402
02:20:51,220 --> 02:20:55,310
Like the same thing where anorexics
habit bodybuilders have it.

5403
02:20:55,430 --> 02:20:58,910
Women who have a boob implants a lot of
times never think their boob implants

5404
02:20:58,911 --> 02:20:59,571
are big enough.

5405
02:20:59,571 --> 02:21:01,910
They want to keep going and going and
going and getting bigger and bigger.

5406
02:21:02,150 --> 02:21:02,630
They get,

5407
02:21:02,630 --> 02:21:03,560
they get crazy,

5408
02:21:03,710 --> 02:21:05,120
they look at them and
they're like not big enough.

5409
02:21:05,121 --> 02:21:07,760
Like they don't see what
everyone else is seeing.

5410
02:21:08,150 --> 02:21:10,070
Also when you don't have
big boobs from the get go,

5411
02:21:10,071 --> 02:21:12,290
you don't realize like
how annoying they can be.

5412
02:21:12,490 --> 02:21:13,070
Right.

5413
02:21:13,070 --> 02:21:13,903
I'm just saying,

5414
02:21:14,030 --> 02:21:15,440
well you have natural big boobs.

5415
02:21:15,890 --> 02:21:16,940
Did they fuck with your back?

5416
02:21:17,270 --> 02:21:17,721
No,

5417
02:21:17,721 --> 02:21:19,940
because they're not like
so big that it's like,

5418
02:21:20,210 --> 02:21:23,030
I mean those girls that have like back
issues like those are like gigantic,

5419
02:21:23,031 --> 02:21:24,230
like black lady bras.

5420
02:21:24,370 --> 02:21:24,610
Yeah.

5421
02:21:24,610 --> 02:21:28,670
I dated a girl who had natural ones
that were just enormous and she wound up

5422
02:21:28,671 --> 02:21:31,940
getting a reduction because
there there's doers just crazy.

5423
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:32,661
They were out of control.

5424
02:21:32,661 --> 02:21:33,321
They're like ease.

5425
02:21:33,321 --> 02:21:34,490
They were enormous.

5426
02:21:34,610 --> 02:21:35,440
There's this,

5427
02:21:35,440 --> 02:21:36,710
if we're going to get personal about it,

5428
02:21:36,720 --> 02:21:39,920
like especially like for like your
lady time sometimes like your boobs get

5429
02:21:39,921 --> 02:21:40,730
bigger.

5430
02:21:40,730 --> 02:21:41,420
I'm putting on a shirt.

5431
02:21:41,420 --> 02:21:41,900
I'm just like,

5432
02:21:41,900 --> 02:21:42,950
even I get annoyed.

5433
02:21:43,240 --> 02:21:43,640
Like I'm saying,

5434
02:21:43,640 --> 02:21:45,800
I need to put these things away and
like things just don't quite fit.

5435
02:21:45,801 --> 02:21:47,240
I try to put on a dress
yesterday and I was like,

5436
02:21:47,241 --> 02:21:50,660
this is inappropriate and you're just
trying to like make it fucking work.

5437
02:21:51,290 --> 02:21:52,123
But,

5438
02:21:52,220 --> 02:21:55,590
but there are also weapons
of math manipulatives drop.

5439
02:21:56,150 --> 02:21:58,190
You pull those out and do just go holy.

5440
02:21:58,191 --> 02:21:59,030
But Jesus,

5441
02:21:59,420 --> 02:22:01,330
we were ill.

5442
02:22:02,320 --> 02:22:06,120
I mean like motorboating I mean like the
look that they get like a cartoon look.

5443
02:22:06,690 --> 02:22:07,523
Whoa.

5444
02:22:07,960 --> 02:22:08,720
Yeah.

5445
02:22:08,720 --> 02:22:10,160
I don't notice it.

5446
02:22:10,190 --> 02:22:14,360
And I only say that because I think
when you grow up a certain way,

5447
02:22:14,361 --> 02:22:15,320
like if you're tall,

5448
02:22:15,380 --> 02:22:16,520
like you don't notice that you're like,

5449
02:22:16,521 --> 02:22:17,930
you don't think about
it and then you kind of,

5450
02:22:18,080 --> 02:22:19,360
you're used to be always
be like when we go,

5451
02:22:19,410 --> 02:22:20,130
you were tall.

5452
02:22:20,130 --> 02:22:20,931
If you have big boobs,

5453
02:22:20,931 --> 02:22:21,370
if you,

5454
02:22:21,370 --> 02:22:22,670
since I'm 14 years old,

5455
02:22:22,700 --> 02:22:23,511
it's always been a thing.

5456
02:22:23,511 --> 02:22:24,344
So I don't,

5457
02:22:24,530 --> 02:22:25,440
it doesn't make me uncomfortable.

5458
02:22:25,441 --> 02:22:26,130
I even think about

5459
02:22:26,130 --> 02:22:26,760
it.

5460
02:22:26,760 --> 02:22:28,530
I don't even notice people
looking and if they do,

5461
02:22:28,531 --> 02:22:29,370
it's very comfortable.

5462
02:22:29,540 --> 02:22:30,460
Well you do Sorta,

5463
02:22:30,461 --> 02:22:32,930
I mean that's why he said you make out
with the guy and take off your shirt and

5464
02:22:32,931 --> 02:22:33,890
that's a nice treat for him.

5465
02:22:34,300 --> 02:22:35,133
Oh yeah.

5466
02:22:35,400 --> 02:22:36,700
But that's what I'm saying.

5467
02:22:36,701 --> 02:22:37,331
Like in general,

5468
02:22:37,331 --> 02:22:37,811
like I don't,

5469
02:22:37,811 --> 02:22:40,110
I'm very comfortable around a bra.

5470
02:22:40,111 --> 02:22:40,944
I don't care.

5471
02:22:41,140 --> 02:22:43,030
It's not something that you
think about on a regular.

5472
02:22:43,570 --> 02:22:44,110
Right,

5473
02:22:44,110 --> 02:22:44,410
right.

5474
02:22:44,410 --> 02:22:45,243
I think about my boobs.

5475
02:22:45,760 --> 02:22:46,331
I bet you do.

5476
02:22:46,331 --> 02:22:47,500
I would if I had them like yours.

5477
02:22:47,560 --> 02:22:48,130
I touch him.

5478
02:22:48,130 --> 02:22:48,910
I'll tell you about them.

5479
02:22:48,910 --> 02:22:49,690
All girls do.

5480
02:22:49,690 --> 02:22:51,850
I'd be willing to whip them
out at the drop of a hat to,

5481
02:22:51,910 --> 02:22:52,510
nope,

5482
02:22:52,510 --> 02:22:53,343
not fallen for that one.

5483
02:22:55,550 --> 02:22:56,590
I'm totally,

5484
02:22:56,820 --> 02:22:57,653
what are words?

5485
02:22:59,110 --> 02:23:00,440
You have another show you,

5486
02:23:00,610 --> 02:23:01,540
you're going somewhere else.

5487
02:23:01,541 --> 02:23:02,351
I'm just looking behind me.

5488
02:23:02,351 --> 02:23:02,501
This,

5489
02:23:02,501 --> 02:23:04,150
I thought you were
making a lot more sense.

5490
02:23:04,180 --> 02:23:06,850
It's two 40 you have to bug you,

5491
02:23:06,851 --> 02:23:06,981
right?

5492
02:23:06,981 --> 02:23:07,690
I wasn't say one more thing.

5493
02:23:07,690 --> 02:23:08,200
Okay.

5494
02:23:08,200 --> 02:23:09,070
About that clip.

5495
02:23:09,240 --> 02:23:11,590
[inaudible] women need to learn.

5496
02:23:11,980 --> 02:23:15,160
It's very easy in an
argument for like I was,

5497
02:23:15,550 --> 02:23:16,810
I'm conditioned to,

5498
02:23:16,811 --> 02:23:18,100
when I watched that side,

5499
02:23:18,101 --> 02:23:21,280
even though that guy was horrible to
almost go against women like women when

5500
02:23:21,281 --> 02:23:23,890
they argue become very ugly women.

5501
02:23:23,890 --> 02:23:26,680
I think if they learn to be
more composed and calmer,

5502
02:23:26,830 --> 02:23:28,120
it was women who were
raising their voices.

5503
02:23:28,121 --> 02:23:29,350
They sounded like chickens.

5504
02:23:29,770 --> 02:23:30,311
They can't.

5505
02:23:30,311 --> 02:23:32,020
They block like blood chickens.

5506
02:23:32,021 --> 02:23:33,220
That guy was calm.

5507
02:23:33,221 --> 02:23:35,310
You notice blood chicken,

5508
02:23:35,720 --> 02:23:36,430
great.

5509
02:23:36,430 --> 02:23:38,050
That's a great name for a band.

5510
02:23:38,200 --> 02:23:39,260
Like the blood blood.

5511
02:23:39,270 --> 02:23:43,660
Chicken's good night ice house it up
for pussy riot next month in prison.

5512
02:23:45,060 --> 02:23:45,730
They're out.

5513
02:23:45,730 --> 02:23:45,821
Oh,

5514
02:23:45,821 --> 02:23:46,654
they did great.

5515
02:23:47,380 --> 02:23:47,861
That guy,

5516
02:23:47,861 --> 02:23:49,120
you notice he didn't raise his voice.

5517
02:23:49,630 --> 02:23:50,050
He was,

5518
02:23:50,050 --> 02:23:51,190
even though he was a Douche,

5519
02:23:51,191 --> 02:23:53,140
like everything was very calm
and the women were just like,

5520
02:23:53,170 --> 02:23:53,961
I'm proving that.

5521
02:23:53,961 --> 02:23:55,270
Then I'm strong and I'm this,

5522
02:23:55,570 --> 02:23:58,120
come on bloody hell.

5523
02:23:58,121 --> 02:23:58,481
What are you?

5524
02:23:58,481 --> 02:23:59,470
Oh Lord,

5525
02:23:59,471 --> 02:24:01,300
who are you dating and don't?

5526
02:24:01,301 --> 02:24:01,481
Yeah,

5527
02:24:01,481 --> 02:24:02,180
don't yell.

5528
02:24:02,180 --> 02:24:03,350
Well if just because you can,

5529
02:24:03,650 --> 02:24:04,130
if they,

5530
02:24:04,130 --> 02:24:06,680
if they kept it calm and
they talked like this,

5531
02:24:06,860 --> 02:24:09,620
I would have so much more
respect for women in debates.

5532
02:24:10,130 --> 02:24:11,030
Or You Watch Hillary Clinton,

5533
02:24:11,031 --> 02:24:12,890
she doesn't freak out and
get high fee like that.

5534
02:24:13,100 --> 02:24:14,180
And those women were awful.

5535
02:24:14,181 --> 02:24:17,660
And I think if women just chill the fuck
out and stop trying to prove to every

5536
02:24:17,661 --> 02:24:18,440
woman,

5537
02:24:18,440 --> 02:24:19,131
I'm so strong,

5538
02:24:19,131 --> 02:24:19,791
I'm independent,

5539
02:24:19,791 --> 02:24:20,750
I'm the all the real housewives.

5540
02:24:20,751 --> 02:24:21,650
That's all they do.

5541
02:24:21,800 --> 02:24:25,040
Stop trying to prove what you
aren't and just fucking take a deep

5542
02:24:25,290 --> 02:24:28,110
well that's one of those
things that also doesn't work.

5543
02:24:28,200 --> 02:24:29,400
Like saying I'm strong,

5544
02:24:29,401 --> 02:24:30,151
I'm independent.

5545
02:24:30,151 --> 02:24:31,260
No one believes that.

5546
02:24:31,261 --> 02:24:32,190
You can't just say it.

5547
02:24:32,330 --> 02:24:33,960
It's just like name dropping you,

5548
02:24:33,961 --> 02:24:36,570
you feel compelled to say because
you have a weak character.

5549
02:24:36,590 --> 02:24:36,780
Yeah.

5550
02:24:36,780 --> 02:24:39,090
But if you really are strong
and you really are independent,

5551
02:24:39,091 --> 02:24:40,650
you don't give a fuck with this person,

5552
02:24:40,651 --> 02:24:42,300
thinks about you so that
you don't have to say it.

5553
02:24:42,630 --> 02:24:43,081
You know it's,

5554
02:24:43,081 --> 02:24:46,680
it's one of those things that people
do because they're trying to paint a

5555
02:24:46,681 --> 02:24:49,500
picture of themselves that oftentimes
doesn't match up with reality.

5556
02:24:49,570 --> 02:24:50,500
That's my whole thing with,

5557
02:24:50,530 --> 02:24:50,801
I mean,

5558
02:24:50,801 --> 02:24:51,850
my own example is,

5559
02:24:52,090 --> 02:24:54,640
and I'm targeting real housewives
of that whole franchise,

5560
02:24:54,880 --> 02:24:55,840
is that should drive you crazy.

5561
02:24:56,000 --> 02:24:56,920
I can't watch it anymore.

5562
02:24:56,921 --> 02:24:57,820
I used to watch all of them.

5563
02:24:57,970 --> 02:24:59,560
I can't because here you have these women,

5564
02:24:59,561 --> 02:25:00,460
these middle aged women,

5565
02:25:00,760 --> 02:25:03,700
desperate to prove to each
other how fertile they are,

5566
02:25:03,820 --> 02:25:04,870
how young they are.

5567
02:25:04,871 --> 02:25:07,690
I could have a baby at
52 fucking can't you?

5568
02:25:07,930 --> 02:25:09,190
Cryogenic Monster.

5569
02:25:10,150 --> 02:25:11,290
Oh my skin care line.

5570
02:25:11,320 --> 02:25:11,621
Oh My,

5571
02:25:11,621 --> 02:25:11,860
this,

5572
02:25:11,860 --> 02:25:12,100
oh,

5573
02:25:12,100 --> 02:25:13,510
that's funded with your husband's money.

5574
02:25:13,780 --> 02:25:14,613
Here's what happened.

5575
02:25:14,740 --> 02:25:18,490
At 18 you got knocked up and thought you
would have a go at like being a model.

5576
02:25:18,491 --> 02:25:19,990
So you moved to Hollywood or something.

5577
02:25:20,110 --> 02:25:22,990
Ended up getting married to some guy who
probably fucking beat you and then at

5578
02:25:23,290 --> 02:25:24,130
when your kids were all raised,

5579
02:25:24,130 --> 02:25:25,570
you put your hand out of
the sand and you were like,

5580
02:25:25,571 --> 02:25:25,901
okay,

5581
02:25:25,901 --> 02:25:27,310
now I'm going to try to be a human.

5582
02:25:27,550 --> 02:25:28,960
That's what all those women are.

5583
02:25:29,350 --> 02:25:31,390
Why don't you start out
being a quality person?

5584
02:25:31,480 --> 02:25:32,350
Let life get in the way,

5585
02:25:32,351 --> 02:25:33,071
but deal with it.

5586
02:25:33,071 --> 02:25:36,010
Not like a garbage person
and I won't hate you so much.

5587
02:25:36,330 --> 02:25:37,240
I drew boobs.

5588
02:25:37,320 --> 02:25:38,370
Well said.

5589
02:25:38,560 --> 02:25:39,550
Eliza slessinger.

5590
02:25:39,551 --> 02:25:41,110
You drew boobs there on that paper?

5591
02:25:41,360 --> 02:25:42,193
Yeah.

5592
02:25:42,250 --> 02:25:43,083
Well said.

5593
02:25:43,330 --> 02:25:43,691
Listen,

5594
02:25:43,691 --> 02:25:44,320
Eliza,

5595
02:25:44,320 --> 02:25:45,400
we got to do this more often.

5596
02:25:45,550 --> 02:25:46,210
This was fun.

5597
02:25:46,210 --> 02:25:47,043
It was real fun.

5598
02:25:47,060 --> 02:25:47,530
It,

5599
02:25:47,530 --> 02:25:49,270
it lived up to the height between us.

5600
02:25:49,271 --> 02:25:50,540
Like we had some hype going on.

5601
02:25:50,541 --> 02:25:51,730
I tracked you down in the airport.

5602
02:25:52,260 --> 02:25:52,470
Well,

5603
02:25:52,470 --> 02:25:53,480
we ran into each other.

5604
02:25:53,530 --> 02:25:56,260
I didn't track it down and then I had
the worst flight ever and you didn't help

5605
02:25:56,261 --> 02:25:57,094
me at all.

5606
02:25:57,120 --> 02:25:59,430
We remember that guy like
wouldn't stop talking.

5607
02:25:59,440 --> 02:26:00,550
The guy was sitting next to me.

5608
02:26:00,610 --> 02:26:01,443
Oh yeah.

5609
02:26:01,450 --> 02:26:02,050
You don't remember.

5610
02:26:02,050 --> 02:26:03,040
I do remember now.

5611
02:26:03,041 --> 02:26:05,920
I remember and I didn't realize he was
drunk until like I need to pick up social

5612
02:26:05,921 --> 02:26:06,401
cues better,

5613
02:26:06,401 --> 02:26:09,730
but I didn't realize he was like wasted
until like 20 minutes in and he like

5614
02:26:09,731 --> 02:26:10,564
kept talking.

5615
02:26:10,670 --> 02:26:11,231
I was brutal.

5616
02:26:11,231 --> 02:26:12,430
And you got to fake being asleep.

5617
02:26:12,460 --> 02:26:15,550
I fake being asleep for the whole
flight to Miami Guy was one of those

5618
02:26:15,551 --> 02:26:16,780
California dorks.

5619
02:26:16,960 --> 02:26:19,600
There's a very specific
type of California dude.

5620
02:26:19,990 --> 02:26:20,830
They're just like,

5621
02:26:21,460 --> 02:26:22,240
he was an idiot.

5622
02:26:22,240 --> 02:26:22,961
It made me,

5623
02:26:22,961 --> 02:26:24,040
it helped me to create,

5624
02:26:24,041 --> 02:26:28,150
I just tweeted after this something like
if you played baseball in college are

5625
02:26:28,151 --> 02:26:29,050
probably horrible now.

5626
02:26:29,680 --> 02:26:32,200
Within five minutes he let me know
that he used to play baseball.

5627
02:26:32,650 --> 02:26:34,690
Well that guy would have let
you know anything about him.

5628
02:26:34,691 --> 02:26:35,524
He was a moron.

5629
02:26:35,560 --> 02:26:38,800
Every time I got up he would strike
up the most inane conversations.

5630
02:26:38,801 --> 02:26:39,490
Like I was scared.

5631
02:26:39,490 --> 02:26:42,300
I was in the window and he was
in the aisle on the other side.

5632
02:26:42,301 --> 02:26:42,610
Yeah.

5633
02:26:42,610 --> 02:26:43,210
So I would,

5634
02:26:43,210 --> 02:26:47,800
I would get up and as I was passing
my friend to get towards your io,

5635
02:26:47,950 --> 02:26:52,570
he would start yapping at me all
the way to the bathroom who had Yap.

5636
02:26:52,571 --> 02:26:53,321
All the way back.

5637
02:26:53,321 --> 02:26:57,130
He got up to meet me at the bathroom
and I got out of the bathroom.

5638
02:26:57,131 --> 02:26:58,940
He's waiting for me there and it was like

5639
02:26:59,110 --> 02:26:59,760
done in there,

5640
02:26:59,760 --> 02:27:00,151
man.

5641
02:27:00,151 --> 02:27:00,901
I'm going in now,

5642
02:27:00,901 --> 02:27:01,141
man.

5643
02:27:01,141 --> 02:27:01,231
Hey,

5644
02:27:01,231 --> 02:27:02,760
where are you going
after he'd gone to Miami?

5645
02:27:02,761 --> 02:27:03,630
What's going on in Miami,

5646
02:27:03,631 --> 02:27:03,930
man,

5647
02:27:03,930 --> 02:27:04,741
you partied it up?

5648
02:27:04,741 --> 02:27:05,221
Miami.

5649
02:27:05,221 --> 02:27:05,580
Baru.

5650
02:27:05,580 --> 02:27:06,690
I used to party in Miami.

5651
02:27:06,990 --> 02:27:07,630
No,

5652
02:27:07,630 --> 02:27:08,850
partied up in Orange County.

5653
02:27:12,030 --> 02:27:12,150
He

5654
02:27:12,150 --> 02:27:13,260
was horrible.

5655
02:27:13,350 --> 02:27:13,621
Yeah,

5656
02:27:13,621 --> 02:27:14,250
he's a dumb ass.

5657
02:27:14,250 --> 02:27:15,090
Definitely dead now,

5658
02:27:15,540 --> 02:27:16,410
but he's not.

5659
02:27:16,411 --> 02:27:19,200
He will live forever and he will
live forever in our imagination.

5660
02:27:19,800 --> 02:27:20,150
Eliza,

5661
02:27:20,150 --> 02:27:20,700
you the shit.

5662
02:27:20,700 --> 02:27:21,533
Thank you very much.

5663
02:27:22,020 --> 02:27:24,190
[inaudible] Shlesinger there's clothes.

5664
02:27:25,500 --> 02:27:26,030
There you go.

5665
02:27:26,030 --> 02:27:28,430
Sleshinger Eliza,

5666
02:27:28,440 --> 02:27:28,980
you're awesome.

5667
02:27:28,980 --> 02:27:29,251
Thanks,

5668
02:27:29,251 --> 02:27:29,490
Jeremy.

5669
02:27:29,490 --> 02:27:29,710
Thanks.

5670
02:27:29,710 --> 02:27:29,940
Ah,

5671
02:27:29,940 --> 02:27:31,890
how do people find you besides Twitter?

5672
02:27:32,340 --> 02:27:33,173
What's your website?

5673
02:27:33,450 --> 02:27:34,590
It's [inaudible] dot com

5674
02:27:36,180 --> 02:27:39,060
I'm going to be in Seattle
this weekend at the parlor.

5675
02:27:39,270 --> 02:27:39,511
Oh,

5676
02:27:39,511 --> 02:27:40,620
that's an awesome club.

5677
02:27:40,650 --> 02:27:41,700
