1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,910
Hey everybody,
what the fuck's going on?

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:07,670
This episode of the podcast is brought
to you by diff eyewear diff.

3
00:00:07,671 --> 00:00:12,671
I where they offer stylish,
handmade sunglasses constructed with

4
00:00:13,291 --> 00:00:15,990
high end materials.
They're as good or better than designer

5
00:00:15,991 --> 00:00:20,991
sunglasses without the $200 or $300
price tags instead diff sunglasses start

6
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:24,840
it,
just 50 bucks a pair and the best part

7
00:00:24,841 --> 00:00:28,230
is for every pair of sunglasses you buy
diff.

8
00:00:28,231 --> 00:00:31,890
That's dif.
Ef eyewear will give a pair of reading

9
00:00:31,891 --> 00:00:35,760
glasses to someone in need and these are
excellent glasses and I wear them.

10
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:39,930
One of the reasons they have those old
school cop aviator ones with the

11
00:00:39,931 --> 00:00:42,300
mirrors.
Those are fucking hard to get.

12
00:00:42,301 --> 00:00:45,660
It's hard to give good quality old
school mirrored sunglasses,

13
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:48,150
goddammit.
No people don't want to look like a

14
00:00:48,151 --> 00:00:49,560
creeper.
Not Me.

15
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,310
I relish it.
I like looking like a fucking creeper

16
00:00:53,311 --> 00:00:54,960
with the mirrored sunglasses.

17
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:57,870
Why it was wrong is everybody has to
know what you're looking at.

18
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:00,870
You know why his mirror bad.
You don't want to look at yourself.

19
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:05,010
I like them anyway.
Excellent sunglasses and you can get

20
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:07,350
pretty much any color,
any color you like,

21
00:01:07,351 --> 00:01:09,420
and still pay less than some designer
brands.

22
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:11,340
They're excellent.
I really enjoy him.

23
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,860
Very high quality.
I wear them all the time.

24
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,560
Have you see me go,
hey man,

25
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:18,120
is it.
If I were probably bitch,

26
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,870
what's with the questions anyway?
Do good by smarter.

We are also brought to you by Casper.

32
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:49,130
This podcast is supported by Casper,
an online retailer of premium mattresses

33
00:01:49,201 --> 00:01:53,910
for a fraction of the price and our very
own young Jamie has one of these

34
00:01:53,911 --> 00:01:54,480
mattresses.

35
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:57,630
They installed it in his house and he
fucking raves about it.

36
00:01:57,631 --> 00:02:00,420
He loves it.
He said is the best mattress that he's

37
00:02:00,421 --> 00:02:05,421
ever had and they are shockingly
ridiculously low priced in comparison to

38
00:02:06,301 --> 00:02:09,810
premium mattresses made by other brands.
Why is that?

39
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:14,990
Because they've done the wise thing.
What they've done is they have cut out

40
00:02:15,421 --> 00:02:19,050
the middleman and done what so many
companies are doing now.

41
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:24,150
They make really high quality stuff and
they sell it to you directly online.

42
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:29,300
These mattresses are made in America,
very high quality and they have a risk

43
00:02:29,341 --> 00:02:32,220
free trial and return policy.

49
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,990

if you go to a premium mattress store

50
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:58,080
and compare those,
I guarantee you you are not going to

51
00:02:58,081 --> 00:03:01,360
find the same quality for anything close

My guest today is my good friend,

83
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:04,350
my archery guru and my hunting buddy,
John motherfucking Dudley.

84
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:07,810
And we are in Iowa.
Ladies and gentlemen,

85
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:11,230
we're uh,
we're Dudley ended up and um,

86
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:14,380
and we're talking,
we did an impromptu podcast,

87
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:15,610
some,
uh,

88
00:05:15,611 --> 00:05:17,620
let you guys have it.
So here we go.

89
00:05:17,621 --> 00:05:19,420
Without any further ado,
ladies and gentlemen,

90
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:24,630
the Great John Dudley,
Joe Rogan experience

91
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:31,710
podcast
coming at.

92
00:05:32,021 --> 00:05:35,710
You live from Iowa,
a deep,

93
00:05:35,711 --> 00:05:38,320
deep,
deep in the Midwest.

94
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,273
That's where we are,
right?

95
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,980
I don't know where it came from.
Really drew me.

96
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:46,960
It was inspired by the lack of diversity
in this town.

97
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:50,290
A lot of white people out here,
folks,

98
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,470
white people and corn.
You know that,

99
00:05:52,471 --> 00:05:56,410
that term corn fed that was created in
Iowa.

100
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:58,130
Yeah,
for sure it was.

101
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:00,440
I'm having a great time out here,
John Dudley.

102
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,700
I've been out here with my pal,
John Dudley and uh,

103
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:08,770
getting some archery coaching and doing
a lot of bowhunting and we're um,

104
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,690
CNL dear man.
I was like,

105
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:17,750
made a deer and corn deer,
corn and beans and white people.

106
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:22,790
Yup.
It's awesome.

107
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:24,950
The deer out here.
Incredible.

108
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:27,470
I mean,
I've never seen so many white tail deer

109
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:30,320
in my life.
Definitely never seen.

110
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:34,460
We hunted for three days so far
unsuccessfully,

111
00:06:34,461 --> 00:06:38,690
but had a great time,
saw a lot of deer and today at least had

112
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,910
a couple pretty close opportunities.
Just,

113
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:43,550
you know,
if you don't know anything about

114
00:06:43,551 --> 00:06:44,290
bowhunting,
yeah.

115
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:47,270
You have to be a certain distance from
the animal.

116
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:49,230
Yeah.
I have to have a certain kind of shy.

117
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:51,770
It's not like a rifle for,
with a rifle,

118
00:06:51,771 --> 00:06:55,250
an animal could be 300 yards away.
All you need is a steady rest and a good

119
00:06:55,251 --> 00:06:58,040
rifle and that's,
that's a dead deer.

120
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:01,040
But with bow hunting,
no,

121
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:02,420
no.
You gotTa,

122
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:05,360
you really ideally want to be inside of
40 yards if you're,

123
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:07,220
you know,
if you can.

124
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:10,880
But what we're seeing is these big,
giant,

125
00:07:10,881 --> 00:07:15,881
mature wild 250 300 pound mammals that
are running around here.

126
00:07:18,681 --> 00:07:21,440
There are these,
you don't think of him that way,

127
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:23,570
but when you're around them,
like you're,

128
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,520
when you drive down the road,
oh look,

129
00:07:25,521 --> 00:07:28,370
there's a deer.
But when you're hunting them and you

130
00:07:28,371 --> 00:07:31,040
make eye contact with these things,
you kind of,

131
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:33,860
it changes the nature of what they are
to you.

132
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:35,930
Like,
let's talk about that.

133
00:07:35,931 --> 00:07:38,360
Uh,
the experience that we had was there the

134
00:07:38,361 --> 00:07:39,410
first day,
the second day,

135
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:44,030
the first day,
the first day we decided we had a couple

136
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:47,090
encounters.
Then we decided to come down off of the

137
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:52,091
stand and I decided we just,
we said 1:30 or 1:40.

138
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:54,740
We said we're going to stop.
Yeah.

139
00:07:54,741 --> 00:07:59,741
I personally said 1:30 and then at 1:25
you said let's fail.

140
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:04,970
So this is how that always goes at 1:25,
we had been in the stance at 6:30 in the

141
00:08:04,971 --> 00:08:09,740
morning and 1:25 I got down and as I'm
getting my stuff,

142
00:08:09,741 --> 00:08:11,390
we'd climb all the way down from this
tree.

143
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,570
John puts his thumb on either side of
his head,

144
00:08:14,571 --> 00:08:19,571
like bullwinkle to make the classic sign
of a deer antlers and this big ole

145
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:27,230
honking deer is coming down the way and
first a little deer came by and got

146
00:08:27,861 --> 00:08:32,861
within 15 feet of me.
I wasn't going to say 10 feet.

147
00:08:33,001 --> 00:08:35,540
It might be 10 feet of me.
I was standing by this tree.

148
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:38,780
Obviously I'm in all camel and I'm not
moving.

149
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:42,830
I'm just freezing.
And young deer and old deer.

150
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:45,430
They might as well be a different
species that.

151
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:46,580
Yeah,
I think they are.

152
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:50,630
They don't look the same hair,
they don't look the same and they

153
00:08:50,631 --> 00:08:54,760
definitely don't look at you the same.
So one young deer walked by me,

154
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:58,770
didn't notice me at all.
He was like within easily inside of 10

155
00:08:58,771 --> 00:09:01,290
feet.
And then the second deer walked by.

156
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:03,960
He was inside of like 25,
30 yards,

157
00:09:03,961 --> 00:09:08,070
walked right by me,
but then this mature deer came by and he

158
00:09:08,071 --> 00:09:11,640
was.
His color was different and he spotted

159
00:09:11,641 --> 00:09:16,641
me immediately and he looked at me with
this crazed intensity in his eyes and it

160
00:09:19,171 --> 00:09:21,960
was so interesting because right away I
go,

161
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:25,890
oh,
that's why people love to hunt these

162
00:09:25,891 --> 00:09:28,050
things.
Look how smart that thing is.

163
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:30,270
It's just looking at me.
I mean he.

164
00:09:30,271 --> 00:09:34,800
I was frozen solid.
I wasn't moving at all and I was looking

165
00:09:34,801 --> 00:09:38,190
at him and he was looking at me and his
eyes were wide,

166
00:09:38,191 --> 00:09:39,240
like dinner plates.

167
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,730
He knew exactly what I was and he was
like,

168
00:09:41,731 --> 00:09:45,030
fuck this,
and he just turned around and bolted,

169
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:48,870
but it was the electricity in the air
and the,

170
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:53,930
the intensity of his recognition of me.
It was so obvious and I remember

171
00:09:54,271 --> 00:09:56,190
thinking immediately,
wow,

172
00:09:56,370 --> 00:10:01,370
this is a really intelligent tuned in
animal that knows what a person is.

173
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:07,280
They know people equals hunting people
that are out danger,

174
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:10,770
danger.
They equal danger where the young ones

175
00:10:10,771 --> 00:10:13,710
don't have any idea.
I took some pictures and I posted a

176
00:10:13,711 --> 00:10:18,000
picture up on instagram.
We were sitting in the same stand the

177
00:10:18,001 --> 00:10:23,001
second day and this young deer came by
and literally took a nap underneath us.

178
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:25,080
Oh,
that's right.

179
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:28,440
I forgot about that.
Not only did he not know we were there,

180
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:32,750
like he didn't give a shit.
He just laid down is a year old buck.

181
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,530
His mom was out being a Ho.

182
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:38,610
She's out getting the gang bang because
it's there in the middle of the what

183
00:10:38,611 --> 00:10:40,860
they called the Rut.
And if you're a non,

184
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,270
uh,
wildlife,

185
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,920
uh,
enthusiast,

186
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:48,270
the Rut is one time a year and it's kind
of a crazy thing if you think about it

187
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:53,510
one time a year they have sex.
So the entire year everything's normal.

188
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:59,190
Everybody's buddy buddy.
And then all of a sudden,

189
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:02,370
one time out of the year for how long
does it last?

190
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:05,730
I would say three weeks.
Intensely.

191
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:07,530
Three weeks.
Three weeks.

192
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:11,160
They lose their fucking minds.
They lose weight.

193
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:14,820
They can't think straight.
Now they run out into traffic,

194
00:11:14,821 --> 00:11:19,821
they get hit by cars and they're,
they're literally just boner,

195
00:11:20,011 --> 00:11:21,200
crazy,
boner,

196
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:23,280
crazy.
They have no idea what's going on.

197
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:24,720
And they go,
they go,

198
00:11:24,721 --> 00:11:27,030
bananas.
I sent you a text,

199
00:11:27,031 --> 00:11:31,590
I said,
these poor suckers for 340 days a year.

200
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:37,250
You can't even find one,
but then all of a sudden they go full

201
00:11:37,711 --> 00:11:38,400
retard.

202
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:41,160
Yeah.
Imagine that was the case with people.

203
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:46,550
Imagine if you were like a normal person
and then one time out of the year you

204
00:11:47,971 --> 00:11:52,971
start growing a sword at the top of your
head and you just get next swells up as

205
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:58,450
big around as your waist mean.
For people that don't know,

206
00:11:58,451 --> 00:12:01,480
they lose those antlers.
A lot of people don't even know that,

207
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:06,810
that don't pay attention to deer,
but deer grow antlers fresh every year

208
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:10,720
and then once they're done having sex
and they're done with a Rut,

209
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:13,390
those antlers get weak and they just
fall off.

210
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:18,130
Which is what a bizarre metamorphosis.
As an animal.

211
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:22,060
Actually,
our horn grows is fascinating to me.

212
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:25,600
If if you.
If you shoot a deer that's still in

213
00:12:25,601 --> 00:12:30,220
velvet and then you're holding that
velvet and you have to in order to

214
00:12:30,221 --> 00:12:32,380
preserve lean velvet,
so velvets,

215
00:12:32,381 --> 00:12:36,430
like when it's fuzzy,
like velvet on the horn when it's in the

216
00:12:36,431 --> 00:12:39,280
growing phase before it actually
hardens.

217
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,590
It's,
it's fuzzy like,

218
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:46,100
you know,
just like velvet or fleece and um,

219
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:51,110
then what happens is that'll start to,
their hormones start to change and their

220
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:56,130
horns start to harden and then they rub
the velvet off so that it's just pure

221
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,990
hard bone and uh,

222
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:02,330
it's really interesting that it's like
a,

223
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:05,570
it's like fingernail type material,
right?

224
00:13:05,571 --> 00:13:06,030
It's,

225
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:06,930
I don't know,
man.

226
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:10,440
It was harder than my fingernails.
Maybe yours bro.

227
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:11,731
It will.
Yeah.

228
00:13:11,731 --> 00:13:12,360
Maybe.
Yeah.

229
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:16,070
Are Super Hard,
but is it made out of.

230
00:13:16,071 --> 00:13:18,530
Why don't you google it?
Can you google it or you have a computer

231
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:20,140
in front of you?
We'll give you it.

232
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:23,420
It is.
They're really fascinating animals.

233
00:13:23,421 --> 00:13:26,330
I mean,
I'm a wildlife enthusiast.

234
00:13:26,331 --> 00:13:30,080
I've always been really into wildlife.
I've always been fascinated by wolves

235
00:13:30,081 --> 00:13:34,070
and lions and predators and all kinds of
weird birds and stuff.

236
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:38,180
I just have always been drawn to like
nature shows and things along those

237
00:13:38,181 --> 00:13:41,930
lines,
but it's massively intensified since I

238
00:13:41,931 --> 00:13:44,300
started hunting.
Let's see what we have here.

239
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:47,360
This says the horns of a rhinoceros are
made of Keratin.

240
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:51,230
That's the same stuff.
His fingernails and grow continuously

241
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:55,310
will just google antlers instead of
horns because what are you?

242
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:56,300
You're a goddamn.
Yeah.

243
00:13:56,301 --> 00:13:58,460
What are antlers made of?
It was like the second.

244
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:02,560
You're a goddamn.
Listen Jamie,

245
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:06,020
you're a professional wonder.
How the hell do you call them?

246
00:14:06,021 --> 00:14:07,560
Horns,
antler,

247
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:09,100
son,
or the antlers?

248
00:14:09,101 --> 00:14:13,280
The deer antlers are made of true bone
that is fed by the covering of velvet.

249
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:14,180
Wow.
You were right.

250
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,510
Antlers,
innovative,

251
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:16,330
true,
well,

252
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:17,163
you're right.
All the time.

253
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:21,890
Antlers and made of true bone that is
fed by blood which is carried to the

254
00:14:21,891 --> 00:14:26,630
outer velvet covering.
Velvet Antlers are hot to the touch with

255
00:14:26,631 --> 00:14:31,631
brushy hair and a waxy feeling,
coating dear need both protein and

256
00:14:31,911 --> 00:14:35,210
minerals to grow their antlers,
and so what I'm saying,

257
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:38,600
letting them.
If you shoot a buck and velvet,

258
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:43,100
you have to.
You actually have to inject the velvet

259
00:14:43,101 --> 00:14:47,900
with involving fluid so that they don't
like to see in order to preserve them,

260
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,890
but it's amazing that you can.
You have to find the and the horn and

261
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:56,540
you push the embalming fluid through an.
Actually flushes in the blood,

262
00:14:56,541 --> 00:14:57,180
comes out

263
00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:00,540
base of the horn.
How do you find the vein it?

264
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:03,720
There's one,
there's one vein that runs the entire

265
00:15:03,721 --> 00:15:07,020
length of the main beam and there's one
that runs from each time.

266
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:11,220
It's really strange.
I shot a velvet buck in Colorado last

267
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:14,160
year and it's on my desk in my studio
and they said,

268
00:15:14,161 --> 00:15:16,620
how do you want to take care of it?
Like when I was getting it treated,

269
00:15:16,621 --> 00:15:18,690
because I get all my,
um,

270
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:22,080
the heads done what's called European
mount style.

271
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:26,250
The European mount style is like if you
see a mounted head on someone's wall

272
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:27,330
with the,
the,

273
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:30,480
the uh,
skin and the feather on it.

274
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:33,600
And then they have fake eyeballs and the
fake nose.

275
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:37,500
That's like traditionally what you see.
I find that offensive.

276
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,420
I know that's a,
it's a doll.

277
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:42,750
I'm looking at a doll pretending to be
the deer I shot.

278
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:46,500
There's a foam thing under there.
It's got fake guys.

279
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:50,430
I know it's fake,
but if you see the skull,

280
00:15:50,431 --> 00:15:53,190
like that's a real skull radish patch,
buck.

281
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:56,190
That buck is awesome.
That is a massive book.

282
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:59,670
Is that the one that you shot on your
show in Colorado or in Wyoming?

283
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,560
Montana,
Montana,

284
00:16:01,561 --> 00:16:03,800
because it wasn't lighted nocks right.
You couldn't use it.

285
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:06,330
Um,
so I told them,

286
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,520
they go,
what do you want to do with the velvet?

287
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:10,500
And I said,
does it scrape off?

288
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:12,390
They were like offended.
They're like,

289
00:16:12,391 --> 00:16:14,800
what do you want to scrape it off?
I was like,

290
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:16,710
there's this antler there,
right?

291
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:19,170
I go with two,
whatever you want to do this let me

292
00:16:19,171 --> 00:16:19,620
know.
And they,

293
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:20,510
they,
they do that

294
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,200
in Europe,
in Europe.

295
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,490
It,
like if I'm the Danish Shida bucket I've

296
00:16:26,491 --> 00:16:28,380
had,
I've been on a few hunts with Danish

297
00:16:28,381 --> 00:16:31,440
people and they'll shoot a buck and it
fits in full velvet.

298
00:16:31,441 --> 00:16:35,220
They strip it all off right away because
it's not like,

299
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:39,810
it's almost like that.
I think they feel like they shot an

300
00:16:39,811 --> 00:16:44,811
adolescent even though it's in a fully
matured because by the time season

301
00:16:44,821 --> 00:16:48,570
opens,
that velvet is on the verge of being

302
00:16:48,571 --> 00:16:51,690
rubbed off.
The Horn is fully matured,

303
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,700
but it just hasn't come off off.

304
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:56,140
So that's Denmark,
right?

305
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:59,120
They don't know any better.
Says it's like they're,

306
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:01,460
they're barely developed.
I don't know.

307
00:17:01,461 --> 00:17:04,100
They know.
And apparently that had just handed the

308
00:17:04,101 --> 00:17:07,520
caves,
the caves that are a couple of weeks

309
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,470
ago.
If you listening from Denmark.

310
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:13,580
We're kidding folks.
We've been up since 6:00 in the morning.

311
00:17:13,581 --> 00:17:14,490
Five,
five.

312
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,800
We got up.
Well,

313
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:18,950
he was hot.
Tubbing not with me.

314
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,300
Tell you that.
Oh,

315
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:22,030
hot tub would dudes.
I uh,

316
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:27,590
I got up at five.
But anyway,

317
00:17:27,591 --> 00:17:30,410
we're out the door at 5:30.
So we've been up for a long time.

318
00:17:30,411 --> 00:17:33,140
That's the point right now.
It is almost 10:00 PM.

319
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:37,820
And we got to do it again tomorrow.
Tomorrow's the last day of this

320
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:42,160
fantabulous hunt here in the great
midwest state of Iowa or Iowa.

321
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,730
What do you think?
IOL hunting.

322
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:45,140
Awesome.
Amazing.

323
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:47,160
What's the tradition here?
And it's,

324
00:17:47,161 --> 00:17:48,380
it's obvious,
you know,

325
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,950
when you,
to all the folks,

326
00:17:49,951 --> 00:17:50,070
the

327
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:51,240
locals,
uh,

328
00:17:51,241 --> 00:17:54,300
our friend Craig,
who is the local game warden,

329
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:56,820
you know,
gives us all the details on all walls

330
00:17:56,850 --> 00:18:01,850
that's going down your neighbor shot at
giant and oh my God,

331
00:18:02,641 --> 00:18:04,650
he just shot a monster.
He sister animals.

332
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:07,230
He's on the uppity up.
But no,

333
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:11,130
what I really appreciate about Iowa is
ever great program too.

334
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:16,131
And you haven't got to experience it yet
because we haven't got to go to the meat

335
00:18:16,711 --> 00:18:20,400
locker,
but Iowa has a program called the hush

336
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:22,620
and it's pretty much,
um,

337
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:26,760
hunter's feeding the hungry is really
what it is.

338
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:31,820
That's a great program to where people
are allowed to shoot,

339
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:36,960
um,
extra deer tags in order to.

340
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:40,900
And they can donate that to a hunters
for the hungry program.

341
00:18:40,901 --> 00:18:44,250
So they actually feed it,
goes to homeless shelters and things

342
00:18:44,251 --> 00:18:46,950
like that.
And it's a necessity.

343
00:18:46,951 --> 00:18:48,960
Like I told you,
my county here,

344
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:53,961
I believe the number of antlerless deer
that have to be taken is like 4,200

345
00:18:56,820 --> 00:19:01,460
extra tags.
And you will use,

346
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:04,680
you've seen how many,
how many times have we had to slow the

347
00:19:04,681 --> 00:19:08,580
truck down to not hit a deer.
And you've been here three days.

348
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:10,740
Quite a few.
Quite a few.

349
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:14,580
The sheer population numbers are pretty
incredible.

350
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:18,840
And one of the reasons for it is that
they've done a really good job of making

351
00:19:18,841 --> 00:19:23,370
sure there's not overhunting.
They also regulate the type of hunting

352
00:19:23,371 --> 00:19:26,640
you can do were mostly,
it's bowhunting in Iowa,

353
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:32,080
but you can shotgun hunt.
But you can only shot gun hunt for a few

354
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,360
days a year,
and by the way,

355
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:37,290
I'd rather have a boat and a shotgun.
You can make a longer shot with a bow.

356
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:40,710
Then he came with a shotgun and a more
efficient shot with a bow than you can

357
00:19:40,711 --> 00:19:41,544
with a shotgun.

358
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:47,330
I just feel like you get to enjoy more
of nature out either.

359
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:48,590
Yeah.
What,

360
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:49,573
what?

361
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:52,850
That's an inside joke because a lot of
people.

362
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:56,360
We'll have blown ears from guns folks.
Minor ringing right now.

363
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:58,760
Yeah.
It's cams ring all the time too.

364
00:19:58,820 --> 00:19:59,540
They did.
Yup.

365
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:02,120
Yup.
I know a lot of guys who have been

366
00:20:02,121 --> 00:20:05,720
hunters their whole life who have really
bad ear property now has ear problems.

367
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:08,140
Is he scam as deaf as I am?
Uh,

368
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,850
not quite as deaf as you are,
but he's got ringing problems.

369
00:20:10,851 --> 00:20:12,110
He's got issues.
Yeah.

370
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:14,450
It's again,
from shooting firearms when these young

371
00:20:14,451 --> 00:20:19,040
without ear protection.
I wear ear protection every time I fire

372
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:21,560
a gun every time.
It's smart.

373
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,513
Yeah.
Mine,

374
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:26,180
I was never told otherwise except this
last time I shot that elk.

375
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,280
I shut that awkward note your
production.

376
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,240
But uh,

377
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,580
where are they ringing then?
No,

378
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:33,900
just one shot.
You're too tough for to,

379
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:36,150
for your ears are ringing.
That's very kind of you,

380
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:36,984
but not true.

381
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:42,390
Does anybody have a tough,
tough go screaming my ears,

382
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:42,981
Bro?
No,

383
00:20:42,981 --> 00:20:45,440
I've seen.
I've seen some cauliflower ear.

384
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:48,760
See,
there's no just no sound penetrating

385
00:20:48,761 --> 00:20:50,020
those suckers.
Well,

386
00:20:50,021 --> 00:20:52,450
it's not good sound.
You know,

387
00:20:52,451 --> 00:20:54,780
people always asking why I don't have
cauliflower ears.

388
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:58,660
I wear your guards have always worn ear
guards for 20 years that we're in

389
00:20:58,661 --> 00:21:01,270
regards.
I have a little tiny bit of cauliflower

390
00:21:01,271 --> 00:21:02,920
ear,
like you could feel it here.

391
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:05,590
What cauliflower is,
if you don't know,

392
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:09,250
is um,
when your ears get bent over or broken,

393
00:21:09,251 --> 00:21:11,500
it doesn't have to happen from wrestling
and can happen.

394
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:13,810
Sometimes boxers get it,
you can get it.

395
00:21:13,811 --> 00:21:16,780
If somebody hits your ear,
if something hits your ear,

396
00:21:16,781 --> 00:21:21,160
what it is is basically just bleeding.
And when it swells up with blood,

397
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:24,820
when blood sits there and pools up when
it heals,

398
00:21:24,821 --> 00:21:28,960
it calcifies.
And so it literally becomes a rock like

399
00:21:28,961 --> 00:21:33,790
Randy coture used to drive his
cauliflower ear into his opponents

400
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:36,100
eyeballs because it's like a rock.

401
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,030
So He's,
he's taken guys down and like he's

402
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:43,990
clenching with him and he's shoving his
ear into their eye socket and using it

403
00:21:43,991 --> 00:21:48,220
as a weapon and drive them down.
But good luck getting some fucking ipod

404
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:50,020
earbuds into those things,
man,

405
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:51,670
you can't.
That's not happening.

406
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:54,520
You can't hear good either.
Like take your ears folks,

407
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:58,390
if you're listening at home,
take your ears and then take the top and

408
00:21:58,391 --> 00:22:01,690
do this.
Fold them down like that and then hear

409
00:22:01,691 --> 00:22:04,210
how different everything sounds.
And then let them go.

410
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:09,540
Your ears designed a very specific way.
And that way is to catch the sound

411
00:22:10,541 --> 00:22:12,130
waves.
The sound waves come in,

412
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:17,140
it resonates off of the shape of your
ear and it goes into the whole.

413
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:20,170
These guys,
and I know I know a ton of guys whose

414
00:22:20,171 --> 00:22:23,200
ears are so fucked up,
they can't get ear buds in.

415
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:27,670
They have to wear over.
The ear buds are super common.

416
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,050
Really,
really common.

417
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:31,030
It's probably why they always have the
big over that.

418
00:22:31,031 --> 00:22:33,320
Your beats by Dre?
Yeah.

419
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:35,770
Just so they can bonsers oh,
okay.

420
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:37,570
Sponsor stuff.
They sponsor the US.

421
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,100
Okay.
But yeah,

422
00:22:39,101 --> 00:22:42,060
but they,
it's hard for them to get ear buds and

423
00:22:42,061 --> 00:22:42,431
they,
they,

424
00:22:42,431 --> 00:22:43,270
they,
they're not going to.

425
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:47,490
They're not getting an ear bud.
And then how we got into earbuds started

426
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:50,140
with Iowa where,
how do we go with this?

427
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:52,570
Doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter,

428
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:54,760
but saw Caitlin Jenner's nipples.

429
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:01,880
Things $100
in this thing.

430
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,760
Right?
Or Alex.

431
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,680
I'm going to go with things you can't
unsee.

432
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:11,890
Yeah.
I'm all of a sudden they're big.

433
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:16,420
Caitlin has big boobs.
I want to,

434
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,660
I want to point out the political
correctness of all the people in your

435
00:23:19,661 --> 00:23:21,520
hunting camp because everybody referred
to her as a.

436
00:23:21,521 --> 00:23:23,140
she.
Yeah.

437
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:27,780
Really?
No.

438
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:29,140
We have,
uh,

439
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:32,200
one of my buddies came and one of his
buddies played.

440
00:23:32,201 --> 00:23:34,150
Call played golf.
Yeah.

441
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:39,870
Did a charity outing and then had a
picture and it was um,

442
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:45,010
they were surprised that there was such
a transformation.

443
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:46,280
There's a surprise

444
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,460
surprise.
It was a lot going on.

445
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:53,510
Well,
what do you think about this fight card?

446
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:56,960
Got a Fox fight tomorrow night.
We're going to come back and watch the

447
00:23:56,961 --> 00:24:00,770
fights after I kill a monster buck.
It's on the books.

448
00:24:00,771 --> 00:24:02,690
Folks in the car cards.
I'm making a prediction.

449
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:04,100
Uh,
it's big fight.

450
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:06,840
The main event is huge.
It's half failed.

451
00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:11,090
Dos Anjos who's the former UFC
lightweight champ versus Tony Ferguson

452
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:16,270
who is undoubtedly without question one
of the best lightweight in the world and

453
00:24:16,431 --> 00:24:19,880
the guy has been knocking on the door to
a title shot for awhile.

454
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:23,420
It's a really interesting fight because
it highlights a real issue with MMA

455
00:24:23,421 --> 00:24:24,770
right now.
Uh,

456
00:24:24,771 --> 00:24:27,110
and that issues weight cutting.
I failed to.

457
00:24:27,111 --> 00:24:30,050
Sandra's had a terrible weight cut for
the Eddie Alvarez fight.

458
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:33,440
I'm hearing a lot of conflicting
stories,

459
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:37,100
but all of them really bad now.
I shouldn't say conflicting,

460
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:41,990
I should say a different stories,
but of what went on when he was making

461
00:24:41,991 --> 00:24:43,850
wait for his fight with Eddie Alvarez.

462
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:47,420
And apparently he was in bad shape,
like really bad shape,

463
00:24:47,421 --> 00:24:52,421
like barely made wait for that.
And was just really in physical

464
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:58,220
discomfort and pain and just all screwed
up from that weight cut.

465
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:01,610
I think weight cutting is one of the
worst aspects of fighting.

466
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:04,690
I think it might be worse than the
beatings these guys take [inaudible].

467
00:25:04,691 --> 00:25:07,610
We don't see it visually and on see cuts
in their face.

468
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:12,020
We don't see knockouts,
we don't see blood when they're cutting

469
00:25:12,021 --> 00:25:13,790
weight.
So we don't think of it as the same kind

470
00:25:13,791 --> 00:25:17,720
of damage that we do from a beating.
But I think it might be as bad if not

471
00:25:17,721 --> 00:25:19,730
worse.
I would say worse.

472
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:23,710
It could very well be.
And then even more worse is the fact

473
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:27,950
these guys are dehydrating themselves
literally to death's door and then

474
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:32,780
fighting trained killers 24 hours later.
It's unavoidable.

475
00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:34,070
It's unnecessary.

476
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:35,330
I mean,
it's unavoidable.

477
00:25:35,331 --> 00:25:37,700
It's avoidable.
It's unnecessary.

478
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:39,420
And it's foolish.
I think it's a,

479
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:41,750
it's one of the most foolish aspects of
the,

480
00:25:41,751 --> 00:25:43,490
for the sport.
And you know,

481
00:25:43,491 --> 00:25:45,050
we were talking today,
uh,

482
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:47,720
with some of the guys at your camp
about,

483
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:51,350
um,
like issues with MMA and with the new

484
00:25:51,351 --> 00:25:56,351
owners are going to do a now that the
UFC has been purchased and I hope they

485
00:25:56,841 --> 00:26:00,200
institute a program to eliminate weight
cutting.

486
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:03,590
I think it is one of the biggest
problems and biggest,

487
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:07,580
it's a time bomb and it's just waiting
to go off and everybody's face and a guy

488
00:26:07,581 --> 00:26:10,430
like Hofeld dos Anjos,
who's one of the elite of the elite

489
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:13,340
before he lost to Eddie Alvarez,
a lot of people,

490
00:26:13,341 --> 00:26:15,530
including me,
were making the argument that he might

491
00:26:15,531 --> 00:26:19,010
be the best lightweight ever.
You look at a knocked out Benson

492
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:20,600
Henderson.
He beat the shit out of Nate Diaz.

493
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:23,240
He knocked out cowboy serone in one
round.

494
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:25,580
He's a fucking monster.
I mean,

495
00:26:25,581 --> 00:26:28,130
he's a killer.
He beat the shit out of Anthony Pettis

496
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:31,460
for five rounds to win the title.
Just roll them over.

497
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:35,300
Just beat him down.
I you can make the argument is one of

498
00:26:35,301 --> 00:26:37,220
the greatest.
Certainly one of the greatest light

499
00:26:37,221 --> 00:26:42,221
weights of all time might be the best in
terms of like champions and the

500
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:48,060
was so depleted from his weight cut that
he was like,

501
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:50,100
I had heard he was passing out
backstage.

502
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,320
You know,
I just,

503
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:54,180
I just.
If that guy died,

504
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,280
let's imagine.
I mean,

505
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:57,300
God forbid,
right?

506
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:01,860
But let's imagine if a guy like that
dies because of a weight cut and it has

507
00:27:01,861 --> 00:27:06,861
happened the last week,
the last death in mma was in Brazil and

508
00:27:07,261 --> 00:27:10,070
it was from a fighter who cut weight.
He died from wink cut.

509
00:27:10,071 --> 00:27:14,130
He didn't die from the fight itself.
I just think it's a terrible thing that

510
00:27:14,131 --> 00:27:18,000
can be eliminated.
And I think that if we did,

511
00:27:18,001 --> 00:27:20,510
you would see better fights.
That's what I'm saying.

512
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:22,340
Yeah.
I think how,

513
00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:25,280
I mean someone like that that's having
to cut that much.

514
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:28,100
Are they really?
Are you really seeing them at their

515
00:27:28,101 --> 00:27:29,060
best?
Absolutely.

516
00:27:29,061 --> 00:27:30,470
Are Not.
There's no question about it.

517
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:32,540
Yeah.
I think cowboy looks way better when

518
00:27:32,541 --> 00:27:32,750
he's.

519
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:34,910
When he's fighting heavier,
much better.

520
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,520
Look how good he looks at one seven.
I think that's it.

521
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:40,070
He was always.
He's always been an elite fighter even

522
00:27:40,071 --> 00:27:42,530
at 55.
But at one 70 he looks like a world

523
00:27:42,531 --> 00:27:43,790
champion.
Exactly.

524
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:46,550
Yeah.
I'm waiting to see a title contention

525
00:27:46,551 --> 00:27:49,220
right there that way.
I think it's an old thing

526
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:52,400
about Cyborg.
Yeah.

527
00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:55,580
Because you were telling me what she
walks around at one 75.

528
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,473
Yeah,
she's.

529
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,220
And I said,
well,

530
00:27:58,260 --> 00:27:59,570
as Jack does,
she is,

531
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,700
how does she,
how does she cut that much?

532
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:03,680
I mean,
that seems like an impossibility.

533
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:06,980
She does.
It is sheer strength of will.

534
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:09,080
George Lockhart,
who's her coach,

535
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:10,930
who's a,
a really good,

536
00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:15,770
really high level nutritionist and
weight cutting expert and he gets her

537
00:28:15,771 --> 00:28:17,960
down to that weight,
but it's not pretty,

538
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,670
you know,
there's a video of her struggling to

539
00:28:19,671 --> 00:28:24,671
make 1:40 the weight classes in the UFC
for women as of right now there's only

540
00:28:25,911 --> 00:28:26,600
two.

541
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:31,600
There is a 1:15 and then there's 1:35
and they've experimented with 1:25 that

542
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:35,720
talks about doing 1:25 pound weight
classes.

543
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,120
Um,
like a title at 1:25.

544
00:28:38,121 --> 00:28:41,420
But as of yet it doesn't exist.
Um,

545
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:45,470
but I think honestly Cyborg has said
that really her best way classes even

546
00:28:45,471 --> 00:28:48,410
45.
Well she's a champion of an invicta.

547
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:50,770
Her best way class would be 55.
Yeah.

548
00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:51,920
I would say.
Yeah.

549
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:55,550
And there's other girls out there,
man build it and they will come.

550
00:28:55,990 --> 00:28:59,770
I think 55 would be a really good
women's class because you'd almost,

551
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:05,610
you'd almost have that like Mark Hunt,
brock Lesnar's style.

552
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:10,650
You'd get some real powerhouses in there
that are still not too big where they're

553
00:29:11,621 --> 00:29:15,610
out of shape,
but they could just be like Cyborg.

554
00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:18,160
I think if you built it,
you'd have people coming from other

555
00:29:18,161 --> 00:29:20,890
countries that you probably don't even
know about.

556
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:21,910
I think.

557
00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:26,710
I think you certainly would after a few
years and that's just an investment that

558
00:29:26,711 --> 00:29:30,430
I think they have to make with women's
MMA right now.

559
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:35,500
Women's MMA is where men's mma was when
the UFC was first purchased because a

560
00:29:35,501 --> 00:29:38,680
lot of people don't realize,
but when the UFC bought,

561
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:44,170
when they purchased it from the old,
they eliminated 155 pound weight class

562
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:49,590
because they used to have a 1:55.
Then they had a one slash 70 and then

563
00:29:50,231 --> 00:29:53,650
they had,
I think they had a middleweight and a

564
00:29:53,651 --> 00:29:57,400
light heavyweight and heavyweight still,
but they didn't have anything lower than

565
00:29:57,401 --> 00:30:00,610
one 70,
so a lot of guys either left the UFC to

566
00:30:00,611 --> 00:30:04,630
fight in other organizations or they
moved up to one 70 and competed at one

567
00:30:04,631 --> 00:30:08,410
70 and some guys were like really
oversized or undersized for that weight

568
00:30:08,411 --> 00:30:09,730
class.
So

569
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:15,200
that's not enough.
Obviously it's really important that for

570
00:30:15,201 --> 00:30:18,670
a guy like mighty mouse,
like if there wasn't a 125 pound weight

571
00:30:18,671 --> 00:30:20,410
class,
which were mighty mouse competes,

572
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:25,120
we wouldn't be able to see the best
fighter of all time compete in is

573
00:30:25,121 --> 00:30:27,760
perfect weight class or 1:35.

574
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:30,310
You know,
you wouldn't be able to see Dominic Cruz

575
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:32,890
compete at his optimal weight class
1:45.

576
00:30:32,891 --> 00:30:36,820
You wouldn't be able to see Josie Aldo
gone that reign of terror for all those

577
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:38,200
years.
You wouldn't be able to see conor

578
00:30:38,201 --> 00:30:42,790
mcgregor fight at 1:45 and beat Aldo and
then 55,

579
00:30:42,791 --> 00:30:44,920
54 for the long time.
Fifty five,

580
00:30:44,921 --> 00:30:48,820
which is one of the most competitive and
talent rich divisions in the UFC didn't

581
00:30:48,821 --> 00:30:53,821
even exist and you know,
so I think that the UFC,

582
00:30:53,951 --> 00:30:56,590
if they really want to make that
commitment for women's MMA,

583
00:30:56,591 --> 00:30:59,890
they should have a full range of weight
classes for those girls to compete at.

584
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:03,580
I think they should start maybe even
lower than 1:15.

585
00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:05,890
I mean you could,
you could make a real strong argument

586
00:31:05,891 --> 00:31:08,650
for 100,
five pound woman's class a one to five,

587
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:10,150
1:15,
1:25,

588
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:14,500
and then I think really the trend of
those 10 pound per way class that should

589
00:31:14,501 --> 00:31:14,850
exist.

590
00:31:14,850 --> 00:31:19,450
The men's division as well.
There's two big gaps in the men's

591
00:31:19,451 --> 00:31:23,410
divisions are way too big.
There's one 70 and then there's 15

592
00:31:23,411 --> 00:31:24,550
counts higher.
One 85,

593
00:31:24,551 --> 00:31:27,490
that's a big jump.
And then there's 20 pounds above that.

594
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,110
80 five to two.
Oh five,

595
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:34,180
20 pounds.
Think about taking 2016 ounce t bone

596
00:31:34,611 --> 00:31:37,900
steaks and that's how much bigger that
guy is.

597
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:41,110
The guy before him.
Then you go to,

598
00:31:41,111 --> 00:31:41,561
oh,
five,

599
00:31:41,561 --> 00:31:42,970
two,
two 65.

600
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:48,360
So think about taking 60 t bone steak
six zero stacking up,

601
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:52,270
thinking about all the horsepower that
comes with all that weight.

602
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,060
It's just there's two.
The,

603
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:58,330
the gaps are too large.
It's too few week classes.

604
00:31:58,570 --> 00:32:03,570
So I think the UFC would be,
it would be very smart for them to make

605
00:32:05,201 --> 00:32:08,350
more weight classes,
do a weight class every 10 pounds and

606
00:32:08,351 --> 00:32:10,060
eliminate the weight cutting if they
could.

607
00:32:10,450 --> 00:32:12,840
And I think it can be done there.

608
00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:15,460
They're probably going to have to get
rid of some champions though.

609
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:18,300
Not Get rid of,
but they're going to have to read.

610
00:32:18,530 --> 00:32:20,470
You're gonna have to move pretty around
us around.

611
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:23,470
And the people who are champions,
yeah,

612
00:32:23,471 --> 00:32:24,940
they're not going to want to do that.
You know,

613
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:27,520
you're not going to be able to.
It's going to be a hard fight to tell a

614
00:32:27,521 --> 00:32:29,260
guy like dominick Cruz,
he can't cut weight,

615
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:31,850
you know,
when he's the world champion and say,

616
00:32:31,870 --> 00:32:33,090
look man,
what do you weigh?

617
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:36,160
One 55,
you're going to have to fight at 1:55.

618
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:39,950
Yeah.
It'd be interesting though to see how

619
00:32:39,951 --> 00:32:40,280
much

620
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:45,280
better fights we'd see if people were.
I mean,

621
00:32:45,681 --> 00:32:50,420
there's obviously going to be a position
where people are getting in good shape

622
00:32:50,421 --> 00:32:54,200
because there's a lot of fighters now
that the testing is happening to where

623
00:32:54,201 --> 00:32:58,480
that when they come out you can tell
they're not as noticeable.

624
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,220
Good shape is what they were at one
time.

625
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:02,720
They're not as Jack.
Yeah.

626
00:33:02,721 --> 00:33:07,640
They're not as muscular and it see,
it kind of seems like maybe we aren't

627
00:33:07,641 --> 00:33:08,690
getting the same

628
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:13,980
class of fighting at times with some
guys with some.

629
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,210
Yeah,
with some guys.

630
00:33:15,211 --> 00:33:17,700
But some guys,
I don't think that's the case because

631
00:33:17,701 --> 00:33:19,190
like mighty mouse,
I mean,

632
00:33:19,191 --> 00:33:21,240
you know,
he's still the elite of the elite.

633
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:22,950
You know,
you go down to 55,

634
00:33:23,130 --> 00:33:26,160
Eddie Alverez looks sensational.
Fifty five and you know,

635
00:33:26,161 --> 00:33:30,360
he has no issues with it.
He looks just as good a after the Usada

636
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:35,580
testing as he ever did.
Look at Tyron Woodley passes like flying

637
00:33:35,581 --> 00:33:40,581
color and if anybody looks like they're
some sort of a science project,

638
00:33:40,591 --> 00:33:43,320
it's Tyron Woodley.
So the best built guy in the UFC,

639
00:33:43,530 --> 00:33:46,110
clean as a whistle,
just awesome genetics and hard training,

640
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:49,260
you know?
And then you go up to a one 85 yellow

641
00:33:49,261 --> 00:33:53,100
Ramiro is the king of the freaks and
he's the freakiest freak that ever

642
00:33:53,101 --> 00:33:54,900
freaked.
I mean that guy is.

643
00:33:54,901 --> 00:33:57,000
If that guy's on steroids,
you just go,

644
00:33:57,001 --> 00:33:57,834
what A.
Well,

645
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,570
you know,
some people just have amazing genetics.

646
00:34:00,670 --> 00:34:01,840
Yeah.
Those people,

647
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:04,270
they're walking around at their weight.
They should be in.

648
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:07,770
Yeah.
I think that would help the whole sport.

649
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:10,650
If they could figure out how to do that,
if they could figure out how to

650
00:34:10,651 --> 00:34:13,920
eliminate the weight cutting and do it
smart and do it over,

651
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:17,070
you know,
a period of time and figure out a way to

652
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:20,070
establish new champions and new
divisions and,

653
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:25,020
and give guys financial incentives and
to do this and just let them know for

654
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:28,380
your own good for everybody's good.
There's nothing wrong with being lean.

655
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:30,770
If you want to lose body fat and you
know,

656
00:34:30,771 --> 00:34:33,390
and dropped down some weight in a
natural healthy way.

657
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:36,180
But this dehydration shit has got to
stop.

658
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:39,600
It's a time bomb.
It's a ticking time bomb and it's

659
00:34:39,601 --> 00:34:43,680
waiting to blow up in the face of the
most exciting sport in the world and I

660
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:47,160
just think it's totally avoidable.
And if you're a,

661
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:49,710
if you're training the way these guys
are training,

662
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:53,310
you're losing your excess fat anyway.

663
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:55,560
Well you're also,
well if you're eating right.

664
00:34:55,950 --> 00:34:57,540
Unfortunately some guys like,
look at,

665
00:34:57,541 --> 00:34:58,740
uh,
you know,

666
00:34:58,850 --> 00:35:01,590
look at uh,
a big country.

667
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:04,710
Roy Nelson trains like a madman,
but he's like,

668
00:35:04,711 --> 00:35:08,870
shit
unfortunately eats like a madman too,

669
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:11,310
you know,
and you can't say that it's just

670
00:35:11,311 --> 00:35:13,590
training because Roy's not out of shape.
I mean,

671
00:35:13,591 --> 00:35:16,260
that sounds crazy to say when you look
at him,

672
00:35:16,261 --> 00:35:18,960
but he's not out of shape.
I mean if you,

673
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:21,450
if you underestimated his cardio and you
go,

674
00:35:21,451 --> 00:35:23,100
man,
I'm gonna have to train for this guy.

675
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:27,150
That guy will beat your ass.
You know,

676
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:29,760
he's in real good shape,
but it just got,

677
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:31,890
he just carries too much excess body
fat.

678
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:33,530
It's,
well always,

679
00:35:33,570 --> 00:35:37,110
always talking about how cowboy likes
his candy.

680
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:38,040
Yeah.
But he

681
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,060
stopped.
He did.

682
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,380
Yeah.
He did say that.

683
00:35:40,381 --> 00:35:42,300
Well,
once you started getting into on it,

684
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:46,110
he started getting into honored
supplements and he started listening to

685
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:51,170
a real nutritionists and he just
completely altered his diet and for the

686
00:35:51,301 --> 00:35:55,170
first time in his life started
supplementing and you know,

687
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:59,180
take me to get that Kinda man.
I'm taking off these boots were this God

688
00:35:59,181 --> 00:36:02,700
damn boots all day.
We haven't done on what we have done.

689
00:36:02,701 --> 00:36:04,830
Almost nothing,
but yet I'm exhausted.

690
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:08,190
That's the irony of this,
this white tail hunting.

691
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:12,670
He's sitting in a tree stand all day.
We went for it.

692
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,150
It's totally a mental game.
It is,

693
00:36:15,570 --> 00:36:17,160
it is.
And you're going in.

694
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:22,260
It's mental and it's completely a for a
guy like me takes me completely out of

695
00:36:22,261 --> 00:36:23,100
my comfort zone.

696
00:36:24,830 --> 00:36:29,690
I actually took video of you
on the second morning.

697
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:33,580
We're about two hours in and I could
tell joe is just like,

698
00:36:34,370 --> 00:36:36,710
this is bullcrap because he's like,
wait,

699
00:36:36,711 --> 00:36:39,080
we're going to see her 13 hours.
Um,

700
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:41,540
he was,
you did a,

701
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:44,440
you did like,
you were doing twisties.

702
00:36:44,441 --> 00:36:47,060
You were like going side to side,
like twisting.

703
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:50,930
Then you were doing some squat thrusts.
You were like Kinda like doing like

704
00:36:50,931 --> 00:36:54,800
quarter squats.
Then you ate a peanut butter and jelly

705
00:36:54,801 --> 00:36:57,560
sandwich.
Then you like drink your coffee,

706
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:01,610
then you took a leak.
That was all in the first hour and a

707
00:37:01,611 --> 00:37:05,510
half just trying to get amped up bro
prepared,

708
00:37:05,511 --> 00:37:06,640
Bro.
I was like,

709
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:07,160
okay,
sure.

710
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:07,993
When it goes.

711
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,890
That's the other thing too.
It's like you.

712
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:12,570
There's all this time.
I mean,

713
00:37:12,571 --> 00:37:15,180
think about all the time he re practice
archery.

714
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:17,010
You know,
I practice archery.

715
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:20,910
I try to practice four days a week.
If I don't practice four days a week,

716
00:37:20,911 --> 00:37:23,430
I get upset with myself.
I'd like to practice every day,

717
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:28,290
but sometimes it doesn't work out,
but I can usually get in at least an

718
00:37:28,290 --> 00:37:29,910
hour,
so four days a week.

719
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:35,120
So that's all these weeks and weeks and
weeks of practice and some days,

720
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:39,240
I mean I don't have shit to do.
I'll practice three or four hours,

721
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:42,900
you know?
And so I'm just shooting an Arrow after

722
00:37:42,901 --> 00:37:47,730
Arrow after an hour waiting for one
moment.

723
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:54,110
We're an animal turns broadside.
It's like it's almost like it's not as

724
00:37:55,861 --> 00:38:00,060
crazy as a fight because there's no
physical consequences to me,

725
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:05,720
but it's more crazy in some ways because
literally depends on one execution of

726
00:38:07,861 --> 00:38:10,080
one move,
one execution,

727
00:38:10,081 --> 00:38:14,370
the release of a perfect Arrow and the
concentration and the focus has to be

728
00:38:14,371 --> 00:38:16,950
perfect and you have to launch that
Arrow,

729
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,980
whoosh,
right through the vitals of a wild

730
00:38:19,981 --> 00:38:24,210
animal that has no idea you're alive.
It doesn't even know you're there until

731
00:38:24,211 --> 00:38:28,830
then Arrow gets launched and that.
That to me is one of the most exciting

732
00:38:28,831 --> 00:38:31,860
things about archery.
One of the most exciting things about it

733
00:38:31,861 --> 00:38:36,220
is how much it really does get out of
your comfort zone.

734
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:41,250
How much it's so different than anything
else you do because like a fight,

735
00:38:42,210 --> 00:38:46,240
a fight is more dangerous for you.
There's more physical consequences is

736
00:38:46,241 --> 00:38:48,130
more nerve wracking.
It's scarier.

737
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:51,520
And,
but you got some time,

738
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:55,090
like they shut that gate and you know,
they say,

739
00:38:55,091 --> 00:38:56,050
are you ready?
You Ready?

740
00:38:56,051 --> 00:38:57,100
Let's get it on.
Come on.

741
00:38:57,590 --> 00:38:59,620
You know,
sometimes you get knocked out quick,

742
00:39:00,110 --> 00:39:00,820
you know,
and some.

743
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:03,220
That definitely happens,
but most of the time,

744
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:08,590
especially if you're good and you,
you fight intelligently,

745
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:13,690
you're moving around and you're avoiding
trouble in trying to solve the problem

746
00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:17,710
and you know it's up to your
conditioning and your training to

747
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:20,380
experience this thing and did try to get
through it.

748
00:39:20,381 --> 00:39:23,590
So if it all goes well,
you've gone through a three round or a

749
00:39:23,591 --> 00:39:26,500
five round fight.
So longest case scenario for a

750
00:39:26,501 --> 00:39:29,230
championship round our main event,
25 minutes.

751
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:33,520
So in 25 minutes you have enough time to
figure out how to get it done and solve

752
00:39:33,521 --> 00:39:36,340
the riddle and the puzzle that your
opponent presents.

753
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:41,260
In bowhunting.
You have one execution,

754
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,390
so months and months and months and
months.

755
00:39:43,391 --> 00:39:46,720
Say for a tag in Iowa,
super hard to get.

756
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:50,440
For most people you put in,
you might get one every five years.

757
00:39:50,441 --> 00:39:53,680
And what a tag for people to know
anything about hunting,

758
00:39:54,010 --> 00:39:58,120
the way they keep the populations
healthy is they regulate the amount of

759
00:39:58,121 --> 00:40:01,210
people that can hunt,
so they have a limited amount of people

760
00:40:01,211 --> 00:40:03,370
that are allowed to hunt.
In the great state of Iowa,

761
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:07,090
you got a tag every five years and when
you get that tag,

762
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:12,130
do you have as many days as you have off
of work that you can make it out here to

763
00:40:12,131 --> 00:40:14,560
get it done.
There's a tremendous amount of pressure

764
00:40:14,890 --> 00:40:16,810
and you have one deer tag.

765
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:21,810
It all boils down to one shot on one
wild animal for a lot of tension there.

766
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:23,600
A lot of shit going on.
It's like A.

767
00:40:23,830 --> 00:40:26,170
I mean that's like saying you're going
to be in a fight,

768
00:40:26,171 --> 00:40:28,810
but we're only a navy one punch.
Yeah.

769
00:40:28,870 --> 00:40:33,870
Each of you get gets one and we'll see
who wins sort of,

770
00:40:34,030 --> 00:40:39,030
but you're not going to get hit
and you're punching them with a of an

771
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:43,180
eastern full metal jacket,
you know,

772
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:46,600
Arrow going,
I don't know how many feet.

773
00:40:46,601 --> 00:40:49,910
Probably 290 feet a second.
Probably somewhere around there.

774
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:50,820
Yeah,
yeah,

775
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:51,880
yeah,
yeah.

776
00:40:51,890 --> 00:40:52,860
Right.
Yeah.

777
00:40:52,930 --> 00:40:57,400
You'd be equivalent to a 100 mile an
hour fastball I think.

778
00:40:57,540 --> 00:41:00,050
Yeah.
$100 a mile hour fastball with razor

779
00:41:00,051 --> 00:41:03,100
blades at the end of it.
I mean,

780
00:41:03,101 --> 00:41:06,310
that's really what it is,
but as they probably watched the world

781
00:41:06,311 --> 00:41:08,260
series,
if that's what they were,

782
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:13,690
but as a discipline,
it's um,

783
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:18,790
there's more to it than just the pursuit
of an animal or there's a bunch of shit

784
00:41:18,791 --> 00:41:21,970
going on and I know people get tired of
me talking about hunting sometimes and

785
00:41:21,971 --> 00:41:25,300
they know some people who are like
animal lovers or vegetarian or

786
00:41:25,301 --> 00:41:27,220
something,
get really angry that they be like these

787
00:41:27,221 --> 00:41:28,054
podcasts.

788
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:33,070
But I just try.
I'm just trying to relay what's going on

789
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:33,980
in my mind

790
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:37,310
and my thought process that this is like
a,

791
00:41:38,270 --> 00:41:42,140
it's like a meditation,
like a discipline and this incredibly

792
00:41:42,141 --> 00:41:45,860
difficult task through it.
You're,

793
00:41:45,861 --> 00:41:47,660
um,
you're trying to,

794
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:52,910
you're trying to like find the layers of
the onion.

795
00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:57,080
He try and dig deep,
dig deep into the heart of the thing to

796
00:41:57,081 --> 00:42:00,050
find out what it really is.
It reveals itself to you.

797
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:04,730
Even archery reveals itself to you
through the intense pressure of

798
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:09,440
bowhunting because there's like archery.
When there's a target and you're 20

799
00:42:09,441 --> 00:42:12,550
yards away from it and you draw back and
try to hit the x,

800
00:42:12,890 --> 00:42:16,550
you know there's a little bit of
pressure and then you move the site back

801
00:42:16,551 --> 00:42:19,130
to 40 yards.
Then there's a little bit more pressure

802
00:42:19,131 --> 00:42:21,800
and then you move it back to 80 yards.
Who?

803
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,510
That's a long way.
Okay,

804
00:42:23,511 --> 00:42:28,511
I got to concentrate.
Then after all these arrows,

805
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:33,760
then there's an animal and then there's
an animal and it's moving and it's

806
00:42:33,861 --> 00:42:38,861
walking and what you have to do is wait
to the moment where that thing stops and

807
00:42:39,141 --> 00:42:44,141
there's tremendous pressure and there's
tremendous responsibility and there's

808
00:42:44,510 --> 00:42:45,680
tremendous consequences.

809
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:49,010
The last thing you want to do is see
that arrow fly and hit that deer,

810
00:42:49,011 --> 00:42:52,730
that Dick and have that thing run off
screaming like no,

811
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,710
and you realize that not only does not
kill it,

812
00:42:54,711 --> 00:42:56,450
you named it,
it's probably going to live.

813
00:42:56,451 --> 00:42:59,520
It's going to be in pain for months and
you don't want that unknown.

814
00:42:59,521 --> 00:43:00,680
Sure.
You don't want that.

815
00:43:00,950 --> 00:43:05,950
So you have this massive requirement and
massive responsibility of you and

816
00:43:06,290 --> 00:43:09,980
through the intense pressure of this
discipline,

817
00:43:10,490 --> 00:43:13,610
archery reveals itself.
It reveals itself,

818
00:43:14,770 --> 00:43:16,610
it is a martial art,
you know,

819
00:43:16,611 --> 00:43:19,130
and I know people don't look at it as a
martial art because you're not throwing

820
00:43:19,131 --> 00:43:24,131
kicks and you're not choking people,
but our tree was developed initially for

821
00:43:24,351 --> 00:43:27,870
war and that's one of the fascinating
things about it is,

822
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:32,540
is developed as a weapon both to hunt
and to kill other people.

823
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:34,250
And that's really what it was intended.

824
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:35,630
Yeah,
it's definitely,

825
00:43:35,631 --> 00:43:38,870
uh,
one of the most advanced penetrating

826
00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:41,330
because armor came about,
right.

827
00:43:41,470 --> 00:43:45,650
And the,
and the Arrow as a projectile is

828
00:43:46,610 --> 00:43:49,970
extremely efficient at penetration.
Yes.

829
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:54,740
Because it's,
it's heavy mass with a very defined

830
00:43:55,010 --> 00:43:58,760
point that impact have impact.
And it,

831
00:43:58,850 --> 00:43:59,683
I mean,
it,

832
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:01,700
it,
I told you about some,

833
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:04,850
um,
a time where I did some work with Oakley

834
00:44:04,910 --> 00:44:09,910
on a ballistic helmet that they were
doing for one of our military teams and

835
00:44:09,951 --> 00:44:12,620
they brought me over because at the time
I was at the,

836
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:17,600
um,
the US archery training center in Chula

837
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:20,900
Vista.
So I went over to Oakley and they had me

838
00:44:20,901 --> 00:44:25,790
shooting these,
these masks that they had developed

839
00:44:25,791 --> 00:44:29,390
because they were saying they wanted to
know whether or not an Arrow could

840
00:44:29,391 --> 00:44:34,391
penetrate them and they were confident
that these things were gonna work

841
00:44:35,911 --> 00:44:40,260
because they said it stopped shotguns,
sops nine millimeters.

842
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:42,960
They were like dropping these like,
I don't know,

843
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:47,040
these like big steel staffs on him and
everything was working.

844
00:44:47,041 --> 00:44:51,780
But when I looked at it,
I said I'm going to punch right through

845
00:44:51,781 --> 00:44:54,300
that thing and they put them on,
um,

846
00:44:55,170 --> 00:45:00,170
on crash dummy heads.
And I shot them out in the parking lot

847
00:45:00,781 --> 00:45:05,781
at 100 yards.
And I mean every one of those things,

848
00:45:06,331 --> 00:45:08,730
we're dead meat.
There was Arrow hanging out.

849
00:45:08,731 --> 00:45:11,250
Both ends.
I've probably have pictures.

850
00:45:11,251 --> 00:45:13,740
I'm like,
what pound weight we pull in.

851
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:16,650
Um,
it was my target though.

852
00:45:16,651 --> 00:45:18,720
I was only pulling 60.
Wow.

853
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:19,980
And I told them,
I said,

854
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:23,790
there's so much energy being generated
to the front of this tip.

855
00:45:24,390 --> 00:45:28,050
I said,
even though this is made to block stuff

856
00:45:28,051 --> 00:45:31,140
that flattens [inaudible],
like a bullet will flatten.

857
00:45:31,141 --> 00:45:32,750
So,
um,

858
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:36,060
it disperses its energy out.
And you know,

859
00:45:36,061 --> 00:45:39,810
obviously you absorb a lot of that shock
if you get hit with a bullet and it

860
00:45:39,811 --> 00:45:42,780
flattens that energy gets,
you know,

861
00:45:42,810 --> 00:45:45,790
it gets connected into you bruise and.

862
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:46,633
Yeah,
and you,

863
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:48,630
I mean it's shell,
it's shock.

864
00:45:49,230 --> 00:45:52,940
Whereas with an Arrow it would just cut
through,

865
00:45:53,010 --> 00:45:55,020
you know,
unless it hits solid mass,

866
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:58,530
it would cut through and go out and you
wouldn't even know it.

867
00:45:58,531 --> 00:46:00,330
It's,
it's just like when you cut yourself

868
00:46:00,331 --> 00:46:02,220
with a knife and you're like,
oh crap,

869
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:04,620
you know,
and you kind of grab it,

870
00:46:04,770 --> 00:46:07,050
you know it's bad,
but you don't really want to look.

871
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:10,450
Whereas if you shot yourself in the
finger with a gun,

872
00:46:10,451 --> 00:46:12,870
I mean,
you know,

873
00:46:12,871 --> 00:46:14,710
your whole hand would have felt it,
right.

874
00:46:15,030 --> 00:46:18,060
It's not like it's going to just feel
like a paper cut.

875
00:46:18,390 --> 00:46:20,760
And that's really the difference.
Well,

876
00:46:20,761 --> 00:46:23,240
especially when you consider the fact
that you're shooting

877
00:46:23,370 --> 00:46:28,370
a light arrow through a target bow.
Like if you were using your hunting

878
00:46:28,450 --> 00:46:32,700
setup and a heavy Arrow with,
oh that's hilarious.

879
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:36,090
He's shot right through that thing

880
00:46:36,650 --> 00:46:38,290
through its eye,
off the back of the head.

881
00:46:38,291 --> 00:46:42,670
It's so funny that they pulled out.
I signed a couple.

882
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:45,200
I did some glasses to you,
but I did.

883
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:53,540
Yeah.
That's funny that they thought it would

884
00:46:53,541 --> 00:46:57,560
be fine.
See the penetration?

885
00:46:57,860 --> 00:46:59,180
Yeah,
that's not good.

886
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:02,360
They wouldn't let me show the helmets
because they were using.

887
00:47:02,390 --> 00:47:05,210
Wow.
That went a foot plus deep.

888
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:08,090
Kind of looks like elite it.
Click,

889
00:47:08,530 --> 00:47:10,670
click.
Guido and your favorite had to be

890
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:17,420
remembered his name.
Look at Dudley looking at young and

891
00:47:17,421 --> 00:47:22,421
dapper.
I was so that Beau is not as powerful as

892
00:47:24,801 --> 00:47:28,220
your main bowl.
You're hunting and the arrows aren't as

893
00:47:28,221 --> 00:47:32,080
heavy in the heavier get more.
And you're using a field tip too,

894
00:47:32,830 --> 00:47:33,970
right?
Yeah.

895
00:47:34,030 --> 00:47:36,490
Yeah.
So you don't even have like a cut a

896
00:47:36,490 --> 00:47:37,070
year?
No.

897
00:47:37,070 --> 00:47:39,490
I mean,
you think back in medieval times,

898
00:47:39,491 --> 00:47:41,350
man,
they were cutting through chain mail

899
00:47:41,380 --> 00:47:43,060
with arrows.
That's what I mean.

900
00:47:43,061 --> 00:47:45,520
That's why.
That's what they were designed.

901
00:47:45,580 --> 00:47:47,860
Have you ever seen those?
I wanted to ask you this before,

902
00:47:47,861 --> 00:47:50,590
and I always forget.
Have you ever used

903
00:47:50,650 --> 00:47:53,170
one of those mom goal?
Thumb rings.

904
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:57,790
The Mongols had a very peculiar way of
releasing their,

905
00:47:57,791 --> 00:47:58,900
uh,
archery.

906
00:47:58,940 --> 00:47:59,830
Um,
their,

907
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:02,500
their arrows.
The way they would use the release on

908
00:48:02,501 --> 00:48:04,180
the boat,
they had a ring,

909
00:48:04,390 --> 00:48:09,390
like a fat piece of bone that would fit
around their thumb and they would hook

910
00:48:09,731 --> 00:48:13,090
with the thumb on the string and this
was how they would hold it.

911
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:17,760
They would hold it like this,
like almost like you're shooting pool so

912
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:20,830
they reach over seeing them do it,
but I didn't know they had a ring.

913
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:25,030
So most people they think of like Robin
Hood style of pulling back a Rico

914
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:30,120
recurve where you would grab it with
your fingers and pull it back with your

915
00:48:30,251 --> 00:48:33,250
fingers.
But would they would do is that thumb

916
00:48:33,251 --> 00:48:37,930
ring comes out and they wrapped that
around and if you go back to that

917
00:48:37,931 --> 00:48:40,540
picture that you had early,
you can see that picture right there.

918
00:48:40,750 --> 00:48:42,980
See that is where the,
the,

919
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:47,890
the cord,
the drawstring hits on that and the

920
00:48:47,891 --> 00:48:51,490
thumb goes through that loop and then
they wrap their finger around it.

921
00:48:51,491 --> 00:48:56,080
So that is what holds on.
That seems to me to be a way better way

922
00:48:56,380 --> 00:48:59,890
than holding it with your fingers like
this and just let him go with your

923
00:48:59,891 --> 00:49:01,930
fingers.
It seems like it would be more

924
00:49:01,931 --> 00:49:04,750
repeatable and also that hard surface.

925
00:49:04,820 --> 00:49:05,653
Yeah.
Well,

926
00:49:06,010 --> 00:49:10,610
fingers you have more repeatable.
It'll be a boon he's using.

927
00:49:10,611 --> 00:49:14,390
It looks like he's using a metal.
Some people don't like to mess around

928
00:49:14,391 --> 00:49:18,020
with.
Could be titanium.

929
00:49:18,890 --> 00:49:22,100
Yeah.
Could've melted down as his first loves

930
00:49:22,101 --> 00:49:25,190
necklace and just went crazy.
I could have taken a cock ring and just

931
00:49:25,191 --> 00:49:29,000
stretched out part of it.
I think that is for sure as a conquering

932
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:30,133
it is,

933
00:49:30,220 --> 00:49:32,350
but they used to the Mongols use use
bone.

934
00:49:32,351 --> 00:49:33,790
There's like a whole series of them.
Right.

935
00:49:33,860 --> 00:49:38,860
They're pretty bad ass.
I haven't seen any other people that

936
00:49:39,371 --> 00:49:42,040
have done this before and this is
something that I,

937
00:49:42,130 --> 00:49:44,620
uh,
I got into after I listened to the

938
00:49:44,621 --> 00:49:46,570
hardcore history series on the mon
goals,

939
00:49:46,810 --> 00:49:50,050
I really got super fascinated about them
and their archery methods.

940
00:49:50,470 --> 00:49:52,480
They,
according to Dan Carlin at least,

941
00:49:52,481 --> 00:49:56,740
and he's done pretty extensive research.
Their bows were 160 pounds

942
00:49:56,760 --> 00:50:00,990
pole recurves yeah.
They were tremendous.

943
00:50:01,620 --> 00:50:04,230
But they would have to be because they
weren't near as efficient.

944
00:50:04,231 --> 00:50:06,930
Then would have to be in order to
generate the.

945
00:50:07,940 --> 00:50:10,310
I believe they invented the recurve.
Actually.

946
00:50:11,150 --> 00:50:16,150
I'm pretty sure the Mongols did.
I'm pretty sure they were at least the

947
00:50:16,971 --> 00:50:19,100
first adopters.
They might've vented it.

948
00:50:19,430 --> 00:50:19,880
Well,
let's,

949
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:22,640
let's Google that shit.
Who invented the recurve bow?

950
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:23,680
What do you think?
Tayga?

951
00:50:23,690 --> 00:50:24,810
Yes.
Um,

952
00:50:25,250 --> 00:50:28,040
you're an archery fanatic.
Who invented recurve bow?

953
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:32,540
I would have to say it's either going to
be them or I think it's the Mongols.

954
00:50:33,470 --> 00:50:36,790
I might've made that up though.
Let's see.

955
00:50:37,970 --> 00:50:42,970
And survey says who invented the recurve
bow recurve.

956
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:46,470
I was going to say the Greeks.
See

957
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:50,360
that was the Greeks second millennium,
BC.

958
00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:52,700
Wow.
The recurve bow spread to Egypt,

959
00:50:53,060 --> 00:50:55,880
much of Asia and the second millennium
BC.

960
00:50:55,940 --> 00:50:57,710
Okay.
So I'm definitely wrong because the

961
00:50:57,711 --> 00:51:01,700
Mongols were when during the gang it's
con days at least.

962
00:51:01,970 --> 00:51:04,130
That was $1,200.
Um,

963
00:51:04,131 --> 00:51:07,310
so go to that Mongol bone with
wikipedia.

964
00:51:07,311 --> 00:51:10,580
It's a type of recurve,
composite bow.

965
00:51:11,230 --> 00:51:14,480
Think of that.
They had a specific type of bowl,

966
00:51:14,820 --> 00:51:18,910
a recurve composite bow.
It can be two types of both.

967
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:22,580
In the 17th century onward,
most are traditional bows and Mongolia

968
00:51:22,581 --> 00:51:24,980
were replaced with a symbol or Manchu
blow,

969
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:29,090
which is primarily a distinguished by
larger.

970
00:51:29,390 --> 00:51:33,590
What's that word?
See us s I y a prison stage,

971
00:51:33,620 --> 00:51:38,620
prominent string bridges.
The old Mongolian bows were used during

972
00:51:38,931 --> 00:51:43,910
the rule of gingiss con were smaller
than the modern Manchu derived weapons

973
00:51:43,911 --> 00:51:48,911
used by most Nadam an a d,
a m paintings as well as at least one

974
00:51:50,061 --> 00:51:53,150
surviving example of a 13th century
Mongo boat.

975
00:51:53,180 --> 00:51:54,410
Dude,
I want that.

976
00:51:54,860 --> 00:51:57,860
Imagine having a 13th century Mongol
blow.

977
00:51:58,490 --> 00:52:02,570
That would be the shoot.
I know I've shot one before.

978
00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:03,860
How you really?
Yeah.

979
00:52:03,861 --> 00:52:05,990
I wanted to always shoot one off
horseback,

980
00:52:05,991 --> 00:52:09,050
but I want to do it.
I did.

981
00:52:09,051 --> 00:52:11,840
Um,
I'll try to find a.

982
00:52:12,980 --> 00:52:17,980
trying to find a picture here for you.
But I was presented one as a gift.

983
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:21,020
I don't know where I've got it.
I've got one here.

984
00:52:21,021 --> 00:52:24,650
I've got a Mongo bull that I was given
as a gift and I.

985
00:52:24,950 --> 00:52:27,020
and they said,
well traditionally these were always

986
00:52:27,021 --> 00:52:29,240
shot off horseback.
That's why they're short.

987
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:30,440
Oh,
that makes sense.

988
00:52:30,470 --> 00:52:32,570
That's why they're short so that you can
do it.

989
00:52:32,571 --> 00:52:34,160
So I ended up,
um,

990
00:52:35,090 --> 00:52:39,560
I was on one of my coaching tours
through Europe,

991
00:52:39,590 --> 00:52:44,540
so the guy that was actually escort me,
his name was Andre.

992
00:52:45,410 --> 00:52:48,640
I actually got on his back and I mean,

993
00:52:53,260 --> 00:52:55,480
that's ridiculous.
You're a big guy.

994
00:52:55,570 --> 00:52:56,210
Yeah.

995
00:52:56,210 --> 00:52:58,010
And he's about 65.

996
00:52:58,610 --> 00:52:59,950
No.
Yeah,

997
00:52:59,990 --> 00:53:03,590
you were riding a 65 pound man.
Riding them like seabiscuit

998
00:53:06,980 --> 00:53:09,580
picture that I'm going to buy it.
I need to see a picture.

999
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:11,870
You riding an old man,
you might have killed them.

1000
00:53:11,930 --> 00:53:13,850
That's not fair.
What do you wait?

1001
00:53:13,851 --> 00:53:15,380
You gotta wait.
At least 242,

1002
00:53:15,381 --> 00:53:15,430
three

1003
00:53:15,430 --> 00:53:16,720
pounds.
I'm up there.

1004
00:53:17,350 --> 00:53:18,670
I'm up there.
How tall are you?

1005
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:21,700
Um,
2:30 right now.

1006
00:53:21,850 --> 00:53:23,200
Tall,
tall.

1007
00:53:23,201 --> 00:53:24,460
Six five.
Yeah.

1008
00:53:24,461 --> 00:53:26,010
You're a big to be riding

1009
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:29,580
a 65 year old man.
I don't think any 65 year old men should

1010
00:53:29,581 --> 00:53:32,460
be carrying around six foot five dudes.
That's just me though.

1011
00:53:32,730 --> 00:53:37,730
I know he was taking one for the team.
The one that my break is back.

1012
00:53:39,270 --> 00:53:41,340
I know.
I don't want to take that one.

1013
00:53:41,730 --> 00:53:43,830
I've got,
I forgot the picture somewhere,

1014
00:53:43,831 --> 00:53:45,990
but I'll have to post it later.
Um,

1015
00:53:46,310 --> 00:53:49,440
so the Mongols,
according to Dan Carlin,

1016
00:53:49,470 --> 00:53:54,150
they had developed timing where they
would release the bow as the horse was

1017
00:53:54,151 --> 00:53:57,810
in the air so that it didn't disturb
them with the bouncing.

1018
00:53:58,020 --> 00:54:00,770
So that totally makes sense.
So as the,

1019
00:54:01,060 --> 00:54:04,680
the horse was in the air,
that's when they would release.

1020
00:54:04,710 --> 00:54:05,700
That would.
Yeah.

1021
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:08,140
I think I would have figured that part
out to

1022
00:54:11,230 --> 00:54:12,630
come a long way,
man,

1023
00:54:13,230 --> 00:54:15,330
because of you my friend because of you.

1024
00:54:15,410 --> 00:54:17,150
Well,
I wasn't saying it for that reason,

1025
00:54:17,151 --> 00:54:19,430
but that is,
was thoroughly impressed.

1026
00:54:19,431 --> 00:54:23,510
You're a,
you're a perfect protege because you

1027
00:54:23,540 --> 00:54:25,460
applied.
Everything taught.

1028
00:54:26,350 --> 00:54:31,350
When I think so cool about archery is
that people of any age can do it any

1029
00:54:33,381 --> 00:54:36,200
age,
any type of stature.

1030
00:54:37,100 --> 00:54:39,200
We're going through.
I got to show you some of these

1031
00:54:39,201 --> 00:54:42,350
pictures.
I wish you riding a man.

1032
00:54:42,830 --> 00:54:45,050
Well,
there will be a picture of me just

1033
00:54:45,290 --> 00:54:46,890
coaching pictures.
Yeah.

1034
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:48,410
Yeah.
If there's thousands,

1035
00:54:48,411 --> 00:54:51,860
but now that I'm going through,
I'm like remembering some of these

1036
00:54:51,861 --> 00:54:53,360
people that I had to work with.

1037
00:54:55,420 --> 00:54:57,440
People don't even know why to laugh at
that,

1038
00:54:57,750 --> 00:55:00,680
but the things about archery,
um,

1039
00:55:00,770 --> 00:55:04,010
you know,
obviously bowhunting I think is one of

1040
00:55:04,011 --> 00:55:09,011
the most extreme expressions of it,
but I had no idea before I started

1041
00:55:10,371 --> 00:55:13,130
practicing it,
how deep the rabbit hole goes.

1042
00:55:13,370 --> 00:55:15,680
And I think that's the case with a lot
of things.

1043
00:55:15,681 --> 00:55:18,740
I think that's probably the case with
most disciplines,

1044
00:55:18,980 --> 00:55:21,260
most things that people do that are
really difficult.

1045
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:25,270
I think that certainly probably the case
with golf and some other things that

1046
00:55:25,271 --> 00:55:28,520
I've never tried.
But with archery I just,

1047
00:55:28,550 --> 00:55:31,940
I can't believe how much effort is
involved in it.

1048
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:35,090
And I saw,
I posted something about it on instagram

1049
00:55:35,091 --> 00:55:39,920
once about how rewarding it is to and
how difficult it is and how humbling it

1050
00:55:39,921 --> 00:55:41,490
is.
And You keep practicing.

1051
00:55:41,491 --> 00:55:43,120
And,
and uh,

1052
00:55:43,130 --> 00:55:45,290
this is you on this man.
That's hilarious.

1053
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:50,150
This is our form.
It looks excellent considering that

1054
00:55:50,151 --> 00:55:51,260
you're crippling.
Someone

1055
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:57,830
will have to post that on instagram.
Save that and post that.

1056
00:55:57,831 --> 00:56:01,310
Tonight we'll have a link to.
Oh,

1057
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:02,810
that's another thing I wanted to ask you
about.

1058
00:56:03,020 --> 00:56:08,020
I'm sure you've seen this guy.
His name is lars and a senior and he's

1059
00:56:08,061 --> 00:56:13,061
got this method where he holds arrows in
between his fingers of the hand.

1060
00:56:13,281 --> 00:56:16,520
He's drawing the bow backward.
John's shaking his head right now.

1061
00:56:16,521 --> 00:56:20,410
I haven't got a call bullcrap on that
really well.

1062
00:56:20,411 --> 00:56:23,150
How are you calling bullcrap pr?
I think part of it was

1063
00:56:24,340 --> 00:56:28,630
somewhat believable and why they held
the arrows the way they did so they

1064
00:56:28,631 --> 00:56:30,400
could load and sheet fast.
Yeah,

1065
00:56:30,940 --> 00:56:35,940
but and I mean there's no doubt if you
would want him on your team because he

1066
00:56:38,891 --> 00:56:43,891
is obviously perfected that technique,
but it's not like historically there's

1067
00:56:46,300 --> 00:56:50,770
facts and stories around of people that
had that type of skill.

1068
00:56:50,830 --> 00:56:55,600
We know there are ancient photos or
ancient drawings rather have them during

1069
00:56:55,630 --> 00:56:57,050
the arrows that way.
I would,

1070
00:56:57,160 --> 00:56:59,650
yeah.
I would definitely say they carry it

1071
00:56:59,651 --> 00:57:04,651
that way because you could load it,
but his method of like shooting in this

1072
00:57:05,350 --> 00:57:08,530
trick style of shooting.
I don't know if people want to become

1073
00:57:08,531 --> 00:57:10,150
that proficient with it.

1074
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:12,480
I do.
I think they would be.

1075
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:14,340
I mean,
if that's what you did,

1076
00:57:14,610 --> 00:57:17,490
I mean,
think about the Mongols and the fact

1077
00:57:17,491 --> 00:57:22,491
that they use that weapon so efficiently
to dominate massive chunks of the world.

1078
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:26,610
And this is a conversation we were
having earlier today.

1079
00:57:26,700 --> 00:57:28,590
Yeah,
that was fascinating about,

1080
00:57:28,591 --> 00:57:29,390
uh,
the,

1081
00:57:29,390 --> 00:57:33,330
the New York Times article that said
that during gingiss cons day,

1082
00:57:33,630 --> 00:57:38,400
they killed so many people.
It changed the carbon footprint of the

1083
00:57:38,401 --> 00:57:42,390
world.
They killed 10 percent of the human

1084
00:57:42,391 --> 00:57:47,391
population on earth.
Ten percent were directly connected to

1085
00:57:48,811 --> 00:57:51,420
the Mongols.
The Mongols had killed 10 percent of the

1086
00:57:51,421 --> 00:57:52,920
earth.
That just,

1087
00:57:53,100 --> 00:57:55,140
when you hear that,
it just makes you think,

1088
00:57:55,141 --> 00:57:57,540
how could that be done?
How's that done?

1089
00:57:57,720 --> 00:57:58,650
The,
the numbers,

1090
00:57:58,660 --> 00:58:02,670
the conservative numbers are somewhere
around $20 million.

1091
00:58:02,970 --> 00:58:05,400
The liberal estimates go as high as 70.

1092
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:06,890
That's,
I mean,

1093
00:58:07,020 --> 00:58:09,960
it is an unreal number.
It's unreal.

1094
00:58:10,710 --> 00:58:15,710
But they were
arguably madmen,

1095
00:58:16,690 --> 00:58:18,930
madmen,
100 percent mean 100 percent.

1096
00:58:19,230 --> 00:58:23,130
It was crazy times.
That's all we'd go to.

1097
00:58:23,131 --> 00:58:25,290
If all of a sudden everyone's cell phone
shut off,

1098
00:58:25,430 --> 00:58:28,080
like the sun stopped.
Well,

1099
00:58:28,081 --> 00:58:31,320
if one group came along that was that
ruthless,

1100
00:58:31,350 --> 00:58:33,810
they're willing to take it that far.
I mean,

1101
00:58:33,930 --> 00:58:37,290
life in 1200 was just particularly
ruthless,

1102
00:58:37,291 --> 00:58:38,250
right?
I mean,

1103
00:58:38,251 --> 00:58:42,030
it was a brutal time to be alive.
There was no medicine.

1104
00:58:42,090 --> 00:58:44,730
There's no surgery.
There was very little,

1105
00:58:44,731 --> 00:58:47,880
at least very little sophistication.
And these people,

1106
00:58:47,881 --> 00:58:49,920
most of them lived in felt tense.
I mean,

1107
00:58:49,921 --> 00:58:51,360
that's what most of the Mongols lived
in.

1108
00:58:51,361 --> 00:58:54,240
I mean,
that's part of the name Gingiss Khan and

1109
00:58:54,241 --> 00:58:54,631
the,
uh,

1110
00:58:54,631 --> 00:58:55,090
the,
the,

1111
00:58:55,090 --> 00:58:55,650
the,
like,

1112
00:58:55,650 --> 00:58:57,540
his,
his,

1113
00:58:57,541 --> 00:59:00,240
uh,
doctrine that he lived by was that he

1114
00:59:00,241 --> 00:59:05,241
was the ruler of all who lived and felt
tense and he believed that people who

1115
00:59:06,091 --> 00:59:10,560
lived in tents or superior to people
that lived in homes and those people

1116
00:59:10,561 --> 00:59:13,230
that lived in homes,
they sort of dehumanize them.

1117
00:59:13,231 --> 00:59:16,020
They thought they were like,
there were pieces of shit living in a

1118
00:59:16,021 --> 00:59:16,410
house.

1119
00:59:16,410 --> 00:59:18,930
Fuck these people,
they can't even live in a tent.

1120
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:22,670
Like a civilized person.
You know,

1121
00:59:22,700 --> 00:59:23,750
they,
they were,

1122
00:59:23,780 --> 00:59:27,140
they were really crazy.
I always encourage people to do this,

1123
00:59:27,141 --> 00:59:28,580
but please,
if you're listening to this,

1124
00:59:28,730 --> 00:59:32,990
and this isn't at all intriguing,
go to Dan Carlin's hardcore history.

1125
00:59:32,991 --> 00:59:35,900
Apparently.
Now if you go on Itunes,

1126
00:59:35,901 --> 00:59:40,550
you have to pay for the wrath of the
cons ones because the way Dan Carlin's

1127
00:59:40,551 --> 00:59:43,520
works and it's only a dollar a show by
the way,

1128
00:59:43,521 --> 00:59:46,460
folks,
it's worth way more than that and you

1129
00:59:46,461 --> 00:59:46,751
say,
oh,

1130
00:59:46,751 --> 00:59:50,060
I paid for a podcast.
It's not really a podcast.

1131
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:52,640
This is a podcast.
John and I,

1132
00:59:52,850 --> 00:59:56,030
we hunted all day.
We had some dinner,

1133
00:59:56,390 --> 00:59:59,690
we had a couple of drinks and we said we
gotta do this podcast,

1134
00:59:59,780 --> 01:00:04,520
so we sat down were just shooting the
shit with Dan Carlin does is exhaustive

1135
01:00:04,521 --> 01:00:08,910
research and he works on these things
for months at a time and they're

1136
01:00:08,940 --> 01:00:11,750
essentially like hour and a half.

1137
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:16,430
Hard core history is the name of it,
but that is what it is,

1138
01:00:16,431 --> 01:00:21,431
is a hardcore historical audio book on
whatever subject it covers and all of

1139
01:00:23,511 --> 01:00:28,430
them are equally amazing and he the the
hardcore history series.

1140
01:00:28,431 --> 01:00:33,431
Unwrap the cons is a five part series.
It's one of my most cherished audio

1141
01:00:33,441 --> 01:00:35,000
recordings.
It's fucking incredible.

1142
01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:37,010
I've listened to it.
No bullshit.

1143
01:00:37,011 --> 01:00:40,130
Maybe 30 times.
I've just keep listening to it over and

1144
01:00:40,131 --> 01:00:41,960
over again.
Still absorb all the details because

1145
01:00:41,961 --> 01:00:43,370
it's so crazy.
These,

1146
01:00:43,610 --> 01:00:46,730
the way these people lived.
It is fascinating.

1147
01:00:46,770 --> 01:00:48,680
It's worth a bucket show.
Folks pay for it.

1148
01:00:48,950 --> 01:00:52,310
It's not like my show.
My show is a dollar show.

1149
01:00:52,490 --> 01:00:54,710
Go on bit torrent steel,
that fucking thing.

1150
01:00:56,020 --> 01:00:57,790
This,
this pay for it.

1151
01:00:57,830 --> 01:01:02,060
Pay For this because it's a work of art.
But um,

1152
01:01:02,360 --> 01:01:07,360
but archery until modern times consisted
of the,

1153
01:01:07,641 --> 01:01:08,530
you know,
the,

1154
01:01:08,570 --> 01:01:13,570
the sophisticated leaps in technology.
We're just like the recurve bow and more

1155
01:01:14,541 --> 01:01:19,541
efficient and better recoverable bows
and better materials until the compound

1156
01:01:19,761 --> 01:01:21,620
boat came along,
which was when,

1157
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:25,620
I don't know.
I'm trying to think when it was.

1158
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:28,200
I'm going to guess seven,
eight threadbare invented.

1159
01:01:28,201 --> 01:01:30,480
It didn't.
I think it was the Alan.

1160
01:01:31,170 --> 01:01:32,003
Oh,
was it?

1161
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:35,360
Okay.
Who invented the combat that combat poe?

1162
01:01:35,550 --> 01:01:39,910
Who invented the compound bow first?
Compound bow.

1163
01:01:39,980 --> 01:01:41,730
That's fine.
I'm not a historian.

1164
01:01:42,150 --> 01:01:44,640
How dare you not be a historian?
I just shoot.

1165
01:01:45,270 --> 01:01:46,440
All right.
Let's see.

1166
01:01:47,170 --> 01:01:50,160
What does it say here?
Why is Oprah crying?

1167
01:01:50,390 --> 01:01:51,830
Hopers kronos.
Shocking.

1168
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:53,670
Oprah secrets revealed.
Okay.

1169
01:01:54,030 --> 01:01:57,570
Wilbur Allen changed the face of archery
for everyone and he decided that he'd

1170
01:01:57,571 --> 01:02:02,571
make a bow by sawing off part of the
limbs are recurve and attaching police.

1171
01:02:03,380 --> 01:02:06,270
Nineteen sixties.
Okay.

1172
01:02:06,330 --> 01:02:09,510
My thing was fred bear,
I think I watched some bear archery

1173
01:02:09,511 --> 01:02:10,890
propaganda.
That's why.

1174
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:12,030
Dang it all.

1175
01:02:12,970 --> 01:02:15,340
Okay.
So a wholeness.

1176
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:19,260
H O l l e s s Wilbur Allen.
Hmm.

1177
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:21,510
Yep.
And that was in the 19 sixties.

1178
01:02:21,511 --> 01:02:26,511
That's interesting because that looks
like a modern day elite po inside joke

1179
01:02:26,941 --> 01:02:29,610
folks.
Just kidding if you're an elite shooter

1180
01:02:29,611 --> 01:02:30,840
and you're like,
what the fuck?

1181
01:02:31,260 --> 01:02:32,940
You didn't know shit about our true.
You're right.

1182
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,110
I don't.
I'm just joking.

1183
01:02:34,140 --> 01:02:35,390
Yeah,
we're googling stuff.

1184
01:02:35,430 --> 01:02:37,380
Don't get a docket.
So uppity.

1185
01:02:37,930 --> 01:02:40,060
Don't get so attached to your shit.
Goddammit.

1186
01:02:40,560 --> 01:02:45,560
I'm so 19 sixties is when it became what
it is now or the beginning of what it is

1187
01:02:47,851 --> 01:02:49,590
now.
But what we're shooting

1188
01:02:51,750 --> 01:02:54,720
right before I was born,
what we're shooting with now is these

1189
01:02:54,780 --> 01:02:58,340
new horror hoyt pro defiance.
Um,

1190
01:02:58,360 --> 01:03:03,360
and this one that I got literally three
days ago is the best barber shop.

1191
01:03:03,990 --> 01:03:06,150
It's amazing.
It's so good.

1192
01:03:06,151 --> 01:03:09,960
It feels so good when you,
when you shoot with it so smooth and

1193
01:03:09,961 --> 01:03:11,750
it's so accurate.
It's,

1194
01:03:11,780 --> 01:03:15,240
it's incredible how far the technology
has come.

1195
01:03:15,660 --> 01:03:18,240
I mean,
we're shooting today out to 80 yards and

1196
01:03:18,300 --> 01:03:23,100
shy the day before that,
85 yards and regularly placing it in the

1197
01:03:23,101 --> 01:03:26,180
10 range at 80 yards.
Yeah,

1198
01:03:26,181 --> 01:03:28,680
I mean that is,
that's incredible.

1199
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:30,540
Sophistication and technology.

1200
01:03:30,590 --> 01:03:32,880
And you're shooting 84 pounds.
Yeah.

1201
01:03:32,900 --> 01:03:36,200
It's heavy with a 500 green arrow.
It's,

1202
01:03:36,530 --> 01:03:41,530
I mean that is Shit's gonna die
ballistic heads would would implode if

1203
01:03:42,381 --> 01:03:44,490
you were hitting them.
Like if you're shooting,

1204
01:03:44,500 --> 01:03:46,790
if you were at Oakley.
Oh yeah.

1205
01:03:46,791 --> 01:03:49,130
That's a new backs.
That's a different thing.

1206
01:03:49,820 --> 01:03:50,930
Yeah.
That's the kind of.

1207
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:52,940
Yeah.
Well we had this discussion though.

1208
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:56,300
It's all about what you can physically
manage.

1209
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:58,830
We had this discussion on your podcasts.
You listen to this podcast,

1210
01:03:58,831 --> 01:04:01,550
want to hear another drunk and rambling
bullshit fast.

1211
01:04:01,551 --> 01:04:05,340
John John,
John and I did an episode of knock on,

1212
01:04:05,490 --> 01:04:08,400
which is if you get into archery,
John's podcast is,

1213
01:04:08,401 --> 01:04:11,670
in my opinion,
the best archery podcast in the world.

1214
01:04:11,850 --> 01:04:14,910
It's the most informative and it's how
John and I became friends.

1215
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:18,850
We became friends because I went to
Hawaii and I'm hoyt.

1216
01:04:18,870 --> 01:04:22,290
The company that makes these bows.
I went there with my family because I

1217
01:04:22,291 --> 01:04:24,960
was in Salt Lake and I made.
I don't like skiing,

1218
01:04:24,961 --> 01:04:26,010
man.
I don't like it.

1219
01:04:26,070 --> 01:04:29,190
It's fucking boring to me,
but I do it because my family likes it.

1220
01:04:29,570 --> 01:04:31,990
Like we were going down the hill.
We in my car,

1221
01:04:31,991 --> 01:04:33,270
I'll go,
I'll go fine.

1222
01:04:33,590 --> 01:04:36,150
Oh,
but please can we just stop in Salt Lake

1223
01:04:36,150 --> 01:04:38,250
City so I can visit the factory.
I want to check it out.

1224
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:39,310
So,
uh,

1225
01:04:39,310 --> 01:04:43,170
and I was in there and I was talking to
Mike looper and Mike looper,

1226
01:04:43,171 --> 01:04:46,020
one of the big wigs over at hoyt.
And I was telling them,

1227
01:04:46,021 --> 01:04:47,070
I go,
I listened to that.

1228
01:04:47,100 --> 01:04:50,340
John Dudley's podcasts all the time.
I'd podcast amazing.

1229
01:04:50,610 --> 01:04:53,360
I'm like,
it's so informative and then loop or

1230
01:04:53,361 --> 01:04:55,710
told you.
And then somehow or another he connected

1231
01:04:55,711 --> 01:04:58,980
us and next thing you know,
you're giving me some coaching and.

1232
01:04:59,060 --> 01:04:59,780
Well,
here,

1233
01:04:59,780 --> 01:05:02,450
it's funny because Mike,
a practical joker,

1234
01:05:02,630 --> 01:05:07,070
he's always like,
he'll always call and then he starts out

1235
01:05:07,071 --> 01:05:07,904
with like,

1236
01:05:08,050 --> 01:05:09,290
hi,
is Mr Dodd living

1237
01:05:09,490 --> 01:05:13,090
like he always does these different
voices and he,

1238
01:05:13,120 --> 01:05:15,460
he's always playing jokes one.
Anyway,

1239
01:05:15,730 --> 01:05:19,000
we,
Sharon and I went to Hawaii like in two

1240
01:05:19,001 --> 01:05:20,920
hours after you were there.
Oh,

1241
01:05:20,921 --> 01:05:22,690
that's funny.
And um,

1242
01:05:23,650 --> 01:05:26,260
we pull in and then Mike's like,
dude,

1243
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:30,010
Brogan was just here and he loves your
podcast.

1244
01:05:30,011 --> 01:05:31,090
And I'm like,
thinking,

1245
01:05:31,180 --> 01:05:32,010
here we go.

1246
01:05:32,010 --> 01:05:32,843
No.

1247
01:05:33,990 --> 01:05:35,040
He's like,
no,

1248
01:05:35,041 --> 01:05:36,120
seriously.
And I'm like,

1249
01:05:36,150 --> 01:05:36,721
Oh yeah,
it does.

1250
01:05:36,721 --> 01:05:37,261
He.
And he's like,

1251
01:05:37,261 --> 01:05:38,190
yeah.
And he's like,

1252
01:05:38,191 --> 01:05:40,440
he's in town,
he's skin and he's going to go over to

1253
01:05:40,441 --> 01:05:41,700
the western expo.
And I said,

1254
01:05:41,701 --> 01:05:44,760
well that's what we're here for.
We're going to be over at the western

1255
01:05:44,761 --> 01:05:45,990
expo.
Because we were,

1256
01:05:46,050 --> 01:05:51,050
we actually went for felt bikes because
felt put their bikes at the western

1257
01:05:51,601 --> 01:05:53,040
expo.
And they said,

1258
01:05:53,041 --> 01:05:55,440
well,
you come here and like give a testimony

1259
01:05:55,441 --> 01:05:57,440
that you use these things will explain
what it is

1260
01:05:57,470 --> 01:05:58,190
felt.
Bike is.

1261
01:05:58,190 --> 01:06:00,710
We've been using them all week.
They're awesome.

1262
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:04,640
They're their mountain bikes that have
like assisted.

1263
01:06:05,110 --> 01:06:06,610
He,
it's an Ebay,

1264
01:06:07,030 --> 01:06:09,640
so it's um,
it has a pedal assist.

1265
01:06:10,080 --> 01:06:14,500
It has a bosh motor on it and as long as
you're pedaling,

1266
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:17,590
you can,
it has a battery that you charge and as

1267
01:06:17,591 --> 01:06:20,260
long as you're pedaling,
you can,

1268
01:06:20,380 --> 01:06:25,380
you have four settings and you can use a
setting where it actually assists you.

1269
01:06:26,560 --> 01:06:29,830
And it,
the way I describe it as each one of

1270
01:06:29,831 --> 01:06:33,520
those numbers,
whether it's eco sport to her,

1271
01:06:33,970 --> 01:06:35,980
um,
turbo turbo,

1272
01:06:36,040 --> 01:06:40,510
whichever one it is,
it's almost like that is equal to one

1273
01:06:40,511 --> 01:06:41,150
other person

1274
01:06:41,150 --> 01:06:43,310
being on your bike.
I want to just tell you something,

1275
01:06:43,340 --> 01:06:46,280
I never used those things with anything
less than terrible.

1276
01:06:46,460 --> 01:06:47,790
Whatever it was set out.
I was like,

1277
01:06:47,810 --> 01:06:49,360
Turbo shut the fuck up.

1278
01:06:50,660 --> 01:06:53,840
And they're unbelievable.
As long as you're turning the pedals,

1279
01:06:54,130 --> 01:06:55,700
is that they'll go set.
Yeah,

1280
01:06:55,780 --> 01:06:59,300
they'll go 17 miles an hour,
which I think is what by law.

1281
01:06:59,360 --> 01:07:03,920
Anything that goes over that,
I think it it gets kind of classify it

1282
01:07:03,921 --> 01:07:08,921
as a different type of.
It's not eligible to go on a non

1283
01:07:09,861 --> 01:07:14,861
motorized trails so you can use these
bikes on non motorized pass,

1284
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:18,370
like in Montana and stuff.
You'd be able to take these like we're

1285
01:07:18,440 --> 01:07:21,290
green tree went.
You'd be able to take a bike on that

1286
01:07:21,291 --> 01:07:24,380
same trail.
Well what's important about it is two

1287
01:07:24,381 --> 01:07:25,400
things.
One,

1288
01:07:25,550 --> 01:07:29,840
you can charge these things with solar
power because they're electrical and to.

1289
01:07:30,290 --> 01:07:35,290
One of the things that happens in these
cold weather hunts is you hike far and

1290
01:07:35,781 --> 01:07:39,710
wide up mountains and if you're not,
if you didn't do a good job of layering,

1291
01:07:40,070 --> 01:07:44,690
so like you might have too much clothes
on on the way up there and you start

1292
01:07:44,691 --> 01:07:48,020
sweating and then once you get there
then you're hunting.

1293
01:07:48,021 --> 01:07:50,480
So you're not climbing hills anymore.
You're stop.

1294
01:07:50,510 --> 01:07:55,510
Now you're stop and you fucking phrase.
And Hypothermia is the number one cause

1295
01:07:56,571 --> 01:07:58,430
of death in the mountains.
Is it number one?

1296
01:07:58,431 --> 01:08:01,250
Yes.
It kills more people than grizzly bears.

1297
01:08:01,251 --> 01:08:02,960
Rattlesnakes,
mountain lions.

1298
01:08:03,140 --> 01:08:05,600
People fucking freeze to death.
And when,

1299
01:08:05,630 --> 01:08:08,630
when you're up there and you sweat and
you,

1300
01:08:08,631 --> 01:08:13,370
especially if you were in cotton,
one of the biggest improvements that

1301
01:08:13,371 --> 01:08:17,630
people figured out was Merino,
because if you were a merino wool,

1302
01:08:17,631 --> 01:08:20,270
there's something about the natural
fibers in,

1303
01:08:20,330 --> 01:08:25,190
in wool that allow you to stay warm.
Air Resistance is,

1304
01:08:25,191 --> 01:08:27,620
it is the under armour shirt.
Well,

1305
01:08:27,621 --> 01:08:32,060
I'm first light has an awesome a Merino
wool selection.

1306
01:08:32,300 --> 01:08:35,900
You has a lot of Merino wool and under
Harvard,

1307
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:38,540
which what I'm wearing right now,
they have a bunch of Merino wool stuff

1308
01:08:38,570 --> 01:08:40,760
too.
They've had a ton of different styles.

1309
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:42,920
Yeah.
Merino wool is like,

1310
01:08:42,980 --> 01:08:47,980
it's a big with the hiking crowd and
outdoorsman or backpackers and stuff

1311
01:08:48,150 --> 01:08:48,760
will

1312
01:08:48,760 --> 01:08:51,790
amazing characteristics.
There's a lot of cool stories about.

1313
01:08:51,791 --> 01:08:55,510
Well,
people that were on like plane crashes

1314
01:08:55,511 --> 01:08:58,500
are shipwrecks.
And the only ones that survived see were

1315
01:08:58,510 --> 01:09:01,510
the ones that had wool.
Everyone else would die of hypothermia.

1316
01:09:02,320 --> 01:09:03,370
When we,
um,

1317
01:09:03,460 --> 01:09:06,040
I was with a company that did some
Merino wool,

1318
01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:09,820
started a line of Merino wool.
So we brought in a lot of specialists

1319
01:09:09,821 --> 01:09:14,350
from New Zealand that actually showed us
the different kinds of marina wool.

1320
01:09:14,351 --> 01:09:16,300
And stuff,
and then that's when he started to learn

1321
01:09:16,301 --> 01:09:20,660
a lot about the stories of Merino wool
and a lot of them,

1322
01:09:20,720 --> 01:09:24,440
there's a ton of survivor stories with
people that would wear will versus

1323
01:09:24,441 --> 01:09:27,580
trying to where other types of
synthetics and like,

1324
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:30,140
you know,
obviously that was an extreme case.

1325
01:09:30,750 --> 01:09:32,700
Um,
so it was pretty interesting.

1326
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:35,250
That's fascinating.
You know nothing about it.

1327
01:09:35,260 --> 01:09:38,940
Is it for whatever reason it doesn't
stink.

1328
01:09:39,030 --> 01:09:40,920
Yeah.
Like I've been wearing wool socks.

1329
01:09:40,921 --> 01:09:43,170
I will always wear wool socks.
Um,

1330
01:09:43,310 --> 01:09:47,490
when I would do any type of hunting or
hiking or anything where I know my feet

1331
01:09:47,491 --> 01:09:49,650
are going to be sweating.
It makes such a big difference.

1332
01:09:49,651 --> 01:09:51,780
You take off her socks,
it doesn't even smell your warm.

1333
01:09:51,820 --> 01:09:55,170
Doesn't make any sense.
Whereas if I were cotton socks,

1334
01:09:55,200 --> 01:10:00,200
it smells like someone died in my shoes
as a Goddamn Eco castrophe going on

1335
01:10:00,540 --> 01:10:02,260
inside of my Nike's.
It's,

1336
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:05,330
it's horrible.
The smell like if you work out all day

1337
01:10:05,330 --> 01:10:06,450
and to keep your,
your,

1338
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:09,870
your socks on,
they just sweat and then fester and the

1339
01:10:10,050 --> 01:10:14,040
bacteria grows.
There's some natural antimicrobial

1340
01:10:14,041 --> 01:10:17,220
properties of a,
of Merino wool.

1341
01:10:17,490 --> 01:10:19,410
It's awesome stuff.
Very awesome.

1342
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:22,260
So felt bikes,
great.

1343
01:10:22,261 --> 01:10:23,094
Western Bank

1344
01:10:24,270 --> 01:10:29,270
tells me that you're,
that you liked the podcast and he could

1345
01:10:31,371 --> 01:10:35,630
tell by my face.
I figured this was another one of the

1346
01:10:35,630 --> 01:10:36,890
Michael Hooper Pranks.
So I was like,

1347
01:10:36,920 --> 01:10:38,000
okay.
And I said,

1348
01:10:38,001 --> 01:10:41,720
well,
I said if he wants to hook up then you

1349
01:10:41,721 --> 01:10:44,450
know,
then connect us or whatever.

1350
01:10:45,290 --> 01:10:48,260
So we're back to the hotel and Sharon
and I,

1351
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:53,320
we went and checked in.
We're there maybe two hours and Mike

1352
01:10:54,031 --> 01:10:57,080
texts me,
he says Joe and camera and the mountain

1353
01:10:57,081 --> 01:11:02,081
ops booth right now I'm doing a podcast.
Go by there and say hi to him.

1354
01:11:06,380 --> 01:11:07,700
And I'm like,
Oh really?

1355
01:11:07,790 --> 01:11:09,290
And he said yeah.
And I'm like,

1356
01:11:09,320 --> 01:11:12,350
okay.
So I literally hung up with them and I

1357
01:11:12,351 --> 01:11:13,350
told Sharon,
I'm like,

1358
01:11:13,910 --> 01:11:15,300
yeah,
I'm not going over there.

1359
01:11:15,380 --> 01:11:18,120
I said,
I'll guarantee you they're doing a

1360
01:11:18,121 --> 01:11:20,400
podcast and I'm going to go over there
and be like,

1361
01:11:20,430 --> 01:11:23,610
Hey Jill,
Mike told me that you wanted to meet me

1362
01:11:23,940 --> 01:11:25,690
and then he'd be like,
who the effort?

1363
01:11:27,380 --> 01:11:30,190
I just like,
Mike's like,

1364
01:11:30,191 --> 01:11:31,390
did you,
did you connect

1365
01:11:31,430 --> 01:11:32,121
for them?
I said,

1366
01:11:32,121 --> 01:11:33,290
no.
And he's like,

1367
01:11:33,291 --> 01:11:34,550
why not?
And I said,

1368
01:11:34,940 --> 01:11:36,530
well,
I thought I didn't believe you.

1369
01:11:37,130 --> 01:11:39,680
So he was crying wolf too many times.
See,

1370
01:11:39,790 --> 01:11:42,350
I didn't take him serious when he was
telling the truth,

1371
01:11:42,740 --> 01:11:47,000
but then you called me out on twitter,
which I wasn't really a twitter guy.

1372
01:11:47,620 --> 01:11:49,840
You kind of,
I think you sent me something or you

1373
01:11:49,850 --> 01:11:50,900
said something and then

1374
01:11:51,390 --> 01:11:53,820
I think I just said how much your
podcast is awesome.

1375
01:11:53,940 --> 01:11:56,670
Yeah.
And I got blasted by all my friends.

1376
01:11:56,671 --> 01:11:57,061
I'm like,
God,

1377
01:11:57,061 --> 01:11:59,490
Joe Rogan's talking about your podcast.
So.

1378
01:12:00,090 --> 01:12:02,020
Well,
this is very rare that someone

1379
01:12:02,021 --> 01:12:07,000
specializes in something to the extreme
that you do with archery where you don't

1380
01:12:07,001 --> 01:12:11,050
even like when I do a podcast in this
podcast is a perfect example.

1381
01:12:11,110 --> 01:12:13,090
Many times during this podcast I've had
to say,

1382
01:12:13,300 --> 01:12:14,950
well,
for people who don't know that means

1383
01:12:14,951 --> 01:12:17,080
this.
Or for people who haven't heard that,

1384
01:12:17,081 --> 01:12:19,300
that's a.
You don't even bother doing that.

1385
01:12:19,480 --> 01:12:23,820
You start talking about AC tends
different campaigns.

1386
01:12:24,690 --> 01:12:28,390
Zx K no you shouldn't because what
you're doing is you're.

1387
01:12:28,391 --> 01:12:33,391
You are a hard core archery podcasts and
it is,

1388
01:12:34,860 --> 01:12:37,450
you know,
catch up if you can stay with it,

1389
01:12:37,451 --> 01:12:39,550
if you can,
but you go deep,

1390
01:12:39,551 --> 01:12:42,550
deep,
deep into all of the variables of

1391
01:12:42,580 --> 01:12:46,210
archery.
And for me it makes me understand and

1392
01:12:46,211 --> 01:12:47,470
appreciate.
I still is.

1393
01:12:47,500 --> 01:12:52,500
I mean I've been shooting bows for a few
years now and really hardcore for most

1394
01:12:53,081 --> 01:12:55,330
of the time,
like really into it most of the time

1395
01:12:55,720 --> 01:12:57,460
still.
There's a lot of shit you talk about.

1396
01:12:57,540 --> 01:13:01,420
I don't know what the fuck you're saying
because it's so.

1397
01:13:01,570 --> 01:13:04,390
It's so detailed.
There's so much going on,

1398
01:13:04,540 --> 01:13:07,960
but also because you were very
successful target archer,

1399
01:13:08,290 --> 01:13:09,310
which is,
you know,

1400
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:11,440
uh,
of course you see in,

1401
01:13:11,540 --> 01:13:13,090
you know,
you've seen on television in the

1402
01:13:13,091 --> 01:13:15,640
Olympics and all this different stuff.
Target archery,

1403
01:13:15,641 --> 01:13:20,641
which is almost as specialized and weird
in its own way as hunting as bowhunting.

1404
01:13:22,900 --> 01:13:23,733
Yeah.

1405
01:13:24,120 --> 01:13:25,800
Yeah.
Target our trees.

1406
01:13:27,180 --> 01:13:32,010
You learn so much about the sport one,
you really start to have to learn your

1407
01:13:32,011 --> 01:13:34,050
equipment.
And then for me,

1408
01:13:34,051 --> 01:13:39,051
I really learned a whole new aspect of
just competitiveness,

1409
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:43,410
preparation,
diet,

1410
01:13:43,680 --> 01:13:46,200
how to travel,
how to travel smart.

1411
01:13:46,770 --> 01:13:48,360
Um,
because it's,

1412
01:13:48,420 --> 01:13:52,260
it's a huge investment to go to
tournaments across the world.

1413
01:13:52,261 --> 01:13:55,050
You know,
you look at some of those over there,

1414
01:13:55,051 --> 01:13:59,010
you know,
from Poland or Sweden or what was the

1415
01:13:59,011 --> 01:14:02,390
biggest tournament that you won?
I don't know.

1416
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:05,310
They're all different.
They're all different.

1417
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:11,070
I don't think anyone of them.
I always liked winning the team rounds

1418
01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:15,790
the best.
I always loved shooting team rounds.

1419
01:14:15,791 --> 01:14:20,380
I got really pumped up with that.
I don't really remember very many of

1420
01:14:20,381 --> 01:14:21,700
them.
I do remember,

1421
01:14:21,701 --> 01:14:25,610
but I don't see what's,
what I was trying to get to.

1422
01:14:25,630 --> 01:14:30,250
And this segues into it.
I started cheating competitive archery

1423
01:14:30,251 --> 01:14:31,430
to be a better bow hunter.

1424
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:36,040
That's the only reason I competed
because I was in the same mental state

1425
01:14:36,041 --> 01:14:37,810
is what you were of,
okay,

1426
01:14:38,260 --> 01:14:41,860
if I'm going to go out and do this,
I want to know that if I've got one

1427
01:14:41,861 --> 01:14:44,440
shot,
I want to make sure that it's right.

1428
01:14:45,010 --> 01:14:47,800
Because when I started I was never
taught properly.

1429
01:14:47,830 --> 01:14:50,740
I was just,
we hunted a lot for our family's food.

1430
01:14:50,741 --> 01:14:55,741
I was down in Mississippi when I was
younger where I lived and I made a lot

1431
01:14:56,981 --> 01:15:00,190
of mistakes.
I would miss a lot and just,

1432
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:01,840
you know,
I was self taught.

1433
01:15:01,841 --> 01:15:03,880
I think I was with a lot of people that
just like,

1434
01:15:03,950 --> 01:15:06,220
you know,
they'd pick it up and just try to do it

1435
01:15:06,730 --> 01:15:10,240
and you spend a lot of time sitting and
waiting for an opportunity and then when

1436
01:15:10,241 --> 01:15:12,640
you blow it,
it's extremely frustrating.

1437
01:15:13,180 --> 01:15:16,070
So I just decided to start shooting
competitive archery.

1438
01:15:16,070 --> 01:15:18,520
You know,
I ended up shooting one little

1439
01:15:18,521 --> 01:15:20,410
tournament and then all sudden I
realized,

1440
01:15:20,440 --> 01:15:24,610
wait a minute,
this is what's going to make me a really

1441
01:15:24,611 --> 01:15:28,780
good bowhunter if.
Because when I shot my first tournament,

1442
01:15:29,890 --> 01:15:34,890
it made me realize how bad of a hunter I
was from a point of being able to make a

1443
01:15:35,321 --> 01:15:37,030
shot.
So I'm like,

1444
01:15:37,031 --> 01:15:40,480
I have to get better at this because if
I'm going to be hunting and I'm going to

1445
01:15:40,481 --> 01:15:42,940
be spending that much time for an
opportunity,

1446
01:15:43,270 --> 01:15:46,030
I have to be able to seize the moment.
So.

1447
01:15:46,360 --> 01:15:48,780
And the reason I left the,
the U,

1448
01:15:48,781 --> 01:15:53,070
s team was because that year,
um,

1449
01:15:53,590 --> 01:15:58,590
when they posted the schedule,
the World Cup final was at the end of

1450
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:04,900
September and so I knew that September
would be training and then we'd have to

1451
01:16:04,901 --> 01:16:09,901
fly mid September.
So if I wasn't willing to commit to go

1452
01:16:10,151 --> 01:16:14,470
to the World Cup final that I wasn't,
I couldn't stay on the team.

1453
01:16:14,500 --> 01:16:18,370
So that was elk season.
I mean,

1454
01:16:18,610 --> 01:16:21,430
and that's actually what I said.
I just told them,

1455
01:16:21,431 --> 01:16:22,510
I said,
listen,

1456
01:16:22,600 --> 01:16:26,050
I don't,
I do not shoot tournaments between

1457
01:16:26,051 --> 01:16:29,530
September and December.
That's it.

1458
01:16:30,790 --> 01:16:31,800
And they,
I said,

1459
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:34,660
I won't be doing that tournament if
that's what it is.

1460
01:16:34,661 --> 01:16:35,620
And then they just said,
well,

1461
01:16:35,621 --> 01:16:37,150
you're not going to be able to stay on
the team.

1462
01:16:37,780 --> 01:16:38,830
And just said,
okay,

1463
01:16:39,110 --> 01:16:39,943
and that was it.

1464
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:42,330
Don't get it.
They never heard of

1465
01:16:44,150 --> 01:16:48,780
that thousand pound forest horse with
swords coming out of its head running

1466
01:16:48,781 --> 01:16:53,781
over the top of the hill until you've
seen a bugling elk in the Rut.

1467
01:16:54,530 --> 01:16:59,190
So just foaming at the mouth and jizzing
all over himself,

1468
01:16:59,250 --> 01:17:04,250
literally jizzing all over himself and
does massive majestic beast that looks

1469
01:17:06,511 --> 01:17:09,440
like it's like in the Lord of the rings
or something.

1470
01:17:09,441 --> 01:17:11,120
I mean it really is.
There was a,

1471
01:17:11,330 --> 01:17:14,330
someone puts something up on twitter and
I thought it was really interesting

1472
01:17:14,331 --> 01:17:19,331
because it was from the perspective of
someone who's a complete non hunter and

1473
01:17:19,461 --> 01:17:23,450
it was a,
it was just a bugling elk screaming and

1474
01:17:23,451 --> 01:17:27,770
they were like the most insane sounds
that elk make when they bugle.

1475
01:17:27,890 --> 01:17:29,510
And the comments were like,
Whoa,

1476
01:17:29,511 --> 01:17:34,511
this thing is like some mythical beast
because somebody caught a really cool,

1477
01:17:34,851 --> 01:17:35,684
like,
you know,

1478
01:17:35,900 --> 01:17:39,530
like people,
they have different voices and some elk

1479
01:17:39,531 --> 01:17:41,180
have just bad ass voice.

1480
01:17:41,810 --> 01:17:45,440
Especially those heard bowls like the
way elk works.

1481
01:17:45,470 --> 01:17:46,580
Folks,
if you don't know,

1482
01:17:46,970 --> 01:17:50,180
there'll be.
Like when I was Al Connie recently,

1483
01:17:50,540 --> 01:17:55,170
last month cam and I found this one bowl
that uh,

1484
01:17:55,171 --> 01:18:00,170
at the ranch they were calling the sword
bull because he had just these crazy

1485
01:18:00,171 --> 01:18:03,950
long beams growing out of the side of
his head.

1486
01:18:03,951 --> 01:18:07,850
It was like a really odd.
Sometimes you get odd shaped beams that

1487
01:18:07,851 --> 01:18:12,851
grow out of these animals heads and he
was the of the ranch and there was like,

1488
01:18:14,030 --> 01:18:19,030
he had at least 12 chicks with them,
12 female cows and that's a pretty small

1489
01:18:19,970 --> 01:18:23,510
following them everywhere.
That's a pretty small high heroin.

1490
01:18:23,570 --> 01:18:27,200
Well for Immuno herd bull I guess,
but it was watching,

1491
01:18:27,440 --> 01:18:31,460
watching all the little satellite bowls
hang around this guy,

1492
01:18:31,640 --> 01:18:33,620
there's like a few like,
hey girls.

1493
01:18:33,630 --> 01:18:35,180
I'm pretty cool too.
He's like,

1494
01:18:35,181 --> 01:18:38,060
shut up.
And then they would run them off.

1495
01:18:38,061 --> 01:18:40,580
Was he a Groaner?
He was a screamer.

1496
01:18:41,120 --> 01:18:45,320
Does
that sound that they make?

1497
01:18:45,321 --> 01:18:45,790
But

1498
01:18:45,790 --> 01:18:46,290
yeah,
no,

1499
01:18:46,290 --> 01:18:48,280
it was.
Some of the ones that get blown out,

1500
01:18:48,281 --> 01:18:49,960
they just get to the point where they're
like,

1501
01:18:49,990 --> 01:18:52,810
it's like a bull frog.
Like a real old one.

1502
01:18:53,200 --> 01:18:55,280
They can't really beautiful anymore.
So they're just like,

1503
01:18:58,350 --> 01:18:59,760
sounds terrible.

1504
01:19:00,570 --> 01:19:01,840
But you know,
they're called,

1505
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:05,160
you know,
everyone calls him like groaners and um,

1506
01:19:05,220 --> 01:19:09,300
if you're an elk country,
when you hear real blown out bugle like

1507
01:19:09,301 --> 01:19:09,961
that,
you know,

1508
01:19:09,961 --> 01:19:13,650
it's probably a super old bull.
Have you ever seen an Irish elk?

1509
01:19:14,470 --> 01:19:15,280
Now?
What is that?

1510
01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:17,230
You haven't know what is.
They're extinct now.

1511
01:19:17,231 --> 01:19:20,490
Check this out dude.
You have to Google this and

1512
01:19:22,360 --> 01:19:27,130
I'm right here with the role roam the
earth right here.

1513
01:19:27,480 --> 01:19:29,050
Whoa.
Oh my God.

1514
01:19:29,110 --> 01:19:30,610
They were.
They were awesome.

1515
01:19:30,611 --> 01:19:32,050
Look at that thing.
Is that awesome?

1516
01:19:32,051 --> 01:19:34,660
Or what?
It looks like a combination of a stag

1517
01:19:34,661 --> 01:19:38,350
and an elk,
but they're way more massive.

1518
01:19:38,530 --> 01:19:40,540
There's still fine and some look at
that.

1519
01:19:40,770 --> 01:19:42,170
Oh,
it's like a Mousse

1520
01:19:42,670 --> 01:19:43,630
thing.
It's,

1521
01:19:43,631 --> 01:19:45,520
yeah,
it's an Irish elk.

1522
01:19:45,540 --> 01:19:47,920
You need to look them up.
They're amazing.

1523
01:19:47,950 --> 01:19:50,190
When did they die off?
Um,

1524
01:19:50,620 --> 01:19:53,740
I think it said 20th century.
No kidding.

1525
01:19:55,370 --> 01:19:56,330
Wow.

1526
01:19:57,580 --> 01:19:58,510
Let's see.
Wait,

1527
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:00,220
no,
let's look at it right here.

1528
01:20:02,390 --> 01:20:07,390
Most remains of Irish show date between
11 slash seven slash 54

1529
01:20:08,100 --> 01:20:10,740
present.
So definitely not the 20th century.

1530
01:20:12,240 --> 01:20:14,610
I wonder why they died off.
That's interesting.

1531
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:18,240
I don't know.
There was a enormous,

1532
01:20:18,450 --> 01:20:21,540
um,
Eagle that you still live in New

1533
01:20:21,540 --> 01:20:24,930
Zealand.
I'm trying to remember the name of it.

1534
01:20:25,340 --> 01:20:25,830
Uh,
ge,

1535
01:20:25,830 --> 01:20:29,220
Google,
enormous eagle in New Zealand.

1536
01:20:31,030 --> 01:20:32,850
I forgot.
I'm trying to remember.

1537
01:20:33,020 --> 01:20:38,020
Nervous Eagle,
New Zealand because they'll give you a

1538
01:20:38,161 --> 01:20:38,911
heartbeat.
Ego,

1539
01:20:38,911 --> 01:20:41,310
which is,
which is the,

1540
01:20:41,311 --> 01:20:42,300
uh,
the biggest,

1541
01:20:42,301 --> 01:20:44,500
uh,
Eagle that exists today.

1542
01:20:44,520 --> 01:20:46,170
You know,
you can just go like that and then like

1543
01:20:46,171 --> 01:20:47,550
that.
Oh,

1544
01:20:47,610 --> 01:20:49,460
you hit the download.
Haast Eagle.

1545
01:20:49,470 --> 01:20:51,810
That's it.
That was the biggest eagle ever.

1546
01:20:51,870 --> 01:20:53,670
And they were so big.
They would eat people.

1547
01:20:54,650 --> 01:20:55,830
What?
500,

1548
01:20:55,831 --> 01:20:57,510
10 pounds.
Are you kid?

1549
01:20:57,520 --> 01:20:57,990
Yeah.
Yeah.

1550
01:20:57,990 --> 01:21:00,360
They had a 10 foot waves.
You get that freaking thing.

1551
01:21:00,630 --> 01:21:05,340
Five hundred and 10 pounds eagle with a
10 foot wingspan.

1552
01:21:05,490 --> 01:21:07,740
Hello?
That's straight out of Harry Potter,

1553
01:21:07,741 --> 01:21:08,574
Dude.
Yeah.

1554
01:21:08,610 --> 01:21:12,300
Amazing.
And they were so big and so powerful.

1555
01:21:12,420 --> 01:21:15,600
And New Zealand,
if you don't know,

1556
01:21:16,470 --> 01:21:20,160
does not have a lot of indigenous
mammals.

1557
01:21:20,190 --> 01:21:25,140
New Zealand was really shut off from the
rest of the world.

1558
01:21:25,141 --> 01:21:28,500
Yeah,
it's called h a s t dot eagle.

1559
01:21:28,890 --> 01:21:32,490
It was a new and they,
I believe they went extinct in the 14

1560
01:21:32,491 --> 01:21:33,151
hundreds.
I would,

1561
01:21:33,151 --> 01:21:37,800
it says 1400.
And the reason why they went extinct,

1562
01:21:38,130 --> 01:21:40,200
uh,
they were hunted to extinction by the

1563
01:21:40,201 --> 01:21:43,950
first mowery,
but that is a little bit controversial.

1564
01:21:44,490 --> 01:21:46,770
Some people think that it wasn't
necessarily that,

1565
01:21:46,950 --> 01:21:51,030
but that the mowery ate everything that
they ate and they didn't have any food

1566
01:21:51,031 --> 01:21:54,060
left,
but there were a lot of accounts by the

1567
01:21:54,061 --> 01:21:57,540
mowery of them eating people.
Oh my God.

1568
01:21:57,541 --> 01:22:00,480
Look at the size of this Irish.
See you're not appreciating it.

1569
01:22:00,510 --> 01:22:03,540
I've seen it.
I've seen an actual one that's in a

1570
01:22:03,541 --> 01:22:08,541
museum,
so it says two point 10 meters tall to

1571
01:22:08,791 --> 01:22:12,840
the bottom of the bottom of the bottom,
like before the face.

1572
01:22:13,440 --> 01:22:15,360
Why do they measure their.
Why don't they mentioned at the time of

1573
01:22:15,361 --> 01:22:18,450
his head,
so that's way bigger than a regular elk.

1574
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:21,990
Way Bigger,
way bigger.

1575
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:24,330
That looks like it's several thousand
pounds.

1576
01:22:24,630 --> 01:22:26,580
Look at that picture.
These people next to it.

1577
01:22:28,130 --> 01:22:30,540
Oh my God.
Oh my God.

1578
01:22:30,570 --> 01:22:33,080
Folks,
what it looks like is a bowl with the

1579
01:22:33,081 --> 01:22:37,680
long legs and like a Moose on steroids.
Antlers.

1580
01:22:38,130 --> 01:22:39,990
Wow.
Irish elk.

1581
01:22:40,170 --> 01:22:41,370
Aren't they cool.
See,

1582
01:22:41,440 --> 01:22:43,920
fascinating.
Back woolly mammoths.

1583
01:22:44,190 --> 01:22:47,730
They need to bring back that thing and
do it on New Zealand so he can hunt it.

1584
01:22:48,830 --> 01:22:50,790
Make you know.
That's another.

1585
01:22:51,160 --> 01:22:55,260
Like in New Zealand,
it's kind of weird because they don't

1586
01:22:55,261 --> 01:22:59,950
have a hunting tags or seasons for most
of their animals,

1587
01:22:59,951 --> 01:23:04,110
so you just go there and fucking go
crazy and shoot everything because they

1588
01:23:04,111 --> 01:23:06,010
have no predators.
So they

1589
01:23:06,010 --> 01:23:08,150
have all these.
Yeah,

1590
01:23:08,200 --> 01:23:11,950
they have all these ungulates,
all these animals that exists there and

1591
01:23:12,310 --> 01:23:16,780
unfortunately that's amazing animal.
Unfortunately a lot of the,

1592
01:23:16,870 --> 01:23:19,750
um,
that the animals and New Zealand are

1593
01:23:19,751 --> 01:23:24,751
also in these high fence operations.
So like you'll go over there and

1594
01:23:26,460 --> 01:23:30,940
you know,
there'll be a few hundred acres or few

1595
01:23:30,940 --> 01:23:34,710
thousand acres depending on where you're
shot in Ireland,

1596
01:23:34,720 --> 01:23:38,380
elk,
these people chasing it down with their

1597
01:23:38,381 --> 01:23:40,930
shitty arrows.
The barely penetrate.

1598
01:23:41,050 --> 01:23:43,900
They,
they a backstrap backstrap yeah.

1599
01:23:43,901 --> 01:23:45,340
Look where they hit him.
I know.

1600
01:23:45,610 --> 01:23:47,830
Terrible pictures.
Even the drawing sucks.

1601
01:23:48,190 --> 01:23:50,370
They didn't even know how to do,
are treated with a drawing.

1602
01:23:50,410 --> 01:23:55,410
Just put it in the right spot.
You missed all the haters out there

1603
01:23:55,601 --> 01:23:59,240
about this hunt podcasts.
We historically,

1604
01:23:59,340 --> 01:24:02,320
and we thoroughly enjoyed our,
what we've been eating.

1605
01:24:02,650 --> 01:24:04,120
Oh yeah man.
God.

1606
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:07,420
So good.
And I made a few posts on the.

1607
01:24:08,650 --> 01:24:11,780
We've had,
we've had elk tender loins.

1608
01:24:11,900 --> 01:24:15,160
Um,
I've talked to you about hog hunting.

1609
01:24:15,220 --> 01:24:17,860
I'm a big advocate of.
I love shooting hawks.

1610
01:24:17,861 --> 01:24:20,000
I love shooting gators.
Um,

1611
01:24:20,020 --> 01:24:24,400
we had a ridiculously good pork shoulder
today.

1612
01:24:24,580 --> 01:24:27,490
Incredible.
Does your friend Preston made progress

1613
01:24:27,491 --> 01:24:31,150
and made it into my head?
How many hours did you cook it for?

1614
01:24:31,270 --> 01:24:33,770
Slow cooked and for 17 something

1615
01:24:33,870 --> 01:24:36,240
crazy.
I mean it was falling apart as you stick

1616
01:24:36,241 --> 01:24:38,310
a fork into it,
but yeah,

1617
01:24:38,311 --> 01:24:41,340
we uh,
we've been eating wild game.

1618
01:24:41,700 --> 01:24:46,260
Amazing wild game.
I think wild pig hunting is one thing

1619
01:24:46,261 --> 01:24:49,380
that almost everybody wants to do.
Like even bill burr,

1620
01:24:49,500 --> 01:24:52,560
my friend bill who's never expressed any
interest in hunting,

1621
01:24:52,710 --> 01:24:55,350
I give him elk whenever he comes and
does my podcast.

1622
01:24:55,480 --> 01:24:57,830
Like he came last week and I gave him a
bunch of,

1623
01:24:57,831 --> 01:24:59,890
uh,
elk and uh,

1624
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:01,380
he loves meat.
He eats meat.

1625
01:25:01,590 --> 01:25:02,341
He goes,
yeah,

1626
01:25:02,341 --> 01:25:03,990
I'd go wild pig hunting.
I go,

1627
01:25:03,991 --> 01:25:04,950
really?
He goes,

1628
01:25:04,951 --> 01:25:06,340
yeah,
you want to take me wild to on it?

1629
01:25:06,341 --> 01:25:07,081
I'll fuck.
Yeah,

1630
01:25:07,081 --> 01:25:07,980
dude,
let's do it.

1631
01:25:08,220 --> 01:25:10,530
So I'm going to take a pig hunting pigs.
Hunting is the one,

1632
01:25:10,531 --> 01:25:12,840
like even my agent.
My agent is the,

1633
01:25:12,930 --> 01:25:16,040
she's the nicest lady.
Shout out to stacy.

1634
01:25:16,260 --> 01:25:18,660
She's a sweetheart and she loves
animals.

1635
01:25:18,661 --> 01:25:20,520
She loves dogs.
She rescues dogs.

1636
01:25:20,521 --> 01:25:24,060
So I was cast and loves all animals and
when she finds out that I hunt,

1637
01:25:24,061 --> 01:25:25,800
she was like,
oh,

1638
01:25:26,130 --> 01:25:27,440
I don't know how I feel about that.
I go,

1639
01:25:27,450 --> 01:25:28,650
but you eat meat.
She goes,

1640
01:25:28,651 --> 01:25:29,820
I know.
She goes,

1641
01:25:29,821 --> 01:25:31,230
you should hunt pigs.
I go,

1642
01:25:31,231 --> 01:25:31,651
why?
She goes,

1643
01:25:31,651 --> 01:25:32,484
because they're ugly.

1644
01:25:33,140 --> 01:25:33,973
I'm like,
why?

1645
01:25:34,150 --> 01:25:36,660
That's what Sharon started out with
Sharon,

1646
01:25:36,920 --> 01:25:39,530
my wife is from England.
And then she started out.

1647
01:25:41,060 --> 01:25:44,690
She started out having no interest in
hunting yourself.

1648
01:25:44,750 --> 01:25:48,110
But then when she started to realize
just how many deer there were,

1649
01:25:48,850 --> 01:25:50,240
um,
she was like,

1650
01:25:51,560 --> 01:25:55,850
we like,
this is a necessity because for sure,

1651
01:25:55,851 --> 01:25:58,940
well,
and we're in Wisconsin at the time and

1652
01:25:58,941 --> 01:26:01,280
then she really wanted to do it.
But like you,

1653
01:26:01,281 --> 01:26:03,020
she said,
I don't want to go.

1654
01:26:03,350 --> 01:26:07,990
I know I'm totally proficient.
So she shot for a long time for learning

1655
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:09,350
the proper way.
Shot.

1656
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:12,140
And then she said,
you know,

1657
01:26:12,350 --> 01:26:17,350
from the hunting aspect,
I think if I'm gonna like actually hunt,

1658
01:26:18,080 --> 01:26:21,080
I think I want to start with something
like maybe ugly,

1659
01:26:21,110 --> 01:26:23,540
like a,
like a rush Russian hog or something

1660
01:26:23,541 --> 01:26:28,541
like a Russian boar because like those,
those bores are there.

1661
01:26:29,450 --> 01:26:33,500
They overrun certain parts of Florida,
like on the sod farmers,

1662
01:26:33,800 --> 01:26:37,520
we do a lot of hunting on sod farms and
um,

1663
01:26:38,170 --> 01:26:41,420
we're down there with Osceola outfitters
hoppy,

1664
01:26:41,421 --> 01:26:46,421
Kemper's name and it's,
it's amazing how good the pig hunting

1665
01:26:46,551 --> 01:26:49,940
is,
but it's also equally amazing how much

1666
01:26:49,941 --> 01:26:52,010
destruction they due to his place.

1667
01:26:52,500 --> 01:26:57,080
I mean,
he runs hunts 360 days a year and

1668
01:26:57,081 --> 01:27:02,081
there's people shooting them every
single day and they're still just tons.

1669
01:27:02,830 --> 01:27:04,510
It's crazy.
Well,

1670
01:27:05,080 --> 01:27:07,750
you,
when you talk about how they breed,

1671
01:27:08,020 --> 01:27:12,640
that's where it gets so shocking when
you find out that they can get to full

1672
01:27:12,641 --> 01:27:16,400
maturity in six months.
They have a litter and I believe they're

1673
01:27:16,420 --> 01:27:19,540
only pregnant for six weeks and then
they shit out.

1674
01:27:19,541 --> 01:27:22,750
The kids get out of there six months
later,

1675
01:27:22,930 --> 01:27:26,020
they're having kids of their own and
they could do that cycle.

1676
01:27:26,080 --> 01:27:29,860
I think three times a year and they can
have a ton.

1677
01:27:29,890 --> 01:27:33,820
I mean they could have a ton of babies
and they just keep multiplying over and

1678
01:27:33,821 --> 01:27:38,821
over and over and over again and in the
less someone comes along and shoot them,

1679
01:27:39,210 --> 01:27:43,150
there is not enough mountain lions in
the world to keep a cap on that.

1680
01:27:43,180 --> 01:27:44,800
They just,
they're not going to be able to do it.

1681
01:27:45,190 --> 01:27:48,610
Pigs are very smart too.
They're super smart.

1682
01:27:48,780 --> 01:27:50,770
They're super turned,
turned in,

1683
01:27:50,830 --> 01:27:53,950
turn tuned in.
Their eyesight sucks,

1684
01:27:54,100 --> 01:27:57,150
but their sense of smell is incredible.
Yeah.

1685
01:27:57,190 --> 01:27:58,450
Ridiculous.
Yeah.

1686
01:27:58,451 --> 01:28:02,140
They smell you a fucking mile away and
like see a dude and they just start

1687
01:28:02,141 --> 01:28:06,150
running header over the hill.
They do so much damage to fences to.

1688
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,760
I think someone told me something like
if,

1689
01:28:09,880 --> 01:28:11,030
if they can get it

1690
01:28:11,100 --> 01:28:16,100
their snout into something,
then they can get their whole body

1691
01:28:16,231 --> 01:28:18,420
through it.
Like they have that much will.

1692
01:28:19,020 --> 01:28:24,020
So if they can get the snout,
like into the fence or under the fence,

1693
01:28:24,120 --> 01:28:26,220
they will be through it.
Geez.

1694
01:28:26,460 --> 01:28:29,160
Yeah.
There they do some crazy far away.

1695
01:28:29,250 --> 01:28:30,240
They find a way.

1696
01:28:30,480 --> 01:28:33,120
Well,
there is so fucked up that is the only

1697
01:28:33,121 --> 01:28:36,630
animal in North America that allow you
to hunt from a helicopter with the

1698
01:28:36,631 --> 01:28:39,240
machine gun.
We're in Texas.

1699
01:28:39,241 --> 01:28:40,380
They're like,
go ahead.

1700
01:28:43,150 --> 01:28:46,530
That is so Texas.
We have a hard problem.

1701
01:28:46,531 --> 01:28:48,030
What should we do,
man?

1702
01:28:48,031 --> 01:28:51,090
You know what I've been thinking.
I've been thinking about helicopters,

1703
01:28:51,091 --> 01:28:53,280
man.
Helicopters and machine goes like,

1704
01:28:53,310 --> 01:28:54,540
what the fuck are you?
Who?

1705
01:28:54,700 --> 01:28:57,840
Who let this guy in the meeting?
Man,

1706
01:28:57,841 --> 01:29:01,200
we've got to curb these things.
I'm thinking nuclear weapons.

1707
01:29:01,230 --> 01:29:02,290
No,
no,

1708
01:29:02,310 --> 01:29:02,611
no,
no.

1709
01:29:02,611 --> 01:29:03,151
Okay.
Okay.

1710
01:29:03,151 --> 01:29:07,620
How about helicopter helicopters?
Helicopters and machine guns over

1711
01:29:07,621 --> 01:29:08,620
nuclear weapon.
All.

1712
01:29:08,640 --> 01:29:09,930
All grade.
Okay.

1713
01:29:09,960 --> 01:29:11,550
Next.
Next item on the agenda.

1714
01:29:11,790 --> 01:29:13,730
So they just.
They have this thing called Helen

1715
01:29:13,731 --> 01:29:16,500
hunters and there's an episode of
pigment.

1716
01:29:16,510 --> 01:29:20,100
There's a show called pigment and
pigment just goes around shooting pigs

1717
01:29:20,101 --> 01:29:22,380
all the time.
He got the name pig man and he lives in

1718
01:29:22,381 --> 01:29:24,420
Texas where again,
it has to be done.

1719
01:29:24,420 --> 01:29:29,420
Texas has Mu Eons of pigs.
They have so many pigs that Texas opened

1720
01:29:29,671 --> 01:29:31,920
up a new road.
I forget where the road was.

1721
01:29:32,040 --> 01:29:36,780
They opened up a new road and they had
40 car accidents the first night from

1722
01:29:36,781 --> 01:29:39,890
people slamming into pigs.
That's when you know you've got a fucked

1723
01:29:39,900 --> 01:29:41,970
up problem.
So when I told you,

1724
01:29:42,040 --> 01:29:42,873
oh,
go ahead.

1725
01:29:42,930 --> 01:29:46,920
This episode of Pigman,
it's called a pork lips now,

1726
01:29:47,310 --> 01:29:52,020
and a pork lips now is a Ted nugent,
had pigman you can watch on youtube.

1727
01:29:52,290 --> 01:29:57,290
They get into fucking helicopter and
they shoot 250 pigs in a day and they're

1728
01:29:58,381 --> 01:30:00,560
flying around and then just dark,
dark,

1729
01:30:00,570 --> 01:30:00,900
dark,
dark,

1730
01:30:00,900 --> 01:30:03,000
dark,
like a Goddamn platoon movie.

1731
01:30:03,650 --> 01:30:08,650
Detect that they're hitting these pigs
in the head as the pigs are running full

1732
01:30:09,031 --> 01:30:11,700
clip and the pigs are flipping head over
feet.

1733
01:30:11,940 --> 01:30:15,600
I mean it's fucked up and you know,
they're not eating those things.

1734
01:30:15,870 --> 01:30:17,520
Half of them,
they're just going to leave there.

1735
01:30:17,730 --> 01:30:20,220
No one cares.
They just have to do something.

1736
01:30:20,430 --> 01:30:25,430
Try to curb that population.
Now if you did that with lambs or josh

1737
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:29,040
or with deer,
you know,

1738
01:30:29,041 --> 01:30:31,830
or any,
any normal farm animal.

1739
01:30:32,040 --> 01:30:37,040
We have a hierarchy of animals that will
allow people to do that too.

1740
01:30:38,150 --> 01:30:42,030
Yeah,
it is funny that people have that

1741
01:30:42,990 --> 01:30:46,740
they've got that one thing,
whereas as soon as you start shooting a

1742
01:30:46,741 --> 01:30:50,340
deer,
they're not cool with it.

1743
01:30:50,550 --> 01:30:54,870
Or the big one is bears.
Bears are certainly the biggest.

1744
01:30:54,900 --> 01:30:56,100
That's the big one.
Yup.

1745
01:30:56,280 --> 01:30:57,510
But again,
mean bears.

1746
01:30:57,511 --> 01:31:00,630
It's the same thing if you go with the
rivets live up in Alberta,

1747
01:31:00,900 --> 01:31:03,030
man,
black bears are everywhere.

1748
01:31:03,060 --> 01:31:05,760
They have so many bears anywhere in
Canada.

1749
01:31:05,850 --> 01:31:07,740
They are,
there's a lot of them,

1750
01:31:07,830 --> 01:31:10,260
tons,
tons of barriers.

1751
01:31:10,290 --> 01:31:13,880
And the only thing stopping their
population growth is hunters.

1752
01:31:13,920 --> 01:31:15,000
Yup.
That's it.

1753
01:31:16,140 --> 01:31:16,830
But,
um,

1754
01:31:16,830 --> 01:31:19,930
so back to this apocalypse now thing,
the,

1755
01:31:19,931 --> 01:31:20,850
um,
the,

1756
01:31:20,920 --> 01:31:21,631
uh,
like I said,

1757
01:31:21,631 --> 01:31:23,560
the episodes are on twitter,
but if you need to just,

1758
01:31:23,910 --> 01:31:27,750
it gives you also a good source.
I don't think you'll ever get it unless

1759
01:31:27,751 --> 01:31:31,030
you see giant packs of pit.
What do they call?

1760
01:31:31,620 --> 01:31:34,140
What do they call know?
What do they call a pack of pigs?

1761
01:31:35,060 --> 01:31:38,850
I think pack a pig sounds pretty good.
You know what they call it?

1762
01:31:38,851 --> 01:31:40,080
Aborigines.
Um,

1763
01:31:40,580 --> 01:31:40,951
uh,
you know,

1764
01:31:40,951 --> 01:31:43,050
Adam Green tree,
our buddy from Australia,

1765
01:31:43,080 --> 01:31:48,080
he uh,
he owns a mining company or does dusting

1766
01:31:48,211 --> 01:31:49,980
company.
We does mining right,

1767
01:31:50,010 --> 01:31:52,920
is involved a lot of mining operations.
I don't know that part.

1768
01:31:52,980 --> 01:31:53,880
Okay.
But anyway,

1769
01:31:54,150 --> 01:31:54,711
he,
uh,

1770
01:31:54,711 --> 01:31:58,710
and he employs a bunch of aborigines and
so,

1771
01:31:58,711 --> 01:32:02,640
uh,
he got to know them really well and he

1772
01:32:02,650 --> 01:32:05,830
told me it's a fascinating,
fascinating stories about their culture

1773
01:32:05,831 --> 01:32:07,870
and their history.
It's really interesting stuff,

1774
01:32:07,871 --> 01:32:12,400
but one of the things,
as crazy as when you call a group,

1775
01:32:12,430 --> 01:32:14,650
you don't call them a tribe,
they call themselves a mob.

1776
01:32:16,060 --> 01:32:17,090
Is that just their term

1777
01:32:17,110 --> 01:32:18,580
analogy for it?
Yeah.

1778
01:32:18,650 --> 01:32:21,300
Terminology is a mob,
like an average.

1779
01:32:21,301 --> 01:32:24,430
The mob obviously it's just a different
meaning than the mob.

1780
01:32:24,440 --> 01:32:27,040
Yeah.
Not like the mob and the mafia,

1781
01:32:27,220 --> 01:32:28,990
like that's just a pack,
you know,

1782
01:32:29,030 --> 01:32:31,150
I'm a tribe,
a group,

1783
01:32:31,151 --> 01:32:32,410
a clan,
you know,

1784
01:32:32,411 --> 01:32:35,710
they call themselves a mob and he said
you will have,

1785
01:32:35,740 --> 01:32:40,500
they'll have one language and that they
speak and then 10 miles over there's

1786
01:32:40,510 --> 01:32:43,420
another group that has a totally
different language and they can't speak

1787
01:32:43,421 --> 01:32:44,254
each other's language.

1788
01:32:44,460 --> 01:32:47,760
Kinda like England is England,
like the dialects.

1789
01:32:48,390 --> 01:32:50,450
Oh,
but there's still an English.

1790
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:54,000
These people are not speaking in Africa.
It's like that too.

1791
01:32:54,001 --> 01:32:57,090
There's a lot of.
You go from tribe to tribe and it's

1792
01:32:57,240 --> 01:33:00,240
almost like a completely different.
Yeah,

1793
01:33:00,241 --> 01:33:02,420
different dialect.
Totally.

1794
01:33:02,710 --> 01:33:05,670
That's probably where the whole tower of
Babel story came from,

1795
01:33:05,671 --> 01:33:07,140
from the Bible.
You know,

1796
01:33:07,141 --> 01:33:11,520
back when there was not that much travel
when you had to ride a fucking horse to

1797
01:33:11,521 --> 01:33:13,350
get somewhere.
If you were lucky,

1798
01:33:13,351 --> 01:33:16,200
if you had one.
So it's probably if you,

1799
01:33:16,201 --> 01:33:18,840
once you crossed over a mountain range
or something like that,

1800
01:33:18,841 --> 01:33:22,170
those fuckers over there,
there was totally your language.

1801
01:33:22,240 --> 01:33:23,280
Yeah.
Like look at Europe,

1802
01:33:23,510 --> 01:33:25,770
you know,
you could just travel a short distance

1803
01:33:25,950 --> 01:33:28,110
and you're dealing with completely
different languages.

1804
01:33:28,111 --> 01:33:29,220
Totally different culture.

1805
01:33:29,740 --> 01:33:31,120
Well yeah,
it was in Sweden.

1806
01:33:31,420 --> 01:33:36,420
I'm doing some coaching with the
national team and you know,

1807
01:33:37,090 --> 01:33:41,560
you can be in Italy or you can be in
France or you can be Germany and no

1808
01:33:41,561 --> 01:33:43,700
time.
Yeah,

1809
01:33:43,730 --> 01:33:46,720
I mean it's completely different
culture.

1810
01:33:46,721 --> 01:33:49,330
Completely different language,
completely different people,

1811
01:33:49,331 --> 01:33:50,260
different food,

1812
01:33:50,430 --> 01:33:53,580
different history.
It's amazing and it's all smaller than a

1813
01:33:53,670 --> 01:33:55,620
segment of the United States and that's
with

1814
01:33:55,760 --> 01:33:56,960
vehicles.
Yeah.

1815
01:33:56,990 --> 01:33:59,820
So I mean,
imagine before,

1816
01:34:00,240 --> 01:34:02,270
before when you've been in some of the
mountains,

1817
01:34:02,271 --> 01:34:06,380
we have elk it in.
Would you really want to have to go two

1818
01:34:06,381 --> 01:34:11,180
or three mountain ranges over just
because if you had a cool little house

1819
01:34:11,181 --> 01:34:14,900
and some running water and a little
place to dump and.

1820
01:34:15,370 --> 01:34:16,780
Yeah,
all that stuff,

1821
01:34:16,781 --> 01:34:19,130
you'd be kind of happy right there.
Yeah.

1822
01:34:19,460 --> 01:34:21,050
Hey,
I think I'm just going to go walk over

1823
01:34:21,051 --> 01:34:23,720
here and risk hypothermia because they
don't have marina wool.

1824
01:34:23,721 --> 01:34:24,554
On

1825
01:34:25,500 --> 01:34:28,160
how,
how long did you travel for archery?

1826
01:34:29,670 --> 01:34:31,270
I did just,
I think,

1827
01:34:31,750 --> 01:34:36,140
I think I've done three passports.
Three full passports.

1828
01:34:36,150 --> 01:34:37,600
What?
With extensions?

1829
01:34:37,750 --> 01:34:40,180
One point $3.
Million Miles I've got flying.

1830
01:34:40,330 --> 01:34:43,870
Wow.
All shooting bows and shooting a bow.

1831
01:34:44,080 --> 01:34:47,170
You know what's crazy is um,
three years ago,

1832
01:34:48,060 --> 01:34:51,460
Shit,
Sharon and I went to inherit him.

1833
01:34:51,461 --> 01:34:56,461
Our son went to Mexico for vacation and
it was the first time I'd ever traveled

1834
01:35:00,561 --> 01:35:03,870
without a bookcase.
Well,

1835
01:35:04,260 --> 01:35:05,720
those Puerto Vallarta.
Yup.

1836
01:35:06,260 --> 01:35:08,780
That's crazy.
We were down there at the same time.

1837
01:35:08,920 --> 01:35:11,030
Yup.
That was the yeah,

1838
01:35:11,090 --> 01:35:14,090
no kid and that was weird.
I was literally getting,

1839
01:35:15,170 --> 01:35:17,570
I was getting on the plane to go home
and you were,

1840
01:35:17,890 --> 01:35:20,720
you were just getting there.
The same exact time.

1841
01:35:20,850 --> 01:35:23,270
Fucking love Puerto Vallarta.
Oh,

1842
01:35:24,020 --> 01:35:27,080
so awesome.
Going Back Jack Spot.

1843
01:35:27,440 --> 01:35:29,060
It's a good spot,
right?

1844
01:35:29,061 --> 01:35:31,330
When this ruts done,
I'm going to.

1845
01:35:31,550 --> 01:35:34,700
Here's what's going to happen.
I'm going to be sitting in a tree for 13

1846
01:35:34,701 --> 01:35:39,701
hours a day for about another 21 days
and when that's done,

1847
01:35:40,490 --> 01:35:42,860
I'm going to sleep for about three days.

1848
01:35:42,920 --> 01:35:47,920
I'm going to shave this space and I'm
going to sling some onnit kettlebells

1849
01:35:48,351 --> 01:35:52,370
around like three or four hours a day.
Get a beach body.

1850
01:35:52,680 --> 01:35:53,790
Yup.
And I'm going to get,

1851
01:35:54,200 --> 01:35:57,890
I'm going to get my pv body going,
but uh,

1852
01:35:58,230 --> 01:35:59,690
no.
Since I met you,

1853
01:35:59,780 --> 01:36:04,780
you got me hooked on it and it's totally
changed me because when I did

1854
01:36:06,950 --> 01:36:10,910
in September,
well I started hunting in October 24th,

1855
01:36:11,120 --> 01:36:12,680
August,
24th is when I start.

1856
01:36:12,681 --> 01:36:17,510
I start in Alberta and then I worked my
way through several states and a lot of

1857
01:36:17,511 --> 01:36:22,511
different tags,
but I went 30 days with all I ate was

1858
01:36:23,301 --> 01:36:27,200
one meal a day idea meal at night.
But um,

1859
01:36:27,950 --> 01:36:31,410
I lived off the tpc packs.
I've,

1860
01:36:31,411 --> 01:36:34,910
I've packed them all in a big one gallon
Ziploc bag.

1861
01:36:35,420 --> 01:36:38,750
I do it the tpc packs for morning and
evening.

1862
01:36:39,310 --> 01:36:42,230
Um,
I would do three Alpha brains that I'd

1863
01:36:42,231 --> 01:36:44,780
put in three different bottles of water
throughout the day.

1864
01:36:45,410 --> 01:36:46,243
One of the,
um,

1865
01:36:46,340 --> 01:36:50,180
total gut house.
And then I would do two of the Omega

1866
01:36:50,181 --> 01:36:55,181
bars and to have the tonka bars and I
lived off that for 30 days.

1867
01:36:55,430 --> 01:36:58,940
That's all you and I.
and I was at for dinner too.

1868
01:36:59,030 --> 01:37:01,970
That was your dinner?
I would normally cook some kind of a

1869
01:37:01,971 --> 01:37:05,180
dinner at night.
But that was what you were eating during

1870
01:37:05,181 --> 01:37:06,014
the day?
Yup.

1871
01:37:06,200 --> 01:37:08,030
Why did you limit yourself to so little
food?

1872
01:37:08,060 --> 01:37:10,190
Because I was always in my backpack.
Oh.

1873
01:37:10,380 --> 01:37:13,640
And it was like super portable is easy
to travel with.

1874
01:37:13,880 --> 01:37:16,700
So you were,
you were doing the hardcore backpack on

1875
01:37:16,701 --> 01:37:17,630
thing?
Not,

1876
01:37:17,690 --> 01:37:19,910
I mean,
it wasn't truly hardcore,

1877
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,540
it was just,
if,

1878
01:37:22,580 --> 01:37:26,750
I think if you're hunting,
I like to try to get as much rest as I

1879
01:37:26,751 --> 01:37:31,340
can because if you shoot something and
you're up all night and then a lot of

1880
01:37:31,341 --> 01:37:34,460
these places I have multiple tags so I'm
right back at it the next day.

1881
01:37:34,880 --> 01:37:37,280
Like in Alberta,
I was there,

1882
01:37:38,150 --> 01:37:43,150
I think I was there nine days and I
think I did 87 miles on my little Garmin

1883
01:37:43,490 --> 01:37:47,480
is what I covered on our feet.
So,

1884
01:37:47,600 --> 01:37:49,430
um,
it's,

1885
01:37:50,210 --> 01:37:53,090
you burn a lot of calories and then,
you know,

1886
01:37:53,450 --> 01:37:57,360
obviously Montana is way more rugged
than Alberta.

1887
01:37:57,460 --> 01:38:00,300
I mean it was some of that stuff.
I Bet I was,

1888
01:38:00,900 --> 01:38:05,160
I did half the distance but I feel like
I was probably having to put twice the

1889
01:38:05,161 --> 01:38:07,410
effort in,
but it was,

1890
01:38:08,130 --> 01:38:11,550
it totally sustained me when that would,
you know,

1891
01:38:11,551 --> 01:38:14,420
that's pretty hard beating on you,
you know,

1892
01:38:14,430 --> 01:38:19,430
just living off out of a backpack.
Really Limited sleep and being in

1893
01:38:19,801 --> 01:38:22,200
different places.
I wish I would've had that when I

1894
01:38:22,201 --> 01:38:23,034
competed.

1895
01:38:23,610 --> 01:38:26,820
Well,
keeping those neurotransmitters at good

1896
01:38:26,821 --> 01:38:31,200
levels is so important.
It's one of the reasons why if I fly

1897
01:38:31,201 --> 01:38:34,740
somewhere and I land,
I do two things,

1898
01:38:34,890 --> 01:38:36,770
two things like right away,
one,

1899
01:38:36,840 --> 01:38:38,520
unless I get there at night and I'm
tired,

1900
01:38:38,521 --> 01:38:41,400
I just go to sleep,
but one of the first things I do is I do

1901
01:38:41,401 --> 01:38:44,790
a 30 minute workout.
It doesn't even have to kill yourself.

1902
01:38:45,180 --> 01:38:46,100
I just,
I,

1903
01:38:46,120 --> 01:38:50,610
I a minimum of 30 minutes.
I like to go to the gym and just get

1904
01:38:50,611 --> 01:38:53,010
everything going.
Just fire up those engines,

1905
01:38:53,011 --> 01:38:55,680
blow out those pipes,
get that blood flowing,

1906
01:38:55,710 --> 01:38:58,050
and if I don't do that,
I don't feel as good.

1907
01:38:58,051 --> 01:39:01,710
It takes me a day or two to adjust,
but if I do do that and then I have a

1908
01:39:01,711 --> 01:39:05,850
nice salad or a healthy meal afterwards,
I feel great.

1909
01:39:06,270 --> 01:39:10,950
The other thing is Alpha brain,
it's so important to me to get those,

1910
01:39:11,310 --> 01:39:15,930
those levels of your neurotransmitters
high because it's one of the things that

1911
01:39:15,931 --> 01:39:18,660
affects you the most about jet lag and
travel.

1912
01:39:19,180 --> 01:39:22,920
Your sleep patterns off and your brain
chemistry is all funky.

1913
01:39:23,250 --> 01:39:27,480
I take new mood and I take Alpha brain,
new moods,

1914
01:39:27,481 --> 01:39:29,550
great,
but Alpha brain is imperative.

1915
01:39:29,580 --> 01:39:32,700
I have to take it,
if I do a UFC,

1916
01:39:32,701 --> 01:39:34,170
I have to take it,
you know,

1917
01:39:34,290 --> 01:39:37,910
anytime where my mind has to be fired up
for long time

1918
01:39:37,930 --> 01:39:40,980
periods of time.
I do notice a difference with it and I

1919
01:39:40,990 --> 01:39:43,330
like the peach one that you put in with
water.

1920
01:39:44,140 --> 01:39:46,210
Um,
because I,

1921
01:39:46,330 --> 01:39:49,990
I probably,
I don't enjoy drinking water but I drink

1922
01:39:50,020 --> 01:39:54,580
a lot throughout the day.
So having a few of those that I can do

1923
01:39:54,581 --> 01:39:57,640
throughout the day with some flavoring.
Yeah,

1924
01:39:57,660 --> 01:40:00,310
tastes good if it doesn't make sure.
Yeah.

1925
01:40:00,630 --> 01:40:03,220
See I like a little taste,
but I don't like sugar.

1926
01:40:03,310 --> 01:40:06,640
Sugar would put me off if I tasted it,
but yeah,

1927
01:40:06,641 --> 01:40:10,270
they've been awesome.
And the new moods I normally take for

1928
01:40:10,271 --> 01:40:15,271
those at night with that tpc Apac and I
get to fuck with your dreams.

1929
01:40:17,350 --> 01:40:21,520
I love it.
I get into some crazy dream modes.

1930
01:40:22,380 --> 01:40:27,180
Alpha brain does that to Alpha brain
gives me these wolves on lucid dreams.

1931
01:40:27,290 --> 01:40:29,320
That's what you told me.
So I'm like on.

1932
01:40:29,440 --> 01:40:31,760
I do a tpc night.
I did.

1933
01:40:31,790 --> 01:40:32,630
Well,
I do.

1934
01:40:32,631 --> 01:40:35,660
I had a tpc nyt now.
I'll take for new moods,

1935
01:40:35,900 --> 01:40:39,380
but then I'll have one of my alfred
brains if I'm at home is when they go to

1936
01:40:39,381 --> 01:40:41,940
bed.
I like to.

1937
01:40:41,941 --> 01:40:46,010
I like to dream because then I at least
feel like I'm getting true deep sleep.

1938
01:40:46,490 --> 01:40:48,290
It sounds like you're having adventures,

1939
01:40:48,790 --> 01:40:53,770
like if you've taken that much,
me having you must be on magical mystery

1940
01:40:53,771 --> 01:40:58,560
tour is every night
a magical mystery tour.

1941
01:40:59,050 --> 01:41:00,470
Yeah.
It's a,

1942
01:41:00,810 --> 01:41:01,660
you know,
I'm glad.

1943
01:41:01,690 --> 01:41:04,570
I'm glad you got into that.
I'm glad you also,

1944
01:41:04,571 --> 01:41:06,070
uh,
I know you did a lot of work with some

1945
01:41:06,071 --> 01:41:11,071
of those guys down to onnit academy and
you learned a lot of shoulder mobility

1946
01:41:11,321 --> 01:41:15,910
exercises and shoulder strengthening
exercises that I think can be really

1947
01:41:15,911 --> 01:41:17,560
critical for archers.
You know,

1948
01:41:17,650 --> 01:41:22,650
archery is a,
as much as it is about technique and

1949
01:41:22,721 --> 01:41:25,960
it's,
as much as it is about proper form and

1950
01:41:26,230 --> 01:41:29,120
proper execution,
there's also muscle involved.

1951
01:41:29,140 --> 01:41:31,150
There's also strength involved.
Any.

1952
01:41:31,180 --> 01:41:35,350
Obviously it's an athletic endeavor.
You're dealing with your body and um,

1953
01:41:35,380 --> 01:41:39,880
I think it's really cool that you're
developing like a program of specific

1954
01:41:39,881 --> 01:41:42,970
things that you feel would benefit
archers,

1955
01:41:42,971 --> 01:41:45,910
give them shoulder stability,
range of motion.

1956
01:41:46,240 --> 01:41:48,070
Um,
I know we did some of them yesterday

1957
01:41:48,071 --> 01:41:52,690
with the club bells,
which I find really beneficial for a lot

1958
01:41:52,691 --> 01:41:53,810
of things.
Um,

1959
01:41:53,950 --> 01:41:58,150
club bells and I'm.
One of the things I like about them is

1960
01:41:58,151 --> 01:42:00,920
that they,
they're really awkward with.

1961
01:42:01,030 --> 01:42:02,290
It's a,
what it is,

1962
01:42:02,380 --> 01:42:03,850
it's,
it's exactly what it sounds like.

1963
01:42:03,851 --> 01:42:05,860
It's a club.
It's an iron club.

1964
01:42:06,070 --> 01:42:10,840
So this is long handle and then there's
a lot of mass at the top of the handle

1965
01:42:10,841 --> 01:42:11,674
and it's

1966
01:42:12,070 --> 01:42:16,780
baseball bat made out of cast iron is
Dang near what it would be a good

1967
01:42:16,781 --> 01:42:17,614
description.

1968
01:42:17,760 --> 01:42:19,890
Yeah.
And I have some longer heavier ones at

1969
01:42:19,891 --> 01:42:20,930
home,
um,

1970
01:42:21,010 --> 01:42:24,060
that I've really gotten into it.
Say when I say heavier,

1971
01:42:24,061 --> 01:42:27,210
I'm only talking about 35 pounds.
That's all you need.

1972
01:42:27,270 --> 01:42:28,740
I mean,
you don't need that much would.

1973
01:42:28,950 --> 01:42:31,590
We're doing these exercises called
shield casts.

1974
01:42:31,620 --> 01:42:35,970
It's so difficult to do,
to take a 35 pound club with all the

1975
01:42:35,971 --> 01:42:39,570
weight at the end of it,
so it's weird leverage and then control

1976
01:42:39,571 --> 01:42:41,940
it,
swinging it over the top of your head

1977
01:42:41,941 --> 01:42:44,700
and then bringing it down with full
control.

1978
01:42:44,701 --> 01:42:48,600
That pausing it in front of you.
I think that's incredible for archery

1979
01:42:48,810 --> 01:42:53,220
and I think it would be incredibly
beneficial for stability of your front

1980
01:42:53,221 --> 01:42:58,221
arm and having the strength to be able
to hold your front arm there without any

1981
01:42:58,411 --> 01:43:00,890
strain or any like shaking or weird.

1982
01:43:01,300 --> 01:43:03,820
Yeah,
just skip your scapula.

1983
01:43:03,880 --> 01:43:08,880
Stability is a is a huge weakness point
in archery when archers breakdown,

1984
01:43:10,810 --> 01:43:15,810
it's normally because of super weak
scapular stability muscles and there's a

1985
01:43:18,941 --> 01:43:21,600
lot of different movements that they
taught me at the Ana,

1986
01:43:21,630 --> 01:43:24,370
the cat,
because I really wanted to go there to

1987
01:43:24,430 --> 01:43:27,280
one.
I think since you showed me some of the

1988
01:43:27,281 --> 01:43:29,500
first moves you showed me,
just kettlebells.

1989
01:43:30,010 --> 01:43:35,010
I realize this is stuff that.
This is stuff I'd use every day.

1990
01:43:35,620 --> 01:43:38,620
I mean,
you've been here four days.

1991
01:43:38,680 --> 01:43:43,680
How often am I picking up that felt by
putting in the back of my truck and you

1992
01:43:44,410 --> 01:43:45,400
know,
picking up

1993
01:43:46,900 --> 01:43:49,600
and feed sacks or whatever.
I mean,

1994
01:43:49,630 --> 01:43:54,630
that's like true useful strength and
mobility and flexibility and so all of

1995
01:43:57,250 --> 01:44:00,410
these movements teaches that and I
really wanted something that,

1996
01:44:00,860 --> 01:44:04,010
um,
one thing I learned to appreciate when I

1997
01:44:04,011 --> 01:44:09,011
lived in England was Sharon for a long
time was you don't have some people just

1998
01:44:10,431 --> 01:44:15,330
don't have the space to have very much
workout equipment with kettlebells.

1999
01:44:15,530 --> 01:44:18,140
And some teams,
like some of the teams I work with,

2000
01:44:18,141 --> 01:44:20,000
especially with some of the smaller
countries,

2001
01:44:20,390 --> 01:44:25,130
they don't have huge budgets,
but with kettlebells they can,

2002
01:44:25,460 --> 01:44:30,460
that's a minimal investment and it's a
minimal space usage to you can take two

2003
01:44:32,481 --> 01:44:37,070
kettlebells and keep them in a corner.
It's not like you got the total gym with

2004
01:44:37,071 --> 01:44:38,030
Chuck Norris,
you know,

2005
01:44:38,180 --> 01:44:40,550
hiding in the corner and it's wasted a
bunch of space.

2006
01:44:41,060 --> 01:44:46,010
And I really wanted to go on one,
learn proper technique and learn

2007
01:44:46,011 --> 01:44:48,470
different movements and then realize,
okay,

2008
01:44:48,471 --> 01:44:53,180
which ones actually work good for
archery or what ones can help archers.

2009
01:44:53,240 --> 01:44:58,240
And my plan was originally we were going
to do some videos.

2010
01:44:59,450 --> 01:45:03,650
I'm with those guys on an academy
specific for some archers.

2011
01:45:04,100 --> 01:45:08,030
Um,
but this hunting season has,

2012
01:45:08,120 --> 01:45:10,280
I've been so busy,
I mean,

2013
01:45:11,330 --> 01:45:13,520
and even right now I'd like to be able
to go,

2014
01:45:13,521 --> 01:45:18,020
but I'm,
I'm in no way having time just because

2015
01:45:18,021 --> 01:45:23,021
I'm trying to get my hunt stone trying
to finish the TV show and do all that

2016
01:45:23,121 --> 01:45:26,210
stuff and
time.

2017
01:45:26,210 --> 01:45:29,090
But it is on the schedule because I
think so many people are going to

2018
01:45:29,091 --> 01:45:33,620
benefit from learning super simple
movements that really increase your

2019
01:45:33,621 --> 01:45:36,110
range.
Like that steel mace I liked just

2020
01:45:36,111 --> 01:45:40,760
because of how much range teach you all
the way around,

2021
01:45:40,860 --> 01:45:45,710
know you're getting so much range in
that shoulder joint and you're really

2022
01:45:45,711 --> 01:45:48,950
having to focus on that scapular
stability all the way around.

2023
01:45:49,220 --> 01:45:51,860
And then you even when he come around to
the front,

2024
01:45:52,030 --> 01:45:53,750
you know,
even though it doesn't look like you're

2025
01:45:53,751 --> 01:45:55,460
doing much,
if you're doing it properly,

2026
01:45:55,790 --> 01:46:00,200
you're really engaging your core to seed
everything down and then bring

2027
01:46:00,201 --> 01:46:04,250
everything to center.
And so much of being stable as an archer

2028
01:46:04,280 --> 01:46:08,270
is having a solid platform and a solid
base.

2029
01:46:08,630 --> 01:46:13,340
And that core stability is what we're
all that radiates from.

2030
01:46:13,400 --> 01:46:16,700
If the core is,
is loose or unstable,

2031
01:46:16,701 --> 01:46:20,450
then obviously everything outside of
that is going to be the same way.

2032
01:46:20,720 --> 01:46:22,340
Yeah.
And especially when you consider when

2033
01:46:22,341 --> 01:46:24,170
you do archery,
you're pulling with

2034
01:46:24,170 --> 01:46:29,170
your back and your scapula and involved
in the drawing of the bow and also in

2035
01:46:30,351 --> 01:46:32,510
the making the boat release,
the,

2036
01:46:32,520 --> 01:46:36,470
the executing the shot.
Another extra a exercise that I think is

2037
01:46:36,471 --> 01:46:39,770
critical for archers is chin ups.
And I think that um,

2038
01:46:39,860 --> 01:46:43,490
if it's like,
if I could say one piece of equipment,

2039
01:46:43,520 --> 01:46:45,080
if you could,
it could only afford one.

2040
01:46:45,380 --> 01:46:48,350
Get a chin up bar.
I think chin up bars are giant and

2041
01:46:48,360 --> 01:46:51,120
especially a good one that actually
comes off the wall.

2042
01:46:51,121 --> 01:46:52,590
Look,
if you can invest in one,

2043
01:46:52,591 --> 01:46:54,890
you have the space and you just,
you know,

2044
01:46:54,960 --> 01:46:57,480
get it mounted on some studs in your
house.

2045
01:46:57,750 --> 01:46:59,370
It's so critical,
I think.

2046
01:47:01,090 --> 01:47:02,190
Yes,
the hangs.

2047
01:47:02,200 --> 01:47:03,360
What I was going to say,
first of all,

2048
01:47:03,361 --> 01:47:08,361
hangs are so good for your shoulders.
And there's a bunch of articles and

2049
01:47:09,541 --> 01:47:12,000
videos,
watch the videos on youtube by some

2050
01:47:12,030 --> 01:47:12,863
doctors.

2051
01:47:13,110 --> 01:47:15,330
I was first turned onto this by Steve
Maxwell.

2052
01:47:15,331 --> 01:47:17,460
He told me about this.
There was a doctor,

2053
01:47:17,461 --> 01:47:18,680
this particular doctor,
I've,

2054
01:47:18,780 --> 01:47:19,591
sorry,
I forget his name,

2055
01:47:19,591 --> 01:47:20,970
but I'm sure you could find it really
quickly.

2056
01:47:21,350 --> 01:47:24,840
Uh,
and he invented this method of hanging

2057
01:47:25,050 --> 01:47:29,880
and releasing tension and pressure in
the shoulder joint because he thinks

2058
01:47:29,881 --> 01:47:34,020
that a lot of the pain that people
suffer from impacted shoulders is really

2059
01:47:34,021 --> 01:47:38,130
just a function of our,
our bodies are designed.

2060
01:47:38,340 --> 01:47:43,260
We have essentially like ancient primate
genetics and ancient primate structure.

2061
01:47:43,470 --> 01:47:46,500
And then one thing primates,
almost all of them have in common is

2062
01:47:46,501 --> 01:47:50,040
they swing from things by their arms.
They hang by their arms,

2063
01:47:50,041 --> 01:47:53,220
they swing by their arms and that
pulling and stretching,

2064
01:47:53,430 --> 01:47:57,450
stretching and lengthening of the,
those,

2065
01:47:57,670 --> 01:48:02,670
that soft tissue in those tendons,
that's imperative to both stay the

2066
01:48:02,880 --> 01:48:06,210
stability of the shoulder and the
alleviation of pain in the range of

2067
01:48:06,211 --> 01:48:07,044
motion.
I've,

2068
01:48:07,220 --> 01:48:11,100
I've experienced some really great
results with hanging from my shoulders

2069
01:48:11,310 --> 01:48:13,200
and also from something that I learned
from you,

2070
01:48:13,470 --> 01:48:18,300
which is hanging from a chin up bar and
then with my arms completely extended,

2071
01:48:18,630 --> 01:48:23,610
just contracting the Scapula,
so just contract and then I'll hold that

2072
01:48:23,611 --> 01:48:26,260
for as long as I can and then I'll
release it yet.

2073
01:48:26,430 --> 01:48:28,530
Yeah.
So you're almost hanging to the point

2074
01:48:28,531 --> 01:48:32,810
where you let your shoulders fully
extend where he,

2075
01:48:32,811 --> 01:48:33,690
you know,
you feel like,

2076
01:48:33,720 --> 01:48:36,510
you know,
you feel like you're on the verge of

2077
01:48:37,290 --> 01:48:39,370
letting go of something if you're
hanging.

2078
01:48:39,960 --> 01:48:44,670
But then in that same position you
literally take your shoulder sockets and

2079
01:48:44,671 --> 01:48:48,930
almost pull them down to your armpits.
So without bending your arms.

2080
01:48:48,960 --> 01:48:50,430
Yeah.
You don't bend your arms,

2081
01:48:50,431 --> 01:48:53,730
you're not using any bicep.
There's a video of John doing it online

2082
01:48:53,731 --> 01:48:55,170
too.
If you could find that,

2083
01:48:55,400 --> 01:48:57,060
would it.
Do you remember the name of your video?

2084
01:48:57,330 --> 01:48:59,160
I Dunno,
it was right after I had shoulder

2085
01:48:59,161 --> 01:49:02,310
surgery,
so I know that I wasn't able to do it

2086
01:49:02,311 --> 01:49:05,670
really well,
which was kind of the point I think,

2087
01:49:06,360 --> 01:49:07,740
you know,
I was having to,

2088
01:49:07,800 --> 01:49:10,900
I just came out of the shoulder surgery
so I was trying to,

2089
01:49:11,370 --> 01:49:16,370
to rebuild that string.
I'm trying to see here,

2090
01:49:19,980 --> 01:49:22,710
but there's a ton of exercises you can
do.

2091
01:49:23,020 --> 01:49:26,790
You can afford for perfect form in front
bolts,

2092
01:49:26,900 --> 01:49:29,280
both shoulder,
so knock on archery,

2093
01:49:29,640 --> 01:49:33,630
the knock on our tree youtube channel,
but it's the if you want to look at it,

2094
01:49:33,631 --> 01:49:34,440
and by the way,
that's all.

2095
01:49:34,440 --> 01:49:34,830
So also

2096
01:49:34,830 --> 01:49:38,070
an awesome channel for instruction.
You want to learn some stuff about

2097
01:49:38,071 --> 01:49:43,071
archery and I think that might be one of
the things I'd seen from you before ever

2098
01:49:43,711 --> 01:49:48,580
met you two is a bunch of little
instructional videos that you had put

2099
01:49:48,581 --> 01:49:53,140
out on the proper way to use releases on
a bunch of different things.

2100
01:49:54,180 --> 01:49:55,810
That's what I did.
I teach.

2101
01:49:56,170 --> 01:49:58,960
That's what he does.
Folks teach stuff.

2102
01:49:59,150 --> 01:50:00,700
And uh,
I know that sounds crazy,

2103
01:50:00,701 --> 01:50:01,900
but we're going to end this podcast.

2104
01:50:02,150 --> 01:50:03,140
Dude.
It's only an hour.

2105
01:50:03,141 --> 01:50:04,490
Forty five minutes.
Dude,

2106
01:50:04,491 --> 01:50:05,810
you only did one podcast.

2107
01:50:06,110 --> 01:50:07,850
Listen,
I'll be back.

2108
01:50:07,880 --> 01:50:10,820
Just relax.
If we tag out tomorrow,

2109
01:50:10,940 --> 01:50:12,920
maybe John and I will do a fight
companion.

2110
01:50:12,960 --> 01:50:14,090
Who,
how about that?

2111
01:50:14,091 --> 01:50:15,790
Yeah,
fucks a.

2112
01:50:17,510 --> 01:50:18,970
that's a,
that's a big F.

2113
01:50:19,040 --> 01:50:21,950
I mean,
who knows if we tag out and um,

2114
01:50:22,130 --> 01:50:23,630
so this one I'm going to,
uh,

2115
01:50:23,631 --> 01:50:28,160
I'll email this to young jamie and
hopefully he'll get this up pronto and

2116
01:50:28,161 --> 01:50:29,690
uh,
you guys will get it tomorrow.

2117
01:50:29,870 --> 01:50:32,450
So that's it for now.
Um,

2118
01:50:32,630 --> 01:50:37,630
you can check out John's instagram page.
It's knock on TV,

2119
01:50:38,360 --> 01:50:40,130
uh,
the youtube channels,

2120
01:50:40,150 --> 01:50:43,610

2122

There you go,

2123
01:50:49,131 --> 01:50:51,230
ladies and gentlemen,
and if you're interested,

2124
01:50:51,260 --> 01:50:51,771
you're like,
man,

2125
01:50:51,771 --> 01:50:53,660
I need a hobby.
Pickup our tree,

2126
01:50:53,790 --> 01:50:58,010
goddammit.
And I wished it was a place near me that

2127
01:50:58,011 --> 01:51:00,050
was a,
a place that taught,

2128
01:51:00,440 --> 01:51:00,980
you know,
it's,

2129
01:51:00,980 --> 01:51:01,610
it's hard.

2130
01:51:01,610 --> 01:51:04,730
It's hard to find a good archery school.
And,

2131
01:51:04,731 --> 01:51:07,580
uh,
I mean we were talking about that today

2132
01:51:07,760 --> 01:51:10,870
about what archery clubs or like in
England or in,

2133
01:51:10,871 --> 01:51:13,250
um,
in Europe is that they're like country

2134
01:51:13,251 --> 01:51:18,170
clubs where people go and like the way
people go to play golf,

2135
01:51:18,171 --> 01:51:21,870
people go to do archery and you know,
they appreciate it as an,

2136
01:51:22,040 --> 01:51:23,360
a discipline.
Yeah.

2137
01:51:23,361 --> 01:51:28,361
They have memberships and full bars in
there and beautiful facility.

2138
01:51:29,421 --> 01:51:30,780
Yeah,
all kinds of cool,

2139
01:51:30,781 --> 01:51:32,130
cool stuff.
Yeah,

2140
01:51:32,150 --> 01:51:33,320
for sure.
Anyway,

2141
01:51:33,680 --> 01:51:38,180
we're exhausted folks.
We've been doing nothing but waiting all

2142
01:51:38,181 --> 01:51:42,830

little rnr here.

2143

minutes,

2144
01:51:47,180 --> 01:51:49,010

Unless they're sagging,

2145
01:51:49,070 --> 01:51:52,610
it must have now.
Tomorrow we gotta drop the Hammer.
