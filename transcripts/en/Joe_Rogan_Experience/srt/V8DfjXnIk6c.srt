1
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:04,120
Five,
four,

2
00:00:04,121 --> 00:00:05,020
three,
two,

3
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:06,850
one.
Welcome Courtney.

4
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:09,340
Thank you.
First of all,

5
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:11,770
how did you do what you did and how are 
you?

6
00:00:11,771 --> 00:00:13,570
Right now?
We're just jumping right in.

7
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:18,780
Let's just jump right in.
For people who are just tuning into 

8
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:21,450
courtney one the Moab to 40,
which is a 238 mile endurance race 

9
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:25,960
through the MOAB,
Utah

10
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:27,520
Deserts.
Kenyans,

11
00:00:27,521 --> 00:00:28,450
mountains.

12
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:30,940
And how long did it take you to run?
Two hundred and 30.

13
00:00:30,941 --> 00:00:33,850
Eight miles.
Took just under 58 hours.

14
00:00:33,851 --> 00:00:38,851
That is so crazy.
And you beat the second place person by 

15
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:42,520
more than 20 miles,
right?

16
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:44,290
What was the distance?
I'm not sure.

17
00:00:44,291 --> 00:00:46,510
The distance.
I think it was around 20 or so.

18
00:00:46,511 --> 00:00:49,360
It was about 10 hours.
How did you do that?

19
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:54,040
How this is and your.
How old are you?

20
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:56,840
Thirty two.
That's young for these kinds of races,

21
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:58,990
right?
Be True because these kinds of races,

22
00:00:58,991 --> 00:01:02,890
usually it's like grit and anger at the 
world that gets you through.

23
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:08,270
You're only 32.
You're young and you.

24
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:12,760
The way you're winning is like so crazy 
and you've only been doing this like big

25
00:01:12,761 --> 00:01:15,340
time races like this for a short amount 
of time.

26
00:01:15,341 --> 00:01:16,000
Correct?
Yeah,

27
00:01:16,001 --> 00:01:16,990
that's right.
How long?

28
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:21,090
Running ultra marathons for?
Maybe seven,

29
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:26,180
eight years,
but I'm getting pretty competitive in 

30
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:26,180
the past couple of years.

31
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:29,940
Wow.
So how did you start out the race?

32
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:33,610
You start off running in high school?
Yeah,

33
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,570
back in junior high,
high school.

34
00:01:35,571 --> 00:01:40,571
I ran cross country and track and 
continued in during sports through 

35
00:01:40,731 --> 00:01:45,731
college and tried some marathons and 
then it was just like a natural segue 

36
00:01:45,731 --> 00:01:47,000
into trail racing,

37
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:50,180
but it's just the way you're beating 
these people's insane.

38
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,970
Not just beating them.
You're like demoralizing people.

39
00:01:57,010 --> 00:01:59,300
Oh,
you're too nice when you read the second

40
00:01:59,301 --> 00:02:03,740
place person by 20 hours or 20 miles.
That's so crazy.

41
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,290
Ten hours.
You said it was about 10 hours.

42
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:08,900
That is insane.
You're both start at the same time.

43
00:02:08,901 --> 00:02:09,290
Ready,
set,

44
00:02:09,291 --> 00:02:11,900
go.
You're finishing 10 hours ahead.

45
00:02:11,901 --> 00:02:14,090
Like you could go,
go to sleep,

46
00:02:14,091 --> 00:02:16,340
get eight hours sleep,
have a nice meal,

47
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:19,610
like sit down and,
and then just,

48
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,920
just show up,
clean and showered and everything like 

49
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:24,920
that.
Oh,

50
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:25,460
you're finishing now.
How cute.

51
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:30,760
I just slept all night.
That's crazy.

52
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:32,300
Yeah,
it was,

53
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,010
it was cool.
I mean it was a cool thing.

54
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:39,060
Venture to,
to travel with your feet for 238 miles 

55
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:41,440
was.
I mean it was brand new territory for me

56
00:02:41,441 --> 00:02:43,390
so I didn't know how it was going to go.

57
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,390
Pretty much brand new territory for all 
the runners.

58
00:02:45,391 --> 00:02:47,670
Right?
This is like the first ever 2:40

59
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:48,210
PM,
2:40.

60
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:48,750
Quite a few.

61
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:51,340
Tom had done a bunch of 200 mile races.

62
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:53,410
There you go.
It's a picture.

63
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:56,450
You hoofing it.
Hoefling crazy.

64
00:02:56,630 --> 00:03:01,630
So what is going on?
Why are you so better than everybody 

65
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:01,630
else?

66
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,990
Um,
I think I,

67
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:05,980
I had a good day out.

68
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:11,350
Get out of here.
Three days such as you try to be too 

69
00:03:12,181 --> 00:03:12,980
nice.
No,

70
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:13,680
but,
but,

71
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:18,830
but I really like objectively,
like how are you so much better than 

72
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:18,830
everybody else?

73
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:23,240
I don't,
I don't know that I'm physically better 

74
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:23,240
than any of them,
but I,

75
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:26,950
um,
have been really trying to learn how to 

76
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:30,070
tap into my brain when it physically 
becomes hard because I think our brain 

77
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:33,560
can help us overcome so much and it's so
powerful.

78
00:03:33,561 --> 00:03:36,620
So I'm kind of that mind over matter 
thing and,

79
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:42,280
and when it physically becomes 
impossible to try and switch gears into 

80
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:45,710
like have it be a mental thing and just 
keep pushing.

81
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:51,120
So what are you doing to do that?
Like have you studied some forms of 

82
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:51,850
meditation or.

83
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:57,100
No,
I think just experience like I keep on 

84
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:00,701
doing these races that put me in 
uncomfortable physical states and um,

85
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:05,180
and then I,
I try and keep in mind that my brain can

86
00:04:05,181 --> 00:04:09,290
help me overcome this physical pain if I
just keep going.

87
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:10,400
What?
So that's it,

88
00:04:10,401 --> 00:04:13,100
just just stay tough.
Trial and error.

89
00:04:13,101 --> 00:04:13,610
Yeah.

90
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:18,840
Wow.
So essentially self taught in terms of 

91
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:18,840
like your mental fortitude

92
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:19,320
kind of.
Yeah,

93
00:04:19,321 --> 00:04:22,050
I guess probably could give some of that
credit.

94
00:04:22,051 --> 00:04:24,970
So like my parents or my upbringing or 
you know,

95
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:26,940
coaches I've had along the way.
Um,

96
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:30,450
but in these,
in this past couple of years,

97
00:04:30,451 --> 00:04:35,340
it's been just like not letting myself 
have an excuse to stop.

98
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:40,590
Well,
that's terrifying to everybody else 

99
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:42,130
because if you did decide to start like 
learning meditation or something,

100
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:43,970
what if like it took you to another 
level?

101
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:47,950
How do you meditate?
Yeah.

102
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,350
You want to do that?
Ah,

103
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,200
I don't know because I can't do what you
do.

104
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:56,670
I can tell you.
I mean maybe it's just being comfortable

105
00:04:56,780 --> 00:05:01,780
with that excruciating agony and pain 
and just like finding a,

106
00:05:02,021 --> 00:05:05,030
a state of mind that you obviously know 
how to achieve.

107
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:08,870
Maybe there's nothing more to it.
Maybe it's just incredibly hard work.

108
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:11,780
And just grit,
which you obviously have bolded those.

109
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:13,520
I mean that could be just,
it.

110
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:15,800
You might have the form.
Yeah.

111
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:17,690
I mean a lot of times people try to 
overthink things,

112
00:05:17,691 --> 00:05:20,180
right?
Like how many people do you know,

113
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:25,360
where their life sort of never changes,
but they're always like doing self help 

114
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,430
seminars and reading all these books and
fucking nothing changes.

115
00:05:27,431 --> 00:05:29,090
It's,
they're just a safe person.

116
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:34,330
They keep screwing up,
they keep getting involved in bad 

117
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:34,330
relationships.
And you know,

118
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:38,540
sometimes maybe it's just there's a 
simpler thing or simpler answer,

119
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:40,810
right?
Set your mind to something,

120
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:46,170
put in the work to get there and then 
just execute the plan now is just the 

121
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:48,160
furthest I've ever run.
That is the furthest.

122
00:05:48,161 --> 00:05:50,080
Yeah.
What was the previous furthest?

123
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:55,710
Um,
the previous furthest was 155 ish miles.

124
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,040
Wow.
That's a big difference.

125
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:59,630
Yeah.
Wow.

126
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:02,870
And that was just on a flat track.
Oh Wow.

127
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,540
So this was really different than what I
had done before.

128
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:07,310
Well,
that's the interesting thing about these

129
00:06:07,311 --> 00:06:12,311
mountain races like,
cause it's not just a in terms of it's 

130
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:17,830
not just your cardiovascular endurance,
you have to have muscular endurance 

131
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:18,920
because you're climbing.
There's a lot of elevation change,

132
00:06:18,921 --> 00:06:19,510
right?
Yeah,

133
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:24,700
quite a bit.
It's nice though because then you get 

134
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,921
the reprieve of using different muscles.
You're hiking muscles might be different

135
00:06:27,471 --> 00:06:30,500
than like your flat running or your 
downhill muscles.

136
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:35,860
So you get to kind of switch it around,
switch the effort around in why is 

137
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:36,920
everybody in this race using trekking 
poles?

138
00:06:36,921 --> 00:06:40,790
I noticed that for me,
they were helpful.

139
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:45,050
I didn't use them until the,
the last quarter of the race,

140
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:50,580
um,
and they were helpful just as my feet 

141
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:50,980
were becoming a little more tender and 
um,

142
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:56,050
my muscles not quite as quick to catch 
me on the downhills and the uphill is 

143
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:58,550
just to like dispersed the effort a 
little bit to my arms.

144
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:01,180
Well Jamie,
pull up that video of the,

145
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:02,780
what the,
you know,

146
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:07,790
the sort of preview video of the mob to 
40 when they showed all these people 

147
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:10,871
running over the top.
There's some precarious section and when

148
00:07:10,971 --> 00:07:13,730
you're tired you've already run like 80,
90 miles.

149
00:07:13,731 --> 00:07:16,100
Then you hit these crazy precarious 
sections.

150
00:07:16,101 --> 00:07:18,380
Like what does that look like?
Don't die.

151
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:24,640
And no one's there watching you.
It's not like running with other 

152
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:24,640
runners,
right?

153
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:28,880
Like this would be a lonely death.
No of 200 endurance run as two and 38 

154
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,520
mile foot race through some of Utah's 
most stunning and challenging terrain.

155
00:07:31,521 --> 00:07:36,521
And it really is so beautiful.
And so Solomon is the sponsor of this.

156
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:39,400
They're the presenting sponsor.
Um,

157
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,470
and then there's a bunch of like sub 
sponsor.

158
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,530
I loved their trail shoes.
Look at this section.

159
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:45,850
That is insane.
This is the one that drives me nuts.

160
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:48,460
It's like if you just stumble off the 
side,

161
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:49,070
that's a wrap.

162
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,440
Yeah.
Well,

163
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:53,120
and they're making it look like so easy 
to run down.

164
00:07:53,121 --> 00:07:58,121
I'm pretty sure I was like stumbling my 
way down that a lot less gracefully.

165
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:04,310
Well,
how come these guys can't do it the way 

166
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:06,111
you do it though?
Like something's going on because like 

167
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:09,900
this is kind of be like insane too for 
the other people that were running it,

168
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:12,420
that you win by these giant margins.

169
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,350
Yeah.
I don't know.

170
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:17,830
I think you really don't know you.
What is your

171
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:20,000
diet like?
Oh yeah,

172
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:22,340
I'm Nachos.

173
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:26,630
Nachos.

174
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,510
I mean just a normal diet.
I don't restrict or like try and include

175
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:38,340
anything different than the normal.
I guess the average American.

176
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,120
Wow.

177
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:43,130
Um,
so do you supplement with vitamins or do

178
00:08:43,131 --> 00:08:44,600
you take anything else?

179
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,990
Uh,
I take a multivitamin.

180
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:48,040
That's it.
Yeah.

181
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,540
Wow.
No minerals,

182
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:50,750
nothing critical.
Creatine.

183
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:51,940
Nothing crazy.
No,

184
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:52,810
no,
no.

185
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:56,940
So just essentially a multivitamin and 
hoofing it with Nachos in your belly.

186
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:04,460
That's crazy.
Like I would expect that someone who is 

187
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,660
so far ahead of the rest of the pack 
that you would have some,

188
00:09:06,661 --> 00:09:10,530
like you go to Colorado Springs Olympic 
training program and they get you hooked

189
00:09:10,531 --> 00:09:13,890
up to these rocky four machines.
Like they had drago the Russian guy,

190
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:17,850
you're doing all this stuff and they got
like a music video soundtrack playing in

191
00:09:17,851 --> 00:09:22,851
the background.
I mean,

192
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:25,800
that's what I would think.
But meanwhile you're just drinking beer,

193
00:09:25,801 --> 00:09:27,150
eating Nachos.
Yeah.

194
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:30,860
Does it help live in Colorado?
Like you're,

195
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:32,120
you're at a good altitude,
right?

196
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:33,380
Yeah.
Great altitude.

197
00:09:33,381 --> 00:09:34,940
I think it probably helps.
I mean,

198
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:38,990
I'm right outside Denver so there's 
trails out my door.

199
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:40,160
So I,
that's my,

200
00:09:40,161 --> 00:09:45,161
like everyday run is on trails climate 
around the foothills of Colorado.

201
00:09:45,261 --> 00:09:47,490
So quite a bit of climbing.
Um,

202
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:51,410
we're already at altitude so it's gotta.
It's gotta help.

203
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:55,580
So talk me through your preparation.
So when did it start?

204
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:57,980
Like when,
when did you sign up for this race?

205
00:09:57,981 --> 00:09:59,600
When did you know that you're going to 
do it?

206
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,370
I signed up in May,
um,

207
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:08,490
but I also was signed up for a 100 mile 
race a month prior to Moab in,

208
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,450
so like mid September,
um,

209
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:16,480
and so my preparation was mostly for 
that hundred mile race and then after 

210
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:19,630
the hundred miler it was just trying to 
recover,

211
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:25,020
um,
make sure my legs and body felt fresh 

212
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:27,241
again and then got squeezed in a couple 
more weeks of solid training to get 

213
00:10:27,241 --> 00:10:27,370
ready for Moab.

214
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:29,430
It's so funny because you say 100 miles 
wide,

215
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:34,550
they ain't shit.
It's all relative because a marathon to 

216
00:10:36,391 --> 00:10:41,391
me would kill me.
But I mean you saying that you read 238 

217
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:45,180
miles and then a hundred mile,
it doesn't sound like much child's play.

218
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,570
How long does it take you to run a 
hundred miles?

219
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:54,160
I'm usually somewhere around 24 hours or
under depending on the trail and the 

220
00:10:54,741 --> 00:10:55,670
climbing and stuff.

221
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,500
So when you're getting ready.
So you,

222
00:10:57,501 --> 00:11:01,080
so you're preparing mostly for the 100 
mile race and then it sort of recovery.

223
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:05,190
And then did the 100 mile race 
essentially get you in condition for the

224
00:11:05,191 --> 00:11:05,820
2:40?

225
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,850
What I hoped is that it can be a good 
springboard to the next one.

226
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:10,850
So,
um,

227
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:14,430
is that condition,
is that a mental thing or are we talking

228
00:11:14,431 --> 00:11:16,140
about a physical thing and a mental 
thing?

229
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:18,300
I think both.
Yeah,

230
00:11:18,301 --> 00:11:20,400
your body.
I mean your body is important.

231
00:11:20,401 --> 00:11:22,740
So like the physical aspect is important
as well.

232
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:28,020
Um,
and just being able to like pound your 

233
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,370
legs for the,
the amount of time,

234
00:11:29,371 --> 00:11:33,630
the amount of miles that you need to for
these races is physically learned.

235
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:37,120
So what kind of daily miles were you 
putting in when you're getting ready for

236
00:11:37,121 --> 00:11:37,700
the 100?

237
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,810
I would average about 100 miles per 
week.

238
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:45,860
So I don't know.
So that's not even too crazy.

239
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,030
That's not too crazy.

240
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:52,600
Right?
Because my friend campaigns was trying 

241
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:52,600
to do a marathon a day.
Yeah,

242
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,920
he seems insane.
That's so cool.

243
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,900
Is that too much?
I mean,

244
00:11:55,901 --> 00:11:57,880
no,
he was doing great with it.

245
00:11:57,881 --> 00:11:58,270
So

246
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:03,270
keenan and a day later than you,
you're like,

247
00:12:03,271 --> 00:12:03,990
yeah,
keep it up.

248
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:07,290
You know what you should do like 40 
miles a day buddy.

249
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,300
It depends on people's bodies.
Like some,

250
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:16,420
some people 100 miles per week is a lot 
of their bodies can't sustain that and 

251
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:19,330
for some like campaigns he can do a 
marathon a day and,

252
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:21,950
and be in great physical form for it.

253
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:24,310
But he's a meathead and I always wonder,
I love him,

254
00:12:24,311 --> 00:12:28,390
but I say this with all due respect,
I wonder if like he pushes too hard.

255
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:33,420
Like maybe there's like a fine line 
between there's like a point of 

256
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:37,891
diminishing return perhaps know where 
you go so hard that you're kind of 

257
00:12:37,891 --> 00:12:42,181
overtraining and even though you can 
sustain it really you get better 

258
00:12:42,181 --> 00:12:44,170
performance out of being like a pushing 
left.

259
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:45,810
Yeah.
I don't know.

260
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:47,810
I can't speak to,
to his training,

261
00:12:47,811 --> 00:12:49,820
but um,
I think he's pretty.

262
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:52,070
He's pretty new to all these ultras as 
well.

263
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:53,240
Yeah,
I think so.

264
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,400
Over the last few years he did the big 
foot.

265
00:12:55,401 --> 00:12:59,990
200 last year is 205 miles.
He did that in [inaudible] 78 hours.

266
00:12:59,991 --> 00:13:03,740
He actually did this race two hours 
quicker than you did the 205,

267
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:05,470
which is so cool.
Crazy.

268
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:08,090
Probably because he's just humiliated by
you.

269
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:14,300
She beat me by a day,
so like,

270
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:19,360
forget about the second place person who
you could have taken a nice restful 

271
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,230
eight hours sleep,
gotten a fine meal at a restaurant,

272
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:26,000
had a glass of wine and took a shower,
brushed your teeth,

273
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:29,640
painted your toenails if you have any 
left.

274
00:13:29,641 --> 00:13:31,040
Did they all fall off?
No.

275
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:35,940
Still got 10 cams all fall off there.
He takes pictures of taped up,

276
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:39,470
like really disgusting.
So when you,

277
00:13:39,471 --> 00:13:44,471
um,
when you're recovering from something 

278
00:13:44,471 --> 00:13:46,661
like this,
how long does it take before you feel 

279
00:13:46,661 --> 00:13:46,661
normal again?

280
00:13:46,661 --> 00:13:48,830
Um,
after this one I felt like a human.

281
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:53,920
So I finished Sunday night and I felt 
human by Wednesday probably.

282
00:13:56,460 --> 00:14:01,040
And got out for some jobs then like 
Friday,

283
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:01,040
Saturday.

284
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,200
Really?
Yeah.

285
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:06,300
Wow.
I would be done with jogging forever for

286
00:14:06,301 --> 00:14:08,200
this.
This is so stupid.

287
00:14:08,201 --> 00:14:10,170
I just take a car next time.
What?

288
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:14,860
So like when you say you felt like a 
human again?

289
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:15,970
Like what do you mean by that?

290
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:22,180
For me,
those first couple of nights after I 

291
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:23,921
don't sleep very well.
I think like everything is just on 

292
00:14:23,921 --> 00:14:27,161
overdrive.
My legs are throbbing and uncomfortable 

293
00:14:27,161 --> 00:14:29,270
and um,
it's hard to turn your brain off as much

294
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:34,270
as you want to.
So I was finally like getting good 

295
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:37,841
normal sleep by Wednesday and it Kinda 
messed with my appetite for a couple of 

296
00:14:37,841 --> 00:14:39,920
days as well where food just like 
wasn't.

297
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:45,040
It didn't sound that great.
Even though I was like totally depleted 

298
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:45,040
of nutrition.
Yeah.

299
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:47,960
It's got to be such a shock for your 
body.

300
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:49,610
Oh for sure.
Who knows?

301
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:51,380
That's probably not good for,
but

302
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:53,040
you can't be.
Well,

303
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:56,570
I say it can't be,
but maybe you can be right because maybe

304
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:01,600
you're recovering and maybe when you 
recover from that extreme exertion your 

305
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:07,001
vitality ups because like there's all 
these people that say like,

306
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:09,450
I've read this,
that if you take them out,

307
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:12,530
if you'd run a marathon,
you should take six months off.

308
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:14,930
I've read that.
I actually read that.

309
00:15:14,931 --> 00:15:19,931
Like someone's recommendation and it 
takes you six months to recover from 

310
00:15:19,931 --> 00:15:19,931
marathon marathon.
Well,

311
00:15:19,931 --> 00:15:20,580
who?
Who You fat?

312
00:15:20,581 --> 00:15:23,420
So really talking about who is saying 
this.

313
00:15:23,421 --> 00:15:25,370
Like obviously there's people that can 
do more than you,

314
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:30,660
like people,
people who are writing this stuff down 

315
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:30,660
or silly because.
No,

316
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:31,880
because cam can,
if he can run a marathon a day,

317
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:36,910
obviously he doesn't need six months off
and I've hung out with him after he's 

318
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:39,911
done this and he's totally normal.
Like it doesn't seem like there's 

319
00:15:39,911 --> 00:15:39,911
anything wrong with them.

320
00:15:39,911 --> 00:15:43,360
So that's not true.
So the question is like who are we 

321
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:47,441
comparing to it?
Like who is our baseline is our 

322
00:15:47,441 --> 00:15:49,751
baseline,
like a guy who barely works out or as 

323
00:15:49,751 --> 00:15:50,720
our baseline you cause you're gonna get 
two radically different results.

324
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:53,840
Kind of take those articles with a grain
of salt.

325
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:55,430
Yeah,
well that's the thing.

326
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:57,170
What I was saying to Kim,
I was like,

327
00:15:57,171 --> 00:15:58,910
well how do you know how much to train?
He goes,

328
00:15:58,911 --> 00:16:03,911
no one knows how much to train for this 
stuff because it's really just 

329
00:16:03,911 --> 00:16:04,310
guesswork,
which is part of the cool part,

330
00:16:04,311 --> 00:16:09,311
you know,
it's like there's a million pieces to 

331
00:16:09,311 --> 00:16:12,020
the puzzle of ultra running and,
and figuring them out is part of the fun

332
00:16:12,021 --> 00:16:17,021
of doing this sport now.
What has it been like for you after you 

333
00:16:17,021 --> 00:16:17,840
won?
Because you're a,

334
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:23,260
like I,
I've talked to so many people that 

335
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:26,050
really have no interest normally in 
endurance running and they've brought 

336
00:16:26,091 --> 00:16:27,080
you up constantly.

337
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:30,420
Like you're like a superstar.
It says,

338
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:33,170
I'm sure it sounds crazy to you,
but like,

339
00:16:33,171 --> 00:16:34,700
uh,
my friend Brian Stevens,

340
00:16:34,701 --> 00:16:39,701
he was texting me the whole way back and
forth while this was going on and you 

341
00:16:39,701 --> 00:16:43,511
know,
he was like looking at your numbers and 

342
00:16:43,511 --> 00:16:43,511
your times.
He's like,

343
00:16:43,511 --> 00:16:43,760
this is fucking insane.
Like this woman is insane.

344
00:16:43,761 --> 00:16:44,960
Like,
how is she doing this?

345
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:45,960
Well,
thank you.

346
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:48,200
They had a good tracking system that 
was.

347
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:50,580
So.
Yeah,

348
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:51,860
that's what Brian was saying.
He's like,

349
00:16:51,861 --> 00:16:56,861
I've never been less productive.
I'm just going online and checking this 

350
00:16:56,861 --> 00:16:58,010
thing constantly.
Um,

351
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:03,250
yeah.
I mean since then I had to create a 

352
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:04,340
twitter,
didn't have any social media,

353
00:17:04,341 --> 00:17:06,170
instagram,
facebook,

354
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,210
but I love you.
That's how you were successful.

355
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:14,040
You weren't bogged down by all the 
nonsense that people just know and 

356
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,620
social media nonsense could eat up a lot
of your dad.

357
00:17:16,090 --> 00:17:19,070
I'm still figuring it out.
So don't bother.

358
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:22,040
Just occasionally post things and just 
ignore everything else.

359
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:28,870
I'll just retweet it via.
That's just learning about that little 

360
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:29,810
retreat,
but whenever they is.

361
00:17:29,811 --> 00:17:31,010
Interesting.
That's a good move.

362
00:17:31,011 --> 00:17:34,140
Yeah.
So like when you,

363
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:39,170
when you finished the race,
like what is the feeling like when you 

364
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:41,240
crossed the line and you look back and 
you don't even see a person like you,

365
00:17:41,241 --> 00:17:46,241
you wouldn't be able to see them with 
fucking binoculars like they are on the 

366
00:17:46,241 --> 00:17:47,510
other side of the earth.
Like the curve of the earth.

367
00:17:47,511 --> 00:17:49,740
If you believe that the curve of the 
earth

368
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:54,450
is literally so far like they,
they are beyond the curve.

369
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,010
That's true,
right?

370
00:17:56,190 --> 00:18:01,190
Isn't it?
Twenty miles I would imagine you can't 

371
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:04,401
see straight 20 miles.
I would imagine 20 miles you might be 

372
00:18:04,401 --> 00:18:05,280
able to see like the top of dudes head 
and he's like,

373
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:11,480
you'd have to have one of them crazy by 
knows those your glass and you can 

374
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:11,480
probably see him.
But yeah,

375
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:16,191
if you're glassing glassing,
I mean what is that feeling like?

376
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:18,900
It felt amazing,
you know,

377
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:22,000
with the tracking system that we had.
Um,

378
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:27,530
when I left the last aid station,
there's like 17 miles to go and it was 

379
00:18:27,931 --> 00:18:32,931
pretty much um,
we could see that it was certain that I 

380
00:18:33,601 --> 00:18:38,601
could get to the line first as long as I
didn't like take a nap out there or 

381
00:18:38,601 --> 00:18:42,000
become like physically incapable,
which you could take a nap.

382
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:42,870
That was the thing.

383
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:45,900
You can take a nice one.
Just think about that.

384
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:49,430
Let me just take a nice nap here.
Oh,

385
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:50,790
nice.
Five hour nap.

386
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,150
And you still have like five plus hours 
ahead of everybody.

387
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,880
Oh yeah,
that'd be nice.

388
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,740
Also,
it was nice because we could,

389
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:00,680
I was running with my husband at that 
point.

390
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:05,700
We could enjoy the trail and like not be
like super anxious about trying to be 

391
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:10,740
really efficient but just try and be 
efficient on the course.

392
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:15,690
But then we saw that getting under 58 
hours was possible.

393
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:18,930
So then I got a little bee in my bonnet 
about,

394
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:21,810
about trying to push the pace a little 
bit more.

395
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:26,160
I've never really been a great phrase,
oh you should come to Minnesota.

396
00:19:26,161 --> 00:19:31,161
We've got all sorts of good graces.
So does your husband run the same kind 

397
00:19:31,161 --> 00:19:33,960
of races that you run or did he just 
like hop in every now and then?

398
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:37,540
Um,
he runs 50 milers and 50 k's,

399
00:19:37,541 --> 00:19:39,810
so 31 miles.
But he didn't enter this race.

400
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:40,590
No,
he didn't.

401
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:43,530
He just kind of helped you along,
jumped in certain spots.

402
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:48,620
So how does he get these spots?
You have to drive all relaxed and if you

403
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:53,390
picture a 238 mile loop,
he,

404
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:56,660
he had to drive to all of the places on 
this course.

405
00:19:56,680 --> 00:20:01,680
So maybe he spent the day in the car the
couple of days in the car and I had a 

406
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,840
um,
a fantastic crew of friends out there.

407
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:07,470
And in these races you can have pacers 
for certain sections.

408
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:10,690
So I could have a buddy run with me,
um,

409
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:14,130
who was fresh and like their brain and 
their eyes and their legs were.

410
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:17,760
I'm more alert to help me just keep 
track of the course.

411
00:20:17,761 --> 00:20:21,360
Flags like staying on course and stuff 
like that.

412
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:26,840
That's interesting.
Like when you're doing this for this 

413
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:26,840
amount of hours,
what was the total hours again?

414
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:31,760
Fifty rate under 58.
So when you're doing it for this amount 

415
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:31,860
of hours,
how much sleep are you getting?

416
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:34,830
Um,
I slept 21 minutes.

417
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:42,000
Wow.
That is so crazy.

418
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:48,380
That was two separate naps.
So like 10 and 10 and 11.

419
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:54,610
Really the one minute nap and it was 
amazing.

420
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:58,540
The best sleep I've ever had.
Was it really?

421
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,150
It really was.
Well just why did you get up though?

422
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:01,900
After a minute?

423
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:07,080
Um,
so I did the 20 minute nap 

424
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:07,960
intentionally.
I crawled in the back of our crew car.

425
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:13,090
We had a sleeping bag back there and I 
tried to get some good rest after it was

426
00:21:13,091 --> 00:21:17,050
like middle of the second night and I 
didn't sleep very well.

427
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:22,430
Um,
I was just really uncomfortable and 

428
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:25,860
yeah,
and I was still like pretty amped up so 

429
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:27,250
I couldn't shut my brain off even though
it was like becoming pretty delirious.

430
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:32,580
I'm.
So then I left that aid station after 

431
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:35,641
laying in the car for 20 minutes and I 
was on the trail with one of my good 

432
00:21:35,641 --> 00:21:39,571
friends and Pacers and I was falling 
asleep as I was running like Zig zagging

433
00:21:39,581 --> 00:21:42,700
all over the trail.
I couldn't keep my eyes open.

434
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:48,120
So at one point I was bent over and I 
was like phase planning towards the 

435
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:48,880
ground and he's like,
just laid down,

436
00:21:48,881 --> 00:21:51,460
like take a nap right here,
right on the trail.

437
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:56,640
Um,
so I'm like laying down already snoring 

438
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:56,640
as I'm like one minute,
just one minute,

439
00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:01,090
wakes me up one minute later and I was 
like more alert than I've ever been.

440
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:04,130
And then we were super pumped up the 
rest of the time because we were like,

441
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:05,390
oh,
one minute nap.

442
00:22:05,391 --> 00:22:10,391
It was,
that's the craziest thing I've ever 

443
00:22:10,391 --> 00:22:10,880
heard in my life.
A bunch of people like,

444
00:22:10,881 --> 00:22:12,800
um,
I talked to Cam,

445
00:22:12,801 --> 00:22:17,801
I think he took us similarly,
like really short nap and it just like 

446
00:22:17,801 --> 00:22:20,450
rejuvenate's you in a weird way.
I've,

447
00:22:20,451 --> 00:22:23,060
I've heard that before.
The like if you're really tired,

448
00:22:23,061 --> 00:22:25,380
a 20 minute nap will make a huge 
difference.

449
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:27,800
If you could just lie down and I've 
always ignored that.

450
00:22:27,801 --> 00:22:30,320
Like how is that gonna be better next 
time?

451
00:22:30,321 --> 00:22:34,340
Try just one minute.
I'm lazy.

452
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:39,510
I would.
I would stay asleep when he woke you up 

453
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:39,860
after one minute.
Will you like,

454
00:22:39,861 --> 00:22:41,510
why'd you wake me up?
No,

455
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:43,700
I was like,
why'd you let me sleep so long?

456
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:49,130
It had been.
I thought it had been at least 30 

457
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:49,130
minutes and I was like,
dude,

458
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:51,170
we gotta go,
why'd you let me sleep so long?

459
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:55,010
It was like that was one minute one 
whole minute ready go.

460
00:22:55,011 --> 00:22:58,970
And you were just out cold was cold.
I rem cycle like dreams and everything.

461
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:01,160
I remember them.
I don't,

462
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,050
but I.
It was like the deepest sleep.

463
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:08,460
Wow.
And what was cool is as I was laying on 

464
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:12,010
the trail for one minute,
it was dark and beautiful stars out and 

465
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:13,810
there were elk bugling like up on the 
hill.

466
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:18,470
So it was cool that I didn't.
I didn't hallucinate that that was real.

467
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:21,980
You hallucinate at all.
I just had some hallucinations.

468
00:23:21,981 --> 00:23:23,270
Yeah.
What would you see?

469
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:25,550
You know,
in the forest at night,

470
00:23:25,551 --> 00:23:30,551
everything just becomes something.
So there were tons of like faces and 

471
00:23:30,551 --> 00:23:33,380
animals.
There was a guy playing a cello.

472
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:38,690
Um,
there was a leopard hanging out in a 

473
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:38,690
hammock.

474
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:42,820
Vivid are these,
I mean pretty like where I think they're

475
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:47,840
real and I'm like waving at them.
You're waving at the Leopard in the 

476
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:47,840
Hammock?
Well,

477
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,790
I didn't wave to him.
I waved to the cello player.

478
00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:55,090
Really?
But did you know he wasn't real as you 

479
00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:55,090
were running by?
Yeah,

480
00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:57,530
I mean now that I've done these quite a 
few times in the night,

481
00:23:57,740 --> 00:24:02,660
I usually see some things and so now 
it's just like Kinda cool to acknowledge

482
00:24:02,661 --> 00:24:04,520
that it's happening and try and 
remember.

483
00:24:04,521 --> 00:24:07,940
So I can tell my,
tell my friends afterwards.

484
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,580
So is there any part of you that thinks 
like,

485
00:24:10,581 --> 00:24:13,070
hey,
there's a guy with a cello in the woods,

486
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:14,920
or is there

487
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:20,340
just a recognition that you're freaking 
out because you're running 58 miles or 

488
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:20,340
58 hours?

489
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,470
I think just a recognition like,
Huh,

490
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:23,820
guy with cello.

491
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:30,770
So you're just so focused on what you're
doing that even the most bizarre thing,

492
00:24:30,771 --> 00:24:32,000
like a leopard in a hammock.

493
00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:33,130
Yeah.
I mean,

494
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:36,790
it just happens now,
so I know there's not actually one,

495
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:39,110
but how often does this take place?
I mean,

496
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,370
how many of these have you done these 
ultra marathons?

497
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:48,060
I'm quite a few.
And did they start the hallucinations 

498
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:48,690
started in the early ones?
Yeah,

499
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:53,730
basically like my first couple of 
hundred milers where you go through the 

500
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:57,630
night.
It's always the nighttime where the 

501
00:24:57,630 --> 00:24:57,630
shadows just like play tricks on you.
Um,

502
00:24:57,630 --> 00:25:01,960
and so I'm like in the mountains of 
Colorado and there's giraffes and like 

503
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:06,511
flying eels and all sorts of weird 
things and at first I was freaked out 

504
00:25:06,511 --> 00:25:07,410
about it.
Um,

505
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:09,490
but now it's just like,
all right,

506
00:25:09,491 --> 00:25:12,070
that'll be a fun story to tell 
afterwards.

507
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:14,850
Have you talked to a doctor or anyone 
and say,

508
00:25:14,851 --> 00:25:17,100
hey,
what happens to the mind when.

509
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,360
No,
I haven't.

510
00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:20,850
I'd be fascinated to know,
like what is,

511
00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:26,090
what's happening that's causing you to 
have these like extreme visual 

512
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:28,710
hallucinations because you're saying 
they looked real.

513
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Yeah.
But I think it's just like shadows and 

514
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,481
your brain is too tired to like process,
so it just jumbles them together into 

515
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:40,310
something that would make sense.
Wow.

516
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:43,040
I don't know,
but it's not freaking you out.

517
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:43,980
You're just like,
all right,

518
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:45,500
cello guy.
Hey Man.

519
00:25:45,501 --> 00:25:46,420
Rock on dude.
Yeah,

520
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:50,060
thanks for the tunes.
Could you hear him?

521
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:55,880
No.
So he was just like silent including a 

522
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:55,880
child,
which is creepy.

523
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:55,880
It itself.

524
00:25:56,390 --> 00:26:01,390
Wow.
Is that the only hallucinations or was 

525
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:01,390
there anything else weird

526
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:03,140
during this one?
Um,

527
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:06,200
those were like the significant ones.
Otherwise,

528
00:26:06,201 --> 00:26:10,760
just a lot of like random faces on trees
or rocks and stuff like that.

529
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:11,480
Now

530
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:14,780
as you're running right and you're 
running for 50 whatever,

531
00:26:14,781 --> 00:26:19,781
miles or 58 hours and you're constantly 
moving forward because you're a point in

532
00:26:20,271 --> 00:26:25,271
time where your body like,
like what does it feel like de you look 

533
00:26:25,771 --> 00:26:29,120
in constant pain or are you just numb to
it?

534
00:26:29,121 --> 00:26:30,110
Like what happens?

535
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:31,980
Um,
it's Kinda,

536
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:37,030
you go in waves,
like you'll be riding this wave where 

537
00:26:37,051 --> 00:26:42,051
you're just feeling like amazing and 
really fresh and like your legs can 

538
00:26:42,051 --> 00:26:44,100
cruise pretty well and nothing

539
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:44,700
hurts.
You know,

540
00:26:44,701 --> 00:26:49,701
everything's feeling really good and 
then that wave will eventually come 

541
00:26:49,701 --> 00:26:51,150
crashing down where things are hurting 
again.

542
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:54,330
And then you might be like whimpering 
along for a little bit,

543
00:26:54,331 --> 00:26:57,420
but the cool part about these is that 
those waves,

544
00:26:57,421 --> 00:26:58,380
like,
I mean,

545
00:26:58,381 --> 00:27:00,840
they always come and then they,
they go.

546
00:27:00,841 --> 00:27:03,390
So you ride this like high and low the 
whole race.

547
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:06,000
Um,
and when it gets really low,

548
00:27:06,001 --> 00:27:11,001
when you're feeling awful,
you just have to remember that you're 

549
00:27:11,001 --> 00:27:13,470
going to feel better again soon.
You just got to keep chugging along.

550
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:18,620
So you're in pain and then somehow or 
another you feel better even though you 

551
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:18,620
don't stop running.
Yeah.

552
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:19,830
Yeah.
How does it work?

553
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:22,530
I don't know,
like a switch flips or um,

554
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:27,560
sometimes I'll like intentionally during
those lows take more calories in 

555
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:31,500
thinking maybe that will help.
Just like give my body some something to

556
00:27:31,501 --> 00:27:34,170
burn for awhile to make it happy again.

557
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:36,270
What kind of stuff can you eat while 
you're running this much?

558
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:41,480
I'm in one this length.
I was doing a lot of um,

559
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:46,610
like water gatorade and then there's 
this powder you can put in water called 

560
00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:50,370
tailwind.
It has electrolytes and 200 calories per

561
00:27:50,371 --> 00:27:55,371
bottle.
So you're getting in calories and then 

562
00:27:55,371 --> 00:27:58,320
like normal athletic foods like honey 
stinger products,

563
00:27:58,350 --> 00:28:03,350
which are like gels and shoes and stuff.
But then I was eating boatloads of the 

564
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:08,820
Cheese Chiesa Dia's at all the aid 
stations.

565
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:11,700
They serve cheese case a day.
Oh my gosh.

566
00:28:11,701 --> 00:28:16,701
It was like a whole buffet line.
Anything you wanted were real about 

567
00:28:16,701 --> 00:28:16,860
these aid stations?
Yeah,

568
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:17,760
it was good.
Oh,

569
00:28:17,761 --> 00:28:19,410
it was amazing.
Wow.

570
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,600
So you could eat cheese,
case ideas and just keep running.

571
00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:24,660
Yeah.
So I would stop at each aid station,

572
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:27,720
um,
demolished a cheese Chiesa Dia,

573
00:28:27,721 --> 00:28:32,670
like hang out for just a second to let 
my body reset and then keep cruising.

574
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:37,730
Wow.
Which normally I'm not very good at 

575
00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:38,160
eating real food during,
but this just felt like too much.

576
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:42,350
There's Cam with the Bacon cheeseburger 
cover you a blanket.

577
00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:43,280
Oh,
that's another thing.

578
00:28:43,281 --> 00:28:45,950
Like there's points in the race where 
it's extremely cold.

579
00:28:45,951 --> 00:28:46,280
Right?

580
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:51,510
It got really cold.
I think we hit nine degrees on the 

581
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:51,510
second night.
And what are you wearing?

582
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:54,490
Um,
a couple of jackets,

583
00:28:54,491 --> 00:28:58,270
like a windbreaker jacket and a rain 
jacket and some gloves.

584
00:28:58,650 --> 00:29:01,060
And like a headband,
some pants,

585
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,230
nothing like absurd.

586
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:05,280
So just the fact that you're constantly 
moving,

587
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:08,370
you stay fairly warm and the windbreaker
is uh,

588
00:29:08,371 --> 00:29:08,680
the,
the,

589
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:11,780
the rain jacket to stop rain or are from
wind.

590
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:16,850
Just layers.
I just wanted to like try and insulate 

591
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:16,850
the body heat.
Are you eating those?

592
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:18,960
Uh,
those little waffle things,

593
00:29:18,961 --> 00:29:22,320
those bee stingers we've had them.
Yeah,

594
00:29:22,321 --> 00:29:23,490
that'd be great.
Or awesome.

595
00:29:23,491 --> 00:29:26,910
So you're just trying to take in like 
the densest stuff,

596
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:31,410
like sugars and cheese in case of 
anything.

597
00:29:31,490 --> 00:29:36,490
Just anything that would stay in.
I didn't want to get nauseous and start 

598
00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:36,560
losing it on the trail.
And

599
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:39,380
Cam said he doesn't go to the bathroom 
the entire time.

600
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,950
Like he doesn't have to just food just 
goes

601
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:44,990
in and just burn.
Yeah.

602
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:49,310
Is that the case with youtube?
Question to ask women bring?

603
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:54,390
It isn't.
But he said he didn't poop for like 

604
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:55,110
three days.
I don't know if that's healthy cam.

605
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:58,810
He's got a lot of healthy problems.
Talk to him.

606
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:02,710
Maybe listen to you.
He doesn't listen to me.

607
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:08,680
No.
I use the restroom while I was out 

608
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:08,680
there.
Did You have to pee?

609
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:12,210
Was.
That's crazy because I would think that 

610
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:12,210
you're sweating so much through would 
just go right through your skin.

611
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:16,180
I'm sure the science of it for awhile I 
was paying way too much,

612
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:21,210
like multiple times per mile and I think
it has something to do with the amount 

613
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:24,370
of salt that you're taking in.
That was another question I had.

614
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:26,530
Do you do.
Are you taking salt tablets?

615
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:31,740
I wasn't until I was having this problem
and then it was like we got to try and 

616
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:34,850
stop this [inaudible] that's not good 
either to go as often.

617
00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:35,820
Has that?
Yeah.

618
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:39,310
So then I took some salt tabs or 
whatever mills.

619
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:41,000
Did that clear it up?
Yep.

620
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,510
Now what are those like?
Do you know what milligrams,

621
00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:45,940
how much salt you're actually taking in?
Nope.

622
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:47,920
No.
S,

623
00:30:48,010 --> 00:30:53,010
s caps or something.
They're just a normal like you can buy 

624
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:54,310
them at any.
Any athletic store.

625
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:57,070
Oh,
so this is just a little pill of salt.

626
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:59,710
I think it's mostly for runners 
essentially.

627
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:02,740
That's all I've seen used them.
But you could.

628
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,960
You could probably have some if you 
wanted.

629
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:08,800
What's the thought process behind it 
though?

630
00:31:08,801 --> 00:31:13,801
The top processes that your body is 
pushing through all these minerals and 

631
00:31:13,801 --> 00:31:17,190
the salt helps you retain water.
And what about other minerals?

632
00:31:17,191 --> 00:31:19,780
Do you have to take magnesium or 
anything else were you doing that?

633
00:31:19,781 --> 00:31:22,480
I didn't know and I don't even really 
know the,

634
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:27,430
the exact contents of that tailwind 
powder that I was putting in.

635
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:31,780
I know it has lots of electrolytes and 
stuff like that that's supposed to help,

636
00:31:31,781 --> 00:31:36,781
but I'm not sure if it has some of the 
other pieces that people need during 

637
00:31:36,781 --> 00:31:38,180
these.
Now before the race gets started,

638
00:31:38,181 --> 00:31:42,190
do you hyperhydrate or you do drink a 
ton of water to get ready or.

639
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:43,750
Yeah,
I tried.

640
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:46,320
I mean,
nothing too crazy but crazy.

641
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,810
No.
What about food before the race?

642
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:51,670
You just eat like a pig and get ready?
No,

643
00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:55,300
no just normal.
Just normal.

644
00:31:55,301 --> 00:31:56,310
Normal.
Natchez.

645
00:31:56,540 --> 00:32:01,200
Just normal beer.
And so like when your,

646
00:32:01,610 --> 00:32:04,420
like as you're leaving like as ready,
set,

647
00:32:04,421 --> 00:32:09,421
go,
what's the state of mind you go into 

648
00:32:09,421 --> 00:32:12,720
when you know that you're about to run 
238 miles and kick everybody's ass?

649
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:15,510
Uh,
it was exciting,

650
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:20,940
it was this big adventure that I had,
I had high expectations of myself while 

651
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:25,930
at the same time having no expectations 
of myself because I didn't know,

652
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:28,000
I didn't know how it was going to go,
um,

653
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:31,510
and I really wanted to just enjoy being 
out there,

654
00:32:31,511 --> 00:32:36,511
like moving my body with my feet for 
multiple days was really exciting so I 

655
00:32:36,701 --> 00:32:39,180
was pumped at the,
at the beginning and um,

656
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:40,250
spent those first

657
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:44,060
probably 50 miles,
like running with various people through

658
00:32:44,061 --> 00:32:49,061
the desert.
There's like canyon walls just like 

659
00:32:49,061 --> 00:32:51,140
towering on every side and just trying 
to enjoy that.

660
00:32:51,141 --> 00:32:56,141
Like this is just the beginning.
If you start to comprehend or think 

661
00:32:56,141 --> 00:32:58,490
about like how far you have to go,
you're going to freak yourself out.

662
00:32:58,491 --> 00:33:00,530
So like just be right now.

663
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:03,590
So you just sort of stay in the moment.
That's what I was trying to do.

664
00:33:03,591 --> 00:33:04,580
Yeah,
just left foot,

665
00:33:04,581 --> 00:33:05,390
right foot,
left foot,

666
00:33:05,391 --> 00:33:07,230
right foot,
go,

667
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:07,880
go,
go,

668
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:09,080
go,
go.

669
00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:14,170
Easy as that.
Is there ever a moment while you're 

670
00:33:14,170 --> 00:33:14,170
doing this where you want to stop

671
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,160
and quit?
Yes.

672
00:33:16,890 --> 00:33:18,390
No,
I never wanted to quit.

673
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:20,100
I,
uh,

674
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:25,250
I knew that the cutoff time was,
was Tuesday night and so no matter what 

675
00:33:26,761 --> 00:33:31,761
happened out there,
I was going to make sure I'm finished 

676
00:33:31,761 --> 00:33:31,830
this race.
Even if I was,

677
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:37,320
I'm coming in Tuesday night,
like if it meant I had to sleep for 

678
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:39,780
many,
many hours or multiple times or if I had

679
00:33:39,781 --> 00:33:41,940
to like death march my way around the 
desert.

680
00:33:41,941 --> 00:33:44,250
I was gonna finish it.
Death March,

681
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,740
you know,
just like slow.

682
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:47,870
Oh,
okay.

683
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:52,040
That's a harsh way of looking at though.
Oh sorry.

684
00:33:52,090 --> 00:33:52,520
No,
no,

685
00:33:53,050 --> 00:33:54,380
don't apologize.
It's good.

686
00:33:55,210 --> 00:33:58,550
So I did notice that there were some 
people that were still running,

687
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:00,650
you know,
after you guys had finished.

688
00:34:00,651 --> 00:34:02,360
And you know,
after Cameron finished,

689
00:34:02,361 --> 00:34:07,361
I stopped looking at the uh,
the time for quite a while and then I 

690
00:34:07,361 --> 00:34:09,170
went like eight hours,
nine hours later and I'm like,

691
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:10,940
oh my God,
people are still running.

692
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:12,880
Yeah,
those are warriors.

693
00:34:12,881 --> 00:34:14,920
They're so impressive.
I mean,

694
00:34:14,921 --> 00:34:18,430
they were out there putting on their 
headlamp for the fifth night.

695
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:22,020
That's a long time to be out there.
And they were,

696
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:27,060
it was incredible.
We got to hang around the finish line 

697
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:27,790
and watched quite a few of those stuck 
around.

698
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:28,930
Yup.
Yeah.

699
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:31,600
That was one of the best parts.
Sleet and ice cream.

700
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:32,830
A drinking beer.

701
00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:40,350
But did you think to yourself like,
how the hell did I finished so much 

702
00:34:40,941 --> 00:34:42,110
faster than anybody?

703
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:44,660
Um,
no.

704
00:34:44,661 --> 00:34:46,760
I thought,
how the heck are these people?

705
00:34:46,910 --> 00:34:50,990
Like so incredible and still going 
after.

706
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:56,080
I mean,
I'd like to think I'd be able to keep 

707
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,320
pushing myself on that fourth day into 
the fourth night,

708
00:34:57,321 --> 00:34:59,330
but that's mentally really hard.

709
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:00,560
Oh,
it's got to be.

710
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:04,160
Yeah.
But you do understand that you stopped.

711
00:35:04,161 --> 00:35:05,720
Everybody's asked.
You Do,

712
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,070
you do get that right?
You,

713
00:35:07,071 --> 00:35:08,900
you're like,
you're so humble.

714
00:35:08,901 --> 00:35:11,810
So this is kind of amazing.
Thank you.

715
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:13,880
Do you understand that though,
right?

716
00:35:13,881 --> 00:35:15,650
I mean it's like has an internalized.

717
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:18,320
Um,
I understand.

718
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:21,080
Yeah.
I put together a pretty good day.

719
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:26,380
When you,
when you stop and you think about when 

720
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:26,380
you reflect and you look back on it were
like,

721
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:27,180
you know,
a week past,

722
00:35:27,181 --> 00:35:30,000
it was about more than two weeks.
How long ago was it?

723
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,260
Oh,
one week.

724
00:35:31,350 --> 00:35:32,010
One Week.
Yup.

725
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:37,160
So you're a week passed it and how do 
you like,

726
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:41,850
how do you process that?
That's still.

727
00:35:41,851 --> 00:35:45,440
I'm still working on it.
Like just the whole adventure.

728
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,790
All the places,
like all the sites.

729
00:35:47,791 --> 00:35:50,010
I got to see the people that I got to 
meet.

730
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:53,310
The fact that my feet carried me that 
far.

731
00:35:53,311 --> 00:35:58,311
Like I'm coming Tuesday.
Ron Solomon choose which ones and 

732
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:02,580
they're called the sense ride.
Have you tried them?

733
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,180
I see you.
You got some Solomon's.

734
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:08,840
I always wear these a trail runner 
things.

735
00:36:09,610 --> 00:36:10,880
Yes,
they.

736
00:36:11,350 --> 00:36:16,350
They're good.
They have a lot of grip when I'm not 

737
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:17,100
wearing those vibrams or were those five
finger shoes too?

738
00:36:17,490 --> 00:36:19,770
I sort of alternate.
So do you run the.

739
00:36:19,790 --> 00:36:22,980
You run the sidewalks in?
Those are just running trails.

740
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:24,640
You run around here?
Yeah.

741
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:26,780
That's awesome.
It's good.

742
00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:31,850
But it's not like Colorado.
You're dealing with altitude and a lot 

743
00:36:31,850 --> 00:36:31,850
more.
You also,

744
00:36:31,850 --> 00:36:32,100
you have like,
didn't someone just die?

745
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:34,710
Some endurance guy just got bit by a 
rattlesnake near you?

746
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:36,390
Yeah,
that's in Golden,

747
00:36:36,391 --> 00:36:37,200
wasn't it?
Yelp,

748
00:36:37,290 --> 00:36:39,150
which is where I live.
Holy Shit.

749
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:42,480
What happened to that dude?
Just really unfortunate.

750
00:36:42,481 --> 00:36:46,560
I don't actually know the whole story,
but he was out on a trail,

751
00:36:46,561 --> 00:36:51,400
like it's a couple miles from my house 
and got bit and had some like,

752
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:54,990
weird reaction to it,
like he had help pretty quickly,

753
00:36:55,210 --> 00:37:00,210
um,
and got to the hospital in pretty good 

754
00:37:00,210 --> 00:37:02,721
time.
But unfortunately something about his 

755
00:37:02,721 --> 00:37:04,210
body and that bite like wasn't good.
Wow.

756
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:06,500
Yeah.
Because I've thought rattlesnakes,

757
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:09,150
like you have a few hours.
Yeah,

758
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:10,170
usually.
Right?

759
00:37:10,350 --> 00:37:12,900
Yeah,
I mean it's not good,

760
00:37:12,901 --> 00:37:17,901
but it's not good at few hours and 
pretty much if you read anything about 

761
00:37:17,901 --> 00:37:20,850
what to do after a rattle snake bite,
those things are wrong.

762
00:37:21,050 --> 00:37:22,980
Like,
you pretty much can't do anything.

763
00:37:23,010 --> 00:37:26,910
You shouldn't suck the venom out.
You shouldn't like slice it open and you

764
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:31,911
shouldn't do anything.
Just get to the hospital as calmly as 

765
00:37:31,911 --> 00:37:32,520
possible.
Shouldn't suck the venom out.

766
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:34,150
No.
What was that?

767
00:37:34,151 --> 00:37:37,850
Uh,
Dan Akroyd movie or he got like Venom is

768
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:39,420
bought and he was telling someone to 
suck the.

769
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:44,650
Remember that.
Remember that.

770
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:52,130
But that word,
but we're going to see it here and it's 

771
00:37:52,130 --> 00:37:54,481
like he's furiously typing because the 
reason why I remember it was because Sam

772
00:37:55,471 --> 00:37:58,490
kinison was mocking him,
was mocking it,

773
00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:01,710
but they almost all had some sort of a 
feud back in the day anyway.

774
00:38:01,770 --> 00:38:04,680
Well if he wasn't in city slickers.
Oh,

775
00:38:04,681 --> 00:38:05,670
okay.
Oh,

776
00:38:05,671 --> 00:38:10,671
that's why Sam Kinison was mocking it.
He got kicked off the original city 

777
00:38:10,671 --> 00:38:11,100
slickers.
He was in it.

778
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:16,340
He was in the original cast and he 
didn't get along with somebody and they 

779
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:16,740
got rid of him.
Well,

780
00:38:16,741 --> 00:38:18,520
it wouldn't have helped if he did suck 
them in.

781
00:38:18,521 --> 00:38:20,010
A lot of people think that you should do
that.

782
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:22,890
I don't know,
old wives' tale or something.

783
00:38:22,891 --> 00:38:25,020
I'm not sure you.
They say you're supposed to cut it,

784
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:28,230
cut it open and yeah,
you're not supposed to do that either.

785
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:30,120
What do you do?
Do you make a tourniquet?

786
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:32,080
I think that's actually a good idea,
right?

787
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:35,980
The,
the latest thing

788
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:40,980
I read that's the best to do is just 
have a sharpie along circle where the 

789
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:44,590
bite is and mark the time and then like 
every 20 minutes as you're.

790
00:38:44,591 --> 00:38:48,460
If you have to hike yourself out or like
you're trying to get somewhere to go get

791
00:38:48,461 --> 00:38:51,310
help,
circle it again 20 minutes later to show

792
00:38:51,311 --> 00:38:56,311
where the swelling has gotten to so that
the doctors have a better idea of like 

793
00:38:56,311 --> 00:38:58,030
how quickly it's moving through you.

794
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:03,720
I saw horrible thing online to this 
young man got bit in his arm and his 

795
00:39:05,081 --> 00:39:08,260
skin started to die and there's tissue 
starts to die,

796
00:39:08,261 --> 00:39:09,130
you know,
necrosis.

797
00:39:09,730 --> 00:39:14,730
And so they had to do all these massive 
skin graphs and just massive surgeries 

798
00:39:15,251 --> 00:39:20,251
and it had essentially rotted down to 
the bone and you can see like the bone 

799
00:39:20,351 --> 00:39:21,760
in his arm.
It was rough,

800
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:23,830
but he,
he lived.

801
00:39:23,910 --> 00:39:27,130
Yeah,
I think you've gone through more than 10

802
00:39:27,131 --> 00:39:28,620
surgeries.
Geez.

803
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,890
Yeah.
It was awful.

804
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,020
And I didn't know the rattle snakes 
could do that to you.

805
00:39:32,021 --> 00:39:32,800
I'm like,
Whoa,

806
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:35,180
you have rattlesnakes here?
Oh yeah.

807
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:39,190
I killed one just a couple of weeks ago 
with your bare hands stomped it.

808
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:43,090
Oh yeah.
I stomped on every chance I get.

809
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:45,010
People say you shouldn't,
but fuck them.

810
00:39:46,610 --> 00:39:48,880
Like if they're near my house like this.
No.

811
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,620
I have kids.
I have little kids like any rattle snake

812
00:39:51,621 --> 00:39:52,750
that's in my yard is dead.

813
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:55,030
What else do you guys are mountain lions
out here?

814
00:39:55,031 --> 00:39:57,100
Yes.
You ever seen one of those?

815
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,290
I've seen them,
but I saw him in Colorado.

816
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,620
I haven't seen one out here.
I saw one in Santa Barbara actually.

817
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,980
That was weird.
It was in Montecito,

818
00:40:05,981 --> 00:40:10,981
which is like this really nice 
residential community and we're driving 

819
00:40:10,981 --> 00:40:11,770
up the road and I saw what I thought was
a coyote.

820
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:14,410
The coyote would a tail.
Oh,

821
00:40:14,530 --> 00:40:16,540
it's a fucking cat.
Just out on the street.

822
00:40:16,570 --> 00:40:18,170
Just out on a regular street.
Yeah,

823
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:21,700
it was a big fucker to know.
I can probably 70,

824
00:40:21,701 --> 00:40:22,620
80 pounds.
You know.

825
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:23,980
Those are scary.
Yeah.

826
00:40:23,981 --> 00:40:26,070
It's like,
it's not big for a mountain lion.

827
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:29,820
They get to be like 1:15.
And what's really interesting on here as

828
00:40:29,821 --> 00:40:34,000
people don't.
Everyone here is so urbanized that their

829
00:40:34,001 --> 00:40:36,370
understanding of what a mountain lion 
is,

830
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:37,430
is like,
you know,

831
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:39,160
they think it's the lion king.

832
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:42,910
There's this one that uh,
he has a name too.

833
00:40:42,911 --> 00:40:47,911
It's like p two or p 41 or some shit.
And he went on a killing rampage at an 

834
00:40:49,121 --> 00:40:54,121
Alpaca farm and killed like 11 alpacas 
and goats.

835
00:40:54,970 --> 00:40:56,530
Yeah.
And doesn't even eat them.

836
00:40:56,830 --> 00:41:01,830
He just went on a rampage and this woman
got a depredation permit to kill it 

837
00:41:02,770 --> 00:41:07,770
because it's her Alpaca farm.
And like this lion is just decided to 

838
00:41:07,770 --> 00:41:09,520
start fucking up or animals and this is 
what she does for a living.

839
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:14,380
And she got all these death threats from
animal rights activists.

840
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,660
I mean like death threats.
Like she was terrified.

841
00:41:16,661 --> 00:41:19,450
So she decided not to do anything.
She's going to hire someone to kill this

842
00:41:19,451 --> 00:41:22,030
mountain lion.
But it's like if you love animals,

843
00:41:22,270 --> 00:41:25,510
wouldn't you want to stop the animal 
that's murdering all her animals?

844
00:41:25,511 --> 00:41:27,900
You fucking crazy assholes.
One,

845
00:41:27,930 --> 00:41:30,310
it's not doing it for food,
which is unusual.

846
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,620
Well,
the apparently they have a reaction.

847
00:41:32,621 --> 00:41:35,270
They can get into a pen when there is a 
bunch of them in there.

848
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,240
They just can't help themselves.
They just,

849
00:41:37,430 --> 00:41:42,430
they just can't help themselves.
They just see them all there and they 

850
00:41:42,430 --> 00:41:43,010
just Jack One and Jack the other one.
And he wasn't even eating them.

851
00:41:43,070 --> 00:41:44,790
He didn't eat any of them.
Yeah,

852
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:48,620
I've never seen one out on a run,
but I've always got my eyes peeled.

853
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:50,240
It would be so scary.
Oh,

854
00:41:50,241 --> 00:41:53,180
they're terrifying.
They're terrifying animals and you know,

855
00:41:53,181 --> 00:41:58,181
for the most part they're important.
They're an important part of the 

856
00:41:58,181 --> 00:42:00,821
ecosystem.
But the weird thing about here is we've 

857
00:42:00,821 --> 00:42:04,301
sort of sectioned off their habitat by 
our highway system and so there's some 

858
00:42:05,331 --> 00:42:10,331
of them that are stuck in the Santa 
Monica mountains and the genetic 

859
00:42:10,331 --> 00:42:13,241
diversity is not very strong.
I actually had a coyote expert on here 

860
00:42:13,490 --> 00:42:15,620
who is a,
he works for the,

861
00:42:15,650 --> 00:42:16,690
what did he work for?
The,

862
00:42:17,390 --> 00:42:22,390
what was the actual organization he 
worked for far with.

863
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:23,290
How was it

864
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:31,410
anyway,
some sort of park ranger type fellow.

865
00:42:31,411 --> 00:42:33,660
A really nice guy.
But he was telling us about,

866
00:42:33,690 --> 00:42:35,460
um,
the ones that they have,

867
00:42:35,461 --> 00:42:38,070
like in Griffith Park,
there's a mount mine in Griffith Park,

868
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:43,460
people jogging and ride their bikes and 
this guy is just out there eating deer 

869
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:45,750
all day long and they have to capture 
him every couple of years.

870
00:42:45,751 --> 00:42:48,920
They have to dart him because his 
collar,

871
00:42:49,270 --> 00:42:49,710
the,
uh,

872
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:52,470
the tracking device on his collar runs 
out of batteries,

873
00:42:52,730 --> 00:42:55,530
so every couple of years they've got to 
put the whack on this guy,

874
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:58,410
put them to sleep and repeat them in the
park.

875
00:42:59,630 --> 00:43:02,070
Exactly.
Want to relocate?

876
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:05,310
No.
It's interesting.

877
00:43:05,330 --> 00:43:10,330
It was one of the good things about 
California is that we don't have a lot 

878
00:43:10,330 --> 00:43:12,330
of car accidents with deer.
You know,

879
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:13,770
it's,
it's very uncommon.

880
00:43:14,070 --> 00:43:16,820
Whereas you said you're from Michigan,
Minnesota,

881
00:43:16,830 --> 00:43:18,170
Minnesota,
Minnesota has a lot,

882
00:43:18,210 --> 00:43:19,010
lot of,
um,

883
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:20,920
a lot of car accidents.
Yeah.

884
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:25,230
And these places where they don't have 
apex predators,

885
00:43:25,830 --> 00:43:26,730
they have a lot more.

886
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:30,440
Do you guys have,
what do you have out there?

887
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:32,540
Like as far as you have wolves in 
Minnesota?

888
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:37,640
Yeah,
so I think like way north there's even 

889
00:43:38,001 --> 00:43:43,001
like,
I mean there's got to be Moose and you 

890
00:43:43,001 --> 00:43:43,001
have mountain lions,
Minnesota.

891
00:43:43,001 --> 00:43:44,900
I don't know about any mountain lions 
out here.

892
00:43:44,901 --> 00:43:49,901
There's a,
there's a lot of coyotes which get the 

893
00:43:49,901 --> 00:43:51,710
Fonz and then there's mountain lions 
which decimate the deer.

894
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:54,260
So no car accident.
Very few deer.

895
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:56,940
California is like a really low dear 
densities state.

896
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:59,270
Interesting.
So there's a.

897
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:04,380
there's good to that.
Northern Minnesota fighting cougars now 

898
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:06,230
believed to be broadcast fighting each 
other.

899
00:44:06,590 --> 00:44:09,160
They're up in a tree.
Yeah,

900
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:11,530
that's a bobcat.
Where's this tail?

901
00:44:12,570 --> 00:44:17,570
This one is the one on the left.
It is that probably to hide some 

902
00:44:20,090 --> 00:44:23,390
cardboard cutout to cut out the size of 
a Cougar Mountain.

903
00:44:23,391 --> 00:44:25,640
My left is compared to the photograph of
a box,

904
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:27,890
just probably doing it for the photos.
Oh yeah.

905
00:44:28,010 --> 00:44:28,610
Oh,
that makes sense.

906
00:44:29,270 --> 00:44:30,550
Passing the time.
Yeah.

907
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:34,290
I saw a bobcat that I thought was a 
cougar.

908
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,860
I saw a bobcat with the cubs and uh,
in,

909
00:44:37,861 --> 00:44:38,940
uh,
at the home ranch.

910
00:44:38,941 --> 00:44:41,860
And I thought it was a cougar.
Yeah.

911
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:47,420
Well I just saw the cat.
I was like this big cat in the road and 

912
00:44:47,420 --> 00:44:47,420
I was like,
whoa.

913
00:44:47,420 --> 00:44:51,921
Is that an outline?
And then we eventually figured out that 

914
00:44:51,921 --> 00:44:52,430
it was a bobcat.
They get to a good size.

915
00:44:53,730 --> 00:44:56,850
We do have bobcats soda.
So I got a question for you.

916
00:44:57,150 --> 00:45:02,150
Can you talk about the run rabbit run 
race you had that you won or that end?

917
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:07,440
I'll let her describe it because it 
sounds pretty crazy what happened.

918
00:45:09,860 --> 00:45:14,860
So the hundred mile race that I was 
doing a month before my lab at about 12 

919
00:45:16,321 --> 00:45:21,321
miles roughly to the finish line,
my vision started blurring like in the 

920
00:45:21,321 --> 00:45:22,030
periphery.
Um,

921
00:45:22,090 --> 00:45:27,090
and over the course of the next couple 
of miles closed in until it was pure 

922
00:45:27,661 --> 00:45:29,430
white,
I couldn't see anything.

923
00:45:29,850 --> 00:45:34,850
Um,
so I just stumbled my way along roughly 

924
00:45:34,850 --> 00:45:37,170
10 miles of trails to get to the finish 
line.

925
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:40,650
Pretty much I would say like 98 percent 
blind.

926
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:44,160
I could see my feet like right in front 
of my feet,

927
00:45:44,161 --> 00:45:49,161
but it was just white out.
So I was running and falling everywhere.

928
00:45:50,490 --> 00:45:53,370
It was probably hilarious if people were
watching.

929
00:45:53,371 --> 00:45:56,570
But um,
I hit my head also on Iraq.

930
00:45:56,590 --> 00:45:58,070
One of them,
yeah,

931
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:01,530
one of the Times I fell.
So I had blood dripping down my face,

932
00:46:01,531 --> 00:46:05,430
like stumbling along.
Totally couldn't see the trail.

933
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:07,020
Still one.
Yeah.

934
00:46:07,021 --> 00:46:09,300
Managed to finish and,
and hold the lead.

935
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:12,510
You're a savage.
Give seminars on how to be a savage.

936
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:14,700
That is crazy.
So what,

937
00:46:14,990 --> 00:46:16,590
what did,
what happened to your vision?

938
00:46:17,130 --> 00:46:22,130
Um,
so since then there's been tons of 

939
00:46:22,130 --> 00:46:24,890
people kind of talking about it.
Apparently it happens in an ultra is 

940
00:46:24,890 --> 00:46:27,150
quite often they are thinking it's a 
corneal edema.

941
00:46:27,630 --> 00:46:31,290
So basically like I wear contact lenses 
to see,

942
00:46:31,470 --> 00:46:36,470
um,
in the like contact mixed with the air 

943
00:46:36,470 --> 00:46:41,301
and the dryness and all sorts of things 
cause like a kind of fluid or I'm not 

944
00:46:41,941 --> 00:46:46,941
really sure how it works.
You ever thought about getting Lasik or 

945
00:46:46,941 --> 00:46:47,460
something?
People who have done lasik also get this

946
00:46:47,461 --> 00:46:51,950
corneal edema.
So for now I'm just a stay in,

947
00:46:52,090 --> 00:46:57,090
stay in with the context because I'm,
I've been learning how to deal with 

948
00:46:57,090 --> 00:47:00,531
those a little bit better.
Did that concern you at all when you 

949
00:47:00,531 --> 00:47:03,650
were about to run 238 miles?
Yeah,

950
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:08,100
I really didn't want to go blind again.
Jesus Christ.

951
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:10,500
But I actually had that course.
Yeah.

952
00:47:10,710 --> 00:47:11,940
Yeah,
right off a cliff.

953
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:18,560
I was using eye drops just like get some
like tears going in there.

954
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:24,980
And I wore glasses for this whole race 
in Moab because that's supposed to help 

955
00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:29,901
as well.
Grit from now when you back and you won

956
00:47:30,190 --> 00:47:32,890
that race and you were basically almost 
blind,

957
00:47:33,130 --> 00:47:34,990
how long did it take for your vision to 
recover?

958
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:36,820
Five.
Six hours.

959
00:47:36,910 --> 00:47:37,570
Oh,
that's it.

960
00:47:37,690 --> 00:47:38,380
Yeah.
Oh,

961
00:47:38,381 --> 00:47:40,930
that must have been a relief.
Such a relief.

962
00:47:40,931 --> 00:47:42,340
Yeah,
it was pretty sick of it.

963
00:47:42,341 --> 00:47:47,341
By the time I finished we.
Were you concerned that it could be 

964
00:47:47,341 --> 00:47:47,341
potentially permanent?

965
00:47:47,341 --> 00:47:47,860
You know,
it didn't feel permanent.

966
00:47:47,861 --> 00:47:52,861
It felt.
I think because it went white and 

967
00:47:52,861 --> 00:47:55,030
because it like moved in slowly.
It felt like topical.

968
00:47:55,031 --> 00:47:55,990
I don't know.
I didn't,

969
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:59,110
I didn't really consider while I was 
racing if it was permanent,

970
00:47:59,111 --> 00:48:04,111
I was just like,
amped on finishing the race at that 

971
00:48:04,111 --> 00:48:04,111
point.
Um,

972
00:48:04,111 --> 00:48:08,020
but once I finished,
no one seemed overly concerned about it.

973
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:13,040
Like we went to the hospital and um,
they were more concerned with checking 

974
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:13,180
out my head.
Um,

975
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:16,800
so it didn't feel like that urgent.
Yeah.

976
00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:17,860
But it was weird.

977
00:48:18,330 --> 00:48:19,890
Yeah.
Did you think about quitting?

978
00:48:20,310 --> 00:48:25,310
No Jew,
even though you're blind and you got a 

979
00:48:25,651 --> 00:48:29,170
concussion,
he looked like carried night.

980
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:31,590
Like what the hell?

981
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:36,640
Well,
I hit my head and it thunked pretty 

982
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:37,040
hard.
And then there was liquid dripping on my

983
00:48:37,041 --> 00:48:42,041
face,
but I put my hand up to touch it and I 

984
00:48:42,041 --> 00:48:43,640
couldn't see my hand in front of my face
to see if it was blood or not.

985
00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:45,620
Wow.
I had no idea.

986
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:47,570
What is this course like you're running 
on?

987
00:48:48,030 --> 00:48:50,150
Um,
it's in steamboat Colorado,

988
00:48:50,151 --> 00:48:55,151
so mountains and I'm pretty rough trails
on this section where I fell.

989
00:48:55,850 --> 00:48:57,470
Um,
yeah.

990
00:48:57,740 --> 00:49:02,120
But the last six miles of the race,
you finally get to like a fire road.

991
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:07,360
So a little bit wider,
a little more room for error if you go 

992
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:07,360
crooked.

993
00:49:09,090 --> 00:49:10,390
That's just so crazy.
So how,

994
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:12,380
how are you knowing where to stop?
You're not,

995
00:49:12,381 --> 00:49:15,980
you're just guessing.
So that's a picture of the course.

996
00:49:15,981 --> 00:49:18,710
Yeah.
So you're running that course blind?

997
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:23,800
Well that sections quite a bit more 
technical than the section I went blind 

998
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:24,530
on.
When you say technical,

999
00:49:24,531 --> 00:49:27,710
what exactly do you mean?
Like big rocks and cliffs,

1000
00:49:27,711 --> 00:49:29,230
stuff like that.
The second thing I wanted to be,

1001
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:30,560
why would that be technical?

1002
00:49:31,430 --> 00:49:32,480
Um,
I dunno,

1003
00:49:32,510 --> 00:49:35,350
that's just the word that I associate 
with like trickier trail,

1004
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:40,330
like you have to be more used technique.
Is that what they're saying?

1005
00:49:40,510 --> 00:49:43,740
Maybe I've heard that term before.
That's why I always ask like,

1006
00:49:43,750 --> 00:49:45,550
people talk about like technical 
terrain,

1007
00:49:45,551 --> 00:49:46,350
like do you know,

1008
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:49,810
I don't know what a,
I don't know the root word for it.

1009
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:54,210
I guess you just can't just flat out 
just huff it.

1010
00:49:54,211 --> 00:49:55,890
You have to think about what you're 
doing.

1011
00:49:56,210 --> 00:49:59,140
Like your foot placement is critical.
A little bit tricky.

1012
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:01,320
Kind of looking down a lot while you're 
running.

1013
00:50:01,650 --> 00:50:03,360
You can't just run straight.
Right?

1014
00:50:03,790 --> 00:50:04,070
Right.
Like,

1015
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:07,200
because most people,
like if you're running on a flat trail,

1016
00:50:07,350 --> 00:50:12,350
you just kind of looking ahead.
You're assuming the road is going to be 

1017
00:50:12,350 --> 00:50:14,841
the same with the left foot as it is for
the right foot and the left say that 

1018
00:50:14,841 --> 00:50:14,841
right.
This,

1019
00:50:14,841 --> 00:50:17,430
you can't right now when you do in 
something like that,

1020
00:50:17,431 --> 00:50:19,560
I would think.
Well you got to constantly looked down.

1021
00:50:19,561 --> 00:50:24,561
That is when I would be concerned about 
like mountain lions or something like 

1022
00:50:24,561 --> 00:50:24,561
that.
Yeah,

1023
00:50:24,561 --> 00:50:24,561
because you're not looking.

1024
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:29,730
Yeah.
And they probably think you're to get 

1025
00:50:29,730 --> 00:50:29,730
away,

1026
00:50:29,730 --> 00:50:29,730
right?

1027
00:50:29,730 --> 00:50:30,160
Yeah.
I,

1028
00:50:30,161 --> 00:50:33,050
I'm pretty sure if you end up seeing the
mountain lion,

1029
00:50:33,051 --> 00:50:34,490
it's already too late for you.

1030
00:50:35,790 --> 00:50:38,700
Did you hear about that kid in Alaska?
They got eaten by a bear and a race.

1031
00:50:38,910 --> 00:50:40,560
Yeah.
That's unfortunate.

1032
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:45,620
Yeah.
Called his mom to call this mom before 

1033
00:50:45,620 --> 00:50:49,101
the bear attacked him and said,
I think there's a bear that's following 

1034
00:50:49,101 --> 00:50:49,101
me.
Yeah,

1035
00:50:49,390 --> 00:50:50,160
yeah,
yeah.

1036
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:53,130
I mean animals are a real part of it out
there.

1037
00:50:53,420 --> 00:50:56,420
There was also a guy who was jogging 
along,

1038
00:50:56,421 --> 00:51:00,440
minding his own business and a hawk came
and tried to swoop him,

1039
00:51:00,470 --> 00:51:05,470
scoop his head.
He had scratches across his whole head 

1040
00:51:05,470 --> 00:51:06,960
from the talents of this hawk.
What?

1041
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:10,670
Pull up that picture?
Yeah.

1042
00:51:11,570 --> 00:51:14,720
What?
Like the Hawk thought he was food,

1043
00:51:14,721 --> 00:51:17,000
so he was going to grab them and bring 
them to the nest.

1044
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:22,300
Gangster Hawk was this guy.
I don't think that little thing like a,

1045
00:51:22,770 --> 00:51:24,460
a,
an an adult.

1046
00:51:24,470 --> 00:51:25,400
I'm pretty sure

1047
00:51:25,530 --> 00:51:30,530
if a hawk landed on my head,
I guarantee you I'm going to have a 

1048
00:51:30,530 --> 00:51:33,231
stuffed hawking here right here.
I'm going to have that fucker and I'm 

1049
00:51:33,231 --> 00:51:36,290
going to have like a plastic hand around
the neck.

1050
00:51:37,380 --> 00:51:40,450
Fucking assholes.
I have hawks in my yard all the time.

1051
00:51:40,451 --> 00:51:43,020
They're trying to get my chickens.
One.

1052
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:48,080
I think they got one.
One of them went missing and we're 

1053
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:48,080
trying to figure out what happened.
Look at that.

1054
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:49,080
Wow.
That is crazy.

1055
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:54,800
That's from the the whatever.
Escaped Harris Hawks are attacking 

1056
00:51:55,861 --> 00:51:59,040
runners and walkers prompting fears 
there now breeding in Britain.

1057
00:51:59,850 --> 00:52:01,740
Oh,
this is an England.

1058
00:52:02,790 --> 00:52:07,790
Wow.
That is a huge gap for people who are 

1059
00:52:07,790 --> 00:52:08,550
just listening.
We're talking like 11,

1060
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:11,320
12 inch gash is on this guy's head and 
the whole head.

1061
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:16,460
His whole.
The whole top of his head is like a 

1062
00:52:16,460 --> 00:52:16,460
track,
like train tracks,

1063
00:52:16,460 --> 00:52:18,780
like two straight lines.
Kind of a cool scar.

1064
00:52:18,781 --> 00:52:20,660
It's going to make the beautiful scar.
Right?

1065
00:52:21,060 --> 00:52:22,890
What happened to you?
Gangster Shit.

1066
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:26,470
I wonder.
I wonder if he did.

1067
00:52:26,750 --> 00:52:28,320
He said,
oh my.

1068
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:30,380
This hawk is trying to take me away.
Oh,

1069
00:52:30,390 --> 00:52:35,100
did someone help me?
That's not the hawk.

1070
00:52:35,130 --> 00:52:36,900
That one looks too small.
Harris Hawk.

1071
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:39,480
So this is an escaped hawk.
They're saying.

1072
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:44,840
So is this a hawk that like essentially 
was a captive hawk and now they got 

1073
00:52:46,231 --> 00:52:51,231
loose and they don't know how to eat,
they don't know what to do and maybe 

1074
00:52:51,231 --> 00:52:56,030
that's crazy.
Maybe it liked thought this guy was a 

1075
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:57,000
give it a shot.

1076
00:52:57,150 --> 00:53:01,920
I recall hearing what I now know is the 
bird's wings flapping behind my head and

1077
00:53:01,921 --> 00:53:03,500
then suddenly just tell him.

1078
00:53:03,740 --> 00:53:05,360
But other than that,
there was no warning.

1079
00:53:05,450 --> 00:53:08,120
She thought it was a mugging.
He thought he got mugged.

1080
00:53:08,540 --> 00:53:11,840
Wow.
What a crazy bird.

1081
00:53:11,841 --> 00:53:14,180
The bird thinking they could kill a 
person.

1082
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:15,390
Yeah,
that is.

1083
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:20,800
That is like gangster burden.
Escaped bird attacking human.

1084
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:25,590
Go back to that again real quick.
What do you say?

1085
00:53:25,591 --> 00:53:28,470
Whilst the attacker was originally 
thought to be a buzzard,

1086
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:30,990
no one had become aggressive during the 
nesting season.

1087
00:53:31,020 --> 00:53:35,370
Experts pointed out the native birds of 
prey seldom strike in the summer months.

1088
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:38,370
Wow.
Harris Hawk.

1089
00:53:39,510 --> 00:53:40,280
Yeah.
Those,

1090
00:53:40,340 --> 00:53:45,340
those things that the claws and those.
We were just talking about eagles the 

1091
00:53:45,340 --> 00:53:45,340
other day,
like imagine like a,

1092
00:53:45,340 --> 00:53:49,820
something that can swoop down and grab a
salmon out of a river and fly off with 

1093
00:53:49,820 --> 00:53:51,750
it.
These ridiculous things they have at the

1094
00:53:51,751 --> 00:53:54,810
bottom of their feet.
Pick up like small deer and stuff.

1095
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:56,310
Yeah,
we can.

1096
00:53:56,670 --> 00:53:56,850
Yeah.

1097
00:53:56,850 --> 00:53:59,860
The Mongols use them to um,
to uh,

1098
00:53:59,970 --> 00:54:01,700
attack wolves.
They,

1099
00:54:01,701 --> 00:54:06,701
uh,
they have trained eagles that they 

1100
00:54:06,701 --> 00:54:06,930
swooped down and they grab wolves and 
they killed the wolves.

1101
00:54:07,170 --> 00:54:10,200
They drop them from the Pi.
They just kill them.

1102
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:12,990
They kill them with their talents.
Their towns are so strong.

1103
00:54:12,991 --> 00:54:15,930
It's like knives.
They just grab a hold her neck and stick

1104
00:54:15,931 --> 00:54:18,660
the towns into the side of the neck.
It's crazy to watch.

1105
00:54:18,661 --> 00:54:20,040
I mean,
these aren't big wolves.

1106
00:54:20,250 --> 00:54:23,040
These are like coyote size wolves,
but it's still,

1107
00:54:23,130 --> 00:54:24,000
it's like,
it's,

1108
00:54:24,020 --> 00:54:29,020
it's so weird to watch.
It's like this thing just trying to run 

1109
00:54:29,020 --> 00:54:29,190
away and this eagle just knows what to 
do.

1110
00:54:29,370 --> 00:54:34,370
Swoops down.
Just grabs him by the neck and wrestle 

1111
00:54:34,370 --> 00:54:36,881
them to the ground.
And then the Mongolian guys come over 

1112
00:54:36,881 --> 00:54:36,881
here.
You can watch it here.

1113
00:54:36,881 --> 00:54:41,600
So they're trained.
See they have those little strings 

1114
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:41,670
coming off the back of your legs and 
there's wolves like fuck.

1115
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:46,620
And so this dude just releases the 
eagle.

1116
00:54:46,770 --> 00:54:50,340
The Eagle swoops down and just death 
from the sky.

1117
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:55,400
Just Jackson.
It's crazy to think that this was 

1118
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:58,700
somehow or another,
they trained these things to do this 

1119
00:54:58,700 --> 00:55:01,491
too,
and then they would kill the wolves and 

1120
00:55:01,491 --> 00:55:05,061
take their skins.
I guess they like make jackets or 

1121
00:55:05,061 --> 00:55:08,361
something.
The Wolf knows what's going on too and 

1122
00:55:08,361 --> 00:55:08,361
look at.
He's so much bigger than the eagle.

1123
00:55:08,361 --> 00:55:09,030
That's what's really crazy because what 
does an ego way,

1124
00:55:09,031 --> 00:55:11,880
like 20 pounds or something like that or
ran a little faster there.

1125
00:55:11,950 --> 00:55:16,950
This tired ass.
They are though.

1126
00:55:18,340 --> 00:55:19,740
It's just.
He loved birds.

1127
00:55:19,770 --> 00:55:24,770
Huge,
but even a huge bird is a fraction of 

1128
00:55:24,770 --> 00:55:26,670
the size of that wolf and then just 
holding them down.

1129
00:55:26,850 --> 00:55:29,550
Then we expand freaks it out.
I just don't think.

1130
00:55:29,551 --> 00:55:32,190
I think it's just a superior murdering 
machine.

1131
00:55:32,250 --> 00:55:32,850
You know what I mean?

1132
00:55:32,910 --> 00:55:36,000
I think like when it comes to like 
nature's killers,

1133
00:55:36,001 --> 00:55:39,290
eagles are just far superior to a wolf.
I mean they,

1134
00:55:39,291 --> 00:55:40,960
they have air on their side.
They,

1135
00:55:40,970 --> 00:55:42,990
they swooped down on you,
which is cool.

1136
00:55:43,050 --> 00:55:44,880
Yeah.
They moved through three d space,

1137
00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:46,590
you know,
it's just a whole different thing.

1138
00:55:46,930 --> 00:55:49,290
So did they ever get your chickens?
Uh,

1139
00:55:49,310 --> 00:55:52,080
I know that a hawk has.
Well we'd know.

1140
00:55:52,081 --> 00:55:55,440
I saw a coyote get one.
I saw a coyote run over the fence with a

1141
00:55:55,441 --> 00:56:00,441
chicken in his mouth.
I was sitting with my wife and my kids 

1142
00:56:00,441 --> 00:56:03,411
were playing some game,
like monopoly or some shit and we look 

1143
00:56:03,411 --> 00:56:06,231
out the window and I see a coyote 
running through the backyard with a 

1144
00:56:06,231 --> 00:56:08,841
chicken in his mouth and he just hops 
the fence and I opened the door just to 

1145
00:56:08,841 --> 00:56:09,760
go,
you fucker like that.

1146
00:56:09,810 --> 00:56:14,810
He was gone and it was a,
it was a very complicated scenario 

1147
00:56:16,561 --> 00:56:19,920
because he actually had talked my dog 
and to helping him.

1148
00:56:20,100 --> 00:56:20,990
No Way.
Yeah,

1149
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,320
I think it was a girl.
I think it was a pretty sure it was girl

1150
00:56:23,321 --> 00:56:25,520
coyote and uh,
my dog.

1151
00:56:25,870 --> 00:56:27,220
Yeah.
My dog thought it was,

1152
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:32,400
have a big dumb dog and he thought that 
like this Murphy wants to play with the 

1153
00:56:32,441 --> 00:56:34,960
triggers and told help them because the 
dog can.

1154
00:56:35,260 --> 00:56:38,680
My dog is a,
he's a nice dog to people,

1155
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:44,040
but he's not nice to chickens.
He's murdered a few chickens in the 

1156
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:44,040
past.
He's got,

1157
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:45,970
I think so far he's killed six of my 
chickens.

1158
00:56:46,090 --> 00:56:47,180
Oh Wow.
Yeah,

1159
00:56:47,350 --> 00:56:50,500
he broke into the fence recently.
I don't think I talked about this.

1160
00:56:52,150 --> 00:56:54,020
We were outside,
um,

1161
00:56:54,150 --> 00:56:56,980
uh,
and we had heard something.

1162
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:02,280
We heard these chickens squawking and 
making up all this noise and I look and 

1163
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:03,460
I'm like,
how is the dog in the chicken coop?

1164
00:57:03,970 --> 00:57:07,360
He clawed through the chicken wire.
He's a massive,

1165
00:57:07,390 --> 00:57:12,390
he's a big man and he's just smash the 
chicken wire enough so he could get his 

1166
00:57:12,851 --> 00:57:17,851
body in there and just went on a rampage
and just was murdering and chickens.

1167
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:19,000
Whoops.
Yeah.

1168
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:20,910
See just their instinct,
you know,

1169
00:57:21,310 --> 00:57:26,310
they just can't help it.
And like a friend of mine said that he 

1170
00:57:26,310 --> 00:57:30,991
had a dog that did that once.
They killed his chicken and he took the 

1171
00:57:30,991 --> 00:57:35,041
dead chicken and tied it on the dog's 
head and then chained the dog to a tree 

1172
00:57:35,470 --> 00:57:37,450
and left him there for a couple hours.
And he said,

1173
00:57:37,990 --> 00:57:42,990
he said it worked.
He said the dog never fucked with the 

1174
00:57:42,990 --> 00:57:44,990
chickens again,
sir.

1175
00:57:46,060 --> 00:57:47,770
Are you going to try that?
Uh,

1176
00:57:47,910 --> 00:57:48,790
no,
no.

1177
00:57:48,820 --> 00:57:50,530
My,
I think my golden retriever,

1178
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:53,650
he's a sweetheart and I think he's 
killed the chicken too.

1179
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:58,920
I don't know if he killed it,
but he showed up with one in his mouth 

1180
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:02,130
and it was dead and we're trying to 
figure out if he killed it or if it was 

1181
00:58:02,130 --> 00:58:02,130
already dead because sometimes they just
die.

1182
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:04,250
She because we don't like to think he's 
a kid.

1183
00:58:04,251 --> 00:58:07,900
He's still a baby,
but he might've died two dogs,

1184
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:09,610
just dogs and chickens.
It's like,

1185
00:58:10,430 --> 00:58:13,900
you know,
it's a classic relationship now.

1186
00:58:14,110 --> 00:58:15,160
I don't know how we got on this.
Oh,

1187
00:58:15,161 --> 00:58:16,030
runners.
Animals.

1188
00:58:16,060 --> 00:58:17,060
Yeah.
Sorry about that.

1189
00:58:17,110 --> 00:58:22,110
Worried about,
do you ever bring any sort of first aid 

1190
00:58:22,110 --> 00:58:23,290
with you?
Do you bring like a backpack when you're

1191
00:58:23,291 --> 00:58:23,650
running?

1192
00:58:24,310 --> 00:58:29,310
Um,
it depends on where I'm going or how 

1193
00:58:29,310 --> 00:58:29,350
long I intend to be out there.

1194
00:58:29,910 --> 00:58:34,910
So like when you're running moab,
do you bring any sort of a backpack or 

1195
00:58:34,910 --> 00:58:34,910
anything?

1196
00:58:34,910 --> 00:58:36,180
Yeah,
I had a pack that was carrying water and

1197
00:58:36,270 --> 00:58:41,220
I'm like an emergency blanket and jacket
just in case and food.

1198
00:58:41,550 --> 00:58:44,950
So when you have an emergency blanket,
is that one of those thin like sort of a

1199
00:58:45,030 --> 00:58:50,030
silvery blankets just folds down into a 
very small those really work?

1200
00:58:51,510 --> 00:58:53,850
Yeah,
I mean fortunately I've never had to use

1201
00:58:53,851 --> 00:58:56,330
one and an actual emergency,
but um,

1202
00:58:56,340 --> 00:59:01,320
you know how after marathons they give 
everyone like a tin foil wrap basically.

1203
00:59:01,470 --> 00:59:04,770
I think it's the same thing where it's 
like holding in your body heat.

1204
00:59:05,460 --> 00:59:08,730
So if worse comes to worse out there,
you've got something to,

1205
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:11,190
to help you get through it rather than 
nothing.

1206
00:59:11,220 --> 00:59:12,150
Right.
Right.

1207
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:17,600
Now,
when you were running a new drinking 

1208
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:17,600
water,
are you,

1209
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:19,050
do you have bottles of water or do you 
have like a hydration bladder in a tube?

1210
00:59:19,051 --> 00:59:20,220
Like what do you,
how do you run it?

1211
00:59:20,590 --> 00:59:22,040
The guy was using has bottles

1212
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:26,330
so it can carry.
I mean at one point I had two and a half

1213
00:59:26,330 --> 00:59:30,200
liters of water with me for like a 
really hot long section.

1214
00:59:30,580 --> 00:59:35,210
How long did that last?
Before I made it last for 20 miles.

1215
00:59:35,300 --> 00:59:37,160
That's crazy.
That's it.

1216
00:59:38,590 --> 00:59:43,590
Two and a half liter.
Seems like a tiny amount of water to 

1217
00:59:43,590 --> 00:59:43,990
drink for 20 miles of running.
God,

1218
00:59:43,991 --> 00:59:44,680
that's crazy.

1219
00:59:44,950 --> 00:59:46,670
Yeah.
And it was a really hot,

1220
00:59:46,671 --> 00:59:48,920
exposed day out there in the desert.

1221
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:54,040
Have you ever been running like a.
Kim was telling me that he did the big 

1222
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:57,781
foot 200 and there was a stretch where 
he miscalculated and you realize that 

1223
00:59:57,781 --> 01:00:01,381
terrain and he didn't have any water.
You to go for several hours with no 

1224
01:00:01,381 --> 01:00:02,180
water.
Have you ever done that before?

1225
01:00:02,530 --> 01:00:04,170
That's awful.
Um,

1226
01:00:04,390 --> 01:00:06,670
I don't know if I've ever had to go 
several hours,

1227
01:00:06,671 --> 01:00:09,310
but yeah,
I've gotten to the point where it's like

1228
01:00:10,030 --> 01:00:14,650
miles and miles away still.
And you're fresh out of water.

1229
01:00:15,290 --> 01:00:16,900
So that's got suck.
Yeah.

1230
01:00:17,100 --> 01:00:17,390
The,
the,

1231
01:00:17,410 --> 01:00:22,410
the,
how much of a performance hit does that 

1232
01:00:22,410 --> 01:00:22,410
take?
I think it depends.

1233
01:00:22,410 --> 01:00:26,570
Like also it can take a big toll out of 
you mentally if you stress out about it 

1234
01:00:26,861 --> 01:00:28,240
too much,
but if you're just like,

1235
01:00:28,420 --> 01:00:33,420
well this is the situation,
the only solution is to get to the next 

1236
01:00:33,420 --> 01:00:33,430
aid station.
Then,

1237
01:00:33,700 --> 01:00:37,150
um,
I think it is just a blip on the radar.

1238
01:00:37,210 --> 01:00:38,530
That's an interesting approach

1239
01:00:39,690 --> 01:00:44,690
and that's what I wanted to get to this 
about how it transcends and how your,

1240
01:00:45,420 --> 01:00:50,420
this,
your mental fortitude sort of like how 

1241
01:00:50,420 --> 01:00:54,051
it manifests itself in everyday life.
Like your ability to just deal with shit

1242
01:00:55,200 --> 01:01:00,200
is so superior to the average person.
Like when you hear people complain like 

1243
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:02,610
starbucks is out of fucking Venti lattes
is such bullshit,

1244
01:01:02,870 --> 01:01:07,870
you know,
like no more Combo macchiatos like 

1245
01:01:07,870 --> 01:01:10,790
normal everyday complaining stuff is 
like what a lot of people sort of engage

1246
01:01:11,071 --> 01:01:16,071
in sort of a recreation.
The people love to complain about 

1247
01:01:16,071 --> 01:01:16,071
nonsense,

1248
01:01:16,071 --> 01:01:16,210
right?
Yeah.

1249
01:01:16,860 --> 01:01:21,210
Well how do you deal with that to each 
their own?

1250
01:01:21,211 --> 01:01:23,520
I think,
I mean it just let it happen.

1251
01:01:23,580 --> 01:01:26,100
If that Venti Latte was going to make 
your day,

1252
01:01:26,101 --> 01:01:28,620
I'm really sorry that they're out,
you know,

1253
01:01:28,670 --> 01:01:32,270
but there's got to be a part of you that
realizes like how.

1254
01:01:33,260 --> 01:01:36,920
I mean,
so many people are just really very weak

1255
01:01:37,130 --> 01:01:39,320
in terms of their ability to overcome 
adversity.

1256
01:01:39,910 --> 01:01:44,910
No,
I think they just aren't giving 

1257
01:01:44,910 --> 01:01:47,281
themselves enough credit and I think 
we're all capable of way more than we 

1258
01:01:47,681 --> 01:01:51,160
think we are if we just like jump in and
go for it,

1259
01:01:51,161 --> 01:01:52,150
whatever it is.

1260
01:01:52,270 --> 01:01:57,270
Right.
And do you think like you realize that 

1261
01:01:57,270 --> 01:02:00,121
more the more you push yourself,
like do you understand yourself more 

1262
01:02:00,121 --> 01:02:00,121
after running 200,
30,

1263
01:02:00,121 --> 01:02:00,400
eight miles?

1264
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:02,670
I'm trying to,
yeah,

1265
01:02:02,671 --> 01:02:04,890
I'm trying to like find my physical 
boundary.

1266
01:02:04,891 --> 01:02:07,320
I'm trying to find the mental boundary,
like where,

1267
01:02:07,620 --> 01:02:12,620
where can I take this and trying to 
learn about myself and about the world 

1268
01:02:12,661 --> 01:02:14,550
and meet people along the way.

1269
01:02:15,050 --> 01:02:20,040
I think that that must give you immense 
confidence to overcome bound obstacles.

1270
01:02:20,041 --> 01:02:25,041
Boundaries,
like the fact that you can do what you 

1271
01:02:25,041 --> 01:02:28,071
can do,
that you can just put your mind into 

1272
01:02:28,071 --> 01:02:30,450
this state of just dealing with the 
constant grime.

1273
01:02:30,451 --> 01:02:32,520
You're falling asleep,
you're half blind.

1274
01:02:32,860 --> 01:02:35,820
I mean the site is more than half blind,
98 percent of blind.

1275
01:02:36,150 --> 01:02:39,390
I mean this has got to sort of 
transcend.

1276
01:02:39,391 --> 01:02:44,391
I mean it's really must sort of make its
way into your everyday life in a very 

1277
01:02:44,391 --> 01:02:46,230
weird way.
I hope so.

1278
01:02:46,620 --> 01:02:49,260
What do you do for regular stuff?
Like do you have a regular job?

1279
01:02:49,710 --> 01:02:54,710
Uh,
I taught middle school and high school 

1280
01:02:54,710 --> 01:02:57,921
science for nine years and just this 
past year I stepped out of the 

1281
01:02:57,921 --> 01:02:58,410
classroom.
So now you just run.

1282
01:02:58,470 --> 01:03:00,570
So currently am I'm running?
Yeah.

1283
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:01,740
Wow.
So how does that work?

1284
01:03:01,741 --> 01:03:03,060
You have sponsors or something like 
that?

1285
01:03:03,210 --> 01:03:08,210
Yup.
I have some sponsors and a really 

1286
01:03:08,210 --> 01:03:10,371
supportive husband and um,
and my school has been super supportive 

1287
01:03:10,921 --> 01:03:15,030
through all this and they were like go 
see what you can do without the,

1288
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:17,670
without the 7:00
AM to 7:00

1289
01:03:17,670 --> 01:03:18,140
PM,
shift,

1290
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:18,820
you know,
like,

1291
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:24,500
see what you can make of this and uh,
and let us know if you want back in 

1292
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:24,840
teaching ever.

1293
01:03:25,250 --> 01:03:27,080
Did they freak out when you won the 
Moab?

1294
01:03:28,460 --> 01:03:33,460
Well,
one of the guys I teach with Islam was 

1295
01:03:33,460 --> 01:03:36,041
actually one of my pacers out there,
so he has been really supportive and 

1296
01:03:36,041 --> 01:03:40,961
awesome to train with and I haven't 
actually talked to anyone else at the 

1297
01:03:40,961 --> 01:03:40,961
school since then,

1298
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:44,950
but they gotta be incredibly proud.
I mean to,

1299
01:03:44,980 --> 01:03:45,730
to say,
hey,

1300
01:03:45,731 --> 01:03:48,340
go go see what you can do.
And they're like,

1301
01:03:48,341 --> 01:03:51,220
hey,
look what I can do here.

1302
01:03:51,230 --> 01:03:54,340
It is pretty crazy.
And then.

1303
01:03:54,350 --> 01:03:55,680
So is this your,
your,

1304
01:03:55,690 --> 01:03:57,400
your goal now is to just run,

1305
01:03:58,140 --> 01:03:58,770
uh,
yeah,

1306
01:03:58,771 --> 01:04:00,330
for the time being,
I want to,

1307
01:04:00,450 --> 01:04:05,450
um,
just see what can happen if I really 

1308
01:04:05,450 --> 01:04:08,631
dedicate more time and energy to 
training and traveling for races and um,

1309
01:04:09,350 --> 01:04:10,590
all of the pieces that go with it.

1310
01:04:10,610 --> 01:04:15,610
That.
And what does the woman's name that put 

1311
01:04:15,610 --> 01:04:15,610
on the job?
Candice.

1312
01:04:15,610 --> 01:04:15,610
Burt.
Generous.

1313
01:04:15,610 --> 01:04:16,960
And does candice like look at.
I know she,

1314
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:18,860
is she involved in bigfoot as well?

1315
01:04:19,120 --> 01:04:21,430
Yeah,
all those 200 mile races are hers.

1316
01:04:21,660 --> 01:04:24,180
But if she looked at the 2:40
now and look at you and go,

1317
01:04:25,510 --> 01:04:27,040
courtney might be able to do three slash
20.

1318
01:04:27,560 --> 01:04:29,210
She,
she,

1319
01:04:29,211 --> 01:04:30,500
uh,
just the other day.

1320
01:04:30,501 --> 01:04:35,501
Suggested on the like 200 facebook group
and she put it out there.

1321
01:04:36,050 --> 01:04:41,050
What about a 500 mile?
Courtney?

1322
01:04:42,120 --> 01:04:43,500
No,
that's candice.

1323
01:04:43,530 --> 01:04:46,790
She suggested.
I know courtney don't do that.

1324
01:04:47,600 --> 01:04:49,820
I mean,
why you're a psycho.

1325
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:52,500
Candice is a crazy person.
Does she run these races to?

1326
01:04:52,930 --> 01:04:57,930
Oh,
well unfortunately when your race 

1327
01:04:57,930 --> 01:04:58,130
directing she can't run the $200,
but she definitely,

1328
01:04:58,131 --> 01:05:00,770
I wish I could wish I could run with you
courtney.

1329
01:05:00,860 --> 01:05:04,370
She does a lot of a 100 mile races and 
yeah,

1330
01:05:04,460 --> 01:05:05,480
it was a great runner.

1331
01:05:06,660 --> 01:05:09,000
500.
That is next level.

1332
01:05:09,001 --> 01:05:11,010
What is the longest anybody has ever 
run?

1333
01:05:11,011 --> 01:05:12,420
Like what's the longest race ever?

1334
01:05:13,610 --> 01:05:15,910
Um,
no.

1335
01:05:16,360 --> 01:05:18,190
Um,
let's see.

1336
01:05:18,190 --> 01:05:23,190
So there's races that are called six day
races and it's just on a small loop and 

1337
01:05:24,101 --> 01:05:29,101
you try and go as far as you can do that
loop as many times as you can in six 

1338
01:05:29,101 --> 01:05:33,301
days.
And I'm not actually sure what the 

1339
01:05:33,301 --> 01:05:36,031
record for that is,
but I'm certain that it's higher than 

1340
01:05:36,031 --> 01:05:38,820
2:38.
So when she's talking about a 500,

1341
01:05:40,100 --> 01:05:41,950
3000,
100 mile race,

1342
01:05:42,110 --> 01:05:43,570
there you go.
Relay race.

1343
01:05:43,880 --> 01:05:48,880
But marathon team look up six day are 
world record.

1344
01:05:50,350 --> 01:05:54,790
Welcome to the 21st annual self 
transcendence,

1345
01:05:54,970 --> 01:05:56,350
3,100
mile race.

1346
01:05:56,351 --> 01:05:58,030
You know why they said the self 
transcendence?

1347
01:05:58,180 --> 01:06:01,120
Because after 2000 miles you run with 
Jesus.

1348
01:06:02,060 --> 01:06:07,060
He's literally with you.
You transcend your running on air.

1349
01:06:08,140 --> 01:06:11,410
That's crazy.
Fifty two days.

1350
01:06:11,590 --> 01:06:16,590
Fifty two days.
They must log an average of 59 point six

1351
01:06:16,691 --> 01:06:18,600
miles a day.
That's fucking wait.

1352
01:06:18,610 --> 01:06:20,410
I think this is the one in New York.

1353
01:06:20,470 --> 01:06:23,410
It's just around like a city block in 
New York or something.

1354
01:06:23,530 --> 01:06:28,530
The runners begin 6:00
AM and run for extended periods 

1355
01:06:28,530 --> 01:06:28,660
throughout the day.
Taking breaks as needed.

1356
01:06:28,661 --> 01:06:31,200
If they want to,
they can continue as late as 12 midnight

1357
01:06:31,210 --> 01:06:35,050
when the course closes for the night.
Oh Wow.

1358
01:06:36,070 --> 01:06:38,080
Whew.
That's pretty cool.

1359
01:06:38,860 --> 01:06:43,860
Boy.
Now the community has got to be a very 

1360
01:06:43,860 --> 01:06:45,790
strange community of like ironed willed 
human beings.

1361
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,550
Oh,
it's such a special community on imagine

1362
01:06:49,010 --> 01:06:54,010
like this.
The character of those people know 

1363
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:55,240
everyone's got a story and they're all 
out there battling their own battle,

1364
01:06:55,241 --> 01:07:00,241
you know,
and it's cool to be at the finish line 

1365
01:07:00,241 --> 01:07:02,290
then and celebrate together and God swap
war stories,

1366
01:07:02,291 --> 01:07:03,080
you know,
I'm sure.

1367
01:07:03,330 --> 01:07:08,200
I mean I just like to find other human 
beings that are capable of putting their

1368
01:07:08,260 --> 01:07:12,380
mind and their body into that position 
and want to do that,

1369
01:07:12,381 --> 01:07:15,800
like choose actively choose to do that 
and look forward to it.

1370
01:07:15,830 --> 01:07:18,820
And look forward to the next one.
Pay Money to do it.

1371
01:07:19,330 --> 01:07:21,900
How much does it cost?
Uh,

1372
01:07:22,150 --> 01:07:27,150
for this one I maybe seven,
800 to win anything?

1373
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:29,110
Nope.
Jesus Christ.

1374
01:07:29,490 --> 01:07:32,050
We've got to get you a prize.
She should have.

1375
01:07:32,380 --> 01:07:34,980
You should win something that alerts.
This is crazy.

1376
01:07:35,350 --> 01:07:38,050
Thinking about how much they win when 
they fucking play golf.

1377
01:07:38,350 --> 01:07:43,350
Oh,
you're knocked a ball in the whole way 

1378
01:07:43,350 --> 01:07:43,350
to go fatso.

1379
01:07:46,820 --> 01:07:50,170
That doesn't impress me at all.
What you do is like,

1380
01:07:50,230 --> 01:07:55,230
I just feel like it's massively 
underrated in terms of society's 

1381
01:07:55,230 --> 01:07:56,200
appreciation of it.
Yeah.

1382
01:07:56,220 --> 01:07:58,960
Well a lot of people don't even know 
these are happening.

1383
01:07:59,350 --> 01:08:04,270
I'm like ultra marathons are a very 
alien thing to a lot of people.

1384
01:08:04,271 --> 01:08:07,030
I wasn't aware of them so I became 
friends with Cam.

1385
01:08:07,031 --> 01:08:08,860
I didn't know anybody.
Who was that crazy.

1386
01:08:09,310 --> 01:08:14,310
So what mileage are you running now?
I only run a couple run like three of 

1387
01:08:14,310 --> 01:08:15,260
the most.
Everyone is like four.

1388
01:08:16,350 --> 01:08:18,570
I mean they have even half marathons on 
trails.

1389
01:08:18,571 --> 01:08:20,610
That would be cool for you to just check
out.

1390
01:08:20,611 --> 01:08:22,140
Trail running is so awesome.

1391
01:08:22,160 --> 01:08:22,970
It is.
Well,

1392
01:08:22,971 --> 01:08:25,190
mostly what I'm doing is like super 
steep hills.

1393
01:08:25,550 --> 01:08:27,560
That's where I like to do.
I do a lot of hill sprints.

1394
01:08:27,740 --> 01:08:28,600
Yeah,
put it's.

1395
01:08:28,620 --> 01:08:31,400
It's made a big difference in my martial
arts training.

1396
01:08:31,470 --> 01:08:34,550
I've been doing it for like six,
eight months maybe.

1397
01:08:34,580 --> 01:08:39,580
No,
January I think I started running so 

1398
01:08:39,580 --> 01:08:42,191
it's more than that.
Incorporated with all sorts of other 

1399
01:08:42,191 --> 01:08:42,350
changes just makes a huge difference in 
my wind.

1400
01:08:42,620 --> 01:08:45,130
Like and I never used it.
I used to feel like my.

1401
01:08:45,170 --> 01:08:48,200
The thought like I guess it was just 
laziness or just didn't want to try it,

1402
01:08:48,201 --> 01:08:53,201
but a lot of people's thought processes.
Well if you do cardio like specific to 

1403
01:08:53,271 --> 01:08:54,830
your athletic event,
right?

1404
01:08:54,831 --> 01:08:57,050
Like if you do Jujitsu,
just do Jujitsu.

1405
01:08:57,080 --> 01:09:02,080
Just do a lot of rolling,
do a lot of sparring and your cardio 

1406
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:02,080
will go up.
Did you do kickboxing?

1407
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:04,550
Just do a lot of kickboxing,
hit the bag a lot and your cardio go up.

1408
01:09:04,580 --> 01:09:09,580
It will,
but I maintain that just it was just 

1409
01:09:09,580 --> 01:09:13,541
sheer cardio from running is a different
thing and that your capacity for cardio 

1410
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:19,150
is expanded.
Especially when you do hit a hill 

1411
01:09:19,150 --> 01:09:20,420
running or sprints things.
So yeah,

1412
01:09:20,421 --> 01:09:22,130
I would think so.
Now if you,

1413
01:09:22,220 --> 01:09:23,990
do you do anything else other than 
running?

1414
01:09:23,991 --> 01:09:25,880
Do you,
are you involved in any other athletics?

1415
01:09:26,350 --> 01:09:27,090
Ah,
right now,

1416
01:09:27,091 --> 01:09:32,091
no,
I played on some like adult coed 

1417
01:09:32,091 --> 01:09:34,290
volleyball and soccer teams recently.
But um,

1418
01:09:34,320 --> 01:09:35,970
otherwise just running right now.

1419
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:41,200
Do you have an illegal longterm goal or 
is there anything that you'd like to 

1420
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:41,200
accomplish?

1421
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:42,560
Um,
I don't know.

1422
01:09:42,650 --> 01:09:44,990
I just want to keep pushing the limits 
and finding,

1423
01:09:45,050 --> 01:09:50,050
finding out what's possible,
going a little bit faster or a little 

1424
01:09:50,050 --> 01:09:50,060
bit further.
Um,

1425
01:09:50,450 --> 01:09:54,560
and getting to see parts of the world is
what I'm hoping for in this next year.

1426
01:09:54,690 --> 01:09:58,730
How many other women when these things 
there's been in the past couple of years

1427
01:09:58,731 --> 01:09:59,630
there has been,
um,

1428
01:09:59,631 --> 01:10:03,380
it's becoming a little more frequent to 
have a female overall winner.

1429
01:10:03,810 --> 01:10:08,810
Yeah.
Because for a long time that wasn't the 

1430
01:10:08,810 --> 01:10:08,810
case.
Right,

1431
01:10:08,810 --> 01:10:08,810
right.
But why do you think that is?

1432
01:10:08,810 --> 01:10:13,570
I'm not sure.
I don't know if I'm like the confidence 

1433
01:10:13,570 --> 01:10:17,201
or the time women are putting in or like
just figuring out nutrition stuff.

1434
01:10:18,260 --> 01:10:23,260
I Dunno,
I dunno what's been the like thing that 

1435
01:10:23,260 --> 01:10:23,260
switched it over,
but um,

1436
01:10:23,260 --> 01:10:25,580
it's not as absurd as it used to be for 
sure.

1437
01:10:25,860 --> 01:10:27,450
Well,
what you do is absurd.

1438
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:32,580
I mean that's absurd to not just win,
but the wind by such an enormous margin,

1439
01:10:32,840 --> 01:10:37,840
you know,
like what an inspiration you must be to 

1440
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:40,011
other young runners that are coming up 
right now and just know that that's 

1441
01:10:40,011 --> 01:10:40,011
possible,
that someone can,

1442
01:10:40,011 --> 01:10:40,140
can do that.

1443
01:10:40,950 --> 01:10:41,730
Yeah,
I mean,

1444
01:10:41,790 --> 01:10:46,350
I,
I hope to inspire future generations.

1445
01:10:46,351 --> 01:10:48,060
My niece like,
I mean,

1446
01:10:48,090 --> 01:10:50,160
that'd be cool.
I don't know if it's happening,

1447
01:10:50,161 --> 01:10:50,520
but okay.

1448
01:10:50,570 --> 01:10:55,570
This is 100 percent happy trying.
I have no desire to do it and you've 

1449
01:10:55,570 --> 01:10:56,030
inspired me.
Oh,

1450
01:10:56,031 --> 01:10:56,730
thank you.
The,

1451
01:10:56,960 --> 01:10:58,640
you know,
the story of the four minute mile,

1452
01:10:58,641 --> 01:10:58,880
right?

1453
01:10:59,500 --> 01:11:00,490
Yeah.
That before,

1454
01:11:00,491 --> 01:11:03,030
who was the guy that Jesse Prefontaine?
No,

1455
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:03,740
not good.
That guy is.

1456
01:11:03,880 --> 01:11:05,800
Who was it that broke the four minute 
mile?

1457
01:11:06,110 --> 01:11:07,360
Was it like Alan,

1458
01:11:07,730 --> 01:11:09,420
I forget his name.
I was gonna say Jesse Owen,

1459
01:11:09,421 --> 01:11:11,540
but it's on him,
but whoever,

1460
01:11:11,570 --> 01:11:13,410
whoever the gentleman was,
it broke the four minute mile.

1461
01:11:13,411 --> 01:11:15,400
They used to literally think it was 
physically impossible.

1462
01:11:15,420 --> 01:11:16,710
Bannister,
Roger Bannister,

1463
01:11:16,711 --> 01:11:18,450
thank you,
but once he broke it,

1464
01:11:18,451 --> 01:11:21,570
then a bunch of people broke afterwards.
Realized it could be possible,

1465
01:11:21,880 --> 01:11:26,880
you know,
which is another one of the reasons why 

1466
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:26,880
when someone says,
Oh,

1467
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:27,380
if you run a marathon,
you have to take six months off.

1468
01:11:27,390 --> 01:11:31,410
Like shut the fuck up.
Nobody knows what people can do mean.

1469
01:11:31,770 --> 01:11:36,770
It's really true that there's.
There are boundaries to human 

1470
01:11:36,770 --> 01:11:37,080
performance that have not been explored 
yet.

1471
01:11:37,110 --> 01:11:38,670
I agree.
Absolutely.

1472
01:11:38,671 --> 01:11:40,170
Yeah,
so people like you,

1473
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:42,180
you're like at the tip of the spear of 
this shit.

1474
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:46,140
You realize that you are,
you are.

1475
01:11:46,170 --> 01:11:48,070
I'm telling you,
you are like in,

1476
01:11:48,071 --> 01:11:53,071
in human history,
I don't think there's a whole lot of 

1477
01:11:53,071 --> 01:11:55,110
people that can ever say that they've 
run $238.

1478
01:11:55,140 --> 01:12:00,060
I bet there's maybe one or two other 
people that have ever walked the face of

1479
01:12:00,061 --> 01:12:02,520
the earth that have done what you did.
Well,

1480
01:12:02,850 --> 01:12:07,850
they might not have ever.
I mean maybe there's some crazy 

1481
01:12:07,850 --> 01:12:09,120
aborigine are some indigenous people 
that we don't know about.

1482
01:12:09,420 --> 01:12:14,420
Someone who lives in Mexico,
in the mountains or something like that 

1483
01:12:14,420 --> 01:12:14,420
has done something crazy like this,
but for the most part,

1484
01:12:14,420 --> 01:12:19,310
I mean,
how many people have ever done what you 

1485
01:12:19,310 --> 01:12:19,310
did?

1486
01:12:19,310 --> 01:12:20,330
I think there are 95 finishers at the 
rab to 40.

1487
01:12:20,390 --> 01:12:24,860
But how many people have done it in less
than 58 hours this year?

1488
01:12:24,861 --> 01:12:27,320
Just one.
But I think it'll keep falling.

1489
01:12:27,650 --> 01:12:29,390
That's my,
my thought process.

1490
01:12:29,810 --> 01:12:32,990
And do you think that there's anything 
left?

1491
01:12:33,540 --> 01:12:38,540
Um,
do you think you left anything on the 

1492
01:12:38,540 --> 01:12:38,540
table as far as like when you crossed 
the line,

1493
01:12:38,630 --> 01:12:43,630
was there a thought like I could have 
done that maybe like five minutes 

1494
01:12:43,630 --> 01:12:43,630
faster?

1495
01:12:43,910 --> 01:12:44,930
Uh,
I mean,

1496
01:12:44,931 --> 01:12:45,530
sure,
yeah,

1497
01:12:45,531 --> 01:12:50,531
you can cut out time at aid stations.
You can do sections more efficiently.

1498
01:12:51,050 --> 01:12:56,050
So I,
my hope is there's always room for 

1499
01:12:56,050 --> 01:12:58,271
improvement and if I went back next year
I would absolutely be trying to push the

1500
01:12:58,671 --> 01:13:01,940
pace and drop my time.
What would you try to get an under 50?

1501
01:13:02,420 --> 01:13:04,340
I don't know.
I think I'd just have to see how the day

1502
01:13:04,341 --> 01:13:07,940
was unfolding and I'm like,
what sort of obstacles were coming up?

1503
01:13:08,270 --> 01:13:13,270
If you did it under 50,
I guarantee you some people would just 

1504
01:13:13,270 --> 01:13:13,270
throw themselves off the side of the 
car.

1505
01:13:17,030 --> 01:13:22,030
Fuck this.
It'd be like me playing basketball 

1506
01:13:22,030 --> 01:13:22,030
against Jordan and I'm like,
I can't do this anymore.

1507
01:13:23,810 --> 01:13:24,530
You know what I mean?

1508
01:13:25,020 --> 01:13:25,980
I don't know.
Seven.

1509
01:13:26,010 --> 01:13:29,400
That'd be almost eight hours cut off and
I don't think I can.

1510
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:31,120
That'd be a lot.
Yeah,

1511
01:13:31,710 --> 01:13:34,650
but why?
Why not a person that came in second,

1512
01:13:35,310 --> 01:13:40,310
if you didn't exist,
that person who came in second would be 

1513
01:13:40,310 --> 01:13:40,310
a bad motherfucker.
Look,

1514
01:13:40,310 --> 01:13:42,660
I just beat everybody's ass and this 
crazy race.

1515
01:13:43,160 --> 01:13:48,160
He means so much.
He's a little bummed out right now.

1516
01:13:48,480 --> 01:13:52,500
He sit at home going fucking 10 hours.
I bet that guy gets a good night's sleep

1517
01:13:52,501 --> 01:13:56,360
and brushes his teeth and forgets about 
it for a little while,

1518
01:13:56,380 --> 01:13:59,310
gets in his car and then he's in traffic
and the light turns red.

1519
01:13:59,311 --> 01:14:03,810
He was fucking 10 hours,
10 hours.

1520
01:14:06,900 --> 01:14:11,900
I guarantee you.
I hope you're not thinking that shot 

1521
01:14:11,900 --> 01:14:11,900
show.
I.

1522
01:14:11,900 --> 01:14:11,900
You're thinking,
Sean.

1523
01:14:12,050 --> 01:14:15,100
I would be thinking to good news.
Beat me by 10 days.

1524
01:14:15,850 --> 01:14:18,730
Think of.
Think of it in terms of,

1525
01:14:18,910 --> 01:14:19,810
well it's,
it's,

1526
01:14:19,870 --> 01:14:22,000
you know,
you're the high watermark now I guess.

1527
01:14:22,001 --> 01:14:25,300
I mean,
I can't imagine there's any other way to

1528
01:14:25,301 --> 01:14:27,970
put it.
You won the first one,

1529
01:14:28,180 --> 01:14:30,040
but you want it by such a ridiculous

1530
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:31,880
margin.
Yeah.

1531
01:14:31,881 --> 01:14:35,870
We'll see next year.
What people are capable of now.

1532
01:14:35,871 --> 01:14:38,150
Candice and her crazy idea for 500 
miles.

1533
01:14:38,210 --> 01:14:40,330
Are you going to indulge her in this 
ridiculous quest?

1534
01:14:41,030 --> 01:14:41,750
I mean,
yeah,

1535
01:14:41,751 --> 01:14:46,751
she threw it out there.
She had like immediately positive 

1536
01:14:46,751 --> 01:14:49,550
response from everyone in this,
in this group of course.

1537
01:14:49,640 --> 01:14:51,080
But just fucking psycho.
I know.

1538
01:14:51,081 --> 01:14:53,390
Yeah.
And she was saying maybe 20,

1539
01:14:53,391 --> 01:14:55,520
19.
She'd be able to pull it together.

1540
01:14:55,850 --> 01:14:56,300
Oh,
why?

1541
01:14:56,301 --> 01:15:01,301
Why does she need that much time?
I mean the logistics involved and then 

1542
01:15:01,301 --> 01:15:03,410
there's like permitting you have to do.
And where would you,

1543
01:15:03,470 --> 01:15:04,940
where would she have one of these 
things?

1544
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:10,120
She didn't say.
How about the surface of the sun or the 

1545
01:15:10,120 --> 01:15:10,120
moon?
I'm like,

1546
01:15:10,120 --> 01:15:10,120
let's all go to the movies.

1547
01:15:10,230 --> 01:15:11,030
Easy.
It's cold.

1548
01:15:16,110 --> 01:15:16,650
Yeah.
None.

1549
01:15:16,660 --> 01:15:18,200
No gravity.
You'd be like cheating.

1550
01:15:19,120 --> 01:15:21,290
It's only like one sixth,
one,

1551
01:15:21,291 --> 01:15:22,160
sixth.
Earth's gravity.

1552
01:15:22,640 --> 01:15:23,210
Yeah.
I mean,

1553
01:15:23,211 --> 01:15:26,870
I just wonder like,
what is the limit?

1554
01:15:27,050 --> 01:15:30,730
Like what is the limit of a human in 
terms of like mean?

1555
01:15:31,090 --> 01:15:34,220
You said that when it was over,
you were wrecked for days,

1556
01:15:34,490 --> 01:15:37,400
you couldn't sleep,
you really weren't eating well,

1557
01:15:38,450 --> 01:15:41,390
but when you cross that finish line and 
if someone said,

1558
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:43,180
okay,
the real

1559
01:15:43,210 --> 01:15:48,070
finish line is another 80 miles,
you just would've kept going.

1560
01:15:49,360 --> 01:15:50,350
Yeah.
If that's,

1561
01:15:50,410 --> 01:15:53,800
if that was real and I had 80 more miles
to cover,

1562
01:15:53,810 --> 01:15:56,620
I would figure out how to do it.
What have is 180?

1563
01:15:56,710 --> 01:16:01,710
How many,
how many more miles did you think you 

1564
01:16:01,710 --> 01:16:01,710
have left in your body?
I mean there's,

1565
01:16:01,710 --> 01:16:05,460
there a point where you're,
you're just tissue would just give out 

1566
01:16:05,460 --> 01:16:05,770
maybe.
Yeah.

1567
01:16:06,290 --> 01:16:11,290
Um,
but like for this 500 mile ratios 

1568
01:16:11,290 --> 01:16:14,520
suggesting there's like a,
she's thinking a 10 day cutoff or 

1569
01:16:14,520 --> 01:16:14,520
whatever.
Oh God.

1570
01:16:14,740 --> 01:16:17,410
So then you just got to build in some 
good sleep.

1571
01:16:17,411 --> 01:16:22,411
And I'm sorry candice,
if we weren't supposed to talk about 

1572
01:16:22,411 --> 01:16:22,411
this yet,
I don't know.

1573
01:16:22,990 --> 01:16:27,990
We're talking about it.
That's like that's 10 days is not.

1574
01:16:28,840 --> 01:16:29,650
Well,
I guess,

1575
01:16:29,830 --> 01:16:31,300
but no one's going to do that,
right?

1576
01:16:31,301 --> 01:16:36,301
You're just going to keep running.
No one's going to just go 50 miles a 

1577
01:16:36,301 --> 01:16:36,301
day.

1578
01:16:36,301 --> 01:16:36,301
Right.
You could like,

1579
01:16:36,301 --> 01:16:38,230
you can build that into your plan.
Yeah.

1580
01:16:38,620 --> 01:16:40,840
But no one's going to do that.
I mean for this one,

1581
01:16:40,841 --> 01:16:45,841
people had sleep plans.
There's aid stations out there that had 

1582
01:16:45,841 --> 01:16:48,550
like cots and blankets and you can stay.
They say for six hours,

1583
01:16:48,551 --> 01:16:51,520
they'll let you sleep there before they 
boot you to the course.

1584
01:16:51,550 --> 01:16:53,380
Six hours,
six hours get up.

1585
01:16:53,381 --> 01:16:54,310
Lazy.
Yeah.

1586
01:16:54,460 --> 01:16:57,430
I don't know if they just want to keep 
turning them over in case there's a need

1587
01:16:57,431 --> 01:17:00,850
for more or that makes sense.
So they wake you up at six hours.

1588
01:17:01,060 --> 01:17:06,060
Apparently I didn't have.
I don't have any personal experience 

1589
01:17:06,060 --> 01:17:06,060
doing it off the car.

1590
01:17:06,060 --> 01:17:08,780
Just live right on the ground right now.
What?

1591
01:17:09,860 --> 01:17:10,010
I'm

1592
01:17:10,010 --> 01:17:13,200
not getting up right here.
It's over.

1593
01:17:13,490 --> 01:17:18,490
Yeah.
So I guess for this one they'd have to 

1594
01:17:18,490 --> 01:17:18,620
have sleep stations out there and I mean

1595
01:17:19,320 --> 01:17:24,320
I see what I'm getting at is the 
fascinating part of this to me is that 

1596
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:28,331
the boundaries are in least somewhat 
unexplored because what you did was in a

1597
01:17:31,371 --> 01:17:35,050
way very revolutionary,
like what you did was like,

1598
01:17:35,080 --> 01:17:40,080
like you just,
you just flip the whole thing on its 

1599
01:17:40,080 --> 01:17:42,491
head by coming in 10 hours and 20 plus 
miles ahead of the second place person.

1600
01:17:44,930 --> 01:17:46,670
Like now people are going to go,
okay,

1601
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:48,680
well what,
what's possible?

1602
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:50,930
Because maybe there's someone out there 
that can do that at Courtney.

1603
01:17:51,380 --> 01:17:52,730
Yeah,
absolutely.

1604
01:17:52,731 --> 01:17:56,420
There is like glue.
I haven't met them.

1605
01:17:56,590 --> 01:17:59,510
I'm really exists.
I don't know if that's the question.

1606
01:17:59,511 --> 01:18:04,511
That's the cool part is if people just 
keep like wandering that then we'll be 

1607
01:18:04,851 --> 01:18:06,800
breaking down all sorts of barriers.

1608
01:18:06,930 --> 01:18:11,880
That's what's fascinating about it to me
as a completely outside observer is that

1609
01:18:11,881 --> 01:18:16,881
what you're doing is you're essentially 
an unexplored territory and even the 

1610
01:18:18,871 --> 01:18:20,280
training protocols,
right?

1611
01:18:20,310 --> 01:18:23,850
Like your protocols different than cams 
and I'm sure that Sean,

1612
01:18:23,851 --> 01:18:28,851
God's got a different thing that he did 
and everybody's got their own little 

1613
01:18:28,851 --> 01:18:29,930
methods and wasn't there a guy that was 
leading for awhile but he had a,

1614
01:18:30,030 --> 01:18:31,920
he had a bail,
like 150 miles.

1615
01:18:31,921 --> 01:18:33,060
He couldn't take it anymore.

1616
01:18:33,130 --> 01:18:35,290
Yep.
So I was going back and forth for awhile

1617
01:18:35,320 --> 01:18:38,330
with a guy until maybe.
Yeah,

1618
01:18:38,331 --> 01:18:40,750
I think it was 150 miles.
What happened to him?

1619
01:18:40,990 --> 01:18:45,990
I'm not sure.
I think his legs or his quads or 

1620
01:18:45,990 --> 01:18:46,510
something was given out.
I'm not positive.

1621
01:18:46,511 --> 01:18:47,350
I didn't get to have it.

1622
01:18:47,540 --> 01:18:52,540
Your conversation with him in,
does that happen often where someone 

1623
01:18:52,540 --> 01:18:56,111
just comes out of the gate too hard or 
maybe like he's trying to keep up with 

1624
01:18:56,111 --> 01:18:56,540
you and he outpaced himself?

1625
01:18:57,100 --> 01:19:02,100
Yeah.
Unfortunately they're called dns or did 

1626
01:19:02,100 --> 01:19:02,100
not finish.
Um,

1627
01:19:02,100 --> 01:19:06,600
and those happened pretty frequently.
What's the percentage if you had to 

1628
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:07,660
guess?
It was 100 plus people entered,

1629
01:19:07,661 --> 01:19:08,510
right?
Yeah.

1630
01:19:08,710 --> 01:19:10,410
I think this,
the 200,

1631
01:19:11,020 --> 01:19:14,060
the Moab race had way less than a 
normal,

1632
01:19:14,061 --> 01:19:16,300
like hundred mile race.
For example.

1633
01:19:16,320 --> 01:19:18,640
We left dnfs way less people dropped 
out.

1634
01:19:18,641 --> 01:19:19,900
Yeah.
Interesting.

1635
01:19:20,170 --> 01:19:22,030
I don't know if it's like the mindset 
going in,

1636
01:19:22,031 --> 01:19:24,430
you just know it's this big adventure 
and,

1637
01:19:24,470 --> 01:19:26,410
and you're going to be out there for 
multiple days,

1638
01:19:26,411 --> 01:19:29,560
so you're ready for that versus a 100 
mile race.

1639
01:19:29,860 --> 01:19:33,670
I mean people are breaking down barriers
with how fast those can be done.

1640
01:19:34,170 --> 01:19:35,390
Um,
and so then you're,

1641
01:19:35,500 --> 01:19:40,500
you're going out guns blazing from the 
start and then you've got a higher 

1642
01:19:40,500 --> 01:19:42,970
potential for a blow up that just can't 
be fixed.

1643
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:45,240
So is that what happens?
Like your,

1644
01:19:45,250 --> 01:19:47,430
your muscles just break down,
you get,

1645
01:19:47,970 --> 01:19:50,190
what is it called autolysis or something
like that.

1646
01:19:50,250 --> 01:19:51,480
Your muscles start eating themselves.

1647
01:19:51,500 --> 01:19:53,480
Yeah.
And just like no response.

1648
01:19:53,481 --> 01:19:56,150
You're getting nothing back from um.
Yeah.

1649
01:19:56,151 --> 01:19:59,550
And what is that thing that,
those crossfit people get robbed?

1650
01:19:59,551 --> 01:20:01,290
Doe myelocytic.
Oh yeah.

1651
01:20:01,660 --> 01:20:04,100
Do you ever get that?
I've never gotten it wrapped.

1652
01:20:04,160 --> 01:20:06,200
Rhabdo.
Rhabdomyolysis.

1653
01:20:06,290 --> 01:20:07,320
Yeah.
Something about like,

1654
01:20:07,321 --> 01:20:08,190
your muscles

1655
01:20:08,190 --> 01:20:10,650
are breaking down into your bloodstream 
or.

1656
01:20:11,330 --> 01:20:12,450
Yeah,
that's not good.

1657
01:20:12,570 --> 01:20:17,570
It's supposed to be horrible and 
apparently you like way more common 

1658
01:20:17,570 --> 01:20:20,220
today than it muscle breakdown damages 
the kidneys.

1659
01:20:20,580 --> 01:20:23,550
Apparently.
It's way more common today because of,

1660
01:20:23,551 --> 01:20:28,551
uh,
these crossfit classes and people push 

1661
01:20:28,551 --> 01:20:29,900
themselves and push.
That's the thing is like,

1662
01:20:29,970 --> 01:20:32,220
it's not a matter of what's possible.
Like,

1663
01:20:32,221 --> 01:20:34,740
Hey,
courtney ran 248 miles.

1664
01:20:34,830 --> 01:20:36,480
I can run it to,
well,

1665
01:20:36,510 --> 01:20:37,710
yeah,
maybe,

1666
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:41,330
but you're going to have to build up to 
that stupid kids.

1667
01:20:41,420 --> 01:20:43,020
Just do it tomorrow.
You know?

1668
01:20:43,021 --> 01:20:45,030
That's kind of the crazy thing about all
this,

1669
01:20:45,031 --> 01:20:46,680
right?
Is that like you're,

1670
01:20:46,710 --> 01:20:50,880
you're building like a mountain one lego
block at a time.

1671
01:20:51,420 --> 01:20:53,490
Right.
And someone who's like,

1672
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:56,070
oh,
well her mountains like 5,000

1673
01:20:56,071 --> 01:20:57,900
feet,
I'll just fucking build a footnote.

1674
01:20:57,920 --> 01:21:01,230
So it takes a long ass time to build 
that mountain.

1675
01:21:01,290 --> 01:21:01,710
Right?

1676
01:21:02,020 --> 01:21:03,010
Yeah.
I mean for me,

1677
01:21:03,011 --> 01:21:08,011
I've been,
I've been training for this long stuff 

1678
01:21:08,011 --> 01:21:10,381
for seven years now,
so I wasn't like instantly successful at

1679
01:21:11,191 --> 01:21:16,191
the hundred mile distance and it's taken
a lot of training and a lot of just 

1680
01:21:16,191 --> 01:21:16,390
learning along the way

1681
01:21:17,580 --> 01:21:22,580
now because of the fact that you ran 
this 238 mile race at a certain pace and

1682
01:21:23,260 --> 01:21:28,260
did so phenomenally.
Do you feel like your body is now going 

1683
01:21:28,260 --> 01:21:29,940
to be stronger for the next one?
I hope so.

1684
01:21:30,360 --> 01:21:34,710
I hope if I treat it nicely for a little
bit here and let it fully recover,

1685
01:21:35,020 --> 01:21:40,020
um,
that then I can try and springboard off 

1686
01:21:40,020 --> 01:21:40,020
of this for the next day.

1687
01:21:40,020 --> 01:21:40,550
Plenty Nachos.
Plenty of beer.

1688
01:21:40,620 --> 01:21:42,260
Yeah.
Just loaded in.

1689
01:21:42,320 --> 01:21:44,240
No.
Do you do any other kinds of training?

1690
01:21:44,241 --> 01:21:48,830
Do you do any weight lifting or yoga or 
anything else you incorporate?

1691
01:21:48,831 --> 01:21:49,340
Anything else?

1692
01:21:49,420 --> 01:21:50,680
Yeah,
um,

1693
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:53,080
I do.
I go to the gym mostly at the gym.

1694
01:21:53,081 --> 01:21:58,081
I do core work and like throw,
throw around a couple of five pound 

1695
01:21:58,081 --> 01:22:02,020
dumbbells.
But otherwise,

1696
01:22:02,200 --> 01:22:07,200
no,
I think yoga would be a great thing to 

1697
01:22:07,200 --> 01:22:07,200
incorporate.
I just haven't,

1698
01:22:07,200 --> 01:22:09,700
I haven't gotten the motivated to head 
to those classes.

1699
01:22:10,950 --> 01:22:15,060
That's so funny.
How do you stretch a sometimes,

1700
01:22:17,370 --> 01:22:20,130
but wouldn't you think that that would 
be a good thing to do?

1701
01:22:20,131 --> 01:22:21,420
I mean.
Oh absolutely.

1702
01:22:21,510 --> 01:22:22,290
Why don't you do it?

1703
01:22:22,980 --> 01:22:24,480
I mean I try.
Yeah.

1704
01:22:24,690 --> 01:22:28,020
It's just not like incorporated into my 
normal routine.

1705
01:22:28,021 --> 01:22:28,590
Very well.

1706
01:22:29,930 --> 01:22:32,120
Do you think maybe like things along 
those lines,

1707
01:22:32,121 --> 01:22:37,121
like maybe yoga or weightlifting or 
stretching would maybe possibly advance 

1708
01:22:37,121 --> 01:22:38,300
you to another level?
Yeah,

1709
01:22:38,301 --> 01:22:40,790
I mean I might as well try and see.
Yeah.

1710
01:22:40,791 --> 01:22:41,900
But that's what I'm thinking.
I'm like,

1711
01:22:41,901 --> 01:22:46,901
you're so far ahead now that I,
I would imagine it's a matter of like 

1712
01:22:48,500 --> 01:22:51,490
what could possibly make you better like
your,

1713
01:22:51,491 --> 01:22:54,920
you're obviously trying to win by that 
extreme.

1714
01:22:54,921 --> 01:22:58,520
A margin.
Like I would think obviously what you're

1715
01:22:58,521 --> 01:23:00,830
doing now is amazing.
Like what if it ain't broke,

1716
01:23:00,831 --> 01:23:01,880
don't fix it.
Right?

1717
01:23:02,640 --> 01:23:06,430
But are you your very best?

1718
01:23:07,700 --> 01:23:09,230
Um,
I hope not.

1719
01:23:09,350 --> 01:23:12,050
I'm going to keep trying to strive for 
higher.

1720
01:23:12,360 --> 01:23:15,090
Just keep putting lego blocks up,
keep building.

1721
01:23:15,570 --> 01:23:17,370
I like that.
And I love Lego's.

1722
01:23:18,120 --> 01:23:23,120
Who Does it?
But it seems like it's a fairly good 

1723
01:23:23,120 --> 01:23:23,120
analogy.
You know,

1724
01:23:23,120 --> 01:23:27,381
that it seems that it's a slow,
arduous process of improvement and it 

1725
01:23:27,931 --> 01:23:32,931
takes discipline and constant focus and 
constant attention and just time in.

1726
01:23:33,460 --> 01:23:35,070
Yeah.
And enjoying it too.

1727
01:23:35,071 --> 01:23:39,310
Like that's a huge part of it for me as 
well as I'm loving it still.

1728
01:23:39,311 --> 01:23:39,760
So.

1729
01:23:39,870 --> 01:23:42,160
But do you think that's part of the 
success as well,

1730
01:23:42,161 --> 01:23:43,360
the enthusiasm that you have?

1731
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:48,520
I think it's gotTa be if,
if you're out there grinding everyday 

1732
01:23:48,520 --> 01:23:49,440
for hours and you're just hating it,
I mean,

1733
01:23:49,730 --> 01:23:53,090
then you won't be jazzed to go to any 
starting line.

1734
01:23:53,300 --> 01:23:53,750
Yeah.
Well that's

1735
01:23:54,100 --> 01:23:58,300
sort of what you were saying about the 
water thing that if you're low on water,

1736
01:23:58,330 --> 01:24:03,330
like don't just,
don't let it freak you out to just deal 

1737
01:24:03,330 --> 01:24:04,960
with it and it will be less like of that
really does apply to life,

1738
01:24:04,961 --> 01:24:05,440
doesn't it?

1739
01:24:06,070 --> 01:24:07,240
I think so,
yeah.

1740
01:24:07,420 --> 01:24:09,340
Yeah.
No matter if you run or not,

1741
01:24:09,341 --> 01:24:14,341
I think I'm just figuring out how to 
deal with situations like that without 

1742
01:24:14,710 --> 01:24:17,920
freaking out.
And having a record day is huge.

1743
01:24:18,420 --> 01:24:21,510
Now what about runner's high?
How high do you get when you run in like

1744
01:24:21,511 --> 01:24:23,220
that?
Is that real?

1745
01:24:24,150 --> 01:24:25,410
Yeah,
I get it.

1746
01:24:25,411 --> 01:24:30,390
I just get tired.
You get runner's high.

1747
01:24:31,030 --> 01:24:31,840
Sure.
Yeah.

1748
01:24:31,841 --> 01:24:36,610
I mean when you're out there like 
cruising along some beautiful trails and

1749
01:24:36,730 --> 01:24:41,730
you're in an amazing place and um,
you feel really good and maybe you're 

1750
01:24:41,730 --> 01:24:45,520
with people or maybe not.
It definitely can feel really awesome,

1751
01:24:47,590 --> 01:24:49,210
but people like sort of chased that 
down.

1752
01:24:49,211 --> 01:24:54,211
Right.
There's some people that that is like 

1753
01:24:54,211 --> 01:24:56,731
the only way they stay sane.
I think you got to go out and get their 

1754
01:24:56,731 --> 01:24:59,221
medicine in that running.
Do you have like an end goal?

1755
01:25:01,090 --> 01:25:06,090
Like do you do,
do you look at like this running career 

1756
01:25:06,090 --> 01:25:06,090
and go,
okay,

1757
01:25:06,090 --> 01:25:09,310
I'm going to get to be x amount of age,
I want to accomplish a certain amount of

1758
01:25:09,311 --> 01:25:13,420
things and then stop.
Or is it just life?

1759
01:25:14,840 --> 01:25:16,550
Yeah,
life is just life.

1760
01:25:16,900 --> 01:25:20,840
The cool part about this running stuff,
I mean you alluded to it earlier,

1761
01:25:20,841 --> 01:25:24,140
but people in their forties and fifties 
and sixties,

1762
01:25:24,141 --> 01:25:28,910
they're doing these races and I'm still 
enjoying the trails and I hope to.

1763
01:25:29,990 --> 01:25:32,840
I hope to still be doing it when in 20 
years,

1764
01:25:32,841 --> 01:25:33,710
in 30 years,

1765
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:38,840
my friend Ari,
his dad who was a holocaust survivor 

1766
01:25:38,840 --> 01:25:41,100
who's 80 years old just ran a marathon 
in six hours.

1767
01:25:41,940 --> 01:25:42,370
Fucking.

1768
01:25:42,750 --> 01:25:43,830
That's amazing

1769
01:25:44,980 --> 01:25:46,900
Doug.
I mean,

1770
01:25:46,901 --> 01:25:48,820
come on.
I can't run a marathon.

1771
01:25:48,821 --> 01:25:50,860
Six hours.
I know burt can't that fat.

1772
01:25:50,861 --> 01:25:53,410
Fuck sorry Brent.
I love you.

1773
01:25:54,180 --> 01:25:59,180
It's inside joke.
That's a total inside joke,

1774
01:26:00,600 --> 01:26:03,920
but his are.
His Dad is like,

1775
01:26:03,960 --> 01:26:04,190
how

1776
01:26:04,190 --> 01:26:05,570
does,
how does one do that?

1777
01:26:05,630 --> 01:26:07,970
How does it.
How is an 80 year old man run a marathon

1778
01:26:07,971 --> 01:26:09,500
in six hours?
That's insane.

1779
01:26:09,950 --> 01:26:10,910
That's cool.
Yeah.

1780
01:26:10,911 --> 01:26:12,080
Just grinding.
Yeah.

1781
01:26:12,860 --> 01:26:17,860
I mean,
what is the oldest competitor that you 

1782
01:26:17,860 --> 01:26:18,410
guys had in that race?
I'm 69,

1783
01:26:18,411 --> 01:26:19,670
I think.
Wow.

1784
01:26:20,230 --> 01:26:23,000
How did they do?
He finished.

1785
01:26:23,840 --> 01:26:25,520
Yeah,
it's amazing.

1786
01:26:25,580 --> 01:26:30,250
Sixty nine years old and he runs 238.

1787
01:26:30,690 --> 01:26:32,900
I think he had something.
Uh,

1788
01:26:32,970 --> 01:26:37,170
he's 69 years old and it was like his 
6,800

1789
01:26:37,171 --> 01:26:40,770
plus mile race he'd ever done or 
something crazy like that.

1790
01:26:41,030 --> 01:26:42,840
At that age.
You're on borrowed time.

1791
01:26:43,890 --> 01:26:46,810
Why not just burn that candle with a 
blowtorch?

1792
01:26:47,970 --> 01:26:50,340
Fuck the wick.
Just throw that candle in the fall.

1793
01:26:50,341 --> 01:26:51,330
Kaino.
Yeah.

1794
01:26:51,331 --> 01:26:53,550
Or maybe he's making more time.
He might be.

1795
01:26:53,730 --> 01:26:55,080
Couldn't be Rhonda.
Patrick.

1796
01:26:55,120 --> 01:26:58,240
Dr Rhonda Patrick,
who's this brilliant moment of added fat

1797
01:26:58,241 --> 01:27:03,241
on the podcast a few times,
posted something on twitter just a 

1798
01:27:03,241 --> 01:27:06,871
couple of days ago that regular rigorous
physical exercise can expand,

1799
01:27:07,910 --> 01:27:11,830
lowers the biological age by as much as 
nine years.

1800
01:27:11,940 --> 01:27:13,900
Wow.
Was it seems like you find that.

1801
01:27:14,200 --> 01:27:19,200
Yeah,
it's some crazy study they did on 

1802
01:27:19,200 --> 01:27:19,200
extended.

1803
01:27:19,200 --> 01:27:20,750
Since any rigorous exercise

1804
01:27:21,160 --> 01:27:26,160
goes,
a physical exercise reduces cancer 

1805
01:27:26,160 --> 01:27:27,130
incidence is lower than the rates of 
recurrence inhibits tumor growth.

1806
01:27:27,160 --> 01:27:27,670
Uh,
no.

1807
01:27:27,671 --> 01:27:29,180
It's one that I retweeted.

1808
01:27:30,710 --> 01:27:31,620
It was here it is

1809
01:27:32,010 --> 01:27:37,010
intensity exercise,
delayed biological aging by nine years 

1810
01:27:37,010 --> 01:27:40,670
as measured by telomere length.
So was just like scientific analysis of 

1811
01:27:41,371 --> 01:27:42,420
your telomeres.

1812
01:27:43,420 --> 01:27:44,590
That's amazing.
So like what,

1813
01:27:44,591 --> 01:27:46,210
nine years every time you.

1814
01:27:46,620 --> 01:27:47,190
No,
no,

1815
01:27:47,191 --> 01:27:52,191
no,
but I mean like people who are 

1816
01:27:52,191 --> 01:27:52,191
rigorously exercising.
So you say if you,

1817
01:27:52,191 --> 01:27:56,500
you're 39,
your telomeres results showed that 

1818
01:27:56,500 --> 01:27:59,160
regular activity accounted for 
significantly longer.

1819
01:27:59,161 --> 01:28:04,161
Telomeres in US adults,
the longer telomeres found an act of 

1820
01:28:04,161 --> 01:28:05,850
adults accounted for nine years of 
reduced cellular aging.

1821
01:28:06,240 --> 01:28:11,240
Regular physical exercise activity 
reduces disease risk possibly due to 

1822
01:28:11,240 --> 01:28:11,240
the,
uh,

1823
01:28:11,240 --> 01:28:13,530
preservation of telomeres.
Wow.

1824
01:28:13,770 --> 01:28:18,770
So that's an interesting thing because 
for the long telomeres are nucleo 

1825
01:28:18,770 --> 01:28:22,970
protein caps positioned at the end of 
chromosomes and agent causes telomeres 

1826
01:28:23,041 --> 01:28:26,910
to shorten significantly and results in 
gradual sell deterioration.

1827
01:28:27,170 --> 01:28:32,170
And that makes sense because you see 
people that don't exercise and they get 

1828
01:28:32,170 --> 01:28:33,660
older and they look like shit as opposed
to someone who does exercise and they'll

1829
01:28:33,661 --> 01:28:35,040
stand right next to them and you go,
whoa.

1830
01:28:35,100 --> 01:28:36,830
Does those two people the same age?
I.

1831
01:28:36,850 --> 01:28:37,530
that's crazy.

1832
01:28:37,780 --> 01:28:40,960
That's cool that they're studying that.
That will be interesting to see like how

1833
01:28:40,961 --> 01:28:43,240
that unfolds as they learn more.

1834
01:28:43,610 --> 01:28:44,670
It makes sense,
right?

1835
01:28:44,671 --> 01:28:49,671
You're requiring more of your body.
Your body has to maintain this much 

1836
01:28:49,671 --> 01:28:50,280
higher work rate than the average 
person.

1837
01:28:51,050 --> 01:28:52,650
Yeah.
That's cool.

1838
01:28:52,830 --> 01:28:54,720
How much sleep do you get a night?
A normal night.

1839
01:28:54,930 --> 01:28:56,760
Normal.
Probably seven or eight hours.

1840
01:28:57,130 --> 01:28:58,520
So just normal stuff.
Yeah.

1841
01:28:58,830 --> 01:29:01,050
Like you're not,
you're not doing anything crazy?

1842
01:29:01,130 --> 01:29:02,100
No.
Other than

1843
01:29:02,100 --> 01:29:07,100
the actual accomplishment physically.
Like you're not doing anything crazy 

1844
01:29:07,100 --> 01:29:07,110
outside of it?
I don't think so.

1845
01:29:07,140 --> 01:29:08,660
Do you get massages?
No.

1846
01:29:08,910 --> 01:29:10,160
No.
Really?

1847
01:29:10,750 --> 01:29:13,920
Do you wear those crazy pants?
What are those?

1848
01:29:13,930 --> 01:29:15,120
Uh,
those crazy pants.

1849
01:29:15,121 --> 01:29:17,190
It's Smush your legs.
And what are those things called?

1850
01:29:17,191 --> 01:29:18,080
Compression.
Those.

1851
01:29:18,090 --> 01:29:23,090
The Cam,
they send them to me and I sent them to 

1852
01:29:23,090 --> 01:29:23,090
him.
Like compression tights or.

1853
01:29:23,090 --> 01:29:23,090
No,
no,

1854
01:29:23,090 --> 01:29:23,090
no,
no,

1855
01:29:23,090 --> 01:29:24,180
they,
they massage your legs.

1856
01:29:24,181 --> 01:29:25,820
You're like,
he put them both.

1857
01:29:26,400 --> 01:29:28,110
I'll have them send them to you.
They send them to me.

1858
01:29:28,111 --> 01:29:31,410
I didn't even ask for them.
And they like the big boots.

1859
01:29:31,510 --> 01:29:33,900
The other pants.
NORMATEC NORMATEC.

1860
01:29:33,930 --> 01:29:35,520
There's supposed to be the shit.
No.

1861
01:29:35,580 --> 01:29:38,000
Yeah,
pull up a video of the NORMATEC system.

1862
01:29:38,220 --> 01:29:40,370
They sent it to me and I,
I sent it to camp.

1863
01:29:40,380 --> 01:29:43,800
See if you find Cam's a instagram video 
of him using it,

1864
01:29:44,130 --> 01:29:47,580
but you climb into that thing and it 
massages your leg.

1865
01:29:47,610 --> 01:29:50,280
It says pulse,
leg recovery system.

1866
01:29:50,550 --> 01:29:54,820
People swear by these things that are.
Good question.

1867
01:29:55,770 --> 01:29:57,240
Good question.
Doesn't show up.

1868
01:29:57,930 --> 01:29:59,820
Um,
but uh,

1869
01:29:59,830 --> 01:30:02,130
that could be cool if it wasn't even no 
water.

1870
01:30:02,790 --> 01:30:03,420
Oh,
right.

1871
01:30:04,170 --> 01:30:05,950
Have you done cryotherapy?
Nope.

1872
01:30:06,440 --> 01:30:09,360
You want to do it today?
Please write down the street.

1873
01:30:09,610 --> 01:30:10,110
Well,
what does it,

1874
01:30:10,140 --> 01:30:11,520
what does that involve?
Exactly?

1875
01:30:11,521 --> 01:30:14,190
Involves 240 degrees below zero for 
three minutes.

1876
01:30:14,220 --> 01:30:15,410
Oh Jeez.
Hey,

1877
01:30:15,510 --> 01:30:17,040
standing there.
It's awesome.

1878
01:30:17,370 --> 01:30:18,630
Come out.
You feel fantastic.

1879
01:30:19,160 --> 01:30:20,100
If you want to do it,
we could do it.

1880
01:30:20,101 --> 01:30:22,110
Areas.
Oh,

1881
01:30:22,111 --> 01:30:24,780
that's cool.
So that's him at a place doing it.

1882
01:30:25,530 --> 01:30:27,720
Looks like he has one at home now that I
sent them.

1883
01:30:27,721 --> 01:30:28,980
They sent me one.
I didn't even ask for.

1884
01:30:28,981 --> 01:30:30,390
I don't know how they got my address or 
anything.

1885
01:30:31,020 --> 01:30:32,550
They just sent me a normatec.
I'm like,

1886
01:30:32,560 --> 01:30:34,950
okay.
I sat in my wife's like,

1887
01:30:35,180 --> 01:30:37,260
again,
I'll just send it to cam.

1888
01:30:37,310 --> 01:30:37,800
He'll use it.

1889
01:30:38,380 --> 01:30:40,060
So he uses it.
But you didn't,

1890
01:30:40,120 --> 01:30:41,060
did you try it?
No,

1891
01:30:41,200 --> 01:30:41,860
no,
no.

1892
01:30:42,040 --> 01:30:47,040
Sorry.
Athletes using it to like Lebron James 

1893
01:30:47,040 --> 01:30:47,040
uses it.
Like after training it looks bad ass.

1894
01:30:47,400 --> 01:30:48,960
There's all these different methods of 
recovery.

1895
01:30:48,961 --> 01:30:52,110
But court don't need shit.
Good pitches.

1896
01:30:52,180 --> 01:30:53,490
You guys keep using it.

1897
01:30:53,940 --> 01:30:54,270
Did,
uh,

1898
01:30:54,330 --> 01:30:57,390
when you were running the long,
the long digital like a certain playlist

1899
01:30:57,391 --> 01:31:02,391
over and over and over again.
Like do you hate certain songs now that 

1900
01:31:02,391 --> 01:31:02,391
you're listened to him for 60 hours 
straight or.

1901
01:31:02,760 --> 01:31:06,450
No.
Headphones and I use music occasionally.

1902
01:31:06,451 --> 01:31:11,451
I didn't use it for the entire thing.
I probably did a couple of hours with 

1903
01:31:11,451 --> 01:31:15,330
music the first day and um,
maybe a couple hours of music the second

1904
01:31:15,331 --> 01:31:19,840
day just to like pat or ipod.
I mean someone,

1905
01:31:20,130 --> 01:31:23,040
Hey,
I need it back on board who are like,

1906
01:31:23,041 --> 01:31:25,670
I want to change it up a bit.
Cool,

1907
01:31:25,760 --> 01:31:26,250
cool.
Yeah.

1908
01:31:26,251 --> 01:31:27,420
So most of the time when you're 
training,

1909
01:31:27,421 --> 01:31:29,160
do you use music or.
No?

1910
01:31:29,670 --> 01:31:32,280
I don't often use music.
Some days I will,

1911
01:31:32,281 --> 01:31:37,281
but especially out on trails.
I mean we just talked about all these 

1912
01:31:37,281 --> 01:31:39,270
animals that can kill you that I'm not 
using music.

1913
01:31:39,380 --> 01:31:41,310
Right.
If you don't hear the rattle that suck.

1914
01:31:41,430 --> 01:31:46,430
Right.
Or like the wings flapping behind your 

1915
01:31:46,430 --> 01:31:48,490
head before you get a scalping.
Yeah.

1916
01:31:49,160 --> 01:31:52,250
Now did they test you guys for drugs?
Occasionally.

1917
01:31:52,251 --> 01:31:54,390
Some races have that.
This one did not.

1918
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:58,010
So you can be jacked up to the gills.
How many people?

1919
01:31:58,160 --> 01:32:03,160
How many people you think were juiced up
to the gills and they still couldn't 

1920
01:32:03,160 --> 01:32:03,580
beat you?
This one at this race,

1921
01:32:03,581 --> 01:32:08,581
no one was Jewish.
There's someone out there is one person 

1922
01:32:08,581 --> 01:32:09,580
who's on epo for sure.
I won't believe it.

1923
01:32:09,610 --> 01:32:11,320
I believe it.
One person,

1924
01:32:11,980 --> 01:32:15,670
like none of that stuff is like 
filtering into the trail running scene.

1925
01:32:16,060 --> 01:32:20,020
I mean there was a $0 prize on the line,
so I understand that.

1926
01:32:20,080 --> 01:32:22,240
Why is someone going to epo for that?

1927
01:32:22,380 --> 01:32:24,510
I know what you're saying and it's very 
logical.

1928
01:32:24,540 --> 01:32:26,850
You're right.
But there was actually a,

1929
01:32:26,920 --> 01:32:31,920
an article that was written about a 
silicon valley ceos that were taking epo

1930
01:32:33,690 --> 01:32:38,690
and doing triathlons and a marathon 
races and they were taking these 

1931
01:32:39,391 --> 01:32:44,391
endurance drugs.
He's a performance enhancing drugs just 

1932
01:32:44,391 --> 01:32:47,541
for.
I mean just to try to up their 

1933
01:32:47,541 --> 01:32:50,391
performance in these amateur events that
it's a big thing that it's a very common

1934
01:32:51,151 --> 01:32:52,530
thing lately.
Interesting.

1935
01:32:52,590 --> 01:32:53,490
Yeah,
I would.

1936
01:32:53,910 --> 01:32:58,910
I mean,
I don't even know where the fuck they 

1937
01:32:58,910 --> 01:32:58,910
get it.

1938
01:32:58,910 --> 01:33:01,510
Yeah.
I don't know what all that would 

1939
01:33:01,510 --> 01:33:01,510
involve,
but um,

1940
01:33:01,510 --> 01:33:04,990
I like to think better of the,
of the trail running community and that 

1941
01:33:04,990 --> 01:33:06,320
people are pushing just their natural 
limits without,

1942
01:33:06,770 --> 01:33:08,820
without seeing what the,
what,

1943
01:33:08,900 --> 01:33:09,920
any sort of drug reps.

1944
01:33:10,130 --> 01:33:11,710
I would like to think better of them 
too.

1945
01:33:11,920 --> 01:33:16,920
But I just,
I'm because of the UFC have seen so many

1946
01:33:17,141 --> 01:33:17,940
people.
Oh,

1947
01:33:17,941 --> 01:33:20,140
I've got a drug test that I didn't think
I was like,

1948
01:33:20,141 --> 01:33:21,700
that guy.
Wow.

1949
01:33:21,990 --> 01:33:24,400
Huh?
I just think take Abbott fail.

1950
01:33:24,480 --> 01:33:25,960
No habits.
All beer.

1951
01:33:25,990 --> 01:33:27,430
He wasn't my guy.
He's your guy.

1952
01:33:27,610 --> 01:33:29,650
He's an animal,
he's a,

1953
01:33:29,710 --> 01:33:31,540
he was an anywhere,
anytime guy,

1954
01:33:31,990 --> 01:33:36,990
he'd fight anybody.
He would hop off a bar stool and beat 

1955
01:33:36,990 --> 01:33:37,550
the shit out of people we used to rent 
like for,

1956
01:33:37,910 --> 01:33:40,530
for uh,
the videos from blockbuster.

1957
01:33:41,520 --> 01:33:46,360
It does it before I was involved.
Those were awesome.

1958
01:33:46,690 --> 01:33:47,410
No,
no.

1959
01:33:47,411 --> 01:33:49,840
Uh,
I gougey no fish hooking,

1960
01:33:50,470 --> 01:33:53,290
but there was probably definitely dudes 
that were on steroids.

1961
01:33:53,560 --> 01:33:55,000
I mean,
I don't know if he ever took anything,

1962
01:33:55,300 --> 01:33:57,120
but there's a lot of people that have 
worked,

1963
01:33:57,130 --> 01:34:02,130
things like that.
Then you can take whatever you wanted 

1964
01:34:02,130 --> 01:34:02,130
and there was no drug testing,
right?

1965
01:34:02,130 --> 01:34:03,860
The early days.
But you know,

1966
01:34:03,870 --> 01:34:08,870
like it's,
it's like how much does that help and 

1967
01:34:08,870 --> 01:34:09,160
how much,
how much is,

1968
01:34:09,520 --> 01:34:11,110
especially when it comes to trail 
running,

1969
01:34:11,111 --> 01:34:14,620
like what you're doing is first of all,
you're living at elevation,

1970
01:34:14,680 --> 01:34:15,940
which is phenomenal,
right?

1971
01:34:16,420 --> 01:34:21,420
Then you're also just constantly putting
in the work and grinding and it's a full

1972
01:34:21,521 --> 01:34:26,521
time job now and you're obviously a 
special athlete when it comes to your 

1973
01:34:26,521 --> 01:34:28,780
ability to focus and you went fucking 
blind lady.

1974
01:34:29,860 --> 01:34:31,390
He lived.
Why you kept running,

1975
01:34:31,740 --> 01:34:36,740
you know,
so there's no drugs out there that can 

1976
01:34:36,740 --> 01:34:36,740
fix that.
There's no,

1977
01:34:36,740 --> 01:34:37,960
there's no,
there's nothing that's going to give you

1978
01:34:37,961 --> 01:34:41,020
that kind of mental fortitude to push 
past blindness.

1979
01:34:41,180 --> 01:34:43,790
Right.
And they're getting better about.

1980
01:34:43,791 --> 01:34:48,791
I mean,
more and more trail races are starting 

1981
01:34:48,791 --> 01:34:49,820
to implement a drug testing just to try 
and like,

1982
01:34:50,520 --> 01:34:53,330
I'm cut it out before it even becomes a 
thing

1983
01:34:53,350 --> 01:34:54,490
that's smart.
Yeah,

1984
01:34:54,580 --> 01:34:55,300
yeah,
yeah.

1985
01:34:55,301 --> 01:34:57,500
Weed out all the performance enhancing 
stuff,

1986
01:34:57,501 --> 01:34:58,790
but you know,
there's going to be,

1987
01:34:59,450 --> 01:35:00,500
there's a line,
right?

1988
01:35:00,501 --> 01:35:03,140
Like what,
what are you test for and what don't you

1989
01:35:03,141 --> 01:35:04,070
test for?
Like what's,

1990
01:35:04,110 --> 01:35:05,690
what's okay,
you know,

1991
01:35:05,900 --> 01:35:07,730
multivitamins or okay,
alright,

1992
01:35:07,910 --> 01:35:09,440
what about,
you know,

1993
01:35:10,010 --> 01:35:12,500
there's some weird stuff that people 
take,

1994
01:35:12,501 --> 01:35:14,270
you know,
some really good stuff from GNC,

1995
01:35:15,020 --> 01:35:17,450
you know,
we're having issues with that in the UFC

1996
01:35:17,451 --> 01:35:22,451
were guys take just over the counter 
stuff at GNC and it turns out it 

1997
01:35:22,451 --> 01:35:22,451
actually,
uh,

1998
01:35:22,451 --> 01:35:23,480
steroids in it.
Yeah.

1999
01:35:23,970 --> 01:35:26,160
Apparently it's super common that these,
you know,

2000
01:35:26,170 --> 01:35:29,420
all these muscle building,
this and rail stack that,

2001
01:35:29,700 --> 01:35:31,940
you know,
a lot of that stuff is they,

2002
01:35:31,970 --> 01:35:35,180
they literally put performance enhancing
drugs in them,

2003
01:35:35,960 --> 01:35:39,290
which is why they work.
So then it's just your job as an athlete

2004
01:35:39,291 --> 01:35:42,800
to know what's on the ingredient list 
and is it okay?

2005
01:35:43,130 --> 01:35:46,310
Yeah.
You saw it actually has a list of things

2006
01:35:46,311 --> 01:35:50,570
that have tested positive for steroids 
and it is crazy.

2007
01:35:50,930 --> 01:35:55,010
I had Jeff Novitsky on who was the head 
of Usada and now works for the UFC.

2008
01:35:55,011 --> 01:36:00,011
He's a drug enforcement program and 
trying to catch people cheating and we 

2009
01:36:00,011 --> 01:36:02,460
pulled up the Usada website and your jaw
drops,

2010
01:36:02,510 --> 01:36:07,510
like what supplements you're buying from
just a regular mom and pop vitamin 

2011
01:36:11,571 --> 01:36:13,820
store.
Just crazy steroids in them.

2012
01:36:15,140 --> 01:36:17,180
Then you,
but you just take a multivitamin.

2013
01:36:17,390 --> 01:36:18,020
That's it.
Yeah.

2014
01:36:18,530 --> 01:36:21,230
Just a women's multivitamin or a women's
multivitamin.

2015
01:36:23,060 --> 01:36:25,250
Is there a difference now?
I don't know.

2016
01:36:25,251 --> 01:36:27,350
It's probably a marketing scheme 
probably.

2017
01:36:27,351 --> 01:36:32,351
Right.
And do you think that there's anything 

2018
01:36:32,351 --> 01:36:33,620
that you could take that would possibly 
enhance your performance in any way?

2019
01:36:33,630 --> 01:36:36,710
I mean,
is there that's legal?

2020
01:36:36,900 --> 01:36:39,480
Yeah,
I mean is there,

2021
01:36:39,530 --> 01:36:42,110
what is something that other runners 
rely on?

2022
01:36:42,110 --> 01:36:47,110
Is there something that like you hear 
people talk about like vitamins or 

2023
01:36:47,110 --> 01:36:48,130
supplements or anything?
No,

2024
01:36:48,131 --> 01:36:53,131
I think more the conversation is always 
about the diets and like changing up 

2025
01:36:53,811 --> 01:36:58,811
what you eat or what you,
what food groups you live in and all of 

2026
01:36:58,811 --> 01:37:03,370
that is more what I hear talk about and 
I'm just not interested in cutting out 

2027
01:37:04,250 --> 01:37:07,310
carbs or cutting out fat.
Like I want it all.

2028
01:37:07,311 --> 01:37:11,300
So yeah,
that's one of the guys that ran.

2029
01:37:11,330 --> 01:37:14,240
He ran a hundred miles.
What does this gentleman's name?

2030
01:37:14,241 --> 01:37:19,241
He's actually emailed me.
He ran 100 miles faster than anybody 

2031
01:37:19,641 --> 01:37:21,710
ever.
And he's on some fat burning diet.

2032
01:37:21,730 --> 01:37:23,780
He's on one of those.
That Quito.

2033
01:37:23,810 --> 01:37:26,630
Yeah,
he's on a ketogenic diet and his whole,

2034
01:37:26,680 --> 01:37:29,730
his name Zack bitter.
Yeah.

2035
01:37:29,880 --> 01:37:31,600
You know who that guy is?
Yeah,

2036
01:37:32,180 --> 01:37:33,260
he is.
Uh,

2037
01:37:33,510 --> 01:37:34,160
he,
he,

2038
01:37:35,150 --> 01:37:36,590
he won.
There it is.

2039
01:37:37,400 --> 01:37:39,620
Yeah.
He eats almost no carbs.

2040
01:37:39,890 --> 01:37:41,030
Carbs are my favorite.

2041
01:37:43,250 --> 01:37:45,410
Well,
you brought up something to that I think

2042
01:37:45,411 --> 01:37:47,460
is really important.
That really neat.

2043
01:37:47,470 --> 01:37:50,160
Can't be stressed enough is that 
everybody's body is different.

2044
01:37:50,900 --> 01:37:53,900
It really is.
He ran a hundred miles in 11 hours.

2045
01:37:53,901 --> 01:37:57,720
Forty minutes and 55 seconds.
What a monster.

2046
01:37:57,760 --> 01:38:00,000
Yeah,
that's on a quarter mile track.

2047
01:38:00,150 --> 01:38:04,710
Six and a half marathons.
That is insane.

2048
01:38:04,770 --> 01:38:08,970
Four hundred and two laps on a track.
Jesus Christ.

2049
01:38:09,430 --> 01:38:10,410
That's awesome.
Yeah.

2050
01:38:10,411 --> 01:38:12,600
He's a really great athlete.
That's a,

2051
01:38:12,601 --> 01:38:14,430
that's a monster.
That's insane.

2052
01:38:14,670 --> 01:38:18,450
What's incredible that he could do this 
with almost no carbs.

2053
01:38:18,770 --> 01:38:19,650
Fat,
right.

2054
01:38:19,830 --> 01:38:21,180
You're just not interested in trying 
that?

2055
01:38:21,480 --> 01:38:22,260
No,
I mean,

2056
01:38:22,261 --> 01:38:24,210
I don't,
I don't see a need for it.

2057
01:38:24,211 --> 01:38:25,660
I should,
yeah.

2058
01:38:26,290 --> 01:38:27,410
I want to.
Um.

2059
01:38:27,560 --> 01:38:29,440
I'm not saying they aren't enjoying 
life,

2060
01:38:29,441 --> 01:38:34,090
but the things that I enjoy involve,
just not worrying about it.

2061
01:38:34,320 --> 01:38:39,320
Yeah.
Like do you regulate your sugar intake 

2062
01:38:39,320 --> 01:38:42,060
at all?
Know if you've run as much as you run,

2063
01:38:42,061 --> 01:38:44,220
you don't have to think about your diet 
at all.

2064
01:38:44,250 --> 01:38:44,730
Right?

2065
01:38:44,980 --> 01:38:47,530
I don't.
I mean maybe that could be one of the,

2066
01:38:47,650 --> 01:38:50,830
the lego pieces that I try and find 
tune,

2067
01:38:50,831 --> 01:38:54,070
but it's not on my to do list for the 
near future.

2068
01:38:54,380 --> 01:38:55,250
Yeah,
I mean,

2069
01:38:55,520 --> 01:38:57,410
again,
it's like if it ain't broke,

2070
01:38:57,411 --> 01:38:59,990
don't fix it.
What if someone like comes creeping up,

2071
01:38:59,991 --> 01:39:03,890
like real close to your courtney,
someone starting to like your,

2072
01:39:03,920 --> 01:39:08,140
you're finishing and they're finished 
and like a couple minutes behind you and

2073
01:39:08,450 --> 01:39:09,530
you go like,
well,

2074
01:39:09,950 --> 01:39:12,350
I might need to kick in the 
afterburners.

2075
01:39:12,850 --> 01:39:16,550
Is that when you would go to a 
nutritionist or to tighten up your diet?

2076
01:39:16,670 --> 01:39:18,380
Yeah,
I mean there's plenty of people who beat

2077
01:39:18,381 --> 01:39:20,870
me and I,
I'm,

2078
01:39:21,590 --> 01:39:23,900
I'm just trying to work harder,
like train more,

2079
01:39:23,901 --> 01:39:26,450
train better,
get stronger.

2080
01:39:26,451 --> 01:39:30,440
Especially like those core muscles and 
like what kind of exercise do you do for

2081
01:39:30,441 --> 01:39:35,441
your core?
Just like the normal planks and things 

2082
01:39:35,441 --> 01:39:37,610
of that nature and uh,
yeah,

2083
01:39:37,611 --> 01:39:42,611
it doesn't,
that doesn't motivate me to change my 

2084
01:39:42,611 --> 01:39:42,611
diet.
People beating me.

2085
01:39:42,611 --> 01:39:44,650
No,
it would take more than that.

2086
01:39:44,800 --> 01:39:46,240
It just is like,
okay,

2087
01:39:46,241 --> 01:39:51,241
you need to train harder,
you need to like put in more work for 

2088
01:39:51,241 --> 01:39:54,361
this.
But don't you think that the fuel that 

2089
01:39:54,361 --> 01:39:56,311
you use in your body,
obviously me giving you any advice is 

2090
01:39:56,311 --> 01:39:59,461
fucking ridiculous.
But don't you think that the fuel that 

2091
01:39:59,461 --> 01:40:00,580
goes into your body has some sort of an 
effect on your performance?

2092
01:40:00,581 --> 01:40:01,410
I mean,
it must surely

2093
01:40:01,630 --> 01:40:06,630
Shirley,
but I also just want to live life and 

2094
01:40:06,630 --> 01:40:07,090
enjoy it,
you know,

2095
01:40:07,091 --> 01:40:09,550
like I don't want to be counting how 
many Kale

2096
01:40:09,910 --> 01:40:12,970
he says I'm eating.
Well,

2097
01:40:13,020 --> 01:40:14,020
that's a good attitude.
I mean,

2098
01:40:14,080 --> 01:40:19,080
obviously your enthusiasm is a huge part
of your success and your mental state.

2099
01:40:20,500 --> 01:40:25,500
I think it can,
it can be argued at all that that's not 

2100
01:40:25,500 --> 01:40:29,761
a huge part of your success is.
And just to keep enjoying your life in 

2101
01:40:30,801 --> 01:40:34,840
living the way you're living perhaps 
fuels that mental state.

2102
01:40:34,980 --> 01:40:35,910
Yeah,
I mean the,

2103
01:40:35,911 --> 01:40:39,120
I'm thinking they're all intertwined,
but who knows,

2104
01:40:39,121 --> 01:40:44,121
you know,
what thing could be tweaked to make it 

2105
01:40:44,121 --> 01:40:44,121
better?

2106
01:40:44,121 --> 01:40:44,121
Well,
I don't know,

2107
01:40:44,121 --> 01:40:44,280
you know,
I mean,

2108
01:40:44,880 --> 01:40:45,900
it's all that,
uh,

2109
01:40:45,930 --> 01:40:47,950
the Jack Nicholson in the shining,
you know,

2110
01:40:48,030 --> 01:40:50,340
too much work.
No play makes jack a dull boy,

2111
01:40:50,380 --> 01:40:51,230
right?
Yeah.

2112
01:40:51,410 --> 01:40:53,710
Yeah.
Is it John or Jack?

2113
01:40:53,740 --> 01:40:56,860
Who is he in the movie was jacked to 
Johnny.

2114
01:40:57,340 --> 01:40:58,720
Johnny adult boy,
right?

2115
01:40:58,760 --> 01:40:59,910
Yeah.
Here's Johnny.

2116
01:40:59,920 --> 01:41:01,390
That's right.
That's right.

2117
01:41:01,860 --> 01:41:03,130
Yeah.
I mean,

2118
01:41:03,670 --> 01:41:08,670
I wonder if like maybe the,
just the ultimate grind of discipline 

2119
01:41:08,670 --> 01:41:12,840
and no reward is just not.
It's not beneficial to performance that 

2120
01:41:12,840 --> 01:41:15,070
there's some sort of a balance that must
be achieved,

2121
01:41:15,910 --> 01:41:20,910
enjoying yourself and being enthusiastic
and appreciative and also disciplined.

2122
01:41:22,090 --> 01:41:24,310
I think a good balance of all that is 
important.

2123
01:41:25,060 --> 01:41:26,050
We'll listen.
Courtney,

2124
01:41:26,051 --> 01:41:31,051
thank you so much for being here.
You are an inspiration and I'm so blown 

2125
01:41:31,601 --> 01:41:35,020
away by what you've managed to do and I 
can't wait to see what you can do in the

2126
01:41:35,021 --> 01:41:37,000
future and if you really can run 500 
miles,

2127
01:41:37,810 --> 01:41:40,210
if you do 500 miles,
you gotta come back in here.

2128
01:41:40,240 --> 01:41:43,870
We got to talk it out on the course with
the foam finger.

2129
01:41:44,950 --> 01:41:49,950
I'll wear whatever you want.
Chicken outfit like those dudes are so 

2130
01:41:49,950 --> 01:41:50,680
real estate.
Whatever you need.

2131
01:41:51,270 --> 01:41:52,600
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

2132
01:41:52,930 --> 01:41:54,390
And everybody tell people

2133
01:41:54,630 --> 01:41:57,270
get ahold of you on twitter.
It's different than instagram.

2134
01:41:57,550 --> 01:41:59,280
Instagram is courtney dot Walter.

2135
01:41:59,520 --> 01:42:01,140
Instagram is coordinated.
You alter.

2136
01:42:01,230 --> 01:42:06,230
Twitter is court do alter and d a u w a 
l t e r m,

2137
01:42:07,170 --> 01:42:08,870
whoever's got courtney.
Doe,

2138
01:42:08,880 --> 01:42:11,190
Walter on twitter.
Give it up,

2139
01:42:11,191 --> 01:42:12,330
bitch.
Come on.

2140
01:42:12,570 --> 01:42:17,570
That's ridiculous.
Give it to her because they got it 

2141
01:42:17,570 --> 01:42:17,570
right.
Right after you won.

2142
01:42:17,570 --> 01:42:18,150
Right.
That's when they did it.

2143
01:42:18,940 --> 01:42:23,940
Some weird series of events led to a 
twitter being made and they say they 

2144
01:42:23,940 --> 01:42:24,390
were going to give it to you.
They said they were going to give it to.

2145
01:42:25,060 --> 01:42:26,580
Okay.
Make that happen.

2146
01:42:27,690 --> 01:42:28,830
Thank you so much.
Coordination,

2147
01:42:28,831 --> 01:42:29,370
but also.
