1
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:05,670
Oh boy,
here we go again.

2
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:11,060
The Joe Rogan experience podcast is 
brought to you by the fleshlight flush.

3
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:13,300
Yeah.
Great.

4
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:14,460
No,
that's great.

5
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:17,010
It's not.
It's not right.

6
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:20,550
It's more well known than dildos.
There's no like one dildo company that's

7
00:00:20,551 --> 00:00:22,020
known as much as the flashlight is 
known.

8
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:25,180
Right.
You put your wiener in winter.

9
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:29,110
Yes.
Like it's for fucking like it's not.

10
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:29,400
Yeah,
yeah,

11
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:30,030
yeah.
Fuck it.

12
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:31,770
Why?
What's the point of having a light?

13
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:33,090
Oh,
it's not really a light.

14
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:38,370
That was just a job with John half.
Ron had a great joke about it should 

15
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:38,370
have a light because no one ever knows 
where their flashlight in his,

16
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:39,990
but everyone always knows where your 
flashlight is,

17
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:45,410
which is very funny.
It's really and very wood for the folks 

18
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:50,391
on it.
Brian has just pulled the actual 

19
00:00:50,391 --> 00:00:51,270
fleshlight I it at the bucket and you 
pull it out.

20
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:53,490
Blanche opened her mouth and she has 
horrible fish.

21
00:00:53,491 --> 00:00:55,080
Breath.
So the second you did that,

22
00:00:55,081 --> 00:00:59,520
I smell that it was interactive.
Would be a dog who's sitting in her lap.

23
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:02,600
That's blanches a dream.
I guess that's.

24
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:06,230
She can smell anytime.
What I thought it was,

25
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:12,510
this one's a bottle that's really tiny 
out essentially is right.

26
00:01:13,501 --> 00:01:14,690
I mean that's what you're asking for 
sure.

27
00:01:14,691 --> 00:01:16,730
It's the same thing.
I go both ways.

28
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:20,610
It's just the whole.
This is a fake one.

29
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:24,580
Is that defend you when you see like a 
fake vagina to defend me.

30
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:29,630
Some people get offended.
Some girls they don't like because you 

31
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:29,630
should be fucking me instead.
No,

32
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:30,720
it's not.
Some girls,

33
00:01:30,721 --> 00:01:32,340
I'm sure you know,
needy girls.

34
00:01:32,341 --> 00:01:33,800
It probably would think like that.
Right?

35
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:35,670
Don't you have some crazy girls?
Yeah.

36
00:01:35,671 --> 00:01:36,210
Yeah,
for sure.

37
00:01:36,211 --> 00:01:37,620
So you're saying like,
girls are like,

38
00:01:37,621 --> 00:01:38,490
why do you need that?

39
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,660
Yeah,
that's such odd.

40
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:44,400
They can get angry.
You dudes have a.

41
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:45,610
well,
I don't want to ask her boyfriend.

42
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,410
I don't want to ask you if you've ever 
had a sex toy.

43
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:49,290
We want to offer up any information.
Feel free.

44
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:51,330
Ready now go.
I will tell you this.

45
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:56,510
Uh,
I don't prescribe to that ideology 

46
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:57,150
because I feel that it will set you up 
for disappointment.

47
00:01:57,151 --> 00:02:00,960
Like no man is ever going to be able to 
move as rapidly as a vibrator.

48
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,690
So I just completely abstain from that 
and it's fine.

49
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:08,580
I've been given like I'll do shows and 
the vehicle get out free dildos and it's

50
00:02:08,581 --> 00:02:13,581
embarrassing to walk out of there with a
hose and like one time for my birthday a

51
00:02:14,071 --> 00:02:16,750
comic came and he bought like a bag of 
sex toys and you know,

52
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,800
your parents come to visit,
like you don't want that around and I 

53
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:21,800
just don't.

54
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,710
Dude,
I'm with you.

55
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:27,920
I'd rather feel less good most of the 
time to get that added.

56
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:32,970
So it looks like a squid.
Go to Joe Rogan.net.

57
00:02:32,971 --> 00:02:37,971
Click on the link for the fleshlight.
Enter the code name Rogan and you will 

58
00:02:37,971 --> 00:02:37,971
get 15 percent off.
And I'm going.

59
00:02:37,971 --> 00:02:42,960
Sorry Joe,
you know a tip that we've never thought 

60
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:42,960
of it.
You could only have to buy the vagina,

61
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:47,920
a version of the flashlight because the 
other side does have something that 

62
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:48,720
looks like an asshole.
At least an asshole enough that.

63
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:50,610
Yeah.
But it doesn't fit into the thing,

64
00:02:50,611 --> 00:02:55,611
right?
You'd have to have a different sort of 

65
00:02:55,611 --> 00:02:55,611
setup.
Like you can make your own probably.

66
00:02:55,611 --> 00:03:00,330
Yeah.
You'd have to have some sort of a 

67
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:00,330
different face to it.
Yeah.

68
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:00,820
Yeah.
The what you're saying essentially.

69
00:03:00,821 --> 00:03:02,830
I see what you're saying.
What you're saying is it doesn't have to

70
00:03:02,831 --> 00:03:03,670
be one or the other.

71
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:04,720
It should be both.
Yeah.

72
00:03:04,721 --> 00:03:06,130
You should have it on both sides.
Like,

73
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:07,420
like a real woman.
Yeah.

74
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:09,190
You know,
but it would be in a weird.

75
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,680
It's not the same spot.
Like right next to each other.

76
00:03:11,681 --> 00:03:12,590
We didn't only work.
No,

77
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,350
I mean just make a flashlight that 
you're on your.

78
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,050
If you're on your side,
they're next to each other.

79
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:18,550
Yeah.
But not like this.

80
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:21,870
Just make a flashlight that you can fuck
both sides that has caps on both sides.

81
00:03:21,871 --> 00:03:23,010
It just caught like A.
Yeah,

82
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:25,300
my saber instead like a light saber,
you know?

83
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,820
Yeah.
No,

84
00:03:27,821 --> 00:03:30,100
I see what you're saying.
Totally got a good idea.

85
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:31,840
What he's saying is it should be two 
sided,

86
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:36,870
like the butthole should be one option.
Sometimes I feel like sometimes I feel 

87
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:40,471
like a nut.
Sometimes they don't see what you're 

88
00:03:40,471 --> 00:03:40,471
saying.
I feel you.

89
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:41,860
I feel you on this.

90
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:48,020
Would that.
I guess that one would cost more than 

91
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:48,020
um,
yeah,

92
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:51,211
but you know what,
how much more I really want a superior 

93
00:03:51,211 --> 00:03:51,211
product you'd be putting out.
But anyway,

94
00:03:51,211 --> 00:03:52,990
the fleshlight as it stands,
solid product,

95
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,400
Brian and I give it two thumbs up or 
there should be a subscription base,

96
00:03:57,401 --> 00:03:58,880
you know,
like you can just like have it,

97
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:02,230
you get 20 bucks a month,
you can have any flashlight you want and

98
00:04:02,231 --> 00:04:06,020
then when you cancel it you have to send
them all back of legislator.

99
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:11,030
The month club.
Never trust the fact that the one that 

100
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:11,410
you were getting it not been fucked 
already.

101
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,140
The shittiest one and they just sent it 
because it's part,

102
00:04:14,141 --> 00:04:19,141
it's part of a prescription.
I think it should live up to its name 

103
00:04:19,141 --> 00:04:19,490
and like a carnival game.
The hardy.

104
00:04:19,491 --> 00:04:20,950
You fuck it.
The more it lights up.

105
00:04:20,951 --> 00:04:22,630
So you know,
you're doing a good job.

106
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,360
What are we?
Well,

107
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:30,800
we're on such a strong delay.
I'm looking at the image on the screen 

108
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,340
and that's the amazing artwork that 
somebody sent you.

109
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:35,500
Yeah,
I got to get that dude's name.

110
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:41,380
It's so amazing that I just want to 
stare at it all day.

111
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:46,381
That's one of those amazing pieces of 
art that you can sit there and find so 

112
00:04:46,381 --> 00:04:49,390
many things in.
Just random guy's name.

113
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,600
He sent it to my manager.
Just some super cool fan,

114
00:04:52,601 --> 00:04:53,260
dude,
whoever,

115
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,670
whoever you are.
Thank you.

116
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:55,280
Thank you,
sir.

117
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,090
I love what you've done to this.
A studio show.

118
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:01,780
Well,
it's my office man.

119
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:04,890
A studio.
I just threw up some pictures and needed

120
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,850
some,
some life on the walls.

121
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,490
I had accumulated a bunch of cool 
pictures but done nothing with them.

122
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:14,730
And then finally I put them up there.
Just fucking room was like right out of 

123
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:14,890
hoarders.
Now though.

124
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:18,400
It's so crazy.
Shit.

125
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:22,120
It goes above the litter box to be fair.
But it's true.

126
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:25,450
That is one of the components you need.
Yeah.

127
00:05:25,451 --> 00:05:30,451
My cat,
she knows she doesn't really like to be 

128
00:05:30,451 --> 00:05:30,451
anywhere else,
uh,

129
00:05:30,451 --> 00:05:31,030
at night than in my office.

130
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:34,600
And it's like my kids are always 
wandering around the place my kids don't

131
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:37,780
wander around is in my office.
So I figured,

132
00:05:37,781 --> 00:05:42,781
you know what,
I should just keep to her box in my 

133
00:05:42,781 --> 00:05:42,781
office.
Who should bite the bullet?

134
00:05:42,781 --> 00:05:44,890
It's so gross though.
Smelling cat shit all day,

135
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:45,910
dude.
It's gross.

136
00:05:45,911 --> 00:05:50,590
I gotta get in there and open the top 
and scoop it out and flush it and my cat

137
00:05:50,591 --> 00:05:54,060
waits until I'm there to take the nasty 
shit.

138
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:59,430
Like she waits.
I know she does because I'll come home 

139
00:05:59,430 --> 00:05:59,750
and I'm checking my email and I hear 
scratch,

140
00:05:59,751 --> 00:06:00,740
scratch,
scratch them.

141
00:06:00,741 --> 00:06:04,340
Like oh you little bitch.
And she just drops a fucking stinker.

142
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:09,570
I had something worse happened.
Joe Mike had recently was sick and had 

143
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:11,210
like some kind of urinary track 
infection I guess.

144
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:16,230
You know.
So I tried to get a cranberry juice for 

145
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:16,230
awhile,
but nothing.

146
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:16,490
It's hard to give cranberry juice to a 
cad work.

147
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:21,740
Yeah.
It has to be a good news and bad news.

148
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:25,560
Urinary tract infection gone.
But it was trying,

149
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:31,290
it started doing that horrible shit were
just start peeing because it couldn't 

150
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:34,841
control itself and it did it in my bed 
all over my head and Cat pee if you know

151
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:39,860
anything about canopy and NASA.
I haven't looked really nice fucking bed

152
00:06:39,861 --> 00:06:42,800
and now it's just most like happy and 
I've washed it,

153
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,690
scrubbed it.
I can't do anything.

154
00:06:44,691 --> 00:06:49,691
So I'm about to find something that 
smells worse than copy just because I'm 

155
00:06:49,691 --> 00:06:51,830
so sick of that cat pee smell.
It's unfortunate,

156
00:06:51,831 --> 00:06:56,831
but you got to get rid of the mattress,
the mattress that you can get that stuff

157
00:06:57,021 --> 00:06:59,510
that they sell at your in gone.
Yeah.

158
00:06:59,511 --> 00:07:00,980
But it doesn't really work.
You're in,

159
00:07:00,981 --> 00:07:03,410
you're out.
I mean it works a little sort of what it

160
00:07:03,411 --> 00:07:03,680
does.

161
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,780
Is it some sort of citrus base thing?
You know,

162
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:10,580
it breaks down the smell of cat urine to
a certain extent,

163
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:14,270
but it's is like glitter.
That's never gonna go away.

164
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:16,530
When you would go,
I don't know if you,

165
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,680
your grandparents were like mind with 
grandparents.

166
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:23,910
They start shitting in a certain way 
where it really fucking smells awful 

167
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:29,060
like old people.
Shit is like the worst drugs in it.

168
00:07:29,061 --> 00:07:34,061
You think old people shit,
like they're dying probably the diet,

169
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:37,330
not that healthy diet and they're dying.
And um,

170
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,500
uh,
I would go in after my grandfather would

171
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:44,501
take shuts and there would be a spell of
like air freshener in the air that was 

172
00:07:44,501 --> 00:07:48,320
like the most offensive smell.
The air freshener cover up over shit.

173
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:53,930
This shit.
It's just terrible fucking smell.

174
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:56,900
It smells awful.
It's humid,

175
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:01,070
humid smell,
human smell.

176
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:06,680
And we're also sponsored by on it and I 
t.com,

177
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:08,900
makers of Alpha brain,
shroom,

178
00:08:08,901 --> 00:08:09,740
tech,
sport,

179
00:08:09,741 --> 00:08:10,430
shroom,
tech,

180
00:08:10,431 --> 00:08:12,830
immune and a new mood.

181
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:14,930
All these things are different.
Nootropics,

182
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:20,140
nootropics are,
if you're interested in and they're 

183
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:20,140
essentially vitamins and nutrients for 
your brain.

184
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:23,090
I really believe in them.
I know they work.

185
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:23,930
Um,
you know,

186
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:27,020
there's scientific studies that we're 
going to do right now.

187
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:32,050
There's gonna be some.
We already discussed this was a double 

188
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:32,050
blind,
placebo,

189
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:32,050
double blind,
whatever it means.

190
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:37,000
The most stringent scientific tests they
can for figuring out whether or not 

191
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,870
people's performances are improved with 
their mood's improved.

192
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:40,250
They're not going to know what they're 
taking.

193
00:08:40,251 --> 00:08:45,251
Some people will take a placebo,
some people will take a combination of 

194
00:08:45,251 --> 00:08:45,890
different things.
Some people will take Alpha brain on its

195
00:08:45,891 --> 00:08:48,340
own and we'll see what the results are.
I,

196
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:50,540
I have been taking nootropics for a long
time.

197
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:52,250
If you're interested in it before you 
buy anything,

198
00:08:52,251 --> 00:08:54,050
just google it,
just google the idea.

199
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:59,330
Uh,
there's a lot of really fascinating 

200
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:02,240
papers and different things that have 
been written on them and there's proof 

201
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,390
that some of them actually can help 
people with Alzheimer's.

202
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:07,500
It's really their nutrients for the way 
your mind functions couldn't hurt.

203
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:14,550
But yeah,
you're not supposed to take five htp if 

204
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:14,820
you're on antidepressants.
Well,

205
00:09:14,821 --> 00:09:17,100
those people are ridiculous 
antidepressants.

206
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:21,570
Totally thought you were just going to 
make the best show ever.

207
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:25,890
Is there a reason why they decided 
against the triple blind?

208
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:31,130
They just don't want to know.
What that means is there is a triple 

209
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:33,270
blind as to blinds enough.
You greedy bitch.

210
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,790
Just do it.
As always say,

211
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:39,430
look,
I,

212
00:09:39,431 --> 00:09:40,860
I take all this stuff.
There's shroom,

213
00:09:40,861 --> 00:09:41,490
tech,
immune.

214
00:09:41,491 --> 00:09:43,950
It's great for your immune system that 
actually somehow or another,

215
00:09:43,951 --> 00:09:48,951
it's a mushroom that tricks your body 
into thinking that it's a potentially 

216
00:09:48,951 --> 00:09:49,860
like a bug,
like a cold,

217
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:52,980
and so your immune system fires up for a
fight that never takes place.

218
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:53,850
Uh,
so it's,

219
00:09:53,851 --> 00:09:54,260
uh,
it's uh,

220
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:59,360
like a,
an immune system booster and probiotics 

221
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,631
is something that we don't sell,
but that's one of the things that I 

222
00:10:02,631 --> 00:10:04,491
really recommend if you,
if you're a person who really cares 

223
00:10:04,491 --> 00:10:07,311
about your health,
one of the cool things you can do is 

224
00:10:07,311 --> 00:10:08,640
enhance your health with organisms,
live organisms,

225
00:10:08,641 --> 00:10:11,130
probiotics,
and Kombucha tea.

226
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:12,710
I'm a big believer in that,
that,

227
00:10:12,711 --> 00:10:15,030
that stuff is excellent.
Keep you from getting sick.

228
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,410
I mean,
it really,

229
00:10:16,411 --> 00:10:21,411
I,
it gives me an enhanced feeling of 

230
00:10:21,411 --> 00:10:23,571
wellness.
It's like taking in like healthy 

231
00:10:23,571 --> 00:10:23,571
soldiers.
I also take acidophilus.

232
00:10:23,571 --> 00:10:24,650
No,
I think if,

233
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:26,340
yeah,
I get it and get the good stuff.

234
00:10:26,341 --> 00:10:29,190
Get the stuff that you need to 
refrigerate the real live culture.

235
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,250
It's fucking great for you.
Kay.

236
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:37,370
I love Kayla.
Drink Kale shakes every day so high 

237
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:38,940
right now.
Good for grass would be healthy.

238
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:40,690
No,
but wheat grass juice is healthy.

239
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,010
Chlorophylls very healthy taste like 
shit,

240
00:10:44,011 --> 00:10:45,300
but it's very healthy.
There's nothing.

241
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:51,470
Well,
there's chlorophyll and glass and grass 

242
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:51,470
rather chlorophyll.
Yeah.

243
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:51,950
You fill in all plants.
There's.

244
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:56,970
Yeah.
There's a bunch of different types of 

245
00:10:56,970 --> 00:10:56,970
grasses.
You know,

246
00:10:56,970 --> 00:10:59,780
I don't know what grass specific list.
What if we were designed to only eat 

247
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:04,281
grass grass,
we wouldn't have these pointy teeth.

248
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:11,210
Well,
maybe that was for like digging big 

249
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:13,500
things out of the ground compared to 
other animals.

250
00:11:13,981 --> 00:11:17,490
We have the most bitch ass teeth ever.
Nothing.

251
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,180
They're like these little fragile flat 
things.

252
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:25,770
They're designed to chew mushy food.
I mean how we eat other animals that are

253
00:11:25,771 --> 00:11:28,590
designed to actually hold onto things 
and then eat those things,

254
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:31,160
tear them apart and eat them.
And if you look at like a,

255
00:11:31,161 --> 00:11:34,620
a champs teeth compared to our teeth,
they're designed to fuck you up.

256
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:37,680
Designed to fuck you up because I always
look at blanches mouth.

257
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:41,860
Even like when she's sleeping you,
when you live with an animal.

258
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:44,670
I live with a tiny carnivore,
right?

259
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:50,490
Carrots and she's sweet,
but like genetically programmed to like 

260
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:52,230
find live things and rip their necks in 
half and eat them.

261
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,650
Yeah.
It's weird,

262
00:11:53,651 --> 00:11:53,810
right?

263
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:57,940
Even though she's a little love bug.
Anyway,

264
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,670
go on and talk dog o n n I t dot Com.

265
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:03,150
We tried to make your mattress.
Yeah.

266
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,330
Camera.
You master's son.

267
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:09,700
Can't fucking.
You know Joe,

268
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:12,670
I put two comforters on.
Enjoy it all.

269
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:17,690
Smells.
It was awesome.

270
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:21,270
Here's why you have to get rid of.
Let's get rid of this commercial.

271
00:12:21,271 --> 00:12:23,340
Let's get this commercial though,
right when we started this podcast,

272
00:12:23,341 --> 00:12:24,830
I know this is going to be.
No,

273
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:29,990
we haven't even started your whole week.
Grass truck.

274
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:35,430
Anyway.
We have for the first 30 pills,

275
00:12:35,431 --> 00:12:36,030
whatever you buy,

276
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:38,240
we offer 100 percent money back 
guarantee.

277
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:43,270
It used to be whatever you buy,
we offered a 100 percent money back 

278
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:43,640
guarantee,
but there's some douche bags that bought

279
00:12:43,641 --> 00:12:47,540
a bunch and then try to sell them on 
Ebay after they got their money back,

280
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:50,690
which you ruined it.
That's human nature,

281
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:54,680
but we try to make this as easy and as 
clean as possible.

282
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:57,350
One hundred percent money back guarantee
and your first 30 pills,

283
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:00,530
and you know what?
If you think it costs too much money,

284
00:13:00,531 --> 00:13:03,770
I urge you,
go and buy the ingredients,

285
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:08,830
take the directions offline,
whatever the ingredients are clearly 

286
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:13,361
listed on the website,
on it dot come and steal it and make 

287
00:13:13,361 --> 00:13:15,140
your own blend.
Who cares just if you're into it,

288
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:16,490
try it.
Check it out,

289
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:19,410
and if you want to buy them from us,
go to Joe Rogan,

290
00:13:19,411 --> 00:13:24,411
not net.
Click on the link for Alpha brain and 

291
00:13:24,411 --> 00:13:24,411
entering the code name,
Rogan,

292
00:13:24,411 --> 00:13:24,411
and you get 10 percent off.
Okay?

293
00:13:24,411 --> 00:13:26,030
You'd already freaks done.
See,

294
00:13:26,031 --> 00:13:28,100
that's the Commercial Eliza.
It's over now.

295
00:13:28,101 --> 00:13:28,790
We play music,

296
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:34,990
so that was good podcast.
That's the best way for us to do 

297
00:13:37,491 --> 00:13:42,491
commercials.
We have figured out was I in that 

298
00:13:42,491 --> 00:13:42,491
commercial?

299
00:13:42,491 --> 00:13:42,491
Okay,
dude,

300
00:13:42,491 --> 00:13:45,660
you are fucking awesome.
And it was one of your best,

301
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:50,730
best pieces.
I'm going to submit that to the tonight 

302
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:50,730
show.
You could do that.

303
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:52,090
I bet it's a solid piece.
Yeah,

304
00:13:52,091 --> 00:13:54,310
it was a solid piece.
Give it a rush.

305
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:59,550
Eliza,
live slessinger professional stand up 

306
00:13:59,550 --> 00:13:59,550
comedian.
Yeah.

307
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:01,300
We all share a comradery.
You know,

308
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:03,410
it's funny comics,
you know,

309
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:04,960
like when you meet someone that's a 
comic,

310
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:09,040
we all share this kind of weird thing 
like I did the Rosie O'donnell show.

311
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:10,770
Yeah.
People are like,

312
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:12,010
why do you want to do Rosie O'donnell 
show?

313
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:12,970
And I'd be like,
[inaudible],

314
00:14:12,971 --> 00:14:14,740
she's a comic.
You know what I mean?

315
00:14:14,741 --> 00:14:17,710
Like we all share,
we share something.

316
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,330
Tell us about that.
What was that like?

317
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:21,670
She was very nice.
I haven't got to talk to her for a short

318
00:14:21,671 --> 00:14:23,010
period of time.
We had a,

319
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:26,110
we sat down for about an hour and we 
talked about,

320
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:27,610
she talked a little bit about the 
government.

321
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:30,820
She had a really good point about how 
people look at the government.

322
00:14:30,821 --> 00:14:34,230
Like it's a benevolent father and I,
I absolutely agree with that.

323
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:35,560
Agree with that.
Yeah.

324
00:14:35,561 --> 00:14:36,730
And she was,
you know,

325
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:37,750
she's like,
really?

326
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:40,600
She stuck her neck out and she was on 
that show.

327
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:41,290
Like a chicken

328
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:45,430
view.
Yeah.

329
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:46,390
Well she got,
she got it.

330
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:46,640
Trumbull

331
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:47,670
and the view.
I mean,

332
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:51,060
I'm sorry she got in trouble in the view
because she was um,

333
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,130
she was talking

334
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:57,130
about nine slash 11 and she was talking 
about tower seven and if you don't know 

335
00:14:57,130 --> 00:15:01,091
this,
there's three towers fell on September 

336
00:15:01,091 --> 00:15:01,250
11 and two of them obviously I got hit 
by planes,

337
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:06,430
but one of them went down,
one of them just went down and there's 

338
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:08,120
the crazy conspiracy theories that say 
that it was a controlled demolition.

339
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:11,930
Now I am the first person to tell you I 
am no engineer.

340
00:15:11,931 --> 00:15:16,040
I have no idea how buildings are built 
or what their tolerances are.

341
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:18,770
But if I saw a building like that and I,
you know,

342
00:15:18,771 --> 00:15:21,080
I saw just catch on fire and it had some
holes in it and shit,

343
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:23,850
but it just felt like that black bitch 
apps,

344
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:26,840
you build this,
how the fuck did you build this?

345
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:28,160
You know,
come on man.

346
00:15:28,161 --> 00:15:32,060
Really is what kind of Shitty work is 
designed to go down.

347
00:15:32,061 --> 00:15:33,560
Like it was,
it was saying it was.

348
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:36,440
A lot of people believe it's a 
controlled demolition.

349
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:39,440
I don't think necessarily she is saying 
that it is or it isn't.

350
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:41,990
And I certainly am not.
I don't know.

351
00:15:41,991 --> 00:15:43,800
I don't understand that.
You know what I believe more.

352
00:15:43,801 --> 00:15:45,620
It was a controlled demolition.
Yes.

353
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:47,420
But with a by us.
Yes.

354
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:48,080
No.
Yeah,

355
00:15:48,081 --> 00:15:53,081
I mean,
I think that's always been the case of 

356
00:15:53,081 --> 00:15:53,081
the,
the argument.

357
00:15:53,081 --> 00:15:53,081
They don't think it was done by the 
terrorists.

358
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:56,140
They think let me know.
No building the tear.

359
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:56,590
What?
No.

360
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,560
What if the terrorists,
uh Oh,

361
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:03,620
they did a controlled demolition.
It wasn't like if somehow they had tea 

362
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:08,050
because I probably could easily.
I think that would probably be before 

363
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:11,390
hijacking planes and flying them into 
buildings before that would be putting a

364
00:16:11,391 --> 00:16:14,270
bomb in a building.
But it's not that easy.

365
00:16:14,271 --> 00:16:19,271
See,
like when you see what happened in 

366
00:16:19,271 --> 00:16:19,580
Oklahoma City that was multiple bombs,
you know,

367
00:16:19,581 --> 00:16:20,960
in Oklahoma City,
they actually,

368
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:25,990
there was all these reports of the FBI 
removing bombs from the building like 

369
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:26,840
that didn't explode.

370
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:29,630
And if you talk to these guys that are 
demolition experts,

371
00:16:29,631 --> 00:16:31,820
they say there's no way that was a 
fertilizer bomb.

372
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,610
There's no fucking way.
They said that.

373
00:16:34,611 --> 00:16:39,611
If you look at the amount of damage that
did and look at where the blast radius 

374
00:16:39,611 --> 00:16:42,560
is from the way it blows out,
it doesn't blow the.

375
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:45,350
They're not designed to.
You're saying spelling because we've all

376
00:16:45,351 --> 00:16:50,351
seen the loose change where you watch 
the lights go off around the building 

377
00:16:50,351 --> 00:16:51,400
one floor by one.
It's like,

378
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:54,260
yeah,
but see they don't see.

379
00:16:54,261 --> 00:16:56,990
They don't know what that means though.
That also could be.

380
00:16:56,991 --> 00:17:01,040
If the ceiling is coming in and slamming
into the floor,

381
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:05,030
all the windows would do that.
They don't know that that's explosions.

382
00:17:05,031 --> 00:17:10,031
If it really was collapsing like that.
See no one's ever seen a building 

383
00:17:10,031 --> 00:17:14,141
collapsed like that.
So when they say that those are blips 

384
00:17:14,141 --> 00:17:17,021
and those are squibs,
I don't like that because then I'm 

385
00:17:17,021 --> 00:17:17,021
saying you're.

386
00:17:17,021 --> 00:17:18,230
You're saying you know for sure what 
that is and I'm saying the fuck you do.

387
00:17:18,231 --> 00:17:19,720
I don't know.
Even the.

388
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:24,770
Someone's got an.
There's just because someone has to 

389
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:24,770
know.
I'm not saying it was as.

390
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:26,450
I'm not saying it was an inside job.
It just seems odd ergonomically that you

391
00:17:26,451 --> 00:17:28,990
would design a building that if 
impacted.

392
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:34,000
At a certain point,
the entire thing would demolish what 

393
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:34,400
structurally?
What purpose does that serve?

394
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:34,700
Well,
the.

395
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,260
Yeah,
the weird.

396
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,850
Well,
it could just be in competence.

397
00:17:37,851 --> 00:17:39,470
That's possible.
If you look at humans,

398
00:17:39,471 --> 00:17:40,970
that's our most likely option,
right?

399
00:17:40,971 --> 00:17:45,971
I mean when did they make the world 
trade center so fucking long ass time 

400
00:17:45,971 --> 00:17:48,080
ago to get so cocky to build a building 
that's 100 God damn stories high.

401
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:50,060
And how long did they think that was 
good?

402
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:51,820
Stay up there for,
you know,

403
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:53,830
what if it started falling apart or 
rotting what it was,

404
00:17:53,831 --> 00:17:56,710
it was just a,
just a wonky piece of shit by the time I

405
00:17:56,711 --> 00:17:57,720
got hit by those planes.

406
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,010
Yeah,
that's totally true.

407
00:17:59,011 --> 00:18:00,930
I mean it's fucking thing was oldest 
shit.

408
00:18:00,931 --> 00:18:02,970
That thing was around as black and white
television.

409
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,570
Jessica Lange,
King Kong.

410
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:06,630
I mean.
Yeah,

411
00:18:06,631 --> 00:18:11,631
but what's retrofit?
It's the cheapest goddamn floor and the 

412
00:18:11,631 --> 00:18:11,631
cheapest guy.
A bitter,

413
00:18:11,631 --> 00:18:16,480
you know,
that tells you that how many floors was 

414
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,490
fitted with bombs maybe.
Well that's the crazy idea.

415
00:18:17,491 --> 00:18:19,680
What W,
what we're saying about a building seven

416
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:24,681
or,
or the other building that terrorists 

417
00:18:24,681 --> 00:18:24,681
could have done it.
I mean,

418
00:18:24,681 --> 00:18:27,240
I guess they could have,
but how the fuck are they going to get 

419
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:27,240
in there and put all those explosives 
in?

420
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,580
It's dynamite a time.
Red Sticks of dynamite.

421
00:18:29,581 --> 00:18:32,850
One up your ass.
You're working the fucking thing.

422
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:37,970
Five years everyday.
You're fucking putting it into this 

423
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:37,970
closet.
So funny.

424
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:42,870
Back then they didn't have security that
sticks.

425
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:45,270
You're walking down the hallway and you 
just smell shit.

426
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:48,320
Open this door.
What's in this smells like shit and it's

427
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:50,160
just shitty dynamite state.

428
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:57,580
It's like a fucking log house built with
shit and dynamite sticks and little 

429
00:18:58,501 --> 00:19:00,510
hairs.
A pee mattress.

430
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:06,200
The idea was that know that somebody had
to do something in Oklahoma City on the 

431
00:19:07,411 --> 00:19:08,380
view.
Well,

432
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:11,790
what she said on the view was it was the
only building in history that never.

433
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:16,190
That collapsed skyscraper that wasn't 
hit by a plane and she's.

434
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:17,170
She's true.
No,

435
00:19:17,171 --> 00:19:17,360
no,
no.

436
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:19,210
It wasn't.
Yeah,

437
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:24,220
and it was the only building in history,
a skyscraper of its kind that fell from 

438
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:28,101
a fire and she's right.
I don't know if it needs anything 

439
00:19:28,101 --> 00:19:28,101
though.
Could could be incompetence.

440
00:19:28,101 --> 00:19:32,540
It could be just some crazy coincidence 
that it actually did fall apart like a 

441
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:37,011
controlled demolition,
even though it wasn't a controlled 

442
00:19:37,011 --> 00:19:37,011
demolition.
It could be.

443
00:19:37,011 --> 00:19:37,011
I don't know,
man.

444
00:19:37,011 --> 00:19:41,391
I think there's so much chaos involved 
in any sort of catastrophic situation 

445
00:19:41,391 --> 00:19:43,950
like that and all these reports we heard
explosions in the building.

446
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:46,080
Are you.
Do you really remember what you saw?

447
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:47,880
For sure.
How much.

448
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:51,040
You know what I mean?
So a lot of nuttiness going on when,

449
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:53,550
when right after something like that 
happens,

450
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:56,120
you might want to remember something 
from before you might.

451
00:19:56,130 --> 00:20:00,450
You must be so jolted from that sort of 
a situation that after it's over,

452
00:20:00,451 --> 00:20:00,990
you know,
I,

453
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:05,991
I would,
I would imagine there would be several 

454
00:20:05,991 --> 00:20:05,991
people that would have distorted 
perceptions.

455
00:20:05,991 --> 00:20:09,750
I do not believe that everyone can 
handle truly traumatic incidents.

456
00:20:09,751 --> 00:20:11,490
I'm not claiming and I can more than 
other people,

457
00:20:11,491 --> 00:20:12,420
but I,
I,

458
00:20:12,421 --> 00:20:17,421
I don't think most people can handle 
like really crazy shit going down and 

459
00:20:17,421 --> 00:20:20,860
you can't trust a few people's memories.
Where were we?

460
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:24,630
You got to take it into consideration,
but you can't totally trust it.

461
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:29,640
I think you know,
the amount of trauma that contributes to

462
00:20:29,641 --> 00:20:32,430
a confabulation about whether you saw 
something or not.

463
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,560
I mean,
you can take those reports all day and I

464
00:20:34,561 --> 00:20:37,380
think there's that mob mentality like I 
heard sounds.

465
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:38,400
Oh,
so did I.

466
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:43,660
You know,
what creeps me out with always with 

467
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:44,460
American people out and this is how you 
get minor conspiracy theorists.

468
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:48,340
Not even sure if I am one is when there 
is no explanation by

469
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:51,610
your all powerful government and that's 
what leads people to think,

470
00:20:51,611 --> 00:20:56,611
oh,
the government was in on it because 

471
00:20:56,611 --> 00:20:57,901
you're like,
you're supposed to be the American 

472
00:20:57,901 --> 00:20:57,901
government and you don't have an idea 
how this happened.

473
00:20:57,901 --> 00:20:59,770
That's when people start to feel unsafe 
and get nervous.

474
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:04,330
When they had bin Laden.
You didn't take any pictures.

475
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:05,800
Really.
Not One.

476
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:09,220
I believe they caught him.
It's just odd when there's no answers.

477
00:21:09,221 --> 00:21:10,210
They're like,
we're not sure.

478
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:11,890
JFK.
That's a weird thing.

479
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:14,920
Like how do you not have an answer?
I've talked to military people,

480
00:21:14,921 --> 00:21:19,921
just straight up military people about 
the Osama bin Laden thing and every one 

481
00:21:19,921 --> 00:21:22,090
of them has said that guy was dead for 
years.

482
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:29,710
Every one of them,
I have a couple people that were 

483
00:21:29,861 --> 00:21:34,861
skeptical.
I bet that where you would have valued 

484
00:21:34,861 --> 00:21:34,861
their opinion,
you know,

485
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:36,490
I bet they fucking tortured him.
And,

486
00:21:36,491 --> 00:21:40,930
and for years people telling dudes,
man,

487
00:21:40,931 --> 00:21:43,840
right wing straight lace.
That wasn't the war.

488
00:21:43,841 --> 00:21:46,600
Military guys there.
And they're like,

489
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:49,080
that guy's been dead for years.
I bet his own pee.

490
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:50,890
I mean I don't,
I don't think they're scaled.

491
00:21:50,891 --> 00:21:53,290
I think you've just because you have put
a couple of bombs somewhere.

492
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:58,291
These are not,
they're not using like biophysics to 

493
00:21:58,291 --> 00:22:01,141
kill anyone.
So I think his own probably friendly 

494
00:22:01,141 --> 00:22:01,180
fire probably blew himself up on fucking
accident.

495
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:06,540
They might've just fucking crashed one 
of their helicopters and this was their 

496
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:06,910
crazy cover story.
They might have fucked up,

497
00:22:06,911 --> 00:22:09,580
crashed when their helicopters and goes,
listen boys,

498
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:11,860
you see lemons,
ice lemonade.

499
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:17,210
Here's a story.
Crashed a helicopter because we killed 

500
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:17,410
Osama bin Ladin.

501
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:18,440
Yeah,
yeah,

502
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:20,320
yeah.
We lost a billion dollar helicopter.

503
00:22:20,321 --> 00:22:21,490
Whatever,
whatever.

504
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:23,440
We're going to blow that up.
It doesn't matter.

505
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:26,560
Brave soldiers survived that crash.
We got it.

506
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:28,060
We got them.
We got them.

507
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,100
We got only dumped him and see we dumped
them.

508
00:22:30,101 --> 00:22:31,480
It's because we do want to make them 
harder.

509
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:34,800
What are you talking about?
You're telling everybody you shot him.

510
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:40,100
It's just an it in visual form.
It's not the same as you fucking 

511
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:44,041
admitting it with your mouth.
The president getting on TV with his 

512
00:22:44,041 --> 00:22:45,520
fucking mouth and admitting it 
seriously.

513
00:22:45,521 --> 00:22:47,590
He's looking at the camera and he's 
saying it.

514
00:22:47,591 --> 00:22:50,980
We killed ourselves like we.
That doesn't make him a martyr woody.

515
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:55,990
You have to.
There has to be a visual representation 

516
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:58,531
of it.
That would be something I would have 

517
00:22:58,531 --> 00:22:58,630
liked to have seen footage like his face
would you have for us,

518
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:00,160
but not for them.

519
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:05,280
Them saying that they're excuse,
that they don't want them to be a 

520
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,801
martyr.
Then why the fuck are you admitting you 

521
00:23:07,801 --> 00:23:09,661
killed him on TV?
Why are you getting there wasn't a 

522
00:23:09,661 --> 00:23:12,751
Martin.
They didn't want the reason they didn't 

523
00:23:12,751 --> 00:23:14,340
bury him or do anything.
They didn't want them to be a site that 

524
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:16,501
people could go to,
but the reason why they didn't show any 

525
00:23:16,501 --> 00:23:16,501
photos is because they didn't want them 
to be a martyr as well.

526
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:21,960
I think that's because they don't have 
any photos that epic would it have been 

527
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,530
if Barack Obama,
he's like,

528
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:25,590
we've captured and killed Osama bin 
Ladin,

529
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:30,130
but before we did our gis,
each had a turn fucking him in the mouth

530
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:34,960
and thanks to flip cam,
we have it all on our youtube page.

531
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:38,480
Fuck some crazy old terrorists in the 
mouth.

532
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:43,120
Very soft.
I thought guys like to do that.

533
00:23:43,121 --> 00:23:48,121
You know?
It was so disturbing seeing that other 

534
00:23:48,121 --> 00:23:48,121
guy get captured

535
00:23:48,121 --> 00:23:50,990
and dragged through the streets and 
fucked in the ass Kadafi.

536
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:54,050
That was so fucked up.
I am good as a stick apparently.

537
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:54,640
Oh,
was the.

538
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:59,540
I did something for that kind of stuff.
Like if there were a picture we wouldn't

539
00:23:59,541 --> 00:24:00,230
have shown.
We're not.

540
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:03,770
We don't show graphic things like that 
and our people don't like to see that.

541
00:24:03,771 --> 00:24:06,680
We don't like to see death.
We like people to die and so on.

542
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:10,220
We want to completely lose.
I don't want to see it ever again.

543
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:11,040
Well,
you can.

544
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:16,080
You know,
the real problem is you get access to 

545
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:16,670
something really shocking.
That's not really happening.

546
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:22,180
So you,
when you in watching anybody get 

547
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:22,180
murdered,
watching anybody get fucked up,

548
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:22,910
you have access to something life 
changing,

549
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:28,150
but you're not really there.
That's weird when you can just access 

550
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:30,941
that all the time because then you're 
getting influenced by far more than you 

551
00:24:30,941 --> 00:24:31,290
would in a normal life where you 
actually survive.

552
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:35,000
Also desensitizes us as a country.
We're desensitized to war.

553
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,890
We have all of our video games,
all of our media,

554
00:24:36,891 --> 00:24:37,970
all this stuff.
We're like war.

555
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:40,920
Very few of us have actually will call 
upper class,

556
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:45,970
upper middle class have actually been 
made privy to anything tangentially 

557
00:24:46,971 --> 00:24:49,220
related to war.
And so it's very easy to be like,

558
00:24:49,221 --> 00:24:54,221
yeah,
we'll just send some troops and I've 

559
00:24:54,221 --> 00:24:54,800
been to Israel just on vacation and it's
so fucking hot.

560
00:24:54,801 --> 00:24:59,801
I couldn't stand it.
So just imagine being over there like 

561
00:24:59,801 --> 00:25:02,390
with all like we have no frame of 
reference because we're so desensitized 

562
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:03,710
were detached from it.
They don't.

563
00:25:03,711 --> 00:25:08,711
It's not a part of our daily lives 
unless you have friends and loved ones 

564
00:25:08,711 --> 00:25:08,711
over there,
you know,

565
00:25:08,711 --> 00:25:13,050
watched something on tv or where they're
talking about the amount of money that 

566
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:16,031
it caused to air condition.
The tense and Afghanistan is fucking 

567
00:25:16,031 --> 00:25:18,260
crazy in Iraq and some insane about it.

568
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:20,570
It's like billions of dollars in a 
woman.

569
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:23,020
It's so crazy to keep the AC on.
Yeah,

570
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:26,180
they're just leading.
The whole thing is nuts.

571
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:29,030
It's fucking nuts.
It's nuts that they talk people into it.

572
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:33,800
It's nuts.
It's still going on to send troops over.

573
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:37,430
We're living in a Gi joe movie.
That's what it is.

574
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:42,460
He will even think about it.
I get goosebumps thinking about it at 

575
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:45,101
all.
I don't know why it resonates so deeply 

576
00:25:45,101 --> 00:25:45,101
with me to think about our troops over 
there.

577
00:25:45,101 --> 00:25:49,421
I think because you're smart.
I love my country so much that I just 

578
00:25:49,421 --> 00:25:53,501
want like,
I just love my country and anything 

579
00:25:53,501 --> 00:25:53,501
having to do with that.
Look at this.

580
00:25:53,501 --> 00:25:55,040
It's all standing on all my.
I to be in a patriotic commercial.

581
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:58,850
Do you drive a chevy truck,
a blazer?

582
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,520
Everyone thought I was a lesbian for the
longest time.

583
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:04,610
He plays it for 10 years.

584
00:26:04,610 --> 00:26:05,750
I drove it out here.
Look,

585
00:26:05,751 --> 00:26:06,400
I think,
uh,

586
00:26:06,401 --> 00:26:08,390
the idea of what America is supposed to 
be.

587
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:09,590
This is awesome.
You know,

588
00:26:09,591 --> 00:26:11,660
I think there's a lot of fucking 
creative people here.

589
00:26:11,661 --> 00:26:13,730
A lot of cool people come from America 
for sure.

590
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:16,160
But there's also a lot of clients,
you know,

591
00:26:16,161 --> 00:26:17,930
that,
that represents America as well.

592
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:19,370
Unfortunately,
you know,

593
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:23,840
we're doing the shit that we do around 
the world.

594
00:26:23,841 --> 00:26:28,841
It's just creepy as fuck.
But we also do great things in life,

595
00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:32,010
better for us to be on top.
And then some,

596
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:34,690
some wacky countries.
Right?

597
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:36,470
And we're.
The only ones will take your land.

598
00:26:36,471 --> 00:26:37,490
We'll give it back.
We'll say,

599
00:26:37,491 --> 00:26:38,750
sorry,
we'll make reparations.

600
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:43,800
We were the only ones with a real 
conscious about the Indians.

601
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:44,100
We

602
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:46,790
give land back to American Indians.
Gave him some,

603
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:50,200
given the shittiest spots where there's 
no deer like Vegas go.

604
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:51,450
Yeah.
You want to open a casino?

605
00:26:51,451 --> 00:26:53,550
Go ahead whenever you want to hear 
anymore.

606
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:56,790
They have seven,
11 different Indian.

607
00:26:57,620 --> 00:27:00,810
I'm saying like they have convenient.
They can go eat at a restaurant.

608
00:27:00,811 --> 00:27:02,680
You don't need to worry about.
Well,

609
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:06,210
I mean people who go like what we did to
the Indians and I'm like,

610
00:27:06,211 --> 00:27:07,460
Oh man,
I wasn't what?

611
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:08,460
Yeah,
we weren't here.

612
00:27:08,461 --> 00:27:13,461
So at one point in time does the current
living humans who I know they've 

613
00:27:13,461 --> 00:27:14,940
benefited from the shitty work of the 
past,

614
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,440
I just trust Indians.
Marianna,

615
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:19,230
you trust them on.
It seemed more like down to what I would

616
00:27:19,231 --> 00:27:21,930
like to hang out with Indians or pirate 
pirate guys,

617
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:27,110
Indiana,
new inspiring farriers.

618
00:27:28,290 --> 00:27:32,640
Have you seen the Jesus Western sky 
commercials.

619
00:27:32,641 --> 00:27:35,040
It's like one of those things where it 
gives you money before your payday.

620
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:37,200
Western sky.
It's like a,

621
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:41,200
it's like a check cashing and it's got 
this like Indian drum.

622
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:46,201
It's like dude.
And this girl that looks like an Indian 

623
00:27:46,201 --> 00:27:46,201
native American,
Gina,

624
00:27:46,201 --> 00:27:46,860
go sean with a braid so you know,
she's native,

625
00:27:46,861 --> 00:27:49,710
she's like Western sky,
we'll get you off the payday track,

626
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:53,370
get off the payday trail western.
And it's so fucking intimidating.

627
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:54,990
And she's like,
sure it's expensive,

628
00:27:54,991 --> 00:27:56,130
but it's worth it.
And I'm like,

629
00:27:56,131 --> 00:27:58,230
this is the representative for your 
people.

630
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:01,140
Some fucking creepy.
The Indians expensive.

631
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:06,160
He says that.
So they take like a certain percentage 

632
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:06,870
of your check in order to catch it early
of your soul.

633
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:09,630
That's like they're into that.
I don't know.

634
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:14,270
There's actually been some talk that 
they're going to release the photos of a

635
00:28:14,290 --> 00:28:16,170
Sama bin Ladin and it's.
Yeah.

636
00:28:16,171 --> 00:28:21,171
And it's like so awesome.
Because I'm thinking like how long did 

637
00:28:21,171 --> 00:28:21,171
it take to make Avatar?

638
00:28:21,171 --> 00:28:21,810
Okay,
this is not the same time.

639
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:25,350
They've probably got some better 
technology that Pixar probably has.

640
00:28:25,351 --> 00:28:28,410
Like we have this whole vip section that
we don't talk funny.

641
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:33,920
Could you imagine if one day there's 
cameras that don't just capture a two d 

642
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:38,091
version of what you're saying,
but somehow or another they figure out 

643
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:40,410
some sort of a camera that can actually 
capture three dimensional video that you

644
00:28:40,411 --> 00:28:43,650
can walk around inside.
It'll create holograms,

645
00:28:43,651 --> 00:28:48,651
like really potent holograms.
So you could actually be there standing 

646
00:28:48,651 --> 00:28:53,151
right there next to the troops.
Why they killed Osama bin Ladin press 

647
00:28:53,151 --> 00:28:53,510
play.
Yeah.

648
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:54,540
You know,
that's,

649
00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:57,360
that's entirely within the realm of 
possibility.

650
00:28:57,361 --> 00:28:59,160
If we can create what we can create 
right now,

651
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:04,310
I know it's way more complex,
but it's what we're doing right now is 

652
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:05,520
already impossible to us.
You know,

653
00:29:05,521 --> 00:29:10,521
I don't see any reason why they can't 
come up with some really intense high 

654
00:29:10,771 --> 00:29:15,771
definition hologram type shit and the 
financial reality where you can walk 

655
00:29:15,771 --> 00:29:19,461
around in the scene like you can 
actually probably do.

656
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:22,790
I think American.
No,

657
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:24,240
fuck.
They would line up for that.

658
00:29:24,241 --> 00:29:26,170
Just keep that in Tennessee somewhere.
Yeah.

659
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:30,320
It's like call of duty,
but with stopping.

660
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:36,760
Do you ever been in places like 
Tennessee or West Virginia and I spent 

661
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:37,890
Christmas in Virginia,
Virginia,

662
00:29:37,891 --> 00:29:39,300
Virginia,
backwoods Virginia.

663
00:29:39,330 --> 00:29:41,800
Whoa.
What are you doing having Christmas?

664
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:44,490
Do you know somebody?
That's great.

665
00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:50,500
Do you have a friend from there?
What was that like?

666
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:54,760
Oh my God.
I went to the APA Maddix Maddix.

667
00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:57,430
What's in that courthouse?
Like the civil war.

668
00:29:57,431 --> 00:30:00,820
It's like this tiny went to a civil war 
gift shop,

669
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:06,420
which is not really civil war gift shop 
as much as this dude just ordered a 

670
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:06,420
bunch of shit with confederate flags on 
it.

671
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:08,890
So you have like a bathing suit or 
whatever.

672
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:13,920
Homework.
It's really like all small towns in 

673
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:14,050
America are the same.
The more southern you get,

674
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:19,350
the less teeth,
but for the most part most of America 

675
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:21,631
looks the same and amazing that there's 
some assholes out there that are still 

676
00:30:21,631 --> 00:30:24,310
fighting that war.
What does it heritage not hate.

677
00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:27,820
That's what it says under the 
confederate flag because I understand it

678
00:30:27,821 --> 00:30:30,100
means something to them,
but if I'm a black person it's still.

679
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:33,240
That's like a swastika could mean peace 
and was it jainism?

680
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:35,890
But most people are like.
It's kind of a shitty thing.

681
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:38,590
It's a very good point.
The swastika is a very good point.

682
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:40,150
I mean,
no one believes that.

683
00:30:40,151 --> 00:30:42,550
It means peace.
He's the general of that though.

684
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:46,210
Like who's the guy in charge of.
I hate the kid rock.

685
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:51,720
He's from Michigan.
Yeah.

686
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:55,120
It's a weird thing that you get as the 
south of the north.

687
00:30:55,121 --> 00:30:58,270
The North and the south are still at 
odds in some spots.

688
00:30:58,330 --> 00:31:03,330
Yeah.
They still use terms like Yankees and 

689
00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:03,330
they get angry if your Yankee.
They deal.

690
00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:07,530
It's very weird.
It's weird because we don't have that 

691
00:31:07,530 --> 00:31:07,530
feeling.
It's a clear,

692
00:31:07,530 --> 00:31:10,351
the conquer and the conquered northern 
as we don't have that problem with like 

693
00:31:10,351 --> 00:31:11,740
we like southern accents sound 
sophisticated,

694
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:17,850
sound hot southern accent makes someone 
sounds a man of taste and culture.

695
00:31:20,591 --> 00:31:25,591
Who appreciates the.
I hear Amanda Tasting called Georgia 

696
00:31:26,671 --> 00:31:28,620
Southern Gentlemen as well,
right?

697
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:29,930
Texas?
No,

698
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,180
no.
Long drawn out thing.

699
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:33,140
It sounds like.
You know,

700
00:31:33,150 --> 00:31:35,800
I'm going to Walmart to get some of 
that,

701
00:31:35,801 --> 00:31:39,040
but there's also in the dudes that are 
intelligent than have that accent.

702
00:31:39,041 --> 00:31:44,041
It's pretty bad ass.
It's one of those things and one of the 

703
00:31:44,041 --> 00:31:46,021
appeals of Bill Hicks,
I believe that that Texas accent was 

704
00:31:46,021 --> 00:31:46,021
fucking cool.

705
00:31:46,021 --> 00:31:47,020
It's cool here and people from Texas 
talk,

706
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:52,590
Texas,
Texas is one of the coolest ways to 

707
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:52,590
talk.
I really believed that he'd been.

708
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:56,691
It depends on,
and this is for anything where you're 

709
00:31:56,691 --> 00:31:57,690
from because there's a Texas accent and 
then if you're from Dallas.

710
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:00,880
To me it's this very preachy.
I just.

711
00:32:00,881 --> 00:32:02,350
I'm reminded of my teachers that were 
like,

712
00:32:02,351 --> 00:32:03,770
no ma'am,
you cannot get it.

713
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,820
Maybe that's just.
Maybe it's just me.

714
00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:09,400
Did anybody ever do anything to you in 
Dallas and you drive through,

715
00:32:09,401 --> 00:32:11,600
just stuck in your head like,
you know,

716
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:14,410
there's certain states of mind that you 
entrap in certain areas.

717
00:32:14,411 --> 00:32:18,760
Like for the longest time I would go by 
my high school in Newton,

718
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:21,660
Massachusetts and I would drive by the 
high school and I'd be paranoid,

719
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:26,700
panicked thinking that the,
the I missed a class and they're going 

720
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:30,201
to drag me back in.
I'm not going to get my diploma and I'm 

721
00:32:30,201 --> 00:32:31,350
fucked and I have to go back to school.
Like being from there.

722
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:36,480
Being from Texas,
I think of that teacher talks to you 

723
00:32:36,661 --> 00:32:38,170
like this.
We don't like Jews.

724
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:42,260
Did you ever have a teacher actually say
that?

725
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,840
No,
but I did have a friend who,

726
00:32:44,841 --> 00:32:48,650
this is my really old.
I got out unscathed for the most part.

727
00:32:48,890 --> 00:32:50,770
I had a friend who told me,
uh,

728
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:55,980
we were like best friends her with 
summer and she told me one day we were 

729
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:57,350
like playing and it was like five.
And she goes,

730
00:32:57,410 --> 00:33:00,080
if you don't accept Jesus Christ as your
personal Lord and Savior,

731
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:05,110
you are going to go to hell.
And I guess I had seen a movie recently 

732
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:05,120
that had this wild,
like we were like six,

733
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:10,150
five or probably five,
and I guess I had seen a movie in my 

734
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:11,030
automatic response was I have naked 
pictures of your mother.

735
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:13,220
I had heard it like on a movie or 
something.

736
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:18,460
Her mom calls my mom now allows,
said something inappropriate about 

737
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:21,020
having naked pictures of me.
My mom was like,

738
00:33:21,021 --> 00:33:23,780
well to be fair,
you told your daughter,

739
00:33:23,781 --> 00:33:26,420
told my daughter she was going to hell.
And her answer,

740
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:28,230
her response was,
oh,

741
00:33:28,231 --> 00:33:29,660
well we'll have to talk to her about 
that.

742
00:33:29,661 --> 00:33:31,820
She's not supposed to start witness 
until she's older.

743
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:34,130
That was like,
what?

744
00:33:34,290 --> 00:33:39,290
We have supposed to start witnessing.
Oh God.

745
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:41,540
So you,
you think of things like that?

746
00:33:41,541 --> 00:33:43,040
Not Southern Gentleman.

747
00:33:45,930 --> 00:33:47,030
Oh my God.
Well,

748
00:33:47,031 --> 00:33:48,530
you know boulder,
Colorado,

749
00:33:48,531 --> 00:33:51,910
everybody thinks of hippies,
but it's also a Jonbenet Ramsey from.

750
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:54,650
Yeah,
that is where that happened.

751
00:33:55,490 --> 00:34:00,490
I still think of hippies,
but I didn't think of Dallas in that 

752
00:34:00,681 --> 00:34:01,780
way.
Well,

753
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:06,790
it's just,
it's a perfect combination of southern 

754
00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:08,210
charm with money in a snotty attic.
It's like the Hollywood of Texas.

755
00:34:08,810 --> 00:34:11,600
They're the people of Texas.
I mean,

756
00:34:11,601 --> 00:34:12,890
I love Dallas,
new Cambie.

757
00:34:12,891 --> 00:34:15,470
It's got a lot of money.
So the hardest part of yours,

758
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:18,230
I'll tell you,
had more semi black out.

759
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:22,610
Even the whole state of Texas.
We used to do that.

760
00:34:22,611 --> 00:34:24,260
Addison Improv.
My God.

761
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:25,880
Yeah,
with Joey Diaz.

762
00:34:25,881 --> 00:34:29,270
They'll place was chaos and addison was 
the only.

763
00:34:29,330 --> 00:34:34,330
This is not no one cares,
but addison was the only county within 

764
00:34:34,330 --> 00:34:35,300
Dallas where you could drink for a very 
long time,

765
00:34:35,690 --> 00:34:37,780
like in the eighties,
I think that was World War II.

766
00:34:37,781 --> 00:34:42,781
Yeah.
I feel like parents have these special 

767
00:34:42,781 --> 00:34:42,781
tickets.

768
00:34:42,781 --> 00:34:42,781
You had to have something now it has all
the bars,

769
00:34:42,781 --> 00:34:43,340
but you can drink anywhere.
Obviously.

770
00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:48,690
Kind of makes sense that they did that.
That kind of makes sense because it's 

771
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:49,910
such a wild place.
It's a perfect place for that Improv.

772
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:54,940
That's a great club.
Math club in pro res should fears 

773
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:54,940
headline in that.
Yeah.

774
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:59,870
Yeah.
He's got a headline that you're in San 

775
00:34:59,870 --> 00:34:59,870
Antonio.
You're not impressed.

776
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:02,090
I'm not impressed.
It's nice.

777
00:35:02,130 --> 00:35:07,130
It's my hometown,
so they had me ex boyfriends ever show 

778
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:07,130
up.
[inaudible] shows.

779
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:09,590
I've invited them to high school or 
something.

780
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:10,190
Yeah,
that's fine.

781
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,150
Okay.
That's fine.

782
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:17,010
I don't think so.
I don't know how you communicate with 

783
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:17,010
your ex boyfriends from high school?
No,

784
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:21,380
but not out of disdain or anything.
Just one you know,

785
00:35:21,381 --> 00:35:24,290
you don't talk to.
And then another one is probably married

786
00:35:24,291 --> 00:35:27,350
and don't have any relationships where 
it's like,

787
00:35:27,351 --> 00:35:29,510
I don't want to fucking see him.
I swear to Christ.

788
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:32,960
None of them know.
It's always ends amicably.

789
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:34,460
If I saw someone,
I'd probably give him a hug.

790
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,020
I don't know if they would give me a 
hug,

791
00:35:36,021 --> 00:35:38,130
but you're usually the one that pulls

792
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:41,520
the trigger.
I don't think I've ever,

793
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:43,650
uh,
never been dumped,

794
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,230
which is not going to be anyone like me 
anymore.

795
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:50,430
But yeah,
just funny.

796
00:35:54,050 --> 00:35:56,940
No,
not out of like,

797
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:58,410
oh,
I always win.

798
00:35:58,411 --> 00:36:00,120
But just,
just,

799
00:36:00,121 --> 00:36:05,121
you always.
When somebody come to a natural end and 

800
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:05,700
listen,
it's part of your spirit,

801
00:36:05,701 --> 00:36:07,440
your competitive.
It's not a bad thing.

802
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:12,470
You defend it.
It's harder for the person doing the 

803
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:12,470
breaking up.
I think sometimes it is.

804
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:17,420
You don't want to hurt someone's 
feelings because I've been in 

805
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:17,420
relationships for a while,
but I just didn't want to hurt someone's

806
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:18,500
feelings.
Yeah.

807
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:21,120
And then when you're the one that has to
do the breaking up,

808
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:23,100
if you're ever feeling bad about in the 
future,

809
00:36:23,101 --> 00:36:25,500
you can't call them because you're the 
one that initiated it.

810
00:36:25,501 --> 00:36:30,501
That's like a dick thing.
So you just have to keep it to yourself 

811
00:36:30,501 --> 00:36:30,860
and be sad.
So sad.

812
00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:32,310
So sad.
So hard.

813
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:39,740
Some people are not meant to be and that
that person needs to find whatever the 

814
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:40,180
fuck they're meant to be with my porch 
bitch.

815
00:36:40,410 --> 00:36:44,550
How do you fix one of those domestic 
violence holes that sometimes you get in

816
00:36:44,551 --> 00:36:46,800
your walls so you know what it's like a 
humongous holding.

817
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:48,360
Punched you.
Yeah,

818
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:52,380
because that's something hardcore or is 
that really easy to.

819
00:36:52,381 --> 00:36:54,540
Do you ever done any wall board?
Yeah.

820
00:36:54,541 --> 00:36:57,820
Have you ever done any dry wall work and
like I think maybe a patch.

821
00:36:58,130 --> 00:37:03,130
I punched the hole in the wall.
Well you got to be careful because you 

822
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:03,130
don't know what the fuck you're doing.
You could actually,

823
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:07,520
Natalie,
you know you're going to have to use a 

824
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:07,520
razor knife.
You could accidentally slice.

825
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:07,820
You're an electrical cord.
All right.

826
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:09,320
You know you should hire someone to do 
it.

827
00:37:09,330 --> 00:37:12,030
I should leave it as a warning to the 
next girl.

828
00:37:13,090 --> 00:37:18,090
You know what,
you should do glue some false eyelashes 

829
00:37:18,090 --> 00:37:19,050
and fake blood around the edges of it.
And.

830
00:37:20,090 --> 00:37:20,810
Oh,
I thought you were going to.

831
00:37:20,970 --> 00:37:22,880
No,
just because it's in the back.

832
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:26,760
Make it look like a little like 
evidence.

833
00:37:26,761 --> 00:37:28,470
I guess if the girls had just went right
through it.

834
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:32,350
That's the evidence,
you know,

835
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,640
subtle.
Nothing crazy.

836
00:37:35,641 --> 00:37:38,820
Not a wig.
It's in the bathroom now.

837
00:37:38,821 --> 00:37:39,770
Right.
Toilet.

838
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:42,180
So it looks like I have a hidden camera 
in there now.

839
00:37:42,530 --> 00:37:44,880
You should put a hit on my girlfriend 
has to do.

840
00:37:44,970 --> 00:37:46,450
You should put a camera there.
Yeah,

841
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:51,500
I should have done a webcam up and shit.
Didn't the toilet roll there and make it

842
00:37:52,951 --> 00:37:55,050
look like a road when that role,
no one.

843
00:37:55,051 --> 00:37:57,930
Does it allow people to watch you shit 
for like five bucks a month.

844
00:37:57,931 --> 00:37:59,850
I bet you would get.
I bet you'd pay your rent.

845
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:05,040
I pay to watch you shit.
That could be a good way.

846
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:06,930
Not Me.
People would definitely do that.

847
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,010
If they could.
If you could,

848
00:38:08,011 --> 00:38:13,011
if you could have subscribed to a 24 
hour webcam that's only above the 

849
00:38:13,011 --> 00:38:13,020
toilet.
You would get a lot of.

850
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:18,080
Especially if you're a girl.
When I put the camera in the toilet to 

851
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:18,120
watch the press,
probably illegal.

852
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:22,760
You're saying showing the actual poop,
showing the actual plant.

853
00:38:22,761 --> 00:38:25,770
That's probably illegal.
Weird show animal poop.

854
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:30,980
Well,
you know when you get into obscenity 

855
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:32,990
areas like,
like that Guy Max hardcore that got 

856
00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:36,141
arrested.
They arrested him in the most stringent 

857
00:38:36,141 --> 00:38:36,160
place in the country,

858
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:41,180
which was like this area of Florida that
have the harshest laws and that's how 

859
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:42,430
they prosecuted him because he was 
selling stuff on the Internet.

860
00:38:42,431 --> 00:38:45,730
If you sold stuff to that area.
He's prosecuted by the laws of that area

861
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:51,540
just to terrible fucking evil porns 
where he would do nasty terrible things 

862
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:51,820
to girls.
It's like really,

863
00:38:51,821 --> 00:38:54,160
really like,
but it wasn't shit.

864
00:38:54,161 --> 00:38:54,780
Yeah,
yeah,

865
00:38:55,270 --> 00:39:00,270
yeah.
I mean it is and it isn't because he's 

866
00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:03,030
poor fucking girls glut.
He opened up this girl's asshole with a 

867
00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:04,960
tool like this thing.
Speculum,

868
00:39:04,961 --> 00:39:07,180
I guess it wouldn't be pissed inside of 
it.

869
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:10,300
And then had her drink the pis through a
straw.

870
00:39:12,690 --> 00:39:16,870
Yeah.
It sounds like something you'd make up.

871
00:39:17,010 --> 00:39:20,790
Exactly.
It sounds completely ridiculous what she

872
00:39:20,791 --> 00:39:22,570
must have been addicted to drugs as 
well.

873
00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:23,310
I think,
you know,

874
00:39:23,350 --> 00:39:25,120
there's some really last people out 
there,

875
00:39:25,121 --> 00:39:30,121
man,
and he's taking advantage of them and 

876
00:39:30,121 --> 00:39:30,121
it's,
it's,

877
00:39:30,121 --> 00:39:30,121
it is illegal and I guess it shouldn't 
be.

878
00:39:30,121 --> 00:39:34,490
I mean,
I'm not the one that's saying that we 

879
00:39:34,490 --> 00:39:36,691
need extra laws,
but I am the one that's saying he's a 

880
00:39:36,691 --> 00:39:38,821
fucking creep.
The fact that you would want to do that 

881
00:39:38,821 --> 00:39:38,821
to somebody,
you know,

882
00:39:38,821 --> 00:39:41,140
nobody wants you to do that to them.
It was creepy man.

883
00:39:41,141 --> 00:39:43,510
And that's just one of them.
He pisses and girls miles.

884
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:48,660
I can somehow know the guy who could 
piss with a heart on it was really 

885
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:48,660
weird.
I can do that.

886
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:52,800
Well,
it's just about bending your feet and 

887
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:52,800
pushing it down,
pushing down.

888
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:53,110
So if I have to,
but do you ever have to pee while you're

889
00:39:53,111 --> 00:39:53,650
having sex?

890
00:39:53,650 --> 00:39:55,360
Ever?
Really?

891
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:56,350
Yeah.
Wow.

892
00:39:56,740 --> 00:39:59,860
I will stop in the middle of the morning
sex all the time.

893
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,690
Oh,
well he pee all the time anyway.

894
00:40:01,970 --> 00:40:03,490
Well he actually,
I was,

895
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:07,270
this girl was giving him and he,
he's,

896
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:10,860
he's got a full boner and he pees into 
her mouth and it's like falling out.

897
00:40:10,870 --> 00:40:15,870
I mean it's a lot of Pii and then he 
shoves her head back down and again I'm 

898
00:40:15,870 --> 00:40:15,870
like,
why am I watching this?

899
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,610
I don't know why I'm laughing because 
it's gross.

900
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:21,400
My girlfriend has always been.
I know that poor girl,

901
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,140
she was like,
you know,

902
00:40:23,141 --> 00:40:25,730
like your next door neighbor and you 
knew that her mom,

903
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:31,320
her and you grew up and you know,
she was like that 14 year old girl that 

904
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,930
looked to you for guidance and peed in 
her mouth.

905
00:40:33,090 --> 00:40:38,090
No,
a car hit the wall.

906
00:40:38,141 --> 00:40:39,550
Yeah,
he did some time.

907
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:40,630
I think he's out now.

908
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:41,710
I think.
I'm not sure,

909
00:40:41,890 --> 00:40:43,630
but it was a really controversial,
um,

910
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:46,570
sort of a situation because nobody 
wanted to defend him.

911
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:47,680
I mean,
not nobody,

912
00:40:47,681 --> 00:40:50,160
a lot of people did,
but a lot of people were,

913
00:40:50,530 --> 00:40:51,210
you know,
a lot,

914
00:40:51,250 --> 00:40:54,250
a lot of people in the porn industry.
We're saying good,

915
00:40:54,251 --> 00:40:55,540
fuck him.
He's a creep.

916
00:40:55,541 --> 00:40:58,440
Like what he does is gross and there's a
lot of people that like,

917
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:04,660
they don't want that to be in the same 
lumping as regular size there.

918
00:41:04,741 --> 00:41:05,250
Right,
right.

919
00:41:06,370 --> 00:41:07,750
Well,
beggars can't be choosers.

920
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:13,550
My girlfriend has this hot oil she puts 
in her hair in the shower that's 

921
00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:16,531
supposed to help damaged hair or dry 
hair kind of issue.

922
00:41:18,131 --> 00:41:19,930
Black kind of.
I wasn't even joking.

923
00:41:19,970 --> 00:41:23,230
I don't use hot oil.
Well what we do,

924
00:41:23,231 --> 00:41:25,600
but not like black people.
Anyways,

925
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:30,860
it's spilled in the.
She wasn't using it but it's spilled 

926
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:31,840
into the bathtub and I stepped in the 
bathtub.

927
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:34,220
Did one of those like seriously,
like three stooges.

928
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:37,890
That back flip by God,
I'd hit the wall less,

929
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:39,470
Huh?
Yeah.

930
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:44,590
So that's how you got this whole.
He has announced this huge bowling ball 

931
00:41:44,590 --> 00:41:47,721
hole.
You're super lucky and people die that 

932
00:41:47,721 --> 00:41:47,721
way.
Man.

933
00:41:47,730 --> 00:41:51,410
The Tub is actually a way that people 
die on a regular basis.

934
00:41:52,030 --> 00:41:57,030
Will slip in the shower.
Were you supposed to get rock hard right

935
00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:03,230
when you guys started?
You get super hard,

936
00:42:03,231 --> 00:42:04,990
like the hardest you've ever gotten.
It's kind of like that.

937
00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:07,110
The death building.
Yeah.

938
00:42:07,670 --> 00:42:10,970
I've heard that and I've heard it's only
if you get like certain poisons,

939
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:14,000
certain certain toxins,
your body or something.

940
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:16,340
I just want to die.
I certainly want to do.

941
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,170
That'd be awesome if it happens.
That's what I'm saying.

942
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:20,300
What a death Boehner wasn't in that 
movie too.

943
00:42:20,301 --> 00:42:25,301
That's the one that the Nicolas cage 
movie where he played a Elisabeth Shue.

944
00:42:26,390 --> 00:42:29,150
He played leaving Las Vegas,
leaving Las Vegas.

945
00:42:29,330 --> 00:42:34,330
Original title was deaf.
Like yeah,

946
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:40,850
it's not going to sell in the blue 
states in the red states or other.

947
00:42:41,130 --> 00:42:43,810
Sounds like rock band.
Awesome.

948
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:46,640
This should be a fucking band.
Just her for sure.

949
00:42:47,330 --> 00:42:48,980
I'm sure there is.
Can we google it?

950
00:42:49,070 --> 00:42:49,940
Yeah,
but there is.

951
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:53,310
Owner of a dog is ripping apart.
Yeah,

952
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:56,060
right.
Absolutely.

953
00:42:56,450 --> 00:42:59,930
I mean,
I think if you ask any guys wikipedia,

954
00:43:01,630 --> 00:43:02,780
skinny guys,
you would want to dive,

955
00:43:02,810 --> 00:43:04,290
have a boner,
but I don't think if you asked her,

956
00:43:04,330 --> 00:43:06,120
you know,
with no,

957
00:43:06,130 --> 00:43:11,050
if you have a boner,
I think injuries,

958
00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:14,150
spinal cord injuries known to be 
associated with prep,

959
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:16,140
a priapism,
injuries,

960
00:43:19,150 --> 00:43:24,150
injuries to the cerebellum or spinal 
cord are often associated with pariah.

961
00:43:26,051 --> 00:43:29,680
Prism is that it prepares them in living
patients.

962
00:43:29,681 --> 00:43:32,920
So it's when,
when some people,

963
00:43:32,921 --> 00:43:35,800
when they're talking about like death by
hanging executions,

964
00:43:35,950 --> 00:43:38,170
shit like that dude's Dick,
get hard.

965
00:43:39,130 --> 00:43:44,130
That's the way to go.
Is that because they've observed the 

966
00:43:44,130 --> 00:43:44,130
effects of the genitals of both men and 
women.

967
00:43:44,130 --> 00:43:48,661
Jesus Christ,
where they shoot a chicken the head and 

968
00:43:48,661 --> 00:43:49,170
then check to see if she's in the lobby.
Oh my God.

969
00:43:49,171 --> 00:43:50,590
The Labia,
Labia and quit.

970
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:55,620
Quitters becoming gorged and there may 
be a discharge of blood from the vagina 

971
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:58,600
here.
Uh,

972
00:43:58,650 --> 00:43:59,710
yeah.
My God.

973
00:44:00,430 --> 00:44:05,430
It's like nature's Hail Mary.
Hail Mary in nature's like listening.

974
00:44:06,341 --> 00:44:08,230
We might be dying right now.
So just like any.

975
00:44:08,231 --> 00:44:10,570
Let anybody fuck us and maybe we'll get 
pregnant.

976
00:44:12,010 --> 00:44:15,350
Bloody death.
Tier blood is already your body's,

977
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:17,350
your body doesn't know what to do.
That's what it is.

978
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:19,660
It's a rap song.
Wow.

979
00:44:19,690 --> 00:44:22,660
Fatal gunshot wounds.
The brain that's happens.

980
00:44:22,990 --> 00:44:25,840
No is just wikipedia and some articles 
that references,

981
00:44:25,841 --> 00:44:30,841
but it's.
It's actually a real phenomenon that 

982
00:44:30,841 --> 00:44:30,841
happens sometimes.
Pretty fucking nuts.

983
00:44:32,020 --> 00:44:32,920
Debt,
boner.

984
00:44:33,410 --> 00:44:34,860
You Die.
What do you want to be?

985
00:44:34,861 --> 00:44:36,140
Wet Du du Du,
Du.

986
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:41,640
Look,
do you want.

987
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:43,770
Do you want.
Why would I care?

988
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:50,020
Because we know all guys would want to 
have a bone corner looking and I don't 

989
00:44:50,191 --> 00:44:51,270
want anywhere.
Report really.

990
00:44:51,290 --> 00:44:56,290
Shoes really wet.
Like I just want to be a nice normal 

991
00:44:56,290 --> 00:44:57,060
death.
Nothing like freaky.

992
00:44:57,990 --> 00:45:02,990
Does it drive you crazy?
That coordinator gets the CNA who at my 

993
00:45:02,990 --> 00:45:04,300
husband,
whoever finds me to be like,

994
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:07,440
she was so key.
She was so turned off because that makes

995
00:45:07,441 --> 00:45:09,150
you weird.
Then they're gonna Think,

996
00:45:09,151 --> 00:45:14,151
oh,
she died when she was watching the 

997
00:45:14,151 --> 00:45:14,151
golden girls and she was like,
you're going to think it's a thing.

998
00:45:14,530 --> 00:45:15,720
I don't want any of that.
Yeah,

999
00:45:15,730 --> 00:45:20,220
it's going to be on your death report.
Wet that's under,

1000
00:45:20,221 --> 00:45:25,221
under under moisture was watching golden
girls because I watch it every night 

1001
00:45:25,221 --> 00:45:25,260
before I go to bed.

1002
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:29,210
God forbid I have an aneurysm medium and
ready to rock.

1003
00:45:29,570 --> 00:45:32,910
So you're that addicted to the golden 
girls that you've named or Dog African?

1004
00:45:33,570 --> 00:45:35,900
No,
it just happens to be a coincidence.

1005
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:40,960
Yeah.
Should I just picked an old lady name 

1006
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:40,960
and blanche came into my head and then 
as of late I started watching the golden

1007
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:41,810
girls,
but this was.

1008
00:45:41,811 --> 00:45:43,730
I got her like three years.
Have you watched the golden girls?

1009
00:45:43,731 --> 00:45:46,070
Is it because it's on when I go to bed.
I love it.

1010
00:45:46,220 --> 00:45:47,210
Good show.
It's relaxing.

1011
00:45:47,390 --> 00:45:49,490
A warm hug to you when you watch the 
show?

1012
00:45:49,550 --> 00:45:50,520
Yeah.
What's one more time?

1013
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:55,840
It's the writing is so smart.
I haven't watched that sit common 

1014
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:57,560
friends over.
It's on a one of our affiliate,

1015
00:45:57,590 --> 00:45:59,240
whatever.
If you had to sleep with one,

1016
00:45:59,241 --> 00:46:01,160
which one would it be in mind?
It's always Betty White.

1017
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:04,230
Why would you say back in the day she 
was the hottest ones.

1018
00:46:04,230 --> 00:46:05,890
She was a young qc.
Feisty one.

1019
00:46:05,891 --> 00:46:08,170
You remember?
They were all like 900 years old.

1020
00:46:08,171 --> 00:46:08,990
Well,
one was creepy,

1021
00:46:08,991 --> 00:46:13,991
one was that quagmire that whatever.
That's why wouldn't you want to sleep 

1022
00:46:13,991 --> 00:46:15,430
with Rue mcclanahan?
She was the one that quagmire.

1023
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:20,480
She was a woman.
That was her thing really for 

1024
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:20,480
rheumatoid.
Okay.

1025
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:22,010
The Betty White played rose and she was 
an idiot.

1026
00:46:22,370 --> 00:46:26,300
Bea Arthur played Dorothy's born acc who
was really smart street feet tall.

1027
00:46:26,370 --> 00:46:27,650
Yeah.
She was a lesbian and real life.

1028
00:46:27,740 --> 00:46:32,740
And then rue mcclanahan who played 
blanche devereaux who was a self 

1029
00:46:32,740 --> 00:46:35,981
proclaimed slut and she was always 
running off to lack sleep with some 

1030
00:46:35,981 --> 00:46:36,270
eligible young men.
Right.

1031
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:39,440
And you would want to sit with that one 
because she was Betty White all the way.

1032
00:46:39,530 --> 00:46:42,710
That was the Krissy,
Krissy.

1033
00:46:42,950 --> 00:46:44,090
Oh Chris,
who is the best one?

1034
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:45,470
Who's Chrissy?
And the third one.

1035
00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:47,390
The third one was Chrissy.

1036
00:46:47,390 --> 00:46:48,660
She was the second one.
First one.

1037
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:50,570
First is Ann Summers.
She was back in the day.

1038
00:46:50,571 --> 00:46:52,640
We're in this little shorts and she was 
the best one.

1039
00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:53,930
Yes,
definitely.

1040
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:55,760
Would you ever want to sleep with an 
older woman?

1041
00:46:55,910 --> 00:46:57,130
Like I was asleep.
Uh,

1042
00:46:57,131 --> 00:46:58,640
Suzanne somers,
like older,

1043
00:46:58,641 --> 00:47:00,420
like 60,
like 68,

1044
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:02,660
68,
probably not.

1045
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:06,860
Suzanne somers is probably that unlocked
the secret to living young.

1046
00:47:06,861 --> 00:47:07,930
She has the book on it.
Alright.

1047
00:47:07,970 --> 00:47:11,030
Demi Moore on drugs.
She's not 68 by any means.

1048
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:13,170
She's like almost 50.
Okay.

1049
00:47:13,190 --> 00:47:14,380
That's different.
Yeah,

1050
00:47:14,450 --> 00:47:18,350
she's hanging in there.
I guess she had some sort of a reaction.

1051
00:47:18,770 --> 00:47:23,770
Did you hear about that shit?
It was like red bull or something like 

1052
00:47:23,770 --> 00:47:23,770
that.
That's where they're,

1053
00:47:23,770 --> 00:47:23,830
that's know what it is.
She said,

1054
00:47:23,831 --> 00:47:28,831
well,
she apparently drinks nitrates and she 

1055
00:47:28,831 --> 00:47:28,831
did Salvia.
And that's,

1056
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:30,040
that's what it is.

1057
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:32,110
Hearing this from.
You can't just say this.

1058
00:47:32,210 --> 00:47:37,210
Allegedly for TMZ.
TMZ was reporting that it was a whatever

1059
00:47:39,881 --> 00:47:44,881
the nitrous oxide,
which could be true because she had a 

1060
00:47:44,881 --> 00:47:44,881
seizure.
She fished,

1061
00:47:44,881 --> 00:47:48,940
but that last like five to 10 minutes 
I've fished before now.

1062
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,690
Salvia.
The police report they had,

1063
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:56,050
they censored the nine one,
one call because of personal privacy and

1064
00:47:56,051 --> 00:47:56,710
then they,
they,

1065
00:47:56,711 --> 00:48:01,711
uh,
the police report came out as that she 

1066
00:48:01,711 --> 00:48:01,720
smoked something.
So you don't smoke.

1067
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:04,060
So I'm thinking it's Salvia.
I'm thinking that was.

1068
00:48:04,061 --> 00:48:08,470
What was she smoking?
Are you sure that the police report said

1069
00:48:08,471 --> 00:48:10,570
she smoked something or you just hearing
this from tmz?

1070
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:14,370
TMZ was reporting on it,
so that's what it is.

1071
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:15,540
Really.
Say that though.

1072
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:19,720
Then I'll finish it with allegedly.
Why don't.

1073
00:48:20,170 --> 00:48:23,560
Why don't we just google it real quick 
just so that we don't get in trouble?

1074
00:48:23,590 --> 00:48:25,270
No,
I'm 99 point nine percent sure.

1075
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:27,600
What was I talking about?
You were talking about her.

1076
00:48:28,810 --> 00:48:29,440
Well,
I just,

1077
00:48:29,470 --> 00:48:34,470
I don't know.
I just feel bad if the information is 

1078
00:48:34,470 --> 00:48:37,081
probably out there more.
You're saying that it was nitrous oxide 

1079
00:48:37,081 --> 00:48:41,071
and so I heard it was red bull.
Someone called it a death puddle data 

1080
00:48:41,071 --> 00:48:41,620
wet.
Oh,

1081
00:48:43,410 --> 00:48:45,100
a smoked.

1082
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:52,900
Her Pr people wouldn't put a spin on it.
The media doesn't have an allegiance to 

1083
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:53,560
the truth about celebrities,
so it's whatever they hear,

1084
00:48:53,561 --> 00:48:57,940
they're going to NBC right next to 
Rachel Maddow.

1085
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,210
You need your own.
Because I said allegiance.

1086
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:01,100
No,
you'd be great at it.

1087
00:49:01,630 --> 00:49:03,640
You're very articulate.
You've got a great vocabulary.

1088
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:06,670
You'd kick ass on one of those shows and
you'd be able to make fun of Shit.

1089
00:49:06,830 --> 00:49:11,830
Why don't you just.
What I want is that what you want to 

1090
00:49:11,830 --> 00:49:14,431
have a pilot we're doing with vh one.
I want to have my own late night chit 

1091
00:49:14,431 --> 00:49:16,240
chat,
like a talk show podcast,

1092
00:49:16,241 --> 00:49:18,310
yet I have a website that I do every 
week.

1093
00:49:18,370 --> 00:49:19,820
Oh,
you do a on.

1094
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:23,350
Of course one loves sound off on why 
people are wrong every Monday.

1095
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:24,440
What is it?
What do you do?

1096
00:49:24,460 --> 00:49:26,420
Call the weekly news,
the weekly news,

1097
00:49:27,010 --> 00:49:27,430
type it in.

1098
00:49:27,770 --> 00:49:31,770
Go to the stream as in water,
the stream.tv/and

1099
00:49:31,780 --> 00:49:33,430
then put the swimsuit or underwear 
weekly.

1100
00:49:33,431 --> 00:49:37,110
W E a k o y for five years.
Yup.

1101
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:40,390
Demi Moore and three m dot TV.
What is their a slash weekly wea.

1102
00:49:40,580 --> 00:49:45,580
Why?
Demi Moore has smoked something similar 

1103
00:49:45,580 --> 00:49:49,441
to incense and semi conscious.
Barely said the word voice on the 911 

1104
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:55,480
call to get more help.
So similar to incense.

1105
00:49:55,750 --> 00:49:58,090
Fucking idiot who smoked.
Closest thing to.

1106
00:49:58,091 --> 00:50:02,050
Similar to incense of Salvia.
You think I'm a hundred percent.

1107
00:50:02,051 --> 00:50:07,051
She smoked Salvia.
She didn't already shifted into a 

1108
00:50:07,051 --> 00:50:07,051
different world.
You know,

1109
00:50:07,051 --> 00:50:08,170
I'm going to have you ever saw that 
video is awesome.

1110
00:50:08,260 --> 00:50:10,840
Similar to incidents.
That's sage.

1111
00:50:11,820 --> 00:50:12,740
Salvia,
yes,

1112
00:50:12,970 --> 00:50:15,520
Salvia.
So she went to the other world,

1113
00:50:15,521 --> 00:50:20,521
which you can easily do dmt style.
Like I mean you can get it pretty close 

1114
00:50:20,521 --> 00:50:21,170
to dmt kind of effects from it.
She,

1115
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:24,400
but my question is why did,
maybe she,

1116
00:50:24,430 --> 00:50:28,010
her body had a little stroke because of 
it or something because of her age,

1117
00:50:28,190 --> 00:50:32,090
because she's not that old man.
The old for a hot chick.

1118
00:50:32,510 --> 00:50:33,650
She's not like,
oh,

1119
00:50:33,651 --> 00:50:37,010
like she's in trouble.
The only reason I say that because after

1120
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:37,970
you know,
10 minutes,

1121
00:50:37,971 --> 00:50:39,600
15 minutes,
you usually are fine.

1122
00:50:39,601 --> 00:50:43,400
So unless the ambulance was right next 
door would be speculating.

1123
00:50:43,401 --> 00:50:45,650
Yeah,
maybe I'm totally speculating.

1124
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:51,680
Something similar to insights does sound
like Salvia because sage,

1125
00:50:51,681 --> 00:50:56,681
the sage is something that people 
frequently burned to like ward off 

1126
00:50:56,681 --> 00:50:58,820
spirits and shit.
And then sage is the Salvia plant.

1127
00:50:58,821 --> 00:51:01,460
It's like the same plant.
Whoever was the same.

1128
00:51:01,590 --> 00:51:06,590
Exactly know what she was doing.
So they're obviously covering up the 

1129
00:51:06,590 --> 00:51:09,431
fact that she was doing something that 
they don't want the public to know that 

1130
00:51:09,431 --> 00:51:12,160
it's possible.
I would like something similar to 

1131
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:14,861
smoking and no one would say that that's
such a ridiculous thing to pull out of 

1132
00:51:14,861 --> 00:51:19,151
your ass.
I just don't think they want to 

1133
00:51:19,151 --> 00:51:19,520
advertise that it was probably because 
it's still legal in most states and they

1134
00:51:19,521 --> 00:51:22,160
just don't want to advertise it at all.

1135
00:51:22,190 --> 00:51:23,450
That's right.
That's a good point.

1136
00:51:23,451 --> 00:51:28,451
That's a very good point because if it 
was an actual illegal drug that would 

1137
00:51:28,451 --> 00:51:31,241
want to know what the drug was and since
probably that makes a real a lot of 

1138
00:51:31,241 --> 00:51:31,460
sense to do.
You should be a fucking detective.

1139
00:51:31,510 --> 00:51:33,250
I know.
Forgot that.

1140
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:38,500
You should just.
You should really for CSI or something 

1141
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:38,820
like you totally did the math there.
Yeah.

1142
00:51:38,990 --> 00:51:40,130
Yeah,
because if it was anything else,

1143
00:51:40,131 --> 00:51:42,500
if it was like she was smoking cocaine,
like Whoa.

1144
00:51:42,501 --> 00:51:43,440
They would tell you,
hey she.

1145
00:51:43,470 --> 00:51:46,040
This is a sensational story.
She's a poor girl.

1146
00:51:46,041 --> 00:51:51,041
She's smoking cocaine,
which is smoking something similar to 

1147
00:51:51,041 --> 00:51:52,490
incense and that's why she salvia can 
fuck your world up.

1148
00:51:52,670 --> 00:51:56,900
I'll have to do is look at that video of
Ra on your or me or you talking about my

1149
00:51:56,901 --> 00:51:59,000
face,
but when Ra was on your show?

1150
00:51:59,170 --> 00:52:04,170
Yeah,
when he was on TV and he did Salvia and 

1151
00:52:04,170 --> 00:52:04,170
just melted into everybody.

1152
00:52:04,170 --> 00:52:05,000
Yup.
Yeah,

1153
00:52:05,090 --> 00:52:07,210
and he was calling up a Sam.
It was so cute.

1154
00:52:07,211 --> 00:52:12,211
She and if somebody talked to her to 
doing that and she's not used to 

1155
00:52:12,211 --> 00:52:12,211
psychedelics,
if she hasn't had a second,

1156
00:52:12,211 --> 00:52:16,891
I'm just not used to something and she 
had a bad trip and maybe she's on some 

1157
00:52:16,891 --> 00:52:17,790
other things or it could also be that it
know,

1158
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:20,580
ignited some,
like horrible insecurity in her too.

1159
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:23,940
And she had a panic attack.
Been secure about the arts.

1160
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:27,470
I'm totally kidding.
I love you to do that.

1161
00:52:28,070 --> 00:52:30,290
I typed in the stream.tv
the weekly,

1162
00:52:30,291 --> 00:52:31,580
but it says,
oh,

1163
00:52:31,910 --> 00:52:36,910
the stream.tv/slash
w slash o weekly w e a k?

1164
00:52:39,140 --> 00:52:40,100
Yeah.
Oh,

1165
00:52:40,101 --> 00:52:41,720
okay.
I don't have a strong point of view.

1166
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:42,630
I got.
Oh,

1167
00:52:42,730 --> 00:52:44,540
okay.
You create a show.

1168
00:52:45,830 --> 00:52:49,370
We did one on Monday.
The weekly news.

1169
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:52,040
Powerful.
And so you do this every week.

1170
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:57,100
Every Monday we have a studio and it's a
network and those other shows on there 

1171
00:52:57,100 --> 00:52:57,860
and we'd been doing it for about five 
years.

1172
00:52:57,950 --> 00:52:59,900
Oh really?
You know,

1173
00:53:00,380 --> 00:53:02,840
eventually this is going to be a 
television station.

1174
00:53:02,841 --> 00:53:04,370
Huh?
I mean that is the future.

1175
00:53:05,490 --> 00:53:09,110
He's got some the owner of the thing.
It's got some pretty cool things going,

1176
00:53:09,111 --> 00:53:11,660
but that's my little forum.
Cool.

1177
00:53:12,330 --> 00:53:13,810
Alright.
We'll tell people to go there.

1178
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:15,800
Fuck yeah,
for sure.

1179
00:53:15,830 --> 00:53:17,990
We're not too sure.
Boom.

1180
00:53:17,991 --> 00:53:20,030
It's done.
We've just made a date.

1181
00:53:20,060 --> 00:53:25,060
We had a segment called who should be 
shot where we argue the lesser of two 

1182
00:53:25,060 --> 00:53:27,881
evils.
It usually has to do with who should be 

1183
00:53:27,881 --> 00:53:30,201
shot.
The supplier of the demand and then we 

1184
00:53:30,201 --> 00:53:30,201
talk about something so you can.
You can either.

1185
00:53:30,201 --> 00:53:34,910
You can pick what side you're on 
supplier or the demand for specific 

1186
00:53:34,910 --> 00:53:36,210
things for terrible things like guns or 
something like that.

1187
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:37,160
Well,
no,

1188
00:53:37,170 --> 00:53:38,700
it's more.
It's not as heavy handed.

1189
00:53:38,701 --> 00:53:41,040
Like last week I was talking about how 
much I hate chocolate fountains,

1190
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:44,940
so who should be shot the fat fucks that
wait in line or the caterer that's like,

1191
00:53:44,970 --> 00:53:45,800
Ooh,
chocolate Belgian.

1192
00:53:45,910 --> 00:53:49,590
Let me give you one,
why is it bad?

1193
00:53:49,591 --> 00:53:51,270
Strawberries with chocolate?
Yummy.

1194
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:53,850
That's fine.
But then people start to get into like,

1195
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:57,670
oh,
what else can I dip in the road?

1196
00:53:57,870 --> 00:54:02,870
Stop?
And by the end it's all like there's 

1197
00:54:02,870 --> 00:54:03,720
garbage in it and you partying with the 
wrong people.

1198
00:54:03,780 --> 00:54:04,800
Yeah.
Like golden corral.

1199
00:54:04,801 --> 00:54:09,801
Yeah.
I have to stop hanging out with those 

1200
00:54:09,801 --> 00:54:09,801
people.
Golden Corral.

1201
00:54:09,801 --> 00:54:12,051
What is that?
That's where they have a chocolate 

1202
00:54:12,051 --> 00:54:12,051
fountain.
It's the golden corral.

1203
00:54:12,051 --> 00:54:12,490
Poor people.
The crowd.

1204
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:14,700
It's like you've probably somewhere in 
the valley.

1205
00:54:14,701 --> 00:54:16,410
It's a like a family,
like,

1206
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:18,750
you know,
like a,

1207
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:21,300
um,
would it be like,

1208
00:54:21,930 --> 00:54:24,130
like a,
like a,

1209
00:54:24,330 --> 00:54:27,210
you never heard of hometown buffet or 
like a Bob Evans,

1210
00:54:27,211 --> 00:54:30,180
like it's like a place,
like a lot of food for a little money.

1211
00:54:30,630 --> 00:54:35,630
Not Super Nice,
but trying to think of some names in 

1212
00:54:35,630 --> 00:54:35,630
different places like tabulate that 
escaped me.

1213
00:54:35,630 --> 00:54:37,780
Less nice than a red lobster.
Yeah.

1214
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:41,430
Kinda like that.
A little bit nicer to is their big thing

1215
00:54:41,431 --> 00:54:43,200
is that they have a chocolate fountain.
So.

1216
00:54:43,510 --> 00:54:48,510
Well that's not what I'm talking about.
I'm talking about if you go to 

1217
00:54:48,510 --> 00:54:48,570
somebody's Dope Party and they've got a 
chocolate fountain,

1218
00:54:48,950 --> 00:54:50,850
do you ever go to someone's part of that
just goes ridiculous.

1219
00:54:51,170 --> 00:54:56,170
I went to this dude's party.
He had this crazy party in Malibu and 

1220
00:54:56,170 --> 00:55:00,220
he's like some super super billionaire 
type character and he had brought in 

1221
00:55:00,220 --> 00:55:04,101
snow and the whole hill was covered in 
snow and people were sledding at the 

1222
00:55:05,551 --> 00:55:07,140
entrance to your little community you 
live in.

1223
00:55:07,141 --> 00:55:12,141
There's a big thing that says snow day 
like because you know this dude had it 

1224
00:55:14,690 --> 00:55:19,690
on.
He had a ramp built like it was 

1225
00:55:19,690 --> 00:55:22,410
constructed because they didn't have 
enough of a grade for a hill.

1226
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:26,570
So he built it up just for the party or 
just for the party.

1227
00:55:26,580 --> 00:55:28,340
That's cool.
It was crazy.

1228
00:55:28,350 --> 00:55:31,490
They had so much shit going on,
but no chocolate fountain.

1229
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:37,560
I was this bitch ass party and I think 
they become so pedestrian like everyone 

1230
00:55:40,171 --> 00:55:42,040
has them now.
I wouldn't want it.

1231
00:55:42,180 --> 00:55:46,690
I loved them with strawberries.
Strawberries are not the same.

1232
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:50,940
It's not the same chocolates like it's 
shitty chocolates,

1233
00:55:50,941 --> 00:55:55,941
but I have a blog about it so I don't 
want to repeat my blog will repeat it 

1234
00:55:55,941 --> 00:55:55,941
because I'm not going to read it.
No,

1235
00:55:55,941 --> 00:55:55,941
no,
no.

1236
00:55:55,941 --> 00:56:00,710
I'm just saying like I don't want to.
I don't want it to look like I read my 

1237
00:56:00,710 --> 00:56:03,261
blog and then I go into like chocolate 
pellets that you can buy it.

1238
00:56:03,380 --> 00:56:05,920
Like,
no,

1239
00:56:06,180 --> 00:56:08,530
not like that.
It's like a special kind of chocolates.

1240
00:56:08,540 --> 00:56:13,540
Kind of like it's just gross.
It's just not the good chocolate 

1241
00:56:13,540 --> 00:56:14,130
chocolate.
And if you're a deli,

1242
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:19,160
dark chocolate,
some some fucking bad ass chocolate and 

1243
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:19,230
that was melted.
Would you be down?

1244
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:23,480
Because I also don't like chocolate 
tolerating far as.

1245
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:24,100
Oh

1246
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:25,720
my God,
she's such a strange woman.

1247
00:56:25,900 --> 00:56:29,790
She is so strange.
I don't like chocolate with her dogs.

1248
00:56:30,100 --> 00:56:35,100
Substitute for a child.
She fucking hating chocolate.

1249
00:56:36,030 --> 00:56:41,030
Candy and dumping men undefeated streak.
She's undefeated.

1250
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:44,650
The undefeated streak of men who a dog 
everywhere with her.

1251
00:56:44,710 --> 00:56:48,970
Do you mimic nursing that with that dog?
Ever terrible.

1252
00:56:49,390 --> 00:56:51,970
I wish I could say that I not only gave 
birth to her,

1253
00:56:51,971 --> 00:56:56,971
but that I nursed her up.
I mean,

1254
00:56:57,640 --> 00:56:58,480
do you,
uh,

1255
00:56:58,510 --> 00:57:01,720
do you have the urge to reproduce out a 
baby one day?

1256
00:57:02,340 --> 00:57:07,340
If you could have a baby with that dog 
with one dude that you decide to keep 

1257
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:10,270
around because I'm going to say,
listen,

1258
00:57:10,630 --> 00:57:11,370
you know,
you're,

1259
00:57:11,390 --> 00:57:13,150
you're,
you've been picked for your genetics and

1260
00:57:13,151 --> 00:57:15,670
intelligence,
but don't tell them what to do here.

1261
00:57:15,671 --> 00:57:20,671
We're going to make a baby together.
I'm going to kill him now.

1262
00:57:22,060 --> 00:57:25,070
What if you already jerked off that day 
and he's got nothing left for you?

1263
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:26,070
What?

1264
00:57:33,230 --> 00:57:34,520
What'd you have for sure?
Yeah,

1265
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:40,120
I think it gets weird when you don't 
want to be the girl that nagging your 

1266
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:44,091
boyfriend about it or something you 
don't want me to go and talks about all 

1267
00:57:44,091 --> 00:57:44,091
the time,
but I think,

1268
00:57:44,091 --> 00:57:44,940
you know,
we are genetically predisposed as women.

1269
00:57:45,180 --> 00:57:47,070
We're maternal.
We do want that one day.

1270
00:57:47,220 --> 00:57:48,900
So I take care of this little dog,
but I don't.

1271
00:57:49,110 --> 00:57:52,120
It's not like on my mind like,
I'm just going to babysit you.

1272
00:57:52,380 --> 00:57:57,380
Happens to draw pictures of what you 
want your baby to look like or anything 

1273
00:57:57,380 --> 00:57:58,620
weird like that.
Does that

1274
00:57:59,350 --> 00:58:02,570
the fuck?
Is that what you're black raven?

1275
00:58:02,580 --> 00:58:07,580
Way To make blogging creepy as fuck.
If anybody could make that the most 

1276
00:58:12,251 --> 00:58:15,310
beautiful of natural urges.
Seem creepy as fuck.

1277
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:20,600
It's you picturing some fucking crazy 
lady sitting there sketching out what 

1278
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:22,880
she wants her kids teeth to be

1279
00:58:24,430 --> 00:58:26,300
because I like that.
I think you fucking know.

1280
00:58:26,330 --> 00:58:27,820
Yeah.
Well that's the thing man.

1281
00:58:27,821 --> 00:58:32,821
Some people like anything.
There's a lot of people that like all 

1282
00:58:32,821 --> 00:58:32,821
kinds of crazy shit.
You know?

1283
00:58:32,821 --> 00:58:36,070
That's one of the worst things about 
growing up as experiencing the different

1284
00:58:36,071 --> 00:58:41,071
things that people not only tolerate but
actually love and then you try to bring 

1285
00:58:41,071 --> 00:58:42,190
them up with another person like get the
fuck Outta here.

1286
00:58:42,191 --> 00:58:47,191
They get angry at you.
I do it all the time.

1287
00:58:47,940 --> 00:58:49,720
I dropped my weight.
I want my baby to look like.

1288
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:55,440
I'm sure somebody has for sure so many 
mustangs.

1289
00:58:55,560 --> 00:59:00,560
They must've.
Babies are a little weird looking at 

1290
00:59:00,560 --> 00:59:00,560
first.
Sure.

1291
00:59:00,560 --> 00:59:00,800
Well,
they're terrified to know.

1292
00:59:00,810 --> 00:59:02,500
You look at it terrified object.
You're like,

1293
00:59:02,501 --> 00:59:03,850
oh Jesus,
poor little thing.

1294
00:59:04,770 --> 00:59:07,870
They have like dry skin sometimes and 
you're like,

1295
00:59:07,871 --> 00:59:08,950
what the fuck's going on here?
I'm like,

1296
00:59:10,150 --> 00:59:12,880
it's very tricky man.
Raising little babies is very tricky.

1297
00:59:12,881 --> 00:59:16,530
Keeping them for diseases.
Shots,

1298
00:59:16,540 --> 00:59:20,300
you know not to eat cat poop.
I can't imagine like,

1299
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:21,980
oh yeah,
you

1300
00:59:22,020 --> 00:59:25,880
gotta watch them every step.
I had my one and a half year old is just

1301
00:59:25,881 --> 00:59:30,881
now at the stage where I can let her get
like one or two feet in front of me 

1302
00:59:30,881 --> 00:59:35,720
doing something.
You've got to be right there right 

1303
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:35,720
there.
What are you doing?

1304
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:35,720
What's going on?
And then maybe a.

1305
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:38,000
sometimes she'll be in an area where she
can't mess anything up.

1306
00:59:38,020 --> 00:59:39,680
She was wandering around the bathroom 
like,

1307
00:59:39,681 --> 00:59:41,040
okay,
I've got an eye on you.

1308
00:59:41,041 --> 00:59:43,820
I'll let you walk a little,
but you have to always be right there in

1309
00:59:43,821 --> 00:59:44,720
case you're like,
what is this?

1310
00:59:44,721 --> 00:59:47,300
I like this and stick it in there.
You know?

1311
00:59:47,570 --> 00:59:49,130
They don't know.
They don't know anything.

1312
00:59:49,470 --> 00:59:49,840
Your baby

1313
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:55,080
crazy.
How you have that desire to protect her 

1314
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:56,170
in the like.
It's not hard for you to make sure she's

1315
00:59:56,171 --> 00:59:57,690
safe.
Like it's a natural instinct.

1316
00:59:57,910 --> 01:00:00,290
Even people who don't have children 
really have no idea what it,

1317
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:01,590
what the experience is like.
It's,

1318
01:00:01,591 --> 01:00:06,591
it's so hard to describe.
I thought I could kind of guess what it 

1319
01:00:06,591 --> 01:00:07,580
would be like before I actually had 
kids.

1320
01:00:07,820 --> 01:00:10,980
I would think it was probably really 
intense love and you know,

1321
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:13,910
it's probably really hard to probably 
test your patience,

1322
01:00:13,911 --> 01:00:14,450
but you're,
you know,

1323
01:00:14,451 --> 01:00:16,820
you really want.
It's not like that at all.

1324
01:00:16,821 --> 01:00:19,460
You actually get let get love and 
pleasure from it.

1325
01:00:19,461 --> 01:00:24,461
That's what I didn't understand.
I thought it even like the difficult 

1326
01:00:24,461 --> 01:00:27,910
times of raising kids.
I thought it would be stressful and it 

1327
01:00:27,910 --> 01:00:28,970
would be,
it would be something that you regret,

1328
01:00:29,180 --> 01:00:31,460
but you get like,
you get so much love from it.

1329
01:00:31,461 --> 01:00:33,320
It's so fun.
It's like you actually get.

1330
01:00:33,590 --> 01:00:36,410
It's rewarding.
That's what I didn't anticipate that.

1331
01:00:36,411 --> 01:00:39,590
It's like the fun involved in raising 
kids.

1332
01:00:39,620 --> 01:00:42,210
It's like if you're enjoying it,
you know,

1333
01:00:42,230 --> 01:00:45,350
and you're enjoying like raising them 
and talking to them and hanging out with

1334
01:00:45,351 --> 01:00:47,060
them and playing with them.
It's,

1335
01:00:47,061 --> 01:00:49,310
it's so rewarding.
I didn't anticipate that.

1336
01:00:49,311 --> 01:00:51,190
I thought it was just going to be,
you know,

1337
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:55,200
loving but difficult.
It's so much different than

1338
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:58,600
I thought that initially.
I mean the fact that you're.

1339
01:00:58,680 --> 01:01:03,680
This is not a slight against men like 
women are obviously more in tune with 

1340
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:04,690
being maternal and mothers and all that 
stuff,

1341
01:01:04,870 --> 01:01:07,300
so it's not about being a guy,
but do you think being a comic,

1342
01:01:07,660 --> 01:01:11,170
because when I watch comics that are 
fathers reluctant fathers,

1343
01:01:11,171 --> 01:01:16,171
not everyone planned to have a kid.
I was get the vibe that people hate 

1344
01:01:16,171 --> 01:01:16,480
their marriages,
hate their kids,

1345
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:19,270
so that's always the way I felt like,
oh,

1346
01:01:19,271 --> 01:01:21,340
I got this kid off my kids annoying and 
I'm like,

1347
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:25,150
do you think you felt that way?
Because a lot of your friends or whoever

1348
01:01:25,180 --> 01:01:29,960
you would watch when you were coming up 
had a disdain toward being a father.

1349
01:01:29,970 --> 01:01:31,830
Think as comics,
you know,

1350
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:37,000
we,
we're all can speak for the whole group 

1351
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:38,490
and say that we're pretty much all 
fucked up and super selfish,

1352
01:01:38,700 --> 01:01:41,160
super selfish and fucked up in one way 
or another.

1353
01:01:41,460 --> 01:01:42,040
You know,
I don't,

1354
01:01:42,340 --> 01:01:47,340
I don't know.
Everybody's got their own little kink 

1355
01:01:47,340 --> 01:01:47,340
and most,
for most of us,

1356
01:01:47,340 --> 01:01:49,470
it came from our childhood,
right?

1357
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:53,730
Most of us,
it came from either parents splitting up

1358
01:01:53,731 --> 01:01:58,731
or you know,
being ignored or weird shit that makes 

1359
01:01:58,731 --> 01:01:59,880
you want,
not all of us,

1360
01:01:59,881 --> 01:02:04,680
but the vast majority,
the overwhelming need to do it.

1361
01:02:04,681 --> 01:02:09,681
So much so that you'll,
you're willing to risk your self esteem 

1362
01:02:09,681 --> 01:02:09,681
by going onstage,
in front of strangers.

1363
01:02:09,681 --> 01:02:10,010
Right?
You know,

1364
01:02:10,170 --> 01:02:12,150
and I think when you've been through 
that,

1365
01:02:12,151 --> 01:02:17,151
you're automatically apprehensive as a 
potential parent of like recreating same

1366
01:02:19,411 --> 01:02:22,050
sort of environment that you had to 
experience when you were a child.

1367
01:02:22,230 --> 01:02:25,260
So you're really reluctant to be in some
situation where you,

1368
01:02:25,490 --> 01:02:30,490
you know,
you're gonna fuck up the same way 

1369
01:02:30,490 --> 01:02:30,490
someone fucked up with you.

1370
01:02:30,490 --> 01:02:30,490
Oh,
that's one way of looking at it.

1371
01:02:30,490 --> 01:02:31,590
Okay.
That is exactly how I looked at it.

1372
01:02:31,620 --> 01:02:36,620
You know?
And then there's also the part of being 

1373
01:02:36,620 --> 01:02:36,960
connected to this other person,
responsible for them,

1374
01:02:37,020 --> 01:02:39,330
not the baby,
the other person that you've made with,

1375
01:02:39,690 --> 01:02:44,690
um,
because you have to choose wisely 

1376
01:02:44,690 --> 01:02:47,090
because I have friends that have had 
babies with fucking crazy people and 

1377
01:02:47,090 --> 01:02:51,320
their life is chaos there.
Life is craziness and the woman is 

1378
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:54,951
constantly fucking with them and trying 
to make him jealous and doing horrible 

1379
01:02:54,951 --> 01:02:56,790
things and saying bad things to the kids
and it's just constant chaos,

1380
01:02:57,150 --> 01:03:02,150
you know?
And then he's got to always deal with 

1381
01:03:02,150 --> 01:03:03,681
the,
the new boyfriends and all these new 

1382
01:03:03,681 --> 01:03:06,351
guys that are run as kids.
Like I've seen people that have that 

1383
01:03:06,351 --> 01:03:08,520
have had kids with the wrong person and 
it's just been a disaster.

1384
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:09,510
So there's that too.

1385
01:03:10,090 --> 01:03:13,690
It's so weird because in my early 
twenties,

1386
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:15,540
like,
that's when you,

1387
01:03:15,541 --> 01:03:20,541
you know,
you're on your own for the first time 

1388
01:03:20,541 --> 01:03:21,991
and you're whatever I'm in say La and I 
would watch these male comics and a lot 

1389
01:03:21,991 --> 01:03:23,830
of them.
And I'm sure you and I know several,

1390
01:03:24,100 --> 01:03:27,430
we have several in common where some guy
probably in his forties,

1391
01:03:27,431 --> 01:03:30,490
just some woman and she happened to be 
the one that stuck around,

1392
01:03:30,491 --> 01:03:33,700
so now he's married and he's like,
you never hear him talk about his wife.

1393
01:03:33,701 --> 01:03:38,701
He kind of doesn't like her or he like 
had sex with a crazy girl and now they 

1394
01:03:38,701 --> 01:03:40,720
have a kid and he likes the kid,
but he hates the woman.

1395
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:45,900
And I think men get to dictate the way 
society feels about marriage because 

1396
01:03:46,301 --> 01:03:51,301
just being the stronger of the sexes and
whatever guys like is always like the 

1397
01:03:51,301 --> 01:03:51,301
cooler thing.

1398
01:03:51,301 --> 01:03:53,320
Girls are always,
no one ever wants to do the girl stuff.

1399
01:03:53,350 --> 01:03:58,350
What do you mean by that?
Like women always want to wear men's 

1400
01:03:58,350 --> 01:04:01,111
clothing.
Women want to go with the guys are 

1401
01:04:01,111 --> 01:04:01,111
always like,
guys,

1402
01:04:01,111 --> 01:04:04,861
you know,
girls always want to be part of the 

1403
01:04:04,861 --> 01:04:06,481
boy's club.
No guys knocking down the door to get 

1404
01:04:06,481 --> 01:04:08,721
in.
The girls club been like to be part of 

1405
01:04:08,721 --> 01:04:08,721
the,
you know,

1406
01:04:08,721 --> 01:04:09,970
we want our comedy is male centric and 
everything we do,

1407
01:04:09,971 --> 01:04:12,460
we want to be one of the guys.
And taken seriously like men,

1408
01:04:12,730 --> 01:04:17,380
so the view on kids and marriage,
you at least as a comic,

1409
01:04:17,381 --> 01:04:22,381
I'm watching them and they seem so 
unhappy so it all of a sudden becomes 

1410
01:04:22,381 --> 01:04:23,210
like uncool to have a baby.
And that's.

1411
01:04:23,290 --> 01:04:26,680
I've noticed a lot of girls saying 
things like,

1412
01:04:26,681 --> 01:04:28,600
I don't want to have kids.
I don't want to get married.

1413
01:04:28,601 --> 01:04:30,550
I don't want to be in a relationship the
fuck you don't.

1414
01:04:30,730 --> 01:04:32,290
You have to.
Of course you do.

1415
01:04:32,530 --> 01:04:37,530
It's just become the thing.
Does your to say that you don't want 

1416
01:04:37,530 --> 01:04:38,200
that because women think men find it 
more attractive.

1417
01:04:38,530 --> 01:04:41,260
Oh Wow.
How many women are running that game?

1418
01:04:41,720 --> 01:04:45,130
So pretend they don't want relationship 
or they think they don't.

1419
01:04:45,131 --> 01:04:50,131
I mean,
I host a show and I hear girls all the 

1420
01:04:50,131 --> 01:04:50,131
time and I'm looking at it.
You're a skank horror.

1421
01:04:50,131 --> 01:04:54,460
Like I'm looking at your eyeliner job.
Like I can tell that you saw dick a lot.

1422
01:04:54,620 --> 01:04:59,320
So I minor tells you that they suck.
A lot of it depends on the book and I've

1423
01:04:59,450 --> 01:05:02,560
loved it for the rest of us can tell you
going to wear like white eyeliner.

1424
01:05:02,561 --> 01:05:04,310
Your let's get serious.
Okay.

1425
01:05:04,570 --> 01:05:07,690
Girl with white island lashes.
It sounds like.

1426
01:05:08,580 --> 01:05:13,580
It depends.
It depends on where you have your 

1427
01:05:13,580 --> 01:05:13,580
makeup,
but I can tell by what you're wearing.

1428
01:05:13,580 --> 01:05:14,890
I can tell and then you hear them and 
they're like,

1429
01:05:14,891 --> 01:05:17,470
I don't want a relationship.
I don't want a guy checking up me.

1430
01:05:17,650 --> 01:05:18,160
You want

1431
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:23,160
the right that you're not immune to it 
and you say that because you want to 

1432
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:24,910
draw the guy in like,
oh really cool.

1433
01:05:24,911 --> 01:05:29,800
I'm totally no woman.
I mean I like my space,

1434
01:05:29,980 --> 01:05:34,980
but I would be upset if the man I was 
dating but never called me weird.

1435
01:05:35,830 --> 01:05:38,530
So grow.
But it's not necessarily her fault.

1436
01:05:38,620 --> 01:05:41,110
Yes.
How many at a time?

1437
01:05:41,250 --> 01:05:46,250
Uh,
I had a boyfriend and we lived together 

1438
01:05:46,691 --> 01:05:51,691
when I was 25 for about a year and then 
I had a boyfriend who visited for a 

1439
01:05:51,691 --> 01:05:55,981
summer and then I have a boyfriend who's
from months on end but never like we 

1440
01:05:56,651 --> 01:06:01,651
both signed the lease and it's always 
kills it when you're young or if you'd 

1441
01:06:01,660 --> 01:06:06,660
like to do that.
You should never do that when you're 

1442
01:06:06,660 --> 01:06:06,660
like,
I've never seen that.

1443
01:06:06,660 --> 01:06:08,890
I did that when I was 21.
It's totally killed our relationship.

1444
01:06:08,890 --> 01:06:10,090
I really loved her.
Before that,

1445
01:06:10,091 --> 01:06:11,980
she was fine.
I was like,

1446
01:06:11,990 --> 01:06:13,570
oh,
this is a disaster.

1447
01:06:13,630 --> 01:06:16,720
I guess it depends on the car.
I probably in the messier,

1448
01:06:16,870 --> 01:06:18,640
like I tend to date guys that are 
opposite me,

1449
01:06:18,641 --> 01:06:21,670
so I enjoy living with someone because 
I.

1450
01:06:21,671 --> 01:06:23,620
it's nice to have someone to hang out 
with and talk to.

1451
01:06:23,710 --> 01:06:27,130
That's nice if you find a good person,
but it's very difficult to do.

1452
01:06:27,131 --> 01:06:30,400
When you're 20,
21 you're saying you don't even know how

1453
01:06:30,401 --> 01:06:33,010
crazy you are until you live with 
something and then they let you know how

1454
01:06:33,011 --> 01:06:38,011
crazy you are.
Crazy as of late and it's great because 

1455
01:06:38,011 --> 01:06:38,560
then like as a girl,
if you like to bake,

1456
01:06:38,650 --> 01:06:43,650
then you can bake for them and you don't
have to eat it because guys will eat 

1457
01:06:43,650 --> 01:06:44,290
anything you like to bake and not eat 
things.

1458
01:06:44,830 --> 01:06:46,150
I like to.
I love baking.

1459
01:06:46,210 --> 01:06:49,120
It's Cathartic.
I have so fascinating.

1460
01:06:49,121 --> 01:06:53,530
Listen to your point of view as a,
an intelligent woman explained to us the

1461
01:06:53,531 --> 01:06:58,531
traps.
That chick setup that we already 

1462
01:06:58,531 --> 01:06:58,531
suspected.
We all knew it.

1463
01:06:58,531 --> 01:06:59,650
We've had these conversations with 
ourselves.

1464
01:07:00,430 --> 01:07:03,310
Tell me when a girl says to you,
I don't want relationship,

1465
01:07:03,430 --> 01:07:05,500
what do you think she's telling you we 
can fuck.

1466
01:07:05,530 --> 01:07:06,910
That's what she said.
It means two things.

1467
01:07:07,330 --> 01:07:10,010
She probably doesn't like if you're,
you may be gone on a couple of times.

1468
01:07:10,011 --> 01:07:10,810
She's like,
I'm just not ready.

1469
01:07:10,811 --> 01:07:12,450
She doesn't like it.
She does to you,

1470
01:07:12,980 --> 01:07:15,160
but it's a lure if she likes you.
And she's like,

1471
01:07:15,161 --> 01:07:16,450
no,
I'm totally cool.

1472
01:07:16,451 --> 01:07:19,450
Like she might be a cool girl,
but she does want a relationship.

1473
01:07:19,451 --> 01:07:24,451
No girl wants to be cool with you.
Just like sleeping with other girls and 

1474
01:07:24,451 --> 01:07:24,451
stuff like that.
And if she does,

1475
01:07:24,451 --> 01:07:25,180
she's got that issue.

1476
01:07:25,450 --> 01:07:30,450
What about girls?
Were this the one hot girl that has all 

1477
01:07:30,450 --> 01:07:31,660
these guy friends?
I can't do that.

1478
01:07:32,980 --> 01:07:35,070
That's a weird one.
I'm a tomboy.

1479
01:07:35,910 --> 01:07:38,890
When I wrote my cosmo article on,
I have that in there.

1480
01:07:38,910 --> 01:07:39,950
Oh really?
Yeah.

1481
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:41,740
Uh,
first of all,

1482
01:07:44,980 --> 01:07:49,240
as the girl who was always been a tomboy
and always had guy friends,

1483
01:07:50,500 --> 01:07:53,470
when you have a sick,
like a serious significant other,

1484
01:07:53,650 --> 01:07:58,650
it takes the place of the relationship 
you form with a lot of guys you don't 

1485
01:07:58,650 --> 01:07:59,620
need because you have that male 
influence in your life.

1486
01:07:59,621 --> 01:08:01,570
You don't,
you can't just ditch your friends.

1487
01:08:01,571 --> 01:08:03,880
You seem to need it more than most.
So you're very aggressive.

1488
01:08:05,390 --> 01:08:06,910
What's that about?
But your womanly,

1489
01:08:06,911 --> 01:08:09,490
you're not like Nike,
but you're very aggressive.

1490
01:08:10,120 --> 01:08:11,060
What is that about?
Know?

1491
01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:13,150
But it's a warm.
It's a warm,

1492
01:08:13,151 --> 01:08:15,880
friendly aggression.
Like I never feel around you.

1493
01:08:15,900 --> 01:08:19,090
You're always friendly,
but I can tell that you're like friendly

1494
01:08:19,091 --> 01:08:19,380
animal.

1495
01:08:19,460 --> 01:08:20,280
Yeah.
Well you're like,

1496
01:08:20,450 --> 01:08:23,330
you have a good competitor and some 
something athletic.

1497
01:08:23,800 --> 01:08:25,400
I wasn't afraid of getting punched in 
the face.

1498
01:08:25,401 --> 01:08:26,600
I could have been a really good fighter.
Oh,

1499
01:08:26,601 --> 01:08:29,240
well you just got to learn Jujitsu,
get get a good clench,

1500
01:08:29,241 --> 01:08:32,810
high guard d video game,
and start slowly with a good trainer.

1501
01:08:33,890 --> 01:08:35,240
How old are you now?
Twenty eight.

1502
01:08:35,330 --> 01:08:36,260
Damn.
It's not too late.

1503
01:08:36,261 --> 01:08:38,090
You can still get in there.
Not even Mario Kart.

1504
01:08:38,360 --> 01:08:39,470
No,
I don't do video games.

1505
01:08:39,471 --> 01:08:40,610
I don't pay.
Are you strong?

1506
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:42,260
I'm really strong.
Really?

1507
01:08:43,610 --> 01:08:44,480
Yeah,
but I'm a man.

1508
01:08:44,481 --> 01:08:47,900
You don't have guys that are met.
Not the same weight class either.

1509
01:08:47,930 --> 01:08:50,900
Can I punch too confident?
You could.

1510
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:52,940
You could.
If somebody taught you how to do it,

1511
01:08:52,941 --> 01:08:56,000
you could throw it killed my dog.
Your dog,

1512
01:08:56,140 --> 01:08:58,680
your my dog and your cat.
Whoa.

1513
01:08:59,380 --> 01:09:00,860
I bet your kid and killed my cat.

1514
01:09:00,860 --> 01:09:05,280
Not the male that he would fuck you up.
I actually wanted to take a class.

1515
01:09:05,550 --> 01:09:07,250
You would think you'd kill them.
Let's say you grabbed them.

1516
01:09:07,251 --> 01:09:12,251
They start when they bite.
You are such pussies for countless 

1517
01:09:12,251 --> 01:09:14,470
trying to kill you.
If a cow was like trying to kill you,

1518
01:09:15,270 --> 01:09:18,020
you think so?
If he got a hold of your neck,

1519
01:09:19,420 --> 01:09:21,800
what if he bit.
I'll drive it into the concrete.

1520
01:09:21,801 --> 01:09:22,860
Yeah,
but what if you're both dead?

1521
01:09:23,180 --> 01:09:26,350
What if you're both dead owner and 
you're gone?

1522
01:09:26,390 --> 01:09:27,710
It's a wrap,
but the cat.

1523
01:09:28,490 --> 01:09:30,650
You should have asked.
I want to take like a class.

1524
01:09:30,651 --> 01:09:31,760
I will go.
Maybe I'll tape it.

1525
01:09:31,761 --> 01:09:33,110
I'll go.
I want to take like one,

1526
01:09:34,070 --> 01:09:35,550
maybe like a boxing class.
Well,

1527
01:09:35,670 --> 01:09:37,700
no,
you don't tape it.

1528
01:09:37,730 --> 01:09:40,160
What you want to do is,
especially in the beginning,

1529
01:09:40,161 --> 01:09:45,161
you need someone to stand with you and 
and adjust things like adjust your 

1530
01:09:45,161 --> 01:09:48,581
shoulders,
adjust your hand position because 

1531
01:09:48,581 --> 01:09:50,681
especially in the beginning,
it's very important that you learn with 

1532
01:09:50,681 --> 01:09:52,110
proper technique because the foundation,
the principles that you learn,

1533
01:09:52,111 --> 01:09:53,750
the habits that you formed in the 
beginning,

1534
01:09:53,930 --> 01:09:56,480
a lot of times they stick with guys and 
they get really good.

1535
01:09:56,480 --> 01:09:59,300
So when they get tired they go back to 
their shitty technique.

1536
01:09:59,780 --> 01:10:01,970
So you have to learn correctly from the 
beginning.

1537
01:10:01,971 --> 01:10:03,320
You don't want to have to correct 
yourself.

1538
01:10:03,321 --> 01:10:04,880
So you're thinking while you're out 
there.

1539
01:10:05,030 --> 01:10:07,790
So from the beginning you only want to 
do it one way the correct way.

1540
01:10:08,030 --> 01:10:09,910
So if you really want to learn how to do
it,

1541
01:10:09,980 --> 01:10:10,640
where do you live?
Well,

1542
01:10:10,641 --> 01:10:12,490
don't tell me on the air in Hollywood 
shit.

1543
01:10:13,050 --> 01:10:14,180
Fuck.
Are you doing?

1544
01:10:14,410 --> 01:10:18,890
They're going to find you.
Why do you live in the devil's ball sack

1545
01:10:18,920 --> 01:10:20,150
one?
Why do you live right there?

1546
01:10:20,540 --> 01:10:22,520
Just because you live in like a really 
nice neighborhood,

1547
01:10:22,810 --> 01:10:27,810
but like Hollywood is taking it dirty.
Like I'm surprised that you're not like 

1548
01:10:27,810 --> 01:10:27,810
Burbank.

1549
01:10:29,500 --> 01:10:32,030
Burbank.
Exactly.

1550
01:10:33,290 --> 01:10:38,290
Burbank in his butt hole was a nice 
place.

1551
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:40,130
Dinner.
It's relaxing.

1552
01:10:40,131 --> 01:10:42,350
I don't have to worry about people 
fucking peeing on me.

1553
01:10:42,470 --> 01:10:47,470
How much is your rent a month?
A two bedroom apartment is $1,400

1554
01:10:48,820 --> 01:10:49,990
rent.
I have a mortgage yet.

1555
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:53,240
But have you bought a place in 
Hollywood?

1556
01:10:53,550 --> 01:10:57,230
Did you get a condo or a condo?
That's not bad.

1557
01:10:57,231 --> 01:11:02,231
Why?
Just say like smart and the area is 

1558
01:11:02,231 --> 01:11:03,200
getting better.
Eighties Hood.

1559
01:11:04,210 --> 01:11:07,040
Somebody had a,
it was one of those TV shows.

1560
01:11:07,041 --> 01:11:09,330
They show the insides of people's houses
and uh,

1561
01:11:09,390 --> 01:11:11,810
like Paris Hilton or someone famous like
that might not have been her,

1562
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:14,000
but someone had a one of apartments in

1563
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:15,800
on,
on Wilshire,

1564
01:11:15,970 --> 01:11:19,260
you know those penthouses on Wilshire 
Boulevard where they have like valets.

1565
01:11:19,261 --> 01:11:22,650
They have like 24 hour concierge,
like the older,

1566
01:11:22,680 --> 01:11:26,820
like all the way to Santa Monica on the 
way to say it was really nice one.

1567
01:11:26,830 --> 01:11:29,330
Yeah.
The super duper luxury apartments.

1568
01:11:29,700 --> 01:11:34,700
This was the dopest view.
Like I didn't know what kind of view 

1569
01:11:34,700 --> 01:11:37,491
these,
there's no views like this in La and 

1570
01:11:37,491 --> 01:11:37,491
it's so high that you know,
you're,

1571
01:11:37,491 --> 01:11:39,570
you're way up there in this tower 
looking over the city.

1572
01:11:39,571 --> 01:11:40,200
I'm like,
wow,

1573
01:11:40,410 --> 01:11:43,020
I'm not really into living in the city,
but if I was,

1574
01:11:43,050 --> 01:11:47,220
this would be with the shit areas.
I feel like it's where your grandparents

1575
01:11:47,221 --> 01:11:50,070
lived that I would want to have an 
office in that place.

1576
01:11:50,190 --> 01:11:55,190
I looked at it and the thing I thought I
would want to buy one of those 

1577
01:11:55,190 --> 01:11:55,190
apartments and use it as an office.

1578
01:11:55,190 --> 01:11:56,430
That'd be amazing.
But they're really expensive.

1579
01:11:56,431 --> 01:12:01,431
They're stupid.
They're like 20 million bucks or 

1580
01:12:01,431 --> 01:12:03,501
something crazy.
It's on the west side is as bad as the 

1581
01:12:03,501 --> 01:12:03,501
west side.
Then there's no comedy clubs over there.

1582
01:12:03,501 --> 01:12:04,580
That's true.
There's no.

1583
01:12:04,690 --> 01:12:06,960
I mean for the most part,
everything I need is in Hollywood.

1584
01:12:07,500 --> 01:12:09,580
That kind of dictated where I bought 
something I liked to.

1585
01:12:09,650 --> 01:12:13,770
Because you have the luxury of living 
farther out.

1586
01:12:13,771 --> 01:12:15,780
You have a bit more control over your 
career than I do,

1587
01:12:16,240 --> 01:12:21,240
but you have to go to Hollywood all the 
time almost every night and you have 

1588
01:12:22,410 --> 01:12:27,410
your gig set or you don't.
You're not auditioning like a crazy 

1589
01:12:27,410 --> 01:12:27,600
blind move.
I moved down here 10 minute drive.

1590
01:12:28,520 --> 01:12:32,010
Tango grows.
Why Burbank?

1591
01:12:32,011 --> 01:12:36,480
It's not cool.
It's I'm living just to have a quiet.

1592
01:12:36,630 --> 01:12:38,570
I can go in my backyard and be quiet 
night.

1593
01:12:38,571 --> 01:12:41,040
I can.
I can have parking everywhere.

1594
01:12:41,230 --> 01:12:43,350
You have a backyard fenced in.
Okay,

1595
01:12:43,351 --> 01:12:45,360
cool.
So you can just plan your funeral now.

1596
01:12:46,060 --> 01:12:47,010
Plenty.
Your funeral.

1597
01:12:48,660 --> 01:12:50,280
I go to Hollywood.
Takes 10 minutes.

1598
01:12:50,281 --> 01:12:52,680
I'm on fucking sunset.
I just hang out in Sun.

1599
01:12:52,770 --> 01:12:56,070
Then I drive back home to my nice quiet 
castle was that,

1600
01:12:56,071 --> 01:13:01,071
but instead of going and staying in the 
party that's in the center up all night 

1601
01:13:01,771 --> 01:13:03,690
while people are torturing your house,
if you like.

1602
01:13:03,691 --> 01:13:04,710
Um,
Manhattan.

1603
01:13:04,770 --> 01:13:06,490
Do you like that kind of city in New 
York?

1604
01:13:06,540 --> 01:13:07,910
Do you really?
Would you live in Manhattan?

1605
01:13:08,150 --> 01:13:13,150
What I've missed,
like if I were to move there now it 

1606
01:13:13,150 --> 01:13:15,771
would kind of be like I'd have.
It wouldn't help me and be like a 

1607
01:13:15,771 --> 01:13:18,621
lateral move because it's not like I'm.
I always think it's so funny when you 

1608
01:13:18,621 --> 01:13:21,970
might actually be a step down.
You have to start over with the comedy 

1609
01:13:21,970 --> 01:13:21,970
clubs and everything.

1610
01:13:21,970 --> 01:13:25,490
I think it's so funny.
When I meet girls like actresses or 

1611
01:13:25,490 --> 01:13:25,490
other hosts,
they're like,

1612
01:13:25,490 --> 01:13:25,490
I'm back coastal.
I'm like,

1613
01:13:25,490 --> 01:13:25,740
oh,
really?

1614
01:13:25,830 --> 01:13:28,200
Is New York just calling you just every 
month?

1615
01:13:28,201 --> 01:13:30,640
You got to go back heads.
Don't know.

1616
01:13:30,720 --> 01:13:33,180
You fly to Florida once a year to visit 
your parents.

1617
01:13:33,210 --> 01:13:36,090
You're not bi coastal.
I was bi coastal for about two months,

1618
01:13:36,530 --> 01:13:39,690
two apartments,
so I'd fly back.

1619
01:13:39,691 --> 01:13:41,400
I'm like,
why don't even have this fucking place?

1620
01:13:41,700 --> 01:13:46,700
Especially when you deal with the first 
winter and get a nice winter in 

1621
01:13:46,700 --> 01:13:46,700
California.
Like,

1622
01:13:46,700 --> 01:13:49,380
what the fuck am I doing?
My whole family's from New York.

1623
01:13:49,560 --> 01:13:50,480
Really?
Actually,

1624
01:13:51,440 --> 01:13:53,580
they're all from New York City.
The city people.

1625
01:13:53,610 --> 01:13:58,610
I mean they start then and there from 
long island and those are the various 

1626
01:13:58,610 --> 01:14:00,971
trainings.
People who are born and raised in New 

1627
01:14:00,971 --> 01:14:00,971
York City,
the city,

1628
01:14:00,971 --> 01:14:03,360
the animal,
they don't understand.

1629
01:14:03,420 --> 01:14:05,530
They don't understand a lot of parts of 
the world today.

1630
01:14:05,560 --> 01:14:07,460
I don't even know what a pizza is.
Don't.

1631
01:14:08,010 --> 01:14:10,920
A lot of them don't drive.
Don't ever drive.

1632
01:14:10,950 --> 01:14:12,040
They don't ever get licensed

1633
01:14:13,380 --> 01:14:14,830
so they want to go somewhere on 
vacation.

1634
01:14:14,831 --> 01:14:16,910
It's a real pain in the ass.
You have to go get a driver's license.

1635
01:14:16,911 --> 01:14:21,911
They take driving classes and learned 
how to drive and then when they're on 

1636
01:14:21,911 --> 01:14:23,350
the road somewhere they're incompetent.
They really shouldn't be driving because

1637
01:14:23,351 --> 01:14:28,351
it's its own microcosm,
but I do relate to how aggressive New 

1638
01:14:28,351 --> 01:14:30,310
Yorkers are and the like the how 
forceful they are when they taught.

1639
01:14:30,320 --> 01:14:33,490
Like I like that because I feel like 
that's how I come off.

1640
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:36,600
Do you like like really calm men?
Yeah.

1641
01:14:36,780 --> 01:14:37,440
Yeah.
You like,

1642
01:14:37,450 --> 01:14:41,190
like dudes are like sweeties want to rub
your feet and not,

1643
01:14:41,370 --> 01:14:43,560
not pussies,
but just very mellow.

1644
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:46,440
Very important.
You're very much right.

1645
01:14:46,460 --> 01:14:48,340
Yeah,
but I mean I'm not like in bed,

1646
01:14:48,341 --> 01:14:50,220
like don't look at me,
turn it right.

1647
01:14:50,221 --> 01:14:53,080
Like it's on your book and they can be 
aggressive,

1648
01:14:53,081 --> 01:14:54,070
like a quiet aggressive.

1649
01:14:54,160 --> 01:14:59,160
You can't be on top,
but you only like two minutes of a sex 

1650
01:14:59,160 --> 01:15:01,750
at a time and let's get very tired after
you have to pee a lot so you can have 

1651
01:15:02,661 --> 01:15:04,660
sex for like,
oh,

1652
01:15:04,680 --> 01:15:06,520
went all night.
I ain't got it.

1653
01:15:06,580 --> 01:15:11,360
You just don't enjoy it.
There's girls out there that are free or

1654
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:15,460
they probably were white eyeliner.
Why say why not?

1655
01:15:15,461 --> 01:15:20,461
Why do you have to hate?
Why can't they just be different than 

1656
01:15:20,461 --> 01:15:21,370
you can you just enjoy your two minutes 
and they enjoy the couple hours.

1657
01:15:21,560 --> 01:15:24,510
That's fair.
Cowboy touch.

1658
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:27,730
Your girls like getting fucked all the 
time.

1659
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:31,000
There's just some freaky bitches.
Crazy amounts of.

1660
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:34,450
Was this the one that you all left your 
podcast early?

1661
01:15:35,290 --> 01:15:36,100
Oh,
that's sad.

1662
01:15:36,101 --> 01:15:39,050
Girl that sat next to you on the 
icehouse chronicles podcast,

1663
01:15:39,060 --> 01:15:40,060
right?
Yeah,

1664
01:15:40,070 --> 01:15:41,560
that was.
I walked in and you were like,

1665
01:15:41,561 --> 01:15:43,310
what the fuck are you talking about?
Right when I walked in,

1666
01:15:43,340 --> 01:15:44,470
you were going after.
I was like,

1667
01:15:44,500 --> 01:15:46,390
oh no.
What do we keep saying?

1668
01:15:46,391 --> 01:15:47,570
They're like,
you gave it to her.

1669
01:15:49,520 --> 01:15:51,600
You were polite.
You are being mean,

1670
01:15:52,370 --> 01:15:57,370
but you were laughing.
There was some certain things that she 

1671
01:15:57,370 --> 01:15:58,510
was saying.
That's the way it was.

1672
01:15:58,890 --> 01:16:01,090
That's all it is.
It was just sad.

1673
01:16:01,240 --> 01:16:06,240
You know that that same.
That's like really obvious struggle for 

1674
01:16:06,240 --> 01:16:10,120
attention by being overly sexual to put 
that podcast never was released.

1675
01:16:11,120 --> 01:16:11,890
Yeah.

1676
01:16:14,270 --> 01:16:15,380
I always just.
You know what?

1677
01:16:15,470 --> 01:16:20,470
It's fun to talk about sex,
but I honestly feel that a straight up 

1678
01:16:20,470 --> 01:16:23,851
sexual,
it can be the lowest form of 

1679
01:16:23,851 --> 01:16:23,851
communication,
especially between men and women.

1680
01:16:23,851 --> 01:16:28,170
Like if all else fails,
you can always talk about how you get 

1681
01:16:28,170 --> 01:16:29,260
off and so when we go right to that it's
like,

1682
01:16:29,261 --> 01:16:34,261
oh,
we're not going to attempt to discuss 

1683
01:16:34,261 --> 01:16:34,261
anything.
Alright,

1684
01:16:34,261 --> 01:16:34,261
sure.
Quite hitting on me.

1685
01:16:34,660 --> 01:16:37,510
I'm sure everyone listening,
we get hit on a lot by women.

1686
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:42,040
I don't put myself in situations where 
lesbians are coming at me.

1687
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:47,400
No,
I mean like you have to have a fan base 

1688
01:16:47,400 --> 01:16:48,370
of women that are lesbians.
Do you ever get girls and say,

1689
01:16:48,430 --> 01:16:50,920
I don't want just like you.
And then I figured it out.

1690
01:16:50,980 --> 01:16:55,980
Fuck man.
Meet me at sunset and I have come to the

1691
01:16:57,251 --> 01:16:58,300
show.
Really.

1692
01:16:58,680 --> 01:17:00,280
I mean,
not like in droves,

1693
01:17:00,281 --> 01:17:03,100
but would you have sex with rosie if,
if it was offered,

1694
01:17:04,360 --> 01:17:04,960
offered?

1695
01:17:05,450 --> 01:17:10,450
No,
but I do think people are a little hard 

1696
01:17:10,450 --> 01:17:10,450
on her.
She's not.

1697
01:17:10,450 --> 01:17:11,290
She's a heavy woman,
but it's not like she's repugnant,

1698
01:17:11,310 --> 01:17:13,400
like whatever.
She's very nice.

1699
01:17:13,550 --> 01:17:15,770
I'm sure she is.
I really enjoyed talking to her.

1700
01:17:16,470 --> 01:17:21,470
I was really looking forward to.
I flew in really early just to do our 

1701
01:17:21,470 --> 01:17:21,950
show.
I had like a 6:00

1702
01:17:21,950 --> 01:17:22,770
AM flight.
She's,

1703
01:17:23,220 --> 01:17:25,580
I mean she's been around.
She's putting in the work member.

1704
01:17:25,820 --> 01:17:27,410
She's nice.
Was it exit to Eden?

1705
01:17:27,420 --> 01:17:30,290
Wasn't one where the snm club or the.
Yeah,

1706
01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:36,440
I remember.
I remember the scene where she was 

1707
01:17:36,440 --> 01:17:36,710
dressed up in the crazy output leather 
bullshit.

1708
01:17:36,940 --> 01:17:40,670
Then choosing like the Flintstones to 
her crying in baseball.

1709
01:17:41,060 --> 01:17:42,040
You're so good enough.

1710
01:17:45,950 --> 01:17:50,950
At the moment she played the mentally 
challenged girl on the bus riding the 

1711
01:17:50,950 --> 01:17:52,680
bus with my sister.
Oh my God.

1712
01:17:56,960 --> 01:18:01,960
Oh my God.
That had all their shitty movies and 

1713
01:18:04,040 --> 01:18:06,890
Mcdowell who I think is the worst fake 
southern,

1714
01:18:07,090 --> 01:18:12,090
like worst thing ever.
Rosie O'donnell is retarded in this 

1715
01:18:12,090 --> 01:18:15,941
movie and what I don't buy about it is 
that she's a mean retard and retarded 

1716
01:18:15,941 --> 01:18:17,400
people aren't mean.
She's amazing.

1717
01:18:17,401 --> 01:18:22,401
She's mean and smart and sarcastic one.
So it's just like rosie o'donnell,

1718
01:18:22,461 --> 01:18:24,770
but a little slower.
Oh No.

1719
01:18:25,130 --> 01:18:27,960
Like it was just like she was like,
you want.

1720
01:18:28,010 --> 01:18:31,790
He didn't like her really as a.
She was like a mean retard.

1721
01:18:33,190 --> 01:18:35,990
You Watch this movie and it just.
There was nothing to her face.

1722
01:18:35,991 --> 01:18:39,080
Did it look retarded?
She was just like bitchy.

1723
01:18:39,170 --> 01:18:41,420
So she was just,
she came off like a stupid person,

1724
01:18:41,560 --> 01:18:46,560
you know?
I consulted whenever a person who's not 

1725
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:47,870
really mentally challenged plays a 
person who's mentally challenged.

1726
01:18:48,470 --> 01:18:51,570
Was the movie Pacific,
whatever the fuck it was were.

1727
01:18:52,480 --> 01:18:54,890
What's his name?
Downey.

1728
01:18:55,220 --> 01:18:56,930
Robert Downey says,
never go.

1729
01:18:56,931 --> 01:18:58,600
Full Retard.
Oh,

1730
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:04,360
thunder.
Opposite of Tropical Pacific Retard 

1731
01:19:04,360 --> 01:19:04,740
because he played simple Jack Sippel 
jacket.

1732
01:19:05,060 --> 01:19:06,090
Never go.
Full Retard.

1733
01:19:06,700 --> 01:19:07,880
Retard.
Come on.

1734
01:19:07,881 --> 01:19:08,810
I mean,
it's so true.

1735
01:19:08,811 --> 01:19:11,000
Every time someone does,
but people try it.

1736
01:19:11,060 --> 01:19:12,560
Everyone thinks they're good enough to 
try it.

1737
01:19:12,860 --> 01:19:14,670
Even fucking Sean Penn went there.
Was it?

1738
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:19,800
I think they do.
You can have brain damage and not be 

1739
01:19:19,800 --> 01:19:22,440
because if you're retarded,
your face will look different and their 

1740
01:19:22,440 --> 01:19:24,581
faces are all still stunning.
Mean Down Syndrome going to be retarded 

1741
01:19:24,581 --> 01:19:26,810
without having to have a problem with,
you know,

1742
01:19:26,840 --> 01:19:30,440
like even the word retard has been kind 
of distracted from the vernacular,

1743
01:19:30,590 --> 01:19:31,020
you know,
we're,

1744
01:19:31,050 --> 01:19:32,780
we're saying we're throwing it around 
real easy.

1745
01:19:32,790 --> 01:19:34,790
We're going to Piss a lot of people off.
Just retards that.

1746
01:19:34,791 --> 01:19:35,180
Listen here.

1747
01:19:37,640 --> 01:19:42,640
It's a tricky word now.
It didn't use to be and it doesn't mean 

1748
01:19:42,640 --> 01:19:42,640
down syndrome.
Well it does.

1749
01:19:42,640 --> 01:19:43,640
In this rosie o'donnell,
chase,

1750
01:19:43,670 --> 01:19:46,190
what retarded actually means slow.
Like in music,

1751
01:19:46,191 --> 01:19:48,770
you have a retard retard out when things
go slow.

1752
01:19:48,771 --> 01:19:51,710
So taken up with the Italians will.
It should not only that,

1753
01:19:51,711 --> 01:19:52,220
the,
you know,

1754
01:19:52,221 --> 01:19:52,880
the,
the,

1755
01:19:52,881 --> 01:19:56,300
the fire has been retarded.
You can say that.

1756
01:19:56,360 --> 01:19:59,060
Okay.
And I retired in chip.

1757
01:19:59,950 --> 01:20:00,890
Well couldn't use it.
Yes.

1758
01:20:00,891 --> 01:20:02,150
It retardant,
yes.

1759
01:20:02,151 --> 01:20:06,140
But couldn't you say the fire has been 
retarded because of the,

1760
01:20:06,141 --> 01:20:06,570
uh,
the,

1761
01:20:06,571 --> 01:20:08,250
the gas we are spraying

1762
01:20:08,250 --> 01:20:09,720
on it.
The fire's been retarded.

1763
01:20:09,721 --> 01:20:14,721
You could say that.
It wouldn't necessarily buy is this.

1764
01:20:17,560 --> 01:20:20,190
This is crazy,
crazy retarded.

1765
01:20:20,191 --> 01:20:21,210
Yo.
We taught it.

1766
01:20:24,360 --> 01:20:29,360
Yeah.
Well I had this woman came up to me 

1767
01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:29,360
after a show once where I used to do 
that bit about knowing the arc,

1768
01:20:29,850 --> 01:20:31,590
you know,
I do this bit about knowing the arch and

1769
01:20:31,591 --> 01:20:34,350
the bit.
Was that an eight year old retarded boy.

1770
01:20:34,351 --> 01:20:37,650
You can tell him the story of Noah in 
the Ark and he would have some questions

1771
01:20:38,420 --> 01:20:43,420
and he was so you would tell like I had 
the best storytellers in the world who 

1772
01:20:43,420 --> 01:20:43,750
told this incredible story that no one 
arc.

1773
01:20:43,950 --> 01:20:46,230
And then the eight year old retired boy 
will go,

1774
01:20:46,260 --> 01:20:51,260
oh,
there's a lot of holes in the kid sits 

1775
01:20:51,260 --> 01:20:51,370
down.
It just breaks down Noah's our.

1776
01:20:52,020 --> 01:20:53,850
I had this woman come up to me after a 
show and she goes,

1777
01:20:53,851 --> 01:20:57,270
I thought that was really funny except 
the fact that I have a retarded son,

1778
01:20:57,930 --> 01:20:58,580
whatever.

1779
01:20:59,280 --> 01:21:00,000
And I'm like,
you know,

1780
01:21:00,001 --> 01:21:01,710
I don't know what to tell you.
You know?

1781
01:21:01,770 --> 01:21:03,070
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

1782
01:21:03,250 --> 01:21:05,340
I'm not really making fun of retarded 
people.

1783
01:21:05,430 --> 01:21:09,240
I'm sort of saying smart.
Well I know it's.

1784
01:21:09,720 --> 01:21:11,690
We have to sort of admit in,
in,

1785
01:21:11,790 --> 01:21:13,110
in,
in any,

1786
01:21:13,170 --> 01:21:16,290
like anything you do that's creative.
It's supposed to be an expression of how

1787
01:21:16,291 --> 01:21:18,210
you view life and the culture,
right?

1788
01:21:18,540 --> 01:21:21,510
We are.
We supposed to never use retarded people

1789
01:21:21,511 --> 01:21:24,480
because they don't exist.
We can't use him as an example.

1790
01:21:24,680 --> 01:21:28,890
What she was laughing at all the other 
jokes that of yourself and others.

1791
01:21:28,891 --> 01:21:30,930
So.
So when it pertains to you,

1792
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:34,720
we have taken exception.
I could see people in regular returning,

1793
01:21:35,320 --> 01:21:39,270
like we're now are people that make fun 
of themselves.

1794
01:21:39,690 --> 01:21:44,690
What I was doing obviously is actually 
including a retarded person in my act 

1795
01:21:45,270 --> 01:21:48,930
and that's where saying it,
she's retarded.

1796
01:21:49,680 --> 01:21:51,360
Stupid.
I don't know man.

1797
01:21:51,361 --> 01:21:56,361
If that was your kid,
I think you would want someone to know 

1798
01:21:56,361 --> 01:21:57,120
that it hurts.
I understand where she was coming from.

1799
01:21:57,180 --> 01:21:59,490
I have a friend who's a comic there and 
she's very funny.

1800
01:21:59,491 --> 01:22:03,270
I'm one of her sons is autistic and 
because she's a comic sheet,

1801
01:22:03,360 --> 01:22:08,360
not make fun of him,
but she has a sense of humor about it 

1802
01:22:08,360 --> 01:22:09,670
and like her email is rain mom instead 
of rain.

1803
01:22:09,671 --> 01:22:10,090
Man,
you know,

1804
01:22:10,240 --> 01:22:12,840
she gets it and she makes jokes at his 
expense,

1805
01:22:12,841 --> 01:22:17,841
but then he's very,
she treats him like an adult and so 

1806
01:22:17,841 --> 01:22:18,960
there's,
you can be one of those people that gets

1807
01:22:18,961 --> 01:22:23,961
it and gets their,
how they fit into the world or you can 

1808
01:22:23,961 --> 01:22:23,961
be weird and be like,
oh,

1809
01:22:23,961 --> 01:22:24,860
well he's retarded,
so no one can say that.

1810
01:22:25,380 --> 01:22:27,390
We weren't talking about her son and his
Pacific.

1811
01:22:27,391 --> 01:22:32,280
We were talking about me making fun of 
the fact that she had an issue with that

1812
01:22:32,281 --> 01:22:34,470
is stupid.
Kind of see her point a little bit.

1813
01:22:34,500 --> 01:22:39,180
I stopped doing the bid because I got it
onto a CD or DVD.

1814
01:22:39,400 --> 01:22:41,700
Right.
But I would've kept doing.

1815
01:22:41,701 --> 01:22:46,701
That was funny.
It was the point,

1816
01:22:47,851 --> 01:22:49,440
man.
He was the hero in a bit.

1817
01:22:49,610 --> 01:22:51,480
Yeah.
He was the smart one.

1818
01:22:51,750 --> 01:22:54,690
Who was the one who wasn't getting 
fooled by this stupid fucking book.

1819
01:22:55,610 --> 01:22:56,100
Coffee.
Yeah.

1820
01:22:56,850 --> 01:22:57,930
Yeah.
I don't know man.

1821
01:22:57,931 --> 01:23:00,300
It's A.
I could see it from her point of view.

1822
01:23:00,301 --> 01:23:01,890
Especially if someone was being 
malicious.

1823
01:23:02,310 --> 01:23:04,950
No,
you can't obviously do what you want but

1824
01:23:05,080 --> 01:23:06,010
can't harp on the

1825
01:23:06,010 --> 01:23:08,130
exception.
And that's true too.

1826
01:23:08,210 --> 01:23:11,110
Comedy's about generalizing.
I know and it would be nice if everybody

1827
01:23:11,111 --> 01:23:12,350
had a fucking sense of humor,
right?

1828
01:23:12,780 --> 01:23:14,590
Retarded son.
Then we can all just fucking make fun of

1829
01:23:14,591 --> 01:23:19,591
them every time people want to like you 
can bring it back again.

1830
01:23:21,940 --> 01:23:23,950
Just poop on you and then you put your 
crazy dog.

1831
01:23:24,190 --> 01:23:26,050
You're a crazy dog lady.
Yes.

1832
01:23:26,350 --> 01:23:28,740
Obviously it's fine.
You need to learn some more kid.

1833
01:23:29,990 --> 01:23:33,130
Be More of a grappler or kickboxer.
Anything to throw.

1834
01:23:33,220 --> 01:23:34,420
Throw Duke.
So girls,

1835
01:23:34,750 --> 01:23:36,050
what do you think you'd like to choke a 
bitch?

1836
01:23:36,051 --> 01:23:37,390
I'll tell you the truth.
Tell me the truth.

1837
01:23:37,900 --> 01:23:42,900
I think punching is more useful but no 
one expects you to kick him and take him

1838
01:23:43,091 --> 01:23:45,190
to the ground on a Saturday night 
waiting in line.

1839
01:23:45,300 --> 01:23:46,510
Inside.
True.

1840
01:23:46,750 --> 01:23:51,750
So I don't know.
I think I'd have to take an aptitude 

1841
01:23:51,750 --> 01:23:55,201
test,
like a physical aptitude test to see 

1842
01:23:55,201 --> 01:23:55,201
which of my limbs is quicker and then 
we'll just play to that strength,

1843
01:23:56,050 --> 01:23:59,860
physical aptitude test to see which of 
your limbs better with kicking.

1844
01:23:59,860 --> 01:24:01,960
And my quicker,
my quicker with punching like which am I

1845
01:24:01,961 --> 01:24:04,510
better at?
Nobody naturally predisposed to the only

1846
01:24:04,511 --> 01:24:09,511
issue with kicking as it takes a while 
to get good at it and you have to think 

1847
01:24:09,511 --> 01:24:09,511
about,
yeah,

1848
01:24:09,511 --> 01:24:11,110
you're going to get kicked,
kicked in the legs to do it correctly,

1849
01:24:11,111 --> 01:24:13,630
you've got to learn how to leg kick and 
you've got to learn a balance.

1850
01:24:13,631 --> 01:24:18,631
You have to have really good balance 
because otherwise someone's going to 

1851
01:24:18,631 --> 01:24:20,911
take you down.
It's easier to take someone down when 

1852
01:24:20,911 --> 01:24:21,590
they're kicking,
especially if chicken into the body or I

1853
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:26,600
don't ever plan on being in a fight.
It would be nice to know how to defend 

1854
01:24:26,600 --> 01:24:29,431
myself in case somebody gets crazy,
but I don't want to get kicked in the 

1855
01:24:29,431 --> 01:24:30,430
Shin.
That's good thinking.

1856
01:24:31,120 --> 01:24:32,510
That's good to think that way.
Yeah.

1857
01:24:32,600 --> 01:24:34,810
You don't want you to kicking the leg 
kick in the thighs.

1858
01:24:34,811 --> 01:24:38,130
It's really hurt or a lot of times you 
get kicked in the CAF,

1859
01:24:38,180 --> 01:24:40,470
like the lower shin,
like the fibula,

1860
01:24:40,490 --> 01:24:45,490
the little skinny bone Tibia and fibula 
dudes will kick the shit out of the 

1861
01:24:45,490 --> 01:24:47,260
outside of your outside of your calf.

1862
01:24:47,820 --> 01:24:49,580
What they should do,
instead of having tasers,

1863
01:24:49,720 --> 01:24:54,720
they should have.
They should have little necklaces with 

1864
01:24:54,720 --> 01:24:57,161
like little vials that are just filled 
with aids blood and then everyone knows 

1865
01:24:57,161 --> 01:24:57,470
what that is and so if somebody is 
attacking me like,

1866
01:24:57,471 --> 01:24:58,370
Hey,
I got my blood,

1867
01:24:58,460 --> 01:25:03,130
don't make me throw this on myself.
That would be.

1868
01:25:03,131 --> 01:25:08,131
Yeah,
throw it in their face and their eyes 

1869
01:25:08,131 --> 01:25:08,131
and stuff.
You still wouldn't want it to happen.

1870
01:25:08,131 --> 01:25:09,650
Right?
But it's a little tiny vial.

1871
01:25:09,651 --> 01:25:12,420
I would take my chances,
but it's related to your violent open to

1872
01:25:12,421 --> 01:25:13,760
that.
I think I'd beat your ass.

1873
01:25:13,790 --> 01:25:16,870
I think I would rather have aids blood 
thrown in my face.

1874
01:25:16,980 --> 01:25:19,400
You unscrewing a vial?
No,

1875
01:25:19,401 --> 01:25:21,750
I don't think you'd get a guy with a 
vial.

1876
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:24,620
How big is it?
Just like a little.

1877
01:25:24,621 --> 01:25:26,420
You know,
like those little perfume samples.

1878
01:25:26,510 --> 01:25:27,650
Dude,
if that broke on you.

1879
01:25:27,650 --> 01:25:29,730
What if somebody opened a door on it?
What if.

1880
01:25:30,880 --> 01:25:34,240
What if it's like a titanium.
It's a cool kills.

1881
01:25:34,280 --> 01:25:37,310
Someone like you,
you'll go to jail for that.

1882
01:25:37,311 --> 01:25:41,510
If you willingly knowingly give someone 
a attacking you,

1883
01:25:41,540 --> 01:25:43,070
you could just say you just threw some 
blood.

1884
01:25:43,071 --> 01:25:44,290
Adam.
Why not just have.

1885
01:25:44,450 --> 01:25:46,370
That's better than like if somebody 
attacked me,

1886
01:25:46,371 --> 01:25:47,540
you're allowed to shoot them.
Right.

1887
01:25:47,810 --> 01:25:49,220
If you say,
hey,

1888
01:25:49,221 --> 01:25:49,630
yeah,
he.

1889
01:25:49,660 --> 01:25:51,230
He attacked me.
I think some blood on him.

1890
01:25:51,231 --> 01:25:53,280
I think that's less than shooting 
science attack.

1891
01:25:54,290 --> 01:25:58,610
The dumbest thing I've ever walked the 
face of the earth.

1892
01:25:58,700 --> 01:26:03,700
You really are the same age.
Blood probably is cheap and like a guy 

1893
01:26:03,700 --> 01:26:06,791
that has aids could sell his blood and 
make his own weapons for you and then 

1894
01:26:06,791 --> 01:26:07,370
that could help him pay his bills for 
having aids.

1895
01:26:08,180 --> 01:26:10,430
Wow.
Why wouldn't you?

1896
01:26:10,431 --> 01:26:13,310
Instead of giving him aids kinsmen 
that'll mess with them temporarily.

1897
01:26:13,311 --> 01:26:14,780
Like mercury poison.
You can't look.

1898
01:26:14,781 --> 01:26:19,781
You can't talk to him.
He goes this far out and fucking spazzy 

1899
01:26:19,781 --> 01:26:21,130
have aids and you're looking for ways to
make money.

1900
01:26:21,290 --> 01:26:26,290
Make money.
His brain has aids only his brain in the

1901
01:26:26,670 --> 01:26:29,980
part of his brain,
that forum sentencing support as aids.

1902
01:26:30,470 --> 01:26:33,760
It's a very specific form of AIDS.
It only hits.

1903
01:26:34,040 --> 01:26:37,220
He hits one area of the brain,
the form logical sentences.

1904
01:26:37,740 --> 01:26:39,200
That part as ever.
Thank you.

1905
01:26:39,230 --> 01:26:41,990
Had AIDS at the time.
I had an aids test.

1906
01:26:42,050 --> 01:26:43,610
What?
I got health insurance.

1907
01:26:43,640 --> 01:26:45,260
The first time I had health insurance,
I was like 23.

1908
01:26:45,261 --> 01:26:48,090
I was terrified.
Nervous.

1909
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:50,060
Think of all the girls you fucked 
without a condom.

1910
01:26:50,720 --> 01:26:54,710
Yeah.
Google first came with living in Boston.

1911
01:26:54,890 --> 01:26:57,260
When you live in Boston,
you don't have time to put a condom on.

1912
01:26:57,890 --> 01:26:59,200
Girls will get angry.
I check.

1913
01:27:04,610 --> 01:27:06,130
Yeah,
just stick it in white.

1914
01:27:06,131 --> 01:27:11,131
You could do your best as quickly as you
could get away from those monsters.

1915
01:27:12,500 --> 01:27:17,500
Did you live in the city?
I lived all over the place.

1916
01:27:18,081 --> 01:27:23,081
I grew up in Newton,
but I lived in revere and in Medford I 

1917
01:27:23,721 --> 01:27:26,150
lived a couple different spots.
I lived off symphony.

1918
01:27:26,480 --> 01:27:27,420
I lived in Lynn.
Right.

1919
01:27:28,270 --> 01:27:30,790
You'd never go out the way he came in 
eight Pi.

1920
01:27:30,820 --> 01:27:33,840
They're really stoned one night.
Oh yeah,

1921
01:27:33,860 --> 01:27:36,620
there was the grossest place ever lived 
like that was on the ocean.

1922
01:27:37,650 --> 01:27:39,020
Ocean was nasty.
It was never.

1923
01:27:39,021 --> 01:27:40,590
It never felt cool to be on the ocean 
air.

1924
01:27:41,640 --> 01:27:43,360
I couldn't appreciate it either.
As you know,

1925
01:27:43,610 --> 01:27:44,420
19 or 20.

1926
01:27:46,150 --> 01:27:49,440
You have.
I thought I had aids once.

1927
01:27:50,020 --> 01:27:51,860
There was this girl that I used to fuck 
around with.

1928
01:27:52,090 --> 01:27:57,090
One of the girls that like only had a 
threesome a couple of times by one of 

1929
01:27:57,090 --> 01:28:00,171
the girls.
It was the girlfriend that she was a 

1930
01:28:00,171 --> 01:28:00,171
hippie.
She used to be a hippie.

1931
01:28:00,171 --> 01:28:00,171
I ran into her and she was like looking 
hot.

1932
01:28:00,171 --> 01:28:01,500
She was unhappy anymore.
She has big boobs,

1933
01:28:01,680 --> 01:28:04,260
so we fucked up a couple times.
She had a boob job.

1934
01:28:04,350 --> 01:28:08,170
She always had good boobs,
but now she was just hot girls,

1935
01:28:08,380 --> 01:28:10,380
hot girl.
And so we fucked around.

1936
01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:10,760
Uh,
we,

1937
01:28:10,920 --> 01:28:15,920
you know,
back in the day they used to have a 

1938
01:28:15,920 --> 01:28:15,920
Webcam and I fucked her on Webcam.
You now,

1939
01:28:15,920 --> 01:28:19,770
thank God no one ever require a 37 and 
then.

1940
01:28:19,771 --> 01:28:22,300
So it was basically only used 12.
Yeah,

1941
01:28:22,660 --> 01:28:24,210
I thought you were younger.
Not like immature.

1942
01:28:24,211 --> 01:28:25,290
I just thought you were right.

1943
01:28:25,980 --> 01:28:26,940
And then,
uh,

1944
01:28:27,090 --> 01:28:32,090
she uh,
didn't live in the city and so she got 

1945
01:28:32,090 --> 01:28:35,211
pregnant and then she came back and I 
had to like sell all this stuff to pay 

1946
01:28:35,211 --> 01:28:37,560
for the baby hammer or whatever.
It's called abortion.

1947
01:28:37,750 --> 01:28:38,480
And so,
uh,

1948
01:28:38,640 --> 01:28:41,220
then I found out from a friend that knew
or there's like,

1949
01:28:41,221 --> 01:28:43,050
dude,
she's been doing heroin lately.

1950
01:28:43,051 --> 01:28:43,400
You know,
she,

1951
01:28:43,430 --> 01:28:48,430
she's,
I guess she's been doing heroin a lot 

1952
01:28:48,430 --> 01:28:48,430
now.
She's just fucked up and I'm thinking,

1953
01:28:48,430 --> 01:28:49,530
oh great,
I fucked a heroin addict,

1954
01:28:49,590 --> 01:28:50,880
you know,
with no condom on,

1955
01:28:51,210 --> 01:28:52,110
you know,
and I'm like thinking.

1956
01:28:52,460 --> 01:28:54,640
And then one day I have no nowhere.
She called me up,

1957
01:28:54,650 --> 01:28:55,230
he goes,
Brian,

1958
01:28:55,740 --> 01:28:57,660
I need to talk to you about something.
And I'm like,

1959
01:28:57,661 --> 01:28:57,960
no,
no,

1960
01:28:57,970 --> 01:28:58,270
no,
no,

1961
01:28:58,980 --> 01:29:00,130
no bad color,
you know,

1962
01:29:00,140 --> 01:29:03,570
I hung up because my girlfriend was in 
bed with me and I was like,

1963
01:29:03,610 --> 01:29:06,420
I can't talk to you.
And for a couple of years I was like,

1964
01:29:06,480 --> 01:29:11,480
what,
what did she want to talk to me about 

1965
01:29:11,480 --> 01:29:11,480
it?

1966
01:29:11,480 --> 01:29:13,740
And then so then I went on Google when 
Google first came out and I'm like,

1967
01:29:13,880 --> 01:29:16,490
uh,
I'm thinking any kind of symptoms I have

1968
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:21,560
noticed I've had.
And one was like sweating at night and 

1969
01:29:21,560 --> 01:29:21,560
I'm like typing,
sweating at night.

1970
01:29:21,560 --> 01:29:21,560
And I was like,
oh,

1971
01:29:21,560 --> 01:29:22,200
aids.
And then I'll be like,

1972
01:29:22,201 --> 01:29:24,570
I want to say that and I got to like 
type in something else,

1973
01:29:24,571 --> 01:29:26,970
you know,
like a headache or something that,

1974
01:29:26,971 --> 01:29:27,550
you know,
aids,

1975
01:29:27,590 --> 01:29:32,590
it kept on going back to AIDS.
So for a couple years I was freaked out 

1976
01:29:32,590 --> 01:29:34,010
and finally I had some kind of a mole 
removed and they,

1977
01:29:34,020 --> 01:29:35,760
they had to do a full blood thing and 
I'm like,

1978
01:29:35,761 --> 01:29:38,880
can you add the aids bonus test to that?
And I was fine,

1979
01:29:38,881 --> 01:29:43,881
but it was such a relief.
And then later I found out that she 

1980
01:29:43,881 --> 01:29:43,881
wanted to tell me that,
uh,

1981
01:29:43,881 --> 01:29:48,560
she didn't ha was pregnant,
she never gotten an abortion and that 

1982
01:29:48,560 --> 01:29:49,590
she just wanted money to buy more 
heroin.

1983
01:29:50,560 --> 01:29:53,790
She had a confessed to you 10 steps.

1984
01:29:53,820 --> 01:29:58,820
Yeah.
That's one of those things while steps 

1985
01:29:58,820 --> 01:29:58,820
whatever it is.
Yeah.

1986
01:29:58,820 --> 01:30:02,421
You have to right the wrongs.
Have you ever dated someone that was an 

1987
01:30:02,421 --> 01:30:03,930
alcoholic?
I went on two dates with a girl wants.

1988
01:30:03,931 --> 01:30:06,090
It was really cool and it turns out to 
be an alcoholic.

1989
01:30:06,330 --> 01:30:08,130
The first day we had a great time.
I was like,

1990
01:30:08,131 --> 01:30:09,570
wow,
this chick is so cool.

1991
01:30:10,840 --> 01:30:12,420
She didn't drink.
I don't think we did.

1992
01:30:12,480 --> 01:30:17,480
No,
we just hung out and I remember talking 

1993
01:30:17,480 --> 01:30:17,480
to her.
I'm like,

1994
01:30:17,480 --> 01:30:18,030
she's so nice.
So normal.

1995
01:30:18,330 --> 01:30:23,330
And then the next night it was a at some
bar in Hollywood where there was going 

1996
01:30:23,330 --> 01:30:26,970
to be a comedy show and she had got 
there before me with her friends and she

1997
01:30:26,971 --> 01:30:31,460
was fucking Amor,
hammered right away,

1998
01:30:31,650 --> 01:30:36,650
hammered and,
and for some reason mad at me and I 

1999
01:30:36,650 --> 01:30:38,460
hadn't done anything.
I had done like nothing.

2000
01:30:38,640 --> 01:30:40,080
I just got there.
I was like,

2001
01:30:40,081 --> 01:30:40,830
what's going on?

2002
01:30:43,890 --> 01:30:45,570
Or something crazy.
I was like,

2003
01:30:45,810 --> 01:30:47,160
why you so drunk?
I go,

2004
01:30:47,161 --> 01:30:48,900
what the fuck happened to you?
And I go,

2005
01:30:48,901 --> 01:30:50,430
where are your friends if someone here 
with you?

2006
01:30:50,460 --> 01:30:53,580
I'm finding myself like she pulls away 
from women.

2007
01:30:53,581 --> 01:30:55,650
Women are.
So this one was,

2008
01:30:56,060 --> 01:30:59,280
was never bought one.
She knocked a glass over and it was like

2009
01:30:59,281 --> 01:31:04,281
the whole deal stumbled,
lost a shoe and get her shoe and put it 

2010
01:31:04,281 --> 01:31:04,281
on.
I was like,

2011
01:31:04,281 --> 01:31:05,850
wow,
I really liked you.

2012
01:31:06,030 --> 01:31:07,170
Like the first date.
I like,

2013
01:31:07,200 --> 01:31:12,200
this girl is cool.
She totally was like girlfriend 

2014
01:31:12,200 --> 01:31:12,200
material.
She was fun.

2015
01:31:12,200 --> 01:31:13,140
She was friendly,
she was nice.

2016
01:31:13,380 --> 01:31:15,000
And then boom,
next night,

2017
01:31:16,680 --> 01:31:21,680
just like to the point of like,
there's no way you ever hang out with 

2018
01:31:21,680 --> 01:31:23,190
someone who gets that drunk go,
oh God.

2019
01:31:23,191 --> 01:31:28,191
Because they don't get personal.
Then she really will be mad about 

2020
01:31:28,191 --> 01:31:30,351
something.
And what's also when you look real 

2021
01:31:30,351 --> 01:31:32,670
alcoholism in the eyes and they're just 
floating around with the rest of us.

2022
01:31:32,700 --> 01:31:36,880
Like most people that I know that drink 
could not drink from now to the,

2023
01:31:36,970 --> 01:31:40,020
like between us,
like Red Duncan,

2024
01:31:40,210 --> 01:31:41,820
Joe,
Joey,

2025
01:31:42,600 --> 01:31:45,420
all of us.
We sat around and we,

2026
01:31:45,421 --> 01:31:50,421
you know,
and we found out that one of us did 

2027
01:31:50,421 --> 01:31:50,640
never drank again.
And that one of us,

2028
01:31:50,641 --> 01:31:51,660
uh,
just uh,

2029
01:31:51,960 --> 01:31:53,670
you know,
one of us just drinks every night now.

2030
01:31:53,720 --> 01:31:58,720
It would be,
I would be more likely to believe that 

2031
01:31:58,720 --> 01:31:58,720
they would just give it up.
Like,

2032
01:31:58,720 --> 01:32:00,310
I don't think any of us would have a 
problem

2033
01:32:00,310 --> 01:32:03,700
giving it up.
I gave it up the other day for four days

2034
01:32:03,701 --> 01:32:06,640
because I got so drunk Thursday for four
days.

2035
01:32:06,930 --> 01:32:08,170
And did you,
did you hear what I did?

2036
01:32:08,171 --> 01:32:10,690
How drunk I got Thursday?
I didn't even tell you this.

2037
01:32:11,200 --> 01:32:12,410
All right.
So I went to,

2038
01:32:12,420 --> 01:32:13,210
that was going to say though,

2039
01:32:13,260 --> 01:32:17,370
but is that before you say this though,
is that that's most of us,

2040
01:32:17,371 --> 01:32:19,980
but we all do know one person who's not.
That way.

2041
01:32:20,250 --> 01:32:25,250
We know one person who you.
You give them a couple of drinks and 

2042
01:32:25,250 --> 01:32:27,310
they're fucking gone.
And I didn't know it existed until I met

2043
01:32:27,540 --> 01:32:29,490
people in Hollywood.
I grew up.

2044
01:32:29,491 --> 01:32:34,491
I didn't know anybody like that.
And you meet people in comedy in 

2045
01:32:34,491 --> 01:32:34,491
particular.
I'm sorry,

2046
01:32:34,491 --> 01:32:38,211
I.
It's true that I remember there's this 

2047
01:32:38,211 --> 01:32:38,820
one booker who is super cool and then he
would just be really mean to me.

2048
01:32:38,870 --> 01:32:43,870
Oh yeah,
the enemies in comedy and I never 

2049
01:32:43,870 --> 01:32:43,870
understood.
I'm like,

2050
01:32:43,870 --> 01:32:44,610
what did I do wrong?
Like why is he mad at me?

2051
01:32:44,780 --> 01:32:47,280
And I found out he was a raging 
alcoholic and if you're not,

2052
01:32:47,490 --> 01:32:50,100
if you're unaware of those types of 
people or how they act,

2053
01:32:50,370 --> 01:32:52,850
you don't know how to handle it.
Because I never knew what it was.

2054
01:32:53,220 --> 01:32:55,750
So bizarre when they literally change 
personalities.

2055
01:32:55,770 --> 01:32:58,290
Do you think it's you?
And not only that,

2056
01:32:58,300 --> 01:33:00,180
you're actually,
you're trapped with a crazy person.

2057
01:33:00,181 --> 01:33:02,610
Like if you ever in a conversation with 
them and they're drunk and you're like,

2058
01:33:02,611 --> 01:33:03,150
Whoa,
whoa,

2059
01:33:03,151 --> 01:33:04,900
well this person doesn't even see 
reality.

2060
01:33:04,901 --> 01:33:06,560
They see reason.
So what was you,

2061
01:33:06,561 --> 01:33:07,050
what were you gonna?
Say

2062
01:33:07,140 --> 01:33:11,810
I got Eddie Bravo drunk the other day.
Indian drunk at St Tropez not,

2063
01:33:12,170 --> 01:33:16,810
you didn't get him drunk.
You got you got as drunk as he gets me.

2064
01:33:16,880 --> 01:33:18,950
Me and Veronica were uh,
going to the show.

2065
01:33:18,990 --> 01:33:21,150
We both hadn't ate all day and we're 
going to eat,

2066
01:33:21,151 --> 01:33:22,290
but we were running late so we were 
like,

2067
01:33:22,291 --> 01:33:27,291
you know what,
we'll just go for a bit and then we'll 

2068
01:33:27,291 --> 01:33:27,291
go get something to eat.
And I guess there was a,

2069
01:33:27,291 --> 01:33:30,150
somebody told me there was was that 
moonshine there and in China and I did a

2070
01:33:30,151 --> 01:33:35,151
couple shots of Moonshine,
but I thought it was just shots of you 

2071
01:33:35,151 --> 01:33:35,151
on the hazard.
And so I,

2072
01:33:35,151 --> 01:33:38,130
I got so fucking drunk that I don't,
I blacked out.

2073
01:33:38,160 --> 01:33:40,130
I completely don't remember.
What is the outcome?

2074
01:33:40,180 --> 01:33:42,900
What's regular proof?
Moonshines hundred proof.

2075
01:33:42,930 --> 01:33:45,500
What is regular alcohol?
Five,

2076
01:33:45,510 --> 01:33:46,740
I think 70.
I don't know.

2077
01:33:47,040 --> 01:33:47,460
I don't know.

2078
01:33:48,350 --> 01:33:49,440
But grain,
grain,

2079
01:33:49,441 --> 01:33:52,140
alcohol.
It's way more powerful than Tequila.

2080
01:33:52,150 --> 01:33:53,910
Right.
And people making themselves.

2081
01:33:53,930 --> 01:33:55,040
Yeah,
hundred percent.

2082
01:33:55,070 --> 01:33:57,810
So how many shots do you think that 
represents at a regular alcoholic?

2083
01:33:57,820 --> 01:33:59,310
I don't know,
but I had.

2084
01:33:59,630 --> 01:34:01,770
They have these alma walkie cans about 
that big.

2085
01:34:01,830 --> 01:34:06,830
I had three of those two shots.
What I thought was just vodka three,

2086
01:34:06,880 --> 01:34:09,150
the old milwaukee giant old milwaukee.
Oh,

2087
01:34:09,151 --> 01:34:11,670
I thought you were saying oh,
milwaukee cans filled with that.

2088
01:34:11,730 --> 01:34:12,060
Oh No,
no,

2089
01:34:12,061 --> 01:34:12,330
no,
no,

2090
01:34:12,340 --> 01:34:13,500
no.
I was like,

2091
01:34:13,590 --> 01:34:14,560
wow,
are you alone?

2092
01:34:14,820 --> 01:34:19,820
And so I,
that night I got home and I was going 

2093
01:34:19,820 --> 01:34:19,950
through my phone and I was remembering 
all the shit that happened,

2094
01:34:19,980 --> 01:34:22,530
train piece things together.
One of the things I did was at the,

2095
01:34:22,560 --> 01:34:25,320
at the show,
somebody was yelling out Veronica's name

2096
01:34:25,321 --> 01:34:27,600
when she was on stage at the nightly 
show and he was like,

2097
01:34:27,601 --> 01:34:30,080
well,
you know,

2098
01:34:30,130 --> 01:34:35,130
like whatever.
So I decided to make fun of them and 

2099
01:34:35,130 --> 01:34:35,130
outdo his heckling.
So I was,

2100
01:34:35,130 --> 01:34:35,790
I have it on tape.
It's on youtube.

2101
01:34:36,030 --> 01:34:39,990
I was going for,
I want to shit on your face,

2102
01:34:40,050 --> 01:34:45,050
but I did it 12 times.
Louder and louder it ever in the eye is 

2103
01:34:45,050 --> 01:34:48,981
looking back like,
what the fuck is this guy wants Ronica 

2104
01:34:48,981 --> 01:34:50,400
so you're not tackling the heckling.

2105
01:34:52,520 --> 01:34:57,520
Why we are so inclined to do the video.
Video is hilarious though.

2106
01:34:58,050 --> 01:34:59,830
If you look at it,
Veronica,

2107
01:34:59,840 --> 01:35:02,270
I want to shit on your face on Youtube.
Oh my God.

2108
01:35:02,271 --> 01:35:07,271
So then I felt videos available on 
youtube right now and so I felt so bad 

2109
01:35:07,271 --> 01:35:08,120
that.
Anyways,

2110
01:35:08,420 --> 01:35:13,420
then that night I went to across the 
street to that where we always ate the 

2111
01:35:13,420 --> 01:35:14,690
standard when you stole his commentary 
and we went in and there was not.

2112
01:35:14,720 --> 01:35:19,720
There was only one other table in the 
whole entire restaurant so me and my 

2113
01:35:19,720 --> 01:35:22,091
girl were eating there and the other 
table was a drunk Japanese guy at big 

2114
01:35:22,091 --> 01:35:26,111
tall black guy in an Armenian and they 
were about 50 to 55 years old and they 

2115
01:35:26,111 --> 01:35:30,141
were wasted just being slobbery wasting 
and the Armenian dude staring at my 

2116
01:35:30,321 --> 01:35:33,050
girlfriend the whole entire time and 
like to the point where I'm like,

2117
01:35:33,051 --> 01:35:34,640
why is this guy staring at you?

2118
01:35:34,880 --> 01:35:36,880
So when we eat I go,
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

2119
01:35:36,890 --> 01:35:38,190
Then we'll leave,
so I go to the bathroom,

2120
01:35:38,191 --> 01:35:41,090
I come back and he got,
he was in the middle of this table.

2121
01:35:41,091 --> 01:35:43,270
He got out of the table.
He was leaning on the table,

2122
01:35:43,610 --> 01:35:46,550
freaking my girlfriend at like trying to
hit on or doing something.

2123
01:35:46,730 --> 01:35:49,220
He knew I was with her.
He saw the whole time I was there.

2124
01:35:49,580 --> 01:35:51,470
So I walk up to this and I'm like,
okay,

2125
01:35:51,710 --> 01:35:56,710
I'm wasted black out wasted.
I'm going to act like a fucking psycho 

2126
01:35:56,710 --> 01:35:56,980
and this is how dumb I was.
I said,

2127
01:35:56,981 --> 01:35:58,490
go ahead.
What's up man?

2128
01:35:59,120 --> 01:36:00,640
How's it going?
Like I like,

2129
01:36:00,680 --> 01:36:02,810
I was on cocaine or like I was just 
like,

2130
01:36:02,811 --> 01:36:07,811
I'm going to say what are you doing 
that's like get the fuck out of here 

2131
01:36:07,811 --> 01:36:07,811
man.
And he's like,

2132
01:36:07,811 --> 01:36:07,811
Oh,
I'm so sorry.

2133
01:36:07,811 --> 01:36:08,000
I'm so sorry.
I don't think.

2134
01:36:08,090 --> 01:36:10,600
Don't make me fucking shoot you man.
Like I said,

2135
01:36:10,610 --> 01:36:13,760
don't make me.
It got to the point where the standard,

2136
01:36:13,761 --> 01:36:15,930
the security comes up and goes,
do we have a problem here?

2137
01:36:15,931 --> 01:36:16,670
I'm like,
no man.

2138
01:36:16,850 --> 01:36:17,360
And he's like,
Hey,

2139
01:36:17,480 --> 01:36:19,370
here's your bill.
Knight tip them 100 percent.

2140
01:36:19,371 --> 01:36:22,060
It was like $43.
I tip them like $40,

2141
01:36:22,061 --> 01:36:23,430
$30,
$40,

2142
01:36:24,270 --> 01:36:25,310
you know,
because I was like,

2143
01:36:25,311 --> 01:36:26,690
why?
I was acting crazy.

2144
01:36:26,691 --> 01:36:29,060
I was just like a security,
here's,

2145
01:36:29,061 --> 01:36:32,510
here's a 100 percent.
And then like I'll come out and you hear

2146
01:36:32,511 --> 01:36:34,430
the guy sit down and he's like,
he,

2147
01:36:34,790 --> 01:36:35,720
he's,
he's right on.

2148
01:36:36,280 --> 01:36:37,330
I don't know why I did that,
you know,

2149
01:36:37,340 --> 01:36:42,340
like I could hear him saying that and I 
go have a safe trip outside asshole or 

2150
01:36:43,341 --> 01:36:45,320
something like that.
And then the guy's like,

2151
01:36:45,560 --> 01:36:46,970
man,
stop moving,

2152
01:36:46,971 --> 01:36:51,971
stop.
And I just walk out and I'm walking out 

2153
01:36:51,971 --> 01:36:51,971
and I'm like,
Holy Shit,

2154
01:36:51,971 --> 01:36:51,971
this,
get the fuck out,

2155
01:36:52,100 --> 01:36:54,470
but I could have easily poker.

2156
01:36:54,480 --> 01:36:57,170
You play play bloke.
And I bluffed in a,

2157
01:36:57,180 --> 01:37:02,180
it works.
And the funny thing is before I went to 

2158
01:37:02,180 --> 01:37:02,180
a,
before I did this,

2159
01:37:02,220 --> 01:37:02,990
uh,
I was like,

2160
01:37:02,991 --> 01:37:04,730
Hey,
let's do a podcast while we're eating,

2161
01:37:04,731 --> 01:37:05,140
you know,
to,

2162
01:37:05,210 --> 01:37:06,190
to Veronica.
And,

2163
01:37:06,440 --> 01:37:09,230
and I forgot that the waiter came up or 
something like that.

2164
01:37:09,231 --> 01:37:11,180
And so my,
I recorded the whole thing,

2165
01:37:12,100 --> 01:37:15,690
the old version of it.
But I am so embarrassed by I,

2166
01:37:15,700 --> 01:37:18,680
I do not want to release it.
I listened to it.

2167
01:37:19,520 --> 01:37:21,930
I don't even know now I,
I don't want anyone else.

2168
01:37:22,570 --> 01:37:23,210
Brian.
Brian,

2169
01:37:23,211 --> 01:37:24,940
this is a beautiful thing.
No,

2170
01:37:24,941 --> 01:37:25,260
no,
no,

2171
01:37:25,350 --> 01:37:30,350
no.
It's so embarrassing thing ever 

2172
01:37:30,680 --> 01:37:33,020
documented everything.
You already admitted to it,

2173
01:37:33,021 --> 01:37:35,950
but you already admitted to it.
I know that,

2174
01:37:36,110 --> 01:37:38,510
that just,
that thing alone was like,

2175
01:37:38,511 --> 01:37:40,130
listen bro,
you're like a little slot right now.

2176
01:37:40,131 --> 01:37:41,150
You're using on the world.

2177
01:37:41,150 --> 01:37:43,490
I,
I might release in the release it.

2178
01:37:43,540 --> 01:37:44,320
I don't think.
Come on.

2179
01:37:44,330 --> 01:37:45,590
You already brought it up.
You already,

2180
01:37:45,591 --> 01:37:46,920
you already.
So embarrassing.

2181
01:37:46,940 --> 01:37:51,940
You mentioned it's so you've got to 
release it to embarrassing.

2182
01:37:51,951 --> 01:37:56,951
It's not,
you're crazy acting like a fucking 

2183
01:37:56,951 --> 01:37:56,951
psycho.
Well listen,

2184
01:37:56,951 --> 01:37:56,951
you were,
you felt threatened.

2185
01:37:56,951 --> 01:37:58,230
There was a bunch of men,
you know.

2186
01:37:58,740 --> 01:38:01,380
And see what,
what's so funny is that she did the same

2187
01:38:01,381 --> 01:38:06,381
thing on yours.
I think I talked about like where we're 

2188
01:38:06,381 --> 01:38:08,480
getting threat.
We went party downtown and it was one 

2189
01:38:08,480 --> 01:38:09,900
street from the shelter and we were 
drunk at like 2:00

2190
01:38:09,900 --> 01:38:10,170
AM.
Walk,

2191
01:38:10,171 --> 01:38:11,850
walking to our car.
Uh,

2192
01:38:11,851 --> 01:38:15,150
and with a friend that wasn't drunk that
was driving us and uh,

2193
01:38:15,151 --> 01:38:15,610
the,
the,

2194
01:38:15,830 --> 01:38:20,830
we are going through what was like the 
homeless were all the shelters are and 

2195
01:38:20,830 --> 01:38:25,581
stuff like that.
So the street was just all homeless 

2196
01:38:25,581 --> 01:38:25,581
people,
about 100 of them in one block,

2197
01:38:25,581 --> 01:38:30,110
you know,
just like zombies walking around in our 

2198
01:38:30,110 --> 01:38:30,340
car was in the middle of it and then 
like all these people kept on coming up.

2199
01:38:30,340 --> 01:38:31,710
But Hey,
drunk thriller.

2200
01:38:31,711 --> 01:38:32,470
Yeah,
it was like through,

2201
01:38:32,520 --> 01:38:34,360
it was exactly correct.
Yeah.

2202
01:38:34,500 --> 01:38:35,880
And so like this one,
all these people,

2203
01:38:36,020 --> 01:38:36,950
my girlfriend's high,
you know,

2204
01:38:36,960 --> 01:38:39,710
dressed up new year's eve style,
like buttholes showing out and,

2205
01:38:40,430 --> 01:38:45,430
and it was interesting,
the whole girl ain't even fashionable.

2206
01:38:47,190 --> 01:38:52,190
Yeah.
And so like all these people kept on 

2207
01:38:52,190 --> 01:38:52,190
coming up for money and stuff and her 
response,

2208
01:38:52,190 --> 01:38:56,720
like her defense mechanism,
it's just going like,

2209
01:38:57,680 --> 01:38:58,830
just like.
And people are like,

2210
01:38:58,831 --> 01:39:00,120
damn that girl and crack,
you know,

2211
01:39:00,121 --> 01:39:05,121
like that.
So I think I did the same thing and I 

2212
01:39:05,121 --> 01:39:07,720
was so wasted.
I don't know if you remember that she 

2213
01:39:07,720 --> 01:39:09,291
had done that.
That comes from a weird place to be 

2214
01:39:09,291 --> 01:39:09,291
like,
I'm going to act a crazy person.

2215
01:39:09,990 --> 01:39:12,630
I don't think I could do that or think 
it's just too much confidence.

2216
01:39:12,660 --> 01:39:13,950
Liquid confidence,
you know,

2217
01:39:13,980 --> 01:39:14,660
like I'm just gonna.

2218
01:39:14,700 --> 01:39:16,440
Well you sounded like you were in 
another world,

2219
01:39:16,470 --> 01:39:17,790
man.
It sounds like you were so drunk.

2220
01:39:17,791 --> 01:39:19,860
You don't know what the fuck your 
butthole out.

2221
01:39:20,550 --> 01:39:23,710
That's normal.
It's a cigarette butt hanging out.

2222
01:39:24,080 --> 01:39:27,690
It's Halloween and if there's ever a 
time the butthole was,

2223
01:39:27,760 --> 01:39:28,950
we'll,
we'll launch.

2224
01:39:29,590 --> 01:39:34,590
We'll launch blossom.
The butthole blossom picture by the way 

2225
01:39:35,640 --> 01:39:36,410
of what?
He's like,

2226
01:39:36,470 --> 01:39:37,950
can you do Joe's podcasts?
And I was like,

2227
01:39:37,951 --> 01:39:39,420
let me check,
let me see what I'm doing.

2228
01:39:39,690 --> 01:39:40,740
He was like,
it's a 4:00

2229
01:39:40,740 --> 01:39:45,740
PM and then I click on my text and 
there's just a picture of a dog with a 

2230
01:39:45,740 --> 01:39:45,740
cork in it.
Oh yeah.

2231
01:39:47,510 --> 01:39:48,700
I just wrote back,
I was like,

2232
01:39:50,340 --> 01:39:51,870
oh yeah,
we can't poop.

2233
01:39:51,900 --> 01:39:55,200
I'm like,
don't send me stuff like that.

2234
01:39:56,550 --> 01:40:01,550
That's such a weird for me to be like.
And now here's Joe was address the time 

2235
01:40:01,650 --> 01:40:03,780
and don were the corporate as well.
I've gotten,

2236
01:40:03,830 --> 01:40:04,950
I could not like it.
You know,

2237
01:40:04,951 --> 01:40:06,210
I,
that's not real,

2238
01:40:06,211 --> 01:40:10,890
it's a photoshop,
but I liked it but I love sending random

2239
01:40:10,891 --> 01:40:14,250
photos and like I was homesick or if he 
has a,

2240
01:40:14,280 --> 01:40:16,770
he's busy Friday and he's like,
I'm in Minneapolis,

2241
01:40:16,771 --> 01:40:19,860
so I sent him a picture of a big black 
guy with his dick out and he goes,

2242
01:40:19,861 --> 01:40:24,861
that's unnecessary.
Like you done this to me many times.

2243
01:40:26,190 --> 01:40:31,190
I think we've all seen enough disgusting
crap like just from him sending a text 

2244
01:40:32,161 --> 01:40:35,940
message and it's an image you can't see 
what it is.

2245
01:40:35,941 --> 01:40:37,800
Like it's at nighttime at a comedy club 
or something like that.

2246
01:40:37,980 --> 01:40:42,980
I clicked on the image and it's a black 
guy with a giant Dick and a white guy 

2247
01:40:42,980 --> 01:40:46,731
sucking.
It was funny when it's a black guy's 

2248
01:40:46,731 --> 01:40:46,731
penis funnier,
no jail.

2249
01:40:46,731 --> 01:40:51,280
This last weekend it was my girlfriend's
birthday and she was turning 30 and I 

2250
01:40:51,280 --> 01:40:52,210
was like,
I'm going to be a material center.

2251
01:40:52,250 --> 01:40:54,370
Neurotic cake.
And what they do

2252
01:40:54,400 --> 01:40:59,400
when you call for the erotic cake is 
they take you through the entire order 

2253
01:40:59,400 --> 01:40:59,680
process and at the end tell you how much
it is.

2254
01:40:59,840 --> 01:41:01,810
And it was like $200.
And we're like,

2255
01:41:01,870 --> 01:41:06,870
not even close I guess was a regular 
tank.

2256
01:41:07,120 --> 01:41:12,120
You have to pay more for the buck.
Like it depends on how much like at the 

2257
01:41:12,120 --> 01:41:14,581
grocery store,
$100 to make a dick can have it 

2258
01:41:14,581 --> 01:41:16,921
delivered to.
But it was like in Houston it was so 

2259
01:41:16,921 --> 01:41:20,161
uncomfortable because I'm already 
calling them like it's like a big and I 

2260
01:41:20,161 --> 01:41:21,340
had to get a black penis because it's 
funnier for some peanuts on the cake.

2261
01:41:21,580 --> 01:41:22,250
And then he was like,
alright.

2262
01:41:22,360 --> 01:41:24,280
And he was so over his job.
He's like,

2263
01:41:24,281 --> 01:41:26,200
you won't come.
You want hair on the balls.

2264
01:41:26,201 --> 01:41:27,610
I was like,
I literally was like,

2265
01:41:27,611 --> 01:41:28,930
please don't ask me that.
It's uncomfortable.

2266
01:41:28,931 --> 01:41:31,210
He's like,
what I do is what I do.

2267
01:41:31,550 --> 01:41:34,840
So for 200 bucks you got a black penis.
And I had them write and have an elegant

2268
01:41:34,841 --> 01:41:38,320
birthday.
I didn't want to be like,

2269
01:41:38,380 --> 01:41:42,090
so could you dirties?
So I wrote something nice.

2270
01:41:43,450 --> 01:41:47,830
If you're actually,
why would you not want to say that?

2271
01:41:48,010 --> 01:41:52,930
I wanted it to retain some.
Saved that dignity for the tourists.

2272
01:41:53,240 --> 01:41:53,990
Thirties.
Yeah.

2273
01:41:53,991 --> 01:41:58,991
You started.
I used to always get boob cakes from my 

2274
01:41:58,991 --> 01:41:58,991
family growing up from like 12 on or 
something like that.

2275
01:41:58,991 --> 01:42:01,000
From them,
from them or for them from them,

2276
01:42:01,001 --> 01:42:06,001
like every day.
That was like the big thing that my dad 

2277
01:42:06,001 --> 01:42:07,210
was 12 or 13 and they were actual 
nipples.

2278
01:42:07,680 --> 01:42:12,680
Well they weren't real enablers.
They were made out of Hershey kisses 

2279
01:42:12,680 --> 01:42:16,730
Hershey's,
but it would look like two white 

2280
01:42:16,730 --> 01:42:16,730
nipples.
It's called quip.

2281
01:42:16,730 --> 01:42:17,860
So.
But it would look like that.

2282
01:42:18,140 --> 01:42:19,080
It would look like,
whoops.

2283
01:42:19,200 --> 01:42:19,990
It's fine,
you know,

2284
01:42:19,991 --> 01:42:21,590
like I don't think there was,
you know,

2285
01:42:21,670 --> 01:42:26,670
I,
I think I feel like there was like gyms 

2286
01:42:26,670 --> 01:42:26,670
and the batter or something.

2287
01:42:26,670 --> 01:42:26,670
I take that back.
It wasn't full boob.

2288
01:42:26,670 --> 01:42:31,651
It was the one where the bikini,
but you could see a little boob like in 

2289
01:42:31,651 --> 01:42:35,241
it a cakes,
but the older I got I started having 

2290
01:42:35,241 --> 01:42:35,350
nipples but my 18th birthday,
but the older I got,

2291
01:42:35,420 --> 01:42:40,420
I started moving up,
but when I was 18 with and boy would 

2292
01:42:40,420 --> 01:42:43,130
have changed the cake when I was 18,
I was a black one.

2293
01:42:43,460 --> 01:42:45,370
You think you ever molested that?
You don't remember.

2294
01:42:45,490 --> 01:42:47,330
It's possible.
I hope not.

2295
01:42:47,650 --> 01:42:48,790
I hope.
Do you think something,

2296
01:42:48,830 --> 01:42:51,370
something must've happened though right 
when you were younger that you're trying

2297
01:42:51,371 --> 01:42:55,180
to block out bouquets growing up.
That is weird.

2298
01:42:55,300 --> 01:43:00,300
Why was it cleveland cakes and then I 
think when I was 16 it started becoming 

2299
01:43:03,401 --> 01:43:08,401
big cakes and almost 18 was black.
They had open vaginas,

2300
01:43:08,771 --> 01:43:12,010
vaginas with like who is like,
let me slice into this.

2301
01:43:12,010 --> 01:43:15,530
This looks great.
The midwest boom cakes were I guess more

2302
01:43:15,550 --> 01:43:16,770
accepted.
I don't know.

2303
01:43:17,110 --> 01:43:19,770
Social well there wasn't a lot to do 
that.

2304
01:43:19,771 --> 01:43:22,030
Right.
I think just anything,

2305
01:43:22,031 --> 01:43:22,720
it seems like,
you know,

2306
01:43:22,721 --> 01:43:26,350
people that lived in West Virginia and 
where you're from or where in Ohio,

2307
01:43:26,380 --> 01:43:26,980
Columbus,
Ohio,

2308
01:43:27,220 --> 01:43:29,200
but I think that whole little chunk of 
area,

2309
01:43:29,201 --> 01:43:32,500
I think people were had to look like a 
sick sense of humor in Texas.

2310
01:43:32,720 --> 01:43:34,270
You remember?
I remember her sense of humor.

2311
01:43:34,390 --> 01:43:39,390
Like I remember like you'd go to,
you'd go to these people's houses and 

2312
01:43:39,390 --> 01:43:43,111
they would have like little statues that
were silly and there was a penis 

2313
01:43:43,111 --> 01:43:43,420
involved.
Do you know,

2314
01:43:43,421 --> 01:43:45,250
like.
And that was at your grandma's house.

2315
01:43:45,251 --> 01:43:50,251
You know,
what's your grandpa's elephants on 

2316
01:43:50,251 --> 01:43:52,010
there?
You lived in a sad world,

2317
01:43:53,550 --> 01:43:58,170
then you go cut wood country.
I don't know.

2318
01:43:59,410 --> 01:44:02,050
I grew up in a Stephen King Movie Kid.
Yeah,

2319
01:44:02,080 --> 01:44:03,710
it did.
It was a Stephen King.

2320
01:44:04,060 --> 01:44:09,060
That's what it is.
It's just like people were just not 

2321
01:44:09,060 --> 01:44:12,570
happy.
Had more humor for humor or sexually 

2322
01:44:12,570 --> 01:44:13,260
sexual humor.
They're more just perfect.

2323
01:44:13,261 --> 01:44:18,261
Well,
it sounds like your friends in 

2324
01:44:18,261 --> 01:44:18,261
neighborhoods,
families.

2325
01:44:18,261 --> 01:44:20,300
I'm talking within the dirty comedians 
you're hanging out with here.

2326
01:44:20,330 --> 01:44:22,740
Like what are you to.
I'm just saying that they were like,

2327
01:44:22,741 --> 01:44:27,741
oh,
I grew up feeling like everyone had a 

2328
01:44:27,741 --> 01:44:31,510
dirty joke thing.
Like everyone's families had like dirty 

2329
01:44:31,510 --> 01:44:34,781
magazines and everyone's like,
if you find the dad's got like some 

2330
01:44:34,781 --> 01:44:38,651
playboys and like one or two things,
but not like on the mantle boot cakes.

2331
01:44:38,781 --> 01:44:41,250
I think we're more accepted.
I mean,

2332
01:44:41,300 --> 01:44:46,300
I think that was normal for a lot of 
people that get a boob cleavage cake 

2333
01:44:46,300 --> 01:44:46,300
when you're 16.

2334
01:44:46,300 --> 01:44:46,700
Really?
Yeah,

2335
01:44:46,940 --> 01:44:48,230
absolutely.
I believe you.

2336
01:44:48,920 --> 01:44:50,900
I believe you.
It just seems weird to me.

2337
01:44:51,400 --> 01:44:53,210
Yeah.
Your mom have to order it now.

2338
01:44:53,240 --> 01:44:56,280
My mom would never give me a boot.
She should give me Jesus.

2339
01:44:56,350 --> 01:44:58,220
You ever have one of your friends,
um,

2340
01:44:58,310 --> 01:44:59,080
who had,
uh,

2341
01:44:59,120 --> 01:45:02,480
like a buddy of his friend's mom now 
just know anybody to do that.

2342
01:45:03,330 --> 01:45:04,580
Yeah.
Yeah.

2343
01:45:04,581 --> 01:45:09,581
I knew.
I knew one kid can only see your eyes 

2344
01:45:09,581 --> 01:45:09,581
right now.
I remember one kid who,

2345
01:45:09,581 --> 01:45:11,250
uh,
fucked his friend's mom is friends while

2346
01:45:11,251 --> 01:45:16,251
I was kind of a freak and I think they 
smoked weed together to bang his 

2347
01:45:16,701 --> 01:45:18,650
friend's mom.
She was a single mom.

2348
01:45:20,800 --> 01:45:23,990
I was like 16 or 17 and I think he was a
year older than us.

2349
01:45:24,170 --> 01:45:29,170
He made it been 18.
It might've been like a year out of 

2350
01:45:29,170 --> 01:45:31,571
school and we were sophomores mean 
buying the student's mom for the kid 

2351
01:45:32,970 --> 01:45:35,490
whose mom?
Yeah.

2352
01:45:35,540 --> 01:45:37,340
Nobody was happy.
Yeah.

2353
01:45:37,341 --> 01:45:39,760
Dudes don't like that.
I remember when that.

2354
01:45:40,700 --> 01:45:42,530
Yeah.
When I was in the boy scouts,

2355
01:45:42,620 --> 01:45:46,080
one of the fucking 18 year old kids was 
hitting on my mom in front of me.

2356
01:45:46,081 --> 01:45:50,210
And it was for the guys who just got out
of the.

2357
01:45:50,500 --> 01:45:54,000
He's flirting with my mom about the time
my mom was in her thirties.

2358
01:45:54,010 --> 01:45:56,390
She was still pretty hot.
That's crazy.

2359
01:45:56,870 --> 01:45:58,790
It was gross though,
being a little kid going,

2360
01:45:58,791 --> 01:46:00,770
what the fuck?
Just thinking,

2361
01:46:00,970 --> 01:46:02,840
dude,
what's up with your mom?

2362
01:46:02,930 --> 01:46:07,930
I would imagine that's awful.
I'd never thought about anyone voting 

2363
01:46:07,930 --> 01:46:08,480
that's probably going to go through your
head one day.

2364
01:46:08,830 --> 01:46:13,830
You're going to have to tell some little
18 year old kid to get the fuck away 

2365
01:46:13,830 --> 01:46:13,830
from you.
You're taking your kid to school.

2366
01:46:13,830 --> 01:46:14,520
I do.
Now it's having to take.

2367
01:46:15,410 --> 01:46:18,710
Do you do now?
Do you ever want to like teach them?

2368
01:46:18,740 --> 01:46:19,720
Show them what's up?
No,

2369
01:46:20,360 --> 01:46:22,160
no.
Grab a boy by the hair.

2370
01:46:22,220 --> 01:46:25,550
Come here and try to find a good one.
I can't.

2371
01:46:25,580 --> 01:46:30,580
I really don't have a thing for guys 
that are younger than me at all and so I

2372
01:46:30,810 --> 01:46:35,810
just get very.
There's a PA that works on our show who 

2373
01:46:35,810 --> 01:46:37,280
is adorable and so cute and I'm so 
attracted to him,

2374
01:46:37,281 --> 01:46:39,680
but not in the way that I want to make 
out with him,

2375
01:46:39,681 --> 01:46:44,681
but I know it's hot every time.
His name is Joey and every time I see 

2376
01:46:44,681 --> 01:46:45,600
him I'm like,
no,

2377
01:46:47,640 --> 01:46:49,200
he's so hot,
but I.

2378
01:46:49,200 --> 01:46:50,640
There's nothing.
I don't want to sleep with him.

2379
01:46:50,640 --> 01:46:54,200
I just want to like hug him.
I have no sexual attraction.

2380
01:46:54,240 --> 01:46:56,100
I can tell someone's hot,
but I have no sexual attraction.

2381
01:46:56,101 --> 01:46:58,860
Anyone younger than me because it makes 
me feel so old.

2382
01:46:59,350 --> 01:47:02,790
I don't like feeling old in my twenties.
That makes sense.

2383
01:47:02,820 --> 01:47:03,840
Yeah.
It's not attractive.

2384
01:47:03,841 --> 01:47:07,590
I don't know.
And then everything starts to hurt.

2385
01:47:07,830 --> 01:47:11,060
I feel so old as it is because you're 
very smart for 28,

2386
01:47:11,560 --> 01:47:16,560
you know?
That's the problem is that a problem 

2387
01:47:16,560 --> 01:47:16,560
must be a problem with dealing with 
dudes.

2388
01:47:16,560 --> 01:47:17,510
The most guys in their twenties or even 
dumber than girls,

2389
01:47:17,520 --> 01:47:22,520
their twenties because of testosterone.
Testosterone fucking clouds your mind 

2390
01:47:22,520 --> 01:47:26,421
and really massively slows down your 
ability to accumulate information 

2391
01:47:26,421 --> 01:47:26,680
because there's just so busy chasing 
posted.

2392
01:47:27,120 --> 01:47:28,620
Especially when you're in your early 
twenties.

2393
01:47:28,770 --> 01:47:31,800
He barely learn a God damn thing until 
you're like almost 30.

2394
01:47:31,930 --> 01:47:34,590
You're a dude.
Get the feeling that a lot of guys,

2395
01:47:35,330 --> 01:47:38,820
anybody that knows me obviously isn't 
hitting on me like they know me,

2396
01:47:38,970 --> 01:47:39,420
but I get.

2397
01:47:39,580 --> 01:47:43,530
I get this vibe.
That was totally one of the gang,

2398
01:47:44,370 --> 01:47:49,370
but I get this feeling that comics who I
know just from seeing around different 

2399
01:47:49,370 --> 01:47:53,571
clubs or whatever,
that they're a little afraid of me and 

2400
01:47:53,571 --> 01:47:53,730
it's not because I want to like hurt 
anyone's feelings,

2401
01:47:53,731 --> 01:47:55,500
but if you come up to me,
you say something stupid,

2402
01:47:55,800 --> 01:47:57,780
I'm not going to be like the money.
I'm going to be like,

2403
01:47:57,830 --> 01:47:59,550
what?
And then they get nervous,

2404
01:48:00,280 --> 01:48:04,070
but I don't mean to act like a person if
you're going to come talk to.

2405
01:48:04,110 --> 01:48:09,110
Some men are just fucked up talking to 
women and some men are so insecure when 

2406
01:48:09,110 --> 01:48:13,371
it comes to talking to women that they,
they fall apart and so quickly 

2407
01:48:13,371 --> 01:48:13,920
translates to hate.
But you know what it is.

2408
01:48:14,340 --> 01:48:18,510
I realized that when I had a friend who 
was an ugly dude who broke it down to me

2409
01:48:18,511 --> 01:48:20,340
once where he's talking about girls and 
you know,

2410
01:48:20,341 --> 01:48:23,400
I was trying to tell them from a girl's 
perspective and I'm like,

2411
01:48:23,401 --> 01:48:28,401
just imagine if you're a girl and a guy 
like you is constantly trying to fuck 

2412
01:48:28,401 --> 01:48:28,401
her.

2413
01:48:28,401 --> 01:48:28,410
Yeah.
You know,

2414
01:48:28,411 --> 01:48:30,570
I mean in any said,
well here's the deal.

2415
01:48:30,571 --> 01:48:31,950
He goes,
I have to admit,

2416
01:48:31,951 --> 01:48:33,150
he goes,
I'm not good looking.

2417
01:48:33,510 --> 01:48:38,510
He goes,
it's just I'm not so they don't not 

2418
01:48:38,510 --> 01:48:39,951
attracted to me,
so I have to try harder and forced 

2419
01:48:39,951 --> 01:48:40,770
myself in say yes,
yes,

2420
01:48:40,800 --> 01:48:45,800
someone will give in.
Someone will just be overwhelmed by his 

2421
01:48:45,800 --> 01:48:46,260
confidence,
but at the end of the day they get angry

2422
01:48:46,261 --> 01:48:49,000
at you and for a lot of these men it's 
becomes.

2423
01:48:49,160 --> 01:48:54,160
They just have this direct association 
in their head with women with feeling 

2424
01:48:54,160 --> 01:48:58,401
bad,
feeling rejected and they just want to 

2425
01:48:58,401 --> 01:48:59,730
strike out and that's where a lot of 
them that anger towards women comes from

2426
01:48:59,780 --> 01:49:03,870
like my twitter feed or my facebook 
grown men and this is the weirdest thing

2427
01:49:03,871 --> 01:49:05,580
to me.
I understand guys can be gross.

2428
01:49:05,610 --> 01:49:09,100
I don't fault anyone for you know you.
Oh fuck you.

2429
01:49:09,140 --> 01:49:09,460
All right.

2430
01:49:09,540 --> 01:49:13,710
That's what people say.
When I go on my facebook page and you've

2431
01:49:13,711 --> 01:49:15,960
written something like,
want to fuck you so hard,

2432
01:49:15,961 --> 01:49:17,200
I come to Christ.
I'm like that.

2433
01:49:17,370 --> 01:49:20,430
And your facebook picture is of you and 
your wife.

2434
01:49:20,730 --> 01:49:22,350
Like,
what the fuck is wrong with you?

2435
01:49:22,351 --> 01:49:26,490
Like you just had such an uncontrollable
boner that you had to ejaculate words on

2436
01:49:26,491 --> 01:49:30,060
my page and it just,
it's not flattering and it's or people,

2437
01:49:30,061 --> 01:49:31,050
right?
Like really mean,

2438
01:49:31,051 --> 01:49:36,051
like I've been on podcasts before and 
even probably today and people will be 

2439
01:49:36,051 --> 01:49:39,531
like such a fucking color door folk.
You're aggressive and you're like,

2440
01:49:39,841 --> 01:49:44,841
why?
Because I spoke like men get amped for 

2441
01:49:44,841 --> 01:49:47,380
stuff like that.
I'm going to check my twitter feed right

2442
01:49:47,381 --> 01:49:47,680
now.

2443
01:49:48,670 --> 01:49:53,670
How you're really going to open it up to
date,

2444
01:49:54,160 --> 01:49:59,160
a woman scorned.
It's like the word I think a guy scored 

2445
01:49:59,160 --> 01:50:01,520
and it's probably worse because they get
rapey raping a lot of men,

2446
01:50:01,840 --> 01:50:06,840
especially dudes who don't do well.
They do associate women with being the 

2447
01:50:06,840 --> 01:50:06,840
source of their misery.
You know?

2448
01:50:06,840 --> 01:50:10,420
It's unfortunate and you know why?
Because prostitution is illegal.

2449
01:50:10,780 --> 01:50:12,880
That's why because of prostitution.
Well,

2450
01:50:12,881 --> 01:50:17,881
legal,
there'll be brothels and someone can 

2451
01:50:17,881 --> 01:50:17,881
take care of those guys.
Physical needs.

2452
01:50:17,881 --> 01:50:18,490
I'm not saying that women should be 
prostitutes,

2453
01:50:18,610 --> 01:50:22,420
but I am saying there's some women who 
are going to be prostitutes and it's not

2454
01:50:22,421 --> 01:50:24,400
a bad thing necessarily.
It ain't a bad thing.

2455
01:50:24,401 --> 01:50:27,550
It's a service to the community.
It's our idea that's bad one.

2456
01:50:27,670 --> 01:50:30,640
So okay to massage a guy,
but it's not okay to massage his dick.

2457
01:50:30,850 --> 01:50:34,210
I say bullshit.
I think it should be legal or illegal.

2458
01:50:34,300 --> 01:50:36,480
Totally illegal.
Should be regulated.

2459
01:50:36,490 --> 01:50:38,170
The girls should be checked.
They should do it.

2460
01:50:38,171 --> 01:50:39,910
Like the handle it in other countries.
You know,

2461
01:50:40,180 --> 01:50:41,530
we're so because we're.
So.

2462
01:50:41,650 --> 01:50:44,470
I think we've talked about this.
It's ridiculous.

2463
01:50:44,890 --> 01:50:47,020
By the way,
grain alcohol is actually 100.

2464
01:50:47,021 --> 01:50:52,021
Someone wrote Brian d dot Morton wrote 
it's 180 to 200 proof and Jack is damn 

2465
01:50:52,450 --> 01:50:52,670
it.

2466
01:50:54,940 --> 01:50:55,810
Oh,
that hurts.

2467
01:50:55,811 --> 01:50:59,110
My liver just is five percent to to just
talk.

2468
01:50:59,380 --> 01:51:02,470
You just said 200 proof.
Just stop and think about that.

2469
01:51:04,100 --> 01:51:06,330
I don't know how to comprehend that.
I never sent out God.

2470
01:51:06,730 --> 01:51:10,210
It's 100 percent of $43 in tip.
Oh my God.

2471
01:51:10,240 --> 01:51:15,020
What a fucking explosion in your liver.
That must be your whole bloodstream.

2472
01:51:15,040 --> 01:51:17,440
Must be like,
what the fuck did you just do?

2473
01:51:18,790 --> 01:51:20,770
Need to get a blood transfusion.
Just add some more.

2474
01:51:20,771 --> 01:51:22,030
You know,
proof is 50 percent,

2475
01:51:22,031 --> 01:51:24,340
moonshine is 100 percent.
So that's what someone said.

2476
01:51:24,341 --> 01:51:24,930
So Moon,
Chinese,

2477
01:51:24,940 --> 01:51:26,740
100 percent.
I'm just reading a tweet.

2478
01:51:27,340 --> 01:51:29,560
Wow.
Yeah.

2479
01:51:29,561 --> 01:51:34,561
I've heard of some ridiculous.
A high percentages of disgusting 

2480
01:51:34,561 --> 01:51:35,980
alcohols,
but that's the highest I've ever heard.

2481
01:51:35,981 --> 01:51:37,510
I've never heard anything about it 
before.

2482
01:51:37,920 --> 01:51:42,920
Yeah.
I drank a shit ton of absinthe once is 

2483
01:51:42,920 --> 01:51:42,920
200 proof.
One hundred percent.

2484
01:51:42,920 --> 01:51:43,510
Is that what it means?
What does it,

2485
01:51:43,511 --> 01:51:43,960
what does it mean?

2486
01:51:43,970 --> 01:51:45,780
I think 200.
I think it's always 50 percent.

2487
01:51:45,870 --> 01:51:47,020
One hundred percent.
Yeah.

2488
01:51:47,021 --> 01:51:51,430
How could you be this map?
Work isn't an fund to be a comedian.

2489
01:51:51,431 --> 01:51:55,170
It'd be fucking ignorant.
Fucking never added things.

2490
01:51:55,240 --> 01:52:00,240
I went to South Africa when I was in 
high school and absence was legal there 

2491
01:52:00,240 --> 01:52:03,781
and it wasn't legal here yet.
And you hear about the Green Butterfly 

2492
01:52:03,781 --> 01:52:04,740
and hallucinating and it's awful.
It feels like black licorice,

2493
01:52:04,741 --> 01:52:06,410
like it's not good.
I liked it.

2494
01:52:06,550 --> 01:52:08,920
Didn't drinking a drink and drink.
You get with the sugar.

2495
01:52:08,980 --> 01:52:13,980
The thing I just got shit faced.
No hallucinations because it's not made 

2496
01:52:13,980 --> 01:52:15,400
with wormwood anymore,
which is what makes you do that.

2497
01:52:16,010 --> 01:52:18,940
Can drink absinthe all day long.
You will not hallucinate from it.

2498
01:52:18,990 --> 01:52:23,990
So That's interesting.
Does anybody make it the other way with 

2499
01:52:23,990 --> 01:52:23,990
the wormwood?
Nobody had done it.

2500
01:52:23,990 --> 01:52:26,380
So in general I think poisoning you.
Whoa.

2501
01:52:26,590 --> 01:52:28,030
But anyways,
you can't like it's just,

2502
01:52:28,180 --> 01:52:31,330
it used to be that way and it's not an,
it's not quite the same as drunk.

2503
01:52:31,330 --> 01:52:32,160
Right?
It's a little bit.

2504
01:52:32,200 --> 01:52:33,520
I sit down,
say I describe it as that.

2505
01:52:33,540 --> 01:52:37,150
It was like a cousin of drunk.
I also drink a lot of other stuff.

2506
01:52:37,660 --> 01:52:42,660
I enjoyed it.
I did it in Vancouver with the hottest 

2507
01:52:42,660 --> 01:52:44,680
South Africa.
Did you like his accent?

2508
01:52:44,930 --> 01:52:49,930
Say First Black Guy.
What if he said something really racist 

2509
01:52:49,930 --> 01:52:49,930
right before.
What?

2510
01:52:49,930 --> 01:52:51,830
What have you said something really 
racist right before he put it in because

2511
01:52:51,831 --> 01:52:54,790
you just saw the gate.
They get kinda racist.

2512
01:52:54,810 --> 01:52:57,710
You may not with them though.
Thinking about that bathroom and then we

2513
01:52:57,711 --> 01:52:58,860
got kicked out because I probably 
wouldn't.

2514
01:52:59,420 --> 01:53:02,000
You're a dirty bitch.
I love it.

2515
01:53:02,660 --> 01:53:05,510
That's what I'm talking about.
So are you drunk and angry?

2516
01:53:05,511 --> 01:53:07,840
Drunk or a happy to answer a question 
that.

2517
01:53:07,870 --> 01:53:09,920
Why are you putting the angry part out?
They're tired.

2518
01:53:09,940 --> 01:53:11,660
Drunk wine.
Red Wine.

2519
01:53:11,661 --> 01:53:14,320
Drunk is the worst.
Can I just,

2520
01:53:14,330 --> 01:53:19,330
well,
here's my thing is my birthday's coming 

2521
01:53:19,330 --> 01:53:19,330
up and I'm going to do one.

2522
01:53:19,330 --> 01:53:22,730
Did you like a full on asshole birthday 
where you get drunk and were like a tiny

2523
01:53:22,731 --> 01:53:24,210
dress and get a table?
Right?

2524
01:53:24,410 --> 01:53:27,890
Really?
That's my last birthday in my twenties,

2525
01:53:28,260 --> 01:53:30,710
so I want to have a party like I'm in my
twenties.

2526
01:53:30,800 --> 01:53:32,240
I have addressed.
It's this big.

2527
01:53:32,480 --> 01:53:37,480
It's actually a sock and I'm going to 
fit into it and I'm just going to bring 

2528
01:53:37,480 --> 01:53:40,691
a bunch of girls with me.
Can we videotape and we just let know 

2529
01:53:40,691 --> 01:53:40,691
what bar is.
Can we videotape?

2530
01:53:41,840 --> 01:53:44,120
Sounds like there'll be a good address 
for following day.

2531
01:53:44,420 --> 01:53:47,070
Smell.
Brian?

2532
01:53:48,120 --> 01:53:53,120
I get afraid because I never drink.
I mean I just don't ever have a chance 

2533
01:53:53,120 --> 01:53:54,110
to go on part.
I'm afraid that I'll have two drinks and

2534
01:53:54,111 --> 01:53:56,560
be tired and miserable.
Right Boulevard.

2535
01:53:56,561 --> 01:53:57,530
Well,
do you take vitamins?

2536
01:53:57,930 --> 01:54:01,740
You take multivitamins and deed healthy.
I eat very healthy sleep.

2537
01:54:02,410 --> 01:54:05,460
Good hours night.
Do you really need.

2538
01:54:05,870 --> 01:54:08,090
Well that's awesome.
That's awesome.

2539
01:54:08,150 --> 01:54:10,160
Nothing to get up for in the morning.
That's good though.

2540
01:54:10,161 --> 01:54:11,360
That's good.
You're well rested,

2541
01:54:11,480 --> 01:54:13,890
but vitamins are important.
Even on a healthy diet,

2542
01:54:13,891 --> 01:54:16,730
um,
I believe very strongly in vitamins have

2543
01:54:16,731 --> 01:54:19,250
had health issues that were corrected by
vitamins.

2544
01:54:19,540 --> 01:54:21,670
Take them every day.
Take that shit.

2545
01:54:23,180 --> 01:54:27,160
That's the shit for you.
You want to take it with them?

2546
01:54:28,220 --> 01:54:31,310
I'll give you the all the other stuff to
you don't want flashlight.

2547
01:54:33,050 --> 01:54:36,620
What am I going to use that for?
Practice friends to come over.

2548
01:54:36,621 --> 01:54:40,130
I don't want anyone to come over and see
that it can be a novelty.

2549
01:54:40,190 --> 01:54:45,190
I mean sitting on my couch and one of my
bras was behind me and it's not like a 

2550
01:54:50,011 --> 01:54:55,011
cute,
like rather large breasts.

2551
01:54:55,731 --> 01:54:59,550
So do you have to have special 
supporting sears?

2552
01:55:00,280 --> 01:55:04,590
I'm not poor,
but oh my God,

2553
01:55:04,591 --> 01:55:09,591
you know,
one of the few places you can actually 

2554
01:55:09,591 --> 01:55:10,250
have like custom made brawls if your 
boobs are too big for a normal playing,

2555
01:55:10,260 --> 01:55:11,140
they can.

2556
01:55:13,300 --> 01:55:18,300
One of them is well yeah,
it's a little wishbone in there and 

2557
01:55:25,891 --> 01:55:27,680
that's where the wishbone and like a 
tooth.

2558
01:55:29,260 --> 01:55:31,070
Well we could,
we could take it out,

2559
01:55:31,071 --> 01:55:36,071
but we might you to choose which just 
wish bone and tooth written tit sounds 

2560
01:55:37,271 --> 01:55:42,050
like rappers.
That's my new group.

2561
01:55:42,051 --> 01:55:42,960
That's my policy.
It is my,

2562
01:55:43,050 --> 01:55:48,050
my boy wishbone,
and this is a written tit anyways,

2563
01:55:48,460 --> 01:55:53,460
my brothers behind me and that was 
embarrassing enough that someone saw 

2564
01:55:53,460 --> 01:55:53,460
that I don't want a flashlight sitting 
around me,

2565
01:55:55,290 --> 01:55:58,620
ugly Brown.
These are strangers and I can understand

2566
01:55:58,621 --> 01:56:03,621
if you deliberately do it,
but when someone sees into your home 

2567
01:56:03,621 --> 01:56:03,621
without you knowing like the fact that 
they saw that and I hadn't,

2568
01:56:03,870 --> 01:56:05,350
I wasn't aware of it.
No,

2569
01:56:05,460 --> 01:56:07,230
it's an ugly bra also.
It's not like,

2570
01:56:07,260 --> 01:56:07,800
oh,
that's hot.

2571
01:56:07,801 --> 01:56:10,380
Like no one's ever looked at like a nude
colored Bra.

2572
01:56:10,381 --> 01:56:14,590
And like is that to minimize under your 
tee shirts?

2573
01:56:14,590 --> 01:56:19,010
Like this is not right.
I guess if I was at CIC.

2574
01:56:19,250 --> 01:56:22,350
Yeah,
it's not like kids don't give a fuck too

2575
01:56:22,930 --> 01:56:24,510
sweaty shirts and shit.
Oh,

2576
01:56:24,511 --> 01:56:25,840
I thought you meant for looking at 
broad.

2577
01:56:26,580 --> 01:56:30,290
Coming over a girl's house and find ugly
broad cupra is fine.

2578
01:56:30,590 --> 01:56:33,210
Your mind,
and this is grandma,

2579
01:56:33,250 --> 01:56:36,180
but grandma Lee,
by the time I'll just show you a picture

2580
01:56:36,181 --> 01:56:41,181
of an ugly Brah.
I don't know what kind of guys you're 

2581
01:56:41,181 --> 01:56:43,461
hanging out with,
but any guy that gets turned off by a 

2582
01:56:43,461 --> 01:56:44,790
fucking brawl and around turned off,
but there are more attractive.

2583
01:56:44,791 --> 01:56:47,160
Not that I want to turn.
I don't give a fuck.

2584
01:56:47,161 --> 01:56:52,161
Are you crazy?
You just showing different idea of 

2585
01:56:52,161 --> 01:56:55,160
what's good and bad and what's nice and 
not nice Villi.

2586
01:56:55,180 --> 01:56:57,360
We walked in your house.
There's a blog on the ground.

2587
01:56:57,361 --> 01:56:59,300
We would laugh.
You would,

2588
01:56:59,370 --> 01:57:04,370
but.
And I understand guys don't care like 

2589
01:57:04,370 --> 01:57:04,370
girls like,
oh,

2590
01:57:04,370 --> 01:57:04,370
it doesn't match.

2591
01:57:04,370 --> 01:57:04,370
He doesn't give a fuck.
I totally get that.

2592
01:57:04,370 --> 01:57:07,120
I'm just saying if you had a choice of 
looking at like a really cute lacy black

2593
01:57:07,230 --> 01:57:10,620
versus like grandma's nude,
full coverage utility Bra,

2594
01:57:10,910 --> 01:57:12,990
you'd rather see the cute one?
Well I guess,

2595
01:57:12,991 --> 01:57:15,600
but I really don't give a fuck.
It's all for you.

2596
01:57:15,830 --> 01:57:20,830
Would not.
Most guys don't give a shit about 

2597
01:57:20,830 --> 01:57:20,830
lingerie.
Get that shit off.

2598
01:57:20,830 --> 01:57:21,210
I want to see your body.
I agree.

2599
01:57:21,211 --> 01:57:26,211
I don't get turned on by.
You can pick your dog up because I have 

2600
01:57:26,211 --> 01:57:26,410
a litter box in here for real,
for her breakfast.

2601
01:57:26,411 --> 01:57:31,411
Smelled like shit.
That would be the circle of life.

2602
01:57:32,040 --> 01:57:34,360
You're such a strange personalizes,
Joe.

2603
01:57:35,360 --> 01:57:37,410
Your little animal that you take care of
them.

2604
01:57:37,411 --> 01:57:38,130
Bring everywhere.

2605
01:57:43,450 --> 01:57:47,310
It's got teeth and shit.
That's not weird.

2606
01:57:47,490 --> 01:57:52,060
She was probably developed like kill 
rats in the sewer to write her.

2607
01:57:52,890 --> 01:57:55,100
She breaks her neck.
She's half long or longer.

2608
01:57:55,130 --> 01:57:56,810
Chihuahua.
What kind of.

2609
01:57:56,940 --> 01:57:58,440
What is the first one?
Half long hair.

2610
01:57:59,160 --> 01:58:00,430
Long hair.
I see that.

2611
01:58:00,930 --> 01:58:05,930
That's a cool mix.
Didn't they make Dotson's for that very 

2612
01:58:05,930 --> 01:58:07,470
reason to go after things like that's 
where the long bodies.

2613
01:58:07,471 --> 01:58:10,240
A little short legs going rat holes or 
something like it.

2614
01:58:10,241 --> 01:58:12,330
Wasn't that like Jack Russell terriers 
known?

2615
01:58:12,380 --> 01:58:17,380
They bred them for that.
Jack Russell terriers are aggressive 

2616
01:58:17,380 --> 01:58:17,460
little doggies going after squirrels and
shit.

2617
01:58:17,610 --> 01:58:21,360
It's just blanche ever bark.
Is it a barker barker like squirrels and

2618
01:58:21,361 --> 01:58:23,400
stuff.
She's not a social dog.

2619
01:58:23,401 --> 01:58:25,800
She doesn't care like for other dogs.
When your dog eats poop,

2620
01:58:25,801 --> 01:58:28,170
does it make you love her?
Little bit less.

2621
01:58:28,200 --> 01:58:29,940
She doesn't do it.
It's disappointing.

2622
01:58:29,941 --> 01:58:31,120
It's like finding out your daughter 
does.

2623
01:58:35,300 --> 01:58:37,590
She's a good girl.
I mean look at that face,

2624
01:58:38,500 --> 01:58:42,360
but that's what my dog does.
We eat.

2625
01:58:42,370 --> 01:58:45,250
It's not like she takes every day,
she's not going to pass up on it if it's

2626
01:58:45,251 --> 01:58:46,010
on the.
Yeah,

2627
01:58:46,640 --> 01:58:51,640
it's got to have a bit about that.
Didn't you park on gross just with your 

2628
01:58:52,451 --> 01:58:54,000
pets,
with your daughters?

2629
01:58:54,001 --> 01:58:55,930
Like could you like.
Do you ever get this like aggressive?

2630
01:58:55,970 --> 01:58:59,200
Like with my daughter's?
A little bit,

2631
01:58:59,201 --> 01:59:04,201
but not really with my pets.
It was freaked my cat out and my dogs 

2632
01:59:04,201 --> 01:59:04,910
pretty big.
You don't really want him getting him to

2633
01:59:04,911 --> 01:59:05,920
do well.
You don't want to your face,

2634
01:59:05,921 --> 01:59:10,921
but when you love something in my act 
they talk about how I want to rip her 

2635
01:59:10,921 --> 01:59:10,921
face off.
Like when you love something so much,

2636
01:59:10,921 --> 01:59:12,930
I just want to hurt it.
Like that's a girl thing.

2637
01:59:14,570 --> 01:59:15,370
Yeah,
that's a girl.

2638
01:59:15,371 --> 01:59:20,371
That's why relationships always end up 
fucking hurt you.

2639
01:59:22,760 --> 01:59:25,240
The little freak seems like that's true 
though.

2640
01:59:25,241 --> 01:59:29,140
Like good girls always want to hurt with
me.

2641
01:59:29,420 --> 01:59:30,160
Well,
you might.

2642
01:59:30,250 --> 01:59:31,960
It might just be you.
I mean,

2643
01:59:31,961 --> 01:59:33,910
how many times fake abortions did I pay 
for?

2644
01:59:36,360 --> 01:59:40,270
Powerful people?
Powerful people.

2645
01:59:40,271 --> 01:59:42,360
This fucking podcast is over this 
lesson.

2646
01:59:42,480 --> 01:59:43,450
Zero.
People want to find you,

2647
01:59:43,451 --> 01:59:45,190
if they want to catch you out there in 
the wild world.

2648
01:59:45,480 --> 01:59:48,800
What did they get on twitter?
You're on twitter at Ilm.

2649
01:59:49,310 --> 01:59:51,260
Which z?
A.

2650
01:59:51,261 --> 01:59:52,010
And we,
uh,

2651
01:59:52,510 --> 01:59:56,710
we will tweak this after the show,
which we did it before the show as well.

2652
01:59:57,310 --> 01:59:59,410
And uh,
what's your website at?

2653
02:00:00,340 --> 02:00:01,810
[inaudible] DOT com.
Really?

2654
02:00:02,050 --> 02:00:04,290
How'd you get both of those spells?
Her name like me.

2655
02:00:04,450 --> 02:00:05,470
Oh,
that's awesome.

2656
02:00:05,860 --> 02:00:06,850
Oh,
you're so lucky.

2657
02:00:07,120 --> 02:00:09,790
It's so easy to remember it,
but no one spells like that.

2658
02:00:09,791 --> 02:00:12,400
So everyone's like,
I tried it with an e and I couldn't find

2659
02:00:12,401 --> 02:00:17,401
you.
Where are you going to be doing your 

2660
02:00:17,401 --> 02:00:19,150
little standup comedy routine at the Lol
Comedy Club in San Antonio?

2661
02:00:19,380 --> 02:00:21,980
Lol.
Comedy Club in San San Antonio.

2662
02:00:23,800 --> 02:00:25,840
What part of San Antonio is a near the 
river?

2663
02:00:26,360 --> 02:00:27,550
That's off the for 10 loop.

2664
02:00:27,940 --> 02:00:28,510
Oh,
okay.

2665
02:00:28,511 --> 02:00:33,511
Cool.
And so there's two comedy clubs in San 

2666
02:00:33,511 --> 02:00:33,511
Antonio now.
I don't know.

2667
02:00:33,511 --> 02:00:33,511
I think there was another one,
right?

2668
02:00:33,511 --> 02:00:33,910
Wasn't there another one?
We're pauly shore.

2669
02:00:33,920 --> 02:00:37,240
Get punched the fake punch incident.
I don't remember that.

2670
02:00:38,070 --> 02:00:43,070
They made a fake video about beating him
up and everybody gets so excited that 

2671
02:00:43,070 --> 02:00:45,910
it'd be that he got beat up.
It was really horrible,

2672
02:00:45,911 --> 02:00:50,911
man.
That was the first time because there 

2673
02:00:50,911 --> 02:00:50,911
was one of the first celebrity,
things like that where it got fake.

2674
02:00:50,911 --> 02:00:54,961
Something like he punches him,
isn't that a guy gets on stage and the 

2675
02:00:55,481 --> 02:00:57,880
guy is fucking huge and the and then the
video,

2676
02:00:57,881 --> 02:01:00,010
they released it afterwards.
It's him working it out,

2677
02:01:00,160 --> 02:01:03,260
but the negative comments after the 
first video was,

2678
02:01:03,910 --> 02:01:04,960
fuck that.
Faggot.

2679
02:01:04,961 --> 02:01:09,961
Punch him in the face of the things they
hate that he received must have been 

2680
02:01:09,961 --> 02:01:13,020
horrific to know that people feel like 
that about you.

2681
02:01:13,570 --> 02:01:15,670
So many people and that it was so 
accepted.

2682
02:01:15,790 --> 02:01:18,010
There was no one standing up for them.
There was no one was going,

2683
02:01:18,011 --> 02:01:20,200
hey man in the army now is one of my 
favorite all time movies.

2684
02:01:20,560 --> 02:01:22,000
Fuck you.
You know you're,

2685
02:01:22,001 --> 02:01:24,880
you're the asshole police job.
Makes millions of people smart.

2686
02:01:25,580 --> 02:01:28,330
That was some hardcore.
That was intense.

2687
02:01:28,840 --> 02:01:30,850
It was intense.
It was horrible moment in your life.

2688
02:01:31,930 --> 02:01:33,460
Texas.
They fucking party though.

2689
02:01:33,790 --> 02:01:36,520
I do love going back to Texas.
We haven't been in awhile.

2690
02:01:36,700 --> 02:01:39,470
I think a next next Gig is going to do 
as an Austin,

2691
02:01:40,460 --> 02:01:41,990
trying to work that shit out for the 
spring.

2692
02:01:42,370 --> 02:01:44,270
Probably don't play clubs.
You do like theaters?

2693
02:01:44,450 --> 02:01:47,930
I do clubs and theater.
See I've been coming to this one club in

2694
02:01:47,931 --> 02:01:52,931
Austin for so long.
It would feel weird if I didn't go back 

2695
02:01:52,931 --> 02:01:52,931
there.
Yeah,

2696
02:01:52,931 --> 02:01:54,440
I performed,
I did my first DVD there in 1999,

2697
02:01:54,680 --> 02:01:57,410
so I can't,
that's my spot.

2698
02:01:57,900 --> 02:02:00,140
A really humbling moment I had at cap 
city.

2699
02:02:00,141 --> 02:02:04,970
Aside from when a fan brought a buck 
knife to meet me on his belt.

2700
02:02:04,971 --> 02:02:06,540
So you saw it or was behind him?
Yeah.

2701
02:02:06,940 --> 02:02:07,760
Oh good.
It came up.

2702
02:02:07,761 --> 02:02:08,450
He was like,
hey.

2703
02:02:08,451 --> 02:02:10,010
It was very like,
what is your problem?

2704
02:02:10,320 --> 02:02:11,630
Uh,
when I called and I was like,

2705
02:02:11,631 --> 02:02:12,770
Hey,
I'm driving over,

2706
02:02:12,771 --> 02:02:14,480
um,
where can I park?

2707
02:02:14,570 --> 02:02:16,730
And they didn't care that I was a 
headline and they're like a.

2708
02:02:16,740 --> 02:02:19,850
There was a hobby lobby across the 
street across the freeway,

2709
02:02:20,250 --> 02:02:22,220
just park over at the hobby lobby.
I'm like,

2710
02:02:22,250 --> 02:02:25,490
there's no parking from no hobby lobby.
I'm like,

2711
02:02:25,520 --> 02:02:27,350
oh,
I'll just make the height the headliner.

2712
02:02:27,970 --> 02:02:32,970
That's not even true.
You know there's a back alley where 

2713
02:02:32,970 --> 02:02:32,970
there's always.
It's always park right behind.

2714
02:02:32,970 --> 02:02:35,690
Not only do they wait for us to,
but I think we are men.

2715
02:02:35,930 --> 02:02:36,640
It's different.
Sorry.

2716
02:02:36,641 --> 02:02:41,641
Weird.
Maybe I should've been more assertive 

2717
02:02:41,641 --> 02:02:41,641
and general.
I should be more aggressive.

2718
02:02:41,641 --> 02:02:42,920
Maybe it was a.
was it a girl answering the phone?

2719
02:02:43,200 --> 02:02:45,100
Maybe she didn't know or maybe it was 
like a night,

2720
02:02:45,140 --> 02:02:47,660
like a manager that didn't know and I'm 
not the kind of person they'd be like,

2721
02:02:47,661 --> 02:02:51,880
do you know who I am?
She's on her way.

2722
02:02:52,690 --> 02:02:53,510
Go get her.

2723
02:02:57,830 --> 02:02:59,780
What?
We're talking about cap cities.

2724
02:03:00,310 --> 02:03:03,320
You were saying you love Austin and I 
was saying I'll be in San Antonio.

2725
02:03:03,650 --> 02:03:08,650
Yeah,
but you were talking about them not 

2726
02:03:08,650 --> 02:03:08,650
giving you.
Oh,

2727
02:03:08,650 --> 02:03:08,650
lobby.
Do you think that that's like a girl.

2728
02:03:08,650 --> 02:03:10,490
The girl just didn't want like she was 
answering the phone,

2729
02:03:10,491 --> 02:03:13,100
like fucking female comedian going to 
come in and lie on.

2730
02:03:13,120 --> 02:03:18,120
Females ain't even even get it because 
it wasn't even the first night and I 

2731
02:03:18,120 --> 02:03:22,611
think it was so many times we don't 
realize how a lot of people that have 

2732
02:03:22,611 --> 02:03:23,600
jobs in general.
You were in a comedy club.

2733
02:03:23,750 --> 02:03:28,750
They're not necessarily up to like,
they don't really know what's going on 

2734
02:03:28,750 --> 02:03:32,280
on.
Could've been that or maybe there was 

2735
02:03:32,280 --> 02:03:33,851
something,
there might've been something going on 

2736
02:03:33,851 --> 02:03:33,851
where they were doing maintenance and 
you couldn't park.

2737
02:03:33,851 --> 02:03:37,091
I just,
it was such an odd thing and I as a 

2738
02:03:37,091 --> 02:03:37,091
girl,
it's so quick.

2739
02:03:37,091 --> 02:03:41,640
You're so,
it's so easy to get labeled a mean name 

2740
02:03:41,640 --> 02:03:41,640
that you stand up.
So I just,

2741
02:03:41,640 --> 02:03:42,080
sometimes I'm just very like,
okay,

2742
02:03:42,140 --> 02:03:44,180
no problem.
Did you hear that?

2743
02:03:44,181 --> 02:03:45,000
Um,
what,

2744
02:03:45,010 --> 02:03:50,010
what the fuck is his name again?
The good fired and brill who got fired 

2745
02:03:50,010 --> 02:03:50,010
from letterman?
He say,

2746
02:03:50,090 --> 02:03:51,140
he said,
uh,

2747
02:03:51,141 --> 02:03:52,340
what was it?
Women?

2748
02:03:52,760 --> 02:03:57,760
Something about how women try to be more
like men in their act and that's why 

2749
02:03:57,760 --> 02:04:01,961
they're not funny or something.
I 100 percent think that there's no way 

2750
02:04:01,961 --> 02:04:02,720
he got fired because of that one 
comment.

2751
02:04:03,170 --> 02:04:04,490
Like,
let's get serious.

2752
02:04:04,610 --> 02:04:09,610
I don't know what else he did,
but no one stands up for women that 

2753
02:04:09,610 --> 02:04:12,790
much.
Like women get raped every day and 

2754
02:04:12,790 --> 02:04:12,790
people can still keep their jobs.
Probably just a bad poker hand.

2755
02:04:12,790 --> 02:04:13,070
Yeah.
Yeah.

2756
02:04:13,071 --> 02:04:18,071
But it's,
it's different when you're on a show 

2757
02:04:18,071 --> 02:04:18,071
like that where you hear the judge.

2758
02:04:18,071 --> 02:04:18,430
Yeah.
When you're the one who's a,

2759
02:04:18,620 --> 02:04:23,620
your job is to discern who's capable of 
being on the show and if you say 

2760
02:04:23,620 --> 02:04:25,850
something so blatantly sexist and so 
blatantly judgmental,

2761
02:04:25,851 --> 02:04:29,600
like he's formed an opinion and it's one
of the reasons why women can't be funny,

2762
02:04:29,740 --> 02:04:31,620
man.
He didn't even qualify it with know.

2763
02:04:31,850 --> 02:04:36,850
There are some women that try to be like
men and you know that it's a balanced 

2764
02:04:36,850 --> 02:04:37,890
and it's a balancing act,
which it is.

2765
02:04:37,891 --> 02:04:40,650
I think it's more difficult for a woman.
Some shitty comics,

2766
02:04:40,830 --> 02:04:43,680
sorry.
A lot of them are shitty and watch those

2767
02:04:43,681 --> 02:04:48,681
tapes and I've never sent in a tape so I
was actually upset that his sentence 

2768
02:04:48,681 --> 02:04:49,680
wasn't.
Except for Eliza Schlesinger,

2769
02:04:49,681 --> 02:04:54,681
she's awesome.
I genuinely thought I would be included 

2770
02:04:54,681 --> 02:04:57,801
in the conversation.
Were you upset when you hear shit like 

2771
02:04:57,801 --> 02:04:57,801
that?
Like someone said,

2772
02:04:57,801 --> 02:04:59,250
do you feel like the debt like gives you
like a ramp that you have to like run up

2773
02:04:59,251 --> 02:05:01,440
where everybody else has like a,
an even start?

2774
02:05:01,650 --> 02:05:06,650
I gotta be honest.
I feel that my act is just so different 

2775
02:05:06,650 --> 02:05:10,911
than every other girl that I just don't 
include myself in the same category as 

2776
02:05:10,911 --> 02:05:13,260
the most female comics was that I just 
do,

2777
02:05:13,261 --> 02:05:14,550
I just,
I see the audience,

2778
02:05:14,551 --> 02:05:19,551
I see my material,
I see topics that most women talk about 

2779
02:05:19,551 --> 02:05:20,820
versus what I talk about and the 
approaches and stuff like that.

2780
02:05:21,240 --> 02:05:24,960
And I just have never viewed women as 
the competition.

2781
02:05:25,290 --> 02:05:29,240
I think of everyone as a competition,
but I just don't.

2782
02:05:29,250 --> 02:05:31,380
Um,
I've never seen a girl.

2783
02:05:31,410 --> 02:05:36,410
You really do though.
You really do think of people as the 

2784
02:05:36,410 --> 02:05:38,541
competition,
which I always thought it was 

2785
02:05:38,541 --> 02:05:38,541
fascinating because that was a very 
competitive person,

2786
02:05:38,541 --> 02:05:41,931
but I tried to never look at other 
comics has competition because I think 

2787
02:05:41,931 --> 02:05:43,350
it's unhealthy.
I think the way to look at comics as use

2788
02:05:43,351 --> 02:05:45,810
them for inspiration,
be inspired by them,

2789
02:05:45,811 --> 02:05:48,170
but when you know,
it's not like you're playing a game with

2790
02:05:48,171 --> 02:05:49,200
it to keep you from doing it.

2791
02:05:49,200 --> 02:05:54,200
It's not like you're playing football 
and they can keep you from getting the 

2792
02:05:54,200 --> 02:05:54,200
ball.
No direct competition.

2793
02:05:54,200 --> 02:05:54,200
It's,
you know,

2794
02:05:54,200 --> 02:05:54,340
you're,
you're,

2795
02:05:54,460 --> 02:05:55,530
you're smart about it.
I don't,

2796
02:05:55,630 --> 02:05:58,020
I don't go online and watch everyone 
else and going,

2797
02:05:58,021 --> 02:05:59,730
I don't Google other people.
It's not like that,

2798
02:05:59,731 --> 02:06:02,510
but I don't ever watch other acts at the
clubs and stuff and I'll.

2799
02:06:02,550 --> 02:06:07,550
Sometimes I'll go on,
I'll watch certain ones that I really 

2800
02:06:07,550 --> 02:06:07,550
liked but I don't do it out of being 
envious and I,

2801
02:06:07,550 --> 02:06:08,070
you know,
you keep an ear to it.

2802
02:06:08,071 --> 02:06:13,071
Oh that shit,
he auditioned for that or she did this 

2803
02:06:13,071 --> 02:06:15,531
or that's a showcase you get.
I like going and watching people online 

2804
02:06:15,531 --> 02:06:17,730
because it gives me like a charge.
I get excited if I see somebody good.

2805
02:06:17,731 --> 02:06:22,731
Like if somebody sends me a clip,
hey check this guy out and I go watch 

2806
02:06:22,731 --> 02:06:22,731
and it's really fun.

2807
02:06:22,731 --> 02:06:22,920
I go,
that's fucking funny.

2808
02:06:22,921 --> 02:06:26,430
I'm going to write this or I'll get 
charged up like,

2809
02:06:26,431 --> 02:06:30,690
well I want to create something cool 
that does to me or does to someone else.

2810
02:06:30,691 --> 02:06:34,140
The way that did to me.
I felt the first time I saw Dane Cook,

2811
02:06:34,300 --> 02:06:35,670
like,
this is a long time ago,

2812
02:06:35,671 --> 02:06:40,671
this must have been five years ago,
and I had just started and someone took 

2813
02:06:40,671 --> 02:06:42,180
me the laugh factory and it was like 
that tour guides and it was fucking like

2814
02:06:42,181 --> 02:06:44,010
no one else had.
When did you start with you?

2815
02:06:44,890 --> 02:06:47,490
I must.
I graduated college in 2005,

2816
02:06:47,491 --> 02:06:49,270
so maybe I start 2006.
2,000.

2817
02:06:49,880 --> 02:06:52,590
That's pretty fresh.
That's kind of amazing.

2818
02:06:52,591 --> 02:06:53,120
You know,
and you want.

2819
02:06:53,160 --> 02:06:58,160
So you won the last comic standing.
You have only been doing it for like 

2820
02:06:58,160 --> 02:06:58,160
what?
Four years?

2821
02:06:58,160 --> 02:06:58,160
Three years.
Three years.

2822
02:06:58,160 --> 02:06:59,640
That's amazing.
When I see comedy,

2823
02:06:59,641 --> 02:07:01,470
I like it.
It makes me happy.

2824
02:07:01,470 --> 02:07:02,340
I've never think,
oh,

2825
02:07:02,341 --> 02:07:05,340
I want to start headlining on the road 
right after last comment.

2826
02:07:05,370 --> 02:07:06,660
That is crazy.
They were like,

2827
02:07:06,661 --> 02:07:08,640
by the way,
your headliner now and how much time did

2828
02:07:08,641 --> 02:07:13,641
you have?
I had 45 minutes already after three 

2829
02:07:13,641 --> 02:07:14,670
years from doing last comic.
You just start building.

2830
02:07:14,790 --> 02:07:17,940
I'm not saying it was the most solid,
but when they tell you,

2831
02:07:17,941 --> 02:07:20,580
by the way you have to headline,
now you have one shot.

2832
02:07:20,581 --> 02:07:22,230
The headline,
and if you fuck it up,

2833
02:07:22,231 --> 02:07:27,231
they're going to put you at the bottom 
of the list and a lot of guys did do 

2834
02:07:27,231 --> 02:07:27,840
that so and I,
I knew that and I was just like,

2835
02:07:27,870 --> 02:07:32,870
I'm not going to give it.
I'm going to make sure I had all the 

2836
02:07:32,870 --> 02:07:32,870
people that did really well from last 
column.

2837
02:07:32,870 --> 02:07:36,430
It's like you.
I'm Heffron Ralphie May

2838
02:07:37,480 --> 02:07:39,040
and a couple of other people,
right?

2839
02:07:39,220 --> 02:07:40,150
John.
John,

2840
02:07:40,480 --> 02:07:43,510
John Reed did really well.
What is that,

2841
02:07:43,511 --> 02:07:48,511
Rick Ross,
the rappers I sent you.

2842
02:07:48,850 --> 02:07:51,760
Rick Ross.
Just like some black guy,

2843
02:07:52,800 --> 02:07:53,980
black.
I was cock hanging out.

2844
02:07:54,090 --> 02:07:56,740
The big.
That is for me,

2845
02:07:56,741 --> 02:08:00,670
that just in case I might need that 
uncircumcised.

2846
02:08:00,680 --> 02:08:04,180
That's gross.
Sacking of uncircumcised.

2847
02:08:04,240 --> 02:08:09,240
This podcast is brought to you by the 
fleshlight fleshlight thanks to the 

2848
02:08:09,240 --> 02:08:11,200
legislature for being hilarious.
He's always really,

2849
02:08:11,230 --> 02:08:12,250
really fun.
This was.

2850
02:08:12,520 --> 02:08:17,520
This was even better.
We know each other better than the last 

2851
02:08:17,520 --> 02:08:17,520
time we did it.
It was much more loose and relaxed.

2852
02:08:17,520 --> 02:08:19,290
I think you're going to take me 
fighting.

2853
02:08:19,730 --> 02:08:20,980
I would totally.
I'll tell you.

2854
02:08:20,981 --> 02:08:25,470
I'll take you to the gym.
I'll teach you some more Tai Chi class,

2855
02:08:25,710 --> 02:08:27,730
kick people's legs.
It's fun.

2856
02:08:28,090 --> 02:08:33,090
It's great exercise to it.
It gives you like something like it 

2857
02:08:33,090 --> 02:08:33,090
gives you some,
it gives you a scale,

2858
02:08:33,090 --> 02:08:37,441
but it also gives you like something to 
do at the gym or something to fall back 

2859
02:08:37,441 --> 02:08:37,441
on when the standard is.

2860
02:08:37,441 --> 02:08:39,970
I bet you can be a serious fighter if 
you want them to be very,

2861
02:08:40,120 --> 02:08:45,120
very smart and you're very competitive.
All you have to do is do the right 

2862
02:08:45,120 --> 02:08:45,120
steps,
you know,

2863
02:08:45,120 --> 02:08:46,540
don't slack off.
Be disciplined on where do those are.

2864
02:08:46,600 --> 02:08:47,610
Those are legit,
right?

2865
02:08:47,680 --> 02:08:50,160
Those,
they're not silicone.

2866
02:08:50,320 --> 02:08:51,130
Well that's good.
Well,

2867
02:08:51,131 --> 02:08:54,780
they actually have a chest protectors.
They have a silicone.

2868
02:08:55,300 --> 02:08:56,170
These things.
Yeah.

2869
02:08:56,171 --> 02:09:00,030
You were like a hard plastic goes like a
protector sort of.

2870
02:09:00,720 --> 02:09:02,200
Yeah.
I don't know how much it helps.

2871
02:09:02,620 --> 02:09:03,910
I mean I don't know what the science 
behind it is.

2872
02:09:03,911 --> 02:09:06,490
They've developed some pretty good 
science for the balls recently.

2873
02:09:06,491 --> 02:09:09,600
They have some new stuff to politics.
Paul Science,

2874
02:09:09,620 --> 02:09:12,160
all our best ball scientists have been 
hard at work,

2875
02:09:12,340 --> 02:09:14,500
but they've been hard at work.

2876
02:09:17,390 --> 02:09:22,390
Clang.
Trying different combinations of things 

2877
02:09:22,390 --> 02:09:23,310
and hitting balls at balls.
Alright.

2878
02:09:23,410 --> 02:09:25,190
That's the end of this fucking hot cast 
allies here.

02:11:16,731 --> 02:11:21,731
I think it's really bad ass.
It's one of my favorite places and it's 

2925
02:11:21,731 --> 02:11:23,030
also where we do the ice house 
chronicles podcast,

2926
02:11:23,210 --> 02:11:26,090
which is why we're doing shows there.
Simultaneously.

2927
02:11:26,091 --> 02:11:28,910
We have a studio and we do podcasts at 
the same time.

2928
02:11:29,170 --> 02:11:32,300
This last year,
you've been on that podcast twice.

2929
02:11:32,301 --> 02:11:36,380
Once was a scratch and when when we do 
it,

2930
02:11:36,381 --> 02:11:38,180
it's really your key.
Your dog just went in there.

2931
02:11:38,450 --> 02:11:39,590
Go get.
He's eaten shit.

2932
02:11:39,710 --> 02:11:41,720
Jesus Christ.
Anyway,

2933
02:11:41,721 --> 02:11:45,800
I'm helping you out with whatever on 
a.com,

2934
02:11:45,801 --> 02:11:46,220
blah,
blah,

2935
02:11:46,221 --> 02:11:46,490
blah.

2936
02:11:46,610 --> 02:11:48,110
Okay,
so this Thursday night,

2937
02:11:48,290 --> 02:11:50,390
how'd they get to an ice house?
Ice House comedy dot Com.

2938
02:11:50,391 --> 02:11:53,390
We also have a show Friday without Joe 
Rogan by a bunch of other comics,

2939
02:11:53,450 --> 02:11:58,450
so icehouse comedy.com.
Also Friday if you're going to be in 

2940
02:11:58,450 --> 02:12:01,331
Vegas,
I am going to be with Joey Diaz and 

2941
02:12:01,331 --> 02:12:01,331

We're doing the house,

2942
02:12:01,331 --> 02:12:02,150
a motherfucking blues at the Mandalay 
Bay.

2943
02:12:02,180 --> 02:12:05,500
Then the next day it's Carlos condit and
Nick Diaz.

2944
02:12:06,390 --> 02:12:10,310
Christ fucking stars have aligned.
It's going to be crazy.

2945
02:12:10,311 --> 02:12:15,311
It's gonna be an awesome epic weekend 
between two of the best fighters on the 

2946
02:12:15,311 --> 02:12:17,900
planet earth in two of the three best,
170 pounders in the world.

2947
02:12:17,901 --> 02:12:20,000
And this is going to be chaos.
I can't fucking wait.

2948
02:12:20,150 --> 02:12:23,580
The whole card is the whole card sick.
Um,

The twitter account that I told you 

2957
02:12:45,581 --> 02:12:45,581
about.
That's hilarious.

2958

That is like a billion followers.
Michelle,

2959
02:12:45,581 --> 02:12:48,950
do you explain it again?
It's this guy a mac lethal and he's this

2960
02:12:48,951 --> 02:12:53,951
white guy who's got a cousin who thinks 
he's black and the guy sends him texts 

2961
02:12:53,951 --> 02:12:54,290
all the time.
He doesn't know that he has his account.

2962
02:12:55,020 --> 02:12:57,350
It's the funniest,
most ignorant stuff you've ever heard.

2963
02:12:57,470 --> 02:13:02,470
And he's created this account,
but he is a huge fan and he wanted you 

2964
02:13:02,470 --> 02:13:02,470
to know.
