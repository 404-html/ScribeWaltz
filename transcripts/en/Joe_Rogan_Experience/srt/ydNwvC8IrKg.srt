1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,780
Try by day Joe Rogan podcast by night.
All Day.

2
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:05,750
So how,
how long can you hold on?

3
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:10,290
I personally know I could go a week 
without water from my cuts and one 55 so

4
00:00:10,291 --> 00:00:12,050
I know I could do a week.
Yeah.

5
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:14,990
And that'd be after that.
I'm on my,

6
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:16,100
I'm on my death bed.
Yeah Dude,

7
00:00:16,101 --> 00:00:17,790
let's talk about that.
Don't do that anymore.

8
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:19,103
Don't do that anymore after that.
I know you keep talking about like 

9
00:00:21,091 --> 00:00:23,640
fighting Eddie Alvarez cause you already
beat him and now he's the champ.

10
00:00:23,641 --> 00:00:26,370
But God damn,
you're looking good at one 70 yeah.

11
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:27,223
So you say I didn't look good if 55 I've
sensation with 55 nine for 10 70 on my 

12
00:00:32,851 --> 00:00:34,900
last run world beater man,
it's,

13
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,880
it's not just that you look good,
it's just the way you look.

14
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,110
It's like you,
you,

15
00:00:40,111 --> 00:00:40,944
you hit a whole new level.
And I always wonder like is it because 

16
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,260
obviously you keep training,
obviously you keep getting better.

17
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:48,120
Obviously you work hard,
all those things,

18
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:51,180
learning from experience,
all those things are a factor.

19
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:52,253
But on top of that,
there's also the factor of you not 

20
00:00:55,471 --> 00:00:56,304
having a cut that fucking wait man.
So this last fight against rick story 

21
00:01:02,251 --> 00:01:03,084
against Rick Story.
It looked like you were in the fucking 

22
00:01:04,081 --> 00:01:06,000
matrix.
That was some Anderson Silva's shit.

23
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:09,720
I ate five guys three nights that we 
were in Vegas.

24
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,590
Five guys Burgers,
hamburger,

25
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:12,783
double doubles.
I'm a food bacon and of those 

26
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:16,230
[inaudible] and it was on though.
Of course.

27
00:01:16,231 --> 00:01:18,730
Yeah.
You get the Jalapeno did the season,

28
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:23,890
the season fries.
Of course my trainers are happier.

29
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,040
Yeah.
I mean I think I had six pounds to cut.

30
00:01:26,041 --> 00:01:27,920
It was an easy no brainer.
Yeah.

31
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,420
But when I saw you before the fight,
before that,

32
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,030
you were a one 76 when you were at the 
comedy store.

33
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:34,800
Yeah.
That's nothing.

34
00:01:34,801 --> 00:01:35,310
Nothing.

35
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:37,350
Yeah.
Look how good you look at this way.

36
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,390
I feel good.
That's for damn sure.

37
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:40,770
But it's not a factor.
I mean,

38
00:01:40,771 --> 00:01:43,560
look how fast you are.
Like the Kobe fight,

39
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:45,210
dude,
you were on fire.

40
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:47,700
You're on fire at that weight.
Yeah.

41
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:51,390
I Dunno.
What's the thought process can do one 55

42
00:01:51,391 --> 00:01:52,350
right?
You can do it.

43
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,273
You have what you want.
It's like 60 or 65 or 65 weight class 

44
00:01:56,911 --> 00:01:57,980
that be capitol.
He's like class,

45
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:00,690
but it's just that last five pounds.
His death for me.

46
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:01,860
Fucking brutal.
You know,

47
00:02:01,861 --> 00:02:05,280
from 60 to 55 I just feel like I got 
nothing left man.

48
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,740
I don't know if that carries over like,
like I want to ask,

49
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,130
you see pedis slipped a little tired.
Indian,

50
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:12,180
his last fight.
I don't know if the 45 cut,

51
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:14,250
if that has something to do with that 
for sure.

52
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:15,143
If it tastes the,
if your gas tank a little hundred 

53
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:18,720
percent a hundred percent it has to.

54
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,570
It has to,
right?

55
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:20,880
Yeah.
I feel great out there.

56
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:22,163
That's what I'm fucking love fighting 
and this is my favorite thing in the 

57
00:02:23,551 --> 00:02:27,460
whole world to do a and the whole world.
Like I wish a,

58
00:02:27,461 --> 00:02:28,294
all the,
when I leave here pulls up in parking 

59
00:02:29,581 --> 00:02:31,510
lot and tried to get some shit like that
to me,

60
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,530
you know,
and this is the way,

61
00:02:33,531 --> 00:02:34,364
it's the craziest thing to me.
People tell me like I posted version of 

62
00:02:37,651 --> 00:02:38,750
me flipping people off,
right?

63
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,670
So they're like,
gobble,

64
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,640
you were fucking role model.
How dare you?

65
00:02:41,641 --> 00:02:43,440
Like no I'm not.
I'm a,

66
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,393
I'm a bar junkie.
That fights all the time and you guys 

67
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:48,260
all on tv and you think is cool.
So you,

68
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,040
I'm your favorite fire.
You know?

69
00:02:50,041 --> 00:02:50,874
But had you not be in the USC,
I'd be the asshole trying to take your 

70
00:02:53,701 --> 00:02:55,430
girlfriend if fight you at the bar just 
as you're now.

71
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:59,030
That's who I would be.
You.

72
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:00,103
You know how many people sent me and the
animated Gif of that final combination 

73
00:03:03,911 --> 00:03:05,890
you landed on rick stories.
Talk about that.

74
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,070
Oh,
let's throw that up on the screen.

75
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:10,510
Well let's,
let's talk.

76
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,570
So everyone says how great this convoys,
oh,

77
00:03:13,571 --> 00:03:14,890
it's beautiful.
Okay,

78
00:03:14,891 --> 00:03:16,330
here it is.
All crack.

79
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,090
That's the end of it.
It was wash it from the beginning.

80
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,710
Well,
you know what I love about it man.

81
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:22,390
What I love,
I love technique.

82
00:03:22,391 --> 00:03:23,500
Look at this.
This is what I love.

83
00:03:23,501 --> 00:03:25,450
Pop to the body,
to the head.

84
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:27,010
Boom.
You know what I love about it?

85
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,770
Not a single one of those techniques is 
wound up.

86
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:32,260
Not a single one of those techniques is 
full power.

87
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:37,380
But look how you doing this pop bank,
crack blind.

88
00:03:37,571 --> 00:03:40,390
So for everyone that's listening,
all that is the jab,

89
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:41,680
cross,
Hook,

90
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:42,310
kick.

91
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:43,330
Yeah,
but it's not,

92
00:03:43,331 --> 00:03:46,750
because here's the thing about it,
the way you throwing all these things is

93
00:03:46,751 --> 00:03:49,480
the way everybody should throw every 
punch your,

94
00:03:49,481 --> 00:03:52,210
there's no windup.
Everything is perfect technique.

95
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:54,160
The execution,
the timing,

96
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:55,810
the,
the accuracy.

97
00:03:55,811 --> 00:03:57,280
Look how beautiful this is,
man.

98
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:58,280
See,
this is used.

99
00:03:58,281 --> 00:03:59,980
So I bet it's hard for you to 
appreciate.

100
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:04,720
But for me as a person who calls MMA as 
a person who watches fights do,

101
00:04:04,721 --> 00:04:06,610
when I was calling that fight,
I was like this.

102
00:04:06,611 --> 00:04:07,370
I was like,
Oh,

103
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:09,010
oh,
oh look at this.

104
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:10,060
Oh,
this is perfect.

105
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:13,090
Do you know how upset I missed the 
triangle I am with myself?

106
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:17,170
Oh my God,
he's a tough guy.

107
00:04:17,171 --> 00:04:20,280
He's got good submission defense.
So last time we talked,

108
00:04:20,281 --> 00:04:23,260
we talk about Calvin watching himself.
Like I'm playing a video game.

109
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:25,000
I was in the mode for sure.
Yeah,

110
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:25,863
for sure.

111
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:27,430
That's a matrix.
Shit.

112
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:28,383
I mean,
this to me is more impressive than when 

113
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,353
Anderson Silva knocked out forrest 
griffin because when Anderson Silva 

114
00:04:33,761 --> 00:04:34,594
knocked out forrest Griffin,
what I know about forest was that force 

115
00:04:37,051 --> 00:04:37,884
was compromised going into that fight.
He had been knocked out twice and 

116
00:04:39,641 --> 00:04:42,260
training camp.
He had a real hard time taking shots and

117
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:43,990
probably shouldn't have been in there in
the first place.

118
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:48,580
And so he had a lot of doubts and he was
having a real hard time.

119
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:53,530
This is a big powerful rick story who's 
a nasty motherfucker.

120
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:56,350
He throws vicious body shots.
He's a hard wrestler.

121
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:59,530
He's the guy who was the first lost that
Johnny Hendricks got.

122
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:03,910
People don't know Rick Story.
Rick Story's a tough dude and for you to

123
00:05:03,911 --> 00:05:07,150
tee off on him like this in this perfect
way,

124
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:12,240
not with big wound up fucking heavy 
shots like he throws with Rick.

125
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:16,930
Story likes to do as he pressures guys 
and he fucking digs in or I wound to the

126
00:05:16,931 --> 00:05:18,400
body,
takes you down,

127
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:20,050
beats you up.
He's got a tough,

128
00:05:20,051 --> 00:05:24,070
tough dude and what you did is you just 
use perfect technique.

129
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,960
That angle.
When you throw that left,

130
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:27,880
you throw the LE,
you throw the Left,

131
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:30,460
the Jab,
you throw the right hand to the body and

132
00:05:30,461 --> 00:05:32,660
then you take that watch this jab.
Well he,

133
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:36,070
he did.
Boom.

134
00:05:36,071 --> 00:05:37,400
That was all luck.
You would just,

135
00:05:37,401 --> 00:05:39,370
did you adjust it perfectly?
What?

136
00:05:39,371 --> 00:05:40,510
That left.
He tried to be nice.

137
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:43,150
He tried to be nice to put yourself look
good.

138
00:05:43,151 --> 00:05:43,984
It's a beautiful combination today.
That's a matrix shit and I feel like a 

139
00:05:47,201 --> 00:05:50,230
big part of that is you not depleting 
your body.

140
00:05:50,231 --> 00:05:51,064
Absolutely.
Another big part of his and one 70 

141
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:53,583
pounders don't think you can just come 
take my body shots anymore because I 

142
00:05:55,451 --> 00:05:57,260
don't,
I got a little more biscuit now.

143
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:01,603
Yeah,
right.

144
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:02,630
You don't,
you don't have to.

145
00:06:02,631 --> 00:06:03,920
We body.
Jesus.

146
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:04,843
What did you body feel like when you 
fought one 55 like when you compare 

147
00:06:07,941 --> 00:06:08,774
yourself to a normal training session,
like say you're several months in 

148
00:06:12,531 --> 00:06:13,364
between.
I'll walk around one s I used to walk 

149
00:06:15,801 --> 00:06:16,634
around bow one 74 right?
That was like my deep training camp and 

150
00:06:20,991 --> 00:06:21,824
I noticed when I started to cut,
I'd get down to one 68 one 70 but I had 

151
00:06:26,061 --> 00:06:28,340
nothing in the gas tank man.
I would always be like,

152
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:30,500
it would all mentor at that point,
you know?

153
00:06:30,501 --> 00:06:31,670
And I didn't have,
like,

154
00:06:31,671 --> 00:06:35,240
my body felt real thin and brittle and 
one 70 I feel good.

155
00:06:35,241 --> 00:06:36,680
I don't feel the,
I got the,

156
00:06:36,681 --> 00:06:38,510
I got the extra tank,
you know?

157
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:41,120
Yeah.
I don't feel like it's a big part of it.

158
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:42,170
Oh my God.
Is it?

159
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:43,460
It's a big part of it,
man.

160
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:53,090
Okay.
Okay.
