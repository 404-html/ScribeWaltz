1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,800
The dragon's mouth and this thing.
Five,

2
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:03,240
four,
three,

3
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:04,650
two,
one.

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:09,070
Yes.
And we're laughing.

5
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:09,550
Oh,
okay.

6
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:10,540
Gentlemen.
Hello.

7
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:12,400
Let's do have the ability to go live.
That's nice.

8
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:13,240
Oh yeah.
You guys have.

9
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:14,270
Fuck.
You will lose.

10
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,540
You get fucked by Mr Rogers.
Mr Rogers.

11
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:19,270
It's funny,
the Bob Ross Estate.

12
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:24,250
Mr. Over the age of 19 dream,
but this is what's confusing what most

13
00:00:24,251 --> 00:00:26,890
of what you guys do in terms of like the
Bob Ross thing in particular.

14
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:30,850
First of all that was,
that took a lot of balls because this is

15
00:00:30,851 --> 00:00:33,520
a.
You had Bob Ross Painting Muhammad,

16
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:36,710
which is a period blood.
The second one because they,

17
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:38,320
the buzzfeed women were doing the
painting.

18
00:00:38,321 --> 00:00:41,320
It was youtube actually after meeting
with Youtube.

19
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:43,620
Remember how you can top something
because we'll,

20
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:45,970
we'll pull this sucker right up to.
There you go.

21
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:48,910
It's almost like an additional seven and
our student,

22
00:00:48,911 --> 00:00:50,440
you know.
Um,

23
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:54,240
but yeah,
we were Bob Ross estate got after you.

24
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:55,150
But,
but that's parody.

25
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:58,840
How can they mock you or how can they
get you in trouble for mocking something

26
00:00:58,841 --> 00:01:00,520
or doing parent,
here's why.

27
00:01:00,521 --> 00:01:02,680
You have a system with youtube right
where they just strike,

28
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,500
they strike you and you lose your
privileges whether you win or not.

29
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:07,600
We've never lost.
So the Bob Ross,

30
00:01:07,601 --> 00:01:10,750
the state sent us a message right into a
thing like first off,

31
00:01:10,751 --> 00:01:11,740
have you no decency,
you know,

32
00:01:11,741 --> 00:01:13,680
this isn't in accordance with Islamic
law.

33
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,990
Laughing our asses off onto this lot
like you're supposed to be in accordance

34
00:01:16,991 --> 00:01:19,720
with Islamic law when I'm doing.
Because they thought that we didn't know

35
00:01:19,721 --> 00:01:20,411
that it was a fence.
Yeah,

36
00:01:20,411 --> 00:01:25,411
they thought we didn't know.
We stumbled across this and so then we

37
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:30,170
bonded to the lawyers as Bob Ross would
have on let's say,

38
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:32,590
welcome back to the joy of painting.
We're going to draw her lawyer friends

39
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:36,910
eating from a nice big pile of shit and
we painted them eating from a pile of

40
00:01:36,911 --> 00:01:40,480
corn infested shit and then at the end
of the video and it looks like they need

41
00:01:40,481 --> 00:01:43,390
a friend and put Muhammad right next to
them in the pile and it hangs above our

42
00:01:43,391 --> 00:01:45,130
bathroom and we never heard from them
again.

43
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:49,690
They sent a cease and desist and we,
we ran it past her lawyer.

44
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:50,900
Shocking me have killed.
Yeah.

45
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:53,580
So,
and now we have Mr Rogers now.

46
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:55,590
What is Mr Rogers mad about?
We did a parody.

47
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,800
We did a few parodies of uh,
you know,

48
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,830
won't you be my neighbor intros.
That was it like a year ago.

49
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:01,090
But again,
how,

50
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:03,790
how could someone put a strike on you
for a parody?

51
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:05,710
I mean,
I thought that is protected.

52
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:06,641
Well,
you know,

53
00:02:06,641 --> 00:02:08,830
you get to the realm of parody and
satire and it's.

54
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:10,450
But,
but even then it depends on who looks at

55
00:02:10,451 --> 00:02:11,500
it.
That's the problem with Youtube,

56
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,160
right?
Just someone.

57
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,050
Last time we got her privileges back,
this time we didn't like.

58
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:16,121
We were like,
listen,

59
00:02:16,121 --> 00:02:18,100
we've never lost a case.
We've countered filed.

60
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:20,320
We've always won.
This is clearly parody.

61
00:02:20,321 --> 00:02:25,120
The Mr Rogers was actually your brother.
You want to track each like their,

62
00:02:25,121 --> 00:02:26,650
their,
their logos there.

63
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,760
Nothing.
Nothing humps aboriginal.

64
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:29,680
Yeah.
No.

65
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,050
Here's what's fucked up.
You were telling me about a meeting that

66
00:02:32,051 --> 00:02:34,900
you guys had when you went to New York
for Youtube.

67
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:39,850
They were comparing like what?
What is demonetized and what's not

68
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:42,510
demonetized and they had something that
would,

69
00:02:42,511 --> 00:02:44,420
you just explained what happened?
We,

70
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:47,110
we don't exactly know because it's
boiler plate answers,

71
00:02:47,111 --> 00:02:49,120
right?
We get brought out a bunch of

72
00:02:49,121 --> 00:02:51,240
conservatives get brought up to New York
who like,

73
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:53,190
who is worthy with you?
We'll us,

74
00:02:53,191 --> 00:02:55,720
you know,
the daily wire people who were really

75
00:02:55,721 --> 00:02:57,720
cool.
You Know Ben Shapiro's guys forward

76
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:01,360
publishings and then a bunch of tanks
mostly and everyone sat there and played

77
00:03:01,361 --> 00:03:02,950
nice and they bring out this whole
spread.

78
00:03:02,951 --> 00:03:05,000
They bring into the Google offices,
give you,

79
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,900
give you a tour.
This is in New York.

80
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:09,530
Do they fly you out or they ask you to
fly in,

81
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:11,380
fly out the paper that pay for the whole
day.

82
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:13,060
They favor the whole thing but you up?
Yeah.

83
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:15,790
Goes this summer.
Was it summer

84
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:19,990
six monitor half Asian lawyer.
Bill came with us and they didn't know.

85
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:20,830
We just were like,
Nah,

86
00:03:20,831 --> 00:03:24,210
he's a producer.
He came out and read the sitting there

87
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:26,860
right next to it,
the whole thing voted number one lawyer

88
00:03:26,861 --> 00:03:29,080
in the state and a hilarious,
really funny guy.

89
00:03:29,081 --> 00:03:31,450
So we go out there and we're just
sitting there kind of listening and

90
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:34,180
they're just saying nothing.
And finally I said,

91
00:03:34,181 --> 00:03:35,500
well,
you know what's happening with

92
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:37,240
demonetization?
What's happening with.

93
00:03:37,241 --> 00:03:38,970
Obviously we're all conservatives here.
Everyone.

94
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:40,450
We've had our videos put in restricted
mode.

95
00:03:40,451 --> 00:03:42,670
What are the guidelines?
We don't know and they wouldn't.

96
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:44,170
They're like,
that's a very good question.

97
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,680
And they looked at the back because it
was later in the day elephant in the

98
00:03:47,681 --> 00:03:49,140
room as if it wasn't obvious.
That's why.

99
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:50,800
That's why everyone's there and that's
what happened.

100
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:52,560
That's was the period blood spirit.
They're like,

101
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:52,931
well,
you know,

102
00:03:52,931 --> 00:03:55,780
things that are hate speech,
things that could be offensive,

103
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:58,160
things like current events,
it can be controversial and so

104
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:59,530
everyone's sitting there.
Yeah,

105
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,990
but I just said where I said what about,
what about buzz?

106
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:04,830
People have been painting in period
blood and the trending feed painting in

107
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:08,590
last week and viscously chunky period
lead on the home feed that's on youtube

108
00:04:08,591 --> 00:04:09,191
training.
What about that?

109
00:04:09,191 --> 00:04:12,070
Is that considered like child friendly
and conservatives were.

110
00:04:12,071 --> 00:04:13,120
Then they're looking back.
I was like,

111
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:14,950
look,
we were ruining the movie.

112
00:04:14,951 --> 00:04:17,020
I'm saying like,
why are we here?

113
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:18,230
You know,
that's the problem.

114
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:22,390
People don't say anything.
Well that is a very valid discussion.

115
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:24,850
That's valid.
Like what if you can't have been.

116
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:28,240
If you can paint in period blood and I
don't think you should be restricted.

117
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:30,970
I think if you want a pain period blood
as long as I know what you're doing.

118
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,480
It says painting a period.
Well,

119
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,350
the title it was,
it was an adult.

120
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:36,610
Well,
I might actually watch it,

121
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:38,620
but here's the thing.
These women,

122
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:41,110
I might,
I might just for this to boldly channel,

123
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:44,380
but the porn is like,
hopefully I don't want to take that

124
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:46,060
right away from them,
but I just.

125
00:04:46,061 --> 00:04:48,220
I'm confused by what.
What is.

126
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:49,510
Okay,
what's not okay?

127
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:53,200
You can't.
They embolden the right.

128
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:55,210
If you silence them,
you embolden the left.

129
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:57,640
If you silence bold people,
when you say you,

130
00:04:57,650 --> 00:04:58,830
you give them power,
you,

131
00:04:58,831 --> 00:05:01,150
you,
you make the whole thing bigger than it

132
00:05:01,151 --> 00:05:03,610
has to be.
People are allowed to have differences

133
00:05:03,611 --> 00:05:05,830
of opinions and they're allowed to have
different ideologies,

134
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:11,070
but when you have a platform where you
radically restrict one ideology and you

135
00:05:11,531 --> 00:05:16,130
openly support another one,
you're picking aside what's kind of like

136
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:17,100
dinesh d'souza talks about.

137
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:19,900
It's not about the law is,
is is it applied equally?

138
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:22,300
Right.
Youtube doesn't even respect the laws.

139
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,430
Here's something can happen with
youtube.

140
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,310
Just to give an example,
people have to a lot.

141
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,310
I don't know this,
so there's no single party consent.

142
00:05:27,311 --> 00:05:30,520
State two party consent state.
California is one of the few states

143
00:05:30,521 --> 00:05:31,990
where you have both.
People have to know they're on camera.

144
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:34,810
Now.
Even sometimes in a two party consent

145
00:05:34,811 --> 00:05:36,490
state,
there's no reasonable expectation of

146
00:05:36,491 --> 00:05:38,110
privacy if you're at a public event,
right?

147
00:05:38,111 --> 00:05:39,490
If you're a public protest,
you can't say,

148
00:05:39,491 --> 00:05:40,840
hey,
you can't take my picture.

149
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:43,780
You're there publicly protesting.
So these are legal layers,

150
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:46,690
right?
We had someone in a single party consent

151
00:05:46,691 --> 00:05:50,980
state in Michigan on camera,
at a public protest sign,

152
00:05:50,981 --> 00:05:54,430
a release to give an interview and then
complained to Youtube and said,

153
00:05:54,431 --> 00:05:55,540
I don't want to be in that video.

154
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,710
It didn't matter that we presented the
law,

155
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:00,200
the paperwork to youtube.
It was taken out.

156
00:06:00,201 --> 00:06:02,390
We had to blur the face.
But did they look bad?

157
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,450
Was,
was it under false pretenses?

158
00:06:05,451 --> 00:06:07,850
Like did they think that you were doing
one thing and then you're really doing

159
00:06:07,851 --> 00:06:09,650
something else?
So the crazy thing is this actually was

160
00:06:09,651 --> 00:06:11,450
a guy who agreed with them almost
everything.

161
00:06:11,451 --> 00:06:12,820
Yeah.
He was talking about that last minute.

162
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,520
He was really pissed about,
well,

163
00:06:14,521 --> 00:06:16,520
you know what?
He probably just got a lot of feedback

164
00:06:16,521 --> 00:06:17,051
and was like,
well,

165
00:06:17,051 --> 00:06:18,800
this is freaking me out.
I want to get out of this.

166
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,150
Yeah.
But as a content creator,

167
00:06:20,151 --> 00:06:20,750
you can't be like,
well,

168
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:21,770
sorry,
I didn't like it.

169
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:22,940
We don't know.
I mean,

170
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:27,140
you can understand like his perspective,
like him trying to get it taken down.

171
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:30,170
If you're a general public person and
you don't know what the fuck you're

172
00:06:30,171 --> 00:06:31,500
doing,
you say something,

173
00:06:31,501 --> 00:06:33,590
you don't put it on him.
He realized later he was raped.

174
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:36,410
It was much later taken down.

175
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:39,380
Now,
um,

176
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:43,910
I feel like when you,
when you pointed out the whole period

177
00:06:43,911 --> 00:06:45,650
blood thing,
painting and period blood,

178
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:47,300
what?
Dead Silence.

179
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:49,800
No one said anything.
They didn't respond to you.

180
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:51,530
And then leaders.
That's a good question.

181
00:06:51,531 --> 00:06:53,930
We'll get to that later in the day.
So later in the day was when they came

182
00:06:53,931 --> 00:06:56,210
up with this next Gen news and we were
like,

183
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:59,310
it got to a point where I was hissing
ourselves.

184
00:06:59,311 --> 00:07:00,950
Explain this because you explained it to
me earlier.

185
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:02,220
The problem is right.
We have,

186
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:04,580
I have to be careful because otherwise
they'll take it out of context.

187
00:07:04,581 --> 00:07:06,170
So then this is the newest portion of
the day,

188
00:07:06,171 --> 00:07:08,910
this whole Youtube conference bringing
out conservatives and you know that the

189
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,210
salmon a plate,
which I don't think there's anything

190
00:07:11,211 --> 00:07:13,780
gross or he was eating pasted fish in
the car.

191
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:15,200
No way here.
It was quick and delicious.

192
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,830
So I think it was a next gen news for
evolution.

193
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:20,580
I always get it wrong or whatever.
I think it is,

194
00:07:20,581 --> 00:07:22,900
is the opposite side.
I think it's next year we'll go next to

195
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:24,230
the lawyers would completely advocate
against.

196
00:07:24,231 --> 00:07:25,880
We're doing,
we're giving such specificity.

197
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:29,600
So this is the exact channel.
It's like hip hop and sneakers,

198
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:32,960
sneaker hall with whatever the guy from
the show,

199
00:07:32,961 --> 00:07:34,400
blackish,
anthony,

200
00:07:34,401 --> 00:07:35,270
whatever.
That kind of stuff.

201
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:38,450
So it's a lot of hip hop news.
So they come out to teach us how to do

202
00:07:38,451 --> 00:07:40,510
news and they will sell before we show,
you know,

203
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:45,320
so and so from extend news,
the sizzle reel and every other word is

204
00:07:45,321 --> 00:07:48,290
the Edward m effort.
And you could see them looking back and

205
00:07:48,291 --> 00:07:51,410
they turn it down because it's the whole
channel is.

206
00:07:51,411 --> 00:07:52,310
They didn't screen that.
No,

207
00:07:52,311 --> 00:07:55,040
they didn't screen it and she comes out
and he's talking about news and how to

208
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:55,840
create content.

209
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,470
The Algorithm,
knowing your audience,

210
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:00,480
knowing your audience is the content
creators.

211
00:08:00,481 --> 00:08:02,990
She's like the founders of it,
I guess

212
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:07,160
complaining you're filming someone going
through sneakers.

213
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:08,170
I mean,
I don't want to content it is.

214
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:10,400
And then I just said,
yeah,

215
00:08:10,401 --> 00:08:12,650
you know,
at this point they've been saying we're

216
00:08:12,651 --> 00:08:14,810
going to get to news all day.
This is the first time someone's come

217
00:08:14,811 --> 00:08:15,670
out because.
Yeah,

218
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:16,990
question.
Um,

219
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:20,120
we just heard about the new guidelines
and now she wants to beat advertiser

220
00:08:20,121 --> 00:08:22,130
friendly.
It's supposed to be family friendly,

221
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:24,500
a consumer that you deal with hip hop
and a lot of pretty,

222
00:08:24,501 --> 00:08:26,330
pretty adult,
pretty profane content.

223
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:29,120
Have you been hit by at the time was
called the apocalypse.

224
00:08:29,121 --> 00:08:30,320
I said,
if you've been hit by this.

225
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:31,760
And she said,
no,

226
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:32,600
not at all.
I said,

227
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,610
okay,
no further questions that,

228
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:37,820
that's amazing.
So all of that stuff's fun.

229
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:38,960
It's fine.
It's just,

230
00:08:38,961 --> 00:08:41,120
it's about the wrong opinion.
That's really what it comes down.

231
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:44,630
But is it fine because they're black,
but she wasn't black.

232
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:46,220
She wasn't black.
She was a white girl.

233
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,410
I think she was black.
Really?

234
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:51,050
Yeah.
Well I don't see color.

235
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,720
Me saying that.
I'm Irish quarter.

236
00:08:53,721 --> 00:08:55,980
I've been talking about this like I more
Irish

237
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,750
than a lot of people that call
themselves black.

238
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:00,270
I'm one quarter Irish,
three quarters Italian,

239
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,640
but if you look at me,
I look mostly Italian,

240
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:05,820
but if I said I'm an Irish man,
people will be like,

241
00:09:05,821 --> 00:09:07,680
wait a minute.
Are you really?

242
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:09,420
She was like Abercrombie and Fitch.
Black.

243
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:11,760
Yeah,
black.

244
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,310
She's generically ethnic.
Okay.

245
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,760
Like if I were a guy,
you know,

246
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:18,090
he didn't have no problems with them
dating your daughter if you were kind of

247
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:20,680
a racist.
They knew that it was a pretty slide

248
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,000
intimidate everybody,
but if she went to like a really fucking

249
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:29,910
heavy duty hip hop place and start
throwing that word around,

250
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:31,320
they would look at it like,
Hey,

251
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:36,330
she even allowed to say that.
Can you go blurting out the n word when

252
00:09:36,331 --> 00:09:38,340
you that white?
I didn't know that she could do it with

253
00:09:38,341 --> 00:09:41,790
her sizzle reel.
Well that seems like a bit of a problem.

254
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:43,710
Right?
That's like one of those weird double

255
00:09:43,711 --> 00:09:47,650
standard rules in terms of like the
language,

256
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:51,780
like if you are in that community,
you're allowed to use what is otherwise

257
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:53,970
extremely offensive language.
Yeah,

258
00:09:53,971 --> 00:09:56,580
sure.
It's like you have to have a hood pass

259
00:09:56,581 --> 00:09:58,530
to use it,
but you like the Platinum version?

260
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:02,090
Yeah.
So really all the way to get a black

261
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:03,690
what?
Especially on Youtube.

262
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:06,630
I mean I'm not saying there's anything
wrong with using that language.

263
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:08,520
Well,
I had a conversation I told you about

264
00:10:08,521 --> 00:10:09,600
this,
that I had a conversation with this

265
00:10:09,601 --> 00:10:12,150
woman from Youtube and one of the things
that we were talking about was

266
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:17,430
demonetization and we were talking about
like why things get flagged and I was

267
00:10:17,431 --> 00:10:20,230
talking about a conversation that got
flagged on Jamie.

268
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:23,760
What is it called when someone
recommends something and they have it in

269
00:10:23,761 --> 00:10:26,640
their feed,
like their preferred playlist,

270
00:10:26,641 --> 00:10:29,010
like a regular person,
not a content creator,

271
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:31,230
but if they have it on,
on their,

272
00:10:31,231 --> 00:10:32,220
you know,
you could do that.

273
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:35,040
You can have it in your channel.
Like you could I think just like

274
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:36,760
suggested playlists.
It's their algorithms.

275
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:39,270
So what it's called you,
you would call it a but not their

276
00:10:39,271 --> 00:10:40,680
algorithms,
like you would pick it,

277
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:44,100
like say if I've watched one of your
video video on Bob Ross and I liked it,

278
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:45,450
what would it in your queue cut that
kind of.

279
00:10:45,451 --> 00:10:46,680
Is that what it is?
The q?

280
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:47,533
Yes.
Okay.

281
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,020
So this guy,
gosh,

282
00:10:49,021 --> 00:10:50,770
I feel like we're really stupid right
now.

283
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,440
Like none of us just got that one
simple.

284
00:10:52,441 --> 00:10:54,680
We're all on youtube too.
Stupid asses.

285
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:58,710
But um,
so this guy got flagged and it was just

286
00:10:58,711 --> 00:11:01,800
a conversation between Sam Harris and
some other guy.

287
00:11:01,801 --> 00:11:05,610
I forgot who he was,
was an intellectual and it was about

288
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:10,700
left wing culture and it was about
leftwing radical ideology and they were

289
00:11:11,401 --> 00:11:14,490
criticizing it and this,
this got his channel flagged.

290
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:16,890
And I was like,
well how is this possible?

291
00:11:16,891 --> 00:11:17,640
And she's like,
well,

292
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:21,180
he's advocating that people watch this
and it must promote hate speech.

293
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:23,370
I'm like,
I fucking guarantee you that doesn't

294
00:11:23,371 --> 00:11:25,920
promote hate speech.
Did you guys even watch it or does

295
00:11:25,921 --> 00:11:27,930
somebody else complained about it and
flag it?

296
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,010
And then I brought up Jordan Peterson.
And by the way,

297
00:11:30,011 --> 00:11:31,020
it was just here,
just left.

298
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:34,380
He's going to be on their show there
next week to Canada

299
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,930
and she said like,
he's a problem.

300
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:42,750
He's a bit of a problem.
He's a troublemaker.

301
00:11:42,751 --> 00:11:43,890
I'm like,
he's a troublemaker.

302
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:47,520
I go with because he has his own
opinions on things like what is going

303
00:11:47,521 --> 00:11:48,380
on?
Like what,

304
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:53,420
what are you guys promoting?
A very specific ideology and anyone who

305
00:11:53,621 --> 00:11:54,040
differs

306
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:57,610
from that is hate speech because we're
getting crazy.

307
00:11:57,611 --> 00:11:59,890
If that's the case,
I think a lot of them don't know.

308
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:00,641
Here it is.
Oh,

309
00:12:00,641 --> 00:12:01,160
is this it?
Yeah.

310
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,440
Douglas Murray Hill.
Look,

311
00:12:02,441 --> 00:12:04,870
I can see it over there now.
Community guideline strike for just

312
00:12:04,871 --> 00:12:08,020
listening to an honest intellectual
conversation between Sam Harris and

313
00:12:08,021 --> 00:12:09,730
Douglas Murray.
Who is the guy who got.

314
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,780
Who got it?
Dig it down.

315
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,330
Yeah.
The S,

316
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:17,380
p e t e R K CCX.
He's very bold.

317
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:21,280
Yeah.
So this is a community guideline strike

318
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:25,420
for come by the way I listened to that
conversation between Sam Harris and Doug

319
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:26,211
Murray.
Douglas,

320
00:12:26,211 --> 00:12:27,330
sorry Douglas.
Um,

321
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,750
there's nothing offensive about it.
It's just a,

322
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,150
they're discussing things.
Well,

323
00:12:31,151 --> 00:12:32,630
here's the thing is now we've scaled it
backwards.

324
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:36,310
There's nothing if even if there were
actual video,

325
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:40,480
what that is and find out what the title
of it is and if maybe there's some sort

326
00:12:40,481 --> 00:12:43,870
of a description.
Does it say what does it say?

327
00:12:43,871 --> 00:12:46,290
They're just as Sam Harrison Douglas
Murray.

328
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,730
Yeah.
I forget who Douglas Murray is,

329
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:50,920
but click on him.
See if you can click on him.

330
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:55,390
A strange,
strange death of your.

331
00:12:55,391 --> 00:12:57,340
Okay.
Ima Immigration Identity Islam.

332
00:12:57,370 --> 00:13:00,250
That's what it is.
So Douglas Murray is a.

333
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:05,280
He is critical of the open border policy
that you're seeing become very

334
00:13:05,921 --> 00:13:08,770
problematic in some parts of Europe and
by the way,

335
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,980
which is funny because Sam Harris is
against the wall against Donald Trump's

336
00:13:11,981 --> 00:13:13,570
wall,
so it's like that's just two people

337
00:13:13,571 --> 00:13:16,390
probably with differing opinions on that
issue to some degree.

338
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:18,580
Sam Harris is a pretty noted critic of
Islam,

339
00:13:18,581 --> 00:13:19,240
but I think.
No.

340
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,860
Yeah,
but I mean the immigration thing,

341
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:23,200
he's more.
He's more open borders in the states

342
00:13:23,201 --> 00:13:24,370
then a guy like that.
Yes.

343
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:25,330
Yeah.
Well,

344
00:13:25,331 --> 00:13:28,960
I think what he's essentially saying is
they're talking about the very real

345
00:13:28,961 --> 00:13:32,650
issues that they're dealing with in,
in Europe and youtube size.

346
00:13:32,651 --> 00:13:34,750
Yeah.
When we played a video the other day of

347
00:13:34,751 --> 00:13:39,160
Paris of some parts of Paris that
immigrants who have moved into and just

348
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,260
fucking completely wrecked.

349
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:44,020
I'm not anti immigration.
My grandparents were immigrants,

350
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:47,320
but I'm just saying that there's a real
issue and this guy,

351
00:13:47,321 --> 00:13:49,990
Douglas Murray was discussing this real
issue with Sam Harris.

352
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:53,770
That got flagged and it got labeled as
hate speech.

353
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:54,871
Like.
Well,

354
00:13:54,871 --> 00:13:57,100
I had a fucking crazy man.
It's weird.

355
00:13:57,101 --> 00:13:58,390
I had a friend,
Lee Dorn,

356
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,340
so he actually,
he graduated like a,

357
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:03,250
like a University of Michigan Law.
Really just brilliant,

358
00:14:03,251 --> 00:14:05,440
brilliant guy.
He's like a Shapiro Kinda guy and he was

359
00:14:05,441 --> 00:14:07,270
one of the early,
early youtubers,

360
00:14:07,271 --> 00:14:09,040
early adopters,
first other conservative on Youtube.

361
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:10,030
Very Analytical,
very,

362
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:11,110
very dry,
very smart.

363
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:14,200
And he did a video that was.
It was just called something like the

364
00:14:14,201 --> 00:14:17,710
Japanese were not the victims in World
War II and it was a video about the

365
00:14:17,711 --> 00:14:20,800
atrocities that the Japanese committed
against the Chinese.

366
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:22,820
That's all it was.
Like the rape of Nam King,

367
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:24,940
why would he didn't get yes,
but he didn't get super graphic,

368
00:14:24,941 --> 00:14:26,950
but he was basically talking about like,
people just look back and I look at

369
00:14:26,951 --> 00:14:28,450
Hiroshima,
but let's actually look at the

370
00:14:28,451 --> 00:14:31,210
aspirations of the Japanese empire
historical.

371
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:33,850
It was removed as hate speech and here's
the thing.

372
00:14:33,851 --> 00:14:36,640
He came to me and because we had those
contacts at Youtube,

373
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,920
we were.
They immediately apologize and fixed it,

374
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:41,770
but what worries me is what if you don't
have a million plus subscribers.

375
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:42,390
Right.
You know,

376
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:45,400
what if I weren't there for him and
that's the one thing that I always get

377
00:14:45,401 --> 00:14:48,010
worried about with comedy and with a lot
of entertainers is they,

378
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:50,220
they kinda pave a path and sometimes
these guys,

379
00:14:50,221 --> 00:14:52,000
I closed the door behind him like,

380
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:54,110
well it was okay for me to say it,
but now this is,

381
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,640
that's really,
I've learned better.

382
00:14:55,641 --> 00:14:57,770
We should say,
well hold on a second.

383
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,510
We're in the boat.
Were you were,

384
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,433
you know?
Yeah.

385
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:02,510
Well,
and there's a lot of famine thinking

386
00:15:02,511 --> 00:15:06,140
going on in that regard where people
automatically want to protect what they

387
00:15:06,141 --> 00:15:09,440
have and get nervous about it and they
forget what got them there in the first

388
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:13,280
place.
What makes any of us popular is the

389
00:15:13,281 --> 00:15:16,820
ability to express yourself online in a
way that resonates with other people

390
00:15:16,821 --> 00:15:19,040
that are listening now.
As soon as you restrict that,

391
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:20,510
as soon as you change that and say,
well,

392
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,160
you know,
I just want to do real good and I'm

393
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:24,740
making a lot of money now I'm going to
change who I am.

394
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:26,780
You're fucked.
You're fucked.

395
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,700
You're fucked.
I would take it a step further and say,

396
00:15:28,701 --> 00:15:30,950
authenticity and people like you because
you're authentic.

397
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:32,870
Yeah.
I think we're pretty authentic with what

398
00:15:32,871 --> 00:15:33,660
we do with the show.
I mean,

399
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:35,820
we're pretty straightforward.
Um,

400
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:38,090
people come up and they meet us at shows
and they're like,

401
00:15:38,091 --> 00:15:40,390
wow.
It feels like a right.

402
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:42,620
You can't,
you can't be authentic and play by

403
00:15:42,621 --> 00:15:44,930
youtubes rules unless you completely
agree with them.

404
00:15:44,931 --> 00:15:47,690
So it doesn't have to agree with them.
You have to be authentically willing to

405
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:50,780
abide by.
So that's the whole thing.

406
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:54,410
There's no authenticity.
It's like regardless of the rules that

407
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:57,260
they claim,
which are so ambiguous in practice,

408
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:59,390
there's no way to make it work.
Well,

409
00:15:59,391 --> 00:16:04,250
I think this is indicative of the
ideology that radiates throughout

410
00:16:04,251 --> 00:16:08,630
Silicon Valley,
which is radical left progressive,

411
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:13,720
Neil Marxist sort of ideology and
there's so much of that going on

412
00:16:13,731 --> 00:16:16,070
throughout silicon valley,
so much in the tech community.

413
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:19,340
So much uber progressive thinking,
which,

414
00:16:19,341 --> 00:16:19,971
you know,
look,

415
00:16:19,971 --> 00:16:22,400
I think all of it comes from the right
place.

416
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:25,100
I think they all want no racism,
you know,

417
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:28,250
they want no hate speech,
they all want wonderful things,

418
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:33,610
but you can't just decide arbitrarily
what is and isn't based on your

419
00:16:33,741 --> 00:16:34,680
perspective.
You,

420
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:36,890
you have to look at it,
you have to look at it,

421
00:16:36,891 --> 00:16:37,740
honestly.
Yeah.

422
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,320
You know,
I don't think they're doing that.

423
00:16:39,321 --> 00:16:40,850
I think when you look at that Douglas
Murray,

424
00:16:40,851 --> 00:16:42,520
Sam Harris thing,
and the guy getting,

425
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:45,200
getting a community strike for just
liking it.

426
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:47,490
I mean this is crazy.
This is the.

427
00:16:47,491 --> 00:16:50,540
They take an authoritarian approach to
solving the whole thing,

428
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:52,970
which and they refuse to accept the
results,

429
00:16:52,971 --> 00:16:57,971
which is the Donald Trump presidency and
they've created so in their defense.

430
00:16:58,191 --> 00:17:01,790
One of the things they did say to me
that the problem that you're dealing

431
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,910
with people,
the problem with they're dealing with is

432
00:17:04,911 --> 00:17:07,270
blunt tools.
They're saying these tools that D

433
00:17:07,271 --> 00:17:10,220
monetize things,
they're not good yet and she said within

434
00:17:10,221 --> 00:17:13,050
the next six to eight months,
they're going to get better bullshit

435
00:17:13,090 --> 00:17:13,820
working on them.

436
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:15,270
I don't know,
second,

437
00:17:15,271 --> 00:17:17,840
but let me look.
Let me just express her perspective.

438
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:22,340
She was saying that they have made
significant strides since they first

439
00:17:22,341 --> 00:17:24,440
started doing it and they're getting
better at it.

440
00:17:24,441 --> 00:17:27,530
They're getting better at isolating and
one of the things we discussed is those

441
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,440
fucking creepy cartoons,
you know,

442
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:31,820
I'm sure you've seen them as a child
molestation stuff.

443
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:32,330
Well,
the,

444
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:34,820
the violent stuff,
a lot of it like babies getting hit by

445
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,230
bottles.
Have you seen those?

446
00:17:36,231 --> 00:17:37,064
Yeah.
Those things.

447
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,320
I've watched good things.
You know,

448
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,140
we're talking about now that I'd never
seen it all.

449
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:43,011
Yeah.
Well,

450
00:17:43,011 --> 00:17:46,420
it's a weird thing where these things
get put on a kid's playlist,

451
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:49,290
you know,
it's like Mickey Mouse and Minnie miles

452
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:50,130
getting drunk

453
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:53,340
and then like someone throws a bottle up
in the air and it hits a baby in the

454
00:17:53,341 --> 00:17:56,730
head and there's blood everywhere and
these same patterns are repeated over

455
00:17:56,731 --> 00:17:58,620
and over again.
Hundreds of these videos,

456
00:17:58,621 --> 00:18:01,440
maybe thousands.
A lot of them have been removed from

457
00:18:01,441 --> 00:18:02,274
youtube.
Right?

458
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:05,340
They've been pretty proactive about
Clinton Tarantino making cartoons.

459
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:07,110
It's fucked up.
See if you can find them,

460
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:12,350
see what Eli Roth played on a founder,
weirder playlist of like this guy

461
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,410
dissecting candy and making weird voices
over it.

462
00:18:16,411 --> 00:18:18,570
And then there was a whole list of
videos that people are saying like,

463
00:18:18,571 --> 00:18:21,330
what the fuck is this channel?
What's going on here?

464
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,050
And it just got bigger and bigger and
bigger and I don't think anything's had.

465
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:28,110
It's just weird shit.
It's really different than youtube kids

466
00:18:28,111 --> 00:18:28,620
thing.
No,

467
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:30,990
no,
I think he's done with the kid thing

468
00:18:30,991 --> 00:18:34,290
though,
is more fucked up because it's always

469
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:35,340
the same pattern.

470
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:37,650
It's like these kids get together with
the parent,

471
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:41,220
the parents give the kids booze,
the kids get drunk,

472
00:18:41,221 --> 00:18:43,920
they throw bottles,
that baby gets hit in the head with a

473
00:18:43,921 --> 00:18:45,330
bottle.
There's blood everywhere.

474
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:47,940
It's like the same thing over and over
and over again.

475
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:51,930
There's been all these videos exposing
these videos like people that are

476
00:18:51,931 --> 00:18:54,060
analyzing and saying,
what the fuck is this?

477
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:57,090
And it seems to be foreign.
They seem to be done in other countries

478
00:18:57,091 --> 00:18:59,460
and essentially what they're doing is
they're tapping into this.

479
00:18:59,461 --> 00:19:01,380
They have a like a pattern that they
use.

480
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:06,500
They're tapping into whatever algorithm
that creates your coming up next.

481
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,890
These adjusted.
Yes.

482
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:11,730
So a little kid can be watching like a
real donald duck cartoon and then it

483
00:19:11,731 --> 00:19:13,780
leads into this.
Yeah.

484
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:15,610
I don't think that's what anyone's
really complaining about it.

485
00:19:15,611 --> 00:19:18,280
I think we can all find common ground,
like let's get rid of the Minnie mouse

486
00:19:18,281 --> 00:19:22,300
being raped on youtube,
but the problem is I understand her

487
00:19:22,301 --> 00:19:24,670
perspective and that's what they told us
to almost a year ago,

488
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:25,840
but I even asked them,
I said,

489
00:19:25,841 --> 00:19:26,674
hold on a second.

490
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:29,410
You just wind and Dynas and you showed
us your whole virtual reality set.

491
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:29,951
No.
Yeah,

492
00:19:29,951 --> 00:19:31,570
yeah.
What were the most advanced?

493
00:19:31,571 --> 00:19:32,800
No,
that's what youtube wants to be at the

494
00:19:32,801 --> 00:19:33,910
forefront of policy.
You know,

495
00:19:33,911 --> 00:19:35,950
they're really aggressively under this
net neutrality thing.

496
00:19:35,951 --> 00:19:39,230
Everything.
Google really big policy wonks.

497
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:42,360
Really big lobbyist if you look at them,
but they go so okay,

498
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:44,860
you're super advanced.
Most technologically advanced company in

499
00:19:44,861 --> 00:19:47,920
the world,
but our channels is a real life one.

500
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:50,740
That's kind of the same,
same kind of shit,

501
00:19:50,741 --> 00:19:53,680
but these aren't as offensive to me.
Is the cartoon ones.

502
00:19:53,681 --> 00:19:54,514
Okay.
This gets.

503
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:56,260
We're always taking a 15 minute weird
video.

504
00:19:56,261 --> 00:19:58,780
Just weird stuff happening.
Like kids are supposed to watch this.

505
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,850
They stumble across it because the
algorithm,

506
00:20:00,851 --> 00:20:02,530
you know,
if they're watching tune with spiderman

507
00:20:02,531 --> 00:20:03,700
in it,
this shows up next.

508
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:05,170
Oh,
does she get drunk and he raped her.

509
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,950
She's getting tied up a second ago.
That's a really shitty spiderman and I

510
00:20:08,951 --> 00:20:10,220
wouldn't be fooled.
Yes.

511
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,840
That wouldn't make it past our wardrobe
anyway.

512
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,610
Alright.
But the point is you can't claim to the

513
00:20:15,611 --> 00:20:20,030
most advanced tech company in the world.
And then in our channel you're,

514
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:22,810
you're,
you're getting ads for Muslim singles

515
00:20:22,811 --> 00:20:24,460
and gay cruises,
like I'm on a second.

516
00:20:24,461 --> 00:20:27,130
Your algorithm that's kind of figure out
it is pretty fun,

517
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:29,410
but we're not getting any money from
those ads.

518
00:20:29,411 --> 00:20:31,690
Like you can't find.
That means that if our videos are

519
00:20:31,691 --> 00:20:32,530
controversial,
right,

520
00:20:32,531 --> 00:20:34,000
or videos or not a violation of
guidelines,

521
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:37,070
there are sponsors out there.
And when we see with Walter,

522
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,740
you know,
firearm company came to sponsor,

523
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:42,130
they seek us out because it's worth
octupled to them because they want to

524
00:20:42,131 --> 00:20:44,050
reach our audience.
Whereas Youtube says,

525
00:20:44,051 --> 00:20:44,291
well,
no,

526
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:45,124
it's not advertiser friendly.
No,

527
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:45,430
no.

528
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:47,440
It's not advertiser friendly for the
people you on there.

529
00:20:47,441 --> 00:20:51,190
It's not gay cruise advertiser friendly.
But you're telling me you have the most

530
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:55,120
advanced algorithms in the world and
you're running ads for young Turks on my

531
00:20:55,121 --> 00:20:56,450
video.
Like I really?

532
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,513
Yeah,
I think so.

533
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:00,310
A bunch of leftist ads and you might do
that on purpose.

534
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:03,160
I will be hysterical.
Impression when you,

535
00:21:03,161 --> 00:21:06,880
when you went to that one conference and
you went as him,

536
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:08,320
he,
he just goes,

537
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:10,930
oh,
it's very disappointing.

538
00:21:10,931 --> 00:21:13,690
I would have thought that was hilarious.
I mean,

539
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:16,180
first of all it was disappointing.
There was only 20 people in there.

540
00:21:16,181 --> 00:21:18,280
I wouldn't even gone out and been like,
look,

541
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:21,790
let's take this to a smaller place
because if a video gets out of this,

542
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:25,980
this is fucking embarrassing.
Is 20 people in this one room and then

543
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:28,900
you walked in as him.
I didn't want to do it.

544
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:33,220
Like he had called me out and this,
we've had people even on this show,

545
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:34,750
of course you wanted to do it.
That's why,

546
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:36,230
you know,
he knows I didn't want to do it.

547
00:21:36,231 --> 00:21:37,810
And I was like,
but I feel like I have to because he

548
00:21:37,811 --> 00:21:39,790
called me out and I said I accept,
you know,

549
00:21:39,791 --> 00:21:40,624
basically like okay,
let's.

550
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,080
And then he called you out.
How so he was talking trash.

551
00:21:44,081 --> 00:21:46,030
I mean it oil,
community,

552
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:48,100
bullshit,
that whole thing.

553
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:48,941
So it's like,
okay.

554
00:21:48,941 --> 00:21:49,870
I responded,
I'm like,

555
00:21:49,871 --> 00:21:54,400
let's hash this out.
He will mention he will rebut every Tom,

556
00:21:54,401 --> 00:21:56,230
Dick and Harry on Youtube,
not named Steven crowder.

557
00:21:56,231 --> 00:21:58,490
So at this point I was just trying to
get an interview with him.

558
00:21:58,510 --> 00:22:00,040
We used to,
we've had people on our show we disagree

559
00:22:00,041 --> 00:22:01,630
with.
We do it an hour long.

560
00:22:01,631 --> 00:22:04,360
Change my mind where I sit down and
listen to someone scream at me.

561
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,610
I'm more than willing to video.
You did the.

562
00:22:06,611 --> 00:22:08,590
Were you drinking the bacon grease and
you did.

563
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:12,160
It was pretty him and funny.
Come on man.

564
00:22:12,161 --> 00:22:14,050
It's fucking funny.
It made me laugh,

565
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,460
but the point is he forced my hand,
right?

566
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,300
I had to do it like he.
It's like that guy in diners to punch

567
00:22:19,301 --> 00:22:22,250
all the people who ganged up on a
baseball diamond throughout the day.

568
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:22,871
I was like,
well no,

569
00:22:22,871 --> 00:22:25,360
I have to do this with Cenk because
there's no other recourse.

570
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:28,600
And he kept going to the audience that
the only reason we show the audience

571
00:22:28,601 --> 00:22:29,700
like youtube,
there's another recourse,

572
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:32,120
like you have to go to.
The Bain has to escalate.

573
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:33,070
He goes,
he goes,

574
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:37,450
listen to like you.
So it's like at this point you brought

575
00:22:37,451 --> 00:22:39,460
up the audience.
Let's do a pan.

576
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:40,870
You know,
there's 20 people,

577
00:22:40,871 --> 00:22:42,580
like I don't want to go up and embarrass
the guy,

578
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:45,640
but he's such,
just such an asshole.

579
00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:47,530
You know,
there's just no way around it,

580
00:22:47,531 --> 00:22:50,800
so we kind of retired.
That character to character is funny

581
00:22:50,801 --> 00:22:52,730
when you're drinking the bacon grease.
That's not true.

582
00:22:52,731 --> 00:22:54,520
We brought them back this week and I
know that's right.

583
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:57,310
I've had nothing but pleasant dealings
with Jank.

584
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:59,530
Nothing,
but I don't have any hate for the guy,

585
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:02,650
but I laughed because I run the
handshake with them.

586
00:23:02,651 --> 00:23:03,860
It was a wonderful moment.
Was it?

587
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:04,540
Yeah,
it was great.

588
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:05,373
Good.
Yeah.

589
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:09,820
I just think like most people,
they get embroiled in conflict and then

590
00:23:09,821 --> 00:23:13,390
they lose perspective and then it builds
up and then it becomes something stupid

591
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:16,900
and I think you know,
his thing with Alex Jones is handled

592
00:23:16,901 --> 00:23:19,840
very poorly and they start screaming at
each other and Anna called him a fat

593
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:21,430
fuck.
God Damn.

594
00:23:21,431 --> 00:23:23,970
You can't do that.
Just is against everything you guys

595
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:25,930
stand for.
You calling him a fat fuck.

596
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:28,320
You can't just shaved him.
Me.

597
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:31,120
Meanwhile jenks fatter.
This is fucking crazy.

598
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:32,530
Like,
what are you doing?

599
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:34,330
Yeah.
Which links put them on.

600
00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:36,670
That's A.
I don't think he realizes that yet.

601
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:38,290
I don't think he's at the point where he
realizes that he's,

602
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:39,340
you know,
he's bigger than Alex.

603
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:42,630
Oh really?
I don't think he's lying to himself.

604
00:23:42,631 --> 00:23:44,380
I know.
I don't want to speculate on how he

605
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,670
looks at herself in the mirror and what
he tells himself in the morning and get

606
00:23:46,671 --> 00:23:49,100
to the deck.
He said my dealings with Janka had been

607
00:23:49,101 --> 00:23:50,930
nothing but pleasant.
I like talking to him.

608
00:23:50,931 --> 00:23:52,640
I had him on the podcast.
I like talking to them.

609
00:23:52,641 --> 00:23:55,000
I just think people lose their place.
They lose their,

610
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:56,660
lose their,
their,

611
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,980
their view of the world.
Well,

612
00:23:57,981 --> 00:24:01,040
I think when your identity is entirely
tied up in the numbers,

613
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,540
right?
When it's entirely tied up,

614
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:04,910
his only defense was looking at the
audience.

615
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:05,900
It's like,
hold on a second that,

616
00:24:05,901 --> 00:24:07,460
that ebbs and flows.
I mean,

617
00:24:07,461 --> 00:24:07,880
you know,
even,

618
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:10,190
I mean you guys obviously have a crazy
successful show,

619
00:24:10,191 --> 00:24:12,350
but some shows are more popular than
others of course.

620
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:14,150
And for them they,
you know,

621
00:24:14,151 --> 00:24:18,710
this far left sort of I guess
progressive viewpoint and they've gotten

622
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:22,460
increasingly worse is not popular.
And when that's your only argument,

623
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:25,550
when that's your whole identity is a
very short time between that and when

624
00:24:25,551 --> 00:24:27,150
the pendulum swings and that even,
even the,

625
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:28,040
uh,
we need debate it.

626
00:24:28,041 --> 00:24:29,570
Ben,
Ben Shapiro.

627
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:31,880
Yeah.
That was the audience the year before

628
00:24:31,881 --> 00:24:34,200
was him and Dinesh D'souza.
You're welcome.

629
00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:38,240
And people were clapping for them.
And then when he was sitting there with

630
00:24:38,241 --> 00:24:39,200
Ben,
it didn't work.

631
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,430
Well,
the Da Dinesh one,

632
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:44,810
he had that ace in the hole.
Like that card,

633
00:24:44,811 --> 00:24:47,460
like you went to prison as a fucking
tough card to get by.

634
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:48,890
It's pretty funny.
It is funny.

635
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,610
It's funny to picture the national
prison I'm friends with,

636
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:55,250
you know.
Well I felt like the Sam Harris one was

637
00:24:55,251 --> 00:24:58,490
a big downfall for him.
Ben Affleck and all that stuff.

638
00:24:58,910 --> 00:25:01,370
Sam just handled it better.
You know,

639
00:25:01,371 --> 00:25:03,290
when they were in,
they had that long three hour

640
00:25:03,291 --> 00:25:06,020
conversation in a three hour
conversation with someone.

641
00:25:06,610 --> 00:25:08,630
You know,
it's hard to hide.

642
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:13,400
It's like your ideas get exposed,
your lack of knowledge gets exposed.

643
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:15,660
Well that's what the left doesn't do it.
And I know people say,

644
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:16,311
well,
okay,

645
00:25:16,311 --> 00:25:19,670
if we do a segment where the biggest
success for us this year that we're

646
00:25:19,671 --> 00:25:22,270
really grateful for is that changed my
mindset and that's just where I

647
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:25,480
literally sit down and we put up a booth
that says I'm pro gun changed my mind,

648
00:25:25,481 --> 00:25:27,260
or I'm prolife changed my mind,
or there are only two genders.

649
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:31,970
I'm pro gun change,
wildly unpopular here and go in the

650
00:25:31,971 --> 00:25:32,670
wrong spots.

651
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:35,630
I can tell you where to go.
And uh,

652
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:38,600
we had one that was like an hour long
thing on abortion.

653
00:25:38,601 --> 00:25:41,990
One that wasn't just at Smu,
five people just lined up and I just

654
00:25:41,991 --> 00:25:43,820
listened to them.
And out of the five people,

655
00:25:43,821 --> 00:25:46,610
two of them changed their mind.
And then some of them we didn't find

656
00:25:46,611 --> 00:25:47,870
com.
It's completely unedited.

657
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:49,640
And everyone,
when I worked at Fox News,

658
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:52,520
everyone in cable news would have told
you this would not work and no one's

659
00:25:52,521 --> 00:25:55,850
going to watch an hour long discussion.
But there's no one on the left who does

660
00:25:55,851 --> 00:25:56,451
that?
Well,

661
00:25:56,451 --> 00:26:00,260
they can't do it in their format.
They can't do it when they have an eight

662
00:26:00,261 --> 00:26:04,250
to 10 slot or an eight to nine slot and
there's every 15 minutes you have to

663
00:26:04,251 --> 00:26:06,890
champ sandwich and a commercial and then
you have all these segments that you

664
00:26:06,891 --> 00:26:08,390
have to play.
They can't do it,

665
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:10,820
but that's just because their format
sucks.

666
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,460
Like it's an art.
It's an antiquated form of

667
00:26:13,461 --> 00:26:15,170
entertainment.
It just doesn't work anymore.

668
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:17,360
But even the lifts on Youtube,
like the young Turks,

669
00:26:17,361 --> 00:26:20,050
they don't do that.
The unedited is long form thing because

670
00:26:20,051 --> 00:26:22,490
it shows are there on,
on Youtube.

671
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:25,340
What are they like really popular ones?
I don't know.

672
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:27,920
I don't know.
They're really Sam Cedar Show,

673
00:26:27,921 --> 00:26:29,720
right?
The majority report is.

674
00:26:29,721 --> 00:26:32,150
He used to fuck that up.
I called the minority report once.

675
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,040
That's easy to easy to do.
Yeah.

676
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:36,440
They think I did it on purpose or were
they mad?

677
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:40,220
They thought you were doing like the
conservative talk show thing where

678
00:26:40,221 --> 00:26:40,810
you're like,
Nah,

679
00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:43,890
that
Democrats don't do that.

680
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,440
I think they also call me right wing
too,

681
00:26:46,441 --> 00:26:47,274
which was like,
all right,

682
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:48,740
let's see.
Did you pick up the.

683
00:26:48,741 --> 00:26:53,160
One of the things they were saying was
that people just decide that these

684
00:26:53,161 --> 00:26:55,470
people that we decide to help each other
out,

685
00:26:55,471 --> 00:26:59,670
that the right supports themselves and
they support like other right wing

686
00:26:59,671 --> 00:27:01,260
people,
but the left needs to figure out how to

687
00:27:01,261 --> 00:27:02,094
do that.
I'm like,

688
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:03,930
I'll fucking have anybody on.
Yeah,

689
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:06,060
I have a left wing people on all the
time.

690
00:27:06,061 --> 00:27:08,400
I have libertarians and all this.
I have people that are completely

691
00:27:08,401 --> 00:27:12,200
neutral to politics on all the time.
I just think when you box yourself into

692
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:17,210
these ideologies when you're only pro
left and you can't see any perspective

693
00:27:17,611 --> 00:27:20,610
outside of that,
it becomes an issue,

694
00:27:20,611 --> 00:27:22,530
which is it's going to be an issue for
you today.

695
00:27:22,531 --> 00:27:24,540
After a double feature of Jordan
Peterson and us,

696
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:26,460
they're probably going to come fast.

697
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:28,410
Fuck,
I really don't.

698
00:27:28,411 --> 00:27:30,450
I mean,
Jordan Peterson Hall knew it when I was.

699
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,830
When I was doing this.
First of all,

700
00:27:31,831 --> 00:27:33,220
Jordan Peterson,
you know,

701
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:37,140
I'll have that guy on anytime.
He's one of my favorite people to talk

702
00:27:37,141 --> 00:27:38,310
to it.
Just a fascinating guy,

703
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,830
but I knew like having to back to back,
I was like,

704
00:27:40,831 --> 00:27:42,090
oh,
it's so fucking old road zone,

705
00:27:42,091 --> 00:27:44,970
which is just embracing it.
What are the notes,

706
00:27:44,971 --> 00:27:47,670
you know,
but you're definitely on the characters

707
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:50,160
that appear in the past.
It's of all the variables.

708
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:54,750
What I wanted to talk to you guys about
is some of my favorite stuff that you've

709
00:27:54,751 --> 00:27:58,770
done and some of my favorite stuff
you've done is the undercover shit and

710
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:02,420
one of the things that I've found the
most disturbing was when youtube posed

711
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:06,240
as a gay couple and you went to that
place where they were advocating

712
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:11,070
transgender children and transitioning
children as young as three years old.

713
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:12,330
Right?
Was.

714
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:13,800
I was three years old,
but puberty blockers.

715
00:28:13,801 --> 00:28:14,531
Yeah.
They were talking about.

716
00:28:14,531 --> 00:28:16,740
Yeah,
but I think it was really fucking.

717
00:28:16,741 --> 00:28:17,131
Yeah.
Oh No,

718
00:28:17,131 --> 00:28:17,910
no.
You know what?

719
00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:21,180
Actually three years old was Owen.
Benjamin got in an argument on twitter

720
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:26,360
and lost his manager because he was
saying that someone is fucking insane.

721
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:30,750
Forgiving puberty blockers to a three
year old kid for giving hormone blockers

722
00:28:30,751 --> 00:28:32,700
to a baby,
which I am.

723
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,250
Fuck yeah.
That's not even a strong enough word.

724
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,140
I mean,
it's insanity.

725
00:28:37,170 --> 00:28:40,530
Fucking insanity.
Meet your bodies aren't even developed.

726
00:28:40,531 --> 00:28:43,290
You're not even close.
We're not talking about 18.

727
00:28:43,410 --> 00:28:45,360
We're not even talking about 21,
which is arguable.

728
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:47,760
Still crazy.
Like you really try waiting to your

729
00:28:47,761 --> 00:28:50,370
fucking frontal cortex is fully
developed and figure out who you are.

730
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:52,860
But the idea that you're gonna know at
three,

731
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:54,330
who are you going to be when you're 30?

732
00:28:54,770 --> 00:28:55,820
Well,
they present the other side.

733
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:57,420
Banana.
They act as though you're crazy.

734
00:28:57,450 --> 00:28:58,081
That was it.
They were like,

735
00:28:58,081 --> 00:28:58,651
well,
you know,

736
00:28:58,651 --> 00:29:01,280
the thing is with the puberty.
Remember that person looked like me with

737
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:03,230
a look like from Hook.
Well let's play.

738
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:07,350
Let's play some of it because it's.
It's fucking nuts.

739
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,850
When I watched it,
I was like,

740
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,440
oh my God.
Like what are these people saying and

741
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:14,400
have been taken down since you asked me
about that to really?

742
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:15,870
Yeah.
We have to set the blurt the guy.

743
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:18,210
Well,
I'm not afraid who tickets.direct spot.

744
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:21,430
Dr Rex,
but who shows up and prizes name my name

745
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,230
is rigged,
but that his kid you not,

746
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:25,230
I kid you not.
We had a business card.

747
00:29:25,231 --> 00:29:27,460
Real world.
We're in a goddamn simulation.

748
00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:30,690
This was a town hall.
We're in a simulation.

749
00:29:30,691 --> 00:29:31,830
This can't be real.
A Guy,

750
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:33,240
his name is rex,
but.

751
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,940
And he got,
you know,

752
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:40,860
Youtube.
Okay,

753
00:29:40,861 --> 00:29:42,190
let's play some of this and

754
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:46,990
if there's a way for most of the people
are listening rather than watching.

755
00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:48,940
So you already know what's.
You gave him the.

756
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:50,770
No,
let's set this up.

757
00:29:50,771 --> 00:29:52,240
Intern.
So what was this?

758
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,620
Okay,
it was.

759
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:56,230
We'll knock a jared and here's one.
Let me,

760
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:58,440
can I preface this with something again?
We don't like.

761
00:29:58,450 --> 00:30:00,910
We're not undercover journalists.
We do a late night show.

762
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:02,400
That's what we do.
We do coffee to the Mandala.

763
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:05,920
Would you joke sketches and we do
interviews and then every now and then

764
00:30:05,921 --> 00:30:07,870
we stumble across something.
And when you're doing,

765
00:30:07,871 --> 00:30:09,730
for example,
like Antifa and they hand you a knife

766
00:30:09,731 --> 00:30:12,790
and they talk about shooting that too.
But the point is,

767
00:30:12,791 --> 00:30:14,890
and then when the media just lies about
it,

768
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:17,440
like we feel compelled to.
This isn't our thing.

769
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:19,570
This is one.
This particular one was kind of a

770
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:20,610
throwaway.
It was a throne.

771
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:21,970
We were joking.
It was a goof.

772
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,220
It wasn't even bothered with costumes.
If you just walked in separate queer,

773
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:25,360
it was what?
The health care.

774
00:30:25,361 --> 00:30:30,040
Transgender town hall where it's like,
oh my transgender town hall.

775
00:30:30,090 --> 00:30:31,330
Transgender.
Where was it at?

776
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:32,650
Vermont.
Vermont.

777
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:33,551
Burlington,
Vermont.

778
00:30:33,551 --> 00:30:34,630
Oh,
that place is crazy.

779
00:30:34,810 --> 00:30:39,150
I wasn't a plane with Bernie Sanders on
the way there to wow money.

780
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:41,610
I'm going to give it to the blacks.

781
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:48,210
Okay.
Right.

782
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:49,930
Let's,
let's play.

783
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:54,440
Has said

784
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:57,080
that feels like a girl playing with
dolls.

785
00:30:57,081 --> 00:30:58,520
And of course we don't want to
discourage it.

786
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,370
Um,
we spoke with our primary care

787
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,840
physician.
He said,

788
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:07,870
wait until the boys fully developed.
We made his own little thing.

789
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:10,910
That's me.
I would say a little inaccurate from the

790
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:14,930
research I've done.
The kid,

791
00:31:14,931 --> 00:31:16,080
18th,
two lists.

792
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,690
It was just like,
okay,

793
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:19,670
get rid of the pope.
Puberty blockers.

794
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:23,330
They just go through late puberty.
Say anything still lined up.

795
00:31:23,331 --> 00:31:25,360
There's no indication that there's any.
Damn.

796
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:29,480
That's not true at all.
Puberty blockers are not reversible.

797
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,250
That's the entire point.
That's not the point.

798
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:37,490
The young adult,
someone at the pre adolescent age going

799
00:31:37,970 --> 00:31:40,370
into those Adelaide.
It's going to change the way your body

800
00:31:40,371 --> 00:31:41,204
to Bella

801
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:42,220
at.
Yeah,

802
00:31:42,390 --> 00:31:45,390
I mean there's no way.
Giving a kid a puberty blocker,

803
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:48,810
letting them go through life with a
puberty blocker and then at 17 or

804
00:31:48,811 --> 00:31:50,880
whatever the fuck it is decided to take
that shit off.

805
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:52,350
You're going to be the exact same human
being.

806
00:31:52,351 --> 00:31:54,570
You would have been with the same people
worried about little estrogen and milk

807
00:31:54,571 --> 00:31:57,720
cartons.
So then this guy say free plastic,

808
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:59,280
because I don't want it to alter my
hormones by.

809
00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:02,100
I'm gonna chop off my balls and do
puberty blockers at eight,

810
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,450
but this is.
I mean,

811
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:06,930
you can't let a kid make those
decisions.

812
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:09,120
You can't make those decisions for a
kid.

813
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:10,590
They're too young to.
You.

814
00:32:10,591 --> 00:32:12,300
Remember he had a winner five minutes
ago.

815
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,310
I thinking about these things.
No,

816
00:32:14,930 --> 00:32:15,820
no,
he's fine.

817
00:32:15,870 --> 00:32:19,140
He knows his bugger off on the couch
three minutes ago and now you're letting

818
00:32:19,141 --> 00:32:21,840
them decide.
Is Hormonal profile the idea that a

819
00:32:21,841 --> 00:32:25,080
child who's six years old or whatever
would know the consequences,

820
00:32:25,081 --> 00:32:29,550
but them saying that 18 is too late and
that it's not that they would disagree

821
00:32:29,551 --> 00:32:33,330
with your primary care physician,
that it's too young based on the

822
00:32:33,331 --> 00:32:36,420
research that I've done.
What fucking research have you done?

823
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:39,890
What you.
You can clearly point that a good idea

824
00:32:39,891 --> 00:32:40,010
to

825
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:42,150
transition a six year old.
Well,

826
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:44,180
that's a problem.
Here's another problem.

827
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:47,590
We don't know if youtube is going to ban
this video because of what you just said

828
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:50,210
to you.
This video is going to get marked for

829
00:32:50,211 --> 00:32:51,260
demonetization.
Well,

830
00:32:51,261 --> 00:32:51,890
yeah.
The d,

831
00:32:51,890 --> 00:32:55,040
the Jordan Peterson one just got flagged
and we talked about this book.

832
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:59,930
We talked about the 12 rules for life
and talked about a guidelines for living

833
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:01,490
a hell.
Just started reading it.

834
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:03,590
That's great book.
Let's keep going.

835
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:04,453
Officers play

836
00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:09,690
more or less to understand themselves
and the task reads a particular length

837
00:33:10,571 --> 00:33:13,610
and the diameter and the penis is
developed enough.

838
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:14,950
Then there'll be enough.
If,

839
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,380
if.
If you're going to try,

840
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,190
you're going to transition to either
way.

841
00:33:20,090 --> 00:33:21,380
Oh,
because that's the problem.

842
00:33:21,381 --> 00:33:21,921
I was like,
you know,

843
00:33:21,921 --> 00:33:24,290
jazzy and no material of creative
vagina.

844
00:33:24,291 --> 00:33:27,080
If the testicles and the peanuts are
developed enough,

845
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:29,810
did you know this?
Did you know that unless your penis gets

846
00:33:29,811 --> 00:33:31,730
big enough,
you can't get a fake vagina cause

847
00:33:31,731 --> 00:33:34,610
there's not enough tissue to invert.
So he's like,

848
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,241
this is him.
He's like,

849
00:33:35,241 --> 00:33:37,010
now if you decide to transition the
other way,

850
00:33:37,011 --> 00:33:40,850
meaning if you decide to not transition
iep murder,

851
00:33:40,851 --> 00:33:44,150
how everyone made fun of this,
the beauty pageant girl when she was

852
00:33:44,151 --> 00:33:47,780
asked about gay marriage and gay
marriage or opposite marriage and

853
00:33:47,781 --> 00:33:49,520
everyone laughed and it was silly.
You know what I mean?

854
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:50,780
She was conservative.
It was silly,

855
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:53,780
but he's doing that right here.
Like should you choose to transition or

856
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:57,260
transition the other way?
You mean should you choose to not cut

857
00:33:57,261 --> 00:33:59,360
off your penis?
That's transition the other way.

858
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:00,410
Now,
not only that,

859
00:34:00,411 --> 00:34:02,780
there's a lot of people in the
transgender community think it's

860
00:34:02,781 --> 00:34:05,180
offensive to assume that you have to get
an operation,

861
00:34:05,181 --> 00:34:07,520
get your penis removed in order to be
transgender or Muslim.

862
00:34:07,521 --> 00:34:11,750
This guy's making this big assumption
that this is what you have to do in

863
00:34:11,751 --> 00:34:14,210
order to transition.
I know a lot of people that are

864
00:34:14,211 --> 00:34:16,850
transgender that do not have the
operation.

865
00:34:16,910 --> 00:34:20,900
I don't know a lot of people.
Let's just say I'm in a community focus

866
00:34:20,901 --> 00:34:23,880
group with transgender people.
By the way too.

867
00:34:23,930 --> 00:34:26,960
I'm 100 percent in favor of grown adults
deciding to transition.

868
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:28,910
I know.
I think you should be able to tattoo

869
00:34:28,911 --> 00:34:30,530
your face.
Get nose rings.

870
00:34:30,531 --> 00:34:32,570
I don't give a fuck what you do.
I really don't.

871
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:34,650
But you're also asking the government to
pay for your face tattoos.

872
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:35,540
Yes.
That's true.

873
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:38,090
Well,
and there was another thing.

874
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:40,400
I'm here.
I'll send this to Jamie.

875
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:44,950
That was some research today that,
uh,

876
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:48,020
someone put out here.
I'll play this and I'll forward this to

877
00:34:48,021 --> 00:34:49,490
Jamie.
I'll text this to keep playing.

878
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:51,120
That's it.
That's that clip.

879
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:52,423
I don't know,
but yeah,

880
00:34:52,450 --> 00:34:53,390
I mean that was.
The thing is,

881
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:57,470
that's a good example.
It's a public town hall which we attend

882
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:02,180
and it gets removed from youtube because
someone who handed us as business card

883
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:04,520
rex.
But this is serious by the way,

884
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:07,910
like we did the rest of us.
We weren't nearly as mad about this as

885
00:35:07,911 --> 00:35:09,960
we were just just,
just in,

886
00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:11,870
in doubled over in laughter.
The guy's name,

887
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:14,430
he had trouble getting less secure in
the url,

888
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:19,540
writes his own initiative to her website
url.

889
00:35:20,130 --> 00:35:21,680
I just sent this to you,
Jamie,

890
00:35:21,681 --> 00:35:26,120
if you follow the tweet,
it is a by Dr Deborah.

891
00:35:26,121 --> 00:35:27,730
So,
and uh,

892
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,600
it is um,
uh,

893
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:33,890
an article from the National Institute
of Health Study,

894
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:38,010
Dr. Zero van meter pediatric.

895
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:38,873
Oh,
okay.

896
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:41,220
Oh No.
Tuesday is your chronologists.

897
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:43,420
Well,
she's anti Aldis.

898
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:46,320
They don't give any leeway to Asians.
I get the minority group that they

899
00:35:46,321 --> 00:35:47,550
actually get more crap.
It's like,

900
00:35:47,551 --> 00:35:47,940
well,
you're up.

901
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:50,330
You have to be better than everyone to
get into a good college because have two

902
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:51,780
minutes to just so many really good
ones.

903
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:52,570
Yeah.
Okay.

904
00:35:52,570 --> 00:35:56,580
Dr q van meter,
a pediatric endocrinologist with

905
00:35:56,581 --> 00:35:58,620
extensive experience in gender
dysphoria,

906
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:03,330
which by the way is hate speech.
Says there is zero point zero evidence

907
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:07,950
that the concepts of gender fluidity and
gender identity have any scientific

908
00:36:07,951 --> 00:36:08,880
basis.
Yeah.

909
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:09,850
So,
um,

910
00:36:09,930 --> 00:36:12,630
this is why should include zero point
zero zero.

911
00:36:12,631 --> 00:36:16,640
That's the second zero.
She's money thinking about cash doesn't

912
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:19,290
mean anything.
Just thinking about cash money.

913
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:21,510
Well,
I guess you could have zero point zero.

914
00:36:21,511 --> 00:36:23,620
One percent.
You could have 100.

915
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:24,870
She wanted to make sure there's no
doubt.

916
00:36:25,010 --> 00:36:26,670
Yeah,
she started in those extra characters.

917
00:36:26,671 --> 00:36:29,160
We just got brown.
She's very,

918
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:32,610
the extra 2:40 characters.
I'm of those that you say like hate

919
00:36:32,611 --> 00:36:34,230
speech.
Gender dysphoria is still in the DSM

920
00:36:34,231 --> 00:36:35,710
five.
What does that,

921
00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:37,440
the actual,
like the psychiatric journal that they

922
00:36:37,441 --> 00:36:39,870
use a reference book.
But they literally call it hate speech

923
00:36:39,871 --> 00:36:40,291
now.
Yeah,

924
00:36:40,291 --> 00:36:42,540
I know,
but it's the actual medical condition.

925
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,250
What's crazy in that?
Undercover.

926
00:36:44,370 --> 00:36:46,050
God bless my wife.
She went with us because we need other

927
00:36:46,051 --> 00:36:50,460
people to have hidden cameras.
And so she posed as a lesbian movie kind

928
00:36:50,461 --> 00:36:51,001
of lesbian,
you're like,

929
00:36:51,001 --> 00:36:51,761
really?
You Exist?

930
00:36:51,761 --> 00:36:54,570
And like the full,
they couldn't say anything.

931
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:59,190
Well she remember said like I identify
as someone with bigger breasts and she

932
00:36:59,191 --> 00:37:01,590
was asking how to get this covered under
Medicare,

933
00:37:01,591 --> 00:37:04,310
medicaid because they were talking about
getting all these operations and Mr

934
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:06,000
Rick,
God bless them,

935
00:37:06,530 --> 00:37:08,960
but I think we should mention that,
you know,

936
00:37:08,970 --> 00:37:10,500
talk about that gender dysphoria.

937
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:14,220
So for her they use gender dysphoria to
try and file it medically to get new

938
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:17,970
tits on taxpayer dime,
but it's considered hate speech to say

939
00:37:17,971 --> 00:37:19,800
it to the tree,
the transgenders in the room.

940
00:37:19,830 --> 00:37:21,930
It's just crazy.
Like you can't make sense of it and I

941
00:37:21,931 --> 00:37:24,320
don't need to make sense of it.
I just need to not be banned for just

942
00:37:24,330 --> 00:37:25,650
wanting to be the woman she was meant to
be.

943
00:37:25,730 --> 00:37:26,440
Right.
Well,

944
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:28,800
I mean,
anything that you can mark is bullshit.

945
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:31,680
I mean if you could mock it that openly,
if that's not obvious,

946
00:37:31,681 --> 00:37:35,340
like getting,
getting bigger tits because you identify

947
00:37:35,341 --> 00:37:38,160
as someone with bigger tits.
I mean that's bullshit.

948
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:41,100
That's why it's so funny.
I don't think I've ever been in love

949
00:37:41,101 --> 00:37:42,620
with my wife that when she did that
shit,

950
00:37:42,950 --> 00:37:44,250
I wouldn't expect that she's looking at
me.

951
00:37:44,251 --> 00:37:48,000
She kind of nodded to someone who has
bigger breasts.

952
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:49,770
Well,
did you see that guy that got busted

953
00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:53,430
molesting children and said he
identifies as being a 60 year old boy?

954
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:55,890
That was a really recent case.
I mean,

955
00:37:55,891 --> 00:37:59,880
people are trying this out when they get
caught doing things and I'm not saying

956
00:37:59,881 --> 00:38:02,440
that there's not people out there that
identify with being a man when they're

957
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:04,950
actually a woman or vice versa.
That's not what I'm saying,

958
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:09,690
but what I'm saying is there's a lot of
fucking crazy people out there a lot and

959
00:38:09,691 --> 00:38:12,930
to deny that and just because it's
dealing with gender.

960
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:14,100
You're,
you're in.

961
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:16,770
We're in Narnia now.
We're in la La land here.

962
00:38:16,771 --> 00:38:17,430
When you're,
you're,

963
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:18,600
you're not being real.
No.

964
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:19,110
Well,
let me,

965
00:38:19,110 --> 00:38:20,460
let me ask you this,
because like you said,

966
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:22,560
you're not right wing.
I'm pretty open about the fact that I'm

967
00:38:22,561 --> 00:38:24,780
right wing.
I remember watching a show a while back

968
00:38:24,810 --> 00:38:29,810
and you had a little little guy,
little guy killed a buck.

969
00:38:30,001 --> 00:38:31,250
Buck and angel.
Yeah.

970
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,780
I'm a little guy that used to be a gal.
Yes.

971
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:34,590
Yeah,
exactly.

972
00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:35,950
And then,
I don't know what I said,

973
00:38:35,951 --> 00:38:36,040
but

974
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,360
at the same kind of conversation we have
here,

975
00:38:37,361 --> 00:38:38,520
like I don't just go and look at the
school,

976
00:38:38,521 --> 00:38:39,011
you,
you're training.

977
00:38:39,011 --> 00:38:39,510
I said,
well I don't know.

978
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:40,630
I just don't buy it.
And he,

979
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,790
he,
he wanted to get into a fight with me.

980
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,980
You wanted to have a fight.
Let's fight it out of this.

981
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:49,870
This was years ago when you got a fresh
shot of test jacked,

982
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:51,670
but you know,
like huge at one time.

983
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:52,810
Oh was he?
Oh yeah,

984
00:38:52,811 --> 00:38:57,220
it got up to like 185,
like super jacked because just banging

985
00:38:57,250 --> 00:39:01,450
test in there and fucking lifting.
But he was saying that his joints hurt

986
00:39:01,451 --> 00:39:04,330
really bad when he was doing that.
It's almost like it's unnatural.

987
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:07,570
So crazy.
But back then when you get them on

988
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:11,620
jacked jacked.
I had a role with that guy and be like,

989
00:39:11,621 --> 00:39:14,290
fuck it.
Go.

990
00:39:14,390 --> 00:39:14,951
No,
come on.

991
00:39:14,951 --> 00:39:16,630
You wouldn't have come on that to be
kind.

992
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:17,411
Yes,
yes,

993
00:39:17,411 --> 00:39:19,480
exactly what the point is back then.
Let me ask this.

994
00:39:19,481 --> 00:39:22,780
Did you realize it was gonna get as
insane or did he just think this is an

995
00:39:22,781 --> 00:39:23,800
interesting guest?
Well,

996
00:39:23,801 --> 00:39:25,630
he's a nice guy and you know,
I,

997
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:28,360
I'm more than willing to call them a man
and that was one of the things that I

998
00:39:28,361 --> 00:39:28,721
said.
I said,

999
00:39:28,721 --> 00:39:31,900
look man,
you're a person who would whatever your

1000
00:39:31,901 --> 00:39:35,080
name is,
buck or fred or Wilma,

1001
00:39:35,081 --> 00:39:38,020
I don't care.
Whatever you want to be called,

1002
00:39:38,021 --> 00:39:42,760
I'll call you whatever noise that you
connect with you as a being,

1003
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:46,630
I'm fine with that.
And if you can explain to me where you

1004
00:39:46,631 --> 00:39:49,550
feel happier being a man.
I'm 100 percent in support.

1005
00:39:49,551 --> 00:39:53,230
Are you doing that?
What drives me crazy is people making

1006
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:56,980
decisions for six year olds,
people pushing six year olds in certain

1007
00:39:56,981 --> 00:39:59,530
directions and I know that this does
happen.

1008
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:00,450
I know and I,
I,

1009
00:40:00,451 --> 00:40:03,190
I just can't get too personal about
this,

1010
00:40:03,370 --> 00:40:08,370
but I have a friend who has an ex wife
that turned his child into a girl.

1011
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:09,893
Yeah.
And,

1012
00:40:09,930 --> 00:40:14,930
and like tried this and was,
was pushing this and kids are very

1013
00:40:16,361 --> 00:40:18,400
fucking pliable man.
Oh yeah.

1014
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:20,020
This is not.
I mean,

1015
00:40:20,021 --> 00:40:23,770
maybe some boys would've rejected it and
maybe he was leaning that way anyway,

1016
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:26,410
but she was excited about it and this
is.

1017
00:40:26,411 --> 00:40:28,210
This is something that a lot of people
are excited.

1018
00:40:28,211 --> 00:40:29,800
I mean,
we're talking about a 14 year old.

1019
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:33,160
I mean,
I just don't think you know who the fuck

1020
00:40:33,161 --> 00:40:33,851
you are.
You know?

1021
00:40:33,851 --> 00:40:35,560
What is that girl's name?
Ruby rose.

1022
00:40:35,590 --> 00:40:38,410
Is that her name?
The attractive lesbian with the tattoos.

1023
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:43,570
She said that when she was young she
wanted to transition and she's very

1024
00:40:43,571 --> 00:40:45,940
happy that she didn't.
She wanted to become a man and she's

1025
00:40:45,941 --> 00:40:48,790
very happy that she didn't and she's a
lesbian and she's happy and she's open

1026
00:40:48,791 --> 00:40:52,540
and super successful,
but she's advocating the sort of the

1027
00:40:52,541 --> 00:40:53,410
same thing that I'm saying.

1028
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:57,760
It's like let people become a God damn
adult and then make these in in

1029
00:40:57,761 --> 00:41:01,300
alterable life changing decisions.
This guy saying that hormone blockers

1030
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:05,200
can be turned off and then you could go
through a normal puberty.

1031
00:41:05,201 --> 00:41:08,650
You're out of your fucking mind and I'm
not a doctor,

1032
00:41:08,651 --> 00:41:11,230
but I have enough understanding of
biology to know that.

1033
00:41:11,231 --> 00:41:13,210
That's crazy.
That's just not true.

1034
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:15,040
No,
it's absolutely not true and that's one

1035
00:41:15,041 --> 00:41:17,530
of those things you listen to.
Anyone can get lost in the weeds and

1036
00:41:17,531 --> 00:41:19,180
make someone look stupid.
Something specific,

1037
00:41:19,181 --> 00:41:20,160
you know,
whether it's.

1038
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:22,570
I mean you were showing me that compound
out there.

1039
00:41:22,571 --> 00:41:23,980
It's fascinating.
I don't know anything about it.

1040
00:41:24,010 --> 00:41:25,390
I'm going to be a moron,
you know,

1041
00:41:25,391 --> 00:41:28,450
less than room temperature Iq.
Some doctor can come in who's pro

1042
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,940
transgender and explain something and
make it sound like we don't know what

1043
00:41:30,941 --> 00:41:32,410
we're talking about.
So when it comes to that,

1044
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:34,010
I don't,
I don't agree with

1045
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:35,910
you there.
Well I don't agree with you on their

1046
00:41:35,970 --> 00:41:36,830
terms.
We wouldn't know.

1047
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:39,230
It doesn't matter.
What terms are there that you don't know

1048
00:41:39,231 --> 00:41:42,640
about a child's biological development?
Well they,

1049
00:41:42,650 --> 00:41:44,480
what they point to the.
Actually there are these studies that

1050
00:41:44,481 --> 00:41:45,130
show that the,
you know,

1051
00:41:45,130 --> 00:41:49,310
the brain alterations occur before,
across hormone replacement therapy and

1052
00:41:49,311 --> 00:41:50,121
it's actually,
it's not true.

1053
00:41:50,121 --> 00:41:52,040
So we have a few transgender people on
our show,

1054
00:41:52,190 --> 00:41:54,320
but the point is with these,
whether it's a conspiracy or,

1055
00:41:54,370 --> 00:41:55,041
or you say,
okay,

1056
00:41:55,041 --> 00:41:58,040
I'm not a doctor,
but I can't just appeal to authority.

1057
00:41:58,041 --> 00:42:02,030
I can't just say this doctor says x,
so I do have to at this point,

1058
00:42:02,031 --> 00:42:06,320
accepting that I'm not a doctor except
the preponderance of evidence from the

1059
00:42:06,321 --> 00:42:10,550
overall medical community and combine
that with the anecdotal and combined

1060
00:42:10,551 --> 00:42:12,200
that with,
is there a motive here?

1061
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:14,930
Is there an agenda here,
like a lot of conspiracy theories and

1062
00:42:14,950 --> 00:42:17,500
just doesn't add up because who benefits
from telling you,

1063
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,430
you know,
the world is flat.

1064
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:23,060
Who benefits from it?
Now I can understand how someone might

1065
00:42:23,061 --> 00:42:24,440
benefit from a conspiracy was like,
oh,

1066
00:42:24,441 --> 00:42:27,620
they make a lot of money off of this.
Or was it Tim Kennedy as a hunting

1067
00:42:27,621 --> 00:42:28,660
Hitler thing?
I'm not saying it,

1068
00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:29,271
but it's like,
okay,

1069
00:42:29,271 --> 00:42:30,670
I understand after war,
uh,

1070
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:33,350
they thought maybe they had Hitler and
they needed the healing for the country.

1071
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:34,820
Okay,
I can understand that.

1072
00:42:34,821 --> 00:42:35,970
But with this,
there's,

1073
00:42:36,030 --> 00:42:38,330
there's,
it just doesn't add up as to none of the

1074
00:42:38,331 --> 00:42:40,100
arguments.
They present that up from millennial

1075
00:42:40,101 --> 00:42:44,330
parents to whack off turning the age of
their children to social experiments.

1076
00:42:44,450 --> 00:42:48,080
It's disgusting.
That was Owen Benjamin's take Benjamin's

1077
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:50,690
take was that this guy in Hollywood,
I don't remember who it is,

1078
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:53,840
who's talking about transitioning his
three year old and he was like,

1079
00:42:53,841 --> 00:42:57,110
you're a fucking monster.
And he was getting in trouble for this.

1080
00:42:57,111 --> 00:43:00,500
He lost his manager show because he
writes for our show now we bring them in

1081
00:43:00,501 --> 00:43:02,420
on skype and we just sit and we kind of
brainstorm.

1082
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:05,150
And uh,
he wasn't really out of the closet.

1083
00:43:05,170 --> 00:43:06,500
I remember at that point and I said,
oh,

1084
00:43:06,501 --> 00:43:08,210
and I don't think you want this because
I had lost my manager.

1085
00:43:08,211 --> 00:43:09,830
And my agent was like,
I don't think you want this kind of

1086
00:43:09,831 --> 00:43:12,340
heat.
And the conservative,

1087
00:43:12,970 --> 00:43:15,880
the conservative and the industry,
it's a real thing that's hilarious.

1088
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:16,470
Like,
yeah man,

1089
00:43:16,470 --> 00:43:17,420
I think it's going to.
I'm like,

1090
00:43:17,421 --> 00:43:19,130
I don't think you want this kind of
heat.

1091
00:43:19,370 --> 00:43:22,830
And he talked about it on our show first
and it was almost like he was spit

1092
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:24,320
balling because.
Because then he tweeted something that

1093
00:43:24,321 --> 00:43:28,010
was really funny from the show and then
this just all hell broke loose.

1094
00:43:28,030 --> 00:43:30,200
And I was like,
I told you that's what was going to

1095
00:43:30,201 --> 00:43:32,900
happen.
And so now he's just full boar because

1096
00:43:32,901 --> 00:43:34,810
you can't,
you can't put that back in the bottle.

1097
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:36,950
And that's the crazy thing.

1098
00:43:36,950 --> 00:43:39,200
Like Owen was the quintessential
nonpolitical,

1099
00:43:39,201 --> 00:43:42,100
just sort of happy go lucky comedian.
It's totally changed.

1100
00:43:42,101 --> 00:43:47,090
And now if you see as act this,
and I know one kind of did that on this

1101
00:43:47,091 --> 00:43:47,840
show.
Yeah,

1102
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:49,570
I mean that's one of the things that
happen.

1103
00:43:49,571 --> 00:43:51,830
Like on this show,
we were just talking about all the

1104
00:43:51,860 --> 00:43:55,520
various things and also he was talking
about his dad being flamboyant and his

1105
00:43:55,521 --> 00:43:59,180
mom being kind of masculine and he grew
up in this weird environment and you

1106
00:43:59,181 --> 00:44:00,014
know,
he's just,

1107
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:02,390
he's a great guy.
I mean he's just,

1108
00:44:02,450 --> 00:44:04,010
this is his take on things,
you know?

1109
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:08,960
And He loves to talk shit on twitter.
He loves to stir things up and he does

1110
00:44:08,961 --> 00:44:10,100
it too much.
I told him,

1111
00:44:10,101 --> 00:44:12,880
I told him the exact you.
I was like,

1112
00:44:12,890 --> 00:44:14,590
oh,
and just take it down.

1113
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:17,420
Not Love you own.
Yeah,

1114
00:44:17,421 --> 00:44:17,890
I've,
I've,

1115
00:44:17,890 --> 00:44:19,670
I've,
I send them a text the other day.

1116
00:44:19,671 --> 00:44:20,660
I'm like,
you go,

1117
00:44:20,661 --> 00:44:22,700
first of all,
while your techs coming to me green,

1118
00:44:22,701 --> 00:44:24,020
I go to just flip to us.
Yeah.

1119
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:26,450
He got rid of the ego.
You addicted to your phone.

1120
00:44:26,451 --> 00:44:26,871
He goes,
yes.

1121
00:44:26,871 --> 00:44:27,704
I go,
dude,

1122
00:44:27,950 --> 00:44:29,470
like you're fucking crazy.
Like,

1123
00:44:29,471 --> 00:44:32,100
which is great.
Which most comedians in some

1124
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:33,300
way crazy,
but I'm like,

1125
00:44:33,301 --> 00:44:34,650
you know,
just you're tweeting too much.

1126
00:44:34,651 --> 00:44:35,221
It's like,
you're right.

1127
00:44:35,221 --> 00:44:37,740
I got to walk away from it.
To me,

1128
00:44:37,741 --> 00:44:39,700
this whole thing about your transgender
ism or something,

1129
00:44:39,701 --> 00:44:41,420
it'll be tweeted out,
I guess reality from the left and

1130
00:44:41,421 --> 00:44:44,640
progress and then I'll respond and then
I don't hear anything back and be like,

1131
00:44:44,850 --> 00:44:46,980
oh sorry.
I was out chopping trees.

1132
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:52,350
His brother's an arborist and he helps
his brother.

1133
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:57,210
It means literally
fucking 20 feet up with the ropes and

1134
00:44:57,211 --> 00:44:59,310
shit.
He shifted me Maple Syrup for Christmas.

1135
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:03,420
I believe we're is a great guy.
The promise with Owen and when we get

1136
00:45:03,421 --> 00:45:04,350
into the same room,
jared,

1137
00:45:04,470 --> 00:45:08,960
someone else has to manage us because
I love him and I,

1138
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:11,430
I just hate that happened to them too.
We were,

1139
00:45:11,630 --> 00:45:16,350
you want to have that conversation it.
I just feel that he needs to do is do a

1140
00:45:16,351 --> 00:45:19,200
podcast and get his,
you know,

1141
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:23,160
just get his stuff out there more and
he'll find his own audience.

1142
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:25,470
He doesn't need all this other shit.
You know,

1143
00:45:25,471 --> 00:45:27,360
there's a,
there's an illusion in Hollywood that

1144
00:45:27,361 --> 00:45:32,040
you need to be cast and things you need
to be cast a bowl and this castable

1145
00:45:32,041 --> 00:45:32,910
thing,
and I've said this,

1146
00:45:33,570 --> 00:45:38,250
one of the reasons why I have no actor
friends is because I have a couple that

1147
00:45:38,251 --> 00:45:40,920
I'm friendly with,
but as my inner circle of people I hang

1148
00:45:40,921 --> 00:45:44,160
around with on a regular basis.
Comics and fighters,

1149
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:49,440
just people that I deal in reality.
The actors are always trying to get cast

1150
00:45:50,101 --> 00:45:53,130
in things and there's a dynamic that
occurs when you're always trying to get

1151
00:45:53,131 --> 00:45:55,980
cast in things where you never want to
say anything that's controversial.

1152
00:45:56,130 --> 00:46:00,420
You don't want to have any opinions that
don't fit into the standard acceptable,

1153
00:46:00,421 --> 00:46:03,990
digestible Hollywood dogma,
whatever it is.

1154
00:46:03,991 --> 00:46:07,350
And it's always left wing.
Like what happened with Tim Allen?

1155
00:46:07,620 --> 00:46:10,250
He came out as right wing and they
canceled his fucking shit.

1156
00:46:10,570 --> 00:46:12,390
Like,
fuck you and fuck your show.

1157
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:15,320
He was a John case at guy do.
You don't have to be outright.

1158
00:46:15,321 --> 00:46:16,520
John Casick.
Yeah.

1159
00:46:16,710 --> 00:46:21,710
As big of a pussy as as the Republican
Party as a moderate Republican,

1160
00:46:21,781 --> 00:46:23,820
but still right wing enough where
they're like,

1161
00:46:23,821 --> 00:46:27,750
fuck you to wiener saying you just like
to touch a little boy.

1162
00:46:27,751 --> 00:46:30,260
It's like it just ruins your career.
It's disappointing and you would fix it.

1163
00:46:30,570 --> 00:46:32,790
Maybe you'd like a video of that.
It shows up on your feet.

1164
00:46:33,030 --> 00:46:34,710
What are you talking about?
House of cards.

1165
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:37,290
Kevin Spacey was never crazy.
Awesome.

1166
00:46:37,540 --> 00:46:41,280
So he's a different animal.
That's a different animal.

1167
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:43,530
I guess I didn't.
I never met him,

1168
00:46:43,531 --> 00:46:47,040
but I guess that has been saying about
him for ever.

1169
00:46:47,130 --> 00:46:48,180
Yeah,
but here's the thing.

1170
00:46:48,181 --> 00:46:50,370
This is like what Milo talked about.
Okay.

1171
00:46:50,371 --> 00:46:52,770
And this is.
This is all very taboo stuff,

1172
00:46:52,771 --> 00:46:57,570
but in the gay community it's far more
acceptable for a man to be dating a 15,

1173
00:46:57,571 --> 00:47:00,510
16,
17 year old boy that's openly gay,

1174
00:47:00,550 --> 00:47:00,810
right.

1175
00:47:00,810 --> 00:47:03,750
Than it is in the straight community.
If the straight community have you find

1176
00:47:03,751 --> 00:47:08,100
out that a 40 year old man is dating a
14 year old girl,

1177
00:47:08,101 --> 00:47:10,620
that guy is,
that guy's a piece of shit and he should

1178
00:47:10,621 --> 00:47:14,670
be locked in a fucking cage,
but if you find out that in the gay

1179
00:47:14,671 --> 00:47:15,960
community it's,
it's,

1180
00:47:16,530 --> 00:47:20,360
it's different strokes for different
smells.

1181
00:47:20,740 --> 00:47:24,020
I mean I can name you several people and
we worked in Canadian TV particular like

1182
00:47:24,021 --> 00:47:25,120
makeup artists who were like,
no,

1183
00:47:25,121 --> 00:47:25,900
no,
the capable.

1184
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:28,890
Michelle likes them young.
It was a common thing.

1185
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:32,050
I am not at all saying that it's
acceptable.

1186
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:32,760
No,
Kevin Spacey,

1187
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:36,460
but what I am saying is what bothers me
the same with the me too campaign like

1188
00:47:36,461 --> 00:47:38,320
Meryl Streep coming out,
everyone coming up with the Harvey

1189
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:39,190
Weinstein,
the germ right.

1190
00:47:39,191 --> 00:47:40,810
We all a piece of crap,
get it.

1191
00:47:40,811 --> 00:47:44,440
We all know that,
but not one person.

1192
00:47:44,730 --> 00:47:45,431
Okay.
They all Kinda like,

1193
00:47:45,431 --> 00:47:46,600
yeah.
He tried to do that with me too.

1194
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:48,850
Not One person came out and said,
yeah,

1195
00:47:48,851 --> 00:47:50,410
I got three Oscars.
I did it,

1196
00:47:50,411 --> 00:47:51,640
bitch.
No one.

1197
00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:54,760
No one admitted.
No one just like no one else is saying.

1198
00:47:54,790 --> 00:47:55,623
Yeah,
you know,

1199
00:47:55,740 --> 00:47:57,400
it's well known secret.
This happens a lot in Hollywood.

1200
00:47:57,401 --> 00:48:00,070
There are a lot of guys with young 15
year old boys.

1201
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:01,330
It's super common.
You go to the,

1202
00:48:01,510 --> 00:48:03,430
you go to the right bar.
Evangelists.

1203
00:48:03,550 --> 00:48:05,540
Well the Bryan singer thing,
right?

1204
00:48:05,590 --> 00:48:06,760
Right.
Bryan singer,

1205
00:48:06,761 --> 00:48:09,970
there's photos of his party.
There's a pool filled with boys like

1206
00:48:09,971 --> 00:48:11,560
literally,
and what's fucked up about is there's

1207
00:48:11,561 --> 00:48:14,890
red lights in the pool and we had a
field day with it.

1208
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:18,370
You could,
you could imagine where we imagined the

1209
00:48:18,371 --> 00:48:23,371
blood came from,
but there's literally a red pool filled

1210
00:48:23,501 --> 00:48:25,780
with young hairless boys.
They weren't hiding it.

1211
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:26,740
No.
That's the thing.

1212
00:48:26,810 --> 00:48:29,110
They didn't have to know.
Fully accepted.

1213
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:31,310
That's why the fake outrage bothers me.
I'm not.

1214
00:48:31,590 --> 00:48:34,050
It's a fake outrage,
I think.

1215
00:48:35,260 --> 00:48:36,970
Yes,
from the left and Hollywood,

1216
00:48:36,971 --> 00:48:40,330
not America.
America is outraged that Kevin Spacey

1217
00:48:40,330 --> 00:48:41,250
Shipping Fourteen Year Old Boys.
Well,

1218
00:48:41,260 --> 00:48:45,280
I think it wasn't just that.
I think what really got Kevin in trouble

1219
00:48:45,281 --> 00:48:48,490
was not just the initial story,
but then that he was grabbing dicks on

1220
00:48:48,491 --> 00:48:50,980
the set and he was just.
He would get,

1221
00:48:51,010 --> 00:48:52,540
there's the,
there's the red pool.

1222
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:53,560
I mean,
come on son.

1223
00:48:53,650 --> 00:48:56,260
Oh Geez.
I mean if that was a bunch of gals and

1224
00:48:56,261 --> 00:49:00,940
you were just excellent,
that'd be a boldly painting video for

1225
00:49:00,941 --> 00:49:02,260
Youtube.
This is all wolverines.

1226
00:49:02,261 --> 00:49:03,094
Next victim.

1227
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:08,530
Let's see what you guys look like.
It was the casting party for the first

1228
00:49:08,531 --> 00:49:10,640
class,
but um,

1229
00:49:11,020 --> 00:49:13,480
what Milo was saying when he was on the
podcast,

1230
00:49:13,481 --> 00:49:16,780
which ultimately got him in a lot of
trouble and lost his.

1231
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:20,320
And then also he's saying it on that
other podcast that he did with the,

1232
00:49:20,860 --> 00:49:22,600
uh,
the amazing atheist.

1233
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:24,340
I forget what,
what do they call their podcast?

1234
00:49:24,341 --> 00:49:25,300
You know,
the podcast.

1235
00:49:25,570 --> 00:49:29,200
I just know he got in trouble.
It's scoundrels or something,

1236
00:49:29,250 --> 00:49:30,083
something,
something like that.

1237
00:49:30,580 --> 00:49:32,020
Jamie will find him when he comes back
from the.

1238
00:49:32,170 --> 00:49:33,820
He's going,
he just bolted to the bathroom.

1239
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:38,140
But what he was saying essentially was
that when you're a young boy and you're

1240
00:49:38,141 --> 00:49:40,450
gay,
you can have a very positive

1241
00:49:40,451 --> 00:49:44,380
relationship with an older man who acts
as a mentor and that was extremely

1242
00:49:44,381 --> 00:49:46,600
controversial and then ultimately cost
him.

1243
00:49:46,810 --> 00:49:50,710
And he was also saying that he had that
done to him on my podcast.

1244
00:49:50,710 --> 00:49:52,030
That's what he said,
that he was young.

1245
00:49:52,031 --> 00:49:53,380
He was molested,
but he said,

1246
00:49:53,410 --> 00:49:54,191
he goes,
please.

1247
00:49:54,191 --> 00:49:55,210
He goes,
I was a predator,

1248
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:57,010
believe me.
I was the predatory.

1249
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:57,511
Well,
hey,

1250
00:49:57,511 --> 00:49:58,630
you know,
what is the difference if someone

1251
00:49:58,631 --> 00:50:00,100
doesn't understand it,
they don't know where that line is.

1252
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:00,910
What I mean,
like,

1253
00:50:00,910 --> 00:50:01,743
you know,
that if you were,

1254
00:50:01,750 --> 00:50:03,940
if you try working that out in the club,
and I believe me,

1255
00:50:03,941 --> 00:50:06,610
I was a Predator of the crowd,
is gonna go from laughing to uh,

1256
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:07,440
what you have.
Oh,

1257
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:08,370
that's the line.
Nice.

1258
00:50:08,420 --> 00:50:10,330
Caleb back.
But he's 14,

1259
00:50:10,750 --> 00:50:13,810
right?
If you're 14 and you're saying that you

1260
00:50:13,811 --> 00:50:16,240
were the Predator and you're the guy on
stage,

1261
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:19,000
you're not,
you're not the man who's talking about a

1262
00:50:19,001 --> 00:50:22,660
14 year old boy that you want to fuck.
You're talking about you being 14 and

1263
00:50:22,661 --> 00:50:26,430
loving the fact that a priest molested
you and that you went after him.

1264
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:27,910
I was a,
you know,

1265
00:50:27,911 --> 00:50:28,110
when

1266
00:50:28,110 --> 00:50:29,680
he,
when he was saying that it was down to

1267
00:50:29,681 --> 00:50:30,560
the.
It's very off putting.

1268
00:50:33,110 --> 00:50:34,970
She's beautiful.
She's wise.

1269
00:50:35,450 --> 00:50:40,450
She's an amazing smile.
What what he does is a lot of it is

1270
00:50:40,461 --> 00:50:44,750
stick and like it's sort of like a Gonzo
journalism type thing,

1271
00:50:44,751 --> 00:50:45,830
right?
Like you don't know when.

1272
00:50:46,010 --> 00:50:48,830
Where's the stick,
where's your real feelings on these

1273
00:50:48,831 --> 00:50:51,230
things,
and then where is the distinction

1274
00:50:51,231 --> 00:50:56,231
between how some heterosexual people
look at this and some gay people look at

1275
00:50:57,231 --> 00:50:59,810
this because I think that the spectrum
is different.

1276
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:04,100
Like the spectrum of heterosexual people
to think it's acceptable for ground man

1277
00:51:04,101 --> 00:51:07,730
to have sex with a 14 year old is a
fucking very small,

1278
00:51:07,850 --> 00:51:10,960
like insanely small backwoods.
You know,

1279
00:51:10,970 --> 00:51:13,220
there's no straight nambla with
political clout.

1280
00:51:13,670 --> 00:51:14,960
Exactly.
Exactly.

1281
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:16,520
You know,
there's no,

1282
00:51:16,550 --> 00:51:20,060
no one has a nambla bumper sticker,
but for isn't real anymore is it stays

1283
00:51:20,070 --> 00:51:20,590
real thing.

1284
00:51:20,590 --> 00:51:22,370
Fuck.
Someone tried to say,

1285
00:51:22,371 --> 00:51:23,990
uh,
I was a member of nambla one point in

1286
00:51:23,991 --> 00:51:25,160
youtube and suggested feet and I was
like,

1287
00:51:25,310 --> 00:51:25,900
okay,
all right.

1288
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:29,380
I don't think that one's going to stick
something in,

1289
00:51:29,381 --> 00:51:32,670
scale it back now it is.
Now they're going to remember let told

1290
00:51:32,810 --> 00:51:34,850
thing we got to him.
That was the one

1291
00:51:36,410 --> 00:51:38,350
who does that,
don't you know?

1292
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:39,550
That's j Hova.
That's cheesy.

1293
00:51:40,060 --> 00:51:40,761
Yeah.
Illuminati.

1294
00:51:40,761 --> 00:51:42,290
We meet on Tuesdays.
Oh,

1295
00:51:42,291 --> 00:51:44,620
Illuminati.
I always forget every now and he's.

1296
00:51:44,980 --> 00:51:46,040
He's an Illuminati.
I heard.

1297
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:46,933
Yeah.
Yeah.

1298
00:51:47,350 --> 00:51:50,880
Ireland let them in every Tuesday.
Yeah.

1299
00:51:50,930 --> 00:51:53,360
Elon musk meet somebody else to show up.
Secret.

1300
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:55,513
Yeah.
It is a.

1301
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:56,870
here's one thing I will say,
so like,

1302
00:51:56,920 --> 00:51:58,660
this is why.
This is why people say you're right

1303
00:51:58,661 --> 00:51:59,420
wing.
Okay.

1304
00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:02,180
Mrs. I'm not saying you are so.
Let me preface it by the reason they

1305
00:52:02,181 --> 00:52:02,870
are.
No.

1306
00:52:02,870 --> 00:52:05,720
There is no leftist show after you said
which left the shows.

1307
00:52:05,870 --> 00:52:07,490
They're not having this discussion.
It doesn't exist.

1308
00:52:07,530 --> 00:52:10,010
If it doesn't,
there is the wild progressive left and

1309
00:52:10,011 --> 00:52:13,940
the people who get in line there is not
enough of a contingency today.

1310
00:52:14,180 --> 00:52:17,930
Put it this way,
James Demore a let go for what he wrote

1311
00:52:18,020 --> 00:52:20,780
on Google.
Not a single person we asked at the

1312
00:52:20,781 --> 00:52:24,290
Youtube conference had ever owned a gun
or knew someone who owned a gun.

1313
00:52:24,620 --> 00:52:25,730
Youtube,
Google,

1314
00:52:25,731 --> 00:52:26,900
facebook,
NBC,

1315
00:52:26,901 --> 00:52:27,890
ABC,
CNN,

1316
00:52:27,891 --> 00:52:29,180
CBS,
all of them.

1317
00:52:29,450 --> 00:52:33,080
None of them are standing up and having
this conversation saying even the highly

1318
00:52:33,081 --> 00:52:36,830
controversial issue of puberty blockers
with with which most people disagree,

1319
00:52:36,860 --> 00:52:39,350
they just go puberty blockers,
a new topic of discussion.

1320
00:52:39,351 --> 00:52:41,450
They go,
the left cannot not have this

1321
00:52:41,451 --> 00:52:44,630
conversation because you have to draw
the line before puberty blockers.

1322
00:52:44,750 --> 00:52:47,720
You have to draw the line at how far do
we have to play along with your

1323
00:52:47,721 --> 00:52:48,360
delusion.

1324
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:50,950
It doesn't mean I don't like buck angel
doesn't mean we don't have Blair white

1325
00:52:50,951 --> 00:52:53,480
and our Youtube Carol video and are very
nice with her.

1326
00:52:53,570 --> 00:52:55,820
Was very against sexual puberty
blockers.

1327
00:52:55,850 --> 00:52:58,340
Yeah,
very against them and also on on

1328
00:52:58,460 --> 00:53:01,250
transformed and the nether regions.
Blair white.

1329
00:53:01,340 --> 00:53:02,510
Yeah.
See,

1330
00:53:02,511 --> 00:53:05,120
that's what we were.
We were wanting to ask

1331
00:53:06,830 --> 00:53:09,230
her boyfriend discussed this.
Super cool dude,

1332
00:53:09,231 --> 00:53:10,630
by the way.
Seems like a nice guy.

1333
00:53:10,650 --> 00:53:12,680
Seems like Nice,
but you're always asking.

1334
00:53:13,780 --> 00:53:17,060
You're asking questions.
You're not allowed to.

1335
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:19,220
You're not allowed to.
You ask questions,

1336
00:53:19,221 --> 00:53:21,500
but as soon as they leave,
as soon as they leave the room,

1337
00:53:21,501 --> 00:53:23,480
you're like that.
Well,

1338
00:53:23,481 --> 00:53:26,400
why can't you just ask,
what the fuck,

1339
00:53:26,401 --> 00:53:29,070
man,
I mean open as possible.

1340
00:53:29,071 --> 00:53:30,890
You're saying you used to be a man and
now you're a woman.

1341
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,880
He gets on the table now,
baby.

1342
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:34,860
What?
What could possibly be offensive after

1343
00:53:34,861 --> 00:53:36,030
that are more interesting?

1344
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:37,160
We're talking about that.
Well,

1345
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:38,340
the reason is because my,
my,

1346
00:53:38,380 --> 00:53:40,550
my mom who did wardrobe for the just for
laughs,

1347
00:53:40,570 --> 00:53:41,401
a lot of Kagan,
Sitcom,

1348
00:53:41,401 --> 00:53:45,150
so she just wardrobe for us now as we've
grown into these sketches and so Blair

1349
00:53:45,151 --> 00:53:48,540
white was the ghost of Christmas past
and this parody that we did and so my

1350
00:53:48,541 --> 00:53:51,180
mom had to go in and do wardrobe and
fitting.

1351
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:55,440
So she had some questions.
First question comes back to me.

1352
00:53:55,441 --> 00:53:55,801
She's like,
no,

1353
00:53:55,801 --> 00:53:58,940
I think she had the.
I don't think she has that anymore.

1354
00:53:58,950 --> 00:53:59,700
I'm like,
well why she?

1355
00:53:59,700 --> 00:54:00,750
Because she said,
you know,

1356
00:54:00,751 --> 00:54:02,040
I did all this work.
I'm like,

1357
00:54:02,050 --> 00:54:02,771
but mom,
that could just mean,

1358
00:54:02,771 --> 00:54:05,130
you know,
she clearly has breasts and lips,

1359
00:54:05,150 --> 00:54:05,730
you know,
just think.

1360
00:54:05,730 --> 00:54:06,451
No,
I don't.

1361
00:54:06,451 --> 00:54:09,570
I don't know,
but I know I don't know what the pants.

1362
00:54:09,571 --> 00:54:13,810
When we fit,
I need conversation.

1363
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:16,890
That's another hilarious character you
do.

1364
00:54:16,891 --> 00:54:19,950
Is that socialist French guy?
Montreal?

1365
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:21,590
Yeah.
You know,

1366
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:24,480
Bernie's like,
we've had interviews with people.

1367
00:54:24,540 --> 00:54:27,220
Did you meet Bernie?
You said he's on the flight with you was

1368
00:54:27,230 --> 00:54:27,891
on a flight with me.
No.

1369
00:54:27,891 --> 00:54:31,200
Here take a selfie with them.
I put on my socialism's for figs shirt

1370
00:54:31,290 --> 00:54:33,810
in the bathroom.
Here's what's so funny about Bernie

1371
00:54:33,810 --> 00:54:35,040
Sanders.
Socialism for fakes.

1372
00:54:35,100 --> 00:54:38,050
Figs says figs because it got pan from
instagram if you know.

1373
00:54:38,100 --> 00:54:40,680
So as a little fake least from the Che
air thing.

1374
00:54:40,681 --> 00:54:41,514
Anyway,
you'll see it.

1375
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:44,670
You'll see it if you go to the store.
Point is Bernie gets on a plane.

1376
00:54:46,290 --> 00:54:47,880
This is right after the debate with Ted
Cruz,

1377
00:54:47,910 --> 00:54:50,930
the healthcare debate.
We did not go well for him and uh,

1378
00:54:51,270 --> 00:54:53,160
he doesn't even have a briefcase.
So you know,

1379
00:54:53,161 --> 00:54:56,070
he's not doing work.
He's going from DC to Burlington,

1380
00:54:56,071 --> 00:54:58,200
Vermont and he is,
I swear to you,

1381
00:54:58,201 --> 00:55:03,201
I took a picture on the absolute last
row of economy plus plus where that

1382
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:05,430
first glass curtain goes by.

1383
00:55:05,490 --> 00:55:08,700
Probably ask for that because you know,
he can claim it like I don't fly first

1384
00:55:08,730 --> 00:55:10,650
class like you,
you're worth $5,000,000.

1385
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:14,340
You said there with 128 gigabyte ipad
pro,

1386
00:55:14,430 --> 00:55:16,160
I could see it because they had the new
beds bevel,

1387
00:55:16,270 --> 00:55:20,850
so I could say like saving all the money
to deal with his wife's lawsuit for

1388
00:55:20,851 --> 00:55:23,280
tanking that college in Vermont.
I know that college too.

1389
00:55:23,290 --> 00:55:26,250
Yeah.
That story is fucking crazy that it was

1390
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:30,090
a wild purchasing scheme that that tank,
the college,

1391
00:55:30,091 --> 00:55:32,970
like they decided to expand the land and
buy and they.

1392
00:55:33,010 --> 00:55:34,850
They tanked the college because of that
picture,

1393
00:55:34,860 --> 00:55:37,200
that America.
But what the fuck are you doing?

1394
00:55:37,201 --> 00:55:39,630
You're overspending.
Like what do you mean?

1395
00:55:39,631 --> 00:55:43,710
Why do you sound surprised?
What we need to do was get a rich

1396
00:55:43,711 --> 00:55:46,560
people's was fight.
So I put on the shirt and they're like,

1397
00:55:46,561 --> 00:55:47,370
you have to take a picture.

1398
00:55:47,370 --> 00:55:49,230
At this point it was what?
I was like 1230 in the morning.

1399
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:51,320
This.
I wasn't always that Burlington trinity

1400
00:55:51,321 --> 00:55:56,321
to them all and so I get off the plane
and Bernie gets off the plane first

1401
00:55:56,490 --> 00:55:59,210
priority plus plus plus,
but didn't get the free cocktail mine to

1402
00:55:59,230 --> 00:56:03,330
get off the plane first done after
firstclass firstclass,

1403
00:56:03,331 --> 00:56:05,100
then him,
he gets his second back.

1404
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:05,601
No,
no,

1405
00:56:05,601 --> 00:56:06,000
no,
no.

1406
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,220
First Class and then he's economy plus
plus plus.

1407
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:12,990
So first quarter since it first class,
first class and everything but name

1408
00:56:12,991 --> 00:56:13,980
only.
And you know,

1409
00:56:13,981 --> 00:56:16,080
he says that every debate on like my
opponent,

1410
00:56:16,081 --> 00:56:17,680
I don't sit in first class.
All Right Bernie.

1411
00:56:17,940 --> 00:56:21,770
So he gets out first and I walked behind
him and it was like a,

1412
00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:23,110
Oh gosh,
what's his name?

1413
00:56:23,111 --> 00:56:27,050
Brooks in Shawshank redemption.
He was so old and everyone's walking

1414
00:56:27,051 --> 00:56:30,880
down the street and he walks down this
one hallway by himself with his ipad pro

1415
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:33,010
and I remember calling Jerry said,
I can't do it.

1416
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:34,030
I said,
I can't get.

1417
00:56:34,190 --> 00:56:36,580
It's 1230 in the morning.
The guy looks like he's at death's door

1418
00:56:36,940 --> 00:56:39,160
and I didn't want to be that jerk a
corner and I just wanted to talk with

1419
00:56:39,161 --> 00:56:40,630
them.
I wasn't gonna Sandbag him,

1420
00:56:40,631 --> 00:56:43,810
but he looked so it was so sad.
Well,

1421
00:56:43,811 --> 00:56:47,170
his posture so awful.
His next sits in the middle of his

1422
00:56:47,171 --> 00:56:49,780
sternum.
Mr Burton.

1423
00:56:49,781 --> 00:56:51,430
Turtle.
It's crazy.

1424
00:56:51,431 --> 00:56:52,181
It's like,
man,

1425
00:56:52,181 --> 00:56:54,340
you got to sit up straight.
Like that's not healthy.

1426
00:56:54,350 --> 00:56:57,890
You got to be in pain all the time.
If your head is like that low,

1427
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:01,810
we'll,
we'll go to do the blue economy.

1428
00:57:02,830 --> 00:57:04,030
You got to get that money.
That blocks.

1429
00:57:04,050 --> 00:57:08,380
They could pay for my physical therapy.
Lifetime income inequality.

1430
00:57:08,770 --> 00:57:09,780
That's all.
He has a few bugs.

1431
00:57:09,781 --> 00:57:10,630
We're here.
Yeah,

1432
00:57:10,631 --> 00:57:14,670
but it's.
What I liked about him was that what he

1433
00:57:14,671 --> 00:57:17,650
was,
he seemed like a uniting force with

1434
00:57:17,651 --> 00:57:18,910
white people and black people.

1435
00:57:18,910 --> 00:57:22,900
It seemed like he was,
was doing interviews with killer Mike

1436
00:57:22,990 --> 00:57:25,300
even though he's anti gun,
you know,

1437
00:57:25,301 --> 00:57:28,360
and Mike is Super Pro gun.
I'm like,

1438
00:57:28,420 --> 00:57:30,190
but I'm like,
I like the fact that people are

1439
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:33,180
embracing this crazy old guy.
And then the stage,

1440
00:57:33,181 --> 00:57:35,680
the stage was like,
oh right.

1441
00:57:37,340 --> 00:57:38,900
So you mean he was the guiding force
because of

1442
00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:42,890
that was that was not the platform.
I mean they,

1443
00:57:43,450 --> 00:57:45,700
if they wanted to have a meeting,
they should have had a meeting.

1444
00:57:45,701 --> 00:57:49,690
You can't just jump up and mix it in the
White House office right now.

1445
00:57:49,691 --> 00:57:50,740
That'd be fine.
President,

1446
00:57:51,820 --> 00:57:53,320
president now,
I don't know.

1447
00:57:53,340 --> 00:57:55,100
I think the problem is,
you know,

1448
00:57:55,250 --> 00:57:57,340
even if you have people who were
economic socialist who were on board

1449
00:57:57,341 --> 00:57:58,990
with them,
we have a lot of people who were pro

1450
00:57:58,991 --> 00:58:00,880
Bernie who then changed because they
just said,

1451
00:58:00,881 --> 00:58:04,930
well then he went full sjw in the black
lives matter feminism and that's why I

1452
00:58:04,931 --> 00:58:09,250
say even if you find a leftish and
nobody believes that,

1453
00:58:09,310 --> 00:58:12,190
like you're saying when you're in these
town halls and they don't know that they

1454
00:58:12,191 --> 00:58:15,610
all agree,
it really is a monolith and like that's

1455
00:58:15,611 --> 00:58:15,970
what they say.

1456
00:58:15,970 --> 00:58:18,460
You're right wing.
Because the truth is you could be

1457
00:58:18,461 --> 00:58:20,110
considered right wing just like he could
just like,

1458
00:58:20,111 --> 00:58:21,910
I could just like Jordan Peterson could
just like my local,

1459
00:58:21,911 --> 00:58:24,220
just like mentioned and all of us have
wildly differing views.

1460
00:58:24,370 --> 00:58:26,320
If you were to check the box off with
Cenk,

1461
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:29,440
Bernie Sanders,
Hillary Clinton who take your pick,

1462
00:58:29,710 --> 00:58:32,980
they will check the same boxes because
they have to and I think that's why

1463
00:58:32,981 --> 00:58:35,320
they're losing so much ground culture
and the boxes are shifting to,

1464
00:58:35,321 --> 00:58:38,230
so we're,
we're the right side is expanding all

1465
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:39,580
the different boxes you could possibly
check.

1466
00:58:39,581 --> 00:58:42,040
The left is shrinking.
You have to get in line with these

1467
00:58:42,041 --> 00:58:42,790
things.
Well,

1468
00:58:42,790 --> 00:58:46,960
we need have a real center in this
country does not have a real center and

1469
00:58:46,970 --> 00:58:49,270
I think that drives people to the left
and to the right.

1470
00:58:49,650 --> 00:58:54,650
I think it's a big issue or there's.
There's just too much toxic tribal

1471
00:58:54,881 --> 00:58:55,714
thinking here.

1472
00:58:56,050 --> 00:58:57,740
I just think when you truth,
I really like that.

1473
00:58:57,741 --> 00:58:59,110
Something that to me is,
I don't care if you're left or right,

1474
00:58:59,111 --> 00:59:03,640
just don't lie to me and the left has
been able to lie to everyone because

1475
00:59:03,641 --> 00:59:06,250
they've controlled the information
delivery for a long time.

1476
00:59:06,380 --> 00:59:08,170
I know that sounds conspiratorial and
it's right.

1477
00:59:08,290 --> 00:59:09,850
It's like what we're talking about with
Tim Allen.

1478
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:11,260
I mean that is right.
Yeah.

1479
00:59:11,310 --> 00:59:12,700
I mean,
it's what we're talking about with

1480
00:59:12,701 --> 00:59:16,510
actors,
so you talk to most actors when it comes

1481
00:59:16,511 --> 00:59:19,000
to anything political,
they're almost all left wing.

1482
00:59:19,030 --> 00:59:21,270
That doesn't even make sense.
Like how the.

1483
00:59:21,530 --> 00:59:22,550
Exactly.
Yeah,

1484
00:59:22,551 --> 00:59:24,350
there's definitely,
there are a few people like we've had,

1485
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:26,100
you know,
like Gary sinise and the show.

1486
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:28,000
We've had some bigger name actress where
they have screw you money,

1487
00:59:28,010 --> 00:59:30,330
it doesn't matter,
but he's just the nicest guy ever where

1488
00:59:30,331 --> 00:59:31,430
he didn't even talk about politics.

1489
00:59:31,430 --> 00:59:35,840
He just builds these smart homes for
veterans just because he's like a saint,

1490
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:39,970
but there are other actors that we can't
even necessarily name who were like,

1491
00:59:40,010 --> 00:59:42,560
I'd really like to do the show,
but I can't yet when I get to this stage

1492
00:59:42,561 --> 00:59:44,420
of my career,
I'm sure you've probably heard from

1493
00:59:44,421 --> 00:59:46,490
those people too.
They're afraid.

1494
00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:47,953
Yeah.
Um,

1495
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:49,600
you know,
I've had people like that that say I

1496
00:59:49,601 --> 00:59:51,010
want to go hunting.
And I'm like,

1497
00:59:51,011 --> 00:59:51,501
uh,
yeah,

1498
00:59:51,501 --> 00:59:52,130
well let's,
uh,

1499
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:53,370
let's film it.
No,

1500
00:59:54,140 --> 00:59:56,120
no.
I'm like,

1501
00:59:56,121 --> 00:59:58,160
you don't want people to know that
that's how you get your food.

1502
00:59:58,161 --> 00:59:58,701
I mean,
you know,

1503
00:59:58,701 --> 01:00:01,440
97 percent of the country eats meat and
I'm like,

1504
01:00:01,450 --> 01:00:03,170
really?
Is that high on that high?

1505
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:05,360
Like what is it?
You're paying for it,

1506
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:07,100
right?
So you're paying for the murder,

1507
01:00:07,101 --> 01:00:09,050
you're cool with that,
but you're not cool with doing it

1508
01:00:09,051 --> 01:00:09,610
yourself.

1509
01:00:09,610 --> 01:00:10,191
Right?
He goes,

1510
01:00:10,191 --> 01:00:11,030
no,
I'm totally cool with that.

1511
01:00:11,031 --> 01:00:13,160
I just don't want anybody else to know
like,

1512
01:00:13,161 --> 01:00:15,020
okay,
well that's part of the problem because

1513
01:00:15,021 --> 01:00:19,610
people don't want anybody else to know.
That's why it becomes so scary and taboo

1514
01:00:19,940 --> 01:00:21,740
and very few people come out.
You know?

1515
01:00:21,741 --> 01:00:23,050
It's just,
it's,

1516
01:00:23,190 --> 01:00:25,250
it's,
it's a lot of the same thing because

1517
01:00:25,251 --> 01:00:27,860
it's like you not,
you're not willing to express your

1518
01:00:27,861 --> 01:00:30,740
authentic self will and that's the
university like we're going to be at

1519
01:00:30,741 --> 01:00:32,870
Virginia Tech.
Is it sixth a week from today,

1520
01:00:33,050 --> 01:00:35,180
a week from today,
and already people lined getting ready

1521
01:00:35,181 --> 01:00:36,710
on facebook to protest and they were
like,

1522
01:00:36,770 --> 01:00:38,990
you haven't even seen the show.
We don't even know what it is.

1523
01:00:38,991 --> 01:00:41,330
This is the first time we're going to
take the show on the road and broadcast

1524
01:00:41,331 --> 01:00:41,931
live.
I mean,

1525
01:00:41,931 --> 01:00:44,510
it's just a powder keg because no one's
allowed to think differently.

1526
01:00:44,870 --> 01:00:49,070
Picture collegiate campuses.
That's what the left.

1527
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:51,470
That's their utopia.
Listen,

1528
01:00:51,490 --> 01:00:53,780
you brought us something that,
um,

1529
01:00:54,080 --> 01:00:55,100
I think,
uh,

1530
01:00:55,190 --> 01:00:57,710
change the way people look at social
justice warriors.

1531
01:00:58,010 --> 01:01:02,930
That lady that was in the audience in
Amherst was puff.

1532
01:01:04,310 --> 01:01:08,150
That was like a gift from the heavens.
That poor gal.

1533
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:10,940
It was like somebody created the
caricature.

1534
01:01:11,050 --> 01:01:12,790
You assume her gender.
I did

1535
01:01:15,810 --> 01:01:20,810
confident I'm a pig,
but when she was screaming at you,

1536
01:01:21,861 --> 01:01:23,190
I'm like,
this is not real.

1537
01:01:23,550 --> 01:01:25,130
This is like,
but rex,

1538
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:27,380
this is not x,
but it's even worse.

1539
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:30,260
Shit,
this is not real.

1540
01:01:30,410 --> 01:01:32,450
This can't be real.
This woman's not really.

1541
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:34,250
This is like a caricature.
This is a,

1542
01:01:34,620 --> 01:01:37,220
this is a Michael J.
Fox movie from the eighties.

1543
01:01:37,221 --> 01:01:38,031
Were you like this?
No Way.

1544
01:01:38,031 --> 01:01:39,130
That's a real person.
Well,

1545
01:01:39,131 --> 01:01:41,700
you remember how stressed I was about
that because here's the deal.

1546
01:01:41,701 --> 01:01:43,040
Like this is my first time I was there.

1547
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:45,050
It was Milo and Christina Hoff summers.
Now at this point,

1548
01:01:45,051 --> 01:01:48,470
I only remember you should use a mac or
a coca cola when you went to college

1549
01:01:48,990 --> 01:01:50,960
back when.
So that was my experience with colleges

1550
01:01:51,020 --> 01:01:53,600
and I hated it,
but for the first time I know now that

1551
01:01:53,601 --> 01:01:56,720
people are going to be protesting to a
significant degree,

1552
01:01:56,980 --> 01:01:59,060
um,
and I just wanted to go out and do their

1553
01:01:59,061 --> 01:01:59,811
degree.
I do some,

1554
01:01:59,811 --> 01:02:00,441
like I was telling him,
I'm like,

1555
01:02:00,441 --> 01:02:02,060
oh,
I don't know what I do here because like

1556
01:02:02,090 --> 01:02:04,040
they're just going to speak and lecture
and I want to do just,

1557
01:02:04,041 --> 01:02:05,030
you know,
a 20 minute set,

1558
01:02:05,630 --> 01:02:07,280
you know,
it's really tough because if,

1559
01:02:07,281 --> 01:02:09,020
I don't know,
if you don't acknowledge the Heckler,

1560
01:02:09,380 --> 01:02:12,110
if you don't acknowledge the person,
but then when you come out and it's just

1561
01:02:12,190 --> 01:02:14,630
ugly puff who doesn't have enough middle
fingers to give.

1562
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:16,400
I've never given anyone that figure from
the stage.

1563
01:02:16,401 --> 01:02:17,420
I've never gone.
But I was like,

1564
01:02:17,450 --> 01:02:19,680
there's no.
I realized immediately I'm not gonna be

1565
01:02:19,681 --> 01:02:20,300
able to do stand

1566
01:02:20,300 --> 01:02:22,020
up.
And that was the ramp that went viral,

1567
01:02:22,410 --> 01:02:23,510
which I didn't expect it.
Like,

1568
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:25,500
I'm just going to stay.
I'm just going to do my set and then

1569
01:02:25,501 --> 01:02:29,550
afterwards we'll do a q and a.
They wouldn't allow it and I just saw

1570
01:02:29,551 --> 01:02:30,750
her and I,
I just couldn't.

1571
01:02:30,751 --> 01:02:33,090
She looked like the abroad from Monsters
Inc at the front desk.

1572
01:02:33,091 --> 01:02:35,080
I was just laugh like she really did.
Yeah,

1573
01:02:35,310 --> 01:02:37,950
just show and everyone wants to.
Here's the thing,

1574
01:02:38,580 --> 01:02:40,590
you know,
I think it was my parents who maybe said

1575
01:02:40,591 --> 01:02:44,010
this to me when I was young and I got
cocky about something at one point and

1576
01:02:44,011 --> 01:02:45,960
they said,
don't ever Brag because it it,

1577
01:02:46,080 --> 01:02:48,750
it does.
It keeps us from being able to brag for

1578
01:02:48,751 --> 01:02:50,070
you.
Let someone else do it.

1579
01:02:50,250 --> 01:02:51,240
That's interesting.
Why?

1580
01:02:51,241 --> 01:02:53,310
It's a good way of putting it.
Same thing with strictly.

1581
01:02:53,311 --> 01:02:54,270
Did they say it with an accent?

1582
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:57,470
We don't get to brag for you that she
had within this.

1583
01:02:57,480 --> 01:02:58,313
I don't know.
So,

1584
01:02:59,750 --> 01:03:02,970
so she had the work done.
We'll think about this if truly puff

1585
01:03:03,030 --> 01:03:07,650
didn't come out there and probably for
about eight seconds,

1586
01:03:07,651 --> 01:03:08,580
she took it out pretty quick.
She,

1587
01:03:08,670 --> 01:03:10,350
her dash didn't have the stamina,
needs carbs.

1588
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:14,130
If she didn't do that,
we would always sit in.

1589
01:03:14,131 --> 01:03:15,720
You're talking about how if we just saw
our,

1590
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:17,180
how we feel bad for her?
Yes.

1591
01:03:17,250 --> 01:03:18,180
Like,
Oh man,

1592
01:03:18,181 --> 01:03:19,100
that girl,
I hope she gets it,

1593
01:03:19,101 --> 01:03:20,340
you know,
and I feel it would be sympathetic,

1594
01:03:20,460 --> 01:03:23,400
but you prevent,
you preclude us from being empathetic

1595
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:26,310
when you act like an absolute piece of
shit.

1596
01:03:26,311 --> 01:03:30,060
Your whole life threat.
Like all of a sudden we've shut off this

1597
01:03:30,061 --> 01:03:33,120
empathy for people because of the way
they behave.

1598
01:03:33,150 --> 01:03:34,230
We would all be like,
oh man,

1599
01:03:34,231 --> 01:03:35,640
poor girl.
I hope she finds a guy.

1600
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:37,220
I'm sure she'll find a guy who likes
him,

1601
01:03:37,230 --> 01:03:38,220
you know,
bigger and you know,

1602
01:03:38,221 --> 01:03:39,750
she'll cheat and get it together.
And I've,

1603
01:03:39,751 --> 01:03:40,920
you know,
I've seen some people turn it around,

1604
01:03:40,921 --> 01:03:42,090
but when she does that,
you're just like,

1605
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:43,280
oh,
I can't stand speed.

1606
01:03:43,340 --> 01:03:44,091
Boldest hiring.
See,

1607
01:03:44,091 --> 01:03:47,520
I thought it was so ridiculous that it
didn't.

1608
01:03:47,550 --> 01:03:50,310
I didn't even think that way.
I'm obviously I wasn't in the room while

1609
01:03:50,311 --> 01:03:51,960
she was screaming at me while I was on
the stage.

1610
01:03:51,961 --> 01:03:55,320
I probably would have been furious,
but sitting back watching it from the

1611
01:03:55,321 --> 01:03:57,090
comfort of my house,
watching it on Youtube,

1612
01:03:57,091 --> 01:03:59,070
I was like,
what the fuck happened?

1613
01:03:59,650 --> 01:04:01,740
That's poor kid.
Like I just like,

1614
01:04:01,741 --> 01:04:04,100
this is used to be someone you know as a
person who has a daughter,

1615
01:04:04,110 --> 01:04:07,020
so like this is someone's baby.
And then became this,

1616
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:09,570
like someone didn't pay attention to
her.

1617
01:04:09,571 --> 01:04:13,800
They fed her bad food and,
and she's there by herself.

1618
01:04:13,830 --> 01:04:16,160
Like the whole thing was crazy.
Keep your hate speech off.

1619
01:04:16,170 --> 01:04:17,140
I can.
Meanwhile,

1620
01:04:17,250 --> 01:04:21,690
Christina Hoff summers by the way,
it couldn't be a nicer person and it was

1621
01:04:21,691 --> 01:04:24,420
so funny watching her with you and Milo
and she's like,

1622
01:04:24,421 --> 01:04:25,740
well,
I wouldn't say that.

1623
01:04:27,060 --> 01:04:29,970
I'm not necessarily saying that the
Islams stuff got.

1624
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:33,060
She got uncomfortable because on there
she couldn't be a nicer lady.

1625
01:04:33,061 --> 01:04:34,670
I really love her.
She's really sweet.

1626
01:04:34,671 --> 01:04:35,670
We'll think about that.
Were on there.

1627
01:04:35,671 --> 01:04:38,170
She's basically kind of a lifelong
Democrats

1628
01:04:39,720 --> 01:04:41,790
branded right wing.
She's branded all right.

1629
01:04:42,090 --> 01:04:45,600
She is a super feminist,
but she calls herself the factual

1630
01:04:45,601 --> 01:04:49,170
feminist and her idea is that when you
distort reality,

1631
01:04:49,171 --> 01:04:51,300
when you start biology,
when you start facts,

1632
01:04:51,301 --> 01:04:54,780
you are doing your cause a disservice,
which is her cause.

1633
01:04:55,110 --> 01:04:57,840
Being an actual feminist.
She's a real feminist and she doesn't

1634
01:04:57,841 --> 01:04:59,310
think there's anything wrong with being
a woman.

1635
01:04:59,670 --> 01:05:01,560
She's like,
she doesn't think there's anything wrong

1636
01:05:01,561 --> 01:05:04,310
with wearing dresses,
putting on makeup and lipstick.

1637
01:05:04,650 --> 01:05:05,580
You're a woman,
you know,

1638
01:05:05,940 --> 01:05:08,250
probably two boxes.
She didn't check in the left column,

1639
01:05:08,420 --> 01:05:09,320
therefore.
Yeah.

1640
01:05:09,380 --> 01:05:10,260
Right.
And by the way,

1641
01:05:10,261 --> 01:05:12,330
she doesn't think there's anything wrong
with not doing that either.

1642
01:05:12,660 --> 01:05:17,660
She's very open minded but.
But she calls bullshit and because she

1643
01:05:17,681 --> 01:05:22,600
calls bullshit on that group,
she's shoved into this fucking Nazi

1644
01:05:22,601 --> 01:05:24,470
category,
which is so crazy to me.

1645
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:26,770
Yeah.
And the danger with that is let's say 10

1646
01:05:26,771 --> 01:05:27,760
years down the line,
right,

1647
01:05:27,970 --> 01:05:30,880
you refer to me as not,
you refer to Joe Rogan is a Nazi,

1648
01:05:30,900 --> 01:05:32,350
not as a Nazi.
Christina Hoff summers.

1649
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:35,590
You know what happens is when you refer
to someone as a Nazi for reasonable use

1650
01:05:35,591 --> 01:05:37,510
for just long enough,
they start saying,

1651
01:05:37,511 --> 01:05:38,081
okay,
you know what,

1652
01:05:38,081 --> 01:05:41,890
let's go with Nazi and people actually
go for the pendulum swings further the

1653
01:05:41,891 --> 01:05:42,280
other way.

1654
01:05:42,280 --> 01:05:43,380
That's what you're seeing with Europe
through.

1655
01:05:43,420 --> 01:05:45,670
You're seeing what this far right rise
because they're like,

1656
01:05:45,671 --> 01:05:47,410
you know,
like spend computer who works for us.

1657
01:05:47,411 --> 01:05:48,760
We brought them over from Germany.
You said,

1658
01:05:48,761 --> 01:05:50,350
you know there's,
there's a certain point for young people

1659
01:05:50,351 --> 01:05:51,910
don't want to go to every museum and go,
yeah,

1660
01:05:51,911 --> 01:05:54,130
we suck because it had nothing to do
with it.

1661
01:05:54,260 --> 01:05:56,950
He was in Germany,
you pay 65 percent income tax if you're

1662
01:05:56,951 --> 01:06:00,790
under the age of 30 school is free.
Think about that.

1663
01:06:00,791 --> 01:06:04,540
For a 65 percent it's 50,
but spend was telling us there's some

1664
01:06:04,541 --> 01:06:06,490
additional.
It's basically 65 percent and it's

1665
01:06:06,491 --> 01:06:08,680
entirely based on your age bracket.
You're under 30,

1666
01:06:08,681 --> 01:06:11,440
you pay 65 percent.
That's your effective tax rate.

1667
01:06:12,310 --> 01:06:16,270
So you have these,
a lot of money that hurts.

1668
01:06:16,470 --> 01:06:17,590
Yeah,
but that's what you see.

1669
01:06:17,591 --> 01:06:18,970
You see this far right?
Rising Europe,

1670
01:06:19,030 --> 01:06:20,800
because if you call someone a Nazi for
so long,

1671
01:06:20,801 --> 01:06:21,051
I'm like,
well,

1672
01:06:21,051 --> 01:06:21,430
wait a second.

1673
01:06:21,430 --> 01:06:23,980
I'm not a Nazi.
I just don't want Paris to become a

1674
01:06:23,981 --> 01:06:24,814
rape.
Then.

1675
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:25,481
Yeah.
Well,

1676
01:06:25,481 --> 01:06:29,380
when you go from calling someone a Nazi
and then you see Charlottesville,

1677
01:06:29,381 --> 01:06:31,350
when you see guys with Nazi tattoos,
you go,

1678
01:06:31,390 --> 01:06:33,690
oh,
well that's not exactly.

1679
01:06:33,691 --> 01:06:37,420
This is a real Nazi.
This is a moron with a swastika tattooed

1680
01:06:37,421 --> 01:06:42,421
on his chest and a dodge challenger.
All this craziness left and right.

1681
01:06:43,601 --> 01:06:46,750
I just.
I'm just hoping it settles and what you

1682
01:06:46,751 --> 01:06:48,010
said.
Truth.

1683
01:06:48,270 --> 01:06:49,690
That's what I like.
Truth.

1684
01:06:49,750 --> 01:06:51,900
I don't think that's where I always.
You know,

1685
01:06:51,901 --> 01:06:53,050
I know people.
People get upset.

1686
01:06:53,051 --> 01:06:55,240
I don't think truth is necessarily in
the middle.

1687
01:06:55,450 --> 01:06:58,780
I think truth is truth and sometimes
it's really far to the right and

1688
01:06:58,781 --> 01:07:01,180
sometimes it's in the middle.
I don't think that there's much truth in

1689
01:07:01,210 --> 01:07:04,870
today's progressive left now.
I think there's an ideological war going

1690
01:07:04,871 --> 01:07:07,000
on and I think especially with trump in
office,

1691
01:07:07,001 --> 01:07:10,420
they feel like the gloves are off and
all rules are out the window and

1692
01:07:10,421 --> 01:07:11,254
anything goes.

1693
01:07:11,320 --> 01:07:13,540
Yeah,
I think people are flabbergasted and.

1694
01:07:13,860 --> 01:07:16,140
Well,
I was telling Jamie before the show like

1695
01:07:16,270 --> 01:07:17,240
I'm,
I'm,

1696
01:07:17,480 --> 01:07:22,270
I'm not without my criticisms for trump,
but I got to admit every time stuff just

1697
01:07:22,271 --> 01:07:26,170
rolls off his back like water on a duck.
I start fucking laughing like they were

1698
01:07:26,171 --> 01:07:27,880
like the stormy Daniels thing is going
to sink them.

1699
01:07:28,060 --> 01:07:32,410
I have a friend of mine who's who's gay
and he's the nicest guy in the world,

1700
01:07:32,411 --> 01:07:33,940
but he's so ridiculous.
He's like,

1701
01:07:34,150 --> 01:07:36,200
that's our Monica Lewinsky.
She's harmonically.

1702
01:07:36,230 --> 01:07:36,940
I go,
dude,

1703
01:07:36,940 --> 01:07:38,260
it's not going to work.
I go,

1704
01:07:38,261 --> 01:07:39,900
no one's going to care.
It's gonna.

1705
01:07:39,910 --> 01:07:41,380
It's gonna disappear in a couple of
weeks ago.

1706
01:07:41,381 --> 01:07:43,660
We're in a 10 hour new cycle.
Do you understand this?

1707
01:07:43,890 --> 01:07:46,240
I go in 10 hours,
some new shit comes along and nobody

1708
01:07:46,241 --> 01:07:49,180
gives a fuck about Brett ratner anymore
and nobody gives a fuck about this guy.

1709
01:07:49,181 --> 01:07:51,010
Nobody.
And there's a new guy and there's a new

1710
01:07:51,011 --> 01:07:52,750
thing and there's a new problem and
there's a new thing.

1711
01:07:52,930 --> 01:07:56,410
There's a new thing and you saying that
this porn star thing,

1712
01:07:56,590 --> 01:07:59,950
this is not 1994,
this porn star thing is not going to

1713
01:07:59,951 --> 01:08:01,450
sink him.
He's going to deny it.

1714
01:08:01,451 --> 01:08:03,910
Fake News,
fake nose and he's going to keep moving

1715
01:08:04,060 --> 01:08:05,980
and there's going to be nothing.
Yeah,

1716
01:08:06,250 --> 01:08:08,410
I don't even.
I don't even know what happened with

1717
01:08:08,411 --> 01:08:10,630
that exactly,
but to me I remember I just was like,

1718
01:08:10,631 --> 01:08:12,490
I got a disconnect for a bit because
I've been just going,

1719
01:08:12,491 --> 01:08:12,911
going,
going.

1720
01:08:12,911 --> 01:08:16,340
So I disconnected and like kind of
popped my head in for half a day

1721
01:08:16,670 --> 01:08:17,870
just because we're moving to a new
studio,

1722
01:08:17,871 --> 01:08:19,250
kind of like you've been doing and upon
my head it was like,

1723
01:08:19,251 --> 01:08:19,780
well,
what's the news?

1724
01:08:19,780 --> 01:08:21,920
What's this outrage right now?
Do I need to know about Donald Trump?

1725
01:08:21,980 --> 01:08:22,880
And they said,
no.

1726
01:08:22,881 --> 01:08:24,800
Yeah.
He called a Haiti a shit hole.

1727
01:08:25,690 --> 01:08:26,650
I just popped my head back.
I'm like,

1728
01:08:26,720 --> 01:08:27,710
of course it is.
That's it.

1729
01:08:27,890 --> 01:08:29,960
No one cares anymore.
Of course Haiti is that.

1730
01:08:29,990 --> 01:08:33,190
It doesn't mean you hate Haitians said,
why do these people from these shithole

1731
01:08:33,230 --> 01:08:36,680
countries want to come here?
That's what a supposedly said.

1732
01:08:37,100 --> 01:08:39,770
He says he didn't say it.
Some people say he did.

1733
01:08:40,070 --> 01:08:42,050
Other people say he didn't.
Who Cares?

1734
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:45,340
So we're in a weird quagmire.
If he says he did,

1735
01:08:45,790 --> 01:08:46,520
he did.
Yeah.

1736
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:49,880
It's not the appropriate thing for a
president of the United States to say,

1737
01:08:49,910 --> 01:08:52,910
but does it make sense that Donald Trump
would say that?

1738
01:08:53,580 --> 01:08:54,110
No,
no,

1739
01:08:54,110 --> 01:08:54,400
no,
no,

1740
01:08:54,400 --> 01:08:55,970
no.
You want to know how you know it's a

1741
01:08:55,971 --> 01:08:59,210
shit hole because French Canadian,
some of the most racist people you will

1742
01:08:59,211 --> 01:09:01,580
find love you mom,
but they create these French laws.

1743
01:09:01,581 --> 01:09:02,740
I've talked about this before.
Pure land.

1744
01:09:02,750 --> 01:09:04,820
It means pure wool because they want to
get rid of all the anglophone.

1745
01:09:04,990 --> 01:09:06,710
Right?
And so then they had a huge Asian

1746
01:09:06,740 --> 01:09:08,990
immigration because there's a lot of
French and people from Cameroon,

1747
01:09:09,140 --> 01:09:11,420
special diseases because of inbreeding
and they were furious.

1748
01:09:11,421 --> 01:09:14,020
So they try to create laws to keep the
Haitians out because they were.

1749
01:09:14,430 --> 01:09:17,030
It was just a clash of cultures.
Here's the thing,

1750
01:09:17,330 --> 01:09:20,510
Haiti is whether Donald trump,
senator not as a country,

1751
01:09:20,870 --> 01:09:23,900
a shitty place,
and I don't think anyone cares anymore.

1752
01:09:23,980 --> 01:09:26,750
She doesn't mean I hate Haitians,
doesn't mean I'm not empathetic to them,

1753
01:09:26,930 --> 01:09:29,690
but fortunate that they're in a bad
place,

1754
01:09:29,870 --> 01:09:33,140
but how is it racist if especially
you're criticizing a government which

1755
01:09:33,141 --> 01:09:35,840
comprises of black people who are
screwing a black citizenry.

1756
01:09:36,260 --> 01:09:38,990
They've been doing it for decades.
They've never gotten rain.

1757
01:09:39,080 --> 01:09:44,080
Wilson took a picture from sandals,
pickled pitcher from Club Med sandals.

1758
01:09:45,020 --> 01:09:46,340
Most people don't even know what that
is.

1759
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:48,330
The resort.
That's so funny.

1760
01:09:48,750 --> 01:09:50,750
Yeah,
the Bahamas,

1761
01:09:50,751 --> 01:09:53,530
I think Jamaica,
one of those places.

1762
01:09:54,010 --> 01:09:57,110
No locale and all the other shit holes.
I mean,

1763
01:09:57,111 --> 01:09:58,400
I just like.
It's one of those things where I think

1764
01:09:58,430 --> 01:10:02,990
if nothing else,
Donald Trump has allowed people and we

1765
01:10:02,991 --> 01:10:04,880
weren't trump people.
We got so much flak from the outright

1766
01:10:04,940 --> 01:10:06,830
because we didn't support them.
I remember that.

1767
01:10:06,831 --> 01:10:09,560
And you were more in support of a Ted
Cruz,

1768
01:10:09,561 --> 01:10:10,090
right?
Oh,

1769
01:10:10,090 --> 01:10:15,090
I'll let Carly Fiorina and Ben Shapiro.
I mean Ben Carson a little bit,

1770
01:10:15,471 --> 01:10:16,760
right?
I just thought it was hysterical.

1771
01:10:16,910 --> 01:10:19,500
He's a smart guy,
so he's like,

1772
01:10:19,501 --> 01:10:20,450
it's so crazy.
Yeah,

1773
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:23,120
he's like a Jim Henson care.
My favorite thing was him with Jesus.

1774
01:10:23,121 --> 01:10:26,830
The painting that Jesus on his shoulder
like,

1775
01:10:26,840 --> 01:10:27,710
whoa,
Ben,

1776
01:10:28,430 --> 01:10:30,680
neurosurgeon during an absolute genius
in that,

1777
01:10:30,681 --> 01:10:34,840
but you don't have the sense of like
maybe a little bit.

1778
01:10:35,340 --> 01:10:37,220
Well,
Jordan Peterson said something that's

1779
01:10:37,221 --> 01:10:40,070
very brilliant.
He said there is absolutely no

1780
01:10:40,071 --> 01:10:42,440
correlation with being smart and being
wise.

1781
01:10:42,920 --> 01:10:44,090
It's true.
It's true.

1782
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:46,940
There's a lot of people that are really
fucking smart things,

1783
01:10:47,060 --> 01:10:51,380
but they are not wise in terms of how
they behave and how they think and how

1784
01:10:51,381 --> 01:10:56,381
they conduct their life and whether or
not they pay for a Jesus painting their

1785
01:10:56,870 --> 01:10:58,310
shoulder.
It doesn't even look like Jesus.

1786
01:10:58,311 --> 01:11:03,050
It looks like a Puerto Rican
dude is slinging tacos.

1787
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:05,000
It's a crazy painting.
It's so.

1788
01:11:05,001 --> 01:11:07,520
It's so bad.
I just knew this guy up here.

1789
01:11:07,560 --> 01:11:08,430
Yeah.
Nice.

1790
01:11:08,720 --> 01:11:09,620
Well,
everything's new.

1791
01:11:09,740 --> 01:11:12,200
We um,
used to have stars,

1792
01:11:12,201 --> 01:11:14,070
but the,
the panels were too

1793
01:11:14,070 --> 01:11:17,340
dark in this room because the lighting
is different here.

1794
01:11:17,341 --> 01:11:20,130
So we change them to clouds.
Got The American flag into that.

1795
01:11:20,150 --> 01:11:23,610
So people also think you're right wing.
Think about America or when do you ever

1796
01:11:23,611 --> 01:11:24,750
see a leftist?
Yeah.

1797
01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:27,900
When do you ever see the current
progressive leftist with patriotic

1798
01:11:27,901 --> 01:11:31,650
symbolism?
I usually have a American flag,

1799
01:11:31,710 --> 01:11:34,530
a case,
but I ordered one for the iphone x and I

1800
01:11:34,531 --> 01:11:36,150
didn't get it yet.
Look,

1801
01:11:36,151 --> 01:11:38,970
I love America.
I think America represents a beautiful

1802
01:11:38,971 --> 01:11:40,950
place of opportunity and it's not
perfect,

1803
01:11:40,951 --> 01:11:43,440
but I think it's the best place.
I've been to a lot of different places.

1804
01:11:43,770 --> 01:11:45,660
You know,
if you think there's something wrong

1805
01:11:45,661 --> 01:11:47,580
with being patriotic,
I think you're fucking crazy.

1806
01:11:47,581 --> 01:11:50,070
I don't think America represents the
worst aspects of us.

1807
01:11:50,071 --> 01:11:55,071
I think it represents possibility and
promise and that you have this ability

1808
01:11:55,351 --> 01:11:56,580
to do whatever the fuck you want to do.

1809
01:11:56,580 --> 01:11:59,970
There's not a class structure.
You can literally go from the bottom to

1810
01:11:59,971 --> 01:12:01,210
the top.
I mean you,

1811
01:12:01,211 --> 01:12:01,700
you,
you,

1812
01:12:01,700 --> 01:12:03,660
you can do whatever the fuck you want to
do in this country.

1813
01:12:03,661 --> 01:12:06,030
There's some restrictions.
People say it's not a free country.

1814
01:12:06,420 --> 01:12:07,500
Hey man,
go to Canada.

1815
01:12:07,650 --> 01:12:09,930
It's a lot more fucking free than Canada
and Canada.

1816
01:12:10,020 --> 01:12:12,840
You can go to jail for not using
someone's preferred gender.

1817
01:12:12,841 --> 01:12:17,841
Pronouns is a case that just was out a
couple of days ago where some woman had

1818
01:12:18,481 --> 01:12:22,830
a sign and it was a it and they boiled
it down to like one word,

1819
01:12:23,010 --> 01:12:27,780
but her,
her sign said that I'm a transgender

1820
01:12:27,781 --> 01:12:32,340
woman is a man and you're just because
you feel something like that.

1821
01:12:32,341 --> 01:12:36,120
It does not overtake biology and
emphasis like long thing.

1822
01:12:36,500 --> 01:12:41,280
I'm just transgenders person wanted to
file a human rights violation case

1823
01:12:41,281 --> 01:12:46,281
against her and get her arrested and
said that the only way this person would

1824
01:12:46,561 --> 01:12:50,850
not would be willing to not do that was
b would be to sit down with this woman

1825
01:12:50,851 --> 01:12:53,160
and have coffee with her,
explained to her why she's wrong.

1826
01:12:53,540 --> 01:12:54,960
Well,
she doesn't think she's wrong,

1827
01:12:54,980 --> 01:12:57,440
so that's where you can't just decide
that this person has to act.

1828
01:12:57,441 --> 01:13:00,030
We ask.
They have to give into your particular

1829
01:13:00,031 --> 01:13:03,180
ideology and your line of thinking.
Otherwise it's hate speech.

1830
01:13:03,330 --> 01:13:06,480
That's not the answer like the answer
to.

1831
01:13:06,690 --> 01:13:10,050
If you think someone's wrong,
the answer is proving them wrong.

1832
01:13:10,170 --> 01:13:14,310
Having a conversation about it,
like some someone deciding that not only

1833
01:13:14,311 --> 01:13:16,180
is it wrong,
they're going to lock you up for it,

1834
01:13:16,430 --> 01:13:18,540
sue you.
That's crazy.

1835
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:21,690
And I think especially with that Trudeau
guy up there like,

1836
01:13:21,950 --> 01:13:24,560
Ooh,
deepen,

1837
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:27,180
remove a couple of bucks and you
could've just to run for office with

1838
01:13:27,181 --> 01:13:28,230
that speech.
It was very inspiring.

1839
01:13:28,620 --> 01:13:31,650
I could probably get up there and be,
if I could be a Canadian.

1840
01:13:31,990 --> 01:13:34,560
I'm a big fan of Canada.
I'm a big fan,

1841
01:13:34,561 --> 01:13:37,210
but they've got a few problems.
You know,

1842
01:13:37,260 --> 01:13:39,060
the first person ever voted for was
Stephen Harper.

1843
01:13:39,270 --> 01:13:40,560
Right?
So here's the deal back then.

1844
01:13:40,590 --> 01:13:42,090
Now I'm that guy.
I'm open about it.

1845
01:13:42,091 --> 01:13:42,840
Christian,
conservative,

1846
01:13:42,840 --> 01:13:45,600
everyone who harper.
Steven Harper was prime minister before

1847
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:47,280
Trudeau.
So Stephen Harper is the Canadian

1848
01:13:47,281 --> 01:13:50,850
equivalent of a conservative,
so that would be like a little left to

1849
01:13:51,070 --> 01:13:53,070
have John Casick here in the states.
Here's there,

1850
01:13:53,100 --> 01:13:54,430
Megan.
They kind of heard that he was.

1851
01:13:54,490 --> 01:13:56,460
I mean we,
they didn't have the housing bubble

1852
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:58,470
because they didn't do the subprime
loans.

1853
01:13:59,140 --> 01:14:01,620
Candidate was doing really well for the
first time was hiring the economic

1854
01:14:01,621 --> 01:14:04,560
freedom index in the United States.
I voted for him and everyone hated him.

1855
01:14:04,561 --> 01:14:06,510
Why?
Because he was a practicing Christian

1856
01:14:06,511 --> 01:14:09,030
conservative who believed in some form
of limited government.

1857
01:14:09,240 --> 01:14:10,500
Well,
now they have trudeau.

1858
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:11,633
It's like,

1859
01:14:12,100 --> 01:14:15,280
I remember Steven Watson was a pastor
and I talked about this a lot and this

1860
01:14:15,281 --> 01:14:17,020
was a slippery slope thing.
It was a no,

1861
01:14:17,021 --> 01:14:17,471
no,
you're just,

1862
01:14:17,471 --> 01:14:20,650
you're just crazy religious nutbag.
This Guy Steven Wilson was a pastor who

1863
01:14:20,651 --> 01:14:22,960
I think was jailed.
He certainly was fine just because he

1864
01:14:22,961 --> 01:14:24,280
said,
I don't care what the laws of the land.

1865
01:14:24,610 --> 01:14:27,160
I'm not going to marry two men in my
congregation.

1866
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:28,560
I'm not going to recognize that as
marriage.

1867
01:14:28,570 --> 01:14:30,460
That's what he said.
Whether you agree with them or not.

1868
01:14:30,490 --> 01:14:33,060
This was years ago,
and uh,

1869
01:14:33,550 --> 01:14:35,260
people in the left back then supporting
it because like,

1870
01:14:35,261 --> 01:14:36,160
well,
the only affects the,

1871
01:14:36,180 --> 01:14:37,860
the Christian pastor doesn't want to
marry dudes.

1872
01:14:37,890 --> 01:14:38,890
Beckon.
Well now it doesn't.

1873
01:14:38,920 --> 01:14:41,200
Now it affects the person who says,
if you're born a man,

1874
01:14:41,201 --> 01:14:43,090
you're a man.
And now it affects Mike Ward,

1875
01:14:43,091 --> 01:14:45,680
the comedian who was put before human
rights tribunal for making fun of the

1876
01:14:45,681 --> 01:14:47,200
make a wish kid foundation.

1877
01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:48,280
Yeah,
it does.

1878
01:14:48,310 --> 01:14:50,950
At a certain point you have to draw the
line and we want to decide that we're

1879
01:14:50,951 --> 01:14:52,900
going to draw the line when it comes to
like for example,

1880
01:14:52,901 --> 01:14:56,940
puberty blockers or do we draw the line
when someone tries to strangle Ben

1881
01:14:56,940 --> 01:14:59,860
Shapiro and the Dr drew show because he
implies that the guy with a penis is

1882
01:14:59,861 --> 01:15:01,360
still a man still.
There was.

1883
01:15:01,390 --> 01:15:04,870
That was rough.
That was a rough one because the guy was

1884
01:15:04,871 --> 01:15:08,950
literally threatening violence and it
was okay because Ben had ms dot

1885
01:15:08,951 --> 01:15:10,590
gendered.
Him and they cared have to have been

1886
01:15:10,600 --> 01:15:10,841
like,
well,

1887
01:15:10,841 --> 01:15:11,411
Ben,
Ben,

1888
01:15:11,411 --> 01:15:14,260
to be fair,
you knew that was gonna not only touched

1889
01:15:14,290 --> 01:15:16,210
him,
putting his hands on him,

1890
01:15:16,211 --> 01:15:18,670
which is very threatening.
If someone's threatening me and they're

1891
01:15:18,671 --> 01:15:20,760
putting their hands on me.
I'm on def con nine.

1892
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:22,120
I'm ready to go.
Like,

1893
01:15:22,121 --> 01:15:23,110
where's this going,
bitch?

1894
01:15:23,110 --> 01:15:25,300
Why are you holding onto me?
We fighting.

1895
01:15:25,330 --> 01:15:25,930
Yes,
you're,

1896
01:15:25,930 --> 01:15:28,630
you're holding me.
You're gripping me and holding me and

1897
01:15:28,631 --> 01:15:31,390
you're way bigger than me.
That guy was way girl.

1898
01:15:32,020 --> 01:15:36,220
Shit way bigger than Ben,
but ben's Ben was fucking strong.

1899
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:39,190
That seems wildly inappropriate is one
of those guys

1900
01:15:41,880 --> 01:15:43,540
were sitting there like,
oh my gosh,

1901
01:15:43,660 --> 01:15:44,240
but yeah.
He said,

1902
01:15:44,240 --> 01:15:46,870
if you don't sound like the joker,
you're going to wind up.

1903
01:15:46,871 --> 01:15:47,920
If you don't speak,
you're going to want it.

1904
01:15:47,930 --> 01:15:49,420
You're gonna.
Go home in an ambulance.

1905
01:15:50,050 --> 01:15:52,180
It's like,
are you going to beat me up because I

1906
01:15:52,181 --> 01:15:54,170
say the wrong word.
Really?

1907
01:15:54,340 --> 01:15:55,570
Imagine.
That's what I'm saying.

1908
01:15:56,090 --> 01:15:58,630
You were a man.
He was like the clubber Lang of trainees

1909
01:15:59,010 --> 01:16:00,760
know.
That was one of the things that I got

1910
01:16:00,761 --> 01:16:03,220
into it with someone online about Fallon
Fox.

1911
01:16:03,520 --> 01:16:06,340
I said,
someone said she was always a woman.

1912
01:16:06,370 --> 01:16:07,000
I go,
okay,

1913
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:08,620
but you know,
she got a man.

1914
01:16:08,740 --> 01:16:09,910
She.
She had a penis.

1915
01:16:09,940 --> 01:16:14,020
She used to be mad.
She got a woman pregnant and had a kid

1916
01:16:14,110 --> 01:16:15,640
with that woman.
I go,

1917
01:16:15,730 --> 01:16:17,050
was she a woman?
Then she goes,

1918
01:16:17,051 --> 01:16:18,520
even then I'm like,
we're done.

1919
01:16:19,150 --> 01:16:19,890
We're done.
We're in.

1920
01:16:19,890 --> 01:16:20,920
We're in Narnia.
Again,

1921
01:16:21,790 --> 01:16:25,510
documented that a woman is to youtube
because I didn't expect that.

1922
01:16:25,660 --> 01:16:28,630
I felt like I could say,
Hey,

1923
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:31,750
I don't think it's cool if you get your
penis removed to beat the fuck out of

1924
01:16:31,751 --> 01:16:35,650
women.
I just felt like that's a safe thing to

1925
01:16:35,670 --> 01:16:38,310
start
going to be a contribution.

1926
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:40,270
People like you're a bigot,
and I was like,

1927
01:16:40,271 --> 01:16:41,680
wow.
Well,

1928
01:16:41,770 --> 01:16:44,860
okay,
maybe you should at least tell them.

1929
01:16:44,861 --> 01:16:46,030
They used to be a man.
No,

1930
01:16:46,031 --> 01:16:49,330
it's a medical procedure and it has no
basis whatsoever on your physical

1931
01:16:49,331 --> 01:16:50,164
performance.
Well,

1932
01:16:50,220 --> 01:16:52,720
well that's not even structurally true.
That doesn't even make any sense.

1933
01:16:52,730 --> 01:16:55,310
The physical body's built differently,
you know?

1934
01:16:55,330 --> 01:16:57,400
Can you imagine if brock lesnar decided
to be a woman?

1935
01:16:57,720 --> 01:17:00,630
Just just imagine just not enough
hormone blockers in the world.

1936
01:17:00,640 --> 01:17:03,220
Keep that and then they didn't have to
tell anybody.

1937
01:17:03,221 --> 01:17:04,600
No.
It's a medical procedure.

1938
01:17:05,880 --> 01:17:07,600
They don't want you left.
Doesn't want you to tell people you have

1939
01:17:07,601 --> 01:17:09,290
aged so much.
I mean a penis as much.

1940
01:17:09,350 --> 01:17:13,060
That's the one you're on now,
Chad with not wonderful.

1941
01:17:13,100 --> 01:17:16,010
It used to be a felony and now it should
be.

1942
01:17:16,100 --> 01:17:20,030
Yes.
If you know you have a fatal disease and

1943
01:17:20,031 --> 01:17:22,130
you fuck someone in the but without a
condom,

1944
01:17:22,520 --> 01:17:25,400
that's where I'd read pool party.
That can't just be.

1945
01:17:25,401 --> 01:17:27,680
It can't just be transferred by playing.
Spin the bottle.

1946
01:17:27,710 --> 01:17:30,200
Did you ever see the guy who authored
that?

1947
01:17:30,950 --> 01:17:32,840
Yes.
The folsom street fair with the little

1948
01:17:32,841 --> 01:17:35,300
leather,
like a Bryan singer Pool Party.

1949
01:17:35,301 --> 01:17:36,410
It's hilarious.

1950
01:17:36,440 --> 01:17:39,020
It's hysterical that that guy pass that
through its people weren't paying

1951
01:17:39,021 --> 01:17:41,210
attention.
Like that's crazy.

1952
01:17:41,211 --> 01:17:44,870
Like I don't care if it's.
I don't care if it's aids or if you

1953
01:17:44,871 --> 01:17:49,550
could give someone cancer you,
if you have cancer and you know,

1954
01:17:49,551 --> 01:17:51,380
you have.
I mean if it was a communicable disease

1955
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:54,080
and you decided to make out with someone
who doesn't have cancer and he gave it

1956
01:17:54,081 --> 01:17:56,450
to them like fuck man,
he just killed somebody.

1957
01:17:56,451 --> 01:18:00,020
You just smoked a pipe and kissed me and
now I have a soft skull cancer.

1958
01:18:00,590 --> 01:18:03,000
The bigger conversation on that too is
um,

1959
01:18:03,380 --> 01:18:06,920
like obviously it's not fatal anymore
because of protease inhibitors and all

1960
01:18:06,921 --> 01:18:10,160
this stuff,
but you just compared age to cancer was

1961
01:18:10,250 --> 01:18:12,320
once a day where you could just compare
aids to aids.

1962
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:15,290
Well,
they used to Callie's the gay cancer,

1963
01:18:15,330 --> 01:18:17,240
you know,
that's when aids first came out.

1964
01:18:17,270 --> 01:18:18,620
They called it the gay cancer.
Oh,

1965
01:18:18,621 --> 01:18:20,120
we did.
We did a thing on that where we did a

1966
01:18:20,121 --> 01:18:22,160
defensive.
We did a show wishbone.

1967
01:18:22,790 --> 01:18:25,520
We did a parody with our dog hopper.
We did the AIDS epidemic and the AIDS

1968
01:18:25,521 --> 01:18:27,590
epidemic was always a hoax.
There was never an epidemic.

1969
01:18:27,740 --> 01:18:31,550
Basically if you were not doing heroin
with dirty needles or having unprotected

1970
01:18:31,551 --> 01:18:33,530
sex with George Michael,
you were pretty much safe.

1971
01:18:33,950 --> 01:18:35,330
People got so mad.
She knew it.

1972
01:18:35,420 --> 01:18:36,081
Yeah.
We just.

1973
01:18:36,081 --> 01:18:37,970
People knew what.
Do you remember the kinison bit?

1974
01:18:38,450 --> 01:18:38,931
Yeah,
I remember.

1975
01:18:38,931 --> 01:18:41,280
The kid isn't bit hysterical.
Yeah,

1976
01:18:41,540 --> 01:18:44,080
so we had a guy who came on.
It was actually very civil who disagreed

1977
01:18:44,081 --> 01:18:45,320
with by the end of it.
He just said,

1978
01:18:45,321 --> 01:18:46,760
well,
I guess it just disagreed because the

1979
01:18:46,761 --> 01:18:48,300
way you said it was so incendiary,
and I said,

1980
01:18:48,330 --> 01:18:51,080
hold on a second.
Why is it in Cindy or I am the one

1981
01:18:51,081 --> 01:18:53,990
actually trying to prevent people from
getting aids.

1982
01:18:54,050 --> 01:18:56,690
There are very specific patterns of
behavior that you avoid.

1983
01:18:57,170 --> 01:18:58,970
Don't have gang protected sex and a
truck stop.

1984
01:18:59,510 --> 01:19:02,180
Don't do heroin and the East village
like rent.

1985
01:19:02,250 --> 01:19:03,950
Where ever wanting to be rent.
Ever see that movie?

1986
01:19:04,040 --> 01:19:05,630
No,
because I'm straight.

1987
01:19:06,310 --> 01:19:09,420
I was crying at rent.
Oh,

1988
01:19:09,470 --> 01:19:12,680
and like every.
Every single person was doing heroin and

1989
01:19:12,681 --> 01:19:14,840
the East village and having unprotected
sex with each other.

1990
01:19:15,020 --> 01:19:17,350
If you make it past noon without getting
aids,

1991
01:19:17,351 --> 01:19:18,900
you're on borrowed time.
Like how am I?

1992
01:19:18,901 --> 01:19:21,350
I don't feel bad for you at this point,
but we had people,

1993
01:19:21,351 --> 01:19:24,290
they give us so much flack over the aids
epidemic and none of them disagreed with

1994
01:19:24,291 --> 01:19:26,480
the statistics.
You're just not supposed to say it.

1995
01:19:26,720 --> 01:19:29,780
Think about that for a second though.
The issue with that folsom street fair,

1996
01:19:29,781 --> 01:19:31,550
a senator or congressman,
you know,

1997
01:19:31,560 --> 01:19:34,490
I'm the guy with the beautiful leather
vest.

1998
01:19:34,760 --> 01:19:37,730
No shirt on underneath it.
Wander through the streets with a tire

1999
01:19:37,731 --> 01:19:40,070
around his neck that looks suspiciously
like a leash.

2000
01:19:40,100 --> 01:19:42,880
It was a hot topic discount.
I know Donald Trump had got

2001
01:19:45,090 --> 01:19:48,890
on sale at the hello kitty backpack.
So his argument,

2002
01:19:48,891 --> 01:19:49,970
I remember it was,
well,

2003
01:19:50,030 --> 01:19:51,200
this,
these laws,

2004
01:19:51,260 --> 01:19:52,970
only these disclosure laws,
and by the way,

2005
01:19:52,971 --> 01:19:54,890
for people who don't know what means,
you have to disclose that you have aids

2006
01:19:54,891 --> 01:19:56,380
if you're having sex with somebody.
Right?

2007
01:19:56,700 --> 01:19:59,120
These was only served to stigmatize
people.

2008
01:19:59,150 --> 01:20:02,630
Hold on a second.
Does it mean that we cannot stigmatize

2009
01:20:02,690 --> 01:20:07,410
anyone or anything ever?
We cannot stigmatize Abe's,

2010
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:08,620
right?

2011
01:20:08,620 --> 01:20:12,060
Like it doesn't mean we hate you,
but we consciously delivering it into

2012
01:20:12,061 --> 01:20:13,530
someone.
I mean that's,

2013
01:20:13,560 --> 01:20:15,510
that's the problem.
Like being aware.

2014
01:20:15,690 --> 01:20:16,940
At what point are we okay?
Stigmatized,

2015
01:20:17,100 --> 01:20:18,840
right?
I mean what does it take to say like,

2016
01:20:19,050 --> 01:20:20,010
well you know what,
okay,

2017
01:20:20,011 --> 01:20:23,400
maybe we should stigmatize.
If I were to use an absurd example in a

2018
01:20:23,401 --> 01:20:24,090
bit,
we'll be like,

2019
01:20:24,090 --> 01:20:26,370
okay,
maybe we should stigmatize knowingly

2020
01:20:26,371 --> 01:20:30,120
transferring aids to somebody through
unprotected sex as a goof.

2021
01:20:30,510 --> 01:20:32,180
But instead like how we don't want to
stigmatize.

2022
01:20:32,190 --> 01:20:33,690
You're not even supposed to say aids,
right?

2023
01:20:33,691 --> 01:20:36,480
Because it's HIV and then HIV gives a
aids,

2024
01:20:36,540 --> 01:20:38,700
you know,
you get aids because your immune system

2025
01:20:38,701 --> 01:20:42,150
is compromised.
What aids is a syndrome acquired immune

2026
01:20:42,180 --> 01:20:46,440
deficiency syndrome.
I never got more hate in all the years I

2027
01:20:46,441 --> 01:20:48,960
did this podcast.
Then one of the early,

2028
01:20:48,961 --> 01:20:50,340
early,
early episodes.

2029
01:20:50,610 --> 01:20:54,120
What was that doctor's name?
The doctor from the University of

2030
01:20:54,120 --> 01:20:54,953
California,
Berkeley.

2031
01:20:55,710 --> 01:20:58,230
He is ostracized from the medical
community,

2032
01:20:58,231 --> 01:21:00,270
but he's a Duisburg.
Yes,

2033
01:21:00,360 --> 01:21:03,420
Dr Peter Duesberg.
He wrote an article in Spin magazine

2034
01:21:03,421 --> 01:21:04,171
way,
way,

2035
01:21:04,171 --> 01:21:06,990
way back in the day and his assertion
was that

2036
01:21:08,550 --> 01:21:13,550
HIV is a very weak virus and that HIV is
appearing in the systems of these people

2037
01:21:14,911 --> 01:21:16,800
because they have compromised immune
systems.

2038
01:21:16,801 --> 01:21:20,580
It's not aids,
it's not HIV that's giving these people

2039
01:21:20,581 --> 01:21:23,250
compromised immune systems.
They already have compromised immune

2040
01:21:23,251 --> 01:21:27,360
systems and he was saying the reason why
they're having these compromised immune

2041
01:21:27,361 --> 01:21:32,361
systems is because of aml nitrate and
crystal meth and party drugs,

2042
01:21:33,210 --> 01:21:37,110
and he showed overwhelming like in his,
in his mind,

2043
01:21:37,350 --> 01:21:42,350
overwhelming evidence that all these
people that got aids were getting their

2044
01:21:43,830 --> 01:21:45,630
immune system was compromised because of
partying.

2045
01:21:45,980 --> 01:21:48,360
They were saying,
this is why it's so prevalent in the gay

2046
01:21:48,361 --> 01:21:50,330
party community.
He's like you,

2047
01:21:50,340 --> 01:21:55,340
and he was talking about how you destroy
your immune system with animal nitrate.

2048
01:21:55,650 --> 01:21:59,790
You destroy your immune system with
crystal meth and if you check the immune

2049
01:21:59,791 --> 01:22:02,460
system of these people,
of course it's going to be devastated.

2050
01:22:02,461 --> 01:22:05,940
They're doing hardcore party drugs and
they're doing them all the time.

2051
01:22:06,870 --> 01:22:11,100
He,
he said this and he published a bunch of

2052
01:22:11,101 --> 01:22:12,900
stuff on it.
People went crazy.

2053
01:22:13,200 --> 01:22:14,190
I mean it was,
it was,

2054
01:22:14,191 --> 01:22:18,960
it was not a scientific debate.
It was more of a social issue.

2055
01:22:19,110 --> 01:22:21,570
How dare you stigmatize crystal Meth,
like it wasn't,

2056
01:22:21,571 --> 01:22:23,580
but if it wasn't a gay thing,
here's the thing.

2057
01:22:24,300 --> 01:22:28,800
If aids was just something you found
truckstop people who were just doing

2058
01:22:28,801 --> 01:22:32,070
math and,
and shooting heroin and they're all,

2059
01:22:32,071 --> 01:22:34,860
for whatever reason they're getting this
disease,

2060
01:22:34,980 --> 01:22:35,820
you would go,
oh,

2061
01:22:35,821 --> 01:22:38,910
I bet it disease is probably.
Maybe has something to do with the fact

2062
01:22:38,911 --> 01:22:39,870
they're all doing meth.
No,

2063
01:22:39,900 --> 01:22:42,370
no.
Unrelated but,

2064
01:22:42,570 --> 01:22:43,590
but meth bad.
Right?

2065
01:22:43,591 --> 01:22:44,424
Oh,
it's terrible.

2066
01:22:44,460 --> 01:22:46,590
But I'm anal nitrates devastate.
Oh,

2067
01:22:46,650 --> 01:22:50,010
instant brain damage.
Able nitrate causes instant brain

2068
01:22:50,011 --> 01:22:51,470
damage.
You pop one of those stages of

2069
01:22:53,010 --> 01:22:55,290
ammonia poppers.
Yeah,

2070
01:22:55,291 --> 01:22:56,000
they,
they do.

2071
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:57,330
Um,
apparently opens.

2072
01:22:57,360 --> 01:22:58,770
Well,
a lot of power lifters would do those

2073
01:22:58,771 --> 01:23:00,930
before big.
Like setting some smelling salts.

2074
01:23:00,970 --> 01:23:02,370
Yeah,
different different stuff.

2075
01:23:02,520 --> 01:23:05,160
Email nitrate is a potent drug.
Yeah.

2076
01:23:05,440 --> 01:23:08,290
I'm actually.
Somebody talked about that yesterday.

2077
01:23:08,291 --> 01:23:09,640
Ben Greenfield talked about it
yesterday.

2078
01:23:09,641 --> 01:23:13,330
Some insanely disgusting smelling salt
that you could barely hold up to your

2079
01:23:13,331 --> 01:23:17,130
nose and you do lifts like right after
that excites your,

2080
01:23:17,220 --> 01:23:18,910
your,
your central nervous system.

2081
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:22,820
It's firing lavender
cinnamon.

2082
01:23:22,950 --> 01:23:24,660
Yeah,
but anyway,

2083
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:28,450
I don't know what the facts are.
I'm not a fucking biologist.

2084
01:23:28,451 --> 01:23:30,020
This guy is a.
he's a.

2085
01:23:30,040 --> 01:23:32,440
he's a tenured professor.
The University of California.

2086
01:23:32,441 --> 01:23:34,270
Berkeley can't get funding for anything.
He's done.

2087
01:23:34,271 --> 01:23:36,490
Rock solid research on cancer,
has really interesting guy,

2088
01:23:36,940 --> 01:23:39,640
but all the other aids researchers
denounce him.

2089
01:23:40,070 --> 01:23:42,730
Everyone else that's involved in HIV and
they might be right.

2090
01:23:42,820 --> 01:23:44,890
They very well could be right.
I don't know if he's right or he's

2091
01:23:44,891 --> 01:23:46,930
wrong.
It seems to me more likely that he's

2092
01:23:46,931 --> 01:23:49,870
wrong because no one,
no one has come forward like

2093
01:23:49,900 --> 01:23:53,080
legitimately on his side in terms of
scientific research.

2094
01:23:53,110 --> 01:23:54,210
Based on what you're saying,
from what I hear,

2095
01:23:54,220 --> 01:23:56,980
I'm like my.
My inclination is sounds like he may be

2096
01:23:56,981 --> 01:23:57,910
wrong,
but here's the thing.

2097
01:23:58,420 --> 01:24:01,420
I'm not offended that you brought it up.
He's a fucking biologist,

2098
01:24:01,510 --> 01:24:03,730
you know,
but that's what's crazy about it that

2099
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:06,230
that's why I can't think of any shows on
the other,

2100
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:07,360
let's say center,
right?

2101
01:24:07,361 --> 01:24:10,150
Other side of the political spectrum
where they wouldn't be offended by that.

2102
01:24:10,151 --> 01:24:11,500
Like you said,
you had so much crap.

2103
01:24:12,340 --> 01:24:15,100
Maybe he's wrong from everything I know
about HIV and aids.

2104
01:24:15,250 --> 01:24:16,540
Seems as though he's wrong.

2105
01:24:16,570 --> 01:24:20,350
I don't know enough to say he's wrong,
but I've heard enough people that know

2106
01:24:20,351 --> 01:24:22,720
enough that say he's wrong,
that I believed them,

2107
01:24:23,020 --> 01:24:26,810
but people were sending me messages.
Blood's on your hands and this and that.

2108
01:24:26,811 --> 01:24:29,410
I'm like,
if you went out and had unprotected,

2109
01:24:29,411 --> 01:24:31,930
but sex after listening to the Joe Rogan
experience,

2110
01:24:32,230 --> 01:24:34,900
you deserve what's coming.
Okay.

2111
01:24:34,901 --> 01:24:37,000
If you listen to me and you're like,
that's it.

2112
01:24:37,330 --> 01:24:39,280
Peter Duesberg,
send it in.

2113
01:24:40,140 --> 01:24:45,140
Rex Bite is going on.
You can't demonize conversations and I

2114
01:24:46,871 --> 01:24:50,350
don't know enough about the subject,
but I listened to.

2115
01:24:50,680 --> 01:24:53,260
That guy's take on it and it's fuel for
thought.

2116
01:24:53,290 --> 01:24:54,400
You know?
I don't think he's right,

2117
01:24:55,300 --> 01:24:57,150
but I,
I've talked to a lot of people that I

2118
01:24:57,151 --> 01:24:59,770
don't figure right now.
I've talked to some crazy fucking people

2119
01:24:59,771 --> 01:25:04,771
on the show and I think you got to be
able to have conversations.

2120
01:25:05,110 --> 01:25:05,830
You have to.

2121
01:25:05,830 --> 01:25:08,230
Well,
I mean we might agree on 60 percent of

2122
01:25:08,231 --> 01:25:09,011
things,
maybe 50,

2123
01:25:09,011 --> 01:25:10,990
maybe it's somewhere between 40 and 70.
I don't know.

2124
01:25:11,270 --> 01:25:12,700
It doesn't matter.
It should be okay,

2125
01:25:12,770 --> 01:25:15,350
but should be totally fine.
And that's the thing when we do know

2126
01:25:15,490 --> 01:25:18,550
change my mind segments,
most time people it's pretty amicable

2127
01:25:18,551 --> 01:25:21,470
and then you just get someone who comes
up and wants to commit assault truly

2128
01:25:21,490 --> 01:25:23,590
puffs and it's like,
I think a big skill.

2129
01:25:23,591 --> 01:25:26,310
We've kind of had to learn this because
Nikee jared knows,

2130
01:25:26,360 --> 01:25:28,300
um,
when we first had guests,

2131
01:25:28,301 --> 01:25:30,750
if it was,
if it was a guest which disagreed with,

2132
01:25:30,770 --> 01:25:31,510
I was like,
listen,

2133
01:25:31,510 --> 01:25:34,360
I will not edit you.
It will not be taken out of context.

2134
01:25:34,600 --> 01:25:38,020
But I would sit down for three hours
with them because they would be like,

2135
01:25:38,021 --> 01:25:38,920
don't cut me off.
Don't come up.

2136
01:25:38,921 --> 01:25:40,180
And you realize it just repeating
themselves.

2137
01:25:40,630 --> 01:25:43,990
So finding that balance of seeing there.
A lot of people out there now who are

2138
01:25:44,050 --> 01:25:46,870
open to hearing these points that you
are open to hearing these ideas,

2139
01:25:47,380 --> 01:25:50,320
being able to identify them and then
being able to identify the people who

2140
01:25:50,321 --> 01:25:52,420
are so bought in,
they won't even listen.

2141
01:25:52,780 --> 01:25:56,860
You need to make an example of them for
the people you can convince and

2142
01:25:56,861 --> 01:25:58,690
understanding the two different kinds of
people.

2143
01:25:58,691 --> 01:26:01,070
The trigger puffs versus uh,
you know,

2144
01:26:01,090 --> 01:26:02,020
I don't know,
Jordan Peterson,

2145
01:26:02,021 --> 01:26:05,510
you'll probably never saw himself as
even political at all until he came out

2146
01:26:05,511 --> 01:26:09,020
and said something that would seem to be
so benign and caused an uproar.

2147
01:26:09,890 --> 01:26:11,450
I think being able to identify those
tools,

2148
01:26:11,540 --> 01:26:16,280
not so much just about left and right.
Who can hear who won't and how to handle

2149
01:26:16,281 --> 01:26:16,820
them.
Right.

2150
01:26:16,820 --> 01:26:18,410
And why?
Why can't you hear?

2151
01:26:18,411 --> 01:26:22,880
Can you not hear because it interferes
with your ideology or can you not hear

2152
01:26:22,881 --> 01:26:25,040
because it's what they're saying is
illogical.

2153
01:26:25,130 --> 01:26:26,620
Like which one is it?
Is it,

2154
01:26:26,840 --> 01:26:29,180
are you honestly listening to what
they're saying?

2155
01:26:29,450 --> 01:26:34,160
And can you give factual refute?
Can you give some sort of a factual

2156
01:26:34,161 --> 01:26:35,690
review of this?
Or is it just,

2157
01:26:36,140 --> 01:26:38,740
it just doesn't jive with your view of
the world you have,

2158
01:26:38,790 --> 01:26:41,330
you have some rock solid view of the
world that you're not,

2159
01:26:41,530 --> 01:26:44,730
you're not willing to look at it and
your perspective because that's the

2160
01:26:44,731 --> 01:26:46,550
undercover thing with negative.
By the way,

2161
01:26:46,551 --> 01:26:49,830
balls of steel doing this.
Let's talk about that one because what

2162
01:26:49,850 --> 01:26:51,620
we got,
we've got video of that one too.

2163
01:26:51,621 --> 01:26:56,030
Um,
you went undercover with the Antifa and

2164
01:26:56,450 --> 01:26:59,480
that fucking,
that one was disturbing to me because

2165
01:26:59,690 --> 01:27:02,900
first of all you look like slide right
in like a glove buddy.

2166
01:27:02,901 --> 01:27:05,240
Like I was almost matching the guy when
I got there.

2167
01:27:05,241 --> 01:27:05,721
Guy,
Gal,

2168
01:27:05,721 --> 01:27:07,360
we don't know.
Um,

2169
01:27:07,390 --> 01:27:10,940
and I thought our costume wardrobe lady
had actually just just stolen his

2170
01:27:10,941 --> 01:27:13,880
clothes because it was almost identical
to what he was wearing.

2171
01:27:13,910 --> 01:27:16,550
Isn't it funny though that when you're a
slender man,

2172
01:27:16,610 --> 01:27:19,760
like people assume.
Oh yeah,

2173
01:27:19,761 --> 01:27:21,840
I can get away with so much crap.
Weird.

2174
01:27:21,930 --> 01:27:22,700
Yeah.
Well,

2175
01:27:22,700 --> 01:27:25,610
what is it about slender people?
There's something there,

2176
01:27:25,700 --> 01:27:27,500
right?
Like what is it about slender people

2177
01:27:27,501 --> 01:27:29,570
that are almost always left wing
weakness?

2178
01:27:30,230 --> 01:27:31,460
Whoa.
You think so?

2179
01:27:31,880 --> 01:27:32,713
Sorry.

2180
01:27:34,230 --> 01:27:37,180
Could same.
They see the American flag is right

2181
01:27:37,181 --> 01:27:38,410
wing.
They see this.

2182
01:27:38,411 --> 01:27:39,850
This.
You might still be the Third Reich.

2183
01:27:40,320 --> 01:27:42,750
Hm?
Can I say third wreck?

2184
01:27:42,751 --> 01:27:46,020
I don't even know what it is right now.
I don't know.

2185
01:27:46,100 --> 01:27:48,680
I don't know what else and designs.
Check them out on it.

2186
01:27:48,900 --> 01:27:50,970
It's actually really nice.
Veteran your is that steel?

2187
01:27:51,090 --> 01:27:52,140
Yeah.
That's pretty cool.

2188
01:27:52,170 --> 01:27:52,690
Guy makes them.

2189
01:27:52,690 --> 01:27:53,331
That's it.
That's it.

2190
01:27:53,331 --> 01:27:55,190
I can usually.
I can usually tell when someone's

2191
01:27:55,191 --> 01:27:57,170
approaching us,
if they're friendly or fell by their

2192
01:27:57,171 --> 01:28:00,710
posture and their body size guy walks in
your body size.

2193
01:28:00,711 --> 01:28:00,981
I'm like,
oh,

2194
01:28:00,981 --> 01:28:05,930
that's probably a friendly guy.
Like a queer looking at hundred and 40

2195
01:28:05,931 --> 01:28:07,350
pound man like myself.
Approaches and like,

2196
01:28:07,360 --> 01:28:08,510
ah,
we got to get out of dodge.

2197
01:28:08,511 --> 01:28:13,511
He has a shank or screwdriver.
The biggest passing out solid shotguns

2198
01:28:15,191 --> 01:28:16,024
and our goal.
I know it.

2199
01:28:16,260 --> 01:28:17,450
I know.
I did know because I was like,

2200
01:28:17,451 --> 01:28:19,790
I had done two and now I get made every
time I go out after you know,

2201
01:28:19,791 --> 01:28:21,500
you dress with the tranny and you need
to be Wendy Davis.

2202
01:28:21,530 --> 01:28:24,050
My wig flies off.
She still goes along with it.

2203
01:28:24,410 --> 01:28:28,350
I'm on every message.
You got to go in there and a technical

2204
01:28:28,351 --> 01:28:31,220
level also didn't want to pull the seal
team six Michigan between Wednesday and

2205
01:28:31,221 --> 01:28:31,890
Friday shelf.

2206
01:28:31,890 --> 01:28:34,970
So it's true.
But what happened is then when you were

2207
01:28:34,971 --> 01:28:36,200
in,
you wanted to go back.

2208
01:28:36,230 --> 01:28:37,040
That's true.
I was just.

2209
01:28:37,040 --> 01:28:40,370
How did it get psyched to explain to me
how it got set up,

2210
01:28:40,430 --> 01:28:41,730
how you did it?
Like what,

2211
01:28:41,731 --> 01:28:44,260
what,
what was the meeting balls of stuff.

2212
01:28:44,430 --> 01:28:44,900
Uh,
well,

2213
01:28:44,900 --> 01:28:48,320
I mean these kind of.
These things are much different than the

2214
01:28:48,320 --> 01:28:49,630
Burlington Vermont kind of gigs.
I mean that was a throwaway.

2215
01:28:49,670 --> 01:28:54,020
This one took months of planning is
wrench to Britain to especially to a,

2216
01:28:54,021 --> 01:28:57,390
to infiltrating the back end of Antifa
red and red.

2217
01:28:57,400 --> 01:28:59,990
We call them regional.
We have a guy who does research for us.

2218
01:29:00,110 --> 01:29:00,930
Uh,
don't,

2219
01:29:00,930 --> 01:29:02,010
don't make an,
I won't get into

2220
01:29:02,010 --> 01:29:04,890
anything specific,
but he is the high level professor.

2221
01:29:04,940 --> 01:29:06,390
Okay.
He has a,

2222
01:29:06,610 --> 01:29:11,610
he has a 650 something pound squat.
You'd like Bain in real life and a

2223
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:13,590
brilliant.
He was the one who found the salon

2224
01:29:13,591 --> 01:29:15,880
pedophile.
That's why we broke that pedophile

2225
01:29:16,310 --> 01:29:17,143
article.
Yeah.

2226
01:29:17,210 --> 01:29:19,520
We were the first ones to write about
how he was currently actively a

2227
01:29:19,521 --> 01:29:22,110
pedophile.
He sent it to me within 10 minutes,

2228
01:29:22,140 --> 01:29:24,280
but he's the man of the chairman of gay
currently out.

2229
01:29:24,370 --> 01:29:26,730
I wasn't a practicing pedophile,
right?

2230
01:29:26,790 --> 01:29:27,390
No,
he was.

2231
01:29:27,390 --> 01:29:28,770
He was.
He talked about grooming and all that

2232
01:29:28,771 --> 01:29:30,170
stuff and we wrote about it.
Yeah.

2233
01:29:30,390 --> 01:29:34,050
Really double down on it today.
And then three more articles.

2234
01:29:34,051 --> 01:29:34,884
Yeah.
Yeah.

2235
01:29:34,920 --> 01:29:36,600
Anyway,
the point is registered as Reggie does.

2236
01:29:36,601 --> 01:29:39,030
Brilliant.
Remove those articles.

2237
01:29:39,750 --> 01:29:40,860
I don't know,
maybe they did,

2238
01:29:41,130 --> 01:29:43,680
but they did like two or three,
but Reggie is a brilliant researcher.

2239
01:29:43,681 --> 01:29:45,060
And so at this point,
explain that though,

2240
01:29:45,061 --> 01:29:47,220
because you were glossing over this for
people that are just listening.

2241
01:29:47,220 --> 01:29:49,590
Please explain like what that was like,
those articles.

2242
01:29:49,770 --> 01:29:50,700
Uh,
sorry.

2243
01:29:50,701 --> 01:29:53,640
Yeah.
We're starting off with a salon.com.

2244
01:29:53,700 --> 01:29:55,260
What was their first articles?
I'm a pedophile,

2245
01:29:55,261 --> 01:29:58,260
but I'm not a monster.
And it was talking about how you know,

2246
01:29:58,261 --> 01:29:59,640
the way to deal with us,
and again,

2247
01:29:59,641 --> 01:30:00,840
not to stigmatize us.
I'm like,

2248
01:30:00,841 --> 01:30:01,501
listen,
I'm sorry.

2249
01:30:01,501 --> 01:30:02,580
To a certain point,
I'm empathetic,

2250
01:30:02,581 --> 01:30:05,040
but we send you to therapy.
You still want to have sex with kids,

2251
01:30:05,100 --> 01:30:06,570
we take you out of the village.
We shoot you.

2252
01:30:06,600 --> 01:30:08,040
We can't take that risk.
Sorry.

2253
01:30:08,070 --> 01:30:09,090
That's it.
Um,

2254
01:30:09,330 --> 01:30:10,530
so he was like,
I'm not a monster.

2255
01:30:10,680 --> 01:30:13,540
And talked about how his struggles with
his family.

2256
01:30:13,600 --> 01:30:14,700
Okay.
You can kind of understand it.

2257
01:30:14,701 --> 01:30:19,290
But then Reggie did some research.
We found all of his online message board

2258
01:30:19,390 --> 01:30:23,130
is pseudonyms,
is usernames and coded language about

2259
01:30:23,131 --> 01:30:25,630
grooming,
grooming me,

2260
01:30:25,650 --> 01:30:28,830
like your grooming kids online.
So we found all of it and we released an

2261
01:30:28,831 --> 01:30:33,180
article on it and then salon released
another article where he responded and

2262
01:30:33,181 --> 01:30:34,014
didn't call us up by name.

2263
01:30:34,020 --> 01:30:39,020
It was like my week in the right wing
hates fear and they rated it on salon,

2264
01:30:39,361 --> 01:30:43,410
like we're the bad guys because we found
out that you're grooming children and

2265
01:30:43,411 --> 01:30:45,390
they released a few and we're like,
we just realized,

2266
01:30:45,391 --> 01:30:46,200
okay,
this is the thing,

2267
01:30:46,200 --> 01:30:48,750
kinda like hormone blockers for kids'
salons.

2268
01:30:48,751 --> 01:30:50,190
Cool.
With an active file.

2269
01:30:50,910 --> 01:30:52,800
Let's move on now we're not going to do
it.

2270
01:30:52,801 --> 01:30:54,720
There's no more convincing to be done
here.

2271
01:30:55,170 --> 01:30:58,140
So red was the one who found it in.
Reggie was the one who infiltrated a lot

2272
01:30:58,141 --> 01:30:59,490
of the antifa groups,
you know,

2273
01:30:59,660 --> 01:31:01,440
that that's not his real name,
but he has so many.

2274
01:31:01,441 --> 01:31:03,900
This guy's just brilliant.
So he had been doing research on the

2275
01:31:03,901 --> 01:31:04,980
back end,
uh,

2276
01:31:05,180 --> 01:31:07,470
upon request and was so good.
So we had all this research.

2277
01:31:07,471 --> 01:31:09,870
We knew who these people were.
We kind of knew what they were planning

2278
01:31:09,871 --> 01:31:11,370
with Ben Shapiro going into Utah.

2279
01:31:11,930 --> 01:31:13,440
Um,
as a matter of fact,

2280
01:31:13,441 --> 01:31:15,240
we were going to go to Berkeley right
before that,

2281
01:31:15,241 --> 01:31:18,060
but then last minute we found out that
they weren't going to do it because we

2282
01:31:18,061 --> 01:31:21,690
know where they meet.
We run their cryptic apps where they

2283
01:31:21,691 --> 01:31:23,250
would text you.
So as these apps that you would

2284
01:31:23,251 --> 01:31:24,590
download,
like I don't know if we're allowed.

2285
01:31:24,630 --> 01:31:26,720
Are we allowed to say that?
I don't know.

2286
01:31:26,970 --> 01:31:29,730
I think yeah,
the FBI came to us for information

2287
01:31:29,731 --> 01:31:30,181
afterwards,
like,

2288
01:31:30,181 --> 01:31:31,014
Oh yeah,
we were tracking these.

2289
01:31:31,140 --> 01:31:35,330
There were arrests made a because of
your undercover thing will arrest,

2290
01:31:35,340 --> 01:31:37,360
made on the people seen undercover same
people.

2291
01:31:37,380 --> 01:31:40,380
So they committed crimes again later
that day and were arrested.

2292
01:31:40,710 --> 01:31:43,320
So the same person who handed him a
shank later that day assaulted,

2293
01:31:43,321 --> 01:31:46,680
so the rest of so.
So Reggie gets you the information and

2294
01:31:46,681 --> 01:31:50,160
then you how do you make contact with
these people?

2295
01:31:50,640 --> 01:31:53,460
We will be part of their facebook
grouping.

2296
01:31:53,470 --> 01:31:54,750
So we found out where they wanted to
meet.

2297
01:31:54,810 --> 01:31:59,620
When I'm went aware and we showed up to
campus and I walk in as

2298
01:32:00,220 --> 01:32:03,940
Jason Antifa person new to the
organization,

2299
01:32:04,060 --> 01:32:09,060
say I want to be involved glue content
and that's all it takes on context slide

2300
01:32:09,680 --> 01:32:13,090
blue contexts.
Just because we're on a budget,

2301
01:32:13,091 --> 01:32:14,290
we need to disguise.
So why?

2302
01:32:14,590 --> 01:32:16,810
Why do you need to disguise?
You didn't think you could slip up.

2303
01:32:16,870 --> 01:32:18,920
You thought people would recognize it a
bit.

2304
01:32:18,970 --> 01:32:21,910
We could have been on their radar,
but then now they tried to find this in

2305
01:32:21,911 --> 01:32:22,511
a,
in a,

2306
01:32:22,511 --> 01:32:26,230
in Austin and to put it on posters,
we tape the interview with Tim Kennedy

2307
01:32:26,231 --> 01:32:29,470
and they were passing out flyers just
when you get waterboarded no,

2308
01:32:29,490 --> 01:32:31,630
no.
That was another time that would much

2309
01:32:31,631 --> 01:32:32,820
rather than whining.
Yeah,

2310
01:32:32,830 --> 01:32:33,730
he did.
He did.

2311
01:32:33,910 --> 01:32:36,000
That was no joke.
And I'd rather do that than the CNN 16

2312
01:32:36,010 --> 01:32:37,210
hour live stream.
That's not a joke.

2313
01:32:37,480 --> 01:32:39,790
I'd rather be waterboarded.
But anyways.

2314
01:32:39,880 --> 01:32:40,713
Good enough.
Dot.

2315
01:32:41,350 --> 01:32:43,730
Yeah.
So we show up this coffee house there me

2316
01:32:44,150 --> 01:32:49,150
starbucks on campus
where he just put me to starbucks.

2317
01:32:51,180 --> 01:32:56,180
So I found him met up.
He gives me the cryptic messaging APP a.

2318
01:32:57,310 --> 01:32:58,510
was it a he or she?
Did you find out?

2319
01:32:58,511 --> 01:33:00,370
We don't know.
I was sure it was a heat because it was

2320
01:33:00,371 --> 01:33:05,371
a wedding band in this shit up zero zero
sitting there with his wedding band,

2321
01:33:05,930 --> 01:33:09,100
a iphone seven and is brought on the
side.

2322
01:33:09,120 --> 01:33:11,080
It gives me the APP and says,
we'll see you tomorrow.

2323
01:33:11,290 --> 01:33:12,123
So I say,
okay,

2324
01:33:12,190 --> 01:33:14,410
see you.
Then he gives me full communication.

2325
01:33:14,411 --> 01:33:17,060
They did roll call,
roll call and said,

2326
01:33:17,061 --> 01:33:19,860
okay everyone roll call.
We've got Jason and the group like,

2327
01:33:20,260 --> 01:33:23,620
yeah,
it's like fire bird fibered uh,

2328
01:33:23,940 --> 01:33:28,630
well they went down to like all these,
like firebird and rogue two in flame

2329
01:33:28,631 --> 01:33:29,800
thrower nine.
And then there was,

2330
01:33:30,050 --> 01:33:31,280
will,
will,

2331
01:33:31,560 --> 01:33:34,960
will,
will name feral family fund immediately

2332
01:33:34,961 --> 01:33:36,820
because I wasted so swiftly.
We'll.

2333
01:33:36,821 --> 01:33:37,870
It's so easy to find.

2334
01:33:37,930 --> 01:33:39,550
How could you figure out who will was?
Well,

2335
01:33:39,551 --> 01:33:41,140
because the phone numbers are also
listed.

2336
01:33:41,470 --> 01:33:44,530
It's encrypted messaging APP doesn't
lie,

2337
01:33:44,531 --> 01:33:46,540
take screenshots,
but it turns out if you have another

2338
01:33:46,541 --> 01:33:49,310
phone you can take a photo of your
screen.

2339
01:33:49,410 --> 01:33:52,330
She's a physical camera,
but they didn't seem to work out this

2340
01:33:52,331 --> 01:33:54,970
kink in the plans.
But the snapchat thing,

2341
01:33:54,971 --> 01:33:57,730
when people are sending Dick Pics,
like normal going to see it.

2342
01:33:58,540 --> 01:33:59,980
No one's going to see what you can't
say.

2343
01:34:00,060 --> 01:34:01,740
You can't do screenshots.
It just informs the person,

2344
01:34:01,750 --> 01:34:03,670
which is so much worse than if someone
actually took it.

2345
01:34:03,671 --> 01:34:05,440
It's like,
that just makes it worse for everybody

2346
01:34:05,930 --> 01:34:09,520
to take a photo of it with another
camera.

2347
01:34:09,521 --> 01:34:10,870
Like you said.
I'm sorry.

2348
01:34:10,871 --> 01:34:11,680
So,
so go ahead.

2349
01:34:11,680 --> 01:34:15,350
So all these people role playing there,
there in dungeons and dragon.

2350
01:34:15,351 --> 01:34:17,170
Exactly.
So we,

2351
01:34:17,171 --> 01:34:18,490
uh,
we go back to her hotel,

2352
01:34:18,491 --> 01:34:20,180
get ready for the next day,
uh,

2353
01:34:20,680 --> 01:34:22,360
and show up on campus where they're
supposed to,

2354
01:34:22,640 --> 01:34:24,910
to,
to meet up and get to your nervous as

2355
01:34:24,911 --> 01:34:28,810
hell because he's like,
I was more nervous the day before

2356
01:34:28,810 --> 01:34:30,740
because I didn't know what I was walking
out short.

2357
01:34:30,750 --> 01:34:32,860
Is it want to play it first?
And they're all like 30 seconds.

2358
01:34:32,920 --> 01:34:34,650
Okay.
It's about to license from a,

2359
01:34:34,740 --> 01:34:37,880
from Antifa for which one do you want me
to start with our,

2360
01:34:38,200 --> 01:34:41,710
the
producer around

2361
01:34:43,240 --> 01:34:44,620
these people.
So different than me.

2362
01:34:45,430 --> 01:34:49,120
They were openly advocating violence and
they were openly.

2363
01:34:49,210 --> 01:34:52,440
They were offering to give you a gun?
Not at first.

2364
01:34:52,540 --> 01:34:57,500
Not at first because you actually said
the funny part before you said we got

2365
01:34:57,501 --> 01:35:00,770
into a fight and you said this is not my
job description.

2366
01:35:01,130 --> 01:35:03,290
And I said it is exactly in your job
description.

2367
01:35:03,440 --> 01:35:06,440
You have to go do this right now.
And uh,

2368
01:35:06,590 --> 01:35:07,850
we,
we had security in everything,

2369
01:35:07,851 --> 01:35:10,250
but I remember you were really.
And then after the clips,

2370
01:35:10,251 --> 01:35:14,600
you'll see after they gave you the knife
and we were filing reports with the cops

2371
01:35:15,050 --> 01:35:15,860
at that point.
He goes,

2372
01:35:15,860 --> 01:35:17,550
I'm going to go back in.
I think it can really mess with him.

2373
01:35:17,551 --> 01:35:17,871
Like,
no,

2374
01:35:17,871 --> 01:35:20,420
you can't.
They just handed you a prison shank and

2375
01:35:20,421 --> 01:35:23,120
told you they had a sawed off shotgun.
You can't go back in there.

2376
01:35:23,121 --> 01:35:25,760
So once he was in it,
we had to rein him back.

2377
01:35:25,820 --> 01:35:30,270
It was like a little little jewelry a
couple times crazy.

2378
01:35:30,980 --> 01:35:32,900
A little crazy.
Okay.

2379
01:35:32,901 --> 01:35:34,210
So let's play this.
This is my meeting.

2380
01:35:36,170 --> 01:35:38,090
It's almost like product placement needs
a guy.

2381
01:35:38,360 --> 01:35:41,350
This is a guy I think.
Alright,

2382
01:35:41,360 --> 01:35:42,193
play it.

2383
01:35:46,270 --> 01:35:50,130
This is telling you how to show up.
Tactics

2384
01:35:52,120 --> 01:35:55,790
cannot prepare for what we're planning.
I have a toolbox full of shit.

2385
01:35:56,120 --> 01:35:57,620
Did you bring your gun on the border?

2386
01:36:07,140 --> 01:36:08,610
Yeah,
I thought so when I showed up this one.

2387
01:36:08,611 --> 01:36:13,611
But you know that Jamie is one where
they handed jared was an ice pick he

2388
01:36:13,891 --> 01:36:16,310
said or what was it?
It was an ice pick.

2389
01:36:16,530 --> 01:36:18,510
It.
It was a sharp point in but it was like

2390
01:36:18,630 --> 01:36:22,230
a screwdriver to Ak is coming.
Okay.

2391
01:36:22,231 --> 01:36:23,640
So here it is.
I think they were lying.

2392
01:36:25,520 --> 01:36:30,520
Excellent.
Tell me how like I can procure my own k

2393
01:36:31,020 --> 01:36:32,670
bars.
We go

2394
01:36:36,230 --> 01:36:38,950
five inches or so.
It's just you strap it on your leg.

2395
01:36:39,540 --> 01:36:40,980
Sponsor of Antifa.
Now by the way,

2396
01:36:43,060 --> 01:36:45,630
really shit down here.

2397
01:36:47,280 --> 01:36:49,080
Okay.
So what they're doing is,

2398
01:36:49,260 --> 01:36:51,720
first of all,
that person never stabbed anybody in

2399
01:36:51,721 --> 01:36:52,680
their fucking life.
Right?

2400
01:36:52,681 --> 01:36:56,010
So these are dorks and what they're
doing is they're deciding now they're

2401
01:36:56,011 --> 01:37:00,420
going to take action and they're going
to enlist the aid of a bunch of other

2402
01:37:00,421 --> 01:37:03,030
people.
Did you think at that point in time like

2403
01:37:03,031 --> 01:37:06,990
maybe these people are looking for
suckers that are willing to do fucked up

2404
01:37:06,991 --> 01:37:10,260
shit for them stabbing anybody?
I absolutely.

2405
01:37:11,370 --> 01:37:12,570
When I showed up,
I met.

2406
01:37:12,600 --> 01:37:14,610
There was like four.
Then when I got there they were all

2407
01:37:14,611 --> 01:37:16,320
running late.
The socialists were all running late,

2408
01:37:17,280 --> 01:37:19,970
late
show time.

2409
01:37:20,320 --> 01:37:23,090
And one of them actually said a
sweetheart there.

2410
01:37:23,110 --> 01:37:24,300
Honeybee was like,
yeah,

2411
01:37:24,301 --> 01:37:27,630
that's the beauty of being unemployed.
I can just show up on time anywhere I

2412
01:37:27,631 --> 01:37:29,910
want.
And there is a silver lining I guess.

2413
01:37:30,250 --> 01:37:31,820
But just eating.
She was,

2414
01:37:32,150 --> 01:37:34,590
she was still late.
Oh she was.

2415
01:37:35,130 --> 01:37:35,881
So she.
Okay.

2416
01:37:35,881 --> 01:37:38,220
So I get there first I'm thinking,
okay,

2417
01:37:38,221 --> 01:37:41,130
this is a bus.
This is a really sad group of people

2418
01:37:41,190 --> 01:37:42,720
because I don't know about the weapons
at this point.

2419
01:37:42,721 --> 01:37:43,554
I just,
okay.

2420
01:37:43,930 --> 01:37:47,190
I'm expecting like forties guys in the,
what they call black block,

2421
01:37:47,310 --> 01:37:49,110
all black goggles,
everything.

2422
01:37:49,111 --> 01:37:51,390
And it just looks like a really sad
social club,

2423
01:37:51,750 --> 01:37:55,170
so like get there,
sit down for a bit and like three

2424
01:37:55,171 --> 01:37:55,980
minutes in you

2425
01:37:55,980 --> 01:37:57,870
start telling me they start passing me
stuff,

2426
01:37:58,020 --> 01:38:00,420
telling me everything you just saw and
I'm thinking,

2427
01:38:01,190 --> 01:38:03,220
oh my lord,
this is not,

2428
01:38:03,920 --> 01:38:06,290
I need to get out,
I need to get out,

2429
01:38:06,320 --> 01:38:09,630
I need to get out to me while I'm on the
other side of the school because Ben

2430
01:38:09,630 --> 01:38:11,750
Shapiro was being some of the other side
of the school and the adventure area.

2431
01:38:11,760 --> 01:38:14,490
So there are a lot of fans.
I'm kind of taking pictures and you

2432
01:38:14,500 --> 01:38:15,333
know,
I got,

2433
01:38:15,410 --> 01:38:17,420
got spotted some take of my phone if
everyone.

2434
01:38:17,530 --> 01:38:20,040
So let me just shut off my phone taking
pictures and let me just.

2435
01:38:20,130 --> 01:38:22,040
And I see it in jared,
like they're handing me knives.

2436
01:38:22,730 --> 01:38:25,980
What do I
like it out?

2437
01:38:25,981 --> 01:38:26,481
And like,
okay,

2438
01:38:26,481 --> 01:38:27,970
I knew I needed,
I needed a fast,

2439
01:38:28,460 --> 01:38:28,971
quick.
Yeah.

2440
01:38:28,971 --> 01:38:31,820
So I told them I had to take a dump and
I just left.

2441
01:38:33,470 --> 01:38:38,120
That was hilarious.
What the crazy thing about that is that

2442
01:38:38,300 --> 01:38:40,400
you bring us the footage.
So there are cops right there.

2443
01:38:40,730 --> 01:38:41,980
So we tell the cops,
because I'm like,

2444
01:38:41,981 --> 01:38:43,730
we've got to get him through this,
whatever it is,

2445
01:38:43,731 --> 01:38:47,470
quad or whatever they're talking about
Luke right here,

2446
01:38:48,820 --> 01:38:50,380
I think.
Oh yeah.

2447
01:38:50,530 --> 01:38:51,790
Oh,
that's it.

2448
01:38:53,840 --> 01:38:55,530
That's not playing.
Let's get corrupted.

2449
01:38:55,860 --> 01:38:57,370
File here.
Go around the circle.

2450
01:38:57,371 --> 01:38:59,470
And they were handing out sharp objects
to stab people with.

2451
01:38:59,471 --> 01:39:00,520
So they had someone come up with this
guy,

2452
01:39:00,521 --> 01:39:03,370
worked for local ones to take to late
night hosts,

2453
01:39:03,400 --> 01:39:06,510
comedians to find this out,
you know what I mean?

2454
01:39:06,890 --> 01:39:07,641
Look,
yes.

2455
01:39:07,641 --> 01:39:11,540
You just saw correctly even being shown
the footage in the presence of police

2456
01:39:11,541 --> 01:39:15,230
officers to confirm authenticity.
They walked away.

2457
01:39:15,560 --> 01:39:16,390
Also,
I should note,

2458
01:39:16,390 --> 01:39:19,010
this is from nightline.
That was on my podcast.

2459
01:39:19,600 --> 01:39:21,410
He knew about the footage and the whole
story too.

2460
01:39:21,500 --> 01:39:25,250
I like offered it to them and asked.
You mentioned you give us a brief spot

2461
01:39:25,251 --> 01:39:27,530
and when they actually put together
weeks later after I'd video to come out.

2462
01:39:27,531 --> 01:39:29,840
So he had to acknowledge it,
but he put together a small little brief

2463
01:39:29,841 --> 01:39:34,841
montage of our video that took place on
peaceful event was not without some

2464
01:39:35,421 --> 01:39:36,254
controversy.

2465
01:39:36,300 --> 01:39:38,660
So what happens is to me,
what's so crazy,

2466
01:39:38,661 --> 01:39:39,411
it's like,
again,

2467
01:39:39,411 --> 01:39:42,380
I offered it to the local guy,
people who do news,

2468
01:39:42,400 --> 01:39:43,430
you know,
April O'Neill,

2469
01:39:43,550 --> 01:39:45,290
they're not,
they want the exclusive.

2470
01:39:45,320 --> 01:39:45,891
I said,
hey man,

2471
01:39:45,891 --> 01:39:48,260
do you want this to run this?
Because you worked for ABC or local Fox

2472
01:39:48,261 --> 01:39:51,270
or something and you do an instagram
videos with five following the season.

2473
01:39:51,280 --> 01:39:53,300
Oh heart go up on a screen.
So I'm looking at.

2474
01:39:53,301 --> 01:39:54,380
I'm like,
I'm like,

2475
01:39:54,381 --> 01:39:55,370
listen man,
do you want this?

2476
01:39:55,580 --> 01:39:56,413
And he goes,
uh,

2477
01:39:56,550 --> 01:39:57,383
what is it?
Oh,

2478
01:39:57,460 --> 01:39:58,080
hold on,
this is,

2479
01:39:58,080 --> 01:40:02,390
we tell them exactly what we had and we
show them a cryptic app and I'm like,

2480
01:40:02,391 --> 01:40:04,280
hold on a second,
we're not here to police.

2481
01:40:04,340 --> 01:40:06,380
So we're showing it to him and he walks
away.

2482
01:40:07,080 --> 01:40:07,520
I'm like,
why?

2483
01:40:07,520 --> 01:40:07,981
He's like,
well,

2484
01:40:07,981 --> 01:40:09,050
I've got to do my job.
I'm like,

2485
01:40:09,110 --> 01:40:11,720
this isn't a part of your job,
this isn't.

2486
01:40:11,880 --> 01:40:14,230
He didn't think it was.
And that to me was in St.

2487
01:40:14,250 --> 01:40:17,600
we weren't looking for it necessarily a
school trying to get this as wide as

2488
01:40:17,601 --> 01:40:19,280
possible.
He had a rhyme going down the street

2489
01:40:19,281 --> 01:40:20,520
with her protest.
So he had to get.

2490
01:40:20,640 --> 01:40:21,800
Yeah,
that's what he did.

2491
01:40:21,801 --> 01:40:24,700
He was doing Internet mail.
You'll see people peacefully protesting

2492
01:40:24,701 --> 01:40:26,000
and like,
hold up his instagram,

2493
01:40:26,001 --> 01:40:26,721
hey,
hey Ho ho.

2494
01:40:26,721 --> 01:40:30,200
Donald trump sucks.
He just didn't have authority that he

2495
01:40:30,440 --> 01:40:32,180
was trying to have.
Didn't fit the narrative.

2496
01:40:32,360 --> 01:40:34,430
Same thing with a guy from nightline
didn't fit.

2497
01:40:34,460 --> 01:40:36,890
So the narrative was the anti trump
protesters,

2498
01:40:36,891 --> 01:40:39,590
which is what people were tuning into
the news for wasn't.

2499
01:40:39,680 --> 01:40:41,090
It wasn't a peaceful,
peaceful.

2500
01:40:41,480 --> 01:40:44,330
There were snipers on the roof tops for
that little Jew.

2501
01:40:44,331 --> 01:40:48,290
Ben Shapiro.
This was two weeks after.

2502
01:40:48,980 --> 01:40:49,860
He's a.
he's a smart man,

2503
01:40:49,861 --> 01:40:51,280
a little bastard I love,
but he's like,

2504
01:40:51,320 --> 01:40:52,760
I could see how he pisses people off.

2505
01:40:52,760 --> 01:40:54,260
But he's brilliant.
He's very,

2506
01:40:54,450 --> 01:40:57,470
very smart because my first lawyer
negotiating my contracts,

2507
01:40:57,490 --> 01:40:58,990
he wasn't even entertainment lawyers had
been.

2508
01:40:59,680 --> 01:41:02,890
You got a lot of vowels and your last
name and I have a contract with money at

2509
01:41:02,891 --> 01:41:04,000
play.
Can you help me with anything?

2510
01:41:04,120 --> 01:41:07,270
I think I can do it.
And that's how we became friends.

2511
01:41:07,271 --> 01:41:08,750
I was 18.
That's hilarious.

2512
01:41:08,751 --> 01:41:10,930
So this is this.
I mean this is the heat of the ANTIFA

2513
01:41:10,960 --> 01:41:12,550
fight.
Last summer I ran up to Berkeley,

2514
01:41:12,551 --> 01:41:16,930
they were really specifically about
antifa trying to downplay the violence

2515
01:41:16,931 --> 01:41:20,560
and the,
the undercurrent that I've seen given

2516
01:41:20,561 --> 01:41:22,660
that up,
they seem to have accepted the fact that

2517
01:41:22,661 --> 01:41:24,100
there's a lot of times,
some of them,

2518
01:41:24,101 --> 01:41:25,340
some of them,
but I think this,

2519
01:41:25,600 --> 01:41:29,110
I mean I hate not to toot our own horn,
but I think things like this and that

2520
01:41:29,111 --> 01:41:31,540
got what 15 million plays on facebook
and a few million on,

2521
01:41:31,840 --> 01:41:32,290
on,
uh,

2522
01:41:32,290 --> 01:41:32,740
on Youtube.

2523
01:41:32,740 --> 01:41:34,990
And the reason we got more mileage
because the news refused to cover it.

2524
01:41:34,991 --> 01:41:37,330
And then was it the dean?
Someone.

2525
01:41:37,331 --> 01:41:40,240
There's some student activities advisor
released the official statement saying

2526
01:41:40,241 --> 01:41:42,310
nothing happened.
And so we called him.

2527
01:41:42,520 --> 01:41:46,600
So that was a followup call member
listening to a Washington,

2528
01:41:46,630 --> 01:41:48,760
what we made up something Washington
Harold or something.

2529
01:41:48,761 --> 01:41:49,211
She was like,
oh,

2530
01:41:49,211 --> 01:41:50,640
it was a really stupid name.
I know what it was.

2531
01:41:50,650 --> 01:41:53,050
And we asked who made the statement that
this was entirely peaceful because

2532
01:41:53,051 --> 01:41:54,790
honeybee.
He said he's speaking on behalf of the

2533
01:41:54,791 --> 01:41:57,790
police but never actually quoted a name.
So he was,

2534
01:41:58,150 --> 01:42:01,140
we figured out very quickly he's
speaking on behalf of himself and he was

2535
01:42:01,180 --> 01:42:03,070
opinions.
We found out he was actually a delegate

2536
01:42:03,130 --> 01:42:04,730
or some.
She was actually officially involved

2537
01:42:04,731 --> 01:42:05,880
with holistic statement.
Yeah.

2538
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:06,940
Ties to Clinton.
He was,

2539
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:10,990
he was a Clinton staffer,
supportive and for this like open,

2540
01:42:10,991 --> 01:42:11,530
supportive.

2541
01:42:11,530 --> 01:42:13,410
And it's very confusing.
It's like,

2542
01:42:13,810 --> 01:42:16,010
do you know this?
You've got like professors hitting

2543
01:42:16,011 --> 01:42:19,150
people in the head with bike locks.
Like this sounds absurd,

2544
01:42:19,151 --> 01:42:20,950
but it's true.
It's not a wise group.

2545
01:42:20,980 --> 01:42:25,540
This is nuts.
This is not a smartly organized refusal

2546
01:42:25,600 --> 01:42:28,810
of some crazy power structure.
These are.

2547
01:42:28,960 --> 01:42:30,400
This is chaos,
right?

2548
01:42:30,450 --> 01:42:31,510
It's your question earlier.
Yeah,

2549
01:42:31,511 --> 01:42:35,140
I do think they were.
I think they prey on losers of society

2550
01:42:35,200 --> 01:42:38,320
to become part of that.
There were so quick to welcome me in

2551
01:42:38,890 --> 01:42:42,010
because they need the numbers and
they're willing to accept anybody.

2552
01:42:42,050 --> 01:42:45,490
There was no filtration system.
I've got to say that if that was a real

2553
01:42:46,390 --> 01:42:48,490
faction of anti,
that's the sad.

2554
01:42:48,491 --> 01:42:50,790
It's fucking faction that that doesn't
matter.

2555
01:42:51,140 --> 01:42:53,590
Case and you're,
you're as bad as anybody tell them later

2556
01:42:53,591 --> 01:42:56,190
that.
So Honeybee got arrested for tasting

2557
01:42:56,191 --> 01:42:57,730
your guy,
tasing a guy the same.

2558
01:42:59,420 --> 01:43:02,620
Who she taze know the guy sucker punched
a different guy.

2559
01:43:03,230 --> 01:43:04,480
Something happened.
There was a desktop.

2560
01:43:06,230 --> 01:43:07,740
Are you dot gender?
No,

2561
01:43:07,910 --> 01:43:08,743
God,
I would never do that.

2562
01:43:09,250 --> 01:43:10,540
Never.
Honeybee was actually,

2563
01:43:10,541 --> 01:43:12,820
they're not my character.
Honeybee was the late socialist.

2564
01:43:13,450 --> 01:43:18,450
Got Arrested for chasing the dude.
And then after jail was texting.

2565
01:43:19,001 --> 01:43:21,100
You remember that she wanted her knife
back.

2566
01:43:21,250 --> 01:43:23,800
Oh my God.
Does she know the picture?

2567
01:43:24,440 --> 01:43:26,890
Because I texted a picture of me sitting
next to two Shapiro.

2568
01:43:26,891 --> 01:43:28,630
Full getup.
Flipping them the bird.

2569
01:43:28,810 --> 01:43:31,600
You texted them a picture in the crypto
in encryption APP.

2570
01:43:32,020 --> 01:43:36,030
Oh my God.
I should've brought the phone to give me

2571
01:43:36,031 --> 01:43:37,750
the knife back.
I remember the cops who were like,

2572
01:43:37,780 --> 01:43:39,190
you bastard.
Give me the knife.

2573
01:43:39,200 --> 01:43:42,630
So next it just says thumbs up.
Oh my God.

2574
01:43:43,160 --> 01:43:45,040
We told them like when it was going up
on youtube,

2575
01:43:45,041 --> 01:43:47,680
like keep an eye out tomorrow at 6:00 on
Youtube.

2576
01:43:47,860 --> 01:43:49,750
So she gets arrested for tasing
somebody.

2577
01:43:49,810 --> 01:43:50,300
Yeah.
Yeah.

2578
01:43:50,300 --> 01:43:52,160
Then what happens now?
No heat

2579
01:43:52,160 --> 01:43:54,590
for her.
For all this video of her saying she's

2580
01:43:54,591 --> 01:43:57,070
got a handgun and we don't know we,
I mean,

2581
01:43:57,540 --> 01:43:59,960
can we say now we.
I was in a lot of phone calls with,

2582
01:44:00,010 --> 01:44:03,110
with the FBI,
obs on the premise with the FBI and they

2583
01:44:03,111 --> 01:44:08,111
knew that my footage was not terribly
surprising to any of them because they

2584
01:44:09,111 --> 01:44:11,720
were all already on their radar,
but they did ask how you got into

2585
01:44:11,721 --> 01:44:12,790
cryptic APP.
They did that.

2586
01:44:12,830 --> 01:44:17,390
They were picking my brain for how they
function because they are organized to a

2587
01:44:17,391 --> 01:44:19,880
certain extent.
I mean if there is ignored as organized

2588
01:44:19,881 --> 01:44:22,310
as the Berkeley faction or as any other
faction,

2589
01:44:22,311 --> 01:44:23,780
that's called trouble,
who knows,

2590
01:44:24,110 --> 01:44:28,160
but to some level they are and that's
where the FBI used us to to kind of help

2591
01:44:28,161 --> 01:44:29,240
them.
What's what we were talking about

2592
01:44:29,241 --> 01:44:32,240
earlier that my.
My take on it is that if you're trying

2593
01:44:32,241 --> 01:44:36,860
to suppress people that hardcore and
it's just a guy who's talking and net

2594
01:44:36,861 --> 01:44:39,770
guy turns out to be Ben Shapiro and
you're calling him a Nazi,

2595
01:44:40,130 --> 01:44:41,960
like,
do you see those dangerous in?

2596
01:44:42,070 --> 01:44:44,060
They called.
You see the Yarmulke on his head?

2597
01:44:44,240 --> 01:44:46,100
Yeah.
Ben Shapiro's and Nazi,

2598
01:44:46,110 --> 01:44:48,470
are you out of your mind like this is
you,

2599
01:44:48,471 --> 01:44:53,420
you're so far gone that you like with
every single one of these things,

2600
01:44:53,421 --> 01:44:56,750
it diminishes the credibility of this.
This whole movement,

2601
01:44:56,930 --> 01:44:58,970
like the whole thing just seemed
preposterous.

2602
01:44:58,971 --> 01:45:02,960
Like you're calling everybody a Nazi.
Even a Jewish guy with a Yamaka on.

2603
01:45:02,990 --> 01:45:05,330
He's a Nazi because he's a white
supremacist.

2604
01:45:05,331 --> 01:45:08,090
Tells you how the fuck is you,
what you listen to what he's saying.

2605
01:45:08,390 --> 01:45:09,980
He's not a white supremacist.
He's a.

2606
01:45:10,070 --> 01:45:13,490
he's a conservative and if you don't
think that he's correct,

2607
01:45:13,520 --> 01:45:14,870
go debate him.
Well.

2608
01:45:14,880 --> 01:45:16,970
It's probably goes racist.
Wasn't good enough.

2609
01:45:17,090 --> 01:45:19,980
Calling him a bigot wasn't good at.
They just escalated to okay,

2610
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,430
well not to get your intention in
escalates that way.

2611
01:45:22,431 --> 01:45:25,820
I know what's happened to Jordan
Peterson and with a woman who had

2612
01:45:25,821 --> 01:45:29,870
recorded the conversation between the
professors that were chastising her for

2613
01:45:29,871 --> 01:45:30,290
showing.

2614
01:45:30,290 --> 01:45:35,090
Just showing a clip of Jordan Peterson
discussing gender pronouns and the

2615
01:45:35,120 --> 01:45:38,690
professors equated her are equated him
to Hitler.

2616
01:45:38,840 --> 01:45:42,290
They literally equated Jordan Peterson
to Hitler and Milo Yiannopoulos,

2617
01:45:42,350 --> 01:45:44,920
which is a big spectrum.
Annapolis hit.

2618
01:45:44,921 --> 01:45:45,750
Well,
not only that,

2619
01:45:45,750 --> 01:45:48,620
only Nautilus Ben Shapiro,
there are no two people who hated each

2620
01:45:48,621 --> 01:45:50,120
other more,
you know what I mean?

2621
01:45:50,121 --> 01:45:52,390
And they're just like all writers.
I mean Milo Yiannopoulos and Benji

2622
01:45:52,391 --> 01:45:54,170
apparently.
Do you realize how much they despise

2623
01:45:54,171 --> 01:45:58,130
each 2016.
Ben Shapiro was the number one recipient

2624
01:45:58,131 --> 01:46:00,570
of antisemitic hate online.
Number one.

2625
01:46:00,590 --> 01:46:01,670
It doesn't surprise me.
I mean,

2626
01:46:01,671 --> 01:46:06,671
that's how crazy it is to call a Nazi.
He's Super Jewish to get Jewish as it

2627
01:46:08,831 --> 01:46:09,664
gets.
I don't even,

2628
01:46:09,680 --> 01:46:11,810
I don't even send them texts if we're
getting near Saturday.

2629
01:46:13,510 --> 01:46:15,530
He's like,
you know,

2630
01:46:15,560 --> 01:46:18,000
they do the shaving thing where you can
use an electric trimmer in one port in a

2631
01:46:18,001 --> 01:46:18,834
straight razor.
I'm like,

2632
01:46:19,270 --> 01:46:19,550
okay.

2633
01:46:19,550 --> 01:46:21,310
So logical and every other way.
Like,

2634
01:46:21,660 --> 01:46:23,180
oh,
he's so hardcore with that.

2635
01:46:23,181 --> 01:46:25,010
It's so strange.
I love to talk to them about that.

2636
01:46:25,560 --> 01:46:28,790
Such as Jewish,
just so hardcore with velocity.

2637
01:46:29,360 --> 01:46:33,440
Velocity is that
Ben and I had been friends for a long,

2638
01:46:33,441 --> 01:46:34,400
long time.
And,

2639
01:46:34,401 --> 01:46:36,100
um,
I think even when I was on the show it

2640
01:46:36,101 --> 01:46:36,501
was like,
you know,

2641
01:46:36,501 --> 01:46:39,440
listen to it,
but I've never planned to be a debate or

2642
01:46:39,450 --> 01:46:42,020
it just kind of was thrust upon me.
Sometimes we have people on the show.

2643
01:46:42,710 --> 01:46:45,080
I think I'm a marginally intelligent
person.

2644
01:46:45,081 --> 01:46:48,860
Ben Shapiro was brilliant.
It just kind of took a while for people

2645
01:46:48,861 --> 01:46:50,520
to find them.
I think on the show is I get Ben as a

2646
01:46:50,521 --> 01:46:53,920
kind of guy if you want to talk about
this and really have someone who goes in

2647
01:46:53,921 --> 01:46:55,710
the lion's den and he just,
he just doesn't care.

2648
01:46:56,040 --> 01:46:56,880
He just does not care.

2649
01:46:56,880 --> 01:46:58,690
He's not afraid of any.
He wasn't afraid of,

2650
01:46:58,750 --> 01:47:01,530
of Milo during that time when listening,
taking consideration.

2651
01:47:01,531 --> 01:47:02,640
Ben Shapiro during this time,
right?

2652
01:47:02,990 --> 01:47:05,310
Ben Shapiro Leaves Breitbart.
They're smearing his name.

2653
01:47:05,311 --> 01:47:07,890
He doesn't like Steve Bannon.
And this is well known.

2654
01:47:08,200 --> 01:47:10,560
Um,
Breitbart is really powerful.

2655
01:47:10,561 --> 01:47:12,660
Steve Bannon is getting cozy with Donald
trump.

2656
01:47:12,661 --> 01:47:16,200
Ben Shapiro can't stand Donald Trump.
Milo Yiannopoulos is the most popular

2657
01:47:16,201 --> 01:47:18,600
right wing sort of commentator and he's
going after Ben.

2658
01:47:18,870 --> 01:47:22,680
Like there was a period where I'm sure
it was pretty rough for him and he still

2659
01:47:22,681 --> 01:47:25,240
stuck to his guns.
You've got to respect that guy.

2660
01:47:25,300 --> 01:47:26,580
No,
I and I like him.

2661
01:47:26,790 --> 01:47:28,470
He's a very nice guy.
I had him on the show.

2662
01:47:28,471 --> 01:47:31,140
Had a great time talking to him.
I think he's a very nice guy,

2663
01:47:31,141 --> 01:47:34,950
very smart guy.
I feel like there's something happening

2664
01:47:34,951 --> 01:47:38,700
right now culturally be so many people
that are freaking out because Donald

2665
01:47:38,700 --> 01:47:42,630
Trump is the president that everything
is ramped up and no one can be left wing

2666
01:47:42,631 --> 01:47:46,410
enough and I think this is probably one
of the reasons why someone would justify

2667
01:47:46,740 --> 01:47:51,740
having an article like that pedophile
thing on salon.com and why people just.

2668
01:47:51,900 --> 01:47:55,710
It seems to be that like you can't be
progressive enough like everything is

2669
01:47:55,711 --> 01:48:00,270
getting so over the top and so
ridiculous that people are calling other

2670
01:48:00,271 --> 01:48:02,840
progressive's out for not being
progressive enough and it's.

2671
01:48:03,270 --> 01:48:05,480
They're eating their own.
The pussy hat thing have you that?

2672
01:48:05,930 --> 01:48:06,481
Yes.
Yes.

2673
01:48:06,481 --> 01:48:09,760
The transgender community is very upset
that you are and you,

2674
01:48:09,780 --> 01:48:13,080
if you are a white woman wearing a pussy
hat,

2675
01:48:13,260 --> 01:48:17,670
you are mocking people that are women
that don't have policies,

2676
01:48:18,150 --> 01:48:21,570
specifically black women and black women
because black women's.

2677
01:48:21,960 --> 01:48:24,000
Well,
I mean like maybe you've seen a couple

2678
01:48:24,600 --> 01:48:29,550
but don't say always because that that
is just wrong internally.

2679
01:48:29,580 --> 01:48:30,690
Yeah.
You don't know.

2680
01:48:30,930 --> 01:48:31,621
Who knows.
Okay,

2681
01:48:31,621 --> 01:48:32,940
I'll give you that and just taking the
bus.

2682
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:36,090
I spoke out of turn.
Some of them are dark,

2683
01:48:37,080 --> 01:48:41,370
but the point is like that's how crazy
the left wing has gotten like that.

2684
01:48:41,370 --> 01:48:46,370
Wearing a pink pussy hat is offensive
because it's offensive to people who are

2685
01:48:46,951 --> 01:48:48,630
women who have penises.
Yeah.

2686
01:48:48,840 --> 01:48:52,890
Literally that's what they said.
And people of color who also don't have

2687
01:48:52,891 --> 01:48:54,450
pink pussy,
so like fuck you.

2688
01:48:54,990 --> 01:48:57,810
Like pink is obviously a universal color
for women.

2689
01:48:58,100 --> 01:48:59,850
You're wearing a hat.
It's got cat ears.

2690
01:48:59,910 --> 01:49:01,080
Get it,
get it.

2691
01:49:01,110 --> 01:49:02,910
It's not a vagina.
You fuck.

2692
01:49:03,330 --> 01:49:05,390
It's not like give a goddamn vagina on
your hat.

2693
01:49:05,410 --> 01:49:09,050
And some people did.
Some people did say insurance.

2694
01:49:09,090 --> 01:49:09,661
Bitterness.
We actually,

2695
01:49:09,661 --> 01:49:11,490
we just didn't have the budget because
lansing was really.

2696
01:49:11,491 --> 01:49:12,870
They were actually,
I think it was lansing,

2697
01:49:12,871 --> 01:49:14,300
Michigan,
one of the places had like abandoned the

2698
01:49:14,380 --> 01:49:16,730
pussyhat,
so we just want to show up with fitbit.

2699
01:49:16,890 --> 01:49:17,491
What?
Yeah,

2700
01:49:17,491 --> 01:49:18,201
there was one.
I don't,

2701
01:49:18,201 --> 01:49:20,940
I don't wanna speak out of turn on and
off with land place out of van someplace

2702
01:49:20,941 --> 01:49:23,370
was like,
we just actively discourage it and we

2703
01:49:23,371 --> 01:49:27,360
just wanted to show up with 50 guys who
were like hardcore feminist that I'm

2704
01:49:27,370 --> 01:49:29,280
against,
that I'm on their side.

2705
01:49:30,360 --> 01:49:32,550
Shows you that people in Pussy hats and
like what?

2706
01:49:32,580 --> 01:49:33,770
We didn't know,
but wait a minute,

2707
01:49:34,180 --> 01:49:36,360
but it's all the socialists pay for new
hats.

2708
01:49:36,361 --> 01:49:39,720
They just bought them last year.
Fight in these cat hats.

2709
01:49:39,721 --> 01:49:42,060
It's not like a vagina.
It's a cat.

2710
01:49:43,530 --> 01:49:45,750
It is,
but you can't have a double entendre

2711
01:49:45,751 --> 01:49:48,310
publicly.
You explain that to your kid.

2712
01:49:48,580 --> 01:49:49,630
What's going on?
They're dead.

2713
01:49:49,930 --> 01:49:52,900
A little fella that's a,
they like cats.

2714
01:49:53,830 --> 01:49:55,660
How hard is that?
Why are they screaming?

2715
01:49:55,661 --> 01:49:59,800
You shouldn't touch my pussy,
your puberty blockers and shut up.

2716
01:50:00,920 --> 01:50:01,950
It's crazy.
I mean,

2717
01:50:02,010 --> 01:50:04,630
I remember when that happened.
It was right after the women's March and

2718
01:50:04,631 --> 01:50:05,620
you and I were talking about,
um,

2719
01:50:05,621 --> 01:50:08,940
we were kind of talking a at that point
where we're sort of analyzing our idea,

2720
01:50:08,950 --> 01:50:11,380
put the economics and the wage gap and
we're talking about this and why that

2721
01:50:11,381 --> 01:50:14,560
wasn't necessarily true.
Now we're still beyond that.

2722
01:50:14,561 --> 01:50:19,280
I just go look at it thrown hats.
That's,

2723
01:50:19,870 --> 01:50:21,970
that's a joke for the night of the show.
That's it.

2724
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:25,270
That really is it.
They're so crazy.

2725
01:50:25,271 --> 01:50:29,680
Left wing progressive over the top,
attacking each other that you can't wear

2726
01:50:29,681 --> 01:50:31,860
a pussy hat anymore.
But who defends it is my point,

2727
01:50:31,870 --> 01:50:35,890
like let's say like an experian or
Shanker who I'm just using them as an

2728
01:50:35,891 --> 01:50:36,724
example.

2729
01:50:37,120 --> 01:50:40,050
It would be who of them to go on air,
right?

2730
01:50:40,051 --> 01:50:41,350
It might say,
this is really,

2731
01:50:41,380 --> 01:50:42,760
this is why the left loses.
Right?

2732
01:50:42,761 --> 01:50:44,260
Because now you're upset about the pussy
hats.

2733
01:50:44,270 --> 01:50:46,360
And we mentioned like instead they go
along with it.

2734
01:50:46,520 --> 01:50:47,800
Yeah.
No,

2735
01:50:48,450 --> 01:50:49,690
we really should have caught that
earlier.

2736
01:50:49,691 --> 01:50:52,210
You know,
a point they got a point we should have

2737
01:50:52,211 --> 01:50:53,320
cut.
I understand that,

2738
01:50:53,321 --> 01:50:54,190
you know,
people who are.

2739
01:50:54,400 --> 01:50:54,951
It's just like,
it's,

2740
01:50:54,951 --> 01:50:55,784
it's,
it's a,

2741
01:50:55,870 --> 01:50:58,540
it's a cat and a vagina,
but it's,

2742
01:50:58,541 --> 01:51:00,370
you can't make fun of anything.
I mean,

2743
01:51:00,371 --> 01:51:02,050
they're there.
They're in this weird position where it

2744
01:51:02,051 --> 01:51:04,030
fits a left wing thing.
You can't make fun of it.

2745
01:51:04,060 --> 01:51:06,670
Even if it's like obviously ridiculous,
you just ignore it.

2746
01:51:06,980 --> 01:51:11,170
You ignore it and avoid it because to
mock it would be to attack your own team

2747
01:51:11,500 --> 01:51:13,300
and that that's what it feels like to
me,

2748
01:51:13,470 --> 01:51:14,680
their own shrinking deal.

2749
01:51:15,010 --> 01:51:18,150
This is just,
this is totally just me kind of asking,

2750
01:51:18,370 --> 01:51:20,170
throwing this to the room and maybe to
usually

2751
01:51:21,680 --> 01:51:23,790
I'm just asking questions.
Um,

2752
01:51:24,640 --> 01:51:27,490
black lives matter,
Antifa the pussy.

2753
01:51:27,850 --> 01:51:30,070
It's kind of all disappeared a little
bit.

2754
01:51:31,230 --> 01:51:32,620
You think about it.
Think about the news.

2755
01:51:32,650 --> 01:51:35,650
They're really not very active.
It's been like a couple of months you

2756
01:51:35,651 --> 01:51:38,400
think of how exponentially volatile
everything want us.

2757
01:51:38,450 --> 01:51:40,290
Right?
It doesn't seem like it's kind of

2758
01:51:40,300 --> 01:51:41,133
fierce,
I think.

2759
01:51:41,140 --> 01:51:46,140
I think it's faded because it's proof
that these huge grass root movement,

2760
01:51:46,871 --> 01:51:48,930
I think they ran out of budget.
I think spend it that,

2761
01:51:49,630 --> 01:51:51,450
I hate to say it,
but when we were talking about the

2762
01:51:51,460 --> 01:51:54,580
women's March and it was like at that
point they were saying the biggest march

2763
01:51:54,581 --> 01:51:56,260
of all time said,
watch,

2764
01:51:56,380 --> 01:51:57,580
watch,
watch the next one.

2765
01:51:57,581 --> 01:51:59,080
The next one we went to Denton,
Texas.

2766
01:51:59,320 --> 01:52:01,840
You couldn't find 40 people because they
were paid to show up.

2767
01:52:01,900 --> 01:52:03,310
It's like the sea,
the fight for 15.

2768
01:52:03,510 --> 01:52:05,110
The are these leftist organizing?
Denton,

2769
01:52:05,111 --> 01:52:06,910
Texas and La was giant.
No,

2770
01:52:06,911 --> 01:52:08,410
no.
The women's march was huge everywhere,

2771
01:52:08,470 --> 01:52:11,140
but the point is they did a follow up
march and there was no one.

2772
01:52:11,170 --> 01:52:14,290
When you don't pay people to show up and
you're not knitting the hats and given

2773
01:52:14,291 --> 01:52:15,190
them out,
no one shows up.

2774
01:52:15,410 --> 01:52:16,540
What?
But where though?

2775
01:52:16,570 --> 01:52:17,650
In Denton Texas.
No,

2776
01:52:17,750 --> 01:52:18,670
everywhere.
La.

2777
01:52:18,671 --> 01:52:20,800
They weren't paying people.
Oh yeah,

2778
01:52:21,760 --> 01:52:22,960
absoluTely.
Absolutely.

2779
01:52:22,961 --> 01:52:27,520
You think they were paying was something
like 900,000 thousand people downtown.

2780
01:52:27,930 --> 01:52:30,500
There were a lot of big.
Give them a dollar and have them spend.

2781
01:52:30,910 --> 01:52:32,650
I think what's a half a million dollar
budget.

2782
01:52:32,651 --> 01:52:34,400
Everyone who works for a leftist think
tank.

2783
01:52:34,690 --> 01:52:36,280
Everyone who works for a leftist,
nonprofit,

2784
01:52:36,730 --> 01:52:39,610
everyone who works for the fciu or as a
part of the union,

2785
01:52:39,910 --> 01:52:42,730
this now becomes a part of your job
description to show up in solidarity and

2786
01:52:42,731 --> 01:52:44,650
support them.
It's the same reason they support antifa

2787
01:52:44,651 --> 01:52:46,010
even though it's silly and they support
black

2788
01:52:46,010 --> 01:52:47,900
lives.
Not think you're right about that.

2789
01:52:47,901 --> 01:52:50,840
I think there's a lot of people that
love to march.

2790
01:52:50,841 --> 01:52:54,380
They lOve a some sort of a cause.
They think they're doing the right

2791
01:52:54,381 --> 01:52:56,090
thing.
They think they're out there protesting.

2792
01:52:56,091 --> 01:52:58,160
They get excited about it.
It's on a saturday.

2793
01:52:58,550 --> 01:53:00,020
I don't think any of these people are
getting paid.

2794
01:53:00,320 --> 01:53:02,450
These people are excited about it.
They're out there.

2795
01:53:02,451 --> 01:53:06,480
They're chanting and cheering and this
is what they want to stand proud and be

2796
01:53:06,890 --> 01:53:08,720
solidified,
and two weeks later,

2797
01:53:08,721 --> 01:53:10,580
none of them show up.
What do you mean?

2798
01:53:10,860 --> 01:53:12,530
If there were many women's marches after
that?

2799
01:53:12,531 --> 01:53:14,930
The follow up.
Nothing like you look at the tea party

2800
01:53:14,931 --> 01:53:17,600
when it started there was to do one.
You don't have to keep going all over

2801
01:53:17,601 --> 01:53:18,780
the course.
Anyway.

2802
01:53:18,920 --> 01:53:21,790
Twentieth,
that's 10 days ago this.

2803
01:53:21,980 --> 01:53:23,000
Oh,
this is the recent one.

2804
01:53:23,290 --> 01:53:25,820
Yeah,
it's like every.

2805
01:53:25,820 --> 01:53:27,710
They do it once a year.
They can gather their troops.

2806
01:53:27,890 --> 01:53:29,310
I think you crazy.
No,

2807
01:53:29,600 --> 01:53:32,150
I don't think we signed it for the fight
for 15.

2808
01:53:32,690 --> 01:53:34,110
What's that?
The sea.

2809
01:53:34,111 --> 01:53:36,170
You were on all the mailing lists,
so we're on all the mailing lists as to

2810
01:53:36,171 --> 01:53:38,870
where these things meet and win the
fight for 15.

2811
01:53:38,871 --> 01:53:40,730
Was that a hashtag fight for 15?
What does that mean?

2812
01:53:40,970 --> 01:53:45,470
That's the fight for 15 minimum wage
minimum wage thing.

2813
01:53:45,950 --> 01:53:48,230
Same thing with the women's marches.
Remember when we showed up and we asked

2814
01:53:48,231 --> 01:53:51,470
them the ones outside of the big.
The only people who were there were paid

2815
01:53:51,570 --> 01:53:53,030
I'd speakers.
Okay.

2816
01:53:53,031 --> 01:53:54,670
Well that's different.
Okay.

2817
01:53:54,680 --> 01:53:57,050
That's a different march,
but I think the women's march is pretty

2818
01:53:57,051 --> 01:53:58,550
legit.
I think these people are doing it

2819
01:53:58,551 --> 01:54:01,070
because they don't like having this guy
in power.

2820
01:54:01,370 --> 01:54:03,200
They wAnted a woman is.
There's two things going on.

2821
01:54:03,200 --> 01:54:04,700
One,
they wanted a woman to be president.

2822
01:54:04,740 --> 01:54:07,880
They thought a woman was going to be
president and then it was snatched from

2823
01:54:08,030 --> 01:54:09,850
snatched,
snatched,

2824
01:54:10,290 --> 01:54:14,030
snatched away,
and so in a hat and framework.

2825
01:54:14,031 --> 01:54:17,570
Then now he's.
He's just a fucking crazy guy,

2826
01:54:17,790 --> 01:54:21,590
like donald trump's a crazy guy,
but he's going to be a crazy guy the

2827
01:54:21,590 --> 01:54:23,150
next month when you're doing another
protest,

2828
01:54:23,151 --> 01:54:25,730
but no one shows up.
They think somehow or another that it's

2829
01:54:25,731 --> 01:54:27,410
gonna have an impact.
It doesn't.

2830
01:54:27,620 --> 01:54:30,050
It does culturally,
like people are aware of it,

2831
01:54:30,200 --> 01:54:31,980
but it doesn't have any impact on him.
I don't think.

2832
01:54:31,990 --> 01:54:33,530
Most don't even know what theY want said
no,

2833
01:54:33,560 --> 01:54:35,690
no.
What they want to impact on find his

2834
01:54:35,691 --> 01:54:38,240
tweet because it was god damned
hilarious about the women's march,

2835
01:54:38,241 --> 01:54:39,470
about what a wonderful day.

2836
01:54:44,250 --> 01:54:45,990
Those are the moments where things like
maybe years,

2837
01:54:46,400 --> 01:54:49,270
silverware.
You look at pro life marches.

2838
01:54:49,280 --> 01:54:51,890
He thinks hundreds of thousands of all
the time,

2839
01:54:52,280 --> 01:54:53,480
all the time.
Here it is.

2840
01:54:53,720 --> 01:54:58,070
Trump tweets in support of women's march
that's also protesting him.

2841
01:54:58,480 --> 01:55:00,300
Go to the tweet.
What was it

2842
01:55:02,450 --> 01:55:04,840
all over the country?
Let's say depression.

2843
01:55:05,260 --> 01:55:07,790
Go ahead.
Get out there to celebrate the historic

2844
01:55:07,791 --> 01:55:09,500
bauhaus.
Delegation had precedent and economic

2845
01:55:09,501 --> 01:55:12,590
success and wealth creation that has
taken place over the last 12 months

2846
01:55:13,110 --> 01:55:15,470
because I was female and employment at
18 years.

2847
01:55:15,471 --> 01:55:17,480
Come on.
That's fucking funny.

2848
01:55:17,481 --> 01:55:18,380
Man.
I don't give a shit,

2849
01:55:19,670 --> 01:55:21,700
I don't care if you're a supporter or if
you're.

2850
01:55:21,740 --> 01:55:23,870
If you're a person who appreciates
comedy,

2851
01:55:24,140 --> 01:55:26,870
that's fucking strong troll and that's,
you know,

2852
01:55:26,900 --> 01:55:28,730
how many whip trolley,
what's her name?

2853
01:55:28,790 --> 01:55:31,040
Truly puff puff,
you know,

2854
01:55:31,041 --> 01:55:36,041
of any of them were citizens who just
fucking screaming how many.

2855
01:55:36,730 --> 01:55:39,230
A lot of sites that have live punched
into laptops.

2856
01:55:39,740 --> 01:55:41,990
People were angry at that.
That was hilarious.

2857
01:55:41,991 --> 01:55:44,100
When we went to the about the marches or
the

2858
01:55:44,220 --> 01:55:47,420
protests we went to in grand rapids,
the socialist march,

2859
01:55:47,421 --> 01:55:47,870
we,
we,

2860
01:55:47,870 --> 01:55:51,050
we ambulatory market is being really big
markets.

2861
01:55:51,540 --> 01:55:55,320
But to your point that they were.
They were pissed off that the students

2862
01:55:55,321 --> 01:55:59,470
who were like a lot of people just
therefore the movement were pissed off

2863
01:55:59,471 --> 01:56:01,790
that the union people didn't show up and
this is what's coming in the busloads,

2864
01:56:01,890 --> 01:56:05,010
the union workers and didn't show where
the people paid by the organization.

2865
01:56:05,011 --> 01:56:07,860
And that's one thing we found.
so like the Utah antifa and the reason

2866
01:56:07,861 --> 01:56:10,620
we say this is every time we show up,
we found it actually from a leftist

2867
01:56:10,621 --> 01:56:13,860
activist group.
It's about what do we average a twelfth

2868
01:56:13,861 --> 01:56:15,780
of the people who say they're interested
in going,

2869
01:56:16,060 --> 01:56:17,760
oh yeah,
someone like a twelfth,

2870
01:56:17,761 --> 01:56:19,010
like reggie came up with a number.
He's like,

2871
01:56:19,011 --> 01:56:20,760
if they like facebook and they don't
really have to show up.

2872
01:56:20,790 --> 01:56:22,650
Yeah.
If 120 18 we'll say attending,

2873
01:56:23,040 --> 01:56:25,740
it'll be.
It'll be like eight and it's this

2874
01:56:25,741 --> 01:56:29,310
consistent to the point where we have to
determine what events we go to or what

2875
01:56:29,311 --> 01:56:32,400
is funny enough to cover because even if
it will say a few thousand people are

2876
01:56:32,401 --> 01:56:34,500
going to a march,
inevitably it's far,

2877
01:56:34,501 --> 01:56:36,750
far less to run through the bullshit
agora algorithms do.

2878
01:56:36,751 --> 01:56:39,990
We've had so many.
Does This depend on where you're talking

2879
01:56:39,991 --> 01:56:41,670
about like if you're in lansing,
Michigan,

2880
01:56:41,671 --> 01:56:42,870
maybe,
but if you're in la,

2881
01:56:42,871 --> 01:56:45,780
these marches or while you're in la now,
but there are some.

2882
01:56:45,781 --> 01:56:47,700
But for every one that you see that the
media says,

2883
01:56:47,701 --> 01:56:49,110
okay,
we're gonna you know this is all hands

2884
01:56:49,111 --> 01:56:51,630
on deck.
there are 40 no one shows up.

2885
01:56:52,080 --> 01:56:54,570
You know we had that even in New York
city with the fight for 15.

2886
01:56:54,600 --> 01:56:57,150
And we sense though,
I mean how many times can you get people

2887
01:56:57,151 --> 01:56:57,984
to march?

2888
01:56:58,170 --> 01:57:00,030
Well,
not even show up for any protests.

2889
01:57:00,290 --> 01:57:02,130
You know how many times you can get
people to protest.

2890
01:57:02,131 --> 01:57:05,490
I mean you can only get a few of those
out of a person in a year.

2891
01:57:05,580 --> 01:57:07,980
You disagree.
You think people are just down to do it

2892
01:57:07,981 --> 01:57:10,110
all the time.
Everything was hundreds of thousands.

2893
01:57:10,230 --> 01:57:11,970
Like every other month.
Like clockwork.

2894
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:14,250
And then they won an election.
That's different though.

2895
01:57:14,890 --> 01:57:16,710
The yj 20 group.
Oh yeah,

2896
01:57:16,711 --> 01:57:18,240
the Hawaii.
That was another thing we got kicked out

2897
01:57:18,241 --> 01:57:19,790
of the hawaiian [inaudible] group.
J,

2898
01:57:19,800 --> 01:57:21,230
j.
J 20 slash 20.

2899
01:57:21,270 --> 01:57:21,930
I don't know.
It was an undercover.

2900
01:57:21,930 --> 01:57:23,040
Then we got kicked out.
Not much.

2901
01:57:23,041 --> 01:57:25,350
Hi j.
J.one is called [inaudible].

2902
01:57:25,410 --> 01:57:26,660
I don't know why.
I don't know.

2903
01:57:27,910 --> 01:57:32,910
What was immigration and resist trump
movement and hashtags and the balls it

2904
01:57:33,691 --> 01:57:37,950
takes to be trump that you got literally
a million people out there protesting

2905
01:57:37,951 --> 01:57:39,090
and you make a tweet like that.

2906
01:57:40,050 --> 01:57:41,130
It's pretty funny.
Pretty funny.

2907
01:57:41,320 --> 01:57:42,780
Was fuckinG balls.
Oh yeah,

2908
01:57:42,810 --> 01:57:45,490
you gotta get you gotta.
Give him that you gotta he's gotta set

2909
01:57:45,491 --> 01:57:47,850
up whether you agree with him or not.
Just take that away,

2910
01:57:47,940 --> 01:57:50,040
take all that out and just look at what
he just did there.

2911
01:57:51,760 --> 01:57:54,660
And you gotta wonder like if churchill
had twitter,

2912
01:57:55,930 --> 01:57:57,360
you know,
would it be this?

2913
01:57:57,390 --> 01:57:59,820
Is it just that he has the tools?
Oh yeah.

2914
01:57:59,821 --> 01:58:02,160
Well this is unprecedented.
There's never been,

2915
01:58:02,190 --> 01:58:03,420
I mean,
not only that,

2916
01:58:03,470 --> 01:58:08,470
like he's got a style like sad,
like this style of saying things and

2917
01:58:08,701 --> 01:58:11,220
then writing set and then attacking
people.

2918
01:58:11,550 --> 01:58:14,160
Like who the fuck has ever been the
president?

2919
01:58:14,161 --> 01:58:17,820
And as personally attack lion ted,
crooked hillary.

2920
01:58:18,150 --> 01:58:21,180
I mean he's,
what does he call sloppy steve bannon.

2921
01:58:21,560 --> 01:58:23,760
Nobody calls them now calls him sloppy
steve.

2922
01:58:23,790 --> 01:58:26,700
PolItical people either and he just a
couple days ago you went after somebody,

2923
01:58:26,701 --> 01:58:28,230
some rapper or something.

2924
01:58:28,350 --> 01:58:31,470
Jay z,
jay z was talking about.

2925
01:58:31,471 --> 01:58:33,750
I'll say he goes,
jay z apparently doesn't understand at

2926
01:58:33,751 --> 01:58:37,890
the lowest unemployment rate for blacks
ever is going on right now because that

2927
01:58:37,891 --> 01:58:39,860
really affects you as eli.
Who knows,

2928
01:58:39,861 --> 01:58:43,480
a lot of poor black people hasn't
responded to m and m responses or jay z,

2929
01:58:43,481 --> 01:58:45,310
but not m and m's too vicious and he's
white.

2930
01:58:45,880 --> 01:58:50,350
I think that was just another moment in
my life self aware enough.

2931
01:58:50,680 --> 01:58:52,390
So prefab and we're like,
oh man,

2932
01:58:52,391 --> 01:58:54,070
he just.
You just got burned wishing to sketch

2933
01:58:54,071 --> 01:58:55,450
with owen benjamin doing the m and m
thing.

2934
01:58:55,480 --> 01:58:58,540
It was like a jewish executive writing
and stuff like it's going to kill kids.

2935
01:58:58,570 --> 01:59:00,170
Call the president a bitch.
Like,

2936
01:59:00,430 --> 01:59:02,410
yeah.
I felt like it could have been better,

2937
01:59:04,330 --> 01:59:06,310
but it pissed,
pissed him off more that you didn't

2938
01:59:06,311 --> 01:59:08,880
respond.
You're just another moment you gotta

2939
01:59:08,890 --> 01:59:10,000
like maybe you're self aware.

2940
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:11,470
Maybe it knows what's because he said he
had the next.

2941
01:59:11,471 --> 01:59:13,540
He's like lights maybe.
He was like macaulay culkin when the

2942
01:59:13,570 --> 01:59:15,160
criminals were coming to his house.
HE was like,

2943
01:59:15,280 --> 01:59:17,590
if Donald Trump responds,
I'll be ready.

2944
01:59:17,850 --> 01:59:19,150
And Donald Trump was like,
okay,

2945
01:59:19,670 --> 01:59:20,740
yeah,
that was it.

2946
01:59:20,800 --> 01:59:21,410
I don't care.
And you know,

2947
01:59:21,410 --> 01:59:23,200
eminem had already had his neck cipher
written,

2948
01:59:23,201 --> 01:59:24,034
like,
come on,

2949
01:59:26,480 --> 01:59:28,990
like the pauses and everything are fake.
It's like,

2950
01:59:29,260 --> 01:59:30,430
hold up,
wait a minute.

2951
01:59:31,540 --> 01:59:33,590
Come on.
It's like a comic who like,

2952
01:59:33,640 --> 01:59:35,050
I'm going to take suggestions from the
audience.

2953
01:59:35,290 --> 01:59:37,020
Oh,
it's mcdonald's,

2954
01:59:37,060 --> 01:59:38,290
and you're like,
you know,

2955
01:59:38,291 --> 01:59:41,920
you've done this 50 times saying that
back when you don't make the audience.

2956
01:59:42,060 --> 01:59:43,270
Have you ever watched one of those?
You're like,

2957
01:59:44,070 --> 01:59:45,970
this doesn't work.
There's a big long pause and it's a.

2958
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:49,090
But he was intentional.
He had time to post production.

2959
01:59:49,300 --> 01:59:52,060
My favorite part things.
How he's got a bunch of bar people

2960
01:59:52,061 --> 01:59:52,900
sitting around watching them.

2961
01:59:52,930 --> 01:59:54,490
Yeah,
that's my favorite part.

2962
01:59:54,710 --> 01:59:56,830
I know they're all sitting around
watching and he's,

2963
01:59:56,890 --> 02:00:00,160
he's doing all the talking and he's not
buddies with all of them.

2964
02:00:00,190 --> 02:00:02,650
He wants you to think that they came
straight out of central casting.

2965
02:00:02,980 --> 02:00:04,480
You think?
SomE of them.

2966
02:00:05,450 --> 02:00:06,160
I like,
some of them.

2967
02:00:06,160 --> 02:00:08,170
Were they paid by the same people that
pay the women to march?

2968
02:00:08,880 --> 02:00:10,740
Ciu.
Source.

2969
02:00:12,120 --> 02:00:14,520
I'm sitting through a shitty cipher.
Okay.

2970
02:00:14,710 --> 02:00:17,150
Was one of the best moments ever when,
when,

2971
02:00:17,180 --> 02:00:19,600
uh,
Alex Jones got high on the podcast and

2972
02:00:19,601 --> 02:00:21,400
then it came up during his divorce
hearing.

2973
02:00:21,890 --> 02:00:23,560
He goes,
I only smoked marijuana once a year to

2974
02:00:23,561 --> 02:00:26,140
find out if george soros is making it
stronger.

2975
02:00:26,290 --> 02:00:27,090
There's,
there's,

2976
02:00:27,090 --> 02:00:30,130
they're doing something of the weed.
I got to test it for potency.

2977
02:00:31,820 --> 02:00:34,540
Soros is imagined.
Soros sitting there and it's fucking

2978
02:00:34,541 --> 02:00:38,250
castle somewhere.
Jack up the potency and the weed.

2979
02:00:42,520 --> 02:00:47,520
He makes the kids on kitten high enough
that actually say,

2980
02:00:49,500 --> 02:00:53,110
tell them he not only said that he
couldn't remember his kids' teachers'

2981
02:00:53,111 --> 02:00:54,190
names,
so he said,

2982
02:00:54,191 --> 02:00:55,870
well,
I had a big bowl of chili today.

2983
02:00:55,871 --> 02:01:00,310
I can't remember.
Said I have a big bowl of chili.

2984
02:01:00,311 --> 02:01:02,410
I can't remember.
Has he been on the show since then?

2985
02:01:02,440 --> 02:01:03,850
No,
it's too much of a liability with the

2986
02:01:04,030 --> 02:01:05,120
cheating on.
I'd have them on.

2987
02:01:05,650 --> 02:01:07,600
I just wanted it for him.
If his lawyers won't be careful.

2988
02:01:07,780 --> 02:01:11,260
He just hasn't been in la.
He asked me to do his show in austin and

2989
02:01:11,261 --> 02:01:12,820
I'm sorry alex.
I couldn't do it.

2990
02:01:12,850 --> 02:01:16,000
I was in and out.
I was in like two hours before my shows.

2991
02:01:16,240 --> 02:01:19,390
I had two shows that night out had fly
out at 7:00 AM and the next day,

2992
02:01:19,600 --> 02:01:22,740
well he's a very hospitable guy.
He's aggressively hospitable because he

2993
02:01:22,750 --> 02:01:24,630
tried to get us.
He left me a voicemail and you're all

2994
02:01:24,631 --> 02:01:25,510
saying that and you're like,
hey,

2995
02:01:25,540 --> 02:01:26,380
here's your.
Come on,

2996
02:01:26,500 --> 02:01:27,910
come on.
Don't don't be a pussy.

2997
02:01:28,210 --> 02:01:30,700
Just
chasing us around.

2998
02:01:31,150 --> 02:01:33,070
They're like,
if you find this guy punched him and let

2999
02:01:33,071 --> 02:01:34,630
us know.
We have people snapping pictures of us.

3000
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:35,890
It's like,
so we got to go.

3001
02:01:35,891 --> 02:01:39,110
This is what we did a.
We were undercover at a south by

3002
02:01:39,111 --> 02:01:39,944
southwest

3003
02:01:39,980 --> 02:01:41,640
and and we could avoid them.
Like I just,

3004
02:01:41,750 --> 02:01:44,030
I just don't understand why you don't.
we have studios here and we can protect

3005
02:01:44,031 --> 02:01:47,090
you or it's like you don't understand we
are halfway to waco or out of town.

3006
02:01:47,091 --> 02:01:48,360
Is there a total or not be opposed to
it?

3007
02:01:48,910 --> 02:01:50,960
It was really trying to be very
hospitable,

3008
02:01:51,200 --> 02:01:52,910
but we were just trying to get out oF
town.

3009
02:01:53,090 --> 02:01:56,120
I got more hate from that episode too,
but also I was like,

3010
02:01:56,121 --> 02:01:57,710
look,
don't you see why I love him?

3011
02:01:58,130 --> 02:02:01,160
Like you see him when he's drunk and
stoned and we're having a great time.

3012
02:02:01,161 --> 02:02:04,950
It's talking about interdimensional
child molesters and when he was chris,

3013
02:02:04,951 --> 02:02:06,530
great television,
he's crazy.

3014
02:02:06,531 --> 02:02:09,200
That's great.
Tell like Alex Jones is a fun guy.

3015
02:02:09,380 --> 02:02:10,280
You know,
and look,

3016
02:02:10,340 --> 02:02:12,380
I'm not,
I don't believe everything he believes.

3017
02:02:12,381 --> 02:02:14,330
I don't mean he believes sandy hook was
fake,

3018
02:02:14,720 --> 02:02:16,550
you know,
it's a rough one.

3019
02:02:16,730 --> 02:02:20,390
I think he's dropped that since then and
he tries to come up with some caveats or

3020
02:02:20,391 --> 02:02:21,760
something like that or some,
some,

3021
02:02:21,820 --> 02:02:25,590
some things when we're not shown that
were real or new evidence has come to.

3022
02:02:26,430 --> 02:02:28,910
Yeah,
I don't know what the fuck that was all

3023
02:02:28,911 --> 02:02:30,980
about that.
I've heard that one from a few careless

3024
02:02:30,981 --> 02:02:31,581
people.
I'm like,

3025
02:02:31,581 --> 02:02:32,810
man,
you can't say that,

3026
02:02:32,880 --> 02:02:35,180
but then there was.
The vegas thing was a conspiracy.

3027
02:02:35,750 --> 02:02:38,390
A lot of people take that one.
That's a weird one,

3028
02:02:38,510 --> 02:02:40,460
but nothing's come up since then.
That was weird.

3029
02:02:40,520 --> 02:02:42,230
The way.
Here's the vegas one.

3030
02:02:42,260 --> 02:02:46,280
Here's what's weird about the vegas one.
It seems like there's differing opinions

3031
02:02:46,281 --> 02:02:48,620
on timelines.
There's different stories rather on

3032
02:02:48,621 --> 02:02:51,770
timelines.
There's possibility that someone may

3033
02:02:51,771 --> 02:02:54,420
have aided him.
He and he,

3034
02:02:54,440 --> 02:02:58,190
the guy was a fucking evil cunt.
He covered his tracks.

3035
02:02:58,400 --> 02:03:00,320
I mean it's almost like he wanted people
to go crazy.

3036
02:03:00,320 --> 02:03:01,850
Search warrant,
document shows.

3037
02:03:01,851 --> 02:03:03,740
Second person of interest after las
vegas.

3038
02:03:03,800 --> 02:03:06,890
She,
this class a couple of hours really

3039
02:03:06,891 --> 02:03:10,160
unsealed documents in a guy's name,
douglas haig or something popped up and.

3040
02:03:10,161 --> 02:03:11,060
Okay,
well there you go.

3041
02:03:11,090 --> 02:03:12,710
That's interest.
So that makes sense.

3042
02:03:12,711 --> 02:03:13,544
The biggest review,
I mean,

3043
02:03:13,550 --> 02:03:15,200
who else is reporting this?
It makes me everywhere.

3044
02:03:15,201 --> 02:03:16,310
Everywhere is everywhere.
Okay.

3045
02:03:16,311 --> 02:03:17,180
Yeah.
So I,

3046
02:03:17,720 --> 02:03:21,020
I would imagine that what's going on is
there's probably so many that helped him

3047
02:03:21,021 --> 02:03:24,490
get the guns and help to move them up
into the room or something along that.

3048
02:03:24,500 --> 02:03:25,600
There's a lot of sense.
Yeah.

3049
02:03:25,670 --> 02:03:26,780
No,
I mean there are people saying like the

3050
02:03:26,781 --> 02:03:29,180
bodies were fake and I kind of stepped
out of their mind.

3051
02:03:29,181 --> 02:03:31,080
I know somebody who got shot there.
Yeah,

3052
02:03:31,310 --> 02:03:34,010
I know somebody who got shot there and
one of the girls who was the ring card

3053
02:03:34,011 --> 02:03:38,210
girl was there while it happened and she
escaped narrowly with her life while

3054
02:03:38,211 --> 02:03:41,080
people were dropping right in front of
her as she was running rooms.

3055
02:03:41,120 --> 02:03:42,890
Ashley,
as she was running,

3056
02:03:43,160 --> 02:03:44,840
people were getting shot right in front
of her.

3057
02:03:45,050 --> 02:03:46,940
Dan bilzerian was there.
Dan told me,

3058
02:03:47,350 --> 02:03:48,920
lady's head get blown off.
That's right.

3059
02:03:48,921 --> 02:03:51,800
He does hit a lady's head,
exploded right in front of them.

3060
02:03:53,090 --> 02:03:54,380
Yeah.
That's where.

3061
02:03:54,381 --> 02:03:55,880
That's where.
Let's say there's a conspiracy,

3062
02:03:55,940 --> 02:03:56,351
right?
Let's say,

3063
02:03:56,351 --> 02:03:56,760
okay,
there's.

3064
02:03:56,760 --> 02:03:58,310
Let's say this is the second person.
Help them.

3065
02:03:58,340 --> 02:04:00,440
Let's even say there's a second shooter.
Could have been.

3066
02:04:00,680 --> 02:04:02,840
Could have been.
It doesn't undo the horror.

3067
02:04:02,900 --> 02:04:05,510
That doesn't mean there was some
conspiracy necessarily to cover up a

3068
02:04:05,511 --> 02:04:06,860
second shooter.
Maybe there's new information that's

3069
02:04:06,861 --> 02:04:09,980
come to light and there's often a grain
of truth sometimes and then people go

3070
02:04:10,280 --> 02:04:15,280
there for better da da da da da da,
and it just was trying to tell me what

3071
02:04:15,471 --> 02:04:17,960
they reported.
Shooters that all these other casinos,

3072
02:04:17,961 --> 02:04:19,060
but then the news never covered.
I go,

3073
02:04:19,100 --> 02:04:20,030
no,
you don't understand.

3074
02:04:20,510 --> 02:04:24,680
When there's 50 people to get murdered
by a guy who's shooting out of a fucking

3075
02:04:24,681 --> 02:04:27,320
mandalay bay window,
you're going to have chaos and when you

3076
02:04:27,321 --> 02:04:29,060
have chaos,
people run into casinos.

3077
02:04:29,090 --> 02:04:30,440
There's a shooter,
there's a shooter,

3078
02:04:30,590 --> 02:04:33,230
they'll run into circus circus.
They're running into mgm.

3079
02:04:33,380 --> 02:04:34,640
They'll scream.
There's a shooter.

3080
02:04:34,730 --> 02:04:36,260
People get on the phone,
they call,

3081
02:04:36,350 --> 02:04:39,210
they call security.
A shooter at the mgm doesn't mean as a

3082
02:04:39,510 --> 02:04:41,640
shooter at the mgm,
it means there's chaos.

3083
02:04:41,700 --> 02:04:43,950
Right.
And you get a lot of bad information,

3084
02:04:43,990 --> 02:04:45,420
puts it a lot of echo,
I'm sure too.

3085
02:04:45,421 --> 02:04:47,340
So in the middle of chaos,
you don't know where it's coming from.

3086
02:04:47,850 --> 02:04:52,850
The mandalay bay,
one of the girls that was at the ufc,

3087
02:04:52,861 --> 02:04:55,920
she got her leg blown out because
someone had got shot and killed right in

3088
02:04:55,921 --> 02:04:58,920
front of her and the guy fell on her leg
and it blew her acl out.

3089
02:04:59,720 --> 02:05:01,320
Yeah.
One of the fighters from the ufc.

3090
02:05:01,330 --> 02:05:01,831
No,
no,

3091
02:05:01,831 --> 02:05:03,090
no.
One of the girls who was at the,

3092
02:05:03,091 --> 02:05:05,340
uh,
at the event and then dana white got a

3093
02:05:05,341 --> 02:05:08,670
bunch of people that got shot and
everything and dana white's the best and

3094
02:05:08,671 --> 02:05:11,190
he brought these people to the event and
you know,

3095
02:05:11,200 --> 02:05:13,920
it's like we did an event that week,
man.

3096
02:05:14,190 --> 02:05:19,190
I did a comedy show that week.
I did a comedy show at the mirage that

3097
02:05:19,531 --> 02:05:21,720
fried.
I donated all the money to the vegas

3098
02:05:21,721 --> 02:05:23,530
victims fund,
but it was just like,

3099
02:05:23,730 --> 02:05:26,040
it was weird.
The whole thing was weird.

3100
02:05:26,130 --> 02:05:26,731
Yeah.
That is.

3101
02:05:26,731 --> 02:05:29,370
Um,
and it is weird to sing country music

3102
02:05:29,371 --> 02:05:30,630
festival.
Yeah,

3103
02:05:30,660 --> 02:05:32,250
exactly.
There was a right wing people.

3104
02:05:32,280 --> 02:05:33,720
I mean,
so I'm not saying this as a left wing

3105
02:05:33,721 --> 02:05:35,340
extremists,
but it is weird that we didn't really

3106
02:05:35,341 --> 02:05:37,890
hear a whole lot after that.
This guy didn't give a fuck who he was

3107
02:05:37,891 --> 02:05:38,340
killing.

3108
02:05:38,340 --> 02:05:40,530
He wasn't trying to kill country music
people.

3109
02:05:40,531 --> 02:05:44,930
He dId this at other music events to
where he showed up and scanned it in and

3110
02:05:44,970 --> 02:05:48,990
got hotel rooms and overlooked the exact
same sort of a scenario.

3111
02:05:49,080 --> 02:05:51,930
He was plotting this.
He just wanted to kill a bunch of people

3112
02:05:51,931 --> 02:05:52,890
and then kill himself.
He said,

3113
02:05:53,490 --> 02:05:55,980
and by the way,
here's another guy that was on some sort

3114
02:05:55,981 --> 02:05:59,610
of psych medication and this is a
constant and these mass shooters and

3115
02:05:59,611 --> 02:06:03,510
this is one of the things that gets
ignored and it should be fucking front

3116
02:06:03,511 --> 02:06:05,730
and center and everybody's mind.
They should be thinking,

3117
02:06:05,731 --> 02:06:08,280
what are we doing to people by giving
them these pills?

3118
02:06:08,550 --> 02:06:11,040
What the fuck are we doing on xanax or
something?

3119
02:06:11,041 --> 02:06:13,420
He wAs on anti anxiety medication,
which,

3120
02:06:13,480 --> 02:06:14,960
which has,
by the way,

3121
02:06:15,030 --> 02:06:17,610
same kind of shit that chris cornell was
on when he hung himself.

3122
02:06:17,910 --> 02:06:20,220
That antianxiety medication is no joke.
And,

3123
02:06:20,221 --> 02:06:23,680
and who knows what kind of a weird
adverse reaction you're going to have to

3124
02:06:23,681 --> 02:06:24,730
that stuff.
Yeah.

3125
02:06:25,040 --> 02:06:27,390
People react.
They do the genetic testing now and I've

3126
02:06:27,391 --> 02:06:29,100
done that for,
I don't know if you've done that now

3127
02:06:29,101 --> 02:06:31,590
they do it as a consumer thing.
Twenty three and me I think,

3128
02:06:32,040 --> 02:06:34,740
but actually my doctor actually did
genetic testing where we did it in the

3129
02:06:34,741 --> 02:06:35,670
office to check,
you know,

3130
02:06:35,671 --> 02:06:38,790
for predispositions towards diseases and
also you can check to see which

3131
02:06:38,791 --> 02:06:41,040
medications you might have negative
interactions with.

3132
02:06:41,440 --> 02:06:43,110
Um,
and they found out for me there were

3133
02:06:43,111 --> 02:06:46,350
certain painkillers that would be really
bad that I wouldn't process super

3134
02:06:46,351 --> 02:06:47,820
effectively.
And then some that would work.

3135
02:06:48,060 --> 02:06:50,070
Um,
same thing as far as even like,

3136
02:06:50,310 --> 02:06:54,900
I think it was a celebrex would've been
worse for me to take advil.

3137
02:06:55,020 --> 02:06:56,820
So things like that,
like this actually works better with

3138
02:06:56,821 --> 02:06:59,790
your body chemistry and when you get the
psychotropic medication.

3139
02:07:00,390 --> 02:07:03,360
I mean think about it.
like I had negative interactions with a

3140
02:07:03,361 --> 02:07:05,490
list of whatever antidepressants run.
They're like,

3141
02:07:05,491 --> 02:07:06,810
do Not take.
There was a green,

3142
02:07:07,050 --> 02:07:08,580
green column,
yellow column,

3143
02:07:08,581 --> 02:07:10,950
red column,
and most people don't know and it's not

3144
02:07:10,951 --> 02:07:13,650
entirely accurate,
but they're saying that it's increasing

3145
02:07:13,890 --> 02:07:17,490
the efficacy of,
of medication by like 50 percent using

3146
02:07:17,491 --> 02:07:19,600
this as a guideline.
That is fascinating.

3147
02:07:20,610 --> 02:07:21,960
And you know,
and by the way,

3148
02:07:21,961 --> 02:07:23,940
that guy,
his whole family is fucking crazy.

3149
02:07:24,150 --> 02:07:26,850
That guy,
his dad was a serial bank robber.

3150
02:07:27,030 --> 02:07:30,240
The guy's brother got busted for child
pornography.

3151
02:07:30,241 --> 02:07:31,860
that's what whitney cummings brought up
the other day.

3152
02:07:31,861 --> 02:07:33,720
She thought it was the shooter is
actually his brother.

3153
02:07:33,840 --> 02:07:36,010
I remember it after the fact on some,
on his computer

3154
02:07:36,010 --> 02:07:37,420
to apparently.
Damn.

3155
02:07:37,750 --> 02:07:41,020
The whole family is fucking kids.
Don't the shooter?

3156
02:07:41,840 --> 02:07:44,260
Yeah.
Laptops that was in the room or that one

3157
02:07:44,261 --> 02:07:46,990
of the five laptops had apparently so
maybe borrowed it from his brother.

3158
02:07:47,890 --> 02:07:49,530
That's his excuse.
Guaranteed.

3159
02:07:49,570 --> 02:07:51,040
That's what he told the cop before he
shot himself.

3160
02:07:51,700 --> 02:07:54,610
Well,
apparently someone fired a gun in the

3161
02:07:54,611 --> 02:07:57,260
room besides him to.
Who fucked knows.

3162
02:07:57,280 --> 02:07:58,780
That was one thing.
The room service bill.

3163
02:07:58,870 --> 02:08:01,540
That was something that there was a lot,
there were a lot of conspiracies and

3164
02:08:01,541 --> 02:08:03,970
that's like an example where I think
people said no one had been to the room

3165
02:08:03,971 --> 02:08:05,610
for a long time and then there was a
room service bill.

3166
02:08:05,611 --> 02:08:08,590
It said someone had been in the room
room service and then it looked like,

3167
02:08:08,591 --> 02:08:11,500
I think by the aMount of food that they
were possibly two people in the room,

3168
02:08:12,010 --> 02:08:14,500
like I've known fat people who go to the
drive through number two,

3169
02:08:14,520 --> 02:08:16,420
diet cokes,
come me feel less guilty.

3170
02:08:16,450 --> 02:08:19,400
Check to see how much I eat food.
I go,

3171
02:08:19,520 --> 02:08:22,750
I'll go To the gym and then I'll order
room service and people like how many

3172
02:08:22,751 --> 02:08:23,380
people?
Mike?

3173
02:08:23,380 --> 02:08:23,990
One.
They'll go,

3174
02:08:23,990 --> 02:08:24,880
you sure?
I'm like,

3175
02:08:25,270 --> 02:08:26,170
bring it up,
bitch.

3176
02:08:26,830 --> 02:08:28,960
I order two entrees all the time.
Yeah.

3177
02:08:29,410 --> 02:08:30,201
Well,
because usually yeah,

3178
02:08:30,201 --> 02:08:32,510
especially to forgetting what you went
two times to meet or you want to.

3179
02:08:33,090 --> 02:08:34,540
If I'm work,
if I'm lifting,

3180
02:08:34,570 --> 02:08:36,750
I fucking get hungry man.
crazy.

3181
02:08:36,780 --> 02:08:39,040
Rippetoe ordering double meat.
That one time we went out with him.

3182
02:08:39,070 --> 02:08:40,720
Oh my gosh,
he's just an animal,

3183
02:08:40,990 --> 02:08:43,320
but I'm double means double.
No,

3184
02:08:44,070 --> 02:08:46,270
double The meat.
We don't do that,

3185
02:08:46,271 --> 02:08:49,840
like figure it out as a strength trainer
and he's also a scientist and he,

3186
02:08:49,841 --> 02:08:51,630
uh,
he grow starting strengths and he just

3187
02:08:51,670 --> 02:08:52,331
was,
we were,

3188
02:08:52,331 --> 02:08:53,890
we were somewhere and he just asked the
server.

3189
02:08:54,850 --> 02:08:57,520
He goes,
please double meat.

3190
02:08:57,910 --> 02:08:58,591
She goes,
well,

3191
02:08:58,591 --> 02:08:59,470
uh,
so you want,

3192
02:08:59,471 --> 02:09:02,170
you want a dollar more?
And he went to ladders mores figure it

3193
02:09:02,171 --> 02:09:03,004
out.

3194
02:09:05,630 --> 02:09:09,020
That's not a good thing to say to
someone who's handling your food this

3195
02:09:09,070 --> 02:09:10,710
out bitch.
But the room service bill,

3196
02:09:10,711 --> 02:09:11,950
that was something where I read it and I
was like,

3197
02:09:11,980 --> 02:09:12,790
oh,
that's curious,

3198
02:09:12,790 --> 02:09:13,750
right?
The room service bell.

3199
02:09:13,840 --> 02:09:16,060
That's my point is with the kernel of
truth in some of these conspiracies,

3200
02:09:16,061 --> 02:09:17,320
but people,
they go on a second,

3201
02:09:17,321 --> 02:09:21,010
the room service bill has to tuna fish
sandwiches and one steak tartare.

3202
02:09:21,070 --> 02:09:22,660
Therefore the jews,
you know,

3203
02:09:22,700 --> 02:09:22,991
it's like,
well,

3204
02:09:22,991 --> 02:09:26,500
hold on a second,
you're making a huge leap and it makes

3205
02:09:26,501 --> 02:09:27,170
it hard.
Like there's,

3206
02:09:27,170 --> 02:09:30,100
there's a plus side to new media,
which we talk about this all the time.

3207
02:09:30,101 --> 02:09:33,010
We feel a lot of responsibility,
especially being more of a entertainment

3208
02:09:33,011 --> 02:09:37,030
show where it's great because you can do
the show and you don't have the same

3209
02:09:37,031 --> 02:09:40,000
kind of time constraints and you can
talk about things authentically as long

3210
02:09:40,001 --> 02:09:42,070
as you know for the youtube stuff they
allow us to.

3211
02:09:42,460 --> 02:09:45,040
BuT on the flip side is anyone can get
information out there and there are

3212
02:09:45,041 --> 02:09:47,260
people willing to capitalize on that and
proactively lie.

3213
02:09:47,290 --> 02:09:49,270
Right?
And so like I get it,

3214
02:09:49,330 --> 02:09:51,640
that's a problem,
but the solution is not to have a bunch

3215
02:09:51,641 --> 02:09:54,190
of people in silicon valley determining
what's right,

3216
02:09:54,220 --> 02:09:55,360
what's right.
Well,

3217
02:09:55,361 --> 02:09:57,520
I mean it's just like those flat earth
fucks.

3218
02:09:57,550 --> 02:10:00,520
You can make a video on anything.
I mean if you want to make a video and

3219
02:10:00,521 --> 02:10:02,620
if it's compelling,
the same flat earth guy,

3220
02:10:02,621 --> 02:10:06,790
he's got a video on dinosaurs not being
real nuclear bombs being fake satellites

3221
02:10:06,791 --> 02:10:11,791
being fake really jitsu doesn't work.
Wing chung is the shit fucking mind this

3222
02:10:12,131 --> 02:10:14,590
guy and people are.
People ignore that.

3223
02:10:14,650 --> 02:10:16,700
They ignore that and just like,
hey,

3224
02:10:16,701 --> 02:10:17,740
yeah,
but it's flutter.

3225
02:10:17,741 --> 02:10:19,420
Think pretty compelling man.
GoTta look into it.

3226
02:10:20,030 --> 02:10:20,920
Know,
but to quito,

3227
02:10:20,921 --> 02:10:21,754
I wouldn't be there.

3228
02:10:21,910 --> 02:10:22,830
yeah,
I wouldn't.

3229
02:10:23,560 --> 02:10:25,120
I would not be there.
I'd sidestep you.

3230
02:10:25,390 --> 02:10:26,590
Oh my god.
Yeah.

3231
02:10:26,591 --> 02:10:27,880
that's what it.
That's one of my favorite things to do

3232
02:10:27,881 --> 02:10:31,180
is watch those on youtube.
I post those on instagram left and

3233
02:10:31,181 --> 02:10:31,901
right.
Yeah.

3234
02:10:31,901 --> 02:10:34,640
The hashtag.
If you just look up hashtag legit as

3235
02:10:34,641 --> 02:10:36,710
fuck.
That's my hashtag.

3236
02:10:36,770 --> 02:10:40,940
I put put up with all fake martial arts
videos of like,

3237
02:10:40,941 --> 02:10:44,540
I don't know how many of them I posted
whatever illuminati frame somewhere in

3238
02:10:44,541 --> 02:10:48,260
there that I'm not gonna.
Stop posting a man because now when you

3239
02:10:48,500 --> 02:10:51,140
repost them,
I'm my fucking instagram is getting

3240
02:10:51,141 --> 02:10:54,380
flagged with people are claiming them
with martial arts videos.

3241
02:10:54,410 --> 02:10:57,600
Even if they didn't make them,
they can claim them and say it's theirs

3242
02:10:57,620 --> 02:11:00,500
and they can get it taken down from
facebook or instagram.

3243
02:11:00,520 --> 02:11:03,500
Shake you down for a few books,
but they didn't necessarily film them,

3244
02:11:03,501 --> 02:11:05,930
but if they say it's there,
it's you have to prove it's not.

3245
02:11:05,940 --> 02:11:09,110
There's like there's a lot of squirrelly
people out there when it comes to videos

3246
02:11:09,111 --> 02:11:11,320
online,
especially people who were flooded with

3247
02:11:11,321 --> 02:11:13,230
clayton claimers.
One.

3248
02:11:13,480 --> 02:11:16,190
One person tried to argue that with me
and you know the whole mandela effect.

3249
02:11:16,191 --> 02:11:17,024
That's another thing.
Yeah.

3250
02:11:17,110 --> 02:11:17,811
Into.
He's like,

3251
02:11:17,811 --> 02:11:19,940
it's parents,
it's berenstein bears,

3252
02:11:19,941 --> 02:11:21,610
not berenstein bears.
Like you thought it was going to

3253
02:11:21,611 --> 02:11:24,830
convince me I'm going last because it
was because I am not shizam that genie

3254
02:11:24,831 --> 02:11:26,530
movie with shack.
Like that's a big thing for that.

3255
02:11:26,720 --> 02:11:29,810
This is the hill they die on with the
same person was a flat earth or and said

3256
02:11:29,811 --> 02:11:30,644
something like,
uh,

3257
02:11:30,840 --> 02:11:31,940
okay.
It's an easy test.

3258
02:11:32,130 --> 02:11:33,350
The earth is spinning,
right?

3259
02:11:33,351 --> 02:11:34,550
If it's spinning a thousand miles an
hour,

3260
02:11:34,551 --> 02:11:36,350
okay,
you go up in a helicopter,

3261
02:11:36,440 --> 02:11:37,610
don't move,
go back down.

3262
02:11:37,790 --> 02:11:39,800
If you're in the same place,
it's a lie,

3263
02:11:39,801 --> 02:11:40,401
you know it.
And I said,

3264
02:11:40,401 --> 02:11:42,350
hold on a second,
like I'm not a scientist,

3265
02:11:42,351 --> 02:11:44,780
but I know if I throw a baseball from
the back of the bus,

3266
02:11:44,810 --> 02:11:47,600
it's going to the front of the bus
because we're starting at the same

3267
02:11:47,601 --> 02:11:48,120
velocity.

3268
02:11:48,120 --> 02:11:50,570
I mean this is basic physics that you
will learn in high school.

3269
02:11:50,840 --> 02:11:51,651
So that's where,
for me,

3270
02:11:51,651 --> 02:11:54,080
I was like my mount saint helens volcano
this way.

3271
02:11:54,650 --> 02:11:58,460
That's what they say to do this.
They just don't understand science.

3272
02:11:58,461 --> 02:12:00,230
They don't understand physics and
they're just.

3273
02:12:00,380 --> 02:12:02,270
They.
They say things and it's compelling to

3274
02:12:02,271 --> 02:12:04,970
people.
There's photos of the fucking glaciers

3275
02:12:05,180 --> 02:12:06,470
in antarctica and they like,
look,

3276
02:12:06,471 --> 02:12:08,960
it's the oldest wall,
like they really believe there's an ice

3277
02:12:08,961 --> 02:12:12,100
wall.
It was pretty bad ass will be saved.

3278
02:12:12,101 --> 02:12:14,660
Donald trump's some money,
but managing anybody keeping that

3279
02:12:14,690 --> 02:12:17,050
secret.
Imagine someone like some high.

3280
02:12:17,550 --> 02:12:18,830
Well,
jamie's got round earth.

3281
02:12:18,831 --> 02:12:20,990
She'll tee shirts for sale.
Young jamie.com.

3282
02:12:21,210 --> 02:12:22,100
Hold on right now.
Oh,

3283
02:12:22,101 --> 02:12:24,800
do your pitch with.
That's the question to why,

3284
02:12:25,470 --> 02:12:28,040
right?
Like we're not scientists and there's a

3285
02:12:28,041 --> 02:12:30,200
bunch that you could probably.
Someone could come on and talk about the

3286
02:12:30,201 --> 02:12:32,090
earth's core and talk about the
gravitational pull that we'd be like,

3287
02:12:32,120 --> 02:12:32,360
oh wow.

3288
02:12:32,360 --> 02:12:33,710
That's really.
I didn't know that.

3289
02:12:33,770 --> 02:12:36,230
I feel like an idiot,
but I can all.

3290
02:12:36,260 --> 02:12:38,960
I can't ask.
Why would anyone want to convince me?

3291
02:12:38,961 --> 02:12:40,890
There's a flat earth.
Yeah.

3292
02:12:40,970 --> 02:12:43,190
What is your.
Why would anyone want to convince you

3293
02:12:43,191 --> 02:12:44,400
that it's round?
It's actually flat.

3294
02:12:44,430 --> 02:12:46,970
I don't understand the ground earth.
This property.

3295
02:12:46,971 --> 02:12:49,220
Too much.
People just love bullshit.

3296
02:12:49,250 --> 02:12:50,930
They get off on it,
there's no audience for it,

3297
02:12:51,950 --> 02:12:55,310
but they enjoy it.
I think they really enjoy bullshit.

3298
02:12:55,490 --> 02:13:00,490
Like I think people get excited about
things that they can try to uncover some

3299
02:13:00,561 --> 02:13:02,060
human thing like,
uh,

3300
02:13:02,090 --> 02:13:04,010
like,
like I think they're going to attack us,

3301
02:13:04,011 --> 02:13:06,110
you know,
like there's like a secret,

3302
02:13:06,140 --> 02:13:07,880
sort of like a,
not a secret,

3303
02:13:07,881 --> 02:13:10,600
but like a thing in your head about
uncovering secrets.

3304
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:12,170
You know what that Is,
I think.

3305
02:13:12,230 --> 02:13:14,970
I think it appeals to the contrarians
too because they just liked to piss

3306
02:13:14,971 --> 02:13:15,380
people off.

3307
02:13:15,380 --> 02:13:18,590
They liked to do and a lot of them were
just really uneducated.

3308
02:13:18,860 --> 02:13:22,340
I mean super uneducated,
like they just don't understand basic

3309
02:13:22,370 --> 02:13:24,560
physics,
like just a few things.

3310
02:13:24,740 --> 02:13:26,450
The martial arts thing is a good example
with that,

3311
02:13:26,451 --> 02:13:30,380
because not get joe to starting to do,
Starting to do jujitsu and a weight

3312
02:13:30,400 --> 02:13:33,930
training in this world where we're from.
actually the guy who does my security.

3313
02:13:33,931 --> 02:13:34,764
That's true.
Black belt.

3314
02:13:34,770 --> 02:13:36,180
Okay.
And so he's just startIng to,

3315
02:13:36,181 --> 02:13:38,610
we're going have him come into this
studio to kinda some privates with them.

3316
02:13:39,070 --> 02:13:40,820
Um,
this guy's talking you.

3317
02:13:40,920 --> 02:13:43,050
He's a crazy,
insanely sanely strong dude.

3318
02:13:43,051 --> 02:13:44,100
It's one of the guys that you look at
and go,

3319
02:13:44,160 --> 02:13:45,360
oh,
it doesn't matter if I trained my whole

3320
02:13:45,361 --> 02:13:46,440
life,
I wouldn't be that strong.

3321
02:13:46,610 --> 02:13:48,570
You know,
he walked in in high school to a gym

3322
02:13:48,571 --> 02:13:50,820
marker,
but doesn't get some of them buck angel.

3323
02:13:50,830 --> 02:13:51,121
No,
no,

3324
02:13:51,121 --> 02:13:51,410
no,
no.

3325
02:13:51,410 --> 02:13:54,420
This guy walked in at 1616 and I found
this [inaudible].

3326
02:13:54,421 --> 02:13:56,670
It was corroborated by mark rippetoe in
wichita falls,

3327
02:13:56,671 --> 02:13:58,800
Texas when he found out this guy's name
mark.

3328
02:13:59,000 --> 02:13:59,551
Well,
he just said,

3329
02:13:59,551 --> 02:14:00,151
he said,
wait,

3330
02:14:00,151 --> 02:14:01,950
are you talking about so and so was a
friend of mine,

3331
02:14:02,070 --> 02:14:04,200
totally accidental.
And he goes,

3332
02:14:04,350 --> 02:14:09,350
that man came into my gym at 16 years
old and accidentally snatched 270

3333
02:14:10,021 --> 02:14:12,230
pounds.
So this guy is anyways,

3334
02:14:12,240 --> 02:14:13,870
but you're super nice guy.
Super nice guy.

3335
02:14:13,871 --> 02:14:16,470
like we church going christian.
We always kind of joke about him and

3336
02:14:16,471 --> 02:14:17,280
he's like,
you know,

3337
02:14:17,280 --> 02:14:18,870
I know.
I like,

3338
02:14:18,871 --> 02:14:20,010
you know,
you can see there's something burning

3339
02:14:20,011 --> 02:14:20,761
beneath the surface.
He's like,

3340
02:14:20,761 --> 02:14:21,780
you know,
I know it's not.

3341
02:14:22,130 --> 02:14:24,960
I know it's not good,
but I wanted to kill him.

3342
02:14:25,230 --> 02:14:27,060
I was like,
at one point he was doing security.

3343
02:14:27,650 --> 02:14:29,250
He was like,
I could see him walking up to.

3344
02:14:29,300 --> 02:14:30,540
I'm like,
hold on,

3345
02:14:30,541 --> 02:14:32,600
sTop.
You can see just that little bit with

3346
02:14:32,770 --> 02:14:36,330
the shortest fuse,
but it's always amazing to me that that

3347
02:14:36,331 --> 02:14:37,710
people just deny it and it's like,
well,

3348
02:14:37,711 --> 02:14:39,840
hold on a second,
show me what you tell him about the flat

3349
02:14:39,841 --> 02:14:41,030
earth thing.
Akita,

3350
02:14:41,070 --> 02:14:45,240
show me one video ever in the history of
mankind.

3351
02:14:45,740 --> 02:14:49,100
Have a kito winning a fight against a
mixed martial arts guy.

3352
02:14:49,170 --> 02:14:51,480
Or I had someone who believed that
steven seagal was a legitimate fighter.

3353
02:14:51,481 --> 02:14:52,314
I said,
okay,

3354
02:14:52,410 --> 02:14:56,700
that's a claim,
one video ever in the history of steven

3355
02:14:56,701 --> 02:15:01,160
seagal fighting and I'm willing to never
got more crap than our bruce or Bruce

3356
02:15:01,160 --> 02:15:03,520
Lee video.
No,

3357
02:15:03,540 --> 02:15:05,280
we didn't.
I said he was a good theorist and he was

3358
02:15:05,281 --> 02:15:07,140
one of the early sort of mixed martial
arts adopters,

3359
02:15:07,141 --> 02:15:12,141
but the fact is Bruce Lee would get
killed by a decent flight in use and

3360
02:15:12,570 --> 02:15:13,740
people are like,
how dare you?

3361
02:15:13,830 --> 02:15:14,663
Well,

3362
02:15:14,770 --> 02:15:18,400
that's true.
And also The reality is the martial arts

3363
02:15:18,401 --> 02:15:22,210
from 1970 versus the martial arts from
2018,

3364
02:15:22,390 --> 02:15:25,090
there's been more radical change in
martial arts.

3365
02:15:25,091 --> 02:15:25,690
I,
uh,

3366
02:15:25,690 --> 02:15:30,690
the understanding of techniques since
1993 to 2018 than there's ever been.

3367
02:15:30,761 --> 02:15:34,000
And The history of martial arts and
Bruce Lee was responsible for a big

3368
02:15:34,001 --> 02:15:37,300
shift from 1970 to the ufc.
You,

3369
02:15:37,301 --> 02:15:39,700
it's very hard to find a single ufc
fighter.

3370
02:15:39,850 --> 02:15:42,580
There wasn't a Bruce Lee fan or isn't
currently a Bruce Lee fan,

3371
02:15:42,900 --> 02:15:45,520
including me.
and I think that what he did was

3372
02:15:45,521 --> 02:15:48,090
introduced this open minded approach to
martial arts.

3373
02:15:48,091 --> 02:15:50,260
Right?
Taking what's useful from boxing,

3374
02:15:50,261 --> 02:15:51,550
from wrestling.
I mean,

3375
02:15:51,551 --> 02:15:52,680
look,
you enter the dragon,

3376
02:15:52,690 --> 02:15:55,840
he's doing an arm bar.
Know he killed somebody killed chuck

3377
02:15:55,841 --> 02:15:56,674
norris with.
Again,

3378
02:15:56,990 --> 02:15:59,200
it wasn't the best,
but I understand what you're saying,

3379
02:15:59,340 --> 02:16:01,310
but he's doing weird stuff.
He's doing.

3380
02:16:01,311 --> 02:16:03,190
He's eight.
He obviously wasn't a black belt in

3381
02:16:03,191 --> 02:16:05,050
jujitsu.
You know,

3382
02:16:05,280 --> 02:16:06,300
what's the,
what we talked about,

3383
02:16:06,301 --> 02:16:08,950
what people got really mad at is they
were saying he would cream anybody like

3384
02:16:08,951 --> 02:16:10,410
in your class.
And so I said,

3385
02:16:10,411 --> 02:16:13,230
well hold on.
He's two inches shorter and 25 pounds

3386
02:16:13,231 --> 02:16:14,170
lighter than knock.
Hey jared,

3387
02:16:14,280 --> 02:16:17,710
and so we had not get jared and the
Bruce Lee punch is coming and people

3388
02:16:17,711 --> 02:16:20,860
were furious.
He's 25 pounds heavier and two inches

3389
02:16:20,861 --> 02:16:23,850
taller.
That's an idea as to how small of a man

3390
02:16:23,851 --> 02:16:25,620
this is.
It's just not dealing with.

3391
02:16:25,740 --> 02:16:27,570
It doesn't mean that he didn't write a
good towel,

3392
02:16:27,600 --> 02:16:29,550
didn't write a good book.
The book's great,

3393
02:16:29,551 --> 02:16:29,990
but it's also

3394
02:16:29,990 --> 02:16:34,000
a plagiarized.
He told really passages in full without

3395
02:16:34,001 --> 02:16:37,240
any accreditation at all and took,
and I don't want to say it in a bad way

3396
02:16:37,241 --> 02:16:39,970
because I think what he was trying to do
was just like his whole style.

3397
02:16:40,270 --> 02:16:44,380
He just took big chunks of books on
boxing and other different martial arts

3398
02:16:44,560 --> 02:16:49,360
and took verbatim passages from that.
Maybe plagiarizing is not the right word

3399
02:16:49,361 --> 02:16:54,361
because what is what he did was like a
collection of martial arts technique and

3400
02:16:54,701 --> 02:16:59,480
so one of the things he did see if you
could have to follow me and he was.

3401
02:17:00,070 --> 02:17:02,050
He wasn't an author.
You know what he was.

3402
02:17:02,180 --> 02:17:07,180
He was a martial artist and he was
collecting different writings on

3403
02:17:07,720 --> 02:17:10,990
different styles.
See a Bruce Lee,

3404
02:17:11,020 --> 02:17:14,430
gee,
the tao tao of jeet kune doe.

3405
02:17:14,610 --> 02:17:18,700
I'm plagiarized passages and again,
I'm a giant Bruce Lee fan.

3406
02:17:18,701 --> 02:17:20,380
I'm not shitting on him but,
but um,

3407
02:17:20,600 --> 02:17:22,060
I think it's also very important.

3408
02:17:22,060 --> 02:17:25,420
I owned the tao of jeet kune do.
I think it's very important that he did

3409
02:17:25,630 --> 02:17:28,600
collect these important works on
different martial arts and he was the

3410
02:17:28,601 --> 02:17:31,090
first dude when I first started out
doing martial arts.

3411
02:17:31,091 --> 02:17:33,490
when I was doing taekwondo.
You had to just do taekwondo.

3412
02:17:33,491 --> 02:17:37,030
When I branched out and started doing
muay thai and kickboxing,

3413
02:17:37,270 --> 02:17:40,200
they were very against it.
A lot of the traditionalist was very

3414
02:17:40,210 --> 02:17:42,190
against it,
very against trying out other

3415
02:17:42,191 --> 02:17:44,050
techniques.
They just didn't,

3416
02:17:44,140 --> 02:17:45,670
they just didn't think it was necessary.
And I was like,

3417
02:17:45,920 --> 02:17:48,280
that's crazy.
I've sparred with these guys getting

3418
02:17:48,281 --> 02:17:49,930
kicked in the legs.
It's fucking aWful.

3419
02:17:50,170 --> 02:17:51,990
I'm going to learn how to do this.
You guys.

3420
02:17:52,140 --> 02:17:53,950
I'm not,
I'm not gonna not learn this.

3421
02:17:53,951 --> 02:17:55,420
Somebody kicked my leg once.
I was like,

3422
02:17:55,510 --> 02:17:57,120
oh yeah,
okay.

3423
02:17:57,190 --> 02:17:58,390
That's okay.
We got,

3424
02:17:58,391 --> 02:18:01,360
we got a new thing to change this,
like I got to learn that same thing with

3425
02:18:01,370 --> 02:18:01,780
jujitsu.

3426
02:18:01,780 --> 02:18:03,190
As soon as I did jujitsu,
I was like,

3427
02:18:03,220 --> 02:18:05,290
I know how to fight.
I got fucking raped.

3428
02:18:05,590 --> 02:18:08,980
I mean literally like ragdoll by some
guy who is exactly the same size as me.

3429
02:18:08,990 --> 02:18:09,910
Like,
oh,

3430
02:18:09,911 --> 02:18:12,190
okay,
now I got to learn this because there's

3431
02:18:12,191 --> 02:18:14,860
no fucking way I can go through life
thinking I know how to fight,

3432
02:18:14,861 --> 02:18:16,060
why this guy's out there.
Okay.

3433
02:18:16,080 --> 02:18:17,540
It was a purple belt too.
It wasn't even like,

3434
02:18:17,890 --> 02:18:19,840
you know,
it wasn't bigger than me.

3435
02:18:19,890 --> 02:18:22,420
It was like close to my age.
He killed me.

3436
02:18:22,600 --> 02:18:23,740
And then even your,
I mean,

3437
02:18:23,741 --> 02:18:24,790
you're a black belt,
you're accomplished.

3438
02:18:24,791 --> 02:18:26,350
And then you roll someone like I rolled
with,

3439
02:18:26,590 --> 02:18:29,950
I'm fortunate enough to have some good
guys because I travel and you'll be

3440
02:18:29,951 --> 02:18:30,141
like,
oh,

3441
02:18:30,141 --> 02:18:31,030
okay,
here's a black belt.

3442
02:18:31,031 --> 02:18:33,580
This guy's kicking my ass.
And then it rolled with the worst I've

3443
02:18:33,581 --> 02:18:34,570
ever had in my life.

3444
02:18:35,110 --> 02:18:36,760
Nice guy.
So please don't mistake.

3445
02:18:36,761 --> 02:18:38,810
This was lucas late jay.
Um,

3446
02:18:39,100 --> 02:18:42,100
he was not flow like I've rolled with
marcelo garcia.

3447
02:18:42,101 --> 02:18:44,020
We've had boucher come.
And gabriel vela cyborg,

3448
02:18:44,021 --> 02:18:47,320
like all these different cities guys,
but lucas late,

3449
02:18:47,400 --> 02:18:49,840
I think it was just like if you're a
bigger guy and you go and you roll with

3450
02:18:49,841 --> 02:18:51,390
them and he actually accidentally,
he just,

3451
02:18:51,430 --> 02:18:53,060
he did a collar,
pole was key.

3452
02:18:53,061 --> 02:18:56,290
It was so hard.
I put my hand out to post and I popped

3453
02:18:56,291 --> 02:18:57,580
my shoulder out of the socket.
Oh,

3454
02:18:57,740 --> 02:19:00,970
the first 10 seconds.
And so then he gets my back and I was

3455
02:19:01,140 --> 02:19:02,640
able to.
But you can see.

3456
02:19:02,740 --> 02:19:03,940
And the tape,
I don't know if I still have it,

3457
02:19:03,941 --> 02:19:08,290
I'm doing this to turn your shoulder
back in and it was so fast.

3458
02:19:08,350 --> 02:19:09,490
I was like,
oh.

3459
02:19:09,760 --> 02:19:14,620
So that's what that's like because my
slo was so nice where they can get more,

3460
02:19:14,680 --> 02:19:15,640
more,
more pressure,

3461
02:19:15,641 --> 02:19:17,590
more pressure.
Because you always,

3462
02:19:17,591 --> 02:19:18,880
you never want to hurt the black.
Right?

3463
02:19:18,890 --> 02:19:19,360
RIght.
No,

3464
02:19:19,360 --> 02:19:20,350
there's no chance you.
I mean,

3465
02:19:20,360 --> 02:19:21,310
you could hurt them,
right?

3466
02:19:21,450 --> 02:19:23,400
You don't want to go agro on them.
Right.

3467
02:19:23,590 --> 02:19:25,000
Because these guys,
people want to take their head off,

3468
02:19:25,330 --> 02:19:26,650
you know what I mean?
And so you don't want to be that,

3469
02:19:26,651 --> 02:19:28,280
but late shay was just super

3470
02:19:28,280 --> 02:19:30,260
nice.
But pop my shoulder on 12 seconds,

3471
02:19:30,261 --> 02:19:33,440
just the guys that are like that.
They roll hard or they don't roll it

3472
02:19:33,441 --> 02:19:34,274
all,
you know,

3473
02:19:34,290 --> 02:19:35,030
it,
it.

3474
02:19:35,030 --> 02:19:35,990
I don't even know.
That was hard.

3475
02:19:35,991 --> 02:19:40,220
I think it was so swift from timer went
off and it was a basic.

3476
02:19:40,340 --> 02:19:43,630
He was sitting and just grab the collar
and just just like,

3477
02:19:43,880 --> 02:19:44,610
just pull.
That's it.

3478
02:19:44,610 --> 02:19:46,300
I guess you're kind of expecting that
go.

3479
02:19:46,370 --> 02:19:49,340
Toronto will make dragon will know.
Boom.

3480
02:19:49,500 --> 02:19:52,310
Oldschool collar,
yankee and I just posted and filter.

3481
02:19:52,820 --> 02:19:55,970
Did you find anything on Bruce Lee?
I started looking it up.

3482
02:19:56,000 --> 02:19:57,650
It's a bunch of like forum posts and
whatnot.

3483
02:19:57,651 --> 02:20:02,330
I found one blog post that has like the
annotated thing and it sort sorta shows

3484
02:20:02,331 --> 02:20:04,610
a quote from it and then says where the
quote was from.

3485
02:20:04,770 --> 02:20:07,430
Oh yeah.
It's not like the best.

3486
02:20:07,820 --> 02:20:10,610
All right,
well I hope I'm not wrong because this

3487
02:20:10,611 --> 02:20:13,880
is what somebody who I know and respect
very well told me.

3488
02:20:13,880 --> 02:20:15,560
and then I remember reading it
somewhere,

3489
02:20:15,890 --> 02:20:18,080
but again,
it doesn't take anything away from how I

3490
02:20:18,081 --> 02:20:21,410
feel about Bruce Lee.
I think he's very important in the

3491
02:20:21,411 --> 02:20:23,780
history of martial arts.
Maybe one of the most important figures

3492
02:20:23,781 --> 02:20:26,360
ever outside of hoists,
gracie and leo gracie.

3493
02:20:26,390 --> 02:20:28,760
It's those things where the truth is
enough and you wonder why people feel

3494
02:20:28,890 --> 02:20:30,760
like the truth isn't enough.
Right?

3495
02:20:31,130 --> 02:20:33,340
Like you don'T need to embellish it.
Like the truth was worship.

3496
02:20:33,500 --> 02:20:34,333
Yeah.
Yeah.

3497
02:20:34,370 --> 02:20:36,290
That being said,
it was a slightly racist caricature of

3498
02:20:36,291 --> 02:20:37,700
you as Bruce Lee.
In hindsight.

3499
02:20:37,701 --> 02:20:40,520
I can see how people are my tickets.
She put tape on your eyes.

3500
02:20:40,521 --> 02:20:41,600
No,
we did do that one.

3501
02:20:41,601 --> 02:20:44,470
So because we did him doing the mickey
rooney breakfast at tiffany's and so

3502
02:20:44,471 --> 02:20:45,500
people are like,
this is still racist.

3503
02:20:45,710 --> 02:20:47,390
He's literally a story.
Make your breakfast at tiffaNy's.

3504
02:20:47,391 --> 02:20:48,370
What do you think would make your own?

3505
02:20:48,380 --> 02:20:49,960
He's a white guy.
What the fuck is wrong with you?

3506
02:20:49,961 --> 02:20:51,200
I never saw that,
that I would have seen.

3507
02:20:51,230 --> 02:20:53,090
Oh my god.
it's hilarious.

3508
02:20:53,091 --> 02:20:53,781
Yeah.
Well,

3509
02:20:53,781 --> 02:20:55,610
how about when they used to have the guy
played charlie chan.

3510
02:20:55,650 --> 02:20:57,500
He was in the widest motherfucker that's
ever lived.

3511
02:20:58,070 --> 02:21:02,760
He's playing like a six foot three white
guy playing a chinese detective and like

3512
02:21:03,110 --> 02:21:05,570
they wouldn't let chinese people act
back then.

3513
02:21:05,900 --> 02:21:07,880
Like if you were going to make a major
role,

3514
02:21:07,940 --> 02:21:10,340
like the star of a movie,
you had to be a bike guy,

3515
02:21:10,341 --> 02:21:12,340
but we send the new spiderman though.
Yeah.

3516
02:21:12,380 --> 02:21:14,900
No.
You kind of wonder if that's something

3517
02:21:14,901 --> 02:21:17,100
we should be.
I hate to say.

3518
02:21:17,150 --> 02:21:20,210
Can you ask what can we address?
The elephant in the room was pretty

3519
02:21:20,211 --> 02:21:22,520
clear that often asians are not the best
actors.

3520
02:21:22,880 --> 02:21:26,270
You son of a bitch come on son of a
bitch.

3521
02:21:26,420 --> 02:21:27,590
How by it?
Yeah.

3522
02:21:27,591 --> 02:21:29,210
Well you never watched my age.
A career.

3523
02:21:29,211 --> 02:21:31,710
His movies.
that's why I backed,

3524
02:21:31,711 --> 02:21:33,800
you know in the nineties they just said
put dean cain in there.

3525
02:21:33,801 --> 02:21:35,410
Call it a day.
He's got to know cti.

3526
02:21:36,230 --> 02:21:37,990
She did some great work,
man.

3527
02:21:38,080 --> 02:21:40,880
I'm a porno star.
Some bench

3528
02:21:43,150 --> 02:21:46,640
who that's more embarrassing
for you.

3529
02:21:47,060 --> 02:21:49,840
It doesn't bother me at all.
Embarrassing.

3530
02:21:49,860 --> 02:21:52,810
It's embarrassing if you ever had dean
cain on the show by the.

3531
02:21:52,811 --> 02:21:53,271
No,
no.

3532
02:21:53,271 --> 02:21:54,440
I'd love to.
Oh my god.

3533
02:21:54,470 --> 02:21:55,850
Have you ever watched this princeton
highlight?

3534
02:21:56,030 --> 02:21:58,580
He said three.
Like all american records.

3535
02:21:58,640 --> 02:21:59,361
Really?
Yeah,

3536
02:21:59,361 --> 02:22:00,680
and football.
He's only like five,

3537
02:22:00,770 --> 02:22:03,320
11 ton of print.
Hundred eightY ton of princeton records.

3538
02:22:03,321 --> 02:22:06,830
But also the once I met him once,
it's something smart.

3539
02:22:06,831 --> 02:22:08,690
dude.
He did something with joey diaz.

3540
02:22:08,691 --> 02:22:11,030
He did a.
He did those movies like the dog who

3541
02:22:11,031 --> 02:22:12,140
saves christmas.
Yeah.

3542
02:22:12,170 --> 02:22:12,500
Oh yeah.

3543
02:22:12,500 --> 02:22:14,780
All the kids love those fucking movies.
Yeah.

3544
02:22:15,210 --> 02:22:17,480
Joey says he's a great guy.
he's a very nice guy.

3545
02:22:17,481 --> 02:22:18,530
Very smart.
Good.

3546
02:22:18,531 --> 02:22:20,070
Looking to the point of being
aggravated.

3547
02:22:20,071 --> 02:22:20,780
Comfortable,
right?

3548
02:22:20,780 --> 02:22:22,700
Yeah.
That fucking face handsome.

3549
02:22:22,970 --> 02:22:25,180
Look at him.
Look at his princeton highlight reel.

3550
02:22:25,280 --> 02:22:28,050
If you youtube dean cain highlight
football.

3551
02:22:28,080 --> 02:22:29,490
He's got an advantage of some of these
photos.

3552
02:22:29,910 --> 02:22:34,910
What would be next to joe?
The only guy that played superman that

3553
02:22:35,491 --> 02:22:37,860
didn't get like something really wrong
happen to them.

3554
02:22:37,861 --> 02:22:39,570
Right?
There was like a superman curse.

3555
02:22:40,170 --> 02:22:43,530
George reeves believes what?
What?

3556
02:22:43,540 --> 02:22:46,170
Brandon brandon routh just turned out to
suck.

3557
02:22:46,280 --> 02:22:48,620
Who's just turned out having to breton
around.

3558
02:22:49,470 --> 02:22:52,170
When does thAt happen?
That was one with kevin spacey is lex

3559
02:22:52,171 --> 02:22:52,681
luthor.
Remember?

3560
02:22:52,681 --> 02:22:54,630
That was a reboot.
Now I was gone by then.

3561
02:22:55,120 --> 02:22:56,610
I lefT the franchise.
Yeah.

3562
02:22:56,820 --> 02:22:58,590
I wasn't paying attention to the henry
capital.

3563
02:22:58,591 --> 02:23:01,620
Now is when do you get to the third
different spiderman?

3564
02:23:01,650 --> 02:23:03,150
I'm out.
Yeah,

3565
02:23:03,250 --> 02:23:05,130
I'm kinda done with superhero films now
for awhile,

3566
02:23:05,160 --> 02:23:06,570
unless there's something really
interesting.

3567
02:23:06,800 --> 02:23:08,100
No,
I'll still go see anything with the

3568
02:23:08,101 --> 02:23:09,420
hulk.
Oh really?

3569
02:23:09,500 --> 02:23:12,180
Was fun while been a longtime fucking
freaks out.

3570
02:23:12,181 --> 02:23:15,570
But now that mark rafala who's like
super social justice warriors,

3571
02:23:15,571 --> 02:23:18,160
the hall can do it.
You just separate the art from the

3572
02:23:18,210 --> 02:23:19,710
artist.
That's just that bernie prick.

3573
02:23:19,711 --> 02:23:21,450
I can't do this.
He's also,

3574
02:23:21,540 --> 02:23:22,380
he's,
he's just like,

3575
02:23:22,390 --> 02:23:24,590
he's a theorist too,
which is weird.

3576
02:23:24,700 --> 02:23:26,500
A socialist and he's like a conspiracy,
like,

3577
02:23:26,550 --> 02:23:28,040
you know,
rough low.

3578
02:23:28,590 --> 02:23:30,930
I don't want to speak out of school,
but I think he has a brain tumor.

3579
02:23:31,840 --> 02:23:35,790
Doesn't feel like a jerk.
I might be making a left today with a

3580
02:23:35,791 --> 02:23:38,520
brain tumor all in mark refollow has
brain cancer.

3581
02:23:38,521 --> 02:23:40,140
We've all gOt a lot of growing up.
I'm sorry.

3582
02:23:40,141 --> 02:23:41,460
I love doing as well as your interviews.

3583
02:23:42,980 --> 02:23:47,070
No one talks about his article.
He talks about his brother's murder and

3584
02:23:47,071 --> 02:23:49,010
his brain tumor.
Oh see there you go.

3585
02:23:49,020 --> 02:23:51,820
It's gonna bring you asshole.
So that

3586
02:23:55,630 --> 02:23:57,210
opens up a bar.
Yeah,

3587
02:23:57,211 --> 02:24:00,450
he's got a brain tumor.
So maybe that's where the conspiracy

3588
02:24:00,451 --> 02:24:02,700
theories are all coming from.
What conspiracy theories?

3589
02:24:02,910 --> 02:24:04,980
I don't remember him.
He was somewhere and it was like,

3590
02:24:04,981 --> 02:24:05,810
you know,
I,

3591
02:24:05,810 --> 02:24:06,690
I don't,
I couldn't tell you.

3592
02:24:06,691 --> 02:24:09,100
I wouldn't want to speak out of turn,
but I have been surprised because I knew

3593
02:24:09,110 --> 02:24:11,460
it was far left.
It was like kind of like big brother

3594
02:24:11,461 --> 02:24:11,971
government.
I'm like,

3595
02:24:11,971 --> 02:24:13,470
oh,
that's weird for You to think big

3596
02:24:13,471 --> 02:24:15,120
brother's watching,
but want a bigger,

3597
02:24:15,121 --> 02:24:16,560
big brother.
All right,

3598
02:24:16,620 --> 02:24:17,400
right,
right.

3599
02:24:17,400 --> 02:24:18,330
Yeah,
that's the problem,

3600
02:24:18,331 --> 02:24:20,850
right?
They think nine slash 11 truther oh,

3601
02:24:21,710 --> 02:24:23,250
is that one of them?
Oh,

3602
02:24:23,380 --> 02:24:25,620
mark.
Marky mark.

3603
02:24:27,230 --> 02:24:30,210
AnoTher one of those things.
It's like you look at it after the fact

3604
02:24:30,211 --> 02:24:31,950
and you go look at all these
connections,

3605
02:24:31,951 --> 02:24:32,640
like,
okay,

3606
02:24:32,640 --> 02:24:34,830
maybe,
maybe just chaos.

3607
02:24:34,830 --> 02:24:37,500
And two guys flew planes into.
Or a bunch of guys flew planes into

3608
02:24:37,501 --> 02:24:38,640
buildings.
Well,

3609
02:24:38,910 --> 02:24:41,640
the problem is I think they're
capitalizing what we were talking about.

3610
02:24:41,700 --> 02:24:42,930
RighT?
Which is real.

3611
02:24:42,990 --> 02:24:45,360
No one wanted to cover the entire issue.
No one wants to.

3612
02:24:45,390 --> 02:24:48,090
No one wants to talk about the puberty
blockers to kids and this being

3613
02:24:48,091 --> 02:24:49,770
considered hate speech.
It's true.

3614
02:24:49,800 --> 02:24:51,690
There is a media coverup of a lot of
information.

3615
02:24:51,691 --> 02:24:55,730
Certainly I would say sort of a cover up
there is a monopoly on informational

3616
02:24:55,800 --> 02:24:56,730
distribution,
right?

3617
02:24:56,790 --> 02:24:58,770
That's real.
That's real people.

3618
02:24:58,771 --> 02:25:00,600
When you find that out,
it kind of opens your eyes.

3619
02:25:00,601 --> 02:25:00,991
You're goIng,
okay,

3620
02:25:00,991 --> 02:25:04,710
what else don't I know so people take
that and then try and capitalize on it

3621
02:25:04,860 --> 02:25:08,850
with lies,
which is you didn't know jay z's in the

3622
02:25:08,851 --> 02:25:12,120
illuminati.
Nine slash 11 was an inside job and it

3623
02:25:12,121 --> 02:25:15,900
just goes on because there's some truth
to it and you put the problem is you

3624
02:25:15,901 --> 02:25:17,720
want to get people searching,
but it does it.

3625
02:25:17,790 --> 02:25:20,250
Truth has to run.
Your post office orchestrated the

3626
02:25:20,251 --> 02:25:23,500
biggest terror attack on american soil.
There's unquestionably.

3627
02:25:23,501 --> 02:25:24,340
There were some

3628
02:25:25,330 --> 02:25:30,330
taking advantage of the events in order
to pass policy that wasn't possible

3629
02:25:30,461 --> 02:25:34,810
before and the patriot act,
the patriot act was drafted long before

3630
02:25:34,811 --> 02:25:37,580
nine slash 11 and they pushed it through
and then there's.

3631
02:25:37,630 --> 02:25:41,980
There's a lot that I think you could
attribute to them taking advantage of

3632
02:25:42,040 --> 02:25:45,160
this tragedy,
but the idea that they orchestrated it,

3633
02:25:45,400 --> 02:25:46,240
man,
this just.

3634
02:25:46,780 --> 02:25:48,100
It doesn't.
It doesn't.

3635
02:25:48,450 --> 02:25:50,770
The burden,
the burden of proof is on them to say

3636
02:25:50,771 --> 02:25:53,920
that when they did see loose change,
you know,

3637
02:25:53,921 --> 02:25:57,880
there's a lot of people that believe.
What I find that crazy about that is

3638
02:25:57,881 --> 02:25:58,570
that,
you know,

3639
02:25:58,570 --> 02:26:01,030
this crazy corrupt government than nine
slash 11 commission report.

3640
02:26:01,031 --> 02:26:01,930
Okay.
George bush,

3641
02:26:02,230 --> 02:26:03,130
like a mark,
rough flow.

3642
02:26:03,280 --> 02:26:05,170
But theN you look at the drone strikes
with baraka was like,

3643
02:26:05,470 --> 02:26:06,670
all of a sudden,
where's code?

3644
02:26:06,820 --> 02:26:09,250
All of thIs goes away.
There's one that's consistent.

3645
02:26:09,251 --> 02:26:09,400
Now.

3646
02:26:09,400 --> 02:26:11,530
I don't hate George Bush.
I know I'm probably in the minority

3647
02:26:11,531 --> 02:26:12,820
here.
I don't think it was a great president.

3648
02:26:12,821 --> 02:26:14,230
I don't think he's as bad as a lot of
people,

3649
02:26:14,231 --> 02:26:15,430
you know,
green day thinks he was.

3650
02:26:15,580 --> 02:26:20,020
I don't think it was a great president,
but the point is I don't want George

3651
02:26:20,020 --> 02:26:23,110
Bush to have unfettered power,
nor barack obama nor Donald Trump.

3652
02:26:23,140 --> 02:26:25,630
It's not selective.
I don't trust any of them.

3653
02:26:26,110 --> 02:26:28,090
Yeah.
Mike baker used to be in the cia,

3654
02:26:28,120 --> 02:26:32,300
told me that those drone strikes are,
those are designed or rather,

3655
02:26:32,301 --> 02:26:34,360
um,
dictated by lawyers.

3656
02:26:34,720 --> 02:26:35,481
Like when,
what,

3657
02:26:35,481 --> 02:26:38,290
what gets passed and what gets passed
through its lawyers.

3658
02:26:38,291 --> 02:26:40,360
Lawyers make the final decision and I
was like,

3659
02:26:40,361 --> 02:26:41,051
really?
And he's like,

3660
02:26:41,051 --> 02:26:42,100
yeah,
lawyers.

3661
02:26:42,340 --> 02:26:43,420
They decide like,
hey,

3662
02:26:43,421 --> 02:26:45,400
you know what,
